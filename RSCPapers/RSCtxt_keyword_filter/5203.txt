Transition-metal selenides have recently been demonstrated as promising non-precious metal electrocatalysts for the triiodide reduction reaction. Herein, we prepared a series of transition-metal selenides via a free-reductant solvothermal method and used them as counter-electrodes in high efficiency dye-sensitized solar cells. The electrochemical results showed that these selenides had excellent catalytic activity for the reduction of the triiodine/iodine couple, and except for MoSe2, the conversion efficiencies of the corresponding dye-sensitized solar cells were comparable to the sputtered Pt counter-electrode. Theoretical investigation clearly revealed that the unsatisfactory performance of MoSe2 mainly originated from the processes of adsorption and charge-transfer. These findings can help to better understand the electrocatalytic processes and thus offer some useful guidelines to develop more efficient electrochemical catalysts.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are typical third-generation photovoltaic devices with a mesoporous architecture and some attractive features, such as cost effectiveness, environment friendliness, easy processing, and relatively high power conversion efficiency (PCE).1 Over the past two decades, DSCs have been intensively studied to improve their photovoltaic performance and reduce the production cost.2 Among the basic components of DSCs is the counter-electrode (CE), which has two important roles: to collect electrons from the external circuit; and to transfer the electrons to recycle the redox species of the redox couple (I3−/I−) through catalytic reduction. Thus, the nature of a CE is important in determining the photovoltaic performance of DSCs. Superior CE catalysts possess high electrocatalytic activity, good electrical conductivity, and chemical stability.3 Based on these standards, platinum is a noble metal that has been widely used to fabricate efficient CEs for DSCs, such as sputtering Pt or pyrolytic Pt. Nevertheless, the high cost, limited resources, and corrosion by iodine species in electrolyte solution seriously restrict the large-scale application of Pt-based CEs in DSCs.2a Therefore, economic, stable, and effective non-Pt catalysts should be exploited to fabricate novel CEs.
Recently, our group has developed some inorganic compounds, such as oxides,4 nitrides,5 carbides,6 sulfides,7 phosphides,8 and tellurides,9 for the fabrication of non-Pt CEs. As emerging functional materials, transition-metal selenides (TMSs) have drawn much interest because of their excellent semiconductor properties, photoelectric effects, and nonlinear optical characteristics. TMSs have been widely studied in the field of luminescence, display, infrared detection, and photocatalysis.10 TMSs also possess unique electrical properties, interesting chemical behaviour, and good chemical stability,11 which are suitable for use as electrocatalysts. Despite being used for the oxygen reduction reaction in fuel cells,12 TMSs have been applied as CEs in DSCs only two years ago.13 For DSCs, TMS-CEs are comparable with conventional Pt-CEs in terms of conversion efficiency. For example, Co0.85Se, Ni0.85Se and NiSe2 were synthesized via a hydrothermal route in situ on FTO substrates and used directly as CEs in DSCs by Gong et al., in which high PCEs are obtained, even better than Pt-CEs.13a,b In 2013, our group reported the superior catalytic activity of NbSe2 with different nanostructures that were prepared through a facile and reductant-free solvothermal approach. The NbSe2-based CEs also demonstrated a comparable performance to Pt-CEs in DSCs.13c Although TMSs are suitable for use as CE materials and can significantly replace Pt in DSCs, the origin of high electrocatalytic activity of TMSs remains unclear. Only a few reports have provided theoretical investigation of the electrocatalytic behaviours of TMSs as CEs in DSCs.
In the current study, to research the catalytic regularity, we designed and synthesized three TMSs (MoSe2, WSe2, and TaSe2) with similar crystal structures through a reductant-free solvothermal route. The crystal structures, morphologies, and electrocatalytic behaviour of the three TMSs were characterized. As CEs, WSe2 and TaSe2 exhibited higher electrocatalytic activities and better performance than MoSe2, and PCEs of their corresponding DSCs nearly approached those of the DSCs with a Pt-CE. Theoretical discussions on the electrocatalytic activity were performed based on the density functional theory (DFT). The unsatisfactory performance of MoSe2 mainly originated from the processes of adsorption and charge transfer. Our experimental and theoretical results provide helpful information in understanding the electrocatalytic processes and offer some useful guidelines to develop more efficient CEs in DSCs.
2. Experimental
2.1 Material preparation
TMS nanostructures were synthesized via a method reported by our group,13c metal chlorides were used as metal precursors and Se powder was used as the selenium source. As an example, for WSe2, in a typical procedure, WCl6 and Se powders (molar ratio of 1:2) were mixed and added to moderate oleylamine (OLA) degassed with N2 at room temperature. Subsequently the reaction mixture was transferred into a three-neck round-bottom flask, sealed, and degassed with high purity N2 under magnetic stirring and heated to react for 4 h at 280 °C in a N2 atmosphere with vigorous agitation. Finally, the mixture was slowly cooled down to room temperature with an appropriate speed, and black products were obtained. A large amount of hexane was then added to the crude solution and the products were isolated by centrifugation repeatedly, dried under vacuum, and heated at 450 °C for 3 h under a N2 atmosphere.
2.2 Preparation of TMS counter-electrodes and cell fabrication
A 12 μm thick TiO2 film (P25, Degussa, Germany) was loaded onto FTO glass by a screen-printing technique, sensitized with N719 dye (Solaronix SA, Aubonne, Switzerland) and used as a photoanode. The TMS counter-electrodes were fabricated with a spray-coating technique as follows. 200 mg of the as-prepared TMSs were dispersed in 4 mL of isopropanol and milled with a star ball mill (QM-QX04, Nanjing NanDa Instrument Plant) for 4 h and the slurry for spraying was obtained. The prepared slurry was sprayed onto a FTO glass substrate (Asahi Glass, type-U, 14 Ω sq−1, Japan) using an air brush (TD-128, Tiandi Co., Ltd) connected to a mini compressor. The thickness of selenide CEs was around 8 μm. Subsequently, the FTO glass coated with various pastes was then sintered under a N2 atmosphere at 500 °C for 30 min in a tube furnace and the CEs were prepared. The Pt CE was prepared in accordance with the procedure reported in our previous work.14 A DSC device was fabricated with a photoanode, a counter-electrode and a redox electrolyte. The redox electrolyte contained 0.06 M LiI, 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.03 M I2, 0.5 M 4-tert-butyl pyridine, and 0.1 M guanidiniumthiocyanate in acetonitrile solution and injected into the interspace between the photoanode and the counter-electrode via capillary force. The two electrodes were sealed with double-faced insulated adhesive tapes. The active area of the as-assembled DSCs was 0.16 cm2. A symmetrical cell was assembled by sandwiching two identical CEs with the same electrolyte as used in the DSC assembly. The as-assembled symmetrical cell was then subjected to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Tafel polarization measurements.
2.3 Characterization of CE materials and DSCs
The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements of the synthesized selenide samples were performed using an automatic X-ray powder diffractometer (D/Max 2400, Rigaku, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). The surface morphological characteristics and the microstructure of the selenide samples were examined through a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, FEI HITACHI S-4800) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOJ-2010) with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms were collected using a Tristar II 3020, Micromeritics adsorption analyzer at 77 K. Prior to adsorption measurements, the samples were degassed at 200 °C for at least 10 h. Pore size distributions (PSD) were calculated using the adsorption branch of the isotherms by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. The total pore volume was estimated from the adsorption volume at a relative pressure (P/P0) of 0.99. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out in a three-electrode system of anhydrous acetonitrile solution containing 0.1 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI, and 1 mM I2 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 using a CHI630D electrochemical workstation (Chenhua, Shanghai). The as-prepared selenide CE was assigned as a working electrode; a Pt wire was utilized as a counter-electrode; and an Ag/AgCl electrode was used as a reference electrode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted using the dummy cell on a computer-controlled electrochemical workstation (Zennium Zahner, Germany) under dark conditions. The geometric active area of the symmetrical cell was 0.64 cm2. The measured frequency ranged from 100 mHz to 1 MHz with a bias of −0.75 V and the AC amplitude of the alternating current was set to be 10 mV. The obtained EIS data were analyzed using commercially available Z-view software and fitted in terms of an appropriate equivalent electric circuit. Tafel polarization measurements were performed using an electrochemical workstation system (CHI630D, Chenhua, Shanghai). The scan rate was 10 mV s−1. The photovoltaic performance of the DSCs was evaluated using a Keithley digital source meter (Keithley 2601, USA) under simulated sunlight illumination conditions (Xe arc lamp, 1.5 AM, 100 mW cm−2, PEC-L15, Peccell, Japan).
3. Computational method
DFT computations were performed using projector augmented wave (PAW) potentials in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).15–18 Relaxations were carried out using the conjugate-gradient algorithm, and stopped if all forces were smaller than 0.01 eV Å−1. LDA functionals are employed for MoSe2, WSe2, and TaSe2 which have a hexagonal crystal structure. The occupancy of the one-electron states was calculated using the Gaussian smearing (SIGMA = 0.1 eV). When the band structure was calculated, the primitive cell of the three transition metal selenides was used. Brillouin-zone integrations were performed using Monkhorst–Pack grids of special points with 11 × 11 × 11 meshes. The kinetic-energy cutoff of plane waves was set to be 290 eV. The energy convergence was selected to be 1 × 10−5 eV per atom.
As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the fringe spacing was 0.282 nm and 0.283 nm which agreed well with the values of (100) lattice planes of hexagonal MoSe2 and WSe2. Considering that the mostly exposed surfaces were perpendicular to the surfaces with corresponding fringe spacing, MoSe2(001) and WSe2(001) surfaces were chosen as the computational models, which were modeled as p(2 × 2) periodic slabs with 6 atomic layers and the vacuum between the slabs was 20 Å. The atoms in the bottom layer were fixed, and all the other atoms were fully relaxed. A corresponding 3 × 3 × 1 k-point mesh was applied during optimizations.
4. Results and discussion
4.1 Morphology and structure characterization
The crystal structures of the as-obtained three samples were characterized by XRD analysis (Fig. S1, ESI†). First, all of the diffraction peaks in curves (a), (b), and (c) could be well-designated to JCPDS No. 29-0914, 38-1388, and 19-1303, respectively, which were all identified as hexagonal crystal structures. The lattice parameters of the three samples are: a = 3.287 Å and c = 12.925 Å for MoSe2, a = 3.286 Å and c = 12.983 Å for WSe2, and a = 3.436 Å and c = 12.696 Å for TaSe2, indicating that their crystal structures are almost similar. In general, diselenide (MSe2) has layered structures, in which the metal ion possesses a six-coordinate trigonal-prismatic structure.19 The XRD peak assignments of the three samples are shown in the ESI.† No impurity peak was observed in all of the XRD patterns (Fig. S1, ESI†).
The morphologies of the as-synthesized three TMSs were investigated by SEM and TEM (Fig. 1 and Fig. S2 and S3, ESI†). MoSe2 is composed of interlaced and ultrathin nanosheets (Fig. 1a). The thickness of the MoSe2 nanosheets is approximately 10 nm with typical lateral dimensions between 100 and 150 nm. The MoSe2 nanosheets are also inclined to form connected spheres. Similar to MoSe2, WSe2 is composed of several interlaced nanoplates with an average thickness of approximately 15 nm and a width between 60 and 100 nm, which are slightly smaller than those of the MoSe2 nanosheets (Fig. 1b). The structural advantages of the interlaced nanosheets or nanoplates are evident as they can offer a large specific area that can be accessed with ease by the adsorbate; a large specific area is also favorable to desorption of the product. In these two nanostructures, the grain boundaries that hinder the electron transport should be minimized. These structural advantages are desired with regard to enhanced electrocatalytic activity and have been proven by subsequent electrochemical and photovoltaic measurements. The SEM image of TaSe2 illustrates that its dominant structures are fluffy nanoparticles with a very wide size distribution (Fig. 1c). TEM images of three TMS CE materials are given in Fig. 1d–f. MoSe2 showed interconnected nanosheets. WSe2 exhibited nanoplates connected with each other. TaSe2 showed irregular nanoparticle aggregates. The HRTEM images of MoSe2, WSe2, and TaSe2 (Fig. S3, ESI†) show lattice fringes with spacing of 0.282 nm, 0.283 nm, and 0.291 nm, corresponding to the (100), (100), and (101) planes of hexagonal MoSe2, WSe2, and TaSe2, respectively.

Nitrogen adsorption isotherms were measured to investigate the pore structure of the three as-prepared materials. The isotherms of all samples are of type-IV with a distinct hysteresis loop at relative pressures (P/P0) from 0.45 to 1.0 (Fig. 2), suggesting the presence of mesopores in these materials. The pore size distribution (PSD) curve of WSe2 is centred at approximately 43 nm whereas that of MoSe2 is centered at approximately 30 nm, which is larger than that of TaSe2 (≈10 nm). The PSD results further confirm the mesoporous structure of the three materials (inset of Fig. 2). The mesoporous architecture of WSe2 can facilitate the I3− adsorption and molecular transport during the catalytic reaction process. The Bruanauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and the total pore volume of WSe2 were estimated to be 95.6 m2 g−1 and 0.32 cm3 g−1, in contrast to those of MoSe2 (104.4 m2 g−1 and 0.41 cm3 g−1) and TaSe2 (78.8 m2 g−1 and 0.14 cm3 g−1). The difference in the surface area and the pore size distribution of catalytic materials caused the difference in adsorption properties for the I3−/I− system and showed a change in the catalytic activity and electrochemical properties, which impacted the photoelectric performance of DSCs.

4.2 Electrochemical characterization of CEs
The electrochemical catalytic activities of the three TMS-CEs for I3− reduction were also evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). For comparison, the CV characterization of the Pt-CE was performed under the same conditions. Fig. 3 shows the CV curves of I3−/I− redox couples using different CEs. For each CE, two typical pairs of oxidation and reduction peaks can be resolved. The redox couple at lower potential peaks (between 0.2 and 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl) corresponds to the reaction of I3− + 2e− → 3I−, and the redox couple at higher potential peaks (between 0.6 and 0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl) corresponds to the reaction of 3I2 + 2e− → 2I3−. According to the reaction of I3−/I−, the cathodic peak current density (Jpc1) and the anodic peak current density (Jpa1) reflect the reduction of the I3− ions and the oxidation of the I− ions, respectively. The peak-to-peak separation (Epp) also corresponds to the reversibility of the redox reaction. As shown in Fig. 3, the CV profile of the three TMS-CEs are similar to that of the Pt-CE, indicating that these TMS-CEs are as effective as Pt in catalyzing the reduction of I3− to I−. For the WSe2 CE, Jpc1 is slightly higher than that of the Pt-CE, and the cathodic peak potentials are similar to Pt, suggesting that I3− can be reduced more easily on the WSe2 CE. By contrast, for the TaSe2 and MoSe2 CEs, the cathodic peak potentials and Jpc1 are generally lower than that of the Pt-CE, indicating that the catalytic activity of these two TMS-CEs for the reduction of I3− is inferior to that of Pt. Among the four CEs, the reduction current density of MoSe2 is the lowest. Considering the larger surface area, MoSe2 has a relatively low catalytic activity. The three TMS-CEs also exhibit smaller Epp than that of Pt, suggesting good reversibility of the redox reaction. The TMS-CEs have low onset oxidation potential and oxidation peak potential, that is, the overpotential of the I− oxidation reaction is lower, indicating that the I− ion is easy to oxidize. Compared to TaSe2 and MoSe2, WSe2 has a higher oxidation current density, suggesting that I− has a fast oxidation rate on the surface of WSe2. Thus, the catalytic activity of WSe2 for the reduction of I3− and the oxidation of I− is comparable to the Pt-CE and much better than the MoSe2-based CE. The electrochemical stability of CE materials is of great significance in terms of further application in DSCs. In this work, by means of consecutive CV measurements, we elucidated the stability of our three TMS-based CEs in electrolyte solution. As can be seen in Fig. S4 (ESI†), 50 CV curves coincide very well, indicating that our three TMS-based CEs all have good stability under practical working conditions.

To investigate the electrochemical characteristics of these three TMS-based CEs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed with the use of symmetric cells consisting of two identical electrodes sandwiching the electrolyte (CE//electrolyte//CE) under dark conditions. Fig. 4 shows the Nyquist plots obtained at −0.75 V bias. The equivalent circuit for fitting the resultant impedance spectra using Z-view software is shown in the inset of Fig. 4. Detailed EIS parameters are summarized in Table 1. Owing to the symmetric configuration of the dummy cell, the real Rct was calculated as half of the value obtained from the Z-view fitting. The Nyquist plots illustrate the impedance characteristics, in which two semicircles can be observed at the high-frequency (left) and low-frequency (right) regions. The intercept on the real axis (Z′ axis) at the high-frequency region represents the series resistance (Rs). The semicircle at the high-frequency regions arises from the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) of the electrolyte/electrode interface, which reflects the electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction in the electrolyte and the corresponding constant phase element (CPE). The second semicircle at the low-frequency region is derived from the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN) of I3−/I− within the electrolyte. In contrast to the Pt-CE, a larger Rs value of the TMS-based CEs can be observed. The Rs value is mainly composed of the resistance of the FTO substrate, the bulk resistance of TMSs, and the contact resistance. The higher bulk resistance of TMSs and the worse adhesion between selenides and the FTO substrate should be responsible for the higher Rs values. The Rs values of three TMS-CEs were very close, indicating similar conductivity. Among the three TMS-based CEs, the Rs value of TaSe2 was the minimum. On the basis of the diameters of the first semicircles and the fitted results (Table 1), the Rct value for the WSe2-CE (0.78 Ω cm2) is smaller than that of the Pt-CE (1.32 Ω cm2), whereas those of the TaSe2 (1.89 Ω cm2) and MoSe2 (2.43 Ω cm2) CEs are larger than that of the Pt-CE. These results suggest that WSe2 possesses superior electrocatalytic activity for I3− electrochemical reduction. Among the three TMS-CEs, WSe2 and MoSe2 demonstrate higher CPE values, thereby indicating a large contact surface area between the CE and the electrolyte.20 The ionic ZN of WSe2 is 1.15 Ω cm2, which is lower than that of the other two CEs and close to that of the Pt-CE, thereby suggesting a larger apparent diffusion coefficient of I3− within the CEs. These findings could be attributed to the suitable pore structures of WSe2. The conductivity of the CE material is an important factor for the performance of DSCs. Conductivities of these three TMS-CEs were characterized by linear sweep voltammetry using two counter-electrodes, as reported previously.21 As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the slopes of three curves decrease gradually according to the order of TaSe2, MoSe2, and WSe2, indicating the same change in the order of conductivity for our three TMS materials. This result is consistent with the changing rules of Rs.

 Fig. 4  Nyquist plots of the EIS spectra for the symmetrical cells fabricated with two identical electrodes in the I3−/I− electrolyte system. The inset shows the equivalent circuit of the symmetrical cells for Nyquist plot fitting. 
To further elucidate the electrocatalytic activities, we measured the Tafel curves of the three TMSs and Pt-CEs using the dummy cells in the EIS experiments, and the results are shown in Fig. 5. As shown in Fig. 5, the Tafel curve demonstrates the logarithmic current density (LogJ) as a function of the potential (V). The exchange current density J0 and the limiting diffusion current density (Jlim) related to the catalytic activity of the catalysts can be obtained from the Tafel curves. From Fig. 5 and Table 1, the WSe2 CE exhibits a large slope compared with the Pt-CE, indicating a high J0 value. This result proves that the WSe2 CE has high catalytic activity for the reduction of I3− to I−. Similar to WSe2, the TaSe2-based CE also shows a considerable catalytic activity. However, in the case of the MoSe2-based CE, the gentle slope shows a relatively lower catalytic activity. J0 can also be calculated using eqn (1), where R is the gas constant, F is the Faraday constant, T is the temperature, and n is the number of electrons in the reduction of I3− at the electrolyte/CE interface. Combined with the corresponding EIS results, the change in the tendency of J0 on the three TMS-CEs is generally consistent with the overall Tafel-polarization measurements. (1)

Furthermore, the current density of WSe2 at a relatively high potential (U > 0.2 V) in the Tafel curve is larger than MoSe2 and TaSe2, indicating a fast diffusion velocity of the redox couple, similar to the Pt CE. This can be attributed to its larger pore diameter.
4.3 Photovoltaic performance of DSCs

Fig. 6 shows the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the DSCs fabricated using TMS-CEs and the Pt-CE. The photovoltaic parameters of the DSCs are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, the DSCs based on TMS-CEs exhibit the same VOC value (0.73 V), higher than that of the one with Pt-CE (0.70 V). This phenomenon could be attributed to the relatively high Rs value of selenide CEs that has been revealed by the aforementioned EIS measurements according to the literature.13c,22 The DSCs based on three TMS-CEs have lower JSC than those based on the Pt-CE. The higher total internal series resistance and the increased Nernst diffusion impedance of TMS-CEs derived from the thick catalyst layer might be responsible for it, which is also consistent with the aforementioned EIS measurements.23 The DSCs based on TaSe2 and WSe2 have larger JSC than those based on MoSe2. The photocurrent of DSCs may be affected by many factors, including electrical conductivity, electrocatalytic activity, electrolyte diffusion, etc. TaSe2 has good electrical conductivity as shown in the EIS measurements, conductivity experiments, and subsequent energy band calculation results. This is conducive to the charge transfer, which leads to higher JSC. WSe2 has good catalytic activity and larger pores which are in favor of catalytic regeneration and mass transfer of I3−. But its conductivity is slightly worse, which leads to a slightly lower JSC than TaSe2. The lowest JSC was obtained for the MoSe2 CE because of its worst catalytic activity and inferior ability for donating electrons confirmed by the subsequent calculation.24 The good catalytic activity of WSe2 resulted in the largest FF, thus obtaining a higher conversion efficiency. For the DSCs based on TaSe2 and WSe2, PCEs of 7.32% and 7.48% were obtained, respectively, compared with that using the Pt-CE (7.91%). Finally, lower VOC and JSC were observed for the device with a MoSe2 CE, in which a lower PCE of 6.70% was obtained.

4.4 Theoretical investigation
The abnormal catalytic activity of MoSe2 CEs prompted us to explore them using density functional theory (DFT). Firstly, we calculated their band structure and the results are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). MoSe2 and WSe2 show bandgaps of 1.33 and 1.51 eV, respectively. Interestingly, although the profile of the band structure of TaSe2 is similar to that of MoSe2 or WSe2, TaSe2 shows metallicity because its Fermi level is through some band. Thus, the bulk resistance of TaSe2 is smaller than those of MoSe2 and WSe2 and may be used to interpret the fact that the corresponding CE showed smaller Rs in EIS measurements.
Although they possessed similar crystal structures, morphology, and band structure, MoSe2 and WSe2 exhibit obvious differences in electrocatalytic properties in the experiment. To further explore the origin of the catalytic activity differences for MoSe2 and WSe2, we calculated the adsorption process of the I3−/I− redox couple on the surface of MoSe2(001) and WSe2(001). The molecular I3 complex is considered for calculations in this study, given the charge neutrality in typical DFT calculations.25 I− is then generated from the induced bond elongation by extracting charges from the CE in the decomposition of molecular I3 into three ions. To determine the energetically preferred adsorption, the molecular I3 complex was placed initially on different sites, e.g., top, bridge, and hollow. Fig. 7 shows the structures of I3 and its adsorption on the MoSe2(001) and WSe2(001) surfaces, and the corresponding projected density of states (PDOS). The results indicate that the I3 complex is preferentially adsorbed at the top of Se on the MoSe2(001) surface and the hollow of the WSe2(001) surface. When only the I3 complex is optimized, the I1–I2 bond is 2.86 Å. The I1–I2 bond can be elongated to 2.88 Å for the WSe2(001) surface and was shortened to 2.76 Å for the MoSe2(001) surface. The variation of the I1–I2 bond length indicated that the dissociation of the I3 complex on the WSe2(001) surface is more conducive than the MoSe2(001) surface. Bader charge analysis suggests that the I3 complex gains approximately 0.14e from the WSe2(001) surface but only 0.11e from the MoSe2(001) surface. Thus, the WSe2 nanoparticles are more efficient in regenerating I3−/I− redox couples in DSCs than the MoSe2 nanoparticles. The theoretical calculation results agree well with the experimental data for the two CEs.
 Fig. 7  Side views of I3 complex adsorption on (a) MoSe2(001) and (b) WSe2(001) surfaces, (c) the optimized I3 complex, and projected density of states (PDOS) for I3 complex adsorption on (d) MoSe2(001) and (e) WSe2(001) surfaces. The Fermi energy is at 0 eV. 
We further analyzed the projected density of states (PDOS) diagram for I3− MoSe2 and I3− WSe2 in the configuration as shown in Fig. 7d and e. From the PDOS diagram, we can see that the I 5p orbital, W and Mo d orbitals, and the Se 4p orbital exist in obvious hybridization, indicating the relatively large binding energy of the I3 complex adsorbed onto WSe2(001) or MoSe2(001). When the I3 complex was adsorbed onto WSe2(001) surfaces, around the Fermi level, I 5p electrons present five obvious isolated peaks, and there is a very complete overlapping with W 5d and Se 4p states at −0.8 eV. Meanwhile, a slight weak overlapping exists at around 2.5 eV. For MoSe2, the overlapping at −0.8 eV is significantly poor, and no obvious overlapping is observed at 2.5 eV. Considering the above results, the WSe2(001) surface is more conducive to the adsorption of the I3 complex than the MoSe2(001) surface.
Thus, the WSe2 nanoparticles are more efficient in regenerating I3−/I− redox couples in DSCs than the MoSe2 nanoparticles, and then exhibit superior catalytic activity. The theoretical calculation results agree well with the experimental data for the two CEs. To further research the difference in the electrocatalytic activity, we calculated the ionization energy (IP) of WSe2 and MoSe2. As is well known, at the CE surface, where the electrons flow through the CE to the electrolyte, the main process is the reduction of electron acceptors in the electrolyte, which can be presented as: I3−(sol) + 2e− → 3I−(sol). Therefore, if the CE material can easily yield electrons to the redox species in the electrolyte, the CE catalytic performance can be significantly improved. According to Koopman's theorem,26 the IP for a semiconductor is approximately equal to the negative valence-band maximum (VBM) energy when the vacuum level is set as the zero energy. The IP is calculated using eqn (2), where EVBM is the energy of the VBM and E0 is the vacuum level. The vacuum level and the band structure of MoSe2(001) and WSe2(001) surfaces are calculated using DFT (Fig. S7, ESI†). The VBM energies of MoSe2(001) and WSe2(001) are −0.50 and −0.47 eV; the vacuum levels are 5.14 eV and 4.85 eV; thus, the corresponding IPs of MoSe2(001) and WSe2(001) are 5.64 eV and 5.32 eV, respectively (Fig. S7, ESI†). Compared with WSe2, the IP of MoSe2 is obviously higher, suggesting the inferior ability for donating electrons of MoSe2. The result is completely consistent with the preceding analysis. Thus, considering the dissociation of the I3 complex and the electron donating ability, WSe2 has better electrocatalytic activity than MoSe2. The reason caused the bad electronic ability of the MoSe2 CE which needs to be further studied. IP = E0 − EVBM(2)
5. Conclusions
In summary, we selected three metal elements with different outer electronic structures as our research object, and compared the catalytic activities of the three targeted TMSs with similar crystal structures, through experimental validation and DFT computation. Our experiment suggests that these non-precious selenide materials exhibited different electrocatalytic activities in the reduction of I3−, and WSe2 displayed the best electrocatalytic activity among the three samples. DSCs with a WSe2-based CE achieved a high PCE comparable to that of those based on a sputtered Pt-CE. Our computational results suggested that the bond length of I–I in the I3 complex was elongated on the WSe2(001) surface. The hybridization of the I5p orbital and the WSe2 surface was stronger than MoSe2, which is conducive to the charge transfer from TMSs to I3−. These results indicated that the catalyst's composition and electronic structure have a great influence on the catalytic activity. This work may provide a theoretical basis for the development of effective non-Pt catalysts and the research of catalytic mechanisms in the future.
