    , Accepted 6th December 2018First published on 17th December 2018AbstractPhotocatalytic Z-scheme water splitting is regarded as a promising approach for efficient conversion of solar energy into hydrogen.

Broader context
Solar fuel and solar electricity as clean and renewable energy carriers attract more and more attention from scientists to address energy and environmental issues. Artificial photosynthesis based on Z-scheme water splitting is regarded as a promising approach for solar-to-chemical energy conversion. However, the Z-scheme electron transfer pathway between two photosystems gives rise to substantial potential energy loss. Storing and converting the potential energy of the redox mediators in the electron transfer pathway is an available strategy to lower the energy loss and improve the solar energy conversion efficiency. Herein, on the basis of a theoretical understanding of the impact of the energy loss on the solar energy conversion, we proposed a strategy of integrating a redox flow battery (RFB) into the electron transfer pathway of a Z-scheme water splitting system with two redox-active species for enhancing solar energy conversion. Experimentally, we verified the proof of concept by constructing a bio-hybrid photosystem II–ZrO2/TaON Z-scheme water splitting system with an integrated quinone/ferricyanide RFB. The platform system generates hydrogen from water splitting and electricity through photocatalytic charge and discharge processes of the RFB, resulting in the enhancement of the solar energy conversion efficiency.

Introduction
Artificial solar energy conversion to produce clean and sustainable fuels and electricity is promising for addressing energy and environmental issues.1–4 Solar water splitting for hydrogen fuel production hence has received much attention and different systems have been developed by scientists during the past decades.5–8 Among these systems, one-step photocatalytic water splitting is considered as a simple approach to achieve the overall water splitting reaction on a single photocatalyst.9–13 Nevertheless, the quantum efficiency is still limited, and the choice of photocatalyst is restricted by the requirement on the energy band levels, which should be thermodynamically favourable in driving both water oxidation and proton reduction. Furthermore, inspired by natural photosynthesis, artificial Z-scheme water splitting systems were developed via combining the oxygen evolution half reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution half reaction (HER) with an electron transfer mediator,14–18 thereby expanding the candidates for photocatalysts, especially visible-light-responsive materials.19–21 Moreover, the fundamental quantum efficiencies in the Z-scheme system can be improved more easily by using electron mediators suitable for the water splitting half reactions.
However, the traditional Z-scheme water splitting system bears an intrinsic limitation from the viewpoint of energy conversion and storage. Owing to the separated OER and HER on two photocatalysts, the Z-scheme system absorbs and converts twice as much solar energy to chemical energy than the one-step system. During the water splitting process, half of the photogenerated charges participate in water oxidation and photon reduction, transferring the chemical energy to the product, while the other half of the charges are used in cyclic redox reactions of the mediator, and the stored chemical energy is dissipated. Therefore, reducing or eliminating this energy dissipation is of great importance to improve the solar energy conversion performance of the Z-scheme water splitting system.
The redox flow battery (RFB) based on the transformation of two redox-active couples has been widely studied as a device to store chemical energy and produce electricity.22–25 Various redox couples utilized in the research of the RFB, such as Fe3+/Fe2+,16,26 I−/I3−,27,28 VO2+/VO2+29,30 and Fe(CN)63−/Fe(CN)64−,31–33 were also investigated as aqueous electron mediators in the Z-scheme water splitting system due to their fast redox kinetics for efficient electron transport between the photocatalysts. At this point, it is very likely to realize a rational combination of the RFB device and the Z-scheme water splitting system by sharing two redox pairs, and then make the most of their advantages for better energy storage and conversion.
Herein, we theoretically analyzed the energy loss in one-step and Z-scheme water splitting systems and then proposed a strategy of integrating a RFB into the Z-scheme water splitting system to reduce energy loss and enhance solar energy conversion. Experimentally, to verify the proof-of-concept study, we constructed a biohybrid model system by integrating a quinone/ferricyanide RFB into the photosystem II (PSII)–ZrO2/TaON Z-scheme water splitting system. According to the design, two redox couples are employed as the mediators of the water splitting half reactions, as well as the redox-active species of the RFB. After the water oxidation reaction by PSII, 2,6-dimethyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DMBQ) is reduced into 2,6-dimethyl-1,4-benzohydroquinone (DMBQH2). Along with the water reduction, ferrocyanide is oxidized into ferricyanide. As a result, the chemical energy is stored in two mediators, and then can be released as electricity by the discharge of the RFB subsequently, rather than being dissipated in the Z-scheme electron transfer process. Finally, this platform system produced both hydrogen and electricity, and the overall solar energy conversion efficiency was enhanced compared with the solar to hydrogen efficiency. This proof-of-concept work demonstrates a new strategy to achieve more efficient solar energy conversion in solar water splitting.
Results and discussion
Theoretical energy loss and solar energy conversion efficiency
The semiconductor-based photocatalytic water splitting process includes three major steps: (i) The photocatalyst harvests light to generate electron–hole pairs. (ii) Charge separation and migration occur in the bulk and on the surface of the photocatalyst. (iii) Surface reactions of proton reduction and water oxidation are carried out. The solar energy conversion efficiency (ηsolar), denoted as the ratio between the incident solar energy and the energy stored in the terminal products, is one of the key parameters to evaluate the performance of the photocatalytic water splitting system. In consideration of the three major steps involved in photocatalytic water splitting, ηsolar can be generally obtained as the multiplication of three basic factors, the light harvesting efficiency (ηLHE), the quantum efficiency (ηQE) and the energy efficiency (ηEE), as eqn (1): ηsolar = ηLHE × ηQE × ηEE(1)
The light harvesting efficiency is the percentage of the incident solar energy absorbed by the photocatalyst and stored in the excited electrons and holes. As the photogenerated charges relax to the bottom of the conduction band (CB) and the top of the valence band (VB) to participate in water splitting reactions, the absorbed photon energy equal to the bandgap actually contributes to the effective light harvesting. Therefore, the value of ηLHE is calculated according to eqn (2): (2)where Is(λ) is the standard spectrum of the solar radiation at ground level (AM 1.5G), A(λ) is the total efficiency of the photon absorption and carrier relaxation, Ebandgap is the photon energy equal to the bandgap energy of the photocatalyst, and Eabs(λ) is the energy of the absorbed photon at each wavelength.
The quantum efficiency is defined as the percentage of the photogenerated charges which ultimately participate in the redox reactions in the water splitting process. The unusable charges are dissipated via recombination in the processes of charge separation and charge utilization. The quantum efficiency can be calculated by eqn (3): ηQE = ΦCS × ΦCU(3)where ΦCS and ΦCU represent the elemental quantum efficiency of charge separation and charge utilization, respectively.
The energy efficiency is the fraction of the chemical potential energy in photogenerated charges that is stored in the terminal product hydrogen, which indicates the potential energy transfer and loss during the photocatalytic water splitting. The value of ηEE can be calculated by eqn (4): (4)where EH2 is the change of Gibbs free energy in the water splitting reaction.
These three basic factors mentioned above have their own effect on the solar energy conversion efficiency. In this work, we focus on the relationship between the energy efficiency and the solar energy conversion efficiency and find an approach to improve the energy efficiency in the photocatalytic system.
The energy loss in one-step and Z-scheme photocatalytic water splitting systems is discussed first according to thermodynamic analysis. Fig. 1a presents the process of the one-step water splitting system. Typically, the photogenerated charges of the semiconductor photocatalyst migrate to the cocatalyst, and then participate in water splitting half reactions. The light energy primarily is converted into an electrochemical potential with the energy equal to the bandgap of the semiconductor and then stored in hydrogen through a photocatalytic reaction. This process causes a potential energy loss equal to the difference between the bandgap and the Gibbs free energy of water. This kind of potential energy loss in one-step water splitting is denoted as Loss I (Loss I′ and Loss I′′ are used to differentiate the energy loss on the oxidation side and the reduction side, and it is same for Loss II discussed below). Accordingly, the energy efficiency in one-step water splitting (ηEE(one-step)) can be calculated by eqn (5): (5)
 Fig. 1  Schematic of charge transfer and potential energy loss in the one-step photocatalytic water splitting system (a) and Z-scheme photocatalytic water splitting system (b). (c) Schematic of charge transfer, potential energy loss and energy saved as electricity in a RFB-integrated Z-scheme photocatalytic water splitting system. (d) Theoretical maximal solar energy conversion efficiencies as a function of band edge absorption wavelength in the one-step water splitting system, the Z-scheme water splitting system and the RFB-integrated Z-scheme water splitting system using semiconductors with the same bandgap. The solar irradiance used for the calculation is taken from AM 1.5G data. 
Loss I can be calculated by eqn (6): ELossI = ELossI′ + ELossI′′ = Ebandgap − EH2(6)

Fig. 1b shows the Z-scheme water splitting process, in which the oxygen evolution photocatalyst (OEP) for water oxidation and the hydrogen evolution photocatalyst (HEP) for proton reduction are coupled by the electron mediator. Half of the photogenerated carriers are converted into chemical energy by water splitting and the other half are recombined via the mediator. Thus, besides Loss I similar to that in the one-step system, the Z-scheme system has another kind of energy loss (Loss II) caused by the electron transfer between two photocatalysts. Loss II gives rise to a large extra dissipation of the absorbed solar energy. The energy efficiency in the Z-scheme water splitting system (ηEE(Z-scheme)) can be calculated by eqn (7): (7)
Loss II can be calculated by eqn (8): ELossII = EbandgapI + EbandgapII − EH2 − ELossI(8)
We then calculate the theoretical maximal solar energy conversion efficiencies of the photocatalytic water splitting systems based on the viewpoints and equations above. The band edge absorption of the photocatalyst is set as a value from 300 nm to 1000 nm, indicating that the bandgap changes from ∼4.1 eV to ∼1.23 eV. Moreover, both A(λ) and ηQE are assumed to be 100%, presenting highly efficient light absorption, charge separation and forward reaction in the ideal case. The solar energy conversion efficiency for one-step water splitting (ηsolar(one-step)) as a function of wavelength is shown in Fig. S1a (ESI†), and the solar energy conversion efficiency for the Z-scheme water splitting system (ηsolar(Z-scheme)) as a function of two absorption wavelengths of photocataysts is depicted as a three-dimensional surface in Fig. S1b (ESI†). Both higher ηsolar(one-step) and ηsolar(Z-scheme) are achieved at longer absorption wavelength. However, it can be found that these ηsolar(Z-scheme) values universally lie at a lower level compared with the ηsolar(one-step) values. In consideration of the energy efficiency, the Z-scheme system absorbs more light energy using two photocatalysts for producing the same amount of hydrogen as the one-step system, thus making ηEE(Z-scheme) always lower than ηEE(one-step). In other words, although the Z-scheme water splitting system expands the feasible range of semiconductor species by relieving the requirement on the band structure, its intrinsic severe energy loss, especially Loss II which is usually higher than Loss I, significantly pulls down the solar energy conversion efficiency.
RFB-integrated Z-scheme water splitting system for enhancing energy efficiency
Based on the thermodynamic analysis of energy loss, utilization of the potential energy from Loss II is a feasible approach to enhance the solar energy conversion efficiency of the Z-scheme water splitting system. As shown in Fig. 1c, we integrate a RFB into the mediated electron transfer path of the Z-scheme water splitting system to extract energy from Loss II and produce electricity. Two redox pairs with considerable potential difference should be introduced into the integrated system to connect the water splitting system and the RFB device. Photocatalytic water splitting into H2 and O2 is matched well with photocharging of the RFB under light irradiation. Due to the production of both hydrogen and electricity, the energy efficiency in this RFB-integrated Z-scheme water splitting system (ηEE(RFB-Z-scheme)) can be calculated by eqn (9): (9)where Eelectricity presents the electric energy released by the integrated RFB. Accordingly, due to the increased energy output from electricity, ηEE(RFB-Z-scheme) becomes higher than ηEE(Z-scheme) when using the same semiconductors. By choosing mediators with redox equilibrium potentials closer to the CB of the OEP and the VB of the HEP, ηEE(RFB-Z-scheme) can be further improved.
To calculate the theoretical maximal solar energy conversion efficiency of the integrated system (ηsolar(RFB-Z-scheme)), the method and hypothesis used in one-step and Z-scheme water splitting systems above are maintained. Moreover, we propose an ideal case of the integrated system (Fig. S2, ESI†) in which each band potential is infinitely close to the redox potential of the surface chemical reaction, thus Loss I and Loss II are eliminated and ηEE(RFB-Z-scheme) can reach a maximum value of 100%. This ideal case is practically challenging and could be moved towards through rational band structure design and dynamic control. Furthermore, the discharge efficiency of the RFB, as the ratio of the released electric energy to the totally charged capacity, is a meaningful factor to evaluate the discharge performance of the RFB, and is set to be 100% here for the theoretical calculation. Therefore, it is worth noting that the ultimate maximal ηsolar(RFB-Z-scheme) based on these assumptions is a limiting value which shows the possible existence of a smaller one below it. The three-dimensional surface of maximal ηsolar(RFB-Z-scheme) is shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The change of ηsolar(RFB-Z-scheme) as a function of wavelength is in accordance with that in Z-scheme water splitting (Fig. S1b, ESI†), but the corresponding values are enhanced dramatically.
For a simple comparison of ηsolar(one-step), ηsolar(Z-scheme) and ηsolar(RFB-Z-scheme), we compare the efficiency values when the semiconductors have identical band edge absorption (Fig. 1d), in which case, the values of ηLHE in these three systems are the same, and the differences of ηsolar solely stem from different ηEE. It is found that ηsolar(Z-scheme) is only half that of ηsolar(one-step), indicating the great loss of the absorbed solar energy in the Z-scheme system. ηsolar(RFB-Z-scheme) is the highest among the three systems. This is owing to the great enhancement of ηEE(RFB-Z-scheme) at each wavelength by taking merits of both Z-scheme water splitting and the RFB. Moreover, to achieve a ηsolar value of 10% (a preliminary aim for artificial solar energy conversion proposed before),34 the semiconductor in one-step system must have a band edge wavelength longer than 520 nm, while the semiconductors in the RFB-integrated Z-scheme system only need band edge wavelengths longer than 460 nm, meaning that a wider range of semiconductors become available (see the Experimental section for more details).
The RFB-integrated Z-scheme water splitting system shows potential to improve solar energy conversion and this proof-of-concept model can guide us to design better systems for artificial photosynthesis. By separating a “one-pot” Z-scheme water splitting system into two discrete cells for water oxidation and proton reduction, H2 and O2 can be gathered separately and those mediators consumed can be utilized and regenerated in the form of the RFB. What's more, the flexible design of the RFB-integrated Z-scheme water splitting strategy can be reasonably expanded to broader solar water splitting systems, but not be limited to the semiconductor-based system.
Construction of a quinone/ferricyanide RFB-integrated PSII–ZrO2/TaON Z-scheme system
As a proof-of-concept study, we coupled two-compartment photocatalytic water splitting half reactions with a RFB device to construct the RFB-integrated Z-scheme water splitting system (Fig. 2). PSII protein was used as the OER photocatalyst and ZrO2/TaON powder was used as the HER photocatalyst. The redox pairs DMBQ/DMBQH2 and Fe(CN)63−/Fe(CN)64− functioned as both the electron mediators in Z-scheme water splitting and the redox-active species in the RFB. The integrated system began with the photocatalytic “OER-charge” and “HER-charge” processes, during which DMBQ was reduced to DMBQH2 by PSII with O2 evolution in the OER-cell, and Fe(CN)64− was oxidized to Fe(CN)63− by ZrO2/TaON with H2 evolution in the HER-cell. Subsequently, the reaction solutions with photocatalysts separated out were transferred into the RFB cell for the discharge process, with DMBQ and Fe(CN)63− being regenerated reversibly.
 Fig. 2  Schematic of the construction of the RFB-integrated Z-scheme water splitting system. Photocatalytic water splitting half reactions are conducted in two separated cells under light irradiation to produce hydrogen and oxygen, after which, the solutions containing the charged redox mediators are transferred into a RFB cell for the discharge process. 
As for the OER-charge process, Fig. 3a shows that the water oxidation rate increases gradually and reaches a plateau when the concentration of DMBQ increases to 5 mM. The time course of water oxidation in 5 mM DMBQ and the corresponding change of concentration of DMBQ and DMBQH2 are shown in Fig. 3b. ∼40 μmol O2 was produced in a reaction of four hours by adding fresh PSII to replace the inactive samples after two hours of light irradiation, during which ∼4 mM DMBQ was gradually reduced to DMBQH2 according to the UV-vis absorption of the reaction solution with the characteristic bands of DMBQ at 330 nm and DMBQH2 at 285 nm (Fig. S4a, ESI†). Accordingly, the charge efficiency, as the ratio of charges involved in DMBQ reduction to those in water oxidation, was calculated to be almost 100%.
 Fig. 3  (a) Oxygen evolution rate by PSII dependent on the concentration of DMBQ. (b) Time course of oxygen evolution by PSII and the corresponding change of concentration of DMBQ and DMBQH2; the reaction was performed with 5 mM DMBQ as the electron acceptor in 20 mL PBS buffer solution, fresh PSII slurry was added at 2 h to replace the inactive PSII. (c) Hydrogen evolution rate by PtCrOx–ZrO2/TaON dependent on the concentration of Fe(CN)64−. (d) Time course of hydrogen evolution by PtCrOx–ZrO2/TaON and the corresponding change of concentration of Fe(CN)64− and Fe(CN)63−; the reaction was performed with 10 mM Fe(CN)64− as an electron donor in 20 mL PBS buffer solution. A xenon lamp equipped with a 600 nm or 420 nm long-pass filter was used as the light source in the OER-charge or HER-charge process, respectively. The temperature was 25 °C. 
For the HER-charge process, the PtCrOx cocatalyst was photo-deposited on ZrO2/TaON for proton reduction. Fig. 3c shows that the change of the H2 evolution rate depends on the concentration of Fe(CN)64−. The maximum of the H2 evolution rate is obtained with the Fe(CN)64− concentration increasing to 10 mM. Long-term H2 evolution was performed in 10 mM Fe(CN)64−. Fig. 3d shows that H2 is produced persistently until the stoichiometric amount of 100 μmol, during which 10 mM Fe(CN)64− in the solution is gradually oxidized into Fe(CN)63− based on the UV-vis absorption of the solution with the characteristic band of Fe(CN)63− at 420 nm (Fig. S4b, ESI†). The charge efficiency in the HER-charge process was also calculated to be close to 100% (Fig. 3d).
We then investigated the independent performance of the quinone/ferricyanide RFB. In consideration of the effective combination of the RFB and water splitting reactions, the quinone/ferricyanide RFB was investigated in neutral PBS buffer (pH = 6) with 5 mM DMBQ and 10 mM Fe(CN)64− as initial anodic and cathodic species. The cyclic voltammetry results shown in Fig. 4a present a redox potential difference of ∼0.2 V between DMBQ and Fe(CN)64−. Polarization curves of the RFB shown in Fig. 4b indicate that the open-circuit potential (Voc) decreases from 0.21 V to 0.08 V with the states of charge (SOC) varying from 90% to 10%, owing to the regulation by the Nernst equation. The cyclic charge–discharge behaviour at a constant current density of 0.25 mA cm−2 with potential cut-offs of 0 V and 0.5 V reveals the stable and reproducible cycling performance of the redox couples (Fig. 4c). Discharge of the fully charged RFB at 0.25 mA cm−2 represents a battery capacity of 160 mAh L−1 and a Coulombic efficiency of 50% (Fig. 4d).

(b) Polarization curves of the RFB at different SOCs; the inset is Voc of the RFB at different SOCs. (c) Charge–discharge curves of the RFB with a constant current density of 0.25 mA cm−2, electrolyte concentrations of 5 mM DMBQ and 10 mM Fe(CN)64− and voltage cut-offs of 0 V and 0.5 V. (d) Galvanostatic discharge curve of the 100% charged quinone/ferricyanide RFB at a constant current of 0.25 mA cm−2. 
Finally, the cyclic performances of the RFB-integrated Z-scheme water splitting system were investigated. 600 nm and 420 nm long-pass filters were equipped on the solar light simulator during the OER-charge and HER-charge processes, respectively, to protect PSII and ferricyanide against serious photodamage.35–38 For efficient solar energy conversion, the water splitting-charge processes were initiated at 50% SOC for complete release of the solar energy stored in RFB, and the OER solution was renewed in each cycle to achieve sustainable water oxidation by PSII. As shown in Fig. 5a, one cycle of OER-charge is accomplished in 2 hours with the production of ∼37 μmol O2 and stoichiometric DMBQ reduction leading to the increasing of DMBQH2 from 2.5 mM to 5 mM. Similarly, in Fig. 5b, one cycle of HER-charge is accomplished in 4 hours with the production of ∼75 μmol H2 and stoichiometric Fe(CN)64− oxidation leading to the increasing of Fe(CN)63− from 5 mM to 10 mM. The different time in accomplishing one cycle of OER-charge and HER-charge processes is attributed to the different photocatalytic reaction rates of the OER and HER. Consequently, each corresponding discharge cycle releases ∼4.3 mAh electricity (Fig. 5c). Three cycles of OER-charge, HER-charge and the discharge processes exhibited good reproducibility. The Coulombic efficiencies of the three charge–discharge cycles were calculated to be about 90%.

(c) Galvanostatic discharge cycles of the photocatalytically charged quinone/ferricyanide RFB at a constant current of 0.25 mA cm−2 under dark conditions. 
All the involved reactions in this proof-of-concept study can be expressed as follows:
OER-charge: 2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e− E0 = 0.88 V(10) 2DMBQ + 4H+ + 4e− → 2DMBQH2 E0 = 0.19 V(11)
HER-charge: 2H+ + 2e− → H2 E0 = −0.35 V(12) 2Fe(CN)64− → 2Fe(CN)63− + 2e− E0 = 0.39 V(13)
Discharge: DMBQH2 → DMBQ + 2H+ + 2e− E0 = 0.19 V(14) 2Fe(CN)63− + 2e− → 2Fe(CN)64− E0 = 0.39 V(15)
The overall reactions: 2H2O → 2H2 + O2 ΔE0 = 1.23 eV mol−1(16) DMBQ + 2H+ + 2Fe(CN)64− ⇔ DMBQH2 + 2Fe(CN)63− ΔE0 = 0.2 eV mol−1(17)It is clear that the solar energy conversion in this RFB-integrated Z-scheme water splitting system is composed of two parts, solar to hydrogen and solar to electricity. Therefore, the value of ηsolar(RFB-Z-scheme) can be calculated as the sum of the solar to hydrogen efficiency (ηSTH) and the solar to electricity efficiency (ηSTE). According to the activities of hydrogen production and electricity production, ηSTH and ηSTE were calculated to be 0.12% and 0.01%, respectively, resulting in an overall solar energy conversion efficiency of 0.13%.
The schematic energy loss and electricity production by the RFB based on the related redox potentials in this hybrid system are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). We found that there is still great potential to improve ηSTE by choosing mediators with a redox potential difference larger than 0.2 V, especially one with the redox potential closer to the VB of ZrO2/TaON. The cyclic voltammetry results in Fig. S6 (ESI†) show that BQDS/BQDSH2, [SiW11O39MnII(H2O)]6−/[SiW11O39MnIII(H2O)]5− and CrIII–EDTA/CrII–EDTA39–42 possess more positive redox potentials than Fe(CN)64−/Fe(CN)63− and can be potential mediators thermodynamically. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution on PtCrOx–ZrO2/TaON with [SiW11O39MnII(H2O)]6− and BQDSH2 as electron donors was achieved initially (Fig. S7, ESI†). However, further work needs to be done to improve the kinetic performance in order to employ these candidates in successful integrated systems.
The present study has introduced an attractive approach to improve the solar energy conversion efficiency of the Z-scheme water splitting system via separating “one-pot” Z-scheme water splitting into two discrete cells connected by a RFB. This system demonstrated the initial feasibility of reducing the energy loss of the Z-scheme water splitting system and improving the solar energy conversion efficiency with the production of both solar hydrogen and solar electricity. The resulting energy output and efficiency, however, are rather low compared with the theoretical values due to the following possible reasons. Firstly, the performances of ferrocyanide oxidation and proton reduction by PtCrOx–ZrO2/TaON are not efficient, which pulls down the overall water splitting activity. As a result, ηSTH of Z-scheme water splitting is 0.12%, and photocatalytic charging to the mediators of the RFB is not fast. Secondly, the potential difference of the two mediators which indicates the open circuit voltage is quite small compared with the energy gap between PSII and ZrO2/TaON, especially the redox potential of ferrocyanide is too far from the valence band of ZrO2/TaON, leading to much energy loss. Thirdly, the concentration of mediators in the system restricts the energy density of the RFB. Much more effort needs to be devoted to enhancing the activities of the HER and OER with proper redox mediators and accelerating the electron flow between mediators and battery electrodes. The potential difference between two mediators and the power output of the RFB can be improved by regulating the redox potential to a value that is close to the corresponding energy level of photocatalysts. Surface catalytic reactions for oxidation and reduction of mediators play key roles in both the charging and discharging processes, during which low overpotentials and fast kinetics are likely to be realized by loading suitable cocatalysts. Nevertheless, the separation of the OER and HER components in the integrated system avoids the mixture of H2 and O2, and there are more opportunities to optimize the performance of the individual components. It is expected that more rational hybrid systems can be established along with developments in photocatalytic water splitting and redox flow batteries.
Conclusions
This work analyzed the solar energy conversion efficiency in photocatalytic water splitting systems from the viewpoint of the influence of energy efficiency, and proposed a RFB-integrated Z-scheme water splitting system to reduce energy loss and enhance solar energy conversion. A quinone/ferricyanide RFB was successfully integrated into the electron transfer path of a PSII–ZrO2/TaON Z-scheme water splitting system, and solar energy is converted to both hydrogen energy and electricity during the cyclic water splitting and the charge–discharge processes. Finally, a solar to hydrogen efficiency of 0.12% and a solar to electricity efficiency of 0.01% were achieved. This solar to electricity conversion contributes to the enhancement of the overall solar energy conversion. This strategy inspires the design of rational assembly of available energy devices for more efficient solar energy conversion.
Experimental
Material preparation
The PSII membrane fragments were isolated from fresh spinach as described previously,43 and then suspended in a SMN buffer (50 mM MES-NaOH, 400 mM sucrose, 15 mM NaCl, pH 6) at a concentration of 2 mg chlorophyll mL−1 and stored at −70 °C. ZrO2/TaON was synthesized as reported previously.44 Typically, Ta2O5 and ZrO(NO3)2 were mixed (Zr/Ta = 0.1 by mole) in a small amount of methanol, dried at 343 K for 1 h, and subsequently heated in air at 1073 K for 2 h to yield a ZrO2/Ta2O5 composite. ZrO2/TaON was obtained through nitridation of the as-prepared ZrO2/Ta2O5 powder at 1123 K under a flow of NH3 (20 mL min−1) for 20 h. The cocatalyst PtCrOx (mass percentage of the substrate: 1% Pt and 0.5% Cr) was loaded on ZrO2/TaON by the simultaneous photo-deposition of K2CrO4 and (NH4)2PtCl6 with methanol as an electron donor under the full-spectrum of a xenon lamp. Commercial graphite plates (2 cm × 4 cm) were ultrasonically washed in ethanol and water for 20 min each in sequence, and then heated at 500 °C for 2 h in a muffle furnace. A PBS buffer solution (100 mM phosphate, 15 mM NaCl, pH 6) was prepared for all of the photocatalytic and electrochemical tests below.
Photocatalytic reactions
For the measurements of O2 evolution by PSII and H2 evolution by PtCrOx–ZrO2/TaON, a self-made airtight vessel with a top quartz window was utilized. Before irradiation, the vessel containing the reaction solution was connected to the vacuum/inert gas line to replace the air in the headspace and solution with Ar gas, and then the vessel was put into a thermostatic water bath with the temperature kept at 25 °C for the subsequent photocatalytic reaction. A xenon lamp equipped with a 600 nm long-pass filter and a 420 nm long-pass filter was used as the light source for O2 evolution and H2 evolution, respectively. The gas produced during the reaction was monitored by injecting the headspace samples into a gas chromatograph (Agilent GC 7890, USA, 5A zeolite column and Ar carrier gas).
Electrochemical measurements
All of the electrochemical measurements were performed on a CHI 760D electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Instruments, China). Cyclic voltammetry tests of the electron shuttles were performed in a three-electrode system with a graphite plate as the working electrode, a Pt plate as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode as the reference electrode. Polarization of the RFB was measured in linear sweep voltammetry mode in a two-electrode RFB cell, which was separated by a Nafion membrane into two sub-cells, with each containing 30 mL solution of the active redox pair. Two graphite plates were used as the cathode and anode of the battery. The charge–discharge behavior of the RFB was measured in chronopotentiometry mode at a constant current density of 0.25 mA cm−2 with potential cut-offs of 0 V and 0.5 V, and the galvanostatic discharge studies were carried out at an identical current density with a potential cut-off of 0 V.
Cyclic water splitting and charge–discharge reactions
Photocatalytic OER-charge and HER-charge reactions were conducted independently in the self-made vessel with 30 mL reaction solution under an AM 1.5G solar simulator equipped with a 600 nm (for OER-charge) or 420 nm (for HER-charge) long-pass filter. The solutions after the photocatalytic reactions, with the PSII samples and the PtCrOx–ZrO2/TaON powders separated by centrifugation, were transferred into the sub-cells of the RFB for the discharge process. After discharge, the Fe(CN)63−/Fe(CN)64− solution and the PtCrOx–ZrO2/TaON precipitate were reutilized for the next cycle of the HER-charge process, while a newly prepared solution composed of fresh PSII and DMBQ/DMBQH2 pair was used for the next cycle of the OER-charge process.
Calculations of the involved efficiencies
In the calculation of the theoretical maximal solar energy conversion efficiencies, the detailed equations are given as follows:
For one-step photocatalytic water splitting, the solar energy conversion efficiency can be calculated by (18)
For Z-scheme photocatalytic water splitting, the solar conversion efficiency can be calculated by (19)where A1(λ) and A2(λ) present the total efficiencies of the photon absorption and carrier relaxation of two photocatalysts.
For the RFB-integrated Z-scheme water splitting system, the solar energy conversion efficiency can be calculated by (20)where ηdischarge presents the discharge efficiency of the RFB. In order to get the theoretical maximal solar energy conversion efficiencies in the three cases above, all of the values of ηQE, A(λ) and ηdischarge are assumed as 100%.
In the RFB-integrated PSII–ZrO2/TaON water splitting system, the solar to hydrogen efficiency (ηSTH) was calculated according to ηSTH = 100% × [ΔG0 × M(H2)]/[Pin × A × t](21)where ΔG0 is the change of Gibbs free energy for water splitting (237.14 × 103 J mol−1), M(H2) is the mole amount of hydrogen produced in the first cycle (75 μmol), Pin is the incident solar power (100 mW cm−2), A is the illumination area (7 cm2), and t is the total illumination time of the first cycle (6 h, including 2 h for the OER and 4 h for the HER).
The solar to electricity efficiency (ηSTE) was calculated according to (22)where Iout stands for the discharge current (2 mA), Vout stands for the voltage of the redox flow battery during the discharge process, and T is the discharge time.
The final solar energy conversion efficiency (ηsolar) was calculated according to (23)

Broader context
Solar fuel and solar electricity as clean and renewable energy carriers attract more and more attention from scientists to address energy and environmental issues. Artificial photosynthesis based on Z-scheme water splitting is regarded as a promising approach for solar-to-chemical energy conversion. However, the Z-scheme electron transfer pathway between two photosystems gives rise to substantial potential energy loss. Storing and converting the potential energy of the redox mediators in the electron transfer pathway is an available strategy to lower the energy loss and improve the solar energy conversion efficiency. Herein, on the basis of a theoretical understanding of the impact of the energy loss on the solar energy conversion, we proposed a strategy of integrating a redox flow battery (RFB) into the electron transfer pathway of a Z-scheme water splitting system with two redox-active species for enhancing solar energy conversion. Experimentally, we verified the proof of concept by constructing a bio-hybrid photosystem II–ZrO2/TaON Z-scheme water splitting system with an integrated quinone/ferricyanide RFB. The platform system generates hydrogen from water splitting and electricity through photocatalytic charge and discharge processes of the RFB, resulting in the enhancement of the solar energy conversion efficiency.
