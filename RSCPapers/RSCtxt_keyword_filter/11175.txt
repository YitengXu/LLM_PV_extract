    , Accepted 1st May 2018First published on 1st May 2018AbstractIn this study, thin films of composite semiconductor (SC) n-BiCdSe were electrochemically synthesized by periodic voltammetry at room temperature using an aqueous acidic bath containing the respective precursor salts. The well-adherent and uniformly deposited thin films were subjected to optical measurements (UV-vis), scanning electron microscopy (SEM-EDAX) and X-ray diffraction studies to determine the optical properties, structure and morphology of the film matrices. The polycrystalline films were composed of agglomerated particles with spherical geometry, and their size was in the range of ∼30–40 nm. A series of electrochemical techniques were employed to determine the performance output of the films with respect to their photo-electrochemical (PEC) characteristics in a liquid junction solar cell. During fabrication of the films, voltammetric cycles were optimized to obtain the best-performing composite film, which exhibited a maximum photo-conversion efficiency of 2.6% and least photocurrent decay.
1. Introduction
Since the last few decades, inherent realization of the detrimental effect of burning fossil fuels on the environment and living beings has led to the necessity for green and sustainable energy sources. Solar energy being one of the abundant sources of clean energy can be harvested in a number of ways. A photo-electrochemical cell is one of the cost-effective thin-film-based technologies having several advantages. The emerging trend of low-cost functional materials for PEC cells involves designing and formulation of multielemental Gr. II–VI and V–VI chalcogenide SC films. These intermixed matrices have a greater scope of research due to their high absorption coefficients, high efficiency in radiative recombination and well-matched optical band gaps within the visible region of the solar spectrum (1.0–3.0 eV).1,2 It is worth mentioning that the Gr. II–VI material CdSe and the Gr. V–VI material Bi2Se3 are individually used in numerous applications such as, optoelectronic and thermoelectric devices as well as in solar energy conversion systems.3–8 In fact, their potential applications in photo-electrochemical devices have been discussed in some of our earlier reports.8–10 However, it is difficult for single SC material to harvest enough energy from a wider selection of solar spectrum and fulfill all the potential requirements for a typically characterized photo-responsive material because of the inherent limitations in the respective absorption bands. A second metal or a chalcogenide element can be incorporated into a typical binary SC matrix to overcome these limitations.11,12 Santhosh et al.13 have reported the optoelectronic application of a Bi-doped CdSe matrix fabricated using a thermal evaporation technique. Several studies on mixed metal chalcogenide material thin films such as Cd(SSe),14 Bi2Te3−ySey,15 Bi2(S1−xSex)3,16 CdS/SnS,17 BiCdTe,18 (Sn2S3)x(Bi2S3)1−x,19 Bi2S3/CdS,20,21 and CdSe/PbSe22 as well as incorporation of wide-band-gap oxides as buffer layers for creating desired space charge regions in the matrix have been reported.18,23 Improved electron transfer rates and electron recombination lifetimes are also achieved with several composite structures and multilayer formulations of the chalcogenide matrices.20 These energy materials can be synthesized by various methods such as chemical bath deposition,24 arrested precipitation,25 successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction,26 electrochemical atomic layer epitaxy,27 metallo-organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD)28 and electrodeposition.29–31 Amongst the aforementioned techniques, electrodeposition is a promising method because of its simplicity, mild film-growth conditions, the possibility of large-scale production, and its intrinsic ability to control the film growth rate by adjusting the electrical parameters such as current density, scan rates, potential window and other physico-chemical parameters. To the best of our knowledge, a similar study on this specific composite SC material has not been reported so far.
Taking all the above-mentioned observations into account, the present investigation is motivated towards synthesizing composite BiCdSe nanostructured thin films on to an FTO substrate at room temperature using periodic voltammetry and evaluating PEC properties of the films, considering stability as an important criterion for a potential liquid junction solar cell. In this respect, different physico-chemical studies have been carried out to ascertain the optical properties, surface morphology, structure and composition of the films. Electrochemical characterization involves analysis of a set of data recorded using impedance spectroscopy, Tafel study and anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV). The performance output of the films was determined by current–voltage measurements under 50 mW cm−2 illumination of the deposited films.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Transparent conducting oxide (FTO, fluorine-doped SnO2)-coated glass substrates were provided by Dyesol, Australia. The TCO glass substrates were cleaned thoroughly with soap solution and then rinsed sequentially with water and acetone and finally, they were air-dried prior to deposition. AR grade reagents (E-Merck, Germany) Bi(NO3)3, Cd(NO3)2, SeO2 and Triton-X-100 (TX-100) were used in the deposition bath to obtain the semiconductor material using an aqueous acidic bath (using concentrated HNO3), and the pH of the bath was adjusted to 2.
2.2. Synthesis of BiCdSe semiconductor films
The voltammetric bath used for the deposition of BiCdSe thin films contained 0.01 M Cd(NO3)2, 0.01 M Bi(NO3)3 and 1 mM SeO2 as the precursor materials. HNO3 was used to maintain the pH of the working solution at 2, whereas 0.5% neutral surfactant TX-100 was added to increase the cohesiveness of the film that was coated onto the FTO-coated glass substrate. The BiCdSe films were electrochemically grown on a conducting glass (working electrode) at room temperature under controlled voltammetric scans ranging from 100 to 1000 cycles within the cathodic potential range of 0.0–1.0 V at a fixed scan rate of 0.4 V s−1 using AUTOLAB 12 PG Stat, Ecochemie BV (The Netherlands); an aqueous saturated calomel electrode (SCE) (W) was used as the reference electrode, and a platinum foil was used as the counter electrode. The as-deposited composite BiCdSe films were found to be grayish-brown in color, and they exhibited metallic lustre.
2.3. Spectral characterizations, morphology, structure and compositional study
The transmittance spectra of each of the as-deposited BiCdSe films and their binary counterparts Bi2Se3 and CdSe covered the range from 400 nm to 1100 nm when they were recorded using a JASCO V-530 UV-VIS-NIR spectrometer, Japan. Band gaps of the films were determined from differential transmittance plots. Surface morphology and composition of the films were determined using JEOL JSM-6700F FESEM coupled with an Oxford EDS attachment. The crystallinity of the films was studied using a Philips PW1710 X-ray diffractometer under CuKα irradiation of wavelength 1.542 Å, operating at 25 kV and 20 mA within the 2θ range from 20° to 90° at a scan rate of 0.02° s−1. The thickness of the composite films was determined using a Bruker DektakXT profilometer.
2.4. Electrochemical characterization through EIS technique
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic techniques were employed to study the Mott–Schottky (M–S) and Nyquist plots and derive the respective functional parameters such as charge-transfer resistance, carrier concentration, flat-band potential and nature of the semiconductor. The EIS records indicate the resistive and capacitive behaviours of the interface across the double-layer region. To extract the inherent property of the interface, the electrode–electrolyte combination is important. Na2Sx electrolytes, particularly in an alkaline medium, are known to have stabilizing effects on porous nanostructured photo-anodes.10,32 The measurements were carried out at room temperature in a typical 3-electrode cell assembly, i.e., FTO glass/electroplated SC film/0.5 M S2−–Sx2−/Pt with SCE (W) reference electrode using the AUTOLAB 12 electrochemistry system combined with a frequency response analyzer (FRA) module. The Nyquist plots were recorded at the respective open circuit potentials in 0.5 (M) Na2Sx electrolyte by applying a sinusoidal perturbation of 5 mV amplitude at the cell over a frequency range from 0.1 MHz to 20 mHz. Capacitance measurements were used to derive the M–S plots for the SC–electrolyte interface using a similar experimental setup with an oscillator frequency of 1 kHz and 5 mV peak-to-peak perturbation within the potential range from −0.6 to +0.6 V, whereby the nature of the semiconductor materials and donor densities could be determined.
2.5. Potentiodynamic polarization and anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV)
To investigate the stability of the films against anodic dissolution (CdSe → Cd2+ + Se + 2e− and Bi2Se3 → 2Bi3+ + 3Se + 6e−) in an aqueous environment, potentiodynamic polarization studies were performed using a similar cell setup (as discussed during film preparation) using the same AUTOLAB 12 system, and 0.1 M NaClO4 was used as the supporting electrolyte. The electrochemical polarization studies were conducted by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) within a potential window of −1.0 to 1.0 V vs. SCE (W) at a slow scan rate of 0.5 mV s−1. The Tafel plots derived from these polarization studies demonstrated important corrosion parameters such as the corrosion potential (Ecorr), corrosion current (icorr) and corrosion rate (rcorr) of each of the films.
Subsequently, voltammetric–amperometric (VA) measurements were carried out using 663 VA Trace Analyzer, Metrohm Ltd (Switzerland), which was connected with the AUTOLAB 30 electrochemistry system. The amounts of Cd2+ and Bi3+ dissolved in the working solutions were estimated by anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) following the standard addition procedure, using hanging mercury drop (drop size 0.20 mm2) electrode (HMDE) as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) as the reference electrode and a large-area glassy carbon as the counter electrode in an inert XL-grade N2-purged atmosphere.
2.6. Transient photo-response and J–V characteristics
The photo-responses of the SC films were recorded in terms of rise and decay curves under dark and illuminated (50 mW cm−2) conditions for 300 s with 20 s intervals. A three-electrode assembly, i.e., PEC cell configuration: FTO glass/electroplated SC film/0.5 M S2−–Sx2−/Pt coupled with reference SCE (W) was used to derive the current density (J)–potential (V) profiles across the anode–electrolyte interface under illumination of 50 mW cm−2 from 1 kW tungsten halogen light source.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis of BiCdSe composite films

Fig. 1 shows the typical cyclic voltammograms recorded during deposition of the film onto FTO-coated glass substrates under different periodic cycles. Nucleation is the typical characteristic of electro-deposition, and it starts on the substrate by the reduction of corresponding metal ions (Bi3+, Cd2+ and Se4+) present in the electrolytic bath within the predefined cathodic potential range (0 to −1.0 V) according to the respective redox potentials.11,18,31,33,34 This is followed by surface diffusion of the deposited atoms, which bind with each other to form thermodynamically favorable chalcogenide compounds. Finally, this process continues to form layers and thereafter, aggregation of molecular clusters takes place. The reaction sequences [eqn (1)–(7)] thus associated with the film growth process are predicted from the voltammetric features: BiO+ + 2H+ + 3e− → Bi + H2O (E0red = −0.070 V vs. SCE)(1) Cd2+ + 2e− → Cd (E0red = −0.643 V vs. SCE)(2) H2SeO3 + 4H+ + 4e− → Se + 3H2O (E0red = 0.493 V vs. SCE)(3)A clear indication of BiO+ → Bi reduction in the cathodic sweep is observed at ∼−0.1 V, and it exhibits a slight negative shift from −0.07 V, as shown [inset Fig. 1(i)] in the magnified view of the potential window. This shift is due to the surface structural changes occurring during film growth on the FTO substrate. During co-deposition, the same peak becomes broader, as shown in Fig. 1(i). The peak under the potential span of −0.50 V to −0.85 V represents the reduction of Cd2+ to Cd and the consequent CdSe formation. However, broadening of the peak during co-deposition also indicates the composite film formation, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1(ii). The nucleated elements on the surface diffuse to form Bi2Se3 and CdSe compounds [eqn (4) and (5)] due to their thermodynamically favourable Gibbs free energy of formation:35,36 2Bi + 3Se → Bi2Se3 (ΔG = −140.0 kJ mol−1)(4) Cd + Se → CdSe (ΔG = −100.4 kJ mol−1)(5)The parallel reactions associated with the reduction process ultimately converge to the Bi and Cd chalcogenide formations30,37 [eqn (6) and (7)]: 2BiO+ + 3Se + 4H+ + 6e− → Bi2Se3↓ + 2H2O (E0red = −0.12 to −0.25 V vs. SCE)(6) Cd2+ + H2SeO3 + 4H+ + 6e− → CdSe↓ + 3H2O (E0red = −0.65 to −0.80 V vs. SCE)(7)With a further decrease in the cathodic potential beyond −0.8 V, the curve declines and the sharp decrease in the cathodic current is ascribed to the H2 evolution under the aqueous acidic (pH = 2) condition.

The reverse anodic sweep characterized by a large hump corresponds to the oxidation of the elements Bi and Cd at ∼−0.60 V, and it essentially represents Cd and Bi oxide formation along with partial stripping of the elements from the matrix. Thus, under periodic voltammetric conditions, there is continuous formation and depletion of the composite matrix, which ultimately leads to the formation of a composite admixture of tightly coupled binary chalcogenides with clear inclusion of individual oxides into the matrix to certain levels.
3.2. Spectral characterizations, morphology, structure and compositional study

Fig. 2 shows the typical transmission spectra of the binary and composite films deposited onto the FTO-coated glass substrate. All the transmittance spectra are shown in ESI,† Fig. S1. The inset of Fig. 2 shows the derivative plots (dT/dλ vs. λ) exhibiting a sharp absorption edge around 657 nm, which corresponds to a band gap of 1.88 eV for the composite BiCdSe obtained under 500 cycles, and this indicates the co-existence of Bi2Se3 and elemental Bi in the matrix. The band gaps of the co-deposited BiCdSe films are found to be in the range from 1.85 to 1.88 eV. The formation of a metal oxide CdO is also evidenced from the band edge at 558 nm corresponding to 2.22 eV. The impurities in the form of oxides enrich the SC matrix with intermixed band gaps, creating extra band edges, which are effective toward increasing the absorption range, minimizing band bending and thus propagating facile charge transfer kinetics during the PEC operation.

It is observed that with a gradual increase in the deposition cycle, the thickness of the films increases. The thickness profiles for all the compositions of the BiCdSe composite films are shown in ESI,† Fig. S2.
Typical SEM images and EDX patterns of the BiCdSe composite films (500 cycles) are presented in Fig. 3a and b, respectively. The SEM images of the films developed under 250 and 750 cycles are also shown in the ESI† (Fig. S3). The SEM micrograph reveals homogeneous and compact nanocrystalline structure, where the particles coalesce to form self-designed cauliflower geometry. The average size of the agglomerated NPs is found to be in the range of 30–40 nm, as observed from the SEM analysis.

The composition of the film matrices is obtained from the EDX analysis, and the composite film is found to be enriched with Bi since the electrodeposition rate of Bi is much higher than that of other co-elements. The formation of certain metal oxides with the increasing deposition cycles is evident from the XRD and UV spectroscopic results. Elemental mapping is carried out for the composite films, and the typical pattern for BiCdSe (500 cycles) film is shown in Fig. 3c, which confirms the distinct existence of all the three elements along with their oxides in the composite matrix. It is also revealed that the matrix is rich in Bi and Se rather than Cd, which is also observed from the corresponding EDX pattern (Fig. 3b).
XRD patterns recorded for Bi2Se3, CdSe and BiCdSe films under 500-cycle depth are shown in Fig. 4a, whereas those for the rest of the composite films developed under variable cycle depths are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). All the synthesized films show a polycrystalline nature. The individual peaks are indexed using the JCPDS database [JCPDS file # 19-0191, 77-2307, 77-2016, 44-1246, 41-1449, 74-1633, 05-0640, 38-0768]. The peaks for the BiCdSe (500 cycles) composite film confirm the formation of an intermixed Bi2Se3–CdSe composite matrix showing individual Bi2Se3 and CdSe phases. Fig. 4a′ shows the amplified view of the XRD pattern in the 2θ region of 23°–26°. The (111) facet at 25.4°and (220) facet at 42.1° confirm the cubic CdSe phases, whereas the (100) facet at 23.86°and (002) facet at 25.6° signify hexagonal CdSe phases in the matrix. Orthorhombic Bi2Se3 formation can be confirmed from the most intense peak at 27.2° (211) and other peaks at 39.66° (510) and 48.77° (260). The formation of cubic Bi2O3 is also noticed from the diffraction pattern at around 56.20° (222), whereas cubic CdO formation can be ascertained by 2θ = 56.07° (220), 33.69° (111) and 65.58° (311). Furthermore, some weak peaks at 78.31° (211) and 70.86° (210) confirm the presence of elemental cubic Se, and the peaks at 39.6° (110), 44.57° (015) and 46.00° (113) confirm the presence of elemental rhombohedral Bi in the composite films and in Bi2Se3(500) as well. The formation of metal oxides in the SC matrix is also evidenced from the UV spectroscopic measurements shown in Fig. 2.

By considering the most intense diffraction peak [27.2° (211)] of Bi2Se3, the average crystallite sizes (D) of the corresponding films were determined using the well-known Debye Scherrer equation,38 and they were found to be in the range of 4–24 nm for composite BiCdSe films. CdSe developed under 500 periodic scans exhibited a crystallite size of 10 nm taking the intense 25.4° (111) peak into consideration, whereas the Bi2Se3 films developed under the same scan showed a crystallite size of 25 nm using an indexed intense peak at 27.2° (211). The crystallite size tended to increase with the depth of periodic cycles and was observed to attain a grain size of ∼22 nm under 500 cycles. The size quenching of BiCdSe (500) crystallites was due to the incorporation of Cd into the composite matrix, as observed from the EDX studies (Fig. 3b), where a gradual increase in Cd at% was evident with the increasing cycles. Dislocation densities (δ) and lattice strains (ε) were also calculated from the evaluated data of crystallite sizes using the following equations,39 where D is the crystallite size and β is FWHM for a particular 2θ value obtained from the XRD patterns: (8) (9)Fig. 4b shows the δ and ε profiles of the SC films. The binary CdSe and Bi2Se3 films (500 cycles) are found to exhibit the least dislocation densities and lattice strains, and they also show better crystallinities and stoichiometric structures. Interestingly, the BiCdSe films deposited at lower periodic cycles (250) show significantly higher values of dislocation density and lattice strain, whereas under 500 cycles and beyond, the strain factor is very low. This in fact suggests the formation of a crystal lattice with less defects as the grain size is increased for the matrices developed under moderate to high periodic scans (>500).
3.3. Electrochemical characterization through EIS technique
The capacitance–voltage measurements are used to derive the essential Mott–Schottky parameters such as flat band potential (Vfb) and carrier density (ND) using the M–S relation CSC−2 = (V − Vfb − kBTe−1)2(ε0εSNDe)−1,40,41 where V and Vfb are the electrode potential and flat band potential, respectively, ε0 and εS are the permittivities in vacuum and in SC compound, respectively, e is the electronic charge, T is the operating temperature (298 K), kB is the Boltzmann's constant and CSC is the space charge capacitance of the SC film. Fig. 5a shows the M–S plots where the n-type nature of the BiCdSe films is confirmed from the positive slope of the plots. The amplified view of M–S in the potential region of −0.4 to 0.0 V is shown in Fig. 5b. The slope of the linear region of the plots is used to calculate the ND values, whereas Vfb values are obtained from the intercepts. Typically, a flat-band potential represents the external applied voltage required to restrict the band bending or charge depletion during illumination of the SC material when a potential difference exists between the potential of fermi-level and the electrolyte redox potential.42 The evaluated M–S parameters are shown in the ESI,† Table S1. Interestingly, amongst all the composites, the BiCdSe film produced under 500 cycles possesses the most negative Vfb (−0.514 V), indicating the least activation potential required for the charge transfer kinetics at the SC–electrolyte interface.43 The calculated ND values are displayed in Fig. 5c. The ND values for all the composite films are found to be much higher than that for the binary CdSe (500) film; this is due to composite formation with Bi2Se3 (500 cycle), which shows a ∼20-fold increase (4.56 × 1020 cm−3) in the ND values compared to CdSe (500) films (2.08 × 1019 cm−3). A remarkably high value of ND (2.11 × 1022 cm−3) is obtained for the BiCdSe (500) film. With further cycle loading (>500), ND decreases due to the formation of oxide-rich porous matrices. The feasibility of the charge transfer process across the SC–redox electrolyte interface is further revealed through EIS measurements of different BiCdSe films. The semicircular nature of the Nyquist plots (Fig. 5d) is due to the resistance to the charge transfer at the interfacial region.
 Fig. 5  EIS records in 0.5 M S2−–Sx2− electrolyte: (a) Mott–Schottky plots for the synthesized films, (b) magnified view in the selected region (c) ND and Rct profiles for the films and (d) respective Nyquist plots with the equivalent circuit diagram in the inset. 
The impedance records were analyzed considering the Randles equivalent circuit (EC) model (inset Fig. 5d), which includes important functional parameters such as solution resistance (Rs), charge transfer resistance (Rct) and double-layered capacitance representing the constant phase element (CPE) associated with the charge transfer process.44 Typically, on the one hand, an SC material with low Rct and moderate CPE values is desirable for transporting charges through carriers and on the other hand, it is desirable for the storage of charges to an optimal level in the space charge region.45 The EIS parameters of the SC film prepared under different periodic cycles are demonstrated in ESI,† Table S1. The film deposited under 500 periodic cycles was found to exhibit a significantly low Rct value (145 Ω), as shown in Fig. 5c and in contrast, it exhibited a moderately high value of CPE when compared with the other films obtained under variable voltammetric scans. The roller-coaster behavior of the ND profile replicates that of the inverse Rct pattern, indicating facilitated charge transfer with maximized carrier concentration.
3.4. Potentiodynamic polarization and anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV)
The potentiodynamic polarization studies of the films in aqueous medium produced the corresponding Tafel plots (Fig. 6a), and the electrochemical stability was ascertained by evaluating the corrosion current (icorr) and corrosion potential (Ecorr) of the SC matrices.46 Subsequently, the corrosion rates (rcorr) were determined in terms of the extent of mass loss in kg cm−2 s−1 (w/t) using the Faraday's law.47 The corrosion parameters are summarized in ESI,† Table S2 and the variations in Ecorr and rcorr for the films are presented in a bar diagram in Fig. 6b. On the basis of rcorr values, it may be predicted that the composite BiCdSe films acquired appreciable stability compared to Bi2Se3 deposited under 500 cycles. Fig. 4b demonstrates lower dislocation densities and lattice strains for composite BiCdSe deposited under 500 cycles and beyond due to a gradual increment in the size of NPs. This phenomenon may sound contradicting with the observed decreasing trend for the stability of the films at higher deposition cycles (>500 cycles). It should be understood that the strain factor may not play a vital role for the stability of the Bi2Se3 films; rather, at higher cycles (>500 cycles), the matrix is enriched with elemental Bi and Se, but the films gradually lose their adherence property as well and become more susceptible to corrosion in an aqueous environment. At the same time, the Bi-oxide/hydroxide formation makes the film passive, as was identified by the trans-passive region in the anodic branch of the Tafel plots obtained under polarized conditions for higher periodic scans (>500 cycles). Although the CdSe film exhibited the least rcorr value (0.74 × 10−12 kg cm−2 s−1) amongst all the films under study, there was almost a 10-fold (1.85 × 10−11 kg cm−2 s−1) decrease in the corrosion rate (rcorr) observed for the best composite film (500 cycle) compared to that for pure Bi2Se3 (1.26 × 10−10 kg cm−2 s−1). Therefore, the corrosion inhibition may be ascribed to the optimum blending of CdSe NPs with Bi2Se3 NPs, which produced an admixture of the two compound SCs, where excess Bi was present in the elemental or oxide phases.

Moreover, under sustained polarized conditions of the films, Cd2+ and Bi3+ leached out of the matrices, and their concentrations were estimated by the ASV analysis.48 Typical anodic stripping voltammograms of Cd2+ and Bi3+ for the BiCdSe films are shown in Fig. 7a and b, respectively, with the corresponding current–concentration profiles in the insets. The estimated concentrations of Cd2+ and Bi3+ stripped off the matrices of BiCdSe composite films (Fig. 8) appeared to be almost invariant for low (100 and 250) periodic scans till 500 scans, and the Cd2+ stripping nearly matched with that obtained for the CdSe (500) film. Thereafter, profuse leaching of Cd2+ and Bi3+ was observed up to 1000 periodic scans. The Bi3+ dissolution for 1000 cycles attained almost comparable results to those for the binary Bi2Se3 film (500 cycles). This may be rationalized by the fact that BiCdSe deposited under lower periodic cycles up to 500 acquires stability, and Cd2+ and Bi3+ leaching becomes less prominent due to the formulation of tightly coupled mixed chalcogenide structures.

3.5. 
          J–V characteristics and photo-response study
The power output characteristics of the films were determined in a typical PEC cell as mentioned earlier, and they are demonstrated in Fig. 9a with simultaneous recording of open circuit potentials (Voc) and short-circuit currents (Jsc). The efficiency (%) [η = (J × V)max/power input] and fill factor (%) [FF = (J × V)max/Voc × Jsc] were derived from the power density curves and are shown in Fig. 9b. The bar diagram (Fig. 9c) represents a comparative profile of the solar cell parameters. All the J–V parameters are summarized in the ESI,† Table S3. Binary CdSe films developed under 500 cycles showed a solar conversion efficiency of 0.36% with a fill factor of 16.88%, whereas for Bi2Se3, which is a superior photoactive material, the efficiency increased to 1.24%, but the fill factor decreased to 13.81%. However, much improvement was observed with the composite BiCdSe (500) film, and the PEC characteristics increased to 2.57% (η) and 32.98% (FF) with a Jsc value of 5.58 mA cm−2 representing the highest current output produced by the composite SC film. Further scans beyond 500 cycles reduced the photo-conversion efficiency, which drastically decreased in the case of composite BiCdSe (1000) films; this was due to the formation of more oxides in the film matrix and prolonged exposure to acidic deposition condition, due to which the film lost its adherence properties and degraded. These results were in agreement with the carrier concentrations and interfacial charge transfer resistance obtained for the SC films shown in Fig. 5c.

The transient photo-response of the BiCdSe (500) thin films recorded under successive dark and illuminated conditions for 300 s is shown in Fig. 9d. The films developed under low periodic scans (<500 cycles) exhibit poor photosensitivity, which is almost comparable to that obtained with pure CdSe films (500). The photo-sensitivity is remarkably improved after the film formation under 500-cycle depth, and it is at par with that obtained for Bi2Se3 grown under similar conditions. All these observations lead to the confirmation of the BiCdSe film grown under 500-cycle depth as the most efficient semiconductor film under study with promising energy conversion and appreciable inherent stability.
4. Conclusion
Controlled periodic voltammetry can be an effective electrochemical route for developing n-BiCdSe films with potential functional properties for liquid junction solar cells. The optical and electrochemical characterizations of the films revealed that the depth of periodic cycles exerts a definite influence on the growth of the energy-efficient film matrix with blended multi-elemental NPs, constituting a composite formulation of the compound semiconductors. Among the different films, a sequential scan of 500 cycles was considered as the most effective condition for depositing the best BiCdSe film produced in this study, and this film exhibited reasonably good photo-response, appreciable photoconversion efficiency (η = 2.6%) and an adequate fill factor of 32.98%. Moreover, this particular film showed substantially low charge transfer resistance and moderately high capacitance, which in turn helped improve the charge transfer kinetics across the SC–electrolyte interface, as manifested by short-circuit current output records.
