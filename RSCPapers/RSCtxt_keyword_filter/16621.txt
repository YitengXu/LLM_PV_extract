, Accepted 6th January 2014First published on 7th January 2014AbstractWe demonstrate that the morphology of ZnO buffer layers for the inverted organic solar cells (IOSC) was improved by controlling the molecular interaction in solvents to disperse ZnO nanoparticles (NPs). Dispersion of ZnO NPs in non-polar solvent usually resulted in turbid or semi-transparent solution. In this study, uniform dispersion of ZnO NPs was achieved through applying mixed solvents composed of both non-polar and polar solvents without the assistance of an organic surfactant. From the analysis based on Hansen solubility parameter theory, the improvement was mainly associated with hydrogen bonding interactions between the two component of solvents. Smooth ZnO buffer layers were deposited using the colloidal solution based on the binary solvent mixture and the photovoltaic performance of the IOSC was highly improved by optimizing solvent mixtures.
1. Introduction
Polymer-based bulk heteojunction (BHJ) solar cells composed of electron donating polymer and electron accepting fullerene have attracted a lot of interest as candidates for a low cost source of clean and renewable energy.1 In polymer solar cells, a strongly bound electron–hole pair, or exciton, is generated and should be dissociated to form free carriers for charge collection. The dissociated free carriers transported to collecting electrodes and good ohmic contacts between electrodes and photoactive BHJ layers are required. To achieve good ohmic contacts, charge extracting interlayers or buffer layers have been inserted. ZnO is one of the most popularly used buffer layers for electron transport due to its stability against environmental attack, high optical transparency and facile synthesis route.2,3 In addition, the large ionization potential of ZnO blocks transport of holes and thus increases the shunt resistance of the device.
Various routes including sol–gel deposition,3 atomic layer deposition4 were developed for depositing ZnO buffer layers for electron transport and ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) were proven to be highly useful for deposition of ZnO buffer layers.3 ZnO NPs were simply synthesized from zinc acetate dihydrate (ZnOAc) with addition of strong bases dissolved in methanol5 and spin-coated onto bottom electrodes to form buffer layers at low temperature.6 Large scale aggregated morphology in organic solar cells usually limits the power conversion efficiency (PCE).7 The morphological change of ZnO buffer layers in inverted organic solar cells (IOSC) provides a large influence on their photovoltaic performance.8 In particular, the surface roughness of ZnO buffer layer can affect the photovoltaic performance of IOSCs by changing the effective interfacial area between the active layer and the ZnO buffer layer.9 In order to prepared ZnO buffer layers for highly efficient organic solar cells, homogeneous colloidal solution of ZnO NPs without aggregation are required.9
In order to prepare solution for further deposition process, ZnO NPs were dispersed in non-polar solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, etc.6,10,11 In particular, addition of surfactant such as n-propylamine,8 silane coupling agent12 are popularly required for uniform dispersion of ZnO NPs. However, significant loss of electron transport is expected through insulating surfactant interface.7 In the absence of surfactant, a small amount of alcohol was usually added to non-polar solvent for effective dispersion of nano-sized ZnO.8,11 In this study, we demonstrate that addition of alcohol can remarkably improve dispersion of ZnO NPs in non-polar solvents by modifying hydrogen bonding interaction of solvents. It was shown that both morphology of ZnO buffer layers and the subsequent photovoltaic performance of the IOSCs having blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the active layer were improved using nearly transparent colloidal solution of ZnO NPs.
2. Results and discussions
2.1. Identification of surface species on ZnO nanoparticles
Fig. 1 shows Raman spectra of ZnO nanoparticles synthesized from ZnOAc. Raman spectra of ZnO bulk powders were also presented for comparison. In addition to peaks from ZnO itself, several Raman scattering peaks from different origin were detected. Most of extra peaks were assigned to be vibration of acetate group (CH3COO–) and a broad peak at near 3500 cm−1 was assigned to be vibration of stretching mode of hydroxyl group (–OH).13,14 Oxygen in acetate ions bonds with surface Zn atoms to form bridge structures as revealed from the difference in the Raman shift between symmetric (νs) and anti-symmetric (νas) stretching vibration mode of acetate groups.14 Since dispersion of NPs in solvent is usually dominated by interaction between surface ligands and solvents, the acetate group and hydroxyl groups covered the surface of ZnO NPs are expected to pose dispersion in a specific solvent.15

2.2. Solubility parameters and dispersion of ZnO nanoparticles
The effect of solvent–solvent and solvent–solute interaction on the morphology of ZnO thin films and the photovoltaic properties of IOSC using ZnO NPs as a buffer layer were evaluated using mixed solvent comprising non-polar and polar solvent. Isopropyl alcohol (IPA) was used as a polar solvent and chlorobenzene (CB) was used as a non-polar solvent for ZnO NPs. Hansen solubility parameters (HSP) theory have offered useful methods to understand and to investigate dispersion or solubility of pigments and polymers.16 Here, the total solubility parameter (δT) is defined as the square root of the cohesive energy density (E/V) which is the energy required to infinitely separate a unit volume of a given species from the other component. The total solubility parameters can be defined as a square root of the squared sum of the individual HSPs which are comprised of the dispersive (δD), the polar (δP) and the hydrogen bonding (δH) solubility parameters. The dispersion of NPs in a certain solvent can be described by the position in 3-dimensional space using the three HSPs of each components in the solvent system as Cartesian coordinates. In this formalism, the NPs and the solvents can be represented by coordinates in HSP space. The dispersion of NPs in solvents define the interaction radius (Ro) which designates the radius of the sphere in HSP space indicating maximum tolerance of the solution. For a specific solvent distance between NPs and solvent in HSP space (Ra) is defined as eqn (1): 
Ra2 = 4(δD1 − δD2)2 + (δP1 − δP2)2 + (δH1 − δH2)2
(1)where subscripts 1 and 2 represent the solute and the solvent. Then, the relative energy difference (RED = Ra/Ro) provides evaluation of dispersibility of the NPs in various solvents. That is, for a solvent, NPs will be dispersed when RED < 1 and non-dispersible when RED > 1. The HSPs of ZnO NPs were determined by solvent screening through associating the solubility parameters of the solute with the most successful solvents using HSPiP, a software developed by S. Abbott and H. Yamamoto based on HSP theory.15–17 Here, good solvent which form homogeneous colloidal solution with ZnO NPs at concentration of more than 1 mg ml−1 was assigned to be “1” and poor solvent was assigned to be “0” (detailed description on the determination of HSPs of ZnO NPs will be found in ESI†). The HSPs of ZnO NPs were calculated to be δD = 17.25 MPa1/2, δP = 6.75 MPa1/2 and δH = 10.83 MPa1/2 with the interaction radius of Ro = 6.7 MPa1/2 as shown in Fig. 2(a). The solubility parameters of mixtures are linear,16 and each of the three HSPs of the mixed solvent system based on IPA-CB is a linear function of volume fraction for each solvent species. That is, the HSPs of co-solvent were calculated using following eqn (2): 
(2)where ϕi stands for the volumetric fraction of solvent species. Then, the variation of HSPs in CB-IPA system as a function of volumetric fraction of IPA (ϕ(IPA)) is represented as a straight line in HSP space as shown in Fig. 2(a). As mentioned earlier, the relative energy difference (Ra), a distance from solvent to ZnO NPs in HSP space provides a measure of immiscibility for each components in the solution and is defined by square root of squared sum of difference in HSPs between two components. Contribution of each components in HSPs between two components to their immiscibility can be represented by difference in HSPs of two components. The difference in HSPs between ZnO NPs and mixed solvents was examined to measure the contribution of HSPs to dispersion in mixed solvent system as depicted in Fig. 2(b). The deviation of dispersion parameters (δD) and polar solubility parameters (δP) is quite small throughout various solvent composition and their contribution to improved dispersion of ZnO NPs can be considered to be trivial. In contrast, the difference in hydrogen bonding solubility parameter (δH) is largely diminished by increasing volume fraction of IPA up to ca. ϕ(IPA) = 0.6 and increased by further incorporation of IPA. From this variation of solubility parameters of the mixed solvent system having various volumetric fraction of IPA, the drastic change in δH can be attributed to be a dominant contribution to dispersion of ZnO NPs.

Here, the difference in dispersion solubility parameters (δD) was doubled by considering its contribution to Ra; (c) variation of the relative energy difference (RED) and optical density of the colloidal ZnO NPs solution measured at λ = 400 nm as function of the volume fraction of CB in co-solvent system. Inset graph displays a linear correlation between RED and aggregation; (d) photographs of colloidal solution of ZnO nanoparticles dispersed in various composition of mixed solvent in CB-IPA system. 
The REDs of mixed solvent with respect to ZnO NPs were calculated as a function of volume fraction of IPA. Here, the degree of aggregation of ZnO NPs in solvent was depicted from the optical absorption coefficient at λ = 400 nm at which no absorption is expected for fully dispersed ZnO NPs having band gap of 3.8 eV which corresponds to 330 nm in wavelength. Fig. 2(c) shows both variation of RED and optical absorption at 400 nm for ZnO NPs dispersed in co-solvent having a variety of CB content. It shows a meaningful linear correlation between RED and aggregation of NPs as discussed above. The RED between pure IPA and ZnO NPs is slightly less than 1 which is at the spherical boundary of solubility for ZnO NPs in HSP space. Then, further improvement or deterioration in dispersion of ZnO NPs in solvent is expected due to modifying the composition of solvent. As confirmed from experimental results, CB is a poor solvent for dispersion of ZnO NPs and the calculated RED between CB and ZnO NPs is 1.64. Here, incorporating IPA to CB improved the dispersion of ZnO NPs in solvent as shown from the transparency of colloidal ZnO solution presented in Fig. 2(d) by changing the RED from 1.53 (ϕ(IPA) = 0) to 0.26 (ϕ(IPA) = 0.6) due to modification of hydrogen bonding interaction in solvents.
2.3. Surface roughness and morphology of ZnO layers
In this study, the colloidal solution of ZnO NPs dispersed in solvent having different composition (ϕ(IPA) = 0, 0.6, 1) were casted on ITO substrates to form buffer layers for application to IOSC. Here, solvent as expected from HSP theory, solvent composition having lowest RED (ϕ(IPA) = 0.6) in CB-IPA for dispersion of ZnO NPs was selected as a composition of mixed solvent. Fig. 3(a) shows the optical microscopic images of ZnO buffer layers deposited from colloidal solution of ZnO NPs dispersed in pure and mixed solvent. ZnO layer deposited from ZnO NPs dispersed in pure CB (ϕ(IPA) = 0) showed large agglomerates having highly inhomogeneous microstructure. The large agglomerates having a few μm in size were also observed from ZnO layer deposited from IPA-based colloidal solution (ϕ(IPA) = 1). Thus, ZnO layer deposited from pure solvent-based colloidal solution of ZnO NPs contains micrometer-sized agglomerates on the surface. Since CB is a “poor” solvent having large RED (∼1.53) for dispersion of ZnO NPs, the significant phase separation or agglomeration of ZnO NPs after deposition on the substrate is expected as shown in the optical microscopic image. IPA is classified as a “good” solvent, the RED of IPA is at near the spherical boundary (RED ∼ 1.0) for dispersion of ZnO NPs in HSP coordinates (see Table S1 in ESI†). Then, slight agglomeration of ZnO NPs in IPA is expected as inferred from the semi-transparency of colloidal solution based on IPA shown in Fig. 2(d).

Here, the scale bar indicates 10 μm. (c) The root-mean-squared roughness (Rq) from AFM scanned in two different scales (2 μm × 2 μm; 5 μm × 5 μm). 
In contrast, ZnO NPs dispersed in mixed solvent (ϕ(IPA) = 0.6) having smallest RED for dispersion of ZnO NPs can deposit highly uniform oxide layer without any macro-scale agglomerates. In particular, the surface roughness and topography of the same films were investigated with atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 3(b), uniform ZnO films composed of small grains were observed and the root-mean-square roughness (Rq) values are minimized by applying mixed solvent as shown in Fig. 3(c). In particular, surface roughness was decreased from 6.0 nm to 1.9 nm for ZnO films by incorporating IPA to CB for solvent. Compared with the roughness of ITO substrate (Rq = 3.3 nm) used in this study, smooth surface was obtained from ZnO NPs dispersed in IPA-containing solvents.
2.4. The photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells using ZnO buffer layers
Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of IOSC incorporating ZnO films deposited from colloidal solution having different composition under AM 1.5G irradiation with intensity of 100 mW cm−2 and in dark are shown in Fig. 4 and Table 1 summarizes the data. The ZnO buffer layers of sample devices denoted by “A” and “C” have been prepared by colloidal solution using pure CB and IPA as solvent for nanoparticle dispersion. In addition, the buffer layer for device denoted by “B” was prepared using mixed solvent as dispersing media for ZnO NPs. The photovoltaic performance of devices were remarkably improved using mixed solvent to prepare colloidal solution for ZnO deposition. In particular, the fill factor (FF) of the device from CB-based solution was exceptionally changed by incorporating IPA into colloidal solution. It is known that series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) are important factors that limit the FF of solar cells.18–24 Taking Rs, Rsh, Voc of devices into consideration, FF can be described by following equation:25–27

Here, FFs is the fill factor having only Rs, νoc is the open circuit voltage divided by nkBT/q, rs and rsh are the actual resistances (Rs, Rsh) divided by Voc/Jsc. Fig. 4(b) depicted Voc–FF curve calculated from eqn (3) based on derived device parameters listed in Table 1. Comparison of experimental and calculated FF suggests that the variation of FF for different devices was efficiently reconstructed with eqn (3) and change in resistances are mainly responsible for variation in FF. As can be seen from eqn (3), the small Rs and the large Rsh can improve FF. For devices prepared in this study, variation of resistance from bulk component such as active layer, electrodes can be neglected and change in interfacial resistance between active layer and electrodes should be considered. Devices using ZnO buffer layers deposited from colloidal solution based on pure solvents showed relatively large Rs and resultant small FF. The origin of large Rs can be attributed to interfacial characteristics of the samples. As mentioned earlier, ZnO buffer layers prepared by pure solvent contain large aggregates resulting in rough surfaces. The rough surface can increase interfacial area between buffer layer and active layer. Since ZnO NPs contain large concentration of surface defects, the large interfacial area from rough interface contains large amount of interfacial traps which may induce trap-assisted recombination.9,28 The trap-assisted recombination can increase electric field dependence of photocurrent or serial resistance. In addition to this, the low fill factor in device “A” can also be attributed to significant variation of ZnO layer thickness due to agglomeration of ZnO NPs. The photovoltaic performance including fill factor of organic solar cells can be varied by changing thickness of ZnO buffer layers.29 Then, the improvement in FF of device “B” can be attributed to smooth surface of ZnO buffer layer induced by uniform dispersion of ZnO NPs in mixed solvent. The enhanced Voc of device “B” can also be attributed to decrease in interfacial trap density by formation of smooth interface with active layers, since non-radiative recombination at interfacial trap limits Voc.9 Hence, it was shown that smooth surface of ZnO buffer layers prepared by uniformly dispersed ZnO NPs in mixed solvent enhanced the photovoltaic performance of IOSC devices.
In order to test the feasibility of HSPs for dispsersion of ZnO NPs, we develop new solvent systems based on various combination of different solvents. Table 2 lists photovoltaic performance of IOSC using ZnO NPs dispersed in various combination of solvents having optimal composition as expected in HSP theory. Chloroform which was classified as “good” solvent showed highly improved dispersion of ZnO NPs in mixing with methanol, a “bad” solvent.30 The HSPs of the mixed solvent with optimized composition was calculated to be δD = 16.8 MPa1/2, δP = 5.9 MPa1/2 and δH = 10.7 MPa1/2 with RED = 0.22 for ZnO NPs. In addition, although both toluene and methanol were proved to be “poor” solvents for dispersion of ZnO NPs (see Table S1 in ESI†), mixture of the two components with appropriate ratio resulted in highly uniform colloidal solution of ZnO NPs. Highly transparent solutions of ZnO NPs were prepared with mixed solvent as expected from HSP theory and IOSC devices having highly improved photovoltaic performance were prepared with ZnO buffers prepared from colloidal solutions based on mixed solvents.

3. Summary
In summary, we prepared colloidal solutions of uniformly dispersed ZnO nanoparticles by modifying hydrogen bonding interaction in solvent through mixing with different co-solvent. The morphology of ZnO buffer layers were highly improved by modification of solvent and the photovoltaic performance of the inverted organic solar cells (IOSC) using ZnO buffer layers were improved as a result of improved surface morphology of ZnO buffer layers. In this study, uniform dispersion of ZnO NPs were achieved through applying mixed solvents composed of both non-polar and polar solvents. From the analysis based on Hansen solubility parameter theory, these improvement was mainly associated with hydrogen bonding interactions between the two component of solvents. Smooth ZnO buffer layers were deposited using the colloidal solution based on binary solvent mixture and the photovoltaic performance of the IOSC was highly improved by optimizing solvent mixtures.
4. Experimental section
4.1. Synthesis
ZnO NPs were simply synthesized from zinc acetate dihydrate (ZnOAc) with addition of strong bases dissolved in methanol.5 1 mmol of ZnOAc was dissoved in 60 ml of methanol and base solution was prepared by dissolving 1 mmol of KOH in 65 ml methanol. The KOH solution was dropped to ZnOAc solution using syringe pump with rate of 6 ml min−1 at 60 °C. The solution mixture was further reacted for 2 hours at the same temperature and ZnO NPs were precipitated by centrifugation after cooling to room temperature. The precipitated ZnO NPs were re-dispersed in methanol and centrifuged again. This cycle was repeated for 3 times and Finally, the precipitates were dried under vacuum at room temperature to remove residual methanol. Finally, the ZnO NPs were dispersed in solvent based on chlorobenzene and isopropyl alcohol having various volumetric ratio of each component.
4.2. Characterization
The shape and the crystal structure of grown NPs were checked with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on a JEOL 2100F and powder X-ray diffraction with Rigaku X3B, respectively. The optical absorption spectra and Raman spectra of ZnO NPs were obtained with UV-VIS spectrometer (Cary 5000).
4.3. Preparation of photovoltaic devices
P3HT:PCBM solution was prepared by dissolving P3HT and PCBM to ODCB at concentration of 30 mg ml−1 and 24 mg ml−1, respectively. The typical procedure used to prepare the photovoltaic devices was as follows: indium tin oxide (ITO) glass was cleaned by successive ultrasonification with acetone, ethanol and DI water for 30 min, respectively. Then, the ZnO NPs dispersed in co-solvent based on CB-IPA was spin coated on ITO substrates followed by drying at 150 °C for 10 minutes in air. Photovoltaic devices were fabricated by spin coating the P3HT:PCBM solution onto ZnO-buffered ITO in N2-filled glove box. The spin-coated films were dried at 150 °C for 15 minutes to induce self-organization of P3HT polymer chains. 100 nm thick silver layer was used as the working electrode and was prepared by thermal evaporation. 10 nm thick MoO3 was also deposited by thermal evaporation before deposition of aluminum layer. Current–voltage curves were obtained using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit operated by a custom made LabView software. The solar cells were measured under AM1.5 simulated with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The effective device area (0.09 cm2) was defined by the area of the metal electrodes.

 	Fig. 2  (a) Calculated HSPs of ZnO NPs, pure solvents and mixed solvents (CB-IPA) denoted in HSP space; (b) difference in HSPs between ZnO NPs and mixed solvent having various volume fraction of IPA (ϕ(IPA)). Here, the difference in dispersion solubility parameters (δD) was doubled by considering its contribution to Ra; (c) variation of the relative energy difference (RED) and optical density of the colloidal ZnO NPs solution measured at λ = 400 nm as function of the volume fraction of CB in co-solvent system. Inset graph displays a linear correlation between RED and aggregation; (d) photographs of colloidal solution of ZnO nanoparticles dispersed in various composition of mixed solvent in CB-IPA system.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Optical microscopic images and (b) 3D AFM images (2 μm × 2 μm) of ZnO buffer layers deposited from the colloidal solution of ZnO NPs dispersed in mixed solvent based on CB-IPA having various volumetric fraction of IPA (ϕ(IPA)). Here, the scale bar indicates 10 μm. (c) The root-mean-squared roughness (Rq) from AFM scanned in two different scales (2 μm × 2 μm; 5 μm × 5 μm).
