    , Accepted 9th June 2014First published on 10th June 2014AbstractRemarkable progress has been realized in improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of polymer solar cells (PSCs) over the past few years, raising the possibility of their commercialization as an alternative counterpart to conventional inorganic solar cells. The development of conjugated polymers that contain various alternately bonded electron-rich (D) and electron-deficient (A) units, called D–A alternating copolymers, plays a crucial role in improving the PCE of PSCs, which has now exceeded 8–9%. However, further development of conjugated polymers is essential to produce highly efficient and stable PSCs with a PCE of more than 10% for commercialization. In this regard, terpolymers, which consist of three different units in the polymer backbone, are promising candidates because they can show synergetic effects of each unit by tuning the composition ratio, thereby enabling full-range absorption, high charge mobility, and good solubility. Substantial progress in the development of terpolymers has been achieved with regard to PCE. Herein, we review the development of terpolymers for PSCs and discuss the major factors that need to be considered in the design of new terpolymers.Tae Eui KangTae Eui Kang received her B.S. degree in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering from Sogang University, Republic of Korea in 2009, and M.S degree in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering from KAIST in 2011.

1. Introduction
The ever-increasing demand for energy has become a serious problem all over the world, and polymer solar cells (PSCs) are considered to be one of the promising solar technologies for renewable energy generation, with various advantages, including low-cost, lightweight, flexibility, and solution processability.1–3 Among PSCs, bulk heterojunction (BHJ)-type PSCs which are composed of electron-donating conjugated polymers and electron-accepting fullerene derivatives in active layers between electrodes have been studied extensively, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been increased rapidly to 7–9% in single junction PSCs.4–14 The major breakthrough for the rapid enhancement of PCE is attributed mainly to the development of new conjugated polymers.
One primary requirement of highly efficient conjugated polymers is a suitable match between their light absorption and the photon flux of the solar spectrum. In consideration of the maximum photon flux of the solar spectrum (approximately 700 nm (∼1.77 eV)), the band gap of conjugated polymers should be lower than 1.8 eV.15,16 Moreover, appropriate highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels are essential to ensure efficient hole and electron transfer. For example, sufficient driving force, as determined by the offset between the LUMO energy levels of the conjugated polymer and the electron acceptor, is required for the dissociation of excitons into free charge carriers.17–19 Also, deeper HOMO energy levels of conjugated polymers are preferred to obtain high open-circuit voltage (VOC), which is typically proportional to the difference between the HOMO energy level of the conjugated polymer and the LUMO energy level of the acceptor.20–25 In addition to optical and energetic properties that we need to consider for the design of high performance conjugated polymers, we should pay attention to many other factors, including high hole mobility for efficient charge transport and good solubility/miscibility with electron acceptors, e.g. phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), for optimized BHJ morphology. With the polymers possessing desired properties, we expect high values of short-circuit current (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill-factor (FF) for PSCs, and overall high PCE. Alternating push–pull type copolymers consisting of electron-rich (D) and electron-deficient (A) units in one polymer backbone (D–A alternating copolymers) have been studied extensively by considering all the important factors mentioned above, resulting in a significant enhancement in the device performance of PSCs over the last decade.26–32 In this approach, both HOMO/LUMO energy levels and the band gap of D–A alternating copolymers can be effectively tuned by using a combination of various types of D and A units having different electron-donating and electron-withdrawing strengths via intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). Moreover, the different structures and solubilizing groups of D and A units can change other properties such as the molecular packing and solubility.
Tremendous efforts have been devoted to fine-tune and manipulate the chemical structures and combination of D and A units with the goal of further optimizing the PCE values using D–A alternating copolymers. However, due to the difficulty of developing new D and A units, only a limited number of new backbone units for D–A alternating copolymers have been successful in achieving high PCE values.33–41 In addition, some of the highly efficient D–A alternating copolymers have already achieved the maximum internal quantum efficiency close to 100%.42 Therefore, the efficiency of PSCs based on D–A alternating copolymers now appears to have approached a plateau by just modifying the structure and combination of D and A units. In order to overcome the limitations of the D–A alternating copolymer approach, a new approach is required that can fully exploit the reported D and A moieties and that can delicately manipulate the properties of the conjugated polymers.
From this perspective, terpolymers which consist of three different units in the polymer backbone are promising candidates for designing new conjugated polymers for highly efficient electron donors for PSCs. Using the terpolymer approach, we can exploit the advantages of the reported D and A moieties and add new combinations of them to satisfy the desired properties of conjugated polymers because three different units are used for polymerization. Therefore, adding a third component to D–A alternating copolymers could show synergetic effects on various important properties such as absorption ability, charge mobility, and solubility. Moreover, tuning the molar ratio of the third component in the terpolymer backbone can provide a balance between the required, but different properties mentioned above by enabling fine control of their properties. From these results, several terpolymers already have shown high efficiencies, exceeding 7–8%, demonstrating their great potential as alternative donors for highly efficient PSCs.43–45 The objective of this review is to help readers to gain basic understanding of the overall background and the current state of terpolymers, as well as to provide some useful guidelines for the design of new terpolymers. Herein, we summarize the development of many terpolymers and their photovoltaic performances in accordance with the purpose of their design. For convenient explanation in the next section, we define conjugated polymers that have three different units as “terpolymers” to distinguish them from “D–A alternating copolymers”, which have two different units.
2. Strategy of designing new terpolymers for polymer solar cells
Adding a third component into the alternating D–A copolymer backbone can potentially induce synergetic improvement in the optical, electrical, and structural properties of the polymers. The effect can be modulated and amplified via careful selection of the third component and the sequence of the polymer backbone. Also, the variation of the molar ratio of the three components in the polymer backbone represents another controllable factor for the design of terpolymers, enabling delicate control of the polymer properties. Therefore, many important factors for highly efficient electron donors, including light absorption, HOMO/LUMO energy levels, hole mobility, and solubility/miscibility of the D–A alternating copolymer, can be carefully altered by the insertion of the third component via the terpolymer approach, as shown in Fig. 1. In this review, the principles associated with the design of terpolymers are summarized in accordance with two major purposes.
 Fig. 1  General structure of D–A alternating copolymer and terpolymer: two design purposes of D–A type terpolymers. 
(i) Tuning the absorption range and the HOMO/LUMO energy levels (Fig. 2): many of the recently reported D–A alternating copolymers possess low band gaps, i.e., lower than 1.8 eV, allowing for efficient harvesting of the maximum photon flux of the solar spectrum. In the case of some D–A alternating copolymers, the ICT between the D and A units in the polymer backbone effectively extend light absorption to the near-infrared (NIR) region. However, it was typically accompanied by a decrease of the absorption in the visible region, resulting in the reduction of JSC.46–48 This issue can be alleviated by using the terpolymer approach. The incorporation of an additional electron-rich (1A/2D system) or electron-deficient unit (2A/1D system) as the third unit to a D–A alternating copolymer can extend the range of light absorption through the appearance of a new π–π* or ICT peak, respectively. Also, the HOMO/LUMO energy levels can be controlled by tuning the ratio between three different units because the degree of electron-donating and electron-accepting ability affects the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the conjugated polymers.
 Fig. 2  Two different approaches for achieving broad absorption in terpolymers (a) 1A/2D system (green line); (b) 2A/1D system (orange line); (c) their concept absorption profiles (blue line: D–A alternating copolymer approach). 
(ii) Optimizing and balancing the effects between polymer solubility and molecular packing (Fig. 3): the interpenetrating network morphology of the active layers with nanometer-scale lengths is a prerequisite to facilitate effective exciton dissociation into free charge carriers, thereby producing highly efficient polymer solar cells. The BHJ morphology of the active layer is mainly affected by the solubility of the conjugated polymers and their miscibility with fullerene acceptors. The solubility of conjugated polymers can be controlled by tuning the alkyl solubilizing groups bonded to the polymer backbone. For example, incorporating bulky or long alkyl chains onto the polymer backbone can enhance the solubility of the polymers and their miscibility with fullerene acceptors, producing a finer BHJ domain. On the other hand, these bulky and long alkyl solubilizing chains can prevent the formation of highly ordered molecular packing in thin films and suppress the effective charge transport between polymers. However, the optimization of the alkyl chain as a solubilizing group in D–A alternating copolymers is often difficult and limited because only two different alkyl chains on D and A can be modified. In comparison with the D–A alternating copolymer approach, the terpolymer approach can provide opportunities to better control the balance between these competing effects. For example, in the terpolymer approach, (1) the addition of the judicious choice of a relatively planar third component with a controlled ratio can enhance the π–π interaction of the polymers, while still retaining good solubility and (2) the introduction of different alkyl chains with the same electron-rich (D) or electron-deficient (A) group can provide an opportunity to optimize the solubility and miscibility with fullerene acceptors while maintaining the electrical properties and packing of the polymers.

2.1 Tuning absorption range and HOMO/LUMO energy levels

2.1.1 1A/2D system: one type of electron-deficient unit (A) and two types of electron-rich units (D1 and D2). 
In a 1A/2D (D1 and D2) system, one type of electron-deficient unit (A) and two types of electron-rich units (D1 and D2) comprise the polymer backbone of the terpolymers, with the electron-rich unit of D2 considered as the third component, as shown in Fig. 2a. The effect of modulation in the ratio between D1 and D2 (the content of A is constant) on the light absorption range of terpolymers is typically minimal, producing a new π–π* interaction peak in the short wavelength region as shown in Fig. 2c (almost similar absorption to the blue line of the D–A alternating copolymer), because the LUMO energy level and band gap are strongly determined by the electron-deficient unit (A). Therefore, most researchers have controlled the ratio between A and D2 in order to improve the absorption in the visible region (especially 400–600 nm). This is due to the appearance and the strong intensity of the new π–π* interaction peak when the A content in the polymer backbone is decreased, as represented by the green line in Fig. 2c. For example, Wei et al. added thiophene (D2) into an alternating copolymer based on benzodithiophene (BDT = D1) and pyridopyrazine (PP = A) (P1-a); they also incorporated bithiophene (D2) into another copolymer composed of cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) (D1) and PP (A) (P2-a) in order to obtain strong absorption in the visible region (400–600 nm) (Fig. 4 and Table 1).49 The terpolymers of P1-a and P2-a were synthesized with the same ratio of A:D2 (PP:thiophene = 1:1 and PP:bithiophene = 1:1) and showed slightly blue-shifted absorption, but broader absorption in the region of 350–800 nm than P1 and P2 (the parent copolymers), respectively. Since the replacement of A with the D2 unit made the electron-donating characteristics of the terpolymers stronger than those of the parent copolymers, the HOMO energy level was higher, leading to slightly lower VOC and a larger optical band gap than the parent copolymers. Despite the wide band gap and low VOC, the performances of terpolymer devices were improved due to the enhanced visible absorption, thereby leading to a significant increase of JSC, from 4.69 to 6.41 mA cm−2 for P1-a and from 6.26 to 10.85 mA cm−2 for P2-a.

Using the same strategy, to complement the lack of absorption between 400 and 600 nm, thiophene (D1) was incorporated into a low band gap polymer, PCPDTBT (P3) (Fig. 5 and Table 1).50 Since 0.5 eq. of the cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT = D2) was added to P3-a, the content of the acceptor portion, benzothiadiazole (BT = A), was less than P3, resulting in the absorption onset being blue-shifted. Even though P3-a had a wider band gap and a lower VOC than P3, its overall absorption in the visible region was enhanced, thereby improving the PCE from 1.4 to 2.0%. It was increased further to 2.2%, by replacing the bridging carbon atom (CPDT) with silicon (dithienosilole: DTS) (P3-d). In addition, other polymers were produced by replacing the BT (A) with quinoxaline (QU) (P3-b) and thienopyrazine (P3-c). Because the quinoid character decreased in the order of thienopyrazine, BT, and QU, the band gap was wider in the same order, i.e., 1.20, 1.59, and 1.77 eV, respectively. However, both P3-b and P3-c exhibited poor performances, which were attributed to relatively low charge mobility and insufficient driving force for charge dissociation, respectively. From the results of P3-c, the LUMO–LUMO offset between the polymer and PCBM should be large enough for efficient charge dissociation. However, if the LUMO–LUMO offset is too large, it can cause the loss of VOC, thus the fine-tuning of the LUMO energy level in conjugated polymers is important,19 which can be achieved well via the terpolymer approach. As an example, the LUMO energy level of P4 based on diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP = A) and C16 (linear) benzotrithiophene (BTT = D1) was effectively tuned by adding BTT with 1-octylnonyl (D2) as the second electron-rich unit (Fig. 5).51 The incorporation of a small portion of C8C8-BTT (D2) in P4-a increased the solubility and also the LUMO energy level by about 0.1 eV, enabling efficient charge dissociation. The PSCs based on the terpolymer of P4-a exhibited a PCE of 4.28% due to the enhanced JSC value (12.07 mA cm−2) compared to the JSC (6.30 mA cm−2) and PCE (2.68%) values of P4, the parent copolymer.
 Fig. 5  Chemical structures of P3–P5 (Table 1). 
The above-mentioned examples show synergetic effects by the addition of the third component at one fixed ratio (i.e., D2:A), but another important parameter in terpolymers is the ratio of three different units that can be controlled. The optical and electrical properties of terpolymers are influenced significantly by the ratio of the three different monomers, therefore it is important to optimize the composition ratio to maximize the PCE of solar cells. For this reason, three new terpolymers based on thiophene (D1), dithienothiophene (DTT = D2), and DPP (A) with different ratios between DPP (A) and DTT (D2) from 1:1 (P5) to 1:2 (P5-a) to 1:3 (P5-b) were developed by Chen et al. (Fig. 5).52,53 The increased amount of DTT (D2) and the simultaneous reduction in the content of DPP (A) provided stronger absorption of the short wavelength, whereas that of the long wavelength was decreased. The best ratio of DPP (A) to DTT (D2) was 1:2, producing a PCE of 3.58%. Other terpolymers with the same A:D2 ratio of 1:2 were synthesized by replacing the dodecyl chain on DPP (A) with 2-ethylhexyl (P5-c), 2-butyloctyl (P5-d), and 2-octyldodecyl (P5-e), and, among them, 2-butyloctyl (P5-d) showed a noticeable enhancement in the PCE of 5.02% with PC71BM, due to the formation of the optimized BHJ morphology. Also, BT (A) or DPP (A) was incorporated into the polymers based on thiophene (D1) and ladder-type, multi-fused thienyl–phenylene–thienylene–phenylene–thienyl (TPTPT = D2) to afford terpolymers, P6(-a) and P7(-a, -b), respectively, by modulating the ratio between A and D2 (Fig. 6 and Table 1).54 As the A/D2 ratio was increased, the onset of absorption gradually red-shifted and the range of absorption was broader. Since DPP is a more electron-deficient unit than BT, P7-a had a lower band gap (1.37 eV) and a LUMO energy level (−3.41 eV) than those of P6-a (1.68 eV and −3.30 eV, respectively). Among them, the solar cell based on P7-a with an A:D2 ratio of 2:1 achieved the best PCE of 4.3% with a higher JSC of 10.78 mA cm−2, which was attributed mainly to broad absorption and high hole mobility. Recently, Tan et al. reported three different terpolymers (P8, P8-a, and P8-b), which were based on benzodithiophene (BDT = D1) with different ratios between DPP (A) and thiophene that have a side group of vinylene-dithienyl-benzothiadiazole (TVDTBT = D2) in order to improve absorption in the range from 300 to 600 nm and to lower the HOMO energy level (Fig. 6).55 As the ratio between DPP (A) and TVDTBT (D2) was changed from 3:1 (P8), to 1:1 (P8-a), and to 1:3 (P8-b), the absorption in the range of 300–600 nm was enhanced, but the absorption in the range of 580–820 nm induced by ICT between BDT (D1) and DPP (A) decreased gradually. In addition, the HOMO energy level was gradually reduced, thereby improving the VOC value from 0.72, to 0.74, to 0.78 V. The best performance of the device was obtained for the blend of P8-b/PC61BM, with a PCE of 5.29%, which was attributed to broad absorption and the high VOC value compared to P8 and P8-a.
 Fig. 6  Chemical structures of P6–P9 (Table 1). 
Another interesting example of the terpolymers with enhanced light absorption has been demonstrated by Thompson et al. The incorporation of a small amount of DPP (A) (5% for P9, 10% for P9-a, 15% for P9-b) into P3HT (homopolymer) is an effective way to enhance the absorption range of P3HT to the longer wavelength while maintaining its properties, such as high hole mobility and crystallinity (Fig. 6).56 The band gaps of P9 (1.52 eV), P9-a (1.51 eV), and P9-b (1.46 eV) decreased gradually as the amount of DPP (A) was increased, but the HOMO energy level of all the terpolymers was −5.2 eV, which was equal to that of P3HT. However, the VOC values slightly reduced as the DPP contents increased. The reasons for reduced VOC were the increased recombination rate and the degree of aggregation. Among the solar cells, those based on P9-a had the best PCE of 4.94%, and both P9 (3.60%) and P9-b (4.10%) had better PCEs than P3HT (3.41%), mainly due to the broad light absorption. However, the selection of the electron-deficient unit in the terpolymers based on P3HT was crucial because different electron-deficient strengths with varying chemical structures can have adverse effects on the crystallinity of P3HT, charge generation/recombination and thus, the device performance.57–59


2.1.2 2A/1D system: two types of electron-deficient units (A1 and A2) and one type of electron-rich unit (D). 
In the 2A (A1 and A2)/1D system, the terpolymers are composed of two types of electron-deficient units (A1 and A2) and one type of electron-rich unit (D), where the third component is an electron-deficient unit, as shown in Fig. 2b. In this case, the ratio of two different electron-deficient units (A1/A2) is controlled to optimize various properties of the terpolymers, such as the light absorption band, the HOMO/LUMO energy levels, etc. Unlike the 1A/2D (D1 and D2) system, which is typically designed to complement the lack of absorption in the visible region by the appearance of a new π–π* interaction peak, the 2A (A1 and A2)/1D system can extend its absorption wavelength into the near-infrared (NIR) region due to the appearance of a new ICT band, leading to a broad absorption range due to the overlap of the two ICT absorption bands, as represented by the orange line in Fig. 2c. Thus, the judicious selection of two electron-deficient units that have different accepting abilities is important for producing complementary and broad absorption, because the ICT peak is strongly dependent on the strength of the electron-deficient unit. As shown in Fig. 7 and Table 2, Wei et al. reported three different terpolymers (P10, P10-a, and P10-b) with complementary light absorption based on electron-rich alkylthienyl-substituted benzodithiophene (BDTT = D), electron-deficient benzooxadiazole (BO = A1) and DPP (A2) by changing the ratio of BO (A1) and DPP (A2) from 3:7 (P10), 5:5 (P10-a), and 7:3 (P10-b).60 As the portion of DPP (A2) increased, the absorption spectra were red-shifted due to the additional ICT absorption between BDTT (D) and DPP (A2). Also, the P10, P10-a, and P10-b absorbed a broader range of light than their parent copolymers (PBDTTBO and PBDTTDPP). The best performance, a PCE of 6.8%, was observed for P10-a/PC71BM due to its broad absorption, appropriate hole mobility, and good miscibility with PC71BM. Other successful examples of terpolymers based on DPP were synthesized by Jo et al. (Fig. 7).61 For complementary absorption, they controlled the ratios of DPP (A1) and isoindigo (ID = A2) (3:7, 5:5, 7:3) in the terpolymer based on thiophene (D). The increased ratio of DPP (A1), i.e., from 3:7 for P11-a, to 5:5 for P11-b, and to 7:3 for P11-c, induced red-shifted absorption and a lower HOMO energy level. This slight change in the composition ratio from 3:7 (P11-a) to 5:5 (P11-b) effectively improved the PCE from 3.49% to 6.04%, due to the significant increase in the value of JSC from 7.84 to 13.52 mA cm−2. Thus, it is apparent that optimizing the composition ratio in the terpolymer is important to maximize the performance of the device. Recently, we developed a series of five random terpolymers and compared them with two parent copolymers, PBDTTDPP (P12) and PBDTTTPD (P12-f) to investigate the influence of composition ratio on the device performance as shown in Fig. 7.62 In this study, DPP (A1) and thienopyrrolodione (TPD = A2) were used as the electron-deficient units and BDTT (D) was used as the electron-rich unit. The amount of DPP (A1) was decreased in the order of P12-a (90:10), P12-b (75:25), P12-c (50:50), P12-d (25:75), and P12-d (10:90). As the amount of DPP (A1) was increased, the absorption spectra were red-shifted, and the ICT peaks of DPP (A1) and BDTT (D) increased (while those for TPD (A2) and BDTT (D) decreased), and the HOMO energy level was increased, thereby reducing the VOC. The optimum ratio of DPP (A1) to TPD (A2) was 75:25 (P12-b), and the highest PCE (5.61%) was obtained by the blend of P12-b and PC71BM. Interestingly, the performances of P12-d (3.02%) and P12-e (2.09%) were inferior to those of the two parent copolymers (P12 and P12-f, 5.03% and 5.10%, respectively). The main reason for the low performance of the devices was the small portion of DPP (A1) in the terpolymer, which served as trap sites, preventing the pre-separation of the excitons in the polymer backbone. In addition, the performances of P12-b were further optimized to a PCE of 6.33% by incorporating methanol treatment.63–65 These results emphasized that controlling the composition ratio of two electron-deficient units is of great importance in optimizing the electrical and optical properties of the terpolymers. In addition to the examples of the 2A/1D type terpolymers described above, other researchers also have demonstrated that the terpolymer approach is a very promising candidate for panchromatic absorption, covering the entire visible spectrum up to the NIR region by controlling the ratios of the different components.66–69

2.2 Optimizing the polymer solubility, packing structure, and BHJ morphology

2.2.1 Incorporation of a third component with rigid structure into the polymer backbone. 
In addition to light absorption, other factors for conjugated polymers should be considered, including their charge mobility, miscibility with PCBM, and crystallinity for their application in PSCs.28,70–72 Among them, high charge mobility is essential for better charge transport. In general, to achieve good charge transport in D–A alternating copolymers, it is crucial to incorporate a planar moiety in conjugated backbones and thus increase the coplanarity (effective conjugation length) and interchain π–π interactions.73–75 However, at the same time, if the degrees of coplanarity and interchain π–π interactions in D–A alternating copolymers are too high, the copolymers can have low solubility, resulting in difficulties in the synthesis of high molecular weight polymers and in device fabrication via solution processing. Although the need for both high hole mobility and suitable solubility in D–A alternating copolymers has been well recognized, the D–A alternating copolymer approach has certain limitations in compromising these competing effects. The terpolymer approach can provide additional freedom in the polymer design in order to control the balance between strong interchain π–π interactions (polymer packing) and solubility (i.e., by regulating the molar ratio between relatively planar and soluble units in the polymer backbone) as shown in Fig. 3.
Choi et al. reported terpolymers that consisted of two electron-rich units of anthradithiophene (ADT = D1) and BDT (D2), and one electron-deficient unit, thienothiophene (TT = A) (Fig. 8 and Table 3).76 The ratio of ADT (D1) to BDT (D2) in the polymers was decreased in the order of P13 (1:0), P13-a (3:1), P13-b (1:1), P13-c (1:3), and P13-d (0:1). The incorporation of the ADT (D1) units enhanced the hole mobility through extended conjugation, whereas the BDT (D2) showed better solubility than ADT (D1). Therefore, the degree of interchain π–π interactions and the solubility of terpolymers can be tuned by controlling the ratio of ADT (D1) to BDT (D2). Also, the band gaps and the hole mobilities of the terpolymers can be tailored. As the content of the BDT (D2) increased, it was observed that the optical band gap increased, while the hole mobility of the terpolymers decreased simultaneously. For example, the hole mobility changed gradually from P13-c (1.26 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) to P13-a (1.91 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), as measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. Even for a high hole mobility and a low band gap, the efficiency of a solar cell based on P13-a/PC71BM exhibited a PCE of only 1.76%, due in large part to the pronounced phase separation in the BHJ active layer. However, the P13-c with a composition ratio of ADT:BDT of 1:3 was an optimum terpolymer, exhibiting both good hole mobility and solubility and thus producing a much-enhanced PCE value of 4.10%. Further improvement in the device performance (i.e., PCE = 5.61%) can be achieved for P13-e, which has a fluorinated version of TT (A) but with the same ADT:BDT ratio of 1:3 as P13-c. Another example of terpolymers (P14, P14-a, and P14-b) based on thiophene (D) was demonstrated by Fu et al., by controlling the ratio of DPP (A1) to benzothiadiazole (BTD = A2) (Fig. 8).77 The ratio of DPP (A1) to BTD (A2) in the polymers was increased in the order of P14 (3:7), P14-a (1:1), and P14-b (7:3). While the BTD (A2) unit with two alkoxy chains enhanced the solubility of the terpolymer, the role of DPP (A1) was to increase the planarity of the backbone, promoting strong intermolecular interactions between the polymers. P14-b with a higher DPP (A1) ratio had a better hole mobility of 0.40 cm2 V−1 s−1 than P14-a (0.17 cm2 V−1 s−1) and P14 (0.05 cm2 V−1 s−1) in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). However, in contrast to the trend in OFET mobilities, the efficiency of these polymer-based PSCs gradually decreased as the amount of DPP (A1) increased due to the reduction in the solubility of the polymers and their miscibility with PCBM, which was caused by strong π–π interactions of DPP (A1).

In another case, incorporation of pyrene groups into PCDTBT (P15) and PBDTDTBT (P16) in order to increase the hole mobility was reported by Hwang et al. (Fig. 8).78 The pyrene group has a very rigid and planar structure, which can facilitate the formation of π–π stacking between the polymers. Therefore, the amounts of pyrene in the terpolymers were adjusted from 5% (P15-a and P16-a), 10% (P15-b and P16-b), to 20% (P15-c and P16-c), whereas the contents of benzothiadiazole (BT) were decreased. Predictably, P15-c and P16-c, with high contents of pyrenes (20%), had significantly improved hole mobilities of 2.4 × 10−3 and 3.8 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, compared to their parent copolymers, P15 and P16 (6.0 × 10−5 and 5.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively). However, the PCE values of P15-c and P16-c were low due to their poor solubility, resulting in the formation of non-optimized BHJ morphology. In contrast, the P15-a and P16-b with optimized pyrene contents had the best PCEs of 3.22% and 5.04%, respectively, which were attributed to their influence on balancing both the hole mobility and solubility.


2.2.2 Adding a third component with different alkyl solubilizing groups. 
The solubility of conjugated polymers is an important parameter in synthesizing high molecular weight polymers so that they can retain high electrical and optical properties as well as the appropriate miscibility with PCBM and the desired BHJ morphology.72,79–81 Therefore, many studies have been performed to enhance the solubility of conjugated polymers by tailoring the alkyl side chains from their linear configuration to a longer, bulkier group.82,83 However, modifying the side chains of conjugated polymers can also have a significant influence on the molecular packing and their optical and electrical properties.84–91 For example, the incorporation of longer or bulkier solubilizing alkyl side chains generally results in improvement of the polymer solubility, but it can disrupt the formation of the packing structure in thin films and, thus, induce poor charge transport by increasing steric hindrance and insulating parts. Even slight modifications of the alkyl chain structure can result in dramatic changes in the photovoltaic performance. In these regards, the terpolymer approach can provide opportunities to achieve a delicate balance between these competing effects by tuning electron-deficient or electron-rich groups that have the same backbones but have different alkyl chain units (Fig. 3). Bao et al. reported a series of terpolymers (P17-a, P17-b, and P17-c) that resulted from adding a third component (A2) that had the same backbone structure but had different and much longer solubilizing groups of low molecular weight polystyrene (PS) side chains on the isoindigo (Fig. 9 and Table 4).92 The contents of isoindigo with the PS side chain (A2) to isoindigo with 2-octyl-dodecanyl group (A1) were increased in the order of P17 (0:100), P17-a (5:95), P17-b (10:90), P17-c (33:67), to P17-d (100:0). The terpolymers of P17-a, P17-b, and P17-c had better solubility and processability than the polymers without the PS side chains (P17). The optimum PCE value can be obtained by tuning the composition ratio of A1/A2, thereby providing both good solubility/processability and good molecular ordering. These optimized properties account for the enhanced PCE value of P17-b (7.0%) over that of P17 (6.5%). However, the terpolymers that contained more than 10% of isoindigo with PS side chains (A2) had lower PCE values due to the decreased molecular ordering and hole mobility.

In the previous work, the content of the third component (A2) was increased gradually in order to improve the solubility of the D–A alternating copolymer, but, in the next case, Yang et al. incorporated a third component for enhancing the polymer packing. Yang et al. developed terpolymers consisting of two different DPP electron-deficient units with different solubilizing groups of butyloctyl chains (A1) and triethylene glycol (TEG, A2), which is known to facilitate the self-assembly of the conjugated polymers (Fig. 9).44 In detail, they produced four different terpolymers by incorporating TEG-functionalized DPP (A2) into the PBDT D–A polymer (P18) by manipulating the ratio of butyloctyl chains on DPP (A1) and TEG-functionalized DPP (A2). As the amount of A2 unit was increased from P18 (1:0), P18-a (0.95:0.05), P18-b (0.90:0.10), P18-c (0.75:0.25), to P18-d (0.50:0.50), a slightly red-shifted and broad shoulder around 830–900 nm of light absorption was observed, which was ascribed to better π–π stacking induced by the TEG side chains. The optimized properties of suitable morphology and enhanced structural ordering were achieved in P18-b, yielding a PCE of 7.0% with PC71BM. However, the PCE values of P18-c (4.7%) and P18-d (3.2%) with higher TEG content (A2) were inferior to that of the parent copolymer, P18 (6.2%), because the TEG groups have the strong tendency to aggregate, which adversely influenced the BHJ morphology blended with PC71BM.

3. Random terpolymers vs. regular terpolymers: effect of different monomer sequences in terpolymers
Most of the terpolymers that were mentioned in the previous section are categorized as “random terpolymers” in which three different monomers or units are connected randomly to each other without regularity, as shown in Fig. 10a. The batch-to-batch variation for random terpolymers is relatively large due to the random linkage, and their sequence is determined dominantly by the reactivity of each monomer.93 The other class of terpolymers are regular terpolymers in which the sequence of all three units is regular in the polymer backbone (Fig. 10b). For example, the regular terpolymer (P19-a) consisting of DPP (A), terthiophene (D1 = 3T) and thiophene–phenylene–thiophene (D2 = TPT) was synthesized by Janssen et al. (Fig. 11 and Table 5).43 In the case of regular terpolymers, the trimer, A–D2–A, was first synthesized and then used as a monomer in the reaction with D1 to produce P19-a. Two parent copolymers, i.e., PDPP3T (P19) and PDPPTPT (P19-b), also were prepared as references. The energy level and the optical band gap of P19-a were located between those of P19 and P19-b, and the best device, fabricated with P19-a, reached a PCE of 8.0% due to its optimal energy level/optical band gap as well as better BHJ morphology.

Most recently, new regular terpolymers (P20-a and P20-b) were developed by incorporating a trimer (A–D1–A) based on BDT-R2 (D1) and fluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (FBT = A) into BDT-R2 (D1) or BDT-R1 (D2), respectively (Fig. 11).45 In P20-b, two different alkyl chain-substituted BDTs bearing 2-ethylhexyl-3-hexylthiophene (BDT-R2) (D1) and 2-ethylhexyl thiophene (BDT-R1) (D2) were used. In other words, the density of the alkyl chain in P20-b was less than that in P20-a. For comparison, the parent polymer (P20) based on BDT-R2 (D2) and FBT (A) was prepared. Due to the controllable reactivity of FBT (A), the trimer can have the regular orientation of the fluorine atom on the FBT (A), while, in the case of P20, the orientation of the fluorine was random. The different orientations of fluorine significantly influenced the polymer packing and performance of the P20 device (3.91%) and the P20-a device (5.92%), although the backbone sequences of P20 and P20-a were identical. Among the three polymers, superior performance was achieved for P20-b (7.80%) due to the regioregular arrangement and lower density of the alkyl chain, resulting in a lower band gap, shorter stacking distance, and higher hole mobility than P20 and P20-a. This feature raised the important questions about the effect of the sequence of three different units in the polymer backbone (random vs. regular terpolymer) on the polymer properties and their PSC performance.
Wang et al. provided an interesting insight into the effect of the sequence of the polymer backbone on the device performance (Fig. 11).94 Their report demonstrated that the efficiency decreased in the order of D–A1–D–A2 (regular terpolymer: P21-c) > D–A1 (P21), D–A2 (P21-a) (alternative copolymer) > D–A1–D–A2–random (random terpolymer: P21-b) > blend of D–A1 (P21) and D–A2 (P21-a). They also compared a random terpolymer (P21-b) with a regular terpolymer (P21-c), each of which had the same amount of each component in the polymer backbone. The absorption spectra of P21-c were slightly broader in the long wavelength than those of P21-b, which might be attributed to the better π–π stacking of P21-c due to its regioregular structure. However, structural differences had almost no effect on the HOMO/LUMO levels of the two polymers. The best device, fabricated with P21-c/PC61BM, exhibited a PCE of 5.03%, outperforming the device fabricated with P21-b/PC61BM (PCE of 4.37%). To further improve the efficiency, they incorporated fluorine atoms into P21-c to form P21-d, which then produced a PCE of 6.32% due to the deeper HOMO level and the formation of better interpenetrating BHJ morphology.95 Another comparison of random terpolymers and regular terpolymers was provided by the work of Chen et al. (Fig. 12 and Table 5).96 They developed five random terpolymers (from P22 to P22-d) with different composition ratios of phenanthrocarbazole (PC = D1), thiophene (D2), and BT (A) and then compared them with a regular terpolymer (P22-e) that consisted of the same combinations of the units. The ratio of PC (D1) to BT (A) with fixed thiophene (D2) content was decreased in the order of P22 (3:1), P22-a (2:1), P22-b (1:1), P22-c (1:2), and P22-d (1:3). The higher fraction of PC (D1) induced a better molecular packing and charge transport with lower intensity of the ICT absorption band, whereas the high content of BT (A) caused poor morphology and a high HOMO energy level. Among the random terpolymers, P22-a (PC:BT = 2:1) had the best PCE of 1.9%, which, however, was lower than the PCE of the regular terpolymer, P22-e (2.3%). This slight improvement in the PCE of the regular terpolymers might be due to the improved better charge transport induced by the regular linkage. However, the benefits of the random terpolymer approach should not be ignored because the device performance was affected by many different factors. One of the most important advantages of the random terpolymers is their capability of tuning the composition ratios between the components, which can further optimize the band gap, the HOMO/LUMO energy levels, and other properties at the same time. Chen et al. provided an interesting example in which they compared a regular terpolymer (P23) based on DPP (A), DTT (D1), and thiophene (D2) with a random terpolymer (P23-a) with the optimum ratio of DPP to DTT of 1:2 (Fig. 12).53 Despite the fact that P23 had better hole mobility, the highest PCE (3.44%) of the P23:PC71BM devices was lower than that of the P23-a:PC71BM system (5.02%). This was probably due to the non-optimized absorption and the energy level at the fixed composition ratio in the backbone of the regular terpolymers. From the findings of the previous studies, the differences between random terpolymers and regular terpolymers can be summarized as shown below:26,97–99
 Fig. 12  Chemical structures of P22–P23 (Table 5). 
(1) In the polymerization of a random terpolymer, the actual ratios between the three different monomers can be different from the feed ratios; therefore, the actual ratio should be confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and elemental analysis (EA). For regular terpolymers, the preparation of the trimer is often difficult and more time-consuming.
(2) While randomly distributed monomers in random terpolymers induce broader absorption in the overall wavelength, the vibronic peaks of the regular terpolymers were more pronounced due to better π–π stacking, which is also correlated with high hole mobility.
(3) By adjusting the ratios between three components in random terpolymers, the properties of the polymers (i.e., light absorption, HOMO/LUMO energy levels, charge mobility, and solubility) can be fine-tuned, whereas this cannot be done in regular terpolymers.
4. Conclusions and outlook
Over the past few years, the advance in D–A alternating copolymers has been the major driving force for the improvement of the PCE up to 8–9% in single junction PSCs. However, further development of conjugated polymers is essential to achieve PSCs with a theoretical PCE of more than 10% for commercialization. Such development must take into account (1) broad absorption with a high absorption coefficient, (2) suitable HOMO/LUMO energy levels for high VOC and charge separation, (3) good solubility to increase the molecular weight and good miscibility with PCBM, and (4) high hole mobility for better charge transport. Compared to D–A alternating copolymers, the terpolymers can utilize a third component with a controlled monomer ratio for better control of material properties mentioned above. Although fundamental understanding of the structure–property relationship for terpolymers, such as the effect of the third component on charge separation and recombination, is still in the early stage, several terpolymers have already shown high efficiencies exceeding 7–8%. We believe that terpolymer-based PSCs have the potential to provide high performance for real commercialization. In addition, the use of terpolymers can be expanded to other organic electronic devices, because desired material properties for specific applications can be realized via effective synthetic control of the polymer structure for terpolymers.
