    , Accepted 30th April 2021First published on 6th May 2021AbstractPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) with state-of-the-art efficiencies contain thermally unstable methylammonium (MA). Avoiding MA molecules usually leads to a severe decrease in the cell efficiency. In this work, a novel ion liquid (simplified as NDAPBF4) possessing a pyridine cation and BF4− anion were introduced to improve the performance of MA-free PSCs. The ion liquid NDAPBF4 can optimize the grain growth of the perovskite, leading to reduced carrier traps. In particular, NDAPBF4 served as an n-type dopant and boosted the electron transportation in the perovskite films, which further suppressed the carrier non-radiative recombination at the interface between the perovskite and the electron transporting layer. Finally, PSCs with a Cs0.05FA0.95PbI3 perovskite film as the absorber achieved a remarkable efficiency of 21.25%, which was one of the highest MA-free inverted perovskite solar cells up to date. PSCs doped with NDAPBF4 also gave excellent stability, which preserved 95% and 94% of the initial efficiency after being aged for 1000 h and 500 h under room temperature and elevated temperature at 85 °C, respectively.
Introduction
The long-range balanced bipolar carrier transport, ideal direct energy band and low temperature solution processability of the hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite make it highly desirable for optoelectronic applications such as solar cells,1–3 light-emitting diodes4–6 and photodetectors.7,8 With the efficiency rapidly progressing to over 25%, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have gained extensive attention, and are of great promise for commercialization use. The organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite has a structure of ABX3, where cesium (Cs), methylammonium (MA), and formamidinium (FA) are candidates for A-site cations, Pb for B-site and halide for X site. PSCs-containing MA cations represent the state-of-art efficiencies for all types of PSCs. However, the volatile nature of MA usually leads to MA vacancies and irreversible degeneration in the perovskite structures at elevated temperatures. As an alternative, MA-free PSCs based on the double-cation of CsFA have emerged, where Cs is mainly to suppress the lattice distortion in perovskite structures induced by large FA cations.
Avoiding MA components is expected to improve the thermal and operational stability of PSCs. However, it will sacrifice the efficiency of the photovoltaic devices. Currently, most inverted MA-free PSCs only give highest efficiency values of less than 21%, which is far from their theoretical limit. In fact, improving the efficiency of MA-free PSCs has always been a hot issue. To this end, Dong et al. used the conjugated polyelectrolyte (PFN–Br) as dopants to optimize the CsFA perovskite with a well-matched energy level, and encouraged carrier extraction and transportation. The PV devices gave an efficiency of up to 20.32% mainly caused by a 60 meV VOC enhancement.9 Yao and co-workers used bis-fulleropyrrolidium iodide to construct a strong interface band-bonding between the perovskite and the ETL. Such a band structure helps to reduce the interface trap density and boost the electron extraction. Finally, they obtained MA-free PSCs with a champion efficiency of 21.1%.10 More recently, Ning et al. reported Cs-rich MA-free PSCs, where the Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3 grains were covered by a CsxFA1−xPbI3 quasi-shell.11 The final MA-free photovoltaic device exhibited an efficiency of 20.7% with improved operation stability, which retained over 95% of its initial efficiency under MPP tracking for 1000 h.
On the other hand, ion liquids with cations and anions possess high conductivity, thermal and electrochemical stability, and have been widely used in various optoelectronic applications.12,13 In the PSCs field, ion liquids have been used to improve the conductivity of the electron transportation layer (ETL), or as the interlayer to passivate the detrimental interfacial defects between the ETL and the perovskite.1,14,15 Ion liquids have multifunctional groups, which can interact with the bulk perovskite. Among them, tetrafluoro borate-based ion liquids are emerging candidates for the high-quality perovskite film with large grains and reduced defect density. Snaith et al. reported the introduction of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMIMBF4) into the ETL and perovskite interface, resulting in a more n-type perovskite film with lower trap density and more efficient electron transport.16 In their other work, they introduced a small amount of BIMBF4 into the perovskite precursor. They found that this amount of such ion liquid can improve the device performance and stability.14 Moreover, in Jen's work, NH4BF4 was used and acted as an addictive. They showed that BF4− can partially substitute the halide from the perovskite and form the FA0.83MA0.17Pb(IBr)3−x(BF4)x perovskite, which resulted in reduced nonradiative recombination.17 However, up to date, using BF4−-based ion liquids as the additive to fabricate the high-quality perovskite films, especially for the MA-free perovskite film, has rarely been reported.
In this study, we introduced an ion liquid N-cyanogen-4-dimethylamino-pyridine tetrafluoroborate (NDAPBF4) with pyridine cation and BF4− anion as the additive to improve the film quality of the MA-free perovskite with a formulation of Cs0.05FA0.95PbI3. It was found that the pyridine cation can passivate the undercoordinated Pb2+, while the BF4− anion is in favor of the perovskite grain growth. As a result, the performances of the MA-free based devices are substantially enhanced. The MA-free PSCs treated by NDAPBF4 gave a much enhanced open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF), which promoted the PCE up to 21.25%. To the best of our knowledge, it is one of the highest efficiencies for the MA-free inverted PSCs up to date. Notably, NDAPBF4 can also work as a stabilizer, which shows improved stability under thermal annealing (94% remain under 85 °C annealing for 500 h). We believe that the multifunctional ion liquid provides new insight into the design of high-performance MA-free PSCs with enhanced stability.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a depicts the device structure of the MA-free PSCs in this work, which is constructed by a planar stack of ITO/PTAA/perovskite/C60/BCP/Cu. The perovskite film was prepared by means of a one-step antisolvent strategy, where the precursor solutions with different molar ratios of NDAPBF4 to the perovskite from 0% to 2% were used. The chemical structure of NDAPBF4 is highlighted by a dashed rectangle in Fig. 1a, which has a cyanogen group with a pyridine cation branch and a dissociative BF4− anion. The electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution in NDAPBF4 was simulated via density function theory (DFT), and the result is presented in Fig. 1b. On the one hand, the cyanogen group bonded with a pyridine cation represents the electronic deficiency area (positive area), which is expected to coordinate with the undercoordinated Pb2+.18,19 On the other hand, the tetrafluoroboron anion (BF4−) exhibits the highest electron density (negative area), which has the potential to incorporate into the perovskite lattice structure compensating the iodine vacancies.20 To investigate the effect of NDAPBF4 on the device performance, we characterized the performance of the solar cells with different molar ratios of NDAPBF4. The statistics of the device performances are displayed in Fig. 1c. It can be found that the control device gave a PCE of 19.18%. When doped with 0.5% NDAPBF4, the PSCs delivered a champion PCE of 21.25%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest PCE for MA-free PSCs with an inverted structure up to date (Table S1†). Further increasing the amount of NDAPBF4, the device performance drops obviously. It is noted that the maximal VOC (1.11 V) values were obtained for the PSCs with 1% NDAPBF4 (Table 1). However, the decrease in JSC and FF finally resulted in declined efficiency of the PSCs. The I–V curves of the champion and control devices are plotted in Fig. 1d, whereas the forward–reverse scan is plotted in Fig. S1.† The hysteresis index was further calculated with the following equation:21Hysteresis index = (PCEReverse − PCEForward)/PCEReverse

The calculated hysteresis indexes for the control and 0.5% NDAPBF4 devices are 0.090 and 0.028, respectively. This result indicates that the introduction of NDAPBF4 can obtain a smaller hysteresis.
The significant improvement of PCE can be attributed to VOC (from 1.04 V to 1.10 V) and FF (from 0.80 to 0.83). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) in Fig. 1e demonstrates an integrated current density of 22.89 mA cm−2 and 23.67 mA cm−2 for the control and 0.5% NDAPBF4 devices, corresponding with the results from the I–V measurement. It is noteworthy that the improvement of EQE in the whole region can be derived from the improved perovskite bulk and interface properties,22 whereas the increment in 300–500 nm may be ascribed to Mie scattering with the enlarged grain size (around 400 nm).23,24Fig. 1f shows the evolution of the output current density for the champion device under maximum power point (MPP) with a bias of 0.94 V. A stabilized PCE of 20.89% is derived for the champion device.
The film quality of the perovskite is of paramount importance for the performance of the PSCs. Here, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were conducted to evaluate the film quality of the perovskite. In this part, to have better insight into the morphology and crystallization change, only the control perovskite film and that doped with 0.5% NDAPBF4 were characterized. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, NDAPBF4 brings about an obvious increase in the perovskite grain size. The average grain size deduced from the high-resolution SEM image was determined to be 400 nm (control) and 600 nm for the control and the perovskite with 0.5% NDAPBF4, respectively, as depicted in Fig. 2c. This result can also be found from the cross-sectional SEM (Fig. S2†). This phenomenon demonstrates that NDAPBF4 can positively influence the crystallization kinetics of the perovskite. Interestingly, the AFM characterization in Fig. 2d and f suggests that the surface root-mean roughness (RMS) is almost unchanged (from 23.8 nm to 24.2 nm).

Fig. 2f shows the XRD results of the control and the perovskite with 0.5% NDAPBF4. The characteristic diffraction peaks in 14.3°, 28.4° and 40.5° belong to the (111), (222) and (024) planes of α-FAPbI3 (P3m1 space group). In the control sample, weak lattice diffraction peaks at 12.7° and 12.1° are clearly resolved, which are respectively assigned to the (001) plane of PbI2 and the (010) plane of δ-FAPbI3 (P63mc space group).25 For NDAPBF4-treated target perovskite films, the ratio of the (111) to (222) planes are much more enhanced, representing more oriented grain growth with respect to the control ones. No resolution of additional XRD peaks, except those belonging to α-FAPbI3, indicates that introduction of 0.5% NDAPBF4 into the perovskite does not change the perovskite crystalline structures, which is consistent with previous reports that the concentration of the dopants in the range of 0.1%–1% are beneficial for PCE in the CsFA perovskite films, where the higher dopant concentration tends to change the crystalline structure of the perovskite.26 However, when the concentration of NDAPBF4 exceeded 1%, the δ-FAPbI3 began to appear, and the peak intensity decreased substantially with the increasing of NDAPBF4 (Fig. S3†). This result also indicates that 0.5% NDAPBF4 can effectively suppress the formation of δ-FAPbI3 and PbI2. It is noted that NDAPBF4 induces a ∼0.02° shift in the diffraction peaks, corresponding to a reduced facet distance (Fig. S4†). Similar results have been observed in previous reports, which are explained by the smaller radius of the BF4− ions that are incorporated into the perovskite lattice.15

Fig. 3a shows the absorption spectra of the control and the perovskite films with NDAPBF4. It is suggested that the absorption edges of both perovskite films cut off at around 810 nm, corresponding to a bandgap of 1.53 eV (Fig. S5†). There is a slight enhancement in the absorption coefficient, ranging from 550 nm to 810 nm, along with the introduction of 0.5% NDAPBF4 into the perovskite. This can be interpreted by the improved film quality of the perovskite, as evidenced by our SEM and XRD tests.

To examine the energy band properties of the perovskite films, a Kevin force probe microscope (KPFM) was first conducted to measure the contact potential. In this regard, the perovskite films with 0.5% NDAPBF4 generated an average surface potential of −390 mV, much larger than that of the control samples (−480 mV, Fig. 3b and S6†). The higher surface potential denoted there was an up-shift of the Fermi level in the NDAPBF4-treated perovskite film, and the scheme was further verified by ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS). As shown in Fig. 3c, the perovskite film shows a changed work function (∼90 meV) after NDAPBF4 treatment, and the band diagram is depicted in Fig. 3d. The upshifted Fermi level implies that NDAPBF4 serves as a n-type dopant in the perovskite films, which boosts the electron transportation in the perovskite films and blocks the recombination of holes from the perovskite with electrons from ETL.24–29 The effect of NDAPBF4 on the electronic states of the CsFA perovskite were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It is illustrated in Fig. 3e that the XPS peaks of Pb 4f5/2 and Pb 4f7/2 for the control perovskite films are located at 143.4 eV and 138.4 eV, respectively. By contrast, they are shifted towards larger photon energies by 50 meV in 0.5% NDAPBF4-doped perovskite films. The strong evidence confirmed that NDAPBF4 interacted with the CsFA perovskite, and induced a Fermi level shift. Similar results can be found in I 3d (Fig. S7†), which is consistent with the KPFM results.30 This fact indicates that the electrons transfer from the perovskite to NDAPBF4. It has been reported that the perovskite has a strong ionic–covalent nature. Both pyridine and cyanogen groups in NDAPBF4 can strongly react with the perovskite by sharing the electron pair with the empty orbitals of Pb2+. Accordingly, the deep traps in the perovskite induced by the Pb2+ dangling bonds are expected to be substantially reduced. It is noted that there is no F 1s peak recognized in Fig. 3f. This could be attributed to the small concentration of NDAPBF4 in the final perovskite films which is out of the sensitivity of the XPS measurement. To further verify this speculation, we performed cross-sectional EDS of TEM for 0.5% NDAPBF4 device. As shown in Fig. S8,† the F element is too low and can hardly be detected (Fig. S9†). Nevertheless, all of these results demonstrated the interaction between NDAPBF4 and the perovskite. Such interaction is expected to enhance the performance and stability of the photovoltaic devices, which will be further discussed in the following section.31,32
To investigate the influence of NDAPBF4 on the trap density of the perovskite films, the charge transfer and recombination dynamics in the CsFA perovskite films on glass were further investigated by photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra. As shown in Fig. 4a, the PL curves are centered at ∼795 and 794 nm for the control and the perovskite with 0.5% NDAPBF4, respectively. Such a small PL peak shift is related to the suppressed nonradiative recombination in the 0.5% NDAPBF4-treated perovskite films.1 This can be further demonstrated by the enhanced PL intensity for the perovskite with 0.5% NDAPBF4, which is 11 times stronger than that of the control samples. In addition, the steady-state PL was measured and is shown in Fig. S10.† The all-doped perovskite film showed enhanced PL intensity, while PL (control) < PL (2%) < PL (1%) < PL (0.5%). The increased PL intensity indicated that nonradiative recombination in the perovskite film was inhibited by NDAPBF4. The TRPL curves are depicted in Fig. 4b and fitted by bi-exponential decay equation: I(t) = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2). τ1 and τ2 are the decay time for the two PL components. τ1 is associated with the carrier nonradiative recombination at the interface, while τ2 is related to the carrier radiative recombination that mainly takes place in the bulk crystals. Based on the PL and TRPL results, we confirm that the nonradiative recombination pathways have been suppressed with the addition of NDAPBF4.

(d) Nyquist plots of the EIS curves for the control and NDAPBF4-treated devices. (e and f) TAS of the control (e) and NDAPBF4-treated perovskite films, which were deposited on quartz substrates (f). 
As mentioned Table 2 above, with the presence of NDAPBF4, the lattice orientation of the perovskite is more uniform and the grain size is steadily increased. This helps to reduce the trap states in the perovskite films. In this part, the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) was conducted based on electron-only devices with a configuration of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/PCBM/Cu to evaluate the trap density in the perovskite films. The trap density (Nt) is determined by the equation: Nt = 2εε0VTFL/eL2, where L is the thickness of the perovskite films, and e and ε0 are the elementary charge and vacuum permittivity, respectively. ε (=35) is the dielectric constant of the perovskite and VTFL represents the onset of the trap-filled limit region.33 As shown in Fig. 4c, by fitting the I–V curves, the VTFL values of the control and 0.5% NDAPBF4-doped perovskite film are determined to be 0.143 V and 0.116 V, corresponding to a trap density of 3.46 × 1015 cm−3 and 2.81 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. This fact further confirms the suppressed trap density with the addition of NDAPBF4.34 This result agrees well with our expectation that NDAPBF4 can optimize the crystallization and film-formation of the perovskite.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in the dark with frequencies ranging from 1 MHz and 1 Hz was performed to analyze the charge transfer and recombination dynamics in perovskite photovoltaic (PV) devices. Fig. 4d presents the fitted Nyquist plots of the EIS curves for the control and the PSCs with 0.5% NDAPBF4. Specifically, Rs and Rrec are the series resistance and the recombination resistance of the PV devices, respectively. The control devices give a Rs of 63.8 Ω and a Rrec of 691.5 Ω, whereas the Rs of the PSCs with 0.5% NDPABF4 is reduced to 53.6 Ω and the Rrec is promoted to 1324.2 Ω. To gain insight into the carrier profile and built-in potential, the Mott–Schottky plots for both control and 0.5% NDAPBF4 perovskite devices were provided at a frequency of 10 kHz in the dark.35,36 As shown in Fig. S11,† the flat-band potential of the devices can be directly determined by the following Mott–Schottky equation: 1/(Cs2) = 2(V − Vbi − ((kBT)/e)/qεε0Nt), where Cs is the space charge capacitance per unit area; q is the electron charge; ε and ε0 are the dielectric constant and permittivity, respectively; Nt is the carrier density, V is the bias voltage; Vbi is the built-in potential; and kB and T are the Boltzmann constant and absolute temperature, respectively. According to this equation, the built-in potential is directly related to the flat-band potential. The flat-band potential of the control and 0.5% NDAPBF4 devices are 0.34 V and 0.50 V, respectively. This higher flat-band potential of the 0.5% NDAPBF4 device is in agreement with the higher VOC.37,38 This result further demonstrates that NDAPBF4 is in favor of improving the charge transfer and suppressing the charge recombination in PSCs.39
Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) was also conducted to investigate the charge carrier transfer and recombination dynamics in the perovskite films with and without NDAPBF4. Fig. S12† displays the corresponding TA pseudo-color maps of each sample, where the relative optical density (ΔA) is changed with the wavelength and relaxation time. After excitation, a photo-bleaching (PB) band at ∼790 nm is derived, which is related to the intrinsic emission of the perovskite films. The intensity of this PB band increases in the first several hundred picoseconds (ps) as a result of the hot carrier cooling. Then, it began to quench, corresponding to the carrier relaxation to the ground state. There are two carrier recombination dynamics that dominate the PB band quenching process, i.e., radiative recombination in the time range of several hundred picoseconds and trap-assisted non-radiative recombination within several thousand picoseconds.40,41 The trap-assisted non-radiative recombination accelerates the PB quenching process, which can be used for evaluating the deep trap density in the perovskite films. As shown in Fig. 4e and f, the quenching behavior of the PB band at ∼790 nm is tracked by dashed lines. It is noted that the PB band (∼790 nm) for the control perovskite quenches with a much faster speed as it is weakened by over 15% in the time interval from 1000 to 2000 ps, while the shrinkage in the PB band is less than 10% for the perovskite with NDAPBF4. This result further verifies the passivation effect of NDAPBF4 for the deep traps in the perovskite films.42,43
It has been reported that defects in the perovskite films can activate the charge migration and deteriorate the stability of PSCs. The reduced defects by NDAPBF4 are expected to contribute to improved long-term stability for the final PSCs. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, after 1000 h storage in a glovebox, the NDAPBF4-treated PSCs without encapsulation only lose their initial efficiency of <5%, which is much less than that (>10%) of the control ones. In particular, the stability of the NDAPBF4-treated PSCs at elevated temperatures are also improved. Impressively, after being continuously annealed at 85 °C for 500 h, the unencapsulated devices with NDAPBF4 showed negligible performance loss (∼6%), whereas the PCE of the control cells descent and maintained only ∼71% of their initial efficiency. To verify the thermal stability, we presented a thermal test (250 °C 3 min) for both perovskite films via XRD. As shown in Fig. S13,† after annealing at such high temperature, the perovskite films gradually decomposed and the PbI2 peak appeared.44,45 It is obvious that the PbI2 peak intensity in the control film is significantly higher than the α-FAPbI3 perovskite phase. However, in the 0.5% NDAPBF4 perovskite film, the PbI2 peak intensity is much smaller, indicating that the thermal stability is enhanced with the addition of NDAPBF4.

The operation stability is another critical parameter for perovskite solar cells. We conducted an operational test under continuous light soaking. Fig. S14† presents the parameters of the control and 0.5% NDAPBF4 devices. It was found that the VOC showed a negligible drop (<2%), the JSC remained nearly unchanged, and the FF decreased by about 10%. So, the PCE has dropped about 13% and 8% of their initial efficiency for the control and the 0.5% NDAPBF4 perovskite devices, respectively. However, we suspected this drop mainly occurred owing to the outside testing condition (25 °C, 60–75% humidity). Similar to Walker's work, the MA-free perovskite is sensitive to water.46,47 To verify this speculation, we conducted a XRD test after exposing the perovskite films in ambient atmosphere for 24 h. As presented in Fig. S15,† after exposure, both films showed similar trends, where Cs0.05FA0.95PbI3 underwent the transformation to a more stable δ-FAPbI3 phase. This result is in accordance with a previous report.48,49
We suspect that in NDAPBF4, N-donors of the pyridine group can act as Lewis bases, which are expected to react with undercoordinated Pb2+. In this way, the perovskite film can grow with its preferable orientation with minimal Gibbs free energy, resulting in a dense and lower defect perovskite film.50,51 The enhanced stability is probably due to the larger grain sizes with reduced defect and bulk passivation effect of NDAPBF4.
Conclusion
In summary, we employed an efficient ion liquid NDAPBF4 with a pyridine group and BF4− ions to optimize the grain growth of the perovskite films, which resulted in reduced deep traps. NDAPBF4 also played as an n-type dopant, which improve the electron transportation in the perovskite. The carrier recombination at the interface of the perovskite and the ETL was thereby further suppressed. Finally, the PSCs doped with NDAPBF4 not only gave an aggressive efficiency of over 21%, but also provided a much-improved long-term stability of over 1000 h (ambient) and 500 h (85 °C). Both efficiency and stability are one of the most remarkable efficiencies up to date for the reverted MA-free PSCs. Our work helps researchers to understand the interaction between the perovskite and the ions liquids. It is emphasized that the chemical groups in the ion liquids of this work is far from being fully screened. Tailoring the chemical groups in ion liquids is expected to attract more researchers to fully explore the potentials of ion liquids in the PSC field, and is of great promise for promoting the commercialization of PSCs.
Experimental section
Materials
ITO-coated glass was purchased from Advanced Election Technology Co. Ltd., China, and the sheet resistance was measured to be 7–9 Ω sq−1. FAI was purchased form Great Cell Co., Ltd., Australia. PTAA, F4TCNQ, CsI, C60, and BCP were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp, and PbI2 (99.999%) was purchased from Ying Kou You Xuan Trade Co., Ltd. All anhydrous solvents, such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), chlorobenzene (CB), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, United States. N-Cyanogen-4-dimethylamino-pyridine tetrafluoroborate (NDAPBF4, 98%) was purchased from Meryer, China. All materials were used directly without further purification.
Devices fabrication
The ITO (15 × 15 mm2) surface was sequentially cleaned by detergent (Hellmanex III), acetone, ethanol and isopropanol twice. The cleaned substrates were dried with N2 flow and exposed under UV light for 20 min. Afterward, the PTAA solution in CB (2 mg mL−1) with 1% F4TCNQ was spin-coated to the substrates at 6000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. After cooling down to room temperature, the ITO/PTAA was washed by DMF dripping (50 μL) at 4000 rpm for 15 s to improve its wettability.
The MA-free perovskite precursor solution with a molar concentration of 1.4 M was prepared by dissolving FAI, CsI and PbI2 into 760 mg DMF and 220 mg DMSO. The chemical formula of the perovskite (i.e., Cs0.05FA0.95PbI3) was directly obtained from the molar ratio of each component in the precursor solution.
The NDAPBF4 solutions in DMF (1 M) with different volumes were directly added into the perovskite precursor to obtain a desirable doping amount.
For the fabrication of the CsFA perovskite layers, 45 μL of perovskite precursor solutions were first dripped onto the pre-wetted PTAA surface. Then, the precursor solutions on the PTAA surface were spinned at 1000 rpm for 5 s and 4000 rpm for 30 s. During this stage, 130 μL CB antisolvent was quickly dripped onto the center of the substrate at 10 s before the end. Then, the as-prepared perovskite films were transferred onto a hotplate and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. Finally, 40 nm C60, 8 nm BCP and 100 nm Cu were sequentially deposited on the perovskite film by thermal evaporation through a shadow mask with an area of 0.1 cm2. During characterization, the cell was shielded with a non-reflective mask with an active area of 0.0576 cm2.
Characterizations
The morphology of the perovskite films was obtained by SEM (TESCAN MIRA3) at a 5 kV accelerating voltage. UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded by using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 950 UV-Vis spectrometer. The steady photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were collected using a pulsed laser as an optical excitation source (A1R FLIM, Nikon). The XPS measurements were performed by using an ultraviolet photoelectron spectrometer (AXIS SUPERA X, KRATOS Scientific) at an ultrahigh vacuum of 1.0 × 10−10 torr. AFM and KPFM images of the perovskite films were collected on a multimode AM-KPFM (Bruker). Transient absorption (TA) spectra were performed by TA100 (Time-tech Spectra, Dalian). The control and NDAPBF4–perovskite were photoexcited by a pump laser pulse at 500 nm, and probed by a probe pulse of white light super continuum. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained by using the Bruker ECO D8 (Bruker, Germany) system with a Cu Kα (a wavelength of 1.5418 Å) radiation. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured under AM 1.5 G one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2) with a solar simulator (Enlitech SS-F7-3A) equipped with a 300 W xenon lamp and a Keithley 2400 source meter in ambient atmosphere (40%–60% humidity). The light intensity was adjusted by an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured under ambient atmosphere at room temperature using a DSR100UV-B spectrometer with an SR830 lock-in amplifier.
