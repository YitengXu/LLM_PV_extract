The results highlight the potential application of this organic–inorganic integrated HTL in OSCs.
1 Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted much attention in the past few decades due to their various advantages such as low cost, light weight, flexibility, and potential to be developed into large-area modules by a solution processing method.1–14 With the rapid progress in light harvesting materials and interfacial engineering, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 12% have been achieved in single-junction OSCs.5,15–20 Besides the design and synthesis of narrow-bandgap polymer materials with higher absorption coefficients and charge mobilities, interfacial engineering provides a powerful strategy to enhance the efficiency and stability of OSCs.7–9,11,21–29 Hole transport materials (HTMs) play an important role in both extracting and transporting the photogenerated holes from the polymer materials to the anode, thus suppressing undesired recombination losses at the interfaces. Hence, the development of efficient HTMs has emerged as one of the hottest research areas in the field of OSCs. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate acid) (PEDOT:PSS) has been the most commonly used anode interfacial material to date, particularly for the fabrication of conventional structured OSCs. However, previous studies have demonstrated that the weak acidity and low charge-carrier mobility of PEDOT:PSS significantly limit its potential for up-scaled applications of OSCs. Furthermore, samples of this material will re-absorb water if they are not used immediately.30–32 Therefore, it is of great importance to explore alternative HTMs with low cost, facile synthesis and high charge-carrier mobility relative to PEDOT:PSS. Recently, stable and easily-synthesized metal oxides, including molybdenum oxide (MoO3), nickel oxide (NiOx), tungsten oxide (WO3) and copper oxide (CuOx), have been developed as HTMs.33–35 Among them, CuOx shows advantages including p-type conductivity, better conductivity and good electron-blocking ability.36,37 In our previous work, we investigated thoroughly a p-type copper-based oxide with mobility as high as 10−2–101 cm2 V−1 s−1 and fabricated OSCs with it as a HTM whose holes are induced by Cu vacancies and O interstitial defects. We also demonstrated that Cu2O is a very promising HTM candidate for improving the photovoltaic performance and fabricating cost effective OSCs.38
However, defects such as Cu vacancies (VCu) and oxygen interstitials (Oi) are always present at the surface of Cu2O and act as charge traps leading to the possibility of recombination of the photogenerated charges thus causing the degradation of the stability of solar cells. Another well-known feature of Cu2O defect states is their sensitivity to several adsorbates like oxygen species, which are always present in air-processed Cu2O films and have a negative impact on the photostability of the resulting solar cell. To address these issues, here, we attempt to explore an ultrathin layer of semicrystalline 5,6-difluorobenzothiadiazole based conjugated polymer FBT-TH4 to join with Cu2O. Although conjugated polymer FBT-TH4 has been extensively used as a p-type semiconductor in thin film field effect transistors and as the donor of polymer material PV devices due to favorable properties such as high hole mobility, as well as excellent thermal and chemical stability, its successful application in inorganic p-type hole transport materials has never been explored to the best of our knowledge.39,40
In this study, we employ an ultrathin layer of conjugated polymer FBT-TH4, as an interfacial modification layer to reengineer the surface of the sputter processed Cu2O HTM. Relevant measurements reveal that the Cu2O/FBT-TH4 HTM showed increased hole mobility and an up-shift in WF, which are crucial for enhancing the hole collection from the active layer to the anode. The optimized average PCE of Cu2O/FBT-TH4 based OSCs achieved a maximum of 9.56%, which shows a significant enhancement in PCE compared with that of the untreated Cu2O hole transport layer (HTL) or PEDOT:PSS based OSCs. Our results show the great potential of FBT-TH4 modified Cu2O for fabricating highly efficient and low-cost OSCs.
2 Results and discussion
The optical properties of ITO glass covered with the anode buffer layer were determined using optical transmittance measurements. As shown in Fig. 1a, it can be seen clearly that the Cu2O layer with high optical transmittance will not cause additional loss of photons. Meanwhile, the additional FBT-TH4 layer does not significantly compromise the number of photons being absorbed by the photoactive layer.

The electrical properties of different anode buffer layers play an important role in determining the charge transfer and charge collection in OSCs. To estimate the electrical conductivities of Cu2O and Cu2O/FBT-TH4 thin films, the J–V characteristics of the device with a structure of ITO/Cu2O (or Cu2O/FBT-TH4) HTM/Au were investigated. As shown in Fig. 1b, the linear dependence J–V curves imply a well formed ohmic contact. The electrical conductivity of the Cu2O thin film and Cu2O/FBT-TH4 thin film is estimated to be 3.02 × 10−3 and 4.69 × 10−3 S cm−1, respectively. Compared with the pristine Cu2O film, such high electrical conductivity of the Cu2O/FBT-TH4 ultrathin film would facilitate charge transport and reduce the series resistance for OSCs.
The surface of the Cu2O film becomes relatively smoother with FBT-TH4 layer modification, as shown in the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of Fig. 1c. The root-mean square (RMS) roughness (Rq) of the Cu2O HTL is 7.1 nm while that of the Cu2O/FBT-TH4 HTL is just 1.9 nm, which is consistent with the SEM images (Fig. S1, ESI†). The SEM morphology are an untreated Cu2O film and a FBT-TH4 modified Cu2O HTL surface fabricated from 1 mg mL−1 FBT-TH4 solution, respectively. No obvious Cu2O crystals and only a smooth surface can be detected using SEM.
We applied ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) to measure the work function of the Cu2O surface. The work functions of the untreated and FBT-TH4 treated Cu2O surfaces are −4.98 and −5.08 eV, respectively. The valence band (VB) edges of Cu2O and FBT-TH4 treated Cu2O have been determined to be 5.20 and 5.25 eV below the vacuum level, respectively (Fig. S2, ESI†). It was found that the WF of the Cu2O/FBT-TH4 layer is very close to the HOMO of the active layers. It is expected that a smaller energy level offset between the active layer and the anode will be formed when Cu2O/FBT-TH4 was used as the anode buffer layer. It is well known that the small energy level offset is beneficial for the charge carrier extraction. Therefore, Cu2O/FBT-TH4 will play a better bridging role in the cascade energy level sequence thus facilitating charge transfer more than a single Cu2O layer. The formation of Cu2O was also confirmed by X-ray diffraction data and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Fig. S3, ESI†).

Fig. 2a shows the device architecture of a regular OSC based on FBT-TH4 treated Cu2O and the corresponding energy band diagram relative to the vacuum level. More details regarding the solar cell fabrication procedures and component parameters are described in the ESI.† The best performance was found when the thickness of Cu2O is 25 nm (Fig. S4 and Table S1, ESI†). Optimizations of the concentration of the FBT-TH4 and the PDINO layer suggested that 1 mg mL−1 and 1 mg mL−1 contributed to the best device performance, respectively (Fig. S5, S6 and Tables S2, S3, ESI†). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the champion cell based on the untreated Cu2O HTM and the Cu2O/FBT-TH4 HTM are shown (Fig. 2b). The OSC using the untreated Cu2O HTM shows a JSC of 16.00 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.76 V, an FF of 69.8%, and a PCE of 8.48%. The best photovoltaic performance of devices with Cu2O/FBT-TH4 HTMs achieves a JSC of 17.5 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.77 V, an FF of 70.7 and an enhanced PCE of 9.56%. The PCE obtained is also much higher than that of the reference device based on the most commonly used HTM, PEDOT:PSS, which exhibits a maximum average PCE of 8.2% (Fig. S7, ESI†). Meanwhile, a significant difference in JSC was observed when comparing OSCs based on pristine Cu2O and FBT-TH4 modified Cu2O. Considering the same fabrication procedure for all of the other layers, a possible reason may be related to the HOMO energy level and the morphology of the HTM. Fig. 2c shows the histogram of the PCEs obtained from over 100 cells with the untreated Cu2O and FBT-TH4 treated Cu2O as the HTMs. The histogram of the VOC, JSC, and FF is exhibited in Fig. S8 in the ESI.† The average PCE is 9.42% with an average JSC of 17.42 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.77 V, and an FF of 0.70, respectively (Table 1). In addition, the effect of the FBT-TH4 ultrathin layer with different thicknesses on the device performance is further investigated. Fig. S5 and Table S2 (ESI†) list device performance parameters of the OSCs with the Cu2O/FBT-TH4 HTMs, where the thickness of FBT-TH4 is different. This is expected to optimize the charge transport through reengineering the thicknesses of the layers. Excessive thicknesses of FBT-TH4 drastically increase the internal series resistance while an extremely thin FBT-TH4 layer leads to poor coverage over the surface of Cu2O. The optimum concentration of ultrathin FBT-TH4 was determined as 1 mg mL−1, which is the compromise of passivation of the surface trap states, and external conductivity for charge transport. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are shown in Fig. 2d, and by integrating the EQE spectra, JSC values of 15.45 and 16.98 mA cm−2 are estimated from the device using the Cu2O and Cu2O/FBT-TH4 HTMs, respectively. These integrated JSC values are in good agreement with those observed from the J–V characteristics. Note that the slight difference in JSC obtained using different methods is probably due to the imperfect solar spectrum of different solar simulators.

To understand the contribution from the FBT-TH4 polymer to the ameliorated charge transport properties within the solar cells, we further study the hole mobility and transient photocurrent response in the OSCs. The hole-only devices with an architecture of ITO/HTM/PffBT4T-2OD:PC71BM/Au are processed and tested. Fig. 3a shows the plot of the J1/2versus (Vappl − Vbi) characteristic in the space charge limited region, and Child's law is further employed to obtain the hole mobilities for both devices. The BHJ composite from the OSCs with Cu2O possesses a hole mobility of 2.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, whereas the BHJ composite from the inverted device using Cu2O/FBT-TH4 exhibits a hole mobility of 7.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The higher hole mobilities of the Cu2O/FBT-TH4-based devices decreased the probability of exciton recombination and resulted in the increased JSC values, which is in agreement with the photovoltaic parameters displayed in Table 1. The impedance spectra are further applied to study the underlying charge transport physics in the OSCs with different HTLs. The RS incorporates the sheet resistance (RSheet) and the charge transfer resistance (RCT). The RSheet is correlated with the electrodes, and the RCT is correlated with the resistance at the interface between the electrodes and the charge extraction layers, the charge extraction layers and BHJ photoactive layer, and inside of the BHJ photoactive layer. In this work, the difference in RCT is only at the interface between the HTM and the BHJ photoactive layer. Fig. 3b shows the Nyquist plots of the OSCs with the Cu2O and the Cu2O/FBT-TH4 HTLs. Smaller RCT from the OSCs using the Cu2O/FBT-TH4 HTL indicates that the charge transfer properties within the OSCs have been improved by employing the Cu2O/FBT-TH4 HTL. The reduced resistance in the OSCs using the Cu2O/FBT-TH4 HTL can be ascribed to the optimized interface between the HTL and active layer. Incorporation of the polymer FBT-TH4 can contribute to passivation of the trap states of inorganic Cu2O and help enable intimate contact between the HTM and the active layer. Furthermore, the FBT-TH4 ultrathin layer also benefits the charge behavior extraction owing to the reduced energy barrier induced by the enhanced hole mobility modification effect.

To visualize the role of the FBT-TH4 modification layer in the diode, we employ the general single exponential diode equation (in the dark, the light-induced current JSC = 0) of (1) (2) (3)where J is the current flowing through the external circuit, J0 is the dark saturation current density, A is the ideality factor, KB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, RS is the series resistance, G is the shunt conductance, and V is the applied bias. Fig. 3c shows the derivative G(V) = dJ/dV. G(V) becomes flat with the value in reverse bias close to the region of the short circuit where the derivative term is negligible. The G of the OSCs using the Cu2O/FBT-TH4 HTM is 1.25 mS cm−2, which is smaller than that of 1.38 mS cm−2 of the device using the Cu2O HTM. The smaller G corresponds to a reduced internal leakage current throughout the devices. Fig. 3e presents R(J) = −dV/dJ versus (JSC − J)−1, rendering R by linear fitting. A smaller RS of 1.8 Ω cm2 in the OSCs with the Cu2O/FBT-TH4 HTM indicates an enhanced charge transport process within the devices, which is in agreement with the parameters displayed in Fig. 3b. By employing the plot of J + JSC − GV versus (V − RJ) with the RS obtained from Fig. 3f, the J0 for different devices is estimated. The linear region, as shown in Fig. 3f, suggests a good fitting with the equation. The OSCs with the Cu2O/FBT-TH4 HTM show a dramatically reduced J0 of 7.5 × 10−5 mA cm−2 compared with 1.6 × 10−4 mA cm−2 from the device using the Cu2O HTM. The dramatically reduced J0 indicates reduced leakage current and thus minimized charge carrier recombination along with the hole pathways from the BHJ photoactive layer to the anode. We think that Cu2O plays a core role in inorganic–organic integrated Cu2O/FBT-TH4 HTMs, although Cu2O is somewhat better than most used PEDOT:PSS HTMs in terms of efficiency and stability. However it still has room for further improvement on the basis of its shortcomings. Based on its inherent p type conductivity, defects such as Cu vacancies (VCu) and oxygen interstitials (Oi) inevitably occur at the interface. Meanwhile, the strong diffusion ability of copper ions will also affect the long-term stability of the active layer, and the FBT-TH4 ultrathin layer plays a role in improving the interfacial smoothness, reducing the interfacial exciton recombination center and preventing ion diffusion. We also test the performance of the device with bare FBT-TH4 in Fig. S9 (ESI†); the champion PCE is 7.8%, and the efficiency is even lower than our PEDOT:PSS based device, which is mainly restricted to VOC and FF. This may be due to the lower LUMO of FBT-TH4 (3.7 eV) as mentioned in the literature.
As shown in Fig. 4, the stabilities of the untreated Cu2O and Cu2O/FBT-TH4-based OSCs were compared by exposing them directly to the ambient environment at 25 °C and with 20% humidity without encapsulation. The statistical data of the decay of the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S4 (ESI†). The PCE of the Cu2O/FBT-TH4-based device maintained the majority (75%) of the original device performance up to 30 d, whereas that of the untreated Cu2O-based device decayed dramatically from ≈8.5% to 4.5% within the first week. Similarly, the JSC, VOC, and FF values for the organic HTL-based device suffer a substantial degradation during the aging process as shown in Fig. 4b–d. The results show the advantages of using the Cu2O/FBT-TH4 HTL for the enhancement of the lifetime of the derived devices. As we know, the surface wettability of the HTM is an important factor that significantly affects the stability of PVSCs. The higher stability of the Cu2O/FBT-TH4 device was attributed to the high hydrophobicity of FBT-TH4. The contact angle tests showed that ITO/PEDOT:PSS and ITO/Cu2O exhibited a contact angle of 23.0° and 36.5° to water droplets (Fig. S10, ESI†). As a sharp contrast, after deposition of FBT-TH4, the Cu2O/FBT-TH4 sample exhibited a much larger contact angle of 105.1°. Such a hydrophobic HTL would ease the protection of moisture in air and is beneficial for long-term stability, which is different from PEDOT:PSS, since its feature of reabsorbing water, we might spin active layer as soon as possible.

3 Conclusions
In summary, organic–inorganic integrated HTLs consisting of the solution-processable FBT-TH4 and Cu2O have been successfully incorporated into conventional structured OSCs. By introducing the ultrathin layer of conjugated polymer FBT-TH4 on top of a compact Cu2O layer, an upward WF has been demonstrated for the Cu2O/FBT-TH4 integrated HTM film. The optimized Cu2O/FBT-TH4 integrated HTL based OSCs display an impressive average PCE of 9.56% under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G illumination, which is superior to that of the reference devices based on PEDOT:PSS HTM (8.2%) and higher than that of devices based on the untreated Cu2O HTLs (8.4%). Remarkably, it was found that the employment of Cu2O/FBT-TH4 as the HTL significantly improved the long-term stability of OSCs. This Cu2O/FBT-TH4 HTL can provide great potential for the low cost and simple fabrication of high performance OSCs.
