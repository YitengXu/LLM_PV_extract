    , Accepted 24th May 2019First published on 24th May 2019AbstractThe electrochemical conversion of CO2 to fuels or chemicals is an attractive approach that can combine sustainable energy utilization and carbon recycling, but its practicability is still vague, because the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has hitherto been mostly studied in electrolyte solutions, with small current densities limited by the solubility of CO2. An important and urgent task is thus to develop CO2 electrolyzers that can demonstrate the feasibility of the large-scale conversion of CO2, in particular analogs of water electrolyzers using polymer electrolyte based gas-diffusion electrodes. Here we report a high-performance CO2 electrolyzer making use of alkaline polymer electrolytes (APEs). A highly conductive and stable APE, quaternary ammonia poly(N-methyl-piperidine-co-p-terphenyl) (QAPPT), was applied both as the membrane separator and the ionomer impregnating the gas-diffusion electrodes. Dry CO2 was fed into the Au cathode, with a faradaic efficiency of CO production (COFE) over 85%, and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurred at the IrO2 anode fed with pure water. The cell was operated at temperatures up to 80 °C, and the current density reached 0.5 A cm−2 at 3 V at 60 °C. The stability of this electrolyzer was tested under 0.1 A cm−2, and the cell voltage remained stable at 2.25 V over 100 h, with the COFE staying at 90–95%.

Broader context
Electrochemical reduction of CO2, to liquid fuels or valuable chemicals, is an energetically reasonable approach, because the electrochemical conversion can make use of solar electricity. However, the practicability of this approach has been questioned; a strong concern is that the solubility of CO2 in electrolytes is too low (ca. 40 mmol L−1) to supply industrial-scale production. The solution is to apply gas-diffusion electrodes (GDEs), in particular making use of polymer electrolytes, analogous to the case of polymer electrolyte fuel cells and polymer electrolyte water electrolysis. The difficulty is that Nafion, the popular acidic polyelectrolyte, cannot be applied in this case, because the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is strongly favored over the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) in acidic media. Alkaline polymer electrolytes (APEs) are thus highly expected to be employed for CO2 electrolysis, but highly conductive and stable APEs have not been available until recently. In this report, we demonstrate the first implementation of CO2 electrolyzers fully based on APEs without adding any alkaline solution. Industrial-scale current densities are hereby achieved, such as 500 mA cm−2@3 V at 60 °C, with a CO faradaic efficiency over 90%. This result manifests that CO2 conversion under mild conditions is now becoming a practically feasible technology.

Introduction
The electrochemical conversion of CO2 to fuels or chemicals was actually an old subject initiated decades ago.1,2 Research interest has been elevated to a high level in recent years,3–7 mostly driven by the increasing concerns on the global energy crisis and environmental issues, and also due to the technological improvement in harvesting regenerative energy, such as solar/wind power.8 The electrochemical conversion of CO2 is such an approach that can combine sustainable energy utilization and carbon recycling.2,9 Only when the applied power source comes from sustainable energy can CO2 conversion be meaningful, for CO2 is the final oxidation product of fossil-fuel consumption and reducing CO2 back to hydrocarbons is highly endothermic.1,3 Even powered by sustainable energy, however, the practicability of this approach seems to be still vague,10–12 as the rate of the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) would be limited by the sluggish kinetics and the low solubility of CO2 in solutions.13
To boost the rate of the CO2RR is thus the key for change. Beside exploring new catalysts with high catalytic activity and selectivity,14–18 the technique of gas-diffusion electrodes (GDEs) must be employed.18–21 Considering the fact that, although the solubility of H2 in water is less than 10% of the CO2 solubility,22 the current density of a H2 fuel cell can reach an order of magnitude of A cm−2,23 there is, therefore, no reason that the rate of the CO2RR has to be limited by the CO2 solubility, provided a GDE for the CO2RR can be realized. More and more research efforts have been devoted to the CO2 electrolyzer,24–29 where CO2 is reduced at the GDE-based cathode and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurs at the anode. The performance of these preliminary CO2 electrolyzers is promising, with the current density exceeding 0.1 A cm−2,30–35 but the cell voltage is still large,31–33 and liquid electrolytes are still used/involved in these devices.33–35
For modern fuel cells or electrolyzers, using polymer electrolytes is a superior technique over liquid electrolytes.36–38 Polymer electrolyte membranes (PEMs) are of lower gas permeability than porous diaphragms impregnated with liquid electrolytes; the gap between electrodes can thus be minimized, enabling large current densities with small ohmic loss. Furthermore, PEMs are less corrosive than liquid electrolytes, which simplifies the device operation and maintenance.36,38 Thus far, however, reports on PEM-based CO2 electrolyzers have still been limited, and the performance was still lower than that of flow cells using liquid electrolytes.31,39 This is because an appropriate PEM for the CO2 electrolyzer had not yet been found/tested. The widely-applied acidic polymer electrolyte, typically Nafion, is not suitable for this case, because the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is much more favorable than the CO2RR in acidic media.25 In other words, the intended CO2 electrolysis in acids will, to a large extent, become water electrolysis. Typical liquid electrolytes used for CO2RR study are alkaline solutions (e.g., KHCO3 or KOH solution),1,20 but corresponding alkaline polymer electrolytes (APEs), with high ionic conductivity and chemical stability, have not been available until recently.40–42 Developing an APE CO2 electrolyzer was attempted,31 but the cell performance was low due to the lack of a high-performance APE at that time, and thus diluted KHCO3 solution was still applied to enhance the ionic conduction.
In the present work, we report a high-performance CO2 electrolyzer fully based on APEs without adding any alkaline solution. A cationic polymer, quaternary ammonia poly(N-methyl-piperidine-co-p-terphenyl) (QAPPT) (see Table S1 for key properties, ESI†),43,44 was here applied as both the membrane and the ionomer impregnated inside the electrodes. Originally developed in our lab for alkaline polymer electrolyte fuel cells (APEFCs),44,45 QAPPT features high ionic conductivity and chemical/mechanical stability.43 For the sake of simplicity, we used common catalysts for the cathode and the anode reactions, namely Au/C (homemade, Fig. S1–S3, ESI†) or cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc, commercial) for the CO2RR, and IrO2 (commercial) for the OER. Pure CO2 was directly fed into the cathode without humidification, and the reaction products, CO and H2 in this case, were analyzed using on-line gas chromatography (GC). In order to make the APE ionically conductive and to enable the OER at the anode, deionized water (18 MΩ cm) was necessary, which flowed from a water reservoir at an elevated position into the anode chamber without the use of a driving pump (Fig. S4, ESI†). Note that no alkaline solution was added to the water reservoir. Such an APE CO2 electrolyzer, operated with pure water, can deliver industrial-scale current densities, e.g., 500 mA cm−2@3 V at 60 °C.
Results and discussion
The cell structure and working mechanism
As illustrated in Fig. 1a, the APE CO2 electrolyzer consists of two graphite backplates and the core component, the membrane-electrode assembly (MEA), which itself comprises five layers. The gas-diffusion layer (GDL) at the cathode side is hydrophobic carbon paper (AvCard GDS3250, Ballard), while the GDL at the anode side is a porous Ti sheet (Fig. S5, ESI†). A cathodic catalyst layer (3.2 cm2 in geometric area), impregnated with QAPPT ionomer (20 wt%), was sprayed onto the QAPPT membrane (Fig. 1b & Fig. S6, ESI†), while a QAPPT-impregnated IrO2 catalyst layer was deposited onto the anode GDL (Fig. S7, ESI†). These five layers were pressed together to form the MEA, with the gap between the two electrodes being ca. 30 μm.

(a) Structural illustration of the APE CO2 electrolyzer, operated with dry CO2 in the cathode and pure water in the anode. (b) A cross-section SEM image of the core component, the cathode Au/C catalyst layer on the APE membrane (APEM). (c) The OH− percentage in the APEM (OH%) as a function of the CO2 stoichiometry in the cathode, calculated based on the CO2 crossover from the cathode to the anode, measured by GC. Dash lines represent the upper limit of HCO3−/OH− or CO32−/OH−, the realistic OH% is located in the shadow region. The CO2 stoichiometry was changed by varying the current density while keeping the CO2 flow rate at 100 sccm. 
The initial charge carrier of the as-prepared APE was OH−. In operation, the CO2 at the cathode would be in excess, i.e., the CO2 flow rate would be greater than the CO2RR rate, hence the APE will be carbonated to some degree, and parts of the charge carrier will be replaced by CO32−/HCO3−: CO2 + OH− = HCO3−(R1) CO2 + 2OH− = CO32− + H2O(R2)
Therefore, the OH− percentage (OH%) in the APE membrane (APEM) depends on the CO2 stoichiometry at the cathode (i.e., the ratio between the flow rate and the consumption rate), which can be estimated by detecting the amount of CO2 crossover/leak at the anode side (see the anodic reactions in Table 1). Fig. 1c displays such results. Although the exact CO32−/HCO3− ratio in the APEM is unknown, the limits can be determined and are presented as the dash lines in the figure. The realistic OH% is thus within the shadow region. Clearly, when the CO2 flow rate is 10 times the CO2RR rate, the OH% will be close to 80%.

Anodic reactions:a
4OH− = O2 + 2H2O + 4e− (major)


4HCO3− = O2 + 4CO2 + 2H2O + 4e−


2CO32− = O2 + 2CO2 + 4e−


Cell reactions:
2CO2 = 2CO + O2 (major)


2H2O = 2H2 + O2




Under realistic operating conditions, the CO2 stoichiometry at the cathode is usually less than 10, thus the APE carbonation and the CO2 crossover are minor (below 1 μL min−1 cm−2), and the major charge carrier is still OH−, in particular under large current densities (hundreds of mA cm−2, vide infra). Such a relatively strong alkaline environment, in comparison to KHCO3 solutions, was thought to be beneficial to the CO2RR over the HER.34,35 Furthermore, without the use of KOH or KHCO3 solutions, there is no need to worry about any carbonate precipitate that can break the water-proof cathode and fail the cell operation.34 This unique feature secures the long-term operation and facilitates the maintenance of the APE CO2 electrolyzer.
The cell performance
By using the GDE technique, the current density is no longer limited by the CO2 solubility in water. As demonstrated in Fig. 2a, the current density of the APE CO2 electrolyzer operated at 60 °C increases continuously with the cell voltage, reaching 0.5 A cm−2 at 3.0 V, no longer limited by the solubility of CO2, as is the case for the CO2RR taking place in carbonate solutions (Fig. S8, ESI†). The faradaic efficiency of CO production (COFE) of the APE CO2 electrolyzer remains greater than 85% when the cell voltage is above 2.0 V (Fig. 2b), and the optimal energy efficiency region appears at 2.0–2.4 V, where the COFE reaches 95%. To demonstrate the applicability of non-precious metal catalysts for the CO2RR, CoPc was also tested as the cathode catalyst. As shown in Fig. 2c and d, the current density reaches 200 mA cm−2 at 2.8 V, with the COFE above 90%.
 Fig. 2  Cell performance of the APE CO2 electrolyzer. Two kinds of cathode catalyst were applied, i.e., Au (a and b) and CoPc (c and d). I–V curves (a and c) were recorded at 60 °C, and the faradaic efficiencies of CO and H2 production (denoted as COFE and H2FE, respectively) and the energy efficiency (b and d) were calculated based on the GC results, as a function of the applied cell voltage. The Au loading in the cathode was 0.4 mg cm−2, while the CoPc loading was 0.2 mg cm−2. The electrode geometric area was 3.2 cm2, and the CO2 flow rate was fixed at 100 sccm. 
Also revealed in Fig. 2a and b is that, at cell voltages lower than 2.0 V, the current density and the COFE are relatively low but increase rapidly, implying that this is the activation region for the CO2RR. Such a judgement is supported by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), which unravels that the charge-transfer resistance at 1.7 V is five times that at 2.1 V (Fig. S9, ESI†). Therefore, it can be concluded that, for a CO2 electrolyzer to work efficiently, the cell should be operated at a voltage above 2.0 V. Further increasing the cell voltage will result in greater current densities but at the expense of losing the energy efficiency, in particular at voltages above 2.5 V.
When the cell voltage is above 2.0 V, the I–V curve appears to be linear (Fig. 2a), indicating that the rates of the anodic and cathodic reactions are sufficiently high and the I–V response is dominated by the ohmic resistance of the electrolyzer. The current density of the present CO2 electrolyzer can be boosted to an even higher level on further increasing the cell voltage (over 0.7 A cm−2, see Fig. S10, ESI†), since there is no sign of limitation caused by the mass transport (CO2 supply). The above results unambiguously manifest that it is no problem at all for the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to be implemented in a large-scale and efficient fashion, provided the CO2 electrolyzer is realized with appropriate GDE designs and advanced APEs.
The temperature-dependent performance and efficiency
To further determine the optimal operation temperature of this APE CO2 electrolyzer, the cell presented in Fig. 2a was evaluated under 0.1 A cm−2 at different temperatures, so as to see how the cell voltage and the COFE change with the temperature. As shown in Fig. 3a, when the operation temperature increases from 30 °C to 80 °C, the cell voltage decreases from 2.5 V to 2.2 V, whereas the COFE declines from 96% to 72%. The reduction in the cell voltage upon increasing the temperature should be the kinetic effects of both the electrode reactions and the ionic conduction. As revealed by the impedance spectra (Fig. 3b), the high-frequency resistance (HFR) is reduced by less than 0.4 Ω cm2 upon the temperature elevation, corresponding to a voltage reduction of only 0.04 V (i.e., 0.1 A cm−2 × 0.4 Ω cm2). In other words, the overall cell voltage change of 0.3 V was mainly a result of the improvement in the reaction kinetics rather than the ionic conduction, which can also be confirmed from the shrinking of the semi-circles in the impedance spectra (Fig. 3b).
 Fig. 3  The APE CO2 electrolyzer working at different temperatures. (a) The temperature dependent cell voltage and CO selectivity under a current density of 0.1 A cm−2. The Au loading in the cathode was 0.4 mg cm−2, and the CO2 flow rate was fixed at 100 sccm. (b) AC impedance spectra recorded at open-circuit voltage, the inset magnifies the high frequency region to show the change of ionic conduction with temperature. 
The decline in the COFE upon temperature elevation (Fig. 3a) reflects the change in the catalytic selectivity between the CO2RR and the HER. Apparently, the CO2RR is favorable over the HER on the Au cathode, implying that the apparent activation energy of the HER is greater than that of the CO2RR in this case, although the HER is thermodynamically favorable. The greater the activation energy, the more the reaction benefited from the temperature elevation. It is thus reasonable that at higher temperature the COFE decreases to some degree, since the HER enhances to a greater extent. Considering the cell voltage and the COFE, the optimal operation temperature for the present APE CO2 electrolyzer is 50–60 °C, whereby the COFE is above 90% and the cell voltage is less than 2.3 V.
The stability test
The APE CO2 electrolyzer using the Au cathode was then tested at 50 °C for an elongated period of time to check the stability. As displayed in Fig. 4a, during the 100 hour test, the cell voltage slightly decreases from 2.30 V to 2.25 V (i.e., a slight increase in energy efficiency), which may be due to the gradual activation of the MEA (e.g., hypothetically, the ionic pathway at the electrode/polyelectrolyte interface was gradually optimized), a usual phenomenon observed in polymer electrolyte fuel cells. The gas product of the cathode was sampled intermittently for GC analysis, which showed that the COFE remained stable at 90–95% during the test (Fig. 4a). The Au/C catalyst and the APE were examined before and after this durability test, so as to check if there was any change in the materials. As indicated by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations (Fig. 4b), there was no observable change in the particle size (∼11 nm, estimated by the Scherrer equation) and the morphology of the Au catalyst after the 100 hour test. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to monitor the ratio between the quaternary ammonia (+NR4, ∼403.5 eV) and amine (NR3, ∼400.0 eV) components of the APE membrane (Fig. 4c), and it turned out that the degradation of the cationic group was less than 5% during the 100 hour operation. In addition, 1H NMR was employed to analyze both the accumulated water in the anode water reservoir, and the condensed water vapor evaporated from the cathode, so as to detect any possible liquid product produced during the long-time electrolysis, such as formic acid and alcohols. It turned out that the liquid products, if any, were negligible and below the detection limits (Fig. S11, ESI†). This is consistent with the previous knowledge that Au highly selectively catalyzes CO2 reduction to produce CO.4,15,34

Conclusion
We report on a successful implementation of APE CO2 electrolyzers that can deliver industrial-scale current densities. A stable APE, QAPPT, was used both as the membrane separator and the ionomer impregnated in the gas diffusion electrodes. Different from previous designs operated with alkaline solutions, a compact MEA structure was here realized with the gap between the two electrodes significantly reduced to 30 μm, and the CO2 crossover was found to be negligible under realistic operation conditions. Operated with dry CO2 in the cathode and pure water in the anode, the APE CO2 electrolyzer exhibited high performance and stability. At 60 °C, the current density climbed from 0.1 A cm−2 at 2.2 V to 0.5 A cm−2 at 3 V, with the COFE ranging from 85% to 95%. A low-cost cathode catalyst, CoPc, was also applicable and delivered remarkable cell performance. Free from alkaline solutions, the cell assembly, operation, and maintenance are simplified, and the lab device ran stably in a period of testing over 100 hours. The performance of the present APE CO2 electrolyzer represents one of the highest performances reported in the literature (Table 2), manifesting that it is practically possible for the CO2RR to be realized at an industrial scale. Our findings represent notable progress in the technology of electrochemical conversion of CO2.

Experimental details
Materials
The synthesis of the alkaline polymer electrolyte (APE), QAPPT, has been reported in our previous work.43,44 The Au/C catalyst (Au content ∼40 wt%) was synthesized in the following procedure: 28 mg carbon black (Vulcan XC-72, Cabot) was dispersed in 60 mL glycerol by stirring and sonication, then HAuCl4 (0.1 mM) and excess NaBH4 (about a 15 times equivalent amount) were dissolved individually in 2 mL water and added dropwise to the mixture with heating to 50 °C and stirring for 2 h, and the black wet precipitate was washed with water and ethanol repeatedly after centrifugation, followed by freeze drying overnight. IrO2, KOH, KHCO3 and CoPc (≥90%) were purchased from Aladdin and Macklin, and used directly without further purification; all other reagent-grade chemicals were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., China. Ultrapure water (Millipore, 18.2 MΩ) was used in all experiments. The CoPc powder was simply mixed with Vulcan XC-72 (CoPc content ∼20 wt%) before use. To prepare catalyst inks, the composition was controlled to 4 mg catalyst (Au/C, CoPc/C, or IrO2) with 1 mg QAPPT ionomer dissolved in 1 mL ethanol before sonicating to a stable and well-dispersed mixture. The catalyst loading was then calculated according to the actual catalyst ink usage.
Characterization
The synthesized Au/C powder was characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, TA Instruments) to estimate the actual Au content (Fig. S1, ESI†), with temperature ramping from room temperature to 800 °C at 10 °C min−1 under a 20 sccm air stream. The TEM characterization was carried out via a JEOL-2100 transmission electron microscope with a 200 kV acceleration voltage, and all SEM images were collected using a Zeiss Merlin Compact scanning electron microscope. The XRD spectra were obtained on a Rigaku MiniFlex-600 diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (40 kV, λ = 1.5406 Å), and the average size of Au NPs could be estimated by the empirical Scherrer formula from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (220) peak. All XPS spectra were obtained using an ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer using monochromatic Al Kα excitation.
Electrochemistry
Regular CO2 reduction tests were carried out in an H-type electrolytic cell with three electrodes, where the working and counter electrode compartments were separated by a QAPPT membrane. The Au/C ink was dropped and dried on glassy carbon (∼0.8 cm2) and served as the working electrode, and the counter and reference electrode were a Pt sheet and a freshly made reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE in 0.1M KOH, connected with a luggin capillary and leak-free frit, and calibrated using a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) in advance), respectively. Electrochemical reduction of CO2 was conducted using a CHI-720E (CH Instruments) in CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 (pH = 6.8) with vigorous stirring, and the reported electrode potentials were converted to the corresponding RHE reference scale using E (pH = 6.8) = E (pH = 13) − 0.0591 × 6.2, where 6.2 is the pH difference in KOH and CO2 saturated KHCO3.
For the APE electrolyzer, the catalyst loadings were set to 0.4 mg cm−2, 0.2 mg cm−2 and 2 mg cm−2 for Au, CoPc, and IrO2, respectively, in all experiments, with an effective geometric area of 3.2 cm2 (18 mm × 18 mm) in the center of the membrane (40 mm × 40 mm). The IrO2 thin layer was deposited onto the Ti GDL (20 mm × 20 mm, 1 mm thick) just for easier reuse in multiple tests. Soft silicone gaskets were used to ensure gas tightness and insulation. All the transient cyclic voltammetry (CV), steady-state chronopotentiometry, and AC electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted using a potentiostat (Ivium Technology) with a two-electrode setup and without iR correction, and EIS data were acquired from 1 to 10 kHz under an applied DC bias with 10 mV AC amplitude.
The energy efficiency of the cell reaction (2CO2 = 2CO + O2) is defined by the ratio between the theoretical enthalpy change (ΔH = 283 kJ mol−1) and the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) that practically occurred:12,32  where ΔG can be calculated by multiplying the applied cell voltage E, the reaction electron number n, and the faradaic constant F. The total energy efficiency (EE) of the CO2 electrolyzer (red curves in Fig. 2b and d) has to take into account the faradaic efficiency of the CO production (COFE), in competition with the H2 production, and is thus calculated as:EE = η × COFE
Detection
The cathode gaseous products were analyzed through a downstream sampling loop of a gas chromatograph (GC, Shimadzu GC-2010 plus) equipped with Barrier Discharge Ionization (BID) detector and a ShinCarbon column (Restek) in all experiments. High purity helium (99.999%) was used as the carrier gas. The flow rate of input CO2 was monitored and controlled by a mass flow controller (MFC), and the equilibration times were at least 20 min for the regular H-type cell and 5 min for the APE electrolyzer before every measurement. On the other hand, the anode gases (O2 and CO2) were quantified using GC, via an extra auxiliary He stream (200 sccm) purging through the water reservoir, which contained 200 mL ultrapure water for circulation to the anode chamber (Fig. S4, ESI†).
Possible gaseous species was calibrated by certified standard gases in advance, thus the faradaic efficiencies (FE) were calculated from the corresponding peak areas from GC:  where φp is the volume fraction of a certain product, derived from GC calibration, Vt represents the applied gas flow rate read from the MFC, and It is the total average current obtained from the potentiostat. R, T, P, n, and F are the ideal gas constant, temperature, pressure, number of electrons transferred, and Faraday constant, respectively.
To analyze the possible liquid product, which could diffuse from the cathode side to the anode side (the water transport rate through the membrane was measured to be ca. 0.4 mL h−1), 100 h electrolysis was carried out, and the water accumulated in the water reservoir (Fig. S4, ESI†), as well as the water vapor condensed at the cathode by a cold trap, was sampled and tested using 1H NMR (WNMR-I, 400 MHz). A standard solution containing all simulated liquid products (including formic acid, acetic acid, methanol and ethanol) was used for comparison. The concentration of the simulated product was 3 mmol L−1 for formic acid and 1.5 mmol L−1 for acetic acid, methanol or ethanol. Before the NMR test, the solution was mixed with an equal volume of D2O, which contained 1 mmol L−1 DMSO to serve as an internal standard.

Broader context
Electrochemical reduction of CO2, to liquid fuels or valuable chemicals, is an energetically reasonable approach, because the electrochemical conversion can make use of solar electricity. However, the practicability of this approach has been questioned; a strong concern is that the solubility of CO2 in electrolytes is too low (ca. 40 mmol L−1) to supply industrial-scale production. The solution is to apply gas-diffusion electrodes (GDEs), in particular making use of polymer electrolytes, analogous to the case of polymer electrolyte fuel cells and polymer electrolyte water electrolysis. The difficulty is that Nafion, the popular acidic polyelectrolyte, cannot be applied in this case, because the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is strongly favored over the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) in acidic media. Alkaline polymer electrolytes (APEs) are thus highly expected to be employed for CO2 electrolysis, but highly conductive and stable APEs have not been available until recently. In this report, we demonstrate the first implementation of CO2 electrolyzers fully based on APEs without adding any alkaline solution. Industrial-scale current densities are hereby achieved, such as 500 mA cm−2@3 V at 60 °C, with a CO faradaic efficiency over 90%. This result manifests that CO2 conversion under mild conditions is now becoming a practically feasible technology.


 	Fig. 1  Basic features of the alkaline polymer electrolyte (APE) CO2 electrolyzer. (a) Structural illustration of the APE CO2 electrolyzer, operated with dry CO2 in the cathode and pure water in the anode. (b) A cross-section SEM image of the core component, the cathode Au/C catalyst layer on the APE membrane (APEM). (c) The OH− percentage in the APEM (OH%) as a function of the CO2 stoichiometry in the cathode, calculated based on the CO2 crossover from the cathode to the anode, measured by GC. Dash lines represent the upper limit of HCO3−/OH− or CO32−/OH−, the realistic OH% is located in the shadow region. The CO2 stoichiometry was changed by varying the current density while keeping the CO2 flow rate at 100 sccm.	 
CO2 + OH− = HCO3−	(R1)
CO2 + 2OH− = CO32− + H2O	(R2)

Cathodic reactions:	CO2 + H2O + 2e− = CO + 2OH− (major)
2H2O + 2e− = H2 + 2OH−
Anodic reactions:a	4OH− = O2 + 2H2O + 4e− (major)
4HCO3− = O2 + 4CO2 + 2H2O + 4e−
2CO32− = O2 + 2CO2 + 4e−
Cell reactions:	2CO2 = 2CO + O2 (major)
2H2O = 2H2 + O2

 	Fig. 2  Cell performance of the APE CO2 electrolyzer. Two kinds of cathode catalyst were applied, i.e., Au (a and b) and CoPc (c and d). I–V curves (a and c) were recorded at 60 °C, and the faradaic efficiencies of CO and H2 production (denoted as COFE and H2FE, respectively) and the energy efficiency (b and d) were calculated based on the GC results, as a function of the applied cell voltage. The Au loading in the cathode was 0.4 mg cm−2, while the CoPc loading was 0.2 mg cm−2. The electrode geometric area was 3.2 cm2, and the CO2 flow rate was fixed at 100 sccm.	 

 	Fig. 3  The APE CO2 electrolyzer working at different temperatures. (a) The temperature dependent cell voltage and CO selectivity under a current density of 0.1 A cm−2. The Au loading in the cathode was 0.4 mg cm−2, and the CO2 flow rate was fixed at 100 sccm. (b) AC impedance spectra recorded at open-circuit voltage, the inset magnifies the high frequency region to show the change of ionic conduction with temperature.	 

 	Fig. 4  Stability test of the APE CO2 electrolyzer. (a) The performance of elongated CO2RR electrolysis at 50 °C under 0.1 A cm−2. The CO2 flow rate was fixed at 100 sccm. The cathode product was sampled intermittently to gain the faradaic efficiency of CO and H2. Before and after this test, (b) the Au catalyst was characterized using XRD and SEM (scale bar = 200 nm), and (c) the APE membrane was analyzed using XPS.
