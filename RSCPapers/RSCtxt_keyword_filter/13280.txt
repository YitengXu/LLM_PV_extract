The champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs with PTB7-Th:PC71BM as the active layer was increased from 6.13% to 7.72% by directly spin-coating PFN methanol solution on the surface of active layers or to 8.50% for the active layer with 4 min PFN methanol solution soaking. The champion PCE of PSCs was further increased to 8.69% for the active layers with a two-step treatment, 4 min methanol soaking and then directly spin-coating PFN methanol solution. A 12.6% PCE improvement was obtained by using the two-step strategy compared with directly spin-coating PFN methanol solution on the active layers. Methanol soaking of the active layers plays the key role in forming the more ideal vertical phase separation for efficient exciton dissociation, charge carrier transport and collection. An ultrathin PFN interfacial dipole layer can be obtained by directly spin-coating PFN methanol solution. The two-step strategy may provide a simple and effective method to finely optimize the phase separation and obtain an ultrathin PFN interfacial dipole layer for the performance improvement of PSCs.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been considered as one of the potential candidates for generating electricity in a clean and renewable way due to their advantages, such as low-cost, light-weight, flexible and solution processing.1 The donor/acceptor (D/A) vertical phase separation in the active layers is critical for obtaining the optimized performance of PSCs.2,3 An ideal D/A vertical phase separation in the active layers for obtaining highly efficient PSCs has three features: (i) multiple D/A interfaces for efficient charge carrier generation; (ii) a bicontinuous interpenetrated network for efficient charge carrier transfer; (iii) gradual distribution in the vertical direction with the acceptor enriched near the cathode for better charge carrier collection by individual electrodes.4,5 Several efficient strategies have been employed to modify and control the phase separation of the active layer, such as thermal annealing, hot solution, solvent vapor annealing, mixing solvent, and solvent additives.6–10 Interfacial engineering also plays a critical role in improving the performance of PSCs by incorporating an interfacial layer between the active layers and electrodes. The conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) are considered as promising candidates for cathode interfacial materials to form an interfacial dipole for obtaining highly efficient PSCs.11–13 In general, CPEs possess both the conjugated backbone which ensure their semiconductor properties and highly polar side chains (such as ionization group) which endow their good water/alcohol solubility, their water/alcohol solution-processed properties provide a simple fabrication method to effectively protect the active layers.14 The main functions of CPEs as cathode interfacial layers are attributed to the formation of strong interfacial dipoles and ion migration due to their highly polar ionic pendant groups.15,16 The interfacial dipole can increase the surface potential of the active layer, which results in the increase of the internal built-in potential across the active layer for efficient charge carrier transport and collection.17,18 Alcohols are considered as potential solvents to prepare solution processed CPE interfacial layers, especially with methanol as the commonly used solvent. The methanol solution processed poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) was successfully applied as the interfacial layer to improve the performance of PSCs.19–22 In previous studies, the solution processed PFN interfacial layer with methanol as the solvent has been considered as mature technology applied for the fabrication of PSCs.23,24 However, the working mechanism of the solution processed PFN interfacial layer is not very clear due to the neglected effect of methanol solvent.
The methanol treatment has been demonstrated as an efficient method to improve the performance of PSCs by directly spin-coating methanol onto the surface of the active layer. The improved performance of PSCs by methanol treatment is attributed to the optimized D/A phase separation and the removal of the residual solvent or solvent additive in the active layers.25,26 Cao et al. reported that electron injection can be improved by methanol treatment in organic light emitting diodes, which was attributed to the strong interfacial dipole layer between the active layer and cathode.27 As we know, the high boiling point solvent 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was commonly used as the solvent additive to optimize D/A phase separation due to its feature of selective dissolution fullerene-derivatives.28 However, the solvent additive DIO may be residual in the active layers due to its high boiling point. It is known that DIO molecules are highly sensitive to light, or directly saturate the polymer conjugated backbone or be trapped by the fullerene moieties, which results in the instability of PSCs with DIO residual in the active layers.29 For the active layer with DIO as the solvent additive followed by spin-coating methanol, fullerene-derivatives can be elevated towards the top surface of the active layer during the volatilization of methanol because methanol does not dissolve fullerene-derivatives or polymers but mixes very well with the DIO additive.30 The synergetic function of methanol and DIO additive can further adjust the vertical phase separation to improve the performance of PSCs. Although vertical phase separation can be realized by directly spin-coating methanol onto the surface of the active layer, the more ideal vertical phase separation is expected by precise control. The solvent vapor treatment method was carried out by placing the sample in a vessel full of solvent vapor to optimize phase separation by adjusting the treatment time.31 However, it is difficult to adjust the phase separation by solvent vapor treatment due to the inadequate contact between methanol and the active layers. This method may also be a great challenge for preparing PSCs on a large scale. Methanol soaking of the active layer can provide adequate contact between methanol and the active layers, resulting in the redistribution of electron acceptors during the volatilization of methanol and the solvent additive.32–34
The main function of a methanol solution processed PFN interfacial layer may be attributed to the optimized vertical phase separation by methanol and the formed strong interfacial dipole by the ultrathin PFN interfacial layer. To confirm our speculation on the working mechanism of the solution processed PFN interfacial layer, a two-step strategy was proposed by methanol soaking the active layers and then spin-coating the PFN interfacial layer. The different methanol soaking time provides more opportunities to adjust the vertical phase separation. In this work, the effects of solution processed PFN interfacial layer on the performance of PSCs were investigated based on the cells with poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dit-hiophene-co-3-fluor-othieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate] (PTB7-Th) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as active layers. The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs exhibit a strong dependence on methanol or the PFN methanol solution soaking time. A champion PCE of 8.50% is obtained for the active layers with 4 min PFN methanol solution soaking, which is higher than that of 7.74% for the active layers with 4 min methanol soaking. A champion PCE of 8.69% is obtained for the active layers by using the two-step strategy of methanol soaking and spin-coating the PFN interfacial layer. The synergistic functions of methanol soaking and PFN interfacial layer were successfully applied to further improve the performance of PSCs, which means that the two-step strategy should be a simple and effective method to further improve the performance of PSCs.
2. Experimental section
The polymers PTB7-Th (purchased from Organtec Material Inc.) and PC71BM (purchased from Luminescence Technology Corp.) with a weight ratio of 1:1.5 were dissolved in a mixed solvent (o-dichlorobenzene/chlorobenzene at volume ratio of 1:1) with a total concentration of 25 mg ml−1. The mixed solution was stirred with a magnetic stirrer at 70 °C for 12 hours, and then 3 vol% 1,8-diiodooctane additive was added to form the final PTB7-Th:PC71BM solution. The conjugated polyelectrolyte PFN was dissolved in methanol with addition of 0.25 vol% acetic acid with a concentration of 0.2 mg ml−1 solution. The indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates with a sheet resistance of 15 Ω per square were cleaned consecutively in ultrasonic baths containing detergent, deionized water and ethanol. Then the cleaned ITO substrates were dried with nitrogen-gas and treated with UV-ozone for 10 min to further clean the substrates and increase the work function of ITO. The solution of poly-(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly-(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (purchased from H. C. Starck Co. Ltd) was spin-coated onto the ITO substrates at 5000 round per min (rpm) for 40 s. Then PEDOT:PSS coated ITO substrates were dried in air at 120 °C for 10 min. The blend PTB7-Th:PC71BM solution was spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layers for preparing the active layers at 1500 rpm for 40 s in a high purity nitrogen filled glove box. After being dried for 30 min, different treatment conditions on the surface of the active layer were carried out using methanol or PFN methanol solution. A cathode of 100 nm thickness aluminum (Al) was deposited by thermal evaporation under 10−4 Pa and the thickness was monitored by using a quartz crystal microbalance. The active area of each device is about 3.8 mm2, which is defined by the overlap of the ITO anode and the Al cathode. To clarify the positive effect of the solution processed PFN interfacial layer on the performance of PSCs, the active layers were treated with methanol or PFN methanol solution or a two-step strategy, respectively. The schematic diagram of the active layers treated with methanol or PFN methanol solution is shown in Scheme 1. The two-step strategy was carried out by methanol soaking the active layers and then spin-coating the PFN interfacial layer on the active layers. The device structure of PSCs is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layers/(with or without) PFN interfacial layer/Al.
 Scheme 1  The schematic diagram of the active layers treated with methanol or PFN methanol solution: (i) 100 μl of solution (methanol or PFN methanol solution) was dropped onto the surface of the active layer; (ii) the dropped solution was kept on the surface of the active layer for different times; (iii) the residual solution was removed from the surface of the active layer by rotating the sample at 3000 rpm for 40 s. 
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured by using a Keithley 4200 semiconductor characterization system at room temperature under atmospheric conditions. AM1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 was provided by using an ABET Sun 2000 solar simulator. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured by using a Zolix Solar Cell Scan 100. Absorption spectra of films were measured with a Shimadzu UV-3101 PC spectrophotometer. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained by using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM, JEM-2100) operating at 200 kV. Prior to the TEM characterization, the films were stripped from the PEDOT:PSS substrate by soaking the samples into deionized water and then transfer onto a holey carbon-coated copper grid. The surface morphologies of the films were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) using a multimode Nanoscope IIIa operating in tapping mode. The water contact angle images of films were recorded by using a KRÜSS DSA 100 instrument under atmospheric conditions. The work functions of the active layers were evaluated by using a KP-020 ambient kelvin probe system.
3. Results and discussion
To clarify the positive effect of the solution processed PFN interfacial layer on the performance of PSCs, a two-step strategy was carried out by methanol soaking the active layers and then spin-coating the PFN methanol solution on the active layers. The effect of methanol soaking the active layers on the performance of PSCs was investigated by adjusting the methanol soaking time. The methanol soaking time is defined as the time interval from the solution doped onto the surface of the active layers to the beginning of spin-coating; the soaking times were adjusted from 0 min to 6 min with 1 min increment. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of PSCs with different methanol soaking times were measured under AM1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 and are shown in Fig. S1.† The typical J–V curves of PSCs without or with 0, 2, 4, and 6 min soaking time are shown in Fig. 1a. It is apparent that the performances of PSCs are markedly increased by an appropriate methanol soaking time compared with the PSCs without methanol treatment. The positive effect of methanol treatment on the performance of PSCs can be further confirmed from the corresponding EQE spectra, as shown in Fig. 1b. The EQE spectra also exhibit an apparent increase and then slight decrease in the whole spectral range along with the increase of the methanol soaking time. A champion PCE of 7.74% is obtained from the PSCs with 4 min methanol soaking the active layers, along with an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.78 V, a short circuit current (JSC) of 16.66 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 59.6%. According to the J–V curves, the key photovoltaic parameters of PSCs are summarized in Table 1. For more intuitive description of the variation trend, the dependence of the key parameters of PSCs on the methanol soaking time is shown in Fig. S2.†

It is apparent that the VOC of PSCs is increased from 0.73 V to 0.78 V by directly spin-coating methanol on the active layer or with methanol soaking the active layers. To provide more solid experimental results of PSCs without spin-coating methanol on the active layers, the detailed J–V curves of the PSCs prepared from different batches are shown in Fig. S3.† The VOC values of PSCs without spin-coating methanol on the active layers are maintained at 0.73 V with a 0.01 V uncertainty degree. For the PSCs with methanol soaking the active layers, the enhanced VOC should be attributed to the interfacial dipole between the active layers and the metal cathode induced by methanol treatment, a similar phenomenon has been reported by other groups.35,36 For the active layers with different methanol soaking times, the VOC of PSCs is almost maintained constant at about 0.78 V with a 0.01 V uncertainty degree. The interfacial dipole may induce an increased built-in potential across the active layer, which is beneficial to charge carrier transport and collection with a decreased charge carrier recombination loss.22 The enhanced charge carrier transport and collection can be further confirmed from the increased FF from 56.9% to 60.7% and the increased JSC from 14.75 mA cm−2 to 16.66 mA cm−2, respectively. The FF of PSCs is maintained at about 60% for the active layers with less than 4 min methanol soaking and is decreased to 55.6% for the active layer with 6 min methanol soaking. The effect of methanol soaking the active layers on FF and JSC of PSCs should be analyzed from the variation of vertical phase separation induced by the volatilization of the DIO additive and methanol from the active layers. It can be envisaged that methanol soaking the active layers can provide a driving force for DIO volatilizing from the wet active layers, the more PC71BM can be elevated near the top surface of active layers during the volatilization process of DIO additive in the active layers. The longer methanol soaking time may result in excessive PC71BM aggregation near the top surface of active layers. The speculation on the PC71BM redistribution in the active layer can be confirmed from the decrease of FF and JSC induced by the longer methanol soaking time on the active layers.
To further clarify the effect of methanol soaking time on the redistribution of PC71BM in the active layers, the absorption spectra of the active layer without or with different methanol soaking times were measured and are shown in Fig. 2a. It is apparent that the absorption intensity of the active layers is enhanced by methanol soaking, especially in the short wavelength range corresponding to the absorption range of PC71BM. The absorption intensity of active layers around 710 nm is slightly increased by methanol soaking, which corresponds to the absorption peak of PTB7-Th. The variation of absorption intensity can be directly reflected from the photo image of the active layer on the ITO substrate, part of the active layer was soaked by methanol with 4 min, as shown in Fig. 2b. The increased absorption intensity of the active layers should be attributed to the appropriate aggregation of PC71BM in the active layers, resulting in better phase separation for efficient exciton dissociation, charge carrier transport and collection.31,37 The absorption intensity of the active layers is continuously increased along with methanol soaking time up to 6 min, which means that the loss of PC71BM in the active layers is negligible during methanol soaking and then the spin-coating process. Therefore, the decreased JSC of PSCs with more than 4 min methanol soaking may be mainly attributed to the lesser PC71BM dispersion in the interior of the active layers, resulting in the limited exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport in the active layers.
 Fig. 2  (a) Absorption spectra of active layers with different methanol soaking times (the thickness of all films is about 100 (±6) nm); (b) the photo image of the active layer without and with 4 min methanol soaking. 
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a powerful method to identify the presence of distinct polymer-rich or PC71BM-rich phases in bulk morphology of the active layers. In order to confirm the effect of DIO additive and methanol soaking on the redistribution of PC71BM in the active layers, the bulk morphology of blend films was measured by TEM and is shown in Fig. 3. The black domain is assigned as the PC71BM aggregation because its ordered aggregation shows relatively higher electron scattering density compared to the amorphous polymer aggregation.38 The blend film without the DIO additive exhibits rather featureless bulk morphology due to the PC71BM homogeneous dispersion throughout the film (Fig. 3a).39 A fine network of bright and dark regions can be obviously observed in Fig. 3b for the blend films with DIO additive due to the slight aggregation of PC71BM in the blend films. The size of bright or dark regions of blend films with 4 min methanol soaking time is markedly increased, as shown in Fig. 3c, indicating that more PC71BM molecules prefer to aggregate in the active layers during the volatilization of the DIO additive and methanol. The aggregation or diffusion of PC71BM in the active layers should result in the corresponding change of surface morphological features.
 Fig. 3  TEM images of PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend films: (a) without DIO additive; (b) with DIO additive and without methanol soaking; (c) with DIO additive and with 4 min methanol soaking. 
To further verify the effect of DIO additive and methanol on the morphology of the active layers, the surface morphology of active layers with different treatments was measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM), as shown in Fig. 4. According to the phase images of active layers, no obvious phase separation can be observed for the active layers without DIO additives due to the better miscibility of PTB7-Th and PC71BM. An apparent phase separation can be more clearly observed for the active layers with DIO additive, especially for the active layers with DIO additive and methanol treatment. From the surface morphology image of the active layers, the root mean square (RMS) surface roughness of active layers is increased from 0.97 nm to 1.54 nm to 1.73 nm by adding the DIO additive or further methanol treatment, respectively. The increased roughness of the active layers should be attributed to PC71BM aggregation near the top surface of the active layer during the volatilization of DIO additive and methanol. The synergistic effect of DIO additive and methanol volatilization on the aggregation of PC71BM in the active layers can be adequately confirmed from AFM and TEM images.

Water contact angle (WCA) characterization is an effective tool to provide more intuitive information on the wettability evolution of the surface components and of the blend films.40 The WCA characterizations of neat PTB7-Th, PC71BM films and the blend films with different methanol soaking time were measured to give more solid evidence on the vertical phase separation of active layers that were induced by methanol soaking time. The WCA images of all the films without or with different methanol soaking time are shown in Fig. 5. The WCAs of neat PTB7-Th and PC71BM films are about 99.7° and 80.2°, indicating that PC71BM has relatively strong hydrophilic properties. The WCA of blend films without methanol treatment is 98.1° and is slightly less than that of neat PTB7-Th films due to the appearance of PC71BM on the top surface of blend films. The WCAs of blend films are monotonously decreased from 98.1° to 92.0° along with the increase of methanol soaking time. The gradually decreased WCAs indicate that more PC71BM molecules can be elevated onto the top surface of blend films along with the increase of methanol soaking time. To semi-quantify the content of PC71BM at the top surface, the fractions (f) of the active layer surface covered by PC71BM are calculated by using the Cassie–Baxter equation,41 cosθ = fcosθPC71BM + (1 − f)cosθPTB7-Th(1)where θPTB7-Th, θPC71BM and θ are the measured WCAs of neat PTB7-Th film, neat PC71BM film and the blend films, respectively. The calculated PC71BM surface coverage fraction is about 8% for the active layers without methanol treatment, and then increased to 13% by methanol soaking, even up to 39% along with the increase of methanol soaking time. The dependence of water contact angle (θ), cosθ, and PC71BM surface coverage fraction on the methanol soaking time is shown in Fig. S4† and Table 2. The markedly increased PC71BM surface coverage fraction indicates that more PC71BM molecules have been elevated up toward the top surface of blend films during the volatilization of DIO additive and methanol. A graded BHJ structure with an increasing fullerene-derivative percentage from bottom to top surface has been formed, which is beneficial to improve the PSC performance. The experimental results of WCAs are in well accordance with the observed from AFM and TEM images, more PCBM molecules should be aggregated near the top surface of active layers along with the increase of methanol soaking time.

The performance improvement of PSC dependence on methanol soaking time should be attributed to the appropriate vertical phase separation with more PC71BM near the top surface of active layers induced by the volatilization of the DIO additive and methanol. It can be inferred that PFN methanol solution soaking the active layers should take a similar effect on the vertical phase separation, resulting in a similar performance variation of PSCs. To further confirm the positive effect of PFN methanol solution soaking on the performance of PSCs, a series of PSCs were fabricated with different PFN methanol solution soaking times from 0 min to 6 min with 1 min increment. The J–V curves of PSCs with different PNF solution soaking times were measured under AM1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 and are shown in Fig. S5.† The typical J–V curves and EQE spectra of PSCs with different PNF solution soaking times are shown in Fig. 6. The key parameters of PSCs with different PNF solution soaking times are listed in Table 3. It is apparent that solution processed PFN interfacial layer plays an important role in improving the performance of PSCs. The VOC of PSCs is markedly increased to about 0.80 V by spin-coating the PFN interfacial layer compared with that of 0.73 V for the PSCs with as-cast films as the active layers. The VOC of 0.80 V is also slightly larger than that of PSCs with methanol treatment, which can be attributed to the stronger interfacial dipole formed by the PFN interfacial layer.19–22 To probe the origin of VOC improvement, the work functions of active layers with (without) methanol or PFN methanol solution treatment were investigated by kelvin probe technology, as shown in Fig. S6.† This technique has also been applied for the study of organic semiconductors.42,43 At this reference value the active layer without any treatment possesses a work function of 4.78 eV according to the average values of 100 points. The work functions of the active layers with methanol or PFN methanol solution treatment are reduced by 0.05 eV and 0.08 eV due to the interfacial dipole layer at the organic/metal interface, which is very similar to the literature reports.27,44,45 The interfacial dipole layer is beneficial to increase the built-in field, resulting in the increased VOC of PSCs. The dependence of key photovoltaic parameters of PSCs with PFN methanol solution soaking on soaking time exhibits a similar variation trend compared with the observed from the PSCs with methanol soaking, as shown in Fig. S7.† The champion PCE of PSCs is increased to 8.50% along with a JSC of 17.06 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.80 V and a FF of 62.3% for the active layers with 4 min PFN methanol solution soaking. When the active layers are soaked with PFN methanol solution with a soaking time of more than 4 min, the JSC and FF exhibit an apparent decrease trend compared with the active layers soaked with methanol. This phenomenon may be attributed to the increased thickness of the PFN interfacial layer during the long PFN methanol solution soaking, resulting in the limited charge carrier collection.

The schematic diagrams of PTB7-Th:PC71BM phase separation without and with PFN methanol solution soaking are shown in Fig. 7. The evolution process of D/A phase separation in the active layers can be analyzed from the volatilization of working solvents, solvent additive DIO and methanol effect on the aggregation of PC71BM in the active layers. The mixed solvents with DCB:CB (1:1, v/v) as the working solvent, the boiling points of DCB and CB are about 180 °C and 132 °C, respectively.46 The DIO additive with a high boiling point of 333 °C was doped into mixed solvents with 3 vol% to form better vertical phase separation.47–49 Therefore, the working solvents have a relatively fast volatilization process compared with the DIO additive from the active layers. It means that the polymer network of PTB7-Th is rapidly fixed during the rapid volatilization of working solvents due to their low boiling points. The PC71BM can be grasped into nanodroplets among the polymer network due to the better solubility of PC71BM in the DIO additive compared with the working solvents.30,50 The residual DIO additive in the active layers may decrease the performance and stability of PSCs, because DIO molecules are highly sensitive to light and can directly saturate the polymer conjugated backbone or be trapped by the fullerene moieties.29 In fact, the residual DIO additive can be slowly removed from the active layer under vacuum conditions. The slow removal process of the residual DIO additive in the active layers under vacuum conditions may result in slight PC71BM aggregation in the active layer due to the small driving force, which is not beneficial to form better vertical phase separation. Methanol has a low boiling point of 65 °C and rather low dissolubility (<0.01 mg ml−1) of the active layer materials but good dissolubility of DIO.44 Therefore, methanol soaking the active layers provides a relatively rapid removal process of the residual DIO additive to form better vertical phase separation. Meanwhile, methanol treatment on the active layers can form interfacial dipoles for efficient charge carrier collection, resulting in the enhanced built-in field in the PSCs. A similar effect of PFN methanol solution on the phase separation should be obtained due to the same methanol effect. However, the thickness of the PFN interfacial layer should be increased along with the increase of PFN methanol solution soaking time. The charge carrier collection may be limited due to the excessive thickness of PFN interfacial layers. To achieve better vertical phase separation with the maintenance of an ultrathin PFN interfacial layer, a two-step strategy was proposed with different methanol soaking times and then directly spin-coating PFN methanol solution on the active layers.

The J–V curves of PSCs with the two-step strategy or only spin-coating PFN methanol solution were measured under AM1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2, as shown in Fig. S8.† The typical J–V curves and EQE spectra of PSCs are shown in Fig. 8. The key parameters of PSCs are summarized in Table 4. It is apparent that the JSC values of PSCs with the two-step treatment are larger than those of PSCs with only spin-coating PFN methanol solution. The VOC of all PSCs is maintained at about 0.80 V with a 0.01 V uncertainty degree. The variation trend of FF is very similar to that of PSCs with different methanol soaking times, as shown in Fig. S9.† A champion PCE of 8.69% is obtained based on the active layers with 4 min methanol soaking and then spin-coating PFN methanol solution, with a JSC of 17.66 mA cm−2, and a FF of 61.5%. It should be highlighted that the FFs of all PSCs with the two-step treatment are maintained at more than 60%, which should be attributed to better vertical phase separation for efficient exciton dissociation and the ultrathin interfacial dipole layer for better charge carrier collection.

To more intuitively exhibit the advantage of the two-step strategy on the performance improvement of PSCs, the J–V curves of optimized PSCs with different treatment methods are summarized in Fig. 9a. The JSC of PSCs is markedly increased from 14.75 mA cm−2 to 16.66 mA cm−2, 17.06 mA cm−2 and 17.66 mA cm−2 for the active layers with the optimized methanol soaking time, the optimized PFN methanol solution soaking time and the optimized two-step strategy. The corresponding VOC of PSCs is also increased from 0.73 V to 0.78 V or 0.80 V by spin-coating methanol or PFN methanol solution on the active layers, respectively. The champion FF is obtained based on the active layers by directly spin-coating methanol or PFN methanol solution. The champion FF is simultaneously increased from 56.9% to 60.6%, 64.9% and 66.6% along with the increase of VOC and JSC by using the optimized treatment strategies, respectively. It is known that the PCE of PSCs strongly depends on the production of VOC, JSC and FF. The champion PCE values are increased from 6.13% to 7.74%, 8.50% and 8.69%, respectively. The PCE dependence on methanol or PFN methanol solution soaking time is described in Fig. 9b. The optimized methanol or PFN methanol solution soaking time is about 4 minutes, which can be well understood from the methanol working mechanism on the vertical phase separation. The long soaking time may result in the excessive PC71BM aggregation in the active layers, which will limit the exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport.

4. Conclusions
A two-step strategy with methanol soaking and then directly spin-coating PFN methanol solution was proposed to simultaneously adjust D/A vertical phase separation and obtain an ultrathin PFN interfacial dipole layer. All the key parameters of PSCs are simultaneously improved by using the two-step strategy. The champion PCE of PSCs reaches 8.69% for the active layer with 4 min methanol soaking and then directly spin-coating PFN methanol solution, which exhibits a 12.6% improvement compared to that of 7.72% for the PSCs with only spin-coating PFN methanol solution on the active layers, a 24.1% improvement compared to that of 7.00% for the PSCs with only spin-coating methanol, a 41.8% improvement compared to that of 6.13% for the PSCs without methanol or PFN methanol solution treatment. An appropriate methanol or PFN methanol solution soaking time plays a key role in improving the performance of PSCs. The more ideal vertical phase separation with enriched PC71BM near the top surface of the active layer can be formed during the volatilization of DIO additive and methanol. The underlying reason of the solution processed PFN interfacial layer on the performance improvement of PSCs should be attributed to two factors: (i) methanol soaking the active layers can form the more ideal vertical phase separation; (ii) the strong interfacial dipole of the ultrathin PFN layer can improve the built-in potential across the active layer for the efficient charge carrier transport and collection. The two-step strategy may provide a simple and effective method to finely optimize the phase separation and obtain an ultrathin PFN interfacial dipole layer for the performance improvement of PSCs.
