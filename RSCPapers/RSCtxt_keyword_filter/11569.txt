    , Accepted 14th May 2023First published on 15th May 2023AbstractThe formation of a two-dimensional (2D) perovskite layer on the top of three-dimensional (3D) perovskite has been demonstrated to be effective in reducing interfacial charge recombination and improving the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, it is difficult to fabricate a 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction with accurate composition and structure through a solution-only process, and the location of the 2D perovskite is also difficult to regulate owing to the uncontrolled cation exchange between organic constituents, which results in mismatched energy level arrangements. Herein, a 2D perovskite with a spacer cation of 1,4-dimethylphenylene ammonium is grown on 3D perovskite film by the solid-state heat-pressure method. The relevant growth process, light absorption ability, energy level regulation, and stability of the samples are systematically investigated. A broad range of experimental characterizations show that the introduction of 2D perovskite improves the energy level alignment with the adjacent carbon electrode and enhances the hydrophobic property of the perovskite sample. As a result, a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.63% is achieved for the carbon-based hole-transport-layer-free PSCs based on 2D/3D heterojunction, which is higher than that of the control 3D device (11.88%). Simultaneously, the improved device retains 90% of its initial performance after aging for 1000 h in ambient conditions. The present work opens a new avenue for designing 2D/3D perovskite heterojunctions and improving the performance and stability of PSCs.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskites have attracted considerable attention as photovoltaic materials thanks to their outstanding photophysical properties, such as high absorption coefficient, low exciton binding energy, long carrier diffusion length, high carrier mobility, and high defect tolerance.1–5 Their solution-processable fabrication, high efficiency and cost-effective materials enable a low, stable cost of electricity.6–9 In the past few years, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cell (PSCs) has increased rapidly from 3.8% to 25.7%, close to the record PCE of traditional crystal silicon solar cells.10–12 Although a high-level PCE has been achieved, long-term stability still needs to be enhanced to meet the outdoor operation requirements.13–16 Hole transport layers (HTLs) are commonly necessary in the device structure; they routinely undertake the job of transporting holes and blocking electrons.17,18 However, the widely used organic hole transport materials, such as Spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA, require doping to improve their electrical conductivity. The additional dopants, such as Li salts (Li-TFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), are hygroscopic and usually induce ionic migration issues, which accelerate degradation of the devices and complicate the fabrication process.19 Encouragingly, perovskite materials possess ambipolar carrier transport property, which enables the fabrication of hole-transport-layer-free devices.20,21 On the other hand, noble metals such as Au and Ag are commonly used in high-efficiency PSCs.22,23 Nevertheless, the employment of metal contact electrodes is also one of the dominant factors leading to the deterioration of PSC performance due to the diffusion of metal ions and subsequent reaction with the halogen ions from the perovskite layer.24 Moreover, the deposition of metal counter electrodes requires high-vacuum and high-temperature equipment, which undoubtedly increases the energy consumption and manufacturing cost. Compared with noble metal electrodes, carbon materials have been demonstrated to be cost-effective and simple processable electrode candidates, and their hydrophobic nature and covalent bond structure endow exceptional moisture resistance and chemical inertness, which avoids the electrode corrosion mentioned above.25–32 Therefore, it is worthwhile to develop carbon-based hole-transport-layer-free (HTL-free) PSCs to enhance the device stability and reduce the fabrication cost.
In 2013, Han and coworkers first reported carbon-based HTL-free PSCs and achieved an efficiency of 6.6%.33 Since then, the employment of carbon materials to replace the hole transport layer and metal electrodes has attracted widespread attention. A number of regulation strategies were proposed to improve the performance of carbon-based HTL-free PSCs, including device structure optimization,34,35 organic molecule post-treatments,15,36,37 and low-dimensional perovskite engineering.38–40 However, the efficiency of this type of PSC is still far lower than that of conventional PSC devices, which results from the severe charge recombination at the perovskite/carbon interface, originating from mismatched energy levels, weak hole extraction and poor contact.41,42 Therefore, the optimization of interface structure is a primary prerequisite for obtaining highly efficient and stable carbon-based HTL-free PSCs.43 The formation of a two-dimensional (2D) perovskite layer on the top of 3D counterpart is demonstrated as an effective approach to address these issues, providing a chance to simultaneously passivate surface defects, optimize energy band arrangement, and improve the interface contact and stability of the device.44–49 Recently, Han et al. post-treated the perovskite/carbon interface with pentafluorophenylethylammonium iodide (F5PEAI), and reduced-dimensional perovskites (F5PEA2MAn−1PbnI3n+1) were formed, which improve the band alignment and charge transportation performance; an overall efficiency of 16.24% was realized.38 Kim et al. introduced 2D perovskite as an electron-blocking layer by the deposition of octylammonium iodide (OAI) on top of 3D FAPbI3 perovskite, and an efficiency of 18.5% was achieved, which is one of the highest efficiencies for carbon-based HTL-free PSCs at present.50 However, the formation of 2D perovskite based on organic amine salt treatment has limitations in the precise control of the n value, the composition and structure, and the integrity and uniformity of the 2D perovskite layer, which induces severe ion diffusion, recombination loss, and structural instability, thus negatively impacting the device performance.
In this work, a Dion–Jacobson (DJ)-type 2D perovskite layer ((PhDMA)MA3Pb4I13) was introduced by solid-state heat-pressure method to reduce the interfacial charge recombination loss at the perovskite/carbon interface. It was found that the fabricated 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction possesses a well intact interface structure and desirable energy level. A wide range of experimental characterizations show that a type II band alignment structure was formed after the introduction of the 2D perovskite modified layer, which promotes the extraction of holes and prevents the transfer of electrons to the carbon electrode, thus reducing carrier recombination losses at the interface. As a result, an extraordinary efficiency of 15.63% was realized by the carbon-based HTL-free PSCs, and long-term stability was significantly enhanced, which resulted from the improved hydrophobic property of the 2D perovskite materials.
Results and discussion
A schematic diagram of the detailed fabrication process of the carbon-based HTL-free PSCs based on 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction is shown in Fig. 1. The 2D perovskite films and 3D perovskite films were deposited on FTO and TiO2/FTO substrates, respectively. The 2D perovskite films are stacked on the top of 3D perovskite films, putting their surfaces in contact. Subsequently, certain heat and perpendicular pressure were applied to the substrate surface to fabricate the 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction. Then, carbon electrodes were printed onto the samples by screen-printing method. The detailed experimental processes are provided in the experimental section. Compared with the commonly used solution process, the random distribution of the 2D perovskite phases, which can lead to mismatched band alignments, are avoided by this solid-state heat-pressure method.

The device configuration of the carbon-based HTL-free PSCs is illustrated in Fig. 2a. To clarify the function of the 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction, devices based on only 3D perovskite films were also fabricated as control samples for comparison. The schematic illustration of the 2D/3D perovskite crystal interface is exhibited in Fig. 2b. The DJ-type 2D perovskite was adopted as the interface modification material, and the molecular structure of the spacer cation is presented in the upper area of Fig. 2b. Compared with the traditional 2D Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) structures, the DJ-type perovskite exhibits improved charge transport performance across the inorganic layer due to the absence of a van der Waals gap.51,52 The cross-sectional SEM image of a full carbon-based HTL-free PSC device based on 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction is shown in Fig. 2c, where we can observe that a well-defined multilayer structure is formed in this device, and a continuous 2D overlayer is coated on the 3D perovskite layer.

The influence of heat-pressure temperature on the photovoltaic output was first evaluated. Fig. 2d shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves, measured in reverse scan direction, of the perovskite devices based on different heat-pressure temperatures; the relevant photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. As displayed in Table 1, all the devices based on 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction show higher efficiency than the control 3D sample. The control 3D device shows a PCE of 11.88%, with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 20.73 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.94 V, and fill factor (FF) of 60.57%, and when the heat-pressure temperature is 40 °C, the device shows a PCE of 13.55%. When the heat-pressure temperature is further increased to 60 °C, the device shows a peak PCE of 15.63%, with a Jsc of 21.81 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.01 V, and FF of 70.62%. The improved Voc and FF are mainly ascribed to the inhibited interfacial carrier nonradiative recombination resulting from the improved energy level alignment, which will be demonstrated in the following discussion. The improved PCE with increased heat-pressure temperature is attributed to the improved integrity and uniformity of the 2D perovskite modification layer, as discussed in SEM results. However, with the further increase of heat-pressure temperature to 80 °C, the device shows a decreased photovoltaic performance. The phenomenon is attributed to the amount of 2D perovskite further increasing at 80 °C, and the excessive deposition of 2D perovskite material has a negative effect on the charge carrier transport. As exhibited in Fig. 2e, f and Table 2, the notorious J–V hysteresis phenomena are remarkably suppressed after the introduction of the 2D perovskite modification layer, which results from the alleviated ion migration and inner capacitive effects. As exhibited in Fig. 2g, the best-performing device based on the 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction shows a steady-state output power of 15.29% over 400 s at a maximum power point voltage of 0.78 V under continuous AM 1.5G illumination, which matches well with the J–V results. To prove the reliability of the photovoltaic measurements, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra and the corresponding integrated Jsc curves are given in Fig. 2h. The calculated integrated Jsc of the control 3D sample and 2D/3D sample are 19.88 and 20.95 mA cm−2, respectively, which match well with the J–V results, proving the reliability of the photovoltaic measurements. Fig. 2i presents the statistical distribution of the PCE of 20 independent devices along with Gaussian fitting; the modified device shows a higher average efficiency, which confirms the outstanding reproducibility.

The surface morphology evolution of the perovskite samples was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Fig. 3a, the control 3D sample possesses full surface coverage and is composed of polygonal perovskite grains. After the introduction of the 2D perovskite-modified layer, a covering layer appeared on the surface of the 2D perovskite samples, as exhibited in Fig. 3b–d; all the modified samples were retained for 20 min under 60 MPa. When the heat-pressure temperature was 40 °C, an island-like product appeared on the 3D perovskite surface. The products became enlarged, with continuous state, and filled fully on the 3D perovskite surface when the heat-pressure temperature reached 60 °C and 80 °C. The crystal structures of the perovskite samples were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. As shown in Fig. 3e, the pure 2D perovskite shows a characteristic peak at 9.23°, and both the control and 2D/3D samples exhibit the characteristic diffraction peak of MAPbI3 perovskite films with the dominant peak at 14.23° corresponding to the (100) lattice plane.53 Compared to the control 3D sample, a new diffraction peak at 9.23° is produced, which suggests the formation of 2D perovskite. Subsequently, the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra were further measured to investigate the optical property of the perovskite layer. As shown in Fig. 3f, the absorption edges of the control 3D sample and 2D/3D sample are almost identical, which is attributed the similar band gaps of 3D perovskite (MAPbI3) and 2D perovskite ((PhDMA)MA3Pb4I13), as previously reported.54

(e) XRD patterns of 2D, control 3D and 2D/3D perovskite samples. (f) UV-vis absorption spectra of control 3D perovskite and the best-performing 2D/3D samples. 
To further evaluate the effects of the 2D perovskite-modified layer on the arrangement of energy levels, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurement was employed. Fig. 4a and b shows the Tauc plots of control 3D and 2D/3D perovskite samples, which were derived from the UV-vis absorption spectra, and both the samples show a band gap (Eg) of 1.60 eV. The secondary electron cutoff edges (Ecutoff) and valence band regions of the control 3D and 2D/3D perovskite samples are presented in Fig. 4c. Based on the formula EF = 21.22 eV − Ecutoff, the Fermi level (EF) values of the control perovskite and 2D/3D perovskite were determined to be −4.28 eV and −4.10 eV, respectively. The values of EF − EVBM (maximum of valence band) were calculated to be 1.34 eV and 1.16 eV, respectively, and thus, the EVBM values of control perovskite and 2D/3D perovskite were determined to be −5.62 eV and −5.26 eV, respectively.8,55 Combined with the Tauc results, the conduction band minimum (ECB) of the control and 2D/3D perovskite were determined to be −4.02 eV and −3.66 eV, respectively. The corresponding energy band diagram of the 2D/3D perovskite is presented in Fig. 4d, where a type II band alignment structure is formed. As seen, the energy offset between the EVBM of control 3D perovskite and work function of the carbon electrode (−5.0 eV) decreased from 0.62 eV to 0.36 eV after the introduction of 2D perovskite, which can promote hole extraction and block electron transfer to the carbon electrode, leading to a reduced non-radiative recombination energy loss at the perovskite/carbon interface.

(d) Energy level diagram of the 2D/3D perovskite sample and carbon electrode. 
To clarify the effects of the 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction on the interfacial charge carrier separation and dynamic recombination, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were conducted, where the perovskite films were deposited on FTO/TiO2 substrates. As shown in Fig. 5a, both the control 3D and 2D/3D perovskite films exhibit PL emission peaks at 770 nm, which corresponds to band-to-band radiative recombination.
 Fig. 5  (a) Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra and (b) time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of control 3D and 2D/3D samples on FTO/TiO2 substrate. 
We also observe that the PL emission peak is significantly quenched after the introduction of the 2D perovskite modified layer, which proves the improved charge carrier separation and transfer. In TRPL measurements (Fig. 5b), the curves were fitted by the biexponential function, and the average decay times (τave) were calculated by the following equations: y = A1e(−t/τ1) + A2e(−t/τ2)(1) τave = (A1τ12 + A2τ22)/(A1τ1 + A2τ2),(2)where A1 and A2 are decay amplitudes; τ1 and τ2 are fast decay lifetimes and slow decay lifetimes, respectively. As a result, the 2D/3D perovskite sample shows a shorter carrier lifetime (25.15 ns) than that of the control sample (63.16 ns), which further proves the faster electron separation and transport rate at the interface of the 2D/3D perovskite.
To further analyze the interfacial charge transfer and recombination process of the control and 2D/3D devices, electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed. The impedance spectra were measured in the dark. The equivalent circuit model (inset of Fig. 6a) is given to simulate the charge transfer and recombination process, where Rs is defined as the series resistance and indicates the energy lost during the process of charge carrier transport and Rrec represents the recombination resistance, which is inversely proportional to the photogenerated carrier recombination rate. The Nyquist plots of the control and 2D/3D devices measured without applied voltage are shown in Fig. 6a. As seen, the 2D/3D device shows a reduced Rs value and an increased Rrec value, signifying the enhanced charge carrier transfer ability and inhibited interfacial charge recombination.5 The impedance spectra (Fig. 6b) were also measured at different applied voltages, and the 2D/3D device exhibits increased Rrec values for all the investigated voltages, further proving the suppressed interfacial charge recombination and thus leading to the improvement of FF, Voc and Jsc. The dark J–V curves of the devices are presented in Fig. 6c, and the 2D/3D device shows a lower leakage current than the control device, which further reveals the reduced recombination and improved charge carrier transportation.

To investigate the effects of the 2D perovskite interface layer on the built-in potential (Vbi) of the PSCs, capacitance–voltage measurements were conducted. The capacitance–voltage (C−2–V) plots are presented in Fig. 6d, and the Vbi values can be extracted according to Mott–Schottky equation: (3)where C represents the capacitance of the space charge region, q is the elementary electron, ε represents the relative permittivity, ε0 represents the vacuum permittivity, N represents the charge density, and V represents the applied bias. A larger Vbi value indicates an enhanced driving force of photogenerated carrier charge separation and an enlarged depletion region for suppressed carrier recombination.56 The 2D/3D device shows a higher Vbi value than the control device, suggesting that carrier recombination is hindered at the perovskite/carbon interface after using the 2D perovskite as an interface modification layer. The charge density N value is inversely proportional to the slope of the tangent line of the plot. As seen, the 2D/3D device exhibits a higher slope than that of the control device, which confirms the lower charge density at the interface, indicating the improved charge transfer. In addition, the 2D/3D device exhibits a smaller capacitance value at the same bias voltage, further demonstrating that the formed heterostructure reduces charge accumulation and improves carrier transport at the interface of the devices, which is ascribed to the optimized energy level arrangement.
As a vital part of PSC technology, a key metric for evaluating practical applications is stability. Thus, the stability of the perovskite samples and the corresponding devices was systematically investigated. XRD measurements were performed to investigate the stability of perovskite samples, and the samples were stored in the dark for 1000 h at 20% relative humidity (RH) in air. As seen in Fig. 7a and b, clear PbI2 peaks were observed in the control 3D perovskite films but were barely recognized in the 2D/3D perovskite films, and there are no obvious intensity changes of the 2D perovskite peaks in the 2D/3D samples, which suggests that the 2D/3D perovskite has an improved long-term stability compared to the control sample. Moreover, UV-vis absorption spectra were also used to evaluate the stability of perovskite samples. As shown in Fig. 7c, the 2D/3D perovskite films maintain a better light absorption after aging for 1000 h than the control sample, which further proves the improved storage stability of the 2D/3D perovskite films. The long-term stability of the corresponding devices was investigated by measuring the PCE evolution as a function of storage time, and the devices were stored in the same conditions as the above perovskite films. As exhibited in Fig. 7d, the device based on the 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction retained more than 90% of its initial PCE after storage for 1000 h in the ambient environment, while the control device drops to 60% of its initial PCE after about 500 h. These results demonstrate that the stability of the 2D/3D perovskite films and the corresponding devices are substantially improved compared to the control samples, which is mainly attributed to the increased hydrophobicity from the introduction of the 2D perovskite modified layer, demonstrated by the water contact angle measurements shown inset in Fig. 7a and b.

Commercial carbon paste was purchased from Shanghai MaterWin New Material Co., Ltd.
Fabrication of PSCs
The PSCs were fabricated using FTO glass as the conductive substrate. Firstly, FTO glass substrates were etched with 2 M HCl and zinc powder, and then washed with ultrapure water, acetone, isopropanol and ethanol, respectively. For the deposition of compact TiO2 films, a mildly acidic solution of titanium isopropoxide in ethanol (350 μL in 5 mL of ethanol containing 0.013 M hydrochloric acid) was spin-coated onto the FTO substrate at 2000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 500 °C for 30 min. The 3D MAPbI3 perovskite thin films were prepared by a one-step spin-coating method with chlorobenzene as the antisolvent in ambient environment at 15–25% RH. The MAPbI3 precursor was fabricated by dissolving 1.25 mmol PbI2 and 1.25 mmol MAI in 1 mL DMF and DMSO (4:1, v/v) mixed solution, followed by stirring at 60 °C for 1 hour. MAPbI3 films were then prepared according to the following procedure: firstly, the perovskite precursor was spin-coated onto compact TiO2 films at 500 rpm for 5 s and 4000 rpm for 20 s. Then, 0.5 mL chlorobenzene was dropped on the samples while the machine was spinning at 4000 rpm for 10 s. After spin coating, the substrates were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The 2D (PhDMA)MA3Pb4I13 perovskite thin films were prepared by the following procedure: 0.1 mol PhDMADI, 0.3 mmol MAI, and 0.4 mmol PbI2 were dissolved in 0.8 mL of a DMF/DMSO (9:1, v/v) mixed solvent, then the precursor solution was spin-coated onto the FTO substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s. After spin-coating, the film was quickly transferred to a hotplate and pre-annealed at 40 °C for 3 min. The 2D/3D perovskite samples were prepared by a solid-state hot-pressure method, and the corresponding fabrication process is as follows: 2D perovskite films were stacked on the top of 3D perovskite films, bringing their surfaces in contact; subsequently, perpendicular pressure and heat were applied to the substrate surface to fabricate a 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction. The samples were retained under 60 MPa for 20 min, and meanwhile, the heat-pressure temperatures were also applied to the samples (40 °C, 60 °C, and 80 °C). The pressure was provided by a hydraulic machine (Auplex, AR1701), which can provide both temperature and pressure simultaneously. Then, the 2D/3D samples were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. Lastly, the carbon electrodes were printed on the samples by a screen-printing method, and then placed in a drying oven at 100 °C for 20 min.
Characterizations
The crystalline properties were investigated by an X-ray diffraction apparatus (Bruker AXS, D8 Focus, Germany). The morphologies were observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi, S-4800, Japan). The absorption spectra were recorded using an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-3101PC). The UPS measurement was performed using an AXIS ULTRA DLD (Kratos) multitechnique system with a photon source energy of 21.22 eV. PL spectra were measured with a Raman spectrometer (Jobin Yvon) using a 488 nm laser as the excitation source. TRPL spectra measurements were carried out using an Edinburgh FLS920 system with the emission at 770 nm. Current–voltage (J–V) curves were produced using an electrochemical workstation (CHI650E) under the illumination of an AM 1.5G solar simulator (Newport 94023A). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (measured at a frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz, in dark) and Mott–Schottky plots (measured at the frequency of 10 kHz) were also accomplished using the electrochemical workstation.
Conclusion
In summary, we report a carbon based HTL-free PSC based on a 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction fabricated by a solid-state heat-pressure method. The DJ-type 2D perovskite (PhDMA)MA3Pb4I13 with accurate composition and structure was introduced to regulate the energy level arrangement and improve stability. The energy level arrangement of the perovskite/carbon was optimized by the formation of a type II band alignment structure, and the stability of the samples is enhanced due to the excellent hydrophobicity of the 2D perovskite materials. Moreover, the light absorption ability of the sample is not sacrificed because of the similar band gap between 3D (MAPbI3) perovskite and 2D ((PhDMA)MA3Pb4I13) perovskite. Thus, interfacial charge recombination loss is reduced, thus enhancing the stability of the devices. As a result, the best performing carbon-based HTL-free PSC based on 2D/3D perovskite shows a PCE of 15.63%, which is significantly higher than that of the control 3D device. The 2D/3D device also shows an improved long-term stability, maintaining 90% of its initial performance after aging for 1000 hours in ambient environment.
