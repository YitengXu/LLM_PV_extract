The electron transport layers were prepared from a suspension consisting of titania nanoparticles and a novel organo-silica binder. The layers are post-processed by low temperature UV curing instead of thermal annealing. The UV-cured TiO2 layers were applied in inverted-structure organic bulk heterojunction solar cells with the active layer from a PCDTBT:PC60BM blend. These devices achieved a power conversion efficiency comparable to devices with TiO2 layers prepared by the common sol–gel process relying on high-temperature calcination. Thus the novel UV curable TiO2 formulation is promising as printable electron transport layers for flexible devices, which are not compatible with thermal processing.
Introduction
Printed (organic) electronics are believed to be among the key technologies that will help to overcome several challenges that the world faces for decades to come, such as energy supply, environmental sustainability, health and demographics, industry, etc.1 Organic electronics enables the use of bio-analogical materials and the building of fundamentally new devices that have no analogy in traditional electronics.2–4 What is probably more important in the short term, is that it enables novel approaches to manufacturing electronics, leading to thin, lightweight, flexible, environmentally friendly, and easily directly integrated low-cost products such as printed organic solar cells.5–7
Today, the photogeneration efficiency of organic solar cells (OSC) exceeds 10%, especially due to a series of new electron donor materials and the optimization of photovoltaic devices' structure.8 This achievement has gradually resulted in research attention being focused on the fabrication of mechanically flexible, large-footprint photovoltaic devices by modified printing methods. Nevertheless, it requires that a solution be found for problems connected with wet-coating of thin films, both the active and auxiliary materials, to achieve a full printable structure for a photovoltaic device.
Wet-coating of auxiliary materials is often specific, because in many cases the deposited material, though ultimately inorganic, requires preparation from an organometallic precursor which has to be converted into the final form in order to achieve the optimal chemical and physical properties. This is true especially in the case of metal oxides such as TiO2, ZnO and others, which are beneficial for improving the photogeneration efficiency of photovoltaic devices by facilitating the charge extraction from the active layer to the cell electrodes. These metal oxide transport layers are chemically stable and work also as a barrier against humidity and oxygen, thus improving the lifetime of the photovoltaic devices.8 This work is focused on the TiO2 layers as a representative example of this group of materials.
Two distinct approaches to fabrication of the TiO2 layer by wet-coating methods can be identified: the first approach is based on the sol–gel process, i.e., soluble titanium salts and/or titanium alkoxides are complexed by suitable chelates, pre-crosslinked by partial hydrolysis, and the resulting metastable colloidal sols are then coated onto a substrate, gelled, and converted into dense or porous oxide layers.9 Thermal calcination (with a treatment temperature of over 400 °C)10 is the most common way to achieve this conversion. This approach is surely inappropriate if the TiO2 layer is going to be prepared on plastic or another organic substrate. For example, the most common PET foils usually suffer from mechanical deformation at temperatures higher than 100 °C.11 Low-temperature alternatives to thermal calcination do exist, but they require other “extreme conditions” such as high pressure.12
Much experimental attention has also been paid to the second possible approach leading to printed TiO2 films. This alternative route is based on the synthesis of stable colloidal suspensions of nanocrystalline TiO2 followed by the delivery of this suspension onto a substrate by some of the numerous wet-coating techniques.
The application of this approach to preparation of a TiO2 layer incorporated into an OSC structure has been previously described in various papers.13,14 These layers are usually treated at a temperature around 130 °C. These conditions are the same as for preparation of PEDOT:PSS, which is the most common material for hole transport layers. Due to this, the technology is called “low-temperature”.
The obvious issue inherently associated with this second approach is the adhesion of the deposited material to the substrate. The aggregated nanoparticles left after solvent evaporation have only a very limited adhesion to the substrate and need to be fixed in some way. Heat treatment at 300–500 °C inducing layer annealing is the most common solution to this problem,15 thereby there is no benefit in comparison to the sol–gel process. A great deal of attention has therefore been paid to overcoming the high temperatures, and several interesting processes have been reported so far. The key lies in the mechanisms of building titania layers, and the processes addressing the above-mentioned necessary conditions involved, e.g. UV-curing of a titanium alkoxide binder,16 the incorporation of a mineral binder such as amorphous silica,17 titanium alkoxide decomposition in supercritical carbon dioxide,18 or cold isostatic pressing of standard P-25 grade titania.19
Among these methods, the UV-curing of the deposited “green body” layers seems to be the most suitable for production of large-area flexible photovoltaic devices by printing methods, because it does not require special complex curing devices. UV-curing tunnels are readily available in a wide range of irradiation power densities and spectral power distribution profiles and can be easily added to the deposition line of roll to roll devices.20 The incorporation of UV-curing tunnels has wider use in the treatment of other auxiliary materials such as encapsulating materials21 or graphene oxides.22
Thus, we tested TiO2 layers prepared from dispersions containing titania nanoparticles and an organo-silica binder which has been first reported by Grégori et al.,23 who describe the photocatalytic and mechanical properties of layers prepared from the sol. UV treatment of deposited layers caused the decomposition of methyl groups in the organo-silica matrix. The final structure of the film was very fluffy, with TiO2 particles cemented by silica creating an open-pore network. This structure also gives the layers a mechanical flexibility which is desired for its application in flexible printed devices.
In this work, we describe further development, optimization and application of the titania–silica hybrid interlayers and their incorporation into photovoltaic devices with the active layer prepared from a PCDTBT:PC60BM mix in a 1:4 ratio. PCDTBT (poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)]), which is being intensively studied today, is a low band gap co-polymer with high stability24,25 and PC60BM ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester) is presently the most-used electron acceptor.
Experimental
UV-curable formulation of TiO2
The silica binder was prepared through acid-catalyzed partial hydrolysis of methyltriethoxysilane at low temperature according the procedure described in the work of D. Grégori et al.23 The dry mass content of synthesized binder sol was determined gravimetrically and adjusted to 0.28 g cm−3. For the sake of convenient testing of various silica–titania ratios, a stock dispersion of titanium dioxide in anhydrous ethanol was mixed first, having the same dry mass content as the silica binder solution. The printing formulation was then prepared by mixing varying volumes of silica binder sol, titania dispersion and viscosity-controlling solvent (butanol) in 20 mL glass vials. Approximately 3 g of 1 mm diameter glass balls were added to each vial and they were kept shaking for a minimum of 2 days on an oscillating plate shaker set to 900 rpm in order to break the titania aggregates and reduce the roughness of the resulting coatings.26 The composition of all coating formulations are summarized in Table S1 in the ESI.†
Sol–gel formulation of TiO2
A conventional stock titanium isopropoxide-based sol (Table S2 in the ESI†) was mixed according to the procedure described previously.27 However, this time the composition was altered to include an increased amount of titanium isopropoxide (0.6 mol L−1) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) so that greater dry mass content would be present in the sol and the resulting coating thickness would thus increase to become comparable with the thickness of the nanoparticulate origin layers. The coating formulation was then prepared by mixing 10 mL of the stock sol with 5 mL of hexane-1-ol and 0.2 g of PEG 1000.
TiO2 layer deposition
TiO2 layers were fabricated on glass substrates of 1.5 × 2.5 cm with pre-patterned ITO electrodes, which were supplied by Ossila. Substrates were cleaned for 10 min in 5% NaOH solution, 10 min in deionized water and 10 min in isopropanol of a.p. quality.
The nanoparticulate TiO2 layers were deposited by spin-coating at 3000 rpm. The ball-milled printing formulation was diluted by hexanol (p.a. quality) in 10:200 ratio just prior to coating in order to adjust the dry mass content and corresponding dry layer thickness. Coated substrates were immediately cured by UV under a broadband UV-A/B/C lamp (model 80 BQL7, 248 W, Ultralight AG, Liechtenstein) at ambient conditions or under a lamp (model UVAHAND 250, 250 W, Dr. Hönle AG, UV-Technology, Germany) in a nitrogen atmosphere.
The sol–gel TiO2 layers were deposed by spin-coating at 7000 rpm at ambient conditions. Layers were calcinated at 450 °C for 4 hours.
Photovoltaic devices fabrication
The structure of the prepared photovoltaic devices can be described by the following scheme: glass substrate/ITO/TiO2/active layer/hole transport layer/top electrode.
The active layers of PCDTBT:PC60BM 1:4 were prepared by spin-coating at 2000 rpm from a solution containing 25 mg mL−1 solids dissolved in anhydrous chlorobenzene. PCDTBT was supplied by Ossila and PC60BM by Sigma Aldrich. Layers were annealed at 80 °C for 20 min. Preparation of the active layers was performed in gloveboxes with a controlled nitrogen atmosphere (50 ppm of oxygen). The thickness of the spin-coated layers was (80 ± 10) nm.
The MoO3 hole transport layers were deposited by evaporation in a vacuum chamber (MB-ProVap-5 MBRAUN). The thickness of the MoO3 layers was controlled by a quartz crystal sensor and the final thickness was (12 ± 2) nm.
The top electrode was prepared from aluminium also by evaporation performed in the same vacuum chamber. The thickness was determined to be (100 ± 10) nm by a quartz crystal sensor.
Sample characterization
The thickness of the active layer and electron transport layers as well as the roughness of the electron transport layers were determined by a mechanical profilometer (Bruker DektakXT). The recorded profiles were processed by Vision64 software. The surface roughness was characterized by the calculation of the average roughness parameter Ra:  where l is the evaluation length and Z is the distance from the mean line, which traces a surface shape.
The morphology of the layers was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using field emission microscope JEOL JSM-7600F.
The cleavage of the binder methyl moieties by UV-curing was monitored using FTIR spectroscopy. In order to obtain a stronger FTIR absorption signal, a special set of samples was spin coated onto plain soda-lime glass plates using undiluted stock dispersions producing layers approximately 100 nm thick. Transmission spectra were recorded by Nicolet Impact 400 spectrometer.
The photogeneration efficiency of the fabricated photovoltaic devices was determined by an automated current–voltage measurement station by Keithley (2601B) under the illumination of 100 mW cm−2 delivered by a certified solar simulator (Lot Oriel LS0916 with the AM1.5 filter). External quantum efficiency (EQE) was obtained using a combined apparatus consisting of: Keithley 6478 picoampermeter, LSH502 LOT Oriel xenon lamp, MSH101 LOT ORIEL monochromator, SiQE120 RaRe Solutions photometric head connected to Keithley 485 picoampermeter. The active area of the electrodes defined by aperture was 0.06 cm2.
Results and discussion
Four weigh ratios of TiO2 particles to the silica binder were studied: 60, 70, 80 and 90% of TiO2. With respect to the binding and insulating nature of SiO2, one would expect that a higher concentration of silica would have a positive influence on the cohesion of TiO2 particles in the layer (as reported in ref. 22), but simultaneously a reduction of the electron-transporting properties of the final films could be expected. Therefore, the influence of the TiO2 particle content in the deposited suspension on the key mechanical properties and the associated electrical properties was studied, as was the influence of the deposited TiO2 layers on the overall photogeneration efficiency of the organic photovoltaic devices (OPV).
Process of silica binder curing
The process of binder mineralization during UV-curing was monitored by FTIR spectroscopy. FTIR spectra depicted at Fig. 1 clearly illustrate the changes of relative absorbance of the peaks in the 2850–3000 cm−1 region. It is corresponding to C–H vibrations, which have almost totally disappeared after 5 hours of UV irradiation time. It can be attributed to the photocatalytic cleavage of the residual methyl moieties by the oxidizing effect of UV-irradiated titania. The band with absorption maximum about 3350 cm−1 is corresponding to vibration of H atoms bonded to oxides. This band is after UV light treatment unchanged. Thus the FTIR spectra confirm the elimination of the organic fraction of the binder.

Layers mechanical properties
The average thickness of the TiO2 layers prepared by spin-coating was determined from 3 measurements on different places of the sample (in the center, near to the sample's edge and midway between these two places), to eliminate the variability of the layer thickness with the place of measurement caused by spin-coating. The determined values are summarized in Table 1. The thickness varied from 29 nm in the case of the layer prepared from suspension with 70% TiO2 to 45 nm in the case of the layer prepared from suspension with 90% TiO2. The sol–gel originated TiO2 layer had a similar thickness as the layer prepared from suspension with 70% TiO2. Due to the comparability of results, this is an important piece of information with respect to the following comparison of the photovoltaic conversion efficiency of devices containing these layers for facilitation of electron transport.

The surface roughness of layers is another investigated parameter, because the layers need to be uniform and defect-free for OPV devices to perform optimally.13,28 The surface roughness of the layers was measured by mechanical profilometer in the same way as the thickness was, i.e. on three different places for better mapping of their surface. The determined values of average roughness parameter Ra are summarized Table 1. The UV-treated layers had a roughness of about 10 nm while in the sol–gel processed layers it was only 2 nm. Higher roughness of the UV-treated layers was expected due to the size of the TiO2 primary grains (20 nm) and due to the porous structure of layers simultaneously observed by SEM, see Fig. 2. The surface roughness can be reduced by the usage of smaller nanoparticles.13

Photovoltaic device characterization
The effect of the TiO2 particle content on the electron-transporting properties of the layers was assessed from the parameters of the photovoltaic devices, which were obtained from measurement of current–voltage characteristics. The current density vs. the voltage characteristics of the best electrodes of the studied OPV devices are shown in Fig. 3A. The characteristics of the devices with TiO2 prepared from suspensions are compared with the characteristics of the device with TiO2 prepared by the sol–gel process. The calculated average parameters are summarized in Table 2. There are minimal differences in the values of the studied parameters between devices with TiO2 prepared from suspension with varying content of TiO2 nanoparticles. The values of the short current density were about 5.4 mA cm−2 and the open circuit voltage was approx. 860 mV. The fill factor values varied from 52% for the device made of 60% suspension to 57% for the device made of 70% suspension. The values of this parameter correlate fairly well with the thickness of the layer. The overall photogeneration efficiency of the studied devices was the best in the case of the devices made of 70% suspension and reached 2.8% in this case. The worst photogeneration efficiency came from the device made of 60% suspension and here it dropped to 2.4%. These results show that the higher content of silica in the layer of TiO2, while providing better mechanical properties, doesn't actually affect the photogeneration efficiency of the devices much.

The device made with the sol–gel processed TiO2 layer had similar photogeneration efficiency at 2.6%, see Fig. 3A and Table 2. However, there are some significant differences, e.g. in the case of the short current density parameter, which increased to 6.4 mA cm−2. This difference was also confirmed by the measurement of spectrally resolved photocurrents. The spectra were recalculated to external quantum efficiency (EQE) plots, which are shown in Fig. 3B. The solar cell with the sol–gel processed TiO2 layer shows about 10% higher EQE than the cells with the UV-treated TiO2. On the other hand, the fill factor of the device with the sol–gel processed TiO2 layer was only 47% compared to the UV-treated TiO2, which achieved up to 57%. These characteristics illustrate the advantages and simultaneous disadvantages of the sol–gel TiO2 layers in comparison with the newly reported nanoparticle-based ones. The silica binder, which provides better adhesion between TiO2 particles and to ITO caused a photocurrent loss due to its electrically insulating. Simultaneously, the porosity of the nanoparticle-based TiO2 layers is causing smaller contact area with the ITO electrode for transfer of electrons. On other hand, the porosity allows a better interfacial contact with active layer and thus better extraction of electrons from the active layer. Thus, the overall contribution of porosity to the photogeneration efficiency is the result of the equilibrium between these two phenomena.
Another factor is the adhesion of organic layers to TiO2, which is generally rather poor as was shown by D. Yu et al.29 who studied the adhesion forces between various part of inverted organic solar cells by atomic force microscopy. Simultaneously it was found that silica provides better adhesion to organic compounds due to its hydrophobic nature.30,31 Stronger adhesion between layers can also influence serial resistivity on the interface and contributes to a higher value of short current density and fill factor. The positive influence of SiO2 particles in nanoimprinted ZnO layer on the photogeneration efficiency in OPV was observed by H.-Y. Yang et al.32 Poor adhesion is probably the reason for the reduction of the fill factor of the OPV device made from the sol–gel processed TiO2 layer.
The thermal treatment of the sol–gel originating TiO2 layer at 450 °C is another factor contributing to the reduction of the observed fill factor. The high temperature is causing the degradation of the ITO electrode as was reported in other studies.13,33
The studied TiO2 layers prepared from suspension were processed by UV radiation for 20 min. The duration of this processing was chosen according to an irradiation dose test which was carried out separately and which was processed on layers prepared from 80% TiO2 dispersion. The layers were irradiated in intervals ranging from 0 min to 5 hours. The parameters of photovoltaic devices using the TiO2 layers for various irradiation times are shown in Fig. 4 (for current–voltage curves see ESI†). We found that 15 min of irradiation time provides sufficient dose for 40 nm thick layers and that longer treatment did not cause any other effect on the performance of the prepared photovoltaic devices. The UV radiation treatment was tested at ambient conditions as well as in a nitrogen atmosphere. The devices with 80% TiO2 treated by UV radiation in nitrogen have a similar quality as devices with a TiO2 interlayer treated in air, see the plot in the ESI.† The average photogeneration efficiency of the device with a TiO2 layer treated in ambient air was (2.5 ± 0.1)%, while for the devices treated in nitrogen it was (2.3 ± 0.2)% (for current–voltage characteristics see the ESI†). The possibility of annealing the nanoparticulate titania layers in a nitrogen atmosphere enables carrying out the complete fabrication sequence in a nitrogen atmosphere. This constitutes an important advantage over the conventional sol–gel layers which require annealing in air in order to oxidize the organic fraction of the xerogel network.34 Obviously, the introduction of oxygen and the generation of gaseous pyrolytic products in the OPV fabrication facility isn't favorable at all. Moreover, the deposition of the TiO2 transport layer from the liquid phase further facilitates the prospective upscaling and employment of this process in large scale roll-to-roll coating plants.

Conclusions
In this contribution we reported on the preparation of titania–silica films via a low-temperature process and their application as the electron-transporting layer in organic photovoltaic devices.
The reported formulations enabled the fabrication of hybrid titania–silica layers by any of the well-known wet coating techniques. Moreover, they are also suitable for direct patterning by material printing techniques. Apart from conventional thermal fixing, these layers can be effectively fixed by UV curing under low temperature. These attributes make them particularly suitable for application in the field of printed flexible electronic devices.
The photovoltaic devices with these films showed a photogeneration efficiency of 2.5%, which was comparable to the devices containing TiO2 transport layers prepared by a conventional sol–gel process.
