    , Accepted 8th October 2020First published on 9th October 2020AbstractFour new main-chain-twisted acceptor–donor–acceptor-type (A–D–A) non-fullerene acceptors (i-mO-4F, i-mO-4Cl, i-pO-4F, and i-pO-4Cl) were designed and synthesized, featuring the introduction of meta-hexyloxy-phenyl and para-hexyloxy-phenyl side-chains in the fused-ring core as well as 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile and 2-(5,6-dichlorine-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile as the end-capping groups. All four small molecules exhibited broad absorption spectra in the range of 300 nm to 820 nm with a corresponding small optical bandgap of 1.55 eV (i-mO-4F), 1.53 eV (i-mO-4Cl), 1.52 eV (i-pO-4F), and 1.48 eV (i-pO-4Cl), which ensured total complementary absorption with a wide bandgap polymer donor material (PBDB-T). Although i-mO-4Cl possessed a finely bathochromic-shifted absorption spectrum, its poor morphology with PBDB-T in the blend films led to a low power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.41%. In contrast, the optimal PBDB-T:i-mO-4F-, PBDB-T:i-pO-4F-, and PBDB-T:i-pO-4Cl-based devices achieved promising PCEs of 14.02%, 13.47%, and 10.98%, respectively. The obtained significantly different results for these two types of NFAs, on the one hand, demonstrate the synergistic effect of the hexyloxy-phenyl side-chain modification and non-planar main-chain strategy to construct highly efficient non-fullerene acceptors for polymer solar cells, and on the other hand, reveal the influence of the fluorinated and chlorinated end-groups on the morphologies and performances of the resultant main-chain-twisted NFAs.
Introduction
In the past few years, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) using non-fullerene small molecule electron acceptors (NFAs) have attracted much interest from researchers due to their complementary absorption with electron donors (either π-conjugated polymers or small molecules), easily modulated molecular energy levels, and better aggregation behavior in the active layer in comparison with the fullerene-based electron acceptors.1–7 To date, due to the application of elaborately optimized polymer donors with a variety of structurally modified acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A)-type small molecule acceptors, highly efficient PSCs have achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼17% both in single-layer devices8–15 and in a tandem solar cells.16 Although most of the reported high-efficiency A–D–A NFAs in the literature have planar main-chain configurations, the recently reported non-planar acceptors exhibit promising performances both in binary and ternary devices17–28 due to their up-shifted molecular energy levels, superior charge extraction properties, and longer exciton lifetime, providing a new approach to construct highly efficient A–D–A NFAs for PSCs.
In conjugated materials, side-chain engineering is a promising approach to adjust the molecular energy levels and absorptive characteristics both in conjugated D–A polymers and A–D–A-type NFAs.29–34 In A–D–A NFAs having an indacenodithiophene (IDT) fused-ring as the electron-donating unit, four para-hexyl-phenyl groups are commonly applied as the side-chains to improve the solubility of the materials in solvents and restrict the over-aggregation and excessive phase separation in BHJ blend films.35 Compared to the para-hexyl-phenyl group, the hexyloxy-phenyl substituents in the IDT core possess relatively strong electron-donating ability, which is favorable for the absorptive properties and energy levels adjustment of the resultant materials.36–38 Several meta-hexyloxy-phenyl modified IDT-based NFAs have been synthesized and achieved stronger intermolecular π–π-stacking interactions, higher extinction coefficients, increased crystallinity, and improved electron mobilities compared to their para-hexyl-phenyl-substituted counterparts,39–41 leading to the promotion of photovoltaic performances in PSCs.
Inspired by the alkoxy-phenyl modification strategy and excellent performances of main-chain-twisted NFAs, to further investigate the association between the photovoltaic performances and the structural characterizations of twisted molecules, herein, we synthesized a new non-planar small molecular acceptor (i-mO-4F), which is the meta-hexyloxy-phenyl-modified congener of i-IEICO-4F.17 Additionally, considering the excellent performances of the chlorinated end-group-substituted NFAs (such as IT-4Cl and IEICO-4Cl) in PSCs,42–44 to expand the absorption spectrum and modulate the molecular energy levels of i-mO-4F, we also synthesized its chlorinated analog (i-mO-4Cl) for comparison. The molecular structures of i-mO-4F and i-mO-4Cl are presented in Fig. 1a.

The resultant two molecules exhibited finely tunable molecular energy levels with adjusted absorption properties. In comparison with i-IEICO-4F, i-mO-4F and i-mO-4Cl possessed slightly lower optical bandgaps. When blended with the wide bandgap donor polymer PBDB-T45 (Fig. 1a) in inverted structure devices, the best i-IEICO-4F and i-mO-4Cl devices exhibited a PCE of 13.17% and 7.41%, respectively. However, a high PCE of 14.02% with a high open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.916 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 21.55 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 71.1% were successfully achieved in the i-mO-4F-based device. Besides, two para-hexyloxy-phenyl modified molecules, i-pO-4F and i-pO-4Cl, were further synthesized to investigate the performances of the alkoxy-modified twisted NFAs in PSCs. The same tendency in the absorption behaviors, molecular energy levels, and film morphologies with PBDB-T was also observed in these two NFAs, leading to a high PCE of 13.47% in the i-pO-4F-based device and a moderate PCE of 10.98% in the i-pO-4Cl-based device. It should be noted that the PCEs of the acceptors (i-mO-4F and i-pO-4F) are among two of the highest results of PBDB-T-based binary devices to date,46–57 illustrating the effectiveness of para-hexyloxy-phenyl and meta-hexyloxy-phenyl side-chain engineering and the non-planar main-chain strategy to build high-performance NFAs for PSCs. However, the distinctly different performances between the fluorinated- and chlorinated types of NFAs reveal the significant impacts of different terminal groups on the morphologies and performances of the resultant main-chain-twisted NFAs.
Results and discussion
Material synthesis and characterization
Employing quantum chemistry calculations, two meta-hexyloxy-phenyl-modified acceptors (i-mO-4F and i-mO-4Cl) were designed via density functional theory (DFT) with the B3LYP/6-31G* basis set.58 The alkyl and alkoxy side chains were replaced by methyl and methoxy groups for simplification. We also calculated the geometry of i-IEICO-4F (Fig. S1 and S2†) under the same simplification condition to avoid unnecessary interference of the long alkyl and alkoxy side chains17 (Table S1†). Fig. 1b and Tables S1 and S2† exhibit the optimized molecular geometries of i-IEICO-4F, i-mO-4F and i-mO-4Cl, and their frontier molecular orbitals. These three molecules exhibit twisted geometries, showing four dihedral angles (θ1–θ4) of 6.77°, 17.79°, 17.80° and 6.78° for i-IEICO-4F (Fig. S2†), 6.01°, 16.78°, 16.79° and 6.02° for i-mO-4F, and 6.61°, 17.19°, 17.19° and 6.61° for i-mO-4Cl, respectively. The twisted degrees of i-mO-4F and i-mO-4Cl are slightly less than that of i-IEICO-4F, implying the meta-hexyloxy substitute is beneficial for the planarity of the molecules to some extent. Additionally, the fluorinated acceptor i-mO-4F possesses slightly lower dihedral angles relative to that of i-mO-4Cl, illustrating the substituents on the terminal groups can also affect the planarity of the acceptors. Compared to the calculated lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level (−3.34 eV) of i-IEICO-4F (Table S2†), the LUMO level of i-mO-4F is slightly up-shifted to −3.30 eV, while that of i-mO-4Cl is down-shifted to −3.39 eV, suggesting the side-chain modification can influence the VOC of the two acceptor-based devices. Furthermore, the calculated highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of i-mO-4F and i-mO-4Cl are −4.97 eV and −5.01 eV, resulting in a corresponding bandgap of 1.67 eV and 1.62 eV, respectively. Relative to the calculated bandgap of i-IEICO-4F (1.71 eV), the reduced bandgaps of the two acceptors are indicative of better long-wavelength sunlight absorption ability, which is conducive to the JSC in PSCs. Meanwhile, according to the calculated data, the dipole moments of i-IEICO-4F, i-mO-4F, and i-mO-4Cl were determined to be 0.0014, 0.2040, and 0.1722 Debye (D), respectively, indicating the higher polarities of the two meta-hexyloxy-phenyl-modified acceptors.
The synthetic routes toward i-mO-4F and i-mO-4Cl are shown in Scheme 1. The meta-hexyloxy-phenyl-modified IDT-based organic tin compound 1 was synthesized and purified according to the method in the literature.59 Through the Stille coupling reaction of compound 1 with 5-bromo-4-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)thiophene-3-carbaldehyde in toluene at 90 °C for 14 h,17 the key dialdehyde intermediate (M1) was successfully achieved as a red solid (72.5%). Then the target molecules i-mO-4F (66.9%) and i-mO-4Cl (42.8%) were obtained via Knoevenagel reaction between M1 and 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (2F-INCN) or 2-(5,6-dichlorine-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (2Cl-INCN) as black solids, respectively. The structures of M1 and the two acceptors were systematically characterized via elemental analysis, 1H NMR, and 13C NMR (Fig. S3–S8†). The obtained i-mO-4F and i-mO-4Cl were easily dissolved in common solvents (chlorobenzene, chloroform, and o-dichlorobenzene) with high concentration (>20 mg mL−1), ensuring the fabrication of their films by a solution process. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), as shown in Fig. S15,† indicates that i-mO-4F and i-mO-4Cl are thermally thermal stable up to 327 °C and 342 °C, respectively (5 wt% loss).

Absorption properties and molecular energy levels
The absorption spectra of the two acceptors in chloroform solutions are shown in Fig. 2a. The solution of i-mO-4F exhibits an absorption peak at 704 nm, which is red-shifted by about 14 nm for the i-mO-4Cl solution, indicating the chlorination in the ending group is instrumental in the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). To match the absorption spectra of these two acceptors, the polymer PBDB-T was chosen as the electron donor because of its relatively wide bandgap and promising photovoltaic performances with NFAs.45 The absorption spectra of the PBDB-T, i-mO-4F, and i-mO-4Cl pure films on quartz are shown in Fig. 2b. The i-MO-4F and i-mO-4Cl films exhibit slightly red-shifted spectra compared to that of i-IEICO-4F (Fig. S16†). The absorption edges (λedges) of i-mO-4F and i-mO-4Cl are located at 801 and 811 nm, with the corresponding optical bandgap (Eg) of 1.55 and 1.53 eV, respectively. The slightly reduced bandgaps of i-mO-4F and i-mO-4Cl are in good accordance with the DFT calculation results. Consequently, truly complementary absorptions between the two acceptors and PBDB-T were achieved, implying that both electron acceptors may have good performances in PSCs with PBDB-T.

Through the typical three-electrode measurement, using Ag/Ag+ as a reference and Fc/Fc+ as a standard, electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements of i-mO-4F and i-mO-4Cl were conducted to study their HOMO and LUMO energy levels. As seen in Fig. 2c, the onset potentials of reduction (ϕred) are located at −0.90 V for i-mO-4F and −0.88 V for i-mO-4Cl, respectively. Therefore, the LUMO levels (ELUMOs) of these two molecules were determined to be −3.81 eV for i-mO-4F and −3.83 eV for i-mO-4Cl.60i-MO-4F possesses an up-shifted LUMO energy level relative to that of i-mO-4Cl (−3.79 eV) and i-IEICO-4F (−3.82 eV),18 which is instrumental in achieving a higher VOC.61 The HOMO energy levels (EHOMOs) of i-mO-4F and i-mO-4Cl were −5.50 and −5.55 eV, respectively. The CV of the PBDB-T film was also measured, as shown in Fig. S17,† and the obtained EHOMO/ELUMO was −5.26/−3.16 eV. Thus, the obvious energy offsets between i-mO-4F (or i-mO-4Cl) and PBDB-T are large enough to ensure effective exciton dissociation. Fig. 2d shows a schematic illustration of the molecular energy levels of PBDB-T, i-IEICO-4F, i-mO-4F, and i-mO-4Cl, while the collected absorption parameters and electrochemical properties of the three acceptors are shown in Table 1.

Photovoltaic properties, exciton generation, and recombination mechanisms
The photovoltaic performances of the two acceptors were evaluated using PBDB-T as the electron-donor material by fabricating a series of solar cells with an inverted device configuration (ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T:acceptors/MoO3/Al). The active layer was spin-coated from a chlorobenzene (CB) solution of PBDB-T with i-mO-4F or i-mO-4Cl. To optimize the device performances, the donor/acceptor weight ratio of 1:1 upon different thermal annealing (TA) processes (as cast, 110 °C for 10 min, 130 °C for 10 min, 150 °C for 10 min and 170 °C for 10 min) was employed. It was found that the simple 150 °C treatment without any additives could effectively enhance the performances of the devices (Table S3†). The current density–voltage (J–V) plots of the optimized TA-treated devices for i-mO-4F and i-mO-4Cl are shown in Fig. 3a, with the calculated photovoltaic parameters in Table 2. For better comparison, we also fabricated a PBDB-T:i-IEICO-4F-based device under the same conditions and the J–V curve is plotted in Fig. S18.† The optimal PBDB-T:i-IEICO-4F-based device exhibited a high PCE of 13.17% (Table S4†), which rivals the efficiency of the J52:i-IEICO-4F-based device17 but with a slightly improved VOC (0.898 V), which originated from the deepened HOMO level of PBDB-T. For the best i-mO-4F-based device, a slightly improved VOC (0.916 V), JSC (21.55 mA cm−2), and FF (71.1%) were simultaneously achieved, leading to an excellent PCE of 14.02%. For the i-mO-4Cl-based device, its low VOC (0.872 V), JSC (15.08 mA cm−2), and FF (56.4%) resulted in an inferior PCE of 7.41%, which was significantly lower than that of i-IEICO-4F, and other chlorinated acceptor-based devices.42–44 The reason for the unsatisfactory performance of the i-mO-4Cl-based device is mainly due to its poor morphology, which will be illustrated below. Among the three acceptors, the i-mO-4F-based device exhibited the biggest VOC and the i-mO-4Cl-based device possessed the smallest VOC, which are consistent with their ELUMO values. The average PCE of the PBDB-T:i-mO-4F-based device over 15 individual PSCs was 13.85 ± 0.17%, demonstrating the good repeatability and excellent performance of this donor:acceptor system.

To elucidate the photoresponses of the devices based on the two small molecular acceptors, the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the PBDB-T:i-mO-4F- and PBDB-T:i-mO-4Cl-based devices are depicted in Fig. 3b, in which both devices show strong and wide photoresponses from the ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (NIR) region (300–820 nm). The device based on i-mO-4F showed much stronger EQE spectra relative to that of the i-mO-4Cl-based devices, agreeing well with its enhanced JSC. Although a slight structural modification was applied in these two NFAs, the largely enhanced device performances, especially the significantly improved JSC of the i-mO-4F-based devices can be ascribed to the better morphology of the i-mO-4F-based blend film compared to that of the i-mO-4Cl-based blend (the details will be discussed below).
To further investigate the exciton generation and charge collection behaviors, the dependence of the photocurrent density (Jph) on the effective voltage (Veff)62 in the two acceptor-based devices was measured (Fig. 3c). The ratio of Jph/Jsat calculated from the i-mO-4F-based devices is 0.964, which is bigger than that of the i-mO-4Cl-based device (0.933) under short circuit conditions. Furthermore, the i-mO-4F-based device also gave a higher Jph/Jsat value (0.855) than that of the i-mO-4Cl-based device (0.715) under the maximuml power output conditions. The higher exciton dissociation together with the more efficient charge collection efficiency in the i-mO-4F-based device led to its better device performances.
To explore the charge recombination performances of the two devices, the relationship between the obtained JSC and the given incident light intensity (P) was studied, as presented in Fig. 3d. All the devices showed the correlation of JSC ∝ Pα,62 with α values of 0.973 for the i-mO-4F-based device and 0.950 for the i-mO-4Cl-based device. The higher α value in the i-mO-4F-based device indicates a lower bimolecular recombination, which is beneficial to the JSC and FF. To probe the device differences for these two meta-hexyloxy-phenyl-modified twisted NFAs, the charge carrier mobilities were determined using the space charge limited current (SCLC),63 with the measured curves presented in Fig. S19.† The hole (μh) and electron mobilities (μe) of the i-mO-4F-based device are 2.87 × 10−4 and 2.21 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, with a low μh/μe ratio of 1.23. For the i-mO-4Cl-based device, relatively low μh (1.66 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and μe (5.08 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) were observed, together with a high μh/μe ratio (3.27). Consequently, the more balanced and improved μh and μe of the i-mO-4F-based device are ascribed to its better JSC and FF.
Morphological properties
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) were used to probe the surface morphology of the two acceptor-based blend films. The AFM and TEM images under optimal conditions are shown in Fig. 4. The film of the i-mO-4F blend shows a smooth and uniform surface, having a small root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.53 nm. However, a large roughness (5.06 nm) was found for the i-mO-4Cl-based film, indicating the over-aggregation of the donor or acceptor in the blend. In the AFM phase photographs (Fig. 4b and d), the two blends both exhibit an interpenetrating fabric network morphology. However, the i-mO-4Cl film shows an enlarged fiber-like structure, suggesting its big phase separation size relative to the i-mO-4F blend. The enlarged phase separation of the i-mO-4Cl blend was also observed in the TEM images (Fig. 4f and g), which is unfavorable for effective charge separation and transportation. Thus, the nanofibril features and proper domain size in the PBDB-T:i-mO-4F blend film are advantageous for charge separation and transportation, leading to its higher JSC and FF.

To investigate the molecular orientation and crystallization of the two pure acceptors films and their blend films, we performed grazing incident wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXs) measurements.64 The GIWAX line profiles and the corresponding 2D patterns are shown in Fig. 5a and b, respectively. For the pure i-mO-4F and i-mO-4Cl films, the molecular orientation and crystallinity are extremely different. The i-mO-4F film exhibits a face-on dominant orientation, as proven by the prominent (010) π–π stacking peaks in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction. However, the i-mO-4Cl film exhibits a pronounced (010) π–π stacking peak in the in-plane (IP) direction, suggesting an edge-on dominant orientation. Besides, compared to the i-mO-4F film, the i-mO-4Cl film shows many scattering peaks in both the IP and OOP directions, which indicates that the degree of crystallinity of the i-mO-4Cl film is high. For the two acceptor-based blend films, the molecular orientation and crystallinity are still very different. The i-mO-4F-based blend films also show a face-on dominant orientation, while the i-mO-4Cl-based blend films show a mixture of face-on and edge-on orientation. The face-on orientation is known to be more beneficial for the dissociation of exciton and charge transport.65 Moreover, by thermal annealing treatment, both the i-mO-4F-based and i-mO-4Cl-based blend films exhibit enhanced crystallinity, as evidenced by the enhanced scattering peaks for both blend films, which contribute to the higher FF of both the i-mO-4F-based and i-mO-4Cl-based devices with TA treatment. In particular, the PBDB-T:i-mO-4F blend film exhibits stronger (100) lamellar stacking peaks at q ≈ 0.29 Å−1 (for PBDB-T) and q ≈ 0.32 Å−1 (for acceptor) in the IP direction, showing that the crystallinity of both PBDB-T and i-mO-4F increased with TA, resulting in the enhancement of both hole and electron mobility (Table S4†). Furthermore, to probe the phase separation of the optimized i-mO-4F-based and i-mO-4Cl-based films, we performed resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS)66 to gain high scattering contrast for PBDB-T and the two acceptors. Fig. 5c shows the RSoXS profiles of the i-mO-4F and i-mO-4Cl blend films with 150 °C TA treatment. Obviously, there is a big difference in the peak location between the PBDB-T:i-mO-4F and PBDB-T:i-mO-4Cl films. The phase separation of the PBDB-T:i-mO-4Cl film is too large, resulting in too much recombination in the process of exciton diffusion,67 and consequently the poor performance of the i-mO-4Cl-based devices.

Performances of para-modified twisted acceptors
To further investigate the performances of the alkoxy side-chain-modified twisted NFAs, we also synthesized two new para-hexyloxy-phenyl-substituted NFAs, namely i-pO-4F and i-pO-4Cl. The chemical structures of i-pO-4F and i-pO-4Cl are shown in Fig. 6a. These two acceptors also have twisted main-chains, having four dihedral angles (θ1–θ4) of 6.38°, 17.84°, 17.43° and 6.09° for i-pO-4F (Fig. S21†) and 6.32°, 17.95°, 17.48° and 6.02° for i-pO-4Cl (Fig. S22†), respectively. The twisted degree of the two chlorinated molecules slightly increased relative to their fluorinated analogue. The calculated LUMO energy level of i-pO-4F is −3.33 eV, while that of i-pO-4Cl is −3.42 eV, showing the same tendency as that of the two meta-substituted acceptors. The fluorinated NFA i-pO-4F has λmax at 709 nm (Fig. S23 and Table S8†), while that of i-pO-4Cl is 720 nm. Besides, the film of the chlorinated material i-pO-4Cl shows an absorption edge of 836 nm (Fig. 6b), which is 18 nm bathochromic-shifted relative to that of i-pO-4F film (818 nm), resulting in a low bandgap of 1.48 eV. The CV plots show the LUMO energy level of i-pO-4F is −3.82 eV, while that of i-pO-4Cl is −3.84 eV (Fig. S24†). As seen in Fig. 6c and Table 3, the PSCs based on PBDB-T as the donor material and i-pO-4F as the acceptor material achieved a VOC of 0.898 V, JSC of 20.94 mA cm−2, and FF of 71.6%, resulting in a PCE of 13.47%, which is slightly lower than that of the i-mO-4F-based device but still higher than that of the i-IEICO-4F-based device. In contrast, although the performances of the i-pO-4Cl-based device could be improved through the addition of 0.5% chloronaphthalene (CN) to the blend (Fig. S25 and Table S9†), it exhibited a slightly lower EQE photoresponse (Fig. 6d), and simultaneously suppressed VOC, JSC, and FF, leading to a moderated PCE of 10.98%.

AFM was also used to investigate the morphologies of these two para-substituted acceptors-based blend films (Fig. 7). Like the meta-modified acceptor-based blends, the PBDB-T:i-pO-4F film shows a smooth surface, with a small RMS roughness of 1.56 nm, while the RMS roughness of the PBDB-T:i-pO-4Cl TA-treated film increased to 2.93 nm (Fig. S26†). After the addition of 0.5% CN, the RMS roughness of the i-pO-4Cl film decreased to 1.75 nm, slightly higher than that of the PBDB-T:i-pO-4F blend. The lower RMS roughness of the optimized PBDB-T:i-pO-4Cl blend is ascribed to the reduction of the PBDB-T aggregation in the blend, as evidenced by the observed lower μh after the addition of CN (Fig. S27 and Table S10†). However, the μh/μe ratio (1.37) of the optimized PBDB-T:i-pO-4Cl is indicative of balanced charge mobilities, which may be ascribed to the acquired enhanced performance after the addition of CN. In contrast, the improved and more balanced charge mobilities (μh/μe = 1.20) of the PBDB-T:i-pO-4F film resulted in its better device performance. Despite the difference in their film roughness, in the AFM phase photographs (Fig. 7b and d) and TEM pictures (Fig. 7e and f), the two films both possess an interpenetrating network with finely changed nano-phase separation. Compared to the i-mO-4F blend, the i-pO-4F film shows an indistinguishable difference, implying the analogous nano-phase separation in their films, which is one of the reasons for the corresponding charge mobilities and photovoltaic performances of these two acceptor-based devices. Compared with the i-mO-4Cl blend, obviously improved nano-phase separation is observed in the i-pO-4Cl film, which results in the higher JSC, FF, and PCE.

The tendency in the photovoltaic performances of the i-IEICO-4F- (13.17%), i-mO-4F- (14.02%), and i-pO-4F (13.47%)-based devices under the same conditions are in accordance with that of the reported alkoxy-phenyl-modified ITIC derivatives,39 suggesting the effectiveness of para-hexyloxy-phenyl and meta-hexyloxy-phenyl modification vs. the para-hexyl-phenyl side-chain of NFAs to improve the JSC and FF of PSCs. Moreover, the PCE values of the i-mO-4F- and i-pO-4F-based devices are among the highest values to date for PBDB-T-based PSCs,46–57 which indicates that the combination of alkoxy-phenyl side-chain modification and the non-planar main-chain strategy can offer helpful guidance for the molecular design and structural optimization of high-efficiency NFA materials.
Conclusions
In summary, we designed and prepared two new meta-alkoxy-phenyl and two new para-alkoxy-phenyl-modified main-chain-twisted NFAs for polymer solar cells. Compared to the chlorinated NFAs i-mO-4Cl and i-pO-4Cl, the fluorinated molecules i-mO-4F and i-pO-4F possess slightly elevated LUMO levels and better morphology with PBDB-T in the active layers. Thus, as a result of these synergetic characteristics, the best devices of the PBDB-T:i-mO-4F and PBDB-T:i-pO-4F blends achieved an impressive PCE of 14.02% and 13.47%, respectively, which are higher than that of the i-mO-4Cl-based device (7.41%) and the i-pO-4Cl-based device (10.98%). This work, on the one hand, elaborates the promoted photovoltaic performances by alkoxy-phenyl-modified twisted non-fullerene acceptors, and on the other hand, illustrates the morphology difference of the fluorinated and the chlorinated twisted acceptors to significantly influence the performances in PSCs.
