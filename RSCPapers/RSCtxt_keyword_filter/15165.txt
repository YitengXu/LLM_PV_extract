    , Accepted 4th March 2021First published on 12th March 2021AbstractMetal halide perovskites (MHPs) have shown unparalleled potential for optoelectronic applications. In particular, the quasi one-dimensional perovskite structures have attracted great attention due to their unique optoelectronic properties which can open up new possibilities for this exciting materials system. However, it is challenging to acquire one-dimensional cubic-phase MHPs in high yield due to their isotropic crystallization nature and instability towards conventional fabrication processes. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of synthesizing single-crystalline perovskite microwires from an intrinsic 1D structured lattice framework which defines the size and shape of the resulting microwires. By incorporating the appropriate monovalent ions into the lattice of self-assembled PbBr2 microwires, single-crystal CH3NH3PbBr3 microwires are successfully synthesized. The excellent crystal quality of the microwires has led to a high carrier mobility of 36 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a long charge carrier lifetime of ∼100 ns. As a preliminary demonstration of their optoelectronics functionality, single CH3NH3PbBr3 microwire-based photodetectors are fabricated and the devices exhibit a fast response time (a rise time of 113 μs and a decay time of 295 μs), stable light switching behavior, high sensitivity, and good spatial resolution. The method described here proposes a novel and facile strategy for synthesizing single-crystal perovskite microwires with high yield and repeatability, showing the great promise of MHPs in micro-optoelectronic applications.
Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskites (HOIPs) have attracted much attention for high performance optoelectronic applications due to their remarkable advantages, such as high quantum yield, high light absorption coefficient, long charge carrier diffusion length, and tunable direct bandgap.1–7 Notably, the absorption coefficient of the perovskite in the visible wavelength range is much larger than that of most existing optoelectronic materials, resulting in a much higher photosensitivity which can be useful for photovoltaics and photodetection.8 Indeed, remarkable progress has been achieved in the development of hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs), with their power conversion efficiency (PCE) soaring from 3.8%9 to 25.2%10 over the past ten years. In addition to PSCs, HOIPs have also displayed great potential in many other optoelectronic fields such as in field effect transistors (FETs),11,12 light-emitting diodes (LEDs)13,14 and photodetectors.15,16 Structural and morphological engineering has been the key to tailoring the optical and electrical properties of HOIPs so that they can fulfill the specific requirements of different applications.17 In particular, stripe-like quasi-1D and 1D structures are favorable for realizing microlasers18,19 and waveguides20,21 due to their special geometry which allows efficient optical confinement. Moreover, in contrast to polycrystalline perovskite thin films, 1D structures usually have a high crystallinity which promises a longer lifetime of the photogenerated carriers, better charge separation and conductivity.22,23 As such, great emphasis has been placed on the development of perovskite nano- and micro-wires, which show great potential in micro-optoelectronic applications.
Despite the many wonderful properties and potential applications, the synthesis of HOIP nano- and micro-wires remains challenging. The isotropic pseudo-cubic lattice of many perovskite materials intrinsically disfavors the growth of HOIP crystals naturally into anisotropic structures with high yield and controllability such that other structures like nanosheets and bulk crystals will also appear at the same growth.24 And the instability of perovskite towards solvents commonly used in conventional semiconductor fabrication processes makes it hard to realize HOIP microwires via top-down approaches.25 Template assisted anti-solvent growth has therefore been developed to realize 1D perovskite structures,18,26,27 and has led to many excellent results in nanowire lasers and micro-/nano-wire array photodetectors. The use of templates, however, can undesirably introduce defects and impurities, while the well-designed templates definitely increases the complexity of the process.28,29 Moreover, it has been difficult to transfer these nano/microwires, which are grown and fixed within confined regions, to other substrates for subsequent device fabrication.30 In addition, these bottom-up growths are generally very sensitive to the crystal growth conditions, such as temperature, and precursor concentration disturbance. Precise control of these process parameters can be challenging and can lead to uncertainties in process repeatability. Hence, it is highly desirable to develop a novel growth strategy to obtain high quality transferable perovskite microwires with high yield and repeatability.
In this study, we demonstrate a facile method to realize size-controllable halide perovskite single-crystal microwires by synergizing the natural anisotropic growth of PbBr2 single-crystals with the efficient incorporation of monovalent ions into the predefined lattices. Specifically, we synthesize single crystal PbBr2 microwires as the initial framework, in a way which is distinctively different from the previous two-step methods in which mixed polycrystalline microstructures (including wires, plates, etc.) have been employed for conversion into perovskite.31,32 Owing to its anisotropic orthorhombic crystal structure, PbBr2 can be grown naturally into wires with lengths adjustable from the microscale to the centimeter scale via a spontaneous self-assembled process which shows high yield and repeatability. The PbBr2 single crystals, having the desired size and shape, then act as a lattice framework for the formation of perovskite microwires by allowing the appropriate monovalent ions (e.g. CH3NH3+ (MA+) ions) to diffuse into the lattice, thus converting the binary compound into perovskite microwires. In contrast to the template-assisted growth, our synthesis method does not require the use of any mask which can introduce impurities or defects into the perovskite lattice. It is worth noting that the freestanding PbBr2 microwires have been obtained in solution and can be easily transferred to various substrates for device fabrication.33 CH3NH3PbBr3 microwires with high crystallinity and purity can therefore be realized with high yield and repeatability using the simple solution-based processes. Indeed, extensive material characterization reveals that the microwires are single-crystalline and exhibit a long carrier lifetime, which is a good indication of a low defect density. Single-microwire photodetectors were fabricated as a prototype to showcase the potential of these microwires for optoelectronic applications. Thanks to the high carrier mobility of ∼36 cm2 V−1 s−1, the photodetector shows a fast response with a short decay time of 295 μs. Moreover, the low defect density promises a device with a low noise current, which is crucial for the detection of weak light. The excellent responsivity and compact size render the single-microwire photodetector useful for the high-resolution spatial profiling of light intensity variations. As a preliminary demonstration, we built a setup for micro-feature detection based on the microwire detector and successfully resolved a 1 mm diameter thread. Notably, the lattice-framework synthesis process can also yield other single crystalline metal halide perovskites including CsPbBr3 and CH(NH2)2PbBr3 (FAPbBr3) microwires. This novel strategy provides a flexible synthesis method for producing crystallization-kinetics-independent single-crystals, which may help to extend the application scope of halide perovskite materials and would be useful for engineering the shape of single-crystals in materials with intrinsic crystalline limitations.
Results and discussion
The synthesis of single-crystalline CH3NH3PbBr3 microwires started with the fabrication of lead bromide (PbBr2) microwires using a template-free antisolvent process, followed by a subsequent ion incorporation process to convert PbBr2 into perovskite while maintaining the microwire architecture, as illustrated in Fig. 1a. The specific synthesis method is described in detail in the Experimental section. In brief, 1 mL of PbBr2 in DMF (50 mg mL−1) was added to a 5 mL vial, which was placed in a sealed antisolvent atmosphere (10 mL isopropanol in a 50 mL vial) at room temperature for 120 hours. The diffusion of antisolvent vapor into the small vial continuously lowered the solubility of PbBr2 in DMF. Upon supersaturation, the PbBr2 crystal seeds spontaneously nucleated and gradually evolved into self-assembled microwires. Interestingly, the dimensions of the PbBr2 microwires depend strongly on the density of nucleation seeds, which can be controlled by the stirring rate of the supersaturated solution. Without stirring, PbBr2 can grow into milliwires with diameters ranging from about 10 to 60 μm and lengths ranging from tens of microns to several centimeters (see Fig. S2, ESI†). When magnetic stirring was applied, the wire diameter and length drop significantly to less than 10 μm and 100 μm, respectively. The shrinkage in the dimensions is accompanied by a sharp increase in the wire density. Such observations can be attributed to the inhibition of the rapid crystallization on the PbBr2 crystal seeds by stirring, thus allowing more wires with smaller dimensions to form during the growth process (see the schematic illustration in Fig. S1 for more details, ESI†). The obtained PbBr2 microwires were then converted into CH3NH3PbBr3 microwires by dipping them into a CH3NH3Br3/isopropanol solution for 24 hours (see Fig. 1a for details), with the microwire dimensions being essentially unchanged during the conversion process. Notably, the PbBr2 lattice framework can also be converted into other perovskites such as CsPbBr3 and FAPbBr3 by immersing the binary compound in the corresponding solution for ion diffusion (see Fig. S2 and S4 for more details, ESI†). Thus, using the two-step method outlined here, we can obtain CH3NH3PbBr3 microwires with lengths tailorable from tens of microns to millimeters.

(b) Schematic demonstration of converting the PbBr2 crystal into the CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite structure by immersing the microwires into CH3NH3Br/isopropanol solution. 
To understand how the conversion occurs, it is crucial to examine the crystal structures of PbBr2 and CH3NH3PbBr3. In both cases, each Pb2+ ion coordinates with six Br− ions to form an octahedral (PbBr64−) unit. During the solution supersaturated growth, the octahedral units are linked together via a combination of edge-connections and corner-connections,34 as shown in Fig. 1b. The asymmetry in the crystal lattice gives rise to the anisotropic growth of PbBr2 into a wire architecture. For cubic CH3NH3PbBr3, the octahedral units are corner-connected in all three directions, with the CH3NH3+ ions occupying the vertexes of the cubic lattice, thus forming a 3-dimensional framework. Hence, when dipping the PbBr2 microwires into the CH3NH3Br/isopropanol solution, the PbBr64− octahedrons reconfigure into the perovskite framework in which the units all are corner-connected. At the same time, CH3NH3+ and Br− ions diffuse into the framework to complete the perovskite lattice structure, which is crucial for the luminescence properties of the crystal. According to theoretical calculations, the excitation and recombination processes occur within the octahedrons in which the Br 4p and Pb 6p orbitals contribute to the valence and conduction band edges, respectively.35 A deficiency in Br would result in Br vacancy (VBr) type defects, which form energy levels in the band gap and affect the recombination kinetics of the carriers.36 Hence, it is crucial to use excess CH3NH3Br solution to provide enough CH3NH3+ and Br− ions in the conversion process to obtain perovskite microwires with intact crystal structures for fewer defect states and improved optoelectronic characteristics.
As a pioneer PbBr64−-octahedron framework for perovskite, the crystal quality of the PbBr2 microwires directly determines the optoelectronic properties of the converted perovskite microwires. Thus, it is of importance to realize high crystal quality PbBr2 microwires. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of an ensemble of as-grown randomly scattered small PbBr2 microwires is shown in Fig. 2a. Notably, other types of structures like micro-plates and randomly-shaped crystals are completely absent, revealing the excellent high yield of micro-wire structures. The microwires exhibit satisfactorily uniform diameters in the range of a few micrometers and show a well-defined square-shaped cross-section, as shown in the inset. Fig. 2b displays a large single PbBr2 microwire with a diameter of about 30 μm. The extremely smooth surface is the first indication of its excellent crystal quality. Fig. 2c–e shows various typical single microwires obtained from the same run, which illustrate the growth uniformity of the structure with a preferred orientation along the longitudinal direction. It is worth noting that the black dots on the substrate show the residual solvent for dispersing the microwires. In addition, with a long enough growth time, the length of the PbBr2 microwires can increase up to a centimeter, as shown in Fig. 2f. The large span in the dimensions of the PbBr2 microwires indicates the flexibility of dimension control for the subsequent conversion into perovskite microwires. Using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), elemental mapping images were collected from the square dotted area of a typical PbBr2 microwire as shown in Fig. 2g. The maps reveal that Pb and Br elements are evenly distributed over the entire area. In addition, the EDS spectrum yields an average Br/Pb ratio of 2.09, which is close to the stoichiometric ratio of PbBr2. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on single PbBr2 microwires to further evaluate the crystal quality of the self-assembled structures. As shown in Fig. 2h, the characteristic diffraction peaks obtained from a single PbBr2 microwire are sharp and almost equidistant, suggesting that the micro-structures are single-crystalline. Moreover, the XRD peaks can be attributed to diffraction from the (001) planes of the orthorhombic phase lead bromide crystal, similar to other reported works on lead iodide single-crystals.37–39 Furthermore, the specific value of the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the 002 peak (excited by the Kα1 line) is as narrow as 0.038°, which shows the high crystal quality of PbBr2. These exciting results prove that the as-assembled PbBr2 microwires are single-crystals with a high crystalline quality, and these provide a perfect framework for the subsequent perovskite conversion.

(g) Pb and Br elemental mapping images for the PbBr2 microwire. (h) Corresponding XRD patterns of the single PbBr2 microwire from (f). 
The PbBr2 microwires were then transformed into CH3NH3PbBr3 microwires by introducing CH3NH3+ and Br− ions into the PbBr64− octahedron framework. Specifically, we immersed the PbBr2 microwires into a CH3NH3Br/isopropanol solution. IPA was selected as the solvent because it can ionize CH3NH3Br without destroying the PbBr2 crystalline structure. The converted CH3NH3PbBr3 microwires exhibit a similar appearance to the starting PbBr2 microwires (Fig. 3a and b). The lengths of these perovskite microwires can vary from 2 μm (inset of Fig. 3a) to 60 μm (Fig. 3b), which are within a similar range as the lengths of the PbBr2 wires. The transformed CH3NH3PbBr3 microwire displays an extremely smooth surface (the inset of Fig. 3b), which gives an initial indication of the excellent crystal quality of the obtained microwires. The optical images in Fig. S2 (ESI†) display the large-sized microwires before and after conversion. The dramatic color change from white in PbBr2 to orange red in the CH3NH3PbBr3 microwires can clearly be observed, indicating the completeness of the lattice transformation. Moreover, the high density of the microwires in Fig. S2 (ESI†) attests to the very high yield of this novel synthesis process. To confirm whether or not the CH3NH3+ and Br− ions have been effectively implanted into the PbBr2 microwires, EDS elemental mapping images were collected from the microwire cross section. As seen in Fig. S3(c) (ESI†), C, Pb and Br are found to be evenly distributed over the entire area of interest. Furthermore, the quantitative elemental analysis yields an average Br/Pb ratio of 2.9, which is close to the stoichiometric ratio of the perovskite molecular formula. A series of XRD spectra taken at different dipping times were collected from a 60 μm-diameter single microwire to exhibit the change in lattice structure during the conversion process (see Fig. S5, ESI†). Once the PbBr2 microwire had been immersed in the CH3NH3Br/IPA solution, the higher order diffraction peaks of PbBr2 disappeared immediately, and the 001 and 002 peaks of CH3NH3PbBr3 began to emerge. As the immersion time is increased, the diffraction peaks of CH3NH3PbBr3 gradually grow stronger and dominate. At a long enough dipping time (>30 minutes), all of the PbBr2 peaks had vanished, which implies that PbBr2 had been completely converted into CH3NH3PbBr3. The observations here clearly indicate the effective introduction of CH3NH3+ and Br− ions into the octahedron framework using this facile solution-based method, leading to the complete conversion of PbBr2 into CH3NH3PbBr3.

(e) HRTEM image of CH3NH3PbBr3 microwires converted from PbBr2 microwires. 
To further investigate the crystal quality of the obtained CH3NH3PbBr3 microwires, we compare the XRD patterns obtained from a single microwire as well as a CH3NH3PbBr3 single-crystal (detailed synthesis methods are described in the Experiment Section). As shown in Fig. 3c, the XRD peaks of the perovskite microwire are very consistent in position with those of the single-crystal, and can be perfectly indexed to the (001), (002) and (003) planes of the typical cubic-phase CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite crystal structure.40 More importantly, the FWHM values of the 001 and 002 peaks in our microwires are comparable with those in the single-crystal (Table S1, ESI†). These observations suggest that our microwires are actually single-crystalline. To further confirm this deduction, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) was applied. In this technique, the incident electron beam interacts with the surface of the material and generates an electron backscatter diagram, i.e. the Kikuchi patterns, by incoherent wide-angle electron scattering from the sample. By scanning the electron beam over a large area on the CH3NH3PbBr3 microwire, we can study the crystalline coherency by observing the change in the Kikuchi patterns during the scan. Interestingly, the Kikuchi patterns (see Fig. 3d) are very clear and stable at different positions on the microwire, revealing the high crystal quality and long-range crystal lattice orientation consistency of the CH3NH3PbBr3 microwire. This is further confirmed by a dynamic video in the ESI,† which shows that the Kikuchi pattern remains completely unchanged over an area of about 1125 μm2. In this video, the acquisition time and accumulation of each pixel was set at 0.48 μs and 20 respectively, and 30 frames were acquired per second. Furthermore, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was performed (Fig. 3e) to investigate the crystalline quality of the microwires. One can observe clear lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.292 nm, which corresponds to the (002) planes of the cubic CH3NH3PbBr3 phase41 These results clearly demonstrate that the transformed CH3NH3PbBr3 microwires are single-crystalline, which has a significant impact on their optoelectronic properties.
To demonstrate the superior optoelectronic properties of our single-crystal CH3NH3PbBr3 microwires, steady-state absorption, photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) were implemented (Fig. 4). It can clearly be observed that the single CH3NH3PbBr3 microwire emits bright green light under a 473 nm excitation (inset in Fig. 4a). The PL peak and absorption edge locate at ∼534 nm and ∼543 nm respectively (Fig. 4a), indicating again the successful conversion of the CH3NH3PbBr3 microwire.42 As shown in the fitting curves in Fig. 4a, the absorption spectrum shows a prominent band at about 522 nm and a broad absorption component, which could be respectively attributed to the excitonic absorption and continuum band absorption.43 Moreover, we observed Fabry–Perot cavity like emission in the microwire in which light propagates along the microwire's longitudinal direction and bright green light is emitted in two ends. Such an emission pattern indicates the excellent cavity confinement of the well-faceted CH3NH3PbBr3 microwires for potential applications in waveguide and even lasing action. In addition, the longer wavelength of the PL peak than the absorption edge can be attributed to the radiative recombination of the exciton. To estimate the carrier lifetimes, TRPL measurement was performed for investigating the carrier dynamics of an individual CH3NH3PbBr3 microwire (Fig. 4b). The black circles represent the measured data for the PL decay, which were fitted using a bi-exponential profile (red line). The fitting curve shows a fast and a slow time component of τ1 ≈ 5.9 ns and τ2 ≈ 98.8 ns, respectively. The two different charge carrier lifetimes are associated with surface and bulk recombination, as in prior reports.44 As a comparison, the carrier lifetime of the single-crystal synthesized via the one-step solution precipitation method was also performed (Fig. S6, ESI†) and the fast and slow time components were 3.7 ns and 97.4 ns, respectively. The carrier lifetimes of the CH3NH3PbBr3 microwires are comparable with those of the CH3NH3PbBr3 single-crystal, which indirectly indicates once again that our microwires are single-crystalline. The above crystal structure and material characterizations demonstrate the excellent optical properties of the perovskite microwires, which contribute to the realization of high performance optoelectronic devices.

To demonstrate the potential of the single-crystal microwires for optoelectronic applications, metal–semiconductor–metal (MSM) photodetectors were fabricated based on individual CH3NH3PbBr3 microwires and the schematic of the device is shown in Fig. 5a. Gold electrodes of around 300 nm thickness were evaporated on the two ends of the single microwire. With the microwire diameter being 40 μm and the space between the two electrodes being about 100 μm (shown in the Fig. S8, ESI†), the active area for light detection is estimated to be about 4000 μm2. The current–voltage (I–V) curves of the photodetector measured in the dark and under the illumination of a 450 nm laser with different intensities are all linear, indicating that the contacts are ohmic and that the device works as a photoconductive detector (Fig. 5b). In particular, the photocurrent increases linearly from 0.1 nA to 374.9 nA when the irradiation power is increased from 0.8 nW to 19.5 μW, as shown in the inset of Fig. 5b. This linear dependence gives rise to a linear dynamic range (LDR) of at least 88 dB, where the details of the calculations can be found in the ESI.† Such a respectably wide LDR reveals that our microwire photodetectors can be useful for practical optical communication and imaging applications.

(b) I–V curves of the device measured at room temperature under dark and illumination with 450 nm light of different power levels; the inset shows the linear dynamic range of the photodetector under 5 V. (c) Photocurrent variation under continuous switching between dark and bright (irradiation power = 19.5 μW) conditions. (d) Transient response of the device. The rise and fall times are well below 300 μs. (e) Responsivity of the photodetector under different bias voltages. (f) The noise current of the photodetector measured at a bias voltage of 5 V. At low frequencies, the noise current is at the 0.1 pA level, attesting to the low defect density of the microwire. 
In addition to the capability of detecting light with a wide range of intensities, the temporal response is also an important indicator of the performance of a photodetector. Fig. 5c displays the response of the photocurrent under alternating optical switching at a frequency of 0.5 Hz. The device exhibits a high on/off ratio of ∼8.8 × 103 when biased at 5 V, under an illumination power of 19.5 μW. Moreover, the dynamic photo-response is very stable under continuous optical switching without any observable hysteresis or degradation in the on/off ratio. When the bias voltage decreases, the same stable switching behavior is observed while the photocurrent drops accordingly (see Fig. S8, ESI†). Such a repeatable smooth switching can be attributed to the very low density of trap states inside the single-crystal and at the MS-interface. Fig. 5d illustrates the temporal responses of the photodetector switching between on and off states, using a 450 nm laser modulated at 20 Hz. The rise and fall times are measured to be 113 μs and 295 μs, respectively, which compare favorably with the transition times of other similar microwire photodetectors.45,46 The fast response can be attributed to the high carrier mobility of 36 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is close to that of the bulk single-crystal6 (see Fig. S7 for details, ESI†). The fast and stable switching behavior observed renders our microwire photodetector potentially useful for high-speed light detection, which is crucial for modern optical communications.
To evaluate the capability of the microwire photodetector for weak light detection, responsivity (R) curves were measured under different biasing voltages, as shown in Fig. 5e. Details of the measurement can be found in the ESI.† In general, the three curves exhibit similar dependences on the wavelength of the incident light, with the responsivity increasing with the biasing voltage. The device shows a decent light response from 300 nm to more than 550 nm, covering the near-UV and most of the visible light regions. In particular, under a 5 V bias, the responsivity reaches a maximum value of 0.1 A W−1 at 530 nm and drops quickly at longer wavelengths. Such a rapid decay is consistent with the absorption spectrum in Fig. 4a, which reveals that the absorption edge (and thus the bandgap) of single-crystal MAPbBr3 is located at around 540 nm. Noise is the basic limitation for the detection of weak light in photodetectors. As seen in Fig. 5f, the noise current is as low as 3.8 × 10−13 A Hz−1/2 at 70 Hz under a bias of 5 V and is almost constant over the frequency range of 10–103 Hz. We note that such a low noise current in the low frequency region compares favorably with some of the best perovskite-based photodetectors reported in the literature.47,48 In the low frequency range, the noise current is essentially dominated by the flicker noise, which originates from the electronic transitions involving trap/defect states. The low noise current observed in the low-frequency region indicates that the defect density in our perovskite microwires is extremely low, which once again attests to the excellent crystal quality of the single-crystal micro-structure. Based on the noise current and the responsivity, the specific detectivity (D*) is estimated according to the following equations.  where A is the active area, B is the bandwidth, in is the noise current and the NEP is the noise equivalent power. As shown in Fig. S9 in the ESI,†D* reaches a maximum value of 1.4 × 109 cm Hz1/2 W−1 at 530 nm, which is a reasonably good number for a single microwire photodetector with a lateral device architecture and a relatively small light detection area. The exciting results here fully demonstrate that our single-crystal perovskite microwires, possessing a very low defect density, can be useful for photodetection and other optoelectronic applications that require a fast response, high optical sensitivity and low background noise.
In addition to the low noise current being useful for the detection of weak light, the small size of the microwire enables its application potential in pixel enhancement for imaging and the detection of small objects. As a proof of concept, we established a micro-object detection system (MODS) based on our single microwire photodetector and achieved a spatial resolution of around 1 mm in one dimension. Fig. 6a shows the schematic diagram of the MODS, which consists of a white point light source with adjustable optical power, a quartz glass plate sample holder (6 cm below the light source), and a single crystal microwire detector placed on top of a one-dimensional sliding stage. During the measurement, the microwire detector moved at a speed of 50 mm min−1 along the horizontal direction under the transparent sample holder and the spacing between them is about 1 mm. Owing to the miniature size of the microwire, our photodetector is capable of detecting the local light intensity variation with sub-millimeter precision over the entire scanning range in space. The output current of the photodetector was recorded continuously using a computer-controlled Keithley 2601 with the device biased at +15 V. Fig. S10(d and e) (ESI†) shows the one-dimensional photocurrent (and thus light intensity) profiles of the point light source operating at different power levels, over a scanning range of 100 mm. All profiles assume a Gaussian distribution but with some deviations in the central region, possibly due to the focusing optics present in the light source. Such a capability of measuring the spatial light intensity profiles with high precision is useful for micro-feature detection. To demonstrate such potential, we placed on the sample holder a 1 mm opaque fine thread whose orientation is perpendicular to the motion of the microwire photodetector (see the illustration in Fig. 6a). Fig. 6b–d, displays the photocurrent profiles in the presence of the fine thread under different light intensities. The colored stripes in the background of the line profiles are a grayscale representation of the photocurrent detected at that particular location. When the light intensity exceeds 8 mW cm−2, an obvious dip can be observed at around 30 mm (i.e. when the microwire photodetector is 30 mm away from the starting point), indicating the position at which the fine thread partially blocks the light. From the width of the dip, we can calculate the diameter of the object to be in the range of 0.8–1.4 mm, which is within an acceptable error range of its actual size. Moreover, we have established a visible light communication system with the perovskite microwire and obtained a remarkably stable and accurate transmission and reception of signals between a blue light-emitting diode and the microwire photodetector (see Fig. S11 for detailed information, ESI†). These demonstrations clearly reveal that these compact single-crystalline microwires with excellent optoelectronic properties can potentially be integrated into a full system for a wide range of practical applications in imaging, inspection and other fields.

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a novel strategy to produce single-crystal halide perovskite microwires via the efficient incorporation of organic monovalent ions into the PbBr2 lattice framework. Owing to the anisotropic crystal lattice, PbBr2 could be grown spontaneously into self-assembled microwires with lengths ranging from microns to centimeters at room temperature using an optimized anti-solvent method. By incorporating the organic monovalent ions into the PbBr2 lattice framework, we have successfully demonstrated the synthesis of single-crystal organic–inorganic hybrid CH3NH3PbBr3 microwires. In particular, the long carrier lifetime of over 100 ns and high carrier mobility of ∼36 cm2 V−1 s−1 clearly indicate the low density of defects in the microwire. Single-microwire photodetectors were fabricated to showcase their potential for optoelectronic applications. High photoresponsivity, a fast response time (<295 μs) and an ultra low noise current render the microwire detector useful for weak light detection at high speed, which is crucial for modern optical communications. In addition, the compact size of the single-wire detector enables light intensity profiling with high spatial resolution. In particular, we achieved a spatial resolution of 1 mm, using a micro-object detection system based on the single-wire detector. The exciting results in this work not only provide a novel route for acquiring high quality perovskite microwires which can be applied in micro optoelectronic devices, but also put forward a new growth mechanism that is not affected by the original crystal phase of perovskite, thus breaking the limit for perovskite, and which may lead to variable structures that can satisfy different optoelectronic demands.
Experimental section
Chemicals
Lead bromide (PbBr2, 99.99%), methylamine bromide (CH3NH3Br, 99.5%) and formamidinium bromide (CH(NH2)2Br, 99.5%) were purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp. Cesium bromide (CsBr, 99.9%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. N,N-Dimethylmethanamide (DMF, 99.5%), and isopropyl alcohol (IPA, 99.7%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. N-Hexane (99.0%) was purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. Dichloromethane (CH2Cl2, 99.9%) was purchased from Acros Organics. All chemicals were used without any further purification.
Preparation of PbBr2 microwires
PbBr2 microwires were synthesized using the improved antisolvent method. 50 mg pure PbBr2 powder was completely dissolved in 1 mL DMF solution with 1 hour of thermal heating at 90 °C. The above solution was then added into a 5 mL vial, which was placed in a sealed antisolvent atmosphere (10 mL IPA in a 50 mL vial) at room temperature. The PbBr2 microwires were crystallized within a period of 3 days. The obtained PbBr2 microwires were rinsed with 3 mL N-hexane to remove the mixture solvent of IPA and DMF in the small vial. The obtained PbBr2 microwires had a diameter of about 10–60 μm and were dried in a nitrogen atmosphere. To obtain small diameter (1–10 μm) PbBr2 microwires, a magneton was added to the small vial and the antisolvent setup was placed on a magnetic stirrer at a rotation rate of 180 rpm. The other experimental conditions were the same as above and the small dimension PbBr2 microwires were re-dispersed in 5 mL N-hexane after rinsing with N-hexane.
Synthesis of perovskite microwires
The CH3NH3Br, CH(NH2)2Br and CsBr powder was completely dissolved in isopropanol solution with 1 hour of thermal heating at 90 °C to obtain concentrations of 20 mg mL−1, 20 mg mL−1 and 5 mg mL−1, respectively. Then the PbBr2 microwires in N-hexane were dispersed onto a glass substrate by spin coating with a rotating speed of 1000 rpm min−1 for 30 s before being immersed in the above solutions overnight. In addition, a longer soaking time will result in a more complete conversion. All conversion processes were performed thoroughly under a nitrogen atmosphere and all the perovskite microwires samples were rinsed in IPA first and then the residual solvent removed with N-hexane before use.
Synthesis of CH3NH3PbBr3 single-crystal
The CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite single-crystals were synthesized using a common one-step antisolvent solution saturation crystallization method. In short, 73.4 mg PbBr2 and 22.4 mg CH3NH3Br were completely dissolved in 1 mL DMF to form a CH3NH3Br·PbBr2 solution (0.2 M). Then 10 μL of the prepared solution was added dropwise onto a 1.5 × 1.5 cm glass substrate, which was placed in a sealed antisolvent atmosphere (10 mL dichloromethane in a 50 mL vial) at room temperature. It is worth noting that the glass substrate is above the liquid surface. After 24 hours, the antisolvent vapor diffused into the CH3NH3Br·PbBr2 droplet and CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite single-crystals were crystallized on the substrate.
Device fabrication
A single CH3NH3PbBr3 microwire was picked out and placed on a 1 × 1 cm2 silicon oxide substrate. Gold electrodes were evaporated with a hard mask placed on the surface of the microwire in the vacuum evaporation machines. The hard mask was made with a laboratory laser marking machine and the effective occlusion area was 2 × 0.1 mm2. With a relatively slow evaporation rate (∼0.3 Å s−1) of gold, the thickness of the final vapor deposition on the surface of the microwire is about 300 nm. Finally, the active area of the photodetector was about 4000 μm2 as defined by the area of the microwire not covered by the electrodes.
Material characterizations
The optical images of all microwires were captured using a Zeiss AxioCam ICc 5 microscope. The steady-PL of the halide perovskite samples was monitored using a Confocal Laser Raman Spectrometer (LabRAM HR Evolution, HORIBA, Japan) with a 473 nm excitation laser. The absorption spectrum of the as-prepared samples was measured using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2600, Shimadzu, Japan). The XRD measurements were carried out with a Rigaku Smart Lab 9kW system rotating anode X-ray source with Cu (λ ≈ 1.54 Å) coupling with the high-quality semiconductor detector, and a step size of 0.002 degree. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a Zeiss Sigma with a Schottky Field Emission source operating at 2 kV. Energy-disperse X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) data were collected from the samples using the same SEM embedded EDX detector at an operating voltage of 20 kV. The Kikuchi lines were obtained using the technique of Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) on a Zeiss Crossbeam 540 Gemini 2 operating at a 10 kV accelerating voltage and a 3 nA acquisition current. The fluorescence lifetime decay was recorded by Time Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) using an Edinburgh FS5 fluorescence spectrophotometer with a picosecond laser of 405 nm at room temperature. The HRTEM measurements were carried out on a Talos F200X, FEI operating at 200 kV. The I–V curves and optical switching I–t measurements were performed using a semiconductor device analyzer (KEYSIGHT B1500A) equipped with a SEMISHARE probe station. The response speed was measured with a Tektronix MDO4054C Mixed Domain Oscilloscope cooperated with a low-noise current preamplifier SR570 (Stanford Research Systems) and the optical switch of the laser source was controlled using a RIGOL DG4602 Function/Arbitrary Waveform Generator. The responsivity of the device with different monochromatic light wavelengths was obtained from a photodetection spectral response calibration system (Zolix Instruments). The noise current curves of the device were obtained using the ProPlus 9812D wafer-level 1/f noise characterization system.
