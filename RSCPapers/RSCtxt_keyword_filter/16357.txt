    , Accepted 11th June 2018First published on 11th June 2018AbstractWe studied perovskite photovoltaic devices with intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy. Two coexisting relaxation times are found in accordance with the results of previous impedance spectroscopy (IS) measurements. The slower time constant is independent of the light power while the faster one is inversely proportional to the light power. We employed the surface polarization picture used in the IS analysis augmented by a plausible assumption that the surface polarization is proportional to the light intensity to explain the inverse power dependence of the fast time constant. Because the surface polarization results from the surface accumulated charges, its lateral (parallel to the electrode) distribution and dynamics should be known. We present evidence that the surface accumulated charges indeed form a two-dimensional layer, and have a finite binding energy and a diffusion length.
Introduction
Perovskite-based solar cells (PSCs) have been intensively studied recently because of their high efficiency and easy fabrication. The efficiency has exceeded 20%.1–3 In order to further improve the device performance and understand the degradation mechanism, it is essential to identify the power loss routes, especially the charge carrier recombination processes. The small perturbation methods (e.g., the transient photovoltage (TPV) technique, intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS), impedance spectroscopy (IS), etc.) are widely used tools in the research of (photo)carrier relaxation.
Compared to the TPV method that is used to measure the overall time-domain decay rate of the photovoltage,4–8 one can easily separate and distinguish the individual relaxation routes (when multiple routs coexist) in the frequency domain with the IS and IMVS techniques. The IMVS experiment and the TPV experiment are equivalent rather than complementary (see the ESI† for a brief discussion). IMVS is regarded to be complementary to IS9–13 and the results are very similar.10 In this work, we employed IMVS because it allows the facile modulation of the spot size or lateral positioning to create lateral inhomogeneity, which is the essential technical aspect in this work.
According to the recent publications using IS, there are at least two coexisting relaxation processes.10,14–17 It is reported that the decay rate of the slower relaxation process (τslow, ∼0.1–1 s) is roughly independent of the light power while that of the faster process (τfast, ∼10−5–10−3 s) is inversely proportional to the light power. Up to now, the interpretation for these features is still under study. The power dependence of τfast is explained by Pockett et al. using the diode J–V equation.9,10 However we think that their explanation is insufficient because (1) in organic solar cells (OSCs), although the diode J–V equation is applicable, the power dependence is τfast ∝ P0−0.518–21 which is different from what we observe in PSCs (τfast ∝ P0−1) and (2) a microscopic picture is still in need. For the slower feature, there are two pictures in general.22 The first picture assigns it to the migration of ions or defects,10,17,22–25 while the second picture assigns it to the interface recombination.26,27 Recently Bisquert's group further developed the interface recombination picture to the ‘surface polarization’ picture.14–16,22,28,29 In their picture, the low frequency feature (capacitance in the equivalent circuit) is determined by the charge accumulation near the light-incident electrode while the faster relaxation process is the recombination between surface carriers and the free carriers inside the perovskite bulk. Indeed both ion movement30–34 and carrier accumulation35 have been experimentally proved, although no evidence has been presented so far that can directly link the mechanism to either the slower IMVS or IS feature. However, in both pictures, at least it is commonly accepted that there are some accumulated charge carriers near the electrodes.22 Moreover, the presence of the accumulated carriers is experimentally proved.35
The topic of this paper is to answer the linear power dependence of the faster feature. We start by evaluating the power dependence of IMVS signals of an ‘inverted’ PSC (a light-incident electrode as the anode), revealing two relaxation processes of different power dependences. Our result is similar to Zarazua's IS result from a ‘regular’ PSC (a light-incident electrode as the cathode),14 indicating that the IMVS and IS results, either from regular or inverted PSCs, are comparable. We assume that the faster relaxation is due to the recombination between the free carriers and accumulated carriers.14 This is the sole assumption in this paper, which can explain the results of ensuing experiments. Of course, the origin of the slow process, either ionic or accumulated charge, is a separate issue, which remains an open question. Nevertheless, we take the conceivable effect of the ionic motion into consideration semiquantitatively when appropriate because we include this mechanism as another option.
Experimental
The device under study is indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA)/MAPbI3/PC61BM/aluminum zinc oxide (AZO)/Ag of ca. 0.26 cm2 showing a power conversion efficiency of ∼13%. The device J–V curve is shown in Fig. 1. The fabrication process is similar to our previous papers.36–38 The ITO-coated glass substrates were first pretreated by ultrasonic cleaning and ultraviolet-ozone. The PTAA (0.5 wt% in chlorobenzene) layer was deposited by spin coating at 1000 rpm and subsequent thermal annealing at 100 °C for 5 min. Then the PbI2 solution (400 mg ml−1 in dimethylformamide) was spin coated at 3000 rpm for 90 s prior to spinning the mixture of MAI and MACl at 4000 rpm for 90 s for Cl-mediated interdiffusion.39 To promote crystallization, those as grown MAPbI3 perovskite films were placed inside the Petri disk with MACl powders on a hot plate at 100 °C for MACl treatment.36 Next, the PC61BM (20 mg ml−1 in chlorobenzene) layer was deposited by spin coating at 700 rpm for 60 s before annealing at 100 °C for 20 min while the AZO layer was spin coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 100 °C for 30 min. Finally the Ag layer was thermally deposited onto the active layers under vacuum below 10−4 Pa to complete the device. With respect to stability, the devices (∼5 mm × 5 mm) are encapsulated with UV-curable resins and slide glass.

In the IMVS technique, the device under test is illuminated with intensity modulated light, , (f: frequency, t: time). In this work, the modulation depth (|ΔP|/P0) is controlled to be less than 10%. The time dependent open-circuit voltage, , is monitored and the complex ratio  is calculated as a function of f. In order to easily compare the IMVS signals with the impedance result, previous papers introduced two ways to convert  to Ohm unit (denoted as R hereafter). The first way is converting via where e is the elementary charge and  is the perturbing absorbed photon flux.13,40 The other way is converting via where  is the perturbed photo current (measured separately when the device is placed under DC open circuit voltage and the same modulated light, termed as IMPS in other literature10,13). In this work, we chose to use the first way because we considered a very low power range in which the  is too weak, leading to noisy results. When the total relaxation rate is k, a resonance feature, minimum (negative) point of Im(R) will be found at fmin = k/(2π) and the corresponding relaxation time = 1/(2πfmin).41 This relaxation can be either recombination9,10,14,41–43 or other relaxation processes e.g., ion migration.9,10,15,28,30,34,44,45
The excitation light is from a laser diode operated at 638 nm. Light absorption at this wavelength by the PC61BM layer is negligible according to the reported absorption spectra.46–48 Therefore, photophysics in the PC61BM layer is excluded from the discussion. Experimental details are described in the ESI.†
Results and discussion
Power dependence
The dependence of −Im(R) and Re(R) (the real part of R) on P0 is shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. Two relaxation mechanisms coexist. The slower relaxation rate (blue arrow in Fig. 2a) is nearly constant from ∼9 to ∼14 Hz (18–11 ms) while the faster (purple arrow in Fig. 2a) increases from ∼100 Hz to ∼37 kHz (1.6 ms–4.3 μs) with the light power. The open circuit voltage (Voc) and amplitude at fmin are plotted against light power in Fig. 2c.

(c) Power dependence of Voc and amplitude at fmin. The power dependence of each parameter is clearly different in low and high power regions (indicated by the gray line). (d) Lifetimes of the slower process and faster process. 
When the light power is low (<3 μW), the slower recombination (τslow) is dominant and the Voc increases roughly linearly with power to a noticeable level under low illumination (e.g., 130 mV at 35 nW). Although shunt resistance is considered as an important loss route in the low voltage range,49 in the ESI,† we explained that the shunt resistant is not the origin of the IMVS feature in the low power region.
When the light power is high (>10 μW), a faster process emerges. The lifetimes of the two features are extracted via equivalent circuit fitting and shown in Fig. 2d. The math to obtain the two time constants is described in the ESI.† The faster recombination shows linear power dependence τfast ∝ P0−1.(1)The Voc increases logarithmically with power following the power dependence50–52 eVoc = nkBTln(P0) + const(2)where n is the ideality factor, kB the Boltzmann constant and T the temperature. Our Voc − P0 dependence in high and low power ranges agrees with the previous report.53
Mechanism
As reported in the OSCs, the power dependence of bimolecular recombination should follow τ ∝ P0−0.5.18–21 Therefore bimolecular recombination can be safely excluded to be responsible for the eqn (1) power dependence. In addition, in the ESI† we provide a discussion concluding that any mechanism involving only free electrons/holes cannot yield the required eqn (1) power dependence. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 3 we assign this faster feature to the recombination between free carriers and localized (i.e., not free) carriers. According to the previously reported observation,35 we assume the accumulated carriers to be electrons for a simpler illustration. As mentioned in the introduction, the presence of accumulated carriers near the electrode is commonly accepted22 and experimentally proved.35 Therefore, suggested by the argument of Zarazua et al.,14 we assign the faster process to the recombination between free carriers and the accumulated carriers near the ITO electrode. In this assumption, the dynamics of the free carrier density (n) is described by (3)Here Gn is the quantum yield of n per unit light power, Nacc is the density of the accumulated electrons, and k is a constant recombination coefficient. Solving eqn (3) leads to τfast = 1/(2πkNacc). Therefore according to eqn (1), we arrive at Nacc ∝ P0.(4)Note, eqn (4) suggests that the excess carrier is photogenerated. Suppose the lifetime of the excess carrier is τacc, then under equilibrium, dNacc/dt = GaccP0− (2π/τacc)Nacc = 0(5)where Gacc is the quantum yield of Nacc per unit light power. Consequently we arrive at (6)According to eqn (4) and (6), τacc is constant regardless of the light power. Although the assignment of the slower process is out of the scope of this paper, we would like to remind that the slower IMVS feature lifetime is constant.

For a simpler illustration, we assume the accumulated carriers are electrons here according to a previous report.39 
Dependence on the spot size/position
Because the surface accumulated carriers are localized near the electrode surface, some natural questions arise. For example, how fast they migrate along the electrode surface? What would happen if the photocarriers are injected into the interface non-uniformly? Will they spread out along the lateral electrode surface or pile up locally? In order to understand the dynamics of these accumulated carriers, e.g. the lifetime and the diffusion coefficient, we performed nonconventional lateral transport experiments. The results are consistent with the accumulated charge scenario, which, in turn, is taken as support of our assumption. As far as we are aware, earlier publications only consider the one dimensional carrier distribution in the out-of-plane direction (z-direction in Fig. 4a) using uniform light excitation and there is no report on the carrier dynamics along the lateral direction (x, y-directions in Fig. 4a). In this work, we try to investigate the in-plane carrier relaxation processes using non-uniform light excitation. In order to detect only the positional effect while keeping the total injected photocarriers constant, we used a laser beam with a fixed number of photons per unit time but focused into various spot sizes and positions.

(c) J–V curves obtained from various light spot sizes. (d) The IMVS signal obtained from various excitation positions. The inset of (d) indicates the position of the laser spot relative to the device shape (magenta). The magenta line in (d) is the result obtained when the illumination spot uniformly covers the whole device. The gray lines indicate fmin. A linear y scale is used in this figure to emphasize that the difference is negligible. 
As shown in Fig. 4b, the spot size of the light beam was varied from ϕ 5 mm to ϕ 1.1 mm while keeping the total light power at 1 mW. The spot size variation did not result in any change in IMVS signals. This means that the accumulated charge carriers can eventually spread over an area of ϕ 5 mm as shown by the blue spheres of Fig. 4a. Note that this distance is much larger than the diffusion length of the free carriers in MAPbI3 (<1.2 μm) as shown by the red spheres in Fig. 4a.48 Meanwhile, the light J–V curve (Fig. 4c), which is expected to be dependent on the carrier recombination, also remains unchanged when using different spot sizes. This result again confirms that the photocarrier loss rate is not dominated by the free carrier concentration (the electron–hole density in the illuminated volume). Instead, it is determined by the concentration of the surface accumulated carriers that can effectively spread over an area of a few millimeters. As a supplement, we also show that the IMVS signal is independent of the illumination position of the focused light beam as indicated in Fig. 4d. The experiment result is reproduced three times on three different device batches.
Photocarrier diffusion to an adjacent dark device
From the results shown in Fig. 4, we must conclude that the surface charges can effectively spread over the whole device surface as big as ϕ 5 mm; the illumination spot size/position is irrelevant to the eventual charge distribution. In order to confirm this, a two-device J–V experiment is designed. As schematically shown in Fig. 5a, two devices with independent ITO and Ag electrodes with shared perovskite layers (PTAA/MAPbI3/PC61BM) are fabricated to prove the point. We excited only one device while minimizing light leakage to the other device. The experimental details on how the light leakage is minimized are described in the ESI.† As shown by the red circles in Fig. 5b, when a focused light beam of 2–13 mW is illuminated onto one device (corresponding to short circuit current = 3.2–20 mA cm−2, VOC = ∼0.9–1 V), the current at V = 0 of the other device in the dark is almost zero. A very small “short circuit” current (the non-zero current at V = 0, although the device is in the dark, denoted as Jsc) is detected (10−5 mA cm−2), which may come from either instrumental error or light leakage due to inevitable environmental scattering of the light beam.
 Fig. 5  (a) Illustration of the two isolated devices with a shared perovskite layer. Only a small area of one of the two devices is illuminated and the current in the adjacent dark device is measured. (b) The light power dependence of the J–V curve with the switch open (circles) and closed (solid line). (c) The power dependence of the “short circuit” current (JSC, defined as the nonzero current at V = 0 when the other device is under illumination) and the difference of JSC between two wiring configurations (ΔJSC) of the dark device, which exclude instrumental error. 
Because the electrodes of the two devices are disconnected, the diffusion of the photogenerated surface charges (blue spheres in Fig. 5a) between two devices, if any, will be balanced by their drift backward in the attraction field of the immobile charge carriers of the opposite polarity (gray spheres in Fig. 5a). By contrast, when the ITO electrodes of the two devices are put equipotential by shorting them with a wire, the backward drift current is minimized, leaving the diffusion current towards the dark device only. As a result, the “short circuit” current increased by almost one order to 10−4 mA cm−2 as shown by the red solid curve in Fig. 5b, namely ∼10−3% of the short circuit current of the illuminated device (3.2–20 mA cm−2). It should be pointed out that this current cannot be from the injected current induced by the VOC bias of the illuminated device because the injected current should be positive in contrast to the negative Jsc shown here. Instrumental error (leakage current from the measuring source meter, which should not be dependent on light power) is excluded as the main origin of this 10−4 mA cm−2 current, because the “short circuit” current and the difference of the “short circuit” current between two wiring configurations (ΔJsc) of the dark device increase with the light power to the device (namely, induced by light rather than an instrument) as indicated in Fig. 5c.
We further measured the time-dependence of Jsc (either connected or disconnected) when the laser is switched on/off. As shown in Fig. 6a, when the two ITO electrodes are disconnected (green), the Jsc is low (20 nA cm−2) and its rise and decay profile is about the same as the laser intensity profile (blue), indicating that this Jsc is from the inevitable leakage light to the dark device as we discussed above. However, when the two ITO electrodes are connected (red), the Jsc is high (∼70 nA cm−2) and its rise and fall time lengthened significantly to ∼5 ms, suggesting that this Jsc comes from the migration of the photogenerated carriers from the illuminated device to the dark device which is 3.5 mm away. Clearly, this migration distance is far larger than that of free carriers (<1.2 μm).48 Obviously the falling edge of the red curve in Fig. 6a should be related to the lifetime of the accumulated carriers (τacc). Suppose the surface charges diffuse away from the illumination center along the ITO surface (two dimensional isotropic diffusion), the distribution of the accumulated carriers under steady conditions is then described by, (7)where D is the diffusion constant. Nacc (r) is the distribution of the accumulated electrons, and r is the distance from the center of illumination. Based on the lifetime (the falling edge of the red curve in Fig. 6a) and the spatial distribution (10−3% at 3.5 mm away from the illumination spot), D could be estimated to be ∼0.26 cm2 s−1. The corresponding carrier density distribution as a function of the distance from the illuminated center is shown in Fig. 6b. The current expected in the dark cell is in the right order of magnitude of the observed value (∼10−3% of the short circuit). This D is clearly larger than that of the free electrons (0.011 cm2 s−1) and holes (0.017 cm2 s−1).48 From the Einstein relationship (D = μkT/e), the mobility of these carriers is ∼2 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is much larger than the reported value for mobile ions (∼1.5–1.7 × 10−9 cm2 V−1 s−1).32,33 We also note that τacc is close to τslow (blue spheres in Fig. 1d), which could be a support to Zarazua's theory.14

(b) Normalized carrier density distribution is calculated as a function of the distance from the illumination center, with estimated D = 0.12 cm2 s−1 and a lifetime = 10 ms. The gray line indicates the distance from the illumination spot to the dark device, corresponding to 10−3% of the carrier concentration of the illuminated position (distance = 0). 
Temperature dependence
In addition to the migration property, the temperature dependence of the faster relaxation is measured. Fig. 7 shows the temperature dependence of −Im(R). It is clear that τfast is faster at higher temperature. As shown in the inset of Fig. 7 (the Arrhenius plot, fmin ∼ 1/T), the activation energy is calculated to be 0.124 eV which agrees with the previously reported value.54 This conclusion indicates that the accumulated charges must be thermally activated from the bent band valley before it could get involved in the recombination with the free carriers.

Ionic motion
Throughout this paper, we are discussing mainly about the faster dynamic processes which are too fast for the ionic motion. As introduced at the beginning, the explanation for the slower processes is not simple. We did not exclusively ascribe τslow to any particular process, since we do not have evidence to conclude one way or the other within this study. In addition, from our semiquantative analysis of Fig. 6, the ionic movement is unlikely in this case. Nevertheless, one should consider another ionic effect, i.e., band bending due to inhomogeneous ion or vacancy distribution, which results in the redistribution of the accumulated carriers. This being acknowledged, we believe that we have presented hitherto unexplored consequences if such a layer exists, which is our basic assumption.
Conclusions
In summary, from the analysis of the power dependence of the IMVS signal of ITO/PTAA/MAPbI3/PC61BM/AZO/Ag, two relaxation processes are found, in agreement with the IS result reported by Zarazua et al.14 The faster relaxation rate is proportional to the light power while that of the slower one is roughly constant. We noticed that the power dependence of the faster relaxation process in PSCs is different from those in the OSCs, in which only free carriers are employed.18–21 In this regard, we assign the faster feature to the recombination between the free carriers with surface accumulated carriers. Their density should be proportional to light power, which requires that they are photogenerated and dissipate with constant lifetime. In addition, we argue that because the dominant contributor of photovoltage in the low and high light power ranges is Nacc and n respectively, the Voc–P0 relationship is different in the low and high power ranges (Fig. 2c and ref. 53). Next, we carried out a novel study using focused light beams of various spot sizes/positions. The results suggest that the charge accumulation layer can effectively spread over an area as large as ϕ 5 mm. Furthermore, assisted with the specially designed two-device J–V experiment, we showed that photogenerated charges inside the illuminated device can diffuse to the adjacent dark device as long as their electrode potentials are set to be equal. Finally, we showed that bound charges need to be thermally activated (activation energy = 0.124 eV) before they get involved in the faster recombination.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Device J–V curves of the sample.	 

 	Fig. 2  The dependence of (a) −Im(R) and (b) Re(R) on modulation frequency and light power indicating the coexistence of two recombination mechanisms especially under high excitation power. (c) Power dependence of Voc and amplitude at fmin. The power dependence of each parameter is clearly different in low and high power regions (indicated by the gray line). (d) Lifetimes of the slower process and faster process.	 
τfast ∝ P0−1.	(1)
eVoc = nkBTln(P0) + const	(2)
	(3)
Nacc ∝ P0.	(4)
dNacc/dt = GaccP0− (2π/τacc)Nacc = 0	(5)
	(6)

 	Fig. 3  Scheme of the faster IMVS signal determined by the density of the photogenerated accumulated electrons of constant lifetime (blue arrow) and their thermal activation (red arrow). For a simpler illustration, we assume the accumulated carriers are electrons here according to a previous report.39	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Illustration of free carrier generation by focused light beam and subsequent accumulation at the interface. (b) The IMVS signal independent of the light spot size. (c) J–V curves obtained from various light spot sizes. (d) The IMVS signal obtained from various excitation positions. The inset of (d) indicates the position of the laser spot relative to the device shape (magenta). The magenta line in (d) is the result obtained when the illumination spot uniformly covers the whole device. The gray lines indicate fmin. A linear y scale is used in this figure to emphasize that the difference is negligible.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Illustration of the two isolated devices with a shared perovskite layer. Only a small area of one of the two devices is illuminated and the current in the adjacent dark device is measured. (b) The light power dependence of the J–V curve with the switch open (circles) and closed (solid line). (c) The power dependence of the “short circuit” current (JSC, defined as the nonzero current at V = 0 when the other device is under illumination) and the difference of JSC between two wiring configurations (ΔJSC) of the dark device, which exclude instrumental error.	 
	(7)

 	Fig. 6  (a) Time-dependent Jsc either from the ITO-connected (red) or ITO-disconnected (green) configuration. The blue curve is the laser intensity waveform. (b) Normalized carrier density distribution is calculated as a function of the distance from the illumination center, with estimated D = 0.12 cm2 s−1 and a lifetime = 10 ms. The gray line indicates the distance from the illumination spot to the dark device, corresponding to 10−3% of the carrier concentration of the illuminated position (distance = 0).	 

 	Fig. 7  The temperature dependence of Im(R) and fmin (inset). The activation energy is calculated from the Arrhenius equation, namely reaction rate k ∝ e−Ea/RT where Ea is the activation energy.
