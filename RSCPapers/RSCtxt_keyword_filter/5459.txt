    , Accepted 25th December 2020First published on 28th December 2020AbstractSubmicrometer-sized CeO2 crystals were synthesized by a hydrothermal reaction method, aiming at their use as light-scattering layers in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The morphology of the crystals was varied among a round-cornered cubic, a distinct cubic, or an octahedral shape by changing the synthetic conditions. The film formability and the light-scattering ability of the CeO2 crystals, which were coated on glass substrates by a squeegee method, were found to be dependent on their morphology according to the microstructural observation and the diffuse reflectance measurement. The effects of the CeO2 light-scattering layer were then examined for DSSCs using nanoparticulate ZnO electrodes with different thicknesses and sensitizer dyes, namely N-719 and N-749, with different absorption spectra. A short-circuit photocurrent density could be enhanced, for example, from 11.20 to 14.15 mA cm−2, by stacking the CeO2 layer on the ZnO electrode. The effectiveness of the light-scattering layer in the CeO2/ZnO electrodes was discussed based on the CeO2 crystal morphology and the CeO2 film microstructure after the systematic investigation.
1. Introduction
In typical dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), metal oxide semiconductors, sensitizer dyes, transparent conductive glass substrates, redox electrolytes, and Pt counter electrodes are the major components that determine the characteristic cell parameters, namely, the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), the fill factor (ff), and the power conversion efficiency (η). In particular, the microstructure of metal oxide semiconductor electrodes greatly influences these parameters and hence there have been many reports on the effective microstructural control of TiO2,1–3 ZnO,4–7 SnO2,8,9 Nb2O5,10 and Zn2SnO4.11 In this study, we mainly aimed at the improvement of Jsc by controlling the entire structure of the semiconductor electrodes. ZnO was selected because of its excellent tunability of the microstructure as well as its high mobility of electrons.
When the semiconductor electrodes are constituted by nanoparticles, they tend to fail to trap the longer-wavelength region of the incident light. This is due to the diminished Rayleigh scattering, which is proportional to λ−4 (λ: wavelength of the incident light), inside the electrodes. The light harvesting efficiency is then suppressed and hence Jsc is lowered in DSSCs. Although an increase in the thickness of the electrodes can improve the light trapping properties, it would deteriorate the electron collection efficiency due to the extended electron diffusion distance. Another plausible way is to introduce larger particles working as light-scattering centers within the electrodes. The larger particles for this purpose can be the same semiconductor material, like ZnO,12 or different photochemically inactive materials. They are stacked on the nanoparticulate semiconductor electrodes and scatter the incident light transmitted from the electrode side. A part of the scattered light is to be absorbed by sensitizer dyes loaded on the semiconductor electrodes to increase the photocurrent. Successful results have been reported with the use of TiO2, ZnO, or CeO2 materials so far.12–16 However, it is still unclear how the morphology of the scattering particles influences the DSSC performance and how the stacking electrode structure is related to the Jsc improvement. There is also concern that the stacked scattering particles may impede the interfacial contact between the redox electrolytes and the semiconductor electrodes.
In the present work, we have used CeO2, which was reported to show a variety of morphology,17–19 as the light-scattering particle because of its high transparency against visible light as well as its high refractive index around 2.2.20,21 The morphology of CeO2 was varied by changing its synthetic conditions in a hydrothermal reaction method. The CeO2 particles were then stacked on nanoparticulate ZnO films with well-defined thicknesses. Two kinds of Ru-complex dyes, namely N-719 and N-749, were employed to clarify an overall optical effect of the stacking electrode structure on the DSSC performance.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of CeO2 particles
Three different reaction solutions were employed to synthesize morphologically varied CeO2 particles through the hydrothermal reaction method. The first reaction solutions (designated as RS1) were prepared by dissolving 1.00 (RS1-1), 3.00 (RS1-3), or 6.00 (RS1-6) mmol of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (98.0% purity, FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation) and 1.00 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, K90, a molecular weight of 630000, Tokyo Chemical Industries) in 40 mL of deionized water, followed by magnetic stirring for 30 min. The resulting solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 160 °C for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature rapidly, precipitates were centrifuged at 9000 rpm for 20 min, washed with deionized water, and dried at 60 °C for more than 24 h. The CeO2 particles thus obtained were annealed to remove residual PVP. That is, a furnace was preheated at 450 °C, the particles were put into the furnace and kept there for 1 h, and then the particles were taken out from the furnace and cooled naturally in air.
The second reaction solution (RS2) was prepared by mixing two kinds of aqueous solutions. 2.30 mmol of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O was dissolved in 5 mL of deionized water. Separately, 0.56 mol of NaOH (95.00%, Taisei Kagaku) was dissolved in 35 mL of deionized water. The Ce(NO3)3 solution was then added dropwise to the NaOH solution, followed by magnetic stirring for 30 min. The resulting solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 200 °C for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature rapidly, precipitates were centrifuged, washed, and dried in the same manner as described above. The CeO2 particles thus obtained were used as they were.
The third reaction solution (RS3) was prepared by dissolving 2.30 mmol of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O and 0.100 mmol of Na3PO4·12H2O (99.0%, Kanto Chemical) in 40 mL of deionized water, followed by magnetic stirring for 30 min. The resulting solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 24 h. The rest of the procedure was the same as above. The CeO2 particles thus obtained were also used as they were.
2.2. Fabrication of CeO2 films
Each 0.100 g portion of the above synthesized CeO2 particles and 0.0800 g of polyethylene glycol (PEG, a molecular weight of 500000, Wako) were added to a dispersion medium consisting of 1.00 mL of ethanol (99.0%, Amakasu Chemical Industries) and 0.500 mL of deionized water, followed by stirring for 30 min under ultrasonication. The resultant CeO2 pastes were coated on slide glass substrates (Matsunami Glass Industries) with a plastic-tape mold by a squeegee method. The coated pastes were heated at 450 °C for 10 min in air. The CeO2 films thus obtained were used to evaluate their microstructure and light-scattering properties.
2.3. Fabrication of ZnO and CeO2/ZnO films
0.300 g of commercial ZnO nanoparticles (Sakai Chemical Industry) with a diameter of 40 nm was added to a dispersion medium consisting of 20.0 μL of acetic acid (99.7%, Wako), 1.00 mL of ethanol, and 0.500 mL of deionized water, followed by stirring for 30 min under ultrasonication. The resultant ZnO paste was coated on the slide glass or a fluorine-doped tin oxide-coated glass (FTO-glass) substrate (sheet resistance = 10 Ω sq−1; Nippon Sheet Glass) with the plastic-tape mold by the squeegee method. The coated paste was heated at 450 °C for 10 min in air to obtain a ZnO film (designated as ZnO-1). A thicker film (ZnO-2) was also fabricated by repeating the above coating procedure once more.
CeO2/ZnO films were fabricated by coating the above-mentioned CeO2 pastes on the ZnO-1 or the ZnO-2 film with the same squeegee method. The coated films were then heated at 450 °C for 10 min in air. In this procedure, the original ZnO films (ZnO-1 and ZnO-2) were forced to be heated again at 450 °C for 10 min. Therefore, the ZnO films used without stacking the CeO2 layer were also heated again at 450 °C for 10 min in air to regulate the heat-treatment conditions among the ZnO semiconductor films in all the samples.
2.4. Characterization
The crystal structure of the samples obtained were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis using CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) with a Bruker AXS D8-02 diffractometer. The morphology and the microstructure of the samples were observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) with a Hitachi S-4700 or a JEOL JSM-7600F microscope. Optical transmission spectra of the film samples and absorption spectra of dyes were measured with a JASCO V-670 ultraviolet (UV)-vis spectrophotometer. Diffuse reflection spectra were measured using the same spectrophotometer equipped with a JASCO ISN-723 integrating sphere without using a reflector.
2.5. DSSC measurement
Photoanodes were obtained by immersing the ZnO or the CeO2/ZnO films fabricated on the FTO-glass substrates in a 3.0 × 10−4 mol dm−3 ethanolic solution of [RuL2(NCS)2]:2TBA (L = 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid and TBA = tetrabutylammonium; N719, Solaronix) or [RuL′(NCS)3]:3TBA (L′ = 2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridyl-4,4′,4′′-tricarboxylic acid; N749, Solaronix) at 60 °C for 90 min. The amount of N719 or N749 dyes adsorbed on the films was estimated by measuring the absorbance of desorbed dyes. Desorption was carried out by immersing the photoanodes in a 0.5 mol dm−3 NaOH water–ethanol (1:1 in volume) solution.
The photoanodes were assembled into a sandwich-type open cell using a platinum plate as a counter electrode and a polyester film with a thickness of 50 μm as a spacer. An I−/I3− redox couple electrolyte, which was composed of 0.1 mol dm−3 LiI (97.0%, Wako), 5.0 × 10−2 mol dm−3 I2 (99.8%, Kanto), 0.6 mol dm−3 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (Kanto), and 1.0 mol dm−3 4-tert-butylpyridine (96.0%, Sigma-Aldrich) in 10 mL of 3-methoxypropionitrile (99.0%, Wako), was introduced between the electrodes. An active cell area was fixed at 25 mm2 by a mask. The photocurrent density (J) and the photovoltage (V) of the cells were measured under AM 1.5 illumination at 100 mW cm−2. A 500 W Xe lamp (Ushio UXL-500SX) was used as a light source. An AM 1.5 filter, a water filter, and an infrared cut filter (Hoya S76-HA50) were placed in the light path to regulate the light in a wavelength range of 300–800 nm, reducing the mismatch between the simulated and the natural sunlight.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of CeO2 particles
We first evaluated the CeO2 particles in terms of their morphology and film forming characteristics. From the XRD analysis, all the particles were identified as CeO2 with the cubic fluorite-type structure (Fig. S1†). The crystallinity of the CeO2 particles depended on the reaction conditions, as determined from the broadening of the diffraction peaks. The particles from the RS2 and RS3 solutions without the polymer additive showed the higher crystallinity because of the direct crystal growth of CeO2 in the liquid medium. In the presence of PVP, the CeO2 particles were formed as aggregates of the primary nanoparticles and hence the XRD peaks were broadened.
The morphology of the CeO2 particles could be varied by using different kinds of the reaction solutions. As shown in Fig. 1 (see also Fig. S2† as large-scale images), the CeO2 particles from the RS1 solutions have a shape of a round-cornered cube. Moreover, the size of the particles depends on the concentration of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O in the RS1 solutions: 166 ± 21 (RS1-1), 373 ± 58 (RS1-3), and 957 ± 230 nm (RS1-6). In contrast, the particles from the RS2 solution have a distinct cubic shape. The length of one side of the cubic particles is 148 ± 74 nm in average. The NaOH concentration of the RS2 solution is approximately 14 mol dm−3. The Ce(OH)3 species is initially formed when preparing the reaction solution. At a higher temperature under the hydrothermal conditions, the solubility of the Ce(OH)3 species is enhanced, the Ce3+/Ce4+ oxidation is promoted, and the less soluble CeO2 is formed. The direct crystal growth of CeO2 reflects the crystallographic feature of the cubic fluorite-type structure, thereby forming the cubic-shaped particles.
 Fig. 1  FESEM images of the CeO2 particles obtained from the RS1 (RS1-1, -3, and -6 corresponding to the Ce3+ concentrations), the RS2, and the RS3 solution through the hydrothermal reaction. 
Interestingly, the particles from the RS3 solution have a distinct octahedral shape. The length of one side of the octahedral particles is 233 ± 51 nm in average. The dissolution of Na3PO4 is expressed by the following reactions: Na3PO4 → 3Na+ + PO43−(1) PO43− + H2O ⇌ HPO42− + OH−(2)The generation of the hydroxide ions leads to the formation of the Ce(OH)3 species in the reaction solution. It is likely that the crystal growth of CeO2 in the presence of the phosphate ions favors the development of the octahedral morphology.
The film forming characteristics of the respective CeO2 particles was examined by printing their pastes with the squeegee method. The film formability was determined by the coverage of the substrate surface, the packing of the particles, and the uniformity of the thickness; they were observed by FESEM (Fig. S3†). Among the round-cornered cubic samples, the middle-size particles (RS1-3) provided the most appropriate film structure with a thickness of approximately 3 μm. Although the paste with the cubic particles (RS2) formed the film with the apparently uniform thickness, it contained many voids because of the heavy aggregation through the adhesion between the flat surfaces of the cubes. The aggregation could be avoided in the paste with the octahedral particles (RS3) and the uniform film was obtained similarly to that from RS1-3. We then chose the films obtained from the RS1-3 and the RS3 particles for detailed examination of their light-scattering ability. They are designated hereafter as CeO2-Rc (from RS1-3) and CeO2-Oh (from RS3). The other particles (RS1-1, RS1-6, and RS2) were also investigated as the light-scattering layers of DSSCs, as described later, for better understanding the effects of the size and morphology of the CeO2 particles and the microstructure of the CeO2 films.
3.2. Light scattering of CeO2 films
The light-scattering ability of the two CeO2 films (Rc and Oh) was examined by measuring their diffuse reflectance spectra. In the measurement, the samples were set so that incident light could enter from either the slide glass substrate side or the CeO2 film side.
As shown in Fig. 2, the spectra from the film side are almost the same for CeO2-Rc and CeO2-Oh. In this configuration, the intensity of the reflection is largely dependent on the diffusely scattered light inside the film; the shape of the particles is less important. On the other hand, a clear difference is seen as shown in Fig. 2 when the incident light enters from the substrate side. That is, the diffuse reflectance of the CeO2-Oh film is higher than that of the CeO2-Rc film in the entire visible light region. This is because the reflection at the substrate/film interface is enhanced in the CeO2-Oh film through the larger contribution of specular reflection by the octahedral particles. All the spectra also show a similar wavelength dependence of the diffuse reflectance, which is a typical phenomenon for the multiple scattering of the films including many light-scattering centers.22,23

In DSSCs, incident light enters from the FTO-glass substrate side to the semiconductor film. We then expected from the above results that the CeO2-Oh film would work as a light-scattering layer more effectively when stacked on the ZnO film as the FTO-glass/ZnO film/CeO2 film photoanode structure.
3.3. Structure and optical properties of ZnO and CeO2/ZnO films
The two ZnO films (ZnO-1 and ZnO-2), which were obtained by the squeegee method using the ZnO paste, were confirmed to be dense and uniform with thickness of approximately 5 and 10 μm, respectively (Fig. S4†). Four kinds of CeO2/ZnO films were then fabricated: CeO2-Rc/ZnO-1, CeO2-Oh/ZnO-1, CeO2-Rc/ZnO-2, and CeO2-Oh/ZnO-2. Fig. 3 shows cross-sectional FESEM images of the resultant CeO2/ZnO films. The CeO2 films approximately 3 μm in thickness are stacked on the ZnO films in all the films.
 Fig. 3  Cross-sectional FESEM images of the four different CeO2/ZnO films: CeO2-Rc/ZnO-1, CeO2-Oh/ZnO-1, CeO2-Rc/ZnO-2, and CeO2-Oh/ZnO-2. Arrows indicate the interface between the upper CeO2 and the lower ZnO layers. 

Fig. 4a shows transmittance spectra of the 5 μm-thick ZnO-1 and the 10 μm-thick ZnO-2 films before stacking the CeO2 films. The wurtzite-type ZnO has a band-gap energy of 3.3 eV (376 nm)24 and absorbs UV light. Because ZnO is fundamentally transparent in the visible light region, decreased transmittance in Fig. 4a is due mainly to scattering of the incident light by the films. The extent of the decrease in transmittance is dependent on the wavelength: the transmittance increases with increasing wavelength. This phenomenon is the characteristic of Rayleigh scattering. The same tendency is found in diffuse reflectance spectra of the ZnO films shown in Fig. 4b: the reflectance decreases with increasing wavelength because of the reduced light scattering. When comparing the ZnO-1 and the ZnO-2 films, the thicker ZnO-2 film exhibits lower transmittance and higher reflectance because of the enhanced light scattering. In both the films, the light transmission leads directly to the energy loss when they are applied to photoanodes of DSSCs.
 Fig. 4  (a) Transmittance spectra of the ZnO films (ZnO-1 and ZnO-2) and (b) diffuse reflectance spectra, measured from the substrate side, of the ZnO films and the CeO2/ZnO films (CeO2-Rc/ZnO-1, CeO2-Oh/ZnO-1, CeO2-Rc/ZnO-2, and CeO2-Oh/ZnO-2). 
The effects of the CeO2 stacking are clearly seen in diffuse reflectance spectra of the CeO2/ZnO films (Fig. 4b). All the spectra, including those of the ZnO films, were measured by making the incident light enter from the substrate side. One important point is that the CeO2 stacking largely increases the reflectance of the films. This means that the incident light transmitting through the ZnO films is effectively scattered backward by the CeO2 films in the glass substrate/ZnO film/CeO2 film configuration. Another important point is that the difference observed in Fig. 2 is also seen in the CeO2/ZnO films. That is, the reflectance of the films with the CeO2-Oh stacking is higher than that of the films with the CeO2-Rc stacking. This should influence the performance of the CeO2/ZnO films as photoanodes.
3.4. DSSC performance of CeO2/ZnO films
According to the literature,25 the CeO2 nanoparticles can show photovoltaic response because of the enhanced electronic transport in the presence of many surface defects. We then examined the DSSC performance of an N-719-sensitized CeO2-Rc film, which was coated on the FTO-glass substrate, because the corresponding RS1-3 particles were the aggregates of the primary nanoparticles. The characteristic cell parameters were measured to be Voc = 0.478 V, Jsc = 0.08 mA cm−2, ff = 0.370, and η = 0.01%. Thus the photovoltaic response is limited and is also negligible when stacked on the ZnO film as the light-scattering layer.
The effectiveness of the CeO2 light-scattering layer in DSSCs was initially reviewed by using all kinds of the CeO2 particles obtained in the present study. The ZnO-1 film was employed as the semiconductor layer and N-719 as the sensitizer dye. First, when comparing the three round-cornered cubic particles (RS1-1, -3, and -6) with different sizes, the CeO2/ZnO film using the smaller RS1-1 particles showed the less light-scattering ability and hence the lower cell performance (Fig. S5 and Table S1†). The other two CeO2/ZnO films using the RS1-3 and the RS1-6 particles had the similar light-scattering ability. However, the larger RS1-6 particles seemed to disturb the diffusion of the I−/I3− redox electrolyte and increase the series resistance, as determined from the decreased fill factor (ff = 0.508). The same problem was also encountered in the CeO2/ZnO film using the cubic RS2 particles. That is, although the light-scattering ability was not so much different from that of the film with the RS1-3 particles, the fill factor was further decreased to ff = 0.471 by using the RS2 particles (Fig. S6 and Table S2†). Generally the large voids, as found in the CeO2 layer with the RS2 particles (Fig. S3†), are thought to be beneficial to the electrolyte diffusion. It is then conceivable that the cubic particles, accumulated near the CeO2/ZnO interface, cover the ZnO layer to suppress the interfacial electrolyte diffusion and hence diminish the cell performance. Based on these results, we next focus on the cells using the CeO2-Rc (RS1-3) and the CeO2-Oh (RS3) light-scattering layers.
Two kinds of dyes (N-719 and N-749) with different absorption spectra (Fig. 5) were employed because they were expected to reveal the relationship between the film structure and the DSSC performance. Fig. 6a compares J–V curves of DSSCs using six kinds of N-719-sensitized films: ZnO-1, ZnO-2, CeO2-Rc/ZnO-1, CeO2-Oh/ZnO-1, CeO2-Rc/ZnO-2, and CeO2-Oh/ZnO-2. The characteristic cell parameters (Jsc, Voc, ff, and η) and the amount of the loaded N-719 dyes are summarized in Table 1. A remarkable increase in Jsc from 7.46 (ZnO-1) to 11.20 mA cm−2 (ZnO-2) is due to the increased thickness of the films working as the active dye/semiconductor layer. The Jsc values are further enhanced by stacking the light-scattering CeO2 layer for both ZnO-1 and ZnO-2. The influence of the CeO2 morphology on Jsc is shown in Fig. 7a for its better understanding. In contrast to the expectation, the CeO2-Oh layer is less effective than the CeO2-Rc layer when stacked on the ZnO-1 film. We then assumed that the light scattered backward by the CeO2-Oh layer partly transmitted through the thinner ZnO-1 film again to the outside of the cell. This assumption is strengthened by the fact that the CeO2-Oh layer can enhance Jsc of the thicker ZnO-2 film, up to 14.15 mA cm−2, more effectively than the CeO2-Rc layer. Note that the cubic RS2 particles can hardly contribute to the Jsc enhancement even for the ZnO-2 film due again to the impeded electrolyte diffusion as determined from the lower fill factor (Fig. S7 and Table S3†).

 Fig. 7  Schematic illustration of the Jsc enhancement after stacking the CeO2 light-scattering layers in the DSSCs with (a) N-719 and (b) N-749. 
It is seen from Fig. 4a that the transmittance of the ZnO films is considerably higher in the longer wavelength region even for ZnO-2. The N-719 dye is not suitable for examining the light-scattering effect in this region because of the absence of the absorption band, as shown in Fig. 5. We then investigated the DSSC performance of all the films sensitized with the N-749 dye having the broader absorption band up to 800 nm. The results are shown in Fig. 6b and 7b and summarized in Table 2. Lower Jsc values of the N-749-sensitized ZnO-1 (5.56 mA cm−2) and ZnO-2 (7.08 mA cm−2) films, as compared to the above-mentioned N-719-sensitized films, come from both the higher transmittance of the ZnO films in the longer wavelength region and the lower absorbance of N-749 in the visible light region. The Jsc value is increased up to 8.59 mA cm−2 by stacking the CeO2-Rc layer on the ZnO-1 layer. Similar to the case of the N-719 dye, the CeO2-Oh layer is less effective because of the transmission of the scattered light. In contrast, a clear difference is seen in the Jsc increments between the N-719-sensitized and the N-749-sensitized CeO2-Oh/ZnO-2 films: the CeO2-Oh layer is still less effective for the ZnO-2 layer with N-749. This is because the thicker ZnO-2 film can also transmit the longer-wavelength light scattered backward by the CeO2-Oh layer.

All the results obtained above indicate that the effectiveness of the light-scattering layer on the DSSC performance depends complicatedly on the thickness of the semiconductor layer, the particle morphology and the film microstructure of the scattering layer, and the absorption bands of the sensitizer dyes. Actually, we confirmed that the Jsc enhancement was hardly observed for the eosin Y dye having an absorption peak around 530 nm (Fig. S8†). With regard to Voc, a clear trend is seen among the N719-sensitized films: Voc decreases by the introduction of the CeO2 scattering layer. In DSSCs, Voc is ideally defined as the difference between the quasi-Fermi level of the semiconductor and the redox potential.26 However, Voc is possibly lowered due to the interaction between the semiconductor and the redox electrolyte, such as the recombination of the injected electrons with the oxidized species in the electrolyte.27 In the present case, the CeO2 scattering layer might suppress the diffusion of the I−/I3− redox electrolyte inside the ZnO film, thereby increasing the electron recombination rate with I3−. This assumption could be assessed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).
In EIS of DSSCs, one can deduce the charge transport processes involved in working cells by using equivalent circuit models.28,29 Nyquist plots and an equivalent circuit are shown in Fig. S9† for our cells with the N-719-sensitized ZnO and CeO2/ZnO films. Among three distinct semicircles appearing in the plot, the second semicircle corresponds to the electron diffusion in the ZnO film and the electron back transfer to the oxidized redox species at the ZnO/electrolyte interface. A fitting analysis of the spectra indicated that the charge recombination resistance at the ZnO/electrolyte interface, represented by Rct in the equivalent circuit, was decreased after stacking the CeO2 layer on the ZnO film. Because this analysis agrees with the observed decrease in Voc, we tentatively conclude that the light-scattering layer affords both advantages (the increase in Jsc) and disadvantages (the decrease in Voc and possibly in ff) in DSSCs. The design and modification of the microstructure of the light-scattering layer would be promising for further enhancement in overall power conversion efficiencies.
4. Conclusions
The morphologically varied CeO2 particles were synthesized through the facile hydrothermal reaction processes. The CeO2 particles were then applied to the light-scattering layer of the ZnO-based DSSCs to improve their Jsc values. The film formability and the resulting microstructure of the CeO2 light-scattering layer were shown to depend on the size and the morphology of the original CeO2 particles. When stacked on the 5 μm-thick ZnO film, the round-cornered cubic CeO2 particles with an average size of 373 ± 58 nm worked better for enhancing Jsc of the N-719-sensitized cells without deteriorating the fill factor. In contrast, the octahedral CeO2 particles with an average one side length of 233 ± 51 nm formed the more effective light-scattering layers on the 10 μm-thick ZnO film with a 26% increase in Jsc. It has also been found that the optical effects need to be combined among the semiconductor film, the sensitizer dye, and the light-scattering layer for the actual improvement in the DSSC performance. The decreased Voc (and ff in some cases) after introducing the light-scattering layer is another concern that should be addressed in the future work.
