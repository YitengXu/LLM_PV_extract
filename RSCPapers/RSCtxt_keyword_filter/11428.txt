Here, a precursor solution comprising of a methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) single-crystal is applied to prepare a perovskite film to enlarge the grain size of the perovskite photosensitive layer and improve the detectivity of the PD device. Compared with the traditional precursor solutions composed of raw-materials (MAI + PbI2), the perovskite film derived from the MAPbI3 single-crystal precursor possess high crystalline quality with large grain sizes, enhanced light absorption intensity and long carrier lifetime. Thus, the PD device based on the perovskite photosensitive layer derived from the MAPbI3 single-crystal precursor achieves an improved responsivity of 0.633 A W−1 and an optimized detectivity of 2.502 × 1011 Jones under 660 nm illumination with a light intensity of 1.25 mW cm−2 at −0.4 V. This research highlights an innovative application of perovskite single-crystals for thin film devices.
1. Introduction
The application of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have attracted considerable attention since the first report on perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) light absorbers.1–3 In recent years, perovskite materials have been widely studied as photosensitive layers in solar cells,1–5 light-emission diodes6,7 and photodetectors8–10 due to their superior properties such as high absorption coefficient, high charge carrier mobility, long carrier diffusion length, wide and tunable absorption spectrum. With the development of compositions, micromorphologies and technologies of perovskite materials, the research on high performance photodetector devices with different types of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials has also become a very interesting topic.8–12
Photodetectors (PDs) that can convert light signals into detectable electrical signals have extensive applications in optical communication, video imaging, night vision, biochemical sensors and so on.13 According to different device structures, PDs based on perovskite materials are mainly categorized into two types: photoconductors14 and photodiodes.15 Photoconductor-type PDs are easier to fabricate than photodiode-type PDs. However, photodiode-type PDs usually exhibit lower driving voltages and faster response speed than photoconductor-type PDs due to the enhanced carrier extraction efficiency caused by the built-in electrical field at the junction interface.15–17 In terms of photodiode-type PDs, hole transport layers (HTLs) and electron transport layers (ETLs) are generally introduced to improve the carrier extraction and injection efficiency. Moreover, in order to reduce the dark current and enhance the detectivity, there are numerous studies on the interfacial engineering including the introduction of a contact buffer layer and trap passivation layer.18–20 However, the photoelectric properties of perovskite-based PDs are not only dependent on the device structures and interfaces, but can also be determined by the perovskite photosensitive layers. Perovskite photosensitive layers play an important role in the photoexcited carrier transport and recombination processes. The grain size, crystalline quality and trap density of the perovskite film that can be controlled by the preparation technology are crucial to the photoelectric properties of PDs. Meng et al. have recently studied the effects of the crystalline quality of perovskite films on the photodetector performance.21 The relevant results indicated that a high quality perovskite film with decreased trap density and reduced grain boundaries induced by insulating oxide substrates could help the glass/Al2O3/perovskite photodetector achieve a high responsivity of 73.12 mA W−1 and detectivity of 9.63 × 1010 Jones at the bias voltage of 15 V.21
Hitherto, there have been numerous types of optimization technologies for perovskite photosensitive layers, such as additives, solvent annealing and precursor optimization.22–25 Jen et al. have used additives in perovskite precursor solutions to enhance the crystallization of solution-processed perovskites, thus improving the performance of PSCs.22 Liu et al. employed a solvent annealing method to increase the grain size and crystalline quality of perovskite layers, and the corresponding power conversion efficiency of PSCs obtained a significant improvement due to the reduced recombination loss and defect density.23 Besides, single-crystal precursors were also proven to be an effective approach to form a perovskite layer with large grain sizes, high crystalline quality and enhanced ambient stability, which is beneficial to improve the photoelectric performances of PSCs.24,25 As we all know, single-crystal perovskites with long-range organized lattices always show excellent photoelectric properties than polycrystal perovskite films due to the reduced grain boundaries and defects in the single-crystal materials. Several studies have revealed that single-crystal perovskites possess minimal defect density, high carrier mobility, long carrier diffusion length and the ability to mitigate the charge recombination loss of the derived devices.26–28 However, because of the high light absorption coefficient of perovskite materials, single-crystal perovskites with large thicknesses could lead to the increase in the charge recombination rate of devices so that they are not suitable as the light absorber of photoelectric devices.29 Therefore, it is important to find an innovative application of single-crystal perovskites for thin film devices. For the first time, Wang et al. prepared a large-grained perovskite film using a precursor solution comprising single-crystal perovskite powders, and the perovskite film was found to be highly crystalline and possessed a negligible physical gap between each large grain.24 In addition to forming large-grained perovskite films, the single-crystal mixed perovskite precursor can also help to prepare perovskite films with precise stoichiometry. Kuang et al. fabricated dual-site alloyed FAxMA1−xPb(IxBr1−x)3 single microcrystals and employed them as encouraging precursors to form high quality perovskite films with extended grain sizes and less grain boundaries, leading to a satisfying photovoltaic performance and heartening device stability.25
Inspired by the above studies, herein, we systematically studied the effects of the MAPbI3 single-crystal precursor on the photoelectric properties of photodiode-type PDs. MAPbI3 single-crystal was employed as a precursor to form perovskite solutions and large-grained perovskite films were fabricated via a hot-casting method. Compared with the traditional perovskite solution composed of raw-materials (MAI + PbI2), the single-crystal precursor solution is more beneficial to fabricate perovskite layers with large grain sizes and high crystalline quality, which can effectively increase the photoexcited carrier lifetime and reduce the trap density. In addition, the photodiode-type PDs based on photosensitive layers derived from the MAPbI3 single-crystal precursor show a much higher responsivity and detectivity than those based on the photosensitive layer derived from the raw-material precursor.
2. Experiment
2.1. Preparation of MAPbI3 single-crystals
MAPbI3 single-crystals were prepared via a solution method.30 2.776 g of PbI2 and 0.954 g of MAI were dissolved in 5 ml γ-butyrolactone (γ-GBL) to form a 1.2 M solution. The mixed solution was stirred at 60 °C for 12 h in order to ensure that all salts were dissolved. Then, the MAPbI3 seed crystal was put into a solution, which was heated to 90 °C and remained at 90 °C in oven. After about 72 h, MAPbI3 single-crystals were obtained from the above solution. Furthermore, a single-crystal with a suitable mass was dried and polished in order to remove the surface impurities. The perovskite single-crystal precursor solution mentioned below was derived from a whole single-crystal.
2.2. Fabrication of photodiode-type PDs
Photodiode-type PDs consisted of a TiO2 compact layer, perovskite photosensitive layer, Spiro-OMeTAD layer and Au electrode. TiO2 films were deposited on fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) conductive glasses via a spin coating method. Both the MAPbI3 single-crystal precursor solution and MAPbI3 raw-material precursor solution were prepared. 0.311 g of MAPbI3 single-crystal was put into a 0.5 ml N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution to form a single-crystal precursor solution. The MAPbI3 raw-material precursor solution contained 0.231 g of PbI2 powder, 0.08 g of MAI powder and 0.5 ml of DMF. Then, the MAPbI3 precursor solutions were spin-coated on TiO2 films and heated at 100 °C for 15 min to prepare perovskite photosensitive layers. For comparison, the single-crystal precursor solution-derived perovskite film was defined as sample SCP and the raw-material precursor solution-derived perovskite film was defined as sample RMP. After that, a hole transport material (HTM) solution containing 20 ml 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), 200 ml bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI), 2 ml chlorobenzene and 183.38 mg Spiro-OMeTAD was spin-coated on perovskite layers at 2000 rpm for 45 s to form HTL. Finally, after coating Au electrodes on HTLs via a thermal evaporation method, both photodiode-type PDs based on sample SCPs and sample RMPs were prepared.
2.3. Characterizations
The crystallinity of perovskite photosensitive layers was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 Advance, Bruker, Germany) using Cu Kα radiation. The UV-vis absorption spectrum was recorded using a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Cary5000, Varian). The morphology of perovskite films was determined via scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM 6700F, Japan). Photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were recorded using an Edinburgh Instrument (FLS2100). The current–voltage (I–V) and photoresponsivity characteristics of the above two types of PD devices were measured using a Keithley 2450 Source Meter.
3. Results and discussion
The device structure and energy band diagrams of photodiode-type PDs are shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. Herein, an FTO electrode with a work function of −4.4 eV and an Au electrode with a work function of −5.1 eV were used as the cathode and anode in this photodiode-type PD, respectively. The conduction band minimum (−3.9 eV) of TiO2 is almost the same as the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of MAPbI3, whereas its valence band maximum (−7.2 eV) is much lower than the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level (−5.4 eV) of MAPbI3. Thus, the TiO2 compact layer deposited on the FTO electrode could serve as an electron extraction layer and hole blocking layer. In addition, the LUMO energy levels of Spiro-OMeTAD and MAPbI3 are matched, which is beneficial to hole extractions. Meanwhile, Spiro-OMeTAD with a shallow LUMO energy level (−2.4 eV) between the perovskite photoactive layer and Au electrode can also effectively block electrons.15 Therefore, through the synergistic action of TiO2 ETL and Spiro-OMeTAD HTL, the charge carrier separation and extraction efficiency of PDs can be effectively enhanced.

The perovskite photosensitive layer is the determining factor in an efficient PD device. Therefore, we systemically studied the crystallographic structure, morphology and optical performance of the perovskite films. Fig. 1c and d show the XRD patterns of perovskite films derived from the raw-material precursor (sample RMP) and the MAPbI3 single-crystal precursor (sample SCP). Both samples show peaks at 14.2°, 28.6°, 32.0°, 37.5° and 40.6° for the (110), (220), (222), (321) and (224) planes of a tetragonal perovskite structure with the space group I4/mcm,30–32 respectively. In addition, diffraction peaks at 26.5° in these two XRD patterns belong to the FTO electrode.32 It can be observed that sample SCP shows more diffraction peaks in the tetragonal perovskite structure. The enhanced intensity and increased number of peaks indicate the higher crystallinity of sample SCP as compared to sample RMP.24 The full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of the (110) plane of sample RMP and sample SCP are 0.16° and 0.14°, respectively. The decreased FWHM indicates that the perovskite film derived from the single-crystal precursor showed the better crystallinity.33 Moreover, the increased background in the XRD pattern of sample RMP may be related to the amorphous organic component (MAI) of the MAPbI3 film, which indicates a possible decomposition of sample RMP.34

Fig. 2a–d show the SEM micrographs of perovskite films derived from the raw-material precursor and MAPbI3 single-crystal precursor, respectively. It is obvious that the grain sizes of sample RMP are less than 100 nm, which are much smaller than those of sample SCP. Due to the increase in the grain sizes, the area of the grain boundaries of sample SCP is also much smaller than that of the sample RMP. The decreased area of the grain boundaries is beneficial to reduce trap density and carrier recombination rate.21 In addition, compared with sample RMP, the surface of sample SCP is smoother and free of pinhole. The flat surface of the perovskite film derived from the MAPbI3 single-crystal precursor could lead to the decreased charge recombination centers and the improved carrier transport efficiency.35,36

As the core material of the PD device, the optical absorption property of the perovskite layer is of great importance to the device performance. The UV-vis absorption spectra of perovskite films derived from the MAPbI3 single-crystal precursor and the raw-material precursor are shown in Fig. 3a. It is obvious that sample SCP has higher light absorption intensity than sample RMP. On the one hand, sample SCP with larger grain sizes has less grain boundaries and impurities-related defects, which could lead to the enhancement of the light absorption intensity of perovskite films.37 On the other hand, a pinhole-free and continuous perovskite film with high coverage and crystallinity is beneficial to the light absorption performance and charge transport performance of the PD device, which also explains the higher absorbance of sample SCP.38
 Fig. 3  (a) UV-vis absorption spectra, (b) steady-state photoluminescence spectra and (c) time-resolved photoluminescence spectra of perovskite films derived from the raw-material precursor and MAPbI3 single-crystal precursor. 
Moreover, the photoelectric performances of perovskite films were investigated via steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements. Fig. 3b and c show the steady-state and time-resolved PL spectra of the two samples, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3b, the PL peaks of the sample RMP and SCP are approximately 776 nm and 771 nm, respectively. The slight blue-shift phenomenon may be due to the lower trap density around the band-edge of sample SCP, which indicates that the perovskite film derived from the MAPbI3 single-crystal precursor could be more helpful in reducing the recombination loss and improving the photocurrent collection of the PD device.23 In general, the time-resolved traces reflect the transient evolution of the electron–hole population after impulsive photoexcitation and are performed by biexponential fitting to quantify the fast carrier dynamics and the slow carrier dynamics.26T1 (short decay time constant) represents the fast carrier dynamic on the surface of incidence. The initial fast decay reflects a radiative recombination occurring on the surface of the material due to the high carrier concentration.39 Otherwise, T2 (long decay time constant) represents the slow carrier dynamic with a bulk component, which could be observed through the long tail section of the TRPL curve.26,39 Because there exists various nonradiative recombination processes in the grain boundaries and defects within the grains, the time constant T2 should also reflect the carrier lifetime of the perovskite material.26,39–41 Furthermore, the fitting decay time constants (T1 and T2) are obtained via a biexponential decay fitting (eqn 1) Fit = A + B1e−t/T1 + B2e−t/T2(1)
It could be found that both the decay time constants (T1 = 4.65 ns and T2 = 31.48 ns) of sample RMP are faster than those (T1 = 47.00 ns and T2 = 144.41 ns) of sample SCP. This result suggests a larger trap-induced recombination rate in sample RMP. Consequently, there may exist a much higher trap density in sample RMP than that in the sample SCP.26,39 In addition, the bulk carrier lifetime (T2) and carrier diffusion length (LD) have a proportional relation that can be deduced from the equation mentioned below (eqn 2):26 (2)
Therefore, the larger time constant (T2) of sample SCP further indicates that the carrier diffusion length of sample SCP is much longer than that of the sample RMP. Moreover, the enhanced carrier diffusion length is of great help in improving the carrier injection from the perovskite layer to the electrodes, resulting in optimized photoelectric conversion properties of PD devices.41
Responsivity (R), external quantum efficiency (EQE) and detectivity (D*) are important parameters to evaluate the optoelectronic properties of PD devices. R reflects the quantum yield of PD devices and is defined by the following equation (eqn 3) (3)where Ilight and Idark refer to the currents under light illumination and dark, respectively, and Pin and A are incident light intensity and active area of the PD devices, respectively.13 The light current values, as a function of the incident light wavelength of the PD devices are measured. The dark current values of the PD devices based on the sample RMP and SCP are also measured to be 2.3 μA and 1.8 μA, respectively. Then, the R values as a function of the incident light wavelength are analyzed and are shown in Fig. 4a. The bias voltage during measurement is −0.4 V. It can be observed that both PD devices have a broad range of responsivity from 350 to 750 nm. Among the whole measurement range, PDs based on sample SCP show higher responsivity than PDs based on sample RMP. At the wavelength of 660 nm, PDs based on sample SCP achieve a peak R value as high as 0.633 A W−1, which is much higher than that (0.180 A W−1) of PDs based on sample RMP. The enhanced responsivity could be attributed to the decreased trap density and charge recombination centers of sample SCPs.18
 Fig. 4  Curves for (a) responsivity, (b) external quantum efficiency and (c) detectivity as a function of the incident light wavelength. 
The EQE is the ratio of the number of collected carriers to the number of incident photons and is closely related to R, which can be calculated as follows (eqn 4)13,42,43 (4)where h, c, e and λ refers to the Plank's constant, velocity of light, electron charge and wavelength of incident light, respectively. EQE is affected by photosensitive materials and reflects the photoelectric conversion capability of PD devices.15,44Fig. 4b shows the EQE values as a function of the incident light wavelength of PD devices based on samples RMP and SCP under the reverse bias of −0.4 V. By comparison, it can be concluded that the EQE value of PD based on sample SCP is three times higher than that of PD based on sample RMP. This result further illustrates that PD based on sample SCP has the stronger capability of converting light signal into an electrical signal. Moreover, as shown in the above analysis on time-resolved photoluminescence, the improved carrier injection caused by the lower trap density of perovskite films derived from the MAPbI3 single-crystal precursor is the key reason for the optimized photoelectric conversion capability of the PD device based on sample SCP. It is worth noting that the EQE values of the PD device based on sample SCP exceeded 100%, which could be explained by the additional charge carriers injected by the electrodes under the reverse bias of −0.4 V.15,45
The spectral D* at −0.4 V bias is given in Fig. 4c. D* of the PD device is proportional to R and is defined in eqn (5) as follows (5)where q is the electronic charge constant and Jdark is the dark current density.46,47D* values of the PD device based on sample SCP almost approach 1011 Jones across the wavelength range from 400 to 750 nm, indicating that it has high detection capability throughout the visible light region.18,48 At the wavelength of 660 nm, PD based on sample SCP achieves a peak D* value as high as 2.502 × 1011 Jones, while the D* of PD based on sample RMP is only 0.628 × 1011 Jones. On one hand, the decreased trap density could lead to the slow recombination rate, which is beneficial to the suppression of dark current. On the other hand, the improved carrier transport and photocurrent collection performance are conducive to enhance the light current of PD devices. Through the synergistic action of the above two aspects, the PD device based on sample SCP achieves the optimized photoelectric conversion properties.
MAPbI3-based PD devices have been widely reported and some of them are listed in Table 1. These reports include PD devices based on MAPbI3 nanowires, oxide/MAPbI3 heterojunctions and photodiode-type PD devices with different carrier transport materials.18,46,49–54 For comparison, in this study, the values of the R and D* of PD devices based on sample RMP and SCP are also shown in Table 1. We can see that the R and D* of the PD device based on sample RMP are located at the middle level. However, as shown in Table 1, R and D* of the PD device based on sample SCP derived from the MAPbI3 single-crystal precursor are better than most of the state-of-the-art PD devices and comparable with the highest results reported on PD devices based on the MAPbI3 photosensitive material. The excellent performance of the PD device based on sample SCP is mainly attributed to the improved carrier transport efficiency and photocurrent collection performance caused by the single-crystal precursor method.

In addition, to characterize the time response performance of PD devices based on sample RMP and sample SCP, the time-dependent photoresponse curves were measured under 500 nm monochromatic light illumination with a light intensity of 2.3 mW cm−2 at the bias voltage of −0.4 V. It can be observed from Fig. 5a that both PD devices based on sample RMP and sample SCP maintained steady photocurrent values and response speeds, indicating that both of the two PD devices have good reversibility and stability.49,55 When turning on the light, the current quickly increased. When turning down the light with a shutter, the current showed a sharp fall, which reflects the capacitive response of the states at the surface of perovskite films.56,57 Furthermore, through the analysis in Fig. 5a, both the rise time and decay time of the PD device based on sample SCP are about 150 ms, which are faster than the rise time (about 500 ms) and decay time (about 300 ms) of the PD device based on sample RMP, that is, the PD device based on sample SCP possesses the faster response speed than that based on sample RMP. Also, the time-dependent photoresponse curves with the “ON” and “OFF” states under 500 nm illumination at zero bias were also measured, as shown in Fig. 5b. It indicates that the as-prepared PD devices are self-powered.58,59 With the light intensity of 2.3 mW cm−2 at zero bias, the switching ratio (on/off current) of the PD device based on sample SCP was calculated as high as 400, while that based on sample RMP was only about 70. This phenomenon illustrates that the PD device based on sample SCP has the higher switching ratio, which can reflect the higher photosensitivity of this device.13 Moreover, the optimized photosensitivity could be attributed to the improved light absorption and carrier transport properties caused by the single-crystal precursor method. However, although there is a noteworthy enhancement, the switching ratio of the PD device based on sample SCP still did not show obvious superiority. Also, the unremarkable switching ratio is mainly attributed to the very weak intensity of incident light.

4. Conclusion
In this study, we systematically studied the effects of an MAPbI3 single-crystal precursor on the crystalline quality, surface morphology, optical and electrical performance of perovskite photosensitive layers. Compared with the perovskite film derived from a raw-material precursor solution (sample RMP), the perovskite film derived from a single-crystal precursor solution (sample SCP) exhibited better crystalline quality with the larger grain sizes and better light absorption performance. Due to the smaller grain boundary area of sample SCP, a reduced recombination loss was obtained, together with an improved photocurrent collection and longer carrier lifetime. Therefore, under 660 nm illumination with a light intensity of 1.25 mW cm−2 at −0.4 V bias, the PD device based on sample SCP achieved a responsivity of 0.633 A W−1 and a detectivity of 2.502 × 1011 Jones, which were four times higher than those of the PD device based on sample RMP. Furthermore, the EQE value of the PD based on sample SCP is three times higher than that of PD based on sample RMP, indicating the stronger capability of converting the light signal into an electrical signal of PD based on sample SCP. Furthermore, the higher on/off ratio further reflects the higher photosensitivity of the device based on sample SCP. Our results have proved that the single-crystal precursor method has a positive effect on the PD devices based on perovskite photosensitive layers.
