    , Accepted 28th November 2019First published on 6th December 2019AbstractHere, we report zinc sulfide quantum dots, ZnS(QDs), moored on N-doped functionalized multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) wrapped with reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The MWCNTs have a tangled network, a particular surface area, and a distinctive hollow structure that may be suitable for use as a counter electrode (CE) material. A ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO composite as the CE on a fluorine-doped tin oxide substrate in a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) was fabricated using a doctor blade technique. The electrochemical performance showed that at the electrolyte/CE interface, the ZnS(QDs) and N-doped functionalized MWCNTs wrapped with rGO (ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO) electrode has a lower transfer charge resistance (Rct) and a greater catalytic capacity than naked ZnS(QDs). A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.4% was attained for this DSSC gadget, which is higher than that of a DSSC gadget utilizing ZnS(QDs), ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs, ZnS@rGO and Pt. Also, the DSSC device using ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO had a fill factor (FF) that was better than the other counter electrodes. The cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) electron transfer measurements showed that ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO films can provide fast electron transfer from the electrolyte to the CE and great electrocatalytic activity to reduce triiodide to a CE based on ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO in the DSSC.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are promising next generation solar cells owing to their simple formation and the ability to achieve high photovoltaic (PV) productivity.1–3 Phenomenal progress has been made over the previous century in upgrading the performance and lowering the cost of creating DSSCs.2–5 A classic dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) relies primarily on a platinum Pt-based electrocatalyst as a counter electrode (CE) for reducing triiodide to iodide. The use of expensive and corroded Pt counter electrodes (CEs) restricts the future enhancement of easy DSSCs.3,6 In this respect, the other materials used to replace the Pt electrocatalyst in DSSCs (CEs) are extremely attractive. DSSCs are one of the most encouraging photovoltaic gadgets that have been used to tackle cost-effective fabrication and moderate gadget implementation in clean electricity tests.7–10 The counter electrode of the DSSCs assumes two key parts in a DSSC gadget: the reduction of I3− to I− in the transport reaction utilizing electrocatalytic reduction, and the gathering of electrons from the outer circuit. In this case, great CE materials must show a high synergistic action towards the CE reduction response and great conductivity. Presently, the noble metal Pt is the most helpful counter electrode in DSSCs, but its use is constrained due to it being an exceptional but very expensive material. In this way, it is exceptionally attractive to investigate easy and plentiful materials to supplant Pt as the counter electrodes of DSSCs for future large scale manufacture. Up until this point, various new materials have been reported as being valuable and proficient CEs of DSSCs such as metals,11 metal oxides,12–14 chalcogenides,15–18 and carbon-based materials.5,19–24 Carbon-based materials are particularly appealing because of their natural richness, take minimal effort to manufacture, and their great electrocatalytic activity.
Over the last few decades, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been considered in various fields because of their physical and chemical properties.25–27 The doping or covering and functionalizing of CNTs is considered to improve the properties of CNTs for different applications.28,29 Alteration of CNTs by filling or covering with different metal-collides, oxides, or sulfide have been widely reported, yet methods for controlling them are indispensable to researchers.30–36 Chemically altered CNTs might be enhanced to give outstanding characteristics and extraordinary potential for implementation.37–39 We have recently shown that nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) encapsulating FeNi nanoparticles could be perfect for use as CEs in DSSCs, demonstrating a great synergistic action in the redox response of the (I−/I3−) transport and a superior gadget productivity in correlation with that of the Pt CE, although Fe nanoparticles restricted to CNTs did not display adequate movement in the CE reactions of the DSSCs. Different metals can also have an exceptional impact on the electronic structure of the CNTs on the surface which would have a considerable impact on the carbon surface catalytic activity.40–42 Subsequently, it is essential to investigate the effect on the motion of the CE reactions of multiple metals decorated with CNTs and the related execution of the DSSC that gives a standardized technique for guiding the CE strategy of the DSSCs. In this way, it is important to examine the impact of various metal decorated CNTs on the movement of CE reactions and the related DSSC execution, which could give a rational method to direct the structure of the CEs of the DSSCs. Diverse nano-materials such as SnO2, ZnO, and Pt with a controlled size have been utilized for the covering of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs).43–46 One atom thick graphene and the two-dimensional layer of the sp2-bound crystal structure is a creative example of the carbon crystal family owing to its excellent properties such as thermal conductivity, high carrier mobility, transparency, and electric conductivity.45,47 In any case, neither zinc sulfide quantum dots (ZnS(QDs)), MWCNTs, nor graphene oxide (GO) can achieve remarkable conversion proficiency in DSSCs as a CE. To accomplish great proficiency for DSSCs as a CE, ZnS(QDs) attached to N-doped functionalized multiwall carbon nanotubes (N.f-MWCNTs) and wrapped with rGO could be an astounding solution. In this research, we have prepared ZnS(QDs) attached to N.f-MWCNTs and wrapped them with rGO as a CE in DSSCs for the first time. The size of the ZnS(QDs) in the filling and covering procedure of the N.f-MWCNTs surface can be constrained simply by adjusting the reaction time and temperature. The ZnS(QDs), ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs, ZnS@rGO and ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO composites have been prepared by means of the controllable and low-cost hydrothermal method.
In this research work, we have formed N-doped f-MWCNT confining ZnS(QDs), which are correspondingly assigned as N.f-MWCNT–ZnS and further surveyed their suitability as a CE for DSSCs. The results demonstrated that the composites showed a high synergistic activity in the CE reduction reaction (I3− to I−) and excellent electrochemical stability. Furthermore, the DSSC gadgets yielded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.5% for the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs framework and 9.4% for the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO, which are practically identical to or superior to the control gadget made with Pt (as the CE), indicating their potential for application in the advancement of low-cost and high productivity DSSCs.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
All of the reagents used in this study were purchased from commercial sources, they were of chemical grade and were used without further purification. Shanghai Mackin Biochemical Co., Ltd provided the pure MWCNTs, according to the producer pattern; the inner diameter of the MWCNTs was approximately 5–12 nm, the external diameter 25–50 nm, and length 10–20 μm with a purity ≥95%. Zinc acetate dihydrate (C4H6O4Zn·2H2O) (AR, 98%), sodium sulfide nonahydrate (Na2S·9H2O) (AR ≥ 98%), ammonia solution (NH4OH) (AR, 25–28%), sulfuric acid (H2SO4) (AR, 95–98%), phosphoric acid (H3PO4) (AR ≥ 85%), nitric acid (HNO3) (AR ≤ 65–69%), potassium permanganate (KMnO4) (AR, 99.5%), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (AR, 30% aqueous solution), and polyethylene glycol (C2H6O2) (AR, 99%), were purchased from Guoyao Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. Deionized (DI) water was obtained from an electrothermal distiller in our lab and used for all experiments.
The working electrode (WEs), TiO2, had an active surface area of 0.16 cm2 (0.4 cm × 0.4 cm) and a thickness of 10 μm, the Pt coated counter electrode (CE), fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) layered glass substrates “NSG, 13 Ω sq−1, 1 × 2 cm, “Dye “N719” and the electrolyte were supplied by Yingkou OPV Tech. New Energy Co., Ltd. Liaoning (Yingkou) China. According to the manufacturer's specification, these electrolytes consist of 0.6 M 1-propyl-2,3-dimethyl-imidazolium iodide, 0.5 M LiI, 0.05 M I2 and 0.5 M 4-tert-buylpyridine in acetonitrile solution.
2.2. Preparation of the ZnS(QDs) and ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs CE catalyst
The ZnS(QDs) and ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs catalysts were prepared using the hydrothermal technique.48 In brief, the N.f-MWCNTs (0.1 g, further details can be found in the ESI†) were scattered in 10 mL of ethanol and sonicated until all of the ethanol was removed from the mixture to form a homogenous solution. Subsequently, a C4H6O4Zn·2H2O (0.43902 g, 2 mmoL) and DI water (60 mL) mixed solution was added to the above solution and this was ultrasonicated for another hour to form a homogeneous solution. After this, NH4OH was added dropwise into the solution under magnetic stirring until the pH value reached 9. Subsequently, Na2S·9H2O (0.96072 g, 4 mmoL) was dissolved in DI water (10 mL) in another beaker and was added into the above mentioned solution under magnetic stirring for 1 h. After the solution was well mixed, the composite solution was poured into a Teflon-lined steel autoclave with a capacity of 100 mL and heated to 140 °C for 10 h. After the autoclave had naturally cooled down to normal temperature, the obtained precipitates were washed several times with DI water and ethanol. Lastly, the residue was gained by lyophilization at −75 °C for 24 h for subsequent use. Pure ZnS(QDs) were also prepared under the same reaction conditions but without the addition of N-doped f-MWCNTs for comparison.
2.3. Acidification and functionalization of the MWCNTs
The MWCNTs were gained from commercial suppliers, and the purity of the MWCNTs was improved by removing the carbonaceous material. Corrosive handling is a simple and helpful approach to expel the impurities and increments in the convergence of the (–COOH and –OH) functional groups by using a refluxing strategy.49–51 Corrosive handling and functionalization of the pure MWCNTs are essential for the formation of ZnS(QDs) on the surface walls of the MWCNTs. The functional groups act as sites for the nucleation of the ZnS(QDs) as oxygen-containing groups (see Scheme 1). In the ESI† one can find the point-by-point acid purification and functionalization of the MWCNTs arrangement process.

2.4. Fabrication of graphene oxide
The production of GO was performed by utilizing graphite ash using a modified “Hummer's method”, which has been reported previously.52 The detailed preparation procedure can be found in the ESI.†
2.5. Preparation of the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO CE catalyst
The ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO catalyst was prepared using the hydrothermal technique. The ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs and GO were referred to as a base material in the aqueous solution. In brief, GO (0.03 g) was added into 30 mL of ethanol solution in a beaker with a 50 mL capacity under the presence of ultra-sonication and stirred for 1 h to produce a homogeneous solution. Subsequently, the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs nanocomposite (0.09 g) was added slowly into the above described GO solution while stirring. After that, the mixture was poured into a Teflon-lined steel autoclave with a capacity of 100 mL and placed at 160 °C for 12 h. Subsequently, it was cooled at room temperature and the precipitates were rinsed with DI water and ethanol. Finally, the residue was gained by lyophilization at −75 °C for a period of 24 h for subsequent use, and the ZnS@rGO was also prepared under the same reaction conditions without the addition of N-doped f-MWCNTs for comparison. During the hydrothermal reduction process, GO was reduced to reduced graphene oxide (rGO), as the functional groups (–COOH and –OH) attached to the edges of the GO were removed.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Morphological and crystallographic investigation
The morphology of ZnS(QDs) was investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and the composites based on the ZnS(QDs) are reported in Fig. 1. Typical, TEM, high resolution TEM (HRTEM) pictures, and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of the ZnS(QDs), ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs and ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO are shown in Fig. 1a–i. In Fig. 1a, the ZnS(QDs) TEM picture displays a thin spherical-like morphology with a lateral size of approximately tens of nanometers that were firmly spread, and a size of around 20–40 nm. In Fig. 1b, the HRTEM image of the ZnS(QDs), with a measured lattice spacing of 0.28 and 0.30 nm, was in good agreement with the (200) and (111) interplanar separations of the cubic phase of ZnS which corresponded to the X-ray diffractometry (XRD) results. In Fig. 1c, the same effects were obtained from the SAED patterns. In the SAED, images a dot pattern showed that the ZnS(QDs) are single crystals. In Fig. 1d, a single hybrid nanotube is shown in the TEM image, and it can be seen that the QDs were stuck on the surface wall of the nanotubes. These results showed that joining the ZnS(QDs) to MWCNTs at room temperature was extremely troublesome. To resolve this issue, a post-refluxing treatment was performed. Fig. 1d demonstrated the TEM micrograph of the resulting ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs sample. For this sample, most of the f-MWCNTs had been attached with thick ZnS(QDs), which confirmed that the post-refluxing treatment assumed a key role in the linkage of the ZnS(QDs) and f-MWCNTs. This might be brought about by the fact that the heating treatment occupied the energy barrier associated with the interaction of the ZnS(QDs) and f-MWCNTs. However, the ZnS(QDs) were inhomogeneously scattered, while the numerous f-MWCNTs had been joined with a lot of ZnS(QDs), some bare CNTs can also be seen in Fig. 1d. The nitric acid pre-treatment on the MWCNTs created the oxygenated groups, and for the most part, the carboxylic acid on their surfaces.53 The entire surface of the f-MWCNTs was covered with ZnS(QDs), the fact that the f-MWCNTs were fastened with functional groups (–COOH and –OH), meant that the negative charges adsorbed the positive charges effectively. These functional groups effectively induced MWCNTs to aggregate because of the assembly of hydrogen bonds, particularly, in acidic media. Moreover, the HRTEM microstructure examination of the ZnS(QDs) appended with the N.f-MWCNTs is shown in Fig. 1e. In Fig. 1e, the composite ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs has a perfect crystallinity and clear lattice fringes can be observed in the HRTEM, a lattice spacing of 0.27 and 0.31 nm was measured which is comparable to the (200) and (111) interplanar separation of the cubic phase of ZnS (PDF number: 77-2100), which is in agreement with the XRD results and the SAED patterns shown in Fig. 1f which produced similar results. The HRTEM and the SAED patterns indicated diffraction rings which show the polycrystalline structure of the ZnS(QDs) linked to the f-MWCNTs. Fig. 1g and h shows the TEM images of the composites and the HRTEM images of the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO respectively. In Fig. 1g, it can be seen that the f-MWCNTs structure is throughout the composite and the ZnS(QDs) are firmly attached to the f-MWCNTs, and a small number of ZnS(QDs) are dispersed on a thin layer of rGO. The specific region of the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO sample observed from the HRTEM picture in Fig. 1h showed that the separation between two adjacent ZnS lines was approximately 0.301 nm, coordinating in the ZnS cubic phase plane (111) (JCPDS number: 77-2100). In Fig. 1i, the diffraction rings were taken from the coherent SAED pattern and show that the ZnS(QDs) were similarly polycrystalline in the composition of the f-MWCNTs and rGO.

In Fig. 2a, the lattice parameters, phase purity, and crystalline pattern of the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO and the composite are described using XRD. The XRD pattern of the ZnS(QDs), ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs, and ZnS@rGO are also shown for comparison in Fig. 2a. The ZnS(QDs) diffraction peaks identified at 28.55°, 33.08°, 47.51°, 56.28°, 59.13°, 69.52°, 76.80°, 79.15°, and 88.54° could be indexed to the (111), (200), (220), (311), (222), (400), (331), (420), and (422) planes of cubic (fcc). In the ZnS(QDs) the phase using space group, F3m(216), alongside the lattice parameters are a = b = c = 5.415 Å, which is a good arrangement of the standard (PDF number: 77-2100), and can be determined using the HRTEM and SAED results. In addition, the normal crystallite size of the particles was determined using the well-known Debye Scherrer formula: D = kλ/βcos(θ).(1)

The ZnS(QDs) crystalline size was determined by Scherrer's equation to be around 9 nm. In particular, in the XRD results of the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs and ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO, the small wide diffraction peak showed up at 2θ = 25.7°, ordered to the (210) plane of the graphitic carbon. The hexagonal phase graphitic type lattice plane has a P63/mmc(194) space group and represents a well-created composite carbon graphitization, which may be suitable for electron transmission in the composite. The widening diffraction peaks reveal the small size of the ZnS(QDs) in the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs and ZnS@rGO, and the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO composites. Additionally, for the ZnS(QDs) the main diffraction peak intensity was weaker, which confirmed the higher content of ZnS(QDs) in the composite.
The Raman spectra of the GO, ZnS(QDs), ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs, ZnS@rGO and ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO composites are shown in Fig. 2b. In Fig. 2b, the GO peaks were seen, with a D band at 1353.26 cm−1 and a G band at 1596 cm−1. In the (GO) Raman spectra, the ‘D’ band reveals the structural defects and distortion in the GO framework. The ‘G’ band corresponds to an E2g phonon mode of graphene vibration for the sp2-bonded carbon atoms in a 2′D hexagonal lattice.54 In Fig. 2b, the ZnS@rGO composite peaks are also observed, the D band is observed at 1347.71 and the G band at 1595.75 cm−1. When GO was reduced to rGO in the composite, the ‘D and G’ bands significantly changed their intensities, but the number of layers was unchanged. Furthermore, the intensity ratio of GO (ID/IG = 0.87) and ZnS@rGO (ID/IG = 1.005) was observed, which increased from 0.87 to 1.005 in the ZnS@rGO composite, which confirms the reduction of GO into rGO after the hydrothermal procedure.51 In addition, for ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs two characteristic peaks of 1353.26.75 and 1581.7 cm−1, and for ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO at 1344.8 and 1587.2 cm−1 were also observed. Similarly, the intensity ratio of the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs D to G band (ID/IG = 0.99) was observed, which increased to (ID/IG = 1.005) in the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO composite, which also confirmed that the GO is reduced into rGO through the hydrothermal route as shown in the inset of Fig. 2b for the ZnS(QDs).
To study the specific surface area and the particle size distribution of the ZnS(QDs), ZnS@N.f-MWCNT, ZnS@rGO, and ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO hybrids, N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm studies were performed and are shown in Fig. 2c–d. The particle size distribution curve of the ZnS(QDs), ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs, ZnS@rGO, and ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO hybrids are shown in Fig. 2d. Table 1 shows that the specific surface region of the ZnS(QDs), ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs, ZnS@rGO, and ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO hybrids obtained using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis reached 164.063, 186.240, 183.085 and 306.242 m2 g−1, with a particle size distribution of 3.95, 9.80, 3.9, and 1.60 nm, and a total particle volume of 0.1622, 0.4567, 0.3569, and 1.2290 cm1 g−1, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2d. This suggests that the specific surface region of the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO composite was higher than that of ZnS(QDs), ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs, ZnS@rGO composites, this is mainly due to the introduction of MWCNTs and GO with a large number of particle structures. The exceptional surface area of the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO composite can increase the contact area and give more electro-active sites between the electrolyte/CE, enhancing the kinetics of electron transport, as well as enhancing the catalytic activity of the electrode materials in energy conversion devices.48

The surface science, chemical composition, and elemental valence states of the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO nanocomposite were researched using the XPS strategy. Fig. 3a shows the assessed atomic weight rates. Carbon rules in the composite and the content of Zn, S, and N were extremely low. These results supported the fruitful doping of N, S heteroatom, and the development of ZnS in the composite. In Fig. 3b, the survey scan of the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO composite is displayed and demonstrates the existence of Zn, S, C, and N in the substrate. The key peaks for the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO nanocomposites are: 89.27 eV (Zn 3p) and 1021.73 eV (Zn 2p3), 161.8 eV (S 2p), 225.8 eV (S 2s), 285.6 eV (C 1s), 398.6 eV (N 1s), and 533.12 eV (O 1s).55 As no deceptive peaks are available, the survey sweep affirms the pristine test setup of the sample fabrication process and nanostructure development. In this manner, it can be effectively inferred that ZnS(QDs) have been effectually formed, and have been added into the N.f-MWCNTs, and rGO network by the hydrothermal method. Further detailed data about the bond setup of each component was revealed using high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra. In Fig. 3c the samples from ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO showed a high-resolution Zn 2p spectrum. The Zn 2p ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO spectrum was separated into three stages, with comparative binding energies of 1022, 1022.64, and 1045.5 eV. The peak at 1022 eV was assigned to the Zn–S bond. The peak at 1022.64 eV is attributed to the Zn 2p3/2 bond and the peak at 1045.5 eV represents the Zn 2p1/2 bond. Fig. 3d displays the S 2p high-resolution XPS. The 162.35 and 163.00 eV binding energy peaks can be assigned to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively.55Fig. 3e shows the C 1s high-resolution XPS. The C 1s spectrum of ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO can be deconvoluted into four sections at approximately 284.78, 285.08, 286.17, and 289.57 eV, respectively. The peak at 284.8 eV is ascribed to the rGO bonds C–C or the adventitious elemental carbon. The peak at 285.08 eV is ascribed to the rGO bond C–O–C, and the peak at 286.17 eV can be ascribed to the CO bond, and the peak at 288.5 eV is attributed to the rGO CO–O bond.56 After reduction, the intensities of the C 1s peak binding to oxygen declined considerably. This phenomenon indicated that the largest part of the species which contains the oxygen is disposed of and that the conjugated C structures are maintained during the reduction procedure. This indicates that GO was reduced to rGO during the preparation of the composite ZnS@rGO and the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO.57 In Fig. 3f, the spectrum with a high resolution of N 1s shows that the ‘N’ element consists of three states; pyridinic N (399.11 eV), pyrrolic N (400.23 eV), and graphitic N (402.5 eV). To check the pyrrolic–N with 2 p-electrons in the p-framework and the pyridinic–N with a 1 p-electron supply, both the pyrrolic–N and pyridinic–N were placed at the graphene plane boundaries. Therefore, pyrrolic N has a greater binding energy than the pyridinic N. Thereby, graphitic–N represents N-atoms that have been doped into the sheets of the graphene in the hexagonal rings by the atoms of C.58–60 The N-doped sites may also be associated with metal sulfides owing to the comparatively small size of the ZnS(QDs) and their incredible dispersion. Nitrogen doping in the surface walls of CNTs can improve their synergistic movement in the reduction reaction and improve the wettability of a polar solvent; as a result, the effectiveness is ideal for use as a CE in DSSC devices.61

3.2. Photoelectric properties of the as-synthesized CE catalyst
In this research study, we selectively built DSSCs to examine the photoelectrical characteristics using the samples as counter electrodes. Therefore, for instruments fitted with distinct CEs, we carried out electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), Tafel polarization, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) experiments.

3.2.1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy investigations. 
The electrocatalytic activity can be assessed using EIS measurements. To examine the interfacial charge transfer method between the CEs and the electrolyte solution, and the electrocatalytic activity of the cell in the DSSC, an EIS examination was performed and is shown in Fig. 4a. In this, the ion reduction of I3− in the CEs and the equivalent circuit have been extensively used.62 This is a useful way to illustrate the electrocatalyst of all of the different pairs of electrodes, which can clearly explain the internal interface charge transport system. In EIS analysis, three semicircles can be observed in the Nyquist curves, which show the different impedance of the DSSC. It is remarkable that in Fig. 4a there are two semicircles observed. The first semi-circle on the left indicates the high-frequency area in the Nyquist curve that is attributed to the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the CE/electrolyte interface and represents the catalytic activity of the CE for I3− reduction. The second left and the next tailing curve have low frequencies that are assigned to the “Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN)” between the (triiodide/iodide) redox couple in the electrolyte solution,63 and the Warburg diffusion progression (I−/I3−) in the electrolyte (Rdiff), respectively.64 The series resistance (Rs) was attributed to the high frequency which is intercepted on the real axis (Z′-axis).65 All of the calculated values for Rs and Rct are given in Table 2. In Fig. 4a, the Nyquist plots, and the corresponding circuit are shown for the ZnS(QDs), ZnS@rGO, ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs, and ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO composites as CEs and for Pt as well as a comparison. In the Nyquist results, the reduced (Rct) for ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO is around 0.20 Ω cm2, which is lower than that of Pt (0.51 Ω cm2), ZnS@rGO (0.21 Ω cm2), and ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs (0.35 Ω cm2). The best performance based carbon electrodes for DSSCs have exceptional stability in terms of the electrocatalytic activity. The Rct of the CE should also be lower, this is consistent with the excellent exchange current density, as indicated in Fig. 4a. Owing to the impedance in the DSSCs, the electron passage mechanism was affected.66,67Fig. 4a reveals that among the five electrodes, the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO based CE exhibits the lowest Rct with a larger Jo and Jlim. The quicker charge-movement energy is related to the lower Rct, which enhanced the area of the CE subjected to electrocatalytic subjected activity. Upon introduction of N more additional active sites are exposed. The graphene electrocatalytic activity for triiodide reduction frequently rises by expanding the number of defect sites, which is comparable to functional groups containing oxygen in rGO.66 An integrated graphene layer may have a reduced resistance to charge movement (Rct), but a controlled active site may be used to catalyze the response to the triiodide reduction. The electrocatalytic active sites can be formed by doping carbon-based materials with heteroatoms (P, N, and B) with limited changes in the length of the conjugation. Different chemical functionalization of graphene was used in the electrocatalytic active sites, damaging the conjugating structure with a decreasing electrical conductivity linked to the basal graphitic plane.68 In addition, heteroatom doping was developed to enrich the surface hydrophilicity and the electrical conductivity to facilitate the interaction and transfer of electrolyte electrodes.68–70 Owing to the improved photocurrent density (Jsc), an effective decrease from I3− to I− can accelerate the renewal of anodized dyes. In the current work, values of the (Rct) for ZnS(QDs), ZnS@rGO, ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs, ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO, and the reference Pt of 315.76, 0.21, 0.35, 0.20, and 0.51 Ω cm2, respectively, were observed. The EIS tests confirmed that the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO composite gave an enhanced PCE at a lower ‘Rct’ compared to the reference Pt. Nevertheless, a lower Rct would prompt a reduced series resistance which would help to improve the fill factor (FF) of the cells. The small Rct of the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO composite based CE affirmed that reduced energy losses at the electrolyte/CE interface were observed when these were compared with the other non-hybrid CEs. The reduced (Rct) of the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO composite based CE gave a greater FF of about 66.5% in the DSSCs. Based on the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO composite CEs need to show an equivalent performance when compared with the Pt cell, which is around (67%). The current density (Jo) can also be found using eqn (2).71,72

3.2.2. Tafel polarization investigation. 
The Tafel polarization evaluations were also executed for the ZnS(QDs) CEs to observe the catalytic activity. Furthermore, examination of the properties of the (I−/I3−) redox couple exchanging on the surface of each CEs were performed.73 The Tafel curves of the different CEs exhibited in Fig. 4b demonstrate the logarithmic current density as a function of the potential. In the Tafel polarization measurements, the two key parameters, that is, the limiting diffusion current density (Jlim) and the exchange current density (Jo) are strongly associated with the catalytic activity of the samples. In general, the Tafel plot comprises three areas, these are diffusion, Tafel and polarization area.74–76 To evaluate the catalytic activity of the CE for I3− reduction the Tafel and diffusion area can be studied. The incline of the cathode leg can be evaluated by utilizing the Tafel area. Furthermore, the Jo represents the catalytic activity between the CE materials and the electrolyte, which can be obtained by the deduction phenomenon in the Tafel plots.77 Meanwhile, Jlim is a more important parameter that can be used to examine the efficiency of the DSSCs.78,79Jo and Jlim can be calculated using eqn (2) and (3) and are listed in Table 2. In these experimental results, the left prong of the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO composite of the Tafel curve was higher. This demonstrated a greater Jo, and a similar and higher catalytic activity than conventional Pt, as shown in Fig. 4b. The sharp gradient of the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO was higher than that of Pt, which confirmed that it has a higher Jo, that was in good agreement with the EIS data. Additionally, ZnS(QDs) have a reduced Jo which shows that the catalytic activity of ZnS(QDs) is reduced. In addition, the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs and ZnS@rGO displayed a restrained Jo. The Jlim can be observed as the interaction of the cathode leg and the Y-axis, which can evaluate the diffusion properties of the redox pairs. A greater Jlim displayed superior diffusion at the same potential. In Fig. 4b, the Jlim value of the composite ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO is higher as compared to the reference Pt and is also better than those of the ZnS(QDs), ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs and ZnS@rGO. Therefore, both parameters Jo and Jlim are strongly associated with the catalyst. Therefore, ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO is the substituted hybrid material that has a higher photovoltaic performance and a greater diffusion velocity when used as a CE in DSSCs. In eqn (2) and (3), we can also find the Jo and Jlim, respectively and the values of the EIS and Tafel polarization plots are detailed in Table 2. All of the calculated values found using the formulae are in accordance with the EIS results. (2) (3)


3.2.3. Cyclic voltammetry scanning investigations. 
A CV test was performed for the analysis of the catalytic performance of the differing CEs. The CV framework comprises a three electrode system, a CE utilized as the Pt leaf, the reference electrode (RE) utilized as an immersed calomel electrode, and the working electrode (WE) utilized as a counter electrode. All of the CV curves are exhibited in Fig. 5a, there are two couples of Ox and Red peaks, corresponding to the (Oxidation 1)/(Reduction 1) and (Oxidation 2)/(Reduction 2). The catalytic reactions can be exposed using the two pairs of Ox and Red peaks by using the eqn (4) and (5). To survey the electrocatalytic movement of the ZnS(QDs), ZnS@rGO, ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs, and ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO as CEs to reduce I3− to I− in the DSSC framework, the CV was first estimated with the sputtered Pt CE as the control sample. In the three electrodes system, two typical sets of oxidation–reduction peaks were evaluated. In the CV plots the left couple (A) is relegated to the oxidation (Ox1) and reduction (Red1) peaks which belong to the oxidation–reduction of (I−/I3−), which occurs at the surface of or inside the CE. The right couple (B) “Ox2 and Red2” is attributed to the oxidation (Ox2) and reduction (Red2) peaks of (I3−/I2) on the CE surface.61 In this manner, the left couple of peaks in the CV plots firmly correspond with the synergistic capability of the CEs of DSSCs in the reduction of I3− to I−, and further investigations were centered around this. The peak current density may reflect the synergistic activity of the CE, and a greater peak current density means a greater catalytic activity. Fig. 5a clearly shows that the peak current density of the five CEs is in the order Pt, ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO, and at the same time the inset figure ZnS(QDs), ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs, ZnS@rGO suggesting that the synergistic action of the reduction reaction occurring at the CEs is in a similar order. The two sets of “ox and red” peaks, as shown in eqn (4) and (5), can expose the synergist responses for (I−/I3−), for example; I3− + 2e− ⇌ 3I−(4) 3I2 + 2e− ⇌ 2I3−.(5)

(c) CV plots at different scan rates of the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO CE. (c) Linear relationship between (scan rate)1/2 (mV s−1)1/2 and the cathodic/anodic peak current densities. 
In eqn (4) and (5), respectively, the redox reaction depicted as the negative and positive couple assigned to the redox appears. This has an instant effect on the DSSC efficiency and the profound impact is demonstrated, respectively, in eqn (4) and (5). In the CV evaluation of the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO composite, it was evident that the “shape and position” of the positive/negative reduction and oxidation peaks was comparable to that of the Pt electrodes, which indicated that both represent Pt as an electrolytic motion for the reduction of I3−. Also, the peak to peak separation (ΔEpp) and the peak current density between the (anodic/cathodic) curves are two significant restraints for resembling the catalytic action and performance of the ZnS(QDs), ZnS@rGO, ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs, ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO based composites and Pt CE, as shown in Fig. 5a. The ΔEpp adversely corresponds with the standard electrochemical rate constant of the (reduction/oxidation) reactions. The high peak current density and small ΔEpp indicate that the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO composite based electrode has a better catalytic action for the reduction of (I3−), which is an essential condition for an outstanding counter electrode in a DSSC. In addition, the ΔEpp is inversely proportional to that of the ordinary electrochemical rate of the redox reaction; the right catalytic action reveals smaller values of ΔEpp.80 The (ΔEpp) of ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO is not as noticeable as that of Pt, which shows that the prospective loss of ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO (CE) is not as much as the loss of the Pt CE in DSSCs, as shown in Fig. 5b. Furthermore, the ΔEpp of ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO (0.12 V) is small in contrast to Pt (0.22 V), the low value of ΔEpp shows an improved reversible redox reaction for (I−/I3−) and electrochemical polarization.13 The plots of the CV were analyzed in ZnS(QDs), ZnS@rGO, ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs, ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO and Pt CE, as displayed in Fig. 5a, Table 2. It can be seen that the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO peak current density linked to the reduction reaction for I3− to I− is better than that of Pt, which indicates an excellent catalytic motion for I−. In the meantime, the relative scan rate CV curves of the ZnS(QDs), ZnS@rGO, ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs are shown in Fig. 5a (inset). The CE surface ‘triiodide/iodide’ ions undergo a smooth redox reaction; therefore, sensitizer regeneration is best suited. We have also examined the CV recorded at various sweep rates: 10, 30, 50, 70, and 100 mV s−1, correspondingly for ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO. The link between the scan rates and the maximum oxidation/reduction peaks was determined. The increase in the scanning speed increases the anodic and cathodic peak densities. A direct connection between the peak current densities and the square root of the scanning rates was discovered alongside the progressive increase in the scanning velocity, as shown in Fig. 5c and d. This phenomenon showed that there is no chemical reaction between the redox couples (I−/I3−) and the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO CEs.81 A direct connection demonstrates that the cathodic/anodic reactions have restricted the diffusion for the transportation of iodide species in the cells toward the CE. This is because the diffusion layer becomes smaller as the scanning speed rises, and the electrochemical polarization also increases, resulting in a high overpotential and diminished reversibility.23
In addition, in the CV analysis, the electrochemical stability of the CEs is a vital factor, which can influence the potential applications of the DSSCs. To assess the electrochemical stability of the ZnS(QDs), ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs, ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO and Pt, 30 CV cycles with a scanning speed of 25 mV s−1 were also executed, demonstrating that the electrochemical stability of the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO CE is significantly better than all of the other CEs, as shown in Fig. 6a–d. These outcomes proved the excellent stability of the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO CE, which can be ascribed to the way that the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs are wrapped inside the rGO, and are shielded from filtering and corrosion by the electrolyte. The peak to peak separation (ΔEpp) and the cycle number also display the stability of the nanocomposite materials. In the interim, it was unrealistic to check the cyclic performance of the ZnS(QDs) based CEs because the oxidation/reduction peaks were not obviously seen. It can be obviously seen in the CV plots in Fig. 6b that for 30 cycles there is less electro-synergistic activity in the ZnS(QDs), and there are low redox peaks in the oxidation process; however, there are no peaks in the reduction process. The ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs redox peaks were diverse when compared with the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO and Pt, and the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs peaks were more extensive and cannot be recognized at a lower potential. This kind of result has also been found in amorphous carbon. In this investigation, the results indicated that the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO based CEs have enhanced the catalytic activity. ZnS(QDs) are suitable catalytic materials for DSSCs, and the performance of the ZnS(QDs) with N.f-MWCNTs and rGO is shown in Scheme 2.

 Scheme 2  The performance of the counter electrode material is optimized by introducing N.f-MWCNTs with rGO. 
As mentioned above, ZnS(QDs) are excellent catalytic materials for DSSCs. The ZnS(QDs) are controlled through agglomeration. In the meantime, the ZnS(QDs) are totally exposed to the electrolyte which has a corrosive action, this interrupts the structure and gradually reduces the catalytic activity. When the N.f-MWCNTs are dispersed into the ZnS(QDs), the issues regarding agglomeration are addressed. The stability of the CV analysis also improves to some degree because the ZnS(QDs) were attached and are surrounded by the CNTs, as shown in Fig. 6c and Table 2. Nevertheless, the CV stability of the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs composite has not achieved the perfect state, because the ZnS(QDs) are still presented to the electrolyte. Furthermore, the rGO encapsulates the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs because of the more prominent adaptability of the rGO. Therefore, it was found that this improved the CV stability, and also upgraded the PCE. Also, the interfacial connections assume a significant role in the exhibition of the materials.82,83 It is satisfying to note that the performance of the composite is improved in Fig. 6d and in Table 2. Here, the N parts for the modified f-MWCNTs are provided, and the interface interaction is enhanced. Meanwhile, the heteroatom (N) carbon connection could produce a reduction in the conjugation length owing to N-doping in the electro-catalytic active sites. N-doping has been shown to enhance the electrical conductivity and can even perform electro-catalytic operations to accelerate the charging and electrolyte interactions, respectively. N-doping of carbon nanotubes and graphene84 has shown that the elevated electronic catalytic activity of the N-doped carbon components improves the long-term operational stability and provides greater resilience to fuel cell poisoning.85,86 During N-doping, it shows more electro-catalytic activity as a CE because of the structural distortion.66


3.2.4. Photovoltaic performance of N719 in DSSCs. 
To check the excellent photovoltaic properties of ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO in DSSCs, a conceptual figure of the working principle of a DSSC using ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO as the CE is presented in Fig. 7a. Photocurrent voltage (J–V) plots are used to assess the performance of the DSSCs created with numerous CEs under irradiation at AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2) and are exhibited in Fig. 7b and c. The photovoltaic behavior is significant for the exhibition of the DSSCs, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are recorded in Table 3. Notably, the cell prepared using the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO achieved a high PCE of 9.4%, FF of 66.5%, Voc of 0.78 V, and Jsc of 18.12 mA cm−2. This is similar to the Pt photovoltaic cells for DSSCs which were used as a reference: the Jsc was 16.09 mA cm−2, the Voc was 0.75 V, the FF was 67%, and the PCE of the DSSCs was 8.2%. Pure ZnS(QDs) have a reduced photovoltaic performance because of the structural constraints. In addition, when ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs are covered with rGO, the performance of the nanocomposite-based cell is significantly improved. In all measurements, the Voc of the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs and the ZnS@rGO nanocomposite were also improved except for the bare ZnS(QDs), in-fact the greater Voc is due to the higher interfacial active sites and the broader proton application of the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO material. Also, the increased efficiency can be attributed to the introduction of the GO in the nanocomposite materials because the GO has exceptional properties such as a high Fermi velocity and a greater electrical mobility. Thus, the synergistic impact of the nanocomposite ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs with rGO can improve the contact region between the electrolyte and the electrode interface. Therefore, further surface reaction sites will be established to enrich the photovoltaic performance.87

As the results of the experiment show, the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO based cells were larger (Jsc) when a reference electrode was used in contrast to the Pt. Thus, the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO composite has been confirmed as having an enhanced electrolytic activity to redox pairs and a superior electrical conductivity towards (I3−/I−), as indicated in Table 3. This shows that cells based on ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO have enormous electrical conductivity to support the electron translocation, and also a significant electrocatalytic activity to decrease the triiodide to iodide. In the meantime, the PCE and Jsc of the ZnS(QDs), ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs and ZnS@rGO composite cells also tend to have a deficit as compared to the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO based cell, which proved that the electrical conductivity is reduced compared to the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO based cell. The enhanced performance of the materials can be ascribed to many reasons. Notably, ZnS has tiny particles that amplify the connection area between the ZnS and the electrolyte. With the limitation of the diffusion lengths for the ions and polar bonds, the catalytic suitability was improved as well. Consequently, the N.f-MWCNTs and rGO are introduced to enhance the capability of the exchange current between the ZnS(QDs) and the electrolyte, which speed up the charge transfer at the CE/electrolyte interface. Therefore, the electrocatalytic activity, charge transfer, and the mutual interaction of electrodes and electrolyte can be seen in Scheme 2.88 There was also a reduced Jsc for the ZnS(QDs), ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs, and ZnS@rGO based cells compared to ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO, which confirmed the low electrical conductivity compared with ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO. The results showed that ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO improved the PCE efficiency of the CE-based hybrid materials. The continuous performance enhancement of the PCE can be accredited for many reasons.
The present ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO hybrid exhibits quite a high PCE (9.4%). This is summarized in a detailed comparison table that can be found in the ESI,† the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO shows a much higher PCE when compared with many well-known material systems such as MoS2/CNT,46 MWCNTs/PPy,89 graphene/carbon,90 NCNT–Co,61 3% Ag-doped CoS,91 Ni0.95Mo0.05S,47 CNTs,19 and so forth.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have examined the synergistic impact of carbon-based counter electrodes on DSSCs. ZnS(QDs) have been successfully fabricated for the first time using a hydrothermal method, with N-doped MWCNTs encapsulated with rGO. The synergistic effects, from EIS, Tafel polarization, CV, and J–V studies, have been evaluated. In addition, the N.f-MWCNTs in rGO significantly strengthened the electrocatalytic activity of ZnS(QDs), which can offer a rapid transport media for electrons and decrease the Rct of the CEs in DSSCs. The composite-based CE (ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO) has a PCE of 9.4%, greater than conventional Pt-based CEs and offers more stable catalytic activities in CV tests. Therefore, further optimization and reliable photovoltaic cell manufacturing of the hybrid counter electrode based on MWCNTs will help to increase the PCE levels. In particular, the approach presented provides a sensible method for the design of versatile, cost-effective electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity.
