    , Accepted 20th April 2021First published on 20th April 2021AbstractNanocrystalline tin (IV) oxide (SnO2) electron-transport layers (ETL) have shown great potential for achieving highly efficient, stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs), in particular low-temperature-processed flexible PSCs. Recently, studies have further shown that a modified SnO2 bottom layer facilitates the deposition of highly crystalline perovskite films, boosting the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs. The modulation of perovskite crystallization processes is a key to obtain highly crystalline and stable perovskite films; however, a fundamental understanding is still missing. Herein, we report an in situ synchrotron-based two-dimensional grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction technique to explore the SnO2 ETL-modulated perovskite crystallization kinetics for the first time. The titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx)-MXene quantum dot-modified SnO2 (MQDs-SnO2) ETL was found to be able to rapidly induce perovskite nucleation from the precursor solution, forming an intermediate perovskite phase upon anti-solvent treatment. This substantially improves the crystal quality and phase stability of the as-fabricated perovskite film. Benefiting in addition from the superior charge extraction properties of the MQDs-SnO2 layer, a steady-state power conversion efficiency of up to 23.3%, as well as outstanding stability against humidity and light soaking was achieved for the corresponding PSCs.

Broader context
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a cutting-edge photovoltaic technique to replace the current established technologies for effective use of solar energy. PSCs with good stability against humidity, heat and light are of significant importance for promoting their commercialization. It is well known that the bottom interface plays a critical role in the crystallization of the perovskite layer and, therefore, the performance of PSCs. A good crystallinity and a low defect density of the perovskite films are the key factors for achieving high-performance PSCs. However, a detailed exploration of the crystallization kinetics of the perovskite layer modulated by the bottom interface is still lacking. In this work, we demonstrated a clear picture of the advanced crystallization process of the perovskite from the nucleation, intermediate phase to the final crystalline perovskite films induced by the titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx)-MXene quantum dot-modified SnO2 electron transport layer. The resulting PSCs showed a steady-state power conversion efficiency of up to 23.3% and an outstanding stability.

Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a cutting-edge photovoltaic technique with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 25% and operational stability over thousands of hours, which endow them with great potential for commercialization.1–4 Most of the reported high-efficiency PSCs are based on a mesoporous TiO2 layer; however, the high sintering temperature (>450 °C) of mesoporous TiO2 limits its potential applications in large-scale and flexible solar cell devices.5 In contrast, low-temperature-processed nanocrystalline SnO2 has been demonstrated as an excellent electron extraction layer, gaining intense research interest. Remarkable efforts in terms of the device architecture, perovskite precursor composition and selective extraction layers have been devoted to improving the photovoltaic performance of SnO2-based PSCs.5–16
The low-temperature-processed SnO2 electron-transport layer (ETL) has been widely investigated in n-i-p structured PSCs because of its high electron mobility as well as suitable band alignment with perovskite photo-absorbers.5–8 Hagfeldt et al. demonstrated for the first time highly efficient and hysteresis-free SnO2-based PSCs.5 You et al. further reported a PCE of 21.6% for SnO2-based PSCs by a sequential deposition method7 and, recently, a certified PCE of 23.3% using a surface passivation technique.8 Meanwhile, it has been demonstrated that modifications of the SnO2 bottom interlayer could significantly boost the performance of resulting PSCs. For instance, we reported a red-carbon quantum dot-modified SnO2 (RCQs-SnO2) ETL with a high electron mobility of 1.73 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was successfully used to boost the PCE of the corresponding PSCs up to 22.77%.12 Similarly, metal-doped SnO2 ETL has been demonstrated to be able to improve the device performance due to improved charge carrier mobility.15
We noticed that the perovskite films deposited on the RCQs-SnO2 ETL had a more uniform morphology as well as better crystallinity and stability than those of the perovskite films deposited on the pristine SnO2 ETL.12 In addition, a potassium,17 chloride18 or organic ligand-modified bottom interlayer19 could also improve the crystallinity of the top perovskite layer. It is well known that a good crystallinity and a low defect density of the perovskite films are key factors to achieve high-performance PSCs. Thus, it is of vital importance to understand the fundamentals of the SnO2 ETL-modulated crystallization kinetics during the perovskite deposition process. However, to the best of our knowledge, the exploration of the relationship between SnO2 surface functionalization and relevant crystallization kinetics of the top perovskite layer is rarely reported.
Recently, a class of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides and nitrides, MXenes, have been studied for the application of PSCs20,21 owing to their unique optoelectronic properties and tunable surface properties. Agresti et al.20 reported that MXenes with various termination groups could be used to tune the work function of the perovskite layer and TiO2 ETL. Yang et al.21 reported that the electron mobility and charge extraction of SnO2 could be improved by mixing it with MXenes, leading to an increased PCE of the corresponding PSCs. Inspired by the promising features of MXenes, we synthesized N, S, co-doped Ti3C2Tx quantum dots (MQDs) aiming to engineer the perovskite/SnO2 ETL interface.
To reveal the rationale of MQD-modified SnO2 (MQDs-SnO2) ETL-induced crystallization kinetics of the top perovskite layer, we performed an in situ synchrotron-based 2D-grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (2D-GIXRD) study on the crystallization kinetics of the perovskite film. Unlike the crystallization process on the SnO2 ETL without MQDs, we found an obviously modulated crystallization procedure of the perovskite layer deposited on the MQDs-SnO2 ETL. A largely increased nucleation rate of perovskite crystals during the initial spin-coating process was observed for perovskites on the MQDs-SnO2 substrate and an intermediate perovskite phase was formed after anti-solvent treatment, yielding high-quality perovskite crystals with preferred orientation during the annealing process, leading to improved photovoltaic performance and stability of the corresponding PSCs.
Results and discussion
Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the transmission electron microscopic (TEM) image of the synthesized MQDs, which are well dispersed on copper grids. The details of the synthesis of MQDs can be found in the ESI.† Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows the TEM images of the pristine SnO2 (Fig. S2a, ESI†) and MQDs-SnO2 (Fig. S2b, ESI†) nanocrystals deposited on copper grids. Both SnO2 and MQDs-SnO2 nanoparticles were well dispersed and no obvious changes of the lattice parameters could be observed. A photo image of the SnO2 and MQDs-SnO2 solutions is shown in Fig. S2c (ESI†). Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) elemental mapping of MQDs-SnO2 films, which reveals that the C, Sn and O elements were uniformly distributed in the selected area. Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows the scanning electron microscopic (SEM) and atomic force microscopic (AFM) images of spin-coated SnO2 and MQDs-SnO2 films. The MQDs-SnO2 film had a smoother and more uniform surface morphology than that of the reference SnO2 film. Fig. S5a (ESI†) shows a calculated electron mobility of ∼8.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the MQDs-SnO2 film, which is significantly higher than that of pristine SnO2 (∼9.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Fig. S5b (ESI†) demonstrates a higher conductivity of MQDs-SnO2 than that of pristine SnO2. Fig. S6 (ESI†) shows the GIXRD patterns of SnO2 films with and without MQDs. The dominate lattice plane of the pristine SnO2 film is (110), whereas the dominate lattice planes of the MQDs-SnO2 film are (110), (101) and (211), indicating the un-stabilized and high-active crystal planes emerged in MQDs-SnO2. Fig. S7 (ESI†) shows identical optical absorptions for both pristine SnO2 and MQDs-SnO2 films.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to investigate the interactions between SnO2 and MQDs. Fig. S8 (ESI†) shows the Sn 3d3/2 peaks at ∼486.50 and ∼495.05 eV for the pristine SnO2 film. The fact that the corresponding peaks shifted to lower positions at ∼485.99 and ∼494.41 eV for the MQDs-SnO2 film indicates an increased electron density around Sn atoms. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was performed to investigate the electronic structures of the SnO2 ETLs and the perovskite films. Fig. S9a (ESI†) shows an up-shift of the Fermi level from −4.39 eV for the control SnO2 ETL to −4.12 eV for the MQDs-SnO2 ETL. Fig. S9b (ESI†) shows the Fermi level of −4.22 eV for the perovskite film on SnO2 and −4.16 eV for the perovskite film on the MQDs-SnO2 ETL. Fig. S9c (ESI†) shows the improved band alignment between perovskite and SnO2 ETLs with MQD modifications, facilitating the electron extraction from perovskite to SnO2 ETLs.12,18,22
The perovskite films with a composition of FA0.9MA0.05Cs0.05PbI0.98Br0.02 were deposited on the top of the SnO2 ETLs by a one-step spin-coating method via antisolvent treatment. Details of the perovskite precursor preparation and deposition method can be found in the SM. Fig. 1A and B show the top-view SEM images of both SnO2-based perovskite (reference) and MQDs-SnO2-based perovskite (target) films. Both the SEM images present compact perovskite layers, while the target perovskite film show more uniform and larger grain sizes than the reference. Fig. S10 (ESI†) shows an average grain size of ∼850 nm for the MQDs-SnO2-modulated perovskite film, which is significantly larger than that (∼500 nm) of the reference sample. Fig. 1C shows the ultraviolet-visible absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the reference and target films. The target film showed enhanced absorption in the visible region compared to the reference film, which could be related to the improved crystallinity of the perovskite film on MQDs-SnO2 (see the following text). Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was applied to investigate the charge extraction from perovskite to SnO2/MQD-SnO2, as shown in Fig. 1D. The fitted lifetime of the target film (55.2 ns) is much shorter than that (100.5 ns) of the reference film, indicating a better charge extraction of the bottom MQDs-SnO2 ETL than the pristine SnO2 ETL. The 2D-GIXRD patterns of both the reference and target perovskite films (Fig. 1E and F) show similar diffraction rings and spotty patterns. Compared with the reference perovskite film, the target film shows much brighter scattered rings at q ≈ 10.0, 20.0 and 22.2 nm−1, indicating a better crystallinity and better out-of-plane orientations.

The azimuthally integrated 1D GIXRD spectra (Fig. 1G) derived from the 2D-GIXRD patterns (Fig. 1E and F) further showed that the target film had higher and sharper (110) diffraction peaks than those of the reference film. The narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peaks of the target film could be associated with its relatively large perovskite crystalline size, consistent with the SEM images shown in Fig. 1A and B.12,23–25Fig. 1H presents the radially integrated intensity plots along the (110) diffraction ring (q ≈ 10.0 nm−1) plotted as a function of the azimuth angle φ for both the reference and target perovskite films. The (110) planes of both films exhibited a multi-order preferential orientation at azimuth angles of 45°, 67.5° and 90°. The target perovskite film had a narrower FWHM for any of the above-mentioned azimuth angle than that of the reference film, indicating a much more ordered structure with a preferential crystal orientation.25 The azimuthally integrated 1D GIXRD prove that MQDs-SnO2 favors a multi-ordered preferential (110) orientation and crystallization of the deposited top perovskite layer.12,24,25
To explore the MQD-SnO2 ETL-induced crystallization kinetics of the perovskite film, in situ 2D-GIXRD measurements were performed from the spin-coating of the perovskite precursor solution on both pristine SnO2 and MQDs-SnO2 ETLs until calcination of the perovskite. Fig. 2A shows the schematic of the in situ GIXRD measurements during the spin-coating process of the perovskite film. Fig. 2B is a photo of the experimental setup used for this study. After dropping the perovskite precursor solution onto the SnO2 substrates, the 2D-GIXRD patterns were recorded every 0.5 s during the spin-coating process for 30 s. To simulate the real device fabrication condition, the whole spin-coating processes were performed in a customized mini glove box with controlled amount of water and oxygen levels (H2O and O2 < 1 ppm). Fig. 2C shows the 2D-GIXRD patterns of the perovskite films deposited on pristine SnO2 (a-d) and MQDs-SnO2 (e-h) ETLs as a function of the spin-coating time. Different from the perovskite film deposited on pristine SnO2, the perovskite film deposited on MQDs-SnO2 ETL showed bright diffraction rings and spots starting from 12 s, which indicated a rapid nucleation process during the spin-coating stage before anti-solvent treatment. Movies S1 and S2 (ESI†) display the evolution of 2D-GIXRD patterns during the whole spin-coating process.

Fig. 2D and E show the azimuthally integrated intensity plots derived from the 2D-GIXRD patterns of the perovskites fabricated on pristine SnO2 and MQDs-SnO2 ETLs, respectively. For the perovskite film grown on pristine SnO2 (Fig. 2D), there was no obvious peaks of perovskite phase but several broad bumps, indicating the amorphous nature of the perovskite precursor without any sign of conversion into perovskite crystals before the antisolvent treatment. This is also consistent with the previous report by Dounya Barrit et al. that a disordered colloidal state without a diffraction signature was observed for the initial spin-coating process.26 Differently, for the perovskite films grown on the MQD-SnO2 ETL, a few peaks could be clearly observed at ∼12 s of the spin-coating process. The peaks at q ≈ 7.0 nm−1 and q ≈ 8.5 nm−1 are assigned to perovskite intermediate phases,12,24,25,27 and the diffraction peak at q ≈ 10.0 nm−1 is known to be the tetragonal perovskite (110) phase. It is noted that all these diffraction peaks increased rapidly during the 12 to 15 s time region and then remained almost constant until 30 s, giving an appropriate time window for the subsequent antisolvent treatment. Similar but weaker diffraction patterns were also observed for the perovskite film deposited on our previously reported RCQs-SnO2 ETL, as shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†).12
After the anti-solvent treatment, the integrated 1D-GIXRD spectra of the reference and target perovskite films were recorded (presented in Fig. 2F). The small diffraction peaks at q ≈ 10.0 nm−1 for both films indicate a small amount of perovskite crystals formed right after the antisolvent treatment. Different from the control film, the target film had a new diffraction peak at q ≈ 8.5 nm−1, which is the dominating intermediate perovskite phase during the whole spin-coating period. It is well known to the PSC field that an intermediate phase is crucial for the final crystallization of the perovskite.27,28 Our results are consistent with the previous reports that quantum-dot materials including graphene oxides and RCQs could increase the nucleation rate of crystalline perovskite as well as the intermediate perovskite phase.11–14
We continued the in situ real-time 2D-GIXRD measurements during the subsequent annealing process to investigate the transformation from the intermediate phase to the final perovskite phase. The annealing process was carefully monitored: the temperature increased gradually from room temperature to 100 °C within the initial 2 minutes (stage I),and remained at 100 °C for the following 10 minutes (stage II), and then increased to 150 °C for 35 minutes (stage III). Fig. S12 (ESI†) shows the 2D-GIXRD patterns of the perovskite films annealed at five different time points. Fig. 3A and B show the azimuthally integrated intensity profiles derived from these 2D-GIXRD patterns, demonstrating a gradual structural evolution from distinct intermediate perovskite crystals into highly ordered perovskite crystals during the annealing process.
 Fig. 3  GIXRD measurements of the perovskite films during the annealing process. The integrated 1D-GIXRD spectra of reference (A) and target (B) perovskite films at different annealing time points; Diffraction intensity (peak area) of the reference (C) and target (D) perovskite films at different annealing time points; FWHM (E) and peak position (F) of the perovskite (110) diffraction peak of both reference and target perovskite films plotted as functions of annealing time. 

Fig. 3C shows the change in the perovskite peak intensity of the reference film with annealing time. For the perovskite intermediate phase (q ≈ 8.5 nm−1), it gradually decreased with the increase in annealing time and disappeared at 25 minutes, whereas the perovskite (110) phase (q ≈ 10.0 nm−1) increased till ∼20 min, and then decreased gradually in the last 10 min, indicating a poor thermal stability for the reference perovskite film. Fig. 3D shows the change in the perovskite peak intensity of the target film with annealing time. It showed a rapid conversion from the intermediate perovskite phase to the highly crystalline perovskite phase within 10 min at 100 °C and the perovskite phase remained almost constant at 150 °C for 15 min, indicating an improved thermal stability for the target perovskite film as compared to the reference.

Fig. 3E shows the FWHM of the perovskite (110) peaks of both the reference and target perovskite films. The FWHM of the target film was larger than that of the reference film during the whole annealing process, indicating bigger average size domain formation. For the target perovskite film, the FWHM of the perovskite (110) peak gradually decreased with the increase in the annealing time up to 20 minutes and then kept almost constant. Fig. 3F shows the perovskite (110) peak positions of both the reference and target perovskite films as a function of the annealing time. The fluctuation of the perovskite (110) diffraction peak of the target film during annealing was smaller than that of the control film. All these results indicated that the target film had a better crystallinity and thermal stability up to 150 °C than that of the reference film.
Real-time in situ GIXRD measurements were also performed for the films heated at 100 °C in an ambient environment with 40–60% relative humidity, and the results are shown in Fig. S13a–c (ESI†). The perovskite diffraction peak of the reference film decreased much faster than that of the target one, suggesting that the MQDs-SnO2 ETL is crucial for achieving the thermal and moisture resistant perovskite films. Fig. S14 (ESI†) shows the cross-sectional SEM images of perovskite/ETL interfaces. Compared with the interface between the perovskite and pristine SnO2 ETL, the morphology of the perovskite/MQDs-SnO2 ETL interface is shown to be smoother without obvious pinholes, indicating larger textured domains and inter-connected grain boundaries within the perovskite film grown on the MQDs-SnO2 ETL. We further performed cross-sectional TEM images to investigate the interface between perovskite and SnO2 ETLs, as shown in Fig. S15 (ESI†). Compared with the perovskite/SnO2 interface (Fig. S15a and b, ESI†), the perovskite/MQD-SnO2 interface is smoother and much more uniform (Fig. S15c and d, ESI†). Importantly, a lot of obvious lattice fringes could be observed for the perovskite films on MQDs-SnO2 (Fig. S15d, ESI†), indicating an enhanced crystallinity of the perovskite film, which is consistent with the GIXRD measurements shown in Fig. 1G.
We then fabricated PSC devices using an ITO/SnO2/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD/MoO3/Au (ITO, indium tin oxide; spiro-MeOTAD, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-bis(p-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene; MoO3, molybdenum oxide) configuration, as illustrated in Fig. 4A. Fig. 4B shows a PCE of 20.96% with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 24.26 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.140 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.758 for the reference device. The champion target device achieved a maximum PCE of 23.34% with a Jsc of 24.96 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.172 V, and a FF of 0.798. The detailed J–V parameters for the optimization of MQDs-SnO2 are summarized in the SM (Fig. S16, S17 and Tables S1, S2, ESI†). We note that no obvious hysteresis could be found for the target device between forward and reverse scan, which could be related to the superior electron extraction and transport properties of MQDs-SnO2.29–32Fig. 4C shows the stabilized PCE at a constant voltage bias of 0.957 V and 1.013 V, which is the voltage under maximum power point (MPP) output of the reference and target PSCs, respectively. Compared with the control device, the steady power output of the target cell reached up to ∼23% and stabilized for 500 s at a bias voltage of 1.013 V, confirming the enhanced PCE of PSCs induced by MQD modification. Fig. 4D shows the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) and the integrated current density (Jsc) for both the reference and target PSCs. Compared with the reference device, the target device had a higher IPCE over the entire visible light region with an integrated Jsc value up to ∼24.39 mA cm−2, which agrees well with the measured Jsc value of ∼24.96 mA cm−2 under a solar simulator. Table S3 (ESI†) shows the photovoltaic parameters of the best PSCs fabricated on bare SnO2, RCQs-SnO2, and MQDs-SnO2 ETLs. Clearly, the MQDs-SnO2-based device showed the best performance demonstrating the advantage of treating the colloidal SnO2 particles via MQD modulation.

(E) long-term light-exposition stability of the reference and target PSCs without encapsulation; (F) PCE of the reference and target PSCs without encapsulation as a function of exposure time in an ambient environment with 40% RH at 25 °C. 

Fig. 4E shows the light soaking stability of the PSC devices under simulated one-sun illumination, which proves that the target PSCs are much more resistant to light stress than the control device without MQDs. There are less than 10% efficiency losses after 500 h continuous simulated one-sun illumination for target PSCs, whereas the measured PCEs presented over 20% losses for the control PSCs under the same conditions. Fig. 4F shows the shelf stability of the un-encapsulated PSC devices stored in an ambient environment with 40–60% RH at 25 °C. The PCE of the target cell remained at ∼90% of its initial value after 500-hour storage, whereas the reference PSC decreased down to ∼80% of its initial value. Fig. S18 (ESI†) shows the thermal stability test of the control and target PSCs by annealing them at 60 °C for 120 hours. The normalized PCEs of both devices without encapsulation are plotted as a function of the exposure time in an ambient environment with ∼25% relative humidity at 60 °C. Notably, the PCE of the MQD-SnO2-based PSC dropped much less compared with the reference cell, demonstrating that the novel MQDs-SnO2 ETL enhances the thermal stability of planar PSCs significantly over those based on a pristine SnO2 ETL. These stability tests indicated that perovskite films grown on the MQDs-SnO2 ETL were more robust against the erosion of light, moisture, heat, and oxygen.
Conclusion
In summary, we herein reported highly efficient and stable PSCs employing a MQD-modified nanocrystalline SnO2 ETL. Synchrotron-based in situ 2D-GIXRD measurements were performed during the perovskite deposition process to investigate the bottom SnO2 ETL-induced crystallization kinetics of the perovskite film. It was found that MQDs-SnO2 ETL-modulated crystallization was crucial for the performance and stability of the resulting PSCs. The in-depth study of the crystallization process from the nucleation and intermediate phase to the calcined perovskite phase provides an effective approach for fabricating high-quality perovskite films on a planar ETL. Our work provides a general methodology for understanding the perovskite crystallization, which is considered as one of the most important research topics in the perovskite community.

Broader context
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a cutting-edge photovoltaic technique to replace the current established technologies for effective use of solar energy. PSCs with good stability against humidity, heat and light are of significant importance for promoting their commercialization. It is well known that the bottom interface plays a critical role in the crystallization of the perovskite layer and, therefore, the performance of PSCs. A good crystallinity and a low defect density of the perovskite films are the key factors for achieving high-performance PSCs. However, a detailed exploration of the crystallization kinetics of the perovskite layer modulated by the bottom interface is still lacking. In this work, we demonstrated a clear picture of the advanced crystallization process of the perovskite from the nucleation, intermediate phase to the final crystalline perovskite films induced by the titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx)-MXene quantum dot-modified SnO2 electron transport layer. The resulting PSCs showed a steady-state power conversion efficiency of up to 23.3% and an outstanding stability.
