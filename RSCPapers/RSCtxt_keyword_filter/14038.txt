However, the formation and growth mechanism of SnS2 is incomplete and the common etching treatment with (NH4)2S is problematic because of its toxic characteristics. In this study, the formation and growth of large-size SnS2 sheets were observed to occur on the surface of the CZTS thin film via condensation during the cooling process. Sequently, a novel and benign peeling process was carried out using a sticky tape to effectively remove the SnS2 formed on the surface, resulting in a uniform CZTS thin film. A maximum efficiency of 4.3% of the oxides-derived CZTS device was obtained after this mechanical exfoliation, which is nearly eleven times that of the device without stripping. It was confirmed that this surface treatment is an effective and green way to remove the SnS2 impurity, which largely improved the performance of the CZTS device and may guide the preparation of pure phase CZTS thin films.
1. Introduction
For the development of an eco-friendly and sustainable world, solar energy, as a typical clean-energy source, plays an important role in future energy generation. Considering that the ingredients of Cu2ZnSnS4 are all low-cost, non-toxic and abundant, CZTS is a potentially promising absorber material. Although superior efficiencies of 12.7% for Cu2ZnSnSxSe4 (CZTSSe)1 and 9.2% for CZTS2 have been achieved since the photovoltaic effect in CZTS was first reported in 1988,3 the performance of CZTS-based solar cells is far behind that of its theoretical power conversion efficiency (PCE) (32.2%)4 and that of the Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe) device (22.6%).5 One of the major challenges in preparing high-efficiency CZTS devices is to develop impurity-free and phase-controlled CZTS thin films. However, the narrow single-phase existence zone in the phase diagram causes the facile formation of defects and secondaries during the entire growth and annealing process.6,7 Moreover, a Cu-poor and Zn-rich composition is regarded as essential for high performance devices because of its ability to reduce deep level defects in CZTS.7–9 This non-stoichiometric composition squeezes the phase stable region of CZTS to nearly a point, which makes secondary phases almost impossible to avoid.10–12
The precipitate-secondary-phases in the CZTS thin films include ZnS, CuxS, SnS, SnS2 and Cu2SnS3. These impurities may exist at the Mo/CZTS interface in the bulk as well as the surface of CZTS thin films. Due to their intrinsic properties, the detrimental effects of secondary phases on CZTS devices are different (see Table 1). Among these secondary phases, the existence of SnS2 on the surface of CZTS films is fatal for device performance, which will pull down the Voc of the devices by forming a diode and barrier for carrier collection. It is reported that a SnS2 secondary phase can form on the surface, which may be caused by stoichiometric deviation or by condensation.13 Although the previous studies have reported the formation of the SnS2 impurity in the annealed CZTS thin films, the formation and growth mechanism of SnS2 remains unclear. Hence, further studies are required to obtain a better understanding of the SnS2 secondary phase. Moreover, various methods have emerged that are directed against the impurities to minimize the harmful effects on CZTS solar cells brought by secondary phases (Table 1). Currently, chemical etching is considered as a common tool to remove impurities and enhance device performance. Even though a significant number of approaches for the removal of CZTS impurities have emerged, methods for the removal of SnS2 are far less diversified. The barely reported feasible etchant for the removal of SnS2 is (NH4)2S, which is not an ideal choice because it is corrosive, toxic and flammable. Therefore, it is vital to develop a facile and green removal method for SnS2 and to decipher the formation mechanism of SnS2.

In this study, a series of cooling routs were designed to study the formation and growth mechanism of SnS2 during the cooling process. A novel and effective method (mechanical exfoliation) was used to remove the harmful-phase SnS2 without using any wet-chemical solution. After mechanical exfoliation, secondary-phase SnS2 can be practically removed with little damage to the absorber, which enhanced the PCE of the oxides-derived CZTS device from 0.38% to 4.3%. Moreover, the effects of mechanical exfoliation on the performance of the CZTS device were also carefully investigated.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Preparation of CZTS thin films from oxides precursor and sulfurization process
All chemical reagents were of analytical grade and were used without further purification. First, the oxide nanoparticles were synthesized by baking a mixture of cupric nitrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, purity > 99.5%), zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, purity > 99.5%), tin(II) oxalate (SnC2O4, purity > 98%) and ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3, purity > 98%) in a muffle furnace at 380 °C for 30 min according to composition ratios of Cu/(Zn + Sn) = 0.8 and Zn/Sn = 1.2. It should be noted that the abovementioned mixture is ground for at least 30 min until no bubble generation was observed (more details can be found in our previous study21). Then, the oxide-slurry (200 mg mL−1) was prepared by dispersing oxide-nanoparticles in ethanol solvent through ball milling. Then, the CZTS oxide precursor films were obtained by depositing the prepared oxide slurry on Mo-coated soda-lime glass substrate through the doctor blade method. To prepare CZTS absorbers, the as-prepared oxide precursor films were sulfurized at 580 °C for 30 min. In this part, the samples were sulfurized in the furnace with a quasi-closed quartz crucible (vacuum state ∼10−1 Pa). The sulfurization crucible was placed in a furnace tubule under Ar (∼0.05 MPa). Instead of toxic hydrogen sulfide gas, low toxic solid sulfur powder (0.04 g) was applied to act as a sulfur source in the suflurization and the heating rate was kept at 45 °C min−1.
To study the formation and growth of SnS2, a cooling control strategy was carried out. After the sulfurization at 580 °C was completed, the samples were naturally cooled for a certain time (i.e., A: 0 min; B: 30 min; C: 60 min; D: 90 min; E: 200 min (also denoted as natural cooling)) and then the furnace was immediately opened to allow the samples to rapidly cool to room temperature. The detailed temperature profile is shown in the Fig. 1(F). In addition, the sulfur pressure of each point was calculated to be 5.6 × 105 Pa for A, 6.4 × 104 Pa for B, 7.1 × 103 Pa for C, 7.0 × 102 Pa for D and 1 × 10−1 Pa for E.

2.2 Mechanical exfoliation treatment
To remove the secondary phase SnS2 from the CZTS absorber, a sticky tape (peeling force is around 26 N/25 mm, KAPTON TAPE) was used to peel off the SnS2 from the surface of the CZTS absorber (sample E), which was obtained from natural cooling (the whole process can be seen in Fig. S1†). The tape is one of the conductive adhesive tapes or non-degumming adhesive tapes. In the following sections, ME and W/OME are used to represent the sample with and without mechanical exfoliation treatment, respectively.
2.3 Fabrication of CZTS solar cell device
After sulfurization of CZTS at 580 °C and natural cooling, the devices based on the CZTS thin films with and without mechanical exfoliation treatment were both assembled with the structure of SLG/Mo/CZTS/CdS/i-ZnO/AZO without any anti-reflection layer. First, an ∼80 nm CdS buffer layer was grown by chemical bath deposition (CBD) from a mixed solution of 25 mL CdSO4 (15 mM), 12.5 mL thiourea (1.5 M) and 32.6 mL ammonia (25–28%) at 65 °C for 12 min. Following this, the coated films were rinsed thoroughly with deionized water and then blow-dried. Second, a ∼50 nm i-ZnO layer and a ∼500 nm AZO layer were deposited by radio-frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering under process parameters of 10−4 Pa/80 W/20 min and 10−4 Pa/120 W/2.5 h, respectively. Finally, a ∼200 nm Ag collection grid was deposited via thermal evaporation under 10−3 Pa.
2.4 Characterizations
The lattice structures of the thin films were recognized by the XRD method (D/Max-rA). The morphology and elemental distributions of the films were observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, SU-8010) with an attached energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyzer (OCTANE PLUS). Raman measurements were performed at room temperature with a LABRAM-HR micro-Raman system with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. Then, the solar cells were characterized using a Keithly 4200-SCS semiconductor characterization system equipped with an AAASAN-EI ELECTRIC Solar Simulator (XES-40S1) and the impedance spectra were measured by a Zennium (Zahner) electrochemical workstation at a bias voltage of 0.4 V in the dark. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices was performed on a solar cell quantum efficiency measurement system (Model QEX10).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 The formation and growth mechanism of SnS2
A previous study has found that SnS2 preferably forms on the surface of CZTS films, which may severely destroy the p–n junction and deteriorate the performance of the CZTS device.22 Unfortunately, little information is currently available concerning the formation and growth mechanism of secondary phase SnS2. Hence, a series of experiments based on different cooling routes were carried out to clarify the formation and growth mechanism of SnS2 as shown in Fig. 1(F). SEM was used to examine the morphology of the resultant CZTS thin films Fig. 1(A)–(E). It is easy to observe that the quantity and crystallinity of the sheet-like impurities gradually improved during the natural cooling process. The growth of such secondary phase is saturated when the cooling process continued for 90 min (C sample), leading to the formation of a hexagonal sheet with a lateral size of 30–40 μm. To identify the impurity phase, Raman measurements were performed. The Raman spectra revealed that the sheet-like objects that formed on the surface of the CZTS film during the cooling process are SnS2, as shown in Fig. 1(A)–(E), which is confirmed by a characteristic peak at ∼317 cm−1 assigned to the A1g vertical-plane vibrational phonon mode of SnS2.23 Moreover, the sheet-like SnS2 can be suppressed when an ultra-rapid cooling route is adopted; however, some cracks are observed on the surface of the CZTS thin films (as shown in Fig. S2†), which may subsequently cause a short-circuit in the CZTS device. Therefore, though the ultra-rapid cooling route can effectively suppress the formation of sheet-like SnS2, it may cause a short-circuit problem and the natural cooling route may be an ideal approach once the sheet-like impurities can be effectively removed.
The observed detrimental SnS2 on the surface of the CZTS thin film is expected to emerge either from bulk or from the sulfurization ambient. Bolke et al. assumed that secondary phase SnS2 would form on the surface either because of stoichiometric deviation or by condensation.13 The above analysis in this study confirmed that the secondary-phase SnS2 on the surface is more likely to be formed due to the condensation of the Sn source from the environment during the cooling process. It is well known that the Sn element is easily lost in the form of SnS vapor at conventional sulfurization temperatures,24,25 which tend to be re-oxidized into solid SnS2 (also called as condensation).26 To verify the formation mechanism of SnS2, a curve of Gibbs free energy (ΔGSnS–S) in the temperature range of 300–1000 K was plotted (as shown in Fig. S3†), which demonstrated that SnS can react with S2 spontaneously during the entire cooling process. According to the abovementioned analysis, SnS gas in the quasi-closed quartz crucible is easily re-oxidized into solid SnS2.26 Moreover, the generation of SnS has been widely reported. For example, Ren et al. have investigated that SnS tends to segregate at both sides of annealed CZTS films with a Cu-poor and Zn-rich composition.27 Redinger et al. have reported that the CZTS will decompose into Cu2S, ZnS, SnS and S2 at the surface during annealing.28 J. J. Scragg et al. have also proposed that CZTS may react with the Mo contact, generating Cu2S, ZnS, SnS and MoS2, because the Gibbs free energy (ΔG) of this reaction is −150 kJ under 550 °C,26,29 which can promote the formation of SnS2 by increasing SnS vapor. In addition, another possible route for generating SnS vapor is the decomposition of SnS2 at high temperature.29 From the possible reaction mentioned above, SnS may vaporize through various routes and re-oxidize to SnS2 under high sulfur partial pressure. In this study, the size of SnS2 was observed to gradually increase until saturation as the cooling process was going on. This is because the sulfur pressure will be reduced at lower temperatures, but will remain high (above 103 Pa) until 250 °C.30 Therefore, it can be concluded from the above experimental and theoretical results that the secondary phase SnS2 will gradually form on the surface of the CZTS thin film via condensation of the Sn source during the cooling process.
3.2 Mechanical exfoliation treatment
It is known that the large sheet-like SnS2 (around 30–40 μm) may significantly degrade device performance. Thus far, the removal of SnS2 is almost based on chemical solution etching, which is not an ideal removal method in industrial production. In this study, we introduce a promising method, mechanical exfoliation, to eliminate the detrimental effects brought by SnS2 impurities. As shown in Fig. S1,† a sticky tape is applied to remove the SnS2 phase (golden objects) from the sample that is coolled naturally (sample E) during mechanical exfoliation. It was observed that the glistening objects on the surface of the films can be transferred to the surface of the tape. To check the effects of mechanical exfoliation on the CZTS thin films, a series of tests and analyses were carried out.

Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the ME sample and W/O ME sample. Regardless of the strong diffraction peak at 40°, which is related with the (110) plane of Mo (JCPDS no. 42-1120), both patterns showed diffraction peaks at 28.3°, 47.3° and 56.2°, corresponding to the (112), (220) and (312) planes of the kesterite CZTS phase (JCPDS no. 26-0575),31 respectively. Compared to the ME sample (the green one), the pattern of the W/O ME sample (the purple one) has additional peaks at 15°, 32.1°, 36.4° and 41.9° (marked with red diamonds in Fig. 2). After referring to the standard PDF card (JCPDS no. 21-1231), these peaks are demonstrated in accordance with the (002), (102), (103) and (104) planes of SnS2, respectively. It suggested that SnS2 phases exist on the W/O ME sample, which can be removed with mechanical exfoliation.
 Fig. 2  XRD patterns of the W/O ME sample and the ME sample. 
To detect small residual impurities, a Raman test was conducted to help justify the possible SnS2 that may remain in the CZTS films. Fig. 3 shows the Raman spectra of the W/O ME sample (purple spectra) and ME sample (green spectra). The peaks at 285 cm−1 and 333 cm−1 are associated with the A1 vibration mode of the CZTS phase.32–34 The peak at 317 cm−1 that appeared in the W/O ME sample corresponds to the SnS2 phase.35 From the abovementioned analysis, we can conclude that the secondary phase SnS2 can be nearly removed from the surface of the CZTS thin films by mechanical exfoliation.
 Fig. 3  Raman spectroscopy of the W/O ME sample and the ME sample. 
The plan-view SEM image and EDX mapping of the CZTS thin films and sticky tape with SnS2 are shown in Fig. 4. There are many sheet-like SnS2 on the surface of the W/O ME sample (Fig. 4(a-1)). The size of the largest sheet-like SnS2 is over 40 μm, which is far beyond the thickness of the CZTS film, which may cause the short circuit problem of the CZTS devices. To further identify SnS2, EDX mapping was introduced to analyze the distribution of Cu, Zn, Sn and S elements (as shown in Fig. 4(a-3)). It is clear that the Sn and S elements are rich in the zone of the sheet-like object that exists in the scanning area, while Zn and Cu elements are hardly detected in this area (black area indicates no presence of the element). This confirmed the formation of sheet-like SnS2 on the surface of the CZTS thin films. When the sample is treated by mechanical exfoliation, the sheet-like SnS2 phase that exists on the surface of the CZTS films is thoroughly removed (as shown in Fig. 4(b-1)). The EDX mapping of the former scanning area of Fig. 4(a-2) shows a homogeneous distribution of Cu, Zn, Sn and S (as shown in Fig. 4(b-3)). This result indicates that SnS2 was totally removed and the CZTS thin film, after mechanical exfoliation, is uniform. Moreover, the cross-sectional SEM image of the CZTS thin films before and after ME treatment shows that the sheet-like SnS2 can insert into the surface shallowly as shown in Fig. S4.† It can be observed that the sheet-like SnS2 tends to exist on the surface of the CZTS films and does not insert into the bulk absorber layer. This may result in the co-growth of CZTS grains and the sheet-like SnS2. Thus, when the cooling process is completed, the grown-part of CZTS during the formation of SnS2 can wrap the root of the sheet-like SnS2. In addition, Fig. 4(c) demonstrates that the sheet can be effectively transferred to tape from the surface of the CZTS thin film. The EDX mapping of the sheet on the tape again confirms that the sheet-like object is the SnS2 phase as shown in Fig. 4(c-3). Moreover, there are no other objects on the surface of the tape except sheet-like SnS2, which suggests that mechanical exfoliation does negligible damage to the surface structure of the CZTS film as compared to the wet chemical route. Noting that the composition ratios of Cu/(Zn + Sn) and Zn/Sn highly affect the device performance by primarily controlling shallow acceptors (CuZn),7 a scanning region with an area of 0.04 square millimetre was tested by EDX (as shown in Fig. S5†). The result shows that the composition ratios of Cu/(Zn + Sn) = 0.9 and Zn/Sn = 1.26 for the ME sample and the composition ratios of Cu/(Zn + Sn) = 0.89 and Zn/Sn = 1.29 for the W/O ME sample all fall in the suitable range for a highly efficient CZTS device.36 Thus, mechanical exfoliation is proven to be a powerful tool to thoroughly remove SnS2, which is in agreement with the XRD and Raman results.

Based on the above results, the formation and removal of secondary phase SnS2 can be described as shown in Fig. 5. Originally, the large size SnS2 sheet forms on the surface of the CZTS film by condensation during the natural cooling process after high temperature sulfurization. Then, a sticky tape is used to remove the SnS2 phase from the surface of the CZTS film. Finally, a uniform CZTS absorber film is obtained by applying a facile mechanical exfoliation.

3.3 Effects of large sheet-like SnS2 and mechanical exfoliation on the performance of CZTS devices
To further investigate the role of SnS2 on the optoelectronic properties of a CZTS solar cell and the benefits of doping mechanical exfoliation, two different CZTS solar cells were prepared using the W/O ME sample and the ME sample. The J–V curves for the devices were tested (Fig. 6(a)). It can be clearly observed that solar cells derived from the W/O ME samples show poor performance compared to that of the ME samples, which exhibits a conversion efficiency (η) of 0.38% for the W/O ME sample and 4.3% for the ME sample, respectively. The visible improvement in the power conversion efficiency of the ME sample is due to the increase in open voltage (Voc), short current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) (as shown in Table 2). To quantify the effects of SnS2, statistical data of the performance metrics from 15 devices before and after the ME treatment are shown in Fig. 7. There is a strong correlation between device performance and the SnS2 secondary phase. As expected, substantial Voc, Jsc and FF enhancement is observed for all ME devices. The average PCE increased from 0.5% to 4.3% after ME treatment. Though the device performance can be largely improved after applying ME, the observed device efficiency is still lower than that of the reported efficiency. Further optimization of device fabrication is needed. The EQE measurement was further executed to reveal the role of ME treatment. As shown in Fig. 6(b), the EQE loss below 516 nm is due to CdS and ZnO absorption. The low EQE response (500–800 nm) for the W/O ME device was observed due to the fact that the large SnS2 increased the defect density and thus the rate of recombination in the device. After ME treatment, the EQE value of the ME device shows a significant increase compared to the W/O ME device, which is consistent with the improvement of the p–n junction. Furthermore, from the EQE curves, the band gap (Eg) value was calculated by linear extrapolation of (E × ln(1 − EQE))2versus E (as shown in Fig. 6(c)). The band gap of the ME sample and the W/O ME sample are estimated to be 1.41 eV and 1.43 eV respectively, which may be caused by the high band gap of SnS2 (∼2.1 eV).37,38 Therefore, from the IV and EQE analysis, it was found that the existence of SnS2 sheets on the CZTS surface may largely pull down the PCE of the CZTS devices and the mechanical exfoliation can effectively weaken the damages brought by SnS2.

The visible improvement in device performance after ME treatment can be interpreted by the fact that the large-size SnS2 sheet, present on the surface of CZTS thin film, impedes the preparation of a p–n (CZTS/CdS) junction with a good rectifying behavior, which may be proposed as follows. First, SnS2 is an intrinsic n-type material with a band gap of 2.1 eV; it can form a p–n junction with CZTS.39 However, the large lattice mismatch between hexagonal SnS2 and tetragonal CZTS will form incoherent interfaces with high recombination velocities. Second, band offset is considered as another influential factor of the electronic transport behavior of the heterojunction interface. Although the band gap value of SnS2 is close to that of CdS, the conduction band offset (CBO) between SnS2 and CZTS (ΔEC = −0.66 eV) is more negative than that of CdS and CZTS (ΔEC = −0.27 eV) as shown in Fig. 8. It is reported that “cliff-like” CBO is equivalent to an interface bandgap reduction, which will enhance recombination, particularly between electrons in the conduction band of the buffer and holes in the valence band.40 Thus, the overly large negative CBO between SnS2 and CZTS will give rise to severe recombination at the interfaces. Third, the resistivity of the secondary phase SnS2 is even higher than that of ZnS. Thus, it is likely to be electrically inactive in the device, which can form a barrier for carrier collection and decrease the Jsc.39,41 In addition, Ren et al. reported that the formation of the SnS phase on CZTS is known to result in poor contact resistance at the interface, which leads to the formation of a dead area that reduces the Jsc of the solar cells.27 Finally, the large-size SnS2 sheet will deteriorate the structure of the CZTS device as shown in the cross-sectional SEM micrographs of the device (Fig. 9). For the W/O ME device, the large-size sheet-like SnS2 (about 40 μm) will impale the entire device as evidenced by the surface outcrop of the SnS2 sheets. The other convincing evidence is that the large SnS2 sheet bends with ZnO/AZO during the deposition of window layers and leaving a hollow area in the device (as shown in Fig. 9(c)). Thus, irrespective of whether the sheet-like SnS2 is bent, it will break the structure of the device along its edge and cause severe recombination. Adversely, if the sheet-like SnS2 bends, the root of the sheet-like SnS2 may pull up the CZTS around the interface of SnS2/CZTS, which will cause a device shunt problem. Thus, the above analysis confirmed that the existing SnS2 on the surface of the CZTS thin films will cause severe recombination and deteriorated carrier collection (just like a barrier), which is different from the influence mechanism of CuS reported in another study. It is known that the Cu-rich composition is liable to generate a CuS secondary phase. Larsen et al. considered that the highly conductive CuS tunnel would enhance recombination in bulk and at the interface.42 Moreover, high concentrations of defect clusters in Cu-rich composition may also increase recombination as well as decrease Voc and efficiency. Similarly, the high rate of recombination caused by SnS2 may decrease Voc, FF and EQE for the W/O MW device. In contrast, the surface of the ME sample is smoother than that of the W/O ME sample, which is a key factor for achieving a high-performance device as shown in Fig. 9(b) and (d). Thus, the recombination at the interfaces will drastically decrease by removing the secondary phase SnS2 using ME treatment, resulting in the improvement of leakage conduction, open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF).

To further investigate the charge transport and recombination at the hetero-structural interface in the as-prepared CZTS devices before and after mechanical exfoliation treatment, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured at a bias voltage of 0.4 V in the dark (Fig. 10). Fig. 10(a) and (b) show the Nyquist plots of the W/O ME device and the ME device. The inset in both Fig. 10(a) and (b) show the equivalent electronic circuit, which is employed to fit the impedance spectra. The Rrec is the recombination resistance, which is inversely proportional to the charge recombination rate of the device. The fitted Rrec values are 279.6 and 1.36 × 104 Ω for the W/O ME device and ME device, respectively, indicating that the removal of SnS2 is beneficial for suppressing the charge recombination. To further confirm this result, the J–V response in the dark was also measured (Fig. S7†). The distinct decrease in the dark current of the ME device reveals that the current leakage in the W/O ME device is more severe than that of the ME device. This observation again suggests that the recombination is decreased after ME treatment, which is in line with the EIS measurement. In this case, the smooth and SnS2-free CZTS thin films contributed to the formation of an ideal p–n junction, which was also proven by the decrease of ideality factor (n), diode current (J0) and Rsh after ME treatment from the J–V measurement (Table 2). The detailed performance metrics of the CZTS device are extracted from the J–V data according to the Sites' method43 (please see Fig. S7†). Therefore, mechanical exfoliation treatment is proven to be a feasible method for the removal of SnS2 and can significantly improve device performance. In addition, mechanical exfoliation treatment also succeeded in removing secondary phase CuS from the surface of Cu-rich CZTS (Cu/(Zn + Sn) = 1.1, Zn/Sn = 1.1) films, as reported in another study (Fig. S8†), which indicates that this green and facile route may be a promising approach that can be expanded to remove other large-size secondary phases.

4. Conclusion
In summary, the time-dependent cooling process revealed that the secondary-phase SnS2 may form on the surface of a CZTS thin film via condensation, which is decisively verified through the observation of formation and growth of SnS2. Then, a novel and green mechanical exfoliation method was applied to effectively remove the large-size SnS2 sheet from the surface of the CZTS thin films without destroying the films, thus avoiding the use of toxic etchants. Finally, devices with SnS2, followed by mechanical exfoliation, can exhibit enhanced efficiency from 0.38% up to 4.3%, which is attributed to the improved morphology, reduced recombination and the enhanced quality of the p–n junction. Hence, such a facile mechanical exfoliation is a promising method to remove SnS2 from CZTS films and raise the PCE of the CZTS solar cell. If this mechanical exfoliation method is properly extended, it will be also suitable for other ternary or quaternary absorber layers.
