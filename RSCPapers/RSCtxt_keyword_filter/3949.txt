    , Accepted 22nd June 2014First published on 25th June 2014AbstractAdvanced electrodes with a high energy density at high power are urgently needed for high-performance energy storage devices, including lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and supercapacitors (SCs), to fulfil the requirements of future electrochemical power sources for applications such as in hybrid electric/plug-in-hybrid (HEV/PHEV) vehicles. Metal sulfides with unique physical and chemical properties, as well as high specific capacity/capacitance, which are typically multiple times higher than that of the carbon/graphite-based materials, are currently studied as promising electrode materials. However, the implementation of these sulfide electrodes in practical applications is hindered by their inferior rate performance and cycling stability. Nanostructures offering the advantages of high surface-to-volume ratios, favourable transport properties, and high freedom for the volume change upon ion insertion/extraction and other reactions, present an opportunity to build next-generation LIBs and SCs. Thus, the development of novel concepts in material research to achieve new nanostructures paves the way for improved electrochemical performance. Herein, we summarize recent advances in nanostructured metal sulfides, such as iron sulfides, copper sulfides, cobalt sulfides, nickel sulfides, manganese sulfides, molybdenum sulfides, tin sulfides, with zero-, one-, two-, and three-dimensional morphologies for LIB and SC applications. In addition, the recently emerged concept of incorporating conductive matrices, especially graphene, with metal sulfide nanomaterials will also be highlighted. Finally, some remarks are made on the challenges and perspectives for the future development of metal sulfide-based LIB and SC devices.
1. Introduction
The continuous burning of fossil fuels (e.g., petroleum, coal and natural gas) has intensified the global warming issue. In an effort to combat the soaring greenhouse gases emission caused by the combustion of these finite resources, society is racing towards the use of renewable resources, such as solar, wind, hydropower and geothermal energy, which offer sustainable energy without sacrificing environmental quality. However, these intermittent energy resources rely heavily on natural conditions (e.g., sunshine, rain, wind and location); thus, technology is required to convert the off-peak electricity into different forms for storage to fill the energy shortfalls during the on-peak period. To strike a balance between the needs of widespread energy demands and the ecological issues, investment in clean electrochemical energy, in particular lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and supercapacitors (SCs), is needed to usher in a green energy future. Both these energy storage devices are expected to play essential roles in our daily lives as the dominant power sources for portable consumer electronics (e.g., smartphones, tablets, notebook PCs and camcorders) and in hybrid electric/plug-in-hybrid (HEV/PHEV) vehicles.1–8
A typical LIB or SC system mainly consists of a negative electrode (anode), a positive electrode (cathode), an electrolyte and a separator sandwiched between the parallel facing electrodes (Fig. 1).9–15 The working principle of both devices involves the voltage-driven migration of cations (Li+, Na+, K+, and H+) or anions (OH−) through the electrolyte towards the electrodes for reversible electrochemical reactions. Moreover, the electrons flow through the external circuit to maintain the charge balance. Despite having similarities in the device architecture, manufacturing and technology (rocking-chair system), their charge storage mechanisms are markedly different. For LIBs, the electrochemical reaction of lithium ions in the bulk is realized along different chemical pathways, e.g. via an intercalation/de-intercalation reaction, conversion reaction and alloying/de-alloying reaction.16–21 Therefore, as shown in Fig. 2, LIBs generally contribute high energy density (∼120–200 W h kg−1) at the expense of power density (∼0.4–3 kW kg−1) due to the sluggish kinetics of lithium ion diffusion in the bulk. Unlike LIBs, SCs, including electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudo-capacitors, have the advantage of delivering energy in a shorter time scale by exploiting their fast surface or near surface (several tens of nanometers from the surface) reactions (physical absorption/desorption or Faradaic processes).22–26 This characteristic renders SCs with a high power density (5–30 kW kg−1) that far exceeds the level offered by LIBs despite having limited energy density (∼5–8 W h kg−1) (Fig. 2).

For the past few decades, metal sulfides (MSs) have emerged as the most prominent candidates for LIBs and SCs. Their unique physical and chemical properties (e.g., higher electrical conductivity, mechanical and thermal stability than those of their corresponding metal oxides), as well as the rich redox chemistry that contributes to their high specific capacity/capacitance (several times higher than those of carbon/graphite-based materials), make them stand out from other electrode materials.8,27–35 Unfortunately, the sluggish diffusivity of lithium ion in the MSs limits the rate of lithium insertion/extraction (low power), and the low surface area of the bulk electrodes restrains their capacitive contribution (low energy). To realize high-efficiency energy storage of MSs, tremendous research effort has been made in the nanoengineering of electrode materials to improve their power density for LIBs and energy density for SCs. Moving from conventional bulk to nanostructures offers several advantages for LIBs and SCs, including: (i) increase in electrode/electrolyte contact area per unit mass, which permits a higher lithium-ion flux across the interface for LIBs (i.e., higher charge/discharge rates) and more ion adsorption sites for double-layer formation and charge-transfer reactions for SCs (i.e., higher specific capacitances); (ii) shorter path lengths for ionic and electronic transport, resulting in a faster diffusion rate (i.e., higher power); (iii) better accommodation of the mechanical strain and structural distortion generated from ion insertion/extraction and other reactions (i.e., longer cycle life); and (iv) the occurrence of new reactions that are not possible for bulk materials.3,11,35–47 The strong correlation between the nanostructures and their electrochemical properties has prompted a surge in research to perform the controlled synthesis of innovative electrode materials with tailored nanostructures.
Furthermore, for LIB applications, the polysulfide Li2Sx (2 < x < 8) intermediates generated during the lithiation process easily react with or dissolve into the organic electrolyte, leading to an irreversible capacity decay of the MS anodes.48–53 The dissolution of polysulfides also results in the so-called shuttle effect, in which the soluble long-chain polysulfides diffuse to the surface of the cathode and are reduced to short-chain polysulfides. However, the re-oxidation of these species after being transported back to the anode does not contribute to the overall capacity. Thus, this process progressively decreases the active mass utilization and markedly reduces the coulombic efficiency. Moreover, the insulating polysulfides layer deposited on the surface of the electrode may deteriorate its conductivity and prevent further electrochemical reactions from taking place. To solve these challenges, nanostructured MSs that can hybridize with conductive matrices, such as carbon components, were further developed as composite electrodes to prevent the dissolution of polysulfides and reduce the interface resistance, leading to higher specific capacities at high charge/discharge rates, and an improved cyclability of the lithium storage.
In this review, an overview of recent progress made towards MS electrode engineering strategies for LIBs and SCs applications is provided. Moreover, MS crystal structures, charge storage mechanisms and electrochemical performances in terms of specific capacity/capacitance, cycling stability and rate capability are summarized. Thereafter, discussion on fundamental reasons that may make engineered MS a viable candidate will be covered in hope of paving a new research direction to bring this family one step forward towards the commercial implementation of this material. Moreover, insights into the future research and development of MS compounds for next-generation LIB and SC devices are also provided.
2. Nanostructured metal sulfide electrodes
2.1 Iron sulfides
On the basis of Fe–S phase diagram,54 iron sulfides have a multitude of possible stoichiometries and crystal structures dependent on the temperature, pressure, and sulfur concentration. Among them, troilite FeS, greigite Fe3S4, and pyrite FeS2 have long been studied as interesting high-capacity anode materials for LIBs.55–57 There are, however, only few reports on iron sulfides for SCs.
Troilite FeS shows a hexagonal crystal structure based on the NiAs structure (a = 3.67 Å, c = 5.04 Å) with alternating c-planes of Fe2+ and S2− ions (Fig. 3a).58–60 The lithiation and delithiation of FeS are described as FeS + 2Li+ + 2e− ↔ Li2S + Fe, and occur at the potential plateau of ca. 1.6 V vs. Li/Li+ with a theoretical capacity of 609 mA h g−1.34 The cubic close-packed crystal structure of greigite Fe3S4 is similar to that of magnetite Fe3O4, in which S2− ions substitute O2− ions, and the tetrahedral A-sites are occupied by Fe3+ ions and the octahedral B-sites are occupied half by Fe3+ ions and half by Fe2+ ions (Fig. 3b).59,61 The theoretical specific capacity of Fe3S4 is determined to be 725 mA h g−1, based on the electrochemical reaction of Fe3S4 + 8Li+ + 8e− ↔ 4Li2S + 3Fe at ca. 1.5 V vs. Li/Li+.62 The cubic pyrite FeS2 phase (space group Pa) is among the most abundant of the iron disulfides, and its crystalline structure is relatively complicated. The Fe2+ ions sit inside the sulfur octahedra and are at the corners and face centers of the cubic unit cell, while the S− ions are tetrahedrally coordinated by three Fe2+ ions and one S− ion (Fig. 3c).63–65 The electrochemical reaction of FeS2 with lithium involves two steps: FeS2 + 2Li+ + 2e− → Li2FeS2 at ∼2 V vs. Li/Li+, and Li2FeS2 + 2Li+ + 2e− → 2Li2S + Fe0 at ∼1.5 V vs. Li/Li+, yielding a theoretical capacity as high as 894 mA h g−1.55,66

Many groups have attempted to synthesize iron sulfide nanostructures using a variety of chemical or physical approaches for various applications.60,64,66–73 For example, needle-like FeS was prepared by the solvothermal decomposition of a precursor complex [Fe3(μ3-O)(μ2-O2CCH2Cl)6(H2O)3]NO3·H2O in the presence of thiourea at 150 °C for 12 h.67 Oriented-FeS nanotubes were synthesized via the sulfidation of hematite (α-Fe2O3) nanowire arrays with H2S gas at relatively low temperatures (200–300 °C).60 Vertically oriented single-crystalline FeS2 nanowires were fabricated via the thermal sulfidation of low-carbon steel foil at 350 °C for 2 h.68 Single-crystalline FeS2 nanorods, nanobelts and nanoplates were synthesized by the sulfidation reaction of iron dichloride (FeCl2) and iron dibromide (FeBr2).69 For LIB anode applications, Xia et al.74 developed a facile hydrothermal process for the preparation of FeS2 nanocrystals with diameters ranging from 10 to 35 nm, which show an initial discharge capacity of 885 mA h g−1 at a current density of 89 mA g−1 between 0.8 and 2.4 V vs. Li/Li+. After 40 cycles, the capacity deceases to 408 mA h g−1 and with a capacity retention of 46%. Li et al.75 demonstrated the large-scale synthesis of FeS2 nanowires via the chemical transformation of iron fluoride nanowires. Such nanoelectrodes exhibit a capacity of 668 mA h g−1 during the first discharge process over the voltage range of 2.4–1.1 V vs. Li/Li+ at 89 mA g−1, and retain 350 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles (capacity retention: 52%). Furthermore, Fe3S4 nanoplatelets were synthesized using 3-methyl catechol as the growth moderator and phase-control agent in the presence of sulfur, thiosulfate, octadecylamine and divalent iron ions (Fe2+).76 As seen from the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Fig. 4a), the as-synthesized nanocrystals have platelet-like morphologies with lateral dimensions of 10–20 nm. Both multicrystalline and monocrystalline Fe3S4 nanoplatelets can be identified separately in the high-resolution (HR) TEM images (Fig. 4b and c) by their distinctive lattice sets of greigite. These Fe3S4 nanoplatelets display attractive electrochemical activities towards lithiation/delithiation, as indicated by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves (Fig. 4d) with repeated broad cathodic peaks at 1.5 and 0.5 V vs. Li/Li+ and anodic peaks at 1.5 and 2.0 V vs. Li/Li+ (labeled as III, IV, I and II). Despite these successes, the practical use of these iron sulfide nanomaterials is still hindered by their high irreversible capacity loss during the first few charge–discharge cycles (i.e., low coulombic efficiency) and by the gradual breakdown of the electrode after multiple charge–discharge cycles (i.e., capacity fading). The underlying reasons for this are due to the volume expansion accompanied by the formation of the aforementioned polysulfides, which leads to capacity degradation.34,77–79

Surface modification of iron sulfides with carbonaceous materials such as amorphous carbon,80–82 and reduced graphene oxide (rGO)50 has been proven to be an effective strategy to alleviate these problems (Table 1). For example, Xu et al.80 reported a facile approach to prepare carbon-coated troilite FeS (C@FeS) nanosheets via a surfactant-assisted solution-based technique, in which 1-dodecanethiol (DDT) was used as the sulfur source and surfactant. The detailed synthetic procedure involved reacting Fe(acac)3 and DDT with a molar ratio of Fe(acac)3:DDT of 1:20 in oleylamine at 220 °C, followed by annealing at 400 °C for 2 h under an Ar atmosphere. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image in Fig. 5a and the TEM image in Fig. 5b reveal the formation of graphene-like FeS nanosheets with lateral dimensions of about 100–200 nm and thicknesses of less than 10 nm. The top-view high-magnification TEM (Fig. 5c) indicates the polycrystalline nature of an individual nanosheet comprising small nanocrystals (<5 nm). HRTEM images (Fig. 5d and e) show that the FeS nanosheets are coated with amorphous carbon layers (content: 7 wt%), which should be derived from the carbonization of organic surfactants capped on the surface of the precursors. As shown in Fig. 5f, such an anode delivers ninth-cycle discharge capacities of 630, 486, 425, 349, and 266 mA h g−1 at current densities of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, and 6.0 A g−1 between 0.01 and 3.0 V vs. Li/Li+, respectively. Moreover, the anode has an enhanced discharge capacity retention of 60% at 0.1 A g−1 after 100 cycles, in which the initial capacity of 1022 mA h g−1 reduces to 615 mA h g−1 at the 100th cycle (Fig. 5g). On the contrary, the C@FeS nanoparticle and nanoplate electrodes prepared by changing the concentration of DDT, and the reaction temperature show inferior performances compared to the C@FeS nanosheets. The superior lithium storage performances of C@FeS nanosheets are mainly attributed to: (1) the higher surface area (80.9 m2 g−1) of the nanosheets, which provides a larger amount of effective reaction sites between the electrode materials and electrolyte; (2) the ultrathin thickness of the nanosheets, which shortens the diffusion paths of the charge carriers and allows faster charge transfer; (3) the carbon layers that absorb and trap the polysulfides generated during the conversion reaction of sulfides, which reduces the dissolution of polysulfides and improves the cycling stability of the electrode.

Attaching conductive polymers, such as polyacrylonitrile (PAN)83 and polyaniline (PANI),84 to iron sulfides is another effective way to improve the cycling stabilities of iron sulfides. In 2013, pyrite FeS2 embedded in a stabilized PAN matrix (PAN–FeS2) was reported by Son et al.83 Its microstructure is confirmed by the cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. 6a), the electron energy loss spectrum (EELS) zero-loss image (Fig. 6b), and the corresponding EELS elemental mapping (Fig. 6c). The FeS2 electro-active species (Fe and Sn2−) is confined in a PAN matrix to prevent active material loss and improve the charge–discharge reversibility and the coulombic efficiency. Moreover, the stabilized PAN matrix can easily accommodate the volume expansion of FeS2 upon full discharge because it is not fully carbonized. As a result, the PAN–FeS2 electrode delivers a specific capacity of 470 mA h g−1, or 64% of its initial discharge capacity on the 50th discharge between 1.0 and 3.0 V vs. Li/Li+ at a rate of 89 mA g−1, whereas the bare FeS2 electrode has a value of only 120 mA h g−1 or 14% capacity retention (Fig. 6d). In addition to carbonaceous materials and conductive polymers, it is worth noting that other inorganic material modifications (e.g., Ag85 and TiO2 (ref. 86)) also open up new opportunities in the development of high performance iron sulfide anodes.

2.2 Copper sulfides
The Cu–S system exhibits many different stoichiometric compositions, over a wide range, from the copper-deficient side to the copper-rich side, including villamaninite (CuS2), covellite (CuS), yarrowite (Cu1.12S), spionkopite (Cu1.39S), geerite (Cu1.6S), anilite (Cu1.75S), digenite (Cu1.8S), djurleite (Cu1.96S) and chalcocite (Cu2S).87–90 Owing to the variations in compositions, complex structures, nanocrystalline morphologies, and valence states, these copper sulfides are of great interest in a wide range of applications, including photocatalysis,91 optoelectronic devices,92 sensors,93 LIBs,94 and SCs.95 Recently, metal-like CuS and Cu2S with good electrical conductivities, e.g., 9.5 × 10−3 S cm−1 for CuS and 8.3 × 10−4 S cm−1 for Cu2S,96 have become of particular interest in LIB and SC applications in view of their high capacities/capacitances.77,97–101
Covellite CuS has a hexagonal structure (space group P63/mmc, a = 3.79 Å and c = 16.34 Å) consisting of alternating CuS3–Cu3S–CuS3 layers and S–S layers along the c-axis direction (Fig. 7a).102–104 The interactions within the CuS3–Cu3S–CuS3 layers are covalent bonds, whereas the interactions between the S–S layers are van der Waals forces, which are allowed to electrochemically react with many cations or anions easily, yielding large capacities. The lithiation and delithiation of CuS involve two steps (i.e., two voltage plateaus at around 2.0 and 1.7 V vs. Li/Li+) with two main mechanisms proposed to explain these electrochemical behaviours. One is the lithium insertion reaction of CuS to form LixCuS phase in the first step, followed by the conversion of LixCuS to Li2S and Cu metal, i.e., CuS + xLi+ + xe− ↔ LixCuS and LixCuS + (2 − x)Li+ + (2 − x)e− ↔ Li2S + Cu.105–107 In contrast, some researchers propose the formation of Cu2S as an intermediate phase, accompanied by the reduction of this compound into Cu and Li2S according to the reactions: CuS + 2Li+ + 2e− ↔ Cu2S + Li2S and Cu2S + 2Li+ + 2e− ↔ 2Cu + Li2S.108–110 Overall, no matter what reaction pathways it takes, all of the authors agree that the fully discharged product is a mixture of metallic copper and Li2S, giving rise to a high theoretical capacity of 561 mA h g−1. Furthermore, the cathodic reduction of CuS shows promising capacitive behaviour.98

(c) and (d) are reproduced with permission from ref. 111. Copyright 2012, American Institute of Physics. 
Chalcocite Cu2S exists in three different crystal structures at different temperatures, i.e., monoclinic phase (low-chalcocite) forms at temperatures below 104 °C, hexagonal phase (high-chalcocite) forms between 104 and 436 °C, and cubic phase (cubic-chalcocite) forms at temperatures higher than 436 °C (Fig. 7b–d).111–113 The low-chalcocite form is also found to have an orthorhombic unit cell with 96 Cu2S, but it can be divided into two identical monoclinic cells Cu96S48 with only small modifications.114–116 Cu2S is also considered to be a promising conversion-based electrode material for applications in LIBs (theoretical capacity: 280 mA h g−1)117 and SCs.118
Recently, CuS and Cu2S nanostructures with different morphologies, including nanoparticles, nanoplatelets, nanorods, nanoribbons, nanoflowers, and hollow nanospheres, have been synthesized via solution chemistry, such as the aqueous solution method,119 organic-phase solution method,90,92,120–122 ionic liquid-assisted approach,123 sacrificial template method,124–127 hydrothermal route,91,128 solvothermal,129–131 microemulsion,87 biomolecule-assisted method,132 and the organic–aqueous interface reaction.133 Among these, some nanostructures were used to build high-performance CuS- and Cu2S-based electrodes for LIBs and SCs.53,134–143 For example, Nagarathinam et al.136 reported the synthesis of CuS hollow nanospheres with sizes of 250–300 nm (shell thickness: ∼70 nm) using a novel two-dimensional (2D) coordination polymer generated from a trinuclear building block [Cu3(HSser)3(H2O)2]·2H2O as the precursor. Moreover, they also fabricated a 3D hierarchical flower-like CuS (0.65–1.1 μm) through the self-assembly of nanoplates using the hydrogen-bonded metal complex [Cu(H2Sser)2]·H2O as the precursor. When they were evaluated as electrode materials for LIBs (voltage window: 1.8–2.6 V vs. Li/Li+), the CuS with a hollow interior was found to be more efficient in term of cyclability compared to that with a flower-like morphology. This is probably because of the high surface area and large surface-to-volume ratio of the hollow architecture, which reduces the transport length for both the Li ions and electrons. Moreover, the hollow structure can provide more access for the lithium insertion/extraction from/into liquid electrolyte and a capability to withstand local volume changes during the electrochemical lithiation/delithiation processes. Du et al.101 demonstrated a universal soft colloidal templating strategy towards the large-scale synthesis of 3.2 nm-thick hexagonal CuS nanosheets, which exhibits a large capacity and good cycling stability even after 360 cycles (∼640 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1). Furthermore, some CuS thin film LIB electrodes were also reported.137,138 In 2011, Chen et al.138 developed a single-crystalline and perpendicularly oriented CuS thin film with a flaky morphology on Pt substrates via electrodeposition in an ionic liquid electrolyte of [EMIm]TFSI (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide) containing Cu(TFSI)2 salt and elemental sulfur. CuS nanoflakes with a thickness of around 50 nm and width of ∼1 μm stack face to face. Such a thin film electrode exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 545 mA h g−1 within 1.5–2.5 V vs. Li/Li+ voltage window at a current rate of 28 mA g−1.
In 2012, Zhu et al.53 developed a novel template-engaged chemical conversion route to grow arrays of CuS ultrafine nanoneedles on a carbon nanotube (CNT) backbone (CNT@CuS) for SCs application. As shown in Fig. 8a, the functionalized CNTs are initially coated with a layer of mesoporous silica (step I) to promote the subsequent growth of CNT@SiO2@CuSilicate core–shell 1D nanostructures (step II). Finally, the CuSilicate nanoneedles are completely transformed into CuS nanoneedles via a hydrothermal treatment with Na2S (step III). Here, it is worth mentioning that, except for the sulfidation effect, the hydrolysis of sulfide ions can provide a mild alkaline environment to remove the silica gradually. The as-prepared CNT@CuS 1D hierarchical structures composed of ultrafine CuS nanoneedles are clearly displayed in Fig. 8b and c. The CV analysis of CNT@CuS reveals its pseudo-capacitive characteristics (Fig. 8d). The galvanostatic charge–discharge tests show capacitances of 122–89 F g−1 at current densities of 1.2 to 7.4 A g−1. Moreover, the CNT@CuS exhibits excellent cycling stability with almost no capacitance fading after 1000 cycles at 2.9 A g−1 (Fig. 8e), attributed to its high specific surface area (98 m2 g−1), which offers a large contact area for the fast diffusion of electrolyte ions between the active material and electrolyte. Afterwards, an enhanced SC electrode composed of polypyrrole (PPy)-coated CuS microspheres (CuS@PPy) was reported.139 The CuS@PPy composite (CuS content: 16.7 wt%) shows a high specific capacitance of 427 F g−1 in 1 M KCl electrolyte between −0.5 V and 0.5 V vs. SCE at a rate of 1 A g−1; moreover, its capacitance is retained up to 88% after 1000 cycles.

There are also many reports investigating nanostructured Cu2S as anode materials for LIBs.140–142 For example, Lai et al.142 developed a general solution method for the growth of perpendicularly ordered large-scale Cu2S nanowire arrays onto the Cu metal current collector. The Cu2S nanowires grow along the [100] direction, and the diameters and lengths of the nanostructures are around 40–120 nm and 700–1400 nm, respectively. The charge–discharge tests show an initial discharge and charge capacity of 470 and 400 mA h g−1, respectively, for Cu2S nanowire arrays tested in the potential range of 0.05 to 3.0 V vs. Li/Li+ and at a high rate of 560 mA g−1. After 100 cycles, about 230 mA h g−1 (more than 50% of their initial capacity) is maintained. The high reversible lithium storage capacity at the high rate is not only due to the intimate contact between the nanowires and the current collector, which leads to easier transportation for electrons, but also due to the flexibility of the nanowire arrays to accommodate the strain upon the lithium ion insertion/extraction at higher charge/discharge rates.
Furthermore, there was an interesting work carried out by Cai et al.143 who reported the implementation of a mixed CuS/Cu2S phase (CuxS, 1 < x < 2) with a nanotube morphology for LIB anodes. Fig. 9a elucidates the preparation process, in which the Cu nanowires are initially synthesized by a solvothermal route, and then reacted with thiourea at 180–190 °C under an argon atmosphere in polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution for various durations to completely convert them into CuxS nanotubes (x = 1.34, CuS/Cu2S = 1.88) (denoted as S-120). The conversion of Cu nanowires into CuxS nanotubes is a mass diffusion process. After a duration of 30 min, a mixed phase CuS/Cu2S = 5.02 (i.e., x = 1.16) with ∼32.3 wt% metallic Cu is obtained. When extending the reaction time to 60 min, the product is CuS/Cu2S = 2.18 (i.e., x = 1.31) with ∼10.0 wt% Cu. After reacting for 120 min, the metallic Cu is completely converted into CuxS (x = 1.34, CuS/Cu2S = 1.88). The SEM (Fig. 9b) and TEM (Fig. 9c) images of S-120 confirm the tubular structure with widths of 170–200 nm and wall thicknesses of 15–30 nm. The HRTEM image (inset of Fig. 9c) reveals the existence of both hexagonal Cu2S and CuS. The galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements (Fig. 9d) at a current density of 200 mA g−1 between 3.0 and 0 V vs. Li/Li+ reveal that the S-120 electrode has an initial discharge capacity of 779 mA h g−1 and a subsequent charge capacity of 581 mA h g−1. Fig. 9e indicates the good cycling stability of S-120 anode with 526 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles. The stable cycling performance is possibly due to the surface capping of PEG, which helps to reduce the dissolution of lithium polysulfides into the electrolytes.

2.3 Cobalt sulfides
According to the phase diagram of Co–S, cobalt sulfides can exist in different stoichiometric compositions, such as Co4S3, Co9S8, CoS, Co3S4, Co2S3, and CoS2, endowing them with rich structure chemistry and distinguishable properties to suit the requirements for different applications.144 Since most of the advanced functional materials depend intimately on their accessible surface area, great interest has concentrated on the controllable synthesis of cobalt sulfide nanomorphologies. For example, Yin et al.145 had made a successful attempt to synthesize colloidal Co9S8 and Co3S4 hollow structures by executing the thermal decomposition of Co2(CO)8 to form Co nanocrystals, followed by sulfidation in an organic medium. Moreover, well-defined cobalt sulfides nanostructures can be achieved using a template-assisted method. In this regard, CoS polyhedral nanocages were derived from a mesoporous metal–organic framework (MOF),146 while CoS147 and Co9S8 (ref. 148) were successfully converted from Co3O4 and Co(CO3)0.5(OH)x·11H2O by the anion exchange reaction with Na2S, respectively. To eliminate the disadvantages stemming from the template-assisted method, the assembling of cobalt sulfides into 3D hierarchical nanostructures was demonstrated by Liu et al.149via a solvothermal route, in which the unique architectures offer a large accessible surface area by having a robust framework.
Among the diverse crystal structures of cobalt sulfides, Co9S8, CoS, and CoS2 have been widely studied as electrode materials in energy storage systems. Resembling the crystal structure of FeS, stoichiometric CoS with a space group of P63/mmc (a = b = 3.37 Å and c = 5.14 Å) is hexagonal in nature.150 Its two electrons conversion reaction gives rise to a theoretical capacity of 590 mA h g−1, according to the equation: CoS + 2Li+ + 2e− ↔ Co + Li2S.151,152 Pyrite CoS2 has a cubic crystal arrangement with a space group of Pa (a = b = c = 5.53 Å), in which the sulfur atoms are presented as S22− anions and paired with the Co2+ cations in the lattice (Fig. 10a).153 The reversible reaction between the CoS2 and lithium leads to a theoretical capacity of 870 mA h g−1 with the general expression as follows: CoS2 + 4Li+ + 4e− ↔ Co + 2Li2S.154,155 However, different perspectives are advocated to describe the lithium storage behaviour of CoS and CoS2, in which both the intercalation and conversion reactions are taken into account in the voltage range of 3.0–0.0 V (vs. Li/Li+). In the voltage range of 1.9–1.5 V (vs. Li/Li+), LixCoS/LixCoS2 intermediates are formed as a result of the lithium insertion reaction, which is followed by the displacement reaction of the intermediates to form Li2S and Co.156,157 On the other hand, C9S8 with the Fmm space group (a = b = c = 9.927 Å)158 has a cubic close-packed arrangement of atoms, in which 8/9 of the Co atoms are paired with the S tetrahedron and 1/9 of Co atoms are coordinated to the S octahedral (Fig. 10b).158–160 The reaction mechanism of C9S8 with lithium can be expressed as: Co9S8 + 16Li+ + 16e− ↔ 9Co + 8Li2S at ∼1.0 V (vs. Li/Li+), showing a theoretical capacity of 539 mAh g−1.160–162

For LIB applications, Ko et al.163 demonstrated a two-step process (spray pyrolysis and sulfidation) to prepare Co9S8 yolk–shell spheres (diameter: ∼700 nm). In a comparative study, the yolk–shell Co9S8 microspheres were able to deliver higher discharge and charge capacities (1008 and 767 mA h g−1) than the filled Co9S8 microspheres (838 and 638 mA h g−1) in the first cycle at a constant current density of 1 A g−1. Furthermore, the yolk–shell Co9S8 microspheres retained 82% of its initial capacity after 100 cycles, whereas the filled Co9S8 microspheres experienced a dramatic capacity fading, and they maintained only 66% of its initial capacity. Likewise, Wang et al.158 found that the Co9S8 nanotubes show an improved electrochemical performance compared to the Co9S8 nanoparticles. Both studies proved that the performance gap between these hollow and solid counterparts relies on the structural effect imposed by the morphological characteristics. On the other hand, a solvothermal method was employed to synthesize 3D flower-like CoS164 and CoS2 hollow structures.153 Initial discharge capacities of 890 and 1210 mA h g−1 could be delivered by CoS (at 50 mA g−1) and CoS2 (at 100 mA g−1), respectively. Apart from optimizing the electrochemical performance of the cobalt sulfides by imposing the nanosizing effect, carbonaceous support, such as CNT165 and rGO,151,155,166,167 is also used as the mechanically rigid framework for the deposition of cobalt sulfides to address the electrical conductivity and agglomeration issues of the electro-active materials. Furthermore, the carbon matrices can also cushion the volume expansion and prevent the severe pulverization of the cobalt sulfide nanostructures during the lithium uptake and release processes. For example, both the CoS/graphene reported by Gu et al.166 and the CoS2/graphene reported by Xie et al.155 show improvements in cycling and rate performances compared to their pristine counterparts.
On the other hand, the confinement of metal sulfides in porous or amorphous carbon represents an efficient strategy to suppress the polysulfide dissolution and shuttle effect.168 Shi et al.162 demonstrated a solution-based method to synthesize carbon coated Co9S8 dandelions (C@Co9S8). Fig. 11a illustrates the schematic representation of the formation mechanism of the Co9S8 dandelions, whereby the nanostructures were made from Co9S8 nanoparticles by substituting the DDT sulfur sources with sulfur powder. The SEM image (Fig. 11b) reveals that the dandelion-shaped C@Co9S8 is about 250 nm. TEM (Fig. 11c) and HRTEM (Fig. 11d and e) images clearly show that each dandelion is hierarchically assembled by polycrystalline nanosheets with thicknesses of <5 nm. In addition, the annealing process carbonized the surface-chelated organic molecules into a thin layer of amorphous carbon (Fig. 11e). The discharge–charge voltage profiles (Fig. 11f) of C@Co9S8 dandelions were measured at 1 A g−1 in the voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V (vs. Li/Li+). The 1st-cycle discharge and charge capacities are 848 and 619 mA h g−1, respectively. After 50 cycles, a reversible capacity of 520 mA h g−1 is still obtained by C@Co9S8 dandelions, while Co9S8 nanoparticles can only reach 338 mA h g−1, indicating the protective effect of the amorphous carbon (Fig. 11g). Furthermore, the tenth-cycle discharge capacities of the C@Co9S8 (Fig. 11h) hint at its good rate capability, in which 636, 563, 506 and 373 mA h g−1 are delivered at current densities of 1, 2, 4 and 6 A g−1, respectively, which apparently outperforms the Co9S8 nanoparticles. It is found that C@Co9S8 dandelions have advantages in offering unique 3D open structures to buffer the volume strain generated upon Li+ intercalation/de-intercalation processes. Furthermore, the large surface area and ultrathin thickness of the C@Co9S8 dandelions are beneficial for increasing the contact area at the electrolyte/active material interfaces and shortening the charge diffusion pathways.

In SC applications, the energy is stored and released by exploiting the faradaic reaction of CoSx with OH− and inducing the electron transition between the Co2+/Co3+ redox couple.169 The general expressions can be simplified as: CoSx + OH− ↔ CoSxOH + e−, and CoSxOH + OH− ↔ CoSxO + H2O + e−.146,170,171 In an attempt to achieve a higher active surface area for capacitive enhancement, much research has been devoted to tailoring the morphology of the cobalt sulfide nanostructures. In this regard, morphologies such as hierarchical structures,172–174 nanosheets,175–177 nanowires,178 nanotubes,179,180 ellipsoids,169 and hollow structures,181 have been reported in the literature. For example, the successful synthesis of hollow CoS2 spheres was accomplished by Peng et al.181 who employed a facile hydrothermal method. Interplay between different concentrations of carbon disulfide (CS2, sulfur sources) and ethylenediamine (EN, surfactants) gives rise to various interesting morphologies, e.g., solid, yolk–shell, double-shell and hollow nanostructures (Fig. 12a). Uniform nanosheet-assembled hierarchical spheres with ∼800 nm in diameter are revealed in the SEM image in Fig. 12b. Some of the broken interfaces in Fig. 12b indicate their hollow interior, which is further evidenced by TEM investigation (Fig. 12c). The HRTEM (Fig. 12c) illustrates that the CoS2 hollow nanostructures with wall thicknesses of ∼150 nm are encrusted with nanosheet subunits of ∼5 nm. By changing the amounts of CS2, solid, yolk–shell and double-shell CoS2 spheres are prepared (Fig. 12d–f). The CV curves (scan rate: 30 mV s−1) of various CoS2 samples suggest typical pseudocapacitive characteristics, involving the changes of the Co2+/Co3+ redox couple (Fig. 12g). In terms of rate capability, the CoS2 hollow nanostructures are able to deliver specific capacitances of 1301, 1073, 883, 650 and 450 F g−1 at current densities of 1, 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 A g−1, respectively (Fig. 12h), surpassing other CoS2 counterparts. A similar trend is also observed in the cycling performance, in which the CoS2 hollow nanostructures show better stability than the others during 2000 cycles (Fig. 12i). This demonstrates the contribution of the structural effect in providing improvements in the electrochemical properties of the electro-active CoS2 from different aspects such as: (1) the nanosheet subunits giving rise to a higher surface area for the redox reaction; and (2) the hierarchically assembled frameworks with mesoporous characteristics serving as the robust reservoirs for ions and reducing the ion diffusion path within the electrodes.

To further improve the power density of a SC, a binder-free approach was applied to reduce the equivalent series resistance (ESR) of the electrode.175,179,182,183 For example, nickel foam-supported Co9S8 nanotube arrays were synthesized by Pu et al.179 through a two-step hydrothermal method, in which the tubule formation was caused by the nanoscale Kirkendall effect. The Co9S8 nanotube array electrode can deliver 1775, 1635, 1600, 1563, 1520 and 1483 F g−1 at current densities of 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 A g−1, respectively, indicating its excellent rate capability. Moreover, 83.5% of its initial capacitance is preserved at the 2000th cycle at a high current density of 16 A g−1. This anion conversion was also adopted by Xia et al.182 to prepare free-standing CoS nanoarrays using carbon fibre and nickel foam substrates. The formation mechanism of cobalt sulfide nanostructures is schematically visualized in Fig. 13a. In brief, Co3O4 or Co(OH)2 nanoarrays pre-grown on the substrate are sulfidized into CoS using Na2S as the sulfur source. From the SEM image (Fig. 13b), it can be seen that the substrate is densely covered by the 1D Co3O4 nanostructures. After the sulfidation process, CoS is formed and the 1D morphology is still retained, showing diameters of ∼80 nm and lengths of ∼5 μm (Fig. 13c). As seen from Fig. 13e, the surface texture of CoS becomes relatively rough after the ion exchange reaction, as compared to the cobalt precursors (Fig. 13d). The CoS nanoarrays show excellent rate performance by exhibiting 129 and 102 mA h g−1 at 2 and 40 A g−1, respectively (Fig. 13f). In addition, the CoS nanoarrays only experience 9% capacity fading after 3000 cycles, indicating their good cycling stability (Fig. 13g). A comparative study between the self-supported CoS nanowire arrays and their powder counterpart reveals that the free-standing CoS nanoarrays have great advantages in reducing the electrode polarization by having an intimate connection with the current collector, resulting in enhanced electrochemical performance. Similarly, direct growth of Co9S8 arrays on carbon cloth was also achieved by Xu et al.171 In a three-electrode configuration, optimized Co9S8 samples exhibited specific capacitance of 2.35 F cm−2 (783.3 F g−1 for active materials and 113.5 F g−1 for the overall electrode) at 5 mV s−1, and retained 0.56 F cm−2 at 200 mV s−1. The vertically aligned architecture enables the Co9S8 to have an excellent performance at high current densities, in which real specific capacitances of 0.86 and 0.84 F cm−2 are achieved at 10 and 50 mA cm−2, respectively. The binder-free Co9S8 arrays are beneficial to reduce the internal and the charge transfer resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces.

2.4 Nickel sulfides
The family of nickel sulfides consists of compounds with disparate combinations of N to S ratios, including Ni3+xS2, Ni3S2, Ni6S5, Ni7S6, Ni9S8, NiS, Ni3S4, and NiS2.184 Because of the rich chemistry of nickel sulfides, they are applicable to a wide range of applications, such as dye-sensitized solar cells,185 catalysis,186 hydrogen production,187 paramagnetic-antiferromagnetic agents,188 and electrodes of LIBs189 and SCs.190 In particular, among these, NiS, Ni3S2, NiS2, and Ni3S4 have gained much interest for lithium storage and SCs.
Stoichiometric NiS undergoes a phase transformation under the influence of temperature, in which it exists as the rhombohedral β-NiS (a = b = 3.420 Å and c = 5.300 Å, space group R3m) at low temperature and its crystal structure changes to hexagonal α-NiS (a = b = 9.620 Å and c = 3.160 Å, space group P63/mmc) at high temperature.191,192 The theoretical capacity of NiS has been reported to be 590 mA h g−1, according to the two-electron transfer reaction: NiS + 2Li+ + 2e− ↔ Ni + Li2S (∼1.4 V vs. Li/Li+).193 Ni3S2 has a rhombohedral structure with a space group of R32 (a = b = 4.08 Å, γ = 89.5°).194 Its theoretical capacity of 446 mA h g−1 can be derived from the following equation: Ni3S2 + 4Li+ + 4e− → 3Ni + 2Li2S (∼1.2 V vs. Li/Li+).195,196 NiS2 has a cubic unit cell with a Pa space group (a = b = c = 5.689 Å).197 According to the electrochemical equation: NiS2 + 4Li+ + 4e− ↔ Ni + 2Li2S (∼1.5 V vs. Li/Li+), the theoretical capacity of NiS2 is about 870 mA h g−1.197 However, Yamaguchi et al.198 proposed that the lithium storage reaction of NiS2 involves the formation of Li2NiS2, followed by the self-decomposition of this intermediate, or the formation of NiS as the intermediate, followed by the reduction of NiS to metallic Ni. Ni3S4 has a cubic crystal structure with a Fd3m space group (a = b = c = 9.49 Å).194 The lithiation mechanism of Ni3S4 follows a two-step reaction: Ni3S4 + xLi+ + xe− ↔ LixNi3S4 (∼1.5 V vs. Li/Li+) and LixNi3S4 + (8 − x)Li+ + (8 − x)e− ↔ 3Ni + 4Li2S (∼1.1 V vs. Li/Li+), leading to a theoretical capacity of 705 mA h g−1.199
In LIB applications, traditional approaches, such as the high-temperature solid-state reaction152,195,197 and the ball-milling method,193,200–203 have been reported for the preparation of nickel sulfides. To further constrain the dimensions of nickel sulfides into nano-regimes, several approaches, such as the hydrothermal/solvothermal method,204,205 electrodeposition,206 and colloidal synthesis,207,208 were employed for accessing nanostructures with a well-defined composition and morphology. For instance, urchin-like NiS was synthesized by Mi et al.209 using a solvothermal method. The initial discharge capacity of 567 mA h g−1, which is close to the theoretical value, can be obtained at the current density of 10 mA g−1. Using a hydrothermal method reported by Wang et al.,210 hierarchical NiS microspheres are assembled from nanorods and can deliver an initial discharge capacity of 588 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1. Tatsumisago's group207,208 synthesized colloidal nickel sulfide nanostructures by the thermal decomposition of nickel(II) acetylacetonate in high boiling point organic solvents. In the all-solid-state cell configuration, NiS nanoparticles demonstrate a discharge capacity of 680 mA h g−1 at the 20th cycle at a rate of 0.13 mA cm−2.207 On the other hand, a spark-plasma-sintering process is adopted to synthesize porous NiS2,197 which shows an initial discharge capacity of 820 mA h g−1 at 175 mA g−1.
Furthermore, the in situ growth of nickel sulfide nanostructures on current collectors (e.g., nickel foam or copper foil) has been proven to be another complementary route towards enhanced lithium storage properties. Typically, the nickel substrates are employed as both the current collector and the nickel source for the growth of nickel sulfides. Such a unique architecture provides an intimate electrical contact between the active materials and the current collector, which is beneficial to improve the kinetics of the electrode. For example, a porous NiS/Ni nanostructured electrode was fabricated through a dry thermal sulfuration method.211 The electrode showed good rate capability, in which specific capacity of 572, 509, 453 and 394 mA h g−1 can be obtained at rates of 177, 590, 1180, and 2950 mA g−1, respectively. The oriented growth of large-scale Ni3S2 nanowire arrays on nickel foil can be accomplished by the simple precipitation of Ni precursors under alkaline conditions in the presence of sulfur powder.212 A possible growth mechanism for the Ni3S2 nanowire arrays is proposed in Fig. 14a. Their morphologies are demonstrated in Fig. 14b–d. The Ni3S2 nanowire array electrode exhibits the first discharge and charge capacities of 480 and 430 mA h g−1 at a current density of 45 mA g−1, respectively. Moreover, this electrode is able to maintain more than 80% of its initial value after 100 cycles, and it preserves higher specific capacities than the Ni3S2 thin film electrode in terms of cycling and rate performances. Moreover, further enhancements in cycling performances are achieved for hydrothermally produced Ni3S2 nanostructures on nickel substrates at a current density of 50 mA g−1, in which ∼85% of its initial capacity can be obtained for carpet-like Ni3S2 after 60 cycles,204 and ∼90% capacity retention is realized for the flock-like Ni3S2 after 80 cycles.213 Ni3S2 nanomorphologies grown on Ni substrates can also be achieved by solvothermal synthesis by tuning the solvent polarity and reaction temperature. In this regard, Mi et al.205,214 reported vertically grown Ni3S2 rod arrays and 1D nanochains, in which the Ni3S2 rod arrays show an initial discharge capacity of 593 mA h g−1 at a current density of 14.2 mA g−1, and the 1D Ni3S2 nanochains display a 1st-discharge capacity of ∼550 mA h g−1 at a current density of 40.0 mA g−1. Other than the Ni substrates, Su et al.206 anchored the Ni3S2 nanoparticles on the copper current collector using an electrodeposition method, which showed 95.3% capacity retention between the 2nd and 100th cycle at 170 mA g−1.

On the other hand, improved electrochemical performance induced by the foreign carbonaceous materials has also been reported. For example, camphoric carbon-wrapped NiS hybrids were synthesized using a hydrothermal method.215 Such an electrode is able to achieve a stable cycling performance, in which the specific capacity is maintained from 290 (1st cycle) to 225 mA h g−1 (100th cycle) at a current density of 15 mA g−1. The concept of using amorphous carbon as a protective layer was also claimed by Wang et al.216 who demonstrated the synthesis of carbon-confined NiS nanostructures employing a MOF-templating approach. In addition to having a better rate capability than the bare NiS, the carbon encapsulated NiS can maintain a specific capacity of 300 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 60 mA g−1. Moreover, ultrathin NiS nanosheet/graphene hybrids (NiS/G) also exhibit enhanced electrochemical performance compared to the bare NiS.217 The homogeneous growth of NiS nanosheets on the graphene surface can be evidenced by the TEM and HRTEM observations (Fig. 15a and b), as well as the corresponding EDX mapping analysis (red circle regions in Fig. 15a and b). Fig. 15c shows the charge and discharge curves of the NiS/G and NiS in the first three cycles at 50 mA g−1, in which higher specific charge/discharge capacities (∼700 mA h g−1) can be obtained for the graphene-incorporated electrode. In terms of cycling stability, the NiS/G delivers a specific capacity of 481 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles, but the bare NiS experiences rapid capacity fading from the first few cycles (Fig. 15d). A similar trend is also observed for the rate performance, e.g., the NiS/G reaches a charge capacity of 386 mA h g−1, while the bare NiS only achieves a capacity of <100 mA h g−1 at 800 mA g−1. Another report relates to Ni3S2 nanoparticles wrapped with in situ generated N-doped graphene sheets (Ni3S2@N-G).218 At the end of 150 cycles, a reversible capacity of 809 mA h g−1 was obtained for the Ni3S2@N-G at a rate of 50 mA g−1, which is in contrast to the unstable performance of bare Ni3S2 that only delivers 100 mA h g−1 after 40 cycles. In addition, Hou et al.199 explored a hydrothermal method to synthesize Ni3S4 nanoparticles (ca. 40 to 115 nm) on nitrogen-doped graphene (Ni3S4/NG). Notably, the charge–discharge capacities of the 2nd and 50th cycles are as high as ∼1300 mA h g−1 at a current density of 140 mA g−1, which are almost close to those of the 1st cycle (∼1600 mA h g−1), indicating an extraordinary capacity retention and cycling behaviour of this Ni3S4/NG composite. The enhanced lithium storage performances for these graphene-based nickel sulfide hybrid structures can be attributed to the presence of a graphene buffer layer, which accommodates the volume variation of the nickel species, facilitates the electron transfer and preserves the electrical integrity of the whole electrode.

The electrochemical behaviour of nickel sulfides in SCs involves the reversible redox reaction of Ni(II) ↔ Ni(III) in the presence of hydroxide counter anions and can be generalized as follows: NiSx + OH− ↔ NiSxOH + e−. In the literature, nickel sulfides (NiS, NiS2, Ni3S2) tend to assemble into hierarchical nanosheets. Taking advantage of their ultrathin and porous nature, the extrusion pathway of electrolyte ions is greatly reduced, accompanied by an increased accessible active surface area. For example, Zhu et al.219 exploited the scaffold of a SiO2 template to synthesize the homogeneous hierarchical NiS hollow spheres. The hollow structures endow the electrode with larger interfacial contact between the active materials and electrolyte and thus allow faster ionic diffusion. As a result, specific capacitances of 927, 618, and 583 F g−1 are obtained at 4.08, 8.16, and 10.2 A g−1, respectively. Good cycling stability is shown by it retaining ∼70% of its initial capacitance even after a deep cycling of 1000–3000 times. In another report, flower-like NiS was synthesized via a solvothermal method.220 The electrode shows 966, 895, 513 and 481 F g−1 at current densities of 0.5, 1, 5 and 10 A g−1, respectively. At the end of 1000 cycles, 710 F g−1 could also be retained at the current density of 2 A g−1. On the other hand, the direct growth of nickel sulfides on the current collector can guarantee a fast electron transfer between the current collector and active materials and maintain the electrical integrity of the electrode. In this regard, electrochemical deposition has been employed to obtain an interconnected thin layer of Ni3S2 on nickel current collectors.190 The flaky Ni3S2 nanostructures exhibit impressive capacitances by maintaining values of 717, 664, 602, 515 and 411 F g−1 at current densities of 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 A g−1, respectively, without sacrificing its good cycling stability. Similarly, Xing et al.221 also used the electrodeposition approach to functionalize the ZnO arrays grown on nickel foam with Ni3S2 (ZnO@Ni3S2). The unique 3D nanoarray structures result in good electrochemical performances, in which specific capacitance of 1529 and 820 F g−1 were achieved at current densities of 2 and 50 A g−1, respectively, in addition to showing 604 F g−1 at a current density of 10 A g−1 after 2000 cycles. The direct growth of ZnO arrays on nickel foam increased the specific surface area and reinforced the electron transport between the Ni3S2 and the current collector, hence giving rise to better electrochemical performances.
Furthermore, Ni et al.222 prepared ultrathin NiS2 nanoflakes/chain-like Ni nanowire core–shell structures. Foam-like nickel hierarchical structures of ultrathin nanosheets supported on thin wires composed of nanoparticles were initially prepared by a facile one-pot synthesis via a controlled nucleation and growth process, followed by the sulfidation process (Fig. 16a). SEM images (Fig. 16b and c) of the Ni precursors reveal a sponge-like wire morphology comprised of radiated nanosheets, which is well-retained after reaction with the sulfur vapor. Such a unique structure delivers high specific capacitances of 1685, 1545, 1223 and 750 F g−1 at current densities of 1, 3, 10 and 30 A g−1, respectively (Fig. 16d). As shown in Fig. 16e, a range of specific capacitances from 1400 to 1000 F g−1 can be obtained at 3 A g−1 with a retention ratio of 78% after 1000 cycles, indicating its high capacitance and further improvement in cycling stability. The incorporation of CNT as the conductive scaffold for improved electrical property and diffusion kinetics has been reported by Zhu et al.223 The epitaxial growth of hierarchical ultrathin Ni3S2 nanosheets on the surface of CNT (CNT@Ni3S2) constructs a high-performance electrode that shows a high specific capacitance at a high current density, in which specific capacitance of 514 and 362 F g−1 can be delivered at current densities of 4 and 13.3 A g−1, respectively. Furthermore, the CNT@Ni3S2 electrode (88% of its initial capacitance) also surpasses the pure NiS nanosheet electrode (65% of its initial capacitance) after 1500 cycles at 5.3 A g−1, demonstrating the synergistic effect induced by the CNT in providing enhanced cycling stability to the whole electrode. Hierarchically structured Ni3S2/CNT composites are also synthesized by Dai et al.224via a hydrothermal approach. In an asymmetric testing configuration that consists of an activated carbon anode and Ni3S2/MWCNT cathode, good capacitive behaviour can be observed, e.g., specific capacitance of 56, 52, 48, 44 and 35 F g−1 at rates of 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 A g−1, respectively. Moreover, the asymmetric SC shows excellent cycling stability, in which 90% of its initial capacitance can be retained after 5000 cycles. The high power density of 6.4 kW kg−1 at an energy density of 15.4 W h kg−1 is a step towards practical application of this asymmetric SC. On the other hand, a multi-component nanostructure of Ni3S2 nanorod@Ni(OH)2 nanosheet on a three-dimensional graphene network (Ni3S2@Ni(OH)2/3DGN) was reported by Zhou et al.225 Specific capacitances of 1038 and 398 F g−1 are obtained at current densities of 5.1 and 19.8 A g−1, respectively. At a current density of 5.9 A g−1, the Ni3S2@Ni(OH)2/3DGN electrode is able to deliver 981 F g−1 after 2000 cycles (99.1% of its initial capacitance), surpassing the Ni(OH)2/3DGN and Ni3S2/3DGN counterparts.

2.5 Manganese sulfides
Manganese sulfides have three distinct polymorphs, which are α-, β-, and γ-MnS.226 α-MnS is commonly known as ordered rock-salt structure with a cubic-phase (a = b = c = 5.224 Å, space group Fm3m).227 Different from the α-MnS polymorph, β-MnS is metastable with a cubic zinc-blende crystal structure (a = b = c = 5.615 Å, space group F3m),228,229 while the hexagonal γ-MnS has a wurtzite crystal structure (a = b = 3.979 Å and c = 6.446 Å, space group P63mc).230 In the literature, solution colloidal synthesis has been regarded as an effective way to precisely control the homogeneity and morphology of MnS.231–235 For instance, γ-MnS with different morphologies (e.g., nanorods, bullet-shape, and hexagonal shape) can be produced by thermolysis of the MnCl2 and sulfur powder in oleylamine solvent under argon protection.231 Long-chain alkyl group coordinated precursors such as manganese oleates are also used to give anisotropic control over the growth of MnS in order to achieve a high degree of homogeneity.232–234 In addition, Ge et al.236 demonstrated the possibility of using CVD as a one-step route to fabricate 1D MnS nanostructures on a Si substrate by following the vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) mechanism. Other general approaches are also employed for the synthesis of MnS such as hydrothermal229,237–239 and solvothermal methods.240–244
As anodes for LIBs, MnS adopts a conversion reaction described as follows: MnS + 2Li+ + 2e− ↔ Mn + Li2S (∼0.7 V vs. Li/Li+), giving rise to a theoretical capacity of 616 mA h g−1.245 In an early report, Zhang et al.245 demonstrated a facile hydrothermal method to synthesize α-MnS submicrocrystals for LIB application. In this regard, α-MnS samples with different particle sizes and degrees of crystallinity were prepared by controlling the hydrothermal temperatures. By striking a balance between these two parameters, the α-MnS electrode obtained at 160 °C showed the best performance by preserving 81% of its second lithiation capacity and delivering 578 mA h g−1 after 20 cycles at a current density of 50 mA g−1. On the other hand, hollow α-MnS microboxes (thickness: ∼0.6 μm) with well-defined interior voids (∼1.2 μm) and surface permeability were successfully achieved by Zhang et al.246 using a two-step method. Specifically, the pre-synthesized MnCO3 microcubes are transformed into porous MnS microboxes by annealing at 800 °C under H2S atmosphere. These hollow α-MnS microboxes present high discharge capacities of 1117 and 759 mA h g−1 at a current density of 200 mA g−1 during the first and second cycle, respectively. A good cycling stability is also demonstrated from the second cycle onwards, in which a specific capacity of 495 mA h g−1 can be still obtained after 100 cycles.
Moreover, surface modification of MnS is highly pursued to compensate for its low electrical conductivity. In this regard, several approaches were developed to hybridize amorphous carbon247–249 or graphene227,250 with MnS using different synthetic methods. For instance, Beltran-Huarac et al.247 fabricated carbon-coated γ-MnS core–shell nanowires (γ-MnS/C) via a CVD method using MnCl2 and sulfur powder as the precursors by following the VLS growth mechanism (Fig. 17a). SEM images (Fig. 17b and c) reveal that the γ-MnS/C nanowires possess lengths of ∼100 μm and diameters of 60–100 nm. The core–shell structures can be clearly depicted under TEM observation, as shown in Fig. 17d, in which inner diameters are estimated to be in the range of 20–50 nm. Furthermore, the interface between the graphitic carbon and γ-MnS can be distinguished from HRTEM (Fig. 17e). The first and second discharge capacities of the γ-MnS/C are 1036 and 747 mA h g−1 at a current density of 1000 mA g−1, respectively. From the second cycle onwards, it achieves 503 and 321 mA h g−1 at the 25th and 60th cycles, respectively. The high capacities can be attributed to: (1) the nanosized γ-MnS/C, which contributes to the large surface-to-volume ratio and subsequently shortens the lithium diffusion pathway, and (2) the epitaxial growth of highly conductive carbon on the γ-MnS, which generates more active zones for the electrochemical reaction and suppresses the polysulfides shuttling. The spray pyrolysis method provides an efficient way to synthesize MnS–C hollow spheres using the gas-phase reaction.248 It is found that the MnS nanocrystals are uniformly distributed within the carbon matrix. This MnS–C anode (at 0.01–3.0 V vs. Li/Li+, 100 mA g−1) displays initial discharge and charge capacities of 1445 and 851 mA h g−1, respectively. More remarkably, its discharge capacity increases gradually and reaches 967 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles, which is primarily attributed to the formation of a polymeric gel-like film on the active material.47,251,252 The excellent rate capability of the hollow MnS–C sample is also achieved by its discharge capacities of 841 and 506 mA h g−1 at rates of 200 and 2000 mA g−1, respectively. This enhanced electrochemical performance is due to its structural stability imposed by the carbon layer and the hollow interiors. In addition, Liu et al.249 reported the hydrothermal synthesis of coral-like N-doped carbon/MnS composite. The galvanostatic charge and discharge of the composite sintered at 800 °C show an initial discharge capacity of 976 mA h g−1 at a rate of 50 mA g−1 and stabilize at 536 mA h g−1. Increasing the current densities to 100, 200, 400, 800, and 1000 mA g−1, achieves reversible capacities of 496, 484, 456, 416, and 407 mA h g−1, respectively. It is believed that the cross-linked MnS porous structures on the N-doped network help to improve the lithium insertion/extraction reaction.

Further enhancements in MnS nanostructured anodes can also be achieved with the aid of rGO.227,48 Recently, Chen et al.227 hybridized the MnS hollow structures with rGO via a hydrothermal method. The formation mechanism of the hollow structures lies in the Ostwald ripening process from the spherical aggregates, and results in highly porous structures (Fig. 18a). Low magnification FESEM images clearly depict the production of homogeneous MnS/rGO hybrids, in which the spherical MnS with diameters of about 3–5 μm are attached on the surface of rGO sheets (Fig. 18b and c). When magnifying the broken spheres, the hollow structure can be visualized (Fig. 18d) and it is further confirmed by the TEM observation shown in Fig. 18e. The electrochemical properties of MnS/rGO outperform single-phase MnS. In the first cycle, the discharge capacities of MnS/rGO and MnS are 1240 and 1178 mA h g−1 at a rate of 50 mA g−1, respectively (Fig. 18f). After 50 cycles, MnS/rGO shows a discharge capacity of about 500 mA h g−1, but the MnS only have ∼200 mA h g−1 (Fig. 18g). MnS/rGO also demonstrates much better rate performance than MnS, showing a higher discharge capacity at higher current densities (Fig. 18h). The improved electrochemical performance of MnS/rGO can be attributed to different aspects: (1) good electrical conductivity and flexibility of the rGO network to effectively buffer the volume change and alleviate the structural deformation during the lithium intercalation/deintercalation processes, which can be evidence from the Nyquist plot shown in Fig. 18i, and (2) the hollow and porous surface textures of MnS.

2.6 Molybdenum sulfides
MoS2 is a layered metal sulfide, in which the Mo–S atoms are covalently bonded and the adjacent layers are connected via van der Waals interactions. It is polytypic, which can be identified as naturally existing 2H-MoS2 and 3R-MoS2, as well as synthetic 1T-MoS2. In this regard, the 2H structure exists in the space group of P63/mmc (a = b = 3.16 Å, c = 12.29 Å),253 while the 3R structure belongs to the R3m space group (a = b = 3.16 Å and c = 18.37 Å),254 and the space group of metastable 1T-MoS2 is P1 (a = b = 3.36 Å, c = 6.29 Å).255 The unique 2D MoS2 has been employed as both anodes and cathodes for LIBs, and its theoretical capacity is estimated to be in the range of 167–669 mA h g−1 based on different reaction mechanisms at specific lithiation voltages. Although pre-lithiated MoS2 was patented as cathode in the 1980s, the low reaction voltage was a challenge to be overcome;256 hence, recently, MoS2 is mostly used as the anode in LIBs. Within 3.0 to 1.1 V, intercalation reaction occurs: MoS2 + xLi+ + xe− → LixMoS2 (∼1.1 V vs. Li/Li+, 0 ≤ x ≤ 1),257 giving rise to 167 mA h g−1. Moreover, the intercalation of Li+ induces lattice disruption of 2H-LixMoS2, leading to the phase conversion of MoS2 and transformation of the MoS6 unit from trigonal (2H-LixMoS2) to octahedral (1T-LixMoS2) prisms.253,258 Below a discharge voltage of 1.1 V, the conversion reaction: LixMoS2 + (4 − x)Li+ + (4 − x)e− → Mo + 2Li2S (∼0.6 V vs. Li/Li+) predominates and the theoretical capacity derived from both the intercalation and conversion reactions is 669 mA h g−1.259
Similar to graphite, the stacked parallel layers of bulk MoS2 are held in place by the weak van der Waals interactions. To completely exfoliate the few layers of MoS2, several top-down strategies were developed, e.g., the mechanical cleavage technique,260–262 electrochemical exfoliation,263 and liquid phase exfoliation.264–267 In the literature, single layer MoS2 was achieved by the scotch-tape-based mechanical exfoliation method from their bulk materials.268 Zeng et al.263 pre-lithiated MoS2 (LixMoS2) electrochemically to weaken their interlayer van der Waals forces before applying an agitation process in water or ethanol solvents. Different from most of the chemical exfoliation methods that involve both ion intercalation and solvent-based exfoliation steps, commercial MoS2 powder can also be exfoliated in a mixture of N-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP) and isopropanol (IPA) solvents which are able to weaken the interlayer van der Waals forces.264 Likewise, bottom-up methods such as hydrothermal/solvothermal techniques,269–271 colloidal synthesis,272,273 CVD,274,275 wetness impregnation276,277 and other templating methods278,279 can also be used to synthesize MoS2 nanostructures chemically. For instance, MoS2 hollow structures have been synthesized by Ye et al.280,281 and Wang et al.282 using a hydrothermal method. In a typical reaction, MoO3 and KSCN/NaSCN are used as the Mo and sulfur sources, respectively. During the synthesis process, K2NaMoO3F3 serving as the intermediate reacts with the S2− released from the SCN− upon hydrolysis to form MoS2. A colloidal wet chemistry method has also been employed to perform the controlled synthesis of MoS2, in which (NH4)2MoS4 was thermally decomposed in oleylamine solvent to form 2D MoS2 nanosheets.272 In addition, substantial efforts have been devoted to prepare MoS2via the gas phase reaction. Lee et al.274 discovered that rGO facilitates an homogeneous layer growth of MoS2 using the CVD method.
Much effort has also been devoted to tailor the (002) crystal plane of MoS2 to facilitate the lithium ion diffusion for LIB applications. For example, exfoliation can be executed through the ultrasonication of pre-lithiated MoS2 (LixMoS2) in aqueous solvent with the addition of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO).283 The electrochemical measurements (0.01–3.0 V vs. Li/Li+ at 50 mA g−1) reveal that the exfoliated MoS2 outperforms the pristine MoS2 by retaining more than 500 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles and preserving 95% of the coulombic efficiency in the second cycle. Hwang et al.269 demonstrated a solvothermal synthesis of MoS2 nanoplates (thicknesses: ∼30 nm) with expanded interlayer distances of 0.69 nm (0.62 nm for bulk MoS2) by reacting the organometallic Mo(Co)6 and sulfur in xylene at 250 °C for 24 h. Improved electrochemical performance could be observed by it showing high capacities of 917, 790 and 700 mA h g−1 after 20 cycles at very high current densities of 10.6, 31.9 and 53.1 A g−1, respectively. The reason behind this enhancement can be attributed to the larger lattice spacing that allows more and faster Li+ intercalation and maintains the reversibility of the electrochemical reactions. In addition, Liu et al.276 reported a vacuum-assisted impregnation method to synthesize high surface area-ordered mesoporous MoS2 using SBA-15 as the template. The obtained mesoporous MoS2 product also demonstrated an expanded d-spacing of the (002) plane (0.66 nm). Remarkably, such a mesoporous MoS2 electrode is able to deliver 876 and 608 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at rates of 0.1 and 10 A g−1, respectively. These results further validate the contribution of the expanded d-spacing of the (002) plane in providing faster lithium intercalation and render them as excellent electrochemical performers.
Hierarchical structures assembled by 2D MoS2 are also attractive for LIB anodes.284–286 For example, Sen et al.284 reported the hydrothermal synthesis of hierarchical MoS2 spheres. SEM images (Fig. 19a and b) illustrate a cauliflower morphology constructed by MoS2 nanowalls, and the TEM images (Fig. 19c–e) further reveal that an individual nanowall is the agglomerate of ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets with interlayer spacing of 0.62 nm. Fig. 19f shows the voltage profiles of hierarchical MoS2 spheres, which used cellulose (CMC) as a binder at different current densities. As illustrated in Fig. 19g, discharge capacities of 880, 737 and 676 mA h g−1 can be obtained at 100, 500 and 1000 mA g−1 after 50 cycles. The 3D hierarchical MoS2 structures endow them with a high accessible surface area, as well as a contact interface that contributes to the easy penetration of electrolyte. Moreover, the structural robustness facilitates the solid-state lithium-diffusion in the MoS2 matrix and buffers the mechanical strain induced during the repeated lithium insertion/extraction processes, leading to superior Li storage properties.

Furthermore, the hybridization approach can provide a synergistic effect in the electrochemical performance of MoS2. The presence of carbonaceous materials, such as graphene,287–290 CNTs,291,292 carbon fibres/clothes,293–295 and porous amorphous carbon,296–300 preserves the conductivity and greatly enhances the electron transport of the composite. In this regard, L-cysteine-assisted synthesis of layered MoS2/graphene composites was achieved by Chang et al.301 using a hydrothermal method. Specific capacities of 1100 and 900 mA h g−1 were obtained at current densities of 100 and 1000 mA g−1, respectively. This anode also showed almost no capacity fading after 100 cycles, indicating that its excellent cycling stability originated from the robust composite structure. In a study reported by Fu et al.,51 large-scale multilayered graphene/MoS2 could be produced by the in situ catalytic growth of MoS2 on sodium sulfate crystals using a simple annealing process. As depicted in Fig. 20a, the graphene layer is derived from the carbonization of the organic oleates molecules, and the Na2S produced from the reduction of the NaSO4 template induces a local CVD reaction to sulfurize the molybdenum oleate complex into MoS2. The TEM observation in Fig. 20b shows the high quality of the heterostructured film, and its SAED pattern (Fig. 20c) demonstrates the co-existence of MoS2 and few-layered graphene by the set of strong diffraction spots (labeled in a white color), accompanied by another set of weak diffraction spots (labeled in a yellow color). Individual graphene and MoS2 layers are estimated to be 1.6 and 1.2 nm, respectively, from the AFM analysis. As demonstrated in Fig. 20d, rational designed multi-layered graphene/MoS2 heterostructures are beneficial for the rapid transport of electrons and for the diffusion of lithium ions, while the graphene layer can improve the electronic conductivity of the composite and prevent adverse effects from the side-reactions between the MoS2 and electrolyte. As a result, graphene/MoS2 prepared at a 2:5 molar ratio of MoCl5 to sodium oleate (denoted as GM2) shows the best cycling performance, maintaining specific capacity of 1000 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 50 cycles (Fig. 20e). Moreover, it is able to achieve specific capacities of 990, 970, 930 and 820 mA h g−1 at current densities of 0.1, 0.5, 2.0 and 10 A g−1, respectively (Fig. 20f). Another interesting report is the unique hierarchical nanostructures of MoSx covered on the MWCNTs backbone (MoSx/MWCNTs) that was synthesized via a solvent thermal process.302Fig. 21a and b show the TEM and HRTEM images of MoSx coated on MWCNTs. Compared to the pristine MWCNTs, the specific capacity of the MoSx/MWCNTs is four times larger than the pristine MWCNTs electrode under a current density of 50 mA g−1. In addition, the MoSx/MWCNTs composite exhibits 1119, 904, 659, 358 and 197 mA h g−1 at current densities of 50, 200, 500, 1000 and 2000 mA g−1, respectively, and is able to rebound back to 1087 mA h g−1 when the current density is changed to 50 mA g−1. Taking advantage of the unique hierarchical nanoarchitecture of the MoSx/MWCNTs composite, the exposed MoSx provides sufficient contact with the lithium and the MWCNTs enhances the fast electronic conduction channels to preserve the electrical integrity of the composite (Fig. 21c). Moreover, coupling the MoS2 with TiO2 nanotubes can also make a prominent contribution to the excellent electrochemical performance.303

2.7 Tin sulfides
Tin sulfides have several binary compounds such as SnS, Sn2S3, Sn3S4, Sn4S5, and SnS2.304–306 Among these compounds, SnS and SnS2 are the most important ones, and have attracted considerable interest for their interesting properties and potential applications in energy storage devices, especially for LIBs.307–314 SnS, also called herzenbergite, has a strongly distorted NaCl structure with each tin atom located in a distorted octahedral coordination of six sulfur atoms. The 3D crystal structure is made up of orthorhombic unit cells consisting of double layers of tightly bound Sn–S atoms with van der Waals bonding between the layers.304–306 The initial lithiation of SnS exhibits a flat voltage plateau at around 1.2 V vs. Li/Li+, which is associated with the irreversible decomposition of SnS to Sn and Li2S (SnS + 2Li+ + 2e− → Sn + Li2S). Upon further lithiation at a more negative potential of ∼0.6 V vs. Li/Li+, there is a reversible alloying reaction of Sn with lithium (Sn + 4.4Li+ + 4.4e− ↔ Li4.4Sn), yielding a theoretical capacity of 781 mA h g−1.315,316 On the other hand, SnS2 crystallizes in the PbI2-layered structure with a hexagonal primitive unit cell, in which tin atoms are located in the octahedral sites and sandwiched between two hexagonally close-packed sulfur slabs.304–306 Adjacent sulfur layers are also bound by weak van der Waals interactions. The lithium storage mechanism of SnS2 was proposed to be: (1) SnS2 + 4Li+ + 4e− → Sn + 2Li2S, and (2) Sn + 4.4Li+ + 4.4e− ↔ Li4.4Sn. Similarly, the first step is irreversible, and may include much more complicated processes (voltage range: around 1.9–1.1 V vs. Li/Li+): SnS2 + xLi+ + xe− → LixSnS2, LixSnS2 + (y − x)Li+ + (y − x)e− → LiySnS2, and LiySnS2 + (4 − y)Li+ + (4 − y)e− → Sn + 2Li2S (0 < x < y ≤ 2).317–320 The second step (tin alloy/de-alloy) leads to a reversible theoretical capacity of 645 mA h g−1, and here Li2S acts as an inert matrix surrounding the Sn grains. Although both SnS and SnS2 show high initial discharge capacities, the capacity retention and rate capability need to be improved.
To date, various methods have been developed for the preparation of SnS nanomaterials with different morphologies, such as nanoparticles,310 nanorods,321,322 nanoneedles,323 rectangular nanosheets,324 nanoflowers,325 and yolk–shell nanospheres,326 for LIB anode applications. In 2010, Zhang et al.324 synthesized ultra-large single crystal SnS rectangular nanosheets (7 μm × 3 μm × 20 nm) by the thermal decomposition of a single-source precursor of Sn-diethyldithiocarbamate-1,10-phenanthroline in a mixture of oleylamine/1-octadecene. The obtained SnS nanosheets exhibited a capacity of 550 mA h g−1 during the fifth cycle in a voltage range of 3.0–0.01 V vs. Li/Li+ at 50 mA g−1. Vaughn et al.325 presented a simple solution-based synthesis of SnS nanoflowers containing hierarchically organized nanosheet subunits by heating SnI2, oleylamine-sulfide, and hexamethyldisilazane in oleylamine at 200 °C for 30 min. The charge–discharge characterization (1.1 to 0.01 V vs. Li/Li+, 50 mA g−1) showed a 2nd-discharge capacity of 600 mA h g−1 and maintained ∼580 mA h g−1 after 30 cycles. Recently, a new solid–liquid–gas–solid (SLGS) strategy was proposed by Cai et al.321 to grow porous SnS nanorods/carbon hybrids as anode materials. Briefly, a sulfur-containing resin (s-resin) laden with SnO2 nanoparticles was initially prepared by a solvothermal process and the subsequent calcination converted SnO2/s-resin precursor into porous SnS nanorods/carbon hybrids. Here, the s-resin plays an important role, and it can absorb tin cations and act as the nucleation sites for growing SnO2 nanocrystals owing to its macroreticular structure and sulfonic acid groups; moreover, it also serves as the carbon and sulfur source. Furthermore, the loading of SnS can be well controlled by changing the precursor ratios. The cycling stability tests (2.0 to 0.0 V vs. Li/Li+, 50 mA g−1) reveal that the porous SnS nanorods (38.2 wt%)/carbon have a higher reversible capacity with 466 mA h g−1 during the 50th cycle. In addition, a SnS yolk–shell structure with a stable cycling performance and superior rate capability was reported by Choi and Kang.326 Initially, the yolk–shell SnO2 was prepared by the spray pyrolysis method, whereby the subsequent sulfidation of SnO2 under H2S gas produced yolk–shell SnS (Fig. 22a). The obtained SnS characterized by TEM (Fig. 22b) shows clear double shells (thickness: ∼40 nm) and a single core (diameter: ∼200–300 nm). The dot-mapping image (Fig. 22c) indicates the uniform distribution of tin and sulfur elements in the yolk–shell structure. The galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements (Fig. 22d) between 1.0 and 0.001 V vs. Li/Li+ at a current density of 1 A g−1 display a second discharge capacity of 755 mA h g−1, and even deliver a capacity of 672 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles (capacity retention: 89%). Remarkably, the yolk–shell SnS can still deliver a capacity of 480 mA h g−1 at a very high current density of 5 A g−1 (Fig. 22e). Such excellent electrochemical performance is believed to be the result of its unique yolk–shell structure. The large void volume between the shell and core allows easy and complete penetration of the electrolyte into SnS and improves the structural stability of the active materials during repeated lithiation and delithiation processes.

Moreover, various nanostructured SnS2 anode materials, such as ultra-long nanobelts,327 hexagonal nanoplates,328–332 nanosheets,333 3D-hierarchical spheres/flowers assembled by nanoplates/nanosheets,311,334–336 have also been prepared. Owing to the anisotropic layered hexagonal structure of SnS2, it tends to grow into a 2D nanoplate/nanosheet morphology. A pioneering work of the preparation of 2D SnS2 was realized by Seo et al.332 in 2007. Hexagonal SnS2 nanoplates (Fig. 23a and b) with lateral sizes of ca. 150 nm and thicknesses of ca. 16 nm were synthesized by thermal decomposition of the precursor, Sn(S2CNEt2)4, in an organic oleylamine solvent at elevated temperature of 280 °C for 10 min. These unique nanoplates with confined lateral dimensions and enhanced open-edges allow easier accessibility of Li ions and transportation of electrons within the host matrix, as compared to the bulk counterparts (Fig. 23c), which resulted in a high 2nd-discharge capacity of 645 mA h g−1 (close to the theoretical capacity) between 1.1 and 0.001 V vs. Li/Li+ under a constant current of 323 mA g−1 (Fig. 23d). After the second cycle, the cycle-life performance was found to be fairly stable and delivered 583 mA h g−1 after 30 cycles (Fig. 23e). Although the following studies have achieved certain improvements on the capacity value and cyclability (e.g., 3D hierarchical SnS2 spheres336 show specific capacities of 771, 587 and 570 mA h g−1 at a rate of 650 mA g−1 during the 2nd, 50th and 100th cycles, respectively), the performance, especially at the high-C-rate, is still far from satisfactory (e.g., ultra-long SnS2 nanobelts327 deliver a low capacity of 273 mA h g−1 at 1.3 A g−1).

Combining SnS2 with a conducting carbonaceous matrix, such as amorphous carbon,337–339 CNTs,340,341 and graphene/rGO,49,307,320,342–351 has been proven to be an effective strategy to achieve high reversible capacities and long cycling life at high current densities. In particular, SnS2/graphene (or SnS2/rGO) hybrids were extensively investigated owing to the extraordinary properties of graphene.352–357 Specifically, two kinds of morphologies, i.e., ultrathin SnS2 nanocrystals (2–10 nm) and SnS2 nanoplate/nanosheet anchored on graphene, were prepared by hydrothermal or solvothermal method. For example, Yin et al.348 reported the synthesis of SnS2 nanocrystals (3–5 nm) on rGO sheets through a hydrothermal reaction. This hybrid (93.2 wt% SnS2 and 6.8 wt% rGO) delivered specific discharge capacities of 738, 619 and 564 mA h g−1 between 2.5 and 0.01 V (vs. Li/Li+) at 120 mA g−1 during the 2nd, 30th and 60th cycles, respectively. Furthermore, a capacity of 503 mA h g−1 at a relatively high rate of 1.2 A g−1 was obtained. Luo et al.351 developed a two-step strategy to fabricate a 2D SnS2 nanoplates/graphene (G–SnS2) hybrid by directly transforming tin oxide nanoparticles into SnS2 nanoplates on/between graphene nanosheets via a solution approach, followed by a CVD process. Notably, the lateral sizes of SnS2 nanoplates can be controlled by the pre-annealing of G–SnO2 precursor before CVD growth and by control of the flow rate of H2S–Ar gas. As a result, SnS2 nanoplates with lateral sizes of around 100, 200 and 500 nm were prepared, and marked as G–SnS2-S, G–SnS2-M and G-SnS2–L samples, respectively. The high-C-rate lithium storage measurements (1.3–0.005 V vs. Li/Li+) indicate that SnS2 nanoplates with larger lateral sizes display inferior rate performance; moreover, the best G–SnS2-S has reversible capacities of ca. 480, 375 and 230 mA h g−1 at current densities of 1.6, 3.2 and 6.4 A g−1, respectively. Chang et al.344 synthesized a 3D spherical architecture consisting of curved SnS2 and graphene nanosheets (SnS2/G) by treating L-cysteine (L-cys), GO and SnCl4·5H2O under a hydrothermal condition at 180 °C for 12 h (Fig. 24a). Here, L-cys was employed as a complexing sulfide source and as a reducing agent. The 3D morphology and microstructure of the SnS2/G hybrid are illustrated by SEM and TEM (Fig. 24b). The HRTEM image (Fig. 24c) shows that SnS2 nanosheets have thicknesses of 5 to 12 layers along with some defects. The cycling performance evaluation (1.5 to 0.01 V vs. Li/Li+, 100 mA g−1) displays a reversible capacity of around 920 mA h g−1 for SnS2/G without fading, while the bare SnS2 decreases quickly from ∼460 mA h g−1 (second cycle) to 163 mA h g−1 at the 50th cycle (Fig. 24d). Moreover, the SnS2/G hybrid also demonstrates an excellent rate capability (Fig. 24e). Even when increasing the current density to 1 A g−1, the capacity is still impressively high, i.e., 600 mA h g−1. The impressive electrochemical properties are probably because of the robust composite architecture that allows rapid lithium and electron transfer and the ability to withstand the stress upon cycling. Furthermore, in addition to carbonaceous materials, core–shell-structured SnS2@SiO2 nanorods358 also show promising lithium storage capabilities (e.g., about 400 mA h g−1 in the potential range of 0.01–1.15 V vs. Li/Li+ at a current density of 1.3 A g−1).

2.8 Other metal sulfides
Apart from the aforementioned candidates, metal sulfides, such as WS2,359–368 In2S3,369–378 Sb2S3,52,379–382 Bi2S3,383–387 TiS2,388–390 GeS2 (ref. 391) and VS2,392,393 are also attractive host materials for LIBs and SCs by electrochemically reacting with a wide variety of guest ions to store energies.
WS2, a naturally occurring metal sulfide, has the same crystal structure as MoS2 (hexagonal structure, space group P63/mmc), which possesses 2D covalently bonded S–W–S layers separated by a van der Waals gap. It has a theoretical specific capacity of 433 mA h g−1 based on 4 mol of lithium insertion/extraction for LIB application. A few attempts have been made to investigate the lithium storage activities of WS2 nanoelectrodes.359–366 Earlier work on the synthesis of WS2 nanotubes was performed by sintering the amorphous WS3 at a high temperature under flowing hydrogen.359 The obtained WS2 nanotubes demonstrate a stable cyclability (ca. 600 mA h g−1) in a wide voltage range (3.1–0.1 V vs. Li/Li+). After this work, several other nanostructured WS2-based anodes, such as nanoflakes (by a rheological phase reaction),360 ordered mesoporous rod-like particles (by the SBA-15 template method),361 graphene-like morphology (by the solid-state reaction),362 nanosheets (by exfoliation),363 and few-layer WS2/graphene composites,364–366 were also reported. One of the most promising studies is the preparation of nitrogen-doped graphene and few-layer WS2 (WS2–NG) via a facile surfactant (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, CTAB)-assisted approach under hydrothermal treatment (Fig. 25a).364 Three composites, namely, WS2–NG1, WS2–NG2 and WS2–NG5, were produced with different surfactant/precursor ratios of 1:2, 2:2, and 5:2, respectively. All the samples had a curved leaf-like appearance, and WS2 sheets with several layers were uniformly embedded on the NG surface (Fig. 25b and c for WS2–NG2). The electrochemical behaviours of WS2 are evaluated by CV scanning in the voltage window of 3.0–0.0 V vs. Li/Li+ at a rate of 0.1 mV s−1 (Fig. 25d). A weak reduction peak around 1.5 V (vs. Li/Li+) during the initial cathodic scanning can be attributed to the lithium insertion into the interlayer space of WS2 to form LixWS2. A subsequent strong reduction peak at 0.5 V (vs. Li/Li+) corresponds to the conversion reaction of LixWS2 + (4 − x)Li+ + (4 − x)e− → W + 2Li2S, accompanied by the irreversible decomposition of the electrolyte. The peak at 2.39 V (vs. Li/Li+) during the following anodic scanning is associated with the reversible lithium extraction reaction. However, there is a lack of consensus on the mechanism of oxidation process. Fang et al.362 proposed that the metallic W cannot be oxidized up to 3.0 V (vs. Li/Li+) and that Li2S and S are the only redox couple in the cell (S + 2Li+ + 2e− ↔ Li2S) on the basis of XRD and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) results. However, the theoretical capacity for WS2 is calculated to be only 216 mA h g−1 according to this redox reaction, which is much less than the practical reversible capacity of ca. 590 mA h g−1. It is thus speculated that the oxidized sulfur phase may appear as a by-product, and the oxidation of metallic W is involved in the charge process. The galvanostatic charge–discharge tests (current density: 100 mA g−1) exhibit 2nd-discharge capacities of 838, 905 and 734 mA h g−1 for WS2–NG1, WS2–NG2 and WS2–NG5, respectively, which have no significant degradation after cycling up to 100 times. Furthermore, they also show an excellent high-C-rate performance, e.g., the WS2–NG2 electrode retains ∼700 mA h g−1 (80% of the capacity at 100 mA g−1) at the high rate of 5 A g−1 (Fig. 25e). In addition to the enhanced electrical conductivity by NG sheets, the integration of few-layer WS2 and NG can provide for the efficient transport of electrons and lithium ions through the composite, and it can buffer the volume expansion, and thus alleviate the dissolution of polysulfides.

On the other hand, WS2 can also serve as the active material for SC applications. Ratha et al.367 reported SC electrodes based on 2D WS2 sheets and few-layer WS2 sheets/rGO hybrids (WS2/rGO) prepared by a simple hydrothermal method. The CV curves (Fig. 25f) of WS2/rGO electrode shows humps, which can be ascribed to the possible redox reaction of WS2 + Na+ + e− ↔ WS–Na+. From the CV at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1, a capacitance of 350 F g−1 is obtained for WS2/rGO, whereas rGO and WS2 sheets have capacitances of only 130 and 70 F g−1, respectively (Fig. 25g). The galvanostatic charge/discharge at various current densities gives specific capacitances of about 350, 250 and 200 F g−1 for WS2/rGO at rates of 0.5, 1.5 and 9 A g−1, respectively. Moreover, the WS2/rGO hybrid shows a stable cycling performance without capacitance fading, even after 1000 cycles at 3 A g−1 (Fig. 25h). As seen from the last five cycles of charge/discharge (Fig. 25i), the curves still show a symmetric shape, indicating its high reversibility. The superior capacitive performance of the WS2/rGO hybrid is believed to be the result of the high electrical conductivity endowed by the composite and homogenous coverage of the thin-layered WS2 sheets on rGO surfaces, which facilitates the rapid transport of the electrolyte ions and increases the electrochemical utilization of WS2. Furthermore, Hu et al.368 fabricated a novel SC electrode of WS2 nanoparticles encapsulated in amorphous carbon tubes (WS2NPs/CTs) via a two-step process: hydrothermal carbonization of glucose to form CTs in the presence of an anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) template film and subsequent heat treatment of a (NH4)2WS4-impregnated CTs/AAO film. It was found that such a composite could deliver a specific capacitance of 337 F g−1 at a high current density of 10 A g−1 with good cycle stability.
In2S3, a typical III–VI main-group chalcogenide, occurs in three different crystallographic forms: a defective cubic structure α-In2S3, a defect spinel structure β-In2S3 and a higher-temperature-layered structure γ-In2S3. Apart from being an important alternative buffer layer to CdS for Cu(In,Ga)Se2-based solar cells,394 In2S3 can also be employed as a promising anode material for storing large amounts of Li (theoretical capacity: 1205 mA h g−1) based on the electrochemical reactions of In2S3 + 6Li+ + 6e− → 2In + 3Li2S and In + xLi+ + xe− → LixIn (0 < x ≤ 4.33).369–371,395 However, the reversible delithiation is very difficult, especially for the first conversion reaction, leading to small practical capacities. To improve the kinetics of lithium transfer and alleviate the electrode pulverization, various In2S3 nanostructures, including nanoflakes,371 nanosheets,372 flower-like microspheres,373 1D Ag@In2S3 composite,374 and In2S3/graphene hybrids,375–378 have been fabricated. For example, mono-dispersed flower-like In2S3 microspheres with average diameters of 1.5 μm (Fig. 26a and b) were synthesized by a one-step solvothermal process. The sample exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 1150 mA h g−1 and a charge capacity of 302 mA h g−1 between 0.01 and 3.00 V (vs. Li/Li+) at 100 mA g−1, which decreases to below 100 mA h g−1 after 10 cycles.373 In the presence of a carbon layer, the capacity can be stabilized at ∼360 mA h g−1 at the 50th cycle. In2S3 nanosheets (surface area: 69.2 m2 g−1) fabricated through a facile solution route show an initial charge capacity of ∼800 mA h g−1, and retain 450 mA h g−1 after 40 cycles under a relatively high charge/discharge rate of 700 mA g−1.372 In2S3 nanosheets coaxially grown on Ag nanowires (Ag@In2S3, Fig. 26c and d), was also reported.374 This composite displays improved capacities and cyclability, e.g., 700, 550 and 470 mA h g−1 at current densities of 200, 700 and 1000 mA g−1, respectively. Such a heterostructure is believed to have improved charge transport and mechanical durability upon prolonged cycling. Furthermore, incorporation of graphene with In2S3 not only boosts the reversible capacity but also improves the cycle life.375–378 Ye et al.376 produced a sheet-on-sheet reduced graphene oxide–In2S3 (rGO–In2S3) composite (Fig. 26e) via a one-step mild method. This composite showed an initial reversible discharge capacity of 1072 mA h g−1 at a rate of 100 mA g−1, which is much higher than that of pure In2S3 (775 mA h g−1). After 100 cycles, the rGO–In2S3 could still obtain 1015 mA h g−1, whereas the capacity of pure In2S3 fades quickly to 415 mA h g−1 (Fig. 26f), indicating the essential role of rGO sheets in the enhancement of lithium storage properties of In2S3.

Stibnite, i.e., Sb2S3, possessing a layered cluster structure composed of zig-zag Sb–S–Sb chains along the a–c plane (orthorhombic, space group Pbnm),396 is also regarded as a prospective anode material for LIBs. The electrochemical reaction of Sb2S3 toward Li undergoes conversion and alloying reactions: Sb2S3 + 6Li+ + 6e− → 2Sb + 3Li2S, and Sb + 3Li+ + 3e− → Li3Sb.379 These two reactions give a theoretical capacity of 946 mA h g−1. During the delithiation process, it is, however, found that the alloying reaction is fully reversible, while the conversion reaction is irreversible or partly reversible if the structure and morphology of Sb2S3 are controlled properly, which makes the practical capacity much less than the theoretical value of 946 mA h g−1.379–381 In order to increase the reversible utilization of Sb2S3, several nanostructures were synthesized.52,379–382 For example, Ma et al.382 reported the synthesis of Sb2S3 with morphologies of 1D nanorods, 2D nanowire bundles, 3D sheaf-like superstructures, dumbbell-shaped superstructures, and urchin-like microspheres under hydrothermal conditions with a combination of ionic liquid and other additives. The electrochemical lithiation results show that these nanostructures have similar capacities of approximately 1100, 700 and 400 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 during the 1st, 2nd and 25th cycles, respectively. Prikhodchenko et al.52 adopted a new synthesis method to produce rGO-supported Sb2S3 nanocrystals (15–20 nm), which exhibit a reversible specific capacity of over 720 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at a current density of 250 mA g−1. Recently, Zhou et al.381 synthesized a composite of Sb2S3/C nanorods by a L-cysteine-assisted solvothermal reaction, which displayed a remarkably improved performance. The obtained Sb2S3/C demonstrated a high reversible specific capacity of 1084 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1, and maintained 960 mA h g−1 after 30 cycles.
Bi2S3 with a lamellar structure can store lithium through conversion and alloying reactions (Bi2S3 + 12Li+ + 12e− → 3Li2S + 2Li3Bi), yielding a theoretical capacity of 625 mA h g−1. In 2008, Zhou et al.383 found that Bi2S3 urchin-like microspheres and microflowers can react with lithium and show first discharge capacities as high as 770 and 810 mA h g−1 with a cut-off voltage window of 0.0–3.0 V (vs. Li/Li+) at a current density of 0.032 mA cm−2. The excess capacity over the theoretical value is attributed to the irreversible formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the surface of the electrode.45,397,398 After that, Jung et al.384 produced a Bi2S3/C nanocomposite by a high-energy mechanical milling technique. The electrochemical mechanisms during the first cycle were also investigated using ex situ XRD patterns and HRTEM images with fast Fourier transform. The results reveal that, during the charging process, the delithiation product is not merely Bi2S3, but also involves the bismuth phase, indicating that the capacity is less than the theoretical value of 625 mA h g−1. The Bi2S3/C electrode shows first discharge and charge capacities of 747 and 576 mA h g−1 at a rate of 100 mA g−1, respectively. After 100 cycles, a capacity of 490 mA h g−1 is achieved, corresponding to 85% of the first charge capacity. Zhang et al.387 developed a simple one-pot hydrothermal route to synthesize Bi2S3/rGO composite, which demonstrated initial discharge and charge capacities of 1073 and 791 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1, respectively. Even at a high rate of 1 A g−1, the Bi2S3/rGO electrode could still reach a capacity of 290 mA h g−1.
Furthermore, TiS2, GeS2 and VS2 have also shown attractive electrochemical characteristics. Kartick et al.390 reported that the TiS2–MWCNT hybrid anode can deliver an initial specific capacity of ∼450 mA h g−1 with 80% capacity retention after 50 cycles between 0.01 and 3.0 V (vs. Li/Li+) at a current density of 100 mA g−1. Kim et al.391 evaluated the lithium storage capability of GeS2 glass in the voltage window of 0.0–1.5 V (vs. Li/Li+) at a rate of 134 mA g−1. The first discharge and charge capacities were 1417 and 446 mA h g−1, respectively. Although the irreversible capacity loss for the first cycle was large, GeS2 glass showed improved cyclability by retaining 93% of its capacity retention after 30 cycles. The density functional theory computations carried out by Jing et al.392 found that a VS2 monolayer anode can stably adsorb lithium up to Li2VS2, yielding a theoretical capacity of 466 mA h g−1, and also has a low average open circuit voltage of 0.93 V (vs. Li/Li+). Moreover, Feng et al.393 developed a unique ammonia-assisted strategy to exfoliate bulk VS2 flakes into ultrathin VS2 nanosheets stacked with less than five S–V–S single layers (Fig. 27a). Based on the advantages of high conductivity and high specific area, the as-exfoliated VS2 ultrathin nanosheets can be assembled into transferrable thin films on a mixed cellulose membrane by vacuum filtration (Fig. 27a), and then investigated as electrodes for SCs in an in-plane configuration (Fig. 27b). A specific capacitance of 317 F cm−3 is achieved at a rate of 0.1 A cm−2 for the in-plane SC (Fig. 27c), of which no obvious degradation is observed even after 1000 charge/discharge cycles (Fig. 27d).

3. Summary and perspectives
In summary, this review aims at casting light on recent advances in the design and fabrication of nanostructured MS electrodes for LIBs and SCs, as summarized in Tables 2 and 3 The recent developments in nanoscience and technology have brought about a great leap in energy storage systems. In particular, nanostructured MSs endowed with high surface areas can provide abundant accessible reaction sites for charge storage, can facilitate electron/ion transport, enhance the electrolyte diffusion, and can alleviate the impacts of structural deformation upon lithium insertion/extraction Furthermore, the concept of the incorporation of carbonaceous matrices, such as CNTs and graphenes with nanostructured MSs, has been a resounding success for achieving energy storage devices with higher efficiencies. Currently, although some significant advances have been achieved, the development of next-generation LIB and SC electrodes based on MS nanostructures is still at the early stage, but the outlook for the future is highlighted herein.

To realize the future promise of widespread industrial applications, a simple, reliable, cheap, less wasteful synthetic approach for achieving the large-scale production of MS nanostructures is needed. Furthermore, the trend of using earth-abundant and non-toxic raw materials and green manufacturing processes has to be established to guarantee that the development in energy storage devices proceeds without compromising on the cost effectiveness and environmental issues. As the development of MS nanoelectrodes is progressing towards the ultimate goals of high energy and power densities, a revolution in material design is required to make full utilization of the active materials, even at ultrafast charge/discharge rates. In addition, the engineering of 3D current collectors to support MS nanostructures may require a unique architecture that enables ease of electrolyte penetration to ensure the ions are accessible to regions far beyond the surface. Apart from the material itself, the selection of counter electrodes, electrolytes and packaging is also crucial in realizing the full potential of the MS SCs and noteworthy investigations need to be made. For future prospects, further breakthroughs in this field may also lie in the fundamental understanding of the relationship between the MS nanostructures and their electrochemical characteristics (e.g., the kinetics of electron/ion transport at the electrode/electrolyte interface), which is critical for the future optimization of the synthesis parameters and material properties.
