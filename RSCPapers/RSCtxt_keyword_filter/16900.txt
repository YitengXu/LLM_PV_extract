    , Accepted 11th September 2017First published on 12th September 2017AbstractWe have developed a simple yet versatile approach for enhancing the performance of all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) using a highly crystalline small-molecular additive, 6,6′-dithiopheneisoindigo (DTI). The DTI additive in a blend of PTB7-Th donor and P(NDI2HD-T) acceptor enhances the power conversion efficiency of all-PSCs from 5.9 to 6.8%. Based on the analyses of the electrical, optical, and structural properties of all-PSCs, it is suggested that DTI additives promote tighter π–π packing and larger sizes of crystalline domains. Such morphological changes of the PTB7-Th:P(NDI2HD-T) blend films upon the addition of DTI enhance the exciton lifetime and diffusion length, which are proved by static and femtosecond-transient absorption spectroscopies and time-resolved photoluminescence. As a result of improved exciton dissociation probability and charge transport, the short-circuit current density of all-PSCs is greatly increased. Importantly, we also show that the DTI additive can be applied to other all-PSC systems with different polymer donors and naphthalene diimide (NDI)-based polymer acceptors, where the efficiencies of all-PSCs are enhanced by 10–20%.
Introduction
Recently, all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), consisting of polymer donors and polymer acceptors, have shown great progress and potential as an energy source in high-performance flexible devices. In particular, all-PSCs have advantages over conventional fullerene-polymer solar cells (fullerene-PSCs) such as tunable energy levels, higher light-harvesting ability, mechanical flexibility, and thermal stability.1–17 Despite these advantages, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all-PSCs are still lower than those of fullerene-PSCs.18–21 The unoptimized blend morphology in the active layer caused by strong immiscibility between long polymer chains,22,23 lower electron mobility of polymer acceptors than those of fullerene derivatives,7 and inefficient generation of free charge carriers24–26 are identified as main features limiting the performance of all-PSCs. In particular, the exciton dissociation efficiency and charge transport strongly depend on the crystallinity and molecular orientation of polymer donors and acceptors within the blend films.24–26 Therefore, developing new approaches to attain an optimized blend morphology with well-ordered packing structures and desired orientations of polymers is an urgent and important requirement for improving the electrical properties and the PCEs of all-PSCs.15,22–24,26–28
Different methods such as tuning the molecular weight15,26,29 and side-chain structure of polymers30–36 and/or controlling the processing conditions during the active layer formation have been reported to optimize the blend morphology of the PSCs.37–42 Among several approaches, introducing solvent additives has been successfully considered as a facile strategy for enhancing the PCE of all-PSCs, because it can effectively tune the blend morphology with enhanced crystalline behavior of polymers without involving any complex synthesis of new materials.40,41,43,44 Moreover, it has been recently reported that the incorporation of highly crystalline small molecules as the additive could further enhance the photovoltaic performance of fullerene-PSCs.45–47 For instance, the addition of a small molecule, p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, into poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl] (PTB7-Th)-based fullerene-PSCs improved the hole mobility, increasing the PCE from 9.2 to 10.5%.45 This was because a small amount of molecular additives was mixed into the phase of the polymer donor and facilitated the formation of a preferential face-on crystalline structure of polymers. Similarly, the incorporation of small molecules led to increased PCEs of fullerene-PSCs due to the enhancement in the crystallinity of polymer donors.46 Thus, the use of highly crystalline small-molecular additives could provide an alternative solution to overcome the limitations of inefficient free charge carrier generation and charge transport in all-PSCs by controlling the polymer packing structures and the active layer morphology.
In this study, we described the development of a crystalline small-molecular additive to optimize the blend morphology and crystalline packing structures of polymers, and thereby to enhance the performance of all-PSCs. 6,6′-Dithiopheneisoindigo (DTI) was chosen and synthesized as a small-molecular additive because the extension of the conjugation by thiophene at the 6,6′ positions of the isoindigo ring could afford highly crystalline structures in the solid state.48–51 We incorporated the DTI small-molecular additive into the all-PSC active layer of PTB7-Th as the donor and poly[[N,N′-bis(2-hexyldecyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-thiophene] (P(NDI2HD-T)) as the acceptor (Fig. 1). A small amount of DTI induced tight polymer packing structures with increased coherence length of polymer crystalline domains without causing significant phase separation in the active blend layer. The enhanced crystallinity of polymer blends led to an improvement in the charge transport ability and the efficiency of exciton dissociation probability. Since DTI has a large bandgap, it is anticipated to inhibit photo-induced charge transfer with either the polymer donor or the polymer acceptor, which allows for tuning the structural and electrical properties of the devices without VOC loss. As a result, the addition of 10 wt% of DTI exhibited significant enhancement in the PCE from 5.90 to 6.81%. We also demonstrated that the DTI additive can be applied in various all-PSC systems based on other polymers, such as poly[(2,5-bis(2-hexyldecyloxy)phenylene)-alt-(5,6-difluoro-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole)] (PPDT2FBT) as a donor and poly[[N,N′-bis(2-hexyldecyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-selenophene] (P(NDI2HD-Se)) and poly[[N,N′-bis(2-hexyldecyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)] (P(NDI2HD-T2)) as acceptors.15,30,36 All of the all-PSC systems exhibited significant enhancements in the PCEs by 10 to 18% compared with the devices without DTI.

Results and discussion
The chemical structures and energy level diagram of the polymer donors (PTB7-Th and PPDT2FBT), small-molecular additive (DTI), and polymer acceptors (P(NDI2HD-T), P(NDI2HD-T2), and P(NDI2HD-Se)) are displayed in Fig. 1. Microwave-assisted one-step synthesis was carried out between dibrominated isoindigo (1 equiv.) and stannylated thiophene (2 equiv.), which afforded the DTI. The chemical structure and purity of DTI were confirmed by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) analysis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (Fig. S1† and the Experimental section). In addition, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were determined to be −5.68 and −3.67 eV, respectively, by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement (Fig. 1b and S2†). Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurement for DTI showed a highly ordered structure with multiple peaks (q, q, q, etc.) along the in-plane and out-of-plane directions and a π–π stacking peak appeared at 37° tilted away from the substrate normal (Fig. S3†).49,51
Next, we investigated the effects of DTI additives on the performance of all-PSCs using PTB7-Th and P(NDI2HD-T) as the polymer donor and polymer acceptor, respectively. The inverted-type all-PSCs consisting of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag were fabricated, in which different weight ratios (10–50 wt%) of DTI relative to the total weight of donor and acceptor polymers were introduced. Fig. 2a shows the J–V curves and Table 1 summarizes the photovoltaic parameters of the all-PSCs depending on the DTI weight ratio. The reference device of the PTB7-Th:P(NDI2HD-T) blend showed a PCE value of 5.90%, which was comparable with our previously reported PCEs.34 Interestingly, when 10 wt% of DTI was added into the reference device, the JSC value increased drastically from 13.8 to 15.4 mA cm−2 without affecting VOC. As a result, the PCE value dramatically increased from 5.90 to 6.81%, which is more than a 15% enhancement as compared with the PCE of the reference device. Although the JSC and PCE values of the all-PSCs were slightly reduced by adding 30 wt% DTI, they were still higher than those of the reference device. Finally, upon the addition of an excess amount of DTI (i.e., 50 wt%), the PCE value significantly reduced with a concomitant decrease of the JSC and FF. Thus, the PCE and JSC values of the all-PSCs displayed a similar trend as a function of the amount of DTI additives (Fig. 2b), suggesting that JSC was the major contributor to the improved device performance. Fig. 2c shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the all-PSCs. It was observed that the incorporation of 10 wt% of DTI enhanced the EQE values over the whole spectral range. In accordance with the JSC trend with different weight ratios of DTI, further increasing the DTI content to 30 wt% led to slightly reduced EQE values, while the values were still higher than those of the reference device (Table 1). Notably, the EQE values near 450 nm, at which DTI had maximum absorption, were seldom increased when 10 to 30 wt% of DTI was added (Fig. 2c and S4†), indicating that the absorption from DTI molecules did not contribute to the enhancement in the JSC values. Therefore, we speculated that the increased JSC values were mainly attributed to the changes in electrical properties.

To prove our hypothesis that the enhancement in JSC with the addition of DTI in the all-PSCs is not attributed to the absorption of DTI molecules, we performed femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS).52,53 Exciton and charge dynamics in the neat PTB7-Th, neat DTI, and PTB7-Th:DTI binary blends were measured to investigate charge or exciton transfer between the DTI and the donor polymer. The exciton dynamics in the spectral range from 0.80 to 1.55 eV were assessed after exciting the samples using 405 nm (3.06 eV) pump pulses (Fig. S5†). The PTB7-Th and DTI pristine films exhibited clear exciton photo-induced absorption features at 0.87 and 1.08 eV, respectively (Fig. S5a and b†). Interestingly, the exciton dynamics of PTB7-Th (Fig. S5c†) did not show notable changes upon the addition of DTI, which demonstrated that there was no charge or exciton transfer between DTI and the polymer. This observation is supported by the relative positions of energy levels and photoluminescence (PL) properties of PTB7-Th, DTI, and P(NDI2HD-T) (Fig. 1b and S6†). Because DTI has a large energy bandgap with a HOMO of −5.68 eV and a LUMO of −3.67 eV, DTI would not be able to contribute to photo-induced charge transfer with either PTB7-Th or P(NDI2HD-T). This is partly evidenced by the negligible photovoltaic performance of both the binary blends of PTB7-Th:DTI and P(NDI2HD-T):DTI (Table S1†).54 In addition, the PL emission spectrum of DTI had very weak intensity in the range from 550 to 950 nm, where both PTB7-Th and P(NDI2HD-T) showed high absorbance. This feature suggests that the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from DTI to either PTB7-Th or P(NDI2HD-T) hardly occurs.
To investigate how the incorporation of DTI into all-PSC blends improved JSC and the resulting PCE values, crystalline structures of blend films with varied DTI contents were examined using GIWAXS measurements. Fig. 3 shows the two-dimensional GIWAXS images of the all-polymer blend films and their corresponding linecut plots. As shown in Fig. 3b and c, the PTB7-Th:P(NDI2HD-T) blend film showed a distinct (100) lamellar peak along the in-plane direction at qxy = 0.27 Å−1 and a π–π stacking (010) peak in the out-of-plane direction at qz = 1.62 Å−1, indicating that polymers had face-on structures. When the DTI additive was added into the all-PSC blend, the π–π stacking distance reduced from 3.9 to 3.7 Å (Table 2). Furthermore, the coherence length of the π–π stacked crystallite of blend films calculated by the Scherrer equation55 gradually increased from 17.0 to 23.3 Å upon the addition of DTI, which showed that the presence of DTI small-molecular additives induced a more extended π orbital overlap and tightly-packed face-on oriented crystalline structures. However, a distinguishable peak was observed at qz = 0.41 Å−1 when more than 30 wt% DTI was incorporated (Fig. 3c). An additional peak originated from (100) scattering of DTI aggregates as shown in Fig. S3.† This could be explained by morphological changes measured by atomic force microscope (AFM) (Fig. S7†). Addition of more than 30 wt% DTI caused increased root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness (1.2 nm) compared with that of the reference blend film (0.4 nm). In particular, the 50 wt% DTI blend film exhibited a much larger roughness of 6.3 nm, indicating that a strong phase separation of DTI occurred. The excessive phase separation by the addition of a high wt% (>30 wt%) of DTI molecules might hinder efficient charge transport in thin films, causing adverse influence on the device performance as observed in Fig. 2. However, the formation of DTI aggregates in the blend was suppressed at below 30 wt% of DTI, suggesting that DTI molecules were present within the PTB7-Th and P(NDI2HD-T) domains.

To elucidate the role of DTI additives on the polymer structure and the miscibility between polymers and DTIs, we investigated the crystalline structure of each pristine polymer film with different DTI wt%. As shown in Fig. S8,† the P(NDI2HD-T) pristine films had face-on oriented crystalline packing structures: a lamellar (100) peak at qxy = 0.28 Å−1 and a π–π stacking (010) peak at qz = 1.53 Å−1. When the DTI ratio was increased from 0 to 30%, the π–π stacking distance reduced from 4.1 to 3.9 Å (Table S2†), although no significant change in the diffraction pattern was observed. When the DTI ratio was further increased to 50 wt%, the lamellar (100) peak of DTI molecules at qz = 0.41 Å−1 was noticeably observed. The DTI additive had the same effect on PTB7-Th pristine films: the π–π stacking distance reduced from 3.9 to 3.7 Å by adding DTI (Fig. S9 and Table S2†). However, PTB7-Th did not exhibit any diffraction peak from DTI up to 50 wt% DTI, indicating that DTI molecules are well-dispersed within PTB7-Th domains.
The enhanced crystalline properties of PTB7-Th:P(NDI2HD-T) via the addition of DTI are also supported by the changes in absorption spectra. As shown in Fig. S10,† the absorption of the blend films was red-shifted from 708 to 721 nm by adding 10 wt% of DTI, which was likely due to an improvement in polymer packing and intermolecular coupling.56,57 The red-shifted absorption peak was consistently observed in polymer blends with higher wt% of DTI molecules (Fig. S10a and c†). This red-shift in the absorption is not associated with the absorption of the DTI molecules (Fig. S4†) because the bandgap of DTI is significantly larger than those of both PTB7-Th and P(NDI2HD-T). Since the vibronic structures of the polymers (PTB7-Th) were typically associated with the well-ordered, tightly packed regions in the film, we performed a quantitative analysis for the absorption spectra of PTB7-Th:DTI binary blend films. Clark et al. reported that the ratio, R = A0–0/A0–1, of the absorption from the 0–0 and 0–1 vibronic replicas is an estimation of the interchain coupling strength, which impacts excited state delocalization.56 Specifically, the higher absorption of the 0–0 peak in comparison to 0–1 of PTB7-Th pristine films indicates J-aggregation and stronger interchain electronic coupling. With 10 wt% of DTI, the R value increased from 1.15 to 1.20 with a 9 nm-red-shifted 0–0 absorption peak (λ0–0) from 705 nm of the PTB7-Th pristine film. When a greater amount of DTI (30 wt%) was incorporated into the PTB7-Th:P(NDI2HD-T) blend films, the 0–0 absorption peak was red-shifted by 16 nm and R increased to 1.28, which indicated significantly improved interchain coupling and exciton delocalization, resulting from tightly packed crystalline structures of the polymers.
Furthermore, the enhancement in electronic properties is apparent in the exciton lifetime, which was measured using time-resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL). Fig. S11† shows the TR-PL of PTB7-Th with the addition of 0–20 wt% of DTI at an excitation of 1.77 eV. Interestingly, the exciton lifetime increased from 0.20 ns for the PTB7-Th pristine film to 0.26 ns with the addition of 10 wt% DTI. A similar lifetime improvement with increased polymer packing and aggregation was reported for P3HT films with varying regioregularity.57 P(NDI2HD-T) exhibited similar trends in exciton lifetime (excitation of 3.31 eV) to PTB7-Th upon the addition of DTI (Fig. S11c and d†). Therefore, the addition of DTI influenced the exciton lifetime and exciton delocalization, enhancing the JSC and PCE values of the all-PSCs.
The importance of tuning the polymer packing structure in promoting efficient exciton dissociation as well as charge transport ability has been well-demonstrated.7,23–26 Therefore, we assessed the effects of the enhanced polymer packing structures by the addition of DTI on the charge transport and recombination properties. Table S3 and Fig. S12† show the electron mobility (μe) and hole mobility (μh) values measured by the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method. When 10 wt% DTI was incorporated into PTB7-Th:P(NDI2HD-T), both μh and μe were increased by a factor of 2–3 from 1.2 × 10−4 to 3.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for holes and 5.3 × 10−5 to 1.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for electrons.
Then, the charge recombination behavior under open-circuit and short-circuit conditions was examined by measuring the J–V characteristics depending on light intensity (P).6,30,58 The linear–log plot of VOC and log–log plot of JSC curves depending on P are presented in Fig. 4a and S13,† respectively. The light dependent JSC values of the all-PSCs as a function of the amount of DTI additives were fitted with the power law. The slope values (α) of the PTB7-Th:P(NDI2HD-T) blend device with the 10–30 wt% addition of DTI were higher than that (0.87) of PTB7-Th:P(NDI2HD-T) without DTI, showing that bimolecular recombination was suppressed by the addition of DTI. In general, the VOC depends on the natural logarithm of P with the slope (S) expressed in units of kBTq−1 (where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and q is the elementary charge). The S value is close to kBTq−1 when bimolecular recombination is the dominant loss mechanism of charges in devices.58 As shown in Fig. 4a, the presence of 10 wt% of DTI significantly decreased the S values close to unity (1.01). In addition, when the amount of DTI was increased to 20–50 wt%, the S values were still lower than that of the reference device, indicating that the morphological changes induced by the addition of DTI suppressed geminate recombination. Importantly, the geminate recombination properties were also correlated with the exciton dissociation probability (P(E,T)), which could be calculated by measuring the photocurrent (Jph).58,59 As shown in Fig. 4b, when 10 wt% of DTI was added, the P(E,T) value substantially increased from 73 to 83%. Thus, we concluded that the reduced geminate recombination by a small addition of DTI increased the number of dissociated free charge carriers, resulting in a significant enhancement in the JSC. However, when a large amount of DTI was added, excessive phase separation of DTI from the polymer blends occurred, giving rise to inferior P(E,T) and charge transport properties.

To demonstrate the versatility of the DTI additive, the DTI additive was applied to other all-PSC systems with different polymer donors and acceptors. P(NDI2HD-Se) and P(NDI2HD-T2) were utilized as polymer acceptors and PPDT2FBT was selected as a polymer donor (Fig. 1a). Fig. 5 summarizes the PCE and JSC values of different all-PSC systems. The PCE values in the all-PSCs were significantly enhanced by the addition of DTI (10–18% enhancement) due to the improved JSC values (Table 3), which was consistent with the observations from the PTB7-Th:P(NDI2HD-T) system. Both the PCE and JSC values of all-PSC systems consisting of PTB7-Th as the donor and two acceptors, P(NDI2HD-Se) and P(NDI2HD-T2), were increased by 10–15% upon 10 wt% addition of DTI. And the 18% enhanced PCE compared with the reference device was achieved via 10 wt% addition of DTI in the PPDT2FBT:P(NDI2HD-T)-based PSCs.

In addition, the stability of the all-PSCs with the addition of DTI was examined as a function of annealing time at 150 °C, which served as an accelerated test of long-term stability (Fig. S14†).60–62 The PTB7-Th:P(NDI2HD-T) blend films without DTI and with 10 wt% addition of DTI were thermally annealed for different times at 150 °C in a N2 atmosphere prior to deposition of the MoO3/Ag top electrode to exclude the influence of other factors on the thermal stability of the active layer morphology such as degradation of the interlayer or the electrode. The reference all-PSC device without DTI maintained 86% of its initial PCE after 48 h of annealing, which is consistent with our recent observation.16 Interestingly, the all-PSC device with 10 wt% addition of DTI also showed excellent thermal stability, showing 90% retention of its initial PCE after 48 h of thermal annealing. The results suggest that the DTI molecules (10 wt%) were well-dispersed in all-polymer domains under the thermal annealing conditions. Therefore, the DTI additive could be applied to various all-PSC systems to enhance their photovoltaic performance while maintaining the high stability of all-PSCs under the thermal stress.
Conclusions
We demonstrated that the use of DTI small-molecular additives is an effective and versatile approach to manipulate the morphology of the polymer blends and significantly improve the performance of all-PSCs. A small amount of DTI enhanced the crystallinity of polymer domains without causing phase-separation in the blends. Therefore, the exciton dissociation probability was greatly improved due to suppressed geminate recombination, while vertical charge transport properties were enhanced due to the formation of highly organized face-on polymer structures. Consequently, we successfully increased the PCEs of various all-PSC systems by a significant extent of 10–18%, i.e., PTB7-Th:P(NDI2HD-T) (PCE: 5.90 → 6.81%), PTB7-Th:P(NDI2HD-Se) (5.83 → 6.52%), PTB7-Th:P(NDI2HD-T2) (5.75 → 6.30%), and PPDT2FBT:P(NDI2HD-T) (3.77 → 4.43%). This work suggests that the use of highly crystalline small-molecular additives can be an effective strategy for overcoming the intrinsic problems of all-PSCs, such as inefficient exciton dissociation and charge transport ability compared to conventional fullerene-PSCs, and thereby advancing the practical potential of all-PSCs.
Experimental section
Materials
PTB7-Th was purchased from 1-Material Inc. PPDT2FBT (Mn = 40 kg mol−1, Đ = 1.9) was synthesized as reported in our previous research.15 P(NDI2HD-T) (number average molecular weight (Mn) = 58 kg mol−1, dispersity (Đ) = 2.1), P(NDI2HD-T2) (Mn = 47 kg mol−1, Đ = 2.7), and P(NDI2HD-Se) (Mn = 32 kg mol−1, Đ = 1.9) were synthesized via microwave-assisted Stille polycondensation as reported.34,63,64 The molecular weights were measured by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) as an eluent at 80 °C.
General methods
The UV-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra were measured using a UV-1800 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments). The samples for spectroscopic analyses were prepared on glass substrates under the same conditions for the device fabrication. The CV measurement (CHI 600C electrochemical analyzer) was performed at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 using a Pt working electrode, a Pt counter electrode, and a Ag reference electrode in an anhydrous acetonitrile solution containing 0.1 M Bu4NPF6, and calibrated against a ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple by assuming that the absolute energy level of Fc/Fc+ was −4.80 eV below the vacuum level. GIWAXS measurements were performed at Beamline 3C in the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (South Korea). The GIWAXS samples were prepared under the optimized conditions for the device fabrication on Si/ZnO substrates. X-rays with a wavelength of 1.1179 Å were used and the incidence angle (0.11–0.13°) was adjusted to allow complete penetration of the X-rays into the film. AFM was performed using a Veeco Dimension 3100 instrument in tapping mode. PL spectra were taken with a Horiba Jovin Yvon NanoLog spectrophotometer. For PL measurement, the neat films of PTB7-Th, DTI, and P(NDI2HD-T) were excited at 500 nm and emission spectra were measured in the range from 550 to 950 nm to avoid interference by an integer multiple of the excitation wavelength. Femtosecond TAS was conducted using a Ti:Sapphire laser (100 fs pulse width, 1 kHz repetition rate) to generate a 3.06 eV (405 nm) monochromatic excitation pulse and a broadband probe pulse from 0.8 to 1.55 eV. The initial photoexcitation density was maintained at ∼1016 cm−3 for all thin films. The broadband probe pulse was transmitted through the thin films and then detected by a CCD spectrometer. TR-PL was measured using time-correlated single photon counting with a tunable Ti:Sapphire laser (140 fs pulse width, 4 MHz repetition rate).
Synthesis of DTI
6,6′-Dibromo-N,N′-(2-ethylhexyl)-isoindigo (1.38 g, 2.06 mmol) and 2-(tributylstannyl)thiophene (1.69 g, 4.53 mmol) were prepared in a 250 mL round-bottom flask, and dissolved in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF) (20 mL). The solution was degassed for 10 min, and then tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium(0) (0.07 g, 0.06 mmol) was added into the solution. The mixture was refluxed for 10 h. Then, the solvent was evaporated and the remaining product was partitioned with dichloromethane (DCM)/water. The organic phase was washed with water three times and then dried using MgSO4. The solvent was removed and the crude product was purified by column chromatography using ethyl acetate and hexane as the eluent (ethyl acetate:hexane = 5:95) to yield a dark brown solid. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 300 MHz, δ): 9.16 (d, 2H), 7.40–7.42 (m, 2H), 7.35–7.37 (m, 2H), 7.31 (d, 1H), 7.28 (d, 1H), 7.11–7.14 (m, 2H), 6.97 (d, 2H), 3.77–3.61 (m, 4H), 1.90–1.82 (m, 2H), 1.48–1.25 (m, 16H), 0.98–0.88 (m, 12H) ppm. MS: m/z = 651.28 ([M], calc.: 650.95).
Device fabrication and characterization
The inverted-type devices were fabricated using the architecture of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag. ITO-coated glass substrates were washed with acetone, deionized (DI) water, and then isopropyl alcohol by ultrasonication. The substrates were dried over 1 h at 85 °C. The ZnO was synthesized according to previously reported literature.30 The ITO substrates were treated with O2 plasma before the deposition of the ZnO layer with a thickness of ∼30 nm by spin-coating. The substrates were annealed at 215 °C for 10 min under ambient conditions, and then transferred into a glovebox. For the active layer blends, the D:A ratio was kept at 1.3:1 (w/w). The total concentration (D + A) was 11.5 mg mL−1 in chloroform containing 0.8 vol% of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as the solvent additive. The DTI was added into the solutions in various ratios from 10 to 50 wt%. The blend solutions were stirred for more than 1 h at 45 °C and spin-cast onto the ITO/ZnO substrates. The thickness of each resulting film was 80–90 nm as measured using a surface profiler (Veeco Dektak-8). The blend films were aged over 1 day in a N2-filled glovebox. Then, the blend films were placed in a thermal evaporation chamber under high vacuum (less than 5 × 10−6 Torr) for 30 min before evaporating approximately 10 nm of MoO3 and 120 nm of Ag. The area of the active layer of the device was 0.09 cm2, which was measured using an optical microscope. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were measured under simulated AM 1.5G solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2, Peccell:PEC-L01) under ambient conditions. This solar simulator system satisfies the Class AAB, ASTM Standards. The intensity of the solar simulator was calibrated carefully by using a standard silicon reference cell with a KG-5 visible color filter. The J–V measurement was performed using a Keithley 2400 SMU.
Space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurement
The hole mobilities and electron mobilities of all-polymer blends with different DTI weight ratios were measured by the SCLC method using device structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/blends/Au (hole only) and ITO/ZnO/blends/LiF/Al (electron-only), respectively. The blend films were prepared with the same solutions as for the device fabrication. A range of 0–8 V was applied to measure the current–voltage curves and the results were fitted to the Mott–Gurney equation:  where ε0 is the permittivity of free space (8.85 × 10−14 F cm−1), ε is the relative dielectric constant of the active layer, μ is the charge-carrier mobility, V is the potential across the device (V = Vapplied − Vbi − Vr, where Vbi is the built-in potential and Vr is the voltage drop caused by the resistance), and L is the active layer thickness.
