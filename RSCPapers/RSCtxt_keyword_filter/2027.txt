    , Accepted 12th January 2018First published on 15th January 2018AbstractIn this study, a bis-chelating bridging perylene diimide ditopic ligand, namely N,N′-di(1,10-phenanthroline)-1,6,7,12-tetrakis-(4-methoxyphenoxy)perylene tetracarboxylic acid diimide (1), was synthesized and characterized. Further reactions of 1 with d8 metal ions such as Pt(II) and Pd(II) having preferential square-planar geometry afforded the novel triads [(Cl2)M(II)-(1)-M(II)(Cl2)] where M(II) = Pt(II) (2), and Pd(II) (3), respectively. The isolated triads and the key precursor were fully characterized by FT-IR, 1D-NMR (1H NMR and 13C DEPT NMR), 2D-NMR (1H–1H COSY, 1H–13C HSQC, 1H–13C HMBC), MALDI-TOF mass and UV/Vis spectroscopy. The electrochemical properties of 1, 2 and 3 were investigated by cyclic voltammetry as well as in situ spectroelectrochemistry and also in situ electrocolorimetric measurements. These compounds were shown to exhibit net colour changes suitable for electrochromic applications. The compounds exhibited remarkably narrow HOMO–LUMO gaps, leading to their ease of reduction at low negative potentials. More importantly, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were also fabricated using 1–3 to clarify the potential use of these complexes as a sensitizer. Analysis of the experimental data indicated that 2 has good potential as a sensitizer material for DSSCs.
1. Introduction
In order to develop a new organic solar cell with high power conversion efficiency and high stability, it is required to exhibit light harvesting, charge transfer and charge transport properties as well as photo-, thermal and chemical stability. In a DSSC, the photosensitizer plays one of the most relevant roles for achieving better light harvesting. The role of the photosensitizer is to absorb photons and transfer an electron to the semiconductor, and finally form a connection between the two electrodes. Although ruthenium complexes are the most preferred photosensitizer in DSSCs,1 the disadvantages of Ru complexes are the high production cost and long-time unavailability of these noble metal materials.2 Recently, several types of dye molecules including polyene and coumarin,3 hemicyanine,4 phthalocyanine5 and polyaniline6 have been studied as an alternative to Ru complex sensitizers. Among all the potential photosensitizer materials, perylene diimides (PDIs) are the most promising candidates for organic-based optoelectronic devices because of their excellent optical and electronic properties.7,8 These chromophores have been applied in many electronic and photonic devices i.e. PVs and DSSCs8–16 owing to their high photochemical and thermal stability, high absorption coefficient for visible light, high fluorescence quantum yield, propensity to self-assemble, and strong electron-accepting character.17–19
The relationship between the photovoltaic performance and the structure of PDI-based copolymers and oligomers has recently been discussed.20 In particular, metal ion-driven well-defined PDI-based metallosupramolecular systems were thoroughly reviewed.21 In these systems, PDI derivatives were functionalized at the imide positions with coordinating receptors such as pyridine or imidazole (monodentate),22,23 2,2′-bipyridine (bidentate)24 and 2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine (tridentate).22 Unfortunately, coordination polymers obtained via coordination-driven self-assembly of ditopic receptors such as bis(4-py)-PDI or bis(4′-terpy)-PDI have low solubility and poor processability.25,26 Therefore, an alternative synthetic strategy has been recently established by our group in order to obtain a more soluble and well-defined stoichiometry and strict geometrical complementary of the building blocks.22 Thus, we have very recently reported the synthesis of a ditopic bridging PDI ligand incorporating imidazole rings at the imide positions together with its soluble cationic metal complexes with the redox active square-planar platinum(II)- and palladium(II)-terpyridyl ions.22 This study has shown that the attachment of the square-planar Pt(II) and Pd(II)-terpy units to the PDI core strongly influenced the performance of photovoltaic devices. However, these novel triads were not sufficiently stable, as revealed by the mass studies, which showed that at least one of the coordinated terpyridyl-metal(II) units was defragmented from the PDI core.22 On the other hand, Carlos et al.27 have reported that structurally rigid 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) as a strong field coordination ligand increases the stability of the complex that hampers its photo-dissociation. They have also reported that the dyad [Ru(II)(phen)2(phen-PDI-phen) photosensitizes the formation of singlet-oxygen by triplet–triplet energy transfer. These studies have inspired us to synthesize a symmetric phen-PDI-phen bridging ligand (1) which has four bulky 4-methoxyphenoxy groups at the bay positions. These groups disrupt the PDI aggregation that has a pronounced influence on the optical spectra, and increase the solubility and decrease the photoluminescence quenching in the solid state as observed for [Ir(ppy)2-phen-PDI (dyad)]+ (ref. 28) and other related cases.22,29–31 As reported by Sastre-Santos et al.28 this dyad exhibited highly efficient electroluminescence (EL) in the deep-red region for the light-emitting electrochemical cell (LEC) application. In the present study, the symmetrical structures of 1, 2 and 3 which make all the chromophores energetically equal seem to be important for the energy transfer capabilities of these materials.32 Moreover, the chelating phen ligand owing to its low lying π* antibonding orbitals can readily form complexes with the reducing metal cations hence generating a low energy metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) electronic state.33,34 Previous studies on the well-known ruthenium complex have shown that charge separation within the sensitizers is an important characteristic for efficient charge transfer within the system. Spatial separation of the positive charge left on the dye and the injected electrons after the MLCT result in a decrease of the rate of recombination between the injected electrons and the oxidized dye molecules.35,36 Hence, the objective of the present work is to synthesize thermally and chemically stable neutral dinuclear metal complexes with an increased molar extinction coefficient.24 Although both d8 metal ions adopt the same geometry, they have different binding strengths and reversibility and also different optoelectronic properties, important in the PV applications.37 Carlos et al.38 reported that unlike the Pd(II)-dyad, the Pt(II)-dyad showed a strong spin–orbit coupling that resulted in a populated long-lived triplet state of PDI.27
Here, we report the electrochemical and in situ spectroelectrochemical properties of 1 and its corresponding dinuclear metal complexes [(Cl2)Pt(II)-(1)-Pt(II)(Cl2)] (2) and [(Cl2)Pd(II)-(1)-Pd(II)(Cl2)] (3), respectively. Electrochemical redox and electronic absorption properties, and the associated colour changes of the compounds have been identified by combined voltammetric, in situ spectroelectrochemical and in situ electrocolorimetric measurements in nonaqueous solution medium. The voltammetric measurements revealed that new chromophores usually undergo one-electron reversible redox processes without the association of chemical reactions. In situ spectroelectrochemical and in situ electrocolorimetric measurements showed the ability of the compounds to give net colour changes and thus, their suitability for electrochromic applications. The compounds were found to have significant narrow HOMO–LUMO gaps, leading to their ease of reduction at low negative potentials. Dye-sensitized solar cells were also fabricated using 1–3 as a sensitizer in order to clarify the potential use of these complexes as sensitizers. Analysis of the experimental data indicated that 2 derivative has good potential as a sensitizer material for DSSCs.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Syntheses and characterization
The synthesis of triads 2 and 3 from 1 are depicted in Scheme 1, the syntheses of 139 and 2 and 340 were adapted from the previously reported methods for the structurally related compounds. The IR (ATR) spectrum of 1 unambiguously proves the completion of the imidization by the absence of the intense anhydride peaks. For a better comparison, the spectra of 1, 2 and 3 are shown in Fig. S1, S2 and S3,† respectively. These spectra are almost identical, indicating that metal ion coordination has no significant effect on the spectrum of 1. The mass spectra of the triads unambiguously confirm the structures of 1, 2 and 3. The molecular ion peaks at m/z 1236.3 as [M + H]+ for 1 (Fig. S4†), 1731.080 as [M − Cl]+ for 2 (Fig. S5†), 1635.03 as a Na adduct [M + 2Na]+ and 1169.2 as a molecular ion peak [M + H]+ for 3 (Fig. S6†) were observed, respectively.

The 1H NMR and 13C NMR data (chemical shifts and coupling constants) and the correct integration ratios for 1, 2 and 3 are consistent with the proposed structures as indicated in Tables 1 and 2. The numbering scheme of the atoms is indicated in Fig. 1. Unambiguous assignments for all protons and carbons were carried out by the combined information of 1D-NMR and 2D-NMR experiments. Thus, on the basis of the 13C DEPT, 1H–1H COSY, 1H–13C HSQC and 1H–13C HMBC spectra, the chemical shifts of the 1H and 13C nuclei of aromatic systems of PDI and phen moieties (1, 2 and 3) were clearly assigned. In order to compare and readily observe the effect of the metal ion coordination, the 1H NMR spectra of the compounds are shown in Fig. S7† for 1, Fig. S8† for 2, and Fig. S9† for 3. The H4 and H7 protons were differentiated upon the formation of Pt(II) and Pd(II) complexes. This may due to the restriction of the free rotation of the phen ring after coordination as a result of stacking interactions or intramolecular short contacts within the molecules. The cross peaks of the 1H–1H COSY spectra show the correlation between the phen protons H2, H3, H4, H6, H7, H8, H9. The observed cross peaks indicate the following correlations: 1, 2 and 3 H2 ↔ H3, H9 ↔ H8, H4 ↔ H3, H7 ↔ H8. The 1H–1H COSY spectra evidently indicate that the H7 proton shows more deshielding than the H4 proton. The 1H–1H COSY spectrum of 3 is shown as an example in Fig. 2 and Fig. S10† for 1 and Fig. S11† for 2.

The 13C DEPT NMR spectra of 1, 2 and 3 unambiguously support the molecular integrity and the purity of the compounds. The 13C DEPT NMR spectrum of 2 is shown as an example in Fig. 3 and Fig. S12† for 1 and Fig. S13† for 3. The 1H–13C HSQC spectra of 1, 2 and 3 show the correlation between the proton and the carbon nuclei and as an example the 1H–13C HSQC spectrum of 1 is shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. S14† for 2 and Fig. S15† for 3. 1H–13C HSQC spectra showed that the C8 and C3 had the same carbon chemical shift after the formation of PtII and PdII complexes. The C–H coupling results are given in Table 2. The 1H–13C HMBC spectra of 1, 2 and 3 are given in the ESI† (Fig. S16† for 1, Fig. S17† for 2, Fig. S18† for 3). The chemical shifts of Ca, Cb, Cc for PDIs were verified from the 1H–13C HMBC spectra of the compounds. Ca was identified by the interaction with HP1 and H1 protons. Cb was identified by the interaction with H2 and H3 protons. Cc was identified by the interaction with HP1 and H4 in addition to the H2 and H3 protons, as well. All these comprehensive NMR investigations have precisely proven the molecular structures and purity of the compounds.

In order to illustrate the influence of the phen units on the photo-physical properties of the perylene diimides, the UV/Vis spectrum of N,N′-di(2-ethylhexyl)-1,6,7,12-tetrakis-(4-methoxyphenoxy)perylene-3,4,9,10 tetracarboxylic acid diimide (PDI-al) in DMSO is shown in Fig. 5. All compounds exhibit the characteristic absorptions between 400 and 650 nm. The absorption spectra are all expressed as a summation of the spectra of the constituents: the [PtII/PdII(phen)Cl2] or phen itself and the perylene core. It is noteworthy that the observed intense absorption bands at 260–300 nm in 1, 2 and 3 but a very low intense absorption band at 290 nm in the alkyl derivative (PDI-al) evidently show the contribution of the phen units (Fig. 5). Significantly, all compounds (1, 2 and 3) show bathochromic shifts in the lower energy bands at around 550 and 590 nm (Fig. 5) in comparison with that of the alkyl derivative (PDI-al) as an indication of the participation of the phen chromophore in the UV/Vis absorption. However, it should be emphasized that the platinum(II)-chromophore (2) shows very small hyperchromism and more significantly slight bathochromic shifts (∼4 nm) compared to that of free ligand 1 as shown in Fig. 5, suggesting the presence of very weak electronic interactions between these constituents in these triads.41 The aggregation behaviors of the PDIs were also investigated at different concentrations in DMSO (Fig. S19† for 1, Fig. S20† for 2, Fig. S21† for 3). As the concentration increases, the intensity of absorption also increases, indicating that all compounds obey the Beer–Lambert law in concentrations ranging from 1.2 × 10−5 to 2 × 10−6 M. The UV/Vis absorption maximum values and extinction coefficients are summarized in Table 3. The spectra of 1 and its metal complexes 2 and 3 show a similar profile as having three absorption maxima in the UV/Vis region. The absorption maxima in 2 and 3 were approximately 3 nm red-shifted compared to those of 1. The fluorescence emission spectra of 1, 2 and 3 in DMSO (Fig. S22†) exhibited emission at 696, 675 and 671 nm, respectively showing that upon coordination the emission bands for both 2 and 3 significantly blue-shifted without considerable alteration in the intensity of the bands, whereas in DCM, all compounds have almost the same emission maxima at around 630 nm, but 2 and 3 suffer a notable reduction compared to 1 as shown in Fig. S23,† probably because the perylene moiety is quenched by a photoinduced intramolecular electron transfer (PET) process in the imine.42 For a better comparison, the emission spectrum of PDI-al in DMSO is also included (Fig. S22†) to prove that the emission occurred mainly due to the perylene core. The emission data for 1, 2 and 3 including the Stoke's shifts are given in Table 3.

The relative fluorescence quantum yields of these compounds (ΦF < 0.04) were measured by a comparative method43 (ESI†). They are very weakly luminescent in DMSO as summarized in Table 3. It is known that the introduction of methoxy groups in the bay positions leads to fluorescence quenching in certain dyes.22,44 The observed emission behaviour of 1, 2 and 3 in DMSO can be ascribed to their dipolar nature as reported in ref. 45 which states that donor (D)–acceptor (A) type fluorophores having dipolar nature are poorly emissive in highly polar solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide or methanol due to the twisted intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) excited state. Similar fluorescence quenching was reported for the related cases37,44,46 and was attributed to the distortion of the planarity of the perylene core.47
2.2. Electrochemistry and in situ spectroelectrochemistry
Electrochemical techniques, cyclic voltammetry (CV), square-wave voltammetry (SWV) and controlled potential coulometry (CPC), were used to collect the data for the redox processes of 1–3 and thus, identify their reduction and oxidation characters. The data including the half-peak potentials for the redox processes (E1/2), anodic to cathodic peak potential separations (ΔEp), peak current ratios (Ipa/Ipc for reduction and Ipc/Ipa for oxidation) and the potential difference between the first half-peak oxidation and reduction processes (V) are listed in Table 4.

Cyclic and square-wave voltammograms of 1–3 in DCM are shown in Fig. 6–8. ΔEp values are within the range of 50–120 mV for all redox processes of the compounds (Table 4). These data suggest that the redox processes involve electrochemically reversible or quasi-reversible transfer of one electron per molecule. The transfer of the unit number of electrons and electrochemical reversibility, i.e., fast electron transferability of the compounds were also supported by CPC.

 Fig. 8  Cyclic (A) and square wave (B) (pulse width: 100 mV, step width: 5 mV and frequency: 25 Hz) voltammograms of 5.0 × 10−4 M 3 in TBAP/DCM. 
The compounds, both ligand 1 and its metal complexes 2 and 3 similarly displayed two reductions and an oxidation process in DCM/TBAP. Therefore, it appears that platinum and palladium metal sides are redox-inactive and all redox processes are PDI ligand-based. On the other hand, the fast electron transfer nature of the redox processes should be due to high π-electron conjugation in the PDI core. On the other hand, the unit peak current ratios of the redox couples of both the ligand and its metal complexes reveal that these compounds produce stable redox species without coupling of any chemical reaction such as decomposition and/or aggregation. This is in contrast to the results of our recently published study,22 in which the chemical stability of the electrochemically produced redox species N,N′-bis(3-propylimidazole)-1,6,7,12-tetrakis-(4-methoxyphenoxy)perylene diimide was found to be higher than that of its 2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridyl-Pt(II) or -Pd(II)-complexes. The half-peak potentials of the redox processes of ligand 1 are generally more negative than those of metal complexes 2 and 3, due to ligand to metal charge transfer upon complex formation. However, potential shifts are not pronounced due to the interruption of the π-electron conjugation and thus, electronically decoupling of the ligand and metal side fragments. A remarkable difference between the redox behaviours of palladium and platinum complexes is not observed, since these metals are in the same group with similar chemical and electronic properties. However, low shifts in peak potentials should be due to the difference in their polarizing powers. The voltammetric waves of 1 were remarkably sharp both in DCM and DMSO (Fig. 6 and Fig. S24†) while those of 2 and 3 were relatively broad (Fig. 7 and 8). It appears that the molecules of 2 and 3 form aggregated species resulting from the intermolecular interactions between the PDI and metal complex sides of two neighbouring molecules.
The half-peak potentials of the compounds in DMSO and DCM are similar to each other, except for the small shift of the first reduction potential to more negative values (Table 4). This should be due to the absence of any coordinating side that can bind polar DMSO molecules and cause a difference in redox behaviour with respect to that in DCM. It was not possible to record the first oxidation process of the compounds in DMSO/TBAP medium, due to the narrower positive potential range compared to that in DCM/TBAP. However, the oxidation peak of the compounds could be detected by SVW in DCM as a result of the relatively broader positive potential range available in this solvent medium. The one-electron first reduction potential of the compounds is related to their LUMO energy level while the potential for the one-electron first oxidation corresponds to the HOMO energy level. Therefore, the detection of both the first oxidation and the first reduction peaks has a special importance for the identification of the band gap electrochemically. The HOMO–LUMO band gaps of 1–3 calculated from the difference of these potentials are shown in Table 4. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the compounds versus vacuum were also calculated taking the potential of the Fc/Fc+ reference couple as 0.50 V since the addition of 4.80 eV to the redox potentials relative to the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) reference system gives the values referring to the vacuum.48 The HOMO–LUMO band gaps of the compounds were also calculated from the spectral data reflecting the relevant electronic transitions (Table 4). The band gaps calculated from the UV/Vis spectral data and electrochemical redox data are highly compatible and point out the reliability of the calculated values. These values within the range of 1.84–1.95 eV are lower than the band gaps of various N,N′-disubstituted-PDI compounds22,49–54 and suitable for their usability in photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications as organic semiconducting materials.
The spectral changes and the associated colour transitions occurred during the electrolysis of the compounds in DMSO and DCM at suitable peak potentials have also been recorded by in situ spectroelectrochemistry and in situ electrocolorimetry. These measurements were made with the aim of evaluating the technological applicability of the compounds in electrochromic devices as electrochromic materials. Fig. 9 shows the in situ spectral and colorimetric changes recorded during the redox processes of 1 in DCM. Ligand 1 originally has three main electronic transitions at 267 nm, 461 nm and 599 nm, and blue colour. The comparison of the energies corresponding to the electronic transitions of compound 1 with its electrochemically identified 1.92 eV HOMO–LUMO band gap suggests that the band with 599 nm maximum wavelength corresponds to the electronic transitions from the HOMO to the LUMO. During the first reduction process, the absorption intensities of the bands at 461 nm and 599 nm decrease while a new peak appears at 800 nm. These spectral changes are associated with a colour change from blue to pink (Fig. 9A and D). During the second reduction process (R2) at −0.80 V vs. SCE, a decrease of the absorption at 800 nm and the formation of a new peak at 677 nm are observed while the peaks at 461 and 599 nm disappear (Fig. 9B). In the meantime, net colour change from pink to green is observed during these spectral changes (Fig. 9D). As shown in Fig. 9C and D, net spectral changes and thus, the net colour transition are not observed during the first oxidation process. However, change in the tone of the original blue colour of the solution occurs and turquoise colour is obtained.
 Fig. 9  
In situ UV/Vis spectral (A–C) and colour (D) changes monitored during the redox processes of 1 in TBAP/DCM. 
The spectral changes monitored during the first and second reduction processes of 1 in DMSO are similar to those observed in DCM (Fig. S25†). However, there are some differences leading to different colour changes. New bands within the range of 650–850 nm form simultaneously during the first reduction while the intensity of the two absorption peaks between 400 and 650 nm decreases. Upon the second reduction process, the absorption of the bands within the range of 400–650 nm continues to decrease whereas a sharp absorption peak appeared around 700 nm. These spectral changes lead to colour changes from blue to turquoise first and then to green (Fig. S25D†). The spectral and colour changes observed during the reduction process of 2 in DCM are shown in Fig. 10. Although the spectral changes in DCM and DMSO resemble those monitored for 1, colour transitions are somewhat different, especially in DMSO, due to the relative intensities of the observed absorption bands around 600, 700 and 800 nm. In DMSO, the original blue colour changes first to blue during the first reduction process and then, to orange at the end of the second reduction process. Spectral changes and the reflected colour changes monitored during the redox processes of 3 were also remarkably similar, with small differences from those observed for 2 (Table 4).

2.3. Photovoltaic studies
Key parameters for a DSSC are open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and photovoltaic conversion efficiency (η) and should be determined under particular illumination conditions, the so-called standard test conditions.55 Here, as usual, the fill factor is defined as; (1)where Jmax and Vmax are the current and voltage at a certain point on the J–V characteristics in which the cell delivers the maximum power density. The solar energy-to-electricity conversion efficiency η is defined as, (2)where Pin is the power of the incident light (100 mW cm−2 in our case).
The photovoltaic performance of the N,N′-di(1,10-phenanthroline)-1,6,7,12-tetrakis-(4-methoxyphenoxy) perylene tetracarboxylic acid diimide (1) and further reactions of 1 with d8 metal ions such as Pt(II) and Pd(II) having preferential square-planar geometry (2 and 3, respectively) as a sensitizer were investigated by the fabrication of DSSCs. The room temperature J–V characteristics of 1–3 based photovoltaic devices under AM 1.5G illumination at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 11. The rectifying behavior for all devices, as expected from DSSC device physics, can be seen at first sight.
 Fig. 11  Room temperature J–V characteristics for 1–3 sensitized TiO2 solar cells under AM 1.5 illumination. 
It is also clear from Fig. 11 that the rectification ratio, which is defined as the ratio of the forward current to the reverse current at a certain applied voltage, varies from 1.4 to 5.
A comparison of the photovoltaic parameters, such as short circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), maximum output power (Pmax) and power conversion efficiency (η), of the devices are tabulated in Table 5. As shown in Fig. 11, the 1–3 based cells exhibit dramatically different device performances when the sensitizer was changed from 1 to 2 or 3. It appears that the insertion of platinum and palladium metals to the PDI ligand has a strong effect on the photovoltaic behavior of the compounds. As is clear from Fig. 11 and Table 5, the device with 2 exhibits better photovoltaic performance with an open circuit voltage of 0.84 V, a short-circuit photocurrent density of 9.46 mA cm−2, a fill factor of 0.56, and a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 4.48% under AM 1.5G illumination. It was found that the trend observed for the photoelectric conversion efficiency is in the order 2 > 3 > 1. As is well known from the operating principle of DSSCs, many elementary physical processes, such as the charge transport mechanism from the excited sensitizer to the working electrode and from the electrolyte to the sensitizer, must be considered to explain the observed photovoltaic behaviour. It is well documented in the literature that the observed open circuit voltage in a DSSC is determined by the difference between the quasi-Fermi level of the electrons in the photoanode and the redox potential of the electrolyte.56 Hence, the chemical potential of the redox species might be the same for all devices when the same electrolyte is used. In this case, the open circuit voltage is controlled by the potential of the conduction band edge and the number of electrons in TiO2.57

Under steady-state illumination conditions, the number of electrons in TiO2 is controlled by the balance between the injected electrons from the excited dye molecules and the recombination of charges. Therefore, it can be concluded that the number of electrons in TiO2 can be enhanced by improving the electron injection efficiency which results in an increase in open circuit voltage. On the other hand, recombination processes cause a decrease in the population of the charge carriers and open circuit voltage. It should be noted here that the potential of the conduction band edge and the number of electrons in TiO2 are related to the surface charge and charge recombination, respectively. The observed high Voc in the 2 sensitized DSSC compared to 1 and 3 can be attributed to higher electron density due to a better injection of electrons into the conduction band of TiO2 from the excited dye of 2. The other performance parameter for a solar cell is the short circuit current density. It should be noted here that three basic processes should take place for the current generation. These are (i) adsorption of the incident light by the dye molecule and the injection of photo-generated electrons from the LUMO level of the dye molecule to the conduction band of the TiO2, leaving the dye in the oxidized state, (ii) collection of the charges by the appropriate electrodes and (iii) the dye regeneration process, restoration of the dye molecule by transfer of electrons from the electrolyte. Therefore, the short circuit current for a photovoltaic device should be considered as a combination of these processes. A close investigation of Table 5 shows that the observed short-circuit current density, which is another performance parameter for DSSCs, is also high for the 2 sensitized device. As mentioned above, the injection and the collection efficiencies are the most important determining factors for the photo-conversion efficiency in a DSSC. Exciton dissociation is strongly dependent on the HOMO–LUMO level of the dye molecule and the redox potential of the electrolyte. It is well documented in the literature that the photosensitizer must have a more negative LUMO level than the conduction band of the TiO2 and a more positive HOMO level than the redox potential of the electrolyte.58
In this respect, the observed high short-circuit current density in the 2 based DSSC device can be attributed to the low recombination rate of injected electrons. An overall evaluation of the photovoltaic studies revealed that the performance of the complexes as a sensitizer is strongly dependent on the presence of the metal ion and can be modified easily by inserting different metal ions.
3. Experimental
3.1. Materials
All chemicals were purchased from commercial sources, and used without further purification. Organic solvents were purified, dried and distilled under dry argon. 1,6,7,12-Tetrachloroperylene-3,4-9,10-tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride and 1,10-phenanthroline were purchased from Aldrich. The starting materials 5-amino-1,10-phenanthroline,59,60 Pt(DMSO)2Cl261 and Pd(DMSO)2Cl261 were synthesized by the previously reported methods. The synthesis and characterization of N,N′-di(2-ethylhexyl)-1,6,7,12-tetrachloroperylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic acid diimide, N,N′-di(2-ethylhexyl)-1,6,7,12-tetrakis-(4-methoxyphenoxy)perylene-3,4,9,10 tetracarboxylic acid diimide and 1,6,7,12-tetrakis-(4-methoxyphenoxy)perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride were carried out as reported.22 The purity of the products was tested in each step by TLC (SiO2). Column chromatography was performed on silica gel 60.
3.2. Equipment
Melting points were recorded on a Bushi Melting Points B-540 apparatus. FT-IR (ATR) spectra were recorded with a PerkinElmer FT-IR Spectra 100 Spectrophotometer at room temperature. Mass spectra were acquired on a Rapiflex MALDI-TOF-MS (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen-Germany) equipped with a Smartbeam 3D 10 kHz 355 nm Nd:YAG laser applying 1000 shots per each sample spot using a single shot laser configuration. All MALDI-TOF-MS data were acquired in positive ion and reflectron mode. Calibration was performed with a series of peptides existing in a mixture (Bruker Daltonics standard) prior to the mass spectrometric analysis of the samples. For the samples, a MALDI matrix from 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid was prepared in H2O–ACN–THF(10:45:45, v/v/v) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a concentration of 5 mg mL−1. The MALDI sample was prepared by mixing sample solutions (5 mg mL−1 in ACN–THF–DCM (48:48:4, v/v/v)) with the matrix solution (1:10, v/v) in a 0.5 mL eppendorf® micro tube. Finally 0.2 μL of this mixture was deposited on the sample plate, dried at room temperature and then analyzed. 1H NMR, 13C NMR DEPT, 1H–1H COSY, 1H–13C HSQC and 1H–13C HMBC spectra were obtained in DMSO-d6 with an Agilent 600 MHz Premium Compact NMR spectrometer at room temperature. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm (parts per million) with reference to TMS. Coupling constants J are given in Hertz (Hz). UV/Vis spectral measurements were carried out with a CARY 100 Bio UV-Visible spectrophotometer and fluorescence spectra were obtained on a PerkinElmer LS55 Fluorescence spectrometer using 1 cm path length cuvettes at room temperature. All solutions for all absorption and emission measurements were prepared freshly.
3.3. Electrochemistry and in situ spectroelectrochemistry
A Gamry Reference 600 potentiostat/galvanostat and an electrochemical cell with three-electrode configuration were used for voltammetric measurements. The working, the counter and the reference electrodes were a Pt disc, a Pt wire and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE), separated from the bulk of the solution by a double bridge, respectively. An Ocean Optics HR2000+ diode array spectrophotometer and a thin-layer quartz spectroelectrochemical cell, also with three-electrode configuration were employed for in situ UV/Vis spectroelectrochemical and in situ electrocolorimetric measurements under potentiostatic control. Electrocolorimetric measurements were performed by recording colour coordinates (x, y, and z values) during the redox processes of the compounds at suitable potentials, with the standard illuminant A with 2° observer at constant temperature. External light was excluded by a light booth design. During the measurements, readings were taken as a function of time under kinetic control, however, only the colour coordinates at the beginning and end of each redox process were reported. Electrochemical grade TBAP in extra pure DCM or DMSO was employed as the supporting electrolyte at a concentration of 0.10 mol dm−3.

3.3.1 Production and characterization of photovoltaic devices. 
Fluorine-doped stannic oxide (FTO) coated glasses having a sheet resistance ∼20 Ω cm−2 and a 20 nm-sized anatase TiO2 nanopowder was used as the substrate and working electrode, respectively. Before the deposition of the nanocrystalline TiO2 paste, the FTO substrates was treated with a detergent solution in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min, followed by cleaning in isopropyl alcohol for 10 min and then drying in a stream of nitrogen gas. TiO2 paste was prepared as previously reported.62 A 10 μm thick layer of TiO2 paste was deposited onto the FTO coated substrates by the doctor blade technique. The developed working electrodes were sintered at 460 °C for 30 min in ambient air and then sensitized in concentrated 1–3 solution for 24 h at room temperature. At the end of 24 h, 1–3 sensitized working electrodes were rinsed in DMSO to remove the physically adsorbed dye molecules. The 1–3 sensitized photoanodes were sealed against the thermally platinised counter electrode with hot melt plastic spacers. The electrolyte (0.1 M LiI, 0.03 M I2, 0.5 M tetrabutylammonium iodide and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile) was introduced into the gap between two electrodes with a syringe. The active area of DSSCs was about 0.3 cm2. The photovoltaic performance of the devices was analysed by current density–voltage (J–V) measurements using a Keithley 6517 electrometer under simulated AM 1.5G illumination.

4. Conclusions
The novel Pt(II) and Pd(II) complexes of the 1,10-phenanthroline functionalized ditopic PDI core were successfully accomplished to afford new dinuclear platinum(II) and palladium(II) triads. The newly synthesized compounds were fully characterized by comprehensive NMR studies and also other physical and spectroscopic methods. These compounds are weakly luminescent in DMSO. It is clear from the electrochemical redox potentials of the novel PDI compounds that these compounds are reduced easily and thus, can be used as electron acceptors in the construction of new optoelectronic devices. On the other hand, the compounds display pronounced semiconducting properties with remarkably low HOMO–LUMO band gaps. In addition, the association of the net spectral and multicolour changes with their reversible and facile redox processes suggests that the novel compounds are suitable for electrochromic applications. The investigation of the PDI ligand and its metal complexes 2 and 3 as a photosensitizer in DSSCs showed that the main performance parameters such as open circuit voltage, short circuit current, fill factor and photoconversion efficiency strongly depend on the insertion and the kind of inserted metal ion. In summary, our results indicated that PDI ligand with its Pt complex has great potential for use in DSSCs as a sensitizer.
