    , Accepted 17th May 2019First published on 17th May 2019AbstractEnergy collection and molecular separation are two emerging applications based on membrane technologies. It remains a challenge to improve the separation performance of molecular channels. Meanwhile, the application of membranes is typically impeded by their poor stability under practical hydrous conditions. Herein, we present the fabrication of a uniformly lamellar membrane using montmorillonite nanosheets as building blocks. We managed to achieve nanofluidic ion transport and molecular separation simultaneously. The membrane nanochannels possess nanofluidic ion transport properties with an output power density of up to 0.18 W m−1 at a membrane thickness of 11.2 μm under a 1000-fold transmembrane concentration difference. The membrane also shows a water permeance of 429 L m−2 h−1 atm−1 at a thickness of 2.5 μm and high separation efficiency for both cationic and anionic dyes. Moreover, the montmorillonite-based membranes can maintain high stability under aqueous conditions with soaking, shaking, and even ultrasonication.
Introduction
Energy utilization and technological developments have been the foundation for human progress throughout human history.1 Traditional non-renewable energy reserves are declining, and the continued reliance on fossil fuels has led to widespread environmental issues.2 Therefore, the transformation and utilization of new energy sources are extremely urgent. In addition to solar,3 thermal,4 and hydrogen energy5 which have been extensively studied, renewable energies contained in water systems are also of great interest, including mechanical energy of flowing water6 and potential chemical energy of water salinity.7 For energy conversion of salinity gradients, the traditional method is to mix seawater and river water through an ion exchange membrane with selective permeability, during which the salinity gradient energy is obtained by reverse electroosmosis technology.8 But it suffers from a low power density and a high power generation cost, limiting its widespread adoption.7 With the development of artificial energy conversion devices, the use of solid nanopores with regular geometry and charge selectivity instead of conventional ion exchange membranes to collect salinity gradient energy has gained high attention.9–12 Two-dimensional (2D) lamellar membranes with millions of confined nanochannels show great potential in energy conversion and power generation.13–16 The confined space in the nanochannels with a typical size in the order of 1–100 nm, which is comparable to the Debye length,17 can drastically change the behavior of the nanofluid in fully wetted 2D membrane materials.18–20
Membrane-based technologies not only have great potential in harvesting green energy, but also play an important role in water purification because of their water transport properties and molecular sieving capabilities.21–23 Molecular rejection for nanochannels of the membranes involves both charge-specific separation and physical size cut-off.24 Nanoscale wrinkles, exposed functional groups inside the channel, and molecules externally introduced into the channels are regularly considered as support pillars to construct nanochannels, but are also seen as a barrier to permeation.25 Many 2D nanoplatelets have been chosen to prepare lamellar membranes for harvesting energy and purifying water, including graphene, MoS2, and MXenes.23,26–28 However, it is highly desirable to explore more environmentally friendly and cost-effective alternatives, which possess a monolayer structure, high mechanical strength, and robust chemical stability without sacrificing high efficiency, for various applications.
Clays are the most abundant naturally occurring phyllosilicate minerals in the earth's crust.29 To some extent, unlike other minerals, clays are sustainable because weathering and hydrothermal alteration constantly generate clays at a rate much faster than the formation of other minerals.30 Clays have already shown significant potential as nanosheet building blocks for the reconstruction of lamellar membranes because of their ease of exfoliation, high chemical and thermal stability, and structural diversity.31–37 In general, the thickness of most individual single-layer clay nanosheets (in the ∼1–12 nm range14,33,38) is larger than that of GO sheets while their lateral dimensions (in the ∼300–1000 nm range14,39–42) are smaller. Fast transport of molecules depends on regular and straight nanochannels, which allows for continuous and steady molecular-flow.43 Meanwhile, small width distribution of the nanochannels is the key to high membrane rejection.44
In this work, we choose montmorillonite (MMT) as the model building blocks to assemble 2D nanofluidic channels with decent energy conversion and molecular separation. Compared with other clays, MMT is much easier to be exfoliated into individual nanosheets, be modified to obtain desired surface properties, and be assembled into functional membranes.45–48
Experimental
Reconstruction of MMT nanosheets
MMT is a hydrated sodium calcium aluminum magnesium silicate hydroxide, (Na, Ca)0.33(Al, Mg)2(Si4O10)(OH)2·nH2O. Na+ MMT is produced by the cation exchange of Ca2+ with Na+. In addition, the Al and Si in the structure are often substituted by Fe/Mg and Al, respectively.49 A sample of 400 mg of Na+ MMT powder (from Minerals Technologies Inc.) was dispersed in 100 mL deionized (DI) water and then ultrasonicated for 2 h to obtain a uniform MMT dispersion. A sample of 200 mg of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, from Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 40 mL DI water with the assistance of ultrasonication. Then the MMT dispersion and CTAB solution were mixed with 100 mL ethanol under stirring for 2 h at 70 °C in a water bath, during which the exfoliated MMT nanosheets were readily modified by CTAB. A precipitate formed after alternatively washing with DI water and ethanol. Eventually, the precipitate was dispersed in 100 mL of ethanol with the assistance of stirring for 24 h to obtain the CTAB modified MMT dispersion.
The dispersion of the CTAB modified MMT (ca. 2.0 mg mL−1) was filtered through a nylon filter (47 mm in diameter, 0.2 μm in pore size, from Whatman) to form a reconstructed MMT membrane (RMM). The RMM was subsequently dried in air at room temperature to remove residual water. The flexible thin film can be readily removed from the nylon substrate. The thickness of the RMM can be easily controlled by varying the volume of the dispersion. Control MMT membranes were also fabricated via the same approach using non-modified MMT nanosheets.
Characterization
The microstructure of the RMMs was characterized using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, FEI NOVA NanoSEM 450). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D5005) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging was performed on a JEOL 2010 TEM (Tokyo, Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Atomic force microscopy imaging was performed on an Asylum Research AFM (MFP-3D). The hydrophilicity of the membrane surface was tested using a contact angle goniometer (ramé-hart Model 100). UV-vis spectra of the dyes were acquired on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Lambda 900, PerkinElmer) from 400 to 800 nm. Zeta potential measurements were performed on a Malvern Zetasizer (NanoZS90) using a dispersion of 0.10 mg mL−1. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) characterization was conducted on a PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 spectrophotometer to identify the existence of CTAB in the RMMs.
Electrical characterization
A piece of RMM was clamped in between a custom-built two-compartment electrochemical cell (Fig. 4a inset and 4c inset). The electrolyte reservoirs are large enough that a significant membrane potential is not built up to oppose the cationic flow during the electrochemical measurement. The resulting ionic current was recorded with a source meter (Keithley 2400) through a pair of Ag/AgCl electrodes. The test area is 0.2 mm2 for ion transport and salinity gradient energy conversion.
Water permeability and dye rejection of the RMMs
UV-visible spectra were used to evaluate the rejection performance of the RMMs for various dyes. Methylene blue (MB), methyl orange (MO), and rhodamine B (RB) were chosen to permeate the RMMs on a home-made dead-end vacuum filtration device with an effective area of 4.0 cm2 under a pressure difference of 1.0 atm at room temperature. The volume of the feed solution (5.0 μM) was 10.0 mL.
The permeance J (L m−2 h−1 atm−1) and rejection R (%) were calculated by using eqn (a) and (b), respectively: (a) (b)where V (L) is the volume of permeated water, A (m2) is the effective membrane area, Δt (h) is the permeation time, P (1.0 atm) is the pressure difference, and Cp and Cf are the concentrations of permeate and feed solutions, respectively.
Results and discussion
Herein, we report the design and fabrication of a 2D highly stable clay-based membrane that can be used for both salinity gradient energy conversion and organic dye/water separation. The reconstruction process is illustrated in Fig. 1a and S1.† MMT is a typical 2:1 layered silicate clay mineral. The unit cell is composed of an alumina octahedral sheet sandwiched by two silica tetrahedral sheets. In our work, first, Na+ MMT was dispersed in DI water with the assistance of stirring, followed by 30 min of ultrasonication, to obtain exfoliated MMT nanosheets. The exfoliation of Na+ MMT can be readily achieved by ultrasonication because of the weak interlayer interaction, the negative net layer charge, and the existence of exchangeable Na+ ions between the layers.38,40,50 Afterward, the MMT nanosheets were modified by mixing with a cationic surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), in water at 65 °C for 2 h. Finally, a reconstructed MMT membrane (RMM) was formed after vacuum filtration of the modified MMT dispersion by using a nylon filter. Fig. 1b schematically illustrates the structure of the RMM. As an ionic compound, CTAB is completely ionized in water.51 The resulting CTA+ is a positively charged tetrahedron with a long hydrophobic tail, attached on both sides of the negatively charged MMT nanosheets, forming a pillar-like structure in between 2D nanochannels.52,53

The lateral dimensions of the exfoliated MMT nanosheets are from dozens of microns to hundreds of microns based on TEM characterization (Fig. 2a). The AFM characterization revealed the morphology of a representative CTAB modified MMT nanosheet (Fig. 2b) with a thickness of ca. 2.2 nm (Fig. 2c). Since the thickness of a single-layer MMT nanosheet is ca. 1.0 nm (ref. 54) and the thickness of an individual CTAB layer is ca. 0.4 nm (Fig. S2†), considering the electrostatic interactions between MMT and CTAB, it is expected that one or more layers of CTAB molecules are adsorbed on both sides of MMT nanosheets. The AFM image (Fig. S3a†) and the height profiles (Fig. S3b†) of the RMM show the morphology of a typical membrane surface. Pristine MMT nanosheets were negatively charged with a zeta potential of −33.1 mV at pH 7. Upon modification with CTAB, a positive shift to −27.3 mV of the zeta potential was observed (Fig. 2d), because partial negative charges of MMT nanosheets were balanced by the positive charges of quaternary ammonium ions. This result suggests that most negative charges still remained. Moreover, the hydroxyl groups on the edge of MMT nanosheets are hydrophilic,55,56 namely, water is encouraged to enter the nanochannels through the entrance.57

The exfoliated 2D MMT nanosheets can be restacked into a membrane through a facile vacuum filtration process. The paper-like, free-standing RMM (Fig. 2e) can be readily removed from the nylon support. The free-standing RMM also possesses high flexibility; it remains intact when rolled on a glass rod with a diameter of 35 mm (Fig. 2f). Tensile tests were performed on both the RMMs and neat MMT membranes (Fig. S4†). Compared with the neat MMT membranes, it is clear that the chemical modification can enhance the mechanical properties of RMMs, because the electrostatic adsorption between MMT nanosheets and CTAB and the degree of entanglement between carbon chains are positively correlated with the content of CTAB.14,58 The RMM exhibits a well-ordered lamellar structure according to the SEM characterization (Fig. 2g). The chemical composition of MMT can be confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy mapping of the cross section of an RMM (Fig. S5†). The results show that the content of oxygen is the highest, and the content of silicon is roughly twice that of aluminum, which is consistent with the ratio of the two elements in the MMT crystal structure. We then used XRD to characterize the layered structure of the pristine MMT powder, MMT membrane, and RMM (Fig. 2h). The pristine MMT powder shows a diffraction peak at 9.1°, corresponding to an interlayer distance of 0.97 nm, attributed to the original bulk stacking and the trapped water molecules between the stacked MMT nanosheets.40,59 The restacked MMT membrane shows a peak at 7.3°, corresponding to an interlayer spacing of 1.22 nm, which suggests that the nanochannels are fully hydrated. After modification with CTAB, the RMM shows a strong diffraction peak at 5.2°, corresponding to an interlayer distance of 1.71 nm. The larger interlayer distance implies that CTAB molecules were successfully embedded between the reconstructed MMT neighboring nanosheets as spacers. By comparing the FTIR spectra of the MMT and RMM, shown in Fig. S6,† two new vibration bands at 2926 and 2847 cm−1 were observed, which can be assigned to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of –(CH2)n–, further supporting the presence of CTAB in the membrane structure.
The RMMs show extraordinary stability in water. Before modification with CTAB, the MMT membrane was hydrophilic with a surface contact angle of 66.5° (Fig. S7a†), consistent with the hydrophilic nature of bulk MMT. The MMT membranes are very difficult to remove from the nylon support. When the membranes with the nylon substrate were soaked in water, they were easily swollen and then disintegrated in water quickly with a slight shake, which is expected (Fig. 3a and b). After 30 s of ultrasonication, the restacked MMT membranes were well dispersed in water and only the nylon support remained (Fig. 3c). But after modification with CTAB, the RMMs became hydrophobic with a surface contact angle of 105.1° because of the exposed hexadecyl chains of CTAB on the surface (Fig. S7b†). In contrast, when the RMMs were soaked in water, they stayed intact for more than 6 months (Fig. 3d, g and j). More surprisingly, no visible damage or delamination was observed when the RMMs were shaken in water for more than 24 h (Fig. 3e, h and k), and only negligible damage was observed after ultrasonication for more than 5 min (Fig. 3f and i). The RMMs were eventually damaged after 10 min of ultrasonication. We also recorded XRD patterns of the RMM before and after hydration (Fig. S8†). The hydration only led to a very marginal increase in the interlayer distance, showing a highly stable microstructure. The RMMs can also maintain their original structure in strong acidic and basic solutions for months (Fig. S9†). High stability in various solvents is essential for many liquid-phase applications of the RMMs.

The RMMs with a thickness of 11.2 μm were used to investigate the ion transport properties by using Ag/AgCl electrodes to measure the current–voltage (I–V) responses across the membrane in a potassium chloride (KCl) electrolyte (Fig. 4a inset). Representative I–V characteristics for the RMMs are linear in KCl solutions of various concentrations (Fig. 4a). Generally, the conductance is proportional to the concentration of the bulk solution.18 When a solid surface is exposed to a fluid, the counter ion is attracted due to the presence of solid surface charges, resulting in a greater counter ion concentration near the solid surface than in the bulk solution. At the same time, a counter ion concentration gradient is generated, which diffuses from the solid surface to the bulk solution. This structure is called an electrical double layer (EDL). For the RMM transmembrane system, at high salt concentrations, because of the very thin EDL in the nanochannels, the ionic conductance is determined by the concentration of the bulk electrolyte solution, while at lower concentrations of below 10−1 M (Fig. 4b), due to the overlap of the EDL, this ionic conductance begins to deviate from bulk behavior and then converges to a saturated value, showing strong surface charge controlled ion transport properties.14,19,20 Estimated based on the Debye–Hückel approximation, the height of the 2D nanochannels should be greater than 1 nm and less than 3 nm,14,17 which is consistent with XRD results shown in Fig. 2h.

Inset: scheme of the experimental setup. (d) Power generation for the RMM with salt concentration gradients of 10, 100, and 1000. 
To further confirm the ion selectivity of the negatively charged RMM, the net diffusive ionic current was recorded without externally applied voltage (Fig. 4c inset). Three salts concentration gradients (Chigh/Clow = 10, 100, and 1000, Clow = 1.0 mM) across the RMM at pH 3, 6, and 10 were investigated. As shown in Fig. 4c, the magnitude of the diffusion current increased as the applied concentration gradient was changed from 10- to 1000-fold. The increase in pH led to a stronger surface charge which promoted the generation of diffusion current as well (Fig. 2d).14
The osmotic power generation was tested by measuring the electroosmotic potentials and currents with various KCl concentration gradients across the RMMs. As shown in Fig. 4d, both the open-circuit voltage (UOC: intercepts on the voltage axis) and short-circuit current (ISC: intercepts on the current axis) increase along with the increase of salt concentration gradient from 10- to 1000-fold. We also observed that the direction of the measured diffusion current was consistent with the net flow of the positive charges from high- to low-concentration reservoirs, which also suggests that the nanochannels are cation-selective.60 The maximum output electric power (Pmax) can be directly calculated using the equation Pmax = UOC × ISC/4. Under very weak acidic conditions (pH ≈ 6), the output power density of the energy harvesting system was estimated to be 0.18 W m−2 under a 1000-fold salt concentration gradient (Fig. S10†). Moreover, the cation transference number (t+) of the RMM approaches 0.93 under a 10-fold salt concentration difference, corresponding to an electrochemical energy conversion efficiency of ca. 35.3% (ESI†), which is comparable with that of other 2D material systems in salinity energy conversion.13,14,20,61
To further confirm the selective behavior for small organic molecules through the nanofluidic channels of the RMMs, we also tested the permeability and separation performance through pressure-driven filtration. The permeability of the RMMs with thicknesses from 2.5 to 8.7 μm was investigated (Fig. S11†). The water permeance decreased (from 750 to 33 L m−2 h−1 atm−1) exponentially with an increase of the RMM thickness, which is consistent with other separation membranes due to the increase of mass transfer resistance.22Fig. 5 summarizes the separation performance of the RMMs for various dyes. It can be found that the permeances of MB (1.6 × 0.8 nm in dimension62) and MO (1.6 × 1.0 nm in dimension63) solutions show similar values, which are much higher than that of an RB (1.8 × 1.4 nm in dimension44) solution (Fig. 5a). For the rejection in Fig. 5b, although water permeance decreased, the dye rejection increased with an increase in membrane thickness. The rejections for RB reached 94%, 96%, and 99% with thicknesses of 2.5, 3.8, and 6.4 μm, respectively, which are much higher than those for MB and MO. This is mainly because RB molecules have a comparable size with the nanochannels in RMMs (and are much larger than MB and MO), and thus they are more likely to block the nanochannels, leading to low permeance and high rejection.44,62
 Fig. 5  Separation performance of the RMMs. (a) Permeance of MB, MO, and RB (organic dyes: 5 μM) through the RMMs with thicknesses of 2.5, 3.8, and 6.4 μm. (b) Rejection of MB, MO, and RB of the RMMs with thicknesses of 2.5, 3.8, and 6.4 μm. (c) Permeance and rejection comparison of the RMM with that of other separation membranes reported in the literature.62,64–69 UV-vis absorption spectra and photographs of the feed and the permeate of (d) MB, (e) MO, and (f) RB solution after filtration using the RMM (6.4 μm). 
The rejection for positively charged MB is much lower than that for negatively charged MO. In general, the positively charged molecules are easier to be taken up by negatively charged membranes via electrostatic interactions. As a result, the nanochannels are easier to be blocked, resulting in a higher rejection for cationic dyes.64 However, in our system, since the CTAB molecules serve as pillars in the structure of the nanochannels, when the negatively charged MO molecules pass through, CTA+ coagulation occurs due to electrostatic adsorption, leading to clogging of the channels. The results indicate that electrostatic interaction in the interlayer space dominates the adsorption of the dye molecules. Note that the weak electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged dyes and RMMs could promote their rejection to some extent as well.27 The positively charged MB molecules are adsorbed on the negatively charged MMT surface and do not block the channels, thus having a lower rejection (Fig. 5b). The 2.5 μm thick RMM shows a water permeance of 429 L m−2 h−1 atm−1, higher than that of some reported membranes with an even lower thickness. Meanwhile, the rejection performance also reached an average level for the separation membranes in the literature (Fig. S12† and 5c). In addition, most of the nanochannels in the RMM are hydrophobic due to the existence of CTA+, which creates slip flow boundary conditions inside the nanochannels to enhance the fluidic velocity.70 Moreover, the hydroxyl groups on the edge of MMT nanosheets are hydrophilic, while the nanochannels are hydrophobic; the alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic nanochannels can further promote the permeance.71Fig. 5d–f show the typical rejection performance of 6.4 μm-thick RMMs. The UV-visible absorption spectra of the feed and permeate solutions show significant differences before and after filtration through the RMMs. The color of the three feed solutions also changed from blue (MB), yellow (MO), and pink (RB) to colorless, showing a nearly perfect separation performance.
Conclusions
In summary, we prepared free-standing MMT-based membranes with nanofluidic energy conversion behavior and high separation efficiency by restacking modified individual MMT nanosheets. The modifier CTAB not only supports the nanochannels as pillars, but also plays a significant role in capturing dye molecules. The RMMs showed high stability in water under soaking, shaking, and even brief ultrasonication conditions. The RMMs can be used for salinity gradient energy conversion. An output power density of 0.18 W m−2 was achieved under a 1000-fold salt concentration gradient with a membrane thickness of 11.2 μm. These membranes also showed water permeance of 429 L m−2 h−1 atm−1 with a thickness of 2.5 μm, higher than other membranes with the same thickness. They also show high separation efficiency for both positive and negative dyes. The combination of nanofluidic ionic transport and molecular separation through 2D channels presents valuable features to create new smart multifunctional membranes that can be used for collecting energy while purifying wastewater.
