    , Accepted 6th February 2013First published on 8th February 2013AbstractThe geometries, electronic structures and absorption spectra of two unsymmetrical squaraine dyes (SQ1 and SQ2) were theoretically investigated by using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT). The dye-(TiO2)9 nanocluster systems were also simulated to show the electronic coupling at the interface. The results reveal that compared to SQ1, SQ2 with an electron-rich thiophene spacer and a strongly π-accepting carboxycyanovinyl group could cause a red shift of the absorption spectrum, increase the oscillator strength and improve the light harvesting efficiency, thus leading to the larger short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), in good agreement with experimental data. While the larger normal dipole moment pointing outward from the semiconductor surface of SQ2 is the major factor resulting in the higher open-circuit photovoltage (VOC). Then, we designed another six dyes with different π-spacers to screen dyes with improved performance. The results indicate that SQ6, SQ7 and SQ8 with benzathiadiazole, bithiophene and thienothiophene spacer, respectively, will be more efficient squaraine dyes used in DSSCs. This study is expected to assist the design and synthesis of novel squaraine dyes.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted considerable attention due to the low-cost fabrication and high power conversion efficiencies.1 In the DSSC process, the dye sensitizer first absorbs a photon to generate the photo-excited state of the dye. The excited electron is then quickly injected into the conduction band (CB) of the semiconductor (e.g., TiO2) while the resultant oxidized dye is reduced back to its neutral state by the iodide redox couple with the positive charge being transported from the electrolyte to the counter electrode. Therefore, the overall cell efficiency strongly depends on several factors: (i) light-harvesting efficiency of the dye for solar spectrum; (ii) electron injection probability from the excited state of the dye to the semiconductor (efficiency of the charge separation); (iii) electron transfer probability from the electrolyte to the oxidized dye.2
The sensitizer plays a vital role in the light-harvesting, charge separation as well as the overall conversion efficiency of the corresponding cell. Up to now, polypyridyl ruthenium sensitizers have achieved up to 11% conversion efficiencies under standard air mass (AM) 1.5 simulated solar irradiation.3–5 However, the main drawback of ruthenium-based sensitizers is the lack of absorption and the low molar extinction coefficients in the red and near-infrared (NIR) regions, limiting further improvement in efficiency. To improve the performances of DSSCs further, it would be very useful to develop effective new NIR sensitizers for use in DSSCs, because red/NIR radiation (600–1000 nm) accounts for about 25% of the solar energy arriving on the Earth's surface.
Squaraines are well-known for their extremely high extinction coefficients, inherent stability and intense absorption in the red/NIR regions, and as a result have been widely investigated as red/NIR sensitizers.6–15 Grätzel and co-workers9 reported a symmetrical squaraine dye, incorporating two carboxylic acid attaching groups, successfully used in both liquid and solid-state DSSCs with 3.7% and 1.5% efficiencies, respectively. An overall conversion efficiency (η) of 4.5% has been obtained using the unsymmetrical indoline-terminated dye (E)-2-((Z)-(5-carboxy-3,3-dimethyl-1-octylindolin-2-ylidene)methyl)-4-((1-ethyl-3,3-dimethyl-3H-indolium-2-yl)methylene)-3-oxocyclobut-1-enolate (SQ1, Fig. 1).10 More recently, Marder and co-workers15 developed a novel unsymmetrical squaraine (E)-2-((Z)-(5-(5-((E)-2-carboxy-2-cyanovinyl)thiophen-2-yl)-1-dodecyl-3,3-dimethylindolin-2-ylidene)methyl)-4-((1-ethyl-3,3-dimethyl-3H-indolium-2-yl)methylene)-3-oxocyclobut-1-enolate (YR6, renamed as SQ2 in this study, Fig. 1), which incorporates more extended conjugation beyond the squaraine core than SQ1, as well as the more strongly π-accepting carboxycyanovinyl group as an anchoring group instead of a directly attached carboxylic acid. Under standard AM 1.5 solar conditions, the liquid cell sensitized with SQ2 gave a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 14.8 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 642 mV and a fill factor (FF) of 0.71, corresponding to an overall efficiency of 6.74%, which is the highest conversion efficiency so far reported for squaraine-based DSSCs. Understanding how and why the chemical modifications bearing the acceptor tune the electronic and spectroscopic properties of squaraines should guide future computational and experimental studies to keep improving the conversion efficiencies of squaraine dyes.

With the rapid development of experimental studies of DSSCs, large-scale quantum mechanical calculations have been an extremely powerful and comparably low-cost tool for the interpretation of the experimental data and for the beforehand molecular designs of new efficient dyes. The state-of-the-art computational methodologies based on density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) can provide reliable geometrical, electronic and spectroscopic properties for various dyes,16–41 along with their ground- and excited-state oxidation potentials. Although squaraine dyes have been extensively studied from experimental methods in recent years, there are relatively few theoretical studies about them.11,39–41
In this work, motivated by the fact that the small modification of squaraine dyes could induce significantly different cell performance, we performed DFT and TD-DFT calculations on the geometries, electronic structures and absorption spectra of two representative squaraine dyes (SQ1 and SQ2) to attempt to provide insight into the physical origin underlying this difference. Some key parameters controlling the short-circuit photocurrent density and the open-circuit voltage, including the light harvesting efficiency (LHE), the injecting driving force (ΔGinject.), the vertical dipole moment (μnormal) and the adsorption angle (θ), were theoretically discussed in detail. The dye/(TiO2)9 anatase nanocluster systems were also simulated to show the electronic structures at the interface. Then, with SQ2 as a prototype, six novel dyes (SQ3–SQ6) were designed by changing the π-spacer (including furan, phenyl, 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene, benzathiadiazole, bithiophene and thienothiophene) to screen more efficient squaraine dyes. The results reveal that SQ6, SQ7 and SQ8 with benzathiadiazole, bithiophene and thienothiophene spacer represent potential alternatives to SQ2 due to the improved performances.
2. Computational details
All calculations were carried out with the Gaussian 09 package.42 The ground-state geometries of the squaraine dyes were fully optimized without any symmetry constraints at the DFT level with the B3LYP hybrid functional43,44 using a standard 6-31G(d) basis set on all atoms, which has been widely used for the theoretical investigations of organic dyes for DSSCs.20,45 The excitation energies and oscillator strengths for the lowest 30 singlet-singlet transitions at the optimized geometries were first calculated within the TD-DFT methodology using the 6-31G(d) basis set and six different functionals: B3LYP, BHandH,46 long-range corrected (LC) ωPBE,47,48 ωB97X,49 ωB97XD50 and CAM-B3LYP.51 The UV-vis spectra are very sensitive to the basis set extension, and the simultaneous addition of extra polarization, diffuse and valence functions would lead to about 15 nm change of spectra. Thus, 6-31G(d) and 6 − 311 + G(2d, 2p) basis sets were then used to examine how the basis set has an effect on predicting the excitation properties. The linear-response conductor polarizable continuum model (LR-CPCM)52,53 was adopted here to include the bulk solvent effects. The electronic UV-vis spectra were simulated using the SWizard program (Revision 4.6)54 with the full width at half-maximum of 3000 cm−1.
The (TiO2)9 nanocluster as described by Yamashita et al.55 was used to model the adsorption of dyes on TiO2. Sánchez-de-Armas and coworkers56–58 have demonstrated that (TiO2)9 is able to simulate semiquantitatively the main features in the electronic structure of the system, although it may be a little simplification as compared to the commonly used (TiO2)38 cluster. The structures of the (TiO2)9 nanocluster and the dye/TiO2 nanoparticle interface were optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. After optimization, the adsorption energies (Eads) of dyes on the (TiO2)9 cluster were obtained using the equation:  Eads = Edye + ETiO2 – Edye + TiO2(1)where Edye is the total energy of isolated dye, ETiO2 is the total energy of (TiO2)9 cluster, and Edye + TiO2 is the total energy of dye-(TiO2)9 complex, respectively. A positive value of Eads thus corresponds to a thermodynamically favored adsorption process.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Free dyes
The optimized ground-state geometries of the SQ1 and SQ2 dyes are shown in Fig. 1. The carboxylic anchoring group, the indole ring and the squaraine core are fully conjugated across the π orbitals of the CC double bonds as demonstrated by the coplanarity of these fragments. The thiophene group in SQ2 is also π-conjugated to the indole ring although these units are not fully coplanar but tilted by about 17° due mainly to the steric repulsion between the hydrogen atom on the indole and thiophene rings. The delocalization in the conjugate fragments is helpful for the electron transfer and for the stability of the molecule.
The charge transfer orientation is associated with the distribution of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the sensitizer. The HOMO of the whole molecule should be mainly localized at the donor moiety and the LUMO at the acceptor moiety. The selected frontier molecular orbital (MO) isosurfaces as well as the charge density difference between the excited and ground state of the SQ1 and SQ2 dyes are depicted in Fig. 2. The occupied orbitals for both dyes show similar features. The HOMO-1 is quite localized within the squaraine core, while the HOMO is delocalized throughout the molecule, both deriving from the π-framework of the molecule. For SQ1, the LUMO is a π* orbital delocalized throughout the molecule with notable contributions arising from the carboxylic group, while the LUMO+1 is essentially centered on the carboxylic group. The LUMO and LUMO+1 for SQ2 contain comparable electron distributions, with larger contributions of the carboxycyanovinyl and thiophene groups, which could lead to a strong electronic coupling with the TiO2 surface and thus boost the electron injection efficiency.59 The frontier molecular orbital spatial distributions indicate an orientational spatial separation of HOMO and LUMO. The regions of the density increment (yellow in Fig. 2) computed for the first electronic transition are mostly located on the anchoring/acceptor moiety. Thus, the first electronic transition of these dyes induced by light irradiation could move the electron distributions on the π–π* framework towards the anchoring group. This vectorial charge-transfer transition character has been proven to be beneficial for the rapid interfacial electron injection from the excited dye to the TiO2 CB and could also slow down the recombination of injected electrons in TiO2 with the oxidized dyes due to their remoteness.60 At the same time, the electronic delocalization along the π-framework ensures some overlap between the ground and excited states, which is important for achieving good molar extinction coefficients. Comparing the frontier orbital features, it can be found that the incorporation of the electron-rich thiophene group and the strongly π-accepting carboxycyanovinyl group in SQ2 leads to an expanded π-conjugation, which will enhance the unidirectional charge transfer towards the anchoring/acceptor group and improve the sensitizer performance. The different long alkyl chains in SQ1 and SQ2 have been proven not to change the electronic structures.61

The contour thresholds for molecular orbitals and densities are 0.02 and 0.003 a.u., respectively. The yellow (blue) color indicates an increase (decrease) of charge density in a given molecular region. 
In DSSC principle, the LUMO level of the dye must be situated above the CB of TiO2 for effective electron injection, while the HOMO should be more positive than the I−/I3− redox couple for efficient regeneration of the oxidized dye. From an energetic point of view, the HOMO is practically isoenergetic in the two dyes, and only a very small stabilization energy is computed between SQ1 and SQ2 (0.02 eV). On the contrary, the LUMO of SQ1 is computed at a significantly higher energy (roughly 0.24 eV) than that of SQ2, indicating that the carboxycyanovinyl group is indeed a stronger electron acceptor with respect to the carboxyl acid group. For both dyes considered here, the simulated LUMOs lie above the CB edge of TiO2 (−4.00 eV vs. vacuum),62 thus providing the thermodynamic driving force for favorable interfacial electron injection from the excited dye to the CB edge of TiO2. Relatively large energy gaps between the LUMO energies of these dyes and the semiconductor CB would be beneficial to the photovoltaic conversion efficiencies. On the other hand, the HOMOs of these dyes lie below the iodide redox potential (−4.60 eV vs. vacuum),60 leading to a fast dye regeneration and avoiding the geminate charge recombination between oxidized dye molecules and photo-injected electrons in the TiO2 film. The SQ1 dye has a HOMO–LUMO gap of 2.24 eV while SQ2 shows this gap of 1.98 eV. As expected, the HOMO–LUMO gap of SQ1 is slightly larger than that of SQ2 due to the increased length of the latter dye.
To better understand the excited states giving rise to the intense absorption spectra of the SQ1 and SQ2 dyes, TD-DFT calculations were performed based on the optimized ground-state geometries. The 30 lowest singlet–singlet transitions, up to an energy of 4.96 eV (250 nm), were taken into account. The establishment of an efficient computational framework highly depends on the appropriate choice of functionals and basis sets. Firstly, the vertical transitions from the S0 state to the S1 state were calculated in the frame of TD-DFT/LR-CPCM/6-31G(d) to evaluate the functional effects. Table 1 presents a comparison between the calculated maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) using different functionals and the experimental λmax for SQ1 and SQ2. The excitation energies from TD-DFT calculations are generally within a 0.4 eV deviation from experimental data, and for organic dyes the average errors are frequently smaller than this upper limit. For instance, Guillaumont and Nakamura simulated the λmax of several organic dyes (indigo, azobenzene, phenylamine, hydrazone, and anthraquinone) with an average deviation close to 0.20 eV.63 The B3LYP functional could not reproduce the relative transition probabilities (intensities) between SQ1 and SQ2, although the λmax values from this functional agree a little better with the experimental data.10,15 BHandH overestimates the λmax values very significantly (0.32 and 0.27 eV for SQ1 and SQ2, respectively). The other functionals with long-range corrections (LC-ωPBE, ωB97X, ωB97XD and CAM-B3LYP) overestimate the λmax values with absolute deviations of about 0.20 eV, consistent with the accuracy level expected at this level of theory.64 Blue-shifted theoretical values of the transition energies are quite common for squaraine dyes,11,65–67 which can be attributed to the inherent approximations in TD-DFT.68 Cyanine-like transition cannot be easily modeled with vertical TD-DFT.69 The results indicate that the functionals have a remarkable effect on the vertical transition energies and the long-range-corrected functionals are more suitable for the spectra calculation. Head-Gordon and coworkers70 evaluated the performance of several hybrid density functionals on the electronic excitations and also found that the range-separated functionals provide more accurate estimates. On the basis of the agreement with the experimental data, LC-ωPBE is the functional of choice for the UV-vis spectra calculation.

The selection of a basis set in the computation of molecular electronically excited states becomes crucial if one intends to obtain accurate results.64 Usually, diffusion functions and polarization functions improve the calculated accuracy but at the expense of increased computational effort. The compromise is to carry out computations using small basis sets and check for convergence using large basis sets. This is especially important for molecular design, the ultimate purpose of which is to predict molecular properties using inexpensive calculations. Therefore, we calculated the vertical transitions using LC-ωPBE/6-31G(d) and LC-ωPBE/6 − 311 + g(2d,2p) based on the optimized ground-state geometries, respectively. Table 2 shows the basis set effect on the excitation energy of SQ1 and SQ2. There are no significant changes in the λmax values when additional polarization, diffuse, or valence functions are included, indicating that 6-31G(d) is a satisfying basis set for the TD-DFT calculations of the as-investigated squaraine dyes.

The vertical excitation energies and oscillator strengths along with the main excitation configurations of both dyes calculated by LC-ωPBE/CPCM/6-31G(d) are listed in Table 3. The corresponding simulated absorption spectra are depicted in Fig. 3. The calculated line shape and relative strength agree well with those of the experiment, and the overall spectral red-shift and enhanced molar absorption coefficient when going from SQ1 to SQ2 (SQ1: 158 500 dm3 mol−1 cm−1 and SQ2: 279 000 dm3 mol−1 cm−1)are also correctly reproduced.10,15 The first band for both dyes clearly corresponds to the previously described HOMO–LUMO transition, and is of charge transfer character thus possessing high transition intensity. The additional absorption of SQ2 centered at 381.8 nm is significant (f = 0.8278) compared to that of SQ1, which shows negligible absorption in the 350–450 nm range. This band, corresponding to a π–π* transition with strong HOMO-1 to LUMO, HOMO-1 to LUMO+1 and HOMO to LUMO+1 compositions, also has a charge transfer character as demonstrated by the frontier molecular orbital distributions in Fig. 2. In addition, it also can be inferred that the charge transfer transition absorption of SQ2 with the extension of π-conjugation is larger than that of the shorter π-conjugation of SQ1.

3.2 Dye–titania complexes
Theoretical studies of the dye–TiO2 interacting system require effective simulations of the electronic properties of TiO2 nanoparticles. Herein, a (TiO2)9 nanocluster was used to model the TiO2 nanoparticles, which has been demonstrated to be large enough to simulate semiquantitatively all the features in the electronic structure of the system by Sánchez-de-Armas et al.56–58 In addition, the adsorption of dyes on the TiO2 surface through the carboxylic group can be either physisorption (via hydrogen bonding between an oxygen atom on TiO2 and a hydrogen atom of the carboxylic group of the dye) or chemisorption (the hydrogen atom of carboxylic acid dissociates and the bond is formed between the carboxylic oxygen atoms and the penta-coordinated surface titanium atoms of TiO2 which can be of monodentate ester, bidentate chelating, or bidentate bridging modes).71 However, Fourier transform infrared experiments indicated that the carboxylic acid group is usually adsorbed on TiO2 through bidentate bridging mode.71,72 Therefore, only the bidentate bridging adsorption mode was considered in this study.
The optimized structures for the dye–TiO2 complexes are shown in Fig. 4, and the important bond distances and adsorption energies are listed in Table 4. The computed adsorption energies are sufficiently large to allow the assumption that the dye molecules are chemisorbed on the cluster. After adsorption to the (TiO2)9 cluster, the squaraines almost maintain their structures, except that the anchoring groups are twisted by about 8° in the case of SQ1 and 5° for SQ2. The bond distances between the carboxylic oxygen atoms and the Ti atoms (O–Ti bond) of SQ1–TiO2 complex are 1.956 and 2.148 Å. For the SQ2–TiO2 complex, these bond distances are 1.987 and 2.140 Å. The average O–Ti bond distance of SQ1–TiO2 is slightly shorter than that of SQ2–TiO2, indicating that a slightly stronger binding of the SQ1 dye with the TiO2 cluster and probably stronger electronic coupling. This trend is in agreement with the decreasing adsorption energies computed when going from SQ1 to SQ2.

To gain insight into the electronic coupling between the dye LUMO and the TiO2 CB as well as the electron-transfer features during light excitation, we analyzed the frontier MO of the dye/(TiO2)9 system. The frontier MO isosurfaces for the dye-TiO2 complexes are given in Fig. 4. The HOMO of the dye-TiO2 is entirely localized on the adsorbate dyes, whereas the LUMO is delocalized over the carboxylic acid group of dyes and the TiO2 surface, which represents the interacting orbitals between the dye LUMO and the TiO2 CB. These results indicate that the electron injection through the anchoring group from the dye LUMO to the TiO2 CB is directly induced from the intermolecular charge transfer process of this system. Fig. 5 shows the density of states for the as-investigated dyes before and after binding to the TiO2 cluster. The corresponding deviations between the dye-TiO2 complexes and TiO2 are also depicted. The HOMOs of the dyes are almost unaffected by interaction with TiO2, inserting within the TiO2 band gap and showing the alignment of the energy levels as in the no-interacting case. The most noticeable difference between the isolated and interacting systems is in the position and character of the LUMOs. After adsorption to the TiO2 cluster, the dye LUMOs decrease due to the interaction with TiO2, in agreement with previous reports on the perylene dye and TiO2 cluster.73 The LUMO of SQ1 is 0.16 eV lower after binding to the TiO2 cluster. While for the SQ2–TiO2 complex, the lower-lying LUMO is calculated to be a smaller 0.14 eV, indicating slightly weaker electronic coupling to the TiO2 cluster than the SQ1–TiO2 complex (consistent also with the previously discussed adsorption energies).

3.3 Theoretical parameters to evaluate efficiency
The overall conversion efficiency η of DSSCs is determined by the short-circuit photocurrent density, the open-circuit photovoltage, and the fill factor:  (2)where Pin is the incident photon flux. The photocurrent density JSC is related to the interaction between TiO2 and the sensitizer, as well as the absorption coefficient of the sensitizer; while VOC corresponds to the difference between the Fermi level of the electron in TiO2 and the redox potential of the electrolyte.
Quantitatively, the JSC in DSSCs is determined by the following equation:  (3)where LHE(λ) is the light-harvesting efficiency related to the oscillator strength (f) at a given wavelength, Φinj is the electron injection efficiency, and ηcoll is the electron collection efficiency. For the same DSSCs with only different dyes, it is reasonable to assume that the ηcoll is a constant. As a result, LHE and Φinj are the two main factors influencing the JSC.
To obtain a high JSC, the efficient dye used in DSSCs should have a large LHE, which is expressed as:32 LHE = 1 − 10−A = 1 − 10−f(4)where A (f) is the absorption (oscillator strength) of the dye corresponding to the λmax. From SQ1 to SQ2, the increasing f gives rise to an increasing LHE parameter (0.9784 for SQ1 and 0.9900 for SQ2, Table 5). The increase of the LHE factor is related to the more delocalizable structure arising from the electron-rich thiophene group and the strongly electron-drawing carboxycyanovinyl group, although the nonplanar conformation caused by the thiophene group tends to hamper the electronic conjugation and results in a decrease of the charge-transfer oscillator strength.74 In addition, the presence of additional absorption of SQ2 at shorter wavelengths can further enhance the total LHE due to the resulting good overlap with the solar spectrum.

Besides the LHE, the electron injection efficiency Φinj could also influence JSC, which is closely related to the driving force (ΔGinject.) of the electron injection from the photoinduced excited states of the sensitizer to the CB of the semiconductor. A larger driving force is desirable for more rapid and efficient electron injection and then higher photocurrent of DSSCs. Preat and coworkers33 have proposed a theoretical scheme to quantify the electron injection onto a TiO2 surface. The free energy change ΔGinject. (in eV) for the electron injection can be expressed by the following equation:75 ΔGinject. = Edye*OX − ESCCB(5)where Edye*OX is the oxidation potential of the dye in the excited state, and ESCCB is the reduction potential of the semiconductor CB (ESCCB= 4.00 eV62). Assuming that the electron injection occurs from the unrelaxed excited state, Edye*OX can be expressed as:  Edye*OX = EdyeOX − λmax(6)where EdyeOX is the redox potential of the ground state, and λmax is the vertical transition energy (in eV). The calculated ΔGinject., as well as EdyeOX and Edye*OX for both squaraine dyes are listed in Table 5. It can be found that both the calculated ΔGinject. are very negative (≤−1.26 eV), which means that the dye excited state lies above the CB edge of TiO2, favoring the injection of the electron from the excited-state dye to the TiO2 CB. Moreover, although SQ1 shows a slightly more negative ΔGinject. than SQ2, basically the values are similar. Thus, from the LHE and the driving force, we could expect that the cell sensitized by SQ2 should have larger JSC than that by SQ1, in agreement with the experimental observations10,15 (14.8 mA cm−2vs. 10.23 mA cm−2 for the devices using similar layer thickness).
The open-circuit photovoltage VOC in DSSCs can be determined by:76 (7)where Ec is the CB edge of the semiconductor, Eredox is the electrolyte Fermi-level, kT is the thermal energy, q is the unit charge, nc is the number of electrons in the CB, and NCB is the accessible density of CB states. Upon the adsorption of dyes onto the semiconductor, the shift of Ec could be expressed as a function of the dipole moment of adsorbed dye as:77 (8)where q is the electron charge, ε0 and ε are the permittivity of the vacuum and the dielectric constant of the organic monolayer, γ is the dye's surface concentration, and μnormal is the component of dipole moment of the individual molecule perpendicular to the semiconductor surface. Grätzel and coworkers have proven theoretically that the larger the μnormal of the molecules pointing outward from the semiconductor surface, the larger the VOC.78 Thus, the dipole moments of the free dyes were calculated by B3LYP/6-31G(d) at the geometry of dyes adsorbed onto TiO2. Considering the bidentate binding model of the dyes, the orientations of the dyes after binding to TiO2 were simulated by making the C2 axis of the carboxylate in the dye parallel to the x-axis, and the TiO2 surface parallel to the yz plane.
The calculated total and normal dipole moments are shown in Table 5 and Fig. 6. The total dipole moment of SQ1 is much lower than that of SQ2, due to its relatively slight departure from centrosymmetry. Both dyes show normal dipole moments pointing outward from the TiO2 cluster. SQ2 has a significantly larger μnormal than SQ1 (6.47 D >1.47 D), which can lead to more negative charges located close to the TiO2 cluster, and thus result in a larger CB energy level upshift as well as a larger VOC. However, the molecule's total dipole moments are not vertical to the TiO2 cluster, although the dyes are almost vertically adsorbed onto the TiO2 cluster. As we know, the injected electron in the semiconductor CB could also recombine with the redox couple in the electrolyte and exert a detrimental effect on the VOC. Thus, the adsorption form which considerably affects the interfacial charge recombination should be also taken into account to relate the VOC. The adsorption angle θ is decreased from 54.6° to 31.0° when the π system is extended. While the θ is decreased along with the extended π system, the blocking moiety (indoline group in these dyes) could not cover the π segment and TiO2 surface anymore and leave them open to the electrolyte, which would cause the charge recombination between I3− and the excited electrons in the TiO2 CB. Moreover, the bound I3− would be brought very close to TiO2 by the low-lying binding site with the decreasing θ, also resulting in the interfacial charge recombination. Therefore, we believe that the slightly larger experimental VOC of SQ2 (642 and 590 mV for SQ2 and SQ1 for the devices using similar layer thickness, respectively)10,15 is ascribed to the larger μnormal for SQ2, which compensates well for the smaller θ than that of SQ1. Although the difference in VOC for SQ1 and SQ2 has been demonstrated, it needs to be pointed out that the VOC is also determined by other important factors. For example, Mozer and coworkers have described that a remarkably reduced electron lifetime in porphyrin-based DSSCs is the origin of the generally lower VOC than for Ru sensitizer.79

3.4 Effects of chemical modifications
To further explore the conjugation effects and to assist the design of more efficient squaraine dyes for DSSCs, six theoretically possible dyes SQ3–SQ8 (as shown in Fig. 7) were investigated, which are derived from SQ2. From SQ3 to SQ8, the π spacers are furan, phenyl, 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene, benzathiadiazole, bithiophene and thienothiophene, respectively. The performances of these dyes were evaluated by taking SQ2 as a reference dye, with the next three criteria: (1) LHE must be larger than 0.9900 with a red-shift absorption spectrum to optimize the photocurrent response; (2) the free energy of injection should be more negative than, or at least comparable to, −1.27 eV; (3) the normal dipole moment and the adsorption angle should not be lower than 6.47 D and 31.0°, respectively. The calculated parameters for SQ3–SQ8 are collected in Table 5. Considering these parameters, the squaraine derivatives investigated here show the following trends: (1) for SQ3, the μnormal and θ values are significantly smaller than those of SQ2, indicating that SQ3 would show lower open-voltage and poorer overall performance, although the light-harvesting and the driving force of SQ3 are comparable to those of SQ2; (2) SQ4 and SQ5 show slightly deteriorated θ and μnormal values as well as no significant difference in the other parameters with respect to SQ2, implying that SQ4 and SQ5 possibly show similarly good performances to SQ2; (3) for SQ6, SQ7 and SQ8, the values of ΔGinject., μnormal and θ are improved while the LHE value is comparable to SQ2, implying that these dyes are very promising to provide better performances as sensitizers in DSSCs. In fact, the benzathiadiazole, bithiophene and thienothiophene units have been widely used as spacers to improve the performance of donor–acceptor (D–A) dyes.60,80,81

4. Conclusions
In this work, DFT/TD-DFT calculations were performed to study the structural, electronic and absorption features of two unsymmetrical squaraine dyes (SQ1 and SQ2). Dye-(TiO2)9 nanocluster systems were simulated to show the electronic coupling at the interface. The results show that the introduction of electron-rich thiophene group and strongly π-accepting carboxycyanovinyl group in SQ2 gives rise to a smaller HOMO–LUMO gap, a red-shifted absorption spectrum with higher extinction coefficients, but a weaker coupling with the TiO2 surface. Some parameters such as the light harvesting efficiency, the injecting driving force, the vertical dipole moment and the adsorption angle have been discussed comprehensively to rationalize the difference in overall conversion efficiency of DSSCs based on SQ1 and SQ2. The larger short-circuit photocurrent density and open-circuit photovoltage of SQ2 are ascribed to the larger light harvesting efficiency and the larger normal dipole moment, respectively. The calculated results show good agreement with the experimental evidences, demonstrating the soundness of the theoretical approaches presented here. Furthermore, as compared with SQ2, we find that the driving force, the normal dipole moment and the adsorption angle of SQ6–SQ8 could be improved by replacing thiophene with benzathiadiazole, bithiophene and thienothiophene, while the light harvesting efficiency is similar. Therefore, SQ6–SQ8 dyes are expected to show better performances in the DSSC field than SQ2. We hope this work will be helpful for the design of more efficient squaraine dyes, reducing economical cost and synthesis effort.
