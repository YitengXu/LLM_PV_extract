    , Accepted 5th March 2014First published on 6th March 2014AbstractWe report efficient panchromatic light harvesting by co-adsorption of a porphyrin molecule and N719 in dye-sensitized solar cells. The co-sensitized device shows a considerably enhanced power conversion efficiency of 8.89%, while those individually sensitized by porphyrin and N719 display efficiencies of 7.21% and 8.02%, respectively. The porphyrin-sensitized device shows strong photocurrent generation in the Soret and Q bands, while N719 shows efficient spectral response in the 500–600 nm range; the combination of these two kinds of dye molecules displays a strong spectral response in the full-colour region. Mechanistic investigations are carried out by various spectral and electrochemical characterizations.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted increasing interest in recent years due to the economical and ecological device fabrication and reasonably high power conversion efficiency (PCE, η).1,2 In such device structures, a dye sensitizer harvests sunlight and injects electrons into the conduction band of a semiconducting oxide; the dye is then regenerated through a redox reaction. During the past decade, tremendous effort has been made to optimize every single component of the DSSCs,3–7 which in turn provide a lot of practical and fundamental insight into device operation.8–10 It has been realized that the light harvesting efficiency plays a key role in determining the final PCE.
One approach to extend the light response is to develop new dye molecules to cover a broad solar spectrum. Because the design of new dye molecules requires intricate play between the narrowing of the energy gap of the dye molecules, efficient charge injection and the dye regeneration limit, this sets a barrier for the design of dye molecules. Furthermore, though the design of molecules can be performed with theoretical prediction, the practical synthesis is not necessarily achievable. This is probably one of the most important reasons why the improvement of the energy conversion efficiency in DSSCs has not been that rapid. In dye molecule development, there are several classes of molecules possessing strong light responses in their respective regions. Therefore, an alternative approach to improve the light harvesting by a device would be sensitizing the device using multiple, complementary dye molecules to achieve a broad range light response.9,11–18 In addition, other methods such as the use of energy relay dye molecules or plasmonic metal nanoparticles can also enhance light harvesting in DSSCs.19,20
In this work, we developed a push–pull porphyrin dye (denoted as HD18) and co-sensitized it with the state-of-the-art N719 dye molecules for the enhancement of the spectral response. Typically, porphyrin-based dyes possess high extinction coefficients in the Soret (400–500 nm) and Q (600–700 nm) absorption bands; hence, sunlight with wavelengths in these ranges could be completely harvested in optimized device structures.1,21,22 However, one disadvantage of porphyrin dyes is that they have a relatively small absorption coefficient in the region between the two bands (500–600 nm), while the solar spectrum possesses a major portion of light in this region. This spectral characteristic sets a photovoltaic energy conversion limit in porphyrin-sensitized solar cells. On the other hand, the state-of-the-art ruthenium-based dyes (e.g. N719) exhibit excellent photovoltaic properties and display strikingly strong absorption in the 500–600 nm region, while the spectral response decreases quickly at longer wavelengths as well as in the blue region.2 Therefore, a combination of the two types of dye molecules will be an effective way to improve the overall light harvesting in DSSCs.
Results and discussion
The synthetic route to HD18 is sketched in Scheme 1. The detailed protocol is described in the Experimental section. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) characterizations of the as-synthesized porphyrin molecule are provided in Fig. S1 and S2,† which confirm the structure of HD18 in Scheme 1. In the use of porphyrin to sensitize a TiO2 nanoparticle film, it is generally observed that porphyrin molecules tend to aggregate on the surface, which usually lead to self-quenching and reduce the efficiency of electron injection into TiO2.23–25 Therefore, engineering of porphyrin sensitizers with enhanced stability and inhibition of aggregation is paramount. In this study, the push–pull zinc porphyrin HD18 based on the ortho-alkylated phenyl-substituted porphyrin core, in which the nonplanar (4-(bis(9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)amino)phenyl)ethynyl moiety serves as donor group,26 can not only suppress aggregate formation but also increase the molar extinction coefficient of the organic sensitizer. In addition, the introduction of ethynylbenzoic acid in HD18 as an acceptor group can facilitate charge injection.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic route for HD18. 
The electrochemical properties of HD18 were studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. 1). The measurement shows an oxidation potential of 0.62 V (vs. NHE), which corresponds to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy of the dye.27 This value is more positive than the redox couple I−/I3− (0.45 V vs. NHE), thus favorable kinetics for dye regeneration can be achieved. On the other hand, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) was calculated to be −1.12 V (vs. NHE), which is higher than the conduction band of TiO2 and thus enables efficient charge injection kinetics.

HD18 shows typical absorption peaks associated with Soret and Q bands, located at ∼455 nm and ∼665 nm (Fig. 2a),17,21 with absorption coefficients of 1.67 × 105 M−1 cm−1 and 0.47 × 105 M−1 cm−1, respectively. The absorption features of HD18 anchoring onto TiO2 film are similar to those in solution (Fig. 2b). Obviously, these two light absorption bands are complementary to the state-of-the-art N719 dye molecule, which has strong absorption in the range of 500–600 nm (Fig. 2b). When the two types of dye are co-adsorbed onto the TiO2 film, the light absorption shows an impressive enhancement when compared with each of the individually sensitized solar cells (Fig. 2b). Therefore, the combination of N719 dye molecules and a porphyrin-based sensitizer can offer a platform for strong panchromatic sunlight harvesting.

DSSCs were fabricated according to our reported method with modifications.20,28,29 The fabrication of a co-sensitized anode was performed by sequential soaking of the anode film in dye solutions. For comparison, DSSCs individually sensitized by HD18 (device 1) and N719 (device 2) were also prepared. Optimizations showed that TiO2 films with their anodes consisting of a 12 μm transparent layer and a 6 μm scattering TiO2 layer, immersed in porphyrin dye for 12 h, followed by adsorbing N719 for 3 h, give rise to the highest PCE (8.89% ± 0.06%) of the co-sensitized device (device 3, Fig. 3, the device parameters are tabulated in Table 1). At the same time, devices 1 and 2 show PCEs of 7.21% and 8.02%, with short-circuit photocurrent densities (Jsc) of 15.48 and 16.47 mA cm−2, respectively. It should be noted that, to make fair comparisons, the dye loading times for devices 1 and 2 are 16 h, and these are optimized durations for the corresponding dye molecules.

To elucidate the improved Jsc in the co-sensitized device, we performed incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) characterization. The IPCE is associated with the product of light harvesting efficiency (ηlh), charge injection efficiency (ηinj), and charge collection efficiency (ηcoll).2 From Fig. 4, the IPCE of device 3 is boosted in a broad spectrum and exhibits two humps from 400–500 nm and 600–700 nm when compared with the DSSC individually sensitized by N719. These two bands correspond to the strong absorption of HD18. On the other hand, compared with the DSSCs sensitized by HD18, the photocurrent generation in the 500–600 nm range is greatly enhanced. Therefore, the co-sensitized device can take advantage of both types of dye molecules. The significantly improved Jsc in device 3 (18.51 ± 0.08 mA cm−2) is thus mainly due to the improved light harvesting, which is consistent with the UV-visible spectra alternations where the co-sensitized film presents increased light absorption.
 Fig. 4  Incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of devices sensitized by HD18 (device 1), N719 (device 2) and HD18 + N719 (device 3). 
The open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the co-sensitized device 3 (0.711 ± 0.002) falls in between those of the devices sensitized solely with HD18 (0.693 V) and N719 (0.732 V); such a phenomenon is commonly seen in a co-sensitizing configuration. To gain insight into the co-sensitizing mechanism, we performed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) under dark conditions. As shown in Fig. 5a, the x-intercepts of the EIS curves indicate the resistance of the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass surface. The straight lines at high frequencies imply ion diffusion resistance through the 3D anode network. They are overlapped, indicating similar ion transport speed in the devices. Further, the Nyquist arcs appearing at the intermediate-frequency regime are associated with the recombination resistance (Rct) at the interface of TiO2/dye/electrolyte, i.e., the recombination kinetics between conduction-band electrons in TiO2 and I3− species from the electrolyte. The calculated resistance values (Rct) are listed in Table S1;† the larger the Rct, the slower the recombination kinetics. It is noted that device 2 presents the largest Rct (196.4 Ω, Table S2†). Slower recombination would lead to higher Voc. Therefore, device 2 shows high Voc. The lowest Voc of the HD18 sensitized device is associated with the smallest Rct (52.2 Ω). Furthermore, the calculated Rct of co-sensitized device 3 is 142.1 Ω, which is in between those of devices 1 and 2. This observation is consistent with Voc evolution as discussed above.
 Fig. 5  (a) Nyquist and (b) Bode phase plots of DSSCs based on individual HD18 and N719 electrode (devices 1 and 2) and HD18 + N719 co-sensitized electrodes (device 3). 
From the Bode phase plots of the devices (Fig. 5b), the characteristic back charge transfer frequency (f) can be obtained, which corresponds to the peak of the Bode phase plot. The electron lifetime (τn) in the TiO2 film can be calculated from eqn (1):30,31 (1)where f is the characteristic frequency, corresponding to the peak in the intermediate-frequency regime. The obtained τn values are also shown in Table S1.† It can be seen that the device sensitized by HD18 alone displays the shortest τn among all the devices. In the device with the co-adsorption of N719, the electron lifetime is prolonged to a value quite close to that of the device sensitized with N719 alone.
To further probe the recombination kinetics of the devices, open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) curves were recorded, which can continuously record the lifetime of Voc from a steady state to dark equilibrium.32Fig. 6a shows the OCVD profiles of devices 1 to 3. The profiles at the interval of 20 to 30 seconds were enlarged for clearer observation (Fig. 6b). The correlation between Voc decay and electron lifetime (τn) can be expressed by eqn (2): (2)where KB is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature, and e is the electron charge.8,32 Therefore, the electron lifetimes can be extracted from the initial slope of Voc decay curves. First, the decay curve of device 1 presents the steepest slope while that of device 2 displays the slowest one, which suggests the shortest electron lifespan is for the HD18-sensitized device and the longest one is for the N719-sensitized device. This variation matches well with the photovoltaic and EIS analyses of the devices made by the two dyes.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated for the first time panchromatic light harvesting by the co-sensitization of a porphyrin-based dye and N719 in dye-sensitized solar cells. Remarkable improvements of 23.3% and 10.8% are achieved in the co-sensitized devices when compared with the devices individually sensitized by HD18 and N719, respectively. Generally, porphyrin-based dyes possess a spectral response complementary to that of ruthenium-complex based dyes. This type of co-sensitization is anticipated to arouse broad interest in further boosting the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells by using these two important classes of molecules.

The solvent was then removed, and the residue was purified on a silica gel column eluted with CH2Cl2–hexane (1:1, v/v) to give the methyl ester-protected porphyrin dye. The crude product was further dissolved in 4 mL of THF and 1 mL of methanol, then 1 mL of 1 M NaOH aqueous solution was added by syringe. The solution was refluxed under argon for 2 h and cooled to room temperature. The pH value was adjusted to around 4 by adding 1 M HCl. The mixture was extracted with CHCl3 twice, and the organic layer collected was dried with anhydrous Na2SO4.

Device fabrication
A layer of ∼6 μm TiO2 paste (particle size ∼20 nm) was doctor-bladed onto FTO conducting glass and then dried for 6 min at 150 °C. This procedure was repeated to prepare a thickness of ∼12 μm, and the resulting surface was finally coated by a scattering layer (∼6 μm) of TiO2 paste (particle size ∼200 nm). The final thickness of the electrodes is ∼18 μm. These TiO2 electrodes were gradually heated under an air flow at 275 °C for 5 min, 325 °C for 5 min, 375 °C for 5 min, and 470 °C for 30 min to remove polymers. Then, these sintered films were soaked with 0.02 M TiF4 aqueous solution for 60 min at 70 °C, washed with deionized water, and further annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. For dye loading, the electrodes were first immersed into a 0.2 mM HD18 dye bath (acetonitrile–tert-butyl alcohol (1:1, v/v) solution, with 10 mM chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA)) for 12 h. Afterwards, the electrodes were transferred into a 0.5 mM N719 dye bath in acetonitrile–tert-butyl alcohol (1:1, v/v) solution for 3 h. The electrodes were then rinsed with ethanol to remove the non-adsorbed dyes and dried in air. In addition, the dye soaking times for the anodes of device 1 and 2 are 16 h, which are the standard time spans. Finally, the dye soaked films were stacked with a Pt-based counter electrode and filled with iodine/iodide-based electrolyte. The effective areas of all the devices were 0.24 cm2.
Material and device characterizations
NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Ultrashield 400 Plus NMR spectrometer. High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was performed on a Bruker Autoflex MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained using a Hitachi U-3501 UV-visible/NIR spectrophotometer. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the assembled cells were measured by a semiconductor characterization system (Keithley 236) at room temperature in air under the spectral output from a solar simulator (Newport) using an AM 1.5 G filter with a light power of 100 mW cm−2. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed by applying a bias of 700 mV under dark conditions over a frequency range of 0.1–105 Hz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV, and the parameters were calculated from Z-View software (v2.1b, Scribner AssociatNe, Inc.). For the open-circuit voltage decay measurements, the cell was first illuminated for 20 s to a steady voltage, then the illumination was turned off for 40 s and the photovoltage decay curve was recorded; this process was repeated for three periods to further confirm the stability of the cell. The above two measurements were performed on a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation. The photocurrent conversion efficiency spectra of DSSCs were recorded using a Solar Cell QE/IPCE measurement system (Zolix Solar Cell Scan 100) in DC mode.
