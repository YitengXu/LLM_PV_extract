Introduction
Metal oxide semiconductor (MOS, i.e., TiO2, ZnO and WO3) electrodes, with the characteristic of a photoelectric response, hold great promise for new energy and photoelectronic device applications, such as water photoelectrocatalysis, light emission, dye- and quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells, etc.1–10 Generally, for photoelectronic device application, a good conductivity (and/or photo-induced conductivity) and visible light induced photoelectric response of these MOS photoelectrodes will enhance their performance and usable capacity greatly.11,12 Much progress has been achieved in the development of MOS based photoelectrodes for high performance photoelectronic devices, for example, using an electron acceptor to transfer electrons quickly from the conduction band (CB) of the MOS to an external circuit, reducing electron recombination and enhancing the overall power conversion efficiency (PCE).13 Meanwhile, the interfacial electron transfer in nanosized materials also varies with the size and the morphology of the materials and then, various nanostructured semiconductors have been designed with a short charge diffusion length, high crystallinity and more charge separation sites, but fewer defects have been fabricated.14–17 Moreover, the formation of a semiconductor hetero-junction is also extensively applied to improve the charge separation and transformation.18,19 However, many MOS photoelectrodes (i.e., TiO2 and WO3) still suffer from poor conductivity and low PCE, which are greatly limited by the low electron diffusion coefficient and the high interfacial electron–hole recombination.20
Polyoxometalate (POM), as a nanosized multi-functional species, should be an ideal candidate for photovoltaic application. Our previous studies have shown that POM, in MOS based solar photovoltaic systems, can act as the electron acceptor or the electron donor to increase the PCE.21–27 Motivated by the strong photoelectric activities of POM, we further expect combining a suitable POM species with MOSs as a way to construct MOS composite photoelectrodes with light enhanced conductivity for high performance photoelectronic devices. Achim Müller, a famous scientist, has made outstanding contributions in the high-nuclear cluster field.28 In the POM family, keplerate-type species, (NH4)42[MoVI72MoV60O372(CH3COO)30(H2O)72] ({Mo132}) clusters, capture our attention as the photo-induced electron acceptor or electron donor to enhance the conductivity of MOS electrodes owing to its strong absorption in visible light, high stability and unique photoelectric properties. Here, we show a general and efficient POM assistance strategy for the design and fabrication of MOS composite photoelectrodes with light enhanced conductivity. Four kinds of MOS film electrodes were fabricated by combining {Mo132} with MOSs, denoted as {Mo132}/MOS (TiO2, ZnO, WO3, and SnO2). In these composite photoelectrodes, {Mo132} clusters act as a photo-induced electron acceptor/donor to accelerate electron transfer, improve the electron lifetime and retard the recombination, and then lead to the photo-enhanced conductivity. Further, {Mo132}/TiO2 composite photoelectrodes were introduced into the DSSCs as the photoanode. The 5% {Mo132}/TiO2 photoanode exhibits a PCE of 7.94%, increased by 31% compared with that of the TiO2-based cell (PCE, 6.06%).
Results and discussion
Properties of {Mo132}
{Mo132}, a nanoball reported by Achim Müller in 1998, has a fascinating and special structure with more than 500 atoms and the highest Euclidean symmetry.28–30 The anion of {Mo132} is a spherical icosahedral cluster (a nanoball), which is composed of 12 {Mo11} fragments with a central bipyramidal pentagonal {MoO7} unit to form a cage structure (see Fig. S1†). About {Mo132}, most previous reports mainly focused on its structure and basic catalytic properties.30 Here, some basic electrochemical and photoelectric properties of {Mo132} were further investigated in our experiments. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image (Fig. 1a) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) profile (upper inset in Fig. 1a) of the prepared {Mo132} display that {Mo132} nanoballs can be self-assembled to be the aggregates with the size ranging between 1 and 2.5 μm. Energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) further demonstrates the existence of Mo, C and O in the {Mo132} aggregates (down inset in Fig. 1a). The UV-vis absorption spectrum of {Mo132} exhibits a broad optical absorption band nearly covering the whole UV and visible regions (Fig. 1b), which is beneficial for solar energy harvesting. The UV light absorption is attributed to the charge transfer from oxygen to metal and the visible absorption is due to MoV d–d transitions and MoV–MoVI intervalence charge transfer transition in the {Mo132} framework.31 The electron energy levels of {Mo132} were also studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the solid diffuse reflection method, as well as the ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) techniques. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of POM is formally a combination of d orbits centering on the metal atoms, which could be estimated from the first reduction applied potential of the CV.32 It can be confirmed from Fig. 1c that the LUMO level of {Mo132} corresponds to −0.52 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which is equal to −0.33 V vs. NHE and −4.17 eV vs. vacuum. The band gap energy (Eg) of {Mo132} was acquired from the diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectrum. Fig. 1d reveals the plot of K–M function F against energy E of {Mo132}. The Eg of {Mo132} was estimated to be 1.61 eV by measuring the x-axis intercept of an extrapolated line from the linear regime of the curve.33 The UPS measurement of {Mo132} was carried out to gain more insight into the energy levels. As shown in Fig. 1e, the work function (WF) of the {Mo132} is calculated to be about 2.84 eV by subtracting the width of the secondary electron cutoff (18.38 eV) from the excitation energy (21.22 eV). The ionization energy (IE, the onset of the band of the occupied orbital) of {Mo132} is about 2.96 eV, and then the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of {Mo132} with respect to the vacuum level can be calculated from −(WF + IE), which is −5.80 eV.4,34,35 On the basis of the UPS and UV-vis spectrum results, the LUMO of {Mo132} can be estimated to be −4.19 eV, which is in good agreement with the result gained from the CV test (−4.17 eV vs. vacuum). Fig. 1f shows the energy levels of {Mo132}, the reported theoretical calculation data of {Mo132},36 and the band structure of common MOSs. It suggests that the energy levels (HOMO/LUMO) of {Mo132} are in an intermediate position of the band structure (VB/CB) of common MOSs, which satisfy the necessary condition for {Mo132} improving the conductivity of {Mo132}/MOS composite electrodes by the electron acceptance or donation. In addition, the TG curve and IR spectra of {Mo132} (Fig. S2†) demonstrate that the skeleton structures of {Mo132} remain stable below 210 °C, indicating a good stability of the {Mo132}/MOS composite during the fabrication.

{Mo132}/TiO2 composite photoelectrodes
In the first set of experiments, we studied the photo-electronic chemical properties of {Mo132}/MOS composite photoelectrodes. Briefly, the TiO2 paste prepared by mixing {Mo132} and the calcined TiO2 with a mass percentage of 5% (5% {Mo132}; 95% TiO2) was fabricated to be the composite photoelectrode (5% {Mo132}/TiO2 photoelectrode), and the pure TiO2 for comparison.37 The SEM image (Fig. 2a) of the 5% {Mo132}/TiO2 photoelectrode indicates that it consists of spherical and granular particles with the size in the range from 20 to 100 nm. Furthermore, the EDS mapping (Fig. 2b) demonstrates the existence of Ti, Mo, C and O, which confirms that {Mo132} and TiO2 are uniformly distributed in the composite photoelectrodes. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out to monitor the TiO2 phase changes in the 5% {Mo132}/TiO2 composite photoelectrodes. The characteristic peaks of TiO2 can be discovered from the XRD patterns of calcined TiO2 and 5% {Mo132}/TiO2 (Fig. 2c), which are in agreement with those of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS, 21-1272), indicating that the crystal shape of TiO2 was not changed after the modification with {Mo132}. The diffraction peaks of {Mo132} are not effectively detected from the XRD patterns of 5% {Mo132}/TiO2 due to the lower content of {Mo132} or its amorphous state.38 The X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) of TiO2, {Mo132} and the 5% {Mo132}/TiO2 composite was used to further analyze the surface composition and chemical environment of Ti and Mo atoms. As shown in Fig. S3† and 2d, the XPS spectra of 5% {Mo132}/TiO2 clearly reveal the presence of O (1s), Ti (2p), C (1s) and Mo (3d). For pure TiO2, the energy regions of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 are located at 457.8 and 463.4 eV, while both Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 energy regions shift towards the lower binding energy and are located at 457.4 and 463.2 eV for the 5% {Mo132}/TiO2 composite.39,40Fig. 2e clearly illustrates that the characteristic Mo 3d doublet is composed of the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 levels. In the lower group curves of the XPS of {Mo132}, the peaks located at 231.9 eV and 235.1 eV are assigned to MoVI, while the peaks at 234.1 eV and 231.1 eV are attributed to MoV.41,42 Furthermore, the XPS peaks of Mo in 5% {Mo132}/TiO2 also shift towards a lower binding energy compared with those of the pure {Mo132}. All these XPS results indicate that the {Mo132} has indeed been combined with TiO2 in the 5% {Mo132}/TiO2 composite, but not the physical mixture of {Mo132} and TiO2. Fig. 2f represents the powder UV-vis absorption spectra of TiO2, 5% {Mo132}/TiO2 and pure {Mo132}. Pure TiO2 only absorbs UV light (λ < 387 nm) without any absorption in the visible and infrared regions, while strong UV and visible absorption could be observed for the 5% {Mo132}/TiO2 composite.

The photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are the valuable measurements to study the conductivity of the surface-modified electrodes, in particular regarding the electron-transfer characteristics.43 The photocurrent transient experiments have been carried out under simulated solar illumination for the 5% {Mo132}/TiO2 and the TiO2 film electrodes to investigate the conductivity of the electrodes with the introduction of {Mo132}. Fig. 3a presents the photocurrent changes of the film electrodes when the irradiation is switched on and off. The photocurrent density of pure TiO2 is approximately 0.015 mA cm−2, and this weak photocurrent response may be due to its fast electron–hole recombination and weak absorption in the visible area. Strikingly, the photocurrent response intensity of the 5% {Mo132}/TiO2 (about 0.059 mA cm−2) is four times higher than that of pure TiO2. Furthermore, the photocurrent at different irradiance is shown in Fig. 3b; the 5% {Mo132}/TiO2 film electrode shows a higher photocurrent response for different light intensities compared to the pure TiO2, which also testifies that the conductivity of TiO2 is virtually enhanced by the incorporation of {Mo132}. The reason may be that {Mo132} can compensate for the weak absorption of TiO2 in the visible region.

The investigations of EIS presented in the form of typical Nyquist plots are to understand the difference in the electronic properties of 5% {Mo132}/TiO2 and TiO2 film electrodes (Fig. 3c). The semicircle diameter at high frequency corresponds to the charge-transfer resistance (Rct), and a straight line at low frequency is attributed to the diffusion process, which represents the so-called Warburg impedance.44 The analog circuit diagram of the equivalent circuit used to fit the impedance measurement is illustrated in Fig. S4.† The diameter for the arc radius of the 5% {Mo132}/TiO2 electrode is smaller than that of the TiO2 electrode, which indicates that the conductivity is enhanced by the modification of TiO2 with {Mo132}. {Mo132} may enhance the injection and transport of electrons, and then retard the electron recombination in the TiO2 film electrode. The surface photovoltage spectrum (SPS) and the photoluminescence (PL) were also further utilized to survey the charge transfer process at the interface of TiO2 and {Mo132} in the electrode. The SPS of pure TiO2 suggests a peak around 360 nm (Fig. 3d), which may be ascribed to the charge separation upon only UV light excitation. The 5% {Mo132}/TiO2 composite reveals higher photovoltage in the visible region than pure TiO2 (Fig. 3d), which demonstrates that the modification of {Mo132} could broaden the optical response range of TiO2, while the SPS response of 5% {Mo132}/TiO2 (9.72 mV) displays lower photovoltage in the UV region than that of pure TiO2 (20.82 mV), which may be attributed to the photogenerated charge transfer between {Mo132} and TiO2 particles. The electrons accepted by the {Mo132} will recombine with the holes of TiO2, leading to a lower photovoltage and enhancing the conductivity of the TiO2.45 In addition, the change of PL intensities can reveal the photogenerated charge-carrier recombination rate in semiconductors.27 The PL of pure TiO2 appears as a fluorescence emission band at 500 nm upon the excitation at 390 nm (Fig. 3e), which is efficiently quenched (upon the same excitation wavelength) with the introduction of {Mo132} into TiO2 demonstrating that the photo-induced electrons may transfer from TiO2 to {Mo132} clusters. It can be concluded that the charge recombination is suppressed by the incorporated {Mo132}. The LUMO of {Mo132} is lower than the CB of TiO2, so {Mo132} can be used as the electron acceptor to accept the electrons from TiO2, which is a favorable exothermic process (Fig. 3f). The photoelectrons in the excited state can be extracted and transferred to {Mo132}. So {Mo132} may increase the mobility of electrons in the TiO2 and enhance the conductivity of the electrode.
{Mo132}/MOS (ZnO, WO3, and SnO2) photoelectrodes
In the {Mo132}/TiO2 system, we show that {Mo132} acts as the photo-induced electron acceptor to accelerate electron transfer and then improve its conductivity efficiently. Here the question is whether {Mo132} is a general functional species for the high performance {Mo132}/MOS composite photoelectrodes or not. Similar to TiO2, ZnO is also a wide band gap (about 3.20 eV) MOS. Similar experiments of {Mo132} modified ZnO film electrodes (Fig. S5 and S6†) with a weight ratio of 5% were also carried out under simulated solar illumination. In Fig. S6a and S6b,† a similar morphology of the ZnO film and 5% {Mo132}/ZnO suggests that the {Mo132} did not affect the morphology of ZnO. The photocurrent response intensity of the 5% {Mo132}/ZnO changes from 0.03 mA cm−2 to 0.08 mA cm−2 (Fig. S6c†). Meanwhile, in Fig. S6d,† the investigation of EIS also proves that {Mo132} may act as the electron acceptor to inhibit the recombination of electron–hole pairs, thus improving the conductivity of the 5% {Mo132}/ZnO film electrode. WO3 is a MOS material (band gap about 2.70 eV) with the CB edge (−5.24 eV vs. vacuum) lower than the LUMO of {Mo132}.46 The XRD patterns of WO3 powder (Fig. S7†) indicate that it is the monoclinic phase.9 In the following experiments, the {Mo132}/WO3 composite photoelectrode was fabricated by combining {Mo132} and WO3 nanocrystals with a weight ratio of 5%. The SEM images of WO3 and 5% {Mo132}/WO3 film electrodes illustrate the morphology of the film surface. As shown in Fig. S8a,† the fairly uniform-sized WO3 nanocrystals are distributed well on the surface. Also, the similar morphology of the 5% {Mo132}/WO3 film is shown in Fig. S8b,† suggesting that the {Mo132} did not influence the morphology of WO3. The photocurrent response and EIS experiments of 5% {Mo132}/WO3 and pure WO3 film electrodes have been carried out to study the conductivity of the {Mo132}-modified WO3 film electrodes. It can be observed that the photocurrent density (approximately 0.16 mA cm−2) of the 5% {Mo132}/WO3 film electrode increases by about 0.02 mA cm−2 compared to that of pure WO3 (0.14 mA cm−2) (Fig. 4a). In addition, the EIS investigations (Fig. 4b) indicate that the semicircle diameter at high frequency of the 5% {Mo132}/WO3 film electrode is smaller than that of the WO3 electrode, which reveals that the charge-transfer resistance on the electrode surface is decreased with the introduction of {Mo132}. The PL experiment was also carried out to understand the efficiency of charge trapping and transfer in the semiconductor. The PL signal intensity at 480 nm for the 5% {Mo132}/WO3 is much lower than that of pure WO3 (Fig. 4c). It also implies that the composite of {Mo132}/WO3 has a lower recombination rate of electrons and holes, which is mainly attributed to the excited electron transfer from {Mo132} to WO3. The LUMO potential of {Mo132} is higher than the CB edge of WO3 (−5.24 eV vs. vacuum), so the excited electrons on {Mo132} can be directly injected into the CB of WO3 under the simulated solar irradiation, and the electrons subsequently transfer to the FTO substrate (Fig. 4d). These results demonstrate that {Mo132} has the extensive applicability to be used as the electron donor. Similarly, the CB of the SnO2 (−4.50 eV vs. vacuum) is also lower than the LUMO of {Mo132}. The photocurrent response and EIS experiments of 5% {Mo132}/SnO2 and pure SnO2 film electrodes have also been carried out. The XRD patterns of SnO2 in Fig. S9† correspond well to those of the tetragonal SnO2 (JCPDS, 41-1445).47 The SEM image of SnO2 shows the flower structure (Fig. S10a†). Additionally, the SEM image of 5% {Mo132}/SnO2 reveals that the morphology is not changed after the modification of {Mo132} (Fig. S10b†). In Fig. S10c,† the photocurrent response of the 5% {Mo132}/SnO2 film electrode is increased by about 0.01 mA cm−2 compared to that of pure SnO2. The results of the EIS (Fig. S10d†) can also manifest that the {Mo132} has the universality for other MOS film electrodes both as the electron acceptor and donor. As discussed above, {Mo132} can not only be used as the electron acceptor, but also can be used as the electron donor to modulate the conductivity of electrodes under light. Here we further summarize the function and propose the mechanism of {Mo132} in {Mo132}/MOS (Fig. 5). Simply, we divide the common MOS into two parts: MOS (I), the CB edge is higher than the LUMO of {Mo132}; MOS (II), the CB edge is lower than the LUMO of {Mo132}. For the {Mo132}/MOS (I) system, as shown in Fig. 5a, the electrons in the MOS (I) CB edge could be extracted and transferred to {Mo132}, by which {Mo132} can increase the mobility of electrons in the MOS (I) and enhance the conductivity of the MOS based photoelectrode. At the same time, in the interfacial region, electron recombination may be overcome by introducing this kind of powerful electron acceptor {Mo132}. On the other hand, for the {Mo132}/MOS (II) system (see Fig. 5b), {Mo132} is used as the electron donor and the photoelectrons can be injected into the CB of MOS (II) efficiently. At last, the photoresponse properties and narrow band gap nature of {Mo132} are also helpful for the present light enhanced conductivity of the {Mo132}/MOS (I and II) system.

In (a), MOS (I) represents a class of metal oxides, whose CB is higher than the LUMO of {Mo132}. {Mo132} clusters act as the electron acceptor. In (b), MOS (II), the CB edge is lower than the LUMO of {Mo132}. {Mo132} clusters can be used as the electron donor. 
{Mo132}/TiO2 photoelectrode based DSSCs
We further demonstrated the application of the 5% {Mo132}/TiO2 photoanode in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Fig. 6a presents the scheme of the DSSC based on 5% {Mo132}/TiO2, which consists of a film of the dye (N719)-sensitized {Mo132}/TiO2 photoelectrode, a Pt counter electrode and the electrolyte containing the redox pairs (I−/I3−). Fig. 6b presents the UV-vis absorption spectra of {Mo132} and N719. Notably, {Mo132} has a good absorption in the visible area at 450 nm, which is expected to make up for the visible absorption of dye N719. The performance of the {Mo132}/TiO2 DSSCs was investigated under simulated AM 1.5 illumination (at 100 mW cm−2) and in the dark, respectively. The power conversion efficiency (η) of the {Mo132}/TiO2 DSSC has a pronounced enhancement compared to that of the pure TiO2 DSSC. The {Mo132}/TiO2 DSSC exhibits a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 16.78 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 711 mV and a fill factor (FF) of 0.666, resulting in a η of 7.94% (see Table 1). It indicates an overall PCE improvement up to 31% compared with that of the TiO2-based cell (6.06%). The increase of Jsc may be due to more efficient electron injection, smoother transfer and highly efficient collection. The improvement of Voc may be ascribed to the reduced charge recombination. Further, 5% {Mo132}/TiO2 can also decrease the onset of dark current to different extents (Fig. 6c), which may be attributed to the contribution of {Mo132} preventing the electrons from flowing back to the electrolyte or dyes from the {Mo132}/TiO2 photoelectrode. Fig. 6d depicts the EIS measurements with the 5% {Mo132}/TiO2 photoanode and the pure TiO2. The semicircle at high frequency corresponds to R1, which represents the charge transfer resistance at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface. The second semicircle (R2) reflects the electron transport resistance at the photoelectrode/dye/electrolyte interface related to the charge transport/recombination.48 Here, R1 is similar since all the cells have the same Pt counter electrode and electrolyte. However, the R2 of the 5% {Mo132}/TiO2 photoanode changes from 4.86 Ω (pure TiO2) to 6.26 Ω, which indicates that {Mo132} can retard the charge recombination and result in a smoother and efficient electron transmission in the {Mo132}/TiO2 photoanode. The Bode phase plots are shown in Fig. 6e, the characteristic frequency peak (fmax) of the 5% {Mo132}/TiO2 photoanode at the top of the intermediate frequency arc is 72.20 Hz and the fmax of TiO2 is 31.10 Hz, so the calculated electron lifetime (about 5.12 ms) of the DSSC based on 5% {Mo132}/TiO2 is longer than that of TiO2 (about 2.21 ms) based on the fmax values,49 which coincides with the dark current measurements, demonstrating an improvement in the retardation of carrier recombination. Meanwhile, the electron recombination can be further evaluated by the open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD), which monitors the decay of Voc after turning off the illumination in a setting time.50 As shown in Fig. 6f, it is evident that the DSSC based on the 5% {Mo132}/TiO2 photoanode exhibits a slower photovoltage decay rate than that based on the pure TiO2 photoanode, which indicates that the electron recombination kinetics have been retarded effectively. Further, from the inset of Fig. 6f, we can also conclude that the 5% {Mo132}/TiO2 photoanode has a longer electron lifetime than the pure TiO2 photoanode, and will lead to the higher charge collection rate of photogenerated electrons and an improvement in the cell efficiency.

In the next study, a series of {Mo132}/TiO2 photoanode-based DSSCs were fabricated and their performance is shown in Fig. S11 and S12.† The average performance characteristics obtained from the multiple cells are summarized in Table S1,† and the corresponding parameters obtained from the EIS are listed in Table S2.† The PCE values of the DSSCs have a pronounced enhancement with the increase of the content of {Mo132} from 1%, 3% to 5%, compared to the performance of pure TiO2, and the best performance of DSSCs is the percentage of {Mo132} up to 5%. However, after increasing the content of {Mo132} up to 7%, the R2 of the 7% {Mo132}/TiO2 photoanode reduces to 5.04 Ω (Fig. S12a and Table S2†), and the performance of DSSCs would decline and is close to that of pure TiO2. It may be attributed to the aggregation of the {Mo132} during the paste making process, and then the electrons massively injected into the electrolyte and no longer collected at the anode.51
Experimental
Chemicals and reagents
All chemicals were commercially purchased and used without further purification. {Mo132} was prepared according to the literature method.28
Electrode preparation
First, TiO2 powder was sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. Then the TiO2 paste was prepared according to the literature by mixing {Mo132} and the calcined TiO2 with a series mass percentage of 0%, 1%, 3%, 5%, and 7% to fabricate the film electrodes.52 The FTO glass plates were pretreated by immersing them into the 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min, and washed with water and absolute ethanol. The electrodes were prepared by coating one layer of paste on the FTO glass plates by screen-printing followed by drying for 5 min at 120 °C. Four-layered paste was coated on every FTO glass. Then, the film electrodes were calcined at 210 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, the resulting sintered film electrodes were post-treated in 40 mM TiCl4 solution for 30 min at 70 °C and calcined in air at 210 °C for 30 min again. In the meantime, {Mo132} modified ZnO, WO3, and SnO2 electrodes in a ratio of 5% were prepared in the same way.
Solar cell fabrication
The obtained TiO2 film electrodes were immersed in the 0.2 mM N719 absolute ethanol solution for 24 h. The excess unanchored dyes were rinsed off with absolute ethanol and dried with N2. Platinum was used as the counter electrode. A drop of electrolyte solution composed of 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in 3-methoxypropionitrile was introduced between the electrodes by using an injector.
Characterization methods
The IR spectrum was recorded in the range of 400–4000 cm−1 region on an Alpha Centaurt FT/IR spectrophotometer with KBr pellets. TG analysis was performed on a PerkinElmer TGA7 instrument at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from 25 to 600 °C. X-ray powder diffraction data were collected on a Bruker AXS D8 Advance diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) in the 2θ range of 3–90° with a step size of 0.02°. The diffuse reflectance spectra were collected on a SHIMADZU UV-Vis Spectrophotometer UV-2600 in reflectance mode, which were measured from 200 to 800 nm using barium sulfate (BaSO4) as a standard with 100% reflectance. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were performed using the 1He (21.22 eV) excitation. The morphology of the samples was characterized by SEM (FESEM; XL30, FEG, FEI Company) and TEM (HitachiH-7650). Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was performed using a FEI Quanta 200F microscope. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed with a hemispherical analyzer Leybold EA 11. The fluorescence spectra were recorded on a FL900/FS920 steady-state fluorescence spectrometer.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
Cyclic voltammetry curves were recorded on a CHI601D Electrochemical Workstation (Shanghai CH Instrument Corp., China), using the composite film assembled FTO glass electrodes as the working electrode and a Pt wire as the counter electrode and the reference was a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode. 0.10 M Na2SO4/H2SO4 solution with pH = 4.00 was used as the supporting electrolyte on the premise of stability of {Mo132}. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the electrodes were measured with an impedance analyzer (Compactstat, IVIUM Tech.) at an open-circuit potential under the condition of simulated solar illumination in 0.10 M KCl solution containing equimolar [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− at an ac frequency from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz. All electrodes were illuminated from the front side using a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with an AM 1.5 G filter (Model 81094, Newport) to simulate the solar spectrum. The photocurrent transient experiments were carried out at a constant bias of 0 V under simulated solar illumination. The illumination area of the working electrode was set constant at 0.25 cm2. The surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS) measurement was carried out on a lab-made instrument, which constitutes a source of monochromatic light, a lock-in amplifier (SR830-DSP) with a light chopper (SR540) and a photovoltaic cell. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of the DSSCs were conducted on an electrochemical workstation, applying a DC bias at open circuit voltage and an AC voltage with the amplitude of 10 mV under dark conditions. Impedance parameters were determined by fitting the impedance spectra using Z-view software. Open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) of the DSSCs was measured under AM 1.5 simulated solar illumination at 100 mW cm−2.
Conclusions
We report a general and efficient polyoxometalate assistance strategy for the design and fabrication of POM/MOS composite photoelectrodes with light-enhanced conductivity. Four {Mo132}/MOS composite photoelectrodes ({Mo132}/TiO2, ZnO, WO3, and SnO2) were fabricated and investigated to evaluate the light-enhanced conductivity of these composite photoelectrodes. In {Mo132}/MOS composite photoelectrodes, {Mo132} acts as a photo-induced electron acceptor/donor to accelerate the electron transfer and then improve their conductivity efficiently. Also, the photoresponse properties and narrow band gap nature of {Mo132} are also helpful for this light-enhanced conductivity process. We further demonstrated that the 5% {Mo132}/TiO2 photoelectrode can be applied in DSSCs as the photoanode. In this system, {Mo132} has a good absorption in the visible area at 450 nm, which makes up for the visible absorption of N719. The 5% {Mo132}/TiO2 modified photoanode exhibits the largest electron lifetime (5.12 ms), longer than that of pure TiO2 (2.21 ms) and a high efficiency up to 7.94%, enhanced by 31% compared with that of pure TiO2 (6.06%). This work may also provide a new way for obtaining high performance photoelectrodes for many applications, including solar cells, water splitting devices, photocatalysis and sensors.
