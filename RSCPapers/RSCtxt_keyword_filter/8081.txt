E-mail: yara_yingling@ncsu.eduReceived 11th July 2013, Accepted 28th August 2013First published on 30th August 2013AbstractPolymer film morphology is known to correlate with the efficient charge transport and device efficiency of the bulk heterojunction solar cell. Further improvements of the performance of organic solar cells require a better understanding of the mechanisms of diffusion and molecular rearrangement. In this paper, we used atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to provide insights into the factors affecting diffusion of [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and fullerene (C60) into poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). We examined the diffusion and interactions of PCBMs in amorphous and around crystalline P3HTs at different temperatures. Simulations showed that fullerene particles tend to aggregate in amorphous P3HTs and on (100) surfaces. However, the diffusion of fullerenes on the (010) surface was mainly attributed to the preferential binding between fullerene cages and aromatic P3HT backbone which led to their directional diffusion on the thiophene backbone. The presence of the functional group in PCBM can be attributed to an increase in the diffusion coefficient by a factor of 1.5 to 2 as compared to C60. Interestingly low regioregularity of P3HTs reduced the diffusion and aggregation of PCBMs.IntroductionOrganic photovoltaic devices offer a promise of creating lightweight, low-cost, flexible solar cells with processing advantages and simple fabrication techniques. However, they have many unresolved problems such as low-power conversion efficiency and poor operational stability. Most improvements have been made in bulk heterojunction organic solar cells where nanoscale phase separation of donor (light-absorbing polymer) and acceptor (fullerene derivatives) components leads to a charge-separating heterojunction throughout the bulk of the thin film. The most widely used bulk heterojunction solar cell is composed of poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) with a power conversion efficiency of more than 5%.1–4 It is widely accepted that polymer film morphology is the key that determines photovoltaic properties and that improvement in the solar cell efficiency requires a fundamental understanding of the miscibility and diffusivity of donor and acceptor components.5–7Understanding and manipulation of polymer thin film morphology have been a focus of photovoltaic polymer research8 as it was proposed that the detailed molecular ordering of polymers and fullerenes may determine the performance of solar cells.9 The ideal morphology should consist of lateral and vertical networks of donor and acceptor phases with sizes on the order of 10 nm due to short exciton diffusion length.10 Molecular mixing between polymers and fullerenes was suggested to be counterproductive as isolated molecules can become charge recombination centers within the percolation pathways.11Many previous studies have discussed the existence of interdiffusion and miscibility between PCBM and P3HT domains.12–16 It was shown that while no intercalation occurs in P3HT crystals, amorphous P3HT blends contain significant concentrations of PCBMs, which has led to the discussion on existence of pure phases.10 Moreover, even in the absence of thermal annealing sequential solution processing of P3HT and PCBM produces an intermixed heterojunction.17 It was suggested that PCBM mixing into the P3HT underlayer is driven by swelling of P3HT in the solvent without destroying ordered domains of P3HT. Other results also confirm that mixing of PCBM with P3HT occurs only within P3HT amorphous regions and without disrupting ordered regions of P3HT.10,14 Additionally, it was proposed that due to fast diffusion of PCBM into P3HT the morphology of the polymer thin film will continue to change even under mild heating which further complicates the characterization of the morphology.14 Thus, a fundamental understanding of the diffusivity of PCBM and P3HT in the film is required in order to better understand and characterize the resultant film morphology.Computer simulations can provide detailed information on the interfacial dynamics, phase separation, and chemical and physical interactions between different molecules and at the interfaces. Various computational chemistry methods have been applied to the study of just polythiophenes.18–23 The density functional theory was used to investigate the interfacial charge transfer mechanisms of the P3HT–fullerene heterojunctions.24 Electronic structure calculations of disordered P3HTs were performed on structures determined by classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.25 MD simulations were also used to investigate the role of molecular-level structural changes in the difference in hole mobility of P3HT and PBTTT polymers.26 The effect of annealing time on the morphology of phase separation inside the active layers of polymer solar cells was investigated via Monte Carlo simulations.27 Coarse-grained simulations of a P3HT–C60 mixture demonstrated the capability to capture phase separation at length and time scales relevant to organic photovoltaic devices.28,29 However, no detailed investigation on parameters governing the diffusion of PCBM in P3HT has been conducted.In this paper, we use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to provide insights into the factors affecting diffusion of PCBM into P3HT. We investigate the diffusion and interactions of PCBMs in amorphous and around crystalline P3HTs at different temperatures. Different temperatures were used since thermal annealing enhances molecular mobility and enables PCBM molecules to diffuse through the film faster and form aggregates which lead to improvements in efficiency.30–32 We also compared diffusion and interactions of PCBMs with P3HTs to those of C60 with P3HT. Even though C60 is much cheaper to produce than PCBM, PCBMs shows better performance than C60 in organic solar cell blends. A comparative study between P3HT:C60 and P3HT:PCBM materials indicated that the crystallization of P3HT is severely suppressed by C60 as compared to PCBM.33 We also investigate the diffusion of PCBMs in regioregular (RR) and regiorandom (RRa) P3HTs, since the presence of RRa-P3HT can increase miscibility between P3HT and PCBM.13,34 Overall, we tried to explore the nature of intermolecular interactions between the P3HTs and PCBMs to reveal the nature of interfacial surface dynamics and molecular orientations that play an essential role during the morphology formation.MethodsThe MD simulations were performed using AMBER software35 and a general Amber force field (GAFF)36 which is parameterized for organic molecules and was previously tested for conjugated polymers like thiophene chains.37 GAFF defines bonds, angles, torsional terms, and nonbonded electrostatic interactions. The molecular electrostatic potential for thiophene chains and fullerene molecules was calculated using the AM1-BCC charge model that emulates the Hartree–Fock level of theory with a 6-31G* basis set (HF/6-31G*). Each monomer of the polymer chain was assumed to have an identical charge distribution, and a restrained electrostatic potential fit was performed on a monomeric unit. The long polymer chain was then built by repeating the monomer. To test the potentials and partial charge we simulated the behaviour of several polymer chains in a vacuum and in an explicit solvent and observed that the chain's rigidity and π–π stacking interactions between the chains were maintained. This confirmed the validity of the potential used in our simulations.Starting geometryBulk sample. To study the behaviour of PCBM molecules in the bulk 4 PCBMs were initially placed between 20-mer P3HT chains that were layered on top of each other. A small amount of a chloroform solvent was added to produce 44 wt% of the polymer blend. These models were based on observations from previous studies.24,38 Periodic boundary conditions were imposed to mimic an infinite polymer chain. The size of the simulation box was 86 Å × 45 Å × 40 Å. We used five models with different orientations of the PCBM functional group, i.e. [6,6]-phenyl butyric acid methyl ester, with respect to the P3HT chains (Fig. S1a–e†). For example, “dddd” denotes the configuration of 4 PCBM molecules with their functionalized group pointed down towards the P3HT chain and “rrrr” denotes the PCBM functionalized group lying parallel to the P3HT chains with the functional groups pointing right.Amorphous sample. Two amorphous polymer matrix samples were built: one with 16 5-mer regioregular P3HT chains and 4 PCBMs (0.37 wt% P3HT:PCBM ratio) and another with 34 5-mer P3HT chains and 20 PCBM molecules (0.15 wt% P3HT:PCBM ratio). The systems have 31 wt% and 40 wt% of the polymer blend with respect to chloroform.Surface samples. Experimental studies have identified two different chain orientations of the nanocrystalline regioregular P3HT domains with respect to the substrates.39 Thus, two samples of the P3HT surface were built to represent P3HT [100] and [010] surfaces. All surface simulations were performed in a vacuum with periodic boundary conditions. The coordinates of the 20-mer P3HT chains were based on the crystal structure40 with lattice constants of a = 16.1 Å, b = 3.8 Å, and c = 3.8 Å to represent the edge-on and face-on orientations of the P3HT films.Surface models for the P3HT (010) plane. In each case, the computational cell consisted of five acceptor groups of PCBM or C60 molecules placed on the P3HT surface. The C60 and PCBM were initially placed on the surface with center-to-center separation of at least 20 Å. Two of the fullerene molecules were placed on the P3HT side chains and three on the thiophene rings with the PCBM functional group pointing upward as shown in Fig. S1f.†Surface models for the P3HT (100) plane. Similarly, the C60 and PCBM molecules were arranged along the P3HT side chains of the P3HT film (Fig. S1g†). The PCBM and C60 residues were heterogeneously distributed on the P3HT (100) plane with a center-to-center distance of at least 20 Å. As an alternative model for edge-on orientation we used a sample with 80 10-mer P3HT chains and 6 PCBM molecules. RR and RRa P3HT chains were used for this model.Minimization. Prior to the production run, the thiophene chains and fullerene molecules were subjected to 1000 steps of steepest descent minimization in a vacuum followed by 9000 steps of conjugate gradient minimization.Simulation set up for bulk samples. The bulk systems were gradually heated to 423 K over 2 ns using a temperature coupling constant of 0.1. A short annealing was performed at 423 K for 0.5 ns. Then the system was gradually cooled to 300 K using temperature coupling constants of 1.0 and 0.1 for 3 ns. The production runs were performed for at least 10 ns at 300 K with a 0.2 fs time step. The Lennard-Jones interactions were truncated at 10 Å. Other details of the simulations are described previously.41Simulation set up for amorphous samples. The systems were first gradually heated to 300 K over 1 ns, and then constant volume simulations were performed at 300 K for 0.5 ns followed by constant pressure simulations at 1 atm pressure with a pressure relaxation of 0.001 ns until the systems attained the desired volume with convergence of energy and density within 1.5 ns. Then the systems were gradually heated at constant volume to 423 K over 2 ns. A short annealing was performed at 423 K for 0.5 ns. Then the systems were gradually cooled to 300 K over 3 ns. The production runs were performed for 10 ns at 300 K.Simulation set-up for surfaces. The final coordinates of the energy-minimized P3HT films were used. PCBM and C60 molecules were positioned on the energy-minimized P3HT film. We used (010) and (100) P3HT planes for our study. After adding the PCBM and C60 molecules periodic boundary conditions were imposed to mimic an infinite film. Each system was gradually heated to 423 K and 300 K with restraints of 1.0 kcal mol−1. Production runs were performed for 15 ns with a 1 fs time step at 423 K and 300 K in separate simulations. All simulations were carried out using constant volume, and the temperature was controlled using a Berendsen thermostat. Analyses were performed using PTRAJ modules, VMD,42 and in-house codes. 3D occupancy plots were generated to show the translocation path as a function of time for the PCBM and C60 on the P3HT surface. Changes in solvation and gas-phase free energy were calculated using the Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Solvation Approach (MMGBSA).43Cluster analysis. To detect the most probable and stable configuration of PCBMs we adopted statistical cluster analysis,44,45 which is used to calculate the number of structurally distinct classes visited during the simulations for each configuration. A hierarchical k-mean method based on Euclidian distances was used.46 The clustering algorithm requires both sets of parameters to describe objects' proximity of data points; here, we used MSD and a cut-off radius. The cut-off radius of 0.6 nm was chosen to separate conformations based on the mean square displacement of the fullerene in each configuration. This analysis takes into account the free rotational motion of the PCBM nanoparticles with respect to their initial position and orientation with respect to the P3HT chains.Diffusion coefficient. Diffusion coefficients for each nanoparticle were calculated using the Einstein relationship from the mean square deviation of the residues:6D = limt→∞d〈r2〉/dtwhere the mean square displacement is defined by 〈r2〉.Residence time of PCBM on a P3HT surface. To analyse the residence time of PCBMs at different parts of the surface we assumed a grid on the P3HT (010) plane separating the backbone and arms of the P3HT plane, and the occupancy of each PCBM residues was extracted every 0.04 ns from the trajectories.Results and discussionClustering of PCBMs in P3HTAggregation of the fullerenes is related to their transport properties and stability of the aggregates. As a measure of PCBM transport, we calculated the average mean square displacement (MSD) of the fullerene derivatives as a function of their initial orientation with respect to the polymer chain (Fig. 1a). In the course of simulations PCBMs undergo rotational and translational motion and their final configurations change as compared to the initial. Our results show that the diffusion of PCBMs depends on the orientation and decreases in the following order: dddd > rlrl > dudu > rrrr > C60 > dldl (Fig. 1a). The slowest diffusion is achieved when PCBM molecules are oriented with their functional groups parallel to the polymer chain as in ‘dldl’ and ‘rrrr’ configurations, which is comparable to the mobility of C60. We do not observe any intercalation of the C60 or PCBM molecules in the P3HT side chains; similar observations were made from the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies on the local molecular structures at the interfaces.38 Fig. 1  (a) Mean square displacement and (b) binding energy of the PCBM and C60 as a function of initial orientation with respect to P3HT chains. Black circles represent binding energy of fullerenes with a P3HT backbone and red squares represent binding energy of fullerenes with P3HT side chains. Statistical cluster analysis46 was used to identify the most probable and stable configurations adopted by PCBM molecules (Fig. 2). Stability and orientation of the PCBMs are related to the number of clusters and groups of similar configurations formed during the trajectory (Fig. 2 and S2†). We found that the PCBM “rrrr” and C60 configurations have the highest stability and slowest diffusion due to strong interactions between the fullerenes (Fig. 2e and f). The most unstable conformations, as indicated by the highest number of clusters, are “dudu” and “rlrl” with 25 to 30 distinct clusters detected during the simulations. Fig. 2  (a–f) Snapshots of the best conformation states of the PCBMs from the highest populated cluster for each bulk simulation. (g) Number of clusters from the entire trajectory for each configuration. The configuration “rlrl” is the most unstable in terms of rotational and translational motion, which may be explained by the steric effects between functional groups. It is interesting to note that through the trajectory the “dddd” configuration changes gradually to assume the “rrrr” configuration (Fig. 2a) which explains the decrease in the number of clusters. Overall, our results show that the diffusion and stability of PCBM aggregates are related to the orientation of the PCBM functional group with respect to other PCBMs and P3HTs. Moreover, the most tightly bound cluster of PCBMs with lowest diffusion and enhanced stability, “rrrr”, resembles the PCBM FCC crystal structure as viewed down the [110] direction.38Experimental studies of P3HT:PCBM films indicated that preferred orientation of PCBM nanocrystals in the film could be induced by the observed preferred orientation of the surrounding P3HT chains.47 To investigate the role of the PCBM functional group (tail) in the properties of the polymer blends we compare the binding energies of PCBM with the P3HT backbone versus P3HT side chains (arms) (Fig. 1b). We found that increase in PCBM cluster stability is correlated with stronger binding of PCBMs to the P3HT backbone in all configurations as indicated by black circles in Fig. 1b. There is a variation in the binding energy contribution by P3HT side chains and P3HT backbone with PCBMs/C60s for different configurations. For example, the increased stability of the PCBMs in configuration ‘rrrr’ may be explained by stronger interactions of PCBMs with the P3HT backbone. Also the higher stability of the “rrrr” configuration is attributed to the higher binding energy of the PCBMs with P3HTs, and in this configuration the binding energy value is close to that of C60 and P3HTs.To understand the effect of stacking interactions between the fullerenes and P3HT backbone we measured the interaction energy between fullerene cage and thiophene ring of P3HT. The interaction energy of the C60 hexagon with the P3HT thiophene ring was 0.02 eV lower than the interaction energy of the C60 pentagon facing the thiophene ring. Thus the stronger binding may be associated with the interaction of the fullerene pentagonal rings with thiophene rings of P3HT.Diffusion of PCBM molecules in amorphous P3HTExperimental studies show that diffusion of PCBM into P3HT occurs mainly within P3HT amorphous regions and without disrupting ordered regions of P3HT.10,14 We examined the interactions of PCBMs in a disordered P3HT matrix using 3:1 and 7:1 weight ratios of P3HT to PCBM. To quantify the stacking interactions between components we measured the distance between centroids of P3HT thiophene rings, the distance between centroids of PCBMs, and the distance between centroids of P3HT thiophene rings and centroids of nearby PCBM pentagonal rings (Fig. 3). The analyses show that while P3HTs can form pi–pi stacking interactions, as can be illustrated by the peaks at a distance of 3.9–4.8 Å (Fig. 3a), the P3HT matrix stays largely disordered. While we observe some interactions between PCBMs and P3HTs at a distance of 9 Å (Fig. 3c), the binding energy between PCBM and P3HT in the amorphous domains is only about 10 kcal mol−1, which is much less than the interaction energy between PCBM–PCBM and P3HT–P3HT. In amorphous P3HTs, PCBMs tend to rapidly aggregate into clusters (Fig. 3b) independent of the weight ratio. The most common distance between the centroids of PCBM molecules in these clusters is ∼10 Å, which resembles that of the energetically stable simple cubic crystal packing.48 While the initial diffusion of individual PCBMs is fast, the aggregate of PCBM has a slow diffusion at 300 K. Thus, the calculated average diffusion coefficient of PCBM molecules in amorphous P3HT is 3.14 × 10−9 cm2 s−1 at 300 K and 120 × 10−9 cm2 s−1 at 423 K (Table 1), which is in agreement with experimental calculations of the interdiffusion of PCBM into amorphous P3HT at a rate of 3 × 10−10 cm2 s−1 at 423 K.14 In amorphous regions the diffusion of individual particles is limited due to rapid formation of aggregates.

The distance is defined as the distance between the centroids of P3HT thiophene rings and centroids of PCBMs.

Final snapshots and diffusion path (red lines) of PCBMs on (e) (010) and (f) (100) P3HT surfaces. Dynamics of PCBMs on a (010) plane or face-on orientation of P3HTOn a (010) surface all PCBMs independent of their initial location tend to move and accumulate on the P3HT backbone. Contour plots show the residence time of PCBMs on the P3HT (010) surface (Fig. 4d). The peaks show that PCBMs prefer to reside and diffuse largely along the P3HT backbone, which can also be seen on the diffusion path. To understand the role of P3HT side chains on interfacial dynamics, we simulated P3HT surfaces with and without restraint on the P3HT side chains. Unrestrained side chains lead to accelerated dynamics of PCBM molecules (Fig. S3e†), which resulted in broader occupancy peaks of the PCBM molecules on the P3HT surface (Fig. S3d†). However, the dynamics of the side chains is not essential since PCBMs exhibit the same dynamical behaviour and tend to interact with and diffuse along the P3HT backbone on the (010) surface. At 300 K, the diffusion coefficient of the PCBMs interacting with the P3HT backbone is 13.04 × 10−9 cm2 s−1 at 300 K, and for those interacting with the P3HT side chains it is 28.13 × 10−9 cm2 s−1. At 423 K, the average diffusion coefficients of PCBMs increase to 29.7 × 10−9 cm2 s−1 on the P3HT backbone and to 720.9 × 10−9 cm2 s−1 on P3HT side chains.To determine the role of the PCBM functional group on transport properties we compared the diffusion coefficients of the PCBMs with those of C60. We found that C60 diffuses much more slowly on P3HT, as the diffusion coefficients decrease to 8.55 × 10−9 cm2 s−1 on the backbone and to 12.42 × 10−9 cm2 s−1 on the side chains at 300 K (Fig. S4†). Slower diffusion of C60 as compared to PCBM can be attributed to the lack of the functional group which results in stronger interactions of C60 with the thiophene rings.The PCBM–P3HT binding energy distributions can provide an illustration of effects of the P3HT side chains and PCBM functional group on the resulting structure. The molecular mechanics method was used to explore the free energy landscape of the (010) P3HT plane and the energetic barriers at different sites encountered by the C60 and PCBM molecules during the simulation trajectory. The binding energy includes contributions from the van der Waals and electrostatic terms. In Fig. 5 binding energy of the PCBM with P3HT is grouped by the initial position of PCBM and the interactions with side chains or the backbone. We find that both PCBM tail and the fullerene cage bind more efficiently with the thiophene backbone than with the side chains. These energy contributions explain our results on the diffusion path of the PCBMs and C60s on the P3HT (010) surface, where the PCBMs diffused towards and on the P3HT backbone. The most stable configuration results when the PCBM or fullerenes are located on the P3HT backbone. Earlier experimental studies also proposed that after annealing PCBM molecules at the interface with P3HT were in close proximity to the thiophene rings, which could improve charge separation.38 Fig. 5  Binding energy of the PCBM and C60 with the (010) surface of P3HT at 300 K. The three points in each line represent binding energy of PCBM with the P3HT side chains, P3HT backbone and total P3HT chain. Dynamics on a P3HT (100) plane or edge-on orientation of P3HTDiffusion of PCBMs on the (100) surface of P3HT is very rapid and results in formation of PCBM clusters (Fig. 4f and 6e). The diffusion of PCBM or C60 on the (100) plane is much faster than that on the (010) plane and the average diffusion coefficient increases substantially with the temperature (Table 1). We also repeated our simulations on the edge-on orientation with regiorandom (RRa) and regioregular (RR) P3HT chains (Fig. 6). While PCBMs aggregate rapidly on the RR-P3HT (100) plane, the aggregation is significantly reduced on RRa-P3HT (Fig. S5†). The average diffusion coefficient of PCBMs also decreases on RRa-P3HT (Table 1). The decrease in the PCBM diffusion coefficient on RRa-P3HT is attributed to the intercalation of PCBMs between neighboring P3HT side chains. In RR-P3HT the average distance between neighboring side chains is about 6.1 Å; however, in RRa-P3HT the distance between some neighboring side chains of RRa increases upto 8.5 Å due to its chemical structure (Fig. 6a and b). The size of a PCBM cage is smaller than the distance between neighboring RRa-P3HT allowing for intercalation of PCBMs into the RRa-P3HT (100) plane. Overall, the fastest diffusion of PCBM was observed on edge-on orientation of P3HT. Fig. 6  Structure of (a) regiorandom and (b) regioregular P3HT chains.

ConclusionsIn this study, we used atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to delineate the factors affecting diffusion of PCBM into P3HT in an amorphous material and around crystalline surfaces. Our studies showed that PCBM and C60 tend to aggregate in amorphous P3HT and on the (100) surface. In an amorphous sample these aggregates are much more rapidly formed than on the (100) surface, which leads to a reduction of the average diffusion coefficient of individual fullerene particles. However, the diffusion of PCBM and C60 on the (010) surface of P3HT is governed by the preferential binding of the fullerene cage to the thiophene ring and only small clusters of two to three PCBMs can be formed. The cluster stability is correlated with the strength of PCBM and P3HT backbone interactions. Moreover, such strong binding of fullerene cages (both PCBM and C60) with the thiophene backbone led to their slow and directional diffusion on the thiophene backbone on the (010) surface. The diffusion on (010) is the slowest even at high temperatures. The presence of the functional group in PCBM can be attributed to an increase in the diffusion coefficient by a factor of 1.5 to 2 times as compared to C60. It is interesting to note that low regioregularity of P3HTs reduced the diffusion and aggregation of the PCBMs.AcknowledgementsThis work was partially supported by the NSF's Research Triangle MRSEC (DMR-1121107).
