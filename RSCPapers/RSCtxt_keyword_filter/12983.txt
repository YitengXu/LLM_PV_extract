    , Accepted 30th June 2015First published on 3rd July 2015AbstractTo explore the effectiveness of monofluorinated isoindigo as an electron-deficient building block in push–pull conjugated polymers for organic solar cell applications, four low bandgap copolymers are effectively synthesized and characterized. The effects of fluorine introduction, thiophene spacer length and polymer molar mass on the general electro-optical polymer characteristics, thin film blend microstructure and electronic performance are investigated. Isoindigo monofluorination effectively improves the power conversion efficiency from 2.8 up to 5.0% upon molar mass optimization, without using any processing additives or post-treatments.
Introduction
During the last decade, increasing attention has been devoted to global warming and sustainable energy production, which has stimulated scientists worldwide to intensify their research efforts towards alternative green energy sources. Solar energy is obviously an attractive renewable technology due to its inherent abundant and non-depletable character. Conjugated polymers represent promising materials to produce cost-effective large area organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices.1 Polymer solar cells can rather easily be fabricated using various coating techniques, ranging from laboratory-scale spin or spray coating to large-scale printing technologies.2–4 Material and device scientists have been working hard to develop a plethora of novel polymer structures and device architectures to improve the performance of the photovoltaic devices, resulting in a significant progress in power conversion efficiency (PCE).5–9 Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells based on low bandgap donor copolymers and (methano)fullerene acceptors have recently afforded efficiencies over 10% for single-junction devices and up to 11.8% for triple-junctions.10–16 One of the most critical challenges in developing ideal donor polymers is to come up with materials with a narrow optical bandgap and strong absorption coefficient spanning the whole visible up to the near-infrared region, in order to harvest a maximum of solar photons through thin active layers. Broad and strong absorption, appropriate miscibility with the fullerene acceptor and high hole mobility are required to ensure good charge separation and high short-circuit current density (Jsc). Moreover, suitable highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels are necessary to guarantee a high open-circuit voltage (Voc). The commonly applied strategy to achieve these requirements is the combination of electron-rich (donor) and electron-deficient (acceptor) repeating units, creating intramolecular charge transfer which leads to a narrowing of the bandgap.17–20
Many electron-deficient heteroaromatic units such as benzothiadiazole (BT),21 thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (TzTz),22–24 quinoxaline (Qx),25 thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD),26 diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP),27 and isoindigo (IID)28–30 have been used to construct low bandgap donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers with steadily increasing polymer solar cell performance. Because of its large optical transition dipole (due to the two lactam rings) and strong electron-withdrawing character, isoindigo stands out as one of the most promising building blocks in the field of organic electronics.10 The Reynolds group reported the first example of an isoindigo-based D–A small molecule in 2010, showing a favorable absorption spectrum and energy levels well aligned with those of the fullerene acceptors.31 Since then, a variety of isoindigo-based D–A conjugated materials has been successfully incorporated in organic solar cells, affording moderate to high efficiencies.10,29,30,32,33 On the other hand, multiple studies have shown that the molar mass of the conjugated polymers can affect the effective conjugated chain length, and thus lead to varying opto-electronic properties.34–40
Fluorine substitution onto low bandgap copolymers has become a popular strategy to increase the efficiency of polymer solar cells.9,25,39,41–44 The possibility to fine-tune the electron affinity of isoindigo-based polymers by fluorine substitution thus constitutes an interesting route to design new D–A copolymers for improved photovoltaic performance.19,45,46 Pei et al. demonstrated that fluorine introduction can effectively lower the HOMO and LUMO levels of isoindigo-based copolymers and significantly increase their charge carrier mobility.45 On the other hand, Peng and co-workers47 showed that D–A copolymers based on fluorinated isoindigo (FIID) adopt a more favorable conformation arising from F–H, F–S and F–F.33,45 Solar cells based on these FIID copolymers showed PCE's of 5.5% with a high Voc up to 0.94 V.47 On the other hand, Wang et al.32,48 and Su et al.49 recently reported the beneficial effect of a bithiophene spacer in isoindigo-based D–A copolymers, improving the planarity of the main chains and enhancing their π–π stacking tendency. PCE's as high as 7.3% were obtained employing such copolymers. Based on these separate promising observations, we aimed to investigate the combined effects of isoindigo monofluorination and thiophene spacer length on the opto-electronic and photovoltaic properties. Both non-fluorinated (IID) and monofluorinated isoindigo (FIID) precursors were synthesized and coupled with dialkoxy-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) or oligothiophene (T) donor parts to obtain four different copolymers (see Scheme 1).

Experimental
Instrumentation
NMR spectra of monomers and polymers were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE 250 or 400 MHz spectrometer, respectively. Polymer molar masses and distributions were determined with an Agilent high temperature GPC equipped with PDA, RI and LS detectors using a Plgel 10 μm Mixed B column and ortho-dichlorobenzene at 140 °C as the eluent. Optical absorption spectra were taken on a Cary 500 scan UV-Vis spectrometer. Electrochemical measurements were performed with an Eco Chemie Autolab PGSTAT 30 potentiostat/galvanostat using a three-electrode microcell with a platinum wire working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode and an anhydrous Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode (Ag/0.1 M NBu4PF6 in MeCN containing 0.01 M AgNO3). Polymers were deposited onto the working electrode from chloroform solutions. The samples were analyzed in anhydrous acetonitrile containing 0.1 M NBu4PF6. The electrolyte solution was degassed with Ar prior to each measurement. To prevent air from entering the system, a curtain of Ar was maintained during the experiments. Cyclic voltammograms were recorded at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The HOMO and LUMO frontier energy levels were calculated from the equation E(HOMO/LUMO) (eV) = −1X (Eonsetox/redvs. Ag/AgNO3 − EonsetFc/Fc+vs. Ag/AgNO3) − 4.98. The onset potentials were referenced to ferrocene/ferrocenium, which has an ionization potential of −4.98 eV vs. vacuum. This correction factor is based on a value of 0.31 eV for Fc/Fc+vs. SCE50 and a value of 4.68 eV for SCE vs. vacuum.51

Solar cell and transistor fabrication and analysis
The photovoltaic devices were fabricated using pre-patterned ITO-coated glass substrates. They were cleaned with detergent, followed by ultrasonication in water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol. After complete drying, the ITO-coated glass substrates were treated with UV/ozone for 15 min. As a buffer layer, PEDOT:PSS (CLEVIOS P VP.Al 4083) was spin-coated onto the ITO-coated glass substrates, followed by annealing at 120 °C for 15 min to remove any residual water. The substrates were then transferred into a glove box filled with N2, where the active layers were spin-coated from ortho-dichlorobenzene, chlorobenzene or chloroform solutions, aiming at thicknesses of ∼100 nm (determined using a DektakST3 surface profiler). The active layer solutions consisted of any of the four polymers and PC71BM (Solenne) in different ratios and concentrations. To completely dissolve the polymers, the solutions were stirred overnight at 80 °C. Immediately after spin-coating, the substrates were placed in a Petri dish to slowly dry the thin films. The annealed devices were heated at 120 °C for 5 min in a nitrogen atmosphere. Finally, the cathode double-layer was deposited by thermal evaporation of Ca (30 nm) and Al (80 nm). Devices with 3 mm2 area were obtained. PCE's were calculated from the J–V characteristics recorded on a Keithley 2400 under AM1.5 conditions supplied by a Newport class A solar simulator (model 91195A). External quantum efficiencies were acquired by recording the monochromated (Newport Cornerstone 130 with sorting filters) output of a xenon lamp (100 W, Newport 6257) by a lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research Systems SR830). The light beam was mechanically chopped at 10 Hz. The recorded values were calibrated with a FDS-100 calibrated silicon photodiode.
The hole mobilities of the copolymers were obtained from bottom-gate bottom-contacts OFET devices (n-Si/SiO2/Au/copolymer). The pure copolymers were spin-coated from ortho-dichlorobenzene solutions on n-Si/SiO2/Au substrates. The linear mobility (μ) was extracted operating in the linear regime using devices with a channel length of 10 μm.
Active layer thin film morphologies were characterized by AFM using a PicoPlus5500 microscope (Agilent Technologies) in tapping mode. The images were acquired using silicon cantilevers (Nanosensors, silicon-SPM-sensor, spring constant 10–130 Nm−1, resonance frequency 204–497 kHz). Alternatively, a Bruker Multimode 8 was employed in tapping mode, mounting Bruker's Silicon probes with a spring constant of 42 Nm−1. All images were collected in air and analysed using Gwyddion data analysis software.

Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes towards copolymers PIID-5T, PFIID-5T, PFIID-T-BDT-T and PFIID-2T-BDT-2T and their corresponding precursors are illustrated in Scheme 1. Isoindigo derivatives 1 and 2 were prepared following a reported literature procedure.10 6-Bromooxindole and 6-bromo-7-fluoroisatin were condensed using acetic acid and hydrochloric acid under reflux conditions, affording the non-fluorinated, monofluorinated and difluorinated isoindigo products, which were separated by silica gel chromatography. Subsequently, long 2-octyldodecyl alkyl chains were introduced on the lactam nitrogen atoms to guarantee solubility of the resulting polymers in commonly used solar cell processing solvents. Compounds 1 and 2 were then cross-coupled with 2-trimethylstannylthiophene to afford molecules 3 and 4 in 75 and 84% yield, respectively. Bromination with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in THF afforded the corresponding compounds 5 (66%) and 6 (50%). Product 6 was copolymerized with 2,6-bis(trimethylstannyl)-4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene via Stille polycondensation to afford the first copolymer PFIID-T-BDT-T (in 69% yield). Secondly, products 5 and 6 were further coupled to an additional hexylthiophene unit to yield extended precursors 7 (73%) and 8 (74%). After bromination with NBS, the obtained monomers (9 and 10) were copolymerized with 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene and 2,6-bis(trimethylstannyl)-4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene via Stille polycondensation to provide the corresponding copolymers PIID-5T, PFIID-5T and PFIID-2T-BDT-2T. All polymers were purified by Soxhlet extractions with methanol, acetone and n-hexane and finally recovered with hot chloroform. Two fractions with different molar mass were collected for PFIID-5T by using hot chloroform and hot tetrachloroethane to dissolve the low (PFIID-5T) and high molar mass (PFIID-5T_H) fractions, respectively. The number-average molar mass (Mn) and molar mass distribution (D) of the copolymers were determined by high-temperature gel permeation chromatography (HT-GPC), required due to the high stacking tendency of some of the materials, using 1,2-dichlorobenzene as the eluent (Table 1). All polymers and their precursors were fully characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy.

Fig. 1 illustrates the UV-visible absorption spectra of the four copolymers in chloroform solution and for as-cast thin films (data in Table 1). All polymers show dual absorption bands covering the wavelength range from 350 up to 850 nm. The higher (300–450 nm) and lower energy (450–850 nm) bands can be attributed to π–π* transitions and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the donor and acceptor units of the polymers, respectively. The fluorinated copolymer PFIID-5T shows a red shift compared to the corresponding non-fluorinated copolymer PIID-5T. In fact, PFIID-5T has an absorption maximum of 676 nm in solution and 673 nm in thin film, while PIID-5T shows a slight bathochromic shift upon going from solution (640 nm) to the solid state (649 nm). For conjugated polymers, intermolecular stacking and conformational changes may significantly shift the absorption spectra.53,54 It has previously been stated that the introduction of fluorine atoms can afford F–H, F–F and F–S interactions, affording a more planar backbone, which is consistent with the absorption features observed here.42,45 No significant changes are observed for the two different molar mass fractions of the fluorinated copolymer (PFIID-5T and PFIID-5T_H). Both BDT-based fluorinated copolymers, PFIID-T-BDT-T and PFIID-2T-BDT-2T, show a blue-shifted absorption compared to PFIID-5T. Optical bandgaps were determined from the absorption onsets in the thin-film spectra (Table 1). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to investigate the electrochemical properties of the four polymers and to get a first estimate of their HOMO–LUMO values. The corresponding voltammograms are presented in Fig. 2 and the data are gathered in Table 1. The energies of the HOMO and LUMO levels were derived from the onset potentials of the oxidation and reduction waves, respectively, using the onset potential of the Fc/Fc+ redox couple as a reference. PFIID-5T exhibits a slightly lower (0.07 eV) HOMO level than the corresponding non-fluorinated polymer PIID-5T and a comparable LUMO level. The incorporation of BDT units in PFIID-T-BDT-T and PFIID-2T-BDT-2T results in a lowering of both the HOMO and LUMO energy levels. The HOMO energy levels in D–A copolymers are mainly governed by the donor strength.17 Thus, the weak donor ability of BDT decreases the HOMO values of the BDT-based copolymers. Furthermore, the HOMO energy level of the thiophene-extended PFIID-2T-BDT-2T copolymer is 0.1 eV higher than for PFIID-T-BDT-T, as the donor strength increases by adding an extra thiophene unit. The relatively low HOMO levels of the BDT-based copolymers improve their stability by avoiding unintentional p-doping55 and allow to achieve higher Voc values in polymer solar cells.

Polymer solar cells
The photovoltaic performances of the novel copolymers were evaluated by fabricating conventional BHJ polymer solar cells with a configuration glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al. The fabrication and characterization were performed in a glovebox under nitrogen atmosphere. After extensive optimization (see ESI†), o-dichlorobenzene was selected as the best processing solvent for the photoactive layer. For all the copolymers, the best performance was obtained by spin coating a copolymer:PC71BM blend in a 1:3 w/w ratio. Film thickness and thermal annealing were systematically investigated for all the blends. Performance parameters and representative current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 3, respectively. Optimized BHJ solar cells based on PIID-5T exhibit a PCE of 2.64% (Jsc = 6.51 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.70 V, FF = 58%). The introduction of a fluorine atom onto the isoindigo part (copolymer PFIID-5T) leads to better device performance (Jsc = 9.88 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.61 V, FF = 60%; PCE = 3.64%). The photovoltaic efficiencies were slightly improved after thermal annealing at 120 °C for 5 minutes, leading to enhanced FF and Voc at the expense of Jsc (PIID-5T: Jsc = 6.19 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.71 V, FF = 64%; PCE = 2.83%; PFIID-5T: Jsc = 8.93 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.65 V, FF = 64%; PCE = 3.72%). The observed Voc drop for PFIID-5T does not match with the trend in HOMO values (Table 1), but can have different origins (intermolecular arrangement at the interface, ‘order’,…).56–59 A higher Jsc was obtained upon processing the higher molar mass fraction (PFIID-5T_H), leading to a significant efficiency improvement (Jsc = 13.88 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.59 V, FF = 62%; PCE = 5.03%). Upon blending the PFIID-5T and PFIID-5T_H samples, an intermediate PCE was obtained (Jsc = 10.81 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.59 V, FF = 62%; PCE = 4.00%). For BDT-based copolymer PFIID-T-BDT-T, the Voc strongly improved, as expected by the lower HOMO energy level. Nevertheless, the Jsc dropped considerably and consequently also the PCE (Jsc = 2.66 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.86 V, FF = 57%; PCE = 1.30%). In this case the device performance did not improve after thermal annealing. The incorporation of an additional 3-hexylthiophene unit into the BDT-based copolymer (PFIID-2T-BDT-2T) led to a better BHJ film microstructure (vide infra) and improved device performance (Jsc = 6.33 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.68 V, FF = 57%; PCE = 2.45%), although the Voc decreased upon adding an additional thiophene spacer (as observed before by Wang et al.32). A small efficiency drop is observed in this case upon thermal annealing. Our record device hence afforded a PCE of 5.0% (PFIID-5T_H), without the need for any processing additive. Compared to the top efficiencies (beyond 7%) reported for fluorinated isoindigo-based copolymers (with dithienocarbazole as electron-rich unit) by Wang et al.,33 the reduced PCE can mainly be attributed to the significantly lower Voc value (due to the different donor units).

The external quantum efficiencies (EQE's) of the (non-annealed) polymer solar cell devices were measured as well. The photocurrents obtained by integration of the EQE spectra (PIID-5T = 5.70 mA cm−2, FIID-5T = 8.45 mA cm−2, PFIID-5T_H = 13.55 mA cm−2, PFIID-5T/PFIID-5T_H = 10.68 mA cm−2, PFIID-T-BDT-T = 2.20 mA cm−2 and PFIID-2T-BDT-2T = 5.69 mA cm−2) are comparable to the Jsc values obtained from the J–V measurements. Charge carriers are generated and collected over the full region between 300 and 800 nm for all polymer solar cells (Fig. 4). To test the charge transport capability of the four isoindigo-based materials, field-effect transistors (FET's) with bottom-gate bottom-contact architecture were prepared from polymer solutions deposited and dried into solid thin films on glass/SiO2/HMDS substrates. The FET devices were fabricated and tested under nitrogen atmosphere. The non-fluorinated reference copolymer PIID-5T showed a hole mobility of 1.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Table 2). The incorporation of a fluorine atom (PFIID-5T) slightly increased this value to 9.42 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. No improvement was observed for the high molar mass batch (PFIID-5T_H), showing a hole mobility of 8.95 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The incorporation of an extra hexylthiophene unit for PFIID-2T-BDT-2T improved the photovoltaic performance compared to PFIID-T-BDT-T, although an opposite trend was observed for the hole mobility, which was lower (9.66 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1) for PFIID-2T-BDT-2T compared to PFIID-T-BDT-T (3.39 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). For the BDT-based copolymers, the observed hole mobilities are at least one order of magnitude lower than those for the terthiophene-based donor copolymers.
 Fig. 4  Representative EQE spectra for the non-annealed polymer solar cells. 
To get additional insights in the different photovoltaic performances, the active layer surface morphologies of the best solar cell devices were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Fig. 5a and b show the topography images of the active layers based on PIID-5T and PFIID-5T, respectively. Rather homogeneously dispersed films are formed, without large aggregates. In line with the improved photovoltaic performance (Table 2), the active layer is more homogeneous when using the fluorinated isoindigo copolymer (PFIID-5T). On one side, this can be due to additional F–H, F–S and F–F interactions, influencing polymer aggregation and mixing with the fullerene acceptor.33,45 On the other hand, higher molar mass polymers tend to afford more favourable active layer morphologies.34–40 Indeed, as shown in Fig. 5c and d, the homogeneity of the active layer was further improved when the high molar mass batch PFIID-5T_H was employed, confirming the enhanced photovoltaic performance. The AFM images also support the inferior Jsc achieved for the PFIID-T-BDT-T based devices (Fig. 5e). The supramolecular organization significantly improved for PFIID-2T-BDT-2T (Fig. 5f), affording a much finer morphology and smaller domain sizes, leading to a strong increase in Jsc and a nearly doubled PCE value.

Conclusions
Three push–pull copolymers based on the electron-poor 6,6′-dibromo-7-fluoroisoindigo unit were efficiently synthesized and compared to an analogous non-fluorinated copolymer from an optoelectronic and photovoltaic point of view. As electron-rich components, either oligothiophene or benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene building blocks were applied. The effects of fluorine substitution, thiophene spacer length and polymer molar mass were evaluated. Best solar cell results (PCE = 5.03%) were obtained for the PFIID-5T_H copolymer with highest molar mass, consistent with the highest hole mobility and most favorable active layer blend morphology, without using any processing additives or post-treatments. Both BDT-based copolymers showed reduced power conversion efficiencies, despite the enhanced open-circuit voltages. Supramolecular organization within the photoactive layer improved by increasing the number of thiophene spacers in PFIID-2T-BDT-2T, leading to an enhanced Jsc and higher PCE, despite a reduced Voc and lower hole mobility. Current efforts within our groups are devoted to further exploration of novel low bandgap copolymers and small molecules based on the 6,6′-dibromo-7-fluoroisoindigo moiety for photovoltaic and photodetector applications.
