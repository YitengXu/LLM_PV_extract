    , Accepted 23rd May 2019First published on 5th June 2019AbstractTernary organic solar cells (OSCs) have shown tremendous potential in improving the photovoltaic performance of single-junction OSCs. Here, a series of ternary OSCs are fabricated with PM7:ITC-2Cl as the host system and an ultra-low bandgap acceptor named IXIC-4Cl that has an absorption edge reaching 1000 nm as the third component. The optimal ternary OSC shows a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.37%, which is significantly higher than those of the binary counterparts based on PM7:ITC-2Cl (13.72%) or PM7:IXIC-4Cl (12.01%). The excellent PCE is mainly attributed to the increased short-circuit current (JSC), which mainly arises from the complementary absorption of the third component and thus the overall broadened absorption profile. In addition, the addition of IXIC-4Cl into the PM7:ITC-2Cl binary system suppresses bimolecular recombination, improves charge dissociation and the collection efficiency, balances charge transport and reduces the domain size, which are responsible for the enhanced JSC. Noticeably, the optimized ternary device shows a PCE over 15% with a quite small energy loss, which are the best results for ternary OSCs to date. These results offer more insight into the role of an ultra-low bandgap non-fullerene acceptor as the third component in promoting the device performance of ternary OSCs.

Broader context
In the past decade, more and more attention has been paid to organic solar cells (OSCs) due to their advantages such as light weight, flexibility and low fabrication costs. The active layer of an organic solar cell is usually made up of an electron donor and an electron acceptor. The traditional electron acceptors, known as fullerene derivatives, suffer several drawbacks including poor absorption in the visible region, limited energy level variability, and high synthesis and purification costs. Fortunately, the recent emergence of nonfullerene acceptors overcomes these limitations and enables OSCs to move forward on a new journey. Thus, non-fullerene OSCs have developed rapidly in the last few years, including single-junction binary, ternary and multijunction (e.g., tandem) OSCs. Among them, ternary OSCs not only maintain the simplicity of the single-junction device architecture, but also offer many other advantages as discussed in the following. In this work, a series of ternary OSCs were fabricated with PM7:ITC-2Cl as the host system and an ultra-low bandgap acceptor of IXIC-4Cl as the third component. The optimal ternary device achieved an excellent PCE of 15.37% with a quite low energy loss of 0.42 eV, which are the best results for ternary OSCs to date.

Introduction
In the past two decades, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) has made a great breakthrough.1–5 The rapid progress of OSCs can be mainly ascribed to the combined innovation of materials and device engineering.6–10 Nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) materials, as the mainstream of current OSC research, have attracted widespread attention due to their strong light absorption, and easily tunable absorption range, energy levels and chemical structure.11–22 The PCEs of OSCs based on NFAs have exceeded 15%, outperforming fullerene-based OSCs.23–30 However, the absorption profile of a common OSC material is relatively narrow. A binary OSC typically exhibits absorption edges in the range of 700–800 nm, which could be the bottleneck for JSC enhancement.31–38 To further improve the photovoltaic performance, widening the absorption range is essential. In general, there are two main approaches.
The first strategy is to construct a tandem device, where two or more subcells with complementary absorption spectra are connected in series.23,26,39–41 Although the tandem device has achieved a PCE over 17%, the high cost and complicated preparation process limit its further application.42–44 On the contrary, the other strategy is to fabricate ternary blend OSCs, which not only can broaden the absorption spectra (through proper material combination), but also inherit the simplicity of single-junction OSCs.45–47 Early research on ternary systems focused on one donor and two fullerene acceptors (or two donors and one fullerene acceptor).48,49 However, the disadvantages of fullerene derivatives, including difficulty in adjusting the energy levels and weak light absorption, hinder the advancement of device performance.50–52 The current popular ternary systems typically include two acceptors, either two NFAs or one NFA accompanied by one fullerene acceptor, which could cover a wide absorption range. For instance, Zhang and coworkers utilized BDTThIT-4F and a low bandgap molecule named COi8DFIC (Eg = 1.26 eV) as the two acceptors to construct ternary OSCs that yielded high PCEs over 13%.53 Chen's group fabricated ternary devices with PCEs as high as 13.54% by employing PC71BM and an ultra-low bandgap molecule named 3TT-FIC (Eg = 1.25 eV) as acceptors.51 These results indicate the great potential of low bandgap NFA-based ternary OSCs. Despite ultra-low bandgap acceptors having been studied in ternary OSCs,53–55 employing them as a third component to modulate the properties of wide-bandgap polymer donor-based OSCs has rarely been reported. Meanwhile, studying this ternary system could offer a more comprehensive understanding on the working mechanisms of non-fullerene ternary OSCs.
In this contribution, we employed a NFA named IXIC-4Cl with an absorption edge reaching 1000 nm (Eg = 1.24 eV) as a third component to improve the light absorption and morphology of the host binary system composed of a wide-bandgap polymer donor (PM7) and our recently reported high-performance acceptor ITC-2Cl.56–58 The PM7:ITC-2Cl binary device showed a PCE of 13.72%. Furthermore, the PM7:IXIC-4Cl-based binary device also yielded a high PCE of 12.01% even though the offset of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels (ΔEHOMO(D–A)) between PM7 and IXIC-4Cl is close to 0. Due to the extended and complementary absorption of IXIC-4Cl, the combination of the three materials (PM7, ITC-2Cl and IXIC-4Cl) covers a broad spectrum from visible to near-infrared (∼400–1000 nm). As a result, the PCEs of the PM7:ITC-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl ternary device were significantly improved. Notably, the champion ternary device (PM7:ITC-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl = 1:0.5:0.5) delivered a PCE as high as 15.37%. This excellent PCE is mainly due to the increased JSC, which arises from the improved morphology and broadened absorption. It is worth mentioning that the optimal ternary device (PCE > 15%) showed a very small energy loss of 0.42 eV. This small energy loss and the high PCE are the best results for nonfullerene ternary OSCs to date. These results demonstrate the prospects of ultra-low bandgap NFAs for further improvement of the photovoltaic performance of single-junction OSCs regardless of the polymer donor bandgap in the binary system.
Result and discussion
A series of OSCs were fabricated with PM7 as the donor and ITC-2Cl (binary), IXIC-4Cl (binary) or ITC-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl (ternary) as the acceptor. Fig. 1a displays the chemical structures of PM7, ITC-2Cl and IXIC-4Cl, as well as the device structure. The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) method was employed to investigate the HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the materials (Fig. S1 in the ESI†), and the corresponding energy level diagrams are shown in Fig. 1b. The HOMO energy level of PM7 (−5.51 eV) is slightly higher than that of ITC-2Cl (−5.58 eV), and almost the same as that of IXIC-4Cl (−5.52 eV). The neat PM7 film displays strong absorption in the wavelength range of 350–680 nm, which is very complementary to the absorption spectra of the two acceptors. Noticeably, the absorption edge of IXIC-4Cl is about 1000 nm, and the corresponding optical band gap (Eg) is 1.24 eV. Fig. 1d presents the absorption spectra of the blend films with different compositions. The PM7:ITC-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl (1:0.5:0.5) blend film shows relatively high maximum extinction coefficients at 619, 748 and 856 nm, which is beneficial for achieving a high JSC. It is worth noting that the PM7:ITC-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl (1:0.5:0.5) ternary blend film shows a broad spectral range from 350 to 1000 nm.

To evaluate the photovoltaic properties of the binary or ternary OSCs, we fabricated a conventional device structure: ITO/PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate))/active layer/ZrAcac (zirconium acetylacetonate)/Al. Fig. 2a illustrates the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of all the OSCs, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table 1. The PM7:ITC-2Cl-based binary device yields a PCE of 13.72%, with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.915 V, a JSC of 20.27 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.739, which are comparable to our previous results. In contrast, the PM7:IXIC-4Cl-based device exhibits a lower PCE of 12.01%, with an enhanced JSC (21.60 mA cm−2) but reduced VOC (0.795 V) and FF (0.699). Both binary devices achieved a high FF (∼0.70), suggesting efficient charge separation and transport. In order to further promote the device performance, we prepared ternary devices with different IXIC-4Cl contents. It is apparent that the JSCs of the ternary OSCs increase first and then decrease with the increased content of IXIC-4Cl. When the weight percentage of IXIC-4Cl in the acceptors is below 0.5, the FF is similar to the PM7:ITIC-2Cl binary device. The champion cell was realized at a composition of PM7:ITC-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl = 1:0.5:0.5 (weight ratio) and the device showed an impressive PCE as high as 15.37%, with a VOC of 0.857 V, a JSC of 23.99 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.747. To the best of our knowledge, the 15.37% is the highest PCE reported so far for ternary OSCs (Fig. 2c and Table S1 in the ESI†). It is worth mentioning that the energy loss (Eloss), defined as Eloss = Eg − eVOC (where Eg is calculated using the onset of the EQE spectrum), is only 0.42 eV in the PM7:ITC-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl (1:0.5:0.5) ternary device, which is significantly smaller than most reported Elosss. These results indicate that the third component (IXIC-4Cl) considerably increased the JSC while allowing the cell to reach a high VOC in the meantime through a low voltage loss.

The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra are shown in Fig. 2b. The integrated JSCs from the IPCE spectra are summarized in Table 1, which match well with the values from the J–V curves within 3% error. Apparently, the increase in PCE, i.e. from the PM7:ITC-2Cl-based binary device (13.72%) to the optimal ternary device (15.37%), is high among the reported ternary OSCs (Fig. 2c). In order to confirm the reliability of the champion PCE of the PM7:ITC-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl-based ternary device, we sent it to the National Institute of Metrology, China (NIM) for certification. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), a certified PCE of 14.32% (with a VOC of 0.854 V, a JSC of 23.72 mA cm−2, and an FF of 70.7%) was recorded. We note that the slight decrease in PCE could be attributed to the device structure (conventional), which is not optimized for device longevity. Apart from the device performance, we also investigated the device stability. The starting points of the PCE for the stability test are 13.63%, 11.77% and 15.25% for the two binary devices and the optimal ternary device, which are slightly lower than the champion PCEs but higher than the average PCEs of the corresponding cells. As shown in Fig. 2d, the packaged PM7:ITC-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl-based device in air maintained 92% of its initial PCE after 2 days, which is consistent with the certified PCE. Interestingly, the introduction of IXIC-4Cl into the PM7:ITC-2Cl binary system improved the device stability, and the PM7:ITC-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl-based device can maintain 75% PCE after 30 days, which is higher than that of the PM7:ITC-2Cl-based device (70%).
To investigate whether there is charge/energy transfer between ITC-2Cl and IXIC-4Cl, we measured the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of neat ITC-2Cl, neat IXIC-4Cl and their blend films with different compositions under a 760 nm excitation wavelength. As shown in Fig. 3a, ITC-2Cl exhibits broad and strong PL emission at ∼816 nm, and IXIC-4Cl shows relatively weak emission at ∼970 nm. As shown in Fig. 3a, in ITC-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl blend films, adding IXIC-4Cl into ITC-2Cl makes the PL intensity of ITC-2Cl decrease and, in the meantime, the PL intensity of the blend in the low energy region increases compared to the PL intensity of the pure IXIC-4Cl film. Since IXIC-4Cl is the low bandgap component, this result is a clear indication of energy transfer from ITC-2Cl to IXIC-4Cl. In addition, a series of OSCs were prepared with neat ITC-4Cl or IXIC-4Cl or their blend films with different IXIC-4Cl contents to further investigate the intermolecular interaction between ITC-4Cl and IXIC-4Cl (Fig. 3b). The devices based on the neat ITC-2Cl or IXIC-4Cl film yielded JSC values of 0.035 and 0.306 mA cm−2, respectively. The solar cells using ITC-2Cl and IXIC-4Cl blends achieved JSC values below 0.30 mA cm−2. These results demonstrate that there is no charge-transfer between ITC-2Cl and IXIC-4Cl.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were carried out to understand the effect of IXIC-4Cl on the morphology of the active layer (Fig. 4a). As shown in AFM height images, the optimal ternary, PM7:ITC-2Cl and PM7:IXIC-4Cl-based blend films exhibit uniform and smooth surface morphologies, but the optimal ternary blend film gives the smallest root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.939 nm. In addition, in AFM phase images, all the blend films display well-distributed nanofibrillar texture, where the optimal ternary blend yields a smaller and more uniform domain size relative to the other two blend films. To confirm the small domain size, grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) experiments were performed (Fig. 4b and Fig. S3, ESI†). To account for the scattering contribution from the pure phase domain sizes and intermixing amorphous phase, fractal-like network and Debye–Anderson–Brumberger models were employed to fit the data,59 respectively. The pure phase domain sizes (2Rg) are calculated to be 14.5, 25.6 and 23.2 nm for the optimal ternary, PM7:ITC-2Cl and PM7:IXIC-4Cl-based films, respectively. A low pure phase domain size in the optimal ternary film is beneficial to exciton dissociation and transport. The corresponding intermixing domain sizes are estimated to be 30.6, 52.9 and 52.1 nm for the optimal ternary, PM7:ITC-2Cl and PM7:IXIC-4Cl-based films, respectively. The smallest intermixing phase for the optimal ternary blend film is well consistent with the results observed in AFM phase images, which is favourable for improving the charge collection and reducing the charge recombination.

To gain insight into the role of IXIC-4Cl in the active layer morphology, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was utilized to investigate the molecular packing and orientation (Fig. 5 and Fig. S4, ESI†). As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the PM7, ITC-2Cl and IXIC-4Cl neat films demonstrate preferential face-on orientation, which is beneficial to the charge transport. In addition, compared with ITC-2Cl, IXIC-4Cl exhibits a different direction for lamellar (100) packing. The (100) reflections of the IXIC-4Cl and ITC-2Cl neat films were observed at qxy = 0.34 and 0.46 Å−1, corresponding to a d-spacing of 18.5 and 13.7 Å, respectively. Also, IXIC-4Cl shows a much increased crystal coherence length (CCL) (IXIC-4Cl = 2.35 nm; ITC-2Cl = 1.60 nm) in the π–π stacking direction, which is beneficial for charge transport. Apparently, the PM7:IXIC-4Cl blend film exhibits two different diffraction peaks in both the in-plane (0.30 and 0.44 Å−1) and out-of-plane direction (1.54 and 1.80 Å−1). As seen from the 50% IXIC-4Cl loading sample, a new in-plane diffraction at 0.43 Å−1 corresponding to the characteristic of IXIC-4Cl is observed, which grows with the increasing content of IXIC-4Cl. The π–π stacking peak at 3.47 Å−1 can be seen in the out-of-plane direction after 70% IXIC-4Cl, which reflects the crystalline nature of IXIC-4Cl. These results suggest that the crystalline properties of ITC-2Cl and IXIC-4Cl exist simultaneously in the PM7:ITC-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl (1:0.5:0.5) blend film.

Apart from studying the active layer morphology, we also investigated the mechanism of charge collection and exciton dissociation in the active layers, and the corresponding curves of photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) of the optimal ternary and binary OSCs are shown in Fig. 6a. In addition, the saturation Jph (Jsat), exciton dissociation efficiency (ηdiss) and charge collection efficiency (ηcoll) can be estimated from the curves of Jph and Veff, and the related data are shown in Table S2 (ESI†). The ηdiss values are 96.8%, 97.6% and 92.2% for devices with 0%, 50%, and 100% IXIC-4Cl contents, respectively. ηcoll displays the same trend as ηdiss, which demonstrates that the addition of IXIC-4Cl into the ternary blends improved exciton dissociation and the charge collection efficiency simultaneously. As shown in Fig. 6b, we investigated the relationship between VOC and the IXIC-4Cl weight ratio in the blend films. The VOC of the ternary devices was almost linearly dependent on the weight ratio of IXIC-4Cl, which is similar to our recently reported results.31

In order to investigate the charge-recombination in the binary and optimal ternary devices, we studied the relationship between JSC and light intensity (P) (Fig. 6c), which can be evaluated by the powerlaw formula of JSC ∝ PSlight. In general, the power-law exponent S is close to 1, implying weak bimolecular recombination occurred in the active layers. The S values are 0.955 and 0.949 for the devices based on PM7:ITC-2Cl and PM7:IXIC-4Cl blends, respectively. Compared with the binary device, the optimized ternary device yields a larger S value of 0.978, indicating that addition of IXIC-4Cl suppress the bimolecular recombination, and thus contributes to the high JSC. Furthermore, the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method was employed to understand the influence of the IXIC-4Cl content on the electron (μe) and hole mobilities (μh) in the ternary devices. As our GISAXS results show an interesting trend in the intermixing domain size, we use the two binary devices and the 1:0.5:0.5 ternary device to discuss the influence of morphology on carrier mobility and charge transport balance. As shown in Fig. 6d and Table S3 (ESI†), the hole mobility in the ternary blends gradually increases with the increase of the IXIC-4Cl content, while the electron mobility increases first and then decreases from 1:1:0 to 1:0.5:0.5 then to 1:0:1. When the IXIC-4Cl content is 0.5, the electron mobility reaches a maximum, which can be mainly ascribed to the smallest intermixing phase for the optimal ternary blend film (GISAXS result). The smallest intermixing phase could lead to a purer acceptor phase(s), which is beneficial for electron transport and collection. The PM7:ITC-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl (1:0.5:0.5) blend film displays an electron mobility of 4.80 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a hole mobility of 7.08 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The ratio of μh/μe of the 1:0.5:0.5 blend is the closest to 1 among all the samples. Upon further adding the IXIC-4Cl into the ternary blends, despite the fact that the hole mobility increases, the electron mobility significantly drops due to the increased domain size, resulting in a less balanced μh/μe, which is detrimental for the overall charge collection and thus the FF, consistent with the device performance.
Conclusion
In conclusion, a series of ternary OSCs were fabricated using PM7:ITC-2Cl as the host system and an ultra-low bandgap acceptor of IXIC-4Cl as the third component. The PCE of the ternary OSCs reaches 15.37% by incorporating 50 wt% IXIC-4Cl in the acceptors, which is significantly higher than those of the binary counterparts based on ITC-2Cl (13.72%) and IXIC-4Cl (12.01%). The PM7:IXIC-4Cl-based device yields good photovoltaic performance despite a negligible ΔEHOMO(D–A). To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 15.37% is the highest value reported so far for ternary OSCs. Such an excellent PCE is mainly attributed to the increased JSC, which mainly arises from the broadening and complementary absorption. In addition, adding IXIC-4Cl into the PM7:ITC-2Cl binary system suppresses bimolecular recombination, improves charge dissociation and the collection efficiency, balances charge transport and reduces the intermixing domain size, which could also be responsible for the enhanced JSC. Noticeably, the optimized ternary device gave a PCE over 15% with a quite small Eloss of 0.42 eV, which are the best results for ternary OSCs. These results offer more insight into the deep role of ultra-low bandgap NFA as a third component in the device efficiency improvement of ternary OSCs.

Broader context
In the past decade, more and more attention has been paid to organic solar cells (OSCs) due to their advantages such as light weight, flexibility and low fabrication costs. The active layer of an organic solar cell is usually made up of an electron donor and an electron acceptor. The traditional electron acceptors, known as fullerene derivatives, suffer several drawbacks including poor absorption in the visible region, limited energy level variability, and high synthesis and purification costs. Fortunately, the recent emergence of nonfullerene acceptors overcomes these limitations and enables OSCs to move forward on a new journey. Thus, non-fullerene OSCs have developed rapidly in the last few years, including single-junction binary, ternary and multijunction (e.g., tandem) OSCs. Among them, ternary OSCs not only maintain the simplicity of the single-junction device architecture, but also offer many other advantages as discussed in the following. In this work, a series of ternary OSCs were fabricated with PM7:ITC-2Cl as the host system and an ultra-low bandgap acceptor of IXIC-4Cl as the third component. The optimal ternary device achieved an excellent PCE of 15.37% with a quite low energy loss of 0.42 eV, which are the best results for ternary OSCs to date.
