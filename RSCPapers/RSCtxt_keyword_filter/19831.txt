    , Accepted 10th December 2012First published on 13th December 2012AbstractThe randomly nanotextured back electrode provides a simple and efficient route for enhancing photocurrent in polymer solar cells (PSCs) by light trapping, which can increase light absorption within a finite thickness of the active layer. In this study, we incorporated mono-disperse 60 nm polystyrene nanoparticles (PS NPs) into a 50 nm thick poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) anode buffer layer (ABL) to create a randomly nanotextured back electrode with 10 nm height variations in inverted-type PSCs. The roughened interface between the PS NP-PEDOT:PSS ABL and the Ag electrode scatters light in the visible range, leading to efficient light trapping within the device and enhanced light absorption in the active layer. Inverted PSCs with randomly nanotextured electrodes (ϕNP = 0.31) showed short-circuit current density (JSC) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) values that were 15% higher than those of control devices with flat electrodes. External quantum efficiency, reflectance, and optical light scattering as a function of ϕNP were examined to determine the origin of the enhancement in JSC and PCE.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted a significant deal of attention due to their great promise in the realization of low-cost, printable, light-weight, flexible, and portable energy sources.1–6 In particular, the inverted-type device has received significant attention because of its air-stable and high work-function metal electrodes that serve as the back electrodes.7–10 However, weak absorption of the solar spectrum by the thin active layer of bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs can limit their power conversion efficiency (PCE). A thicker active layer alleviates this problem, but also leads to an increase in the series resistance of the device due to the limited charge-carrier mobility of the conjugated polymers. This ultimately reduces the fill factor (FF) and short circuit current density (JSC) of the devices.11–13
One promising approach for the improvement of light absorption without increasing the thickness of the photoactive layer is to trap light within the active layer and enhance its light absorption with a periodic or random texture at the back electrode of the devices.14–27 Specifically, periodic photonic nanostructures have been used for this purpose in previously published work.28–31 And the assembled structure of colloidal particles has been used for enhancing light trapping by light reflection in inorganic and dye-sensitized solar cells, because it is relatively easy to control their morphological and optical properties.32,33 However, the use of light-trapping strategies in PSCs has been thus far relatively limited. For example, light trapping approaches for PSCs have been limited to light reflectors using periodic structures with a length scale comparable to the light wavelength. However, such periodic grating structures can only be produced by expensive, top-down approaches such as nanolithography methods using patterned masks and electron beams.14,15,20 These approaches utilize destructive processing techniques that typically have adverse effects on the properties of the active layer and, in turn, on the performance of the PSCs. Thus, the development of a nondestructive, scalable, and low-cost route for producing a controlled nanostructure on the back electrode is essential to enhance light absorption and to optimize the PCE of the PSCs.
Herein, we demonstrate a simple and easy approach employing polymer nanoparticles to create a randomly nanostructured back electrode for efficient light trapping within the inverted PSCs. The nanostructure of the back electrode was produced via transfer of a controlled surface nanostructure in the polystyrene nanoparticle (PS NP) blended PEDOT:PSS anode buffer layer (ABL); therefore the approach is nondestructive and scalable. The mono-disperse PS NPs were designed with diameters of 60 nm comparable to the thickness of the ABL (∼50 nm), thus producing surface nanostructures with a controlled nanometer length scale without interfering with charge transport and PSC function. The resulting nanostructure in the ABL resulted in a negative pattern of the random nanostructuring on the Ag electrodes of efficient PSCs. For example, JSC and PCE values of inverted poly(3-hexylthiophene):o-xylenyl C60 bisadduct (P3HT:OXCBA) PSCs with randomly nanotextured electrodes (ϕNP = 0.31) were 11.57 mA cm−2 and 5.70%, representing 18% increases, compared to those with flat (ϕNP = 0) electrodes (Fig. 1).

The addition of PS NPs into the PEDOT:PSS ABL provides a simple and easy route for creating the nanotextured ABL/Ag back electrode interface, which allows efficient light trapping. 
The origin of the enhanced JSC and PCE in the inverted PSCs was the light trapping effect, which leads to a massive enhancement in light absorption and the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE).
Results and discussion
To produce a randomly nanostructured back electrode in PSCs, PS NPs were added to a PEDOT:PSS film deposited between an active layer and an Ag back electrode. Because PS NPs must be well dispersed and stabilized in an aqueous PEDOT:PSS solution, we designed and synthesized monodisperse PS NPs by emulsion polymerization in water with careful control of the reaction conditions (i.e., the concentration of the stabilizer).34 The diameter of the highly monodisperse PS NPs was measured to be 60 nm (Fig. S1 in the ESI†), approximately 10 nm larger than the 50 nm thick PEDOT:PSS film. Various amounts of the monodisperse PS NPs were added to an aqueous solution of PEDOT:PSS to produce PS NP-blended PEDOT:PSS (PS NP-PEDOT:PSS) films with different ϕNP values. Therefore, the surface morphology of the PS NP-PEDOT:PSS film was determined by (1) the difference between the PS NP size and the PEDOT:PSS film thickness and (2) the ϕNP values, resulting in back electrodes with controlled nanostructures.
To investigate the effect of PS NPs in the ABL on the performance of the devices, various inverted BHJ PSCs were fabricated with stack order ITO/ZnO/active layer/PS NP-PEDOT:PSS ABL/Ag and varied ϕNP between 0 and 0.51 in the PS NP-PEDOT:PSS ABL. For the active layer of the PSCs, P3HT was used as an electron donor, and OXCBA or phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) was used as an electron acceptor. Because fullerene bisadducts have a higher lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level than PCBM,35–41 P3HT:OXCBA-based inverted solar cells exhibit higher open-circuit voltages (VOC), resulting in higher PCE than that of P3HT:PCBM-based inverted PSCs.42 Each of the P3HT:OXCBA devices was prepared under the same conditions, including the P3HT:OXCBA blend ratio (1.0:0.6, w/w) and the solution concentration. Thermal annealing was applied to optimize the performance of the devices. The PS NP-PEDOT:PSS ABLs with various ϕNP values were then spun onto the active layers, and the samples were thermally annealed at 120 °C for 10 min to remove water. Finally, the Ag back electrode (100 nm) was deposited via thermal evaporation. Fig. 2 shows the J–V curves of the inverted (a) P3HT:OXCBA and (b) P3HT:PCBM PSCs with different ϕNP values under AM 1.5 illumination at 100 mW cm−2. Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the BHJ PSCs.

The control device of pure PEDOT:PSS ABL (ϕNP = 0) exhibited a PCE of 4.83% (VOC = 0.82 V; JSC = 9.29 mA cm−2; and FF = 0.64), consistent with previously reported values.42 As ϕNP increased, the PSC performance improved dramatically, with PCEs increasing to over 5%. Notably, when ϕNP = 0.31, the PCE of the inverted type P3HT:OXCBA device was 5.70% (VOC = 0.85 V; JSC = 11.57 mA cm−2; FF = 0.58), which showed an enhancement of 18% in PCE compared to that of the control device. Improvement in JSC (i.e., ϕNP = 0, JSC = 9.29 mA cm−2; ϕNP = 0.31, JSC = 11.57 mA cm−2) made a major contribution to the increase in the PCE. Finally, as ϕNP further increased to 0.42, the PCE of the PSC device decreased to 5.12% (VOC = 0.84 V; JSC = 10.71 mA cm−2; FF = 0.57), but the value was still higher than that of the control device (ϕNP = 0). To further confirm the trend of photovoltaic performance as a function of the ϕNP values, we also fabricated inverted P3HT:PCBM-based PSCs (ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM/PS NP-PEDOT:PSS ABL/Ag) with different ϕNP values. Fig. 2(b) and Table 1(b) show the characteristics of these inverted P3HT:PCBM PSCs with different ϕNP values. When the ϕNP value increased to 0.31, the P3HT:PCBM device exhibited a PCE of 3.91%, a 10% enhancement over the control device (ϕNP = 0, PCE = 3.55%).
Therefore, it is shown that the addition of PS NPs induced an increase in JSC and, in turn, the PCE. The photovoltaic performance trend observed in the P3HT:PCBM system as a function of ϕNP was in excellent agreement with that observed in the P3HT:OXCBA system. The enhancement in both PSCs employing different active material systems suggests that our scheme can be adapted to general thin-film photovoltaic cells, rather than limited to special types of devices.
To gain insights into the enhancement of PCE in the inverted type PSCs with PS NP-PEDOT:PSS ABLs, the morphology of the PS NP-PEDOT:PSS/Ag back electrode was characterized by cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements in terms of ϕNP. First, the cross-sectional TEM images in Fig. 3 show the layered structure of the ITO/ZnO/P3HT:OXCBA/PS NP-PEDOT:PSS ABL/Ag electrode within inverted PSC devices with different ϕNP values of (a) 0, (b) 0.24, and (c) 0.42.
 Fig. 3  Cross-sectional TEM images of inverted PSCs with various ϕNP values. The images show the layered structure in the device, ITO/ZnO/active layer (P3HT:OXCBA)/PS NP-PEDOT:PSS ABL/Ag electrode; (a) ϕNP = 0, (b) ϕNP = 0.24, and (c) ϕNP = 0.42. The scale bar is 100 nm. 
The cross-sectional TEM samples were prepared directly from the PSC devices by a focused ion beam (FIB) technique. In the control device (ϕNP = 0), the PEDOT:PSS ABL layer with a smooth interface was shown to be sandwiched between the Ag electrode and the P3HT:OXCBA active layer. In contrast, as the ϕNP value increased, the interface between the PS NP-PEDOT:PSS layer and the Ag anode became significantly rougher. For example, Fig. 3(b) shows that, at ϕNP = 0.24, a nanostructured Ag anode was produced with a peak-to-valley height (d1) of approximately 10 nm: the length scale was comparable to the difference between the size of the PS NPs (60 nm) and the thickness of the pristine PEDOT:PSS film (∼50 nm). As the ϕNP value increased further to 0.42, the average peak-to-peak distance between the nanostructures of the Ag back electrode (d2) decreased, but d1 remained similar, at 10 nm. Thus, it is expected that the d2 value and the corresponding frequency of the nanostructure in the Ag electrode can be tuned as a function of ϕNP. It was reported that for a periodic grating approach, in addition to the amplitude of the grating, the distance between the gratings is also an important parameter that affects the degree of light scattering and the performance of the device.43 While the cross-sectional TEM images clearly reveal the presence of a nanostructured Ag electrode with a d1 value of ∼10 nm, the d2 values as a function of ϕNP could not be estimated precisely because the TEM images tend to reflect the projection through the 100 to 120 nm thickness of the microtomed slices, only showing the blurred interface.
To evaluate the change in the nanostructure of the Ag back electrode precisely as a function of ϕNP, the surface morphologies of PS NP-PEDOT:PSS ABLs were characterized by SEM and AFM. The SEM images in Fig. S2† show that the PS NPs were distributed randomly in the PS NP-PEDOT:PSS layer and that the d2 value decreased with the increase in ϕNP values. From the AFM analysis (Fig. S3†), the root-mean-square (RMS) values of surface roughness on the PS NP-PEDOT:PSS films were obtained as 12.4, 12.0 and 10.2 nm for ϕNP = 0.24, 0.31 and 0.42, respectively, which produced estimates of d1 values at different ϕNP values. In contrast, the RMS surface roughness of the planar back electrode was only 0.7 nm. These results show excellent agreement with those from the cross-sectional TEM images in Fig. 3. This difference in the nanostructure of the Ag back electrode can be explained by the existence of the protruding PS NPs in the PS NP-PEDOT:PSS layer. Furthermore, these different degrees of surface texturing as a function of ϕNP values have the potential to alter the performance of inverted type PSCs because of the corresponding changes in the morphological structure of the back electrode and the resulting light trapping behavior.
In an effort to elucidate the relationship between the morphology of the back electrode and the PCE enhancement, EQE spectra and light scattering characteristics of the devices were examined. Fig. 4(a) shows that the EQEs were significantly improved with increasing ϕNP values. Massive enhancements were achieved compared to the control devices (ϕNP = 0) over a broad range of wavelengths for all of the nanostructured devices. The EQE enhancement peaked at ϕNP = 0.31, leading to the largest JSC and PCE, as demonstrated in Fig. 2. The measured JSC values for the four PSC devices were well matched with integrated values (ϕNP = 0, JSC,EQE = 9.03 mA cm−2; ϕNP = 0.24, JSC,EQE = 11.05 mA cm−2; ϕNP = 0.31, JSC,EQE = 11.29 mA cm−2; and ϕNP = 0.42, JSC,EQE = 10.76 mA cm−2) obtained from the EQE spectrum within an error of 3%. To better understand the light trapping effects of different morphologies of the back electrode, the optical properties were characterized at various ϕNP values. Fig. 4(b) shows the visual, optical signatures of light scattering with incident laser beams of various wavelengths of 405, 532, and 650 nm on the inverted P3HT:OXCBA PSCs. An inverted PSC with a flat back electrode (ϕNP = 0) showed entirely specular reflection. In contrast, devices with nanostructured back electrodes (ϕNP = 0.24, 0.31, and 0.42) indeed showed diffuse reflections due to the randomly nanotextured back electrode. The images in Fig. 4(b) clearly show the most diffused reflections for ϕNP = 0.31 at all three wavelengths of λ = 405, 532, and 650 nm, which provides clear qualitative evidence for the strongest light trapping for devices with ϕNP = 0.31. To investigate quantitative light scattering effects, reflectances of the flat (ϕNP = 0) and nanostructured (ϕNP = 0.31) devices were measured with and without an integrating sphere as shown in Fig. S4.† The reflectances with and without an integrating sphere showed large difference in the nanostructured device while they were almost the same in the flat (ϕNP = 0) device over the entire wavelength range (400–700 nm), indicating that the nanostructured back electrodes scattered incident light. The details are discussed in the ESI.† Since light was scattered to a greater extent by the nanostructured back electrodes, the optical path length per single pass in the active layer was increased through oblique propagation, allowing multiple bounces of the light caused by total internal reflection on top of the substrate or between the thin film layers. Effective light scattering thus provides more opportunity for incident photons to be absorbed in the active layer and therefore generates a larger photocurrent. Light scattering was observed in the devices with randomly nanostructured electrodes for all incident laser beams with various wavelengths and its tendency agreed with that of EQEs that showed the large enhancements over a broad wavelength range compared to the device with the flat electrode. Consequently, the PSC devices with nanostructured back electrodes induce increased photocurrents by more strongly absorbing incident light in a broad range of wavelengths, which results from an increase in the optical path length by efficient light trapping.

Conclusions
We reported a simple and efficient approach for using polymer NPs to create randomly nanotextured back electrodes that allow efficient light trapping in the inverted PSCs. The high performance light trapping of nanostructured Ag back electrodes has been demonstrated in two different inverted PSC systems, P3HT:OXCBA and P3HT:PCBM, resulting in significant enhancement in JSC without any deterioration of VOC or FF and thus leading to improvements in PCE. As a result, inverted P3HT:OXCBA PSCs with ϕNP = 0.31 exhibited a PCE of 5.70% with approximately 18% increases in both the JSC value and PCE, compared to those of flat, conventional inverted PSCs. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the highest PCEs reported to date for P3HT-based inverted PSCs with a basic architecture.42,44 The enhanced scattering effect induced by the nanostructured Ag back electrode was the main reason for the increased JSC and PCE; these increases were confirmed by EQE spectra and light scattering measurements. Our approach offers a nondestructive, scalable and potentially low-cost methodology to induce light trapping for highly efficient, inverted PSCs.
