    , Accepted 20th November 2018First published on 28th November 2018AbstractThe highly unusual state, 1(TT), is a coupled, double triplet state that has recently garnered significant attention. This multiexcitonic state can be formed by a quantum transition from a single-photon bright state in a variety of organic semiconducting materials. 1(TT)'s transient nature and similarity to independent triplets, however, has led to significant difficulties in characterization and prediction of its properties. Recent progress describing 1(TT) from theory and experiment are breaking through these difficulties, and have greatly advanced our comprehension of this state. Starting from the early description of 1(TT) in polyenes, this perspective discusses formation mechanisms, spectroscopic signatures, and the scope of intertriplet interactions. When employing singlet fission to generate charge carriers in a solar cell, 1(TT) has a central role. Due to the variety of coupling strengths between triplet states in 1(TT) amongst different chromophores, two different strategies are discussed to enable efficient charge carrier extraction. Continued growth in our understanding of 1(TT) may lead to control over complex quantum states for intriguing applications beyond high-efficiency, organic solar cells.
Introduction
Excited states involving more than one promoted electron have been known to physical chemists for half a century. For example, close examination of α,ω-diphenyl octatetraene spectra found three anomalies: unusually long intrinsic fluorescence lifetime, separation of absorption and emission origins, and varying solvent shifts in absorption and emission.1 To help explain these features, theoretical calculations reported the existence of an optically dark state (of Ag symmetry) below a bright π–π* transition (Bu).2 The dark state explained the unusual spectral observations, but additionally introduced the possibility for multielectron excited states to be present within single molecules, even bound within the same conjugated π system. These findings motivated study of a similar state in trans-butadiene as a characteristic model system for a putative two-electron excited state.2–4 In an exciton model, the 1(TT) character of the excited 1Ag state of trans-butadiene is described in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Exciton model of the 21Ag state of trans-butadiene. Six configurations (ψk) are obtained by the multiplication of one set of spatial orbitals (φi) and six different sets of spin components (σki). 
In this figure, the multielectron singlet state is composed of a superposition of six distinct configurations. This state is denoted as 1(TT), where each T represents a triplet state and the spin multiplicity is given in superscript. The exciton model contains electronic configurations ψ1 and ψ2 for T1T−1 and T−1T1, respectively, where the subscript indicates the total Sz component of each ethylene-like subunit. The ψ3 to ψ6 electronic configurations correspond to the various ways to form T0T0. This model clearly shows the contributions from two localized triplets on each ethylene subunit, and all configurations ψ1 to ψ6 are important to describe 1(TT). While the complete description of the 21Ag dark state in butadiene is of mixed 1(TT) and singly excited character, longer polyenes are thought to have even higher degrees of 1(TT) character.5 Regardless, in polyene-like molecules (including carotenoids6) strong coupling exists within the triplet pair due to spatial proximity, and the resulting singlet, triplet, and quintet S(TT) electronic states will be well-separated in energy (S = 1, 3, 5). Importantly, states with 1(TT) character can be photophysically relevant due to their energetic proximity to the optically allowed 1Bu state in molecules like the polyenes.7–12
States with 1(TT) character, however, need not exist within a single π system—as in intra-molecular cases. Early13,14 and recent investigations of singlet fission (SF) have focused on 1(TT) on molecular pairs in films or covalently linked dimers. In these cases, the assignment of the individual triplets is easily made to one distinct π system or the other, as localization of the π orbitals to molecular units is a more natural procedure15 than in the example shown in Fig. 1 (where the ethylene-like units are clearly strongly interacting).
In the typically invoked SF mechanism, a single photon is absorbed by a material, and a triplet pair emerges by transitioning to 1(TT) from the single-exciton bright state. The two triplets in 1(TT) have only relatively weak interactions in this inter-molecular situation, leading to the S(TT) states being close in energy (S = 1, 3, 5), with much smaller gaps than in intramolecular systems (Fig. 2). The degree of interaction between the π systems modulates this triplet–triplet coupling, and therefore has great importance to understanding the 1(TT) state and its behavior.

SF has gathered substantial interest16–22 in the weakly coupled 1(TT) form (spatially distinct triplets), largely due to its potential to generate multiple charge carriers per photon. In principle, a well-designed materials system involving a SF chromophore paired with a conventional chromophore could allow the 33% Shockley–Queisser23 limit on power conversion efficiency of solar cell to be increased up to 41%.24,25 This multiexciton generation process has been historically, and now conventionally, envisioned as S0S0 + hν → S0S1 → 1(TT) → T + T,26 where T + T designates independent, uncorrelated triplets. The separability of the 1(TT) state has therefore become a key point of great interest: in some cases, the two triplets may diffuse away from each other, but maintain long-lived quantum entanglement, a surprising effect that was not previously anticipated. Details of SF dynamics and related exciton transport are described in a recent perspective.27 These issues—centered on the 1(TT) state—are at the forefront of SF research, have important implications for SF's reverse process (triplet–triplet annihilation), and will be the focus of the present discussion.
SF has been observed and investigated in several chromophores: (hetero/functionalized)oligoacenes, quinoidal thiophene, aromatic diimide dimers, azaborine dimers, polyenes, and carotenoids.22 For the most weakly coupled SF chromophores such as bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl) [TIPS]–pentacene, and rubrene (top panel in Fig. 2), the two triplets in 1(TT) reside on two molecules, i.e. intermolecular SF (xSF). Strongly coupled 1(TT) states, however, tend to stay within a single π system in special cases such as the intramolecular SF (iSF) chromophore, quinoidal bithiophene (QOT2),28 the cofacial covalently linked tetracene dimer, BET-X29 (bottom panel in Fig. 2), carotenoids which have polyene-like backbone structures,30–32 semiconducting polymers,33 and conjugated donor–acceptor polymers taking advantage of charge transfer.34,35
For solar cell applications, the xSF and iSF materials have the same goal: to harvest as many electrons as possible and realize SF's potential solar power efficiency enhancement.24,36–42 Understanding the 1(TT) state is therefore key to achieving this goal, as we can envision three interesting cases for charge extraction, 1. Transfer from independent, individual triplets after separation of the entangled double triplet, 2. Transfer from spatially separated triplets in an entangled 1(TT) state, and 3. Transfer from a highly coupled, monomeric 1(TT) state. The difficulty in investigating this state partly comes from its transient lifetime and inaccessibility via conventional triplet sensitization. On the other hand, recent improvements in experimental tools and theoretical approaches that can detect and describe multiexciton states have significantly advanced our comprehension of 1(TT).
In this perspective, we describe the nature of the coupled triplet state in the context of SF. The recent successes in theory and experiment to characterize and describe 1(TT) are visited, and the formation mechanisms of this intermediate state are introduced. The spectroscopic signatures of 1(TT) and intertriplet interactions that result in bound 1(TT) are also discussed. Two different electron-harvest strategies targeting xSF and iSF are discussed, showing the potential for applications of 1(TT) in photovoltaics.
Identity and character
The earliest studies of SF are reviewed in detail elsewhere,16 so we herein focus on research occurring over the last 10 years. In this period, the first quantum chemical description of 1(TT) was made by Zimmerman, Zhang, and Musgrave on a pentacene dimer, employing accurate correlated ab initio methods.43 This study characterized the optically-forbidden multiexciton state, and pointed out that rapid population transfer from bright S1 downhill in energy to 1(TT) through a state crossing might explain ultrafast SF in pentacene. Though the 1(TT) intermediate was conjectured44 and demonstrated by simulation,43 direct optical observation of this state was not provided until 2015, where Stern and co-workers used transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) to identify excimers of TIPS–tetracene that possessed singlet and triplet character. The absorption of excimer includes the five characteristic absorption bands of triplet excitons with subtle differences that indicate interaction between triplet pairs. Additionally, via the rapid (∼80 ps) and concomitant formation of excimer with the decay of the singlet exciton, intersystem crossing was ruled out as a route for triplet formation. This evidence therefore led to assignment of the excimer as having 1(TT) character.45 These studies were key starting points in deciphering the properties of the intriguing 1(TT) state.
Formation mechanism
Recent theoretical and experimental efforts to understand the mechanism of SF have provided explanations for how two triplets can be generated from a single exciton on rapid timescales. The various proposed mechanisms for SF depend on the choice of model Hamiltonian, for instance direct two-electron coupling,46 the indirect two-step model incorporating a charge-transfer intermediate,47 the mediated (also known as superexchange) pathway involving a virtual charge transfer state,48–50 the coherent mechanism,51–53 and the vibronic coupling mechanism.43,53–61 To better understand the context of these models, we must first discuss what is meant by the common expression, “coupling”. When invoked without context, coupling often refers to diabatic coupling, where an electronic Hamiltonian is postulated in the basis of physically intuitive states. For example, the Hamiltonian may be constructed from the HOMO and LUMO of a pair of equivalent monomers, and may thus contain Frenkel excitons where one electron is excited locally on a monomer, charge transfer states where the electron configurations have unequal numbers of electrons on each monomer, and multi-exciton states with each of the two monomers in an excited state. From an electronic structure point of view, this is referred to as the diabatic representation. (Diabats are not a uniquely defined, but are basis states used to build adiabatic states, the latter are measurable.) The coupling between the postulated states is called diabatic coupling. This coupling is a measure of degree of interaction between the diabats, and therefore is related to the rate of transition between diabatic states. On the other hand, these same diabatic configurations are also basis states that may be combined to form uniquely defined eigenstates (adiabatic states) of the Hamiltonian via unitary transformation. The eigenstates, generally speaking, can be mixtures of basis states, and therefore interesting features like combinations S1 and 1(TT) character are possible. Diabatic and adiabatic views are each valid within their respective choice of model, but we’ll focus herein on the adiabatic picture as provides a unique choice for electronic state representations.
While mechanisms involving solely electronic interactions have been known for a long time,36,47,62,63 the importance of vibrational motion in SF has gained attention only in recent years. In the adiabatic picture, the non-adiabatic interaction between two states, I and J, is instead driven by the derivative coupling vector,  where ψx is the electronic wavefunction of state x and Ex is corresponding adiabatic energy. When considering dynamics in the adiabatic representation, the rate of transition from one state to another is proportional to , and nuclear motion (in R) is incredibly important (this expression is valid when nuclei are treated classically, and electronic states quantum mechanically). In addition, the derivative coupling vector is inversely proportional to the energy gap (EI − EJ). These factors show that nuclear motion that brings the two states of interest (e.g. S1 and 1(TT)) close together in energy will enact fast transitions between states (Fig. 3). This electronic–vibrational effect is known as vibronic coupling.
 Fig. 3  Schematic description of 1(TT) formation from S1via state crossing approached by vibrational motion. S1 and 1(TT) represent diabats, and green and red lines are for adiabatic energy curves. Derivative coupling is given as the blue curve. 
The specific role of nuclear motion in SF was first realized in ab initio quantum chemical simulations43,55,64 that showed intermonomer distance modulates the energy gap between S1 and 1(TT). In cases where S1 and 1(TT) are nearly degenerate, the large derivative couplings permit ultrafast formation of 1(TT) via vibronic effects.65
Ultrafast vibronic spectroscopy observed vibrational coherence between optically prepared S1 and dark 1(TT) states, and gave evidence for intersection-relevant dynamics in TIPS–pentacene dimers.54 The ab initio Frenkel–Davydov exciton model66–68 for excited-state properties of extended aggregates calculated the nonadiabatic coupling in tetracene unit cell, and identified four modes that could promote SF. These four modes have vibrational energies of 1400–1600 cm−1 which are able to couple S1 and 1(TT).57 While state crossings efficiently connect singlet excitons and doubly excited states in iSF chromophores and some pentacene derivatives,43,57,61,69 these crossings are less effective for systems with large energy gaps (and therefore weak derivative coupling) between S1 and 1(TT) states. Therefore, the success of vibronic coupling in explaining the SF mechanism in some chromophores does not rule out other mechanisms for other chromophores. For example, the roles of other configurations such as singlet excitons and charge transfer configurations need to be considered. It is well accepted that singlet exciton tends to reside over several chromophores,64,70–72 and this delocalization promotes 1(TT) formation, resulting in increased SF efficiency.54,73 When relatively low-energy charge transfer states are available, the complete mechanism may well pass through these states. In sum, SF mechanisms should be examined on a case-by-case basis for a complete picture.
Spectroscopic signature
Much attention has been paid to identify excited state absorptions (ESAs) in the electronic spectra from the 1(TT) state for various SF chromophores.39,40,44,74–78 From intermolecular and other weakly coupled SF chromophores, the overall spectral shape of 1(TT) and T + T are qualitatively similar, with differences induced by electronic coupling between triplets.79 These triplet pairs therefore should have spectra similar to that of individual triplets, making discrimination difficult.80 These issues have led to inspection of other spectral regions such as near-infrared (NIR) to find unique 1(TT)-related peaks among other excitons. Even though a characteristic peak of 1(TT) is not solely present in NIR, there are several successes. For example, covalently linked pentacene dimers were reported to have 1(TT) ESA in the NIR region, around 1.0 eV.76 The extended Pariser–Parr–Pople (PPP) Hamiltonian predicts additional weak absorption of 1(TT), distinct from free triplets in the NIR region.81 The transient absorption kinetic analysis of the acene family in the 800–1100 nm region showed the presence of three different species (free singlet/triplet excitons and 1(TT)), allowing isolation of the 1(TT) spectrum among the optically allowed singlet and free triplet excitons.40 NIR transient absorption spectra of pentacene derivatives revealed the presence of another coupled triplet state, 1(T⋯T) representing a noninteracting triplet pair.74,82 The lack of triplet–triplet interaction results in recovery of vibronic structure at ∼900 nm and loss of absorption in the long wavelength region (1200–1400 nm).74
In a case of iSF, Goodson and co-workers investigated the possibility of SF in QOT2.28 Various spectroscopies indicated the presence of an excited state populated at fast timescales after absorption, and the observed microsecond lifetime led to the suggestion that it may have triplet character. Subsequent electronic structure simulations by our research group, however, showed that triplet separation is not feasible in QOT2. This implied that the ESA occurs due to 1(TT) rather than free triplet states, in a close analogy to the 21Ag state of the polyenes (Fig. 4). These simulations also showed two feasible ESAs from 1(TT) that match the probe wavelength.83 While this provided reasonable evidence for iSF, a stronger criterion involves showing that two charge carriers can be extracted from the proposed intramolecular 1(TT) state. Another exemplary class of iSF chromophore is a conjugated donor–acceptor copolymer.34,35 Karan et al. investigated the ground and excited state absorption spectra of one donor–acceptor copolymer using the PPP Hamiltonian. This study revealed the origins of two allowed absorption peaks below the Frenkel π–π* transition: a singlet state with CT character, and a weakly absorbing 1(TT) state. The 1(TT) state was shown to acquire nonzero oscillator strength by mixing with nearby states, which increases with the strength of donor–acceptor interaction in the polymer.
 Fig. 4  The chemical structure of QOT2. The polyene-like backbone is highlighted in red. 
Recently, we computed the absorption spectra of the singly and doubly ionized QOT2 in order to illustrate the electronic structure of electron transfer (ET) products of 1(TT).84 While double ionization nearly does not alter the absorption energy in the NIR, the oscillator strength becomes twice that of neutral 1(TT). Single electron detachment blue-shifts the lowest-energy transition by about 0.1 eV. These distinct spectral features of ionized 1(TT) were used to estimate the ET yield from single-photon excited QOT2.84
Besides the QOT2 iSF case, theoretical investigations are generally quite useful to identify and assign the transition character of the ESAs from 1(TT), especially since spectral overlap between singlet, triplet, and 1(TT) excitons makes band assignment nontrivial. For example, electronic structure studies with the PPP Hamiltonian showed that there is a unique ESA peak in the NIR region (700–900 nm) for 1(TT) in pentacene derivatives that is absent in the free triplet.81,85 Recent studies inspired by the vibronic coupling hypothesis investigated the optical transition of 1(TT) into higher-lying double triplet states.86 Reasonable comparisons can be made with two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy data56 when the second excited 1(TT) state from the PPP simulations is included in the model.81
Vibrational techniques have also been utilized to provide new chemical insights into the SF mechanism as well as the nature of 1(TT).56,87–89 Interest in the mid-infrared (Mid-IR) region in particular can be motivated by crowded nature of the visible region, providing a wider spectrum for excited state and dynamics analysis. Mid-IR spectroscopy was demonstrated to explain the evolution of 1(TT), relaxation processes during triplet exciton separation, and triplet–triplet annihilation after separation. These studies were performed by tracking the vibrational frequency of specific bonds87–89 (e.g. the alkyne stretch at 2130 cm−1, the only active peak in its region).
Emission from the optically dark 1(TT) is another useful, observable spectroscopic signature, despite the fact that the one-photon transition is symmetry forbidden.29,40,75,90 This could be understood by the Herzberg–Teller mechanism, where vibronic coupling between dark 1(TT) and bright S1 induces symmetry breaking, and allowing 1(TT) to be emit by borrowing intensity from the allowed transition (Fig. 5). Intriguingly, this mixing of states results in observable oscillations in the delayed fluorescence of time-resolved photoluminescence experiments.91–93 These signals emerge when populated triplet pair states evolve, diffuse, and recombine to form an emissive singlet state via triplet fusion. Quantum phases acquired during triplet pair state formation can lead to constructive and destructive interference at the triplet fusion step, ultimately producing quantum beats in the fluorescence signal. The characteristic frequencies in delayed fluorescence can be considered not only as the direct evidence for 1(TT) formation, but also indications that the superposition of triplet states (Fig. 1) remains coherent as the triplets spatially diffuse. The timescale of this entanglement was observed well into the nanosecond range,94 a surprising result that suggests that 1(TT) states may have utility in spintronic devices and quantum computers, well outside the originally intended applications to SF.
 Fig. 5  Intensity borrowing from bright state (S1) allows dark state 1(TT) emission. 
Intertriplet interaction
As demonstrated by many experiments, 1(TT) spectra are not identical to independent triplet spectra, and this suggests that these two cases are not energetically identical either. Interestingly, the electronic and spin interactions have been reported to form a bound state (Fig. 6),40,53,58,76,94–98 where the separated triplets are higher in energy than the spatially proximate pair. The magnitude of intertriplet binding (ΔEb) is quantified as ΔEb = E[T + T] − E[1(TT)].95 As depicted in Fig. 6, ΔEb depends strongly on the coupling/interaction between triplets. For weakly interacting triplet pairs, 1(TT) and 5(TT) are energetically nearly degenerate and only a small activation energy is required to spatially separate the triplets. In the context of SF, a temperature dependence of triplet separation is found even in pentacene derivatives where SF is overall exoergic.40 This indicates that intertriplet binding is nonnegligible even in the weakly coupled case. Strong coupling induces sizeable stabilization in 1(TT), which makes a clear separation between 1(TT) and 5(TT), but no obvious route for triplet separation. Accurate determination of the 1(TT) energy can thus provide improved estimates of 1(TT) formation rate75 compared to the conventional approach of taking the singlet–triplet energy difference for ΔESF.99 These observations indicate the presence of a bound triplet pair before separation into free triplets (T + T), and it is instrumental to have accurate energetics including this intermediate state to improve the description of SF kinetics.
 Fig. 6  Schematic energy diagram illustrating SF including excited singlet exciton (S1), 1(TT), and free triplet (T + T) states. Shaded area is used to show possible energy levels of each state. Conventional singlet–triplet energy difference (ΔESF) and intertriplet interaction energy (ΔEb) are described for iSF and xSF. Blue and gold arrows give examples of the upper and lower limits for these characteristic energies. 
It is of great importance and interest to accurately estimate intertriplet interaction energies, preferably from simulation. These predictions, however, are not easy to accurately estimate due to complex multiexcitonic nature of the 1(TT) state. Approaches like time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) and configuration interaction singles (CIS) cannot handle doubly excited states like 1(TT). Equation-of-motion coupled cluster (EOM-CC) methods can include multiple electron promotions, but the widely used EOM-CCSD does not provide accurate energies for 1(TT) states due to the lack of higher order excitations. Instead, the available electronic structure tools that can handle doubly excited states are active space methods. Among the various active space theories, restricted active space with double spin-flip (RAS-2SF)100 has been successfully applied to investigate 1(TT) in a number of studies.29,50,55,64,95,101–107 Complete active space second order perturbation theory (CASPT2) computations have also seen use.40,83 Our opinion is that none of these simulations has reached the accuracy required (better than 100 meV) for fully ab initio prediction of the 1(TT) binding energy, and further investigations with improved descriptions of electron correlation are strongly encouraged.
While the ΔEb of xSF chromophores is usually relatively small (<0.1 eV), strongly coupled iSF materials exhibit much stronger intertriplet interaction. For example, XMS-CASPT2 estimated ΔEb of QOT2 to be 430 meV, which is much stronger than that of xSF acene derivatives. Such strong interaction might explain the inefficient generation of independent triplets in this molecule. One can consider QOT2 as a polyene with substitutions83 (Fig. 4), where TT binding is relatively weak in the latter case. This apparent contradiction can be understood by noting the π-backbone torsion—which lowers ΔEb30—is not possible in the structurally rigid QOT2. Another interesting comparison of binding energies is tetracene and covalently linked tetracene dimers. An energy of only 0.02 eV is required to separate 1(TT) in tetracene dimer, but a covalently tetracene dimer linked with benzene increases ΔEb up to 0.23 eV.29,104 Similarly, in the structurally overlapping tetracene pair of BET-X, ΔEb is estimated to be 0.48 eV.29,104 Strong coupling induces large stabilization in 1(TT) and increases the values of ΔEb, hindering independent triplet formation in trapped excimer states. The degree of charge transfer could also be correlated with ΔEb, as one first-principles study on donor–acceptor polymers found that strong push–pull strength decreases the 1(TT) binding energy.108
The spatial distribution of 1(TT) excitons in xSF chromophores will also relate to the intertriplet interaction. The localized 1(TT) on a proximate dimer is explained by short-range Coulomb integrals between S1 and 1(TT).16,17,114,115 The weak magnetic dipolar interaction of 0.008 GHz in tetracene, however, might suggest a more delocalized nature of 1(TT),116 and a recent transient absorption microscopy study explained the high mobility of 1(TT) via exciton delocalization.117 These results, together with mid-IR spectra that imply the presence of spatially separated triplet pair 1(T⋯T),87,88 indicate the need for an extended model for 1(TT) beyond the dimer. This delocalized nature of 1(TT) is due to its mixing with nearby electronic states (see Formation mechanism section), a phenomenon that is explainable by the adiabatic state model.
Even though most of these intertriplet interaction studies have focused on electronic energies, the role of entropy is also important to describe the thermodynamics of SF. For example, efficient SF in crystalline tetracene can be explained through entropic gains,52 where the entropy change is found by counting the number of configurations in each electronic state, S1, 1(TT), and T + T. A subsequent theoretical study employing a three-state model analyzed the role of entropy in tetracene, pentacene, and hexacene.95 The study found that 1(TT) formation and triplet dissociation steps increase entropy.80,109,110 In determining the entropic contributions, care must be taken as to how morphology affects the (de)localization of excitons, which has significant effect on SF dynamics.96,106,111–113 In our opinion, the role of entropy in SF deserves further attention.
The lifetime of 1(TT) has often been conceived to be relatively short due to the weak interaction between the two triplets. There are, however, recent experimental measurements and theoretical predictions that 1(TT) can be long-lived.76,97,118 Its lifetime can reach hundreds of picoseconds in directly linked bipentacenes,60 a few to hundreds nanoseconds in covalently linked bipentacenes with one/two phenylene spacers79,89 or boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) derivatives in organic solvents,61 and even up to the μs regime in TIPS–tetracene film at very low temperature (10 K).97 These observations are in line with the non-negligible binding energy of two triplets in the 1(TT) state discussed above.
Before discussing the applications in photovoltaics, we emphasize that 1(TT) states are not exclusively composed of multiexcitonic configurations. More precisely, due to energetic proximity and mixing in eigenstates, there exist nonzero contributions in 1(TT) from localized singly excited states, charge resonance states, triplet coupling states, and states with higher spin multiplicity.50,60,83,94,97,103,119–121 In general, the contribution of 1(TT) is dominant over other configurations, and therefore 1(TT) can represent a (mostly) multiexcitonic state. Recent electronic structure simulations including many basis states, however, show their sizable contributions to 1(TT),60,103 further giving evidence that this fascinating electronic state is more complex than usually imagined.
Application in photovoltaics
One sought-after goal for SF is to fully harvest the two excited electrons for solar cell applications. To achieve this, xSF and iSF chromophores may be linked to two strategies:122 two sequential single ETs (1ETs) and one concerted two-ET (2ET). For the case of xSF, the first electron might be transferred from an independent triplet (route (i) in Fig. 7), or even directly from 1(TT) (route (ii) in Fig. 7). This leaves an ionized chromophore, and the second ET would occur from another independent triplet (T) or ionized (TD)+ (where D is a doublet), where the electron transfers from the neutral chromophore. In contrast to the two-step sequential ETs, two electrons could be transferred simultaneously from 1(TT) in the iSF case, taking full advantage the coherence of the two triplets (route (iii) in Fig. 7).
 Fig. 7  Possible electron transfer sequences from the 1(TT) state. Generally, these will compete with electron transfer from single-exciton states as well. 
Several studies have reported improved power conversion efficiency by using SF chromophores.18,36–38,40,76,122–126 The first suggestion of multi-ET from 1(TT) was reported at a pentacene–fullerene interface.51 A kinetic model suggests that ET from pentacene 1(TT) to C60 occurs in 400 fs, whereas ET from a single triplet occurs on a longer timescale. A follow-up study compared the ET efficiency of two SF donors, pentacene and tetracene.37 Results of that work suggested that fast conversion of S1 excitons to 1(TT) state is necessary to achieve greater degrees of multi-ET by reducing the loss of singlet excitons. Yong et al. reported a photon-to-charge quantum yield of 120% in bulk-heterojunction films of functionalized heteroacene and fullerene derivatives.40 Charge per photon ratio remained nearly constant with increased population ratio of free triplet over 1(TT), implying concerted 2ET from 1(TT) may be a dominant pathway.
Recent computational studies on non-fullerene electron acceptors suggest anthraquinones (AQs) could be a promising multi-electron acceptor.127–129 Following this, ET from the 1(TT) state of the iSF donor QOT2 to AQ in solution was reported by our group.84 AQ proved to be effective in accepting electrons from the entangled TT excitons with estimates of 92% internal quantum efficiency and 2ET being favored over 1ET by ∼7:3 ratio.
In a related strategy, triplet energy transfer has been employed to enhance SF photovoltaics device performance.123,125,130,131 This pathway avoids triplet dissociation into electrons and holes, which could cause significant energy losses.18 Triplets generated from SF process can be transferred to inorganic nanocrystals via the Dexter mechanism in pentacene/PbSe130 and tetracene/PbS.123 The pentacene/PbSe system can harvest up to 1.9 triplets for every photon absorbed in pentacene in <1 ps. A more recent study reported the triplet transfer in SF chromophores anchored to PbS quantum dots.131 The detailed SF mechanism, 1(TT) formation and separation, and morphology effects in this system are ripe for further investigation. Compared to bilayer systems, the model system consisting of three layers (SF chromophore, donor, and acceptor) was suggested to minimize singlet exciton transfer by avoiding direct contact of SF material and acceptor.125
Based on this brief survey of recent photovoltaic achievements, some criteria for chromophore candidates that might exhibit efficient multi-ET from 1(TT) are suggested: (i) rapid population transfer to 1(TT) to prevent single ET from S1, (ii) strong intertriplet interaction to maintain 1(TT), (iii) rigid chromophores to minimize unwanted nonradiative decay, and (iv) possibilities for functionalization to tune electro- and photo-chemical activities.
Summary
Coupled double triplet states have proven mysterious and fascinating since their discovery as dark states in the polyenes in the 1970s.1 Recently, 1(TT) has been noted as a central intermediate in the SF process, and even been shown to have a lifetime that is much longer than anyone expected. This observation suggests that 1(TT)-like states may see use in new areas, for instance as coherent states for quantum computing devices. We look forward to seeing new, unconventional applications of 1(TT) beyond pushes to increase solar cell efficiency.
The demonstration of non-zero binding energies of 1(TT) in xSF systems and the relatively large binding energies in iSF chromophores should lead to improved ways to harness the power of the double-exciton state. For example, our recent suggestion that multiple electrons might be directly extracted from 1(TT) might be a highly useful strategy in solar cells,84 compared to standard methods to extract one charge carrier at a time. Significant molecular design challenges, however, must be overcome to fully realize such possibilities, as the design of iSF chromophores with single, strongly coupled π systems has not yet been accomplished.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Exciton model of the 21Ag state of trans-butadiene. Six configurations (ψk) are obtained by the multiplication of one set of spatial orbitals (φi) and six different sets of spin components (σki).	 

 	Fig. 2  Fragment and canonical orbital representations, molecular orbital energies, double triplet energies, and relevant materials for weakly (top) and strongly (bottom) coupled SF chromophores.	 

 		 

 	Fig. 3  Schematic description of 1(TT) formation from S1via state crossing approached by vibrational motion. S1 and 1(TT) represent diabats, and green and red lines are for adiabatic energy curves. Derivative coupling is given as the blue curve.	 

 	Fig. 4  The chemical structure of QOT2. The polyene-like backbone is highlighted in red.	 

 	Fig. 5  Intensity borrowing from bright state (S1) allows dark state 1(TT) emission.	 

 	Fig. 6  Schematic energy diagram illustrating SF including excited singlet exciton (S1), 1(TT), and free triplet (T + T) states. Shaded area is used to show possible energy levels of each state. Conventional singlet–triplet energy difference (ΔESF) and intertriplet interaction energy (ΔEb) are described for iSF and xSF. Blue and gold arrows give examples of the upper and lower limits for these characteristic energies.	 

 	Fig. 7  Possible electron transfer sequences from the 1(TT) state. Generally, these will compete with electron transfer from single-exciton states as well.
