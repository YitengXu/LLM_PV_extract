    , Accepted 29th January 2021First published on 30th January 2021AbstractFerroelectrics are appealing candidates for photovoltaic applications. In this study, Bi5FeTi3O15 (BFTO) single layer and ZnO/BFTO bilayer films were deposited onto 0.7 wt% Nb-doped SrTiO3 (NSTO) electrically conducting single-crystal substrates to form Ag/BFTO/NSTO and Ag/ZnO/BFTO/NSTO photovoltaic devices. It was found that the insertion of an n-type semiconducting ZnO layer eliminates the built-in electric field between the Ag electrode and the BFTO film and results in the formation of a BFTO/ZnO p–n junction with a built-in electric field whose direction points to the BFTO film. These effects, together with the depolarization field within the BFTO film, provide a favorable energy level alignment for efficient electron extraction. As a result, the short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) was improved by nearly 50 fold to 2.2 mA cm−2 and the output power density was increased by 15 fold to 0.09 mW cm−2 under ultraviolet light (λ = 405 nm) illumination. Upon the reversal of the ferroelectric polarization direction from downward to upward, the Jsc and the open circuit voltage (Voc) were increased by 2.5 and 4 fold for the Ag/BFTO/NSTO device and by 2.83 and 8.5 fold for the Ag/ZnO/BFTO/NSTO device, respectively. This work provides an effective way for developing efficient ferroelectric and semiconductor based photovoltaic devices.
Introduction
Ferroelectric thin films are attractive due to their wide applications in nonvolatile memories, radio frequency and microwave devices, piezoelectric actuators, pyroelectric infrared sensors and micro-electro-mechanical systems.1 In recent years, perovskite ferroelectrics have drawn increasing attention because of their potential applications in solar energy conversion devices. The photovoltaic effect is one of the most important approaches to harvest solar energy, in which the sunlight could be directly converted to electricity.2–5 Ferroelectrics are appealing candidates for photovoltaic applications because one can control the injection barriers and internal electric fields which are the cores of the photovoltaic effect.6 The photovoltaic effect in ferroelectrics was found as early as the 1950s,3 however, renewed attention of low-bandgap ferroelectrics suitable for photovoltaic effect applications has been received since 2009.7 In traditional, for semiconducting p–n junctions the main shortcoming is that they cannot produce open circuit voltage (Voc) exceeding the bandgap of the component materials, which leads to low efficiency. In contrast, photogenerated carriers in ferroelectrics are spontaneously separated due to their inversion symmetry breaking.8 Therefore, the ferroelectric photovoltaic (FPV) effect could produce a large Voc above the bandgap of the materials2,9–11 and show ferroelectrically switchable photovoltaic outputs.12–18 As of now, the FPV effects have been reported in several perovskite ferroelectric oxides, including BiFeO3,8,9,12,18–22 Pb(Zr,Ti)O3,2,4,23 BaTiO324,25 and LiNbO3.26,27 However, the photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) is still too low to meet practical applications. Much effort has been devoted to overcoming this problem. It is known that there are usually two back-to-back built-in electric fields of Schottky barriers at the interfaces of electrode/ferroelectric/electrode devices, which hinders the transport of photogenerated carriers to the external circuits.2 A feasible approach to solve this problem is to reduce or remove one of the Schottky barriers, which has been achieved by inserting a semiconductor layer between the ferroelectric layer and the electrode layer. The inserted semiconductor layer could form an ohmic contact with the electrode layer on the one hand and form an electric field at the ferroelectric–semiconductor interface on the other hand. This electric field has the same direction as the built-in electric field, favoring the enhancement of the PCE.2,4,5,28 Therefore, the combination of ferroelectric materials with semiconductors could take advantage of advantages from both materials.5 It was reported that the insertion of a Cu2O layer between Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT) and Pt in the ITO/PZT/Pt device leads to a 120-fold enhancement in short-circuit photocurrent.4,29 The n-type ZnO semiconductor with high electron mobility, strong photoresponse and easy crystallization was reported to be an excellent semiconductor candidate to improve PCE.2,5,28
Bi5FeTi3O15 (BFTO) is one of the members of the Aurivillius structure family. It is an environmentally friendly lead-free multiferroic material with four layers of perovskite units of (Bi3FeTi3O12)2− sandwiched by two (Bi2O2)2+ layers along the c axis.3,11,30 In recent years, a few groups have reported that BFTO films show potential in photovoltaic applications.11,13,31 However, Jsc is still limited to the magnitude of μA cm−2. In this paper, we grew high quality highly c-axis oriented BFTO epitaxial films on conducting 0.7 wt% Nb-doped SrTiO3 (NSTO) single-crystal substrates using the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique and studied the photovoltaic effects of the Ag/BFTO/NSTO devices. Furthermore, we inserted an n-type semiconductor ZnO layer (∼100 nm) between the BFTO layer and the top Ag electrode to form Ag/ZnO/BFTO/NSTO devices to eliminate the Schottky barrier, thereby significantly increasing the output power density (Pout) by 1500%. The ferroelectric polarization-modulated photovoltaic effect of the devices with and without the ZnO layer was investigated systematically.
Results and discussion
XRD θ–2θ scans were performed to characterize the phase purity and out-of-plane orientation of the BFTO/NSTO and ZnO/BFTO/NSTO structures. As shown in Fig. 1a, the (00l) (l = 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and 24) diffraction peaks of the BFTO film and the (002) diffraction peak of the ZnO film, as well as the (00l) (l = 1 and 2) diffraction peaks of the NSTO substrate, appear, indicating the successful growth of single phase and highly c-axis oriented BFTO and ZnO films. As displayed in Fig. 1b and c, XRD rocking curves taken on the BFTO(0010) and ZnO(002) diffraction peak have a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.1° and 1.4°, respectively, revealing the excellent crystalline quality of the BFTO film and relatively good crystalline quality of the ZnO film. For the ZnO/BFTO/NSTO structure, XRD ϕ scans were carried out on the ZnO(101), BFTO(110) and NSTO(110) diffraction peaks to establish the in-plane epitaxial relationships among the BFTO, ZnO, and NSTO. The results are shown in Fig. 1d. Four diffraction peaks 90° apart from each other, corresponding to the four-fold lattice symmetry, were observed for the BFTO film and NSTO substrate, respectively, which implies good epitaxial growth of the BFTO film on the NSTO substrate and the in-plane epitaxial relationship could be written as [100]BFTO//[100]NSTO and [010]BFTO//[010]NSTO.

It is known that the ZnO has a six-fold lattice symmetry around the c axis. However, there are 24 diffraction peaks for the ZnO film (upper panel of Fig. 1d). We infer that the ZnO film adopts an in-plane textured growth mode on the BFTO film, namely, the c-axis-oriented ZnO unit cells have four in-plane lattice arrangements on the BFTO(001) plane, corresponding to a rotation of in-plane unit cells by 15°, 30°, and 45°, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1e. This textured growth mode would lead to four sets of six-fold diffraction peaks of the ZnO film, resulting in twenty-four diffraction peaks. Fig. 1f shows that the thickness of the BFTO and ZnO films is ∼200 and ∼100 nm, respectively. HRTEM images reveal an ordered structure of the ZnO and BFTO films with the c-axis perpendicular to the substrate plane and show clear lattice fringes with the lattice spacing indicated in Fig. 1g and h. A two-dimensional AFM topographic image of a BFTO film grown on a NSTO substrate is given in Fig. 1i, where the film has a dense morphology with a spiral growth pattern and a flat surface with a root-mean-square roughness (RMS) of about 1.6 nm.

Fig. 2a shows the out-of-plane box-in-box PFM image for the BFTO film. The domains with an opposite polarization direction within the brown and yellow boxes can be observed from the color contrasting areas after poling using a tip bias of ±10 V, verifying local ferroelectricity and electrically writable properties of the BFTO film. Moreover, the ∼180° phase change in Fig. 2b suggests a full polarization switching by scanning the tip bias, demonstrating good ferroelectric switching properties of the BFTO film. The macroscopic ferroelectric hysteresis loops of the Ag/ZnO/BFTO/NSTO can be seen in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The remanent polarization Pr is about 22 μC cm−2 and the coercive field EC is about 369 kV cm−1. Therefore, a dc bias voltage of −10 V (+10 V) applied on the top of Ag electrode is enough to completely switch the ferroelectric domain of the BFTO film.

Fig. 3a shows the optical transmission as a function of wavelength for the ZnO and BFTO films. Both of them have relatively low transmittance in the UV region and relatively high transparency in the visible region. For the BFTO films, there is a large absorption tail in the visible region, which is due to the oxygen and Bi vacancies.32 The XPS results provide evidence that there are oxygen and Bi vacancies in BFTO films. Fig. 3c shows four fitted subpeaks: two subpeaks located at 159.2 and 164.5 eV are ascribed to Bi(4f7/2)–O and Bi(4f5/2)–O bonds, respectively, while the other two subpeaks located at 157.2 and 162.5 eV are related to Bi vacancies.33 The spectrum in Fig. 3d can be fitted into two peaks located at 529.4 and 531.27 eV, respectively, which is consistent with the lattice oxygen and the oxygen vacancies, respectively.34 Moreover, the XPS peaks (see Fig. S2, ESI†) at 458.3 and 466.3 eV correspond to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of Ti4+ ions. The binding energy at 464.1 eV correspond to Ti3+. The suggested oxygen vacancies promot the formation of Ti3+ ions by donating electrons to Ti4+ ions.

In particular, the ZnO film possesses high transmission at 405 nm. It has been reported that both the ZnO and BFTO films belong to direct bandgap semiconductors.11,31 The optical bandgaps (Eg) of the BFTO and ZnO films are estimated to be 3.08 and 3.26 eV (corresponding to the wavelength of ∼403 and 380 nm), respectively, from the (αhν)2vs. hν curve (Fig. 3b), by extrapolating the linear portion of the curve to the X-axis, where the absorption coefficient becomes zero. The obtained bandgap of the BFTO film is comparable with that reported in the literature (Eg = 3.01 eV).11 It is expected that the BFTO layer can absorb a significant number of photons under UV illumination and result in photovoltaic responses. Therefore, we chose a UV illumination source with λ = 405 nm, which is closer to the optical bandgap of the BFTO (λ = 403 nm) in order to obtain a significant photovoltaic effect.
The photovoltaic responses of the FPV devices with and without the ZnO layer were characterized by measuring the J–V characteristics in the dark and under UV light illumination, respectively. Typical J–V curves are shown in Fig. 4a and b, from which one may find Voc = 0 V and Jsc = 0 in the dark for both the Ag/BFTO/NSTO and Ag/ZnO/BFTO/NSTO devices where the BFTO is in the as-prepared state. Nevertheless, under UV light illumination, the Ag/BFTO/NSTO device exhibits significant photovoltaic responses with Jsc = 0.045 mA cm−2 and Voc = 0.46 V. After the insertion of a ZnO layer, the J–V characteristics of the Ag/ZnO/BFTO/NSTO device shows ohmic behavior and Jsc was enhanced by approximately 49-fold under UV light illumination (Fig. 4b), as compared with that of the Ag/BFTO/NSTO device (Fig. 4a). Compared with those of the Ag/BFTO/NSTO structure, the Voc for the Ag/ZnO/BFTO/NSTO device decreases from 0.46 to 0.15 V upon UV light illumination, however, Pout increases from 0.006 to 0.09 mW cm−2, resulting in an increase of Pout by 15 times. Thus, the insertion of the ZnO layer between the Ag electrode and the BFTO layer plays a great role in improving Pout in the Ag/ZnO/BFTO/NSTO device. Furthermore, both the Ag/BFTO/NSTO and Ag/ZnO/BFTO/NSTO devices were periodically exposed to UV light illumination under zero bias (over a total time of 210 s with 30 s light on/off intervals), respectively. As displayed in Fig. 4c and d, both Jsc and Voc of the Ag/BFTO/NSTO and Ag/ZnO/BFTO/NSTO devices increase dramatically when exposed to UV light illumination and finally reach a saturation value, display quick, stable and repeatable responses for 3 cycles with light ON and OFF. The Pout of the Ag/ZnO/BFTO/NSTO device is apparently larger than that of the Ag/BFTO/NSTO device, indicating that the insertion of the ZnO layer has a stable and durable effect on improving the photovoltaic performance of the Ag/BFTO/NSTO devices.
 Fig. 4  (a) and (b) show the J–V curves of the Ag/BFTO/NSTO and Ag/ZnO/BFTO/NSTO devices in the dark and under 405 nm UV light illumination, respectively. The BFTO films were in the unpoled virgin state. (c) and (d) show the time-dependent Jsc and Voc curves of Ag/BFTO/NSTO and Ag/ZnO/BFTO/NSTO devices in the dark and under 405 nm UV light illumination, respectively. 
To demonstrate the effects of ferroelectric polarization on the photovoltaic effect, the J–V curves of the Ag/BFTO/NSTO and Ag/ZnO/BFTO/NSTO devices were measured under UV light illumination before and after the BFTO films were poled upward and downward, respectively. Here, the upward (downward) poling is defined as applying a dc bias voltage of −10 V (+10 V) on the top of the Ag electrode with a pulse width of 10 s. Switchable photovoltaic behaviors are illustrated in Fig. 5a and b.
 Fig. 5  (a) and (b) show the J–V curves for the Ag/BFTO/NSTO and Ag/ZnO/BFTO/NSTO devices before and after polarization switching under constant UV light illumination. (c) and (d) show the transient photoresponse for the Ag/ZnO/BFTO/NSTO devices before and after polarization switching measured under periodic UV light illumination and zero bias. 
In Fig. 5a, the photocurrent and photovoltage of the Ag/BFTO/NSTO devices show appreciable changes with the polarization direction of the BFTO film poled upward or downward, as compared with those of the unpoled one. For the unpoled state, the Jsc and Voc values are 0.045 mA cm−2 and 0.46 V, respectively. After the BFTO film is poled downward, the Jsc and Voc decrease to 0.04 mA cm−2 and 0.11 V, respectively. Furthermore, upon the switching of the polarization direction from downward to upward, Jsc and Voc increase from 0.04 to 0.1 mA cm−2 and 0.11 to 0.44 V, corresponding to an increase of Jsc and Voc by 175% and 300%, respectively. These results demonstrate that the photovoltaic effects of the device could be adjusted by modifying the polarization state of the BFTO film. Upon polarization direction switching, the ferroelectric domain state of the BFTO film was modified (Fig. 2a), resulting in a reversal of the direction of the built-in electric field inside the BFTO film and thus changes in Jsc and Voc.
For the BFTO-unpoled Ag/ZnO/BFTO/NSTO device, Jsc = 2.2 mA cm−2 and Voc = 0.15 V were obtained under UV light illumination. Upon downward polarization, Jsc and Voc are tuned to 1.2 mA cm−2 and 0.02 V, respectively, corresponding to the tunability of Jsc and Voc by ∼45.5% and ∼86.7%, respectively. By switching the polarization direction from downward to upward, Jsc and Voc are enhanced to 3.4 mA cm−2 and 0.17 V, corresponding to the tunability of Jsc and Voc by ∼183% and ∼750%, respectively. The significant polarization-switching-induced modification of Jsc and Voc is distinctly demonstrated in Fig. 5c and d, respectively, where Jsc and Voc are measured as a function of time by switching the UV light ON/OFF for different polarization states. It can be found that the photocurrent increases distinctly due to the insertion of the ZnO layer into the Ag/BFTO/NFTO structure for the three different polarization states. Moreover, the effects of polarization switching on the modulation of Jsc and Voc for the Ag/ZnO/BFTO/NSTO device (Fig. 5b) are greater than those for the Ag/BFTO/NSTO device (Fig. 5a), demonstrating that the ZnO layer plays a significant role in the polarization-switching-induced-modulation of Jsc and Voc. It is believed that the ZnO layer plays two roles. First, the Schottky barrier between the Ag layer and the BFTO layer is greatly suppressed after the insertion of the ZnO layer. Second, the ZnO thin film is under strain due to the large lattice mismatch between BFTO and ZnO (BFTO: 5.4698 × 5.4389 × 41.197 Å, α = β = γ = 90°; ZnO: 3.2487 × 3.2487 × 5.2055 Å, α = β = 90°, γ = 120°). In this case, the ZnO layer can exhibit strain-induced polarization, thereby generating an additional internal field Ein-ZnO in the ZnO layer.2,5,35 Both factors are beneficial to the transport of the photogenerated carriers.
To understand the nature of the interface contact between the ZnO layer and the BFTO layer more clearly, we determined the energy levels of the ZnO and BFTO layers using an inelastic secondary electron cutoff of ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) energy distribution curve, in our case, the He I discharges at hν = 21.21 eV.

Fig. 6a shows the UPS data of the 200 nm-BFTO layer and 100 nm-ZnO layer, respectively. The work function (φ = VO − EF, VO is the vacuum energy level and EF is the Fermi level) of the BFTO and ZnO layers could be derived from the low kinetic energy cut-offs in the secondary emission features. The maximum energy EVB of the valence band (VB) with respect to EF is obtained by extrapolating the linear portion of the low binding energy side of the proper VB peak to the energy axis,4 as illustrated in Fig. 6a. Note that the Fermi levels of the BFTO and ZnO surfaces are considered independently. The measured φ for the BFTO and ZnO is 4.86 (21.21 − 16.35 eV) and 4.6 eV (21.21 − 16.61 eV), respectively. It is noted that after the deposition of the ZnO layer on the BFTO layer, a vacuum level shift of 0.26 eV appears. The energy difference between the EF and EVB for the ZnO is 2.78 eV, as shown in Fig. 6b.

(c) Schematic energy diagram of interfacial layers of ZnO/BFTO deduced from the UPS data. A favorable energy level alignment for the electron moving from BFTO to ZnO layer forms. 
On the basis of the above analysis, the schematic energy diagram for the BFTO and ZnO layers could be obtained and is illustrated in Fig. 6c. It is noted that ECB for the BFTO is 1.18 eV larger than that of the ZnO while EVB is 1.36 eV smaller. As a result, there forms a p–n heterojunction with a built-in electric field Ebi-3 whose direction points from the ZnO to the BFTO. If the direction of the depolarization field of BFTO (Edp-BFTO) also points to NSTO, as shown in Fig. 7, an optimal alignment of internal fields could be achieved in the Ag/ZnO/BFTO/NSTO device to improve the photovoltaic effect.5

Considering the Schottky barrier at the NSTO/BFTO interface and the ohmic contact at the ZnO/Ag interface, the device structures and working principles are schematically illustrated in Fig. 7. Fig. 7a shows the schematic diagram of carrier transport in the Ag/BFTO/NSTO device. Here, NSTO is an n-type semiconductor electrode,36 and the work functions of NSTO and Ag are 4.237 and 4.26 eV, respectively. Therefore, two built-in electric fields Ebi-1 and Ebi-2 with opposite directions are formed, where the former is slightly larger than the latter, which inhibits the transport of photogenerated charge carriers. There is also a depolarization field (Edp-BFTO) in the BFTO film, and the initial ferroelectric polarization in the BFTO film is due to the self-polarization effect.1,5 Therefore, the direction of the depolarization field is against the polarization direction and can be reversed by changing the polarization direction. Upon UV light illumination, carriers were produced, separated and transported to the external circuit under the net internal electric field (Enet). It should be noted that the direction of the photocurrent cannot be reversed in all devices (for unpoled, poled downward or poled upward), which implies that the Enet has the same direction for the three polarization states. For the unpoled Ag/BFTO/NSTO device, as shown in Fig. 7a, the net built-in electric field is Enet(unpoled) = Ebi-2 + Edp-BFTO − Ebi-1. When an electric field is applied to the BFTO layer, the ferroelectric domain state of the BFTO film would be modified, resulting in changes in the magnitude and/or direction of Edp-BFTO. Thus, different photovoltaic responses occur upon the switching of the polarization direction. After the BFTO film is poled downward (Pr-down), as shown in Fig. 7b, the polarization of the BFTO points to the NSTO, and the negative polarization charges aggregate at the BFTO–NSTO interface, attracting holes in the NSTO to the interface region. As a result, the width of the depletion layer (WD) decreases, leading to an increase in Ebi-1. The net built-in electric field is Enet(down) = Ebi-2 − Edp-BFTO − Ebi-1, which is apparently smaller than Enet(unpoled), resulting in a decrease of Jsc and Voc from 0.045 to 0.04 mA cm−2 and 0.46 to 0.11 V, respectively. In contrast, for Pr-up (Fig. 7c), the positive polarization charges at the NSTO/BFTO interface attract electrons in the NSTO to the interface region. Consequently, WD increases, resulting in a decrease in Ebi-1. The Enet(up) = Ebi-2 + Edp-BFTO − Ebi-1, therefore, both Jsc and Voc increase significantly upon the polarization switching from Pr-down to Pr-up (see Table 1).

In the present work, the ZnO layer was inserted between the BFTO thin film and the Ag electrode to improve the PCE, as illustrated in the schematic diagram of the carrier transport mechanism for the Ag/ZnO/BFTO/NSTO device in Fig. 7d. The work function of Ag (4.26 eV) is smaller than that of ZnO (4.6 eV). In this way, an ideal Ohmic-type contact at the Ag/ZnO interface is achieved. As aforementioned, at the same time, Ebi-2 is eliminated due to the insertion of the ZnO layer. Moreover, a built-in electric field Ein-ZnO is generated in the ZnO layer due to strain-induced polarization,2,5,35 whose direction is the same as that of Edp-BFTO. These alignments of Ein-ZnO and Edp-BFTO further enhance the separation and transport of photogenerated carriers. Furthermore, Bi element easily volatilizes during the thin film preparation process. The existence of Bi vacancies, as confirmed by XPS results (Fig. 3c), is expected to result in p-type BFTO thin films.16,38 The contact of the p-type BFTO and the n-type ZnO would form a p–n junction, producing an additional built-in electric field Ebi-3, whose direction is also the same as that of Edp-BFTO and Ein-ZnO. Therefore, after the insertion of the ZnO layer, the directions of the built-in electric fields in the Ag/ZnO/BFTO/NSTO become consistent, which is greatly beneficial to the separation and transport of photogenerated carriers. Furthermore, there are also photo-induced carriers generated in the ZnO layer under the irradiation of the UV light, which is also beneficial for the enhancement of the photovoltaic response.2 For these reasons, the photovoltaic J–V curves of the Ag/ZnO/BFTO/NSTO device are different from those of the Ag/BFTO/NSTO devices (Table 1).

After the insertion of a semiconducting ZnO layer, the Ag/ZnO/BFTO/NSTO exhibits significant improvement in Jsc. It can be found that there is a slight decrease in Voc after the insertion of the ZnO layer, which may be attributed to the presence of ZnO-induced microstructural defects. Meanwhile, Ebi-2 is favorably eliminated, Ein-ZnO and Ebi-3 are in the same directions as Edp-BFTO appears, as aforementioned. In this case, Enet(unpoled)/ZnO = Ein-ZnO + Ebi-3 + Edp-BFTO − Ebi-1 (Fig. 7d), resulting in an apparent increase in Jsc, compared with that of the as-grown Ag/BFTO/NSTO device.
According to the ferroelectric field effect,39 after the BFTO film is poled downward (Pr-down), as shown in Fig. 7e, the polarization direction points to the NSTO and negative polarization charges aggregate at the BFTO–NSTO interface, attracting holes in the NSTO to the interface region. As a result, WD decreases, leading to an increase in Ebi-1. In contrast, the positive polarization charges at the ZnO/BFTO interface attract electrons in the ZnO to the interface region. Consequently, Wd increases, resulting in a decrease in Ebi-3. The direction of Edp-BFTO is reversed, compared with the unpoled BFTO device (Fig. 7d). In this case, as displayed in Fig. 7e, Enet(down)/ZnO = Ein-ZnO + Ebi-3 − Edp-BFTO − Ebi-1, which is significantly smaller than the Enet(unpoled)/ZnO, resulting in a decrease of Jsc and Voc from 2.2 to 1.2 mA cm−2 and 0.15 to 0.02 V, respectively. In contrast, for Pr-up (Fig. 7f), on one hand, the positive polarization charges at the NSTO/BFTO interface attract electrons in the NSTO to the interface region. Consequently, WD increases, resulting in a decrease in Ebi-1. On the other hand, negative polarization charges aggregate at the BFTO/ZnO interface, attracting holes in the ZnO to the interface region. As a result, Wd decreases, leading to an increase in Ebi-3. As a result, Enet(up)/ZnO = Ein-ZnO + Ebi-3 + Edp-BFTO − Ebi-1, resulting in a significant increase in both Jsc and Voc, compared with those for Pr-down (Fig. 7e). Compared to other photovoltaic properties based on Bi5FeTi3O15 thin films reported recently, the Jsc in our work is significantly higher (see Table 2).
Conclusions
In summary, we report the effects of ferroelectric polarization switching on the photovoltaic effects of Ag/BFTO/NSTO and Ag/ZnO/BFTO/NSTO devices. Through systematical measurements, it was found that upon the insertion of a ZnO layer between the Ag electrode and the BFTO film, the short current density (Jsc) was improved by nearly 50-fold from 0.045 to 2.2 mA cm−2 and the output power density was enhanced by 15 times from 0.006 to 0.09 mW cm−2. Band alignment analysis shows that the insertion of a ZnO layer not only eliminates the built-in electric field (Ebi-2) at the interface between the BFTO and Ag electrode, but also results in the formation of a BFTO/ZnO p–n heterojunction with a built-in electric field Ebi-3. These two facts, together with the strain-induced polarization in ZnO, are beneficial for the separation and transport of photogenerated carriers, thereby improving the photovoltaic effect. In addition, a distinct polarization-switching-modulated photovoltaic effect was achieved via the redistribution of the built-in electric fields inside the heterostructure. Our results may provide an opportunity for developing ferroelectric and semiconductor-based photovoltaic devices.
Experimental
Materials and preparation
The BFTO and ZnO/BFTO films were deposited on (001)-oriented one-side polished NSTO single-crystal substrates by PLD. The laser energy density and repetition rate were 2 J cm−2 and 1–4 Hz, respectively. The size of the NSTO single-crystal substrate is 5 mm × 5 mm × 0.5 mm. BFTO films were deposited at a substrate temperature (TS) of 750 °C under 30 Pa oxygen pressure, which was followed by in situ annealing for 30 min to improve the crystallization quality. Then, TS was reduced to 550 °C at 5 °C min−1, followed by the deposition of the ZnO film under 5 Pa oxygen pressure and in situ annealing for 30 min. Finally, the films were cooled to room temperature at 5 °C min−1. To investigate the photovoltaic and ferroelectric properties, ∼15 nm thick Ag top electrodes with a diameter of ∼0.2 mm were deposited on the BFTO and ZnO/BFTO films, respectively.
Structural, surface morphology and photovoltaic characterization
The crystallographic properties of the BFTO and ZnO/BFTO films were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) θ–2θ, ω, and ϕ-scans, respectively, using a high-resolution Bruker D8 Discover X-ray diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα1 radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Selected area electron diffraction patterns (SAED) and cross-sectional high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were measured by using a Tecnai G2F20S-Twin transmission electron microscope. The surface morphology of the BFTO and ZnO/BFTO films and the local ferroelectric properties of BFTO films were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), respectively, using a Dimension V (VEECO) scanning probe microscope. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the BFTO and ZnO/BFTO films in the dark and under light illumination were measured using a Keithley-2400 source meter. A diode laser with a wavelength of 405 nm (hv = 3.06 eV) and light intensity of 200 mW cm−2 was used to illuminate the devices. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) data were collected from a modified Physical Electronics photoemission system (Kratos Axis Utra Dld) which was incorporated into a custom-built ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) with a base pressure of 10−10 mbar. A SPECS UVS 10/35 He lamp at 21.21 eV was used as the UPS source. All measurements were performed at room temperature. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted on a Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi. All binding energies were calibrated with respect to the C 1s spectral line at 284.6 eV.
