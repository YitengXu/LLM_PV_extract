    , Accepted 25th February 2021First published on 25th February 2021AbstractSemitransparent organic solar cells (OSCs) were fabricated with a broad bandgap polymer D18-Cl as the donor (D), narrow bandgap small molecule Y6-1O as the acceptor (A) and ultra-narrow bandgap material Y6 as the third component. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.92% can be obtained from opaque OSCs with D18-Cl:Y6-1O (1.1:1.6, wt/wt or 0.7:1.6, wt/wt) as active layers, which is due to the dependence of the three well-balanced photovoltaic parameters on D18-Cl content in the active layer. It should be highlighted that the average visible transmittance (AVT) of blend films can be markedly enhanced from 30.3% to 47.3% with decrease in D:A from 1.1:1.6 to 0.7:1.6 (wt/wt), which is highly conducive to the preparation of semitransparent OSCs. Keeping the D:A as constant (0.7:1.6, wt/wt), 16.05% PCE is achieved in opaque ternary OSCs with D18-Cl:Y6-1O:Y6 (0.7:0.8:0.8, wt/wt) as the active layers, resulting from the slightly increased JSC of 23.21 mA cm−2 and FF of 76.74%. The AVT of the corresponding ternary blend films is also improved to 50.1%. Semitransparent ternary OSCs are fabricated with Au (1 nm)/Ag (20 nm, 15 nm, 10 nm) replacing 100 nm Ag as the electrode. A PCE of 13.02%, an AVT of 20.2% and light utilization efficiency of 2.63% are obtained from the semitransparent OSCs with Au (1 nm)/Ag (10 nm) as the electrode. This work indicates that adjusting D:A weight ratio and employing a ternary strategy should have great potential in simultaneously improving the PCE and AVT of semitransparent OSCs, especially using a wide bandgap polymer as the donor.
Introduction
Recently, approaching 18% power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) has been reported with efficient narrow bandgap materials as the active layers,1–5 especially for ternary OSCs with two well-compatible non-fullerene acceptors.6–9 The efficient narrow bandgap materials provide great potential for preparing semitransparent OSCs by sufficiently utilizing near infrared light.10–14 It is known that the luminous flux of solar light in near infrared light is much larger than that in visible light, leading to the relatively large short-circuit-current-density (JSC) of OSCs based on two narrow bandgap donor:acceptor (D:A).15–18 The ordered arrangement of the long main chain of polymer is conducive to the formation of efficient hole transport networks in D:A active layers; the efficient hole transport networks should be well kept in D:A blend films with low polymer content. Although low polymer content will result in more photon loss in the short wavelength range, the fill factor (FF) of OSCs may be markedly increased due to the efficient electron transport channels formed by the presence of more acceptors in active layers. A successful case has been reported by Zhang's group,19 the FFs of PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F based OSCs are markedly increased from 60.37% to 69.44% with decrease in the weight ratios of D:A from 1.5:1.5 to 0.8:1.5 (wt/wt). The gradually increasing FFs of OSCs have been commonly reported along with polymer content decrease in different active layers.20,21 The strategy of decreasing polymer content may provide plenty of room for preparing semitransparent OSCs with the simultaneously optimized PCE and average visible transmittance (AVT), especially for preparing efficient OSCs with one broad bandgap polymer and one narrow bandgap small molecule acceptor as active layers. The photon utilization efficiency in the visible light range can be optimized by altering the polymer content to achieve a trade-off between the PCE and AVT of the corresponding semitransparent OSCs. The typical progress in semitransparent OSCs is summarized in Table S1.† Meanwhile, the ternary strategy has been commonly demonstrated as an efficient method to further improve the PCE of OSCs, especially employing an ultra-narrow bandgap material as the third component.
In this work, the broad bandgap polymer D18-Cl, narrow bandgap material Y6-1O and the narrower bandgap material Y6 were elaborately selected for fabricating semitransparent OSCs. The chemical structures, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels, as well as the normalized absorption spectra of the used active layer materials are exhibited in Fig. 1. The weight ratios of D18-Cl:Y6-1O were finely adjusted from 1.1:1.6 to 0.1:1.6 for achieving efficient opaque OSCs with high FF, as well as large AVT (370–740 nm) of the corresponding blend films. It should be highlighted that the AVT of D18-Cl:Y6-1O blend films is markedly increased from 30.3% to 47.3% with decrease of the D18-Cl content from 1.1:1.6 to 0.7:1.6 (wt/wt); the corresponding opaque OSCs exhibit an increased FF from 72.14% to 75.86%, also retaining the same PCE of 14.92%. Based on the well optimized opaque binary OSCs, the narrower bandgap material Y6 was selected as the third component to prepare ternary OSCs keeping the D:A ratios (0.7:1.6, wt/wt) constant. A PCE of 16.05% is achieved in ternary OSCs with D18-Cl:Y6-1O:Y6 (0.7:0.8:0.8, wt/wt) as the active layers, along with the simultaneously increased JSC of 23.21 mA cm−2 and FF of 76.74%. It should be highlighted that an AVT of 50.1% for the optimal ternary blend film is much larger than that of 47.3% for the optimal binary blend film. The semitransparent ternary OSCs were fabricated with Au (1 nm)/Ag (20, 15, 10 nm) replacing 100 nm Ag as semitransparent electrodes. The PCE and AVT values of the semitransparent ternary OSCs can be adjusted from 15.47% to 13.02% and from 8.3% to 20.2% with decrease of Ag layer thickness from 20 to 10 nm. Over 75% FFs can be obtained in all semitransparent ternary OSCs, which should be due to the excellent conductivity of the semitransparent electrodes.22–25 The work may provide a new perspective for achieving efficient semitransparent OSCs by adjusting the D:A ratio and employing the ternary strategy, especially using a broad bandgap polymer as the donor and an ultra-narrow bandgap material as the third component.

Results and discussion
A series of opaque OSCs were fabricated with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/D18-Cl:Y6-1O (0.1–1.1:1.6, wt/wt)/PDIN/Ag, the thickness of the Ag layer was 100 nm. The current-density versus voltage (J–V) curves of OSCs were investigated under simulated AM 1.5G solar light illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2, as shown in Fig. 2a. The detailed photovoltaic parameters of opaque OSCs are summarized in Table 1. It is apparent that the photovoltaic parameters of opaque OSCs strongly depend on the D18-Cl content, mainly resulting from the optimized phase separation for charge separation and transport, as well as photon harvesting loss in the visible light range. The open circuit voltage (VOC) values of opaque OSCs slightly increased from 0.919 V to 0.929 V and then decreased to 0.900 V with decrease in D18-Cl content. A similar phenomenon was already reported by Hou et al. in PIDTDTQx:PC70BM based OSCs, which is primarily attributed to the decreased LUMO-level of aggregated acceptors and variable phase separation in active layers.26 The JSCs of opaque OSCs slightly increased with decrease in D18-Cl:Y6-1O weight ratio from 1.1:1.6 to 0.9:1.6 due to the well optimized phase separation, which can be confirmed from the enhanced FFs of the corresponding OSCs. Markedly decreased JSCs of opaque OSCs can be observed with decrease in D18-Cl content, originating from the low photon harvesting in the visible light range by D18-Cl. The FFs of opaque OSCs increased from 72.14% to 75.86% and then decreased to 54.91% with decrease in D18-Cl content, which strongly depends on the charge transport balance in active layers. The series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) of opaque OSCs were calculated according to the corresponding J–V curves, as listed in Table 1. It is apparent that Rs values decreased and then increased with decrease in D18-Cl content, and Rsh values exhibit an opposite variation trend. The opaque OSCs display the highest FF with D18-Cl:Y6-1O (0.7:1.6, wt:wt) as active layers, which can be well supported by the minimal Rs and maximal Rsh.27,28 It should be highlighted that FFs of all opaque OSCs can be maintained over 70% for the D18-Cl:Y6-1O ratios varying from 1.1:1.6 to 0.3:1.6 (wt/wt) because of the efficient and well balanced charge transport in the active layers. A PCE of 15.80% is achieved in the opaque OSCs with D18-Cl:Y6-1O (0.9:1.6, wt/wt) as active layers, benefiting from the well balanced photovoltaic parameters with a VOC of 0.928 V, JSC of 22.75 mA cm−2 and FF of 74.86%. The transmittance spectra of blend films with varied D18-Cl content are exhibited in Fig. S1,† and the corresponding AVTs of blend films are listed in Table 1; the detailed calculation procedure is described in the ESI.† It should be highlighted that opaque OSCs with D18-Cl:Y6-1O (1.1:1.6 or 0.7:1.6, wt/wt) as the active layer exhibit the same PCE of 14.92%, resulting from the good trade-off among the decreased JSC, and the increased VOC and FF. The decreased JSC of opaque OSCs with low D18-Cl content is due to the greater photon loss under visible light; meanwhile, the increased FFs of the opaque OSCs should be attributed to the more balanced hole and electron transport in the active layers. The AVT of blend films increased from 30.3% to 47.3% with decrease in D:A ratios from 1.1:1.6 to 0.7:1.6 (wt/wt), which should be conducive to the preparation of efficient semitransparent OSCs with low D18-Cl content, while keeping the PCE constant and improving the AVT of OSCs.

The EQE spectra of opaque OSCs were measured and are shown in Fig. 2b. Obviously, EQE values of opaque OSCs distinctly decreased with D18-Cl content less than 0.9:1.6 (wt/wt) in active layers, which is due to the loss of photon harvesting by D18-Cl and insufficient charge separation resulting from the enlarged Y6-1O domain size. It should be highlighted that the EQE values are slightly increased from 460 nm to 630 nm in opaque OSCs with D18-Cl:Y6-1O (0.9:1.6, wt/wt) as active layers compared with those of opaque OSCs with D18-Cl:Y6-1O (1.1:1.6, wt/wt) as active layers, indicating that exciton utilization efficiency can be improved by adjusting D18-Cl content. A similar phenomenon is also clearly observed from the EQE spectra of opaque OSCs with D18-Cl:Y6-1O weight ratios of 0.9:1.6 or 0.7:1.6 in the wavelength longer than 740 nm or 760 nm range, respectively. The phase separation of active layers can be finely optimized by altering the D18-Cl content to improve exciton utilization (charge separation and transport) efficiency, which provides great potential for developing efficient semitransparent OSCs with less polymer donor content.
To further investigate the influence of D18-Cl content on the charge separation of blend films, photoluminescence (PL) spectra of neat D18-Cl, Y6-1O and blend films were measured, as shown in Fig. 3a. Both neat D18-Cl and Y6-1O films show strong PL emission with the emission peak at 610 nm and 840 nm, respectively. It is apparent that the PL emission intensity of D18-Cl in blend films gradually decreased with decrease of its content, indicating the availability of a more adequate D/A interface for charge separation. This phenomenon can be confirmed from the distinctly quenched PL emission of D18-Cl in blend films. Meanwhile, the PL emission intensity of Y6-1O gradually increased with decrease in D18-Cl content, resulting from the enlarged Y6-1O domain size in blend films. More excitons on Y6-1O cannot arrive at the D/A interface for charge separation,29 leading to Y6-1O PL emission intensity enhancement in blend films with low D18-Cl content. It is known that the phase separation degree also influences charge transport in the active layers.30–32 The single-charge devices were prepared with distinct D18-Cl:Y6-1O weight ratios as active layers to investigate the charge mobility dependence on D18-Cl content. The ln(Jd3/V2) − (V/d)0.5 curves of the single-charge devices are shown in Fig. S2.† The hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) in blend films with distinct D18-Cl content are depicted in Fig. 3b. It is apparent that the gradually decreased μh and increased μe can be obtained in blend films with decrease in D18-Cl content; a more balanced μh/μe of 1.07 is achieved in the device with D18-Cl:Y6-1O (0.7:1.6, wt/wt) as the active layer, which can be further confirmed from the highest FF of 75.86% of the corresponding opaque OSCs.33–35 The detailed μh and μe values are summarized in Table S2.† The photocurrent-density (Jph) versus effective-voltage (Veff) curves of the opaque OSCs were investigated to gain deep insight into the effect of D18-Cl content on charge separation and collection, as shown in Fig. S3.† The detailed calculation procedure is described in the ESI.† The charge separation efficiency of opaque OSCs monotonously decreased with decrease in D18-Cl content due to the availability of less D18-Cl:Y6-1O interface; the detailed values are listed in Table S3.† The charge collection efficiency slightly increased and then decreased with decrease in D18-Cl content, indicating that efficient bi-continuous charge transport networks will deteriorate due to the discontinuity of D18-Cl networks in active layers with the rather low D18-Cl content.

Grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was carried out to explore the influence of D18-Cl content on molecular arrangement in active layers. The 2D GIWAXS patterns of neat D18-Cl, Y6-1O films and their blend films are shown in Fig. S4.† The out-of-plane (OOP) and in-plane (IP) line-cut profiles are extracted from the corresponding 2D GIWAXS patterns. Fig. 4a displays the OOP and IP profiles of neat films, as well as the inset of the corresponding 2D GIWAXS patterns of neat films. The obvious OOP (010) diffraction peak at 1.63 Å−1, IP (100) and (200) diffraction peaks at 0.31 and 0.55 Å−1 can be observed from the GIWAXS profile of neat D18-Cl film, indicating excellent face-on molecular arrangement in the neat film. The OOP (010) diffraction peak at 1.73 Å−1, IP (100) and (200) diffraction peaks at 0.28 and 0.41 Å−1 can also be observed from the GIWAXS profile of neat Y6-1O film, suggesting that Y6-1O prefers to form face-on molecular arrangement in the neat film. The OOP and IP profiles of blend films are exhibited in Fig. 4b. The ordered face-one molecular arrangement of D18-Cl deteriorates due to the absence of the OOP (010) diffraction peak at 1.63 Å−1, which well accords with the decreased μh in blend films with low D18-Cl content. The OOP (010) diffraction peak, IP (100) and (200) diffraction peaks of Y6-1O can be obviously observed in the blend films, indicating that the face-on molecular arrangement of Y6-1O can be well maintained in the blend films. Meanwhile, the IP (200) diffraction intensity of Y6-1O gradually increased with decrease in D18-Cl content, indicating the more ordered molecular arrangement of Y6-1O in blend films with low D18-Cl content. The more ordered face-on molecular arrangement of Y6-1O is conducive to charge transport,36,37 which can be well confirmed by the enhanced μe in blend films with low D18-Cl content. The influence of D18-Cl content on the phase separation of active layers was further investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as shown in Fig. S5.† As seen from the TEM images of blend films, the phase separation degree can be markedly adjusted by controlling the D18-Cl content; the domain size of Y6-1O gradually increased with decrease in D18-Cl content, which well accords with the experimental results on PL emission intensity, charge mobility and molecular arrangement of blend films.

As is known, the ternary strategy has been confirmed as an efficient and simple method to improve the performance of OSCs.38–41 In this work, the more narrower bandgap material Y6 was selected as the third component; good compatibility between Y6-1O and Y6 should be achieved to form the alloyed state due to their similar chemical structure.42 A series of opaque ternary OSCs were prepared with D18-Cl:Y6-1O:Y6 as active layers with distinct Y6 content. The J–V curves and EQE spectra of all the opaque OSCs were measured and are shown in Fig. S6.† It is apparent that JSCs of opaque ternary OSCs can be slightly increased with increase in Y6 content in the acceptor due to the relatively strong photon harvesting in the long wavelength range by Y6. The enhanced photon utilization efficiency can be confirmed from the corresponding EQE spectra. The transmission spectra of the blend films with distinct Y6 content in acceptors are shown in Fig. S7.† Apparently, the transmittance of blend films is decreased in the long wavelength range over 800 nm, which is conducive to improving the performance of OSCs. The key photovoltaic parameters of the opaque OSCs and AVT of corresponding blend films are summarized in Table 2. A PCE of 16.05% is achieved in opaque ternary OSCs, benefiting from the simultaneously increased JSC of 23.21 mA cm−2 and FF of 76.74%. The VOCs of opaque ternary OSCs gradually decreased with increase in Y6 content, which can be well explained from the relatively low VOC of D18-Cl:Y6 binary OSCs and the slightly varied dependence of Y6-1O:Y6 alloyed states on their relative content. It should be highlighted that the AVTs of the ternary blend films reach 50.1%, suggesting that the ternary strategy has great potential in achieving simultaneous improvement in the PCE and AVT of semitransparent OSCs.

By replacing 100 nm Ag by Au (1 nm)/Ag (20, 15 or 10 nm) as semitransparent electrodes, semitransparent ternary OSCs were fabricated with D18-Cl:Y6-1O:Y6 (0.7:0.8:0.8, wt/wt) as active layers. The thickness of the Ag layer was adjusted to achieve excellent trade-off between the transmittance and conductivity of the combined Au/Ag electrode, which will influence photon harvesting of the active layer and electron collection efficiency by the Au/Ag electrode. The J–V curves of semitransparent OSCs with the distinctly thick Ag layer were measured under simulated AM 1.5G solar light illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2, as shown in Fig. 5a. Light is incident from the ITO side during the whole measurement processes. It is apparent that the JSCs of semitransparent ternary OSCs gradually decreased with the thin Ag layer, more incident photon will be lost through penetrating the Au/Ag electrode. Gradual decrease in FFs can be observed with decrease in Ag layer thickness, which should be mainly due to the decreased conductivity of the Au/Ag electrode with the thin Ag layer. The transmittance spectra of semitransparent OSCs were measured, as shown in Fig. 5b. It is emphasized that the test beam spot is entirely confined within the effective area during the measurement process. The AVT values of semitransparent OSCs gradually increased with decrease in Ag layer thickness. The detailed photovoltaic parameters of semitransparent OSCs are summarized in Table 3. The PCE and AVT of semitransparent ternary OSCs are 15.47% and 8.3%, 14.18% and 12.7%, and 13.02% and 20.2% for the Au/Ag electrodes with 20, 15 or 10 nm Ag layers. The FFs of all semitransparent ternary OSCs are larger than 75%, indicating the excellent conductivity of Au/Ag electrodes.

The EQE spectra of semitransparent ternary OSCs were measured, as shown in Fig. 5c. The calculated JSCs are obtained by integrating the corresponding EQE spectra of semitransparent ternary OSCs, as listed in Table 3. The differences between measured and calculated JSCs of all semitransparent ternary OSCs are less than 5%. Quantum utilization efficiency (QUE) is defined as the sum of transmittance and EQE, which is used to further evaluate the PCE and AVT of semitransparent OSCs,43,44 as shown in Fig. 5c. The QUE values of semitransparent ternary OSCs are less than 83% in the whole spectral range, resulting from the inevitable photon and charge loss. The light utilization efficiency (LUE) is defined as the product of PCE and AVT of semitransparent OSCs, which is employed to evaluate the comprehensive performance of semitransparent OSCs.45–48 The reflected light intensity of Ag electrodes gradually declined with decrease in Ag layer thickness, which is beneficial for reducing the photon loss of semitransparent OSCs to achieve high AVT and LUE. The LUEs of all semitransparent ternary OSCs are listed in Table 3. The LUEs of semitransparent OSCs gradually increased from 1.28% to 2.63% with decrease in Ag layer thickness from 20 nm to 10 nm. An LUE of 2.63% is achieved in semitransparent ternary OSCs with 10 nm Ag layer, indicating the more efficient solar light utilization efficiency. The color rendering property of semitransparent OSCs was measured by using PR-655 (Photo Research), as shown in the CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram in Fig. 5d. The ordinary white light source is chosen as the background light source, the color coordinates of the ordinary white light source are located in (0.3250, 0.3375) with a correlative color temperature (CCT) of 5841 K. The color coordinates of the semitransparent OSCs are (0.2448, 0.2080), (0.2549, 0.2267) and (0.2729, 0.2536) with Ag layer thickness of 20, 15 and 10 nm, corresponding to a CCT of ∞, 171459 and 15528 K, respectively. The semitransparent ternary OSCs exhibit a PCE of 13.02%, an AVT of 20.2%, and an LUE of 2.63% with Au (1 nm)/Ag (10 nm) as the electrode.
Conclusions
In summary, the PCE of opaque OSCs was optimized by adjusting the broad bandgap donor D18-Cl content to well balance the JSC and FF. Meanwhile, the AVT of blend films simultaneously increased with decrease in D18-Cl content. 14.92% PCE is achieved in the opaque OSCs with D18-Cl:Y6-1O (1.1:1.6 or 0.7:1.6, wt/wt) as the active layer; the AVT of the corresponding blend films increased from 30.3% to 47.3% due to the decrease in D18-Cl content. The more narrower bandgap acceptor Y6 was selected as the third component to prepare ternary OSCs due to the good compatibility between Y6-1O and Y6 with similar chemical structures. A PCE of 16.05% is achieved in opaque ternary OSCs with D18-Cl:Y6-1O:Y6 (0.7:0.8:0.8, wt/wt) as active layers, the AVT of the corresponding ternary blend film improved to 50.1%. Based on the well optimized opaque ternary OSCs, semitransparent ternary OSCs were fabricated with Au (1 nm)/Ag (20, 15, 10 nm) as electrodes. A PCE of 13.02%, an AVT of 20.2% and an LUE of 2.63% are achieved in semitransparent ternary OSCs with 10 nm thick Ag layer, which are among the highest values for semitransparent OSCs. The work demonstrates that there is great potential for achieving efficient semitransparent OSCs by adjusting D:A weight ratios and employing the ternary strategy with one more narrow bandgap material as the third component, as well as optimizing semitransparent electrodes with high transmittance and conductivity.
