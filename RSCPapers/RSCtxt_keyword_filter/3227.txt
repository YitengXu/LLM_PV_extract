    , Accepted 9th July 2019First published on 10th July 2019AbstractThree compounds based on the phenyltetrazole system, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)tetrazole (LTz-1), 5-(4-methoxyphenyl)tetrazole (LTz-2) and 5-(4-hexyloxyphenyl)tetrazole (LTz-3), were synthesized and characterized as co-adsorbents in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The effects of hydrophobic chain length of the co-adsorbent and the effects of tetrazole anchoring group on the properties of DSSCs containing the previously reported dye HD-2 were compared with the benchmark deoxycholic acid (DCA). The charge-transfer resistance of the dye/TiO2 interface followed the order HD-2–DCA > HD-2–LTz-2 > HD-2–LTz-3 > HD-2–LTz-1. However, the Voc of the dye HD-2 with co-adsorbent DCA was 0.66 V, for the dye HD-2 with co-adsorbent LTz-1, it was 0.70 V, for the dye HD-2 with co-adsorbent LTz-2, it was 0.68 V and for the dye HD-2 with co-adsorbent LTz-3, it was 0.67 V. Co-adsorbents LTz-1, LTz-2 and LTz-3 achieved a mean solar-to-power conversion efficiency (%η), for the three devices, of 8.29, 7.63 and 8.49, respectively, compared to 7.76 for DCA under the same experimental device conditions. For the LTz-3 co-adsorbent, the results can be attributed to the repellent effect of the long alkyl chain. For LTz-1 and LTz-2 co-adsorbents, it is possible that the more compact layer formed improves electron-injection efficiency into TiO2.
1. Introduction
The development of alternative sources of energy generation is justified by the need for environmental preservation and the finite nature of fossil fuels. In this context, the use of solar energy as an alternative becomes quite attractive. However, the high cost of silicon-based solar cell technology restricts its competitiveness compared to conventional methods of power generation.1 About 27 years ago, Grätzel and O’Regan published an article in Nature that described a remarkably efficient photochemical solar cell based on the dye sensitization of mesoporous nanocrystalline TiO2 films.2 This type of solar cell technology offered the promise of achieving moderate efficiency devices at relatively low cost. In more recent years, significant effort has been devoted toward improving power conversion efficiency (PCE) in DSSCs.3,4 In this regard, organic sensitizers have received increasing attention because of their ease of synthesis and high molar extinction coefficients in comparison with metal-complex sensitizers.5 Research on organic sensitizers has mainly focused on molecular modification, especially donor and/or p-linker modification.6 As a result, dyes were obtained that show greater conjugation and broader absorption spectra. However, these modifications did not guarantee efficiency in DSSCs, as the bulky molecular structures could decrease the amount of dye loading onto the TiO2 surface. In DSSCs, electrons injected into the conduction band (CB) of the semiconductor tend to recombine with either the oxidized form of the dye or the oxidized form of the redox couple, resulting in a “dark current” and a concomitant decrease of the overall power conversion efficiency of the cell.6,7 Also, when the dye molecules are packed very tightly to form aggregates, the overlap of their wave functions is large enough to change their electronic character. This often causes the excited states of the dye molecules to be quenched before the electron transfer can occur.8 Furthermore, the surface protonation of the sensitized semiconductor film and the resulting change in the dye adsorption mode and conformation (or even dye desorption) decrease the long-term stability of the device. These three phenomena, that is, charge recombination, dye aggregation, and semiconductor surface protonation, are important unwanted processes that all impede DSSC operation. Therefore, there have been several attempts to understand and, most importantly, suppress their occurrence. The most successful effort so far has been the use of substances that can be adsorbed simultaneously onto the photo anode of DSSCs competitively with the dye molecules, thus blocking the vacant spots on the semiconductor surface uncovered by dye molecules. Due to their adsorption function, which is combined with the chemisorption of dyes, these substances are called co-adsorbents.9
The geometry and molecular orientation of a dye are other important factors; they control the nature and extent of electron recombination processes in a DSSC device (Fig. 1), since the binding mode will somewhat constrain the dye orientation upon the TiO2 surface (Fig. 1a). However, the intrinsic molecular conformation of a dye on a TiO2 interface is another important consideration. In particular, the electronic or steric characteristics will determine if the dye can shield the TiO2 surface from electrolyte attack. In cases where the dyes exhibit conformers of bulky chemical substituents that surround the anchoring group (Fig. 1b), this structural formation will tend to stabilize the dye, thereby preventing recombination effects from TiO2-to-dye electron back transfer. The overall 3-D shape of a given dye conformer will also dictate the lateral spacing between dye molecules across the TiO2 surface; small inter-dye spacings are best to preclude unwanted molecules or ions reaching the TiO2 (Fig. 1c and d).

(b) Dye orientation such that bulky substituents protect the anchoring group from the desorption process, thereby promoting the electron injection. (c) Dye and co-adsorbent oriented such that their electronic or steric effects shield the TiO2 surface. (d) Dependence of dye orientation and co-adsorbent to prevent the electron recombination processes. 
The combination of a co-adsorbent and a dye provides a more efficient insulating barrier for the back electron transfer from the TiO2 CB to I3− (oxidized form of the redox couple) in comparison to DSSCs not utilizing a co-adsorbent. The obstruction of this unwanted redox process results in the enhancement of the photocurrent, the photovoltage, and the power conversion efficiency of the corresponding DSSCs. Since then, improved conversion efficiencies have been achieved in co-sensitized solar cells using organic dyes,10–12 or metal-complexes and organic dyes.13,14 However, there are limited investigations available on organic molecules, which serve as both co-adsorbents and complementary dyes used for co-sensitized solar cells. In this work, we sought to improve the knowledge of the effects of molecules as co-adsorbents in DSSC systems. For this purpose, three new compounds derived from the 5-phenyltetrazole system were prepared for use as co-adsorbents for the HD-2 dye in DSSCs (Fig. 2). Their effect as co-adsorbents was compared with the prototype deoxycholic acid (DCA).

2. Experimental
2.1. General information
The solvents and chemicals used were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Fisher Scientific or TCI-America and used as received. The mass spectrometry analysis was carried out on a high-resolution mass spectrometer – a Thermo Fisher Scientific Exactive Plus MS, a benchtop full-scan OrbitrapTM mass spectrometer using heated electrospray ionization (HESI). Samples were dissolved in methanol and sonicated for 15 min. They were then diluted 1:1 with 20 mM ammonium acetate and analyzed via syringe injection into the mass spectrometer at a flow rate of 10 ml min−1. The instrument was operated in negative ion mode. Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR/FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Thermo Nicolet, Nexus 470 FTIR spectrophotometer with Omnic 7.2 software. The compound under investigation was placed in its powdered form on a germanium crystal and a pressure probe was placed in position to infrared radiation apply. 1H NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker 500 MHz or Varian 200 MHz spectrometer.

2.2.3 Synthesis of HD-2. 

HD-2 was synthesized according to the procedures reported by Cheema.17

2.3. TiO2 electrode preparation and device fabrication
The photo-anodes composed of nanocrystalline TiO2 and counter electrodes were prepared using literature procedures.18 Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass (2.2 mm thickness, sheet resistance of 8 U cm−2, TEC 8, Pilkington) was washed with detergent, water, acetone and ethanol, sequentially. After this, FTO glass plates were immersed into a 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min and washed with water and ethanol. A thin layer (8–12 mm thick) of TiO2 (Solaronix, Ti-Nanoxide D/SP) was deposited (active area, 0.18 cm2) on transparent conducting glass by squeegee printing. After drying the electrodes at 120 °C for 6 min, scattering layer (5 mm thick) TiO2 particles (Solaronix, Ti-Nanoxide R/SP) were printed. The TiO2 electrodes were heated under airflow at 350 °C for 10 min, followed by heating at 500 °C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the TiO2 electrodes were treated with a 40 mM aqueous solution of TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 min and then washed with water and ethanol. The electrodes were heated again at 500 °C for 30 min and left to cool to 80 °C before dipping into the dye solution. The dye solutions (0.3 mM) were prepared in 1:1:1 acetonitrile, tert-butyl alcohol and DMSO. Deoxycholic acid (DCA), or LTz-1, or LTz-2 or LTz-3, was added to the dye solution as a co-adsorbent at a concentration of 20 mM. The electrodes were immersed in the dye solutions with active area facing up and then kept at 25 °C for 20 h to adsorb the dye onto the TiO2 surface. For preparing the counter electrode, pre-cut TCO glass was washed with water followed by 0.1 M HCl in EtOH, and sonication in an acetone bath for 10 min. The washed TCO glass was then dried at 400 °C for 15 min. A thin layer of Pt-paste (Solaronix, Platisol T/SP) on the TCO was printed and the printed electrodes were then cured at 450 °C for 10 min. The dye sensitized TiO2 electrodes were sandwiched with Pt counter electrodes, and sealed using a 40 μm Surlyn spacer by heating of the polymer frame. The electrolyte (Solaronix, Iodolyte AN-50) was then injected into the cell, while the two electrodes were held together with the clips.
2.4. Photo-electrochemical measurements
Photocurrent–voltage characteristics of the DSSCs were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under illumination of AM 1.5 G solar light from a solar simulator (SOL3A, Oriel) equipped with a 450 W xenon lamp (91160, Oriel). The incident light intensity was calibrated using a reference Si solar cell (Newport Oriel, 91150V) to set 1 Sun (100 mW cm−2). The measurement was fully controlled by Oriel IV Test Station software. IPCE (incident monochromatic photon to current conversion efficiency) experiments were carried out using a system (QEX10, PV Measurements, USA) equipped with a 75 W short arc xenon lamp (UXL-75XE, USHIO, Japan) as a light source connected to a monochromator. Calibration of incident light was performed before measurements using a silicon photodiode (IF035, PV Measurements). All the measurements were carried out without the use of anti-reflecting film.
2.5. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
The electrochemical impedance spectra were measured with an impedance analyzer potentiostat (Bio-Logic SP-150) under illumination using a solar simulator (SOL3A, Oriel) equipped with a 450 W xenon lamp (91160, Oriel). EIS spectra were recorded over a frequency range of 100 MHz–200 kHz at room temperature. The applied bias voltage was set at the Voc of the DSSCs, with AC amplitude set at 10 mV. The electrical impedance spectra were fitted using Z-Fit software (Bio-Logic).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis of co-adsorbents
The synthetic routes used for the preparation of compounds LTz-1, LTz-2 and LTz-3 are shown in Scheme 1. 4-Hydroxybenzonitrile (1) was converted to the tetrazole heterocycle by a Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (LTz-1) or by the reaction with bromoalkane and then conversion to the tetrazole heterocycle by a Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition with sodium azide (LTz-2 and LTz-3).15,16 All the compounds were fully characterized by mass spectroscopy, NMR and IR spectroscopy. HD-2 was also synthesized according to a previously reported procedure.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic route of co-adsorbents LTz-1, LTz-2 and LTz-3. 
In order to determine the practical utility of the synthesized molecules (LTz-1, LTZ-2 and LTz-3) as co-adsorbents in DSSCs, deoxycholic acid (DCA) was used as the standard and HD-2 was used as the dye. Nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes were prepared according to the procedure reported previously.19 Sandwich type DSSCs were prepared from stained photodiodes and a Pt coated cathode. Photovoltaic measurements were carried out after introducing the electrolyte between the glass electrodes.
3.2 Photovoltaic parameters of DSSCs
There are two widely used techniques for photovoltaic characterization: current–voltage measurements under simulated sunlight (producing J–V curves) and monochromatic light generated current measurements (producing incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra). The photovoltaic parameters including short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) can be obtained by the current–voltage measurements.20 The IPCE value corresponds to the photocurrent density that is produced in the external circuit under monochromatic illumination of the cell divided by the photon flux that strikes the cell. The IPCE is determined by the light harvesting ability, the amount of adsorbed dye on the TiO2 surface, the overall charge collection efficiency and the overall electron injection efficiency. It is noted that the maximum IPCEs for DSSCs generally should be smaller than 90% because of the reflection and absorption loss due to the FTO glass. Fig. 3 shows the IPCE response as a function of wavelength.
 Fig. 3  Photocurrent action spectra (IPCE) obtained with the dyes HD-2–DCA, HD-2–LTz-1, HD-2–LTz-2 and HD-2–LTz-3. The concentration of the co-adsorbent used was 20 mm for all dyes. 
An incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) response of higher than 60% was exhibited by HD-2–LTz-3 at 490 nm–570 nm (reaching a maximum of 63% at 530–540 nm) and by HD-2–LTz-1 at 500 nm–560 nm (reaching a maximum of 61.3% at 530–540 nm). An IPCE response as high as 60% was achieved by HD-2–DCA at 500 nm–560 nm (reaching a maximum of 62.84% at 540 nm). These results indicate that there is no direct relationship between the amphiphilic characteristic and co-adsorbent effect for DSSCs. Other factors are also likely to be involved. This possibility is confirmed by the result presented by the HD-2–LTz-1 dye, which presented results very close to that presented by the HD-2–DCA dye. On the other hand, the IPCE presented by the HD-2–LTz-2 dye was inferior to the result presented by the HD-2–DCA dye.
The photovoltaic parameters including the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factors (FFs) and overall cell efficiency (%η) are summarized in Table 1 and the I–V results are shown in Fig. 4. HD-2–DCA resulted in a photocurrent density (Jsc) of 20.28 mA cm−2, HD-2–LTz-1 resulted in a Jsc of 18.71 mA cm−2, HD-2–LTz-2 resulted in a Jsc of 19.97 mA cm−2 and HD-2–LTz-3 resulted in a Jsc of 22.53 mA cm−2, respectively. The fact that some compositions have higher values of photocurrent density can be attributed to the co-adsorbent favoring photon capture and the more favorable injection of electrons into TiO2. The dye HD-2–DCA resulted in a Voc of 0.66 V, the dye HD-2–LTz-1 resulted in a Voc of 0.70 V, the dye HD-2–LTz-2 resulted in a Voc of 0.68 V and the dye HD-2–LTz-3 resulted in a Voc of 0.67 V.

 Fig. 4  Photocurrent–voltage characteristics of DSSCs sensitized with HD-2–DCA, HD-2–LTz-1, HD-2–LTz-2 and HD-2–LTz-3. The concentration of the co-adsorbent used was 20 mm for all dyes. 
The use of LTz-3 as a co-adsorbent was shown to be more efficient. The dye HD-2–LTz-3 resulted in a Jsc of 22.53 mA cm−2 and Voc of 0.67 V, translating into a total conversion efficiency (%η) of 8.49%, and the dye HD-2–LTz-1 resulted in a Jsc of 18.71 mA cm−2 and Voc of 0.70 V, translating into a total conversion efficiency (%η) of 8.29%, both surpassing the benchmark HD-2–DCA (%η) of 7.76%. The dye HD-2–LTz-2 resulted in a Jsc of 19.97 mA cm−2 and Voc of 0.68 V, translating into a total conversion efficiency (%η) of 7.63%, very close to the benchmark HD-2–DCA.
In previous studies, HD-2 and N719 with the DCA co-adsorbent on a nanocrystalline TiO2 electrode were studied under standard conditions.17HD-2 and N719 resulted in a Jsc of 20.02 and 16.85 mA cm−2, respectively, corresponding to a conversion efficiency %η of 7.93 and 9.35, respectively. The experimentally obtained values for the HD-2 dye with the DCA co-adsorbent in this work are similar to those described in the literature (Table 1). The Jsc of 22.53 mA cm−2 for HD-2–LTz-3 is 10% higher than the Jsc of HD-2–DCA, which can be attributed to the greater photon harvesting and more energetically favorable electron injection into TiO2 provided by the co-adsorbent. HD-2–LTz-1 resulted in a Jsc (18.71 mA cm−2) 9% lower than the Jsc of HD-2–DCA (20.28 18.71 mA cm−2), corresponding to a conversion efficiency (%η) 7% higher than that of HD-2–DCA. Under optimized cell working conditions, the co-adsorbents LTz-1, LTz-2 and LTz-3 did not show substantial differences in Voc for the HD-2 dye.
3.3 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) successfully models the charge transfer and chemical capacitance at the interface of TiO2 dye/electrolyte and Pt/electrolyte in a DSSC under operational conditions.21,22 Combination of charge transfer resistance (Rct) and chemical capacitance gives rise to a semicircle in the complex plane. When comparing results from dyes with different chemical structures, we can say that in the EIS Nyquist plots, the first semicircle at high frequency corresponds to the cathode in a DSSC, the middle semicircle corresponds to charge transfer resistance at the interface of dye/TiO2 combined with chemical capacitance of electrons in TiO2 (eTiO2), and the third semicircle (not observed in this experiment) corresponds to a finite Warburg impedance element. The bigger the radius of the middle semicircle, the higher the Rct from TiO2 to electrolyte corresponding to Nernst impedance. The radius of the same semicircle corresponds to the resistance of charge diffusion (Rd) under Gerischer impedance.23 However, our results reflect the effect of the co-adsorbent on the same dye, HD-2. In the EIS Nyquist plots (Fig. 5), for all dyes, two semicircles were observed. In the EIS Nyquist plots, the intermediate frequency range indicates the electron recombination resistance, which was in the following order HD-2–DCA > HD-2–LTz-2 > HD-2–LTz-3 > HD-2–LTz-1, respectively.
 Fig. 5  EIS Nyquist plots for DSSCs sensitized with HD-2–DCA, HD-2–LTz-1, HD-2–LTz-2 and HD-2–LTz-3. 
Thus, the higher the charge recombination resistance in the Nyquist plot, the higher the photovoltage obtained from solar cells, owing to slower charge recombination of electrons in TiO2 (eTiO2) and electron acceptors in electrolyte, resulting in a higher eTiO2 lifetime.24,25 A small semicircle at higher frequency models the cathode charge transfer resistance, which is directly related to FF. In an efficient solar cell, Nernst impedance Rct is greater than Rd, as observed for HD-2–DCA. For HD-2, the new co-adsorbents tested show a higher resistance of charge diffusion proportional to Rct than that of the DCA co-adsorbent.23,26
In Fig. 6, the frequency response regime in the range of 1–100 Hz is an indicator of the electron recombination between electrolyte and TiO2 and is related to the electron lifetime in the CB of TiO2. The electron lifetime depends on the density of charge traps, which is ultimately related to Voc. The injected electron lifetime eTiO2 can be determined by using the relation τCB = 1/(2πf), where τ is the lifetime of electrons in TiO2 and f is the mid-frequency peak in Bode plots. eTiO2 depends on the density of charge traps, which is ultimately related to Voc.18 The middle-frequency peak of the DSSCs based on HD-2–LTz-3 was observed to be slightly shifted to low frequency compared to HD-2–DCA (Fig. 6). The frequency peak of the DSSCs in the range of 1–100 Hz based on HD-2–DCA, HD-2–LTz-1, HD-2–LTz-2 and HD-2–LTz-3 was at 77.6 Hz, 77.6 Hz, 77.6 Hz and 52.4 Hz, corresponding to eTiO2 values of 20 ms, 20 ms, 20 ms and 30 ms, respectively. The eTiO2 is higher for HD-2–LTz-3, but for the other dyes, it has the same value.
 Fig. 6  EIS Bode plots for DSSCs sensitized with HD-2–DCA, HD-2–LTz-1, HD-2–LTz-2 and HD-2–LTz-3. 
For a defined redox electrolyte in DSSCs, it is known that a variance of electron quasi-Fermi-level (EF,n) in titania can evoke a rise or fall of Voc.27 A displacement of EF,n could be caused by a fluctuation of titania conduction band edge (Ec) and/or a variation of free electron density (n). The electron density in titania is kinetically balanced by the flux of charge photogeneration and that of charge recombination. The charge recombination can be evaluated by measuring the lifetime (t) of electrons in titania films with impedance spectroscopy.28 The lifetime of electrons in TiO2 based on HD-2–LTz-3 was 30 ms and 50% higher than those of the other co-adsorbents evaluated. Wang et al. also perceived a similar phenomenon when the end alkyl chains of dyes were prolonged. For the same dye with dodecyl chains, the electron lifetimes are about one-order more than those with ethyl chains. The increase in the lifetime provided a significant increase in the total conversion efficiency (%η). The explanation for this behavior is that the side or end alkyl chain elongation should yield a thicker organic blocking layer with a smaller molecule tilt angle with respect to the substrate normal, which overwhelms the adverse effect and provides a higher electron density in titania.29–32 The hydrophobic end acts as a buffer between the semiconductor and the electrolyte, thus effectively preventing back-transfer of electrons from the semiconductor's CB to the redox couple or the oxidized dye molecules, so that unwanted recombination is reduced.33–35 On the other hand, the co-adsorbents LTz-1 and LTz-2 do not have amphiphilic characteristics, but their photoconversion efficiencies are similar to that of the co-adsorbent DCA (LTz-2) and higher than that of the co-adsorbent DCA (LTz-1).
Long alkyl chains can suppress the dye aggregation on the TiO2 film during dye uptake process and improve the device efficiency. Such an improvement is mainly observed in organic dyes.36 In the case of Ru-based (octahedral) small size dyes, like HD-2, dye aggregation is not so strong and a compact monolayer on the TiO2 film can form easily, resulting in a long electron lifetime.37 One possible reason for the high efficiency of the HD-2–LTz-1 based DSSC can be attributed to the bulkiness of the co-adsorbent dye set, leading to more compact monolayer formation, which hinders the recombination of conduction band electrons back to the electrolyte. The same rearrangement may also be used to justify the observed behavior of the dye HD-2–LTz-2. In this regard, it has been reported that a strong interaction between neighboring molecules on the substrates leads to deactivation of the excited state via self-quenching processes.38,39 These reports suggested that the reduced surface aggregation due to the co-adsorbents, which suppresses quenching processes due to energy transfer or charge-transfer reactions between the aggregated molecules and/or between molecules in the aggregates and monomers, leads to the improved IPCE performance. Considering that the overall performance of DSSCs depends on the electron injection efficiency, we suggest that the improved IPCE performance of DSSCs based on LTz-1 and LTz-3 may arise from the prevention of the deactivation of the excited state via quenching processes between dye and co-adsorbents. Due to the planarity of the bi-isonicotinic acid system and the near-planarity of the phenyltetrazole system (the tetrazole and phenyl rings have a dihedral angle of 14.8(1)° between the planes),40 strong hydrogen bonds and π–π interactions can occur. The results of these strong interactions are the formation of a more compact layer that allows charge-transfer from the dye to the phenyltetrazole system via π–π stacking interactions that improve electron-injection efficiency into TiO2. However, the tetrazole anchoring group is very similar to a carboxylate group. The strong interactions between TiO2 surface and the carboxylate group can be evidenced by two short Ti–O distances (2.09 Å) corresponding to a bridging coordination mode. In the case of the tetrazole as the anchoring group, the optimized geometry indicated that the interaction of the tetrazole with the surface occurs via a short Ti–N distance (2.53 Å) and an additional longer one (3.48 Å).41 Thus, similar to the carboxylic acid derivative, the tetrazole-end-capped derivative adopts a strong chemisorption-like coordination mode to attach to TiO2. With this in mind, it can be stated that the anchoring group tetrazole can exert the same effect as the carboxylic acid anchoring group, allowing an alternative approach to enhance the efficiency of electron injection into TiO2, which would explain the observed results.
4. Conclusion
The development of new materials for DSSCs and understanding the interaction between them remain a major challenge in creating innovative hybrid materials with valuable functionality. In the present study, new phenyltetrazole derivatives were evaluated as co-adsorbents with HD-2 dye attached to TiO2 thin films. The photovoltaic performance of phenyltetrazoles in DSSCs was explored and compared to that of the DCA co-adsorbent. Overall, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the tetrazole functional group as an alternative co-adsorbent moiety for organic photosensitizers. Structural characteristics of the evaluated co-adsorbents allow the distinction of two effects that contribute to enhancing the efficiency of photo-injection in DSSCs. These effects allow more efficient charge transfer from dye to the phenyltetrazole system via π–π stacking interactions, which improves electron-injection efficiency into TiO2. These results demonstrate a strong dependence of the electron injection process on TiO2 to increase the efficiency of DSSCs.
