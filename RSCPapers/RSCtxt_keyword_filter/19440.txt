Here, we reported the preparation of inorganic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs through a ligand exchange strategy.

Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) demonstrate specific advantages over other photovoltaic devices, namely low cost, environmental friendliness, simple production processes and good plasticity.1–3 Generally, DSSCs have a sandwich structure with a photoanode comprising TiO2 sensitized by dye molecules, an electrolyte containing the redox couple of iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−), and a CE catalyzing the reduction of I3− to I−. Among them, the CE is a crucial component for achieving high performance which performs two critical functions: it collects the electrons flowing from the external circuit and catalyzes the reduction of I3− to I−.4 Therefore, good catalysis and high conductivity are two key factors for an ideal CE. To date, Pt is the most common used CE material owing to its high electrical conductivity and superior electrocatalytic activity. However, Pt is a noble metal with high cost, which prevents it from large-scale manufacturing. Since carbon powder was used as CE in DSSCs,5 several kinds of materials have been explored as alternative for CEs in DSSCs, including carbon materials,6–8 conductive polymers9–11 and inorganic materials.12–14 Compared to carbon materials and conductive polymers, inorganic materials have unique properties such as material diversity, abundance, low cost, high catalytic activity, and ease of modification. Among these inorganic materials, multi-metal sulfides have attracted particular attention, and have been reported to have excellent performance due to their unique catalytic and electrical characteristics.15,16 As one of the typical multi-metal sulfides, CuInS2 NCs which represent large specific surface area have been studied using as CE materials for DSSCs.17 Generally, NCs were synthesized by colloidal chemistry and the synthesized NCs were surrounded with a layer of surfactant molecules. The surfactant molecules (also referred to as “organic ligands”) bind to the NCs surface immediately after its nucleation and prevent them from fast growth and coagulation.18 However, these organic ligands also create highly insulating barriers around each NCs and block electronic communication between NCs, which is quite detrimental for electrical conductivity.19,20 During the past few years, high temperature treatment is considered as an effective method to improve the electrical conductivity of the NCs film by pyrolysis of organic ligands.21 However, high temperature treatment often adds significant cost and limits substrate options, including cheap plastic substrates with low melting temperature like polyethylene.22 Therefore, complete removal of surface ligands of the CuInS2 NCs without changing the shape and size distribution of the NCs is necessary. Ligand exchange in solution is an available strategy to achieve this goal, which not only gets rid of bulky alkyl ligands, but also keeps NCs still solution processible.23 In addition, the obtained NCs after ligand exchange have enabled further integration step.
Herein, we prepared inorganic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs through a ligand exchange process for the first time. When used as the counter electrode of DSSCs, inorganic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs can significantly improve the efficiency of DSSCs. To the best of our knowledge, the use of inorganic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs films as potential substitutes for CEs of DSSCs has not been reported. The study in this work may pave a new pathway to explore highly electrical conductivity materials for DSSCs.
Experimental details
Chemicals
Cu(II) acetylacetonate [Cu(acac)2], In(III) acetylacetonate [In(acac)3], ammonium sulfide aqueous solution (20%) [(NH4)2S], 1-dodecanethiol (DDT) and oleylamine (OLA) were purchased from Alfa Aesar and used as received. Chloroform, n-hexane, methanamide (formamide), toluene, ethanol and acetone are analytical grade and used as received. Porous TiO2 photoanode (0.4 cm × 0.4 cm, 13–14 μm), N719 dye and I−/I3− electrolyte were bought from YingKou Opvtech New Energy Co., Ltd.
Ligand-exchange reactions of colloidal NCs
Organic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs were synthesized using a previously reported one-pot route.24 Inorganic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs could be prepared through a ligand exchange process using (NH4)2S as the inorganic ligand. 1 mL (NH4)2S solution was added to 10 mL formamide, and then mixed with 10 mL CuInS2 NCs dispersion in toluene (∼2 mg mL−1) at room temperature. The mixture was stirred until CuInS2 NCs transferred from toluene to the formamide phase completely. The phase transfer can be easily monitored by the color change of toluene (black to colorless) and formamide (light yellow to black) phases (Fig. 1). The organic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs were named as B-CuInS2 NCs (before ligand exchanged CuInS2 NCs), while the inorganic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs were named as A-CuInS2 NCs (after ligand exchanged CuInS2 NCs).

Fabrication of CuInS2 thin film and Pt counter electrode
1 mL A-CuInS2 NCs aqueous solution (∼2.5 mg mL−1) forms a uniform “ink” of inorganic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs. 100 μL CuInS2 NCs “ink” was then drop-casted onto the cleaned FTO glass substrate (1.5 × 1.5 cm2). The A-CuInS2 NCs films were obtained by fully drying the films at room temperature for 24 h. As a contrast, A-CuInS2 NCs films were sintered at 500 °C for 30 min under the protection of argon. B-CuInS2 NCs films were prepared using the same recipe but with the use of B-CuInS2 NCs. The Pt counter electrode was prepared by sputtering Pt of 100 nm on cleaned FTO glass using radio frequency sputtering at power of 150 W and working pressure of 3 × 10−3 Torr (with argon gas for 60 s).
Fabrication of DSSCs devices
Complete DSSCs devices were assembled in a typical sandwich-type format. TiO2 photoanodes with an effective area of 0.6 × 0.6 cm2 were immersed overnight in 0.3 mM ethanolic solution of dye N-719 (Solaronix) at room temperature to absorb the dye. The TiO2 photoanodes were then taken out and rinsed with ethanol to remove excess dye adsorbed and dried in air at room temperature. The sandwich-type solar cell was assembled by placing the counter electrode on N-719 dye sensitized photoelectrode, and clipped together as an open cell for measurements. The cell was then filled with a liquid electrolyte composed of 0.1 M anhydrous LiI, 0.12 M I2, 1.0 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-n-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII) and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in dehydrated acetonitrile by capillary force.
Characterizations
The morphology was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-5600LV) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JSM-2010), respectively. The chemical composition of products was analyzed by energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS, Horiba EMAX Energy EX-350). The phase and crystallographic structure of the products were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Philips X' Pert Pro, Cu-Kα: λ = 0.154056 nm). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 360 FTIR spectrometer using KBr pellets in the range 4000–400 cm−1. Thermogravimetric Analyses (TGA) were carried out on a Mettler-Toledo TGA/SDTA 851e thermal analyzer in a flowing nitrogen atmosphere in the temperature region 25–500 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out in a three electrode system in an acetonitrile solution of 0.1 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI, and 1 mM I2 at a scan rate of 50 mVs−1. The dummy cells used for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis followed the same processes but with the photoanode changed to another counter electrode (CE/electrolyte/CE). Platinum served as a counter electrode and the Ag/Ag+ couple was used as a reference electrode. EIS measurements were performed in the dark at room temperature using an impedance measurement unit (ZAHNER-elektrik IM6) in the frequency range 0.1–105 Hz with an ac amplitude of 10 mV and an applied bias voltage of 0.8 V between the CE and the working electrode. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) measurements were taken on a digital source meter (Keithley 2400, computer-controlled) with the device under AM 1.5 G spectrum, which was produced by a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel class A, SP91160A, USA). The light power density was calibrated against a Si-based reference cell (Hamamatsu S1133) to accurately simulate the full-sun intensity (100 mW cm−2).
Results and discussion
Synthesis of CuInS2 NCs and ligand-exchange reaction
Organic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs were synthesized by a previously reported one-pot route using DDT and OLA as mixed solvent.24 The DDT and OLA molecules (also referred to as “organic ligands”) bind to the CuInS2 NCs surface immediately after its nucleation and prevent them from fast growth and coagulation. So, the synthesized CuInS2 NCs were capped with DDT and OLA. Inorganic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs could be prepared through a ligand exchange process using (NH4)2S as the inorganic ligand. The ligand-exchange reaction and phase transfer can be easily monitored by the color change of toluene (black to colorless) and formamide (light yellow to black) phases (Fig. 1). This ligand exchange phenomenon could be explained by the reaction between (NH4)2S and metal-surfactant ligand complexes. The higher nucleophilic reactivity of S2− than the bulky surfactant ligands (DDT and OLA, in this case) causes a higher reactivity between S2− and metal surfactant ligand complexes, which facilitates the coordination between S2− and metal atoms at the surface of the nanocrystals and enables the removal of the bulky surfactant ligands. TEM images of CuInS2 NCs before and after ligand exchanged were shown in Fig. S1 (Electronic Supplementary Information†). The synthesized CuInS2 NCs prepared by the traditional colloidal method are monodisperse bullet-like NCs with a narrow-size distribution. The average dimension of the organic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs is about 25 nm in diameter and 50 nm in length. After ligand exchange, the bullet-like shape and size distribution of the CuInS2 NCs were preserved. XRD patterns of the CuInS2 NCs before and after ligand exchange were shown in Fig. S2 (Electronic Supplementary Information†). The XRD pattern of the inorganic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs can be indexed to wurtzite phase CuInS2, which is the same as that of organic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs (Fig. S2, ESI†). In other words, the ligand exchange process does not affect the shape, size distribution and crystal structure.
In order to study the ligand exchange occurs on the surface of CuInS2 NCs, FTIR and TGA characterizations were used to confirm the change of the CuInS2 NCs before and after ligand exchange. Fig. 2 shows the FTIR spectra of CuInS2 NCs before and after ligand exchange. Before ligand exchange, the sharp peaks at 2849, 2925 and 1466 cm−1, which corresponds to C–H stretching of OLA from organic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs are obviously (Fig. 2). After treated with (NH4)2S, these C–H stretching peaks of OLA disappeared. These results confirm the original organic ligands are nearly complete removed and replaced by S2− ligands. The same conclusion can also be drawn from TGA analyses (Fig. 3). The thermal decomposition model of inorganic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs is also quite different from that of organic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs. The organic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs showed two major mass loss ranges at about 250–400 °C and 600–650 °C, which may attributed to the decomposition of DDT and OLA. While, the inorganic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs showed a little mass loss range before 300 °C. The total weight loss of the inorganic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs is 5.24%, which is lower than that of the organic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs (18.36%), further suggesting the successful remove of most of organic ligand (OLA and/or DDT). Elemental analysis of CuInS2 NCs before and after ligand exchange revealed the increase of S content in CuInS2 NCs (Table 1). This result certified the addition of a small amount of S2− onto the CuInS2 NCs surface and the replacement of organic ligand (OLA and/or DDT). All the results above demonstrated the ligand exchange occurs on the surface of CuInS2 NCs.

Characterizations of CuInS2 films
In order to study the potential use of different CuInS2 NCs for CEs in DSSCs, CuInS2 thin films were fabricated by organic and inorganic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs. Fig. 4 shows the SEM images of CuInS2 NCs films prepared by organic and inorganic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs. As shown in Fig. 4a, B-CuInS2 NCs appeared to be touching or even fused together for the cape of a large number of organic ligands. After ligand exchange, this kind of connection decreased, while the A-CuInS2 NCs film is still plane and compact (Fig. 4b). After sintering at 500 °C, the CuInS2 NCs of the B-CuInS2 NCs film grow up and became larger (Fig. 4c). And the presence of pinholes might allow the escape of volatile solvent and OLA from the organic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs. Meanwhile, the CuInS2 thin films fabricated from inorganic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs is smooth, dense and uniform after sintering at 500 °C. From Fig. 4d, we can see that the thickness of the A-CuInS2 film is approximately 0.5 μm.

Photovoltaic properties
The fabricated CuInS2 thin films were used as CEs in DSSCs. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics of these DSSCs prepared using various CEs are shown in Fig. 5, while the photovoltaic performances of these DSSCs are listed in Table 2. The DSSC with organic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs films without sintering (B-CuInS2) as counter electrode has an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.73 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 2.38 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.1993, leading to a poor conversion efficiency (Z) of 0.35%. When the organic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs films treated with sintering at 500 °C (BS-CuInS2), the corresponding DSSC has the following photovoltaic parameters: VOC = 0.78 V, JSC = 12.34 mA cm−2, FF = 0.6509, and Z = 6.25%. The significant increase of JSC and FF, which was caused by pyrolysis of organic ligands, led to a remarkable improvement of the conversion efficiency. Meanwhile, the inorganic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs films without sintering (A-CuInS2) based DSSC exhibited a VOC of 0.78 V, a JSC of 12.37 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.6544, and an overall conversion efficiency of 6.32%. When the inorganic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs films treated with sintering at 500 °C (AS-CuInS2), the corresponding DSSC has the following photovoltaic parameters: VOC = 0.78 V, JSC = 12.37 mA cm−2, FF = 0.6741, and Z = 6.49%. It should be noted that the conversion efficiency of DSSC increased by 17 times after the organic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs were exchanged with inorganic ligand. Even after sintering at 500 °C, the conversion efficiency of DSSC based on inorganic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs is still higher than that of organic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs. Interestingly, the conversion efficiency of DSSC based on inorganic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs is also higher than that of organic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs film with sintering treatment. These results demonstrated that the ligand exchange process could effectively remove the organic ligand capped on the surface of CuInS2 NCs, which is more economical and environmentally friendly than high temperature treatment. Under the same illumination, the typical Pt based DSSC exhibited a VOC = 0.77 V, JSC = 13.08 mA cm−2, FF = 0.6816, and Z = 6.89%. The inorganic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs film CE gave a similar conversion efficiency with that of Pt CE, indicating the potential replacement of Pt CE in low-cost and high-efficiency DSSCs.

Cyclic voltammograms and electrochemistry impedance spectra of the CEs
To better interpret the reason why inorganic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs film CE exhibited high conversion efficiency, cyclic voltammograms (CV) and electrochemistry impedance spectra (EIS) of different kinds CEs were carried out at the same conditions. The CV could evaluate the electrocatalytic activity for reduction I3− to I− for various CEs. As shown in Fig. 6, two typical pairs of oxidation–reduction peaks were observed for the various CEs except B-CuInS2 NCs film. Due to the insulating barriers (organic ligand, OLA), the B-CuInS2 NCs film exhibited the lowest electrocatalytic activity for reduction I3− to I−. The peak currents and the peak-to-peak separation (Epp, Ox-1 to Red-1) are two important parameters for comparing catalytic activities of different CEs.25 Higher peak current densities and lower Epp values revealing higher electrochemical catalyst for the reduction of I3− to I−. As listed in Table 2, all the Epp values are more than 30 mV, so the reaction of the I3−/I− redox couple at the CEs/electrolyte interface is a quasi-reversible electrode process. The A-CuInS2 NCs and AS-CuInS2 CEs exhibited the lowest Epp values, even lower than Pt CE. The A-CuInS2 NCs and AS-CuInS2 CEs shown similar peak current densities with Pt CE, which is large than B-CuInS2 NCs and BS-CuInS2 CEs. These results indicated higher catalytic activity for reduction I3− to I− at A-CuInS2 NCs and AS-CuInS2 CEs than B-CuInS2 NCs and BS-CuInS2 CEs. CV measurement was also carried out at a relatively low scan rate (10 mV s−1, in this case). The CV of different electrodes carried out at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 shows similar results to that of CV carried out at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. (Fig. S3, ESI†) Fig. 7 shows the Nyquist plots of devices using different CEs. According to the equivalent circuit diagram inset in Fig. 7, the high-frequency intercept on the real axis represents the series resistance (RS). The semicircle in the high-frequency range results from the charge-transfer resistance (RCT) and the double-layer capacitance (C). The values of RS and RCT obtained by fitting the spectra in Fig. 7 using EIS spectrum analyzer are summarized in Table 2. The B-CuInS2 CEs shows the largest RS and RCT values, that can be attributed to the organic ligand capped on the surface of CuInS2 NCs. Effective remove of the organic ligand capped on the surface of CuInS2 NCs could reduced the RS and RCT values. After ligand exchange or high temperature sintering, the RS and RCT values reduced to relatively low values, which are all similar to that of Pt CE. The RS value of Pt CE is the smallest, which is likely due to the more excellent conductivity of Pt than semiconductor CuInS2. The EIS results agreed well with the CV experiments.

Conclusions
In conclusion, inorganic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs were prepared through a ligand exchange strategy. After ligand exchange, the organic ligand capped on the surface of CuInS2 NCs were exchanged to inorganic ligand S2− without changing the shape, size distribution and crystal structure of the CuInS2 NCs. When the inorganic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs were used as a CE in the DSSC, the conversion efficiency of DSSCs can be significantly improved from 0.35% to 6.32%. After sintering at 500 °C, the conversion efficiency was further improved to 6.49%, which is comparable with that of Pt CE. With the aid of ligand exchange, the traditional process of high temperature sintering to remove organic ligands can be avoided. To the best of our knowledge, the use of inorganic ligand capped CuInS2 NCs films as potential substitutes for CEs of DSSCs has not been reported. The study in this work may pave a new pathway to explore highly electrically conductive materials for DSSCs.
