    AbstractThree new organic dyes that contain the dithienosilole (DTS) moiety as spacer have been synthesized and their photophysical/electrochemical properties, theoretical calculation and dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) performance have been investigated. The overall conversion efficiencies for DSSCs based on these dyes range from 6.73 to 7.50%, comparable to a (3–5′-[N,N-bis(9,9-dimethylfluorene-2-yl)phenyl]2,2′-bithiophene-5-yl}-2-cyanoacrylic acid (JK-2)-sensitized device (7.63%), fabricated and measured under the same experimental conditions. The DSSC constructed from one of the three compounds shows a higher open-circuit voltage (VOC) compared to those of the other two dye sensitized solar cells due to an increased electron lifetime (τe) in the conduction band of TiO2.
1. Introduction
Since Grätzel et al. first reported a highly efficient solar cell (more than 80% conversion efficiency for incident photon to electrical current) built from using a charge-transfer dye as sensitizer, nanocrystalline titanium oxide (TiO2) as electron transport layer and a redox electrolyte as the hole transport layer, dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) become an interesting research area to material chemists because dye molecules play a key role in the determination of photoconversion efficiency in DSSCs.1 Transition metal complexes containing ruthenium metal ion, such as cis-dithiocyanato-bis(4,4-dicarboxy-2,2-bipyridine)ruthenium(II) (N3), cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II) (N719) and (trithioxyanato-4,4′,4′′-tricarboxy-2,2′,2′′-terpyridine)ruthenium(II) (black dye), have been shown to be excellent dyes in DSSCs and their photoconversion efficiency is more than 10% under air mass 1.5 sunlight.2
Although Ru complexes have many advantages, there are still some problems to be solved in terms of high cost, preparation and purification. In this regard, organic sensitizers are recently considered as alternatives to Ru complexes. In general, organic sensitizers are composed of three segments, donor, spacer and acceptor/anchoring group. With the aim of increasing DSSC efficiency, several approaches on the development of organic sensitizers have been introduced. These include the introduction of varied functional groups, such as fluorene,3 coumarin,4 indoline,5 cyanine,6 perylene,7 triarylamine,8 and xanthene,9 to the donor part. On the contrary, the study on the control of spacer group has been much less investigated, yet our and Hara’s group recently suggested alkyl-functionalized organic dyes (MK-2, Chart 1) as spacers for the improvement of efficiency.10 In addition, molecular engineering to obtain red-shifted absorption spectra has been suggested for the extension of π-conjugation of spacers. Such representative examples are either the introduction of a methine unit into the spacer or modification of the thiophene spacer.11 Additional studies on the design and modification of organic dyes are the introduction of bulky groups in the spacer segment. A bulky substituent attached on the dye inhibits dye-aggregation as well as increasing electron lifetime (τe) of the dyes in the conduction band of TiO2, resulting in an increase of open-circuit voltage (Voc).

Five-membered heterocycles containing a silicon atom, siloles (silacyclopentadienes), have attracted current interest in material science because of their unique photophysical properties (σ*–π* conjugation).12 They possess not only low-lying LUMO energy levels compared with the cyclopentadiene analogues but also a two-order faster electron mobility than in Alq3 (q = 8-hydroxyquinolinato), which is often used as the electron-transporting material in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs).13 Among silole derivatives, dithienosiloles (DTSs) in which a 2,2′-bithiophene is bridged by a silicon atom at 3,3′-position show enlargement of π-conjugation of the bithiophene unit because the silicon bridge renders bithiophene coplanarity.14 For the achievement of highly efficient DSSC, organic dyes should have a strong absorption band from the visible to near IR region and an appropriate LUMO energy level should be secured in order to inject electrons effectively to the conduction band of TiO2 without any electron loss (recombination or reduction of electrolyte). In addition, organic dyes with highly π-conjugated systems from donor to acceptor segments are required for effective electron transfer (high dipole moment). Therefore, we envision that the introduction of a DTS moiety into the framework of organic dyes will be highly desirable. Moreover, there is no report on DSSC performance based on this kind of dyes until now. Only a few reports on the performance of polymeric solar cells using silole-based polymers have been published.15 These facts prompted us to develop new organic dyes containing the DTS moiety and investigate the effect of substituents at the 3-position of the DTS ring in DSSC performance. Herein, we describe the results of our investigation on the preparation, photophysical properties, electrochemical behavior, and DSSC performance of three novel DTS dyes.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Syntheses and characterization
Three new dithienosilole derivatives 7a–7c (see Scheme 1), have been synthesized for the present study. There are two key starting materials for the syntheses of each compound. The first is p-RC6H4Br where R = bis(9,9-dimethylfluoren-2-yl)amino, which was synthesized by using previously reported Ullmann condensation via the reaction of 4-bromoaniline with 2-iodo-9,9-dimethylfluorene in the presence of copper catalyst and a base.16 The second key starting materials are 3,3′-modified dithienosiloles (DTSs), such as 5,5′-dibromo-3,3′-dimethylsilylene-2,2′-bithiophene, 5,5′-dibromo-3,3′-methyl(phenyl)silylene-2,2′-bithiophene and 5,5′-dibromo-3,3′-diphenylsilylene-2,2′-bithiophene, which are synthesized by using a literature procedure.17 The three DTSs were obtained in moderate yields via two-step processes that involved first the Stille cross coupling of 5 with the corresponding bromoformylsiloles 3a–3c, followed by Knoevenagel condensation with cyanoacetic acid in the presence of a catalytic amount of piperidine in acetonitrile and chloroform, as shown in Scheme 1. The molecular structures of DTSs derivatives, 7a–7c, were confirmed using a variety of spectroscopic methods, such as NMR, mass and elemental analysis. All compounds are soluble in THF, CH2Cl2 and DMSO and fairly stable under air and moisture both in solution and in the solid state.

2.2 Optical and electrochemical properties

Fig. 1 shows the absorption and emission spectra of 7a–7c sensitizers measured in THF at ambient temperature.

The UV-vis spectra of all three DTSs 7a–7c exhibit two intense absorption bands in the longer wavelength region and their maximum values (λmax) are observed at 360–370 and 450–510 nm, respectively, as shown in Table 1. This absorption pattern is similar to that of JK-2, (3–5′-[N,N-bis(9,9-dimethylfluorene-2-yl)phenyl]2,2′-bithiophene-5-yl}-2-cyanoacrylic acid, which structurally closely resembles 7a–7c except for the spacer part. However, there is a big difference in molar extinction coefficient. For 7a–7c, the first band shows much stronger absorption than the second band. The difference of molar extinction coefficient between the two intense bands (λ = 364 and 452 nm) in JK-2 is ca. 5000 dm3 mol−1 cm−1, while DTSs show larger differences of molar extinction coefficient from 10000 to 20000 dm3 mol−1 cm−1. This observation can be due to the introduction of silole into the spacer moiety. In general, an intense absorption band of silole derivatives, which is attributed to the π–π* transition of the central five-membered silole ring, appears at 300–400 nm.18 Therefore, it can be assigned that the two intense absorption bands are attributable to the π–π* transition of the functionalized fluorene and of thiophene groups involving π–π* transitions of the thiophene-fused silole ring. Under the same conditions, compound 7a that contains a dimethyl moiety at the 3-position of dithienosilole ring exhibits a stronger and red-shifted absorption band at 504 nm (ε = 49000 dm3 mol−1 cm−1) as compared to the other DTS derivatives (7b and 7c) and even JK-2, indicating that the silole unit as spacer brings about effective π-conjugation throughout the sensitizers. In addition, this result implies that the DTS moiety has an influence on the electronic transition and that substituents at the 3-position of DTS ring also affect significantly the electronic transition. The absorption bands of the three DTSs dyes on a TiO2 electrode are relatively broadened and tail off at about 650 nm, which can account for the black color of the DTSs. Such broadening and red-shifted absorption have been reported in other organic dyes on TiO2 electrodes.19 In view of harvesting the solar energy and obtaining large photocurrent, these absorption spectra of the DTS dyes are highly desirable. Upon irradiation of UV light (354 nm), compounds 7a–7c display strong red emission in solution at ambient temperature. Interestingly, compound 7a emits at λmax = 670 nm, about 80 nm red-shifted, compared to that (λmax = 595 nm) of 7c, which can be clearly explained by the structural difference at the 3,3′-position of the DTS ring and electron-donating ability of the substituents between these two molecules. The emission spectra of 7a–7c indicate the possibility of tuning the luminescence of dyes by varying the substituent groups at the 3-position on the DTS ring. When the three dyes are adsorbed onto a nanocrystalline TiO2 film, the emission bands in the region of 500–800 nm were not observed. This observation suggests that the electron injection from an excited state of dye to TiO2 occurs efficiently.

To gain deeper insight into the geometrical configuration and the nature of luminescence displayed by 7a–7c, we carried out molecular orbital S0 → S1 excitation energy calculations for the three compounds in the gas phase using the Gaussian 03 package.20 The geometry optimizations in the ground state were performed at the density functional theory (DFT) level with the B3LYP exchange–correlation functional and a 3-21G* basis set. The molecular orbitals were obtained at the DFT level with the B3LYP/6-31G* method based on the optimized geometry of each compound. The vertical excitation energies were evaluated using time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) with the B3LYP/6-31G*. Fig. 2 shows optimized structure and the HOMO and LUMO levels of 7a–7c. The torsional angles between the phenyl ring attached to the nitrogen atom and the DTS plane in the optimized structures of 7a–7c are 23.7, 25.7 and 26.0°, respectively. Due to the phenyl groups attached to the 3-position of the DTS ring, the torsional angles in 7b and 7c are slightly larger than in 7a. Based on the calculation, we found that the phenyl ring attached on the nitrogen atom is almost coplanar with the DTS ring, leading to effective π-conjugation throughout the molecules

Fig. 3 presents the isodensity plots of the frontier molecular orbitals of 7a–7c. The HOMO levels of the dye molecules are mainly dominated by a π orbital contribution of the 3–5′-N,N-bis(9,9-dimethylfluorene-2-yl)phenyl unit with a small contribution from the DTS ring π orbital, while the HOMO−1 levels are a π orbital delocalized mainly over the DTS ring with a small contribution from the 3–5′-N,N-bis(9,9-dimethylfluorene-2-yl)phenyl unit. The LUMO levels are largely π* with dominating contributions from the DTS ring and the cyanoacrylic groups and the LUMO+1 levels are also π* mainly delocalized across the DTS ring and the cyanoacrylic groups. The HOMO−1, HOMO and LUMO of 7a–7c have shapes similar to those of JK-1, while the LUMO+1 are very different from that of JK-1. (In the case of JK-1, the LUMO+1 level is dominated by fluorene based π* orbitals.) This result implies that the DTS ring has a great deal of influence on even the LUMO+1 level as well as the LUMO level.
 Fig. 3  Isodensity surface plots of the HOMO−1, HOMO, LUMO and LUMO+1 of the three dyes (isodensity contour = 0.03 a.u.). 

Table 1 shows the calculated S0 → S1 vertical excitation energies along with the oscillator strength and the transition orbitals having the maximum CI coefficients for dyes 7a–7c. The calculated excitation energies are also compared with the experimental absorption maxima. The transition orbitals and considerable magnitude of oscillator strengths as well as the isodensity surface plots of the HOMO and LUMO indicate that the measured absorption and emission of compounds 7a–7c are originated from π→π* transitions between the 3–5′-N,N-bis(9,9-dimethylfluorene-2-yl)phenyl group and the cyanoacrylic group with a contribution of the DTS ring. As compared to the red shift from 7b to 7a through 7c observed in the experimental absorption band, the calculated excitation energies are almost the same for the three compounds. This difference may result from the fact that the measurements of the absorption spectra were carried out in THF, whereas the excitation energy calculations were performed in vacuo. Another difference is a longer wavelength of the calculated excitation energy than that of the experimental absorption maximum. This difference is related to the limitation in TDDFT calculation using the current exchange–correlation functional, which gives substantial errors for excited states of molecules with extended π-systems such as compounds 7a–7c.21 Based on these results, we believe that the absorption and emission of compounds 7a–7c are originated from N,N-bis(9,9-dimethylfluorene-2-yl)phenyl- and cyanoacrylic group-based π–π* transitions with the contribution of the DTS ring. In addition, this result for the change of electron distribution in HOMO and LUMO level supports an efficient charge separation of the DTS dyes.
To estimate the feasibility of electron transfer from the excited state of the dyes to the conduction band of TiO2 electrode, we carried out cyclic voltammetry experiments in order to determine the redox potentials (Table 2). The redox potentials of the three DTS dyes, 7a–7c were measured in CH3CN with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate. TiO2 films coated with the sensitizers were used as working electrodes. The both 7a and 7c dyes adsorbed on TiO2 films show a single reversible oxidation at 1.06 V (vs. NHE). The separation potentials between the anodic peak (Epa) and cathodic peak (Epc) for 7a and 7c are 0.22 and 0.17 V, respectively. This reversible process can be assigned to the oxidation of the N,N-bis(9,9-dimethylfluorene-2-yl)phenyl group, as supported by our previous report.22 Interestingly, 7b dye adsorbed on TiO2 films shows a double reversible oxidation at 1.07 and 1.59 V (vs NHE), respectively, as shown in Fig. 4.

The first oxidation at low potential is similar to those of 7a and 7c, thus it can be assigned to the oxidation of the same donor group. Based on previous reports on the electrochemical behaviors of DTS derivatives,23 the second oxidation is likely due to the DTS and phenyl substituents. The reduction potentials of three dyes calculated from the oxidation potentials and the E0−0 determined from the intersection of absorption and emission spectra are listed in Table 1. The LUMO energies of 7a, 7b and 7c are −1.05, −1.20 and −1.26 (vs. NHE), respectively. These energies are much lower than those of even JK-6 (3.3.6.5-{5′-[N,N-bis(9,9-dimethylfluorene-2-yl)phenyl]-2,2′-bisthiophene-5-yl}-2-cyanopenta-2,4-dienoic acid), which contains a highly π-conjugated methine unit as spacer.24 This lowering of LUMO energies are originated from the full conjugation between donor and spacer group and are typical characteristics resulting from the silole ring of the DTS unit.25 Moreover, highly negative LUMO levels also permit the electron in the excited state of dye to be effectively injected the conduction band of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE).
2.3 DSSC performance
To compare the DSSC performances of DTS dyes, we also fabricated a DSSC based on JK-2. These contained a similar structure under the same experimental conditions. Details for the fabrication of DSSCs are described in the Experimental section and photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs based on DTS dyes and JK-2 dye are summarized in Table 2.

Fig. 5 shows the action spectra of monochromatic incident-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) for DSSCs based on DTS dyes and JK-2. The onset wavelengths of IPCE spectra for DSSCs based on 7b and 7c are 750 and 765 nm, respectively. The onset wavelength of the 7a sensitized cell is 750 nm, which is comparable to those of N3 (cis-dithiocyanato-bis(4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine)ruthenium(II)) and MK-2 (2-cyano-3-[5′′′-(9-ethyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)-3′,3′′,3′′′,4-tetra-n-hexyl[2,2′,5′,2′′,5′′,2′′′]quaterthiophenyl-5-yl]acrylic acid) sensitized cells.10a, 26 The 7a sensitizer IPCE spectrum is red-shifted by about 20–40 nm as compared to 7b and 7c, which is consistent with the absorption spectrum of dye 7a. The observed IPCE value for the DSSCs based on 7a, 7b and 7c is more than 70% in the region of 400–620 nm (maximum value, 7a: 91% at 500 nm; 7b: 90% at 490 nm; 7c: 92% at 490 nm), indicating the highly efficient DSSCs performance.
 Fig. 5  Action spectra of incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for DSSCs based on DTS dyes 7a–7c and JK-2 under the same conditions. 
Under standard global AM (Air Mass) 1.5 solar condition, the 7b (DTS-Ph2) sensitized cell gave a short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 13.9 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.74 V, and a fill factor of 0.73, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency η, derived from the equation JscVocff/light intensity, of 7.50% (see Fig. 6). This conversion efficiency is comparable to that of the JK-2 based DSSC (7.63%). By contrast, the conversion efficiencies of 7a and 7c based DSSCs are 6.73 and 6.81%, respectively, which are slightly lower than that of the JK-2 sensitized cell under the same condition (Jsc:15.1 mA cm−2, Voc: 0.65 V, ff: 0.69 for 7a; Jsc: 14.7 mA cm−2, Voc: 0.64 V, ff: 0.72 for 7c). The better Jsc of DTS dyes than that of JK-2 implies that the electron injection to the conduction band of TiO2 occurs easily due to the diminution of LUMO energy. It is noteworthy that the Voc for the DSSC based on 7b sensitizer, which contains bulky phenyl groups at the 3-position of DTS ring, is higher than those for 7a and 7c. In general, the Voc value is quite sensitive to the electron lifetime (τe) in the conduction band of TiO2.27 Henceforth, we carried out measurements of electron lifetime in accordance with the measured diffusion coefficient for the three dyes in order to understand the reason 7b has a high Voc value. Fig. 6 shows the electron diffusion coefficients and lifetimes of the DSSCs employing different dyes (i.e.7a, 7b, 7c and JK-2) displayed as a function of Jsc. No significant differences among the De values were seen at the identical short-circuit current conditions, showing the similar trend to those of coumarin dyes.28 The result means that the De values are hardly affected by structural changes in the dye molecules. On the other hand, the τe values show a significant gap among the dyes, resulting in the increasing order of 7b > 7a > 7c. The introduction of methyl or phenyl groups into Si may affect the aggregation among the dye molecules. As a result, the τe values varied with the aggregation tendency. In terms of molecular structure, bulky phenyl groups attached on the DTS ring prevent molecular aggregation, leading to decreased intermolecular energy transfer and extended excited lifetime of molecules. This also prevents recombination and diminishes the dark current. The results of the electron lifetime are well consistent with those of the Jsc shown in Fig. 7 and Table 2.

3. Conclusion
We have synthesized a new class of organic dyes featuring dithienosilole with varied substituents at 3-position as a spacer. The performance of DSSCs achieved from this new series of dyes is highly efficient. In addition, one of the three dyes, which has diphenyl substituents at the 3-position of the dithienosilole ring, exhibits higher conversion efficiency as compared to the other two dyes (i.e. dimethyl or methylphenyl substituents introduced into the same position of dithienosilole) and the conversion efficiency is comparable to that of JK-2 dye. In terms of molecular structure, 7b has higher Voc than other dyes because molecular aggregation is prevented due to the introduction of bulky phenyl groups in the spacer. Therefore, introducing bulky groups into spacers makes Voc of molecules controllable and enables DSSCs to be highly efficient. Further study based on this consideration is currently in progress.
4. Experimental
Materials and characterization
All reagents were purchased from commercial sources and without further purification unless otherwise noted. All solvents were freshly distilled from appropriate drying agents prior to use. Conventional Schlenk techniques were used, and reactions were carried out under Ar unless otherwise noted. 1H NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker Avance 300 MHz or 400 MHz spectrometer. The absorption and photoluminescence spectra were recorded on a Perkin–Elmer Lambda 2S UV–Visible spectrometer and a Perkin LS fluorescence spectrometer, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry was carried out with a BAS 100B (Bioanalytical Systems, Inc.). A three-electrode system was used and consisted of a gold disk, working electrode, and a platinum wire electrode. Redox potentials of dyes on TiO2 were measured in CH3CN with 0.1 M (n-C4H9)4NPF6 with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1.
The π-conjugated spacers 1a–1c25 and the key starting material, N-(4-bromophenyl)-N,N-bis(9,9-dimethylfluoren-2-yl)amine, were prepared as described in the literature.29
Cell fabrication
FTO glass plates (Pilkington TEC Glass-TEC 8, Solar 2.3 mm thickness) were cleaned in a detergent solution using an ultrasonic bath for 30 min, and rinsed with water and ethanol. The FTO glass plates were immersed in 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 min and washed with water and ethanol. A transparent nanocrystalline layer on the FTO glass plate was prepared by doctor blade printing TiO2 paste (Solaronix, Ti-Nanoxide T/SP) and then dried for 2 h at 25 °C. The TiO2 electrodes were gradually heated under an air flow at 325 °C for 5 min, at 375 °C for 5 min, at 450 °C for 15 min, and at 500 °C for 15 min. The thickness of the transparent layer was measured by using an Alpha-step 250 surface profilometer (Tencor Instruments, San Jose, CA), a paste for the scattering layer containing 400 nm sized anatase particles (CCIC, PST-400C) was deposited by doctor blade printing and then dried for 2 h at 25 °C. The TiO2 electrodes were gradually heated under an air flow at 325 °C for 5 min, at 375 °C for 5 min, at 450 °C for 15 min, and at 500 °C for 15 min. The resulting layer was composed of 10 μm thickness of transparent layer and 4 μm thickness of scattering layer. The TiO2 electrodes were treated again by TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 min and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. The TiO2 electrodes were immersed into JK-2, DTS-Me2 (7a), DTS-Ph2 (7b) or DTS-MePh (7c) (0.3 mM in EtOH containing 10 mM 3α,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholic acid (Cheno)) and kept at room temperature for 12 h. The FTO plate (Pilkington TEC Glass-TEC 8, Solar 2.3 mm thickness) for the counter electrodes was cleaned successively with an ultrasonic bath in H2O, acetone and 0.1 M HCl(aq). Counter electrodes were prepared by coating with a drop of H2PtCl6 solution (2 mg of Pt in 1 mL of ethanol) on a FTO plate and heating at 400 °C for 15 min. The dye adsorbed TiO2 electrode and Pt-counter electrode were assembled into a sealed sandwich-type cell by heating at 80 °C with a hot-melt ionomer film (Surlyn SX 1170–25, Solaronix) as a spacer between the electrodes. A drop of electrolyte solution (electrolyte of 0.6 M DMPImI, 0.05 M iodine, 0.1 M LiI and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile) was placed on the drilled hole in the counter electrode of the assembled cell and was driven into the cell via vacuum backfilling. Finally, the hole was sealed using additional Surlyn and a cover glass (0.1 mm thickness).
Characterization of DSSCs
The cells were measured using a 1000 W xenon light source, whose power of an AM 1.5 Oriel solar simulator was calibrated by using a KG5 filtered Si reference solar cell. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra for the cells were measured on an IPCE measuring system (PV measurements).
Electron transport measurement
The electron diffusion coefficient (De) and lifetimes (τe) in TiO2 photoelectrodes were measured by the stepped light-induced transient measurements of photocurrent and voltage (SLIM-PCV).30 The transients were induced by a stepwise change in the laser intensity. A diode laser (λ = 635 nm) as a light source was modulated using a function generator. The initial laser intensity was a constant 90 mW cm−2 and was attenuated up to approximately 10 mW cm−2 using a ND filter which was positioned at the front side of the fabricated samples (TiO2 film thickness ca. 10 μm; active area = 0.04 cm2). The photocurrent and photovoltage transients were monitored using a digital oscilloscope through an amplifier. The De value was obtained by a time constant (τc) determined by fitting a decay of the photocurrent transient with exp(−t/τc) and the TiO2 film thickness (ω) using the equation, De = ω2/(2.77τc).28 The τe value was also determined by fitting a decay of photovoltage transient with exp(−t/τe). All experiments were conducted at room temperature.
