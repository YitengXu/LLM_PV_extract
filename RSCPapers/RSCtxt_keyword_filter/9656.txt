    , Accepted 26th February 2021First published on 9th March 2021AbstractLead halide perovskite (LHP) has gained tremendous attention from both academia and industry due to its excellent optical and electrical properties. To date, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a small area LHP solar cell has reached 25.5%. However, lead (Pb2+) element in perovskite compounds is toxic and harmful to the environment and human health. Additionally, LHP exhibits a larger energy bandgap (Eg) that is not within the optimal range in the Shockley–Queisser (S–Q) maximum efficiency limit, which has further limited the maximum attainability of the device performance. In order to reduce Pb2+ concentration in perovskite compounds and alter Eg close to the optimal range S–Q efficiency limit, tin (Sn2+) has been proposed to fully or partially substitute Pb2+ due to their similar ionic radii and outer electronic configurations. Even though the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of Sn2+ and mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have seen rapid improvement in recent years, they are still far behind that of Pb2+ PSCs because the high number of defects in Sn2+ based halide perovskites induces poor morphology and poor optoelectronic properties in the perovskite films. Therefore, in this review, we will provide the challenging issues of Sn2+ halide perovskites and methodologies (i.e. device engineering) to boost the efficiency and stability of Sn2+ and mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ based single-junction PSCs. At the same time, we also show future perspectives and remaining challenges in this field, with an aim to help further progression of efficient and stable Sn2+ and mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ PSCs.

Broader context
Solar energy has the potential to fix the fast-rising energy demand problem because it is free and abundant. New novel solar harvesting materials for the next generation photovoltaic technology such as thin film photovoltaic, dye-sensitized photovoltaic, quantum-dot photovoltaic, organic photovoltaic and perovskite photovoltaic technologies have been widely investigated from around the world. Among them, perovskite photovoltaic technology has attracted tremendous attention owing to the rapid development in both efficiency and stability achieved in recent years. However, the lead (Pb2+) halide perovskite absorber layer is not only toxic, but also exhibits a larger energy bandgap. Because tin (Sn2+) can fully or partially substitute in the Pb2+ halide perovskite structure with negligible perovskite lattice perturbations, a Pb2+-free or low Pb2+ halide perovskite absorber layer with a narrower energy band gap that is close to the optimal range in the Shockley–Queisser maximum efficiency limit can be achieved. Herein, the challenging issues of Sn2+ based halide perovskites and the device engineering of Sn2+ and mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ halide perovskites are reviewed and summarized. Finally, future prospects and remaining challenges are presented to help further progression of efficient Sn2+-based photovoltaic technology.

1. Introduction
Since the finding that LHP could serve as a light sensitizer in solar cells by Miyasaka and co-workers in 2009, it then has emerged as a revolutionary light-harvesting material for solar cell application.1 Till now, the record PCE of Pb2+ PSC has reached 25.5%,2 thanks to its excellent optical and electrical properties, including tunable Eg,3 a high light absorption coefficient up to 105 cm−1,4 a long carrier diffusion length of 100 nm to 1000 nm5,6 and a low exciton binding energy of 2 to 55 meV.7,8 Although the LHP absorber layer enables highly efficient solar cells2 with superior stability up to one year,9 it contains Pb2+ element which is toxic and harmful to the environment and human health, as described elsewhere in previous works.10–12 For example, methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) can decompose to PbI2 carcinogen when it comes in contact with polar solvents such as water,13 which can inevitably accumulate within the food chain and finally into the human body. Meanwhile, the Eg of LHP which is larger than 1.5 eV is not within the optimal range S–Q limit.14,15 As a result, the Pb2+ element in perovskite compounds might hamper the practicality of solar cells. Thus, adding Sn2+ element in LHP, either to bring the Eg close to the optimal range S–Q efficiency limit for singe junction cells16 or as the rear/bottom cell in perovskite–perovskite tandem solar cells17 (i.e. mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ as the rear/bottom cell & LHP as the front/top cell), are two important factors to achieve less toxic and highly efficient PSCs. Additionally, the Eg of mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ halide perovskites can be tuned from 1.6 eV to 1.2 eV,18 making them suitable to act as effective absorber layers for single-junction devices. At present, various elements such as Sn2+, bismuth (Bi3+), germanium (Ge2+), antimony (Sb3+), and copper (Cu2+) have been used to replace Pb2+.19 Among these elements, Sn2+ has similar ionic radius (i.e. Sn2+ = 1.15 Å; Pb2+ = 1.19 Å) and outer electronic configurations of ns2np2 to those of Pb2+ element.20,21 As such, it can completely or partially substitute Pb2+ in the LHP structure with negligible lattice perturbations. More importantly, Sn2+ halide perovskite has a narrower Eg and a higher carrier mobility (i.e. electron mobility of >2000 cm2 V−1 s−1 and hole mobility of >300 cm2 V−1 s−1) compared to Pb2+ based counterparts.22,23 Thus, Sn2+ halide perovskite is still considered as the most promising alternative to Pb2+ halide perovskite, even though there are some serious concerns regarding its suitability, as discussed in detail by Conings et al.11,24 and Krebs et al.25
In 2012, Chen et al.26 first fabricated CsSnI3 Schottky solar cells and achieved a PCE of 0.9%. In 2014, Noel et al.27 reported regular mesoporous MASnI3 PSCs and achieved a PCE of nearly 6.4%, but with poor reproducibility. After this, device engineering with various approaches has been carried out to optimize the performance and stability of Sn2+ and mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ halide perovskite devices.28–30 More recently, Liu et al.31 have reported that the organic halide salt n-propylammonium iodide (PAI) layer on the FASnI3 film could improve device performance up to 11.78%, with a certified PCE of 11.22%. Nishimura et al.32 constructed two dimensional/three dimensional (2D/3D) Sn2+ PSCs and achieved a PCE of 13.24% by adding 10% ethylammonium iodide (EAI) in the GeI2 doped FA0.98EDA0.01SnI3 film. Meanwhile, mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ halide perovskites have also exhibited significant advances in single-junction device applications due to their optimal Eg of 1.6 eV to 1.2 eV.18 In 2014, Ogomi et al.33 demonstrated that the MASn0.5Pb0.5I3 film has a narrower Eg with an absorption onset at 1060 nm and exhibited a PCE of 4.18%. A few years later, Lin et al.34 reported a high PCE of 21.1% for the MA0.3FA0.7Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 film as the absorber layer, achieved by utilizing metallic Sn2+ powder to reduce Sn2+ vacancies via a comproportionation reaction.
In this review, we summarize the challenging issues of Sn2+ based halide perovskites and present methodologies (i.e. device engineering) to boost the efficiency and stability of single-junction Sn2+ and mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ PSCs. We start with the fundamental knowledge of PSCs, followed by the optoelectronic properties of Sn2+ based halide perovskites and perovskite film fabrication methods. Thereafter, we discuss the issues of Sn2+ based halide perovskites and methodologies (i.e. device engineering) to improve the device performance and its stability. At last, we provide the future prospects and remaining challenges in this field to help further progression for efficient Sn2+ and mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ PSCs.
2. Fundamental understanding of perovskite solar cells
2.1 How do perovskite solar cells work?
The pioneering work of PSCs is developed from dye-sensitized solar cells.1 As shown in Fig. 1a, free electrons are excited to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level after photon absorption by dye molecules. Then, it would be injected into the conduction band minimum (CBM) of titanium dioxide (TiO2), followed by extraction of electrons to the working electrode (WE). The electrons would flow through the external circuit to the counter electrode (CE) and finally reach the iodide electrolyte solution, whereby electrons combine with the oxidized species in the iodide electrolyte solution. The electrolyte would regenerate and transport electrons back to the dye molecules. Owing to the dissolution issue of LHP in the liquid electrolyte which could affect the device stability,35 the liquid electrolyte is then replaced by the solid state 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) hole transporting layer (HTL).36,37 In the case of PSCs, the perovskite layer is an intrinsic semiconductor (i.e. neither n-type nor p-type) and is sandwiched between the electron transporting layer (ETL) and HTL. Due to the weak binding energy of the excitons in the perovskite material (i.e. typically in the range of 2–55 meV),7,8 the free electrons/holes formed inside the perovskite layer after photon absorption can be immediately injected to the ETL/HTL with very slow free charge carrier recombination. Finally, the free electrons and free holes are extracted to the cathode and anode, respectively (Fig. 1b).

2.2 Architecture design of perovskite solar cells
The architecture of PSCs is illustrated in Fig. 2. Basically, PSCs can be classified into mesoporous and planar architectures, either in regular (n–i–p) or in inverted (p–i–n) structure, depending on the positions of the ETL and HTL in the device. In the early days of PSC research, the device is focused on mesoporous n–i–p structure. The perovskite layer is deposited on mesoporous TiO2 or insulating mesoporous aluminium oxide (Al2O3), leading to an intermixed layer. The HTL and metallic anode are then sequentially deposited on top of the perovskite layer to complete the device fabrication. The function of the mesoporous layer is to reduce the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) hysteresis phenomenon and improves charge extraction in PSCs.38,39 Certified PCEs of >20% have been attained based on mesoporous n–i–p structure.40–42 Owing to the long diffusion lengths of perovskite semiconductors (i.e. >100 nm),5,6 researchers propose planar n–i–p structure by removing the mesoporous layer. In 2012, Snaith et al.37 first fabricated planar n–i–p PSCs with compact TiO2 as the ETL but achieved a low PCE of <2%. It should be noted that the ETL43 or HTL44,45 can be avoided during the device fabrication for certain n–i–p structure. For the device with inverted (p–i–n) structure, the ETL and HTL are reversed with respect to the n–i–p structure. The device is often constructed using a planar and compact HTL, such as conductive poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), inorganic p-type semiconductor (i.e. nickel oxide (NiOx), copper thiocyanate (CuSCN), copper oxide (Cu2O), copper iodide (CuI), vanadium pentoxide (V2O5)) and graphene derivatives46 on top of a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) substrate. In 2013, Guo et al.47 first fabricated planar p–i–n PSCs with compact PEDOT:PSS as the HTL and achieved a PCE of 3.9%. Meanwhile, the device without the HTL but with a high PCE of >20% has also been reported for planar type p–i–n structure.48

2.3 Crystal structure of halide perovskites
The general crystal structure of halide perovskites is ABX3. Here, A represents a monovalent organic or inorganic cation, such as methylammonium (MA+), formamidinium (FA+) or caesium (Cs+), B represents a divalent metallic cation (i.e. Pb2+ or Sn2+) and X represents a halide anion (i.e. iodide (I−), bromide (Br−) or chloride (Cl−)).49 An ideal ABX3 perovskite structure usually has cubic symmetry with each cation B having six nearest-neighbour anions X (BX6-octahedra) and the cuboctahedral void is occupied by the A-site cation (Fig. 3a).50 It is stable in cubic structure when the Goldschmidt tolerance factor, t = (rA + rX)/{√2(rB + rX)}, is in the range of 0.80 < t < 1.0, where rA, rB and rX are the effective ionic radii of the A, B and X ions, respectively. If t < 0.80, it tends to form less symmetric tetragonal or orthorhombic structures because the A-site cation is too small; if t > 1, it forms a hexagonal structure, indicating that the A-site cation is too large and precludes perovskite formation.20,51,52 Recently, the oxidation state of organic or inorganic cation, nA, has been introduced in the tolerance factor, with the new formula of τ = (rx/rB) − nA[nA − {(rA/rB)/ln(rA/rB)}].53 Similar to t, the prediction of perovskite stability using τ requires only the chemical composition, allowing the tolerance factor to be agnostic to the many structures that are considered perovskite. Meanwhile, τ also provides a monotonic estimate of the probability that a material is stable in the perovskite structure. It should be noted that rA is larger than rB by definition and it is in perovskite structure if τ < 4.18. In addition, τ is more accurate than t to predict the stability of the perovskite structure, as described in ref. 53. In addition, the annealing temperature might be also important for the formability and stability of perovskite structure.23,54

Meanwhile, the 3D structure of the halide perovskite can also be tuned to low dimensional 2D (or quasi-2D structure) by inserting a large organic cation. There are three types of 2D perovskite, namely (i) Ruddlesden–Popper (R–P) (Fig. 3b) with the phase formula of A′2An−1BnX3n+1, (ii) Dion–Jacobson (D–J) (Fig. 3c) with the phase formula of A′′An−1BnX3n+1 and (iii) alternating cation in the interlayer space (ACI) with the phase formula of A′′AnBnX3n+1. Interestingly, ACI combines the stacking characteristics of both R–P and D–J structural types (Fig. 3d). The A-site cation (i.e. MA+, FA+, Cs+) not only resides in the perovskite slab but also fills in the interlayer along with the designated spacing cation A. Here, A′ and A′′ represent monovalent (+1) and divalent (+2) aromatic or aliphatic alkyl ammonium spacer cations, respectively, whereas n represents the number of octahedral sheets (i.e. number of 2D layers) sandwiched between two organic interlayers.55–57
3. Optoelectronic properties of Sn2+ based halide perovskites
3.1 Optical absorption
As discussed in Section 2.3, the crystal structure of 3D halide perovskites is ABX3. Therefore, the absorption of Sn2+ based halide perovskite films is dependent on the A-site cation, X-site anion and dopant material in the ABX3 crystal lattice. Although the absorption coefficient of Sn2+ halide perovskite (i.e. ≈104 cm−1)58 is one order of magnitude lower than that of LHP (i.e. ≈105 cm−1),4 it exhibits better optical properties than Pb2+-analogues.27 For example, the absorption edge of the MAPbI3 film was 800 nm.33 By incorporating Sn2+ in the MAPbI3 lattice, the absorption edge of the MASnxPb1−xI3 films could shift from 1000 nm to 1200 nm when x was varied from 0.3 to 1.0.33 In contrast, the dopant material in the A-site or X-site of the ABX3 lattice could shift the absorption edge either towards (i.e. (A-site: FA+ and Cs+);59,60 (X-site: BF4− or SCN−)61,62) or away (i.e. (A-site: PPA+ and {en} cation);63,64 (X-site: Br−)65–68) from the infrared region. For the 2D Sn2+ or mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ halide perovskite film, the absorption edge is shifted to the infrared region with increasing number to 2D layers, from n = 1 (i.e. 2D) to n = ∞ (i.e. 3D).69–71 It should be noted that if the perovskite film has a wider absorption range (i.e. up to the near infrared region (NIR)), it can absorb more sunlight radiation, yielding a high photocurrent density in PSCs.
3.2 Effective mass
It is well known that the carrier mobility of the perovskite film can influence device performance, which is also related to the effective mass of the free charge carriers. Generally, the electron and/or hole effective masses can be written as m* = ℏ2*((κ)/δκ2), where (κ) and κ are the band eigenvalue and wave vector, respectively.72 Using the SOC-DFT method, Mosconi et al.73 demonstrated that the effective electron and hole masses of the MAPbI3 film were smaller than those of the MASnI3 film. However, it exhibited intermediate and balanced electron and hole masses values after Sn2+ was introduced in MAPbI3 lattice (i.e. MAPb1−xSnxI3). In contrast, Xian et al.74 reported that Sn2+ in CsPbBr3 significantly reduced the carrier effective masses of CsPb1−xSnxBr3 films. Meanwhile, external strain has also been utilized to reduce the electron effective mass of Sn2+ halide perovskite.75 Owing to its small carrier effective mass and weak electron–phonon/hole–phonon coupling,76 LHP exhibited a lower carrier mobility than Sn2+ based halide perovskites.23 Thus, a high PCE with better carrier transport can be expected for Sn2+ based halide PSCs.
3.3 Electronic structure
Theoretical studies reveal that the CBMs of ASnX3 (APb1−xSnxX3) films are formed by the p orbital of the B-site cation (p orbital of the B-site cation and p-orbital of the X-site anion), whereas the valence band maxima (VBMs) of ASnX3 (APb1−xSnxX3) films are formed by the s orbital of the B-site cation and/or the p orbital of the X-site anion.76–80 Even though the A-site cation has rarely contributed to the electronic structure around the band gap, it affects the perovskite lattice structure. Furthermore, when it is placed in certain directions, it brings about a non-centro-symmetric lattice.76 Therefore, the electronic transport properties of Sn2+ based halide perovskite films are highly dependent on the B-site divalent cation and X-site halide anion. As shown in Fig. 4, the binding strengths of Sn2+(s) and Sn2+(p) atomic orbitals are less than those of the corresponding Pb2+ state. Thus, the energy band edges of MASnI3 are bound less strongly than those of Pb2+-analogues, resulting in a reduction in the Eg of the MASnI3 film.79 Similar results (i.e. lower Eg) were obtained for FASnI3 and CsSnI3 films.22 Furthermore, it has also been reported that the band structure and Eg of ASnX3 films can be altered through composition engineering in the A-site cation and X-site anion.65,81

To date, the mechanism bandgap of the ‘bowing-effect’ of mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ halide perovskite is still under debate and is opposed to Vegard's law.18 Most of the theoretical and experimental works reveal that the pronounced band gap behaviour in mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ halide perovskite can be attributed to the following reasons: (i) upward VBM shifts are greater than CBM shifts with a change in x33; (ii) the short-range ordering of Pb2+ and Sn2+ atoms in the alloys82; (iii) chemical defects due to energy mismatch between Pb2+ and Sn2+ atomic orbitals from the band edge of this alloy. The VBM is derived from the interaction between Sn2+(s) and I−(p) orbitals, whereas the CBM is derived from Pb2+(p) and I−(p) orbitals (Fig. 4)79; and (iv) competition between spin–orbit coupling (SOC) and lattice distortion.74,83
4. How to make Sn2+ based halide perovskite layers?
4.1 Spin-coating method
Spin-coating is a common method for the deposition of Sn2+ based halide perovskite films. Generally, it can be divided into two ways, namely one-step method and two-step sequential deposition method. In the one-step method, the Sn2+ based halide perovskite (i.e. ASnX3 or APb1−xSnxX3) precursor solution obtained using N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is spin-coated on the carrier transporting layer (CTL) surface, followed by low-temperature heat-treatment to improve the crystal quality of the film, as shown in Fig. 5a. With the assistance of an antisolvent (Fig. 5b) such as chlorobenzene (CBZ), toluene (TL), or diethyl ether (DE) during the spinning process, a flat and high-quality perovskite film can be obtained. In the two-step sequential deposition method, the Sn2+ halide material (i.e. SnX2) or mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ halide material (Pb1−xSnxX2), where X = I−, Br− or Cl−, in DMF or DMSO solvent is first spin-coated on top of the CTL surface. Then, an organic or inorganic halide (i.e. MAI, FAI or CsI) is dropped on the prepared film using isopropyl alcohol (IPA) (Fig. 5c). Finally, the stacked two layers are subjected to low-temperature heat treatment. The conversion process is a heterogeneous reaction wherein two components inter-diffuse into each other to form an ASnX3 or APb1−xSnxX3 perovskite layer.84 However, this method has rarely been reported for ASnX3 PSCs85 because the high solubility of SnX2 in IPA solution makes it difficult to process ASnX3 perovskite films.86,87 In contrast, mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ perovskite films obtained using the two-step sequential deposition method have shown encouraging results. It forms a larger perovskite grain size and enables homogeneous transformation to the mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ hybrid perovskite crystallites.88,89 Liu et al.90 claimed that the two-step sequential deposition method is more favourable to prepare Pb2+ rich mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ perovskite films.

4.2 All vapour deposition method in vacuum conditions
Since the first pioneering work on vapour deposited PSCs in 2013,91 it then has garnered attention because the perovskite films prepared using the vapour method exhibit more uniformity, higher homogeneity and better surface coverage compared to solution-derived films. In addition, the vacuum conditions adopted during the vapour deposition process are also beneficial for air-sensitive Sn2+ based halide perovskite films. Until now, MASnI3,92 MASnBr3,93 CsSnBr3,94 FA0.979Cs0.021Sn0.968Pb0.032I3,95 FAPb0.5Sn0.5I396 and MA0.9Cs0.1Sn0.25Pb0.75I397 films have been successfully fabricated by the vacuum vapour deposition method. Yu et al.92 utilized the thermal evaporation method to prepare the MASnI3 film and achieved high surface coverage, compact morphology and strong crystallographic preferred orientation along the 〈100〉 direction, yielding a PCE of 1.7%. In the same year, Jung et al.93 used co-evaporation and sequential deposition evaporation methods to prepare the MASnBr3 film. The authors found that the device prepared using the latter method gave a higher PCE of 1.2%, which could be attributed to the fact that the top layer of the MABr film during the second deposition process could act as a protective layer and prevent the direct exposure of the Sn2+ containing layer to ambient air. Later, Moghe et al.94 fabricated CsSnBr3 PSCs via all vapour deposition and achieved a PCE of ≈0.6%. Ball et al.95 used a mixture formed by melting all metal halides (i.e. Cs+, Pb2+ and Sn2+ cations) as a single crucible to co-evaporate with FAI to form the FA0.979Cs0.021Sn0.968Pb0.032I3 film. The incorporation of SnF2 into the melt helped to regulate the perovskite optoelectronic properties and a PCE of ≈10% was obtained. Igual-Muñoz et al.96 fabricated the FAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 film using thermal vacuum deposition of SnI2, SnF2, FAI and PbI2 precursors and achieved a PCE of 13.98%. Later, the same group reported that an optimum thickness of ≈600 nm was achieved for the vacuum deposited MA0.9Cs0.1Sn0.25Pb0.75I3 film, with the best PCE of 8.89% in the absence of SnF2.97
4.3 Vapour-assisted solution processing method
The method of vapour assisted solution processing was first proposed in 2014 to construct high quality perovskite films for solar cell application.98 In 2018, Zhu et al.99 proposed an evaporation-assisted solution (EAS) method to fabricate CsSnI3 films (Fig. 6a). Initially, a perovskite precursor solution containing mixed Sn2+ halide materials (i.e. SnI2 and SnF2) was deposited on the substrate surface using the spin-coating method. After annealing, the sample was transferred to a vacuum chamber for the CsI deposition process. Because SnI2 and CsI were hard to diffuse in order to form the CsSnI3 film at room temperature, a yellowish film was formed (Fig. 6b). Therefore, the annealing process at elevated temperatures was applied to drive the sufficient inter-diffusion of each component layer to form a black mirror like CsSnI3 film (Fig. 6c). In this work, the optimized device achieved a PCE of 2.23%, which could be attributed to the fact that the derived CsSnI3 film was highly uniform, dense and pinhole free. Later, Xi et al.100 used a similar method to prepare FASnI3 films. A mixed precursor solution of FAI:PEDOT:PSS was deposited on a PEDOT:PSS substrate using the spin-coating method. After annealing, a SnI2 layer was evaporated on the prepared film. Because the PEDOT:PSS could restrain tiny FAI crystals and provide various inter-diffusion pathways for the FAI to react with SnI2, the optimized device obtained using FAI:20% PEDOT:PSS achieved a PCE of 3.98%. Meanwhile, the EAS method has also been used to fabricate 2D/3D Sn2+ halide perovskite films.101 Initially, the FAI film was fabricated using the spin-coating method, followed by the thermal evaporation of PEAI molecules on the FAI film to form a PEAI/FAI mixture. Eventually, a SnI2 layer was deposited on top of it. Because the evaporated PEAI improved the film morphology with a smaller number of pinholes, the device obtained using a 50 mg evaporation amount of PEAI achieved a PCE of 5.28%. With the addition of a lithium fluoride (LiF) buffer layer at the ITO/PEDOT:PSS interface, the PCE further increased to 6.98%.

On the other hand, Yokoyama et al.102 proposed a low temperature vapour assisted solution process (LT-VASP) to prepare MASnI3 films. MAI powder was first placed on a high temperature Petri dish (i.e. 150 °C) to generate MAI vapour. Subsequently, the prepared SnI2 film was transferred to the Petri dish for the kinetic gas (MAI vapour)–solid (SnI2 film) reaction to form the MASnI3 film. A PCE of 1.86% was achieved for the optimized device at a sample substrate temperature of 60 °C (i.e. a glass spacer is added at the bottom of the sample substrate to reduce its temperature, Fig. 7). In the following year, the same group used the same method to prepare the MASnBr3 film but achieved a lower PCE of <1%.103 Later, Wang et al.104 proposed SnF2 as the Sn2+ source to replace SnI2. Initially, SnF2:PEDOT:PSS was coated on the PEDOT:PSS substrate. Then, the prepared film was transferred to a N2-filled glove box and loaded face down on a Petri dish on a hotplate to react with MAI vapour. The ion exchange/insertion reaction between SnF2 and MAI could be explained as follows: (i) solid state SnF2 was reacted with the MAI vapour, thus generating the intermediate SnI2 and a byproduct of CH3NH3F (i.e. SnF2 + 2CH3NH3I → SnI2 + 2CH3NH3F); (ii) CH3NH3F was assumed to be lost via evaporation in the second step (i.e. CH3NH3F → CH3NH2↑ + HF↑); (iii) lastly, MAI vapour was inserted to the solid state SnF2 film to form the MASnI3 film (i.e. SnF2 + CH3NH3I → CH3NH3SnI3). Because the MASnI3 film prepared using a reaction time of 60 minutes was uniform, pinhole free and exhibited a low concentration of Sn4+, and the device achieved the best PCE of 7.78%.

4.4 Other methods
Li et al.105 developed an organic cation-exchange approach for the fabrication of a high quality MASnI3 film. Briefly, hydrazinium tin iodide (HASnI3) was solution-deposited on the substrate surface, followed by a low temperature heat-treatment of the resultant film. Then, the sample was transferred to a N2-filled glove box for the organic cation-exchange approach. The MA gas was produced through the reaction between methylammonium chloride (MACl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and passed through a calcium oxide (CaO) dryer (Fig. 8). The whole reaction process can be written as NH2NH3SnI3 + CH3NH2 → CH3NH3SnI3 + NH2NH2. The MA vapour was diffused inside the HASnI3 film and interacted with NH2NH3+ to form a complex, followed by chemical conversion of CH3NH2 + NH2NH3+ → CH3NH3+ + N2H4via a transition state of NH2NH2··H··CH3NH2. Finally, MASnI3 was formed after the N2H4 gas was released from its surface. Due to the high quality of the derived MASnI3 film, a PCE of 7.13% with good reproducibility was achieved. Tavakoli et al.106 proposed the chemical vapour-deposition method to fabricate MAPb1−xSnxI3 films. In this work, the films were formed as a result of the reaction between the evaporated mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ halide and MAI inside a furnace at 185 °C for 40 minutes under an argon atmosphere. After optimization, a PCE of 14.04% was achieved for the MAPb0.38Sn0.62I3 device. Meanwhile, doctor-blade coating has also been used to fabricate high quality mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ films (i.e. uniform with a smaller number of pinholes) for highly efficient PSCs.107,108

5. What issues do Sn2+ based halide perovskite solar cells face?
Although the efficiency of Sn2+ and mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ halide PSCs has seen rapid improvement (Fig. 9a and b), they are still far behind the theoretical efficiency limit (i.e. PCE of >30% for Eg in the range of 1.1 eV to 1.3 eV), governed by the S–Q limit (Fig. 9c). Such a low PCE could be attributed to several reasons: (i) fast oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ (i.e. self-doped or p-type doping), which results in a high background carrier density that can act as trap states and leads to significant carrier recombination in the perovskite film;27,109 (ii) uncontrollable crystallization due to the high Lewis acidity of Sn2+ hinders the uniform growth of Sn2+ based halide perovskite films (i.e. it forms flower-like grains with lots of pinholes on the perovskite film surface), consequently leading to a direct contact between the ETL and HTL;90,110,111 (iii) conventional HTLs such as spiro-OMeTAD and poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) require hygroscopic dopants and additives to improve their hole transporting properties, which can accelerate the degradation of Sn2+ based halide perovskite films;112 (iv) a large energy-level offset between the CBM/VBM of Sn2+ based halide perovskites and the ETL/HTL leads to unfavourable charge recombination at the perovskite/CTL interface before the free electrons/free holes can be injected to the ETL/HTL (Fig. 9d). Thus, it has limited the maximum attainable photovoltage and fill factor of the device.113–116 As such, it is crucial to develop effective strategies that can address these issues for the development of highly efficient and stable Sn2+ and mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ halide PSCs.

6. Device engineering of single-junction ASnX3 perovskite solar cells
PCEs of more than 10% have been achieved for single-junction ASnX3 PSCs. The significant enhancement of the device performance is due to not only the material itself (i.e. low Eg, long absorption range up to NIR and high carrier mobility), but also the evolution of the device engineering as well. In the following subsections, we will summarize six major strategies, namely additive engineering, composition engineering, interface engineering, solvent engineering, treatment engineering and perovskite dimensionality manipulation for the fabrication of highly efficient and stable devices. The performance and stability evolutions of each strategy of single-junction ASnX3 PSCs after optimization are listed in Table 1.

6.1 Additive engineering
The Sn2+ in the ASnX3 crystal lattice gets easily oxidized when exposed to moisture, resulting in a high background carrier density that can act as trap states in the perovskite film. To address these issues, an additive has been used to retard the oxidation of Sn2+ and improve the optoelectronic properties of ASnX3 films. The roles of different additives (i.e. Sn(II) halides, organic and inorganic additives) from different aspects in ASnX3 PSCs will be discussed in detail.

6.1.1 Sn(II) halide materials (SnF2, SnI2, SnBr2 and SnCl2). 
For the first time, Kumar et al.118 demonstrated that the addition of 20 mol% of the SnF2 additive in the CsSnI3 film reduced the background carrier density from 1019 cm−3 to 1017 cm−3, which was associated with the Sn2+ intrinsic defects in the CsSnI3 film. As such, the device performance was increased from 0.0003% to 2.02%. No variation loss in the PCE was observed after being stored in a glove box for more than 250 hours, indicating that SnF2 improved the device stability. One year later, Koh et al.119 showed that the SnF2 additive stabilized the FASnI3 precursor solution by delaying the oxidation of Sn2+. The SnF2:FASnI3 mixed-solution remained in yellow colour after being stored overnight or even longer, whereas the precursor without SnF2 turned to orange colour after being stored overnight. With the addition of 20 mol% SnF2 in the FASnI3 film, more homogeneous surface coverage of the FASnI3 film was achieved, which was beneficial for suppressing the carrier recombination between the HTLs and ETLs. In this work, a PCE of 2.10% was achieved for the optimized device. Gupta et al.120 reported that the SnF2 additive improved the energy level alignment between the Sn2+ perovskite and CTLs by minimizing the energy offset between the Sn2+ perovskite and CTLs. Consequently, the device achieved a PCE of 2.17%. On the other hand, Liao et al.121 presented that the SnF2 additive improved the FASnI3 film morphology by reducing the flower-like structure and number of pinholes in the perovskite film (Fig. 10). However, at a higher concentration of SnF2, bright rod-like structure phase separation was induced, which could deteriorate the device performance. A PCE of 6.22% was achieved for the device obtained using 10 mol% SnF2. After encapsulation, the device maintained 85% of its initial PCE after being stored in a dark glove box for 30 days. Meanwhile, it has also been reported that the SnF2 additive prolonged the carrier lifetime122 and promoted the perovskite crystal nucleation growth123 in ASnX3 PSCs.

Apart from SnF2, other Sn2+ halide materials (i.e. SnI2, SnBr2 and SnCl2) have also been utilized as additives to prepare ASnX3 perovskite films. For example, Marshall et al.124 reported that excess SnI2 occupied some of the spaces between adjacent CsSnI3 crystallites, which could inhibit the ingression of oxygen and water to CsSnI3 films. As such, it reduced the oxidation rate in the CsSnI3 films. At the optimum concentration of 10 mol% SnI2, the device achieved the best PCE (average PCE) of 2.76% (2.13 ± 0.53)%. Song et al.125 reported that excess SnI2 has good dispersibility in ASnI3 films (i.e. A = MA+, FA+ and Cs+) without any deteriorating the morphology of the perovskite films. Combined with a reducing atmosphere and an optimized ratio of CsI/SnI2 at 0.4 (i.e. equivalent to 120 mol% excess SnI2), the device achieved a PCE of 4.81%. Using the same device fabrication method, the MASnI3 (FASnI3) device achieved the best PCE of 2.01% (2.33%) at the optimum ratio of MAI/SnI2 (FAI/SnI2) of 0.4–0.6 (0.6–0.8). On the other hand, Heo et al.126 claimed that SnBr2 was an outstanding additive in the CsSnI3 film. They found that SnBr2 not only maintained the initial βγ-CsSnI3 phase, but also formed a homogeneous film without the formation of aggregated particles on top of the SnBr2-treated CsSnI3 film. In contrast, the perovskite films prepared using SnCl2 and SnF2 changed to Y-CsSnI3 phase after being stored in a N2-filled glove box for 100 hours, and induced phase segregation as well. As a result, the device obtained using the SnBr2 additive exhibited a higher PCE of 4.30% and excellent stability. Apart from SnI2,124 Marshall et al.127 also investigated SnF2, SnBr2 and SnCl2 for HTL free CsSnI3 PSCs. A poor PCE of <0.4% was achieved for the device obtained using SnF2 and SnBr2 additives. In contrast, the device obtained using excess SnCl2 additive achieved the best PCE (average PCE) of 3.56% (3.35 ± 0.21)%, which could be attributed to the fact that the excess SnCl2 at the surface of the CsSnI3 crystallites moderately n-doped the ETL, forming a Schottky barrier to the unwanted extraction of electrons from the ETL into the TCO electrode at the site of pinholes in the perovskite film, thereby allowing the device to function well without the need of a HTL.


6.1.2 Organic additives. 
Pyrazine128 mitigated the phase separation induced by excess SnF2 and suppressed the oxidation of Sn2+ in the FASnI3 film. Thus, the optimized device achieved a PCE of 4.8%. After encapsulation, it maintained 98% of the initial PCE after being exposed to ambient air with an ≈25% relative humidity at 25 °C for 100 days. By adding the trimethylamine (TMA)85 additive in the SnX2 (X = I−, F−) precursor solution during the first step of the two-step sequential deposition method, SnX2–TMA complexes (X = I−, F−) were formed. These SnX2–TMA complexes (i) slowed down the crystallization between SnX2 and FAI, (ii) formed a homogeneous FASnI3 film with larger crystalline domains (i.e. >1 μm) and (iii) suppressed the oxidation of Sn2+ in the FASnI3 film. PCEs of 4.34% and 7.09% were achieved for the optimized devices with n–i–p and p–i–n structures, respectively. Without encapsulation, both TMA-treated devices retained ≈80% of the initial PCE after being stored in a N2-filled glove box at room temperature for 20 days.
On the other hand, Jokar et al.129 reported that the butylammonium iodide (BAI) additive could alter the orientation of perovskite crystal growth and improved the connectivity of the crystal grains by merging them together to form a continuous Sn2+ perovskite film without apparent crystalline grain boundaries. However, the problem of pinholes presenting on the surface remains unsolved. Due to the hydrophobic organic molecule of BAI, it prevented air-moisture from interacting with the perovskite surface and suppressed the oxidation of Sn2+ in the FASnI3 film. As a result, a longer exciton lifetime of 0.24 ns was obtained for the 15% BAI-treated FASnI3 film, as compared to the control film, with a shorter exciton lifetime of 0.1 ns. A PCE of 5.5% was achieved for the optimized device, which exhibited long-term operational stability. It maintained >90% of the initial PCE over 2000 hours after encapsulation, which could mainly be attributed to the fact that BAI acted as a protecting layer in the FASnI3 film. In contrast, the ethylenediammonium diiodide (EDAI2)129 additive formed a dense-packed and pinhole free perovskite film with smaller grain sizes, indicating that EDAI2 could balance the kinetic process between nucleation and perovskite crystal growth. The best PCE of 7.14% was achieved for the 1% EDAI2-treated device. After encapsulation and being stored for 1462 hours, the device performance further increased to 8.9%, which could be attributed to the EDA2+ relaxed structural stress of the perovskite crystal, and the crystal structure optimized gradually to its optimal phase with an increase of the storage duration.
Yu et al.130 reported that 5 mol% of the 2,2,2-trifluoroethylamine hydrochloride (TFEACl) additive in the FASnI3 film improved the device performance from 3.63% to 5.30%, which could be attributed to the fact that TFEACl (i) formed a more favourable energy level alignment between the perovskite and CTLs, (ii) formed full surface coverage of the perovskite film with less phase separation of SnF2 and (iii) inhibited the oxidation of Sn2+ in the FASnI3 film. Thus, the trap state density in the FASnI3 film reduced from 9.4 × 1015 cm−3 to 6.0 × 1015 cm−3. Meanwhile, it also improved the device light stability, thanks to the hydrophobicity of TFEACl. After continuous one sun illumination (i.e. AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) at 50 °C for 350 hours, the TFEACl-treated device retained >60% of its initial PCE, whereas the control device completely failed after 120 hours.
Tai et al.131 proposed the use of phenolsulfonic acid (PSA), 2-aminophenol-4-sulfonic acid (APSA), and the potassium salt of hydroquinone sulfonic acid (KHQSA) as additives (Fig. 11a) to process the FASnI3 film. The authors found that the interaction between Sn2+ in FASnI3 and the SO3− group in these additives (Fig. 11b) could (i) reduce the phase separation in the perovskite film (Fig. 11d–g), (ii) decrease the perovskite grain size and (iii) form in situ encapsulation in the inner perovskite (Fig. 11c, bottom). Benefitting from these, the PCE was increased from 3.53% for the control device to 5.58%, 5.16% and 6.76% for the devices obtained using 3% PSA, 3% APSA and 1.5% KHQSA, respectively. Among these devices, the 1.5% KHQSA-treated device showed superior long term operational stability, regardless of the environmental stability or light stability. Without encapsulation and being exposed to dark ambient air with an ≈20% relative humidity, it maintained >80% of its initial PCE for over 500 hours; at a higher air humidity of 45–48%, it preserved 80% of its initial PCE for over 160 hours. Under one sun illumination in ambient air with an ≈20% relative humidity, it took a 10 times longer time to lose the same percentage of its initial PCE. More importantly, the KHQSA additive could prevent the Ag electrode from corrosion, which is ascribed to the reaction of I− containing volatile species with Ag, driven by the decomposition of the perovskite material itself.

Kayesh et al.132 reported that the 5-ammonium valeric acid iodide (5-AVAI) additive in the FASnI3 film (i) passivated the perovskite grain boundaries, (ii) assisted perovskite grain growth with full surface coverage (i.e. homogeneous and pinhole free film) and (iii) suppressed the oxidation of Sn2+. Thus, a longer PL carrier lifetime of 5.88 ns was obtained for the 5-AVAI-treated FASnI3 film, as compared to the control film, which could be attributed to the fact that 5-AVAI inhibited carrier recombination in the FASnI3 film. No formation of a low dimensional (LD), i.e., 2D, perovskite was observed due to the low doping concentration of 5-AVAI in the FASnI3 film. A PCE of 7.0% was achieved for the optimized device, which exhibited longer operational stability. Without encapsulation, the 5-AVAI-treated device (control device) maintained 40% of its initial PCE (completely failed) after being exposed to ambient air with an ≈50% relative humidity for 50 hours (10 hours). After encapsulation, the 5-AVAI-treated device (control device) showed almost no PCE loss (≈20% PCE loss) under continuous one sun illumination at the maximum power point for 100 hours.
Liu et al.133 reported that the poly[tetraphenylethene 3,3′-(((2,2-diphenylethene-1,1-diyl)bis(4,1-phenylene))bis(oxy))bis(N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine)tetraphenylethene] (PTN-Br) additive in the FASnI3 film enhanced the hole transporting properties in the device. PTN-Br not only fulfilled the need of perovskite grain boundaries to serve as the hole transporting medium, but also reduced the trap state density in the FASnI3 film. As such, it established suitable gradient band alignment at the PEDOT:PSS/FASnI3 interface and maximized the hole extraction efficiency to the anode (Fig. 12a and b). A PCE of 7.94% was attained for the device obtained using 0.02% mol PTN-Br, which exhibited higher UV light stability. Without encapsulation, it maintained ≈66% of the initial PCE after 5 hours of UV light illumination in a N2-filled glove box at room temperature, which was measured every 30 minutes, whereas the control device maintained only 29% of its initial PCE under the same exposure conditions.

Meng et al.134 demonstrated that the poly(vinyl)alcohol (PVA) additive in the FASnI3 film not only retarded perovskite crystal growth, but also formed uniform nucleation sites. As such, a compact, smaller grain size and lower trap density perovskite film was obtained for 3 mg mL−1 PVA-treated FASnI3. A PCE of 8.92% was achieved for the optimized device, which exhibited excellent light stability. No PCE loss was observed for the encapsulated 3 mg mL−1 PVA-treated device after 400 hours of continuous one sun illumination (with a 420 nm cut-off UV filter) at 25 °C in ambient air at the maximum power point tracking, which could be attributed to the fact that the O–H⋯I− hydrogen bonding interaction between the PVA and FASnI3 at the perovskite grain boundaries could suppress unfavourable I− ion diffusion, resulting in improved operational stability. Meanwhile, the same group135 also added the 2-cyano-3-[5-[4-(diphenylamino)phenyl]-2-thienyl]-propenoic acid (CDTA) additive in the FASnI3 film to retard the perovskite crystallization rate. With the addition of the CDTA additive, the FASnI3 film remained in yellow colour during the antisolvent dripping process, indicating that CDTA formed a highly oriented stable intermediate phase with a Sn–I framework. In addition, CDTA also formed a compact FASnI3 film with a larger grain size, which was beneficial for charge extraction from the perovskite to CTLs and charge separation at the perovskite/CTL interface. Furthermore, the strong hydrophobicity of the aromatic ring on the π-conjugated CDTA molecule at the surface of the FASnI3 film rather than the bulk film also hindered the permeation of air moisture into the perovskite lattice and suppressed the oxidation of the FASnI3 film. Benefitting from these, the optimized device obtained using 2 mol% CDTA achieved the best PCE (certified PCE) of 10.17% (9.39%) with excellent light stability. The encapsulated CDTA-treated device maintained 90% of its initial PCE under continuous one sun illumination in ambient air with a 30% relative humidity at the maximum power point for 1000 hours. Despite PVA134 and CDTA,135 the same group136 also investigated the tailor-made pentafluorophen-oxyethylammonium iodide (FOEI) additive in the FASnI3 film. They observed that FOEI not only assisted the nucleation, but also passivated the perovskite crystal surface. Thus, the FOEI-treated FASnI3 film exhibited smooth morphology with excellent optoelectronic properties, resulting in a high PCE of 10.81% (certified PCE of 10.16%). No PCE loss was observed for the encapsulated FOEI-treated device after 500 hours of continuous one sun illumination, which could be attributed to the fact that the FOEI-treated film exhibited a lower number of defect states and thus reduced the ion migration pathway. Meanwhile, the authors also applied pentafluorophen-oxypropylammonium (FOPI) and pentafluorophen-ethylammonium (FEI) additives in FASnI3 solar cells. However, the devices obtained using both FOPI and FPI exhibited lower PCEs, i.e., 9.27% and 5.93%, respectively, compared to the FOEI-based device. The authors explained that these lower PCEs of FOPI and FEI based devices were attributed to the relatively longer trimethylene group and steric effects of 2,5 F atoms at the benzene ring, respectively.
Fu et al.137 utilized the aminoguanidine hydrochloride (NH2GACl) additive to process the PEA0.1FA0.9SnI3 film. They found that 0.05 M NH2GACl (i) formed a film with a larger perovskite grain size and a smoother surface with lower roughness and (ii) improved energy band alignment at the PEDOT:PSS/PEA0.1FA0.9SnI3 interface. The VBM of the PEA0.1FA0.1SnI3 film has shifted downward by 0.12 eV with the addition of NH2GACl (i.e. −5.06 eV), which was close to the HOMO level of PEDOT:PSS (i.e. −5.00 eV), and (iii) suppressed the formation of Sn2+ vacancies by forming six hydrogen bonds with the neighbouring partial iodine ions of exposed SnI64− in the perovskite crystals (Fig. 13). Benefitting from these, the NH2GACl-treated PEA0.1FA0.1SnI3 film exhibited a longer carrier lifetime of 12.06 ns (i.e. 8.15 ns for the control film), a higher hole mobility of 3.42 × 10−3 cm−2 V−1 s−1 (i.e. 2.52 × 10−3 cm−2 V−1 s−1 for the control film) and a lower trap density of 6.11 × 1016 cm−3 (i.e. 7.12 × 1016 cm−3 for the control film). A PCE of 7.30% was obtained for the optimized device. Meanwhile, NH2GACl also improved the device environmental stability. Without encapsulation, the NH2GACl-treated device retained 90% (72%) of its initial PCE after being stored in a N2-filled glove box (ambient air with an ≈60% relative humidity at ≈25 °C) for 30 days (100 minutes), which could be attributed to the fact that an increase in the hydrophobicity of PEA0.1FA0.1SnI3 with the addition of NH2GACl inhibited oxygen penetration to the PEA0.1FA0.9SnI3 perovskite film.

On the other hand, Wang et al.138 reported that gallic acid (GA) suppressed SnCl2 aggregation that enveloped within the FASnI3 perovskite grain surface. As shown in Fig. 14a, the antioxidant properties of the GA additive originated from the reducing hydroxyl group (–OH) that was attached to the aromatic ring. When the GA-treated Sn2+ halide perovskite film was exposed to air, the –OH group in GA could effectively scavenge oxygen by donating a hydrogen atom and electrons, and finally GA was transferred to quinone derivatives. Hence, GA could repair the surface defect of the Sn2+ perovskite film and protect the film from oxidation to Sn4+. The authors found that 1 mol% GA in the FASnI3 film could significantly increase the carrier PL lifetime from 0.68 ns to 1.3 ns and reduce the trap density in the perovskite film from 3.63 × 1015 cm−3 to 2.68 × 1015 cm−3. Thus, an optimum PCE of 9.03% was achieved for the 1 mol% GA-treated device. Encouragingly, the GA additive also healed and improved the device stability in a N2 atmosphere. Without encapsulation, the GA-treated device showed a slowly increasing PCE within 1500 hours, whereas the control device exhibited PCE loss with an increase of the storage duration. In addition, the GA-treated device also demonstrated better ambient air and light stabilities. Without encapsulation, it maintained 80% (77%) of the initial PCE after being exposed to ambient air with an ≈20% (≈60%) relative humidity for 1000 hours (120 hours). Under constant light-soaking in ambient air with a ≈20% relative humidity, it maintained 70% of the initial PCE after 140 minutes.

Ma et al.139 obtained a pinhole free, small grain size, and high surface coverage Sn2+ perovskite film by adding the hexamethylenediamine diiodide (HDADI) additive in the FASnI3 film. No formation of a 2D D–J layered perovskite was observed when the HDADI doping concentration was less than 5%. Because of the hexamethylenediamine cation (HDA2+) terminated amino groups, the amino groups therefore could provide bi-sites to passivate the charge defects or dangling bonds of Sn2+ perovskites and simultaneously reduce the number of Sn2+ vacancies by suppressing the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ (Fig. 14b). Thus, the film obtained using 1% HDADI exhibited a low non-radiative recombination rate with a longer exciton lifetime of 2.67 ns, as compared to the control film with a shorter exciton lifetime of 1.58 ns. The optimized device achieved a PCE of 7.60% and maintained 80% of its initial PCE after being stored in a glove box for 550 hours.
Lin et al.140 reported that the 8-hydroxyquinoline (8-HQ) additive could significantly suppress the oxidation of Sn2+. With 8-HQ, the FASnI3 precursor solution took a longer time to change its initial yellow colour to dark red colour and exhibited a much lower Sn4+ concentration (i.e. 13.92%) and a lower trap state density (i.e. 8.25 × 1015 cm−3). In contrast, the control film exhibited a higher Sn4+ concentration of 43.16% and a higher trap state density of 9.82 × 1015 cm−3. Meanwhile, 8-HQ also formed a denser perovskite film without cracks and minimized the energy barrier at the PEDOT:PSS/FASnI3 interface. Benefitting from these, the carrier lifetime and hole carrier mobility of the 8-HQ-treated FASnI3 film were improved from 1.22 ns to 5.12 ns and from 1.01 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 3.65 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. A PCE of 7.15% was obtained for the optimized device. Meanwhile, 8-HQ also improved the device environmental stability. With 8-HQ, the device maintained ≈90% (40%) of its initial PCE after being stored in a N2 atmosphere (ambient air with a 50% relative humidity) for 800 hours (32 hours), whereas the control device degraded to 0% after 24 hours in ambient air.
Chen et al.141 suggested the use of the 4-(aminomethyl)-piperidinium (4AMP) additive to process the FASnI3 film. No formation of the LD D–J perovskite was observed at a low concentration of AMP (i.e. 15%), as the bright nano-platelets associated with LD D–J phases were significantly reduced compared to the FASnI3 film obtained using a higher concentration of 4AMP (i.e. 25% AMP). The authors suggested that FASnI3 grains were most likely encapsulated in situ by 4AMP molecules which functionalized both grain surface and grain boundaries, rather than on top of the FASnI3 film. As a result, 4AMP not only retarded the air-moisture from ingression into the FASnI3 bulk film for improved stability, but also suppressed the generation of Sn2+ vacancies for reduced non-radiative recombination. A PCE of 10.86% was achieved for the optimized device obtained using 15% 4AMP. Without encapsulation, the device maintained 77% of its initial PCE after being tested under continuous one sun illumination (i.e. white LED light) in a N2 atmosphere at 40 °C for 500 hours.
Mohammadian-Sarcheshmeh et al.142 utilized urea acid (UA) as an additive to (i) reduce the perovskite crystallization growth rate and (ii) hinder the oxidation of Sn2+ in the FASnI3 film. As a result, a PCE of 1.2% was achieved for the optimized device, whereas the control device achieved a lower PCE of 0.80%.
Li et al.143 utilized the 2-fluoro-phenethylammonium iodide (2-F-PEAI) additive to alter the morphology and optoelectronic properties of the FASnI3 film. With the addition of 8% 2-F-PEAI in the FASnI3 film, (i) a uniform and denser film with larger perovskite grain sizes was formed, (ii) the defect concentration in the FASnI3 film was reduced, whereby the Urbach energy associated with defect states reduced from 173.61 meV to 66.89 meV, and (iii) a suitable energy level alignment between FASnI3 and CTLs was formed. As such, a shorter carrier extraction lifetime of 0.12 ms and a longer recombination lifetime of 1.24 ms were obtained for the 2-F-PEAI-treated FASnI3 film, indicating fast carrier extraction from FASnI3 to CTLs with a low recombination rate at the FASnI3/CTL interface. The optimized device achieved the best PCE of 10.17% (certified PCE of 8.57%). Without encapsulation, the 2-F-PEAI-treated device also exhibited better stability compared to the control device, which could be attributed to the fact that the hydrophobic nature of 2-F-PEAI repelled air moisture and suppressed the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ in the FASnI3 film.
On the other hand, Liu et al.144 reported that the phenylhydrazine hydrochloride (PHCl) additive enhanced the driving force of photogenerated carrier separation and minimized the carrier recombination loss in the device. As such, the carrier lifetime and built-in voltage of the PHCl-treated FASnI3 film were ≈3 times longer and ≈3.5 times higher than those of the control film. The best PCE (certified PCE) of 11.4% (10.8%) was achieved for the 5% PHCl-treated device, which exhibited higher environmental and light stabilities compared to the control device (Fig. 15c and d). Similar to the GA additive, PHCL also healed the device efficiency after being exposed to ambient air (Fig. 15a and b), which could be attributed to the hydrazino and hydrophobic phenyl groups of PHCl passivated and repaired the Sn2+ vacancies (i.e. oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+) in the FASnI3 film.

6.1.3 Inorganic additives. 
Recently, inorganic co-additives have also been utilized in ASnX3 PSCs. Li et al.145 reported that hypophosphorous acid (HPA) in the CsSnIBr2 film promoted perovskite crystal growth and expelled redundant SnF2 from the surface of the film through the coordination bond connection of Sn–O–P–O–Sn. As a result, it minimized charge transfer resistance and reduced carrier recombination at the perovskite/carbon electrode interface. At an optimized HPA concentration of 0.5 μL mL−1, the device achieved a PCE of 3.2%. Furthermore, the HPA-treated device also exhibited a higher stable power output. It maintained 98% of the initial PCE after continuous one sun illumination at a high temperature of 473 K for 9 hours. After encapsulation, it showed no PCE loss when exposed to ambient air with an ≈20% relative humidity at ≈25 °C for 77 days.
Kayesh et al.146 reported that the dissociation process of a hydrazine compound in hydrazinium chloride (N2H5Cl) released free electrons which could suppress the oxidation process of Sn2+ to Sn4+ through the reactions of 2N2H4 → 2NH3 + N2 + H2 + e− and Sn2+ → Sn4+ + 2e−. As a result, the Sn4+ concentration in the N2H5Cl-treated FASnI3 film was 20% lower compared to that of the control film. In addition to that, N2H5Cl also induced the formation of a film with larger perovskite grains, full surface coverage and a lower number of pinholes. Benefitting from these, a longer PL carrier lifetime of 4.83 ns was achieved for the N2H5Cl-treated film, whereas the control film exhibited a shorter PL carrier lifetime of 3.53 ns. The best PCE of 5.40% was achieved for the 2.5 mol% N2H5Cl-treated device, which exhibited excellent environmental stability. The N2H5Cl-treated device maintained 65% of its initial PCE after being stored for 1000 hours. By replacing N2H5Cl with hydrazinium bromide (N2H5Br),147 a higher PCE of 7.81% was achieved for the 0.02 M N2H5Br-treated device, which could be attributed to the fact that N2H5Br lowered the Sn4+ concentration and formed a larger Eg in the FASnI3 film.
Other than the sulfonate group (SO3−) based additive,131 the Yan group also utilized ammonium hypophosphite (AHP) as an additive to process the FASnI3 film.148 Because the AHP additive could coordinate with the Sn2+ halide perovskite and eliminate phase separation in the FASnI3 film, a more compact and pinhole free perovskite film was obtained. In addition, AHP also suppressed the oxidation of Sn2+ through the reaction of Sn4+ + 3H2PO2− → Sn2+ + 2HPO32− + PH4+, resulting in a low trap density in the perovskite film. Thus, the PL carrier lifetime and trap state density of the AHP-treated FASnI3 film were increased from 0.85 ns to 2.23 ns and reduced from 3.45 × 1015 cm−3 to 1.88 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. At an optimum AHP concentration of 5 mol%, the device achieved a PCE of 7.34% and exhibited excellent environmental stability. It maintained 50% (70%) of the initial PCE after being stored exposed to ambient air with a 20% relative humidity (N2 environment) for 500 hours (1000 hours).
Li et al.149 synthesized trihydrazine dihydriodide (THDH, (N2H4)3(HI)2) by combining hydrazine and hydriodic acid in ethanol under weak alkaline conditions for solution deposition of the FASnI3 layer. THDH not only formed a homogeneous and full surface coverage FASnI3 film, but also lowered the Sn4+ concentration and reduced the Urbach energy in FASnI3 film. For example, the Sn4+ concentration associated with Sn2+ vacancies was reduced from 35.9% to 9.1%, whereas the Urbach energy associated with defect density was reduced from 125 meV to 88 meV through the reaction of N2H4 + Sn4+ → N2 + Sn2+. Thus, a longer PL carrier lifetime of 3.51 ns was obtained, whereas the control film exhibited a shorter PL carrier lifetime of 0.18 ns. In this work, the device obtained using 3 mol% THDH achieved an optimum PCE of 8.48%, which could be attributed to the fact that THDH suppressed the carrier recombination loss in the device.
Meng et al.150 proposed liquid formic acid (LFA) as an additive to process the FASnI3 film. With the addition of 50% LFA in the FASnI3 film, the device performance was increased from 6.31% to 10.37%, which could be attributed to the excellent optoelectronic properties of the LFA-treated FASnI3 film such as higher crystallinity, a lower background doping density of 1.07 × 1017 cm−3 (i.e. 2.29 × 1017 cm−3 for the control film) and a lower electronic trap density of 2.1 × 1017 cm−3 (i.e. 2.6 × 1017 cm−3 for the control film). As a result, it improved the free carrier extraction/injection to the respective electrodes with a low recombination rate. After encapsulation, the LFA-treated device also exhibited excellent light stability. It retained >95% of its initial PCE after one sun illumination in ambient air at 25 °C for 200 hours, which could be attributed to the fact that the modified Sn2+ perovskite film reduced the pathway for ion migration.

6.2 Composition engineering
Additive engineering enhances device performance and stability simultaneously. Meanwhile, researchers also propose composition engineering due to the easily adjustable composition of these materials. It can be simply carried out by adding the suitable cation in the A-site, anion in the X-site or mixed cation–anion in the A–X site of the ASnX3 perovskite lattice. In this subsection, composition engineering of the perovskite structure and morphology, the optoelectronic properties of the perovskite film and its effects on device performance/stability will be discussed in detail.

6.2.1 Partial substitution in the A-site with organic cations. 
The most commonly used Sn2+ halide perovskite layers are MASnI3, FASnI3 and CsSnI3. To improve the optoelectronic properties and morphology of Sn2+ halide perovskite films, researchers introduced organic cations in ASnX3 films. For example, Zhao et al.81 introduced FA+ in MASnI3 to form composite FAxMA1−xSnI3 films. With FA+, it (i) reduced the pinhole formation in the MASnI3 film, (ii) increased the perovskite grain size with clear boundaries and (iii) eliminated/reduced the phase separation induced by SnF2 (Fig. 16a and b). Due to defect passivation in the MASnI3 film with the addition of FA+, the PL carrier lifetime was increased from (1.62 ± 0.01) ns (i.e. FA+ = 0%) to (4.92 ± 0.02) ns (i.e. FA+ = 100%), indicating that FA+ suppressed the carrier recombination loss in the MASnI3 film. In addition, FA+ reduced the energy barrier at the MASnI3/CTL interface, especially at an optimum composition of x = 0.75 (Fig. 16c). Thus, a PCE of 8.12% was obtained for the FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 device. Also, the FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 device maintained 80% of the initial PCE after being stored in a N2-filled glove box for 400 hours.

Meanwhile, ethylenediammonium {en}151,152 has also been introduced as a new organic cation in ASnI3 films (i.e. {en}ASnI3, where A = MA+, FA+ and Cs+). Even though {en} formed a ‘hollow’ 3D [SnI3]− network perovskite structure (Fig. 17a), it greatly enhanced the device performance and stability. After optimization, PCEs of 7.14%, 6.63% and 3.79% were achieved for the devices obtained using 10% {en}-treated FASnI3, 15% {en}-treated MASnI3 and 10% {en}-treated CsSnI3, respectively. Higher device performance compared to that of the control device could be attributed to the excellent surface coverage of the perovskite film with better optoelectronic properties, such as a longer carrier lifetime, a lower trap state density, and the suppression of the oxidation of Sn2+. Meanwhile, {en} also improved the air and thermal stabilities of the Sn2+ perovskite film (Fig. 17b). Without encapsulation, the 10% {en}-treated FASnI3 device maintained 50% of its initial PCE after constant one sun illumination in ambient air at room temperature for 60 minutes, whereas the control device degraded to zero after 20 minutes. Under the same measurement conditions, 15% {en}-treated MASnI3 and 10% {en}-treated CsSnI3 devices maintained only ≈60% of their initial PCEs after 10 minutes and 3 minutes, respectively.

Later, the same group replaced {en} with 10% propylenediammonium (PN) and 10% trimethylenediammonium (TN) in the FASnI3 film.153 Similar to {en},151,152 PN and TN formed a 3D hollow perovskite, improved perovskite film surface coverage with a lower number of pinholes and suppressed the trap state density in the FASnI3 film. As such, the PN- and TN-treated devices exhibited a small dark leakage current and less carrier recombination loss in the device, thereby achieving optimum PCEs of 5.85% and 5.53%, respectively, which were twice those of the control device (i.e. 2.53%).
Inspired by previous work,129 the Diau group154 presented the guanidinium (GA+) inorganic additive in the FASnI3-1% of EDAI2 film. No formation of 2D perovskite was observed as the GA+ treated-FASnI3-1% EDAI2 films adapted the same structure and phase stability as their parent FASnI3 perovskite (i.e. up to 30% GA+). The authors found that GA+ could (i) suppress the oxidation of Sn2+, (ii) increase the Sn2+/Sn4+ ratio from 9.10 for 0% GA+ to 16.86 for 20% GA+ and (iii) shift the VBM of the perovskite downward to match with the HOMO level of PEDOT:PSS. In contrast, EDAI2 slowed down and altered the orientation of the perovskite crystal growth. In this work, the 20% GA-treated device (i.e. GA0.2FA0.78SnI3–1% EDAI2) achieved the best PCE of 8.50% (certified PCE of 8.30%). Surprisingly, the PCE of the 20% GA-treated device could further increase to 9.60% from its initial PCE value of 7.3% after being stored in a N2-filled glove box for 2000 hours. Without encapsulation, the optimized device (control device) maintained ≈80% (≈60%) of its initial PCE after being exposed to ambient air with an ≈60% relative humidity for 96 hours. At a low air humidity of ≈20%, the optimized device (control device) showed no PCE loss (slight degradation in PCE) after 170 hours. The superior environmental stability of the 20% GA+–1% EDAI2-treated device was attributed to the fact that GA+ with zero electric-dipolar moment inside the FASnI3 framework could hinder the oxidation of the perovskite under air-moisture conditions. Besides, the same group also introduced 2-hydroxyethylammonium (HEA+) in the FASnI3 film (i.e. HEAxFA1−xSnI3) for carbon based mesoscopic solar cell application.155 In this work, HEA+ played a key role in controlling the perovskite crystal structure. The structure was altered from orthorhombic for x = 0 to rhombohedral for x = 0.2 to 0.4. At 0.6 < x < 1.0, the 3D-vacant perovskite with a tetragonal structure was obtained due to the formation of Sn2+ and I− vacancies in the perovskite films, with a new formula of HEAxFA1−xSn0.67I2.33. Among these compositions, 40% HEA+ exhibited a strong n-type characteristic and matched well with the CBM of TiO2, which was beneficial for electron transfer. Thus, the resultant device (i.e. combined with 3% EDAI2 additive) achieved a PCE of 3.7% and further increased to 3.9% after being stored inside a glove box for 340 hours.
Ran et al.63 partially replaced FA+ with 3-phenyl-2-propen-1-amine (PPA) in the FASnI3 film, forming PPAxFA1−xSnI3. With the addition of PPA, it (i) suppressed nucleation and promoted perovskite crystal growth into larger grains with high preferred orientation, (ii) prevented the oxidation of Sn2+ and lowered the trap density in the FASnI3 film and (iii) facilitated charge transport by constructing a better energy level alignment between the perovskite and CTLs. Thus, a PCE of 9.61% was achieved for the 15% PPA-treated device, which demonstrated excellent environmental and thermal stabilities. Without encapsulation, the 15% PPA-treated device could maintain 92%, 60%, or 60% of the initial PCE after being stored in a N2-filled glove box, exposed to ambient air with a 60% room humidity, or heated at 100 °C for 1440 hours, 10 hours, or 100 minutes, respectively. In contrast, the control device exhibited a fast degradation process. The high stability of the PPA-treated device attributed to the hydrophobic nature of PPA repelled air moisture from the surrounding and passivated defect state in the perovskite film. More interestingly, it was found that the steric hindrance effect of the large volume amine in PPA molecules could heal the device performance in an inert atmosphere (Fig. 18a). According to the authors, the FASnI3 structure can easily decompose when heated or exposed to ambient air. By adding PPA in the FASnI3 film, it could impose some restriction on the decomposed fragments such as FA+ and [SnI6]2− from falling or moving apart (Fig. 18b). Due to the low formation energy of PPA capped FASnI3 in a N2 atmosphere, FASnI3 films could reconstruct. Even after partial degradation, PPA still holds up all the disassembled building blocks into the same confined space. Thus, the FASnI3 structure is able to reassemble when the device is stored in an inert atmosphere.

6.2.2 Partial substitution in the A-site with inorganic cations. 
Gao et al.156 reported that Cs+ could shrink the FASnI3 perovskite crystal lattice with a tolerance factor close to 1 (i.e. CsxFA1−xSnI3, Fig. 19a), resulting in high structural stability. At a low Cs+ doping concentration (i.e. <20% Cs+), it enlarged the perovskite grain size. The grain size started to reduce with an increase of Cs+ concentration, which could be attributed to the dominant CsSnI3 phase with a small grain size. Compared to the control film, CsxFA1−xSnI3 films exhibited a lower Sn4+ concentration, indicating that Cs+ suppressed the formation of typical defects in the resultant film. The hole trap state density was reduced two-fold, from 6.31 × 1015 cm−3 for Cs+ = 0% to 3.31 × 1015 cm−3 for Cs+ = 8%. Meanwhile, Cs+ also increased the carrier mobility and reduced the bulk resistance in the FASnI3 film. As such, a PCE of 6.08% was obtained for the Cs0.08FA0.92FASnI3 device, which demonstrated better environmental and thermal stabilities. It maintained 90%, >60%, or 68% of the initial PCE after being stored in a N2-filled glove box, exposed to ambient air, or in a N2-filled glove box and heated at 100 °C for 2000 hours, 300 minutes, or 220 minutes, respectively.

Trasev et al.157 introduced hydrazinium (HA+) in the MASnI3 lattice, forming HAxMA1−xSnI3. At a low concentration of HA+ (i.e. <10% HA+), it failed to solve the pinhole problem in HAxMA1−xSnI3 films; at a higher HA+ concentration (i.e. >30% HA+), it formed larger randomly oriented grains in HAxMA1−xSnI3 films. The authors claimed that 20% HA+ was an optimum concentration due to the formation of a pinhole free film. The HA0.2MA0.8SnI3 device achieved a PCE of 2.6%, which demonstrated higher environmental stability. It retained 90% of the initial PCE after being stored in a N2-filled glove box for 5 days, which could be attributed to the fact that HA+ could prevent the disproportionation/oxidation of Sn(II) to Sn(IV) and Sn(0) species under light exposure.
Meanwhile, rubidium (Rb+) has also been proposed to partially insert in CsSnI3158 and FASnI3159 crystal lattices. Marshall et al.158 reported that Rb+ increased Eg and ionisation potential (Ip) energy in the CsSnI3 film. In this work, the optimized device obtained using 20% Rb+ (i.e. Rb0.2Cs0.8SnI3) achieved the best PCE (average PCE) of 2.58% (2.05 ± 0.26)%. Later, a higher PCE of 5.89% was achieved when RbCl was used as the Rb+ source in the FASnI3 PSC,159 which could be attributed to the improved RbCl morphology (Fig. 19b–e) and opto-physical properties of the RbxFA1−xSnI3 films. With the addition of 8% RbCl in the FASnI3 film, the carrier density was reduced from 8.64 × 1016 cm−3 to 9.57 × 1015 cm−3, whereas the defect density was reduced from 1.86 × 1017 cm−3 to 2.68 × 1016 cm−3, thereby minimizing carrier recombination in the device. Benefitting from these, the 8% Rb+-treated device exhibited higher environmental stability. After encapsulation, it maintained ≈60% of the initial PCE after being exposed to ambient air for 30 days, whereas the control device completely failed after 22 days.


6.2.3 Partial substitution in the X-site with halide anions. 
The chemical substitution of bromide (Br−) in the MASnI3 film raised the CBM of perovskite while maintaining its VBM.65 Thus, a large energy difference between the CBM of MASnI3−xBrx and the HOMO level of spiro-OMeTAD improved the Voc of the device. In contrast, the Jsc of the device was decreased. A PCE of (5.73 ± 0.23)% was achieved for the MASnIBr2 device. On the other hand, Sabba et al.66 presented Br− in the CsSnI3 lattice (i.e. CsSnI3−xBrx) and claimed that the Voc enhancement was attributed to the suppression of Sn2+ vacancies, reflected by the low carrier density in the resultant film. The best PCE of 1.76% was achieved for the CsSnI2.9Br0.1 device.
Meanwhile, chloride (Cl−) has also been introduced in the MASnIBr2 lattice by varying the SnCl2/SnBr2 ratios.160 Tsai et al.160 proposed that, due to the large difference of the radii of I− and Cl−, stable tri-halide perovskites (i.e. MASnIBr2−xClx) were formed only when x < 0.5. An optimum PCE of 3.11% was achieved for the MASnIBr1.8Cl0.2 device, which could be attributed to the fact that the high dielectric relaxation resistance in the device decreased the charge accumulation in the MASnIBr1.8Cl0.2 perovskite layer. Thus, it minimized carrier recombination at the CTL/perovskite interface. In addition, Cl− also improved the environmental stability of the MASnIBr1.8Cl0.2 device. After encapsulation, it maintained 90% of the initial PCE after being stored in a N2-filled glove box for 2000 hours, whereas the control device was degraded to 0% after 1200 hours.
Lee et al.68 reported that 25 mol% Br− in the FASnI3 lattice could reduce the carrier density in the perovskite film by 3 orders of magnitude, indicating that Br− in the halide position restricted the formation of Sn2+ vacancies. Thus, a PCE of 5.5% was achieved for the FASn(Br0.25I0.75)3 device, which exhibited excellent light stability. After encapsulation, it maintained >80% of the initial PCE after continuous one sun illumination in ambient air with a 25% relative humidity at 30 °C for 1000 hours.


6.2.4 Partial substitution in the X-site with inorganic anions. 
Recently, inorganic anions such as tetrafluoroborate (BF4−)61 and thiocyanate (SCN−)62 were introduced in the FASnI3 lattice for carbon mesoscopic solar cell application. BF4− significantly decreased the Sn4+ concentration in the FASnI3 film from 90% to 45%, which was beneficial for the suppression of trap assisted recombination in the device. Thus, the FASnI(BF4)2 device achieved the best PCE of 1.3%. In addition, BF4− also improved the environmental stability of the device. After encapsulation, the BF4−-treated device maintained >90% of the initial PCE after being exposed to dark ambient air with a 65% relative humidity for 1000 hours, whereas the control device was degraded to 0% after 700 hours. Meanwhile, the same group also added SCN− in the FASnI3 lattice. The authors found that SCN− could (i) lower Sn4+ concentration, (ii) increase carrier lifetime of the perovskite film and (iii) form a suitable energy level alignment between the perovskite and CTLs. Thus, a PCE of 2.4% was achieved for the FASnI(SCN)2 device, which could be attributed to the fact that SCN− suppressed the carrier recombination loss and enhanced carrier collection/extraction in the device. Besides, the FASnI(SCN)2 device with encapsulation also demonstrated higher environmental stability. It exhibited no PCE loss after being exposed to dark ambient air with a 65% relative humidity for nearly 2000 hours, whereas the control device completely failed within 500 hours.


6.2.5 Partial substitution in the A-site with organic cations and the X-site with halide anions. 
Yu et al.161 added methylammonium bromide (MABr) in the FASnI3 crystal lattice. More compact, larger perovskite grain size and higher crystallinity films were obtained with an increase of MABr composition up to x = 0.5. At an optimum composition of x = 0.25, MABr not only formed a suitable energy level alignment between the perovskite and CTLs, but also shifted the Fermi perovskite energy level towards the CBM, indicating stronger carrier transportability at the bi-interfaces and suppression of p-type doping. In addition, MABr improved the perovskite film morphology with better electrical properties (i.e. a longer carrier lifetime of 3.52 ns and a lower trap density of 3.58 × 1015 cm−3). According to the authors, MA+ controlled the orientated crystallization of the perovskite film, whereas Br− modulated the Eg of the perovskite. A PCE of 9.31% with negligible hysteresis was obtained for the MA0.25FA0.75SnI2.75Br0.25 device. The low hysteresis effect was attributed to MABr restrained ion movement and charge accumulation in the device due to a better energy level alignment between MA0.25FA0.75SnI2.75Br0.25 and CTLs. Meanwhile, the MA0.25FA0.75SnI2.75Br0.25 device also exhibited higher light soaking and thermal stabilities. The encapsulated MA0.25FA0.75SnI2.75Br0.25 device retained >80% of the initial PCE after continuous one sun illumination for 300 hours, resulting in a utilization temperature of 50 °C, whereas the control device completely failed within 120 hours.

6.3 Interface engineering
Interface engineering is critical in PSC application. It can be carried out by synthesizing the suitable CTL to replace the commonly used CTL or coating passivation layer at the perovskite/CTL interface with the aim to reduce energy barrier at the perovskite/CTL interface and improve their interfacial contact. In this subsection, we will discuss interface engineering at the perovskite/HTL interface, HTL/perovskite interface, perovskite/ETL interface and ETL/perovskite interface in detail.

6.3.1 Perovskite/HTL interface. 
Spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA HTLs normally contain hydroscopic additives and dopants such as tert-butylpyridine (t-BP), lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) salt, and cobalt complexes which could accelerate the degradation of Sn2+ based perovskite films under an oxygen atmosphere. To solve the problem, Ke et al.112 developed a low-cost and dopant free tetrakistriphenylamine (TPE) HTL (Fig. 20a), which showed a comparable hole mobility of (1.4 ± 0.1) × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a shallower HOMO/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of −4.99 eV/−2.22 eV compared to spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA HTLs under doping conditions. A PCE of 7.23% was achieved for the {en}FASnI3 device with the TPE HTL, which was higher compared to that obtained using spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA HTLs, which could be attributed to the more suitable band alignment and improved charge extraction efficiency to the anode. Without encapsulation, the TPE-treated device also exhibited higher environmental stability. It maintained >60% of the initial PCE after being exposed to ambient air with a 15% relative humidity for 1 hour.

In the following year, the same group synthesized benzodithiophene based organic small molecules, which contained di- and tetra-triphenyl amine donor HTLs (BDT-2D (Fig. 20b) and BDT-4D (Fig. 20c)).162 Compared to BDT-2D, the BDT-4D device exhibited a higher PCE of 7.59%, which could be attributed to the fact that a high hole mobility of 1.8 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 could facilitate hole transfer across the perovskite layer more readily and minimize carrier recombination in the device. Meanwhile, BDT-4D also improved the environmental stability of the device. Without encapsulation, it maintained 66.9% of the initial PCE after being stored in a N2-filled glove box for 14 months.


6.3.2 HTL/perovskite interface. 
Yu et al.92 reported poly[N,N′-bis(4-butylphenyl)-N,N′-bis(phenyl)benzidine] (poly-TPD) at the PEDOT:PSS/MASnI3 interface reduced carrier recombination loss in the device, but a low PCE of <2% was obtained for the optimized device. Later, Liu et al.114 intercalated polyethylene glycol (PEG) in the PEDOT:PSS HTL. With the addition of PEG, (i) the energy barrier was reduced, (ii) carrier recombination was suppressed and (iii) charge accumulation at the FASnI3/PEDOT:PSS interface was also suppressed. As a result, a PCE of 5.12% was achieved for the 0.2% PEG-treated device, which was almost 155% higher than that of the control device, which could be attributed to the fact that PEG improved hole injection/extraction from the FASnI3 perovskite layer to PEG–PEDOT:PSS. Meanwhile, PEG also improved the environmental stability of the device. Without encapsulation, the PEG-treated device could maintain >90% (>95%) after being exposed to dark ambient air (N2-filled glove box) for 4 hours (30 days).


6.3.3 ETL/perovskite interface. 
Due to the suitable CBM of zinc sulphide (ZnS) at the TiO2/FASnI3 interface, it has been used in PSC application.163 ZnS not only facilitated electron transfer from the FASnI3 perovskite layer to TiO2 more effectively compared to neat TiO2, but also suppressed the carrier recombination loss between free electrons relaxed at the CBM of TiO2 and free holes in the FASnI3 layer at the interface. Thus, the best PCE of 5.27% was obtained for the ZnS-treated device, whereas the control device showed a poor PCE of 3.69%.
Yang et al.164 reported C60 pyrrolidine tris-acid (CPTA) at the SnO2/{en}FASnI3 interface. Similar to ZnS,163 CPTA reduced the energy barrier loss at the SnO2/{en}FASnI3 interface during electron transfer from {en}FASnI3 to SnO2. As such, it suppressed the carrier recombination in the device and a PCE of 7.40% was achieved for the optimized device. Meanwhile, CPTA also improved the environmental stability of the device. Without encapsulation, the CPTA-treated device maintained 88% (80%) of its initial PCE after being stored in a N2-filled glove box (ambient air with a 60–70% relative humidity at 25 °C for 100 hours (200 minutes).
More recently, Yokoyama et al.165 reported that the energy difference between (i) the CBM of the ETL and the VBM of the Sn2+ perovskite and (ii) the electron affinity of the ETL and the Sn2+ perovskite (or defined as conduction band offset, ΔECBO) would significantly affect Voc of the device. Due to a large energy difference between the CBM of Nb2O5 and the VBM of FASnI3, as well as small ΔECBO, Nb2O5 could hinder the recombination of holes in FASnI3 with electrons in ETLs more readily compared to SnO2 and TiO2 (Fig. 21). As such, the device with the Nb2O5 ETL achieved the best PCE of 5.1%.

6.3.4 Perovskite/ETL interface. 
A higher PCE (higher stability) was obtained when C60 (PCBM) was used as the ETL for Sn2+ PSC application.166 For example, using a similar device fabrication method and storage conditions (i.e. N2 atmosphere), the device with the PCBM ETL exhibited a lower PCE of 1.43% but could maintain 60% of its initial PCE after 30 hours. In contrast, the device with the C60 ETL exhibited a higher PCE of 1.72% but showed a fast degradation process within the first few hours. On the other hand, Zeng et al.167 reported that poly(α-methylstyrene) (PAMS) at the FASnI3/PCBM interface filled up the pinholes and reduced interfacial defects in the FASnI3 film, without ruining the interior crystallinity of the perovskite film. As such, PAMS suppressed non-radiative trap assisted recombination in the FASnI3 film. In this work, the best PCE of 2.28% was achieved for the 0.5 mg mL−1 PAMS-treated device, whereas the control device achieved a poor PCE of 1.35%.
Kamarudin et al.168 reported that ethane-1,2-diamine (DAE) at the FA0.98EDA0.01SnI3/C60 interface suppressed both Sn2+ and I− vacancies in the FA0.98EDA0.01SnI3 film and induced the formation of a smooth FA0.98EDA0.01SnI3 film with larger perovskite grains. As a result, DAE (i) increased the carrier diffusion length, (ii) increased the carrier mobility and (iii) reduced the conductivity of the resultant film. A PCE of 9.37% was achieved for the 0.05 mM DAE-treated device, which was mainly contributed by the high Voc. In contrast, Jsc has no contribution to the device performance, which could be attributed to the fact that the insulating nature of DAE with an increase of coating concentration reduced charge injection from the perovskite layer to the ETL. Surprisingly, the PCE of the device could further increase to 10.18% after being stored in a N2 atmosphere for 7 days.
Liu et al.169 reported that poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) (EVA) at the FASnI3/PCBM interface retarded perovskite grain growth and facilitated preferred orientation in thermodynamics, which led to the formation of a pinhole free film with fewer defects and larger oriented grains. As such, it reduced the trap density from 1.18 × 1016 cm−3 to 8.66 × 1015 cm−3 and increased the carrier lifetime from 1.51 ns to 2.97 ns for the 2 mg mL−1 EVA-treated FASnI3 film. The interaction between the CO group and Sn2+ would form an intermediate adduct and prevented air-moisture from penetrating the FASnI3 perovskite layer (Fig. 22a), thereby reducing the Sn4+ concentration in the perovskite film. A PCE of 7.72% was achieved for the optimized device, which exhibited higher environmental stability in higher air humidity. Without encapsulation, the EVA-treated device could maintain almost 90% of its initial PCE after being stored in a N2-filled glove box for 800 hours, whereas the control device retained 50% of its initial PCE over a similar storage duration. In ambient air with a 60% humidity at 25 °C, the EVA-treated device maintained 62.4% of its initial PCE after 48 hours, whereas the control device completely failed within 12 hours.

On the other hand, He et al.170 reported that 4-fluorobenzohydrazide (FBH) at the FASnI3/C60 interface not only formed a dense and smooth film with a larger grain size, but also suppressed the Sn4+ concentration in the Sn2+ perovskite film. Under various oxygen concentration conditions, the Sn4+ concentration in FASnI3 films increased with large deviations in the order of 100 ppm O2 > 10 ppm O2 > 0.1 ppm O2, whereas similar trends but with small deviations were obtained for FBH-treated FASnI3 films, which were, however, lower compared to control films (Fig. 22b). As such, the carrier lifetime, doping density, and defect density of FBH-treated films increased from 3.87 ns to 4.58 ns, reduced from 5.16 × 1017 cm−3 to 4.21 × 1017 cm−3, and reduced from 9.19 × 1016 cm−3 to 8.37 × 1016 cm−3, respectively. An optimum PCE of 9.47% was achieved for the 0.5 mg mL−1 FBH-treated device under 0.1 ppm O2 conditions. Compared to the control device, it showed a much lower PCE decay rate after a few hours of dark and light-soaking measurements in 0.1 ppm O2 ambient air with a 20% relative humidity, which could be attributed to the fact that FBH could prevent oxygen absorption and permeation into the perovskite film and thus lower the destruction speed of the perovskite lattice. After encapsulation, it maintained over 93% of the initial PCE after continuous one sun illumination (i.e. light soaking) at the maximum power point in ambient air for 600 hours, whereas the control device maintained 43% of its initial PCE under similar conditions.
Liu et al.31 reported that the n-propylammonium iodide (PAI) layer on the FASnI3 film induced the template growth of FASnI3 crystals through the reconstruction of the intermediate phase, resulting in a highly crystallized and smooth perovskite film with preferential orientation along the (100) plane. Thus, the PAI-treated FASnI3 film exhibited better optoelectronic properties, such as a low defect density, a long carrier lifetime and a long electron diffusion length. A champion PCE (certified PCE) of 11.78% (11.22%) was achieved for the 2 mg mL−1 PAI-treated device. After encapsulation, it maintained over 95% of the initial PCE after 1000 hours of one sun illumination at the maximum power point tracking inside a N2-filled glove box, whereas the control device maintained only <40% of its initial PCE after 500 hours under similar working conditions.
Jin et al.171 reported that 3 mg mL−1 MACl and FACl on the FA0.75MA0.25SnI2.75Br0.25 surface enhanced the perovskite film crystallinity and suppressed the oxidation of Sn2+. Hence, MACl and FACl (i) reduced the hole trap state density from 3.45 × 1016 cm−3 (i.e. control film) to 1.77 × 1016 cm−3 (i.e. MACl-treated film) and 2.12 × 1016 cm−3 (i.e. FACl-treated film), (ii) increased the hole carrier mobility from 1.15 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (i.e. control film) to 3.61 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (i.e. MACl-treated film) and 2.43 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (i.e. FACl-treated film) and (iii) deepened the VBM of the perovskite, which formed a suitable energy level alignment between the perovskite and HTL and facilitated hole extraction. As such, MACl/FACl not only reduced trap assisted recombination and bimolecular recombination, but also enhanced charge transport in the device. PCEs of 8.07% and 7.92% were achieved for the MACl- and FACl-treated devices, respectively, whereas the control device achieved a poor PCE of 5.35%. Meanwhile, MACl and FACl also improved the environmental stability of the device. After encapsulation, both modified devices maintained 87% of their initial PCEs after being stored in a N2-filled glove box for 1000 hours, whereas the control device degraded to 53% of its initial PCE under similar storage conditions.

6.4 Solvent engineering
The film quality of Sn2+ based halide perovskites normally is poor (in terms of homogeneity and coverage) due to pinhole formation during the solution based deposition process. Therefore, solvent selection for dissolving Sn2+ based halide perovskites is critical for obtaining a high quality perovskite film using the spin-coating technique. Hao et al.172 investigated solvent effects on the crystallization of the MASnI3 perovskite film in a solution growth process. They found that the MASnI3 film derived from N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) crystallizes much more readily compared to other solvents (i.e. γ-butyrolactone (GBL), DMSO and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP)), as evidenced by a fast colour change of the film from yellow to dark brown during the spin-coating process. In contrast, colour change was not observed for the film derived from DMSO during the spin-coating process. A short period of thermal treatment was needed to obtain dark brown colour for this film. On the other hand, the film derived from NMP takes a longer time than that from DMSO to change its pale yellow colour to black. For the film derived from GBL, the black perovskite film was obtained in seconds after the spinning process without heat treatment. Among these solvents, the device derived from DMSO exhibited the best PCE of 3.15%, which could be attributed to the uniform, pinhole free and full surface coverage MASnI3 film on the mesoporous ETL, preventing the device from short circuits. It should be noted that the SnI2·3DMSO intermediate allowed I− ions to react with SnI2 in a controlled manner during the formation of the MASnI3 film, which was governed by the rate of the DMSO removal as a function of temperature. In contrast, the control device (DMF solvent-derived perovskite film) suffered short circuits, which could be attributed to the poor morphology/unfilled pinholes that led to a direct contact between the top metallic electrode and the FTO surface.
Greul et al.173 synthesized the MASnBr0.5I2.5 perovskite film with a less hazardous solvent (i.e. mixed methanol (MeOH) and 1,4-dioxane). Even though the Sn2+ perovskite film changed to black colour within a few seconds during the spinning process, it formed a dense and uniform film with no pinholes or large protruding crystals. A PCE of 1.05% with less hysteresis was obtained in this work.
Because the traditional IPA solvent in the two-step deposition approach could degrade the FASnI3 layer, Shahbazi et al.174 proposed a co-solvent system containing hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFP), isopropyl alcohol (IPA), and CBZ with a ratio of 5:5:2 to deposit the FAI layer on top of the SnI2/DMSO layer. In this work, HFP was used to form hydrogen bonds with IPA and FAI to retard FASnI3 crystal growth, whereas CBZ served as an antisolvent to extract residual DMSO in the first layer during the annealing process. The optimized device achieved the best PCE of 4.9% and exhibited excellent environmental stability. No obvious loss in PCE loss was observed after being stored in a glove box under dark conditions for more than 4000 hours.
Fujihara et al.175 dipped the as-prepared MASnI3 film in a beaker filled with the antisolvent derived from mixed solvents of TL and hexane (HX). By controlling the parameters such as antisolvent temperature and extraction speed, a flat, high surface coverage MASnI3 film was obtained. As such, the device achieved an average PCE of (2.14 ± 0.35)% with superior stability up to 200 hours under one sun illumination. It is well known that the main role of the antisolvent is to increase the supersaturation rate of the perovskite precursor so that the number of nucleation sites increases simultaneously.110 Without an antisolvent, the precursor solution was far from supersaturation until the solvent was evaporated completely. As a result, it formed a discontinuous perovskite film (i.e. flower-like grains) with low surface coverage. Therefore, the selection of antisolvent is also critical to obtain a uniform perovskite film with a lower number of pinholes. By using diethyl ether (DE) as an antisolvent, the number of pinholes and their size were larger than those of pinholes in the films dripped with TL. In contrast, the films dripped with CBZ have a uniform surface with full coverage and clear features of grains, which could be attributed to the fact that the high boiling point of CBZ at 130 °C with a low evaporation rate could extend the perovskite crystal growth duration during the thermal annealing process. Furthermore, CBZ also provided sufficient fluidity of the films for the neighbouring nuclei to form larger sized grains. As a result, a higher PCE of 9.06% was achieved for the device dripped with CBZ, which could be attributed to the fact that CBZ induced the formation of a high quality FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 film and suppressed carrier recombination in the device. After encapsulation, it retained 75% of the initial PCE after being stored in a N2-filled glove box for 30 days.110
On the other hand, Liu et al.176 showed that, by dripping the 65 °C CBZ solvent on the FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 film during the antisolvent dripping process, it increased the number density of nucleation site for perfect coverage of the perovskite film; by creating a mild DMSO atmosphere during the film annealing process, the grain size and uniformity of the perovskite film were enhanced simultaneously. As a result, the device achieved the best PCE of 7.2% and exhibited no PCE loss after a storage duration of 70 hours.
6.5 Treatment engineering
Wang et al.177 reported that the post-annealing treatment (PAT) at 150 °C enhanced the microstructural characteristics of the βγ-CsSnI3 perovskite film, forming flat polygonal grains with triple junction grain boundaries. Thus, the device achieved the best PCE of 3.31%. However, at a low temperature of <100 °C, abundant grain boundaries were formed in the perovskite film, resulting in severe electron–hole recombination in the device; at a high temperature of 300 °C, the grain coarsening process increased the number of Sn2+ vacancies and surface roughness in the perovskite film. On the other hand, Prabakar et al.178 reported that the formation of I− vacancies upon PAT could reduce the acceptor defects of polymorphic CsSnI3. They claimed that, at an annealing temperature of 150 °C, I− will interact with the Au metallic electrode to form AuI− and accumulated at the metal-interface, which would increase the diffusion of Au through the perovskite material itself. As a result, it deteriorated the device performance. In contrast to Wang et al.,177 they proposed that 60 °C was an optimum annealing temperature to process the CsSnI3 perovskite film, with the best PCE of <1%. Later, Roy et al.179 reported that 80 °C was an optimum annealing temperature for the fabrication of the MASnCl3 device, with a champion PCE of 3.41%.
Meanwhile, hydrazine vapour treatment (HVT) on the ASnX3 (A = MA+ and Cs+; X = I− and Br−) film has also been reported.180 The proposed method reduced >20% of the Sn4+/Sn2+ concentration in the ASnX3 film, which was beneficial for the suppression of carrier recombination in the device. As a result, MASnI3, CsSnI3 and CsSnBr3 based devices achieved the best PCEs of 3.89%, 1.83% and 3.04%, respectively.
Chowdhury et al.181 reported that the post-deposition vapour annealing (PDVA) treatment process assisted by MACl (Fig. 23a) enabled the formation of a highly stable, larger grain size, homogeneous and pinhole free FASnI3 film, whereas the FASnI3 film prepared using the normal annealing (NA) method showed non-uniform and non-homogeneous coverage with numerous pinholes. As a result, the device achieved a PCE of 6.33% with superior environmental stability. It maintained 88% of the initial PCE after being stored in a dark N2-filled glove box for 1000 hours, whereas the control device obtained using the NA method showed a fast degradation process.

Due to the high toxicity of the commonly used antisolvent during the Sn2+ perovskite film deposition process, Li et al.182 proposed an eco-friendly gas-pump treatment (GPT) method to fabricate the Sn2+ perovskite film, as illustrated in Fig. 23b. Initially, the ASnX3-coated CTL substrate was transferred into a low-pressure chamber. Then, the vacuum process was applied in the system to remove the remaining organic solvent to form uniform nuclei of the ASnX3 perovskite film. Finally, the sample was annealed to form a uniform and pinhole free ASnX3 film. It was found that the FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 film prepared using the GPT method exhibited a black, pinhole free and smooth film, whereas the control FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 film prepared using the conventional antisolvent spin-coating method was hazy and rough. As a result, the device obtained using the GPT method achieved a higher PCE of 1.85%, whereas the control device achieved a lower PCE of 1.15%. By using a similar method, Li et al.183 achieved a PCE of 2.0% for the CsSnI3 device. After being stored in a N2-filled glove box for 180 days, the PCE was increased to 3.8%, indicating that the gas-pump treatment could improve the device stability.
6.6 Perovskite dimensionality manipulation
One of the advantages of 2D perovskites is their high chemical stability due to the hydrophobic nature of large organic cations. Additionally, they suppress ionic migration and possess robust thermal stability. In this subsection, we will discuss the reduction of the Sn2+ perovskite dimension (i.e. 2D and 2D/3D structure) in detail.

6.6.1 2D Dion–Jacobson (D–J) Sn2+ based halide perovskites. 
The first 2D D–J Sn2+ PSC was based on (4AMP)(FA)3Sn4I13 as the absorber layer, with the optimum PCE of 4.33%. Encouragingly, only 9% loss in the PCE was observed for the device without encapsulation after it was stored in a N2 atmosphere at 45 °C for 100 hours. The authors claimed that the high stability of the (4AMP)(FA)3Sn4I13 device could be attributed to the strong interlayer bonding of the divalent 4AMP organic spacer molecule.184 Later, Li et al.185 inserted 1,4-butanediamine (BEA) in the FASnI3 film (i.e. (BEA)FAn−1SnnI3n+1). Due to the weak quantum confinement effect of the (BEA)FA2Sn3I10 film, BEA stabilized the LD perovskite structure and formed a barrier-free charge transport pathway in the D–J perovskite film. As a result, the (BEA)FA2Sn3I10 device achieved a higher PCE of 6.43%, whereas the control 3D device achieved a PCE of 4.20%. In addition, the (BEA)FA2Sn3I10 device was much more stable than the control 3D FASnI3 device, regardless of the environmental, thermal and light stabilities, as shown in Fig. 24a–d.

6.6.2 2D Ruddlesden–Popper (R–P) Sn2+ based halide perovskites. 
Cao et al.69 for the first time reported the 2D R–P (BA)2(MA)n−1SnnI3n+1 perovskite as the absorber layer for solar cell application. In this work, triethylphosphine (TEP) was used as an additive to suppress the oxidation of Sn2+, which improved the film morphology. The authors found that the orientation of the 2D film was highly dependent on the solvent used. If DMSO was used as a solvent, it induced parallel orientation of the 2D film to the planar substrate; if DMF was used as a solvent, it induced perpendicular orientation of the 2D film to the planar substrate. After optimization, the (BA)2(MA)3Sn4I13 device achieved the best PCE of 2.53% and demonstrated long-term operational stability. The encapsulated device maintained >90% of its initial PCE after 1 month, which dropped only to 50% after 4 months, which could be attributed to the high moisture resistance of hydrophobic BA chains.
To control the crystallization process of 2D R–P perovskite films, Qiu et al.186 utilized the solvent mixtures of DMSO and the ionic liquid methylamine acetate (MAAc) to prepare the BA2MA3Sn4I13 film. A PCE of 4.03% with excellent stability was achieved for the BA2MA3Sn4I13 device. No obvious loss in PCE was observed for the device after being stored in a N2 atmosphere for 94 days, which could be attributed to the fact that the solvent mixture method could suppress the oxidation of Sn2+ in the 2D film. Later, the same group187 reported that the bulky organic spacer cations of n-butylamine (BA+) and phenylethylamine (PEA+) could suppress the formation of the intermediate phase during the crystal growth of the 2D R–P perovskite film. Thus, the morphology and orientation of the 2D film were improved obviously. In addition, BA+ and PEA+ also suppressed carrier recombination and oxidation of Sn2+ in the 2D film markedly. After optimization, the (BA0.5PEA0.5)2FA3Sn4I13 device achieved an optimum PCE of 8.82% and exhibited better environmental stability. It maintained ≈60% of the initial PCE after being stored in a N2 atmosphere for 24 hours.
Xu et al.188 reported that ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) improved the crystallinity of the 2D R–P AVA2FA4Sn5I16 perovskite and induced the high vertical orientation of the 2D R–P perovskite film through the coordination interaction between Lewis base Cl− and Lewis acid Sn2+. In addition, NH4Cl also formed a pinhole free, uniform and compact 2D film with larger perovskite grains, which were beneficial for charge transport in the device and protect the 2D film from penetrating to air moisture and oxygen. As such, a PCE of 8.71% was achieved for the 10% NH4Cl-treated AVA2FA4Sn5I16 device with no obvious loss in PCE after being stored in a N2-filled glove box for 400 hours.
On the other hand, Li et al.70 compared butylamine (BA), octylamine (OA), and dodecylamine (DA) based 2D R–P perovskites in solar cell application. The authors found that BA with a shorter alkyl chain was more favourable to generate highly oriented crystal grains of the 2D R–P perovskite film and suppressed the Sn4+ concentration more readily compared to OA and DA 2D R–P films. Thus, a higher PCE of 4.16% was achieved for the BA2(FA)3Sn4I13 device. In contrast, OA2(FA)3Sn4I13 and DA2(FA)3Sn4I13 devices exhibited poor PCEs of 2.00% and 2.14%, respectively, which could be attributed to the dimensionality perovskite reduction and inferior structural distortion with an increase of the alkyl chain length. Without encapsulation, all these devices could maintain 80% of their initial PCEs after being stored in a N2-filled glove box for 14 days.


6.6.3 2D/3D PEA based Sn2+ based halide perovskites. 
Phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI) separated 3D FASnI3 into 2D nanolayers, forming low-dimensional 2D/3D (PEA)2(FA)n−1SnnI3n+1.189 Because PEAI could induce perpendicular orientation of the 2D/3D perovskite, it formed a uniform and smooth 2D/3D film, whereas the 3D FASnI3 film without PEAI exhibited a rough surface due to unbalanced perovskite crystal growth. Meanwhile, PEAI also increased the carrier mobility and reduced the carrier concentration in the 2D/3D film. In this work, the 2D/3D (PEA)2(FA)8Sn9I28 (i.e. 20% PEAI) device achieved the best PCE of 5.94% and demonstrated excellent environmental stability. Without encapsulation, it maintained 96% of the initial PCE after being stored in a N2 atmosphere for 100 hours, which could be attributed to the fact that the improved thermodynamic stability of the 2D/3D film has suppressed the oxidation of Sn2+ and the hydrophobic PEA molecules blocked oxygen diffusion into the perovskite crystal lattice.
Meanwhile, PEA190 has also been used as a seed layer to induce large scale crystallization and orientation of 3D FASnI3 grains. It fused with FASnI3 grains and blurred the grain boundaries, acting as a capping layer on the perovskite film surface. Thus, it suppressed the Sn2+ vacancies and background carrier density in the 2D/3D film. For example, the hole conductivity of the 2D/3D PEA2FA24Sn25I76 film (i.e. 2.1 × 10−4 S cm−1) was two orders of magnitude lower than that of the 3D FASnI3 film (i.e. 1.72 × 10−2 S cm−1). After optimization, a PCE of 9.0% was achieved for the 2D/3D PEA2FA24Sn25I76 device, which exhibited excellent light and environmental stabilities. The 2D/3D device showed no PCE loss after continuous one sun light illumination in a N2-filled glove box for 2 hours. In ambient air with a 20% relative humidity, it retained 59% of the initial PCE after 76 hours, whereas the 3D device completely failed.
Recently, the spin-coating method was used to deposit PEABr at the CTL/ASnX3 interface to form 2D/3D (PEA)2(FA)n−1SnnI3n+1.191,192 In their work, the authors proposed that 2D structure and 2D–3D mixture compounds were formed at and/or near the interface, whereas the upper perovskite away from the interface retained the 3D structure (Fig. 25a). Because of the defect formation during the deposition process of PEDOT:PSS, PEABr on the PEDOT:PSS surface therefore could passivate hole trap states and increase hole carrier extraction efficiency from the perovskite to HTL (Fig. 25b). Thus, a PCE of 7.05% was achieved for the 20 mg mL−1 PEABr-treated device.191 On the other hand, Liao et al.192 reported that PEABr at the FASnI3/PCBM interface (i) suppressed the phase separation induced by SnF2, (ii) reduced the Sn4+ concentration in the 2D/3D film and (ii) altered the energy level alignment, which led to more balanced charge transport in the device. As such, the 5 mg mL−1 PEABr-treated device achieved the best PCE of 7.86% and exhibited excellent light stability compared to the 3D FASnI3 device. The 2D/3D device maintained 80% of the initial PCE after continuous one sun illumination in ambient air for 350 hours, whereas the control 3D device completely failed within 150 hours under similar measurement conditions.

On the other hand, Li et al.19 obtained a dense and uniform 2D/3D FASnI3:PEACl film at an optimum annealing temperature of 100 °C. In addition, the authors found that the PCE of the 2D/3D device could further increase up to 9.1% after a few weeks of storage under control environmental conditions, which could be attributed to the fact that the PEA molecules in perovskite grain boundaries could act as passivation coating and prevent the 2D/3D film from oxidation.
Shao et al. reported that the 0.08 M ethylammonium iodide (EAI) additive in the PEA2FASn2I7:FASnI3 perovskite193 formed a more compact 2D/3D film with a lower number of pinholes. As such, the resultant 2D/3D film (i.e. E0.08-2D/3D) exhibited a lower carrier density of 2.00 × 1016 cm−3 (i.e. 4.37 × 1016 cm−3 for the control 2D/3D film) and a longer carrier recombination lifetime of 1.6 μs (i.e. 1.1 μs for the control 2D/3D film), which could be attributed to the fact that EAI reduced the number of electronic trap states and suppressed non-radiative trap assisted recombination in the 2D/3D film. As a consequence, the EA0.08-2D/3D device achieved the best PCE of 8.4%, whereas the control 2D/3D device achieved a PCE of 7.7%.
Besides, GeI2194 and FASCN195 additives have also been reported to improve the morphology and electrical properties (i.e. suppression of total trap density, carrier density, Sn2+ oxidation process and formed better device energy band alignment) of the 2D/3D Sn2+ perovskite film. After careful optimization, PCEs of 7.45% and 8.17% were obtained for the device obtained using 7.5 mol% GeI2 and 5 mol% of FASCN, respectively. Meanwhile, these additives also improved the device stability. Interestingly, the PCE of the GeI2-treated 2D/3D device could further improve to 7.57% after being stored in a N2-filled glove box for 192 hours, which could be attributed to the following: (i) the PEAI molecule encapsulated the 2D/3D perovskite layer, (ii) Ge+ passivated surface defects and (iii) the I− source from Ge2+ stabilized the SnI2 proportion. After continuous one sun illumination in ambient air for 3 hours, it maintained 70% of its initial PCE. For the FASCN-treated 2D/3D device without encapsulation, it maintained (i) 90% of the initial PCE after being stored in a N2-filled glove box for 1000 hours, (ii) 40% of the initial PCE after being exposed to ambient air with a 40% relative humidity at room temperature for 30 minutes and (iii) >90% of the initial PCE after continuous one sun illumination at the maximum power point inside a N2-filled glove box at 25 °C for 15 hours.
Later, Wang et al.196 achieved a higher PCE of 9.41% after 5% NH4SCN was added to the 2D/3D PEA0.15FA0.85SnI3 film, which could be attributed to the fact that NH4SCN enhanced the oxidation resistance, increased the carrier mobility and reduced the background carrier density in the resultant film. Furthermore, NH4SCN also improved the environmental (i.e. N2 atmosphere and ambient air), thermal and light stabilities of the device. Without encapsulation, it maintained >80% after being stored in a N2-filled glove box for 600 hours. In ambient air with a 75% relative humidity, it maintained 50% of the initial PCE within 150 hours, whereas the control 2D/3D device maintained 20% of its initial PCE within 120 hours. Under continuous 80 °C annealing in a N2-filled glove box, no PCE loss was observed for the NH4SCN-treated 2D/3D device within 100 hours, whereas the control 2D/3D device maintained 80% of its initial PCE within 100 hours. Under continuous one sun illumination in a N2 atmosphere, the NH4SCN-treated PEA0.15FA0.85SnI3 device maintained 70% of its initial PCE within 120 hours, whereas the control 2D/3D device maintained ≈55% within 120 hours. By replacing the PCBM ETL with the indene–C60 bisadduct (ICBA) ETL in a similar device structure,113 higher Voc (i.e. 0.60 V for PCBM and 0.94 V for ICBA) and PCE (i.e. PCE of 7.7% for PCBM and PCE of 12.4% for ICBA) were achieved, which could be attributed to the fact that the higher LUMO energy level of the ICBA ETL (i.e. −3.74 eV) led to the maximum attainable photovoltage and suppressed I− remote doping (for more details, refer to ref. 197) which reduced interface recombination (Fig. 26a and b). After encapsulation, it maintained 90% of the initial PCE after being stored in a N2-filled glove box for 3800 hours.

6.6.4 Other 2D/3D Sn2+ based halide perovskites. 
Nishimura et al.198 compared various types of cations, such as Na+, K+, Cs+, EA+ and BA+, in the FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 film. Because 10% EA+ possessed the lowest lattice strain of 0.85% and formed a 2D perovskite in the 3D FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 film (EA0.1(FA0.75MA0.25)0.9SnI3), it exhibited the highest PCE of 4.26% and increase to 5.46% after being stored in a N2-filled glove box for 4 days. In contrast, Na+ with the highest lattice strain of 3.46% exhibited the lowest PCE of 1.51%. According to the authors, a high lattice strain in the perovskite might disturb carrier collection and acted as a recombination centre in the device. Later, the same group32 achieved a PCE of 11.75% based on the GeI2-doped (FA1−xEAx)0.98EDA0.01SnI3 absorber layer. A high PCE attributed to 10% EA+ (i.e. x = 0.1) (i) aligned the perovskite energy level to match with the CTL, (ii) suppressed the defect and trap density, (iii) reduced the lattice disorder and (iv) formed better film morphology. As a result, the charge carrier density was suppressed by two orders to magnitude and the diffusion length was increased from 88.7 nm (i.e. x = 0) to 348 nm (i.e. x = 0.1), which was beneficial for charge transport in the device. By adding the ethylenediamine layer on the GeI2-doped (FA0.9EA0.1)0.98EDA0.01SnI3 film, the PCE of the device was further increased to 13.24%, which could be attributed to the formation of the 2D perovskite layer.
Ji et al.199 reported that the ethylammonium cation (EA+) in the MASnI3 film not only induced a vertically oriented 2D/3D EA0.4MA0.58SnI3 film (Fig. 27a), but also facilitated charge transport and retarded perovskite crystallization more effectively. With the addition of 40% EAI, a compact and uniform 2D/3D perovskite film was obtained (Fig. 27b–d). Thus, a PCE of 9.24% was achieved for the optimized device obtained using 40 mol% EAI, which could be attributed to the suppression of trap-assisted recombination in the device. Without encapsulation, the device retained 95% of its initial PCE after being stored in a glove box for 30 days.

Wu et al.200 fabricated the 2D/3D graded heterostructure (TFBA2SnI4)x(FASnI3)1−x film by dipping the 3D FASnI3 film in a chloroform solution containing bulky 4-(trifluoromethyl) benzyl ammonium cation salts (i.e. TFBA+, CF3C6H5CH2NH3+, 2 mg mL TFBAI), followed by thermal annealing treatment to promote the sequential exchange reaction between FA+ and bulky TFBA+. Owing to the steric effect of the bulky TFBA+ that could hinder further reaction inside the perovskite crystal, a wide bandgap 2D TFBA2SnI4 phase was formed. In addition, it also encapsulated and protected the 2D/3D perovskite film from interacting with air moisture from the surrounding, reduced pinholes at the perovskite grain boundaries and formed gradient band alignment at the perovskite/C60 interface. Benefiting from these, the TFBAI-treated film exhibited a longer carrier recombination lifetime of 6.61 ns, a lower charge extraction lifetime of 1.91 ns and a lower trap density of 3.86 × 1016 cm−3, as compared to the control 3D FASnI3 film. A PCE of 10.96% was achieved for the 2D/3D graded hetero-structure device. After 500 hours of continuous one sun illumination at the maximum power point in ambient air, no obvious loss in PCE was observed for the encapsulated 2D/3D device, whereas the control 3D device showed a 35% loss of the initial PCE after 500 hours. Under moisture and heat conditions (i.e. 60 °C with a 60% relative humidity), the encapsulated 2D/3D device showed PCE loss <5% after 100 hours, whereas the control 3D device showed about 22% PCE loss after the aging test. Without encapsulation, the 2D/3D device maintained 78% of its initial PCE after being exposed to ambient air for 100 hours, whereas the control 3D device completely failed after 40 hours. The authors claimed that the high stability of the 2D/3D device was attributed to the fact that the TFBA2SnI4 phase suppressed the decomposition of the perovskite crystal induced by heat or moisture due to its high formation energy.
More recently, Zhao et al.201 introduced a large allylammonium (ALA, CH2CH2CH3NH3+) cation in the FASnI3 film. Similar to other large organic cations, ALA merged with FASnI3 grain boundaries and formed a compact film with a larger grain size and high crystallinity. As such, it hindered the oxidation of Sn2+ and trap state formation. In this work, the (ALA)2(FA)24Sn25X76 device achieved the best PCE of 9.48% and exhibited superior environmental stability. It maintained (91.8 ± 0.29)% of the initial PCE after being stored in a N2-filled glove box for over 2400 hours.

7. Device engineering of single-junction APb1−xSnxX3 perovskite solar cells
APb1−xSnxX3 PSCs exhibit higher device performance of >20%, which can be attributed to the Eg of mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ films close to the optimal range in the S–Q maximum efficiency limit, and the Pb2+ element in ASnX3 improves the stability of the perovskite film. In the next subsections, device engineering (i.e. additive engineering, composition engineering, interface engineering, solvent engineering, treatment engineering and mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ perovskite dimensionality manipulation) will be discussed in detail for the fabrication of highly efficient and stable APb1−xSnxX3 PSCs. The device performance and stability evolutions of each strategy after optimization are listed in Table 2.

The first mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ halide PSC was reported by Hayase and co-workers in 2014.33 With the addition of PbI2 in the MASnI3 film, it (i) suppressed the oxidation of Sn2+, (ii) decreased carrier concentration, (iii) formed a suitable energy level alignment between the perovskite and CTLs and (iv) improved the environmental stability of the mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ film in ambient air. The absorption edge of the films was shifted from 1000 nm to 1200 nm with the increase of x, from 0.3 to 1.0, which was longer than that of the MAPbI3 film but shorter than that of the MASnI3 film. A PCE of 4.18% was achieved for the MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 device, which could be attributed to the improved carrier extraction and collection to respective electrodes. Hao et al.18 reported that a low Sn2+ concentration was beneficial for device performance, with an optimum PCE of 7.37% for the MAPb0.75Sn0.25I3 device. By reducing the Sn2+ concentration to x = 0.15 (i.e. MAPb0.85Sn0.15I3−xClx), a PCE of 10.10% was achieved in the planar type inverted structure, which could be attributed to the fact that the better surface morphology enhanced the carrier transport in the device. On the other hand, Zuo et al.202 reported that the annealing treatment condition is important to achieve a high quality of mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ halide perovskite films. Zhao et al.203 utilized Sn2+ powder as the Sn2+ source to fabricate MAPb1−xSnxI3 films, rather than the conventional SnX2 material in the MAPbI3 precursor solution. The authors removed each one-sixth of the mixed solution during each deposition process. A PCE of 12.46% and a higher photovoltage of 1.0 V were achieved for the device derived from MAPb1−xSnxI3 solution after 12 hours, equivalent to MAPb0.95Sn0.05I3, as confirmed by the XPS spectra. Lee et al.204 achieved a PCE of 13.40% for the MAPb0.4Sn0.6I2.6Br0.4 device, which could be attributed to the better film morphology. The authors claimed that the Sn2+ concentration at x > 0.6 or x < 0.6 in MAPb1−xSnxI2.6Br0.4 films would form poor surface coverage with lots of pinholes. Yin et al.205 reported a high PCE of 18.25% for the MAPb0.9Sn0.1I3 device. The device also exhibited long-term operational stability in ambient air and under continuous light-soaking inside a N2-filled glove box.
On the other hand, Liu et al.206 reported the use of the FAPb1−xSnxI3 film in solar cells. They found that a small concentration of Sn2+ could stabilize the FAPbI3 perovskite phase and its thermal stability. For example, the annealed FAPb0.9Sn0.1I3 film at 100 °C displayed black colour. In contrast, the FAPbI3 film displayed yellow colour and then changed to black until the temperature has reached 150 °C, which was a sign of perovskite phase transformation (Fig. 28a). Additionally, the FAPb1−xSnxI3 films also exhibited higher thermal stability and remained in black colour after annealing at 150 °C for 4 hours (Fig. 28b). A PCE of 10.76% was achieved for the FAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 device and maintained over 85% of the initial PCE after being stored in a N2-filled glove box for 100 hours.

Liang et al.207 fabricated the CsPb0.9Sn0.1IBr2 film through a two-step sequential solution-phase process in ambient air and achieved a PCE of 11.33% based on hole-conductor free carbon mesoscopic PSCs. No PCE loss was observed for the encapsulated device after being stored at room temperature for more than 3 months. Surprisingly, the device could operate normally after being continuously heated at 100 °C for more than 2 weeks. Without encapsulation, the CsPb0.9Sn0.1IBr2 device also exhibited high moisture resistance. It maintained 85% of the initial PCE after being exposed to ambient air with a 50–60% relative humidity at room temperature for 50 hours, which showed superior stability compared to CsPbI3 and CsPbI2Br based devices. Li et al.208 synthesized CsPb1−xSnxIBr2 films (0 < x < 1) using a one-step antisolvent method at a low temperature of 150 °C. The films changed colour from orange to dark brown with an increase of the Sn2+ molar proportion (Fig. 29). Among these series, CsPb0.75Sn0.25IBr2 showed the most homogeneous and dense crystallized morphology. A champion PCE of 11.5% was achieved for the CsPb0.75Sn0.25IBr2 device, which exhibited higher light and environmental stabilities compared to the CsPbIBr2 device. The authors explained that the high efficiency and stability of the CsPb0.75Sn0.25IBr2 device were due to the fact that the Sn2+ substitution altered the driving force for phase segregation and increased the barrier for ionic diffusion, which enhanced the phase stability.

Yang et al.209 reported that the 0.3 mole Sn2+ in the CsPbI3 film not only formed a pinhole free and better surface coverage film, but also maintained the black color of the perovskite phase in ambient air for several hours. In this work, the CsPb0.7Sn0.3I3 device achieved an optimum PCE of 9.41% and exhibited long-term operational stability. It maintained 94.86% of the initial PCE after continuous one sun illumination in a N2-filled glove box for 168 hours. Under a N2 atmosphere (ambient air), it maintained >97% (87%) of the initial PCE for almost 6 months (22 hours).
Zhu et al.210 reported that the mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ film obtained using the galvanic displacement reaction (GDR) method exhibited higher operational stability in ambient air and suppressed the oxidation of Sn2+ more readily compared to the control film derived from the conventional perovskite precursor solution by mixing metal halides and organic–inorganic halides such as PbI2, SnI2, MAI, FAI and CsI. A PCE of 18.21% was achieved for the (FAPb0.6Sn0.4I3)0.85(MAPb0.6Sn0.4Br3)0.15 device, which exhibited excellent environmental and thermal stability. After encapsulation, the device obtained using the GDR method maintained over 90% of the initial PCE after being exposed to ambient air with a 50–60% relative humidity at room temperature (after being annealed at 80 °C in ambient air with a 50–60% relative humidity) for 1000 hours (for 120 hours). On the other hand, Klug et al.211 reported that a <1% Sn2+ concentration in FA0.83Cs0.17Pb1−xSnxI3 created trap sites and promoted non-radiative recombination in the films. At higher Sn2+ concentrations in the range of 0.5% to 20%, it induced poor optoelectronic quality in the perovskite films; as the Sn2+ concentration was increased to >30%, it improved the optoelectronic quality in the perovskite films. After careful optimization, a PCE of 18.1% was achieved for the (FA0.83Cs0.17)(Pb0.5Sn0.5)I3 device. Ji et al.212 fabricated triple organic–inorganic cation Cs0.05FA0.79MA0.16Pb0.664Sn0.336I2.48Br0.52 films and achieved a PCE of 16.10%, which could be attributed to the better energy level alignment between the perovskite and CTLs and suppressed the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+. After being exposed to ambient air for 30 days, it could retain 93% of the initial PCE.
7.1 Additive engineering

7.1.1 Sn(II) halide materials (SnF2). 
Zong et al.213 presented a Lewis-adduct additive (i.e. SnF2·FACl) in solution processing of the FA0.7Cs0.3Pb0.7Sn0.3I3 film. During annealing process of the perovskite film, SnF2·FACl was converted to SnF2 and coated along the perovskite grain boundaries, as well as coarsening perovskite grain size. As such, it not only passivated the FA0.7Cs0.3Pb0.7Sn0.3I3 film, but also formed an encapsulation layer for each perovskite grain at the nanoscale. Compared to the control film, the treated film exhibited low Urbach energy and trap filled limited voltage, which could be attributed to the fact that SnF2·FACl suppressed the defect density and Sn2+ vacancies of the resultant film. The best PCE of 15.8% was achieved for the optimized device. Meanwhile, SnF2·FACl also improved the environmental stability of the device. It retained over 90% of the initial PCE after being exposed to ambient air with a 20% relative humidity at room temperature and stored in a N2-filled glove box for 288 hours, whereas the control device showed a fast degradation process.
Similar results were obtained when SnF2.FACl was introduced in the CsPb0.6Sn0.4I3 film.214 To further improve the device performance, (aminomethyl) piperidinium diiodide (4AMP)I2 was introduced on the SnF2·FACl-treated CsPb0.6Sn0.4I3 surface. A PCE of 13.37% was achieved for the optimized device, which demonstrated long-term operational stability. Without encapsulation, the device exhibited no PCE loss after being (i) stored in a N2-filled glove box at room temperature for 2800 hours and (ii) exposed to dry ambient air with a <20% relative humidity for 2–3 hours every 3–4 days up to 1000 hours. Under continuous one sun illumination inside a N2-filled glove box at 45 °C, it maintained 71% of the initial PCE after 1000 hours.
Besides, the [SnF2(DMSO)]2 complex additive has also been used to fabricate the FA0.6MA0.4Pb0.4Sn0.6I2.7Br0.3 film.215 It reduced the defect density and enhanced the carrier transport in the device. Thus, the PCE was increased to 15.93% from 7.04%. More importantly, the treated device also exhibited long term operational stability with less degradation after being stored in a dark glove box for 13 days.


7.1.2 Organic additives. 
Similar to the SnF2 additive, the ascorbic acid (AA) additive109 not only modulated binary perovskite crystallization during the perovskite film deposition process, but also slowed down the formation of Sn4+ in the mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ precursor solution/film. This was evidenced by a longer photogenerated lifetime (i.e. 187.2 ns) and a lower trap state density (i.e. 1.33 × 1016 m−3) for the AA-treated MA0.5FA0.5Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 film, whereas the SnF2-treated MA0.5FA0.5Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 film exhibited a shorter photogenerated lifetime of 92.5 ns and a higher trap state density of 1.79 × 1016 m−3. As a result, a PCE of 14.01% was achieved for the AA-treated device, whereas the SnF2-treated device achieved a lower PCE of 12.18%. Furthermore, AA also improved the environmental stability of the device. No obvious PCE loss was observed after being stored in a N2-filled glove box for 1 month. In contrast, the SnF2-treated device retained 63% of its initial PCE under similar storage conditions.
Meanwhile, C60 has also been used as an additive to prepare the MAPb0.75Sn0.25I3 film using a two-step sequential deposition method.216Fig. 30a shows the roles of the C60 additive during the MAPb0.75Sn0.25I3 film formation. Briefly, PbI2 and SnI2 in the DMSO solvent formed a PbI2/SnI2 (DMSO)x complex. Due to the large binding energy of the C60 and DMSO molecules, C60 was wrapped by DMSO and mixed with the PbI2/SnI2 (DMSO)x complex. There was a molecule exchange process between DMSO and MAI during the MAI deposition process on the PbI2/SnI2 film. During the annealing process, DMSO was evaporated and the MAPb0.75Sn0.25I3 film was nucleated. At the same time, C60 starts to distribute evenly in the perovskite grain boundaries. As such, the binding energy between C60 and DMSO altered perovskite grain growth and led to the formation of a high-quality MAPb0.75Sn0.25I3 film with a lower number of pinholes (Fig. 30b and c). At an optimum C60 doping concentration of 0.05 mg mL−1, the device achieved a higher PCE of 13.9% (average PCE of (13.7 ± 0.2)%) than the control device without the C60 additive. Without encapsulation, the C60-treated MAPb0.75Sn0.25I3 device also exhibited long-term environmental stability after being exposed to ambient air for 7 days, which could be attributed to the fact that C60 distributed at the grain boundaries functions as a raincoat to prevent moisture permeation (Fig. 30d).

With the addition of the ammonium thiocyanate (MASCN) additive, Lian et al.217 obtained good surface coverage of the FAPb0.7Sn0.3I3 film and a larger perovskite grain size up to 700 nm, which led to the improvement of charge transport and decreased non-radiative recombination in the FAPb0.7Sn0.3I3 film. Meanwhile, the SCN− of MASCN could form coordination with Sn2+ and suppressed Sn2+ vacancies in the FAPb0.7Sn0.3I3 film. For example, the MASCN-treated FAPb0.7Sn0.3I3 precursor solution maintained its light yellow colour within 30 minutes in ambient air and changed to orange colour after 50 minutes, whereas the FAPb0.7Sn0.3I3 precursor solution turned to orange colour after 2 minutes of exposure to ambient air. A PCE of 14.34% was achieved for the 0.25 M MASCN-treated device. When combined with the 2D PEAI layer, the PCE was further increased to 16.26% with a less hysteresis effect, which could be attributed to the larger Fermi-level splitting, defect passivation and suppression of non-radiative recombination in the resultant film. Furthermore, the device without encapsulation derived from both the MASCN additive and PEAI capping layer also exhibited higher environmental stability. It exhibited PCE loss after being stored in a N2-filled glove box for 30 days.
Meanwhile, {en} has also been used as an additive to prepare the mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ halide perovskite film.64 In contrast to ASnI3,151,152 {en} does not occupy the A-site position of the mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ halide perovskite film. It (i) improved the film morphology (i.e. small perovskite grain size, pinhole free, smooth and low surface roughness film), (ii) suppressed the trap density and (iii) enhanced the carrier lifetime in the FA0.5MA0.5Sn0.5Pb0.5I3 film, resulting in high Voc and FF in the device. As a result, a PCE of 13.19% was achieved for the optimized device obtained using 5% {en}. Without encapsulation, it maintained 92% (28%) of the initial PCE after being exposed to ambient air with a 10–30% relative humidity at room temperature for 25 hours (122 hours), whereas the control device maintained only 18% of the initial PCE after 25 hours. By adding 5 mg mL−1 MABr on the FA0.5MA0.5Sn0.5Pb0.5I3 surface, the PCE was further increased to 17.04%, which could be attributed to the fact that the better energy band alignment and longer carrier lifetime (i.e. 59.2 ns) in the resultant film improved the charge transport and reduced the carrier recombination in the device. Compared to the 5% {en} device, the (5% {en} + MABr) device demonstrated higher environmental stability. It maintained 40% of the initial PCE after being exposed to ambient air with a 10–30% relative humidity at room temperature for 122 hours.
Ban et al.218 proposed the use of tea polyphenol (TP) as an additive to prepare the CsPb0.5Sn0.5I2Br film. Because the hydrobenzene group of TP molecules could slow down the oxidation of Sn2+, the chemical stability of the resultant film was improved. For example, the 0.5% TP-treated film maintained initial dark brown colour after being exposed to ambient air for 6 hours, whereas the control film turned to yellow colour (Fig. 31). In addition, the coordination interaction between TP and CsPb0.5Sn0.5I2Br led to a compact, larger grain size and pinhole free film. As a result, the carrier lifetime of the resultant film was increased from 5.47 ns to 9.67 ns. A PCE of 8.10% was achieved for the optimized device, which demonstrated higher operational stability. Without encapsulation, the optimized device retained 94% of the initial PCE after being stored in a N2-filled glove box for 60 days. Under one-sun illumination in a N2-filled glove box at the maximum power point, it maintained 90.1% of its initial PCE for 200 hours.

Zhou et al.219 reported that 12% guanidinium bromide (GABr) in the FA0.7MA0.3Pb0.7Sn0.3I3 film enlarged the perovskite grain size, formed a compact film and suppressed the formation of Sn2+ vacancies in the resultant film. As such, it facilitated the hole transport and suppressed the carrier recombination in the FA0.7MA0.3Pb0.7Sn0.3I3 film markedly, resulting in a longer carrier lifetime of 821 ns. A PCE of 20.63% (certified PCE of 19.80%) was achieved for the 12% GABr-treated FA0.7MA0.3Pb0.7Sn0.3I3 device, whereas the control device exhibited a poor PCE of 16.71%. Meanwhile, GABr improved the device stability. Without encapsulation, the GABr-treated device maintained over 85% (over 90%) of the initial PCE after being exposed to air with a 50–60% humidity (being heated at 80 °C in air with a 50–60% humidity) for 1000 hours (24 hours).


7.1.3 Inorganic additives. 
Inorganic ZnI2220 increased the carrier lifetime (i.e. >1 μs) and led to uniform mixing of Pb2+ and Sn2+ in the FAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 film, yielding a high PCE of 12.7% for the 1% ZnI2-treated device. On the other hand, Yang et al.221 reported that 0.03 mol% cadmium (Cd) reduced the trap state density and background carrier concentration in the FA0.5MA0.45Cs0.05Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 film, resulting in a longer electron diffusion length of (2.72 ± 0.15) μm and a longer carrier lifetime of (1450 ± 160) ns. In this work, the optimized device achieved the best PCE of 20.3%.
Other groups reported the use of Sn2+ powder as an additive to prepare the mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ halide perovskite.34,222 Prior to the deposition process, the Sn2+ powder was filtered out from the perovskite precursor solution. The authors found that Sn2+ powder not only could form a pinhole free film with vertically oriented perovskite grains, but could also improve the electrical properties of the resultant film, such as an improved carrier diffusion length, an enhanced carrier lifetime, an improved carrier mobility, a suppressed hole trap density and a suppressed hole concentration. Meanwhile, the Sn2+ powder also stabilized the mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ halide perovskite precursor solution in ambient air for a few weeks. A PCE of 21.1% (certified PCE of 19.53%) was achieved for the optimized device obtained using a 860 nm thick MA0.3FA0.7Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 absorber layer.35 On the other hand, Jiang et al.222 carried out a similar work and applied it on a 800 nm thick MA0.4FA0.6Pb0.4Sn0.6I3 absorber layer. The authors obtained similar results as reported by Lin et al.:35 the Sn2+ metallic powder (i) reduced the carrier trap density, (ii) increased the carrier lifetime in the mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ film and (iii) altered the energy band alignment between the perovskite and CTLs. A PCE of 20.7% was achieved for the optimized device, which exhibited excellent stability. It maintained >95% of the initial PCE after being stored in a N2-filled glove box for almost 2 months.

7.2 Composition engineering

7.2.1 Partial substitution in the A-site with organic cations. 
Yang et al.223 introduced FA+ in the MAPb0.75Sn0.25I3 lattice. Jsc and FF increased with the increase of FA+ concentration up to 50%. A PCE of 14.19% was achieved for the MA0.5FA0.5Pb0.75Sn0.25I3 device. Interestingly, the MA0.5FA0.5Pb0.75Sn0.25I3 device could maintain 80% (>94%) of the initial PCE after being exposed to ambient air with a 30–40% relative humidity (N2 atmosphere) for 12 days (30 days), which could be attributed to the fact that the perovskite with a dense crystalline domain hindered oxygen diffusion in the perovskite film and the suppression of Sn2+ vacancies by FA+. In the same year, the same group60 reported that the substitution of MA+ with Cs+ significantly affected the MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 film morphology: at a low doping concentration of 10–20 mol% Cs+, it formed homogeneous morphology with uniform crystal domains, which could be attributed to the fact that Cs+ modulated the perovskite film formation by reducing its crystallization rate; at a higher doping concentration of 30 mol% Cs+, the phase separation induced poor morphology. Interestingly, no oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ in the CsxMA1−xPb0.5Sn0.5I3 film was observed after being exposed to ambient air for 3 days, whereas the control film exhibited the oxidation of Sn2+ after being exposed to ambient air for 1 day. The best PCE of 10.07% was achieved for the MA0.9Cs0.1Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 device. In addition, Cs+ also improved the light, thermal and environmental stability of the Cs+-doped device. Meanwhile, the authors also added 0.2 mol% Cs+ in the FAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 film (i.e. FA0.8Cs0.2Pb0.5Sn0.5I3) and a higher PCE of 11.6% was achieved.
On the other hand, Kapil et al.224 reported that Cs+ significantly reduced the surface and bulk trap densities in (CsxFA1−xSnI3)0.5(MAPbI3)0.5 films due to the low lattice strain and Urbach energy of the resultant films. A PCE of 20.4% was achieved for the Cs0.025FA0.475MA0.5Pb0.5SnI3 device.


7.2.2 Partial substitution in the X-site with halide anions. 
2.5% Cl− in the (FASnI3)0.6(MAPbI3)0.4 film induced a larger perovskite grain size with a lower number of horizontal grain boundaries and suppressed the defect trap density (i.e. low Urbach energy) in the (FASnI3)0.6(MAPbI3)0.4 film.225 As a result, it increased the hole mobility and carrier lifetime of the resultant film. For example, the hole mobility was increased from (27 ± 2) cm2 V−1 s−1 to (40 ± 5) cm2 V−1 s−1, whereas the carrier lifetime was increased from 172 μs to 292 μs. A PCE of 18.40% was achieved for the optimized device obtained using 2.5% Cl−. Later, the same group introduced Br− in the (FASnI3)0.6(MAPbI3)0.4 film.226 They found that Br− passivated the grain boundaries, improved the perovskite crystallinity and reduced the dark saturation current density. However, it induced larger Eg and higher Urbach energy with the increase of Br− concentration, which could deteriorate the device performance. After optimization, the (FASnI3)0.6(MAPbI3)0.4(MAPbBr3)0.06 device achieved the best PCE of 19.03%.
Lee and co-workers reported that Br− in the MASn0.6Pb0.4I3 film formed a highly crystalline film with a larger grain size.227 Because the Br−-treated film exhibited a densely packed crystalline structure and void-free surface coverage, it suppressed trap assisted recombination. Thus, a higher PCE of 12.1% was obtained for the MASn0.6Pb0.4I2.6Br0.4 device, as compared to the control device (i.e. MASn0.6Pb0.4I3) with a lower PCE of 9.2%.

7.3 Interface engineering

7.3.1 HTL/perovskite interface. 
Tang et al.115 reported that the perfluorinated ionomer (PFI) in PEDOT:PSS solution at a volume ratio of 1:16 minimized the energy barrier at the PEDOT:PSS/(FASnI3)0.6(MAPbI3)0.4 interface, thanks to the high ionization potential of the fluorinated sulfonic acid in PFI which induced a larger dipole moment on the surface of the PEI-doped PEDOT:PSS film. The work function of PEDOT:PSS has shifted downward from −5.02 eV to −5.19 eV, which matched well with the VBM of (FASnI3)0.6(MAPbI3)0.4 (i.e. −5.22 eV). As a result, it hindered charge accumulation at the PEDOT:PSS/(FASnI3)0.6(MAPbI3)0.4 interface and suppressed recombination loss, with a longer carrier recombination lifetime of 4.27 ms. The optimized device achieved the best PCE of 15.85%.
Meanwhile, the bulk heterojunction PBDB-T:ITIC organic semiconductor (i.e. 15 nm thick with a concentration of 3 mg mL−1) has also been reported to modify the PEDOT:PSS surface.228 Owing to the high lying LUMO energy level and hydrophobicity of the BHJ organic semiconductor, it blocked electrons from recombining with holes at the PBDB-T:ITIC/perovskite interface. With the addition of the BHJ layer, a compact mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ film with a larger grain size and negligible grain boundaries was obtained, yielding a low trap state density at the interface or in the perovskite film. As a result, the device achieved a champion PCE of 18.03%. Without encapsulation, the device with the BHJ organic semiconductor in a N2-atmosphere maintained 80% of its initial PCE after 600 hours, whereas the PCE of the control device degraded to 31% under similar storage conditions. In this work, the long term operational stability of the device could be attributed to the PBDB-T:ITIC encapsulated acidic PEDOT:PSS HTL and it prevented PEDOT:PSS from reacting with the mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ perovskite film.
On the other hand, Zhang et al.229 reported that hydroquinone (HQ) minimized the hole transport barrier at the PEDOT:PSS/(MAPbI3)0.7(FASnI3)0.3 interface and improved the interfacial contact between the perovskite and PEDOT:PSS, resulting in better hole extraction from the perovskite to HTL. In addition, HQ also facilitated perovskite film growth, thereby reducing the defect states in the perovskite film. As such, a PCE of 14.65% was obtained. After being stored in a N2 environment for 22 days, the HQ-treated device without encapsulation maintained 93% of its initial PCE, whereas the control device maintained 88% of its initial PCE under the same storage conditions.
Shao et al.230 proposed the use of the anionic conjugated polymer PCP–Na as the HTL. Compared to PEDOT:PSS, PCP–Na formed a more compact, homogeneous, smooth and low surface roughness film on an ITO substrate, which was beneficial for better interfacial contact with the mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ perovskite and reduced the number of trap states in the device. Furthermore, the high work function of PCP–Na (i.e. −5.2 eV) matched well with the VBM level of the FAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 film (i.e. −5.6 eV), which enlarged the built-in potential and improved the charge extraction efficiency in the device. Interestingly, the device performance was independent of the thickness of PCP–Na but was highly dependent on the device active area. After optimization, the device achieved the best PCE of 16.27%, whereas the control device obtained using the PEDOT:PSS HTL exhibited a lower PCE of 11.60%.
By replacing the PEDOT:PSS HTL with a 30 nm NiOx thick HTL,231 a PCE of 17.25% was achieved for the FAPb0.75Sn0.25I3 device, which could be attributed to the following reasons: the NiOx HTL (i) formed a pinhole free, continuous film with a larger perovskite crystal size up to 1 μm and (ii) enhanced charge extraction to respective electrodes. Without encapsulation, the NiOx device maintained 91% (92%) of its initial PCE after being stored in a N2-atmosphere at 80 °C (room temperature) for 20 hours (46 days). Later, a higher PCE of 17.6% was obtained for the inverted device structure, with NiOx as the HTL and Cs0.1MA0.2FA0.7Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 as the absorber layer.232 Interestingly, no obvious loss in PCE was observed for the device after being stored in a N2 atmosphere under dark conditions for 102 days.


7.3.2 ETL/perovskite interface. 
Liu et al.116 introduced the self-assembled monolayer, C60-SAM, to reduce the energy offset between the CBM of FA0.5MA0.5Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 (i.e. −4.0 eV) and SnO2 (i.e. −4.5 eV). The addition of C60-SAM induced higher crystallinity of the perovskite film but had no impact on the film morphology. Furthermore, the carboxyl end-groups in C60-SAM could strongly bond with SnO2 and passivated the SnO2 defect surface, which reduced the trap density of the mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ film from 3.1 × 1015 cm−3 to 2.0 × 1015 cm−3. As a result, the C60-SAM-treated device achieved a higher PCE of 9.0% and a higher Voc of 0.48 V, whereas the control device (i.e. SnO2/perovskite) exhibited a lower PCE of 5.7% and a lower photovoltage of 0.35 V. More interestingly, when the ZnO ETL with a CBM of −4.4 eV was introduced at the ITO/C60-SAM-coated SnO2 interface, the recombination lifetime of free carriers was further increased from 22.8 μs to 36.6 μs, which could be attributed to the fact that the small energy offset between the work function of the ITO electrode (−4.7 eV) and the CBM of C60-SAM-coated SnO2 (−4.1 eV) has improved electron extraction and retarded interface carrier recombination. As a result, the PCE and Voc have increased to 13.8% and 0.66 V, respectively. Besides, the ZnO/SnO2/C60-SAM/perovskite device also exhibited higher environmental stability compared to the SnO2/perovskite device.
Meanwhile, C60-COOH has also been used to (i) avoid the direct contact between the TiO2 ETL and the mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ perovskite (i.e. MAPb0.7Sn0.3I3) and (ii) prevent the formation of Ti–O–Sn bonds that might act as traps/recombination centers. With the addition of C60-COOH at the TiO2/MAPb0.7Sn0.3I3 interface, the PCE has improved from 5.14% to 7.91%.233


7.3.3 Perovskite/ETL interface. 
Fullerene and fullerene derivatives have widely been used to boost mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ photovoltaic properties. In 2016, Lin et al.234 investigated fullerene (i.e. C60) and fullerene derivatives (i.e. BPB-M, PCBM, BPB-B, BPB-T and ICBA) in MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 solar cell application. Among these ETLs, the BPB-M ETL device exhibited the best PCE of 10.24%.
In the following year, Rajagopal et al.235 coated fluoroalkyl-substituted fullerene (DF-C60) (i.e. 6 mg mL−1 in TL solvent) on the MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 surface (i.e. MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 film/DF-C60/C60) during the antisolvent dripping process. Due to the better surface morphology of the DF-C60-treated MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 film, it suppressed the trap density and reduced non-radiative trap assisted recombination in the device. As such, the PCE (Voc) of the device raised from 11.39% (0.69 V) to 13.46% (0.73 V). In addition, the DF-C60 device improved the environmental stability of the device, which could be attributed to the fact that the perfluoroalkyl groups in DF-C60 near the MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 film surface could slow down the penetration of air moisture to the perovskite film. By replacing the C60 ETL with the IC60BA ETL, the PCE and Voc of the device further increased to 15.61% and 0.89 V, respectively.
Kapil et al.236 reported that the spike structure of PCBM at the FA0.5MA0.5Pb0.5Sn0.5I3/C60 interface increased the activation energy for carrier recombination at the interface, resulting in a longer recombination lifetime of 142.8 ms. Thus, a higher PCE of 17.59% and a higher photovoltage of 0.75 V were obtained for the 5 mg mL−1 of PCBM-treated device with its optimum thickness of 25 nm.
Du et al.237 introduced a quaternary ammonium halide compound, Me4NBr, at the (FASnI3)0.6(MAPbI3)0.4/PCBM interface to passivate the perovskite surface and prevent carrier recombination in the perovskite film. Even though the Me4NBr-treated perovskite film appeared to be more textured with many small particles attached on the big grains, it reduced the electron-trap density of the perovskite film. The optimized device achieved a PCE of 13.97% and demonstrated long-term operational stability.
Guo et al.238 reported that the MACl layer on the FA0.75Cs0.25Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 film decreased the vertical grain boundaries and trap sites in the resultant film, thereby suppressing non-radiative electron–hole recombination. In this work, the device prepared using 5 mg mL−1 MACl achieved the best PCE of 14.03% and maintained 80% of its initial PCE after being stored for 30 days in a N2-filled glove box.
Li et al.239 fabricated a perovskite-tin(II) quasi-core–shell structure by depositing a SnCl2 layer (i.e. in diethyl ether solution) on the FA0.5MA0.5Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 surface during the antisolvent dripping process. The addition of SnCl2 (i) passivated the trap states at the grain boundaries, (ii) suppressed non-radiative recombination with a longer carrier lifetime in the resultant film, (iii) reduced the energy offset between the CBM of the perovskite and the LUMO of the C60 ETL, thereby improving electron extraction minimizing electron–hole bimolecular recombination at the perovskite/C60 interface and (iv) suppressed the formation of Sn2+ vacancies in the perovskite film with a low background carrier density. As a result, the 0.06 mg mL−1 SnCl2-treated device achieved the best PCE of 19.03%. More importantly, the SnCl2 passivation layer also improved the environmental and light stability of the device, which could be attributed to the fact that excess Sn2+ at the grain boundaries hindered that penetration of oxygen moisture and ion migration to the perovskite film.
Jayawardena et al.16 reported that 5 mg mL−1 GABr at the Cs0.05FA0.79MA0.16Pb0.5Sn0.5I3/PCBM interface, followed by thermal treatment of the resultant film, could form a more favourable band alignment at both anode and cathode interfaces, resulting in fast electron/hole extraction through the incorporation of Br− in the perovskite lattice (i.e. Cs0.05FA0.79MA0.16Pb0.5Sn0.5I3−xBrx). As a result, the device achieved the best PCE of 14.4%, with its FF approaching 83%.
Meanwhile, ammonium thiocyanate (NH4SCN) has also been used as a surface modifier at the FA0.66MA0.34Pb0.5Sn0.5I3/C60 interface.89 Even though NH4SCN has no effects on the perovskite film morphology and crystallinity, it enhanced electron extraction/electron collection at the perovskite/ETL interface and subsequently reduced non-radiative recombination in the device. As such, the PCE increased to 15.9% from 14.1% for the device obtained using 1 mg mL−1 NH4SCN in iso-propanol solution. No obvious loss in PCE was observed for the champion device after being exposed to ambient air with a humidity of 20–30% at 25 °C for 7 days.


7.3.4 ETL/electrode interface. 
Liu et al.240 introduced ZnO at the PCBM/Ag cathode interface to prevent Ag from penetrating into the perovskite film. As shown in Fig. 32, with ZnO at the PBCM/Ag interface, the Ag intensity in the perovskite layer was reduced and concentrated in the Ag electrode area. Without ZnO, Ag concentrated at both the perovskite layer and Ag electrode area. Due to a low Ag concentration in the perovskite layer for the PCBM/ZnO device, the device exhibited a low trap density of 3.27 × 1016 cm−3, with the best PCE of 18.1%. Meanwhile, the PCBM/ZnO device also exhibited long term operational stability compared to the control device without ZnO, indicating that the diffused Ag into the perovskite layer could affect the long term stability of the device.

7.4 Solvent engineering
The PbI2/(SnI2)·(DMSO)x complex slowed down the crystallization process of the mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ perovskite film.90,111 Recently, Zhu et al.241 investigated the MAPb0.75Sn0.25I3 film in a mixed solvent of DMSO:DMF by varying the DMSO concentration using a one-step method. In the absence of the DMSO solvent, there was a massive reaction between DMF-capped clusters, which divided the large cluster into small pieces, resulting in small perovskite grains, poor crystallinity, random orientation and high surface roughness. With DMSO, the surface clusters were capped by DMSO, which could be attributed to its higher affinity towards metal iodide than that of DMF, resulting in larger perovskite grain sizes, higher crystallinity, preferred orientation and low surface roughness of the film. However, at higher DMSO concentrations, it dissolved the colloidal clusters of metal halides more readily into smaller grains (Fig. 33a–e). Additionally, DMSO also prevented the colloidal coagulation observed in prolonged-storage precursors and ameliorated inhomogeneous mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ distributions in the resultant film. In this work, a PCE of 15.21% was achieved for the optimized device obtained at an optimum mixed volume ratio of DMSO:DMF = 50%:50%.

Meanwhile, the acetonitrile (CH3CN)/methylamine (CH3NH2) (ACN/MA) based solvent system has also been proposed to process mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ perovskite films.242 In contrast to conventional solvents (i.e. DMSO and/or DMF), the proposed solvent system was more volatile than DMF, enabling a fast drying process. Furthermore, MA could act as a reducing agent to replace the SnF2 additive to achieve the desired efficiency. A PCE of 11.1% was achieved for the optimized device.
Compared to anisole and CBZ, Bandara et al.243 reported that TL could remove unwanted Sn4+ in the mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ film during the antisolvent dripping process and formed larger grains with high crystallinity and improved carrier mobility. After careful optimization, the device achieved a champion PCE of 12.04% with negligible hysteresis.
7.5 Treatment engineering
Zhu et al.244 reported that the MAPb0.9Sn0.1I3 film prepared using thermal plus DMSO vapour assisted thermal annealing (TPDVATA) exhibited larger grains and a smooth surface when compared to the control film without DMSO vapour treatment. As such, the device achieved the best PCE (average PCE) of 10.25% (9.95 ± 0.51)%, whereas the control device without DMSO vapour treatment exhibited a poor PCE of 6.57%.
Li et al.245 synthesized MAPb0.75Sn0.25I3 film using sec-butyl alcohol plus DMF solvent annealing under N2 atmosphere (Fig. 34a). As shown in Fig. 34b and c, both mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ films without sec-butyl alcohol treatment and fabricated in ambient air exhibited poor morphology. After treatment, MAPb0.75Sn0.25I3 film exhibited dense and uniform distribution of large perovskite crystal grains (Fig. 34d), which could be attributed to sec-butyl alcohol solvent modulated kinetic growth of mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ perovskite film; whereas DMF solvent annealing under N2 atmosphere was important for facilitating perovskite crystal growth. In this work, PCE of 12.08% was achieved for the optimized device, as well as maintained 73% of initial PCE after being exposed to ambient air for 15 hours.

Zhao et al.246 demonstrated that the novel elevated temperature processing (NETP) method (i.e. the perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated on a pre-heated CTL-coated ITO substrate at 240 °C, followed by annealing at 100 °C) not only induced larger mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ perovskite grains with good surface coverage, but also induced a low energetic and structural disorder, resulting in a high PCE up to 10.0% based on MAPb0.4Sn0.6I3 as the absorber layer.
Meanwhile, MACl vapour has also been used to meditate the FA0.75Cs0.25Sn0.5Pb0.5I3 film.247 It increased the perovskite grain size and healed cracks that formed between grains during crystallization of the perovskite film, thereby suppressing non-radiative recombination at the interface. After optimization (i.e. MACl vapour treatment plus formic acid additive in the perovskite precursor solution), the device performance has reached 15.6%. Meanwhile, the encapsulation of the treated device also exhibited no PCE loss after continuous one sun illumination in a N2-filled glove box for 30 hours in the maximum power point tracking mode.
Liu et al.248 reported that the MAPb0.5Sn0.5IxCl3−x film derived under vacuum conditions (VC) exhibited a homogeneous coverage film with higher crystallinity when compared to the control film derived in a N2-atmosphere (Fig. 35a–g). In addition, the mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ perovskite film derived in vacuum conditions also exhibited a lower trap density and a lower energetic disorder. Thus, the device derived using the VC method achieved the best PCE of 12.3% and demonstrated higher environmental stability. It maintained >70% of the initial PCE after being stored in a N2-filled glove box for over 3 weeks.

Jiang et al.249 demonstrated that the delay annealing (DA) treatment method (i.e. the mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ film was stored for certain periods prior to the annealing process) could reduce the surface roughness of the mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ film and increase the interfacial contact between the perovskite and CTLs. As such, it increased the charge extraction rate and reduced carrier recombination at the perovskite/CTL interface. Consequently, the (FASnI3)0.6(MAPbI3)0.4 device obtained using the DA method achieved the best PCE of 18.86% and maintained over 92% of the initial PCE after being stored in a N2-filled glove box for 30 days.
7.6 Perovskite dimensionality manipulation

7.6.1 2D/3D PEA based mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ halide perovskites. 
PEABr was used as the capping layer to passivate the surface defects in the (FASnI3)0.25(MAPbI3)0.75 bulk film.107 Because PEABr induced vertically aligned perovskite crystals, it then improved the carrier transport to the respective CTLs with minimal recombination at grain boundaries. As a result, the carrier recombination lifetime of the PEABr-treated device was prolonged to 140 μs, which was more than 2-fold higher than that of the control device without PEABr treatment. After optimization, a PCE of 15.15% was achieved for the device obtained using 1 mg mL−1 PEABr, which exhibited excellent environmental stability compared to the control device. Without encapsulation, the PEABr-treated device maintained >80% (>50%) of the initial PCE after being stored in a N2-filled glove box (ambient air with a 50 ± 10% relative humidity) for 432 hours.
Meanwhile, PEAI has also been introduced on the mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ film to form a 2D/3D heterojunction perovskite structure to serve as a protective layer.250 It was found that PEAI not only suppressed the oxidation of Sn2+, but also passivated the surface and grain boundary trap states. Thus, PEAI reduced surface recombination and promoted charge transport in the device, which led to a higher PCE of 15.5% at an optimum concentration of 1 mg mL−1 of PEAI. Under continuous one sun illumination in a N2-filled glove box, the PEAI-treated device without encapsulation preserved 60% of the initial PCE for 400 hours. During the air stability measurement, it maintained 60% of the initial PCE after being exposed to ambient air with a (30 ± 10)% relative humidity for 40 hours. On the other hand, Wei et al.251 reported that PEAI in isopropanol solution induced the surface degradation of the 2D/3D mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ film. By replacing iso-propanol with the ethyl acetate (EA) solvent, they achieved a higher PCE of 19.4% with a certified PCE of 18.95%. A negligible degradation in PCE was observed for the optimized device after being stored in a N2-filled glove box for 1 month.
Li et al.108 fabricated a vertically aligned 2D/3D heterostructure by adding 3.75% 2-(4-fluorophenyl)ethylammonium iodide (FPEAI) in the (MAPbI3)0.75(FASnI3)0.25 perovskite film. FPEAI not only suppressed phase segregation in the perovskite film, but also increased the charge extraction rate and reduced charge recombination in the device. Consequently, the PCE has reached 17.51% from 12.51%, and the device exhibited greater stability compared to the control device. Without encapsulation, the FPEAI-treated device maintained 90% (70%) of its initial PCE after being stored in a N2-filled glove box (ambient air with a 50–70% relative humidity) for 1200 hours (400 hours).


7.6.2 Other 2D/3D mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ halide perovskites. 
Chen et al.252 fabricated a coherent 2D/3D mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ halide perovskite by adding N-(3-aminopropyl)-2-pyrrolidinone (NAP) in the MAPb0.5Sn0.5IxCl3−x film. NAP significantly changed the perovskite film morphology (Fig. 36a). With the addition of 9 mM NAP in the mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ film, the PCE was improved from 10.3% to 13.4%, which could be attributed to the fact that the resulting smooth film with a lower number of pinholes enhanced (suppressed) carrier extraction (carrier recombination) in the device. At a higher concentration of NAP, poor perovskite film morphology was formed and the device performance deteriorated. However, it improved the environmental and light stability of the devices (Fig. 36b), which could be attributed to the fact that the hydrophobic behaviour of NAP could serve as a physical barrier to prevent air moisture from penetrating into the 2D/3D perovskite film.

On the other hand, Tong et al.253 reported that 2D GuaSCN passivated grain boundaries and suppressed Sn2+ vacancies more readily in the 3D (FASnI3)0.6(MAPbI3)0.4 film from 2.8 × 1017 cm−3 to 1.7 × 1016 cm−3, which led to a longer carrier lifetime of 1.2 μs and a longer diffusion length of 2.5 μm. Additionally, GuaSCN also improved the resultant film morphology (i.e. more compact film with a lower number of pinholes). Benefitting from these, the PCE was improved from 15.3% for the 3D device to 18.4% for the 2D/3D one, with the best PCE of 20.5%. More interestingly, under one sun illumination in the maximum power point tracking mode, the encapsulated 2D/3D device showed slight deterioration after ≈115 hours.
Ke et al.254 reported that 3-(aminomethyl) piperidinium (3AMP) in the MA0.5FA0.5Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 film formed a good energy band alignment in the device and removed unwanted Sn2+ vacancies in the resultant 2D/3D film. As a result, the resultant 2D/3D film exhibited a longer carrier lifetime of 671.6 ns, whereas the control 3D film exhibited a shorter carrier lifetime of 204.6 ns. A PCE of 20.09% was achieved for the optimized device obtained using 2.5 mol% 3AMP, which exhibited higher light stability compared to the control 3D device. After encapsulation, the 2D/3D device (3D device) maintained 73.2% (8.8%) of the initial PCE after light soaking in ambient air with a 20–50% relative humidity at room temperature for 100 hours, which could be attributed to the fact that the organic 3AMP spacing layer could prevent the penetration of air-moisture, retarded the oxidation of Sn2+ in the perovskite framework and passivated the perovskite surface.

8. Conclusion and future outlooks
We have systematically reviewed the challenging issues of Sn2+ based halide perovskites and methodologies to enhance the device performance/stability. It should be noted that Sn2+ based halide perovskites are suitable to act as light-harvesting materials for efficient PSCs in the future not only due to their excellent opto-electrical properties, but also because theoretically they can deliver a high PCE approaching the S–Q limit (see Fig. 9c). At the present research stage, the best PCE of >10% (>20%) has been achieved for inverted structure Sn2+ (mixed Pb2+/Sn2+) PSCs. However, the reported PCE is still far behind the theoretical value. In addition, Sn2+ based halide perovskite materials experience three critical problems, namely (i) rapid oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+, wherein the chemical instability of Sn2+ leads to self-doping and/or an enormous increase in the hole concentration of the perovskite film; (ii) uncontrollable perovskite film crystallization from the precursor solution resulting in poor film morphology (i.e. pinholes with poor surface coverage) and (iii) a large energy offset between the perovskite and CTLs resulting in severe charge carrier recombination at the perovskite/CTL interface in the device (see Fig. 9d).
Although great efforts or progress has been made, we believe that additive engineering, interface engineering, solvent engineering and perovskite dimensionality manipulation are critical to produce highly efficient and stable Sn2+ based halide PSCs. For example, additive engineering in Sn2+ based halide perovskites can (i) suppress the oxidation of Sn2+ and/or background carrier density in the perovskite film, (ii) optimize the energy level between the perovskite and CTLs, resulting in better carrier extraction and injection, and (iii) improve the perovskite film morphology by controlling its crystallization. In addition, the interface engineering of Sn2+ based halide perovskite films can minimize the energy barrier at the perovskite/CTL interface to improve the carrier extraction from the perovskite to CTLs with a low carrier recombination rate. Through solvent engineering in a Sn2+ based halide perovskite precursor solution, crystallization can be controlled and the perovskite film morphology can be improved during the film deposition process. Furthermore, perovskite dimensionality manipulation from 3D to 2D or from 3D to 2D/3D can improve the device stability, regardless of air-stability, thermal stability or light stability. In contrast, composition engineering (i.e. mixed organic–inorganic cations or mixed halide anions) and treatment engineering can be considered as options to further improve the opto-electrical properties of Sn2+ based halide perovskite films.
To promote the development of highly efficient and stable Sn2+ and mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ PSCs in the future, we provide several suggestions:
(i) The state-of-the-art Sn2+ and mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ halide perovskites are mostly at the stage of materials development. Therefore, research collaborations across multidisciplinary research fields are required to understand their physical/chemical properties and improve the device performance/stability.
(ii) Theoretical and modelling strategies are needed for better understanding the advanced Sn2+ and mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ perovskite materials design.
(iii) High purity tin halide materials should be used to fabricate Sn2+ or mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ films to prevent quick oxidation of the perovskite film.
(iv) Because Sn2+ is unstable and easily oxidizes in ambient conditions, it is important to eliminate the presence of oxygen during the fabrication of Sn2+ and mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ films and/or devices. The whole fabrication process must be carried out in an inert and/or reducing atmosphere. In addition, development of advanced encapsulation techniques is needed to stabilize Sn2+ or mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ PSCs in ambient conditions. Proper encapsulation can prolong the device performance and its lifetime.
(v) To reduce carrier recombination and optimize Voc in the device, researchers can explore inorganic materials as CTLs to replace the commonly used organic CTLs (i.e. spiro-OMeTAD, PEDOT:PSS, fullerene and its derivatives, etc.), which are unstable and easily degrade in ambient conditions. It should be noted that these inorganic CTLs must be compact films and have a good energy band alignment with Sn2+ or mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ (i.e. HTL with a shallower VBM and ETL with a shallower CBM). Graphene based materials and transition metal dichalcogenides can be possibly applied to Sn2+ or mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ PSCs as 2D CTLs. We believe that these inorganic CTLs can isolate oxygen and air moisture from surrounding, thereby inhibiting the oxidation of Sn2+ and improving the device stability.
(vi) Combination of co-additive, co-cation and/or co-anion in a 2D/3D structure should be considered in Sn2+ or mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ to further improve the film stability and the device performance.
(vii) Multi-junction solar cells (i.e. perovskite tandem cells) should be fabricated by mechanically stacking two individual subcells, which are promising to obtain a PCE beyond the S–Q limit. The ideal Eg values of tandem solar cells are in the ranges of 0.9 to 1.2 eV for the rear cell and 1.7 to 1.9 eV for the front cell. The rear cell is based on low Eg mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ PSCs. By optimizing the deposition process as discussed above, we strongly believe that it can provide high device performance with superior stability.
In conclusion, we believe that Sn2+ and mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ PSCs are the major trends in the future. Even though at present Sn2+ and mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ halide perovskites are less popular compared to Pb2+ based halide perovskites, we should treat them with a positive attitude because Sn2+ based halide PSCs have developed well in just a few years (i.e. in 2014 for MASnI3 and MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 PSCs). Once Sn2+ or mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ perovskites have proved to be useful in photovoltaic technologies, it can be realized and commercialized in the market.

Broader context
Solar energy has the potential to fix the fast-rising energy demand problem because it is free and abundant. New novel solar harvesting materials for the next generation photovoltaic technology such as thin film photovoltaic, dye-sensitized photovoltaic, quantum-dot photovoltaic, organic photovoltaic and perovskite photovoltaic technologies have been widely investigated from around the world. Among them, perovskite photovoltaic technology has attracted tremendous attention owing to the rapid development in both efficiency and stability achieved in recent years. However, the lead (Pb2+) halide perovskite absorber layer is not only toxic, but also exhibits a larger energy bandgap. Because tin (Sn2+) can fully or partially substitute in the Pb2+ halide perovskite structure with negligible perovskite lattice perturbations, a Pb2+-free or low Pb2+ halide perovskite absorber layer with a narrower energy band gap that is close to the optimal range in the Shockley–Queisser maximum efficiency limit can be achieved. Herein, the challenging issues of Sn2+ based halide perovskites and the device engineering of Sn2+ and mixed Pb2+/Sn2+ halide perovskites are reviewed and summarized. Finally, future prospects and remaining challenges are presented to help further progression of efficient Sn2+-based photovoltaic technology.
