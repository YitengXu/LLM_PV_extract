    , Accepted 20th April 2020First published on 21st April 2020AbstractWith the ever-increasing demand for energy globally, artificial photosynthesis through photoelectrochemical water splitting has attracted attention as a promising approach to realize sustainable and environmentally friendly energy resources. Because of the excellent efficiency improvement of photovoltaics, considerable research has focused on the development of Cu(In1−xGax)Se2 (CIGS)-based photocathodes for efficient hydrogen evolution. To optimize devices and materials for photocathodes, it is imperative to understand the physics behind the generation, separation, and transport of charge carriers. Here, CdS/CIGS-based photocathodes are modeled using optical and electrical simulations to study such effects and unravel various performance-limiting parameters. The model is well calibrated with experimental results. Specifically, we show that (a) the solar-to-hydrogen conversion or ideal regenerative cell efficiency is strongly governed by the defects at the CdS/CIGS interface, mole fraction x (=[Ga]/([Ga] + [In])), bulk defects in CIGS, and surface reaction rate of electrons with protons, (b) the onset potential saturation with increasing mole fraction is caused by defect states at the CdS/CIGS interface, (c) the optimized mole fraction for maximum efficiency is higher than the corresponding one for solar cells. These results represent an important step towards building a theoretical platform for the development of p–n heterojunction photocatalytic devices.
Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is potentially a viable method to convert solar energy into clean, green, and sustainable chemical fuel energy.1–6 Since the discovery of solar water splitting by Honda and Fujishima in 1972 using TiO2, researchers around the world have spent much effort designing and developing novel materials to meet the challenging solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of 10% needed for market commercialization.7 To achieve practical efficiency requirements, the essential prerequisites of photoresponsive materials are appropriate energy band alignment with the water redox potential, visible light absorption, free charge carrier generation and separation, long diffusion length, and long-term chemical stability.8,9 Various device structures such as thin films,10–12 tandem,13 particulate or powder system,14–16 nanorods,17–19 and Z-scheme20,21 have been used to enhance activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In particular, thin films of n-type photoanodes (PAs) generate minority holes under solar illumination for the OER, whereas p-type photocathodes (PCs) produce minority electrons under light for the HER. The efficiency of overall water splitting for tandem schemes with both a PA and PC depends on the match of the current density at the overlap potential, which is generally limited by onset potential (Vonset), fill factor (FF), and current density.13,22 Therefore, it is imperative to understand the carrier transport physics of these electrodes to identify their performance-limiting parameters.
In recent years, using modelling and simulations, PEC solar water splitting systems was extensively studied to identify performance limiting device and material parameters which were not accessible by experimental measurements. Berger et al. proposed an integrated 1-dimensional model of PEC cell connecting homogenous thin film light absorbing semiconductor model (for charge carrier transport) with the electrolyte model (mass transport of reactants and products) by a kinetic model at the interface.23 The simulation results obtained from this model were in good agreement with the current–voltage (IV) characteristics of Si/Pt based photocathode. In another work, Cendula et al. presented a physical model calculating an energy band diagram of a semiconductor electrode and the IV characteristics of PEC cell.24 This model was validated with the experimental data of well explored n-type hematite and p-type cuprous oxide. Besides this, Mills et al. highlighted 1-D numerical model to describe the charge transfer process across semiconductor–catalyst interface to provide insight behind the IV characteristics of semiconductor-catalyst-solution systems.25 Gaudy et al. demonstrated a numerical model which predicted the IV characteristics of oxide and oxynitride particle based photoelectrodes and subsequently provided material design guideline and key parameters to achieve high performance LaTiO2N particle based photoelectrode.26 Recently, the authors of our group Pihosh et al. introduced a 3-D model to quantify optical and recombination loss mechanism in high performance Ta3N5-nanorods based photoanodes.27 The validation of above-mentioned reported models is strictly based on the knowledge of material parameters.
p-type doped Cu(In1−xGax)Se2 (CIGS), which has a tunable band gap28 and high absorption coefficient (105 cm−1)29 has attracted much research interest in the photocatalysis community. Among various buffer layers, CdS is widely used to facilitate the extraction of photogenerated electrons and suppress hole transport because of the large valence band offset at the CdS/CIGS interface.30 Based on theoretical and experimental studies, various groups previously investigated the impact of grain boundaries,31,32 band gap grading in CIGS,33–35 and conduction band offset at buffer layer/CIGS interface on the performance of CIGS based solar cells but not on the performance of PCs.36,37 Our group previously demonstrated a heterojunction of p-type CIGS with an n-type CdS layer with enhanced photocurrent and relatively high Vonset by optimizing Ga content (mole fraction, x).38 Moreover, our experimental results suggested that the performance or STH efficiency of the heterojunctions was limited by both FF and the Vonset saturation at high x (>0.5). However, the physical origin of such saturation of Vonset is still unknown and not very well described in the literature.
In this work, we perform optical and electrical simulations to identify performance limiting parameters of CdS/CIGS-based PCs. We find that parameter metrics such as the current density at 0 VRHE (Jsc), FF, Vonset, and maximum half-cell solar-to-hydrogen (HC-STH) or ideal regenerative cell efficiency (ηmax) strongly depend on the defect state density in CIGS bulk and at the CdS/CIGS interface, x, surface reaction rate for the HER/electron recombination velocity, parasitic series, and parallel resistance. The experimentally observed Vonset saturation at high x is caused by the presence of interface defect states. Our numerical simulation results match well with experimental data. Below, we first describe the model system and then present a detailed analysis of the effect of defect states and electron extraction rate on the performance of CIGS-based PCs.
Model system

Fig. 1a illustrates a schematic of the model CIGS-based PC. In this device, the visible light energy-harvesting CIGS material with a thickness LCIGS of 1.8 μm was sandwiched between a molybdenum (Mo) back contact and CdS layer. The front buffer layer CdS was interfaced to a pseudo-metal contact whose work function was calibrated to the reduction potential of protons (H+) at a pH of 6.8 for the HER according to the Nernst equation. Interfacial properties such as the electron and hole transition across the junction of CdS and pseudo-metal contact was defined by the electron Sn and hole surface recombination velocity Sp, respectively. We consider Sp = 0 and non-zero Sn for selective transport of electrons from CdS to pseudo-metal contact for hydrogen evolution reaction. We assumed an ohmic contact between the Mo back contact and p-type CIGS layer. Under equilibrium conditions, as shown in Fig. 1b, the Fermi level of p-type CIGS and n-type CdS was equilibrated to form a depletion region near CdS/CIGS interface, which is essential for the separation of photogenerated charge carriers. Fig. 1c shows conduction and valence band energy levels for CIGS with different x, determined from the linear fit to the extracted experimental data.38 Here, mole fraction x is defined as the ratio of Ga content to the sum of Ga and In content i.e. x = [Ga]/([Ga] + [In]). Recombination of charge carriers was predominantly governed by the bulk mid-gap defect state density NB such that the calculated carrier lifetime τ = 1/NBvthc was in the microsecond range. Here, vth is the thermal velocity and c is the capture cross-section area for electrons or holes. The contributions of radiative and Auger recombination were negligible for the studied doping density in the CIGS layer. In addition, we incorporated an additional recombination loss pathway through uniformly distributed (in the CIGS energy band gap) defect states present at the CdS/CIGS interface. For a particular x, the interface defect state density NI was varied to evaluate its effects on the performance metrics of CIGS-based PCs. We assumed uniform doping density and x across the thickness of the CIGS layer in our simulations, which may be contradictory to the situation in real devices. Uncertainty of the grading profile in the CIGS layer in the region around 0.2 μm from the CIGS surface or CIGS/Mo interface made it difficult to conduct realistic simulations. For simplicity, we postulated that the effect of interfaces on performance does not depend on the type of grading profile in the CIGS layer but is instead controlled by defect density and conduction band offset at the CdS/CIGS interface. Numerical values of various material parameters of respective layers used in the electrical simulations are provided in Table S1.† For better readership, a list of symbols (with description) which are employed throughout the manuscript is provided in Table 1.

Complex refractive indices or optical constants such as refractive index n and extinction coefficient k of individual layers in the device structure are needed to perform optical simulations. Therefore, we estimated the complex refractive index from ellipsometry measurements of CIGS and CdS layers39 (see Fig. S1a and b†). We assumed that the effect of Mo and electrolyte on the device optical characteristics was negligible in the visible wavelength region. The quantum mechanical formulation of Forouhi and Bloomer (FB) was used to parameterize complex refractive indices with x (details are provided in the ESI†).40Fig. 1d compares the charge carrier generation rate G calculated from experimental data and the FB fit of optical constants for the system with x = 0.23 simulated using the AFORS HET simulator tool.41 It is evident that the mismatch of low n in Fig. S1b† is not translated to G in Fig. 1d. Furthermore, the corresponding current density J was calculated by integrating simulated G across device thickness; i.e., . Here, q is the electronic charge and z is the position coordinate in the current flow direction. Fig. 1e shows that J decreases with x because less solar spectrum is harvested by the CIGS layer as a result of the obvious increase of band-gap energy at high x, as shown in Fig. 1c. In addition, we found that similar J were obtained from experimental data and the FB fit of optical constants. Because the reported optical constants of CIGS with various x are limited, the simulated G corresponding to the FB fit was used in electrical simulations of CdS/CIGS PCs. Electrical simulations were performed using SCAPS, which provided a self-consistent solution of drift diffusion, continuity, and Poisson's equation at each voltage bias.42 Using our model calibrated with experimental data, we were able to explore the effects of defect state density NI at the CdS/CIGS interface, x, and surface reaction rate or electron surface recombination velocity Sn on the performance of CdS/CIGS PCs.
Results & discussion
(i) Effect of interface defect states on PC performance
The total interface defect state density NI at the junction of CIGS and CdS materials was logarithmically varied between 103 and 109 cm−2 to explore its effect on the performance of CIGS PCs. In addition, the band gap and conduction band offset at the CdS/CIGS interface were tuned with the change of x from 0 to 1. Here, x = 0 corresponds to CuInSe2 (CIS), which has a narrow band gap and x = 1 represents CuGaSe2 (CGS), which has a wide band gap. We fixed the mid-gap bulk defect state density of CIGS at NB = 1014 cm−3 and the electron extraction/transition rate from CdS to the electrolyte Sn at 0.01 cm s−1. In the literature,43 HC-STH efficiency η is defined as the ratio of the product of potential gain with photocurrent density (Jph) to the power received Pin (100 mW cm−2) from the AM 1.5 G solar spectrum at 1-sun light intensity and is given by (1)
Here, ERHE is the applied potential and EH+/H2 is the equilibrium potential for hydrogen evolution reaction for the PCs. With ideal non-polarizable dark electrode (where, EH+/H2 = 0 VRHE), HC-STH efficiency is equivalent to the recently reported ratiometric power saved.44 At the maximum power point, Jph = Jmax and ERHE = Vmax to obtain ideal regenerative cell efficiency ηmax = JmaxVmax/Pin, which is similar to photovoltaic devices. We also defined FF as the ratio of maximum power Pmax (=JmaxVmax) observed to the product of Vonset and Jsc. Accordingly, efficiency ηmax is given by (2)

Fig. 2 shows the influence of interface defect density NI on the performance metrics of CdS/CIGS PCs. Here, the y- and x-axes represent NI and x, respectively. The results in Fig. 2a indicate that, for low NI (<107 cm−2), Vonset increases linearly with x. Such a rise of Vonset is driven by the increase in the band gap of CIGS with x. However, such an effect of band gap increase at high x was compensated by the charge carrier recombination at the CdS/CIGS interface. As a result, at high NI(>107 cm−2), Vonset increases and becomes saturated with increasing x. In contrast, Fig. 2b reveals that Jsc was not affected by NI at any x (0 < x < 1). This is because the photogenerated charge carriers were separated at the CdS/CIGS interface by the built-in electric field and thus minimized the additional charge carrier recombination via interface defect states. At a particular NI, Jsc decreased with increasing x because the band gap widening led to less optical absorption of the solar spectrum. Previously, a spike-shaped barrier originating from the mismatch of the conduction band minima of CIGS and CdS has been correlated with the decreased photocurrent of the system with x = 0.5 compared to that of the system with x = 0.3. By using an optical simulation in addition to electrical simulations, we directly revealed the correlation between the photocurrent and band mismatch variation with x.38 We found that Vonset rather than the photocurrent was influenced by the band mismatch variation with x at high NI(>107 cm−2).
 Fig. 2  Effect of interface defect state density NI on performance metrics of CdS/CIGS photocathodes. Variation of (a) onset potential Vonset, (b) current density Jsc, (c) fill factor FF, and (d) efficiency ηmax with NI and mole fraction x. For x < 0.5, the effect of NI on the performance metrics is negligible. Apart from Jsc, for x > 0.5, high NI markedly decreased Vonset, FF, and ηmax. The results indicate that (a) the defect states induce Vonset saturation for higher x (>0.5) and (b) the optimum x for maximum FF and ηmax depends on NI. 

Fig. 2c shows the effects of NI and x on FF. Interestingly, for a given NI, FF increased and then decreased with rising x. As a result, maximum FF was observed at a particular x (xFF). Furthermore, the optimized xFF depended on NI. For instance, xFF was close to 0.4 at high NI = 109 cm−2, whereas it was in the vicinity of 0.8 at low NI = 103 cm−2. Fig. 2d displays the efficiency at different NI and x. The results suggest that the ηmax trend dictated by FF as Vonset increase is compensated by decrease of Jsc with rising x. Therefore, we obtain similar variations of FF and ηmax as functions of NI and x. Fig. 2d indicates that ηmax can be optimized by varying x; however, the optimized mole fraction xη depends on the quality of the CdS/CIGS interface. We observe that xη lies in the range of 0.4–0.5 at high NI, whereas the devices with a high-quality interface or low NI show optimized ηmax at x in the window of 0.62–0.8. Our results clearly highlight the critical role of interface defect states in the performance optimization of CdS/CIGS PCs.
To compare our simulations with reported baseline experimental results,38 we extracted experimental data for the relationship between Vonset and x for CdS/CIGS-based PCs under simulated AM1.5G light in 0.5 M Na2SO4 + 0.25 M Na2HPO4 + 0.25 M NaH2PO4 (aq.) electrolyte adjusted to pH 6.8. The PC surface was modified with Pt (Pt/CdS/CIGS/Mo). Fig. 3a compares the simulated and experimental variation of Vonset with x. In the simulations, we varied the bulk defect density NB (=1013 and 1014 cm−3) at high NI = 109 cm−2 and different x. The simulated and experimental results showed excellent agreement. This suggests that the charge carrier recombination induced by the interface defect density saturated Vonset at high x. However, at low x (<0.5), the linear region of Vonset with x was governed by NB in addition to the band-gap variation with x. Furthermore, we deduced that the quality of the CIGS film in terms of NB was good for low x, whereas the CIGS film with high x also had high NB. These findings were further supported by scanning electron microscopy images from the literature, which suggested that the CIGS crystallinity degraded with increasing x, which would increase NB of the CIGS material.38 In a tandem-type photoelectrode for water splitting, a higher photocurrent Vonset is preferable. Our findings suggest that the performance of the current CIGS films was limited by both interface and bulk defects and indicates the necessity of defect engineering to further improve Vonset of such devices.
 Fig. 3  Comparison of simulated (lines) and experimental (symbols) data38 for CdS/CIGS photocathodes with different mole fraction x. Effect of x on (a) onset potential Vonset and (b) current–potential characteristics. The reasonable match of simulated trends with experimental data suggests that the correlation of Vonset with x is caused by the high NI(=109 cm−2) present at the interface of CIGS and CdS. 
Next, we examine the current–voltage characteristics of the CdS/CIGS PCs with different x, and calibrate the modeled devices in the operating voltage range of 0 < V < Vonset. To do this, we extracted the reported baseline data for CdS/CIGS PCs with x = 0, 0.5, 0.7, and 1. Fig. 3b presents the current–voltage characteristics of the PCs with different x. From Fig. S2 of ESI,† the current potential characteristics reveals that there is a considerable mismatch between the FF and Jsc obtained from simulations and baseline experiments, which suggests that a simple device model is insufficient to analyze the performance of CdS/CIGS PCs. For instance, FF and Jsc at high NI in Fig. 2 are higher than those in Fig. 3b at the same x. Therefore, we incorporated additional parameters such as attenuation constant Ac, series resistance Rs, and shunt resistance Rsh into the modeled device in Fig. 1. Ac was used to scale down G across the device (obtained from parameterization of optical constants) such that the resultant Jsc was calibrated to the baseline experiment data. Furthermore, Rs and Rsh were included to modulate Jsc in the high voltage region (near Vonset) and low voltage region (around short-circuit conditions; 0 VRHE), respectively, which allowed FF calibration. With such parameters (Ac, Rs, and Rsh), as shown in Fig. 3b, the current–voltage characteristics obtained from the numerical simulations showed excellent agreement with the reported baseline data for CdS/CIGS PCs with various x.
As previously shown in Fig. 3b, the results indicated that x = 0.5 provided more promising current–voltage characteristics than x = 0, 0.7, and 1. Specifically, when x = 0.5, Jsc exceeded 25 mA cm−2 and Vonset approached 0.7 VRHE. Further, the series resistance Rs = 12 Ω cm2 which was higher than the series resistance value at x = 0 but lower in comparison to the values at x = 0.7 and 1, whereas, the shunt resistance Rsh (=55 Ω cm2) was much lower as compared to the shunt resistance values for x = 0.7 and 1 but higher than that for x = 0. In the photovoltaics community, it is well known that low Rs and high Rsh are needed to increase FF.45 We noticed that the difference between a CdS/CIGS-based solar cell with high FF and our PCs was the absence of a highly conducting ZnO window layer and metal contact. In the PCs, the CdS layer was interfaced with the electrolyte with limited electrical conductivity and buffering ability. Although Rs and Rsh could be modulated by varying x of CdS/CIGS PCs, the electrical conductivity and buffering ability of the electrolyte might also influence these parameters. Although Rs and Rsh were introduced phenomenologically, the bulk carrier lifetime τB along with defect density NB in the CIGS layer, NI, and Ac were able to be estimated from the fit to the baseline experimental data. Further details of such performance-limiting parameters at various x are provided in Table S3.†
(ii) Influence of electron extraction rate on PC performance
Several types of materials used in well-established solar cell technologies have shown potential for hydrogen generation by water splitting; e.g., silicon,46–48 CIGS,38,49,50 and perovskites.5,51,52 However, despite the similar operating principle of the device structure, the STH performance of such photocatalytic devices is much lower than that of equivalent solar cells. This performance loss could originate from the different interfacial properties of the top metal contact in solar cells and electrolyte in photocatalytic devices. For instance, in CdS/CIGS systems, the electron extraction rate from the front window CdS layer can vary substantially between solar cells and PCs and thus affect device performance. Therefore, it is essential to explore the effects of electron extraction rate on the performance of CIGS-based PCs. To do this, the electron extraction rate was varied by tuning Sn for various x. We considered optimized (i.e., low NI = 103 cm−2) CdS/CIGS interfaces with NB = 1014 cm−3 to investigate the variation of performance with Sn.

Fig. 4 shows the effect of Sn on the performance parameters of CdS/CIGS PCs. Here, x- and y-axes represent the variation of mole fraction x and Sn, respectively. We find that Vonset increased with Sn and became saturated above a certain value of Sn at various x (Fig. 4a). In contrast, as illustrated in Fig. 4b, Jsc was not affected by Sn and was governed only by the optical properties of various device layers. At a fixed x, FF showed similar characteristics (with Sn) as compared to Vonset (Fig. 4c). However, the onset of saturation of FF with Sn was higher than that for Vonset. Putting it all together, we found that the efficiency ηmax in Fig. 4d decreased with Sn and the onset of saturation of ηmax with Sn was dictated by FF. Our results indicated that the ηmax at the optimized x decreased with Sn. Interestingly, the optimized x, corresponding to the maximum of ηmax, increased from 0.55 to 0.7 as Sn was varied from 107 to 10−2 cm s−1; i.e., the optimized x increased with decreasing Sn.
 Fig. 4  Effect of electron surface recombination velocity Sn on the performance of CdS/CIGS devices. Effect of Sn on the (a) onset potential, (b) current density Jsc, (c) fill factor FF, and (d) efficiency ηmax of CdS/CIGS devices with different mole fraction x. Here, high Sn can be considered the regime of solar cells, whereas the PCs are in the region of low Sn. The points on the red arrow in (d) indicate the maximum values of ηmax at different Sn. The results indicate that Jsc is independent of Sn, whereas Vonset, FF, and ηmax decrease with Sn. The optimized x to achieve maximum ηmax depends on Sn. 
Now, we correlate the regimes of Sn with different device applications like solar cells and PCs. For solar cells, we believe that the top metal contact provides numerous empty/unfilled states, which would result in high Sn. Conversely, for PCs, the electron transition from the CdS layer is limited by the availability of protons and could lead to low Sn. Therefore, CdS/CIGS n–p heterojunction (as described previously in Model system) with high Sn = 107 cm s−1 is defined as a solar cell, whereas that with low Sn = 10−2 cm s−1 corresponds to a PC.

Fig. 5 shows the variation of ηmax with x for solar cells and PCs with different CIGS film quality or distinct NB. At a given film quality, CIGS-based solar cells and PCs ηmax increased and then decreased with rising x, which led to the maximum value of ηmax at a certain x. We found that the optimized x for solar cells and PCs were distinct and may depend on the film quality or NB. For a given film quality, the optimized x for PCs was always larger than that for solar cells. Obviously, ηmax of PCs was lower than that of corresponding solar cells. Such optimized ηmax for both device applications was further lowered by the increase of NB.

Effect of x on the efficiency ηmax of solar cells (black circles) and photocathodes (red triangles) at different bulk defect densities NB. ηmax of the photocathodes was lower than that of equivalent solar cells, which was caused by the lower electron transition rate from the CdS layer to the electrolyte in PCs than in solar cells. In addition, the optimized x to achieve maximum ηmax were different for solar cells and PCs, which may be related to the CIGS film quality or NB. 
Conclusions
We conducted optical and electrical simulations, to study various performance-limiting device and material parameters of CdS/CIGS-based PCs. Our results indicated that performance metrics such as current density at 0 VRHE, fill factor, onset potential, and efficiency were strongly affected by mole fraction x, interface defect density NI, bulk defect density NB or the quality of the CIGS thin film, and electron extraction rate Sn. In particular, we demonstrated that the onset potential saturation at high mole fraction was induced by interface defect density NI. The optimized mole fraction to achieve maximum efficiency was relatively larger for the PCs than the corresponding mole fraction for solar cell applications. The numerical simulation results agreed well with reported baseline experimental data, which enabled us to quantify various parameters affecting the current–potential characteristics of CdS/CIGS-based PCs. We believe that our results represent a theoretical platform that can be used to help realize highly efficient CIGS-based PCs for STH production from water splitting.

 	Fig. 2  Effect of interface defect state density NI on performance metrics of CdS/CIGS photocathodes. Variation of (a) onset potential Vonset, (b) current density Jsc, (c) fill factor FF, and (d) efficiency ηmax with NI and mole fraction x. For x < 0.5, the effect of NI on the performance metrics is negligible. Apart from Jsc, for x > 0.5, high NI markedly decreased Vonset, FF, and ηmax. The results indicate that (a) the defect states induce Vonset saturation for higher x (>0.5) and (b) the optimum x for maximum FF and ηmax depends on NI.	 

 	Fig. 3  Comparison of simulated (lines) and experimental (symbols) data38 for CdS/CIGS photocathodes with different mole fraction x. Effect of x on (a) onset potential Vonset and (b) current–potential characteristics. The reasonable match of simulated trends with experimental data suggests that the correlation of Vonset with x is caused by the high NI(=109 cm−2) present at the interface of CIGS and CdS.	 

 	Fig. 4  Effect of electron surface recombination velocity Sn on the performance of CdS/CIGS devices. Effect of Sn on the (a) onset potential, (b) current density Jsc, (c) fill factor FF, and (d) efficiency ηmax of CdS/CIGS devices with different mole fraction x. Here, high Sn can be considered the regime of solar cells, whereas the PCs are in the region of low Sn. The points on the red arrow in (d) indicate the maximum values of ηmax at different Sn. The results indicate that Jsc is independent of Sn, whereas Vonset, FF, and ηmax decrease with Sn. The optimized x to achieve maximum ηmax depends on Sn.	 

 	Fig. 5  Performance variation of CIGS-based solar cells (Sn = 107 cm s−1) and photocathodes (Sn = 10−2 cm s−1) with mole fraction x. Effect of x on the efficiency ηmax of solar cells (black circles) and photocathodes (red triangles) at different bulk defect densities NB. ηmax of the photocathodes was lower than that of equivalent solar cells, which was caused by the lower electron transition rate from the CdS layer to the electrolyte in PCs than in solar cells. In addition, the optimized x to achieve maximum ηmax were different for solar cells and PCs, which may be related to the CIGS film quality or NB.
