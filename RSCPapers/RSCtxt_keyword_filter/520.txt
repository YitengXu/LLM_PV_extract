Four different synthetic approaches have been reviewed: naturally favoured growth due to its intrinsically anisotropic crystal structure, modified anisotropic growth by changing surface energies or utilizing organic templates, oriented attachment of small nanocrystal building blocks to form nanowires or nanosheets, and chemical transformation from existing nanostructures into new species. We discuss current understanding of the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects associated with the mechanisms of forming these anisotropic MC nanostructures. We provide examples of representative applications of anisotropic chalcogenide nanomaterials that are expected to be practically meaningful in the near future. The applications include electrodes for lithium ion batteries, photodetectors, thermoelectric devices, and solar cells. A brief review of other potential applications (oxygen reduction reaction, localized surface plasmon resonance, topological insulator, superconductor) is provided as well. This review ends with discussions on the challenges to be investigated thoroughly in the solution-based synthesis of anisotropic nanomaterials, which includes surface energy control, correcting the nucleation & growth mechanism, removal of the organic surfactant, kinetic study on the chemical transformation, scale-up of production, and eco-friendly synthesis.Yuho MinYuho Min received a B.S. degree in the Dept. of Materials Science and Engineering from Yonsei University in 2010.

1. Introduction
Having the ability to exert control over the shape of nanocrystals has always been desired and essential to tune their chemical or physical properties for target applications.1–3 Anisotropic nanocrystals have unique properties that are direction-dependent and have the ability to confine the motion of electrons, holes, excitons, phonons, and plasmons in specific and controlled directions.1,3 Such uniqueness has been employed in electronics (conducting platforms, transistors, electromechanical devices),4–7 energy conversion and storage devices (Li ion batteries, solar cells, thermoelectrics, piezoelectrics),8–17 optical devices (lasers, OLEDs, photodetectors),18–21 and electrochemical devices (catalysis, gas sensors).22,23 Anisotropic nanocrystals have been observed in many materials including carbons, silicon, metals, metal oxides, chalcogenides, carbides, nitrides, and their compounds.24,25
Although anisotropic metal chalcogenide (MC) nanocrystals have recently been investigated with much interest (with regard to their applications), remarkable advances have been made with anisotropic nanocrystals in diverse areas of modern technology.1 These MC nanocrystals are also strong candidate materials for thermoelectric devices. Energy harvested from heat loss and cooling electronic devices by effective heat transfer has motivated the studies on the chalcogenide-based thermoelectric devices.26 In photovoltaic and photodector devices, MC nanocrystals have shown to absorb sun light; hence they can function as exiton generators and charge transport materials.27–29 The MC nanocrystals with a layered crystal structure and their composites with carbon materials are promising candidates that can intercalate Li+ ions reversibly, which can be used as electrodes for batteries.30–33 In addition to these applications, novel applications are recently being investigated for these MCs. As an alternative to noble metals, doped MC nanostructure has attracted interest as an efficient catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction34,35 and as a patternable material whose localized surface plasmon resonance is tunable.36,37 The topological insulating characteristics38 and superconductivity39 of MC nanostructures are also considered as new areas of research for this class of materials.
Anisotropic MC nanocrystals have predominantly been synthesized in solutions because the size and shape of the nanocrystals can be controlled precisely and the solution-processed printing is an inexpensive way to produce MC films.40–43 Chalcogens (S, Se, Te) and certain MCs are representative materials having the preferred directional growth. The shape of nanocrystals is known to be dominated by the total minimum surface energy of the crystal facets; this is known as the Gibbs–Wulff theorem.44 In many chalcogenides, the minimized total surface energies are found in the 1-D shapes because of the asymmetric bond strength. Se and Te are well known to grow into nanowires or nanotubes.45,46 The layer-structured chalcogenides grow into 2-D nanoplates or nanosheets, as frequently observed in Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3, MoS2, and SnS2, etc.Table 1 summarizes the thermodynamic preference in shape and crystal structure of MC nanocrystals. It varies in the metal species and the stoichiometric ratio of the metal to chalcogen (MxQy, M = metal, Q = S, Se, Te). These materials, according to each category, are listed and the tendency to form the anisotropic shape is noted as ‘strong’ or ‘medium’ in the table. The preparation of chalcogenides that do not have any preferential growth direction requires purposeful shape-guiding. Normally, the shape of nanocrystals obtained through thermodynamically controlled growth reflects the inherent symmetry of the crystal structure, which is spherical or near spherical due to uniform growth of all crystal facets. Reduction of the surface energy of a certain facet is a powerful way to obtain anisotropic MCs, which can be achieved by selectively attaching organic surfactants or using the organic templates as the shape-determining reactor. The MC nanocrystals can then be merged to form 1-D or 2-D nanostructures. Such oriented attachment can be tailored by engineering the interaction between the nanocrystals. Chemical transformation of pre-existing anisotropic nanocrystals into others has recently received a lot of interest because it allows preparation of nanocrystals that are chemically different, but have the same shape and dimensions. MC nanocrystals reported to date are tabulated (Table 2) according to their synthetic pathways.

This review highlights the common solution-based synthesis of anisotropic MC nanocrystals and the recent advances in applications, with some guidance from first-principle simulations and computations. The synthetic pathways of 1-D and 2-D structures are dealt with in separate sections. We begin with the direct synthesis from organometal precursors and then review the chemical transformation of the premade nanocrystals into others. The Applications section mainly focuses on the research areas which can be practically meaningful in the near future, and then introduces a few emerging topics in physics and chemistry. We conclude this review with discussion on the challenges and future directions of the solution-based synthesis and its applications.
2. Direct synthesis of 1-D chalcogenides
2.1. Intrinsically anisotropic growth
Selenium (Se) and tellurium (Te) inherently grow into anisotropic nanostructures due to the covalent bond in a helical chain along the c-axis. The helical chains are hexagonally closely packed through van der Waals interactions. Thus, the stronger atomic bond strength in the c-axis results in rapid growth along that direction. Fig. 1A shows the crystal structure of Te with the lattice spacings calculated by the density-functional theory (DFT) with Grimme's van der Waals correction.47 We performed the DFT calculation within generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for the exchange–correlation functional, given by Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE) as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).48 The kinetic energy cutoff for the plane-wave basis set is set to 500 eV and the core level interactions are represented by the projector augmented wave (PAW) potentials.49 From our first-principle density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, we find that the surface energy of the basal plane (normal to the c-axis) is indeed relatively higher (0.616 J m−2) than those of the prism planes (∼0.463 J m−2), clearly reflecting that cutting the stronger covalent bonds in the c-direction involves a larger energetic cost to form those surfaces. Due to this difference in surface energies, the calculated theoretical Gibbs–Wulff shape favors growth along the c-axis rather than the a- and b-axes. This corroborates the fact that selenium nanowires are reported to show a preferential growth along the [001] direction in a wet chemical process.50 The 1-D growth of this system is also attributed to the minimization of the area of facets (i.e. basal planes) with relatively high surface energies, lowering the total free energy of the system. But in a dry vapor–solid process with relatively high temperature (∼950 °C), the seed effect was found to be more dominant in the growth of nanowires.51

Considerable effort has been devoted to generate diverse 1-D Se and Te nanostructures by solution-based synthesis.52–66 Yu and co-workers synthesized t-Te nanowires 4–9 nm in diameter and hundreds of micrometers in length using hydrothermal methods (Fig. 1B and C).67 HR-TEM images clearly showed that the t-Te nanowires grew predominantly along the c-axis. Because Se and Te can form a solid solution on the basis of the Hume-Rothery rule, binary SexTey alloys also tend to grow favorably along the c-axis, allowing the formation of SexTey and SexTey@Te core–shell nanorods.68,69
Pnictogen chalcogenides, M2Q3 (M = Bi, Sb; Q = S, Se, Te), are nanocrystals with a highly anisotropic crystal structure. Pnictogen chalcogenides have been extensively investigated because of their promising thermoelectric and optoelectronic properties. Interestingly, in addition to their 2-D structures, Bi2S3, Sb2S3, and Sb2Se3 possess a strong tendency to grow along the c-axis into a 1-D nanostructure. Such tendency is attributed to the chain-like molecular conformation that results from V–VI bonding and van der Waals interactions between the chains (Fig. 1D). This anisotropic growth mode may, once again, be accounted for on thermodynamic grounds, referring to their surface Gibbs free energy differences between different surfaces. This is illustrated using the orthorhombic Bi2S3 as an example. Using first-principle DFT calculations, it was shown that the surface free energy of the (001) surface of Bi2S3 (0.423 J m−2) was higher than those of other low-index surfaces.70 Two other low index facets—(100) and (010) facets (0.359 J m−2 and 0.349 J m−2, respectively)—had slightly different surface energies, but were both similarly lower than that of (001). Thus, to afford the minimization of the free energy of the system during growth, Bi2S3 is thermodynamically driven to conform to a crystal morphology (i.e. a rod-like shape) which minimizes the area of the (001) facet, while maximizing that of the other two facets. A schematic of this equilibrium crystal shape of Bi2S3 is shown in Fig. 1D.
In numerous experimental studies, Bi2S3 nanorods were synthesized through a hot injection method with elemental sulfur, bismuth chloride, and oleylamine.71 Bismuth chloride dissolved in oleylamine was first transformed into BiOCl, then further reduced into elemental bismuth by the amine groups when the solution was heated up to 170 °C. Uniformly sized Bi2S3 nanorods were produced by rapid hot injection of a sulfur solution. The as-synthesized Bi2S3 nanorods were single crystals that showed preferential growth along the [001] direction (Fig. 1E and F). If some form of kinetic hindrance occurs during the reaction, the final shape of nanocrystals may deviate from the ideal one-dimensional morphology, e.g. partially generating quasi-two-dimensional crystals as the kinetic shape. This could then explain the experimental observation in the growth of Bi2S3 nanowires, where small portions of nanoplates were grown together with thin and long nanowires.72 This delicate difference in the relative surface free energy of the various prism facets of Bi2S3 can be used to tailor and design the desired morphology for its specific application. Sb2S3 and Sb2Se3 favorably crystallized into nanorods with an orthorhombic crystal structure.73 Zheng and co-workers reported the hydrothermal synthesis of 1-D Sb2Se3 nanostructures with controlled aspect ratios.74 Short nanorods were produced at high temperatures (150 °C), which is due to rapid exhaustion of the sources (Sb3+ and Se2−) and sequential lack of driving force for nucleation and growth into nanowires. Thick, long nanorods were prepared at high concentrations by a continuous reaction between Sb3+ and Se2−. The diameter of the nanowires slightly increased with the prominent increase of the length until the sources were consumed completely.74
2.2. Growth by surface energy control
During thermodynamic growth of nuclei, the fastest growing facets should disappear eventually due to the increased surface energy, while the slowest growing facets should survive as the final planes of the product. Controlled growth of nanocrystals with anisotropic morphologies has been extensively investigated by adjusting organic surfactants over the past two decades. Although MC nanoparticles with diverse asymmetric shapes had been experimentally achieved by controlling the surface energies, the interactions between organic molecules and specific facets are still not clearly understood. This surface energy minimization possibly enables evolution into 1-D nanostructures in a way that the specific binding of surfactant molecules to a preferred facet reduces the surface energy of the plane. First principle electronic structure simulation revealed the effect of organic surfactant binding on the various surfaces of a CdSe crystal.75,76 The typical capping agents include phosphonic acids (PA), phosphine oxides (PO), trimethylamines (TMA), and carboxylic acids (CA). The (0001), (000), (010), and (110) facets were selected and systematically examined on the effect of binding energy with ligands. Fig. 2A shows the configurations of the PO and PA bound to the four facets of Cd33Se33 dots. The energy was stable when Cd or Se atoms made bonds with the oxygen double bonded to the phosphor (PO and PA) or the carbon (CA). For TMA molecules, the binding took place between Cd or Se atoms and the lone pair electrons on the nitrogen atom. Binding energies between the surfactant molecules and the facets of CdxSex (x = 15, 33) were calculated (Table 3). PO and PA were found to bind more strongly to the nonpolar side facets with Bravais indices (010) or (110) than to the polar surfaces (0001) and (000). The preference in binding facets indicates faster growth of polar facets than the nonpolar facets for reducing the total surface energies of the resulting nanostructures. For polar facets, the binding energies of these surfactants to the (0001) surface were much smaller than those to the (000) surface, indicating that the growth of CdSe along the c-axis would be dominated by the Se-terminated (0001) facet. In many experimental synthesis reactions, CdSe spheres have been produced in the presence of CA surfactants,77 which is attributed to the small and weak binding energies of CA on the CdSe surfaces. Unlike other surfactants, trimethylamine (TMA) binds slightly stronger to the Se-terminated (0001) facets, which can induce the faster growth of Cd-dominated (000) along the c-axis.

The crystal structures could be engineered by surfactant molecules through fine-tuning of surface energies. Generally, wurtzite is a thermodynamically stable crystal structure for both CdS and CdSe in bulk states. The metastable zinc blend phase has been mainly allowed at low reaction temperature (<240 °C) or in small size limit (<4.5 nm). Indeed, zinc blend CdS nanowires with 15 nm diameter could be successfully synthesized even at high reaction temperature (310 °C). Theoretical analysis confirmed that trioctylphosphine (TOP) molecules are likely to bind strongly to the (001) surface of the zinc blend CdS than to the surfaces of the wurtzite CdS (Table 3).78 In some cases, a mixture of surfactants can effectively direct 1-D growth. Ultrathin (1.7 nm) hexagonal Cu2S nanowires as long as tens of micrometers were successfully synthesized using a mixture of dodecanethiol (DT) and oleic acid (OA) as the solvent.79 DT served as the primary capping ligand for nanowire growth through the formation of thiol-to-Cu(I) bonding on the surface. The growth of Cu2S nanowires could be attributed to the synergistic effect of the solvent OA and the adsorbent affinity of DT.
The energy decrease of the target facet by the organic surfactant is often not large enough to guide the growth to a 1-D nanostructure. In this case, use of an organic template whose molecules form complexes with the inorganic sources can be a powerful way to generate anisotropic nanocrystals.80–82 Due to the preferential bonding of the organic molecule to a specific inorganic element, the inner surface of the template is covered by the preferred element. The reduced atoms are stabilized by the complex molecules and nuclei are initiated at the inner surface of the template. Consecutive assembly of the inorganic elements in a 1-D template facilitates the growth into nanowires. Ma and co-workers demonstrated that PbTe can be synthesized into nanowires and nanorods in the presence of sucrose templating molecules.82 Normally, PbTe grows thermodynamically into spherical or cubic nanoparticles due to its preferred isotropic cubic crystal structure. The key factor in promoting the 1-D growth was the addition of sucrose, which has hydroxyl groups that interact exclusively with Pb (Fig. 2B). In addition, the π–π electron interactions of sucrose served as an organic template for the growth of nanowires. PbTe nanocubes and flower-shaped clusters were synthesized under the same conditions when sucrose was replaced by other typical surfactants such as trioctylphosphine (TOP) and trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO). Selective interactions between the hydroxyl groups and Pb atoms were confirmed by replacing Pb with Pt in the same synthesis process. The Pt source caused the formation of highly agglomerated randomly shaped PtTe crystals under the same experimental conditions. This result suggests the lack of effective interactions between sucrose and both elements (Pt, Te). PbTe nanowires with a thickness of 10–16 nm and a length of 400–600 nm were obtained in the presence of sucrose by injecting precursors into a pentanediol solvent heated at 210 °C.
This templating approach is a promising way to synthesize diverse MC nanocrystals. However, several factors determining the shape of the nanocrystals are mingled; the effect of the reduction rate of the precursors, the change of dipole according to the solvent in use, the stability and thermodynamic shape of the template under the synthesis conditions, and so on. Hence, weak complexation between the source element and surfactant molecules may not be large enough to generate stable templates. In this case, the use of the ionic surfactants can be a noticeable approach to produce anisotropic nanocrystals. The molecules containing ionic charges exist in the forms of vesicles or micelles when their concentration is over a critical value. Zhang and coworkers successfully synthesized Sb2Te3 nanobelts with a length of several tens to hundred micrometers in the presence of an anionic surfactant, sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate (AOT).83 The pnictogen chalcogenides such as Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3, and Sb2Te3 have been known to preferentially form 2-D anisotropic crystal structures. However, the AOT molecules suppressed the growth along the a- or b- axes of the Sb2Te3 crystals and formed 1-D templates in which the growth of the crystals is confined. In the absence of AOT, irregular 2-D nanoplates were obtained under identical reaction conditions (Fig. 2C). Ionic surfactant AOT has also been used for controlled synthesis and evolution of ZnS nanowires with diameters of 30 nm and lengths up to 2.5 μm.84 At specific AOT concentration, a rod-like micelle of AOT acts as a template for the formation of ZnS nanowires. Zn–thiourea complexes may undergo slow decomposition to produce nanowires in the micelle templates. The same group has also produced ZnSe nanorods using the AOT micelle-template.85
2.3. Axial growth by oriented attachment of nanocrystals
Classically, crystals have been considered to grow through (i) spontaneous growth of nuclei by consecutive atomic addition or (ii) dissolution of unstable small particles followed by reprecipitation onto more stable particles. The latter concept, the so-called Ostwald ripening process, is based on the solubility difference explained by the Gibbs–Thompson equation.86,87 The ripening process has been used to explain particle coarsening, but cannot fully explain the crystal growth behavior or the shape evolution.88 Since Penn and Banfield first pioneered the oriented attachment as a new crystal growth mechanism,89–91 several anisotropic growth mechanisms of MC nanocrystals including CdTe, CdSe, CdS, PbSe, ZnS, and ZnSe, have been explained.92–99 The oriented attachment refers to the direct self-organization of two particles into a single crystal caused by sharing a common crystallographic orientation. A large single crystal can form through consecutive attachment of the small nanocrystals, which is different from the simple physical assembly of nanomaterials (which we will discuss later). Because the oriented attachment involves the assembly of nanocrystal building blocks, tailoring the way of attachment generates 1-D or 2-D structures with tunable properties. The driving force of this attachment is removal of the high-energy surfaces.88 As particles approach one another in solution, they are assembled by additional energy between the surfactants (van der Waals interactions or dipole interactions). When the areal density of the capping agent on high energy surfaces is low or negligible, the surfaces meet each other and form long nanowires or nanobelts (Fig. 3A). The defects such as misorientation and stacking faults are caused by the direct coagulation of the nanocrystals.100,101 After coalescence, the nanocrystals are thought to rearrange into a particle with identical crystallography, which raises the possibility of transformation into a large single crystal.102,103 The epitaxial rearrangement takes place through relaxation of the stress caused by misorientation at the attachment interface. However, the growth via the ripening process can occur simultaneously along orientated attachment. Theoretical and experimental studies have demonstrated that strong surface adsorption of capping ligands to a specific facet can hinder growth via the ripening process and facilitate pure oriented growth.104–106 Surface adsorption of anions was confirmed to slow down the ripening process because the anions were able to effectively restrict the dissolution of particles in solution.107

Barnard and co-workers have demonstrated experimentally and theoretically that the growth of CdSe nanowire is based on the oriented attachment rather than the continuous axial growth of nanorods (Fig. 3A and B).108 CdSe nanowires were synthesized by reacting cadmium acetate (CdAc2) and selenourea in an alkylamine solution (octylamine or oleylamine). The synthesis involved three different growth stages: (i) the formation of initial nanocrystals, (ii) formation of pre-wire aggregates with the configuration of a string of pearls, and (iii) structural transformation into single-crystal nanowires by thermally annealing the pre-wire aggregates. The pre-wire aggregates whose thickness was similar to the diameter of nanocrystals could be interpreted as the key evidence of the oriented attachment. The oriented attachment was described with a thermodynamic model based on the Gibbs free energy. The total free energy G is described in terms of surface energy (γ) weighted by the factor f (such that ), (1)where ΔG0f is the standard free energy for the formation of bulk materials, M is the molar mass, ρ is the density, q is the surface to volume ratio, and e is the volume dilation induced by the surface stresses σi. Details about the assumptions and simplification can be found in ref. 108. According to the thermodynamic model and first-principle calculations, CdSe basically prefers to grow as short nanorods (aspect ratio: 2–4), indicating that the thermodynamic axial growth by consecutive atomic addition is not a dominant formation mechanism. Furthermore, kinetically controlled axial growth alone was also proved not to be a dominant mechanism from the calculation of the nucleation probability on the surfaces of the CdSe nanorods. The growth along the 〈0001〉 direction via attachment of (0001) facets was the most, energetically, stable for the growth of CdSe nanowires.
Murray and co-workers synthesized nearly defect-free and highly uniform PbSe nanowires via the oriented attachment.96 By tailoring reaction conditions, nanowires with diverse shapes were prepared such as straight, zigzag, helical, branched, and tapered nanowires. Attachment of the {100}, {110}, or {111} facets was dependent on the chemical nature of the surfactant(s) used in the synthesis. In the presence of oleic acid only or the co-surfactants of oleic acid and n-tetradecylphosphonic acid (TDPA), nanocrystals assembled along the 〈100〉 axis, which was attributed to faster growth of the {111} facet than the {100} facet. Dipole moment along the 〈100〉 axis aligned the nanocrystals into nanowires. By replacing TDPA with long, aliphatic primary amines (dodecylamine, hexadecylamine (HDA), oleylamine, etc.), octahedral PbSe nanocrystals containing eight {111} facets formed preferentially due to selective blocking of the {111} facets by the binding of amines. Two types of zigzag nanowires were obtained depending on the attachment mode of the octahedron nanocrystals (Fig. 3C and D). Helical nanowires formed when HDA and oleic acid were used as co-surfactants in the reaction medium of trioctylamine. Although PbSe crystals have a highly symmetric cubic structure, oriented attachment leads to successful synthesis of PbSe nanowires with the same crystal structure. The concept of dipole–dipole interactions as a driving force directing 1-D nanostructures has been proposed previously.92 In a subsequent study, Murray and co-workers reported the formation of PbSe/PbS core–shell heterostructures using the pre-formed PbSe nanowires as the building blocks.109
Highly uniform nanocrystals can assemble to form superstructures with regular particle–particle distances. Self-assembly of the nanocrystals is governed by the attractive forces between the nanocrystals such as van der Waals, Coulombic, and dipole–dipole interactions. It is, currently, not under precise control whether the nanocrystals evolve into a superstructure by the physical self-assembly or grow into a single crystal by the oriented attachment. One of the key factors inducing the oriented attachment is the control of the degree of passivation of target surfaces with organic surfactants. The others include solvent species, reaction temperature, and concentration of nanocrystals. These interactions are often entangled, which makes it difficult to predict the product. Directed alignment of nanocrystals by external forces may help the oriented attachment process. Alignment of anisotropic nanoparticles is challenging because the interaction between anisotropic nanocrystals is direction-dependent, typically causing raft-like assembly with short range ordering.110–112 In the presence of an external electric field, the MC nanorods are forced to align along the E-field.113–115 Russell and co-workers reported ‘self-corralling’ of CdSe nanorods under an applied electric field.116 The permanent dipole moment and inherent dielectric properties of CdSe nanorods enhanced the alignment of nanorods along their long axis, parallel to the field. This alignment followed by epitaxial merging of the nanocrystals may enable the preparation of long single-crystal nanowires, which may allow the fabrication of aligned nanowires on a substrate.
3. Direct synthesis of 2-D chalcogenides
3.1. Intrinsically anisotropic 2-D growth
The shape of nanocrystals is dominated by the surface energy of the facets. For some MCs, 2-D shapes (nanoplates, nanodiscs, nanoflakes, nanosheets) are thermodynamically favored. Examples include the VA–VIA (GeS,117 GeSe,117 SnS,118,119 and SnSe120), VIIIB–VIA (FeSe121,122 and FeTe121), IVB–VIA (TiQ2,123–127 ZrQ2, and HfQ2, Q = S, Se, Te123,124,126,128), VB–VIA (NbSe2 (ref. 126 and 129) and TaSe2 (ref. 126 and 130)), VIB–VIA (MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2 (ref. 131−133)), and VA–VIA (Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3, and Sb2Te3 (ref. 134−139)). The structural preferences of the materials listed above have been confirmed by theoretical studies123,140 and vapor-phase synthesis141–143 which has no surfactant-driven effect. The basic crystal structures of the metal chalcogenides are illustrated in Fig. 4. They commonly assume the chemical stoichiometries of MX2 or M2X3, where M is the metal and X is the chalcogen. In these structures, the M atoms are often 6-fold coordinated (octahedral distortion occurs when M is a VB or VIB metal atom; see Fig. 4A, B and D), while the X atoms are 3-fold coordinated (and also 6-fold in the case of M2X3; see Fig. 4C). Due to this unique structuring, the 3-fold coordinated X chalcogenide ions form localized pairs of electrons, frequently leading to the formation of van der Waals-bonded layered structures, exposing X-terminated layers. Metal chalcogenides may occasionally take on the MX stoichiometry and assume the distorted B1 structure (Fig. 4E). These metal chalcogenides are characterized by a MX stoichiometric bi-layered structure, weakly bonded by van der Waals forces.
 Fig. 4  Crystal structures of various MC layered materials: Schematic descriptions of various metal chalcogenide crystals with layered geometry with stoichiometries MX2 (in A, B, and D), M2X3 (in C), and MX (in E). 
In solution-based synthesis, the use of surfactants to prevent aggregation of nanocrystals affects the thermodynamic preference and often generates unexpected structures. Jeong and co-workers recently reported a surfactant-free synthesis of Bi2Te3 and Bi2Se3 nanoflakes in a gram scale (Fig. 5).137 Formation of the 2-D nanocrystals in the absence of any surfactant is a strong evidence of the preference in the growth direction. The layered crystal structures of bismuth chalcogenides are illustrated in Fig. 5A. Five successive atomic planes [Te1(Se1)–Bi–Te2(Se2)–Bi–Te1(Se1)] constitute one quintuple along the c-axis. Basically, bismuth chalcogenides preferentially grow into 2-D nanostructures because of weak van der Waals interactions between adjacent Te1(Se1) atomic planes that confer bismuth chalcogenides with an intrinsically anisotropic bonding nature. Because the top and bottom surfaces which consist of Te or Se atoms are not stabilized by the surfactant, secondary nanoplates grow vertically, as shown in Fig. 5B and D. Clear lattice fringes are visible in the HR-TEM images shown in Fig. 5C (Bi2Te3) and Fig. 5E (Bi2Se3) and the corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) patterns demonstrate the single crystalline nature of the nanoplates. The cross-section of the Bi2Se3 nanocrystals (Fig. 5F) indicated 6 quintuple thickness.

As long as the agglomeration is avoided or the aggregates are redispersed in solution by ultrasonic treatment, synthesis of the surfactant-free 2-D nanocrystals deserves further investigation. The layer-structured MCs have a high chance of success to be produced in the absence of a surfactant. In most layered MCs, stacking of the atomic layer ends typically with the negatively charged chalcogen atoms or the positively charged metal atoms. Depending on the metal species and crystal structure, the uniform direction of the dipoles over the large basal planes provides better colloidal stability compared to the isotropic particles. A small amount of inorganic chalcogenide ligands may greatly enhance the colloidal stability in polar solvents. Recently, Talapin and coworkers found that various molecular metal chalcogenide complexes (MCCs) such as [Sn2S6]4− and [Sn2Se6]4− could serve as convenient ligands for colloidal nanocrystals.144 The surface inorganic surfactants greatly facilitate charge transport between individual nanocrystals.145 The insulating organic surfactants of the typical 2-D nanocrystals diminish the unique properties of the 2-D nanocrystals such as high electron mobility and topological insulation. The inorganic ligands may allow the use of solution-based 2-D MCs as the semiconducting active layer for future electronic devices.
3.2. Surfactant-driven growth of 2-D nanocrystals
2-D growth of MCs that does not form a layered structure is a challenging subject because of the lack of a driving force for anisotropic growth. As in the case of 1-D growth, 2-D chalcogenide nanostructures can be obtained via surfactant-driven growth. In addition to lowering the surface energy of specific facets, surfactants can serve as soft templates for 2-D nanocrystals. For example, the hexagonal wurtzite crystals normally grow isotropically into 0-D nanocrystals or into 1-D nanowires because the (0001) facet has the highest surface energy.146 Recently, Hyeon and coworkers succeeded in preparing lamellar-structured CdSe nanosheets as thin as 1.4 nm.147 They employed a soft colloidal template method, in which organic layers consisting of cadmium chloride and alkyl amine complexes functioned as 2-D templates to generate CdSe nanosheets. In a zinc blend cubic structure, polar axes along the 〈111〉 or 〈001〉 direction usually facilitate 1-D nanocrystal growth. Such dipole moments exist at the alternating layers of Cd and Se elements. Recently, Peng and co-workers synthesized CdSe 2-D quantum disks (1–3 nm in thickness) with a zinc blend crystal structure.148 The 2-D CdSe quantum disks were synthesized by suppressing the growth along the polar axes. More specifically, basal planes with exposed layers of Cd ions were passivated by the negatively charged carboxylate groups of the deprotonated fatty acid ligands, thereby neutralizing the dipole from the Cd ions. The close packing of the hydrocarbon chains of the fatty acids enabled the 2-D growth of CdSe nanocrystals. Various 2-D chalcogenide nanocrystals with non-layered structures have also been prepared using a similar synthetic route, including Cu2−xSe nanodiscs,149 In2S3 nanosheets,150 and NiTe2 nanoflakes.151 Dubertret and co-workers extended this strategy to synthesize CdSe/CdS and CdSe/CdZnS core–shell nanoplatelets.152 They first synthesized zinc blend CdSe nanoplatelets capped by carboxylate ligands,153 and exchanged the ligand by dodecanethiol without disrupting the shape of the thin nanoplatelets. Layer-by-layer deposition of S and Cd enabled CdS coating with a controllable shell-thickness.
The organic surfactants can serve as a carbon source during high temperature sintering. Very recently, carbon-coated FeS nanosheets with lateral lengths of 100–200 nm and thicknesses of 4–10 nm have been prepared by surfactant-assisted solution-based synthesis.154 The governing factor in controlling the morphology of the FeS nanocrystals was the shape of the micelle directed by 1-dodecanethiol (DDT). DDT was used as both the sulfur source and the surfactant to produce the 2-D FeS nanostructures. At a high concentration of DDT (molar ratio of Fe(acac)3:DDT = 1:20), an Fe–DDT complex with a lamellar structure was formed in an oleylamine solution. The complex served as a soft template for the nucleation and growth of the FeS nanosheets. Spherical micelles of an Fe–DDT complex were formed at a lower concentration of DDT (1:4); hence polycrystalline nanoparticles of FeS were produced. The hydrocarbon tails of DDT at the surfaces of the nanosheets turned into an amorphous carbon layer after sintering at 400 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere, resulting in the formation of carbon-coated FeS nanosheets.
Surfactants can tweak the growth conditions for further fine-tuning of the 2-D growth regime. The effects of surfactants on the synthesis of ultrathin (∼4 nm) Bi2Se3 nanodiscs and nanosheets have recently been investigated (Fig. 6).136 Bi2Se3 grew faster laterally and the basal planes were covered with negatively charged Se atoms. When a negatively charged surfactant, poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), was used, flower-like nanocrystals were obtained, which were similar to the surfactant-free products. In contrast, well-defined Bi2Se3 nanodiscs were obtained in the presence of a weakly positive polymer surfactant, poly(vinylpyrollidone) (PVP). The effect of surfactant charge on the 2-D shape formation was examined by mixing PVP and poly(ethylene imine) (PEI) as co-surfactants at different molar ratios: 10:0 (Fig. 6A and B), 9:1 (Fig. 6C), 8:2 (Fig. 6D), 3:7 (Fig. 6E), and 0:10 (Fig. 6F). Binding of the positively charged primary amines to the basal plane was much stronger than that of the tertiary amines in PVP. As the molar ratio of PEI increased, the surface energy of the basal plane decreased, resulting in wide nanosheets with the thickness of the nanodiscs maintained. This effect of surfactant charge was utilized to synthesize various 2-D MCs in the form of nanoplates and nanosheets. Sb2Te3 hexagonal nanoplates have been synthesized using both solvothermal138 and hydrothermal approaches.139

3.3. Formation of 2-D nanocrystals by lateral attachment
Although oriented attachment is a relatively new synthetic route, recent advances have proven that this strategy can be used to generate diverse 2-D MC nanocrystals.155–160 Preparation of the 2-D MC nanocrystals by the oriented attachment is relatively easier than the formation of 1-D nanocrystals by the same approach. The layer-structured MCs tend to expose chalcogen atoms on the top and bottom surfaces of the nanocrystals. Thus, passivation of those surfaces can be selectively achieved even with weakly binding surfactants rather than that of the side surfaces. Growth into nanoplates or nanosheets is energetically favorable due to the reduced surface energy on the top and bottom surfaces. The side surfaces with a higher energy should be the active sites leading to the oriented attachment. This oriented attachment is expected to be more effective when the thickness of the nanocrystals is small and the binding of surfactants to the top and bottom surfaces is strong.
The time-dependent shape evolution during the lateral oriented attachment has been observed in several 2-D MC nanocrystal systems.136,161 For example, single-crystalline SnSe nanosheets with a thickness of ∼1 nm and a width of ∼300 nm are synthesized by heating a mixture solution of SeO2, SnCl4·5H2O, oleylamine, and 1,10-phenanthroline (Phen) at 120 °C followed by aging at 260 °C for 30 min. The TEM studies visualized the growth process which included nucleation of SnSe nanocrystals, aggregation of the nanocrystals into 2-D polycrystalline pseudo-sheets, and transformation of the pseudo-sheets into single-crystalline nanosheets. This growth mechanism was consistent with the result demonstrated by Schaak and co-workers.120 In their synthesis, 1,10-phenanthroline (Phen) played a vital role as a capping agent in determining the formation of SnSe nanosheets. In an early stage, Phen bound strongly to the basal plane of the newly formed SnSe nanosheets in cooperation with oleylamine, which suppressed the vertical growth of nanosheets. In the absence of Phen, 3-D SnSe nanoflowers were obtained because the stabilization of the basal plane by oleylamine molecules was insufficient to prevent the second growth of SnSe nanoplates on the basal planes.
Weller and co-workers utilized this strategy to synthesize PbS nanosheets from PbS nanoparticles158 (Fig. 7). They based their approach on the standard synthetic protocol used to prepare spherical PbS nanoparticles except the addition of chlorine-containing solvents such as 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) to the oleic acid. In the absence of a DCE solvent, PbS nanoparticles were prepared as illustrated in path A of Fig. 7A. The chlorine-containing solvent modified the nucleation and growth rate during primary nanocrystal formation, which enabled survival of the highly reactive {110} surfaces in small nanocrystals during the early stage of the reaction. These tiny nanocrystals merged into 2-D nanosheets (paths B and C in Fig. 7A) because the oleic acid self-assembled monolayer exclusively decreased the surface energy of the {100} facet. Growth of the nanosheet was monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy (Fig. 7B) and HR-TEM (Fig. 7C–F). During the early stage of the reaction, small and isolated quantum dots appeared in ∼50 s, as shown by the black spectrum in Fig. 7B and the HR-TEM image in Fig. 7C. As the reaction evolved, the fluorescence band of the quantum dots decreased and an absorption peak corresponding to the nanosheet became visible as the oriented attachment of the primary nanocrystals proceeded.

4. Chemical transformation
Chemical transformation from a premade nanocrystal into another is a powerful route to obtain nanocrystals of diverse shapes and chemical compositions that cannot be obtained directly via the conventional synthetic approaches.162,163 The synthetic parameters to control the size, shape, and composition of the product nanocrystals are mingled in classical solution-based synthesis. Such multiple control factors interrupt fine-tuning of these variables. However, chemical transformation without any separate homogeneous nucleation allows systematic control over synthetic variables. Chemical transformation of nanomaterials has been exploited as a new synthetic tool to generate 1-D and 2-D nanostructures. It allows the synthesis of materials that are not obtainable by direct synthesis. The simple structure of an initial template material can be transformed into a complicated structure.
Chemical transformation can be divided into three categories based on the underlying mechanism: alloy formation, ion exchange reaction, and galvanic replacement. Alloy formation is accomplished by mutual diffusion between atoms in premade solids and dissolved atoms in a reduced form. This strategy has been used to generate various MC nanostructures with diverse morphologies including nanoparticles (ZnS,164 CdS,165 PbS166), nanotubes (Ag2Se,167 Bi2Te3,168,169 CoTe2,170 CoTe171), nanowires (Ag2Se,66,172 Ag2Te,162,173 Bi2Te3,174 CdTe,175 PbTe,175,176 La2Te3 (ref. 177)), heterojunction double dumbbell Ag2Te–Te–Ag2Te nanowires,178 and tri-wing Ag2Te nanoribbons.179 Chalcogens (Se, Te) are considered an ideal model system to prepare 1-D MCs because of their inherent tendency to grow into 1-D shapes and their high reactivity with metal precursors. For example, Yu and co-workers have utilized Te nanowires as starting materials to prepare various 1-D metal telluride nanostructures (Bi2Te3, CdTe, PbTe).174,175 The reaction processes were simple. Metal cations (Bi3+, Cd2+, Pb2+) were reduced to their neutral elements (Bi, Cd, Pb) using hydrazine hydrate as a reducing agent. The neutral elements reacted with Te nanowires to form metal telluride nanowires. An example of the CdTe system is provided below: 2Cd2+ + N2H4 + 4OH− → 2Cd + N2 + 4H2O(2) Cd + Te (nanowires) → CdTe (nanowires)(3)
Exchange of metal cations in the MC nanocrystals is a useful technique to diversify the accessible material species. Chalcogen anions, which are typically larger than metal cations, play a vital role as a frame preserving the structure of MC materials. Metal cations are mobile within their ionic structures; hence they can be replaced by other cations under appropriate conditions. Numerous research groups have used a solution phase approach to generate a 1-D chalcogenide nanostructure via cation exchange reactions (CdTe,162 ZnTe,162 PbTe,162 and CdSe66,180 nanowires, PbS181 and ZnSe182 nanorods, and PtTe2 (ref. 162) nanotubes). Jeong and co-workers systematically demonstrated the chemical transformation of Te nanowires into Ag2Te nanowires via a topotactic alloying process, and then subsequently conducted cation exchange using the Ag2Te nanowires to generate diverse MC nanowires (CdTe, ZnTe, PbTe) and PtTe2 nanotubes (Fig. 8A).162 The as-synthesized Te nanowires with a single-crystal structure (Fig. 8B) transformed spontaneously into single crystalline Ag2Te nanowires with no drastic morphological changes (Fig. 8C). This structural preservation can be explained by topotatic lattice matching between trigonal Te and monoclinic Ag2Te lattices, despite the large volume increase during transformation. Compared to Ag2Te, other metal tellurides (CdTe, ZnTe, PbTe) are more soluble in polar solvents, which thermodynamically prohibits cation exchange to create other metal telluride nanowires from Ag2Te (Fig. 8D). Cation exchange was successfully accomplished by introducing a complexation ligand, tributylphosphine (TBP), which selectively binds to silver. This example proves that careful choice of ligands can facilitate thermodynamically unfavorable exchanges by reversing the solubility order. Single crystallinity was preserved in the product metal chalcogenide nanowires due to the small volume change. In the transformation of CdTe into PtTe2, cation exchange was thermodynamically favorable due to the much lower solubility of PtTe2 than that of CdTe. The exchange reaction caused a large volume decrease, resulting in the production of PtTe2 nanotubes (Fig. 8E and F).

This approach can be used to obtain 2-D nanocrystals with non-layered crystal structures. However, the chemical transformation of 2-D nanostructures remains largely unexplored. Cheon and coworkers reported the cation exchange reaction of layered TiS2 nanodiscs leading to toroidal Cu2S nanostructures (Fig. 9A).183 They first synthesized TiS2 nanodiscs stabilized by oleylamines (Fig. 9B–D). Addition of CuCl2 to the nanodisc suspension and subsequent heating at 200 °C for 30 min yielded Cu2S toroids (Fig. 9E–G). The resulting toroids with a hole in their center were highly symmetrical and double-convex. This transformation was driven by a regioselective edge reaction and ion diffusion through nanochannels between layers. The replacement of TiS2 with Cu ions took place at the edge of the nanodiscs during the early reaction stages, and then subsequent ion diffusion through the interlayer in the TiS2 nanodiscs resulted in the formation of heteroepitaxial TiS2–Cu2S intermediates. As the replacement reaction proceeded, double-convex toroidal Cu2S structures were generated.

In contrast to cation exchange, anion exchange causes considerable structural changes. Thus, more energy is required to overcome the kinetic barrier than that required for cation exchange. Anion exchange has rarely been explored compared to cation exchange reactions (CdS, CdSe, CdTe nanotubes).184,185 CdSe nanotubes with CdSe thorns on their surfaces were synthesized from Cd(OH)2 nanowire bundles through an anion exchange reaction by Se.185 Cd(OH)2 nanowire bundles were synthesized first on a glass substrate in an aqueous phase. Rapid exchange between OH− and Se2− as well as fast outward diffusion of Cd2+ in the aqueous solution resulted in the formation of tubular structures. Subsequent nucleation and growth of CdSe thorns on the nanotube surface proceeded until the Cd sources were consumed completely. The surface morphology of the nanotubes was dependent on the concentration of the Se ions. Nanotubes with clean and smooth surfaces were formed without any thorn at high Se concentrations, which was attributed to uniform chemical reaction along the entire length of the nanowire bundles. Meanwhile, CdSe thorns on the nanotube were generated at low Se concentrations due to localized exchange reactions with Cd2+ ions diffusing out from the bundles. The anion exchange reaction was also observed in tin chalcogenide structures. SnSe nanosheets with a layered structure were transformed into SnTe nanosheets with a non-layered cubic structure, via solution phase anion exchange.186 The bond energy difference between trioctylphosphine (TOP) as a chalcogen complex agent and chalcogen elements drove the exchange reaction. Because the PSe bond is stronger than the PTe bond, TOP–Se is favorably formed in a reaction system that includes TOP–Te and SnSe, which drives the anion exchange reaction. SnTe nucleated with crystallographic alignment on SnSe nanosheets, which were consumed to yield porous SnTe nanosheets.
Galvanic replacement is considered a simple and effective way to prepare 1-D noble metal nanostructures.187 The redox potential difference between elements leads to deposition of the more noble elements and dissolution of the less noble elements. Yang and co-workers utilized redox reactions to prepare Au, Ag, Pd, and Pt nanowires from LiMo3Se3 nanowires; the latter nanowires functioned as both templates and reducing agents.188 Metal ions (AuCl4−, Ag+, PdCl42−, PtCl42−) in aqueous solutions were reduced and subsequently deposited on the nanowire templates. Meanwhile, the nanowire templates were oxidized and dissolved in aqueous solutions. The following redox reaction between LiMo3Se3 and Au took place: 3LiMo3Se3(s) + AuCl4− → Au(s) + 3Mo3Se3 + 3LiCl + Cl−(4)
Pt nanotubes, Pt nanowires, and Pd nanowires a few nanometers in diameter have been successfully prepared by galvanic replacement using Te template nanowires.189 In a typical synthesis, metal precursors (H2PtCl6, PdCl2) are added to an ethylene glycol suspension of Te nanowires at 50 °C. Interestingly, the resulting products had different morphologies. In the case of the Pt nanotubes, some Pt nanoshells formed during the early stages of the reaction, which permitted the inter-diffusion of reactant ions across the shell. As galvanic replacement proceeded, the Pt nanoshells grew inwards at the cost of the Te templates. Based on stoichiometric relationships, this reaction involves the replacement of equivalent molar amounts of Pt by TeO32−. The smaller molar volume of Pt (∼9 cm3 per mol) than that of Te (∼20 cm3 per mol) yielded a tubular structure. Furthermore, the molar volume of two moles of Pd (∼18 cm3 per 2 mol) is similar to that of 1 mol of Te, which resulted in solid Pd nanowires. In 2-D nanostructures, Sb2Te3 hexagonal nanoplates were transformed into porous 3-D network-shaped Te plates. Tartaric acid (TA) in the reaction solution aided the dissolution of Sb3+ ions from Sb2Te3 by forming Sb(TA)x3+. Simultaneously, Te2− ions were oxidized by O2 to Te0; the latter nucleated preferentially on the Sb2Te3 surfaces and acted as seeds for growth into porous 3-D Te plates. The Te structure was further transformed into porous Pt, Pd, and Au plates via galvanic replacement reactions in the presence of metal precursors (H2PtCl6, PdCl2, HAuCl4).190
5. Applications
Interest in anisotropic 1-D and 2-D nanostructures has been steadily increasing due to their large surface area, quantum confinement effect, and superior optoelectrical or thermoelectrical properties. Anisotropic geometry and size reduction comparable to the Debye length can alter the optical, electric, and magnetic properties of the bulk counterparts. Focusing on MCs prepared in solution phases, the major interest for practical applications is in thermoelectric power generation or electronic device cooling, high performance electrodes for batteries, nanocrystal-based photovoltaic devices, and photodetectors. Recently, new potential uses of the solution-based MC nanocrystals are being investigated, which include localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and oxygen reduction reaction. MC thin films prepared by the vacuum process have shown the possibilities as a new class of materials such as topological insulators, semiconductors with a high electron mobility, and superconductors. Although the organic surfactants indispensable in solution chemistry diminish such superior physical properties, the solution-based approach has a large scope to achieve such physical properties. This section reviews recent advances in the practical applications of the anisotropic MC nanocrystals, and introduces briefly the potential applications.
5.1. Anodes of Li ion batteries
Graphite, which is conventionally used as the anode of lithium ion batteries (LIBs), has a small theoretical capacity of 372 mA h g−1, which is too low to meet the current need in electronic devices. A number of 2-D metal disulfide (MS2) nanocrystals such as MoS2, WS2, and SnS2 are considered as promising alternatives to graphite.30–33 Their theoretical capacities are typically twice that of graphite and their layered structures (S–M–S) facilitate reversible intercalation of Li ions (Fig. 10A). The synthesis of the metal disulfides has been actively developed during the last five years. Hydrothermal and solvothermal methods have been widely used for the synthesis of the 2-D MS nanocrystals and their hybrid composite materials with graphene or CNTs.33,191 These methods facilitate the large scale production of the high quality 2-D MS nanocrystals at low cost and in a short processing time. The thermal decomposition approach is promising to prepare the stoichiometric 2-D MS2 nanocrystals with massive production for industrial needs.32 Free standing 2-D MoS2 or WS2 nanosheets were synthesized by decomposition of single-source precursors containing metal and sulfur sources in oleylamine which could cover the surfaces of the 2-D MS nanosheets. This oleylamine molecule functions as a protective layer for the oxidation and aggregation.192 Exfoliation of bulk materials in a liquid phase is a relatively new approach to prepare thin 2-D nanosheets.193,194 Ultrasonic treatment in organic solvents helped the exfoliation of the bulk materials. The surface energy of the bulk material in the solvent should be minimized to lower the energy requested for exfoliation; hence the surface energy of the solvent should be similar to that of the bulk material.

(B) Top- and (C) side-view TEM images of as-synthesized ZrS2 nanodiscs. (D) Cycling behaviors of ZrS2 nanodiscs with different lateral dimensions (20, 35, and 60 nm) and bulk ZrS2. (E) Current density-dependent capacity retention profiles of ZrS2 nanodiscs (20, 35, and 60 nm) and bulk ZrS2 at current densities of 69, 138, 276, and 552 mA h g−1.128 Adapted from ref. 128 with permission from American Chemical Society. 
With the thermal decomposition method, Cheon and co-workers reported that LIBs with anode electrodes fabricated with 2-D SnS2 nanoplates showed enhanced capacities.32 The discharge capacity was as high as 1311 mA h g−1 in the first cycle, which is close to the sum of the theoretical irreversible capacity (587 mA h g−1) and maximum theoretical reversible capacity (645 mA h g−1). The average discharge capacity (583 mA h g−1), close to 90% of the maximum theoretical reversible value, was stable and reversible up to 30 cycles. These excellent electrochemical properties were attributed to enhanced diffusion kinetics of lithium ions by the finite lateral size and open edges of the nanoplates. Recently, the same group synthesized ZrS2 nanodiscs with tunable lateral dimensions (20, 35, and 60 nm) and systematically studied the effect of size on Li ion intercalation (Fig. 10B and C).128 The average discharge capacities of the 20, 35, and 60 nm ZrS2 nanodiscs were 586, 527, and 433 mA h g−1, respectively (Fig. 10D). The 20 nm nanodiscs had a capacity 2.3 times greater than that of the bulk ZrS2 material (255 mA h g−1). The retention capacities of the small nanoplates were ∼80, ∼77, and ∼71% of the original capacities, respectively, while the retention of bulk ZrS2 decreased continuously and was only 39% after 50 cycles (Fig. 10E).
MS2/carbon composite nanocrystals such as FeS/C,154 SnS2/graphene,195 CoS2/C,196 MoS2/graphene,191,197 MoS2/CNTs,198 and MoS2/C possess even more outstanding electrochemical properties than bare MS2 nanoplates when they were used as anodes for LIBs.199 Incorporation of carbon materials improves the charge current, effective surface area, and chemical tolerance of MS2 nanocrystals. MoS2/graphene composite nanosheets were synthesized by a one-step solution phase method.191 The first charge and discharge capacities of the MoS2/graphene composites were 2200 and 1300 mA h g−1, respectively, which are higher than those of bare MoS2 and graphene. In addition, the cycling behavior exhibited a reversible capacity of 1290 mA h g−1 for up to 50 cycles, while the reversible capacity of the bare MoS2 electrode declined to 605 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles. The high capacity and enhanced cycling stability of the composite were attributed to effective and rapid charge carrier transport back and forth from the MoS2 layers to the graphene layer. Nanostructured SnS2, although a promising anode material for LIBs, has the drawbacks of large volume changes and accompanying decreases in capacity during electrochemical cycling.200 One solution to minimize the volume expansion is to distribute the tin-based materials evenly throughout another phase matrix. Zhi and co-workers prepared porous SnS2/graphene composites through a two-step approach.195 SnO2 nanoparticles were formed on the surface of graphene nanosheets and then transformed into 2-D SnS2 nanoplates by reaction with H2S gas. The reversible capacity of the SnS2/graphene composites was 650 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles, which is much higher than that of bare SnS2 nanoplates (277 mA h g−1). These results suggest that graphene layer functions both as a buffer matrix and a conducting pathway to improve cycling durability.
5.2. Photodetectors
Photodetectors that contain nanocrystal solids are some of the simplest optoelectronic devices. The electrical conductivity of the nanocrystal solids changes under illumination due to the increase in density of mobile charge carriers.201 Photodetectors require high sensitivity, selectivity, and stability. Many MCs have high absorption coefficient and good photostability, which are excellent characteristics of photodetecting materials. Various MC nanowires have been tested for the purpose because of their tunable electronic structure and band gap as well as the enhanced conduction of charge carriers in the length direction. Among various 1-D MC nanocrystals,202–211 silver sulfide (Ag2S) is known as an excellent optical sensing material with a superior chemical stability. Li and co-workers reported a simple route to generate single crystalline Ag2S nanowires that involves addition of sulfur powder into an octadecylamine solution containing a Ag(NO)3 precursor at 120 °C (Fig. 11).211 The nanowires had diameters ranging from 10 to 30 nm and lengths up to hundreds of micrometers. The photoelectric properties of the individual Ag2S nanowires were investigated under UV illumination. The current increased sharply from 2.3 to 594 pA upon UV illumination, but the current decreased to dark current within 1 s upon turn-off of the UV light. This time-resolved photocurrent indicates that the dynamic response was stable and reproducible during the on-and-off states (Fig. 11B). Furthermore, the photocurrent increased as the pressure decreased without detectable changes in the dark current (Fig. 11C). Golberg and co-workers demonstrated a fast response photodetector made of Sb2Se3 nanowires synthesized by a hydrothermal process.208 The current sharply increased from 4 pA (dark state) to 58 pA under 600 nm illumination. The rise and decay times were below 0.3 s. The rapid response time, high sensitivity of external quantum efficiency, good chemical stability, and good conduction along their length direction indicate that Sb2Se3 nanowires are promising candidates for photodetector devices.

Compared to conventional one-component (inorganic or organic) photodetectors, organic–inorganic hybrid photodetectors have unique features conferred by combination of the low ionization potential of organic molecules and the high electron affinity of inorganic components. These hybrid devices provide good physical flexibility and tunable functionality. Hybrid photodetectors with different combinations of organic and inorganic components have been fabricated.212–214 Hybrid photodetectors composed of conjugated polymer, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), and CdSe nanowires were fabricated on a rigid SiO/Si substrate, a flexible PET substrate, and printing paper.215 These devices showed an enhanced photocurrent and more rapid response and recovery times than photodetectors fabricated using only one component. This was attributed to the high hole-transport rate of the polymer P3HT, the high electrical conductivity of the CdSe nanowires, and the synergistic effect of absorption spectra in the visible range. The devices fabricated on flexible substrates exhibited good flexibility, folding strength, excellent wavelength-dependent electrical stability, and rapid response to high-frequency light signals.
5.3. Thermoelectric devices
Solid-state power generation and cooling systems based on thermoelectric effects have received great attention.26,216–218 Thermoelectric devices composed of p- and n-type semiconductors can directly convert waste heat to electricity and vice versa. Bi2Te3 and Bi2Te3-based materials containing elemental Se or Sb are some of the best thermoelectric materials at low temperatures (∼80 °C) and PbTe-related materials are also strong candidates at slightly higher temperatures (∼300 °C). Therefore, they have been widely used in low temperature power generation and small-scale cooling of electronic devices. The energy conversion efficiency of a thermoelectric device is evaluated by the dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT), ZT = S2σT/κ, where S, σ, T, and κ are the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, temperature, and thermal conductivity, respectively. Recent theoretical and experimental advances have confirmed that introduction of nanoscale constituents increases the power factor (S2σ) through a quantum confinement effect. The nano-sized grains reduce thermal conductivity (κ) more effectively than the reduction in electrical conductivity (σ). Furthermore, introduction of heterostructures in the nanocomposite can increase the Seebeck coefficient (S) due to a carrier filtering effect.137,218–220 In this respect, better control over the grain size and shape of thermoelectric nanocrystals can be obtained using a bottom-up solution approach.221–227
Wu and coworkers synthesized 1-D barbell-shaped Bi2Te3–Te–Bi2Te3 heterostructures consisting of a Te nanowire and Bi2Te3 plates set at the two ends of the nanowire (Fig. 12A and B).227 They used a two-step conversion process. Te nanowires were synthesized by reducing tellurium dioxide with a hydrazine hydrate solution. Once the formation of Te nanowires was completed, a bismuth nitrate solution was hot-injected into the Te nanowire suspension at 160 °C, which allowed the Te nanowires to be converted into the barbell-shaped Te–Bi2Te3 heterostructures. By keeping the concentration of Bi low, Bi deposited onto the axial growth tips and suppressed the random deposition on the surfaces in the radial direction. The heterostructured composite was fabricated by hot pressing. ZT of the heterostructured composite was two orders higher than that of a pure Te nanowire composite (Fig. 12B). The improved thermoelectric properties are mainly due to the enhanced Seebeck coefficient (S) caused by the carrier filtering and the decreased thermal conductivity (κ) caused by phonon scattering.

In terms of the grain boundaries to enhance the phonon scattering, thin 2-D nanostructures such as nanoplates or nanosheets are promising because their face-to-face packing can generate tremendous boundaries along the pathway of the phonons. Several groups have investigated 2-D Bi2Te3-related structures in the past decade.137,221–224 Hyeon and coworkers synthesized Bi2Te3 nanoplates with a thickness of ∼1 nm. They investigated the thermoelectric properties of bulk pellets prepared by spark plasma sintering (Fig. 12C and D).223 Both the electrical (σ) and thermal (κ) conductivities increased as the sintering temperature was raised due to enhanced densification and grain growth during sintering. A maximum ZT value of 0.62 was achieved at 400 K from the nanoplate bulk pellets sintered at 250 °C (Fig. 12D).
Challenging issues associated with the use of nanocrystals in electric devices are removal of organic surfactant and thermal treatment without severely damaging the as-synthesized materials. A high sintering temperature (typically >400 °C) is required to decompose the organic surfactants. The insulating organic residue left behind by incomplete removal caused the material density of the pellet to be low and decreased the power factor of thermoelectric devices. Specifically, MC nanocrystals can form multi-component alloys at high sintering temperatures, which is not desirable for high-performance, reliable devices. Jeong and coworkers demonstrated scalable, high-yield production of surfactant-free Bi2Te3 and Bi2Se3 nanoflakes.137 Simple mixing of the nanoflake suspensions allowed homogeneous distribution of the two nanocrystal species; hence fine control of the chemical composition of the Bi2Te3/Bi2Se3 nanocomposites was possible. The ZT value was 0.7 at 400 K for a broad range of Bi2Se3 contents (10–15 wt%), which is highly advantageous in preparing reliable devices because the ZT value of three component alloy nanocrystals (Bi2Te3−xSex) is too sensitive to the atomic composition of Se (x).
5.4. Solar cells
MC semiconductors have been considered promising materials for the absorber layer and charge transport layer in thin film photovoltaic devices such as CdTe solar cells and CI(G)Se solar cells. The chalcogenide films in the cells with a high power conversion efficiency (η) have been prepared by chemical bath deposition (CBD) or vapor phase deposition including evaporation, sputtering, sublimation, vapor transient deposition (VTD), and chemical vapor deposition (CVD).228–230 Recent advances in colloidal science have facilitated simple and eco-friendly synthetic approaches to produce various nanocrystals for use in photovoltaic devices. Use of the nanocrystal inks can significantly reduce production costs through the inexpensive deposition methods such as spraying, doctor blading, spin-casting, dip coating, and roll-to-roll printing. Although the films prepared from the MC nanocrystals have been considered inferior to the conventional films made by the vacuum processes, the solution-processed thin film solar cells have undergone continuous improvement in the conversion efficiency.
Several research groups have devoted considerable effort toward synthesizing various colloidal nanocrystal inks.40–43,231,232 In contrast to quasi-spherical nanocrystals, 1-D nanostructures may enhance carrier mobility and device efficiency by reducing the frequency of electron hopping and electron–hole recombination in the absorber layer film.11,233,234 Korgel and co-workers demonstrated a photovoltaic device made of CuInSe2 nanowires.234 The nanowires were 20 nm thick and several micrometers long. These were indium-deficient with an average composition of Cu1.0In0.6Se2.0. A free-standing fabric made of the nanowires was used to measure the photovoltaic response. Although the efficiency of the device was low (η = 0.1%) due to the low open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF), these results exhibited the feasibility of CuInSe2 nanowires as the active layer for photovoltaic devices. The low power conversion efficiency originated from the voids and the random orientation of the nanowires, which reduced conductivity and prevented the carrier transport to their corresponding electrodes. The nanowire/quantum dot composite device enhanced transport connectivity. Conversion efficiency could potentially be improved by preparing defect-free nanowires and optimizing the alignment of the nanowires. Combining nanowires with spherical nanocrystals could also potentially improve device performance. Incorporating colloidal CdSe quantum dots into CdSe nanowires improved the conversion efficiency (η = 0.13%) and photovoltaic performance.233 A photovoltaic device comprising CdSe quantum dots and CdTe nanorods as the active layer has also been reported.235 Due to the band alignment between the CdSe and CdTe nanocrystals, excited electrons transferred to the CdSe phase, while holes moved to the CdTe phase. Sintering of the nanorods enhanced the carrier mobility and the power conversion efficiency (η = 2.9%). Lin and coworkers utilized wurtzite-structured CdSe nanowires to fabricate a solar cell with the configuration of ITO/ZnO/CdSe NWs/PEDOT:PSS/Pt. They reported a conversion efficiency of 3.6% for this configuration.236
A remarkable improvement of the power conversion efficiency has been achieved in the solar cells based on the I–III–VI2 nanocrystals such as CuInSe2 (CISe) and Cu(InxGa1−x)Se2 (CIGSe).237–239 Facile solution synthesis of CISe and related nanocrystal inks has been developed to prepare nanocrystal inks. In addition to 0-D nanocrystals,40–43 anisotropic 1-D and 2-D crystals in the forms of CuInSe2 nanowires,240 CuInSe2 nanoplatelets,241 Cu2−xSySe1−y nanowires,242 CuIn1−xGaxS2 (CIGS) nanorods,243 and Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) nanorods244 have been synthesized by the solvothermal method in the presence of the corresponding organometal precursors. Fine control of the chemical composition of the nanocrystals is the pre-requisite for a high performance device. Grain growth of the nanocrystals into high quality large crystals without incorporation of micropores is another key factor. Agrawal and coworkers reported 5.5% efficiency using the CISe nanocrystal absorber layer after solid state densification of the layer during the selenization process.238 Very recently, the same group prepared a CIGS absorber layer film and partially exchanged the S anions with Se to form a CIGSSe layer. They reported 12% conversion efficiency by the process.237 Jeong et al. achieved 8.2% efficiency with a CISe nanocrystal layer followed by high temperature densification.239 In spite of the abrupt increase of the conversion efficiency, the chemical composition of ternary or quaternary MCs has yet to be controlled. And the effect of the nanocrystal shape has not been studied. Regarding the densification of the nanocrystal layer, in situ self-assembly of the 1-D or 2-D nanocrystals into superstructures during the coating process may facilitate the formation of a non-porous crystal layer. The organic surfactants obstruct densification of the nanocrystals and the vapors cause elemental contamination which is not controlled. The synthesis of surfactant-free multicomponent nanocrystals is in great requirement.245
Conjugated polymer–MC bulk heterojunction hybrid solar cells have been actively prepared during the last ten years.246–248 These hybrid systems take advantage of the flexible nature of polymers and the wider light absorption of inorganic materials than organic materials. Most polymer-based hybrid solar cells consist of an interpenetrated network of electron donor and acceptor phases with bulk heterojunction interfaces. Alivisatos and co-workers first demonstrated a CdSe nanorod/poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) hybrid solar cell created by spin casting a solution of CdSe nanorods in P3HT.249 Because CdSe and P3HT exhibit complementary absorption spectra in the visible spectrum, devices composed of blended nanorod–polymer materials have a wide photocurrent spectrum from UV to 720 nm. A power conversion efficiency of 1.7% was obtained. Since then, conversion efficiency has been steadily increased by adding additives to enhance the crystallinity of P3HT250 or using different conjugated polymers.251,252 Conjugated polymers used widely in hybrid solar cells have relatively large band gaps (∼1.9 eV), which limit absorption of the low energy solar spectrum from red to NIR. Low band gap polymers are promising candidates as organic components for efficient light harvesting. Recently, CdSe tetrapods were combined with a low bandgap polymer (PCPDTBT), resulting in a power conversion efficiency of 3.13% under AM 1.5 illumination (Fig. 13).253 MC nanocrystals have also been used as light-absorbing sensitizers in organic–TiO2 heterojunction hybrid solar cells. Although the performance of these solid-state DSSCs is lower than that of liquid-electrolyte-based DSSCs, the recent progress reported by Gratzel and coworkers is promising. This group generated Sb2S3 nanoparticles on a porous TiO2 layer by chemical bath deposition, and then the pores were filled with P3HT by spin-coating.254 The resultant hybrid cell showed a high conversion efficiency (η = 5.13%) and highly stable photovoltaic performance in air without sealing the cell. Seok and coworkers further investigated the same system to find the best conducting polymer for hole injection from the Sb2S3 sensitizer nanocrystals. They achieved η = 6.18% at 1.5 AM 1.5 G radiation.255 So far, spherical quantum dot sensitizers have been used attached to the surfaces of the porous metal oxide network. Anisotropic MCs such as nanorods and nanoplates deserve thorough investigation for the hole injection and chemical correlation with the polymer layer.

5.5. Other potential applications
Besides the aforementioned applications, the solution-based MC nanocrystals have recently been investigated as potential materials for localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and oxygen reduction. The topological insulating property and superconductivity of layer-structured MCs are now actively considered in physical studies. Although most current studies have been conducted with MCs prepared through the vacuum processes, a solution-based approach is still advantageous in producing copious amounts and in structural control.
Surface plasmon is a light wave that evolves as a result of resonant interactions between the electromagnetic field of incident light and the plasma of electrons confined in restricted dimensions. Plasmons confined in nano-sized dimensions oscillate locally with a frequency known as the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). The intensity and frequency of surface plasmon absorption bands are highly dependent on the characteristics of the material, such as the material species, size, shape, and additives on the surface.256 Resonant waves are sensitive to the dielectric properties of the surrounding and can be tuned by external electromagnetic waves,257 which enables the surface plasmon to be utilized for sensing,258 imaging,259 information processing,260 and optoelectronic purposes.261 LSPRs have been extensively characterized with metal nanoparticles (Au, Ag, Pt, Cu etc.). Semiconductors have an additional control variable in LSPR, which is tunability of the carrier concentration by doping. Copper chalcogenide nanocrystals are the species studied the most so far.262–265 When Cu is slightly deficient with respect to S or Se, the nanocrystals contain a large number of free hole carriers in the valence band. The LSPR bands of CuS nanoparticles blue-shifted as the dopant concentration was increased. Recently, the effects of morphology on the LSPR response has been investigated in a Cu2−xS nanodisk system.37 In-plane and out-of-plane dipolar resonances were determined. The wavelengths, line shapes, and relative intensities of these plasmon bands were tuned by controlling the geometric aspect ratio of the disk or free carrier densities.
Most research on the cathodes of fuel cells has focused on Pt-based materials because of their excellent electrocatalytic performance. However, Pt-based materials show severe Pt-dependence,266 the kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are slow,267 and there is CO deactivation.268 Various MCs are considered promising Pt-free ORR electrocatalysts because of their low cost, high tolerance to methanol and halide ions, and simple solution-based synthetic approach.269 For example, CoSe2–DETA (DETA = diethylenetriamine) hybrid nanobelts show good electrocatalytic performance with respect to ORR (onset potential of ca. 0.71 V) in acidic media. This good performance is ascribed to the large specific surface area and well-defined layered structure of CoSe2–DETA constructed with small DETA molecules.270 Long-term stability of the CoSe2–DETA still needs to be addressed before these can be used practically.270 The properties of MC cathodes can be improved by introducing other nanoparticles. For example, adding Fe3O4 nanoparticles to the CoSe2 hybrid nanobelt catalyst resulted in an increase of onset potential and current density.270 Although the electrocatalytic activity of this catalyst is still lower than that of Pt-based catalysts, these hybrid MC systems deserve further investigation.
A topological insulator is an unconventional quantum phase of semiconducting or insulating matter that possesses a metallic conductivity on its surface.271–273 Surface electronic states are spin polarized and protected by time-reversal symmetry. Significant efforts have been devoted to investigate the potential application of topological insulators in spintronics and quantum information processing.274,275 The number of publications on the layered MC materials, mainly V–VI (V = Bi, Sb; VI = Se, Te), has been increasing dramatically since this family of compounds was predicted to be three-dimensional topological insulators with unique surface states composed of a single Dirac cone at the Γ point.276–279 Currently, most studies on topological insulators have been conducted with chalcogenides obtained through vapor-phase synthesis. Fine control of the thickness, defects, and atomic states at the surfaces are challenging issues. And the synthesis of wide 2-D MC nanosheets (larger than at least a few micrometers) should be synthesized in a highly reproducible manner. And, the organic surfactants are serious obstacles to the solution-based MC nanocrystals in this area. Surfactant-free or inorganic surfactant systems during the preparation of MC nanocrystals create the clean surface and cause the negligible change of the surface electronic state. Solving these issues of synthesis is expected to draw attention in MC-based transistors.
Some MCs have recently emerged as a new class of superconductors that are electrically conductive without resistance below a certain temperature.280–282 Iron chalcogenides (FeSe, FeTe) with a layered structure are considered high-superconducting transition temperature (Tc) superconductors.283 In addition, unconventional superconducting states are expected from the interaction between magnetism and superconductivity. Iron selenide (FeSe) has shown superconducting properties with a Tc of 8 K.284 The Tc of FeSe is improved up to ∼14 K by doping Te285 and to over 30 K under high pressure with a dTc/dP rate of ∼9.1 K Gpa−1.286 Sulfur-doped FeSe1−xSx systems (x = 0.2) have a Tc of 15.5 K.287 Superconductivity above 30 K was recently reported for K0.8Fe2Se2 due to alkali intercalation between the FeSe layers.288 Despite recent advances in iron-based superconductors, their chemical complexity, local structure, and the relationship between magnetism and superconductivity need to be understood to clarify the mechanism.289 Unfortunately, no MCs synthesized by a solution approach have been reported to possess superconductivity. We attribute this to the difficulty in fine control of the chemical composition, defects, and surface states in solution-based approaches. It is a challenging subject to realize the superconductivity in the materials synthesized in a solution.
6. Challenges
This review summarized four different approaches to synthesize anisotropic MC nanocrystals: intrinsic growth into a 1-D or 2-D nanostructure, crystal growth in organic templates, oriented attachment, and chemical transformation. A number of challenges should be addressed in the solution-based synthesis of the anisotropic MC nanocrystals to realize practical applications in industry. The challenges include (1) understanding of the surface energy decrease by surfactants, (2) adopting chemical transformations in the nucleation and growth of MC nanocrystals, (3) removal of organic surfactants, (4) kinetic study on the chemical transformation, (5) scale-up of production to meet the industrial needs, and (6) eco-friendly synthesis.
In the synthesis utilizing organic surfactants, the decrease in surface energy depends on the number of binding sites and the binding energy between the surfactant molecules and the inorganic surfaces. Binding exclusively to a specific surface can facilitate the oriented attachment to form nanowires or nanoplates, but binding to all the surfaces helps self-assembly of the nanocrystals into superstructures. In the layer-structured materials, the number of crystal surfaces exposed to the solution is limited (typically 2 surfaces) and the surfactant molecules adsorb on the top and bottom surfaces without binding to the side surface. The small flat nanocrystals go through the oriented attachment side-by-side and form larger nanoplates or nanosheets; hence oriented attachment in 2-D structures is natural as seen in many recent publications.136,158,161 In contrast, the oriented attachment for generating 1-D nanomaterials requests delicate control of binding of surfactant molecules. The small building block nanocrystals to be used for this oriented attachment may be isotropic or show small deviation from an isotropic shape. The number of surfaces of those nanocrystals is large and the atomic composition of the surfaces is not simple. To succeed in exclusive binding of surfactant molecules to a specific surface of the building block nanocrystals, we need precise quantitative information on the binding energy and the resulting surface energy decrease. Unfortunately, the information is yet to be understood because the binding is affected by as many reaction conditions as surfactant molecules, MC crystal structures, precursors, solvents, temperature, pH, etc. An additional issue regarding the surfactant is the assembly of the building block nanocrystals that are driven by interactions between the surfactant molecules. These surfactant interactions may induce self-assembly of the building blocks to form superstructures or cause the formation of templates such as micelles or vesicles consisting of the surfactant molecules and the MC elements. Currently, it is not clear which molecules can exist as the organometal complex and form such templates during the synthesis. Several anisotropic MCs have been prepared by the template-based synthesis, but the physics on the formation of such templates needs thorough investigation. The physics is more complicated than the micelle formation of pure organic molecules because the interaction between the inorganic elements incorporated in the organic molecules should be taken into consideration in the assembly of the complex molecules.
Another challenge in the synthesis of anisotropic MC nanocrystals is the lack of knowledge on how the chemical composition of the nanocrystals is determined. The theory of conventional nucleation and growth in a solution phase has been established under the assumption of stoichiometric supply of elemental sources. The concentration of a source element is determined by the reduction rate of the precursor. Finding synthesis conditions under which the reduction rates of the source molecules are the same is critical in the nanocrystal synthesis. It is not certain whether the elemental composition of a product nanocrystal is identical to the elemental concentration of the sources in the nucleation and growth steps. Because the equilibrium constants of the precursors are different and vary during the synthesis, it is almost impossible to maintain the stoichiometric concentration of the source elements. This hypothesis leads to the existence of chemical transformation taking place during the nanocrystal synthesis. In the MC nanocrystals, the in situ chemical transformation is the alloy formation.163 Taking an example of CdSe quantum dots, the nuclei might be Cd-rich or Se-rich or even pure Cd or Se, and then the other element forms alloy nanocrystals with the stoichiometric composition of 1:1. The alloy formation is spontaneous because the alloy composition is thermodynamically more stable. As long as initial nuclei do not grow into an anisotropic structure, the overall shape of the final product will be 0-D and the precise facets will be determined by surface energy of the nanocrystal. Hence, the shape of 0-D nanocrystals is not very sensitive to reaction temperature. In the anisotropic MC nanocrystals, however, the fast anisotropic growth of one component can result in a completely different shape of the final product although the chemical compositions of the nanocrystals are identical. For example, The shape of Bi2Te3 is strongly dependent on the reaction temperature, typically varying from 2-D nanoplates at high temperatures (∼200 °C) to nanowires with lots of nanoplates growing in the radial direction at lower temperatures (∼150 °C), or to nanowires with multiple grains at much lower temperatures (∼100 °C).290 At the high temperatures, the elemental fraction of the reduced Bi and Te is considered similar to 2:3; hence the stable stoichiometric 2-D nanoplates could be nucleated and grown. At the low temperatures, Te grows first into the nanorods or nanowires because of its intrinsic preference to a 1-D structure, and then they are transformed into Bi2Te3. The shape of the final product should depend on the length of pure Te nanowires before Bi starts forming the alloy. This result is an example showing the importance of understanding the reaction kinetics in the shape control of anisotropic nanocrystals. Unfortunately, the kinetics has not been studied thoroughly. For the ternary or quaternary nanocrystals, monitoring the reaction kinetics is a very difficult task at the current stage. Data on the basis of the reduction rate of the precursors under a variety of solution conditions should be accumulated by both experimental and theoretical studies.
Surfactants are critical in preparation of stable colloidal suspensions and in the shape control of MC nanocrystals. However, the organic surfactants are problematic in practical uses. Many applications involve sintering of the MC nanocrystal films which aims at preparation of nanograined composites (thermoelectric devices) or simply at solution processing for cost-effective device fabrication (CI(G)S solar cell). The insulating organic layer functions as a barrier for charge injection and diminishes the expected properties from the pure MCs. The surfactant molecules change the surface electronic state of the individual MC nanocrystals; hence studies on the topological insulator and the high-mobility semiconductor have been conducted with the MC films obtained by the dry-processes. Nanocrystal thick films often exhibit weak mechanical strength caused by the low material density and micropores generated during the sintering of the nanocrystal films. The problem regarding the use of surfactants can be tackled by the synthesis of surfactant-free nanocrystals, ligand exchange by volatile organic molecules, or the use of inorganic surfactants. The surfactant-free synthesis is promising for the 2-D MC nanocrystals because their basal surfaces are covered with chalcogen atoms. The slightly negative charge of the chalcogen atoms can provide colloidal stability to the nanocrystals. Although the stability without a surfactant is limited, the nanoplates can be redispersed in the solution by simple ultrasonication and formulated into nanocrystal inks. If the application is to produce thick films of MC crystals through thermal treatment, a slurry-like ink is useful for the coating process. When the long-term stability is critical, the organic surfactant can be replaced by volatile molecules before being used. Employing inorganic ligands appears promising because such surfactants do not form the insulating barrier layer on the nanocrystal surfaces. The approach allows low-temperature thermal annealing which facilitates fabrication of flexible devices on polymer substrates. Furthermore, the inorganic surfactants are expected to maintain the high charge mobility and topological insulating nature of the 2-D MC nanocrystals. Recently, molecular metal chalcogenide complexes (MCCs) based on a Sn or Cu metal element have been successfully employed as the inorganic surfactants.144,145 The other MCCs should be developed for diverse MC compositions.
The nanocrystals can be used as templates that can be chemically transformed into diverse anisotropic nanocrystals. However, thermodynamic aspects and the reaction kinetics of the chemical transformation are not well established yet. Solubility products of the reactant and the product MC nanocrystals are considered to determine whether the reaction can proceed or not. When the product nanocrystal has a lower solubility in the solution than that of the reactant nanocrystal, the reaction takes place spontaneously. Otherwise, the chemical transformation requests addition of organic molecules which bind selectively to one element of the initial nanocrystal so that the solubility product of the initial nanocrystal can be increased. So far, the solubility products of MC materials are rarely obtainable under most solution conditions. And, the binding energy between organic molecules and inorganic elements has not been tabulated thoroughly; hence selective bindings to adjust the solubility are not available in the database. The chemical transformation involves material diffusion, rearrangement of crystal structure, and accumulation of mechanical stress. The reaction kinetics and mechanism to preserve the single crystallinity during the transformation should be explored further to study the crystal structure of the product nanocrystals.
Precise shape control and heterostructure design are the main advantages of the solution-based synthesis. When it comes to the amount of production, mechanical milling of bulk MCs into a fine powder is more profitable in terms of cost. Because most applications of the anisotropic MC nanocrystals use thick films sintered at high temperatures, the gram scale production is not sufficient. For example, one pellet specimen for thermoelectric test requests about 0.5 g of nanocrystals. The CIGS solar module or a set of LIB coin cell electrodes also need similar amount for each test. Recently, a few groups demonstrated a high yield synthesis in the scale of about 1.4 g per 180 ml.137 The synthesis should be scaled up to kg production per batch for industrial use. Obstacles to achieve the massive production are the relatively low solubility of the MC precursors, pressure build-up by the gaseous by-products during the synthesis, and inhomogeneous mixing in large scale reactors which is problematic in fast reaction systems. Continuous-flow reaction systems can be an alternative way to the batch systems. Fast mixing, easy temperature control, and small amount consumption of reagents are advantageous over the batch-type reaction. Recently, Seeberger and coworkers demonstrated a microfluidic system to produce isotropic quantum dots.291 Jeon and coworkers reported the synthesis of E-mail: ZnSe@ZnS core–shell quantum dots in a microfluidic reaction system.292 Production of anisotropic nanomaterials has not been reported in the continuous reaction systems. Scale-up of the continuous-flow reaction and the parallel integration of the set-up may facilitate massive production to meet the industrial needs.
Nanocrystal inks are gaining tremendous attention to achieve a cost-effective coating process. Eco-friendly synthesis becomes important. Currently, MC nanocrystals are synthesized mainly by the solvothermal approach in which the reaction is conducted at a high temperature (typically around 200 °C) in organic solvents. The use of solvents with a high boiling temperature in the approach makes it difficult to recycle the solvents. Synthesis in water or volatile alcohols is desirable in terms of the environment friendliness. The reaction yield of 100% is also an important issue in the inorganic synthesis in order to prevent contamination by toxic elements. Especially the chemical transformation approach uses an excess amount of a source material for the exchange reaction when the transformation is not favored in energetically.162
