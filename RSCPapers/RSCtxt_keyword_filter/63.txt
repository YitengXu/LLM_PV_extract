    First published on 17th November 2021AbstractThe continued development of solar energy conversion technologies relies on an improved understanding of their limitations. In this review, we focus on a comparison of the charge carrier dynamics underlying the function of photovoltaic devices with those of both natural and artificial photosynthetic systems. The solar energy conversion efficiency is determined by the product of the rate of generation of high energy species (charges for solar cells, chemical fuels for photosynthesis) and the energy contained in these species. It is known that the underlying kinetics of the photophysical and charge transfer processes affect the production yield of high energy species. Comparatively little attention has been paid to how these kinetics are linked to the energy contained in the high energy species or the energy lost in driving the forward reactions. Here we review the operational parameters of both photovoltaic and photosynthetic systems to highlight the energy cost of extending the lifetime of charge carriers to levels that enable function. We show a strong correlation between the energy lost within the device and the necessary lifetime gain, even when considering natural photosynthesis alongside artificial systems. From consideration of experimental data across all these systems, the emprical energetic cost of each 10-fold increase in lifetime is 87 meV. This energetic cost of lifetime gain is approx. 50% greater than the 59 meV predicted from a simple kinetic model. Broadly speaking, photovoltaic devices show smaller energy losses compared to photosynthetic devices due to the smaller lifetime gains needed. This is because of faster charge extraction processes in photovoltaic devices compared to the complex multi-electron, multi-proton redox reactions that produce fuels in photosynthetic devices. The result is that in photosynthetic systems, larger energetic costs are paid to overcome unfavorable kinetic competition between the excited state lifetime and the rate of interfacial reactions. We apply this framework to leading examples of photovoltaic and photosynthetic devices to identify kinetic sources of energy loss and identify possible strategies to reduce this energy loss. The kinetic and energetic analyses undertaken are applicable to both photovoltaic and photosynthetic systems allowing for a holistic comparison of both types of solar energy conversion approaches.

1. Introduction
As humankind's impact on the environment continues to be topical, there is little doubt that future energy demand will be met, at least in part if not largely, by solar energy. To mitigate anthropological climate change and ensure a liveable future, we need to eliminate our dependence on fossil fuels with finite reserves. Accordingly, governments at various levels have pledged to reach 100% renewable energy by 2050,1,2 and are looking toward solar energy as its vast potential is too great to disregard.3,4 The decreasing costs of established technologies such as silicon photovoltaics (PV) has translated into significant worldwide adoption of solar energy conversion technology. Cost reductions since the 1980's have been mainly driven by improvement in efficiencies supported by sustained research and development and more recently by economies of scale.5 A number of technologies are emerging that compliment Si PV and have desirable properties in certain market applications. These include printed PV cells for integration into built environment and photosynthetic (PS) systems to enable solar energy storage in chemical bonds through the synthesis of sustainable fuels. Cost reductions, related to efficiency and stability enhancements, are needed for many of these technologies to become commercially viable. Increased understanding of the factors limiting device performance is a key enabler to address these challenges and accelerate the adoption of these low-carbon energy technologies to decarbonize our energy system.6
A challenge that most solar energy conversion technologies face is making use of short-lived photoexcited states. Decay to the ground state, typically by recombination or fluorescence, generally takes place on timescales of picoseconds to a few microseconds, depending on the material used. In contrast, the desired function (charge collection to electrodes in PV, formation of chemical bonds in PS) requires much longer-lived excited states, often on the many microseconds to hundreds of milliseconds timescale. The mismatch in timescales drives much of the research dedicated to solar energy conversion. Critically, improvement of the performance of many solar energy conversion technologies depends on knowledge of the charge carrier dynamics. Such information can enable focus to be placed on the most limiting processes, leading to the most impactful improvements.
Many methods can be employed to determine the timescales of key processes such as charge separation and charge recombination in solar energy conversion devices.7,8 These include transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS),9 time-resolved photoluminescence (tr-PL),10 electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS),11 transient and charge extraction measurements,12 time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC),13 and Terahertz spectroscopy.14 Using these techniques, many studies have investigated the lifetimes of photogenerated charges and the charge transfer kinetics. The fastest possible charge separation kinetics are all too often regarded as desirable for efficient performance. However, the energetic costs associated with such rapid charge transfers have received comparatively much less attention, even though these will adversely affect the overall solar energy conversion efficiency.15
As an example, we can point to the realization that achieving the fastest electron injection kinetics in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs; i.e., electron transfer from a light harvesting dye to its TiO2 scaffold) does not necessarily lead to improved cell performance. Lengthening the timescale, equivalent to reducing the rate constant, of electron injection can improve device efficiency if there is a related slowdown of recombination processes, as is often seen.16,17 It has been correctly pointed out that it is not the rate constant of electron injection which affects device performance, but it is rather the rate of electron transfer determined by kinetic competition with, for example, relaxation which is the key parameter.18 Optimized devices are expected to have sufficiently fast forward kinetics to compete favourably with loss pathways and achieve high yields (∼>90%) without paying too severe of an energetic cost.19 We will expand on similar concepts to other PV and PS systems.
The kinetic analysis herein provides a complementary approach to evaluate the potential of solar energy conversion systems to the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) efficiency limit.15 Our analysis includes quantitative consideration of the impact of the charge carrier lifetime required to achieve efficient function, a factor not included in SQ analyses. As such, our analyses allow quantitative understanding of why it is easier to achieve high performance and approach the SQ limit of performance for some device classes than for others.
In this review, we discuss the correlations between charge carrier kinetics, energetics, and device efficiency for a range of solar conversion technologies. We focus on quantum approaches to solar energy conversion, specifically PV and PS, excluding solar thermal (readers are instead referred to recent reviews on this topic20–22), and comparisons with biological photosynthesis. Using high efficiency examples from the literature, we consider the balance of charge carrier lifetime gain vs. energetic cost needed for efficient solar energy conversion. We compare the energetic losses of different devices from the difference between the thermally relaxed excited state (e.g., the bandgap) and the energy extracted (VOC for PV, energy stored in a chemical fuel for PS). We review knowledge on kinetic competition in the context of solar energy conversion, keeping in mind the interplay between energetics and the efficiency of charge transfer reactions. Notably, PV and PS approaches are reviewed holistically. We discuss examples of strategies employed to mitigate detrimental recombination and the energetic costs associated with charge separation and increased lifetimes.
1.1 Solar energy conversion systems
We will compare two types of solar energy conversion systems: (1) PV systems that produce electricity and (2) PS systems that produce chemical fuels (i.e., solar fuels). The different types of systems discussed are summarized in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Different types of solar energy conversion devices and their operation. Section numbers are indicated near the top left of each class of device. Energies are denoted with E with different subscripts: F for the Fermi level, p for holes, n for electrons, ox for oxidation, * for the excited state, C for the conduction band, V for the valence band, med. for the redox mediator. VOC is the open circuit voltage, multiplied by the elementary charge q to convert to an energy. ΔGWS is the free energy change for the water splitting reaction. Abbreviations used: ITO = indium tin oxide, HTL = hole transport layer, D = donor, A = acceptor, ETL = electron transport layer, Sens. = sensitizer, Elec. = electrolyte, Cat. = catalyst, MO = metal oxide, Ex. = excitonic, N-Ex. = non-excitonic. 
For PV technologies, we will consider DSSCs (Section 5.1), organic photovoltaics (OPVs; Section 5.1), inorganic solar cells (Si, GaAs; Section 5.2) and perovskite solar cells (Section 5.2). We now briefly introduce these systems.

DSSCs. 
The multiple distinct kinetic competitions in these devices (charge transport vs. interfacial recombination) make them a good starting point to outline energetic cost examples. The many studies of kinetics in DSSCs have produced a rich body of examples. We will focus on the kinetics and energetics of two kinetic competitions: (1) electron injection vs. dye relaxation, (2) dye regeneration by the redox mediator vs. interfacial recombination with TiO2 electrons.


OPVs. 
Charge generation in OPVs is dictated by exciton separation at the donor/acceptor interface. Recombination in the active layer is of importance as it typically limits device efficiency. We will focus on the kinetics of charge separation and recombination in the donor/acceptor blend and how the energetics are influenced by energy levels and disorder.


Inorganic solar cells. 
Si solar cells are the most successful commercial solar cells and their design and fabrication have been optimized over the past few decades. State-of-the-art inorganic solar cells tend to show performance closest to theoretical maxima. We look at these for examples of the lowest energetic costs achieved in practice.


Perovskite solar cells. 
Organohalide perovskites were first discovered as active layer components in liquid DSSCs. Their architecture has since evolved to resemble solid-state DSSCs or thin film inorganic solar cells. Their efficiencies have dramatically improved over a short number of years and have surpassed those of multicrystalline Si solar cells in the lab. We will focus on how the scaffold material impacts the energetics as well as the link between surface passivation and voltage output.
For PS, we will consider molecular donor–acceptor assemblies (Section 5.3), dye-sensitized photo(electro)chemical cells (Section 5.3), metal oxide photoelectrodes (Section 5.4), and particulate photocatalysts (Section 5.5). We note the distinction between the term photosynthesis, describing an energetically uphill reaction, and the term photocatalysis, describing an energetically downhill reaction.23 We focus on PS systems since only they have a positive energy output but will mention some photocatalytic systems of interest. The systems are briefly described below.


Molecular donor–acceptor assemblies. 
Molecular assemblies with well-defined structures have proved to be very valuable to develop our understanding of charge transfer kinetics. Precise energetic and distance modifications have helped quantify the factors that influence charge transfer kinetics and devise working models. We will focus on understanding these results in the framework of Marcus theory and look at the energetics/kinetics trade-off of intersystem crossing to the triplet state.


Dye-sensitized photo(electro)synthetic cells. 
These devices are the PS analogues of DSSCs. Many of the kinetic processes are similar to DSSCs, with the important exception of the interfacial redox reaction. We will focus on how the increased timescale of charge extraction increases the sensitivity to recombination on millisecond timescales and the influence of trap states.


Metal oxide photoelectrodes. 
Photoanodes made from transition metal oxides (e.g., hematite, BiVO4, WO3) is one of the most promising approaches to solar-driven water splitting. The use of an external bias allows for precise tuning of the Fermi level in the semiconductors. We will focus on how the changes in electron occupancy and the formation of a space charge layer affects charge recombination.


Particulate photocatalysts. 
The simplicity of the system design does not translate to a simple picture of the charge carrier dynamics. The heterogeneity of the samples and the lack of external electrical connections make for challenging experimental conditions. A clear distinction between excitonic and non-excitonic systems is not always made. We will look at emerging studies of the charge carrier dynamics in benchmark systems, where charge trapping has been seen to play a key role.

1.2 Considerations for comparison of PV and PS systems
The end products of PV (electricity) and PS (molecules) devices are quite different. In their function, we can distinguish the two types of systems by the charge extraction step (Fig. 2):24 collection of charges at opposite electrodes for PV, and the interfacial charge transfer to the electrolyte of at least one type of charge carrier for PS. To calculate and compare the energy losses for different systems, we take the VOC of PV and the free energy stored in the chemical fuel produced by photocatalysts as the extracted energies. In the cases where an external applied bias is required (i.e., photoelectrodes), the extracted energy is taken as equivalent to the apparent photovoltage from the difference between the onset potential and the formal redox potential of the light-driven reaction.

We also distinguish different technologies as excitonic or non-excitonic by the mechanism of initial charge separation. On the one hand, systems where the light absorber has a small dielectric constant (e.g., conjugated polymers in OPVs, dye molecules in DSSCs) produce small, localized Frenkel-type excitons. The energy required to separate the bound exciton into dissociated free charges (named the exciton binding energy) is larger than the available thermal energy and separation is not spontaneous. Typically, an interfacial energy offset is used to drive charge separation. ‘Excitonic’ systems refer to technologies with molecular/polymeric absorbers, such as OPVs, DSSCs, as well as biological photosynthesis. On the other hand, for semiconductors with large dielectric constants and correspondingly small exciton binding energies, dissociated charges are typically the first excited state of significance. The free electrons and holes are then directed toward the appropriate interfaces by asymmetric conductivities25 or internal electric fields.26 ‘Non-excitonic’ systems refers to technologies typically using inorganic semiconductors such as Si solar cells and metal oxide photocatalysts.
We note that there can be different measures of efficiency for different solar energy conversion approaches. The performance of a PV cell can be evaluated in terms of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and the incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) or external quantum efficiency (EQE) which highlight their wavelength dependence. For PS solar fuel producing systems, the solar-to-fuel (STF) or solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiencies are similar to the PCE for PV systems. In the specific case of photoelectrodes, the applied-bias photon-to-current (ABPC) metric accounts for the electrical energy input to calculate the energy gained. To ensure insightful comparisons of the energetics between different types and classes of devices, we have chosen examples that show high overall performance (PCE, STF/STH, or ABPC as appropriate) in their respective category under standard AM1.5G sunlight.
2. Energetics and kinetics in natural photosynthesis
It is insightful to take natural photosynthesis as a benchmark example. While there exists a wide range of photosynthetic systems developed by nature, reflecting environmental diversity, the fundamental steps of light absorption, charge separation, and charge extraction remain constant.27,28 Sunlight harvested by antenna complexes drives charge separation across a biological membrane to satisfy the energetic requirements of water oxidation, NADP+ reduction, and ATP production. The light harvesting antenna systems in higher plants transfer the molecular excited states (primarily chlorophyll singlet excited states) generated by the absorption of sunlight to the reaction centres of photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII). The pigments, mainly consisting of chlorophylls, and their arrangement have evolved to give a broad absorption in the visible range. The energy stored in the primary reaction centre chlorophyll excited state is 1.77 eV (700 nm) and 1.81 eV (684 nm) for PSI and PSII, respectively.29
The charge carrier dynamics of PSI and PSII have been extensively reviewed.30–35 To briefly summarize, in PSI the absorbed energy is funnelled to the special pair P700 (since it absorbs at 700 nm), a chlorophyll heterodimer. The P700* excited state is the primary electron donor to the modified chlorophyll A0 (standing for acceptor 0), generating the first charge separated state within a few ps. The excited electron subsequently transfers to a phylloquinone (A1; charge transfer lifetime ∼30 ps), then to a series of iron sulfur clusters (Fx, Fa, then Fb; 20–500 ns). The characteristic lifetime of the radical pairs P700+–A0−, P700+–A1−, P700+–Fx− and P+–Fa/b− are respectively tens of ns, 10–250 μs, ∼1 ms, ∼40 ms, increasing as the excited electron is transferred further away from P+. The characteristic timescales of forward and backward electron transfers are summarized in Fig. 3.36 The initial excited state lifetime, typical of chlorophylls, is on the order of 4 ns.37–39 Remarkably, charge separation and the subsequent chain of electron transfer increases the excited state lifetime by about 7 orders of magnitude.

Distances between charge transfer reaction partners are indicated in blue. Reproduced from ref. 36 with permission from Elsevier, copyright 2017. 
Similarly, in PSII the initial excited state resides on P680 and subsequent electron transfers form species such as P680+–Pheo− and P680+–QA− (where Pheo is pheophytin and QA is Quinone A). Additionally, a hole transfer pathway takes the hole from P680+ to the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) on nanosecond to microsecond timescales, through a tyrosine intermediate. The electron and hole are being driven apart through two different pathways resulting in a plethora of different recombination partners and complex equilibria are established at several points. Nevertheless, is it clear that the charge separated lifetimes are again many orders of magnitude longer than the initial 4 ns chlorophyll excited state. For example, P680+–Pheo− and P680+–QA− have direct recombination lifetimes of ∼30 ns and 2 ms.40,41 Ultimately, in PSI and PSII, a series of electron transfers take place to convert the high-energy, short-lived chlorophyll singlet state to lower-energy charge separated states with longer lifetimes (Fig. 4).
 Fig. 4  Relationship between energy and lifetime in PSI and PSII. Excited state energies are taken from ref. 29, and lifetimes from ref. 30–35. Colormap shows the percentage of energy stored compared to the two-state equilibrium limit with a starting point of 1.8 eV of stored energy and an initial lifetime of 4 ns. Lifetime enhancement is relative this 4 ns initial lifetime for chlorophyll. 
Considering the idealised single step charge separation pathway described above, we can evaluate how energetically efficient is charge separation in PSI and PSII. As detailed in Section 3 below, the minimum energetic difference that yields a 106 increase in lifetime is 59.2 meV × log(106) = 355 meV at room temperature. Combined with a representative energy input for the photosystems of 1.80 eV, the resulting ideal two-state energy stored in the long-lifetime state is about 1.45 eV (retaining 81% of the 1.80 eV input). In PSI, 1.05 eV (58% energetic efficiency) is stored in the long-lived P700+–Fa/b−, whereas in PSII the P680+–QA− state stores 1.28 eV (71% energetic efficiency), as illustrated in Fig. 4. The similarities in the positions of the different PSI and PSII states on Fig. 4 highlight that both photosystems pay similar energetic costs to achieve longer lifetimes despite having different electron transfer chains and suggests some generality in the relationship between energetic cost and lifetime enhancement. Considering the complete photosynthetic cycle lowers the energy stored to ∼0.8 eV per photon42,43 (44% energetic efficiency, neglecting proton pumping), likely a result of operating within real world constraints (e.g., energy dispersion, side reactions, regulation pathways), minimizing thermal back reactions and driving multiple high yielding charge transfer steps. The overall energetic efficiency of PSII is on the order of 50% when considering the reaction center chemistry and ATP production.44 Taken together, charge transfer chains of photosystems typically operate in the range of 40–70% energetic efficiency.44 With dedicated efforts, artificial solar energy conversion devices aim to reach and surpass the energetic efficiency of natural photosystems, which have inherent structural, environmental and stability limitations.43,45
3. Kinetic competitions and equilibria
3.1 Two excited state equilibrium
The efficiency of solar energy conversion is dictated by the kinetic competitions of forward and backward reactions taking place within the light absorber and at the various material interfaces. Following light absorption and the generation of the primary excited state, we may divide the key charge carrier dynamics into 3 productive steps: (1) charge separation, (2) charge transport, (3) charge extraction. To achieve an optimal efficiency, these steps must proceed with yields as close to 100% as possible. The yield of each step is determined by the kinetics of the productive (forward) and the unproductive (backward) processes. The faster the productive step is in comparison to the unproductive step, the higher the yield. In all cases, the productive step competes with relaxation processes, typically charge recombination or exciton decay, which return the system to its ground state. Microscopic reversibility and detailed balance imply that the forward and reverse reactions also compete. The resulting cyclic system of reactions is shown in Scheme 1.
 Scheme 1  Reaction scheme depicting photoexcitation, charge separation, charge transport, interfacial charge transfer reaction as well as wasteful charge recombination pathways. 
With further details in the ESI† (Section S1), we consider a simple equilibrium between the non-separated (i.e., excitonic) and charge separated excited states (Scheme 2) and assume first order kinetics. The kinetics and energetics of the system are linked by: (1)kCS is the forward rate constant of charge separation, k−CS is the rate constant for the backward reaction, KCS is the resulting equilibrium constant, and ΔGCS is the free energy difference between the non-separated and charge separated excited states. In this simple system, we neglect exciton or charge recombination to the ground state.
 Scheme 2  Simple two excited-state equilibrium energy diagram that relate the energy difference between locally excited and charge separated states to the interconversion rate constants. 
We highlight two key features of this two-state system. Firstly, the charge separation yield increases with faster charge separation (i.e., larger kCS) or longer charge separated lifetime (i.e., smaller k−CS). To achieve >90% yield, the forward rate of reaction needs to be at least a factor of 10 faster than the competing rates, meaning that KCS needs to be >10 (see Fig. S1, ESI†). Secondly, for each order of magnitude increase in KCS, ΔGCS decreases by 59.2 meV at room temperature as determined from eqn (1). A decrease in ΔGCS increases the amount of energy stored in the charge separated state, but at the expense of a lower charge separation yield.
The interdependence of kinetics and energetics discussed above leads to an optimal value of KCS that maximizes energy conversion into a charge separated state, as shown in Fig. 5 for the simple two excited-state equilibrium illustrated in Scheme 2. Assuming an input photon energy of 1 eV, the energy converted into the charge separated state (product of the yield of charge separation and the energy stored in the separated state) increases with KCS for values <1. A maximum of 0.884 eV (88.4% energy conversion) is reached at KCS = 34.5. The energy conversion is limited by lower charge separation yields at lower values of KCS. Note that the optimal value of KCS depends on the energy input, tending toward higher values for larger energy inputs (KCS between 15 and 150 for input energies between 0.5 and 4 eV; Fig. S3, ESI†). Increasing KCS past the optimal value results in a decrease of the energy converted due to the increasing energetic loss driving the forward step without sufficient additional gains in yield. It stands to reason that making a forward reaction rate constant exceptionally large at the cost of a larger energetic loss will not lead to an optimized solar energy conversion system.
 Fig. 5  Plot showing the effective energy stored as a function of the equilibrium constant between charge separation and charge reassociation. 
3.2 Four-state system
Devices under operation will assuredly have some active recombination pathways. Proceeding with rate constants denoted kr, kr′, etc., these undesired processes can waste energy at any intermediary step shown in Scheme 1. Keeping the example of the charge separation step and the assumption of simple first order kinetics, we obtain a similar situation to the case without recombination. As before, a faster charge separation or slower deactivation of the charge separated state (now as the sum of k−CS and kr′) leads to a higher charge separation yield. We can better illustrate the added kinetic competition at play by writing: (2)to clearly separate the rate constant ratios of k−CS/kCS = KCS−1 and kr′/kCS. ΦCS is the charge separation yield. We show the dependence of the yield on the different rate constant ratios in Fig. S5 (ESI†). While it is evident that a faster rate of forward charge separation (kCS) is beneficial, the key consideration is not the absolute rate constant but rather the kinetic competition with competing pathways, that is, the reverse reaction (k−CS) and charge recombination (kr′).
It must be stressed that improving the ratio of productive to unproductive rates above ∼100 leads to negligible improvements in yields, a concept known as kinetic redundancy.46,47 In fact, favouring the forward rate to such an extent will typically hurt overall device function by over paying the necessary energetic cost (e.g., Fig. 5). This concept remains true when considering Marcus theory of electron transfer where increased thermodynamic driving force leads to faster charge transfer kinetics, but only to a certain extent.48 For systems with discrete energy levels, when driving forces become larger than the reorganization energy the rate of electron transfer decreases, a concept known as the Marcus inverted region. When semiconductors, such as metal oxides, are involved in the electron transfer, the rate of electron transfer tends to plateau in the inverted region as the rate is the sum of the contributions to each energy in the continuum of states in the semiconductor.49 As a result, the yields for charge separation also tend to plateau with increasing driving force past the reorganization energy.
The kinetic schemes detailed so far are useful to introduce key kinetic competition concepts but are unlikely to describe operating experimental systems. We now consider the four-state model in Scheme 3 as a simplified kinetic scheme that captures the essential kinetic competitions in operating systems. The model is built from a fast thermal equilibrium between the initial excited state and the charge separated state. Recombination to the ground state (kr) is assumed to occur only from the non-separated state. An irreversible forward process necessary for function takes place from the charge separated state with rate constant kfunc.
 Scheme 3  Simple four-state energy diagram which captures the necessary function of a solar energy conversion system. 
The kinetic scheme shown in Scheme 3 and the resulting product ratios have been previously described in detail.50 Starting from a populated [D–A]* non-separated excited state, the terminal product ratio of ground state D–A to the charge extracted (CE) D+–A− state is given by: (3)Considering eqn (1), ΔGCS is related to the ratio kCS/k−CS. Combining with eqn (3), we arrive at: (4)
Converting to base 10 logarithms gives: (5)The raio kr/kfunc describes the kinetic competition between relaxation to the ground state and the functional energy extraction step. A key conclusion that emerges from eqn (4) and (5) is that variations in kr/kfunc will affect ΔGCS. Quantitatively, decreasing kr/kfunc by an order of magnitude to improve the kinetic competition is expected to cost 2.303kBT, that is 59.2 meV at room temperature. This is the same energetic cost for an order of magnitude change in rate constant ratios obtained from a simple two-state equilibrium described by eqn (1). In analogy to the concept shown in Fig. 5, there will be an optimal value of ΔGCS that will maximize the product of the charge extraction yield and the energy outputted. Keeping with the representative energy input of 1 eV, we obtain the plot shown in Fig. 6. The maximal output is typically reached at small thermodynamically favourable values of ΔGCS > −0.2 eV. Larger values of kr/kfunc decrease the maximal overall output and require a more negative ΔGCS to push the equilibrium farther toward the charge separated state and overcome the poor kinetic competition of the terminal reactions.
 Fig. 6  Product of the charge extraction yield and energy output for a four-state model as a function of ΔGCS and log(kr/kfunc). The energy input is taken as 1 eV. 
Negative ΔGCS amounts to a loss of energy compared to the high energy [D–A]* excited state. In this simplified system, we do not consider any other sources of energy loss. We can thus relate the ΔGCS derived here to the overall energy loss in the system, ΔGloss. Importantly, improving the kinetic competition by decreasing kr/kfunc to a point where a solar energy conversion system can function can be interpreted as the increasing the effective lifetime compared to the initial excited state lifetime that is given by 1/kr. With these considerations, we can write: ΔGloss ∝ 59.2 meV × log(necessary lifetime gain)(6)From eqn (6), we can state that each order of magnitude of necessary lifetime gain for function is expected to cost 59.2 meV, at room temperature. This will be used to benchmark reported experimental systems.
The strong dependence of solar energy conversion on the yield of productive steps and their energetic efficiency motivates the need to fully understand the kinetics and timescales of the forward and backwards reactions. Only with knowledge of the charge carrier dynamics can the main limitations be identified, and the competing kinetics optimized to reduce excessive energetic losses.
4. Relating the energetic losses to the charge carrier dynamics
In general, the charge carrier lifetime in a semiconductor is short compared to the charge transport or extraction processes (vide infra, Table 1). Solar energy conversion devices often introduce different materials or layers so that charges can flow where necessary to perform the desired function. This typically involves spatial separation of electrons and holes, making their encounter less likely. The result is a lower rate of recombination which leads to a beneficial longer charge carrier lifetime. A number of factors can impact the charge carrier lifetime,51 such as internal electric fields, space charge layers, interfacial states, thermodynamics of charge transfer, diffusion coefficients/charge mobility, defects, doping density, phonon coupling, spin dynamics. See Section S2 of the ESI† for a more detailed description of important considerations for the different charge carrier processes.

To gain a clearer understanding of the energetic costs needed to increase the charge carrier lifetime in real world devices, we tabulated key operational parameters52 of a wide range of published PV and PS systems (Table 1). Focus was placed on top performing devices that reported the desired parameters. Section 5 goes into further details for each device class, elaborating on the operational conditions and sources of energy losses.
The most striking feature revealed is the significant difference in the energetic losses of PV and PS devices: ΔGloss is on the order of 0.3–0.9 eV for PV and 1.3–1.8 eV for PS devices (Fig. 7). The origin of the ΔGloss losses, experimentally determined by comparing VOC to the absorber band gap, in different photovoltaic cells has been previously discussed by breaking down the total losses into their components (Fig. 8).53–55 The differences in radiative VOC losses (ΔVradOC; the difference between the Shockley–Queisser limit and the radiative limit which takes into account the device's emission energy) are striking. Inorganic solar cells typically have ΔVradOC on the order of 100 meV or less. Organic solar cells typically show high ΔVradOC > 200 meV due to the formation of emissive low-energy (compared to the band edge) charge transfer states which limits the VOC.54,56 We here take a different approach that can be applied to both PV and PS systems. From the link between kinetics and energetics developed in Section 3, we show that comparing the kinetic competition for the different classes of devices can shed light on the source of ΔGloss.
 Fig. 7  Comparison of the representative ΔGloss of different classes of solar energy conversion technologies as a function of (A) the typical charge residence time before extraction, (B) the necessary lifetime gain required for function, and (C) the logarithm of the necessary lifetime gain required for function. A linear trend with a slope of 86.8 meV is evident when comparing across different technologies. Only the best examples of metal oxides were included in the fit (greyed out red stars were excluded). The necessary lifetime gain is given by the ratio between the charge residence and relaxation lifetimes. Numeric labels refer to the entry numbers of Table 2.

(D) Analysis of the energetic losses in different types of photovoltaic cells. Open-circuit voltage losses are ΔVSQOC due to a nonideal short-circuit current density (green), ΔVradOC due to radiative losses from the lower luminescent energy compared to the band gap (red), and ΔVnonradOC due to nonradiative recombination. The SQ bandgap is indicated by a black line and the measured VOC as a blue bar. Reproduced from ref. 53 with permission from the American Physical Society, copyright 2017. 
Reviewing published operational parameters led us to identify a link between ΔGloss and the charge residence time, that is, the average time a charge remains in the device before extraction to the electrodes for PV or to the electrolyte for PS (Fig. 7A). The charge residence time of the carrier that remains in the device the longest is most important as this dictates the timescales where recombination will be kinetically competitive with the productive pathway. Similarly, a broad relationship between the PCE of thin film PV devices and the minority carrier lifetime has been reported (Fig. 9).58
 Fig. 9  Observed trends in thin film solar cell technology PCE as a function of the minority carrier lifetime (τ) and a unitless figure of merit . Reproduced from ref. 58 with permission of AIP Publishing, copyright 2016. 
We note that the charge residence times shown in Fig. 7A are dramatically different based on the type of device: on the order of microseconds–milliseconds for PV and approaching seconds for PS. The lengthening of the charge residence time over 9 orders of magnitude tends to increase ΔGloss.
To better compare the different classes of materials and devices, we normalize the charge residence time by the intrinsic relaxation lifetime to obtain the necessary lifetime gain for function. These values are obtained as described in Tables 1 and 2. The clear correlation between ΔGloss and the necessary lifetime gain is striking, as shown in Fig. 7B. Increasing the necessary lifetime gain over ∼14 orders of magnitude, going from high performance PV to PS devices, increases the ΔGloss from 0.3 eV to over 1.5 eV.

These simple observations summarise a key conclusion of our review: the low efficiency of PS compared to PV can be linked to the necessity for lifetime gains 3–6 orders of magnitude larger. We rationalize this observation by considering that the energetic penalty to sufficiently increase the charge carrier lifetime in PS devices results in a substantial decrease in solar energy conversion efficiency. A clear correlation is seen between the energetic losses and the increase in charge carrier lifetime necessary to match the charge extraction lifetime (Fig. 7C). A slope of 86.8 meV is extracted from the trend. This slope is about 50% larger than the 59.2 meV obtained from considering a simple four-state model (Section 3.2, eqn (6)). It appears that a great deal of the complex physics and chemistry in PV and PS systems can be approximated by the kinetic competition between charge extraction and charge recombination.
Within the PV class, we can distinguish technologies with demonstrated power conversion efficiencies (PCE) >20% (e.g., Si, GaAs, perovskites; Table 2, entries 7–11) to those with more modest PCEs ∼11–18% (OPV, DSSC; Table 2, entries 1–6). Unsurprisingly, the higher efficiency PV devices show lower energetic losses compared to their lower efficiency counterparts. It is interesting that the highest performing examples have necessary lifetime gains of 1 or lower (Table 1, entries 3–5). In other words, their intrinsic recombination lifetimes are sufficiently long to support efficient charge extraction without additional mechanisms such as large energy offsets to drive charge separation. This appears to be due to both short extraction times (∼microseconds instead of milliseconds) and long intrinsic charge carrier lifetimes (∼microseconds instead of nanoseconds), the ideal scenario. OPVs are an interesting case, where rapid charge extraction (microseconds or faster) is comparable to the high-performance PV devices. However, these are balanced by very short typical excitonic lifetime of a few hundreds of picoseconds to nanoseconds and result in a necessary lifetime gain of 102–103. The necessary lifetime gains appear to be linked to an increase in the energetic losses and a reduction in the obtainable PCE. As such it is apparent that for devices with relatively low required lifetime gains, it is easier to approach the SQ limit for device efficiency (Fig. 8). This analysis provides insight into how kinetic challenges can go beyond SQ considerations in limiting device performance.
We can separate the PS systems into 2 groups. The first are photoelectrodes (Table 2, entries 12–23), where an external bias is applied to generate strong band bending at the interface and a wide space charge layer (SCL). The energetic input increases charge separation and turns on the accumulation of long-lived charges involved in interfacial redox reactions. Here the extracted energy corresponds to the shift in onset potential for the catalytic reaction of interest, essentially a measure of the photovoltage generated by the photoelectrode. The metal oxide photoanodes, driving water oxidation, are grouped in the upper-right corner of Fig. 7A–C. The sluggish kinetics of water oxidation limit the reaction timescale to hundreds of milliseconds–seconds, in turn necessitating lifetime gains on the order of 109–1012. As a result of the kinetic challenge, the large ΔGloss > 1.3 eV imposes a severe limit on the solar energy conversion efficiency.
The second group are particulate photocatalysts (Table 2, entries 24–31) that have no electrical connections and perform PS without additional external inputs. In this case, the extracted energetic output will be dependent on the overall reaction being performed. For the common case of water splitting, 1.23 eV is extracted when water oxidation and proton reduction take place at the same pH. As the energy extracted is fixed by the reaction, the variations in ΔGloss reflect the differences in Eg. Wider bandgap materials (e.g., carbon nitride, CoO) show ΔGloss on the order of 1.4–1.5 eV and narrower bandgap materials (e.g., BiVO4:Mo/SrTiO3:La, Rh sheets59,60) have lower ΔGloss ∼ 1.1 eV. Unfortunately, the limited charge carrier dynamic studies of particulate photocatalysts prevents an in-depth discussion of the charge residence times and necessary lifetime gain for this class. Further insights in the correlation between lifetimes and energetic loss would increase our understanding of this potentially low-cost approach to solar fuels.
5. Relating energetics and kinetics in different classes of solar energy conversion devices
5.1 Excitonic photovoltaics
The large exciton binding energy >kbT of organic chromophores precludes the efficient generation of separated charges at room temperature. The photogeneration of charges from excitons thus requires an additional driving force typically provided by a donor–acceptor energetic offset (Fig. 10). This additional driving force contributes to the fact that excitonic photovoltaics show larger ΔGloss compared to devices with non-excitonic semiconductors that effectively generate separated charges directly. We note that the exciton binding energy doesn’t directly lead to a contribution to ΔGloss since the optical band gap will be reduced for larger exciton binding energy. Rather, the short lifetime of a bound exciton necessitates larger lifetime gains for function and leads to ΔGloss contributions through a potentially larger necessary donor–acceptor energy offset.

(b) The singlet donor exciton (blue) can form CT excitons and charge separated (CS) states (grey). Increasing DOS with energy in the CT–CS manifold is defined by the Coulomb potential (dashed curve) and represented by darkening greys. The red curves depict electron–phonon coupling. Reproduced from ref. 132. Copyright 2015 American Chemical Society. 
In addition, the recombination of charges at the donor–acceptor interface is typically non-radiative in nature, giving rise to large non-radiative losses. The energetic offset and morphology at this interface are critical for device function. We note that the separation of an exciton into two charges also results in an increase in entropy. The magnitude of this increase in entropy depends upon the densities (concentrations) of the resultant charges and is related to the difference in energy between the band edges and electron and hole quasi-Fermi levels. For example, in organic solar cells, the energy loss associated with this entropy increase has been estimated to be 100–200 meV.129,130

Dye-sensitized solar cells. 
In 1991 O’Regan and Grätzel developed a new type of solar cell based on dye-sensitized mesoporous TiO2 films – the DSSC.133 The DSSC is particularly interesting from a charge carrier dynamics point of view as it operates by a series of well-defined charge transfers (Fig. 11). These introduce several kinetic competitions when the cell is under operation, each with an associated energy loss at each step to drive the reactions forward (Fig. 12). We will focus on the major losses incurred to drive charge injection/separation at the dye–TiO2 interface (ΔGinjloss) and dye regeneration from a redox mediator (ΔGregloss).
 Fig. 11  Overview of processes taking place in a DSSC. Typical time constants are indicated for productive steps (green arrows) and recombination processes (red arrows) under 1 sun conditions for a Ru-based DSSC with I−/I3−. Reproduced from ref. 134. Copyright 2010 American Chemical Society. 
 Fig. 12  Approximate state energy diagram of a DSSC operating at the maximum power point under 1 sun illumination. Blue bars represent thermalization losses, red bars are the energy stored, and orange bars are the energies scaled by the cumulative quantum efficiency. For a typical DSSC with the N719 dye, this yields a PCE ∼ 9.5%. Reproduced with permission from ref. 135. Copyright 2009 American Chemical Society. 
In an efficient DSSC, we can expect injection yields >90% and regeneration yields >99% (higher to prevent dye degradation in the oxidized form). This is in line with IPCEs approaching 90% in top performing DSSCs.61,97,136–140 We thus require injection to outcompete relaxation by a factor of at least 10, and regeneration to outcompete TiO2(e−)–dye(h+) recombination by a factor of 100. This is indeed the case in DSSCs with top performance.138,141 Energetically, this puts minimum values of ΔGinjloss > 59 meV and ΔGregloss > 118 meV according to the relationship between energy loss and lifetime gain for a four-state system determined in Section 3.2.
The typical lifetime of an organic dye sensitizer is ∼1 ns,61 and charge transport in a DSSC (e.g., through the TiO2 layer) takes about 0.5 ms.12,62 An overall lifetime gain on the order of 106 is needed for DSSC function. Considering a four-state system, we estimate that ΔGloss will be at least 59.2 meV × log(106) = 355 meV. State-of-the-art DSSCs show ΔGloss experimental values ∼0.8 eV61,97,139,142 and are positioned near the natural PSII on Fig. 7C. In practice, the minimum driving forces for efficient injection is thought to be ∼200–300 meV.143,144 Regeneration also shows lower limits of ∼200–300 meV.145,146 Combined with intrinsic losses (Boltzmann, Carnot), we can expect a ΔGloss lower limit on the order of 0.5–0.6 eV and indicate that VOC increases of roughly 0.2 V should be possible for optimized DSSCs operating near thermodynamic and kinetic limits.
Various dye families have been tested as sensitizers for DSSCs: Ru-based dyes, porphyrins, carbazole, triphenylamine-based, indoline, amongst others.147–149 Ru-based dyes were the first to yield devices with PCE > 10%.147,150 Kinetic studies of DSSC with Ru dyes have laid the foundation of our understanding of kinetic competition in these systems. Key to the success of Ru dyes is the metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) character of the visible transition which increases spatial charge separation and reduces charge recombination. The photogenerated electron mainly localizes on a pyridine ligand while the hole remains on the Ru center.151,152 In the case of the N3 dye [Ru(dcbpy)2NCS2],153 the HOMO is delocalized onto the NCS groups, moving the hole toward the electrolyte to further reduce recombination and improve interaction with the redox mediator. Importantly, it has been shown that the unproductive back electron transfer shows a strong dependence on the distance between the TiO2 surface and the hole localized in the oxidized dye.154–156 For example, adding triphenylamine electron donors to the periphery of a Ru-based chromophore increased the electron–hole charge separation from 10 Å to 17 Å.155 The lifetime of the charge separated state was increased by 4 orders of magnitude, from 350 μs to 4 s. The strong influence of the electron–hole charge separation on the lifetime is shown in Fig. 13. Note the logarithmic y-axis.

Ru-based dyes typically show exceptionally fast electron injection dynamics into TiO2 on the sub-ps timescale down to ∼50 fs.157–159 While such fast electron injection guarantees high yields of electron injection, it is not necessarily beneficial to device performance. The strong electronic coupling required to achieve the fast rates will also accelerate back electron recombination.17,160–162 As such, only kinetic competition with relaxation to the ground state (lifetime up to 1 μs for the free dye) will impact DSSC performance. In fact, slowing down both electron injection and back electron recombination rates can result in improved performance due to better kinetic competitions.16,19,163 This is a striking example of the fact that there is little improvements in yield once the competing rate is faster by a factor of ∼100 (Fig. S1, ESI†). This is termed kinetic redundancy.46,47,164
More recently, PCE above 12% have been achieved with organic sensitizers,139,165–167 such as porphyrins61,138,162 and silyl anchor dyes.97,136,137 The success of these organic dyes lies in a detailed understanding of how the energetic and recombination losses can be overcome by two molecular engineering strategies. Firstly, long alkyl chains were added to the dye sensitizer to cover the TiO2 surface to reduce recombination with the electrolyte, particularly with Co- or Cu-based mediators.168,169 Secondly, the design of donor–π-bridge–acceptor dyes enabled long charge separated state lifetimes without compromising electron injection efficiency. Adding ancillary electron donating groups such as triphenylamine155,168 or carbazole170 increases the distance between electrons in TiO2 and the hole localized on the dye, limiting recombination.
For many years the I−/I3− redox couple remained the redox mediator of choice before the development of dyes compatible with Cu- or Co-based mediators.169 The success of the I−/I3− couple stems from a slow reduction of I2 and I3− by TiO2 electrons which reduces the rate of charge recombination.171–174 However, the energetic losses of the I−/I3− couple are large, explained by the complex redox processes at play. The I−/I3− redox potential is relatively negative (E0 ∼ +0.29 V vs. NHE in acetonitrile)172 which limits the VOC to about 0.8 V when using anatase TiO2 (CB edge ∼ −0.5 V vs. NHE).175 In addition, dye regeneration can proceed via a dye-I− complex176 and generates I2−.177 The redox potential of I−/I2− is ∼500–600 mV more positive than for I−/I3−172 and directly contributes to ΔGloss since no work is associated with disproportionation of I2− to I− and I3−. This energetic loss is built into the redox couple and cannot be circumvented. Taking disproportionation into account, a driving force for regeneration of 0.2–0.3 eV appeared to be sufficient instead of >0.8 eV as experimentally reported using the I−/I3− redox potential.145,146 The field accordingly revisited and developed other types of redox mediators to finely tune the regeneration driving force and reduce the associated ΔGloss.178
While significant progress has been made in solid-state179,180 and organic181 redox mediators, the best performing DSSCs use Cu- or Co-based liquid redox electrolytes.61,97,140 The redox potential of transition metal based mediators can be readily tuned to optimize DSSC function.146,169,182–184 Precise tuning of the driving force for dye regeneration minimizes the energetic losses (ΔGregloss) caused by an unnecessarily fast dye regeneration and reduces kinetic redundancy. For example, adding methyl groups to a tetradentate Cu ligand shifted the redox potential 300 mV more positive compared to the starting diamine–dipyridine ligand.184 The ΔGregloss was correspondingly reduced from 0.75 eV to 0.45 eV and resulted in a 0.18 V increase in VOC and almost a 50% gain in JSC. The optimized kinetics of dye regeneration (t1/2 = 0.45 μs) was 37-fold faster than recombination of the charge separated state (t1/2 = 16.5 μs) and still provided a regeneration efficiency of 97%.
The highest PCE reported for a DSSC is 14.3%, obtained by co-sensitization of TiO2 with LEG4 (triphenyl amine/cyclopentadithiophene) and ADEKA-1 (carbazole/oligothiophene) dyes.97 ADEKA-1 has the smaller Eg = 1.85 eV and the cell gave VOC = 1.01 V and ΔGloss = 0.84 eV. As seen in Fig. 14, electron injection into TiO2 occurs with ΔGinjloss = 0.36 eV. A [Co(phen)3]3+/2+ redox couple (0.62 V vs. NHE) was used, yielding ΔGregloss = 0.37 eV. The remaining 0.11 eV loss that is unaccounted for can be ascribed to intrinsic losses or reduction of the quasi-Fermi level in TiO2 due to electron trapping prior to collection.185,186

Kinetic investigations of ADEKA-1 DSSCs (with the caveat that these devices were optimized for spectroscopic studies which resulted in a reduced PCE ∼ 3%) indicated favorable kinetic competition for electron injection (∼1 ps17,187vs. a 500 ps excited state lifetime;17 estimated electron injection yield >99%) and the importance of a co-absorbent layer. The co-absorbent layer suppressed a fast TiO2-dye recombination on the sub-ns timescale17,187 and lengthened to TiO2 electron lifetime to 100 ms,187 sufficient for efficient charge extraction. Detailed kinetic investigations of state-of-the-art DSSCs would be invaluable to identify limitations and continue the optimization of DSSCs.


Organic photovoltaics. 
In organic photovoltaics (OPV), donor (D) and acceptor (A) materials are typically chosen to promote exciton dissociation through a thermodynamically favorable charge transfer (i.e., with an associated ΔGloss). An interfacial charge transfer (CT) state is formed at the D–A interface where the hole resides in the D material and the electron in the A material.188 The energy of the CT state (ECT) is lower than the optical bandgap (Eg) and limits the VOC (Fig. 15a). It is therefore common to express the energetic losses as the difference between qVOC and ECT, although in this text ΔGloss is referenced to Eg to accurately compare with other PV devices. Extensive non-radiative recombination, often considered to occur primarily through the CT state, contributes 0.5–0.7 eV to ΔGloss over a wide range of material parameters (Fig. 15b).189 Combined with factors such as the energetic offset to drive charge separation and energetic disorder (Fig. 15a), the ΔGloss of OPV devices is relatively large compared to other PV technologies (e.g., Fig. 8 and 16).

The energetic cost of charge separation and the difference between ECT and Eg at the interface is dictated by the offset of the donor and acceptor LUMOs (for electron transfer) or HOMOs (for hole transfer). The charge generation yield and the EQE has been observed to decrease as the energetic offset is reduced, pointing to a trade-off between high VOC and large currents.191–193 Interestingly, there are recent examples of charge generation efficiencies >50% in systems with small energetic offsets on the order of 0.1 eV.190,194–197 A recent report determined the activation barrier for CT state dissociation into free charges of a small energy offset system (PffBT4T-2OD:EH-IDTBR, offset <0.2 eV) to be 100 meV.198 Similar values were obtained for D:fullerene blends with energy offsets of >1 eV,199 indicating that CT state separation is largely insensitive to the D:A energy offset. It has been suggested that increasing the D:A energy offset can suppress the formation of bound CT states.193 The extent to which CT are bound or dissociative is also strongly dependent on blend morphology, with CT states formed within molecularly mixed regions tending to be more bound than those formation at domain interfaces.200
Considering a series of fullerenes with different LUMO energies, Guerrero et al. observed that the recombination kinetics are insensitive to changes in driving force.201 This was rationalized by considering that the driving force for recombination was similar to the reorganization energy (λ ∼ 0.7 eV) and proceeded near the maximal rate as predicted by Marcus theory. The increase in VOC observed with the highest lying LUMO acceptor was solely attributed to the energetic term. Factors such as the modulation of the electronic coupling202 and the molecular orientation203,204 of donor and acceptor components might be more effective to reduce the rate of charge recombination.
The kinetics of exciton separation in organic solar cells is dependent upon both the blend nanomorphology and donor/acceptor energy offsets. Increased phase segregation tends to slow both exciton separation and charge recombination kinetics, increasing the quantum efficiency at the expense of suppressed voltage output.205,206 Several recent studies have reported slower exciton separation kinetics for low energy offset blends, which in some case have been suggested to result in suppressed yields of charge separation.194,207–209 Identifying D–A pairs with small energetic offset where charge separation with low driving force effectively competes with exciton decay sets a path to high efficiency OPV.
Small molecules can also be used as the donor and acceptor materials to make all-small-molecule OPVs. Using small molecules instead of polymers increases the batch-to-batch reproducibility210 at the expense of more challenging phase separation to achieve a desirable charge transport network.211 Recently, PCEs over 15% have been achieved,212–215 highlighting the viability of the small molecule approach. The effect of side chain control of morphology was investigated with a series of small molecule donors with a bithienyl-benzodithiophene central unit.216 The introduction of fluorines on in the thiophene side chains led to the formation of denser and longer interpenetrated fibrous aggregates, beneficial for exciton separation and charge transport. fs-TAS was used to monitor the hole transfer from the Y6 acceptor to the SM1-F donor which occurred <100 ps. The ΔGloss slightly reduced from 1.04 eV to 1.01 eV with the introduction of the fluorine. A small molecule active layer of BTR-Cl:Y6 was improved by miscibility-induced morphology optimization with PC71BM.212 A 2.3-times longer charge carrier lifetime was observed with PC71BM, thought to be due to improved crystallinity and reduction of the domain size to match the diffusion length. The reduced recombination with the addition of PC71BM improved the FF (from 69.6% to 77.1%) and average PCE (from 13.7% to 15.1%). The VOC (833.4 mV vs. 837.7 mV; ΔGloss ∼ 0.71 eV) wasn’t affected, presumably due to the close alignment in CB edges for Y6 and PC71BM.216 Another report of a small molecule ternary blend showed stronger impact on the device performance.217 BTR:NITI, BTR:PC71BM, and BTR:NITI:PC71BM blends showed average PCE values of 6.8%, 9.0%, and 13.6%, respectively. The morphology of the blend and formation of CT states were impacted by the use of the two acceptors, NITI and PC71BM. BTR:PC71BM gave an electroluminescence peak at 990 nm attributed to low energy CT states. This peak is absent in BTR:NITI and the ternary BTR:NITI:PC71BM blend indicating that NITI resides between the BTR and PC71BM and prevents the formation of low energy CT states. This resulted in a low ΔGloss of 0.55 eV with the ternary blend. Another notably low ΔGloss of 0.52 eV was achieved with a ZR1:Y6 blend.218 Such a low ΔGloss is surprising considering a HOMO offset of 0.57 eV. The low ΔGloss is seemingly a result of the absence of low-energy CT states and correspondingly low radiative recombination losses of 0.04 eV. No CT state absorption is seen in the Fourier-transform photocurrent spectroscopy external quantum efficiency spectra and the electroluminescence spectra of ZR1:Y6 doesn’t show a red-shift compared to neat Y6. A relatively high EL EQE of 1.1 × 10−4 led to low nonradiative recombination losses of 0.24 eV. Interestingly, a hierarchical morphology was obtained with two different domain sizes of ∼10 and 70 nm, which gave the films good charge transport properties.
Organic semiconductors typically have a broad Gaussian distribution of state energies in line with the influence of chemical and structural defects.219 Thermalization/trapping of charges in the low energy tail states is responsible for reduced charge mobility220,221 and reduced VOC.222 Reduction of the tail density of state can lead to increases in VOC over 100 meV as a result of lower ΔGloss due to charge trapping.223,224 In another example by Burke et al., energetic disorder of 63–104 meV (Gaussian width) in five different blend systems contributes 75–210 mV of VOC loss.189 It has been suggested that small-molecule systems have lower energetic disorder compared to polymers which helps mitigate losses in VOC.225 It has also been suggested that extracting photogenerated charges prior to complete thermalization can lead to a reduction of energy loss,63 suggesting that faster charge extraction could lead to improved photocurrents and VOC's. Recent studies of high performance organic solar cells employing non-fullerene acceptors have linked their high performance to near ideal optical226 and electronic207 band edges, enabling a suppression of ΔGloss whilst maintaining a high quantum efficiency.
Recent developments in non-fullerene acceptors and ternary blends have lowered the ΔGloss of high performance OPVs to ∼0.5 eV.190,194,197,218,227–232 For typical values of the exciton lifetime (∼500 ps) and the charge carrier residence time (∼1 μs; see Table 1, entry 2) the timescale ratio of 1 μs/500 ps = 2000 translates to an energetic penalty of 59.2 meV × log(2000) = 195 meV calculated from the four-state model. This combined with the estimated intrinsic losses ∼325 meV suggests that it will be challenging to achieve OPV devices with ΔGloss < 0.5 eV and high quantum efficiency (Fig. 17), although some paths to lower the energy losses have been suggested233 and the ΔGloss typically reported may be underestimated because of interfacial dipole effects.234 The challenge to reach ΔGloss < 0.5 eV is also concluded from Fig. 7C which shows that a necessary lifetime gain of 2000 is reached for a ΔGloss of 600 meV, although the recent report of an OPV with a PCE of 17.3% and low ΔGloss of 450 meV is highly motivating.99 The importance of maximising exciton lifetime, and thus reducing lifetime gain required, has recently been highlighted by Brabec and co-workers, who have proposed a long exciton lifetime is particularly important for low energy offset, high performance blends.208

5.2 Non-excitonic photovoltaics

Inorganic solar cells. 
The small exciton binding energy <kbT for solar cell absorbers such as Si and GaAs means that thermal energy is sufficient to separate charges and that an energy offset is not essential.235–237 These materials also typically have favourable competition between the charge residence time and the recombination-limited lifetime. For Si, the lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers is typically on the order of 1 ms under 1 sun illumination conditions64,65,102 (although the strong influence of doping density should be noted238). Considering an electron diffusion coefficient of 36 cm2 s−167 and a typical thickness of 160 μm, the charge residence time is calculated to be about 10 μs (Table 1, entry 3), much shorter than the charge carrier lifetime. Extraction competes effectively with recombination reducing the need for an additional energy input (increasing ΔGloss) to separate charges and increase lifetimes. As such, the lifetime gain required for efficient function is insignificant, as illustrated in Fig. 7C, consistent with their high device efficiencies.
The tremendous efforts over almost 80 years of Si solar cell research to optimize parameters such as impurity levels, contacts, back reflector, surface passivation, and light-trapping structures have brought us tantalizingly close (26.7%102,104) to the theoretical conversion efficiency limit of about 29% for Si-based devices.239 Si solar cells (crystalline) show ΔGloss as low as 0.40 eV, slightly higher than the limit of 0.325 eV established in Section S2.4 of the ESI.† Seemingly, there are some voltage losses due to extrinsic factors. In the highest efficiency Si solar cell reported (26.7% certified efficiency,104 26.3% reported in the publication102), the measured VOC (744 mV) is only 8 mV lower than the theoretical prediction (752 mV) based on the Si substrate used.102 The authors point to an influence of surface and SRH recombination to explain the discrepancy. Analysis of the lifetime in the best passivated Si sample (not contacted) indicated that a VOC of 748 mV should be possible with their passivation process. See Section S2.5 (ESI†) for the energetic and kinetic impact of surface passivation.
Despite the commercial dominance of Si, the most efficient single junction solar cell is prepared from GaAs, with an efficiency reaching 29.1%.103,104 In a simple view, this is directly tied to the inherently higher radiative efficiency240 of a direct bandgap semiconductor (GaAs) compared to an indirect bandgap semiconductor (Si). This pushes the efficiencies closer to that predicted by detailed balance241 – the infamous Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limit.15,242,243 The experimental ΔGloss of GaAs of 0.29 eV103,104 appears to be already limited by intrinsic factors. Further significant gains in VOC are unlikely without reducing Boltzmann losses via solar concentration.244 As seen in Fig. 8, there are almost no VOC losses attributable to suboptimal JSC or radiative recombination.


Perovskite solar cells. 
Metal-halide perovskites have surged to the forefront of solar cell research since the discovery of their use as an absorber material.245,246 Charge carrier diffusion lengths on the order of microns94,247,248 imply a desirable combination of high charge carrier mobilities (∼10 cm2 V−1 s−1249) and long lifetimes. The near band edge absorption coefficients on the order of 105 cm−1250,251 enables the use of relatively thin absorber layers (compared to inorganic light absorbers) that reduce transport losses. Trap densities are exceptionally low (1015 cm−1 or less252,253) significantly reducing non-radiative losses. Internal PL quantum efficiencies >90%76,254,255 enable photon recycling and can result in a higher photogenerated charge density. The lifetime gain required perovskite solar cells is also small, analogous to Si and GaAs solar cells. In high performance perovskite solar cells, carrier lifetimes longer than 1 μs under relevant operational conditions have been reported (we note this lifetime is charge density dependent), similar to typical charge extraction times (Table 1, entry 5). These beneficial properties and advancements in the formation of high quality absorber layers has enabled an unprecedented rapid increase in photovoltaic PCE from 3.8% in 2009245 to over 25% since 2019.104,256,257 The increase in PCE over the years has also been accompanied by decreasing ΔGloss (Fig. 18).258

The architecture of perovskite solar cells evolved quickly since their discovery.252,259,260 The first perovskite solar cell was based on a DSSC architecture with MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 nanoparticles, acting as dye sensitizers on the surface of mesoporous TiO2.245 It was observed early in the development that the mesoporous TiO2 scaffold could be exchanged for insulating Al2O3 (Fig. 19).261 Removing the energetically downhill electron transfer from the perovskite to TiO2 improved the VOC by about 200 mV, which could also be related to interfacial trap states.262 Further progress in the formation of high quality perovskite layers with low defect densities and high coverage has also enabled efficient devices in a thin film (planar) solar cell architecture.263–265 Moving away from a high surface area interface with TiO2 avoids energetically downhill electron transfer, potentially reducing ΔGloss. It should be noted that a mesoporous TiO2 layer (100–200 nm thick) is still often used at the anode, in part to promote uniform growth of large crystal domains.266,267

The lifetime of trapped electrons, which accumulate during continuous irradiation, in the bulk in the prototypical MAPbI3 was found to be several microseconds.268 This long lifetime results in a low rate of recombination and mitigates non-radiative VOC losses. In line with this conclusion, it has been determined that the charge carrier lifetimes in perovskite layers are typically limited by the surfaces and grain boundaries.269 In other words, bulk recombination is often not limiting and bulk trap states are not the major source of losses.
Higher trap densities have indeed been observed at interfaces and grain boundaries compared to the bulk.270–272 Accordingly, passivation of perovskite layers has received considerable attention to reduce non-radiative recombination losses associated with surface recombination (see Section S2.5, ESI† for additional details on the importance of passivation) and increase the VOC and PCE. Many different groups and ligands can be incorporated into a perovskite structure,273 exemplified by the diversity of hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites used in high performance solar cells. Organic ligands,272,274–283 metal oxides,280 and inorganic ions76 have all been used to passivate non-radiative surface states. Furthermore, 2D/3D perovskite heterojunctions are promising to improve control of the surface and electronic interfaces,284,285 and have shown promise in improving stability.285,286 The success of Lewis bases as surface ligands suggest that detrimental surface defects are formed by under-coordinated lead atoms.269,272,279,280 Similarly, the large enhancement in PL quantum efficiency following passivation by potassium halide films suggests that halide vacancies form non-radiative trap states.76 Interstitial Pb and antisite defects have also been suggested to be important in the formation of traps.287 High PL quantum yields >90%76,254,255 have been achieved in passivated perovskites, indicating the potential for a low proportion of detrimental non-radiative recombination.
The photovoltaic performance of perovskites draws comparison with GaAs (Fig. 20). Champion cells of both types have high internal/external luminescent quantum efficiencies to enable photon recycling and suppress radiative VOC losses.76,288,289 The sharp absorption onset (low Urbach energy ∼15 meV) comparable to c-Si and GaAs has been empirically correlated to low VOC losses.251,290 The reduced energetic disorder is thought to decrease thermalization losses associated with relaxation into low energy states (equilibration energy is  below the transport energy, where σ is the width of a Gaussian DOS).63,291 Additionally, the exciton binding energies of MA and FA perovskites are estimated to be a few meV,236,237 thus below thermal energy at 300 K. The small exciton binding energy results in effective charge separation and free charge carriers dominate the dynamics under operation. It is also possible that local internal electric fields292 or potential differences293 promote charge separation and reduce charge recombination. Accordingly, no external energy offsets are needed to enable efficient charge carrier generation in high performance perovskite solar cells.

These factors, along with the minimal requirement for lifetime gain highlighted above, have led to low ΔGloss < 0.4 eV and many examples of VOC's within 150 mV of the SQ limit.294 Perovskite solar cells are correspondingly found in the bottom left corner of Fig. 7C.

5.3 Excitonic photosynthetic systems

Molecular donor–acceptor assemblies. 
Molecular excitonic PS systems are those that most resemble natural photosynthesis.297 A molecular light harvester is photoexcited to generate the initial exciton. A donor or acceptor is positioned nearby to promote charge separation and split the exciton. This initial charge separation has been extensively studied in molecular donor–acceptor (D–A) dyads, providing us with insights in the factors that control charge separation and recombination. Porphyrins, part of the chlorin family and closely resembling chlorophylls, have been a common choice for the light harvester, in part because of their relatively long singlet excited state lifetimes (typically a few ns's), reducing the lifetime gain required for efficient function.
The well-defined structure of molecular assemblies enables precise investigations of the factors that control charge transfer kinetics.298–304 Charge separation and recombination are particularly well-studied in dyads and triads with fullerene electron acceptors. Using a biphenylamine acceptor, going from one unit to two units on a fullerene accelerates both the charge separation (kCS = 1.3 × 1010 s−1vs. 1.8 × 1010 s−1) and the charge recombination (kCR = 3.0 × 106 s−1vs. 4.0 × 106 s−1) by roughly 30%.305 This is attributed to molecular crowding in the triad which pushes one of the pendent biphenylamine units toward the fullerene and reduces the donor–acceptor distance. Hole migration between the two biphenylamine units does not appear to take place. The rates of charge recombination decreased with solvent polarity, where less polar solvent yields a higher energy excited state, which suggested that the charge transfer process takes place in the Marcus inverted region.305 In other similar fullerene-biphenylamine dyads, shortening the linker causes an increase in the rate of charge separation (kCS = 3.0 × 109 s−1vs. 5.0 × 1010 s−1) and rate of charge recombination (kCR = 3.1 × 106 s−1vs. 4.5 × 106 s−1.), both by roughly 50%. The increase in rate is consistent with stronger electronic coupling and shorter distances between the donor and acceptor segments.306,307
A dyad consisting of a triphenyl amine-substituted porphyrin acceptor and a fluorinated subphthalocyanine donor demonstrated marked solvent dependencies.308 The rate constant for charge separation (kCS; electron transfer from the subphthalocyanine to the porphyrin) was almost constant at 1.0 × 1012, 9.0 × 1011 and 9.0 × 1011 s−1 for measurements performed in benzonitrile, toluene and benzene, respectively. However, for the same solvent series the charge recombination rate constant (kCR) varied from 5.0 × 1010 to 5.9 × 109 and 7.2 × 109 s−1. The ten-fold faster recombination in benzonitrile was explained from the similarity in the reorganization energy (∼0.5–1.0 eV) and the ΔGCR of 1.16 eV placing the process near the activationless region. In the nonpolar benzene and toluene solvents, ΔGCR = 1.41 eV is significantly larger than the reorganization energy and the recombination is in the slower Marcus inverted region. Notably, a proportion of much slower recombination (kCR = 2.7 × 103 s−1) was observed in benzonitrile, attributed to the spin effect of the triplet radical ion pair. This represents a remarkable 107 reduction in rate of recombination compared to the singlet charge separated state.
The spin multiplicity of the charge separated state clearly can dramatically affect the recombination kinetics.299,309–312 Increases in lifetimes of 3 or more orders of magnitude is often observed when comparing the decay of triplet charge transfer state to that of the singlet. A remarkable increase in lifetime was observed in the rigid donor–acceptor dyad shown in Fig. 21. While only the singlet manifold is accessed via direct photoexcitation, intermolecular photosensitization by benzophenone yields the triplet charge separated state.313,314 In acetonitrile, the lifetime of the triplet state is 1.4 μs, over five orders of magnitude longer than the corresponding singlet state (τ < 10 ps). Notably, the energy gap between the singlet and triplet charge transfer states was estimated to be 200–400 cm−1 (25–50 meV).314 The ideal lifetime gain for this energy relaxation of the triplet state is ∼3–7, obviously much smaller than the experimental result. Naturally, the simple energetic consideration derived from the four-state system in Section 3.2 ignores spin selection rules for electronic transitions and in this case underestimates the lifetime gain. It should be stressed that manipulation of the spin multiplicity seems to be one of the more promising routes to high-energy, long-lived charge separated states.

To enable photoredox catalysis, an organic dyad was designed with a high intersystem crossing yield to the long-lived triplet state.315,316 A charge transfer intermediate involving the naphthyl group (molecule 2 in Fig. 22) promotes the formation of the long-lived triplet charge transfer state where charge density moves toward one of the biphenyl arms.316 The initial singlet excited state has a lifetime of 5.2 ns and the long-lived triplet excited state has a lifetime of 480 μs. ΔGloss is estimated to be on the order of 1 eV and the lifetime enhancement is 105. The expected energy loss for this lifetime gain in an ideal 2 state system is 59.2 meV × log(105) = 296 meV, yielding an energetic efficiency of 30%. This is significantly lower than what is achieved in natural photosystems for sub-millisecond lifetimes (see Fig. 4) which avoids large ΔGloss in single steps.

Dye-sensitized photo(electro)chemical cells. 
In 2009 the DSSC device architecture was adapted to drive solar water splitting instead of producing an electrical output.317 The resulting dye-sensitized photoelectrosynthetic cell (DSPEC) combines a high bandgap nanoparticulate semiconductor (e.g., TiO2), a molecular dye-sensitizer, and a catalyst to drive the production of solar fuels by visible light.318 Both dye-sensitized photoanodes and photocathodes are possible. Far more progress has been achieved with photoanodes (e.g., compare entries 12 and 13 of Table 2; also see ref. 319) presumably because of the difficulties in producing a mesoporous p-type semiconductor with adequate interfacial charge transfer properties and charge mobility.320,321 We therefore focus our discussion on photoanodes.
Similarly, to the metal oxide photoelectrodes presented afterwards in Section 5.4, a bias is applied to the supporting semiconductor to promote charge separation at the interface and reduce recombination. Despite the additional energy input, back-electron transfer from the semiconductor to the oxidized dye or catalyst remains the most severe limitation in DSPECs.322 This can be understood by considering the greater lifetime gain required to drive water oxidation compared to charge extraction (Fig. 23, also recall Fig. 2). The typical timescale of back electron–hole recombination in a DSPEC is hundreds of microseconds and can be as fast as nanoseconds; significant enhancement of charge carrier lifetimes is therefore required to drive water oxidation catalysis (typically on ms-s timescale).

Dye-sensitized photocatalysts suffer from similar kinetic challenges (Fig. 24). Current high performance water oxidation molecular catalysts achieve reaction kinetics on the order of 1–10 ms (turnover frequencies [TOF] ∼ 100–1000 s−1).83,324,325 We note that a few molecular catalysts with TOFs > 1000 have been reported, yet large overpotentials326 or the use of expensive/rare elements327 have prevented practical applications. Comparing to DSSCs, dye regeneration is on the order of 1 microsecond145,328 and effectively outcompetes recombination. Additionally, significant recombination has been observed within tens of nanoseconds in TiO2/RuP aqueous systems near neutral pH329 while recombination in the analogous organic systems used in DSSCs is typically on the order of micro- to milliseconds.186 The contrast between DSSC and DSPEC kinetics and efficiencies underscore the general fact that PS typically operates at lower efficiencies than PV devices due to the significantly slower charge extraction kinetics, resulting a high lifetime gain requirement.

Transient spikes in DSPEC photocurrent are commonly observed (Fig. 25).108,319 Spectroelectrochemical and transient spectroscopy experiments point to the influence of interfacial trap states to explain the photocurrent behaviour and the low quantum yields. Proton intercalation in TiO2 films has been linked to shallow electron trap states, dramatically affecting the electron transport.331 In a dye-sensitized TiO2 film, intercalated protons were involved in electron trapping in sites promoting recombination with the oxidized sensitizer.322 These traps were also involved in decreasing the yield of electron injection.332 A detailed kinetic model was constructed from transient photovoltage measurements.333 The model showed that the concentration of trapped electrons and oxidized sensitizers slowly builds up over many seconds (Fig. 26). The model could reproduce the photocurrent transients, highlighting the role of (proton-induced) trap states on the device output.

A strong influence of the VOC on the recombination lifetime has also been observed in water splitting dye-sensitized photoanodes.322 Perhaps surprisingly, an approximate 10-fold decrease in recombination time (∼70 ms to 5 ms) increased the VOC from 700 mV to 1200 mV. The implied change in the TiO2 Fermi level position toward more negative energies for large VOC reduces the energetic barrier to charge detrapping, resulting in faster recombination. Note that the relationship between kinetics and energetics is far from that expected in a four-state system (59 mV difference for a 10-fold change in lifetime) which does not consider trapping/detrapping processes. Lower VOC's were observed as the IrO2 water oxidation catalyst loading was increased, indicating that the catalyst can scavenge photogenerated electrons through an undesirable short-circuit pathway.322
Co-sensitization is the simplest path to fabricate DSPEC electrodes. Here the sensitizer and catalyst bearing surface-binding groups are deposited on the semiconductor from solution. The lack of control of the charge transfer pathway is expected to introduce some inefficiencies in transferring charges to the catalyst. Covalently bound or supramolecular dye–catalyst dyads have been developed to ensure close proximity of a catalyst to each dye in efforts to control charge transfer kinetics.334 Akin to the peripheral electron donor in dyes for DSSC applications, hole transfer from the dye to the catalyst and away from the TiO2 surface results in an overall larger electron–hole spatial separation. Detrimental charge recombination is therefore slowed down by up to several orders of magnitude.335,336 Note that no additional energetic cost is introduced under the approximation that the catalyst's redox potentials are unchanged by covalent linkage. However, improved performance is not always observed in dye-catalyst dyads due to reduced electron injection efficiency. For example, the lower energy MLCT of a bi-Ru dye-catalyst complex involves the bipyridine that bridges the dye and catalyst.335 The lowest MLCT state in the isolated dye instead involves a TiO2-bound bipyridine, facilitating interfacial electron injection to TiO2 (and increasing the yield from ∼0.2 to 1). Additional non-radiative relaxation pathways (e.g., vibrational, energy transfer) may also be introduced when binding a catalyst to the dye.337
Ultimately, optimization of the molecular structures and assemblies needs to be done with kinetic competition in mind. The dominance of charge recombination makes it a logical target to improve the efficiency of DSPECs, yet the interplay between charge injection to the semiconductor, electron transport to the electrode, and charge transfer to the catalyst also needs to be considered. IPCE over 15% are predicted if the bimolecular rate of recombination is below 10−15 cm3 s−1, the catalyst turnover rate above 10 s−1, and the semiconductor charge diffusion coefficient is above 10−4 cm2 s−1.338 These values seem attainable considering that reducing the rate constant for recombination in TiO2 by an order of magnitude to 10−15 cm3 s−1 is predicted to give a device with an IPCE of 14.3%. A systematic approach that focuses on each individual parameter is the most common as it allows for rationalization of the results. However, the interplay of different parameters makes it unlikely that they can be optimized completely independently.

5.4 Non-excitonic photosynthetic systems

Metal oxide photoelectrodes. 
Metal oxide photoanodes are being actively pursued to provide the driving force for water oxidation in water splitting photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices (Fig. 27). Materials investigated include BiVO4, α-Fe2O3, WO3 and TiO2.339,340 Common characteristics of these materials are the use of Earth-abundant elements and VBEs most often in the range of 2–3 V vs. RHE. The top of the VB is often composed of O 2p orbitals which is considerably more positive than the potential of the water oxidation half-reaction. The substantial overpotential is thought to provide a large driving force for charge transfer and has been correlated with faster water oxidation kinetics.91

The charge carrier dynamics of metal oxides typically show fast electron–hole recombination on the ps–ns timescale.86,341,342 The desired chemical reactions, e.g., proton reduction and water oxidation, take place on the microsecond to second timescales.24,343 We again plainly identify one of the inherent challenges of water oxidation and artificial photosynthesis – the multiple orders of magnitude mismatch between recombination and reaction timescales (ps vs. s, 12 orders of magnitude in worst case scenarios, such as highlighted for hematite photoanodes91,341). Increasing the charge carrier lifetime of metal oxides is a recurring research topic. With the basic four-state system described in Section 3.2, increasing the lifetime of the charge separated state by 3 orders of magnitude will cost 59.2 meV × log(103) ≈ 180 meV of energy. If 12 orders of magnitude increase in lifetime is needed, the energy cost increases to ≈710 meV.
The fastest recombination involves (relaxed) free carriers, i.e., those occupying states near the CBE and VBE.24 Charge trapping on the fs–ps timescale competes with free carrier recombination. Charge trapping is itself an interesting example of the balance between reactivity and persistence of charges. The reduced mobility and reduced extent of the wavefunction of trapped charge carriers decrease the rate of charge recombination, corresponding to an increased charge carrier lifetime.344 For example, in TiO2 it has been suggested that recombination of charges in shallow traps (i.e., states near the band edges) occurs on a 1–10 ps timescale whereas deeply trapped charges recombine on timescales longer than 20 ns.345 Other studies have suggested longer timescales for these processes, with initially generated charges recombination on the ns timescale, and trapped charges living for up to ms.88,346 However, in both cases, the lifetime lengthening comes at the energetic cost of localizing charges in lower energy trap states. A broad range of electron and hole trapping energies in TiO2 have been reported, possibly due to a wide range of potential defects and the sensitivity of different techniques to probe the distribution of trap states.347–349 The characteristic exponential energy of electron trap states is typically on the order of 100–200 meV and the ΔGloss resulting from trapping can easily be several hundred meVs. The reduction in charge mobility due to trapping and associated shortening of the charge carrier diffusion length may also adversely affect the transport of charges to the electrolyte interface.342
The mismatch in charge recombination and interfacial reaction timescales leads to poor intrinsic water splitting efficiencies by metal oxides.350 A successful approach to increase water splitting efficiency, first evidenced by Fujishima and Honda,351 is to use metal oxides in a photoelectrochemical system. The key to the improved performance is the use of an external potential to control the band bending at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. Applying a positive potential lowers the energy of the Fermi level and induces upward band bending for n-type semiconductors (Fig. 28). The associated electric field in the space charge region pushes charges carriers in opposite directions: hole will accumulate at the interface with the electrolyte and electrons flow toward the bulk.

The spatial separation of charges reduces the concentration of electrons at the surface and dramatically increases the lifetime of surface holes. In the absence of tunneling processes, recombination at the surface is retarded due to charge depletion at the surface (electrons in this case). The charge carrier lifetime will have an exponential dependence on the barrier height, and accordingly, the applied bias. Increasing the barrier height by 0.5 eV can increase the charge carrier lifetime by 6 orders of magnitude,353 reasonably close to the 8 orders of magnitude expected for a 0.5 eV energy difference in a four-state system, and providing a clear quantitative indication of the energetic cost of lifetime gain.
TAS on the microsecond–second timescales has been used to show significant retardation of charge recombination upon applying a positive bias to a range of metal oxide photoanodes. As shown in Fig. 29 for α-Fe2O3 photoanodes, surface hole recombination is slowed down from ∼10 μs to over 1 s as the applied potential is increased from 0.7 to 1.5 V vs. RHE (compared to Vfb = 0.55 V vs. RHE).354 An increase in lifetime is also observed on the ultrafast timescale: from t50% ∼ 6 ps under 0.5 V vs. RHE applied bias to t50% ∼ 200 ps at 1.4 V vs. RHE.86 Li et al. used electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) to also conclude that the charge recombination timescale decreases upon applying a more positive applied bias,355 with the timescale of recombination increased from <ms to s when increasing the applied bias from 0.4 V to 1.4 V vs. RHE. Similar increases of surface hole lifetimes from μs to s has also been showed for BiVO4356 and TiO2.89 We note that the roughly 6 orders of magnitude increase in surface hole lifetime is not comparable to the 17 order of magnitude increase expected for applied potentials roughly 1 V more positive than the flat band potential (e.g., a 1 eV recombination barrier compared to an order of magnitude lifetime increase per 59.2 meV). The excess energetic cost compared to the four-state limit amounts to 645 meV. Under illumination the bend bending will decrease due to the accumulation of charges, reducing the recombination barrier and decreasing the energetic efficiency of using an applied bias to lengthen the lifetime. Additional considerations are the potentially inaccurate estimations of the slow charge recombination at very positive potentials because of the interference of the water oxidation reaction and the dispersive kinetics that span multiple orders of magnitude which introduces a practical limitation on comparing lifetimes. For example, since the recombination kinetics are charge carrier density dependant, different t50% will be observed for the different initial time (t0) and initial charge carrier densities in fs–ns TAS and μs–s TAS measurements.

The use of an applied bias to induce band bending must be considered in the overall energy conversion process. The applied bias effectively separates the Fermi levels of the working electrode and the counter electrode. Note that the potential difference between the working and counter electrodes is distinct from the typically controlled potential difference between the working and reference electrodes and isn’t directly the applied bias in a 3-electrode setup. For a photoelectrode, the solar energy conversion efficiency is given by the applied-bias photon-to-current metric (ABPC):52,357 (7)J is the photocurrent density, Vrxn is the potential difference of both half-reactions (i.e., 1.23 V for water splitting), Vbias is the potential difference between the working and counter electrodes and Pin is the power input (e.g., AM1.5G irradiation, 100 mW cm−2).
The ΔGloss was determined from the difference in bandgap (Eg) and the energy extracted (ΔGext), itself determined from the difference between the redox potential of the water splitting reaction (Vrxn) and the onset potential of photocurrent (Vonset): ΔGloss = Eg − ΔGext = Eg − e × (Vrxn − Vonset)(8)The energy extracted amounts to the effective photovoltage (Vpv; ΔGext = e × Vpv) generated by the photoelectrode. We note that the voltage difference between the illuminated photoelectrode and a nonphotoactive dark version of the electrode at the operating current would be a more accurate metric to obtain Vpv and ΔGloss.52 However these values are not readily reported preventing a representative comparison.
Entries 14–23 of Table 2 show that the ΔGloss of metal oxide photoelectrodes range from 1 eV to 2 eV. The larger energy loss compared to PV systems can be in part understood by the different charge carrier lifetime requirements, as mentioned above.
Broadly speaking, interfacial reactions to generate solar fuels are at least 3 orders of magnitude slower than charge extraction in PV devices (μs–s vs. ns–μs; Fig. 2).24,343 In ideal systems, we would expect ΔGloss to be ∼180 meV larger in PS systems compared to PV systems. Experimental PV systems have demonstrated performance approaching the thermodynamic limits while experimental PS systems tend to show a larger ΔGloss by about 1 eV, placing them in the upper right corner of Fig. 7C. The increased ΔGloss compared to PV systems is most likely a combination of the energetic loss associated with an applied external bias to increase charge carrier lifetimes, the large (surface) defect density typical of metal oxides352 and non-ideal material properties such as high non-radiative recombination358,359 and low charge carrier mobility.360 Theoretical analysis of efficiency limits for photoelectrochemical water-splitting have suggested that the attainable values may decrease from 30.6% in the ideal limit to as low as 5.4% for a material with parameters typical of Earth-abundant materials (Fig. 30).361 Interestingly, the maximum efficiency in the Earth-abundant case is predicted to be reached at a bandgap ∼2.5 eV, corresponding to a ΔGloss of at least 1.2 eV. To lower the optimal bandgap, and lower ΔGloss, there is a need to improve device parameters such as the catalytic exchange current density, the external photoluminescence efficiency and the series and shunt resistances.

5.5 Particulate photocatalysts
Particulate photocatalysts are being developed as a lost-cost alternative to photoelectrodes or PV + electrolysis systems.362,363 No external electrical contacts are required, significantly reducing system complexity, and presumably, cost.364 The lack of an external applied bias removes one contribution from ΔGloss but charge carrier lifetimes need to be sufficiently long in the absence of potential-induced band bending. This additional restriction limits materials with noteworthy efficiencies to a few examples.
We will focus on the simplest case where a single particle absorbs light and catalyses (with the help of cocatalysts if needed) both the oxidation and reduction reactions. Both excitonic and non-excitonic systems are possible. The distinction is not always clear or known due to our limited understanding of the initial excited states in these systems. A functional requirement is that both the CB and VB have suitable positions to drive the desired redox reactions. Naturally, kinetic competitions need to favor productive steps to achieve high efficiencies. Perhaps due to added challenge of performing precise optical spectroscopy on heterogeneous photocatalyst dispersions, there has been a limited number of detailed photophysical studies of high performance systems such as entries 24–31 of Table 2. Stable signals on the long monitoring timescales needed to follow e.g., the water oxidation reaction is difficult to achieve due to particle settling and light source fluctuations.
High apparent quantum yields (AQY; equivalent to the EQE of photovoltaic systems) >70% have been demonstrated by a few particulate photocatalysts. However, these high AQYs are only achieved with wide bandgap materials (i.e., Al:SrTiO3,120,365 Ga2O3366). The high energy light used to excite Al:SrTiO3 (390 nm) and Ga2O3 (280 nm) produces a large ΔGloss on the order of 2–3 eV to drive water splitting (extracted energy 1.23 eV). Even with this impressive activity in the UV, the poor sunlight harvesting of these UV-active photocatalysts leads to STH efficiencies <1%120,367 and limits practical applications.
Recently, a remarkable AQY of 96% for overall water splitting has been reported using Al:SrTiO3 and cocatalysts.120 Key to the high efficiency seems to be internal charge rectification that pushes electrons and holes to accumulate on different crystal facets (Fig. 31). A work function difference between (100) and (110) facets can induce band bending and impact the ratio of electrons/holes at their surfaces.368 Based on calculations, a 0.2 eV energy difference leads to a ratio of ∼103 in charge carrier densities, largely attributed to a decrease in minority charge carrier density. The bulk charge carrier densities also decrease by roughly an order of magnitude compared to the facet where they dominate. Assuming pure bimolecular second order kinetics, the rate of recombination would be expected to decrease by 102–103 in the bulk and on the surfaces. The slow down in kinetics is exceptionally close to the decrease of 2.4 × 103 calculated from a 0.2 eV larger ΔGloss from the four-state model. Trapping–detrapping processes increase the reaction order of recombination369 which could lead to an even larger decrease in the rate of recombination, surpassing the expectation from the simplified four-state model. The energy efficiency of work function differences appears to be highly promising, although it is not present clear if these differences alone are sufficient to achieve the lifetime gain required for efficient function. Other factors or synergy may also contribute the high performance of such photocatalysts.

To increase STH efficiencies, improve sunlight harvesting and lower the ΔGloss, we need to turn to smaller bandgap photocatalysts. Leading visible light particulate photocatalysts include GaN:ZnO,370 CoO121 and carbon nitride (CNx; also referred to in the literature as g-C3N4).371 However, the reduction in band gap combined with estimated overpotentials on the order of 300 meV for water oxidation and on the order of 100 meV for proton reduction reactions372–374 leave little room for extrinsic energy losses in an efficient system. The difficulty in accomplishing this is evident from the fact that a stable particulate system with a suitable combination of light harvesting and AQY (Fig. 32) to approach the 5–10% solar energy conversion target343,375 has yet to be developed.

The gold standard of visible light active particulate photocatalysts has been GaN:ZnO, a solid solution of GaN and ZnO, since its discovery in 2005.376 The AQY for the bulk system is 5.1% at 410 nm377 and can be further improved to 17.3% at 400 nm by nanostructuring.122 A recent photophysical study gave important insights into the operating conditions of GaN:ZnO and the role of Rh2−yCryO3 cocatalyst.378 Combining TAS with photoinduced absorption spectroscopy (PIAS) gave access to a broad range of timescales (microseconds to tens of seconds) and excitation conditions (pulsed vs. continuous irradiation). Charge trapping was evident from the nonexponential decay kinetics, excitation density measurements and PL maxima shift over time (Fig. 33).378,379 Hole traps are thought to reside ∼1 eV above the VBE while electron traps are thought to be 30 meV below the CBE,380–382 leading to a trapping ΔGloss component on the order of 1 eV. The total ΔGloss is 1.4 eV (entry 26, Table 2) making charge trapping the main cause of energetic loss. Remarkably, photogenerated (trapped) hole lifetime under operando conditions was 30 seconds, about 9 orders of magnitude slower than the fast recombination component observed on the nanosecond timescale.378,383
Charge trapping seems to be responsible for the lengthening in lifetime but is not energetically efficient in this case. Considering a simple four-state system, the hole trapping of 1 eV would be expected to increase the lifetime by a factor of 17 orders of magnitude, much more compared to the 9 orders of magnitude lifetime increase observed. However, we note that the 30 second lifetime is significantly longer than the 10 ms–1 s lifetime seen for metal oxides with the help of an applied bias.89,356,384,385 This comparison makes it unlikely that the long lifetime of holes in GaN:ZnO is solely due to charge trapping since such long lifetimes are not observed in other trap-containing metal oxides and oxynitrides.87,386–388 It was concluded that the remarkably long lifetimes of GaN:ZnO holes may be due to spatial charge separation driven by energetic offsets between GaN-rich and ZnO-rich phases,389 effectively creating a charge separating heterojunction.

CNx has emerged as a promising metal-free particulate photocatalyst. Using sacrificial hole scavengers, AQY for hydrogen production of 50% and more have been reported,390–394 highlighting the potential of CNx photocatalysts. However, under water splitting conditions the AQY is dramatically lower. The highest reported value is 16% at 420 nm for a carbon dot/CNx junction (entry 29, Table 2)125 and most other notable publication report AQYs on the order of a few percent.126,127,395–397 Spectroscopic investigation of CNx has revealed substantial charge trapping.398,399 An in-depth look at the distinct PL and TAS decays revealed that ΔGloss caused by charge trapping (predominantly electron trapping) could be over 1.5 eV (Fig. 34), comparable to the total ΔGloss of ∼1.6 eV (entries 30 and 31, Table 2).398 Similar to GaN:ZnO, charge trapping seems to be the main source of ΔGloss and reducing the density of low-energy trap sites while achieving sufficiently long charge carrier lifetimes is a key challenge.

Post-synthetic modification of CNx to convert amino terminal groups (H2NCNx) to cyanimides (NCNCNx) has been shown to improve H2 photoproduction under sacrificial conditions by up to a factor of 12.400,401 Interestingly, a blue color develops under anaerobic conditions, assigned to long-lived electrons with lifetimes of hours.402 Surprisingly, these long-lived electrons are able to drive proton reduction in the dark401,402 suggesting that the post-synthetic modification suppresses the density of low energy trap states. Unfortunately, the accumulation of long-lived electrons is expected to impede the accumulation of holes required to drive the more kinetically water oxidation and limit the water splitting activity.398,403 Continued development of CNx, and particulate photocatalysts more broadly, will be facilitated by a deeper understanding of the nature of trap states and establishing synthetic procedures to reduce their density. Of particular note, several recent studies have reported promising efficiencies for conjugated polymer photocatalysts.404–406
6. Conclusions
PV and PS systems are not often directly compared to each other presumably due to the differences in operating principles and outputs. However, the performance of both types of systems will be affected by the underlying photophysics and charge carrier dynamics. The photoexcited state needs to separate into charges, these charges need to reach the appropriate interface and then cross the interface into the desired layer. Under continuous sunlight excitation the system reaches a quasi-equilibrium where the kinetics of the system dictate the excited state populations and are tied to the energetics. We have considered this link between kinetics and energetics in a holistic comparison of solar energy conversion devices, spanning natural and artificial systems. Our empirical kinetics-based analysis provides a compelling framework to evaluate the potential of solar energy conversion systems in comparison to the idealized, thermodynamics-based SQ limit.
We highlight how the energetic performance of experimental devices is related to their underlying kinetics, and particularly the lifetime gain required for efficient function. A four-state model yielded an expected energy cost of 59.2 meV for every order of magnitude increase in the necessary lifetime gain, calculated as the ratio of the charge extraction lifetime to the recombination lifetime. From reported representative high performing PV and PS systems, we extracted an experimental energetic cost of 86.8 meV per order of magnitude lifetime increase, 47% higher than expected. Many factors may cause the difference between the expected and experimental energy costs, such as recombination from charge separated states,269,407 multiple intermediate states,200 energetic distribution of electronic states,130,222 and non-thermalized processes.63 It remains striking that such a simple kinetic model that ignores these effects captures much of the underlying photophysics of complex energy conversion systems.
The most remarkable distinction is the much smaller energy lost during conversion in PV devices (ΔGloss ∼ 0.3–0.9 eV) compared to PS systems (ΔGloss ∼ 1.3–1.8 eV). The large energy loss in PS devices directly correlates with the greater lifetime gain required due to the slow kinetics of multi-redox catalysis. The difference of ∼1 eV in energy lost amounts to a large fraction of the incoming photon energy (roughly 1.8–3 eV in the visible range). The difference in energy lost is reflected in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PV and PS devices. Many different PV architectures have achieved >20% PCE while this benchmark has not yet been reached for PS systems. The PS systems that show the highest PCE are typically constructed as a PV-electrolyser where an effectively buried junction, with photophysics like those of a PV system, generates the electrochemical potential difference required to drive the redox potentials. The PCE of systems where the semiconductor interfaces with the electrolyte is usually limited to <5%. This can be attributed to the greater maturity of PV and electrolytic technologies, and the materials challenges required to fabricate efficient and durable PS devices.
Small values of ΔGloss ∼ 0.3–0.4 eV are observed in high performance non-excitonic PV devices such as Si, GaAs, and perovskite solar cells. For excitonic PV devices such as OPV and DSSCs, the best values of ΔGloss to date are on the order of 0.5–0.9 eV. This difference can be understood primarily from the larger lifetime gain typically required for excitonic PV devices, with singlet exciton lifetimes are typically limited to a few ns. DSSCs have ΔGloss contributions from exciton splitting and regeneration of the dye. In the DSSC with the highest PCE reported to date,97 these two processes each operate with losses of 0.36 and 0.37 eV, respectively. The energy lost in one of these processes is already larger than that seen for a complete GaAs PV cell (0.29 eV).
The large ΔGloss of PS systems can be linked to the kinetic challenge of the multi-electron, multi-proton redox reactions required for fuel synthesis. A truly sustainable PS system will most likely involve water oxidation. The highly evolved natural PSII system can oxidize water on timescales up to 2 ms.408 The best performing molecular water oxidation catalysts show turnover on the ∼ms timescale under chemically driven conditions, and even lower turnover frequencies typically observed in light-driven systems, due to the challenge of extracting electrons at sufficient rates from the catalyst. The analogous step in PV systems is the extraction of charges by the collecting electrodes. Even considering the transport of charges to the interface, charge extraction in PV is at most a few microseconds, 3 orders of magnitude faster (and usually more) than water oxidation.
The increased kinetic challenge of PS systems, and associated energetic losses, are not insurmountable. Considering a typical initial excited state lifetime of 1 ns, charge carrier lifetimes of hundreds of milliseconds should be sufficient with optimised catalysts to compete with water oxidation. A four-state model with equilibrium between the initial excited state and the charge separated state predicts that a ΔGloss of 475 meV is sufficient to permit the necessary 8 orders of magnitude increase in lifetime. For the overall water splitting reaction and neglecting catalytic overpotentials, this puts the minimum bandgap at 1.71 eV or 725 nm. There is a flux of 1.38 × 1021 photons s−1 m−2 in the <725 nm spectral range which can be used to generate 6.9 × 1020 molecules of H2 s−1 m−2. H2 contains 237.1 kJ mol−1 of energy and the maximal possible PCE is then calculated to be 27.1%.
The natural PSI and PSII systems operate at roughly 80% of the four-state limit. Optimized artificial systems should be able to attain this efficiency which gives a ΔGloss of 600 meV and a corresponding photon flux of 1.17 × 1021 photons s−1 m−2 and maximal PCE of 23.0%. Demonstrated state-of-the-art artificial PS systems do not approach 80% energetic efficiency compared to the four-state limit, at least for systems requiring large lifetime gains. For instance, DSSC devices require smaller necessary lifetime gains of about 6 orders of magnitude and still have ΔGloss larger than 600 meV.
A sensible route to improve the PCE and energetic efficiency is the development of strategies that increase charge carrier lifetimes while avoiding unnecessarily large thermodynamic driving forces. Controlling the charge carrier dynamics with effects such as internal electric fields,409–411 manipulating spin dynamics412–414 and improving surface passivation415,416 are promising. A recent report of photocatalytic water splitting with an AQY of 96% is a striking demonstration of how a system can be optimized on multiple fronts (defect suppression, crystallinity, selective cocatalysts, facet engineering with different work functions) to reach the limits of a material.120 Identifying or developing photocatalytic materials with longer intrinsic charge carrier lifetimes will also reduce the ΔGloss expended to lengthen their lifetimes to enable function. This is necessary for visible-light absorbing semiconductors which have more strict energy budgets.
Ultimately, both PV and PS systems are designed to achieve the conversion of sustainable solar energy into a form of energy that is easily integrated and deployed in our society. Si solar cells are the dominant source of installed solar energy production and are likely to remain for some time. It remains to be seen which strategies emerge as viable on a global scale through monumental efforts to decarbonize our energy supply. The continued refinement of our understanding of the fundamental working principles of solar energy conversion devices is essential to provide the best routes for improvements and reach environmental targets in a timely manner. We hope that the concept of the energetic cost needed to increase lifetimes presented here from a simple kinetic model and in sufficient agreement with high performance systems help accelerate developments in solar energy conversion.

 	Fig. 10  Exciton splitting at donor–acceptor interfaces. (a) Formation of charge transfer (CT) exciton (dashed oval with purple fill) following electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor. EEX is the singlet donor exciton binding energy and ECT is the CT exciton binding energy. Adapted from ref. 131 with permission of the American Physical Society, copyright 2008. (b) The singlet donor exciton (blue) can form CT excitons and charge separated (CS) states (grey). Increasing DOS with energy in the CT–CS manifold is defined by the Coulomb potential (dashed curve) and represented by darkening greys. The red curves depict electron–phonon coupling.
