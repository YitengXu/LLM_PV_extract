    , Accepted 25th November 2015First published on 2nd December 2015AbstractWe observe thermally stable growth of fcc(111) films of fullerene-C60 on top of crystalline, flat-lying, CuPc film structures on graphite using combined grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering and atomic force microscopy. Such a morphology is nearly ideal for bilayer films of C60/CuPc in solar cells. Very similar crystallinity and morphology is observed when varying the film thickness of either material from 5 nm up to more than 100 nm, suggesting that this advantageous solar cell morphology is not only robust, but may actually be preferred compared to the typical mounded fullerene morphology often seen on standing, edge-on aromatic film substrates. The large, ordered domains observed in both materials and the cofacial interface should greatly increase charge carrier mobility leading to increased fill factor. We envision that bilayer films, such as described here, grown on very high quality graphene as a transparent conducting electrode would simultaneously optimize crystallinity and molecular orientation for peak solar cell performance.
I. Introduction
Small molecule organic semiconductors initiated the field of organic photovoltaics1 (OPVs) and, in the donor–acceptor bilayer device architecture, provided some of the first glimpses of the upward efficiency trends that persist to this day.2,3 With the advent of new molecules with tunable ionization potentials and good optical absorption properties4 as well as novel tandem,5 p–i–n,6,7 and graded device architectures,8 progress toward competitive efficiencies is promising.
Most of the advances in small molecule OPVs use molecular beam deposition to, in principle, allow very precise film thickness control down to the single molecular layer. There are advantages to be gained by creating flat donor–acceptor (D–A) interfaces between highly crystalline materials that reduce carrier recombination losses compared to intermixed D–A films.9,10 The value of this possibility is contingent upon a stable, crystalline, film growth mode. Otherwise, molecular-scale intermixing at the D–A interface occurs, inducing small randomly oriented domains, often without a percolating pathway to the electrodes, which is detrimental to device performance.
Surprisingly, there are relatively few examples of cofacial D–A growth modes in organic D–A bilayers which are also thermally stable. Often interfacial energies between donor and acceptor layers lead to a strong tendency for dewetting11 or phase separation.12–15 Since intermolecular interactions are generally weak in organic molecular materials, it is rare that D–A interactions are strong enough to stabilize a cofacial growth mode without tipping the balance toward intermixing16 that would create a non-abrupt (graded) interface. Moreover, kinetic roughening of organic films during growth can lead to a rough donor film which subsequently templates a similarly rough acceptor film.11
Interfacial energetics are particularly unfavorable for fullerene acceptor films which have a reasonably strong cohesive energy and relatively weak interaction with substrate molecules. Moreover, nearly isotropic fullerenes tend to have a steric incompatibility with planar aromatic donor molecules and a strong tendency for phase separation even in bulk mixtures.16 Fullerene films grown on top of flat-lying pentacene consist of crystallites of only tens of nanometers in diameter.17 A similar morphology is seen for C60 films on top of copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) films grown on SiO2 and the tendency for dewetting can be greatly accelerated by only modest thermal annealing.18 In contrast, C60 films grown on standing pentacene form large, flat, ordered domains ∼100–1000 nm wide.19 Similarly, C60 films grown on standing diindenoperylene (DIP) exhibit uniformly oriented fcc crystals with the (1 1 1) plane parallel to the substrate.20 We have argued in the past that controlled dewetting might be of interest for nanometer scale film morphology engineering.18 However, it is not yet known what particular morphology will be optimal for organic electronic devices and we also need the versatility to create ultra-flat, abrupt, and cofacial D–A interfaces.
Within a bilayer device geometry (as in bulk heterojunction devices), it is crucial to understand and control relative molecular orientation at D–A interfaces. This is necessary to allow the most efficient charge transfer across the interface since excited state coupling is strongly orientation dependent. The general intuition is that a cofacial orientation in which π electron clouds are well-coupled promotes charge separation.21–23 However, one also needs to balance efficient coupling with the possibility of detrimental geminate recombination across the interface.24,25 This makes the evaluation of orientation controlled bilayers one of the most important problems in organic electronic materials, particularly when the added question of D–A intermixing at the buried interface is considered.26
In this paper, we present observations of a thermally stable growth mode of crystalline C60 films on top of flat-lying CuPc films on graphite that establish a robust cofacial orientation at the D–A interface. We take advantage of CuPc films reported previously on graphite,27 with large crystalline domains the size of which is limited primarily by the substrate defect density. On top of these films, we grow C60 that exhibits comparable long-range crystalline ordering and flat surface morphology that is stable to extensive annealing at 150 °C. Crystal structure is inferred from GIWAXS and reveals an expected fcc(111) oriented film alongside a coexisting (122) orientation induced by substrate defects. Atomic force microscopy images show that the C60 films exhibit flat terraces on top of CuPc domains with steps heights only on the order of a single molecule. This D–A film structure and morphology enables a stable and abrupt cofacial interface between CuPc and C60 and could be used in operational solar cells employing graphene as a transparent electrode. More immediately, this is an important model experimental system for the ongoing assessment of the nature of cofacial interaction between fullerene acceptors and aromatic donors.21–23
II. Experimental methods
C60 (98%) and CuPc (95%) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and loaded, as received, into quartz and boron nitride crucibles, respectively. The crucibles were then outgassed for ∼24 hours in high vacuum prior to film growth. HOPG was exfoliated using scotch tape immediately before loading into the deposition chamber. C60 and CuPc thin films were grown using thermal evaporation at pressure < 2.0 × 10−6 torr in a high vacuum chamber with a base pressure of 10−9 torr. Deposition rates, monitored using a quartz crystal microbalance, between 0.01 Å s−1 and 0.2 Å s−1, typically 0.05 Å s−1, were used during film growth. AFM was carried out in AC mode in air using a commercial instrument (Asylum Research MFP-3D). Commercial AFM tips (Budget Sensors, Tap300AL-G) had a nominal radius of ∼10 nm and a nominal resonant frequency of ∼300 kHz. Annealing was performed in a dry nitrogen glove box with less than 0.1 ppm O2 and H2O.
GIWAXS data was acquired at beamline 7.3.3 at the Advanced Light Source28 at grazing angles between 0.10° and 0.20° above the plane of the substrate. For data acquired on HOPG substrates, the x-rays were incident on a region of the substrate that was visibly flat, uniform, and did not contain flakes. To make the C60 scattering peak at qxy = 0 Å−1 and qz = 0.767 Å−1 visible to the reader, particularly for Fig. 2a and c where the intensity is weak, transformation of the axis to proper q-space, with missing wedge corrections along the qz axis was not performed for Fig. 2. Instead, the axis in Fig. 2 is denoted as being approximately qz and qxy. To allow the reader to access the accuracy of the crystal orientations assigned in this paper, simulated GIWAXS peak locations have been overplotted on the data from Fig. 2c and d, but with transformation of the axis to proper q-space, with missing wedge corrections along the qz axis.

III. Results

Fig. 1 shows a series of AFM images of C60 films of different thicknesses grown on CuPc/HOPG. Overall, the C60 film morphology resembles that of the CuPc film substrate well along the striped subdomains. The lateral size of a given C60 domain is primarily limited by the size of the flat CuPc subdomain on which it forms. CuPc film morphology and roughness is determined by the quality of the graphene or graphite substrate, which was described previously.27 Although further study of the morphology dependence of neat CuPc films on defects in graphitic substrates is needed to avoid electrical shorts due to the cracks between CuPc domains, subsequently adding C60 should not introduce any additional obstacles for OPV devices.
In Fig. 2, we report GIWAXS data for the films shown in Fig. 1. Distinct spots in the scattering pattern indicate good crystallinity in the fullerene films. Moreover, the pattern is independent of thickness and does not show any trace of the ring-like features characteristic of typical poorly-crystalline fullerene films with a large distribution of orientations with respect to the substrate plane.
Simulation of the diffraction pattern can be achieved by assigning the film as an fcc fullerene film with coexisting (111) and (122) orientations parallel to the substrate plane. Simulated diffraction patterns for the observed crystal orientations for C60 and CuPc are shown in Fig. 3. A sharp double peak, centered at qxy ∼ 0 Å−1 and qz ∼ 0.95 Å−1, which streaks vertically, slightly overlapping the [111] reflection of the (111) orientation, as seen at the very top of Fig. 2d, is scattering from the HOPG substrate. The [111] reflection of the (111) orientation is seen at qxy = 0 Å−1 and qz = 0.767 Å−1. The [111] reflection of the (122) orientation is seen at qxy = 0.209 Å−1 and qz = 0.738 Å−1. We find that the relative intensity ratio of these two reflections is the same for all samples to within our experimental sensitivity, showing that there is no strong thickness dependence to the creation of the coexisting orientations.

The (111) orientation has been previously reported for similar C60 films of a fixed thickness on CuPc/HOPG.23 Our data indicates an unusual (122) orientation also exists which we presume is nucleated at defects. The AFM data in Fig. 1 clearly shows two distinct morphological features in the form of large flat domains as well as smaller granular features. Correlation to the GIWAXS data strongly suggests that the flat domains are the (111) orientation, exemplified by the domain in the bottom left of Fig. 1(c) and the more granular features are the (122), exemplified by the small rough domains in the bottom right of Fig. 1(c), which are evidently less prevalent in terms of area coverage.

Fig. 4 demonstrates the crucial new observation of the thermal stability of C60 films when grown on flat-lying CuPc. A 30 nm C60/150 nm CuPc/HOPG film was characterized by AFM both as-grown, shown in Fig. 4a, and after annealing at 105 °C for 48 h, with no apparent changes to the topography. The same sample was further annealed at 150 °C for 24 h, and characterized by AFM, shown in Fig. 4b, as well as by GIWAXS, shown in Fig. 4c, showing no evidence of a surface nor bulk morphology change due to annealing. This is in dramatic contrast to our previous observations of thermal dewetting that results in C60 mound coarsening on CuPc/Si substrates.18

IV. Discussion
Both AFM and GIWAXS show that the C60 film morphology, crystallinity and mosaicity is essentially the same for 5.5, 30, and 150 nm C60/30 nm CuPc/HOPG, as well as for 30 nm C60/150 nm CuPc/HOPG. This thickness independence typifies a cofacial growth mode of fullerene-C60 on flat CuPc that is not commonly observed in D–A bilayers. Most importantly, the film morphology is very stable to thermal annealing, indicating a relatively strong cofacial interaction at the flat D–A interface compared to other edge-on films.18 In particular, the fact that the film morphology is very insensitive to annealing means that there is no significant driving force for intermixing at the interface in this system. Given the observation of this unusual organic film growth mode, it is worthwhile to recount the arguments in favor of a single D–A interface geometry for organic solar cells.
At present, world record power conversion efficiencies for organic solar cells are achieved using the blended polymer–fullerene bulk heterojunction approach.29 The rationale for this film morphology is to control mesoscale D–A domain sizes to promote efficient exciton dissociation at D–A interfaces. Domains are engineered to match exciton diffusion lengths so that almost all photo excitations can find their way to an interface before recombining.
However, achieving efficient dissociation of excitons is useless if the charges are not able to transport to the electrode. Typically, once a free hole (electron) is in a donor (acceptor) domain it is not energetically favorable to transfer to the other material. Thus, a continuous pathway to the electrodes is needed for both the donor and acceptor materials. It is challenging to ensure such continuous pathways in BHJ devices. Without numerous percolation paths to the electrodes, charges can become trapped, leading to bimolecular recombination. This makes it challenging to simultaneously optimize both exciton dissociation and bimolecular recombination in a BHJ device.
The layered and crystalline features of the C60/CuPc bilayer films we have created represent a possible alternate approach to meeting this challenge. The large, flat, 3D, single crystal island growth in both the CuPc and C60 is advantageous for minimizing recombination. The charges from dissociated excitons not only have a continuous path to the electrode in the donor/acceptor material, the shortest path to the electrode is located within a single-crystal domain. This means that charge traps and bimolecular recombination will be limited by charge extraction at the electrodes, which can be easily improved with choice of electron/hole blocking layers and choice of metal for the cathode.
For this reason, we consider it still an open question to what extent bilayer devices can be further improved for organic solar cell technology. Charge transport can be efficient and bimolecular recombination suppressed in a bilayer. However, exciton dissociation will be much less efficient than in a BHJ. Our results here and in our previous CuPc/graphene study27 also indicate the importance of using very high quality substrates for optimizing crystalline order in small molecule OPV materials. Both for fullerene films and the CuPc substrates on which they are grown, preexisting defects on growth substrates can nucleate secondary crystal orientations. The resulting disorder in unfavorable for charge transport and needs to be avoided. Similar recent observations for pentacene films growth on graphene suggest that these ideas are broadly applicable to small molecule films grown on graphitic substrates.30
Thus, an organic solar cell technology based on a D–A bilayer will look much more like traditional photovoltaic technologies where crystalline materials are important and single “p–n” junctions are used to establish a built-in electric field. In highly crystalline bilayer device, we will still need to use the chemical potential difference at the D–A interface to dissociate excitons. In the current state of the art, we still need to improve carrier mobilities and exciton diffusion lengths in both donor and acceptor materials. However, this device morphology has advantages in terms of recombination losses as already mentioned and also lends itself to efficiency improvements through the tandem cell construction.5
The stability of this system under thermal annealing indicates a distinct advantage to OPV device longevity compared to typical fullerene based BHJ films. First, it demonstrates that the cofacial C60:CuPc interface interaction not only induces large, ordered, crystal growth of the C60 film, but is also in a preferred, thermally stable, equilibrium. It has been shown31 that a major source of degradation in C60 films is due to UV-induced polymerization of the C60, which has been demonstrated to be reversible when annealed at 110 °C.14 Our films are compatible with this annealing treatment, unlike typical, quasi-stable, -fullerene BHJ films which undergo morphological changes under annealing at 110 °C.32
V. Summary and conclusions
In summary we report thermally stable, cofacial, growth of fcc fullerene-C60 films on flat-lying CuPc films on graphite. This contrasts sharply with the typical granular, polycrystalline C60 film morphology found on edge-on organic film substrates.17,18 We observe that the C60 film morphology remains the same for 5.5, 30, and 150 nm C60/30 nm CuPc/HOPG, as well as for 30 nm C60/150 nm CuPc/HOPG. There is only minor crystalline disorder in the form of an alternate fcc(122) orientation with respect to the substrate plane, which we believe is related to nucleation at substrate defects. Most importantly, we observe no tendency for fullerene dewetting, even after annealing. This very stable growth mode indicates a strong interaction at the D/A interface. This is consistent with the general intuition in the organic photovoltaic community about the value of cofacial interactions between planar aromatic species and fullerenes to enhance coupling for OPVs.21–23
These observations are important for confirming that cofacial interactions between C60 and CuPc can be relatively strong and possibly promote efficient charge transfer in OPVs. In addition, the high crystalline quality of both donor and acceptor films points to very efficient charge transport after separation that is likely to minimize bimolecular recombination. If the recent trend of improving small molecule film quality continues, it will be worthwhile to consider whether the simplest bilayer OPV architecture should be re-visited and explored in functioning devices.
