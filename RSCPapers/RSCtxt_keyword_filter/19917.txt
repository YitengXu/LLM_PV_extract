    , Accepted 23rd July 2012First published on 24th July 2012AbstractHigh-performance hybrid solar cells (HSCs) based on P3HT:CdSe QD blends are achieved through post-deposition ligand exchange by n-butanethiol (n-BT) with a high power conversion efficiency of 3.09%. The mechanism by which n-BT modifies the surface structures of CdSe QDs and thus improves the HSCs performance is investigated.
Hybrid solar cells (HSCs) based on conjugated polymers and colloidal inorganic semiconductors offer the opportunity to exploit the best organic electron donors with solution processability and inorganic electron acceptors with intrinsic high electron mobility (which organics typically lack). Thus, HSCs should show comparable and even superior photovoltaic performance in comparison to organic-based solar cells.1,2 So far, a variety of semiconductor nanocrystals, such as CdSe,3 CdS,4 ZnO,5 TiO2,6 PbS,7–9 have been used to fabricate HSCs exhibiting power conversion efficiencies (PCE) mostly in the range of 0.23–3%.10–12 These values are, however, lower than the state-of-the-art organic-based solar cells.13–15 This discrepancy implies that there is huge room for the improvement of HSCs, spurring investigations of the mechanisms limiting the HSC performance.10,16–19
To improve the performance of HSCs, researchers have reported a number of efforts, such as tuning the inorganic nanocrystal size and shape,18,20 surface modification of the nanocrystals,11,21 introducing low band gap conjugated polymers,22 functionalization of the conjugated polymers,12,23 and optimization of the device structures.10 Among them, the surface chemistry of the inorganic nanocrystals has been considered as a crucial factor that greatly influences the performance of HSCs. For example, the nonconductive surfactants on the surface of as-synthesized nanocrystals have disastrous effects on the coupling between the inorganic nanocrystals or between the conjugated polymers and the inorganic nanocrystals.8,24,25 If the nonconductive surfactants are replaced by short-chain ligands or small molecules in solution, the performance of HSCs could be improved. However, pyridine, which is widely used in the solution exchange process, could not completely remove the long-chain ligands due to its weak interaction with the nanocrystals; however, other small molecules or ions with strong interactions could reduce the solubility of nanocrystals in non-polar solvents, which is favorable for the fabrication of HSCs.14–17 Recently, a post-deposition ligand exchange protocol using small bifunctional molecules, such as amines,26 thiols26,27 and hydrazine,27 has become popular for the further modification of nanocrystal surfaces in HSCs. For example, Wu et al. have developed the benzene-1,3-dithiol (BDT) vapour annealing method to strip off the residual phosphoric acid from CdSe nanorods after casting the active layer and improved the PCE from 1.56% to 2.65%.11 Another small molecule, 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT), was also employed by the Xue and Prasad groups in a liquid phase post-deposition treatment, demonstrating a similar role to BDT.7,16 It was proposed that such bifunctional molecules could anchor and cross-link quantum dots, which would favour charge transport in the films.11,21
To date, although the mechanisms underlining the limited PCE values of HSCs are still only partially understood, more evidence has proved recently that post-deposition ligand exchange by short-chain molecules could efficiently remove the detrimental long-chain ligands on the surface of the nanocrystals and improve the polymer–nanocrystal interface. Herein, we investigate the mechanisms by which short-chain ligands modify the surface of the nanocrystals and the HSC performance through systematically examining a group of ligands, including dithiols and monothiols, with varied chain lengths. By employing the blends of CdSe spherical nanocrystals and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the active layer, we achieved a maximum PCE of 3.09% using monothiol with a short-chain of n-butanethiol (n-BT). This value is higher than those from the typically used bifunctional ligands for HSCs containing P3HT:CdSe QD blends.16 As such, this work provides new scope for HSC optimization and the understanding of post-deposition ligand exchange mechanisms.
The device architecture of the investigated P3HT:CdSe QD HSCs is shown in Fig. 1a. Fig. 1b shows the energy level diagram of the corresponding device with 6.7 nm CdSe QDs. The band gap of the QDs, as estimated from its absorption onset, is 1.8 eV. The electron affinity and ionization potential of the 6.7 nm CdSe QDs are therefore estimated to be 4.4 eV and 6.2 eV, respectively, based on the QDs’ value in the bulk and the relative shifts of the conduction and valence band edges in the nanocrystals due to the quantum confinement effect.20 The average sizes of the CdSe QDs used here are controlled in the range of 5.8 nm to 6.7 nm, calculated according to the wavelength of the first excitonic absorption peak.28 The typical UV–vis absorption spectra of the CdSe QDs with an average size of 6.7 nm and the corresponding TEM image can be found in Fig. S1 (ESI†), indicating their spherical shape and well controlled size distribution. Using blends of such CdSe QDs and P3HT as the active layer, we first investigated the effect of post-deposition ligand exchange by the monothiol of n-BT on the performance of HSCs. Fig. 1c shows a dramatically improved photovoltaic response of the devices after n-BT treatment. The photovoltaic performance parameters (short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF) and PCE) of these corresponding devices are summarized in Table 1. Compared to the device without post-deposition ligand exchange, n-BT treatment leads to a 21% increase in JSC from 6.54 ± 0.23 to 7.91 ± 0.16 mA cm−2, a 7.7% increase of the FF from 0.52 to 0.56, and a negligible reduction in VOC. These changes improve the PCE from 2.30 ± 0.11% to 3.00 ± 0.09%, with an overall improvement of 30.4%. The external quantum efficiencies (EQE) before and after n-BT treatment are compared in Fig. 1d. The device after n-BT treatment shows much higher EQE values covering the whole absorption range with a maximum value of approximately 70% at around 440 nm, which is consistent with its higher JSC.

The effect of n-BT treatment on the HSCs performance was found to be more effective in smaller nanocrystals (Table 1). The performance of HSCs based on CdSe QDs with an average size of 5.8 nm manifested a 76.4% enhancement in the PCE after n-BT treatment. As reported by Xue et al., in smaller nanocrystals a greater portion of atoms are located on or near the nanocrystal surface and, hence, there should exist a higher density of surface defects due to dangling bonds.20,29 We believe such dangling bonds could be reduced by the capping effects of n-BT; thus, the smaller the CdSe QDs, the more significant the enhancement in the PCE after post-deposition ligand exchange. A similar phenomenon was also observed when EDT was used as the post-deposition exchange ligand.16
We studied the performance of the devices based on CdSe QDs with an average size of 6.4 nm before and after post-deposition ligand exchange by monothiols with different chain lengths of 4 C (n-BT), 8 C (n-octanethiol, n-OT), and 12 C (n-dodecanethiol, n-DT). Their J–V curves are shown in Fig. 2 and the average parameters are summarized in Table 1, while their EQE curves can be found in Fig. S2 (ESI†). It was observed that the enhancement of the device performance is dramatically influenced by the chain length of the monothiols. Post-deposition ligand exchange by n-BT with the shortest chain length (4 C) significantly enhanced the PCE by 25.7%, from 2.18 ± 0.07% to 2.74 ± 0.10%. The degree of the PCE enhancement rapidly decreased as the alkyl chains became longer (from 4 C to 12 C). For n-DT (12 C), almost no improvement in the PCE was observed. This phenomenon can be understood if it is considered that longer alkyl chains hinder the interaction between the polymer and the nanocrystals and impede charge transport between adjacent nanocrystals, which is the case for non-electroactive surfactant capped nanocrystals.3,8

We further compared the effects of ligand treatment with a monofunctional molecule of n-BT and bifunctional molecules of EDT and mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) on the HSC performance, with the results illustrated in Fig. 3 and Table 1. These results show that the performance of the device treated by monofunctional n-BT is obviously better than those treated by bifunctional EDT and MPA. In the case of bulk heterojunction HSCs, nanocrystals are dispersed in the polymer matrix. Therefore, unlike all-inorganic nanocrystal solar cells, where the nanocrystals are tightly packed, the chance to link the two functional groups respectively to two nanocrystals is greatly reduced in HSCs. We speculate that one of the functional groups from the bifunctional molecules dangles outside the surface of the nanocrystals and may negatively affect the exciton dissociation and charge transport. However, as for monofunctional molecules, their functional groups could easily link to the nanocrystal surface and be stabilized, while their alkyl chains could be compatible with the polymer chains and be beneficial for the interaction. Consequently, it's reasonable that monofunctional n-BT will have a better performance than those bifunctional molecules. Based on our experiments, we believe monofunctional ligands with short chains should be more suitable in the post-deposition process of HSCs.

To gain a deeper understanding of the origin of the performance improvement of the HSCs after post-deposition ligand exchange by n-BT, we investigated the effect of the ligand exchange on the absorption, morphology and electron mobility of P3HT:CdSe QD blend films. Fig. 4 compares the absorption of P3HT:CdSe QD blend films before and after n-BT treatment. It is observed that the absorption of the blend films in the range of 300–350 and 640–700 nm is similar, while in the range of 470–640 nm, the absorption of the blend film after treatment is slightly lower than that before treatment. Hence, the improved photovoltaic performance is not likely to be caused by the absorption of the blend films.

TEM images of the blend films before and after post-deposition ligand exchange by n-BT are shown in Fig. 5 (TEM images with the same and lower magnification are also presented in Fig. S3 (ESI†)). No obvious changes in phase separation were observed in the film after n-BT treatment. CdSe QDs were still dispersed relatively uniformly in the film and not aggregated into bigger domains. In previous reports, it was believed that post-deposition ligand exchange by bifunctional molecules, such as EDT and BDT, could cause cross-linking between quantum dots, thus forming domains of quantum dots. The aggregation and phase separation could significantly influence the physical interactions between the nanocrystals and the polymer chains, leading to improved charge separation and transport in the blend film.11,21 However, in our work, the blend film showed no noticeable changes in phase separation after n-BT treatment. So, the enhancement of the JSC and PCE may not be attributed to the aggregation or a change in phase separation.

We further studied the electron mobility in P3HT:CdSe QD blend films before and after post-deposition ligand exchange via the space–charge limited current (SCLC) measurement. Fig. 6 shows the J–V characteristics of electron-only devices of Al/P3HT:CdSe/Al. The electron mobility is obtained by fitting the J–V characteristics according to Child's Law.20 We note that the electron mobility of the blend film increases by five orders of magnitude from (1.17 ± 0.43) × 10−9 cm2 (V s)−1 to (2.23 ± 0.39) × 10−4 cm2 (V s)−1 after n-BT treatment. The enhanced electron mobility is consistent with the increase of the JSC and FF and, consequently, the PCE of the HSCs. Obviously, the improved photovoltaic performance of the HSCs with n-BT treatment results from the much higher electron mobility. This could be further verified by the device treated by n-DT, which showed a much lower electron mobility of μe = (1.19 ± 0.71) × 10−8 cm2 (V s)−1, which is comparable to that of the blend film before post-deposition ligand exchange and is consistent with the low JSC and PCE. Moreover, the electron mobility of the blend film treated with EDT (μe = (4.10 ± 2.85) × 10−5 cm2 (V s)−1) and MPA (μe = (3.31 ± 0.69) × 10−6 cm2 (V s)−1) are also lower than that of the blend film treated with n-BT. This correlates with the poor performance of EDT- and MPA-treated devices. As a result, we argue that the improvement of the electron mobility mainly accounts for the elevation of the PCE of the HSCs with our post-deposition treatment.

The enhancement of the electron mobility is related to the surface properties of the CdSe QDs, which was investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Fig. 7 shows the FTIR spectra of the as-synthesized CdSe QDs as well as the ligand-treated CdSe QD films. The change of the ligand on the surface of CdSe QDs can be clearly characterized from the FTIR spectra. After pyridine treatment, the intensities of the peaks, which can be attributed to C–H (at 2924, 2857 cm−1), CO (at 1718 cm−1) and C–P (at 1260 cm−1) stretching vibrations, dramatically decreased, demonstrating the removal of trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) and oleic acid surfactants, which exist on the surface of the as-prepared QDs. The inset in Fig. 7 shows, in more detail, a section of the FTIR spectrum of the MPA-treated CdSe QDs. The broad peak around 3500 cm−1 can be ascribed to the dangling –COOH or water, but not exclusively to the –COOH. The –SH moiety is so weak in the FTIR spectrum that we cannot find its signal. After post-deposition ligand exchange by thiols, these peaks were much weaker, confirming the ligand exchange reaction on the surface of the CdSe QDs. Since pyridine has a weak affinity for the CdSe QDs, after pyridine treatment, most of the X-type ligands, such as oleic acid and some L-type ligands, such as trioctylphosphine (TOP), TOPO and TOP-Se, are still on the surface of the CdSe QDs.30 These insulating ligands prevent the desired charge transport in the photovoltaics and could be replaced by thiols due to the higher affinity of –SH for Cd2+.24

In conclusion, we demonstrated the high-performance of P3HT:CdSe QD hybrid solar cells fabricated via post-deposition ligand exchange by monothiol n-BT. The devices show a PCE as high as 3.09%. This value is the highest among HSCs based on P3HT:CdSe QD blends reported so far. Secondly, the mechanism by which ligands modify the surface structures of the CdSe QDs and, thus, improve the HSC performance was investigated. Instead of the typically used bifunctional ligands, such as dithiols, we demonstrated that monofunctional ligands, such as monothiol n-BT with short chains, are significantly better at improving the efficiency of HSCs through enhancing the charge transport between the nanocrystals. As such, this work provides new scope for HSC optimization and the understanding of ligand-exchange mechanisms.
