    , Accepted 19th June 2014First published on 20th June 2014AbstractA simple, safe, and clean molecular precursor-based solution method was developed to fabricate a Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 absorber layer. Low-cost and versatile thioacetic acid was deployed as an effective solvent and suitable sulfur source to dissolve the starting materials, generating a high power conversion efficiency of 8.6% in the final cell.
Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGSSe) is regarded as the next generation photovoltaic material, as the maximal conversion efficiency of the CIGSSe solar cell has been more than 20%.1–8 Generally, the fabrication of the CIGSSe absorber layer often involves high-cost vacuum deposition approaches, such as multistage co-evaporation,7–9 alloy sputtering,10–12etc.13 The investment of expensive vacuum equipment hinders mass-production of large-area cells. Therefore, it is highly necessary to explore an economical method to prepare CIGSSe solar cells for commercial utilization. A solution-based non-vacuum process is a facile, low-cost and high-throughput method that is becoming a preferred alternative for fabricating cost-efficient CIGSSe solar cells.
Nanoparticle-based ink methods, as one important category of solution-based deposition methods, have received extensive attention.14–19 However, the complicated nanoparticle synthesis and purification process leads to great challenges for large-scale production and reproduction. Moreover, some difficult problems still need to be solved in order to manufacture high efficiency photovoltaic devices, for example, element stoichiometry control and long-term ink stability. Molecular precursor-based solution approaches, another effective solution-based method for fabricating thin film solar cells, are becoming favorable due to their simple fabrication processes, high yield, precise chemical composition control, superior uniformity in films, and low annealing temperature.20–27 Among the molecular precursor methods, the hydrazine-based method has obtained great success with the highest efficiency (15.2%), which is comparable to the maximal efficiency value (20.4%).8,22 Despite the notable device efficiency, the high toxicity and explosive nature of hydrazine make the deposition process more complex and dangerous. It is better to explore alternative facile, green, and economical methods without hydrazine to acquire a solar cell with excellent photovoltaic performance.
In our previous research, we utilized a facile and low-toxic molecular precursor-based solution method to prepare CuIn(S,Se)2 (CISSe) thin films.28 However, the efficiency of CISSe-based solar cells is relatively low. Device performance can be improved by the insertion of Ga, which can effectively adjust the band gap and thus the electrical property of the absorber.29 Good quality Ga insertion is the guarantee of high efficiency solar cells, which would be attainable with (a) suitable Ga content at approximately 30%, (b) v-shaped distribution of Ga in the depth profile, and (c) large-scale uniformity, which are not easy tasks to fulfill. Herein, we further developed this solution method using Ga(acac)3 as the Ga source and investigated the photovoltaic properties of CIGSSe solar cells. Versatile thioacetic acid was utilized as the solvent and sulfur source to dissolve the starting materials (Cu2O, In(OH)3, and Ga(acac)3) with the aid of ammonia, formed a transparent, uniform, volatile, and air-stable precursor solution.28,30,31 A high-quality CIGSSe absorber with large crystal grains was obtained after spin-coating and the selenization process. As-fabricated CIGSSe solar cells, with the absorber layer only approximately 766 nm thickness, yielded a high power conversion efficiency of 8.6%, which showed significant boosts as compared to what was obtained in our previous work.28 By increasing the thickness of the CIGSSe layer, a higher efficiency will be obtained, and our laboratory research is currently in progress to attain this goal.
The fabrication process of the CIGSSe solar cell is displayed in Fig. 1. Innovatively, a novel solution precursor (orange-red and transparent) was prepared by dissolving low-cost starting materials (Cu2O, In(OH)3 and Ga(acac)3) in the air at room temperature. Then, an as-fabricated CIGS thin film was obtained by spinning the precursor solution onto the Mo/glass substrate before heating at 300 °C to eliminate the organic solvents. Finally, CIGSSe absorber was prepared by annealing the as-fabricated CIGS thin film in a Se atmosphere at 500 °C for 30 minutes. The final CIGSSe solar cells were completed by the deposition of CdS, i-ZnO, Al-doped ZnO (AZO) layers, and an Ag grid in sequence.32 Compared with the toxic and dangerous hydrazine-based deposition approach, this method is much simpler, safer, and cleaner.

Thioacetic acid (CH3COSH) has played a crucial role in the process of dissolving metal precursors.28,30,31 Soluble and stable metal complexes are formed owing to the strong coordination ability of S in thioacetic acid, which coordinates with metal ions. If starting materials react with thioacetic acid alone, sulfide precipitation forms instead of the formation of clear precursor solution. The addition of alkali enables the strong coordination ability of S, which will draw off the H in –SH. Herein, ammonia was chosen because of its high volatility, resulting in clean films. The detailed reactions between the starting materials and thioacetic acid are listed below:   
The N in ammonia was not considered the dominant ligand to coordinate with metal ions because the dissolution could also be realized by the utilization of NaOH instead of ammonia. The FTIR spectra of Cu, In, and Ga precursor are shown in Fig. S1† (in the ESI†). The vibration peak shift of CO and C–S indicated that thioacetic acid coordinated with different metal ions. The obvious spectra difference of Ga precursor should be due to the existence of acetylacetone. In addition, thioacetic acid is easily evaporated due to its low boiling point (93 °C), and this process will remove all impurities from the thin films. The precursor solution was stable for three months at −4 °C, indicating its long-term stability.

Fig. 2a shows the XRD patterns of the CIGS and CIGSSe layers. Weak and broad peaks of CIGS are shown, indicating the formation of the CIGS phase before annealing. Sharp peaks with high intensity were observed and well indexed to CIGSSe (112), (220) and (312) after selenization, demonstrating the complete crystallization of the absorber. The peaks shifted to lower theta values after annealing, indicating the insertion of Se in the lattice points. The Raman spectra of the CIGS and CIGSSe layers are shown in Fig. 2b. The peak at 297 cm−1 was indexed to typical molecular vibrations of CIGS before annealing. After annealing, the strong Raman peak of CIGSe was found at 184 cm−1 while the CIGS peak shifted to 295 cm−1, implying the formation of CIGSSe.33,34 As we can see from the full Raman spectra (Fig. S2†), no carbon peak at 1500 cm−1 was detected after annealing, indicating that the carbon was completely removed in the final CIGSSe thin films. The line-scan energy disperse spectra (EDS) analysis is shown in Fig. S3,† illustrating the uniform element distribution in the depth profile and carbon-free thin films.

During the selenization process, not only was CIGSSe synthesized, but evolution of the microstructure, the grain size and the composition occurred. Fig. 3a shows a top-view FESEM image of the selenized CIGSSe layer, indicating a compact thin film with large crystal grains without any cracks or holes. As shown in Fig. S4 in the ESI,† the spin-coated CIGS film with an area approximately 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm possessed a very smooth surface. A cross-sectional FESEM image is displayed in Fig. 3b. It is obvious that large grains in the absorber layer extend across the thin film and exhibit dimensions close to 1 μm, which favours the depression of hole-electron recombination. The thickness of the CIGSSe layer was determined to be 766 nm with a 923 nm Mo substrate underneath. Furthermore, EDS was measured, and the corresponding result is given in Fig. S5 in the ESI.† The ratios of Cu/(Ga + In), Ga/(In + Ga), and S/(Se + S) were determined to be 0.76, 0.29 and 0.22, respectively.

Fig. 4a displays the photovoltaic performance of the fabricated CIGSSe solar cell under a standard simulated AM 1.5 illumination at 100 mW cm−2. The fabricated CIGSSe cell yielded an efficiency (η) of 8.6% with short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) = 24.69 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage (Voc) = 611 mV, and fill factor (FF) = 0.57. The series resistance (Rs) and shunt conductance (Gsh) were determined to be 8.2 Ω cm2 and 2.86 mS cm−2, respectively. The average power conversion efficiency of the top 10 devices was 8.23%, and detailed information for these 10 devices is shown in Table S1.† However, the Jsc was relatively smaller than that of the reported high conversion efficiency CIGSSe solar cell (>32 mA cm−2).7,8,22 This is mainly due to the thinner absorber thickness (766 nm), which was much smaller than the optimal value (2 μm). It is highly possible that increasing the absorber thickness could achieve more light harvesting and improve the Jsc. In addition, lowering the bulk resistance of the Mo, CIGSSe, and AZO layers and improving the interface contact resistance between adjacent layers are other ways to further enhance the Jsc. However, the Gsh was higher than in our previous report, which may be caused by the existence of leak current. Adjustment of the absorber composition to prevent the formation of Cu2−xSe and improve the absorber quality could reduce leak current, resulting in higher Voc and FF. Fig. 4b depicts the external quantum efficiency spectra (EQE) of the CIGSSe solar cell. The quantum efficiency was more than 70% in the range between 550 nm and 800 nm. The calculated Jsc from the EQE spectra was 23.82 mA cm−2, which was very close to the directly measured Jsc under the standard simulated AM 1.5 illumination. As shown in the inset, the band gap of the CIGSSe thin film was determined by plotting (E × EQE)2 (in which E was the incident photon energy) versus photon energy.26,27 The fitted band gap was approximately 1.19 eV, which is close to some previous reports.7,26 Compared with our early CISSe work, Ga insertion led to an increase in bandgap from 1.09 eV to 1.19 eV. In addition, the Voc was enhanced from 0.443 V to 0.611 V, and the FF increased from 0.50 to 0.57, resulting in improved device performance.

Conclusions
In summary, high quality CIGSSe thin films were successfully prepared by a green, facile, and low-cost molecular precursor-based solution method using thioacetic acid as the solvent and sulfur source. Large crystal grains (approximately 1 μm) were obtained in the crystalline CIGSSe absorber layer with a thickness of approximately 766 nm. A high power conversion efficiency of 8.6% was achieved in the corresponding fabricated CIGSSe solar cell. It is highly possible that better photovoltaic performance can be realized in cells with thicker CIGSSe films, and work towards this goal is still in progress in our laboratory. High-quality insertion of Ga by Ga(acac)3 is successful in this thioacetic acid-based solution method; thus this technique shows great potential for achieving improvements in efficiency and for a bright future in mass production.
