    , Accepted 7th June 2016First published on 9th June 2016AbstractOrganolead halide perovskites exhibit superior photoelectric properties, which have given rise to the perovskite-based solar cells whose power conversion efficiency has rapidly reached above 20% in the past few years. However, perovskite-based solar cells have also encountered problems such as current–voltage hysteresis and degradation under practical working conditions. Yet investigations into the intrinsic chemical nature of the perovskite material and its role on the performance of the solar cells are relatively rare. In this work, Raman spectroscopy is employed together with CASTEP calculations to investigate the organic–inorganic interactions in CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbBr3−xClx perovskite single crystals with comparison to those having ammonic acid as the cations. For Raman measurements of CH3NH3PbI3, a low energy line of 1030 nm is used to avoid excitation of strong photoluminescence of CH3NH3PbI3. Raman spectra covering a wide range of wavenumbers are obtained, and the restricted rotation modes of CH3–NH3+ embedded in CH3NH3PbBr3 (325 cm−1) are overwhelmingly stronger over the other vibrational bands of the cations. However, the band intensity diminishes dramatically in CH3NH3PbBr3−xClx and most of the bands shift towards high frequency, indicating the interaction with the halides. The details of such an interaction are further revealed by inspecting the band shift of the restricted rotation mode as well as the C–N, NH3+ and CH3 stretching of the CH3NH3+ as a function of Cl composition and length of the cationic ammonic acids. The results show that the CH3NH3+ interacts with the PbX3− octahedral framework via the NH3+ end through N+–H⋯X hydrogen bonding whose strength can be tuned by the composition of halides but is insensitive to the size of the organic cations. Moreover, an increase of the Cl content strengthens the hydrogen bonding and thus blueshifts the C–N stretching bands. This is due to the fact that Cl is more electronegative than Br and an increase of the Cl content decreases the lattice constant of the perovskite. The findings of the present work are valuable in understanding the role of cations and halides in the performance of MAPbX3-based perovskite solar cells.
Introduction
Solar cells based on organolead halide perovskite have received unprecedented attention since the first report on the liquid perovskite-based dye sensitized solar cell in 2009.1–6 Rapid and substantial increases of power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solid-state perovskite solar cells with considerable durability have been achieved above 20%,6–8 making the perovskite-based solar cell promising for practical applications. The superior performance of the perovskite solar cells benefit from the unique structural and electronic properties of the perovskite materials associated with high optical absorption coefficient and ambipolar conductivity.9,10 For the typical halide perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) with a tetragonal phase at room temperature, the MA+ cations are located in the interstices of the PbI3− octahedral framework. Although the cations do not directly contribute to the formation of the valence and conduction band structure,11,12 their orientation and thus the created dipole in the framework are closely related to the dielectricity13 and ferro-/antiferroelectricity of the perovskite,14–16 while their rotation can lower the exciton binding energy of perovskites and favor the separation and transportation of electrons and holes.17 Depending on the size, geometry and the embedding manner of the cations, distortion of the octahedral framework can occur, which affects the spatial symmetry and thermal stability of the perovskite structure. Recent studies on the current–voltage hysteresis present severely in planar structured perovskite solar cells have shown that molecular level ferroelectricity14,18,19 and migration20–22 of the cations23,24 under an external electric field may be responsible although the exact origins are still under debate.25 In any case, cation migration would be detrimental to and lead to the degradation of the solar cell.23 Hence the role of the cations in the perovskites is two-folded: on the one hand, cation dipole and rotation will modify the electronic structure and lower the exciton energy, which are desirable for good photovoltaic performance; on the other hand, the distortion of the octahedral framework and the migration of the cation can cause undesirable instability of the crystal structure. As a result, it brings the opportunity to improve the photovoltaic performance of the solar cell by optimizing the geometry and chemical structure of the cations.
It is important to note that the behavior of the cations in the inorganic framework is strongly dependent on the microenvironment of organic–inorganic interactions, and investigation on the interactions between the MA+ and the PbI3− in the octahedral framework would in turn be beneficial for understanding the cation influence on the performance of the solar cells. The research into this aspect is emerging and becoming hot topic in the last couple of years. Vibrational spectroscopies including IR26–28 and Raman,27,29–33 neutron diffraction17,34 and NMR35 have been employed together with theoretical calculations,11,13,27,36 focusing on the cation dynamics in the lattice by analyzing the rotational and vibrational modes of the cations. A number of Raman spectroscopic studies on MAPbI3 have been reported,27,29–33 but are mostly limited to the low wavenumber region associated with lattice dynamics of MAPbI3.29–33 The Raman spectrum covering a wide range of wavenumbers has been obtained only for the orthorhombic γ phase of MAPbI3 at 100 K.27 Although the information obtained from these Raman spectroscopic investigations have helped in identifying the chemical composition of the perovskite and elucidating the structure and stability of the perovskite, the lack of high wavenumber spectra in most of the studies and the observation of the rotation mode in the low wavenumber region as suggested by the work of neutron diffraction17,33 hinder the detailed analysis of cation interactions with the microenvironment of the inorganic framework. (We note that during the preparation of this manuscript there appears a paper on Raman spectroscopic study on MAPbI3 and several Br and Cl substituted perovskites covering a wide range of wavenumbers37.) Moreover, all of the Raman spectroscopic studies reported so far were carried out on planar or mesostructured films, and the quality of the perovskites and thus the quality of Raman spectra can vary diversely depending on the preparation conditions. This poses difficulties for quantitative analysis and comparisons of results among different perovskites and different groups.
In this work, we present a systematic Raman spectroscopic study on the organic–inorganic interactions using single crystalline halide perovskites. Single crystal perovskites have fewer defects in the bulk, which are expected to ensure the best achievable photoelectric properties of the perovskite.38–40 In addition, they are more stable against water, oxygen and photo-induced heating. Use of single crystalline perovskites would enable Raman spectroscopic investigations in the absence of the interference from structural disorder, which is beneficial to data analysis and comparisons. In the framework of this paper, we perform a comparative wide-range wavenumber Raman spectroscopic investigation on single crystalline MAPbI3, MAPbBr3 and MAPbBr3−xClx perovskites to understand the orientation and rotation behaviors of the MA+ cation and the interactions of the MA+ cation with the PbX3− anions. A theoretical calculation of the Raman spectrum of MABr powder is performed to guide in the assignment of the Raman bands. Finally, the investigation of halide perovskites with ammonic acid of varying length as the cations is carried out to further elucidate the role of cations.
Experimental
Materials
The following chemicals were used as received: methylammonium iodide (≥99.5%), methylammonium bromide (≥99.5%), lead iodide (PbI2) (99.999%), lead bromide (PbBr2), γ-butyrolactone (GBL), and DMF were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich while amino acids were from Aladdin Industrial Inc. The MAPbBr3−xClx single crystals were synthesized by heating the DMF precursor solution containing PbBr2 and [(1−x)CH3NH3Br + xCH3NH3Cl] at 50 °C for several hours as reported previously.41 For the synthesis of MAPbI3, 1.23 M PbI2 and MAI were dissolved in GBL at 50 °C. After being fully dissolved, the solution was heated to 100 °C overnight to grow single crystals. Ammonic acid based perovskites were prepared by spin-coating the precursor solution of ammonic acid bromide and PbBr2 at a molar ratio of 2:1 onto a cleaned FTO glass at a speed of 6000 rpm for 15 s.
Spectroscopic measurements
UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Cary 5000 UV-VIS-NIR-spectrometer. A photoluminescence spectrum was measured on an XPLORA Raman instrument using a 638 nm excitation line. Raman measurements were conducted on an XPLORA Raman spectrometer (Jobin-Yvon, France) with excitation lines of 532 and 638 nm depending on the use. Laser power density was ca.1.5 and 2.1 mW for 532 and 638 nm, respectively. Optical grating of 1200 T was used. For Raman measurements of MAPbI3 single crystals, an inspector 1030 instrument purchased from SciapsDeltaNu (America) was employed. The Raman spectra of perovskite single crystals were recorded in dry air while those of ammonic acid based perovskite films were protected by argon in a closed cell.
Calculation details for Raman spectra of MABr solid
All the structural optimization and energy calculations were carried out by the CASTEP module in Materials Studios 7.0 as a licensed product of BIOVIA. The MABr structure was constructed on the basis of the crystal structures and adjusted to follow the C2v symmetry in a primitive cell of C-centred orthorhombic lattice. The built structure was fully optimized using the generalized gradient approximation treated by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof potential. Norm-conserving pseudopotentials were used and represented in reciprocal space. The self-consistent field (SCF) procedure was used with a convergence threshold of 10−5 au on the energy and electron density. Geometry optimizations were performed with a convergence threshold of 0.03 eV Å−1 on the max force, 0.05 Gpa on the max stress, and 0.001 Å on the max displacement. Energy cutoff was set to be 700 eV, and the Brillouin zone was sampled by 3 × 3 × 2 k-points using the Monkhorst–Pack scheme. Raman intensities were calculated based on the crystal system type and fitted to a Lorentzian distribution to generate the spectra.
Results and discussion
The MAPbI3 perovskite has a tetragonal structure with an optical absorption coefficient reaching up to 104 cm−1 in the wavelength range from 400 to 750 nm. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows photographs of different kinds of MAPbX3 perovskite single crystals in which MAPbI3 appears in dark black color as a result of the strong optical absorption of the high quality single crystals. The UV-vis absorption spectrum and photoluminescence (PL) of a solution-grown MAPbI3 single crystal are shown in Fig. 1A, and it can be seen that the absorption edge extends to around 800 nm, which coincides with the photoluminescence maximum and would result in a strong fluorescence background on Raman spectra in the visible region. Even if a 532 nm laser, which is far from the PL maximum, is used, the strong fluorescence can still be excited, making it difficult to obtain a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio for Raman measurements. Furthermore, the green 532 nm laser has higher energy, which is easier to cause the degradation of perovskite into PbI2. For this reason, the Raman spectra of the MA+ in the perovskite have been rarely reported previously. To overcome such problems, we used 1030 nm laser excitation for the Raman study of the MAPbI3 single crystal. High signal-to-ratio Raman spectra covering a wavenumber range from 150 to 2450 cm−1 are obtained as shown in Fig. 1B (red line). For comparison, the Raman spectrum of the MAI powder is also provided (black line). Most of the Raman bands of MA+ on the spectrum of MAPbI3 also appear in the spectrum of the MAI powder, except 275 and 1250 cm−1.

The bands at 914, 989, 1460, 1540 and 1604 cm−1 of the MAI powder are all red-shifted to 909, 956, 1426, 1469, and 1583 cm−1, respectively, in the MAPbI3 crystal, which suggests that the MA+ cation in MAPbI3 interacts strongly with the inorganic PbI3− framework, not only by electrostatic attractions but also by chemical interactions, which induces the chemical Stark effect. This chemical interaction between the organic cation and the inorganic framework will be discussed in detail by Raman analysis of MAPbBr3−xClx later. The low frequency band at 275 cm−1 is related to the restricted rotation of the MA+ in MAPbI3. It is known that the free MA+ rotates fast at room temperature but the rotation mode is Raman and IR inactive. However, for the embedded MA+ in the MAPbI3, it experiences unequal environment during rotation, which breaks the average crystal symmetry of the PbI3− octahedral framework so that the rotation mode becomes Raman active under a restricted condition. Chen et al.17 investigated MA+ rotation dynamics of MAPbI3 in orthorhombic, tetragonal and cubic phases by an elastic and quasi-elastic neutron scattering technique. They concluded that at room temperature the tetragonal phase MA+ in the cage of the PbI3− framework exhibits four-fold rotational symmetry of the C–N axis (C4 mode) and three-fold rotation around the C–N axis (C3 mode). On the other hand, Brivio et al. predicted based on first-principles lattice dynamics that the rotation mode of the CH3 unit against the NH3 unit in the tetragonal MAPbI3 is around 300 cm−1 at room temperature. But this band was not observed in their Raman experiments even at 100 K, excited by the 785 nm laser. In the present work, the restricted rotation of the MA+ appears at 275 cm−1, in agreement with the calculated one by Brivio et al., and therefore we attribute the band to the restricted rotation of the CH3 unit against the NH3 unit around the C–N axis (i.e. the C3 mode noted by Chen et al.17).
In order to investigate the nature of the organic–inorganic interaction in MAPbX3 perovskites and its impact on the stability and degradation of perovskites, we performed Raman experiments together with theoretical calculations on the MAPbBr3 single crystal and its precursors. Fig. 2 shows the Raman spectra of the MAPbBr3 single crystal (blue line) and MABr powder (red line) in the region 500–3500 cm−1. A similar chemical Stark effect occurs when the MA+ is embedded into the PbBr3− framework. Also given is the calculated Raman spectrum of the MABr solid (black line), which agrees well with the experimentally measured one in terms of the band number and position. Detailed assignments and analysis of the bands related to MA+ in MABr and thus in the MAPbBr3 single crystal are provided in Table 1.

In the intermediate wavenumber region of the spectrum of MAPbBr3, the sharp and intense bands at 970 and 1480 cm−1 are from the C–N stretching and NH3+ asymmetric bending, respectively. They are significantly red-shifted compared to those in the MABr powder sample, which serves as an indication of strong interaction from the inorganic framework. However, the two rocking modes at 922 and 1249 cm−1 only show slight yet opposite trends of frequency variation compared with the calculated ones. Moreover, the clearly observed rocking mode at 1249 cm−1 and the twisting mode (NH3+) at 1593 cm−1 in the single crystal MAPbBr3 perovskite are either too weak to be detected or appear as a weak shoulder in the MABr powder. This indicates that the vibrational modes of the MA+ cation are highly sensitive to the microenvironment.
In the high wavenumber region, the νsym(CH3) at 2893 and νasym(CH3) at 2971 do not shift for the embedded MA+ while the νsym(N+–H) at 2832 cm−1 is blue-shifted and the broad νsym(NH3+) at 3059 cm−1 in the MABr power splits into 3044, 3128, 3189 cm−1 in the MAPbBr3 crystal, exhibiting the red or blueshift compared to the MABr powder as shown in Table 1. In other words, the chemical interactions between the organic cation and the inorganic framework take place through the NH3+ end of the MA+. The splitting of the νsym(NH3+) at 3059 cm−1 is most likely due to the hydrogen bonding with the halides in the form of N+–H⋯X.
To clarify the cation–halide interaction, we performed Raman measurements on MAPbBr3−xClx (x = 0, 0.25, 0.33, 0.5) single crystals. Raman spectra are shown in Fig. 3A, and we focus on and correlate the restricted rotation of MA+ in the low wavenumber region and the stretching of C–N in the high wavenumber region and their dependency on halides. For the MAPbBr3 single crystal, the MA+ restricted rotation mode at 325 cm−1 is overwhelmingly stronger over the other bands in the whole spectral region. Note that this mode is not observed in PbBr2 and CH3NH3Br, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), excluding the possibility of the band arising from the lattice liberation given that the lattice liberation in MAPbBr3 and PbBr2 would appear with a similar Raman shift if any.
 Fig. 3  Raman spectra of MAPb3−xClx single crystals in full range (A) and of the C–N stretching mode (B), asym. NH3+ bending and NH3+ twisting (C), C–H stretching (D), and the relative intensity of the 325 cm−1 band with different Cl contents (E). 
It is seen that doping with Cl as low as x = 0.25 substantially diminishes the intensity of the MA+ restricted rotation mode, while the intensity of the other bands remains almost unchanged; and the band shift from 325 cm−1 of the MAPbBr3 single crystal to 333 cm−1 of MAPbBr2.5Cl0.5 single crystals (Fig. 3B). The same trend for the blueshift is found for the C–N stretching and NH3+ twisting of MA+ from 970 and 1592 cm−1 in MAPbBr3 to 973 and 1597 cm−1 in MAPbBr2.5Cl0.5, respectively. Nevertheless, the Raman shift of the C–H stretching mode changes only slightly from 2971 cm−1 in MAPbBr3 to 2972 cm−1 in MAPbBr2.5Cl0.5. This means that halides play the role in the change of the microenvironment of the PbX3− framework, and the bands associated with NH3+ are more sensitive to the inorganic microenvironment via hydrogen bonding of N+–H⋯X. The blueshift of the C–N stretching and NH3+ twisting observed in the present work agrees with the result obtained from the IR spectroscopic study of Glaser et al. It was reported that there exists medium to strong hydrogen bonding in MAPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) perovskites at room temperature, but surprisingly the bonding strength differs little among the three halide perovskites.25 Here the blueshift of the C–N stretching mode of MA+ indicates the strengthening of the Cl interaction because Cl is more electronegative than Br and doping of Cl is accompanied by the reduction of lattice constant of the perovskite.41
As for the influence of the cation size on the restricted rotation, an increase of the cation size by simple addition of more methyl units is expected to increase the activation energy of C4 mode substantially while maintaining that of C3 mode less affected. In other words, the band frequency would remain almost unchanged if a C3 rotation mode is involved in the present work. To study the cation effect, perovskites having ammonic acid as the cations are employed for Raman measurements. These perovskites were synthesized using MABr and alkyl ammonic acid with different carbon chain lengths, i.e., 3C for β-alanice, 4C for aminobutyric acid and 5C for aminovaleric acid, whose molecular structures are shown in Fig. 4B. We mention that when the cation size becomes larger,43 the 2D-structured perovskites expressed in the formula of A2MX4 are formed but the perovskite connectivity (through corner sharing) is still retained.44 Nevertheless, the ammonic acid cations still interact with the PbBr3− framework via the NH3+ end. Fig. 4A shows the Raman spectra of the ammonic acid-based perovskites. We find that the restricted rotational band around 325 cm−1 observed for MAPbBr3 remains almost unchanged after replacing the MA+ with the ammonic acid regardless of its length. This excludes the C4 mode and thus confirms the observed band at 325 cm−1 to be the C3 type of the restricted rotation mode in the present work.

These results suggest that the hydrogen bonding between the amine group and the halides in the perovskite structure (N+–H⋯X) governs the organic–inorganic chemical interplay, and thus dictates the three-fold rotation dynamics of the organic cation along the C–N axis. This hydrogen bonding together with the cation–anion electrostatic attraction makes up the overall organic–inorganic interaction in these perovskites. This explains why the band gap and photovoltaic performance of halide perovskites can be successively tuned by varying the composition of the mixed cation/anion perovskites.6,45 For MAPbI3, the MA+ might be slightly smaller if measured by the tolerance factor for best perovskites. Thus use of a larger cation like HC[NH2]2+ or partially replacing I by Br or Cl can somehow strengthen the overall organic–inorganic interaction and thus improves the stability of these perovskite materials. The current–voltage hysteresis is observed in most of MAPbI3 based perovskite solar cells but greatly reduced in MAPbBr3 based perovskite solar cells.46 While ferroelectric effects due to the existence of oriented MA domains under applied bias have been suggested,14,16,18 Beilsten-Edmands et al. have recently reported non-ferroelectric nature of the conductance hysteresis in MAPbI3 perovskite-based photovoltaic devices.25,47 Despite the debates, the proposed restricted rotation of the MA+ cation upon doping of the Cl− is in favor of the opinion of the cation involvement of the current–voltage hysteresis in MAPbX3 perovskite solar cells.
Conclusions
We have studied organic–inorganic interactions of halide perovskites by systematic Raman spectroscopic measurements on MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3−xClx single crystals in comparison to those having ammonic acid as the cations. An overall red shift of the Raman bands of MA+ is observed in MAPbI3 perovskite compared with that in the MAI powder, indicating chemical interactions between MA+ and PbI3−. The restricted rotation mode of CH3–NH3+ is confirmed to be the C3 type along the C–N axis. The intensity of this mode in the MAPbBr3 single crystals is overwhelmingly stronger than the other bands of the cations, but diminishes dramatically with a slight shift towards high wavenumber upon increased doping of Cl− in MAPbBr3−xClx. On the other hand, while the C–N stretching shows a slight band shift, the stretching of CH3 is affected by neither the doping of Cl− nor the replacement of cations with the ammonic acid of varying length. These results lead to a conclusion that the interactions of the organic cation with the inorganic PbX3− framework are fulfilled mainly via the NH3+ end through N+–H⋯X hydrogen bonding. The strength of the interaction can be tuned by the composition of halides but is insensitive to the size of the organic cation. Moreover, doping of Cl− with higher electronegativity strengthens the hydrogen bonding. The present work has demonstrated that Raman spectroscopic measurements can provide fingerprint information about the details of the organic–inorganic interactions of perovskites, while the use of the single crystals of perovskites improves the quality of Raman spectra and is beneficial to accurate data analysis and comparisons.
