    , Accepted 4th January 2016First published on 12th January 2016AbstractRegulating the temperature during the direction contact and intercalation process (DCIP) for the transition from PbI2 to CH3NH3PbI3 modulated the crystallinity, crystal grain size and crystal grain orientation of the perovskite films. Higher temperatures produced perovskite films with better crystallinity, larger grain size, and better photovoltaic performance. The best cell, which had a PCE of 12.9%, was obtained on a film prepared at 200 °C. Further open circuit voltage decay and film resistance characterization revealed that the larger grain size contributed to longer carrier lifetime and smaller carrier transport resistance, both of which are beneficial for solar cell devices.
Introduction
For planar perovskite solar cells, the properties of the perovskite absorber layer, such as morphology and crystallinity, strongly affect the overall photovoltaic performance of the devices.1–11 The absorber layers of high-efficiency perovskite solar cells have the advantages of high film uniformity, high surface coverage, and being pin-hole-free. Various methods have been developed to improve the film quality by controlling crystal growth kinetics, including solvent engineering,9 fast deposition-crystallization,3 layer-by-layer vapor deposition12 and so on.1,2,4–7,11 These methods can produce compact, pin-hole-free films with good crystallinity and whole-surface coverage, which can deliver good power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, modulating the grain size (grain boundaries) of the perovskite film by these methods is difficult. Furthermore, grain boundaries produce recombination centers and degrade the solar cell performance.2,13–16 Two methods have been used to overcome the drawbacks of grain boundaries. One is passivating the grains, which can reduce the trap density and improve the photovoltaic performance.15,17 The other is enlarging the grain size of perovskite film, which can reduce the grain boundaries and decrease the density of charge traps and non-radiative recombination, increasing carrier mobility and charge collection efficiency.2,5,8,11,16,18 Theoretically, single-crystalline perovskite is the best choice because of its perfect crystallinity with no grain boundaries, which results in low trap density19–23 and excellent charge-carrier diffusion length exceeding 175 μm.19 However, no method has been developed to fabricate single crystalline perovskite films at 1 μm scale, at which the perovskite film can absorb almost all photons above its band gap. Researchers have focused on increasing the crystal size of perovskite films to reduce the number of grain boundaries.
Nie et al. used a hot casting method to obtain perovskite films with millimeter-sized grains. The large-grain perovskite film-based solar cell had a high PCE of 18%, which was ascribed to reduced carrier recombination and increased carrier mobility.16 Huang and colleagues used solvent annealing to allow grain boundary movement during heat treatment, and they produced perovskite films with a grain size slightly larger than the film thickness; conventional heat treatment produces small crystal grains (∼260 nm), smaller than the film thickness. Solvent annealing can reduce the trap density and carrier recombination rate, and improve the carrier mobility and charge carrier collection efficiency. The cell had a PCE of 15.6% with a higher FF.2 Furthermore, Huang and colleagues developed a successive drop method to modulate the grain growth and they obtained a perovskite film with grain size of around 3 μm. The crystals showed a preferred orientation along the (220) plane. After optimization, a PCE of 18.6% was obtained.5 These results show that increasing the crystal size improves the performance of perovskite-based solar cell devices.
Recently, we developed the direct contact intercalation process (DCIP)24 to prepare large, uniform perovskite films (5 × 5 cm), which can deliver a good PCE. In this work, temperature-controlled DCIP was used to adjust the crystal grain of perovskite films. The effects of temperature on the crystallinity and morphology of the perovskite film and its photovoltaic performance were investigated. The higher reaction temperature accelerated the transition rate from PbI2 to CH3NH3PbI3 and produced a perovskite film with better crystallinity, enhanced crystal orientation and larger crystal grains. The largest crystal grains of around 4.5 μm were produced at 200 °C, which delivered a highest device PCE of 12.9%.
Results and discussion
Crystallinity and absorptivity of perovskite films
Our DCIP24 was used to fabricate the perovskite films. Reaction temperature is a crucial factor in determining the crystal growth kinetics, which should also be true for DCIP. The temperature is the only parameter to be controlled and adjusted to control the reaction during DCIP. The temperature regulated the transition from PbI2 to CH3NH3PbI3 and modulated the grain size and optoelectronic properties of the perovskite film. XRD was used to monitor the effect of temperature on the reaction kinetics from PbI2 to CH3NH3PbI3 and the results are shown in Fig. S1.† The XRD peaks at 12.6° and 14.4° were assigned to (001) of the PbI2 [JCPDS card no. 07-0235] and (110) of the perovskite,6,21,25,26 respectively. For all transitions at different temperatures, the (001) peak intensity decreased while the (110) peak intensity increased as the reaction time increased. PbI2 was gradually converted to the perovskite. The reaction times for complete conversion of the PbI2 film to the perovskite film were 15, 12 and 6 min at 150, 175 and 200 °C, respectively. PbI2 diffraction peaks were not detected in the perovskite thin film. The transition time from PbI2 to CH3NH3PbI3 decreased with increasing reaction temperature from 150 to 200 °C, indicating that the conversion rate increased with the temperature.
The effect of temperature on perovskite crystallinity was determined from the XRD results for perovskite films prepared at different temperatures. Fig. 1a shows that the XRD pattern of the perovskite film is composed of the pure perovskite phase with an orthorhombic structure (14.1°, 28.4°, and 31.9°).20,21,26 The preferred orientation of perovskite films was improved as the reaction temperature increased, because the diffraction intensity ratio between (114) and (110) decreased with increasing temperature. The intensities of the (110) and (220) peaks were very strong and the other peaks nearly disappeared for the perovskite film prepared at 200 °C, demonstrating that its crystal orientation was better than the other films prepared at lower reaction temperatures. The relative intensity ratio of I(114)/I(110) decreased with the temperature (Table 1), indicating that (114) has a larger surface energy than (110). More (110) planes are exposed in the final perovskite films, reducing the surface energy.5 The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (110) diffraction peak was reduced from 0.225 to 0.212 as the temperature increased from 150 to 200 °C, indicating that the crystallinity of CH3NH3PbI3 films improved as the reaction temperature increased. These results demonstrate that the higher reaction temperature during DCIP increases the reaction rate and will benefit the crystal orientation and crystallinity of the perovskite film, which improves the optoelectronic device performance.

The light absorption properties of the samples were investigated (Fig. 1b). The light absorbance spectra for samples prepared at 150, 175 and 200 °C were identical. Because the films produced at different temperatures have same thickness, the slightly higher absorbance of perovskite film produced at 200 °C arose from its higher crystallinity.2,5 Although the reaction temperature affects the reaction rate, crystallinity and crystal orientation, it does not affect the light absorption of the perovskite films.
Surface morphology of perovskite films
The reaction temperature strongly affects the reaction rate and may alter the morphology of the obtained perovskite films during DCIP. To examine the effect of reaction temperature on the morphology of the perovskite films prepared by DCIP, they were characterized by SEM and AFM. Fig. 2 shows the surface morphology and grain size distribution of perovskite thin films prepared at 150, 175 and 200 °C. The perovskite thin film prepared by using DCIP is flat, uniform, pin-hole-free, and covers the entire substrate. Interestingly, under the same length scale, there were fewer grains and grain boundaries in the sample prepared at higher temperatures, showing that a higher reaction temperature produced larger crystal grains and fewer grain boundaries. As the temperature increased from 150 to 200 °C, the perovskite crystal size increased. The largest crystal grain was ∼4.48 μm, which was produced at 200 °C. The statistical results are summarized in Fig. 2d–f and Table 2. The average grain size increased dramatically from 0.71 to 2.19 μm, which correspond to 2- and 5-fold the film thickness, respectively, as the reaction temperature increased from 150 to 200 °C. A large grain size/film thickness ratio is crucial for perovskite film-based optoelectronic devices, because the reduced charge recombination at grain boundaries and charge carrier can be transported and collected efficiently in larger crystal grains. Solar cells based on films with larger crystal grains should have higher FF and Voc because the larger crystal grains can reduce carrier recombination and increase carrier collection efficiency.2,5,16

SEM was used to investigate the transition from PbI2 to CH3NH3PbI3 to reveal the effect of reaction temperature on the crystal growth (Fig. S2†). During the initial stage of perovskite formation, bigger perovskite crystals were formed at higher reaction temperatures (Fig. S2a, d and g†). These crystals may serve as seed crystals for perovskite growth. At the end of the transition, the films containing bigger seed crystals contained bigger crystal grains. The higher reaction temperature may induce the fast formation of perovskite and produce films containing bigger crystal grains, as reported by Nie et al.16

Fig. 3 shows AFM images of the films prepared at different temperatures. Similar to the SEM results, the reaction temperature has a strong effect on the grain size of the perovskite thin film. Higher reaction temperatures produced larger crystal grains. For reaction temperatures between 150 and 200 °C, the reaction temperature had little effect on perovskite film RMS roughness. Flat, uniform films are desirable for planar perovskite solar cell devices. However, the surface roughness of previously reported perovskite films prepared by the two-step method increased as the grain size increased.14,27

Photovoltaic performance
The perovskite films were used to assemble planar perovskite solar cells with a configuration of FTO/bl-TiO2/Perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au. Fig. 4a–c show that all devices contain 410 nm-thick perovskite films as absorber layers to exclude the effects of variation in optical absorption or interference caused by changes in film thickness. The grain boundaries in all films were perpendicular to the substrates, indicating that the carriers were transported along the device and collected with fewer encounters with grain boundaries. The photovoltaic performance of the devices was measured under simulated AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) solar irradiation in air, which was calibrated by using a certified monocrystalline silicon solar cell. The J–V curves of the best cells at each temperature are shown in Fig. 4d. For each set of conditions, 30 devices were fabricated and characterized. The statistical analysis and average parameters are summarized in Table 3 and Fig. S3.† As the reaction temperature increased from 150 to 200 °C, the average grain size increased from 0.71 to 2.19 μm, and the Jsc (from 18.60 to 20.13 mA cm−2), open-circuit voltage (Voc) (from 0.88 to 0.92 V), and fill factor (FF) (from 0.638 to 0.697) also increased, increasing the PCE from 10.5% to 12.9%. These data shown in Fig. 4 and Table 2 indicate that the larger grain size produced at higher reaction temperatures improved the photovoltaic performance of the perovskite thin film solar cell. The effect of crystal size on the J–V hysteresis was investigated (Fig. 4d and e). The device prepared at 200 °C showed the smallest difference between the forward and backward scans, indicating smaller hysteresis. According to the method reported by Park and colleagues,28 the hysteresis index was calculated. The hysteresis indexes are 0.194, 0.055 and 0.046 for the devices prepared at 150, 175 and 200 °C, respectively, demonstrating that films containing larger crystal grains had less hysteresis.28

Perovskite solar cells with a thicker absorber layer were prepared and characterized. As shown in Fig. S4,† even when the thickness of the perovskite film was increased to 600 nm, the grain boundary was still perpendicular to the substrate, which is good for change collection. The photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells with different thicknesses are summarized in Table S1.† The devices with different thickness showed similar photovoltaic performance, which was ascribed to the large crystal grains.2
The benefits of larger crystals for perovskite solar cells arise from the following factors: (1) the reduced grain boundary area associated with large grains suppresses charge trapping and recombination, and (2) larger grains allow the photogenerated carriers to propagate through the device without frequent encounters with defects and impurities. In addition to grain size, the enhanced grain orientation of the perovskite film may also improve photovoltaic performance.
It has been confirmed that grain size improves the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells. The reduced the grain boundary of the absorber layer should decrease the probability of recombination and improve Voc.

V
oc decay and resistance characterization
To evaluate the carrier recombination in the perovskite solar cells, the Voc decay test,29–31 a well-established technique for measuring the carrier recombination rate in solar cells, was used. Fig. 5a shows that the perovskite solar cell fabricated at 200 °C exhibited the longest Voc decay time compared with devices prepared at lower reaction temperatures, which indicates that the solar cell devices prepared at 200 °C have a lower carrier recombination rate and longer carrier lifetime. This result is consistent with the J–V test, which showed that the perovskite solar cell fabricated at 200 °C had the highest Voc. This result also demonstrates that higher reaction temperatures improved the perovskite solar cell performance.
 Fig. 5  (a) Voc decay curves of the perovskite solar cells and (b) the dark I–V response of perovskite thin films prepared at different temperatures. The inset is a schematic of the devices used in the dark I–V test. 
In addition to the carrier recombination properties, the charge transport properties of perovskite films were also examined. A perovskite film was deposited onto a glass substrate, and then two parallel gold electrodes were deposited on the film (Fig. 5b). The I–V response of the device was measured by using a Keithley 2400 source meter in linear sweep mode in the dark. Fig. 5b shows the linear relationship between applied voltage V and current I. The results indicate that the resistance of the perovskite film was reduced as the reaction temperature increased; the perovskite prepared at 200 °C had the smallest resistance. This was attributed to the increased grain size; as the grain size increased, the number of grain boundaries, scattering centers and traps for carriers decreased. The reduced the resistance of the perovskite film and the carrier recombination rate increased carrier collection and solar cell efficiency, consistent with the films prepared at higher temperatures having higher FF and Voc.
Conclusions
We modulated the grain size of perovskite thin film by regulating the reaction temperature during DCIP. The grain size monotonically increased with reaction temperature. The largest grain size of 4.5 μm was produced at 200 °C. The crystallinity and crystal orientation along the (110) plane were improved by increasing the reaction temperature. The photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cell showed a positive dependence on the grain size; the larger the grain size, the higher the PCE. The charge transport was increased and carrier recombination was decreased by increasing the reaction temperature, which contributed to improving the PCE of the perovskite solar cells. This work provides an insight into the improvement of perovskite solar cells by controlling the grain size of perovskite films.
Experimental
Materials
PbI2, lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI), 4-tert-butyl pyridine (tBP), chlorobenzene and acetonitrile were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Spiro-OMeTAD [2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spiro-bifluorene] was purchased form Shenzhen Feiming Technology Co. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) and isopropyl alcohol were bought from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. CH3NH3I was synthesized according to the literature.32,33
Device fabrication

Preparation of TiO2 blocking layer. 
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass (25 × 25 mm) was ultrasonically cleaned with detergent for 15 min, and then rinsed with deionized water and dried with N2. The clean substrates were spin-coated with 0.15 then 0.3 M titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (Sigma-Aldrich) at 3000 rpm for 30 s. After each spin coating process, the substrate was baked at 125 °C for 10 min, and then it was sintered at 500 °C for 30 min in air. When it was cooled to room temperature, the substrate was immersed in a 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution for 30 min at 70 °C and washed with distilled water and ethanol, followed by annealing at 500 °C for 30 min in air to form a compact n-type TiO2 blocking layer (bl-TiO2).


Growth of CH3NH3PbI3 films via DCIP. 
The 230 nm-thick PbI2 film was prepared by spin coating a 0.462 g mL−1 PbI2/DMF solution onto bl-TiO2-coated FTO at 3000 rpm, followed by annealing for 15 min on a 70 °C hotplate. A flat CH3NH3I powder layer was spread onto the bottom of an aluminum container pre-heated to 150 °C, onto which the PbI2 film was directly applied. The intercalation reaction was performed for specific durations at different temperatures (150, 175 and 200 °C) for the conversion of PbI2 to CH3NH3PbI3 in a closed container. The CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film was cooled to room temperature, and then washed with isopropyl alcohol and dried with N2. A CH3NH3PbI3 film with a thickness of 410 nm was obtained.


Assembly of perovskite film solar cells. 
A spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving spiro-OMeTAD (90 mg) in chlorobenzene (1.0 mL), into which tBP (35.8 μL) and acetonitrile Li-TFSI solution (21.7 μL, 520 mg mL−1) were added. The spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin coated onto the perovskite film at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a gold electrode with a thickness of ∼70 nm was thermally evaporated onto the spiro-MeOTAD-coated film to finish device fabrication. The active area of the device was 0.09 cm2.

Characterization
X-ray diffraction was used to monitor perovskite film formation during DCIP (XRD; DX-2700) via Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5416 Å). The absorption spectra of the CH3NH3PbI3 film on bl-TiO2-coated FTO were measured by using an UV-Vis spectrometer (Lambda 950, PerkinElmer). A field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; SU-8020, Hitachi) was used to investigate the morphology of the perovskite films. An atomic force microscope (AFM; MULTIMODE 8, Bruker) was used to image the topography and to measure surface roughness in peak force mode. The thickness of the film was measured by using a Veeco profiler (Dektak 150). The photovoltaic performance was characterized in air without encapsulation under simulated sunlight illumination generated by a solar simulator (XES-40S2-CE, San-Ei Electric, AM 1.5G filter at 100 mW cm−2), which was calibrated by using a certified silicon photodiode. J–V characteristics were obtained by using a source meter (2400, Keithley) at a sweep rate of 0.24 V s−1 in forward and backward scan mode. The resistance of the perovskite thin films deposited on glass was also tested with the source meter in the dark. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) decay curve was obtained by using a digital oscilloscope (DSO-X 2012A, Agilent) for perovskite solar cells with absorber layers prepared at different reaction temperatures.
