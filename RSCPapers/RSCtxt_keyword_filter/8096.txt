    , Accepted 25th May 2016First published on 26th May 2016AbstractSignificant improvement in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of polymer solar cells (PSCs) has been observed when the active layer was treated with a mixture of methanol and water (M:W). For the PSCs based on ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PCDTBT:PC71BM/Al, the PCE was 6.58% when the surface of the PCDTBT:PC71BM film was treated with pure methanol. However M:W (6:1) treatment on the PCDTBT:PC71BM film could further improve the PCE to 7.44% which is even higher than the PCE values of the PSCs with LiF (6.00%) or PFN (6.88%) as a cathode interlayer. Similarly in the PSCs based on ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/LiF/Al, M:W (6:1) treatment on the surface of the PTB7:PC71BM film can increase the PCE to 8.47% while the PCE values of the PSCs with methanol treatment and without any treatment on the PTB7:PC71BM film are 8.14% and 7.41%, respectively. Combined contact angle measurements and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy depth profiling demonstrated that the M:W treatments resulted in a more favorable redistribution of the polymer and PC71BM in the active layer because evaporation of the solvents drove PC71BM to migrate from the interior of the blend film to the top (air) surface.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention because of their unique characteristics such as light weight, great potential for large-area roll-to-roll fabrication and the lucrative possibility of integrating them directly into flexible devices.1–3 PSCs are commonly composed of a blend active layer of a conjugated polymer as a donor and a soluble fullerene derivative as an acceptor sandwiched between the anode and cathode. So far a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 10% has been achieved for single-junction PSCs.4–6 But there are still many factors restricting the performance of PSCs, such as limited light harvesting and low carrier mobility.7 The molecular arrangement of electron donor/acceptor materials also plays an important role in exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport which strongly impacts the performance of PSCs.8,9 To achieve high PCE, significant efforts have been dedicated to developing new p-type low band gap materials,10–12 using effective interlayers,13–15 innovating device architectures,16,17 optimizing processing methods18–20 and interface engineering.21–23 In particular interfacial modification of the cathode has attracted extensive research interest to improve the performance of PSCs by incorporating an interlayer between the active layer and cathode. A variety of interfacial materials have been utilized as cathode interlayers (CILs), such as alkali metal salts,24,25 metal chelates,26 self-assembled monolayers27 and water/alcohol soluble conjugated polymers28–30 and organic small molecules.31–33 However, the introduction of all these materials complicates the device fabrication and increases the device cost of PSCs. It is impossible to massively apply these materials as cathode interlayers for large-area roll-to-roll fabrication. Therefore it is critical to develop an effective, green and low-cost interfacial modification in PSCs. Inspiringly, several independent groups have found that the performance of PSCs could be improved simply through alcohol treatment on the active layer before the deposition of metal electrodes. A better phase separation of the conjugated polymer and fullerene derivative has been caused by the alcohol treatment on the surface of the active layer.34,35 In particular methanol treatment (MT) has shown wider applications in PSCs.36,37 Recently we reported that MT resulted in more uniform vertical distributions of the DPP copolymer and PC71BM in the blend because MT induced migration and diffusion of PC71BM from the bottom in contact with PEDOT:PSS to the top surface of the active layer.38 However volatilization of methanol is fast so that its working time for the redistribution of the donor and acceptor in the active layer is not long enough. Therefore it is necessary to increase the polarity and prolong the evaporation time of the polar solvent for the surface treatment of the active layer.
In this work, we investigate the effect of a mixture of methanol and water (M:W) on the phase separation of the active layer in PSCs. Our findings demonstrated that the vertical distribution of the polymer and PC71BM has been effectively modified by such a simple, green and cheap M:W mixture spin-coated on the surface of the active layer. When the volume ratio of methanol and water is equal to 6:1 in the mixture, a best device performance can be achieved for the PSCs based on PCDTBT (poly[N-9′′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)]):PC71BM ([6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester) and PTB7 (poly[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl) oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]-thieno[3,4-b]-thiophenediyl]):PC71BM. Contact angle measurements and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) depth profiling present that MT can lead to a better vertical redistribution of the polymer and PC71BM due to the migration of PC71BM from the bottom to the top surface during the volatilization of methanol. Adding some water into methanol can further give rise to a finer phase separation in the vertical direction because the fast volatilization of methanol is suppressed by water. These results prove that M:W treatment on the active layer is an effective, green and low-cost solution for improving the device performance of PSCs.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
PCDTBT, PTB7 and PFN (poly[9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethyl)-propyl-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)]) were purchased from 1-Material (Canada). PC71BM was obtained from American Dye Sources, Inc. All materials were used without further purification. 1,2-Dichlorobenzene (DCB), chlorobenzene (CB) and methanol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as delivered.
2.2 Fabrication of photovoltaic devices
PSCs were fabricated with a simple conventional structure. ITO substrates were pre-cleaned carefully with deionized water, acetone and isopropanol in an ultrasonic bath. Then the substrates were dried under a nitrogen flow and treated by UV-ozone for 20 minutes. A 35 nm PEDOT:PSS (Baytron PVP Al 4083) film was spin-coated on the ITO and annealed at 110 °C for 30 min. Next, 70 nm PCDTBT:PC71BM (1:4 weight ratio) from the CB:DCB (1:3) solution or 100 nm PTB7:PC71BM (1:1.5 weight ratio) from the CB:DIO (97:3) solution was spin-coated on the surface of the PEDOT:PSS layer in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. After the deposition of the photoactive layer, different solvent treatments on the surface of the active layer were carried out using methanol or M:W mixtures as shown in Scheme 1. The PSCs based on PCDTBT:PC71BM were baked at 75 °C for 10 min before a 100 nm Al film was thermally deposited in a vacuum chamber. The PSCs based on PTB7:PC71BM were stored in a vacuum about 10 hours before 0.7 nm LiF and 100 nm Al was thermally deposited in a vacuum. For comparison, PFN was also used as a CIL in the PSCs based on PCDTBT:PC71BM. A 0.2 mg mL−1 PFN solution was prepared by dilution of a 2.0 mg mL−1 solution of PFN, which was made by dissolving the polymer in methanol containing 2 vol% of acetic acid with pure methanol.39,40 About 2 nm PFN film was spin-coated on the active layer at 2000 rpm for 40 s from the 0.2 mg mL−1 PFN solution. Then Al cathodes were vacuum deposited to prepare the devices.

2.3 Measurements and characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PSCs were measured under a N2 atmosphere in the glove box by using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit under illumination and in the dark. The solar cell performance was tested under a 1 sun, AM1.5G full spectrum solar simulator (Photo Emission Tech. Inc., model #SS50AAA-GB) with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2 calibrated with a standard silicon photovoltaic traced to the National Institute of Metrology, China. Space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements were explored in the device configurations of (a) ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PCDTBT:PC71BM/ST/MoOx/Al for the hole-only device and (b) ITO/Al/LiF/PCDTBT:PC71BM/ST/LiF/Al for the electron-only device (ST: solvent treatment). External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured using a QTEST HIFINITY 5 (Crowntech Inc., USA) at room temperature in air. In addition, the static contact angles of the as-prepared surfaces were measured with a commercial contact angle system (Data Physics, OCA 20) at ambient temperature. XPS experiments were carried out using a VG Scienta R3000 spectrometer in an ultrahigh vacuum at a base pressure of 2 × 10−10 mbar. The measurement chamber was equipped with a monochromatic Al (Kα) X-ray source providing photons of 1486.6 eV. The 70 nm PCDTBT:PC71BM/ST film was etched using an ion source (ISE5, Omicron Nano Tech. GmbH). The S2p and C1s XPS spectra of the PCDTBT:PC71BM/ST film were measured after every etching with a time gap of 1 min. Ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were carried out with monochromatized He (Iα) radiation at 21.2 eV.
3. Results and discussion
The effect of M:W treatment of the PCDTBT:PC71BM blend film on the performance of PSCs has been investigated by adjusting the methanol concentration in the mixture, which is 100% (M:W = 1:0) for Device 4, 90% (M:W = 9:1) for Device 5, 86% (M:W = 6:1) for Device 6 and 75% (M:W = 3:1) for Device 7. For comparison, three control devices were fabricated, which are Device 1 without any treatment, Device 2 with 0.7 nm LiF and Device 3 with 2 nm PFN. Fig. 1a and b show the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of Devices 1–7 measured under an illumination of 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G simulated solar light and in the dark. Table 1 lists a summary of short circuit (Jsc), open circuit (Voc), fill factor (FF), power conversion efficiency (PCE), series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) derived from J–V characteristics under illumination (Fig. 1a), and rectification ratio derived from J–V characteristics in the dark (Fig. 1b). Compared to Device 1, Device 4 treated with pure methanol showed a simultaneous increase in Jsc, Voc and FF, resulting in a PCE of 6.58% which is even higher than the PCE (6.00%) of Device 2 with LiF. This indicates that MT is a more effective way to enhance the PCE than introducing LiF between Al and PCDTBT:PC71BM. When the surface of PCDTBT:PC71BM was treated with the M:W mixtures, all the Jsc, Voc and FF of the PSCs (Devices 5, 6 and 7) were further improved. As a result, the PCE values of Devices 5, 6 and 7 reached 7.23%, 7.44% and 7.13%, respectively. Device 6 based on PCDTBT:PC71BM treated with M:W = 6:1 shows the best device performance because it has higher Jsc and FF than Devices 5 and 7. In addition, the device (Device 3) with a PFN cathode interlayer exhibited a PCE of 6.88%. Obviously all the devices treated with M:W mixtures exhibited a higher PCE than Device 3 due to a higher Jsc in Devices 5–7. Therefore M:W treatment on the PCDTBT:PC71BM film is more effective to enhance the PCE than incorporating PFN as a cathode interlayer in the PSCs. Moreover the PSCs based on PCDTBT:PC71BM treated with M:W = 6:1 showed a better device stability because the PCE after 508 hours could still retain 85% of the initial PCE (Fig. S1 and S2 and Table S1†). More than 20 devices were measured for each configuration and the efficiencies were averaged. The average PCE values of Devices 1–7 are 5.41%, 5.87%, 6.66%, 6.45%, 7.10%, 7.24% and 6.98%, respectively.

The EQE spectra of Devices 1–7 from 300 nm to 800 nm were measured and are shown in Fig. 1c. The Jsc values calculated from the integration of the EQE spectra of Devices 1–7 are 10.86, 10.08, 10.94, 11.05, 11.41, 11.54 and 11.31 mA cm−2, respectively, which closely match Jsc = 11.38 mA cm−2 for Device 1 (ca. 4.57% error), Jsc = 10.54 mA cm−2 for Device 2 (ca. 4.36% error), Jsc = 11.54 mA cm−2 for Device 3 (ca. 5.20% error), Jsc = 11.61 mA cm−2 for Device 4 (ca. 4.82% error), Jsc = 12.12 mA cm−2 for Device 5 (ca. 5.86% error), Jsc = 12.29 mA cm−2 for Device 6 (ca. 6.10% error) and Jsc = 11.96 mA cm−2 for Device 7 (ca. 5.43% error) obtained from J–V characteristics under illumination. This means that the Jsc values measured for the PSCs are reliable and PCE values presented in this manuscript are not overvalued. Under illumination, Devices 5, 6 or 7 treated with M:W mixtures showed a higher Voc than the devices without (Device 1) and with (Device 4) MT. The increase in Voc can be mainly attributed to the reduced work function (WF) of the Al cathode.32 The WF values are 4.2 eV for bare Al, 3.5 eV for Al treated with methanol and 3.4 eV for Al treated with M:W = 6:1 as derived from UPS spectra in the secondary electron cut-off region (Fig. S3†). In addition, the increased Voc is consistent with the increased built-in potential across the devices. This speculation can be supported by the dark J–V characteristics of the devices in Fig. 1b. In the dark, Devices 2–7 exhibit turn-on voltages of around 1.02, 1.02 V, 1.01 V, 1.03 V, 1.03 V and 1.03 V, respectively, while the turn-on voltage of Device 1 is around 0.95 V. This suggests that the built-in voltages (Vbi) (here considered as flat-band conditions) of the devices increase when the PCDTBT:PC71BM films are treated by MT and M:W mixtures. Because Vbi influences the internal electric field in the PSCs and gives the upper limit for the Voc provided that the WF difference of the electrodes is larger than the donor HOMO–acceptor LUMO offset of the bulk heterojunction. Thus the increase of Vbi may be responsible for the increase in Voc in Devices 5–7. Compared to the devices without (Device 1) and with (Device 4) MT and even Device 2 with LiF, Devices 5, 6 and 7 treated with the M:W mixtures show higher FF values as listed in Table 1. This implies that treatments with M:W mixtures on the surface of the PCDTBT:PC71BM film effectively improved the charge transport ability.
In order to confirm the improved charge carrier transport, the mobilities of electrons and holes were measured in the electron-only and hole-only devices using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method according to the following equation:41,42 J = 9/8ε0εrμV2L−3(1)where ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the dielectric constant of the active layer, μ is the electron or hole mobility, V is the voltage drop across the device, and L is the active layer thickness. The above equation holds if the mobility is field independent. Fig. 2a and b demonstrate J0.5–V characteristics for the electron-only devices and hole-only devices, respectively, where Vr (the voltage drop due to contact resistance and series resistance across the electrodes) and Vbi (the built-in voltage due to the difference in the work function of the two electrodes on both sides of the active layer) are subtracted from the experimental applied voltage. εr is assumed to be 3.9 in our analysis. A straight line going through the origin of J0.5–V curves for the devices signifies that the mobility is field independent at fields up to 2 × 105 V cm−1. The field independent mobilities calculated from eqn (1) are listed in Table S2.† It is clear that the mobilities of electrons and holes for the blank devices without any treatment on the active layer are 2.66 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.77 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. However, the mobilities of electrons and holes for the devices with M:W = 6:1 treatment are 5.05 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 6.16 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Enhanced electron and hole mobilities and more balanced charge transport in the PSCs are believed to contribute to the enhanced Jsc and FF observed in the solar cells by reducing the build-up of space charges and charge recombination.

Table 1 also presents the series resistances (Rs) and shunt resistances (Rsh) of the devices obtained from the slopes of the J–V curves at Voc and Jsc, respectively (Fig. 1a). Compared to Device 1 (blank), Device 2 (LiF), Device 3 (PFN) and Device 4 (MT), a decrease of Rs and an increase of Rsh are apparent in Devices 5–7 treated with M:W mixtures. In particular Device 6 treated with the M:W = 6:1 mixture has the lowest Rs (7.16 Ω cm2) and the highest Rsh (1493.2 Ω cm2). The Jsc and FF increases of Devices 5–7 are attributed to the resistance changes. In addition, the electrical leakage of the devices treated with M:W mixtures is suppressed because they have higher rectification ratios at ±2 V than Devices 1–4. As listed in Table 1, the rectification ratios of Devices 5, 6 and 7 are 620.7, 843.2 and 513.9, respectively, while those of Devices 1, 2, 3 and 4 are 296.8, 454.6, 455.9 and 483.0, indicating that the M:W treatment can improve the diode quality and FF value of the PSCs.
In addition, the EQE spectra in Fig. 1c have presented some interesting information. For a given wavelength, the EQE values increase in the order Device 2 < Device 1 < Device 3 < Device 4 < Device 7 < Device 5 < Device 6 which is consistent with the Jsc values from J–V curves under illumination. For Device 3 with PFN spin-coated from the methanol solution, Device 4 (MT) and Devices 5–7 (M:W treatment), the highest EQE values are observed at 412 nm which is assigned to the π–π* transition of the second excited singlet state (S2) of the conjugated backbone in PCDTBT.43,44 However the highest EQE shifts to around 550 nm which is assigned to the π–π* transition of the first excited singlet state (S1) of the conjugated backbone in PCDTBT while the peak at 412 nm is suppressed in Devices 1 and 2 without MT. It is apparent that methanol gives rise to such a difference. Because alcohol treatments do not change the light absorption of the components in the active layer blend,34 the EQE changes caused by MT originate from the reconstructed phase separation of the active layer blend.
Water contact angle characterizations were used as a tool to gain the surface polarity and calculate the surface components of the blend film.45,46 Measurements of the water contact angle were carried out on the PCDTBT film, PC71BM film, PCDTBT:PC71BM film and PCDTBT:PC71BM film treated with methanol and M:W mixtures as shown in Fig. 3. The contact angles of the pure PCDTBT film and PC71BM film are 94.34° and 77.27°, respectively, indicating that the PC71BM film is more hydrophilic than the PCDTBT film. Therefore we can evaluate the surface components of the PCDTBT:PC71BM film by water contact angles. It is expected that enrichment of PC71BM on the top surface of the blend film will decrease the water contact angle and increase the hydrophilicity and surface energy of the PCDTBT:PC71BM film. The contact angle of the PCDTBT:PC71BM film without MT is 92.40° which is close to 94.34° for pure PCDTBT, indicating that the concentration of PCDTBT is higher than that of PC71BM on the top surface of the blend film. However MT and M:W treatment can decrease the concentration of PCDTBT and increase the concentration of PC71BM on the surface of the blend film because MT decreased the contact angle to 90.18° and M:W treatments decreased the contact angles to 90.46° for 9:1, 86.93° for 6:1 and 87.97° for 3:1. To semi-quantify the content of PC71BM or PCDTBT at the top surface, the surface coverage fraction (f) of PC71BM on the surface of the blend film was calculated by fitting the contact angle results to the Cassie–Baxter equation.47 cosθ = fcosθPC71BM + (1 − f)cosθPCDTBT(2)where θPC71BM, θPCDTBT and θ are the measured water contact angles of the pure PC71BM film, pure PCDTBT film and the PCDTBT:PCBM blend film, respectively. The detailed parameters are summarized in Table 2. For the pristine PCDTBT:PC71BM film without any treatment, the calculated PC71BM surface coverage fraction f is about 11.43%, that is, 1 − f for the surface coverage fraction of PCDTBT is about 88.57%. Evidently the PCDTBT content is much higher than the PC71BM content on the pristine PCDTBT:PC71BM film. However when the blend film was treated with methanol, f for PC71BM increased to 24.51% and 1 − f for PCDTBT decreased to 75.49%. Similarly M:W treatments cause the f values to be 22.86% for 9:1, 43.67% for 6:1 and 37.54% for 3:1. These f changes clearly suggest that the M:W treatments result in an increase of PC71BM content and a decrease of PCDTBT content on the top surface of the blend films. In particular M:W = 6:1 treatment has increased the f to 43.67% which is nearly 4 times the f (11.43%) on the pristine PCDTBT:PC71BM film. As a result, the PC71BM surface coverage fraction (43.67%) is close to the PCDTBT surface coverage fraction (56.33%). Obviously MT and M:W treatments drove PC71BM to move from the interior to the top surface due to volatilization of methanol and water, resulting in a vertical redistribution of the components in the blend film.

In order to verify the proposed vertical distribution evolution of the components in the blend film during the MT and M:W treatments, we employed XPS depth profiling analysis. The S2p peak area represents PCDTBT. The C1s peak area represents the total content of PCDTBT and PC71BM. The S2p/C1s peak area ratio could be proportionally correlated with the percentage of PCDTBT in the blend. Therefore, the content distributions of PCDTBT and PC71BM in the vertical direction from top to bottom can be evaluated by using the S/C peak area ratios in XPS depth profiling. Fig. 4 shows the S/C ratio versus the etching time or the corresponding thickness of the PCDTBT:PC71BM film. Since 6 nm can be removed by 1 minute etching, 0, 1, 2, 3, 6 and 9 minute etchings approximately correspond to 70 nm (top surface), 64 nm, 58 nm, 52 nm, 34 nm and 16 nm (bottom) from the bottom to the top surface. (NS/NC)mea. is the NS/NC ratio measured by the quantitative analysis of XPS. (NS/NC)cal. is the calculated NS/NC ratio of the blend film according to the weight ratio and molecular formula of PCDTBT and PC71BM under the assumption that the vertical distribution of PCDTBT and PC71BM is average and uniform from top to bottom.48 For the pristine PCDTBT:PC71BM film without any treatment, the (NS/NC)mea. ratio at the top surface is nearly 3.8 times that at the bottom, indicating that more PCDTBT molecules enrich at the top surface and more PC71BM molecules aggregate at the bottom. For the PCDTBT:PC71BM film treated with methanol, (NS/NC)mea. at the top surface becomes about 3.3 times that at the bottom, indicating that the PCDTBT concentration decreased at the top surface and slightly increased at the bottom, and the PC71BM concentration increased at the top surface and slightly decreased at the bottom. For the PCDTBT:PC71BM film treated with M:W = 6:1, the (NS/NC)mea. ratio at the top surface becomes about 2.9 times that at the bottom, suggesting that the PCDTBT concentration further decreased and the PC71BM concentration further increased at the top surface. This indicates that the M:W = 6:1 treatment led to a more uniform vertical distribution than MT because all the (NS/NC)mea. values for PCDTBT:PC71BM treated with M:W = 6:1 are closer to the theoretical average NS/NC ratio, (NS/NC)cal. = 0.01128 as shown in Fig. 4.

In order to explain these findings, the detailed evolution of phase separation in the blend film is schematically illustrated in Fig. 5. Polymer:fullerene blends are easy to precipitate and demix during spin coating due to the low entropy of mixing and the different surface energies of components.1,49 The blend film evolution is a rather complicated process, in which both thermodynamic and kinetic parameters play substantial roles. Polymers always have a higher surface energy than fullerene derivatives. In order to reduce the overall energy, polymers tend to accumulate at the top (air) surface, while fullerene derivatives correspondingly aggregate at the bottom interface.50 However such a distribution of the polymer and fullerene derivative in the active layer is not conducive to improve the performance of the device. In the PCDTBT:PC71BM blend solution, a mixture of DCB and CB with a volume ratio equal to 3:1 was used as a working solvent. Because the boiling points of DCB and CB are 180 °C and 132 °C, respectively, a small amount of solvents mainly DCB could be left in the interior of the blend film after spin-coating. PC71BM aggregating at the bottom has a good solubility in DCB. Therefore residual DCB in the blend film can exist in the form of the solvent of PC71BM. After methanol and M:W mixtures were spin-coated on the PCDTBT:PC71BM film, they quickly penetrated into the films. When the blend film treated with methanol was baked at 75 °C, quick evaporation of low boiling point (64.5 °C) methanol which is highly intersoluble with DCB could drive PC71BM accompanying DCB to migrate and diffuse from the interior of the blend film to the top (air) surface. However volatilization of methanol is fast so that its working time for the redistribution of the donor and acceptor in the active layer is not long enough. Adding a little bit water into methanol can increase the boiling point of methanol, appropriately prolong the evaporation time of the solvent and provide a longer time for the migration of PC71BM from the bottom to the surface. The boiling points of M:W = 9:1, M:W = 6:1 and M:W = 3:1 have been calculated to be 67.8 °C, 68.7 °C and 72.0 °C, respectively. Our results have demonstrated that 6:1 is an optimal M:W ratio to control the evaporation time of the solvent. As a result, the vertical distributions of PCDTBT and PC71BM become more uniform in the blend film treated with M:W = 6:1, which not only provides a large interface area between PCDTBT and PC71BM for efficient exciton dissociation but also offers continuous pathways for more direct and quick charge transportation to the corresponding electrodes. It should be noted that incorporating excess water will damage the inter-solubility between methanol and DCB and decrease the efficiency of methanol in driving PC71BM to move from the bottom to the surface. It will lead to a decrease of Jsc. Indeed the Jsc of Device 7 treated with M:W = 3:1 is lower than that of Device 6 treated with M:W = 6:1 as shown in Table 2.

Inspired by the successful application of M:W treatment on the PCDTBT:PCBM film, we further checked its effect on PTB7:PC71BM based devices to demonstrate its universality for polymer:fullerene blends. Fig. 6a presents the J–V characteristics of the devices with LiF as a CIL under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G irradiation. The EQE spectra of the devices are presented in Fig. 6b. The performance parameters of the PSCs are summarized in Table 3. As we expected, Device 10 (M:W = 9:1), Device 11 (M:W = 6:1) and Device 12 (M:W = 3:1) show the PCE values of 8.40%, 8.47% and 8.20%, respectively, which are higher than those of Device 8 (7.41%) without any solvent treatment and Device 9 (8.14%) with MT. Obviously Device 11 shows the highest PCE because it has the highest Jsc, Voc and FF among all the devices. In addition, for the PSCs with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/Al, M:W = 6:1 treatment also led to an obvious increase of the PCE compared to the devices with and without MT (Fig. S4 and Table S3†). These results indicate that M:W treatment on the active layer is a universal method to fabricate high-performance PSCs with greener solvents.

4. Conclusion
M:W treatment on polymer:fullerene blend films was found to be an effective, green and low-cost solution to enhance photovoltaic performance. For the PSC based on PCDTBT:PC71BM treated with M:W = 6:1, the maximum PCE reached 7.44% which is 1.13 times that (6.58%) of the PSC based on PCDTBT:PC71BM treated with methanol, and even higher than the PCE values of the PSC with LiF (6.00%) and the PSC with PFN (6.88%) as a cathode interlayer. Combined contact angle measurements and XPS depth profiling demonstrated that the M:W treatments resulted in an increase of the PC71BM content on the top surface of the blend films because evaporation of the solvents drove PC71BM to migrate and diffuse from the interior of the blend film to the top (air) surface. Such a redistribution of the polymer and fullerene derivative in the active layer is conducive to improve the performance of the PSCs. As a universal approach, M:W = 6:1 treatment on the PTB7:PC71BM film also gave rise to an obvious enhancement in the PCE compared to MT.
