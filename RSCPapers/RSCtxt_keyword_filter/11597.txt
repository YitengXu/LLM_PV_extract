    , Accepted 15th March 2011First published on 1st April 2011AbstractA novel class of organic semiconductors aimed at improving the efficiency of organic photovoltaic devices is investigated by an ab initio electronic structure theory. Two conjugated block copolymers composed of chemically bound donor and acceptor blocks show substantial charge transfer upon photoexcitation, suggesting that the optically excited states are separated charge pairs rather than strongly interacting charges forming excitons. In contrast, little charge transfer is seen in the ground electronic state. The optical cross-sections of the charge separated states are quite high due to a good overlap of the tails of the ground and excited state wavefunctions. The absorption spectra of the systems cover visible spectrum and extend to the infrared, suggesting good prospects for light harvesting. The calculation results indicate that the proposed class of semiconducting molecular heterojunctions may overcome the exciton bottleneck problem in organic photovoltaic materials.
1. Introduction
Solar power provides an attractive alternative to fossil fuels, hydro power and other energy sources due to the abundance and pollution-free nature of sunlight. Great efforts are devoted to studying the mechanisms of light harvesting and conversion of photons to electrical current. A broad variety of semiconducting materials are investigated for these purposes, ranging from the traditional silicon and other inorganic semiconductors, to organic–inorganic hybrids, to purely organic molecular and polymeric systems.1–9 Solar-to-electric energy conversion is an established technology. However, current solar cells are either too expensive or too inefficient for widespread application. New, cheaper materials and more efficient mechanisms of solar energy harvesting and utilization are needed.
The basic principles of a solar cell are well-understood.1–15 It is a semiconductor device that converts absorbed sunlight into electricity. Photons incident on the semiconductor create bound electron-hole pairs, known as excitons. Excitons dissociate into free charges that carry electrical current. Solar cell properties depend critically on competition between various pathways that follow photon absorption. Exciton dissociation and subsequent transport of charge carriers to collecting electrodes should be faster and significantly more efficient than charge carrier recombination and non-radiative or radiative relaxation. Silicon and other inorganic semiconductors have large dielectric constants. As a result, the Coulomb interaction between the charges generated by photoexcitation is reduced. The excited states, so-called Wannier excitons, are significantly delocalized, and the exciton binding energies are small, on the order of 10 meV.9 In contrast, dielectric constants of organic molecular and polymeric semiconductors are small. Consequently, light absorption creates Frenkel excitons with large binding energies, 0.4–1.0 eV.7 Photogeneration of free charge carriers in organic semiconductors requires dissociation of excitons at a heterojunction with another material having energy band offsets that are sufficiently large for exciton dissociation.16–20 Furthermore, carrier mobilities in inorganic semiconductors are orders of magnitude larger than in their organic counterparts, where typical exciton diffusion lengths are only 5–20 nm. These fundamental differences in the photoconversion and charge transport mechanisms translate into a huge difference in photovoltaic power conversion efficiency: 15–35% for inorganic semiconductors (Si, GaAs)9 compared to 3–7% for organic semiconductors.7,21,22
In this paper we explore the possibility to engineer organic-organic hybrid semiconductors with electronic and optical properties that are capable of generating delocalized, Wannier-type excitons upon photon absorption. Achieving this goal will alleviate the excitonic bottleneck problem associated with separation of the interfacial charge pairs and generation of free electrons and holes in organic solar cells. The block copolymer architecture and advances in co-polymerization offer an opportunity to realize the proposed hybrid materials.23–28 Each chain of the material contains a heterojunction. Through a suitable offset of the energy levels between the donor and acceptor co-polymers, the hybrid material can enable development of devices that will constitute the logical limit in the progression from bilayered devices29,30 to current bulk heterojunction solar cells.31–33 Using ab initio electronic structure theory we investigate the ground and excited state electronic properties and optical spectra of two novel electron donor–acceptor (D–A) diblock copolymers. By design, the heterojunctions should exhibit delocalized electronic excitations with well separated electrons and holes.
Following a description of the systems and methodology used to perform the calculations, we discuss in detail the relevant properties of the D–A diblock copolymers. Remaining within a simple single-particle picture, ground state density functional theory (DFT) allows us to characterize the electron orbitals and density distributions of the donor and acceptor blocks, and the combined systems. Time-domain DFT (TDDFT) provides a more rigorous model for the electronic excitations in these systems, by properly mixing single-orbital excitations, and generating transition dipole moments and optical absorption spectra. We conclude the paper with a summary of the key findings and a brief discussion of future theoretical work required for a more complete characterization of the proposed materials.
2. Methods
The electronic structure and spectra for the diblock copolymer systems under investigation were calculated using ab initio DFT and linear-response TDDFT,34 as implemented within the Gaussian 03 software package.35 The B3LYP hybrid DFT functional and the 6-31g basis set were used. These are known to provide reliable results for molecular geometries and electronic excitation energies.36,37 While more extensive basis sets are generally desirable, for instance, to achieve better representation of the d-orbitals on the sulfur atoms, the relatively large size of the multimers considered here make TDDFT calculations with larger bases prohibitively expensive. Typically, extending the basis set does not significantly affect polymer properties36 Further, B3LYP with moderate basis sets such as 6-31g gives good description of electron transfer (ET) properties, including both the extent of ET and the energies of excited states. Larger bases, in particular, those including diffuse functions may overestimate the extent of ET due to the self-interaction problem of DFT.38,39 The goal of the present work is to establish that the lowest energy charge-transfer electronic excitations in the D–A block copolymers have significant oscillator strength. The results obtained with a smaller basis set are likely to underestimate the optical activity, since smaller bases limit the overlaps between the donor and acceptor orbitals. Calculations using a larger basis set will tend to predict stronger optical activity, confirming the conclusions of the current work.
The geometric structure of all molecules considered here was fully optimized using ground state DFT. The optimized structures are shown in Fig. 1. Each diblock copolymer is composed of 6 repeat units of polythiophene (PT), and 2 or 3 units of benzimidazobenzophenanthroline ladder derivative (BBLD)40,41 or naphthalenebiscarboximide-thiophene polymer (PNDIT),42,43 respectively. PT can be considered as a simplified version of poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT), which is a popular electron donating polymer. The PT monomers are much smaller than the BBLD and PNDIT monomers, and the relative numbers of monomers in each diblock copolymer were chosen to produce donor and acceptor fragments of roughly similar lengths. The overall size of the diblock copolymers was limited by the computational expense of the TDDFT calculations. The optimized structures shown in Fig. 1 were used to perform TDDFT calculations of the excited state properties.

3. Results and discussion
This section focuses first on the data obtained in the DFT calculations, which describe ground state properties, including molecular geometry, electron density distribution and single-particle orbitals. Following the discussion of the electronic structure provided by the DFT calculations, the analysis extends beyond the single-particle picture and considers the excited state properties and optical absorption spectra obtained with linear-response TDDFT.
3.1 DFT: orbital energies and localizations
The diblock copolymer systems under investigation remain flat upon geometry optimization, Fig. 1, allowing the π-electron conjugation to extend all the way across the D–A heterojunctions. The electronic densities of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of the two classes of compounds are shown in Fig. 2 together with HOMO−1, LUMO+1 and LUMO+2. In both systems HOMO and HOMO−1 are well localized on the donor fragment, PT. In contrast, the unoccupied orbitals are localized on the acceptor fragment, either BBLD or PNDIT. While the majority of the density for each orbital is strongly confined to either donor or acceptor block, the orbital tails extend onto the complementary segments. This situation is nearly ideal for overcoming the excitonic bottleneck in organic photovoltaic materials. An excitation of each heterojunction will promote an electron from an occupied to a vacant orbital. Since the occupied and vacant orbitals are localized on different segments, the excitation will create a charge separated state, with the electron now located on the acceptor fragment, BBLD or PNDIT, and a hole created on the donor fragment, PT. The fact that the tails of the occupied and vacant orbitals extend onto the complementary fragments suggests that the coupling between the donor and acceptor fragments should be sufficiently strong to make the excitations optically active.
 Fig. 2  Frontier orbitals of the BBLD-PT and PNDIT-PT diblock copolymers. 
The densities of the occupied and vacant orbitals shown in Fig. 2 indicate that not just the HOMO–LUMO transition, but also a number of other low energy excitations should have the desired properties: electron transfer (ET) in the excited state and reasonable optical activity due to the overlap of the wavefunction tails. Since both HOMO and HOMO−1 are localized on PT, while LUMO, LUMO+1 and LUMO+2 are localized on the acceptor fragments, at least 6 excited states should exhibit ET. The extent of the orbital delocalization on the complementary fragment determines the balance between the electron-hole separation in the photoexcited state and the state optical activity. A larger degree of delocalization suggests higher optical activity, but at the same time more strongly interacting electrons and holes. In both systems, HOMO−1 extends further on the complementary fragments than HOMO. The LUMO of BBLD is more strongly localized on the donor than its LUMO+1. These observations correlate with the optical activity of the linear adsorption spectra computed with TDDFT and discussed below.
The energy diagram showing the relative energies of the HOMO and LUMO levels of the donor and acceptor species are presented in Fig. 3 together with the work function of an Al electrode. The HOMO energies provide an estimate of the ionization potential (IP) of a given species, while the LUMO energies give the electron affinity (EA). In order for an optical excitation to generate ET, the IP of the donor segment should lie below the EA of the acceptor segment. At the same time, these values should be relatively close to each other, such that optical excitations covered visible range of the solar spectrum. The HOMO and LUMO energies shown in Fig. 3 provide a good representation of the IP and EA. Optical excitation energies are more accurately described by TDDFT that extends beyond the single-particle MO picture.

Photovoltaic applications require that in the absence of light each component of the system composed of the donor and acceptor species connected to electrodes remain electrically neutral. Otherwise, a charge transfer happening between the interconnected subsystems in their ground electronic states could substantially affect the subsystem properties and the overall device performance. For example, subsystem charging can impede current flow via Coulomb blockade.44–46 Further, if the subsystems become charged, the HOMO and LUMO levels can substantially shift, and the level alignment can change. The energy diagram shown in Fig. 3 indicates that each component should remain electrically neutral in the combined diblock copolymer system, since the IP of the electron donor is below the EA of the electron acceptor, and the electrode energy lies between the IP and EA. This expectation is supported by the direct calculation of the charges localized on the donor and acceptor segments connected by the carbon–carbon bonds. Little charge transfer is seen. According to the Mulliken population analysis, only 0.15 e shifts from PT to BBLD in the ground electronic state. Here, “e” is the electron charge. The corresponding number for the PT-PNDIT system is even smaller and equals to 0.06 e. Considering the large overall number of electrons in the diblock copolymer heterojunctions, these charge shifts are negligible.
The density of states (DOS) for the BBLD-PT and PNDIT-PT systems is presented in Fig. 4. The DOS reflects the energies of all occupied and vacant MOs in these organic-organic D–A heterojunctions. The energy range between −2 and +2 eV is of primary interest for the present study. Within this energy range the structure of the DOS corresponding to the occupied MOs is very similar between the two diblock copolymer systems, indicating that the occupied orbitals are originating from the commonly shared PT donor fragment. Since the majority of the high energy occupied MOs arise from the electron donor, one can expect that excitations within this energy range will give ET. This expectation is supported further by the differences seen in the positive sections of DOS corresponding to unoccupied orbitals of the two diblock systems. The differences indicate that the unoccupied orbitals belong to the unique parts of each heterojunction, BBLD and PNDIT, which accept electrons from PT during photoexcitation. The unoccupied states are denser in PNDIT than in BBLD, suggesting that the low energy optical excitations in the PNDIT-PT system are more closely spaced than in BBLD-PT.

3.2 
          TDDFT: optical absorption spectra
Electronic excitations and their optical activity are predicted by TDDFT calculations. The calculations generate excitation energies and oscillator strengths, creating an optical absorption spectrum that consists of a series of lines. In order to reflect various sources of line broadening, each optical line obtained in the TDDFT calculations was “dressed” with a Gaussian. One width parameter was used for all Gaussians in a given spectrum. The spectra of the isolated PT, BBLD and PNDIT species are presented in Fig. 5. Fig. 6 shows the spectra of the BBLD-PT and PNDIT-PT diblock copolymer molecular heterojunctions. The original TDDFT data are presented in Table 1. In addition to the excitation energy and oscillator strength, Table 1 shows the dominant orbital transitions contributing to each photoexcitation.

The spectral calculations extend beyond the single-orbital picture and include electron correlation effects. As a result, the lowest photoexcitation energies seen in the spectra differ slightly from the corresponding orbital energy gaps shown in Fig. 3.

Consider the electronic excitation of isolated BBLD, PNDIT and PT, Fig. 5. The absorption maxima for free BBLD and PT fragments are located around 580 nm and 530 nm in the calculated spectra. This is very close to 570 nm and 500–520 nm observed in the experimental spectra measured in polymer films.5,47,48 The absorption maximum lies at 610 nm for free PNDIT. The excitation energies of the BBLD and PNDIT acceptor segments are smaller than the excitation energy of the PT donor. Hence, one can expect that in a D–A diblock copolymer, an excitation of PT will generate ET to either BBLD or PNDIT rather than remaining within PT. This is indeed the case.
Comparing the optical absorption spectra of the isolated chromophores, Fig. 5, to those of the combined diblock systems, Fig. 6, we observe strong red-shifts in the lowest excitation energies of the latter. The transition in the BBLD-PT diblock copolymer appears already at 1171 nm, which is part of the near-infrared spectral region. The spectrum of PNDIT-PT also shifts to the infrared zone. It should be noted that DFT tends to favor charge delocalization due to the so-called self-interaction problem.38,39 As a result, the energies of states involving significant amounts of ET may be artificially too low, and the excitation wavelengths reported above may be somewhat overestimated. Nevertheless, we believe that the excitation energies calculated here for the diblock copolymer are fairly accurate, as supported by the analysis based on the electronic properties of individual donor and acceptor components, whose calculated excitation energies agree well with experiment. In particular, the red-shifts predicted by the calculations for the combined systems, Fig. 6, relative to the spectral peaks of the individual components, Fig. 5, can be easily understood by considering the energies of the HOMO and LUMO levels shown in Fig. 3. The LUMO level of BBLD is higher than the HOMO level of PT by only 0.8 eV. The corresponding D–A HOMO–LUMO energy difference is 1.0 eV in the PNDIT-PT system. These orbital energy differences correlate with the TDDFT excitation energies of 1.06 and 1.14 eV, Table 1.
As expected, the lowest energy optical transitions resulting in ET are not as intense as some of the higher excitations localized on individual donor and acceptor fragments, Fig. 6. Still, the ET transitions show strong optical activity that is sufficient for good solar energy harvesting. The optical activity of the ET transitions arises from the overlaps of the tails of the electron donor and acceptor orbitals localized in each fragment, Fig. 2. The wavefunction tails are seen particularly well in Fig. 7, which shows the atomic contributions to the transition dipole moments for the lowest energy electronic excitations in each copolymer system. The red and blue circles indicate the positive and negative charges generated by the excitations. As expected based on the energy diagram, Fig. 3, the charge shifts from the PT donor to the BBLD and PNDIT acceptors. At the same time, small blue circles associated with the acceptor orbitals extend deeply into the donor regions. A few red dots are seen in the blue regions as well.
 Fig. 7  Atomic contributions to the transition dipole moments of the lowest energy excitation in (a) BBLD-PT and (b) PNDIT-PT systems. The excitation is transferred from the PT donor to the BBLD and PNDIT acceptor fragments, as indicated by the red and blue colors, respectively. The size of the circle centered at a given atom is proportional to the atom's contribution to the transition dipole moment. The molecular structures shown below the data illustrate approximate orientations of the molecules. 
The excitation energies, wavelengths, oscillator strengths and dominant orbital contributions to the eight lowest energy excitations in the BBLD-PT and PNDIT-PT diblock systems are detailed in Table 1. For reference, the same data are presented for the isolated PT chromophore. In both diblock copolymers, the absorption wavelengths extend to the infrared region, expanding considerably the range of solar energy harvesting. All excitations, including the lowest energy transitions, are optically active with considerable oscillator strengths. The oscillator strength values are more uniform in BBLD-PT than PNDIT-PT. The latter system has two transitions, 3 and 7, that are less optically active. At the same time, this diblock copolymer shows a stronger optical activity for the HOMO–LUMO transition, compared to BBLD-PT. Transition 8 in PNDIT-PT is the strongest of all diblock copolymer excitations listed in Table 1. At the same time, it is about three time weaker than the lowest energy excitation of the isolated PT molecule. Comparing the oscillator strengths for the first excited states in the copolymer systems with that for the PT molecule, we observe that the latter is nearly an order of magnitude higher than former. This should be expected, since the ground and excited state orbitals of isolated PT are delocalized over the entire molecule, while the ground and excited state orbitals of the diblock copolymers are localized on different fragments, Fig. 2, and overlap only in their tails, Fig. 7. Nevertheless, the intensities of the lowest energy electronic excitations in the proposed systems are sufficiently high in order to facilitate strong light harvesting.
The degree of orbital delocalization on the complementary fragments, Fig. 2, correlates with the oscillator strength, Table 1, since larger orbital tails create better overlaps between the donor and acceptor orbitals. For example, the HOMO−1 of PT extends further on the acceptor fragments in both BBLD-PT and PNDIT-PT systems. As a result, the oscillator strengths of excitations involving transitions between HOMO−1 and LUMO, which are excitations 4 for both systems, are higher than the oscillator strengths for the HOMO–LUMO transitions. Similarly, the LUMO+1 of BBLD is more delocalized onto PT than the LUMO, see Fig. 2. As a result, excitation 2 for BBLD-PT in Table 1 has a larger oscillator strength than excitation 1.
All electronic excitations, except for excitation 8 in the BBLD-PT diblock, are dominated by transitions between a single pair of occupied and vacant orbitals. Hence, the single particle picture given by the ground state DFT calculation provides a good representation of the much more expensive TDDFT results. Indeed, the HOMO–LUMO energy differences are 0.81 and 1.05 eV in the BBLD-PT and PNDIT-PT diblock copolymers, Fig. 3. The corresponding TDDFT excitation energies are 1.06 and 1.14 eV, Table 1. The good accuracy of the single-particle representation creates great simplifications for the time-domain simulation of the excited state dynamics in phovoltaic materials.3,49 Such time-domain simulations provide a detailed description of the photoinduced electron dynamics and electron–phonon energy losses. However, they are much more computationally demanding than the static calculations described in the present work. The fact that the electronic excitations are well represented at the non-interacting single-particle level further supports the conclusion that the photoexcited states in the molecular heterojunctions under investigation are weakly interacting electron-hole pairs.
4. Conclusions
We explored the possibility for overcoming the exciton bottleneck in organic photovoltaic materials by proposing two novel electron D–A diblock copolymers and investigating their properties using ab initio electronic structure theory. The exciton bottleneck problem arises due to the strong electron-hole interaction and significant structural relaxation that accompanies localized electronic excitations in organic semiconductor systems. We designed two molecular heterojunctions in order to circumvent this problem by creating electronically excited states with well separated electrons and holes.
Ground state DFT calculations show that several low energy occupied and vacant orbitals are well-localized on the electron donor and acceptor segments of a diblock copolymer system. At the same time, the orbitals exhibit long tails that extend onto the complementary fragments, suggesting good optical activity for such charge-separated excited states. The relationship between IPs and EAs of the donor and acceptor components, together with the Mulliken population analysis of the molecular heterojunction electronic structure, show that the connected fragments remain electrically neutral in the ground electronic state. Ground state charge transfer would be undesirable because of Coulomb blockade to charge flow and misalignment of energy levels due to strong reorganization of geometric and electronic structure of each fragment upon formation of the heterojunction.

        TDDFT calculations of the excited state properties indicate that several low energy electronic excitations in the heterojunctions are optically active and produce charge transfer. Good agreement is obtained between the calculated excitation energies and experimental data available for the donor and acceptor polymers. The optical absorption spectra for the two diblock copolymers extend to infrared, expanding considerably the range of absorbed photon energies and suggesting good prospects of light harvesting.
Analysis of the TDDFT excitations shows that each band in the optical absorption spectra is strongly dominated by a single orbital transition. The accuracy of the single-particle representation supports the conclusion that the photogenerated electron and hole interact only weakly. The single-particle representation can greatly simplify future work that will focus on excited state geometry relaxation and time-domain simulation3,49 of the dynamics and mechanisms of photoexcitation, charge separation and electron–phonon energy losses in these systems.
The materials proposed in the current work differ from those used in traditional bulk heterojunction solar cells in several ways. The donor and acceptor components are covalently linked in the copolymers studied here. The covalent linking allows for a very precise control of the D–A interface. The interface is defined much less precisely in the traditional bulk heterojunction materials, in which the donor and acceptor species are randomly mixed. Morphology of D–A mixtures is one of the key factors governing solar cell efficiencies, and the proposed systems take a step further towards a more precise control over the morphology.
The material reported in the present paper contain a D–A heterojunction in every molecule. This fact implies that every absorbed photon is given a strong chance to produce an electron-hole pair, raising the efficiency of the photoinduced charge separation from around 70% in bulk heterojunction solar cells to potentially 100%. This initial charge separation is critical to solar cell performance. At the same time, further steps involving charge transport, relaxation and recombination are also very important. One can expect that these steps may be different in the traditional and proposed materials, and further studies are planned3,49 in order to address the complex photoexcitation dynamics in the block copolymer systems.
The reported calculations show that a significant degree of charge separation can be obtained immediately upon photoexcitation of the proposed D–A block copolymers, providing a step forward towards overcoming the exciton bottleneck problem in organic photovoltaics.

 	Fig. 7  Atomic contributions to the transition dipole moments of the lowest energy excitation in (a) BBLD-PT and (b) PNDIT-PT systems. The excitation is transferred from the PT donor to the BBLD and PNDIT acceptor fragments, as indicated by the red and blue colors, respectively. The size of the circle centered at a given atom is proportional to the atom's contribution to the transition dipole moment. The molecular structures shown below the data illustrate approximate orientations of the molecules.
