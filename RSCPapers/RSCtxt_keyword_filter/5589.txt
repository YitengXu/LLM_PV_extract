    , Accepted 6th February 2023First published on 8th February 2023AbstractAmong all perovskites, Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) perovskites have gained increased attention for LED applications due to their tunable band gap, enhanced stability, and excellent charge transfer. Over the years, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) has increased from 0.1% to 28%. It is helpful to overview the recent developments to understand the PeLEDs. Four methods that are instrumental in improving its properties are summarized in this work: an additive in perovskite, selection of organic spacers, mixed halide perovskite, and 2D/3D heterostructure perovskite. These strategies are used for realizing high-quality pinhole-free RP perovskites by passivating the defects and synthesizing materials with increased stability to yield high-efficiency perovskite-based LEDs and optoelectronic devices. This review also outlines the challenges and future outlooks of PeLEDs.
Introduction
In 2014, the first perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs), which showed external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 0.76% and 0.1% for infrared devices and green devices, respectively, were reported.1 Since then, the performance of LEDs has improved rapidly, and the EQE of PeLEDs has already exceeded 20%.2,3 Ruddlesden–Popperr (RP) perovskites have the chemical formula of (A')2(A)n−1MX3n+1 (A = Cs+, CH3NH3+, CH5N2+; M = Pb2+, Mn2+, Sn2+; X = Cl−, Br−, I−), where A′ is a large organic spacer between the octahedral layers (PEA = phenylethylammonium, BA = butylammonium, PBA = phenyl butyl ammonium ion, et al.), A, M, and X anions form the perovskite framework, and n represents the number of framework layers.
RP perovskite, with a wide and tunable band gap, shows different PL emissions while n changes. As n decreases, the 3D perovskite lattice reduces to less-dimensional homologous structures while the band gap and PL emission energy increase.4,5 During the fabrication process, the small-n phases are initially formed followed by the large-n phases.6,7 The concentration, relationship, and distribution of different n phases can affect the photoelectric properties of the perovskite. Accordingly, suitable n values and narrow phase distribution are important for efficient perovskite devices.8 The large organic cations act as protective layers to protect RP perovskites from water and oxygen; thus, RP perovskites show good environmental stability.9–13 RP perovskites also show tunable emission benefited from the controllable anions (Br−, Cl−, I−).14,15 Therefore, RP perovskites are increasingly attractive for solar cells,16–20 lasers,21–24 photodetectors,25–28 and light-emitting diode (LED)14,29–32 applications due to their unique electrical and optical properties.
Additives are used for improving homogeneity in crystallization to obtain suitable n values, improve the morphology of perovskite, and increase the properties of corresponding LEDs. Zhao et al. demonstrated phosphonate/phosphine oxide dyad added (PEA)2FA4Pb5Br16 for highly efficient perovskite LED with a maximum EQE of 25.1%.33 Phase modulation is usually associated with the selection of organic spacers. The type, concentration, and solubility of organic spacers affect the crystallization and morphology of perovskites and thus affect the optoelectronic performance and stability of PeLEDs. Jiang et al. explored different 2D perovskites based on PEA and monohalogenated PEA and obtained highly efficient LEDs exhibiting one of the highest external quantum efficiency of 10.8% in the 3FPEA device.6 Tunable emission LEDs can be obtained with mixed halides by anion exchange reaction. The emission color of LEDs can be tuned across the entire visible spectra with a different concentration of added heterologous halides. BA2Csn−1Pbn(Br/Y)3n+1 (Y = Cl or I) mixed halide perovskites were reported to have high-efficiency tunable emission LEDs that exhibited a maximum EQE of 2.4%@465 nm, 6.2%@487 nm for blue emitting LEDs and a maximum efficiency of 10.1% EQE for green-emitting LEDs.15 The structural design can also improve the properties of LEDs. 2D/3D heterostructure has been demonstrated to yield efficient solar cells and LEDs. 2D/3D lateral perovskites with suitable organic spacer ratio were fabricated for better stability LEDs, with a maximum luminance of 8400 cd m−2 and one of the highest EQE of 5.3%.9
This review focuses on RP PeLEDs and introduces the four advancements for high-performance optoelectronic devices. We begin by summarizing the improvement of different additives for RP perovskite LED applications, such as organic, metal ions, and polymers. Then, we discuss the influence of organic ligands on perovskite morphology and the performance of corresponding devices, indicating the importance of organic spacer selection. We then discuss the applications of mixed halide RP perovskites in tunable emission LEDs for realizing RP PeLEDs in various applications. Subsequently, we introduce the 2D/3D heterostructure perovskites for LEDs. Finally, we conclude with a discussion about the challenges and future outlooks of efficient RP PeLEDs.
Additives in RP perovskites
Organics
Additives are usually used for phase composition and defect passivation, thus efficiently improving the performance of PeLEDs.8,33–41 Organics, such as ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate (ETPTA) containing CO functional groups, can passivate defects both on the surface and within the perovskites. These materials are, therefore, great candidates for additives.34 As shown in Fig. 1, the quasi-2D perovskite PEA2PbBr4(CsPbBr3)4 layers were fabricated with one-step solution spin coating.34 When ethyl acetate (EA) and ETPTA are drop cast on spinning quasi-films, the nucleation occurs instantaneously to integrate the constituents into the perovskite crystals. The ETPTA layer not only coats the surface of the perovskite film but also permeates into the perovskite layer along the grain boundaries. In the device structure, a thin ETPTA layer also existed between the perovskite layer and the top electron-injecting layer (EIL) of the 2′,2′-(1,3,5-benzinetriyl)-tris(1-phenyl-1-H-benzimidazole) (TBPi) layer. The CO functional groups of ETPTA coordinate with Pb2+ ions to passivate defects and decrease the non-radiative recombination.

5-Aminovaleric acid (5AVA), an amphoteric organic molecule, enables the formation of coordination and hydrogen bonds with Pb2+ cations and Br− anions, respectively.35 With the addition of 5AVA, perovskite PEA2Csn−1PbnBr3n+1 tends to show low-dimensional phases with large n values, favoring the exciton energy transfers to the radiative regions. This added 5AVA also passivates the defects on the surface, leading to the corresponding PeLED with a maximum EQE of 19.3%, a current efficiency of 61.7 cd A−1, and high brightness of 11782.22 cd m−2.35 Jamaludin et al. investigated the effect of triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO) on PBA2Csm−1PbmBr3m+1 perovskites.36 The added TPPO, acting as a crystallization and phase modulator, brings the strong interaction between PBA+ and TPPO molecules to promote the formation of higher m domains instead of low m domains, and thus manage the optimum distribution of donor–acceptor domains. However, they reported that the added TPPO did not incorporate into the perovskites according to X-ray spectroscopy (XPS) results.36 Additive tetraphenylphosphonium chloride (TPPCl) was used to prepare quasi-2D PEA2Csn−1PbnBr3n+1 perovskite films with uniform, pinhole-free, and small grains.37 The additives greatly improve the quality of the films, and thus the corresponding PeLED exhibits a maximum luminance of 35000 cd m−2, a maximum current efficiency of 48.0 cd A−1, and a maximum EQE of 12.42%.37
Adding methanesulfonate (MeS) as a crystallization modulator in perovskite BA2Csn−1PbnBr3n+1 also increases the ratio of large n phase due to the hydrogen bonding interaction between MeS and the BA spacer.38 It also reduces the defects during crystal growth.38 This coordination between MeS and BA is evidenced by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra.38 A novel phosphonate/phosphine oxide dyad molecular additive (PE-TPPO) was used in (PEA)2FA4Pb5Br16 (FA is formamidinium) for efficient PeLEDs, exhibiting a maximum EQE, current efficiency, and power efficiency of 25.1%, 100.5 cd A−1, and 98.7 lm W−1, respectively, while those of the device without the additive were only 15.9%, 69.1 cd A−1, and 47.1 lm W−1.33

Fig. 2 shows the crystallization distribution with the ZrO2 nanoparticle additive in perovskite PEA2FAn−1PbnBr3n+1.8 The additive also functions as a crystallization modulator to distribute the n value in perovskites.8,35,36,38 As shown in Fig. 2a, both low-n and high-n domains can lead to nonradiative recombination.42 Therefore, a suitable n value needs to be chosen for high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY).42,43 Due to the solubility difference of various precursor components, low-n domains at the bottom and high-n domains on the top in the formed quasi-2D perovskite films, as shown in Fig. 2b, thus leading to wide n domains distribution.44 Like other additives, ZrO2 nanoparticles can inhibit the formation of low-n domains to narrow the distribution, leading to efficiency improvement of PeLEDs (Fig. 2(c–e)).8

Metal ions
Another additive is a metal ion, forming mixed perovskites with multiple types of “A” ions to improve the poor electrical properties.45–52 Ag+ ions were added to form the PEA2(AgxCs1−x)n−1PbnBr3n+1 perovskite, achieving defect passivation, carrier balance, and morphology improvement.45 The crystal formation process was attributed to the strong affinity between Ag+ and Br−, which optimized the ion balance and the disorderly crystal orientation. The corresponding LED showed a higher luminance of 9507 cd m−2 and a higher EQE of 10.80% compared with the LEDs without doping, the corresponding values of which were 5031 cd m−2 and 1.03%, respectively.45
In Eu2+-doped (PEA)2SnI4 perovskites, the added Eu2+ ions partially replace the Sn2+, largely suppressing the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ and protecting the film from decomposition.46 The resulting red LED exhibited improved EQE, high luminance, and more stable perovskite film. Mn2+ also replaced some of the Pb2+ to form PEA2(Pb/Mn)(Br/I)4 for LED devices, and this Mn-doped PEA2Pb(Br/I)4 perovskite showed PLQY of 52% with long term stability for at least half year.47 Mn-doped 2D (C8H17NH2)2PbBr4 also showed good stability in the air for more than 90 days. These LEDs could work for six hours at 3 V without any obvious change in the emission spectrum.48 Moreover, doping with Mn could achieve efficient energy transfer with PLQY > 20% and room temperature operability.50 Alternatively, doping can induce new functionalities in semiconductors. Liu et al. synthesized Co2+ doped (PEA)2PbI4 perovskites that exhibited circularly polarized photoluminescence.51
Polymers
Polymers, as one type of additive, have been verified to improve the stability and efficiency of LEDs, decreasing the density of pinholes and improving the air stability and heat stability of the films and devices.3,34,53–56
A widely prevalent polymer, poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) was used to improve the compactness of perovskite films by suppressing the pinholes. It showed threefold and tenfold higher performance than the device without PVP in maximum luminance and current efficiency, respectively.53 The red LED fabricated with phenyl-bromine-ammonium iodide (PBAI)-CsPbBrxI3−x-A/poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (PEOXA) composite thin films showed a maximum luminance of 1942 cd m−2, maximum EQE of 9.1% and a record half-lifetime (T50, time taken to reach half the initial luminance) of 20 h under a constant driving voltage of 2.2 V.54 The PEOXA polymer was used to induce the perovskite phase formation, thus obtaining pinhole-free smooth thin films. The long-chain PBAI enhanced the perovskite stability and the surface quality.54
Liu et al. fabricated perovskite films with a dual-additive strategy.3 A 18-crown-6 could reduce the defects in perovskite, while at the same time, poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (MPEG-MAA) was used to form a polymer for increasing its stability in water and oxygen.3 Finally, a PeLED with a high EQE of 28.1% and a T50 lifetime of 4.04 h was obtained.3 Similarly, the PeLED based on perovskite PMA2FA2Pb3Br10 (PMA is phenylmethylammonium) with fluorene-phenylene-based CPE (MPS2-TEA) as an additive showed the EQE of up to 15.47%, at the current efficiency of 69.02 cd A−1, and maximum luminance of 12252 cd m−2.55 Yuan et al. introduced cationic π-conjugated polymer poly dibromide (PFNBr) for halide-mixed 2D PeLEDs, intending to improve the properties among increased PLQY, defects passivation, and spectral and device stability.56 While under heating at 120 °C for 30 min, the PFNBr-modified film showed emission stability, while the film without PFNBr exhibited emission peak shift.56
Large organic spacers modulation in RP perovskite
The phase distribution of RP perovskites greatly depends on the selection of organic spacers, which determines the energy landscape and the amounts of emitting sites, meanwhile affects the funneling and radiative recombination, tailoring toward a high acceptor-to-donor ratio for higher efficiency devices.57 Additionally, the solubility of the 2D templating molecules is responsible for the crystallization dynamics. Poor solubility leads to the preferential crystallization of the lower dimensional phases during film formation, resulting in higher amounts of donor species.57 Ng et al. explored RP perovskites based on eight different 2D templating molecules from the naphthyl and phenyl alkyl families and compared the concentrations influence of each molecule for the best-performing composition.57 1-Naphthylmethylammonium bromide (1-NMA) added RP perovskites showed the highest solubility with a high acceptor-to-donor ratio, and the 60 mol% addition of 1-NMA showed the smoothest surface without a pinhole. Therefore, the PeLED fabricated with 60 mol% addition of 1-NMA showed the highest current efficiency and EQE of 20.2 cd A−1 and 6.01%, respectively.57
PEA is also utilized as an organic spacer to form 2D perovskites for efficient PeLEDs.29,52,58–66 Kang et al. added organic spacers with similar polarities. Still, different molecular lengths in the primary perovskite CsPbBr3 yielded different distances between the crystalline structures, leading to the corresponding PL and EL emission color changes from green to blue.58 Proper organic spacer length sharply decreased the pinholes on the surface and optimized the film's morphology, as shown in Fig. 3.20,54,57,58,67,68 The best optical and electrical performance was mainly attributed to the uniform film. The LED based on 0.4 mol of phenylethylamine hydrobromide (PEABr) for 1 mol of CsPbBr3 yielded a maximum current efficiency of 43.9 cd A−1 and an EQE of 8.67%.58 The number of organic spacers also influences the properties. The phase distribution can be adjusted by varying the thicknesses of an organic spacer because of the formation of nlow (n = 1, 2, and 3) phase with an increased number of organic spacers.58 Composite materials consisting of PEA2Csn−1PbnBr3n+1 and different ratios of Cs4PbBr6 were also fabricated for PeLEDs, achieving the maximum brightness and maximum EQE (3259 cd m−2 and 4.51%, respectively), corresponding to the composite material with 20% of Cs4PbBr6.65 The excess amount of organic spaces changed the RP perovskite R2SnI4 [R = octyl ammonium (OTA), hexylammonium (HA, or BA)] to new 2D hybrid tin halide (R2+xSnI4+x), increasing PLQY from <1% to >80%.59 Excess alkylammonium ligands can increase ligand incorporation to increase the distortion of the lattice, which increases self-trapped emission.59,60

Two typical kinds of phenyl alkyl ammonium (PMA, PEA, and PBA) and alkyl ammonium (ethylamine (EA), propylamine (PA), and BA) were applied as organic ligands to explore more stable PeLEDs.61 The PEA-modified device displayed the longest half-lifetime of 114 mins and championed a maximum EQE of 9.35%.61 In the alkylamine system, the maximum EQEs of devices gradually rise from 2.72% to 6.33% and 6.66% with the increase of alkyl chain length. But, for phenylalkylamine-based devices, the maximum EQEs increase from 4.91% of PMA-based devices to 9.35% of PEA-based devices and decrease to 4.37% of PBA-based devices device.61 The presence of the phenyl groups and the different lengths of alkyl chains may change the molecular dipoles, thus affecting the optical properties of the perovskite films.6,61,69
Jiang et al. explored that the distribution and crystallinity of different quantum wells (QWs) contributed to the different dipole moments of the bulky cations (PEA, 2-fluorophen-ethyl ammonium bromide (2FPEA), 3FPEA, and 4FPEA).6 They reported that the dipole moment of the bulky cation was probably a key factor controlling the well-width distribution of MQWs. Therefore, bulky cations with variable dipole moments caused the formation of different amounts of small-n QWs, thus resulting in well-width distribution. Because of the minimum energy principle, small-n QWs formed first, followed by large-n QWs.6,7 The high EQE and the maximum luminance (10.8% and 19082 cd m−2, respectively) were achieved in the 3FPEA device due to the moderate well-width distribution caused by 3FPEA cations.6
Meanwhile, the RP perovskites with mixed large organic spacers were also fabricated.20,67,68,70 A bifunctional ligand of amino and carboxylic of the 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzoic acid (ABA) cation was added into perovskite PEAxPA2−x(CsPbBr3)n−1PbBr4 to achieve highly efficient blue PeLEDs with EQE of 10.11% and longer operational stability of 81.3 min.67 This work reported the use of three organic spacers to strengthen the interaction between the perovskite layers to facilitate the carrier transfer in the perovskite film and enhance the radiative recombination rate (Fig. 4).67 The large cationic organic ligands [(H2CCHCH2)(C6H5)3P] with 21 carbons can create a clear separation between metal ions, thus enhancing the PL characteristics.70 (BA0.5PEA0.5)2FA3Sn4I13 RP perovskite is formed by BA+ and PEA+. The large organic cations can effectively suppress the intermediate phase that impedes the homogeneous and ordered nucleation of the crystal to form high-quality perovskite films with improved crystalline quality.20 The mixture 1.5 perovskite [(ODA)0.6(EDBE)0.4]-Pb4MA3I13 (ODA: NH2(CH2)8NH2; EDBE: NH2(CH2)2O(CH2)2O(CH2)2NH2; ODA:EDBE = 3:2 molar ratio) exhibited high preferential orientation perpendicular to the substrate, high surface coverage with less pinholes, and smaller crystals, leading to strong photoluminescence to achieve high efficient PeLED with high EQE of 5.8% and current density of 6.05 mA cm−2.68

Various organic cations, such as naphthyl families, phenyl families, and alkyl families were adopted to explore higher-efficiency PeLEDs. Two or three organic ligands per the spacer cations were used in the perovskite layers, and even new organic ligands are constantly explored to fabricate perovskites. All these are utilized to improve the optical and electrical properties of PeLEDs. Appropriate organic spacers can greatly reduce the surface pinholes, improve the surface smoothness to optimize the morphology, and thus directly influence the advance of device performance. Meanwhile, proper organic spacers will increase the stability of PeLEDs. Various amounts of the organic spacers also influence the phase distribution of perovskite and even the emission color of PeLEDs. Because of the difference in precursor perovskites and preparation methods, the optimal properties of the organic spacer are not adjusted for all the 2D PeLEDs. 2D perovskites are usually fabricated by adding organic spacers into 3D perovskites. The quasi-2D perovskites contain a uniform distribution of 2D and 3D phases by varying the number of organic spacers.71 Therefore, one can adjust the structure to form a 2D/3D heterostructure, contributing to high efficiency for PeLEDs.
Mixed halide RP perovskite
Anion exchange reaction is a simple and effective method to fabricate mixed halide perovskites to achieve the emission color tunable across the entire visible spectra.15 BA2Csn−1Pbn(Br/X)3n+1 (X = Cl, I) has been fabricated for blue, green, and red LEDs with EL emission tunable from 465 to 680 nm, while the obtained blue LED shows the EQEs of 2.4% at 465 nm and 6.2% at 487 nm and the best EQE of green LED is 10.1% at 506 nm.15 Deng et al. fabricated PEA2MA2Pb3I10−xClx films by adding MACl in perovskite PEA2MA2Pb3I10. They demonstrated that the optimized perovskite PEA2MA2Pb3I10−xClx films show increased phase purity and mixed crystalline orientation consisting of in-plane and out-plane orientations by adjusting the MACl concentration.64 The fabricated PEA2MA2Pb3I10−xClx perovskite could function as an LED with a maximum luminance (Lmax) of 1598 cd m−2 and EQE of 2.2%, as well as a solar cell with open voltage (Voc) of 1.183 V and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.64%.64 Herein, the MACl also acted as an additive to increase the phase purity and crystalline orientation. Mn-doped 2D layered perovskites could only be excited by the near UV light, which largely limited the development of perovskites.47 Due to the anion exchange reaction, the anions of I were incorporated into a 2D perovskite lattice to form Mn-doped perovskite PEA2Pb(Br/I)4, resulting in blue light exciton emission.47 Yuan et al. also reported mixed-halide Br/Cl perovskite blue LEDs, which could provide wide-range tunable emission spectra from sky-blue to deep-blue with different chloride concentrations in the precursors.56
2D/3D heterostructure RP perovskite
The organic cations acting as insulating barriers confine the charge carriers and protect the 2D perovskite against moisture and oxygen compared with 3D perovskite.9–12 Due to the energy funneling effect, 2D perovskites exhibit a higher exciton binding energy compared to their 3D counterparts.9,43,72–74 3D perovskites exhibit unique properties, such as the dissociation of the trapped excitons and long carrier lifetime.75–79 The 2D/3D heterostructure contains the unique properties of 3D perovskite and the characteristics of 2D perovskite. It has been reported that mixed 2D/3D perovskites can show high electrical and photo efficiency for both, high-property photovoltaic80–87 and LEDs.9,15,71,74,88–90 Using BA as a spacer to form RP perovskite BA2Csn−1Pbn(Br/X)3n+1 (X = Cl, I) from inorganic CsPb(Br/X)3 (X = I or Cl), the number of planes of CsPbBr3 in the structure is around ∼24 ± 7.15 These large n-value materials show that quasi-2D/3D structures can balance the thin emission line width and high QY of thin nanosheets with the superior conduction properties of thicker perovskite crystals.15
Perovskites are usually fabricated using the solution method. Fu et al. pioneered the fabrication of quasi-2D/3D lateral perovskites with a sequential evaporation method for LEDs.9 As shown in Fig. 5, different BABr/(BABr + CsBr) thickness ratios have been explored to control the molecular structure of the material. The resulting molecular structure is 3D with a ratio of 0 (process I + IV), while the 2D structure is obtained when the ratio is 1 (process I + V). However, when 0 < BABr/(BABr + CsBr) < 1 (process I + II + III), the unique hybrid 2D/3D structures can be acquired. The proper amount of BA can improve the crystallinity in preferential orientation growth and play a vital role as a barrier to slow down the carrier injections for more efficient radiative recombination. Conversely, introducing inorganic Cs cations and forming quasi 2D/3D perovskites leads to better device stability than conventional organic MA/FA 2D PeLEDs.9

The RP-CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals possess higher exciton binding energy and longer exciton lifetimes than all inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite.74 MAxDMAPbBr3+x perovskite was prepared by mixing dimethylammonium (DMA) and MA cations. The 2D/3D mixed perovskite trimethylsilyl methylamine (TmMA)-modified MAxDMAPbBr3+x was formed by adding branched cation (TmMA+).88 Introducing DMA and TmMA cations could blueshift the emission PL to cyan emission and enhance stability.
A vacuum quenching process has been used to obtain dense and uniform perovskite thin films with efficient energy funneling among the evenly-distributed 2D and 3D phases.71 Efficient energy transfers from 2D phases of small n to 2D phases of large n values and 3D phase by tuning the organic spacers, leading to uniform distribution of 2D and 3D phases, which contributes to the high electroluminescent performance.91 The PeLED film was processed from 40% PEABr with features of fairly even distribution of 2D and 3D phases, which achieved high EQEs of 8.24% and 6.12% on active areas of 0.12 and 1 cm2, respectively.71
A mixed 2D/3D perovskite system comprising 3D FAPbBr3 with various concentrations of 2D BA2PbBr4 was employed.89 The formation of the secondary 2D perovskite phases promoted radiative recombination by altering the dynamics of the charge carriers. It is the origin of the improved optical properties of the mixed 2D/3D perovskite system, compensating for the decrease in the local conductivity by compositional optimizations.89
Jiang et al. fabricated 2D layers on the original 3D perovskite surface using organic halide salt post-treatment for 2D/3D vertical perovskite. It improved the exciton radiative recombination rate and enhanced the crystallinity of the thin film.92 The 2D/3D PeLEDs could show deep-blue, pure-blue, and sky-blue emission with mixed halide by adjusting the Cl/Br ratios. Fig. 6a and b depict the fabrication of 2D/3D perovskite, isopropanol solution with mixed phenethylammoniumand chloride (PEACl) and PEABr by spin-coating onto the as-prepared 3D perovskite thin film. The corresponding structure diagram is illustrated in Fig. 6b. The PEAX treatment effectively leads to the formation of multilayer low-dimensional perovskites on the surface of 3D perovskite. The 2D layers affect the energy transfer and improve the crystalline quality of the film, passivate the defects, and lead to the higher efficiency of the blue PeLEDs. Three types of blue PeLEDs (deep-blue, pure-blue, and sky-blue) exhibited high brightness (928, 6727, and 9242 cd m−2) with excellent EQEs (2.11%, 6.29%, and 8.57%).92

Conclusion and outlook
We have systematically summarized the current strategies for the efficiency improvement of RP PeLEDs (summary of the representative performances of PeLEDs in Table 1). These strategies, including adding additives, selecting organic spacers, mixed halide perovskites, and 2D/3D heterostructure perovskites all aimed to passivate defects, increase the stability of LEDs, and improve the optoelectronic properties.

The additives are used for crystallization and optimize the crystal growth to achieve improved morphology and passivate defects. Additionally, the additives act as phase modulators, promoting the formation of high n domains, and tending suitable phase distribution. Therefore, whether organic ligands, metal cations, or polymers, suitable additives effectively improve the efficiency and stability of RP PeLEDs.
The kind of large organic ligands plays an important role in the performance of RP PeLEDs, including the emission color, morphology quality of films, and photoelectric properties of the devices. It is suggested that the variable dipole moments of the organic ligand cations are the main origin of the various optoelectronic properties of quasi-2D perovskites.6,61,69 The moderate dipole moment can lead to suitable phase distributions, contributing to the charge transfer. Although researchers have developed various organic ligands, even two or three different species acting on one target simultaneously for better performance, there are still few systematic studies about the effects of the chain size, length, amount of carbon, differences in the functional groups, and interaction with octahedral structures on RP perovskites and the corresponding LEDs. Therefore, deep research about the effect of organic ligands on RP perovskite is necessary for improving PeLEDs.
Mixed halide PeLEDs exhibit tunable emission and have the potential to realize RP PeLEDs across the entire visible spectra. However, even though much attention has been focused on RP perovskites LEDs, rare efforts are reported about the mixed halide RP perovskites. Mixed halide RP PeLEDs may be a future direction to achieve broadband LEDs over the visible spectra and realize white PeLEDs.
There are certain material challenges to developing RP perovskite-based multifunctional devices. RP perovskites have been demonstrated to be an effective material system for LEDs and solar cells, including bifunctional applications of LED and solar cells.64,93 A lower-energy photoluminescence is exhibited on the edge of exfoliated RP perovskites when n ≥ 3.94 It has been demonstrated that the co-existence of the 3D structure and 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure are responsible for the lower-energy edge emission.95,96 The enhanced optoelectronic properties of this natural 2D/3D heterostructure can significantly improve the efficiency of the 2D perovskite solar cells. It is expected that high-efficiency LEDs and other new photoelectric devices based on RP perovskites will be developed.
