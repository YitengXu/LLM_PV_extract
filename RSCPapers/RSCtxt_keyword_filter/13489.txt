    , Accepted 6th November 2019First published on 7th November 2019AbstractIn order to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSC), a series of absorbent cotton derived carbon quantum dots (CQDs) with different dopants (namely carbamide, thiourea, and 1,3-diaminopropane) have been successfully synthesized by a one-pot hydrothermal method. The average particle sizes of the three doped CQDs are 1.7 nm, 5.6 nm, and 1.4 nm respectively, smaller than that of the undoped ones (24.2 nm). The morphological and structural characteristics of the four CQDs have been studied in detail. In addition, the three doped CQDs exhibit better optical properties compared with the undoped ones in the UV-vis and PL spectra. Then CQD-based QDSC are experimentally fabricated, showing that the short current density (Jsc) and open circuit voltage (Voc) of the QDSC are distinctly improved owing to the dopants. Especially the QDSC with the 1,3-diaminopropane doped CQD achieves the highest PCE (0.527%), 299% larger than that without dopant (0.176%). In order to highlight a reasonable mechanism, the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrum of CQD sensitized TiO2 and the calculated energy band structures of various CQDs are investigated. It's found from the above analysis that the addition of carbamide, thiourea, and 1,3-diaminopropane is beneficial to obtain CQDs of smaller size, and with a smaller band gap and more nitrogenous or sulphureous functional groups, which enhance the light absorption performance and photo-excitation properties. The above factors are helpful to improve the Jsc of QDSC. Nitrogen, acting as a donor to the CQDs, will assist the sensitized photoanode with a higher Fermi level, resulting in a larger Voc of the QSDC. Finally this study builds the relation among the microstructure of the CQDs, three characteristics of the CQDs (namely the spectra, energy band structure and functional groups) and the photoelectric properties of the QDSC, which will provide guidance for the modulation doping of CQDs to improve the PCE of QDSC.
1 Introduction
Compared with traditional crystalline silicon solar cells, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) have many highlighted characteristics including low cost (about 1/5–1/10 of the former) and easy flexibility, etc.1 As part of DSSC, the sensitizer plays a role in absorbing photons and generating electrons, which governs the performance of the photovoltaic devices. Ruthenium complex dyes, such as N719 and N3,2,3 as representative sensitizers for DSSC, restricted the widespread utilization of DSSC due to their high cost. Accordingly, inorganic semiconductor quantum dots (ISQD), such as CdS, CdSe, PbS, and PbSe,4–6 are applied as sensitizers in quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSC), owing to their superiority of multiple excitons, wide absorption and low cost. In particular, QDSC have a theoretical conversion efficiency of up to 44%, breaking the Shockley–Queisser limit of 31%.7 However, highly toxic metals in ISQD give rise to much attention on the health risk, which prompts researchers to seek a green and low cost material as a sensitizer for QDSC.
As a new carbon nanomaterial, carbon quantum dots (CQDs) have found extensive application in bioimaging,8 sensing,9 catalysis,10 batteries11 and super capacitors12 because of their wonderful biocompatibility, high chemical stability, low cost, good water solubility, and tunable band gap.13 Meanwhile, due to their long electron lifetime (about 100 ps), fast electron transfer time (<15 fs from CQD to TiO2) and abundant surface functional groups, CQDs have great potential to replace inorganic semiconductor quantum dots in QDSC.14 Williams et al.15 reported that ultrafast electron injection from photoexcited graphene quantum dots to the TiO2 conduction band with a time constant τi < 15 fs at all exciton photon energies and sample temperatures was attributed to strong electronic coupling through the carboxylate linker, while charge recombination depends strongly on the excitation photon energy or sample temperature. CQDs were first reported as sensitizers for QDSC by Yan et al.16 in 2010, achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.056%. Mirtchev et al.17 integrated CQDs from acid dehydration of γ-butyrolactone with a TiO2 photoanode, and obtained a PCE of 0.13% for QDSC. Then some carbon dot-based materials with heteroatom modification have been studied for solar cells to improve the PCE. Zhang et al.18 prepared nitrogen-doped CQDs from CCl4 and NaNH2 for QDSC, achieving a best PCE of 0.13%. Wang et al.19 fabricated green nitrogen-doped QDSC by direct pyrolysis of citric acid and ammonia, yielding a maximum PCE of 0.79%. Until now, the research on CQD-sensitized QDSC is in its infancy, and the conversion efficiency of devices is still low. In order to further improve the photoelectric performance, it is required to synthesize CQDs with a wider absorption spectrum, a controllable energy band structure and diverse anchoring groups. It seems that N-doped CQDs can probably provide the possibility to efficiently realize the above mission, because the introduction of N into CQDs has displayed enhanced performance for some given applications.20,21
The hydrothermal method is a common technique for CQD synthesis, ascribed to not only the advantages of batch preparation, low cost and high efficiency, but also its facility of doping control with a one-pot approach. When further combined with biomass carbon as precursors, the hydrothermal method is hailed as a green technology. To date, a variety of natural products, including banana juice,22 carica papaya juice,23 apple juice,24 orange juice,25 limeade,26 strawberry powder,27 punica granatum,28 Jinhua bergamot,29 potato,30 garlic,31 coffee grounds,32 green tea,33 honey,34 shrimp,35 milk,36 soy milk,37 cocoon silk,38 grass,39 rose flowers,40 lotus root,41 coriander leaves,42 aloe,43 rice husks,44 pomelo peel45 and Bombyx mori silk,46 have been used to successfully synthesize CQDs by a hydrothermal method.
Cotton is one of the most important crops in the world, with large output and low production cost, making the price of cotton products relatively low. As China is one of the biggest producers of cotton, based on the concept of environmental protection and low cost, this paper takes absorbent cotton as a carbon source to synthesize CQDs by a one-pot method. It is well-known that the content of cellulose in cotton is as high as 98%, which can be hydrolyzed to generate glucose.47 Moreover, it has been demonstrated that glucose can be converted into CQDs through a dehydration reaction.48 Wang et al.49 first synthesized fluorescent carbon dots from degrease cotton without dopant through a one-pot hydrothermal method for selective determination of chromium ions in water and soil samples. In order to improve the photoelectric performance, the effect of some dopants on the PCE of QDSC will be studied. Wang et al.50 added carbamide into glycolic acid, malic acid and citric acid respectively to synthesize nitrogen-doped CQDs by a hydrothermal method. In Wang's work,51 1,3-diaminopropane was studied as an amino-containing precursor for the preparation of nitrogen-doped CQDs. S,N co-doped CQDs were prepared by a hydrothermal method using citric acid as a carbon source and thiourea as both a sulfur and nitrogen source by Wang.52 Carbamide, thiourea, and 1,3-diaminopropane have been successfully used as dopants to synthesize doped CQDs in the previous literatures, but their doping effect wasn't studied on the same carbon source at the same time. Therefore, these three dopants are selected to study the doping effect on absorbent cotton derived CQDs in this study. In this paper, absorbent cotton will be mixed with three dopants, including carbamide, thiourea, and 1,3-diaminopropane, to prepare doped CQDs. Afterwards, the as-prepared CQDs are applied in QDSC to study the relation among the microstructure of CQDs, three characteristics of CQDs (namely the spectrum, energy band structure and functional groups) and the photoelectric properties of QDSC.
2 Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of CQDs
As shown in Fig. 1, absorbent cotton was used as a precursor to prepare CQDs via a one-pot hydrothermal method, together with three different dopants – carbamide, thiourea, and 1,3-diaminopropane. 600 mg precursor and 600 mg dopant were added with 35 mL ultrapure water into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, and then heated in an oven at a temperature of 200 °C for 15 h. After cooling the autoclave down to room temperature inside the oven, the resultant was centrifuged at a rotation speed of 10000 rpm for 30 min, and the supernatant liquor was extracted by suction filtration with a 0.22 μm filter membrane. The obtained CQD solutions doped with carbamide, thiourea, and 1,3-diaminopropane were denoted as CQD-C, CQD-T, and CQD-D respectively, and a CQD solution without dopant was also prepared as a comparison labeled as CQD-N, and they were stored at 4 °C in the refrigerator.

2.2 Assembly of QDSC
The QDSC were assembled by sandwiching a I−/I3− redox electrolyte between a platinum counter electrode and a CQD sensitized TiO2 photoanode, separated by a 50 μm thick spacer. The electrolyte comprised 0.5 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN). The counter electrode was made by pyrolyzing 7 mM chloroplatinic acidhexahydrate (H2PtCl6·6H2O) in isopropanol (IPA) on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass. To obtain the photoanode, an absorbed layer of 25 nm-sized TiO2 particles (P25, Degussa) was first blade coated onto the FTO glass, and then a scattering layer containing 100 nm-sized TiO2 particles was coated on the obtained TiO2 film. Next the twice coated TiO2 film was successively sintered at 450 °C for 30 min, then water-bath heated at 70 °C in TiCl4 aqueous solution (40 mM), and finally heated in air at 450 °C for 30 min. Subsequently the photoanode was sensitized by immersing into a CQD stock solution at room temperature for 24 h. The four QDSCs whose sensitizers are CQD-C, CQD-T, CQD-D and CQD-N are labeled as QDSC-C, QDSC-T, QDSC-D and QDSC-N respectively.
2.3 Characterization and measurements
The morphologies of the as-prepared CQDs were characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM-2100), and the particle sizes were calculated with the software Nano Measurer. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra of the CQD were obtained using a Persee TU-1901 spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using a Smart Fluo-QY spectrometer equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp as the excitation source. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the CQD were measured on a Nicolet IS50 FT-IR spectrometer ranging from 4000 to 400 cm−1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted on an Escalab 250Xi (Thermo Scientific) with an Al Kα source. The current density–voltage characteristics of the QDSC were measured using a Keithley 2400 SourceMeter under AM1.5 simulated illumination provided by a Zolix SS150 solar simulator. The irradiating area was 0.4 cm × 0.4 cm. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the QDSC was acquired using a Zolix Solar Cell Scan 100 with bias illumination. The energy levels of the CQDs were measured by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) method using a standard three-electrode system on a Chenhua CHI660E. All the measurements were performed at room temperature.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Morphological and structural characteristics of the CQDs
With absorbent cotton and different dopants as the raw material, various CQDs are facilely synthesized by a hydrothermal method, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Intriguingly, the colors of the as-prepared CQD solutions vary largely with different dopants. The morphological and structural characteristics of the doped CQDs are studied in detail in comparison with the undoped CQD in the following research. Fig. 2(a)–(d) show TEM images of the synthesized CQDs, indicating that the CQDs are well dispersed in solution with circular morphologies. As seen from the insets of Fig. 2(a)–(d), the average particle sizes of CQD-C, CQD-T, CQD-D and CQD-N are calculated with the software Nano Measurer to be 1.7 nm, 5.6 nm, 1.4 nm, and 24.2 nm, respectively. It is known that the dopants of the precursor determine the particle size of the absorbent cotton derived CQDs under the same process parameters. The size difference is probably caused by the distinct pH values of the dopants, which greatly influence the hydrolysis process of the cellulose.53 The pH value of the solutions in the Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclaves without dopant is 6.86. After the addition of carbamide, thiourea, and 1,3-diaminopropane, the pH values of the solutions in the corresponding Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclaves are 10.28, 9.71, and 12.00 respectively.

To verify the effect of the pH value on the size of the CQDs, CQDs doped with carbamide are prepared by changing the pH value of the precursor. The pH values of the reaction solutions are adjusted to be 8.64 and 11.79 by adding HCl or KOH, and the corresponding as-prepared CQDs are labeled as CQD-C(8.64) and CQD-C(11.79). TEM images of CQD-C(8.64) and CQD-C(11.79) are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), and their average particle sizes are calculated to be 2.5 nm and 2.8 nm respectively. Compared with the original CQD-C, both CQD-C(8.64) and CQD-C(11.79) get larger with the addition of either HCl or KOH, indicating that both an acid and alkali can play a role in adjusting the size of the CQD. Furthermore, it's found that the residual absorbent cotton decreased with either HCl or KOH, showing that both an acid and alkali have an effect on the production of CQDs. Xu et al.54 have controlled the size of saccharide derived carbon spheres by changing the content of alkali in the reaction solution. Demir-Cakan et al.55 have dramatically increased the sphere diameter of carbon spheres by the hydrothermal treatment of glucose in the presence of acrylic acid. However, the influence of pH values on the size of CQDs is limited. Perhaps the dopant itself is the most crucial reason for the large variation of the CQD size, caused by a Maillard reaction between the hydrolysates and dopants during CQD formation.56,57
The chemical compositions and functional groups of the as-prepared CQDs are investigated with both XPS and FTIR spectroscopy. The XPS full scan survey spectra in Fig. 3(a) reveal the existence of carbon (C 1s, 284.8 eV), oxygen (O 1s, 531.9 eV), nitrogen (N 1s, 400.2 eV), and sulphur (S 2p, 167.3 eV) atoms, and the content of each element is shown in Table 1. It is worth noting that the three doped CQDs have a much higher N content compared with the undoped ones, showing that these three CQDs are successfully doped with N atoms. Moreover, the 1,3-diaminopropane doped CQD has the highest C and N contents relative to the other three CQDs, indicating that the degree of hydrothermal carbonization for this CQD is the highest and N doping of the CQD has the most obvious effect. However, the 1,3-diaminopropane doped CQD has the lowest O/C atomic ratio, indicating a lower amount of oxygenic functional groups on the surface. Moreover, the addition of carbamide and thiourea evidently increases the S content of the CQDs, while 1,3-diaminopropane significantly decreases the S content. It is noted that carbamide and 1,3-diaminopropane themselves don’t have the S element, but they affect the formation of sulphureous functional groups on the surface of the CQD. The high resolution scan of the C 1s region in Fig. 3(b)–(e) can be deconvoluted into four single peaks at about 284.0 eV, 284.6 eV, 286.0 eV and 287.7 eV, which are attributed to C–C, CC, C–O/C–N/C–S and CO, respectively.58 The percentage contributions to C 1s of each carbon bond are listed in Table 2. The percentage areas of CC bonding in all the CQDs are substantially higher than that of CO. With the highest N doping, the C–N percentage of the 1,3-diaminopropane doped CQD is naturally the largest among the four CQDs. Peak deconvolution analysis of the N 1s and S 2p XPS spectra is also performed, as shown in Fig. S2 and S3 (ESI†) respectively. The N 1s spectrum has three peaks at around 399.3, 400.0 and 401.0 eV, which are assigned to C–N–C, N–(C)3 and N–H bands respectively. For the 1,3-diaminopropane and carbamide doped CQDs and undoped CQDs, the S element comes from the absorbent cotton itself. Therefore the S 2p spectra of these three CQDs have the same two peaks at around 168.0 eV and 170.0 eV (Fig. S2(a), (c) and (d), ESI†), which are attributed to –C–SO3– and –C–SO4–.59 However, the peaks of the thiourea doped CQD turn into 161.2 eV, 163.7 eV and 168.0 eV, due to the S incorporation from thiourea. The first two peaks agree with the C–S (S2p3/2) and C–S (S2p1/2) covalent bonds,60 and the last peak is attributed to –C–SO3–. It's known from the above analysis that the dopants can effectively change the elemental compositions of the CQDs, especially the functional groups on the surface of the CQDs.

FTIR spectra of the CQDs are presented in Fig. 4 to further confirm the result of XPS analysis. The broad absorption in a wavenumber range of 3200–3600 cm−1 centered at 3450 cm−1 corresponds to the O–H and N–H stretching vibrations of the CQDs,61 while the two shoulder peaks at 2919 cm−1 and 2850 cm−1 originate from the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration modes of C–H of methyl and methylene groups respectively.62 The peak at 1637 cm−1 can be assigned to the CO stretching vibration and aromatic CC vibration, and the band at 1400 cm−1 corresponds to the C–C stretching vibration.63 Compared with the undoped CQD with broad absorption in the range of 800–1600 cm−1, the doped CQDs have more evident peaks at 1190 cm−1 and 997 cm−1, which demonstrates that the dopants change the functional groups on the surface of the CQDs. The band at 1190 cm−1 can be ascribed to the C–O, C–N and C–S bonds64 and that at 997 cm−1 attributed to the –SO3–, C–O–C, and C–O bonds.65 These passivated oxidation layers covering on the surface of CQDs provide different “surface states” for energy levels between π and π* states of CC bonds. Such oxygenic functional groups create different emissive traps, which will result in different emission peaks at distinct excitation wavelengths when subjected to excitation.66 It is found from the above analysis that the addition of the three dopants (namely 1,3-diaminopropane, carbamide and thiourea) does change the functional groups on the surface of the CQD to some degree, enhancing the content of nitrogenous and sulfureous functional groups, and altering the proportions of various functional groups.

3.2 Optical performance of the CQD
In order to detect the light absorption ability, the UV-vis spectra of the CQD solutions are obtained. Fig. 5 presents the UV-vis absorption and transmittance spectra of the corresponding CQDs in various dilution aqueous solutions. For the same CQD solution, the absorption intensities are proportional to the solution concentration, while the peak centers are almost unchanged, showing that the absorption peak of the CQDs won’t change with the solution concentration. It is noted that all the UV-vis absorption spectra have two characteristic absorption peaks, in spite of small differences in peak positions, due to the different dopants. The former peaks of the CQD-C, CQD-T, CQD-D and CQD-N solutions are 289 nm, 288nm, 288 nm, and 289 nm respectively, which are typically assigned to the π → π* transition of the CC segment.67 The latter peaks of these four CQD solutions are 311 nm, 313 nm, 335 nm and 297 nm respectively, which are attributed to the n → π* transition of the CO bond.68 In addition, the absorbance intensities for the CC bonds of the CQDs are all larger than those for the CO bonds, indicating that the contents of CC bonds in these four CQDs are all higher than those of CO bonds, which is consistent with the XPS spectra of the CQDs in Table 2. The specific peak of CQD-T at around 395 nm is possibly due to its unique C–S (S2p3/2) and C–S (S2p1/2) covalent bonds, see Fig. S2(b) (ESI†), which the other three CQDs don’t have. It was noticed that the CQD solution had massive absorption in the ultraviolet region which then declined gradually to the visible region. Moreover, the absorption spectrum of the undoped CQD (namely CQD-N) is so narrow that the absorbance is close to zero at an incident wavelength of about 325 nm. However, the three dopants broaden the absorption spectrum of the doped CQD to more than 400 nm, which is beneficial to be a sensitizer applied in QDSC. The expansion of the absorption to the visible region is attributed to the nitrogenous and sulfureous groups on the surface of the CQDs.

Meanwhile, photoluminescence can be evidently observed under UV illumination with an excitation wavelength of 365nm, as shown in Fig. 1. The CQD-D solution is the brightest of the four CQD solutions, followed by CQD-C, CQD-T and CQD-N. The above phenomenon indicates that the fluorescence intensities of the various CQD solutions with different dopants are significantly different. In order to verify this phenomenon, these CQD solutions are characterized using the PL spectra. Because of the “concentration quenching effect” in which narrower average distances between the luminescent centers at high concentration result in unfavorable energy transfer,69 the PL properties of the CQD will not be presented with the original solution prepared. Fig. 6(a)–(d) depict the PL emission spectra of the four CQD solutions diluted with 50 times ultrapure water at different excitation wavelengths. With the excitation wavelength increasing from 290 to 410 nm, the emission peak wavelengths have an obvious red shift, while the emission intensity first increased and then decreased. The single PL peak, caused by electronic conjugated structure, emissive traps, and free zigzag sites, is attributed to the existence of a single electron transition pathway within the electronic structure of the CQDs.66 The phenomenon of such excitation-dependent emission arises from the surface groups (–OH, CO, C–O, etc.) of the CQD, introducing trap states with different energy levels between the π and π* states of the CC segments.70 Interestingly, the emission intensities of the CQD-C, CQD-T and CQD-N solutions synchronously reach their maximum values when the excitation wavelength is located at 350 nm, while the maximum excitation wavelength of the CQD-D solution is 330 nm. Hereby, the maximum excitation wavelength probably can be modified by the dopants. The emission spectra of the four solutions at the maximum excitation wavelength are selected to form Fig. 6(e). It's evidently found that the emission intensities of the CQD with dopants are much higher than that without dopants. CQD-D obtains the maximum emission intensity, followed by CQD-C and CQD-T. This result is consistent with the above phenomenon in Fig. 1. In addition, the maximum emission wavelengths of CQD-D, CQD-C, CQD-T and CQD-N are 398 nm, 418 nm, 430 nm and 436 nm. Fig. 6(f) shows that larger CQDs show longer emission wavelengths, due to quantum-confinement effects, which is in agreement with previous reports.71,72 The above analyses demonstrate that the dopants, which bring great changes in the size, composition and surface functional groups of the CQDs, will affect the light absorption performance and photo-excitation properties of the CQDs.

To ascertain the origin of the emission from the obtained carbon dots, carbon dots using a single dopant (carbamide, thiourea, and 1,3-diaminopropane) as the carbon source and the same hydrothermal treatment are prepared, and the obtained solutions are labeled as Solution-C, Solution-T, and Solution-D. The maximum PL emission spectra of these three solutions are compared with CQD-N as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The emission intensities of Solution-C, Solution-T, and Solution-D are much lower than that of CQD-N, showing that the origin of the emission of the CQDs comes from the absorbent cotton. As shown in Fig. 6(e), the dopants are helpful for improving the PL emission of absorbent cotton derived CQD.
3.3 Photoelectric properties of CQD-based QDSC
In consideration of the excellent light absorption performance and photo-excitation properties, the CQDs are expected to be applied in optoelectronic devices. Therefore, CQD sensitized solar cells are experimentally constructed. The QDSCs consist of an FTO-supported CQD sensitized TiO2 photoanode, an I−/I3− redox electrolyte, and a pyrolytic Pt counter electrode. The J–V curves of QDSC with different sensitizers are presented in Fig. 7, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 3. The photovoltaic performances of the CQD-based devices show significant differences, whose PCE values vary in a range between 0.176% and 0.527%. Another group of QDSCs are also fabricated to confirm the above results, and the J–V curves and corresponding photovoltaic parameters are shown in Fig. S5 and Table S1 (ESI†) respectively. The difference between the two groups is small, manifesting that the photovoltaic performances of such QCSCs have good repeatability. It's worth noting that the photovoltaic properties of the doped QDSC are all improved to different degrees compared with the one without dopant. Especially, the PCE of the 1,3-diaminopropane doped QDSC is 299% higher than that without dopant. The doping effects of the QDSCs are ranked from the highest to the lowest: 1,3-diaminopropane, carbamide, and thiourea, which is consistent with the result of their comparison in the particle size of the CQDs. It is found from Table 3 that the differences of the QDSC performance mainly come from the short circuit current (Jsc), followed by the open circuit voltage (Voc). The Jsc values of the QDSCs change between 0.76 mA cm−2 and 1.28 mA cm−2, while the Voc values range from 0.47 V to 0.57 V. Above all, absorbent cotton derived carbon dots can be effectively doped by the above three dopants as sensitizers for QDSC, which distinctly improve the photovoltaic performance over that without dopant. Furthermore, 1,3-diaminopropane is the most effective among the three dopants applied in absorbent cotton derived carbon dots for QDSC. Meanwhile, the photovoltaic parameters obtained from previously reported CQD-based QDSC73–75 whose carbon sources are also from biomass and the current work have been listed in Table S2 (ESI†) for comparison. It is found that the PCE of biomass CQD-based QCSC is distinctly improved with the dopant in this work.

3.4 Improved mechanism of the photoelectric properties of CQD-based QDSC
In order to highlight a reasonable mechanism behind this phenomenon, the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrum of CQD sensitized TiO2 and the calculated energy band structures of various CQDs are investigated. It can be seen from Fig. 8 that doped-CQD sensitized photoanodes achieve much more enhanced absorption in the region from 350 to 800 nm than the undoped photoanode, which is very helpful for application as photosensitizers for QDSC. The absorbance of the 1,3-diaminopropane doped CQD sensitized photoanode is the highest, followed by carbamide and thiourea. The above ranking of the sensitized photoanodes for light absorbance is in agreement with that of QDSC for Jsc. The photoelectric properties of the sensitized photoanodes are further confirmed by IPCE measurement of QDSCs in Fig. 9. It is obviously found that the IPCE of the QDSC with dopants is significantly enhanced over the QDSC without dopant, indicating that the dopants can improve the Jsc of QDSC. The highest value of IPCE belongs to the 1,3-diaminopropane doped QDSC. Moreover, the ranking result of IPCE is in accordance with that of Jsc, which conforms to formula (1). Donor–acceptor interactions determine the electron transfer mechanism across the CQD/TiO2 interface, and thus influence the solar cell performance. Long et al.76 found that efficient charge separation in nanoscale materials depends strongly on the type of donor–acceptor interactions, and demonstrated that covalent bonding leads to weak coupling and nonadiabatic electron transfer, while through-space π-electron interactions produce adiabatic electron transfer, which greatly influences the solar cell performance. In the next study, it's necessary to ascertain the donor–acceptor interactions. IPCE = 1240Jsc/(λPin)(1)

The calculated energy band structures of various CQDs via the CV method are displayed in Fig. 10. The HOMO and LUMO levels of CQD-C, CQD-T and CQD-D are evidently different from those of CQD-N, which demonstrates that the energy levels are successfully modulated by the dopants. The energy levels of all the prepared CQDs match well with those of TiO2 and the electrolyte, while their differences result in the variation of Voc for the QDSCs. Voc corresponds to the difference between the Fermi level of the quantum dot-sensitized photoanode and the redox potential of the electrolyte.77 Nitrogen acts as a donor to CQD. According to formula (2), the distance between the conduction band (Ec) and the Fermi level (EF) is a logarithmic function of the donor impurity concentration (Nd). The Fermi level moves to the conduction band as the donor impurity concentration increases. A higher Fermi level means an increase in Voc. As shown in Table S3 (ESI†), the band gaps of CQD-C, CQD-T and CQD-D are lower than CQD-N, which accounts for the excellent light absorption performance and photo-excitation properties of the doped CQDs compared to those of the undoped ones. The band gap of CQD-D is the smallest among the four CQDs. The previous ref. 78 and 79 have reported that electron rich N-doping can lower the work function of carbon. In addition, the lower LUMO levels of CQD-T and CQD-D compared to CQD-N are attributed to better electron injection from the CQD to TiO2. The LUMO level of CQD-D is the closest to the conduction band of TiO2. Zhang et al.18 have demonstrate that N doping can reduce the LUMO of CQD and then improve the conversion efficiency of QDSC. The HOMO levels of CQD-C and CQD-D are higher than that of CQD-N, which is helpful for migration of holes from the CQD to the redox electrolyte. Ec − EF = kTln(Nc/Nd)(2)
 Fig. 10  Energy band structures of QDSCs. 
To analyze the relation among the microstructure of the CQD, three characteristics of the CQD (namely the spectrum, energy band structure and functional groups) and the photoelectric properties of the QDSC, some characteristics parameters of the CQDs and corresponding QDSCs are listed in Table 4. The PH value of the reaction solution has an effect on the particle size of absorbent cotton derived CQD by influencing the hydrolysis process of cellulose. Perhaps the dopant itself is the most crucial reason for the large variation of the CQD size, caused by a Maillard reaction between the hydrolysates and dopants during the CQD formation.56,57 The major consequence of the quantum confinement effect is that the band gap of the quantum dots shows dependency on their size, which leads to distinct size-dependent optical and spectroscopic properties of the quantum dots.80,81 Lu et al.82 and Ritter et al.83 illustrated the dependence of the band gap on the size of GQDs by scanning tunneling spectroscopy, and affirmed that with increasing the size of the GQDs the band gap decreases. Our result about the relation between the size of CQD and their band gap disagrees with the conclusion. Jin et al.84 pointed out that another route to tune the band gap of GQDs is through chemical functionalization, and demonstrated that the electron-withdrawing or electron-donating behaviors of the functional groups can tune the band gap of the GQDs from both experimental and computational analyses. Unpaired electrons of the nitrogenous functional groups and sulfurous functional groups can contribute to the electron donation from the nitrogenous groups and sulfurous groups to the CQDs based on the electron-withdrawing and electron-accepting behaviors of the functional groups toward the CQD. Increasing the electron density will lower the band gap85,86 of the CQDs. The N content of the CQDs increases in the order of CQD-N < CQD-C < CQD-T < CQD-D, and the S content increases in the order of CQD-D < CQD-N < CQD-C < CQD-T. In addition, the electron donating abilities of different nitrogenous and sulfurous functional groups are different. On the one hand, smaller size CQDs will lead to a larger band gap according to quantum confinement effects; on the other hand, more electron-donating functional groups on the surface of the CQD can lower the band gap. Therefore, the size of the CQD and the amount of electron-donating groups should be comprehensively considered for the band gap of CQDs. The experiments in this study illustrate that smaller CQDs show shorter emission wavelength, but have larger PL intensity. Peng et al.87 reported that as the size of the GQDs decreased their fluorescence emission was blue shifted. The previous ref. 78 and 79 have reported that electron rich N-doping can lower the work function of carbon. The Fermi energy level of the sensitized photoanode will vary with the change of the band gap of the CQD. As is known, Voc corresponds to the difference between the Fermi level of the quantum dot-sensitized photoanode and the redox potential of the electrolyte. It is found that the Voc of the QDSC increases as the band gap decreases from Table 4. In addition, the absorbance of the CQD increases with decreasing size, which is beneficial to generate a larger Jsc for QDSC. Shen et al.88 and Bai et al.89 reported that the absorbance enhancement of CQD-sensitized photoanodes can be attributed to the relatively small particle size and high percentage of carboxyl CO bonding, which improves the interaction of the CQD/TiO2 system by carboxylate fragment anchoring. Finally large Jsc and larger Voc are conducive to obtain a larger PCE. In conclusion, the relation among the particle size of the CQD, the characteristics of the CQD and the photoelectric properties of the QDSC is summarized in Fig. 11.

4 Conclusions
Absorbent cotton with different dopants (namely carbamide, thiourea, and 1,3-diaminopropane) has been employed to prepare doped CQDs via a one-pot hydrothermal method. The UV-vis and PL spectra of the three doped CQDs exhibit better optical properties compared with the undoped ones. The PCE of the doped QDSCs is 0.350%, 0.316%, and 0.527% respectively, much higher than that of the undoped one (0.176%). UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of CQD sensitized TiO2 and the calculated energy band structures of various CQDs are investigated, which provide a reasonable mechanism for the higher PCE. For the sake of the underlying reasons, the morphological and structural characteristics of the four CQDs have been studied in detail. It's found from the above analysis that a smaller size, a small band gap, and greater content of nitrogenous or sulphureous functional groups of CQDs are beneficial for enhanced light absorption performance and photo-excitation properties, which are helpful to improve the Jsc of QDSC. CQD-D has the smallest size, smallest band gap, and most content of heteroatomic functional groups, which makes its Jsc the largest. Nitrogen, acting as a donor to the CQDs, will assist the sensitized photoanode with a higher Fermi level, resulting in a larger Voc of QSDC. The N content of CQD-D is the largest among the four CQDs, which is the leading factor for the largest Voc. Finally this study builds the relation among the microstructure of the CQD, three characteristics of the CQD (namely the spectra, energy band structure and functional groups) and the photoelectric properties of the QDSC, which will provide guidance for the modulation doping of CQDs and lay a foundation for the further improvement of the QDSC efficiency.
