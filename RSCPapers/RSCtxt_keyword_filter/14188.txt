The complementary absorption ranges of binary photoactive components enable enhancing the visible light transmittance by diluting the polymer donor content in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) films. However, this strategy brings morphology defects to disturb the photovoltaic performance, producing inevitable compromise between the optical and electronic properties to confine the achievable light utilization efficiency (LUE). To maximize the LUE, we conduct comparative studies on two polymer donors to find out ways to alleviate the performance loss in diluted BHJ films. Importantly, we find that the short-circuit current (JSC) loss differs based on polymer aggregation type and its microscopic blend morphology. For one thing, more J-type polymer aggregations preserve the hole transporting pathway connection, and for another, the prioritized reduction of the polymer from pure domains rather than mixed domains helps maintain sufficient heterojunction area for exciton separation. Followed by compensation for the fill factor (FF) loss via addition of an n-dopant, we obtain a high LUE of 3.83% in binary component semitransparent organic solar cells (ST-OSCs) without device optical engineering design. Further deposition of a MoO3 layer boosts the LUE to 4.37%.
The discovery of non-fullerene (NFA) acceptors not only brings record power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 19% to organic solar cells (OSCs),1,2 but also extends the OSC application field from traditional solar farms to urban BIPV.3–5 For application in BIPV, OSCs have a unique advantage, which is the high-transparency due to the narrow and selective absorption spectra of organic photovoltaic materials.6 Since in state-of-the-art material combinations, the donor mainly absorbs in the visible light region and the acceptor absorbs in the infrared region, diluting the donor content in the blend film is effective in enhancing the average visible transmittance (AVT) of ST-OSCs.7–11 Using this strategy, a record intrinsic LUE of 3.65% has been produced by an AVT of 40.1% and a PCE of 9.1% without further optical engineering.10
Theoretically, ST-OSCs using the component dilution method have to face a critical challenge that is the compromise between the AVT and PCE in the polymer donor diluted blend film. Though the decreased content of the polymer donor is beneficial for the AVT enhancement, it inevitably harms the PCE by reducing the captured photons and disturbing the BHJ morphology. The worse BHJ morphology may originate from the decreased heterojunction area and discontinuous charge transporting pathway.12–15 The former is supposed to reduce JSC, while the latter has a large influence on FF. Recent developments on this strategy are initiated by the outstanding properties of 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((12,13-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]thieno[2′′,3′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]indole-2,10-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (Y6, see the chemical structure in Fig. S1†), which helps alleviate the morphology defect led performance loss in polymer donor diluted OSCs.
The unique advantages of Y6 in the diluted case include three aspects, the low exciton binding energy, the bipolar charge transport ability, and the fibril crystalline structure. Unlike the traditional fullerene derivatives, Y6 forms an intra-moiety state instead of a singlet state after photon excitation.16 The low binding energy of the intra-moiety state facilitates the formation of polarons within neat Y6, which provides an alternative photo-charge generation pathway to loosen the requirement on heterojunction area.17,18 Y6 also demonstrates relatively balanced bipolar transport ability for holes and electrons. Even with low donor content, the hole mobility still keeps at the order of 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, comparable to the common values in optimum BHJ devices.19 The good charge transport ability is related to its fibril crystalline, where the long axis grows along the (11−1) direction, and the width axis goes with the (020) direction.20 Since the Y6-series NFAs simultaneously possess good PCE and infra-red absorption in donor diluted BHJ devices, it is reasonable to develop ST-OSCs based on these materials.
To further boost the intrinsic LUE of the active layer, scientists have to search for a medium-gap polymer donor with a good tolerance of PCE to D:A ratio change to alleviate the photon and morphology induced performance loss. Herein, we started from a comparative study between two state-of-the-art polymer donors, namely PM6 and D18 (Fig. 1a). D18 differed from PM6 in a narrower absorption range and lower optimum D:A ratio in the BHJ device. According to the photovoltaic performance measurements, D18 displayed higher and more insensitive PCE dependence on componential reduction in diluted devices. After tracking the morphology evolution during the polymer dilution process, we found that more J-type aggregations and the prioritized reduction of the polymer from pure domains were responsible for the better PCE tolerance in D18 contained blend films. Together with applying an n-dopant (4-(1,3-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)phenyl)dimethylamine (N-DMBI), we obtained one of the highest LUEs of 3.83% in binary-component ST-OSCs without optical engineering optimization. This work unravels the entangled relationship between the optical and electric properties in diluted BHJ devices, and points out a feasible way to break through the LUE compromise in future ST-OSC fabrication.

We select PM6 and D18 to match with Y6 as paradigms for our comparative studies of donor diluted devices. We expect that the D18-based devices outperform the PM6-based devices due to the narrower absorption range (Fig. 1b) and a lower D:A ratio of 1:1.6 compared to 1:1.2 in optimal BHJ devices. A notable difference between the two polymers also lies in their aggregation type. According to the relative heights of the 0−0 and 0−1 absorption peaks in neat films (Fig. 1b), PM6 favors H-type aggregation, whereas more J-type aggregations appear in D18. As displayed in Fig. 1a, the H-type aggregation adopts face-to-face π stacking mode, whereas the J-type aggregation adopts head-to-tail π stacking mode.21 In principle, the J-type aggregation helps elongate the intermolecular conjugation length, which would help retain the hole transporting connection in the donor diluted BHJ film.22 The transmittance spectra of PM6:Y6 and D18:Y6 films with various D:A ratios are systematically compared under both the optimal device conditions and the same diluted concentrations in Fig. 1c and d. The transmittance of the D18:Y6 film reaches 42.05% under optimal device conditions, which is higher than 36.57% for the PM6:Y6 film. Accompanying with the polymer content reduction, the transmittance under visible light continuously enhances. The enhancement of AVT slows down over a D:A ratio of 0.30:1 for both material systems. At a D:A ratio of 0.30:1, the AVT of the D18:Y6 film reaches 59.82%, and the AVT of the PM6:Y6 film reaches 51.93% (Tables S1 and S2 in the ESI†). These observations are consistent with our expectation that the narrower absorption range makes D18 a more suitable candidate for application in ST-OSCs.
We then fabricated PM6:Y6 and D18:Y6 devices at various D:A ratios to reveal the influences of polymer donor dilution on photovoltaic performance. Under the optimal BHJ device conditions, the D18:Y6 device has a higher PCE of 18.01% than 16.70% in PM6:Y6 (Fig. 1e, f and Tables S3, S4 in the ESI†). This phenomenon lasts over all D:A ratios (Fig. 1g and Tables S3, S4 in the ESI†). The higher JSC values are responsible for these observations in D18:Y6 devices (supported by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements in Fig. S2 in the ESI†), though the FF reduces from 75.9% to 71.8% in the 0.20:1 diluted device (Fig. S3 in the ESI†). We simply evaluate their potential application in ST-OSCs by the product of active layer AVTs and the device PCEs at each dilution concentration. We find that the maximum product saturates at 0.30:1 in each material combination, and further dilution to 0.20:1 only slightly changes the value. Therefore, we use the films with a 0.30:1 blend ratio to represent the diluted morphology, and compare it with the BHJ morphology.
To understand the various behaviors of JSC and FF in PM6 and D18 contained OSCs, we then characterized the morphology evolution during the polymer diluting process. As analyzed at the very beginning of this work, the polymer dilution led to the loss of the hole transporting pathway and exciton splitting interface. The former is related to the polymer aggregation type, and the latter is related to the photoactive materials' miscibility. The material crystallinity plays mixed roles in both. We started from examining whether the PM6 and D18 in blend films aggregate in the same modes in the neat films. The absorption intensity was normalized with respect to the Y6 peak in Fig. 2a and b, since we fixed the Y6 content in blend films during dilution. The PM6 and D18 aggregation types were then obtained by using the blend film spectra subtracting the neat Y6 spectrum. As shown in the insets of Fig. 2a and b, more D18 molecules adopt J-type aggregation in blend films as compared to the neat films. We assume that the J-type aggregation is good to form a continuous hole transporting pathway at low polymer donor content. Aside from the polymer, Y6 absorption peaks slightly red-shift in both material systems, which indicates formation of stronger Y6 intermolecular stacking during polymer dilution.

The insets display the polymer signals by using the absorption spectra of blend films to deduct the Y6 spectrum. (c) Photoluminescence spectra obtained by respectively exciting at 520 nm (Y6 and blend films) and 400 nm (PM6 film).

(f) The cartoon of morphology evolution in PM6:Y6 and D18:Y6 blend films during the polymer diluting process. 
The polymer dilution in blend films also reduces the D:A heterojunction area, which is relevant to the JSC loss. Herein, we deduce the interfacial area from the photoluminescence (PL) spectra. As shown in Fig. 2c and d, the PL intensity increases with the donor content decent. We quantitatively estimate the PL signal increment by calculating the quenching efficiency (QE) with respect to the neat Y6 film. We see that though the QE of 97.1% in the PM6:Y6 BHJ film is slightly higher than 96.8% in the D18:Y6 BHJ film, it reduces to 83.7% and 73.1% at 0.30:1 and 0.20:1 blend ratios compared to those of 85.7% and 76.1% in D18:Y6 diluted films. The larger increment of QE reveals that the PM6:Y6 film loses more mixed regions during the polymer diluting process compared to the D18:Y6 film. This finding is consistent with the miscibility order between the polymer and Y6 from the surface energy measurements (Fig. S4†).
The deductions on morphology evolution during the polymer diluting process are well confirmed by the grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements (Fig. 2e). The scattering peaks representing the lamellar and π–π stackings of PM6 and D18 are close to the corresponding peaks in Y6 (Fig. S5†). Therefore, we used the merged scattering peaks at around 0.29 Å−1 and 1.73 Å−1 to evaluate the polymer:Y6 blend crystallinity in the alkyl side-chain and π–π stacking directions respectively (Fig. S6†). Due to the excessive content of Y6 in both kinds of blend films, we observe the (11−1) peak at 0.38 Å−1 in all line-cuts of Fig. 2e, indicating the existence of pure Y6 crystalline regions in normal and diluted BHJ films. Interestingly, we also observe the D18 (002) peak at 0.55 Å−1, which reveals the existence of pure D18 crystallites in the blend films. The information of morphology evolution during polymer dilution can be obtained from these peaks. In PM6:Y6 films, the PM6 reduction leads to simultaneous crystallinity enhancement in the merged peaks representing the lamellar and π–π stacking, where the mixed coherence lengths (CLs) increase from 65.75 Å to 67.32 Å, and 24.91 Å to 26.55 Å. The CL of the Y6 (11−1) peak also increases from 30.57 Å to 39.82 Å (Table S5†). A rational explanation for this phenomenon is that the reduced PM6 comes from the PM6:Y6 mixed regions, and therefore it can increase the Y6 crystallinity without disturbing the PM6 crystalline domain. Apparently, the diluted blend morphology with less mixed regions harms the JSC. In D18:Y6 films, we observe opposite crystallinity changes according to the D18 (002) peak and Y6 (11−1) peak respectively. The CL of the D18 (002) significantly decreases from 188.51 Å to 144.54 Å. At the same time, the CL of the Y6 (11−1) increases from 43.52 Å to 46.71 Å (Table S6†). The opposite crystallinity variations point out that the reduced D18 mainly comes from the pure D18 crystalline domain. Accordingly, the worse domain purity is responsible for the FF decrease in D18:Y6 diluted films. Keeping all the above information in mind, we summarize the different situations of polymer dilution led morphology change in Fig. 2f. Although the D18:Y6 films mainly lose pure D18 domains during dilution, the more polymer J-type aggregations help retain the hole transporting pathway connection in the diluted BHJ film to alleviate the JSC loss.
Though D18 is more suitable for fabricating ST-OSCs due to the optical and morphology characteristics, the FF loss in diluted devices still limits their ultimate LUE value. The sacrificed domain purity with less D18 content is hard to be compensated by traditional optimization methods; however, our recent findings reveal dopant addition as a feasible strategy to enhance the FF in such imperfect morphology.15,23 We chose N-DMBI as an n-dopant (Fig. S1†), and added it separately to the D18:Y6 and PM6:Y6 diluted BHJ film.24,25 Interestingly, we find that the N-DMBI can enhance the PCE of D18:Y6 diluted BHJ devices at all studied ratios from 0.25:1 to 0.35:1, which is mainly ascribed to the better FF (Fig. 3a, Table 1 and Fig. S7, Tables S7–S9†). In comparison, the PM6:Y6 diluted devices at these D:A ratios are not beneficial from the n-dopant addition, which is consistent with our previous reports (Fig. S8 and Tables S10–S12†).14 It seems that the effectiveness of n-dopant addition is also related to the polymer phase in blend films, and less mixed regions would help n-dopant function in diluted films. Looking into the blend films by atomic force microscopy (AFM), we observe no obvious morphology change after n-dopant addition in both PM6:Y6 and D18:Y6 diluted samples (Fig. S9†). The best PCE comes at the D:A ratio of 0.30:1, where the n-dopant addition increases the FF from 72.9% to 75.7%. Together with the slight JSC increment from 25.74 mA cm−2 to 25.89 mA cm−2 and VOC increment from 0.851 V to 0.853 V, n-dopant addition boosts the overall PCE from 15.97% to 16.71% (Table 1). Since the n-dopant addition does not increase the saturated current density at large reverse bias (Fig. S10†), the device enhancement must come from the reduced recombination.

To correlate the FF increment with charge recombination after n-dopant addition, we extracted the dark (n) and illuminated (S) device ideality factors respectively from the dark current density versus voltage curves and the light-dependent VOC curves (Fig. S11†). We observe that n decreases from 1.46, 1.59, and 1.90 to 1.37, 1.49, and 1.70 respectively at D:A ratios of 0.35:1, 0.30:1 and 0.25:1 (Fig. 3b and Table 1). The S variations are consistent with the dark results, where S reduces from 1.19, 1.28 and 1.40 kBT/q to 1.06, 1.08 and 1.10 kBT/q at the same D:A ratios (Fig. 3c and Table 1). The larger ideality factor is close to the morphology change during polymer dilution, where the low content of D18 inhibits the original hole transporting pathway in pure D18 domains, and alternatively more holes transport through the Y6 domains. Therefore, the cut-off D18 domains act as the morphological traps to hurt the device performance. The morphological traps can be compensated by tuning the Y6 energetic landscape via n-dopant addition. As observed, both n and S in all three D:A ratios reduce after n-dopant addition, revealing less trap-assisted recombination in the n-type doped D18 diluted devices.
In order to further confirm that the better FF is mainly from the suppressed trap-assisted recombination rather than the bimolecular recombination, we measured transporting curves with and without N-DMBI (Fig. S12†), and calculated the Langevin pre-factor γpre by using the following equation:26 (1)where JD represents the double-carrier current, and Jp(n) denotes the hole (electron) current density (see details in ref. 23). The γpre values are separately 0.084, 0.072, and 0.044 for devices with D:A ratios of 0.35:1, 0.30:1, and 0.25:1. N-DMBI addition does not change γpre significantly (Table S13†). Though N-DMBI addition leads to more balanced hole and electron mobility in the D18 diluted devices (Fig. 3d, e, Table S13†), the small value of γpre reveals that the bimolecular recombination does not contribute significantly to the operation of D18 diluted devices.11,27 The light-intensity JSC plots are also displayed (Fig. S13†) to estimate the extent of bimolecular recombination in diluted devices. The similar values in three diluted ratios with and without N-DMBI addition support the conclusions above. Finally, we measured the charge densities before and after N-DMBI addition in all three D:A ratio devices from impedance spectra. Under the metal–insulator–semiconductor (MIS) device structure (inset of Fig. 3f), the charge density keeps almost constant after adding a relatively small amount of n-dopant (Fig. 3f, S14 and Table S14†). The unchanged charge density also supports that the bimolecular recombination is not significantly influenced by N-DMBI, since the bimolecular recombination rate is proportional to the square of the charge density. Alternatively, the unchanged charge density demonstrates that the N-DMBI addition fills the traps rather than contributes to the free carriers in the diluted BHJ films.28
With the optimum optical and photovoltaic performance in the diluted D18:Y6 BHJ film, we fabricated ST-OSCs with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/D18:Y6 diluted film (with N-DMBI)/PDINO/ultra-thin Ag (Fig. 4a). We sequentially optimized the ST-OSC devices by considering three factors: the Ag thickness, the active layer thickness, and the filter layer to obtain the best LUE value producing by PCE and AVT (LUE = PCE × AVT). The Ag thickness was selected as 10 nm and 15 nm according to previous reports on fabricating ST-OSC devices.29–32 As illustrated with D:A ratio variation from 0.25:1 to 0.35:1 (Fig. S15 and Tables S15–S17†), we observe that the ST-OSC devices with a 10 nm-thick Ag electrode demonstrate better AVT but worse PCE than those with a 15 nm-thick Ag electrode (Table 2). Higher LUE values are obtained by depositing the 10 nm-thick Ag electrode. The best LUE of 3.43% is obtained with a D18:Y6 ratio of 0.30:1, where the PCE of 13.02% is produced by a JSC of 20.53 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.858 V, and FF of 73.9% (Fig. 4b and Table 2). Under these conditions, the device AVT achieves 26.37% (Fig. 4c). We then reduced the active layer thickness to further enhance the LUE. Interestingly, we find that reducing the active layer thickness from 100 nm to 70 nm does not lead to a large JSC loss (Fig. 4b and Table 2). JSC only changes from 20.53 mA cm−2 to 20.21 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4b and Table 2). The slightly higher VOC and FF help compensate for the JSC reduction, where the PCE of 12.97% is almost the same as the 100 nm-thick active layer device. Under these conditions, the AVT increases to 29.57%, producing an LUE of 3.83%. We compare this value with previous reports on ST-OSCs without depositing the optical layer, and we highlight that we obtain one of the best intrinsic LUE values among the binary component material systems (Fig. 4d and Table S18,† the related references are listed as S2–S20 in the ESI†). Furthermore, the quantum utilization efficiency (QUE) determined by EQE + T (T is the transmittance) is used to elucidate the light energy utilization of ST-OSCs. The credible ST-OSC performance should demonstrate a QUE value less than 90% in the entire spectral region, owing to the unavoidable photon and carrier loss (including non-radiative or intrinsic recombination, interfacial reflection in the device, parasitic absorption, etc.).8,33,34 The transmittance spectra as well as QUE curves of devices here are displayed in Fig. 4c and S16.† It is seen that the maximum QUE of these devices is below 85%, confirming the reliability of our ST-OSC measurements. When we deposited an additional 35 nm MoO3 layer on top of the ST-OSCs, we obtain the best LUE of 4.37% (Fig. 4d) with an AVT of 37.31% and PCE of 11.71% (Table 2). Since the MoO3 layer selectively blocks the photons in the infra-red region and allows the photons near 550 nm to pass through, the color coordinate correspondingly shifts from (0.286, 0.280) to (0.286, 0.287) (Fig. 4e and S17†). The color coordinate approaching the AM1.5G solar spectrum point (0.332, 0.343) suggests our ST-OSC device has neutral color characteristics, which is visualized by the photographs taken through the devices (Fig. 4f). As shown in Table S19,† the correlated color temperature (CCT) and color rendering index (CRI) are also given for evaluating the optical properties of ST-OSCs. CCT of the optimized ST-OSCs with and without MoO3 is 9326 K and 9748 K, respectively. In addition, the CRI values are 92.49 and 90.93 for ST-OSCs with and without MoO3, exhibiting a high color rendering ability. The high LUE value and color fidelity already satisfy the application requirements for façade-integrated photovoltaics.35

In conclusion, we conduct a paradigm study on how to enhance the AVT with reduced PCE loss in polymer donor diluted BHJ devices, aiming to maximize the LUE in ST-OSCs. Beyond the optical consideration, such as the polymer absorption range and its optimal D:A ratio in BHJ films, we find that the polymer aggregation type and the microscopic morphology evolution play a crucial role in maintaining the PCE value during the polymer donor diluting process. Briefly, more J-type aggregations are favoured to keep the hole transporting pathway connected in the diluted BHJ film. At the same time, the prioritized polymer reduction from its pure domain makes the devices avoid large JSC drop by reserving sufficient interfacial area for exciton splitting. The reduced FF due to the decrease of the pure polymer phase can be improved by n-dopant addition, which helps alleviate the morphology defect led trap-assisted recombination. Combined with the morphological and n-dopant's benefits, we obtain a high intrinsic LUE of 3.83% among the binary component material systems. Simple deposition of an optical layer of MoO3 can further enhance the LUE to 4.37%. We believe that the insights on the morphology evolution during the component diluting process will inspire future material design rules to achieve practical application in ST-OSCs.
