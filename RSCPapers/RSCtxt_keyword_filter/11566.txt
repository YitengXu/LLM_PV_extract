    , Accepted 19th October 2018First published on 20th October 2018AbstractPrecise control of crystal orientations and macroscopic morphology of a perovskite crystal is crucial for various optoelectronic applications relying on charge carrier transport tuning along exposed crystal facets. Here, taking methylammonium lead bromide (CH3NH3PbBr3) as an example, and employing a novel crystal facet engineering method, we successfully construct two kinds of perovskite crystals with exposed {001} and {110} facets. We find that the free carriers’ photoluminescence lifetime on the {001} facets can be 3 times longer than that on {110} facets. The related mechanisms are investigated via fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy and in situ transmission electron microscopy. These indicate that the different trap state density of exposed facets and crystal structure changing of CH3NH3PbBr3 under light and electron beam irradiation lead to the differences in carrier transport along different facets. By distinguishing the charge carrier transport on different CH3NH3PbBr3 exposed facets, micro-photodetectors have been constructed. A device fabricated with the {001} exposed facets exhibited two orders of magnitude higher photocurrent and half as much dark current as a {110} facet-based device. Thus, the crystal facet engineering of perovskites can be widely adopted for understanding physical/chemical properties of perovskite crystals and provides great potential for novel perovskite optoelectronic device applications.
1. Introduction
Owing to their distinctive structural and optoelectronic properties, organolead halide [APbX3, A = MA (CH3NH3, methylammonium), or FA (NH = CHNH3, formamidinium); X = Cl, Br and I] perovskites have attracted intense attention for various optoelectronic applications, such as solar cells (PSCs),1–5 light-emitting diodes,6,7 photodetectors8,9 and lasers.10,11 The power conversion efficiency of PSCs has jumped from just 3.8%1,12,13 to over 23%14,15 in less than 10 years. The research efforts were mainly focused on improving the crystal quality and suppressing carrier recombination via minimizing grain boundaries and crystal defects during perovskite film formation.16–19 As a solid material, no matter single crystal or polycrystalline film, the intense anisotropy of MAPbX3 directly affects the carrier transport.20,21 Through the investigation on polycrystalline perovskite thin films in a solar cell, a recent result has confirmed that density variations in trap states would change the Fermi level and recombination rates of different facets and further lead to different photovoltaic properties.20 Compared with a perovskite polycrystalline film, a perovskite single crystal exhibits fewer grain boundaries and crystal defects, resulting in higher carrier mobility, longer carrier diffusion length, and higher stability and durability.22–26 The crystal facet engineering strategy, which adopts precise synthesis methods to prepare a crystalline material with different exposed facets, is a common method employed for various physical/chemical applications, such as in semiconductor sectors, catalyst design and energy storage device fabrication.27–30 However, at present, there is very limited research focusing on the crystal facet engineering of perovskite crystals, and the studies on their applications for perovskite-based optoelectronic devices are even fewer.28 Thus, it is crucial to investigate perovskite crystals’ facet engineering and to explore its possibilities in various optoelectronic fields.31
Due to its typical cubic structure and wide emissive cross-sections, in the present study, CH3NH3PbBr3 is chosen as a representative perovskite for investigating the carrier transport.32 Dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) and oleylammonium bromide (OAB) are selected as templates and two kinds of CH3NH3PbBr3 crystalline materials, namely, a single plate with {001} facets and a single rod with {110} facets, are synthesized. Through steady state and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy measurements, the carrier transport along the surface of a CH3NH3PbBr3 single plate and single rod are studied in detail and the results are further verified by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Finally, micro-photodetectors are constructed on different exposed facets of perovskite to further validate the potential of crystal facet engineering in such a type of material.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials and reagents
PbBr2, CH3NH2, HBr, oleylamine and DTAB were purchased from Aladdin Co. Ltd and used as received.
2.2 Synthesis of CH3NH3Br
First, hydrobromic acid (15 mL, 48 wt% in water, Aladdin Co. Ltd) was mixed with methylamine (25 mL, 30–33% in methanol, Aladdin Co. Ltd) in an ice-water bath and stirred for 2 h in a flask. After that, the flask was placed onto a hot plate at 50 °C under stirring to remove the solvent. The reaction product, CH3NH3Br, was washed with ethanol by stirring the mixture for 30 min. The precipitate was then centrifuged three times with anhydrous diethyl ether and dried at 80 °C in a convection oven overnight. The derived CH3NH3Br was in the form of a white powder.
2.3 Synthesis of OAB
Ethanol (100 mL, Aladdin Co. Ltd, absolute, >99.8%) and oleylamine (12.5 mL, Aladdin Co. Ltd, 80–90%) were combined in a 250 mL two-necked flask and vigorously stirred. The reaction mixture was cooled in an ice-water bath, and HBr (8.56 mL, 48 wt% in water, Aladdin Co. Ltd) was added. The reaction mixture was left to react overnight under N2 flow. Then, the solution was dried under vacuum, and the obtained product was purified by rinsing several times with diethyl ether. The product (white powder) was obtained after vacuum drying at 80 °C overnight.
2.4 Synthesis of CH3NH3PbBr3 single plates
30 μL CH3NH3PbBr3 (0.7 M) solution in DMF was rapidly injected into 1 mL DTAB (0.1–0.5 mM) solution in γ-butyrolactone under stirring at room temperature. Right after, the mixed colloid solutions were annealed in a constant temperature oven at 60 °C for 30 min to remove part of the solvents, which would be beneficial for further aging and assembling of a CH3NH3PbBr3 single plate, and then the solution was dropped onto a coverslip substrate. Finally the solvents evaporated, and the microstructures were obtained.
2.5 Synthesis of CH3NH3PbBr3 single rods
30 μL CH3NH3PbBr3 (0.7 M) solution in DMF was rapidly injected into 1 mL OTB (0.5–1 mM) solution in γ-butyrolactone under stirring at room temperature. Right after, the mixed colloid solutions were annealed in a constant temperature oven at 60 °C for 30 min to remove part of the solvents, which would be beneficial for further aging and assembling of a CH3NH3PbBr3 single rod, and then the solution was dropped onto a coverslip substrate. Finally the solvents evaporated, and the microstructures were obtained.
2.6 Characterization of CH3NH3PbBr3 crystals
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Rigaku D/MAX 2500 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at 40 kV and 200 mA. The scan rate was 5° min−1 and the step size was 0.02°. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed using a Hitachi S-4800 field-emission scanning electron microscope operating at 10.0 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were also made on CH3NH3PbBr3 samples deposited onto holey carbon copper grids using a JEOL-2100F instrument and the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were recorded. In order to minimise the sample degradation due to environmental factors, the samples were placed in a sealed, nitrogen-filled container immediately after deposition; they were then quickly placed into the TEM.
2.7 Optical measurements
The fluorescence spectra of the samples were measured with a Hitachi F-7000 instrument combined with an external laser source. The diameter of the laser spot was controlled below 10 μm and located in the sample center with an excitation power of 50 mW. The optical absorption spectra of the samples were collected using a Shimidazu UV-2600 spectrophotometer. PL images and confocal images were taken with an Olympus FluoView-500 inverted microscope. The FTIR spectra were recorded using a BRUKER IR microscope (TENSOR-27).
2.8 
          In situ TEM characterization

In situ TEM experiments were performed at room temperature inside a JEOL-2100F instrument equipped with an optical TEM holder (Nanofactory Instruments AB). A multimode fiber (Nanonics Imaging, Ltd) was inserted into the holder. The fiber was connected to a 405 nm laser diode (Thorlabs, Inc.). Special care was taken to get a pristine, undamaged structure during sample preparation. In order to minimise degradation due to environmental factors, the samples were placed in a sealed, nitrogen-filled container immediately after deposition and were then quickly loaded into the TEM. In order to minimise possible electron beam-induced artefacts, low-dose TEM imaging conditions with an electron dose rate of ∼2 e Å−2 s−1 were used in this study. A high contrast objective aperture was used to increase the contrast of the bright-field images. The whole experimental processes were: (1) laser off and electron beam on to get the structure image of the sample; (2) laser on for a few minutes (electron beam off); and (3) after that the electron beam on (did not turn off the laser) and an image taken quickly.
2.9 Device fabrication
Planar-type photodetector devices were fabricated by depositing 140 nm Au electrodes via vacuum evaporation on the CH3NH3PbBr3 crystallites with an average deposition rate of 0.4 Å s−1. The gap between two electrodes was about 20 μm. Special care was taken to have a pristine, undamaged structure during electrode deposition. In order to minimise degradation due to environmental factors, the samples were placed in a sealed, nitrogen-filled container and were then quickly loaded into the thermal evaporator.
2.10 Device characterization
All device performance characteristics were recorded in an optically and electrically sealed box (filled with nitrogen) to minimize electromagnetic and environmental disturbances. The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the photodetectors were analyzed using an Agilent 4156C semiconductor parameter analyzer. Electrically screened high-precision triaxial probes and cables were used during photocurrent recording and the background current was as low as 10 fA. A monochromatic light source for photoresponse testing was a 350 nm LED (Thorlabs M530L3) modulated by a waveform generator (Agilent 33600A Series). The time responses of photodetectors to light illumination were measured by a current meter after shutting off the UV-light.
3. Results and discussion
As shown in Fig. 1a, at room temperature the cubic crystalline phase of CH3NH3PbBr3 with high symmetry has an isotropy in three dimensions, which would facilitate the isotropic crystal growth along all three orientations. In order to mold a CH3NH3PbBr3 crystal into a particular morphology, specific templates are needed to control the growth kinetics by inducing nucleation and growth along the particular orientation.33 The perovskite samples with different exposed facets were synthesized by a surfactant-assisted liquid-phase self-assembly technique. Fig. 1b and c show the real images of a single plate induced by DTAB and a single rod induced by OAB obtained using a fluorescence microscope under 405 nm light excitation. The green light emission of the two CH3NH3PbBr3 samples with different exposed facets is quite homogeneous, but the CH3NH3PbBr3 plate shows much stronger light emission under the same excitation conditions.

Fig. 1d illustrates the detailed growth processes of CH3NH3PbBr3 crystals: in γ-butyrolactone, ammonium surfactants generated spherical micelles in the absence of CH3NH3PbBr3. After the introduction of CH3NH3PbBr3 into the system, sphere-to-plate or sphere-to-rod transitions of DTAB or OAB were induced and the amino cationic groups were taken out of the micelle surface. The hydrogen bonds interacting within exposed cationic groups on the surfactant templates and Br− ions from CH3NH3PbBr3 play the critical role for the selective growth of a crystal. For a single plate, the DTAB surfactant preferentially binds with Br− of the {001} crystal facets and induces the crystal growth along the 〈110〉 directions. In contrast, the OAB surfactant selectively covers the {110} crystal facets, and induces the crystal growth along 〈001〉 orientations. Because the spacing between two adjacent Br− for a single rod (0.83 nm) is 20.5 times larger compared with a single plate (0.59 nm), the distances for the surfactant are influenced by the carbon atoms numbers of the substituent group and will directly affect the result (the detailed material synthesis processes can be found in the Experimental section).34–36
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the two CH3NH3PbBr3 samples are shown in Fig. 2a and b. These reveal that the smooth surfaces of the CH3NH3PbBr3 single plate induced by DTAB make a square with ∼80 μm sides, whereas the single rod induced by OAB creates a rectangle with ∼20 μm width (the low-magnification optical images of the as-prepared CH3NH3PbBr3 plates and rods can be seen in Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns in Fig. 2c and d indicate the high quality single crystalline plate and rod growing along 〈001〉 and 〈110〉 directions, respectively. Thus, the crystal facet engineering method proposed in this study works well in fabricating perovskite crystals with preferable exposed facets. This provides the possibility for novel optoelectrical appications. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns in Fig. 2e further indicate the high crystalline quality of the prepared CH3NH3PbBr3 crystals.

Scale bars are 20 μm for (a) and (b) and 8 μm for (c) and (d). 
The optical absorption spectra of the CH3NH3PbBr3 single plate and single rod (Fig. 3a) samples were then investigated. The absorption band edge is ∼563 nm (2.20 eV) for both samples (Tauc plots of the absorption spectra are shown in Fig. S3 in the ESI†). The steady state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy measurements of the CH3NH3PbBr3 single plate and single rod samples with different exposure facets were conducted. As shown in Fig. 3b, the PL peak positions are ∼542 nm and ∼544 nm for the single plate and single rod samples, respectively. The PL yield of the single plate is much higher than that of the single rod under the same excitation conditions, indicating the higher radiative recombination of photoexcited carriers within the single plate. The non-radiative recombination derived from the surface trap density is higher in the single rod sample. Next, we investigated the relaxation processes of the photogenerated free charge carriers in the two CH3NH3PbBr3 crystallites with different exposed facets by means of TRPL spectroscopy (as shown in Fig. 3c). When excitated at 405 nm, the average time constants are 18.04 ns and 5.64 ns for the single plate and single rod (the fitting parameters can be found in Table S1, ESI†), respectively. The PL lifetime of the single plate is more than 3 times longer than that of the single rod, indicating that the radiative recombination of photoexcited free carriers within {001} CH3NH3PbBr3 facets is higher due to fewer defects within such facets.12,15,37,38 Thus, in order to reduce the nonradiative carrier recombination and improve the diffusion length of photogenerated carriers, the {001} exposed facets of CH3NH3PbBr3 are more preferable. Furthermore, the fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) measurements were carried out to obtain information regarding the free carrier lifetime within the different perovskite crystals. The real images taken during the experiments are presented in Fig. 3d and e and the fluorescence lifetime distribution diagram is shown in Fig. 3f. From the FLIM measurements, one can conclude that the free carrier lifetime of the single rod sample is much shorter than that of the single plate sample, which may be due to the high trap-state density and poor crystallinity of the single rod perovskite crystal (Fig. 3d and e).39

The optoelectronic response of a device can be easily tuned via this crystal facet engineering method40 and the strong anisotropy properties of free carrier transport within the different CH3NH3PbBr3 facets can be applied in various optoelectronic devices. Thus, photodetector devices based on the CH3NH3PbBr3 single plate and single rod structures were fabricated and their optoelectronic responses under different light irradiation and external electrical fields were investigated in detail. Fig. 4a shows the schematic and a real image of the Au electrode deposition shadow mask for the micro-photodetector construction, which is constructed according to our previous findings (the detailed device fabrication processes can be found in the Experimenal section, ESI†).41

(a) Schematic and a real image of the Au electrode deposition shadow mask for the micro-photodetector construction; (b) time-dependent photocurrent responses of the CH3NH3PbBr3 single plate- and single rod-based devices, photocurrent rise and drop at a voltage of 5 V with an on–off light (light wavelength is 350 nm with an intensity of 1.32 mW cm−2); (c and d) I–V curves of the CH3NH3PbBr3 single plate and single rod devices under dark conditions and under illumination (light wavelength is 350 nm with an intensity of 1.32 mW cm−2). 

Fig. 4b presents the time dependent photoresponse of the photodetectors measured under periodic illumination with a monochromatic 350 nm light source (with an intensity of 1.32 mW cm−2) under ambient air and room temperature conditions. The photocurrent increased to a stable value of ∼350 nA for the single plate-based device and just to ∼3.4 nA for the single rod-based device, and then significantly decreased to its initial value after the light was turned off. This indicates a quick transfer from the optical to the electrical signal in both devices. There is no significant current loss after several cycles of turning the light on and off, suggesting excellent stability and reproducibility of the dynamic photoresponse. The light-to-dark current ratio was more than 750 for the single plate based device, whereas it was just 3.8 for the single rod-based device. The rise time of the single plate photodetector was much shorter than that of the single rod photodetector (as can be seen in Fig. S4, ESI†), indicating the shorter response time of the single plate sample. The I–V characteristics of the two photodetectors were measured by sweeping the voltage from −5 V to 5 V under dark and light conditions, as shown in Fig. 4c and d. Under a 5 V bias, the dark currents for both perovskite devices are less than 1 nA, lower than that for most perovskite films and single crystal photodetectors.9,42 The low dark currents probably resulted from the removal of the surfactants [the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) results can be seen in Fig. S5 and S6, ESI†] from the sample surfaces since the surfactants may affect the charge carrier extraction/transport at the perovskite/electrode interface.8 For the fabrication of high performance perovskite optoelectronic devices with the crystal facet engineering method, more attention should be paid to the removal of the surfactants.

I–V characteristics of the single plate photodetector fabricated with the {001} CH3NH3PbBr3 facets showed more linear character, suggesting that the Au electrode and single plate sample formed an ohmic contact; while the Au electode and CH3NH3PbBr3 single rod sample created a Schottky contact.8 As mentioned above, both CH3NH3PbBr3 crystals were grown in just a few minutes; so the crystal formation rate for the single rod could be as high as 10 μm min−1, thus the trap defect on the surface of the single rod caused by such fast growth might affect the contact.43 These results demonstrate that micro-photodetectors based on the CH3NH3PbBr3 single plate have better potential for photon detection than their single rod counterparts.
Based on the results above, the CH3NH3PbBr3 single plate was chosen to study its photoresponse over a wide incident light wavelength range. Fig. 5a and b show the comparative I–V linear and logarithmic plots of the CH3NH3PbBr3 single plate photodetector photoresponses under different light irradiation and under dark conditions. The photocurrents increased with a change in the wavelength from 300 nm to 500 nm for the device. All values are much higher than the current under dark conditions and the photocurrent reached the extreme values at the wavelengths of 450–500 nm. This indicates that the photodetector fabricated with the CH3NH3PbBr3 single plate can nicely work over the wide wavelength range of 300–500 nm. When the wavelength of the incident light was at 550 nm and above, the photocurrent drastically reduced (as can be seen in Fig. S7 and S8, ESI†). This might be caused by the fact that the incident light wavelength becomes close to the absorption edge (∼563 nm) of the CH3NH3PbBr3 single plate.
 Fig. 5  Photoresponse and in situ TEM results of CH3NH3PbBr3 single plate samples. (a and b) Linear and logarithmic plots of I–V curves of a CH3NH3PbBr3 single plate device illuminated with different light wavelengths; (c and d) in situ SAED images of an individual CH3NH3PbBr3 single plate under 405 nm laser off and on, the red circles in (d) indicate the appearance of additional electron diffraction spots after shining a laser. 
To further investigate the photogenerated carrier transport along the specific facets, an advanced laser-assisted in situ TEM system44–47 was constructed. Fig. 5c and d show the SAED patterns of the CH3NH3PbBr3 single plate before and after irradiation with a 405 nm laser (details of the setup and experiment can be found in the Experimental section). Before irradiation, the electron diffraction spots confirm the characteristic crystal properties of a CH3NH3PbBr3 material, which are in good agreement with recent results.48,49 After laser irradiation, some additional electron diffraction spots appeared, as shown in Fig. 5d. The appearance of these spots (such as 3/2, 1/2, and 0) indicates that a small crystal structure change (may be a degradation process) has been formed within the perovskite plate.50 But our next attempt to get the clear crystal change data of the CH3NH3PbBr3 single rod through the same in situ TEM approach failed because of too rapid degradation of the sample under the electron beam (as can be seen in Fig. S9 and S10, ESI†). Organolead halide perovskite has rather poor stability and will degrade under the high energy electron beam, following the process:51CH3NH3PbBr3 + e− → (CH2) + NH3 + HBr + PbBr2
The degradation process is more likely to occur on the defect sites. Thus, more defects are generated on the surface of the CH3NH3PbBr3 single rod sample, consistent with the above-discussed optical characterization results. With regard to chemical bonds, the energy conversion system (e.g. optoelectronics, lithium-ion batteries, catalysis), can be tuned via changing of chemical bonds' types, numbers, orbital, and/or spin states within a crystal facet, which is named as Atom-Realm (AR) Effect (Y-W rule).52,53 This may be promising for the fabrication of various high performance optoelectronic devices by adding external (magnetic) fields into the light absorption layer (AR-LAL), electron transport layer (AR-ETL), or hole transport layer (AR-HTL) with AR effect.
4. Conclusions
We controllably synthesized two kinds of CH3NH3PbBr3 crystals with the {001} and {110} exposed facets through an original crystal facet engineering method and compared the transport behavior of photogenerated carriers on different CH3NH3PbBr3 facets. While analyzing steady-state PL and TRPL spectra, we proposed that {001} facets are better options for photogenerated free carrier transport. FLIM and micro-photodetector studies provided evidence that the trap density on different exposed facets could indeed affect the carrier transport. Based on the changes of electon diffraction patterns after shining a laser onto the samples using an in situ TEM technique, we concluded that the light-induced crystal structure change of CH3NH3PbBr3 within the single plate had taken place. The described crystal facet engineering method is promising for the realization of various perovskite-based optoelectronic devices due to its simplicity and effectiveness with respect to perovskite optoelectronic response tuning.
