    , Accepted 10th March 2022First published on 14th March 2022AbstractAll-small-molecule organic solar cells (ASM-OSCs) have attracted considerable attention owing to their excellent batch-to-batch reproducibility. Herein, two new small molecules with alkoxyphenyl- and alkthiophenyl-substituted benzodithiophene (BDT) as the central building block named BDT-O and BDT-S were successfully synthesized and employed as donors in ASM-OSCs. With a single atom variation from O to S, the crystallization behavior of BDT-S was efficiently modulated, due to the difference of electron withdrawing ability between two atoms. Moreover, post-treatment is an effective method to influence morphology and crystallinity of the active layer for ASM-OSCs. The BDT-S:Y6-BO blend film, applied with the DIO additive, displayed a smoother surface, proper crystallinity, a more face-on preferred orientation and a better nano interpenetrating network phase separation morphology than that of the BDT-O:Y6-BO blend film, resulting in more effective and balanced carrier mobilities. Therefore, upon adding the DIO additive, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of BDT-S- and BDT-O-based devices has reached 14.3% and 12.06% with a high short-circuit current density (JSC) of 25.14 mA cm−2 and 23.07 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 68.3% and 64.02%, respectively. This work gives an effective strategy to modify side-chains for developing more effective small molecule donors.
Introduction
Due to the advantages of low-cost, light weight and flexibility, organic solar cells (OSCs), as important renewable energy devices, have attracted more and more attention and a PCE of 19% for single-junction OSCs was obtained.1–3 With the successful development of high-performance non-fullerene receptor materials ITIC4 and Y6,5 the PCE values of OSCs were dramatically enhanced in the past few years.6–8 Nevertheless, almost all non-fullerene OSCs with a high PCE of over 17% adopted polymers as donors.9 Compared with polymer donors, the advantages of small molecule donors (SMDs) are reflected in the simple synthesis, easy purification and good batch stability, which are suitable for large-scale production.10,11 However, the PCE is still far behind that of polymer-based OSCs. Therefore, it is urgent to develop more effective donor materials to achieve high performance ASM-OSCs.
Numerous studies revealed that highly efficient photovoltaic materials must meet several requirements simultaneously: broad and strong absorption in the visible-NIR region, suitable energy levels, high carrier mobility, good solubility and film-forming properties, and especially an appropriate aggregation size and interpenetrating network structure between the donor and acceptor.12–14 As for small molecule donors, it is considerably difficult to form nano-scaled interpenetrating network phase separation with non-fullerene acceptors, resulting in a low JSC and FF in ASM-OSCs devices. Recently, side-chain engineering has been employed as one of the most important molecular design strategies to improve photovoltaic performance by optimizing the morphology of the active layer.15–17 Many researchers have made outstanding progress in adopting the strategies of lengthening of alkyl chains,18 extension of the conjugation length,19 and variation from thiophene to the benzene ring.20 Min's group designed three molecular donors with different substituents in the central core, showing more efficient and balanced charge transport properties when an alkylthio-substituent was used.21 However, previous research studies have not yet fully investigated the crystallinity modulation of the heteroatom effect. In addition to molecular structure modification, device optimization can also obviously improve the performance of OSCs. Solvent additives and thermal/solvent annealing are widely applied in improving the morphology of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs. 1,8-Diiodooctane (DIO) is one of the most popular additives used to enhance the performance of a device, and multiple studies have clearly revealed the mechanism in depth.22–24 Therefore, both molecular design and device optimization play a critical role in achieving high-efficiency ASM-OSCs.
Herein, two new small molecules with two different side-chains, alkoxyphenyl- and alkthiophenyl-substituted BDT as the central building block named BDT-O and BDT-S, respectively, were successfully designed and synthesized. The effects of heteroatom side-chains on crystallinity, molecular packing, morphology and photovoltaic performance are revealed in detail. With a single atom variation from O to S, alkthiophenyl-substituted BDT-S possessed a broader absorption, lower energy levels, and more suitable crystallinity and phase separation than those of alkoxyphenyl-substituted BDT-O. Meanwhile, the photovoltaic performances were investigated by using Y6-BO25 as the acceptor to match the donors and compared the influence of the two post-treatment processes. As a result, when adding DIO as a solvent additive, the BDT-S:Y6-BO DIO-based ASM-OSCs presented a higher PCE of 14.3%, with a notable JSC of 25.14 mA cm−2 and an FF of 68.30%, while BDT-O:Y6-BO DIO-based devices obtained a lower PCE of 12.06% with a JSC of 23.07 mA cm−2 and an FF of 64.02%. These results elucidated that heteroatom side-chain engineering of small molecule donors can be an efficient approach to further enhance the PCE of ASM-OSCs.
Results and discussion
The chemical structure of the two small molecule donors and the device configuration of the OSCs are shown in Fig. 1a and b. The detailed synthesis route and specific characterization data of BDT-S and BDT-O are shown in the ESI (Scheme S1 and Fig. S1–S6†). The energy level distributions of BDT-S and BDT-O are depicted in Fig. 1c and Table 1, and the cyclic voltammetry (CV) graph is shown in Fig. S7.† The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of BDT-O are −5.22 eV and −3.48 eV, respectively. However, the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of BDT-S are −5.31 eV/−3.55 eV, which are deeper than those of BDT-O. This is because the alkthiophenyl side-chain has a weaker electron-donating ability than alkoxyphenyl. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations with the B3LYP (6-31G(d, p)) basis were used to get the optimized molecular geometry, energy level and electrostatic potential distribution of BDT-S and BDT-O.26–28 In order to reduce the computational time, all the long alkyl side-chains were replaced by methyl groups. Fig. S8† shows the theoretical frontier molecular orbital distribution about the HOMO and LUMO of two small molecule donors, which are in good agreement with the values obtained from the electrochemical method. Moreover, the electrostatic potential distribution (ESP) of BDT-S and BDT-O is shown in Fig. S9,† implying that BDT-S displayed small ESP in the BDT side chain.

The UV-visible absorption spectra of small molecule donors BDT-S and BDT-O and the non-fullerene acceptor Y6-BO in chloroform solution and solid film are exhibited in Fig. S10†, and their detailed data are shown in Table 1. It could be seen that the solution absorption of the two molecules is in the range of 400–650 nm, and the absorption lines of the two molecules are almost overlapped, but BDT-S possessed a higher absorbance than BDT-O. Particularly, the maximum absorption peak of BDT-S is 7 nm blue-shifted compared to that of BDT-O in the film, which is in good agreement with the grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) data that the weaker crystallinity of BDT-S can be observed. The film absorption of these two small molecule donors both showed obvious vibration shoulders, indicating that they had strong π–π accumulation.29Fig. 1d shows the absorption of the blend films. The BDT-S:Y6-BO-blend film under TA treatment exhibited a higher absorbance in the range of 500–600 nm that the BDT-O:Y6-BO-blend film after TA treatment, which is consistent with their pure films. After adding 0.25% of DIO, the absorbance in the range of 520–620 nm of the two blend films was obviously enhanced, and a shoulder at 620 nm can be observed, especially for the BDT-S:Y6-BO-blend film. It is indicated that the stacking/aggregation of the small molecule donors can be clearly enhanced when using 0.25% of DIO as a solvent additive. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra demonstrated the emission peak of BDT-S, BDT-O and their blend film with Y6-BO which is excited at 560 nm, shown in Fig. 1e. Although the emission peak of the neat film of BDT-S exhibited a 9 nm blue shift compared with BDT-O (691 nm vs. 700 nm), the intensity of BDT-S was significantly higher than that of BDT-O, which showed a similar trend to film absorption of two small molecule donors. Moreover, nearly no obvious PL peaks can be observed in their blend films, suggesting a better charge transfer between the donor and acceptor, with or without the DIO solvent additive.
Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) are usually used to investigate the decomposition temperature (Td) of a material and the aggregation and crystallization of a material at high temperature, respectively. Fig. S11† illustrates that the temperatures of 5% weight loss of BDT-S and BDT-O were 356 °C and 363 °C, implying that both of them possessed an excellent thermal stability. Fig. S12† shows the DSC curves of two small molecule donors under heating and cooling conditions, showing that both of them had an endothermic melting peak and an exothermic crystallization transition peak.30 Due to the electron withdrawing ability difference between S and O, the cooling crystallization peaks of BDT-S and BDT-O are dissimilar. In the cooling process, BDT-S and BDT-O show exothermic crystallization transition peaks at 222 °C and 253 °C, but BDT-O showed a much sharper peak, demonstrating that BDT-O possesses a higher crystallinity and self-aggregation effect.31
To further explore the effect of the heteroatom side-chains on photovoltaic properties, an ASM-OSC device was fabricated using the conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BDT-S:Y6-BO or BDT-O:Y6-BO/PDINO/Al, shown in Fig. 1a. Fig. 2a and Table 2 display the current density–voltage (J–V) and the detailed photovoltaic parameters of the devices measured under 1-sun (AM1.5 G) simulated solar illumination. We used two different post-treatment methods for the active layers based on BDT-S:Y6-BO and BDT-O:Y6-BO. Using the approach of adding the DIO additive followed by TA, the device of BDT-S:Y6-BO showed a high efficiency of 14.3%, together with a VOC of 0.832 V, a JSC of 25.14 mA cm−2 and an FF of 68.3%, while the BDT-O:Y6-BO based device obtained an efficiency of 12.06% with a VOC of 0.817 V, a JSC of 23.07 mA cm−2 and an FF of 64.02%. However, under the conditions of only TA treatment at 100 °C/10 min for blend films, the PCEs of the two devices obviously decreased. The BDT-S:Y6-BO-based device showed an efficiency of 8.38% with a VOC of 0.861 V, a JSC of 21.16 mA cm−2 and an FF of 46.01%, but the device of BDT-O:Y6-BO yielded a relatively poor efficiency of only 6.56% with a VOC of 0.843 V, a JSC of 17.84 mA cm−2 and an FF of 43.56%. The higher VOC is observed in the BDT-S:Y6-BO-based device, which is attributed to the deeper HOMO of BDT-S than that of BDT-O. The improved JSC and FF of the BDT-S:Y6-BO-based device will be explained in the following discussion. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra and their integrated current curves are exhibited in Fig. 2b. From the EQE measurement, the photo-response of the four devices behaved the same in the range from 300 to 1000 nm, and the calculated JSC values are within a 4% deviation. The calculated JSC values from the EQE tests are 24.47 and 22.29 mA cm−2 for OSCs based on BDT-S:Y6-BO and BDT-O:Y6-BO with the DIO additive, respectively. The devices of BDT-S:Y6-BO and BDT-O:Y6-BO after TA treatment obtain the calculated JSC values of 20.83 and 17.61 mA cm−2, severally. Among the four devices, using the DIO additive, the photo-response was slightly reduced from 300 to 400 nm but highly enhanced ranging between 400 and 850 nm. In addition, the JSC increased impressively after adding DIO, and this phenomenon was attributed to the improved charge separation and transfer of the optimized device as a result of the proper crystallinity and phase morphology.

The space charge limited current (SCLC) is a conventional measurement to obtain the electron mobility (μe) and hole mobility (μh) to explore and compare the charge transport properties of the different heteroatom side-chains. Fig. S13 and Table S1† display the J1/2–V graphs and related results. The device structures ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor:Y6-BO/MoO3/Al and ITO/Al/donor:Y6-BO/PDINO/Al were used to measure μh and μe. The BDT-S:Y6-BO based device exhibited the best performance, showed an μe of 6.13 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, a μh of 4.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the best balanced charge carrier mobility μe/μh of 1.33 with the DIO additive applied. When only using TA treatment, the mobilities were calculated to 5.05 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.42 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the BDT-S:Y6-BO blend. Meanwhile, a similar tendency was seen in the BDT-O:Y6-BO based device, as shown in Table S1.† Therefore, the BDT-S:Y6-BO blend film possessed a higher mobility and more balanced μe/μh than that of the BDT-O:Y6-BO blend film, resulting in a higher JSC and FF in the devices.
The relationship between photogenerated current density (Jph) and effective voltage (Veff) can reflect the mechanism of exciton dissociation and charge collection. When Veff is at a high value, the carriers move toward the electrode, and Jph tends to saturate.32 In this work, the saturated photocurrent (Jsat) was defined as Jph at a Veff in 3 V. Fig. 2c shows the curves of Jph–Veff, and Table S1† provides the results of exciton dissociation probabilities (ηdiss) and charge collection efficiencies (ηcoll). The device based on BDT-S:Y6-BO with the use of DIO exhibited the highest ηdiss of 95% and ηcoll of 85%, which is correlated with the highest JSC. However, the device based on BDT-O:Y6-BO, with the DIO additive, showed a slight difference in ηdiss (93%) and an obvious reduction in ηcoll (79%), implying that alkoxy-substituted BDT-O will reduce the charge collection capability in the device. Compared with the optimized devices using the DIO additive, the Jph of only TA treated devices displayed a slowed speed and needed a high voltage to reach saturation, suggesting inefficient charge generation and extraction, resulting in a decreased JSC.33 In order to investigate the dependence of light intensity (Plight) on JSC and VOC, the correlations of Plight–JSC and Plight–VOC can be used to explain the devices' recombination mechanism by the following equations:34 JSC ∝ Plightα(1) (2)

Fig. 2c–e show two curves of four devices based on BDT-S and BDT-O with two post-treatment methods, and their detailed data are displayed in Table S1.†α is an index factor meaning that bimolecular recombination can less influence free charge extraction when α is close to 1.35 The α values are 0.99, 0.98, 0.96, and 0.93 for the DIO-treated BDT-S:Y6-BO, TA-treated BDT-S:Y6-BO, DIO-treated BDT-O:Y6-BO, and TA-treated BDT-O:Y6-BO-based devices, respectively. It is indicated that bimolecular combination in the BDT-S based device with the DIO additive was suppressed very well. n is defined as an ideal factor which represents the degree of bimolecular recombination, and the value of n, close to 1, means more bimolecular recombination instead of trap-assisted recombination. The n value of the DIO-treated BDT-S:Y6-BO-based device is 1.06, whereas the n of the DIO-treated BDT-O:Y6-BO-based device increased to 1.11, suggesting the more heavy trap-assisted recombination in the BDT-O:Y6-BO-based device. This result should be a reason for the significantly improved JSC and FF in the BDT-S:Y6-BO-based device.
To better investigate the detailed charge transfer dynamic mechanism of ASM-OSC blend films (BDT-S:Y6-BO or BDT-O:Y6-BO), femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fs-TAS), as an efficient approach, was applied to probe the photo-induced hole transfer between the acceptor and donor.36–38 In this work, an 800 nm pump laser light was used to excite the acceptor Y6-BO. Fig. S14c† shows that the excited neat Y6-BO film exhibits a wide range of negative ground state bleach (GSB) in the peak of 827 nm and two stimulated emission (SE) peaks of 520 nm and 747 nm. As displayed in Fig. 3a, BDT-S:Y6-BO-blend films with addition of DIO show a broad GSB from 500–660 nm, elucidating that the efficient hole transfer from the acceptor to the donor happened and then generated the charge transfer (CT) states. Moreover, excited state absorption occurred and a portion of the CT state jumped to a higher energy level reacted by the probe light, resulting in an obvious positive absorption signal at 684 nm. However, the blend film of BDT-O:Y6-BO, applied with DIO, shown in Fig. 3b, demonstrates the GSB signal of the donor in 500–680 nm, and the excited state absorption is too weak. Considering excited state absorption, the blend film of BDT-S:Y6-BO showed a higher CT-state yield than the blend film of BDT-O:Y6-BO, when DIO was added. Furthermore, the same conclusion can be drawn from the blend films of BDT-S:Y6-BO and BDT-O:Y6-BO with TA-treatment, which is shown in Fig. S15.† The relationship between delay time and ΔOD is used to investigate the kinetic process of hole transfer. Because the GSB peaks of the donor and acceptor overlapped in the range of 500–600 nm, the kinetic change at 684 nm was used to verify hole transfer. As shown in Fig. 3c, the generation of a CT state might happen at about 4–10 ps, and the blend film of DIO treated-BDT-S:Y6-BO showed high yield, which was connected to the better exciton dissociation efficiency. The result from fs-TA was consistent with the performance of photogenerated current density.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to evaluate the phase separation morphology and charge transport mechanism of BDT-S:Y6-BO and BDT-O:Y6-BO blend films. Fig. 4a–d show the AFM images of four blend films, with a single atom variation from O to S; the root-mean-square (RMS) of blend films decreased. The root-mean-square RMS of BDT-S:Y6-BO and BDT-O:Y6-BO was 1.06 nm and 1.36 nm when the DIO additive was applied. When using only TA as post-treatment, the RMS of BDT-S:Y6-BO and BDT-O:Y6-BO was 1.44 nm and 1.72 nm. The RMS of DIO treated blend films was smaller than that of the TA treated, indicating that using DIO as a solvent additive can effectively decrease the molecular aggregation between the donor and acceptor. Compared with the BDT-S:Y6-BO blend film (Fig. 4a and c), lots of black dots can be observed in the BDT-O:Y6-BO blend films (Fig. 4b and d) with both TA-and DIO-treatment. From the phase diagrams, we can infer that the black dots represent the concave part of the film, which were the holes. In order to further prove that the black dots were holes in the film, Fig. S16† shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image to view the surface of the film. The surfaces shown in Fig. S16a and c† are smooth, but Fig. S16b and d† show lots of holes on the surface of films, which was consistent with the result of AFM, indicating that the strong crystallinity will affect the film surface due to the strong electronegativity of O. To further investigate the effect on the crystallinity of small molecule donors by DIO, Fig. S17† illustrates the AFM images of BDT-S and BDT-O neat films, showing that there are plenty of holes in the BDT-O films (Fig. S17a†) while the BDT-S film (Fig. S17b†) is smooth, and no holes appear in the film. Thus, it is speculated that the stronger crystallinity and aggregation of BDT-O destroyed the film, which resulted in the poor performance of the device based on BDT-O. In addition, as shown in Fig. S17b–d,† the AFM diagrams of BDT-O neat films indicated that the phases evolved to less black dots and proper morphology after using different treatment processes, revealing that the DIO additive played a significant role in improving film formation. Other than that, whether from AFM or SEM, the holes of BDT-O:Y6-BO decreased upon adding the DIO additive, suggesting that DIO can effectively improve the morphologies of blend films.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out to further reveal the morphology differences between the optimized devices and poor devices. The TEM images are displayed in Fig. 5i–l, showing that all the blend films had bright and dark regions, indicating that the blend films displayed separated phase morphologies.39 It is worth noting that, as illustrated in Fig. 5i and j, adding DIO can enhance the clarity of phase separation and obtain smaller domain sizes, which was conducive to enhancing charge separation and reducing charge combination, resulting in higher a JSC and FF. Notably, for the best performing blend film (BDT-S:Y6-BO with DIO), there were numerous curved lines displayed on the graph, which was consistent with the bright lines shown in the AFM phase diagram, confirming that the film demonstrated a better phase-separation and suitable domain size. For the blend films of BDT-O:Y6-BO, there were few bright-points in Fig. 5k for the DIO added and numerous bright-points in Fig. 5l for that treated with only TA. These bright points represented the thinner part of the films, which was the holes in the film shown in the previous AFM and TEM images, elucidating that adopting the DIO additive can efficiently improve the morphology of blend films and decrease excessive domain aggregation. Due to the suitable crystallinity by the weak electronegativity of S, under the same post-treated approach, the BDT-S devices showed proper phase separation and an aggregation scale compared to BDT-O-based devices, leading to a higher JSC and FF.

GIWAXS is an efficient approach to evaluate the molecular packing, stacking orientation and crystallinity of neat or blend films.40 Fig. S18† exhibits the two-dimensional (2D) GIWAXS patterns of BDT-S, BDT-O and Y6-BO neat films and the 1D scattering pattern in the out of plane (OOP) and in plane (IP) directions. As shown in Fig. S18a and b,† both BDT-S and BDT-O showed strong lamellar stacking peaks in OOP and π–π stacking peaks in IP, and preferred primarily edge-on orientation, while the non-fullerene acceptor Y6-BO displayed a strong face-on orientation. In the IP and OOP directions, BDT-S and BDT-O showed similar scattering peaks and crystal coherence lengths (CCLs). However, BDT-S displayed a less edge-on preference and weaker lamellar stacking peaks at (100), (200), (300) and (400) than those of BDT-O, which was contributed to the difference in crystallinity because of different electron withdrawing abilities between S and O. Moreover, an additional peak at ∼0.50 Å−1 (d = 12.6 Å) with a CCL of 13.7 nm in the IP direction was observed in the BDT-O film, indicating the presence of more ordered lamellar stacking. Therefore, with an atom variation from O to S, the crystallinity of the molecule decreased. Fig. 5 shows the 2D and 1D GIWAXS diffraction patterns of the BDT-S:Y6-BO and BDT-O:Y6-BO blend films of two post-treatment methods. All of the blend films displayed primarily face-on orientations, implying that the molecular orientations of the donors were significantly influenced by blending with the the acceptor. In the OOP direction, the obvious lamellar stacking at the (200), (300) and (400) peaks of the donor disappeared, and the intensity of (100) peak decreased, indicating that blending with a non-fullerene acceptor could reduce the lamellar stacking of the donor. When using the DIO additive, the d-spacing of the BDT-S:Y6-BO and the BDT-O:Y6-BO blend films, and the corresponding CCLs are displayed in Table S2.† Both of the two blend films showed similar scattering peaks, indicating that the distances of π–π and lamellar stacking are very close. However, in the OOP direction, a sharper lamellar stacking peak at 0.30 Å−1 (d = 20.9 Å) with a CCL of 9.7 nm can be observed in the BDT-O:Y6-BO blend film with DIO-treatment. Consequently, the BDT-S:Y6-BO blend film preferred a more highly ordered face-on stacking and provided more efficient charge transfer channels, allowing an impressive JSC increase to 25.14 mA cm−2.
Conclusions
In summary, two new small molecule donors with alkoxyphenyl- and alkthiophenyl-substituted benzodithiophene (BDT) as the central building units named BDT-O and BDT-S were successfully synthesized and employed as donors in ASM-OSCs. BDT-S possessed a broader absorption, lower energy levels, and a more suitable crystallinity than those of alkoxy-substituted BDT-O, due to the difference of electron withdrawing ability between S and O. Consequently, when using DIO as an additive, the BDT-S:Y6-BO-based ASM-OSCs exhibited a high PCE of 14.30% with a notable JSC of 25.14 mA cm−2 and a FF of 68.30%, whereas the BDT-O:Y6-BO-based devices showed a PCE of 12.06% with a JSC of 23.07 mA cm−2 and a FF of 64.02%, which is attributed to a more face-on preferred orientation, a better nano-scaled interpenetrating network phase separation in combination with high and balanced charge transport properties. Moreover, the BDT-S:Y6-BO-blend film possessed a higher CT state generation yield and more efficient exciton dissociation than those of the BDT-O:Y6-BO-blend film, leading to a higher JSC and FF in the device. The results show that side-chain engineering has a direct effect on the efficiency of OSC devices. More importantly, heteroatom side-chain engineering can be an efficient method to further enhance the PCE of OSCs.
