The theoretical approach not only promotes a deeper understanding of the connection between the external electric field, chemical structure and optical and electronic properties of the donor⋯acceptor system, but also can be developed for the rational design of a novel conjugated system for organic solar cells.
1. Introduction
Since the discovery of a p–n junction Si photovoltaic (PV) device reported in 1954,1 the science and technology of solar cells have undergone revolutionary developments. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of Si solar cells has almost reached 29%, which is certainly a very promising result towards solving the world energy problem.2 However, high production costs still slow down the rate of installations.
Recently, organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices have become very attractive, due to their numerous potential advantages over traditional silicon-based solar cells.3,4 Generally, they are fabricated by sandwiching an organic layer between two electrodes with different work functions, typically ITO and aluminum.5 The current active layers in organic solar cells typically consist of two material components, which are assembled either into multilayered structures or in the form of blends.6,7 The components are two polymers or two different molecules, and the fundamental polymer bulk heterojunction (BHJ) concept involves a combination of a polymer with a molecule. For instance, the blends of a conjugated polymer as the donor (D) with fullerene and its derivatives as the acceptor (A) are the most used D–A materials in one major new application area: “plastic solar cells”.8–10 This kind of BHJ solar cells offers promise for the realization of a low-cost, printable, portable and flexible renewable energy source.10–12 The development of polymer–fullerene plastic solar cells has made significant progress in recent years.13–17 For example the reported OPV devices based on blends of functionalized poly(alkylthiophenes) and poly(phenylene vinylenes) with fullerene provide PCE over 7%.18–20 The PCE is dramatically affected by molecular morphology.21
The key process in the OPV devices is the dissociation of the photogenerated excitons into separated charges, while the reverse process (charge recombination) must be limited. The exciton dissociation and charge recombination both correspond to the charge-transfer reaction and their rates can be estimated using the weak coupling limit of Marcus theory and extensions thereof.22 The theory is valid, based on the assumption that the system has to reach the transition state for the transfer to occur, though it neglects tunneling effects that can assist the transfer, especially at low temperatures.7 According to the Marcus theory, the electron transfer rate can be calculated as:23 (1)where λ is the reorganization energy, Vda is the electronic coupling matrix element between the donor and the acceptor, and ΔG is the free energy change for the electron transfer reaction. When taking ΔG as negative, the square dependence in (ΔG + λ) of the exponential term implies that the transfer rate displays a peak profile as a function of λ (which has positive value) and reaches a maximum when |ΔG| is equal to λ. The reorganization energy and the free energy change, however, are expected to be different for forward and backward reactions. We assign λ = λCT and λCR, ΔG = ΔGCT and ΔGCR for the exciton dissociation or charge recombination, respectively.
Poly[N-9′′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT):[6,6]-phenyl C70-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) BHJ solar cell material, here selected as the model system, presents a PCE beyond 6%, and internal quantum efficiencies (IQEs) approaching 100%.14 The electronic states of polyfluorene copolymers with alternating donor–acceptor units and time evolution of the primary excitations have been investigated by femtosecond fluorescence up-conversion spectroscopy.8 In addition, from the viewpoint of the electronic structure and efficient BHJ composites, the D⋯A system should have strong electronic coupling whereas the exciton binding energy should be low. We point out that, in such solar cells, the charge separation and further transport occur under the influence of the electric field generated via the difference in the work-functions of the electrodes. All the parameters in eqn (1), which influence the rate of electron transfer in such D⋯A systems can, in principle, depend on the electric field.24 The details of those dependencies are the main topic of the current work.
2. Theoretical methods
All quantum chemical calculations were done with Gaussian 09 software.25 The ground-state equilibrium geometries of the PCDTBT:PC70BM BHJ material, isolated PC70BM and PCDTBT were optimized using density functional theory (DFT)26 with a B3LYP functional27,28 and a 6-31G(D) basis set. To study the reorganization energy and Gibbs free energy of charge transfer reaction in Marcus theory, the positively charged equilibrium geometry of isolated PCDTBT and a negatively charged equilibrium geometry of isolated PC70BM were also optimized with DFT, a B3LYP functional, and a 6-31G(D) basis set, and then the energy of the neutral/charged PC70BM, based on the optimized negative-charged/neutral equilibrium geometry was obtained from single point energy calculations at the same level of theory. The electronic transitions of PCDTBT:PC70BM and the geometry optimization of the lowest excited state of the isolated donor and the radical cation state were performed with time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT),29 long-range-corrected functional (CAM-B3LYP)30 and the 6-31G(D) basis set, respectively. To investigate the effect of the external electric field on the properties of the excited-state of the molecules, the finite field method was employed, and the direction of the electric field is from PCDTBT to PC70BM. The electric fields, ranging from −20 × 10−5 to 20 × 10−5 au, were used. This can be compared to the realistic strength of the electric field in the solar cell devices of up to 4 × 10−5 au (∼2 × 107 V m−1).24 The field in a solar cell can be oriented in all possible directions with respect to the polymer–fullerene interface. The two-dimensional real space representation (2D site transition density matrix) and three-dimensional real space representation (3D cube charge difference density) were described in our previous article.31,32 The hole–electron distance (Δr) of the CT state was calculated using Multiwfn Software.33
3. Results and discussion
A. External electric field and the ground state properties
One route to enhance the device performance is by understanding the device physics and then optimizing the device parameters.34 A detailed analysis of the state-of-the art BHJ solar cells reveals that the efficiency is limited by the low open-circuit voltage (Voc) delivered by these devices under illumination.35 In 2001, Brabec et al. demonstrated that Voc almost linearly correlates with the D–A effective energy-gap for solar cells based on the blends of polyphenylenevinylene and different fullerene derivatives. Note that these observations were discussed within the concept of Fermi level pinning between fullerenes and metals via surface charges.34 In 2005, Koster et al. derived a description of Voc from the quasi-Fermi level difference, neglecting injection barriers. And they concluded that Voc depends on the effective energy-gap, the temperature and the carrier concentration.36 Furthermore, Vandewal et al. found that the energy of the charge transfer state is directly proportional to the experimental Voc, and presented the origin of the dependence of Voc on the effective energy-gap of the solar cells, i.e. the energy-gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of the donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of the accepter again.37 Though, Voc has been proved to be adjusted by the material and environmental parameters such as semiconductor energy levels, work functions of the electrodes, light intensity, solar cell and light-source temperatures, charge-carrier recombination, and external fluorescence efficiency,38 lots of theoretical and experimental research studies fully support the view that the energy-gap between the acceptor LUMO and the donor HOMO gives the dominant contribution to Voc for polymer BHJ OPVs. The simple and effective expression for estimating Voc could be described as: Voc = 1/e(|EH(D) − EL(A)|) − 0.3 V,39 here e is the elementary charge, EH(D) is the HOMO energy level of the donor, EL(A) is the LUMO energy level of the acceptor, and 0.3 V is an empirical factor for efficient charge separation. Subsequently, this empirical equation has been widely utilized by experimentalists and theoreticians to predict Voc of new active materials for bulk-heterojunction solar cells, although many factors such as light intensity, external fluorescence efficiency, and charge carrier concentrations are neglected.17,40–42 So models successfully describing the situation in pristine conjugated polymer photodiodes can explain the observed Voc in conjugated polymer–fullerene based (BHJ) solar cells, to some extent.43 As is known, for the polymer–fullerene bulk heterojunctions, two energy level differences governing the Voc are indicated: (1) the effective energy-gap corresponding to the energy of the polaron pair after exciton dissociation and thus depending on donor and acceptor energetics, and (2) the difference of the work functions of the anode and cathode.44 In addition, the energies of the molecular orbital for the donor and the acceptor are also considered to be influenced by the strength of the external electric field (Fext). Following the classical Voc of the thin-film solar-cell concept, the qualitative discussion on the relationship between the HOMO–LUMO energy gap of the whole conjugated BHJ materials and the finite external electric field, associated with those of the donor and acceptor units, will give some reasonable fundamental physics for improving the device performances and for further making a rational design of optimized BHJ solar cells.
In Fig. 1a, the MO energy levels of the PCDTBT:PC70BM blend are plotted versus the different strengths of the external electric field, added on the photo-active layer of the PCDTBT:PC70BM BHJ solar cell material. While considering the solar emission spectrum and the ideal open circuit potential of the resulting solar cell (1.2–1.9 eV), an appropriate HOMO–LUMO energy gap of the PCDTBT:PC70BM BHJ material has been obtained. This agrees well with this typical organic semiconductors applied as photoactive materials, which have an optimal bandgap of about 2 eV.45 Most importantly, a linear decrease of the HOMO–LUMO energy gap with the increase of the external electric field strength can be observed, which is related to the change of optimal absorption influenced by Fext. As can be seen from Fig. 1b, when the external electric field is positive and negative, with the increase of |Fext| the absorption spectrum (i.e. the calculated excitation energy) red-shifts and blue-shifts, respectively. As will be discussed in the next section, the red-shift of the absorption spectrum of the charge transfer excited-state will accelerate the rate of charge-transfer reaction. This partly originates from the increase of Gibbs free energy and the decrease of reorganization energy for the charge-transfer reaction of the D⋯A system, which is induced by the external electric field (see Table S1 in ESI†).
 Fig. 1  The HOMO and LUMO energy levels (a), excitation energy of the lowest ICT state (b), and the energy gap of (LUMO+3)–HOMO and LUMO–(HOMO−1) energy levels (c) of the PCDTBT:PC70BM blend plotted versus the external electric field. 
It is interesting to note that in relation to Fig. S1a (ESI†), the HOMO energy levels of the isolated polymer PCDTBT is about 4.93 eV, which can easily contact PEDOT:PSS with a Fermi level of −5.0 eV, when PEDOT:PSS is applied as the anode material.46 By comparing Fig. S1a and b (ESI†), the LUMO energy level of the isolated polymer PCDTBT is positioned above that of the isolated acceptor (i.e. PC70BM) by ∼0.47 eV, which ensures efficient electron transfer from the polymer to the acceptor.46 This relatively low value assures a relatively high open circuit potential in the final device.45 Moreover, the fact suggests that the calculated HOMO and LUMO energy values of the isolated polymer PCDTBT increase negligibly with the external electric field strength. This is consistent with the results shown in Fig. 1c, in which the energy gap between LUMO+3 and HOMO remains almost unchanged (∼2.335 eV) under the influence of Fext and further indicates that the excitation energy of the donor part of PCDTBT:PC70BM is independent of the external electric field. The selection of the special orbits here is mainly originated from the fact that the electron and hole densities of HOMO and LUMO+3 are both populated in the PCDTBT (donor) group, as can be clearly seen from Fig. S2 (ESI†). In contrast, the isolated acceptor PC70BM behaves differently. A relative large increase of the LUMO energy with the increase of the external electric field strength can be found (see Fig. S1b, ESI†). Similarly, the electron and hole densities of HOMO − 1 and LUMO are both populated in the PC70BM (acceptor) group (see Fig. S2, ESI†). This demonstrates that the external electric field mainly adjusts the energy level of the acceptor part of PCDTBT:PC70BM BHJ material (see Fig. 1c).
It should be emphasized that the effects of Fext on the HOMO and LUMO energies of the isolated PCDTBT and PC70BM are different from those of the PCDTBT:PC70BM blend, as can be seen from Fig. 1a and Fig. S1 (ESI†). The result can be explained as follows: in the molecular orbit (MO) picture, the wave-function morphology has to be modified due to the interaction between PC70BM and PCDTBT monomers. The strong influence of the external electric field on the HOMO–LUMO energy gaps of the active layer can be observed by introducing the concept of Fermi-level pinning.34 Based on the above findings, the limiting efficiency of bulk-heterojunction solar cells can be predicted as a function of the Fext dependent band gap to some extent. However, the solar cell performance is not solely driven by the energy levels of the materials.45 Clearly, the charge transfer rate of the photo-active layer material, PCDTBT:PC70BM, of BHJ solar cells is another important parameter for improving the efficiency of the solar cells.
B. External electric field and the excited-state properties
Firstly, the electron–hole coherence (2D contour plot) of three kinds of electronic transitions can be seen in Fig. 2, and the charge transfer is visualized by charge difference densities (CDD)47 presented in Fig. 3. All the calculated excited states were carefully examined with these two representations, and classified as the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) or the local excited (LE) transitions. From the 2D contour plots of transition density matrix for ICT transitions, we can see the electron–hole coherence between PCDTBT and PC70BM of this kind of BHJ materials. Furthermore, from CDD, we can clearly identify electron transfer from PCDTBT to PC70BM. 2D site and 3D cube representations also reveal the localized excited states LE(PC70BM) for S1/S2 and LE(PCDTBT) for S3, where electrons and holes are both residing on PC70BM and PCDTBT, respectively. The S9–S12 states are the lowest excited-states with the property of ICT transitions under different strengths of the external electric field, respectively. And, the Fext effect on the electronic character of S0 → S9–S12 transition is found to be very pronounced. In detail, the ICT character becomes more and more obvious for the S9 state with the increase of the strength of the external electric field. When Fext is positive and large enough, the S9 state can be classified as an ICT state. While, the other excited states behave oppositely. The S12 state, for example, starts mainly as a transition with a considerable ICT character, which diminishes while the field increases. So it is evident that the external electric field can regulate the ICT excited-state dynamics of the PCDTBT:PC70BM BHJ material.
 Fig. 2  The 2D contour plots of the selected transition density matrix of the PCDTBT:PC70BM blend with different excited-state properties. The colour bar is shown (absolute values of matrix elements, scaled to a maximum value of 1.0), and the electron–hole coherence increases with the increase of absolute values of matrix elements. 
 Fig. 3  Selected charge difference densities (CDD) of the PCDTBT:PC70BM blend in different external electric fields. (Fext in 10−5 au) Green and red color represents holes and electrons, respectively. 
Note that, Fig. 3 is the qualitative visualization analysis with 3D charge difference density for charge transfer. To provide a better quantitative analysis of the charge transfer property, Δr is introduced to measure the charge-transfer length:33 (2)where i and j run over all occupied and virtual molecular orbitals, respectively. φ is the orbital wavefunction. The larger Δr, the stronger charge transfer character. According to Fig. 3, we are interested in the external electric field dependent S9–S12. The length of charge transfer can be seen from Fig. 4 for these excited states. It is found that the excited state properties of charge transfer are strongly dependent on the external electric fields, which supported the results of CDD in Fig. 3. For example, both S11 and S12 represent the charge transfer properties at Fext = −5 × 10−5 au, and S11 and S12 exchange excited state properties of charge transfer and local excitations. At Fext = −7 × 10−5 and 10 × 10−5 au, there are similar excited properties.
 Fig. 4  Charge transfer length of different excited states in different external electric fields. 
In order to investigate the effects of the external electric field on the transition energy, the transition dipole moment and other excited-state properties of the PCDTBT:PC70BM BHJ material, the external electric field dependent excited-state characteristics were calculated by using the TD-DFT method. The most relevant results for the evaluation of electron transfer with the external electric field are summarized in Table 1. For all the selected excited-states the transition energies are sensitive to the Fext, and the effect of Fext on ICT transition is quite pronounced (see the boldface and italic fonts in Table 1). As can be seen from Table 1 and Fig. 3, the electronic character of the transitions (for S9, S10, S11 and S14) are sensitive to the external field Fext. The character of these transition changes between LE(PC70BM) ↔ ICT when the external electric field is increasing. In detail, when the Fext is in the range of −20 × 10−5 to −5 × 10−5 au, the S12 state shows ICT character, and the ICT character becomes more and more obvious for the S11 state at Fext = −3 × 10−5–5 × 10−5 au. When Fext is large enough (>5 × 10−5 au), the S10 and S9 states can be classified as ICT states.

In addition, the PCDTBT:PC70BM BHJ material, considered in this work, exhibits mainly an increase in the permanent dipole moment upon excitation. Such dependence is demonstrated by calculating the excitation energy at zero field and at different field strengths ranging from −20 × 10−5 to 20 × 10−5 au. The fit resulted in a dipole moment change of Δμ ∼ 11.5 Debye for the first intermolecular charge transfer excited state, for which we only study the first order nonlinear effect.
C. Charge generation and recombination rates

a. Gibbs free energy of reaction. 
The free energy gap law of the electron transfer rate can be systematically investigated by applying electric fields, when the modulation of the free energy change by the external electric field is known.48 Following the electron transfer, an additional dipole moment is generated by the separated charges. If the polarization produced in the system is uniform, the external electric field interacts with the electric dipole moment of the radical pair. As a consequence, the reaction free energy of a radical pair with the total dipole moment μ in the charge separated state of D+A− is perturbed by an external electric field and obtains an additional component. When the change in the free energy caused by this field-dipole interaction is considered, an additional expression for evaluating the field dependent free energy gap for the charge transfer reaction can be obtained as:49 ΔG(Fext) − ΔG(0) = −ΔμFext(3)while, when the static dielectric constants of the solutes are different from that of the solvent, polarization charge is created on the surface of the solutes under the influence of the external electric field. The electrostatic potential of the polarization charge on the surface vanishes at the center of the same solute under a uniform external electric field. However, the interaction between the charge of the solute and the polarization charge on the surface of another solute produced by the electric field creates an additional free energy change under the influence of the electric field. In this case, a simple formula to estimate the free energy change under the influence of the external electric field in polar solvents should be described as:48 ΔG(Fext) − ΔG(0) = −efFextR(4)where f is in the lowest order approximation given by: (5) All parameters have been defined in literature.48 The approximation works better when the ratio of the two radii is different. Thereby the influence of the external electric field on ΔG can be estimated by two different methods by using eqn (3) and (4), respectively. When the relative permittivity εs = 1, eqn (4) reduces to eqn (3). According to our previous study, eqn (3) can provide a reliable method to evaluate the external electric field dependent free energy.24 For simple discussion, only eqn (3) is considered in this paper. It should be noted that we have considered only the charge separation reaction. The extension to other types of electron transfer reactions, such as charge recombination and charge shift reactions, is straightforward and the results are the same as that of the charge separation reaction given in this paper.
The free energy for the exciton dissociation ΔGCT(0) and charge recombination ΔGCR(0) can be evaluated in different ways.49–52 The meaning of the parameter can be well understood in terms of potential energy curves, as shown by Fig. 1 in ref. 24. Then ΔG(0) is the energy difference of the constituents in their final and initial states, including the Columbic attraction energy (ΔEcoul) between the two charges in the charge-separated state. Thus, for exciton dissociation, ΔGCT(0) can be evaluated by eqn (S1) in the ESI.†7 Similarly, the ΔGCR(0) has been estimated from expressions in eqn (S2) (ESI†), but involving the charge-separated state and the ground state. The exciton binding energy Eb mainly originates from the Coulombic attraction energy between the electron and hole and is usually taken as the difference between the electronic and optical band gap energy.53
The external electric field dependent free energy for exciton dissociation and charge recombination are reported in Fig. 5, and data are collected in Table S1 (ESI†). As can be seen, ΔGCT(Fext) for exciton dissociation upon donor photoexcitation becomes increasingly negative when the external electric field is increased (going from −0.62 eV at Fext = −20 × 10−5 to −0.75 eV at Fext = 20 × 10−5 au). And the decline reflects the size of the electrostatic interaction between the separated charges and the electric field. At the same time, as expected, ΔGCR(Fext) for charge recombination becomes less negative following the increase of the electric field. The sum of ΔGCT(Fext) and ΔGCR(Fext) is related to the energy of PCDTBT*:PC70BM at its corresponding strength of the electric field, which is insensitive to the external electric filed according to our calculated results (−2.6989 eV and −2.7317 eV at Fext = 20 × 10−5 and −20 × 10−5 au, respectively, as shown in Fig. S3, ESI†). This is consistent with the above theoretical discussion on the electric field dependent energy level of PCDTBT. In addition, we have concluded that, ΔμCT (the change in the permanent dipole moment upon electronic transition) is a key parameter for determining the effect of Fext on the free energy gap.24 Here, a similar conclusion of Fext leading to orientation-dependent photoinduced charge-separation kinetics of the PCDTBT:PC70BM blend can be obtained in relation to eqn (3). That is, the external electric field can decrease the charge transfer efficiency in a randomly oriented system, whereas the oriented charge-separation along the direction of Fext is enhanced.

b. Reorganization energy. 
According to the previous studies,24 the values of the inner reorganization energy λi of the D–A molecule (fullerene-linked quarter-thiophene dyad) are insensitive to the external electric field. In detail, a decrease of less than 0.01 eV can be found for both exciton dissociation and charge recombination, respectively, following the increase of Fext at a large range of −5 to 20 × 10−5 au. The λiCT(Fext) and λiCR(Fext), at all the strengths of the selected Fext, are found to be mainly determined by the geometric distortions of quarter-thiophene. This is attributed to the structural rigidity of the fullerene molecule. Based on the above analysis, we have evaluated all the parameters used to determine the λi (see eqn (S4)–(S6) in ESI†) at the DFT/TDDFT level, at Fext = −20–20 × 10−5 au. According to our calculated results, shown in Fig. 6a, a similar conclusion can be obtained. That is, the inner reorganization energy λi of the D⋯A type molecule (PCDTBT:PC70BM BHJ solar cell material considered here) is also insensitive to the external electric field. This mainly originates from the fact that the equilibrium geometry of the donor and acceptor sites of PCDTBT:PC70BM remains almost unchanged upon electron transfer at an arbitrary strength of Fext (see Fig. 3).
 Fig. 6  Inner reorganization energy plotted versus the external electric field (a), outer reorganization energy plotted versus the external electric field (b). 
For exciton dissociation to separate charges, we start from the initially excited PCDTBT. The reorganization energy has contributions from both the electron donor and the acceptor. The excited PCDTBT has to relax to its corresponding radical cation state following electron transfer reaction. The corresponding values for fullerene are needed from the ground-state geometry to the radical anion geometry. The sum of these contributions adds up to λi2. And λi1 corresponds to the backward process. If the reactant and product have identical symmetric potentials these two reorganization energies are equal. In general they are not equal and commonly their average is used to calculate the reorganization energy.7 Thereby we obtain λiCT = 0.371 eV at Fext = 0. In the case of charge recombination, we count the energy required to promote PCDTBT from the geometry characteristic of the radical cation state to the ground-state geometry. The PC70BM contribution is the same as for exciton dissociation. As a result we obtain λiCR = 0.233 eV at Fext = 0.
The outer reorganization energy λs is related to the change in electronic and nuclear polarizations that arises as a result of the whole (heterojunction and solvent molecule) geometric relaxation in the charge transfer process, which can be expressed in the framework of the dielectric continuum model as below and all parameters are well defined therein:7 (6) As is known, it is generally difficult to obtain a reliable quantitative theoretical estimation of λs. QM/MM54 or polarizable force field55 methods have been performed for the direct evaluation of λs in the condensed phase. The classical dielectric continuum models have to be resorted to.7 This will result in the substantial uncertainty of λs caused by the different experimental conditions.52 For simple discussion, the lowest order approximation of the Marcus reorganization energy expression can be used: (7)and the conclusion “except for an extreme condition, the Marcus expression for the reorganization energy provides a sufficiently good approximation to the exact numerical results” can be obtained.48 Noted that, within the framework of the linear response theory, the expression for the reorganization energy is not influenced by the external electric field.48
Since the PC70BM have a spherical shape and the charges in the charge-separated states are located at the center of it (see Fig. 3), we expect that the Marcus expression for the reorganization energy works well, though the Marcus expression is an approximate one derived on the assumption that the system is uniformly polarized despite the presence of the solutes. Moreover, the outer contribution to the reorganization energy is of the same order of magnitude as the inner part, and it is expected to be less sensitive to the chemical structure of the constituents in most cases.4 Several authors leave λs as an adjustable parameter or use an order of magnitude estimate.56 And in large systems like the porphyrin–fullerene dyad, the outer reorganization energy of electron transfer reaction is calculated to be ∼0.25 eV.57–59 Based on these results we choose λs to be equal to the inner reorganization energy λi at Fext = 0. In addition, by comparing eqn (6) and (7), the outer electric field effects on λs can be attributed to only one term, that is the Columbic attractive interaction between the charge on one solute and the induced dipole due to the charge distribution produced on the solvent surface around the other solute. Consequently, the Coulombic attractive interaction is expected to be strongly influenced by the external electric field. So, for the D⋯A type BHJ materials, eqn (7) is not a very reliable way to estimate the outer reorganization energy when considering an external electric field. In conclusion, a reasonable simplified estimation for the external electric field dependent outer reorganization can be done using: λs(Fext) − λs(0) = −ΔμFext(8) The influence of Fext on the total reorganization energies λCT(Fext) and λCR(Fext) calculated in this way is expected to modify mainly the outer part of the reorganization energy λs. When the Coulombic attractive interaction is taken into account, the outer reorganization energy for BHJ materials can be evaluated, based on the DFT/TDDFT calculated results. The dependence of the outer reorganization energy, as a function of the external electric field is calculated and shown in Fig. 6b. The values of the outer reorganization energy of the PCDTBT:PC70BM blend are found to decrease from 0.434 eV to 0.309 eV and from 0.296 to 0.171 eV for the exciton dissociation and charge recombination, respectively, following the increase of Fext at the range of −20–20 × 10−5 au.


c. Electronic coupling. 
For a given pair of diabatic states corresponding to the donor and the acceptor, the external electric field dependent electronic coupling matrix element can be expressed using the external electric field dependent model Vda(Fext) = γVda(0),24 which can be clearly understood from eqn (S7)–(S9), and, γ provides a convenient diagnostic indicator of the influence of the external electric field on the electronic coupling matrix element Vda. In order to investigate the influence of Fext on the electronic coupling matrix element Vda, we present the calculated |γ| values of the selected excited states of the PCDTBT:PC70BM blend using TD-DFT data in different external electric fields. Note that the polymer bulk heterojunction is structurally disordered without any preferred orientation of the field with respect to the junction. Therefore we carry out the calculations for both positive and negative values of the field. As can be seen from Fig. 7, the changes in Vda with the field (visualized via γ) for LE(PC70BM) and LE(PCDTBT) are rather small. At the same time for the ICT state the coupling strength between the donor and the acceptor increases substantially following an increase in the strength of Fext. The values of γ < 1 are found when the electric field is in the opposite direction to the current. Clearly, the vector properties of Fext should be considered when the effect of the external electric field is taken into account.

d. Rates of exciton dissociation and charge recombination. 
We are now in a position to evaluate the external electric field dependent rates of exciton dissociation and charge recombination on the basis of the Marcus picture of electron transfer. The rates for the lowest ICT excited states of the PCDTBT:PC70BM blend can be obtained by plugging all the Fext dependent parameters estimated in the above sections into eqn (1). As seen from Fig. 8, the rate of exciton dissociation in this excited-state increases by a factor of ∼5 while varying the electric field from Fext = −20 × 10−5 to 20 × 10−5 au. A detailed analysis reveals that the exciton dissociation rate gets faster when the external electric field is increased mainly because of the increase in electronic coupling, since the differences between ΔGCT and λCT increase with the external electric field. Moreover, the exciton dissociation of the PCDTBT:PC70BM blend is thermodynamically favored and the driving force is sufficiently strong to overcome the Columbic attraction between the charges even at Fext = 0. As a result, the photogenerated charges can easily escape from their mutual attraction and yield free extractable charges. This is in accord with the recent studies, which has proposed that long-range exciton dissociation can occur even before the excitons reach the donor–acceptor interface of the organic solar cell, and the enhanced probability of charge separation from highly delocalized hot interfacial charge transfer states.60,61
 Fig. 8  Calculated rate of exciton dissociation and charge recombination of the lowest ICT state of the PCDTBT:PC70BM blend at different external electric fields. 
It is clear that the weak interaction condition between donor and acceptor molecules is satisfied for the PCDTBT:PC70BM blend. Which, furthermore, correspond to the valid Marcus theory by considering the calculated charge separation rates (∼1011 s−1). It is also worth mentioning that all calculated parameters (electronic couplings, reorganization energies, free energy of the reaction) remain unaffected by the memory effects of the interaction with the environment for simple discussion. Only the qualitative trends of the calculated rates, presented here, will be expected.
Furthermore, as can be seen from Fig. 8, we found that the rate of charge recombination is smaller than the corresponding rate of charge separation. The relative slowness of the recombination process originates from the vanishingly small electronic couplings and from the fact that recombination occurs deep in the inverted Marcus region (|ΔGCR| = 2.029 eV ≫ λCR = 0.467 eV, at Fext = 0). In addition, the recombination reactions appear to have high activation barriers; therefore, only small variations of λs are needed to account for the observed differences in the recombination rates (see Fig. 8). It should point out that, with the formation of the charge-separated state (D+A−), the Coulombic attraction pulls the charges back together to undergo first order geminate recombination. In order to incorporate the external electric field dependence of the recombination kinetics, the second order nongeminate recombination process should be considered.62,63 For the typical realistic electric field values (Fext = 3 × 10−5 au) for the BHJ solar cell devices, the calculated charge recombination rate is quite small. This result is in good agreement with recent studies using time resolved electric field induced second harmonic generation.64

4. Conclusions
In summary, the exciton dissociation and charge recombination dynamics, controlled by the external electric field, in BHJ solar cell materials were investigated in depth by DFT and TD-DFT methods. The exciton dissociation in the lowest ICT excited states of the PCDTBT:PC70BM blend (∼1011 s−1) is found to be thermodynamically favored and its rates increase by a factor of ∼5 when varying the electric field from Fext = −20 × 10−5 to 20 × 10−5 au. The calculated charge recombination rate is smaller than the corresponding rate of charge separation. The large ratio of kCT/kCR for PCDTBT:PC70BM heterojunction promotes the effective exciton dissociation into the fully separated positive and negative charges effectively and will further improve the power conversion efficiency. We thoroughly analyzed the external field dependent charge transfer integral (Vda), reorganization energy (λ) and free energy (ΔG). It is found that the relative slowness of the recombination process originates from the vanishingly small electronic couplings and from the fact that recombination occurs deep in the inverted Marcus region when Fext increases, here only small variations in λs are needed to account for the observed differences in the recombination rates. Moreover, our calculated results of the HOMO–LUMO energy gap of the PCDTBT:PC70BM blend agree well with this typical organic semiconductors applied as photoactive materials. The relationship between the energy gap and the finite external electric field is consistent with the change in optimal absorption influenced by Fext. The electron–hole coherence and charge difference density visualized results, associated with the calculated charge-transfer length further support the conclusion that the excited state properties of charge transfer are strongly dependent on the external electric fields. Importantly, an effective and integrated framework to deeply investigate the excited-state charge transfer dynamics and to predict D⋯A materials of OPVs is represented systematically.

 	Fig. 1  The HOMO and LUMO energy levels (a), excitation energy of the lowest ICT state (b), and the energy gap of (LUMO+3)–HOMO and LUMO–(HOMO−1) energy levels (c) of the PCDTBT:PC70BM blend plotted versus the external electric field.	 

 	Fig. 2  The 2D contour plots of the selected transition density matrix of the PCDTBT:PC70BM blend with different excited-state properties. The colour bar is shown (absolute values of matrix elements, scaled to a maximum value of 1.0), and the electron–hole coherence increases with the increase of absolute values of matrix elements.	 

 	Fig. 3  Selected charge difference densities (CDD) of the PCDTBT:PC70BM blend in different external electric fields. (Fext in 10−5 au) Green and red color represents holes and electrons, respectively.	 
	(2)

 	Fig. 4  Charge transfer length of different excited states in different external electric fields.
