In recent years an increased effort has been dedicated to manufacturing cheap and efficient solar cells based on organic materials, because organic solar cells (OSCs) possess the advantages of low cost, light weight, and flexibility, and are a promising cost-effective alternative to silicon-based solar cells.1 However, even with the performance in terms of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and operational stability rapidly approaching key targets on a laboratory scale, research directed towards the processing of large area flexible solar cells has been very limited, possibly due to the economical aspect of acquiring and running the necessary machinery and the selective focus on reaching high PCEs. The majority of OSCs reported comprise a small active area (<0.1 cm2) and are prepared by a combination of spin coating and vacuum evaporation on rigid glass substrates in a protective atmosphere, which has proven highly successful on the laboratory scale with PCEs of up to 10% reported,2 but these processing techniques are not roll-to-roll and industry compatible. Thus, novel processing methodologies are urgently needed for a faster and more direct transfer of OSCs from the laboratory to larger scale coating facilities. Recently, slot-die roll coating, knife coating, gravure printing, flexographic printing, etc., have been explored and used in the preparation of roll-to-roll flexible solar cells based on polymer materials.1c
Compared to conjugated polymers,3 small molecules offer potential advantages such as defined molecular structure, definite molecular weight, easy purification, and good batch-to-batch reproducibility.1a,4 So far, the highest reported PCEs of OSCs based on small molecule donors and fullerene acceptors are as high as 8–9%.5 However, to our knowledge, there has been no report on small molecule based roll-to-roll OSC devices, probably due to the relatively poor film forming property and low viscosity of small molecules.
In our previous paper, we reported the synthesis of a star-shaped amorphous molecule S(TPA-DPP) (Fig. 1) based on triphenylamine as the core and diketopyrrolopyrrole as arms.6 Like other triphenylamine7 and diketopyrrolopyrrole based small molecules,8 S(TPA-DPP) possesses excellent solution-processed film-forming properties. In thin film, S(TPA-DPP) shows a broad absorption band of 300–700 nm with an optical band gap of 1.85 eV. The HOMO and LUMO energies of S(TPA-DPP) are −5.26 and −3.26 eV, respectively. The HOMO and LUMO energies are higher than those (−5.93 and −3.91 eV) of [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM, Fig. 1), respectively;9 the LUMO gap (0.65 eV) and HOMO gap (0.67 eV) between S(TPA-DPP) and PCBM are large enough to guarantee efficient exciton dissociation.10 S(TPA-DPP) exhibits a relatively high hole mobility of up to 3.85 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1.11 Small size devices based on S(TPA-DPP):PCBM exhibit PCEs of 1.1–1.2%.11,12

In this work we report the first small molecule roll-to-roll flexible solar cells produced from slot-die coating on a lab-scale mini roll-coater, using S(TPA-DPP):PCBM active materials and poly(ethyleneterephthalate) (PET) with Ag grid substrates. Fabrication of our small molecule flexible solar cells does not require the use of indium tin oxide (ITO), vacuum evaporation or spin-coating. A slot-die roll-coater,13 which was designed and developed for the challenging task of enabling a time- and material-efficient optimization of a continuous coating process, was used for coating the active layer and the top poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) layer, while the front and back silver electrodes were printed using a patterned rubber roller. The cells were fabricated in an inverted structure on a flexible substrate, which was composed of a PET foil with a silver grid, highly conductive PEDOT:PSS and a doped ZnO electron transport layer (Fig. 2a).14 A thick PEDOT:PSS layer was applied as a hole transport top layer. The silver electrodes were coated from a Dupont PV410 silver paste.

((1) The roll for moving and/or annealing the substrate; (2) the pump to control the flow rate of ink; (3) the slot-die head to coat the film; (4) a rubber roller for printing silver). 
The motorized roll of the mini roll-coater can be heated to an elevated temperature of over 180 °C and has a diameter of 300 mm, so that a flexible substrate 1 m in length can be mounted and dried directly on the roll. By using a small slot-die head, and allowing the head to be translated perpendicular to the coating direction following every complete revolution of the roll, it is possible to coat several stripes on one substrate to enable an effective substrate length of several metres (Fig. 2b). When the coating system is equipped with the small slot-die head it requires a very small amount of dead volume (<100 μL), which makes the technique well suited for screening of novel and expensive inks. After successively coating the active layer and the back PEDOT:PSS layer (Fig. 2c), the roller was kept at 80 °C for about 20 min to facilitate the drying of the films, and then the silver electrodes were printed using a patterned rubber roller (Fig. 2d). No ITO, vacuum or spin-coating were used in the process, and the preparation of hundreds of solar cells could be performed in one continuous process within 2 h. On one piece of PET substrate, ca. 150 devices can be fabricated (Fig. 2e), and we randomly measured over 40% of these devices.
We prepared active-material inks comprising a blend of S(TPA-DPP):PCBM (1:1.5, w/w) in different solvents, such as toluene, dichloromethane (DCM), chloroform and chlorobenzene (CB). Due to the relatively low solubility (ca. 12 mg mL−1) of S(TPA-DPP) in toluene, the active layer coated from toluene solution is very thin, which decreased the device yield. Of the devices prepared from toluene solution, there were <5% working devices. The highest PCE is 0.06%, with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.72 V, a short circuit current density (JSC) of 0.27 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.33 (Fig. 3a). The devices produced from DCM and chloroform solutions have 30–40% device yield; the PCEs of the devices are improved to 0.09% and 0.14%, respectively. The low solubility of PCBM in DCM and chloroform limits the total concentration of S(TPA-DPP):PCBM and the device yield. Compared to toluene, DCM and chloroform, CB is a better solvent for both S(TPA-DPP) and PCBM; in CB solution, the total concentration of the S(TPA-DPP):PCBM blend can be improved to 80 mg mL−1. High concentration solutions with relatively good film-forming property and high viscosity further facilitate the production of thick active layers and improve the solar cell yield. CB solutions with different concentrations of 40, 60 and 80 mg mL−1 were used for printing active layers. There were almost no working devices prepared from the 40 mg mL−1 CB solution. 50% of the devices produced from 60 mg mL−1 CB solution worked, with PCEs up to 0.21% and a VOC of 0.75 V, a JSC of 0.93 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.30. Over 95% of the devices coated from 80 mg mL−1 CB solution worked and showed a PCE of 0.17% (Table 1). Despite the relatively low PCEs of these roll-to-roll devices relative to those of small area solar cells fabricated on ITO-coated glass substrates, these results demonstrate that small molecule materials can be applied in large area roll-to-roll flexible solar cells.

A light beam induced current (LBIC) technique was employed to gain insight into the solar cell behavior, combined with optical imaging for the mapping of S(TPA-DPP):PCBM devices printed from 80 mg mL−1 CB solution (Fig. 3b). The lighter color represents a stronger current response, while the darker color represents a weaker current response under the same laser intensity.15 There is a good current response over the whole region due to the low concentration of defects in the devices.
The active layer morphology of the OSC devices prepared from DCM, chloroform and CB solutions was examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode. Fig. 4 shows the AFM height and phase images of the blend films of S(TPA-DPP):PCBM from different solutions. The blend films based on S(TPA-DPP):PCBM exhibited typical cluster structures with many crystalline domains and very smooth surfaces, with root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.24–0.36 nm. The domain sizes estimated by cross-section profiles are tens of nanometers. Compared to the film coated from DCM or chloroform solution, the film coated from CB solution shows smaller size domains, which is beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport.

In conclusion, we demonstrate the first example of small-molecule roll-to-roll flexible solar cells fabricated by slot-die coating and flexographic printing under ambient conditions. The devices fabricated from a CB solution of S(TPA-DPP):PCBM (w/w, 1:1.5) blend exhibited PCEs of up to 0.21% and yields as high as 95%. Although the PCEs of these roll-to-roll flexible devices are relatively low compared to those of small area solar cells fabricated on ITO-coated glass substrates, this preliminary work demonstrates that small molecule materials have potential for use in roll-to-roll flexible solar cells, and flexible small molecule based solar cells can be prepared in air without ITO, vacuum steps or spin-coating.
