    , Accepted 16th August 2016First published on 16th August 2016AbstractSchottky junctions formed between semiconductors and metal contacts are ubiquitous in modern electronic and optoelectronic devices. Here we report on the physical properties of Schottky-junctions formed on hybrid perovskite CH3NH3PbBr3 single crystals. It is found that light illumination can significantly increase the dielectric constant of perovskite junctions by 2300%. Furthermore, such Pt/perovskite junctions are used to fabricate self-biased photodetectors. A photodetectivity of 1.4 × 1010 Jones is obtained at zero bias, which increases to 7.1 × 1011 Jones at a bias of +3 V, and the photodetectivity remains almost constant in a wide range of light intensity. These devices also exhibit fast responses with a rising time of 70 μs and a falling time of 150 μs. As a result of the high crystal quality and low defect density, such single-crystal photodetectors show stable performance after storage in air for over 45 days. Our results suggest that hybrid perovskite single crystals provide a new platform to develop promising optoelectronic applications.
1. Introduction
Recently, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl−, Br−, I−, or their mixtures) have been intensively explored for applications in solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.1–19 As a new class of semiconductors, these materials feature extraordinary physical properties including high carrier mobility, large light absorption coefficient, low exciton binding energy and long carrier diffusion length.15–23 Recently, hybrid perovskite single crystals have been synthesized and they possess properties superior to the polycrystalline counterparts as a result of their structural integrity.21–23 Investigating basic electronic devices based on perovskite single crystals could avoid some of the extrinsic effects in polycrystalline films related to structural defects and grain boundaries. Schottky junctions formed at metal/semiconductor interfaces are ubiquitous in modern electronic and optoelectronic devices. The aim of this work is to investigate the physical properties and device functionalities of Schottky junctions fabricated on perovskite single crystals.
As one of the key figures of merit, the high dielectric constant of lead halide perovskites directly leads to their low exciton binding energy (Eb), which is a paramount requirement to generate a strong photovoltaic effect. According to recent theoretical and experimental studies, the exciton binding energy Eb of CH3NH3PbI3 is between 20–50 meV,24–27 which is much smaller than that of organic materials (Eb = 0.2 eV to 1 eV).28,29 This large difference in binding energies is attributed to the difference of their dielectric constants,30 and the high dielectric constant is also responsible for the high power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells.31 Clearly, detailed study of photo-induced modulation of dielectric constant will provide a unique platform to explore these new photovoltaic materials with superior opto-electronic device performance.
In terms of optoelectronic applications, light-modulated transport properties of metal–semiconductor junctions underlies the operation of photodetectors which are used in a wide range of technologies such as remote sensing, environmental monitoring, space exploration, optical communication.32–39 Most photodetectors require voltage bias to achieve practical photo responsivity and photo detectivity.40 However, installation of an external power source or battery makes the overall circuitry complex and expensive.41 Therefore, it is beneficial to develop “self-biased” photodetectors which can produce self-sufficient potential for operation. Photodiodes made of Schottky or p–n junctions are prominent examples in this desirable class of self-biased photodetectors.42,43
A significant amount of application-oriented efforts have been devoted to developing photodetectors based on emerging materials such as quantum dots, ZnO nanorods, graphene, MoS2, and so on.33,34,36–44 Dou et al. reported hybrid perovskite photodetectors with high detectivity using a solar-cell-type structure with electron/hole transporting layers.45 In addition, there have been several recent works on photodetectors based on polycrystalline perovskite thin films and nanowires.46–52 High-quality single crystals are known to possess advantages such as good crystallinity, chemical purity and high-mobility transport, which are desired for building photodetectors.53,54 There have been pioneering works on using hybrid perovskite single crystals in narrow-band photodetectors18 and UV photodetectors.17 However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no report on constructing self-biased photodetectors using Schottky junctions of hybrid perovskite single crystals.
In this work, we report on the light-modulated dielectric and transport properties of Schottky junctions built on CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite single crystals. Among the well-studied hybrid perovskites, CH3NH3PbCl3 does not absorb visible light due to its wide band gap (2.9 eV);55 therefore, it is not suitable for constructing devices working in the visible regime. CH3NH3PbI3 has been extensively used as light absorber, and its carrier mobility is comparable to that of CH3NH3PbBr3,23 but it is much less stable.56 Among the hybrid perovskites, CH3NH3PbBr3 is stable with a cubic lattice structure at room temperature, and the growth of large CH3NH3PbBr3 single crystals with smooth flat surfaces facilitates the electrode deposition in photodetector fabrication.23 Therefore, CH3NH3PbBr3 single crystals were chosen in this report for constructing a prototypical self-biased single-crystal perovskite photodetector. Photodetectivity up to 1.4 × 1010 Jones and response time on the order of 100 microseconds were observed. Importantly, these single-crystal photodetectors presented stable performance in air for over 45 days. Our results indicate that high-quality hybrid perovskite single crystals are promising to serve as highly tunable dielectric materials as well as active components in optoelectronic devices.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis and device fabrication
The CH3NH3PbBr3 single crystals were prepared by the modified antisolvent vapor-assisted crystallization method reported elsewhere.23 In order to reduce the parasitic resistance; these single crystals were mechanically polished to a thickness of approximately 150 μm. A semitransparent Pt layer of 20 nm was deposited by sputtering on one surface of the single crystal as the top electrode, and 100 nm Au was deposited on the opposite surface of the crystal as the bottom electrode. As reference samples, thin films of CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite were prepared by two-step sequential method. The glass substrate was coated with 100 nm Au and 220 nm PbBr2 layers using thermal evaporation, and then the sample was dipped in solution containing CH3NH3Br, followed by heating at 70 °C to form the perovskite film with a thickness of 300 nm.
2.2 Characterizations
X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were obtained for single crystal and thin film of CH3NH3PbBr3, using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer. A field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Nova Nano-SEM) was used to acquire cross-section SEM images of single crystal. Thicknesses of thin film were measured using a Veeco Dektak 150 surface profilometer. UV-Vis absorption spectra of the CH3NH3PbBr3 single crystal were recorded on a Varian Cary 6000i spectrophotometer. Spectral dielectric constant and photo-response was measured using a Newport Oriel QE/IPCE measurement kit with a silicon photodiode detector. The dielectric constant measurements were carried out on an Agilent Precision LCR Meter. During the measurements no external DC voltage (zero bias) applied to the photodetectors. The current–voltage (I–V) measurements were performed on a probe station connected to a Keithley 4200 semiconducting analyzer. The transient photo responses were measured on an oscilloscope; light with wavelength of 532 nm and intensity of 1 mW cm−2 was used at a chopping frequency of 400 Hz.
3. Results

Fig. 1(a) shows the energy band alignment between CH3NH3PbBr3 and metal electrodes in the heterojunction device.57–59 The high work function of Pt is expected to lead to the formation of a Schottky junction.60 As previously reported by Dong et al., materials with high work functions such as MoO3 are effective to realize Schottky junctions when come in contact with perovskites.52 On the other hand, the work function of Au is much smaller than that of Pt, which might result in ohmic contact and good charge transport. Recently, Huang et al. demonstrated ohmic transport when Au was coated on both sides of perovskite single crystals.22

Also shown is the XRD pattern of the CH3NH3PbBr3 single crystal. 

Fig. 1(b) shows the basic operation mechanism of the Pt–CH3NH3PbBr3–Au photodetector under light illumination. At the Pt–perovskite junction, the Schottky barrier is formed and the build-in bias is approximately 0.5 V. Under the light illumination, the photo-excited electron–hole pairs in the depletion layer are efficiently separated by the built-in field and subsequently collected by the electrodes. Herein, the top Pt electrode not only acts as the hole collector, but also allows the light to illuminate through as a result of its semitransparent nature.
The schematic device structure of the single-crystal photodetector is shown in Fig. 1(c). A semitransparent Pt layer with a thickness of 20 nm was deposited on the CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite single crystal as the top electrode, and its transmittance was measured to be ∼20% in the visible range (ESI,† Fig. S1). A layer of 100 nm Au was deposited on the opposite side of the single crystal as the bottom electrode. The photograph of CH3NH3PbBr3 single crystal based photodetector is shown in Fig. 1(d). The CH3NH3PbBr3 single crystal has a bright orange colour. Fig. 1(e) shows the absorption spectrum of the perovskite single crystal, and the absorption edge at 565 nm is consistent with bandgap of CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite (2.2 eV). The crystal thickness was estimated to be approximately 150 μm as shown in Fig. 1(f). Also shown in Fig. 1(f) is the XRD pattern of the CH3NH3PbBr3 single crystal, and the sharp peaks labelled by the respective miller indices confirm the high sample purity.
Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the single-crystal perovskite photodetector measured under dark and light conditions are shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b). A nonlinear and asymmetric behavior with hysteresis was observed in the dark I–V curve. This rectifying behavior is consistent with the formation of Schottky junction at the Pt–perovskite interface. Fitting the I–V curves to the Schottky diode model provides insights into the operation of these single-crystal photodetectors. Cheung et al. proposed the following equation to extract the diode parameters:61 (1)where, RS is the diode series resistance, n the ideality factor, T the temperature and k the Boltzmann constant. Fig. 2(c) shows the plot of d(V)/d(lnI) vs. I measured in dark for the forward current direction. The ideality factor (n) is an important parameter that can be used to understand our devices with reference to the ideal Schottky diode behavior. The value of extracted ideality factor (n = 1.7) confirms that the Pt/CH3NH3PbBr3 junction roughly follows the ideal Schottky behavior, and the observed deviation of ideality factor from 1 could be caused by extrinsic factors like leakage current and junction inhomogeneity.62,63 Furthermore, the ideality factor increases significantly up to 3.3 as shown in Fig. 2(d) when the device is under light illumination, which can be attributed to the generation and recombination of photo-induced carriers.64,65 Concurrently, the series resistance decreases from 169.2 kΩ to 212.2 Ω due to the photoconductive nature of the perovskite single crystal.

Fig. 3(a) shows the dielectric constant (ε′) of the perovskite single-crystal measured as a function of frequency under dark and white light conditions. The measurements were done at room temperature in the frequency range of 150 Hz–1 MHz. When a 100 mW cm−2 white light was illuminated on the crystal, a 10-fold enhancement of the dielectric constant at lower frequency was observed. The percentage of change in dark dielectric constant after illumination was found to be 2300% at 150 Hz. This significant change in dielectric constant indicates the presence of photo-dielectric effect in the CH3NH3PbBr3 single crystal. There have been different mechanisms proposed for the origin of photo-dielectric effect, such as changes in dipole moment due to photo-induced carriers,66 formation of photo-induced polar domains67 and modification of local unit cell equilibrium.20 Our result indicates that such a light-induced modulation of dielectric properties exists in not only in thin films and composites but also in high-quality pure-phase perovskite single crystals.

(b) AC conductivity measured as function of frequency. (c) Dielectric constant at 10 kHz measured as a function of wavelength. (d) Dielectric constant measured at different frequencies under the illumination with varying white light intensities. 
As shown in Fig. 3(a), ε′ under light illumination initially falls quickly with increasing frequency and then becomes almost constant at high frequencies (up to 1 MHz). This high frequency behaviour arises due to the lagging of polarization with applied oscillating field at high frequencies.68 In the present case, most likely, more than one type of ions, e.g., CH3NH3+ and Pb+, contribute to the relaxation process. The dispersion behavior of the dielectric constant can be described by the Debye model:69 (2)where, ε′ is the real part of dielectric constant, ε∞′ dielectric constant at the high frequency limit, dielectric constant at the low frequency limit, ω the angular frequency, i.e., 2πf, τ the relaxation time and α′ the spreading factor of actual relaxation time about the mean position or the Debye's distribution parameter. The straight line fit to a plot of logε0′ − ε∞′/ε′ − ε∞′ vs. logω shown in ESI,† Fig. S2 gives the slope, i.e., α′ and the intercept, i.e., τ. Using these parameters the frequency-dependent dielectric constant was calculated and plotted along with the experimental data in Fig. 3(a). It was found that the experimentally obtained relaxation behavior of dielectric constant follows well the Debye model. Also, it is interesting to note that a quicker dielectric relaxation time was observed after light illumination i.e. for dark τ = 310 ms, and under light illumination τ = 12 ms. This indicates that relaxation process reveals that illumination of light reduces the delay of polarization switching with increasing frequency.70

Fig. 3(b) shows the AC conductivity of the single crystal heterojunction measured under dark and light conditions as a function of frequency. The AC conductivity can be written as:71 σAC = ωε0ε′tanδ(3)where, ω is the angular frequency 2πf, ε0 the permittivity of free space and tanδ the dielectric loss. When the measurement frequency is high enough, the AC conductivity of a disordered solid can be written as:72 (4)where σDC is the DC conductivity, ωc is the critical frequency i.e. the frequency at which the conduction process switches to capacitive behavior, and the parameter n is zero for a regular conductor and 1 for a perfect insulator. As rule of thumb, for a disordered solid or insulating material, 0.6 < n < 1.0, whereas for ordered solid or conducting material, n < 0.6. A linear fit in the high-frequency range can give the slope, i.e., the parameter n and the intercept, i.e., σDC. Interestingly, the value of n = 0.70 measured in the dark condition indicates the insulating nature of the perovskite single crystal. Under the illumination of light, it decreased to n = 0.34, indicating that the light-generated carriers significantly enhance the conduction of the sample. In addition, light illumination might lead to some kind of ordering, particularly improved alignment of dipoles, within the single crystal. In a recent report, a similar photo-induced change of dielectric constant was ascribed to the modification of local unit cell equilibrium.20
In order to further quantify the dielectric properties of the single crystal photodetector, we performed wavelength and light intensity dependent measurements. The photo-induced dielectric constant measured as a function of wavelength at a light intensity of 10 mW cm−2 is shown in Fig. 3(c). This wavelength dependent result is consistent with the optical absorption data shown in Fig. 1(c). A sharp absorption edge around 565 nm is characteristic of the band gap absorption for CH3NH3PbBr3 single crystal.73 Accordingly, the photo-dielectric effect disappears above the wavelength corresponding to the perovskite band gap.74 To acquire a deeper understanding into the photo-induced dielectric tunability in perovskite single crystals, the dielectric constant at 10 kHz was measured under the illumination of different light intensities. Fig. 3(d) shows that the dielectric constant decreases with decreasing light intensity. Also, a power law can be applied to describe the relationship between the dielectric constant and the light intensity:75 Intensity = kε′θ,(5)where k is a proportionality constant. Furthermore, the power law fitting revealed that the exponent θ decreases with the measurement frequency as a result of the dielectric dispersion behavior.
Now we turn to the light response properties of the single-crystal perovskite heterojunction. The semi-log I–V plots for the single-crystal perovskite photodetector measured under dark and light conditions are shown in Fig. 4(a). The slight hysteresis could be related to the voltage-induced drift of ions, as recently reported.76 When the device was illuminated with white light (intensity: 100 mW cm−2), photocurrent at zero bias was enhanced by more than three orders of magnitude, corresponding to an on/off ratio of ∼1 × 104. The observed self-biased photosensitivity can be attributed to the emergence of an open-circuit voltage of approximately 250 mV in the I–V curve under illumination, indicating that the photo-excited electron–hole pairs are effectively separated by the built-in field at the Pt–perovskite Schottky junction. The ON–OFF characteristics of the photocurrent were also measured at zero bias for the perovskite photodetector under alternating dark and light conditions. The data in Fig. 4(b) clearly show that the zero-bias photocurrent remains stable and can be reliably switched.

(b) Photocurrent response measured at zero bias under alternating dark and light conditions. (c) Transient photo response measured on the single-crystal CH3NH3PbBr3 photodetector. 
Responsivity (R) and detectivity (D) are important performance parameters of photodetectors. The responsivity indicates how efficiently the devices convert light to photocurrent, and it can be calculated as (6)where, ILight and IDark are the photocurrent and dark current of the photodetector, respectively, and P is the incident light intensity.48 When the dark current is dominated by the shot noise, which is often the case of Schottky-type photodetectors, the detectivity can be calculated as (7)where q is the elementary charge and Jd is the dark current density.45 Apparently, it is important to suppress the dark current in order to increase the photodetectivity. Thus, the good crystalline quality of perovskite single crystals is beneficial to reduce the leakage current and to improve the photodetectivity of fabricated devices.
The responsivity and detectivity of our single-crystal perovskite photodetectors were calculated as 2 mA W−1 and 1.4 × 1010 Jones at zero bias, respectively. At an applied bias of +3 V, the responsivity and detectivity increase to 100 mA W−1 and 7.1 × 1011 Jones, respectively. The performance of our devices is comparable with the previously reported CH3NH3PbI3-based photodetector with electron/hole transporting layers.45 Using a solar-cell-type photodetector, Dou et al. reported a very high detectivity of 1014 Jones,45 but their multilayer structure is much more complex than ours. In another recent study,50 CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 photodetectors were reported to exhibit a responsivity of 0.49 μA W−1. By using perovskite–graphene composites in hybrid photodetectors, Lee et al. reported a photodetectivity of 107 Jones.49 Recently, self-powered photodetectors were also realized in CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO and CH3NH3PbI3–CH3NH3PbBr3 thin film heterojunctions,77,78 but their device architectures are different from our metal/perovskite Schottky junctions. A detailed comparison between the published results and ours is shown in ESI,† Table S1.
We also fabricated a photodetector based on CH3NH3PbBr3 thin films with the device structure similar to the single-crystal counterpart. It should be noted that the thickness of perovskite film affects the photodetector performance. A film too thin results in poor light harvesting, while a film too thick causes high charge recombination resistance. The optimized thickness of perovskite film is around 300 nm, which is consistent with the reports in literature. Fig. S3(a) (ESI†) shows the I–V characteristic of the thin-film device measured in dark and light conditions. The photodetectivity is about 2.7 × 107 Jones and the response time is on the scale of milliseconds (Fig. S3(b), ESI†). This comparison indicates that a better performance can be obtained using grain-boundary-free single crystals, which possess advantages such as low trap density, long carrier diffusion length and high mobility. Furthermore, to determine the effect of chemical composition, the performance of a photodetector based on CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal was examined and the result is shown in ESI,† Fig. S4. Its photodetectivity is approximately 2 × 109 Jones, comparable to the result of CH3NH3PbBr3 single crystal device, but it decreased by two orders of magnitude after being kept in air for 3 days, which is a result of the lower stability of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite in comparison to the Br one.79,80
Furthermore, we measured the response time of the single-crystal perovskite photodetector, which is another key criterion of device performance. The time required for the photocurrent to increase from 10% to 90% in the alternating dark and light conditions is generally defined as the rise time (ton) of photodetectors, and vice versa for the definition of the decay time (toff).52 We performed temporal photoresponse measurements with a light intensity of 1 mW cm−2 and a chopping frequency of 400 Hz. As shown in Fig. 4(c), for the self-biased single-crystal photodetector, the rise time ton is 70 μs and the decay time toff is 150 μs. These photoresponse speeds are approximately 103 times higher than those recently reported for photodetectors based on CH3NH3PbBr3 nanowires (ton = 120 ms and toff = 86 ms)46 and CH3NH3PbI3–CH3NH3PbBr3 heterojunctions (ton = 120 ms and toff = 94 ms).78 Using PEDOT:PSS and PCBM as charge transporting layers, Dou et al. reported that their perovskite photodetectors could operate in the MHz regime.45 Thanks to their high structural quality and low defect density, the photo response of single-crystal photodetectors was faster than the control device based on Schottky junctions of CH3NH3PbBr3 thin films (ESI,† Fig. S3(b)). Compared with other perovskite-film-based photodetectors without using electron/hole transporting layers,48,50 the much faster photoresponse of our devices could be attributed to the high carrier mobility and low defect traps of the perovskite single crystals.
It is well recognized that the configuration of photodetectors directly influences the device performance. As an important factor influencing the detector speed, the transit time Ttr, which describes how fast photocarriers drift across the photodetectors, is given by the following equation:81 (8)where L is the inter-electrode spacing (150 μm in the measured device), V is the built-in or applied bias and μn is the charge mobility. Clearly, the high mobility of CH3NH3PbBr3 single crystal (115 cm2 V−1 s−1) helps reduce the transit time.23 For the self-biased photodetector, the built-in bias Vbi can be calculated as Vbi = ΦM − Φs, where ΦM and Φs are the work functions of metal and semiconductor, respectively. Using the reported work functions reported in literature for Pt and perovskite,57,58Vbi can be calculated as approximately 0.5 V. Then, according to eqn (8), the transit time is estimated as approximately 3.9 μs. The difference in the transit time and the actual measured decay time indicates that other effects like RC time constant, which is associated with the capacitance (C) and the resistance (R) of the photodetector, significantly influence the photoresponse speed.81 Using a planar device configuration may enhance the photodetector speed,82 but it is challenging to fabricate the interdigitated electrodes with two different metals to retain the self-biased functionality of Schottky junctions. Further efforts such as thinning down the single crystals to reduce Ttr and R are needed to improve the photoresponse speed of our Schottky-type single-crystal photodetectors. Because of their brittle nature, conventional mechanical thinning approaches are not suitable to process such perovskite single crystals. Clearly, developing new growth and processing strategies is necessary to achieve the optimal performance of such single-crystal-based devices.
We further measured the responsivity and detectivity of the single-crystal detector as a function of wavelengths. The spectral response from 350 nm to 800 nm is shown in Fig. 5(a). The photodetector exhibits the highest self-biased detectivity of 3.1 × 1010 Jones under the illumination of UV light (350 nm), while weaker response was observed at longer wavelengths.
 Fig. 5  (a) Responsivity and detectivity of the photodetector measured as a function of wavelength. (b) Photocurrent (circles) and detectivity (squares) measured at zero bias for the CH3NH3PbBr3 photodetector under different white light intensities. The straight line is the power law fitting. Also shown are the photocurrent data (solid spheres) measured on the same photodetector after being stored in air for 45 days. 
The increase in responsivity and detectivity below 400 nm might be due to the enhanced electron transition from valence band to conduction band under the excitation of high-energy photons.83 A similar rise in responsivity in shorter wavelength was observed by Xin et al. in photodetectors based on perovskite thin films.48 Furthermore, the photodetectivity suddenly dropped by approximately one order of magnitude at 560 nm. This result is consistent with the absorption data of the CH3NH3PbBr3 single crystal shown in Fig. 1(e), indicating that light absorption dictates the operation of such photodetectors. This strong absorption-detectivity correlation also points out the perspective of leveraging on the different band gaps of perovskites to construct photodetectors operating in selective wavelength ranges.
Dependence of detectivity on light intensity is another essential figure-of-merit for photodetectors. Fig. 5(b) shows the data of intensity-dependent photocurrent measured on the single-crystal photodetector. The variation of photocurrent with light intensity is usually described by a simple power law, I = αPθ, with P and α being light intensity and constant, respectively.84 The value of θ lies between 0.5 and 1, depending on the presence of trap states and the associated charge recombination.85 In the present case, the intensity-dependent photocurrent data fall onto a straight line with θ = 1, indicating that there exist only shallow (low-energy) traps, which is an essential condition for photodetectors with good performance.23 As a result of this linear intensity dependence, the detectivity of the single-crystal photodetector remained at approximately 1 × 1010 Jones within the range of measured light intensity.
In addition, as shown in Fig. 5(b), the photodetector retained its initial photocurrent after being kept in air for 45 days, giving further support to its stable performance. The mechanism behind the observed high stability of single-crystal device is two-fold. In one aspect, perovskite single crystals possess more structural integrity than thin films. It is known that hybrid perovskites tend to degenerate into their precursors due to the hygroscopic nature of amine salts, and degeneration starts at sites of structural defects and grain boundaries.79 Different from the polycrystalline films, perovskite single crystals are free from grain boundaries and can remain stable in air for over one month. In the work of Wang and co-workers, good stability of a self-powered photodetector based on ZnO/CH3NH3PbI3 heterojunctions was achieved by a top MoO3 layer which prevents moisture penetration.77 In the other aspect, when I− ions (radius: 2.2 Å) in CH3NH3PbI3 is replaced with smaller Br− ions (radius: 1.96 Å), cubic crystal structure can be stabilized at room temperature and perovskite becomes less sensitive to moisture.56,58
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a photo-dielectric effect and self-biased photo-detection via building Schottky junctions on high-quality perovskite CH3NH3PbBr3 single crystals. High values of dielectric constant under light illumination supports the possibility of light induced ordering in the perovskite single crystal. These devices are different from the previous reports on using hybrid perovskite single crystals in narrowband photodetectors18 and UV detectors.17 Owing to the excellent absorption and transport properties of hybrid perovskites, our CH3NH3PbBr3-based devices exhibit promising properties such as a detectivity of 1.4 × 1010 Jones at zero bias and response times on the scale of 100 μs. Such an approach of constructing Schottky-type single-crystal CH3NH3PbBr3 detectors with high performance and self-biased capability can be applied other hybrid perovskites with different compositions and band gaps.
