, Accepted 27th January 2016First published on 29th January 2016AbstractWe here describe the synthesis, characterization, and structures of new semiconducting polymers (PIQP2T and PTPQ2T) based on amide-bridged terphenyl (IQP) and dithienylbenzene (TPQ), and their performances in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs). The polymers are found to have relatively wide band gaps of >2.0 eV and deep HOMO energy levels of −5.4 eV. Interestingly both the HOMO and LUMO energy levels similarly shift upward and downward, respectively, by the π-extension from the monomer unit to the polymer, which can be ascribed to the delocalized HOMO and LUMO along the molecular frameworks. This suggests that IQP and TPQ can be viewed as electron-neutral building units. Both polymers had similar ordering structures in the thin film despite the fact that the IQP is more sterically hindered at the end of the moiety than TPQ. This is probably due to the strong intermolecular interactions originating in the amide group. The polymers exhibited similar hole mobilities of 0.03–0.04 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the OFET devices. Although the PCEs were modest, the OPV devices based on these polymers showed a quite high VOC of 0.94 V.
Introduction
Semiconducting polymers are an important class of materials that can be used as the active layers for organic optoelectronic devices such as transistors (OFETs), and photovoltaics (OPVs).1,2 In the development of semiconducting polymers, synthetic chemists must carefully design the backbone structure to have strong intermolecular interactions and thus good ordering structures as well as suitable electronic structures.3–5 Since the π-building unit is the most important component of the polymer that determines the ordering and electronic structures, the exploration of new π-building units is crucial for the materials development.
Bridged oligo-arylenes/heteroarylenes consisting of phenylene and thiophene are widely studied π-building units so far. Terphenyl or dithienylbenzene bridged with substituted C,6–10 Si,11 Ge,11,12 N,13–17 and olefin18,19 (Fig. 1) offer good optical and electrical properties when incorporated in donor–acceptor (D–A) semiconducting polymers, where they act as donor units. Bridging of terphenyl or dithienylbenzene moieties can suppress the distortion of the aryl–aryl linkage, which would offer rigidity and coplanarity and thus strong interemolecular interaction, in turn leading to good ordering in thin films.20 The use of amide or imide containing building unit, such as diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP),21,22 isoindigo (IID),23,24 thienopyrroledione (TPD),25,26 bithiopheneimide (BTI),27,28 and naphthalenedicarboximide (NDI)29–31 (Fig. 2) in semiconducting polymers is also a promising strategy to offer strong intermolecular interaction and thus good ordering structure in thin films. Such good ordering structure in those polymers is believed to originate in the local dipole of amide and/or imide substructures,32 as well as in the donor–acceptor backbone, where they act as the acceptor units.

Recently, Kim and co-workers reported on amide-bridged dithienylbenzene, 5,11-dihydrothieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrido[2,3-g]thieno[3,2-c]quinoline-4,10-dione (TPQ, Fig. 3) and its copolymers.33 On the other hand, Ding and co-workers reported on an isomeric structure of TPQ, namely, thieno[2′,3′:5,6]pyrido[3,4-g]thieno[3,2-c]isoquinoline-5,11-dione (TPTI, Fig. 3) and its copolymers.34 Independently, we have also been investigating a series of amide-bridged oligoarylenes such as TPQ and 6,13-dihydroisoquinolino[3,4-b]phenanthridine-5,12-dione (IQP, Fig. 3) where terphenyl is the platform. Herein, we describe the synthesis of IQP and TPQ and the corresponding polymers, their properties, thin film structures, and OFET and OPV performance. It is interesting to note that, in contrast to the fact that the most of amide or imide bridged building units has strong electron deficient nature, IQP and TPQ are found to be “electron-neutral” building units35 when incorporated in the π-conjugated polymer backbone. Although TPQ-based polymers were reported to show low field-effect mobilities of around 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1,33 the TPQ-based polymer synthesized in this work exhibited mobilities as high as 0.03 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was comparable to those for the IQP-based polymer. Furthermore, the both TPQ- and IQP-based polymers were found to provide high open-circuit voltages (VOCs) of 0.94 V in the OPV devices.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
Scheme 1 shows the synthetic route to the IQP monomer and the corresponding polymer (PIQP2T), where bithiophene was used as the co-unit. First, we have attempted to synthesize the IQP monomer via preparation of IQP (route A). 1 was reacted with 2-iodobenzoic acid methyl ester via the Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction, in which the cross-coupling and cyclization were underwent sequentially in one-pot, yielding IQP. However, alkylation reaction did not afford N,N′-dialkyl-IQP (2), and instead it afforded the lactim tautomer (3) in a moderate yield. Similar reaction has been observed for a tetracyclic lactam compound, 4,9-dihydro-dithieno[3,2-c:3′,2′-h][1,5]naphthyridine-5,10-dione.36 Therefore, we alternatively attempted to prepare a N,N′-dialkyl-IQP derivative via the route B, where the alkyl groups were introduced before the formation of the IQP moiety. 1,4-Dibromo-2,5-phenylenediboronate (4) was synthesized from 1,4-dibromobenzene. In the meantime, 5-bromo-2-iodobenzoyl chloride was treated with 2-decyltetradecan-1-amine to give an N-alkylbenzamide 5. 4 and 5 were then cross-coupled to afford the precursor 6, which was then cyclized via the Ullmann-type reaction, yielding the desired dibrominated monomer (7). 7 was copolymerized with distannylated bithiophene via the Stille coupling reaction to afford PIQP2T.

Scheme 2 depicts the synthesis of the TPQ monomer and the corresponding copolymer (PTPQ2T), in which the similar synthetic protocol to PIQP2T was used. 3-Thiophenecarboxylic acid was brominated at the 5-position, giving 8, which was subsequently iodinated at the 2-position (9). 9 was converted into acid chloride and then treated with 2-decyltetradecan-1-amine to afford N-alkylthiophenecarboxamide 10. 10 was cross-coupled with 4 to give 11, which was then cyclized to yield the TPQ monomer (12). 12 was copolymerized with distannylated bithiophene to afford PTPQ2T.
 Scheme 2  Synthesis of the TPQ-based polymer. 
Both polymers were soluble in hot chlorinated benzenes. The number average (Mn) and weight average molecular weight (Mw), which were determined using the gel permeation chromatography at 140 °C, were as follows: Mn = 21.6 kDa, Mw = 105.0 kDa for PIQP2T and Mn = 28.0 kDa, Mw = 98.1 kDa for PTPQ2T (Table 1). The relatively large polydispersity index for both the polymers is likely due to the relatively low solubility originating in the strong aggregation, which often seen in D–A semiconducting polymers.37,38

Electronic structures
UV-vis absorption spectra of 7, 12, PIQP2T, and PTPQ2T in the solution are shown in Fig. 4a. While 7 afforded absorption maxima (λmax) at 387 nm and 407 nm, 12 afforded at 407 nm and 430 nm. This red-shift in 12 can be attributed to the enhanced coplanarity as compared to 7, which arise from the difference of the geometry between benzene and thiophene. The optical band gap (Eg) calculated with the absorption edge (λedge), was 2.95 eV and 2.81 eV for 7 and 12, respectively. In the polymer solution, PIQP2T provided a spectrum with λmax at 490 nm and 517 nm. As similar to the monomer system, PTPQ2T provided a red shifted spectrum as compared to PIQP2T, with the λmax at 530 nm and 565 nm. In the polymer thin film, both polymers provided λmax similar to that in solution. λedge was estimated to be 550 nm and 613 nm for PIQP2T and PTPQ2T, which corresponds to Eg of 2.25 eV and 2.02 eV, respectively (Table 1).

(b) Cyclic voltammograms. 7 and 12 were measured in benzonitril solution, and PIQP2T and PTPQ2T were measured in thin film. (c) HOMO and LUMO geometries calculated by the DFT method at the B3LYP/6-31 g (d) level. 
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to evaluate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level (EHOMO) of the materials (Fig. 4b). While the measurement of 7 and 12 was carried out in the solution, the measurement of PIQP2T and PTPQ2T was carried out in the thin film. The onset oxidation potentials of 7 and 12 against Ag/AgCl were 1.34 V and 1.38 V, which correspond to EHOMOs of −5.70 eV and −5.74 eV, respectively. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level (ELUMO), estimated by the addition of Eg to EHOMO, were −2.75 eV and −2.93 eV for 7 and 12, respectively. This means that TPQ has relatively higher electron affinity than IQP, and the difference in Eg mostly arise from the difference in ELUMO. The onset oxidation potentials of PIQP2T and PTPQ2T were 1.02 V and 1.07 V, with which EHOMOs were determined to be −5.38 eV and −5.43 eV, respectively. ELUMOs of PIQP2T and PTPQ2T were estimated to be −3.13 eV and −3.41 eV, respectively. As a result, in these systems, EHOMO and ELUMO shifted upward and downward, respectively, by the polymerization (extension of π-conjugation along the backbone), which is similar to the case in TPD and thiazolothiazole polymer systems.39 With such variation of the EHOMO and ELUMO between the monomers and polymers and the fact that the EHOMO and ELUMO were not so shallow and deep, respectively, the IQP and TPQ units can be regarded as “electron-neutral” building units.35 Such perturbation of EHOMO and ELUMO probably due to the fact that both HOMOs and LUMOs are well-delocalized along the backbone (Fig. 4c).
OFET properties
OFET devices with PIQP2T and PTPQ2T were fabricated and evaluated by using a bottom gate top contact architecture. 1H,1H,2H,2H-Perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane (FDTS) was used as the self-assembled monolayer (SAM) on top of the SiO2/Si substrate, on which the polymer solution in o-dichlorobenzene (DCB) was spun and then the resulting thin films were annealed at 150 °C for 30 minutes. Both polymers demonstrated p-channel behavior. Fig. 5 shows the typical transfer and output curves of the OFETs, in which the transfer characteristics were obtained with the drain voltage (VD) of −60 V. Although the output curves showed a slight non-linear behavior at the low VD region, they gave fairly good saturation behavior at the higher VD region. The hole mobilities extracted from the saturation region were similar for both polymers. The highest hole mobility was 0.037 and 0.027 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PIQP2T and PTPQ2T, respectively, and the current on/off ratios were as high as 106 (Table 2).

OPV properties
OPV cells were fabricated using an inverted architecture with ZnO as the electron transport layer and MoO3 as the hole transport layer. The polymer/[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) solution in DCB with 3 volume% of 1,8-diodooctane (DIO) was spin-coated to form bulk heterojunction thin films. Fig. 6 displays the external quantum efficiency spectra and current density–voltage curves of the devices. The photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. Both the PIQP2T and PTPQ2T-based cells showed the photoresponse up to slightly longer wavelength region than λedge of the polymer absorption spectra. Whereas λedge for PIQP2T and PTPQ2T was 550 nm and 613 nm, respectively, as described above, the photoresponse reaches over 700 nm for both the cells (Fig. 6a). The photoresponse at longer wavelength region such as 550–700 nm likely comes from PC61BM. The EQE was around 40–45% at the region of λmax for both the cells, which reflect the modest short-circuit currents (JSCs) (Fig. 6b, Table 2). Again, similar power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) such as 2.3% (PIQP2T) and 2.7% (PTPQ2T) were obtained for these polymer cells. It should be noted that although the overall PCEs were not so high, fairly high VOCs of 0.94 V was obtained for both cells. This is consistent with the relatively deep EHOMO of the polymers. The relatively wide band gap and the very high VOC could be advantageous for the use as the front cell in tandem architecture.40,41

Thin film structure and morphology
The ordering structure of the polymers and polymer/PC71BM blend films were investigated by the grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) measurements. Fig. 7a and c displays the two-dimensional (2D) GIXD patterns of the polymer neat film for PIQP2T and PTPQ2T, respectively. Both the polymers gave diffractions corresponding to the lamellar structure and the π–π stacking structure along the qz and qxy axes, respectively, indicating the edge-on orientation (Fig. 7a and c). Fig. 7e and f shows the cross sectional profiles of the patterns along the qz and qxy axes, respectively. It is interesting to note that the π–π stacking peaks of both PIQP2T and PTPQ2T appeared at qxy = 1.71 Å−1 (indicated by arrows), which corresponds to a distance of ca. 3.7 Å. In general, thiophene–thiophene linkage (TPQ–thiophene) provide smaller dihedral angle than benzene-thiophene linkage (IQP–thiophene), and thus is expected to give better ordering structure. However, it was found that the ordering structures of PIQP2T and PTPQ2T were fairly similar. This is probably as a result of strong intermolecular interaction originating in the amide moiety having a local dipole, which reduces the difference of the steric effect. These results agree well with the charge transport property observed in OFETs. In the blend film (Fig. 7b and d), both PIQP2T and PTPQ2T gave similar patterns to the neat film, i.e., the backbone orientation was preserved. The π–π stacking distance was also almost the same as in the neat film. The unfavorable orientation for OPV devices seen in the blend film could be one of the limiting factors for the OPV performance. Nevertheless, further modification of the molecular structure can realize the favorable face-on orientation, which possibly enhances the OPV performance.

Conclusion
We have synthesized new semiconducting polymers (PIQP2T and PTPQ2T) based on amide-bridged terphenyl (IQP) and dithienylbenzene (TPQ) building units. These polymers had relatively wide band gap of >2.0 eV with deep EHOMOs of −5.4 eV. EHOMO and ELUMO similarly shifted upward and downward, respectively, by the π-extension from the monomer unit to the polymer, which can be ascribed to the delocalized HOMO and LUMO along the frameworks. These results imply that IQP and TPQ can be viewed as electron-neutral building units.35 The polymers presented here exhibited similar hole mobilities of 0.03–0.04 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the OFET devices. Although the PCEs were modest, the OPV devices based on these polymers showed quite high VOC of 0.94 V, which reflects deep EHOMOs of −5.4 eV. Interestingly, both polymers had similar ordering structures in the thin film despite that the IQP is likely to be more sterically hindered at the end of the moiety than TPQ. This is probably due to the strong intermolecular interactions originating in the amide group. With these aspects, IQP and TPQ can be useful π-building units for semiconducting polymers.
Experimental section
Synthesis
All chemicals and solvents are of reagent grade unless otherwise indicated. THF, toluene, cyclohexane, and DMF were purified by a Glass Contour Solvent System (Nikko Hansen & Co., Ltd.) prior to use. 1 was synthesized according to the literature procedure.42 Polymerization was carried out with a microwave reactor (Biotage Initiator). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained in deuterated chloroform and DCB with TMS as internal reference by using a JNM-ECS400 (JEOL RESONANCE). Molecular weights were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) by calibrating with polystyrene standards using a TOSOH HLC-8121GPC/HT at 140 °C with DCB as the solvent.

Instrumentation
Cyclic voltammograms were recorded on a ALS Electrochemical Analyzer Model 612D with the three electrode system consisting of a platinum disc working electrode (φ = 3 mm), a platinum wire counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode in a acetonitrile containing tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. Polymer thin films were cast from DCB solutions on the working electrode. All the potentials were calibrated with the half-wave potential of the ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple measured under identical condition. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometer. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis was carried out with an EXSTAR DSC7020 (SII Nanotechnology, Inc.) at a cooling and heating rate of 10 °C min−1. 2D GIXD experiments were conducted at SPring-8 on beamline BL19B2. The samples were irradiated with an X-ray energy of 12.39 keV (λ = 1 Å) at a fixed incident angle of 0.12° through a Huber diffractometer, and the GIXD patterns were recorded on a 2D image detector (Pilatus 300K). The polymer thin films for the GIXD measurement were prepared under the same condition used for the OFET and OPV fabrication as described below. AFM images were obtained with Nanocute scanning probe microscope system (SII Nanotechnology, Inc.).
Fabrication and characterization of OFET devices
OFET devices were fabricated in a bottom-gate-top-contact configuration on a heavily doped n+-Si(100) wafer with 200 nm-thickness thermally grown SiO2 (Ci = 17.3 nF cm−2). The Si/SiO2 substrates were ultrasonicated with water for three min thrice, and acetone and isopropanol for 5 min, respectively, and rinsed in boiled isopropanol for 10 min, and then were subjected to UV-ozone treatment for 30 min. The cleaned substrates were then treated by FDTS as follows. The substrates were left in a Teflon container with several drops of FDTS and then the container was heated to 120 °C for 2 h in the desiccator. The FDTS-treated substrates were ultrasonicated with acetone and isopropanol for 5 min, respectively, and rinsed in boiled isopropanol for 10 min. Polymer thin films were spin-coated from hot DCB solutions (3 g L−1) at 1000 rpm for 10 s and then 2500 rpm for 35 s. The polymer films were annealed at 150 °C for 30 min under nitrogen. On top of the polymer thin films, gold drain and source contact electrodes (thickness: 80 nm) with the channel length and width of 40 μm and 1500 μm, respectively, were deposited using a vacuum evaporator. Current–voltage characteristics of the OFET devices were measured at room temperature under ambient conditions (relative humidity: 30–40%) with a Keithley 4200-SCS semiconductor parameter analyzer. Threshold voltages of the devices were estimated from the transfer plots by extrapolating the square root of the drain current to the horizontal axis. The field-effect mobilities were extracted from the square root of the drain current in the saturation regime (VD (source–drain current) = −60 V) by using the following equation,ID =(WCi/2L)μ(VG − VT)2where L and W are channel length and width, respectively, Ci is the capacitance of the SiO2 gate dielectric, ID is the source–drain current, and VG, and VT are the gate, and threshold voltages, respectively. The mobilities and threshold voltages were obtained over more than 10 devices.
Fabrication and characterization of OPV devices
ITO substrates were pre-cleaned sequentially by sonicating in a detergent bath, de-ionized water, acetone, and isopropanol at rt, and in a boiled isopropanol bath, each for 10 min. Then, the substrates were subjected to UV/ozone treatment at rt for 20 min. The ITO substrates masked at the electrical contacts were coated with ZnO precursor by spin coating (3000 rpm for 30 s) a precursor solution prepared by dissolving zinc acetate dehydrate (0.5 g) and ethanolamine (0.14 mL) in 5 mL of 2-methoxyethanol. They were then baked in air at 200 °C for 30 min, then rinsed with acetone and isopropanol, and dried in a glove box. The active layer was deposited in a glove box by spin coating hot (100 °C) DCB solution containing the polymer and PC71BM with the weight ratio of 1:2 at 600 rpm for 20 s. MoOx (7.5 nm) and Ag (100 nm) were deposited sequentially by thermal evaporation under ∼10−5 Pa, where the active area of the cells was 0.16 cm2. J–V characteristics of the devices were measured with a Keithley 2400 source measure unit in nitrogen atmosphere under 1 Sun (AM1.5G) conditions using a solar simulator (SAN-EI Electric, XES-40S1, 1000 W m−2). The light intensity for the J–V measurements was calibrated with a reference PV cell (Konica Minolta AK-100 certified by the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Japan). More than 10 devices were analysed. EQE spectra were measured with a Spectral Response Measuring System (Soma Optics, Ltd., S-9241).
