    , Accepted 14th December 2017First published on 14th December 2017AbstractThe splitting of water into molecular hydrogen and oxygen with the use of renewable solar energy is considered one of the most promising routes to yield sustainable fuel. Herein, we report the H2 evolution performance of gallium doped TiO2 photocatalysts with varying degrees of Ga dopant. The gallium(III) ions induced significant changes in the structural, textural and electronic properties of TiO2 nanoparticles, resulting in remarkably enhanced photocatalytic activity and good stability for H2 production. Ga3+ ions can act as hole traps that enable a large number of excited electrons to migrate towards the TiO2 surface, thereby facilitating electron transfer and charge separation. Additionally, the cationic dopant and its induced defects might introduce a mid-gap state, promoting electron migration and prolonging the lifetime of charge carrier pairs. We have discovered that the optimal Ga dopant concentration was 3.125 at% and that the incorporation of platinum (0.5 wt%) as a co-catalyst further improved the H2 evolution rate up to 5722 μmol g−1 h−1. Pt not only acts as an electron sink, drastically increasing the electron/hole pair lifetime, but it also creates an intimate contact at the heterojunction between Pt and Ga-TiO2, thus improving the interfacial electron transfer process. These catalyst design strategies provide new ways of designing transition metal photocatalysts that improve green fuel production from renewable solar energy and water.
Introduction
Photocatalytic water splitting using semiconductor particles is one of the most promising routes to produce clean hydrogen fuel using renewable solar energy.1–4 Although considerable progress has been made using highly active TiO2 photocatalysts, it is still challenging to achieve efficient catalytic activity either by retarding the recombination of electron–hole pairs upon photoexcitation or to improve responsiveness to visible light absorption because of their large intrinsic band gaps.1–4 In most cases, it is necessary to load a co-catalyst (i.e. Pt) onto the TiO2 surface not only to enhance the electron mobility and transfer, thus increasing the separation of charge carriers, but also to provide active sites for redox reactions.1–4
Doping foreign elements into the TiO2 host is one of the most effective approaches to facilitate charge carrier separation by altering its electronic and chemical structure, leading to a better apparent quantum efficiency.1–4 Cationic doping with transition metals, i.e. Cu, Fe, Ni, Ce, Al, Mn, Ga, Ru, etc., has been extensively reported to enhance the performance.4–12 However, it is worth noting that doping does not always introduce favourable effects, for instance, the defects induced by excess dopant might work as the recombination centers of photo-excited electrons and holes, thus diminishing the quantum efficiency. The fundamental understanding of doping effects, in terms of structural changes, is essential to take advantage of the resulting phenomena and ascertain the optimal doping concentration. For instance, recently, Al-She’irey et al.13 reported that doping Ga into the (001)-faceted TiO2 microtablet significantly enhanced the interfacial interactions between TiO2 and the perovskite layer, and the carrier transport in the solar cell device, leading to 2.46% improved power conversion efficiency.
In this work, we report the doping of earth-abundant and inexpensive gallium species into TiO2 nanoparticles with various gallium concentrations using a combined co-precipitation method. The influence of Ga dopants on the photocatalytic H2 production from water with and without a Pt co-catalyst was systematically investigated. We discuss the correlation between the altered physicochemical–electronic properties and superior light activity achieved by Ga doping.
Experimental
Synthesis of Ga-doped TiO2 nanoparticles
All reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used without further purification. In a typical procedure, titanium(IV) isopropoxide (Ti-(OC3H7)4) and 50 mL of isopropanol (IPA) were vigorously mixed at room temperature (solution A). Solution B was prepared by dissolving a desirable amount of gallium(III) nitrate hydrate (Ga(NO3)3·xH2O) in 25 mL of IPA and 0.86 mL of deionized water. Solution B was sequentially added to solution A, followed by slowly adding 4.8 mL of ammonia solution (NH4OH, 28%) using a syringe pump (1 mL min−1). The mixture was kept stirring at room temperature for 16 h, and evaporated at 80 °C until free dry powder was obtained. The as-synthesized product was subsequently calcined in air at 500 °C for 2 h and denoted as ‘xGaTi’ where x is the nominal Ga doping concentration, x = 1.56, 3.125, 6.25 and 12.5 at%. The undoped TiO2 was also prepared by the same method without a gallium precursor in solution B.
The loading of a Pt co-catalyst (0.5 wt%) on to the Ga-doped TiO2 was performed by the wetness impregnation method. 8.5 mL of aqueous chloroplatinic acid solution (H2PtCl6·6H2O, 0.3 mM) was slowly added to a mixture of 0.1 g of xGaTi and 20 mL of deionized water at 85 °C with vigorous stirring. After the mixture was completely evaporated, the powder was dried for 2 h and annealed at 500 °C in air for 3 h. The Pt-impregnated sample was labelled as ‘Pt/xGaTi’.
Characterization
Synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected at beamline 17-BM-B (λ = 0.72768 Å) of the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory. Powder samples were loaded into a 1.0 mm-diameter Kapton capillary, and two-dimensional diffraction patterns were collected by a Perkin Elmer amorphous silicon detector. Data acquisition was performed with QXRD, and the phase fraction, mean crystallite size, and lattice constants were subsequently determined by Rietveld refinement using the GSAS-II program.14
X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) were obtained at beamline 23-ID-2 (CSX-2) of the National Source Light Source II at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). Powder samples were mounted on Al foil and loaded into the analysis chamber. The XAS measurements are collected using the total electron yield (TEY) detection mode to provide sensitive chemical state information relevant to the Ga L-edge, the Ti L-edge and the O K-edge. All the spectra were normalized and analysed using the Athena module of the IFEFFIT package. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and the total pore volume were determined by N2 sorption measurements conducted on a Micromeritics ASAP2020 apparatus at −196 °C. The samples were degassed at 150 °C for 6 h prior to analysis.
Other characterization techniques were performed at the Center for Functional Nanomaterials at BNL. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images were obtained using a Hitachi HD2700C at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. STEM energy X-ray dispersive spectroscopy (STEM-EDS) mapping was recorded by a Bruker Nano GmbH detector. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a RHK-XPS/STM/AFM system using Mg Kα as the source and a hemispherical analyser (PHOIBOS HSA-3500 100). Survey spectra were recorded at a pass energy of 50 eV, whereas core-level spectra were measured at a pass energy of 20 eV. All the binding energies were calibrated to the surface adventitious hydrocarbon feature (C 1s) at 284.6 eV. Raman spectra were recorded on a WITec Alpha combination microscope with a 532 nm laser as the excitation source. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance (UV-Vis-DRS) measurements were performed on a PerkinElmer Lambda 950 spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere assembly.
Photocatalytic water splitting measurements
Photocatalytic water splitting activity was evaluated through the hydrogen evolution reaction (half-reaction) in a closed gas circulation and evacuation system. 3 mg of the powder catalyst was suspended in 3 mL of aqueous methanol solution (20 vol%) in a 6 mL sealed quartz cell. The reaction temperature was maintained at 293 K by continuous water circulation. After evacuation and Ar purging several times to remove the dissolved oxygen in the solution ensuring anaerobic conditions, the reactor was side-irradiated by a 150 W xenon arc lamp from Optical Building Blocks Corporation equipped with an aqueous CuSO4 filter (310 nm < λ < 625 nm) under magnetic stirring. The evolved gases were determined by gas chromatography (GC Agilent 6890N) equipped with FID/TCD detectors and a methanizer using Ar as the carrier gas.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1A shows a HAADF-STEM micrograph of 3.125 at% Ga-doped TiO2 nanoparticles in which the mean particle size is in the range of 6–10 nm. The Ga-doped TiO2 nanoparticles are well crystallized with lattice fringes of 0.35 nm corresponding to the (101) plane of anatase TiO2. The smooth surface without contrast difference implies the absence of free or unbound excess gallium oxide. No obvious contraction or expansion of the d-spacing upon doping was found by electron microscopy. The effective ionic radius of Ti(IV) is 60.5 pm in the six coordination sites of the anatase structure, whereas those for Ga(III) are 47 and 62 pm in the 4- and 6-coordinate sites, respectively.15 However, the Pauling ionic radii of Ti4+ and Ga3+ are 68 and 62 pm.16 Such a comparable ionic radius may be favourable for the substitutional doping of Ga ions into the TiO2 matrix. Among the five crystalline modifications of gallium oxide (α, β, γ, δ, and ε), monoclinic β-Ga2O3 is the most stable crystalline form in which Ga ions are in distorted tetrahedral (corner sharing) and octahedral sites (edge sharing).17–20 β-Ga2O3 could be obtained from other forms of Ga2O3 by annealing above 1000 °C17 or from heat treatment of gallium nitrate at >650 °C.20,21 Considering the post-treatment at 500 °C in air of our catalysts, the possible crystal phases are δ- and ε-Ga2O3, which were reported to be present upon lower temperature calcination.17,21 δ-Ga2O3 is a body-centered cubic metastable structure while ε-Ga2O3 is orthorhombic with an obvious lower symmetry than a hexagonal or tetragonal structure.17,21,22 Herein, no fingerprints of any of the five crystalline modifications of gallium oxide were observed in the STEM images. The elemental maps shown in Fig. 1B display the homogeneous distribution of Ga and Ti where the scarcity of Ga was recorded besides the enrichment of Ti signals.

Fig. 2A and B show the representative HAADF-STEM images of Pt loaded on the 3.125 at% Ga-doped TiO2 nanoparticles. The contrast difference indicates the existence of small Pt nanoparticles dispersed on the surface or surrounding Ga-doped TiO2. The particle size of Pt varies from 0.5 to 4 nm. With more detailed mapping at different sites in Fig. 2C, the gallium signals were well dispersed through the whole region of TiO2 and no separated surface Ga species were found. Compared to the Pt signals that were evenly distributed on the TiO2 surface, the Ga signal was stronger in the thicker, agglomerated areas with more concentrated Ti. Therefore, Ga was expected to be located inside the lattice of TiO2, at least partially, meanwhile either an amorphous phase or ultra-small gallium oxide clusters on the surface could not be ruled out by electron microscopy.

Fig. 3A shows the XRD patterns of the undoped and doped TiO2 with different Ga dosages. The diffraction peaks at 2θ = 11.9, 17.6, 22.2, 24.8, 25.2 and 28.5° for all samples match well with the TiO2 anatase phase (I41/amd space group). This is in good agreement with the electron microscopy results. A very small fraction of rutile TiO2 is detected at 12.9° in pure TiO2 and disappeared upon gallium introduction, implying that gallium doping suppresses rutile growth. No noticeable diffraction peak representative of gallium oxide appears, i.e. cubic δ-Ga2O3 and γ-Ga2O3, monoclinic β-Ga2O3, or orthorhombic ε-Ga2O3, which can be attributed to the complete substitution of Ga3+ ions into the TiO2 framework, nor a very low concentration of gallium dopant or highly dispersed ultra-small gallium oxide clusters. As mentioned earlier, the comparable ionic radii between Ga3+ and Ti4+ might result in the substitution of Ga3+ ions into the TiO2 lattice along with interstitial sites. Chandiran et al.7 suggested that the trivalent Ga cation could be positioned as a substituent of Ti4+ sites entailing the formation of oxygen vacancies at a Ga dosage of 2%. It is worth noting that the (101), (004), (200), (105) and (211) peaks are less intense along with a slightly wider peak width with increasing Ga doping to 6.25 at%, indicating a decrease in the crystallite size. It should be noted that the XRD peak shift and broadening can be attributed to the particle size-broadening effect and/or strain-broadening effect.23 As seen in Table 1 and Fig. S1 (ESI†), the lattice parameters of anatase TiO2 from Rietveld refinement slightly reduce in the presence of Ga up to 6.25 at% and then increase in the 12GaTi sample. This is consistent with the small shifts of the enlarged (101) peaks (as shown in the inset) toward higher 2θ values on 3.125GaTi, 6.25GaTi and 12.5GaTi. Accordingly, the average crystallite size decreases from 14.1 to 7.8 nm and becomes larger in the Ga-rich sample (9.1 nm). Indeed, the decrease of the crystallite size can be attributed to the doping effect that was widely reported in metal-doped TiO2 systems.6,7 Otherwise, the lattice constant c was found to decrease with increasing Ga concentrations from 1.56 to 6.25 at% as a consequence of the surface tension. Such a lattice shrinkage here could be caused by Ga3+ substitution with relatively smaller radius replacing Ti4+, resulting in the distortion and contraction of the lattice constant. The slight decrease in the tetragonality (c/a ratio) of anatase and cell volume implies the local distortion upon doping Ga into TiO2. As the Ga dosage was further increased to 12.5 at%, such substitutional incorporation was saturated and more free, ultra-small gallium oxide clusters tend to form on the TiO2 surface that could not be detected by XRD. No change is observed in the crystal structure of doped TiO2 after Pt deposition as shown in the XRD patterns in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The lack of metallic Pt peaks indicates the good dispersion of very small Pt particles.

The reduction in crystallite size seems to be in good agreement with the gradual increase in the BET surface area, which is reported in Table 1. The adsorption/desorption isotherms in Fig. 3B are of type IV, which is characteristic of mesoporous materials according to the IUPAC classification.24 The isotherms have a well-defined hysteresis loop in the intermediate shape among types H2, H3 and H4 due capillary condensation associated with aggregated particles having micropore filling. Doping gallium into TiO2 results in better mesoporosity involving larger surface areas (86–176 m2 g−1) and total pore volumes (0.28–0.69 cm3 g−1) in comparison with the undoped samples (45 m2 g−1 and 0.17 cm3 g−1). The largest surface area for 12.5GaTi (∼176 m2 g−1) might be due to the formation of free ultra-small Ga2O3 nanoparticles that are aggregated on the TiO2 surface.6,11
The Raman spectra of all samples in Fig. 3C reveal five Raman-active modes at 152, 204, 646 (Eg), 405 (B1g), and 523 cm−1 (A1g + B1g), which are indicative of an anatase phase, hence corroborating the STEM and XRD results. No molecular vibration for the Ga-related species is tracked, i.e. 15 active modes for β-Ga2O3.18 However, the most intense mode, Eg, which is associated with the O–Ti–O bending vibration, blue-shifts from 152 to 155 cm−1 with increasing Ga dopant concentration (see in the inset). The shift towards a higher frequency might be caused by the shorter bond length of O–Ti due to gallium incorporation, which is in good agreement with the diffraction results. It was also reported that the blueshift in phonon frequencies is due to the size confinement effect, whereas the presence of impurities and defects causes the redshift.18 So, combined with XRD data, such a small blueshift herein is ascribed to the strain effect upon doping.

Fig. 3D shows the UV-Vis-DRS spectra of blank TiO2 and the doped materials. The absorption edge of the undoped TiO2 is located at ∼400 nm, corresponding to a band gap energy of 3.15 eV. Gallium doping strongly blue-shifts the onset toward lower wavelengths meanwhile the absorption in the range of 200–380 nm representative of the O 2p (valence band, VB) and – Ti 3d (conduction band, CB) hybridization is clearly enhanced compared to TiO2. This demonstrates the less pronounced localization of 3d states or the effect of weaker hybridization between Ti 3d and Ga 3d in the presence of Ga ions and therefore wider 3d bands. Similar phenomena were reported by Chandiran et al. and Al-She’irey et al.7,13 where light absorption is less upon Ga doping. Gionco et al.10 theoretically and experimentally found that the substitution of six-coordinated Ti atoms in anatase TiO2 with Ga atoms induces the formation of a hole from the TiO2 VB that is strongly localized on the O 2p nonbonding orbital of a three-coordinated O atom. Such a superhyperfine interaction leads to a singly occupied α state at the VB maximum (VBM) and an empty β component in the middle of the gap.10 By using time-dependent density functional theory, Rahane et al.25 reported the strong dependency of calculated optical absorption spectra and their corresponding optical band gaps for bulk stoichiometry (Ga2O3)n clusters on cluster geometries and sizes. With increasing cluster size, the absorption peaks shifted toward higher energies and such a blue shift may be the outcome of bulk-like coordination.
The electronic structures of doped TiO2 were also identified by XPS analysis and Auger spectroscopy. The survey spectra of pure and doped TiO2 samples are shown in Fig. 4A. The presence of gallium was confirmed via Ga LMM, Ga 3s, Ga 3p and Ga 3d features besides O 1s and Ti 2p fingerprints. The intensity of those gallium features increases with doping. The high-resolution XPS spectra of Ti 2p core levels in Fig. 4B confirm the presence of Ti4+ states in terms of spin–orbital splitting of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 at 459.5 and 456.2 eV, respectively. Neither binding energy shifts in the Ti 2p doublets nor an emerging shoulder of a lower oxidation state of titanium species was detected upon Ga-doping or Pt addition. The broad Ga 3d core-level peaks of 3.125GaTi and 6.25GaTi in Fig. 4C include the O 2s and Ga 3d constituents. Apart from the O 2s peak at 22 eV, the Ga 3d peak at 20.3 eV corresponds to the Ga3+ ion in Ga2O3. A smaller peak at 19.2 eV might account for gallium suboxide at the surface.26 This is quite consistent with a small difference in the O 1s feature in Fig. 4E. The O 1s spectra are asymmetric, involving the main peak at 530.8 eV representative of lattice oxygen and the shoulder at higher binding energies (+1 to +1.5 eV), which is usually attributed to an oxygen vacancy defect, surface low-coordinated oxygen ion, surface hydroxyl groups and/or surface adsorbed-molecular water. It should be noticed that doping results in a more pronounced shoulder compared to pure TiO2, implying the possible formation of Ga–O–Ga and/or Ga–O–Ti bonds, more defects or under-coordinated oxygen species. Despite the presence of tetragonal or octahedral Ga3+ sites, the bond lengths of Ga–O and Ti–O are very close (±0.2 eV difference), so the lattice oxygen in the O 1s spectra herein is defined as metal–oxygen bonds including Ti–O–Ti, Ga–O–Ti, Ga–O–Ti and/or Ga-suboxide. It is worth noting that the incorporation of Ga into TiO2 strongly affects the chemical environment. The Ga LMM Auger spectra of 12GaTi with and without Pt in Fig. 4D are consistent with the Ga LMM from Ga2O3 in the literature with the predominant feature at ∼1062 eV, while the reduced Ga species should display a peak at a higher kinetic energy (for instance, metallic Ga at ∼1069 eV). The Ga dopants, indeed, are mainly in a trivalent state although minor intermediate GaOx might exist as the feature could be hidden in the Ga(III) LMM spectra.27 No noticeable difference in both Ti 2p and Ga LMM spectra of the Pt-loaded 12.5GaTi sample reveals the negligible effect of the Pt co-catalyst on the electronic properties of the Ga-doped TiO2.

X-ray absorption spectroscopy was employed to further characterize the electronic structure of the Ga-doped TiO2 series.
The Ti L2,3-edge of the 1.56GaTi sample in Fig. 5A shows a classic, strong and sharp feature in the range of 455–470 eV of anatase Ti(IV)O2, which is assigned to excitations of the Ti 2p states into the empty Ti 3d states.28,29 The L3-edge (2p3/2 levels or 2p3/2 → 3d4s transition) and the L2-edge (2p1/2 level or 2p1/2 → 3d4s transition) split into two sub-bands associated with t2g and eg states via hybridization. The asymmetry of the L3–eg doublet is the fingerprint of the crystallographic phases that is ascribed to a noncubic ligand field effect related to the distortion of the [TiO6] octahedral environment.30,31 Two weak, low-intensity pre-edge features reflecting 2p6d0 → 2p5d1 transitions for Ti4+ in the Oh symmetry arising from particle–hole coupling in an octahedral crystal field30,31 are found. As the gallium concentration increases to 12.5%, the line shape remains like pure anatase TiO2, indicating no obvious phase transformation. Nevertheless, with increasing dopant concentration, two pre-peaks disappear, the L2-edge starts to broaden, and the L3–eg peak shows a noticeable flattening trend. The relative intensity ratio of the (a/b) peaks in the symmetric L3–eg doublet decreases, reflecting the changes in long-range bonding (band structure) properties or electronic structures on a length scale of 1 nm due to Ga incorporation into the anatase lattice.30,31 The broadening of the L2-edge originates from the shorter lifetime of the 2p1/2 state30 or from the band formation and/or much weaker excitonic effect for the more strongly hybridized eg orbitals.30 It should be noted again that the addition of Pt herein does not significantly alter the electronic structure of the Ga-doped TiO2 sample.

Fig. 5B displays the Ga L-edge of the bulk Ga2O3 reference, Ga-doped TiO2 with 6.25 and 12.5% Ga, and Pt-loaded samples. No signals of Ga were detected on the low dopant concentration materials (not shown here). The main distinguishable peak positions of doped TiO2 are like the Ga2O3 standard, confirming the trivalent oxidation state of tetrahedral gallium. It is worth noting that the small features in the 1115–1130 eV region are very different from the reference. Since Ga2O3 has various crystal modifications, the comprehensive interpretation of the Ga L-edge with respect to different crystal structures is lacking in the literature. Shimizu et al.22,32 compared the Ga L3-edge spectra of various Ga2O3 materials and claimed that the second feature (marked by an arrow) arising from the 2p → 4d transition was related to low coordinated Ga with a specific local structure. This is consistent with our previous hypothesis that the amount of Ga incorporation into the anatase TiO2 lattice is limited. As the Ga concentration increases beyond 6.25 at%, the Ga species disperse on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles in the form of ultra-small clusters with low coordination.
Photocatalytic H2 production using Ga-doped TiO2 photocatalysts without a Pt co-catalyst is displayed in Fig. 6A, in which these materials demonstrate that they are active for H2 evolution. The time profiles in Fig. S3 (ESI†) show that a constant amount of H2 is generated during 5 h of UV-visible light exposure (λ = 310–625 nm). Doping with Ga significantly improves the photocatalytic performance of TiO2 and 3.125 at% Ga dopant is the optimal concentration, producing ∼360 μmol g−1 of H2 per hour. Beyond this doping amount, the rate gradually diminishes to 285 and 41 μmol g−1 h−1, leading to much worse performance than that over pure TiO2 despite a much larger surface area. It was reported previously that excess dopant concentrations lead to reduced activity due to (i) the coverage of free oxide aggregates that might hinder light absorption, penetration and photoactivation, and (ii) the formation of recombination centers that might trap more electrons, neutralize the holes and thus increase the recombination opportunity.1–5,7–9,11,12 Moreover, gallium(III) ions can play the role of hole traps, thus enabling a large amount of excited electrons to migrate towards the surface of TiO2. This efficiently facilitates electron transfer and charge separation, hence improving the photocatalytic activity. Ga dopants and induced defects possibly introduce the mid-gap state located between the VBM and CBM of TiO2, resulting in better charge transport, particularly electron migration, and the longer lifetime of electron/hole pairs. Chandiran et al.7 experimentally demonstrated that Ga3+ prolonged the electron lifetime, enhanced the charge carrier collection efficiency, but did not influence the energy distribution of the trap states below the CB or induce an upward shift of the CB edge. Gionco et al.10 proved that the Ga dopant ions stabilize the hole trapping centers and as a consequence, the generation of electron–hole pairs under illumination results in the preferential formation of localized polaronic holes near the dopant, reducing the mobility of these charge carriers.

With the deposition of a 0.5 wt% noble metal co-catalyst, the activities significantly increase. Fig. 6B shows the dependence of the H2 evolution rate on the Ga-doping dosage in which the rate of H2 production reaches a maximum, ∼5722 μmol g−1 h−1, at 3.125 at% of gallium dopant. Similar to the non-co-catalyst case, excess doping content is detrimental to the photoactivity, which is consistent with the reports in the literature.1–6,8,9 The remarkable enhancement in the H2 evolution rate in the presence of Pt nanoparticles, typically 10–15 times higher (shown in Fig. S4A, ESI†), can be explained by the effective trapping of excited electrons from the CB of the doped TiO2 system to Pt, thereby quenching the recombination of the excited electrons and holes. It is well known that Pt is indeed a very efficient catalyst for proton reduction to H2.1–4 The Pt co-catalyst enhances the interfacial electron transfer process in three ways: (1) intimate contact at the Pt/semiconductor heterojunction, (2) due to its larger work function, acts as an electron sink, i.e. drastically prolonging the lifetime of charge carriers and (3) creates a space charge layer.1–4 The transient photocurrent responses during 10 light on/off cycles in Fig. S4B (ESI†) indicate a much larger current density of Pt/6.25GaTi compared to Pt/1.56GaTi and Pt/TiO2. Without the Ga dopant, Pt/TiO2 exhibits a much worse on/off signal. It demonstrates the largest number of photoexcited electrons and the longest lifetime of charge carriers upon 6.25% Ga doping.
The more effective the charge separation, the more efficiently the electrons at the CB are able to reduce H+ to H2 upon light irradiation. The photoresponse also indicates the synergistic effect between the Ga dopant and Pt nanoparticles. Joo et al.33 experimentally demonstrated the alternative function of Pt to facilitate the recombination of atomic hydrogen that was not observed on carbon–TiO2 catalysts. However, as reported in the literature, the optimal Pt loading amount should be 0.5–1 wt% since excessive Pt might form larger agglomerated particles and decrease the dispersity of Pt on the catalyst surface.
On the other hand, durability is another crucial factor to evaluate a photocatalyst besides its catalytic activity since deactivation or photo-corrosion easily occurs after a few hours of light irradiation. To further probe the stability of these materials, the two best photocatalysts, 3.125GaTi and Pt/3.125GaTi, were purged with Ar after a single run, evacuated overnight and their activity was re-measured under light irradiation without either photocatalyst washing or addition of fresh solution. As indicated in Fig. 7, the amount of H2 generation over both materials was quite stable after three consecutive cycles with each cycle of 5 h, demonstrating the robustness of our photocatalysts.

Conclusions
Efficient Ga-doped TiO2 photocatalysts with varying gallium concentrations were successfully developed. The optimal Ga doping dosage was 3.125 at%, and the addition of a Pt co-catalyst remarkably improved H2 evolution, producing 5722 μmol of H2 per gram of catalyst per hour. The presence of the gallium dopant caused significant photocatalytic activity and excellent durability for H2 production due to the role of the Ga3+ ions as hole traps that improve the electron transfer and charge separation. Moreover, the mid-gap state of the cationic dopant and its induced defects that might be formed led to better electron transport and longer lifetimes of the electron/hole pairs. It is anticipated that our findings may provide design principles for promising transition metal photocatalysts for green H2 fuel production from renewable solar energy and water.
