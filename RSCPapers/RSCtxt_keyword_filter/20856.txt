The recent advances in metal halide perovskite solar cells surprised the traditional photovoltaic community. A key advance was subsequently made by replacing liquid electrolytes with solid state HTMs like spiro-OMeTAD, which not only improve power conversion efficiency but also enhance the cell stability.

1. Introduction
Energy is the initial driving force for the advancement of human society. Especially, human society has made great progress due to massively exploiting fossil fuels as an energy resource. However, the increasing consumption of fossil fuels results in greenhouse gas production. To resolve this problem, there has recently been a trend towards the increased commercialization of various renewable energy sources and sustainable development. Among all the renewable energy technologies, the solar cell is the most promising technology owing to its pollution free and inexhaustible character. Different technologies in photovoltaics, such as silicon (Si) based solar cells, semiconductor (e.g., GaAs) based cells, thin-film (e.g., CdTe) solar cells, organic photovoltaics (OPV) and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), compete for the future market. Among them, Si solar cells have received great attention for their high power conversion efficiencies.1 However, they require high-purity silicon and skilled manufacturing techniques, which result in high costs, so the extensive use of Si solar cells has been limited.
On the other hand, DSSCs have been considered as an upcoming generation in photovoltaics due to their high efficiency, decorative and colorful nature, easy fabrication and low cost of production, since the pioneering work reported by M. Grätzel.2–16 In DSSCs, the device architecture comprises a photoanode, which is transparent with a thin nanoparticle film of a mesoporous large band gap semiconductor deposited on conductive glass. A monolayer of photosensitizer molecules is chemically grafted on the semiconductor with anchoring functionalities. An electrolyte containing a redox couple is placed between the photoelectrode and the cathode, typically comprised of platinum deposited onto conductive glass, to transfer the charges. The sensitizer undergoes transition from its ground state to its excited state upon light absorption. One electron is then injected from the photoexcited state of the sensitizer into the conduction band of the semiconductor. The photoinjected electrons percolate through the thin mesoscopic conductor film and are collected by the conducting substrate. They subsequently flow through the external circuit, performing useful work, and eventually arrive at the counter electrode. Simultaneously, the oxidized sensitizer generated after electron injection is reduced to its ground state by taking an electron from the redox species (generally iodide ions) in the electrolyte solution. The oxidized species diffuse into the counter electrode and receive the external circuit electrons to complete the circuit.
Enhancing the photovoltaic performances of DSSCs requires good compatibility and efficient engineering among all components in the device. Many research groups have focused on sensitizers, as they play a vital role in DSSCs. Generally, the ideal sensitizer should fulfill the various essential characteristics: (i) a broad absorption spectrum extending to the near IR region with higher molar extinction coefficient, (ii) chemical stability in its ground and oxidized states, (iii) an irreversible adsorption onto the surface of the semiconductor, (iv) HOMO–LUMO levels sufficient for efficient electron injection and for dye regeneration and (iv) a photo-thermal stability of the sensitizer high enough to ensure a long lifetime for the DSSCs.
Based on these properties, many researchers have designed and synthesized various photosensitizers, including metal complexes,17–21 porphyrins, phthalocyanines and metal free organic dyes22–25 for DSSC applications in the past few decades. In particular, ruthenium complexes possess superior photovoltaic performances compared to other metal complexes. However, several practical issues related to the presence of a liquid electrolyte, dye desorption and corrosive action of the iodide/iodine redox electrolyte couple, have held back the large-scale technological development of such devices. Recently, a new family of solution-processable semiconducting perovskite structured materials based on organoleadtrihalide compounds have been developed as light harvesters. Recently perovskite sensitized solar cells reached a power conversion efficiency of 20.1%, which was certified by National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).26
Many approaches have been made towards alternatives to electrolytes, which have resulted in the development of solid state DSSCs, using polymeric ionic gels, ionic liquids, molten salts, p-type inorganic semiconductors, organic hole transporting materials (HTMs) or solvent free polymer-composite electrolytes. The exploration of newer HTMs is essential for future PSSC development. It has been previously demonstrated that interfacial chemical interactions may play a significant role in determining efficiencies in solid state sensitized solar cells. Initially spiro-OMeTAD was used as a solid hole conductor in PSSCs, and has shown an efficiency of 4%.27 Although it has been demonstrated that spiro-OMeTAD is the most effective small molecule for PSSCs, the spiro-bifluorene core is relatively expensive due to its tedious synthesis and low hole mobility (10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), which resulted in high interfacial recombination losses.28 Thus, many research groups including our group have focused on replacing spiro-OMeTAD with alternative low-cost and high efficiency HTMs. In this review we summarize the recent advances in the molecular design and technological aspects of HTMs for applications in PSSCs.
The configuration of a PSSC device is shown in Fig. 1a. The device consists of five elements (from bottom to top): (1) a conducting glass substrate (fluorine-doped tin oxide, FTO); (2) a TiO2 dense film prepared by spray pyrolysis29 to avoid short circuits between the FTO substrate and the HTM layer; (3) a mesoporous TiO2 film anchored with dye molecules; (4) an HTM layer prepared by spin-coating or another technique; (5) a counter electrode (e.g., Au, Ag).
 Fig. 1  (a) Schematic diagram of a PSSC device and (b) schematic diagram of energy levels and electron transfer processes in a PSSC. 
Visible light is absorbed by the perovskite and forms electron–hole pairs in the material, which leads to the formation of the excitons after thermalization of the carriers. The charge separation occurs through two possible primary reactions: the injection of photogenerated electrons into titanium dioxide nanoparticles (eqn (1a)) and/or the injection of holes (eqn (2a)) into a hole transporting material (HTM). The electron or hole injection process occurs first or later; the role of electron injection and transport within the oxide mesoporous film (eqn (2b)) remains unclear. The key role of TiO2 in efficient PSSCs based on mesoporous films of this particular metal oxide has indeed not been established clearly. But there is evidence for electron injection from the mixed halide CH3NH3PbI2Cl into TiO2.30,31 Undesired reactions such as exciton elimination, leading to photoluminescence (eqn (3)) or to non-radiative recombination (eqn (4)), as well as recombination of the charge carriers at the three interfaces (eqn (5) to (7)) compete with the extraction of the photogenerated charges. The kinetics of these processes are thus expected to control the overall photovoltaic conversion efficiency to a large extent. The energy levels and electron transfer processes of a PSSC are shown in Fig. 1b.

2. Small molecules as hole transporting materials (HTMs)
2.1. Spiro type HTMs
Kim and co-workers achieved a high power conversion efficiency of 9.7% in a solid state mesoscopic heterojunction solar cell using (CH3NH3)PbI3 perovskite nanoparticles and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD, Fig. 2, HTM 1) as the light harvester and hole transporting layer, respectively. The femtosecond laser studies and photo-induced absorption measurements showed that the charge separation occurred via hole injection from the excited (CH3NH3)PbI3 nanoparticles to spiro-MeOTAD followed by electron transfer to the mesoscopic TiO2 film. The thermal studies revealed that the hole transporter improved the device stability compared to (CH3NH3)PbI3 sensitized liquid junction cells. The PSSC device with spiro-MeOTAD exhibits a large photocurrent (Jsc) of 17 mA cm−2, an open circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 0.888 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.62 and a resulting power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.7%, under the standard AM 1.5 sunlight illumination.32

Aiming to improve the efficiency of the solid-state solar cell with (CH3NH3)PbI3 perovskite as a light absorber and spiro-MeOTAD as a hole transporter, Seok et al. synthesized the three spiro-OMeTAD derivatives (HTM 1, HTM 2, and HTM 3, Fig. 3a), considering the effects of the OMe group depending on its position in the aromatic ring.33 The absorption spectra of these HTMs were recorded in chlorobenzene, with absorption maxima centered at 387, 387, 381 nm respectively. The optical band gap energy of the material, which was influenced by the absorption onset wavelength, helps in identifying the effect of the substitution position. The absorption onset wavelengths of HTM 1, HTM 2, and HTM 3 moved to shorter wavelength (423 nm, 413 nm, 409 nm respectively), which implies that these HTMs have high energy band gap energies compared to the state-of-art spiro-MeOTAD. The electronic and optical properties of spiro-OMeTAD were varied by changing the position of the two OMe groups in each of the quadrants. The solar cell using the ortho substituted derivative of spiro-OMeTAD (HTM 3) showed better performance compared to the para and meta substituted derivatives (HTM 1 and HTM 2), with a PCE of 16.7%.34
 Fig. 3  (a) Structures of HTM 1, HTM 2, HTM 3 and HTM 4, studied by Seok and Mhaisalkar and co-workers and (b) structures of the dopants FK102 and 269. 
Mhaisalkar and co-workers reported the swivel-cruciform 3,3′-bithiophene based HTM 4 (Fig. 3a), which has a favorable optimum highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level and low recombination rates for PSSCs. Swivel-cruciform thiophene based moieties showed better solubility for tuning the molecular properties by manipulating the pendant group.35 The UV-visible spectra of these HTMs were recorded in chlorobenzene solvent. These HTMs showed absorption bands at 302 and 397 nm, which are similar to spiro-OMeTAD. The PSSC devices with HTM 4 showed a PCE of 7.3%, and with the addition of the dopant tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine) cobalt(III) (FK102, Fig. 3b) they showed a PCE of 8.7%, which was further increased to 11.0% with the addition of the deeper dopant FK269 (Fig. 3b). The increase in the efficiency with FK269 is due to improvement in the photovoltaic parameters like Voc and FF compared to the well known spiro-OMeTAD (Jsc of 17.2 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.06 V, a fill factor of 62.5% and resulting PCE of 11.4%), which is confirmed by its lower HOMO level, transient photovoltage decay (TPV) and impedance spectroscopy (IS).36
To adjust the electronic properties of the hole conductor, Seok et al., reported three novel HTMs having N,N-di-methoxyphenyl amine-substituted pyrene (HTM 5, HTM 6, and HTM 7, Fig. 4) in place of the spirobifluorene core of spiro-OMeTAD. The UV-vis spectra were measured in chlorobenzene solvent, and the absorption maxima of these HTMs were centered at 420, 470 and 492 nm respectively. The electron donating effect of the methoxy groups in N,N-di-p-methoxy phenylamine, which is directly bonded to the pyrene moiety, increases the electron density. The enhanced electron density modifies the HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, and the gap between them leads to a high PCE of 12.4% (HTM 7). The HTM 5 exhibited a lower efficiency (3.3%), which is due to insufficient driving force for hole injection. The well known spiro-OMeTAD showed a PCE of 12.7% under similar fabrication conditions.37

2.2. Triphenyl based HTMs
The triphenylamine (TPA) having electron donating groups at the p-position of phenyl ring does not influence their energy levels strongly. Considering this X. Li et al., reported TPA based HTMs (HTM 8 and HTM 9, Fig. 5) with a butadiene π-conjugated system; the absorption maxima of these HTMs are centered in the visible region, at 451 and 471 nm respectively. The hole mobilities of the HTM 8 and HTM 9, which are 2.98 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.27 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 respectively, were measured by time-of-flight (TOF) transient hole current measurement. These two HTMs have suitable HOMO levels in comparison to CH3NH3PbI3. HTM 8 showed a higher PCE (11.63%) compared to HTM 9 (11.34%), due to the improvement in Voc. The Voc values of HTM 9 and spiro-OMeTAD are close, which is in agreement with their HOMO levels; the theoretical Voc is measured by the difference in the quasi-Fermi levels of the electrons in the titania and holes in the HTM. Under the same conditions a spiro-OMeTAD cell gave a PCE of 12.08% (Jsc 18.7 mA cm−2, a Voc of 936 mV, and FF of 0.69).38
 Fig. 5  Structures of HTM 8, HTM 9, HTM 10, HTM 11 and HTM 12, studied by X. Li and D. Li and co-workers. 
D. Li and co-workers developed the novel HTM 10, HTM 11 and HTM 12 (Fig. 5), with a linear π-conjugated structure, which is based on a diphenyl unit (DP) and a triphenyl amine unit linked with olefinic bonds. The absorption spectra were recorded in dilute tetrahydrofuran solution, where the absorption maxima were located at 423, 436 and 451 nm respectively, due to the π-orbital interaction of the TPA and olefinic bonds. The hole-drift mobilities of HTM 10, HTM 11 and HTM 12 are 1.09 × 10−4, 8.39 × 10−5 and 6.79 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with an electric field of 3.1 × 105 V cm−1, which indicates that the extension of the conjugated system could retard charge carrier transportation in an efficient manner.39 The propeller-like TPA located at the terminal end of the linear conjugated molecules can be expected to prevent close contact between the perovskite and the HTMs, which is favorable in reducing the electronic coupling, charge recombination and enhancing cell performance. The hole mobilities are close to spiro-OMeTAD (2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1).40 The PSSC device with HTM 10 showed a PCE of 9.1% with a high Voc of 0.94 V and a Jsc of 16.3 mA cm−2, compared to spiro-OMeTAD (Jsc of 16.8 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.91 V, FF of 67.1% and PCE of 10.2%).41
Neil et al., reported (HTM 13 and HTM 14, Fig. 6) having two diacetylide-triphenyl amine (DATPA) moieties. The hole mobility of HTM 14 (1.2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) is slightly higher compared to HTM 13 (6.0 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1), due to N⋯N interactions involving the peripheral Me2N groups. HTM 14 showed a low oxidation potential (0.44 V) compared to HTM 13 (0.17 V) and spiro-OMeTAD; because of this it acts a strong donor molecule. The PSSC devices based on these HTMs showed PCEs of 8.8% and 8.0% respectively. Although the PCEs of these two HTMs are similar, the average Jsc was increased by 2.5 mA cm−2 as the electron donor of HTM 14 was stronger than HTM 13, which indicates the ability of the hole to be transferred efficiently.42

2.3. Carbazole based HTMs
The chemical structure of carbazole has beneficial features such as good chemical stability, low cost, easy functionalization, and facile tuning of the photovoltaic properties. Based on these, Lee and co-workers reported two-arm and three-arm type HTMs (HTM 15, HTM 16 and HTM 17, Fig. 7), which are linked through phenylene, diphenylene and TPA. The UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded in THF solvent. Among these HTM 16 exhibited the lowest absorbance, due the loss of incident photons being minimized, which is a favorable property for HTM 16. The reported conductivities of HTM 15, HTM 16 and HTM 17 were 3.3 × 10−9, 4.2 × 10−8 and 1.6 × 10−8 S cm−1 respectively.43 The conductivity of HTM 16 is high, due to its intrinsic property to form a crystalline structure when it is coated as a film, which leads to a decrease in recombination rates and an increase in the PCE. The PSSC device with HTM 16 showed the highest PCE of 14.79%; under similar fabrication conditions spiro-OMeTAD exhibited 15.23%. The PSSC devices with HTM 15 and HTM 17 showed PCEs of 13.28%, 13.86% respectively; there is a decrease in PCE compared to HTM 16 due to low conductivity and Voc.44
 Fig. 7  Structures of HTM 15, HTM 16 and HTM 17, studied by Lee and co-workers. 
Sun and co-workers synthesized carbazole based HTMs (HTM 18 and HTM 19, Fig. 8). The absorption spectra were recorded using dichloromethane as solvent. HTM 18 and HTM 19 showed a strong absorption peak and weak absorption peaks at 310 nm and 370 nm respectively. The weak absorption indicates that these HTMs will not block the sunlight from efficiently reaching the sensitizing dye molecules. The mobilities and conductivities of HTM 18, HTM 19 and spiro-OMeTAD were 1.19 × 10−4, 1.51 × 10−4, 5.31 × 10−5 cm−2 V−1 s−1 and 2.88 × 10−5, 1.05 × 10−4, 8.67 × 10−5 S cm−1 respectively. HTM 19 showed superior mobility and conductivity to HTM 18 and an almost three times higher hole mobility than spiro-OMeTAD, leading to good photovoltaic performance. The theoretical studies show that HTM 19 having a larger conjugation system and lower reorganization energy, indicates faster hole transport than HTM 18. In solid state dye sensitized cells (ssDSCs) devices using the organic dye LEG4 (ref. 45) as the photosensitizer, HTM 19 showed a higher PCE of 6.0% than devices consisting of the smaller HTM 18 (4.5%); under similar conditions the spiro-OMeTAD showed a PCE of 5.5%. The device with HTM 19 employing perovskite as the sensitizer exhibited a higher PCE of 9.8% compared to HTM 18 (7.6%); under similar conditions spiro-OMeTAD exhibited a PCE of 10.2%.46 The photovoltaic parameters determined from the J–V measurements of ssDSCs based on the HTMs are tabulated in Table 1.

2.4. Quinolizino acridine based HTMs
Jaejung Ko et al., reported two novel HTMs HTM 20 and HTM 21 (Fig. 9) with planar amine or star shaped TPA as the core unit. HTM 20 has a fused quinolizino acridine, which delocalizes the cation formed after the charge separated state over a planar amine, which increases the lifetime of the charge-separated state.47HTM 21 has similar structural features to the (N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)benzidine) HTM OMe-TPD.48 The absorption spectra were recorded in chlorobenzene solvent, showing absorption peaks at 374 and 383 nm respectively. The absorption of HTM 20 was red shifted because of the more planar configuration due to the small torsion angle of the biphenyl unit. The PSSC device with HTM 20 (without dopants) exhibited a PCE of 11.07%, which was further increased up to 12.40% or 13.63% by the addition of two dopants [4-tert-butylpyridine (t-BP) and lithium bis(trifluoromethane-sulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI)] or three dopants (t-BP, Li-TFSI, and FK209)49 to the HTM layer, due to enhancement in the hole conductivity of the HTM. Under similar fabrication conditions HTM 21 with three dopants, and spiro-OMeTAD as HTMs in PSSCs resulted in PCEs of 12.31% and 14.68% respectively.50 The photovoltaic performances of PSSC devices with HTMs, without HTM and with dopants and HTM are tabulated in Table 2.

The low band gap quinolizino acridine based p-type HTM 22 (Fig. 10) in a PSSC was reported by Nazeeruddin and co-workers. The UV-vis absorption spectrum of HTM 22 was taken in chloroform as solvent, and showed absorption peaks in visible region at 421 and 580 nm, which implies it performs the function of harvesting the light through the perovskite layer. The functionalized HTM 22 induces the charge transfer transitions within the molecule and enhances the intermolecular π–π transitions, resulting in excellent hole mobility in the same range as the state-of-the-art spiro-OMeTAD and enhances the life time of the charge-separated state. The PSSC device with HTM 22 exhibited a good PCE of 12.8% (Jsc of 17.9 mA cm−2, Voc of 1036 mV and FF of 0.68) compared to spiro-OMeTAD (11.7%) under sun irradiation of 98.8 mW cm−2. Under similar fabrication conditions without a HTM, the device showed a PCE of 7.7% (Jsc = 14.0 mA cm−2, Voc = 790 mV and FF = 0.69).51

2.5. Triptycene-type molecules as HTMs
The triptycene core has some similarities, like a bulky and twisted structure, to spiro-OMeTAD, and shows a high thermal stability, high glass transition temperature (Tg) and high solubility in common organic solvents.52 Based on these properties, Grimsdale et al., reported three new HTMs (HTM 23, HTM 24, and HTM 25, Fig. 11). HTM 23, HTM 24 and HTM 25 showed absorption peaks at 305, 340, and 390 nm, respectively. The absorption peaks of HTM 24 and HTM 25 were red shifted compared to HTM 23, due to the increase in the π-conjugation. In HTM 24 the π-conjugation is prolonged by the insertion of the phenyl ring, whereas in HTM 25 by introducing the thienyl unit. HTM 24 and HTM 25 showed a slightly higher Voc than spiro-OMeTAD due to similar recombination resistance. The device fabricated without an HTM showed a PCE of 4.69%; with HTMs an increase in the PCE was observed (HTM 23 (8.42%), HTM 24 (12.24%) and HTM 25 (12.38%)), which confirms that an HTM must be a component in the device to obtain a high PCE. Under similar fabrication conditions spiro-OMeTAD showed a PCE of 12.87% (Jsc 20.8 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.976 and FF 63.4%).53

2.6. Thiophene based HTMs
Grimsdale et al., synthesized and characterized another new electron-rich molecule HTM 26 (Fig. 12) based on a 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene core structure. The absorption maximum was located at 404 nm, which was red shifted by 20 nm compared to spiro-OMeTAD (385 nm). A higher Voc was observed, due to the lowering of the HOMO level and enhancement of the FF by improving the charge transport properties. The PSSC device fabricated with HTM 26 (without doping) gave a PCE of 10.6%. The addition of 5% FK102 to the HTM 26 device gave a PCE of 12.6%. The PCE was improved to 13.8% by varying the concentration (15%) of the dopant FK102, with a higher Voc and FF. The well known spiro-OMeTAD showed a Jsc of 18.9 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.05 V, a FF of 0.69 and gave a PCE 13.7% under similar fabrication conditions.54
 Fig. 12  Structures of HTM 26, HTM 27 and HTM 28, studied by Grimsdale et al. 
To improve the potential of the properties of HTM 26, similarly, two new HTMs (HTM 27 and HTM 28, Fig. 12) with tetra substituted thiophene and tetra substituted bithiophene as the core units were developed. Replacing the ethylenedioxyl group in HTM 26 with two triarylamine groups, increasing the length and conjugation, gave HTM 27. HTM 27 and HTM 28 absorb light (λonset) from 446 nm and 477 nm respectively; HTM 28 was red shifted by 31 nm compared to HTM 27, which can be assigned to the more extended conjugation of the backbone. These HTMs have advantages, like cheaper starting materials, stable intermediates, high Tg values (due to the increase in the conjugation, which further increases the molecular size of the HTMs) and HOMO levels lower than that of HTM 26, which results in a higher Voc. These HTMs gave PCEs of 15.4% and 15.2% respectively; under similar conditions spiro-OMeTAD resulted in a PCE of 14.4%. The Jsc values of these HTMs (19.8 and 20.0 mA cm−2) were almost the same as spiro-OMeTAD (19.9 mA cm−2). The Voc values of these HTMs (1.08 V and 1.07 V) are slightly higher than spiro-OMeTAD (1.05 V).55
The Grätzel group reported new low band gap oligothiophenes including a rigid S,N-heterocene as the central moiety and terminal dicyanovinylene acceptor groups (HTM 29 and HTM 30, Fig. 13) for PSSCs. The absorption spectra were recorded in dichloromethane solution. HTM 29 showed an absorption maximum at 655 nm, whereas HTM 30 showed one at 630 nm, which is blue shifted due to the more flexible bithiophene units. The higher energy peak was absorbed at 380 nm for HTM 29, which became intense and red shifted to 430 nm in HTM 30, which can be attributed to replacing the thiophene with a bithiophene unit. The solar device with HTM 29 showed better solar cell performance (η = 10.5%) compared to HTM 30 (η = 9.5%) due to the efficient charge transport, lower HOMO energy levels, and band gap. The HTM 29 formed a dual light absorbing system with perovskite by utilizing the light in the lower energy region of the solar spectrum, which gave a new path for the fabrication and material selection for PSSCs. The device without an HTM gave a Jsc of 14.0 mA cm−2, Voc of 790 mV, FF of 0.69 and exhibited an overall PCE of 7.6%.56

Oligothiophenes containing a benzodithiophene unit as the central part and ethylrhodanine as the end group (DR3TBDTT)57 are highly efficient donors in bulk heterojunction solar cells. In view of these properties, Xiao and co-workers synthesized the new HTM 31 with modification of the alkyl groups in DR3TBDTT to get a low lying HOMO (5.39 eV) level, which matches the HOMO (5.43 eV) of perovskite. A higher PCE of 8.8% was obtained using HTM 31 and PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) and without the ion additive (Li-TFSI), compared to spiro-OMeTAD (8.9%) doped with Li-TFSI + t-BP. The introduction of lithium bis(trifluoromethyl-sulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) into the device leads to a decrease in the stability due to the hydroscopicity of the ion additives. A hole transport layer (HTL) composed of hydrophobic HTM 31 resulted in good stability of the device, due to its high hydrophobicity, with a water contact angle of 107.4°, which can protect the perovskite layer from moisture.58
2.7. 4-(Diethylamino)-benzaldehyde diphenyl hydrazone (DEH) as HTM
Johansson reported various HTMs, like spiro-OMeTAD, P3HT and HTM 32 (Fig. 14), and examined the differences in charge recombination, charge transport and PCE to choose an optimal HTM for PSSCs. The PCEs of these devices were 8.5%, 4.5% and 1.6% respectively. The large differences in the PCEs occurred due to the difference in the electron lifetimes. Electron lifetime studies revealed that the electron lifetime in spiro-OMeTAD is more than 10 times longer compared to P3HT, and more than 100 times longer than HTM 32 (Fig. 14). Photoinduced absorption spectroscopy (PIA) was carried out to observe the charge generation process in perovskite based devices with and without an HTM. The PIA studies revealed that when there is no HTM, weak features were observed in the region 1000–1400 nm. After the addition of an HTM (spiro-OMeTAD, P3HT and HTM 32) strong signals were observed, which suggested the efficient formation of oxidized species of the HTM after photoexcitation of the perovskite.59

2.8. 1,3,5-Triazines as HTMs
1,3,5-Triazine forms a radical anion after irradiation, which is stabilized due to its electron deficiency,60 and triarylamine derivatives (star shaped organic materials) are widely used as HTMs in photovoltaic devices.61 Based on this concept, Jaejung Ko and co-workers synthesized and characterized two star shaped HTMs (HTM 33 and HTM 34, Fig. 15) with donor–π–acceptor systems including an electron-deficient triazine unit and an electron rich diphenylamino unit. The hole mobilities of HTM 33, HTM 34 and spiro-OMeTAD are 1.74 × 10−4, 1.50 × 10−4, 4.43 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1 respectively, calculated by the Mott–Gurney law.62HTM 33 and HTM 34 showed absorption maxima at 429 and 412 nm in chlorobenzene. λmax of the HTM 33 was red shifted by 17 nm compared to HTM 34, which can be attributed to it possessing a 11.4° twist between the 1,3,5-triazine and the thienyl unit, whereas in HTM 34 the twist was 25.7° between the 1,3,5-triazine and the phenyl unit. These HTMs showed competitive photovoltaic performance with spiro-OMeTADs. The thiophene based HTM 33 showed better photovoltaic performance (η = 12.51%) compared to the phenyl based HTM 34 (η = 10.90%) due to a high photocurrent and fill factor. The Voc of HTM 34 is slightly higher than HTM 33, which is consistent with their HOMO levels. The thiophene based HTM showed good stability, up to 250 h in a PSSC. Under similar fabrication conditions a spiro-OMeTAD based PSSC showed a PCE of 13.45% (Jsc = 21.37 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.93 V, FF = 0.67).63

2.9. 
          N,N,N′,N′-tetra-Phenylbenzidine (TPB) based HTMs
Meng and co-workers synthesized two HTMs (HTM 35 and HTM 36, Fig. 16) by introducing electron donating groups [3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) and N-ethyl carbazole (NEC)] to N,N,N′,N′-tetra-phenylbenzidine (TPB) asymmetrically. The non-planar TPB core plays the key role in preventing the close contact between the perovskite and HTM, which leads to a reduction in the charge recombination rate and electronic coupling. The absorption spectra were recorded in DCM. TPB showed a peak in the UV region, whereas HTM 35 and 36 showed a red shift of their absorption band to the visible region, due to the extended conjugation. This indicates that insertion of the electron-donating cores (EDOT and NEC) enhances the electron density in the TPB core, which tunes the HOMO and LUMO levels efficiently. The HOMO levels of both HTM 35 and HTM 36 were low, which led to a higher Voc than the spiro-OMeTAD. The PSSC with HTM 36 showed a PCE (13.10%) without doping which is comparable with doped spiro-OMeTAD (13.28%). The PSSC with HTM 35 exhibited a PCE of 10.29%, which is lower than HTM 36, due to the low charge recombination rate. The PSSC devices with dopants (LiTFSI:t-BP) and HTMs resulted in lower photovoltaic performances and gave PCEs of 5.48% and 8.06% respectively, due to their higher charge recombination rates.64

3. Other HTMs: conjugated polymers as HTMs
3.1. Triphenyl based polymers as HTMs
Nazeeruddin reported a novel 2,4-dimethoxy-phenyl substituted triarylamine oligomer (HTM 37, Fig. 17) as an HTM in PSSCs. The HOMO energy level of HTM 37 (5.12 V) is higher than the perovskite, allowing efficient hole transfer from the perovskite to HTM 37. The hole mobility of HTM 37 measured using organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) is 5.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with W/L = 15000/5 cm, which is higher by an order of magnitude as compared to spiro-OMeTAD (Mw = 1225 g mol−1, 4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). Being significantly smaller than the high molecular weight polymer poly-triaryl amine (PTAA) (Mw = 17500 g mol−1, 4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1), HTM 37 can easily contact the perovskite. The PSSC device with HTM 37 showed a PCE of 12.0%. The PSSC device with PTTA as the HTM showed a PCE of 10.1%. Table 3 shows the photovoltaic performance of the best devices and the averages of a selection of cells made under the same conditions.65

3.2. Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) polymer based HTMs
The p-type polymer poly[N-9-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-3,6-bis-(thiophen-5-yl)-2,5-dioctyl-2,5-di-hydropyrrolo[3,4-]pyrrole-1,4-dione] (HTM 38, Fig. 18) has good stability and hole mobility and a HOMO level comparable to poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT). BHJ organic solar cells with HTM 38 and PC70BM displayed good performance with PCEs of 1.6–3.6%.66,67 Considering these advantages, Qiu and co-workers examined this as an HTM to fabricate solid-state hybrid solar cells with hybrid organolead halide perovskite nanoparticles as the light harvester and mesoporous TiO2 as the electron transporting material. The PSSC device containing HTM 38 showed a PCE of 3.04% with a high Voc of 1.15 V. The high Voc is due to several factors; one is the negligible difference between the valence band maximum of CH3NH3PbBr3 and the HOMO level of HTM 38, another one is large offset between the conduction band of perovskite and the quasi-Fermi levels of TiO2, which leads to a possible interaction between TiO2/perovskite/HTM 38, and the superior hole mobility of HTM 38. The photovoltaic performances of PSSC devices having HTM 38 as the HTM with different CH3NH3PbBr3 concentrations of 0.1 M, 0.2 M. 0.3 M, 0.4 M and 0.5 M in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) are shown in Table 4. The devices are denoted as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. All the devices showed a high Voc > 1.0 V except device 1, and the devices 3–5 showed a Voc of approximately 1.15 V, which is higher than GaAs-based photovoltaic cells (∼1.12 V).68 The PSSC devices which replace CH3NH3PbBr3 with CH3NH3PbI3 absorb a significantly wide range of the solar spectrum, resulting in a high Jsc (13.9 mA cm−2) with a PCE of 5.5% . Under similar fabrication conditions a PSSC with P3HT as the HTM showed a PCE of 0.76%.69 The photovoltaic parameters of HTM 38 are shown in Table 4.

The Park group reported the DPP based highly conjugated p-type HTM 39 (Fig. 18) poly[2,5-bis(2-decyldodecyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione-(E)-1,2-di(2,2′-bithiophen-5-yl)ethene]. HTM 39 showed a hole mobility slightly higher than P3HT and one order of magnitude higher than the spiro-OMeTAD at the same charge density. These results showed that the DPP-based HTM displayed superior electrical properties. The transient absorption spectroscopy (TMS) studies showed lower mobility which is comparable with the field effect transistor (FET) measurements (0.32 cm2 V−1 s−1) due to its poor crystallinity in combination with TiO2, less efficient pore penetration into the TiO2 and higher charge density for measuring FET mobilities. The PSSC device with HTM 39 displayed a considerably better performance than spiro-MeOTAD and P3HT. The device prepared with HTM 39 displayed a Jsc of 14.4 mA cm−2, a Voc of 855.3 mV, a FF of 74.9%, and resulted in a PCE of 9.2%; under similar conditions the spiro-MeOTAD and P3HT showed Jsc values of 14.3 mA cm−2 and 14.0 mA cm−2, Voc values of 849.2 mV and 620.1 mV, FF values of 62.5% and 72.2%, and resulted in PCEs of 7.6%, 6.3% respectively.70
Park and co-workers reported dichlorobenzene-functionalized HTM 40 (a polymer composed of TT-BO, TT-DCB and BDT-EH), and the non-functionalized polymer HTM 41 (a polymer composed of TT and BDT), where TT-BO is 2′-butyloctyl-4,6-dibromo-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate, TT-DCB is 3′,4′-dichlorobenzyl-4,6-dibromo-3-fluorothieno-[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate, BDT-EH is 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(2-thylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′] dithiophene, TT is [3,4-]thiophene and BDT is benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene. HTM 40 (Fig. 19) was synthesized by the replacement of the hydrophobic alkyl chains (3,4-dichlorobenzyl groups) in HTM 41, and showed good intermolecular chemical interactions (ion–dipole and cation–π interactions) which further led to faster electron transport and a slower charge recombination rate. To study the effect of photovoltaic parameters of HTM 40, they performed transient photocurrent and voltage spectroscopic studies. These studies concluded that there is an increase in the electron diffusion coefficient (De) and a decrease in the charge recombination rate which gave a higher Voc, resulting in a PCE of 8.7%.71
 Fig. 19  Structures of HTM 40 and HTM 41, studied by Park and co-workers. 
Our group reported a p-type conjugated D–A co-polymer (HTM 42, Fig. 20) having a benzodithiophene donor and benzo[1,2,5]thiadiazole acceptor as a hole transporting material. The hole mobility of HTM 42 is about 6.68 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 which is higher than that of P3HT (2.45 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), which implies that it showed higher conductivity than P3HT due to the efficient hole transfer. The PSSC device with HTM 42 gave a higher PCE of 6.64% and a higher FF of 0.66% than the P3HT based device (PCE of 4.24% with FF = 0.56%) because of reduced series resistance and fast charge transport. Furthermore, the space charge effect is reduced in the TiO2/perovskite/HTM 42 junction as compared to the TiO2/perovskite/P3HT junction as a result of the small difference in the mobilities between the electron and hole, resulting in balanced charge transport, leading to enhancement of the FF and PCE. The PSSC device fabricated without an HTM exhibited a relatively good photovoltaic response (Jsc = 9.22 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.62 V, FF = 0.48 and PCE = 2.74%).72
 Fig. 20  Structure of HTM 42, studied by our group. 
Zuqiang Bian et al., reported the polythiophene HTM 43 (Fig. 21), which was prepared via electrochemical polymerization.73 To tune the oxidation potential, BFEE (boron trifluoride-diethyl etherate) was employed as the supporting electrolyte. There are no substituents present on HTM 43, which helps to improve the inter-chain packing significantly, which yielded compact thin films with high conductivity. The thin film of HTM 43 showed absorption in the range of 400–600 nm, with the absorption maximum at about 530 nm. The HOMO and LUMO levels of the polythiophene films are −5.20 and −3.12 eV, respectively. The HOMO of this HTM is nearly the same as spiro-OMeTAD. The PSC (ITO/polythiophene/perovskite/C60/BCP/Ag) device with an 18 nm thickness of HTM 43 as the HTM showed a PCE of 11.8% (Voc = 1.03 V, Jsc = 16.2 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.707). In this study, the authors did many experiments on the film thickness, and it was noticed that sometimes this device showed a better PCE, up to 13.2%.
 Fig. 21  Structure of HTM 43, studied by Zuqiang Bian et al. 
The same research group demonstrated ultrathin polythiophene (PT) films prepared via electrochemical polymerization and used as HTMs.74 After careful optimization, the devices showed the highest PCE of ∼15.4 with a Voc of 0.99 V, Jsc of 20.3 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.774 with the device specification of ITO/PT (∼5 nm)/perovskite (∼245 nm)/C60 (40 nm)/BCP (10 nm)/Ag (100 nm). Using similar device fabrication and evaluation conditions, PEDOT:PSS as an HTM in place of PT showed a decrease in the photovoltaic parameters.74
Yaoming Xiao et al., synthesized a p-type HTM for all-solid-state perovskite sensitized solar cells (ass-PSSC) based on polyaniline with a brachyplast structure.75 This p-type HTM acts as a sensitizer as well as an HTM. The device was highly stable using this dual functional p-type HTM. They studied three kinds of ass-PSSC devices; (1) ass-PSSC-A (without perovskite and Li-salt) showed a PCE of 2.06%, a Jsc of 10.06 mA cm−1, a Voc of 0.57 V, and a FF of 0.36; (2) ass-PSSC-B showed an improved PCE of 5.13%, a Jsc of 12.84 mA cm−1, a Voc of 0.74 V, and a FF of 0.54; (3) ass-PSSC-C (using Li-salt) obtained a PCE of 7.34%, a Jsc of 14.48 mA cm−1, a Voc of 0.78 V, and a FF of 0.65.75 It was concluded that ass-PSSC-C showed better performance due to a decrease in the series resistance (Photovoltaic parameters of all HTMs tabulated in Table 5).

HTMs play an important role in PSSCs; however, there are some recent studies on PSSCs without HTMs, in which the perovskite, such as CH3NH3PbI3, can function simultaneously as a light harvester and as a HTM. For instance, Etgar reported a HTM-free PSSC with a high power conversion efficiency of 8%,76 due to holes being extracted significantly more efficiently than electrons in CH3NH3PbI3.77 Recently, Xiao presented an in situ method to prepare HTM-free PSSCs with power conversion efficiencies of 9.03%, 10.03% and 12.22%, confirming that the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/Au cell is an efficient heterojunction cell.78–80
4. Conclusion and future prospects
As described above, hole transporting materials are currently under intensive investigation and show great promise for new large scale cost-competitive photovoltaic technologies. They offer a wide number of practical advantages over liquid-electrolyte junction devices in PSSCs. In this paper, we reviewed recent advances in HTMs and their applications for PSSCs. The small molecule HTMs exhibited good thermal stabilities, high hole mobilities and appropriate HOMO levels, indicating that these materials can be promising for good efficiencies. We believe that this review will open new avenues for the development of novel HTMs for enhancing the photovoltaic parameters of PSSCs.
