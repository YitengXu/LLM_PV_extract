1. Introduction
Metal selenide semiconductor nanomaterials (NMs) such as binary Sb2Se3, CuSe, ternary CuInSe2 and quaternary CuInGaSe2 compounds have attracted great interest due to their unique optical and electric properties and potential for wide application in photoelectric detectors, thin film transistors, thin film solar cells, etc.1–4 Recently, nanocrystal-based ink deposition technology has provided a promising way to largely reduce the cost of manufacture of semiconducting thin films through solution processing, such as dip coating, spin coating, spray coating and roll-to-roll printing.5 As is well known, compared with various alternative sulfur sources with highly reactive, stable and soluble characteristics such as dodecanethiol (DT), ammonium sulfide, thiourea, thioacetamide, sodium sulfide, etc. which are commonly used for preparing metal sulfur nanomaterials,6–9 highly reactive, soluble and stable selenium precursors used for synthesizing metal selenide nanomaterials are very limited.10 The traditional preparation of soluble selenium usually needs alkylphosphines such as trioctylphosphine (TOP) or tributylphosphine (TBP), but they are costly, unstable and toxic.11,12 Other strategies to synthesize selenide NCs are direct dissolution of selenium powder or other selenium precursors in high-boiling solvents such as octadecene, oleylamine (OLA), olive oil, and paraffin.13–20 However, the reactivity of Se precursors in these approaches is difficult to control, and the solubility is also limited. Zhang's group has reported a novel route to dissolve selenium powder in a mixed solvent of OLA and DT to form a highly reactive and soluble Se precursor, which was successfully used to synthesise various metal selenide NCs such as CdSe, CuInGaSe2 and Cu2ZnSnSe4 in an OLA system.21 Subsequently, Agrawal's group confirms that selenium powder can be positively dissolved in a solution combining OLA with a series of alkylthiols, which can also be utilized to synthesize a variety of selenide nanoparticles such as Cu2Se, PbSe, CuInSe2 and Cu2ZnSnSe4 in an OLA system.22
In our previous report, a facile and environmentally-friendly triethylene glycol (TEG) process has been successfully used to prepare well-dispersed and single-phase CuInSe2 nanoparticles and nanoplates using a selenium precursor obtained from hydrazine- or ethylenediamine-assisted dissolution.23–25 However, in order to obtain the reactive and soluble selenium precursor, a high solution temperature (above 210 °C) and an oxygen-free environment were necessary. Actually, low temperature dissolution of selenium precursors is valuable. In this paper, to avoid high temperature dissolution and highly-toxic hydrazine hydrate utilization, a novel and low-toxic mixed solvent of monoethanolamine and thioglycolic acid was firstly utilized to dissolve Se powder at room temperature in air. The highly reactive, soluble and stable Se precursor was successfully utilized to synthesise a variety of metal selenide nanomaterials such as Sb2Se3 nanorods, CuSe nanoplates and CuInSe2 nanocrystals at a lower temperature (180 °C), compared to our previous reports, which may provide new potential and strategies to synthesize other metal selenide nanomaterials, under relatively low synthetic temperature or even a heating-up process. In addition, the synthesized CuInSe2 NCs were employed to prepare ethanol colloidal ink and deposited smooth CuInSe2 thin films by a dip-coating method followed by selenization annealing at 550 °C for 30 min to form CuInSe2 thin films with a high degree of crystallinity and large particle size. Photovoltaic devices were fabricated by using the synthesized CuInSe2 thin films as a light-absorbing layer and a power conversion efficiency of 2.65% was achieved under AM 1.5 illumination.
2. Experimental section
Materials
Antimony trichloride (SbCl3, 99.9%, Aladdin), copper(II) chloride (CuCl2, 99%, Aladdin), indium(III) chloride (InCl3·4H2O, 99%, Aladdin), selenium powder (Se, 99%, Aladdin), triethylene glycol (C6H14O4, 99%, Aladdin), monoethanolamine (HO(CH2)2NH2, 99%, Aladdin), thioglycolic acid (HSCH2COOH, 98%, Aladdin), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, Mr = 48000, Aladdin), absolute ethanol (CH3CH2OH, 99.7%, Aladdin), high-purity nitrogen gas and argon gas. All chemicals were used as received.
Preparation of metal selenide NMs
In a typical synthesis of Sb2Se3 nanorods, 0.5 mmol of SbCl3 was dissolved into 10 mL of TEG in a beaker with magnetic stirring at room temperature for 1 h to get a clear solution which is named solution A. 1.5 mmol of Se powder was poured into the mixed solution combining 1.35 ml of monoethanolamine (MEA) and 0.15 ml of thioglycolic acid (TGA) and stirred for 0.5 h at room temperature to form a dark red solution. The Se precursor solution mentioned above together with 0.1 g of PVP was added into 40 mL of TEG in a 100 mL three-neck flask to form solution B. The three-neck flask was attached to a condenser and heated to a temperature of 180 °C under nitrogen stream where solution A was rapidly injected into solution B in the three-neck flask with vigorous stirring. The reaction solution was incubated at 180 °C for 20 min. Then the resultant solution was cooled to room temperature. The products were purified by washing with absolute ethanol and deionized water followed by centrifugation six times. The preparation procedure of CuSe NPs and CuInSe2 NCs is the same as that of Sb2Se3 NRs except that solution A is composed of 0.5 mmol of CuCl2 for CuSe NPs and 0.5 mmol of CuCl2 together with 0.5 mmol of InCl3 for CuInSe2 NCs, and the Se precursor is composed of 0.5 mmol of Se dissolved in a mixed solution of 0.45 ml of MEA and 0.05 ml of TGA for CuSe NPs and 1 mmol of Se dissolved in a mixed solution of 0.9 ml of MEA and 0.1 ml of TGA for CuInSe2 NCs, respectively.
Photovoltaic test devices
PV devices were fabricated with a conventional sandwich-type soda-lime glass/Mo/CuInSe2/CdS/i-ZnO/Al-doped ZnO (AZO) configuration. The molybdenum back contact, CdS buffer layer and i-ZnO/AZO top contact were prepared according to the reference.26 A thick layer of CuInSe2 thin films was deposited by a layer-by-layer dip-coating method using ethanol-based colloidal ink repeatedly for several times. Then the films were annealed in Ar at 400 °C for 1 h in order to remove the organic species followed by selenization in an Ar and Se atmosphere at 550 °C for 30 min.
Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was detected by a Rigaku D/Max 2500 V/PC X-ray powder diffractometer with CuKα radiation. FESEM morphology and energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDX) analyses were conducted using a Nova Nano SEM450 emission scanning electron microscope. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were performed using a Tecnai G2 F20 field emission transmission electron microscope. Absorption spectra were recorded by a UV-3600 UV-vis absorption spectrometer with spectral resolution up to 0.1 nm using an optical integrating sphere. Power conversion efficiencies were measured using a San-Ei Electric PV cell tester and a Xenon lamp solar simulator equipped with an AM 1.5 filter.
3. Results and discussion
It can be seen in Fig. 1(a) and (b) that neither monoethanolamine (MEA) nor thioglycolic acid (TGA) solution alone can dissolve selenium powder. But it can be successfully dissolved in a mixed solvent of MEA and TGA with a volume ratio of 9:1 to form a dark red solution at room temperature in air, which is shown in Fig. 1(c). The maximum concentration of selenium in the mixed solution is above 2 M. In addition, the synthesized selenium solution is very stable for more than half a year without any observed precipitation even in air. The stability of our as-prepared Se solution is better than that of the reported selenium solution dissolved in OLA and DT, which will be quickly precipitated within 2 h in air.21 Recently, many research studies have indicated that thiol-based and amine-based mixed solutions such as OLA and DDT, hexadecanethiol (HT)21 or ethanethiol22 can efficiently dissolve certain amounts of selenium. The possible mechanism of dissolution may be attributed to the reason that selenium is firstly reduced by the thiol followed by combining with OLA to form an OLA–Se complex. Therefore, considering the previous research mentioned above, we propose that the possible dissolution mechanism in our system is similar to that of the OLA-DDT system wherein selenium is firstly reduced by the thiol of TGA followed by combining with the amine of MEA to form an MEA–Se complex.

We used the synthesized dark red selenium solution as a selenium precursor and added it dropwise into the reactive TEG solution. After injection of different cationic solutions such as SbCl3, CuCl2 or CuCl2 together with InCl3 in TEG at 180 °C for 20 min, the products Sb2Se3, CuSe, and CuInSe2 NMs can be obtained, respectively. Fig. 2(a) shows the XRD pattern of the synthesized Sb2Se3 products. According to the standard PDF card (No. 15-0861), it can be seen that all the diffraction peaks are indexed to the Sb2Se3 phase with an orthorhombic structure, but the 2θ degrees of all the diffraction peaks show a little shift toward higher angles, which may be attributed to the doping of sulfur derived from TGA. Since the radius of sulfur ions is smaller than that of selenium ions, it will result in the decrease of the Sb2Se3 lattice constant with the doping of sulfur ions. According to the Bragg diffraction formula 2dsinθ = nλ, the θ degree will increase with the decrease of the lattice constant. The energy dispersive X-ray spectra (EDX) shown in Fig. 2(b) also indicate that the chemical composition of the synthesized products is composed of elements Sb, Se and S, with a Sb/Se/S molar ratio of 1:1.22:0.24 and a Sb/(Se + S) molar ratio of 1:1.46, which is a nearly stoichiometric ratio. Fig. 2(c) and (e) show the XRD patterns of the synthesized CuSe and CuInSe2 products. All the diffraction peaks of the samples (Fig. 2(c) and (e)) can be respectively assigned to hexagonal CuSe (JCPDS No. 06-0427) and tetragonal CuInSe2 (JCPDS No. 40-1487), both of which have an obviously shift toward higher angles. It may also be attributed to the doping of sulfur in the CuSe and CuInSe2 crystal lattice. The EDX spectra also confirm our assumption, which are shown in Fig. 2(d) and (f). Both CuSe and CuInSe2 products have the element sulfur in the chemical composition. For the CuSe product, the Cu/Se/S molar ratio is 1:0.65:0.44, which is a nearly stoichiometric ratio. For the CuInSe2 product, the Cu/In/Se/S molar ratio is 1:1.04:1.20:0.92, which is also a nearly stoichiometric ratio. In a word, the XRD and EDX results shown in Fig. 2 indicate that the single-phase metal selenide nanomaterials such as Sb2Se3 nanorods, CuSe nanoplates and CuInSe2 nanocrystals can be successfully prepared by using a TEG-based process with the highly active and soluble selenium precursor. Moreover, the sulfur from TGA will also be doped in the metal selenide NMs. With increasing sulfur content in the metal selenides, the degree of shift of all the diffraction peaks of the metal selenides will increase due to the shrinkage of the crystalline lattice.

Fig. 3(a) shows the TEM image of the synthesized Sb2Se3 products, in which it can be seen that the synthesized sample is composed of well-dispersed and smooth nanorods with a length ranging from 400 nm to 1.4 μm and an average diameter of 80 nm. The HRTEM image shown in Fig. 3(b) indicates that the Sb2Se3 nanorods are single-crystalline structures with an interplanar spacing of 5.20 Å and 3.92 Å, corresponding to the (120) and (001) planes of orthorhombic Sb2Se3. The result also indicates that the preferential growth direction of the Sb2Se3 nanorods is along the [001] crystal orientation, which is in good agreement with previous research.27 The preferential growth direction is determined intrinsically by the anisotropic Sb–Se atom chain or layer structure of the orthorhombic Sb2Se3.28Fig. 3(c) presents the TEM image of the synthesized CuSe products; it can be seen that the products are well-dispersed and smooth hexagonal nanoplates with the size ranging from 100 nm to 500 nm. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern, inserted in Fig. 3(c), shows single-crystal diffraction spots with typical hexagonal symmetry for the hexagonal crystalline lattices. The HRTEM image in Fig. 3(d) shows that the CuSe nanoplates are single-crystal structures with an interplanar distance of 3.34 Å for the (101) plane of hexagonal CuSe. In addition, the TEM image of the synthesized CuInSe2 products shown in Fig. 3(e) shows that the particle-like CuInSe2 nanocrystals are well-dispersed and uniform, with an average size of 8 nm. Fig. 3(f) indicates that the CuInSe2 nanocrystals are also single-crystalline structures with an interplanar spacing of 3.27 Å and 1.98 Å, corresponding to the (112) and (220) planes of tetragonal chalcopyrite CuInSe2, respectively.

In order to study the optical properties of the synthesized metal selenide NMs, the UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of the products are recorded in Fig. 4. It can be seen that the Sb2Se3 NRs dispersed in ethanol show a strong absorption over the entire visible light spectrum and near infrared region, as shown in Fig. 4(a), and the band-gap value Eg calculated by the Tauc relation of the direct band-gap semiconductor (Fig. 4(b)) is 1.27 eV. The value is slightly larger than those obtained in other studies,29,30 which may be attributed to the doping of sulfur in Sb2Se3. Fig. 4(c) presents the UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of the synthesized CuSe NPs. The sample displays an absorbance shape with a direct band gap in the visible region and a broad absorption in the near-infrared region due to the localized plasmon resonance (LSPR) of the free holes in the valence band,31–34 and the band gap calculated by the Tauc relation is 1.89 eV (Fig. 4(d)). The absorbance shape and the band-gap value of the synthesized CuSe NPs agree well with those of early reported CuSySe1−y nanoplates,35 which is also attributed to the doping of sulfur in the product. Fig. 4(e) displays the absorption spectra of the synthesized CuInSe2 NCs, which show a typical absorbing character in the visible light spectrum region.15 However, the band gap of 1.52 eV (Fig. 4(f)) calculated by the Tauc relation is much larger than the 1.04 eV for bulk α-CuInSe2.3 Although the doping of sulfur in CuInSe2 will increase the band gap, the largest band gap for CuInSexS1−x is up to 1.5 eV when x is equal to 0.36 As is known, the Bohr radius of the CuInSe2 NCs is about 10.6 nm,37 which is larger than that of our synthesized NCs, leading to the increase of the band gap of the as-prepared CuInSe2 NCs due to the quantum size effect. Therefore, the two factors mentioned above will result in an obvious increase of the band gap of the synthesized CuInSe2 NCs.

The ethanol-based CuInSe2 NCs were used to deposit the ink-coated thin films by a dip-coating process. Fig. 5(a) and (b) are the cross-section FESEM images of the CuInSe2 thin films before and after annealing at 550 °C in a selenizing atmosphere. It can be seen that the smooth and crack-free CuInSe2 thin films with a thickness of 1 μm are composed of small nanoparticles before annealing, which is shown in Fig. 5(a). After selenization at 550 °C in a graphite box of a tubular furnace under Ar protection, the CuInSe2 thin films exhibit a bilayer structure which has a top layer with large grains of size up to 500 nm and a bottom layer with fine grains of about tens of nanometers. In addition, the thickness of the top layer is about 540 nm, while that of the bottom layer is about 400 nm (Fig. 5(b)). Fig. 5(c) shows the XRD patterns of the synthesized CuInSe2 thin films before and after selenization. It can be seen that the XRD patterns of the CuInSe2 thin films after selenization become much sharper and stronger, which means that the degree of crystallinity of the thin films is tremendously enhanced compared to the films without selenization. The major diffraction peaks at 2θ = 26.80°, 44.42° and 52.62° of the CuInSe2 films after selenization, which can be assigned to the (112), (220) and (312) planes of chalcopyrite CuInSe2, have an obviously shift to minor angles compared to the films without selenization. The phenomenon mentioned above is attributed to the replacement of sulfur in CuInSe2 thin films by selenium after selenization. A CuInSe2-based thin film solar cell is constructed by using a typical cell structure of Mo/CuInSe2/CdS/i-ZnO/Al–ZnO. The optical-electric conversion efficiency of the CuInSe2-based solar cell is characterized under standard AM 1.5, which is shown in Fig. 5(d). It can be clearly seen that the energy conversion efficiency reaches 2.65% with a filling factor of 46%, an open voltage Voc of 452 mV and a short current density Jsc of 12.75 mA cm−2.

4. Conclusion
In summary, a low-toxic, highly-reactive and soluble selenium solution was obtained by dissolving selenium powder in a mixture solvent of monoethanolamine and thioglycolic acid with a volume ratio of 9:1 at room temperature in air. Utilizing the selenium solution mentioned above as a Se precursor, various metal selenides such as Sb2Se3 NRs, CuSe NPs and CuInSe2 NCs were successfully prepared using a TEG-based hot-injection process. The synthesized CuInSe2 NCs were applied to prepare ethanol-based colloidal ink and then deposited thin films by a dip-coating process followed by selenization to form a dense film. A power conversion efficiency of 2.65% has been achieved by using the CuInSe2 thin films as a light-absorbing layer under AM 1.5 illumination. Using an environmentally-friendly and low-cost polyol synthesis process with a novel and highly-reactive selenium solution as a Se precursor may provide an efficient way to synthesize various binary, ternary and quaternary metal selenide nanomaterials such as CdSe, SnSe, AgInSe2, Cu2ZnSnSe4, etc., which is under way in our laboratory.
