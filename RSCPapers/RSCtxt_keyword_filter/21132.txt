    , Accepted 14th October 2017First published on 16th October 2017AbstractIn this work, we found that foreign metallic ion (In3+) treatment enhanced the photoelectrochemical (PEC) activity of hematite nanosheets aligning on a substrate without joining the host lattice. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation indicated that the In3+ ion treatment nearly did not change the size and thickness of the hematite nanosheets during solvothermal synthesis. However, the treatment reduced nanosheet stacking and increased the active surface area of the hematite photoanode. Careful combined analyses involving Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed that In3+ ions were not doped in the hematite nanosheets. Interestingly, after the In3+ treatment, the photoelectrochemical properties of the hematite nanosheets were highly enhanced when they were used as a photoanode for water splitting. The photocurrent density at 1.23 V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode) was 2.6 times as high as that of the hematite without In3+-treatment. The improved PEC activity was deduced to be associated with the increased active surface area for higher light absorption and more photoelectrode/electrolyte junctions, as well as higher carrier density after the In3+-treatment. Furthermore, the efficiencies of the surface charge separation and charge transfer for the In3+-treated hematite nanosheets also increased much more.
1. Introduction
Since the ground-breaking work of Fujishima and Honda,1 which described a novel type of photo-electrochemical cell for the photolysis of water at a TiO2 semiconductor electrode, the search for efficient and stable photoelectrode materials for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has never ceased trying to address the increasing global energy demand. The semiconductor in the PEC process absorbs solar energy and generates electrical charges that drive the electrolysis reaction, splitting the water into hydrogen at the cathode and oxygen at the anode.2 Yet, to date, the overall photoconversion efficiency is relatively low and requires further promotion for its commercialization.3
During the past few decades, a variety of semiconductors have been examined as candidate photoelectrode materials for PEC water splitting.3,4 Because of its outstanding chemical stability, low-cost, and appropriate band gap (∼2.1 eV) for visible light, hematite (α-Fe2O3) is particularly suited to commercial scale-up for PEC water splitting.5–7 Unfortunately, hematite has disadvantages that include poor visible-light absorption and the short diffusion length of charges with high recombination. These properties would cause an undesirable PEC performance of hematite during practical applications.
Several efforts have been made to improve the PEC performance of hematite to address these issues,8–16 one of which is by controlling the dimensions and morphologies of the materials at the nanometer scale, such as 1D nanotubes and 2D nanosheets.17–22 Two-dimensional nanosheets are proposed as an ideal platform for highly efficient PEC water splitting.23–26 2D nanosheets perfectly provide the possibility to facilitate the charge migration with enough light harvesting, as well as a very short hole diffusion length, to reach the electrolyte interface before simultaneously recombining with electrons.27 Another usual way to improve the PEC performance of hematite is treating hematite by metallic ion doping. Appropriate ion doping can increase the depletion layer thickness or enhance the conductivity of the hematite photoanode. So far, many non-trivalent metallic ions were introduced into hematite nanocrystals, such as Ti4+, Sn4+, Zn2+etc., to increase the carrier concentration or the thickness of the depletion layer.28–37 In addition, isovalent metallic ions, such as Al(III) and In(III), were also reported to join hematite to enhance the conductivity for higher PEC performance, although they do not significantly change the band structure and carrier concentration.31,38 However, all the reported metallic ion treatments were attempted to incorporate ions into the hematite lattice. To the best of our knowledge, very few cases have been reported on enhancing the PEC activity of hematite by foreign metallic ion treatment with no doping in the lattice.
Foreign metallic ions have been proven as efficient directors in controlled synthesis and tailoring properties of nanostructures, such as metal Pd nanoparticles,39,40 Cu2Se nanocubes,41 and In2S3 nanosheets.42 The role of metallic ions is suggested to promote the crystal growth in a specific direction through selected adsorption on different crystalline planes of nanocrystals, although they did not incorporate into the nanocrystals. In this work, we introduced foreign In3+ treatment in fabricating hematite nanosheets aligning on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass to improve their PEC performance, in which In3+ ions did not change the size and thickness and did not join the lattice of the α-Fe2O3 nanosheets. Compared with the untreated hematite nanosheets, the In3+-treated α-Fe2O3 nanosheets showed that the photocurrent density increased as high as 2.6 times at 1.23 V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode, vs. RHE) when used as the photoanode in PEC water splitting. The enhanced PEC performances were related to the increased active surface area for higher light absorption and more photoelectrode/electrolyte junctions, as well as the reduced diffusion distance of charges from the photoanode to the interfaces between the materials and electrolyte.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Chemical agents
In(NO3)3·4.5H2O (99%) and potassium hexacyanoferrate(II) trihydrate (K4Fe(CN)6·3H2O) were provided by J&K Ltd. Iron(III) chloride was purchased from Acros Organics. Ammonia solution (25%) is of analytical grade (Beijing chemical works). Zinc chloride and zirconium chloride were analytical grade and purchased from Beijing chemical works and Stream chemical, respectively. All the chemicals were used after receiving with no further purification. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass was obtained from Wuhan Geao Instruments (15 Ω cm−2).
2.2. Fabrication of α-Fe2O3 nanosheets by two-time hydrothermal growth
A piece of FTO glass (3 cm × 1 cm) was ultrasonically cleaned with H2O–ethanol–acetone (1/1/1 v/v/v) solution and deionized (DI) water for 20 min, respectively. In a typical route to synthesize α-Fe2O3 nanosheets, 0.15 mmol K4Fe(CN)6·3H2O (0.0633 g) and H2O (15.0 mL) were poured into a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave at 25 °C with stirring for 6 min. Moreover, 200 μL ammonium solution was poured into the above reaction solution with stirring for 6 min again. After that, the autoclave was sealed and heated at 200 °C for 5 h in an oven. After naturally cooling to ambient temperature, the FTO substrate was taken out. The FTO was thoroughly washed with DI water to remove the residual salt and dried by air blowing. To make sure that the substrate can be covered homogenously, the process of growth was repeated for another time. Finally, the FTO was annealed in air in a muffle furnace at 500 °C. The temperature of the muffle furnace was heated from room temperature to the set point using a heating rate of 2 °C min−1. The samples were kept at this temperature for 5 h to complete the conversion. The process was depicted in Scheme 1.

2.3. Synthesis of In3+-treated α-Fe2O3 nanosheets
In3+-treated α-Fe2O3 was synthesized through the same way except for adding 0.0097 g (0.025 mmol) In(NO3)3·4.5H2O into the precursor solution.
As control, we also prepared untreated and In-treated Fe2O3 samples with iron(III) chloride (FeCl3) as the Fe source by the same process, except for replacing potassium hexacyanoferrate(II) trihydrate by FeCl3.
2.4. Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a Rigaku D/Max 2200 PC diffractometer (λ = 0.15418 nm) with a graphite monochromator at 5.0° min−1. Crystalline-cell parameters were calculated using the JADE 5 program. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, HITACHI S-4800) with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analyzer was used to characterize the size and morphology as well as analyze the chemical composition and element distribution of samples. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM-2100F) was employed to observe the crystalline structure and lattice fringes combined with selected area electron diffraction (SAED). The components and surface of nanocrystals were characterized by using an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyzer. The XPS spectra were recorded on a PHI-5300 ESCA spectrometer (PerkinElmer) where Al Kα was used as the excitation source. After subtraction of X-ray satellites and inelastic background (Shirley-type), peak deconvolution was carried out. The UV–visible absorption spectra were recorded on a spectrometer of Shimadzu (UV2550). The Fe3+ and In3+ concentrations in the aqueous solution were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS Agilent 7500C).
2.5. Calculations
The calculations were carried out using the VASP program.43 A revised Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional (RPBE) was used, which improves the description of molecule adsorption on transition-metal surfaces.44 The GGA+U method was adopted to describe the strongly correlated localized 3d electrons for Fe atoms. The U–J value was set to 4.0 eV.45 The projector-augmented wave was used throughout the calculations. Firstly, bulk α-Fe2O3 was calculated.46 Since no ferromagnetism was observed, an anti-ferromagnetic configuration for α-Fe2O3 was considered.47 Then a two-dimensional model that contains twelve Fe atoms and eighteen O atoms was cut along the (001) direction from the bulk structure. The vacuum layer was set to 10 Å.
2.6. Photoelectrochemical water splitting test
All PEC measurements were conducted on a typical three-electrode electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments 660D) using the Fe2O3 nanosheets/FTO or the In3+-treated Fe2O3/FTO as the working electrode, a platinum plate as the counter electrode, and an Hg/HgO electrode as the reference electrode. The electrolyte was 1 M NaOH in deionized water. A 350 W xenon lamp provided simulated solar light for PEC tests (100 mW cm−2). The schematic illustration of the working mechanism of the photoelectrochemical cell is shown in Scheme S1 (see the ESI†). Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV) was performed at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. NaOH–H2O2 solutions were used to measure the charge separation efficiency on the surface of the hematite photoanode. The measured potentials vs. Hg/HgO were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale according to the Nernst equation (1): ERHE = EHg/HgO + 0.059 pH + E0Hg/HgO(1)where ERHE is the converted potential vs. RHE, E0Hg/HgO = 0.098 V at 25 °C, and EHg/HgO is the experimentally measured potential against the Hg/HgO reference. The photocurrent stability measurement of the In3+-treated sample at 1.23 V vs. RHE was performed under 100 mW cm−2 illumination for 4.5 hours. The incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was measured at 1.23 V versus RHE with a monochromator in the range of 400–800 nm (7IMS1021, Saifan, Beijing instrument Co. Ltd). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was conducted in the same workstation with a frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 1 × 106 Hz at a potential of 1.23 vs. RHE without illumination. The amounts of evolved O2 gases were measured during photocurrent stability measurement in a sealed electrolytic tank, which was evacuated and filled with Ar. To measure the amounts of O2 gas, we extracted 1 ml gas from the sealed electrolytic tank per 30 min, and then injected the gas into a gas chromatography column (GC2060, Shanghai RAMI Instrument Co., Ltd).
3. Results and discussion
The α-Fe2O3 sample that was untreated with In3+ in the reaction solution was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis, as shown in Fig. 1a. It shows ordered nanosheets vertically growing on the FTO substrates with a diameter of around 220 nm and a thickness of about 15 nm. Moreover, the hematite nanosheets stacked seriously on the FTO substrate. More SEM images for the hematite nanosheet arrays are presented in Fig. S1 and S2 (see the ESI†).

In an initial attempt to prepare an In3+-doped Fe2O3 photoanode, we introduced In(NO3)3·4.5H2O into the precursor solution with potassium hexacyanoferrate(II) trihydrate and ammonia water, maintaining the other parameters the same. To our surprise, careful energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis repeatedly demonstrated the absence of In element in the In3+-treated hematite nanosheets (Fig. S3, see the ESI†). Additionally, after the treatment with In3+, the size and thickness of the hematite nanosheets changed little with a diameter of around 210 nm and a thickness of about 15 nm under SEM observation (Fig. 1b). However, the aligned stacking of the hematite nanosheets was clearly reduced on the FTO glass substrate compared with those nanosheets untreated with In3+. The reduced stacking removed the attachment between the planar surfaces of neighboring nanosheets, and would expose more active surface areas. It is beneficial for enhancing light absorption and increasing photoelectrode/electrolyte junctions in PEC catalysis.
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed to characterize the crystal structure and composition of the samples. The XRD patterns of the untreated α-Fe2O3 and the In3+-treated Fe2O3 nanosheets are shown in Fig. 1c. Apart from some distinguishable diffraction peaks belonging to the FTO substrate, untreated and In3+-treated α-Fe2O3 exhibited the same diffraction peaks, which can be well indexed to the hexagonal α-Fe2O3 (JCPDS no. 73-0603). Fig. 1d shows the precise XRD scan patterns of the samples’ (110) diffraction peak, demonstrating that there was nearly no change in the position of the (110) peak. It is known that the XRD peak location would shift a little when host doping occurred due to the distortion of the lattice. This can be considered as one of the pieces of evidence for the absence of In3+ ions in the hematite lattice after the treatment with In3+.
High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) observations were performed to further acquire the microscopic structure information of the In3+-treated α-Fe2O3 nanosheets. Fig. 1e shows the HRTEM image obtained by electron-beam penetrating the planar hematite nanosheet surface. It exhibits clear lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.25 nm and 0.41 nm, which were indexed to the (1 1 −1/2 0) and (1 −1 0 0) planes of hexagonal hematite phase. Therefore, the direction of the electron-beam penetrating was [001], and the exposed planar surface of the hematite nanosheet was {001} (Fig. S7, see the ESI†). The corresponding selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 1f) shows concentric rings composed of bright discrete diffraction spots, indicating the polycrystalline nature of the prepared hematite nanosheets.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was further conducted to verify the chemical composition of the In3+-treated α-Fe2O3 nanosheets. The XPS survey spectrum of the sample treated with In3+ (Fig. 2a) shows Fe, O, and C elements, with no clear In element signals detected in it. The other peaks, which are not marked, most likely originate from the FTO substrate and adsorbed adventitious carbon species, respectively. Fig. 2b shows the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Fe element in the sample. The binding energies of 711.2 eV and 724.7 eV are attributed to the Fe 2p3/2 line and Fe 2p1/2 line of the In3+-treated α-Fe2O3 nanosheets, respectively.48 A satellite peak of the Fe 2p3/2 main line is observed at approximately 719.3 eV, i.e., approximately 8.1 eV below the main line.13 This satellite is most likely indicative of the presence of Fe3+ species,49 confirming the composition of α-Fe2O3 nanosheets. Fig. 2c shows the high-resolution XPS spectrum of O 1s. The peak at 529.3 eV is assigned to the oxygen in the lattice.50 The binding energies above 532.1 eV illustrated the presence of some adsorbed organic species.51 To further confirm the absence of In3+ in the prepared α-Fe2O3 lattice after treating with In3+, a high-resolution fitted XPS spectrum between 460–440 eV was also obtained, which is the location range of 3d peaks of In3+. However, as shown in Fig. 2d, no clear signals of 3d peaks for In3+ can be detected, validating that In3+ did not interfere with the hematite.

All the above characterization studies including EDX, XRD and XPS analyses confirmed that In3+ ions did not incorporate into the prepared Fe2O3 nanosheets to bring ion doping in the present synthesis system. The reason for doping to not occur in our work was attributed to the Fe source of potassium hexacyanoferrate(II) trihydrate, which was decomposed alone into Fe2O3 adsorbed on the FTO glass surface. To illustrate this deduction, we used Zn2+ and Zr4+ ions for substituting the In3+ ions to prepare the hematite under the same conditions in our system. The EDX results of the Fe2O3 products showed that doping of Zn2+ or Zr4+ also did not occur (Fig. S4 and S5, see the ESI†), confirming that the potassium hexacyanoferrate(II) was decomposed onto the substrate alone. However, iron(III) chloride (FeCl3) was chosen to substitute for potassium hexacyanoferrate(II) as the Fe source to prepare Fe2O3 with In3+ under the same conditions. The obtained hematite was characterized by EDX analyses (Fig. S6, see the ESI†), which clearly showed that the doped In element was present in the hematite product as expected. Therefore, the Fe source in our synthesis system was responsible for the absence of In ions in the hematite sheet lattice.
Although In3+ ions did not incorporate into the Fe2O3 nanosheets, they indeed changed nanosheet alignment on FTO as discussed above. We infer that the effect of In3+ on this change was attributed to the adsorption of In3+ on the planar surface of nanosheets. As illustrated in Scheme 2a, electrostatic repulsion between every two neighboring nanosheets with In3+ adsorption reduced the stacking of the hematite nanosheets. Herein, a model as shown in Schemes 2b and c was constructed in order to elucidate the atomic structure of the In3+ ion adsorbed on the surface of the nanosheet (see the Experimental section). The calculation indicates that the two-dimensional structure also has the anti-ferromagnetic configuration. The surface energy (compared to the bulk structure) is 0.10 eV per Å2. The positive value implies that the surface is active with low stability. Further increasing the vacuum layer does not change this value. Finally, a 2 × 2 two-dimensional supercell (Scheme 2b and c) was constructed for the adsorption of the In3+ ion. In this structure, the oxygen atoms with negative electricity exposed more than Fe atoms of positive electricity in the (001) plane, which is the planar surface of the hematite nanosheet. Moreover, the distance of the In3+ ion images is larger than 10 Å (the unit cell parameter is 10.08 Å) so that the influence from the image atoms is avoided. After optimizing the position of the In3+ ion, a favorable model was obtained. Schemes 2b and c show that the In3+ ion makes three bonds with the three oxygen atoms in the top layer, and the bond length is calculated to be 2.33 Å. This provides an atomic model of the In3+ ion adsorbed on the surface of the nanosheet.

To further confirm our hypothesis, we tried to characterize the In3+ in the product by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Unexpectedly, the ICP-MS result detected In3+ and showed the 1.91% molar ratio of In to Fe atoms. However, after being washed one more time, the molar ratio of In to Fe atoms in the product decreased to 0.55%. This demonstrates well that the very few In3+ ions in our product detected by ICP-MS should be caused by their adsorption on the surface of Fe2O3 nanosheets rather than lattice incorporation. In addition, nanosheet stacking can still be observed for the sample treated with low-valence metal Zn(II) ions as shown in Fig. S3.† In contrast, high-valence metal ions of In(III) and Zr(IV) can greatly reduce nanosheet stacking (Fig. S4†). This indicates well that preventing the aligned nanosheet stacking was related to the electrostatic repulsion of the adsorbed metallic ions because high-valence metal ions have stronger electrostatic repulsion than low-valence metal ions.
Among all steps of the PEC water splitting, light absorption is undoubtedly the most basic one. The UV-vis spectra of the untreated and In3+-treated α-Fe2O3 samples grown on FTO substrates are shown in Fig. 3a. It was seen that the ability of light absorption of In3+-treated α-Fe2O3 nanosheets is much better than that of the untreated α-Fe2O3 sample, especially in the visible light range (390–760 nm wavelength). This can be attributable to the fact that the In3+-treated hematite nanosheets exposed much more surface to absorb light illumination induced by the reduced nanosheet stacking. Moreover, the space between the loose nanosheets can also increase the photon–matter interaction via multiple reflection and scattering at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface.27 The plots of dT/dλ versus wavelength (Fig. 3b), which were translated from the UV-vis spectra, were used to acquire the optical band gap of the α-Fe2O3 samples through the equation: Eg = 1240/λmax.52 Here λmax is the wavelength value corresponding to the maximum of dT/dλ. The most intense peaks of the In3+-treated and untreated α-Fe2O3 film lie at 584 and 563 nm. The band gap can be calculated to be 2.12 and 2.2 eV respectively, which are in good accordance with the reported band gap (1.9–2.2 eV).53 Moreover, the band gap indicated a little decrease after the In3+ treatment, although In3+ was not present in the hematite lattice. The decrease should be caused by the slight change in the surface structure and grain boundaries of the prepared polycrystalline hematite nanosheets, which can affect the optical band gap structure.54

To explore the PEC performance of the untreated and In3+-treated α-Fe2O3 nanosheets, both of them were measured as photoanodes in a 1.0 M NaOH electrolyte solution using a three-electrode electrochemical cell. At a power density of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G), the current density and bias voltage (J–V) curves with the photo-response are shown in Fig. 4a for the two α-Fe2O3 photoanodes. The photocurrent density of the untreated α-Fe2O3 film was about 0.25 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, and then reached 0.52 mA cm−2 at a bias of 1.7 V vs. RHE. The photo-response curve for the hematite nanosheet array treated with In3+ in the reaction solution (as 15% content of the Fe source) is also shown in Fig. 4a. The photocurrent density increased to 0.65 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which was about 2.6 times as high as that of the untreated α-Fe2O3 photoanode. Then, it reached a higher photocurrent density of 1.26 mA cm−2 at 1.7 V vs. RHE. Furthermore, both the curves display that the photocurrent sharply increased when the light was switched on, and immediately returned to its initial state after the light source was turned off. The rapid and reversible photocurrent responses can be observed for each switching of on and off. This also confirmed that the obtained current density in the PEC tests originated from the light illumination.

In addition, we tested the PEC performance of hematite photoanodes obtained by the one-time hydrothermal process as shown in Fig. 4b, which shows relatively much lower photocurrent density than the photoanodes with a two-time process. We also explored the effects of different amounts of In(NO3)3·4.5H2O added in a precursor solution on their PEC performance. Fig. 4c indicates the photocurrent density curves of the hematite nanosheets that were treated with In3+ with different contents in the reaction solutions. The photocurrent densities of the In3+-treated samples were all enhanced compared with the untreated hematite, and reached the highest intensity when the In3+ content was 15% as the Fe source in the solution. To further improve the PEC water oxidation, a usual OER cocatalyst, cobalt phosphate (Co–Pi), was deposited on the prepared In-treated hematite photoanode surface by photo-assisted electrodeposition.55,56 After Co–Pi was loaded onto the In-treated photoanodes, the optical transparent and UV-vis spectrum of the photoanodes showed nearly no change (Fig. S9†). As shown in Fig. 4d, the photocurrent density of the In-treated/Co–Pi photoanode increased to ∼1.0 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, and reached ∼2.0 mA cm−2 at 1.68 V vs. RHE.
Photocurrent stability is extremely crucial for the future practical applications of photoelectrode materials. Consequently, the stability of the In3+-treated α-Fe2O3 electrode was tested with the comparison of the untreated hematite. Fig. 5a shows the stability of J–t curves under the irradiation of 100 mW cm−2 for 4.5 hours. A slight decay is shown at the very start of the performance for the In3+-treated α-Fe2O3 photoanode. However, after 30 min of illumination, the photocurrent of the In3+-treated photoanode was quite stable at ∼600 μA cm−2 and about 92.3% of the initial photocurrent density was preserved. In contrast, the untreated hematite retained 76.0% of the initial photocurrent density. The results demonstrate that the In3+-treated hematite photoanode displayed suitable stability in the PEC water splitting test.

(c) IPCE spectra of these two films collected at 1.23 V vs. RHE; (d) solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiencies. 
During the stability measurement, the amount and rate of producing oxygen gas from the α-Fe2O3 nanosheet photoanodes were measured during PEC water splitting. The amounts of evolved oxygen gas per 30 min are shown as dots in Fig. 5b. It shows the rate of oxygen production as about 5.76 μmol cm−2 h−1 and 1.60 μmol cm−2 h−1 for the In3+-treated and untreated hematite nanosheets, respectively. The rate of O2 production for the In3+-treated sample was 3.6 times as high as that of the sample without treatment in the measured 4.5 hours. At the same time, the theoretical amount of O2 gas was calculated by integrating the photocurrent over time and considering a four-electron process for oxygen evolution. Fig. 5b shows that the theoretical value (shown as lines) and experimental value (shown as dots) almost occur simultaneously. From these data, an overall faradaic efficiency of ∼100% for oxygen evolution was estimated for the In3+-treated hematite nanosheets, which is much higher than the 94.97% of the untreated sample (the detailed calculation process is shown in the ESI†).
To confirm the improvement in the PEC performance of the α-Fe2O3 films induced by In3+ treatment, the incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was further evaluated. Fig. 5c shows the IPCE profiles for the untreated and In3+-treated α-Fe2O3 films illuminated by visible-light (400–800 nm wavelength). It shows a similar trend depending on the wavelength of the incident light in the visible-light range. With the wavelength longer than 610 nm, the IPCE values almost drop to zero, in accordance with the band gap of the α-Fe2O3 semiconductor. However, compared with the untreated α-Fe2O3 film, the In3+-treated films show a remarkable enhancement in IPCE values over the entire wavelength range. Most notably, the IPCE value in the wavelength range from 560 to 440 nm was increased rapidly from 2.1% to 16.5% at 1.23 V vs. RHE after In3+ treatment. However, the untreated α-Fe2O3 photoanode presented a slow increase trend throughout the whole spectrum, as shown in Fig. 5c. In the wavelength range from 460 to 400 nm, both values tended to be stable and reached the maximum value, which is 16.5% and 5.0% for the In3+-treated and untreated α-Fe2O3 photoanodes, respectively.
The overall solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiencies of PEC cells for photoanodes were also investigated. Using the photocurrent density from 1 sun AM 1.5 simulated solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2), the overall solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiencies of the single-junction PEC process can be calculated from equation (2): (2)where J is the photocurrent density at any potential, Vapp is the potential applied on the photoanode, Plight is the intensity of illumination and ηF is the Faraday efficiency. Here, J was collected from the LSV plot under chopped light, Plight = 100 mW cm−2, ηF was 100% and 94.97% for the untreated and In-treated as mentioned above. The ηSTH(%) was achieved at various potentials as shown in Fig. 5d. It clearly shows that the ηSTH(%) of the In-treated sample was much higher than that of the untreated hematite photoanode.
We further measured the electrochemical impedance of the untreated and In3+-treated α-Fe2O3 films in the dark. Fig. 6a shows the calculated Mott–Schottky plots, which are related to the interface properties between the active material and electrolyte. It is known that Mott–Schottky plots can give the information about the charge carrier concentration (Nd) and the flat-band potential (VFB) through the Mott–Schottky equation (3): (3)where C is the capacitance per unit area, q is the elementary charge, ε is the dielectric constant of hematite, ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum, Nd is the charge carrier density, V is the electrode applied potential, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature. Both samples in the Mott–Schottky curves show a positive slope in the Mott–Schottky plots, indicating that they are n-type semiconductors with electrons as majority carriers. At the same time, the flat-band potential can be obtained from the abscissa intercept from the linear part of Mott–Schottky plots.57 The values of the flat-band potential for the untreated and In3+-treated α-Fe2O3 films are 0.88 and 0.76 V as shown in Fig. 6a, respectively. For typical n-type semiconductors, the Fermi level (EF) is located close to the conduction band minimum. In (photo) electrochemistry, EF is equivalent to the flat-band potential (VFB) when band bending at the semiconductor surface disappears.58Fig. 6a displays an observed negative shift for the flat band, which means that In-treatment raised the Fermi level of the α-Fe2O3 film and electron redox. The slopes determined from the Mott–Schottky plots were used to estimate the carrier densities. The carrier densities can be calculated as: (4)

With the ε value of 80 for α-Fe2O3,59 the electron densities of the untreated and In3+-treated α-Fe2O3 films were calculated to be 3.7 × 1018 cm−3 and 2.0 × 1019 cm−3, respectively. The In3+-treatment thus led to an increase of one order of magnitude in the carrier density of α-Fe2O3 films. The increase in carrier density upon In3+-treatment improved the conductivity, and thereby the collection efficiency of photo-generated electrons enhanced. In addition, considering the above band gap from Fig. 6b, the n-type semiconductor's Fermi level is close to the bottom of the conduction band.60 The band gaps of the untreated and In3+-treated α-Fe2O3 films were estimated as shown in Fig. 6b. The increased carrier density is expected to improve the electrical conductivity of the hematite nanosheet array,16 and therefore it reduces the electrode internal resistance and the voltage drop at the interface between the hematite and the FTO substrate.
To confirm the enhancement of carrier density, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements for the In-treated and untreated samples were performed as shown in Fig. 7a. The In-treated hematite electrode clearly shows a smaller radius than that of the untreated α-Fe2O3 electrode. The inset of Fig. 7a shows the equivalent circuit used to fit the EIS data. Significantly, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the hematite electrode was considerably reduced from ∼11 kΩ to ∼5.4 kΩ after the treatment with In3+. To explain the improvement by the In3+ treatment, we measured its electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), which was estimated from the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) by measuring its cyclic voltammograms (CVs) in a non-Faradaic region (0.926–1.026 V vs. RHE) without illumination. The Cdl value of the In-treated and untreated hematite electrodes is found to be 128.9 and 100.9 μF cm−2, respectively (Fig. S11 and S12†). The result indicated that the In-treated hematite had a larger electrochemically active surface area and more active sites.

Surface charge separation efficiency (ηsurf) for the untreated and In3+-treated samples (d). 
The efficiencies of surface charge separation for the untreated and In3+-treated α-Fe2O3 nanosheets were also measured by using H2O2 as a hole scavenger.61 For n-type semiconductor electrode materials, a fast hole scavenger, H2O2, is often added to the electrolyte to explore the charge separation from the photoanode surface towards water molecules for oxidation. Because the rate of charge (hole) transfer by the oxidation of H2O2 at the n-semiconductor/electrolyte interface is very fast, it can be assumed that the surface charge separation efficiency is nearly 100% (ηsurf (H2O2) ≈ 100%). As shown in Fig. 7b and c, we measured the J–V curves in the electrolyte with and without H2O2, respectively. When H2O2 was added to the electrolyte, the photocurrent density was increased, which was attributable to its high rapid kinetics of H2O2 photooxidation. Moreover, the charge separation efficiencies on the surface of the untreated and In3+-treated hematite thin-film photoanodes were estimated as shown in Fig. 7d. We calculated these charge separation efficiencies for water oxidation by using eqn (5): ηsurf = JH2O/JH2O2(5)
From Fig. 7d, we can see that ηsurf values are 46% and 70% for the untreated and In3+-treated samples at 1.23 V vs. RHE, respectively. Moreover, the ηsurf value for the In3+-treated hematite photoanode is nearly two times as that of the untreated hematite at the potentials higher than 1.3 V versus RHE.
Furthermore, the photocurrent density arising from the practical PEC water oxidation for photoanodes can be expressed according to previous reports as follows:62 Jwater = Jtheory × ηabs × ηtrans × ηsurf(6)
where Jwater and Jtheory are the measured and theoretical photocurrent density of photoanode materials respectively; ηabs is the efficiency of light absorption; ηtrans is the efficiency of the inner charge transfer of the materials; ηsurf is the efficiency of surface charge separation. The efficiency ratio of the charge transfer for the In-treated and untreated hematite photoanodes at 1.23 V vs. RHE can be determined using eqn (7): (7)
where  and Juntreatedwater are 0.65 and 0.25 mA cm−2, respectively;  and ηuntreatedsurf are 70% and 46%, respectively;  is calculated to be approximately 1.5, estimated from the absorption spectra of the In-treated and untreated samples integrating over the AM 1.5G spectrum (Fig. S13, see the ESI†).63 Therefore, the efficiency ratio value of the charge transfer is determined to be 1.14 at the potential of 1.23 V vs. RHE, indicating that the charge transfer efficiency of the photoanode materials enhanced approximately 14% when the hematite nanosheets were treated with In ions.
To gain a deeper insight into the PEC performance of the prepared hematite samples, we investigated the lifetime of the electron recombination. The lifetime of the charge carriers could be evaluated by measuring the open circuit voltage (VOC) decay,64 which was recorded by turning off the light rapidly after achieving a steady state under illumination. As indicated in Fig. 8a, the positive decay of the VOC demonstrated n-type electronic conduction in both samples,65 consistent with the results of the Mott–Schottky measurements. The VOC decay rate (dVOC/dt) is slower for the In-treated hematite photoanodes compared with the untreated sample. Since the starting VOC values of these samples were not at the same level, the VOC values were normalized for a better comparison as shown in Fig. 8b.66 The electron lifetime, τn, could be extracted from the linear part of the enlarged VOC decay diagram (Fig. 8c) on the basis of equation (8):67 τn = −KB·T/e(dVOC/dt)−1.(8)
 Fig. 8  (a) Open circuit potential (OCP) decay diagram recorded by turning off the light at the steady state under illumination. (b) Normalized OCP decay diagram; (c) enlarged OCP decay diagram of (a). 
The electron lifetimes were determined to be 0.025 s and 0.15 s respectively, for the untreated and In-treated hematite photoanodes. The longer electron lifetime indicated more rapid charge transfer, and made electrons possible to travel longer distances without charge recombination.
4. Conclusion
In summary, we have successfully improved the PEC performance of α-Fe2O3 nanosheets on a FTO substrate through a treatment with In3+ ions. We found that In3+ in the precursor solution did not enter into the lattice of the freestanding α-Fe2O3 nanosheets, which was proved by multi-analyses of XRD, EDX and XPS spectra. The In3+ treatment did not change the morphology and size of the hematite nanosheets. However, the electrostatic repulsion caused by the adsorbed In3+ reduced nanosheet stacking on the substrate, and increased the active area for PEC catalysis. The In3+-treated α-Fe2O3 exhibited clearly enhanced performance for PEC water splitting, including higher photocurrent density (enhanced 2.6 times) and excellent stability, much superior to the untreated α-Fe2O3 nanosheets. The measured amounts of O2 were close to the theoretical amounts with an evolution rate of ∼5.76 μmol h−1 (1.23 V vs. RHE), and the Faradaic efficiency was nearly 100%. Furthermore, the efficiency of surface charge separation after In3+ treatment was nearly enhanced two times. This work demonstrates that the In3+ ion in the synthetic environment, which is not doped into the hematite lattice, can also improve the PEC activities of the hematite nanosheet array. The effect of In3+ was deduced to slightly tune the appearance of the hematite film, increase light absorption in the visible light range (390–760 nm wavelength), and increase the contact area between the electrode and electrolyte as well as the carrier density in the semiconductor.
