These co-doped novel nanocomposite structures displayed a significantly enhanced photoresponse compared with a single doping or sensitization strategy. This enhancement was attributed to the double synergistic effect of N doping of TiO2, which facilitated hole transfer/transport from the sensitizers to TiO2 via oxygen vacancy states mediated by the N and Mn doping that created electronic states in the CdS mid-gap region, thus altering the charge separation and recombination dynamics in addition to tuning the optical properties. Photoluminescence spectrometry and monitoring of the yield of active hydroxyl radicals on irradiation supported the presence of this double synergistic effect.
Introduction
Nanomaterials have attracted much attention in many disciplines as a result of their novel electronic, magnetic, optical, chemical and mechanical properties.1,2 TiO2-based nanomaterials have been intensively investigated due to their excellent corrosion resistance, environmentally friendly properties, biocompatibility, good photocatalytic activity, good accessibility and moderate cost.3 Numerous and diverse applications based on TiO2 nanomaterials have been developed, such as photovoltaic cells/photoelectrochemical cells, the photocatalytic degradation of pollutants, biosensing and drug-delivery systems.4–7 Many methods have been developed to prepare well-organized TiO2-based nanostructures using Ti sheets.8,9 Because hydrothermal growth is a sensitive dissolution–regrowth process with a thermodynamic equilibrium, it is possible to produce large amounts of novel nanomaterials through continuous growth.10 For example, Peng et al.11 have prepared various TiO2 nanostructures, including nanoplate arrays, nanowire arrays and continuous nanowire network films. Shao et al.12 used similar hierarchical TiO2 nanomaterials (microflowers consisting of nanobelt building blocks) to fabricate high-performance dye-sensitized solar cells. These examples indicate the importance of controlling the shape and structure of TiO2 nanomaterials because both these characteristics not only determine the performance, but also the area of application. However, the photoconversion performance of TiO2 is limited to <2.2% under AM 1.5 global solar illumination as a result of its large band gap energy (3.0 eV for rutile and 3.2 eV for anatase). Therefore extending the working spectrum of TiO2-based nanomaterials to include more of the visible and even the NIR region of the electromagnetic spectrum is of great interest.
Recent efforts have focused on modifying the valence band of TiO2 by incorporating non-metal ions such as C, S, H or N.13–16 The p states of the non-metal foreign ions usually form impurity states above the valence band or hybridize with the O 2p states, thus shifting the valence band edge of TiO2 upwards and then narrowing the band gap, inducing a noticeable enhancement in the absorption of visible and even NIR radiation. Hoang et al.17 reported a synergistic effect involving co-treatment of TiO2 nanowire arrays via hydrogenation and nitridation, which improved the performance of the photo-oxidation of water under visible light illumination. They suggested that the interaction between the N-dopant and Ti3+ was the key to the extension of the active spectrum and the superior photo-oxidation of water under visible light irradiation of the hydrogenation and nitridation co-treated TiO2 nanowire arrays.
Sensitizing TiO2 with small band gap semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) is another attractive method for increasing their absorption of visible light. Under these conditions, the optimum QDs have a conduction band edge that is higher than that of TiO2 so that the photogenerated electrons in the QDs are easily injected into the conduction band of TiO2. Santra et al.18 first succeeded in doping CdS QDs films with Mn2+ to design high-efficiency solar cells. This study marked an important milestone in overcoming the barrier of achieving a power conversion efficiency >5%. Similarly, Zhang et al.19 recently developed a facile strategy for preparing nitrogen-doped carbon dots. They then used these dots as photosensitizers to modify a porous TiO2 inverse opal structure, which demonstrated a better photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic performance than that of the carbon dots. Hensel et al.20 combined doping with non-metal ions and sensitization with small band gap QDs and reported the synthesis and photoelectrochemical studies of TiO2 nanoparticles and nanowires simultaneously doped with N and sensitized with CdSe QDs. They observed a significant enhancement in the photoresponse in these nanocomposites compared with TiO2 sensitized with TiO2–N or CdS QDs, which was attributed to the synergistic effect of CdS sensitization and N doping that facilitated hole transfer/transport from CdS to TiO2 through oxygen vacancy states (Vo) mediated by N doping. Cheng et al.21 also demonstrated a remarkable synergistic effect of CdS sensitization and N doping with highly ordered and periodically inverse opal nanostructures TiO2.
Both the doping and sensitization of TiO2 have been explored separately for solar energy conversion applications, but little work has been carried out on combining these two approaches, e.g. modifying TiO2 nanomaterials (doped by non-metal ions) with QDs (doped by transition metal ions). In this work, we report the development of TiO2 nanostructures doped by N and sensitized with CdS–Mn QDs for photoelectrochemical applications with a substantially enhanced photocurrent response. A significant double synergistic effect between the CdS–Mn QDs and TiO2–N was observed.
Experimental details
Preparation of photoelectrodes
Sodium titanate nanostructures were synthesized via an alkaline hydrothermal growth process.10 Titanium foil (1 × 4 cm) was ultrasonically cleaned for 5 min in a mixed solution of deionized water and ethanol (1:1) and then placed in a 100 ml Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave filled with 50 ml of a 4 M solution of NaOH. The autoclave was stored inside an electric oven at different temperatures for different durations of time. After hydrothermal growth, the solution was no longer clear and contained light gray precipitates. The titanium foil removed from the autoclave had lost its metallic luster and its color had become light gray. The titanium foil, now covered with nanostructures, was immersed in 50 ml of a 0.6 M solution of HCl for 1 h to exchange Na+ with H+. The titanium foil was then removed from the HCl solution and rinsed with copious amounts of ultrapure water and dried in an N2 atmosphere. The dry titanium foil covered with nanostructures was then annealed for 3 h at 500 °C at a heating and cooling rate of 2 °C min−1. The color of the film became white after calcination.
TiO2–N photoelectrodes were prepared by annealing anatase TiO2 under a flow of NH3 at 300, 400 or 500 °C for 30 min. The atomic percentage for all N species found in an N-doped TiO2 sample was <2%.20 After annealing in ammonia, the color of the TiO2 photoelectrodes became pale yellow, suggesting the incorporation of N-introduced band gap states of TiO2 and thereby enhanced absorption of visible light.
To prepare the TiO2–N photoelectrodes sensitized with CdS–Mn QDs, pure TiO2 photoelectrodes were first doped with N and then modified with CdS–Mn QDs using the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method.18 A 0.1 M solution of cadmium nitrate in methanol was used as the cation source and 0.1 M sodium sulfide in 1:1 methanol and water as the anion source. To incorporate the doping of Mn2+, manganese acetate (0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1 or 0.125 M) was mixed with cadmium nitrate. This allowed the co-adsorption of Mn2+ and Cd2+ ions, which, in turn, facilitated the incorporation of Mn2+ into the CdS QDs. Each cycle of SILAR consisted of the successive immersion of the TiO2–N in the metal ion and sulfide anion solutions for 1 min each.
Annealing was investigated as a method of changing the nature of the coating because it can change the dot size and crystallinity CdS–Mn, or as a method to improve the interfacial contact between TiO2–N and CdS–Mn.22 Annealing was carried out under an N2 atmosphere at 300 °C for 30 min to avoid any possible degradation from O2 or moisture in the atmosphere.
Characterization of photoelectrodes
The crystal structure of the TiO2 nanostructure array films formed on the titanium foil was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a D8 Advance (Bruker) instrument with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å). The evolution of the morphology of different nanostructures was investigated at various stages of the synthesis using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Hitachi S-4800). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) (JEOL JEM 2100) were used to characterize the typical morphology of the TiO2 and sensitizers. An energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) attachment fitted to the scanning electron microscope was used for elemental analysis. Photoluminescence spectrometry (PL) and UV-visible absorption spectrophotometry measurements were recorded by an F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi) and a UV-3600 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu), respectively. The UV-visible absorption spectra shown in Fig. 1, S1 and S2† were obtained on an Agilent Cary 300 instrument.
 Fig. 1  TiO2 nanomaterials were prepared by hydrothermal process under different reaction conditions. (A), (B) and (C): 200 °C and 4 h with NaOH concentrations increasing from 1 M, 2 M to 4 M; (D), (E) and (F): 150 °C and 4 h with NaOH concentrations increasing from 1 M, 2 M to 4 M. 
Photoelectrochemical measurements
Photoelectrochemical characterization was carried out in an aqueous solution of 0.35 M Na2SO3 and 0.24 M Na2S (pH 11.5) using a CHI electrochemical analyzer (CHI660E, Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co. Ltd) in a standard three-electrode system consisting of an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, a Pt counter electrode and the sample electrode. The electrolyte was purged with N2 gas before measurement. The incident light from a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE-300UV) matched the AM 1.5G spectrum with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2.
Photoreactivity measurements
Hydroxyl radicals (OH·) produced by the as-prepared photoelectrodes under illumination were detected by fluorescence spectrometry using terephthalic acid as the probe molecule. Before exposure to light irradiation, the suspension was purged with N2 gas in the dark for 30 min. During the photoreaction, no oxygen was bubbled into the suspension. The change in OH· concentration was monitored by determining the fluorescence emission intensity at an excitation wavelength of 320 nm. The light source used in the photoreaction was similar to that used in the photoelectrochemical measurements.
Results and discussion
Characterization and performance assay of TiO2 nanostructure photoelectrodes
Under the typical hydrothermal conditions (4 M NaOH solution, 250 °C, 3 h), oriented multilayered nanowire arrays with diameters of tens of nanometers and lengths of several micrometers were easily obtained (Fig. S1†). This structure may be a result of the presence of dislocations and defects during the growth of the nanowires; when the nanowires were long enough, the defect strain was sufficient to transform the nanowires into multilayered structures.24 We then reduced the reaction temperature to 200 °C for 4 h in 1, 2 and 4 M NaOH solutions. Accordingly, the shapes of the nanostructures will evolve from nanoleaves coupled with sparse nanowires (Fig. 1A), nanoleaves mixed with nanowires (Fig. 1B) into nanowires (Fig. 1C). But these newly-forming network nanowires in Fig. 1C are obvious shorter than that in Fig. S1.† At a lower temperature (150 °C), the TiO2 nanostructures showed a similar evolution in shape as the concentration of the NaOH solution increased, but the main product was nanoleaves (Fig. 1D–F). The UV-visible absorption spectra of the nanoleaf arrays (Fig. 1D) and nanowire/nanoleaf arrays (Fig. 1F) are given in Fig. S1.† The SEM images and UV-visible absorption spectra of typical nanowire arrays are shown in Fig. S2.†
These results showed that the morphology of the synthesized nanomaterials was strongly dependent on the concentration of the NaOH solution, the reaction temperature and the duration of the reaction: a high temperature favored the growth of nanowires and a low temperature favored the growth of nanoleaves. The nanowires that grew directly on the mesoporous TiO2 layer were perpendicular to it at high temperatures (Fig. S2A†), whereas those originating from nanoleaves tended to be entangled at low temperatures (Fig. S3,† high magnification image in Fig. 1F).25 Thus it can be speculated that the tip morphology of the nanowires continued to change as the reaction time increased. Fig. S4† shows a large number of spherical flower-like nanostructures on the top of the different nanostructure arrays; these spherical nanomaterials spread over the nanowire film with increasing time (not shown). More importantly, these nanoflowers grew directly on the nanowire array film (Fig. S4B†), rather than by physical adsorption. It was very difficult to remove them from the substrate by washing. The mechanism of formation of the TiO2 nanostructures is discussed in the ESI.†
The crystallographic structures of the different TiO2 nanostructures were confirmed by powder XRD analysis (Fig. 2). All the diffraction peaks were unambiguously assigned to anatase TiO2 (JCPDS card no. 21-1272).26 The increase in temperature and duration of reaction promoted continuous growth and a shift in the anatase peak at 25.29°. This is similar to previously reported data.27,28

(B) indicates enlarged area in (A). As a reference anatase (JCPDS no. 21-1272) is plotted. The cross-star asterisks indicate the Ti foil. 
The photoelectrochemical performance, including light harvesting and the photocurrent response ability, are shown in Fig. S1, S2 and S4.† The TiO2 nanostructures displayed an obvious photoresponse in the ultraviolet region and no difference in the light absorption efficiency was observed among these nanostructures in this region. The hierarchical and hybrid structures had a better photoresponse in the visible region. The photocurrent responses of these nanostructures are consistent with their light absorption properties, namely higher light absorption results in a superior photoresponse. The photocurrent densities for nanowire/nanoleaf arrays (Fig. 1F), nanowire/nanoleaf/nanoflower arrays (Fig. S4B†), nanoleaf arrays (Fig. 1D) and nanowire arrays (Fig. S2B†) were 0.53, 0.51, 0.44, and 0.37 mA cm−2, respectively (Fig. 3). We selected the novel nanowire/nanoleaf arrays as the basic photoelectrode for sensitization and doping.

Characterization and evaluation of photoelectrochemical performance of the co-sensitization/doping photoelectrodes
Fig. 4 shows the TEM and HRTEM images of the as-prepared photoelectrodes. To characterize the shape of the naked TiO2 nanowire/nanoleaf array photoelectrode (TiO2) and the TiO2–N nanowire/nanoleaf array photoelectrode sensitized with CdS–Mn QDs (TiO2–N/CdS–Mn), two thin layer samples were dissolved in ethanol with ultrasonic dispersion for 30 min. Then a few milliliters of the samples were dropped onto two copper grids for imaging. Many TEM and HRTEM images based on TiO2 nanowires are available.10,25 We chose a typical TiO2 nanoleaf from the TiO2 nanowire/nanoleaf array to image on a copper grid (Fig. 4A). The lattice spacing was 0.35 nm, corresponding to the (101) plane of anatase TiO2. There was no continuous lattice plane on the surface as a result of the rugged surface features of the nanoleaf. Fig. 4B shows a typical area of CdS–Mn QDs sensitization of the TiO2–N nanostructure on the copper grid. Fig. 4C is a high magnification image of a single nanowire. These images clearly show that the naked TiO2 surface was fully covered with the sensitizers. These closely packed sensitizers improved the carrier transport without space barriers. Fig. 4D is an HRTEM image of Fig. 4C. The lattice spacing of 0.35 nm corresponds to TiO2 on which the CdS–Mn QDs were well anchored. The lattice spacing of 0.29 nm corresponds to the (200) plane of CdS. Mn doping could not be confirmed by HRTEM. The EDS spectrum fitted to the SEM image (Fig. 4E) reveals the characteristic peaks of O, S, Cd, Ti and Mn. Elemental analysis showed that the CdS–Mn QDs had an atomic ratio of approximately 1:1:0.06 (S:Cd:Mn) in agreement with the concentration ratio of the cations and anions during the SILAR process.

Fig. 5A and B show the UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra and corresponding Tauc plots of the photoelectrodes. The band gap was estimated according to the formula:19(αhν)1/2 = A(hν − Eg)where α is the light absorption coefficient, A is a constant, h is Planck's constant, ν is the frequency of light and Eg is the band gap energy. The naked TiO2 photoelectrode absorbed only UV light (<390 nm) as a result of its large band gap of 3.1 eV. The slightly increased absorption of visible light by TiO2–N (Eg = 3.07 eV) is attributed to the excitation of electrons from the No levels (substitutional N doping at O sites) to the localized electronic levels of Vo. The incorporation of CdS QDs onto TiO2 significantly extends the absorption spectrum into the visible region. The absorption spectra of CdS/TiO2 shows the onset of absorption around 500 nm. Fig. 5A (curves c–f) shows an increase in the absorbance with increasing numbers of SILAR cycles (7 to 13 cycles), as well as red shifts in the absorption shoulder and the onset position from 2.23 to 2.16 eV. These results indicate that more CdS QDs are incorporated into the TiO2 matrix during the SILAR process and that the size of the CdS QDs increases after the SILAR process. With an increase in the number of SILAR cycles, the absorbance increases more quickly in the early cycles, slows down gradually, and only a small increase is observed after 13 cycles (data not shown). The higher increase in absorbance in the early cycles is attributed to the higher surface area of the TiO2 available for adsorption, which simultaneously causes the growth of the CdS films. The surface area of the TiO2 decreased gradually due to the anchoring of CdS and the blocking of the spaces in the TiO2.29 It has been shown previously that it is possible to modify the electronic and photophysical properties of CdS QDs by doping with optically active transition metal ions (Mn2+).18 The dopant creates electronic states in the mid-gap region of the CdS QDs, thus altering the charge separation and recombination dynamics. Mn–CdS (13)/TiO2 shows a red shift in absorption with a band gap of 2.0 eV (curve h). The annealing process could reduce the concentration of defects and improve the electrical transport properties of both the CdS QDs and the photoanode.22 After annealing, an obvious enhancement in absorption was observed for CdS (13)/TiO2 and CdS–Mn (13)/TiO2, but the band gaps remained unchanged (curves g and i). Similarly, CdS (13)/TiO2–N also showed a red shift with a band gap of 1.73 eV after annealing (curve j). After modifying TiO2–N with CdS–Mn (13) and annealing, the onset of absorption further shifted to the red region with a band gap of 1.43 eV, in addition to the enhancement of absorption over the entire measurement region.30

It has been reported previously that a higher light harvesting capability results in a better photocurrent response.2,20 We used typical photoelectrodes to characterize the photocurrent response (Fig. 5C). The pristine TiO2 and TiO2–N photoelectrodes showed a relatively low photocurrent density of 0.33 and 0.68 mA cm−2, respectively. The concentration of N in the TiO2 photoelectrodes can be easily controlled by changing the reaction temperature and duration of doping.31 Fig. S6† shows the optimization of the concentration of N doping in the TiO2 photoelectrodes. The best performance of 0.68 mA cm−2 was achieved at 300 °C with 30 min of doping. Pristine TiO2 was expected to have a low photocurrent density due to the limited absorption of visible light. However, the TiO2–N sample showed a better photocurrent density than the pristine sample. This can be understood in terms of the N doping energy levels in TiO2. The observed absorption of visible light in TiO2–N is attributed to the excitation of electrons from No (substitutional N doping at the O sites) levels to oxygen vacancy (Vo) levels. As the Vo levels are located well below the hydrogen reduction potential (H2O/H2), they are unable to generate hydrogen and thus enhance the photocurrent density.23
Both the CdS and CdS–Mn sensitized TiO2 photoelectrodes showed a remarkable enhancement in photocurrent density to 4.7 and 5.6 mA cm−2, which is an order of magnitude greater than pristine TiO2 or TiO2–N. Fig. S7† shows the corresponding optimization of the concentration of Mn2+ doping in CdS. The optimum concentration of 0.05 M Mn2+ resulted in a better photocurrent response and this concentration was chosen for further investigation. However, at increased Mn2+ concentrations, Mn2+–Mn2+ exchange interactions also provided a mechanism for circumventing forbidden spins because the transition only needed to conserve the total spin of the cluster.32,33 Although these mechanisms are not usually very efficient and transitions between the 6A1 ground state and all ligand field excited states remain largely forbidden, the photocurrent densities showed an obvious decrease at Mn2+ concentrations >0.05 M. This enhancement was expected based on the strong visible light absorption of the CdS and CdS–Mn QDs. The CdS coating, which has a much lower oxidation potential, results in low photo-oxidative degradation and surface defects and therefore passivates the TiO2 surface, playing a dominant role in improving the performance because of the more efficient separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Doping of Mn creates electronic states in the mid-gap region of the CdS QDs, altering the charge separation and recombination dynamics, in addition to tuning the optical and electronic properties by the Mn d–d transition (4T1–6A1), which is both spin and orbitally forbidden and results in a very long lifetime of the order of several hundred microseconds.18 These as-created long-lived charge carriers improved the photoresponse of the CdS/TiO2 photoelectrode by about 19% to 5.6 mA cm−2.
The contribution of the CdS sensitizers to the photocurrent density in the TiO2–N/CdS (13) photoelectrode should be no more than the value of the TiO2/CdS photoelectrode (4.7 mA cm−2). This indicates that the contribution from N doping is at least 2.3 mA cm−2 (7.0 minus 4.7 mA cm2). The TiO2–N had a photocurrent density of 0.68 mA cm−2 and the novel heterojunction increased the photocurrent density value to 1.62 mA cm−2 (2.3 minus 0.68 mA cm−2). The extended absorption spectrum and the improved photoresponse should have contributed to the enhanced photocurrent density. However, these cannot account for all the enhancement as the increase in photon absorption is not as high as the increase in the photocurrent.
As N doping alone does not noticeably increase the photocurrent and because the photocurrent for CdS/TiO2–N is much higher than the simple sum of the photocurrents for CdS/TiO2 and TiO2–N, a synergistic effect between N doping and sensitization with the CdS QDs is clearly in operation and is responsible for the enhanced photocurrent in CdS/TiO2–N compared with CdS/TiO2. More importantly, if CdS was replaced by the CdS–Mn QDs, the synergistic effect was further magnified. The Mn doping strategy improved the photoresponse of the CdS/TiO2 photoelectrode by about 19% to 5.6 mA cm−2 (CdS–Mn/TiO2). However, in one experiment using TiO2–N as the basic photoelectrode, the CdS–Mn/TiO2–N photoelectrode showed a higher photocurrent density of 8.9 mA cm−2, an increase of 27% compared with CdS/TiO2–N. It is surprising that the same doping strategy and dopant (Mn) induced very different enhancement effects for different basic photoelectrodes of TiO2 and TiO2–N. It could be speculated that a double synergistic effect resulting from N doping in TiO2 and Mn doping in CdS played an important role in this remarkable photocurrent response.
To understand the physical processes underlying the broad light absorption and effective carrier extraction, a double synergistic effect (Scheme 1) is proposed for the charge transfer mechanism in the CdS–Mn/TiO2–N photoelectrode system based on our experimental results and previous reports.17,18,22
 Scheme 1  Schematic diagram illustrating the electron/transfer (ket/Kht) from doped CdS into TiO2. Kr, kr′, N0 and V0 represent electron recombination with holes, redox couple, substitutional N-doping at O and oxygen vacancies, respectively. 
After doping, TiO2–N has a higher density of oxygen vacancies (Vo). As a result of the appearance of both Vo and N impurities in TiO2, electron transfer from the occupied 3d states (Ti3+) to the lower energy empty 2p states (N impurities) is favorable because it simultaneously lowers the formation energy of Vo and stabilizes the N impurities.34 This electron transfer process also results in partially occupied Vo levels located at about 0.4 eV above the CdS valence band edge, which can facilitate hole transfer from CdS to TiO2 after photoexcitation of the CdS QDs.20 This interfacial hole transfer could improve the photocurrent response of the CdS/TiO2–N photoelectrode in two ways.20 First, electron–hole recombination in CdS QDs is restrained35,36 because the TiO2 crystal has a low recombination reactivity between electrons and holes. Therefore parts of the holes transferred into the TiO2 nanostructures are used for sulfide oxidation, which reduces recombination as the holes transfer from CdS to TiO2, mediated through oxygen vacancies created by N doping. Second, recombination between the holes transferred to the Vo levels and the electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 or CdS is not expected to be significant because the coupling between the localized Vo states and the delocalized conduction band should be weak. Although the typical hole diffusion length in n-TiO2 obtained from photoelectrochemical data is of the order of 10−6 cm,37 hole diffusion could be significant in these one-/two-dimensional TiO2 hybrids because they provide a short diffusion length for the minority carriers.
On excitation of the CdS QDs, the photogenerated electrons can easily transfer to the Mn 4T1 state.18,38 The mid-gap states created by Mn doping cause electrons to become trapped and screens them from charge recombination with holes and the oxidized polysulfide electrolyte. The electrons traveling along the TiO2 to the Ti substrate are then efficiently collected using an external circuit. This explanation is consistent with all the UV-visible spectrophotometry results. These results strongly suggest that the enhancement in photoresponse for the Mn–CdS QD-sensitized and N-doped TiO2 is due to the double synergistic effect of N doping TiO2 (TiO2–N), which facilitates hole transfer/transport from the sensitizer to the TiO2 via oxygen vacancy states mediated by N and Mn doping that creates electronic states in the CdS mid-gap region, thus altering the charge separation and recombination dynamics in addition to tuning the optical properties.
Photocatalytic performance assay
On irradiation, the photogenerated valence band holes of photocatalysts in aqueous solution typically interact with chemisorbed OH− (H2O) to form surface-bound hydroxyl radicals (OH·) and the conduction band electrons react with adsorbed O2 to form superoxide radicals (O2˙−).39 Wu et al.40 have previously reported the role of superoxide radicals in the efficiency of photocatalysts.
We used terephthalic acid as a fluorescence probe because it can react with OH· in basic solutions to generate 2-hydroxy terephthalic acid, which emits a unique fluorescence signal with a peak at 424 nm. The amount of photogenerated OH· radicals was determined by PL using different photoelectrodes, including TiO2–N (Fig. 6A), TiO2/CdS–Mn (Fig. 6B) and TiO2–N/CdS–Mn (Fig. 6C). The PL was recorded with different irradiation times based on the differences in the photocurrent density to illustrate the photocatalytic properties. The linear relationship between the fluorescence intensity and irradiation time (Fig. 6D) not only confirms the stability of the photoelectrodes, but also supports our proposed double synergistic effect, which results in the maximum photocatalytic performance for the TiO2–N/CdS–Mn photoelectrode.

Charge transport and recombination behavior
The recombination and transfer behaviors of the photoinduced electrons and holes in the photoelectrodes were verified by the PL emission spectra and supported the increase in photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic performance resulting from a double synergistic effect.41 Fig. 7 shows that the PL intensity of TiO2 decreased with the introduction of N. This quenching behavior confirmed that the transmission of charge carriers inside TiO2–N is adjusted by Vo and No. The PL intensity of TiO2 further decreased after the introduction of CdS, indicating that the loading process inhibited the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, which led to the decrease in PL intensity. TiO2/CdS–Mn exhibited a much weaker PL intensity than TiO2/CdS, indicating the superior electron transfer ability of the Mn 4T1 state. The drastic quenching of the PL signal after the introduction of TiO2–N indicates that the photogenerated electrons can be transferred more easily with the help of the double synergistic effect. The maximum quenching behavior occurred when Mn was introduced into CdS to sensitize the TiO2–N photoelectrode. The quenching abilities of different photoelectrodes match well with the photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic performance.

Conclusions
We synthesized novel TiO2 nanostructures and nanocomposite materials based on Mn–CdS QDs and N-doped TiO2 arrays with enhanced photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical activity in the visible region and demonstrated experimentally that a dual synergistic effect of sensitization and elemental doping significantly enhanced the photoelectrochemical activity of TiO2–N/CdS–Mn. Enhanced electron–hole separation and transfer through oxygen vacancy states, substitutional N doping at the O sites and electronic states in the mid-gap region of the CdS mediated by N and Mn doping is proposed to explain the observed experimental results.
