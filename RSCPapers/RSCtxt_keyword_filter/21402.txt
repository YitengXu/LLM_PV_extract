    , Accepted 5th August 2019First published on 6th August 2019AbstractSolar cells based on semiconductor materials with low diffusion lengths like organics and amorphous silicon exhibit short circuit currents and energy conversion efficiencies distinctly below the detailed balance limit (commonly called the Shockley Queisser limit). The short circuit current and energy conversion efficiency of such solar cells can be increased by employing a 3D device architecture. The 3D device architecture leads to a distinct gain in the optical thickness of such solar cells compared to a conventional planar solar cell, while the electrical thickness of the investigated 3D and planar solar cells is equal. Hence a short circuit current can be achieved close to the theoretical upper limit. In this study, a 3D organic solar cell is studied. The influence of the 3D architecture on the solar cell performance parameters of a small molecule organic solar cell was investigated. Finite-difference time-domain optical simulations are utilized to determine the quantum efficiency and short circuit current of the 3D solar cell structure. A guideline is provided on how to achieve a high energy conversion efficiency with a 3D solar cell. The proposed approach is not only applicable to organic solar cells. The approach is applicable to all solar energy materials with low diffusion length and/or low charge carrier mobility.
1. Introduction
Photovoltaics have gained substantial attention as an electrical energy source due to improved energy conversion efficiencies of solar cells and a distinct reduction of material and manufacturing costs. Amongst others, the energy conversion efficiency of solar cells is determined by the electrical and optical properties of the absorber material, which are represented by the diffusion length and the penetration or absorption depth. The diffusion length of electronic charges is given by (1)where tD is the diffusion length of the minority carriers, μn/p is the charge carrier mobility, and τn/p is the lifetime of the minority carriers. The diffusion length should be larger than the thickness of the solar cell. In other words, the solar cell should be electrically thin, so that photogenerated charges reach the contacts without being lost due to recombination. The penetration or absorption depth, tp, is given by (2)where α(λ) is the wavelength dependent absorption coefficient. The penetration depth is the distance over which the intensity of the incident light dropped to 1/e. Hence, the thickness of the solar cell should be equal or thicker than half of the penetration depth (round-trip of light in the solar cell). In other words, the solar cell should be optically thick, so that all incident photons are absorbed. Fig. 1 exhibits schematically the energy conversion efficiency of different solar energy materials as a function of the ratio of diffusion length to absorption depth (tD/tp). High energy conversion efficiencies can be reached if the tD/tp ratio of the absorber material is larger than one. Gallium arsenide (GaAs) and crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells exhibit tD/tp ratios distinctly larger than 1, which leads to energy conversion efficiencies close to the detailed balance limit commonly called Shockley–Queisser limit.1–5 The record energy conversion efficiency of GaAs single junction solar cells is approaching 30%. For material systems like copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), cadmium telluride (CdTe) and perovskites the tD/tp ratio is larger than one and energy conversion efficiencies exceeding 20% have been demonstrated.3,4,6,7 Material systems like amorphous silicon or organic semiconductors exhibit tD/tp ratio slightly or distinctly smaller than one.4,8 Hence the achieved energy conversion efficiencies are distinctly smaller than the detailed balance limit.8–13 However, thin film silicon materials and organic solar cells can be fabricated at low temperatures on large areas and/or flexible substrates allowing for low-cost manufacturing. The thickness of such solar cells is determined by the electronic properties of the used solar material.14,15 Hence, the thickness of the solar cells is smaller or even distinctly smaller than the penetration depth, so that the achieved short circuit current and energy conversion efficiency is significantly smaller than the theoretical limit of the energy conversion efficiency. Different photon management approaches have been studied to increase the short circuit current. In the case of silicon thin film solar cells light trapping concepts have been intensively studied.16–22 In most cases, the front and/or the back-contact interfaces are textured allowing for the refraction and/or diffraction of the incident light.23–25 Light trapping cannot be applied to very thin solar cells like organic solar cells with typical thickness of less than 100 nm. Organic solar cells are typically thinner than silicon thin film solar cells with typical thicknesses of several hundred nanometers, so that the number of modes that couple in the solar cell is limited. Hence, the concept of using textured front and/or back interfaces cannot be used to achieve significant gains in the short circuit current of organic solar cells. We have carried out optical simulations for organic solar cells with integrated light trapping structure, but the short circuit current density gain is very small.

In this study, the concept of a 3D solar cell is introduced and described. To distinguish textured solar cells from 3D solar cells we use the dimensions of the solar cell. A 3D solar cell is characterized by a texture, that is larger than the thickness of the solar cell. While in the case of a textured solar cell, the dimensions of the texture are typically smaller than the thickness of the solar cell. In this study, we apply the 3D solar cell concept to an organic material system, but the concept is not limited to organic materials. The concept can be applied to all solar energy materials with tD/tp ratio smaller than 1. The concept is getting more efficient with decreasing tD/tp ratio.
Different 3D solar cells have been proposed, experimentally realized and described in the literature.26–30 Like conventional solar cells, an optimal device design exists at which the energy conversion efficiency is maximized. With increasing roughness and surface area of the solar cell, the short circuit current usually increases, while the open circuit voltage drops. Hence, a point exists at which the relative gain of the short circuit current is smaller than the relative loss of the open circuit voltage. In this study, we propose a procedure that allows for designing a solar cell with dimensions close to the optimal dimensions. The proposed approach provides a simple procedure to realize such devices without using complex numerical simulations.
The device structure of the 3D solar cell is introduced in Section 2. The methods to study the optical light propagation in the 3D solar cell is described in Section 3, while the simulation results are presented in Section 4. Guidelines on how to design 3D solar cells with almost maximal energy conversion efficiency are provided in Section 5 followed by the summary in Section 6.
2. Device structure of 3D solar cell
The device geometry of the 3D solar cell is shown in Fig. 2(b), while a planar reference solar cell is shown in Fig. 2(a). In the following, the terms “optical thickness” and “electrical thickness” are used to describe the organic solar cells. The electrical thickness (telec) refers to the maximal distance over which separated electron/hole pairs must be transported before reaching the contacts. The optical thickness (topt) is the averaged thickness of a solar cell in the direction of the incident light. In the case of a planar reference solar cell, the electrical and optical thickness is equal to the nominal thickness. The situation is different for the 3D solar cell. The optical thickness is increased as indicated by the green arrow in Fig. 2(b). In the case of the 3D solar cell, the electrical thickness is equal to the nominal thickness and the nominal thickness of the planar and the 3D solar cell is equal. The optical thickness of the 3D solar cell is larger than the electrical thickness. In the case of the 3D solar cell, it is assumed that the solar cell layer-stack is grown conformally on an array of textured pyramids. It is assumed that the film grows in the direction of the local surface normal. With other words, the film exhibits perfect side-wall coverage. Such growth is typically observed for films prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD). Hence, the optical thickness of the film depends on the nominal thickness of the film and the dimensions of the surface texture. The interface morphology of the 3D solar cell was determined by using a morphology algorithm. The algorithm was developed to calculate the interface morphology of films deposited on textured or 3D surfaces. The model was intensively used to describe the deposition of inorganic films or inorganic solar cells on 3D surfaces.17,29,31–35 In previous publications, we provided a comparison of calculated interface morphologies of inorganic films on textured substrates with experimentally prepared films. A good agreement was observed, which reveals that the model allows for a realistic description of film growth on 3D surfaces.33–35
 Fig. 2  Schematic sketch of (a) a conventional planar solar cell and (b) a 3D solar cell. 
In this study, a small molecule based organic solar cell is investigated. Small molecule films can be prepared by vapor phase deposition allowing for a good edge coverage. The 3D and the planar solar cell are formed on an aluminum (Al) back contact/reflector. In the case of the planar solar cell, a TiO2 layer inserted between the Al back reflector and the organic diode is used as an optical spacer. The thickness of the spacer was varied until the short circuit current of the planar solar cell is maximized. The standing waves formed in front of the back reflector due to the constructive and destructive interference of the forward and backward propagating wave is matched with the position of the absorber layer of the planar solar cell layer stack. In this study, the TiO2 optical spacer has a thickness of 10 nm. In the case of a 3D solar cell, a TiO2 pyramid with a square-shaped base is used. The dimensions of the 3D solar cell are described by the period, p, the edge length of the pyramid base, bp, and the height h. The design of the 3D solar cells was selected in a way, that the electrical thickness of all 3D solar cell is always equal to the electrical thickness of the planar solar cell.
A 25 nm thick fullerene (C60) layer is formed as an electron transport and hole blocking layer (ETL) on the TiO2 pyramid. A small molecule organic blend of zinc-phthalocyanine (ZnPc) and fullerene (C60) (ZnPc/C60 ratio 1:1) is used as an absorber material with an absorber thickness of 70 nm in the design of the organic diode. The thickness of the organic photoactive layer is determined by the exciton diffusion length of the material. A 20 nm of N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)benzidine (MeO-TPD) is used as hole transport and electron blocking layer (HTL). An indium tin oxide (ITO) film with a thickness of 130 nm is used as a front contact of the solar cell. The organic diode design is in agreement with solar cells described in the literature.36–39
3. Optical simulation method
Three-dimensional (3D) finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations are used to study the optical wave propagation. The device geometry was determined by the morphology algorithm,32 while the optical constants of all organic materials are adapted from literature and provided in the ESI† (Fig. S2).36,40–42 Based on the numerically calculated electric field distribution the power density was determined by (3)where, c is the speed of light, ε0 is the dielectric permittivity in the free space, n is the real part of the complex refractive index, α (α = 4πκ/λ) is the absorption coefficient with λ and κ being the wavelength and the imaginary part of the complex refractive index, respectively, and E is the electric field distribution. Next, based on the power density the absorption (Am) for each layer of the solar cell was calculated by (4)where, Popt is the incident power of the wave, while Vm is the volume of the m-th layer of the solar cell. In this study, it is assumed that the collection efficiency (CE) of the absorber layer is 100%. This is a reasonable assumption because the thickness of the organic absorber is selected to be smaller than the diffusion length. Hence, the calculated quantum efficiency represents an upper limit of the quantum efficiency. QE(λ) = Aabs(λ) × CE(λ).(5)Generally, the quantum efficiency is defined as the ratio of photon absorbed by the organic absorber layer with respect to the total light incident on the unit cell of the device. Next, the short circuit current was calculated under AM 1.5 irradiance43 as given below (6)where, q is the elementary electron charge, h is the Planck's constant, and S(λ) is the spectral irradiance of the sun. Only photons were considered with photon energies larger than the bandgap of the organic absorber. Sub-bandgap absorption was not considered in the calculation of the short circuit current. Simulations were performed for wavelengths ranging from 300 nm to 900 nm. For the simulation, a circularly polarized electromagnetic field with an amplitude of 1 V m−1 is assumed as an input wave. Further details on the calculation of the quantum efficiency and short-circuit current density are given in literature.16,17,43
4. Optics of 3D solar cells
The investigated device structure and the corresponding power density is shown in Fig. 3(a, c) and (b, d) for a monochromatic wavelength of 640 nm. Most of the light is absorbed by the ZnPc:C60 organic absorber. The corresponding quantum efficiency is depicted in Fig. 4. The highest quantum efficiency is observed in the spectral range from 550 nm to 750 nm, with values approaching 0.9. The period of the surface texture was kept constant at 600 nm, while the height of the surface texture was increased from 0 nm (planar or flat solar cell) to 1500 nm. The period of the texture was selected to be small, so that a high optical thickness can be reached. Furthermore, the edge length of the pyramid must be smaller than the period, bp ≤ p − 2 × ts, where ts is the total thickness of the solar cell. The total thickness of the diode, ts, is equal to the absorber thickness, t0, plus the thickness of the hole and electron transporting layers. If bp > p − 2 × ts, the valley between the pyramids is filled by the organic solar cell and the electric thickness is increased in this region. Most of the incident light is absorbed by the first 400 nm of the ZnPc:C60 covered pyramid.
 Fig. 3  Cross sections (a and c) and power densities (b and d) of the planar and 3D organic solar cell with period and height of 600 nm and 1250 nm, respectively. The power density was calculated for an incident wavelength of 640 nm. 
 Fig. 4  Calculated quantum efficiencies of organic solar cells on pyramid surface texture using a period of 600 nm, while the height of the pyramid is varied. 
With increasing height of the pyramid, an increased quantum efficiency is observed in both the short and long wavelengths region. In these spectral regions, the extinction coefficient of the absorber is low. The short circuit current of the pyramid textured solar cell is compared to a short circuit current of a planar solar cell. The planar solar cell is optimized, and the short circuit current of the planar solar cell is maximized by controlling the TiO2 spacer layer. The absorber layer is placed in the maxima of the standing wave formed in front of the reflector. The enhancement of the short circuit current of the 3D solar cell is mainly caused by the increased optical thickness. For small pyramids heights the optical thickness is increased only by a small amount and the short circuit current of the 3D solar cell is comparable or potentially even smaller than the short circuit current of the flat solar cell. For large pyramid heights the optical thickness is distinctly increased, and the short circuit current of the 3D solar cell clearly exceeds the short circuit current of the planar solar cell. Furthermore, the pyramid texture allows for an efficient light coupling in the solar cell.
The planar solar cell with an optimized thickness of the TiO2 spacer layer represents a reference solar cell, which exhibits a short circuit current density of 13.8 mA cm−2. The short circuit current density of the 3D solar cell as a function of the pyramid height is shown in Fig. 5. A distinct gain of the short circuit current density is achieved due to the increased optical thickness of the solar cell, while the electrical thickness for both device structures is equal. The short circuit current increases by almost 25%.

5. Guideline for realizing 3D solar cells with high energy conversion efficiencies
The short circuit current and energy conversion efficiency of solar cells using materials with low tD/tp ratio can be increased by using a 3D solar cell architecture. The short circuit current is increased by increasing the optical thickness of the solar cell beyond the electrical or nominal thickness. This is possible if the period of the substrate texture is small compared to the incident wavelength or the h/bp ratio of the pyramid is large. Hence, the optics of the solar cell can be described by an effective medium approach. Furthermore, an excellent surface coverage of the solar cell stack on the textured substrate is required.
The thickness of solar cell based on low tD/tp ratio materials is determined by the electrical thickness of the solar cell. Hence the short circuit current of the solar cell is below its potential maximal value because the thickness is distinctly smaller than the penetration depth. To approach the maximal short circuit current, the thickness must be increased at least up to the penetration depth. Hence the tD/tp ratio can be seen as a gain ratio, where tD/tp = 1/gain. The electrical thickness of the solar cell must be multiplied by the gain to reach an optical thickness that allows for generating a high short circuit current that is approaching the potential maximal short circuit current.
The actual optical thickness of the absorber layer is calculated by the ratio of the ZnPc:C60 layer volume within a unit cell to the area of the unit cell. The optical thickness can be determined by: (7)where t0 is the nominal thickness. The height of 0 nm corresponds to the planar solar cell with an optical thickness equal to the nominal thickness of the ZnPc:C60 layer. To ensure that the electrical thickness of the solar cell is not getting larger than the nominal thickness of the film the following assumption has to be fulfilled, p − bp ≅ 2 × ts, where ts is the total thickness of the solar cell of 115 nm, p is the period of the unit cell and bp is the edge length of the pyramid (Fig. 2), and h is the height of the pyramid. The optical thickness as a function of the height of the pyramid is shown in Fig. 6. If p ≫ ts, it can be assumed that bp ≅ p and the optical thickness can be approximated by (8)Hence, the optical thickness of the 3D or folded solar cells using the proposed growth technique is increased by the multiplication factor  in comparison to the planar solar cells.
 Fig. 6  Optical thickness as a function of the pyramid height. 
A good agreement between eqn (7) and (8) is observed as it is shown in Fig. 6.
With increasing h/bp ratio the optical thickness and the short circuit current is increased.
Varying the period or height of the pyramid dimension, while keeping the h/bp ratio constant has only a small effect on the short circuit current density. The total short circuit current density is mainly determined by the optical thickness as long as the base period stays in the range from p − 2 × tITO − 2 × tS < bp < p − 2 × ts, where tITO and ts is the thickness of the ITO front contact and the total thickness of the organic diode. Variations within this range are presented in the ESI.† The optical simulations show for example, that the short circuit current density of a solar cell using a base period of 600 nm and a height of 1200 nm is equal to the short circuit current of a solar cell using a base period of 300 nm and a height of 600 nm, which confirms that an equal h/bp ratio leads to equal short circuit current densities. For bp larger than p − 2 × ts the electrical thickness of the solar cell exceeds the nominal thickness. We have not investigated such cases. For bp smaller than p − 2 × tITO − 2 × ts the short circuit current density is determined by the area weighted superposition of the short circuit current of regions covered with pyramids and planar regions. In a previous study we have shown that the superposition principle is applicable to textured silicon thin film solar cells.44
However, the geometry has also an influence on the open circuit voltage and fill factor. The open circuit voltage of a planar or flat solar cell is given by (9)where kT/q is the thermal voltage, n is the ideality factor, and Iph and IS are the photocurrent and dark saturation current of the planar solar cell, respectively. The saturation current is proportional to the junction area. For a planar diode the junction area is given by p2, while for a 3D solar cell the junction area is increased to p2 × topt/t0.
Hence the open circuit of the 3D solar cell can be expressed as (10)and approximated by (11)
By increasing the topt/t0 ratio the short circuit current is increased and the open circuit voltage is decreased. The overall energy conversion efficiency increases with increasing topt/t0 ratio until the short circuit current starts to saturate and the energy conversion efficiency reaches its maxima.
The influence of the 3D device design on the short circuit current, open circuit voltage and energy conversion efficiency of the solar cell is provided in Fig. 7. Fig. 7 summarizes the trends and provides a relationship between the normalized thickness of the 3D solar cell and the solar cell parameters. The aim is not to provide absolute numbers for the open circuit voltage and the energy conversion efficiency of the organic solar cell investigated in this study. To provide such numbers the electronic charge transport of the solar cell would have to be modeled. Fig. 7(a) exhibits the short circuit current as a function of the normalized optical thickness for different diffusion length to penetration depth ratios (tD/tp ratio). The normalized optical thickness is defined as the optical thickness divided by the nominal thickness of the solar cell. Hence a normalized optical thickness of 1 corresponds to a planar or flat solar cell. The tD/tp ratio was varied by varying the diffusion lengths, while the penetration depth was kept constant for all subplots in Fig. 7. With other words, the optical properties of the material were not changed. Furthermore, the thickness of the solar cell was set to the diffusion lengths. Hence an increased diffusion length leads to increased nominal thickness. For tD/tp ratios larger than 1 or distinctly larger than 1 the short circuit current reaches its maximal short circuit current of 21.5 mA cm−2. Increasing the normalized optical thickness will not affect the short circuit current. The marks in Fig. 7(a) represent the solar cell design investigated in the previous sections. The reduced diffusion length leads to a drop of the short circuit current of a planar solar cell. To increase the short circuit current the normalized optical thickness must be increased. The open circuit voltage for different tD/tp ratios is shown in Fig. 7(b). In this study, the open circuit voltage of the planar solar cell was assumed to be equal to 1/2 × Eg/q = 0.8 V, where Eg is the bandgap of the solar absorber material and q is the elementary charge. The ideality factor was set to 1.5. The normalized optical thickness has only a small effect on the fill factor. Hence the fill factor was assumed to be independent of the normalized optical thickness. The fill factor was assumed to be 75%. The energy conversion efficiency is shown in Fig. 7(c). The highest energy conversion efficiency can be achieved if the tD/tp ratios is larger than 1. Planar solar cell exhibits a distinct loss of the energy conversion efficiency for diffusion lengths distinctly smaller than the penetration depth. With decreasing diffusion length, the nominal thickness must be reduced, which causes a loss of the short circuit current. The energy conversion efficiency can be increased by increasing the optical thickness up to an optimal optical thickness at which the energy conversion efficiency is maximized. With decreasing diffusion length, the optical thickness must be increased to maximize the energy conversion efficiency. Furthermore, with decreasing diffusion length the maximal achievable energy conversion efficiency drops. However, with decreasing diffusion length the potential gain of the energy conversion efficiency increases due to the 3D solar cell architecture.
 Fig. 7  Influence of the normalized optical thickness on the (a) short circuit current, (b) open circuit voltage and (c) energy conversion efficiency. 
To approach the maximal energy conversion efficiency the device dimensions should be matched to the material properties. The device dimensions should balance the material properties. The following formula can be used to realize 3D solar cells with energy conversion efficiencies close to the maximal energy efficiency. (12)The left side of the equation relates the material properties to the gain, while the right side of the equation related the device dimensions to the gain. The equation allows for approximately reaching the maximal energy conversion efficiency without using complex optical simulations.
In a first step, the diffusion length and penetration depth of the absorber material must be determined. In the next step, the nominal thickness of the solar cell is set to be equal to the diffusion length. Hence the electrical thickness of the solar cell is equal to the nominal thickness. Next, the diffusion length and the penetration depth are used to calculate the gain. Eqn (12) is valid if p ≫ t0. It must be avoided that the gap between the pyramids is filled with the solar absorbing material. Furthermore, bp ≤ p − 2 × ts, to ensure that the electrical thickness is equal to the nominal thickness for all positions on the substrate. In the next step, the dimensions of the height and period must be selected to fulfill eqn (12). Consequently, the optical thickness is increased up to a point where most photons are absorbed, and the solar cell retains a high open circuit voltage. Eqn (12) should allow for approaching the maximal energy conversion efficiency.
The proposed device design of the 3D solar cell is not limited to organic solar materials. It can be applied to all materials with tD/tp ratios distinctly smaller than one. The material must be prepared on a 3D substrate or the film/solar cell must be folded to increase the optical thickness of the solar cell. The concept of a 3D solar cell is of interest to indirect bandgap materials and potentially even to 2D materials.
6. Summary
A 3D solar cell architecture has been proposed for enhancing the short circuit current and energy conversion efficiency of solar cells consisting of materials with low charge carrier mobility. The concept allows for increasing the energy conversion efficiency of solar cells using solar energy materials with diffusion length to penetration depth ratios smaller or significantly smaller than one. In this study, the concept was applied to a small molecule based organic solar cells. The energy conversion efficiency is increased by increasing the optical thickness of the 3D organic solar cell, which leads to an enhanced quantum efficiency and short circuit current. The electrical thickness of the solar cell is not increased. The gain factor is introduced, which provides a relationship between the electrical and optical material properties on one hand and the geometry of the solar cell on the other hand. Furthermore, the influence of the optical thickness on the solar cell parameters is discussed. The energy conversion of a 3D solar cell is maximized if the optical thickness is approximately equal to the diffusion lengths. Guidelines were provided on how to select the geometry of the solar cell, so that the optimal optical thickness and the maximal energy conversion efficiency is achieved.
