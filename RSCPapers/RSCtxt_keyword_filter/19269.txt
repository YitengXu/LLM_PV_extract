    , Accepted 5th June 2018First published on 6th June 2018AbstractA novel side-chain polymer was designed and synthesized by integrating a methoxytriphenylamine-conjugated-thiophene moiety as the hole transporting material (HTM) unit on a polystyrene side-chain (HTM–P1) by the radical polymerization of its relevant monomer (HTM–M1). These two materials and their similar model compound without the styrene moieties (HTM2) were used as the HTMs for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The results showed that with similar device preparation and measurement conditions, the hole mobility of polymer HTM–P1 was about 3 times and 2.5 times that of HTM2 and HTM–M1, respectively. PSCs based on HTM–P1 as the dopant-free HTM afford an impressive highest power conversion efficiency of 17.2%, which is much higher than those obtained from HTM2 (3.2% without the dopant and 14.7% with the dopant) and HTM–M1 (9.7%). Moreover, the devices based on the HTM–P1 presented significantly higher stability than the device based on its model compound of HTM2. Hence, this study demonstrates that the side-chain polymer strategy is an effective approach to achieve high efficiency and highly stable PSCs using dopant-free HTMs.
Introduction
In recent years, the efficiency of organic–inorganic metal halide perovskite-based solar cells (PSCs) was improved rapidly, which is already comparable with those of current commercial technologies.1,2 With the unique characteristics of PSCs, such as a high charge carrier mobility, large absorption coefficient, broad spectral absorption range, and long exciton diffusion length,3–6 the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs quickly increased to over 22%.7 In conventional PSCs, hole-transporting materials (HTMs) play key roles in promoting hole extraction and transportation as well as suppressing charge recombination at the interface between HTMs and perovskites, thus improving the device performance.8–10 To date, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N′-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) has been the most extensively studied and applied HTM for perovskite devices.11–14 Besides, a large number of small molecular and polymer HTMs, such as spirobifluorene derivatives,15–18 thiophene derivatives,19–21 triphenylamines,22,23 triazatruxenes24,25 or poly-triarylamines (PTAAs),7 have been synthesized to show their competitive advantages in PSCs compared with Spiro-OMeTAD. However, most of these reported organic HTMs including Spiro-OMeTAD suffer from low charge mobility, owing to their inherent nonplanar configurations that lead to large intermolecular distances and weak intermolecular interactions.26,27 In order to improve the charge mobility of these HTMs, several additives such as tert-butylpyridine (t-BP), lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI), and cobalt complexes were added to the HTM layer. However, these dopants not only complicate the device-fabrication process but also decrease the long-term stability of the devices, due to their hydrophilic properties.14,28,29 Therefore, dopant-free HTMs with high charge mobility are highly desirable for stable and efficient PSCs.
A well-known strategy to design dopant-free organic HTMs is to employ electron donor (D)–acceptor (A) scaffolds.30–34 One attractive advantage of this molecular design is that the resultant charge-transporting properties of the HTMs can be improved due to the enhanced intermolecular packing via strong dipole–dipole interactions. In this way several kinds of D–A conjugated small molecules31 or conjugated polymers34 have been designed and synthesized. These materials could act as dopant-free HTMs in PSC devices achieving comparable performance to that of Spiro-OMeTAD. Nevertheless, the long conjugations of the rigid D–A repeating units of the conjugation polymers as dopant-free HTMs make it difficult for them to form good thin films owing to their solubility problems.35 Additionally, the D–A structure results in a consecutive zwitterion-like interaction with high double bond character between the repeated units, which stabilizes the quinoid structure formed within the polymer backbone but reduces the bandgap,36 and thus most D–A conjugated HTMs have low bandgaps. This might weaken their electron blocking ability and increase the chance of charge recombination. On the other hand, compared with the traditional conjugated polymers, side chain polymers, such as polystyrene derivatives with flexible chains, exhibit excellent film-forming properties. The bandgap and energy levels were slightly affected by the polymer chain, mainly determined by the units on the chain. Generally, side chain polymers were used as moisture protection barriers on the top of the back contact of PSCs or mixed with carbon nanotubes to form hole collection layers.37,38 Until recently, only several poly(9-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) based side chain polymers were used as HTMs in PSCs.35,39 The polymers of PVK and PVK–OMeDAD were used in inverted and traditional structure PSCs, achieving similar moderate performance with PCEs of 15.76% and 16.09%, respectively. These efficiencies are still low compared with some highest efficiencies (19.8%) reported by using conjugated polymers.40
It is necessary to explore new strategies by designing dopant-free HTMs with high hole mobility, good solubility, broad bandgap and room temperature processing-ability for high performance PSCs and flexible PSC devices. Herein, we design a novel kind of side chain polymer (HTM–P1, Scheme 1) by connecting a small conjugate of bis(methoxytriphenylamine)-conjugated-thiophene moieties we reported before (HTM2, Scheme 1)41 onto the side-chains of polystyrene. By this way the conformational freedom of the HTM units is supposed to be restricted by the polymer chain. Thus the charge transfer can be very efficient when such units are held close to each other.35,42 Compared with the corresponding small molecular HTM2, HTM–P1 exhibits a deeper highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO, −5.18 eV) and higher Tg (132 °C), which could ensure a well matched energy level with perovskites and fully stabilized amorphous state of the HTM layer. And the hole mobility of HTM–P1 (1.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) could be three times as much as that of HTM2 (5.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). As a result the average efficiency is greatly increased from 2.4% for HTM2 (13.9% with Li-TFSI and t-BP) to 16.8% for HTM–P1. Moreover, the devices based on the HTM–P1 present improved stability compared with the device based on HTM2 under an ambient atmosphere with 30% relative humidity without encapsulation after 30 days in the dark. We think that this strategy can be applied to most small molecule-based HTMs possessing suitable active positions/groups for polymerization, also including donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated molecules.

Results and discussion
Materials syntheses
The hole transporting material of HTM–P1 was synthesized according to Scheme 1. The synthesis of the monomer (HTM–M1) involves bromination of thiophenemethanol with N-bromobutanimide (N-bromosuccinimide, NBS) for compound 1, followed by a palladium-catalyzed Suzuki cross-coupling reaction with 4-[di(p-methoxyphenyl)amino]benzene-1-boronic acid for compound 2 and a substitution reaction with 4-vinylbenzylchloride for the monomer HTM–M1. The polymer HTM–P1 was obtained by the free-radical polymerization of HTM–M1 with 2,2′-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as an initiator. The overall yields from the initial compound to the final product HTM–M1 and HTM–P1 were 58% and 50%, respectively. The chemical structures of all the intermediates were confirmed by using 1H and 13C NMR and MS spectra. The polymer structure was also confirmed by 1H NMR, where the representative chemical shifts of the double bonds of the vinyl group of styrene (∼5.8 and 5.2 ppm) disappeared, showing the formation of the polymer. This side-chain polymer HTM–P1 can be easily dissolved in common organic solvents, such as dichloromethane, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, chlorobenzene and toluene. On the other hand, because of the easy synthesis of this polymer, the synthesis cost of this polymer is very low as compared with the price of Spiro-OMeTAD. A detailed cost estimation for the synthesis of HTM–P1 is given in the electronic supplementary information (ESI) (Table S1†). It shows that the cost (including that of regents, solvents and other consumables) required for the synthesis of 1 g of HTM–P1 is 10.2 $, which is almost 1/10 that of Spiro-OMeTAD.41 The main reason lies in the low cost starting materials and the simple synthesis route. Hence there is great potential for HTM–P1 for commercialization if it has reasonable device performance.
Photo-physical properties
The UV-vis and fluorescence absorption spectra of the synthesized HTM–M1 and HTM–P1 are shown in Fig. 1a and the characteristic data are summarized in Table 1. For comparison, the absorption and fluorescence spectra of the reported small molecular HTM2 in THF solution are also shown in Fig. 1a. As can be seen from this figure, HTM–M1 and HTM–P1 exhibited the same absorption maxima at 384 nm, which are 16 nm blue-shifted compared to that of HTM2. This is caused by the lower electron density of the two materials when p-tolylmethoxyl was introduced. For the PL test, the emission maxima of HTM–M1 and HTM–P1 are 476 nm and 477 nm, respectively, which are slightly red-shifted compared to that of HTM2 (472 nm).

HOMO–LUMO levels and bandgaps
The optical bandgap energies were determined to be 2.83 eV for HTM–P1, 2.83 eV for HTM–M1, and 2.75 eV for HTM2 (Table 1) according to their absorption edges from the absorption spectra (438 nm for HTM–P1, 438 nm for HTM–M1, and 451 nm for HTM2).
The redox behaviors of HTM–M1 and HTM–P1 were studied by cyclic voltammetry. Fig. 1b depicts the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of the HTMs in dichloromethane solution (1.0 × 10−3 mol L−1) with tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) (0.1 mol L−1) at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. For comparison, the CV of HTM2 in dichloromethane is also shown in Fig. 1b. As can be seen from this figure, the first oxidation potential shift increased slightly from 0.03 V for HTM2, to 0.05 V for HTM–M1, and to 0.08 V for HTM–P1. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of these compounds was determined from the onset oxidation (Eonsetox), which is also listed in Table 1. As can be seen from Table 1, when the p-tolylmethoxyl unit was introduced into HTM2, there was an increase in their oxidation potential and the corresponding HOMO level. The polymer HTM–P1 exhibits the deepest HOMO level (−5.18 eV), which could benefit the higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the device. The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) spectra of the HTM films were also recorded. The onset (Ei) and cut-off (Ecut-off) energy regions in the UPS spectra are shown in Fig. 2b and c, respectively. HOMO levels were calculated using the equation Φ = hν − (Ecut-off − Ei). Although the results showed a little difference from that of CV, they had the same trend, with −4.92 eV for HTM2, −4.94 eV for HTM–M1, and −4.96 eV for HTM–P1. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of HTMs were calculated by referring to their optical bandgaps obtained from their UV-Vis spectra to be around −2.3 eV (Table 1), which could block the electron effectively. Compared with HTM2, HTM–P1 exhibited a larger bandgap and higher LUMO level, which could favor the electron blocking effect and thus largely reduce the recombination chance.

Thermal properties
The thermal properties of these HTMs were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements. The TGA and DSC curves are shown in the ESI (Fig. S1 and S2†). The decomposition temperature of HTM–P1 of 317 °C confirmed its outstanding thermal stability. Owing to its higher molecular weight, HTM–P1 exhibits a higher glass phase-transition temperature (Tg, 132 °C) than those of its corresponding monomer HTM–M1 (Tg, 46 °C before polymerization; Tg, 125 °C after crosslinking, Fig. S2†) and model compound HTM2 (76 °C), which could benefit the stable amorphous state of the HTM layer.
Charge mobility
To investigate the charge-carrier mobilities of HTM2, HTM–M1 and HTM–P1, hole-only devices were fabricated with the device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO) glasses/(poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate), PEDOT:PSS)/HTM2, HTM–M1 or HTM–P1/Au. The hole mobilities of HTM2, HTM–M1 and HTM–P1 were measured via space charge limitation of current (SCLC) under dark conditions, as shown in Fig. 2. As can be seen here, at low voltage ranges (0–0.3 V) the current scales approximately linear with the voltage with a slope value of 1.1. In this region, the current is limited by injection from the metal contacts and the ‘trap’ in the organic semiconductors. At higher voltages (>3.0 V) the slope of the double logarithmic J–V plot turns to be around 2.8. In such a voltage range, the current is space-charge limited and the hole mobility of HTM2, HTM–M1 and HTM–P1 was thus calculated to be 5.6 × 10−5, 6.1 × 10−5, and 1.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Interestingly, for HTM2 and HTM–M1, almost identical hole mobility was measured, whereas HTM–P1 has higher hole mobility, almost 3 fold those of HTM–M1 and HTM2. This result demonstrated that the hole mobility was just slightly influenced by the p-tolylmethoxyl unit, but highly affected by the linking of the HTM moieties to the polymer side chain. The increased hole mobility may be attributed to the close stacking interactions between the small molecular HTM monomers induced by the polymer backbone, which could be beneficial for promoting a high hole mobility without the need for p-type dopants.
Surface morphologies and charge transfer properties
Before the device fabrication, the surface topography of HTM–P1 and its model compound HTM2 was investigated by atomic-force microscopy (AFM). Fig. 3a and b show the very smooth surface of the HTM2 and HTM–P1 films with a roughness (Rq) of 0.68 nm and 0.60 nm, respectively. These smooth surfaces are expected to provide excellent HTM/perovskite contacts, thus facilitating the hole transfer from perovskites to HTMs and protecting the perovskite from moisture. The contact angle tests (see Fig. S3†) of the three HTM films exhibit similar contact angles of around 92°, indicating the hydrophobicity of the films.

To investigate the charge transfer at the interfaces between the perovskite (Cs0.05FA0.81MA0.14PbI2.55Br0.45) and the hole-transport materials, steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded and are shown in Fig. 4. The non-doped HTM–P1-based bi-layered film showed an enhanced PL quenching compared to that of the non-doped HTM2-based films, indicating the better hole-extraction capability of HTM–P1 relative to non-doped HTM2 at the perovskite/HTM interface. Time-resolved PL measurements were carried out with an excitation at 375 nm (Fig. 4b). The pristine perovskite exhibited a radiative lifetime of about 107.5 ns, whereas the lifetime is much shorter for perovskite/HTM samples. The decay time of perovskite/HTM2, perovskite/HTM–M1, and HTM–P1 was 24.1 ns, 19.1 ns, and 16.9 ns, respectively. This indicates that HTM–P1 has a much better hole extraction ability than those of its model compound HTM2 and monomer (HTM–M1).

Perovskite solar cells
The prepared polymer HTM–P1 was studied as a dopant-free HTM in PSC structures, using Cs0.05FA0.81MA0.14PbI2.55Br0.45 as the absorber material. An optimized device (as is shown in Fig. 5c) was composed of a thin compact TiO2 layer, a mesoporous TiO2 layer filled and capped with the Cs0.05FA0.81MA0.14PbI2.55Br0.45 perovskite, an HTM layer and finally a thermally evaporated Au layer. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of PSCs that employ HTM2, HTM–M1, and HTM–P1, respectively, as the HTMs are shown in Fig. 5a and summarized in Table 2. The device based on HTM2 displayed a poor performance, with an average short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 18.2 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.39 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 29.1%, mainly owing to its low hole mobility. As for HTM–M1, with its higher hole mobility, there is an apparent improvement in the device performance, with a Jsc of 20.5 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.84 V and a FF of 48.2%. However, the device with HTM–M1 is unstable at room temperature. Most likely this is because of the uncontrolled polymerization of the vinyl double bond of the styrene or its low Tg. Therefore, the device based on HTM–M1 shows inferior reproducibility and poor stability (Fig. 5a and d). The device based on HTM–P1 not only shows a higher performance, with an average Jsc of 24.3 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.07 V and a FF of 60.5%, achieving an average PCE of 16.8% and a best PCE of 17.2%, but also exhibits a longer lifetime (Fig. 5d). This higher Voc of HTM–P1-based devices may be attributed to the lower HOMO energy level of HTM–P1. There is an apparent increase in the Jsc of HTM–P1-based devices compared with that of HTM2-based devices. This is mainly caused by the higher hole mobility of HTM–P1, allowing much hole transport to the anode. In addition, the deeper HOMO level and more efficient hole extraction ability favor the charge separation at the surface between the perovskite and the HTM. The EQE spectra and the corresponding integrated Jsc of the devices using different HTMs are shown in Fig. 5b. As shown in Fig. 5b, the EQE throughout the wavelength from 300 nm to 800 nm in HTM–P1-based devices is higher than those with HTM2 and HTM–M1. The EQE values indicate that the photo-response is more efficient for the device using the HTM–P1 due to its higher hole mobility and more efficient hole extraction ability. A small hysteresis was observed in the J–V curves. A likely reason for the occurrence of hysteresis could be the charge carrier trapping at the interfaces with the electron and hole-selective contact materials.44 The hysteresis of the device based on HTM–P1 is less pronounced. We attribute this to the faster hole extraction by this polymeric material of HTM–P1 than those of HTM2 and HTM–M1. We compared the stability of the PSCs with the as-synthesized HTMs by exposing them to ambient air at 30% relative humidity without encapsulation (Fig. 5d). The operation stability was investigated in the following way: the J–V curves were measured after storage in an atmospheric environment per 24 hours. The PCE based on the HTM–P1 exhibits longer lifetime compared with HTM2, only decreasing <20% after 30 day storage in ambient air with a humidity of 30% without encapsulation. This is mainly attributed to their lack of doping additives. Fig. 6 showed the time course of steady-state photocurrent and efficiency at maximum power point under AM 1.5 G illumination. The corresponding stabilized PCE is measured by applying a constant bias voltage taken from the maximum power point, and steady-state efficiencies of 16.55%, 8.52% and 2.85% were obtained for the devices based on HTM–P1, HTM–M1 and HTM2, respectively. All devices exhibited highly stable steady-state photovoltaic performances and thus proved the reliability of the performance of the above devices.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we used a new design strategy to construct a new dopant-free polymeric hole-transporting material (HTM–P1) by attaching a di(methoxyphenylamine-conjugated-thiophene) HTM to a polystyrene chain. The hole mobility of the polymer of HTM–P1 was improved by the strong interactions between the HTM moieties in the side-chain, which is about three times as much as those of its monomer HTM–M1 and model compound of HTM2. The PSC based on dopant-free HTM–P1 as the HTM affords an impressive PCE of 17.2%, which is much higher than those obtained from small molecular compounds of HTM–M1 and HTM2. This is mainly due to the higher hole mobility of the HTM–P1, which benefits the charge transport to the anode. In addition, the deeper HOMO level of HTM–P1 promotes the charge transfer from the perovskite to the HTMs, and the higher LUMO level blocks the electron more effectively. The devices based on HTM–P1 also exhibited a higher stability than the devices based on HTM-M1 and HTM2 after 30 days at room temperature in ambient air with 30% relative humidity without encapsulation. These results clearly illustrate that it is an efficient approach to construct dopant-free HTMs by attaching proper HTM small molecules onto a polymer chain to achieve high efficiency and highly stable PSCs.

Measurements and characterization
Routine Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance III 400 MHz (400 and 100 MHz for 1H and 13C NMR, respectively). Chemical shifts were reported as δ values (ppm) with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard.

Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured under AM 1.5 G one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2) with a solar simulator (Enlitech SS-F7-3A) equipped with a 300 W xenon lamp and a Keithley 2400 source meter. The light intensity was adjusted by using an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell. The device active area was 0.08 cm−2. The J–V curves were recorded from −0.2 V to 1.2 V with 0.01 V steps, integrating the signal for 10 ms after a 10 ms delay. The average Voc, Jsc and FF were based on 10 devices.
Device fabrication
PSC devices having the structure of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/perovskite Cs0.05FA0.81MA0.14PbI2.55Br0.45/HTL/were fabricated, wherein the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) was the bottom layer. The process for fabricating the optoelectronic devices is summarized as follows. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glasses (Nippon Sheet Glass) were cleaned with detergent, deionized water, and acetone and sonicated in ethanol in an ultrasonic bath for 30 minutes. After that, FTO glasses were treated in a UV cleaner for 30 minutes. The cleaned FTO glasses were coated with 0.15 M titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) in 1-butanol solution by the spin-coating method at 2000 rpm for 60 s, followed by heating at 125 °C for 5 minutes. The films were cooled down to room temperature and a 0.15 M titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution in 1-butanol was spin coated again to prepare a pin hole free dense TiO2 film. And then the substrates were calcined in a box furnace at 450 °C for 30 minutes. A mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) layer was deposited on the dense TiO2 layer by spin-coating the TiO2 ethanol solution containing 14.3 wt% TiO2 paste at 4000 rpm for 20 seconds, which was then calcined at 500 °C for 0.5 hour. The precursor solution of the mixed perovskite consists of 172 mg FAI, 507 mg PbI2, 22.4 mg MABr and 73.4 mg PbBr2 dissolved in 1 mL mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO with a volume ratio of 9:1. Then CsI, predissolved as a 1.5 M stock solution in DMSO, was added to the mixed perovskite precursor to achieve the Cs0.05FA0.81MA0.14PbI2.55Br0.45 precursor solution. The perovskite films were deposited onto the TiO2 substrates with a two-step spin coating procedure. The first step was 1000 rpm for 10 s with an acceleration of 500 rpm s−1. The second step was 4000 rpm for 35 s with a ramp-up of 2000 rpm s−1. Chlorobenzene (∼100 μL) was quickly dropped on the spinning substrate during the second spin coating step at 15 s before the end of the procedure. Afterward, the as-prepared films were heated at 100 °C for around 2 h until the color changed to dark red. The hole-transporting layer (HTL) was prepared by spin-coating an HTM solution at 4000 rpm for 30 s, which was prepared by dispersing HTM–P1, HTM–M1, or HTM2 in chlorobenzene (10 mg mL−1). Finally, a 100 nm thick Au layer was thermally evaporated in a vacuum of 4 × 10−5 Torr, at a rate of ∼0.05 nm s−1, to finish the device fabrication.
Synthesis of 2,5-dibromo-3-thiophenemethanol (Compound 1)
2,5-Dibromo-3-thiophenemethanol (1) was synthesized according to the reported literature.45 3-Thiophenemethanol (5.0 g, 43.9 mmol) was dissolved in dry THF (40 mL) in a dried 250 mL round bottom flask under a N2 atmosphere; the solution was then cooled to 0 °C. Then, NBS (17.2 g, 96.5 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture and the reaction mixture was kept in the dark and stirred at room temperature overnight. The residual NBS was removed through a plug of Cealite. And the THF was removed by rotary evaporation. The product was extracted with diethyl ether, washed with 1 M sodium hydroxide solution and water. The organic layer was concentrated and the product was purified by column chromatography with petroleum ether:ethyl acetate 3:1 (v/v) to yield the desired product (86% yield) as a light yellow solid. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ = 7.01 (s, 2H), 4.56 (s, 2H), 1.66 (s, 1H).
