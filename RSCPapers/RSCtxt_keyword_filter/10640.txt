    , Accepted 14th March 2020First published on 16th March 2020AbstractThe spectral mismatch between the distribution of sunlight (AM1.5G) and crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells is one of the most important limiting factors of the conversion efficiency of photovoltaic (PV) devices. As an effective solution, the use of the luminescence down-shifting (LDS) technique is an important way to improve the short-wavelength response of a solar cell by shifting high-energy photons to the visible range. Herein, a large-area (17 × 17 cm2) luminescent thin film consisting of a ternary europium (Eu3+) complex and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was successfully constructed through a solution casting method and further developed as an effective LDS layer to improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency of c-Si solar cells with a large active area (235 cm2). The self-standing LDS layer is flexible, transparent and easily attachable to the surface of the solar cell module. Compared with the uncoated c-Si solar cell, the one coated with the LDS layer displayed an enhancement of ∼15% in external quantum efficiency (EQE) due to the high luminescence quantum yield of the Eu3+ complex doped inside the layer. These results demonstrate that use of a large area luminescent film embedding an Eu3+ complex is a versatile and effective strategy to improve the conversion efficiency of large size PV devices, giving rise to its great potential application as an LDS material.
Introduction
Due to the increasing global environmental change and energy crisis, renewable and non-polluting solar cells are intensively considered as ideal alternatives for the development of energy storage technologies, which can directly convert sunlight into electricity. As the most common and effective PV devices, c-Si solar cells have been the subject of great interest in recent years.1–4 Although they exhibit great advantages of durability, abundance and simple maintenance, applications of c-Si solar cells have been limited due to their poor solar light utilization efficiency, low photoelectric conversion efficiency and high cost. As far as we know, the spectral mismatch between c-Si solar cells and the distribution of solar light (AM1.5G) has a profound negative influence on their conversion efficiency.5–7 High energy ultraviolet (UV) photons cannot be fully utilized because of the losses associated with the excess energy of the absorbed above-band gap energy photons, high surface recombination losses and the absorption from front glass and encapsulation materials.8,9 One of the straightforward and technologically viable strategies to extend the short-wavelength limit of solar cells is the LDS technique, which can convert high energy UV-photons into lower energy ones at longer wavelengths, thus improving the spectral response of c-Si solar cells.10–13 This is usually done by applying an LDS layer with UV-absorbing photo-luminescent materials on top of PV devices.
Over the years, LDS materials based on organic fluorescent molecules such as quantum dots,14–17 organic dyes,18,19 and lanthanide (Ln3+ = Eu3+, Tb3+) complexes20–24 have been widely applied.25 Amongst them, Ln3+ complexes have attracted increasing attention due to the integrity of their unique optical properties such as large Stoke shifts, sharp emissions, and long excited state lifetimes.26–29 To retain their luminescent performance over a long period of time, however, Ln3+ complexes must be incorporated into encapsulating matrixes, such as ethylene vinyl acetate,20 polydimethylsiloxane,30 poly(methyl methacrylate),11 PVA22 and so on. The formed LDS layers coated on the top of c-Si PV modules allow the down-shifting of photons in the range of 200–400 nm and convert them efficiently into lower energy photons. In addition, factors that have an influence on the enhanced conversion capability of LDS layers are numerous, with the photo-luminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of Ln3+ complexes being an important one among them.31,32 Recently, coordinating precursor Ln3+ complexes with another ligand synergistically has been proved to be a feasible strategy by us and other groups for the formation of co-ligand systems with higher coordination numbers, thus improving the luminescence of the Ln3+ ions and further enhancing the spectral response of PV devices.31 Although a series of research works in this field have been made by many scholars, these works have been focused on the c-Si solar cells with very small sizes (<10 cm2),13,31,33,34 which seriously restricts the wide application of PV devices. Therefore, it would be highly desirable to be able to further improve the utilization rate of solar light and prepare large-sized LDS layers with high PLQYs to extend the large-scale application of PV devices.
Herein, we present a large-area (17 × 17 cm2) LDS layer consisting of a familiar polymer PVA embedding a newly synthesized photo-luminescent ternary Eu3+ complex and its application in c-Si solar cells with a large active area (235 cm2) (Scheme 1). Coordinating the precursor complex Eu(tta)3·2H2O (tta = 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetate) with oxazoline and pyridine moieties of pybox (2,6-bis[(4R)-4-phenyl-2-oxazolinyl]pyridine) leads to the formation of a stable ternary complex Eu(tta)3pybox with higher PLQY (69%), which can convert harmful UV photons into valuable visible light and lead to a significant improvement (∼15%) in the EQE of the c-Si solar cells. In addition, the obtained LDS layer exhibits excellent UV light-resistance stability because of the protection effect of PVA compared with pure complexes. The photoelectric conversion efficiency (η) of c-Si solar cells coated with the LDS layer increases from 15.2% to 15.3% under AM1.5G illumination.

Results and discussion
The LDS material Eu(tta)3pybox was synthesized straightforwardly by coordination of Eu(tta)3·2H2O with pybox in EtOH and its chemical structure is shown in Fig. 1. Eu(tta)3pybox was comprehensively characterized with regard to its structure and purity by FTIR spectroscopy (Fig. 2), UV-vis spectroscopy (Fig. S1, ESI†), 1H NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis (Experimental section). In Fig. 2a, the absorption bands at  = 1610 cm−1 and  = 1543 cm−1 of Eu(tta)3·2H2O were assigned to CO and CC stretching vibrations of tta, which were shifted to  = 1609 cm−1 and  = 1538 cm−1 in Eu(tta)3pybox.35,36

Meanwhile, the peak at  = 1140 cm−1 corresponding to the C–F bond stretching in tta shows no obvious shift. By comparing Fig. 2b with c, it can be observed that the bands assigned to the oxazoline ring and the pyridine ring of pybox experience an upshift from  = 1646 cm−1 and 1579 cm−1 to  = 1660 cm−1 and 1583 cm−1 upon the introduction of Eu(tta)3·2H2O, respectively.11 This implies the coordination of pybox to the Eu3+ ions in Eu(tta)3·2H2O, which was also confirmed by the UV-Vis absorption spectra of complexes in EtOH solution. The band at 224 nm in Fig. S1a† is assigned to the absorption of the oxazoline ring of pybox and the strong band at 340 nm in Fig. S1b† is assigned to the absorption of tta. In Fig. S1c,† the absorbance of 340 nm was decreased obviously with the appearance of a band at 224 nm. In the 1H NMR spectra (Fig. S2†), all of the protons in tta and pybox are shown in the complex system. These results directly support the formation of Eu(tta)3pybox based on the synergistic complexation between the precursor Eu(tta)3·2H2O and the pybox moiety, thus leading to a new ternary Eu3+ complex, which can be further confirmed by luminescence analysis later.
Thermal properties of Eu(tta)3pybox and Eu(tta)3·2H2O were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in Fig. 3. The TGA of Eu(tta)3pybox showed no significant change below a T of ∼300 °C, showing an obvious improvement of the thermal stability of Eu(tta)3pybox compared with the precursor Eu(tta)3·2H2O, induced by the progressive coordination of the Eu3+ complex with pybox. Four decomposition stages can be clearly observed in the TG curve of Eu(tta)3·2H2O shown in Fig. 3a. The first weight loss below 180 °C is attributed to the release of physically adsorbed water and residual solvents, which is determined to be ca. 10%. The weight loss, from 200 to 500 °C, is mostly attributed to the decomposition of Eu(tta)3·2H2O. The plateau above 800 °C corresponds to the formation of stable Eu2O3.37 The TGA curves of Eu(tta)3pybox (Fig. 3b) can be divided into two temperature domains: the first large weight loss (∼60%) from 300 to 400 °C is due to the combustion of organic components. The second weight loss in the temperature range of 400–1200 °C corresponds to the decomposition of the Eu3+ complex and the formation of stable Eu2O3 (∼29.1%). Therefore, the amount of Eu3+ in Eu(tta)3pybox is calculated to be 12.57%, which is in accordance with the theoretical value (12.80%), implying the purity of Eu(tta)3pybox.

Subsequently, we characterized the photo-luminescence properties of Eu(tta)3pybox and Eu(tta)3·2H2O in the solid state. In Fig. 1b, Eu(tta)3pybox shows a more intensive characteristic color and brightness than Eu(tta)3·2H2O under 365 nm UV illumination, as well-demonstrated by their excitation and emission spectra in Fig. 4. The excitation spectrum of Eu(tta)3·2H2O (Fig. 4a) obtained by monitoring the 5D0 → 7F2 transition showed a broad band ranging from 250 to 450 nm attributed to the absorption of the tta moiety, thus indicating the occurrence of tta-to-Eu3+ energy transfer.38 Coordinating Eu(tta)3·2H2O with pybox leads to an enhanced characteristic excitation for both tta and pybox, suggesting the synergistic chelating effect on the efficient excitation of the Eu3+ ions. Compared to the excitation spectra of Eu(tta)3·2H2O and Eu(tta)3pybox, excitation of Eu(tta)3pybox arises mainly from tta in this complex, indicating that the use of the tta antenna is beneficial for the targeted application as it primarily increases and shifts UV absorption to higher wavelengths. Both the emission spectra excited at 380 nm of Eu(tta)3·2H2O and Eu(tta)3pybox gave five sharp lines at 579, 590, 612, 652 and 701 nm, ascribed to the 5D0 → 7FJ (J = 0–4) transitions of Eu3+. Of these transitions, the 5D0 → 7F2 band at 612 nm dominates the emission spectra and is responsible for the red emission color shown in Fig. 1b.39 Compared to Eu(tta)3·2H2O, an intensive luminescence intensity for Eu(tta)3pybox was observed. The luminescence decay times of Eu(tta)3·2H2O and Eu(tta)3pybox were also calculated from the decay curves shown in Fig. S3† and determined to be 0.26 ms (Eu(tta)3·2H2O) and 0.70 ms (Eu(tta)3pybox), respectively (Table 1). This result demonstrates that the lifetime of Eu3+ is significantly prolonged after the cooperative chelation of tta and pybox. In addition, the value of PLQY determined from the integrating sphere of Eu(tta)3pybox is 0.69, a much larger value compared to that of Eu(tta)3·2H2O (0.43) wherein no pybox is present. The clear improvement in the luminescence performance of Eu(tta)3·2H2O might be ascribed to the displacement of water molecules from the first coordination sphere of Eu3+ by the coordination of Eu(tta)3·2H2O with the second co-ligand, and therefore the coordination number of Eu3+ ions is increased.40 To verify our hypothesis, we therefore estimated the number of water molecules (nw) in the coordination sphere of Eu3+ based on the emission spectra according to the method described elsewhere.41,42 Compared with Eu(tta)3·2H2O, a lower value of nw (3.03 for Eu(tta)3·2H2O and 0.27 for Eu(tta)3pybox) for Eu(tta)3pybox implies that almost 2.8 water molecules were expelled from the first coordination sphere of Eu3+ ions in Eu(tta)3·2H2O through the synergistic coordination with tta and pybox units, indicating the formation of a ternary Eu3+ complex with a higher coordination number. Moreover, our interpretation was further supported by the variation of the intensity ratio I(5D0 → 7F2)/I(5D0 → 7F1) of the composites, which can serve as a parameter to probe the asymmetry of Eu3+ and a good measure of the strength of the interactions between Eu3+ and the ligand.43 As shown in Table 1, the value found for Eu(tta)3pybox (15.09) is much higher than that of Eu(tta)3·2H2O (13.76), indicative of lower symmetry of the Eu3+ site, thus leading to the strong luminescence of Eu(tta)3pybox.

Benefitting from their advantages of excellent luminescence performance and foldability, luminescent thin films show potential application in flexible optoelectronic devices, solar cells and luminescent sensors.44–46 Owing to its excellent luminescence performance, Eu(tta)3pybox is a promising candidate for this purpose and it is combined with a water-soluble organic polymer PVA to prepare a highly luminescent thin film via a simple colloidal chemistry approach. The resulting thin film with a large-area (17 × 17 cm2) showed a bright red emission color under UV irradiation (365 nm) as can be seen in Fig. 5a. Very interestingly, a strong bright red color was also observed when the thin film was tiled on the c-Si solar cells (Fig. 5b), revealing its great potential application in PV devices. We initially characterized the transparency of the obtained film by UV-Vis spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. S4,† broad bands from 300 to 400 nm with a peak at 380 nm are attributed to the absorption of the organic ligands. Furthermore, the value of transmittance is more than 90% from 400 to 800 nm, indicating that the film is very transparent in the visible region, which is in good agreement with the photograph of the film under daylight in Fig. 5c. SEM images in Fig. S5† provide a reasonable explanation for the high transparency of the thin film. The surface of the film is quite smooth, implying that Eu(tta)3pybox is homogeneously dispersed in PVA. Moreover, the thickness of the thin film is approximately 30 μm.

Generally, the photo-stability of the film is an extremely important criterion in practical applications of optoelectronic devices.46,47 The luminescence emission intensities of Eu(tta)3pybox-coating film and Eu(tta)3pybox were recorded by 365 nm UV light illumination in a photo-stability study (Fig. 6). No obvious emission intensity loss can be observed for the thin film upon irradiation for 10 h, while 18.1% loss was found for Eu(tta)3pybox without PVA. The emission intensity of the thin film decreased by about 15% after 24 h irradiation and by about 40% after 56 h irradiation, whereas the emission intensity of Eu(tta)3pybox decreased to about 70% of its original value after 56 h UV irradiation. The results described above demonstrate that the thin film possesses a better UV-resistance stability than the pure complex, which is likely attributed to the protection effect of the polymer matrix on the Eu3+ complex.47 A micro-environment is offered by the polymer in which an ordered and uniform dispersion of the Eu3+ complex is achieved with the absence of chromophore migration/aggregation upon UV irradiation.

The excellent transparency, large area, flexibility and bright color under UV-light illumination of the obtained luminescent thin film encouraged us to further explore its potential application in improving the UV light-harvesting and conversion efficiency of PV devices. As the LDS layer, the large-area thin film can be easily attached on top of commercial c-Si solar cells (P type, active area: 235 cm2) without changing their fabrication process. The EQE curves of solar cells ranging from 300–1100 nm are shown in Fig. 7. Compared with bare c-Si solar cells, the EQE of the cell coated with the thin film was almost unaffected at λ > 400 nm, whereas the values in the UV region increased by about 15%. We are extremely surprised at the large increase in the value of EQE since the increase in EQE is a prerequisite for improving the conversion efficiency of solar cells,10,30 which is attributed to the efficient photo-conversion performance of the LDS layer. The high luminescence quantum yield of Eu(tta)3pybox ensures that most of the absorbed photons can be efficiently converted to lower energy photons, which then pass through the thin film directly and are utilized by the c-Si solar cells.

We subsequently investigated the photo-conversion performance of c-Si solar cells without and with LDS layer coating using photocurrent–voltage (I–V) curves (Fig. 8). After coating of the LDS layer, the PV performance of c-Si solar cells was higher than that of uncoated solar cells. The related PV parameters (short-circuit current density (Jsc), maximum output power (Pm) and η) under AM1.5G at 25 °C can be calculated using the following equations:11 (1) Pm = FFVocIsc = VmIm(2) (3)where Aa is the active area of Si-based solar cells, Isc is the short-circuit current, FF is the fill factor, Voc is the open-circuit voltage, Pin is the incident light power per unit area and its value is 100 mW cm−2, and Vm and Im are the optimal operating current and voltage, respectively. The corresponding values are listed in Table 2, which clearly indicate the improvement of the PV performance of solar cells after coating the luminescent film. Jsc increases from 35.8 to 36.1 mA cm−2, η increases from 15.2% to 15.3%, and thus the short circuit and conversion efficiency are increased by a relative 0.8% and 0.66% respectively after the addition of the LDS layer. Compared with the value of ΔJsc/Jsc for other non-optimized systems (0.3% in ref. 11, 1.8% in ref. 20, 0.97% in ref. 48), the relative gain of Jsc is similar to that of these previously reported complexes. In addition, the increment of η can be attributed to the findings that (i) the high luminescence quantum efficiency of Eu(tta)3pybox can reduce the optical losses in the optical conversion process10 and (ii) PVA has almost no absorption in the range of 300–2500 nm, which avoids energy loss when sunlight passes through the conversion layer.

Considering that a recent study has focused on improving the photoelectric conversion efficiency of solar cells of small size, our large-area (17 × 17 cm2) LDS layer provided the possibility for its application in large size solar cells (>280 cm2). In addition, the film can be directly used on top of solar cells rather than being encapsulated into the ethylene vinyl acetate matrix in solar cells.49 This simple and rapid method further promotes the practical application of this LDS layer in PV devices.
Experimental
Materials
All reagents were commercially available unless noted otherwise and used without further purification. Eu(tta)3·2H2O was synthesized and characterized according to the reported procedure.35
Preparation of Eu(tta)3pybox
Eu(tta)3·2H2O (0.85 g, 1 mmol) and pybox (0.37 g, 1 mmol) were dissolved in ethanol (10 mL), respectively. The mixture was refluxed at 60 °C for 5 h. After being cooled, the reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure and the precipitate was washed with ethyl acetate and water. The compound Eu(tta)3pybox was obtained as a faint yellow powder in 95% yield. Anal. calcd for C31H24EuF3O4N3S: C, 47.56; H, 3.07; N, 536; found: C, 47.94; H, 2.61; N, 4.55.
Preparation of the LDS layer
PVA (1.2 g) was dissolved in 30 mL of water, then DMF solution (40 mL) was added into it and stirred for 30 min at 80 °C. The DMF solution (2 mL) of Eu(tta)3pybox (30 mg) was then added and sonicated for 30 min. The LDS layer was formed by dropping the mixed solution on glass (17 × 17 cm2), followed by evaporation of water at 60 °C in air for 10 h.
Characterization
FT-IR spectra were recorded in the spectral range from 4000 to 400 cm−1 with a Bruker Vector 22 spectrophotometer by using pressed KBr pellets for Eu3+ complexes. A UV-visible Agilent Cary 100 spectrometer was used to determine the wavelengths of the maximum UV absorbance peaks of pybox and Eu3+ complexes. Elemental analysis was performed on an Elementary Vario EI system. TG studies were performed using an SDT-TGQ 600 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 using dry air as the purging gas. SEM images were obtained from an FE-SEM (Hitachi S-4300) at an acceleration voltage of 10 kV. EQEs were measured for c-Si solar cells (P-type) without and with LDS layer coating. I–V curves were characterized by using a solar simulator under AM1.5G conditions at room temperature. Steady-state luminescence and lifetime measurements were performed on an Edinburgh Instruments FS920P spectrometer, with a 450 W xenon lamp as the steady state excitation source, a double excitation monochromator (1800 lines per mm−1), an emission monochromator (600, 1800 lines per mm−1) and a semiconductor cooled Hamamatsu RMP928 photomultiplier tube. Absolute PLQY measurements were carried out on the aforementioned fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere and the reference sample is KBr. The PLQYs of the samples were obtained according to the manual provided by the company. All spectra were obtained at room temperature.
Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully constructed a large-area (17 × 17 cm2) thin LDS layer with excellent luminescent properties, UV-resistance stability, flexibility and transparency via a solution casting method. The LDS layer consists of a UV-absorbable luminescent thin film embedding a newly synthesized Eu3+ complex (Eu(tta)3pybox) that acts as a down-shifting material to convert UV photons into valuable visible light. The synergistic coordination of tta and pybox units leads to the formation of a ternary Eu3+ complex with a higher coordination number, thus yielding excellent luminescence performance. Benefitting from the high PLQY (0.69) of Eu(tta)3pybox, the c-Si solar cell coated with the LDS layer was found to show an ∼15% relative increase in EQE in the UV region. Moreover, the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the c-Si solar cell also increases from 15.2% to 15.3% under AM1.5G illumination upon coating with the obtained LDS layer. Our results represent a major step forward in the research on the improvement of the conversion efficiency of PV devices with a large active area and are also of great interest for applications in collapsible optoelectronic devices.
