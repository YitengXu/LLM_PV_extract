1. Introduction
1.1. Liquid-crystalline semiconductors
In order to fabricate organic electronic devices, homogeneous thin films must be produced by inexpensive processes. Therefore amorphous organic semiconductors including pendant polymers have been used for xerographic photoreceptors1a and electroluminescence devices1b for a long time.1 The carrier transport processes use charge carrier hopping in energetically disordered systems, described by a Gaussian disorder model2a,b or a small polaron theory.2c
Attempts based on the idea that the alignment of π-conjugated chromophores in liquid crystal phases decreases the energetic disorder and increases the effective transfer integral have been executed by a few Japanese researchers.3 However, the current resulting from electronic charge carriers was hidden in the ionic current caused by impurities.3a,b In liquid-crystalline (LC) polymers bearing π-conjugated pendant groups, effective electronic charge carrier transport was not observed because of an insufficient density of chromophores and contamination by impurities.3c,d
In the 1990s, studies of AC conductivity and time-of-flight (TOF) measurements of columnar phases of hexaalkyloxytriphenylene derivatives4 as well as microwave conductivity measurements of columnar phases of hexabenzocoronene,5a,b phthalocyanine,5c,d and perylene tetracarboxylic bisimide derivatives5e revealed efficient electronic charge carrier transport in the columnar phases. In the smectic phases, electronic charge carrier transport was confirmed for molecules having relatively small π-conjugated chromophores by the TOF technique.6 Until now, various liquid crystal molecules including π-conjugated systems associated with electronic charge carrier transport have been synthesized.7 These liquid crystals are called LC semiconductors.8 Typical LC semiconductors are shown in Fig. 1.

1.2. Applications of liquid-crystalline semiconductors
In this decade, applications of LC semiconductors to electronic devices have been studied. Electroluminescence (EL) devices emitting polarized light were produced using uniaxially aligned photopolymerizable nematic and smectic LC semiconductors.9 Field-effect transistors (FET) based on ordered columnar phases and ordered smectic phases were also studied.10 Extremely high performance was achieved in FETs using polycrystalline thin films of benzothienobenzothiophene derivatives which exhibit ordered smectic phases.10e–g Flexible FETs based on LC thin films on polymer substrates were produced by the spin-coating method.10d Solar cells using LC hexabenzocoronene and crystalline perylene tetracarboxylic bisimide (PTCBI) derivatives were produced.11a Due to segregation of a PTCBI derivative from a LC component, p–n junctions were spontaneously formed. Solar cells based on LC phthalocyanine derivatives,11b,c LC fluorine derivatives11d and LC diketopyrrolopyrole11e have also been reported.
2. Nanostructured LC electronic systems
Combinations of π-conjugated molecules and superstructures on nanometer scales can produce new electronic and photonic functions. For example, periodical structures on a scale of the wavelength of visible light can interfere with visible light to reflect or confine it and they are called photonic crystals.12a In organic thin film solar cells, the construction of well-defined p–n junctions on a scale of several nm effectively improved their performance.12b
For conventional inorganic semiconductors, micromanipulation is required to introduce periodical superstructures into electronic systems. However, it needs patterning processes that are difficult to apply to mechanically fragile organic systems.
In contrast, self-assemblies of functional molecules can produce periodical structures on various scales in soft matter such as polymers and liquid crystals. Superstructures can be constructed in LC systems by the introduction of chirality,13a photochemical grating,13b and hybridization with nanofibers.13c LC superstructures can also be constructed based on nanophase separation of LC molecules consisting of incompatible parts, as pointed out by Meijer,14a Tschierske,14b and Kato.14c
2.1. Construction of hybrid structures based on gel templates
Gelation of liquid crystals has been investigated by Kato and coworkers using molecules bearing hydrogen-bonding sites, which are derived from amino acids.14c The gelator molecules form nanofibrous aggregates through hydrogen bonding in liquid crystals.
Kato et al. studied the hybridization of LC semiconductors with hydrogen-bonding gelators. They mixed gelators derived from amino acids with hexaalkoxytriphenylene derivatives, which exhibit columnar phases. Surprisingly, they observed enhanced hole transport in the columnar phases. The hole mobility was increased by a factor of 27 in the case of hexaoctyloxytriphenylene 1 with a gelator 2 derived from L vaniline, as shown in Fig. 2.15a,b
 Fig. 2  Molecular structures of a hexaalkyloxytriphenylene derivative and a gelator derived from amino acids. 
Kato et al. also designed amide-based gelator molecules bearing π-conjugated moieties as shown in Fig. 3. The gelator 3 bearing tetrathiafulvalene moieties formed uniaxially aligned conductive nanofibrous aggregates in nematic liquid crystals.16a Xerogels consisting of these nanofibers exhibited high conductivity on the order of 10−5 S cm−1 when they were exposed to iodine vapor. A urea-based gelator 4 bearing phenylbithiophene parts formed uniaxially aligned photoconductive nanofibers under application of an AC electric field in dodecylbenzene.16b

For application to bulk heterojunction solar cells, well-defined nanosegregated structures consisting of p-type and n-type semiconductors should not only increase the efficiency of photocarrier generation but also enhance the carrier transport processes. O'Neill and Kelly constructed a gel network of a p-type LC fluorene derivative penetrated with an n-type PTCBI derivative, as shown in Fig. 4.17 They coated a mixture of photopolymerizable and non-polymerizable LC dithienylfluorene derivatives 5 and 6 onto a substrate and illuminated the film with UV light to obtain a LC gel thin film. After washing out the non-polymerized component, a layer of n-type PTCBI derivative 7 was deposited on the sponge-like LC film, which had a roughness of several nm. Solar cells were produced using this bilayer film and it exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 0.6%.

2.2. Construction of periodical structures in LC π-conjugated systems for photonic functions
Combination of electroluminescence devices with photonic structures can enhance light emission. Kitzerow et al. fabricated electroluminescence devices using the electron transporting LC perylene tetracarboxylate 8 and a hole transporting triphenylamine derivative 9 on microresonators with a multilayer structure of dielectrics (Fig. 5).18 Enhanced EL spectra with narrow widths were observed for the devices.
 Fig. 5  Molecular structures of the organic semiconductors used for the EL devices with microresonators. 
A cholesteric phase has a helical structure with a periodicity on the scale of the wavelength of visible light, and it reflects or confines the visible light. Records of images13a and laser emission19 in the cholesteric phases have been studied. Another characteristic of cholesteric LC is to transmit circularly polarized light with the same helicity as the cholesteric LC and to reflect light with a reversed sign. However, most cholesteric liquid crystals are electronically inactive.
Cholesteric liquid crystals bearing π-conjugated moieties have been reported (Fig. 6).20 O'Neill and Kelly reported that the cholesteric LC 10 based on bithienylfluorene bearing chiral alkyl chains emitted circularly polarized light by the excitation of UV light.20a The width of its reflection band reached 200 nm due to its large birefringence, and the dichroic ratio exceeded 10 within the reflection band. Funahashi and Tamaoki synthesized the cholesteric LCs11a,b bearing quaterthiophene moieties and a chiral binaphthyl part. These exhibited a cholesteric phase at room temperature and emitted circularly polarized fluorescence.20b

In contrast to the smectic and columnar phases in which efficient electronic carrier transport is possible due to large intermolecular π-orbital overlap, only ionic conduction had been observed for a long time. However, hole transport was recently confirmed in the nematic and cholesteric phases of liquid crystals bearing large π-conjugated cores.20c–e
Photochemical reactions can produce photonic structures with periodicities on the scale of the wavelength of visible light. O'Neill and Kelly constructed periodical structures in films of photopolymerizable LC semiconductor 12 using a surface relief grating method, as shown in Fig. 7. They observed an enhancement of the photovoltaic effect in bilayer solar cells comprised of a grating LC hole transport layer and an electron transport layer of compound 7.21

2.3. Construction of superstructures through nanosegregation
Amphiphilic molecules have a tendency to form supramolecular self-assemblies such as nanofibers, nanotubes, and nanocapsules. In particular, supramolecular self-assemblies consisting of amphiphilic π-conjugated molecules have been extensively studied by Würthner,22a–c Aida,22d,e Ajayaghosh,22f,g Meijer,22h Schenning,22i and Müllen.22j
For LC systems, the molecules consisting of π-conjugated parts and their incompatible moieties (Fig. 8) form nanosegregated LC phases. Meijer et al. synthesized sexithiophene derivatives 13–14 bearing oligoethylene oxide chains.23a These compounds exhibited smectic phases in which rod-like rigid π-conjugated parts and flexible oligoethylene oxide chains formed separately assembling coils. Tschierske et al. constructed honeycomb-like network structures of hexagonal and square cylinders using oligothiophene compounds 15–16 bearing hydrogen-bonding glycerol groups as well as hydrophobic lateral alkyl chains.23b,c
 Fig. 8  Oligothiophene derivatives exhibiting nanosegregated LC phases. 
Yasuda and Kato synthesized polycatenar LC molecules 17–18 consisting of four or six alkyl chains and an oligothiophene moiety.23d Because of the competition of π–π interactions between the π-conjugated cores with van der Waals interactions between alkyl chains, nanosegregated LC phases which had layered, columnar, and micellar cubic structures were formed. The hole mobility determined by the TOF method increased to the order of 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the columnar phases, while efficient hole transport was not observed in the micellar cubic phases.
Nanosegregated LC phases are also formed by molecules with π-conjugated and ionic moieties. These nanosegregated structures can be expected to be mixed conductors that can transport ions as well as electronic charge carriers. The combination of electronic functions with ionic transport can create new optoelectronic devices.24

Fig. 9 shows ionic π-conjugated LC molecules. Aida and Fukushima synthesized a hexaalkoxytriphenylene derivative 19 bearing imidazolium moieties at the ends of the alkyl chains.25a This compound exhibited a columnar phase and can be hybridized with ionic liquids25a as well as carbon nanotubes.25b Müllen et al. also reported that hexabenzocoronene derivative 20 bearing imidazolium moieties formed nanofibers in the solution state as well as columnar organization in its solid state. In the solid state, aromatic and ionic parts assembled separately.25c
 Fig. 9  Molecular structures of π-conjugated LC molecules bearing ionic moieties. 
Funahashi and Kato synthesized phenylterthiophene derivatives 21–23 bearing imidazolium groups which exhibited nanostructured smectic phases.26a,b The competition of strong electrostatic interaction between the ionic parts with the π–π interaction resulted in the formation of layer structures where sheets consisting of π-conjugated moieties were separated by a two-dimensional mantle formed by ionic parts. In the smectic phases of the compounds, electronic charge carriers are transported within the sheets made from π-conjugated cores and ions can move within the two-dimensional mantles. It should be noted that the liquid crystals exhibit electrochromism under the application of a DC bias without electrolyte solutions.
In 1986, the first redox-active LC viologen derivative was reported by Tabushi et al.27a Chang and Kitagawa have studied a redox-active LC bipyridine platinum complex 24 that exhibits a hexagonal columnar phase.27b Its spin-coated film exhibited reversible electrochromism in an electrolyte solution.
Modification of LC molecular aggregation by hydrogen bonding has been studied by Kato et al.14c Nanofibrous supramolecular aggregates bearing hydrogen bonding sites and π-conjugated moieties have also been studied.22g
Yagai et al. synthesized a PTCBI derivative 25 bearing a hydrogen-bonding cyanurate part as shown in Fig. 10.28 A mixture of this compound 25 and a melamine derivative 26 formed a thermoresponsive supramolecular aggregate. Above 150 °C, the mixture exhibited a hexagonal columnar phase while a lamellar organization was observed below 150 °C. Microwave absorption measurements revealed electron mobilities on the order of 10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the LC phases.

2.4. Nanosegregated LC p–n junctions
For improvement in the performance of bulk heterojunction organic solar cells, well-defined nanosegregated structures on a scale of several tens of nanometers are required because the scale is comparable to the diffusion length of excitons.12b Moreover, a closed molecular aggregation and small energetic disorder in the LC phases can also enhance carrier transport.
The incorporation of p-type and n-type segments in a single molecule should be effective in forming p–n junctions on a nanometer scale because of nanosegregation between the two segments. Fig. 11 shows LC molecules consisting of p-type and n-type moieties. Pisula and Müllen reported columnar LC 27 in which n-type PTCBI moieties are located radially around p-type hexabenzocoronene cores.29a The LCs form a core–shell structure in which an electron-donating one-dimensional core is surrounded by an electron-accepting shell mantle. Yasuda and Kato reported LC molecules 28 in which an electron-accepting core is surrounded by electron-donating moieties. Ambipolar charge carrier transport was observed in the columnar phase.29b Yasuda and Adachi also reported LC semiconductor 29 consisting of electron-donor and -acceptor parts and applied it to bulk heterojunction organic solar cells.29c

Fullerene derivatives are typical n-type semiconductors. Fig. 12(a) exhibits LC molecules consisting of a fullerene moiety and p-type π-conjugated parts. Deschenaux et al. synthesized LC fullerene derivative 30 bearing an electron-donating oligophenylene vinylene moiety. In the LC phases, bilayer structures were formed and the fullerene parts were segregated between the layers consisting of dendritic mesogenic moieties.30a Imahori et al. reported a LC dyad 31 consisting of fullerene and phthalocyanine parts. The dyads exhibited a columnar phase; phthalocyanine cores stack to form one-dimensional columnar aggregates, around which fullerene moieties coiled themselves, as shown in Fig. 12(b).30b TOF and microwave absorption measurements indicated efficient hole and electron transport in the columnar phases. Hole transport proceeds through the columnar aggregates of phthalocyanine cores while electron transfer occurs between the fullerene moieties. The same dyads were also reported by Ohta et al.30c

LC block copolymers consisting of p-type and n-type segments also exhibit a nanosegregated LC phase (Fig. 13). Thelakkat et al. synthesized LC block copolymer 32 consisting of a poly(3-alkylthiophene) block and a polyacrylate segment bearing PTCBI parts in the side chains.31a Geng et al. reported π-conjugated oligo(dithienofluorene) 33 bearing a PTCBI part and solar cells based on the π-conjugated oligomer, which exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 1.5%.31b

Bent-core liquid crystals exhibit ferroelectric LC phases and have been extensively studied.32a Recently Walba et al. have found helical nanofilament phases consisting of bent-core liquid crystal molecules (Fig. 14).32b They prepared composites consisting of compound 34 and fullerene derivatives and observed more enhanced photocarrier generation and transport in the helical nanofilament phase than in the lamellar LC phase.32c

2.5. Nanostructured LC phases by segregation of side chains
In general, liquid crystal molecules consist of aromatic cores and alkyl chains. In the classical description, LC phases appear as a result of strong interactions between the π-conjugated cores moderately weakened by thermal motion of the alkyl chains. Yoneya pointed out the significance of nanosegregation between the aromatic cores and alkyl chains in the formation of LC phases.33 Therefore, incompatible side chains with aromatic cores instead of alkyl chains can induce mesophases.
Perfluoroalkyl groups promote nanosegregation in LC systems because of strong interactions between them. Fig. 15 shows examples of π-conjugated LC molecules bearing perfluoroalkyl chains. Percec and coworkers prepared a columnar LC complex consisting of an electron-donating compound 35 bearing perfluoroalkyl chains and an electron-accepting pendant polymer 36.34a Shimizu et al. synthesized a LC triphenylene derivative 37 bearing perfluoroalkyl chains.34b The compound exhibited a nanosegregated columnar phase because of strong interactions between perfluoroalkyl chains. Aida and co-workers synthesized a fused metalloporphyrin dimer bearing 18 semifluoroalkyl groups and a dimer bearing 9 semifluoroalkyl chains as well as 9 alkyl moieties.34c In spite of having the same structure of its aromatic parts, compound 38 exhibited a rectangular columnar phase in contrast to the orthorhombic columnar phase of compound 39. Surprisingly, electron transport was observed in the rectangular columnar phase of compound 38, while hole transport was dominant in the orthorhombic columnar phase of compound 39.

In electronic device applications, extended π-conjugated systems are indispensable for the enhancement of carrier transport and visible light absorption. However, the extension of π-conjugated systems lowers the solubility of the materials and promotes their crystallization. Branched alkyl chains are effective in inhibiting the aggregation of the extended aromatic moieties, although carrier transport is also degraded by the decrease of intermolecular orbital overlaps and the increase of structural disorder.35
Gregg et al. synthesized LC PTCBI derivatives 40–42 bearing hydrophilic oligoethylene oxide chains, as shown in Fig. 16.36a,b They exhibited LC phases having lamellar structures over wider temperature ranges while hexa- or tetra-alkylated PTCBI derivatives exhibited columnar phases in the high temperature region, as reported by Würthner et al.7a,b Moreover, they synthesized LC PTCBI derivative 42 bearing an ammonium group at the terminal of the side chain.36c,d The compound can be doped with metallic Na in a THF solution; the perylene core is reduced by Na, producing an anion radical species, which is stabilized by the ammonium cation on the side chain. Increasing the dopant concentration by over two orders enhanced the conductivity of the doped thin film of the compound by over four orders of magnitude.

LC oligomers based on silsesquioxane cores appended to mesogenic units were first reported by Mehl and Goodby.37a Liquid crystals bearing disiloxane and trisiloxane chains have been studied, and the stabilization of the smectic layer structures due to nanosegregation between the flexible oligosiloxane units and aromatic cores has been reported.37b–e
Guillon et al. synthesized LC triphenylene derivatives bearing oligosiloxane chains.37f They exhibited columnar phases, but electronic properties were not reported. Funahashi et al. synthesized PTCBI derivatives bearing oligosiloxane chains, as shown in Fig. 17.38a,b Compound 43 exhibited columnar phases at room temperature and it did not crystallize even when it was cooled to −100 °C. Moreover, they are soluble in various organic solvents and their thin films can be produced by a spin-coating method. The electron mobilities of the LC PTCBI derivatives were determined by a time-of-flight technique. In the ordered columnar phase of compound 43, the electron mobility exceeded 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature.38b The electron transport mechanism in the columnar phases is described by a Gaussian disorder model.38c
 Fig. 17  Molecular structures of LC PTCBI derivatives bearing oligosiloxane moieties. 
Funahashi and co-workers synthesized LC PTCBI derivative 44 bearing cyclotetrasiloxane rings.38d This LC compound also exhibited a columnar phase at room temperature and it did not crystallize on cooling to −100 °C. Nanosegregation between the aromatic cores and cyclotetrasiloxane rings was significant in the formation of the columnar phase. In the columnar phases of the PTCBI derivatives bearing oligosiloxane moieties, a kind of core–shell structure in which crystal-like one-dimensional aggregates of π-conjugated cores were surrounded by flexible shells consisting of oligosiloxane moieties were formed by the nanosegregation. Asymmetric PTCBI derivative 45, bearing triethylene oxide chains, exhibited a lamellar organization instead of a columnar structure.38e
3. Conclusions
The formation of dynamic and flexible nanostructures that enhance photonic and electronic properties is one of the characteristic features of LC systems. Through their nanostructures, various physical and chemical properties can be coupled to produce new functions in LC systems, unlike conventional crystalline and amorphous semiconductors. Combinations of electro-active π-conjugated systems and periodical structures based on chirality can create photonic semiconductors. Hybridization of gel networks and LC systems or nanosegregation between p-type and n-type segments in LC molecules should produce efficient p–n junctions at high densities. Competition between ionic and π–π interactions forms nanostructured soft systems with electronic functions. Side chains other than alkyl groups promote nanosegregation and realize new LC electronic materials.
