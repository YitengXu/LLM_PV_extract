    , Accepted 4th January 2018First published on 4th January 2018AbstractAgBiS2 nanocrystals are good candidates in optoelectronic applications due to their solution-processability, earth abundance and non-toxic properties. AgBiS2 thin film solar cells have demonstrated promising performance due to their high absorption coefficients and suitable bandgaps for light harvesting. However, their physical properties such as mobility, carrier concentration and photosensitivity, which are very important for photovoltaics, remain unreported. Herein, we develop an improved amine-based synthesis route and systematically investigate these properties by characterizing field effect transistors and photodetectors fabricated from AgBiS2 nanocrystals. We found that the amine-based synthesis improved their measurable semiconducting properties and their solar cell performance. The optimal thickness of a champion solar cell was found to increase to 65 nm, which achieved a power conversion efficiency of 4.3% based on a ZnO/AgBiS2/P3HT/Au device structure, compared with 35 nm of a champion solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of 3.9% reported previously. This modified approach could be applied in the preparation of other high quality nanocrystals that uses silver, where single valence Ag cations are of increasing importance in stable solution processed nanomaterials.
Introduction
Solution-processed nanocrystals offer a platform to fabricate high performance and low-cost devices such as gas sensors,1,2 solar cells,3,4 thin film field effect transistors5,6 and photodetectors.7,8 The physical properties of nanocrystals can be simply tailored by size,9 capping ligands6,10 and impurity doping,11 which could lead to the fabrication of high performance devices. In addition, nanocrystals can be deposited on substrates by simple spin-coating,4,12,13 dip-coating14 and spray-coating15 methods, which can significantly reduce manufacturing costs. In the past decade, nanocrystal solar cells have shown great progress due to significant improvements in surface passivation strategies and device structure evolution from Schottky junction,16 n–p junction17 to n–i–p junction12 cells. Among them, PbS and PbSe quantum dot solar cells stand out due to their suitable quantum confined bandgaps for light harvesting and favourable charge transport resulting from large exciton Bohr radii. The materials also show interesting next-generation effects such as efficient multiple exciton generation.18 PbS and PbSe nanocrystal solar cells have achieved certified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 11.23%19 and 8.2%,14 respectively. However, the toxicity of lead still remains a concern. The urgent need for non-toxic, earth-abundant, low-cost and high-efficiency solar cells drives research on new absorber materials for photovoltaics.
Very recently, AgBiS2 nanocrystals have attracted increasing attention because these nanocrystals consist of non-toxic, earth-abundant elements. Furthermore, AgBiS2 nanocrystals have demonstrated promising device performance due to their high absorption coefficient and favourable bandgap.20 Qian et al. synthesized AgBiS2 nanocrystals and achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.09% for an AgBiS2 sensitized solar cell.21 In 2016, Konstantatos et al. achieved a very promising certified PCE of 6.3% for an ultra-thin AgBiS2 nanocrystal solar cell, which opened up a new avenue for next generation solar cells in this material system.22 These examples demonstrated that AgBiS2 nanocrystals are of increasing interest as light harvesting compounds for advanced photovoltaic cells.
PbS quantum dots have been extensively applied in photovoltaic cells,4,8,13,19 light emitting diodes23,24 and thin film field effect transistors.6,25 Their performance has been improving remarkably and their physical parameters including mobility, photosensitivity and carrier lifetime continue to be optimized by many groups.3 The carrier lifetime has been prolonged due to better surface passivation,26 and the mobility of PbS quantum dot films has been increased due to optimized ligand selection.27 Similarly, to improve the device performance of AgBiS2 nanocrystals in photovoltaic devices, their physical properties need to be further investigated and optimised. Illas et al. performed simulations on the optical parameters of AgBiS2 to predict the bandgap and absorption co-efficient. However, there have been relatively few studies on the carrier mobility, carrier concentration and photo-response of thin films of the material. These parameters are very important for high performance optoelectronic devices, including solar cells, and remain unreported.
Herein, we synthesized two batches of AgBiS2 nanocrystals following both Konstantatos’ recipe and a modified route. For the modified synthesis route, the Ag and Bi precursors were dissolved separately in oleylamine (OLA) and oleic acid (OA), respectively. This modification was made since the Ag precursor dissolves more easily in OLA than oleic acid because of the amine's complexation with Ag cations.29,30 While OLA assists Ag cations to completely dissolve in the precursor solution and due to OA/OLA being present as mixed capping ligands, overall this is beneficial for nanocrystal quality such as morphology control, stoichiometry and prevention of nanocrystal aggregation, oxidation and degradation through increased surface coverage.31 To perform physical characterization of the AgBiS2 nanomaterial, we fabricated thin film field effect transistors to determine carrier mobility and carrier concentration and a photodetector to calculate the light sensitivity. Solar cells were fabricated to compare the device performances between the previous nanocrystal synthesis recipe and the modified one presented here. We achieved a 4.3% PCE solar cell of AgBiS2 nanocrystals that were synthesized using the modified route, which is a 30% improvement compared with a 3.4% PCE solar cell of AgBiS2 nanocrystals that were synthesized using the conventional recipe.

Materials
All materials were used as purchased without further purification.
AgBiS2 nanocrystal synthesis
For control AgBiS2 nanocrystal synthesis, the recipe was identical with that reported by Kontanstatos.22 Briefly, 0.386 g of bismuth acetate (Alfa) and 0.135 g of silver acetate (Alfa) were dissolved in 10 ml of oleic acid (OA, Sigma) under vacuum, heating and stirring at 100 °C. Next, 180 μl of trimethylsilylsufide (TMS, Sigma) in 5 ml of degassed octadecene (ODE, Sigma) was quickly injected into a mixed Bi and Ag solution at 100 °C and cooled to room temperature slowly. For the modified AgBiS2 nanocrystal synthesis, 0.135 g of Ag acetate was dissolved in 5 ml of OLA under vacuum, stirring and heating for 3 hours to obtain a uniform pink purple Ag precursor solution, and 0.386 g of bismuth acetate was dissolved in 5 ml of OA for 3 hours to form a transparent and colourless Bi precursor solution. Then the Ag precursor solution was transferred into the Bi precursor solution using a syringe to form a uniform mixed solution under stirring. 180 μl of TMS in 5 ml of degassed ODE was quickly injected into the mixed solution at 100 °C (without removing the heating mantel) and cooled to room temperature slowly. Both kinds of nanocrystals were purified by precipitation/dissolution with acetone and hexane12 two times in the same manner as for purification of PbS quantum dots,12 and then were dissolved in hexane at a concentration of 10 mg ml−1 for use.
Device fabrication
First 1 g of zinc acetate (Sigma), 280 μl of monoethanolamine and 10 ml of 2-methyoxyl-ethanol (Sigma) were added into a 20 ml vial under stirring and heating to 70 °C for 24 hours to form a ZnO precursor solution. The ZnO precursor was spin-coated onto a clean ITO glass substrate and annealed at 300 °C for 20 min to obtain ZnO films. The modified and conventional AgBiS2 nanocrystals were deposited onto the ZnO films by spin-coating in a layer by layer approach and then treated with 1 mg ml−1 tetrabutylamine (TMAI, Alfa) methanol solution for 20 s to replace insulating OA ligands with the atomic iodide ion, and then rinsed with pure methanol two times. The desired number of layers was deposited, from 3 to 6 layers, at a 1 layer interval. 5 mg ml−1 poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT, Merck) in chlorobenzene was spin-coated on an AgBiS2 film at 2000 rpm for 30 s. Then 100 nm gold electrodes were evaporated onto the device with an active area of 0.07 cm2. Both kinds of AgBiS2 nanocrystals were spin-coated on glasses. Then MoO3 and gold electrodes were thermally evaporated on these films to fabricate photodetectors. Field effect transistors were fabricated by spin-coating AgBiS2 nanocrystals on SiO2/Si substrates with pre-patterned interdigitated gold electrodes.
Measurement and characterization
The current density–voltage characteristics of devices were measured using a Keithley 2400 (I–V) digital source meter under simulated AM 1.5G solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 (Newport, AAA solar simulator, 94023A-U). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using an FEI Nova NanoSEM 450. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results were acquired using a Philips X'Pert PRO. FET measurements were performed using an Agilent B1500A semiconductor characterization system. The Hall effect was measured using an Ecopia HMS-5500. TEM measurements were carried out using a Tecnai G2 20U-TWIN. Photodetector performances were measured using a probe station connected to an Agilent B1500A semiconductor characterization system. The device was further covered with an aluminum cap to provide optical and electromagnetic shielding during the photodetector measurements. Illumination was generated from 760 nm light-emitting diodes controlled by a functional generator (Agilent 33210A). Light intensity was calibrated using a silicon photodetector (Newport 818-UV).
Results and discussion
The morphology of the AgBiS2 nanocrystals is important for device performance and can be controlled to some extent during the synthesis. For our modified synthesis route, Ag acetate was completely dissolved in oleylamine (OLA) instead of oleic acid (OA) under vacuum and heating to obtain a uniform and pink-purple Ag precursor solution, since OLA can complex with Ag cations. Nanocrystals produced by this method were denoted as modified AgBiS2 nanocrystals (M-AgBiS2). For the control samples, denoted C-AgBiS2, the recipe used was identical with that of Kontanstatos’ work, where OA was used to dissolve Ag acetate. Detailed synthesis methods are presented in the Methods section. Both kinds of nanocrystals were purified by precipitation with acetone two times, and then were dissolved in hexane at a concentration of 10 mg ml−1 for use. X-ray diffraction measurements were first performed to characterize the crystalline structure of AgBiS2 nanocrystals, as shown in Fig. 1a. The results show that the AgBiS2 nanocrystals have a cubic rock salt structure, which is in accordance with Konstantatos’ result.28 X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) measurements were carried out to analyse the element stoichiometry of AgBiS2 films treated with TMAI (see Fig. S1, ESI†), whose results are in agreement with those that others have reported.21Fig. 1b shows XPS core-level spectra of the Ag 3d peak, which suggests that the Ag content in the M-AgBiS2 film is more than that in the C-AgBiS2 film. This leads to better stoichiometry of nanocrystals as shown in Table S1 (ESI†), which could reduce nanocrystal defects. Then, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out to characterize the morphology and size distribution of the AgBiS2 nanocrystals. The modified AgBiS2 nanocrystals have smaller size distribution with 2.8 ± 0.2 nm diameter compared to 2.9 ± 0.6 nm diameter of the control AgBiS2 nanocrystals as shown in Fig. 1b and c, respectively. An improved size distribution can be expected from a synthesis in which the precursors are dissolved more completely owing to the coordination of N atoms in amine groups with Ag atoms. Small atomic clusters of the Ag precursor, for example, are likely to make nucleation seeds for nanocrystal growth and deliver different total Ag contents to the resulting particles, hence determining the size and shape of the final products.32,33 The above results show that the modified synthesis route narrows the size distribution, which could improve the solar cell performance.

The properties of nanocrystals generally depend on their morphology, so monodispersity of the nanocrystals is required for optoelectronic applications due to their lower band tail state density. In addition, thin films deposited from monodispersed nanocrystals are more uniform and smooth at the nanometer scale, which results from close packing of the nanocrystals. This close packing reduces the distance between nanocrystals, which is beneficial for charge transport and reduces leakage current.34,35 For solar cells, high carrier mobilities are crucial for a photovoltaic absorber layer because they strongly correlate with carrier diffusion length (L = (kTμτ/q)0.5, where μ is mobility, τ is the minority carrier lifetime, T is temperature and q is elemental charge). Therefore, carrier mobility has a strong effect on the collection efficiency of photogenerated carriers. Konstantatos reported that the charge transport of AgBiS2 films treated with TMAI was very poor, so the device performance deteriorated when the AgBiS2 film thickness increases even slightly in their solar cells. However, with the charge mobility in their films still unknown, it was difficult to attribute the lack in carrier collection exclusively to charge transport issues instead of the presence of significant numbers of defects limiting charge carrier lifetimes. To determine the mobility in AgBiS2 nanocrystal thin films, we fabricated thin film field effect transistors (FETs) with their performances shown in Fig. 2a. The AgBiS2 nanocrystals were deposited on SiO2/Si substrates by spin-coating and treated with TMAI, with an identical procedure to that used for solar cell fabrication. For the FETs, 5 nm molybdenum oxide and 100 nm gold were thermally evaporated as drain and source electrodes. The molybdenum oxide is used to modify the interface between the AgBiS2 film and Au. Both the modified and control AgBiS2 nanocrystal films show a weak p-type character, determined from the transfer curves, and a MoO3/Au contact improves hole extraction. Hole mobility (μ) was calculated from the linear regime of the transfer characteristics using eqn (1), and conductivity (σ) was calculated from the linear regime of the output characteristics using eqn (2), and the carrier concentration (ρ) was calculated using eqn (3): μ = L/(WVdsε0εr/d)dIds/dVg(1) σ = L/(RWD)(2) ρ = σ/(eμ)(3)where the channel length (L) is 150 μm, the channel width (W) is 100 μm, D is the thickness of a thin film of AgBiS2 nanocrystals, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity of 8.854 × 10−12 Fm−1, εr is the dielectric constant (3.9 for SiO2), and d is the thickness of SiO2 (300 nm). The slope of the transfer curve, dIds/dVg, is found from Fig. 2a. The calculated mobility is 4.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the modified AgBiS2 film, a two-fold improvement compared to the mobility of 1.8 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the control AgBiS2 film. The conductivity values are calculated using the slopes of the output curves as shown in Fig. 2b. The calculated carrier concentration is 8.1 × 1017 cm−3 for the C-AgBiS2 film and 2.5 × 1017 cm−3 for the M-AgBiS2 film. The reduced carrier concentration probably results from the better stoichiometry of Ag and Bi. However, both the carrier concentrations are two orders higher that of a PbS quantum dot film treated with tetrabutylamine iodide.3 The mobility of the AgBiS2 nanocrystal film is much lower than that of a typical PbS quantum dot film treated with iodide salts (>0.05 cm2 V−1 s−1),3,27 and the carrier concentration of AgBiS2 NCs is much higher than that of the PbS quantum dot film. These are the reasons that the AgBiS2 nanocrystal film thickness of the champion device (<50 nm) is much smaller than that of a typical PbS quantum dot device (>250 nm).19,27 The mobility of the modified AgBiS2 film was also possibly improved by the improved size distribution via our modified synthesis route, which reduces scattering during transport in the nanoparticle films. With the knowledge of the mobility, the thickness of the AgBiS2 film in the solar cell was optimized, which will be discussed later.

(c) Dynamic current–time (I–t) curves for both control and modified AgBiS2 nanocrystal thin film devices. Increases in the measured currents for the modified AgBiS2 material are evident in both cases, which are consistent with improved carrier mobility and low defect concentration. 
Further, AgBiS2 nanocrystal photodetectors were fabricated to investigate their photoconduction response. Control and modified AgBiS2 nanocrystals were deposited on glasses with pre-patterned interdigitated gold electrodes and then treated with a TMAI in methanol solution. The device was tested under illumination with a 760 nm light emitting diode at 3.6 μW cm−2, which was controlled by a function generator and 5 V bias voltage. Dynamic current–time (I–t) curves of the two photodetectors are shown in Fig. 2c, which demonstrate that the photocurrent of the modified AgBiS2 nanocrystal device was significantly improved. The ratio of photocurrent to dark current is 2.17 for the control AgBiS2 device and 2.55 for the modified AgBiS2 device. The detectivity can be calculated using eqn (4) (4)where Ip is the photocurrent, Id is the dark current, A is the device area (0.015 cm2), P is the light power intensity illuminated on the device, and q is the elementary charge. The detectivity is 6.8 × 108 Jones for the modified device and 5.7 × 108 Jones for the control device. These results showed that the modified AgBiS2 photodetector has an enhanced detectivity, but it is at least two orders of magnitude lower than that of a PbS quantum dot detector.7 These results are ascribed to the poor charge transport between AgBiS2 nanocrystals.
Solar cells were prepared with a device structure consisting of an ITO/ZnO/AgBiS2/P3HT/Au layer stack. The modified and control AgBiS2 nanocrystals were deposited on the ZnO films by spin-coating in a layer by layer approach. They were both treated with 1 mg ml−1 TMAI methanol solution for 20 s to replace insulating OA and OLA ligands with the atomic iodide ions, and then rinsed with pure methanol twice. The tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the modified and control AgBiS2 films are given in Fig. 3a and b, respectively. The results show that the average roughness is 2.1 nm for the M-AgBiS2 film and 9.4 nm for the C-AgBiS2 film. These results suggest that the M-AgBiS2 film is more uniform and smooth compared with the C-AgBiS2 film probably due to the former having better ligand attachment, which likely makes the nanocrystals pack regularly in the film. Improvements in the ligand surface coverage may result from OA terminating exposed Bi atoms at the nanoparticle surface, with exposed Ag and S atoms being terminated by OLA due to the preference these atoms have to complex with amine groups. Films were fabricated using 3 to 6 spin coats to tune the film thickness and optimize the device performance. Fig. 3c shows the cross-sectional SEM image of a complete device with 5 coats of the modified AgBiS2 nanocrystals.

(c) An SEM image of the cross section of a complete solar cell device made using 5 coats of the modified AgBiS2 nanocrystals. An absorber layer thickness of approximately 65 nm is obtained for the 5 coat deposition. 
The effect of nanocrystal film thickness was investigated. The relationship between the thickness of the active layer and charge transport is mutually restricting in solar cells because a thicker film increases incident light absorption but limits charge transport. The ideal conditions for the solar cell are that all incident light is absorbed to generate carriers, and then all generated carriers are completely collected by electrodes. Therefore, the optimal thickness for a solar cell should be selected based on device performance. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.3% was achieved for a solar cell fabricated with absorber films made from 5-layers of modified AgBiS2. The highest PCE attainable using conventional AgBiS2 was 3.4%, obtained in a solar cell fabricated with 4-layer NP films. There is a 26% improvement in the PCE for modified solar cells compared with conventional solar cells. The current–voltage (J–V) curves of modified and conventional champion devices are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively, and device parameters of the M-AgBiS2 and C-AgBiS2 solar cells are given in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. For the modified solar cell, the device performance substantially increased from 3 layers to 5 layers in the absorber film, but the performance of a 6 layer solar cell slightly decreased. For the conventional solar cell, the best device with 3.3% PCE was achieved with a 4-layer absorber film and the device efficiency of a 6-layer film solar cell sharply decreased to 1.8%. As mentioned above, the mobility is one of the key parameters for carrier diffusion length. An increased mobility can increase the thickness of the active layer, which leads to absorption of more incident light without sacrificing the carrier collection efficiency. These results indicate that the charge transport in the M-AgBiS2 film has been improved compared with that of the C-AgBiS2 film due to its improved mobility, which significantly enhances the solar cell performance. To verify the current density, external quantum efficiency measurements were carried out on champion devices of M-AgBiS2 and C-AgBiS2 solar cells. Fig. 4c shows the EQE curves of the champion solar cells fabricated with C-AgBiS2 and M-AgBiS2 nanocrystals. The EQE curves show that the champion device of the M-AgBiS2 solar cell has higher EQE over the whole spectrum, suggesting that it has higher current density. The integrated photocurrents obtained from EQE results were 15.3 mA cm−2 for the M-AgBiS2 champion device and 14.3 mA cm−2 for the C-AgBiS2 champion device, which is in good agreement with their J–V curves.
 Fig. 4  
J–V curves for solar cells fabricated from the (a) control AgBiS2 and (b) modified AgBiS2 nanocrystals. Overall improvements in both the Jsc and Voc values are evident from the curves. Increases in the fill factor (FF) are also evident, implying improvements in the mobility–lifetime product. The optimal number of layers was 4 and 5 in the conventional and modified AgBiS2 devices respectively. The EQEs of the champion conventional and modified AgBiS2 devices are shown in (c). An overall higher charge collection at all wavelengths is observed for nanocrystal films modified using the modified method. However, the improvements in the EQE are most pronounced for wavelengths likely collected in the bulk of the absorber layer away from the contacts. This is consistent with increased mobility in the modified AgBiS2 absorber layers.

Conclusion
A modified synthesis route of AgBiS2 nanocrystals was optimized using OLA to improve the dissolvability of the Ag precursor. This method produces AgBiS2 nanocrystals with better size distribution, element stoichiometry and ligand attachment, which could make nanocrystals more closely packed during film fabrication. These factors lead to improved carrier mobility, reduced carrier concentration and improved photosensitivity, and better performance of solar cells compared with those of C-AgBiS2 devices. The optimal thickness of a champion solar cell was increased from 35 nm to 65 nm, which opens the possibility of achieving higher PCE of the solar cell due to improved light absorption. Further, this modified synthesis route could be applied for the synthesis of other nanocrystals using silver, an increasingly important element for high efficiency solution processed materials and solar cells.

 	Fig. 1  (a) XRD patterns of the modified and control AgBiS2 nanocrystals showing a cubic rock salt structure. (b) XPS core-level spectra of the Ag 3d peak. TEM images of (c) the control and (d) modified AgBiS2 nanocrystals, showing improved size distribution in the modified synthesis in (d).	 
μ = L/(WVdsε0εr/d)dIds/dVg	(1)
σ = L/(RWD)	(2)
ρ = σ/(eμ)	(3)

 	Fig. 2  (a) Id–Vg curves of field effect transistor. (b) Id–Vd curves of field effect transistor. (c) Dynamic current–time (I–t) curves for both control and modified AgBiS2 nanocrystal thin film devices. Increases in the measured currents for the modified AgBiS2 material are evident in both cases, which are consistent with improved carrier mobility and low defect concentration.	 
	(4)

 	Fig. 3  AFM images showing the film uniformity after deposition by spin coating of (a) the modified AgBiS2 nanocrystals and (b) the conventional nanocrystals. (c) An SEM image of the cross section of a complete solar cell device made using 5 coats of the modified AgBiS2 nanocrystals. An absorber layer thickness of approximately 65 nm is obtained for the 5 coat deposition.	 

 	Fig. 4  
J–V curves for solar cells fabricated from the (a) control AgBiS2 and (b) modified AgBiS2 nanocrystals. Overall improvements in both the Jsc and Voc values are evident from the curves. Increases in the fill factor (FF) are also evident, implying improvements in the mobility–lifetime product. The optimal number of layers was 4 and 5 in the conventional and modified AgBiS2 devices respectively. The EQEs of the champion conventional and modified AgBiS2 devices are shown in (c). An overall higher charge collection at all wavelengths is observed for nanocrystal films modified using the modified method. However, the improvements in the EQE are most pronounced for wavelengths likely collected in the bulk of the absorber layer away from the contacts. This is consistent with increased mobility in the modified AgBiS2 absorber layers.
