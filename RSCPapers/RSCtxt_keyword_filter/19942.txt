    , Accepted 27th March 2016First published on 30th March 2016AbstractIn this study, a ZnO/ZnSe nanonail array was prepared via a two-step sequential hydrothermal synthetic route. In this synthetic process, the ZnO nanorod array was first grown on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate using a seed-mediated growth approach via the hydrothermal process. Then, the ZnO nanonail array was obtained via in situ growth of ZnSe nano caps onto the ZnO nanorod array via a hydrothermal process in the presence of a Se source. The surface morphology and amount of ZnSe grown on the surface of the ZnO nanorods can be regulated by varying the reaction time and reactant concentration. Compared with pure ZnO nanorods, this unique nanonail array heterostructure exhibits enhanced visible light absorption. The transient photocurrent condition, in combination with steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, reveals that the ZnO/ZnSe nanonail array electrode has the highest charge separation rate, highest electron injection efficiency, and highest chemical stability. The photocurrent density of the ZnO/ZnSe nanonail array heterostructure reaches 1.01 mA cm−2 at an applied potential of 0.1 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), which is much higher than that of the ZnO/ZnSe nanorod array (0.71 mA cm−2), the pristine ZnO nanorod array (0.39 mA cm−2), and the ZnSe electrode (0.21 mA cm−2), indicating its significant visible light driven activities for photoelectrochemical water oxidation. This unique morphology of nail-capped nanorods might be important for providing better insight into the correlation between heterostructure and photoelectrochemical activity.
1. Introduction
Using solar energy to produce clean hydrogen and oxygen supplies an efficient strategy for solving the energy crisis.1–6 Photocatalytic water splitting is known as “artificial photosynthesis” and provides a promising way for the low-cost, and environmentally friendly, production of hydrogen and oxygen from solar energy.7–10 However, the efficiency of photocatalytic water splitting is relatively low. Compared with simple photocatalytic water splitting, photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, which possesses the ability to convert solar energy and electric energy to chemical energy in a clean, pollution-free, low-cost way, is extremely attractive.11,12 In the past decades, O2 production was confirmed to be a four-hole process and supposed to be the most challenging step for water splitting.13 Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) photoelectrode materials for PEC water oxidation, have already become the focal point of investigative attention.14,15 For successful water splitting, the valence band of the material must have a greater positivity than the water oxidation potential (i.e., O2/H2O = +1.23 V). Therefore, a thermodynamic potential of 1.23 V is required to split water. Considering cathodic and anodic overpotentials and losses from electrochemical reactions, this potential must be much higher than 1.23 V. Thus, this high potential requires a high material bandgap. Semiconductor materials like TiO2,16,17 ZnO,18–20 SnO2,21 BiVO4,22 Fe2O3,23,24 WO3,25 TaON, and Ta3N526 were confirmed to be the promising oxide materials for use as a photoanode for PEC water oxidation. Among these materials, ZnO has attracted significant attention because of its perfect electron mobility and easy access.27 However, ZnO is a wide bandgap semiconductor material, and can only absorb 4% of solar energy, which is a long way from the dream of efficiency using solar energy.28 To solve this problem, some strategies have been adopted to broaden the absorption spectrum of ZnO to the visible light region. For example, hydrogenation and doping with a substitutional element have been studied to extend the photo-response to visible light. Other effective routes, including co-catalysis and heterostructures with narrow bandgap semiconductors, have also been utilized.29 As is known, multi-component semiconductor materials can both remedy defects of structures and alter the electronic properties of materials. As a consequence, ZnO based materials assisted with crystal growth during synthesis and creating catalytic sites on the surface, have led to improved performance of PEC water oxidation. ZnO-CdSe,30 ZnO-Au,31 Ag-ZnO,32 ZnO-ZnIn2S4, etc.33 have been reported in recent years for these purposes.
ZnSe, with a suitable band gap (2.67 eV), is an ideal material to extend the visible light absorption of ZnO by constructing composites.34–36 In the past few years, some ZnO/ZnSe nanocomposites have been successfully fabricated.37–39 Although there are some reports about the synthesis of ZnO/ZnSe thin films, the use of ZnO/ZnSe thin films for water oxidation in PEC cells is limited. The activity of this catalyst is shown to be closely associated with its shape and surface structure. To enhance the efficiency for PEC water oxidation under solar light, miscellaneous morphologies of ZnO material have been synthesized, such as nanorods, nanosheets, and nanodisks.40–45 One-dimensional (nanotube and nanorod) ZnO thin films were prepared and exhibited high performance PEC water oxidation due to the fact that one-dimensional nanostructures can provide a short diffusion length perpendicular to the charge for collecting substrate, yielding a low recombination of electron–hole pairs.46 But that is not enough. In recent years, ZnO nanonail arrays have been successfully prepared and have shown potential in applications such as optoelectronics and gas sensors.47 Previous studies showed that 2D/1D nano-heterojunctions demonstrate unique characteristics for applications in PEC cells. For example, a larger surface area can promote charge migration and allow multiple reflections and scattering at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. It is expected that the binary composite heterojunction of ZnO nanonails, with a small band gap material such as ZnSe, may further improve PEC water oxidation performance.
Herein, we report a facile method for the synthesis of ZnO/ZnSe nanonail arrays on transparent FTO glass substrates via a facile two-step hydrothermal process. As depicted in Scheme 1, the ZnO nanorod arrays were first grown on the FTO substrate through the hydrothermal process via a seed-mediated growth approach, and a subsequent hydrothermal process causes the formation of the nail-like morphology from in situ generation and growth of ZnSe nanocaps on the ZnO nanorod via an in situ ion exchange reaction. Simultaneously, ZnSe nanobelts are also in situ formed and cover the surface of the ZnO nanorods. The morphologies of the ZnO/ZnSe heterostructure can be rationally controlled by varying the reaction time. The introduction of ZnSe can largely extend the visible light absorption edge. Moreover, formation of the ZnO/ZnSe heterostructure allows an effective transfer of photoexcited electrons and holes, playing a significant role in enhancing PEC water oxidation performance.

2. Experimental details
2.1 Preparation of ZnO seed layer
A ZnO seed layer was deposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates by a dip-coating method. Firstly, the FTO glasses were ultrasonically rinsed for 30 min in acetone, ethanol, and deionized water, sequentially. A droplet of 0.005 M zinc acetate hexahydrate in ethanol was dripped onto the FTO substrate and then blown dry with a stream of nitrogen. This step was repeated several times and then the substrates were annealed with the seed layer at 350 °C for 120 min.
2.2 Synthesis of the ZnO nanorod arrays
1.1157 g zinc nitrate hydrate (0.025 M) and 0.5256 g hexamethylenetetramine (0.025 M) was added to 50 mL of deionized water. Then, the mixture was stirred until the solid completely dissolved as the ZnO growth solution. Then, the growth solution was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and the as-prepared FTO glass was immersed into this solution. The hydrothermal reaction was carried out at 95 °C for 8 h. After cooling to room temperature, the obtained ZnO nanorod (ZnO NR) array films were washed with ethanol and dried at 60 °C.
2.3 Fabrication of the ZnO/ZnSe nanonail arrays
0.1184 g selenium powder and 0.2270 g sodium borohydride was added into 30 mL of deionized water followed by ultrasonication until the solution turned clear. Then, 0.3290 g zinc acetate hexahydrate was added into the above solution and magnetically stirred for 10 min. Finally, the obtained cream solution was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and the as-prepared ZnO NR films (step 2.2) was immersed into this solution and heated to 180 °C for 20 min. After cooling to room temperature, the ZnO/ZnSe nanonail arrays (ZnO/ZnSe NN) films were washed with ethanol and dried at 60 °C.
2.4 Characterization
The obtained products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å). The morphology of the obtained products was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800, Japan) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 2100, Japan). Sample preparation was done by applying one drop of the sample dispersion to a carbon-coated copper grid, followed immediately by blotting off all excess solution with filter paper. The optical properties of the films were analyzed by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS) using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2550). The electronic states of the elements in the sample were analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos-AXIS ULTRA DLD, Al Ka X-ray source). Raman spectra were recorded on a Horiba Jobin Yvon HR 800 micro-Raman spectrometer with laser radiation at 457.9 nm. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Optima 7000DV, PerkinElmer) was used to measure material content. The scanning Kelvin probe (SKP) measurements (SKP5050 system, Scotland) were performed under normal laboratory conditions in an ambient atmosphere. A gold electrode was used as the reference electrode. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were taken using a FL920 spectrofluorometer (Edinburgh Instruments) with the photoexcitation wavelength set at 350 nm. Luminescence lifetimes were recorded on a single photon counting spectrometer using a microsecond pulse lamp as the excitation source (375 nm). The data were analyzed using software supplied by Edinburgh Instruments.
2.5 PEC measurements
PEC measurements were determined by a Princeton Versa STAT 3 in a standard three-compartment cell containing 200 mL of 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 solution that was purged with nitrogen for 10 min prior to the measurement. The ZnO/ZnSe nanonail array on FTO electrode (1 × 1 cm) was used as the working electrode, a Pt slice as the counter electrode, and a saturated Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. Photocurrents of the samples were obtained under solar simulator lighting using a 150 W Xe lamp with a 1.5 AM filter, and visible light using a 150 W Xe lamp by with a 420 nm cutoff filter. The potential was swept from −0.3 to +0.7 V (versus Ag/AgCl) at a sweeping rate of 10 mV s−1.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural characterization of ZnO/ZnSe nanonail arrays
The morphology of the synthesized ZnO nanorods and ZnO/ZnSe nanonails was characterized by field emission SEM. The statistic histograms of the length and width of ZnO nanorods and ZnO/ZnSe nanonails are presented in Fig. S1.† The low magnification image of the ZnO nanorod array in Fig. 1A clearly shows high-density ZnO nanorods vertically aligned on the FTO substrate. The enlarged view in Fig. 1B shows the mean diameter of the nanorods was about 70 ± 30 nm (statistic histograms in Fig. S1B†) and the cross-section is aligned with the c-axis of the hexagonal ZnO crystal structure. Fig. 1C and D show the low and high magnification SEM images of the ZnO/ZnSe nanonail heterostructure, respectively. The morphology looks distinct from the ZnO nanorods. As compared with the pristine ZnO nanorods, the ultrathin caps appeared on top of the nanorods, which were around 150 nm in diameter and only about 1 to 3 nm thick. Belt-like ZnSe embraces the surface of the ZnO nanorods. This result suggests that the formation of ZnO/ZnSe nanonails and ZnSe nanoparticles were uniformly assembled on the whole surface of the ZnO NRs. After selenation, the mean diameter of the nanorods increases to 100 ± 30 nm (statistic histograms in Fig. S1D†). The cross-sectional images in Fig. S2† show the gradual change of the surface morphology of the nanoarray from smooth nanorods to nanonails with a nanosheet shell and nanorods with nanoparticles on the surface. The ZnO nanorods and ZnO/ZnSe nanonails have similar lengths of 1.15 ± 0.3 μm.

To further clarify the microscopic structure and morphology of the ZnO/ZnSe nanonails, a more detailed investigation was conducted via TEM. Fig. 2A shows a typical nanonail structure, and the ultrathin nanocap closely grew on top of the nanorod. Meanwhile, ZnSe nanobelts embrace the surface of the ZnO nanorod. The high-resolution TEM image in Fig. 2B was taken from a selected area of Fig. 2A. It can be seen that a heterojunction marked with the red arrow is formed on the whole nanorod surface, which is beneficial to charge separation during PEC applications. Partial interface diffusion between the ZnSe shell and ZnO core might have occurred, as indicated by the two-phase heterogeneous interface compared with the pristine single-crystalline ZnO nanorod with smooth surfaces (Fig. 2B). Lattice fringe spacing of 0.28 nm and 0.33 nm correspond to the (100) lattice plane of the hexagonal ZnO crystal and the (111) lattice plane of the cubic ZnSe, respectively.52 Particles circled by the red dotted line corresponds to the ZnSe nanoparticles, which can also be found on the surface of the nanocap in the SEM image (Fig. 1D). Owing to the high reactivity of the edge sites of 2D sheet structure, ZnSe nanoparticles preferentially formed on the edge of the nanocaps.48 The presence of a polycrystalline ZnSe on a monocrystalline ZnO structure was also confirmed by the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern in the inset of Fig. 2B.
 Fig. 2  (A) and (B) are the TEM and HRTEM images of the ZnO/ZnSe NNs, respectively. (C–E) are the element mappings of O, Zn, and Se in the region shown in TEM image (A). 
The EDS element mapping of Zn, O, Se (Fig. 2C–E) from a selected area in Fig. 2A illustrates that the elemental distributions are consistent with the structure of ZnO/ZnSe nanonails. Elemental mapping further confirmed that the localized O element in the filled core area and the O element was uniformly distributed over the whole cross-section of the nanorod, while the element distribution diameters of Se and Zn are larger than that of the O element, indicating that ZnSe covered the outside of the ZnO nanorod. The mass percentage of ZnSe in the ZnO/ZnSe NNs composite was about 9.3% according to the result ICP-OES, which is in agreement with the results from EDS.
The XRD patterns (A) and Raman spectra (B) were used to identify the crystal structure of the samples. As shown in Fig. 3A. All the diffraction peaks in the pattern a can be accurately indexed to hexagonal ZnO (PDF#36-1451) and all the diffraction peaks in pattern b can be accurately indexed to ZnSe (PDF#37-1463). All the diffraction peaks in pattern c have obvious strong peaks that could be easily indicated to the crystal planes of both ZnO and ZnSe, and no supernumerary diffraction peaks can be observed, effectively demonstrating that the nanonails were made up of ZnO and ZnSe. In Fig. 3B, the strong Raman peaks at 248 cm−1 and 437 cm−1 are attributed to LO phonon of ZnSe and active optical-phonon E2 mode of ZnO, respectively, demonstrating the coexistence of ZnO and ZnSe. However, it is seen that all Raman peaks of the ZnO/ZnSe NNs shift slightly compared with the positions of pure ZnO and ZnSe, which might be attributed to the interaction between ZnO and ZnSe.

The SEM images in Fig. 4 demonstrated the formation process of ZnO/ZnSe nanonail arrays for different selenization times (0, 20, 30, and 60 min). It can be seen that, with the extension of reaction time, the surface morphology has a significant change. Nanorods with a smooth surface changed into nanonails with a rough surface. Furthermore, the nanocaps disappeared after 30 min and nanoparticles uniformly covered the outer surface of the nanorods. Finally, the nanorod arrays vanished and completely transformed into ZnSe nanosheets. The corresponding EDS spectrum in Fig. S3(C)† shows that elements of O and Se can both be clearly observed. Moreover, with the extension of reaction time, the Se element content gradually increases, proving the gradual increase of the ZnSe content in the composite. To further confirm the composition, the valence states of the ZnO/ZnSe nanonail array composite are characterized by XPS measurements, as shown in Fig. S4.† The full scan spectrum indicates the presence of the Zn 2p, O1s, and Se 3d peaks in the sample (Fig. S4A†) with no obvious impurities detected. The Zn 2p core (Fig. S4B†) splits into 2p3/2 (1021.70 eV) and 2p1/2 (1044.72 eV) peaks, which are consistent with the values for Zn2+. The oxygen peak at a binding energy of 532.0 eV (Fig. S4C†) originates from H2O absorbed on the sample surface. The Se 3d (Fig. S4D†) region shows one peak attributed to Se2− (reduced) state at 54 eV.49 All these results indicate that the chemical states of the sample are Zn2+, O2−, and Se2−.

Based on the experimental results, the formation process of the ZnO/ZnSe nanonail arrays is shown in Scheme 1. This process can be speculated to be anion exchange during the dissolution-recrystallization process. ZnO nanorods were first prepared by using a seed-mediated growth approach via the hydrothermal process. In this reaction system, NaHSe precursor, which was obtained from the reduction of the Se powder in NaBH4, provided Se2− anions that can stably exist in alkaline conditions (reaction (1)). Subsequently, hydroxyl anions slowly dissolve the surfaces of ZnO nanorods and released Zn(OH)42− from the surfaces of the ZnO nanorods (reaction (2)). Meanwhile, the formed Zn(OH)42− can regenerate ZnO on the top cap area of the ZnO nanorods, as it is the energetically favored area. In this way, the top area of the ZnO nanorods grew along the [001] direction within the transverse direction, resulting in the formation of a nail-like shape.50 In this reaction system, the inter-diffusion of Zn2+, O2−, and Se2− ions can proceed sufficiently because the ZnO nanorod diameter (∼70 nm) was less than the diffusion mean-free path of the reactive ions (∼80 nm).51 Furthermore, the concentration of Zn(OH)42− increases and reacts with Se2− to produce ZnSe nanoparticle seeds by heterogeneous nucleation on the surfaces of the ZnO nanorods (reaction (3)). High distribution density and the proper distance between the adjacent ZnO nanonails provide a good opportunity for the uniform conversion of ZnSe nanostructures onto the large exposed surfaces of the ZnO nanonails. Then, most of the ZnSe seeds further grow into nanosheet shells. After ZnO nanonails completely dissolved, the formed Zn(OH)42− ions (reaction (4)) continue to react with Se2− (reaction (5)), and finally form ZnSe nanosheet films. 4NaBH4 + 2Se + 7H2O → 2NaHSe + Na2B4O7 + 14H2↑(1) ZnO + H2O + 2OH− → Zn(OH)42−(2) Se2− + Zn(OH)42− → ZnSe + 4OH−(3) Zn2+ + 4OH− → Zn(OH)42−(4) Se2− + Zn(OH)42− → ZnSe + 4OH−(5)
3.2 Optical properties of the ZnO/ZnSe nanonail arrays
The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra were used to evaluate the optical properties of the products. As shown in Fig. 5, the spectra revealed significant differences in the optical absorption properties of the ZnO NRs, ZnO/ZnSe NNs, and ZnSe NSs. The UV-vis absorption spectrum of the synthesized ZnO NRs exhibited a strong absorption in the ultraviolet region, located at about 390 nm, near the visible region, which corresponds to the large band gap of 3.18 eV. However, the ZnO/ZnSe NNs displayed strong absorption in the visible region between 400 nm and 700 nm, which was ascribed to the introduction of narrow band gap ZnSe (2.67 eV) on the surface of the ZnO NRs. The enhanced absorption for photon energy below the direct band gap may be due to the presence of some defects lying in the band gap, and trace amounts of amorphous Se formed from the oxidation of Se2− ions on the surface of the ZnSe shell in air.52 The enhanced visible light absorption demonstrated that it could produce more photo-generated charges in the visible light region.

3.3 Charge carrier dynamics in heterostructured ZnO/ZnSe nanonail arrays
The separation of photo-generated charges plays an important role in PEC catalysis. To understand the charge separation process for the heterostructured ZnO/ZnSe nanonail arrays, steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence studies were carried out. Fig. 6A shows steady-state photoluminescence decay spectra of ZnO, ZnO/ZnSe NNs, and ZnSe. The absorbance spectra show little change upon the modification with ZnSe, the broad emission at around 580 nm that is related with the charge carrier relaxation via surface-related trap states are found to be drastically quenched in the presence of ZnSe.53 The observed significant quenching of ZnO PL emission in ZnO/ZnSe NNs is due to suppressed recombination of photo-generated charges, implying the effective electron transfer from ZnSe to ZnO because it is well established that ZnSe promotes interfacial charge transfer processes.
 Fig. 6  (A) Room-temperature PL spectra of samples: (a) ZnO NRs, (b) ZnO/ZnSe NNs, and (c) ZnO/ZnSe NRs; (B) PL decay curves of samples: (a) ZnO NRs, (b) ZnO/ZnSe NNs, and (c) ZnO/ZnSe NRs. 
To further understand the charge transfer process between ZnO and ZnSe, a time-resolved PL study of ZnO and ZnO/ZnSe nanonail arrays was carried out, as shown in Fig. 6B. PL lifetimes of the band edge emission were measured using a 350 nm laser as the excitation source. The PL lifetime depends upon both the radiative and non-radiative processes and thus, its change can reveal a particular deactivation process.49,54 The decay profile is fitted most reasonably by a bi-exponential model.54,55Table 1 summarizes the time constants and relative amplitudes from the bi-exponential fits. For ZnO, the fast decay component (τ1) in Table 1 can be attributed to non-radiative recombination of near surface excitons. The slow component (τ2) can be attributed to the radiative recombination of the free excitons.54,56 While the fast decay lifetime is rather insensitive to the presence of ZnSe, the slow component appears to be considerably affected by the presence of ZnSe. The PL lifetime τ2 of the ZnO/ZnSe NNs (3.84 ns) is significantly shorter than that of ZnO (7.64 ns). This result suggests that the formation of ZnSe on the ZnO surface provides an additional deactivation pathway corresponding to the electron transfer from ZnSe to ZnO, leading to a significant decrease in the PL lifetime. The steady state and time resolved spectroscopic studies unambiguously confirm that electrons transfer from photoexcited ZnSe to ZnO, which contributes to better PDC performance.

3.4 PEC water oxidation performance of ZnO/ZnSe nanonail array electrodes
PEC properties of the ZnO/ZnSe nanonail arrays were studied. Fig. 7A shows a set of linear sweep voltammograms measured from the nanostructure photoanodes in 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution in the dark and under illumination by AM 1.5G simulated solar light. All the samples exhibited very low dark current densities. Under AM 1.5G simulated solar light illumination, both ZnO/ZnSe heterostructure arrays exhibited significantly higher photocurrents compared to the pristine ZnO NRs. ZnO/ZnSe NNs exhibited a significantly improved photocurrent density of 1.01 mA cm−2, which was almost a 0.5-fold enhancement of the ZnO/ZnSe NRs (0.71 mA cm−2) and 3 times as high as that of the ZnO NRs (0.39 mA cm−2) at 0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl. These results can be rationalized by considering that the vertically aligned ZnSe nano cap on the top of the ZnO nanorods and ZnSe nanobelts embrace the surface of ZnO nanorods to have direct electron transport pathways and a large electrode–electrolyte interface, thus benefiting electron transport in the photoanode and facilitate oxidation of water at the interface.57 Meanwhile, improved visible light absorption caused by the introduction of ZnSe nanostructures can also remarkably increase PEC activity in the visible light region.

Transient photocurrent density–time curves of both ZnO NRs and ZnO/ZnSe hetero-nanostructured materials recorded under chopped light illumination at 0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl were constant in Fig. 7B. The current densities of all the samples were close to zero in the dark. When the simulated solar illumination suddenly turns on, the photocurrents peak and then tends to be steady. The photocurrent density of the ZnO and ZnSe samples are 0.39 mA cm−2 and 0.21 mA cm−2, respectively, while the ZnO/ZnSe NRs increased to 0.71 mA cm−2. These surprising findings that the value of ZnO/ZnSe NNs reaches 1.01 mA cm−2 revealed increased PEC water oxidation activity. It is possible to achieve a more homogeneous coating of the ZnO nanorods with ZnSe and form core–shell heterogeneous nanonail arrays. The increased interface areas and interface uniformity can contribute to an enhanced PEC water oxidation performance. Moreover, there was no conspicuous attenuation of the photocurrent density after five cycles, which perfectly demonstrated its high stability.
Meanwhile, linear sweep voltammograms and transient photocurrent density–time curves from the different photoanodes were also measured under visible light (λ > 420 nm) irradiation (Fig. S5†). The ZnO/ZnSe NNs (0.92 mA cm−2) displayed significantly improved photocurrent density compared to ZnO/ZnSe NRs (0.59 mA cm−2) and ZnO NRs (0.05 mA cm−2) at 0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively. The lowest photocurrent density of the pristine ZnO NRs can be ascribed to its wide band gap (3.2 eV) and poorer electron–hole separation. The enhanced PEC performance of the ZnO/ZnSe NNs photoanode can be attributed to its enhanced visible light utilization and electron injection efficiency accomplished through the formation of a heterojunction at the interface of the ZnO nanorod core and the ZnSe shell in the nanonail.
Moreover, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopies in Fig. 8A were used to evaluate electron transfer resistance at the electrode surface. Nyquist plots collected from the photoanodes corresponded to the electron transfer resistance value, suggesting that the Faradaic charge transfer is limiting for the oxidation process at the electrode surface. Obviously, the arc diameter for the typical ZnO/ZnSe NNs was much smaller than that of the ZnO/ZnSe NRs and pristine ZnO NRs. The charge transfer resistance of the ZnO/ZnSe NNs is somewhat smaller than that of the other two samples, which indicates that the formation of the ZnSe shell increased the electron mobility by suppressing the recombination of photoexcited electrons and holes, and could partially account for its higher PEC performance. In other words, the ZnO/ZnSe nanonail heterostructure photoanode can make charge separation more efficient, which is further supported by the steady-state emission spectra and transient absorption results (Fig. 6). Moreover, the Mott–Schottky plots in the dark, Fig. 8B, revealed that the ZnO/ZnSe heterostructure has a positive slope, which means it is an n-type semiconductor with electrons as the major carriers. The negative change of the flat band potential of ZnO/ZnSe NNs signified a higher carrier concentration and more efficient electron transfer from the external ZnSe shell to the inner ZnO nanorod. Furthermore, the ZnO/ZnSe NNs exhibited an obvious improvement in the carrier density compared to both ZnO/ZnSe NRs and the pristine ZnO NRs. The enlarged electron density in the ZnO/ZnSe NNs is believed to be a dominant factor for the pronounced photocurrent density enhancement.

To more definitely judge the collection yield of the photo-generated charge carriers, the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) and absorbed photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (APCE) values have been calculated from eqn (6) and (7) below: IPCE(λ) = (1239.8 × I)/(λ × Plight)(6)where I is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2), λ is the incident light wavelength (nm), and Plight (mW cm−2) is the power density of monochromatic light at a specific wavelength and APCE = IPCE/(1 − T)(7)where T is the light transmittance.58 As shown in Fig. 9, the ZnO/ZnSe NNs cell presents higher IPCE and APCE values than both the ZnO NRs cell and the ZnO/ZnSe NRs cell from 300 nm to 700 nm. The IPCE of the former ZnO/ZnSe NNs cell reaches 69.37% at 450 nm, which is higher than that of the ZnO/ZnSe NRs cell of 57.79%, and about 7 times as high as the ZnO NRs cell of 10.30% (Fig. 9A). The APCE values had a similar trend (Fig. 9B). The results demonstrated that the nanonail array structure and light-absorbing properties of the ZnO/ZnSe composite substantially enhanced the photon-to-current conversion efficiency.

The fill factor (ff) of the PEC cells can be calculated from the equation, ff = Pmax/(JSC × VOC) = (Im × Vm)/(JSC × VOC)(8)where Pmax is taken to be the largest value of the measured power, JSC is the short circuit photocurrent density, and VOC is the open circuit voltage.59 The ZnO/ZnSe NNs cell exhibited JSC and VOC values of 1.02 mA cm−2 and 0.34 V, respectively, and showed a fill factor (ff) of 0.46.
Based on the above analysis, the electron-transfer path during the PEC water splitting process over the ZnO/ZnSe NNs is illustrated in Fig. 10B. The valence band maximums (VBM) of the ZnO and ZnO/ZnSe nanonail array composites were characterized by XPS. The valence band spectra of the two samples are illustrated in Fig. 10A. The VBM of each electrode were determined to be 2.24 and 0.88 eV below the Fermi level for ZnO and ZnO/ZnSe, respectively. On the basis of the band gap results and the VBM, the positions of the conduction band minimum (CBM) could also be determined. The positions of conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) of ZnSe are both higher than that of ZnO, respectively, which means type II energy band alignment was formed.60 As a consequence, photoinduced electrons are excited from the VB to the CB of both ZnO and ZnSe, the electrons in the CB of ZnSe are then transferred to the CB of ZnO, and then the separated electrons go through the external circuit to produce oxygen. Meanwhile, the holes in the VB of ZnO are transferred to that of ZnSe, leading to excellent charge separation capability, which is proved by the steady-state emission, time-resolved photoluminescence (Fig. 6), and work function test results (Fig. 10C and D).61 Work function is strongly dependent on the surface charge distribution of materials. Changes of the surface chemical composition and physical structures of the materials will influence the surface charges, which will eventually alter the work function of the materials.62 The scanning Kelvin probe (SKP) is a highly sensitive equipment applied to survey the surface work function (φ) that can decide the direction of interface electric fields and thus prove the electronic properties. From the potential change in the SKP work-function images (Fig. 10C and D), information on the built-in electric field can be obtained. The surface work function value of ZnO nanorods (5.10 eV) is larger than that of the ZnO/ZnSe NNs (4.80 eV). This can accelerate photoelectron transfer from the surface ZnSe layer to the inner ZnO rods and then to the external circuit, which greatly reduces the opportunity of electron–hole recombination, and hence, substantially increases PEC activity.

4. Conclusions
In summary, ZnO/ZnSe nanonail arrays with controlled morphology have been prepared via a two-step hydrothermal process. By changing reaction time and reactant concentration, the ZnSe amount and surface morphology are both easy to control. Compared with pristine ZnO and ZnO/ZnSe nanorod arrays, the fabricated ZnO/ZnSe nanonail arrays exhibit enhanced visible light absorption abilities and effective charge separation due to its special nanonail heterostructure. The ZnO/ZnSe nanonail arrays exhibited significantly enhanced visible light driven activities in PEC water oxidation. This work also develops a better understanding for the correlation between the hetero-nanoarchitecture and photoelectrochemical activity. The fabricated ZnO/ZnSe nanonail arrays can also be applied in other photocatalytic application fields (e.g., photovoltaic cells and organic degradation).
