    , Accepted 28th July 2011First published on 22nd August 2011AbstractA general chemical approach was used to synthesise NiO–CdS core–shell nanoparticle films as photocathodes for p-type semiconductor-sensitized solar cells. Compared to dye-sensitized NiO photocathodes, the CdS-sensitized NiO cathodes exhibited two orders of magnitude faster hole transport (attributable to the passivation of surface traps by the CdS) and almost 100% charge-collection efficiencies.

        Nickel oxide (NiO) has attracted attention as an electrode material for electrochromic devices, supercapacitors, and Li-ion batteries.1–4 Because NiO displays p-type conductivity, it has also been used as a photocathode material in tandem sensitized photoelectrochemical (PEC) solar cells.5 Recently, it was reported that a dye-sensitized NiO photocathode could, when coupled to a dye-sensitized photoanode, significantly increase the overall conversion efficiency.6 However, the conversion efficiency of the cell was still low. There has been much effort to improve the conversion efficiency by fabricating NiO films with improved transport properties7 and developing more effective sensitizing dyes for p-NiO.8 Using a coumarin dye in combination with an iodide-based electrolyte, conversion efficiencies as high as 0.033% were obtained.8
The low conversion efficiencies of these p-NiO-based DSSCs are believed to stem from (1) a low open-circuit voltage (Voc) (∼0.1 V) resulting from the small difference in potential between the quasi-Femi level in the NiO photocathode and the redox potential of the I3−/I−-based electrolyte,9 (2) moderate short-circuit current densities (Jsc) owing to a low dye loading and rapid recombination of photoinjected holes in the NiO with the reduced dye,10 and (3) a low fill factor resulting from the high series resistance associated with the low hole conductivity in p-NiO.11 One approach toward improving the conversion efficiency of NiO photocathodes is to replace the dye with an inorganic semiconductor sensitizer.12,13 Potential advantages of inorganic semiconductors as sensitizers are the high extinction coefficient for improved light absorption, tunability of band gap energies for proper positioning of the valence-band edge for facilitating higher hole injection efficiency, and smaller hole transport resistance for faster transport.
In this communication, we describe the preparation of NiO nanoparticle films conformally covered with a thin layer of CdS as well as the charge-carrier dynamics and the photoelectrochemical properties of CdS-sensitized NiO solar cells.

        NiO nanostructured films (∼1 μm thick) were prepared by the spin-casting method using a slurry of commercial NiO powder (<50 nm particle size) followed by sintering at 450 °C. A thin layer of CdS was deposited on the surface of nanocrystalline NiO films by chemical bath deposition.14,15 Reaction byproducts were removed, and the crystallinity of the CdS layer was increased by annealing the as-deposited CdS sensitized NiO film at 250 °C under N2. Cells containing NiO films that were exposed to a CdS bath for 20 minutes yielded the highest incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE; Fig. S1, ESI†). Unless otherwise stated, the studies described in this communication are for a 20 minute deposition time. The charge transport and recombination kinetics were characterized by using intensity modulated photocurrent and photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS/IMVS).
The morphologies of the pure and CdS sensitized NiO nanoparticle films were examined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 1a shows that the post-annealed NiO nanoparticle films consist of polydisperse particles with a broad size distribution, ranging from 15 nm to 50 nm. The high resolution image in Fig. 1b shows that the crystalline NiO nanoparticles have a lattice spacing of 0.241 nm corresponding to the (111) plane of the face-centered cubic NiO phase (JCPDS 4-835).16Fig. 1c displays the NiO nanoparticle following deposition of CdS. The high-magnification image (Fig. 1d) along with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, inset of Fig. 1d) measurement reveals that the chemically deposited CdS layer covers the NiO surface. It can be seen that the edge areas (P1) are composed of Cd and S, whereas regions further from the particle edge (P2) consist of Ni and O in addition to Cd and S. In addition, close inspection of the high resolution TEM image in Fig. 1e reveals that the CdS layer appears to conformally coat the NiO particle, albeit with varying thicknesses. In the same image, a lattice spacing of 0.333 nm was observed, corresponding to the (111) plane of the cubic CdS phase (JPCDS 80-0019).17 The EDX data in Fig. 1f further confirm the presence of the CdS surface coating on the NiO nanoparticles. Notably, only trace amounts of Ni and O are observed in the EDX analysis (Fig. 1f) marked by the approximately 10 nm diameter circle in Fig. 1e, suggesting that the CdS layer thickness is on the order of 10 nm. X-Ray diffraction analysis (Fig. S2, ESI†) further confirmed that the nanoparticle composites are composed of both crystalline cubic NiO and CdS phases.

Fig. 2 shows the IPCE spectra of CdS-sensitized NiO and bare (nonsensitized) NiO films. Compared to the bare NiO electrode, which showed a zero IPCE, the CdS-sensitized NiO electrode displayed much larger photoresponse at wavelengths below ∼550 nm; the maximum IPCE response of the sensitized NiO was 12% at 370 nm. The IPCE response is consistent with the absorption spectrum of CdS coated on NiO (Fig. S3, ESI†), suggesting that the photocurrent is a result of the injection of holes from the photoexcited CdS into the NiO. From the IPCE spectrum, the band gap of the CdS material was estimated to be 2.2 eV, which agrees with the results of thin layers of CdS prepared viachemical bath deposition.18 When the CoII/IIItris(4,4′-di-tert-butyl-2,2′-dipyridyl)perchlorate electrolyte was used, the NiO–CdS photocathode showed 100-fold less IPCE than that using the sulfide/polysulfide electrolyte (Fig. S4, ESI†). The lower IPCE for the CoII/III electrolyte is likely due to mass transport limitations in the more viscous CoII/III electrolyte and the more rapid recombination associated with a reversible one-electron CoII/IIIredox couple compared with the multiple electron sulfide/polysulfide redox couple.

It is noteworthy that photovoltage at an open circuit under simulated AM 1.5 illumination (Fig. S5, ESI†) is 0.35 V, which is among the highest values reported to date.6,9 Assuming that the position of the quasi-Femi level for holes in NiO is 0.2 V lower in energy than that of the NiO valence band (−5.0 eV),19 we attribute the high Voc to the relatively large energy difference (0.6 eV) between the quasi-Femi level (−4.8 eV) of NiO and the redox potential (−4.2 eV) of the polysulfide electrolyte.

Fig. 3 shows the time constants of charge transport (τc) and recombination (τr) in the CdS-sensitized NiO solar cells as functions of short-circuit current (Jsc). The time constants for charge transport are almost constant over the entire Jsc range, whereas the time constants for charge recombination show a power-law dependence on Jsc. For photoanodes based on TiO2 nanocrystalline films, the power-law dependence of τc on Jsc is normally attributed to charges undergoing multiple trapping and detrapping through a network of traps with an exponential distribution of energy levels.20 Assuming that the same multiple trapping and detrapping process takes place in NiO nanoparticle electrodes, the constant transport times over the wide range of light intensities suggest that the transport-limiting traps in NiO electrodes are located close to a single energy level (e.g., point defect from Ni vacancies) above the valence band edge.21 From the film thickness (1 μm) and transport time constant (1.5 × 10−4 s; average value), we estimated22 a hole diffusion coefficient of 2.8 × 10−5 cm2 s−1. It is noteworthy that the value of D was about two orders of magnitude higher than the previously observed value of D for a dye-sensitized NiO cell.9 The much faster transport in CdS–NiO cells is presumably due to the strong influence that surface states have in determining the charge-carrier dynamics. For instance, in dye-sensitized TiO2 nanoparticle films, surface traps limit electron transport.23 Also, the hole diffusion coefficients in porous NiO nanoparticle films19 depend strongly on the cations (e.g., Li+ and Na+) used in the electrolyte; the extent to which a cation adsorbs onto the NiO surface depends on its adsorption property. Thus, we attribute the faster hole transport to the reduction of the surface trap density by the conformal coverage of the NiO surface with CdS. The transport property of the NiO film is also expected to depend on the morphological details of the NiO film (e.g., shape, size, and porosity), requiring further investigation. Fig. 3 shows that the hole recombination time constants (lifetimes) at an open circuit range from 5 × 10−2 to 1 × 100 s, dependent on the light intensity. This result is in good agreement with the lifetimes for dye-sensitized p-NiO solar cells.9
 Fig. 3  Time constants for recombination (τr) and transport (τc) as functions of Jsc for CdS sensitized NiO solar cells containing an electrolyte of 0.5 M Na2S, 0.1 M S8, and 0.2 M KCl in 7:3 H2O:methanol (v/v) and with a platinized conducting glass counter electrode. 
As a result of the difference between the transport and recombination lifetimes, the charge collection efficiency ηcc (ηcc = 1 − (τt/τr))24 of the CdS-sensitized NiO solar cell compares favorably with ηcc of the dye-sensitized NiO counterpart. From Fig. 3, it should be noted that the τt/τr ratio increases with increasing light intensity. At the highest light intensity, the τt/τr ratio is smaller than 10−2, suggesting that ηcc is larger than 99%. Considering the difference in the internal quasi-Fermi levels between a short circuit (for measuring τc) and an open circuit (for measuring τr), the actual ηcc at a short circuit is essentially 100%. As a reference point, the ηcc of dye-sensitized p-NiO cells has been reported to range from 52–97%, dependent on the light intensity.25 The relatively low ηcc of the dye-sensitized NiO photocathodes could be due to the slow hole transport owing to the presence of traps/defects on the NiO nanoparticle surface. It is reasonable to assume that, unlike molecular dyes, the conformal CdS layer covering the NiO surface would passivate many of the surface traps/defects, resulting in faster hole transport through the NiO network. Even though the charge-collection efficiency is high, and a reasonable IPCE is observed, the performance of the CdS–NiO PEC cell under AM 1.5 simulated solar light (Fig. S4, ESI†) is only fair. This is likely due to a relatively inefficient charge-separation process arising from recombination of photogenerated electrons in CdS with holes in CdS or in NiO. The non-optimized light absorption property of CdS coated on the NiO nanoparticles (Fig. S3, ESI†) is also a likely factor affecting the J–V properties. Also, the potential electron transfer from CdS to the substrate could lead to the reverse flow of the photocurrent.12 However, the degree of the impact of such effect on the photocathode characteristics is expected to depend on the specific structural and electrochemical properties of the electrode film architecture.
In summary, the surface of a p-NiO nanoparticle film was conformally coated with a thin layer of CdS using chemical bath deposition. The conformal layer served several functions to varying degrees: it sensitized the NiO to visible light, transported the photogenerated holes away from the hole injection site, and passivated NiO surface states. Compared to dye-sensitized NiO photocathodes, the CdS–NiO PEC cell displayed two orders of magnitude faster hole transport and high charge-collection efficiency of near unity. However, the solar power conversion efficiency was relatively low due to nonoptimized light harvesting and/or inefficient charge separation.
