Open-circuit voltage (Voc) was linearly increased with increasing the thickness of the surface ZrO2 film from 863 mV for the bare TiO2 to 988 mV for the surface modified TiO2 with 2.2 nm-thick ZrO2 layer (Voc was 1030 mV for the mesoporous ZrO2), which was due to decrease in electron injection by thickening the surface ZrO2 layer. Change in electron injection was confirmed by photoluminescence spectra. Charge collection was diminished with the surface ZrO2 layer, which might be related to the limited electron diffusion length in the solution-processed perovskite layer due to the reduced injection into TiO2. Fill factor was reproducibly improved by surface modification, which is due to increased shunt resistance. By the controlled electron injection method, a power conversion efficiency was improved from 11.7% to 13.6% by introducing 1.1 nm-thick ZrO2 layer on the TiO2 surface.
1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cells have been proved to be a promising next-generation photovoltaic technology since the report on long-term durable perovskite solar cells in 2012.1 Organometal halide perovskite materials with chemical formula of CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Br or I) were first attempted as sensitizer in dye-sensitized solar cell structure in 2009,2 which showed power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3–4%. The low PCE in the sensitized structure was improved to 6.5% in 2011 by optimizing coating condition.3 Thanks to the pioneer works on perovskite solar cell, especially on the solid-state perovskite solar cells based on mesoporous TiO2 (ref. 1) and Al2O3 (ref. 4) together with the confirmed long-term stability,1,4 researches on perovskite solar cell has been intensively performed. Consequently, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 18–20% were recently certified.5,6 CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) material possess intriguing opto-electronic properties such as high absorption coefficient,2,7–9 low reflectivity,9–11 small exciton binding energy,12 photo-induced giant dielectric constant,13 long charge diffusion length ranging from 1 μm for the solution-processed perovskite films14,15 upto 10 μm for the millimeter scale single crystal,16 and high charge carrier mobility.17 Due to the balanced charge transport behavior and small exciton binding energy, MAPbI3 can be applied to various types including mesoscopic structure and p–i–n or p–n junction planar structure.18–21
Electron injection from MAPbI3 to TiO2 is obvious for the sensitization structure, where the MAPbI3 nanodots were deposited locally on TiO2 surface and the mesopores in the TiO2 film were filled with hole transporting spiro-MeOTAD.1 However, working mechanism may be different in case of the mesoscopic structure in which pores of the TiO2 film is filled with MAPbI3. Although charge separation was observed at both TiO2 and spiro-MeOTAD junctions in the mesoscopic structure by transient laser spectroscopy and microwave photoconductivity measurements,22 it was argued that the dominant transport pathway would be the perovskite absorber even in the mesoscopic structure.23 This indicates that electron injection is debatable in the mesoscopic structure with mesoporous TiO2 film impregnated with MAPbI3. We are thus motivated to study on the degree of electron injection in the mesoscopic structure by depositing the electron non-accepting ZrO2 layer24 on TiO2 surface and controlling the thickness of ZrO2 layer.
Here, we report on effect of the ZrO2 layer deposited on TiO2 surface on photovoltaic performance of the mesoscopic structured perovskite solar cell. In order to investigate electron injection behavior, the thickness of the ZrO2 thin layer was varied from about 5 Å to 22 Å by changing the concentration of zirconium butoxide coating solution. Photovoltaic parameters were substantially changed with increasing the ZrO2 layer thickness, where photovoltage increased with ZrO2 layer thickness and eventually approached to that for the pure ZrO2 mesoporous film. Our experimental observation proves that electron injection occurs at least in the interfacial MAPbI3 being in contact with TiO2 surface.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of mesoporous TiO2 films
Anatase TiO2 nanoparticles (average diameter of about 50 nm) were hydrothermally synthesized by two step method.25 The paste was prepared by mixing the TiO2 nanoparticles with terpineol (Aldrich, 99.5%), ethyl cellulose (Aldrich, 46 cp) and lauric acid (Fluka, 96%). The nominal composition of TiO2:terpineol:ethylcellulose:lauric acid was about 1.25:6:0.9:0.1. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (Pilkington, TEC-8, 8 Ω sq−1) was cleaned by UV/ozone treatment and sonication with ethanol. FTO surface was covered with a thin compact TiO2 layer prior to deposition of the mesoporous TiO2 film by spin-coating the 0.15 M titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75 wt%, Aldrich) solution in 1-butanol at stepwise spin rate of 700 rpm for 8 s, 1000 rpm for 10 s, and 2000 rpm for 40 s, which was followed by drying at 125 °C for 5 min and then finally annealed at 500 °C for 15 min. The nanocrystalline TiO2 paste was deposited on the compact TiO2 layer using spin-coating technique at the rate of 2000 rpm for 20 s and subsequently annealed at 550 °C for 1 h in a muffle furnace to obtain mesoporous TiO2 film. Thickness of the annealed mesoporous TiO2 layer was measured to be 300 ± 20 nm by an alpha-step IQ surface profiler (KAL Tencor). The annealed TiO2 film was immersed in the 20 mM TiCl4 (Aldrich) aqueous solution at 70 °C for 10 min. The substrates are washed with distilled water and dried under air flow, which was followed by annealing at 500 °C for 30 min.
2.2 Formation of ZrO2 thin layers on TiO2 surface
A 2-propanol solutions of 0.01 M, 0.02 M, and 0.04 M zirconium(IV) butoxide (Sigma-Aldrich, 80 wt% in 1-butanol) were prepared in argon atmosphere to be used as the precursor solution. 20 μL of the precursor solution was spin-coated on the annealed mesoporous TiO2 film at spin rate of 4000 rpm for 20 s. The film was then dried under N2 flow. After drying at room temperature, the film was annealed at 500 °C for 20 min in air. The thickness was controlled by varying precursor concentration and the number of spin coating/annealing cycles.
2.3 Preparation of mesoporous ZrO2 film
ZrO2 nanoparticles were prepared according to the method reported elsewhere.26 Zirconium(IV) propoxide solution (51.43 mL, 70% in propanol) was mixed with acetic acid (13.5 mL) under argon condition, to which H2O (214.29 mL) was added under vigorous stirring at room temperature. Colorless precipitate was formed. After stirring for about 1 hour, the propanol was removed by evaporation using a rotatory evaporator at 80 °C for 30 min, to which HNO3 (8.57 mL, assay 68–70%) was added and then the solution was aged for about 12 h under stirring at room temperature. A homogeneous and transparent yellowish liquid was observed. The solution was diluted with 19.24 mL of H2O, which was transferred to a Teflon liner autoclave and heated at 230 °C for 12 h. The resultant was washed with EtOH several times. The prepared ZrO2 nanoparticles were mixed with terpineol, ethyl cellulose and lauric acid to make a viscous paste with nominal composition of ZrO2:terpineol:ethyl cellulose:lauric acid = 1:6:0.3:0.1. Mesoporous ZrO2 film was prepared on the compact TiO2 layer by spin coating technique, where 2.5 g of the ZrO2 paste was diluted with 10 mL of EtOH. 0.5 mL of the diluted solution was spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 20 s, which was heated at 550 °C for 1 h. The annealed ZrO2 film was not post-treated with TiCl4. The thickness of ZrO2 film was adjusted to about 300 nm.
2.4 Fabrication of perovskite solar cells
MAPbI3 was deposited by two-step costing method.25 The 20 μL of 1 M solution of PbI2 in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, >99% Sigma) was first spin-coated on the mesoporous TiO2 films with and without surface modification and the ZrO2 film at 3000 rpm for 5 s and 6000 rpm for 5 s. The film was dried consecutively at 40 °C for 3 min and 100 °C for 5 min. In the second step, a 200 μL CH3NH3I solution (7 mg of CH3NH3I in 1 mL 2-propanol) was spin-coated onto the dried PbI2 film at 4000 rpm for 30 s and then dried at 100 °C for 5 min to form MAPbI3, where a loading time of 20 s was required prior to spinning. Spiro-MeOTAD hole transporting layer (HTL) was formed on the perovskite capping layer by spin-coating 20 μL of spiro-MeOTAD solution at 4000 rpm for 30 s. The composition of the spiro-MeOTAD solution was composed of 0.06 M spiro-MeOTAD (72.3 mg of spiro-MeOTAD in 1 mL of chlorobenzene), 0.198 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) and 64 mM Li-TFSI (520 mg Li-TFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%)). Au electrode was finally formed on the HTL by thermal evaporation of gold under 1.0 × 10−5 Torr at 0.7–1.0 Å s−1. The thickness of the deposited Au layer was measured to be about 100 nm.
2.5 Characterizations
Photocurrent (J) and voltage (V) were measured using a solar simulator (Oriel Sol3A class AAA) equipped with 450 W xenon lamp (Newport 6279NS) and a Keithley 2400 source meter. The NREL-calibrated Si solar cell with KG-2 filter was used to adjust light intensity to one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2). While measuring photocurrent and voltage, the cell was covered with a metal aperture mask with area of 0.123 cm2. Incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured at DC mode using the IPCE system (PV measurement Inc.). A 75 W xenon lamp (USHIO, Japan) was used as a white light source to generate a monochromatic beam. Calibration was conducted using NIST-calibrated photodiode G425 as a standard. The thin layers of ZrO2 deposited on TiO2 surfaces were investigated using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F) at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were collected using a Cary Eclipse Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies) with a xenon flash lamp and a photomultiplier tube (PMT) detector. All samples were photoexcited at 530 nm.
3. Results and discussion
Fig. 1 shows HR-TEM images of TiO2 nanoparticles with and without surface modification with thin ZrO2 layers along with that of ZrO2 nanoparticles. Compared to bare TiO2 in Fig. 1(a), deposition of zirconium butoxide solution forms thin layer of ZrO2 on the TiO2 surface. Presence of ZrO2 layer is also confirmed by elemental analysis based on energy dispersive X-ray, which is consistent with previous result.27 Thickness of the surface formed ZrO2 layer increases with increasing the precursor concentration or number of coatings, where ZrO2 layers with average thickness of about 0.5 nm, 1.1 nm, 1.7 nm and 2.2 nm can be coated on the TiO2 surface. Except for the ZrO2 layers formed from single coating of 0.01 M and 0.02 M, conformal coating of ZrO2 layer on TiO2 surface is formed by dual coating. Compared to ∼50 nm in diameter for the TiO2 particle, ZrO2 nanoparticle shows smaller size of around 20 nm in diameter.

Fig. 2(a) and (b) shows SEM images of bare nanocrystalline TiO2 and ZrO2 coated TiO2. In Fig. 2(b), TiO2 nanoparticles coated with ZrO2 shows no significant difference in surface roughness, which indicates that conformal ZrO2 layer might be formed on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles. Energy dispersive X-ray mapping is further studied to investigate elemental distribution for the ca. 1 nm-thick ZrO2 layer deposited on the TiO2 nanoparticle (Fig. 2(c)). In elemental distribution images, zirconium (Zr) is detected on the edge of the particle, while titanium (Ti) and oxygen (O) are distributed over the whole part of the particle, which confirms that conformal ZrO2 layer is formed on the surface of the TiO2 nanoparticle.

Photovoltaic performance is found to be significantly altered by the surface modification as can be seen in Fig. 3. Short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) decreases but open-circuit voltage (Voc) increases predominantly with increasing the thickness of the surface coated ZrO2 layer. Change in Jsc is well consistent with change in IPCE, where IPCE at long wavelength decreases for the 0.5 nm- and 1.1 nm-thick ZrO2 layers. However, decrease in Jsc is observed in the entire wavelength when the ZrO2 layer thickness increases to 1.7 nm and 2.2 nm. Average photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. Voc increases substantially from 0.863 V for bare TiO2 to 0.988 V for 2.2 nm-thick ZrO2 layer on TiO2. In addition, surface modification improves fill factor (FF) by 9.1–11.8%. Increase in both Voc and FF compensate the decreased Jsc, which consequently leads to improvement of PCE. Average PCE is enhanced from 11.7% for the bare TiO2 to 13.6% for the 1.1 nm-thick ZrO2 layer on TiO2, corresponding to 16.2% increment.

In Fig. 4, Jscs calculated based on the IPCE data are compared with Jscs obtained from I–V curves. The calculated Jsc from the IPCE data has about 90% of the Jsc obtained from the I–V measurement, which indicates that the calculated Jsc is well matched with the observed Jsc with small deviation.

We plot the photovoltaic parameters as a function of ZrO2 layer thickness in Fig. 5. Jsc is almost invariant with ZrO2 thickness upto ∼1 nm but starts to decrease upon increasing the ZrO2 layer thickness. On the other hand, Voc decreases continuously with ZrO2 thickness. For the case of the mesoporous ZrO2 film, injection from MAPbI3 to ZrO2 will be inhibited because of higher conduction band position and insulating property of ZrO2.28 Thus, free electrons are transported in the perovskite and collected to the photoanode. The highest Voc observed for the mesoporous ZrO2 film is related to Fermi energy level of MAPbI3.28 The large difference in Voc between bare TiO2 film (0.863 V) and bare ZrO2 film (1.03 V) is indicative of evidence of electron injection from MAPbI3 to TiO2. The increasing rate of Voc looks to be extrapolated to Voc for the mesoporous ZrO2 film, which indicates that the amount of electron injection into TiO2 is diminished by increasing the surface ZrO2 layer thickness. The controlled electron injection by the surface ZrO2 layer is also confirmed by PL measurement.

Fig. 6 compares PL intensity depending on the surface ZrO2 layer thickness. All the PL peaks are located at around 780 nm, which is well consistent of emission peak of MAPbI3.29 The bare TiO2 film shows lowest PL intensity, while PL intensity increases with increasing surface ZrO2 layer thickness and eventually highest PL intensity is observed from the bare ZrO2 film. When comparing PL intensities of the surface modified TiO2 with those of both bare TiO2 and ZrO2, increase in PL intensity with increasing the surface ZrO2 layer thickness is clearly indicative of reduction of electron injection by the surface coated ZrO2. The tendency of PL intensity correlates with change of Voc with the surface ZrO2 layer.

Fig. 7 shows dark J–V curve of devices incorporating bare TiO2 and TiO2 coated with ca. 1.1 nm-thick ZrO2 layer. Shunt and series resistance are obtained from the inverse slope at zero bias and Voc region, respectively.30 Series resistance is increased by 26% (from 6.25 to 7.91 Ω cm−2) with ZrO2 layer, while shunt resistance is increased by 65% (from 23364.49 to 38654.81 Ω cm−2). Therefore, the improved FF is mainly due to the increased shunt resistance. Ideality factor (n) and saturation current (J0) were calculated by fitting the data using following eqn (1), 
(1)where JD, Vb, q, kB, and T represent current density, bias voltage, electron charge, Boltzmann constant, and temperature, respectively. Ideality factor is calculated to be 2.09 for bare TiO2 and 2.32 for ZrO2 coated sample. J0 is estimated to be lowered by ZrO2 coating (2.09 × 10−7 mA cm−2) compared to bare sample (3.03 × 10−7 mA cm−2), which correlates with higher Voc by ZrO2 coating.31

I–V hysteresis is investigated since planar structure without mesoporous TiO2 film or mesosuperstructured perovskite with scaffold oxide layer such as Al2O3 shows more pronounced I–V hysteresis than the mesoscopic structure with mesoporous TiO2 film.32,33 Fig. 8 compares I–V hysteresis, where the I–V hysteresis of the bare TiO2 is much less than that of the bare ZrO2. Since ZrO2 is non-injection oxide, the structure containing the mesoporous ZrO2 film is similar to those with Al2O3 or without mesoporous oxide layer in terms of electron injection. Thus I–V hysteresis of the mesoporous ZrO2 is expected to be severe, which is well consistent with the previous reports showing severs I–V hysteresis of planar structure or Al2O3 bearing perovskite.32,33 Such I–V hysteresis is thus related to non-injection property in the mesoscopic structure. Compared to I–V hysteresis of the bare TiO2 film, more developed I–V hysteresis of the surface modified TiO2 with ZrO2 is due to the reduced electron injection into TiO2 by the surface ZrO2 layer. Extent of I–V hysteresis provides indirect evidence of interfacial electron injection at TiO2–perovskite junction.

Photo-stability of the device with and without ca. 1.1 nm-thick ZrO2 layer is evaluated (Fig. 9). The measurement was conducted under one sun illumination without encapsulation. Both of the devices show severe degradation of PCE during the light soaking in which 90% of initial performance is degraded within an hour. The degradation of PCE looks faster with ZrO2 coating. The poor stability of device with ZrO2 coating is probably related to characteristics of the device similar to planar junction device without mesoporous TiO2 layer (hysteresis, electron transport pathway).34 Our result suggests that stability of perovskite solar cell might be closely related to electron transport pathway.

4. Conclusion
We investigated interfacial electron injection by means of surface modification of the mesoporous TiO2 film in the mesoscopic perovskite solar cell structure. Voc was found to depend predominantly on thickness of ZrO2 layer. For the non-injection system employing mesoporous ZrO2 film, highest Voc was demonstrated. When assuming that no interfacial injection occurs, Voc is expected to be independent on surface modification. Thus, our experiments evidences obviously that electron injection occurs at TiO2–perovskite interface. By controlling electron injection and thereby optimizing photovoltaic parameters under the given experimental condition, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) was improved by 16.2%, compared to the bare (untreated) TiO2 device.
