    , Accepted 19th September 2018First published on 25th September 2018AbstractPerovskite solar cells are promising highly efficient and low-cost photovoltaic devices. Nevertheless, the use of the toxic element Pb is still a big challenge for the mass production of highly efficient perovskite solar cells. In this work, a novel and facile technique is presented to fabricate tin-lead alloyed perovskite films using metal precursors and a substitution method. Herein, the perovskite films are formed as a result of the substitution reaction between the Sn metal precursor and methylammonium triiodideplumbate (CH3NH3PbI3, MAPbI3) solution carried out at 70 °C. The maximum Sn content in perovskite films reaches up to 15% with a substitution reaction time period of 1 day. Through this substitution technique and the unique growth mechanism, a less-toxic and efficient perovskite solar cell with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.46% is fabricated. It is found that this substituting strategy can exploit a new direction to further explore different active metals substituting less active organic metallic systems with even lower temperature conditions.
Introduction
Low toxic organometal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted increasing interest and extensive research due to the possibility of providing environmentally friendly and sustainable energy by harvesting solar light. The power conversion efficiency of metal-halide perovskite solar cells has skyrocketed from 3.8% to an incredibly high value of 23.3% within just about 9 years.1,2 Metal-halide perovskite is an outstanding photoabsorber and carrier transporter, owing to its high extinction coefficient, excellent ambipolar charge mobility, low exciton binding energy and tunable bandgap.3–8 Perovskite solar cells can be easily and cost-efficiently prepared via solution processing methods coupled with high-yield printing and coating technologies, which is attractive for practical and scalable solar energy harvesting in industrial applications. However, the challenges for large-scale deployment of perovskite solar cells are the stability and toxicity issues. As packaging technology is maturing at an exceptional rate, research on environmental impact becomes increasingly urgent.3 Lead, a major component of all high-performance perovskite cells, could be very toxic and harmful to the environment and life. Lead is also considered as a carcinogen that is moderately water-soluble and banned in many countries. The severe toxicity issue arising from Pb during device fabrication, deployment and disposal is the biggest concern.9 Therefore, lead-free perovskites or low-toxic metal-Pb alloyed perovskites are necessary for the replacement of lead perovskites in PSCs.10 Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite compounds based on metal halides adopt the ABX3 perovskite structure. This structure consists of a network of corner-sharing BX6 octahedra, where the B atom is a metal cation (typically Pb2+) and X is a halide anion (typically I−); the A cation is selected to balance the total charge, and it can be a Cs+ or a small molecular species (typically CH3NH3+).5,11 The replacement of Pb2+ by other nontoxic metals is required to resolve the toxicity issue and Fe, Co,12 Bi,13,14 Sb,15–19 and Sn20–37 are good candidates as the substitution metals on the Pb site of MAPbX3. The benefits of this strategy include a reduced amount of lead content and broadening of the light absorption towards higher wavelengths. Correa-Baena et al. reported the complete optical properties of CH3NH3SnxPb1−xI3 films and the PCE of a SnPb alloyed perovskite solar cell with 15% Sn content is measured to be 6.1%.29 Hao et al. developed CH3NH3Sn0.15Pb0.85I3-based PSCs with a maximum PCE of 7.39% and an average PCE of 6.51%.20 Hu et al. obtained a maximum PCE of 12.81% with a 15% Sn content perovskite.38Via tuning the X site with varied content of Br,39–41 Zuo et al. reported that the 15% Sn content perovskite could achieve the highest efficiency of 9.77%.24 The power conversion efficiency (PCE)42 could be enhanced by tuning the A site with an appropriate amount of FA+ and Cs+,43–46 whereas, few research studies have been focused on the fabrication method of Sn–Pb alloyed perovskite.22,26,47 Until now, the most widely used fabrication method for Sn–Pb perovskite solar cells has been by adding SnI2 and PbI2 precursors with a certain ratio, while heat treatment is found to be a critical factor that might cause the full degradation of the pristine perovskite films into SnI2 and a certain admixture of SnI4.32,33,48 This synthesis method for Sn–Pb alloyed perovskites is very challenging due to easy oxidization of tin halide (typically SnCl2 or SnI2) and rapid crystallization of the SnPb perovskite layer. The Sn–Pb rapid crystallization would lead to low crystallinity and leaving the reaction orientation in an uncontrollable manner.20,26 Substitution reactions have been widely used to perform and analyze the mechanism in inorganic chemical reactions.49,50 The substitution reactions are the reactions which depend on the activity of metals, where the more active element substitutes the less active one in the chemical compound. The activity of metals can be determined by using the chemical activity series. Despite the fact that the substitution reactions are common in inorganic synthesis, few literature studies have reported that this kind of reaction occurred with the organometal halide perovskite.
In this work, a novel and facile technique fabrication of SnPb alloyed perovskite was successfully introduced by a metallic tin substitution reaction with conventional organic lead perovskite. This strategy involves precise molecular engineering for perovskite the structure as well as a quantitatively partial substitution of Pb2+ by Sn within the lattice. The obtained high-quality planar heterojunction Sn content of 15% with a p-i-n device structure has an encouraging optimum PCE of 12.46%. This active metal substituting technique explores a new fabrication strategy for multi-organometal perovskite solar cells.
Experimental section
Materials
PbI2 (99.99%) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Alfa Aesar, respectively. CH3NH3I (>99.0%) was purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass with a sheet resistance of 14 Ω per square was purchased from Pilkington Glass (England). Tin powder (99.8%, 325 mesh) was purchased from J&K Scientific Ltd. The purity of silver wire is 99.99%. All other materials were purchased from J&K Scientific Ltd. All the used reagents were of analytical grade.
Perovskite solar cell fabrication
The devices were fabricated in the configuration of FTO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskites/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/fullerene surfactant (Bis-C60)/Ag. Firstly, laser-patterned FTO-coated glass substrates were cleaned by ultrasonication in an alkaline, aqueous washing solution and rinsed with deionized water, ethanol, acetone and 2-propanol, respectively. After that, a PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P VP AI 4083) film was formed by spin-coating on the substrates, and then the substrates were annealed at 150 °C for 10 min. PbI2 and CH3NH3I (molar ratio = 1:1) were dissolved in γ-butyrolactone (99%) and dimethyl sulfoxide (volume ratio = 7:3) at a low stirring speed of 200 rpm at 70 °C. After 2 hours of continuous stirring, a homogeneous CH3NH3PbI3 solution at a concentration of 462 mg ml−1 (∼1 M) was obtained. After that, 0.5 g of tin powder was added into 4 mL CH3NH3PbI3 solution and was kept stirring at 70 °C during the whole procedure. One-sixth of the mixed solution was removed after 0 d, 0.5 d, 1 d, 2 d, 4 d, and 7 d, followed by a filtration process using a nylon filter membrane with a pore diameter of 0.22 μm. The perovskite film was spin-coated by two steps: the first layer is spin-coated at 1500 rpm for 15 s, and the second is at 4000 rpm for 45 s, followed by rinsing with acetone for 25 s and drying at 100 °C for 20 min. The final CH3NH3SnxPb(1−x)I3 perovskite films with substitution times of 0.5 day, 1 day, 2 days, 4 days and 7 days were denoted by MASnxPb(1−x)I3-0.5 d/1 d/2 d/4 d/7 d (0 < x < 1), respectively, and the CH3NH3SnxPb(1−x)I3-0 h could also be denoted as MAPbI3. After that, the [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) (15 mg L−1 in chloroform) and Bis-C60 surfactant (2 mg mL−1 in isopropyl alcohol) were spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 60 s, sequentially. Finally, 150 nm Ag was thermally evaporated onto the HTM layer in a vacuum to act as the cathode. The cell area is measured to be 0.09 cm2.
Characterization
Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra were recorded with a Hitachi U-4100 (300–600 nm: xenon lamp, 300 W; 600–900 nm: tungsten–halogen lamp, 150 W). XRD patterns were obtained using a D8 Advance (Germany) diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (40 kV and 40 mA) with a scan rate of 4° min−1 for a wide angle test increment over the Bragg angle range of 10–80°. SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) analysis was performed on a Hitachi-S-4800 electron microscope. The compositions of the low-temperature prepared SnO2 nanocrystalline films were characterized by using a XPS system (Thermo Scientific, Escalab 250Xi). The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured using an FS5 fluorescence spectrometer of Edinburgh Instruments company. The time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy (TRPL) spectra were recorded with Fls-800 spectrometers. Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mappings were performed using an X-Max50 of Oxford Instruments. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cells were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under illumination of simulated sunlight (AM1.5, 100 mW cm2) provided by a solar simulator (Newport 69907) with an AM 1.5 filter. Light intensity was adjusted with an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell with a KG-2 filter for approximating 1 sun light intensity. While measuring current and voltage, the cell was covered with a black mask with an aperture (aperture area is close to the active device area). The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was measured in DC mode with a 1/4 m double monochromator (Crowntech DK242), a multi-meter (Keithley 2000), and two light sources depending on the wavelength range required (300–600 nm xenon lamp, 300 W; 600–900 nm: tungsten–halogen lamp, 150 W). The monochromatic light intensity for IPCE was calibrated with a silicon photodiode reference. All the measurements of the solar cells were performed under the ambient atmosphere at room temperature without encapsulation.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows a schematic illustration of the substitution reaction for Sn metal substituting Pb ions in perovskites. The substitution reaction is Sn (s) + Pb2+(aq) → Sn2+(aq) + Pb (s), given that the electrode potential of E(Sn2+/Sn0) = −0.140 V and E(Pb2+/Pb0) = −0.126 V. The content of Sn in MASnxPb(1−x)I3 perovskite could be well controlled via varying the substitution reaction time period. Fig. 1a and b show the Sn metal stirred and reacted with homogeneous MAPbI3. Sn replaced the Pb2+ ion and occupied its position within the [PbI6]4− octahedron. Upon reaching the final equilibrium, a homogeneous MASnxPb1−xI3 solution was formed with specific Sn/Pb stoichiometry as illustrated in Fig. 1c, which is the basis for designing and developing the Sn–Pb alloyed perovskite solar cells with FTO/PEDOT:PSS/MASnxPb1−xI3/PCBM/C60/Ag structure, shown in Fig. 1d.

The morphology of perovskite films with different Sn substitution periods is shown in the top-view SEM images in Fig. 2. Through increasing the reaction time of Sn metal in pristine perovskite solution, these Sn–Pb alloyed films show uniform grains without obvious pinholes or cracks, which is crucial for reducing short-circuiting and charge leakage issues. Fig. S1† shows the representative SEM image and the corresponding EDS element mappings of Sn, Pb, I, C, and N in the MASnxPb1−xI3-1 d film. The EDS mapping of each element confirmed that the MASnxPb1−xI3 film was substituted successfully, forming a homogeneous phase distribution. Fig. S2† shows the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the completely assembled photovoltaic device, in which the perovskite absorber has an approximate thickness of 200 nm. The functionalities of each layer have been discussed in the literature.24,51

The chemical composition and crystal structure of MASnxPb1−xI3 varies with the substitution reaction time from 0 day to 7 days and were analyzed by X-ray diffraction. The XRD spectrum is shown in Fig. 3a. In addition, as shown in Fig. S3,† these Sn–Pb alloyed perovskite materials do not contain any residual reagent, such as Sn metal, CH3NH3I, and PbI2. Two characteristic peaks observed for all MASnxPb1−xI3 derivatives are at positions where 2θ = 14.4° and 28.7°, enlarged in Fig. 3b and c. These two characteristic peaks are indexed to be the (110) and (220) crystal planes in the tetragonal phase.45 According to the XRD patterns, Pb–Sn binary metal based perovskites grew highly preferentially along the <110> direction. The lattice d-spacing values of the (110) peak for MASnxPb1−xI3 films with different Sn metal substitution reaction times (0 d, 0.5 d, 1 d, 2 d, 4 d, and 7 d) are calculated from the obtained XRD patterns, which are 0.6271 nm ± 0.0001 nm, 0.6146 nm ± 0.0004 nm, 0.6135 nm ± 0.0005 nm, 0.6154 nm ± 0.0006 nm, 0.6163 nm ± 0.0003 nm, and 0.6265 nm ± 0.0005 nm, respectively. The corresponding d(220) are also calculated to be 0.3133 ± 0.0003 nm, 0.3112 ± 0.0002 nm, 0.3101 ± 0.0001 nm, 0.3104 ± 0.0004 nm, 0.3110 ± 0.0001 nm, and 0.3132 ± 0.0002 nm, respectively (see Table 1). It is notable that the d(110) and d(220) both show an decreased trend at first and then increase as the substitution reaction time prolongs. The d-spacing values reach the maximum after 1 day, indicating that MASnxPb1−xI3-1 d films have the smallest crystal unit cell volume. This means more Sn ions are included in the lattice. By further prolonging the substitution reaction to 2 d, 4 d, and 7 days, the Sn2+ fall off from the perovskite structure and the corresponding d-spacing values become larger as shown in Fig. 3b and c and Table 1, which is in good agreement with the XPS spectra shown in Fig. 4 and Table 2. Such evolution suggests a distortion of the relative positions within the octahedra. It turns out that replacement of Pb with Sn induced crystal unit cell volume decrease, which is consistent with the fact that Sn has smaller ionic radii compared with that of Pb, according to previous reports22,27 (atomic radii of Sn and Pb are 1.72 Å and 1.81 Å, respectively).

The quantitative results of perovskite on FTO glass are also obtained from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as illustrated in Fig. 4, S4† and Table 2. MASnxPb1−xI3 has peaks assigned to Sn3d, Pb4f, and I3d. The atomic ratio of Sn:Pb:I within different MASnxPb1−xI3 derivatives were characterized to be MASn0.05Pb0.95I3, MASn0.15Pb0.85I3, MASn0.1Pb0.9I3, MASn0.1Pb0.9I3 and MASn0.02Pb0.98I3, respectively, when the Sn substitution time was varied from 0.5 d to 7 d. In the literature, Sn4+ and Sn2+ have been reported to give signals at 486.5 eV and 486.25 eV, respectively.28,47,52 The XPS spectrum of MASnxPb1−xI3-1 d shown in Fig. 4b exhibits the strongest intensity for the Sn2+ peaks, indicating that a maximum amount of Sn0 was oxidized to Sn2+ during the substitution reaction after 1 day. The formation mechanism of Sn2+ involved in the octahedron [SnI6]4− of MASnxPb1−xI3 is shown in chemical reaction 1, whereas, by further prolonging the substitution time, the ratio of Sn2+ in the SnPb alloyed perovskite exhibits a decreased trend. The Sn4+ signal does not appear in Fig. 4b. This is because the Sn4+ is easily reduced to Sn2+ by excessively added Sn metal powders. The dotted line located at 137 eV is ascribed to metallic lead (Pb0). The peaks assigned to Pb4f shift to lower binding energy values after Sn substitution in 1 day, 2 days, 4 days and 7 days, shown in Fig. 4c. This suggests that a few substituted Pb0 residuals remained in the perovskite film in the form of Pb nanocrystals. This also implies that the coordination environments of Pb and I were altered when Sn2+ was present within the octahedron unit.23,53,54 This observation reveals that the amount of metallic lead in the perovskite film significantly restrains the photovoltaic exciton generation and transport. While controlling the Sn reduction time in MAPbI3, the amount of metallic Pb in the MASnxPb1−xI3 film can be reduced. xSn + MAPbI3 = MASnxPb1−xI3 + xPb(1)

Fig. 5a shows the absorption spectra of alloyed Sn–Pb perovskite deposited on glass substrates. The pure Pb perovskite shows the absorption spectral onset at approximately 790 nm. On increasing the Sn proportion within the MASnxPb1−xI3 perovskite, the absorption shifted toward to a longer wavelength region, around 825 nm until x = 0.15. Fig. 5b compares the band gaps (Eg) of MASnxPb1−xI3 perovskites at variable substitution reaction times. The anomalous band gap behavior has been reported by Hao et al.22 The energy plots in Fig. 5b show that MASnxPb1−xI3 perovskites have a lower bandgap of 1.50–1.52 eV compared with that of MAPbI3 of 1.56 eV. The substitution reaction time and the amount of Sn content within the perovskite play a vital role in modifying the crystal structures and thus decrease the band gaps for these MASnxPb1−xI3 perovskite derivatives.

We verified effective photovoltaic exciton quenching of MASnxPb1−xI3 by measuring the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra. The MASnxPb1−xI3 perovskite layer with a substitution time of 1 day exhibits a higher quenching rate than that of 0.5 d, 2 d and 4 d. The peak of the PL intensity of MASnxPb1−xI3-1 d is about 825 nm in accordance with its UV-vis spectrum. Due to the higher PL quenching efficiency of pure lead perovskite, the champion PCE of 19.43% is obtained for pure Pb perovskite, which is higher than that of the low-toxic Sn–Pb alloyed perovskite, shown in Fig. 5d, S5† and Table 3. This suggests sacrificing the efficiency achieves a low-Pb and environmentally friendly PSC, which is in consensus with the literature.45,55 The relationship between the Sn/Pb ratio and photovoltaic performance is summarized in Fig. 5d, S6† and Table 3. The maximum photovoltaic performance was observed when the Sn metal substitution reaction continued for 1 day (x = 0.15, MASn0.15Pb0.85I3). Open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), short circuit current (Jsc), and efficiency of the MASnxPb1−xI3-1 d perovskite solar cell were measured to be 1018 mV, 58.69%, 20.85 mA cm−2, and 12.46%. The PCE for Sn substitution for 1 day is higher than those of 0.5 day (11.63%), 2 days (11.08%) and 4 days (9.093%). When the ratio of Sn decreased further below 0.15, the photovoltaic performance decreased again. The edge of the electronic absorption spectra is reported to have a shift towards longer wavelengths with the addition of Sn to the Pb perovskite.56 The edge of the incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) curves for MASnxPb1−xI3 shift from 790 nm to 850 nm as the Sn substitution reaction time increased, shown in Fig. 5e. The band gap of the perovskite can be tuned between 1.50 eV and 1.56 eV via changing the amount of Sn content. It is worth mentioning that the MASnxPb1−xI3 solar cell had a red-shift in comparison to the MAPbI3, which is in an agreement with the PL and UV-vis characterization. Meanwhile, the integrated Jsc values estimated from IPCE were in good agreement with the measured Jsc, shown in Fig. 5e.

Time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements (Fig. 5f) exhibit a trend in accordance with that of the lattice d-spacing value of the XRD peak and Sn proportion. TRPL was employed to analyze the recombination dynamics within the perovskite solar cells.57–59 Compared to MASnxPb1−xI3-0.5 d and MASnxPb1−xI3-4 d, which have longer exciton carrier lifetimes of 4.65 μs and 3.55 μs, MASnxPb1−xI3-1 d exhibits a lower lifetime of τave = 2.78 μs and the hole carriers accelerate at 67.3% and 27.5% of the extraction speed from the PEDOTS:PSS/perovskite interface. The increase in charge-carrier extraction time results from the interfacial defects and the metallic Pb nanocrystals. This indicates that a low defect concentration provides superior electronic quality for the MASnxPb1−xI3-1 d perovskite film, leading to a high Voc in photoelectronic conversion.60,61 The series resistance in Fig. 5d increases if the Sn substitution period is too long (for example, 4 days), which is mainly ascribed to the reduction of FF in accordance with the literature.62 Considering the recombination loss and interfacial resistance/series resistance, the TRPL nonradiative recombination (short lifetime) ratio of 1 day to 4 days as shown in Fig. 5f decreases from 67.69% to 49.32%, implying that the interfacial resistance gets increased. Prolonging the substitution time from 1 day to 4 days, the radiative recombination (long lifetime) ratio increases from 32.31% to 50.68%, suggesting an increased recombination loss and severe charge carrier accumulation that causes the formation of space charge regions somewhere in the device (Table 4).63

Conclusion
In conclusion, we introduce a novel and facile method for preparing low toxic Sn–Pb alloyed perovskite films using metal precursors and a substitution technique. The formation of perovskite films results from the substitution reaction between the Sn metal precursor and methylammonium triiodideplumbate (CH3NH3PbI3) solution carried out at low temperature. The SnPb alloyed perovskite with a Sn substitution time of 1 day exhibits the optimum Sn substitution content, denoted as MASn0.15Pb0.85I3, with a maximum PCE of 12.46%. The increasing content of Sn in the perovskite film improves the photovoltaic exciton generation and transport. Future investigation on increasing the Sn content in SnPb based perovskites would be a combination of centrifugation, perovskite recrystallization and iterative substitution. This reactive metal substitution strategy will enable further improvements in the photovoltaic performance of less-toxic organometal perovskite solar cells.
