One such research concept “liquid chemistry” has recently been introduced as a third-generation of liquid materials after the first and second generations of solvent liquids and ionic liquids, respectively. The outstanding features of novel organic molecular liquid matter are solvent-free neat phase at room-temperature, nonvolatile, tunable optic and/or electronic functions, processability, etc. The availability of a paintable/printable liquid phase which can accommodate various dopants to generate functional composites is the main attraction of these molecular liquids. As promising candidates, emitting and semiconducting liquid materials have already been practically demonstrated and which may replace inorganic or self-assembled organic semiconductors in performance and processability. Compared to ionic liquid materials obtained by lowering the glass transition temperature through ionic interactions, covalently functionalised organic liquid matter is conceptually unique and exhibits several advantages. In this feature article, the recent developments in the emerging research field of functional molecular liquid materials are discussed.Sukumaran Santhosh BabuSukumaran Santhosh Babu received his PhD in 2009 from National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology (NIIST), Trivandrum, India, under the guidance of Dr. A.

1. Introduction
Recent developments of molecular materials towards organic electronics have been significantly supported by the advantages of synthetic organic and polymer chemistries, photophysics and printable processing technologies.1–5 As a result, meaningful and challenging concepts have been promptly accepted and became a part of successful demonstrations. However, semiconducting materials currently used in organic molecule- or polymer-based flexible electronic devices have many shortcomings including limited life time, insufficient performance and improvable processability.5–7 In order to have an increased capability, utmost care from synthesis to end-use applications is needed for organic substances. This situation demands alternative materials to develop energy saving and low cost devices in the near future.
In the concept of flexible devices including developing foldable materials,5,6 softening of the optoelectronic functional materials is an essential methodology.8 Initially, as a trial, nonvolatile, room-temperature solvent-free molecular liquids were formulated, subsequently used in various devices and applications, and finally emerged in successful demonstration.9 These liquid materials exhibit several unique advantages as low viscosity soft substances, such as nonvolatility, solvent-free processing, tunable optic and/or electronic properties, a monomeric and intrinsic property in the condensed bulk liquid state and acting as solvent to dissolve many other organic or inorganic dopants. Hence in the past few years various solvent-free organic and inorganic liquid materials have been reported. Organic molecular liquids are broadly classified into two categories: covalent and non-covalent liquid systems. Covalent molecular liquids are obtained by direct chemical modification of π-conjugated core units using low viscosity, bulky and flexible side chains. In the latter case, noncovalent interactions, especially ionic interaction is used to lower the melting temperature, which is basically the same as for ionic liquids. Therefore covalently modified functional organic liquid substances can be regarded as organic molecular liquids.
Advantageously, organic molecular liquids are tractable and hence can be easily handled in the bulk scale. Presently, the solvent-free formulation of organic molecular materials that contain chromophoric and/or other functional moieties is an emerging area. However, except a few demonstrations, excellent end-use performance and exciting applications, have yet to be established. Here, we highlight the recent developments in various solvent-free functional molecular liquids.
2. Organic liquids
The last decades have witnessed the realisation of various successful demonstrations in the area of low energy electronic devices by taking advantage of self-assembled functional organic materials. However, the difficulty in achieving high device (or energy conversion) efficiency and processability has been a motivation for material chemists to develop room-temperature liquid materials. One of the scientific discussions is centred on how to develop a new phase (state) of known amorphous, crystalline or self-assembled solid materials. The most important strategy to approach this point is a regulation of inter- and/or intra-molecular interactions at room-temperature. The attachment of low viscosity, flexible side chains onto a functional core unit leads to the production of a new generation of nonvolatile molecular liquid materials. The liquid materials of carbon nanomaterials and organic chromophores have been recently investigated for their fluid and optoelectronic features. The softness of alkyl, oligo or poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), and siloxane side chains have played a major role in lowering the melting point of these molecules. Apart from the low viscosity, the chemical structure (linear or branched), chain length and substitution pattern of the side chains also contribute to control the physical liquid properties.
2.1 Nanocarbon liquids
As the first example of nanocarbon liquids, our group established the synthesis of photoconductive fullerene (C60) liquids via a covalent approach.10a–c The N-methylfulleropyrrolidines formed via a substituted alkyloxyphenyl group equipped with linear (1b–1f) and branched (2–4) alkyl chains (Fig. 1) exhibited room-temperature fluid property due to effective preventing of C60 aggregation. In the case of shorter chain lengths, high melting points are observed due to the π–π interaction between adjacent C60 moieties. At longer chain lengths van der Waals interactions between adjacent alkyl chains is dominating and results in an increase in melting point.10a At medium chain lengths, a competition between these two different intermolecular forces leads to a decrease in melting points and thereby a liquid feature is observed. For C60 derivatives, upon increasing the alkyl chain length from octyl (1a), dodecyl (1b) to hexadecyl (1c) the melting point exhibited a decrease from 147–148 °C, to 13.7 °C and to −36.5 °C, respectively (Fig. 2a).10a,b A further increase in the alkyl chain length resulted in an increase of the melting points; the melting points of octadecyl (1d), eicosyl (1e) and docosanyl (1f) were found to be −7.9, 4.5 and 21.5 °C, respectively (Fig. 2a).10a,b It should be noted that 1e exhibits a relatively high photoconductivity, ∼0.03 cm2 V−1 s−1 confirmed by the time of flight (TOF) technique.10a This result indicates that aggregation of C60 core moieties was partially disturbed but there are still significant C60–C60 interactions to lead to organic semiconducting material behaviour. These results are understandable if we consider the molecules have similar molecular structures of asymmetric surfactant-like amphiphiles, which can maintain a tendency to form aggregates. Therefore the liquid fullerenes can be categorised as amorphous, semiconducting organic molecular liquids but containing small clusters inside. The intrinsic properties of pristine C60 were retained in the solvent-free liquid form as indicated by reversible multiple-electron reduction.

As another report, the self-assembly and optoelectronic properties of alkylated N-methylfulleropyrrolidines could be regulated by chain branching.10c The decreased crystallisation tendency and enhanced solubility provided by branched alkyl chains enables material softness and thereby lowering the melting point and viscosity. The substitution of swallow-tail type branched alkyl chains such as 2-decyltetradecyloxy chain at (3,5) (2) and 2-octyldodecyloxy chain at (2,5) (3) positions of the phenyl group produced solvent-free, nonvolatile, fluid state C60 materials at room-temperature. Moreover the substitution of a hyperbranched aliphatic chain at (2,4,6) positions of the phenyl group resulted in a fluid C60 4. Compounds 2 and 3 exhibited no clear glassy transition (Tg) up to −120 °C whereas 4 has a Tg at around 12 °C. The complex viscosity (η*) of the liquids follows the trend, 4 (∼128000 Pa s) > 2 (∼1500 Pa s) > 3 (∼260 Pa s). This could be attributed to the fact that liquids equipped with hyperbranched chains experience high intra- and intermolecular friction upon flowing.
A comparison of the structural requirements of C60 and C70 liquids enabled a better understanding of the molecular design.10b The alkyl chain length of the substituents significantly affected the physical properties of the fullerene C60 and C70 derivatives. Even though C70 derivatives 5a–c exhibited phase behaviours similar to those of C60 derivatives, the Prato-type10d modification of the C70 core with of 1,3,5-tris(alkyloxy)benzene led to isomeric mixtures of monoadducts due to the prolate spheroidal π-chromophore. When the alkyl chain length attached to the C70 unit was increased from octadecyl (5a) to docosanyl (5c), the melting (glassy transition) point gradually increased from −10.5 to 20.6 °C (Fig. 2b). The reason for angular frequency (ω) dependency of both series of C60 and C70 derivatives could be attributed to the presence of various components having a long relaxation time and the formation of large clusters with complicated movements.
Apart from the design and synthesis of liquid fullerenes, optoelectronic properties of the nanocomposite liquid material comprised of cadmium selenide (CdSe) nanocrystals (NCs) and photoconductive liquid C60 (1e) was investigated.10e The low viscosity of 1e enabled to disperse CdSe NCs well in the liquid C60 matrix. The inherent electron accepting feature of 1e was evidenced in the rapid quenching of steady-state photoluminescence of CdSe NCs. This points to the clustering of 1e and CdSe NCs via favourable van der Waals interaction between the hexadecylamine ligands of CdSe NCs and alkyl chains of 1e. A donor–acceptor liquid composite composed of CdSe NC/1e exhibited an excellent photoelectrochemical performance when a cast film on FTO-coated glass electrode was analysed (Fig. 3a). In comparison to a film of pure CdSe NCs, the composite film containing 25 wt% CdSe NCs in 1e exhibited a 200% photocurrent enhancement under white-light illumination (1000 W m−2) (Fig. 3b) and 300% increase in cathodic photocurrent under blue-light illumination (480 nm light, 25 W m−2).

Instead of making liquid fullerenes by covalent attachment of motifs, functional fullerene liquids were achieved by ionic interactions. Giannelis and co-workers have extended the synthetic strategy of nanoparticle ionic materials (NIMs, vide infra)11a to achieve hydroxylated fullerene (fullerol) fluid containing 20 wt% fullerol.11b This has been obtained by neutralising the fully protonated fullerol with an amine terminated polyethylene–polypropylene oxide oligomer, M2070. The ionic bond interaction significantly controls the thermal transitions and melting/crystallisation of M2070.
Another attractive nanocarbon fluid material is based on carbon nanotubes (CNTs).12 The carboxylic and hydroxyl groups on oxidized CNTs react via nucleophilic attack with the chain terminated oxirane ring of the silicone leading to a permanent, covalent attachment.12a The silicone-functionalised hairy CNTs were found to be in a homogeneous and viscous tar-like liquid state containing 85% w/w of CNTs. CNTs wrapped with ionic soft chains also resulted in homogeneous, one-phase fluids via ionic interactions.12b–d A black, waxy solid CNT was isolated when oxidised CNTs were reacted with a PEO substituted tertiary amine.12b By attaching octadecyl amine groups of PEG, multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs) melted at room-temperature to yield a homogeneous viscous fluid having 40 wt% of MWCNTs.12c Polysiloxane quaternary ammonium salt, [(CH3O)3Si(CH2)3N+(CH3)2(C18H37)Cl−] (DC5700) upon bonding with the OH or COOH group on ultralong MWCNTs, followed by cation–anion exchange reaction with sulfonate salts yielded MWCNT based fluid material.12d The solvent-free hybrid nonionic nanofluids of MWCNTs decorated with silica nanoparticles were fabricated by using oxidised MWCNTs and pluronic copolymer, poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(propylene oxide)-block-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO-b-PPO-b-PEO).12e
The above stated ionic interaction has been extended to prepare graphene-based fluid materials.13 Self-unfolded graphene sheets were prepared by the ionic interaction between exfoliated graphene decorated with aryl diazonium salts and quaternary ammonium salts of oligomeric nonylphenyl PEO.13a The electrostatic interaction between sulfonated graphene surface with terminal ammine groups of [H3C(OCH2CH2)31(OCH2CH-CH3)10NH2], Jeffamine 2070 chains yielded a graphene fluid.13b The enhanced conducting feature and larger specific surface area provided by the unfolded graphene structure may enable improved performance of fluid graphene materials in nanocomposites, secondary batteries and supercapacitors.
2.2 Emissive molecular liquids
Emissive materials have attained much attention recently due to their substantial use in low-cost, low-energy light emitting devices.14a Especially, luminescent organic materials are particularly important because of the high demand for the development of solution processable large-area devices. But in most of the cases, improved colour stability and purity is unattainable to a large extent as solvent-free conditions often leads to molecular assemblies and random aggregates. In addition, in the case of crystalline and solid samples, processing of low cost, large area smooth thin films is a tedious task. In this context, solvent-free luminescent materials that can be paintable on various surfaces are very appealing.
Branched alkyl chains have been extensively used to control intermolecular forces and thereby to fine tune solubility as well as materials softness in organic substances.14b The concept of developing low viscosity of functional materials with the aid of branched alkyl chain substitution has remained relatively unexplored.14b Recently, we have reported room-temperature solvent-free fluid property of emissive oligo(p-phenylenevinylenes) (OPV) (6, 7) (Fig. 4a) equipped with branched long alkyl chains.9c Here we established a new strategy to develop room-temperature liquid materials, instead of asymmetric head-to-tail type molecular design applied fullerene liquids (vide supra).10a The wrapping of a π-conjugated core by branched alkyl chains is sufficient to disturb π–π (core–core) interactions and thereby leads to room-temperature nonvolatile fluids. By changing from methyl or linear alkyl chains to branched ones, keeping the same OPV core, instead of self-organised solids, leads to room-temperature nonvolatile liquids. The viscosity and other physical parameters of these liquids are sensitive to the extent of chain branching and substitution pattern. The (2,4,6)-substitution on end phenyl rings on both sides of OPV molecules and swallow-tail type alkyl chains are efficient in wrapping the OPV core and reducing intermolecular interactions when compared to (3,5)-substitution pattern and hyperbranched chains. The low viscosity, 34.6 Pa s for 6a and 0.64 Pa s in 7b at the angular frequency (ω) of 10 rad s−1, and relatively low Tg between −44 to −55 °C were found to be the outcome of efficient core isolation by the branched alkyl chains.

The effective core isolation enabled to obtain similar photophysical features in the bulk solvent-free liquid as well as in the homogeneous monomeric solution conditions. The UV-visible absorption and fluorescence spectral features of the liquid OPVs showed quite high similarity in both conditions. The yellowish liquid OPVs exhibit blue colour emission (Fig. 4b) upon excitation at the absorption maximum. The unique feature of these liquid materials is the high luminescence quantum yield, i.e. 48% in 7b, retained in the solvent-free state, indicating the absence of strong self-quenching due to intermolecular interaction. Apart from this, other advantages are, the luminescent liquids are nonvolatile functional materials, easy handling under solvent-free condition, and availability of solvent-like matrix for other small molecular dopants. Upon doping with green emitting tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminium (Alq3), blue emission of the liquid OPV (6b or 7b) was shifted to greenish blue colour emission, and further blending with orange emitting rubrene enabled to prepare white emitting solvent-free liquids by simply mixing with a spatula (Fig. 5a). The spectral width ranging from 400 to 700 nm was found to be matching well with the required standard spectral feature of white emission (Fig. 5b). Blending of emissive dopants with a liquid OPV, for 1 min, resulted in composites with fairly good white emission having Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) 1931 chromaticity diagram coordinate value of (0.33, 0.34) (λex = 360 nm). The liquid composites exhibited a Tg around −45 °C with comparatively lower viscosity of 3.2 Pa s and this opened the door towards some practical demonstration of white emitting liquid materials. The white emitting solvent-free formulation can be applied on various large area surfaces (Fig. 5c), even on proto-type UV-LED (Fig. 5d) and as a solvent-free luminescent ink.

We further considered to develop full-colour luminescence liquid materials by applying the core-isolation strategy.9c By attaching branched, low viscosity aliphatic chains to the anthracene core, nonvolatile, blue-emitting room-temperature liquid anthracenes have been obtained very recently.9d In order to discover suitable candidates for flexible and foldable electronic applications, anthracene-based liquid materials having enhanced photostability, fluorescence quantum yield up to ∼55%, colour tunability and processability were developed. The new design strategy enabled to overcome major limitations of anthracene-based functional materials such as sensitivity to air and light, obstacles in preparing homogeneous thin films from crystalline assemblies and limited luminescence colour tunability.
The yellowish transparent viscous fluids 8 and 9 (Fig. 6a and b) are equipped with swallow-tail type alkyl chains on a dendritic skeleton and hyperbranched aliphatic chains without the dendritic skeleton, respectively. The π–π interactions of the adjacent anthracene units are substantially diminished, leading to an isotropic liquid phase. Hence the XRD analysis exhibited only two halos corresponding to an average distance between the molten alkyl chains and the disordered anthracene core–core distance. The reduced intermolecular π–π interactions via soft and bulky alkyl chains attachment led to a low η* of 0.28 (8) and 84.0 Pa s (9) at ω = 10 rad s−1. In the cooling trace of the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermogram, 8 exhibits a Tg of −59.6 °C, which is increased to −32.4 °C for 9. An improved photostability in the solvent-free state, revealed 8 as optically active for up to 4 h under 365 nm filtered Xe light irradiation and 15 h in dilute dichloromethane solution. In comparison with the model derivative diphenylanthracene (DPA) the photostability was remarkably enhanced about 5 to 10 times both in solvent-free and solution conditions (Fig. 6c).

The low viscosity (>0.28 Pa s) and high absolute fluorescence quantum yield (∼55%) of the blue emitting anthracene liquids (Fig. 6b) led to control the emission features by simply mixing with emissive solid dopants, namely 9,10-bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene (dopant-1, D1) and tris(1,3-diphenyl-1,3-propanedionato)(1,10-phenanthroline)europium(III) (dopant-2, D2). An efficient energy transfer assisted fluorescence colour tuning was observed by increasing the mol% of D1. In accordance with this, the blue emission colour from 8 changed to cyan (0.3 mol%), green (0.5 mol%), greenish yellow (2 mol%) and finally to yellow (5 mol%) (Fig. 7a). Similarly, upon addition of D2, the blue fluorescence of 8 was changed to violet at 2 mol% and purple at 5 mol%. A thermoresponsive composite with red emission was developed by mixing a combination of 0.5 mol% D1 and 5 mol% D2 into a liquid matrix of 8. On increasing the temperature, the red emission colour was changed to yellow (50 °C) and with a further increase in temperature to emerald green (100 °C) (Fig. 7b). This facile procedure for various luminescence colours (Fig. 7c) provides technological potential for the use as a continuous active emitting layer in flexible/foldable devices.

Solvent-free luminescent fluid materials can be applicable to organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs).15 Adachi and co-workers proposed that in OLEDs if the fluid organic semiconductors can be circulated or refilled, fresh semiconductor materials will be always utilised and which will minimise device degradation.15a A combination of liquid 9-(2-ethylhexyl)carbazole 10a (Fig. 8a)15b,c host and a guest dopant rubrene resulted in electroluminescence from rubrene with highest external quantum efficiency (ηext) of 0.03% and luminance of 0.35 cd m−2 at a current density of 0.26 mA cm−2. In another report, an OLED composed of 10a, 6-{5-[3-methyl-4-(methyloctylamino)phenyl]thiophen-2-yl}-naphthalene-2-carboxylic acid hexyl ester as a emitting layer and TiO2 as a hole-blocking layer was prepared.15d An external electroluminescence quantum efficiency (ΦEL) of 0.31 ± 0.07% and a maximum luminance of 100 cd m−2 were obtained. The use of a liquid carbazole substituted with a PEO chain 10b (Fig. 8a) provided a substantial improvement in carrier injection, and resulted in ΦEL of 0.75%.15e

(b) The conceptual illustration and (c) the device structure of an OLED based on liquid pyrene 11b with a mesh-structured cathode and a back side reservoir made by microelectromechanical system processing. The illustrations (b and c) were redrawn from ref. 15f. 
A refreshable OLED with a liquid-like pyrene 11b (Fig. 8a) as an emitting layer was also reported.15f A specially designed LED equipped with a mesh-structured cathode and a liquid reservoir in the back side of the cathode was used for measurement (Fig. 8b and c). The decomposition of the liquid-like emitter 11b under the drive current led to a decrease in the device luminescence. However, a quick emission recovery was observed due to the replacement of decomposed molecules with fresh emitters through the mesh cathode. A refreshable LED with a liquid emitter material may find applications in uniform and degradation-free lighting devices or image sticking-free information displays. The device lifetimes of liquid OLEDs mainly depends on the electrochemical stability of radical cations in the liquid emitting layer and which can be improved by an appropriate combination of guest (11a) and host (12) molecules (Fig. 8a).15g The enhanced electrochemical stability of 12 and slower decomposition of 11a enabled to enhance the device lifetime. These newly introduced fluid substances (10–12) are categorised as amorphous liquids, similar to the fullerene one,10a which could contain small clusters of π-conjugated core units.
In addition, liquid organic dye lasers based on 10a doped with green- and red-emitting dyes have been developed by Ribierre and co-workers.16a A cascade Förster-type energy transfer from 10a to doped dyes has been employed to achieve colour-variable amplified spontaneous emission and lasing. Apart from these neutral molecular liquids, emissive ionic liquids such as benzobis(imidazolium) salts,16b naphthalenesulfonamides,16c 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonate containing trihexyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium cations,16d and stilbenes with imidazolium cations16e have also been investigated for their luminescence properties.
2.3 Semiconducting liquids
Molecular liquids have also been investigated for their semiconducting properties. As the first report of a hole transporting liquid, Bender et al. synthesised triarylamine 13 (Fig. 9a) by one-step Ullman condensation of a substituted aniline with an excess of substituted aryl iodide.17a Later, various liquid triarylamine derivatives bearing silyl ether groups were synthesised.17b–e The ability of electron donating triisopropylsilyl ether groups to prevent crystallisation and effectively lower the glass transition temperature has been utilised to synthesise liquid triarylamines 14a and 14b (Fig. 9a).17b The incorporation of siloxane chains as well as asymmetric substituents via Piers–Rubinsztajn condition effectively lower the Tg, resulting in triarylamine-based room-temperature liquid materials (15a–c, Fig. 9a).17c,d This strategy has been extended to synthesise triarylamines with a phenylene diamine core (16, Fig. 10), and with a benzidine core (17a–e, 18, Fig. 10).17d The hole transport behaviour of the silyl ether substituted liquid triarylamine 14a exhibited charge transport property similar to that of conventional disordered solids.17e The TOF mobility measurements over a wide range of temperature (−40 to 60 °C) indicated the negligible effect of molecular motion on macroscopic charge transport (Fig. 9b).

Grätzel and co-workers have used amorphous liquid-like tris[4-(2-methoxyethoxy)phenyl]amine 19 (Fig. 11a) as a hole-transporting material in nanostructured dye-sensitised solar cells.17f The enhanced conductivity of chemically (NOBF4) doped 19 was used as an electron donating/hole-transporting component. Power conversion efficiency up to 2.4% and incident photon-to-electron quantum efficiency of 50% was obtained from the liquid dye-sensitised solar cell (Fig. 11b). The liquid carbazole 10a17g showed a hole mobility of 4 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 at an applied electric field of 2.5 × 105 V cm−1, in a TOF experiment using a phthalocyanine charge generation layer.17h The enhanced charge carrier mobility of liquid carbazole could be attributed to both a larger transfer integral and changes in the distribution of the excimer trapping sites. It should be noted again that the liquid fullerene 1e exhibited a much higher photoconductivity, ∼0.03 cm2 V−1 s−1. The high charge carrier mobility of 1e and the blue photoluminescence of 10a make them attractive candidates for semiconducting device applications which need fluid working conditions.

2.4 Other organic liquids
Maya et al. have reported a series of isotropic viscous green phthalocyanine (Pc) liquids 20a–d (Fig. 12a) containing peripherally substituted polysiloxane chains.18a,b This unique combination imparts thermorefractive features of the polysiloxane chains and nonlinear optical properties of the Pc core. The Tg of Pc liquids is controlled by the siloxane chain length and it varied between −122 and 16 °C. In addition to large nonlinear absorption and refraction coefficients, silicone based liquid phthalocyanines exhibit optical transparency, photo-oxidative stability and processability.

The research groups of Gryko18c and Maruyama18d independently reported the synthesis of meso-substituted 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(3,4,5-trialkoxyphenyl)porphyrins 21a–e (Fig. 12b). The liquid feature was observed for porphyrin derivatives with alkyl chain length from decyl to tetradecyl and the decomposition temperature of these liquids were found to be above 230 °C. Interestingly, the spectroscopic features of these liquid are identical to their solid analogues. The liquid-like behaviour was confirmed by the higher loss modulus (G″) than storage modulus (G′) over the measured ω range and strain amplitude (γ) of 10, 100 and 1000%. The liquid porphyrin 21c acted as a medium for the dispersion for C60 and/or CNTs through intermolecular donor–acceptor and/or π–π interactions.18d It has been found that sugar alcohol scaffolds with multi azo-arms 22a–d (Fig. 13a) exhibited a solid to liquid transition under UV-light irradiation (λmax = 365 nm) at room-temperature (Fig. 13b–e).18e The yellow solid 22b gradually changed to orange upon irradiation and after 1 h, the solid pieces eventually became fluidic droplets due to the trans to cis isomerisation of the azobenzene arms. The liquefaction property has been used as a promising application of a photochemically reusable adhesive. The adhesive strength value of thermally solidified 22b, ca. 50 N cm−2, showed a significant decrease to less than 0.3 N cm−2 after photoliquefaction.

3. Liquid proteins
Another innovative liquid material is the solvent-free liquid phase of globular proteins.9a This new bio-nanomaterial phase challenges the established models of the role of water molecules in protein folding and function, and thereby paves new research directions. A transparent, viscous, red coloured liquid protein is prepared by using ionic interaction between cationised iron-storage protein ferritin and negatively charged polymer surfactant with a stoichiometry of 1:264.19a The structurally intact protein nanostructure in the liquid state was confirmed by the presence of electron-dense nanoparticles (∼8 nm) in transmission electron microscopy. The liquid protein composite exhibited a transformation from a Newtonian-like liquid to a viscoelastic liquid leading to thermotropic liquid-crystalline phase with distinct Maltese cross texture at 32 °C. As another example, a heme protein myoglobin liquid was reported by the same group (Fig. 14).19b The attractive feature of the liquid protein is the ability to reversibly bind gaseous ligands such as dioxygen, carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide molecules at the heme metallocentre, similar to that under physiological conditions. The dynamic hyperthermophilic liquid construct retains the ability to reversibly re-fold in the solvent-free state.19c Temperature-dependent synchrotron radiation circular dichroism spectra indicated the equilibrium denaturation of the liquid protein under extreme thermal conditions in the absence of water.

4. Supramolecular polymer liquids
In order to overcome the reduced stability of the host–guest complexes in solution, biocompatible, recyclable and thermally stable cyclic pillar[5]arene 23 (Fig. 15a) and 24 (Fig. 15b) based liquid hosts were reported by Ogoshi and co-workers.20a The cyclic hosts exhibited liquid features even at −50 °C and were stable up to 250 °C, indicating the possible enhanced host–guest complexation over a wide range of temperature in the solvent-free condition. Interestingly, liquid [2]rotaxanes consist of solid axle molecules covered with the liquid host synthesised using 23 with more than 95% conversion in the solvent-free state. In contrast, the low association constant in the presence of CDCl3 (K = 16.9 ± 1.0 M−1), resulted in a low conversion of 8%. An ionic-liquid based macrocyclic pillar[5]arene host 24 (Fig. 14b) with high thermal stability, moderate ionic conductivity and solvent-free complexation ability was also reported from the same group.20b The 1:1 complexation of 24 and guest tetracyanoethylene with an association constant of K = 62 ± 10 M−1 gave a clear deep green colour. In addition, several supramolecular polymer liquids by making use of the complimentary hydrogen bonding interaction between motifs such as thymine and diamidopyridine,20c thymine and diaminotriazine,20d and quadruple H-bonding between ureidopyrimidinones20e have also been reported.20f

5. Inorganic nanoparticle liquids
In addition to functional organic substances, inorganic nanomaterials such as metal nanoparticles (NPs), quantum dots (QDs) and metal oxides can also be made to flow like liquids at room-temperature by attaching appropriate ligands to the respective cores.21–23 The group of Giannelis have significantly contributed in the area of organic–inorganic hybrid fluid materials called nanoscale ionic materials (NIMs).11a,21 The first-generation NIMs were based on surface modification of nanomaterials with a quaternary ammonium silane followed by an ion-exchange with a relatively bulky anion whereas second-generation NIMs were obtained with reversed charges on the nanomaterial cores and counter ions. Nanofluids of sepiolite (magnesium silicate) containing anionic nonylphenoxy poly(ethyleneoxy) ethanol sodium sulfate on cationic sepiolite-silica core,22a SiO2 NPs,22b etc. have also been reported. The covalent attachment of alkyloxy monolayers on to the surface of silicon nanocrystals resulted in blue22c and white22d light emitting solvent-free liquids with high thermal stability. Fluid silica NPs have also been synthesised by functionalising the NPs with a neutral, hydrophilic polyethylene glycol tailed silane.22e The synthetic methodologies in NIMs have been extended to synthesise metal oxide based nonvolatile liquids.23
NP liquids of metals such as platinum, gold, palladium and rhodium were also synthesised.24a The Au NP liquid has been used in a radio-frequency microelectromechanical system24b and to fabricate high-resolution nanopatterns by thermal imprinting.24c The ligand-exchange assisted phase transfer was found to be an efficient method for the preparation of solvent-free NP liquids of various inorganic nanoparticles such as Ag, Au, Pt, Pd and CdSe@ZnS QDs.24d Lead salt (PbS, PbSe and PbTe) QD ionic liquids were obtained by capping QDs with polymer ligands.25a The ionic bonds between carboxylate groups grafted on the surface of CdSe/CdS/ZnS core/shell/shell QD core and cationic surfactant with polyethylene glycol chains resulted in solvent-free QD liquids.25b Multi-emission was observed with CdTe nanofluids based on hydrogen bonded assembly.25c
6. Conclusions and perspectives
The recent development in connection with the relatively new topic of functional solvent-free liquids is covered in this Feature Article. As a new physical liquid state, these materials find fundamental importance and raise many intriguing questions to the scientific world. The significantly different and improved properties of molecular liquids and corresponding nanofluids obtained by dispersing them in ionic liquids are the motivation for the recent development of this area. The recent scientific developments point to the synthetic manipulation of currently used nanomaterials leading to various functional hybrid nano-objects which may find application in flexible and further foldable electronic devices. In such a way the limitations associated with solid-state nanoscale objects can be significantly reduced. From the initial developments, the area of functional nanofluids has flourished in all directions of material chemistry. For instance, the major contribution from organic molecular liquids is valuable, as covalently functionalised organic liquids exhibit versatile semiconducting and luminescent properties. A simple doping method has been effectively used to develop paintable inks with tunable luminescence colour.9c,d Another important feature of the available solvent/matrix to dissolve dopants has led to an efficient way to prepare photoconductive solvent-free composites.10e Moreover, solventless liquid proteins,19 supramolecular liquids,20 fluids of inorganic nanoparticles21–24 and quantum dots25 have also paved new research directions in material chemistry. However, this area has still to grow to deliver meaningful applications with excellent efficiency. More focus will be needed to find implementation of these functional liquids in flexible/foldable electronic devices leading to energy saving and low-cost technologies for greater sustainability.

His research interests are self-assembly and photophysical properties of π-conjugated molecules, applications of functional assemblies and carbon nanomaterials, functional organic molecular liquids, etc.
Takashi Nakanishi	Takashi Nakanishi completed his doctoral course in shorter period at Nagasaki University, Japan, in 2000. After JSPS post doctoral researches at Houston University, USA, and at Oxford University, UK, he joined the National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS), Japan, in 2004. Since 2010, he has been a principal researcher at NIMS. In 2007–2010, he has also been a group leader at the Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces, Germany, and in 2007–2011, he was a researcher of PRESTO, Japan Science and Technology Agency. Since 2011 he was also a visiting Professor at Warsaw University of Technology, Poland. His research interest is the development of self-assembly controlled multifunctional soft materials including dimension and morphology regulated molecular architectures as well as optically and electronically active nonvolatile room-temperature liquids.
