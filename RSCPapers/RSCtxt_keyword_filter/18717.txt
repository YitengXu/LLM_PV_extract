    , Accepted 26th November 2022First published on 9th December 2022AbstractSeven novel organic compounds BHJ-i (i = 1–7) based on carrying 8-alkyl-8H-thieno [2,3-b] indole as a donor, thiophene as a bridge and different acceptors were used for bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ). The main objective of this work was to find a better acceptor for π-conjugated molecules used in photovoltaic solar cells in order to improve their efficiency. The study was through DFT and TD-DFT quantum methods. Several optoelectronic properties of these materials, electronic properties (EHOMO, ELUMO, and Egap), natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis, quantum chemical parameters (chemical hardness (η), chemical potential (μ) and electronegativity (χ)), UV-vis spectra and the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), were calculated. We also developed the 3D-QSPR model based on CoMFA and CoMSIA approaches to predict the most important three-dimensional properties of the structure of 8-butyl-8H-thieno [2,3-b] indol-2-yl) thiophen-2-yl) methylene derivatives, which allowed us to design new molecules and optimize their properties for a high-performance Voc. The results indicated that the molecules in this work exhibit a theoretical power conversion efficiency of 7%. Finally, due to 3D-QSPR results, we have designed 10 new molecules, which have very interesting Voc values.
1. Introduction
Organic materials have attracted the attention of researchers and industrialists since 1990.1,2 Until now, these materials have shown relatively low power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Furthermore, the best yields have been obtained for volume heterojunction structures based on a donor material (organic material) and an acceptor material (PC61BM)3–5 mixed together achieving the highest PCEs of 10%.6,7 With the aim of improving the performance of the bulk heterojunction solar cells (BHJ), methods that can be used include reducing the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the organic material and decreasing its bandgap, which increases the voltage in open circuit (Voc) and PCE.8–11 Generally, the most used organic molecules of the BHJ type have a typical donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) structure.12 Also, the choice of the donor (organic matter) is a very important factor influencing the performance of photovoltaic devices, and popular donors include carbazole,13 triphenylamine,14–19 thieno[3,2-b][1] benzothiophene,20 indoline,21–27 and thieno [2,3-b] indole. As is known, thieno[2,3-b]indole compounds, which constitute an isoelectronic structure of carbazole, are rarely used in organic electronics. Although some of their derivatives have been patented recently for OLED applications28 and others have shown their efficacy in medicinal chemistry29 and agrochemistry30 due to their biological activity. At the same time, thieno[2,3-b]indole derivatives were synthesized and tested as dyes in DSSCs and BHJ.31–33 Recently, A. N. Bakiev and al.34 have synthesized and studied three new dyes based on thieno[2,3-b] indole as a donor, thiophene as the bridge, and three different acceptors for use as a donor in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Motivated by the previous results, we took compound BHJ-R as the reference molecule because of its good results (λmax = 369 nm, Eoptgag = 1.69 eV) and we replaced its acceptors with seven other acceptors in order to provide promising candidates for the improvement of photovoltaic properties and performance to be used as donor fragments for BHJ systems. In this study, the electronic structure and optical properties of eight compounds (Fig. 1) were calculated using the DFT and TD-DFT methods. In contrast, we used the 3D-QSPR model to predict the most important three-dimensional properties of studied molecules, which allowed us to design new molecules and optimize their properties for a high-performance Voc.

2. Computational details
2.1. DFT and TD-DFT calculations
The density functional theory (DFT) was used with the hybrid functional B3LYP35–37 and the set of basis 6-31G(d,p) to determine the optimized geometry of the ground state of the gas phase compounds. All frequency calculations were performed with the objective to ensure that the optimized geometries obtained for these molecules corresponded to a minimum. The electronic populations of HOMO, LUMO, and gap energy frontier orbitals were deduced in order to analyse their distribution along these molecular orbitals. All the calculations were performed using the Gaussian software 0938 supported by the Gauss View 5.1.8 interface.39 While the natural bond analyses (NBO)40 were calculated using the NBO 3.1 program integrated into the Gaussian software package 09. On the other hand, the absorption spectra were simulated based on the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) using the CAM-B3LYP41,42 functional with solvation (chloroform), taking into account the effect of the solvent using the polarizable continuum model with the integral equation formalism (IEF-PCM).43 These calculations were performed from geometries optimized in the ground state.
2.2. 3D-QSPR modeling
3D-QSPR models were developed to describe the structural properties of the eight BHJ molecules bearing thieno[2,3-b]indol fragments favorable to enhance the Voc property of optimized BHJ molecules. Also, 3D-QSPR models were used in this study to design and suggest new BHJ molecules as well as predict their Voc properties using field properties calculated in the 3D space. Using the Sketch option of SYBYL-X2.1 software, we sketched out the structures of the eight molecules to be examined.44 Then, we optimize the BHJ compounds by using a standard Tripos Powell force field (200 run, distance-dependent dielectric function, root mean square of 0.05 kcal mol−1) and calculated the Gasteiger-Huckel partial atomic charges of the designed BHJ compounds.45 Due to the importance of molecular alignment in the generation of 3D-QSPR models, all eight BHJ compounds were aligned with the template compound BHJ-3 (highest power Voc). Upon aligning the molecular structures, the steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic, donor, and acceptor hydrogen bonds of the BHJ molecules were computed. This was achieved using CoMFA (comparative molecular field analysis) and CoMSIA (comparative molecular similarity indices analysis) approaches.46 These analyses were adjusted in the Tripos force field by placing the spatial reference grid at 2 Å in all Cartesian directions, an sp3 hybridized carbon atom with a net charge of +1 source to calculate the steric and electrostatic potentials, fixing the correction factor of the default Gaussian function gradient at 0.3, and fixing the default cutoff energy at 30 kcal mol−1.47 After calculating the field molecular contours of the designed BHJ molecules, we performed the PLS (partial least squares) regression analysis on the generated database. This was to identify the linear quantitative relationship between the field descriptors of (CoMFA, CoMSIA) and Voc property. The optimal 3D-QSPR models were screened to describe the structure–property relationship of BHJ compounds bearing the thieno[2,3-b]indol radical based on the statistical significance criteria and QSPR model validation indices described by Golbraikh and Tropsha.48,49 Among the important indices of statistical significance evaluated in this work include the coefficient of determination (R2), standard error of estimation (SEE), the coefficient of determination via leave-one-out cross-validation (Q2loocv), Fisher test (F), and Y-Randomization test. The effect contributions of the calculated molecular descriptors to Voc were mapped onto the molecular structures investigated by the generation of contour field maps (Fig. 2).

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Ground state geometries
The optimized geometries of all the BHJ-R and BHJ-i molecules (i = 1–7) obtained using the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) method are shown in Fig. 3. The calculated dihedral angles Φ (°) and bond distances d (Å) of the studied compounds are listed in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, the obtained bond lengths (d) for all the molecules ranged from 1.41 to 1.44 Å, these values are almost similar to each other, which shows that there is a good transfer of the intramolecular charge.50 On the other hand, for the dihedral angles, we found that the value of Φ1 (the donor group and π-spacer) varies between 170.69° and 179.26°, which shows that the studied compounds have a non-coplanar structure, this is probably due to the steric effect of the donor group. Finally, we found that the value of the dihedral angle Φ2 for all the molecules is almost stable, which means that the different acceptors are perfectly coplanar.

3.2. Electronic properties
As we know, the theoretical calculation of the energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is crucial in studying BHJ to determine whether the transfer of charges between the donor and the acceptor is effective.51,52 In this work, we calculated it for all the studied molecules, from the most stable conformation of each, the values of the energies HOMO (eV), LUMO (eV), and the energy gap (eV) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. The results obtained are therefore grouped in Table 2. The energy levels of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals of all the studied organic materials are presented in Fig. 4.

 Fig. 4  HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the studied molecules and PC61BM at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. 
From Table 2, we can observe that the energy gap in eV decreases according to the order BHJ-R (2.30) > BHJ-1 (2.26) > BHJ-6 (2.24) > BHJ-2 = BHJ-4 (2.23) > BHJ-5 (2.20) > BHJ-3 (2.10) > BHJ-1 (1.94). The comparison of these values shows that the acceptor modifications had a great effect on Egap and a significant improvement over the reference molecule BHJ-R, which confirmed that the nature of the acceptor is very important for improving the performance of BHJ. Furthermore, we found that the energy values for the gaps of the BHJ-3 and BHJ-7 molecules are more interesting than the other molecules. Therefore, the addition of cyano in the acceptor gave a large effect compared to fluoro and chloro. Moreover, the energy diagram (Fig. 4) shows that the LUMO energy level of all the compounds obtained from DFT calculations is much higher than that of the conduction band of PC61BM, which shows that the photo-excited charge transfer compounds (BHJ-R and BHJ-i (i = 1–7)) to PC61BM is possible.53
3.3. Frontier molecular orbitals
The intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the donor group and the acceptor group is one of the most important characteristics in the study of BHJ solar cells.54 For this reason, we have determined those from the structures optimized by the method DFT/B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) the orbitals HOMO and LUMO, which are shown in Fig. 5. According to this figure, the electron density of the HOMO level in the ground state is located on the π-spacer and the donor group for all molecules. While the density of the LUMO level is located mainly on the acceptor group and the π-spacer of the structure, this localization of the electron density on the π-spacer and the electron accepting group indicates that these are the richest parts in π electrons.

3.4. Intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) properties
For a better understanding of the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process, we show in Fig. 6 the difference the electron density (Δρ) between the first excited state and the ground state. The purple and blue color represents the regions where the electrons are coming from and where the electrons are going. To analyze, we prpose that the decreases (in blue) are mainly localized on donor (D) and π-spacer (π), while the increases (in purple) show localized electron densities on the acceptor (A) for all compounds, this means that the localized electron densities indicate that the electron charge transfer occur in all molecules.55 Additionally, we determined the CT parameters, such as the spatial distance (DCT), the transferred charge (qCT) and H, presenting half of the sum of the centroid axis along the direction of the electron transfer, the results are shown in Fig. 7. The transferred charges (qCT) can be obtained by integrating ρ+ (r) and ρ− (r), as follows: (1)where ρ+ (r) and ρ− (r) are increments and depletion of the density. The barycenters of the density distribution corresponding to r+ and r− can be expressed as: (2) (3)
 Fig. 6  Computed charge density difference (Δρ) and electron density difference maps (EDDM) between the ground state to S1 excited states with an isosurface value of 0.0004 a.u are shown on the left. 
 Fig. 7  Calculated charge transfer parameters of investigated compounds. 
The spatial distance (DCT) can be denoted by the distance between two barycenters r+ and r−, which are described as: DCT = |r+ − r−|(4)
The calculated values are presented in Fig. 7. As shown in Fig. 7, the values of qCT in e− are increase in the following order BHJ-6 (0.565) < BHJ-2(0.593) < BHJ-5 (0.594) < BHJ-4(0.595) < BHJ-1(0.597) < BHJ-R (0.599) < BHJ-7(0.650) < BHJ-3(0.690), it means that BHJ-3 has the best load transfer performance and had higher efficiency. Then, the calculated values of DCT in A° are increased in the following order BHJ-R (4.916) < BHJ-1(4.937) < BHJ-2(4.999) < BHJ-4(5.012) < BHJ-5 (5.065) < BHJ-6 (5.088) < BHJ-7(5.406) < BHJ-3(5.496); this means that BHJ-3 has the electron-rich acceptor that would have a crucial effect on the ICT that confirmed that the addition of cyano in the acceptor gave a large effect compared to fluoro and chloro. Furthermore, H is another very important parameter in load transfer. The calculated values of H also show that BHJ-3 has the largest H, which confirms that its acceptor is the best acceptor to use in BHJ cells.
3.5. Molecular electrostatic potential (MEP)
The molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) for the eight compounds is shown in Fig. 8 using the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. As we know, the purpose of the MEP is to know the reactive zones of electrophilic and nucleophilic attacks on the studied molecules. The analysis of this figure shows that the negative zone in red is mainly localized around oxygen and nitrogen atoms of the acceptor groups for all compounds and this zone is for electrophilic attacks. On the other hand, we found the absence of the positive in the blue area in all the compounds, which indicates that all the molecules have zero potential.

3.6. Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis
From a theoretical point of view, charge transfer transitions have been the subject of numerous studies.56–59 In order to approach this estimation of the charge transfer in the molecules (D–π–A), studied between the donor and the acceptor, we proceeded to determine the charge distribution by NBO performed from the optimized ground state structure (S0) obtained at DFT/B3LYP/6-31G(d,p). The NBO population charge for the electron donor, π-spacer, and electron acceptor, which are denoted as qDonor, qπ-spacer, and qAcceptor, respectively, are represented in Table 3. On another side, the most significant difference in charge between the natural charges on the donor and acceptor groups is represented by ΔqD–A.

By comparing the results obtained for the compounds BHJ-R and BHJ-i (i = 1–7), the donor part has a positive charge, while the acceptor part has a negative one. Therefore, the positive values of the atomic charges of the donor groups suggest that they are all capable of donating electrons. While the negative charges found on the acceptor show their strong capacity to attract electrons. In addition, during photoexcitation, the electrons from the donor group are transferred to the acceptor group through thiophene, thus allowing good charge separation in the molecules. Also, for ΔqD–A, the value of BHJ-3 is higher than others molecules, which confirmed that the two substituted cyano groups (–CN) at the acceptor part are easier to transfer charge from the donor to acceptor than other acceptors.
3.7. Quantum chemical parameters
From the structures optimized by the DFT/B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) method, we determined many chemical parameters, chemical hardness (η), chemical potential (μ), and electronegativity (χ) can be calculated using the HOMO and LUMO energy values as follows:60 (5) (6) (7)
The calculated quantum-chemical parameter values of the eight compounds are listed in Table 4. From the results, it is noted that the PC61BM (−4.93 eV) compound has the smallest value of the chemical potential (μ) compared to the other compounds and it means that the passage of electrons will take place from the compounds having the greatest chemical potential towards the compound which has the smallest chemical potential. Therefore, PC61BM will behave as an electron acceptor while the others will behave as electron donors. For electronegativity (χ), we found that PC61BM (4.93 eV) has the highest value indicating that PC61BM has the ability to attract electrons from all the studied compounds. Besides, the chemical hardness (η) of PC61BM (1.18 eV) has a high value (η) compared to all other compounds, indicating that the electron transfer from these compounds to PC61BM is very easy. Finally, we notice that the value of the dipole moment (ρ) for BHJ-3 (ρ = 19.17 D) molecule is higher than those of the other compounds, indicating that this molecule is more reactive. Indeed, this compound promotes the release of electrons in PC61BM.

 Fig. 9  Simulated UV-visible optical absorption spectra of all compounds with data calculated using TD-DFT at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. 
The maximum absorption wavelengths (λabs), vertical excitation energy (ΔEexcit), oscillator strength (ƒ), and light-harvesting efficiency (LHE) in the solvent (chloroform) of all the molecules calculated at the TD-DFT/CAM-B3LYP/6-31G level(d,p) are presented in Table 5 and Fig. 9. As it is known, the position and the width of the main band of the absorption spectrum are the main parameters that can influence the light-collecting process and therefore the efficiency of BHJ. As shown in Table 5, the most intense contribution to the main band is the first H–L singlet excitation. Also, the first vertical excitation energies (ΔE) in eV of the compounds are classified in decreasing order BHJ-7 (2.0573) < BHJ-3 (2.1328) < BHJ-5 (2.1947) < BHJ-2 (2.2268) < BHJ-4 (2.2338) < BHJ-6 (2.2479) < BHJ-1 (2.2650) < BHJ-R (2.3009) showing that there is a shift in the absorption spectrum towards the red (bathochromic) when passing from BHJ-7 to BHJ-R. This indicates that the BHJ-7 and BHJ-3 molecules that have the lowest excitation energy could dramatically improve the potential for light harvesting in the long wavelength region. As well, all compounds have a higher oscillator force (ƒ) than the base molecule BHJ-R (1.6359) except BHJ-4 (1.6250) and BHJ-7 (0.7995), which demonstrates that the change at the acceptor group level is a promising strategy to improve light-harvesting properties. Table 5 also shows that there is a bathochromic shift when going from BHJ-R to BHJ-7 in the following order BHJ-R (538.86 nm) < BHJ-1 (547.39 nm) < BHJ-6 (551.54 nm) < BHJ-4 (555.03 nm) < BHJ-2 (556.79 nm) < BHJ-5 (564.92 nm) < BHJ-3 (581.32 nm) < BHJ-7 (602.66 nm), which is consistent with the theoretical results describing the evolution of the energy gap. Indeed, BHJ-3 and BHJ-7 compounds, which have the lowest energy gap of 2.10 eV for BHJ-3 and 1.94 eV for BHJ-7 and the highest values of the absorption maximum of 581.32 nm for BHJ-3 and 602.66 nm for BHJ-7 are promising materials for applications in the field of organic electronics. It is also noted that the values obtained from the LHE of all the dyes are between 0.841 and 0.984, these values are very similar and show that all these molecules will give a similar photo-current. Fig. 9 shows that all compounds have the same absorption profile, an intense main band is produced at higher energies of 400–700 nm in the visible region. This shows that there is a bathochromic shift during the passage from BHJ-R to BHJ-1. More specifically, the cyano substitution in the acceptor leads to a bathochromic shift better than the other substitutions. Finally, we found that the BHJ-3 molecule has the longest absorption wavelength (λabs) among all the studied molecules, as such, this molecule may have more remarkable properties in photo-physical domains.
3.9. Photovoltaic properties
As is known, the values of the energies of HOMO and LUMO molecular orbitals of the studied donor compounds (BHJ-R and BHJ-i (i = 1–7)) are very important parameters for determining the conversion efficiency (η), which closely depends on the value of the open circuit voltage according to the following equation: (8)with Jsc is short-circuit current density, FF is a fill factor, Pinc is incident power and Voc is open circuit voltage. We note that the decrease in the HOMO value of the π-conjugated molecule leads to an increase in the value of Voc and consequently to an increase in the efficiency of solar cells. In this work, we theoretically estimated the value of the open circuit voltage by a simple relation that connects the HOMO energy of the donor material (BHJ-R and BHJ-i (i = 1–7)) and the LUMO energy of the acceptor material (PC61BM).64 (9)where q represents the elementary charge and the value 0.3 eV presents the empirical factor proposed by Scharber and his collaborators,65,66 calculated using the −3.75 eV value of LUMO energy for PC61BM.
On another side, the efficiency of photovoltaic cells also depends on the parameter determined by the difference between the LUMO energy level of the studied compounds and the LUMO energy level of PC61BM as follows: αi = EDonarLUMO (Bi) − EAcceptorLUMO (PC61BM)(10)
From the estimated values of Voc presented in Table 6, we can notice that they are between 1.05 and 1.63 eV and increase in the following order: BHJ-7 < BHJ-6 < BHJ-R < BHJ-1 < BHJ-5 < BHJ-4 < BHJ-2 < BHJ-3. Thus, BHJ-3 is the molecule that presents itself with the highest Voc. On the other hand, the energy difference, LUMO (Donor)–LUMO (Acceptor), between the LUMO of the electron donors (BHJ-R and BHJ-i (i = 1–7)) and the LUMO of the electron acceptor PC61BM is greater than 0 eV. This shows that electron transfer takes place from the donor (BHJ-R and BHJ-i (i = 1–7)) to the acceptor (PC61BM). Therefore, based on the good results found from αi and Voc for the compound BHJ-3, we can suggest that it is the best candidate for applications in BHJ.

3.10 Photovoltaic performances of BHJ compounds by the Scharber model
The Scharber diagram is used to predict the efficiency of the photovoltaic conversion of donor conjugated molecules BHJ-R and BHJ-i (i = 1–7) with PC61BM as the acceptor.67Fig. 10 shows how this efficiency can be calculated from the band gap energy and [ELUMO (donor) − ELUMO (acceptor)]. From this figure, we noticed that the theoretical efficiency of these compounds varies between 4.5 and 7%. Compounds BHJ-5 and BHJ-7 achieve greater than 7% efficiency, again suggesting that these compounds might be better donors for use in BHJ solar cells.

3.11. QSPR models

3.11.1 Alignment protocol with different charges. 
Based on the DFT and TD-DFT results, we found that the BHJ-3 molecule proved to be the best candidate for BHJ, due to its particular properties and its interesting values of influencing parameters such as Voc. For this purpose, 3D-QSPR models have been developed, through which we can predict the optimal 3D properties required to improve the properties Voc of the examined BHJ molecules (Fig. 11) based on the structure of the template molecule BHJ-3 (Fig. 12). Fig. 11 shows the database of the eight BHJ molecules after their alignment with the template molecule BHJ-3 (Fig. 12A).
 Fig. 11  Molecular alignment of BHJ compounds with the BHJ-3 template molecule. 
 Fig. 12  (A) Structure of the template molecule BHJ-R, (B) common core used in alignment. 
From Fig. 11, we can see that the eight compounds (BHJ-R and BHJ-i (i = 1–7)) are perfectly aligned with the structure of the BHJ-3 molecule (Fig. 12), which can be confirmed by the correct overlap between the eight compounds. Thus, the data relating to the structure of the studied molecules can be obtained more efficiently by calculating the field descriptors (steric (S), eelectrostatic (E), hydrophobic (H), hydrogen bonds donor (D), and hydrogen bonds acceptor (A)) associated with the indole-based structure.


3.11.2 Partial least square analysis (PLS). 
The partial least squares method was used to establish the linear models between the descriptors of CoMFA and CoMSIA with the property Voc. In this work, we used the statistical indices obtained from the PLS analysis of the CoMFA and CoMSIA models in order to verify the capacity of these models to establish a quantitative relationship between the 3D structure of the compounds studied and the Voc property. Therefore, we evaluated the statistical indices conventional correlation coefficient R2 (eqn (11)), standard error of estimate SEE (eqn (12)), cross-validation correlation coefficient Q2 (eqn (13)), and Fisher test F as the internal test and Y-randomization as an external test for the two developed models.68–70 (11) (12) (13)where Yclc, Yobs, and Ȳ represent the predicted, observed, and averaged values of Voc, n-(k + 1) degrees of freedom, and n is the number of variables.

Table 7 shows the output of statistical PLS analyses obtained via CoMFA and CoMSIA. From Table 7, we can observe that 3D-QSPR models developed via CoMFA and CoMSIA exhibited high stability and efficiency, as represented by high values of R2 (0.988 and 0.986), Q2 (0.62 and 0.58), F (56.97 and 45.44) and low SEE (0.027 and 0.033) values, respectively, for CoMFA and CoMSIA models. The good R2 values (close to 1) can be confirmed by the linear stability of observed Vocversus predicted Voc values from the CoMFA (Fig. 13A) and CoMSIA (Fig. 14B) models. Also, low SEE values can be justified by their plots (Fig. 13B and 14B), which indicate the slight limitation of normalized residual values between the Voc values observed and predicted by the QSPR/CoMFA and QSPR/CoMSIA models. Moreover, from the contribution fractions, we can see that the Voc property of BHJ molecules is strongly correlated with S, E, H, and A descriptors.

Moreover, we performed the Y randomization test by five randomized trials. We performed this test by the random redistribution of the Voc values observed to the studied BHJ molecules. The Y-randomization test was performed by performing a random reconstruction of the 3D-QSPR models under the same assumptions under which the QSPR original models were developed. In this test, new values of R2 and Q2 were obtained for the random models, and the limit of the difference between the values (R2) of the original model and those (Rr2) of the random model was measured by the indicator cRp2 (eqn (14)).71 (14)
Furthermore, the model tested is strong and the correlation obtained between the calculated molecular descriptors and the property predicted if the R and Q values of the random models are lower than the R and Q values of the original models. Also, the cRp2 value must be greater than 0.5 to exclude the hypothesis that the efficiency of the models developed was obtained by chance. Table 9 presents the results of the Y-randomization test obtained for both the CoMFA and CoMSIA models.

Table 9 shows that the values of R2 and Q2 for the five random models are lower than their correspondents in the original models and that the mean values of cRp2 are greater than 0.5. This indicates that the performance of the CoMFA and CoMSIA models developed was not the result of chance.


3.11.3 3D analysis of the CoMFA and CoMSIA. 
Concerning the 3D molecular descriptors represented by the fractions of the fields S, E, H, D, and A in Table 7, we can see that the CoMFA model was developed by the descriptors S and E with high contributions of 0.573 and 0.427, respectively. Also, the CoMSIA model was developed by the contribution of each of the fields S of 0.085, E of 0.228, H of 0.337, and A of 0.35, while the D field did not contribute to the development of this model. To confirm our choice of the BHJ-3 molecule as the best molecule in use as a donor in BHJ and to improve the Voc property of these molecules, we show the contour maps generated from the analysis of the CoMFA models. And CoMSIA developed to describe the 3D structural requirements of the BHJ-3 compound. In this work, we show all the contours expressing contributions of 80% for the favorable areas and 20% unfavorable for the properties of Voc in Fig. 15 and 16, respectively.

 Fig. 16  (A) Steric fields, (B) electrostatic fields, (C) hydrophobic fields, (D) bond donor fields (E) and magenta outlines of CoMSIA. 
From Fig. 15, we can note that the green contour (Fig. 15A) indicates the appropriate site for introducing large groups to improve the Voc power. This hypothesis is confirmed from the data in Table 6 when the hydrogen molecules in the ortho and meta sites of the base molecule BHJ-R (Voc = 1.27) have been substituted by atoms of fluorine and chlorine. The Voc property of these molecules increased to 1.36 (BHJ-1) and 1.41 (BHJ-2). On the other hand, in the electrostatic contour maps of CoMFA (Fig. 15B), the blue contour indicates the region where the positive charge increases Voc, while the red contour indicates the region where the negative charge increases Voc. In addition, from Fig. 16, green contour of steric fields (Fig. 16A) indicates regions where large groups improve Voc, while yellow outlines indicate regions where large groups decrease Voc, which confirms the hypothesis observed by the CoMFA model. Also, for electrostatic fields (Fig. 16B), the red contours indicate the regions where the electron donor groups decrease Voc, and blue outlines show regions where electron donor groups increase Voc. It is then noted that in the hydrophobic fields (C), the yellow contours show that the hydrophobic groups are favorable, while the white contours indicate that the hydrophobic groups are unfavorable. This means that the Voc can increase when the phthalonitrile group is enriched with hydrophilic radicals. This occurs by the production of a constant electric force between the structure of the studied molecules and the water solution, thanks to the formation of the hydrogen bonds between the two poles (compound-aqueous solution). On the other hand, from Fig. 16D, we can see that the descriptor (D) did not generate any contour on the structure of the BHJ-3 molecule, this can be explained by the value of zero fraction of this descriptor predicted by the CoMSIA model shown in Table 7. From this observation, the reason why descriptor (D) did not contribute to the development of the CoMSIA model may be due to the fact that there is a strong collinear relationship between this descriptor and descriptor (A). Whereas we notice that the field descriptor (A) in the CoMSIA model is associated with Voc feature by 35% of the contribution (Fig. 16E). From Fig. 16E, the magenta contours show the regions where the H-binding acceptor substituents increase Voc, while the red contours indicate the regions where H-bond acceptor substituents decrease Voc. This means that the Voc property of the studied BHJ compounds may decrease when the acetonitrile or oxygen groups are substituted by hydrogen bond donor radicals. Thanks to 3D-QSPR models obtained via CoMFA and CoMSIA, the most important 3D structural properties favorable to improve the Voc properties of the BHJ molecules examined in this work are reported in Fig. 17. Therefore, the structure of the BHJ-3 molecule can be considered a convenient template for designing new BHJ cell compounds as well as predicting their Voc properties.
 Fig. 17  Structural properties of molecule BHJ-3 adapted for modification and design of other molecules. 
Based on the structural properties obtained by DFT results and 3D-QSPR models, we designed ten new molecules (BHJ-3a, BHJ-3b, BHJ-3c, BHJ-3d, BHJ-3e, BHJ-3f, BHJ-3g, BHJ-3h, BHJ-3i and BHJ-3j). The structures of the proposed molecules and their predicted Voc are presented in Table 10.

From Table 10, we can notice that the Voc values predicted by the CoMFA and CoMSIA models for the ten compounds are significantly improved compared to the Voc value of the reference molecule BHJ-3 (1.63 eV). We also observed that the Voc values predicted by the CoMSIA model are higher than those predicted by the CoMFA model. This signifies that the CoMSIA model accurately described the quantitative relationship between Voc and molecular fields steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic, and hydrogen bonds acceptor.
The discrepancy between the Voc values predicted by the CoMFA and CoMSIA models can be explained by the fact that the CoMFA model predicted the Voc values based on the contributions of the S, E field descriptors only, whereas, the CoMSIA model predicted the Voc values based on the contributions of all four field descriptors S, E, H, and A. Therefore, changes at the π-spacer level showed a significant positive effect on improving Voc values. Table 11 in the attached file presents the contour maps generated by the CoMSIA model regarding the contributions of the S, E, H, and A field descriptors on the structure of newly designed molecules (BHJ-3a, BHJ-3b, BHJ-3c, BHJ-3d, BHJ-3e, BHJ-3f, BHJ-3g, BHJ-3h, BHJ-3i, and BHJ-3j). From the above, we can conclude that the integration of 3D-QSPR with DFT, and TD-DFT analysis was favorable for designing new BHJ compounds with high Voc efficiency.

4. Conclusion
In this work, the electronic structure and optical properties of eight new molecules based on 8-alkyl-8H-thieno [2,3-b] indole were determined using the density functional theory DFT and its time-dependent variant TD-DFT. We discussed in this article, the electronic properties (EHOMO, ELUMO, and energy gap (Egap)), natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis, quantum chemical parameters (chemical hardness η, chemical potential μ, electronegativity χ), and optical properties. Moreover, the results indicate that the acceptor modifications had a great effect on Egap and a great improvement over the base molecule BHJ-R, confirming that the nature of the acceptor is very important in improving the performance of BHJ. Moreover, all the designed molecules exhibited a reduced energy difference in the order of 2.26 eV to 1.96 eV, compared to the basic molecule BHJ-R (2.30 eV). While the calculation of the different properties of the studied compounds showed that all the studied compounds absorb the visible and exhibit a bathochromic shift. Also, we found that the highest power conversion efficiency estimated by the Scharber's model reached 7%. Indeed, the compound BHJ-3 has a low energy gap and the highest value of maximum absorption is a promoter material for application as a donor in BHJ. Motivated by these results, we developed the 3D-QSPR model based on the CoMFA and CoMSIA approaches to predict the most important three-dimensional properties of BHJ-3. Based on these results, we designed 10 new molecules (BHJ-3a, BHJ-3b, BHJ-3c, BHJ-3d, BHJ-3e, BHJ-3f, BHJ-3g, BHJ-3h, BHJ-3i, and BHJ-3j), which have very interesting Voc values.
