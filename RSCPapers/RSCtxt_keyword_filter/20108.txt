    , Accepted 10th March 2014First published on 10th March 2014AbstractWe have synthesized five novel Ru(II) phenanthroline complexes with an additional aryl sulfonate ligating substituent at the 5-position [Ru(L)(bpy)2](BF4)2 (1), [Ru(L)(bpy)(SCN)2] (2), [Ru(L)3](BF4)2 (3), [Ru(L)2(bpy)](BF4)2 (4) and [Ru(L)(BPhen)(SCN)2] (5) (where L = 6-one-[1,10]phenanthroline-5-ylamino)-3-hydroxynaphthalene 1-sulfonic, bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine, BPhen = 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline), as both photosensitizers for oxide semiconductor solar cells (DSSCs) and light emitting diodes (LEDs). The absorption and emission maxima of these complexes red shifted upon extending the conjugation of the phenanthroline ligand. Ru phenanthroline complexes exhibit broad metal to ligand charge transfer-centered electroluminescence (EL) with a maximum near 580 nm. Our results indicated that a particular structure (2) can be considered as both DSSC and OLED devices. The efficiency of the LED performance can be tuned by using a range of ligands. Device (2) has a luminance of 550 cd m−2 and maximum efficiency of 0.9 cd A−1 at 18 V, which are the highest values among the five devices. The turn-on voltage of this device is approximately 5 V. The role of auxiliary ligands in the photophysical properties of Ru complexes was investigated by DFT calculation. We have also studied photovoltaic properties of dye-sensitized nanocrystalline semiconductor solar cells based on Ru phenanthroline complexes and an iodine redox electrolyte. A solar energy to electricity conversion efficiency (η) of 0.67% was obtained for Ru complex (2) under standard AM 1.5 irradiation with a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 2.46 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 0.6 V, and a fill factor (ff) of 40%, which are all among the highest values for ruthenium sulfonated anchoring groups reported so far. Monochromatic incident photon to current conversion efficiency was 23% at 475 nm. Photovoltaic studies clearly indicated dyes with two SCN substituents yielded a higher Jsc for the cell than dyes with a tris-homoleptic anchor substituent.
1. Introduction
A global challenge is to capture and utilize solar energy for sustainable development and to use the produced energy for low-cost, low-consumption lighting solutions. In this respect dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)1–6 and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs)7–10 represent valuable examples of both technologies, which can also be integrated into a unique photonic device. In light harvesting, the first step in such conversion, the choice of a photosensitizer capable of efficient visible-light absorption is crucial. Therefore, much effort has focused on the design and synthesis of various dyes, including metal complexes and organic dyes.11 Understanding the relationship between the solar cell performance and the properties of sensitizer molecule structures is one of the most important tasks for developing a high performance solar cell. Ruthenium polypyridine dyes have received much attention due to their outstanding performance as sensitizers in DSSCs, reaching efficiencies of up to 11%.12–15 In this respect, the nature of anchoring groups is of utmost importance because it greatly influences the transport and adsorption of the dye onto the semiconductor surface. Moreover, knowledge of the nature and number of binding modes and of the binding geometry are crucial factors for the study of interfacial injection processes, to improve the electrochemical devices, and to design new sensitizers. A number of Ru-polypyridine sensitizers with different anchoring moieties have been reported. Chun-Hui Huang et al. indicated that linking attaching groups such as –RSO3− to hemicyanine dyes results in successful adsorption onto the surface of TiO2 and shows good charge-transfer properties.16–18 Although the formation of an ester-like linkage between carboxylic acid groups of the corresponding bipyridine ligands and TiO2 nanocrystallites is now well established,19–22 there is a lack of experimental data on the kind of chemisorption of dyes bearing sulfonic acid functional groups. Areas of particularly strong interest have been the generation and evaluation of new dyes for intensely luminescent complexes in OLEDs. Since the discovery that Ru(bpy)32+ is electroluminescent,23,24 a large body of literature has appeared aimed at understanding both the ground and excited state properties of Ru(bpy)32+ and its derivatives.25,26 With priorities of electrochemical, photochemical and thermal stability, ruthenium (Ru)-based charge transfer complexes are receiving considerable attention as an important material class for light emitting device study.27,28 By attaching groups such as phosphonato, sulfonato or carboxylato to the bipyridine or phenanthroline moieties, Ru complexes can be linked to biological molecules such as antibodies and DNA, where they serve as a tag or label for analyses, much like radioactive or fluorescent labels.29 This has resulted in a wide range of analytical applications for EL in which Ru polypyridine with anchoring group plays a key role. Moreover, the demonstration of simultaneous multi-color luminescence from metal complexes assemblies using two different strategies: the detection of a picosecond-scale luminescence component from ruthenium polypyridine complexes arising from a non-thermalised excited state; and generation of long lived charge-separated states of up to 1 second in a donor–chromophore–acceptor triad. High-brightness and high-efficiency emissions with low-driving voltage of Ru-complex-based solid and solution-state EL cells have been achieved.30,31 Finally, Ru polypyridine complexes with anchoring group exhibit a variety of low-lying electronically excited states (p–p*, d–d*, d–p* and MLCT), which make them good candidates for both dye sensitized solar cells and light emitting diodes. This paper concerns the synthesis of five novel ruthenium polypyridine complexes by using a π-extended phenanthroline ligand. Our efforts are focused on the finding a dye that could be used as both a dye sensitized solar cell and light emitting diodes.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials and instruments
All chemicals and solvents were purchased from Merck or Aldrich and used without further purification. IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 597 spectrometer. 1H-NMR spectra were recorded by use of a Bruker 250 MHz. Electrochemical measurements were made in DMF using a model SAMA 500 potentiostat. Electrochemical experiments were carried out in an airtight single-compartment cell by using platinum working and counter electrodes and a silver spiral as a quasi-reference electrode. The supporting electrolyte was 0.1 M [Bu4N]BF4. Ferrocene was added as an internal standard after each set of measurements, and all potentials reported were quoted with reference to the ferrocene–ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) couple at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The oxidation (Eox) and reduction (Ered) potentials were used to determine the HOMO and LUMO energy levels using the equations EHOMO = −(Eox + 4.8) eV and ELUMO = −(Ered + 4.8) eV, which were calculated using the internal standard ferrocene value of −4.8 eV with respect to the vacuum.32,33 The PL spectra of the ruthenium compounds and PVK:PBD were measured in 1,2-dimethylformamide solution. The PL spectra were recorded with an Ocean Optic spectrometer USB2000 during 405 nm irradiation. The photocurrent–voltage (I–V) characteristics were recorded using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter under air mass (AM) 1.5 simulated illumination (100 mW cm−2). The action spectra of monochromatic incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for solar cells were performed using a commercial setup for IPCE measurement (PV-25 DYE, JASCO). Full geometric optimization and the calculation of the energetics for all of the structural variables were obtained using the B3LYP/LanL2DZ method. All calculations and optimizations were performed using the Gaussian 03 package.34
2.2 Preparation of EL devices and testing
The structure of the fabricated device is as follows:
ITO/PEDOT:PSS(90 nm)/PVK:PBD(70 nm)/Al(200 nm) and ITO/PEDOT:PSS(90 nm)/PVK:PBD:ruthenium complex (70 nm)/Al(200 nm), as shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  The layer arrangement of the Ru-based LED-device. 
PVK as a hole-transporting material and PBD as an electron-transporting material were doped with ruthenium compounds. Glass substrates, coated with ITO (sheet resistance of 70 Ω m−2), were used as the conducting anode. The ratio of ruthenium complexes for each type were 10 wt% in PVK:PBD (100:40). PEDOT:PSS(poly(3,4-ethylenedi-oxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)) was used as a hole injection and transporting layer.
All polymeric layers were successively deposited onto the ITO coated-glass by using a spin-coating process from the solution. A metallic cathode of Al was deposited on the emissive layer at 8 × 10−5 mbar by thermal evaporation. The PEDOT:PSS was dissolved in DMF, spin coated onto ITO and was held in an oven at 120 °C for 2 hours after deposition. PVK:PBD and ruthenium complexes with a ratio of 10:4:1 were blended in DMF, and then spin coated and baked at 80 °C for 1 hour. The thickness of the polymeric thin film was determined by a Dektak 8000. The EL intensity and spectra were measured with an Ocean Optic USB2000 under ambient conditions. In addition, a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter was used to measure the electrical characteristics of the devices.
2.3 Fabrication of DSSC
To prepare the DSSC working electrodes, the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) glass used as current collector was first cleaned in a detergent solution using an ultrasonic bath for 15 min, and then rinsed with water and ethanol. The mesoscopic TiO2 film used as photoanodes consisted of layers of TiO2. TiCl4 treatment was applied to the prepared TiO2 films. The sintered TiO2 films were dipped in an aqueous solution of 50 mM TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 min, and sintered again for 30 min at 450 °C (10 μm thick transparent layer of 25 nm TiO2 anatase nanoparticles and a 5 μm thick scattering layer of 400 nm anatase TiO2 particles). The sintered TiO2 electrode was then immersed for 16 h in a 3 × 10−4 M DMF solution of the dyes. The counter electrode was prepared on a bare FTO substrate. The Pt precursor was prepared by H2PtCl6, and spread on the front side of the FTO glass. The electrolyte consisted of 0.1 M LiI, 0.03 M I2, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in 3-methoxypropionitrile.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of complexes
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the ligand (L) and the complexes (1–5) in acetonitrile solution are given in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 2  Absorption spectra of ruthenium complexes (1–5) in acetonitrile solution (10−5 M). 
It can be seen that the absorption bands of ligands appear in the ultraviolet region at around 220–310 nm due to π–π* transitions of the aromatic rings. Free (L) shows three bands at 230, 265 and 305 nm. Moreover, three bands at 218, 260 and 310 nm were observed for bpy. As shown in Fig. 2, the absorption spectra of the complexes show intense bands in the ultraviolet region, which can be attributed to the spin allowed π* transitions of the (L) and bpy or BPhen ligands. It shows that after coordination the absorption bands reveal a red-shift owing to the formation of the rigid conjugated system after coordination, which confirms that the UV spectra of the complexes reflect essentially absorption of the ligands.
The broad absorption bands from 400 nm extending to 600 nm correspond to both spin allowed and spin forbidden metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transitions. The intensity of the spin forbidden bands arises from the strong spin orbit coupling of ruthenium(II), which causes mixing with higher-lying spin allowed transitions.
The PL characteristics of the ruthenium complexes are shown in Fig. 3. The PL emission spectra of the complexes in DMF solution were obtained by exciting with a wavelength of 405 nm. As shown in Fig. 3, the Ru complexes emit yellowish-green light at room temperature with emission maxima (lem) at 530 and 570 nm. The broad spectra indicates that the emissive excited states of the complexes have more characteristics of MLCT rather than ligand to ligand charge transfer (π→π*). In Fig. 3, a red shift and a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) enhancement of the emission peaks were observed for complex (2) as compared to the other complexes. Appending aryl sulfonato functionalities also profoundly increases electronic delocalization in the excited state of conjugated systems, inducing significant red-shifts in emission wavelength, and increasing emission intensity. Interestingly, the extended conjugation of the phen ligand at a particular position produced dual emission that was readily resolved in both energy and lifetime.30,36 In contrast to compounds (2) and (5), complex (3) exhibited lower luminescent properties than (2) and (5); the additional conjugation to the metal center did not seem to have any impact on the coordination complex when three phen aryl sulfonate ligands were coordinated to ruthenium. To our knowledge, this is not the first report of surprising substitution effects at this position of the phen ligand. Wallace et al. discovered that substitution at the 4,7-positions had a far greater impact than any other substitution position on the MLCT energy at room temperature for ruthenium complexes, and reported low-temperature dual emission of the “distinct orbital type” for these systems.37–39 In contrast, Yitzhak Tor clearly indicated that both states display the characteristics of 3MLCT states, with regard to energy and excited-state lifetime.36
 Fig. 3  PL spectra of ruthenium complexes (1–5) in DMF solution 10−5 M (λexc = 405 nm). 
The different photophysical processes in the ruthenium polypyridine complexes are summarized in Fig. 4. It is useful to note such a dpRu(II)→p*L/bpy based 3MLCT transition band in the region 450–550 nm has been observed earlier by many researchers for various Ru(II)–polypyridine complexes.40 Also, the combination of 3MLCT and 3LLCT absorption bands was responsible for the broad absorption spectrum in the longer wavelength region. In normal 3MLCT emission, the 3MLCT is populated by internal conversion (IC) between the S1 and the 1MLCT and a subsequent 1MLCT–3MLCT ISC (upon excitation at 400 nm) or by direct inter system crossing (ISC) between the photoexcited 1MLCT (upon excitation at 525 nm) and the 3MLCT. The crossing of 3MLCT states to lower energy 3ILCT or 3LLCT excited states creates the inherent lower energy of 3ILCT or 3LLCT states with respect to the 3MLCT excited state, which leads to photoluminescence in the near-IR region.
 Fig. 4  Simplified energy level diagram and the emission states for Ru polypyridine complexes. (a) Normal 3MLCT emission; (b) 3ILCT/3LLCT emission. 
The internal conversion from 3MLCT to 3ILCT or/and 3LLCT states is reported as a dominant fast phase emission quenching of the 3MLCT state in the sub-ns time domain.41 It is useful to note that the ligand localized CT states (3ILCT or 3LLCT) emission is too low to observe in emission spectroscopy at room temperature.42 Earlier, the 3MLCT→3ILCT internal conversion is reported by Charlot et al43 to be as fast as ∼100 ps. Generally, ruthenium polypyridine complexes exhibit long 3MLCT lifetimes from millisecond to microsecond. As an example, a family of Ru(II) complexes containing substituted 1,10-phenanthroline ligands with extended conjugation display two simultaneously emissive 3MLCT excited states in solutions at room temperature, originating from bpy-based (t = 0.9 to 2.2 ms) and longer lived phen-based (t = 3.7 to 11.5 ms) excited states.44 Therefore, the assignment of 3ILCT and 3LLCT to emission bands at centered 570 nm will be ruled out and 3MLCT→S1 will be reasonable.
The main absorption peaks in the IR spectra of complexes (1–5) are summarized in Table 1. Generally, in the IR spectrum of phen, strong bands were observed in frequency region between 1400 and 1650 cm−1, the one band occurring at 1505 cm−1, the second appearing at 1590 cm−1 and the third band at 1423 cm−1.

In the present study, the IR spectrum of (L) shows a ν(C–N) band related to phen at 1422 cm−1, indicating the partial double bond character. The ring frequencies associated with phen are observed at 1497 and 1601 cm−1 for (L). The ν(C–H) of phen bands appear at 2876, 2946 and 2965 cm−1. In the aryl sulfonyl ligand (L), bands at 1290, 1090, 684 and 561 cm−1 are derived from the presence of SO3. The vibration band at 1030–1090 cm−1 is characteristic of the vibrations of the sulfur atoms linked to the aromatic cycle and of SO symmetric vibration.45 The asymmetric SO vibration is observed at 1220–1290 cm−1. It is important to note that the disappearance of the ν(NH2) stretching frequency of the amine group and appearance of ν(NH) stretching at 3445 cm−1 in the IR spectrum of (L) reveals the formation of (L). The region of particular interest is between 1800 and 1000 cm−1, as the various C–O stretching bands that are found here indicate the types of C–O bonding present in the molecule. This region is complicated, with vibrations of the bpy framework and sulfonate groups all contributing to the spectrum. In the IR spectra of complexes (1–5), strong peaks at 2918–2922 cm−1 for complexes (1–5) were assigned to the (C–H) group, and a strong absorption at 1226–1290 cm−1 for all complexes (1–5) corresponds to the ν(SO3) vibration of the sulfonate group. The NCS– group has two characteristic modes, ν(NC) and ν(CS), which are frequently considered as diagnostic with respect to the coordination mode of the ambidentate NCS ligand. The IR spectra of complexes (4) and (2) show an intense absorbance at 2088 cm−1 and 2097 cm−1, respectively, for ν(NC) and 780 and 785 cm−1, respectively, for ν(CS) due to the N-coordinated NCS ligand. There are a number of bands at lower energy (to 1000 cm−1) in the dyes that contain both C–C, C–N and S–O stretching and S–O deformation character. Further information on the complexes was obtained from 1H-NMR spectroscopy. 1H-NMR spectra of all complexes show all peaks of synthesized ligand (L), bpy, phen and BPhen in the region 7.5–10.8 ppm, which indicates the presence of the ligands in the complexes. The signal integration for complex (1) reveals the incorporation of one (L) and two bpy units. For complex (2), two (L) units and one bpy unit were found by signal integration. Three and two (L) units were revealed by signal integration for complexes (3) and (4), respectively. The signal integration for complex (5) reveals the incorporation of one BPhen and two (L) units. The difference between the chemical shift of the free ligands and the complexes indicates that the coordination of ligands to metal has occurred. The cyclic voltammograms of complexes (1–5) show features characteristic for ruthenium–polypyridine complexes, with a reversible metal based oxidation (RuIII/RuII) at positive potentials from +0.9 (V) to +1.4 (V) and four quasi-reversible reductions at negative potentials from −1.1 (V) to −1.9 (V) (ESI,† S2). The first reduction wave is due to the reduction of the sulfonyl ligand, and is followed, at more negative potentials, by three successive electron reduction of the bpy or phen ligands.46 The LUMO and HOMO of the ground state of the dyes (1–5) are about 2.3–3.8 and 3.0–5.4 V versus NHE. These energy levels of LUMO and HOMO are able to inject energetically electrons into the conduction band of TiO2 and accept electrons from iodide ions, respectively.
3.2 EL characterization

Fig. 5 shows the EL spectra of PVK:PBD and ruthenium complexes (1–5) in the PVK:PBD blend. An emissive layer without any ruthenium complex was fabricated to record the PVK:PBD EL spectra and to find a relationship between the EL spectra of the ruthenium compounds and PVK:PBD EL in order to separate it from the emission of ruthenium complexes (Fig. 5). In the EL spectra, the ruthenium complexes show a long red shift compared to the PVK:PBD EL spectrum, demonstrating that effective energy transfer is taking place in the emissive layer. As the driving voltage is biased to electrodes, the electrons and holes begin to inject into the bulk. Some of the electrons and holes under the electromagnetic forces emit light with their mobility between HOMO and LUMO energy levels of layers.
 Fig. 5  EL spectra of PVK:PBD and ruthenium complexes (1–5) in the PVK:PBD blend. 
To achieve a good balance of holes and electrons, both hole and electron-transporting functions (PVK:PBD) were incorporated into a single Ru emitter. It should be noted that our results show that a high ratio of PBD leads to lower stability of the device due to the decrease in the ratio of PVK.
However, the ruthenium devices made without PBD in the blend layer are weakly electroluminescent and PVK is the dominant emitter. Finally, the efficient ratio of 10:4:1 for PVK:PBD:dye was suggested, which reduces the risk of excimer formation and increases the stability of the device. The use of a PEDOT:PSS interlayer helps also better hole injection into the emissive layer and results in increasing the current and the probability of exciton formation.
The formation of Forster transfer is possible in Ru complexes since there is overlap between the absorption spectra of dyes and emission spectra of PVK:PBD. Moreover, the arrangement of layers caused the Forster transfer of energy from PVK:PBD host to ruthenium complexes (Fig. 6). This arrangement indicates that the NCS ligand can directly affect the position of the HOMO energy level, in which the HOMO is delocalized over the NCS ligands. As shown in Fig. 6, these arrangements of energy levels also allow ruthenium complexes between the electron transport layer (PBD) and hole injector layer (PVK). As shown in Fig. 5, device (2) gives the highest EL efficiency compared with other devices. The maxima of EL for Ru complexes (1–5) were centered at 580 nm. The electroluminescence spectrum results in CIE color coordinates of x = 0.51 and y = 0.41 for dye (2), corresponding to red emission. Fig. 7 shows the variation of current with respect to voltage increase. As shown in Fig. 7, all devices show rapid growth in current at voltages higher than 8 V. It means that at this voltage the potential barrier for charge injection is overcome by the electric field exerted between anode and cathode, and helps the rise in the current. In addition, at specified voltage, for example 15 V, sample (2) has the highest current compared to others. In addition, at higher voltages, it is obvious that all samples depict relatively similar behavior in current change with voltage.

 Fig. 7  Current versus applied voltage for devices (1–5). 
The device (2) also has a luminance of 550 cd m−2 and maximum efficiency of 0.9 cd A−1 at 18 V, which are the highest values among the five devices. Fig. 8 shows the maximum efficiency (LE) versus applied voltages (V) characteristics of the Ru devices (1–5). The turn-on voltage of this device is approximately 5 V. For device (2), the full width at half-maximum (FWHM), and the correlated color temperature (CCT) at 18 V were 103 nm and 2145 K, respectively.

3.3 DFT calculation
DFT calculations were also performed to aid in the interpretation of the role of the ligands in electron transfer mechanisms of the Ru complexes. The optimized structures of the different donor and acceptor moieties of the ruthenium complexes used in this study are shown in Fig. 9.
 Fig. 9  Optimized structures of novel ruthenium complexes (1–5). 

Fig. 10 shows the five highest and five lowest molecular orbital energy levels of the Ru complexes. Note that the LUMO energy level of the complex (1) containing two bpy groups is relatively higher than those of the other complexes, with an estimated value of 0.70–1.3 eV, and that the HOMO energy level is relatively higher than those of the other complexes with a difference of approximately 0.605–1.21 eV. This makes the HOMO–LUMO gaps of the complex (2–5) models smaller compared to complex (1). The presence of synthesized ligand (L) in the ruthenium complexes decreases the HOMO–LUMO gap.
 Fig. 10  Diagram of the five highest occupied and five lowest unoccupied molecular orbital levels of novel ruthenium complexes (1–5). 
Another interesting feature found in Fig. 10 is the minimal difference in the bpy ligand of their HOMO and LUMO levels.
The bpy ligand has little influence on the HOMO and LUMO levels in complex (1), which is in congruence with the theoretical results of our group. For the acceptor moiety, sulfonic acid is the main functional group, and it is an anchoring functional group for titanium dioxide, similarly existing in the structure of the chosen acceptor moieties. The presence of such an additional 1-naphthalene carboxylic acid group decreased their LUMO energy levels considerably relative to three (1-naphthalene sulfonic acid) groups in complex (3), by approximately 0.694 eV compared with that of complex (1). Overall, complex (1) had the highest LUMO level and complexes (2) and (5) had the lowest LUMO level, with a 1.3 eV difference relative to each other. The relative positions of the LUMO levels for the donor and acceptor moieties are very important for charge transport to be effective.47,48 Comparing the LUMO levels of the donor moieties complexes (1–5) with those of the acceptor moiety would show that the donor complex (1) moiety has a LUMO level higher than the acceptor moiety complexes (2) and (5). Complex (1) has a higher LUMO level relative to the complex (2) to (5) acceptor moiety. The donor and acceptor moieties cited above have a LUMO donor–LUMO acceptor difference that ranges from approximately 0.35–0.62 eV, which is sufficient for charge transport. Fig. 11 shows the HOMO and LUMO orbital spatial orientation of the novel ruthenium complexes (1–5). Mizuseki et al.49 suggested that the charge transport was related to the spatial distribution of the frontier orbitals. The HOMO should be localized in the donor moiety and the LUMO in the acceptor moiety.50,51 Regarding the HOMO–LUMO gap in the [RuL]2+ complexes, it appears in the order [Ru(L)(bpy)(SCN)2] (2) ∼ Ru(L)(BPhen)(SCN)2](BF4)2 (5) > [Ru(L)(bpy)2](BF4)2 (1) ∼ [Ru(L)3](BF4)2 (3) ∼ [Ru(L)2(bpy)](BF4)2 (4). Considering the HOMO–LUMO gap, the common features of the UV-Vis absorption spectra are as follows. (i) The MLCT transitions are hypsochromically shifted in the presence of the SCN ligand, ranging from 440 nm for (2) to 485 nm for (3). On the other hand, Π-conjugated ligand is bathochemically shifted MLCT transition. (ii) Broad bands in the visible region correspond to the envelope of the Ru–bpy/BPhen and Ru–L MLCT transitions. It is useful to note that the status of HOMO and LUMO levels of complexes is important to electron injection in OLED and DSSC. The best match between the LUMO level of the dye and the conduction band of TiO2 has been achieved by complex (2). So, we conclude that the presence of bpy and SCN is the best configuration for the DSSC based sulfonate anchoring group.
 Fig. 11  Molecular orbital spatial orientation for complexes (1–5). 
In our calculations, complex (1) with the donor having a higher LUMO level has its HOMO localized in the donor and acceptor regions and its LUMO localized in the donor region. Complexes (2) and (5) have (–NCS) groups in their structure, which caused the localization of the LUMO in the acceptor region. The HOMO of structure (1) is localized in the donor moiety and the LUMO is mostly in the same region. The same trend was observed for the orbital spatial orientation of ruthenium complex analogues, as shown in Fig. 11. The presence of ruthenium metal might be responsible for the delocalization of both the HOMO and LUMO, suggesting the presence of a metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) or metal-centered transitions from both the metal and the ligand p orbitals in the LUMO.52 Another noteworthy feature in Fig. 10 is the effect of the presence of (–NCS) groups in the donor moiety of structures (2) and (5). The electron-donating (–NCS) groups seem to localize the HOMO on their side. This is very evident in the structures (2) and (5) containing (–NCS) groups donor moieties. Fig. 11 also shows the HOMO and LUMO levels for the novel ruthenium complex analogues. The analogues (3) and (4) have smaller HOMO–LUMO gaps compared with the other complexes, with a difference of approximately 0.12–0.32 eV.
The results of the calculations revealed that the HOMO and LUMO values of both the analogues (3) and (4) are roughly the half HOMO and LUMO values of the structures (2) and (5), as shown in Fig. 11. It also shows a trend in the combination of donor moieties with that of the acceptor moieties: if both have small HOMO–LUMO gaps, the donor–acceptor moieties would be more likely to have small HOMO–LUMO gaps. This trend is clearly observed in the donor moieties of structures (2) and (5) and the structure (3) acceptor moiety, which has the lowest gap among the moieties studied.
3.4 DSSC measurements
The photovoltaic performances of Ru (1–5) measured under identical conditions are summarized in Table 3. Fig. 12 shows comparison of the J–V measurement results of complexes (1–5) used in the solar cells. Complex (2) showed the highest short circuit current and fill factor among the dyes. Spectral characteristics of the investigated dyes are similar. It is clear from the data that dye (2) is the most efficient sensitizer of the all dyes. Indeed, the efficiencies of the DSSCs prepared with classical type Ru(bpy)(SCN)2(L), in which (L) is bearing sulfonyl acid, are significantly (i.e. 10 times) higher than those of the non-classical dyes. The Jsc value increased in the following order: (2) > (5) > (1) > (4) > (3).

Two SCN substituents yielded a higher Jsc for the cell than the tris ligand (L) substituent. This indicates that the addition of NCS ligands influences the cell performance. The effect of anchoring group number on the performance of a DSSC is critical in achieving high efficiency. Hara et al. found that a monocarboxylate Ru–phen complex was less efficient than that obtained using di- or tricarboxylate.53,54
Yang et al. found that in triphenylamine-based, multiple rhodanine-3-acetic acid electron acceptor dyes, those which contained two anchor groups (rhodanine-3-acetic acid) exhibited superior photovoltaic performance over those with one or three anchor groups, owing to red shifts and broadening of absorbance.55 H. Shang et al. indicated the more anchoring groups the dye has, the lower efficiency the device exhibits.56 Here, the efficiencies of the DSSCs are susceptible to changing the number of anchoring groups/sulfonyl groups in the dyes. Increasing the anchor group number resulted in lower short-circuit current and lower efficiency. Dye (2) showed the highest Jsc value compared to the other dyes for three main reasons: the dye solution of a complex with more sulfonyl groups may contain hydrogen-bonded aggregates on the surface that prevent penetration into the small pores of the TiO2 surface. Besides the hydrogen-bonded aggregates, the orientation of adsorbed sensitizer on the surface may also be responsible for lower surface concentration of the dye. The other possible explanation is that the rate of regeneration of dyes with more anchoring groups with I−/I3− is slower than with complex (2) since the presence of NCS groups on complex (2) accelerates the regeneration.57 This will directly impact the number of electrons being injected, which will consequently influence the Jsc. Another reason that compounds (1), (3) and (4) fail in our aim is they have no dye regeneration process as their HUMO energies lie high above the redox level of electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 12, the best energy level alignment among HOMO–LUMO of dye, electrolyte and conduction band of TiO2 occurred for dyes (2) and (5). It is very important to note that when one of the bidentate ligands of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ is replaced by two NCS ligands, the lower symmetry of the complex compromises the degeneracy of the MLCT transitions to lead to a broader absorption band.58 The installation of the two NCS ligands also raises the energy of the HOMO, resulting in a bathochromic shift of the low-energy MLCT band.59

Fig. 13 shows the operating principles and energy level diagram of a dye-sensitized solar cell for complexes (1–5). FT-IR spectroscopy has been shown to be a powerful tool for extracting structural information about the molecules adsorbed onto a TiO2 surface. Fig. 14 shows FT-IR spectra of ruthenium complex (1) and ruthenium complex (1) adsorbed on a TiO2 film. The region of particular interest is between 1000 and 1300 cm−1, as the various S–O stretching bands that are found here indicate the types of S–O bonding that are present in the molecule.

 Fig. 14  FT-IR spectra of ruthenium complex (1) (red line) and ruthenium complex (1) adsorbed on TiO2 films (black line). Inset: TiO2-anatase nanostructures extended along the [101] directions sensitized by dye (1). 
This region is complicated, with vibrations of the bpy and aryl ring framework all contributing to the spectra. There are a number of bands at lower energy (to 1000 cm−1) in dyes and dyes anchored to TiO2 which contain both C–C and C–N stretching, S–O stretching and SO3 deformation character.
The other prominent band at 500 cm−1 in anchored Ru onto TiO2 is due to the (Ti–O) stretching band of the TiO2 surface. For all dyes adsorbed on TiO2, there is an intense, broad band in the region 1200–1300 cm−1 (overlapping the highest bpy band), which is assigned to the anti-symmetric stretch of –SO3−, where the negative charge is delocalized to give two equivalent (or nearly so) S–O bonds. There is a high-energy tail to the band indicating some variation in this bonding. The other intense band in this spectrum at 1050–1150 cm−1 is assigned as the symmetric stretch of –SO3−, since it is not assignable to the polypyridine ligands.61–63 The difference between νas(SO3) and νs(SO3) (Δν), compared to the corresponding values in ionic (94 nm), is currently employed to determine the corresponding mode of the sulfonat group. The possible binding modes for ruthenium polypyridine containing sulfonato group on a TiO2 surface are shown in Fig. 15.
 Fig. 15  Possible coordination modes for sulfonate anions in the TiO2 solid state. 
(1) The unidentate coordination of the sulfonato group removes the equivalence of the three oxygen atoms, resulting in ester type bond formation between the sulfonato group and the TiO2 surface. Unidentate complexes (Fig. 15 (1)) exhibit Δν values [νas(SO3−) − νs(SO3−)] that are much greater than the ionic complexes. (2) Chelating complexes (Fig. 15 (2)) exhibit Δν values that are significantly less than the ionic values. (3) The Δν values for bridging complexes (Fig. 15 (3)) are greater than those of chelating complexes, and close to the ionic values. On the basis of the FT-IR measurements, the difference between the νas(SO3−) and νs(SO3−) in the Ru complexes (90–100 cm−1) and the adsorbed Ru complexes (85–110 cm−1) suggest that the sulfonato groups are bound to the TiO2 surface via chelating mode (2).
The action spectrum, incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) as a function of wavelength, was measured to evaluate the photoresponse of the photoelectrode in the whole spectral region. Fig. 16 shows the IPCE spectra of DSSCs based on dyes (1–5). All five dyes can convert visible light to photocurrent in the range of 400–700 nm. In the range of 400–500 nm, IPCE maxima of up to 7%, 23%, 2%, 5%, 9% were achieved for dyes (1–5), respectively. Dye (2) gave broader spectra and higher photoresponse in the long wavelength region (>500 nm) than other dyes, which was consistent with the corresponding absorption spectra on transparent TiO2 film.
 Fig. 16  Photocurrent action spectra of nanocrystalline TiO2 films sensitized by complexes (1–5). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency is plotted as a function of wavelength. 
According to the photocurrent action spectra, one may expect higher short-circuit photocurrent densities (Jsc) for dye (2)-based DSSCs from the overlap integral of IPCE curves with the standard AM 1.5 solar emission spectrum. Indeed, dye (2)-based DSSCs give higher Jsc (2.46 mA cm−2) than other samples (see Fig. 16 and Table 3), which is consistent with the IPCE data. The sensitizer with more sulforic acid anchoring groups upon adsorption transfers more protons to the TiO2 surface, leading to the positive shift of the conduction band edge of TiO2.
Thus, the increasing of the sulforic acid anchoring groups could lead to increased charge recombination at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface and lower efficiency.64
Further work on ruthenium complexes with other polypyridine ligands is in progress, and we believe that improvement can be accomplished by a thorough replacement of the attached functionalized groups to the ruthenium complexes in both DSSC and OLED fields.
4. Conclusions
Synthesis of new heteroleptic and homoleptic ruthenium(II) complexes with π-extended phenanthroline sulfonate derivates and their application in both light emitting diodes and dye-sensitized solar cells have been reported. This is interesting because the working mechanism of the above two devices is nearly inversed. We obtained better efficiency for both DSSCs and OLEDs prepared with dye (2) in comparison to those with other dyes under standard conditions. Increased electron injection is reflected in the increased short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) and overall efficiency. DSSC and OLED studies reveal that ruthenium polypyridine with the NCS ligand exhibits better current generating capacity than the ruthenium polypyridine without NCS groups. DFT calculations also show that complexes (2) and (5) have (–NCS) groups in their structure, which caused the localization of the LUMO in the acceptor region. The EL spectra of ruthenium complexes show a long red shift in visible region related to PVK:PBD blend. This characteristic, together with favorable electronic and redox properties as demonstrated by DFT calculation, optical and electrochemical studies, make Ru(L)(bpy)(SCN)2 (2) where (L) = 6-one-[1,10]phenanthrolin-5-ylamino)-3-hydroxynaphthalene-1-sulfonic attractive for further photoelectric applications. To our knowledge, this class of dyes has not been previously reported, and this finding opens a pathway to designing dyes that both absorb visible light for energy conversion of solar to electricity and light emission by further modification of the ligand architecture, which will improve notably power conversion efficiencies of dye-sensitized solar cells and efficient light emission diodes.
