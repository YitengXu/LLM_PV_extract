    , Accepted 22nd March 2019First published on 25th March 2019AbstractA novel galvanic device for energy storage via an electrochemical homogeneous catalytic reaction is developed within this work. It is based on two redox electrochemical reactions, one of which acts as the positive electrode reaction and the other works in a sacrificial manner. These two equal-sized electrodes sit opposite each other between a cast polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) gasket channel. This totally membrane-free, electrochemical device functions as a redox flow cell, with significant potential application in the energy harvesting field. Its features include design simplicity, geographical flexibility and high power efficiency. The voltage efficiency was improved by ca. 3% under rapid flow conditions. Furthermore, a sulphurous reactant (in this work L-cysteine) is employed to enhance the energy storage ability through an electrocatalytic mechanism. The energy storage capacity of the cell was lifted by ca. 27% via the electrocatalytic reaction.
1. Introduction
Noting the increasingly explosive thirst of portable power sources from the end-user as well as wireless sensor networks, energy harvesting in personalized devices has been motivated by a burgeoning demand for clean and sustainable energy.1 This has, in turn, enabled robust development of cutting-edge materials as well as conversion of mechanical energy, solar energy, bio energy and waste heat to electricity etc. since all these technologies reduce resource depletion and environmental pollution.2–8 However, load leveling plays a crucial role when these energy harvesting resources are to be utilized on a very large scale.9,10 Therefore, to be consumed by the end-user in electrical form effectively, redox flow batteries (RFBs) are still functioning as renewable energy storage devices because they offer a relatively constant electricity output compared with many types of renewable energy which are to some extent intermittent and unpredictable during ever changing weather conditions, whilst they are free from many geographical restrictions including underground installation and electric vehicles.11
As one of the most robust electrochemical systems associated with energy storage and conversion, RFBs represent those devices that contain an ion exchange membrane between two separated electrolytes on positive and negative electrodes, respectively, where the electrochemical redox reactions occur continuously to collect renewable energy or offer stabilized output of electrical energy.12 Several main redox couples including vanadium/bromine, iron/chromium, Fe-ETDA/bromine, all vanadium, zinc/cerium etc. have been considered to play the key roles within RFBs.13–15 Also, comprehensive studies had been done with non-aqueous flow batteries due to their non-corrosive electrolytes and relatively wider electrochemical stability windows compared with water.15,16p-Phenylenediamine-based organic redox couples,16N-ferrocenylphthalimide,17 ferrocene/TEMPO and cobaltocenium hexafluorophosphate/N-methylphthalimide18 were all considered as promising redox couples in non-aqueous flow batteries. Besides, as one of the most successful and well-developed RFBs, vanadium redox flow batteries (VRBs) are capable of a current density of 50–80 mA cm−2 and a power density ca. 0.1 W cm−2.19 Substantial investigations have been carried out with novel cell designs and efficient materials.20–22 For instance, Mench et al. reported a design optimization study of a VRB and achieved an additional 30% of discharge capacity.23 Also, Ressel et al. designed a tubular VRB possessing a maximum current density of 70 mA cm−2 and power density of 142 W l−1.24
There has been significant interest in the study of miniaturized energy storage devices due to the development of distributed energy systems.25,26 One of the most prominent characteristics of such devices is the scale-up strategy via a process of multiplying the number of units produced.27 Miniaturized energy storage devices including miniaturized microbial fuel cells,28–30 microfluidic galvanic cells,31 and microfluidic fuel cells32,33 have been comprehensively investigated. The combination of such devices facilitates the energy harvesting activities of distributed renewable energy e.g. hydro, wind and solar resources.25 Lacina et al. applied an extra pair of electrodes to enhance the performance of a galvanic cell in a miniaturized electrochemical device.34 Although having the benefit of the utilization of the same metal ions in both electrolytes, an ion exchange membrane is still necessary in flow batteries, which decreases the battery energy efficiency via energy consuming ion transfer across the membrane.35 With all these considerations, a flow battery based on the Pb2+/Pb and PbO2/Pb2+ couples without the requirement of a membrane is demonstrated.36–44 This kind of design decreases the device complexity and cost and improves the mass transfer between the two electrodes, which achieves a coulombic efficiency above 85% and an energy efficiency of approximately 65%.37
To improve the performance of the miniaturized energy storage device mentioned in this work, the use of an electrocatalytic (EC′) mechanism is explained. For the one electron transfer redox process, a high chemical stability guarantees the electron transfer reaction occurs and only occurs between these two species. However, in many cases, the above reaction is coupled to homogenous reactions.45 Among all these pathways, the EC′ reaction is attractive in energy storage applications due to the regeneration of the original reactant.46–48
The definition of EC′ is R(aq) – e− ↔ O(aq)(1) O(aq) + S(aq) → R(aq) + Y(aq)(2)
Electrochemical techniques including cyclic voltammetry,49 differential pulse voltammetry50 and single-potential amperometry51 are widely employed to obtain kinetic and thermodynamic information on the EC′ reaction. Besides, in order to improve the sensitivity and simplicity, the EC′ mechanism is further studied at a variety of substrates such as boron doped diamond,49,51,52 glassy carbon46,53,54 and modified carbon paste electrodes.50,55 Moreover, it is believed the catalytic reaction is sensitive to the flow rate and the concentrations of both the mediator and reactant,56 whilst the kinetics of the coupled homogenous chemical reactions could be validated via flow devices,52 which in addition offer many attractive and versatile applications in industry, especially in redox flow battery systems. Redox mediated flow battery was an active example of these applications.57
Also, one attractive phenomenon associated with the EC′ reaction is that under conditions of fast homogeneous kinetics as well as initially similar concentrations of species ‘R’ and species ‘S’, the cyclic voltammogram shows two separated waves during the forward scan.48,53,54 As previously reported, a split wave of the EC′ reaction is simulatively achieved via a channel electrode and a hemispherical particle electrode as well as their arrays.58,59
In the present work, a simply designed flow battery without a membrane employing the EC′ mechanism is demonstrated. The positive reaction coupled with homogeneous catalytic reactions occurs on a glassy carbon rod electrode on one side of a manually cast polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) gasket, whilst on the other side, the negative reaction takes place on a zinc rod to work in a sacrificial manner. The resulting smart energy storage demonstrates favourable rechargeable characteristics as well as a potential ability for use in modified energy storage devices.
2. Experimental
2.1 Reagents
Zinc chloride, disodium tetraborate, potassium chloride, hydrochloric acid and phosphoric acid were all purchased from Fuchen Chemical Reagents Co. (Tianjin, China) with the exception of 1,1′-ferrocenedicarboxylic acid (FDA) and L-cysteine, which were supplied by Tokyo Chemical Industry, and used in this work without further purification. All solutions and subsequent dilutions were prepared using deionized water from a HUIYIPU UHQ grade water system (Beijing, China) with a resistivity of not less than 18.25 MΩ cm. Fc(II) and Zn(II) in pH 7 buffer were prepared by stirring ferrocenedicarboxylic acid and ZnCl2 in a pH 9 disodium tetraborate (0.05 M) buffer and titrating hydrochloric acid to pH 7 with 0.1 M potassium chloride as the electrolyte. All the solutions were degassed for one hour prior to the experiment and L-cysteine was mixed with the above solution shortly before each test. Polydimethylsiloxane (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning) was purchased for the construction of the flow channel. Gamma alumina powder (Gaoss Union, Tianjin, China) was applied for polishing to decrease the particle size from 1 μm to 0.05 μm on the glassy carbon and zinc electrodes before the test.
2.2 Apparatus
All the electrochemical measurements were recorded using an electrochemical analyzer (CHI760E, Shanghai, China). The glassy carbon rod electrode (d = 3 mm), platinum net electrode (2.0 cm × 2.0 cm) and Ag/AgCl reference electrode were all purchased from Tianjin Aidahengsheng Technology Co., Ltd. The simply designed flow redox cell comprised two equal-sized electrodes which were polished by the alumina powder. One glassy carbon rod electrode (diameter = 5 mm, Gaoss Union, Tianjin, China) sealed in a 10 mm thick polymethyl methacrylate chip (60 mm × 40 mm) acted as the cathode and one zinc rod electrode (diameter = 5 mm, Gaoss Union, Tianjin, China) sealed in the same manner provided the anode electrode. Between these two electrodes, a manually cast PDMS gasket with a 45.0 × 5.0 × 1.0 mm gasket was prepared to act as the flow channel. The cell was assembled with six screws (diameter = 6 mm) and two silicon tubes (diameter = 1 mm) were connected to function as the inlet and the outlet respectively. The electrical connection to both electrodes was made via 8 mm-wide copper tape. In order to achieve the required volume flow rate, the flow cell experiment was conducted using a LSP02-1B push–pull syringe pump (Baoding Longer Precision Pump Co., Ltd). The schematic diagram of the device and whole test system is given in Fig. 1.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Galvanostatic behaviour of the simply designed galvanic cell with an electrochemical reaction
Owing to the relatively stable performance of zinc as a sacrificial electrode to increase the cell electromotive force (emf), a zinc rod was utilised to act as the anode electrode. Thus the cell is functioning based on the following processes:Charge: positive electrode: FDA(aq) − e− ↔ FDA+(aq)Negative electrode: ½Zn2+(aq) + e− ↔ ½ZnDischarge: positive electrode: FDA+(aq) + e− ↔ FDA(aq)Negative electrode: ½Zn − e− ↔ ½Zn2+(aq)Overall: 2FDA(aq) + Zn2+(aq) ↔ 2FDA+(aq) + Zn,creating an open circuit voltage of 1.15 ± 0.03 V. For the above system, when only the mass of electroactive species (FDA: 274.05 g mol−1; Zn: 65.4 g mol−1) is considered, the theoretical specific capacity is 78.96 mA h g−1, which is competitive compared with other types of electrochemical energy storage couples.60

Fig. 2(a–c) show the galvanostatic responses corresponding to a constant charge current density of 5.10 μA cm−2 whilst different discharge current densities ranging from 0.51 nA cm−2 to 25.48 μA cm−2 at different flow rates were recorded. In Fig. 2(a), it is clear that the charging voltage (1.42 ± 0.02 V) is related to that expected from the hydrostatic cyclic voltammetry obtained within the cell (Fig. 2(d)). During the whole charging process the voltage remained stable since the current density applied here was relatively small, which gave the system enough time to satisfy this constant charging current. Consequently a constant capacity of 0.028 μA h was achieved within the same redox reaction in the cell. The curve of the discharge part is defined following the regimes below: (1) the voltage drops dramatically due to capacitative discharge just after the start of the discharge process immediately; (2) rapid drops following capacitative discharge are observed with higher discharge current densities (10.19–25.48 μA cm−2) corresponding to Ohmic losses; and (3) the voltage plateaus at ∼1.30 V after which a higher discharge current appears due to the exhaustive consumption of electroactive species near the electrode. Discharge of the corresponding cell to 1.20 V did not lead to a significant decrease in capacity (3.72 nA h with a discharge current density of 5.10 μA cm−2), which resulted in voltage efficiencies (the ratio of the discharge and the charge voltage in the same cycle) of 84.54 ± 1.17% and power efficiencies (the ratio of the discharge and the charge power in the same cycle) of 96.49% during the same state of the charge and discharge current density (5.10 μA cm−2).

It is notable that the cell capacity is ca. 1.05 μA h, which is much bigger than the charging capacity, meaning only 2.64% of the device has been charged. Also, compared with the charge capacity, only a fraction of the solution within the channel is discharged. The explanations for the above observations are: (1) the diffusion of reactants is relatively slow compared to the rate of electron transfer at both the positive and negative electrodes, which causes the unexpected increase and decrease of the voltage after lengthy times of charge and discharge respectively; and (2) when the cell is discharged, the readily-charged chemicals diffuse to the bulk solution within the cell channel, which leads to a loss of power and energy during the discharge process. This issue may be solved via microfabrication methodology by manufacturing a thin flow channel down to the micrometer level. The electrochemical microreactor has been utilized as a robust sensing technique in analytical chemistry.61 Enhanced mass transfer via a precise fabrication methodology would be the next stage of the above galvanic device. When the solution containing redox couples flows within the galvanic device, the galvanostatic responses are illustrated in Fig. 2(b and c). The fluctuation of the charge profiles was smaller with the increase of the flow rate due to the constantly stable mass transfer provided by the flowing solutions within the device. Different from the similar charge profiles observed under both stagnant and flow conditions, the discharge profile varied with the increased flow rate, especially with the relatively high discharge current density. A thinner discharge profile was observed with the increase of the flow rate. For instance, it took 13.4 seconds for the discharge voltage to reach 1.2 V when there was no flow at a current density of 5.10 μA cm−2. This number went down to 9.1 seconds and 3.5 seconds at a flow rate of 0.1 mL min−1 and 0.5 mL min−1 respectively.
Noting that the galvanic cell works properly with the selected redox reaction, Ragone plots were introduced to illustrate the cell performance (Fig. 3).62 The energy densities are estimated by the discharge curve between 1.45 V and 1.20 V with the average power densities being obtained through the normalization of the energy densities by the discharge time. In order to achieve the specific energy and power densities for this galvanic cell system, only the mass of electroactive species (13.32 μg) between the two equal-sized electrodes involved in the redox reactions is considered.63 Note that the stripping of zinc is ignored since the Zn/Zn2+ couple is not the limiting condition for the cell. The data show lower energy densities within the region where the power density is smaller than 10 W kg−1, but demonstrate a stable energy storage ability (above 0.38 W h kg−1) with a power density of at least 100 W kg−1. Furthermore, considering only a fraction of redox reactants have engaged in the reaction, it is reasonable to normalize the electroactive mass within a thin layer equal to the Nernst diffusion length, viz. l = 2(πDτ)0.5, where τ = 100 s, and D = 9.73 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 (data obtained from a standard three-electrode system via cyclic voltammetry), where electroporation occurs in the presence of an electrical field. This normalization increases the energy density to 0.15 W h kg−1 and power density to 2.60 × 102 W kg−1 (discharge current density of 12.74 μA cm−2), which makes the galvanic cell attractive and useful as a power source for portable devices. As discussed previously, a possible way to achieve a high power density as well as energy density is to manufacture a micro-feature device to enhance the mass transfer within the flow channel. One interesting feature is the sharp decrease of the energy density in the Ragone plot when there is no flow. The energy density decreased gradually after a steady output zone (0.37 ± 0.10 W h kg−1) until a dramatic decrease appeared, which made the energy density even lower than the energy density obtained under flow conditions. This could be rationalized by the constant supply of reactants by a relatively small flow rate. Under such conditions, the complementary FDA could partly add to the obtained energy via the galvanic device. However, when the flow rate reached a higher level (in this study 0.2 mL min−1), the energy density was reduced due to the rapid flow of FDA+ downstream.

Fig. 4a shows the charge/discharge curve with 5 cycles obtained with the same experimental parameters when the cell is charged for 20 s at a constant current density ranging from 5.10 μA cm−2 to 254.78 μA cm−2 and discharged immediately at the same value. Good reversibility of redox couples is observed, especially when the charge voltage is optimized at ∼1.45 V. Fig. 4b shows the charge part in the third charge/discharge cycle. As anticipated, the curve shows a reduced voltage value at the smallest current density whilst a moderate discharge plateau is observed. When the current density range rises up to 101.91 μA cm−2, the charge voltage reaches a stable level, followed by a shoulder-shape charge voltage at ∼1.50 V with a significant increase to ∼2.30 V. Correspondingly, the discharging of the cell becomes more rapid with the increase of the current density.64 When the system forces even more electrons to pass though the electrodes, the redox reaction happens very rapidly and cannot satisfy the electron transfer of the external circuit required, leading to the reduction of the electrolyte. Consequently, a stable level of charge voltage which guarantees the desired redox reactions occur within the cell is crucial for the galvanic cell. For this particular charge/discharge time, unlike the high current analysis, 101.91 μA cm−2 is the highest current density which enables the cell to be charged most, whilst the voltage results do not enter the reverse polarity region. Note that with a longer charge/discharge time, the desirable current density will be smaller due to the constant consumption of redox reactants.

Electrolyte: 2 mM FDA and 2 mM ZnCl2 in pH 7 buffer. (a) 5 full cycles of the galvanostatic response. (b) Zoom-in view of the third charge cycle. 
Following the above results, the performance under flow conditions was examined. It is clear from the data in Fig. 5a and b that, as expected, as the flow rate increases from 0.01 to 1.0 mL min−1, the charge voltage decreases significantly, giving a voltage efficiency increased by ca. 3% (comparison between 1.0 mL min−1 and 0.01 mL min−1), whilst a reduced discharge profile is observed. The explanation is below: (1) as the diffusion layer thickness decreases with the flow rate, it is evident that the enhanced flux containing reactant brought by the forced convention along the channel satisfies the constant electrons required from the system, giving a reduced charge profile. (2) It is notable the system under this particular flow condition does not give an enhanced discharge profile because the quicker the flow rate is, the more charged solution is forced to go through the channel. Although the cell proves to give higher voltage efficiency, it is predictable that the energy density will be reduced dramatically as (a) a thinner discharge profile is demonstrated and (b) more reactants are flowing through the cell. To modify this work, a possible way is to pump the charged solution in a reverse way, which forces the charged reactants to go back to the electrode and discharge, and then reverse the flow direction again, to recycle the solution. Another favorable method is to include additional electrodes downstream, which act as discharge electrodes, functioning when the charged reactants flow through them.

3.2 Galvanostatic behaviour of FDA and L-cysteine with various charge/discharge currents: an energy storage enhancement
In this work, ferrocenedicarboxylic acid (FDA) is used as the mediator due to its superior behaviour in stagnant cyclic voltammetry, square wave voltammetry and large amplitude Fourier transform alternating current voltammetry, which demonstrates the split wave of the electrocatalytic mechanism. When the electrocatalytic (EC′) reaction is introduced into the galvanic cell, the positive electrode reaction becomesCharge: FDA(aq) – e− ↔ FDA+(aq)FDA+(aq) + L-cysteine(aq) → FDA(aq) + L-cystine(aq)Discharge: FDA+(aq) + e− ↔ FDA(aq)FDA+(aq) + L-cysteine(aq) → FDA(aq) + L-cystine(aq)where the charge capacity is enhanced by the regenerated FDA through the chemical reaction, whilst a certain amount of depletion in the discharge reactant is produced by the same reaction along with the galvanic device as illustrated in Fig. 6(a). In order to optimize the performance with the EC′ mechanism, as noted earlier, a split wave is introduced as shown in Fig. 6(b). When no L-cysteine is added, a standard quasi-reversible redox reaction behavior was demonstrated (ΔE = 62 mV). As L-cysteine was introduced into the solution, both peaks increased with the increase of the L-cysteine concentration. The pre-wave demonstrated a linear fit with the increase of the L-cysteine concentration (Iprepeak/A = 2.278 × 10−6 [concentration of L-cysteine/mM] + 2.309 × 10−7, N = 6, R = 0.993) as shown in Fig. 6(c). The second peak produced by the oxidation of FDA gave a linear fit as well (Isecondpeak/A = 1.537 × 10−6 [concentration of L-cysteine/mM] + 8.361 × 10−8, N = 6, R = 0.986). Compared with a typical EC′ mechanism response with L-cysteine, the total catalysis regime enables a quick cycle of FDA, providing an increased integrated current. Indeed, for the discharge profile, L-cysteine is involved in a depletion of the charged reactant on the positive electrode, which is undesirable in the system. The second reason why the total catalysis regime is chosen here is that a limited amount of L-cysteine, in this work similar to that of FDA, is added to guarantee FDA is involved in the redox reaction during the discharge analysis.

(c) Linear fit of the pre-wave peak current of the cyclic voltammograms in (b). 
The galvanic device under the electrocatalytic (EC′) reaction with stagnant and flow conditions is illustrated in Fig. 7 and 8 respectively. In order to depict the influence of the EC′ mechanism clearly, a stop point of a charge time as long as 4000 s or a potential beyond 2.00 V and a discharge time of 4000 s or a potential below 0.5 V under a small current drain (50.96 μA cm−2, corresponding to a low load) are applied within the cell (Fig. 7(a)). This condition enables the cell to work with the redox couple required for the EC′ mechanism. As shown in Fig. 7(b), after normalization of the cell capacity, the electrocatalytic reaction enhances the charge capacity with a higher addition of L-cysteine, which is utilized to regenerate more FDA within the channel. Consequently, a larger cell capacity is obtained and it is evident that the more L-cysteine introduced to the system, the larger the cell capacity achieved. However, not all of the FDA+ generated from the FDA by the chemical reaction will be involved in the redox reaction when the cell is discharged because meanwhile a chemical reaction occurs to consume the total amount of FDA+. The evidence of this phenomenon is in Fig. 7c, where the discharge profile is getting thinner with the increase of L-cysteine. When the cell is under flow conditions, the charge/discharge profile is shown in Fig. 8. In contrast with the stagnant situation, increasing L-cysteine addition produces a significant enhancement of the energy capacity under the same L-cysteine concentration (Fig. 8b), which promotes the charge voltage up to 2.0 V even more slowly compared with the stagnant condition. The total catalytic regime of the EC′ mechanism contributes to this enhanced energy storage capacity because the quickly regenerated FDA undergoes more electron transfer within a fixed time scale, which makes the energy storage capacity increase by ca. 27% (2 mM L-cysteine in Fig. 8b). However, it should be stressed that the discharge profile shown in Fig. 8c does not have a similar capacity to the stagnant situation, which means the flow rate is quick enough to bring fresh uncharged solution to the electrode, proving the charged solution in the system (1) flows downstream so quick that no discharge profile could be observed; and (2) diffuses to the bulk solution as earlier noted. Considering this merely unoptimized system, the specifications obtained from the performance of this galvanic device could still be improved. As mentioned previously, separated charge/discharge electrodes are a scenario to be considered to avoid the conflict of the charge/discharge procedure.

4. Conclusions
In this work, the performance of a galvanic device with one redox couple and a sacrificial negative electrode applying the EC′ mechanism has been examined. Various current densities are utilized to illustrate the states of the cell: low battery drain rates result in obvious charge/discharge profiles, which is entirely in line with expectations. Furthermore, a forced convection is introduced to the system, which compresses the diffusion layer thickness and therefore enhances the mass transfer within the cell channel. The rapid flow results in the voltage efficiency being increased by ca. 3% compared with the low flow rate data. The Ragone plot is employed to evaluate the cell performance in terms of the energy and the power density. The corresponding device works as a mid-range electrochemical capacitor after normalization of the working electroactive species within the cell. When the coupled chemical reaction with a relatively large rate constant is introduced, a split wave is achieved in the cyclic voltammograms. An enhancement of the energy storage capacity is observed (by ca. 27% at 2 mM L-cysteine). The electrocatalytic mechanism significantly changes the charge–discharge properties of the studied devices. Further investigations are required to solve the decreased discharge capacity, e.g. dual electrode pair installation and reverse flow operation conditions.
