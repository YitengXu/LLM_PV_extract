    , Accepted 3rd January 2017First published on 5th January 2017AbstractTwo new quinoxaline-based D–A–π–A organic sensitizers AQ309 and AQ310 have been designed and synthesized employing 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) and cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) as π-linker units, respectively. The new AQ309 and AQ310 dyes have been applied in all-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (ssDSSCs). An impressive record photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.0% for AQ310-based ssDSSCs using Spiro-OMeTAD as the hole transport material (HTM) was obtained under standard AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2) solar intensity. This clearly outperforms the PCE of the state-of-the-art organic D–π–A dye LEG4-based devices showing a PCE of 7.3% under the same conditions. Moreover, an excellent high PCE of 8.6% was also recorded for AQ310-based devices under 50% solar intensity. Meanwhile, the AQ310-based ssDSSCs showed a much longer electron lifetime according to the transient photovoltage decay measurement, demonstrating lower charge recombination losses in the devices. Photo-induced absorption spectroscopy (PIA) indicated that AQ310 could be more efficiently regenerated by Spiro-OMeTAD. These results show that molecular engineering is a promising strategy to develop D–A–π–A organic sensitizers for highly efficient ssDSSCs.
1. Introduction
A large number of thin-film photovoltaic materials have been developed, such as perovskites,1–3 organic small molecules/polymers,4–6 and quantum dots.7,8 and efficiencies well over 10% have been achieved during the last few years However, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) still play an important role in the strive towards the next generation solar technology due to low toxicity materials, facile production, and high performance-to-price.9–12 Recently, a new record efficiency of 14.5% was reported by using a cobalt-based liquid electrolyte and a co-sensitization strategy.13 However, liquid electrolytes suffer from the risk of leakage and corrosion of metal-based counter electrode materials, which significantly limits the DSSC competitiveness for large-scale application.14,15
In an effort to promote DSSCs to become truly one of the most promising photovoltaic technologies for solar energy conversion, the best solution is to replace the liquid electrolyte with solid-state hole-transport materials (HTMs). So far, the record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.7% for solid-state DSSCs (ssDSSCs) has been obtained using the organic D–π–A dye LEG4 (Scheme 1) as the photosensitizer and 1,1,2,2-tetracholoroethane-doped 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)9,9′-spiro-bifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) (Fig. S1, ESI†) as the HTM. This is considerably lower than the PCEs shown for liquid electrolyte-based DSSCs.16 This limitation is mainly attributed to the insufficient light-harvesting capacities and fast charge recombination in the ssDSSC devices leading to a lower photocurrent and photovoltage.17,18 Besides, the thickness of TiO2 films in ssDSSCs is limited to around 2.2 μm because of the poor pore filling of HTMs into the mesoporous TiO2 films.19,20 Accordingly, the development of rationally designed sensitizers with high molar extinction coefficients and broad absorption spectra is desirable to improve the PCE of ssDSSCs.
 Scheme 1  The chemical structures of LEG4, AQ309 and AQ310. 
Being one of the key components for light harvesting, thousands of new sensitizers have been designed and synthesized for DSSCs during the last 20 years.21,22 It is noteworthy that organic sensitizers containing a D–A–π–A configuration have drawn special attention, in which quinoxaline plays the role of an auxiliary acceptor improving the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process for more efficient light absorption.23–25 In addition, the introduction of bulky donors with long alkoxy chains represents one of the most promising approaches expected to suppress dye molecular aggregation preventing charge recombination at the photoelectrode.26,27 Most importantly, so far no quinoxaline-based organic D–A–π–A dyes have been investigated in ssDSSCs until now.
In this study, we have designed and synthesized two new quinoxaline-based D–A–π–A type organic sensitizers (AQ309 and AQ310), employing 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) and cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) as the π-linker units, respectively (Scheme 1). Devices containing AQ310 showed a record PCE of 8.0% under one sun illumination, which exceeds the efficiency (7.3%) of devices based on the standard red dye LEG4 or the reference dye AQ309 (6.8%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case where an organic D–A–π–A dye offers a PCE of 8.0% in ssDSSCs. Consequently, this work provides a feasible strategy of molecular engineering to develop new D–A–π–A organic dyes for highly efficient ssDSSCs.

2.10. Instruments

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were measured at 400 and 100 MHz, respectively. Chemical shifts, δ, were calibrated against TMS as an internal standard. HRMS measurements were performed by using a Waters LCT Premier XE spectrometer. The absorption spectra of the sensitizer dyes in solution and adsorbed on TiO2 films were measured with a Varian Cary 500 spectrophotometer. Fluorescence spectra were measured with a Horiba Fluoromax-4 fluorescence spectrometer. The cyclic voltammograms were determined by using a CHI660E electrochemical workstation (Chenhua Co. Ltd, Shanghai, China) in a three-electrode cell. The working electrode was a glassy carbon electrode, used in conjunction with a Pt auxiliary electrode and an Ag/AgCl wire reference electrode. The electrolyte consisted of 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) solution in dichloromethane containing 10−3 M of the dye. The Fc/Fc+ redox couple was used as an external potential reference. The scan rate was 50 mV s−1.
2.11. Device fabrication
According to the previously reported literature,2 fluorine-doped tin-oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates (Pilkington TEC15) were patterned by etching with zinc powder and 2 M hydrochloric acid. The substrates were carefully cleaned in ultrasonic baths of detergents, deionized water, acetone and ethanol successively. The remaining organic residues were removed for 10 min by using an airbrush. A compact TiO2 blocking layer was deposited onto the surface of a pre-cleaned FTO substrate by spray pyrolysis on a hotplate at 450 °C using an airbrush. The solution used in the spray pyrolysis was 0.2 M Ti-isopropoxide, 2 M acetylacetone in isopropanol. In all electrode preparations, 10 spray cycles were used as the standard parameter. Nanoporous TiO2 films were coated on the compact TiO2 layer by screen printing of a diluted TiO2 paste (Dyesol DSL 18NR-T) with terpineol (2:1, mass ratio). The thickness of the film is ca. 2.2 μm, as measured with a DekTak profilometer. After sintering the TiO2 film on a hotplate at 500 °C for 30 min, the film was cooled to room temperature and immersed in 0.02 M aqueous TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 min. The film was then rinsed with deionized water and then annealed on a hotplate at 500 °C for 30 min. After cooling to 90 °C, the film was immersed for 3 h in 0.1 mM solution (tert-butanol:acetonitrile = 1:1) of AQ309, AQ310 and LEG4, and then the sensitized electrodes were rinsed with ethanol and dried. Subsequently, the HTM solutions were prepared by dissolving the Spiro-OMeTAD in chlorobenzene at a concentration of 150 mM, with addition of LiTFSI (20 mM, from a stock solution in acetonitrile with a concentration of 0.5 M), t-BP (200 mM, from a stock solution in chlorobenzene with a concentration of 1.0 M) and 4% 1,1,2,2-tetracholoroethane (TeCA) solvent (volume ratio relative to chlorobenzene). The Spiro-OMeTAD solution was left on the sensitized electrode for 30 s and then followed by spin-coating for 30 s with 2000 rpm. All of the Spiro-OMeTAD solutions were prepared in a glovebox under a nitrogen atmosphere; chlorobenzene and acetonitrile were deaerated by bubbling with dry nitrogen for half hours before introducing into the glovebox environment. The Spiro-OMeTAD solution was stored in the glovebox for aging overnight before use. Subsequently, a 200 nm thick Ag back contact was deposited onto the organic semiconductor by thermal evaporation in a vacuum chamber with a base pressure of about 10−6 bar, to complete the device fabrication.
2.12. Device characterization
Current–voltage characteristics were recorded by applying an external potential bias to the cell while recording the generated photocurrent with a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter. The light source was a 300 W collimated xenon lamp (Newport) calibrated with the light intensity to 100 mW cm−2 under AM 1.5G solar light conditions by a certified silicon solar cell (Fraunhofer ISE). The prepared ssDSSC samples were masked during the measurement with an aperture area of 0.126 cm2 (diameter 4 mm) exposed under illumination. IPCE spectra were recorded on a computer-controlled setup comprised of a xenon lamp (Spectral Products ASB-XE-175), a monochromator (Spectral Products CM110) and a Keithley multimeter (Model 2700). The setup was calibrated with a certified silicon solar cell (Fraunhofer ISE) prior to measurements. Electron lifetime was measured by the custom-made “toolbox setup” using a white-light-emitting diode (Luxeon Star 1W) as the light source. The solar cell device samples used in photoinduced absorption (PIA) measurements were prepared as described above except for the Ag contact layer. PIA spectra were recorded in a lab constructed setup. A 20 W tungsten–halogen lamp, filtered up to 530 nm, generated the white probe light. A square-wave modulated (on–off) green light source (Lasermate GML532-100FLE, 532 nm) was used for excitation. The transmitted probe light was focused onto a monochromator and detected by using a UV-enhanced silicon and germanium photodiode detector. 6.1 mW cm−2 light intensity and 9.3 Hz modulation frequency were used for the blue LED excitation.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Design and synthesis
As mentioned above, inadequate light harvesting capacity of sensitizing dyes and fast charge recombination losses in the device represent two major obstacles for the development of highly efficient ssDSSCs. With respect to the chemical structure of the state-of-the-art D–π–A organic dye LEG4 typically used in ssDSSCs, we have introduced quinoxaline as an auxiliary electron-withdrawing unit and a thiophene moiety into the dye molecules via molecular engineering with the aim to broaden the light-absorption spectrum. Therefore, two new quinoxaline-based D–A–π–A type organic dyes AQ309 and AQ310 were synthesized by employing EDOT and CPDT, respectively, as the π-linker units based on the structure of the D–π–A dye LEG4. Moreover, the four butyl chains and two hexyl chains in LEG4 were all replaced by the branched 2-ethyl hexyl units expected to offer larger steric hindrance for the purpose of blocking the HTM to approach the TiO2 surface and thus retarding charge-recombination losses. The synthetic routes of the new dyes AQ309 and AQ310 are described in Scheme 2, which start with a sequence of Stille-type coupling, formylation, and Knoevenagel condensation reactions. The intermediates and final sensitizers were characterized by 1H/13C NMR spectroscopy and HR-MS (Fig. S2–S18, ESI†).

3.2. Photophysical and electrochemical properties
Both AQ309 and AQ310 exhibit two major absorption bands and a shoulder peak at around 380 nm in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) (Fig. 1a). The maximum absorption peaks (λmax) in the visible region are observed at 553 nm and 569 nm for AQ309 and AQ310, respectively, which are assigned to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the donor moiety to the anchoring group. When replacing the EDOT unit with a CPDT unit, the λmax is red-shifted by 16 nm from 553 nm (AQ309) to 569 nm (AQ310) owing to the electron-rich and longer conjugation length of the CPDT unit with respect to the EDOT one. Although the absorption shapes are almost identical, AQ310 still exhibits a dramatically higher molar extinction coefficient as compared to AQ309 (Table 1). As shown in Fig. 1b, upon adsorption of AQ309 and AQ310 onto a TiO2 film (2.2 μm), the λmax is blue-shifted to 534 nm and 537 nm, respectively. This shift may be attributed to the deprotonation of the anchoring group. The dyed TiO2 film shows a weak shoulder peak at around 470 nm, which may be ascribed to the formation of H-type aggregation.30,31

In order to investigate the feasibility of electron injection and dye regeneration, the electrochemical properties of AQ309 and AQ310 were analysed by cyclic voltammetry in CH2Cl2 and the corresponding results are listed in Table 1. The ground-state oxidation potentials (E0ox) for AQ309 and AQ310 are 0.83 and 0.85 V vs. NHE, respectively, which are more positive than the oxidation potential of Spiro-OMeTAD (∼0.63 V vs. NHE) ensuring sufficient driving force for dye regeneration. In addition, the excited-state oxidation potentials  of AQ309 and AQ310 derived from the difference between ground state oxidation potential and optical energy gap (E0ox − E0–0) are −1.15 V and −1.12 V, respectively. The E0–0 is estimated from the intersection wavelength (λ) of the normalized emission and absorption curves of the dyes in solution. The  potentials of the two dyes are more negative than the conduction band edge of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE), suggesting that there should be no energetic barrier for efficient electron injection.
3.3. Theoretical calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed using the Gaussian 09 program package to optimize the ground state geometries of the dyes at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level.32–34 To facilitate calculations, the long alkyl chains were replaced by methyl groups on the premise of guaranteeing the essential of frontier molecular orbitals. Time-dependent (TD) DFT calculations were carried out to calculate the 20 lowest singlet electronic transitions at the optimized structures using the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d) basis set.35 Considering the solvent effects in CH2Cl2, a polarizable continuum model (PCM) was introduced throughout the calculations.36
Quantum chemical calculations suggest that both the AQ309 and the AQ310 molecules exhibit similar features in the spatial distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals, where the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels are mainly located on the triarylamine donor moieties and the thiophene π-bridge, while the HOMO−1 extends over almost the whole molecular structures. Besides, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels are largely dominated by the quinoxaline, EDOT/CPDT and cyanoacrylic acid units (Table 2). It is valuable to note from TD-DFT calculations that the HOMO → LUMO transition predominantly contributes to the maximum absorption bands of AQ309, and AQ310 with minor contribution from the HOMO−1 → LUMO transition. The oscillator strength (f) calculated for the transitions at low energies is 1.71 and 2.39 for AQ309 and AQ310, respectively, which is consistent with the trend of molar extinction coefficients derived from the experimental spectra (Table 3).

3.4. Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic properties of the two AQ dyes were investigated by fabricating ssDSSCs employing Spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM, and the LEG4 dye-based device was used as a reference. The photocurrent voltage (J–V) curves of the best ssDSSCs based on AQ309, AQ310 and LEG4 are shown in Fig. 2a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are collected in Table 4. Under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) conditions, the AQ310-based devices showed an open-circuit photovoltage (VOC) of 0.87 V, a short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) of 12.3 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.75, yielding a record PCE of 8.0%. It is also interesting to note that an excellent high PCE of 8.6% was obtained for the champion ssDSSCs based on AQ310 under 50% solar illumination (Fig. 2b). In comparison, the AQ309-based devices exhibited a lower PCE of 6.8% with a VOC of 0.82 V, a JSC of 11.5 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.72. Clearly, the change of the π-bridge unit has a significant influence on the device characteristics. In comparison to the dye AQ309, the dye AQ310 shows a wider absorption spectrum as well as a higher molar extinction coefficient, leading to a higher JSC. The higher VOC of the AQ310-based ssDSSCs might be speculated to be caused by the two 2-ethyl hexyl chains introduced into the CPDT unit potentially blocking the HTMs to approach the TiO2 surface and thus suppress the electron–hole recombination processes. As a result, the solar cells based on AQ310 offer better device performance than AQ309-based ones. This indirectly shows that the CPDT unit with long alkyl chains is a better choice when building the sensitizers as compared to the EDOT unit. The reference devices based on LEG4 containing the CPDT moiety also show a PCE of 7.3% with a VOC of 0.88 V, a JSC of 11.4 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.73. In addition, the distribution and standard deviation of the solar cell efficiencies based on different dyes are shown in Fig. 3 and the average photovoltaic parameters of the devices are tabulated in Table 4. As can be seen from the results, all these dyes display better reproducibility, and the average efficiency of AQ310-based devices was 7.34%, which is higher than that of the efficiencies obtained with LEG4- (6.68%) and AQ309-based cells (6.10%), respectively. Clearly, the D–A–π–A dyes not only improve the device performance, but also exhibit better device reproducibility than traditionally featured D–π–A structure dyes.

 Fig. 3  Distribution and standard deviation of the ssDSSC device efficiencies based on different dyes (at least 16 devices were studied). 

Fig. 2c displays the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the ssDSSCs and the corresponding integrated photocurrents based on AQ309, AQ310 and LEG4. Interestingly, LEG4-based devices show a higher IPCE close to 80% from 420 to 550 nm than those of the AQ dyes arriving at IPCEs around 70% from 420 to 500 nm. This might be due to the higher molar extinction coefficient (Table 1) and a larger amount of dye loading on the TiO2 electrode of the former dye (Table 4). However, the AQ dye-based devices obviously exhibit much broader IPCE curves (Fig. 2c) than the LEG4-based devices, leading to a higher JSC, in turn resulting in better device performance. In addition, the IPCE curves of the dye-based devices are in good agreement with their respective absorption spectra on TiO2 films (Fig. 1b), and the integrated photocurrents from the IPCE spectra match the measured JSC well (Fig. 2c). Exhilaratingly, the unpacked cells were stored in the dark in a desiccator with humidity below 15%. After 4 months, the efficiencies of the devices decrease only around 15% (Fig. S19†). These results indicate that molecular engineering is a promising strategy to develop new D–A–π–A dyes with broad absorption spectra enhancing the PCE and stability of ssDSSCs.
3.5. Electron lifetime and photo-induced absorption measurements
Transient photovoltage decay was used to investigate the interfacial electron recombination by measuring the electron lifetime (τe) of the devices based on AQ309, AQ310 and LEG4, and the corresponding curves of τe plotted vs. VOC are shown in Fig. 2d. In general, the higher τe values indicate slower electron–hole recombination reactions in the devices. The high VOC recorded for the devices indicate that recombination losses is relatively low.37 The τe values of the devices decrease in the order LEG4 > AQ310 > AQ309 as noted from Fig. 2d, which agrees well with the device VOC values recorded. In particular, the τe of the AQ309-based device is considerably shorter than that of the LEG4 and AQ310-based ones, which might be attributed to the bulky chemical structure of the CPDT unit in LEG4 and AQ310 retarding the charge recombination between the HTMs and injected electrons in the devices.
In order to investigate the kinetics of dye regeneration in relation to the device performance, photo-induced absorption spectroscopy (PIA) was performed for the three dyes (AQ309, AQ310, and LEG4) adsorbed to a TiO2 film in the absence/presence of the HTM.38,39 As shown in Fig. 4, negative ΔA signals are found at around 600 nm because of the reduced absorption signals of the ground-state dye (D), while positive ΔA signals are recorded in the region of 700–1000 nm for AQ309 and AQ310, and in the range of 650–800 nm for LEG4 mainly attributed to the oxidized-state dyes (D+). The comparison between the PIA spectra (black) in the absence of the HTM and the spectra in the presence of the HTM (red) reflects a reduced absorption signal of D+ due to the rapid dye regeneration. Clearly, the ΔA effects of AQ310 drop by nearly 90% in the presence of the HTM-Spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. 4b). This may indicate that AQ310 could be more efficiently regenerated by Spiro-OMeTAD. This also agrees well with the higher JSC recorded for the AQ310-based ssDSSC.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, molecular engineering was carried out by replacing the EDOT unit with a CPDT unit in the dye π-system in order to generate two new quinoxaline-based D–A–π–A organic sensitizers (AQ309 and AQ310) used in ssDSSCs. Devices based on AQ310 containing the CPDT unit attained an impressive record PCE of 8.0%, which is considerably higher than the efficiency of 6.8% for devices based on the EDOT-containing dye AQ309. It should be noted that the devices based on the state-of-the-art organic D–π–A dye LEG4 offer a PCE of 7.3% clearly lower than the AQ310-based ones. Moreover, AQ310-based ssDSSCs show a much longer electron lifetime, demonstrating lower charge recombination losses in the devices. Consequently, this work highlights a feasible strategy of molecular engineering to develop new D–A–π–A organic dyes for highly efficient ssDSSCs.
