    , Accepted 30th July 2012First published on 23rd August 2012AbstractWith the rising interest in using the medium bandgap polymer, poly(2,7-carbazole-alt-4,7-dithienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole) (PCDTBT) with deep HOMO energy level for polymer solar cells (PSCs), we have developed an analogous polymer with a lower bandgap, namely, poly(2,7-carbazole-alt-4,7-dithienyl-2,1,3-naphthothiadiazole) (PCDTNT) by replacing 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) with 2,1,3-naphthothiadiazole (NT) in PCDTBT. Its optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties are fully characterized in comparison with PCDTBT. Clearly, the λmax position of PCDTNT is significantly red-shifted by ∼30 nm, corresponding to a lower optical bandgap (1.71 eV) from the absorption edge of the thin film than that of PCDTBT (1.88 eV). A bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) PSC that incorporated PCDTNT with the low-lying HOMO energy level as a p-type material delivers a higher VOC value of 0.81 V and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) value of 1.31%.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have received global attention because of their potential advantages such as cost effectiveness, light weight, flexibility, and solution processability.1–5 To date, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) has achieved a great success as a donor material in bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs, yielding power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 3–5%.6–11 However, further improvements in the efficiency have not yet emerged with P3HT since it harvests only a limited range of the solar spectrum (bandgap ∼ 1.9 eV). For a better sunlight absorption, one of the most powerful strategies is the utilization of donor–acceptor (D–A) architecture in the polymer backbone.12–14 In fact, through the rational choice of D and A units, various D–A copolymers with a low bandgap have been reported, resulting in higher PCEs by mainly increasing the short-circuit current density (JSC).15–17
2,7-Carbazole is an attractive electron-rich building block to construct D–A copolymers with a low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level that leads to a high open-circuit voltage (VOC) on BHJ PSCs.13,18 Amongst numbers of D–A copolymers based on 2,7-carbazole derivatives, poly(2,7-carbazole-alt-4,7-dithienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole) (PCDTBT)19 has shown excellent PCEs by the device structure optimization.18,19 However, PCDTBT still possesses a large bandgap (∼1.88 eV).19 Recently, to simultaneously take structural advantage of PCDTBT and its lower bandgap relative to PCDTBT, Hsu et al.20 and our group21 independently reported PCDTBT-based ladder-type polymers with forced planarity of which initial device performance showed a promising PCE of 3.7% with a reduced bandgap (∼0.2 eV) in comparison with that of PCDTBT. However, tedious synthetic methodologies of the ladder-type PCDTBTs have restricted the realization of their usage in BHJ devices. Along these lines, we have focused on tuning the conjugation length in the polymer backbone to efficiently decrease the bandgap without the complicated modifications, whilst maintaining the structural analogy of PCDTBT. Considering the extended aromatic conjugation of 2,1,3-naphthothiadiazole (NT) over 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT), we present an easily obtainable NT analogue of PCDTBT with a lower bandgap, namely, poly(2,7-carbazole-alt-4,7-dithienyl-2,1,3-naphthothiadiazole) (PCDTNT) of which design motif is outlined in Fig. 1. Not only do we thoroughly describe the optoelectronic features of PCDTNT including cyclic voltammetry (CV), density functional theory (DFT) of the electronic structure, and transistor characteristics but also our preliminary investigation on the photovoltaic properties of PCDTNT in typical BHJ devices with PCBM is presented.

Instruments for characterization

1H and 13C NMR were recorded on a Varian VNRS 600 MHz spectrophotometer using the deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) with TMS as an internal standard. Elemental analyses of carbon, hydrogen and sulfur were carried out with a Flesh 2000 elemental analyzer and mass spectra were measured with a Varian 450-GC & 320-MS. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a Q200 from thermal analysis (TA) instruments at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in a N2 atmosphere. To investigate molecular weight and polydispersity index (PDI) of the new polymer, gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was carried out with Agilent 1200 series and miniDAWN TREOS using tetrahydrofuran (THF) as a solvent against PS as a standard. UV-vis absorption spectrum was recorded on a Varian Carry 5000 spectrophotometer at room temperature. The electrochemical data were obtained from a VersaSTAT3 Princeton Applied Research Potentiostat in a three-electrode cell system using 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in acetonitrile as the electrolyte. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed using a Digital Instruments dimension AFM controlled by a nanoscope scanning probe microscope controller.
Photovoltaic device fabrication
Polymer solar cell devices were fabricated according to the following procedure. First, the indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrate was cleaned with detergent, then ultrasonicated in distilled water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol, and then dried overnight in an oven at 100 °C. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Baytron PH) was spin-cast at 4000 rpm for 40 s. The substrate was then dried for 10 min at 140 °C in air. Subsequently, it is moved into a glove box for spin-coating the active layer. A mixed solution of PCDTNT:PC71BM (1:3 w/w) with and without 1,8-octanedithiol (ODT) as an additive in o-dichlorobenzene (DCB) was then spin coated at 1000 rpm for 60 s on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer to obtain a BHJ film. The BHJ devices for various ratios have been scanned from 1:1 to 1:4 of PCDTNT:PC71BM blends for optimization, but the 1:3 ratio of PCDTNT:PC71BM gave the best performance. These samples were brought into a vacuum system (about 10−7 Torr), and an Al electrode (100 nm) was deposited on top of the BHJ layer. Typical devices were thermal annealed for 5 min at 150 °C.
Organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) fabrication
Heavily doped n-type silicon (Si) wafers were used as substrates, and a layer of 200 nm of silicon dioxide (SiO2: grown by thermal oxidation) was used as the gate dielectric layer. Au (60 nm) was successively evaporated with a shadow mask to obtain source and drain electrodes. The interdigitated structure of the source–drain contacts determined a channel length of 50 μm and a channel width of 2950 μm. Substrates were cleaned by acetone and isopropanol and dried at 100 °C in an oven for 20 min, and treated with octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) at room temperature for over 12 h to treat the surface. Organic semiconductor layers (60 nm) were deposited by spin-coating at 2000 rpm. All fabrication processes were carried out in a glove box filled with N2. Electrical characterization was performed using a Keithley semiconductor parametric analyzer (Keithley 4200-SCS) under a N2 atmosphere. The charge carrier mobility (μ) was determined using the following equation in the saturation regime:Ids = (WCi/2L) × μ × (Vgs − VT)2,where Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the SiO2 dielectric (Ci = 15 nF cm−2) and VT is the threshold voltage.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthetic routes to produce the intermediates and polymer (PCDTNT) are outlined in Scheme 1. First, 2,3-diaminonaphthalene (1) was brominated using bromine in acetic acid and subsequently followed by intramolecular cyclization with thionyl chloride in a mixed solution of pyridine and chloroform, generating dibromo-NT compound 3. Pd-catalyzed Stille coupling reaction of 3 and 2-tributylstannylthiophene gave dithienyl NT (DTNT) 5, which was converted into the corresponding dibromide monomer by treatment with NBS in chloroform. The comonomer 2,7-bis(4′,4′,5′,5′-tetramethyl-1′,3′,2′-dioxaborolan-2′-yl)-N-9′′-heptadecanylcarbazole (6) was synthesized according to reported methods.19 Suzuki polymerization with 5 and 6 was carried out in the presence of Pd2(dba)3 and P(o-tolyl)3 as a catalyst and ligand in a mixture of toluene and aqueous K3PO4 to afford an alternating copolymer PCDTNT as a dark purple solid. PCDTNT has good solubility in common organic solvents (chloroform, THF, toluene, etc.) at room temperature. GPC analysis of PCDTNT using THF exhibits an Mn value of 12800 g mol−1 with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.67 against polystyrene (PS) as a standard.

The resonances at 8.53–7.48 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum of PCDTNT are assigned to protons on the carbazole and DTNT units (Fig. 2). The peaks between 4.68 and 0.77 ppm are attributed to the protons of the hepta-decanyl chains. The peak area ratio between the aromatic and aliphatic protons in the NMR spectrum agrees with the molecular structure of PCDTNT.

Thermostability
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) shows that the onset decomposition temperature (Td) of PCDTNT is around 425 °C (Fig. 3(a)), indicating an excellent thermal stability. This implies that devices fabricated with PCDTNT would be as stable as those of PCDTBT that are both stable in air at room temperature and capable of withstanding high temperatures for extended periods of time.19,22

Optical properties

Fig. 3(b) depicts UV-visible absorption spectra of PCDTNT in chloroform solution and on the thin film. PCDTNT in solution shows a π–π* absorption maximum at 368 nm and an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) band at 553 nm, while that on the film exhibits broadened and red-shifted absorption bands at 380 and 584 nm, respectively due to closer packing in the solid state.23,24 The optical bandgap (Egopt) of PCDTNT is estimated to be 1.71 eV (onset ∼ 724 nm, Egopt,film = 1240/λonset (nm)). It turns out that PCDTNT exhibits lower bandgap than that of PCDTBT (1.87 eV),19 verifying the motivation of this work about the effect of extended aromatic π-conjugation of NT. Note that PCDTBT exhibited similar absorption intensities between the high-energy and the lower-energy peaks, whereas in the case of PCDTNT, the intensity of the ICT band is observed to be relatively lower than that of the π–π* absorption band. This is most likely attributed to a strong steric interaction between NT and adjacent thienyl units in the polymer,25 slightly impeding the effective ICT between the donor and acceptor blocks.
Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) of the PCDTNT thin film was performed on a platinum electrode in 0.1 M Bu4NPF6–acetonitrile solution at room temperature. As depicted in Fig. 4, the oxidation and reduction potentials determined from the onset values are 0.73 V and −1.01 V, respectively. The corresponding HOMO and LUMO energy levels calculated against ferrocene as an internal standard are −5.37 eV and −3.63 eV, respectively, which fit reasonably well with the required electronic levels for BHJ PSCs utilizing PCBM derivatives as the acceptor. The electrochemical bandgap (Egec) is 1.74 eV that matches well with its Egopt. Compared to PCDTBT, the replacement of BT with NT rings in the polymer backbone lifts the HOMO energy level with the LUMO level being almost unchanged.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculation
In order to provide deeper insight into the molecular structure of PCDTNT, a model system based on the repeating unit containing methyl side chains on the carbazole block was calculated by using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G* with Gaussian 09 package. The HOMO wave function is delocalized along the whole conjugated backbone of the polymer. For the LUMO, the distribution of density of states is mainly localized on the NT unit. This observation is quite similar to typical D–A polymers used as p-type materials in the BHJ devices. In addition, a non-planar conformation with strong twist angles of ∼40 °C between the two thienyl and NT units (Fig. 5), supporting our presumption aforementioned about the reduced intensity of the ICT band, is found.

Organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and photovoltaic properties
Bottom gate/top-contact organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) with gold source–drain electrodes were used to test the charge transport behavior of PCDTNT (Fig. 6). As expected, the FET device based on PCDTNT shows the hole mobility of 2 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is typical as a p-type semiconductor.

BHJ solar cells using the blends of PCDTNT and PC71BM26,27 with different weight ratios were fabricated and the photovoltaic properties were measured under the illumination of AM 1.5 G and an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The post-production annealing at a high temperature (∼150 °C) was performed since it has been proven to be a very efficient method for improving the electrical characteristics of conventional PSCs.

Fig. 7(a) shows current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the cells with and without 1,8-octanedithiol (ODT) as an additive, respectively. The PCDTNT:PC71BM device has a JSC of 2.00 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.69 V, and a FF of 30%, yielding a PCE of 0.42%. An addition of 1.0 v/v% ODT is helpful to get better photovoltaic properties in PCDTNT:PC71BM-based cells, resulting in a PCE of 1.31% with a JSC of 4.98 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.81 V, and FF of 33%.

Apparently, the solar cells based on PCDTNT show a high VOC of 0.81 V compared to the typical donor polymers, which is attributed to the low-lying HOMO of PCDTNT. However, the limiting factor of its photovoltaic performance is mainly the significantly lower FF. Although concrete evidence of the reasons is lacking at this stage, this may be due to the combined effects: (i) the relatively low molecular weight of PCDTNT, (ii) the unfavorable morphology between donor and acceptor components due to the bulky NT building block, and/or (iii) the intrinsic low charge carrier mobility of PCDTNT.
To confirm the accuracy of the measurement, an incident photon to charge carrier efficiency (IPCE) spectrum for the best cell was acquired and is shown in Fig. 7(b). The maximum value of IPCE is estimated to be 33.7% at 400 nm. The IPCE spectrum is entirely consistent with the results of J–V characteristics. The distribution of the IPCE spectrum is also similar to that of the UV-visible absorption of PCDTNT.
Atomic force microscopy

Fig. 8 shows atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the PCDTNT:PC71BM films with and without the additive, respectively. The morphology of the pristine film shows large domains with a root-mean-squared (rms) surface roughness of 9.49 nm. Such a formation in polymer:PC71BM blends is often observed and has been found to be detrimental to BHJ PSCs.28,29 Processing with ODT results in a much more homogeneous, finer phase separation (rms = 4.23 nm) with nanoscale texture. The improved morphology can explain the enhanced photocurrent (2.00 vs. 4.98 mA cm−2).

Conclusions
In summary, for further narrowing the bandgap of the well-known PCDTBT without sacrificing its structural advantage, we have used the 2,1,3-naphthothiadiazole (NT) unit in place of 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) in the polymer backbone, yielding a poly(2,7-carbazole-alt-4,7-dithienyl-2,1,3-naphthothiadiazole) (PCDTNT). The polymer PCDTNT simultaneously possesses an excellent solubility for solution-processability and a low bandgap (1.71 eV) with suitable position of HOMO–LUMO energy levels. Despite a high VOC (0.81 V) on the photovoltaic performance of PCDTNT-based BHJ solar cells, a significantly lower FF leads to an overall low efficiency. Taking its deep-lying HOMO and low bandgap into account, there is still plenty of room to establish better efficiencies of BHJ PSCs. We highlight that this work opens a door to the applications of NT-based polymers in BHJ PSCs.
