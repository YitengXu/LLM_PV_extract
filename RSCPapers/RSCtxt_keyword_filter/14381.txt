    , Accepted 29th June 2020First published on 30th June 2020AbstractThe inferior stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation has been a bottleneck for their further commercialization. Herein, we report a simple strategy to enhance the UV stability of PSCs by using an alkaloid 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) doped C60 electron transport layer (ETL). By improving the electron mobility of ETLs to 2 cm2 V−1 s−1 and optimizing the conduction band position to 4.2 eV, the DBU-doped C60 (DBU-C60) ETLs enable the rigid and flexible planner n-i-p PSCs to exhibit PCEs of 20% and 16%, respectively. Most importantly, the devices based on the DBU-C60 ETLs retain over 80% of their initial efficiency after storage either under UV irradiation for 336 h or light socking for 1000 h in an ambient environment. These results indicate that the optimized C60 is a promising electron transport material to stabilize the PSCs under UV light illumination without the cost of efficiency loss.
Introduction
Recent research has witnessed unparalleled advances in organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with the certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) leaping to 25.2%.1–6 The current top-performing n-i-p structured PSCs mainly rely on the use of TiO2 as the electron transport layer (ETL) owing to its suitable band alignment and high transmittance.7,8 However, the poor photostability of the TiO2-based PSCs restricts their further commercialization, especially under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation.9–12 Upon UV light exposure, photo generated negative charges accumulate at the TiO2/perovskite interface, which then accelerates the irreversible moisture-driven decomposition of perovskite materials under ambient conditions.10,13–15
To address this problem, various non-photocatalytic materials have been exploited as ETLs, including inorganic materials (SnO2, ZnO2, WOX and La-BaSnO3)16–27 and organic materials (ionic-liquids and fullerene-derivative).28–33 Due to the high electron mobility and extreme stability, fullerene (C60) has been considered as a promising electron transport material to enhance the UV stability of the PSCs, which benefit from its highest central symmetry in three-dimensional Euclidean space, internal–external double spherical p electron cloud and lack of molecular defects.10,34–36 Low-temperature solution-processed C60 ETLs were successfully used to suppress the continuous degradation of perovskite devices and retained over 70% of their initial efficiency after hundreds of hours of UV irradiation.9,12 However, the PCEs of the C60-based n-i-p PSCs are still limited by the energy level mismatch and charge transport resistance among the carbon spheres.10 Therefore, there is still a lack of an effective and facile route to improve the charge transport of C60 ETLs in PSCs, which would make it truly compete with TiO2 materials.
Herein, we report a simple method to adjust the energy alignment and enhance the electron transfer property for the low-temperature solution-processed C60 ETLs via an alkaloid-type n-dopant of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU). The DBU doping remarkably increased the electron mobility of the C60 ETLs by 1.5 fold and up-shifted the conduction band compared with that of the pristine C60 film. By adjusting the energy alignment and improving the charge transport, the DBU-doped C60 (DBU-C60) ETLs enabled the planner n-i-p PSCs to show an efficiency of 20% and operate stably for over 300 h under UV irradiation. In addition, the flexible PSC based on the DBU-C60 ETLs exhibits a PCE of 16% and a good mechanical stability. This work confirms that C60 is a promising electron transport material to stabilize the PSCs under UV light without the cost of efficiency loss.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the schematic structure of a planar PSC based on the DBU-C60 ETL. A small amount of DBU is introduced into the C60 film to improve its charge transport properties. To investigate the effect of DBU doping, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements (Fig. 1b) were first carried out to confirm the interaction of DBU with C60. Notably, the FTIR peak located at 1427 cm−1 representing the C–C symmetric stretching of C60 significantly shifts to a higher wavenumber of 1440 cm−1, which may be attributed to the electron transfer from the electron-rich DBU to the spherical p electron cloud of C60.37,38 UV-vis transmittance spectra (Fig. 1c) indicate that both the C60 and DBU-C60 films have high transparency at the visible wavelength range. It is interesting to note that the transparency of the DBU-C60 film is higher than that of the pristine C60 film in the range of 350–450 nm, likely due to the reduced reflection. The transmission difference implies that DBU-C60 ETLs would enable a higher photon-flux to be harvested by the perovskite layers to generate more carriers.10,39

The vertical electron mobility of the ETLs is studied using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. Fig. 1d displays the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the electron-only devices and the electron mobility is calculated following the Mott–Gurney law.9,40 The electron mobility of the DBU-C60 ETLs is 2 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is 1.5 fold more than that of the C60 ETLs and several orders of magnitude higher than that of popular TiO2 ETLs.41 The high electron mobility is expected to contribute to the high short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) in the PSCs. Besides, the energy levels of the DBU-C60 ETLs were measured using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) as shown in Fig. 1e and the corresponding energy band diagrams are displayed in Fig. 1f. Obviously, the conduction band edge of the DBU-C60 ETLs is optimally positioned at about 4.2 eV to promote the electron extraction from the perovskite and the subsequent injection into the electrode.42,43 This energy offset would greatly enhance the open circuit photovoltage (VOC) for a higher performance of the PSCs.

Fig. 2a and Fig. S1 (ESI†) show the cross-section scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the low-temperature solution-processed DBU-C60 and C60 ETL, which completely cover the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) surface with a thickness of ∼50 nm. In addition, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the C60 and DBU-C60 ETLs (Fig. S2 (ESI†) and Fig. 2b) show a broadened peak around 25°, indicating the amorphous nature of the fullerene. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. S3, ESI†) and contact angle (Fig. S4, ESI†) measurements indicate that a small amount of DBU doping does not change the roughness and surface energy of the C60 films. The crystallization of the perovskite films deposited on the C60-based ETLs is also determined using XRD measurements as shown in Fig. 2c. The perovskite film on DBU-C60 ETLs exhibits stronger characteristic peaks than that on the C60 ETLs, which is mainly attributed to the regulated nucleation and growth of perovskite by the interfacial Lewis base as mentioned in previous reports.44,45 The higher crystallinity of the perovskite films could suppress the trap-induced charge recombination and then facilitate the charge extraction and transport. The dark J–V analysis of the electron-only device was conducted with the voltage between 0.1 and 1.2 V to quantify the electron trap-state density in the perovskite films. Fig. 2d shows three regions: the linear ohmic response region, the trap-filling region and the trap-free SCLC region. The bias voltage, where the kink point between the ohmic response and the trap-filling regions locates, is determined as the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL). And the trap-state densities (Nt) of the perovskite film on different ETLs are calculated from the corresponding VTFL using the following equation: (1)where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the perovskite, and L and q represent the thickness of the film and the elemental charge, respectively. With the VTFL reducing from 1.51 V to 0.88 V, the trap densities of the perovskite films decrease from 6.6 × 1015 cm−3 to 3.8 × 1015 cm−3 when the DBU-C60 films are introduced to replace pristine C60 as ETLs, consistent with the XRD results (Fig. 2c) and are likely to reduce the J–V hysteresis in the PSCs.46

(d) Dark current–voltage curves of the electron-only device revealing the VTFL inflection point behavior. (e) Steady-state PL spectra and (f) TRPL spectra of the perovskite films deposited on different ETLs. 
To explore the effects of the DBU dopant on the interface between ETLs and perovskite layers, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) were performed for the perovskite films on different ETLs using an excitation source with a 488 nm laser. The steady state PL spectra (Fig. 2e) show that the PL intensity of the DBU-C60 sample is obviously quenched compared to the C60 sample, demonstrating that the DBU-C60 ETLs are more effective in electron extraction and transport owing to their higher electron mobility and suitable conduction band position. Fig. 2f shows the TRPL spectra of the perovskite films on C60 and DBU-C60 ETLs to further examine the photo-induced carrier kinetics at the ETL/perovskite interface. For the C60 sample, τ1 and τ2 are defined to be 6.6 ns and 20.2 ns for the amplitudes of 98% and 2%, respectively. When the DBU-C60 ETLs are used, τ1 drops to 3.3 ns and τ2 increases to 20.8 ns with the corresponding amplitudes of 99% and 1%, respectively. τave is significantly reduced to 4.3 ns from 7.4 ns when DBU-C60 films are introduced as ETLs. The shortened PL decay time specifies more efficient electron extraction and a faster electron-transfer process, which is beneficial for the VOC and FF of the PSCs.

Fig. 3a shows the cross-section SEM image of the planner PSC structured as FTO/DBU-C60/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. To obtain the best performance, the DBU-C60 ETLs should fully cover the FTO substrate to avoid electric leakage, while it also cannot be so thick as to increase the series resistance in the devices. In our case, the optimized thickness of the DBU-C60 ETL is 50 nm and a 400 nm-thick perovskite layer is deposited for light capturing. We optimized the device performance based on different ETLs (Table S1, ESI†) and the best device performances are shown in Fig. 3b. It was found that the PSCs using the DBU-C60 ETLs showed a better device performance taking advantage of all the device performance parameters. The C60-based device showed a VOC of 1.00 V, a JSC of 23.48 mA cm−2, an FF of 75.68% and a PCE of 17.65%. In contrast, the device with the DBU-C60 ETL showed a VOC of 1.10 V, a JSC of 23.56 mA cm−2, an FF of 76.80% and a PCE of 19.98%. Furthermore, the JSC is in excellent accordance with the external quantum efficiency (EQE) result shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†).47 Importantly, the different scan directions (Fig. 3c) show almost the same performance of the DBU-C60-based devices with a minor hysteresis. And the histograms of efficiencies (Fig. S6, ESI†) exhibit a great reproducibility for the DBU-C60-based devices, which is meaningful for the commercialization of the PSCs.

To further understand the performance enhancement, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out to study the interfacial charge transport dynamics. Fig. 3d displays the Nyquist plots of different ETL-based devices at an applied bias voltage of 0.8 V under 1 sun illumination. When the DBU-C60 ETLs are introduced, the series resistance (RS) is successfully decreased and the recombination resistance (RREC) is effectively increased compared to those of the C60-based PSCs. That is, the interfacial contact between the ETLs and perovskite layers is improved by DBU dopant, which well suppresses the carrier recombination at the interface. We also measured the open-circuit photovoltage decays (OCVD) for these devices to extract the slow phenomena at a characteristic time from the hierarchical recombination process. The exponential decay distribution of the OCVD (Fig. 3e) reveals that the VOC decay time constant in the DBU-C60-based device is fitted as 0.3 ms, which is 3 times longer than that (0.1 ms) of the C60-based device. The corresponding carrier lifetime (Fig. S7, ESI†) of the devices is calculated from the OCVD curves and a prolonged carrier lifetime of the DBU-C60-based PSCs is obtained over the same voltage region, indicating a slower charge recombination rate in the devices with DBU-C60 ETLs. In addition, the light intensity dependence of VOC shows the ideality factors (n) of devices based on different ETLs as shown in Fig. 3f. The n values of the devices are remarkably reduced from 1.86 to 1.29 after using DBU-C60 ETLs, suggesting that the DBU dopant in C60 ETLs considerably reduces the non-uniform recombination centers in the devices following the Shockley–Read–Hall theory.48
The stability of the PSCs is a critical requirement for reproducibility and commercialized production.49,50 The steady-state PCE is measured under simulated AM 1.5G sunlight at 100 mW cm−2 using the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of the devices with C60, DBU-C60 and compact TiO2 (c-TiO2) ETLs as shown in Fig. 4a. The stabilized PCEs of the solar cells based on C60 and DBU-C60 ETLs measured at the MPPT are well consistent with those measured from J–V scanning. In addition, the fullerene-based PSCs operate steadily after 500 s light soaking without any performance degradation, demonstrating their excellent photostability. On the contrary, the device using the c-TiO2 ETL shows a continuous PCE decay after the response stage, which suggests a significant effect of the light irradiation on performance degradation in the c-TiO2 ETL-based devices. The long-term stability of the unencapsulated PSCs is evaluated under simulated AM 1.5G sunlight at 100 mW cm−2 and ambient conditions with a relative humidity (RH) of about 50% at room temperature (25 °C). The PCEs of the devices based on DBU-C60, C60 and c-TiO2 ETLs were periodically recorded and the normalized PCEs against time are shown in Fig. 4b. It is found that both DBU-C60 and C60-based devices retain over 80% of their initial PCEs after light soaking for 1000 h and show a good long-term stability, while the PCE of the device with c-TiO2 ETLs decreases to ∼50% after 1000 h under the same exposure and testing conditions, which is consistent with the MPPT results. To explore the degradation mechanism, a 340 nm UV-light soaking experiment was conducted to examine the UV stability of these devices in the same ambient environment (Fig. 4c). Importantly, we found that both DBU-C60 and C60-based devices retain 80% of their initial PCEs after over 300 h UV light irradiation in an ambient environment. However, the c-TiO2-based PSCs completely degrade after UV irradiation in the same environment.

The Mott–Schottky plot of (d) DBU-C60, (e) C60 and (f) c-TiO2-based PSCs was obtained before and after UV irradiation. 
To further comprehend the differences between fullerene and TiO2 on UV stability, the capacitance–voltage (C–V) was measured and the corresponding interfacial charge densities of the devices are inversely proportional to the slope of the Mott–Schottky (MS) plots as mentioned in previous reports.10Fig. 4d–f display the MS plots of devices using different ETLs before and after 100 h UV irradiation in air, where the PSCs still work and exhibit different PCE degradations. Before the UV light irradiation, the slopes of the MS plots for these three devices are in the same order of magnitude (∼1011 V−1 F−2 cm4). However, the slope of the c-TiO2 based PSC decreases significantly to 10 V−1 F−2 cm4, which is one order of magnitude lower than that of the fullerene-based PSC. The obvious slope change for the c-TiO2 based device before and after UV irradiation illustrates that numerous negative charges accumulate at the ETL/perovskite interface, which attributes to the low electron mobility and oxygen vacancies of TiO2. It has been certified in previous reports that the interfacial charge accumulation between the ETL and perovskite film strengthens the hydrogen interaction between H2O and the organic cation and further results in the moisture-driven decomposition of perovskite films under UV light illumination.36 Therefore, the DBU-C60 films have been proven to be promising ETLs to stabilize the PSCs under UV light without the cost of efficiency loss.
To verify that DBU-C60 ETLs are applicable to flexible PSCs, we fabricated the device with the DBU-C60 ETL on ITO-coated polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates as schematically shown in Fig. 5a. Fig. 5b shows the digital camera image of the fabricated flexible PSCs with the structure of PET/ITO/DBU-C60/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. The J–V curve of the flexible PSCs exhibits a JSC of 21.62 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.01 V, an FF of 74.22%, and a PCE of 16.25% with minor hysteresis (Fig. 5c). The lower efficiency compared to that of the rigid device is mainly attributed to the higher series resistance of the flexible substrates. To observe the mechanical stability of the flexible PSCs, we carried out a bending test with 300 consecutive bending cycles at radii of curvatures (Rb) of 8 mm as shown in Fig. 5d. The flexible device retained nearly 90% of its initial PCE after 300 bending cycles, suggesting a good stability against the mechanical bending for the DBU-C60-based flexible PSCs.

Conclusions
The low-temperature solution-processed DBU-C60 has been successfully used as an effective ETL for PSCs. The PCE of the champion device based on the DBU-C60 ETLs is as high as 20%, which is among the highest values reported so far for C60-based n-i-p PSCs. Besides, the flexible PSC based on the DBU-C60 ETLs exhibits a PCE of 16% and a good mechanical stability. The outstanding performance is originated from the high electron mobility and the optimized energy alignment. In particular, the DBU-C60 ETLs reduce the trap-state density of the films and prolong the carrier lifetime, leading to effectively suppressed hysteresis. Moreover, the DBU-C60 ETLs enable the planner PSCs to operate stably for over 300 h under UV irradiation and 1000 h under light soaking in the ambient environment. The present study highlights a new direction of using optimized C60 ETLs to replace the conventional TiO2 to enhance the UV stability of the PSCs without the cost of efficiency loss.
