Herein, the effects of the vertical electric field and biaxial strain on the electronic, optical and transport properties of SeWS (SWSe)/h-BP vdWHs are systematically investigated using density functional theory calculations.

I. Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) materials have received widespread attention for their excellent physicochemical properties, adaptability and versatility.1–5 The 2D materials exhibit significant differences in various properties compared to bulk, which is due to quantum confinement effects. With the successful synthesis and studies of more 2D materials, a new type of composite material named van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) came into view, which stacks different monolayers together to exhibit excellent performance.6–8 The vdWHs broaden the applicability of materials in different applications by integrating the inherent properties of different 2D materials.9–12 The type of interfacial atom and the interlayer distance influence the interlayer polarization, thus significantly influencing the band shift, interlayer bond strength and interband hopping properties of the vdWHs. The material design has been in the spotlight, and the construction of vdWHs will create more opportunities for the application of more new composite materials in various areas.13 Hexagonal boron phosphide (h-BP) is composed of group III–V elements with an atomic structure similar to graphene. The multilayer h-BP films have been successfully prepared in the laboratory by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) using silicon carbide as a precursor.14,15 The h-BP layer is a direct bandgap semiconductor material, which has attracted much attention for its excellent properties of small effective mass and high carrier mobility.16,17 One study showed that the thermal conductivity of synthesised BP single crystals was as high as 540 W m−1 K−1, making them promising materials for thermal management.18 Meanwhile, a study has claimed that BP is a candidate for a new refractory hard material with a high temperature resistance.19 Presently, the h-BP monolayer is not yet successfully prepared, but its excellent performance warrants further theoretical investigation.
A Janus 2D material with inherent Rashba spin splitting and out-of-plane dipole moments was recently proposed.19,20 The Janus transition metal dihalides (TMDs) with a formula of XMY (M = Mo, W; X of XMY (M = and Te) are an important class of materials due to their structures, electronic properties and other properties. The Janus 2D materials cannot be found in nature. Nevertheless, Li and colleagues successfully synthesised the first Janus SeMoS monolayer of molybdenum disulphide by CVD in 2017, which provides the basis for theoretical and experimental studies of other Janus-type materials.21 The Janus SeWS monolayer undergoes excellent photocatalytic hydrolysis,22,23 and has a strong absorption coefficient in the visible range and excellent thermoelectric properties.24,25 Zheng et al. reported that exciton formation in the Janus SeWS layer was nearly 30% faster than in the pristine TMDs and that the exciton radiative recombination lifetime was longer.26 The intrinsic dipole moment of SeWS caused by structural asymmetry is expected to suppress carrier complexation, and the potential discontinuity at the interface contributes to the formation of interlayer excitons and thus has research implications in solar cells. Considering the good lattice match between SeWS and h-BP monolayers and the low carrier mobility of the SeWS monolayer and the high carrier mobility of the h-BP monolayer, we construct vdWHs to investigate their optoelectronic properties and electron transport performance.
Herein, SeWS (SWSe)/h-BP vdWHs were designed and their potential performance explored. The physical mechanism of the band alignment of stacked 2D SeWS (SWSe)/h-BP vdWHs has been studied in detail theoretically, and the effects of vertical electric field and biaxial strain on the band alignment transition and electronic properties have also been investigated. The SeWS (SWSe)/h-BP vdWHs have a wealth of properties in optical absorption as well as transport, and the tunable properties broaden the scope of their application. Therefore, the SeWS (SWSe)/h-BP vdWHs have potential value in multifunctional nanoelectronic and optoelectronic devices.
II. Computational methods
The calculations for the electronic structure using a first principles approach based on density functional theory (DFT) are performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).27–29 The exchange correlation potential is described using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)30 formula within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA).31 The kinetic energy cut-off is set to 550 eV, and the thickness of the vacuum spacing is set as 20 Å along the Z-direction. The k-point sampling is set to be a 9 × 9 × 1 mesh for structural relaxations. The convergence criteria for energy and force were set to be 10−6 eV and 0.005 eV Å−1, respectively. The Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) methods are commonly used in first principles calculations to correct for inaccurate PBE bandgap and band edge positions. Here, we used the HSE06 method to calculate the electronic and optical properties of heterostructures (see the ESI† for the calculation formula). The vdW interaction is considered by using the DFT-D3 method of Grimme.32 Transport properties are based on density functional theory and the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method.33,34
III. Results and discussion
A. Structure and stability
The geometric structures of h-BP and SeWS monolayers are first analyzed and optimized, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The lattice constants of the optimized SeWS and h-BP monolayers are 3.26 Å and 3.21 Å, the B–P bond length is 1.85 Å, the vertical distance of S–Se is determined to be 3.27 Å, and the bond length of W–S (W–Se) is 2.53 (2.41) Å; these calculation results are consistent with the published literature.35–41Fig. 1(a) plots the charge density difference in the SeWS layer, with charge accumulation and depletion occurring at the Se and S atoms on the surface, respectively. Charge redistribution induces the appearance of built-in electric field (Eint) of S atoms pointing towards Se atoms. These SeWS/h-BP vdWHs are formed by placing the h-BP layer vertically on the SeWS layer along the direction of the vacuum layer. The optimized lattice constants of SeWS/h-BP and SWSe/h-BP are 3.26 Å, with the lattice mismatch rate less than 1.5%, which satisfies the lattice matching requirement of vdWHs. The 2D Janus single-layer structure can be realized by replacing S atoms with Se atoms in the WS2 monolayer structure. The interface properties are derived from specific contact atoms and local configuration-sensitive stacking forms. This study considers the novel physical phenomena that appear when different faces of the double-sided SeWS contact the h-BP layer.

Blue and red denote electron accumulation and depletion, respectively. Top and side views of the SeWS/h-BP vdWHs (i) and SeWS/h-BP (ii) vdWHs with six different high-symmetry stacking models. 
The stacking of several different vdWHs was considered, as illustrated in Fig. 1 (see the ESI† for detailed descriptions). Due to the biaxial compressive strain in the SeWS (SWSe)/h-BP vdWHs, the vertical height h of S–Se in the SeWS layer is slightly smaller than the isolated SeWS (3.26–3.27 Å), as listed in Table 1. The B–P bond length of 1.85 Å in the single-layer of h-BP remains unchanged. The heterostructure binding energy Eb can be defined: Eb = Eh-BP/WSSe − Eh-BP − ESeWS(1)where Eh-BP/SeWS, Eh-BP and ESeWS are the total energy of vdWHs, intrinsic h-BP and SeWS monolayers, respectively. The binding energy of the (A, a) configuration of −0.213 (−0.225) eV is the lowest and the layer distance D is 3.279 (3.361) Å. Therefore, only type-A and type-a vdWHs are considered in the following discussion.

The dynamical stability of the vdWHs is examined by use of phonon spectra. The virtual frequency of the phonon spectrum is a confirmation of the stability of the structures, as depicted in Fig. 2(a) and (b). Using a 5 × 3 × 1 supercell containing 150 atoms for the ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation, the temperature was controlled at 300 K (room temperature), the total time was 6 ps and the time step was 1 fs. The AIMD calculations show that two vdWHs have no significant deformation and no broken bonds appear (see Fig. S1, ESI†). The total energy oscillates in a fixed value range without any sharp change (see Fig. 2(c) and (d)). Theoretically the AIMD simulation of 6 ps (or even longer) is not sufficient to prove the stability of the structure in a strict sense. From the calculation of the phonon spectrum and AIMD simulation results, the structure can be basically considered to have good stability in thermodynamics and dynamics. To obtain a better understanding of the mechanical stability, we have performed the corresponding calculations as indicated in Table S1 (ESI†). The calculation results indicated that the vdWHs have stronger resistance to elastic deformation and excellent mechanical stability. The vdWHs have perfect circularity, which means that the vdWHs have perfectly isotropic elastic properties (as seen in Fig. S2, ESI†).

B. Electronic properties
To investigate the electronic characteristics of the two vdWHs, we study the band structures of each component and their vdWHs. The bandgaps of SeWS and h-BP monolayers calculated by HSE06 (PBE) are 2.31 (1.71) eV and 1.36 (0.91) eV, which are consistent with previous studies (as shown in Fig. 3).35–41 In Fig. 3(e), the schematic representation of the SeWS/h-BP vdWHs exhibits a typical type I band alignment. The electrons and holes are spontaneously transferred from the h-BP layer to the SeWS layer, which is conducive to the compounding of excitons and reduces the exciton lifetime. As illustrated in Fig. 3(d), the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) of SWSe/h-BP vdWHs are contributed by the h-BP and SWSe layers, respectively, thus effectively reducing the exciton complexation and increasing the exciton lifetime. The band gap of vdWHs is smaller than those of the single-layer SeWS and h-BP, due to the band shift resulting from the interaction of the different layers of materials. In the design of devices with vdWHs in semiconductors, the relative band edge positions and work functions are very significant indicators.42 When different materials form vdWHs, the direction of electron flow at the interface can be determined by the potential barrier. With the formation of an interface between the h-BP layer and the SWSe (SeWS) layer, electrons flow spontaneously from the h-BP layer to the SWSe (SeWS) layer due to the larger work function of the h-BP layer. During this process, an Eint is generated from the h-BP layer towards the SWSe (SeWS) layer. The h-BP layer keeps losing electrons and the SWSe (SeWS) layer keeps gaining electrons until both Fermi energy levels (Ef) reach the same position level. The work function of the SeWS/h-BP (SWSe/h-BP) vdWHs is reduced by 0.27 (0.2) eV relative to the monolayer SWSe and increased by 0.29 (0.36) eV compared to the h-BP layer, which agrees well with other studies.43,44 The planar average electrostatic potential of the vdWHs along the Z-direction are plotted in Fig. S3 (ESI†).

The orange and rose colours indicate the contribution of the h-BP and SeWS layers, respectively. Schematic representation of the band alignment including conduction band offset Ec for the (e) SeWS/h-BP and (f) SWSe/h-BP vdWHs. 
The charge redistribution takes place in the SeWS/h-BP (SWSe/h-BP) vdWHs by the formation of electron-rich and hole-rich regions, as illustrated in Fig. 4. The visual charge redistribution can more clearly show the charge transfer mechanism. The plane average charge density difference is expressed by the expression: (2)where ρSWSe/h-BP(x,y,z), ρSWSe(x,y,z) and ρh-BP(x,y,z) are the charge densities at (x,y,z) points in the SWSe/h-BP vdWHs, SWSe and h-BP monolayers, respectively. In Fig. 4 the redistribution of charge occurs at the interface, the h-BP layer loses electrons (green area) and the SWSe layer gains electrons (red area), which further confirms that the electrons have moved from the h-BP to the SWSe layer. Compared to the SeWS layer, the charge redistribution at the interface is more obvious in the SWSe layer. Through Bader charge analysis 0.82 × 10−2 (1.35 × 10−2) electrons are transferred from the h-BP layer to SeWS (SWSe) layer. This directional movement of electrons generates an Eint directed from the h-BP layer to the SeWS layer.

The carrier mobility plays a key role in the performance of optoelectronic devices. To estimate the carrier mobility, the deformation potential theory based on Bardeen and Shockley is used.45 The calculated carrier mobilities are listed in Table 2, and the selected square cells and the first Brillouin zone are plotted in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The h-BP layer exhibits anisotropic electron and hole mobility, with electron and hole mobility capable of reaching 105 cm2 V−1 s−1. In Fig. S5 and S6 (ESI†), we illustrate the energy–strain relationships and strain induced band edge positions for individual monolayers and vdWHs. The higher electron mobility along the y-direction of the vdWHs is mainly due to the smaller effective mass of electrons in the y-direction, which is similar to the behavior of GeS/phosphorene vdWHs,46 LixBy monolayers47 and B8Si4 monolayer.48 The electron and hole mobilities along x and y directions in the SeWS layer are both isotropic, the hole mobility being as much as three times higher than electron mobility, providing a higher carrier mobility compared to other TMDS.49 For SeWS/h-BP vdWHs, the mobilities of holes and electrons are anisotropic, with the mobility of holes of 2099.324 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2361.048 cm2 V−1 s−1 along the x and y directions, respectively. The electron migration along the y direction (1745.256 cm2 V−1 s−1) is two times higher than along the x direction (814.415 cm2 V−1 s−1), indicating a greater tendency for electrons to move in the y direction. The electron mobility along the y-direction in SWSe/h-BP vdWHs (2956.779 cm2 V−1 s−1) is two times higher than along the x-direction (1418.908 cm2 V−1 s−1), while the hole mobility is 2123.304 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3292.388 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the x and y-directions, respectively. The higher carrier mobility of SWSe/h-BP compared to that of the SeWS/h-BP vdWHs is mainly due to a smaller deformation constant. The increased carrier mobility of the vdWHs in both the x and y-directions compared to the single-layer SeWS is due to the increased in-plane C2D (in-plane stiffness). The force required to achieve a certain deformation is greater in a multilayered 2D structure than in a single-layer 2D structure. The vdWHs exhibit bipolar carrier transport characteristics at room temperature, with high electron and hole migration rates greatly enhancing charge transport characteristics, and are expected to become the next generation electronic devices.

C. Effect of external electric field
The application of an external Efield to modulate the electronic properties of vdWHs is one of the most modulation methods.50,51 Here, two directions (+z, −z) along the vacuum layer are considered, with the positive direction (+z) defined as pointing from the bottom SWSe (SeWS) layer to the upper h-BP layer. The band gap of the vdWHs can be effectively modulated by the external Efield, as illustrated in Fig. 5(a) and (b). For SeWS/h-BP vdWHs, with a linear decreasing trend in bandgap values at Efield > 0.6 V Å−1, eventually the semiconductor to metal transition occurs at Efield = 1.5 V Å−1. When the Efield in the −z direction is applied, the bandgap first decreases gently and then decreases directly to zero as the Efield > −0.6 V Å−1. The bandgap of the SWSe/h-BP vdWHs exhibits a monotonic decrease with increasing Efield strength when a positive Efield is applied. With an external Efield of 0 to 1.3 V Å−1 modulation, the bandgap decreases gently and then decreases steeply to a near zero bandgap with the Efield > 1.3 V Å−1. The vdWHs have a different trend of bandgap variation in the presence of Efield, mainly arising from the influence of the Eint.
 Fig. 5  (a) and (b) The bandgaps and (c) and (d) band alignments of SeWS/h-BP and SWSe/h-BP vdWHs, as a function of Efield. The blue and white areas represent type I and type II vdWHs, respectively. 
To provide more insight into the physical mechanism of bandgap modulation by Efield, Fig. 5(c) and (d) give the band edge positions at different Efield strengths. In the Efield range from −0.6 to 0.6 V Å−1, the CBM and VBM of SeWS/h-BP vdWHs are both contributed by the h-BP layer, realising a type I band alignment. With the Efield > 0.6 V Å−1, the VBM of vdWHs becomes contributed by the SeWS layer, while the CBM is still contributed by the h-BP layer. When Efield > −0.6 V Å−1 the CBM of SeWS/h-BP vdWHs is contributed by the SeWS layer, which exhibits a type II band alignment. The SWSe/h-BP vdWHs exhibit type II band alignment with Efield strengths from −0.2 to 1.2 V Å−1, where the VBM is contributed by the SWSe layer and the CBM is contributed by the h-BP layer. With the effect of negative Efield, the band edge position of SeWS decreases linearly with increasing Efield strength, in Efield > −1.4 V Å−1 exhibiting a type II band alignment. The transition between type I and type II band alignments can occur under the modulation of external Efield. The larger Efield strengths can induce stronger hybridization between the two layers, which facilitates the use of vdWHs in nanodevices. The electron transfer between the layers of vdWHs when applying an Efield is shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). The accumulation of holes and electrons leads to relative shifts of energy levels in SeWS and h-BP layers, which results in the Efield induced modulation of band alignment.
D. Biaxial strain effects
For the practical value of the device, the tunability of the electronic properties can broaden the application of the device, with the use of strain regulation engineering being one of the effective ways. As excessive compressive strains in 2D materials may lead to atomic layer fold, we apply biaxial strains in the range from −6% to 14% to ensure that the vdWHs are not damaged. Fig. 6(a) and (b) illustrate the bandgaps as a function of biaxial strain (ε = −6 to 14%). The bandgap of vdWHs is sensitive to the biaxial strain. The band edge position relationships under biaxial strain are given in Fig. 6(c) and (d). For SeWS/h-BP vdWHs, the CBM of the SeWS layer shifts upwards and the CBM of h-BP decreases under compressive strain, while the CBM of SeWS tends to decrease linearly and the VBM increases with tensile strain. At ε = 3% tensile strain, the SeWS/h-BP vdWH CBM is contributed by the SeWS layer, the VBM is still contributed by the h-BP layer, and the SeWS/h-BP vdWHs exhibit a type II band alignment. When ε > 5%, the SeWS/h-BP vdWH VBM is contributed by the h-BP layer and the CBM remains contributed by the SeWS layer. Currently, the SeWS/h-BP vdWHs transform into a type 1 band alignment again. The SWSe/h-BP vdWHs decrease in the band edge position under the tensile strain, at ε = 6%, the CBM transforms to SWSe layer contribution and the vdWHs behave as a type I band alignment. Under compressive strain, the VBM increases and the CBM decreases in the h-BP layer, while the VBM and CBM both decrease in the SWSe layer. At ε > −2%, the SWSe/h-BP vdWHs exhibit a type II band alignment.

E. Optical properties and power conversion efficiency (PCE)
The SWSe/h-BP and SeWS/h-BP vdWHs have more absorption peaks in the visible optical range, a larger absorption range for visible optics than the intrinsic layer. The vdWHs have a certain absorption capacity near the infrared, which mainly comes from the contribution of the h-BP layer. The vdWHs have a wide range of optical absorption from the ultraviolet (UV) to the infrared (IR), and the optical absorption coefficient can reach 105, and are considered as a candidate material for future solar cells. We focused more on the absorption coefficients of the system at the visible and infrared. The h-BP and SeWS monolayers have only an absorption peak in the visible optical range from 380 nm to 500 nm and no absorption in other visible optical ranges (Fig. S8, ESI†). Fig. 7(a) and (b) indicate the optical absorption coefficient of vdWHs at various external Efield values. The vdWHs show a significant redshift at the absorption edge, which becomes more pronounced with increasing Efield strength. In the presence of an external Efield, the optical absorption intensity of the vdWHs increases and new absorption peaks appear in the visible and IR ranges. At Efield = −1.2 eV, the SWSe/h-BP vdWHs have distinct absorption peaks at 850 and 980 nm, with the visible range being only 380–550 nm, which facilitates the design of IR detectors. The Efield effectively enhances the absorption intensity of the vdWHs in the visible range, with the ability to generate new absorption peaks in the infrared range. The trends of the vdWH optical absorption coefficient with strain are illustrated in Fig. 7(c) and (d). The vdWHs exhibit a more pronounced redshift at the absorption edge under biaxial strain, and the redshift becomes more pronounced with increasing strain. The SeWS/h-BP vdWHs increase in visible optical absorption with increasing strain intensity. The biaxial strain modulated vdWHs show a distinct absorption peak near the IR. When ε = −4%, the vdWHs have a strong absorption peak at 400 nm and with little absorption in the rest of the visible range. Meanwhile, the vdWHs have a strong absorption peak near the IR, which can be used in the design of infrared detectors.
 Fig. 7  The optical absorption along the x-direction of the (a) SeWS/h-BP and (b) SWSe/h-BP vdWHs at various external Efield values, (c) SeWS/h-BP and (d) SWSe/h-BP vdWHs in various biaxial strains. 
The excellent optical absorption coefficients of vdWHs play an important role in their performance in optoelectronics and photovoltaic applications. The type II band alignment formed by the SWSe/h-BP vdWHs is potentially valuable for their application in 2D excitonic solar cells. The theoretical upper limit of power conversion efficiency (PCE) can be described using the following equation (for details see the ESI†):52 (3)The calculated PCE of the pristine SWSe/h-BP vdWHs is 4.65%, with a low conversion efficiency. However, with a PCE of 20.7% at 6% tensile strain, the current results are competitive with published reports, such as MoS2/BP (20.42%),37 phosphorene/MoS2 (∼21%)53 and MoSe2/Bas (20.08%),54 making these vdWHs extremely prospective candidates for solar energy harvesting by 2D excitonic solar cells. We propose a model for solar cells with SWSe/h-BP vdWHs in Fig. 8(b) with the SeWs layer as the acceptor material and the h-BP layer as the donor material, respectively. Once the photons are absorbed, the electron leap may occur between the donor and the acceptor.

F. Transport properties
To investigate the transport properties of the vdWHs, a two-probe model was constructed,12,55–57 as shown in Fig. 9(A) and (a). The transport properties of vdWHs are calculated stereoscopically using a simplified pseudo “device” structure, which is obtained by periodically extending the central scattering regions of the left and right pseudo electrodes. As illustrated in Fig. 9(B) and (b), the electron transmission spectra of the SeWS/h-BP and SWSe/h-BP vdWHs are similar, and they both have large gaps near the Ef, indicating that almost no current can propagate through the vdWHs at a finite bias voltage.58 Current–voltage characteristics are one of the important parameters for assessing the performance of the devices.59 To obtain the I–V curves for vdWHs, it is considered to add the bias voltage Vb = VL − VR in the pseudo-device simulation calculation, where VL/R is the bias voltage applied to the left and right electrodes, respectively. The I–V curves of the two analogue devices are demonstrated in Fig. 9(C) and (c). The SeWS(SWSe)/h-BP vdWHs pseudo-device has a threshold voltage of 0.7/0.5 V for forward and reverse bias voltages, respectively. Moreover, the magnitude of the current can reach the order of μA. The I–V curve of the SWSe/h-BP vdWHs exhibits an interesting negative differential resistance (NDR) effect with a peak-to-valley ratio of 1.12 (1.18), which is important in high frequency oscillators and analogue-to-digital converters.

IV. Conclusions
In summary, the electronic structure, optical properties and transport characteristics of SeWS (SWSe)/h-BP vdWHs are investigated by DFT calculations, and the electric field and strain engineering modulations are considered to improve the performance of SeWS (SWSe)/h-BP vdWHs. The SeWS/h-BP and SWSe/h-BP vdWHs exhibited type I band alignment and type II band alignment, respectively. With the external electric field and biaxial strain, the vdWHs are capable of undergoing a reciprocal transition from type I to type II band alignment, and both exhibit the properties of a direct bandgap semiconductor. The vdWHs have excellent anisotropic electron and hole mobilities (∼104 cm2 V−1 s−1). The higher carrier mobility of SWSe/h-BP compared to that of SeWS/h-BP vdWHs is mainly due to a smaller deformation constant. The optical absorption spectra of the vdWHs are enhanced by the external Efield and biaxial strain, and there is a significant redshift. The proper regulation of SWSe/h-BP vdWHs can lead to a tiny conduction-band offset, staggered band alignment, and suitable donor band gap; the PCE of SWSe/h-BP vdWHs can reach 20.68%, making the vdWHs highly promising in 2D excitonic solar cells. In addition, the SWSe/h-BP vdWHs have a significant NDR effect with a peak-to-valley ratio of 1.12 (1.18), which is important in high frequency oscillators, multipliers, logic, and analogue-to-digital converters. This work provides theoretical support for the potential application of vdWHs in multifunctional nanodevices.
