    AbstractIn this communication, a novel CdSe/CdS/ZnO nanowire array fabricated by a 3-step solution-based method was used as a photoanode of a quantum dot sensitized solar cell, which generated a maximum power conversion efficiency of 4.15%.
Well-aligned one-dimensional nanostructures, such as nanowire (NW) and nanotube (NT) arrays, have been widely investigated as photoelectrodes for solar energy conversion devices because they provide direct electrical pathways that ensure the rapid collection of carriers generated throughout the device,1 as well as affording high junction areas and low reflectance owing to light scattering and trapping.2 In particular, ZnO and TiO2 NWs or NTs have attracted much attention due to their well-developed synthetic methods and excellent electrical properties arising from their highly crystalline structure.3 However, these wide bandgap metal-oxides (∼3.34 eV) can only absorb and utilize radiation in the UV region of the solar spectrum. One promising solution to this impasse is to anchor narrow bandgap sensitizers such as organic dyes4 or inorganic semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) onto the wide bandgap nanomaterials in order to enhance light harvesting in the visible 400–800 nm region, which encompasses much of the wavelength range of the incident solar flux. Compared to organic dyes, the use of inorganic QDs has several advantages such as higher light absorption5 and tailoring of optical absorption over a wider wavelength range.6 Various QDs, such as CdSe,7–9 CdS,10,11 PbS12 and InP,13 have been tested for quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs). In our previous reports, CdS sensitized ZnO NW arrays were fabricated through a solution method and applied as photoanodes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells.11 However, it was measured in three electrode configurations, and also, the bandgap of CdS (2.4 eV) is still rather high, confining its light absorption only in the region below 550 nm. The solar energy conversion can be further enhanced by application of the more efficient photoanode system, which consists of lower bandgap sensitizers, band engineered structure, and passivation functioning layers.
In the present study, we fabricated CdSe nanoparticle (NP) sensitized ZnO/CdS core/shell NW arrays and investigated their suitability for use as photoanodes in QDSSCs. The CdS shell layer also acts as a co-sensitizer in our QDSSCs. Compared with 1-D TiO2 nanostructures14,15 which have recombination problems derived from the lack of a depletion layer on the TiO2 surface, ZnO NW has higher electron mobility (205–1000 cm2 V s−1 for ZnO and 0.1–4 cm2 V s−1 for TiO2) and also reduced recombination loss.3,16 In addition, ZnO NW arrays can be fabricated using a facile template-free growth method with no requirements of the high temperature calcination.17 In the system studied, the CdS shell grown on ZnO acts as a good interfacial layer between the CdSe NPs and the ZnO NW for effective charge carrier transport, and the narrow bandgap CdSe NPs expand the light absorption range.
Arrays of ZnO NW were grown on FTO glass substrates (13 Ω/sq.) by an ammonia solution method, which was extensively described in our previous report.18 A CdS shell layer was deposited on the ZnO NW by successive ion layer absorption and reaction (SILAR).11 The ZnO NW arrays were dipped in 100 mM CdSO4 aq and subsequently in 100 mM Na2S aq at room temperature. The CdS shell thickness could be controlled digitally by changing the number of reaction cycles. Then, CdSe NPs were deposited on the ZnO/CdS core/shell NW structure using chemical bath deposition (CBD). For the nucleation and growth of CdSe NPs, NW arrays were immersed in an aqueous solution containing Cd(CH3COO)2:Na2SeSO3:NH4OH = 2.5 mM:2.5 mM:45 mM at the solution temperature of 95 °C. The sizes of CdSe NPs were controlled by CBD reaction durations.

Fig. 1(a) and (b) show typical scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the as-grown ZnO NW array and the CdSe/CdS/ZnO NW array, respectively. A high density and well-aligned NW array was grown on the substrate with a diameter of around 100 nm, and the deposition of CdSe/CdS shell on the NW caused it to become thicker and to have a rougher surface. The detailed structure of a single NW was elucidated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM; Fig. 1(c)). The TEM image clearly shows that the CdS shell and additional CdSe NPs were uniformly deposited on the ZnO NW. Moreover, high resolution TEM (Fig. 1(d)) disclosed that a CdS shell layer of average thickness ∼6 nm was grown on the single crystal ZnO NW, and that highly crystalline CdSe NPs were deposited on the core/shell NW. Polycrystalline CdSe NPs with average diameters of ∼6.5 nm were found to be uniformly dispersed on the NW.

The optical absorption spectra of three NW samples are shown in Fig. 2. Compared with ZnO NW array, the deposition of CdS shell shifts the light absorption edge to higher wavelength. Additional CdSe NPs extend the absorption range to even higher wavelength. These results indicate that the CdSe/CdS shell enhances the light absorption in almost the entire visible-light region and so can act as co-sensitizers in QDSSCs. The absorption edge of each sample was estimated from the intersection point of two fitting lines, the saturation and inclined lines.11 The absorption edge values obtained for three samples nearly matched their bandgaps: 380 nm (3.27 eV) for ZnO (3.34 eV), 530 nm (2.35 eV) for CdS (2.4 eV), and 700 nm (1.77 eV) for CdSe (1.7 eV). The insets in Fig. 2 show photographs of the corresponding samples. The sample color changed from gray for the bare ZnO NWs, to orange after deposition of CdS shell, and then to dark red following deposition of CdSe NPs.

Next we assessed the photovoltaic performances of QDSSCs in which CdSe/CdS/ZnO NW arrays, Au-coated FTO substrates, and polysulfide redox couple19 were used as the photoanodes, counter electrodes, and electrolyte respectively.
The detailed cell fabrication is described in the ESI.† In fabrication of QDSSCs, a polysulfide electrolyte is suitable because a typical polyiodide electrolyte which has ideal kinetic properties in dye sensitized solar cells is corrosive to semiconductor QDs.19 In addition, Au shows better performances as a counter electrode compared to Pt when the polysulfide electrolyte is used.8,20 Then the photovoltaic performance was measured under an illumination of a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel class A, 92251A) at one sun (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2), with an active area of 0.25 cm2 which was accurately defined using a mask. The best performance has been achieved when we used a CdSe/CdS/ZnO NW photoanode consisting of 10 nm thick CdS shell and 6.5 nm thick CdSe NPs layer. Fig. 3 shows the typical photocurrent density (J) versus potential (V) curves for QDSSCs fabricated with three different NW samples; CdSe/ZnO, CdS/ZnO, and CdSe/CdS/ZnO NW arrays. The photovoltaic measurement results from various NW samples are summarized in Table 1. For the cell based on the bare ZnO NW array, open-circuit voltage (Voc) was 25.5 mV and short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) was 0.16 mA cm−2. The deposition of CdSe NPs on the ZnO NW array significantly increased Voc and Jsc to 191 mV and 2.4 mA cm−2, and the deposition of CdS shell on the ZnO NW array drastically enhanced Voc and Jsc to 576 mV and 5.7 mA cm−2, respectively. This is owing to the broader light absorption range of CdS/ZnO NW and CdSe/ZnO NW than that of the bare ZnO NW array. Moreover, the SILAR-CdS shell has a higher conformal layer and better interface with ZnO NW compared to the CBD-CdSe NP layer.9 Thus the CdS shell could effectively promote the charge collection and reduce the recombination losses between the bare ZnO NW and electrolyte, which produces better photovoltaic performances than the CdSe/ZnO NW. Finally, when a CdSe NPs deposited ZnO/CdS core/shell NW array was applied as the photoanode, Voc of 627 mV and Jsc of 17.3 mA cm−2 were attained, and the maximum power conversion efficiency of 4.15% was achieved.

To confirm the beneficial effects obtained from the addition of CdSe NPs to the CdS/ZnO NW, we measured the incident photon to current conversion efficiencies (IPCE). Shown in Fig. 4 are IPCE spectra of the CdSe/CdS/ZnO NW and the CdS/ZnO NW. The results were consistent with the corresponding optical absorption spectra shown in Fig. 2. Up to 550 nm, the CdSe/CdS/ZnO NW array has slightly higher IPCE than the CdS/ZnO NW array due to the enhanced light harvest from additional CdSe NP layer, and it shows that the CdS interlayer does not interrupt the transport of photoelectrons from CdSe to ZnO NW. Above 550 nm, although only CdSe NPs can generate the photoelectrons in this light wavelength range, a somewhat higher IPCE was obtained up to around 700 nm. These results implied that the CdS interlayer promotes the charge transport from CdSe to ZnO NW, which generated a maximum 70% IPCE value. As a result, the deposition of CdSe on CdS/ZnO NW could improve the short-circuit current from 5.7 mA cm−2 to 17.3 mA cm−2.

Scheme 1 shows a schematic diagram of the CdSe/CdS/ZnO NW and its band gap alignment. According to the literature,21 the relative band edges of bulk CdSe and CdS show a type-I band structure. However, when CdS and CdSe are brought into contact as a cascade band structure, the band edges are rearranged due to electron transfer from CdS to CdSe, a process known as Fermi level alignment.8 Furthermore, the S2−/Sx2− redox couple shifts the conduction band energies of CdSe NPs, when in contact with them, toward negative potentials.22 Thus, the CdSe/CdS/ZnO device can have a stepwise type-II band structure. Due to this band structure, the photogenerated charge carriers will be readily separated and efficiently transferred. In addition, the CdS interlayer is able to act as a passivation layer to inhibit the recombination of percolated electrons in the ZnO NWs and oxidizing species in the electrolyte. This was confirmed by the observation of a higher Voc value for the CdSe/CdS/ZnO NWs than for the CdSe/ZnO NWs with no CdS interlayer.

In summary, CdSe NP sensitized ZnO/CdS core/shell NW arrays were fabricated using a facile solution-based method. As a sensitizer scaffold, the NW array structure provides a direct electron pathway to the bottom metal electrode over a large surface area; and as co-sensitizers, the CdSe/CdS shell provides enhanced light absorption and charge-carrier transfer efficiency. Another important role of the CdS interlayer is passivation of ZnO NWs to reduce charge recombination. As a result, QDSSCs based on CdSe/CdS/ZnO NW arrays exhibited considerably improved performance, with 4.15% of a power conversion efficiency and about 70% IPCE at its maximum, compared to previously reported QDSSCs.7,10
