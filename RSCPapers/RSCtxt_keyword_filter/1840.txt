    , Accepted 2nd January 2018First published on 2nd January 2018AbstractAs the long-term stability and toxicity of Pb are two profound concerns for the commercialization of Pb-based perovskite solar cells, we have undertaken this study to understand the performance degradation of perovskite solar cells at high temperature (60, 80, 100 and 120 °C) and under a humid (30–50% relative humidity) environment, and then tried to reuse the perovskite films from the degraded cells to recover the cell efficiency so as to avoid dumping of Pb-waste into the environment. As found in this study, the performance of MAPbI3 (MA = CH3NH3) cells using spiro-OMeTAD as the hole transport material (HTM) deteriorated mainly not due to the degradation of the perovskite but because of the modification of the interface between the perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD at high temperature. In addition, the spiro-OMeTAD layer underwent a severe morphological deformation at high temperature, showing large voids in it, which reduced the cell performance further. However, despite the complete reconversion of PbI2 to perovskite and the replacement of the degraded spiro-OMeTAD film with a fresh layer in the MAPbI3 cells, the cell performance was not recovered to the initial value because the modified perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface became worse after recycling. The thermal stability and performance recovery upon recycling were found to depend on the composition of the perovskite; faster degradation of MAPbI3 cells with a slight excess of MAI and better stability of cells not containing MA (FA0.85Cs0.15PbI3, FA = CH(NH2)2) indicated certain involvement of MA+ ions in the alteration of the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface. Unlike the heat-treatment case, MAPbI3 cells, when exposed to a humid environment, degraded significantly to PbI2 and the reconversion of this PbI2 to perovskite followed by deposition of a fresh spiro-OMeTAD layer increased the cell performance but it did not recover to the initial value. This poor recovery in these cells was due to inefficient carrier transport that resulted in a lower photocurrent in the recycled devices.
1. Introduction
Owing to their magnificent optoelectronic properties and through extensive efforts put into the fabrication of devices with high quality perovskite films, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells1 have made incredibly fast progress in power conversion efficiency (PCE), which, as achieved in laboratories, has recently gone beyond 22%.2 In less than a decade, the new photovoltaic technology has emerged with immense potential to be the cheapest alternative to the present commercially available photovoltaic technologies. However, despite an expeditious rise in their efficiency, organolead halide perovskite based solar cells are still far from commercialization because of two major challenges: inadequate stability3,4 and toxicity of Pb.5,6 Sincere and urgent efforts are required to address these two issues for making the new technology a commercial success. While a few studies7–10 have shown impressive results regarding long term stability, a large number of studies3,11–15 have directly or indirectly disclosed and discussed the facts of both material and performance instability in perovskite solar cells. Although easy degradation of perovskites (MAPbI3, etc.) in an ambient environment with high relative humidity is considered to be a big problem for commercialization, reversible/temporal changes in cell performance16,17 observed in perovskite devices are also discouraging. Continuous degradation in performance under light,18 which is often a reversible effect, is possibly due to temporary electrical changes at the interfaces. There are various mechanisms that have been proposed to explain such reversible/temporal changes in the cell performance of perovskite solar cells. Besides the perovskite, the HTM and additives in the HTM have also been found responsible for performance degradation. It has been observed that the perovskite is quite stable under dry conditions and at temperature up to 85 °C, showing apparently no change in absorption spectra.19 Performance degradation without any change in the perovskite has been found to be due to either crystallization19 or photo-oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD,20 or diffusion of Au into spiro-OMeTAD21 or change in the electron collecting layer. Hence, the stability of perovskite solar cells needs further development.
Recently, a great amount of effort has also been made to replace toxic Pb with less toxic Sn22,23 and Bi24,25 but none of these perovskite compounds have shown promising potential in terms of efficiency. Unfortunately, “lead” leads in terms of efficiency. Moreover, Sn is also not necessarily less toxic than Pb.6 In such a case, a wise and alternative approach would be to find ways that can prevent Pb from getting into the environment instead of replacing the metal. One idea to minimize the chances of Pb exposure is to reuse/recycle the perovskite. Not to mention, increasing the life of lead-based device is primarily important. If the origin of device degradation is not perovskite itself but other elements, device life can be extended by replacing the degraded elements. Interestingly, the successful recycling of perovskite devices has been reported in a few studies recently. Kim et al.,26 Andreas et al.,27 and Jeannette et al.,28 in their independent reports, have shown the selective dissolution of the HTM and perovskite, and the reuse of the cleaned electron transport layer (ETL)-coated FTO substrate and the PbI2 precursor obtained from the degraded device. However, it could be more interesting if they had tried to reuse the perovskite film without dissolving it to obtain the PbI2 precursor. There are several reports showing that the performance degradation is related to the HTM while the perovskite does not change if the device is not exposed to humid conditions. Even if the perovskite is degraded, the formed PbI2 can be easily reconverted to perovskite by treating it with methylammonium iodide (MAI) solution. In fact, It has been recently reported that the treatment of a degraded perovskite film (without the HTM layer) with MAI solution can reconvert the PbI2 to perovskite and the latter, when used in the device, could work but with a lower efficiency compared to the initial device.29 It has been also observed that the properties of spiro-OMeTAD and thus the cell performance can degrade with aging at high temperature and the replacement of the aged spiro-OMeTAD with a fresh layer has been found to recover the cell performance.30 Thus, the aim of our work is to reuse the perovskite film obtained from devices that have been subjected to different degradation conditions, such as high humidity and high temperature. Planar perovskite (MAPbI3) solar cells using spiro-OMeTAD as the hole transport layer were aged under dry (<10% relative humidity) and ambient (RH varying between 30% and 50% humidity) conditions and were also heated deliberately at different temperatures (60, 80, 100 and 120 °C) for 1 hour to degrade the cell performance. The performance degradation was thoroughly investigated by current–voltage (I–V), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization. Then, the perovskite films from these devices were recovered, examined and reused either after some treatment or without any treatment depending on degradation. The results showed that degradation in cell performance was largely caused by chemical/electrical changes occurring in the spiro-OMeTAD and at the interface between the perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD while the perovskite film remained almost unaffected by storing under dry conditions and heating up to 80 °C. The study also provides insights into changes occurring at the interface of the perovskite and HTM when the cells are degraded either at high temperature or in a humid atmosphere.
2. Experimental
2.1 Device fabrication

MAPbI3 solar cells. 
Planar heterojunction solar cells using methylammonium lead trihalide (CH3NH3PbI3) perovskite as absorber, TiO2 compact layer as the ETL and spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM were fabricated by a solution method. First, FTO substrates were cleaned with soap solution (Hellmanex™) followed by acetone and finally with distilled water. A TiO2 compact layer of ∼50 nm thickness was prepared by spin-coating (3000 rpm × 30 s) a diluted solution of titanium diisopropoxide bis (acetylacetonate) (i.e. [Ti(acac)2(iPrO)2]) (75 wt%, Aldrich) in ethanol (100 μl Ti(acac) + 1 ml EtOH) two times with 10 min of drying at 120 °C between the first and the second coating. Then, the precursor coated FTO substrates were dried at 120 °C again for 10 min before sintering them at 500 °C for 1 h in a muffle furnace. These substrates were then subjected to UV–ozone treatment for 10 min before the perovskite precursor solution (1 M PbI2 and 1 M MAI in DMF and DMSO mixed solvent) was coated on it. A mixed solution of 1 M PbI2 (Tokyo Chemical Industry) and 1 M MAI (Tokyo Chemical Industry) was prepared by mixing them in a mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO (3:1 v/v). The perovskite film was made by spin-coating the precursor solution at 6000 rpm for 25 s with dripping 1 ml of chlorobenzene just 5 s before the spin-coating was stopped. The precursor coated substrates were then annealed at 100 °C on a hot plate for 1 h to crystallize MAPbI3. As measured from the cross-sectional SEM image, the thickness of the perovskite film was 230–250 nm. After annealing and cooling the perovskite films to room temperature, a 12 wt% solution of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD, from Merck) including lithium bis(trifluoromethylsyfonyl) imide salt (Li-TFSI) and tert-butylpyridine (t-BP) as the dopant and additive respectively in chlorobenzene was coated at a spinning speed of 4000 rpm for 30 s. The spiro-OMeTAD layer was aged overnight under dry and dark conditions to promote oxidation and finally, a gold contact was thermally evaporated onto the spiro-OMeTAD.


FA0.85Cs0.15PbI3 solar cells. 
A FTO glass substrate was washed with EtOH, Hellmanex™ (2%), and deionized water by ultrasonic treatment for 15 min each. A TiO2 compact layer (CL) was prepared by a spin-coating method. The cleaned FTO substrate was treated with a UV–ozone cleaner. Then, 0.15 M [Ti(acac)2(iPrO)2] in IPA was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s and dried at 100 °C for 5 min. The substrate was cooled down, and similar operation was carried out twice using 0.3 M [Ti(acac)2(iPrO)2] solution followed by the first coating. The substrate was then sintered in a muffle furnace at 500 °C for 15 min. A brookite TiO2 colloidal suspension in EtOH (1:18, v/v) was casted onto the TiO2 CL and spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 40 s. The substrate was dried at 70 °C for 2 min and then annealed at 150 °C for 1 h. A 1.2 M solution of formamidinium iodide (FAI), CsI, and PbI2 (0.85:0.15:1 in mol) in DMF and DMSO (4:1 v/v) was stirred at 70 °C for 1 h.
Before the preparation of the perovskite film, the precursor solution and the UV–O3-treated TiO2 mesoporous substrates were warmed at 70 °C. The precursor solution was poured onto the TiO2 mesoporous substrate and spin-coated (kept for 60 s, 3000 rpm for 50 s, and 6000 rpm for 30 s with chlorobenzene). The as-prepared film was annealed with a PR-VA technique31 at 130 °C for 10 min.
An HTM solution was prepared as follows: spiro-OMeTAD was dissolved in chlorobenzene (70 mM) and stirred at 70 °C for 1 h. The solution was cooled to r.t., and t-BP (0.231 M), a stock solution of LiTFSI (0.035 M) in acetonitrile, and a stock solution of FK209 PF6 salt (0.002 M) in acetonitrile were added as additives and oxidizing agents (molar ratio, 1:3.3:0.5:0.03). On the perovskite films, the HTM solution was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s and the prepared cell was kept under dry and dark conditions overnight to promote oxidation.32,33 Finally, gold was deposited on the HTL as a counter electrode.

2.2 Device degradation
In order to cause degradation, the non-encapsulated devices were either stored in a dry (10% humidity) or in a humid (30–50% humidity) atmosphere, or heated at 60 °C, 80 °C, 100 °C, and 120 °C for 1 h. The performance of the cells before and after degradation was measured. After the measurement, the cells were used for recycling.
2.3 Recycling
For recycling, the devices were dipped in chlorobenzene for 10 min, which was repeated 3 times. Then, they were spin-washed 3 times. The Au layer came off as the spiro-OMeTAD layer started dissolving in chlorobenzene. After washing off the spiro-OMeTAD layer, the films were spin-washed (dripping 1 ml of chlorobenzene while the substrate was spinning at 4000 rpm) with chlorobenzene 6 times. Then, the films were heated at 80 °C for 15 min. In the cases where the perovskite was degraded to PbI2, the perovskite film was treated with MAI solution (60 mM in isopropanol) by spin-coating the MAI solution on the degraded perovskite films, rinsing off excess MAI and finally heating them at 80 °C for 15 min. Then, a fresh spiro-OMeTAD layer was coated under the same conditions as before the cells were subjected to degradation methods. After aging the spiro-OMeTAD overnight, an Au contact was evaporated to complete the device again.
2.4 Device characterization
Photovoltaic characterization of the devices was done by measuring current at different voltages scanned in both forward (from −0.1 V to 1.2 V) and backward (from 1.2 V to −0.1 V) directions, both under light (100 mW cm−2, AM1.5, 1 sun intensity) provided by a solar simulator (Peccell Technologies PEC-L01) and in the dark. A Keithley source meter (Model 2400) was used for all electrical measurements. The voltage scan speed used to obtain photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves was kept at 200 mV s−1. The active area of the device was 0.09 cm2. For steady state current measurement, current from the cells was measured for more than 2 min either at a bias voltage equal to voltage corresponding to the maximum power point (determined from the current–voltage (I–V) scan). The X-ray diffraction pattern of the perovskite was obtained with a Bruker Model D8 Discover XRD machine before and after cell degradation and after recycling. SEM microscopy (SU8000, HITACHI) was used to determine the film morphology and thickness of the layers in the device. EIS (Solartron SI 1260) was used to get information about the interfacial charge transfer and carrier recombination. EIS spectra of the cells were measured in the dark while biasing them with a DC voltage of 0.9 and 1.0 V (close to the open circuit voltage) superposed with an AC voltage of 10 mV with frequency varying from 106 Hz to 0.1 Hz. Note that all the measurements were taken on non-encapsulated cells in an ambient atmosphere (30–40% humidity) and at room temperature.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Role of spiro-OMeTAD in performance degradation
As we have reported in our earlier study,34 the performance of the MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells decreased after heating the devices at different temperatures (60, 80, 100 and 120 °C) and the drop in the cell efficiency was mainly due to reduction in the fill factor (FF) while the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) decreased slightly (Fig. 1). Although the performance decreased remarkably, the perovskite remained unaffected till 80 °C and degraded insignificantly to PbI2 at 100 and 120 °C. Instead, the spiro-OMeTAD layer underwent severe morphological deformation; large voids emerged in the spiro-OMeTAD layer at high temperatures and only at places where the HTM was capped with the Au film.34

Corresponding forward scan PCE, Jsc, Voc and FF values, and a set of representative J–V curves are given in Fig. S1 and S2† respectively. 
In order to confirm the role of the degraded perovskite (PbI2) in performance deterioration and to differentiate its contribution from the effect of deformed spiro-OMeTAD and the suspected chemically altered interface between the perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD in the heated cells, we intentionally degraded the perovskite film by over-heating (at 60, 80, 100 and 120 °C for 1 h) before coating the spiro-OMeTAD and compared their performance with the ones that were heated along with spiro-OMeTAD (in the complete cell and in the device before Au film deposition). In addition, we also compared the performance of cells with traces of PbI2 that remained from the excess of PbI2 used in the precursor solution (1.1 M PbI2:1 M MAI). A schematic diagram showing the different processes adopted to create PbI2 in the perovskite is given in Fig. 2. As can be seen in Fig. 3b, the performance of devices made of perovskite films, which were intentionally overheated to create PbI2 (XRD is given in Fig. S3 in the ESI†), was found to be the same (16–17%) as that of the device with the perovskite (not overheated) without PbI2. In addition, the cells with excess of PbI2 remaining from the precursors also showed the same or slightly better performance than the cells without PbI2 (Fig. S3†). In contrast, the performance degraded (Fig. 3a and c) only when the perovskite film was heated along with the spiro-OMeTAD layer on top of it (with and without the Au film coated on spiro-OMeTAD), confirming the active involvement of spiro-OMeTAD in performance deterioration. Therefore, as is evident here, not the degraded perovskite but the deformation of spiro-OMeTAD and/or chemical modification at the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface must be responsible for the drop in the performance of the heated devices. Even though there were no voids in the cells heated without the Au contact (SEM micrographs are shown in Fig. S5 in the ESI†), the performance of the cells degraded to almost the same extent (Fig. 3c) as was observed for cells that were heated after Au deposition and thus had large voids in the HTM. These results, in fact, confirmed that the drop in cell efficiency in the heated MAPbI3 solar cells was essentially due to some chemical modification at the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface while the voids in the spiro-OMeTAD must have made it worse that resulted in further lower performance and wider distribution in the performance of the cells (Fig. 3a).
 Fig. 2  Schematic diagrams showing different methods used to create PbI2 (yellow dots represent PbI2) in the perovskite film and the changes that occur in spiro-OMeTAD (white spheres represent voids) and at the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface (the green stars represent some modification at the interface). 
 Fig. 3  PCE (backward scan) of planar MAPbI3 solar cells heated at 0, 60, 80, 100 and 120 °C for 1 h (a) after the deposition of the Au electrode (complete cell with the Au film: FTO/c-TiO2/MAPbI3/spiro-OMeATD/Au), (b) before spiro-OMeTAD and Au deposition (FTO/c-TiO2/MAPbI3) and (c) before Au film deposition (incomplete cells without the Au film: FTO/c-TiO2/MAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD). 
As is evident from photovoltaic characteristics (Fig. 1), the PCE of the heat-treated cells decreased mainly due to a remarkable drop in the FF. The reduced FF of the cells indicated enhanced recombination, which was also evident from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results. EIS of the cells before and after heat treatment, presented as Nyquist and Bode plots in Fig. 4a and b respectively, showed reduction in the size of the arc appearing in the intermediate frequency range (105–104 Hz). This semicircle in the mid-frequency range essentially corresponds to recombination35,36 at the TiO2/perovskite and/or the perovskite/HTM interface. In comparison to the device that was not heated, the cells heated at 60 °C and 80 °C did not show any appreciable difference in the size of the semicircle whereas the devices heated at 100 °C and 120 °C displayed a remarkable reduction in the size and hence the charge transfer resistance. Especially, in the case of 120 °C, the mid-frequency semicircle was dramatically smaller and therefore, the high-frequency semicircle, which was hidden in all other cases, became more distinguishable. The Bode plot (Fig. 4b) shows two peaks corresponding to these high and mid-frequency semicircles. Such reduction in charge transfer resistance must be responsible for the enhanced recombination (or lowering of shunt resistance) at the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface, which eventually resulted in a lower FF in the cells.

EIS spectra of the cells were taken in the dark at a DC bias voltage of 0.9 V that was superposed with an AC voltage of 10 mV with frequency varying from 106 Hz to 0.1 Hz. 
3.2 Reuse of degraded MAPbI3
As the performance deterioration in the MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells at high temperature was mainly due to chemical changes at the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface and deformation of spiro-OMeTAD, we made attempts to recover the cell performance by reusing the perovskite film with/without any surface treatment. In the cases where the perovskite remained unaffected (aging under dry conditions or heating up to 80 °C), the perovskite was not given any treatment before replacing the degraded spiro-OMeTAD layer with a fresh film. In other cases where the perovskite was degraded by heating at higher temperature (100 and 120 °C), the perovskite films, after washing off the aged/degraded spiro-OMeTAD layer, were treated with MAI solution in iso-propyl alcohol (IPA) to reconvert the PbI2 to perovskite. Then, a fresh spiro-OMeTAD layer was deposited on them to check the performance recovery. Details about the method of recycling (washing and replacing the spiro-OMeTAD layer) are given in ESI.†

Fig. 5 shows the XRD patterns of the perovskite before and after recycling the devices that were heated at different temperatures. After replacing the aged/degraded spiro-OMeTAD layer, the XRD patterns of the perovskite in the cell that was not heated or heated up to 80 °C, remained almost the same, ensuring no change in the perovskite during washing of the spiro-OMeTAD layer with chlorobenzene. The disappearance of the PbI2 peak (Fig. 5b) by MAI treatment of perovskite cells that were heated at 100 and 120 °C confirmed the reconversion of PbI2 to perovskite. However, contrary to our anticipation, the performance of the cells did not recover to the initial values (Fig. 6). Instead, the Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE of the recycled devices were lower than those of the initial (fresh) and heat-treated devices, except for the 120 °C heating case where the cell efficiency improved slightly after recycling.

Corresponding forward scan PCE, Jsc, Voc and FF and a set of J–V curves are given in Fig. S7 and S8 respectively.† 
Even for the cell that was not heated, the performance reduced after recycling. This led us to doubt the recycling method; the surface of the perovskite film was either not cleaned perfectly or altered compositionally during the process. First, in order to know if the change on the perovskite surface in the recycled cells was caused by the recycling method regardless of the external conditions during J–V measurement (light, electric field, and/or heat under illumination), a set of cells were recycled without aging or exposing them to usual measurement conditions (light and electric field). Fig. 7 shows the performance comparison of cells recycled before and after exposure to external conditions. The cells recycled without exposure to external conditions performed with an efficiency (above 16%) matching with that of the cells not recycled (initial performance of freshly prepared cells) while the cells recycled after exposure to external conditions showed a lower efficiency (14–15%). This confirmed that the change on the perovskite surface that occurred during the recycling process was due to some unknown modification at the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD that occurred in the cells due to their exposure to external conditions (light and electric field during measurement and/or heat under illumination). Among all the recycled samples, the device that was not heated showed better recovery than the heated devices (Fig. 7).
 Fig. 7  PCE of MAPbI3 solar cells before and after recycling. One set of cells (in red) were recycled after exposing the cells to external conditions like light and electric field (during J–V measurement) and the other set of cells (in purple) were recycled without exposing the cells to external conditions. FS: forward scan; BS: backward scan. 
The performance of the recycled devices was low essentially due to a drastic drop in the FF. The FF calculated from the backward scan J–V curves was significantly lower (dropped by 15%) while Jsc and Voc decreased by 1% and 5% respectively. Moreover, all the recycled devices exhibited greater hysteresis in the J–V curves (Fig. S8 in the ESI†). The FF calculated from the forward scan J–V curves (Fig. S7 in the ESI†) varied between 0.3 and 0.4, which was remarkably low in comparison to that of the fresh devices (0.6–0.65). The J–V curves (Fig. S8 in the ESI†) of the recycled cells evidenced a significantly low shunt resistance, which was suspected to be due to some change on the perovskite surface or at the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface in the recycled device. However, the devices showed neither residual HTM on the surface (SEM top surface, Fig. 8) nor any visible physical micro- or macro-defects in the layers or at the interfaces (cross-sectional SEM images in Fig. S9†). Compositional analysis of the perovskite films after washing off the spiro-OMeTAD layer, as done by Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX), consistently showed 1 to 3 atomic ratios of Pb to I (Table 1). This evidenced no loss of iodine, which was suspected to migrate into spiro-OMeTAD14 over aging or during heating. This made us doubt that the possible change might involve MA+ ions instead of iodine or Pb.

3.3 Dependence of perovskite composition on performance degradation and recovery
In order to check whether MA+ ions play any role in modifying the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface and subsequently the surface composition of the MAPbI3 perovskite film in the recycled devices, perovskite films with a slight excess of MA (i.e. 1 M PbI2:1.1 M CH3NH3I) and PbI2 (i.e. 1.1 M PbI2:1 M CH3NH3I) were prepared and treated in the same way. The performance degradation and recovery of MAPbI3 cells with a slight excess of MAI and PbI2, and stoichiometric amounts of PbI2 and MAI are given in Fig. 9. It was interesting to find that the performance of the devices with a slight excess of MA degraded dramatically (from 15% to 11%), way below what was observed for the perovskite with stoichiometric amounts of PbI2 and MAI (i.e. 1 M PbI2:1 M CH3NH3I) after heating (100 °C) (from 16% to 14%), and recovered better after recycling (from 11% to > 14%). On the other hand, the perovskite with a slight excess of PbI2 (i.e. 1.1 M PbI2:1 M CH3NH3I) showed a slightly better stability to temperature but the stability became worse after recycling (decreased from 16% to 11%). The results strongly indicated that MA+ ions are certainly involved in performance degradation, possibly modifying the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface by migrating into spiro-OMeTAD. In fact, while we were observing these results in our lab, Zhao et al.37 reported the migration of MA+ ions into spiro-OMeTAD, which was evident from time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry results.

(b) PCE (backward scan) of MAPbI3 solar cells with stoichiometric amounts of PbI2 and MAI (1 M PbI2:1 M MAI), a slight excess of PbI2 (1.1 M PbI2:1 M MAI) and a slight excess of MAI (1 M PbI2:1.1 M MAI) before heating, after heating at 100 °C for 1 h and after recycling. 
Having observed these results suggesting certain participation of MA+ ions in modifying the interface, we extended our study to perovskites containing different cations, like FA+ and Cs+, to check if they show performance degradation and recovery different from that of MAPbI3. Some preliminary results show that FA0.85Cs0.15PbI3 cells (not exactly the same architecture of MAPbI3 cells) are more stable to heat and demonstrate better recovery in performance after recycling (Fig. S11†). Even though it is not fair to compare these results directly with the MAPbI3 cells as they use two different compact layers, which is unlikely to be involved in performance degradation (Fig. 3b), it is indicative of the fact that certain composition of the perovskite can be more stable to heat and can be reused with possibly better recovered performance. Further investigation and more understanding about the changes occurring at the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface for different perovskite compositions will help us find a more stable perovskite for spiro-OMeTAD based cells. It seems that a slight excess of PbI2 and less organic cations (MA or FA) can improve the thermal stability of the cells.
3.4 Degradation due to moisture and recovery
Unlike the cases where the MAPbI3 perovskite cells were heated, exposure of the cells to humid atmospheric conditions (at RT) had a strong impact on the perovskite. As observed in our study, the cells (non-encapsulated) stored in an open atmosphere in the lab (RH varying between 30 and 50%) for 15 days exhibited substantial degradation of the perovskite to PbI2 and consequently, a dramatic drop in the cell performance. The XRD patterns and photovoltaic characteristics of the cells before and after degradation are given in Fig. 10 and 11 respectively. As can be seen from Fig. 12, unlike the heat-treatment cases (Fig. 1), in the cells exposed to humid conditions, Jsc decreased significantly in addition to FF and Voc. The decrease in photocurrent was due to an expected drop in light absorption as the perovskite degraded to PbI2 (Fig. 10) significantly. The formation of PbI2 in the perovskite film was expected to increase the film resistance and thus, decreased FF, which was also evident from the EIS of the cells. The semicircle corresponding to charge transfer at the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface was remarkably larger in size for the degraded cell. An increase in this interfacial resistance also prevents recombination when the cell is in open circuit and that was the reason why the Voc did not drop as much as Jsc and FF did. The dark current also supports the fact of increase in resistance and no change in recombination.

Forward scan PCE, Jsc, Voc and FF are given in Fig. S10.† 
 Fig. 12  (a) Nyquist and (b) Bode plots of the planar MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells before and after aging in an ambient humid atmosphere (30–50% relative humidity) and after recycling. EIS spectra of the cells were taken in the dark at a DC bias voltage of 0.9 V that was superposed with an AC voltage of 10 mV with frequency varying from 106 Hz to 0.1 Hz. 
The degraded perovskite film was treated with MAI solution after washing off the spiro-OMeTAD to convert the formed PbI2 to MAPbI3. From the XRD patterns (Fig. 10), it was evident that all the PbI2 reconverted to perovskite after MAI treatment. The PCE (backward scan) of the cells increased from 8–10% for the degraded cell to 12% in the recycled devices but it was significantly lower than the initial values (above 16%). Despite the complete reconversion of PbI2 to perovskite, the photocurrent of the recycled cells did not recover to the initial values and remained slightly higher than that of the degraded cells. Voc and FF also improved slightly but remained lower than the initial values. Importantly, the hysteresis in the J–V curves increased after recycling. The FF measured in the forward scan was slightly less than that of the degraded cell (Fig. S13†), indicating enhanced recombination in the recycled devices. The Nyquist plots of the recycled cells, presented in Fig. 12, displayed a smaller arc in the mid frequency range, which implied enhanced recombination in the recycled devices. However, the main reason for the lower performance of aged and recycled cells was significantly lower photocurrent, which must be more related to charge carrier extraction or transport and less dependent on recombination. The cross-sectional SEM micrographs (Fig. S14 in the ESI†) of the recycled cells showed a broken morphology at a few places. Hence, we suspect that inefficient charge extraction or transport can be due to either the broken morphology of the perovskite, or the excess of MAI remaining from treatment, or the hydrated complex of PbI2 that did not convert to the perovskite.
Even though the cell performance of most of the cells studied here did not recover 100%, the results specified that the chemical modification of the interface between the perovskite and HTM, which strongly depends on the cation part of the perovskite, is the reason for performance degradation and subsequently lower performance of the recycled cells. In addition, the recycling method used here is believed not to be perfect and needs to be optimized further, possibly in specific ways for different perovskites. A detailed study on the optimization of the recycling method with different solvents and washing durations is being undertaken. In addition, the recycling of perovskites with different compositions and their specificity to the recycling method is being studied. A deeper investigation is also needed to know exactly how the surface of the perovskite was modified after recycling.
4. Conclusions
The performance of MAPbI3 solar cells was found to decrease significantly with heating (60, 80, 100 and 120 °C for 1 h) although the perovskite remained unaffected up to 80 °C and degraded insignificantly to PbI2 at 100 and 120 °C. It was interesting to find that the performance degraded only when the perovskite film was heated along with the spiro-OMeTAD layer on top it (with and without an Au film). In other words, the perovskite film free of spiro-OMeTAD, when overheated intentionally to degrade to PbI2, did not show any degradation in the performance and showed the same PCE (16–17%) as the cells without PbI2. This implied that not the PbI2 but the spiro-OMeTAD is directly involved in performance deterioration. The deformation of spiro-OMeTAD (generation of voids in the HTM at high temperature) and certain unidentified modification at the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface seemed to be the main reasons for the performance drop of the cells at high temperature. However, in an attempt to reuse the perovskite from degraded cells, we found that the performance of the cells with fresh spiro-OMeTAD did not recover to the initial value despite the fact that the formed PbI2 was successfully reconverted to perovskite by treatment with MAI. The poorer performance of the recycled cells was essentially due to enhanced recombination, which was likely due to the modified interface between the perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD; SEM and EDX analysis of the perovskite surface after recycling showed neither residual spiro-OMeTAD on the surface nor any change in the atomic ratio of Pb and I, which led us to suspect any change in the MA+ ions. The investigation of MAPbI3 cells with a slight excess of MAI or PbI2 disclosed that MAPbI3 cells with a slight excess of MAI degraded faster but showed better recovery in performance after recycling. This was indicative of the fact that the cation part of the perovskite is involved in the chemical change at the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface. Additionally, MA-free perovskite FA0.85Cs0.15PbI3 cells also showed a greater thermal stability and better recovery than MAPbI3 cells. These results strongly indicated that the drop in cell efficiency in the heated devices was due to the modification of the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface at high temperatures, suggestively caused by the organic cation moiety of the perovskite. Therefore, it is believed that certain compositions of the perovskite (maybe with fewer labile organic cations) can be more stable to such chemical alteration at the interface of the perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD at high temperature. Besides, the replacement of spiro-OMeTAD with a more stable HTM should be a definite strategy to improve the stability of the cells. We also believe that the use of a suitable ion-blocking interlayer between the perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD that can prevent chemical exchange between the perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD can improve the stability and life time of cells using spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM. Therefore, more efforts are required to understand further details about the chemical change taking place at the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface at raised temperature and then find ways to prevent it.
