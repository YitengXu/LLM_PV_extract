    , Accepted 16th February 2022First published on 16th February 2022AbstractSensible selection of host blends and the third component is crucial to give full play to the advantages of the ternary strategy for achieving high efficiency polymer solar cells (PSCs). In this work, a PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl binary system and non-fullerene acceptor DTTC-4ClC9 with the dithienocyclopentacarbazole (DTC) core are selected as the host blend and the third component, respectively. DTTC-4ClC9 and BTP-BO-4Cl are found to have excellent miscibility, and the addition of DTTC-4ClC9 into the binary blend can modify the morphology of the film, which brings out an improved charge transport and obviously enhanced exciton dissociation ability. The non-radiative energy loss of the devices is significantly reduced to 0.207 eV when employing the ternary strategy, thus leading to a reduction in energy loss. As a result, the introduction of 15% DTTC-4ClC9 in the PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl system can promote the power conversion efficiency from 17.11% to remarkable 18.21%, meanwhile, the open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current density, and fill factor are increased simultaneously.
1. Introduction
Increasing worldwide energy consumption has encouraged continuous attempts for more efficient technology to harvest clean and renewable energy. Polymer solar cells (PSCs) as a promising technology for solar energy utilization have achieved tremendous progress in recent years, and the reported power conversion efficiency (PCE) has exceeded 19%.1–3 Such achievements can be attributed to the rapid development of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), novel interfacial materials, and refined morphology optimization of active layers.4–10 The ternary strategy of introducing a third component to extend the absorption of the solar spectrum is an effective and simple approach to realize a better device performance.11–14 The third component could be a donor or an acceptor, and it should have good miscibility with the host binary blend. Versatile NFAs developed in recent years provide plentiful options for the selection of the third component, and many cases have been reported for achieving significantly enhanced performance compared to the host binary systems.15–22
A NFA named BTP-4F (also known as Y6) and a series of its derivatives have been developed since 2019, continuous breakthroughs in the PCE have been made based on these NFAs.3,23–25 To realize better device performance, ternary strategies have been adopted in host binary blends with BTP-series NFAs.26–29 Two types of NFAs have been successfully used as the second acceptor: one is BTP-series NFAs with a larger optical bandgap and similar molecular structure which can provide guarantee for the miscibility of the active layer,17–20,22 and the other is based on another star molecule ITIC and its derivatives, which have a more complementary absorption spectrum and are beneficial to the improvement of the open-circuit voltage (VOC).2,15,16,30,31 A series of NFAs based on dithienocyclopentacarbazole (DTC) have been synthesized since 2017, and an optimized PCE of 15.42% was achieved with a chlorinated nonacyclic derivative named DTTC-4Cl.32–36 What is noteworthy is that the devices with DTC-based NFAs can reach a high VOC value exceeding 0.9 V, which indicates their possible application in ternary PSCs as the third component. In 2020, Li and co-workers introduced a DTC-based NFA, namely C8-DTC, in the blends of PM6 (also known as PBDB-T-2F) and Y6 to realize a PCE of 17.52%.37 More recently, Hsu et al. synthesized DTTC-4ClC9 on the basis of DTTC-4Cl; the introduced alkyl side chains brought improved solubility and the VOC value was slightly improved to 0.95 V for PM6:DTTC-4ClC9 binary solar cells, and they further added DTTC-4ClC9 into PM6:Y6 host blends and a PCE of 16.55% was obtained.38 These results confirmed that DTC-series NFAs could also be an appropriate option as the second acceptor in ternary PSCs.
In this work, we introduced DTTC-4ClC9 into the PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl blend to fabricate high efficiency ternary PSCs and explored its effects on the host binary blends. Among the various Y6 derivatives, BTP-BO-4Cl is a typical chlorinated NFA with superior processability, and its absorption spectrum is significantly redshifted compared to Y6.4 Moreover, the PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl blend film showed an improved crystallinity, and the binary solar cells could reach a PCE of around 17%.6,24,39 It can also be noted that DTTC-4ClC9 exhibited a redshifted absorption spectrum and improved crystallinity compared to its fluorinated counterpart, too. So the introduction of DTTC-4ClC9 in the PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl blend could regulate the mixed-phase and help to make better use of the complementary effects of two acceptors. After the addition of 15 wt% DTTC-4ClC9, the ternary PSCs demonstrate a champion PCE of 18.21% with a simultaneously improved VOC, short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF). The impressive performance of these ternary devices can be mainly attributed to the obviously modified surface morphology, and a reduced non-radiative recombination loss of 0.207 eV. This is the first time that a PCE of over 18% has been realized with a DTC-based NFA, and the value is the highest for the reported ternary PSCs with PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl as the host blend.
2. Results and discussion
The chemical structures of PM6, BTP-BO-4Cl and DTTC-4ClC9 are displayed in Fig. 1, and their UV-vis absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 1b. The absorption spectrum of PM6 displays an absorption wavelength range of 400–700 nm and an absorption peak at 618 nm. Compared with Y6, the electron acceptor material BTP-BO-4Cl has longer side chains on the pyrrole rings and chlorinated end groups, which bring out balanced processability and aggregation features.24 The film exhibits an extended optical absorption in the range of 600–950 nm with an absorption peak at 841 nm. The second NFA DTTC-4ClC9 was developed on the basis of DTTC-4Cl. The nonacyclic DTTC core broadens the absorption range to the near-infrared region and the film shows a strong absorption between 600 and 850 nm with an absorption peak at 758 nm. The introduced alkyl side chains improve its solubility and the chlorinated end groups provide it with enhanced crystalline properties.38 Considering the complementary absorption and good crystallinity of both BTP-BO-4Cl and DTTC-4ClC9, ternary PSCs based on PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl:DTTC-4ClC9 could be a rational choice to enhance the light harvesting. With a small amount of DTTC-4ClC9 incorporated, the ternary active layer displayed an obvious enhanced absorption in the range of 650–800 nm (Fig. S1, ESI†).

To study the influence of DTTC-4ClC9 on photovoltaic properties, ternary PSCs were fabricated with a conventional device structure of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl:DTTC-4ClC9/polyqw[9,9-bis(6′-bromohexyl) fluorene-alt-co-1,4-phenylene] (PFN-Br)/Al, as depicted in Fig. 1d. The PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl based binary and ternary devices were fabricated with a fixed donor/acceptor (D/A) weight ratio of 1:1.2, while the D/A ratio of the PM6:DTTC-4ClC9 based binary device is 1:1.1. Fig. 2a presents the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimal binary and ternary devices under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table 1. The binary device based on PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl exhibited a PCE of 17.11% with a VOC of 0.850 V, a JSC of 26.54 mA cm−2, and an FF of 75.86%. However for the PM6:DTTC-4ClC9 binary blend, after a series of optimization of the device fabrication (Fig. S2, Table S1, ESI†), the disadvantage of low FF can be partially overcome and a PCE of 14.50% with a remarkably high VOC of 0.945 V, a JSC of 21.05 mA cm−2, and an FF of 72.92% can be obtained. Ternary PSCs were fabricated with different amounts of DTTC-4ClC9 added in the PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl host to realize a better performance, and the corresponding J–V curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are shown in Fig. S3† (ESI), and the detailed parameters are summarized in Table S2† (ESI). When the amount of DTTC-4ClC9 reaches 15% in acceptors, the ternary PSC, namely PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl:DTTC-4ClC9 (1:1.02:0.18 in weight), produces an optimized PCE of 18.21% with a simultaneously increased VOC value of 0.864 V, JSC value of 27.12 mA cm−2 and FF value of 77.76%. This is the first time that a PCE of over 18% has been realized with a DTC-based NFA as the third component, and is one of the highest PCE values in ternary PSCs with PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl as the host blends, too. With the addition of DTTC-4ClC9, VOC values were monotonously increased (Fig. S4, ESI†), because the LUMO level of DTTC-4ClC9 is higher than that of BTP-BO-4Cl, while the enhanced JSC values can be ascribed to the complementary absorptions between DTTC-4ClC9 and the PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl host. The EQE spectra of the optimized binary and ternary PSCs are shown in Fig. 2b. The integrated JSC values from the EQE data are 25.77, 26.01, and 20.24 mA cm−2 for PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl, PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl:DTTC-4ClC9, and PM6:DTTC-4ClC9 based devices, respectively. These values are in good agreement with the JSC values obtained from the J–V curves. Fig. 2c exhibits the PCE boxplots of the binary and ternary blends, and the average PCE values are 16.90%, 17.89%, and 14.34% for PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl, PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl:DTTC-4ClC9, and PM6:DTTC-4ClC9 based devices, respectively. The statistical distribution of all the blends indicates that all the PSCs have reproducible PCE values with small deviations.

Fig. 2d shows the dependence of the VOC on illumination densities (P), and the correlation between VOC and P is determined by the formula VOC ∝ nkTq−1ln(P), where n, k, T and q represent the ideality factor, Boltzmann's constant, temperature, and elemental charge, respectively. Here n is in the range of 1 to 2, and reflects the recombination mechanism in the device. As shown in Fig. 2d, the n values for the PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl, PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl:DTTC-4ClC9, and PM6:DTTC-4ClC9 blends are 1.16, 1.14, and 1.11, respectively, which suggest that all devices are dominated by the bimolecular recombination mechanism and trap-assisted recombination is decreased in ternary devices because of the introduction of DTTC-4ClC9.40,41 The correlation between JSC and P can be fitted with power law JSC ∝ Pα, where α is close to 1 and is taken as indicative of weak bimolecular recombination.40 In this case, the α values are 0.976, 0.967, and 0.950 for PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl, PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl:DTTC-4ClC9, and PM6:DTTC-4ClC9 based devices, respectively, where the ternary devices exhibit a combined characteristic of two kinds of binary devices, too. The exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss) of the optimized binary and ternary devices was conducted to investigate the exciton separation process in the devices. Pdiss is calculated according to the curves of photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) shown in Fig. 2f, which is defined as Pdiss = JSC/Jsat, and Jsat is the saturation photocurrent density at a large reverse bias. Jph is defined as Jph = JL – JD, where JL and JD are current densities measured under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2, and in the dark, respectively.42 The effective voltage Veff is defined as Veff = V0 − Vappl, in which V0 is the compensation voltage when JL = JD, and Vappl is the applied voltage from −8 to +3 V.43,44 At a Veff of 3 V, the Jsats for PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl, PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl:DTTC-4ClC9, and PM6:DTTC-4ClC9 blend films is 27.40, 27.32, and 21.73 mA cm−2, respectively, yielding Pdisss of 96.9, 99.3 and 96.9%. The higher Pdiss for ternary devices indicates more efficient exciton dissociation and charge extraction with the addition of DTTC-4ClC9, facilitating the improvement of the FF and JSC.
To understand the origin of the remarkably enhanced photovoltaic performance, the effects on the morphological characteristics, crystallinity and charge-transport properties after the addition of DTTC-4ClC9 were studied. The contact angles of PM6, BTP-BO-4Cl, DTTC-4ClC9, and BTP-BO-4Cl:DTTC-4ClC9 films were measured to evaluate their miscibility, and the images are presented in Fig. 3 and the results are summarized in Table S3† (ESI). The water contact angles (WCAs) for PM6, BTP-BO-4Cl, DTTC-4ClC9, and BTP-BO-4Cl:DTTC-4ClC9 are 104.1°, 101.4°, 107.2°, and 101.8° respectively, while the corresponding diiodomethane contact angles (DCAs) are 50.2°, 39.6°, 36.8°, and 37.8°. The surface tension (γ) values of these films were calculated from the measured contact angles according to the Owen–Wendt method,45,46 and the results were determined to be 36.31, 42.46, 50.02, and 43.73 mN m−1 for PM6, BTP-BO-4Cl, DTTC-4ClC9, and BTP-BO-4Cl:DTTC-4ClC9 pristine films, respectively. The Flory–Huggins interaction parameters (χ) were extracted from γ values according to the formula: 2,47 where K is a constant, and the χ values for PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl, PM6:DTTC-4ClC9, BTP-BO-4Cl:DTTC-4ClC9, and PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl:DTTC-4ClC9 blends are 0.25 K, 1.13 K, 0.31 K, and 0.35 K, respectively. The low χ value for the BTP-BO-4Cl:DTTC-4ClC9 blend indicates its excellent miscibility, while the high χ value for the PM6:DTTC-4ClC9 blend endows the film with strong phase separation and high domain purity.48 The increased χ value for the PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl blend after the introduction of DTTC-4ClC9 implied the improved phase separation, thus has a positive effect in improving the FF and device performance.

The contact angles of PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl, PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl:DTTC-4ClC9, and PM6:DTTC-4ClC9 blend films were measured to qualitatively study the influence of the addition of DTTC-4ClC9 on the component distribution within the photoactive layer.49 As summarized in Fig. S5 and Table S4 (ESI†), the surface tension of PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl and PM6:DTTC-4ClC9 binary blend films is 37.25 and 36.77 mN m−1, respectively, slightly higher than that of the neat PM6 film, but obviously lower than that of neat BTP-BO-4Cl and DTTC-4ClC9 films, and these results indicate that the polymer donor tends to aggregate on the top of the photoactive layer in these binary systems. After the addition of DTTC-4ClC9, the PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl:DTTC-4ClC9 ternary blend film exhibits an increased surface tension of 41.12 mN m−1, which means the acceptors tend to gather on the top of the photoactive layer in ternary devices, which will be beneficial to the transport and collection of electrons in the metal electrode side.50
The morphology of the binary and ternary devices was studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in the height images in Fig. 3c, the root-mean-square surface roughness (Rq) values of PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl, PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl:DTTC-4ClC9, and PM6:DTTC-4ClC9 blend films are 1.33, 1.16 and 0.920 nm, respectively. The reduced Rq value of the ternary blend film indicates that the introduction of DTTC-4ClC9 has a positive effect on the morphological regulation, and these results are also reflected in the TEM images in Fig. 3d, since the ternary blend film exhibits an obviously more uniform morphology than the host binary blend film, and this is conducive to the improvement of the FF. A clear fibrillar structure can be seen in the AFM height images and their corresponding phase images shown in Fig. S6† (ESI). The long fibrillar structure is considered beneficial to the exciton dissociation and charge transport,51 and the nanofibers stack tighter in the ternary film. These phenomena further confirm the good compatibility of two acceptors and explain the improvement of the JSC and FF.
Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were carried out to study the crystallinity and molecular orientation of the blends and figure out the influence of the addition of DTTC-4ClC9. Previous reports have proved that the PM6 film exhibits a mixed face-on/edge-on orientation, while both acceptor films exhibit a preferential face-on orientation.24,38Fig. 4a–c shows the two-dimensional GIWAXS patterns of the binary and ternary blends, and the corresponding 1D line cuts are shown in Fig. 4d, and these results indicate that all the blend films preferentially adopt the face-on orientations. In the blend films of PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl, PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl:DTTC-4ClC9, and PM6:DTTC-4ClC9, the dominant π–π diffraction peaks are located at 1.725, 1.741, and 1.703 Å−1 in the out of plane (OOP) direction, respectively, their intermolecular π–π stacking distances were calculated to be 3.64, 3.61, and 3.69 Å, and crystal coherence lengths (CCL) are 1.61, 1.63, and 1.26, respectively. These results indicate that a small amount of DTTC-4ClC9 could bring about a slight improvement of the π–π stacking in the ternary system. Moreover, in the in plane (IP) direction, both the (100) diffraction peaks of PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl and PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl:DTTC-4ClC9 films are located at 0.297 Å−1, while the CCL of the ternary film is 6.37 nm, higher than that of the PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl film (6.01 nm), and from this view, the addition of DTTC-4ClC9 also has a positive impact on the lamellar stacking. The CCLs associated with the π–π and lamellar stacking peaks in the binary and ternary blend are summarized in Tables S5 and S6† (ESI). Such results indicate that the introduction of DTTC-4ClC9 could induce a higher degree of molecular packing in both OOP and IP directions, which is consistent with the AFM analysis, and will be beneficial to charge transport in the devices.

The influence of DTTC-4ClC9 on the charge-transport properties was studied through space-charge limited current (SCLC) measurements (Fig. S7, ESI†). The electron- and hole-only device structures are ITO/SnO2/active layer/PFN-Br/Al and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Al, respectively. The electron mobility (μe)/hole mobility (μh) for PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl, PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl:DTTC-4ClC9, and PM6:DTTC-4ClC9 blends are determined to be 6.58 × 10−4/4.20 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 8.00 × 10−4/5.48 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and 6.49 × 10−4/2.05 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with the corresponding μe/μh ratios of 1.57, 1.46, and 3.17. A more balanced μe/μh ratio is beneficial for the equilibrium of charge transfer, and contributes to the improved JSC and PCE. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured to understand the enhanced exciton dissociation and transportation. As exhibited in Fig. S8a† (ESI), the absorption spectrum of BTP-BO-4Cl shows a significant spectral overlap with the emission spectrum of DTTC-4ClC9, which indicates the possibility of energy transfer between BTP-BO-4Cl and DTTC-4ClC9. And the PL quenching efficiency of the ternary film (94.1%) is higher than that of PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl (89.9%) and PM6:DTTC-4ClC9 blend ones (86.7%) (Fig. S8b, ESI†), which demonstrates that the addition of DTTC-4ClC9 brings out more efficient exciton dissociation and hole transfer. On the basis of the PL results, a schematic process of charge transfer in the ternary blend films is descripted in Fig. S8c† (ESI). These evidence further explained the increased FF and JSC in the PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl:DTTC-4ClC9 ternary devices.52,53
Energy losses in the devices were studied to investigate the influence of the introduced DTTC-4ClC9. The optical bandgaps (Eg) of the devices were calculated from the derivatives of the EQE spectra (dEQE/dE).54 As shown in Fig. S9† (ESI), the Eg values of PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl, PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl:DTTC-4ClC9, and PM6:DTTC-4ClC9 blends are 1.394, 1.398, and 1.531 eV, respectively. According to the framework of Marcus theory,55 the total energy losses were determined as Eloss = Eg − qVOC, and the Elosss of PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl, PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl:DTTC-4ClC9, and PM6:DTTC-4ClC9 blends are 0.544, 0.534, and 0.586 eV, respectively. The energy losses in PSCs can be divided into two parts: energy lost during charge generation (ΔECT), and energy lost during charge recombination (ECT − eVOC).56 ΔECT correlates closely with the donor and acceptor components and is determined as the difference between Eg and the energy of the interfacial charge-transfer state (ECT) (ΔECT = Eg − ECT). ECT − eVOC can be further divided into radiative (ΔErad) and non-radiative recombination (ΔEnon-rad), in which ΔErad is inevitable for solar cells and ΔEnon-rad is regarded as the main reason for VOC loss in PSCs. Highly sensitive EQE (s-EQE) and electroluminescence (EL) spectra of the solar cells were measured to determine ECT, the relative values are summarized in Table 2 and Fig. S10† (ESI).57 As shown in Fig. 5a–c, ECT values of PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl, PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl:DTTC-4ClC9, and PM6:DTTC-4ClC9 blends are 1.335, 1.362, and 1.489 eV, respectively, and the corresponding ΔECT values are 0.059, 0.036 and 0.067 eV, respectively. ΔEnon-rad can be calculated as ΔEnon-rad = −kTln(EQEEL),58 in which EQEEL is the electroluminescence external quantum efficiency. As indicated in the plots in Fig. 4d, the ternary device has a higher EQEEL value (3.27 × 10−4) than binary devices based on PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl (1.14 × 10−4) and PM6:DTTC-4ClC9 (8.20 × 10−5). The corresponding ΔEnon-rad values are 0.235, 0.207, and 0.243 eV for PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl, PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl:DTTC-4ClC9, and PM6:DTTC-4ClC9 devices, respectively. This result suggests that the nonradiative recombination loss in PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl based devices can be effectively suppressed by introducing DTTC-4ClC9 as the third component, and the low ΔEnon-rad value of 0.207 eV for the ternary device contributes to the improvement of the VOC value.

3. Conclusions
In summary, we introduced DTC-based NFA DTTC-4Cl-C9 as the third component in the PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl binary system to fabricate ternary PSCs. Binary devices based on PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl and PM6:DTTC-4Cl-C9 demonstrated PCEs of 17.11% and 14.50%, respectively. The addition of DTTC-4ClC9 into the PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl blend film brought about a complementary absorption spectrum, and the excellent miscibility between BTP-BO-4Cl and DTTC-4Cl-C9 helped to realize a modified surface morphology, therefore, the exciton dissociation ability and charge transportation were significantly improved, which further contributed to the resultant increased JSC and FF. Moreover, the total energy loss and the non-radiative recombination loss of the ternary PSC were reduced to 0.534 and 0.207 eV, respectively, lower than those of both the binary devices. The best optimized ternary PSCs were obtained with 15 wt% of DTTC-4ClC9 incorporated, and the PCE reached impressive 18.21% with a VOC of 0.864 V, a JSC of 27.12 mA cm−2 and an FF of 77.76%. These results indicate that DTC-based NFA DTTC-4ClC9 could be a promising candidate as the third component in PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl based PSCs to further improve the performance.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Materials
PEDOT:PSS (Clevious P VP AI 4083) was purchased from H.C. Stark Company. Patterned ITO glass with a sheet resistance of 10 Ω per square was purchased from South China Science & Technology Company Limited (Shenzhen, China). PFN-Br, polymer donor PM6, and acceptor BTP-BO-4Cl were purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc. (China). DTTC-4ClC9 was obtained from Prof. Hsu's laboratory. The processing solvents used in the device fabrication were purchased from Acros (USA). All these commercially available materials were used as received without further purification.
4.2 Device fabrication
The device architecture was glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Active layer/PFN-Br/Al. In the device fabrication, all patterned glass/ITO substrates were ultrasonically cleaned twice in succession with detergent water, water, ultra-pure water, ethanol, and isopropanol, respectively. Then, the substrates were blown dry with nitrogen followed by a post UV–ozone (UVO) treatment for 15 min before use. ∼40 nm thick PEDOT:PSS was prepared by spin-coating the filtered PEDOT:PSS solution at 3000 rpm for 30 s onto the substrate, followed by annealing at 150 °C for 15 min in an air atmosphere. The PM6:acceptor blends (1:1.1/1.2 weight ratio) were dissolved in chloroform (the concentration of PM6 is 8 mg mL−1 for all the blends) and stirred overnight. DIO was added into the solutions as the additive before spin coating, and the adding amount for PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl based binary and ternary devices is 0.4% (by volume), while for PM6:DTTC-4ClC9 based binary devices it is 0.5%. The solution was spin-coated onto ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates at optimized 4000 rpm for 30 s, and then the samples were baked at 60 °C for 5 min to obtain the film with a thickness of ∼110 nm. After that, a solution of 0.5 mg mL−1 PFN-Br in methanol was spin-coated at 3500 rpm for 30 s. Finally, 100 nm Al was thermally evaporated in a vacuum at a pressure of 5 × 10−5 Pa on the PFN-Br layer. The active area of each device was about 0.04 cm2, and the area of the mask is about 0.0324 cm2 in our laboratory.
4.3 Instrumentation and device characterization
The J–V curve was recorded using a solar simulator (SS-F5-3A, Enlitech) along with AM 1.5G spectra whose intensity was calibrated by using a certified standard silicon solar cell (SRC-2020, Enlitech) at 100 mW cm−2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a solar-cell spectral-response measurement system (QE-R, Enlitech). A highly sensitive EQE was measured using an integrated system (PECT-600, Enlitech), where the photocurrent was amplified and modulated by using a lock-in instrument. Electroluminescence quantum efficiency (EQEEL) measurements were performed by applying external voltage/current sources through the devices (ELCT-3010, Enlitech), and the measurements were carried out from 0 to 2 V. An atomic force microscope (AFM, Bruker DMFASTSCAN2-SYS) was used to observe the morphologies of PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl, PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl:DTTC-4ClC9, and PM6:DTTC-4ClC9 blend films, and their TEM images were obtained using a JEOL JEM 2100. A surface profilometer Dektak XT (Bruker, Germany) under ambient conditions was employed to investigate the thickness of the active layer. The photoluminescence spectra (PL) were measured by photoluminescence spectroscopy (Hitachi F-7000). GIWAXS measurements were performed on a XEUSS SAXS/WAXS system (XENOCS, France) at the National Center for Nanoscience and Technology (NCNST, Beijing).
