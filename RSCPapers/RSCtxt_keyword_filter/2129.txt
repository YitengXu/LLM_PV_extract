    , Accepted 20th March 2023First published on 11th May 2023AbstractDye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have undergone extensive research and development to improve the device performance for commercial applications and for indoor applications in particular. Currently, titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a key photoanode candidate for DSSC device assemblies. However, the high recombination rate at the interface and low electron mobility of TiO2 remain very challenging disadvantages in devices using stand-alone TiO2 structures as the photoanode. Herein, we report a new scheme consisting of ZnO nanospindles decorated on TiO2 mesospheres as a long-term stable photoanode and explore the photon-induced charge carrier migration/transfer kinetics. Different proportions of ZnO spindles (0.05%, 0.10%, 0.15%, 0.20%, and 0.25%) decorated on the mesosphere TiO2 were effectively synthesised using a simple solvothermal method and the resulting composites were explored as photoanodes in DSSCs. DSSC devices composed of TiO2/ZnO nanocomposites demonstrated improved photovoltaic characteristics at different temperatures as well as exhibiting long-term durability. Regarding photovoltaic performance, the DSSC device with the TZC-0.05 photoanode offered an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.26% and an open circuit voltage VOC of (0.75 V). Furthermore, a long-term stability test of the TZC-0.05 based DSSC device exhibited only a slight drop in the PCE as well as showing stable VOC and FF performance. The best performing DSSC device (TZC-0.05) was studied at various temperatures from 30 to 55 °C, and the best response was exhibited at 35 °C, which is nearly equal to room temperature conditions.
1. Introduction
Solar energy conversion technologies (SCT) are the most promising solution for world energy demands combined with environmental concerns for green energy production to reduce the use of toxic fossil fuels.1,2 Although fossil fuels contribute the major share of the global energy market, their fast depletion provides motivation to move to alternative green energy resources.3,4 In SCT, a solar cell is an efficient transducer device that produces electricity by utilizing solar energy.5 Since Gratzel and O'Regan first demonstrated a DSSC in 1991, DSSCs have opened up a new opportunity to develop low-cost, lightweight, and transparent solar cells (known as third-generation solar cells) over the last two decades.6 These solar cells could also be applied in indoor applications as well as enabling flexible solar cell devices with simple device construction at very low cost.7,8 In recent decades, researchers have attempted to fabricate stable and highly efficient DSSC devices by modification of the photoanode, electrolyte, and counter electrode.9–11 Typically, the semiconductor photoanode is the key component in the DSSC system, which has led to investigating the improvement of photovoltaic performance by broadening the usable light range from the UV (ultraviolet) into the visible region. Among the photoanode candidates, metal oxide semiconductors play a vital role in DSSC device assemblies, including titanium-dioxide (TiO2), zinc oxide (ZnO), tin oxide (SnO2), niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5), and so on.12–15
Compared with other metal oxides, nanostructured TiO2 is a wide bandgap photoanode material owing to its unique properties. These include a high surface area, high conduction band edge, and superior thermal and chemical stability under light irradiation, which are favourable properties for the fabrication of efficient DSSC device assemblies. Nevertheless, TiO2 suffers from certain disadvantages including (i) quick recombination between the conduction band and electrolyte, resulting in slower dye generation and (ii) low electron mobility, resulting in reduced short circuit current density (JSC), thus reducing the overall photoconversion efficiency.16–19 In this respect, researchers have made great efforts to improve the performance of TiO2 with different approaches such as doping,20 formation of bilayers,21 modification of nano-architectures,22 and fabrication of nanocomposites23 to address these shortcomings. In particular, TiO2 composites with low-dimensional metal oxide nanostructures as an electron transport layer have demonstrated good performance as photoanodes in DSSCs.24–26 Typically, ZnO is the most attractive electron transport material owing to its unique properties such as high electron mobility (200 cm2 V1 s1), wide bandgap (∼3.3 eV), good flexibility, and having the second highest PCE in DSSCs. For example, TiO2/ZnO nanocomposites have demonstrated improved charge separation and reduced charge recombination in photoanodes as compared to the individual components due to the coupling effects of TiO2 and ZnO.25–27 Dongting et al. revealed the outstanding performance of a TiO2/ZnO hybrid nanostructure photoanode, which demonstrated a PCE of 4.92% under solar irradiation.28 In another study, TiO2 NP/NF impregnated with various concentrations of ZnO nanoparticles exhibited a maximum JSC of 12.83 mA cm2 and VOC of 0.76 V with a PCE of 6.54%, which is higher than the performance of pristine TiO2 reported by Man et al.13
However, ZnO was found to react with dye molecules via their carboxylic acid groups, which reduced the efficiency. This affects the dye regeneration, which was reflected in a reduction in charge transfer dynamics.29 As a result, the focus is on developing a photoactive layer covered with a compact layer or core shell to reduce recombination and to enhance the scattering of incoming light, respectively, to improve the DSSC performance.30
Herein, we report the development of a novel DSSC device (TZC-0.05) with long-term performance stability, along with the photovoltaic performance of nanocomposite photoanodes. A mesosphere TiO2 composite with different concentrations of ZnO spindles was prepared by a simple solvothermal method. The crystal phase and morphology nature of the prepared samples were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), high resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The remarkable enhancement of the optical properties and carrier lifetime in the prepared samples was confirmed by UV-DRS and TRPL measurements. Therefore, the results suggest that the mesosphere TiO2/ZnO spindle photoanode possesses enhanced light-scattering ability, improved electron transfer, and enhanced charge collection efficiency for high-performance DSSCs.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Materials
Titanium tetra isopropoxide [Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4], ethylene glycol (C2H6O2), acetone (C3H6O), zinc acetate dehydrate ((CH3COO)2Zn·2H2O), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were purchased from Wako chemical, Japan and used without further purification.
2.2 Preparation of mesosphere TiO2
Mesosphere TiO2 was synthesised by a process combining sol–gel and solvothermal methods. In a typical preparation, 3 ml of titanium isopropoxide was mixed with 150 ml of ethylene glycol as a surfactant and the solution was stirred continuously for 12 h at room temperature. After that, 300 mL of acetone and 2 mL of de-ionized water (DI) were added into the above mixed solution. Then, the final product was centrifuged using ethanol and DI water. The resultant product was dried at 60 °C for 10 h, leading to the formation of titanium glycolate. To form mesosphere TiO2, 1 g of the prepared titanium glycolate was mixed with 30 mL of ethanol and 30 mL of DI water. Finally, the solution was changed to an autoclave after a 2 h stirring process and then the reaction was carried out at 180 °C for 12 h. The final product was collected by centrifugation and dried at 60 °C followed by annealing at 350 °C for 2 h.
2.3 Preparation of ZnO nano-spindle decorated TiO2
In a typical hydrothermal procedure, 0.25 g of mesosphere TiO2 was dispersed in 50 mL of DI water. Then, different concentrations of zinc acetate dihydrate (0.05 wt%, 0.10 wt%, 0.15 wt%, 0.20 wt%, and 0.25 wt%) were added followed by stirring for 10 min. The above same-weight percentages of NaOH were added into the composite mixture and stirred at room temperature for 12 h. Then, the solution was transferred to an autoclave and kept in a hot air oven at 150 °C for 15 h. After reaching room temperature, the solution was washed by centrifugation to remove the unreacted ions and then dried at 60 °C. The final products of all the samples were annealed in air atmosphere at 350 °C for 2 h. The synthesized samples were designated as TZC-0 (mesosphere TiO2), TZC-0.05, TZC-0.10, TZC-0.15, TZC-0.20, and TZC-0.25, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 XRD analysis
X-ray diffraction analysis was used to examine the crystal phase of the as-prepared mesosphere TiO2 and TiO2/ZnO nanocomposites as shown in Fig. 1(a). From the XRD patterns, the diffraction peaks of the mesosphere TiO2 sample (TZC-0) appearing at 25.27°, 37.95°, 48.00°, 54.47°, 62.76°, 69.27°, and 75.37° could be indexed to the (101), (004), (200), (211), (204), (220), and (215) crystal planes of the anatase TiO2 phase (JCPDS No: 21-1272). There were no significant changes in the XRD patterns of TZC-0.05 and TZC-0.10 nanocomposites compared to the TiO2 sample. For the TZC-0.15 nanocomposite, the diffraction peaks of anatase TiO2 were observed along with new peaks emerging at 31.74°, 34.39°, 36.46°, 56.75°, 63.00°, and 68.33°, which correspond to the (100), (002), (101), (110), (103), and (112) planes of the ZnO wurtzite structure (JCPDS No: 36-1451) which is confirms the presence of ZnO. There were no secondary phase changes or additional peaks observed which confirmed the purity of the composites.31,32

Raman measurements were used to identify the structural and vibrational mode properties of the prepared samples as displayed in Fig. 1(b). The characteristic vibration modes of anatase TiO2 were observed at 147 cm−1 (Eg), 198 cm−1 (Eg), and 639 cm−1 (Eg), which indicate the (O–Ti–O) symmetric stretching vibration in the TiO2 lattice.33 Besides these, weak peaks appearing at 398 cm−1(B1g) and 518 cm−1 (A1g) were assigned to the symmetric and asymmetric bending vibrations. The anatase TiO2Eg (147 cm−1) peaks in all the TiO2/ZnO composites were slightly shifted from 147 cm−1 to 146 cm−1, as can be observed from the Raman spectra in Fig. 1(b). Moreover, the peak intensity of the Eg (147 cm−1) mode progressively decreased with increasing ZnO content due to phonon confinement resulting from the effects of composite formation and the presence of defects.34
3.2 Morphological analysis

Fig. 2 shows the FESEM images of mesosphere TiO2 and TiO2/ZnO nanocomposites with different concentrations of ZnO. The mesosphere TiO2 shows particles of spherical shape with a rough surface that are uniformly distributed without any aggregation (as shown in Fig. 2(a)). As shown in Fig. 2(b and c), there are no significant changes in the morphology of TiO2 after the addition of ZnO (TZC-0.05, TZC-0.10). It can be observed that ZnO spindles were decorated on TiO2 mesospheres as seen in Fig. 2(d). Further, Fig. 2(e and f) reveal the formation of ZnO spindles on the TiO2 surface.

Moreover, the nature of the mesospheres and construction of ZnO spindles and their corresponding crystal structures were further investigated by TEM, HRTEM, and STEM analysis. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the mesosphere TiO2 is composed of self-assembled tiny TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) with an average sphere size of 650 nm. In addition, the prepared mesosphere TiO2 sample consists of nanoparticles (NPs) of highly crystalline nature, thus providing more surface area and resulting in improved dye loading properties. Fig. 3(b and c) clearly show the formation of ZnO spindles decorated on the TiO2 mesospheres in the nanocomposite sample (TZC-0.25). The HRTEM image of the nanocomposite (as shown in Fig. 3(d–f)) reveals that the mesosphere TiO2 consists of the anatase phase showing an interplanar distance of 0.350 nm assigned to the (101) crystal plane, while the measured interplanar distance for the spindles is 0.262 nm, which is in good agreement with the (002) plane of wurtzite structure ZnO. Fig. 3(g–j) show the STEM image of the TZC-0.25 sample with identification of the elemental distribution in the prepared nanocomposite. The titanium, oxygen, and zinc atoms are evenly distributed, giving direct evidence of the presence of ZnO spindles well distributed over the TiO2 mesosphere surface. Further, details of the possible growth mechanism for mesosphere TiO2 and formation of ZnO spindle decoration on the TiO2 mesospheres are given in Fig. S1.†

3.3 Optical properties
The optical properties of mesosphere TiO2 and TiO2/ZnO nanocomposites were recorded using UV-DRS, PL and TRPL spectroscopy as displayed in (Fig. S2a–S2e).† The absorption edge of the mesosphere TiO2 occurs at 391 nm and is attributed to the band-to-band transition corresponding to the bandgap value of 3.2 eV (anatase TiO2) as shown in Fig. S2(b).†35,36 The inset image of Fig. S2(a)† reveals that with the addition of ZnO into the nanocomposite, the TiO2 absorption edge is red shifted from 391 to 410 nm in the UV region. This significant redshift can be observed in TiO2/ZnO composites due to the interfacial coupling effect between TiO2 and ZnO, as reported in an earlier report.37
The photoluminescence spectra of the prepared samples with an excitation wavelength of 280 nm are depicted in Fig. S2(c).† All the prepared samples exhibited strong PL emission in the UV region and a weak broad emission in the visible region. Strong UV-vis emission at around 396 nm and 409 nm is observed, which can be attributed to the electron interband transition between the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) as near band edge emission (NBE).38,39 Compared with the pure TiO2 mesospheres, the intensity of the nanocomposite emission spectra was quenched owing to the presence of oxygen vacancies on the TiO2 surface. Besides, the emission peaks appearing at 451 nm and 468 nm represent the violet band, which is due to lattice defects such as zinc vacancies (Vzn) caused by the combination of the two metal oxides.40 On the other hand, the blue-green emission band at around 482 nm and the green emission band at 520 nm could be attributed to surface defects such as oxygen vacancies (VO), or Zn interstitial defects (Izn) of ZnO present in the nanocomposite samples.41 Besides, the weak emission peak observed at 492 nm is attributed to an electronic transition induced by defects in the bandgap.42 Fig. S2(d)† shows a pictorial representation of the recombination corresponding to each peak.42 With increased ZnO concentration in the nanocomposites, the PL emission intensity decreased, and the peak slightly shifted towards higher wavelength. These facts reveal that these materials experience less recombination and are suitable for solar cell applications. Fig. S2(e)† shows the time-resolved PL spectra used to derive the kinetic curves of the TZC-0, TZC-0.05, and TZC-0.10 nanocomposite samples. The emission decay fitted using the triple exponential function and explained by the following equation: I(t) = A0 + A1e−t/τ1 + A2e−t/τ2 + A3e−t/τ3(1)where I(t) is the measured PL intensity and t, A0, A1, A2, and A3 are the different fitting parameters. Then, τ1, τ2, and τ3 represent the different lifetimes of different decays which originate from the conduction band edge to the valence band edge of the prepared samples. The parameters τ1 and τ2 represent the fast decay of radiative and non-radiative recombination, whereas the slow decay of τ3 is a direct representation of the recombination properties of interstitial trapped electrons.43 According to Table S1,† the TZC-0.05 sample shows fast decay (τ1 and τ2) and slow decay (τ3), less than that of the pure mesosphere TiO2 sample, which provides direct evidence of an improved rapid decay process. Thus, the observed TRPL results show that the (TZC-0.05) prepared sample possesses improved electron efficiency and reduced recombination.
3.4 Chemical composition analysis
The survey spectra of the prepared samples are given in the ESI as Fig. S3, which clearly shows the existence of Ti, O, and Zn in the TiO2/ZnO composites. The XPS spectra of Ti 2p and Zn 2p are displayed in Fig. S4.† The core-level Ti 2p spectrum reveals Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 at binding energies of 458.5 eV and 464.3 eV, indicating that Ti is present in the Ti4+ state, as depicted in Fig. S4(a).†44 On increasing the concentration of ZnO in the nanocomposites, a shift takes place in the peak positions of Ti 2p3/2 (458.5 eV to 458.2 eV) and Ti 2p1/2 (464.3 eV to 464.0 eV) as well as a decrease in the peak intensities. This might be explained by a rise in the electron density around Ti ions in the TiO2 lattice.45 The core-level spectra of Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2, as depicted in Fig. S4(b),† show corresponding peaks at 1021.9 eV and 1045.0 eV, respectively. The core-level spectra of O 1s could be deconvoluted into two peaks at 529.8 eV and 531.1 eV, as shown in Fig. 4(a–f), which are ascribed to oxygen vacancy defects (VO) and lattice oxygen (LO) bonded to Ti4+ ions on the surface of the samples. However, upon the addition of ZnO, the peak ratio of the oxygen vacancy peak is drastically increased compared to that of mesosphere TiO2 with a respective slight shift in the peak position in the O 1s spectra. Each oxygen vacancy associated with two extra electrons is likely transferred to the vacant 3d orbitals of nearby Ti 5c ions when VO states occur on the surface of TiO2, creating two Ti3+ sites.39,46 Thereby, analysis of the XPS results for the prepared nanocomposites directly reveals the presence of strong surface interaction between TiO2 and ZnO in TiO2/ZnO nanocomposites.

3.5 BET analysis
The surface area and pore structure are important factors in the enhancement of dye loading to increase the number of photogenerated electrons in a DSSC device. The prepared samples were measured by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method and shown in Fig. S5(a).† The obtained physical parameters such as the BET surface area, pore-volume, and pore diameter are listed in Table S2.† The mesosphere TiO2 offers an enhanced surface area of 166.3 m2 g−1, and a slight variation in the surface area is observed after the incorporation of ZnO spindles. The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution curve of TiO2–ZnO is shown in (Fig. S5b and S5c).† It shows a uniform pore size of ∼6.1 nm, which is more evidence of its mesoporous nature and high pore volume.
3.6 DSSC device performance
The electron transport property and light harvesting efficiency of the prepared TiO2/ZnO photoanode were characterized by the J–V curve as shown in Fig. 5. The improvements in the photovoltaic parameters JSC, VOC, FF, and η are listed in Table 1. The photovoltaic performance data shows that JSC improves in the order of TZC-0.05 (12.90 mA cm−2) > TZC-0.10 (10.28 mA cm−2) > TZC-0 (9.66 mA cm−2) > TZ-0.20 (8.58 mA cm−2) > TZC-0.15 (7.82 mA cm−2) > TZC-0.25 (4.71 mA cm−2). It is well known that mesosphere TiO2 consists of interconnected NPs, and the electron in the individual NPs is highly mobile. The numerous NP boundaries and dead-ends in the NP border restrict the microscopic electron transport which limits the device performance.47 Meanwhile, the N719 dye sensitized TiO2/ZnO photoanode showed enhanced key parameters. The DSSC device based on the TZC-0.05 photoanode improved (JSC: 12.90 mA cm−2, VOC: 0.75 eV, FF: 55%) with an efficiency of 5.26%. The performance of TZC-0.10 (5.01%) was improved compared to that of the TZC-0 device (4.01%). It is worth noting that significant improvement is achieved for the electron transport as well as the scattering of incoming light.48 The remarkable improvement in JSC is due to the significant contribution of the ZnO composites which prevented the recombination and enhanced the dye loading capacity reported by Mustafa et al.4 In the presence of ZnO, the VOC value is significantly increased from 0.73 V to 0.80 V. This increment is caused by the excellent electron transport of ZnO nano-spindles and a minor positive shift in the conduction band edge of ZnO which results in enhanced electron density in TiO2.49 Ohsaki et al. reported that the electron life-time is three times larger in nanorods as compared to that in nanoparticles.50 As mentioned above, ZnO nano-spindles could established direct electron transport in the TiO2/ZnO photoanode. The decorated ZnO nano-spindles favour the light scattering effect enhancing the light harvesting efficiency, thereby enhancing the JSC for all the TiO2/ZnO devices. Thus, we have achieved high open circuit voltage in the ZnO-based device, and the observed high VOC is also comparable with other reported devices and represented in Fig. S6.†51–57 The fast electron transport in the TiO2/ZnO photoanode is the reason for the high JSC and VOC as compared with the TiO2 photoanode.

TZC-0.15, TZC-0.20 and TZC-0.25 devices show high VOC but decreased JSC and η.58–60 The possible reason for the decrement in the J–V curve is that the acidic environment of N719 dye leads to the formation of Zn2+ dye complexes, which inhibits the electron injection efficiency, and the decreased surface area limits the dye loading capacity. The cross-sectional image indicates that the overall thickness of the fabricated photoanode (TZC-0 and TZC-0.05) estimated by FE-SEM is approximately 14 μm, as shown in Fig. 5(b and c). Fig. 5(d) represents the schematics of TiO2 and TiO2/ZnO based DSSC devices. Thus, it can be argued that the appropriate amount of ZnO nano-spindles is essential to facilitate the electron transport and light which improve the DSSC device performance.
3.7 IPCE, dye loading and DRS spectra
The IPCE spectra of mesosphere TiO2 and TiO2/ZnO photoanode-based DSSC devices are shown in Fig. 6(a). The relative peaks of TZC-0.05 (70%) and TZC-0.10 (69%) devices exhibit a high IPCE percentage and shift to higher wavelength as compared to the TZC-0 (59%) device. The IPCE is defined by the following equation:61 IPCE(λ) = Aφinjηcoll(2)where A stands for the TiO2 dye absorption, which is the percentage of incoming light that the dye molecules absorb. φinj is the injection efficiency which is the average of the excitation of an adsorbed dye molecule and resultant electron injection into the TiO2 conduction band. The collection efficiency ηcoll is the charge collection efficiency at the FTO/TiO2 interface. Overall, the percentage of IPCE for ZnO composite-based devices shows high and low dye absorption. The low dye absorption is due to the reduction of the surface area and Zn2+ complex formation directly affects the collection efficiency and injection efficiency, which is also consistent with the BET analysis.62 Further, the TiO2/ZnO based DSSC devices provide a similar trend of dye loading, which is potent enough to affect the parameters A and φinj, influencing the greater photon absorption and transfer to TiO2.63 The main factor in IPCE is ηcoll, which determines how efficiently the collected carriers from TiO2 travel to the FTO substrate without recombination at the interface. Overall, the use of the ZnO composites potentially creates specific pathways for electron transport and efficiently blocks the back-transfer of electrons to dye molecules.

Fig. 6(b) and Table 1 show the dye loading values and corresponding performance parameters. The photoanodes TZC-0.05 and TZC-0.10 exhibit greater dye loading than the pristine TiO2 photoanode. The TiO2/ZnO nanocomposites improve the dye absorption and scatter the incoming light in the DSSC device assembly, and the amount of dye absorbed on the photoanode can be calculated by the following equation:64 (3)
The UV-DRS spectra of dye-loaded photoanodes composed of mesosphere TiO2 and TiO2/ZnO nanocomposites are shown in Fig. 6(c). All the samples exhibit lower reflectance than mesosphere TiO2, which directly shows that their incident light undergoes significant scattering within the photoanode in the visible to near-infrared region.65
4. Stability test and impact of operating temperature
Further, the characteristics of stability and durability for fabricated devices are essential for their commercialization. Stability testing of the prepared devices was conducted at intervals of 24 h for 10 days as depicted in Fig. 7. The stability of the DSSC devices is controlled by the following two factors. (i) The physical stability is associated with degradation or leakage of the liquid-based electrolyte at a given temperature. (ii) The intrinsic chemical stability of the dye or electrolyte components is related to irreversible electrochemical and thermal degradation that may occur during cell operation.33Fig. 7 displays the TZC-0 device, in which the overall photovoltaic performance shows a gradual decrease, with parameters such as JSC (9.51–7.84 mA cm−2), VOC (0.73–0.70 V), FF (71–55), and η (5.01–3.85%). In contrast, the TZC-0.05 based device offers stable photovoltaic performance with an 11% drop in efficiency (5.26 to 4.70) compared to 30% for the TZC-0 device. In addition, the TZC-0.05 device showed relatively low degradation. Thus, the incorporation of ZnO spindles into TiO2 photoanodes caused a boost in the electron mobility and also acted as an energy barrier at the interface, which enhanced the photovoltaic performance.

To further understand the stability behaviour of DSSC (TZC-0.05), performance tests were carried out at various operating temperatures from room temperatures to 55 °C as shown in Fig. 8(a and b). The current density (JSC) of the device shows a considerable increase on heating up to 55 °C (12.86–13.54 mA cm−2) and then starts decreasing, whereas VOC is not changed significantly. On the other hand, the maximum PCE of 4.98% is achieved at 35 °C with minimum losses of FF. Hinsch et al. stated that in general, the reasons for the decrease in JSC are (i) dye degradation or changes in the absorption spectra due to replacement of the ligands, reducing the electron injection efficiency,66 or (ii) decomposition of the electrolyte, which may lead to deposits on the TiO2 surface and cause dye desorption.67

4.1 EIS spectra
Further study of the behaviour of electron transport and charge recombination at the interface of the DSSC device was performed using EIS spectra. Fig. 9 and Table S3† illustrate typical Nyquist plots with the corresponding equivalent circuit and electrochemical impedance parameters, respectively. The smaller semicircle shows the charge transfer resistance (Rct1) between the counter electrode and electrolyte in the higher frequency range. Also, the charge transfer resistance (Rct2) at the TiO2/electrolyte interface is reflected by the middle frequency region's broader semicircle. Typically, a higher arc radius indicates high charge transfer resistance, whereas the TZC-0.05 based DSSC device exhibited a lower arc radius compared to all the other fabricated devices. This indicates the presence of low electron transport resistance due to the presence of a direct electron path and inhibition of electron recombination, resulting in higher JSC and a photo-conversion efficiency of 5.26%.68,69

Conclusion
The effect of the decoration of ZnO spindles on mesosphere TiO2 utilized as a photoanode on the performance of DSSCs was thoroughly investigated. Further, the effects of ZnO and operating temperature on the DSSC device performance were studied, and stability issues were addressed. As the ZnO concentration was increased, the absorption shifted towards higher wavelength and reduced the electron–hole recombination compared to mesosphere TiO2, as studied using UV and TRPL spectra. Then, the J–V profile results showed significant enhancement of the VOC compared to the TZC-0 based DSSC device, up to 0.80 V. In contrast, the maximum PCE of 5.26% was achieved for the TZC-0.05 based device compared to 4.01% for the mesosphere TiO2 (TZC-0) device. The maximum PCE of 5.26% was achieved for the TZC-0.05 device, which revealed higher JSC and VOC than the TZC-0 device. The long-term stability and temperature-dependent behaviour were studied for the best-performing DSSC device. The best-performing TZC-0.05 device showed excellent stability over 10 days. There was no change in the parameters VOC and FF when compared to the TZC-0 device and only an 11% drop in the PCE was observed after 10 days. The TZC-0.05 device showed stability and performed well at 35 °C with minimum loss of efficiency. Thus, the incorporation of ZnO into mesosphere TiO2 provides an alternative method to achieve higher voltage DSSC devices.
