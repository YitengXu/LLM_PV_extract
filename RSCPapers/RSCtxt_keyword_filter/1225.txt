    , Accepted 4th January 2017First published on 2nd February 2017AbstractThe electron transport layer (ETL) plays a critical role in high efficiency perovskite solar cells. In this study, an anodic TiO2 nanotube film was transformed into a TiO2 nanotube network film, which maintained its advantage as an efficient ETL for perovskite solar cells. Compared with the mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticle ETL, the TiO2 nanotube network ETL can increase the efficiency of perovskite solar cells by 26.6%, which is attributed to its superior charge collection property and light trapping ability. The results confirm the importance of optimizing the electron collecting layer and suggest another way to design and fabricate novel perovskite solid state solar cells, potentially by using a TiO2 nanotube network film as an alternative high efficiency electrode.
Introduction
Organometallic halide perovskite-based solar cells (PSCs) are attracting increasing attention as the most promising new generation of photovoltaic technology.1–6 The power conversion efficiency of PSCs was improved from an initial 3.8% to 20.1% over the past few years.7–10 The primary advantage of perovskite is its direct bandgap with large absorption coefficients over a broader range, enabling highly efficient light harvesting in very thin films.11,12 Moreover, it has shown exceptional electric properties owing to its high charge carrier mobility,13 small exciton binding energy (≈50 meV),14 and long exciton diffusion length.15–17 The structures of perovskite solar cells can be classified into two types: a mesoporous structure based perovskite solar cell and a planar heterojunction based perovskite solar cell.1,18 In general, both types of perovskite solar cells are composed of a counter electrode, a hole transporting material (HTM), perovskite, and an electron transport layer (ETL) on conductive glass. Once activated, the photo excited electrons are transferred to the conduction band of the ETL and the holes are transferred to the HTM. The quality of the perovskite and electrode materials is essential for high performance perovskite solar cell fabrication.
Efforts have been applied toward improving the PCE of devices by engineering the perovskite morphology19–27 and developing advanced HTMs.28–34 However, the importance of the ETL has not been extensively explored. The ETL plays an important role in extracting electrons from the perovskite layer and blocking recombination between electrons in the FTO and holes in the perovskite layer.35 In addition, the perovskite layer morphology and loading also depend on the structure of the ETL, which affects the PCE significantly.36 Finally, the light trapping capability might also be increased using a certain ETL structure.37 Although several ETL materials have been reported, such as graphene/TiO2 nanocomposites,38 yttrium-doped TiO2,39 ZnO,40,41 and SnO2,42 which provide efficient electron transport with promising conversion efficiency, the use of a one-dimensional oxide material, such as TiO2 tubes and ZnO nanowires might be an attractive strategy to enhance the charge collection efficiency, increase perovskite loading and improve the light trapping ability.
Anodic TiO2 nanotube (NT) arrays have been widely investigated due to their easy fabrication process and superior properties as one-dimensional materials for advanced applications. When used as an ETL material, TiO2 nanotube arrays showed superior performance to nanoparticle scaffolds in terms of light harvesting enhancement and increased charge collection.43,44 We reported the fabrication of TiO2 nanotube based perovskite solar cells with a liquid electrolyte and demonstrated the advantages over TiO2 nanoparticle electrodes.37 However, the relatively long nanotube structure is not feasible for high performance solid state perovskite solar cell fabrication because of the variations in the pore-filling fraction for both the perovskite and the HTM.45,46 Regarding this challenge, Raul et al. simplified the structure and developed solid state TiO2 NT perovskite solar cells without a HTM, but only obtained a relatively low efficiency of 5%.46 Their results also show that a shorter nanotube structure (400 nm) has a higher efficiency and they clarified that the filling problem is a factor that hinders the application of long nanotubes. Recently, Choi et al. built an ultrathin (<100 nm) TiO2 NT film on FTO by sputtering and anodization, which increased the efficiency of the perovskite solar cell by 22% compared with traditional ETLs.47 The result confirms the superiority of the nanotube structure, but the fabrication process is complex and the anodization of ultrathin TiO2 films is hard to control.
In this paper, we report a TiO2 nanotube network based ETL originating from anodic TiO2 NT arrays, which increased the efficiency of perovskite solar cells by 26.6% (from 10.9% to 13.8%). In this work, the nanotube arrays were decomposed into separated nanotubes and formed a network with no discernible pattern after deposition. The reformed nanotube network structure maintains the ability of light trapping and induces enhanced light absorption. Meanwhile, the obtained ETL shows good charge collection efficiency and subsequently results in an increased power conversion efficiency. The results also indicate that the advantage of anodic TiO2 nanotubes as an ETL is independent to an array structure, which provides another way to design and fabricate novel perovskite solid state solar cells.
Experimental
TiO2 nanotube network ETL fabrication
The titanium dioxide nanotube network ETL was obtained by spin coating a TiO2 nanotube based solution. First, a free standing TiO2 nanotube membrane was fabricated by anodization of Ti foils in a NH4F based solution followed by a self-detached process.37,48 After ultrasonic cleaning with acetone, ethanol and water, the Ti foil was anodized under 70 V for 1 hour in the ethylene glycol (EG) electrolyte, which contains 0.3 wt% NH4F and 0.6 vol% H2O. The obtained film was annealed at 450 °C for 2 hours and then transferred back for anodization at 12 V for 30 minutes and 100 V for 30 minutes for self-detached treatment. After the final anodization, the sample was washed in de-ionized water, and during the drying process, a thin anatase TiO2 nanotube array membrane layer was self-detached from the substrate.
For spin coating solution preparation, the nanotube array film was ground into a powder, which may break the nanotube bundle, but does not destroy the tube structure. Then, a 10 wt% solution of ethyl cellulose was prepared by mixing two Fluka solutions, which are 0.448 g Fluka #46070 dissolved in 5.11 ml ethanol and 0.352 g Fluka #46080 dissolved in 4.01 ml ethanol. The spin coating solution was prepared by mixing 0.4 g of TiO2 nanotube powder, 2 g of Fluka solution, 1.4 g of terpineol, and 16.2 g of ethanol and then ultransonicated for 2 h to further break the TiO2 nanotube bundles, yielding a 2 wt% TiO2 nanotube solution.
Device fabrication
FTO-coated glass was cleaned with acetone, ethanol and water, and subjected to an O3/ultraviolet treatment for 30 minutes. The FTO layer was first covered with 0.1 M Ti(IV) bis(ethyl acetoacetato)-diisopropoxide in 1-butanol solution by spin coating and then heated at 500 °C for 30 minutes. The TiO2 nanotube ETL was deposited by spin coating the nanotube solution at 2000 rpm for 30 seconds and annealed for 60 minutes at 500 °C. A two-step method was used for perovskite deposition. PbI2 was deposited by spin coating 1 M PbI2 solution in N,N-dimethylformamide at 2000 rpm for 5 s and 6000 rpm for 5 s, then dried at 60 °C for 5 minutes. After cooling to room temperature, CH3NH3I in 2-propanol (7 mg ml−1) was spin coated on the TiO2 ETL and CH3NH3I was synthesized according to procedures described in the literature.7 The obtained electrode was then heated at 100 °C for 5 minutes. Afterwards, 25 μl of a chlorobenzene solution containing 68 mM Spiro-OMeTAD, 55 mM tert-butylpyridine and 9 mM lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide salt was cast onto the perovskite coated substrate and spun at a rate of 4000 rpm for 30 seconds. The cells were left in the dark in air overnight prior to thermal evaporation of 80 nm Ag to complete the solar cells.
Device characterization
Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to characterize the morphology of the nanotube ETL and perovskite film. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a Bruker D8 DISCOVER diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The light absorbance of the photoelectrode was characterized using an Ocean Optics UV-VIS Spectrometer (SD2000 fiber optics). The J–V properties of the obtained solar cells were tested using a Keithley 2420 source meter under illumination of 100 mW cm−2 by an oriel solar simulator. The area of the solar cell was 0.32 cm2. Incident photon to charge carrier efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed using a Newport measurement kit with a 300 W Xe lamp source. The wavelength of light was tuned with a Newport CS260 monochromator. Photovoltage decay measurements and EIS spectra were performed by a CHI660D Electrochemical Analyzer.
Results and discussion
For mesoporous structure perovskite solar cells, the morphology of the TiO2 scaffold affects light scattering and perovskite loading and ultimately determines the electrical characteristics of the cell, such as the charge injection and diffusion. A TiO2 nanotube network film was fabricated from the free-standing anodic TiO2 nanotube arrays (Fig. 1a and b). The diameter of the nanotubes is around 95 nm. As a promising ETL, anodic TiO2 nanotube arrays have proven to be an efficient charge collection electrode for solar cells which is attributed to their light trapping ability and fast charge transport feature. However, the roughness of the array surface will cause variation in the pore-filling fraction of the active material, especially the HTM, which makes it hard to get a high efficiency solar cell. Therefore, to make the nanotube structure suitable for electrode fabrication, the bundled nanotube array was split into separated nanotubes by ultrasonic vibration, which formed a nanotube network film after spin coating the broken nanotube based slurry. Further experimental details are provided in the experimental section. Fig. 1c–e show SEM images of the TiO2 nanotube network ETL before and after the perovskite dye deposition respectively. Fig. 1e shows the surface morphology of the prepared ETL with the TiO2 nanotube network. It shows that some nanotube structures are embedded in the film, forming a network structure. The tube shape remains intact in the process of breaking the nanotube bundles, which may act as a light scattering center and subsequently improve the light diffusion and enhance the light absorption. Due to its porous structure, the gap between the tubes and the tube’s inner surface might provide more deposition sites for perovskite loading, which may increase the photo activity of the device. Fig. 1d and e show the perovskite deposition on the surface of the nanotube network ETL. A uniform high quality perovskite film with high coverage was obtained. The size of the perovskite particles was around 300 nm. It is interesting that the relatively rough top surface didn’t affect the formation of the perovskite. The deposited perovskite crystals on the nanotube network electrode are similar to those deposited on a particle mesoporous electrode (Fig. S1, ESI†), but have a higher surface coverage. The formation of perovskite was also characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy (Fig. 1f). After the transformation process from PbI2 to CH3NH3PbI3 was accomplished, a series of new diffraction peaks related to a tetragonal perovskite structure were observed. The strong peaks located at 14.20, 19.78, 28.23, 28.52, 29.80, 31.95, 40.61 and 43.20 degrees correspond to the reflections from the (110), (112), (004), (220), (310), (312), (224) and (314) lattice planes of the tetragonal perovskite structure.7,49 It demonstrates that the formation of CH3NH3PbI3 is well controlled and the final perovskite absorber deposition is well crystallized.

To evaluate the performance of the TiO2 nanotube network ETL, perovskite solar cells were fabricated using a TiO2 nanotube network film as an ETL to collect electrons and spiro-OMeTAD as a HTM to collect holes. Fig. 2a shows the structure of an obtained TiO2 nanotube network based solar cell. As shown in the cross section scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the device (Fig. 2b), the thickness of the TiO2 nanotube network film is optimized to around 250 nm. Meanwhile, it is observable that some nanotube structures exist at the bottom of the electrode layer, which also acts as a charge transport accelerator and light diffusion center. Fig. 2c shows the current–voltage curves of a perovskite solar cell based on the TiO2 nanotube network ETL under AM1.5 illumination. For comparison, a traditional nanoparticle based device with the same device geometry was also characterized. A photo conversion efficiency of 13.8% is obtained with the nanotube film ETL, resulting from a photocurrent density (JSC) of 24.8 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.88 V and a fill factor of 0.63. When the nanoparticle ETL with the same thickness was used, the device demonstrated a cell efficiency decrease to 10.9%, a photocurrent density (JSC) of 21.7 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.80 V and a fill factor of 0.60. Using the TiO2 nanotube scaffold ETL host results in significant photocurrent increase as well as photovoltage and fill factor improvement and thus a significantly higher photo conversion efficiency. The stabilized power output close to the maximum power point is presented in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The photocurrent density stabilized within seconds to approximately 19.7 and 16.0 mA cm−2, yielding stabilized PCEs of 13.1% and 10.1%, respectively. This indicates that our test conditions provide an accurate representation of the photovoltaic performance of the devices, which is consistent with the J–V measurements. In order to confirm the reproducibility, a statistical study was performed with 20 cells for each group (Fig. 2e). The average value of each group is shown in Table 1. Overall, the TiO2 nanotube network ETL performance was superior to that of the corresponding TiO2 mesoporous film. In addition, the nanotube network ETL also exhibits less hysteresis, as seen with the smaller difference between the back and forward sweeps compared to that of the mesoporous TiO2 film (Fig. 2c and Table S1, ESI†), which illustrates a superior electron extraction ability of reducing charge accumulation in the perovskite layer. Fig. 2d shows the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the fabricated perovskite solar cells based on the nanotube scaffold film and the mesoporous nanoparticle film, respectively. Integrating the product of the AM1.5G photon flux with the IPCE spectrum of the nanoparticle and nanotube based devices yielded a predicted JSC of 20.7 mA cm−2 and 23.4 mA cm−2 respectively, which is in agreement with the measured value of the photocurrent density. The shape of the curve has a high similarity with the absorption spectrum of typical perovskite solar cells. It is interesting that the nanotube network based ETL has a higher quantum efficiency at both long wavelength (above 600 nm) and short wavelength regions (below 400 nm), which suggests that the enhanced photocurrent may not only be attributed to improved light absorption, but also to an increased charge collection efficiency.

The light absorption enhancement of the TiO2 nanotube network based electrode was investigated by ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 3. Generally, both CH3NH3PbI3 sensitized electrodes show strong ability to absorb visible light, suggesting a high quality of the perovskite crystals. The two electrodes show comparable light absorbance in the short wavelength region from 375 nm to 550 nm. However, the nanotube array based electrodes have significantly larger absorbance over the long wavelength region than the nanoparticle based electrodes. With TiO2 nanotubes as the perovskite host, the absorbance was enhanced, especially in the long wavelength region, which could contribute to the enhanced light trapping ability of the nanotube networks. The enhanced light absorption will help generate more photo excited electrons and improve the power conversion efficiency. The inset of Fig. 3 presents the corresponding absorption characteristics of both the nanoparticle and nanotube based electrodes, clearly showing the enhanced light absorption in the region of 550 nm to 800 nm. This result reveals that the enhanced quantum efficiency across the long wavelength region, as shown in the IPCE spectra, could contribute to the enhanced light absorption. On the other hand, in the short wavelength region, both ETLs have similar high absorptions, suggesting that the enhanced quantum efficiency in the UV range may contribute to the superior charge transport property of the nanotube structure, which consequently results in a better charge collection efficiency. The light scattering feature here is in good agreement with that shown in the nanotube array based electrode reported in the literature.37 It is noticed that although a broken nanotube network is used in this work, the light absorption could still be enhanced with a randomly aligned network electrode. It is interesting that the superior light trapping ability is dependent on the array structure, suggesting that nanotubes could be light scattering centers which increase the light travelling path and therefore the light absorption inside the solar cell. The results indicate that TiO2 nanotubes could be a promising host for CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells with significant light absorption enhancement effects, which is important for the design of high efficiency solar devices and may provide a new route to improve current perovskite solar cell technology.

To further understand the effect of the TiO2 nanotube network ETL on the improved photovoltaic performance, the charge transport and recombination properties of the TiO2 nanotube network film based photoelectrode are evaluated using photovoltage decay measurements (Fig. 4a and b). The electron lifetimes (τn) could be derived from the photovoltage decay curve according to,50  where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and q is the positive elementary charge.

(d) Summary of the recombination resistance at different bias. Inset is the equivalent circuit model employed for impedance analysis. 
Photovoltage decay plots and electron lifetimes as a function of photovoltage are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. It is shown that the photovoltage of the nanotube based electrode decays more slowly than that of the mesoporous electrode, which also presents a longer electron lifetime at equal potentials (Fig. 4b). The increased electron lifetime of the nanotube network ETL suggests a low charge recombination rate and high charge collection efficiency.43
This result may explain the high quantum efficiency of the nanotube network ETL in the short wavelength region. Since the photoelectrode based on the TiO2 nanotube electrode ETL and the nanoparticle mesoporous ETL have almost the same level of excellent light absorption ability below 500 nm, the photoexcited charge extraction and collections are the key factors that affect the solar cell performance. Therefore, the increased quantum efficiency could be attributed to the enhanced charge collection feature. In the nanotube network ETL, the nanotube structure provides additional routes to charge separation in rational directions and part of the electron charges could be collected along the one dimensional nanotube with a high efficiency, which reduces the average charge recombination rate and improves the charge collection efficiency.
To further investigate the charge transport process in the devices, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to evaluate the obtained perovskite solar cells. Fig. 4c shows the typical Nyquist plots of the solar cells based on a TiO2 network and mesoporous ETL respectively. It is noted that no distinct transmission line behavior is observed in the low frequency range in our experiments. Different with conventional sensitized solar cells, this new behavior can be attributed to the thin TiO2 layer in perovskite solar cells. Its relatively low electron transport resistance under illumination does not allow for the adequate resolution of any transmission line feature.51,52 Therefore, a simplified equivalent circuit model could be used to analyze the data, where the high frequency semicircle and low frequency semicircle were attributed to the charge transfer resistance and recombination at the perovskite/HTM and TiO2/perovskite interface respectively.52,53 The difference is negligible in the semicircle at a high frequency for the nanotube and nanoparticle based devices, suggesting consistent hole transfer resistances at the perovskite/HTM interface. It is shown that only the resistance associated with the lower frequency feature changes significantly due to different interfacial materials in the compared devices. The results suggest that such low frequency featured resistance should be assigned to the TiO2 ETL related recombination resistance of the solar cells. It can be seen that a nanotube ETL based device has a larger radius of the semicircle in the low frequency region when compared with that of the nanoparticle mesoporous film based device (Fig. 4c), which indicates a high recombination resistance at the TiO2–perovskite interface, suggesting a low recombination rate. This result is consistent with the photovoltage decay analysis described above. Moreover, as shown in the EIS measurements, when a forward applied bias is applied, the first semicircle in the high frequency region remains almost unchanged, while the semicircle at low frequency increases significantly. As shown in Fig. 4d, the recombination resistance decreases exponentially for both the nanotube network and mesoporous ETL devices with increasing potential. The recombination resistance of the nanotube network device is always higher than that of the mesoporous device at the same bias voltage. The TiO2 nanotube network device possesses a relatively high recombination resistance, suggesting a lower recombination rate, thus resulting in a higher open circuit voltage. The results confirm the superior charge transport property of the TiO2 nanotube network ETL in perovskite solar cell devices.
Conclusions
As the ETL of perovskite solar cells, anodic TiO2 nanotube arrays have advantageous properties including high light absorption and charge collection over conventional TiO2 nanoparticles. However, the TiO2 nanotube array structure may induce variations in the deposition of perovskite and the HTM, which lowers the performance of perovskite solar cells. The morphological problems of the nanotube arrays were investigated and successfully addressed in this study using an alternative ETL fabrication method based on ultra-sonication and spin-coating. The resultant TiO2 network ETL displayed a well-defined nanostructure morphology with separated nanotubes embedded as light diffusion centers and an alternative charge transport channel with a high efficiency. The unique morphological characteristics of the TiO2 network layer enhanced the light scattering to increase the light absorption and improved the effective electron extraction and collection. In our fabricated perovskite solar cells, the TiO2 network ETL increased the PCE by 26.6%, from 10.9% to 13.8%. These results reveal that the performance of the ETL is predominantly affected by its morphological properties and that one-dimensional materials are advantageous as ETLs. This study provides important insights into the design of high efficiency ETLs for fabricating high efficiency perovskite solar cells.
