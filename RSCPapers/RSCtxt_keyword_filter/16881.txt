    , Accepted 17th January 2021First published on 18th January 2021AbstractMetal halide perovskites have drawn considerable attention thanks to their excellent optoelectronic performances. However, further development has been severely hampered by their poor stability. Recently, it has been confirmed experimentally that the optical performance of perovskites is significantly improved by the incorporation of a CdS layer. Based on this, first-principles calculations are conducted to probe the inherent mechanism, including the electronic structure, absorption spectra, strain effect, etc. The optimized geometric structure shows that the distance between the CdS layer and the FAPbI3 layer is smaller than 3.0 Å, which implies that the CdS/FAPbI3 heterostructure is more stable than common van der Waals heterostructures. Moreover, it is revealed that the electronic states at the band gap edge are from different component layers. It is further unveiled by Bader charge analysis that the electronic charge is transferred from the FAPbI3 layer to the CdS layer, which is consistent with the charge density difference (CDD). In addition, the absorption coefficient in the CdS/FAPbI3 heterostructure is remarkably enhanced, compared with that of pure perovskite FAPbI3. Furthermore, the strain effect on the bandgap of the CdS/FAPbI3 is also explored. These results shed new light on understanding and designing new kinds of highly efficient perovskite-based photovoltaic materials.
1 Introduction
Perovskites, as a category of emerging optical absorbers, have stood out from the numerous photovoltaic materials, thanks to facile technologies, highly cost-effective production and rapidly improved power conversion efficiency (PCE). In 1978,1 a perovskite was experimentally synthesized and characterized for the first time, but it was not until 20092 that perovskites really attracted considerable attention from all over the world. At that time, Miyasaka and co-workers originally used an organic metal halide perovskite as a light sensitized layer instead of dye molecular particles in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), and the PCE of the resulting device was only 3.8%.2 Since then, the PCE of perovskite-based solar cells has been continually updated, and it is worth noting that recently the PCE has exceeded 25%.3 Moreover, it has been unveiled that perovskites have some unique characteristics including a long carrier diffusion length,4 a small exciton binding energy and effective mass,5 a wide optical response and a high optical absorption coefficient,6 and so on. Furthermore, it has been experimentally demonstrated that perovskites can be also exploited as either a hole transport layer or electronic transport layer in addition to an optical absorption layer.7,8 Based on the aforementioned properties, perovskites stand out from the numerous photovoltaic candidates. In addition, it has also been reported that perovskites have extensive applications including for light emitting diodes (LEDs),9 photodetectors,10 lasers,11 lenses,12 memory devices13,14 and so forth. Therefore, it is of interest to explore the intrinsic characteristics of perovskites because of their potential optoelectronic applications.
Perovskites have the formula ABX3, where A is FA (NH2CHNH2+), MA (CH3NH3+), or Cs+;B is Pb2 +, Sn2+, or Ge2+; X is a halide ion of I−, Br− or Cl−. There are two features of perovskites: one is that the B-site atoms are surrounded by six X-site atoms, forming corner-sharing [BX6]4− octahedrons; the other is that the A-site atoms are in the geometric center of eight [BX6]4− octahedrons, which means that an A-site atom is surrounded by twelve X-site atoms. To ensure the formation of perovskite structures, it is necessary here to introduce the tolerance factor15 and octahedral factor,16 with the definitions, (1a) (1b)where the parameter Ri (i = A, B, X) represents the ionic radius of the corresponding element. To preserve the stability of the perovskite structures, the limitations of 0.442 < μ < 0.895 (which implies the limitation condition of RB < RX) should be satisfied. As is well known, there are several classic phases in perovskites, including cubic, trigonal, hexagonal, tetragonal and orthorhombic phases.17 Moreover, the tolerance factor gradually tends to 1 with the increase in symmetry. By contrast, the octahedral factor μ is mainly used to characterize the stability of [BX6]4− octahedrons.
As for FAPbI3 in the present work, there are trigonal (space group, P3m1, perovskite) and hexagonal (space group, P63mc, non-perovskite) phases, determined by the synthesis conditions.18,19 The generation of FAPbI3 in the hexagonal phase is usually suppressed, because it is not favorable for transferring electrons and harvesting visible light. In addition, it has been extensively reported that the electronic orbits at the band gap edges are occupied by the atoms in the B and X sites.20–22 Specifically, the valence band maximum (VBM) is composed of a X-p electronic state, while the conduction band minimum (CBM) consists of a B-p electronic state. In other words, the main occupied electronic states at the band gap edge are directly related to the electronic and optical properties of the perovskite. There are many studies which demonstrate that the main occupied electronic states at the edge of the band gap can be efficiently tuned by constructing heterostructures.23–25 The heterostructures usually consist of a two-dimensional (2D) material layer and the perovskite layer.23–27 For instance, graphene/perovskite,23,24 black phosphorus/perovskite25 and transition metal sulfide (TMS)/perovskite have been confirmed to have significantly enhanced photovoltaic performances compared with pure perovskites. Hence it is beneficial to incorporate 2D materials to improve the optical capability of perovskites. Among the numerous 2D materials, monolayer cadmium chalcogenides, CdX (X = S, Se, Te) have been achieved by means of colloidal templates28,29 and solvent evaporation.30 Furthermore, it has been revealed in experiments that the incorporation of a CdS monolayer can remarkably enhance the optical response of the perovskite.26,27,31,32 In particular, the CdS/perovskite heterostructure is confirmed to have a high photocurrent and responsivity compared to the pure perovskite,26,32 which implies that it is a promising candidate for photoelectric applications.
Based on the aforementioned analysis, there are currently the following issues. Firstly, is the CdS/FAPbI3 heterostructure stable? Secondly, how are the electronic charges transferred? Thirdly, what is the strain effect on the band gap? Therefore, in this paper the electronic and optical properties of the perovskite-based heterostructure CdS/FAPbI3 are systematically studied to address the issues via first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT).
2 Computational methods
First-principles calculations based on DFT have been carried out with the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).33,34 The electron–ion interaction is dealt with using the projector augmented wave (PAW),35 and the exchange–correlation potential is in the form of GGA-PBE (PBE: Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof) under the generalized gradient approximation (GGA).36 DFT-D3,37 proposed by Grimme, is adopted to characterize the dispersion correction. For the present work, the valence electrons for the component elements are configured as Cd (4d105s2), S (3s23p4), Pb (5d106s26p2), I (5s25p5), C (2s22p2), N (2s22p3), H (1s1). As for Brillouin zone sampling, a Γ-centered 5 × 5 × 1 κ-point mesh is chosen for the CdS layer, and a Γ-centered 4 × 4 × 1 κ-point mesh is used for the FAPbI3 layer and the CdS/FAPbI3 heterostructure. A cutoff energy of 500 eV is set for the plane wave basis, and the convergence criteria for the total energy change and atomic force are thresholds of 1 × 10−5 eV and 0.02 eV Å−1, respectively, both of which are sufficiently accurate based on the preliminary test. To ensure good convergence, the conjugate gradient algorithm is adopted for lattice optimization, while the tetrahedron method with Blöchl corrections is used for the total energy calculations.
In addition, the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) interaction is also taken into account here because it has serious influence on the heavy metal Pb, and the Pb-6p electronic orbital in particular.38 As is well known, the calculations of GGA-PBE based on DFT usually underestimate the band gap, and hence it is necessary to adopt the time-consumed hybrid functional of HSE0639,40 (HSE: Herd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof), to obtain the exact electronic band structures. The exchange–correlation energy in HSE06 is described as, ECHSEX = ηESRX(μ) + (1 − η)EPBE,SRX(μ) + EPBE,LRX(μ) + EPBEC,(2)with the parameters of the mixing factor η and screening factor μ. The electron–electron interactions in the exchange term consist of two parts, a short-range part (SR) and a long-range part (LR). In particular, the LR and the correlation term are in the form of the PBE density functional, while the SR is involved in Fock exchange and the corresponding PBE counterpart.
With respect to the investigated CdS/FAPbI3 heterostructure, both the lattice relaxation and self-consistent calculations are at the GGA-PBE level with a Γ-centered κ-point of a 4 × 4 × 1 grid. By contrast, the optical properties and strain effect are treated at the level of GGA-PBE with a denser Γ-centered κ-point of a 6 × 6 × 1 grid, while the electronic density of states (DOS) is at the HSE + SOC level with a looser κ-point of a 3 × 3 × 1 grid, limited by the computational resources and time limitations.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Geometric structure
The perovskite-based heterostructure CdS/FAPbI3, as shown in Fig. 1, is constructed by a 2 × 2 CdS supercell and a 1 × 1 FAPbI3 (001) layer in the present work, in which the lattice mismatch ratio has the definition of, (3)

The parameters of ai and ci (I = 1, 2) indicate the lattice constants of the two components in the heterostructure. Obviously, the lattice mismatch rate is lower than 4% here. The lattice parameters of the component layers of FAPbI3 and CdS are a1 = 8.982 Å, c1 = 10.456 Å and a2 = 8.652 Å, c2 = 16.842 Å, respectively, as shown in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 1, there are 56 atoms in the CdS/FAPbI3 heterostructure, including 4 Cd, 4 S, 4 Pb, 12 I atoms and 4 FA molecules. There are three possible cases to be considered with different rotation angles of 0°, 60° and 120°.

To evaluate the relative stability of the CdS/FAPbI3 heterostructure, the binding energy is calculated according to the formula, Eb = ECdS/FAPbI3 − EFAPbI3(001) − ECdS(4)
The Ei (i = CdS/FAPbI3, FAPbI3 (001), or CdS) indicates the total energy of the CdS/FAPbI3 heterostructure, the FAPbI3 (001) layer, or the CdS layer, respectively. The binding energies for the cases with rotation angles of 0°, 60° and 120° are −1.024 eV, −1.214 eV, and −1.15 eV, respectively. In other words, it is favorable to synthesize the aforementioned heterostructures, because the reactions involved are all exothermic. The case with a rotation angle of 60° is focused on because it has the lowest binding energy among these. When comparing with the other vdW heterostructures,41–44 the binding energy per unit surface (eV Å−2) is adopted to ensure the unification of standards. By comparison, it is more favorable to synthesize the CdS/FAPbI3 heterostructure due to the lower binding energy. In addition, the relaxed layer-distances for the cases with rotation angles of 0°, 60° and 120° are 2.656 Å, 2.182 Å and 2.087 Å, respectively. It is hence substantiated that the interaction between CdS and FAPbI3 is significantly stronger compared with those in the common van der Waals heterostructures, which implies that the investigated CdS/FAPbI3 possesses good stability.
3.2 Electronic properties
In this section the electronic properties of the CdS/FAPbI3 heterostructure are discussed in detail, including the electronic DOS, band structure, charge density distribution in the band gap edge, and Bader charge analysis.

3.2.1 Electronic DOS and band structure. 
In previous studies,17,45 CdS and FAPbI3 were found to have band gaps of 2.94 eV, and 1.45 eV, respectively, which means that there is a possibility of tuning the band gap by constructing the CdS/FAPbI3 heterostructure. As predicted, Fig. 2(c) shows the CdS/FAPbI3 is a semiconductor with a direct bandgap of 1.23 eV. Moreover, the DOS in Fig. 2(b) shows that the VBM is mainly occupied by S-3p, Cd-4d and I-5p electronic states, while the CBM mostly consists of Pb-6p and I-5p electronic states. To get more insight into the intrinsic properties of the CdS/FAPbI3 heterostructure, the charge density is next explored, involving the charge density distributions at the band gap edge and the charge density difference (CDD)

The Fermi level is referenced with the VBM, and set to zero, as denoted by the vertical/horizontal black dashed line in (a) and (b). As for the band structure (c), the red refers to the CdS layer, and the blue indicates the FAPbI3 layer, in line with the total electronic DOS shown in (a). 


3.2.2 Charge density distributions at the VBM and CBM. 

Fig. 3 shows the charge density distribution at the bandgap edge. For the VBM, the charge density mainly distribute on the CdS and the neighbouring layer of the FAPbI3. For the CBM, the charge density is primarily located in the FAPbI3 layer. Hence the charge density distributions at the VBM and CBM are consistent with the electronic DOS shown in Fig. 2. Furthermore, Fig. 3 implies that the generation of electron–hole pairs originates from the charge transfer from the CdS layer to the FAPbI3 layer under light irradiation.

3.2.3 CDD. 
To probe the electron transfer at the interface between the CdS layer and the FAPbI3 layer, the charge density difference is analyzed here using the definition, Δρ = ρCdS/FAPbI3 − ρFAPbI3(001) − ρCdS,(5)in which the charge density difference is obtained by subtracting the electronic charge of the corresponding CdS layer and the FAPbI3 (001) layer from the CdS/FAPbI3 heterostructure. Note that ρi (i = CdS/FAPbI3, FAPbI3(001), CdS) denotes the electronic charge of the CdS/FAPbI3 heterostructure, the CdS layer and the FAPbI3 (001) layer, respectively, in the same system. As shown in Fig. 4, it is significant that charge transfer happens at the interface of the CdS/FAPbI3 heterostructure. Specifically, charge accumulation occurs in the CdS layer, while charge depletion exists in the FAPbI3 layer. As for the charge transfer of the component elements, this will be explored by means of Bader charge analysis.

The component CdS and FAPbI3 are both in their neutral state before constructing the CdS/FAPbI3 heterostructure shown in Table 2. There is a significant enhancement of the charge transfer in the CdS/FAPbI3 heterostructure compared with the individual CdS or FAPbI3. In addition, it is revealed that the CdS monolayer obtains electronic charge while FAPbI3 loses electronic charge, which is in line with the CDD in Fig. 4.

3.3 Optical properties
The absorption coefficients of the investigated systems can be calculated using the frequency-dependent complex dielectric constant ε(ω) = ε1(ω) +ε2(ω), in the following form,46 (6)where the parameter ω is the frequency of the incident light. The imaginary part ε2 in the complex dielectric function can be described as,47 (7)where Ω, κ, , r individually represent the volume of the primitive cell, the κ-point in the reciprocal space, the momentum operator and the external field vector, respectively. The parameter Ψvκ(Ψcκ) denotes the eigenwave function in the occupied state (the unoccupied state). The real part of the dielectric constant can be obtained by the well-known Kramers–Kronig (KK) relation,48,49 (8)where P stands for the principle part of the integration.

Fig. 5 depicts the simulated absorption spectrum for the CdS/FAPbI3 heterostructure compared with those for the individual bulk CdS and FAPbI3. As for FAPbI3 in the visible-light range, the order of magnitude of the absorption coefficient is up to 105 in units of cm−1, while the value of the CdS is only 104. In other words, the calculated absorption spectra of individual CdS and FAPbI3 are both in good accordance with previous reports,18,50–52 which means that the results here are reliable. The absorption coefficient of FAPbI3 in the visible light range of spectrum is remarkably enhanced by constructing the CdS/FAPbI3 heterostructure. Additionally, by comparing with recent reports,53–56 it is indicated that the optical performance of CdS/FAPbI3 in the visible-light range is superior to that of the others. In this respect, the construction of the CdS/FAPbI3 heterostructure is favorable for highly efficient optoelectronic applications.

3.4 Strain effect
In experiments it is almost inevitable for compressive or tensile strain to arise due to lattice mismatch, epitaxial growth or bending. It has been widely confirmed that the strain effect has a remarkable influence on the electronic structures and properties of materials. Hence it is interesting to study the strain effect systematically in detail, specifically including the binding energy, the DOS, the band gap and the alignment of the band gap edge. Here the lattice strain effect is simulated according to the definition, (9)with the parameters c and c0 corresponding to the lattice parameters with and without interfacial strain, respectively.

Fig. 6 shows that the band gap and the binding energy significantly vary with the interfacial uniaxial strain ranging from −6% to 6%. As for the band gap, it monotonically increases with strain on the x-direction ranging from −6% to 4%, while for the y-direction the range is from −6% to 2%. And the band gap monotonically decreases with compression strain from 4% to 6%. As for the binding energy, it is endothermic with respect to the compressive strain, while it is exothermic for tensile strain. And the binding energy always increases whether is compressive or tensile, although the compression effect is stronger than the tensile one. In other words, it is obvious that the equilibrium structure without strain corresponds to the lowest binding energy, which implies that the structure without strain is more stable than the others with strain. Additionally, the energy level alignments of the band gap edge under uniaxial strain are shown in Fig. 7. By contrast, the CBM and the VBM under x-direction strain almost keep increasing monotonically. Meanwhile, it is clearly unveiled that the y-direction strain effect on the VBM is remarkably stronger than that on the CBM, which is in line with the results shown in Fig. 6.

 Fig. 7  The energy level alignment of the band gap edge with different strains in the x/y-direction, distinguished in black and blue, respectively. Note that this is only at the level of GGA-PBE. 
The biaxial stain is next discussed. In Fig. 8, it is shown that the electronic density of states (DOS) for the investigated system apparently varies with different strains, which implies that strain can effectively tune the electronic properties of the CdS/FAPbI3 heterostructure. Limited by computational resources and time limitations, the strain effect on the DOS is simulated in the range −4% to 4%. Specifically, the band gaps for a compressive strain of 1% to 4% are 1.04 eV, 1.27 eV, 1.13 eV and 1.40 eV, respectively. By contrast, for a tensile strain of −1% to −4%, the band gaps are 0.7 eV, 1.15 eV, 0.93 eV and 1.07 eV, respectively. It is hence demonstrated that the band gap is efficiently tuned by double-axial strain. In particular, a double-axial strain of 2% and 4% is more favorable to achieve superior optical absorption in the visible-light range of the spectrum. As for the tensile strain, it is obviously not suitable for photovoltaic application due to the narrow band gap. It is hence unveiled that the appropriate strain can be used to improve the photovoltaic performance.

4 Conclusions
In the present work, the electronic and optical properties of the CdS/FAPbI3 heterostructure have been systematically studied by means of first-principles calculations. The main results are listed as follows.
There are three kinds of CdS/FAPbI3 heterostructure with different rotation angles of 0°, 60° and 120° to be considered, and that with a rotation angle of 60° is the most stable. The layer distances between CdS and FAPbI3 (001) in the optimized structures are all less than 3.0 Å, which means that the CdS/FAPbI3 heterostructure is more stable relative to common van der Waals heterostructures. The DOS demonstrates that the VBM and the CBM are occupied by electronic states from different component layers, which means a low electron–hole recombination ratio. Moreover, both Bader charge analysis and CDD show that there is significant electronic charge transfer from FAPbI3 to CdS. Meanwhile, the absorption coefficient in the visible-light range is remarkably enhanced in the CdS/FAPbI3 heterostructure compared to pure FAPbI3, which is attributed to the incorporation of CdS. Additionally, it is further unveiled that the band gap of the investigated CdS/FAPbI3 heterostructure can be effectively tuned by uniaxial or biaxial stain, although the binding energy without strain is the smallest. These results are helpful to deeply understand the intrinsic characteristics of the monolayer chalcogenide/perovskite heterostructure, which is useful to achieve highly efficient photovoltaic devices.
