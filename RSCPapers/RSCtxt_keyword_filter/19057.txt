    , Accepted 22nd May 2020First published on 22nd May 2020AbstractAll-inorganic heterostructures have attracted intense interest for new energy and environmental applications recently, especially in photoelectronic devices. Herein, we firstly obtain a novel CoIn2S4 thiospinel octahedron through a simple one-step hydrothermal synthesis method. On this basis we further propose a strategy to prepare all-inorganic heterostructures (NH4)4CoII[CoIIW12O40]·20H2O/CoIn2S4 (CoW12-n/CoIn2S4, where n represents the molar number of CoW12) through doping Keggin-type polyoxometalates (POMs). The addition of POMs can alleviate the cross-growth of the CoIn2S4 octahedron and increase the specific surface area and the number of exposed active sites of the heterostructures. What's more, we investigate the electrocatalytic triiodide reduction properties of the heterostructures. Electrochemical measurements show that POM contents have an obvious influence on the catalytic activity of this heterostructure catalyst. The CoW12-0.3/CoIn2S4 heterostructures present the best catalytic performance and the lowest charge transfer resistance. Consequently, the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with CoW12-0.3/CoIn2S4 heterostructures as a counter electrode (CE) show the highest photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 6.79%, superior to that of the Pt CE (5.83%). This work not only provides an approach for designing composites for efficient electrocatalytic triiodide reduction, but also represents a further step towards the application of all-inorganic heterostructures in photoelectronic devices.
1. Introduction
Since the beginning of the 21st century, the continuous development of science and technology has been deepening the degree of industrialization and also increasing the global dependence on energy.1–4 Solar energy has proven to be a clean and sustainable energy and may become a promising alternative to traditional fossil fuels because it can meet all the needs of the next generation for sustainable energy.5,6 Currently, solar energy has been extensively studied in photovoltaic devices, photocatalytic H2 production, N2 fixation, etc. Among them, directly converting solar energy into available electricity by solar cells, especially dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), is an attractive environmentally friendly technology due to its low cost, simple manufacturing process and stable performance.7 In DSSCs, the counter electrode (CE) plays an important role in reducing triiodide in the electrolyte and collects the electrons from the external circuit, so the CE materials are required to possess good electrocatalytic properties and conductivity.8 Platinum (Pt), a precious metal, is a traditional highly active electrode material used in DSSCs, but it still has some shortcomings for practical application. For example, (a) Pt is expensive and of low abundance in nature.9 (b) Pt shows poor stability, tending to oxidation and dissolution when exposed to air and I−/I3− electrolytes, thus forming PtI4 or H2PtI6.10 (c) Pt is not an effective CE catalyst material for other electrolytes such as cobalt complexes.11 Therefore, it is urgent to look for an efficient but low cost catalytic material to replace the Pt CE in the field of DSSCs.
CoIn2S4 is an important composite metal thiospinel with a spinel structure. Spinel was originally a kind of mineral that widely exists in nature. Later, scientists have classified it as a type of material because of a similar structure of this compound. Spinel belongs to the ionic compound; its general molecular formula is AB2X4, where A and B represent different metal cations, and X represents anions such as F, Cl, O, S and Se.12,13 In the spinel structure, A–X and B–X are strong ionic bonds, and the electrostatic bond strength is equal, so the spinel compounds have stable chemical properties, high melting point and high hardness. Meanwhile, it also possesses good thermal stability because both thermal conductivity and expansibility of spinel remain the same in all directions on account of its cubic crystal system, and the expansion coefficient is small.14–17 In recent years, it has been found that spinel compounds can be used as a high performance catalytic material due to the hole defects and large surface energy in spinel structures. Recently, more and more studies on spinel compounds especially for CoIn2S4 have been reported. Tang et al. firstly reported the CoIn2S4 as a novel highly efficient catalyst for catalyzing the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions, and further used it as an air-cathode for rechargeable Zn-Air batteries.18 In the same vein, Xiao et al. proposed that MIn2S4 (M = Fe, Co, Ni) are excellent catalytic material substitutes for the Pt CE in DSSCs.19 However, the research to date has tended to focus on making CoIn2S4 into nanosheet structures for catalysis. Although this nanosheet structure is beneficial to increase the specific surface area of the material, it is easy to collapse and damage during the long-term working process. Therefore, a key issue we focused on is how to simultaneously ensure the better stability and larger specific surface area of MIn2S4 materials.
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are a class of inorganic metal oxygen cluster compounds formed by octahedral structural units connected by transition metal elements and oxygen atoms through common angles or edges.20–23 Due to their diverse structures, natural nanoscale dimensions and unique high-charge properties, POMs can be combined with many functional materials such as graphene and metal–organic frameworks to obtain high-performance composites.24,25 At the same time, the reversible redox characteristics and excellent catalytic properties of POMs make them and their composites to be be widely used in various electrocatalytic fields.26–30 Keggin-type POMs ([XM12O40]n−) are the most representative class of constituents in the POM family, which are composed of the addenda atoms (M) and the heteroatom (X). Except for the abovementioned features, Keggin-type POMs also have the advantages of good hydrophilicity and a simple and non-toxic manufacturing process. Most importantly, they can carry out a multi-electron redox reaction but not changing the original structure, and their reduced and oxidized states can exist simultaneously and stably, as well as they can be more easily combined with other materials to form new functional materials since they are negatively charged.
Herein, we artificially synthesized a CoIn2S4 thiospinel with a uniform octahedral structure. As far as we know, there is no previous report on the artificial synthesis of the octahedral CoIn2S4 structure. Besides, we further proposed a strategy to prepare CoW12/CoIn2S4 heterostructures through a simple one-step hydrothermal synthesis method. The abundant holes in the spinel make its surface possess some positive charges, which is beneficial to build intense interaction between spinel and POM oxygen cluster anions when they come in contact in solution. Consequently, the prepared heterostructures retain the original CoIn2S4 octahedron structure, and exhibit a larger specific surface area and more catalytically active sites by alleviating the serious cross-growth of the octahedron. Finally, the obtained CoW12/CoIn2S4 heterostructure is firstly used as an outstanding CE for DSSCs. Photochemical characterization shows that the heterostructure shows better electrocatalytic performance than Pt. The photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of DSSCs based on the CoW12/CoIn2S4 heterostructure CE can reach 6.79%, which is higher than that of the Pt based-DSSCs (5.83%). The superior activity and stability of CoW12/CoIn2S4 heterostructures stem from the double characteristics of the POM and spinel, as well as the synergistic effect between them.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis and characterization of CoW12/CoIn2S4 heterostructures
The preparation of the CoIn2S4 and CoW12/CoIn2S4 heterostructures was carried out by a simple one-step hydrothermal synthesis method. Fig. 1a shows IR spectra of CoW12, CoIn2S4 and CoW12/CoIn2S4. It can be seen that there are three characteristic peaks (W–Oa, W–Ob–W, and W–Oc–W) of Keggin-type phosphotungstic acid in the range of 700–1100 cm−1, indicating that CoW12 exists in the composite and the POM structure is not destroyed in the hydrothermal reaction. As shown in Fig. 1b, XRD analysis of the CoW12/CoIn2S4 elucidated that the dominant phase of the composite was CoIn2S4 with diffraction peaks at 23.77°, 27.95°, 33.86°, 44.46°, 48.65°, 54.83°, 57.05°, 68.03°, and 78.15°, which could be assigned to the (220), (311), (400), (511), (440), (620), (533), (731), and (751) planes of spinel-type CoIn2S4 (JCPDS: 31-0421).

Fig. 2 compares the changes of the surface morphology of the material before and after CoW12 doping. CoIn2S4 has an octahedral shape and grows evenly and interleaved on FTO substrates (Fig. 2a). A higher magnification SEM image is shown in the upper right corner of Fig. 2a. The surface of the octahedral CoIn2S4 is slightly uneven with many indentations. Such a surface increases the specific surface area of the material compared to a smooth surface, indicating that more accessible active sites are obtained. In addition, the shape of the octahedron also has superiority to the sheet structure, such as robust and stable characteristics, this is why an increasing amount of literature on octahedral materials has been reported in recent years.31–33 After CoW12 doping, many nanoparticles are attached to the surface of the regular octahedron shaped CoIn2S4, which also proves that CoW12/CoIn2S4 heterostructures were successfully prepared (Fig. 2b). The addition of POM alleviates the serious cross-growth problem of the CoIn2S4 octahedron. CoW12/CoIn2S4 heterostructures also become porous upon addition of POMs, which will facilitate the increase of the specific surface area and the diffusion of I−/I3− in electrons and electrolytes. EDX spectra and elemental mapping of CoW12/CoIn2S4 are shown in Fig. S1 and S2,† respectively, which proves that the heterostructure material is composed of five elements such as O, S, In, Co, and W without the doping of other elements. The quantitative analysis of each element is shown in Table S1.† The increase in the specific surface area of the heterostructures can be further identified via N2 adsorption–desorption measurement. As shown in Fig. S3,† it is apparent that the isotherm curves present a typical IV profile with a classical H3-type hysteresis loop; it shows that both CoIn2S4 and CoW12/CoIn2S4 are mesoporous structures in good condition.18,34,35 CoIn2S4 exhibits a large BET specific surface area of 121 m2 g−1 based on the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) theory, whereas the BET specific surface area of CoW12/CoIn2S4 is larger (217 m2 g−1) which can significantly increase the number of exposed active sites and promote efficient transport of I3− and electrons, indicating that CoW12/CoIn2S4 is equipped with the conditions to become an excellent electrocatalyst.

The element composition and chemical state of CoW12/CoIn2S4 can be confirmed by XPS. Fig. 3a shows the full XPS spectrum of CoW12/CoIn2S4. It is clear that the composite has Co, O, In, S, and W, which is consistent with the EDS spectra results. Fig. 3b displays the high-resolution Co 2p spectrum; the binding energies at around 782.1 and 797.3 eV refer to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, which can be assigned to Co–S bonds.36 The binding energies at around 784.3 and 799.1 eV can also be attributed to Co–S bonds. The binding energies at 778.5 eV and 804.1 eV correspond to the formation of Co–O bonds, which may be attributed to the oxidation of Co2+ to Co3+ on or near the surface of the heterostructures.37 Co3+ mainly comes from both CoIn2S4 and CoW12. Fig. 3c shows the high-resolution In 3d spectrum; the binding energies at 453.4 eV and 445.8 eV correspond to the In 3d3/2 and In 3d5/2 of In3+.38Fig. 3d shows the high-resolution S 2p spectrum; the binding energies at 160.7 eV and 162.4 eV correspond to the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 of S2−, which can be attributed to Co-S or In-S species.37 Besides, the other two binding energies correspond to the S–O bond which can be attributed to the partial oxidation of S. The high-resolution W 4f spectrum can be seen in Fig. 4e; two peaks at 35.8 eV and 37.0 eV are attributed to the W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2 core levels of W6+, which is ascribed to the presence of W–O bonds in CoW12.26 The XPS analysis of pure CoIn2S4 is presented in Fig. S3.† Interestingly, data comparison from Fig. 3 and Fig. S4† shows that the peaks of Co 2p in CoW12/CoIn2S4 heterostructures obviously shift toward higher binding energy. This phenomenon indicates a strong electronic interaction between CoIn2S4 and CoW12, which may arise from the intimate interface between the spinel with a large number of holes and the POM as a polyanionic oxygen cluster.

2.2 Electrochemical measurements of CoW12/CoIn2S4 heterostructures

Fig. 4a shows the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra of Pt, CoIn2S4, CoW12-0.1/CoIn2S4, CoW12-0.3/CoIn2S4, and CoW12-0.6/CoIn2S4 CEs, also known as the Nyquist plots, which can effectively analyze the electron transfer process between the electrolyte and electrode interface, and further explore the catalytic performance of CEs. The experiment was carried out in acetonitrile containing 0.50 M LiClO4, 0.05 M LiI, and 0.01 M I2 by using CE/electrolyte/CE symmetrical cells. In Nyquist plots, two distinct semicircles can be clearly seen. The fitted circuit from the Randles model is shown in the upper left corner of Fig. 4a. The high frequency region on the horizontal axis represents the series impedance (Rs) of the symmetrical battery, and the semicircle on the left is in the high frequency range which represents the charge transfer resistance (Rct) in the interface of the electrolyte and CE, which can proclaim the electrochemical redox process between the electrolyte and CE. The right semicircle in the low frequency range reflects the Nernst diffusion impedance (Zw) of the redox couple in the electrolyte.39 All the Nyquist plots were fitted using the ZsimpWin software based on the equivalent circuit and the fitting parameters of Rs, Rct, and Zw as listed in Table S2.† Faster reaction kinetics and better electrical conductivity are very important for DSSCs. Rct is considered to be another key point for revealing the electron transfer process and can be used to evaluate the catalytic activity of the CE. The smaller the Rct, the better the electrocatalytic activity of the material.40 As seen in Table S2,† CoIn2S4 (Rct = 17.35 Ω cm−2) has smaller Rct than Pt (Rct = 20.36 Ω cm−2), and the Rct of heterostructures also decreases after the doping of the POM. The Rct of CoW12-0.1/CoIn2S4 is 11.52 Ω cm−2 and the Rct of CoW12-0.3/CoIn2S4 is 5.93 Ω cm−2. However, as the content of the POM further increases, the Rct of heterostructures also increases. The Rct of CoW12-0.6/CoIn2S4 is 22.25 Ω cm−2, which is larger than Rct of Pt. In summary, CoW12-0.3/CoIn2S4 possesses the best catalytic activity among all the composites, and even better than precious metal Pt, although it has a little bit larger Zw than Pt.
Besides, the Tafel polarization curve further illustrates the catalytic activity of the I−/I3− redox couple at the CE in DSSCs. Fig. 4b provides Tafel polarization curves of CEs with all the electrode materials. The Tafel polarization test was performed in the acetonitrile solution containing 0.50 M LiClO4, 0.05 M LiI, and 0.01 M I2 as the supporting electrolyte from −0.6–0.6 V. The Tafel polarization curve can be divided into three regions: polarization region, Tafel region and diffusion region. These three regions provide important references for the catalytic activity of the material. In fact, the exchange current density (Jo) and the limit diffusion current density (Jlim) are equivalent to the Tafel region and the diffusion region, respectively, and they can be used to evaluate the electron exchange rate when different CE materials reduce I3−.41 In addition, the Tafel region is determined by the slope of the cathode branch. A larger slope in the cathode branch represents that a higher Jo. Jo can be obtained by deriving the Tafel curve.41 As presented in Fig. 4b, CoW12-0.3/CoIn2S4 has the largest slope in the cathode branch of the Tafel region, suggesting that Jo is also the largest, which further proves that CoW12-0.3/CoIn2S4 has the highest electron exchange rate when reducing I3−.
In DSSCs, a cyclic voltammetry (CV) test can accurately evaluate the reaction kinetics and electrocatalytic activity of the CEs to the electrolyte redox. The electrolyte for the CV test contained 0.50 M LiClO4, 0.05 M LiI, and 0.01 M I2 in the acetonitrile solution. The scan rate of the CV test was 50 mV s−1. Fig. 5 shows the CV test curve for the I−/I3− redox reaction of various CEs. It can be clearly seen that there are two pairs of redox peaks corresponding to the oxidation of I− to I3− and the reduction of I3− to I−. The reaction of I3− + 2e− = 3I− (1) occurs at Red-1 and the reaction of 3I−–2e− = I3− (2) occurs at Ox-1. The non-electrochemical reaction of I3− = I2 + I− (3) is also involved in reaction (1), which leads to two-electron transfer reactions of I2 + 2e− = 2I− (4) at Red-2 and 2I−–2e− = I2 (5) at Ox-2.42 At the same time, the current density corresponding to both oxidation and reduction peaks can evaluate the reaction rate of iodine ions on the surface of the CE material. Besides, the amplitude Epp between the oxidation peak and the reduction peak is also a key factor for measuring the CE material. The smaller Epp of the CE material suggests that this material possessed more satisfactory catalytic performance for the I3− reduction. CoW12-0.3/CoIn2S4 has the highest peak current and the smallest Epp, indicating that electrons can be quickly transferred on the heterostructure material, and promote I−/I3− mutual conversion (Fig. 5). The synergistic action and structural integration of spinel-type composite sulfide and POM, as well as the close interfacial connection formed by electrostatic interaction, are responsible for the heterostructures with excellent electrocatalytic performances. The addition of POM eases the cross-growth of CoIn2S4 in the shape of an octahedron, and increases the specific surface area and active sites, which is beneficial for the improvement of electrocatalytic performance.
 Fig. 5  CV test curve at 50 mV s−1 sweep speeds with various CEs. 

Fig. 6a shows CoW12-0.3/CoIn2S4 CV test curves at different sweep speeds. As the scan rate increases, the oxidation peak gradually moves in the positive direction, and the reduction peak gradually moves in the negative direction. Meanwhile, the peak current density has an upward trend. It can be judged that the reduction of I3− to I− in the electrolyte is mainly controlled by ion diffusion in the electrolyte.43 Moreover, we also explore the relationship between the redox peak currents and the square root of scan rates. As shown in Fig. 6b, we conclude that the peak current of oxidation (or reduction) is linearly related to the square root of the sweep speed from the fitted data. Pearson's correlation coefficient (Pearson's r) is usually used to indicate the degree of linear correlation between two random variables. When Pearson's r = ±1, the two random variables are considered to be completely linearly related, or the two random variables are considered to be linearly independent when Pearson's r = 0.44 The absolute values of Pearson's r of our fitted functions are all greater than 0.97, which proves that the peak current of oxidation (or reduction) has a strong linear correlation with the square root of the sweep speed. It is also proved that the reduction of I3− in our experiment is mainly controlled by the ion diffusion in the electrolyte, and no special chemical reaction occurs between the CE and the electrolyte.19

2.3 Characterization of photovoltaic performances of CoW12/CoIn2S4 heterostructures
We assembled different CEs into DSSC and tested the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves. Fig. 7 and Table 1 display the J–V curves and related data of DSSCs fabricated with different CEs under 100 mW cm−2 illumination. The single spinel material CoIn2S4 as the CE shows a great PCE (6.27%) with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.744 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.55 and a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 15.38 mA cm−2, which is similar to that of the Pt CE; thus CoIn2S4 has great electrocatalytic potential and potential application in DSSCs. The CE materials were controlled by adding POMs with different contents to CoIn2S4. The synergistic effect between POMs and spinel, as well as the large specific surface area of the heterostructures, improved the photovoltaic performance of the DSSC. The photovoltaic performance of the CoW12/CoIn2S4 CE is superior to that of Pt and pure CoIn2S4. The DSSC with CoW12-0.1/CoIn2S4 possesses a higher PCE (6.63%). Notably, the PCE of 6.79% was achieved with a Jsc of 15.85 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.728 V and a FF of 0.59 when the CoW12-0.3/CoIn2S4 heterostructure was applied as the CE, which exceeds the PCE of DSSCs with traditional Pt CEs a lot. Interestingly, when the contents of the POM increased further, the photoelectric performance of the DSSC decreased. The CoW12-0.6/CoIn2S4 based DSSCs achieved a Voc of 0.712 V, a FF of 0.54, a Jsc of 15.23 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 5.90%. A possible explanation for this might be that the excessive doping of the POM results in an increase in the impedance of the heterostructures; it hinders the transmission of electrons and reduces the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs. Furthermore, the long-term stability of the CE also needs to be concerned. The stability of the DSSCs fabricated with CoW12-0.3/CoIn2S4 was measured for nearly a month to quantify the long-term stability of solar cells. The current density and PCE of the DSSCs based on CoW12-0.3/CoIn2S4 were almost unchanged throughout the 25 day operation (Fig. S5†). It can thus be suggested that CoW12-0.3/CoIn2S4 has an extremely superior long-term stability. The excellent stability may be attributed to the strong electrostatic interaction between CoW12 and CoIn2S4. The specific description is as follows: on the one hand, the transition metal cations Co and In play the pivotal role in the CoIn2S4 thiospinel. The empty σ bond of the transition metal Co at the A site needs to be partially filled owing to the empty σ bond caused by the low spin of In3+ at the B site. In this fashion, excess holes will be generated inside the thiospinel, and thus make CoIn2S4 carry some positive charge on its surface, namely, CoIn2S4 is a kind of hole-conducting P-type semiconductor. On the other hand, it is well known that POMs are a class of inorganic anion clusters that are negatively charged. Therefore, the strong electrostatic adsorption between CoW12 and CoIn2S4 is beneficial to the formation of a robust heterostructure catalyst, and shows outstanding stability towards electrocatalytic triiodide reduction.

3. Experimental section
3.1 Materials and methods

3.1.1 Synthesis and measurements. 
Co(NO3)2·6H2O, InCl3, and thioacetamide (TAA) were purchased from Aladdin Chemistry Co., Ltd. All reagents were used without further purification. FTO conducting glass was purchased from Advanced Election Technology Co., Ltd and ultrasonically cleaned with detergent solution, isopropanol and ethanol, respectively. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded using KBr pellets in the range of 4000–400cm−1 with a Bruker AXS TENSOR-27 FT-IR spectrometer. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed using a Rigaku D/max-2550 diffractometer utilizing Cu Kα radiation (k = 1.5418 Å). The physical morphologies of CoIn2S4 and the composite material CoW12/CoIn2S4 were confirmed using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) (Hitachi S-4800, Japan). Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out using a KRATOS, Axis UltraDLD spectrometer with Al Kα radiation as the X-ray source and the C 1s photoelectron peak at 284.60 eV as the internal reference. The electrochemical impedance and Tafel polarization measurements were performed using a Gamry Reference 3000 electrochemical workstation (Gamry Instruments, Inc, USA). Cyclic voltammetry was performed using a CHI601D electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co., Ltd, China), using an Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, the prepared CE as the working electrode, and a Pt wire as the counter electrode. All photoelectrochemical experiments were performed on a Solar Cell Current Voltage (I–V) Characteristic Measurement System (Zolix Instrument Co., Ltd, China) at room temperature.


3.1.2 Preparation of the POM. 
(NH4)4CoII[CoIIW12O40]·20H2O (CoW12) was synthesized according to the methods reported in the literature.45 Solution A was obtained by dissolving 0.6 mol Na2WO3·2H2O in 400 mL water and adjusting the pH of the solution to 6.5–7.5 with glacial acetic acid. Solution B was obtained by dissolving 0.1 mol Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O in 125 mL hot water and adding a few drops of glacial acetic acid. Afterwards, solution B was slowly added into the boiling solution A under stirring. When solution B was completely added to solution A, the solution mixture was refluxed for 10 minutes and filtered to remove the insoluble impurities. Finally, the filtrate is heated to boiling, and subsequently a small amount of boiling water solution containing 135 g of (NH4)CH3COO is added, and the resultant sample is cooled, and then filtered to obtain CoW12.


3.1.3 Preparation of the counter electrode. 
A one-step hydrothermal synthesis method was adopted to prepare the CoW12/CoIn2S4 CE. First, 0.30 mmol Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.75 mmol InCl3 and 1.50 mmol TAA were dissolved in 35 mL deionized water to obtain the precursor solution. Then, 0 mmol, 0.10 mmol, 0.30 mmol and 0.60 mmol of CoW12 were added to the precursor solution to prepare different CEs, respectively. According to the contents of the POM, the CEs were named CoIn2S4, CoW12-0.1/CoIn2S4, CoW12-0.3/CoIn2S4, and CoW12-0.6/CoIn2S4 respectively. The above mixed solution was magnetically stirred until completely dissolved, and then transferred to four Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclaves. The pretreated FTO was immersed in the mixed solution of the autoclaves. Afterward, the autoclave was sealed and maintained at 160 °C for 24 h. When the reaction completed and cooled down naturally, the FTO substrates grown with CoW12/CoIn2S4 were thoroughly rinsed with deionized water several times, followed by drying at 60 °C. Thus, CoIn2S4 and CoW12/CoIn2S4 CEs were fabricated successfully.


3.1.4 DSSC fabrication. 
The photoanodes and the redox electrolyte were prepared according to the literature.46–48 Put a layer of polyimide tape on both sides of the photoanode, and then overlap it with the CE and fix it with a steel clip. Use a syringe to inject the electrolyte into the gap between the photoanode and the CE through the siphon effect. The photoanode, electrolyte and pair electrode form a sandwich structure, and the assembled DSSC is obtained.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we firstly synthesized a novel CoIn2S4 octahedron and successfully prepared CoW12/CoIn2S4 heterostructures using simple fabrication processes on FTO substrates as CEs for Pt-free DSSCs. The synthesis and preparation of heterostructures are simple and non-toxic. N2 adsorption–desorption measurement demonstrated that the addition of the POM alleviated the cross-growth problem of CoIn2S4, which increased the specific surface area and the active site. In addition, we investigated the electrocatalytic triiodide properties of CoW12/CoIn2S4 heterostructures containing different contents of POMs. Nyquist, Tafel, and CV tests confirmed superior electrocatalytic properties of CoW12-0.3/CoIn2S4 heterostructures with low charge transfer resistance at the electrolyte/electrode junction. The CoW12-0.3/CoIn2S4 heterostructure CE-based DSSC provided higher PCE = 6.79% under simulated solar illumination, even better than that of Pt CE-based DSSCs (5.83%). The successful preparation of CoW12/CoIn2S4 heterostructures with precise shape control has offered opportunities for stable and efficient electrocatalytic triiodide reduction in photoelectronic devices.
