    , Accepted 24th July 2017First published on 25th July 2017AbstractAlternating and random conjugated copolymers with a siloxane-terminated side chain for a repeating unit based on 5,6-difluoro[2,1,3]benzothiadiazole (FBT) and quarterthiophene (4T) were synthesized, among which side-chain random copolymers PFBT4T-C5Si-50% and PFBT4T-C5Si-25% with low contents of 50% and 25% siloxane-terminated side chains, respectively, in conjunction with alkyl side chains were found to be more suitable for optoelectronic applications due to good film-forming in solution processing. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) indicated that the siloxane-terminated side chain could induce PFBT4T-C5Si-50% and PFBT4T-C5Si-25% with face-on orientations, giving high 3-D hole transport in neat films as supported by a high hole mobility up to 2.46 cm2 V−1 s−1 in field-effect transistors and an SCLC hole mobility up to 5.9 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 in hole-only devices. Fast SCLC hole and electron transports were seen for their bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) blend films with PC71BM as the acceptor, due to the retention of a polymer face-on orientation. The BHJ blend film of PFBT4T-C5Si-25% showed lower film surface roughness, more balanced hole and electron transport, and relatively smaller phase separation when compared with PFBT4T-C5Si-50%, as evidenced by atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), SCLC, and resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) measurements. The PFBT4T-C5Si-25%-based PSCs with 270, 420, and 600 nm thick active layers exhibited outstanding power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 10.39%, 11.09%, and 10.15%, respectively, readily offering a high thickness tolerance to achieve an unprecedented wide active layer processing window for PCE > 10%. This is also the first PCE of more than 10% achieved by an active layer of a 600 nm thickness level in PSCs. Another notable feature is very high fill factors of more than 74% and 71% being achieved for very thick active layers of 420 and 600 nm, respectively. The results suggest that side-chain engineering through the incorporation of a partial siloxane-terminated side chain is a unique handle to afford new photovoltaic polymers with enhanced vertical carrier transport towards application in roll-to-roll processing of PSCs.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) as a green energy technology have attracted much attention due to their advantages of flexibility, lightweight, and cost-effective roll-to-roll processing.1–7 In the past decade, great efforts have been devoted to develop various organic donor and acceptor materials, so as to enhance power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of BHJ PSCs.7–19 In a recent cost analysis for PSCs, industrial processing (100 GW) of single-junction PSCs with a module efficiency of 10% would lead to a module cost of 0.05 € per Wp, an encouraging value that competes with hydropower.20 For desired large area and high speed roll-to-roll printing, e.g. with 1–2 m width and at 1–3 m s−1, an ideal active layer should not only display outstanding PCE at an optimal thickness, but also maintain enough high PCEs when a large thickness variation occurs.2,21–23 However, most current organic active layer materials only perform best at ∼100 nm thickness and thicker active layers show obviously decreased efficiency, mainly due to slow carrier transports.24–26 Low band gap thieno[3,4-b]thiophene/benzodithiophene polymer PTB7 is such a typical example. In the report by Marks et al., PTB7:PC71BM-based PSCs showed PCEs of 7.98%, 6.63%, and 4.23% for 100, 195, and 300 nm thick active layers.24 For photovoltaic performances, it would be difficult to achieve quality control on large-scale roll-to-roll fabrication lines.
To overcome the efficiency drop of PSCs with thicker active layers or improve roll-to-roll compatibility, some notable advances have been achieved through developing high mobility polymer donors and improving the BHJ nanoscale morphology.21–23,27–36 Currently, it is still a major challenge to retain PCE > 10% with a few hundred nanometer variation of the active layer thickness (we define it as a challenge to open large active layer processing windows for PCE > 10%).
Side chains are necessary for conjugated polymers to realize solution processing; linear and branched alkyl side chains have been widely utilized for a long time.3,8,9,37,38 A siloxane-terminated side chain, a hetero- and far-branched pendant, was recently introduced in conjugated polymers for organic field-effect transistor (OFET) application.39–47 In a report by Bao et al. in 2011, it was found that the siloxane-terminated side chain could induce an unusual face-on orientation in the isoindigo-based alternating copolymer (PII2T), affording the polymer with face-on and edge-on dual orientations, while PII2T bearing a common alkyl side chain (2-octyldodecyl (OD)) only showed an edge-on orientation.39 Interestingly, the PII2T with face-on and edge-on dual orientations could display an order of magnitude higher hole mobility in OFETs when compared with the PII2T with only the edge-on orientation.39 Later the siloxane-terminated side chain induced face-on orientation was also observed for other conjugated polymers to achieve notably high ambipolar OFETs.41 Relative to the great endeavors and encouraging success of conjugated polymers with a siloxane-terminated side chain in OFETs, research reports of their photovoltaic properties are extremely scarce.42 Using the PII2T with a siloxane-terminated side chain as the polymer donor in BHJ PSCs only exhibited a PCE of 3.4%, much lower than a PCE of 5.2% for PII2T bearing the OD side chain.42 BHJ films of PII2T with a siloxane-terminated side chain showed unanticipated lower hole and electron mobilities as measured by the space-charge limited current (SCLC), when compared with PII2T bearing the OD side chain. The results imply that an efficient nanoscale morphology towards PSC application may not be established inside the BHJ films of PII2T with a siloxane-terminated side chain. In a PSC device, fast carrier transports along the vertical direction can decrease bimolecular recombination of holes and electrons in a BHJ active layer.48 Thus, the face-on orientation of a polymer donor is crucial to improve device performance in thick-film PSCs, supplying the possibility to enlarge the active layer processing window. Therefore it is desirable to develop some new design strategies for polymer donors with siloxane-terminated side chains.
In a previous report, a high OFET hole mobility (μh-OFET) of 1.92 cm2 V−1 s−1 was demonstrated with an alternating copolymer FBT-Th4(1,4) based on 5,6-difluoro[2,1,3]benzothiadiazole (FBT) and quarterthiophene (4T) (Fig. 1a).23 As measured by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD), the FBT-Th4(1,4) with the 2-decyltetradecyl (DT) side chain appears to have a texture of a very clear edge-on crystallite orientation and strong lamella stacking in an as-cast film, with an out-of-plain (OOP) (100) diffraction located at 0.27 Å−1, corresponding to a d-spacing of 23.2 Å and an in-plain (IP) π–π stacking peak located at 1.74 Å−1, giving a π–π distance of 3.61 Å. The edge-on orientation is beneficial for achieving the high hole mobility in OFETs; but when using FBT-Th4(1,4) as the polymer donor in PSCs, the edge-on texture may become a possible obstacle to enlarge an active layer processing window at a PCE > 10% level.34 For a PFBT4T analogue named PffBT4T-2OD with a shorter OD side chain, its photovoltaic efficiency shows a strong sensitivity to the active layer thickness, and the sensitivity is an obvious problem to define a practical active layer processing window.49

(b) Chemical structures of polymers PFBT4T-C5Si-100%, PFBT4T-C5Si-75%, PFBT4T-C5Si-50%, and PFBT4T-C5Si-25% with a sole or partial siloxane-terminated side chain in this study. 
In this study, side-chain engineering of PFBT4T polymers was investigated, in which a siloxane-terminated side chain was utilized to replace the DT side chain partially or totally (Fig. 1b). PFBT4T-C5Si-100% is an alternating copolymer with a sole siloxane-terminated side chain while PFBT4T-C5Si-75%, PFBT4T-C5Si-50%, and PFBT4T-C5Si-25% are side-chain random copolymers with both a siloxane-terminated side chain and a DT side chain. We observed that PFBT4T-C5Si-100% and PFBT4T-C5Si-75% showed poor film-forming behaviors while PFBT4T-C5Si-50% and PFBT4T-C5Si-25% with lower contents of siloxane-terminated side chains were better and more suitable for optoelectronic device applications. It was found that the partial siloxane-terminated side chain could induce a pronounced face-on orientation for PFBT4T-C5Si-50% and PFBT4T-C5Si-25% while the edge-on orientation was largely suppressed. In OFET devices, PFBT4T-C5Si-50% and PFBT4T-C5Si-25% displayed high hole mobilities of 0.65 and 2.46 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, confirming that a conjugated polymer of the face-on orientation can show fast hole transport along the lateral direction. Moreover, very high SCLC hole mobilities (μh-SCLC) of 5.9 × 10−2 and 3.3 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 were observed from their neat films in hole-only devices, indicating the fast hole transport along the vertical direction. Thus 3-D high mobility channels could be established in thin films of PFBT4T-C5Si-50% and PFBT4T-C5Si-25%. With PC71BM as the acceptor, PFBT4T-C5Si-50% and PFBT4T-C5Si-25% in PSC devices exhibited maximum PCEs of 9.25% and 11.09%, respectively. Delightedly, the PFBT4T-C5Si-25%-based PSCs with active layer thicknesses from 270 to 600 nm could show PCEs ≥ 10.15%, readily providing a wide active layer processing window for achieving PCE > 10%. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), GIXD, and resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) measurements were utilized to compare nanoscale morphologies of the active layers of PFBT4T-C5Si-50% and PFBT4T-C5Si-25%. At a ∼400 nm thickness level, lower film surface roughness, more balanced hole and electron transports, and relatively smaller phase separation observed for the PFBT4T-C5Si-25%-based active layer are the important factors that can contribute to its much better photovoltaic performances in PSCs.
Results and discussion
The synthetic routes to the key FBT2T-C5Si-Br monomer with a siloxane-terminated side chain and PFBT4T-C5Si series polymers are shown in Scheme 1 (see full synthetic details and characterization in the ESI†). The coupling reaction of 3-bromothiophene with the alkene-terminated alkyl Grignard reagent afforded compound 1 in a good yield of 82%. After lithiation and the subsequent reaction with tributyltin chloride, compound 1 was transferred to the organotin compound 2. The Stille coupling reaction of 2 and 4,7-dibromo-5,6-difluoro[2,1,3]benzothiadiazole readily gave compound 3 in a 81% yield. Compound 4 with two siloxane-terminated solubilizing chains was obtained in a good yield of 85% by the hydrosilylation of the terminal alkene with 1,1,1,3,5,5,5-heptamethyltrisiloxane in the presence of the Karstedt catalyst.39 The subsequent bromination effectively converted 4 to the dibromo monomer FBT2T-C5Si-Br. Another dibromo-monomer FBT2T-DT-Br comprising DT alkyl chains was synthesized according to the reported procedure.23 The PFBT4T-C5Si series polymers were prepared by Stille copolymerizations of distannylated 2,2′-bithiophene (2T-SnMe3) and the two dibromo-monomers. The yields for PFBT4T-C5Si-100%, PFBT4T-C5Si-75%, PFBT4T-C5Si-50%, and PFBT4T-C5Si-25% were 78%, 83%, 91%, and 93%, respectively. It should be noted that, in chemistry, the siloxane-terminated side chain is shorter than the DT alkyl chain, and a PFBT4T-C5Si polymer with a too high content of the siloxane-terminated side chain may encounter insufficient solubility. Molecular weights of the polymers were estimated by high temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at 140 °C (Table 1). Indeed, the four polymers showed continuously increasing number-averaged molecular weights (Mn) from 22 to 105.6 kg mol−1 along with a decreasing content of the siloxane-terminated side chain. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated that the four polymers showed no decomposition at 400 °C (Fig. S5, ESI†) and their temperatures for a 5% weight loss (Td) were between 429 and 444 °C (Table 1). No noticeable phase transitions were observed for the four polymers by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in the temperature range of 0–270 °C.

UV absorption spectra of dilute chlorobenzene (CB) solutions (1 × 10−5 M) of the four polymers at room temperature (RT) are shown in Fig. 2a. The solution of PFBT4T-C5Si-100% displayed a main absorption peak at 628 nm and a shoulder peak at 696 nm. The PFBT4T-C5Si-75% solution showed similar absorption behavior, but with a red shift of the main peak to 638 nm. For the solutions of PFBT4T-C5Si-50% and PFBT4T-C5Si-25%, their absorptions at ∼640 nm became the shoulder peaks and the main absorptions were located at the longer wavelengths of ∼700 nm, very close to that of FBT-Th4(1,4) with the DT side chain.23 The film absorption behaviors (Fig. 2b) of the four polymers were almost identical to the solution spectra, demonstrating that polymer chains in the RT solutions already established strong interchain aggregations. The absorption edges of films of the four polymers were comparable, and the estimated optical band gaps (Eg) were between 1.60 and 1.62 eV (Table 1). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of the polymers were obtained from the onset of oxidation potential (Eox) during cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements with an Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode and ferrocene as the internal standard (Fig. S6, ESI†). PFBT4T-C5Si-100% exhibited the lowest Eox of 0.39 V and the calculated HOMO level was −5.19 eV (Table 1). With the decreasing of the siloxane-terminated side chain in the random copolymers, larger Eox values were found, giving HOMO levels of −5.25, −5.32, and −5.34 eV for PFBT4T-C5Si-75%, PFBT4T-C5Si-50%, and PFBT4T-C5Si-25%, respectively. In the literature, a polymer donor with a lower-lying HOMO level is beneficial for achieving a higher Voc in BHJ PSCs.3 The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of the four polymers were derived from the corresponding HOMO level and Eg (Table 1).

(d) Photograph images of polymer solutions (4 mg mL−1) in chlorobenzene at room temperature (25 °C). From left to right for PFBT4T-C5Si-100%, PFBT4T-C5Si-75%, PFBT4T-C5Si-50%, and PFBT4T-C5Si-25%, respectively. The solutions of PFBT4T-C5Si-50% and PFBT4T-C5Si-25% formed organogels at the room temperature. 
Evolutions of the UV absorption spectra of dilute CB solutions (1 × 10−5 M) of the four polymers under a heating process from 25 to 95 °C were recorded to reveal their de-aggregation behaviors (Fig. 3). For PFBT4T-C5Si-50% and PFBT4T-C5Si-25%, their main absorptions at ∼700 nm, ascribed to an interchain aggregation, almost disappeared at 95 °C. But for PFBT4T-C5Si-100% and PFBT4T-C5Si-75%, their 95 °C hot solutions still retained the absorptions at ∼700 nm. Therefore, relative to the DT side chain, the siloxane-terminated side chain can afford much stronger interchain aggregation. Indeed, even with hot solutions (90 °C), thin films of PFBT4T-C5Si-100% and PFBT4T-C5Si-75% with much higher contents of the siloxane-terminated side chain could not be spin-coated smoothly (Fig. 2c). Cooling the solutions to room temperature, PFBT4T-C5Si-100% and PFBT4T-C5Si-75% formed suspensions, whereas PFBT4T-C5Si-50% and PFBT4T-C5Si-25%, the polymers with lower contents of the siloxane-terminated side chain, could form organogels (Fig. 2d). Fortunately, high quality films could be deposited from hot solutions of PFBT4T-C5Si-50% and PFBT4T-C5Si-25% (Fig. 2c). As measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM), the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of ∼290 nm thick PFBT4T-C5Si-50% and PFBT4T-C5Si-25% films are 4.51 and 1.69 nm, respectively (Fig. 4a and b). The larger surface roughness of the PFBT4T-C5Si-50% film also implies its relatively stronger main chain aggregation ability. For polymer:PC71BM BHJ blend films of ∼380 nm thickness for thick-film PSCs, the measured RMS roughness values of PFBT4T-C5Si-50% and PFBT4T-C5Si-25% are 7.67 and 2.98 nm, respectively (Fig. 4c and d). The PFBT4T-C5Si-25%:PC71BM blend film possesses a relatively smoother surface. Generally, the surfaces of the blend films are fairly good when considering such a large film thickness.

Based on the above-mentioned results, it is clear that side-chain random copolymers PFBT4T-C5Si-50% and PFBT4T-C5Si-25% have shown notable advantages including higher molecular weights, deeper HOMO levels for achieving a higher Voc, and better film-forming abilities when compared with PFBT4T-C5Si-100% and PFBT4T-C5Si-75% with much higher contents of the siloxane-terminated side chain. And thus PFBT4T-C5Si-50% and PFBT4T-C5Si-25% were selected for further film morphology and optoelectronic device characterization.
We fabricated OFET devices with a simple bottom-gate/top-contact configuration, in which a polymer film (∼50 nm) was spin-coated in a hot o-dichlorobenzene solution (90 °C, 5 mg mL−1) on an octadecyltrimethoxysilane (OTS)-treated SiO2 gate dielectric. Then a gold film (40 nm) was deposited under vacuum as the source and drain electrodes. The characterization of OFETs was performed under an ambient environment with a relative humidity of ∼75%. The OFET performances are listed in Table 2. The OFET output and transfer characteristics of PFBT4T-C5Si-50% and PFBT4T-C5Si-25% films annealed at 200 °C are shown in Fig. 5. At different gate voltages (VG), the drain current (IDS) of the device could reach saturation along with the drain voltage (VDS), and the μh-OFET was calculated from the slope of the transfer curve of (IDS)1/2vs. VG.

The OFET device based on the as-cast PFBT4T-C5Si-50% film exhibited a μh-OFET of 0.18 cm2 V−1 s−1. With thermal annealing at 100 °C, PFBT4T-C5Si-50% showed an increased hole mobility of 0.33 cm2 V−1 s−1. Under a higher annealing temperature of 200 °C, the mobility of the polymer was further elevated to 0.65 cm2 V−1 s−1. For PFBT4T-C5Si-25%, its as-cast film showed a μh-OFET of 0.39 cm2 V−1 s−1. Under the annealing treatments of 100 and 200 °C, μh-OFET values could be increased to 0.67 and 2.46 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The results demonstrated that PFBT4T-C5Si-25% with a lower content of siloxane-terminated side chains could exhibit much higher hole mobility in OFETs when compared with PFBT4T-C5Si-50%. Under thermal annealing at 200 °C, the OFETs of PFBT4T-C5Si-50% and PFBT4T-C5Si-25% displayed good on/off current ratios of 105 and threshold voltages close to 0 V (Fig. 5).
In the literature, most reports on high performance polymer OFETs were based on alternating copolymers.50–52 The maximum μh-OFET of PFBT4T-C5Si-25% is already higher than that of the FBT-Th4(1,4) alternating copolymers. Our results suggest that a side-chain random conjugated copolymer is an alternative candidate that can show a very high OFET mobility. GIXD was utilized to characterize its orientation features. The 2-D scattering images of PFBT4T-C5Si-50% and PFBT4T-C5Si-25% films annealed at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 6. Both polymers exhibited obvious face-on crystallite orientations that should be induced by the partial siloxane-terminated side chain, and only small amounts of edge-on crystallites could be found from 2-D scattering patterns, confirming that the face-on orientation could play a dominant role in the fast hole transport along the lateral direction in OFETs. As seen from the line-cuts of the as-cast PFBT4T-C5Si-50% film, the quite strong (100) diffraction was seen in the IP direction and sharp π–π stacking (010) was seen in the OOP direction. The IP (100) diffraction was located at 0.27 Å−1, corresponding to a d-spacing of 23.2 Å for interdigitation of side chains; the OOP (010) peak was located at 1.78 Å−1, corresponding to a π–π stacking distance of 3.53 Å. Thus, introduction of a siloxane-terminated side chain does not alter the interdigitation distance but can shorten the π–π stacking distance when compared with FBT-Th4(1,4). In a recent report, replacing alkyl with oligo(ethylene glycol) as side chains of conjugated polymers also showed a decreased π–π stacking distance from 4.4 to 4.1 Å.53 A shortened π–π stacking distance in a conjugated polymer can enhance interchain electron coupling. The crystal coherence lengths or crystal sizes of the (100) and (010) diffraction peaks were 17.1 nm and 3.9 nm, respectively. Thermal annealing at 100 °C led to a slight enhancement of the (100) crystal size to 20.3 nm and the π–π stacking crystal was increased to 4.12 nm. Further annealing at 200 °C generated a drastic change in crystal sizes. The (100) crystal size was increased to 27.7 nm and π–π stacking crystal size was increased to 5.20 nm. PFBT4T-C5Si-25% showed the same (100) and (010) diffraction positions as those of PFBT4T-C5Si-50%. The as-cast sample of PFBT4T-C5Si-25% showed a (100) crystal size of 17.3 nm and a π–π stacking crystal size of 4.29 nm. The 100 °C annealed film displayed a (100) crystal size of 13.5 nm and a π–π stacking crystal size of 4.19 nm and the 200 °C annealed film exhibited a (100) crystal size of 28.0 nm and a π–π stacking crystal size of 5.25 nm. It is seen that thermal annealing continuously increases crystallization of PFBT4T-C5Si-50% from low to high temperature, and PFBT4T-C5Si-25% samples showed crystallization size reduction under 100 °C and a sharp increase under 200 °C, thus there is an unusual phase transition around 100 °C to reduce the crystalline order. The unusual phase transition might be related to the competitive reorganization of interchain aggregation under the thermal annealing. The side-chain random copolymer PFBT4T-C5Si-25% has two kinds of repeating units on the main chain, and the ratio of siloxane-terminated side chain to the DT side chain is 1:3, probably leading to quite complicated packing driving forces of the repeating units. It should be noted that, from low to high temperature, the thermal annealing of the two polymers can result in gradual weakening of the IP (010) peak. Another obvious feature of the GIXD patterns is that PFBT4T-C5Si-50% always shows weaker IP (010) and OOP (100) diffractions when compared with PFBT4T-C5Si-25% samples, indicating that a higher content of siloxane-terminated side chains in a PFBT4T polymer is more favorable to suppress the edge-on orientation. On the other hand, under the same conditions, PFBT4T-C5Si-25% can always show a higher OFET mobility relative to PFBT4T-C5Si-50%, suggesting that the existing edge-on orientation also plays a role in hole transport along the lateral direction.

In the OFET channel, the high hole mobilities of PFBT4T-C5Si-50% and PFBT4T-C5Si-25% represent their transport abilities parallel to the substrate. For a polymer donor, its hole transport mode vertical to the substrate is more important for photovoltaic application. Thus, SCLC hole mobilities of PFBT4T-C5Si-50% and PFBT4T-C5Si-25% thick films (∼290 nm) were measured with hole-only device: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer/MoO3/Al (Fig. S7, ESI†). Both the polymer neat films exhibited high SCLC hole mobilities, with μh-SCLCs of 5.9 × 10−2 and 3.3 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PFBT4T-C5Si-50% and PFBT4T-C5Si-25%, respectively (Table 2). The results demonstrate the important role of face-on orientations on the vertical hole transports of the polymers. Thus, PFBT4T-C5Si-50% and PFBT4T-C5Si-25% are 3-D hole transporting materials. Such a 3-D transport is particularly beneficial for thick-film BHJ solar cells since IP and OOP diffused carriers can be effectively collected under applied bias. Indeed, in 380 nm thick polymer:PC71BM blend films, PFBT4T-C5Si-50% and PFBT4T-C5Si-25% showed excellent μh-SCLC values of 1.2 × 10−2 and 9.7 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (Fig. S8, ESI†). The SCLC electron mobilities (μe-SCLC) of the two blend films were obtained from electron-only devices with a configuration of Al/blend film/Ca/Al. The PFBT4T-C5Si-50% and PFBT4T-C5Si-25%-based devices showed comparable μe-SCLC values of 4.6 × 10−3 and 5.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The μh-SCLC/μe-SCLC ratios of PFBT4T-C5Si-50% and PFBT4T-C5Si-25%-based blend films were 2.6 and 1.9, respectively, indicating that the PFBT4T-C5Si-25%:PC71BM blend film could display more balanced hole and electron transports.
The high 3-D hole mobilities of PFBT4T-C5Si-50% and PFBT4T-C5Si-25% enable us to fabricate thick-film BHJ PSCs. An inverted device configuration of ITO/photo-conductive ZnO/polymer:PC71BM (1:1.5)/MoO3/Al was used. The photo-conductive ZnO cathode interlayer was prepared according a previous report,54 which is suitable for high-performance solar cells especially with a high current density by increasing the electron extraction efficiency for the increased electron conductivity and decreased work function under working conditions. The BHJ active layers were fabricated by spin-coating with hot solutions (90 °C), with the detailed conditions summarized in Table S1.† The measurements of the PSCs were carried out under AM1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2. The J–V characteristics of the PSCs are shown in Fig. 7, and their photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 3.

For the PFBT4T-C5Si-50%-based 270 nm thick active layer, the PSCs exhibited a Voc of 0.75 V, a Jsc of 16.98 mA cm−2, and a high FF of 70.98%, giving a good averaged PCE of 9.04% and the best PCE of 9.26%. Increasing the thickness to 390 nm almost did not alter the photovoltaic parameters and the PSCs maintained a PCE of 9.25%. A thicker active layer of 460 nm also afforded a high PCE of 9.02%. The results indicate that PFBT4T-C5Si-50%-based PSCs can show very small efficiency variations in the active layer thickness range between 270 and 460 nm.
Much better photovoltaic performances were achieved for PFBT4T-C5Si-25%-based thick-film PSCs, mainly contributed by improvements of Jsc and FF (Table 3 and Fig. 8a). When the active layer thickness was 150 nm, the PSCs showed an averaged PCE of 8.84% and the best PCE of 9.05%, based on an averaged Voc of 0.76 V, a Jsc of 15.58 mA cm−2, and a FF of 74.66%. A thicker active layer of 270 nm showed the best PCE to 10.39%, due to an enhanced Jsc of 17.92 mA cm−2. When the active layer thicknesses were further increased to 380 and 420 nm, the Jsc values could be elevated to 18.93 and 19.08 mA cm−2, respectively. The increasing of Jsc along with the active layer thickness can be ascribed to the more efficient utilization of incident light. The performance also implies that a fairly good BHJ film morphology can be well retained during the increasing of the film thickness. Delightedly, high FF values of more than 74% were maintained with an active layer thickness range from 150 to 420 nm. Thus, the PSCs could show remarkable PCEs of 10.95% and 11.09% for the 380 and 420 nm thick active layer devices. Further increasing the active layer thickness to 510 nm, the PSCs exhibited a Voc of 0.75 V, a Jsc of 18.72 mA cm−2, and a FF of 72.61%, affording the best PCE of 10.52%. With a thicker active layer of 600 nm, the PCE remained at 10.15%, due to a slight drop in the FF (71.47%). This is the first PCE more than 10% achieved by an active layer of a 600 nm thickness level in PSCs. Moreover, our results also offer a high thickness tolerance to achieve an unprecedented wide active layer processing window for PCE > 10%, supplying great potential for yield control in large-area and high-speed roll-to-roll application. In some sense, PFBT4T-C5Si-25% should probably be one of the most powerful polymer donors so far reported for BHJ PSCs with a fullerene acceptor. We also expect its good performance in a highly efficient thick-film PSC with a suitable nonfullerene acceptor. It should be noted that the FF of 71.47% achieved by the 600 nm thick active layer is uncommon. In previous reports for PSCs with ∼600 nm thick active layers, well-known poly(3-hexylthophene) (P3HT) and PDQT derived from diketopyrrolopyrrole and quarterthiophene only showed a FF of around 50%;55,56 the naphtha[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis[1,2,5]-thiadiazole-based polymer PBDT-DTNT displayed a FF of 62.9%.32 The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of PFBT4T-C5Si-25%-based PSCs of 150, 420, and 600 nm devices are shown in Fig. 8b, among which the 420 nm thick active layer displayed the highest response value. The integrated Jsc values with the EQE curves are 15.7, 18.9, and 18.3 mA cm−2, respectively, well corresponding to those in the J–V measurements of PSCs. Notably, the 420 nm thick active layer could show a flat EQE line in a big wavelength range from 380 to 720 nm.

The “optical interference effect” in a multilayer PSC structure can induce additional absorption loss for a certain active layer thickness, resulting in an oscillatory Jsc along with the increasing of the active layer thickness.57 In a recent report by Guo and coworkers, the most severe oscillatory effect on Jsc was found for a ∼125 nm thick active layer, but the effect was minimized by thicker active layers of 200 nm and beyond.58 For the investigated active layer thickness (150–600 nm) of PFB4T-C5Si-25% in our work, the thin 150 nm active layer-based PSC device may be affected by the “optical interference effect” and the lowest Jsc of 15.58 mA cm−2 was found for the device. A thicker active layer of 270 nm displayed a largely elevated Jsc of 17.92 mA cm−2. The maximum Jsc of 19.08 mA cm−2 was found for a 420 nm thick active layer. Then Jsc slightly decreased to 18.32 mA cm−2 for the 600 nm thick active layer. In some sense, our results are quite consistent with the experimental Jsc in the report by Guo and coworkers, which well support that hundreds of nanometers thick active layers can minimize the “optical interference effect” in multilayer PSC devices. Moreover, the most important fact is that PFB4T-C5Si-25% with very high 3D hole transports is effective to maintain a very high FF for the active layer thickness range from 270 to 600 nm so that PFB4T-C5Si-25%-based active layers can supply a large active layer processing window (∼200–600 nm) for PCE > 10%. Coincidently, the notable processing window based on the high mobility polymer keeps away from the most severe “optical interference effect” zone usually existing around the 125 nm thickness.57,58
In comparison to the case of PFBT4T-C5Si-50%, the aforementioned lower RMS roughness and more balanced hole and electron transports for the PFBT4T-C5Si-25%-based blend film all support its better photovoltaic performances. Furthermore, a BHJ morphology with the projection of bulk domain distribution from 3-D space to a 2-D map was provided by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 9, the TEM image of the PFBT4T-C5Si-50%-based BHJ film exhibits relatively larger phase separations when compared with PFBT4T-C5Si-25%. Many fine polymer fibrils can be found from the TEM image of the PFBT4T-C5Si-25%-based BHJ film, which affords a well-defined network of the donor and acceptor phases. This BHJ morphology is more beneficial for exciton splitting to achieve a high Jsc, confirming the photovoltaic performances of PFBT4T-C5Si-25% in PSCs.

To reveal structure orders in BHJ films of PFBT4T-C5Si-50% and PFBT4T-C5Si-25%, further GIXD characterization was carried out for some selected very thick BHJ samples. The GIXD patterns and line-cut profiles are shown in Fig. 10a and b, respectively. For all the samples, the strong diffractions at 1.32 Å−1 are from the PC71BM acceptor. For the two ∼400 nm thick BHJ films, the intense IP (100) and OOP (010) peaks plus the rather weak OOP (100) and IP (010) peaks indicate that the former mentioned face-on orientations for PFBT4T-C5Si-50% and PFBT4T-C5Si-25% can be well remained in the BHJ films, supporting the fast hole transports observed in SCLC measurements. The 600 nm thick PFBT4T-C5Si-25%-based BHJ film, also a BHJ active layer with the largest thickness for PSCs in this study, was also investigated. The diffraction pattern of the blend film shows a much wide distribution of the π–π stacking manner, resulting in slightly weakened IP (100) and OOP (010) peaks and obviously enhanced OOP (100) and (200) peaks. The behavior reflects that polymer crystallites will be less prone to be confined by the substrate surface during deposition of a very thick film of a 600 nm scale, leading to free dangling crystallites that can orient randomly. However, the film with a somewhat less ordered orientation is still quite efficient in PSC devices. This may be related to the 3-D hole transporting nature of the polymer. Charge carriers can hop through chains either in the IP or OOP direction under an applied electric field.
 Fig. 10  (a) Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) 2-D scattering images, (b) in-plane (dashed) and out-of-plane (solid) line-cut profiles, and (c) resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) of thick BHJ films of PFBT4T-C5Si-50% and PFBT4T-C5Si-25%. 
The length scale of phase separation of the selected BHJ films was investigated by resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) with the results shown in Fig. 10c, and very large length scales of phase separations were found. The PFBT4T-C5Si-50%-based 390 nm thick BHJ film showed a broad hump in the very low q region around 0.001–0.002 Å−1, giving a length scale of a phase separation of 300–600 nm. The PFBT4T-C5Si-25%-based 420 nm thick BHJ film showed a broad hump around 0.0025 Å−1, giving a distance of 250 nm. When compared with the Jsc of 17.02 mA cm−2 of the PFBT4T-C5Si-50%-based BHJ blend in PSCs, the obviously higher Jsc of 19.08 mA cm−2 for the PFBT4T-C5Si-25%-based BHJ blend suggests that too large phase separations would result in less efficient exciton splitting. The PFBT4T-C5Si-25%-based 600 nm thick BHJ film gave a scattering hump around 0.003 Å−1, corresponding to a phase separation of 210 nm. Generally, in the RSoXS observations, the scattering high q end of each sample decays quite slowly, which hid structure information. Thus, these BHJ films are of multi-length scaled morphologies. Based on the excellent Jsc of around 19 mA cm−2 and a FF more than 71% for the PFBT4T-C5Si-25%-based 420 and 600 nm thick BHJ films in PSCs, the observed phase separations may be a new type of efficient BHJ morphology. For this, a possible model for the large phase separations is tentatively proposed as: “highly face-on ordered PFBT4T-C5Si-25% chains stack vertically to form a “thin wall” donor phase with an unusual height, and the resulting acceptor phase vertically embeds between two adjacent donor walls” (see the illustration in Fig. S9, ESI†).
As a comparison, we also investigated the device performances of thick-film PSCs based on FBT-Th4(1,4) with 2-decyltetradecyl (DT) (Fig. 1a). The PSCs with 300, 400, and 500 nm active layers showed averaged PCEs of 10.62%, 9.89%, and 7.86%, respectively (Table S2 in the ESI†). Increasing thickness of the active layer from 400 to 500 nm, the largely decreased PCE is due to an obviously lower Jsc of 16.85 mA cm−2 and a FF of 61.46%. Thus, FBT-Th4(1,4) showing an edge-on orientation is not a suitable polymer donor to maintain high efficiency in PSCs with very thick active layers at a 500 nm level or beyond. Our results well demonstrate the important role of introducing a partial siloxane-terminated side chain in PFBT4T-C5Si-50% and PFBT4T-C5Si-25% towards maintaining high efficiencies in PSCs with largely varied active layer thicknesses.
Conclusions
In summary, a series of PFBT4T copolymers with siloxane-terminated side chains were synthesized, among which the side-chain random copolymer PFBT4T-C5Si-25% combining the 25% siloxane-terminated side chain and 75% DT side chain showed notable advantages in optoelectronic device applications. That the siloxane-terminated side chain induced face-on orientations of PFBT4T-C5Si-50% and PFBT4T-C5Si-25% were seen from their neat films and BHJ blend films, resulting in high 3-D hole transports in neat films and fast SCLC hole and electron transports in BHJ blend films. Thus, all the PSC devices with different active layer thicknesses investigated in this study showed a high FF more than 70%. In comparison to the case of PFBT4T-C5Si-50%, lower film surface roughness, more balanced hole and electron transport, and relatively smaller phase separation were found for the PFBT4T-C5Si-25%-based BHJ blend film, causing an obviously higher Jsc and FF in PSCs. Delightedly, PFBT4T-C5Si-25%-based PSCs with 270, 420, and 600 nm thick active layers exhibited outstanding PCEs of 10.39%, 11.09%, and 10.15%, respectively, readily offering a high thickness tolerance to achieve an unprecedented wide active layer processing window for PCE > 10%. This is also the first PCE more than 10% achieved by an active layer of a 600 nm thickness level in PSCs. The results suggest that the side-chain engineering through the incorporation of a partial siloxane-terminated side chain is a unique handle to afford new photovoltaic polymers with enhanced vertical carrier transport towards the application in roll-to-roll processing of PSCs.
