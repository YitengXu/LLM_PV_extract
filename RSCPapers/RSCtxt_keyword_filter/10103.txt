    , Accepted 25th August 2022First published on 25th August 2022AbstractRobust mechanical properties and high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) are both the prerequisites for their application in wearable and stretchable electronics. However, these properties typically encounter a trade-off relationship. Herein, we report the development of new polymerized small-molecule acceptors (PSMAs) containing siloxane (SiO)-based flexible spacers (FSs) and demonstrate high-performance and mechanically robust all-PSCs. The introduction of highly flexible SiO-FSs increases the mechanical ductility of all-PSCs. Importantly, the SiO-FS unit enhances the solubility of PSMAs, enabling the fabrication of high-performance all-PSCs by solution processing using a non-halogenated solvent. Therefore, a high PCE (13.5%) and crack-onset strain (COS = 15.2%) are achieved for the all-PSC based on a SiO-FS-containing PSMA (PYSiO-10), which are superior to those of the reference system without SiO-FS (PCE = 9.8% and COS = 9.6%).
Introduction
Development of efficient and stretchable polymer solar cells is essential for their possible application as wearable power sources.1–5 All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) composed of a polymer donor (PD) and polymer acceptor (PA) are considered promising due to their excellent mechanical robustness and thermal/morphological stabilities.6–27 Recently, the advent of polymerized small-molecule-acceptors (PSMAs) has dramatically increased the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all-PSCs owing to their strong light absorption and efficient charge transport.28–30 The structures of PSMAs, including the backbone, side-chain, regioregularity, and molecular weight, have been later engineered to enhance the PCE of all-PSCs to ∼18%.31–41
In PSMAs, highly fused ladder-type backbones are important to ensure high charge mobility and sufficient sunlight harvesting.29,42,43 However, the presence of excessively rigid backbones compromises mechanical properties and solubilities.44–47 As a result, pristine PSMA films are mechanically fragile, limiting the overall mechanical properties of all-PSCs. In addition, most of the efficient all-PSCs have been produced by solution processing with halogenated solvents (i.e., chloroform or chlorobenzene) due to the limited solubilities of PSMAs in other solvents.6,8 These harmful solvents are not compatible and sustainable with industrial production. In addition, the low solubilities and strong pre-aggregation of PSMAs cause rapid precipitation during solution processing, resulting in the formation of a strongly phase-segregated blend morphology with large aggregates.48,49 The weak domain–domain interfaces in the blend provide pathways for crack-propagation under mechanical stress, which makes the resulting blend films fragile.
To address the abovementioned challenge, different research groups have introduced flexible-spacer (FS) units into PSMA skeletons.10,48,50,51 In these studies, FS units in the conjugated backbones effectively alleviated excessive rigidities of the polymer chains and also induced a favorable blend morphology with well-developed intermixed domains, thereby increasing the mechanical ductility of the resulting blend films. Nevertheless, alkyl-containing spacers have been mainly developed for FS units, which have limitations in maximizing the flexibility and solubility of PSMAs. This is because the alkyl chains must have a relatively long critical length (i.e., hexyl–octyl) to be flexible due to a considerably high rotational energy of over 10 kJ mol−1.52,53
Siloxane (SiO) is an effective functional group for enhancing the molecular flexibility and solubility of polymers. For example, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is a well-known rubbery polymer having low glass transition temperature (Tg, from −130 to −120 °C) and high elasticity with a yield point at over 100% strain.54–57 The significantly lower rotational energy (∼3.8 kJ mol−1) of silicon and oxygen bonds in SiO units compared with the CH2–CH2 bonds (rotational energy: ∼12.1 kJ mol−1) facilitates free rotation of polymer chains.58–60 Moreover, the distance between adjacent chains is larger in SiOs than in alkanes, which also contributes to the greater flexibility of SiO-FSs. Furthermore, the large free volumes of SiO units ensure high solubility of the resulting polymers in most organic solvents. Therefore, a new design of polymers containing SiO-based FS (SiO-FS) units is versatile to improve the chain flexibility and solubility of PSMAs. To the best of our knowledge, this molecular design has not been employed in conjugated polymers for organic photovoltaics.
Herein, we develop a new series of PSMAs (PYSiO-X, X = 0, 5, 10, 20, and 30) by interposing SiO-FS units into the PSMA backbone, achieving mechanically robust and non-halogenated-solvent processable all-PSCs. The optimal content of SiO-FS in PSMAs (5–10 mol%) significantly enhances their chain flexibility and solubility, while maintaining the crystalline and electrical properties. Thus, the PCE and mechanical stretchability of the all-PSCs based on a PSMA with 10 mol% SiO-FS are simultaneously increased (PCE = 13.5% and crack-onset strain (COS) = 15.2%) compared to those of the reference system based on a PSMA without SiO-FS (PCE = 9.8% and COS = 9.6%). Importantly, the enhanced PSMA solubility enables the fabrication of all-PSCs by processing with a non-halogenated-solvent (ortho-xylene (o-XY)).
Results and discussion
Synthesis and basic material properties
We designed new PSMAs with SiO-containing FS units in order to tune the solubility and flexibility of the PSMA chains. Specifically, the SiO-FS units have significantly lower rotational energy and larger free volume than alkyl chain-based units, enhancing the impact of the FS unit on the flexibility of the PSMA chains. In this study, we used a benzodithiophene (BDT)-based PSMA as the reference PA, which is expected to have a good molecular compatibility with poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PBDB-T) PD. Then, the SiO-FS unit was incorporated into a PSMA backbone by replacing the rigid Y-accepting moiety in order to alleviate the backbone rigidities and increase the solubilities of the PSMAs. Thus, a series of PSMAs (PYSiO-X, X = 0, 5, 10, 20, and 30) with gradually increased content of the SiO-FS were synthesized by Stille coupling polymerization (Scheme S1†). The “X” denotes the molar ratio of SiO-FS compared with the total accepting moieties (SiO-FS + Y5). The detailed synthetic procedures are provided in the ESI.† The chemical structures of the SiO-FS unit and resulting PSMAs were confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra (Fig. S1–S4†). In particular, the intensities of the peaks in the range of 0.0–1.0 ppm, which correspond to the signals of SiO-FS, are linearly strengthened by increasing the SiO-FS content in PSMAs, (Fig. S4†). The number-average molecular weights (Mns) of the PSMAs were within a similar range of 16–22 kg mol−1, minimizing the effects of molecular weights on polymer properties.
First, the optical and electrochemical properties of the synthesized PSMAs were characterized. The absorption coefficients at the respective maximum absorption wavelength (εmaxs) of each PSMA were estimated from ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra in both solution and film states (Fig. S5† and Table 1). The film UV-Vis absorption of PBDB-T is displayed in Fig. S5c.† All the PSMAs showed absorption ranges that are complementary to the PBDB-T absorption, affording efficient charge generation in wide wavelength ranges. The εmaxs of PSMAs in both solutions and films linearly decreased with increasing SiO-FS contents. For instance, the εfilmmax values of PYSiO-0, PYSiO-10, and PYSiO-30 were 1.25, 1.16, and 0.85 × 105 cm−1, respectively. This is attributed to the replacement of the dye unit based on the Y5 backbone by the SiO-FS unit. Also, the maximum absorption wavelengths (λmaxs) of PSMAs decreased with higher SiO-FS contents in both solution and films. For instance, the λfilmmax values of the PYSiO-0, PYSiO-10, and PYSiO-30 were 786, 783, and 780 nm, respectively (Fig. 1c and Table 1). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements (Fig. S6, S7, and Table S1†). All of the PSMAs showed well-aligned energy levels with PBDB-T, showing sufficient driving forces (>0.3 eV) for exciton dissociation. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the PSMAs gradually increased with increasing SiO-FS contents, due to the strong electron-donating property of SiO-FS.

To examine the crystalline and electrical properties of polymers, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIXS), and space-charge limited current (SCLC) mobility measurements were carried out (Table 1). First, the thermal properties of the PSMAs in bulk states were analyzed by DSC. The 2nd heating/cooling cycles of the PSMAs were used in the DSC analysis to remove their thermal history. The heating and cooling thermograms are displayed in Fig. 1c and S8,† respectively. In the heating cycles, increasing the SiO-FS content in the PSMA decreased melting temperature (Tm) and melting enthalpy (ΔHm) values. For example, the Tm values of PYSiO-0, PYSiO-10, and PYSiO-30 were 305, 291, and 273 °C, respectively. Also, the ΔHm of PYSiO-0, PYSiO-10, and PYSiO-30 was 18.4, 16.1, and 9.0 J g−1, respectively. The crystallization temperature (Tc) and crystallization enthalpy (ΔHc) showed similar trends (Fig. S8 and Table S2†). The decreased crystallinity of the PSMA with higher SiO-FS content indicates enhanced chain flexibility.
Subsequently, GIXS profiles were analyzed to investigate the crystalline structures of PSMAs in thin-film states. The 2D images and linecut profiles of the pristine films are presented in Fig. S9 and S10,† respectively. In the GIXS profiles, all the polymers showed a face-on preferential packing orientation with clear (100) peaks in the in-plane (IP) direction and (010) peaks in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction.61,62 Among the peaks, the OOP (010) peaks (qz ∼ 1.6 Å−1) of PSMAs associated with π–π stacking were evaluated to compare their crystallinity (Fig. S11†). The coherence length (Lc) values of the OOP (010) peaks were estimated using the Scherrer equation for quantitative analysis.63,64 Interestingly, the trend of crystallinity in thin-film states is different from that in bulk states as measured from DSC. The Lc values of the PSMAs increased with SiO-FS incorporation, and showed a maximum value for the PYSiO-10. Then, the Lc decreased with further incorporation of SiO-FS in PSMAs. For instance, the LOOPc (010) values of PYSiO-0, PYSiO-10, and PYSiO-30 were 2.0, 2.3, and 1.7 nm, respectively. Relative degree of crystallinity (r-DoC) values were estimated from the (010) peaks of the PSMAs (q ranges between 1.4 and 1.7 Å−1) based on the literature method.65 The trend of r-DoC exhibited the same trend of the Lc values (Fig. S12 and Table S3†). For example, r-DOCs of the PYSiO-0, PYSiO-10, and PYSiO-30 were 0.94, 1.00, and 0.66, respectively. This suggests that the appropriate incorporation (5–10 mol%) of SiO-FS improves the crystallinity of PSMA in thin films, while a higher content of SiO-FS (20–30 mol%) hinders the formation of the polymer assembly in the film. We speculate that the increased Lc values with 5–10 mol% of SiO-FS incorporation are partly associated with the increased PSMA solubility, which allows sufficient time for effective crystallization of PSMAs during the thin film formation.48,66 The SCLC electron mobilities (μes) of pristine PSMAs followed the trend of Lc values, showing a maximum value for the PYSiO-10 film (Fig. S11†). The μe values of PYSiO-0, PYSiO-10, and PYSiO-30 were 3.1 × 10−4, 4.8 × 10−4, and 5.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (Table 1). Therefore, the incorporation of 5–10 mol% SiO-FS is optimal for not only increasing the backbone flexibility of PSMAs, but also inducing superior crystalline/electrical properties in thin films.
Photovoltaic properties
Next, the photovoltaic properties of PBDB-T:PYSiO-X blends were investigated by fabricating all-PSCs with a normal-type device architecture (Fig. 2a and Table 2). The detailed procedures for all-PSC fabrication and measurement are described in the Experimental Section.† The active layers of all-PSCs were processed with a non-halogenated solvent, o-XY. The reference PYSiO-0 blend showed a PCE of 9.83%, with open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) values of 0.91 V, 18.74 mA cm−2, and 0.58, respectively. The incorporation of SiO-FS units into PSMAs increased the PCEs of the resulting all-PSCs. For instance, the PCEs of the blends containing modified PSMAs and PBDB-T were 11.40 (PYSiO-5), 13.52 (PYSiO-10), 11.94 (PYSiO-20), and 10.74% (PYSiO-30). Therefore, the PCE enhancements were maximized for the all-PSCs with PYSiO-10 PSMA, which was mainly attributed to the high Jsc and FF values of 21.62 mA cm−2 and 0.67. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of all-PSCs are displayed in Fig. 2b, and the calculated Jsc values obtained from EQE spectra are presented in Table 2. The calculated values of Jscs were well-matched with the device Jsc values. The blends with SiO-FS incorporated PSMAs showed higher EQE intensities in both PD (400–650 nm) and PSMA absorption (650–900 nm) regimes, suggesting that the current generation from both PD and PSMAs was improved.

To investigate the origins of the abovementioned photovoltaic trend, the charge generation, transport, and recombination properties of all-PSCs were measured. First, the charge generation properties of all-PSCs were investigated by examining photocurrent densities (Jphs) under effective voltages (Veffs) (Fig. 2c and Table 3).67 The exciton dissociation probability (P(E,T)) values of the blends were calculated by dividing Jsc values by saturated current densities (Jsat, at Veff = 6 V). The P(E,T) values of PYSiO-0, PYSiO-10, and PYSiO-30 blends were 75.2, 80.5, and 83.4%, respectively. This result suggests that the increasing content of SiO-FS in PSMAs facilitates exciton dissociation and charge generation at the PD–PSMA interfaces.

The charge transport abilities of the blends were explored by measuring their SCLC charge mobilities (Table 3). The hole mobility (μh) values of the blends were almost constant in a range of 3.7–4.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 regardless of the SiO-FS contents in PSMAs. In contrast, a non-linear trend of the blend μes depending on PSMAs was observed, showing a maximum value of 3.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the PYSiO-10 blend. In contrast, the μe of the PYSiO-0 blend was 1.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. As a result, the μh/μe value (0.9) was optimized in the PYSiO-10 blend, agreeing well with the highest Jsc and FF values of all-PSC based on the PYSiO-10 blend.
In series, the charge recombination properties of the blends were evaluated by measuring light-intensity (P) dependent Jsc and Voc of all-PSCs (Fig. 2d and S13†). The Jsc has a power-law relationship with P (Jsc ∝ Pα).68,69 In the P vs. Jsc plots, the slope α value of the PYSiO-0 blend was 0.81, which increased to 0.84 for the PYSiO-10 blend, but decreased back to 0.80 for the PYSiO-30 blend. This indicates that the bimolecular recombination is most suppressed in the PYSiO-10 blend. The Voc is proportional to the natural logarithm of P, with the unit of kT per q (k = Boltzmann constant, T = temperature and q = elementary charge).68 In the P vs. Voc graph, the PYSiO-0 blend showed a slope (S) value of 1.35 kT per q (Fig. 2d). The S value decreased to 1.20 kT per q for the PYSiO-10 blend, and increased back to 1.34 kT per q for the PYSiO-30 blend. Thus, the monomolecular/trap-assisted recombination is most effectively reduced in the PYSiO-10 blend. The charge recombination properties of the blends are correlated with the high photovoltaic properties (i.e., Jsc and FF values) of the PYSiO-10-based all-PSCs.
Mechanical properties
Additionally, the mechanical properties of the blend films were investigated by a pseudo free-standing tensile test (Fig. 3 and Table 4). This testing method enables us to obtain the intrinsic tensile properties of thin films, excluding effects from thick substrates.70–72 All blend films for the tensile testing were prepared under the same conditions as those of device fabrication. The PYSiO-0 blend showed COS and toughness values of 9.6% and 3.2 MJ m−3, respectively. Importantly, the incorporation of SiO-FS in PSMAs increased both COS and toughness values of the blends, and the increases were proportional to the SiO-FS contents. For instance, the COS values of PYSiO-5, PYSiO-10, PYSiO-20, and PYSiO-30 blends were 13.9, 15.2, 17.6, and 19.5%, respectively. Moreover, the corresponding toughness values of PYSiO-5, PYSiO-10, PYSiO-20, and PYSiO-30 blends were 4.9, 5.2, 6.6, and 7.3 MJ m−3. The film images during the tensile test are displayed in Fig. 3c. The PYSiO-0 blend showed complete fracture by 10% strain, whereas the PYSiO-10 blend did not undergo crack formation. Thus, the interposition of SiO-FS in PSMA backbones is effective in increasing the mechanical robustness of the resulting blend films. The PYSiO-10 blend achieved both a high PCE (13.5%) and stretchability (COS = 15.2%), simultaneously (Fig. S14 and Table S4†). It is notable that these high performances of the PYSiO-10-based all-PSCs were achieved by a halogen-free solvent processing.

For direct observation of different stretchabilities with the incorporation of SiO-FS, the optical microscopy (OM) images of the blend films on the elastomer substrates (thermoplastic urethane, TPU) were recorded during elongation (Fig. 3d). The PYSiO-0 blend showed crack formation after 20% strain, and more and larger cracks were generated after 40% strain. In contrast, the PYSiO-10 blend maintained initial morphology up to 20% strain without any cracks, and only small and a few cracks were formed above 30% strain. This result supports the increased stretchability of the blend films with SiO-FS incorporation in PSMAs.
Next, we compared the photovoltaic and mechanical properties of flexible all-PSCs with two different blends (PBDB-T:PYSiO-0 and PBDB-T:PYSiO-10) (Fig. S15–S16 and Table S5†). The device architecture and photograph of flexible all-PSCs are shown in Fig. S14.† The J–V curves and PCE plots depending on the bending cycles (bending diameter = 10 mm) of flexible all-PSCs are exhibited in Fig. S16.† The photovoltaic performances of flexible devices followed those of the rigid all-PSCs. For example, the PCE values of the PBDB-T:PYSiO-0 and PBDB-T:PYSiO-10-based all-PSCs were 8.75 and 10.03%, respectively (Table S5 and Fig. S16a†). Notably, flexible all-PSCs showed different mechanical durabilities against repetitive bending (Fig. S16b†). The PCE of the PYSiO-0 blend decreased to 80% of the initial PCE after 250 bending cycles, whereas the PYSiO-10 blend retained approximately 90% of the initial PCE after the same bending cycles.

To gain a better understanding of the different photovoltaic and mechanical properties of the blends, their morphological properties were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM), resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS), GIXS, and in situ UV-Vis measurements (Fig. 4 and S17–S19†). First, the surface morphologies of the blends were compared in the AFM height images (Fig. 4a). The PYSiO-0 blend showed a rough surface and highly phase-separated morphology, but the extents of phase separation gradually reduced with increasing SiO-FS contents. The root-mean-square averaged roughness (Rq) values of PYSiO-0, PYSiO-10, and PYSiO-30 blends were 2.8, 1.1, and 0.6 nm, respectively (Table 5).

The RSoXS measurement was employed to probe the blend morphologies in terms of domain size/purity (Fig. 4b). The beam energy of 284.2 eV was selected to maximize material contrast in the blends.73,74 The PYSiO-0 blend showed a scattering peak at q ∼ 0.01 Å−1, which corresponds to the characteristic domain spacing of 62.2 nm. In contrast, the blends with SiO-FS-incorporated PSMAs showed smaller domain spacing values between 38.3 and 49.5 nm. Importantly, the scattering intensities in the RSoXS profiles gradually decreased for the higher SiO-FS contents. For a quantitative analysis, relative domain purities, which are proportional to the square-root of integrated scattering intensities, were estimated following the previous literature.75–77 The relative domain purities of PYSiO-0, PYSiO-10, and PYSiO-30 blends were 1.00, 0.66, and 0.61, respectively. This result suggests that higher SiO-FS contents in the PSMAs suppress excessive phase separation in the blends and promote the formation of the intermixed domains between the PD and PSMA.
The crystalline properties of the blend films were investigated by GIXS measurements (Fig. 4c, S17, S18,† and Table 5). All the blends showed OOP π–π stacking peaks in a similar d-spacing range of 3.94–3.96 Å, but their crystal sizes were different depending on the PSMAs. For example, the Lc values of PYSiO-0, PYSiO-10, and PYSiO-30 blends were 1.90, 2.10, and 1.82 nm, respectively. This Lc trend in the blends is consistent with that of the pristine PSMA films, suggesting that the crystalline structures of PSMAs are well maintained in the blends.
To monitor the film forming process of the blends depending on SiO-FS contents, in situ UV-Vis profiles of three different blends (based on PYSiO-0, PYSiO-10, and PYSiO-30) were measured (Fig. 4e, f, and S19†).78,79 The absorptions in the wavelength ranges of 200–1100 nm were tracked during the spin-coating process. The corresponding 2D-images are shown in Fig. S19.† In particular, the intensity profiles at 615 and 750 nm, corresponding to the absorption of PD and PSMA, respectively, are plotted as a function of time after initiating spin-coating (Fig. 4e and f). The saturation time (tsat) of the absorption intensities in both PD- and PSMA-absorption regimes varied depending on PSMAs. The tsat values for PYSiO-0, PYSiO-10, and PYSiO-30 blends were 1.9, 2.1, and 2.7 s, respectively, indicating that the PSMA with higher SiO-FS content increased the time for the film formation in the blend (Fig. 4d and e). We speculate that this is due to the increased solubility of the PSMA with higher SiO-FS content. In contrast, the low solubility of PYSiO-0 resulted in fast precipitation of strongly aggregated PSMA chains during the film formation, generating a relatively rough and phase-separated morphology in the blend film compared to those of the blend films with SiO-FS incorporated PSMAs.
Overall, the incorporation of an appropriate content of SiO-FS units into the PSMAs effectively enhances their chain flexibility and solubility without compromising their crystalline and electrical properties. The enhanced solubility of the PSMAs with the optimal SiO-FS contents (5–10 mol%) prevents excessive PSMA aggregation in solution. In addition, this sufficient solubility allows sufficient tsat before the morphology quenching, affording the blend morphology with well-developed intermixed domains. Therefore, these improved blend morphologies of the PYSiO-5 and PYSiO-10 PSMAs together with their enhanced chain flexibilities increase the mechanical robustness and the charge generation/transport properties of the all-PSC devices.
Conclusions
In this work, we developed a series of PSMAs containing SiO-FS and achieved efficient and mechanically robust all-PSCs processed with a non-halogenated solvent. Incorporation of the SiO-FS units (5–10 mol%) into the PSMAs effectively increased their backbone flexibility and solubility without compromising their crystalline and electrical properties. As a result, the optimal PCE (13.5%) and mechanical robustness (COS = 15.2%) of all-PSCs were achieved in the PBDB-T:PYSiO-10 blend, which were higher than those of all-PSCs based on the reference PBDB-T:PYSiO-0 blend (PCE = 9.8% and COS = 9.6%). The morphological analyses including AFM, GIXS, RSoXS, and in situ UV-Vis absorption measurements revealed that the PSMAs featuring SiO-FS induce more favorable intermixing with the PBDB-T PD compared to the PSMA without SiO-FS. The enlarged PD–PSMA interfaces provided pathways for mechanical stress dissipation and charge generation, enabling simultaneous enhancements in the photovoltaic and mechanical properties. This work suggests effective molecular design of PSMAs for producing all-PSCs with high PCEs and mechanical robustness at the same time.
