    , Accepted 3rd July 2014First published on 4th July 2014AbstractWide-bandgap semiconductors are potential materials for photovoltaic (PV) devices in solution-based applications because of their higher stability compared with narrow-bandgap semiconductors. However, these materials are poor absorbers of photons in the solar spectrum and yield modest conversion efficiencies. Here we show how this problem can be solved by the growth and control of pseudomorphic crystals in type-II wide-bandgap ZnO/ZnSe coaxial nanowires. Light absorption of coaxial nanowires under critical strains significantly extended beyond the near-infrared region to cover up to 94% of the solar power. The photocurrent response of the nanowire solar cell was markedly enhanced in visible and infrared regions with a threshold of approximately 0.9 eV, accounting for more than 35% of the conversion efficiency. This work paves the way for stable and efficient PV devices based on wide-bandgap semiconductors.
1. Introduction
Solar cells significantly contribute to addressing the global energy issues and the growing environmental pollution.1,2 These electrical devices traditionally work based on the principle of the p–n junction formed by joining p- and n-type semiconductors.3 Only the incident photons with energies greater than the bandgap are absorbed by the semiconductors to generate electron–hole pairs, which are consequently separated by the built-in electric field in the depletion region and form photocurrents.4 The broad solar spectrum reveals that more than 90% of energy is located from the ultraviolet (UV) to the near-infrared (NIR) regions (threshold, 0.9 eV), as shown in Fig. 1a. Therefore, narrow-bandgap semiconductors, such as Si,5–7 CdTe,8,9 GaAs,10,11 and CIGS,12 are commonly used in photovoltaic (PV) applications. To date, the Si cell, the most popular solar cell, has a maximum efficiency of 24.7%.13 Although substantial advances have enhanced the efficiency of solar cells, the cost of power generation for these devices remains higher than those of conventional resources, such as coal, gas, and oil.

The solid lines show the natural band alignments, and the dashed lines show the strained ones. The red arrow indicates the effective bandgap caused by the transition from the valence band maximum of ZnSe to the conduction band minimum of ZnO. 
Nanostructures have been intensively investigated for next-generation PV architectures to lower generation costs and improve efficiency.14,15 Compared with conventional film structures, nanowire arrays (NWAs) have larger surface-area-to-volume ratios, lower light reflectivity, and more effective absorption behavior because of light trapping.16,17 They are favorable for the improvement of device efficiency. At present, ZnO NWAs have been widely applied to these devices because of their mature fabrication techniques, stability, non-toxicity, and abundance that result in low generation costs.18,19 Pure ZnO has a wide bandgap of about 3.2 eV and uses UV light that merely accounts for approximately 7% of the solar spectrum (Fig. 1a). The effective use of solar energy requires semiconductors with a narrower bandgap, such as ZnSe,20,21 CdS,22 CdSe,23 and CdTe;24 these materials are usually coupled with ZnO nanowires to form type-II band structures for PV or photoelectrochemical (PEC) applications. What differentiates the type-II heterojunction cell (“sensitized cell”) from p–n junction cells is the spatial separation of electron–hole pairs by the interfacial energy gradient.25 This separation requires the sensitized semiconductors to have a bandgap wide enough to form type-II band alignments with ZnO materials. Among them, wider bandgap semiconductors are favorable to high open-circuit voltages. They also have better anti-photoreactive and anti-corrosive properties in PEC cells with a liquid electrolyte composed of the iodide/tri-iodide (I−/I3−) or sulfide/polysulfide (S2−/Sn2−) redox couple. Recently, the reduction of the effective bandgap (EBG) in type-II wide-bandgap heterojunctions through interfacial transitions has been studied to absorb sunlight more efficiently.26,27 The theoretical EBG is 2.07 eV for ZnO/ZnS (ZnS, 3.70 eV)26 and 1.84 eV for ZnO/ZnSe (ZnSe, 2.70 eV).20 The previous predictions were attained in our recent work, in which type-II interfacial transitions had a threshold of 1.6 eV in ZnO/ZnSe coaxial nanowires.21 In principle, the conversion efficiency is restrained by the bandgap and the number of layers in solar cells.4 To further enhance the efficiency, the interfacial energy gradient should be extended beyond the NIR region to cover the entire solar spectrum. Moreover, the bandgap of the core and shell layer should be reduced to effectively absorb visible light.
Common attempts to lower the bandgap include doping modification and the strain-induced method.28–31 The material quality of the solar cell has a significant impact on efficiency. For doping methods, the introduction of defects and the formation of recombination centers are easy, especially in heterointerfaces, and result in lower efficiencies. Although strain-induced bandgap engineering has been reported, much effort has been focused on components with low lattice mismatch, such as CdSe/CdTe quantum dots.30 The adjustment range of the bandgap is small because of low strain. Highly mismatched heterostructures yield large bandgap variations in pseudomorphic layers and interfacial energy gradient from their large strains. To date, overcoming the problem of high-quality growth of thick pseudomorphic layers as well as bandgap modification in large mismatch coaxial nanowires for the effective use of sunlight is a challenge.
Here, we report a type-II ZnO/ZnSe coaxial nanowire solar cell with a response threshold of 0.9 eV that covers more than 94% of the solar spectrum. To the best of our knowledge, the response threshold is the lowest one reported in the literature. The lattice spacing near the interface is tuned over a wide range by the growth of pseudomorphic layers and the control of the stress in the core and the shell. This procedure yields great changes in the energy band structure in the pseudomorphic layers (ZnO core and ZnSe shell) and the EBG at the interface, as shown in Fig. 1b. An EBG of 0.3 eV is expected for thin coaxial nanowires under critical strains.
2. Experimental section
Nanowire growth
ZnO/ZnSe coaxial NWAs were grown by a two-step chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. The CVD system contained a horizontal quartz tube furnace with three heating zones. The vertical, well-aligned ZnO NWAs were initially synthesized on an AZO substrate (area, 1 cm × 1 cm). High purity metallic Zn powder (5 N, 1.0 g) was used as the source material and placed at the central heating zone. The substrate was placed downstream of the Zn source (distance, 8 cm). Prior to heating, the system was evacuated to a pressure of 1.0 × 10−2 Pa; an N2 flow of 100 sccm was introduced into the tube. Then, the tube was heated to 580 °C at a rate of 20 °C min−1. When the temperature reached 580 °C, O2 (flow rate, 8 sccm) was passed into the tube. The reaction was maintained for 30 min. To grow the ZnSe shell, high-purity Se powder (5 N, 0.2 g) and Zn powder (5 N, 0.5 g) were placed at the first and third heating zones with a growth temperature of 480 °C. ZnSe shells with thicknesses of about 5, 10, 20, and 50 nm were grown by controlling the growth time and labeled as S5 nm, S10 nm, S20 nm, and S50 nm, respectively.
Device assembly
In the PV application, the as-prepared NWAs were used as the working electrodes. The counter electrode was prepared by coating FTO glass with a thin layer of 8 mM H2PtCl4 ethanol solution, followed by heating at 400 °C for 20 min. The two electrodes were sealed together with a 60 μm thick polymer film (Surlyn, DuPont). The internal space of the cell was filled with a typical electrolyte (0.1 M LiI, 0.01 M I2, 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) and 0.6 M butyl methyl imidazolium iodide (BMII)). The active area of the solar cell was about 0.49 cm2.
Physical characterization
The morphologies of the as-grown ZnO and ZnO/ZnSe NWAs were characterized using a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) (LEO 1530, 20 kV). The structures and compositions were analyzed through X-ray diffraction (XRD) (X'Pert PRO) using the grazing angle (5°) mode and transmission electron microscope (TEM) (Tecnai F30, 300 kV). The transmission spectra were recorded using a Varian Cary 5000 UV-vis NIR spectrophotometer.
Solar cell characterization
Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cells were measured under AM1.5 solar illumination (100 mW cm−2) with a Zolix Class AAA solar simulator. The intensity of the solar simulator was calibrated with a standard silicon cell tested and certified by the state metrological bureau. An Agilent B2912A was used as the ammeter in the J–V measurement. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured on a broadband spectroscopy system composed of a grating monochromator (Acton Research Corporation, SpectraPro-750i), a 100 W bromine–tungsten lamp, and a locked-in amplifier (Stanford Research Systems, SR830 DSP) in comparison with reference Si and Ge cells.
Theoretical simulations
The strained structures of ZnO/ZnSe coaxial nanowires were calculated by the mechanic equilibrium method.32 The coherent thickness of the ZnSe pseudomorphic layer was determined not only by the formation of misfit dislocations but also by crystalline phase transition. The bandgap of strained ZnO and the EBG of coaxial nanowires were calculated by the first principles calculation (Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package).33 The electron–ion interactions were described by the projector augmented wave method with generalized gradient approximation correction. The electronic wave functions were expanded using a plane-wave basis set (cutoff, 500 eV). The Brillouin zone integrations were performed for 9 × 9 × 3 Monkhorst-Pack grids. Zn-3d electrons were used as the valence electrons. The calculated bandgaps of the strained ZnO were corrected by a scissor operator.
3. Results and discussion
Design of pseudomorphic layers in ZnO/ZnSe coaxial nanowires
Compared with the traditional film structure, the coaxial structure can accommodate a large lattice misfit strain through elastic deformation and keep a thick pseudomorphic layer near the interface. This configuration enables the coaxial nanowire to have a large tuning range in electronic structures. On the basis of this idea, we calculated the strain and electronic structures for ZnO/ZnSe coaxial nanowires. Fig. 2a shows the dependence of critical thickness of pseudomorphic layers on the ZnO core diameter. A thick coherent layer (thickness, >2 nm) preferentially forms over a wide range of the ZnO diameter at the interface and creates a favorable condition for interfacial transitions. In contrast to common reports with an exponential increase in critical thickness with decreased diameter of the nanowire core,32 a maximum critical value of 6.5 nm was obtained at the ZnO core (diameter, 9 nm). This anomalous phenomenon is attributed to the accommodation of most mismatch stress in the ZnO core instead of in the ZnSe shell for a thin core diameter. In this case, the mismatch stress in the ZnSe shell was unable to maintain the stability and coherence of wurtzite (WZ) ZnSe, and it resulted in phase transition or defect formation. This result suggested that the strains and electronic structures in the ZnO core could also be modified by the thicknesses of the core and the shell. Fig. 2b shows the interfacial lattice constants in the c-axis for ZnO/ZnSe coaxial nanowires with different thickness ratios. The value could almost vary from that of ZnO (0.52 nm) to that of ZnSe (0.66 nm) under different thickness ratios. The large tensile strain resulted in the large bandgap variation of the ZnO core from the UV region to the visible region (2.5 eV), as shown in Fig. 2c. This variation greatly enhanced sunlight absorption. Meanwhile, EBG was correspondingly tuned from visible to short wavelength infrared range (<0.9 eV), as shown in Fig. 2d. A minimum EBG of approximately 0.3 eV was obtained for coaxial nanowires under critical strain with the approximate lattice constant of bulk ZnSe.

Realization of bandgap modification
In our experiment, we realized the growth of thick pseudomorphic layers and the strain modification in ZnO/ZnSe coaxial nanowires by varying the ZnO diameter and the ZnSe thickness by a two-step CVD method. It is known that interfacial transitions rely on the interfacial quality; low qualities result in the recombination of photo-induced carriers at the interface. However, a large lattice mismatch and different stable phase structures yield considerably high requirements for coherent interface growth. To overcome these difficulties, we optimized the growth conditions of ZnO nanowires and ZnSe shells. The results showed that the smooth lateral surfaces and uniform diameter along the entire length for ZnO nanowires are important in the formation of coherent interfaces. The ZnO core diameter and the ZnSe shell thickness are responsible for the thickness of the pseudomorphic layer. Fig. 3a–d show the SEM images of the well-aligned ZnO nanowires and the ZnO/ZnSe coaxial nanowires with different ZnSe thicknesses. The nanowires in Fig. 3b–d exhibit rougher surfaces, indicating the formation of a coaxial structure. When the shell layer is thin, only part of the ZnO core is coated (inset in Fig. 3b). With the increase of the shell layer, the ZnO nanowires were fully sheathed by the ZnSe shell along the entire length, and finally inverted cone-shaped coaxial nanowires were formed until the top of holes between nanowires were filled up (Fig. 3d). Fig. 3e shows the photographs of different samples. The sample colour gradually changed from pale to dark yellow with the increase in ZnSe thickness. This change indicates the reduction of the bandgap and the increase in light absorption.

The samples from left to right are bare ZnO nanowire, S5 nm, S10 nm, S20 nm, and S50 nm, respectively. 
To examine the nanowire structure and strain characteristics, we performed XRD measurements on different samples. As shown in Fig. 4a, the strong peak at around 34.67° for bare ZnO NWAs; this angle is assigned to the (002) plane of WZ ZnO. The sharp line shape confirmed that ZnO nanowires were grown along the c-axis perpendicular to the substrate; this finding agreed well with the SEM images in Fig. 3a. Apart from the ZnO (002) peak, the zinc blende (ZB) ZnSe (111) peak at 27.43° was observed in the coaxial nanowire samples. Magnified XRD patterns are presented in Fig. 4b and c, showing the increased ZnSe thickness gradually enhanced the intensity of the ZB ZnSe (111) peak, but the peak position almost remained unchanged. The ZnO (002) peak clearly shifted to smaller angles, and this shift confirmed that the tensile strain in the ZnO core was tuned by the thickness of the ZnSe shell to accommodate most of the mismatch stress.

To elucidate the strain and thickness of critical layers, we performed TEM measurements on ZnO/ZnSe coaxial nanowires with different diameters (the diameters of nanowires varied from 10 to 300 nm for our samples, as shown in Fig. 5a). Fig. 5b and c show the low-resolution TEM images. An obvious contrast difference appeared between the core and the shell in Fig. 5b, confirming the formation of the coaxial structure. However, the thinner coaxial nanowire in Fig. 5c has a relatively uniform contrast, revealing the different internal structure based on the TEM image mechanism. To understand the structural difference, high-resolution TEM was conducted to image the cross-sections, particularly at the interface. As shown in Fig. 5d, three distinct regions were recognized for the nanowire with a large ZnO core diameter of tens of nanometers. The ZnO core region exhibited the structural features of the WZ phase. A detailed examination revealed that the lattice spacing of 0.263 nm in the (0001) direction was slightly larger than that of bulk WZ ZnO (0.260 nm; JCPDS card No. 36-1451). Two regions with different phase structures were observed in the ZnSe shell layer. Large mismatch stresses were accommodated by the ZnSe shell near the interface, resulting in the coherent WZ ZnSe formation. As the mismatch stress was relaxed away from the interface, the WZ ZnSe was unable to maintain the stability and the intrinsic nature of ZB ZnSe at a certain critical value. For thinner core nanowires, as shown in Fig. 5e and f, only one coherent WZ structure was recognized in the whole nanowire. The formation of a thick pseudomorphic layer was demonstrated. The lattice spacing of the ZnO core was markedly enlarged approaching to that of bulk WZ ZnSe (0.337 nm). The spacing increased with the ZnSe shell thickness. The results implied that the modifications of the lattice strain and the thickness of the pseudomorphic layer were achieved by changes in the ZnSe thickness.

The electronic structures of the ZnO and ZnO/ZnSe nanowires were investigated by transmission measurements. Fig. 6 shows the transmission spectra of different samples. For bare ZnO nanowires, only one distinct absorption edge was observed at about 3.2 eV, which arises from the ZnO near-band-edge (NBE) absorption, whereas for the coaxial nanowire samples, except for the ZnSe band-edge absorption (∼2.75 eV), there appeared the absorption corresponding to the type-II interfacial transition.21 The absorption threshold was extended from the visible to the infrared region (<0.8 eV) with increased ZnSe shell thickness. The distinguished redshift was attributed to the bandgap reduction of the ZnO core from the increase in strain based on the TEM images. Light absorption between the threshold and the ZnSe band-edge was enhanced because of the broad bandgap distribution of the whole strained layer from different shell-to-core ratios. The superior optical performance of the nanowires with pseudomorphic layers established the basis of producing efficient PV devices with wide-bandgap semiconductors.

Fabrication of solar cells
We assembled the solar cells using the above ZnO/ZnSe coaxial nanowires. Fig. 7a and b show the schematic and photograph of the coaxial nanowire solar cell, respectively. Fig. 7c shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics measured under AM1.5 illumination. The short-circuit current density (Jsc) and the open-circuit voltage (Voc) increased with the ZnSe thickness. The cell with a shell thickness of 50 nm yielded a maximum Jsc of 5.78 mA cm−2 and Voc of 0.63 V. The current value is almost twice that of sensitized solar cells fabricated by ZnO/ZnSe without the pseudomorphic layer.34 The enhancement was elucidated from the EQE curves, as shown in Fig. 7d. Unlike common cells, additional light response appeared in the ZnSe band-edge to the infrared region. Similar to light transmission spectra, the threshold shifted to longer wavelengths with the increase in ZnSe shell thickness. For the S50 nm sample with the maximum critical strain, the value reached 1350 nm, which is almost beyond the NIR region. This result implied that more than 94% of the solar spectral range (Fig. 1a) was absorbed in this cell and corresponded to a 34% enhancement compared to the previously recorded value (770 nm).21 Benefiting from the light response extension, the maximum EQE reached up to 82% around the ZnSe band-edge. As a result, the conversion efficiency reached up to 1.19%, which demonstrated a 75% improvement compared with a similar device without the pseudomorphic layer reported in ref. 34. Additionally, the threshold of the photocurrent response was shorter than that of light absorption by comparing Fig. 7d with Fig. 6, which is attributed to the photo-to-current conversion loss. Despite this loss in our cells, the contribution from the pseudomorphic layer roughly took up over 35% of the whole conversion efficiency (by integrating the region from 460 nm to 1350 nm). The contribution far overweighed 35% because the pseudomorphic layer also responded to wavelengths less than 460 nm. The increased response is attributed to the thinner nanowires (<20 nm) with the larger strain (or the lower EBG) and the thicker pseudomorphic layer. However, the qualified nanowires only hold a very low proportion (about 1%) in our samples. This result means that EQE and conversion efficiency can still be significantly improved by optimizing the nanowire dimension, the thickness of the pseudomorphic layer, and the internal charge collection.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrated the significant extension of the response threshold by the growth and control of pseudomorphic layers in wide-bandgap ZnO/ZnSe coaxial nanowires. Detailed examinations reveal that the critical strain in the thin ZnO core rather than the thick ZnSe shell has a significant role in narrowing the bandgap and reducing the interfacial energy gradient. Light absorption and photoresponse ranges were extended beyond the NIR region to cover up to 94% of the solar power by controlling the critical strain. The results confirm the capability of tuning large bandgaps and the improvement of the solar cell performance through critical strain-induced modification from thick pseudomorphic layers. This work paves the way for stable and efficient PV devices based on wide-bandgap semiconductors. These devices are potential competitors to common narrow-bandgap sensitized solar cells. The increase in light absorption by optimization and device manufacturing technologies to enhance charge collection are subject to further studies.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Solar spectral irradiance at AM1.5. (b) Type-II energy band alignment of the ZnO/ZnSe heterojunction. The solid lines show the natural band alignments, and the dashed lines show the strained ones. The red arrow indicates the effective bandgap caused by the transition from the valence band maximum of ZnSe to the conduction band minimum of ZnO.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) The calculated critical thickness of the pseudomorphic layer as a function of the ZnO core diameter. (b) The dependence of the lattice constant in the c-axis on the coherent thickness ratio of the ZnSe shell and ZnO radius. (c) The calculated band gap of the strained ZnO core as a function of the coherent thickness ratio. (d) Effective bandgap for different strained ZnO/ZnSe coaxial nanowires.	 

 	Fig. 3  Cross-sectional SEM images of: (a) bare ZnO nanowires and (b) ZnO/ZnSe coaxial nanowires with a ZnSe shell thickness of about 5 nm, (c) about 20 nm, and (d) about 50 nm. The image of coaxial nanowires with about 10 nm thick shells is similar to (c). The inset shows the low-resolution TEM images of a single coaxial nanowire. (e) Photographs of the different samples. The samples from left to right are bare ZnO nanowire, S5 nm, S10 nm, S20 nm, and S50 nm, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) XRD patterns of the different samples. (b) Enlarged view of the ZnSe (111) peak. (c) Enlarged view of the ZnO (002) peak.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Top-view SEM image of ZnO/ZnSe coaxial nanowires. Low-resolution TEM images of coaxial nanowires with different diameters, (b) ∼65 nm; (c) ∼25 nm. (d–f) High-resolution TEM images of coaxial nanowires with different diameters.	 

 	Fig. 6  Transmission spectra of bare ZnO nanowires, S5 nm, S10 nm, S20 nm, and S50 nm.	 

 	Fig. 7  (a) Schematic of the ZnO/ZnSe coaxial nanowire solar cell. (b) Photograph of a solar cell. (c) Current density–voltage characteristics of solar cells under illumination of AM1.5 (100 mW cm−2) from a solar simulator. (d) EQE spectra of solar cells for different samples. The inset shows the dependence of the response threshold on the ZnSe shell thickness.
