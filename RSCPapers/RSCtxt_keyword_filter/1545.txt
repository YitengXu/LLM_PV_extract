    , Accepted 5th December 2016First published on 6th December 2016AbstractHerein, we report the unsymmetric effect on the functional (piezoelectric and semiconducting) properties of cadmium-doped 1D-ZnO nanorods (NRs), which have a higher ionic radius (0.97 Å). The growth of Cd-ZnO NRs, which have a hexagonal wurtzite structure without any secondary CdO phases, along the c-axis was confirmed by the XRD patterns, and oxidation states observed from XPS analyses verified the diffusion of Cd2+ into ZnO NRs. A one-fold reduction in the piezoelectric properties was determined by the fabrication of a nanogenerator, and enhancement in the semiconducting properties was studied using an Ag/Cd-ZnO NRs/Ag device with various wt% of Cd doped into the ZnO NRs lattice. Cd-ZnO NRs improve the photogenerated charge carriers (Iph ∼ 330 μA) compared to pure ZnO NRs (Iph ∼ 213 μA), obtained at a bias voltage of 10 V, a wavelength of 365 nm and a light intensity of 8 mW cm−2. The Cd-ZnO NRs (1 wt%) based sensor shows good photoresponse with a detectivity (D*) limit of 1 × 1011 cm H1/2 W−1 compared to that of pure ZnO NRs (D* = 5.4 × 1010 cm H1/2 W−1). We also demonstrate a self-powered UV sensor (SPUV-S) connected parallel to the ZnO NRs based nanogenerator as an independent power source to drive the Cd-ZnO NRs UV sensor. The low-temperature hydrothermal synthesis of Cd-ZnO NRs is simple, cost-effective, and scalable for industrial applications.
Introduction
The development of self-powered systems using energy harvesting technologies, such as piezoelectric,1 photoelectric,2 pyroelectric,3 electromagnetic,4 and triboelectric1 devices, has attained great interest. Over the last decade, the piezoelectric nanogenerator (P-NG) technology has tremendously improved due to advances in the device structure,1 the growth of piezoelectric nanostructures on various flexible substrates,5,6 doping effects7 and the use of composite devices (inorganic nanoparticles/polymer matrix).8 The P-NG can act as an independent power source to drive micro-/nanodevices, and in some cases, the P-NG itself acts as a self-powered device.9 An extensive survey on the generation of power for these materials shows that the power density obtained using 1D or 2D-ZnO P-NGs lies between the μW cm−2 and mW cm−210,11 range, and the power density of composite P-NGs lies between the mW cm−2 and W cm−2 range.12,13 Currently, many researchers are focusing on the tuning of 1D-ZnO functional properties, such as piezoelectric, optical and semiconducting properties, for improving the sensor performance and energy generation. ZnO is a very versatile material, with an energy band gap of 3.2 eV, which exists in several nanostructure forms, such as nanowires, nanoflakes, nanotubes, nanoribbons and nanorods.14,15 Herein, the selection of a foreign atom or doping material for the ZnO nanostructures will play a key role in tuning its properties and controlling its suitability for the desired application.16,17 Recent reports have demonstrated that the piezoelectric coefficient of ZnO can be improved using metals such as vanadium (V),18 magnesium (Mg),19 lithium (Li),20 palladium (Pd),21 iron (Fe),22 aluminum (Al),23 cobalt (Co),24 copper (Cu),25 and silver (Ag),26 as doping materials, and non-metals such as sulfur (S)27 and phosphorus (P)28 have induced ferroelectric behavior in ZnO-based P-NGs, resulting in high piezoelectric response. A few other reports have demonstrated that doping with group III elements can be used for different applications as follows: Al-doped and In-doped ZnO thin films serve as an alternative to transparent conducting oxide (TCO), and Ga-doped ZnO (GZO) has been used in flat-panel displays and solar cells.29 In addition to doping with transition metals (TM), rare earth elements, such as erbium (Er),30 lanthanum (La),31 and europium (Eu),32 have recently been widely used to improve the luminescence properties of 1D-ZnO nanomaterials. Despite the availability of many reports that focus specifically on the modification of a particular property, there is still a lack of studies that address the asymmetric influence of the doping material on the semiconducting and piezoelectric nature of 1D-ZnO and its usefulness for electronic applications. This motivates us to develop and analyze the symmetric tuning of piezoelectric/semiconducting properties for hydrothermally grown 1D-ZnO nanorods (ZnO NRs) using cadmium as the dopant. Cadmium chalcogenides are technically an important class of materials owing to their widespread utility in electronic and optoelectronic devices. For narrowing the band gaps, the cadmium dopant would be an appropriate candidate, which has a band gap of 2.38 eV.33 Cd-ZnO NRs (with a Cd concentration of <1 wt%) have a significantly improved UV response and, simultaneously, a reduced piezoelectric performance compared to undoped ZnO NRs. We also identified the Cd doping limit for ZnO, i.e., doping with ≤1 wt% of Cd2+ results in perfect diffusion of the dopant ions into the Zn2+ site and doping with >1 wt% of Cd2+ creates a secondary or an impurity phase in the ZnO NRs. The concentration of <1 wt% Cd used is within the permissible exposure limit of 2.5 μg per cubic meter of air34 and also within the level of median lethal dose of order Cd (890 mg kg−1) < CdO (72 mg kg−1) which is environmentally acceptable.35 Here, vertically aligned (c-axis orientation) ZnO and Cd-ZnO NRs on glass substrates were used to investigate the semiconducting behavior. The reduction in the piezoelectric performance was analyzed using an ITO/Cd-ZnO NRs-PDMS/Al device. Finally, we successfully developed a self-powered UV photosensor (SPUV-S) with the parallel connection between two devices, e.g., Cd-ZnO NRs were used as a UV sensor and undoped ZnO NRs were used as a power source (nanogenerator). The proposed method is simple, cost effective and suitable for large scale fabrication.
Experimental
Synthesis of ZnO and Cd-ZnO NRs
The synthesis of ZnO NRs and cadmium-doped ZnO (Cd-ZnO) NRs was carried out using a hydrothermal method. To grow the ZnO NRs, a precursor solution was prepared using an equimolar ratio of zinc acetate dihydrate [Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O] as the starting material and hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) as a stabilizer, which also acts as the growth-directing agent, in aqueous medium. A 0.2 M solution of [Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O] and HMT was poured into a container and stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature. Cd-ZnO NRs were synthesized by adding different concentrations (0.1, 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 wt%) of cadmium reagent, cadmium acetate dihydrate [Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O], into the precursor solution. The pH value of the medium was adjusted to 10 by adding sodium hydroxide (NaOH), which in turn produces a clear solution. After 30 minutes of constant stirring, the as-synthesized precursor solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and soaked at a temperature of 150 °C for 24 h. A white precipitate was collected and washed several times using water and ethanol until it reached a neutral pH value. Next, the solution was dried overnight at 60 °C and calcined at 500 °C for 1.5 h to improve the crystallinity of the NRs.
Fabrication of randomly oriented Cd-doped ZnO NRs-based piezoelectric nanogenerators
The fabricated piezoelectric nanogenerator (P-NG) with a device area of 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm has the following four major parts: Cd-ZnO NRs (0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1 wt%) as the active material, the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix as an insulating layer, ITO and Al foil as the bottom and top electrodes, and Kapton film as a protective frame from external environmental factors. Firstly, ITO-coated PET substrates were cleaned using ethanol, acetone and deionized (DI) water. Four devices were fabricated by depositing different active materials on the ITO/PET substrates, such as undoped ZnO NRs, 0.1 wt% Cd-ZnO NRs, 0.5 wt% Cd-ZnO NRs and 1 wt% Cd-ZnO NRs, which are designated as P-NG, P-NG1, P-NG2, and P-NG3, respectively. The as-synthesized NRs were sonicated, dispersed in 1 ml of ethanol, spin-coated onto the cleaned PET/ITO substrates at 2500 rpm for 30 seconds and treated at 65 °C for 10 minutes. This process was repeated five times to ensure good uniformity and to achieve a substrate that was densely covered with the active material. A thin layer of fine PDMS (10:1) was spin-coated on the NRs/ITO/PET substrate at 5000 rpm for 60 seconds and cured overnight at 80 °C in a hot oven. A low-cost flexible Al foil (15 μm) was attached on top of the PDMS/NRs/ITO/PET substrate to serve as a top electrode. Two copper conducting leads were glued with silver paste on the two electrodes (ITO & Al) and used for measuring the performance of the P-NGs. Finally, the flexible P-NGs, with a PET/ITO/NRs/PDMS/Al device structure, were covered with Kapton film to ensure their protection from environmental changes and external damage, as shown in Fig. 3(a). To improve the polarization, all P-NG devices were electrically poled by applying an electric field of 4 kV for 24 h at room temperature; the dipoles were preferentially oriented with respect to the direction of the applied electric field.
Fabrication of vertically aligned Cd-doped ZnO NR arrays-based UV-sensors (UV-Ss)
The glass substrates were initially cleaned by successive sonication in ethanol, acetone and DI water. To prepare the seed layer solution, zinc acetate dihydrate (0.5 M) was dissolved in aqueous medium and stirred for 2 h at 60 °C. The solubility of the precursor salt was improved by adding 1 M monoethanolamine (C2H7NO, MEA), which acts as a stabilizer. The seed layer sol was aged for 24 h, and then it was spin-coated on pre-cleaned glass substrates at 2500 rpm for 30 seconds followed by heat treatment for 10 minutes at 200 °C. This coating process was repeated three times to obtain uniformity and achieve the desired thickness of the seed layer. Then, the substrates were annealed for 1 h at 600 °C. ZnO NRs were hydrothermally grown at 90 °C for 6 h by immersing the seed-layered glass substrates in the nutrient solution consisting of equal moles of Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O and HMT (0.2 M), which was adjusted to a pH of 10. For different concentrations of Cd-ZnO NRs, the same procedure was repeated with the addition of Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O into the nutrient solution, where the Cd to Zn precursor weight ratio was maintained at 0.1 wt%, 0.5 wt% and 1 wt%. After the reaction was completed, the glass substrates were rinsed with DI water and dried in an oven at 60 °C. Two copper wires, within a defined area of 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm, were attached using a constant amount of Ag paste for electrical measurements; this completed the fabrication of UV-S devices, as shown in Fig. 4(a). The distance between the electrodes was 0.2 cm.
Measurement system
The morphological structure, particle size distribution and layer thickness of ZnO and Cd-ZnO NRs were analyzed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Zeiss Supra-55vp, Germany and JEOL JSM-6700F, Japan). The phase composition and the lattice strain induced by the Cd dopant in as-prepared ZnO NRs were determined with an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku, Japan) operated at 40 kV and a current of 40 mA using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) at room temperature (with a 2θ range from 20° to 80°). The absorbance spectrum in the range of 200–800 nm was recorded with a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Cary300, Varian system, USA). Raman spectra were recorded from 200 to 800 cm−1 at an excitation wavelength of 514 nm using a high-throughput single-stage spectrometer (LabRAM HR Evolution; Horiba, Japan). Elemental analysis of the samples was carried out using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Theta Probe AR-XPS system). Piezoelectric measurements of P-NG devices were carried out using the mechanical force triggered by a linear motor system (LinMot-HF01-37) operated at an acceleration of 1 m s−2, and the results were recorded using a high-impedance electrometer (6514) and a low-noise current pre-amplifier (SR570). The photo-responsive I–V measurements were recorded using a semiconductor device parameter analyzer (Agilent-B1500A) with the help of a Prizmatix multi-wavelength LED light source operated at wavelengths of 365 nm, 405 nm and 535 nm at different intensities.
Results and discussion
Structural and surface morphology analyses of Cd-ZnO NRs
The XRD patterns of Cd-doped crystalline ZnO NRs with Cd = 0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1 wt% are shown in Fig. 1(a). All the peaks are indexed to the wurtzite structure of ZnO (space group P63mc) and the patterns exhibit a strong (101) peak with a c-axis orientation.36 There are no secondary phases or clusters observed for the doping concentrations (0.1–1 wt%) of Cd, which indicates that Cd2+ ions are perfectly dissolved in the ZnO lattice. Fig. 1(b) shows possible peak shifts in the (100), (002), (101) peaks towards lower angles, i.e., from 31.67°, 34.33°, and 36.16° to 31.65°, 34.31°, and 36.14°, respectively, as the Cd concentration increased. This is due to the substitution of Cd2+ with a higher ionic radius (0.97 Å) in Zn2+ (0.74 Å) ionic sites. Changes in the diffraction peaks towards lower angles indicate that Cd is incorporated into the wurtzite lattice also confirming the increase in wt% of Cd in 1D-ZnO NRs. In the case of higher Cd doping concentrations of 1.5 wt% and 2 wt%, the strongest reflection of the cubic Cd phase appeared with low intensity (Fig. S4, ESI†), which indicates phase separation due to the formation of CdO. The expansion of the unit cell as a result of Cd2+ substitution creates an internal strain of approximately 0.28% on the grown NRs, which reduces the crystallite size from 46.5 nm to 43.14 nm. The calculated lattice parameters are a = b = 3.25 Å and c = 5.20 Å (undoped ZnO NRs), and a = b = 3.26 Å and c = 5.22 Å (1 wt% Cd-doped ZnO NRs). The c/a ratio confirms the perfect hexagonal wurtzite structure of the NRs. The increase in the lattice parameters is due to the expansion of the unit cell volume, which is an effect of the ionic radii mismatch between Zn2+ and Cd2+.

Low- and high-magnification FESEM images of undoped ZnO NRs and synthesized 1 wt% Cd-ZnO NRs are shown in Fig. 1(c) and (d). The images reveal that the as-prepared NRs are uniformly grown, and they exhibit a good rod-shaped morphology after the hydrothermal treatment. The diameter of NRs ranges between 100 and 150 nm and the length of the NRs is approximately 1 μm. It should be noted that the controlled concentration of Cd doping (<1 wt%) does not hinder the morphological structure of NRs, whereas phase separation occurs as the Cd concentration is increased (>1 wt%), which leads to the deterioration of NRs due to increased replacement of smaller Zn2+ ions (0.74 Å) by larger Cd2+ ions (0.97 Å) (Fig. S5, ESI†). Fig. S6 (ESI†) shows the seed layered growth of hexagonal wurtzite NRs, which are vertically well aligned and densely packed on the glass substrates along the homogeneous growth direction with a layer thickness of ∼3 μm (Fig. 4(d)).
The absorbance spectrum was recorded using a UV-Vis spectrometer to obtain the optical energy band gap (Eg) from the Tauc plot. The variation of the absorption coefficient (α) with the photon energy (hν) is given by the following equation: (αhν)2 = C(hν − Eg)(1)where C is a constant, h is the Planck constant, and ν is the photon frequency. Fig. 1(e) shows the absorbance spectra and Tauc plots of undoped ZnO NRs and 1 wt% Cd-doped ZnO NRs. Extrapolating the linear region of the (αhν)2vs. (hν) plot on the x-axis gives the value of the optical band gap (Eg). The absorption edge of the ZnO NRs clearly shifts to the red region due to Cd substitution, which results in a band gap reduction from 3.2 to 3.17 eV. This is because Cd doping increases the contribution of Cd-5s states in the conduction band, which have lower energy than Zn-4s states. The predominant existence of the Zn-4s state is altered by Cd-5s, which in turn leads to the reduction in the band gap of Cd-ZnO NRs.37 The red-shift of the optical band gap after Cd doping can also be attributed to the Moss–Burstein effect where doped elements cause a shift in the Fermi energy level as a result of electrons generated by oxygen vacancies. The band gap tuning is confirmed by both the shift in the (002) XRD peaks and the red-shift in the UV-Vis spectrum.
Furthermore, the vibration properties of undoped and Cd-doped ZnO NRs were analyzed by Raman spectroscopy with excitation at a wavelength of 514 nm. From Fig. 1(f), strong peaks are observed for undoped ZnO NRs at 386 cm−1, 445 cm−1, and 340 cm−1. The peak at 386 cm−1 is assigned to the A1 (TO) mode, the peak at 445 cm−1 corresponds to the optical photon E2 (high) mode, and the peak at 340 cm−1 (E2H–E2L) represents the secondary multi-photon scattering mode, which appears due to dimensional confinement (1D-NRs) of the synthesized ZnO. A low intensity peak that contributes to the E1 (LO) mode exists at 583 cm−1; it represents the defect sites in ZnO NRs.37,38 With the addition of Cd dopants, the peak at 583 cm−1 broadens along with a shift of the E2 (high) mode to 443 cm−1, which is associated with the replacement of Zn2+ ions by larger size Cd2+ ions; this subsequently induces crystallite stress and creates more defect zones, such as oxygen vacancies (Vo) and zinc interstitials (Zni). A similar effect is observed for vertically grown undoped and 1 wt% Cd-doped ZnO NRs (Fig. S7, ESI†).
The elemental composition and chemical states due to Cd doping in the ZnO matrix are identified by determining the line energies (binding energies) in the XPS spectra. Fig. 2(a) and (b) shows the peaks of C, O, Zn and Cd in the XPS spectra of undoped ZnO NRs and 1 wt% Cd-ZnO NRs. The elemental results show that there is no appearance of additional peaks in the final end product. This confirms that the synthesized ZnO NRs are highly pure and free from other impurities (Fig. S3, ESI†).The presence of elemental carbon was identified from the C1s peak at 284.6 eV, which appears due to the exposure of materials to the environment. The appearance of two strong peaks at 1021.5 eV and 1044.6 eV represents the formation of Zn–O bonds39 (Fig. 2(c)). Upon addition of 1 wt% of Cd dopant, the Zn 2p3/2 peak shifted from 1021.5 eV to 1021.8 eV and the Zn 2p1/2 peak shifted to a higher binding energy from 1044.6 eV to 1044.9 eV. The increased binding energy (0.3 eV) is due to the interaction between the electronic states of Zn2+ and Cd2+ ions. Fig. 2(d) shows the high-resolution Cd 3d XPS spectra of 1 wt% Cd-ZnO NRs. The peaks at binding energies of 404.8 eV and 411.5 eV are assigned to Cd 3d, and they can be attributed to Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2, respectively.40,41Fig. 2(e) and (f) presents the analysis of Gaussian fitting curves of the O1s spectra of undoped ZnO and 1 wt% Cd-doped ZnO NRs. The O1s peak at 529.9 eV is attributed to O2− ions in the wurtzite structure of the Zn2+ ion array, which are surrounded by Zn, while the higher binding energy O2 species, centered at 531 eV, belong to the oxygen-deficient region caused by the oxygen vacancies.37,41 The Cd-doped ZnO NRs have more donor content (such as oxygen vacancies) than the undoped ZnO.37 The Cd content of as-grown ZnO NRs is estimated from the integrated peak areas to be approximately 0.38 atomic %, indicative of a larger donor level compared to undoped ZnO NRs.

Significance of Cd doping in 1D ZnO NRs

Degradation of piezoelectric response. 
The P-NG (1.5 cm × 1.5 cm) made using spin-coated NRs on a bottom PET/ITO electrode and a low-cost Al foil/Kapton top electrode is shown schematically in Fig. 3(a). A thin layer of PDMS was used between the top Al electrode and the top of the NRs to prevent electrical breakdown during poling, and it also provides flexibility and reliability to the P-NG under excessive mechanical force. A cross-sectional FESEM analysis reveals that the fabricated PNG devices are approximately 332 μm in thickness. The spin-coated ZnO/PDMS layers together give a thickness of ≈36 μm (Fig. S8, ESI†). Similarly, we fabricated Cd-doped ZnO NRs-based devices with different Cd concentrations of 0.1, 0.5 and 1 wt% in the ZnO NRs, which are referred to as P-NG1, P-NG2 and P-NG3, respectively. The electrical response (VOC, ISC) of the poled P-NG device under a constant mechanical load of 2 N (obtained by a linear motor shaft mass (2 kg) moving with an acceleration of 1 m s−2) is shown in Fig. 3(b) and (c). Initially, the P-NG device generates a maximum output, e.g., VOC ≈ 36 V and ISC ≈ 286 μA, for a 2 N load. This output is high and comparable to that in many published reports.11,16,42,43Fig. 3(d) shows the durability test, which proves that the P-NG is capable of producing a stable output performance during a 1200 second time interval under a load of 2 N.

(d) Stability analysis of the P-NG for a time interval of 1200 seconds (under a 2 N load). (e) Electrical voltage and current as a function of Cd concentration. (f) Load resistance analysis and power density evaluation for the P-NG device under a constant load of 2 N. 
Next, we obtained the electrical response of Cd-doped ZnO NRs-based devices (0.1, 0.5 and 1 wt% of Cd in ZnO NRs), and the corresponding output shows a decreasing trend with respect to the Cd concentration, as observed in Fig. 3(b) and (c). The Cd dopant screens the piezoelectric output potential by producing excessive holes and defect sites, which result in a gradual decrease in the performance of the P-NG. The results show that the ferroelectric property is still induced in the Cd-doped P-NG; however, the dopant Cd element is unsuitable for improving the piezoelectric output. To further investigate the optimum output power density of the P-NG device (without doping), we conducted electrical measurements for various load resistance values ranging from 10 kΩ to 3 GΩ. Here, the output voltage increases with respect to the load resistance value for a constant load of 2 N; in contrast, the output current decreases with respect to the load resistance, as shown in Fig. 3(f). The maximum power density obtained is approximately 0.41 μW cm−2 at 300 MΩ; it can be evaluated by the following equation: (2)where R is the load resistance across the P-NG, A is the surface area and V is the electrical output voltage obtained.
By introducing a very small amount of Cd, the crystallographic alignment of the unit cell of the ZnO crystal is distorted. When the Cd doping concentration is further increased, there is a high loss in the symmetry of the unit cell, which results in a reduction in the piezoelectric response. This may be attributed to the difference in the ionic radii, where the ionic radius of Cd2+ (0.97 Å) is larger than that of Zn2+ (0.74 Å). Therefore, the lattice parameter (c) is increased when Cd2+ substitutes Zn2+, which leads to deformation in the crystallinity and c-axis orientation of ZnO NRs. In addition to the induced effect of stress by the Cd atoms, the electromechanical response of the P-NG depends on the spontaneous polarization (Ps),44 which is given by the following equation: d33 = 2Qeffε0εrPs(3)where Qeff is the effective electrostriction coefficient, ε0 is the permittivity of free space and εr represents the relative permittivity. From this equation, we find that the piezoelectric response (d33) in ferroelectrics such as ZnO is directly dependent on Ps. The polarization of the domain is mainly governed by the rotation and bending of non-collinear bonds formed between transition metals and oxygen along the c-axis44 (here, the transition metals are Zn and Cd). In Cd-doped ZnO NRs, a few of the Zn2+ ions are replaced by Cd2+ ions that induces a strain due to the difference in ionic radii between Cd2+ (0.97 Å) and Zn2+ (0.74 Å). In order to balance the strain, Cd2+ moves towards the existing point defect sites (Vo) in ZnO crystals, thereby increasing the bond length between Cd and O.45 The volume of a ZnO NRs unit cell system gets expanded due to the elongation of the Cd–O bond length.46 This increase in bond length restricts the switching of Cd2+–O1 towards the c-axis. Even under an applied electric field, the rotation of the Cd2+–O1 bond is difficult compared to that of the Zn2+–O1 bond, which reduces the switching polarization and contributes to a poor piezoelectric co-efficient (d33). As the length of the bond corresponds to the c-axis orientation in wurtzite crystals in a parallel manner, we determined the bond length (b) using its relationship between the internal parameter (u = 3/8) and the lattice parameter (c) given by the following equation:47,48 (4)
The bond length of Cd2+–O1 is calculated to be 1.957 Å, which is higher than that of Zn2+–O1 (1.950 Å). This has contributed to the decrease in the electromechanical response of P-NG1, P-NG2 and P-NG3.


Enhancement of UV-photoresponse. 
To investigate the electrical performance, metal (M)–semiconductor (S)–metal (M) type UV-sensors (UV-Ss) were developed using 0, 0.5 and 1 wt% Cd-doped ZnO NRs; the device structure is schematically shown in Fig. 4(a). The UV-S performance was analyzed in different environments, including a dark environment and under various light sources with wavelengths of 365 nm, 405 nm and 535 nm. An ohmic electrical contact was obtained for UV-S (ZnO NRs), UV-S0.5 (0.5 wt% of Cd) and UV-S1 (1 wt% of Cd), which can be analyzed by the dark currents (ID) of both devices under an applied dc bias voltage of 10 V. Since the work function of Ag is 4.26 eV, which is less than that of ZnO (5.2 eV), the barrier at the interface of metal–semiconductor–metal (M–S–M) is reduced; thus, the contact between ZnO and Ag is likely to be ohmic.49 Also Cd doping enhances the n-type charge carrier concentration in ZnO NRs and reduces the barrier height (ΦB) for the charge carriers to tunnel through the M–S–M interface resulting in the formation of ohmic contacts.50 In Fig. 5(a), the dark current (ID) decreases gradually with an increase in Cd concentration (UV-S1 (2 μA) < UV-S0.5 (2.5 μA) < UV-S (2.9 μA)), which shows that Cd is been effectively doped into the lattice of ZnO NRs. This confirms that more oxygen vacancy sites are created by Cd doping, which favored the adsorption of more oxygen molecules on the surface of Cd-ZnO NRs.51 This in turn reduced the number of free charge carriers that contribute to the generation of ID. Under a UV light source (8 mW cm−2), the photocurrent response of devices varies proportionally with respect to the Cd-doping concentrations. Fig. 5(b) shows the photoresponse spectra of a UV-S under UV illumination at a wavelength of 365 nm and with an optical light intensity of 8 mW cm−2. The photocurrent of the UV-S is 213 μA, which steadily increases to 250 μA as the Cd concentration increases to 0.5 wt% and reaches 330 μA for 1 wt% Cd-ZnO NRs (UV-S1). The dependence of photocurrent response as a function of Cd presence in the vertically grown ZnO NRs is illustrated in Fig. 5(c). A one-fold increment of the photocurrent (Iph) response was observed for UV-S1, which makes it more suitable for fabricating high performance photodetectors. The dependence of the light intensity on the photocurrent of UV-S was analyzed by varying the intensity of the light source (8, 16 and 27 mW cm−2) at 365 nm. The increase in the light intensity across UV-S1 will increase the Iph response due to the generation of more photogenerated charge carriers in UV-S1. This clearly demonstrates that the as-fabricated sensor is highly sensitive to various light intensities of the 365 nm UV-source (Fig. 5(d)). Then, the selectivity of UV-S1 was analyzed by investigating its performance under 405 nm (blue) and 535 nm (green) excitation light sources at different light intensities, and the results are summarized in Fig. 5(e) and (f). The results indicate that UV-S1 is completely inactive for the source with a wavelength of 535 nm, but a linear Iph response was observed for UV-S1 under the 405 nm source with various light intensities. This Iph response is much lower than the Iph response of UV-S1 under the 365 nm source. A similar analysis was performed for UV-S and UV-S0.5, and its corresponding results are given in Fig. S9 (ESI†). The behavior of UV-S1 is attributed to the difference in the photon energy of various excitation sources. This illustrates that UV-S1 is highly selective to the wavelength of 365 nm, and further analyses are carried out at this specific wavelength. The performance of this sensor is estimated by its photo-responsivity (Rλ) at a specific wavelength, which is defined as follows: (5)where Iph and ID are currents when the photodetector is under illumination and in the dark, PL is the illumination intensity and S is the illuminated device area. The calculated maximum photo-responsivity (R365nm) of the fabricated UV-S is 105 mA W−1, which is less than the UV-S1 photo-responsivity (164 mA W−1) at 8 mW m−2. Fig. 6(a) and (b) show the effect of photo-responsivity as a function of varied light intensities, and the photo-responsivity is fitted by a power law as follows: Iph = APθ, where Iph is the photocurrent, A is a constant at a particular wavelength, P is the light intensity, and θ is a parameter that determines the photocurrent response of the devices. It is observed that an increase in the light intensity will result in a decrease in the responsivity factor at 365 nm (R365nm). The higher exponent value of UV-S1 compared to UV-S indicates that Cd atoms induced more trap defect sites and a higher recombination of electron–hole pairs, which contributed to the large Iph.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was estimated from Rλ as (6)and fitted with a suitable power law, as shown in Fig. 6(c) and (d). The sensor performance was further estimated by determining the parameters such as photoconductive gain (G) and detectivity (D*), which are given by the following: (7) (8)where q is the elementary charge carrier; I = Iph − ID; P is the incident power and h is the Planck constant. The proposed UV-S1 response parameters are examined with those reported for UV-S and the values are summarized in Table 1. A higher detectivity of 1 × 1011 cm H1/2 W−1 is estimated for UV-S1, which decreases as the light intensity increases. This indicates that the fabricated M–S–M based sensor is highly UV-sensitive to low-power measurements. A comparative performance analysis of UV-S1 with other sensors is listed in Table S1 (ESI†). Fig. 7(a) shows the time-dependent response and recovery spectra of UV-S and UV-S1. The high Ion/Ioff ratio of the UV-S1 device shows that charge transport is enhanced by the replacement of Zn2+ by Cd2+ ions (Fig. 7(b)). The fabricated sensors were reversibly turned on/off during a 60 second time interval by switching the UV illumination (365 nm) with a light intensity of 8 mW cm−2 at an applied bias of 10 V. The Iph of UV-S and UV-S1 increases as the UV light was turned on for a time interval of 60 seconds and the Iph decreases slowly once the UV source is switched off. The generation of Iph for UV-S1 is much higher than the Iph of UV-S for a limited time, which demonstrates the effect of the Cd dopant on ZnO NRs. A long decay time is observed for both UV-S and UV-S1 due to the presence of oxygen vacancy sites and the re-adsorption of O2 molecules on the surfaces of NRs.52 The response time (τR) and recovery time (τD) are determined by estimating the time required to approach 63% (∼1 − e−1) of the maximum Iph from ID and the time required for the recovery to 37% (∼e−1) of the maximum Iph. Fig. 7(c) and (d) illustrates the calculated rise time (τR) and decay time (τD) as 24 and 23 seconds, respectively, for UV-S and 8 and 10 seconds, respectively, for UV-S1. The faster response time is achieved for UV-S1 based on 1 wt% Cd-ZnO NRs, which illustrates the role of the Cd dopant in modulating the trap sites on the surface of nanorods.

The role of Cd in modulating the semiconducting properties is discussed by considering the charge transport model (Fig. 4(b)). When the bias voltage of 10 V is applied to UV-S at ambient room temperature, oxygen molecules from the environment are adsorbed onto the surface of ZnO NRs [O2(g) + e− → O2(abs)−].53 This results in lower electron density and mobility of charge carriers, which are controlled by the formation of a depletion layer near the surface of ZnO NRs. Upon illumination with UV light, electrons (e−) and holes (h+) are generated across the surface of the UV-S [ZnO NRs + hν → e−(CB) + h+(VB)]. Due to the difference in the surface potential, the photogenerated holes migrate to the surface to react with O2(abs)−, thereby releasing the trapped electrons into the conduction band (CB) [h+ + O2(abs)− → O2(g)].53 Under these conditions, the excess e− available inside the NRs have a lower chance of recombining with the holes because insufficient h+ are available due to the liberation of O2(g). This increases the movement of electron charge carriers and consequently leads to higher photocurrent (Iph) compared to ID ∼ 2.9 μA (Fig. 5). In the case of the UV-S1 device comprising 1 wt% Cd-ZnO NRs as the sensing layer, the Iph generated is double the magnitude of the photocurrent from the UV-S. The replacement of Zn2+ by Cd2+ contributes to more donor defects, which act as a source for improving the n-type carrier concentration of ZnO and thus create more zinc interstitials (Zni) and oxygen deficiency sites (Vo). This increase in the vacancy defect zones produces a platform for the adsorption of more O2 molecules on the surface of NRs, thus lowering the ID (∼2 μA) of UV-S1. When exposed to UV-illumination, excess amounts of e− are released that are trapped by the formation of O2(abs)− molecules, thus increasing the electron intensity inside the Cd-ZnO NRs. When UV-light is turned off, the photocurrent degrades gradually due to recombination of the excess e− with h+ and the re-adsorption of O2 molecules on the surface by the capture of few e−. The slow recovery time for the sensor is due to the slow recombination of the e−–h+ pair. In addition to the adsorption and desorption mechanisms, the sensor performance depends on the band gap modulation due to Cd doping. Fig. 4(e) shows the energy band diagram of the sensor. Due to a higher work function of ZnO (ΦS = 5.2 eV) than that of Ag (ΦM = 4.2 eV), which is used as an electrode, the energy band bends at the metal–semiconductor–metal interface, which indicates the tunneling of e− from the conduction band of ZnO NRs to the Ag electrode to achieve the equilibrium Fermi-level (EF), whereas the h+ on the surface of NRs establishes a strong ohmic contact.49 When Cd doping occurs, the band gap of ZnO NRs is red-shifted from 3.2 eV to 3.17 eV (Fig. 1(e)). This reduced the barrier height, ΦB, of the ZnO material, which ensures that the barrier width becomes thin enough for the tunneling of electrons at the metal–semiconductor–metal interface and produces high conductivity and photocurrent from the UV-S1 device.

Realization of a self-powered UV-sensor (SPUV-S)
A SPUV-S was developed using the parallel connection between the UV-S1 (1 wt% of Cd-doped ZnO NRs) and P-NG (only ZnO NRs) devices, as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). The voltage drop across the sensor was measured to estimate the performance of the SPUV-S at various wavelengths (365 nm, 405 nm) and UV-illumination intensities. To determine the effect of Cd doping, measurements were conducted using the UV-S for an effective comparison with UV-S1. Initially, when sensor devices (UV-S and UV-S1) are not connected, the P-NG delivers the maximum peak voltage (20 V), which then shows a considerable voltage drop from 20 V to ∼17 V when the sensors are connected in parallel to the P-NG (Fig. 8(a) and (b)). This indicates that the internal resistances of UV-S and UV-S1 are much less than the internal resistance of P-NG. Upon irradiation of a 365 nm UV light, the UV-S1 resistance drops and the peak voltage reduces to 40 mV when the illuminated light intensity increases, as shown in the inset of Fig. 8(b). The voltage drop for UV-S1 is higher than that for UV-S, indicating that more free charge carriers are produced by Cd doping in ZnO NRs, which reduces the resistance across the sensor and thus results in an obvious increase in the voltage drop of UV-S1. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the self-powered performance of the UV-S under blue (405 nm) light was examined. When the wavelength is increased to 405 nm, the UV-S shows a small variation in voltage due to less absorption of photon energy from the light source, while UV-S1 is still highly responsive due to tuning of the band gap (3.17 eV) in Cd-ZnO NRs (Fig. 8(c) and (d)). Our experimental results demonstrate that the substitution of Cd dopants into ZnO NRs will symmetrically decrease the piezoelectric properties while improving the UV-photoresponse behavior.

Conclusions
In summary, the asymmetric effect of the reduction in piezoelectric properties and the increase in the semiconducting behavior of ZnO NRs due to the substitution of Cd dopants were reported. UV-S1 (1 wt% of Cd) showed good photoresponse with a detectivity (D*) limit of 1 × 1011 cm H1/2 W−1, which is higher than that of UV-S (pure ZnO NRs) (D* = 5.4 × 1010 cm H1/2 W−1). In addition, the sensitivity of the UV-S1 device to various excitation light sources and power intensities was examined, and this confirms the enhanced UV sensing efficiency (η) and responsivity (Rλ) at 365 nm. Moreover, the ferroelectric property of ZnO NRs was greatly affected by the Cd atom, which led to a simultaneous reduction in the piezoelectric output from VOC = 36 V, ISC = 284 μA (pure ZnO NRs) to VOC = 15 V, ISC = 178 μA (1 wt% Cd-doped ZnO NRs). These findings show that Cd doping in ZnO is unsuitable for energy conversion applications, such as applications that convert mechanical to electrical energy; in contrast, Cd doping enhances the semiconducting properties of ZnO, which is very useful in the development of optoelectronic devices. In addition, the pure ZnO NRs-based nanogenerator and the Cd-ZnO NRs photo-sensor are useful for the development of next-generation self-powered devices.
