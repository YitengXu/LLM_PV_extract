    , Accepted 19th June 2015First published on 19th June 2015AbstractPolyoxometalate (POM) layers have been used to realize efficient and long-term stable single-junction polymer photovoltaic devices with diverse configuration and donor:acceptor combination in the photoactive blend and polymer tandem cells through functioning as effective hole extraction layers and, also, as recombination layers in the interconnecting unit of the tandem cell. Their unique properties, such as their extremely high work function (WF) of 6.0–6.2 eV, their high degree of crystallinity without any post annealing requirements and, especially, the position of their lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), were used to control the characteristics of optoelectronic devices. It was found that POMs having a deep LUMO level lying below the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor polymer are highly beneficial for device operation due to the interfacial p-doping of the latter. We demonstrated conventional and reverse structure single-junction cells reaching an efficiency of 7.9% in the latter case and a tandem cell with an efficiency of 9.9% using an all solution processed inverted structure, where a POM layer simultaneously offers enhanced hole extraction in the sub-cells and minimal losses in the recombination unit. The specific properties of four POM materials and their role as functional layers in those different types of polymer photovoltaic devices are discussed.

Broader context
The need to curb climate changes has become a matter of utmost urgency. In the attempt to reduce carbon emissions, solar cells have been touted as the ultimate green solution. As a clean and renewable energy source, solar cells can ease the strain on diminishing oil reserves. Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are among the faster-growing energy technologies of solar cells in the world today and a leading candidate for carbon-free electricity generation owing to their easy fabrication, low cost, solution processability and mechanical flexibility. However, the efficiencies of organic solar cells are still much lower than that of a commercialized solar cell. Therefore, effective techniques for improving the efficiencies of organic solar cells are urgently needed. Here, we report a novel technique for improving the efficiencies of organic solar cells by introducing a solution processed highly crystalline polyoxometalate layer without any post annealing requirements to serve as the hole transport/extraction element in OPV cells. We also find that the band structure of the polyoxometalate layer is critical to the efficiency enhancement because the energy levels of the molecular orbitals can influence p-type doping of the photoactive layer and the energy barrier for hole extraction. More importantly, polymer tandem cells using polyoxometalates as charge recombination layers are also demonstrated. The technique is convenient and cost effective since there are plenty of choices in using members of the large family of polyoxometalates and it paves a way for realizing high-performance organic solar cells in the near future.

1. Introduction
In the era of rapidly increasing energy demands and dwindling conventional energy resources, there is a pressing need to develop alternate energy sources. This has resulted in increasing the amount of research being devoted to new types of solar energy harvesting devices such as photovoltaic cells which convert abundant, free solar radiation into electric power. Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) based on conjugated polymers have attracted increasing attention as a future renewable energy source since they offer the simultaneous combination of mechanical flexibility, low-cost fabrication processes and long-term sustainability advantages – in terms of energy payback time and global warming potential – when compared to silicon and other photovoltaic technologies.1–5 Since the early reports of planar heterojunction devices,6 OPV cells have seen rapid progress, much of it owing to the development of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architecture which allowed the deepened understanding and exploitation of the interaction between polymer donors and fullerene acceptors and thus has played a central role in performance advances.7–14 As a result, continuous improvements in the performance of single-junction organic cells are being made, highlighted by power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in excess of 10%.15–17 However, to improve the efficiency beyond the 10% limit a tandem structure is required, where a broader part of the spectrum of solar radiation is used and the thermalization loss of photon energy is minimized.18–20 A tandem solar cell usually consists of two individual subcells with complementary absorption profiles which are connected together by a recombination layer. The open circuit voltage (Voc) of a tandem structure equals to the sum of those of the subcells while keeping the short circuit current the same as the lower one, leading to an increased overall PCE. According to model calculations, maximum PCEs of up to 15% are feasible for polymer tandem solar cells with an optimized pair of absorber materials with different band-gap energies and complementary absorption spectra.21 Indeed, the synthesis of high-performance low-bandgap polymers has recently allowed us to overcome the major limiting factor for achieving high performance tandem solar cells and enabled the fabrication of such devices with certified PCEs up to 10.6%.22 Note that, triple-junction tandem cells having an open circuit voltage (Voc) of about 2.0 V and PCE values exceeding 11.5% have also been demonstrated recently.23–25
An important step towards the realization of higher efficiencies in OPV and tandem cells is engineering the driving force that achieves high quantum-efficiency extraction of electrons and holes to their respective electric contacts by inserting appropriate interfacial layers as charge-extracting constituents in OPVs and, also, as charge recombination layers in tandem devices.26–30 Inorganic interfacial layers have progressed rapidly in the past few years because of their superior electronic properties and adequate environmental stability compared to their organic counterparts. Among these, transition metal oxides (TMOs) possessing deep-lying energy levels and high work function (WF) have been widely proven to form good Ohmic contact with the indium tin oxide (ITO) anode and the donor polymer in the BHJ serving thus as excellent hole extraction layers (HELs) whereas they have also been successfully introduced into the interconnecting unit of a tandem cell providing a charge recombination contact with minimal resistive, optical, and energetic losses.21,31–33 However, in order to meet the requirements for large-scale and high-throughput production of organic photovoltaics, the recent development of TMO-based HELs and recombination layers has been focused on improving solution processing techniques. Note that, the fabrication of efficient all solution processed tandem polymer solar cells, in particular, remains a great challenge due to interfacial erosion/swelling usually caused by the solvent of the subsequent layer. At present, most of the solution-processed TMOs are synthesized via the sol–gel route, which usually requires high temperature post annealing (300–600 °C) to obtain films with high crystallinity in order to exhibit higher mobility than the less crystalline ones which is beneficial for charge transport. However, such high temperatures are incompatible with the high-throughput manufacturing protocols for OPVs and, hence, the research focus in this field has shifted to developing low-temperature processed TMO-based HELs, such as molybdenum oxide (MoOx),34–36 tungsten oxide (WOx),37–39 nickel oxide (NiOx),40–42 vanadium oxide (VOx),43–45 and, recently, cuprous oxide (CuOx)46 and chromium oxide (CrOx).47 Despite the different materials, in most cases a post annealing treatment is nevertheless still deemed necessary in order to obtain films with high quality. Hence, it remains a great challenge to synthesize solution-processed TMO layers suitable for OPV technology without any requirement for post deposition annealing treatment.
Polyoxometalates (POMs), on the other hand, are a large family of water-soluble fully inorganic early-transition metal–oxygen–anion clusters with fairly rigid cage like structures synthesized by a conventional and soft synthesis method which exhibit outstanding versatility in research fields including catalysis, energy conversion and molecular electronics.48–56 In view of POM clusters never been explored as charge transport components in OPV devices, our group has previously devoted the first efforts to investigate the influence of using the Keggin phosphotungstic acid (H3PW12O40) as an electron injection/extraction layer in OLED/OPV devices where the enhanced efficiency was attributed to the energy level alignment at the cathode electrode.57,58 Recently, Jia et al. used a similar Keggin POM (the H3PMo12O40) to improve hole extraction in devices with forward architecture,59 whereas Alaaeddine et al. introduced the use of the Dawson K6[P2W18O62] as an efficient HEL in conventional structured OPVs.60 However, the question whether other members of the plethora of POM clusters may find application in organic optoelectronics and under what conditions has remained elusive. We report here on the preparation of crystalline layers consisting of POMs spin coated from a methanol solution without any requirements for post deposition annealing treatment for application in OPVs and polymer tandem solar cells. We selected the previously studied members of the Keggin series, in particular H3PW12O40 (termed hereafter as PW-POM 12) and H3PMo12O40 (termed hereafter as PMo-POM 12) and compared them with their Dawson counterparts (NH4)6P2W18O62 (termed hereafter as P2W-POM 18) and (NH4)6P2Mo18O62 (termed hereafter as P2Mo-POM 18), respectively. We found that all these materials exhibit a nearly similar extremely high work function (WF) of 6.0–6.2 eV but differ on the position of their lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), which is heavily dependent on the type of the cluster (e.g., Keggin or Dawson) and the addenda atoms and can be effectively used for controlling the characteristics of optoelectronic devices. It is observed that all POMs and especially those having a deep LUMO level lying below the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor polymer are highly beneficial for device operation when used as HELs in OPVs. This was attributed to interfacial p-doping of the polymer donor which is caused by an electron transfer reaction involving the polymer donor and the low LUMO POMs and allows the beneficial tuning of the energetic and electronic properties of the polymer. In addition, their high degree of crystallinity is beneficial for charge transport while their extremely high WF allows a favorable energy level alignment at the anode/POM interfaces. Polymer solar cells with the conventional architecture based on the poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):[6,6]-phenyl C71butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) system using POMs as HELs exhibit excellent characteristics with a PCE of up to 4.3% in the case of the P2Mo-POM 18 incorporating device. Most importantly, the effectiveness of their unique functionality also extends to OPV devices with reverse architecture and different combination of donor:acceptor materials used in the active layer, such as blends of P3HT with the 1′,1′′,4′,4′′-tetrahydro-di [1,4]methanonaphthaleno[5,6]fullerene-C60 (IC60BA) acceptor (PCE of up to 6.7%) or blends of the low bandgap poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl) carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7) donor with PC71BM (PCE of up to 7.9%). Furthermore, using P3HT:IC60BA and PTB7:PC71BM as the active components in the two subcells and P2Mo-POM18/ZnO as the interconnecting element a high PCE of up to 9.9% was achieved in an inverted all solution-processed polymer tandem cell. The efficiency of our tandem cell is among the best reported values for double-junction polymer cells and is mainly a result of the high Voc value of 1.59 V measured in the tandem cell which is almost equal to the sum of the Voc of single junction cells, indicating the effectiveness of the interconnection layer. Based on these experimental results, we believe that polyoxometalates could be an ideal choice for the formulation of films used to facilitate hole extraction and charge recombination in organic photovoltaics and tandem cells since they: (1) have appropriate energy levels, such as a high WF and a LUMO located near or below the HOMO of most polymer donors, thus allowing favorable interfacial energy level alignment and p-type doping of the polymer, (2) are water soluble materials forming high-quality and sufficiently crystalline films without the need for post-deposition annealing, (3) are fully inorganic molecular metal oxides with outstanding environmental stability, and (4) are obtained via soft synthetic routes. The first two points are of particular interest and constitute the main theme of the present study.
2. Results and discussion
In general, polyoxometalates are complex anion clusters consisting of three or more transition metal oxyanions linked together by shared oxygen atoms to form a large, closed 3-dimensional framework.61 The metal atoms are usually group 5 (V) or group 6 (VI) transition metals in their higher oxidation states. Examples include vanadium (V), niobium (V), tantalum(V), molybdenum (VI), and tungsten (VI). The framework of transition metal oxyanions may enclose one or more hetero atoms such as phosphorus or silicon, themselves sharing neighboring oxygen atoms with the framework. In Fig. 1a the typical structural types of the POM anion clusters used in this study are shown, which are the Keggin (XM12O40m− where X = P and M = Mo, W) and Dawson (X2M18O62n− where X = P and M = Mo, W). The Keggin structure can be viewed as a cube formed by a XO4m− tetrahedron encapsulated into a neutral M12O36 sphere based on corner sharing MO5 square-pyramids whose apical oxygen atoms point outside the sphere. The edge-to-edge distance of the unit cube is about 1.2 nm.61 The Dawson structure on the other hand can be considered as an assembly of two Keggin units. We first investigated the morphology of POM layers which is critical to the solar cell performance using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. Fig. 2a shows the cross-sectional-view SEM image of a glass/ITO/P2Mo-POM 18 film while Fig. 2b depicts the 3-D AFM topography of the same film deposited via spin-coating on an ITO substrate (which is the most common transparent anode electrode in organic optoelectronic devices) from a methanol solution with a concentration of 60 mg mL−1 without any annealing treatment. (Note that the images presented in Fig. 2a and b are representative of the four POMs studied here which exhibit very similar morphologies, as shown in Fig. S1, ESI.†) From Fig. 2a it becomes evident that the POM layer can be readily distinguished with a thickness of ∼60 nm and exhibits adequate coverage on the ITO surface which is necessary for efficient device operation. The AFM image of the same film shown in Fig. 2b also revealed a uniform layer of high-quality exhibiting neither cracks nor pinholes with an RMS roughness of about 3.2 nm. In Fig. 2c the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the P2Mo-POM 18 material, obtained by slow evaporation of the equilibrium methanol solution, is shown. Taking into account the size of the POM cluster (∼1.2 × 2.4 nm)61 we conclude that the material is molecularly dispersed within its solution without forming any aggregated structures. The formation of highly compact and uniform films may be the result of the preservation of the molecular identity of the POMs when dissolved in a polar solvent like methanol. Next, in order to obtain information on the crystalline structure of the annealing-free POM layers, we analyzed their X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, shown in Fig. 2d and Fig. S2 (ESI†). The XRD measurements revealed that the polyoxometalate films are of high crystallinity exhibiting strong and narrow prominent diffraction peaks with the most pronounced scattering angles at ∼8.80°, 17.40°, 26.30°, 27.90°, 32.90° and 36.00° corresponding to distances 10.03 Å, 5.09 Å, 3.38 Å, 3.19 Å 2.72 Å and 2.49 Å. These distances can be assigned to metal–metal distances in the crystal of the material, in which the metal atoms are situated on the edges of a cube of size 1.2 nm, and to Mo–O interactions.62 Our results suggest a close resemblance of the anion structure in solutions and in pure crystals.63 Consequently, POM films are compact, uniform and highly crystalline – although they were not subjected to any post deposition annealing treatment – which constitute essential properties of a charge transport layer used in applications such as energy conversion devices. In addition, those films were found to be highly transparent in the visible region of the solar spectrum (as revealed from their transmittance spectra, Fig. S3, ESI†) which is also a highly desirable characteristic for solar-cell devices because it preserves the incoming photons for the neighboring absorber layer.

Next, in order to evaluate the ability of POMs to serve as HELs in BHJ OPVs we initially fabricated devices with the conventional structure ITO/POM/P3HT:PC71BM (120 nm)/ZnO (40 nm)/Al (OPV 1), where the widely studied P3HT:PC71BM was used as the photoactive blend. To facilitate electron extraction a solution-processed ZnO layer was deposited on top of the photoactive layer following a previously reported preparation procedure.64,65 The cell configuration and the chemical structures of P3HT, used as the polymer donor, and of PC71BM, used as the acceptor in the photoactive blend, are presented in Fig. 1b. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics under simulated 1.5 AM solar irradiation observed in our POM embedding devices are shown in Fig. 3a while Table 1 summarizes the operational characteristics and standard deviations of the devices. A reference device based on the commonly used hole transport layer, poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS),66,67 was also fabricated for comparison reasons. Note that the thickness dependence study presented in Fig. S4 (ESI†) revealed that devices using POMs as HELs having a thickness in the range of 20–80 nm performed better when compared to the reference device with the PEDOT-PSS layer revealing a large process window of our POMs. The optimized thickness for achieving better device performance was ∼40–60 nm. Results taken on these devices and that of the reference are presented in Table 1 where it becomes evident that the devices using POM films as HELs show significant improvement in their performance in comparison with the reference device which exhibits a PCE of 3.1%. The PCE of the POM-based devices is clearly enhanced to 3.9% for the device with the previously studied PW-POM 12 whereas it exhibits a high value of 4.1% for the devices with PMo-POM 12 and the P2W-POM 18 and a record value of 4.3% for the device with P2Mo-POM 18 as the HEL. In all cases the efficiency enhancement is a direct result of highly improved short-circuit current (Jsc) and also open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) in our POM incorporating devices. Note that series and shunt resistance deduced from the Jphoto–V curves were also found to be significantly improved (Table 1) indicating the formation of a better anode contact (i.e. lower interfacial resistance and reduced leakage, recombination, current) in the POM incorporating devices. Furthermore, the large enhancement of Jsc is also reflected in the considerable enhancement of the external quantum efficiency (EQE) values which were recorded in the POM modified devices and especially in those with the PMo-POM 12 and the two Dawson POMs (Fig. 3b) where EQEs of the order of 76% (in the wavelength region between 460 and 553 nm) were achieved, compared with the 55% of the reference device. This enhancement in EQEs suggests that the photon-to-electron conversion processes are very efficient in the POM modified devices. However, the absorption intensities of the P3HT:PC71BM films spin-coated on top of the POM layers do not follow the trend exhibited by the EQEs of the corresponding OPVs, since all films show identical absorption intensities (Fig. S5, ESI†) arising from their similar nano-morphology, as revealed from grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements taken on as cast P3HT:PC71BM films deposited onto different layers (on POMs and on PEDOT-PSS) (Fig. S6, ESI†).68 The improved EQE spectra provide thus clear evidence that charge carrier extraction is significantly reinforced in the POM-based devices. In addition, apart from high efficiency, long-term device stability was also achieved in OPV devices incorporating POM HELs compared with the reference device, as shown in Fig. 3c–f where the variation of PCE, Jsc, Voc and FF of the devices is presented as a function of storage time under ambient conditions. A fast drop in operational characteristics of the reference device with the PEDOT:PSS layer was observed, resulting in a nearly zero current after 400 hours. The fast degradation of devices based on PEDOT:PSS hole extraction layers has generally been reported by several groups,69,70 and it is attributed to the highly acidic nature of the PSS component. In contrast, all the devices embedding the POM layers exhibit good device stability and their PCEs can maintain approximately >70% of their original values, even after storage in air for 1300 hours. We argue that the incorporation of those completely inorganic molecular oxides at the anode/organic interface may prevent the diffusion of moisture and oxygen into the BHJ layer, whereas their increased crystallinity also helps to retard oxygen diffusion into the BHJ layer, thereby enhancing the device stability. The slower degradation rate of the POM-modified solar cells is an additional benefit of their use as efficient charge transport and also protective layers. It is expected that the device stability and lifetime could be further improved by the use of some more advanced encapsulation technologies for organic solar cells. Note that, except for the durability of the P3HT:PC71BM-based cells, the stability of pristine POM layers to ambient air and upon heating was also studied using UV-vis absorption measurements. It was found that POM films exhibit adequate stability when either post annealed at temperatures up to 210 °C (Fig. S7, ESI†) or stored under ambient conditions for several months (spectra not shown for brevity reasons).

To gain more insight into the enhanced device performance when POMs are used as HELs and to also explain the highest efficiencies achieved with the PMo-POM 12 and the two Dawson POMs we investigated the electronic structure of POMs by using data obtained through ultra-violet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) measurements. The UPS spectra of 10 nm thick POM layers deposited on ITO substrates are shown in Fig. 4a–d, respectively; on the left part of each figure the secondary electron cut-off region is presented whereas on the right part an expanded view of the valence band region is shown. The work function (WF) of each sample surface can be directly obtained by measuring the secondary electron cut-off of the photoemission spectra (on the left part of the spectra) which gives a WF value between 6.0 eV and 6.2 eV, depending on the shell cluster. By adding the BE of the onset of the band of occupied orbitals (also called as the oxo band) the ionization energy (IE) of each POM was estimated (having values between 8.1 and 8.3 eV) which gives the position of their HOMO with respect to the vacuum level. The energy levels of each POM layer were estimated according to these measurements (Fig. S8, ESI†) which reveal the n-type character of the materials under study. Finally, the WF and IE energies of P3HT (used as the donor polymer in our devices) were also measured using the UPS spectra shown in Fig. 4e and f, respectively (and found to be 4.4 eV and 5.2 eV, respectively). Accordingly, an energy level alignment scheme prior to contact of the POMs studied here and the P3HT donor polymer is presented in Fig. 5a and b. The position of the LUMO level of each POM material and P3HT was derived by taking into account the HOMO–LUMO energy differences (optical energy gap estimated by the onset of absorption measurements taken on as cast POM films, Fig. S7, ESI†). It is well known that the behavior of a semiconductor junction depends crucially on the alignment of the energy bands at the interface. According to our UPS results the POM/P3HT semiconductor interfaces can be divided into two types of heterojunctions: the PW-POM 12/P3HT interface (Fig. 5a) and the other POMs/P3HT interfaces (Fig. 5b). In the former case the LUMO level of PW-POM 12 is above the HOMO of P3HT whereas in the case of other POMs their LUMOs are located near or below the HOMO of P3HT which may cause the transfer of one or more electrons (especially in the case of the P2Mo-POM 18 with the lowest lying LUMO) from the HOMO of P3HT to the LUMO of POMs. This electron (electrons) transfer is energetically favoured and results in p-type doping of the polymer at its interface with POMs. Consequently, a hole is expected to be generated in the HOMO of P3HT through such a process, which then participates in the charge transport and results in an increase in conductivity.71,72 In addition, p-type doping of the polymer donor at its interfaces with POMs is expected to influence beneficially the energy level alignment after contact. In Fig. 5c the energy level alignment after contact of ITO/POM/P3HT materials is presented for the three POMs expecting to cause p-type doping of P3HT. The WF of pre-cleaned and plasma treated ITO substrates was derived from the UPS cut-off spectrum shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). It is obvious that a large favourable interfacial dipole is formed at the ITO/POM interfaces (as derived from the estimated WF values of all POM materials) which is highly beneficial for enhanced hole extraction at the interface of interest. However, in the PW-POM 12/P3HT interface a significant energy barrier of 0.8 eV (the energy difference between the HOMO of P3HT and the Fermi level) reduces the hole extraction rate towards the device Fermi level. The interfacial p-type doping of P3HT caused by the other POM materials is however expected to significantly lower (or even eliminate) this hole extraction barrier due to a HOMO level shift towards the Fermi level after doping, as illustrated in Fig. 5c. Such HOMO level shift was verified by UPS measurements of ultrathin P3HT films (about 3 nm) spin-coated on top of the different POM layers (Fig. S10, ESI†). A rigid shift of the near HOMO features of the UPS spectra towards lower binding energies was observed in the case of deposition of P3HT on top of the POMs introduced herein and, especially, on P2Mo-POM 18 exhibiting the lowest LUMO level, indicating the effective interfacial p-type doping of the polymer donor in the latter case. Due to the elimination of the energy barrier at the P3HT/POM interface caused by doping, holes effectively reach the Fermi level and then transport towards the ITO electrode via the LUMO level of POM (it is unlikely that holes are extracted and then transported through the deep lying HOMO level of POMs due to the large energy barrier). Note that the n-type character of POMs justifies the transport of holes through their LUMO and is in agreement with transport mechanisms via the conduction band proposed for other n-type TMOs, such as molybdenum and tungsten oxides.20

Capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements were also performed in devices having the structure glass/ITO/POM (60 nm)/P3HT:PC71BM (120 nm)/Al to investigate the charge carrier concentration. In general, C–V measurements in devices based on organic semiconductors usually exhibit Mott–Schottky characteristics and can be used to obtain the doping density (NA) and the device built-in voltage (Vbi).73 This is because there are no mobile carriers close to the contact in the semiconductor region (the so-called depletion or space-charge region) because they were moved across the interface to provide an equilibrium uniform Fermi level right after the contact of materials. Thus, the charge in the space charge region is entirely due to dopant atoms or molecules. By modulating the width w of the space charge region by changing the applied DC bias, the capacitance: (1)of the space charge region is modulated as well. Here, ε0 is the dielectric constant of vacuum, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the doped semiconductor (usually of the order 3.5), and A is the device area. Thus, the so-called Mott–Schottky plot of C−2versus applied DC voltage: (2)where ε = εrε0 and NA is the doping density, yields a straight line, whose slope yields the doping density and whose extrapolated intersection with the voltage axis yields the built-in voltage.74 In Fig. 6a and b, the C–V measurements and the Mott–Schottky characteristics (C−2–V), respectively, of our devices are shown. From Fig. 6b, it can be deduced that devices fabricated on the PMo-POM 12 and the Dawson POMs exhibit higher carrier concentration, which is consistent with the p-type doping of the organic semiconductor (P3HT) discussed above. Moreover, a higher Vbi compared with their counterparts bearing PEDOT-PSS and PW-POM 12 is observed in those devices. This increase in Vbi matches also with the increase in the measured Voc of the corresponding OPV devices (Table 1). Regarding the origin of the built-in voltage, it is assumed to be equal to:75 (3)where IE is the ionization energy of the organic semiconductor, WF is the work function of the contact and ΦH refers to the hole extraction barrier or, equivalently, to the energy difference between the HOMO of P3HT and the Fermi level. Reduction of ΦH due to the shift of the HOMO level of P3HT towards EF in the devices with the POMs (except of the PW-POM 12) thus causes an increase in the device built-in potential and, consequently, in the achieved Voc.

(f) Variation of the conductance versus frequency as derived from impedance spectroscopy measurements in OPV1 devices. 
Moreover, doping is known to cause increased ground-state carrier density and filling of localized states.76,77 The presence of localized band-tail states is well documented in organic semiconductors, and current flow in disordered semiconductors is generally described in terms of a transport energy that separates mobile states and localized band-tail states.78,79Fig. 6c shows the density of states with exponential band tails (by assuming a Gaussian distribution of the HOMO and LUMO states. Note that a broader exponential band tail on the HOMO and a narrower band tail on the LUMO is considered the usual situation in most organic solids78). There are two main recombination transitions to consider: between mobile states at or above the transport energy (transition (1) in Fig. 6c), between a mobile state and a localized band-tail state (transition (2)).80,81 Filling of the HOMO tail states via p-type doping of the polymer reduces the recombination losses (reduces transitions 2). To confirm that the charge carriers via doping from POM materials fill the low energy states of P3HT we conducted steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurements, shown in Fig. 6d. It is observed that the PL peak position is clearly red shifted and also broadened in the case of PMo-POM 12 and the Dawson POM underlayers which is an indication of filling (blocking) of the low energy trap states of the HOMO tail of P3HT which allows the degree of transitions (1) between higher energy mobile states to be increased.
Another common observation in p-doped organic semiconductors is also a significant increase in film conductivity and carrier mobility. In Fig. 6e the J–V characteristics of hole-only devices (ITO/POM (60 nm)/P3HT:PC71BM (120 nm)/MoOx (20 nm)/Ag), for the different HELs studied here, are shown. The electron current in these devices is completely suppressed by inserting the MoOx interlayer.82 It is observed that the current density in the devices can be manipulated within a range of two orders of magnitude by changing the HEL. We have analyzed our hole-only devices using a space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model to fit the experimental results. Hole-only currents in disordered organic semiconductors are commonly modeled using analogues of Child's law,83,84 which describes single carrier currents in a trap-free insulator and predicts that the current density (J) varies by the square of the applied bias (V) and inversely by the cube of the film thickness (L) according to eqn (4): (4)where εr is the dielectric permittivity and μh is the hole mobility of the active layer. Note that to include the electric field dependency of the mobility, eqn (4) can be appropriately modified according to the Mott–Gurney law (eqn (5)): (5)where  (Poole–Frenkel mobility law), μh,0 is the zero-field mobility, and β is the field activation factor of the mobility. From Fig. 6e, the calculated hole mobility is enhanced in devices with the POM layers. The calculated hole mobilities were 3.92 × 10−5 and 1.76 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the devices with the PEDOT-PSS and PW-POM 12 interlayers, respectively. These values increased to 3.97 × 10−4 and 4.02 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the devices using the PMo-POM 12 and P2W-POM 18 interlayers, respectively, and even further to 6.12 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the device with P2Mo-POM 18. Note that, the formation of a better contact at the anode interface for the devices with the POM interlayers can also be observed at low voltages. Furthermore, impedance spectroscopy was used to measure the bulk conductivity of the samples. All of our devices fitted well to the Rp–Cp (resistor–capacitor in parallel) model wherein the conductance (G = 1/Rp) should be independent of the frequency and the susceptance [B = j(2πfCp)] should vary linearly with frequency. The conductance data derived with this method is shown in Fig. 6f. It is evident that the conductance of the devices based on the POM HELs (especially of those possessing low LUMO levels) is much higher than that of the PEDOT-PSS bearing device. This may be the synergistic result of the enhanced conductivity of the active layer when deposited on POM layers and the high conductance of the crystalline POM films.
Based on all the above experimental evidence we conclude that significant gains in the cell efficiency when using the low lying LUMO POMs can be achieved. A reasonable question however is whether these materials are appropriate for use as charge transport layers in devices with diverse geometries and various donor:acceptror combinations in the photoactive blend. To demonstrate the universality of using POM HELs in OPV cells, we also fabricated inverted OPV devices with the structure FTO/ZnO (40 nm)/photoactive blend/POM (50 nm)/Ag where the photoactive blend was either P3HT:IC60BA (1:1% wt ratio) (OPV 2) or PTB7:PC71BM (1:1.5% wt ratio) (OPV 3). The selection of IC60BA as the acceptor in the blend of OPV 2 was because its fullerene core has high electron mobility and strong electron affinity, while indene substitution upshifts the LUMO energy level to −3.7 eV.85,86 The higher LUMO level (compared with the −3.9 eV of the PC71BM) results in higher Voc. The selection of PTB7 was because it exhibits a relatively small bandgap (1.85 eV)87 and, consequently, has superior potential for application in OPVs via harvesting the higher energy photons of the solar spectrum. In addition, this polymer exhibits a HOMO level located at −5.1 eV,87 which is higher than those of the PMo-POM 12 and the two Dawson POMs studied here and could thus have been p-type doped at its interface with those POMs. However, compared to normal (conventional) configuration cells, the challenge in making a solution-processed inverted cell is establishing a robust procedure for depositing the HEL on top of the active layer. Especially, for a polar and hydrophobic active layer, such as P3HT:IC60BA, dewetting results in incomplete or poor film formation. This problem was effectively solved by subjecting the active layer to an intense methanol treatment (several spin-coatings of methanol on its surface) which allowed the formation of continuous 50 nm thick POM films on P3HT:IC60BA layers (Fig. S11, ESI†). Fig. 7a shows the J–V characteristic curves taken under 1.5 AM simulated solar irradiation of the OPV 2 with an active layer thickness of 160 nm using different POM as HELs, while results are summarized in Table 2. The device with the PW-POM 12 layer shows a PCE of 5.9% those with PMo-POM 12 and P2W-POM 18 exhibit a higher PCE of about 6.5% whereas the devices with P2Mo-POM 18 exhibit even higher efficiency reaching a value of 6.7% as a result of an increased Jsc up to 10.50 mA cm−2. Note that, the large variation in the device efficiency when using the different POM layers excludes the possibility that the enhancement in the performance of our cells is a pure solvent effect.88 The same trend in the enhancement of device performance when using different POMs is also seen in OPV 3 devices (based on the PTB7:PC71BM photoactive layer with a thickness of 90 nm) where a consistently high efficiency is again obtained in the cells using the low lying LUMO POMs to facilitate hole extraction. The PCE reaches a high value of 7.0% in the device with the P2Mo-POM 18 layer, where an extremely high value for Jsc is measured (15.0 mA cm−2).

Having established reproducible procedures for making efficient inverted single junction wide and small band gap cells, the construction of polymer tandem cells was considered. The sub-cells consisted of the blends P3HT:IC60BA and PTB7:PC71BM as active layers. In a tandem solar cell, except for the selection of appropriate materials for the fabrication of efficient subcells, interconnecting layers (ICLs) are highly critical components for realizing high device performance. They generally consist of a p-type hole transporting layer (HTL) and an n-type electron transporting layer (ETL) which function as the charge recombination layer and simultaneously serve to shift the vacuum level. The latter is driven by the alignment of Fermi levels of the HTL and ETL. An ideal ICL must have high optical transmittance to minimize absorption losses, possess an energy level matching with those of donor and acceptor molecules in the active layers in order to efficiently collect holes from one subcell and electrons from the other subcell, a sufficient electrical contact between the ETL and the HTL within the ICL to enable efficient recombination of the holes and electrons extracted from each sub cell, and satisfactory impermeability to protect the underlying layers of the bottom cell from dissolution by the processing solvents for the top cell.89–91 Our experimental evidence suggests that POM materials studied here exhibit most of the above required properties for the HTL of the interconnecting unit of the tandem cell. We thus fabricated tandem devices using a P2Mo-POM 18/ZnO double layer to create the intermediate recombination contact (Fig. 1d). The ZnO nanoparticle layer was deposited from isopropanol on top of the P2Mo-POM 18 layer. UV-vis absorption measurements verified that isopropanol does not wash away the previously deposited POM layer. The P3HT:IC60BA blend used as the photoactive layer of the front (bottom) sub-cell exhibits a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) in shorter wavelengths (it showed high quantum efficiency in the range of 350–650 nm with a maximum EQE of up to 76% at 520 nm) whereas the PTB7:PC71BM blend (used in the back subcell) also exhibits a high EQE (up to 78% at 630 nm) which extends to 800 nm. The EQEs of the single-junction front and back cells are shown in Fig. 7c. In this design, a photon energy hν greater than the bandgap of P3HT would be absorbed first by the front subcell, leaving lower-energy photons to be harvested by the back subcell. The excess thermalization energy of charge carriers would, therefore, be utilized more efficiently in this tandem cell resulting in a higher theoretical efficiency limit relative to those of single-junction cells.92 In Fig. 7c the EQE measurements for each subcell of the fabricated tandem solar cell were next performed. We employed monochromatic light to selectively turn on one of the subcells as a photoconductor to conduct accurate EQE measurements for the other subcell, for which the results are also shown in Fig. 7c. It is found that the EQE of the front subcell remained nearly unaffected in the tandem device whereas the EQE of the back subcell decreased compared with that of the reference subcell in the region of 400 to 550 nm, explaining that the front cell has almost fully absorbed the incident light in this region. The J–V characteristic of the tandem cell with a 160 nm front cell and a 90 nm back cell under 1.5 AM illumination shown in Fig. 7d (where the J–V curves of the sub-cells are also shown for comparison reasons) exhibits a Voc of 1.59 V, a Jsc of 9.05 mA cm−2, a FF of 69.0%, while the PCE is 9.9% over 27 nominally identical devices. The high value of PCE in the tandem cell – which is among the best reported values for all solution processed double-junction polymer cells – was a result of the high values of Voc, which is almost equal to the sum of the Vocs of the sub-cells, and FF the tandem structure, which in turn indicate that the interconnecting has made an excellent electrical connection (also supported by the dark J–V characteristics of the individual subcells and the tandem device, Fig. S12, ESI†) to provide an efficient recombination region for holes and electrons generated from the front and back cell, respectively. The important role of POM in the P2Mo-POM 18/ZnO recombination unit can be seen in Fig. 7e, where the energy level diagram of the double-junction cell is shown in which the organic bulk heterojunctions and the POM layers are represented by HOMO and LUMO energy, the ZnO is noted by its conduction and valence band (the energy levels of the ZnO layer were derived from its UPS spectrum, Fig. S13 ESI,† and absorption measurements, not shown) and the metal contacts are noted by their WF. It is observed that the P2Mo-POM 18 layer, which possesses a LUMO level of 5.6 eV which is close to the HOMO energy levels of P3HT and PTB7, can form a hole extracted contact that allows the extraction/transport of hole carrier at a negligible energy barrier (as discussed above). On the other hand, ZnO, with a conduction band minimum of 4.0 eV, close to the LUMO levels of IC60BA and PC71BM, functions as the electron transporting layer. In combination, the P2Mo-POM 18/ZnO double layer functions as a charge recombination junction for opposite charge carriers from adjacent subcells. This double layer possesses a high WF on its one side and a low WF on its other side resulting in a high downward vacuum level (VL) shift towards the ZnO side. Such a shift can be accomplished probably via the spontaneous electron transfer from the conduction band and/or the trap states (which are always present within the material) of ZnO to the LUMO (and/or upper LUMOs) of the POM material resulting in the formation of a large interfacial dipole, as illustrated in Fig. S14 (ESI†). Due to the shift of the VL the LUMO of POM, through which holes are extracted from the front subcell, and the conduction band minimum of ZnO, where electrons are extracted from the back subcell, approach together and, consequently, holes and electrons recombine with minimum energy losses as evidenced by the high Voc and overall performance of the tandem cell. Consequently, the design approach for the interconnection unit proposed here allowed us to realize a fully solution processable and highly efficient polymer tandem cell. More importantly, the universal compatibility of a POM material which was successfully incorporated into such a tandem design (and also in single-junction devices shown above) was demonstrated. We believe that by adopting polymers with better matched absorption spectra and the low lying LUMO, highly crystalline POM HELs/recombination layers introduced here, tandem solar cells with PCEs exceeding 10% can effectively be realized.
3. Conclusions
Polyoxometalates (POMs) have taken a very important place in organic photovoltaics technology. In particular, two members of the Keggin series, in particular H3PW12O40 and H3PMo12O40 and their Dawson counterparts (NH4)6P2W18O62 and (NH4)6P2Mo18O62, are successfully implemented as hole extraction layers in single-junction polymer cells with different configurations and active layers and, also, as recombination layers in the interconnecting unit of a tandem cell with a reverse structure. The successful use of POMs as the hole extraction layers and as effective components of the interconnection unit reflects a fundamental physical mechanism, which can be simply summarized as: ITO/POM/polymer interfaces can effectively allow negligible barrier hole extraction and enhanced hole transport rates because of their high WF, their p-type doping ability – especially of those with the low lying LUMO levels – and their increased degree of crystallinity. Most importantly, their unique functionality can be obtained via solution processing and without any requirement for post annealing treatment. Taking into account the very recent developments of liquid processing routes, it can be expected that the powerful properties of POMs presented here could make them accessible for large-scale and high-throughput production of organic photovoltaics. In the end, we believe that the approach presented here could be considered as a key-point in the development of POMs for application in energy harvesting devices in the next few years.
4. Experimental section
Preparation of POM materials
The Keggin POMs were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The Dawson POMs were prepared according to the literature.56 POM films were deposited via spin coating at 1000 rpm for 40 s from a methanol (MeOH, obtained from Sigma Aldrich) solution. The concentration of Keggin POMs was optimized at 50–60 mg mL−1 (for efficient device operation) while that of the Dawson POMs was 25–30 mg mL−1.
Device preparation
Devices with the conventional structure were fabricated on pre-cleaned and plasma treated ITO-coated glass substrates (2 × 2 cm2) with a sheet resistance 15 Ω square−1, which served as the anode electrode. The devices with the reverse structure were fabricated on pre-cleaned FTO substrates with a sheet resistance 2.5 Ω square−1. Substrates were ultrasonically cleaned with a standard solvent (15 min each in acetone and isopropanol). Devices were fabricated by spin-casting a POM layer from a methanol solution (conventional) or a ZnO layer consisting of nanoparticles dissolved in isopropanol (reverse), followed by the deposition of the active layer. The photoactive layer consisted of either P3HT:PC71BM (10 mg mL−1 for P3HT, 8 mg mL−1 for PC71BM) or P3HT:I60BA (10 mg mL−1 for P3HT, 10 mg mL−1 for PC71BM) or PTB7:PC71BM (10 mg mL−1 for PTB7, 15 mg mL−1 for PC71BM) blend in chlorobenzene (CB) solvent and it was spin-cast on top of the POM layer in conventional or the ZnO layer in reverse devices (note that in the case of PTB7:PC71BM 3% per volume of DIO was added in the solution). After spin coating, the photoactive layer was annealed either at 150 °C (P3HT:PC71BM, P3HT:IC60BA) or at 70 °C (PTB7:PC71BM) for 20 min in air. Next, the HTL or ETL was deposited via spin-coating. The devices were completed with a 150 nm thick aluminium or silver counter electrode. All these chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used with no further purification.
Measurements and instrumentation
The current density–voltage characteristics of the fabricated OPVs were measured using a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit. For the photo-current measurements devices were illuminated using a xenon lamp and an AM 1.5G filter to simulate solar light illumination conditions with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. To accurately define the active area of all devices we used aperture masks during the measurements with areas equal to those of the Al contacts (12.56 mm2). The measurements were performed in air and at room temperature. The thickness of the films was measured using an Ambios XP-2 profilometer and a M2000 Woolam ellipsometer, respectively. For the determination of valence band and work function of POMs, P3HT and ITO ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were performed using the He I (21.22 eV) excitation line. A negative bias of 12.28 V was applied to the samples during UPS measurements in order to separate the sample and analyzer high binding energy (BE) cut-offs and estimate the absolute work function value from the secondary BE cut-off region of the UPS spectra. The analyzer resolution is determined from the width of the Au Fermi edge to be 0.16 eV. The capacitance–voltage measurements were recorded on devices exhibiting the same architecture as that described above (OPVs) at a frequency of 100 kHz and an AC bias of 25 mV by using a Keithley 4200-SCS DC characterization system. The measurements were performed in air at room temperature. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out using the PGSTAT-30 potentiostat equipped with a frequency response analyzer (FRA) under 1 sun illumination at an applied potential close or at open-circuit. EQE measurements were carried out using an Autolab PGSTAT-30 potentiostat, with a 300 W Xe lamp in combination with an Oriel 1/8 monochromator for dispersing the light in an area of 0.5 cm2. A Thorlabs silicon photodiode was used for the calibration of the IPCE spectra. To measure EQE of individual subcells in the tandem structure, monochromatic light at 550 and 700 nm was used to excite the bottom (P3HT:IC60BA) and top (PTB7:PC71BM) subcells, respectively. The crystalline phase of films was investigated by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) (with a SIEMENS D500 diffractometer) using CuKα radiation. The measurements were performed using the following combinations of slits: 1.0°/1.0°/1.0° as aperture diaphragms, 0.15° as detector diaphragm and 0.25° as diffractor beam monochromatic diaphragm. The measured 2θ, ranging between 1° and 30°, was scanned in steps of 0.03°/5 s. The surface morphology and structure were investigated using an NT-MDT atomic force microscope (AFM) operated in tapping mode. Steady state photoluminescence (PL) was carried out using as an excitation source an Ar+-ion laser operating at 457.9 nm. The signal was analysed using a Jobin-Yvon spex HR-320 spectrometer and detected using a photomultiplier tube. The signal was corrected for the system response. Absorption and transmittance measurements were done using a Perkin Elmer Lampda 40 UV/vis spectrophotometer.

Broader context
The need to curb climate changes has become a matter of utmost urgency. In the attempt to reduce carbon emissions, solar cells have been touted as the ultimate green solution. As a clean and renewable energy source, solar cells can ease the strain on diminishing oil reserves. Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are among the faster-growing energy technologies of solar cells in the world today and a leading candidate for carbon-free electricity generation owing to their easy fabrication, low cost, solution processability and mechanical flexibility. However, the efficiencies of organic solar cells are still much lower than that of a commercialized solar cell. Therefore, effective techniques for improving the efficiencies of organic solar cells are urgently needed. Here, we report a novel technique for improving the efficiencies of organic solar cells by introducing a solution processed highly crystalline polyoxometalate layer without any post annealing requirements to serve as the hole transport/extraction element in OPV cells. We also find that the band structure of the polyoxometalate layer is critical to the efficiency enhancement because the energy levels of the molecular orbitals can influence p-type doping of the photoactive layer and the energy barrier for hole extraction. More importantly, polymer tandem cells using polyoxometalates as charge recombination layers are also demonstrated. The technique is convenient and cost effective since there are plenty of choices in using members of the large family of polyoxometalates and it paves a way for realizing high-performance organic solar cells in the near future.
