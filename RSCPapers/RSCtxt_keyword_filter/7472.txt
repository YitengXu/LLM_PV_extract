The photoanode achieved ∼1% higher power conversion efficiency compared to the electrode prepared by soaking in a solution containing multiple dyes.

Broader context
The flexible dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) has attracted great interest due to merits such as low-cost production. However, the efficiency of the flexible DSC is still quite low. One of the approaches to improve the solar energy conversion efficiency is to introduce multiple dyes to broaden the absorption spectrum. The traditional cocktail or mixed dyes approach has disadvantages of uncontrollable dye loading and electron loss due to intermolecular interactions between the dyes. Here we introduce a facile method to adsorb different dyes on discrete layers of mesoporous TiO2 to resolve these issues and show an overall enhancement in the IPCE.


Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have been widely investigated due to their low-cost and hence are a potential substitute for conventional Si based solar cells, which are still quite expensive.1–3 To achieve highly efficient DSCs, the dye sensitizing the cell needs to capture as much incident light as possible, both in intensity and breadth of wavelength. While the solar spectrum on the earth's surface covers a range of wavelengths, individual sensitizers can only absorb a relatively narrow range of the solar spectrum. Because the absorbance properties of the sensitizer limit the conversion of incident photons to electricity within a DSC, the efficiency of the DSC is still relatively low compared to silicon based solar cells. Normally, an additional scattering layer has been introduced to improve light harvesting.4,5 However, this method cannot broaden the absorption range, which is determined by the characteristics of the dye. Many sensitizers have been developed to extend the light absorption, such as black dyes, TH304 dye and quantum dots.6 Currently there is no single dye molecule that has strong absorption covering a wide range from visible to IR light.7 Hence dyes with different light absorption ranges have been mixed in an attempt to achieve broad range absorption.7–10 Burke et al. mixed two dyes in a solvent and dipped the working electrode in the mixed dye solution.10 The so-called cocktail-cell gave light absorption across the spectral range of the individual dyes. However, different dyes may have different uptake times, which becomes an issue if using the dye-cocktail approach. Attempts to sequentially dip an electrode into two different dye solutions resulted in competitive adsorption, with the adsorption of one dye causing desorption of the other dye.7 Another important issue is the interaction or electron/hole recombination between different dye molecules in close proximity, which would significantly compromise the electron injection into the TiO2 electrode, resulting in failure to achieve the synergistic effect of the multiple dyes.11

        TiO2 layers that could be separately dyed with different sensitizers and then integrated into a working electrode would be ideal, circumventing the above issues. However the requirement for high temperature sintering (>450 °C) during TiO2 electrode construction prevents the fabrication of pre-dyed multiple-layer electrodes due to degradation of organic dyes at elevated temperatures. Hayase et al. produced a dye-bilayer structure by limiting the adsorption of the first dye using a pressurized CO2 process followed by soaking in the second dye solution.12 Lee et al. have recently developed a technique mimicking the concept of the stationary phase and the mobile phase in column chromatography to selectively sensitize the TiO2 layers with different dyes.13 A significant improvement (about 30%) in cell efficiency was reported, but this process is quite complex involving multiple steps of adsorption and desorption of dyes. Here, we employ a simple process in which two TiO2 films were pre-dyed in two different dye solutions (dye-1 and dye-2) separately and then the dye-1 sensitized TiO2 layer was transferred onto the dye-2 sensitized TiO2 layer to achieve segregated layers of the two dyes. Such a process was carried out on plastic substrates for constructing flexible dye-sensitized solar cells. Compared to the glass based DSCs, plastic substrate based DSCs have many advantages, including light weight, easy handling and transport, more resilient to breakage, minimal thickness, flexibility, and low temperature sintering processes that save cost.14,15 These advantages make flexible DSCs attractive for commercialization if the multiple-dye approach can further improve their light harvesting ability and hence their efficiency.
Schematics of the so-called “stamping” method and the cocktail method for incorporation of multiple sensitizers are shown in Fig. 1. In the stamping process (Fig. 1a), mesoporous TiO2 beads of 830 ± 40 nm (SEM image shown in Fig. 2a), which were synthesized according to previous reports,16,17 were first dispersed in ethanol with a 25 wt% solid loading. The slurry was used to coat a layer on the indium tin oxide-coated polyethylene naphthalate substrate (ITO–PEN, Peccell Technologies, Inc., Japan) by a doctor-blade. The film was then pressed at 100 MPa for 3 min in a cold isostatic press (CIP), which applies a pressure in all directions through a pressurized liquid to the TiO2 film that is sealed in a flexible bag. Fig. 2b shows the SEM image of a cross-section of the film, which comprises closely packed submicrometre-sized beads. The film was soaked in the 0.3 mM N719 (B2, Dyesol) tert-butanol and acetonitrile (1:1, by volume) solution for 18 h. At the same time, a TiO2 layer was coated on the non-conductive side of another piece of the ITO–PEN, and then soaked in the 0.2 mM porphyrin GD318 ethanol solution for 2 h. After drying, the two dyed films were placed face-to-face and pressed in the isostatic press at 100 MPa for 3 min. Due to different adhesion properties between the TiO2 layers and the substrates (see ESI† for details), the TiO2 layer on the non-conductive side of the PEN film was transferred onto the TiO2 layer on the ITO side of the ITO–PEN. By this means, the flexible photoanode consisting of two distinct layers containing different dyes was prepared and labelled NG-Stamping. For comparison, another TiO2 photoanode with a similar film thickness was soaked in a mixed dye solution containing both N719 and GD3 (molar ratio of 1.5:1) for 18 h, Fig. 1b, and the sample was labelled NG-Cocktail.

Photographs of the films dyed with either N719 or GD3 before the stamping process are shown in Fig. 3a. The two films were placed face-to-face and pressed, causing the GD3 dyed film to be removed from its substrate and transferred on top of the N719 dyed film. Fig. 3b shows the bare PEN film remaining after the GD3 dyed TiO2 layer was transferred and a slightly darkened film on the right containing both the GD3 and N719 dyed layers after the CIP compression. The original size of the GD3 dyed TiO2 film (around 1.0 × 1.1 mm2) was smaller than the N719 dyed TiO2 film (around 1.2 × 1.5 mm2), thus the superimposition of the two layers does not fully overlap. The superimposed two TiO2 layer structure is clearly distinguishable by the different color contrast of the centre versus outer perimeter of the film shown in Fig. 3c. Hence the GD3 dyed film was successfully transferred onto the N719 dyed film, forming a photoanode consisting of two separate layers, each containing a different dye.

The photoanodes were assembled with a Pt-sputtered ITO–PEN film (Peccell Technologies, Inc., Japan) as the counter electrode into a solar cell to investigate photovoltaic performance. Full details of cell assembly and testing procedures are in the ESI†. Cells with a single layer of N719 and GD3 were also studied as references. Black metal with a circular aperture (4.5 mm in diameter) was put on top of the device during photovoltaic testing. During the stamping process, the two discrete layers with different dyes would form a tight connection under the pressure. The cross-section SEM image of the stamped electrode showed good connection between the two layers at the interface (Fig. S2, ESI†). To study any effect of the interface between the two TiO2 layers on the performance of the device, two electrodes of similar thickness were compared: NN-Stamping (made from two N719 sensitized layers via a stamping process) and NN (a single N719 sensitized film). Cells constructed from these electrodes showed similar photovoltaic performance, despite a slight difference in the photocurrent (shown in Table S1, ESI†). Hence, the stamping process should not impair the device performance as the particle connections between the TiO2 layers should be similar to those in the TiO2 layers due to the pressure applied during the stamping process.

UV-Vis
absorption spectra of the N719 and GD3 dye solutions (Fig. S3, ESI†) show that the N719 dye has two absorption peaks, around 390 nm and 530 nm, while the GD3 dye has three peaks, around 430 nm, 575 nm, and 625 nm. The combined absorption of these two dyes would give increased absorption over the broad spectral range of both dyes (as shown in Fig. S4, ESI†). In Fig. 4a, the IPCE spectra of the individual N719 and GD3 containing cells showed peaks in similar positions to the dyes in solution. The IPCE spectrum of the NG-Stamping cell shows good absorption across the broad spectral range. The 390 nm absorption peak of the N719 dye overlapped with the broad peak of GD3 at 430 nm, and the other peaks are clearly seen. Compared with the IPCE of the N719 cell, the NG-Stamping electrode had an increased IPCE across 350–800 nm, most significantly in the range of 400–500 nm and 550–700 nm, which would increase the photocurrent of the device. The NG-Stamping electrode had similar dye loading as the individual N719 electrode and GD3 electrode as shown in Table S2 (ESI†). As the light was shone through the photoanode side of the cell, the light was absorbed by the N719 layer first. The first layer (N719) in the NG-Stamping electrode does not absorb all the light, the remaining or filtered light then interacted with the second layer (GD3) thus producing more electrons compared with the single N719 electrode. Compared with the IPCE of the GD3 cell, the NG-Stamping electrode doubled the IPCE in the range of 500–550 nm, mainly due to the high IPCE of the N719 resulting in more electrons being produced. However, there was a decrease in the IPCE in the range of 400–500 nm. In this range the N719 dye has a much lower IPCE than the GD3 dye, resulting in a lower IPCE for the NG-Stamping electrode in the range of 400–500 nm than the GD3 electrode. For example, the N719 absorbed ∼75% of the 450 nm light (Fig. S4, ESI†) and produced an IPCE of 40% and the remaining 25% of 450 nm light absorbed by the GD3 would produce an IPCE of ∼16% (0.25 × 65%). Therefore, altogether the NG-Stamping produced an IPCE of ∼56% (40% + 16%), which is lower than that of the GD3 electrode (65%). Compared with the N719 electrode and GD3 electrode, the NG-Cocktail electrode showed an IPCE spectrum that was at some wavelengths lower and at other wavelengths higher. Between 450 and 500 nm, the NG-Cocktail IPCE was a little higher than that of the NG-Stamping electrode due to the filtering effect of the N719 in the NG-Stamping electrode as discussed above. Although the NG-Cocktail electrode had a slightly higher absorption than the NG-Stamping electrode (Fig. S4, ESI†), overall it showed a lower IPCE than the NG-Stamping electrode. The NG-Cocktail electrode contained more N719 than the NG-Stamping electrode, which should result in a higher IPCE for the NG-Cocktail electrode. However, there are recombinations due to intermolecular interactions between the dyes in the NG-Cocktail electrode as indicated in the fluorescence spectra (Fig. S5, ESI†) of the mixed dye solution. The fluorescence intensity of the N719 (Fig. S5a, ESI†) decreased to one third in the presence of GD3. This contributed to the decrease in the IPCE of the NG-Cocktail electrode.

The current–voltage (I–V) curves of the N719, GD3, NG-Stamping, and NG-Cocktail cells under 1 sun illumination are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), and their photovoltaic characteristics are listed in Table 1. Both the NG-Stamping and NG-Cocktail cells had a higher photocurrent (Jsc) than the N719 and GD3 cells, and a higher photovoltage (Voc) than the GD3 Cell, but a lower photovoltage than the N719 cell. The fill factors (FF) of the four cells were quite similar, with the NG-Stamping being a little higher. The higher photocurrent was the result of the increased absorption of light due to the dual-dye absorption. The NG-Stamping cell had the highest photocurrent, which was consistent with the IPCE results. For the NG-Cocktail device, as the two types of dye were distributed in the film randomly, the adjacent dye molecules of different energy status may cause electron/hole recombination events, and hence loss of electrons, as an oxidized dye molecule could capture an electron from the adjacent dye molecule that is in an excited state. This higher recombination rate between different dyes leads to a lower electron injection rate, resulting in a lower IPCE and lower current.

For cells containing two dyes, the photovoltage is approximately the average of the two single-dye cells:13 NG-average is calculated as 712 mV, while the NG-Cocktail has a slightly lower value (702 mV). This variation in the photovoltage is due to the charge recombination. In general, a longer electron lifetime means slower electron and I3− recombination rate, which normally gives a higher photovoltage.19 The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of the DSCs were employed to evaluate the effective electron lifetime (τeff), which can be calculated from the minimum frequency (ωmin) of the mid-frequency peak according to the following relation:20τeff ≈ 1/ωmin

Fig. 4b shows the Bode admittance originating from the EIS measurements of the four samples. From the Bode admittance, the τeff was calculated, as listed in Table 1. Clearly the double-dye devices have an electron lifetime between the GD3 and N719 devices, and the NG-Stamping cell had a longer electron lifetime than the NG-Cocktail cell. These results are consistent with the trends in photovoltage. The fluorescence of the mixed dye solution (Fig. S5, ESI†) showed the quenching effect between the two dye molecules. This same quenching in the NG-Cocktail device may account for the shorter electron lifetime compared to the NG-Stamping cell.
Considering the overall power conversion efficiency (PCE), although the NG-Cocktail cell had a higher PCE than the N719 and the GD3 cells, its PCE was around 1% lower than that of the NG-Stamping cell. The PCE of the NG-Stamping device is not simply the sum of the PCEs of the N719 and the GD3 cells. Assuming the first layer of the N719 sensitized electrode would consume more than 50% of the incident light between 400 and 700 nm, the second layer of the GD3 sensitized electrode could utilize only the remaining transmitted light and produce a PCE of ∼1.7% (0.5 × 3.4%). A sum of the two layers would thus give an overall efficiency value of 1.7% (the GD3 layer) + 3.2% (the N719 layer), which is approximately equal to the value of the NG-Stamping device. Hence, by the stamping process, the two dyes were successfully employed in one electrode with little loss of photon energy.
Conclusions
Two different dyes, N719 and GD3, have been adsorbed onto two separate layers of TiO2 on plastic substrates and then assembled into one electrodevia a “stamping” process. This electrode gave more intense absorption than the single N719 or GD3 electrode, and hence resulted in a much improved PCE of 4.9%. The stamping process gives more controlled dye loadings and discrete dye layers and hence has the advantage of less interaction between N719 and GD3 and therefore less electron loss compared to the cocktail (mixed dye) process. This stamping technique could be extended to produce devices consisting of multiple layers with multiple dyes. By careful choice of sensitizers, there is the potential to extend the light harvesting range of dye-sensitized solar cells to cover the full solar spectrum.
