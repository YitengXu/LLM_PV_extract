    , Accepted 7th March 2020First published on 7th March 2020AbstractThe minimization of the defects at grain boundaries and/or the film surface of organic–inorganic halide perovskites is becoming increasingly important to produce highly efficient and long-term stable perovskite solar cells (PeSCs). In this study, we present a promising strategy to enhance the performance and stability of PeSCs by using a thiazole-bridged diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based semiconducting polymer poly{3-(5-([2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-6-(thiazol-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione} (PTzDPPBTz) as the passivation layer. Our results indicate that a large number of Lewis base functional groups present in PTzDPPBTz can effectively passivate the defects and vacancies created by under-coordinated Pb atoms without significantly altering the microstructure of the perovskite film, enabling the perovskite film to exhibit superior stability while preserving its good optoelectronic properties. Meanwhile, the appropriate energy level of PTzDPPBTz can facilitate efficient charge transfer at the interface. With the PTzDPPBTz passivation layer, the devices deliver a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 20.30% (stabilized PCE = 20.39%) without photocurrent hysteresis, surpassing the efficiency of the devices without a passivation layer (PCE = 16.58%). Importantly, the PTzDPPBTz passivation layer can also be applicable for air-processed devices prepared at a high relative humidity level (72 ± 3%), delivering an almost comparable PCE (19.19%) to those obtained for the devices processed under an inert atmosphere. To the best of our knowledge, 19.19% represents the highest PCE ever reported for air-processed PeSCs prepared at relative humidity exceeding 70%. In addition, the feasibility of using a conjugated polymer-based passivation layer for monolithic all-perovskite tandem solar cells is first demonstrated, and a remarkably high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.87 V is attained, which is much higher than those of the tandem cells without passivation (1.76 V). More encouragingly, long-term stable devices are demonstrated by simply applying a UV-curable epoxy/poly[perfluoro(4-vinyloxy-1-butene)] (CYTOP) bilayer film as the encapsulation layer, retaining ≈65% of their initial PCE after 890 hours of continuous operation in ambient air. Our findings provide a new avenue to improve both the efficiency and stability of air-processed PeSCs via defect passivation.
Introduction
Solar cells based on organic–inorganic halide perovskite semiconductors have recently emerged as the most promising contenders for next-generation photovoltaic technologies primarily due to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and potentially cost-effective manufacturing.1–9 For achieving high efficiency and stable PeSCs, the development of high-quality defect-free perovskite films with optimal crystalline morphology as well as the optimization of contact properties between the perovskite layer and the electrodes is critical.1,4,6,8 Nevertheless, previous studies have reported that perovskites will easily lose methylammonium ions when exposed to heat or moisture, leading to the formation of under-coordinated Pb2+ vacancies at the grain boundaries as well as the film surface.10–12 These under-coordinated Pb2+ vacancies have been considered as the major sources of electronic trap states, which in turn cause nonradiative trap-assisted charge recombination and limit the ultimate device efficiency.10–12 In addition, the presence of methylammonium ions at the grain boundaries can accelerate the diffusion for moisture ingress, leading to rapid device degradation.13 To address the above-mentioned issues, a straightforward strategy is to incorporate organic molecules with electron-donating Lewis base functional groups (e.g. pyridine, thiazole, carbonyl, and amine) onto the perovskite surface to function as the passivation layer, which can eliminate the trap states of the perovskites via the formation of Lewis adducts between the positively charged under-coordinated Pb atoms and Lewis base functional groups.10,11 In particular, these organic passivation layers usually consist of hydrophobic functional groups to prevent moisture ingress into the perovskite layer. To date, most passivation layers are usually based on insulating molecules,11,14,15 which can often compromise the device performance. Therefore, precise control of film thickness to avoid unnecessary series resistance becomes essential. Generally, the optimal thickness of these passivation layers is relatively thin (<10 nm),14,15 making it difficult to ensure full-coverage of the passivation layer onto the rough perovskite surface. One way to circumvent this problem is the use of π-conjugated semiconducting molecules (including small molecules and polymers) bearing Lewis base function groups as the passivation layer.11,16–19 To effectively passivate the defects within the perovskite layer, various processing techniques have been developed. Generally, these π-conjugated semiconducting molecules are either added to the anti-solvent or the perovskite precursor solution.11,20–22 Due to the strong interaction between the molecules and the perovskite, the crystallization and optoelectronic properties of the perovskite layer can be altered.11,20–22 Compared with small molecules, polymers can provide superior film-forming properties and thus form relatively stable interactions with the perovskites. Semiconducting polymers, such as poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophe-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PBDB-T) and poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT), have been demonstrated to effectively passivate the defects in perovskites, thereby leading to advances in improving device performance and stability.18,19 Despite the foregoing achievements, the high photovoltaic efficiency reported so far is only obtained in lab-scale devices (active area <1 cm2).18,19 In addition, the resulting devices still exhibit obvious air-induced degradation.18,19 Currently, developing a promising defect passivation methodology for achieving high-efficient and long-term stable large-area PeSCs still appears to be a highly challenging task.
On the other hand, high-quality perovskite films are commonly prepared under an inert atmosphere to exclude environmental impacts such as moisture and oxygen.1,6,7,9 However, such fabrication procedures are time-consuming and hardly applicable to high-throughput large-area-capable manufacturing techniques. Previous studies have indicated that moisture is the main factor affecting perovskite film formation and thus the corresponding device efficiency.6,7,9,15 Several effective strategies to improve the performance of air-processed PeSCs have been proposed, with particular emphasis on developing novel perovskite materials with good moisture resistance and establishing new processing protocols for fabricating perovskite films.23–35 Currently, the devices with perovskite films processed at relatively low humidity levels (15–45%) can exhibit remarkable PCEs (up to 20.8%),25,28,31,34,35 while achieving a high PCE in the case of high humidity conditions (>70%) still remains highly challenging (PCE < 16%), as shown in Table S1 (ESI†). The maximum achievable efficiency of air-processed devices is generally inferior to those of the devices processed under an inert atmosphere, especially in the case of high humidity processing conditions. The above-mentioned vacancies and defect density within the perovskite layer are expected to be significantly increased upon air exposure, implying that the passivation layer is of particular importance for air-processed PeSCs. However, only very limited research efforts have so far been dedicated to this topic.36
In this study, for the first time, we demonstrate the feasibility of using a thiazole-bridged diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based semiconducting polymer poly{3-(5-([2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-6-(thiazol-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione} (PTzDPPBTz) as the passivation layer for PeSCs (see Fig. 1a for the chemical structure). Another polymer, poly(n-hexyl-1,4-diketo-3,6-diphenylpyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole) (PDPP; see Fig. 1a for the chemical structures), is used as the structural analogue to investigate the effects of the thiazole unit on the passivation of the perovskite layer. In contrast to PDPP, the strong interaction between a large amount of Lewis base functional groups present in PTzDPPBTz (e.g. thiazole and carbonyl) and the perovskite can effectively passivate the defects and vacancies created by under-coordinated Pb atoms (see Fig. 1a) without significantly altering the microstructure of the perovskite film, enabling the perovskite film to exhibit superior stability under ambient conditions while preserving its good optoelectronic properties. Meanwhile, PTzDPPBTz also possesses a suitable energy level, which can favor exciton dissociation and charge transfer at the perovskite/PTzDPPBTz interface. With the PTzDPPBTz passivation layer, the p–i–n type planar heterojunction device (see Fig. 1a for the device structure) delivers a decent PCE of 20.30%. A high PCE of up to 16.18% can be secured even when the active area is extended to 5.04 cm2. Importantly, the PTzDPPBTz passivation layer is also applicable for air-processed devices fabricated under high humidity level of 72 ± 3%, delivering a nearly comparable PCE (19.19%) to those obtained for the devices processed under an inert atmosphere. To the best of our knowledge, 19.19% represents the highest PCE ever reported for air-processed PeSCs fabricated at relative humidity beyond 70%. In addition, this strategy can be expanded to monolithic all-perovskite tandem solar cells, and an extraordinary high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.87 V is attained, which is much higher than those of the tandem cells without the passivation layer (1.76 V). It is worth noting that this is the first demonstration of highly efficient monolithic all-perovskite tandem solar cells through the incorporation of a π-conjugated polymer as the passivation layer. More significantly, long-term stability of the devices can be attained by simply using cost-efficient organic-based bilayer films consisting of UV-curable epoxy (40 μm) and a hydrophobic perfluorinated polymer poly[perfluoro(4-vinyloxy-1-butene)] (CYTOP; 25 μm) as the encapsulation layer, maintaining ≈65% of their initial efficiency after 890 hours of continuous operation in ambient air. This work provides a promising strategy for improving the performance and stability of PeSCs via defect passivation based on π-conjugated polymers.

Results and discussion
The high-quality methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) perovskite film was formed by employing an anti-solvent dripping strategy. Basically, during spin-coating of perovskite precursors, an ethyl acetate anti-solvent was dropped onto the precursor film to facilitate the nucleation and growth of the perovskite crystals, followed by casting DPP polymers from chloroform. The substrates were then transferred to a hotplate set within the same environment and annealed at 105 °C for 15 min. The pristine perovskite film (i.e. without the DPP polymer) exhibited impurity-free polycrystalline phases accompanied with excellent surface coverage, as shown in Fig. 1b and S1 (ESI†). However, such a film was highly susceptible to degradation in the ambient atmosphere (25 °C and 60–70% relative humidity in the air), as evidenced by the increased content of the PbI2 phase upon air exposure in X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (see asterisks in Fig. 1b). The air-induced degradation in pristine perovskite films could also be manifested in the decreased absorbance along with a blue shift of the absorption onset (Fig. 1c). Encouragingly, the stability of the perovskite film was significantly improved by using DPP-based polymers as the passivation layer (thickness ≈ 20 nm), especially for PTzDPPBTz, as minor changes in XRD patterns and absorption spectra of the perovskite film upon air exposure were observed (Fig. 1b and c). PTzDPPBTz passivation could preserve the absorption characteristics of the perovskite film and prevent moisture-driven perovskite decomposition after being exposed to ambient air for 216 hours (Fig. 1b and c). We noticed that the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the XRD profile of the sample with PTzDPPBTz passivation remained nearly unchanged upon air exposure (Fig. 1b), confirming that the PTzDPPBTz passivation layer could significantly improve the air stability of the perovskite film without structural decomposition. It should be noted that the pervoskite film with PTzDPPBTz passivation exhibited enhanced light absorption at longer wavelengths (630–720 nm; see Fig. 1c), which could be attributed to the intrinsic absorption characteristic of PTzDPPBTz (see discussion below). Given that these DPP polymer-based passivation layers were all hydrophobic (water contact angle ≈ 87°; see Fig. 2a) and provided good coverage onto the perovskite surface (Fig. 2a), we suggest that the hydrophobicity and surface coverage of the passivation layers could not be responsible for the observed differences in stability testing shown in Fig. 1b and c. It should be noted that the perovskite film passivated with higher molecular weight PDPP (the number-average molecular weight = 39 kDa) still exhibited significant air-induced degradation, suggesting that molecule weight of PDPP seemed to have a negligible impact on passivation (ESI Fig. S2†). Considering that the defects existing within the perovskite layer can accelerate moisture related degradation,11,13 we speculate that the PTzDPPBTz polymer can provide superior passivation for the perovskite layer due to the presence of high-density functional groups (i.e. thiazole and carbonyl) that can strongly interact with the positively charged under-coordinated Pb vacancies and passivate these vacancies through the formation of Lewis adducts, as illustrated in Fig. 1a. To clarify this assumption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed. Compared with that of the pristine perovskite sample, the binding energy of Pb core electrons in 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 was slightly shifted to higher ionization potentials for PTzDPPBTz-coated perovskite sample, implying the presence of interaction between the perovskite and the functional groups of PTzDPPBTz (ESI Fig. S3†). The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) spectrum of the MAPbI3 film with and without the PTzDPPBTz layer is shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The incorporation of the PTzDPPBTz layer exhibited an increase in the work function of the perovskite film (0.17 eV), suggesting that the surface electronic structures of the perovskite film were altered by the PTzDPPBTz layer due to strong interaction between the Lewis base functional groups of PTzDPPBTz and the perovskite film, as we have discussed previously.

To gain more insight into the properties at the MAPbI3/PTzDPPBTz interface, the optoelectronic properties of PTzDPPBTz were also examined. The absorption spectrum of the PTzDPPBTz film is depicted in Fig. S5a (ESI†). The maximum absorption of the PTzDPPBTz film was located at 720 nm with a shoulder at 660 nm. The band gap of the PTzDPPBTz film determined from the Tauc plot was 1.63 eV (ESI Fig. S5b†). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of PTzDPPBTz determined from the cyclic voltammetry measurements was approximately 5.6 eV (ESI Fig. S6a†). Based on the results of the HOMO level and the band gap, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of PTzDPPBTz was estimated to be ≈4.0 eV (ESI Fig. S6b†), which is similar to the LUMO level of the commonly used C60 and [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) (3.9–4.2 eV). The appropriate LUMO level of PTzDPPBTz is expected to act as heterojunction interface for efficient charge transfer at the interface between the perovskite active layer and PTzDPPBTz. To confirm this, steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of the perovskite samples (glass substrate/MAPbI3 film) with and without the PTzDPPBTz layer were studied. As shown in Fig. 2b and c, the PTzDPPBTz layer caused a significant decrease in PL intensity (by ≈98%) and lifetime (from 13.9 to 1.49 ns), confirming that efficient charge transfer from the perovskite to PTzDPPBTz takes place. It should be noted that the C60-coated MAPbI3 sample without PTzDPPBTz (i.e. glass substrate/MAPbI3/C60) exhibited a slightly longer PL lifetime (1.94 ns; see the ESI Fig. S7†) when compared to the PTzDPPBTz-coated MAPbI3 sample (1.49 ns; see Fig. 2c), which possibly arose from the difficulty in achieving complete film coverage of vacuum-evaporated C60 molecules onto the rough perovskite layer. These results also confirmed the effectiveness of the PTzDPPBTz layer for efficient charge transfer at the interface. In addition, considering that DPP-containing polymers have been reported to show high charge carrier mobility,37 we also investigated the electron mobility of the PTzDPPBTz layer. The electron mobility was estimated using space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements (details of the mobility measurements are provided in the Experimental section).38 Encouragingly, PTzDPPBTz exhibited an electron mobility of ≈1.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (ESI Fig. S8†), which could facilitate efficient charge extraction and minimize undesirable charge recombination within the devices.
Having determined that PTzDPPBTz can afford superior surface passivation for the perovskite layer and exhibit good optoelectronic properties, we then move on to assess its corresponding photovoltaic performance. The device structure investigated herein was indium-tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrate/p-doped cross-linked poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethyl-phenyl)amine] (PTAA)/MAPbI3 with and without PTzDPPBTz/C60/polyethylenimine (PEI)/Ag, where molybdenum tris-[1-(trifluoroethanoyl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)ethane-1,2-dithiolene] (Mo(tfdCOCF3)3) and 1,2-bis[4-(azidomethyl)phenyl]-1,2-diphenylethene (TPE-MN3) were used as the dopant and cross-linking agent for the PTAA film, respectively.39 The chemical structures of these molecules are shown in the ESI Fig. S9.† The azide groups on TPE-MN3 are able to be converted to reactive nitrene species upon UV exposure and subsequently be inserted into C–H bonds (on PTAA) to form insoluble cross-linked networks, while deep-lying electronic states of Mo(tfdCOCF3)3 can induce p-doping via charge transfer from the HOMO of the PTAA host to the EA of Mo(tfdCOCF3)3, as demonstrated in our previous study.39 This p-doped cross-linked PTAA film has been proven to be a promising anode interfacial layer for high-performance PeSCs.39 The detailed photovoltaic parameters of the devices are summarized in Table 1, and the representative current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices measured under AM 1.5G irradiation simulated sunlight (intensity = 100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 2d. The control devices (i.e. without the passivation layer; device A) exhibited reasonable photovoltaic performances including a PCE of up to 16.58% (15.09% for the average; see Table 1 and Fig. 2d), which is in good agreement with previously reported results.1,6 Importantly, the devices based on PTzDPPBTz (device B) delivered superior PCE (maximum PCE = 18.64%) to that of the control device (16.58%), mainly due to the higher Voc value (1.09 V vs. 1.01 V), as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 2c. Considering that the majority of Voc losses have been proven to be affected by the charge traps,11 we suggest that such a high Voc is due to the benefits of surface passivation afforded by PTzDPPBTz. It should be noted that the control devices (device A) exhibited hysteretic J–V characteristics (ESI Table S2 and Fig. S10a†), while this issue was absent for the devices based on PTzDPPBTz (device B), as shown in Table S3 and Fig. S10b (ESI†). The observed hysteresis-free J–V characteristics might be associated with the fact that the PTzDPPBTz layer was able to mitigate the charge build up at defect sites by forming Lewis adducts between the positively charged under-coordinated Pb atoms and Lewis base functional groups, as discussed previously. These results elucidate that PTzDPPBTz is a highly promising passivation layer for PeSCs.

To quantitatively characterize the trap density for the devices with and without the PTzDPPBTz passivation layer, thermal admittance spectroscopy (TAS) was carried out. The energetic profile of trap density of states (tDOS) can be estimated from the frequency dependent capacitance using the following equation:17,40  where Vbi denotes the built-in potential, q is the elementary charge, W is the depletion width, C is the capacitance, ω stands for the applied angular frequency, and kB and T are the Boltzmann's constant and the absolute temperature, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2e, the control device (device A) exhibited a relatively large density of defect states (≈1020 m−3 eV−1), which could be reduced by about two orders of magnitude after depositing the PTzDPPBTz passivation layer (device B). This is consistent with the findings of recent studies and can be rationalized in terms of a stronger interaction of the perovskite with Lewis base molecules. Further investigations are needed to quantify the extent of this effect for different polymers. These results clearly elucidate the effective passivation of defect/trap states within the perovskite film by the PTzDPPBTz layer.
To gain further insight into trap assisted recombination within the devices, the relationship between Voc and light intensity was also studied. Previous studies have indicated that the deviation between the slope and the value of kBT/q reflects trap-assisted recombination.41 In our case, the slopes for the control device (device A) and the device with the PTzDPPBTz layer (device B) were 1.39 kBT/q and 1.05 kBT/q, respectively (Fig. 2f). It is worth noting that the slope of device B (1.05 kBT/q) was close to unity, implying that undesired trap-assisted recombination can be negligible through the incorporation of the PTzDPPBTz passivation layer, in good agreement with the conclusion from Fig. 2e that the PTzDPPBTz passivation layer was found to be effective in reducing the defect state density. The light intensity dependence of the fill factor was also investigated to identify bimolecular recombination in the devices. For the devices without a passivation layer (device A), the fill factor showed non-monotonic dependence on light intensity (ESI Fig. S11†), which could be ascribed to trap-assisted recombination.42,43 In contrast, the fill factor of the devices with the PTzDPPBTz passivation layer (device B) exhibited monotonic dependence on light intensity (ESI Fig. S11†), suggesting that bimolecular recombination was the dominant mechanism.42,43 The bimolecular recombination loss mechanisms in the devices with the passivation layer are worthy of further investigation, which is still in progress.
Further device performance improvement was observed by incorporating 10 mol% tetra-n-butylammonium iodide (TBAI) as the dopant into PTzDPPBTz. As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 2d, the devices with a TBAI-doped PTzDPPBTz layer (device C) exhibited a PCE of up to 20.30%, with a Jsc of 22.28 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.09 V, and a FF of 83.59%. The stabilized PCE of device D measured at a fixed maximum power point (0.98 V) reached 20.40%, as shown in Fig. 3a. It should be noted that the integrated Jsc value of the devices with TBAI-doped PTzDPPBTz (device C) obtained from the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra (22.02 mA cm−2; see Fig. 3b) was well matched (within 3% error) with the measured Jsc value (22.28 mA cm−2; see Table 1 and Fig. 2d), confirming the accuracy of our reported PCE. Such performance improvement mainly arose from the increased FF value (from 80.80% to 83.59%), as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 2d. To shed light on the origin of the enhancement in FF upon TBAI doping, the J–V characteristics of the devices were measured in the dark to investigate the series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) of the devices. The Rs and Rsh were estimated from the inverse slope of the J–V characteristics at 2 V and at 0 V, respectively. Compared to the devices with pristine PTzDPPBTz (device B), the devices with n-doped PTzDPPBTz (device C) exhibited a lower series resistance (2.85 Ω cm2vs. 107.5 Ω cm2 for device C) while retaining a high shunt resistance (≈684 kΩ cm2), as shown in Fig. 3c. The reduced series resistance of the devices by TBAI doping could be rationalized by the increased electrical conductivity of the n-doped PTzDPPBTz film. The incorporation of TBAI into organic semiconductors (e.g. fullerenes) can cause efficient n-doping via anion-induced electron transfer and therefore substantially increase film conductivity, as reported previously.44 A similar trend is observed in our case: the conductivity of PTzDPPBTz was found to be increased by more than 4 orders of magnitude upon doping with 5 mol% TBAI (Fig. 3d). The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of PTzDPPBTz films also confirmed that charge transfer takes place between TBAI and PTzDPPBTz (Fig. 3e). Benefiting from the high electrical conductivity (i.e. low series resistance) of the PTzDPPBTz layer, the resulting devices exhibited good reproducibility and had high tolerance for PTzDPPBTz thickness, delivering a PCE of over 17.23% even at a thickness of 80 nm (ESI Table S4 and Fig. S12†). The thickness-insensitive photovoltaic performance of the devices based on the PTzDPPBTz layer makes it a promising candidate for large area fabrication. As a proof-of-concept, n-doped PTzDPPBTz layer-based devices with larger active areas of 1.2 and 5.04 cm2 were also fabricated. Very encouragingly, high device performance (PCE > 16%) could be attained, as shown in Table S5 and Fig. S13 (ESI†). Note that the incorporation of the TBAI dopant into the PTzDPPBTz film would not cause adverse effects on the effectiveness of passivation, as discussed below. These results highlight the important role of TBAI doping in improving the electrical properties of the passivation layer based on π-conjugated polymers, paving the way for the large-scale fabrication of PeSCs.

The effectiveness of the TBAI-doped PTzDPPBTz passivation layer was also examined in a mixed tin-lead MASn0.25Pb0.75I3 perovskite active layer, which possessed a low band gap of ≈1.26 eV. The MASn0.25Pb0.75I3 perovskite film was prepared by an anti-solvent assisted one-step deposition method (see Experimental section for details), and its detailed characterization can be found in our previous study.39 Very importantly, as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 2d, the performance of the device based on the PTzDPPBTz layer (PCE = 15.59%; see device D in Table 1 and Fig. 2d) was superior to that of the device without passivation (PCE = 12.86%; see device E in Table 1 and Fig. 2d), suggesting that our strategy could be universally applicable for a wide variety of hybrid perovskite systems. It should be noted that the incorporation of the PTzDPPBTz passivation layer also led to a relatively high reproducibility of the devices (standard deviation of PCE = 0.88%; see device D in Table 1) when compared with those of the devices without passivation (standard deviation of PCE = 1.07%; see device E in Table 1). These results provide clear evidence of the general utility of the PTzDPPBTz passivation layer in PeSCs.
Given that hybrid perovskites are intrinsically sensitive to oxygen and moisture, perovskite film fabrication is generally carried out under an inert atmosphere,1,6,7,9 which becomes one of the main obstacles to PeSCs' commercialization. Previous studies have shown that air-processed perovskite films usually exhibit non-uniform surface coverage and poor optoelectronic properties mainly due to the uncontrollable crystallization process and rapid decomposition upon air exposure.23–35 In an attempt to prepare high-quality perovskite films under ambient conditions, in this study, the PTzDPPBTz passivation layer was applied to improve the environmental resistance of the perovskite layer upon manufacturing. To examine the feasibility of our approach, perovskite films were prepared under a controlled humid atmosphere (25 ± 2 °C and 72 ± 3% relative humidity in the air). Note that the relative humidity of the local climate is normally 60–70%. The air-processed devices without a passivation layer (device F) displayed a moderate PCE (12.79%) with large PCE deviation (1.25%), as shown in Table 2 and Fig. 3f. Very encouragingly, the incorporation of the PTzDPPBTz passivation layer for the air-processed device (device G) delivered a PCE of up to 19.19% with high reproducibility (average PCE = 17.53%; see Table 2 and Fig. 3f), which was close to that obtained for the device processed under an inert atmosphere (device C; see Table 1 and Fig. 2d). To the best of our knowledge, 19.19% represents the highest PCE ever reported for air-processed PeSCs prepared at relative humidity exceeding 70% (ESI Table S1†). Importantly, similar to that observed in the MAPbI3 system, the PTzDPPBTz passivation layer also worked well for air-processed devices based on the MASn0.25Pb0.75I3 system, affording a nearly comparable PCE (14.54%; see device H in Table 2 and Fig. 3f) to that of the device processed under an inert atmosphere (device D; see Table 1 and Fig. 2d). Note that air-processed MASn0.25Pb0.75I3-based devices without passivation (device I) delivered a much inferior PCE of 8.63% (Table 2 and Fig. 3f), possibly due to the rapid oxidation of Sn. These results clearly elucidate the necessity of PTzDPPBTz passivation for air-processed PeSCs.

Considering that PeSCs generally degrade rapidly under ambient conditions,6,9 we also investigate the stability of air-processed devices with and without a PTzDPPBTz passivation layer (devices F and G). The degradation profiles of the photovoltaic performance of these non-encapsulated air-processed MAPbI3 devices (devices F and G) under constant illumination (100 mW cm−2) at their maximum power point in ambient conditions (25 °C and 70% relative humidity) are shown in Fig. 4a. The effectiveness of surface passivation afforded by PTzDPPBTz could be also manifested in the stability testing of the devices. In contrast to the devices without the PTzDPPBTz passivation layer (device F), in which rapid efficiency deterioration was observed, the devices with the passivation layer (device G) remained relatively stable after 360 hours of continuous operation (i.e. the devices were maintained under maximum power point conditions during the test) in air (25 °C and 70% relative humidity, under continuous 100 mW cm−2 illumination), as shown in Fig. 4a. The remarkable stability achieved with these devices was attributed to the fact that the PTzDPPBTz film could effectively passivate the defect/trap states within the perovskite film and form a hydrophobic coating over the perovskite active layer, as discussed above. It should be noted that the incorporation of the TBAI dopant into the PTzDPPBTz film seems not to have a negative impact on the effectiveness of passivation, as a similar degradation profile was observed for the devices with the TBAI dopant (device G) in comparison to the devices without the dopant (device B), as shown in Fig. S14 (ESI†). Encouragingly, the device stability can be significantly improved by using organic-based bilayer films consisting of UV-curable epoxy (40 μm) and a hydrophobic fluorinated polymer CYTOP (25 μm) as the encapsulation layer. This encapsulation layer was formed by doctor-blade coating, which is compatible with cost-efficient scalable manufacturing. As shown in Fig. 4a, the encapsulated device G remained at ≈65% of its initial efficiency after 890 hours of continuous operation (i.e. the devices were maintained under maximum power point conditions during the test) in ambient air (25 °C and 70% relative humidity, under continuous 100 mW cm−2 illumination). It should be noted that shelf-life stability (i.e. the evolution of device efficiency as a function of time during storage under dark ambient conditions) of the encapsulated device G was also examined, and an ≈28% loss of PCE over 9600 hours of storage was observed (Fig. 4b). The gas barrier performance of UV-curable epoxy (40 μm)/Cytop (25 μm) films was also determined by the electrical calcium (Ca) corrosion test, whose device structure is shown in the inset of Fig. S15 (ESI†). Interestingly, such encapsulation films showed moderate gas barrier performance, with a water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) of ≈1.5 × 10−2 g per m2 per day (ESI Fig. S15†), suggesting that rigorous encapsulation of the devices with the PTzDPPBTz passivation layer may not be essential. Further investigations are going on to clarify the underlying mechanism. It should be noted that the organic-based encapsulation layer demonstrated herein is highly compatible with flexible plastic substrates, which can withstand continuous cyclic bending 6000 times (bending radius = 3 mm) without sacrificing its barrier performance (WVTR ≈10−2 g per m2 per day). These results highlight the importance of employing an appropriate passivation layer and encapsulation layer for developing high-performance and stable PeSCs without the need for inert environment fabrication.

A series connection of multiple subcells via an interconnecting layer (ICL) to form monolithic multi-junction tandem device architectures has been proven to be one of the most promising strategies to increase the efficiency of PeSCs.45–47 In order to maximize Voc output (and therefore the performance) of the tandem cells, the minimization of the defect/trap-caused energy losses within the devices appears to be essential. Herein, we also apply our passivation strategy in monolithic all-perovskite tandem solar cells, in which the large band gap MAPbI3 front subcell is connected in series with the low band gap MASn0.25Pb0.75I3 rear subcell by an ICL comprising n-doped PTzDPPBTz (20 nm)/C60(80 nm)/PEI (10 nm)/p-doped cross-linked PTAA (90 nm), as shown in Fig. 4c. It should be noted that the ICL used herein has several desirable advantages for tandem cells such as reasonable optical transmittance (≈90% at 550 nm; see the ESI Fig. S16†) and good solvent resistance as evidenced by the almost comparable absorption spectrum of the ICL-coated MAPbI3 sample before and after rinsing with N,N-dimethylformamide (see the ESI Fig. S17†). To investigate the effect of the PTzDPPBTz passivation layer, the tandem cells without the passivation layer were also fabricated for comparison. The perovskite layer thicknesses used for MAPbI3/MASn0.25Pb0.75I3-based tandem cells were 150 nm and 350 nm for the MAPbI3 and MASn0.25Pb0.75I3 layer, respectively, as determined from the optical simulation results shown in our previous work.39 The corresponding J–V characteristics of the tandem devices are shown in Fig. 4d. Very encouragingly, with the PTzDPPBTz passivation layer, the maximum achievable efficiency of the tandem cell (device J) was 17.91%, outperforming those of the devices without passivation (device K), which displayed a moderate PCE of 12.18%, as shown in Table 3 and Fig. 4d. The superior PCE afforded by the PTzDPPBTz passivation layer was mainly due to an increase in VOC (1.87 V vs. 1.76 V; see Table 3 and Fig. 4d), which could be rationalized by the reduction of defect/vacancy-caused energy losses via PTzDPPBTz passivation. Considering that the interfacial losses in multi-junction structure tandem solar cells can become more pronounced than what are observed for single-junction device systems, for the first time, our results highlight the importance of surface passivation for perovskite tandem solar cells. It should be noted that the Voc of the tandem cells with passivation (1.87 V; see device J in Table 3 and Fig. 4d) was nearly the sum of those of the individual subcells (1.88 V; see device C and D in Table 1 and Fig. 2d), confirming the effectiveness of the ICL adopted therein. Given that our passivation strategy is facile and applicable for different types of perovskite systems, it can pave the way for the development of tandem PeSCs exploiting novel perovskite materials, which is very promising to further boost the PCE of the devices.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells via introducing a DPP-based semiconducting polymer PTzDPPBTz as the passivation layer. The PTzDPPBTz layer can effectively passivate under-coordinated Pb2+ vacancies through the formation of Lewis adducts without detrimentally altering the properties of the perovskite film. With the aid of TBAI molecular doping, the devices employing the PTzDPPBTz layer exhibit a high PCE of up to 20.30% (stabilized PCE = 20.39%) without hysteresis in J–V sweeps. Importantly, this passivation strategy is highly applicable for air-processed devices prepared at a high relative humidity level (72 ± 3%), and a remarkable PCE of 19.19% is achieved, which represents the highest efficiency ever reported for air-processed PeSCs prepared at the relative humidity exceeding 70%. This strategy can also be extended to monolithic all-perovskite tandem solar cells, and an extraordinarily high Voc of 1.87 V is attained, which is much higher than those of the tandem cells without a passivation layer (1.76 V). This is the first demonstration of high-efficiency monolithic all-perovskite tandem solar cells through the incorporation of π-conjugated polymers as the passivation layer. More encouragingly, significant stability enhancement of the devices is achieved by simply employing UV-curable epoxy/fluorinated polymer bilayer films as the encapsulation layer, retaining about 65% of the initial efficiency after 890 hours of continuous operation in ambient air. This work highlights the importance of defect passivation in PeSCs by employing thiazole-bridged DPP-based conjugated polymers. Our findings provide valuable guidelines for the rational design of a new passivation layer for achieving stable and efficient air-processed PeSCs.
Experimental
Materials
Patterned ITO-coated glass substrates (sheet resistance = 15 ohm sq−1) were purchased from Ruilong Tech. Lead iodide (PbI2; 99.99%), methylammonium iodide (MAI; 99.5%), PTAA (Mw = 17500 g mol−1), and C60 (>99.5%) were purchased from Lumtec. PC61BM (>99.5%) was purchased from Solenne. TPE-MN3, Mo(tfdCOCF3)3, and PEI were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. UV-curable epoxy was purchased from Electro-Lite Corporation. Cytop was purchased from Asahi Glass. Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.
Synthesis of PDPP and PTzDPPBTz
PDPP and PTzDPPBTz are previously known conjugated polymers and they were readily synthesized and characterized according to procedures in the literature.48,49 The scheme for the synthesis of these two polymers is illustrated in Fig. S18 (ESI†). The number-average molecular weights measured by gel permeation chromatography were 19 kDa (polydispersity = 1.9) and 47 kDa (polydispersity = 2.1) for PDPP and PTzDPPBTz, respectively. PDPP with a higher number-average molecular weight of 39 kDa was also synthesized for comparison.
Preparation of the MAPbI3 precursor
576 mg PbI2 and 199 mg MAI were first dissolved in a mixed solvent of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF; 0.8 mL)/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; 0.2 mL). The solution was then stirred at 70 °C for 12 hours before use.
Preparation of the MASn0.25Pb0.75I3 precursor
345.7 mg PbI2 and 159 mg MAI were first dissolved in a mixed solvent (1 mL) of DMF/DMSO (1:1 v/v). After stirring at room temperature for 60 min, the solutions were then added to a vial with 93.1 mg SnI2 and stirred at 70 °C for 12 hours before use. It should be noticed that SnI2 powder was stored in an inert atmosphere in a glove box (<1 ppm of O2 and H2O) to avoid oxidation.
Device fabrication based on MAPbI3 and MASn0.25Pb0.75I3 perovskite films
The device structure of the single-junction solar cell is shown in Fig. 1a. Patterned ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned stepwise in detergent, water, acetone, and 2-propanol under ultra-sonication for 20 min each and subsequently pretreated with UV-ozone for 60 min. Afterward, the PTAA solution (6 mg mL−1 in anhydrous chloroform) along with 5 wt% TPE-MN3 and 1 wt% Mo(tfdCOCF3)3 was spin-coated on the cleaned ITO substrate at 3000 rpm for 60 s (thickness = 40 nm). Cross-linking was then conducted using UV light (λ = 254 nm; intensity = 5 mW cm−2) for 20 min. The perovskite layer examined herein was formed by employing an anti-solvent dripping strategy. For MAPbI3-based devices, the MAPbI3 precursor solution (filtered with a 0.45 μm PTFE filter) was spin-coated onto the preheated substrate (95 °C for 20 min) at 800 rpm for 5 s and 4000 rpm for 30 s sequentially. Note that 150 μL anhydrous ethyl acetate was slowly dripped on the substrates in the first 25 s of the second stage. The samples were then annealed at 105 °C for 15 min (thickness = 430 nm). For MASn0.25Pb0.75I3-based devices, the MASn0.25Pb0.75I3 precursor solution (filtered with a 0.45 μm PTFE filter) was spin-coated onto the preheated substrate (105 °C for 20 min) at 1000 rpm for 10 s and 5000 rpm for 40 s sequentially. Note that 200 μL anhydrous ethyl acetate was slowly dripped on the substrates in the first 20 s of the second stage. The samples were then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min (thickness = 350 nm). For the samples with a passivation layer, the PTzDPPBTz solution (7 mg mL−1 in anhydrous chloroform; filtered with 0.45 μm PTFE filter) was then spin-coated on top of the formed perovskite layers before thermal annealing. Different PTzDPPBTz layer thicknesses (20–80 nm) were obtained by adjusting the solution concentration. Afterward, the C60 layer (40 nm) was deposited using a thermal evaporator under high vacuum (<10−6 torr), followed by spin-coating PEI solution (1 mg mL−1 in anhydrous IPA; filtered with a 0.45 μm Nylon filter) at 4000 rpm for 60 s (thickness = 10 nm). The opaque Ag (200 nm) layer was deposited using a thermal evaporator under high vacuum (<10−6 torr). To eliminate the Jsc from regions outside the active area, illumination masks with different aperture sizes (0.12, 1.2 or 5.04 cm2) were used. For the devices with encapsulation, UV-curable epoxy (40 μm) and Cytop (25 μm) were adopted as the gas permeation barrier to prevent the ingression of moisture and oxygen into the devices. Both films were fabricated by repeated doctor-blade coating until the desired thickness was reached.
Tandem device fabrication
The device architecture of the tandem solar cell is shown in Fig. 4c. The front and rear subcells were made according to the fabrication procedure of single-junction devices. The ICL used herein comprises TBAI-doped PTzDPPBTz (20 nm)/C60(80 nm)/PEI (10 nm)/Mo(tfdCOCF3)3-doped cross-linked PTAA (90 nm). Note that details of the preparation and characterization of the Mo(tfdCOCF3)3-doped cross-linked PTAA film can be found in our previous work.39 To eliminate the Jsc from regions outside the active area, illumination masks with an aperture size of 0.12 cm2 were used.
Characterization
The device characteristics were evaluated in ambient air under an AM1.5 G AAA class solar simulator (XES-100S1, SAN-EI Electric. Co. Ltd.) with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. A Hamamatsu silicon solar cell (S1133) with a KG5 color filter, which belongs to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), was used as the reference cell. To calibrate the light intensity of the solar simulator, the power of the xenon lamp was adjusted to make the Jsc of the reference cell under simulated sun light as high as it was under the calibration conditions. The J–V curves were measured by using a Keithley digital source meter (Model 2420). Unless otherwise stated, the scan rate was set at 0.15 V s−1. After initial measurements, the devices were kept under controlled ambient humidity conditions using an indigenously made environmental control chamber. The optical absorption of the samples was recorded on a Varian Carry 500 spectrometer (Varian). Steady-state PL spectra were measured at room temperature by using a fluorescent spectrophotometer (Hitachi F-4600) with a 150 W Xe lamp as the excitation source at 630 nm. Time-resolved PL decay spectra were recorded by using a time-correlated single-photon counting system (Edinburgh Instruments FL920), and the excitation light pulse was provided using a picosecond diode laser at a wavelength of 600 nm. The PL lifetimes of the samples were calculated by fitting the experimental decay transient data to the double-exponential decay model. IPCE spectra were acquired in DC mode using a lock-in amplifier with a current preamplifier under short-circuit conditions with illumination of monochromatic light from a 250 W quartz-halogen lamp (Osram) passing through a mono-chromator. The electron mobility was extracted from the dark J–V characteristics of the electron-only devices by using the SCLC model:38  where ε0 is the permittivity of free space (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), εr is the relative permittivity of the material (assumed as 3), μ is electron mobility, γ is the field activation factor, and L is the thickness of the PTzDPPBTz layer. The electron-only device was constructed as ITO-coated glass substrate/PEI (10 nm)/PTzDPPBTz/Ca (40 nm)/Al (100 nm). The surface morphology of the films was studied using tapping mode AFM of a Digital Instrument D3100CL. The tDOS of the devices were derived from frequency-dependent capacitance measurement by using a precision LCR meter (Agilent). Cyclic voltammetry was performed under an inert atmosphere using 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate as the supporting electrolyte (scan rate = 0.1 V s−1). The ITO-coated glass substrate covered with a thin layer polymer (10 nm) was used as the working electrode. The counter and reference electrodes were Pt and Ag/AgCl, respectively. The corresponding HOMO level was calculated using the onset of Eox using the absolute value of −4.8 eV to vacuum for the Fc/Fc+ redox potential. The electrical conductivities of the films were measured by using a four point probe setup with a source measurement unit (Keithley 2400). The EPR spectra were performed at room temperature using a Bruker ELEXSYS E-580 EPR spectrometer. Sample solutions were added to the EPR test tubes and then degassed with nitrogen to form films on the tube walls at room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere. The work function of the sample was measured with a ULVAC-PHI PHI 5000 Versaprobe II X-ray photoelectron spectrometer employing a mono-chromatic focused Al-Kα X-ray source and hemispherical analyzer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was conducted with a field-emission SEM (JSM-7500F, JEOL) operated at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV with the samples coated with ≈3 nm of platinum. XRD patterns were recorded using a multi-function high power X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8 DISCOVER SSS) with a the CuK source (wavelength = 1.541 Å). The film thicknesses were measured by using a Tencor Alpha-step surface profiler.
Electrical analysis on corroded Ca films
The structure of the device used for a Ca test is shown in the inset of Fig. S12 (ESI†). The Ca film (thickness = 250 nm) and Ag contacts (thickness = 100 nm) were deposited by thermal evaporation through shadow masks on the glass substrates. The Ca layer along with part of the Ag contacts were then covered with UV-curable epoxy (40 μm)/Cytop (25 μm) films. The Ca degradation test was performed under controlled environmental conditions (30 °C and 85% relative humidity in a pure nitrogen environment). The WVTR value was deduced from the average slope of the evolution of conductance (dC/dt) using the following relation:50–52  where n is the molar equivalent of the degradation reaction which is assumed as n = 2 from the chemical reaction of Ca with water molecules. δ is the density of Ca (1.55 g cm−3), ρ is the specific resistance of Ca (9 × 10−8 Ω m), and Mreagent and MCa correspond to the molar masses of the permeating reagent and Ca, respectively. l and w are the effective length and width of the Ca layer, respectively. C represents the conductance. In our case, the initial resistance of the Ca layer is ∼8.4 × 10−8 Ω m, and l and w are 3 and 0.5 cm, respectively.
