    , Accepted 28th May 2023First published on 29th May 2023AbstractIn order to achieve organic photodetectors with high performance for health detection, ZnO based inverted organic photodetectors using PTB7-Th:PC61BM as the active layer were fabricated with morphological and interfacial modification. Using chlorobenzene instead of 1,2-dichlorobenzene as the solvent, the active layer spin-coated on the pristine ZnO layer exhibited more uniform phase separation, which was favorable for charge transport and charge collection. The dark current density and external quantum efficiency could be effectively regulated by changing the active layer thickness, the annealing temperature and the applied bias. When ZnO was modified with ethylene glycol (EG), the valence band maximum of ZnO decreased and the potential barrier of hole injection from the indium tin oxide electrode increased, resulting in a lower dark current density of ZnO/EG based devices. The improved external quantum efficiency and reduced dark current density of ZnO/EG based organic photodetectors were attributed to the amount of trap reduction using the capacitance–frequency curve, charge transfer resistance increase using impedance analysis and charge doping density reduction using Mott–Schottky analysis. Compared to pristine ZnO based organic photodetectors, the dark current density of ZnO/EG based organic photodetectors was reduced to 7.85 × 10−9 A cm−2 by almost two orders of magnitude. Eventually, inverted ZnO/EG based organic photodetectors achieved a high specific detectivity of up to 9.11 × 1012 Jones and a fast response as low as 1 μs, and have great potential for health monitoring applications.
Introduction
In recent years, organic photodetectors (OPDs) have been widely explored in health monitoring because of their wide spectral response and fast response speed.1–4 Compared to inorganic photodetectors, OPDs have the advantages of easy fabrication, flexibility, and low cost.5–7 Different from organic solar cells (OSCs), OPDs work under reverse bias, and their main function is to convert optical signals into electrical signals, so it is necessary for OPDs to achieve a lower dark current density (JD) under the reverse bias.8–10 It is well-known that the noise current is closely related to JD. There are several methods to reduce JD, including the increase of the charge injection barrier by the interlayer materials and the reduction of the number of defects in the active layer and the noise current, resulting in a higher specific detectivity (D*) of OPDs.
Researchers incorporated an electron blocking layer (EBL) and a hole blocking layer (HBL) between the active layer and the metal electrode to reduce JD by increasing the injection barrier of electrons and holes.11–14 Zhenqiang Huang et al.13 inserted copper(I) thiocyanate (CuSCN) with a shallow conductivity band between the active layer and indium tin oxide (ITO) anode to replace poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly (styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as the EBL, and the electron injection barrier increased from 1.7 eV to 3.2 eV. The JD was decreased to 2.3 × 10−10 A cm−2 at −0.1 V bias with nearly two orders of magnitude lower. The high D* of 4.4 × 1013 Jones was obtained at 870 nm. Anubha Bilgaiyan et al.3 inserted a HBL (HATCN) with a deeper valence band between the active layer and the ITO cathode, and an EBL (T2T) with a shallow conductivity band between the active layer and the aluminum anode, and the injection barriers of holes and electrons increased from 0.3 eV and 0.78 eV to 4.5 eV and 1.28 eV, respectively. The JD was reduced to as low as 9.69 × 10−9 A cm−2 and D* of 5.69 × 1012 Jones was obtained at 610 nm under −1 V bias. As for the inverted OPD device, the materials of arginine (Arg),15 poly9,9-BIS (3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylFluorene)] (PFN)16,17 and polyethyleneimine ethoxylated (PEIE)18,19 were exploited to modify the surface of the ITO cathode, so as to reduce the work function of ITO and increase the injection barrier of holes. When modified by Arg, the work function of ITO was reduced to 3.6 eV, and the hole injection barrier was increased by 1.1 eV. The JD was decreased to 3.39 × 10−10 A cm−2 by more than an order of magnitude under 0.1 V reverse bias, gaining D* of more than 1013 Jones at 775 nm.15 The work function of ITO could be reduced to 4.55 eV by the formation of a thin dipole layer due to the preferential absorption of the ammonium groups of the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide cations onto the ITO surface. Without using HBL, the JD of 1.3 × 10−8 A cm−2 and D* up to 2.5 × 1012 Jones were obtained under −1 V bias.20 Furthermore, the unique structure of the vertical bulk heterojunction has also been fabricated to increase the injection barrier of electrons and holes simultaneously.10,21,22 The double transfer stamping23 was exploited to deposit the active layer, in which the acceptor layer was first deposited onto the ZnO layer, and then the bulk heterojunction layer and the donor layer were deposited subsequently. When the reverse bias was applied, the injection barrier of holes and electrons was increased, because the hole (electron) injection into the donor (acceptor) preferred to be injected into the acceptor (donor) layer. The JD was reduced to 5 × 10−9 A cm−2, and D* reached 1.48 × 1013 Jones under -0.5 V bias.24
On the other hand, the JD reduction could also be attributed to the reduction of the leakage current, which resulted from the charge recombination reduced by the decrease of the number of defects in the active layer. Moreover, the EQE could be increased simultaneously by the increase in the number of charge carriers.25–30 Therefore, it is important to correctly judge the reduction of the number of defects in the active layer by suitable analysis methods. The internal potential of OPD devices and the acceptor concentration in the active layer film could be analyzed using UV photoelectron spectroscopy and the Mott–Schottky curve. It was indicated that the effective quenching of acceptor defects brought about the reduction of acceptor defect density. When the intrinsic doping level was significantly dropped, the depletion layer width of the metal/polymer Schottky junction was apparently augmented, which was beneficial to exciton dissociation and thus reduced JD.31 The defects of devices could be characterized by the impedance technology by measuring the capacitance of devices at the frequency of 10–104 Hz. It was indicated that the number of defects gradually diminished with the decrease of the acceptor contents in the active layer, resulting in the reduction of JD.32JD and EQE could also be regulated by adjusting the annealing temperature, the thickness,33–35 the mass ratio of the active layer36–38 and the applied bias.39–41 In addition, for traditional inverted organic photodetectors, a variety of strategies have been exploited on ZnO to improve the performance of OPDs, such as mixing different weight concentrations of PEIE with ZnO42 and deposition of Mg-doped ZnO on ZnO films.43 However, these methods usually lead to the decrease of EQE while reducing JD. Therefore, the effective methods were to improve the injection barrier of holes and reduce the number of defects in the active layer for the improvement of the OPD performance.
In this work, inverted ZnO-based OPDs were fabricated, in which a sol–gel precursor solution of ZnO was used and deposited as the HBL. The binary alcohol as the interlayer modifier was used to modify the ZnO surface to suppress the number of defects in the active layer. The role of the alcohol modification in the ZnO surface for the PTB7-Th:PC61BM based photovoltaic device has been well discussed in a previous work.44 As for the OPD device, when the ZnO surface was modified by ethylene glycol (EG), deeper valence bands were obtained, and the injection barrier of holes was increased, further reducing the JD generated by charge injection. The device performance was also optimized by tuning solvents, annealing temperatures, and active layer thickness. Finally, low JD, high light current, high D* and fast response speed were obtained for the ZnO/EG based OPD device. The effects of interfacial modifications of ZnO on carrier mobility and exciton dissociation were investigated via Mott–Schottky curves by analyzing the doping density and depletion layer width. The capacitance–frequency (C–F) curve was determined to analyze the number of defects and gain insight into the effect of different alcohol modifications on charge recombination. The electrochemical impedance spectra were measured to investigate the relationship between JD and shunt resistance of alcohol-modified devices.
Experimental section
Solution preparation
Zinc acetate dihydrate (62.5 mg) and ethanolamine (9 μL) were dissolved in 2-methoxyethanol (1 mL), and stirred at room temperature for 12 hours. A ZnO precursor solution was prepared. The binary alcohol (2 μL), such as EG, ethanedithiol (EDT) and 1, 3-propanediol (PDO), was dissolved in acetonitrile solvent (1 mL) to prepare the modified layer solution. The donor PTB7-Th and the acceptor PC61BM were used as the active layer, and their molecular structures are shown in Fig. 1(a). The donor and acceptor (1:1.5, w/w) were dissolved in chlorobenzene (CB) or 1, 2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) with a concentration of 25 mg mL−1, using 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO, 3 vol%) as the solvent additive. The solution was stirred on a hot plate at 55 °C for 12 h.

Device preparation
The ITO was cleaned with the detergent, the deionized water, the acetone and the isopropyl alcohol, respectively. The cleaned ITO was treated by UV-O3 for 30 min. Pristine ZnO (p-ZnO) precursor solution was spin-coated at 3000 rpm and annealed at 200 °C for 1 h. Different alcohol solutions were spin-coated on p-ZnO film at 4000 rpm and annealed at 120 °C for 10 min to obtain the modified ZnO (m-ZnO) films. The active layer of PTB7-Th:PC61BM was deposited by spin-coating on ZnO with thermal annealing for 30 min. The MoO3 (3 nm) and Ag (100 nm) layers were thermally vacuum evaporated. The inverted OPD device structure of ITO/p-ZnO (or m-ZnO)/PTB7-Th:PC61BM/MoO3/Ag is shown in Fig. 1(a).
Results and discussion
Morphological modification
In order to study the effect of different solvents on the performance of OPDs, the active layer of PTB7-Th:PC61BM was dissolved in CB and DCB, respectively. The active layer films were deposited by spin-coating at 900 rpm and by thermal annealing at 110 °C. In comparison, DCB was usually exploited as the optimal solvent in most PTB7-Th:PC61BM based OSC devices, which was expected to achieve high EQE and high power conversion efficiency of 9–10%.45
The JD of the device using the solvents of CB and DCB was measured by the Keithley 4200 under −2 to 2 V, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The JD increased with the increase of the applied bias, because the number of injected carriers gradually increased with the increase of the bias. The JD of the device using CB as the solvent was one order of magnitude lower than that of the device with DCB as the solvent under the reverse bias. The EQE of the device using different solvents of CB and DCB was measured by the solar cell quantum efficiency test system under −0.2 V bias, as shown in Fig. 2(b). When DCB was used as the solvent, the EQE reached 69.9% at the wavelength of 700 nm. In comparison, the EQE of the device using CB as the solvent was significantly improved in the wide spectral range of 300–850 nm, with a maximum EQE value of 74.1% at 730 nm, with a redshift of 30 nm. In order to gain insight into the reason for the increase of EQE using CB as the solvent, the surface morphologies of the two active layers were measured by the Bruker atomic force microscope Dimension Icon (Fig. 2(c and d)). The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the active layer with CB as the solvent (1.71 nm) was smaller than that of the device with DCB as the solvent (2.73 nm). It was expected that the much smoother surface of the device prepared with CB as the solvent was conducive to the charge carrier to be transported and collected by the electrode.46,47 The pinholes and defects were observed from the active layer deposited from the solvent of DCB. In comparison, the active layer deposited from the solvent of CB possessed a homogenous phase separation, which was favorable for charge dissociation.48 Based on the above results, the CB was screened out as the optimal solvent to achieve a high EQE and low JD for the PTB7-Th:PC61BM based OPDs. To be noteworthy, the D* of the OPDs device using DCB as the solvent could not reach 1012 Jones, even though the device was optimized by adjusting the thickness of the active layer, the annealing temperature and the surface modification of ZnO with alcohols, as shown in Fig. S1, S2, S3, and Table S1 (ESI†).

In order to obtain the optimal film thickness and annealing temperature of PTB7-Th:PC61BM as the active layer with CB as the solvent, the JD and EQE of p- and m-ZnO based OPD devices with different thickness were investigated by controlling the spin-coating speed with thermal annealing of 100–120 °C, as shown in Fig. S4(a–c) (ESI†). The main purpose of OPDs was to effectively capture the light of specific wavelength and convert optical signals into electrical signals for output. Therefore, the JD was required to be low enough, so a relatively thick active layer was needed. With the gradual increase in device thickness, the shunt resistance was enhanced, thus reducing the JD.49–53 In addition, as shown in Fig. S4(d–f) (ESI†), with the decrease of the active layer thickness, the EQE of the device increased significantly, which was a result of the charge transport distance and the probability of charge recombination being decreased.49–51 After the comparison of JD and EQE, the optimum active layer thickness and annealing temperature were selected as 145 nm and 120 °C, respectively.
External quantum efficiency and responsivity
The defects on ZnO film are originally more sensitive to the adsorption and desorption of water and oxygen molecules in the environment. The effects of the surface modification of ZnO with different alcohols on the power conversion efficiency of fullerene-based OSCs44 and the specific detectivity of non-fullerene based OPDs have been investigated in a previous work.54 In order to further investigate the effect of alcohol interface modification of ZnO on the PTB7-Th:PC61BM based OPD performance, the EQE measurements of p- and m-ZnO based OPDs were carried out. The R is calculated using the following equation, (1)where λ is the wavelength corresponding to EQE.
As shown in Fig. 3(a), p-ZnO based OPD devices exhibited a broad spectral response of 300–850 nm, indicating that both the donor PTB7-Th and the acceptor PC61BM contributed to the overall optical response. When no bias was applied (0 V), the maximum value of EQE of the p-ZnO devices at 730 nm was 69.4%. When the applied bias was −0.1 V, the maximum EQE reached 72.2% at 730 nm, with an increase of 4.0%; when the applied bias increased from −0.1 V to −0.4 V, the maximum value of EQE increased to 76.2% at 730 nm, with an increase of 5.5%. With the increase of the applied bias, the internal potential was gradually increased, which facilitated the charge transport and exciton dissociation, thus improving the EQE.55,56

As shown in Fig. 3(b), the EQE of OPD devices with p- and m-ZnO with different binary alcohols as the electron transporting layer (ETL) were compared under 0.1 V reverse bias. The EQE of OPDs devices with p- and m-ZnO as ETLs were also measured under 0.2 V, 0.3 V and 0.4 V reverse bias, respectively, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). It was observed that the EQE and R of m-ZnO devices were higher than that of p-ZnO devices in the wavelength range of 300–850 nm. The maximum value of EQE of ZnO/EG based devices reached 77.5% at 730 nm, and R was calculated to be 0.456, with an increase of 7.3% compared to that of p-ZnO based devices (0.425). It was comparable to that of previously reported OPDs using PTB7-Th:PC70BM as the active layer.24 It was likely that the surface defects of the active layer films deposited on the m-ZnO surface were decreased and the probability of the charge recombination was reduced, thus improving the optical response of the OPDs. The effect of defects on the charge recombination will be demonstrated in the following capacitance–frequency section.
To account for the EQE improvement of devices modified with different alcohols, the AFM height images of the bulk heterojunction layers of p-ZnO and m-ZnO based devices were measured, as shown in Fig. 4(a–d). Compared with p-ZnO based devices (2.79 nm), the RMS of the active layer on ZnO/EG and ZnO/PDO layers decreased to 2.60 nm and 2.55 nm. The smoother surface of the active layer in ZnO/EG and ZnO/PDO based devices was conducive to the collection of carriers by the electrodes at both ends,57,58 which was consistent with the improved EQE of ZnO/EG and ZnO/PDO based devices. In addition, the phase separation degree of the active layers in different devices were observed from the three-dimensional AFM diagrams in Fig. 4(e–h). Compared with p-ZnO based devices, the donor and acceptor in the active layer of ZnO/EG and ZnO/PDO based devices formed a good interpenetrating network structure, which was conducive to exciton dissociation at the interface of the donor and acceptor. Furthermore, the relationship between the short-circuit current density (JSC) of different devices and light intensity was investigated to analyze the bimolecular recombination after alcohol modification, as shown in Fig. 4(i–l). The recombination parameter (α) was defined by the equation of JSC–Pα, where α is an exponential factor.59 When the value of α was closer to 1, the bimolecular recombination was reduced, and a better device performance was achieved. Compared to the p-ZnO based device (α = 0.939), the α of ZnO/EG and ZnO/PDO based devices increased to 0.964 and 0.967, which was consistent with the results of JD and EQE measured in actual devices.

Dark current density
In order to investigate the effect of alcohol modification of ZnO on the OPDs performance, the JD of OPD devices was also measured and compared with and without alcohol modification on ZnO. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the JD of ZnO/EG and ZnO/PDO based devices decreased significantly at low bias, while the JD of ZnO/EDT based devices had no obvious change. Compared to the p-ZnO based OPDs with a JD of 1.12 × 10−7 A cm−2, the JD of ZnO/EG based OPD devices decreased to 7.85 × 10−9 A cm−2 by more than one order of magnitude under −0.1 V bias.
 Fig. 5  (a) Dark current density of p- and m-ZnO based OPDs devices. (b) Capacitance–frequency curves of p- and m-ZnO based OPD devices. 
The JD of OPDs was mainly composed of the leakage current generated by charge injection under external bias, and the leakage current generated by charge recombination caused by trap.25 In order to clarify the reason for the decrease of JD of the m-ZnO based OPDs, the effects of alcohol modification on the charge injection barrier and charge recombination were investigated. On one hand, according to the energy level alignments in Fig. 1(b), the valence band maximum (VBM) of ZnO decreased with modification by PDO and EG, while the VBM of ZnO with EDT modification increased. When the reverse bias is applied, holes are injected into the VBM of ZnO from the cathode. Compared to p-ZnO based OPDs, the hole injection barrier of ZnO/EG based OPDs increased from 3.16 eV to 3.27 eV, which made it more difficult to inject holes into the active layer, thus reducing the JD. However, the hole injection barrier of ZnO/EDT based OPDs decreased to 3.00 eV, which made it unfavorable for the reduction of JD.51,60
On the other hand, the probability of charge recombination could be increased by the space charge accumulation near the traps existing in the active layer, thus increasing the leakage current. In order to investigate the effect of alcohol modification of ZnO on the leakage current generated by charge recombination, the C–F curve was measured by the multifunctional organic photoelectric measurement system (Paios) to judge the state of traps, including deep traps and the number of traps.61,62 As shown in Fig. 5(b), when the frequency was less than 100 Hz, the capacitance of p-ZnO based devices decreased rapidly with the increase of frequency, which indicated that there were deep traps inside the devices that made charge recombination easier. However, the capacitance of the ZnO/EG based device decreased slowly, which is indicative of fewer deep traps observed. Therefore, the probability of charge recombination was effectively reduced to decrease the JD.26,28 When the frequency was in the range of 100 Hz–1 MHz, it was observed that the capacitance of p- and m-ZnO based OPDs decreased slowly with the increase of frequency. Compared to that of the p-ZnO device, the capacitance of ZnO/EG based devices was much lower at the same frequency, which indicated that there were fewer traps in the devices. The charge accumulation near the traps was effectively inhibited to reduce the probability of charge recombination,28 so that a lower JD and higher EQE were obtained for ZnO/EG based devices.
In addition, in order to ensure experimental repeatability, the JD under −0.1 V bias of 56 devices modified with alcohols in different batches were counted, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The JD of ZnO/EG based devices was lower than 10−7 A cm−2. The mean and standard deviation were 3.04 × 10−8 A cm−2 and 3 × 10−8 A cm−2, which were much lower than p-ZnO based devices of 1.07 × 10−7 A cm−2 and 9.27 × 10−8 A cm−2, respectively. Therefore, ZnO/EG based OPDs exhibited small device deviation due to few traps in the active layer.
Moreover, the carrier mobility of different devices was measured, as shown in Fig. S7 and S8 (ESI†). The mobility of ZnO/EG based devices of 7.05 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 was measured at a reverse bias of 0.5 V, higher than that of p-ZnO based devices of 3.05 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. This could be attributed to the reduction of the probability of carrier recombination and the improvement of the charge transport, which were due to the fewer defects and lower doping concentration in the device.28,63,64
Specific detectivity
Assuming that the loose particle noise is the main noise under reverse bias, the D* is calculated by the following equation,38,65 (2)where q is the electric quantity carried by unit charge.
As shown in Fig. 6, the specific detectivity of p- and m-ZnO based OPDs was presented in the wavelength range of 300–850 nm. The main performance parameters of different devices at 730 nm under 0.1–0.4 V reverse bias are listed in Table 1. The maximum EQE of ZnO/PDO based OPDs was higher than that of ZnO/EG at 730 nm under −0.1 V bias, which was consistent with the lower capacitance of ZnO/PDO based OPDs at the frequency of 100 Hz–1 MHz. Although the EQE of ZnO/EG based OPDs was slightly lower than that ofZnO/PDO based devices, the JD of ZnO/EG based OPDs was much lower than that of ZnO/PDO based OPDs, which could be attributed to the decreased number of defects existing in the active layer. Eventually, ZnO/EG based OPD devices achieved a high D* of 9.11 × 1012 Jones at 730 nm under −0.1 V bias in this work.

In addition to the loose particle noise, the dark current used for the calculation of detectivity in OPDs also includes shot noise, thermal noise, and 1/f frequency. Therefore, the noise spectrum density (Sn) of different devices was measured to calculate D* under −0.1 V bias by the low frequency noise test system. The specific detectivity was calculated using the following equation,66–68 (3) (4)where A is the effective area of OPD, B is the normalized bandwidth (1 Hz), and Sn is the noise spectrum density in A Hz−1/2.
As shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), after modification with different alcohols, the total noise current of m-ZnO based OPDs was significantly reduced. As for ZnO/EG based OPDs, the noise current was obviously suppressed to <10−13 A Hz−1/2. The noise spectral density of 4.87 × 10−14 A Hz−1/2 of the ZnO/EG based device was obtained at the frequency of 10 kHz, and the D* of 2.59 × 1012 Jones was calculated at 730 nm, which was comparable to that of recently reported OPDs using PTB7-Th:PC70BM as the active layer (1.48 × 1013 Jones),24 and inorganic photodetector InGaAs (5.18 × 1011 Jones).69
Impedance analysis and Mott–Schottky analysis
In order to further gain insight into the effect of alcohol modification of ZnO on the JD, Nyquist curves of OPD devices were measured by the electrochemical workstation (CHI760E) with oscillating frequency from 1 Hz to 0.1 MHz under the dark conditions. As shown in Fig. 7(a), the equivalent circuit of the devices was included, which consisted of a series resistor (Rs) with a set of capacitors (C) and a shunt resistance (Rsh) in parallel.70 The Nyquist diagram showed a semicircle on the complex plane. The left intercept between the semicircle and the horizontal axis was the internal resistance of the device. The right intercept with the horizontal axis was the sum of the charge transfer resistance and the internal resistance, indicative of the state of charge transfer.71 It was observed that the Rs values of the p- and m-ZnO based devices were similar, but the Rsh value of the ZnO/EG based devices was much larger than that of p-ZnO based devices, and the Rsh of the devices based on ZnO/EDT was much smaller than that of p-ZnO based devices. The Rsh of ZnO/EG based devices was increased by the alcohol modification, thus reducing the JD. Moreover, the Mott–Schottky curve was measured by the Paios. The characteristics of capacitance and bias were investigated in order to further elaborate the reason for the JD decline of ZnO/EG based OPDs devices, as shown in Fig. 7(b). The doping density is calculated by the following equation,13,72 (5)where NA is the doping density, ε0 is the dielectric constant of vacuum (8.85 × 10−14 F cm−1), εr is the relative dielectric constant of the PTB7-Th:PC61BM medium (assuming εr = 3), q is the unit charge (1.6 × 10−19 C), k is the slope of the linear part of the Mott–Schottky curve. To simplify the model, it was assumed that ZnO was part of the cathode. The total depletion layer width (Wdepletion) is calculated by the following equation,73 (6)where XBHJ is the depletion width of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) layer, Vbi is the internal potential, which is the intersection of the linear part of the Mott–Schottky curve with the X-axis. Table 2 summarizes the parameters analyzed by Mott–Schottky.

As shown in Table 2, the number of defects in the active layer with the surface modification was not reduced for the ZnO/EDT based device. The charge doping density (5.1 × 1016 cm−3) of ZnO/EDT devices increased by 34.2% compared with p-ZnO devices, and the Wdepletion (85 nm) was dropped by 15.0%. The charge doping density of ZnO/EG based devices was 1.5 × 1016 cm−3 under the dark conditions, which was lower than that of p-ZnO based devices (3.8 × 1016 cm−3), thus reducing the JD of ZnO/EG based devices. In addition, under zero bias, the ZnO/EG based devices had a larger Wdepletion (150 nm), which made the photon separation more efficient, and the depletion in the active layer more obvious.13,74
Linear dynamic range
Linear dynamic range (LDR) is an important parameter characterizing the light intensity range of the linear response of photodetectors, which can be calculated by the following equation,75–78 (7)where Jmax is the saturated photocurrent and Jmin is the lowest detectable photocurrent. When the light intensity exceeds the saturated photocurrent, the photocurrent starts to deviate from the linear region. When the light intensity is lower than Jmin, the photocurrent begins to deviate from the linear region.
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of ZnO/EG based devices using LED white lighting under different light intensity was measured by the Paios. As shown in Fig. 8(a), when the light intensity increased from 1.33 nW cm−2 to 0.1 W cm−2, the photocurrent under −0.1 V bias increased from 4.98 × 10−9 A cm−2 to 1.15 × 10−2 A cm−2. The J–V curves exhibited unsymmetric patterns under weak light signal, and became gradually symmetric when the light intensity increased. As shown in Fig. 8(b), the calculated LDR of 138 dB of the ZnO/EG based device was higher than that of p-ZnO based devices (116 dB). The LDR for ZnO/EDT and ZnO/PDO based OPDs were 124 dB and 129 dB, respectively, as shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†). The LDR of p- and m-ZnO based OPDs devices were comparable to that of the recently reported fullerene-based OPDs (>120 dB),23 and inorganic photodetector InGaAs (132 dB).39 The high LDR means the good ability of the detection of weak light signal, indicative of potential application in health detection. Due to the limitation of the light sources used in this work, the LDR may be underestimated.

Response speed
The pulse laser with optical intensity of 50 Mw was used to irradiate OPDs at the pulse frequency of 50 kHz. The output current signal was converted to the voltage signal through charge amplifier to the oscilloscope. Transient photocurrent (TPC) curves of different devices under −0.1 V bias were measured, as shown in Fig. 9. The response speed is defined as the rise time (tr) from 10% to 90% of the maximum electrical signal and the fall time (tf) from 90% to 10% of the maximum electrical signal.79–82 When the laser source was turned on, the photocurrent increased abruptly and then gradually became stable. When the light source was turned off, the photocurrent rapidly decayed exponentially to zero. It could be observed that the TPC curves of the m-ZnO based device was closer to the square wave, while the TPC curve of the p-ZnO based device had an obvious protruded peak. It is generally known that the existence of the peak is due to the process of the internal charge caught by the trap,83,84 which is consistent with the more traps in the unmodified p-ZnO device. The total time of the response (Tr) was determined by the following equation, (8)where ttr is the carrier transit time constant, tdif is the carrier diffusion time constant, and tRC stands for the RC time constant. According to the simple equivalent circuit, resistance (R) is related to Rs and Rsh. Obviously, the R will decrease with the decrease of RS, which will lead to a shorting of the tRC.15 The RS of p- and m-ZnO based devices were obtained by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. It was found that the RS values of m-ZnO based devices was much lower than that of p-ZnO based devices. Compared to p-ZnO based devices, the RS values of ZnO/EG based devices decreased from 114 Ω to 39.8 Ω, and the decrease were nearly one third. The reduction of series resistance after alcohol modification means that devices have better interface contact and faster electron transmission. The tr and tf of ZnO/EG based devices were 1.0 μs and 1.6 μs, respectively. The fast response speed indicated that the OPD device in this work had great potential in health detection.

Conclusion
In this work, the effects of morphological and interfacial modification on the performance of an inverted organic photodetector device based on PTB7-Th:PC61BM are deeply investigated. The morphology of the active layer deposited from chlorobenzene solution was modified to simultaneously increase EQE and reduce JD. The optimized pristine ZnO based OPD device showed a JD of 1.12 × 10−7 A cm−2, an EQE of 72.2%, and a D* of 2.25 × 1012 Jones at 730 nm under −0.1 V bias. In order to further improve the EQE and reduce the JD, the interfacial modification on ZnO with different alcohols was investigated. The hole injection barrier was increased by the alcohol interfacial modification on ZnO to suppress JD. The amount of defects in the active layer of modified ZnO based devices was suppressed to reduce leakage current. Compared to the p-ZnO based OPD, ZnO/EG based OPDs had a lower JD of 7.85 × 10−9 A cm−2, much larger Rsh of 2.18 MΩ, and much lower charge doping density of 1.5 × 1016 cm−3 under dark conditions. The inverted OPD exhibited a high specific detectivity of 9.11 × 1012 Jones, a wide linear dynamic range of 138 dB, and a fast response speed as low as 1 μs, and showed potential for health monitoring applications. The study of OPDs used for photoplethysmography measurement is ongoing. In order to have a better practical application, OPDs should be packaged to avoid the damage of the electrode caused by the fixture when measuring the heart rate, and flexible OPDs should be fabricated to fit the skin for measurement.
