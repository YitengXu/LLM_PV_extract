    , Accepted 8th December 2021First published on 8th December 2021AbstractFirst principles calculations were performed to investigate the photocatalytic behavior of 2D Janus monolayer HfSO at equilibrium and under the influence of strains and external electric fields. A thorough investigation of the structural, electrical, and optical properties of HfS2, HfO2, and HfSO was also provided. In 1T configuration, the three 2D Janus monolayers were found to be dynamically and thermally stable. The phonon dispersion of strained HfSO demonstrates the material's dynamical stability. The Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of 1T HfSO reveal isotropic elastic characteristics on the x–y plane as well as HfSO's tendency to expand transversally under compressive strains. The three monolayers HfS2, HfO2, and HfSO have appropriate band gaps for redox reaction activation, and the corresponding band gaps are 2.48 eV, 6.50 eV, and 2.98 eV. Furthermore, the extremely anisotropic mobility of electrons and holes on the x–y plane benefits the electron–hole separation process. The equilibrium HfSO has a moderate absorption rate of 5 × 105 cm−1 in the visible range, with the intensity increasing by around 20% with a −6% biaxial strain. Consequently, the absorption range is moved to a lower energy level, covering the majority of visible regions. The 2D Janus HfSO's asymmetric surface electrical characteristic is also discovered. As a result, HfSO is suggested to be a very promising material for application in optoelectronic devices, as well as photovoltaic and water-splitting catalysts, which can be greatly enhanced by appropriate stresses.
1 Introduction
Innovative materials have evolved as key components in a wide range of technical solutions as a result of the rapid growth of high technologies and increased energy consumption. To meet the demand for better materials, rigorous research has led to the exploration of many promising materials, including oxides, nitrides, 2D transition metal chalcogenides MoX2 (X = S, Se), MXenes, and graphitic carbon nitride.1,2 Many 2D Janus transition metal chalcogenides, in particular Te2Se, SbSn2Bi, SbTeI, XSn2Y (X, Y = P, As, Sb, and Bi; X ≠ Y), and TiXY (X ≠ Y, X/Y = Cl, Br, I), involve asymmetric surface characteristics3–5 that cause piezoelectricity and Rashba effects.6–11 Two-dimensional Janus, including monolayers and multilayers, can theoretically exhibit excellent catalytic capabilities as well as in-plane and out-of-plane polarization.12–19 2D Janus transition metal chalcogenides have recently been found to be promising materials for water-splitting photocatalysts20–22 due to their unique properties such as adequate band structures, good electron–hole separation rate, asymmetric face characteristics, and intrinsic built-in electric dipole. The monolayer WSSe, PtSSe, and heterostructure WSeTe/WSTe and MoSeTe/WSTe have shown tremendous promise for use in water-splitting, photovoltaic, and piezoelectric applications,20,23,24 1T-MX2 (M = Zr and Hf; X = S, Se, and Te).25 Other 2D Janus materials, such as Janus MXY monolayers (M = Pd, Pt; X/Y = S, Se, Te) have promising prospects for thermoelectric applications.26 The 2D Janus materials also have a significant advantage in that their structural and electrical properties can be easily modified by external electric fields and strains.27–29
Despite the existence of a large range of 2D photocatalysts that have been theoretically and experimentally demonstrated to be outstanding, such as g-C3N4, PdSeO3, covalent organic compounds, BN, phosphorene, and dichalcogenides,30–36 the search for new photocatalysts continues.37,38 Recently, it was discovered that the 1T configuration of the 2D HfS2 is one of the few photocatalysts capable of absorbing photons in the visible range,39 whereas the 1T HfO2 has an asymmetric surface electronic characteristic with a wide band gap.40,41 The benefits of both HfS2 and HfO2 can be combined in a new 2D Janus monolayer HfSO by replacing one S-layer in HfS2 by an O-layer, a method similar to the successful synthesis of MoSSe,42,43 which shows a significant improvement in water-splitting ability as well as absorption over a wider wavelength range. To the best of our knowledge, research on HfSO monolayers has been confined,3,44 and only partly presents the materials’ electrical, optical, and water-splitting abilities. The photocatalytic capacity of a HfSO monolayer under the impact of stresses and external electric fields was investigated for the first time in this study using a systematic investigation of structural, electronic, and optical features. To improve the reliability of computing results, both the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)45 and the hybrid functional HSE06 methods46 were used for first-principles calculations.
2 Methodology
The first-principles calculation was performed by using the VASP code,47 where the project augmented wave approach (PAW) was applied to describe the interaction between Hf, O, and S cores and with valence electrons of Hf-5d3, Hf-6s1, S-3s2, S-3p4, O-2s2, and O-2p4 orbitals. The exchange–correlation interaction was treated by functionals proposed by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)45 function within generalized gradient approximation and by the hybrid functionals HSE0646 to improve the reliability of HfSO band structure with strong correlations between Hf-5d3 orbitals. The DFT-D3 semi-empirical potential was used in the calculation framework to account for weak forces between atomic planes.48 The plane wave basis set is limited by an energy cut off of 500 eV. The smearing value was set to be 0.05 in the Gaussian smearing method. The Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh of 16 × 16 × 1 was set up with the gamma-point at the center. The distance along the z-axis between HfSO layers was set to be 30 Å to avoid inter-layer interaction. The convergence was controlled by a total energy less than 1 meV, the force acting on an ion was within 0.01 eV Å−1, and the electron energy was lower than 1 × 10−4 eV. The phonon dispersion was calculated by setting a 4 × 4 × 1 supercell, employing the PHONOPY package together with the finite displacement method in VASP.49
3 Geometric structure and stability of the monolayers
The HfS2, HfO2, and HfSO compounds in 2D polymorphisms share common structural properties of the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with the general formula MXY (M = Ti, Zr, Hf; X and Y are two chalcogens). Due to strong in-plane covalent bonding, these TMDs crystallize in buckling tetragonal (T), hexagonal (H), or rhombohedral (R) layers.50–54 While HfS2 and HfO2 have been successfully synthesized in experiments and even on commercial scales,55–57 HfSO has just been discovered by a limited number of theoretical studies.44,58 Therefore, the Janus HfSO structure was simulated based on the HfS2 structure, where one of the two equivalent sulfur sublayers is substituted by one oxygen sublayer. The optimized structure of Janus HfSO, as shown in Fig. 1(a and b), shares a common feature of the conventional 2D TMDs43,59 which includes one plane of metal atom (Hf) sandwiched between two planes of chalcogen elements (oxygen and sulfur). However, the difference in electronegativities between the top and the bottom atoms leads to an intrinsic dipole moment inside the crystal which breaks the mirror symmetry of conventional TMDs structures. Therefore, the structure of Janus HfSO belongs to the space group P3m1 with breaking of the inversion symmetry (C13v, no. 156). The structural parameters of the optimized 1T HfSO is presented in Table 1.

Due to the splitting of d orbitals, each Hf atom in Janus HfSO can bond to three equivalent chalcogen atoms (O or S) to form trigonal prismatic geometry,60 which is found to be one of the most stable phases of 2D Janus HfS2 and HfO2.40,61 Therefore, it is expected that Janus HfSO inherits the 1T structure of HfS2 and HfO2. The lattice constant of the 1T structure of HfSO, as shown in Table 1, was estimated to be 3.417 Å, which is well consistent with previous theoretical studies.3,44 The Hf–S and Hf–O bond lengths are 2.53 Å, and 2.146 Å, respectively. The optimal bond length dHf–X equals the sum of the ionic radii of 0.85 Å for the Hf4+ cation and 1.40 Å and 1.84 Å for X2− anions (X = O, S),58 indicating that a p–d hybridized ionic bond is present in these Hf-based monolayers rather than a sp2 hybridized covalent bond as in graphene. The electron localization function (ELF) of the HfSO monolayer is illustrated in Fig. 1(e), where the fully localized electron (1.0) is denoted by the red region, the fully delocalized electron (0.5) is presented by the green region, and the blue region (0.0) is where there is very little electron density. The red region mostly concentrated on the S and O atoms indicating strong localization of electrons around these atoms. Meanwhile, a significant distribution of delocalized electrons is also observed based on the green areas connecting the Hf atoms with S atoms or with O atoms. Therefore, the 2D Janus HfSO is characterized by the mix of ionic and covalent bonding natures. This ionic–covalent bonding nature has also been observed in other 2D Janus materials such as Cr2I3X3 (X = Br, Cl) and 1T-MX2 (M = Zr and Hf; X = S, Se, and Te).25,62
Because the 2D polymorphism of HfSO has only been predicted by a limited number of theoretical studies,44,58 it is necessary to study its dynamical stability by means of phonon calculation and in comparison with HfS2 and HfO2, which have been well studied.40,63,64 Besides, the stability of strained Janus HfSO was also studied. The phonon dispersions of the five structures including HfS2, HfO2, HfSO, compressed HfSO at −8%, and tensile HfSO at +8%, as presented in Fig. 2, were calculated along the lines connecting highly symmetric points Γ, M, and K in the Brillouin zone. A unit cell consisting of three atoms was used to simulate the crystal, so there are 9 phonon branches in each phonon dispersion diagram. The absence of negative phonon branches confirms the dynamical stability of all three compounds. Comparing the phonon dispersion of the three compounds, it can be seen that HfSO is even more thermally stable than HfS2. Actually, the slope of the acoustic branches, i.e., group velocity, in HfSO is higher than the ones in HfS2 but lower than the case of HfO2. Due to the direct proportion between the group velocity, the elastic modulus, and the melting point, it is reasonable to suggest that the elastic modulus, and melting point of HfSO are in the range between the corresponding values of HfS2 and HfO2. It is interesting to acknowledge that the slope of the acoustic branches of HfSO is remarkably enhanced by compressive strain, while the tensile strain tends to decrease this value. As the propagation speed of the optical phonons is close to zero, they do not contribute to heat conduction. Therefore, the HfSO monolayer with higher phonon group velocity is expected to possess better thermal conductivity than HfS2 does.

The interaction of the dipole moment with electromagnetic waves characterizes optical phonons. The greater the difference between the atoms' electronegativities, the lower the frequencies necessary for the oscillation to create optical phonons. As a result, the prohibited frequency range between the optical and acoustic phonons can describe the atomic bonding's ionic nature. This forbidden frequency range expands as it moves from HfS2 to HfSO and HfO2. Compared to HfS2 and HfO2, this order indicates that HfSO has medium ionic bonding. Furthermore, because there is no connection between the low-lying optical and acoustic phonons, heat-carrying by acoustic branches is not scattered, resulting in higher thermal conductivities65,66 in all five structures.
The thermal stability of Janus HfSO is demonstrated using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) computation in which the atomic configuration is set up with atoms based on the optimal 1T lattice structure and heated at 300 K for 6 ps. It is discovered that the system's temperature, shown in Fig. 3(b), changes harmonically with approximately the same period of 1 ps. The overall energy very minimally oscillates about −26.25 eV within this temperature changing barrier. These findings suggest that the Janus HfSO 1T structure is stable at ambient temperature. The heating at 300 K causes some local minimum energies corresponding to minor structural changes, but the system always returns to the initial 1T configuration. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the Janus HfSO retains the same structural characteristics with no lattice defects after heating at 300 K for 6 ps.

Moreover, the mechanical strength of the 2D Janus HfSO was also evaluated based on the Young's modulus Y(θ) and Poisson's ratio ν(θ) which were determined as functions of the in-plane angle θ between the applied strain direction and the lattice vector67 as follows: (1) (2)where α = (C11C22 − C122)/C66 − 2C12 and β = C11 + C22 − (C11C22 − C122)/C66. Despite the structural anisotropy along the z-axis, HfSO is symmetrical on the x–y plane with a hexagonal structure, therefore the polar diagrams of its Young's modulus Y(θ) and Poisson's ratio ν(θ) are in the shape of circles, as shown in Fig. 4. Such angular independence of Young's modulus and Poison's ratio has also been observed in other 2D structures such as the Janus SnSSe monolayer, graphene, and square-octagon MoS2.68–71 The Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of HfSO were estimated to be 128.822 N m−1 and 0.236, respectively. In comparison with HfS2, whose Young's modulus is 136.82 N m−1 and Poisson's ratio is 0.19,72 the 2D Janus HfSO is softer and less brittle. The Poisson's ratio of HfSO is close to the ones of other 2D monolayer AlSb, InSb, SnS2, SnSO, and SnO2 which are about 0.2 to 0.3.73,74 The Poisson's ratio of 0.236 indicates the tendency of monolayer HfSO to expand in the transversal direction to the compression.

4 Electronic properties
Since the three Janus monolayers HfS2, HfO2, and HfSO share the 1T structure, their band structures were computed along the same highly symmetrical path Γ(0.0 0.0 0.0), M(0.5 0.0 0.0), and K(0.333 0.333 0.0) in the first Brillouin zone. The Fermi energy level was chosen to be located at the top of the valence band. The GGA calculation reveals a HfS2 band gap of 1.36 eV, which is close to previous studies.39,75 At the same time, the HSE06 approach gives a higher HfS2 band gap of 2.48 eV which is in good agreement with the experimental value of 2.85 eV of ultra-thin HfS2 measured by Traving et al.76 Therefore, the results obtained using the HSE06 approach were used in further discussion of the electronic properties of the three semiconductors. It is found that the band gap of HfO2 is about 6.5 eV, slightly higher than the value of 5.2 eV in a previous theoretical study.40 However, these values are well consistent with the band gap of thin-film HfO2 which varies from 4.3 eV to 6.5 eV depending on the capped materials.55 The band gap of HfSO has not been clearly stated, it is somewhere between 0.9 eV and 2.88 eV.3,44 Meanwhile, the current study predicts a HfSO band gap of about 2.98 eV, which is a reasonable value as it is higher than the band gap of HfS2 and lower than the one of HfO2.
In general, both GGA and HSE06 simulations predict indirect band gaps for HfS2, HfO2, and HfSO monolayers (Fig. 5 and 6). In the three separate monolayers, the conduction lowest band, which is mostly contributed by the Hf-d orbitals, remains at the M-point. The valence highest band, which is primarily composed of S-p or O-p orbitals, is shifted from the Γ-point in HfS2 to the midpoint of the K–Γ path in HfO2. Because the valence highest band of HfSO is located at the Γ-point, the S-p orbitals are expected to dominate this band.

 Fig. 6  (a) Band diagrams and corresponding PDOS and (b) weighted band structures of the HfSO monolayer. 
The HfS2 band structure covers the energy range of −6 to 6 eV, with the principal distribution originating from S-p orbitals in the valence band (VB) and Hf-d orbitals in the conduction band (CB) (Fig. 5(a)). The valence band maximum (VBM) ranges from −2.5 to 0 eV and is created by the hybridization of S-p and Hf-p orbitals, with the latter having the lowest density. The overlapping Hf-s, Hf-p, and S-p orbitals form the VB's lowest region. While Hf-d orbitals dominate the conduction band minimum (CBM), Hf-d orbitals dominate the higher state with a slight contribution from Hf-s orbitals.
The band structure of HfO2 is similar to that of HfS2, with O-p orbitals dominating the VB and Hf-d orbitals distributing the majority of the CB (Fig. 5(b)). The sole difference is that the VB of HfO2 is composed of more states, including the O-p, Hf-d, Hf-p, and O-s orbitals. The novel monolayer HfSO inherits unique features from both the HfS2 and HfO2 band structures by replacing one S atom in the HfS2 monolayer with an O atom. The broad VBM peak resembles HfS2, which is dominated by S-p orbitals. The O-p orbitals, like the VBM of HfO2, produce three significant peaks at lower valence bands ranging from −6 to −4 eV. The Hf-d orbitals continue to dominate the conduction bands. When compared to the conduction bands of HfO2, the addition of one S atom in the HfSO monolayer reduces the conduction bands by roughly 3 eV. The hybridization of the two low-density S-p and O-p orbitals with Hf-d orbitals yields three prominent peaks at the CBM and higher CB states. It should be noted that the hybridization of specific orbitals corresponds to a specific HfSO VB peak. The double peak near −2 eV is largely formed by S-s and S-p orbitals, whereas at −3 eV, O-p orbitals, along with S-p and Hf-p orbitals, begin to contribute considerably to the formation of the VB sharp peak. At lower energy levels, from −6 to −4 eV, O-p orbitals contribute the vast bulk of the distribution, with a minor contribution from Hf-p orbitals, resulting in three strong and distinct VB peaks.
Each of the three atoms Hf, S, and O has two unpaired electrons in the 5d, 3p, and 2p subshells. Because Hf has the lowest electronegativity of the three elements, it transfers electrons to the bonds. When Hf and S atoms are combined, the overlap of Hf-d and S-p orbitals is strong at the highest valence bands of −3 to 0 eV, as seen in Fig. 5(a). This strong overlap increases the dispersion of these bands, and as a result, the energy gap between the intrinsic energy levels of constituent atoms is narrowed to a much smaller band gap of HfS2 in comparison to the one of HfO2, where the Hf-d and O-p orbital overlap is clearly less strong at energy levels ranging from −2 to 0 eV, as shown in Fig. 5(b). The monolayer HfSO, which inherits the properties of both HfS2 and HfO2, has a considerable overlap between S-p and O-p with Hf-d, resulting in valence highest band dispersion and high peaks at lower valence bands as well as conduction bands (Fig. 6). These properties make the HfSO monolayer a very promising candidate for use in electronic and photoelectronic devices.
5 Effect of biaxial strain engineering and electric field on the electronic and optical properties of the Janus HfSO monolayer
One of the advantages of a 2D material is that its band gap can be effectively tuned by applying strains and an external electric field.73,77–81 In the case of InSe monolayers, the band gap can even be converted between direct and indirect depending on the external electric field.82 The band structure of the HfSO monolayer under biaxial strain and external electric field is shown in Fig. 7 and 8, where the biaxial strains are in the range of −8% to 8%, and the electric field is set to be −4 V nm−1 to 4 V nm−1.
 Fig. 7  Band structure of the HfSO monolayer under a biaxial strain from −8% to 8%. 
 Fig. 8  Band structure of the HfSO monolayer under the influence of an external electric field intensity from −4 V nm−1 to 4 V nm−1. 
Strains can significantly affect the Hamiltonian function for the HfSO monolayer via the symmetry reduction.83 Therefore, the band structure is expected to noticeably change under strain with different rates. It can be seen in Fig. 7 that the band gap of HfSO decreases strongly as the compression increases from −2% to −6%, and especially at −8% the shrunk HfSO possesses metallic properties where the conduction bands are shifted to an energy level lower than the Fermi level. On the other hand, the tensile strains from 2% to 6% cause very little change in the band gap. Only when the tensile strain reaches 8%, the band gap is decreased by about 0.5 eV. It can be suggested that under the compression, the atoms of HfSO are shifted closer to each other and cause orbital splitting and overlap. This results in narrowing the band gap. While tensile strains do not induce these processes. It is worth noticing that the compression also significantly enhances the dispersion of the valence band near the Γ point. On the contrary to the strong effect of strain on the band structure of the HfSO monolayer, the external electric fields of −4 to 4 V nm−1 cause unnoticeable changes to the band structure of HfSO (Fig. 8). As can be seen in Fig. 9, the HfSO band gap, as a function of strain, increases quickly from 0 to 1.5 eV when strain is modified from −8% to −4%. Further decreasing the compressive strains causes less band gap increase. The tensile strains enlarge the band gap by some eV which then decreases as tensile strain reaches 8%. Meanwhile, the band gap is likely to not depend on the external electric fields.
 Fig. 9  Variation in the HfSO band gap under the influences of biaxial strain from −8% to 8% (blue line), and of external electric field intensity from −4 V nm−1 to 4 V nm−1. 
As considered above, both HfS2 and HfO2 are very promising materials for photoelectric application while HfSO not only inherits the perspective properties of HfS2 and HfO2 monolayers but also seems to be an improvement due to its special electric properties. It is worthy of notice that photoelectric properties are determined by dielectric function which in turn is strongly related to the electronic feature of a material. Therefore, it is expected that strain also causes significant changes to the optical properties of HfSO. The Kramers–Kronig relation84 is used to derive the real ε1(ω) and imaginary ε2(ω) components of the dielectric function ε(ω), then the absorption coefficient α(ω) is calculated using the dielectric function matrix value.
The dielectric constant ε as a function of propagating wave ω for the equilibrium HfSO monolayer is depicted by the blue curve in Fig. 10, which is characterized by a static dielectric constant ε1(0) of about 2.9. Under the effect from most of the strains and external electric fields, this value varies only by some tenth orders of magnitude Fig. 10(b). It is worth noticing that under a compression of −6%, the static dielectric constant increases dramatically by about 1 unit to reach the value of about 4.2, indicating a higher rate of charge polarization in HfSO monolayers. Moreover, at this compression, the highest peak of the real dielectric component ε1(ω) is shifted from 2.4 eV to a lower energy level of 1.8 eV, where the intensity is boosted by about 30% (Fig. 10(a)). This higher dielectric constant is advantageous for organic solar cell devices because it reduces the Coulomb force between loosely bonded electron–hole pairs on charge transfer states, increasing exciton dissociation processes, suppressing loss due to bimolecular recombination, and increasing the photocurrent and photovoltage.85 At energy levels higher than 2.4 eV, the intensity of the real component ε1(ω) nearly stays the same, where the second highest peak is shifted to higher energy levels.
 Fig. 10  Real component of dielectric function for HfSO monolayers under (a) biaxial strain and (b) an external electric field, and imaginary component under (c) biaxial strain and (d) external electric field. 
The imaginary component ε2(ω) of the dielectric function ε(ω) for the HfSO monolayer at equilibrium consists of two main peaks in the vicinity of 3 eV and 5.8 eV (Fig. 10(c)). These two high peaks signify that the HfSO monolayer mostly absorbs photons with an energy close to 3 eV and 5.8 eV to successfully excite the electron on the S-p and O-p orbitals of the valence bands to the Hf-d orbitals of the conduction bands, shown in Fig. 6. The compressive strain of −6% causes an amazing improvement in the HfSO monolayer in terms of photoelectric applications. This compressed monolayer can mostly absorb photons in the visible range with an enhanced intensity by about 40% in comparison with the unstrained structure. In contrast to the influence of strains, external electric fields have a small effect on the dielectric function. As shown in Fig. 10(b and d), a negative electric field of −4 V nm−1 generates a slight increase in ε1(ω) and ε2(ω). Positive electric fields, on the other hand, reduce the intensity of the dielectric functions. The absorption ability of the HfSO monolayer is depicted in more detail by the absorption rate α(ω) in Fig. 11.
 Fig. 11  Absorption rate of HfSO monolayers (a) under biaxial strain and (b) an external electric field. 
The absorption edge of equilibrium HfSO is located at energy levels lower than 2 eV, which is an outstanding property for photoelectric materials due to the ability to absorb most of the photons in the visible ranges which contribute a major part to the solar radiation. The absorption rate α(ω) increases exponentially to its first maximum of 5 × 105 cm−1 at energy levels near 3 eV before a constant rate of about 4 × 105 cm−1 in the range 4–8 eV (Fig. 11). The absorption reaches its extremely high rate for photons of about 8 eV, where the intensity is about 12 × 105 cm−1. As shown in Fig. 11(a), except for the compressive strain of −2%, most of the strains allow HfSO to absorb photons with a lower energy, however with nearly unchanged intensity. The strain of −6% not only matches the absorption ability of the strained HfSO monolayer to the visible wavelengths, but it also boosts the absorption rate by around 20%. At low energy levels, the influence of external electric fields on the absorption rate α(ω) (Fig. 11(b)) is negligible. However, at higher energy levels, there are specific ranges such as 5–6 eV and 9–10 eV where negative electric fields somewhat lower the absorption rate α(ω) and positive electric fields cause slight improvement.
6 Novel Janus HfSO monolayers as a water splitting photocatalyst
Monolayers of HfS2 and HfO2 have been extensively studied as potential replacement materials for existing materials in electronic, photovoltaic, photocatalyst, and field effect transistor applications where one of the most critical prerequisites is an appropriate work function.39,86,87 As a result, several research attempts have been conducted in order to adjust the work function of these materials.88–90 In this regard, the work function of HfSO, which is investigated for the first time in this paper, is of great interest. The work function ϕ is defined as the least energy required to transfer an electron from a surface to the vacuum, and it is given by the difference in electrostatic potential between of vacuum EV and the Fermi level EF: ϕ = EV − EF. The planar average electrostatic potential along the normal direction z of a HfSO monolayer is presented in Fig. 12, based on which the work function is depicted for both oxygen and sulfur planes.
 Fig. 12  Work function of Janus HfSO monolayers. 
In contrast to HfS2 and HfO2 monolayers, which have the same work function at both surfaces,39,91 the asymmetric electronic structure of HfSO monolayers result in different work functions at different surfaces. The calculated work function at the sulfur plane of 6.363 eV is comparable to that of HfS2 in its heterostructure with metals.88,92 Meanwhile, the oxygen plane work function is 4.6 eV, which is close to the work function of HfO2 in its stacking structure with other materials.39,91 The work function of a solid is well known to be generated from the dipole barrier on its surface, which is created by an electronic distribution difference between the inner layers and the surface. In the case of 2D materials, the disruption of pz orbitals is important in establishing the amplitude of this physical property.93 As demonstrated in Fig. 12, the S-p orbitals occupy higher valence bands than the O-p orbitals. This can result in a potential drop of about 1.763 eV in the normal direction. Because device manufacturing is frequently done by vertical stacking 2D materials to adjust the work function,94–96 the anisotropic work function along the normal direction of the HfSO monolayer offers various application advantages. In fact, various 2D transition metal dichalcogenides with vertically oriented layers have been synthesized to improve gas adsorption for sensors, photocatalysts, and field emission. Simply changing the orientation of a single 2D MoS2 nanoribbon changes the work function by up to 0.89 eV. HfSO has lower computed work functions at both surfaces compared with GaS and CdS compounds,97,98 indicating that it has better photocatalytic activity. It is worth mentioning that a photocatalyst's work function is inversely related to its catalytic activity. For example, adjusting the work function of graphene by 0.5 eV can improve the solar power conversion efficiency by 40 times,99 and a reduction in the work function of MoS2 monolayers by 0.43 eV can enhance the quality of the homojunction diode.100
The photocatalytic capacity of the three monolayers HfSO, HfS2, and HfO2 is investigated further by analyzing the relative energy levels of the conduction band minima (CBMs) and valence band maxima (VBMs) with the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), which may be calculated using the following formulas:101 ECB = χC − EC − 0.5Eg(3) EVB = ECB + Eg(4)where the free electron energy EC estimated in the hydrogen scale is 4.5 eV, the electronegativity of each monolayer χC is the geometric mean of all constituent atoms, and Eg is the band gap.
The results shown in Fig. 13 indicate that HfSO, HfO2, and HfS2 are good candidates to be applied as water-splitting photocatalysts. While the valence and conduction bands of the three monolayers are positioned at energy levels favorable for activating the redox reactions which generate hydrogen and oxygen gases, the small band of HfSO is an advantage. The estimated band gap of HfSO in this study is about 2.98 eV which is higher than 1.23 eV, the minimum energy of photon required to stimulate an electron from valence bands to conduction bands.102 On the other hand, this band gap width is in the vicinity of the light spectrum allowing HfSO to absorb more solar energy than the two monolayers HfS2 and HfO2 which possess larger band gaps. The efficiency of a water-splitting photocatalyst also depends on the electron–hole recombination rate, and the charge carrier mobility,103 where the electronic structure of the material plays crucial roles. Except for the indirect band gap of about 2.98 eV, HfSO also has a direct band gap of about 3.5 eV with the valence second highest band located at the M-point. Therefore, the electrons, which are excited by photons with an energy of 2.98 eV, need extra energy coming from the lattice phonons to change their momentum before moving to the conduction bands. The electron excited by photons with an energy of 3.5 eV can move by the direct M–M path to conduction bands. The advantage of the indirect conduction band of HfSO is that it requires the interaction between excited electrons and phonons to change the electron's momentum before recombination with holes in the valence bands. Therefore, the recombination rate is expected to be reduced. In comparison with the band structures of HfS2 and HfO2, the valence band maximum of HfSO is more dispersive along the Γ–K and Γ–M direction, Fig. 13, therefore the effective mass is expected to be lower leading to a higher charger carrier mobility in HfSO.

Similar to other transition metal dichalcogenides,80,104 the hybridization of Hf-5d and S-3p or O-2p orbitals (Fig. 13), results in the enhanced dispersion of the valence bands of HfS2 and HfO2 monolayers. For the case of HfSO, this hybridization is even stronger due to the participation of both S-3p and O-2p orbitals at the same time. Consequently, the more dispersive valence bands are formed at different energy levels. These dense overlapping electrons allow the valence band to preferably attract holes and repel electrons, thus enhancing the separation of electron/hole pairs. In general, the 2D Janus HfSO is expected to possess high charge carrier mobility. This is another advantage of HfSO as a potential photon driven water-splitting catalyst. In order to better estimate the charge carrier mobility, the transport properties of HfSO are calculated and discussed in the next section.
7 Transport properties
The deformation potential theory105–108 was applied for the case of 2D Janus HfSO in order to calculate its charge carrier mobility μ2D based on the values of the effective mass m*, the elastic modulus for 2D compounds C2D, and the deformation potential constant Ed. The charge carrier mobility μ2D is expressed as follows: (5)where ℏ, e, and kB are the reduced Planck constant, the elementary charge, and the Boltzmann constant, respectively. The effective mass m* is opposite to the second derivative of energy E(k) with respect to wavenumber k-dependent energy at the VBM/CBM,  is the average of the effective masses, and T = 300 K is the temperature used. (6)
As shown in Table 2, the calculated effective mass m* of both electrons and holes are equivalent in the x- and y-directions. The isotropy of m* on the x–y plane originates from the symmetrical honeycomb structure of HfSO on this plane. On the scale of free electron mass m0, the absolute value of electron effective mass is 41.53m0, which is clearly higher than the absolute value of 0.63m0 of the hole effective mass. This is a reasonable result with respect to Fig. 6(a), where the edges of the valence band are much more dispersive in comparison with the flat conduction band edges. The elastic modulus C2D and deformation energy constant Ed are expressed via the unit cell volume Ω0, differentiation of CBM/VBM energy ΔEedge with respect to the vacuum level, and the total energy E as a function of the uniaxial strains εuni along the x- and y-directions: (7) (8)The dependence of C2D and Ed on uniaxial strain ranging from −1% to +1% is depicted in Fig. 14, and the corresponding values are listed in Table 2. According to formula (6), the charge carrier mobility is proportional to the modulus C2D and opposite to the square of deformation energy constant Ed. Therefore, a higher modulus of 0.5 N m−1 does not give rise to the electron mobility along the x-direction, on the contrary, the reduction of deformation energy magnitude along the y-direction causes a significant increase in electron mobility along this direction which is 5.76 cm2 V−1 s−1 compared to 3.64 cm2 V−1 s−1 along the x-direction. The hole mobility was also observed to be 568.61 cm2 in the x-direction, which is much higher than 60.73 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the y-direction due to an increase of 5.36 eV in the magnitude of deformation energy Ed along the y-direction. The hole mobility was also observed to be much higher in the x-direction than in the y-direction due to an increase of 5.36 eV in the magnitude of deformation energy along the y-direction. In general, the charge carrier mobility of 1T Janus HfSO is close to that of MXY metal transition dichalcogenides (M = Nb, W, Mo; X and Y = Te, Se, and S).109,110 In comparison to few-layer Janus HfS2, the charge carrier calculated in the current study is rather low. The limited value of HfSO μ2D may originate from the scattering effect of longitudinal optical and acoustic phonons.111 It should be noted that the number of layers may also give rise to the mobility of 2D materials.112

8 Conclusion
In this study, the three 2D Janus monolayers HfSO, HfS2, and HfO2 were studied by means of first-principles calculations using the GGA and HSE06 methods. Phonon dispersion analyses were performed to study and confirm the dynamical stability of the three monolayers and strained HfSO. The compressive strain greatly increases the slope of acoustic branches near the Γ-point in the 1T configuration of HfSO, but the tensile strain causes a negligible change in phonon dispersion. This specific phenomenon of 1T HfSO is explained by its Poisson's ratio of 0.236, indicating the tendency of this material to expand transversally to the direction of compression. Based on the value of Young's modulus, it is expected that HfSO is softer and less brittle than HfS2 monolayers. The 2D Janus HfSO has isotropic elastic characteristics on the x–y plane. The band structure and density of states of 1T HfSO were investigated, revealing an indirect band gap of 2.98 eV, with the valence band dominated by S-p and O-p orbitals and the conduction band dominated by Hf-d orbitals. The replacement of one S atom for one O atom results in an advantageous conduction band structure with three separated high peaks at 3 eV, 4.7 eV and 5.8 eV, the two peaks at 3 eV and 5.8 eV playing crucial roles in the transport of excited electrons from the valence bands to conduction bands. HfSO has also been discovered to be a highly promising photocatalyst, capable of initiating both oxidation and reduction reactions to generate hydrogen and oxygen gases. Furthermore, because each surface has a different work function, HfSO can be used in a wide range of photoelectric applications. The charge carrier mobility of 1T HfSO was discovered to be anisotropic on the x–y plane, with electron mobility in the x-direction being greater than in the y-direction and hole mobility in the y-direction being approximately ten times more than in the x-direction. This high anisotropy is advantageous for electron–hole separation. Janus HfSO monolayers have also been found to mostly absorb photons in the visual wavelengths. While external electric fields and some strains cause little changes in the optical characteristics of HfSO, a compressive strain of −6% is shown to significantly improve inner charge polarization, charge carrier mobility, and photovoltage. Furthermore, this strain can allow the HfSO monolayer to interact with additional electromagnetic waves in the visual spectrum, increasing the intensity by 20%. These discoveries provide more information about the structural, electrical, and optical properties of HfSO, as well as the process through which stresses and electric fields alter these properties. It was discovered that the HfSO monolayer is a very excellent material for photoelectric and electrical applications, with a compressive strain of −6% substantially enhancing its advantages.
