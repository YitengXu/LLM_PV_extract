    , Accepted 13th July 2018First published on 14th July 2018AbstractAn electronic cell that possesses synchronously multi-physical properties is of great importance in the applications of multifunctional electronic devices. In this study, an overwhelming coexistence of negative differential resistance (NDR) effect and resistive switching (RS) memory behavior at room temperature was observed based on Ag/Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe)/Mo devices. The long retention time of ∼104 s and high HRS/LRS resistance ratio of ∼215 can be achieved, indicating that our devices possess excellent resistance random access memory (RRAM). Moreover, strong NDR behavior was observed at room temperature, which provides a great potential application in advanced electronic devices. Finally, the combined physical model of conductive filament and Schottky barrier reinstallment is demonstrated to explain the coexistence phenomenon. Thus, in this, study we propose a new strategy for preparing a multifunctional electronic device with multiple physical attributes in the future.
1. Introduction
In the world of globalization and information explosion, advanced information technology and devices, particularly high-performance storage devices, are becoming increasingly important. Memristor, as the fourth element of circuit, was theoretically predicted by L. O. Chua in 19711 and then, Dmitri B. Strukov confirmed the prediction via theoretical derivation in 2008.2 The memristor can switch reversibly between high-resistance states (HRS) and low-resistance states (LRS) under different bias voltages and sweeping directions, which can be maintained for a long time, as long as HRS and LRS are defined as logic “0” and “1”, respectively; thus, the devices can be used to store information.3,4 The memristor has been considered as one of the most promising candidates in the next-generation nonvolatile memory devices owing to its low energy consumption, fast writing/reading speed and high storage density.5 According to the previous reports, three basic models (bipolarity, unipolarity and non-polarity) were devoted to describe the resistive switching (RS) features.6–11 However, coexistence phenomena of polarities make it even more interesting and impressive, for example, co-occurrence of bipolarity and unipolarity phenomenon in ZnO12 and co-occurrence of unipolarity and non-polarity in TiO2.13 Beyond this, the coexistence of RS and negative differential resistance (NDR) has also been observed,14 indicating that more theory needs to be replenished in addition to polarities to describe RS devices.
NDR, first discovered in 1958,15 is a well-known concept in physics devices, which has been found in double-quantum wells, superlattices and one-dimensional systems.16–21 Generally, higher bias voltage corresponds to lager current density. However, the electronics may present abnormal behaviors in special circumstances. The current density decreases with the increase in bias voltage, which is called as NDR. After decades of investigation, NDR has been found in many systems and has been widely applied to resonant tunneling transistors, oscillators, phenalenyl-based molecular devices and multipliers.22–26
Considering the good prospect of memristor and wide application of NDR, further investigation on the coexistence of RS and NDR is anticipated. The coexistence of NDR and RS phenomenon was first observed at 78 K in 1965.27 and then, Matthew D. Pickett found the coexistence phenomenon in a nanoscale metal-oxide–metal system at a much lower temperature of 4 K.28 The organic-based and Cu2S/ZnO core/shell nanowire devices also exhibited the coexistence of RS and NDR at room temperature.27–30 Zhou et al. have observed the coexistence of RS and NDR phenomenon in the Ag/TiOx/F-doped-SnO2 system at room temperature at a relative humidity of 95%.29 Thus far, the stable and reversible coexistence phenomenon of RS and NDR always requires an abnormal environment, such as low temperature or relative humidity, which would limit the practical application of such devices. Thus, developing electrical devices that present stable and reversible coexistence of RS and NDR in general environment would be of great significance.
To date, Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) is one of the most promising light absorber layers for high-efficiency thin-film solar cells; CZTSe solar cells have achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 11.6%.30 CZTSe is a p-type semiconductor material with a band gap of 1.0 eV.31VCu is the dominant defect that contributes p-type conductivity, which can be significantly affected by Cu content.32 According to the previous reports, Cu2+ shows high mobility and reactivity, and the Cu filament can be easily formed for RS applications.33 Thus, we applied a bias on the CZTSe thin film to push the migration of Cu2+ and adjust the band gap, which should be realistic, and at the same time, the Cu conductive filament can be easily formed. Conducting filament and the Schottky junction model have been widely used to explain the RS phenomenon.34–36 However, there are few reports that focus on the synergistic effects of heterojunction and conducting filament model on electrical devices.
In this study, the CZTSe active film with a thickness of ∼300 nm was used to assemble the RS device with the Ag/CZTSe/Mo structure. Furthermore, the coexistence phenomenon of stable and reversible NDR and RS behaviors was observed at room temperature. In order to explain the coexistence phenomenon, a combined action model of conductive filament and Schottky barrier reinstallment is demonstrated.
2. Experiment process
2.1 Fabrication process of the device
A 300 nm Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) thin film was deposited on Mo-covered quartz by a radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering process. A 5 cm-diameter stoichiometric CZTSe ceramic target was used as the sputtering source. High-purity argon (Ar) was used as work gas. The distance between the target and the substrate was 12 cm. The sputtering power was set at 80 W. The pressure of chamber was maintained at 0.6 Pa with a substrate temperature of 200 °C during the sputtering process. Finally, the top electrode of Ag was deposited by a direct-current (DC) sputtering process. The device structure and measurement circuitry is shown in Fig. 1a, and Fig. 1b shows the photograph of the sample.

2.2 Characteristics
The phase structure of the thin film was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, PANalytical X'Pert PRO system, CuKα irradiation, λ = 1.5405 Å) at room temperature. The cross-section morphology of devices was observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, FESEM JOEL 7001, Japan). Chemical compositions of the films were evaluated by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, Inca spectrometer). Electrical measurements were carried out on the electrochemical workstation (CHI-660E) at room temperature. The bias voltage was applied on the top electrode, while the bottom Mo electrode was grounded; the scan rate of the bias voltage was 0.05 V s−1.
3. Results and discussions
The device structure and sample photograph are shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. The corresponding cross-sectional SEM image of the as-prepared device is shown in Fig. 1c, clearly confirming that 300 nm-thick CZTSe was deposited on Mo-covered quartz. Fig. 1d presents the XRD patterns of the CZTSe/Mo films. Two diffraction peaks at 27.1° and 40.4° can be observed, corresponding to (112) planes of kesterite CZTSe phase [JCPDS file: 52-0868] and (110) planes of Mo phase [JCPDS file: 00-052-0868]. Previous reports have illustrated that XRD analysis is not enough to judge the purity of CZTSe because the characteristic diffractions of ZnSe and Cu2SnSe3 are very close to that of CZTSe and hence, it is hard to distinguish.37 Therefore, Raman measurements were carried out to further evaluate the phase purity of the CZTSe film, as shown in Fig. 1e. The two characteristic peaks corresponding to CZTSe phase can be observed, which confirmed the purity of the CZTSe phase. Fig. 1f shows the scanning map of the CZTSe film. The results indicate that Cu, Zn, Sn, and Se are the only elements found in the film without any other impurities, and the four elements are distributed homogeneously. The surface of the CZTSe film showed uniform and dense features; the grain size ranged between 10 and 20 nm and no trace of holes or cracks are observed (shown in Fig. S1, ESI†). Moreover, the inset table presents the atomic ratio of the film and shows slightly Cu-rich feature. Overall, the results indicate that the dense and homogeneous CZTSe film with pure kesterite phase and preferred orientation of (112) was deposited onto the Mo-covered quartz substrate.

Fig. 2 exhibits the electrical measurement results. Fig. 2a shows the I–V curve (200 switching loops) in the linear scale; the coexistence of typical RS and NDR phenomenon with excellent repeatability can be observed. When the voltage increased to a certain value (occurring randomly between 0.6 V and 1.0 V) under a positive voltage polarity, the current dropped sharply, showing a NDR characteristic. In addition, the LRS switched to HRS. Reversing the applied voltage to negative, the current obtained was small and almost unchanged with the increase in voltage at the beginning, and then increased with the increase in voltage. When the voltage was further increased over a certain value (occurring randomly between −1.4 V and −1.0 V), the NDR behavior was observed. The retention of the resistance state is shown in Fig. 2b; the device suffered no significant degradation after 104 s, indicating that the device exhibited excellent non-voltage resistive switching behavior. Fig. 2c shows the distribution of HRS and LRS (200 switching loops). The read voltage is 0.2 V, the black lines are Gaussian fits to the bar chart, σLRS and σHRS are the standard deviations, and μLRS and μHRS are the mean values. The resistance ratio of HRS/LRS was as large as ∼215 and the variation (σ/μ) of the LRS and HRS was 10% and 26%, respectively, indicating excellent RS performance. The stability of VSET and VRESET is crucial to ensure error-free operation.5Fig. 2d shows the distribution of SET voltage and RESET voltage. The SET voltage exhibited a small variation of 2.5% (σ/μ), while the RESET voltage exhibited uniform distribution ranging from 0.6 to 1.0 V. Thus, the stable coexistence of excellent RS and strong NDR behavior at room temperature is observed in the Ag/CZTSe/Mo structure.

To further explain the mechanism of the coexistence phenomenon, the space charge limited conduction (SCLC) model and the Schottky emission model were employed. For the SCLC model, the I–V characteristic curve can be divided into four regions: the double-logarithmic scale, the Ohmic law region (I ∝ V) under a low field, Child's square law region (I ∝ V2), and the current steep increase region (I ∝ Vx, x > 2) under a high field because of the conductive filament formation.36 The SCLC model can be described by eqn (1):38 (1)where J is the current density, V is the bias voltage, d is the CZTSe thickness and m is the fitting index, respectively. When m = 0, the thermally generated free electrons dominate conduction mechanism, indicating the Ohmic law. When the field exceeds the square-law onset voltage, the density of electrode-injected electrons gradually exceeds the equilibrium concentration and dominates the conductivity, indicating Child's square law and m = 1, which can be described by eqn (2):39 (2)where εi is the permittivity, μ is the carrier mobility, and θ is the ratio of free and shallow trapped charge. The Schottky emission model can be described by eqn (3):40,41 (3)where m* is the electron effective mass, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the absolute temperature, h is Planck's constant, E is the electric field, ∅ is the junction barrier height, and ε is the permittivity. When the temperature is fixed, the Schottky emission model can also be described by eqn (4) and (5):41 (4) (5)where β is a constant. Hence, the Schottky emission can be ascertained by the fitting of ln(J) ∝ E1/2.
The typical current–voltage (I–V) characteristic curve of the Ag/CZTSe/Mo device is shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3a shows that the whole loop of the I–V curve is divided into six parts. Fig. 3b shows the plot of log(I)–log(V) for the first section, and the linear fitting shows the slope of 1.04, indicating Ohmic conduction behavior. The conductive filament (CF) dominated Section 1. The device was in LRS, probably indicating that the Cu conductive filament has been formed. Previous reports have demonstrated that Cu2+ shows high mobility and reactivity, and it is easy to form the Cu filament in RS devices; the process can be described by eqn (6):42 Cu2+ → Cu(6)The EDS result indicates that CZTSe is slightly Cu rich, which would accelerate the formation of Cu filaments. Fig. 3c shows the plots of I–V for the second section, and the current dropped sharply as the bias voltage increased to a certain value (0.6–1.0 V), showing the NDR characteristic. The reason is that the filament ruptured because of Joule heating,43,44 and as a result, the device switched from LRS to HRS. Fig. 3d and e exhibit the low-voltage plots of ln(I)–V1/2 under positive and negative bias, corresponding to Sections 3 and 4. The slopes of linear fitting are ∼4.11 and ∼7.19, indicating that Schottky emission dominated the conductive mechanism under low voltage. Hence, the Schottky junction was formed between the two interfaces of Ag/CZTSe and Mo/CZTSe. Fig. 3f shows the plot of log(|I|)–log(|V|) for the fifth section. The linear fits of I–V1.06, I–V5.19, and I–V1.44 are obtained by increasing the voltage. In the first stage (I–V1.06 changed into I–V5.19), SCLC (the formation of Cu conductive filament) may be dominant. On further increasing the bias voltage, the slope decreased to ∼1.44 and subsequently, the NDR phenomenon was observed. Therefore, we assumed that there are some underlying mechanisms that led to the increase in resistance with the increase in bias voltage. Fig. 3g shows the plot of log(I)–log(V) for the sixth section; the slope of linear fitting was ∼1.03, indicating the Ohmic conduction behavior. Cu conductive filaments were formed, and they dominated the conductivity under low-voltage bias, while the NDR phenomenon was observed at relatively high voltage.

The interface effect might affect the NDR behavior significantly. Although the P–N junction was structured between CZTSe and electrode, the coexistence phenomenon was not observed (Fig. S2, ESI†). However, the similar coexistence phenomenon showed up as we changed the top electrodes into different materials (Fig. S3, ESI†). Therefore, the Schottky barrier is crucial to the coexistence phenomenon. Furthermore, we explain the Schottky barrier reinstallment process that leads to the appearance of NDR. Fig. 4a shows the schematic band diagram of the original device and the energy band alignment. The CZTSe is a p-type semiconductor material, whose work function is higher than that of Ag (4.3 eV) and Mo (4.6 eV). Hence, the electrons would defuse into CZTSe and leave holes with positive charges and finally, the depletion region is formed and both directions of the built-in electric field point to CZTSe. While applying a positive voltage on Ag electrode, the direction of external filed is the same as the built-in electric field of Ag/CZTSe and opposite to that of Mo/CZTSe. According to the metal–semiconductor model, the potential difference of depletion can be obtained using eqn (7):45 V = −q(V0 + Ve)(7)where V, V0, and Ve are the total, original and external potential differences, respectively. Clearly, the barrier height would increase as the direction field of built-in field is the same as the direction of the external filed, and the depletion region would be extended and show high resistance. Moreover, if the direction of the built-in field is opposite to the direction of the external filed, the barrier height would decrease and the depletion region would be narrowed, showing low resistance. By applying a positive voltage on Ag electrode (Fig. 4b), the depletion region of Ag/CZTSe would exhibit high resistance (Mo/CZTSe would exhibit low resistance). By applying a positive voltage on Mo electrode (Fig. 4c), the depletion of Ag/CZTSe would exhibit low resistance (Mo/CZTSe would exhibit high resistance). Fig. 4d exhibits a special case: CZTSe is a p-type semiconductor and the VCu defect is the dominant acceptor defect that contributes p-type conductivity, which can be significantly affected by the Cu content.32 Previous reports show that Cu2+ exhibits high mobility.28,33,44 By applying a positive voltage on Mo electrode, the Cu2+ drift along the external electric field and the Cu content near the CZTSe/Mo interface would decrease and the VCu defect concentration would increase. This leads to more significant p-type characteristics of CZTSe, which would increase the Schottky barrier and further extend the depletion; hence, the resistance of the depletion would be further increased. Cu in Cu-rich material shows higher mobility. The EDS result indicated that CZTSe is slightly Cu rich, which would accelerate the formation of Cu conducting filaments and the Schottky barrier reinstallment process.

Fig. 5 exhibits the physical model schematic of the RS and NDR behaviors observed in Ag/CZTSe/Mo. The typical I–V curve has been divided into six sections. The “a-b”, “b-c”, “c-a”, “a-d”, “d-e-f” and “f-a” sections are one of the static states for each section. In the “a-b” section, the depletion between Ag/CZTSe shows high resistance. The content of VCu (near the Ag) increased by a small degree and showed only a slight effect on resistance of depletion, but Cu filament was formed and it dominated the electrical conductivity (Fig. 3b); hence, the device was in LRS. In the “b-c” section, the Cu filament was ruptured because of Joule heating43,44 and the current dropped sharply. The device was switched from LRS into HRS. In the “c-a” section, the positive voltage was applied for a certain period (the sweep time of a-b-c). As a result, more VCu was accumulated near the Ag/CZTSe interface, the barrier height increased, and the resistance of Ag/CZTSe depleted. The Schottky emission dominated the conductive mechanism and the device was in HRS (Fig. 3d). In the “a-d” section, the Schottky emission dominated the conductivity at low voltage (Fig. 3e) and then, the Cu conductive filament was formed and it dominated the conductivity as the voltage was increased. Moreover, VCu accumulated near the interface of CZTSe/Mo gradually, which would increase the barrier height. Also, the depletion is expended (the resistance of depletion increased) with the increasing of applied voltage, indicating the competition of conductivity mechanism is started between filament and depletion (Fig. 3f). In the “d-e-f” section, the resistance in depletion dominated the conductivity, and the rate of increase in current, attributed to the increase in voltage, was slower than the rate of increase in resistance attributed to the increase in voltage. Thus, the NDR phenomenon was observed. In the “f-a” section in Fig. 5, the voltage and the resistance of depletion are small enough, resulting in the Cu filament is begin to dominate the conductivity again, so the device show the Ohmic conductivity.45

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, the overwhelming coexistence of RS memory behavior and NDR behavior at room temperature has been observed in Ag/CZTSe/Mo devices. The device exhibited a long retention time of 104 s and a high HRS/LRS resistance ratio of ∼215, indicating excellent RS memory performance. The RS behavior between HRS and LRS is mainly caused by the formation and rupture of Cu conductive filaments. At the same time, the strong NDR behavior coexisting with RS behavior was also observed at room temperature. The NDR behavior can be attributed to the junction reinstallment caused by the accumulation of VCu in the CZTSe near the CZTSe/Mo interface. The combined action model of conductive filament and Schottky barrier reinstallment is demonstrated to explain the coexistence phenomenon. We report a device and physical model that the RS and NDR can coexist stably and reversibly at room temperature, which would attribute to the application in data storage field.
