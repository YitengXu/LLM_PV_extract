1 Introduction
Recently, materials with perovskite structure have drawn enormous attention as a potential platform for novel energy harvesting and storage technologies. The study of these materials was originally started by G. Rose in 1839, who found a new kind of mineral consisting of calcium titanate in the Ural Mountains, Russia. He named this kind of mineral as “perovskite”, in honor of the Russian mineralogist Lev Alexeievitch Perovsky.1 In general, the perovskite crystal structure is adopted by many oxides that have the chemical formula ABO3, where A is usually an alkaline earth or rare earth element, and B is a 3d, 4d, or 5d transition metal element. The ideal perovskite structure is cubic with space group Pm3m, and it consists of BO6 octahedra connected to each other by corner oxygen. The A-site cations occupy the twelve-fold coordination sites surrounding eight BO6 octahedra as illustrated in Fig. 1(a).
 Fig. 1  (a) The structure model of an ABO3-type perovskite oxide with the origin centered at the A-site ion (left) and the B-site ion (right). (b) Scheme of the various applications of ABO3 materials that are reviewed in this paper. 
In fact, the real perovskite oxides exhibit complex features of chemical composition and crystalline structure. A large number of metallic elements are stable in the perovskite structure if the tolerance factor t is in the range of 0.75–1.0 which is defined by the equation: (1)where RA, RB and RO are the ionic radii of A and B site elements and oxygen, respectively.2 The tolerance factor defines the symmetry of the crystalline building blocks and significantly affects the properties of the particular compound. Due to the ionic radii and electronegativity differences, the perovskite structure gets distorted by the creation of oxygen or cationic vacancies, or changes of the bonding angles of cations and oxygen.3 Hence, various defects and numerous order–disorder crystalline structures exist in the perovskite family and lead to a rich spectrum of functional properties, for example ferroelectricity, piezoelectricity, catalytic activity, and non-stoichiometry related magnetism phenomena.4
Besides, the transition metal elements at the B site could transfer their s electrons to the oxygen ions. The remaining strongly correlated d electrons may induce a huge variation of electronic and magnetic properties such as colossal magnetoresistance, multiferroicity and superconductivity.5–10 In addition, many perovskites host versatile forms of order in their charge, spin and orbital states. When two different electronic orders are facing at an interface, more complex phenomena may emerge, such as a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG), topological insulators (TIs), and anomalous quantum Hall effect (AQHE).11,12 With the technical advances in the atomic-scale synthesis of oxide heterostructures, it became possible to fabricate atomically abrupt artificial superlattices (SLs) with novel states at the interfaces.
Overall, perovskite oxides have huge application potential in a variety of fields due to their unique crystalline and electronic structures. In the past few decades, perovskite oxides became the workhorse of the very strong ferroelectric and ferromagnetic communities. However, reviews on perovskite oxide films and SLs for application in energy harvesting and storage are rare. Here, we review recent research advances and the remaining challenges of perovskite oxide films and SLs in the pathway towards novel forms of energy harvesters and topological quantum devices (Fig. 1(b)). At first, the applications for photocatalysis, water splitting, solar cells and supercapacitors are summarized. Subsequently, the design and fabrication of interface superconductors and TIs based on perovskite SLs are introduced. Finally, an outlook will be given on the perspectives of perovskite oxides in these new fields.
2 ABO3 films for energy harvesting and storage
With climatic changes and environmental pollution becoming serious problems for mankind, access to clean and renewable energy is expected to be a key factor for the sustained development of human society. Solar energy is considered as the ultimate renewable energy source. The most successful technologies of solar energy harvesting are based on the photovoltaic and photocatalytic effects.13 The photocatalytic effect employs semiconductors to absorb sunlight to create charge pairs for realizing water splitting, whereas the photovoltaic effect uses semiconductors to absorb sunlight, i.e. to directly convert solar energy into electricity.14 In this section, we will review the application of ABO3 materials for solar energy harvesting and storage.
2.1 Photocatalytic water splitting with ABO3 materials
The first work of photocatalysis for H2 production using TiO2 under UV light irradiation was reported by Fujishima and Honda in 1972.15 Since then, photocatalytic hydrogen production using semiconductors has attracted more interest in the field of clean energy research. Based on the fundamental principle, semiconductor photocatalysts should meet at least two key requirements for water splitting: (1) the band gap of semiconductors has to be larger than the standard Gibbs free energy change for water splitting into H2 and O2; (2) the conduction band potential should be more negative than that required for water reduction and the valence band potential should be more positive than that necessary for water oxidation.16,17 As a typical perovskite, SrTiO3 (STO) has been studied for photocatalytic water splitting because of its unique chemical and physical properties, such as long lifetime of electron–hole pairs, high chemical and thermal stability, and strong catalytic activity.18
Single crystal wafers of STO have been used for water splitting by Wagner et al. in 1980.19 They observed sustained generation of hydrogen when the STO surface was illuminated by photons with energy above 3.2 eV.19 The STO powder was also used for water splitting as reported by Liu et al.20 They compared several STO powders fabricated by different methods and summarized the influence of particle size, uniformity of components, and extent of particle aggregation on the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen generation.20
In order to reduce the electron–hole recombination rate of STO, Tan et al. synthesized STO core/amorphous SrTiO3−x shell structures.21 Their results indicate that an optimum concentration of oxygen vacancies can improve the charge separation of photogenerated charge carriers and thus provide an enhancement of photocatalytic performance.21 Besides STO, many other perovskite oxides can also be used as photocatalysts to split water for hydrogen generation as listed in Table 1.22–33 However, most of the undoped perovskites have a wide bandgap larger than 3 eV and are thus not able to absorb the visible range of the solar spectrum.

Ion doping is usually considered as an effective method to adjust the electronic structure and with that the band gap of perovskites. A number of dopants such as Zn, Mn, Cr, Ru and Rh have been used to reduce the bandgap of STO from 3.2 eV to 1.9 eV.34–38 For example, Mn-doped STO has a band gap of 2.7 eV and hence could absorb light with wavelength shorter than 460 nm.36 The light absorption of Cr-doped STO was extended to 500 nm, which is in the visible region.37 Rh-doped STO thin films with a band gap of 1.9 eV also show cathodic photocurrent from water splitting under visible light.38 Besides, Zn-doped BaTiO3 (BTO), N-doped NaTaO3 and La-doped KTaO3 have also displayed remarkable improvement in visible-light photocatalytic activity.35,39–41 In addition, ion doping could be employed not only to extend the light response but also to enhance the photocatalytic activity directly. For instance, doping of aliovalent metal cations into STO for the control of the defect structure to enhance photocatalysis was studied by Takata et al.42 They found that substitution of a cation with a lower-valence cation effectively enhanced the photocatalytic activity, while doping of a higher-valence cation led to suppressed photocatalysis.42 Further study was done by Ham et al., who revealed the effects of SrCl2 flux treatments and Al doping on the photocatalytic properties of STO.43 They confirmed that the flux treatment is beneficial to control Al doping and improve the crystallinity and water splitting activity of STO.43 The experimental results of doped perovskite oxides for photocatalytic water splitting are summarized in Table 2.35–40,44–55

Fabricating multi-component composites is another way to enhance the effectivity of ABO3-based photocatalysts. Metals wrapped to the surface of ABO3 are beneficial to the collection of photogenerated electrons and thus to promote photocatalytic H2 production. For instance, Husin et al. reported Ni-loaded LaxNa(1−x)TaO3 particles made by a sol–gel technique.56 Nickel as the nanosized co-catalyst facilitates the separation of electrons and holes generated by the photocatalyst and therefore significantly enhances the hydrogen processing.56 Liu et al. synthesized highly ordered STO nanotube arrays with and without Ag loading by a combination of anodic oxidation, hydrothermal process and photocatalysis.57 The Ag-loaded STO exhibited higher photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production from water splitting under light irradiation.57
Another kind of composites are ABO3-semiconductor heterojunctions which accelerate the separation of photogenerated charge carriers. For example, NiO modified ABO3 is one of the most widely studied photocatalysts for overall water splitting under UV light. Kato et al. prepared NiO-loaded NaTiO3 which exhibits an efficient H2 evolution ability.28 Townsend et al. studied the photocatalytic performance of the NiOx–STO system.58 The interpretation of NiOx–STO as a three component system with a STO light absorber, a Ni proton reduction catalyst and a NiO water oxidation catalyst is supported by their experiments.58 The proposed mechanism, as presented in Fig. 2(a), is related to a charge separation process. When both Ni metal and NiO are present, the effects of electron and hole trapping compensate each other and hence promote the water oxidation reaction.58 Ng et al. prepared a coupled TiO2–STO film by a hydrothermal method and found that the photocatalytic heterostructure increases hydrogen gas production as compared to pristine TiO2 or STO.59 They attributed the enhanced photocatalytic efficiency to the efficient separation of photogenerated charges at the interface of the heterojunction.59

More recently, some studies have shown that it is possible to combine effects such as ferroelectricity and lattice strain with the photocatalytic effect to further enhance the photocatalytic activity. For example, the ferroelectricity of perovskites is beneficial to charge separation. Strain may influence the defect energetics and hence promote the photocatalytic activity of epitaxial perovskite films. Ji et al. used epitaxial ferroelectric (multiferroic) BiFeO3 (BFO) thin films for unassisted photocatalytic water splitting.60 The Bi3+ ion has a 6s2 lone-pair, which results in hybridization of Bi 6p and O 2p states to cause an off-center displacement of Bi3+ toward O2− to induce ferroelectric polarization.61 The conduction and valence band edges of BFO straddle the water redox levels as shown in Fig. 2(b), and hence oxygen and hydrogen are generated on surfaces with different polarization charges. Further theoretical analysis shows that the large switchable ferroelectric polarization modifies the surface catalytic properties to promote evolution of hydrogen and oxygen.60 Li et al. grew epitaxial double perovskite Bi2FeCrO6 (BFCO) multiferroic thin films for visible-light-driven reduction of water to hydrogen.62 A large photocurrent density was obtained when the film was illuminated by a standard solar simulator (AM 1.5G). In addition, the behavior of the photogenerated carriers was strongly influenced by the polarization field. These findings provide a promising approach to improve the photocatalytic performance of ferroelectric perovskites through the manipulation of polarization induced internal fields.62 Song et al. studied the influence of ferroic domains on photoelectrochemical properties of BFO thin films.63 With the crystallographic orientation changing from (001) via (110) to (111), the ferroelastic domains in epitaxial BFO thin films become mono-variant and the spontaneous polarization levels increase. Correspondingly, the band positions in BFO thin films change due to the orientation-dependent spontaneous polarization. As a result, an enhancement of photocurrent density was observed in BFO films with higher spontaneous polarization.63 Huang et al. reported the fabrication of photoelectrodes based on epitaxial BFCO multiferroic thin films for water oxidation.64 Although the photocatalytic properties of the bare BFCO photoanodes can be improved by controlling the ferroelectric polarization state, the photoelectrochemical performance was limited due to the charge recombination in the photoanode. This problem was addressed by the deposition of a NiO layer on the BFCO surface. Finally, both an enhanced photoelectrochemical performance and a reasonable temporal stability were achieved in NiO–BFCO heterojunction-based photoanodes.64
It is important to compare the application of perovskite oxides for water splitting with different structure systems of the same materials, and we have summarized the experimental results of perovskite composites with the morphologies of powders, thin films, nanocrystals, etc. in Table 3.20,21,23,24,36,47–49,65–83 For additional reading on similar application of non-oxide perovskites, such as organometallic halide perovskites, we point to some recently published articles.84–88

2.2 Ferroelectric solar cells based on the bulk photovoltaic effect
It was discovered in 1956 that an anomalous photovoltaic effect exists in BTO which is distinct from traditional photovoltaic effect in p–n junctions.89 Subsequently, this phenomenon was also observed in other perovskite oxides and was named as ferroelectric photovoltaic effect or bulk photovoltaic (BPV) effect.90–92 Before discussing the BPV effect in ferroelectric perovskites, it is necessary to look at how a traditional solar cell works. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the traditional solar cell is based on the principle of electron–hole separation by the built-in electric field of the p–n junction. When sunlight shines on the solar cell, photons with energy larger than the bandgap of the semiconductor material are absorbed. The absorbed photons activate electrons from the valence band to the conduction band, and the corresponding holes are left in the valence band. Then the photogenerated electrons and holes are separated by the built-in electric field and collected by suitable electrodes.93 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a solar cell is defined as the fraction of incident power which is converted to electricity and is expressed as (2)where Jsc is the short circuit current density, Voc is the open circuit voltage, FF is the fill factor and η is the efficiency. Theoretically, the maximum value of Voc is equal to the quasi-Fermi level separation of a p–n junction under illumination and is therefore limited by the bandgap of the absorbing semiconductors. Furthermore, the maximum PEC of traditional solar cells consisting of a single absorber is limited to the theoretical value of 31%, which is well known as the Shockley–Queisser limit.94
 Fig. 3  Schematic description of the (a) traditional photovoltaic effect in a p–n junction and (b) the bulk photovoltaic effect in a ferroelectric device. 
In contrast, the BPV effect originates from the spontaneous electric polarization in non-centrosymmetric materials as schematically illustrated in Fig. 3(b). In theory, the electrons in the non-centrosymmetric materials, such as ferroelectric perovskites, have different transition probability when jumping between states with momentum k and k′.95 According to the shift current model, when a uniform illumination is applied, the ferroelectrics could generate a steady-state current (jpv) which depends on the intensity and polarization of the light as described by jpv = αgI0(3)where α is the absorption coefficient, g is related to the light polarization vector and piezoelectric tensor, and I0 is the incident light intensity.96 If a voltage is applied parallel to the direction of the polarization, the total current (J) through the ferroelectric materials can be described as (4)where σd is the dark conductivity, σpv is the photoconductivity, V is the applied voltage, and d is the distance between electrodes.97 So, Voc of ferroelectric solar cells can be obtained by assuming the total current to be equal to zero: (5)From the above equations, we can find if the distance d is large enough or the photoconductivity σpv is small enough, the ferroelectric solar cells could have an ultra-high Voc exceeding the bandgap by several orders of magnitude. In this case, the ferroelectric solar cells could have a high PCE exceeding the Shockley–Queisser limit in principle.98 In the following, the recent experimental progress of ferroelectric perovskites for solar cell applications is reviewed.
As mentioned above, BTO is the first discovered material that exhibits a BPV effect. However, for a long time the PCE of BTO solar cells was extremely low due to the large bandgap (3.2 eV) that does not match the solar spectrum. Zenkevich et al. compared the BPV effect in BTO films and bulk crystals.96 They found that the photoinduced electric field in BTO increases with reduction of the film thickness. As a result, the measured PCE of BTO films with a thickness of few tens of nanometers is around 0.6%, which is 4.5 orders of magnitude larger as compared to that of the bulk BTO crystal they used.96 Spanier et al. measured the photoelectric properties of a BTO single crystal using an electrically conductive atomic force microscopy probe.99 They stated that the photoexcited non-thermalized carriers lose their energy and thus descend to the bottom of the band by moving over the mean free path l0 of around 100 nm for BTO. Thus, instead of the illumination area, the thermalization length l0 dictates the effective electrode area for current normalization and a hemispherical surface of radius l0 is used to estimate the Jsc value. The calculated PCE of a BTO device under 1 sun illumination is 4.8%, which clearly exceeds the Shockley–Queisser limit for a material with 3.2 eV bandgap.99 This phenomenon attracted significant attention in the solar cell community, but also caused some dispute.100 In the view of Kirk et al., the carrier collection area may be much larger than the contact area between the sample and the probe tip.100 This means that the Jsc and PCE values in ref. 99 are overestimated and the real PCE may be much lower than the reported value.
Another widely studied perovskite for photovoltaic devices is BFO which has a large saturation polarization (∼90 μC cm−2) and a smaller bandgap (∼2.7 eV) compared to other ferroelectric perovskites. In 2009, Choi et al. observed switchable diode and photovoltaic effects in single-ferroelectric-domain BFO crystals.101 In the same year, Yang et al. reported a ferroelectric-based device with a BFO absorber layer, a SrRuO3 bottom electrode and a tin doped indium oxide top electrode.102 When illuminated under a white light source with a power of 285 mW cm−2, the device exhibited an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 10% which was the maximum efficiency value under white light at that time.102 In 2011, Alexe et al. investigated the BPV effect in BFO single crystals using photoelectric atomic force microscopy and piezoresponse force microscopy.103 The photoelectric properties of their device were measured under 405 nm laser illumination. One interesting observation is that the obtained Voc can be as large as 30 V. This value is ten times larger than the bandgap of BFO.103 Seidel et al. studied the influence of ferroelectric domain walls on the generation of photovoltaic current as shown in Fig. 4.104 It was found that the BPV effect can be observed when the current flow is perpendicular to the aligned domain walls as schematically illustrated in Fig. 4(a). The measured Voc under white light illumination is around 16 V which is also much larger than the bandgap of BFO. Furthermore, the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of a device with individual domain walls is on the order of 10% for above-bandgap photons.104 Guo et al. found that the concentration and diffusion of oxygen vacancies have a large influence on the stability of the photovoltaic effect of BFO thin films.105 Xie et al. fabricated a flexible photovoltaic device based on (111)-oriented BFO films with naturally downward-oriented polarization as shown in Fig. 5.106 The photogenerated electron–hole pairs are separated by ferroelectric polarization which crosses the whole BFO layer under light illumination. The maximum Voc and Jsc are 0.52 V and 1.02 mA cm−2 when the laser with 405 nm wavelength illuminates the sample surface as shown in Fig. 5(b). Most importantly, there are small changes in Voc and Jsc for the BFO film before and after bending as exhibited in Fig. 5(c) and (d).106 The recent experimental results of pure perovskite oxides for photovoltaic devices are summarized in Table 4.96,99,101–109 These results are of vital importance to understand the BPV effect and to further develop ferroelectric solar cells. However, the large bandgap and serious leakage currents still limit the general properties of BFO devices.

Many efforts have been made to reduce the bandgap and the leakage currents of BFO by doping with suitable elements. For example, Ti-doped BFO thin films have been prepared via the sol–gel spin-coating method.110 The bandgap of doped BFO can be adjusted from 2.58 eV to 2.38 eV by controlling the doping concentration. The PCE of Ti-doped BFO thin films increases as the titanium content increases due to the combined action of increased remnant polarization and decreased band gap.110 Chang et al. doped BFO with various rare earth elements such as Dy, Gd, Eu, and Sm.111 The optical bandgap of this doped BFO is reduced to 2.21 eV which may be associated with oxygen vacancies and variable grain size. The maximal PCE under the illumination of a 405 nm diode laser is 0.35% for the Gd-doped BFO film.111 Mn-doped BFO films were fabricated by pulsed laser deposition (PLD), and the effects of Mn doping on the optical and photovoltaic characteristics of BFO films were systematically investigated by Yan et al.112 Their results demonstrate that both Voc and Jsc can be remarkably improved through doping with an appropriate amount of Mn.112 Gupta et al. compared the photovoltaic response of BFO films co-doped with Mn and Ce.113 Compared with single element doping, the Mn and Ce co-doped BFO films exhibit higher Voc and Jsc with no visible degradation during consecutive cycles of on/off illumination.113
Besides doped BFO, double perovskites and multilayers received a lot of attention due to the narrow bandgap. For instance, the Fe–Cr ordering in BFCO could cause hybridization of the d-bands of Fe and Cr with O 2p and thus change the interatomic distances and the bandgap.114 A high PCE of about 6% for red light was achieved due to the high degree of B-site cationic ordering between Fe and Cr sublattices.114 The bandgap of BFCO can be further tuned by engineering the cationic ordering as reported by Nechache et al.115 Under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2), the PCE values of the BFO single layer and multilayer are 3.3% and 8.1%, respectively.115 The multilayered structure of BFO and BTO thin films also possesses enhanced ferroelectric properties and photovoltaic response compared to single layers.116 This can be attributed to the strong depolarization field and lower band gap of the multilayered BFO/BTO structure.116 Bilayer thin films of BFO and BiMnO3 (BMO) were epitaxially grown on (111)-oriented Nb-doped STO substrates.117 Compared to individual single layers of BFO and BMO, the BFO/BMO bilayer exhibits a high PCE under AM 1.5G irradiation.117
More recently, Chakrabartty et al. reported a photovoltaic performance study of Bi–Mn–O composite thin films with mixed BMO and BiMn2O5 crystal phases.118 Due to the existence of the BiMn2O5 phase, a PCE of 4.2% under AM 1.5G irradiation was observed with a Voc of 1.48 eV which exceeded the bandgap of the individual phases.118 The recent experimental work on doped BFO and perovskite composites is summarized in Table 5.99–130 In addition, ideas based on strain engineering have been proposed for improving the properties of BFO-based photovoltaic devices.131–138 It has been proved by experiment that the bandgap of BFO can be adjusted by introducing strain in the films.131–134 The ferroelectric polarization also can be enhanced by strain, which is beneficial to photovoltaic performance.135–138 Besides, hexagonal rare earth manganites (RMnO3, R is a rare-earth ion) have also attracted considerable interest due to their intricate multiferroic properties and strong light absorption.139 Huang et al. demonstrated that these compounds can serve as very efficient photovoltaic materials, and a maximum light-to-electricity energy conversion efficiency of up to 30% was predicted.139 The evolution of PCE of ferroelectric solar cells in the last decade is displayed in Fig. 6.

 Fig. 6  Evolution of PCE of ABO3-type ferroelectric solar cells in the last decade. 
2.3 ABO3 film-based supercapacitors with high volumetric performance
Efficient and clean electrochemical energy storage technologies, such as batteries and supercapacitors, are of great importance for the utilization and distribution of renewable energy.140 Compared with battery-type electrode materials relying on strong Faraday reaction to store charge,141 capacitive electrode materials are based on the following three charge storage mechanisms: (1) surface-controlled electric double layer capacitance (EDLC), (2) surface-controlled redox pseudocapacitance, and (3) diffusion-controlled intercalation pseudocapacitance.142 Carbon-based materials usually depend on EDLC, which is based on surface-controlled ion adsorption to store charge, due to their high specific surface area. Some pseudocapacitive materials, such as conductive polymers, transition metal oxides and perovskite SrRuO3, undergo fast faradaic redox reactions at or near the surface to store charge, which are not limited by semi-infinite diffusion applied for traditional battery materials.128 Another type of pseudocapacitive material such as LaMnO3 (LMO) not only stores charge through surface-controlled redox pseudocapacitance, but also depends on the rapid diffusion of ions in and out of channels or layers inside host materials, which has been considered as diffusion-controlled intercalation pseudocapacitance.142 Based on the reversible redox reaction of metal ions, perovskite ABO3 films such as SrRuO3,143 BFO144 and LMO145 possess energy storage properties of high volumetric specific capacity and wide voltage window. However, there are disadvantages such as low rate capability and bad cycling stability due to the densely packed structure and multi-electron redox reaction kinetics, which inevitably prevent electrolyte ion diffusion and charge transfer. Electrochemical energy storage mechanisms and performance of perovskite ABO3 films can be significantly improved by optimizing their crystal structure and preparation methods, in order to obtain high-energy, high-power and long-lifetime electrochemical energy storage devices.
Perovskite SrRuO3 was reported by Wohlfahrt-Mehrens et al. to show pseudocapacitance behavior in 2002.143 Its charge storage mechanism is mainly dependent on the reversible redox reactions of Ru4+ ↔ Ru5+ and Ru4+ ↔ Ru3+ reflecting the characteristics of fast Faraday reaction, and is described as follows: SrRuO3 + OH− ↔ SrRuO3OH + e−(6) SrRuO3 + H2O + e− ↔ SrRuO2OH + OH−(7)A capacitance up to 270 F g−1 is obtained by optimizing the composition and preparation route. Furthermore, foreign metal doping such as La and Mn also leads to a remarkable increase of specific capacitance, attributed to introduced defects and the enlarged free lattice volume, which facilitates the mobility of electrolyte ions in the host lattice. However, the energy storage mechanisms of doped SrRuO3 are not fully understood and require further study. Additionally, SrRuO3 with its high metallic conductivity (<10−3 Ω cm) can be usually chosen as a conductive buffer for the epitaxial growth of perovskite ABO3 materials, due to its small lattice mismatch with common substrates, such as the widely used STO single crystals.146
As another typical perovskite ABO3 material, BFO has shown promising applications in energy conversion and storage.147 Among the previously reported BFO-based electrodes and devices listed in Table 6, three-dimensional (3D) nanoarchitectures of BFO anchored TiO2 nanotube arrays provide the highest specific capacitance (440 F g−1 at 1.1 A g−1), high energy and power densities (46.5 W h kg−1, 1.2 kW kg−1), reflecting that structural optimization of electrodes plays an important role in improving the supercapacitive performances of BFO-based electrodes.148 However, another BFO-based asymmetric supercapacitor was previously reported to provide relatively low specific capacitance (<163 F g−1), narrow operating voltage window (<1.3 V) and bad cyclic stability (<3000 cycles), probably attributed to irreversible phase transformations of BFO during the charge/discharge process.144 In alkaline electrolyte, perovskite BFO is indicative of irreversible phase decomposition during the charge/discharge process, due to Bi3+ ion extraction from the A site in the initial 500 cycles, resulting in Bi2O3 and residual Bi-deficient BFO (as shown in Fig. 7). These irreversible products undergo additional separate electrochemical processes in the subsequent cycles. The extracted Bi3+ ions can play a dominant role in the electrochemical process via redox reactions of Bi3+ ↔ Bi2+ ↔ Bi0. Although heteroatomic doping at the A site (such as yttrium) can suppress this irreversible phase decomposition to a certain extent, it remains a huge challenge to develop an effective approach to improve the structural instability of BFO under consecutive charge/discharge cycles in alkaline electrolytes.

Recently, the cation/anion intercalation pseudocapacitance mechanism has been proposed and widely promoted,145,152 in order to improve the charge storage kinetics of energy storage materials, especially of perovskites. LMO as a perovskite-type oxide has shown unique structural stability of the cation sublattice accompanied by mobile oxygen ions under electrical polarization, thus accounting for the anion intercalation pseudocapacitance mechanism.145 In the first step, oxygen vacancies are filled through intercalation of electrolyte oxygen ions and diffusion of O2− along octahedral edges through the crystal. This is accompanied by the oxidation of two Mn2+ centers to Mn3+. In the next step, excess oxygen is intercalated at the surface through diffusion of manganese to the surface and oxidation of two Mn3+ centers to Mn4+. Based on the anion intercalation pseudocapacitance mechanism, the existence of oxygen vacancies in the crystal lattice can significantly improve the specific capacitance and rate capability of LMO. In view of this, doping of perovskite ABO3 films to introduce oxygen vacancies into the crystal lattice has been confirmed to be a high-efficiency route to improve ion diffusion kinetics and charge storage dynamics.
The rational optimization of preparation methods is essential for boosting the supercapacitive performances of perovskite ABO3 films. Many techniques can be used to prepare perovskite ABO3 films, such as solution methods,149,151,153 magnetron sputtering147 and laser molecular beam epitaxy (LMBE).147 Solution methods such as hydrothermal reaction,149 electrochemical deposition,151 and sol–gel process153 are prone to produce impurities, which not only seriously disturb the crystal structure of perovskite thin films, but also probably decrease specific capacitance through relatively weak Faraday reaction to store charge.151 Magnetron sputtering seems to be difficult to overcome multiple grain boundary defects and complex lattice orientation, due to the lack of regulating lattice orientations, which directly affect the crystal structure and vacancy defects of perovskite thin films. Differently from the above methods, LMBE, i.e. PLD with in situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) control of the growing film, allows atomic-level precise preparation of high-quality perovskite epitaxial thin films on single crystalline substrates.147 PLD with in situ RHEED using lattice-matched substrates enables the study of the relationship of vacancy defects and charge storage dynamics to improve the supercapacitive performances of perovskite ABO3 films.
3 Interface-induced quantum states in ABO3 superlattices
“The interface is the device”, Herbert Kroemer stated in his Nobel price address. This famous phrase was referred to the great success of devices based on thin semiconductor films for photonic and electronic application. A similar revolution is in progress for the transition metal oxides with the technical advances in the atomic-scale synthesis of oxide heterostructures. Especially for the artificial perovskite SLs, the unique atomic configuration and electronic orders lead to emergent phenomena and novel device applications.11,154 In this section, we will review the studies on 2DEGs, interface superconductivity, and topological quantum states in ABO3 SLs. The SLs mentioned in this section are formed by epitaxial perovskite oxide films. Typical structures of SLs are schematically presented in Fig. 8(a) and 10(a).

3.1 Two-dimensional electron gas and interface superconductivity
2DEGs have been observed at the interface of conventional semiconductor heterostructures, such as AlGaAs/GaAs, AlGaN/GaN, InGaN/InN and MgZnO/ZnO.155–158 With typical sheet carrier densities ranging from 1010 cm−2 to 1012 cm−2, a 2DEG at semiconductor interfaces is greatly useful in fabricating high electron-mobility transistors and designing new optoelectronic devices. More interestingly, it was found by Ohtomo and Hwang in 2004 that a high-mobility electron gas can be created at the interface between two perovskite insulators, LaAlO3 (LAO) and STO with a sizable bandgap of 3.2 eV and 5.6 e V.159 The electron density of the 2DEG in LAO/STO is as high as 1014 cm−2 which is about two orders than that of the semiconductor heterointerface.159 Since then, the high-mobility 2DEG LAO/STO system has served as a favorite playground to understand the physics behind this fascinating phenomenon, and to create novel quantum states at such interfaces.
However, up to now, the origin of the 2DEG in LAO/STO is still under debate. In the view of Ohtomo and Hwang, the 2DEG is related to the existence of a polar discontinuity across the LAO/STO interface.159 Along the (001) direction, the perovskite structure ABO3 can be considered as alternating stacks of AO and BO2. Both SrO and TiO2 layers are charge neutral in the STO substrate. In contrast, LaO and AlO2 layers carry positive and negative charge in the LAO thin film, respectively. Therefore, the resulting polar discontinuity leads to an electric field inside the LAO layer and a potential that grows as the LAO layer thickness increases.160 This is the so-called “polar catastrophe” that leads to the electrons confined to the interface with an ultra-high mobility, i.e. to the 2DEG. The polar discontinuity theory is well accepted to describe the behavior of electrons in the (001)-oriented LAO/STO SLs.161 However, this theory ignores the role of oxygen vacancies and cannot explain the observation of a metallic state in the (110)-oriented LAO/STO interface.162–164 On the other hand, the metallic interfaces can be realized in STO-based heterostructures with various insulating overlayers, such as amorphous LAO, STO and yttria-stabilized zirconia films.165 Hence, different from the polar discontinuity theory, Chen et al. suggested another mechanism to explain the origin of the 2DEG in LAO/STO samples grown by PLD.165 Taking the chemical reactivity of the plasma into account, the deposited species react with the oxygen ions in the STO substrate. Therefore, the resulting interfacial conductivity may be related to the oxygen vacancies which are generated during deposition.165 Sambri et al. further studied how the gas atmosphere during deposition influences the conductivity of LAO/STO interfaces.166 The amorphous LAO was deposited on STO at room temperature by PLD. The LAO ablation plume dynamics and composition were investigated both in Ar and O2 background gas by fast photography and space-resolved optical emission spectroscopy. The results show a striking correlation between deposition condition and interface conductivity of LAO/STO, and support the mechanism suggested by Chen et al. in ref. 165.166 Other mechanisms have also been discussed, such as the electronic reconstruction mechanism and the orbital reconstruction mechanism.167,168 Three possible mechanisms for the origin of a 2DEG in LAO/STO heterostructures are schematically presented in Fig. 8.169 All these mechanisms have contributed to the understanding of the 2DEG and promoted the study of interface superconductivity in perovskites.
It was discovered by Reyren et al. in 2007 that superconductivity emerged in the electron gas at the LAO/STO interface when the sample temperature is below 200 mK.170 As shown in Fig. 9(a), the samples with 8- and 15-unit cells (uc) undergo a transition into a state for which no resistance could be measured. When a magnetic field of 180 mT is applied perpendicular to the interface, the zero-resistance state is completely suppressed as shown in Fig. 9(b). The superconducting coherence lengths of 8-uc and 15-uc samples are around 70 nm and 105 nm, respectively, which can be estimated by the upper critical field values shown in Fig. 9(c). All these results provided clear evidence for superconductivity of the 2DEG.170 In the following year, Cariglio et al. found that the 2D superconducting state and the insulating state in the LAO/STO interface can be tuned by an electric field.171 Yada et al. studied the electron gas and superconducting states theoretically by using the Hubbard model with Rashba-type spin–orbit interaction and found that the superconductivity can be controlled by the applied voltage.172 In conventional superconductors, it has been known for a long time that ferromagnetism is incompatible with superconductivity as it destroys the singlet correlations responsible for the pairing interaction. However, clear evidence for coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism was found in the LAO/STO interface.173 Stornaiuolo et al. found an unconventional superconductivity in the LAO/STO interface using Josephson junctions as spectroscopic probes.174 The transport properties reveal the presence of two superconducting gap structures which are possibly related to the interplay between superconductivity and the large spin–orbit coupling in the 2DEG.174

Interface superconductivity was observed not only in LAO/STO, but also in LaTiO3/STO which displays properties very similar to those of LAO/STO.175,176 Besides, high temperature superconducting behavior was theoretically predicted in LaNiO3 (LNO) SLs.177,178 Most of the known cuprate superconductors share a single feature – they are all based on a layered structure made up of one or more copper-oxygen planes. Although the theory of high-temperature superconductivity is incomplete on empirical grounds, the key electronic and structural features are well known as spin one-half, a quasi 2D layered structure, no orbital degeneracy, and strong antiferromagnetic correlation.177 LNO is a strongly correlated metallic oxide with spin one-half 3d electrons in Ni3+ ions. Bulk LNO has degenerate eg bands, but sandwiching a LNO layer between insulating layers, as shown in Fig. 10, will form a quasi 2D structure and relieve the degeneracy.178 In addition, the strong antiferromagnetic correlations were revealed in (001)-oriented LNO/LAO SLs with the magnitude of the antiferromagnetic coupling constant higher than that in cuprates.178 Thus, the nondegenerate spin one-half electronic structure – as in cuprates – was theoretically predicted in LNO-based SLs. Many experimental work has been done to obtain epitaxial LNO/LAO SLs and study the related electronic states. Liu et al. investigated the effect of polar discontinuity on the growth of LNO/LAO SLs.179 Detemple et al. studied the formation of Ruddlesden–Popper faults in this kind of SLs.180 Wei et al. revealed the dimensionality-controlled metal–insulator transition (MIT) in LNO/LAO.181 However, almost all experimental work revealed that the LNO/LAO SLs undergo a metal to insulator transition with the decrease of thickness or temperature.181–183 More efforts are still encouraged to further study the interface phenomena of perovskite SLs.

3.2 Topological insulators and anomalous quantum Hall effect
Topological insulators (TIs) are materials with a bulk insulating gap, exhibiting quantum-Hall-like behavior in the absence of a magnetic field.184 The quantum Hall effect is a quantum-mechanical version of the Hall effect in which the resistance is quantized as h/e2, i.e. contains only fundamental constants, that is, Planck's constant h and the electron charge e.185 The observation of the quantum Hall effect usually requires very low temperatures and strong magnetic fields.186 In 1988, Haldane proposed that electrons hopping on a honeycomb lattice could realize the quantum Hall effect in the absence of Landau levels.187 Along this direction, a key theoretical advance was made by Kane et al. in 2005. They predicted that the ground state of a single plane of graphene exhibits a quantum spin Hall effect and has a nontrivial topological order that is robust against small perturbations.188,189 Subsequently, Zhang et al. made a theoretical prediction that a 2D TI with quantized charge conductance along the edges could be realized in (Hg, Cd)Te quantum wells.190 In 2007, the quantized charge conductance was indeed observed in this system, as quantum-Hall-like plateaus in zero magnetic field.191
The next important theoretical development, in 2006, was the discovery that the topological characterization of the quantum spin Hall state has a natural generalization in three dimensions and the coinage of the term “topological insulator” to describe this electronic phase.192–195 In 2008, Hsieh et al. reported the experimental discovery of the first three-dimensional TI in Bi1−xSbx.196 In 2009, second-generation TIs, including Bi2Se3, were identified experimentally with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy.197 Until 2010, the material prediction and realization of TIs was limited to narrow band-gap semiconductors based on Hg or Bi compounds. Xiao et al. first demonstrated the design principle for realizing 2D TIs in bilayers of perovskite-type TMOs grown along the [111] crystallographic axis.198 The key idea is to start with a band structure that possessed “Dirac points” in the Brillouin zone without spin–orbit coupling, and then to examine whether an energy gap can be opened at those points with spin-orbital coupling turned on. An opening of the energy gap at these Dirac points combined with proper filling of the resulting states may result in a topologically conducting behavior.198
The honeycomb lattice is well known to support semimetallic band structures, for instance, in graphene.187,189 A similar band structure can also be obtained in the perovskite SLs with elaborated design. Considering bilayers of the ABO3 perovskite structure grown in the [111] direction, i.e. two LNO monolayers are sandwiched between band insulator layers of LAO, the B ions in the bilayer are located on a buckled honeycomb lattice as shown in Fig. 11.199 DFT studies have shown that eg electrons hopping on this honeycomb lattice give rise to a Dirac point in the Brillouin zone.200,201 Allowing full lattice relaxation breaks the inversion symmetry Z2 and results in two inequivalent Ni sites which destroy the Dirac point by opening a gap at K and K′.202 The calculated band gap of bilayer LNO/LAO SLs is about 60 meV and depends on the Coulomb interaction.202 A set of broken-symmetry 2D ground states were predicted to exhibit properties of ferromagnetic Mott insulators, switchable multiferroics, half-semimetallic 2DEGs, and possibly topological phases.202

In experimental section, Middey et al. obtained (111)-oriented LNO/LAO SLs which were epitaxially grown on a LAO substrate.203 The analysis of the electrical transport performance revealed a single bandgap of about 95 meV which is in good agreement with the theoretical value of 60 meV given by ref. 202.203 Wei et al. further studied the influence of polarity on the conductivity of epitaxial LNO/LAO(111) SLs.204 It was found that the electrical transport is dominated by 2D variable range hopping for SLs grown on a polar mismatched STO(111) substrate, and it switches to a thermally activated single-gap behavior on polar matched LAO(111).204 However, no experimental evidence of a topological phase has been obtained up to now. A possible reason is related to the LNO material which supports a weak Hubbard repulsion and results in a magnetic insulating phase.205 Therefore, another well-known perovskite, LMO, became a hot research topic which was considered as a candidate for a Chern insulator.205
A Chern insulator is a species of TI with broken time reversal symmetry. It is defined as an insulator whose occupied bands carry a nonzero Chern number (C ≠ 0).206 A Chern insulator exhibits the anomalous quantum Hall effect with a quantized, dissipationless transport in chiral edge channels, in the absence of an external magnetic field and magnetic field-induced Landau levels.207 The first successful experimental observation of the anomalous quantum Hall effect was realized in Cr-doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 around 30 mK in 2013.208 Meanwhile, issues related to bulk conductivity and Cr doping inhomogeneities remain to be clarified.209,210 For potential device applications, it is important to find stoichiometric materials for the anomalous quantum Hall effect, and increase the working temperature by increasing the topologically nontrivial band gap as well as the Curie temperature of magnetic moments.211
The keys to realize Chern insulators are broken time reversal symmetry and spin–orbit coupling.212 TMO heterostructures provide such a platform due to the strong spin–orbit coupling and electronic correlations. A (111)-oriented bilayer of perovskite LMO forms a buckled honeycomb lattice which can support the Dirac-cone-type band structure. A theory based on first-principles calculations and the tight-binding model revealed the Fermi energy of a LMO/LaScO3(111) SL just fixed at the Dirac point.205 Taking the spin–orbit coupling into account, band gaps appear at both K and Γ points as shown in Fig. 12, rendering a topologically insulating phase (Chern insulator).205 Doennig et al. designed (111)-oriented LMO/LAO SLs in which a Dirac semimetal, a Chern and a trivial Mott insulator can be tuned with interaction strength and lattice distortions.213 In 2017, the first experimental work was done by Wei et al., who reported the epitaxial growth and structural properties of LMO/LAO SLs with (001), (011), and (111) out-of-plane orientation.214 A paramagnetic–ferromagnetic phase transition was found with decreasing temperature around 100 K, indicating a controllable ferroic order at low temperatures.214 The ideal LMO/LAO(111) SL is expected to exhibit Dirac-cone-like features, which however have not been observed so far. A possible reason is the existence of large Jahn–Teller interaction which may suppress the topological phase and lead to a trivial insulating state in the SLs.214 Hence, the influence of Jahn–Teller interaction on the electrical transport of perovskite SLs has to be clarified and more experimental work is required for the further study of highly correlated electronic states in perovskites.

4 Principle and processes of two-dimensional growth of ABO3 thin film superlattices
Realization of high-performance applications requires advanced growth techniques. For example, PLD is one of the most versatile growth methods for high-quality epitaxial multifunctional thin films and short-period SLs.215 This section attempts to provide a brief description of epitaxial growth modes, in particular 2D layer-by-layer growth and real-time monitoring using RHEED.
Epitaxial growth refers to the formation of a single crystalline film on top of a single crystal substrate and subsequent evolution of a specific crystallographic orientation relationship between the film and the substrate as growth commences.216 The specific orientational relationship is governed by the crystal systems and lattice parameters of the two materials. The growth of epitaxial thin films on a single crystalline surface depends critically on the interaction strength between adatoms and the surface. There are three primary growth modes: Volmer–Weber mode (3D nucleation growth), Frank–van der Merwe mode (2D layer-by-layer growth), and Stranski–Krastanov mode (mixed 2D–3D growth mode). In Volmer–Weber growth, the interaction between adatoms is stronger than their bonding to the substrate, leading to the formation of 3D adatom clusters or islands. In contrast, in Frank–van der Merwe growth, the bonding between adatoms is weak. This results in the smallest extent of nuclei on the substrate surface in two dimensions and the formation of a complete monolayer before significant clusters are developed in the next monolayer.217 The Stranski–Krastanov growth mode lies between the two above mentioned growth modes, i.e. the growth changes from a 2D-monolayer to a 3D-island after the formation of a few monolayers.217 This is believed to happen at a critical layer thickness and to be related to the stress impact after 2D growth.218 Another important growth mode, named step flow growth, is found when the film is deposited on a miscut substrate at elevated temperature. In this mode, atoms are absorbed on the surface and move to a step edge before nucleation of an island.
Experimentally, for the realization and real-time monitoring of the 2D growth, it is important to prepare atomically smooth substrates with terraced surfaces. The crystal structure of ABO3 perovskites consists of alternating AO and BO2 (or AO3 and B) planes along the [001] (or [111]) direction. Both terminations can coexist and balance, depending on their relative surface energy.219,220 In order to obtain an atomically flat single-terminated surface, three process steps are required. At first, the miscut of the substrate has to be determined by performing X-ray diffractometry-based ω-scans with four φ angles separated by 90°.221 Then, based on the value of the miscut, an etching process has to be performed for each substrate to obtain a single-terminated surface. Finally, the substrates are annealed in an oxygen atmosphere at a suitable temperature to allow recrystallization of their surfaces.215
During film growth, the surface morphology can be analyzed by RHEED. Typical RHEED patterns from different kinds of surfaces are shown schematically in Fig. 13(a)–(d). Fig. 13(a) presents a RHEED diffraction pattern with sharp circular spots from a nearly ideal atomically smooth surface. The elliptic points in Fig. 13(b) indicate a smooth surface with a high density of atomic steps which depends on the miscut of the substrate. Fig. 13(c) is the transmission diffraction pattern through 3D clusters on the surface. Instead of sharp spots, the concentric circular pattern in Fig. 13(d) is obtained by diffraction from a polycrystalline or textured surface.
 Fig. 13  (a–d) Schematic RHEED patterns for different kinds of crystalline surfaces. (e) Sketch of the evolution of RHEED oscillations during 2D epitaxial growth. Θ is the fractional layer coverage. See the text for more detailed explanations. 

Fig. 13(e) shows the formation of a single complete layer and the evolution of RHEED oscillations of the intensity of a specular beam during 2D epitaxial growth. Θ is the fractional layer coverage. There is a maximum intensity for the initial smooth surfaces with θ = 0. The intensity decreases and reaches a minimum when the growing monolayer is approximately half complete. Afterwards the intensity increases until it reaches the next maximum, which indicates the completion of one monolayer. It is worth mentioning that, in the real growth process, nucleation on top of 2D islands starts before the completion of a monolayer and leads to a roughening of the surface. This results in an increasing damping of the RHEED intensity oscillations. Accordingly, in the deposition of different kinds of materials, i.e., heterostructure SLs, the mobility of adatoms at a given pressure and temperature is a limitation which causes a multilevel 2D growth mode. To improve the single-level 2D growth, the pulsed laser interval deposition was developed.222 It is based on a periodic sequence: fast deposition of the amount of material needed to complete one monolayer followed by an interval in which no deposition takes place and the film can reorganize.222–224 This interval PLD process allows the growth of heterostructures in a layer-by-layer mode in a wider growth parameter range. Specific examples and growth details of perovskite SLs are described in ref. 215 and 225.
5 Conclusion and outlook
Here, we have reviewed the current research status of perovskite oxides in two innovative fields, first for fabricating energy harvesters, and second for designing new quantum states. Although a lot of significant achievements have been made, several issues and challenges still need to be further explored.
Major progress in the development of ABO3-based photocatalysts for water splitting has been achieved. Especially in perovskite composites, high photocatalytic activity for H2 was realized due to their high stability and suitable band-edge positions. The consideration of ferroelectricity and strain engineering is a possibility to enhance the generation and separation of photoinduced charges.
The bulk photovoltaic effect gained more and more attention in materials and energy science. Large bandgaps and low light absorption efficiencies limit the photoelectric properties of perovskites. Doping or fabricating multilayered structures is an effective method to increase the efficiency of traditional solar cells, which can also be introduced in ferroelectric solar cells to achieve a more complete absorption of the solar spectrum.
Development of growth techniques is a major prerequisite for realization of the various device applications. In particular, PLD is one of the most successful techniques for complex high-quality oxide heterostructures.226,227 Epitaxial coherence of the coupled phases is a major prerequisite for many of the discussed effects.228
Two-dimensional electron gases, interface superconductivity, and topologically insulating states are theoretically predicted in ABO3-type heterostructures and superlattices. But not so many experimental efforts are known to prove these challenging predictions, partly due to the challenges in the growth of high-quality samples, and because of the difficulties in detecting the predicted behavior. With that, the inherent Jahn–Teller interaction in perovskites was considered to be a big problem which may suppress the theoretically found topological phases. Therefore, more experiments are encouraged to clarify the relationship between Jahn–Teller interaction and the electrical transport in perovskite superlattices. We believe that more breakthroughs in these fields can be achieved and new device applications will enter real life in near future.
For additional reading on the oxide electronic aspects of various perovskites, but also other oxides, we point to two recently published roadmap articles, i.e. “The 2016 oxide electronic materials and oxide interfaces roadmap” and “Towards Oxide Electronics: a Roadmap”.229,230
