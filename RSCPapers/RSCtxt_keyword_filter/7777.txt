Retrograde solubility enables to develop inverse temperature crystallization of FAPbX3 (FA = HC(NH2)2+, X = Br−/I−). FAPbI3 crystals exhibit a 1.4 eV bandgap – considerably narrower than their polycrystalline counterparts.
Pioneering studies on utilizing hybrid perovskites in photovoltaics1–3 drew the attention of many researchers to this promising class of semiconductors, which possess strong and tunable absorptions and emissions,4 as well as remarkable charge-carrier diffusion lengths.5 Combined with the facile and low-cost deposition methods,6–9 these properties thrust perovskites to the forefront of modern optoelectronic semiconductor devices such as solar cells,10–17 photodetectors,18–20 light emitting diodes,21 lasers,22 X-ray detectors23 and ambipolar phototransistors.24 The optical properties of hybrid perovskites, such as MAPbX3 and FAPbX3 (where MA = CH3NH3+, and FA = HC(NH2)2+ and X = Cl−, Br−, I−), show an astonishing sensitivity to their compositions. For instance, in the widely investigated MAPbX3, the substitution of Cl− with Br− or I− narrows the bandgap from 3.11 to 2.35 or 1.6 eV, respectively.25,26 Although MAPbI3 is thoroughly exploited as an active/absorber layer in solar cells, its bandgap is still significantly larger than the optimum for a single-junction solar cell (∼1.34 eV).27
Further narrowing of the perovskite bandgap was demonstrated through the replacement of the small MA (1.8 Å) cation with a larger FA (1.9–2.2 Å) cation, forming FAPbX3; in polycrystalline thin films, the bandgap was reduced from 1.6 eV to 1.48 eV,28–30 indicating a potentially higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of FAPbI3-based solar cells. For this reason, FAPbI3 is actively replacing MAPbX3 in the most efficient perovskite solar cells,28–35 with PCE values reaching 20%.28
The overwhelming majority of perovskite devices are based upon polycrystalline thin films – a material that suffers immensely from a high density of traps and grain boundaries, which markedly limit the potential performance in devices. Recently, it was reported that hybrid perovskite single crystals display exceptionally low trap densities (∼6 orders of magnitude less compared to their polycrystalline films).5,36 Therefore, higher crystallinity is an extremely desired criterion for further improvement of perovskite-based device performances. However, the synthesis of perovskite crystals through the classical cooling37 or antisolvent vapor-assisted crystallization5 techniques is a time-consuming process that requires weeks to prepare high-quality crystals. Recently, we reported a rapid inverse temperature crystallization (ITC) method for the synthesis of MAPbX3.36 This method takes advantage of the retrograde solubility regime – a peculiar regime in which the loss of solubility occurs in a specific solvent or solvents at elevated temperatures.36,38,39 However, the retrograde solubility of the highly desired FA-based perovskites has thus far not been reported. Retrograde solubility enables a facile and rapid route to grow crystals, and if established in FAPbX3, this could allow for a more extensive use of this emerging subclass of hybrid perovskites, not only with regard to fundamental aspects but also in the practical design of optoelectronic devices.
Normally that salts possess higher solubilities at elevated temperatures. Remarkably, we observed the formation of perovskite precipitates in specific solvents at elevated temperatures, which is an indication of retrograde solubility. Nevertheless, this abnormal retrograde solubility behavior was noted for few salts.40 To confidently validate the retrograde solubility behavior of the hybrid perovskites, we tested their solubilities in various solvents at different temperatures and determined that γ-butyrolactone (GBL) is generally a suitable solvent for I-based perovskites, whereas the more polar N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) is the suitable solvent for the Br-based ones to induce the retrograde solubility. The effect of temperature on the solubility of methylammonium and formamidinium lead halides is shown in Fig. 1. The negative slopes of the curves clearly confirmed the retrograde solubility behavior of the perovskites in the mentioned solvents.

Importantly, individual precursors (PbX2 or MAX) in the corresponding solvents did not show retrograde solubility behavior. These two observations – retrograde solubility being tied to the whole perovskite and retrograde solubility dependence on solvent – indicate that the energetics of precursor–solvent complexes is likely to be responsible for this phenomenon. These complexes disassociate at elevated temperature, commencing crystallization.

Fig. 1A shows the temperature-dependent solubility of the most widely used hybrid perovskite – MAPbI3 in GBL. Interestingly, the solubility of MAPbI3 in GBL increased with a corresponding increase in the temperature from 20 °C to 60 °C; however, further heating resulted in the loss of solubility. The presence of both positive and negative slopes on the solubility curve indicates that there are two competing processes occurring in the solution during heating – the formation of complexes and their dissociation. At T < 60 °C, the formation of complexes prevails, while at T > 60 °C, the dissociation of complexes dominates over their formation. Remarkably, the solubility of MAPbI3 decreased by more than a factor of two upon heating from 60 °C to 130 °C. Recently, retrograde solubility enabled us to design a facile and rapid route to grow high-quality bulk MAPbI3 single crystals,36 and establishing this phenomenon in FAPbI3 will allow more extensive use of this emerging subclass of perovskite crystals.
Through the choice of suitable solvent, we found that a single GBL solvent can also be used to commence the retrograde solubility of FAPbI3 (Fig. 1B); its solubility drops by more than three times upon heating from 20 °C to 130 °C. Furthermore, we optimized the conditions to grow FAPbI3 by ITC. Using 1 M solution of FAPbI3 in GBL at 100 °C frequently resulted in the formation of needle-like yellow crystals, which gradually transforms into black crystals with mosaic morphology and many cracks. Due to the stability of the black phase at elevated temperatures,30–32 we reasoned that higher temperature of crystallization could result in the direct formation of black crystals. Therefore, we used 0.8 M solution to increase the onset of crystallization temperature to 115 °C, and successfully grew crack- and grain boundary-free (Fig. S1, ESI†) black crystals in 3 h (Fig. 2A) (see ESI,† for details). Powder XRD of freshly prepared crystals perfectly matches with previously reported cubic phase α-FAPbI3 (Fig. 2B).41 As reported,30–32 due to the instability of the black polymorph, it transformed into the yellow phase δ-FAPbI3 (Fig. S2, ESI†) in air in 24 h and a humidity of 55–57%.

We didn't observe the retrograde solubility behavior of I-based perovskites in more polar solvent – DMF or DMSO. We speculate that the lead iodide complexes with DMF or DMSO42 seem to be stronger compared to the GBL, which do not decompose in solution at elevated temperatures without evaporation of solvents.
In contrast, retrograde solubility behavior of Br-based perovskites was observed only in DMF-based solvents (Fig. 1C and D). Fig. 1C shows that the solubility of MAPbBr3 in DMF decreased significantly – almost by a factor of three, when it was heated from 20 °C to 100 °C. Previously, we used a single solvent (DMF) for the ITC of MAPbBr3.36 DMF can also be used as a sole solvent for FAPbBr3 synthesis by ITC; however, although it forms a highly saturated solution in DMF at room temperature (∼3.12 M), only small crystals were produced at 120 °C. The solubility of FAPbBr3 in DMF decreased only 1.7 times upon heating from 20 °C to 100 °C (Fig. S3, ESI†). Therefore, to increase the yield of crystallization and to avoid over-consumption of the precursors, we reasoned that the dilution of the DMF polarity through mixing with the less polar GBL could increase the negative slope of the solubility curve. We found that the retrograde solubility behavior of FAPbBr3 can be initiated in a 1:1 v/v of DMF:GBL, while the solubility decreased by more than three times through an increase in the temperature from 20 °C to 100 °C. For ITC of FAPbBr3, we used 1 M solution in 1:1 v/v DMF:GBL with the crystallization onset at 55 °C to grow crack-free crystals (see ESI† for details). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the FAPbBr3 ground crystals matched with the reported cubic phase of FAPbBr3 (Fig. 2C and D).43
The yield of the crystallization – the ratio of the mass of the crystals to the precursors – can be estimated from the solubility curves (Fig. 1). These curves also demonstrated that there are several ways to increase the yield: (1) the initial use of higher precursor concentrations (Fig. S4, ESI,† validates this concept); and (2) the utilization of a higher crystallization temperature (Fig. S5, ESI†). In classical cooling and antisolvent vapor-assisted crystallization techniques, non-equimolar precursors (for instance, the ratio of MAI:PbI2 is 3:1 for the antisolvent technique)5 or the presence of foreign additives (for example, hydro-iodide acid in the classical cooling technique)37 renders the leftover solution unusable. In contrast, the overconsumption of solvents and precursors is minimized in the ITC method because the depleted solution can be repeatedly used for crystallization by dissolving more precursors, due to the utilization of equimolar amounts of the precursors and the reduced requirement of the solvents.
Given the emergence of FAPbX3 as the perovskite of choice in solar cells, it is important to elucidate the optical bandgaps of its crystals, which have thus far not been reported. Having the macroscopic crystals, we studied the absorption of the FAPbX3 crystals (Fig. 3). Very intriguingly, we observed that α-FAPbI3 crystals absorb light efficiently up to 900 nm, which is 80 nm broader than their polycrystalline counterpart (Fig. S6, ESI†). A Tauc plot shows that the bandgap of α-FAPbI3 is 1.4 eV; this value is 70 meV narrower than previous reports for this material.30,44 Analogously, the absorption edge of FAPbBr3 was found to be located at 580 nm, corresponding to a bandgap of 2.13 eV, 130 meV narrower than that of the FAPbBr3 polycrystalline thin film (Fig. S6, ESI†).43 Narrowing of bandgap in MAPbX3 single crystals compared to its polycrystalline films was also observed before, which was attributed to lower trap densities due to higher-dimensional structurally coherent units that are more tight in the single crystal compared to their polycrystalline counterparts.5,19,36 Hence, single crystals provide the ideal platform to extract the real bandgap. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a 1.4 eV bandgap in α-FAPbI3. Our findings indicate that devices based upon α-FAPbI3 crystals may deliver higher efficiencies than their polycrystalline thin films owing to their broader absorption of the solar spectrum.

In summary, we demonstrated the temperature-dependent solubility of hybrid organolead halide perovskites. We showed that the retrograde behavior and ITC are not limited to MAPbX3 perovskites but could be generalized, by solvent selection, to FAPbX3. Grown crystals of FAPbI3 exhibited a 1.4 eV bandgap, which was significantly lower than that of their polycrystalline counterpart. These findings provide an additional impetus to improve the crystallinity of FAPbI3 for further enhancements in solar cell efficiencies.
