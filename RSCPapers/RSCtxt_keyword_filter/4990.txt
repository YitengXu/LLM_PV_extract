    , Accepted 9th April 2023First published on 10th April 2023AbstractCadmium sulfide has long been used as the buffer layer in thin-film solar cells. Despite its strengths, the problems associated with CdS – a low bandgap, absorption loss, and toxicity of Cd – have resulted in a search for alternate materials. Incorporating Zn results in a higher bandgap but obtaining complete coverage with a flake-free, compact morphology of Cd1−xZnxS films using chemical bath deposition remains an unsolved problem. In this paper, we address the coverage issue and engineer the morphology of Cd1−xZnxS films (x = 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8), focusing on controlling the formation mechanism by dynamically maintaining the pH of the precursor solution throughout the deposition. Heterogeneously grown Cd1−xZnxS films show high uniformity and improved structural properties. With a successive increment of the Zn amount, the Cd1−xZnxS optical bandgap enhances considerably from 2.55 eV to 3.77 eV. By depositing at the right pH, we report – for both low and high Zn – films that are compact and pin-hole free with 100% coverage which is rarely found in the literature. The significant improvement in average visible transmittance (AVT) from 51% (pristine CdS) to 75% (for Cd0.8Zn0.2S) and then to 85% (for Cd0.2Zn0.8S) indicates the potential to improve the efficiency of thin-film solar cells including for some novel applications such as semi-transparent photovoltaics.
1 Introduction
Human-driven climate change – originating mostly from the burning of fossil fuels – has triggered worldwide research in the past few decades on clean and renewable energy technologies such as solar photovoltaics (PVs). A massive deployment of solar panels will be required in the coming decades to increase the share of renewable, clean energy in power grids. Among the PV technologies, thin-film PVs comprise only a few micrometer thick layers of semiconductor (SC) materials, making them advantageous over other generations of PVs.1,2 The performance of solar cells does not only depend on the improved quality of the absorbers but also on the formation of good heterojunctions. For high-performing PVs, the separation of charge carriers by the built-in electric field in the space-charge region is as important as the photogeneration of carriers. Proper band alignment, favorable lattice mismatch between the absorber and buffer layer and reduced defect density at the interface can greatly minimize recombination and facilitate charge separation. CdS – a II–VI group, n-type material – is well-established for forming p–n junctions in CIGS, CZTS, CdTe solar cells.3–7 However, it has some drawbacks that restrict the performance of thin-film PVs. CdS has been reported to limit the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of CZTS and CdTe cells owing to interface recombination arising from undesirable band alignment.8,9 It forms a cliff-like conduction band offset (CBO) with the absorber. Cliff-like CBO impedes electron flow from the buffer to the absorber and helps accumulate the electrons. It also allows high hole accumulation at the interface. Most importantly, CdS has been repeatedly found to be responsible for quantum efficiency drop in a short wavelength range (<550 nm) owing to the absorption of the blue portion of the solar spectrum.10,11 Its optical bandgap (Eg) (∼2.4 eV) is insufficient to allow short-wavelength light into the underlying absorber layer, which eventually deteriorates the short-circuit current (JSC). Also, such absorption loss reduces the average visible transmittance (AVT) for semi-transparent photovoltaics – an emerging variant of thin-film PVs.12 On the other hand, the toxicity of Cd and the vast amount of chemical waste it generates have become a growing concern regarding its use on an industrial scale.
To resolve the environmental issue, Cd-free wide-bandgap materials such as ZnS,13 (Zn,Mg)O,14 (Zn,Sn)O,15 and In2S316 have been extensively explored but their cell performance remains inferior compared to that of the Cd containing cells. A longer fabrication time owing to the slow deposition rate, the use of additional complexing agents (hydrazine hydrate, tri-sodium citrate and so forth), poor lattice matching with chalcogenide absorbers, and the formation of oxide and hydroxide impurities are commonly observed issues during Cd-free buffer formation.17 Also, the post-deposition treatment becomes necessary for these buffers to mitigate defects and interface recombination, which is a complex and time-consuming process for industrial applications.
As an alternative to CdS, Cd1−xZnxS has attracted great attention of the scientific community in the recent past.11 It has a similar crystal structure and comparable lattice constant to chalcopyrites and kesterites, leading to improved lattice matching. Furthermore, Zn's high solubility into CdS allows tuning of the bandgap to a desirable range by altering the Zn composition. Cd1−xZnxS has also been reported to reduce interface recombination by forming a spike-like CBO with the absorber, which hinders charge carrier accumulation at the interface.8
Cd1−xZnxS thin-films have been synthesized using various techniques such as vacuum evaporation,18 sputtering,19 electrodeposition,20 spin coating,21 dip coating,22 spray pyrolysis,23 successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction,8 close space sublimation24 and chemical bath deposition (CBD).11,25 Among these techniques, CBD – an industry standard for thin film solar cells – is the most favorable method owing to its simplicity, low process temperature, easy deposition over a large area and low cost for large-scale production.26 In the CBD method, the formation and quality of the film significantly depend on the process parameters – the concentration of reactant materials, temperature of the chemical bath, deposition time, pH of the solution and stirring rate. Several articles have been published where the effect of Zn concentration is reported.27,28 Some have reported the impact of the Cd concentration and the use of alternative sulfur sources instead of thiourea.25,28,29 It is commonly seen in various reports that the deposited films show different preferred orientations and morphology despite similar process parameters being used.27,30 Although a numerical study states that high Zn-containing buffer films in CIGS solar cells have the potential to achieve high photoconversion efficiency (PCE), research on high Zn-containing films is rarely found in the literature.31
Most notably, poor coverage is a common problem while fabricating Cd1−xZnxS films using the CBD technique, even with a low Zn content which becomes progressively more severe at a higher Zn content.29,32–36 Using the CBD method, Chavhan et al. found nano-sheet (x = 0.05), flake (x = 0.1) and curly nano-sheet (x = 0.15) morphologies in low Zn containing films.33 Also, a fully flower-like structure was found for a Cd0.8Zn0.2S film deposited using a bath with varying pH from 8.5 to 11 by Lilhare et al.36 Erturk et al. noticed pin-holes and cracks on the Cd1−xZnxS (x = 0.05) film surface20 while fabricating the films by electrodeposition.
Complete coverage of the substrate with a Cd1−xZnxS (x = 0.17) film (∼240 nm thick) has been achieved using the RF magnetron sputtering method for deposition.37 Similarly, a uniform, homogeneous ∼600 nm thick Cd1−xZnxS film has been reported where multiple layers of films (20 alternate layers of CdS (50 nm) and Zn (10 nm)) were deposited by evaporation followed by annealing, which is hardly suitable for industrial applications.18
In summary, the fabrication route of depositing pin-hole-free and flake-free, compact, fully covering Cd1−xZnxS films (0 < x < 1) is still unclear. Changing reactant concentration, solution temperature, and stirring rates may influence the film properties to some extent, but fabricating compact, fully covering films with desired structural, morphological and optical properties remains unpredictable. To get rid of undesired morphologies, orientation and poor coverage issues, controlling the formation mechanism of Cd1−xZnxS films for both low and high Zn contents is vital, where the pH of the solution can play a significant role. However, little attention has been paid to controlling the formation mechanism of Cd1−xZnxS films and pH of the chemical bath to date. In the CBD method, ammonia acts as a complexing agent and determines the solution's pH. In most of the studies, the solution pH is set arbitrarily (∼10–11) at the initial stage of the CBD process and not measured throughout the deposition despite the volatile nature of ammonia. Since the pH of the solution changes over the deposition time, any conclusive idea regarding its effects on the formation process and properties of Cd1−xZnxS films is unknown.
In this study, we fabricated uniform, compact, fully covering Cd1−xZnxS films (x = 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8) using the CBD technique using low amounts of reactants. We controlled the formation mechanism by varying the pH of the solution. To get a more accurate effect of pH on film formation and properties, we dynamically maintained the pH of the bath at fixed levels throughout the deposition period. Also, we investigated how different pH values of the chemical bath and varying Zn content simultaneously influence the formation mechanism. In addition, the correlation among pH, Zn content and the observed structural, morphological and optical properties is established with regard to the formation mechanism. We report Cd1−xZnxS films with superior optical properties – tunable bandgaps from 2.46 to 3.77 eV with AVT increasing from 51% to 85% (for x = 0 to 0.8).
We have discussed deposition conditions, characterization techniques and major chemical reactions governing the formation mechanisms in the experimental section. In the result and discussion part, microstructural characterization is discussed in connection with the formation mechanism at low, medium and high pH of the chemical bath, followed by EDS analysis. Next, the structure of the deposited films is analyzed. Then, the optical characterization section discusses the films’ transmittance and optical bandgap. Finally, we have summarized our findings in the conclusion section.
2 Experimental method
2.1 Preparation of solution grown films
Cd1−xZnxS (x = 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8) films were fabricated using the CBD technique where pH of the chemical bath was dynamically controlled (Supplementary note 1, ESI†). The CBD process is schematically presented in Fig. 1 and the process parameters used for fabrication are listed in Table 1. The details of the CBD film synthesis procedure are explained later in this section. In the CBD process, metal(II) and chalcogenide ions are released from their corresponding salt and organic compounds, respectively. In our work, cadmium sulfate, CdSO4 (Sigma-Aldrich ACS reagent ≥99.0%), zinc sulfate heptahydrate, ZnSO4·7H2O (Sigma-Aldrich ACS reagent ≥99.0%) and thiourea, SC(NH2)2 (Sigma-Aldrich ACS reagent ≥99.0%) were used as cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn) and sulfur (S) sources, respectively. Ammonia solution, NH4OH (25% w/w, Scharlab, Spain), was used as a complexing agent and to maintain the pH of the chemical bath. All chemicals were used as received without any further treatment. Three sets of samples were prepared at three different pH levels – 9.5 ± 0.06, 10 ± 0.06, and 10.5 ± 0.06 (discussed in Supplementary note 1, Fig. S1, ESI†). Each set comprised three Cd1−xZnxS ternary thin-films having different Zn compositions. Here, x is the zinc content and defined as the mole ratio used in the bath [Zn2+]/([Cd2+] + [Zn2+]). Films prepared with x = 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 are denoted as Cd0.8Zn0.2S, Cd0.5Zn0.5S and Cd0.2Zn0.8S, respectively. The amount of Cd in the solution was kept constant to separately identify the effect of Zn content on the growth technique and the properties of Cd1−xZnxS.

Cd1−xZnxS is formed after the dissociation of metastable complexes.

First, the soda-lime glass (SLG) substrate (76 mm × 16 mm × 1 mm) was successively cleaned with acetone and DI water for 20 minutes in an ultrasonic bath. 0.0003 mol of CdSO4 and the corresponding molar amount of ZnSO4·7H2O were taken in a 100 ml beaker and 50 ml of DI water was added. 0.003 mol of SC(NH2)2 was taken in another beaker and 30 ml of DI water was added to this beaker. The beaker containing the metal salt solution was placed on a hot plate and stirred at 200 rpm using a magnetic stirrer. The substrate was attached to a jaw clamp using a standing rod to keep it immersed in the solution. After adding a few drops of NH4OH, the transparent solution became milky white, and further addition of NH4OH made the solution transparent again. At this stage, 2 ml of NH4OH was added to the solution. A thermometer and pH meter were attached to the standing rod to monitor the temperature and pH of the solution, respectively. When the temperature reached 80 °C and the pH of the solution reached the desired levels (Table 1), thiourea solution and NH4OH were added drop-wise using two different pipettes, maintaining the target temperature and pH level as per Table 1. After adding thiourea, the transparent solution slowly turned into a pale yellow colored solution. By adding NH4OH intermittently, the pH of the solution was dynamically controlled at specific values (Table 1) throughout the deposition time (Fig. S1, Supplementary note 1, ESI†). After 40 minutes of adding thiourea solution, the substrate was removed from the bath and rinsed with DI water to remove loosely adhered particles, followed by drying in the air. Finally, the substrate was wrapped in aluminum foil and preserved in a vacuum desiccator for characterization.
2.2 Measurement and characterization
The crystallographic structure of the prepared films was analyzed using an X-ray diffractometer (Empyrean PANalytical, Netherlands) using a Braggg-Brentano high definition optical setup on the incident beam side and a proportional detector in the diffracted beam optics. The X-ray source tube was operated at 45 kV and 40 mA, and the monochromator assembly in the incident beam optics selectively filtered CuKα1,2 lines of 1.5406 Å and 1.5444 Å wavelengths. The diffraction spectrum was collected within a 2θ range of 20°–80° with a scan speed of 0.05° per second. The microstructure and morphology of the films were analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM: JEOL JSM 7600F, Japan). The compositional analysis was carried out by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) with an acceleration voltage of 10 kV. The optical characterization was performed using a UV-vis-NIR spectrometer (LAMBDA 1050, PerkinElmer, USA) with a three detector module (TDM) in the wavelength range of 300–800 nm.
2.3 Reaction and growth mechanism
In CBD, chemical reactions greatly influence the formation of thin films. There are two formation mechanisms:38 (i) homogeneous formation (by homogeneous reaction or a cluster-by-cluster method) and (ii) heterogeneous formation (by heterogeneous reaction or an ion exchange method) (Fig. 1). Both reaction mechanisms can potentially occur during film deposition, but depending on the process conditions, one mechanism dominates over the other. The film properties strongly depend on the dominating mechanism. Dense and well-adhered films generally form from heterogeneous reaction, whereas homogeneous reaction leads to the formation of porous and less-adherent films. The key reactions that dictate the progress of both kinds of mechanisms are described as follows:
At first, metal salts are dissolved in DI water and form hydrated ion complexes.39 Zn/Cd(SO4) + H2O → [Zn/Cd(H2O)]2+ + SO42−(1)
The transparent solution turns white in color after adding a few drops of ammonia as some hydrated metal ion complexes form a solid phase of metal hydroxide in the solution.40 [Zn/Cd(H2O)]2+ + NH4OH → Zn/Cd(OH)2(2)Further addition of ammonia makes the white solution transparent again by forming metal–amino complexes. The complex ion formation retards the precipitation of Zn/Cd(OH)2. Zn/Cd(OH)2 + NH4OH → Zn/Cd(NH3)n2+(3)where n is the coordination number of the zinc/cadmium–amino complexes varying from 1 to 6 depending on the concentration of ammonia.41 The most stable coordination number is 4.
Subsequent reactions greatly depend on the amount of ammonia and/or pH of the solution, and the type of subsequent reactions determines the formation mechanism.
For the homogeneous mechanism, two terms are relevant: ionic product (Q) and solubility product (ksp). ksp is the equilibrium constant describing the product of the concentrations of ions present in a saturated solution, whereas Q is the measure of the product of the concentrations of ions present in either an unsaturated or a saturated solution.42 When Q > ksp, the solution becomes supersaturated and precipitation of the substance takes place. When the amount of ammonia and/or pH of the solution is relatively low, the number of metal ions (Cd2+ and Zn2+) released from their corresponding amino complexes increases. Also, S2− ions are released from alkaline hydrolysis of thiourea. If the ksp of metal sulfides (Zn/CdS) is exceeded, (ksp,CdS = 10−28 and ksp,ZnS = 10−25), the existing free ions (Cd2+, Zn2+ and S2−) form metal sulfide particles in the solution.43 These particles form clusters and eventually adsorb on the substrate surface to form Cd1−xZnxS films – a process known as the homogeneous formation mechanism. Reactions involved in this mechanism can be written as follows:38,44 Cd(NH3)n2+ ⇌ Cd2+ + nNH3(4) Zn(NH3)n2+ ⇌ Zn2+ + nNH3(5) SC(NH2)2 + 2OH− ⇌ S2− + CN2H2 + 2H2O(6)The growth of Cd1−xZnxS films greatly depends on these metal–amino complex ions' stability constants (C). As Zn(NH3)n2+ (CZn ∼ 108.9) is more stable than Cd(NH3)n2+ (CCd ∼ 106.9), Zn2+ ions are released at a slower rate compared to Cd2+ ions.45 Also, since ksp,CdS < ksp,ZnS, the formation of ZnS is slower compared to CdS. Thus, C of metal-amino complexes and ksp of metal sulfides substantially control the nucleation and overall growth of Cd1−xZnxS films.
The total reaction can be written as (1 − x)Cd(NH3)n2+ + xZn(NH3)n2+ + SC(NH2)2 + 2OH− → Cd1−xZnxS + CN2H2 + nNH3 + 2H2O(7)When the amount of ammonia (and therefore the pH of the solution) is high, the release rate of metal ions is decreased and heterogeneous formation dominates. In this case, metal–amino complexes (Cd(NH3)n2+ and Zn(NH3)n2+) react with OH− ions on the surface of the substrate and form dihydroxo–metal and dihydroxo-diamino–metal complexes, which get adsorbed on the substrate surface. After reacting with thiourea, intermediate metastable complexes are formed, followed by the decomposition of these complexes and deposition of Cd1−xZnxS films. This mechanism is known as the heterogeneous formation mechanism. The relevant reactions are as follows:38,44 Zn/Cd(NH3)42+ + 2OH− ⇌ [Zn/Cd(OH)2]ads(8) Zn/Cd(NH3)42+ + 2OH− ⇌ [Zn/Cd(OH)2(NH3)2]ads + 2NH3(9)After the adsorption of thiourea, these complexes form intermediate metastable complexes. [Zn/Cd(OH)2]ads + SC(NH2)2 ⇌ [Zn/Cd(OH)2SC(NH2)2]ads(10) [Zn/Cd(OH)2(NH3)2]ads + SC(NH2)2 ⇌ [Zn/Cd(OH)2(NH3)2SC(NH2)2]ads(11)Finally, the Cd1−xZnxS film forms after the decomposition of metastable complexes. [Zn/Cd(OH)2SC(NH2)2]ads → Cd1−xZnxS + CN2H2 + 2H2O(12) [Zn/Cd(OH)2(NH3)2SC(NH2)2]ads → Cd1−xZnxS + CN3H5 + NH3 + 2H2O(13)
3 Result and discussion
3.1 Microstructural characterization

Fig. 2(a)–(i) shows the SEM micrographs of surface morphologies of all samples and cross-sectional views (inset) with corresponding thickness values. The micrographs indicate a strong correlation between film morphology and the bath's pH and Zn content. An inverse relationship is found between Zn content and the required pH level for obtaining fully covering compact films (Fig. 3). In a high Zn concentration bath (x = 0.8), coverage gradually falls to ∼25% with increasing pH of the bath from 9.5 to 10.5. Similarly, in a high-pH bath (10.5), coverage gradually decreases with increasing Zn content. Compact films are observed for Cd0.2Zn0.8S pH – 9.5 (Fig. 2(c)), Cd0.5Zn0.5S pH – 10 (Fig. 2(e)) and Cd0.8Zn0.2S pH – 10.5 (Fig. 2(g)). These films are considered optimum samples and the thickness of the films slightly varies in the range of 160–180 nm. Incomplete coverage is observed in Cd0.2Zn0.8S pH – 10, Cd0.5Zn0.5S pH – 10.5 and Cd0.2Zn0.8S pH – 10.5 samples since the pH levels are not sufficiently low. There are some flakes noticed in Cd0.8Zn0.2S pH – 10 and Cd0.5Zn0.5S pH – 9.5. Such a phenomenon is observed when the pH is lower than optimum levels. In the flake structures, the film thickness (without flakes) is found to be lower compared to their compact counterpart. It is also evident that for each Zn composition, average particle size increases with pH of the bath as depicted in Fig. 4. The particle size distribution is shown in Fig. S2 of Supplementary note 2, ESI.† The average particle size of optimum samples varies from 56 to 75 nm (Fig. 4).

(c), (e) and (g) show the desired morphology of a buffer layer in PVs. High pH for low Zn and low pH for high Zn is optimum. 
 Fig. 3  Coverage of the substrate surface with Cd1−xZnxS films deposited at different pH levels. In general, coverage deteriorates with high pH values; however, the onset of the reduction in coverage depends on the Zn content. Higher Zn content shows a more rapid decrease in coverage with pH. Cd0.8Zn0.2S films cover the whole substrate at any pH. Cd0.5Zn0.5S films deposited at pH – 10.5 do not completely cover the substrate. Very low coverage is noticed for high Zn content films at high pH. 
 Fig. 4  Average particle size of deposited samples with corresponding standard deviation. In all samples, the average particle size increases with the increasing pH of the solution. Slow release of metal ions may favor the coalescence of particles to be enlarged. 

3.1.1 Deposition mechanism at low pH. 
The observed microstructures are greatly related to the formation mechanism. SEM images of Cd0.8Zn0.2S, Cd0.5Zn0.5S and Cd0.2Zn0.8S films deposited at pH – 9.5 are depicted in Fig. 2(a)–(c). The Cd0.8Zn0.2S film is not dense and has a high degree of porosity. Particles are interconnected and form clusters with numerous voids. The morphology indicates the rapid accumulation of (Cd,Zn)S clusters formed in the solution on the substrate surface. The uncontrolled precipitation of (Cd,Zn)S on the substrate takes place due to the fast release of metal ions from their corresponding complexes, which can also be corroborated by the large thickness of the film (∼870 nm) as seen in the cross-sectional view (inset). When the amount of ammonia is low in the bath (low pH), metal–amino complexes become less stable; hence, more metal ions are released immediately, according to eqn (4) and (5). On the other hand, as soon as thiourea is supplied to the reaction system (eqn (7)), the concentration of free metals and sulfur ions exceeds the ksp of metal sulfides (as discussed earlier), and homogeneous formation occurs. Thus, the homogeneous reaction is the dominating mechanism for the formation of low Zn–Cd1−xZnxS films under low pH conditions.
A relatively continuous and non-porous film is obtained for Cd0.5Zn0.5S compared to Cd0.8Zn0.2S. However, a flake structure is noticed for moderate Zn content films, which is also commonly reported in the literature.46–48 Liu et al.47 observed a flake structure in CdS while fabricating it in a low ammonia (0.1–0.4 M) solution; Patil et al.46 reported the same structure when using different complexing agents-ammonia and triethylamine whereas Kamble et al.48 attributed the high S–Cd ratio to the formation of this structure. Hence, the exact reason for the flake formation is yet to be reported. However, it is reported that flakes form at the initial stage of the deposition process when the reaction rate is high.49 With time, the reaction rate decreases due to the consumption of precursor ions during flake formation, which later leads to the formation of quasi-spherical particles on flakes and the substrate surface.49 Due to the higher amount of Zn compared to that in the Cd0.8Zn0.2S system, most of the supplied ammonia is used to form the Zn–amino complex. So, the amount of Cd–amino complex/free Cd ions is reduced in the Cd0.5Zn0.5S system, eventually limiting the random precipitation of (Cd,Zn)S observed in the Cd0.8Zn0.2S film. After adding thiourea in the bath, the free Cd ions released from the amino complexes (according to eqn (4)) are used up for the flake formation, which reduces the homogeneous reaction rate. Therefore, low pH in the presence of a moderate amount of Zn is a favorable condition for the onset of heterogeneous reaction in the Cd0.5Zn0.5S film.
Intriguingly, Cd0.2Zn0.8S films at pH 9.5 have a smooth, continuous, and dense surface morphology as desired for a buffer layer. The film fully covers the glass substrate and has no pinholes. Pinhole-free, compact film formation is also evident from the cross-sectional view. The presence of a higher amount of Zn compared to Cd implies the formation of an increased amount of Zn–amino complexes compared to the Cd–amino complex in the bath, which slows down the release of free metal ions compared to lower Zn films. As a result, the amount of free metal and sulfur ions is inadequate to surpass the ksp of CdS and ZnS. This considerably retards the immediate precipitation of (Cd,Zn)S and facilitates the heterogeneous reaction. Metal–amino complexes adsorb on the substrate surface and form reaction sites as per eqn (8) and (9). Then, non-hydrolyzed thiourea forms intermediate metastable complexes (eqn (10) and (11)) and eventually form compact films according to eqn (12) and (13). Therefore, low pH is found to be suitable for the heterogeneous reaction and a viable route for the formation of high Zn containing Cd1−xZnxS films, free from the coverage area problem widely reported in the literature.10,25,36


3.1.2 Deposition mechanism at moderate pH. 
Surface micrographs with cross-sections (inset) of Cd0.8Zn0.2S, Cd0.5Zn0.5S and Cd0.2Zn0.8S films deposited at pH – 10 are depicted in Fig. 2(d)–(f). For the same amount of reactants for Cd0.8Zn0.2S formation, a porous film is found at pH – 9.5, whereas a smooth film with a flake structure is obtained at pH – 10. In the Cd0.8Zn0.2S films deposited at pH – 10, the higher amount of ammonia compared to that in the chemical bath with pH – 9.5 stabilizes metal–amino complexes and regulates the amount of free metal ions (as per eqn (4) and (5). Thus, a flake structure is formed instead of rapidly accumulating (Cd,Zn)S clusters. Flakes form immediately after thiourea addition owing to the fast reaction rate in the presence of a sufficient amount of initially released free Cd ions.49 Afterward, the reaction rate decreases owing to the limited release of Cd ions from relatively stable Cd–amino complexes compared to pH – 9.5. Also, the release of Zn ions is limited from Zn–amino complexes due to their relatively higher stability (CZn ∼ 108.9), and therefore, the heterogeneous reaction dominates. A similar flake structure is noticed in the Cd0.5Zn0.5S film deposited at pH – 9.5. In the Cd0.5Zn0.5S film, more ammonia is used up for Zn–amino complex formation owing to the presence of a higher amount of Zn compared to that in the Cd0.8Zn0.2S system. It reduces the formation of Cd–amino complexes/free Cd ions and triggers the heterogeneous reaction after flake formation, as described earlier. Thus, the presence of a high amount of Zn in Cd0.5Zn0.5S pH – 9.5 bath regulates the amount of free Cd ions, whereas the high amount of ammonia and relatively stable Cd–amino complexes regulate the amount of free Cd ions in Cd0.8Zn0.2S, pH – 10 bath. Therefore, similar structures are observed at two different compositions and pH values.
For Cd0.5Zn0.5S, pH – 10 yields highly dense, compact and uniform film morphology (Fig. 2e). The film is continuous and covers the substrate surface uniformly. As the amount of Zn precursor is higher than Cd0.8Zn0.2S, the amount of free Cd ion is also lower in Cd0.5Zn0.5S film and hence no flake is formed in Cd0.5Zn0.5S film after adding thiourea to the reaction bath.
Full areal coverage is not achieved for Cd0.2Zn0.8S films deposited at pH – 10 (Fig. 2f), even though the other process parameters are the same as x = 0.5. We see that particles deposit on the nucleation sites, but the nucleation does not take place uniformly on the substrate surface. Thus, it can be inferred that more ammonia is used up in forming Zn–amino complexes, and hence the amount of Cd–amino complex is reduced in Cd0.2Zn0.8S films, which may result in reduced nucleation sites on the substrate surface. As the Cd–amino complex is more stable at pH – 10 compared to pH – 9.5 due to the higher amount of ammonia in the bath, the amount of adsorbed Cd hydroxide and dihydroxo-diamino–Cd complexes is also reduced compared to the Cd0.2Zn0.8S, pH – 9.5 system. Moreover, Zn ions are released more slowly compared to Cd ions from the corresponding complexes, so the necessary amount of complexes is not adsorbed over the deposition time to achieve full coverage.


3.1.3 Deposition at high pH. 

Fig. 2(g)–(i) illustrates the top-view and cross-sectional view (inset) of all films deposited at pH – 10.5. High pH has been found to control the rapid and/or vast release of free metal ions from their complexes, and hence a uniform, compact film without any porous or flake structure is obtained in the Cd0.8Zn0.2S system. A pinhole-free, fully covering film is indispensable for thin-film PVs, and this film shows an appropriate morphology for a buffer layer.
At pH – 10.5, full coverage is not achieved for Cd0.5Zn0.5S films, and the coverage percentage is further reduced to ∼25% in the Cd0.2Zn0.8S film. As explained earlier, the amount of Cd–amino complex is reduced because more ammonia is used up in forming Zn–amino complexes in Cd0.5Zn0.5S and Cd0.2Zn0.8S systems. Also, the amount of adsorbed dihydroxo–metal and dihydroxo-diamino–metal complexes is reduced in a pH – 10.5 bath compared to a pH – 10 bath as the metal–amino complexes are more stable in a more ammonia-containing bath. So for the Cd0.5Zn0.5S system, a compact film is obtained at pH – 10, but ∼80% coverage is achieved at pH – 10.5 in the same deposition time due to inadequate availability of adsorbed complexes on the substrate surface. Similarly, in the Cd0.2Zn0.8S system, ∼70% coverage is achieved at pH – 10, whereas only 25% of the substrate surface is covered at pH – 10.5. As reported in ref. 50 and 51, a high amount of ammonia and/or pH is favorable for the cluster by cluster growth of the film. However, it is evident that the the poor coverage of Cd0.5Zn0.5S and Cd0.2Zn0.8S films can be attributed to the insufficiency of adsorbed complexes from their corresponding stable amino complexes in a high pH bath. Hence, the heterogeneous reaction, and not the cluster by cluster method, dominates at high pH. It can be further substantiated from the deposition of Cd0.8Zn0.2S film in a low pH (9.5) bath where random aggregation of (Cd, Zn)S clusters plays the governing role over heterogeneous formation.

Fig. 5 shows the typical representative EDS patterns of three fully covering Cd1−xZnxS films. Although there are some detection limits (<0.01 wt%) of the technique, this analysis provides important qualitative information regarding major and minor elements of the samples along with some quantitative results.52 In this study, EDS analysis was performed by probing ten different points on the sample surface. The obtained results are tabulated in Table S1 of Supplementary note 3, ESI.† According to Fig. 5 and Table S1 (ESI†), it is apparent that Cd, Zn and S, all three elements are present in all Cd1−xZnxS films. Apart from these elements, some peaks of oxygen and silicon are also observed in the spectrum. These elements can be detected from the glass substrate as the striking electrons penetrate deep into the film and interact with the substrate. The claim can be validated from the relationship between the penetration depth and accelerating voltage for a given material, as discussed in Supplementary note 4, ESI.† Considering CdS and ZnS, the penetration depth is approximately estimated to be at least ∼1.2 μm and ∼1.5 μm respectively. Hence, given the film thickness, the interaction of striking electrons with the substrate is apparent. Zn content of the films, prepared at any pH, increases at least qualitatively as we gradually increase the Zn precursor content in the starting precursor solution from Cd0.8Zn0.2S to Cd0.2Zn0.8S. Also, the increase in Zn amount in the optimum films can be corroborated by the subsequent effects on the structural and optical properties, which are discussed later.

3.2 Structural characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) line profiles of Cd1−xZnxS films fabricated in solutions of three distinct pH values are depicted in Fig. 6(a) 9.5, (b) 10 and (c) 10.5. The obtained structural parameters are listed in Tables 2 and 3. All samples show three characteristic peaks within the 2θ range of 20° to 80° except sample Cd0.8Zn0.2S – 9.5 which shows two additional identical peaks (indexed accordingly). All samples show a broad background hump between 20° to 40° owing to the amorphous glass substrate. The patterns match well with the wurtzite structure of CdS (ICSD 98-015-4187). A similar structure has also been commonly reported11,29 and recognized as the hexagonal phase of CdS. In all samples, the most intense peak is observed for the (002) crystallographic plane at ∼26.6°, which indicates that they have preferred orientation along the c-axis of the wurtzite structure. The other two peaks observed at ∼44.1° and ∼52.5° correspond to (110) and (112) reflection planes, respectively. These peaks imply the polycrystalline nature of the film.
 Fig. 6  X-ray diffraction patterns of Cd1−xZnxS films deposited at different pH values (a) 9.5 – random accumulation of particles in Cd0.8Zn0.2S results in two additional peaks with a (002) peak, (b) 10 – films show preferential orientation along the (002) plane and (c) 10.5 – high intense, sharp peak in Cd0.8Zn0.2S films. At all pH values, the intensity of peaks declines with increasing Zn content. A relatively broad peak base is observed for Cd0.2Zn0.8S pH – 10, Cd0.5Zn0.5S pH – 10.5 and Cd0.2Zn0.8S pH – 10.5 films, which have low coverage as shown in Fig. 2.

There is a close correlation between structural and morphological characteristics. In Cd0.8Zn0.2S films (at pH – 9.5), random accumulation of particles (cluster by cluster method dominates) results in the deposition of bulk, porous films, and so two other peaks of (010) and (011) planes are observed along with the peak of the (002) plane. The intensity of the (002) peak is significantly improved with increasing pH and these extra peaks are not found in two other Cd0.8Zn0.2S films. The relatively intense and sharp peak of the (002) plane is also observed in Cd0.5Zn0.5S pH – 10 and Cd0.2Zn0.8S pH – 9.5 compared to other similar Zn containing films deposited at different pH values. Thus, it is evident that the (002) plane is the most preferential orientation for Cd1−xZnxS film growth regardless of the formation mechanism, while the crystallinity improves when heterogeneous formation dominates during film deposition. No other peaks arising from oxides and hydroxides are observed in the patterns. At all three pH values, the peak intensity gradually decreases with increasing Zn content, which is in agreement with an earlier report.29

Tables 2 and 3 show some crucial structural parameters calculated as described in the following. These parameters demonstrate the impact of Zn content and bath pH. The peak broadenings are directly related to the crystallite size and micro-strain of the samples. The average crystallite size (Davg) is calculated using Debye Scherrer's formula53 (14)where K = 0.89, λ is the wavelength of CuKα (0.1541 nm), β represents the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peak in radian and θ is the Bragg angle. The FWHM of XRD peaks is extracted using the pseudo-Voigt function fitting of the diffraction profiles. Micro-strain (ε) is calculated from structural broadening using ε = β/(4tanθ).53 The crystallite size greatly depends on the dominant formation mechanism. When the pH of the solution gradually increases from 9.5 to 10.5, Cd0.8Zn0.2S film formation reaction changes from homogeneous to heterogeneous type. Hence, the film morphology transforms from porous to dense and compact. The crystallinity, as a result, increases and the peak of the (002) plane becomes more intense and Davg increases by ∼77% from 5.64 nm to ∼10 nm. Also, microstrain decreases by ∼52%. The slow release of free metal ions slows down the film growth, favoring the reduction of interface energies to merge crystallites. Similarly, a slight improvement in crystallinity (∼8%) is observed when Cd0.5Zn0.5S film morphology changes from a flake structure (at pH – 9.5) to a flake-free compact structure (at pH – 10). An unsystematic change in Davg may be found in Cd0.2Zn0.8S films due to poor coverage.
Although Debye Scherrer's equation is commonly used for determining crystallite size, it does not account for the lattice strain for peak broadening. In the Williamson–Hall (W–H) method, the total broadening of the XRD peak is considered to be the combined effect of both crystallite size and lattice strain as follows: (15)By rearranging the above equation: (16)Taking βcosθ as a function of 4sinθ, W–H plots can be obtained for all samples. Fig. 7 shows the W–H plot for Cd0.8Zn0.2S films deposited at pH – 10.5. The extracted DWH and εWH values of all samples are tabulated in Table 2.
 Fig. 7  W–H plot of Cd0.8Zn0.2S films deposited at pH – 10.5. The slope of the plot denotes εWH and δWH is calculated from the intercept. εWH and δWH of other films are also estimated from the corresponding W–H plot. 
Although these values differ from previous Debye Scherrer's formula-derived values, the overall trend remains the same. The crystallinity improves for films grown in a bath where the heterogeneous reaction dominates. Also, the crystallinity decreases with increasing Zn content from Cd0.8Zn0.2S to Cd0.2Zn0.8S which is consistent with earlier reports.29,37 The decrease in crystallinity with incorporation of Zn can be attributed to increased strain arising from lattice contraction, as evident from lattice parameters (a and c) in Table 3. Lattice constants of a hexagonal structure are calculated as follows: (17)The lattice contraction is related to the substitutional incorporation of Zn2+ ions (0.74 Å) in place of Cd2+ ions (0.97 Å) in a lattice structure.54 For heterogeneously formed Cd1−xZnxS films, EDS analysis indicates a gradual increase in Zn atom% with an increase in x, and thereby, the cell volume also contracts slightly, shown in Fig. 9.
Lattice strain is found to retard the crystal growth by diminishing the driving force for grain growth.55 Thus, increasing strain owing to Zn incorporation is a possible reason for the declining crystallite size in the optimum samples. The reason for decreasing crystallite size with increasing Zn content can be qualitatively corroborated by determining two other structural parameters: texture coefficient (Tc) and stacking fault (SF).
Texture coefficient is a measure of preferential orientation along a particular (hkl) plane, calculated using the following formula:27 (18)where, I(hkl) is the measured intensity of the (hkl) plane, I0(hkl) is the standard intensity of the (hkl) plane and N is the number of reflection. The calculated texture coefficient for the (002) plane (Tc(002)) is tabulated in Table 3. If (i) Tc > 1 – particles have preferred orientation along the particular (hkl) plane, (ii) Tc ∼ 1 for every (hkl) plane, then particles are randomly oriented, and (iii) 0 < Tc < 1 – there is a lack of grains orientated along the (hkl) plane. It is evident that Cd1−xZnxS shows preferential growth along the (002) plane regardless of the growth mechanism. However, higher Tc(002) is found for films that are grown in a bath where heterogeneous reaction dominates (Cd0.2Zn0.8S pH – 9.5, Cd0.5Zn0.5S pH – 10 and Cd0.8Zn0.2S pH – 10.5) compared to films with a similar Zn content deposited in other baths. Also, for heterogeneously formed films, Tc(002) decreases (∼12%) with increasing Zn content, which could possibly imply that more nuclei may have preferentially grown along the crystallographic planes other than (002). Therefore, the simultaneous growth of nuclei having different preferred orientations could arrest their growth in different directions due to crystal interlocking. Hence, the crystallite size is reduced in Cd0.2Zn0.8S films compared to Cd0.8Zn0.2S films.
The stacking fault (SF) values are estimated from the following equation:56 (19)The calculated values are given in Table 3. The SF value is a qualitative indication of lattice imperfections. For Cd0.8Zn0.2S films, SF decreases significantly from ∼0.012 (at pH 9.5) to ∼0.006 (at pH 10.5) by ∼50% when the film formation mechanism transforms from homogeneous to heterogeneous. It suggests that controlling the growth mechanism is essential for minimizing lattice imperfections. Fig. 8 shows the summary of structural parameters of heterogeneously grown Cd1−xZnxS films. On incorporating Zn in Cd1−xZnxS films, Tc(002) is decreased, which implies that nuclei also tend to grow on planes other than (002). This can be corroborated by the increased SF value with increasing Zn content. Accordingly, δWH and εWH increase. Therefore, the growth of nuclei is retarded from attaining long-range order, and hence, DWH decreases with Zn incorporation.
 Fig. 8  Relationship among structural parameters of heterogeneously grown optimum Cd1−xZnxS films. The texture coefficient along the (002) plane decreases with increasing Zn content, resulting in increased stacking fault, dislocation density and lattice strain. Consequently, a gradual decrease in crystallite size is observed with the incorporation of Zn.

3.3 Optical characterization

3.3.1 Transmittance. 

Fig. 10(a)–(c) shows the transmittance spectra of CBD grown Cd1−xZnxS films fabricated at different pH levels. The coverage area of the samples is shown in parentheses. The heterogeneously grown samples – (Cd0.8Zn0.2S at pH – 10.5, Cd0.5Zn0.5S at pH – 10 and Cd0.2Zn0.8S at pH – 9.5) – that showed the best morphological attributes also showed the most suitable optical performance. The transmission is high (>80%) above the wavelength (λg) corresponding to the bandgap and the transition from low to high transmission at λg is reasonably sharp for these three samples. There is still some transmission below λg since the thickness of the samples is less than 200 nm and the photons are not fully absorbed. The buffer layers with similar transmittance levels have been commonly reported to be successfully used in CIGS and CdTe PV devices.29,51,57 Similarly, despite having flakes in the morphology, Cd0.5Zn0.5S at pH – 9.5 and Cd0.8Zn0.2S at pH – 10 exhibit ∼60–70% and ∼50–60% transmittance, respectively, over 500 nm. Although Zn content is different in these two films, the morphology and transmittance patterns are similar. Films with >70% coverage (Cd0.2Zn0.8S at pH – 10 and Cd0.5Zn0.5S at pH – 10.5) show a similar transmittance pattern regardless of the Zn content.
 Fig. 10  Transmittance spectra of the CBD grown films with corresponding coverage area percentage in the parenthesis (a–c). Films with identical morphology show similar transmittance patterns regardless of pH and Zn content of the solutions. Heterogeneously grown films show steep absorption edges, indicating the uniformity and compactness of the films. Homogeneously grown porous samples show poor transmittance due to the higher absorption caused by their porous microstructure. A similar transmission pattern is observed in flake structures. (d) Photopic response of the human eye with heterogeneously grown optimum film transmittance spectra. The spectrum of CdS is taken from our previous work.26 Calculated AVTs are mentioned in the parenthesis. AVT significantly increases from 51% to 85% with increasing Zn content. 
On the other hand, homogeneously formed Cd0.8Zn0.2S at pH – 9.5 has a high degree of porosity owing to the rapid accumulation of clusters. Due to the high porosity and small grain size leading to grain boundary scattering and subsequent absorption, the transmittance is lower (above bandgap) than that of heterogeneously grown samples. The same trend can be seen in samples F and H. The general characteristics of these samples are very low transmission (high absorption) below λg followed by a slow increase in transmission above λg.
AVT is a crucial factor to be considered for certain applications such as STPV, which is calculated as follows:58 (20)where P is the photopic response of the human eye (responsive between 380 and 700 nm), S is the solar flux (W m−2 nm−1) for AM1.5G spectrum and T is the transmission through the coated glass from the measurements. Fig. 10d illustrates the optimized films' transmittance along with the human eye's photopic response. The calculated AVT values based on the measured transmittance spectra are mentioned in the parenthesis. The transmittance spectrum of CdS is taken from our previous report.26 A significant improvement in AVT is noticed when Zn is incorporated into the films. AVT is increased from 51% (pristine CdS) to 75% in Cd0.8Zn0.2S and 82.5% in Cd0.5Zn0.5S films, and then 85% in the Cd0.2Zn0.8S film. ∼60 nm thick CdS films – commonly used in CIGS STPV – exhibit ∼70% AVT.26,59 As CdS absorbs the blue portion of the solar spectrum, it decreases the efficiency of PV devices below 550 nm.11 Therefore, the improved AVT of Cd1−xZnxS films suggests the potential of these films for STPV devices. The improved AVT of the buffer layer is expected to increase the efficiency and make it particularly suitable for semi-transparent photovoltaics.59
The increase in AVT with Zn incorporation implies that more high-energy photons can pass through the films as the absorption edge of the films is shifted towards shorter wavelengths. This phenomenon can be substantiated with the cutoff wavelength obtained from the absorption coefficient (α) shown in Fig. 11. α is calculated with the equation: ; where d is the film thickness and T is the transmittance of the film.
 Fig. 11  Absorption coefficient as a function of wavelength. The optical loss decreases with the increase in wavelength and the transition in absorption loss is related to the optical bandgap of the films. The absorption edge shifts to a shorter wavelength with increasing Zn content. 
The value of α decreases with increasing wavelength for all samples. A similar absorption pattern is also observed in ref. 37. The cutoff wavelengths can be obtained from the point of intersection between the tangent line and X-axis for each spectrum and are found to decrease with the increase in Zn content. Therefore, more photons can reach the absorber layer, penetrating the buffer film. The most possible reason behind the decrease in cut-off wavelength as per Zn incorporation is the increase in the optical bandgap of the deposited samples discussed in the following section.


3.3.2 Optical bandgaps. 
In this section, we describe the extraction of the optical bandgap (Eg). A high bandgap is desired for a buffer layer, which ensures the passage of photons to the absorber material. Eg can be determined from the absorption edge of the transmission spectrum. The relation between α and the photon energy (hν) can be obtained using Tauc's equation in the high absorption region:53 αhν = A(hν − Eg)m(21)where A is a constant and m is the power factor depending on the mode of transition. For allowed direct transition, m = 1/2 and the equation becomes (αhν)2 = A(hν − Eg)(22)
The bandgap can be determined by extrapolating the tangent to the linear portion of the (αhν)2vs. hν plot known as the Tauc plot. Fig. 12(a)–(f) illustrates the extraction of Eg for all fully covering samples. The full coverage of the buffer layer is essential to estimate the films' bandgap as the bandgap discrepancy is observed for the films with poor coverage (Fig. S3 in Supplementary note 5, ESI†). With increasing pH of the solution, Eg is increased in Cd0.8Zn0.2S and Cd0.5Zn0.5S films. The improvement is closely related to the growth mechanism and film morphology. At low pH (9.5), homogeneous formation dominates in Cd0.8Zn0.2S and the resulting surface roughness and crystal defects – such as pores, interfaces, and dislocations – create the pathway to defect states within the bandgap. The minimization of these defect states with increasing pH and heterogeneous formation results in higher Eg (Fig. 12c) from 2.43 eV to 2.55 eV for Cd0.8Zn0.2S. Similar improvement is seen in Cd0.5Zn0.5S and Cd0.2Zn0.8S samples (Fig. 12d–f).
 Fig. 12  (a–f) Tauc plots of the fully covering Cd1−xZnxS films deposited at different pH levels (mentioned in the parenthesis). With increasing pH, heterogeneous formation dominates over homogeneous one and the bandgap, Eg, of Cd0.8Zn0.2S and Cd0.5Zn0.5S increases. In heterogeneously grown optimum films, Eg significantly increases from 2.55 eV to 3.77 eV with increasing Zn content. 
We have achieved a bandgap of 2.55 eV for Cd0.8Zn0.2S using a low amount of precursor materials (0.0003 mol of Cd and 0.000075 mol of Zn source). To put this in context – previously reported bandgaps from the CBD method include Eg = 2.4 eV for Cd0.72Zn0.28S,8Eg = 2.5 eV for Cd0.6Zn0.4S27 and Eg = 2.55 eV for Cd0.6Zn0.4S. Most of these works used much higher Zn content and a high amount of precursor concentration (such as 0.03 M Cd and 0.02 M Zn sources in ref. 28) to achieve a bandgap close to 2.5 eV.
A further increase in the bandgap is achieved by increasing the Zn content. With x = 0.8, we achieve a bandgap of 3.77 eV. This is the highest reported bandgap among CBD-grown Cd1−xZnxS films with acceptable morphological attributes for PV applications. Yao et al. reported the synthesis of uniform films using CBD with a bandgap of 3.06 eV.28 Others reported films with x = 0.8 with a bandgap around ∼3.6 eV.25,35,60 However, most of them have either non-uniform deposition or had flakes.
Also, as shown in Fig. 12(b)–(e), there exists a step change in the Tauc plots, which may arise from the formation of Cd-rich compounds. As the Cd–amino complex is less stable compared to the Zn–amino complex, there exists a higher amount of adsorbed dihydroxo-diamino–Cd and/or dihydroxo–Cd complexes, leading to the formation of Cd-rich compounds. As a result, a step change close to the bandgap of CdS is observed. In the Zn-rich film (Fig. 12f), since the amount of the Zn source, is considerably higher than that of the Cd source in the precursor solution, the amount of adsorbed Cd complexes is lower compared to Cd-rich counterparts. Therefore, the possibility of forming Cd-rich compound decreases, and unlike other films, no step change is found in the Tauc plot of the Zn-rich film.
The variation of Eg and AVT with Zn content and optimum solution pH in the heterogeneously grown films are depicted in Fig. 13. With increasing Zn content, Cd1−xZnxS films with improved optical and morphological properties are obtained when the pH of the bath is decreased. Solely by controlling the pH of the bath, the coverage issue of Cd1−xZnxS films, even for high Zn content, is resolved. Eg gradually increases from 2.46 (CdS) to 2.77 (Cd0.5Zn0.5S) and, then, significantly increases to 3.77 eV (Cd0.2Zn0.8S) with increasing Zn percentage of the precursor solution. The quadratic fit of the extracted bandgap data as a function of the Zn mole fraction yields the following expression (Fig. S4 in Supplementary note 6, ESI†): Eg = 0.88x2 + 0.67x + 2.4(23)There is no reported expression for the bandgap as a function of the Zn mole fraction, x, for CBD grown Cd1−xZnxS films. Our extracted coefficient of x2 – the bowing parameter – is close to the values reported in ref. 61 and 62. However, ref. 61 used thermal evaporation and ref. 62's CBD-grown films were not flake-free and fully covering.
 Fig. 13  Plot of optical bandgaps and AVT of the optimum Cd1−xZnxS films that are heterogeneously grown (with x = 0, 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8) at the right pH level. With Zn incorporation, Eg increases gradually from 2.46 eV (CdS) to 2.77 eV (for Cd0.5Zn0.5S) and then to 3.77 eV in the Cd0.2Zn0.8S film. Also, AVT increases significantly from 51% (for CdS) to 85% (for Cd0.2Zn0.8S). 
A significant improvement in AVT is obtained when Zn is incorporated. AVT is rapidly increased from 51% (CdS) to 75% (Cd0.8Zn0.2S) and reaches up to 85% in the Cd0.2Zn0.8S film – a 34% enhancement compared to pristine CdS. The compact morphology, boosted Eg, and high AVT of these films suggest that the chemically grown films are suitable for use in thin-film photovoltaics.

4 Conclusion
In summary, we have uncovered the effect of basicity on the formation mechanism of Cd1−xZnxS films grown using chemical bath deposition and reported compact, pin-hole free, uniform films with low to high Zn contents, 100% coverage ratio, and good reproducibility. The key to forming a uniform, fully covering film is that the pH of the solution is maintained at constant values throughout the deposition process. Low pH has been found to be suitable for a high Zn containing bath, whereas high pH is favorable for a low Zn content. As the film formation mechanism changes from homogeneous to heterogeneous (when the right pH is set), a clear improvement in film crystallinity and morphology occurs (from porous to compact). This is further substantiated by an improved texture coefficient, stacking fault and dislocation density. The optical properties of the optimum films show a blue shift of the absorption edge and a higher bandgap with a higher Zn content. The bandgap increases from 2.46 eV (for CdS) to 3.77 eV (for Cd0.2Zn0.8S). We propose an empirical relationship between the Zn content and the resulting bandgap of CBD-grown compact Cd1−xZnxS samples, which is yet to be reported in the literature. At the same time, the average visible transmittance improves from 51% to 85% (from CdS to Cd0.2Zn0.8S). The improved properties are expected to improve the energy conversion efficiency of thin-film PV applications where a low-cost, industrially favorable solution method like CBD is desirable. Finding the optimal pH of the solution to manipulate the formation techniques for any Zn content and understanding the combined effects of pH and Zn contents on the structure, morphology and optical properties will provide a detailed guideline for depositing high-quality Cd1−xZnxS films using a low-cost CBD method.

(a) Homogeneous formation and random aggregation of particles/clusters in the Cd0.8Zn0.2S film, (b) continuous morphology with some flakes in the Cd0.5Zn0.5S film and (c) heterogeneous formation dominated fully covering, compact high Zn containing Cd0.2Zn0.8S film; (d) uniform Cd0.8Zn0.2S film with flakes, (e) heterogeneous formation dominated fully covering, compact moderate Zn containing Cd0.5Zn0.5S film and (f) slow release of metal ions/insufficient adsorption of dihydroxo–metal and dihydroxo-diamino–metal complexes from relatively stable metal–amino complexes results in poor coverage of the Cd0.2Zn0.8S film; (g) highly dense, compact low Zn–Cd0.8Zn0.2S film, (h) slow release of metal ions/insufficient adsorption of dihydroxo–metal and/or dihydroxo-diamino–metal complexes from relatively stable metal–amino complexes in a high pH bath results in incomplete coverage of the Cd0.5Zn0.5S film and (i) coverage issue becomes more severe in high Zn containing Cd0.2Zn0.8S film. (c), (e) and (g) show the desired morphology of a buffer layer in PVs. High pH for low Zn and low pH for high Zn is optimum.	 

 	Fig. 3  Coverage of the substrate surface with Cd1−xZnxS films deposited at different pH levels. In general, coverage deteriorates with high pH values; however, the onset of the reduction in coverage depends on the Zn content. Higher Zn content shows a more rapid decrease in coverage with pH. Cd0.8Zn0.2S films cover the whole substrate at any pH. Cd0.5Zn0.5S films deposited at pH – 10.5 do not completely cover the substrate. Very low coverage is noticed for high Zn content films at high pH.	 

 	Fig. 4  Average particle size of deposited samples with corresponding standard deviation. In all samples, the average particle size increases with the increasing pH of the solution. Slow release of metal ions may favor the coalescence of particles to be enlarged.	 

 	Fig. 5  Typical EDS spectra of fully covering (a) Cd0.8Zn0.2S, (b) Cd0.5Zn0.5S and (c) Cd0.2Zn0.8S films deposited at pH – 10.5, 10 and 9.5, respectively. Zn content is gradually increased with increasing Zn amount in the starting precursor solution.

At all pH values, the intensity of peaks declines with increasing Zn content. A relatively broad peak base is observed for Cd0.2Zn0.8S pH – 10, Cd0.5Zn0.5S pH – 10.5 and Cd0.2Zn0.8S pH – 10.5 films, which have low coverage as shown in Fig. 2.

 	Fig. 8  Relationship among structural parameters of heterogeneously grown optimum Cd1−xZnxS films. The texture coefficient along the (002) plane decreases with increasing Zn content, resulting in increased stacking fault, dislocation density and lattice strain. Consequently, a gradual decrease in crystallite size is observed with the incorporation of Zn.	 

 	Fig. 9  Unit cell volume contracts with Zn incorporation in heterogeneously grown Cd1−xZnxS films at different pH values. Zn atom% of the films increases with increasing Zn content of the bath.	 

 	Fig. 10  Transmittance spectra of the CBD grown films with corresponding coverage area percentage in the parenthesis (a–c). Films with identical morphology show similar transmittance patterns regardless of pH and Zn content of the solutions. Heterogeneously grown films show steep absorption edges, indicating the uniformity and compactness of the films. Homogeneously grown porous samples show poor transmittance due to the higher absorption caused by their porous microstructure. A similar transmission pattern is observed in flake structures. (d) Photopic response of the human eye with heterogeneously grown optimum film transmittance spectra. The spectrum of CdS is taken from our previous work.26 Calculated AVTs are mentioned in the parenthesis. AVT significantly increases from 51% to 85% with increasing Zn content.

 	Fig. 11  Absorption coefficient as a function of wavelength. The optical loss decreases with the increase in wavelength and the transition in absorption loss is related to the optical bandgap of the films. The absorption edge shifts to a shorter wavelength with increasing Zn content.

 	Fig. 12  (a–f) Tauc plots of the fully covering Cd1−xZnxS films deposited at different pH levels (mentioned in the parenthesis). With increasing pH, heterogeneous formation dominates over homogeneous one and the bandgap, Eg, of Cd0.8Zn0.2S and Cd0.5Zn0.5S increases. In heterogeneously grown optimum films, Eg significantly increases from 2.55 eV to 3.77 eV with increasing Zn content.

 	Fig. 13  Plot of optical bandgaps and AVT of the optimum Cd1−xZnxS films that are heterogeneously grown (with x = 0, 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8) at the right pH level. With Zn incorporation, Eg increases gradually from 2.46 eV (CdS) to 2.77 eV (for Cd0.5Zn0.5S) and then to 3.77 eV in the Cd0.2Zn0.8S film. Also, AVT increases significantly from 51% (for CdS) to 85% (for Cd0.2Zn0.8S).
