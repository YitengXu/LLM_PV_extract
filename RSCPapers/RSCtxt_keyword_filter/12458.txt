E-mail: ajen@u.washington.eduReceived 14th August 2013, Accepted 18th September 2013First published on 19th September 2013AbstractA series of two-dimensional diketopyrrolopyrrole-based low band gap conjugated polymers were synthesized. Replacing thiophene with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene in the side chain and bridge resulted in significant changes to the optical, electrochemical, and morphological properties of the polymers, as well as the subsequent performance of devices made from these materials. The polymer with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene as a bridge instead of a side chain exhibited an increased absorption coefficient and hole mobility, and resulted in the highest power conversion efficiency (5.34%) in this series of polymers. This finding provides valuable insight for the development of more efficient low band-gap polymers.IntroductionHarvesting energy directly from sunlight using photovoltaic (PV) technology has become an essential component of future global energy production. The driving forces for the search for new environmentally friendly and renewable energy sources are the decreased availability of fossil fuel sources, the detrimental effect of emission of CO2 and other greenhouse gases generated from fossil fuels into the atmosphere, and increasing worldwide sensitivity toward energy security and price stability. Conjugated polymeric materials have been continuously relevant in the scientific community over the last two decades due to their unexpected electro-optical properties. Recent progress in the development of p-type conjugated polymers and device technologies has led to synchronous advances in polymer solar cells (PSCs) with higher device performance. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single junction PSCs has reached more than 9% very recently.1 Development of materials for high efficiency PSCs, however, still challenges the ability of materials chemists to translate a number of required characteristics (e.g., high absorption coefficient, high hole (or electron) mobility and high exciton diffusion length, high stability and durability and others) into specific molecular design and synthetic sequences.2–8 Most polymers which can be applied in PSCs show a high absorption coefficient in the visible range below 700 nm. Few materials demonstrate good absorption in the red or near infrared region, which is the major component of the solar spectrum. Thus the development of low bandgap materials which can absorb longer wavelength light will be desirable for high efficiency PSCs with reduced energy loss and increased photocurrent density.9–12The use of the donor (D)–acceptor (A) approach is a highly attractive way to develop low bandgap polymers, in which the hybridization of the energy levels of the donor and acceptor moieties result in D–A systems with unusually low HOMO–LUMO separation. Among various low bandgap materials developed for bulk heterojunction (BHJ) devices, the diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based conjugated polymers are particularly interesting due to their superior optical and electrical properties.13–20 The electron-deficient nature of DPP has been exploited for the synthesis of extremely narrow bandgap D–A materials that very well match with the solar spectrum. Moreover, the planarity of the DPP skeleton and its ability to accept hydrogen bonds result in copolymers that encourage π–π stacking. On the other hand, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′] dithiophene (BDT) units have also been flourishing as electron donor units in past few years.21–28 As a result of its symmetric and planar conjugated structure, it can easily facilitate π-electron delocalization within the polymer chain and improves π–π interactions between polymer chains in the solid state.29–31 The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of BDT-based conjugated polymers can be fine-tuned by using different substituents on the central phenyl rings. For instance, replacement of the alkoxy groups with conjugated thienyl side chains can enhance the coplanarity of the polymer and consequently leads to a broader absorption, higher charge mobilities and a deeper HOMO, thereby resulting in improved solar cell performance.32,33Thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) units have recently been widely utilized to extend the effective conjugation length of a polymer, leading to improved charge mobility and performance of the subsequent devices.34–36 In this contribution, we designed and synthesized a series of new BDT and DPP-based conjugated polymers with TT units both in the side-chain and spacer of DPP respectively, for studying the effect of the position of the TT unit in the polymer backbones on the optical, electrochemical, and morphological properties of the polymers. Zhang et al.,37 recently investigated the influence of the extended conjugation on the photovoltaic properties of DPP based polymers. However, some very important parameters which strongly affect the device performance, such as absorption coefficient and planarity of the polymers, were not studied in their work. To systematically study the underlying mechanism behind this, we have conducted a thorough device, spectroscopic and theoretical analysis to correlate the polymer structure with the device performance.Results and discussionThe polymers were synthesized via a microwave-assisted Stille polymerization with a palladium catalyst, which has been demonstrated to produce polymers with high molecular weights;38 the chemical structure of these three polymers is shown in Scheme 1. The details of the synthesis can be found in the ESI.† All of the polymers exhibited very good solubility in common organic solvents, such as dichloromethane (DCM), chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB) and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), giving these polymers good processability for device fabrication. The number-average molecular weights of PBDT-DPP, PBDTTT-DPP and PBDT-TTDPP were 35.2 kDa, 47.8 kDa and 23.2 kDa, respectively, with polydispersity indices (PDI) of 2.18, 2.50 and 1.77. Scheme 1  Chemical structures of PBDT-DPP, PBDTTT-DPP and PBDT-TTDPP. The optical absorption of the polymers was investigated in chloroform solutions and in thin films. The summarized data are listed in Table 1. All the polymers show the same two characteristic peaks resulting from their similar polymer main chains (Fig. 1a). The longer wavelength band is due to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between BDT and DPP units, and the other band at shorter wavelengths is attributed to localized π–π* transitions. It was interesting to note that the absorption coefficients of PBDT-TTDPP in both solution and thin films are significantly higher than those of PBDT-DPP and PBDTTT-DPP, as shown in Fig. 1a and b. Since the absorption coefficient of a D–A conjugated polymer is dependent on the orbital overlap between the HOMO and LUMO wave functions,39 quantum-chemical calculations were conducted to provide detailed information about the oscillator strength of these polymers. The calculated oscillator strengths are shown in Fig. 1c. The higher oscillator strength calculated for PBDT-TTDPP confirms the experimentally observed higher absorption coefficient. Meanwhile, all of these polymers exhibited enhanced ICT peaks and showed significant red-shift in the solid state compared to those measured in solution, which indicated a more ordered structure in the solid state due to stronger inter-chain packing. The corresponding optical bandgaps of PBDT-DPP, PBDTTT-DPP and PBDT-TTDPP were estimated to be 1.43, 1.43 and 1.47 eV by extrapolating from the absorption edge of these films.

To further understand the geometric and electrical properties of these polymers, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G (d) level by modeling the dimer of the polymers' repeating units. The HOMO and LUMO wave functions of the compounds are shown in Fig. 2. For these three oligomers, the HOMO wave functions are well delocalized along the donor and acceptor units while their LUMO wave functions are more localized at the acceptor parts. Notably, a more extended delocalization of the HOMO was observed for PBDT-TTDPP compared to PBDT-DPP and PBDTTT-DPP. This increased orbital overlap between the HOMO and LUMO of the PBDT-TTDPP system contributes to the enhanced absorption coefficient. However, when the TT unit was located at the side chain, an increased orbital overlap between the HOMO and LUMO levels can hardly be observed. This is because the large twist angle between the TT side chain and the BDT backbone inhibits electron delocalization. Meanwhile, the optimized geometries of all these oligomers were investigated. Fig. 2 shows that all of these polymers show quite planar conformations with quite small torsion angles, which will facilitate the electron/hole transport along the backbone. Fig. 2  DFT-calculated HOMO and LUMO wave functions of the geometry optimized structures (B3LYP/6-31G*) of the analog dimer model of the studied polymers, and planar geometries of the PBDT-DPP, PBDTTT-DPP and PBDT-TTDPP dimers (side view). The electrochemical properties of all polymers were investigated by cyclic voltammetry. As shown in Fig. 3, the potentials were measured against Ag/Ag+ as the reference electrode, with a platinum counter electrode in a 0.1 M electrolyte containing tetrabutyl-ammonium hexafluorophosphate in acetonitrile with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The HOMO/LUMO values of PBDT-DPP, PBDTTT-DPP and PBDT-TTDPP were calculated from the onset of the redox potentials taking the known reference level for ferrocene, 4.8 eV below the vacuum level, according to the equations as follows:40,41HOMO = −[Eonset − Eox(ferrocene)] − 4.8 eVLOMO = −[Eonset − Ered(ferrocene)] − 4.8 eV Fig. 3  Cyclic voltammograms for the sample films coated onto a platinum plate in an acetonitrile solution of 0.1 M [Bu4N]PF6 at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The calculated HOMO values for PBDT-DPP, PBDTTT-DPP and PBDT-TTDPP are −5.21, −5.15 and −5.06 eV, respectively. The HOMO level of PBDT-TTDPP is 0.10 eV higher than that of PBDT-DPP and PBDTTT-DPP due to the extended delocalization of electrons along the backbone.Charge carrier mobility of the active materials for polymer solar cells is one of the most important factors dictating device performance, as it is directly related to exciton dissociation, charge transport, and recombination. To probe how the thiono[3,2-b]thiophene units influence the charge transport of the polymers, the mobility of the polymers was measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method using hole-only devices with structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag at the optimized blend ratio of polymer:PC71BM. The single-carrier mobility can be extracted from the dark J–V characteristics of the hole-only devices by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) model:  where ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the relative permittivity of the material, μ is the charge carrier mobility, γ is the field activation factor, and L is the thickness of the active layer. As shown in Fig. 4, the hole mobilities (μSCLC,h) of PBDT-DPP, PBDTTT-DPP and PBDT-TTDPP are (1.1 ± 0.4) × 10−4, (2.4 ± 0.3) × 10−4 and (5.3 ± 0.3) × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The mobility of the polymers was obtained by taking the average behaviour of at least five devices. These findings imply that among these three polymers, although PBDT-TTDPP has the lowest molecular weight (23.2 kDa), it still exhibits the highest hole mobility. This enhancement in hole mobility can be ascribed to the increased orbital overlap and decreased torsion angles of PBDT-TTDPP. High values of Jsc and FF can thus be expected in the PBDT-TTDPP-based solar cell due to the balanced charge carrier transport in the active layer. Fig. 4  Current density and voltage (J–V) curves of the hole-only devices containing the polymer and PC71BM. Photovoltaic properties of these polymers were investigated initially with a BHJ device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Bis-C60/Ag under illumination of AM 1.5G at 100 mA cm−2. Typical J–V curves of the devices are shown in Fig. 5a, and the performance of these devices is summarized in Table 2.

Indeed, the PBDT-TTDPP device shows a much improved PCE of 5.34% with a Voc of 0.73 V, a Jsc of 14.58 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.50, while the devices based on PBDT-DPP and PBDTTT-DPP exhibited lower PCEs of 4.0% and 4.4%, with significantly decreased Jsc of 11.27 and 12.18 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.50 and 0.47, respectively. The increased Jsc and FF are apparently the result of the enhanced light-harvesting ability and charge mobility of PBDT-TTDPP. Meanwhile, the differences in Voc could be due to differences in the polymers' electronic properties. It is well known that the Voc of a PSC is proportional to the difference between the HOMO level of the polymer and the LUMO level of PC71BM. Elevating the HOMO level results in a lower Voc.34,42–44 The increased π-electron delocalization along the backbone results in a higher HOMO level of PBDT-TTDPP. Therefore, the Voc of PBDT-TTDPP was decreased. To verify the improved Jsc, the external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of the polymer/PC71BM devices were measured and are shown in Fig. 5b. The Jsc values calculated from the EQE curves under standard AM 1.5G conditions match well with those obtained from the J–V measurements. It should be noted that the PBDT-TTDPP blend with PC71BM exhibited a slightly higher intensity than the blends of PBDT-DPP/PC71BM and PBDTTT-DPP/PC71BM, which is in agreement with the absorption of the polymer films. The enhanced light absorption coincides well with the increased EQE, indicating its contribution to the increased Jsc.Optimal phase segregation and formation of a bicontinuous interpenetrating network between the polymer donor and the PCBM acceptor are critical to achieving high device performance, and greatly influence the charge separation and exciton dissociation.45 To gain a deeper insight into the nature of the morphology of the active layer, tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed. As shown in Fig. 6, large domains on the surface of the films based on PBDT-DPP:PC71BM and PBDTTT-DPP:PC71BM can be observed. This increases exciton recombination, as the phase domains are substantially larger than the exciton diffusion length, making excitons less likely to reach the donor–acceptor interface, inhibiting the formation of free charge carriers and thus limiting the Jsc and FF of the resulting devices. There are several ways to alter the interpenetrating nanoscale morphology of a BHJ cell. Recently, the co-solvent process has been proved to be an efficient way to improve the morphology. The co-solvent system plays the role of slowing the aggregation of the conjugated polymer and PCBM so as to avoid the formation of oversized polymer or PCBM aggregates which inhibit charge carrier transport in the BHJ film.46 Chloroform (CF) and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) were mostly used as co-solvents. Due to the low boiling point of chloroform resulting in the rapid drying of the films, the morphology of the films using pure CF is always poor. So, incorporating some amount of a high boiling point solvent such as o-dichlorobenzene as a co-solvent can significantly improve the film morphology. The slow drying of the solvent allows sufficient time for the self-organization of the active layer.47 To take advantage of this effect, co-solvents chloroform and o-dichlorobenzene were used to improve the morphology of the polymer blends, especially for PBDT-DPP:PC71BM and PBDTTT-DPP:PC71BM. The morphology of the polymer:PC71BM films cast from CF and o-DCB solution was studied by AFM (as shown in Fig. 6). The previously observed large size domains in the PBDT-DPP:PC71BM and PBDTTT-DPP:PC71BM thin films cast from o-DCB solutions (Fig. 6a and b) can no longer be detected. This indicates that co-solvent processing can promote the self-aggregation of polymers in a relatively fluid medium and also improves the compatibility between the polymer and PC71BM. To verify this point, solar cell devices with the same device configuration as described above were fabricated by spin-coating the films from CF and CF/o-DCB co-solvent. The J–V curves of these devices are shown in Fig. S1† and summarized in Table S1.† The PCE of the devices increased from 0.24% to 4.47%; this significant enhancement of the PCE could be due to the morphological changes induced by using co-solvent processing.

In summary, we have successfully designed and synthesized a new two-dimensional polymer PBDTTT-DPP. For comparison purposes, the polymers PBDT-DPP and PBDT-TTDPP were also synthesized and well-characterized. The replacement of thiophene with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene in the side chains resulted in red-shifted absorption, a lower HOMO energy level and an enhanced solar cell performance. The increased orbital overlap between the HOMO and LUMO levels of the PBDT-TTDPP system contributes to the enhanced absorption coefficient. The photovoltaic properties of these polymers were investigated using the device configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Bis-C60/Ag. The highest achievable PCEs for PBDT-DPP, PBDTTT-DPP, and PBDT-TTDPP were 4.06%, 4.47%, and 5.34%, respectively. It is worth noting that the quality of the blend films plays an important role in exciton separation and diffusion. The morphology of these films was improved significantly by using co-solvent processing, which lead to a remarkable increase in the PCE of these devices. Our findings provide significant insight for the development of new generation low bandgap material design.ExperimentalsMaterialsAll chemicals, unless otherwise specified, were purchased from Aldrich and used as received. 2-Ethylhexylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene,48 3,6-bis(5-bromo-2-thienyl)-2,5-dihydro-2,5-di(2-hexyldecyl)-pyrrolo[3,4c]-pyrrolo-1,4-dione,49 3,6-bis(2-bromothieno-[3,2-b]thiophen-5-yl)-2,5-dihydro-2,5-di-(2-hexyldecyl)-pyrrolo[3,4c]-pyrrolo-1,4-dione12 and 4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)-thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene50 were synthesized according to the reported procedures.Synthesis of compound BDT-TTIn a dried three-neck 50 mL argon purged flask, n-BuLi (2.5 M, 2.63 mmol) was added drop-wise to a mixture of 2-ethylhexylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene (440 mg, 1.75 mmol) in THF (20 mL) at 0 °C. The mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 2 h and then warmed to 50 °C and stirred for 30 min. Afterwards 4,8-dehydrobenzo[l,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (128 mg, 0.58 mmol) was quickly added to the reaction mixture, which was then stirred for 1 h at 50 °C. After cooling the reaction mixture to ambient temperature, SnCl2 (0.88 g, 4.46 mmol) in 10 mL HCl (10%) was added and the mixture was stirred for an additional 2 h, after which it was subsequently poured into ice water and extracted with diethyl ether twice. The combined extracts were dried with anhydrous Na2SO4 and evaporated. The crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel to give the pure compound as a pale yellow solid (0.20 g, yield 50%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, d-CDCl3, ppm): 7.70 (d, J = 3.4 Hz, 2H), 7.57 (s, 2H), 7.49 (d, J = 3.4 Hz, 2H), 7.03 (s, 2H), 2.90 (m, 4H), 1.70 (m, 2H), 1.36 (m, 16H), 0.95 (m, 12H). 13C NMR (125 MHz, d-CDCl3, ppm): 147.8, 139.5, 139.4, 139.3, 137.6, 136.8, 127.9, 124.3, 123.4, 120.4, 117.4, 41.5, 35.3, 32.4, 29.0, 25.5, 23.1, 14.2, 10.9.

The solution was cooled to −78 °C, and a solution of n-BuLi (2.5 M, 0.87 mmol) was added drop-wise with stirring. The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h at −78 °C and then warmed to room temperature and stirred for 1 h. Then the reaction mixture was cooled to −78 °C and a Me3SnCl solution (1.0 M, 1.2 mmol) was added in one portion. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was quenched by addition of distilled water, then the mixture was extracted with diethyl ether and the combined organic phase was concentrated to obtain a yellow solid crude product (0.24 g, 83%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, d-CDCl3, ppm): 7.73 (s, 2H), 7.59 (s, 2H), 7.04 (s, 2H), 2.90 (m, 4H), 1.70 (m, 2H), 1.36 (m, 16H), 0.95 (m, 12H), 0.39 (m, 18H). 13C NMR (125 MHz, d-CDCl3, ppm): 147.6, 143.9, 143.2, 140.3, 139.5, 137.7, 131.1, 122.7, 120.5, 120.4, 117.5, 41.6, 35.4, 32.6, 29.1, 25.6, 23.2, 14.4, 11.0, −8.1.General method of microwave-assisted polymerization by Stille couplingA 10 mL microwave tube was charged with BDT-di-tin monomer (0.5 mmol) and DPP (0.48 mmol) in a mixture of o-xylene (2 mL) and DMF (0.2 mL). After being purged with argon for 30 min, Pd2(dba)3 (0.024 mmol) and P(o-tol)3 (0.087 mmol) were added to the tube. Then, the resulting mixture was heated in a microwave reactor at 120 °C for 5 min, 150 °C for 5 min, and 170 °C for 40 min. After cooling to room temperature, the resulting mixture was precipitated by adding to methanol (50 mL) and filtered. The collected precipitate was subjected to Soxhlet extraction with methanol, hexane, and chloroform. The high molecular weight part was collected and dried under vacuum. The yield and results of the polymers are as follows:PBDT-DPP. 1H NMR (300 MHz, d-CDCl3, ppm): 9.15 (br, 2H), 7.57–7.32 (br, 4H), 7.03 (br, 4H), 4.29 (br, 4H), 3.00 (br, 4H), 1.88 (br, 4H), 1.48–1.05 (br, 60H), 0.87 (br, 24H).

Molecular weight: Mn = 23.2 kDa, Mw = 41.1 kDa, PDI = 1.77. Yield: 67%.General characterization methodsUV-vis spectra were measured using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda-9 spectrophotometer. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were collected on a Bruker AV 300 and 500 spectrometer operating at 300 and 125 MHz in deuterated chloroform solution with TMS as a reference, respectively. Mass spectrometry (MS) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Esquire LC-Ion Trap. Molecular weights were measured using a Waters 1515 gel permeation chromatograph with a refractive index detector at room temperature (against polystyrene standards in THF). Cyclic voltammetry of the polymer films was conducted in acetonitrile with 0.1 M of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate using a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. ITO, Ag/AgCl and Pt mesh were used as the working electrode, reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. AFM images under tapping mode were taken on a Veeco multimode AFM with a Nanoscope III controller. The molar extinction coefficient was obtained from polymer solutions with same concentration (0.5 mg mL−1), and the thickness of the films was measured by AFM.Device fabricationITO-coated glass substrates (15 Ω sq−1) were cleaned with detergent, de-ionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol. A thin layer (ca. 35 nm) of PEDOT:PSS (Baytron® P VP AI 4083, filtered at 0.45 μm) was first spin-coated on the pre-cleaned ITO-coated glass substrates at 5000 rpm and baked at 140 °C for 10 min under ambient conditions. The substrates were then transferred to an argon-filled glove-box. Subsequently, the polymer:PC71BM active layer (ca. 90 nm) was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer at 600 rpm from a homogeneously blended solution. The solution was prepared by dissolving the polymer and fullerene at a weight ratio of 1:2 in a co-solvent of chloroform and o-dichlorobenzene to a total concentration of 12 mg mL−1 at 110 °C overnight, and filtered through a PTFE filter (0.45 μm). All of the substrates were placed on a hot plate at 110 °C for 10 min. After annealing, the substrates were briefly transferred out of the glove box (total ambient exposure < 10 min), and a 10 nm thick film of C60-bis surfactant51,52 (1 mg mL−1 in methanol) was spin-coated at 5000 rpm. The substrates were then transferred back to the glove box and annealed at 110 °C for 5 min to drive off any remaining solvent prior to metal deposition. At the final stage, the substrates were pumped down to high vacuum (<2 × 10−6 Torr), and silver (100 nm) was thermally evaporated onto the active layer. Shadow masks were used to define the active area (10.08 × 10−2 cm2) of the devices.Device characterizationThe current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the unencapsulated photovoltaic devices were measured under ambient conditions using a Keithley 2400 source-measurement unit. An Oriel xenon lamp (450 Watt) with an AM1.5G filter was used as the solar simulator. The light intensity was set to 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) using a calibrated Hamamatsu silicon diode with a KG5 color filter, which can be traced to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The EQE system used a lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research Systems SR830) to record the short-circuit current under chopped monochromatic light.AcknowledgementsThe authors are grateful for the financial support of the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities and the Shanghai Leading Talents program.ReferencesZ.
