    , Accepted 15th February 2019First published on 18th February 2019AbstractBy direct carbonization of ZIF-8 nanopowder under an inert atmosphere, ZnO-nitrogen doped carbon (ZnO-NC) materials have been prepared and added at different content values to polystyrenesulfonate-doped poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT:PSS) and employed as an efficient catalyst in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The electrochemical analysis confirms that the prepared counter electrodes display catalytic activity higher than those of PEDOT:PSS and Pt CEs for I3−/I− and [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox mediators. The photovoltaic conversion efficiency of the assembled DSSC with the 7% ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS catalyst and an I3−/I− based electrolyte is 8.05%. By increasing the thickness of the prepared counter electrode, the electrocatalytic activity is greatly enhanced and the total performance reaches 9.16%, which is 21.16% greater than that of the Pt-based cell (7.56%). Furthermore, ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS CEs are also confirmed to exhibit outstanding catalytic activity toward the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox couple. The resultant conversion efficiency of the assembled DSSC with a 7% ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS CE is 8.12%, which is greater than that of the Pt-based cell (7.49%).
1 Introduction
Due to the shortage of energy facing human beings these days, great efforts all over the world have been devoted to finding suitable clean and cheap energy resources. A lot of attempts have been devoted to making use of solar energy, and one of the promising methods is to convert sunlight to usable electricity using devices known as solar cells. These devices depend mainly on the photoelectric effect.1 The high cost of the traditional silicon solar cells has pushed scientists to find alternative devices available at low cost. One of the most promising alternatives is the Grätzel cell or dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). These cells are simply prepared from available materials with low cost and the obtained conversion efficiency is relatively high. Typically, a DSSC is mainly composed of a mesoporous TiO2 layer loaded with a monolayer dye as a photoanode, an electrolyte solution with a redox couple, and a cathode to gather the obtained photoelectrons and catalyze the reduction of the redox couple. Due to its outstanding catalytic activity and conductivity, Pt is the most widely used CE in DSSCs and in many applications. However, in addition to its high price and rarity, which limit its largescale application, its ability to dissolve in the presence of I3−/I− redox mediators is another key issue related to the lifetime of the assembled DSSCs.2 Although, a lot of materials, including conducting polymers,3,4 metal sulfides,5–9 carbides,10,11 selenides,12–14 metal alloys,15,16 semiconductive-based materials,17 and carbon-based materials,18–23 have been used as outstanding Pt-free CEs in DSSCs, little attention has been paid to metal oxides as counter electrode catalysts in DSSCs. Ma et al. reported that tungsten dioxide (WO2) nanorods and niobium oxides (Nb2O5 and NbO2) as a CE in DSSCs showed excellent catalytic activity toward the reduction of I3−. The conversion efficiencies reached 7.25% and 7.88%, respectively. Both of these are comparable with that of the DSC based on a Pt-based CE.24,25 This reveals that metal oxides may be a promising catalytic material for DSSCs. Among the metal oxides, the semiconductor ZnO has attracted attention as a promising material for many applications, such as bio-sensors,26 photocatalysts,27,28 and lithium-ion batteries,29,30 and is often used as a photoanode in DSSCs.31,32 This is due to its availability with low price, in addition to its good electrocatalytic ability and eco-friendliness. Due to its lower conductivity, it is necessary to combine ZnO with other highly conductive materials for it to act as an efficient CE in DSSC applications. Conductive polymers such as PEDOT:PSS with ZnO have been demonstrated to be effective for enhanced photocatalytic activity. Hu et al. reported that ZnO with PEDOT:PSS as a composite CE in DSSCs exhibits excellent catalytic activity toward the reduction of I3−. The best conversion efficiency was 8.17%.33 Ho et al. mixed different Zn compounds with PEDOT:PSS to be used as Pt-free CEs in DSSCs. The obtained data showed high catalytic activity toward the reduction of I3− with high conversion efficiency. However, the device assembled with a 10% ZnO-PEDOT:PSS CE showed a conversion efficiency of 7.54%, which is still lower than that of a Pt-based device (8.50%).34 Doping carbon-based materials is an effective strategy to enhance the catalytic activity of the transition metal compounds.7,26,35 However, there have been no attempts to use carbon-doped ZnO for the catalytic reduction of the redox couple in DSSC applications. Carbon (C)/nitrogen (N) can be introduced to ZnO via either in situ synthesis or post-treatment methods.36,37 Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), as highly crystalline materials consisting of metal ions joined with an organic ligand, have received remarkable attention as a precursor to prepare porous carbon,38,39 and carbon composites;40 this is due to their high chemical and thermal stability.41 Moreover, their large pore sizes, high surface area, and high porosity play an important role in catalytic and environmental applications. Compared with conventional carbon materials, MOF-derived carbons can be simply prepared, retain the tunnel structure of the MOF, and possess high porosity and large surface area, which can provide a large active area for electrochemical reactions.42–44 Thus, MOF-derived porous carbon and its hybrid materials are often applied as counter electrodes for many applications, such as storage lithium-ion batteries,45 and CEs in DSSCs.46,47 Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (e.g. ZIF-8), a subclass of MOFs, are simply prepared at room-temperature by the co-ordination of metal ions (Zn, Co,…) and imidazolate without thermal or mechanical activation processes.48 The most important feature of ZIFs is the high content of N; moreover, they exhibit exceptionally high thermal and chemical stability.49 The higher catalytic activity of ZIF-8 and nitrogen-doped carbon (NC)-derived ZIF-8 (ref. 50 and 51) is motivation for the preparation of new ZIF-8-derived materials as alternative Pt-free CEs in DSSCs. Herein, ZnO-NC was prepared by one-step pyrolysis and successfully applied as a CE in DSSCs. Its impact as a CE in DSSCs with both I3−/I− and [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox mediators is explored. Owing to the higher catalytic activity of NC and the distribution of ZnO acting as catalytically active centers, the obtained ZnO-NC is expected to boost the total performance of the assembled DSSC. This is the first time that ZnO-NC-derived ZIF-8 has been used as a CE in a DSSC based on I3−/I−, as well as the first time that a ZIF-derived carbon material has been applied as a CE with [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox mediators.
2 Experimental section
2.1 Preparation of ZIF-8-derived ZnO-NC
ZIF-8 nanocrystals were prepared as reported in the literature.49 Typically, 810 mg of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O in 40 mL of methanol was mixed stepwise with 526 mg of 2-methylimidazole. Then, the mixture was kept without stirring for 12 h at room temperature. The resulting white precipitate (ZIF-8) was centrifuged and washed with fresh methanol before drying at 70 °C overnight. The obtained ZIF-8 powders were put in a semi-enclosed porcelain boat and subjected to heat treatment in N2 flow at 5 °C min−1, and the sample was kept at 700 °C for 2 h. After slowly cooling to room temperature, the prepared powder (ZnO-NC) was obtained and subjected to different characterization techniques.
2.2 Counter electrode fabrication
ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS CEs were fabricated by dispersing different portions of ZnO-NC (1, 3, 5, 7 and 10%) in PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution under magnetic stirring for 0.5 h. To each mixture, 6% ethylene glycol (EG) was added, and the mixture was kept under stirring for 2 h. The resulting slurries were coated onto pre-cleaned FTO substrates by spin coating at 2000 rpm for 30 s. The obtained CEs were subjected to drying at 100 °C for 1 h before analysis. For comparison, a PEDOT:PSS CE was prepared using the same technique as used for the ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS CEs, except that pure PEDOT:PSS was used. Moreover, a Pt CE was prepared by hydrothermal treatment of a methanolic solution of 10 mM H2PtCl6 at 380 °C for 0.5 h.52
2.3 Fabrication of the photoanode and DSSCs
The TiO2 photoanode and DSSCs were assembled as described in the literature.51 The details are summarized in the ESI.† Here, two different liquid electrolytes based on I3−/I− and [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ were used. The I3−/I− redox couple consisted of 500 mM LiI, 50 mM I2 and 500 mM 4-tert-butyl pyridine (4TBP). The components of the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox couple are based on a previous report.53 Briefly, the electrolyte solution consists of 200 mM [Co(bpy)3] (TFSI)2, 60 mM [Co(bpy)3] (TFSI)3, 50 mM LiTFSI, and 1000 mM 4-tert-butyl pyridine (4TBP). The details of the preparation of the cobalt complexes are provided in the ESI.†
2.4 Characterization techniques

2.4.1 Material characterization. 
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was used to investigate the structures of the prepared materials. The XRD patterns were recorded at a 5° min−1 scan rate on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer using a Cu K radiation source operated at 40 kV with monochromatized Cu-Kα radiation. The existence of C, N, O, and Zn elements in the prepared samples was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements at a base pressure of <10−9 Torr on a VG Multi-Lab 2000 spectrometer. The surface area and pore size distribution were investigated by the N2 gas adsorption/desorption technique on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 HD88 system. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) model was used to determine the surface area and the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model was applied to define the pore size distribution. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted under air flow with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1, using an NETZSCH STA 449C instrument. A Veeco Dektak profilometer was employed to determine the thickness of the catalytic layers. The morphology was analyzed by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FS-SEM) using a JSM 7100F FESEM (Zeiss Ultra Plus) equipped with an energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) analyzer; the analysis was performed at 20 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained by a JEM-2100F field emission microscope (JEOL Ltd., Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.


2.4.2 Electrochemical analysis. 
Electrochemical study of the as prepared CEs was performed by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel polarization analysis to evaluate their electrocatalytic activity. Here, CV analysis was performed using a conventional three-electrode cell on a CHI760D electrochemical workstation. In this system, Ag/Ag+ was used as a reference electrode, platinum as a counter electrode and the different prepared electrodes used as the working electrodes. These electrodes are immersed in nitrogen-pebbled anhydrous acetonitrile solution of (i) 5 mM LiI and 0.5 mM I2 electrolyte for the iodine-based electrolyte and (ii) 50 mM [Co (bpy)3] (TFSI)2 and 50 mM [Co (bpy)3] (TFSI)3 for the cobalt system. For both systems, LiTFSI (100 mM) was used as the supporting electrolyte and a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 was applied. The EIS studies were done for symmetric cells (CE/electrolyte/CE) under dark conditions and a 10 mV AC amplitude. EIS analysis was carried out on an Ametek 1260 EIS instrument equipped with a frequency response analyzer and the obtained spectra were investigated using Z-view software and fitted by using an equivalent electric circuit. Tafel plots were recorded by using the same workstation at a 10 mV s−1 scan rate. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the assembled DSSCs with 0.16 cm2 active areas were recorded under standard irradiation conditions (AM 1.5G, 1000 W m−2 light radiation intensity). A standard Si solar cell was used to adjust the light intensity. A Newport solar simulator, USA (450 W Xe source) with a Keithley 2400 source meter was employed in this study.

3 Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of the prepared ZnO-NC
In this work, solid ZIF-8 was converted to ZnO-NC via direct pyrolysis of ZIF-8 at 700 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere. The simple mechanism is described in Scheme 1 (ESI†). During the pyrolysis process, the organic species gradually decomposed and converted to nitrogen doped carbon (N-C) and ZnO. The presence of ZnO was attributed to the lower temperature used (700 °C), which allowed ZnO to be incorporated inside the porous carbon as observed in previous measurements.54 From Fig. 1a, it can be observed that the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns corresponding to ZIF-8 match well with that of pure ZIF-8 and are in line with previous reports.50 After pyrolysis, these diffraction patterns of the obtained ZnO-NC composite are properly indexed to hexagonal wurtzite ZnO (JCPDS 36-1451), and are in good agreement with those previously reported.28,40

The content of ZnO in the ZnO-NC composite was obtained from TGA. Fig. S2† shows the recorded TGA thermal curve of the ZnO-NC composite. The weight loss before 125 °C can be mainly attributed to water loss. The second weight loss step in the range of 120–670 °C is mostly due to the burning of N-doped carbon and the remnants after 670 °C can be attributed to ZnO. Based on TGA, the weight percentages of ZnO and N-doped C are about 13.01 and 86.99 wt%, respectively. To investigate the porous nature of the as-prepared materials, N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were obtained, and from the obtained data in Fig. 1b it can be noted that ZIF-8 displays a type-I isotherm, indicating a micropore sorption behavior. However, the ZnO-NC derived ZIF-8 possesses a type-IV isotherm curve with a rapid rise in the low P/P0 region and a hysteresis loop in the high P/P0 region. The rapid rise at low relative pressure can be attributed to the adsorption of N2 in micropores, and the presence of the hysteresis loop at high pressure indicates the existence of mesopores in the obtained ZnO-NC.55 From the obtained parameters, it can be concluded that, although the BET surface area of ZnO-NC is 176.45 m2 g−1, which is much lower than that of ZIF-8 (1592.27 m2 g−1), this is mainly contributed by micropores. The average pore size of mesoporous ZnO-NC is 7.5 nm, which is higher than the value of ZIF-8 (5.7 nm) as shown in Fig. 1c. The larger pore size is advantageous to facilitate mass transfer of electrolyte species. The Raman spectra of ZIF-8, NC and ZnO-NC were also collected, and are shown in Fig. S3.† It can be found that ZnO-NC exhibits two characteristic peaks of carbon at ∼1345 and ∼1580 cm−1 for the D and G bands, respectively. The D band of carbonaceous materials reveals the breathing mode of aromatic rings with dangling bonds, while the G band corresponds to the bond stretching of sp2 carbon pairs.56 Moreover, small bands at ∼430 and ∼580 cm−1 for the E2 (high) mode of the hexagonal wurtzite phase, and the E1 (LO) mode for ZnO were also observed.29 The D and G band intensity ratio (ID/IG) is an indispensable parameter used to assess the degree of defects in carbon. The ID/IG ratio for ZnO-NC was calculated to be 0.93, which is lower than that of ZIF-8 nitrogen-doped carbon (1.03) owing to ZnO catalyzing the induction of the graphitization and sp2 hybridization of carbon.57 The morphology of ZnO-NC was examined by TEM, as shown in Fig. 1d, the ZnO-NC particles present a rhombic dodecahedral shape and are approximately 37 nm in size. The HR-TEM (Fig. 1e) shows that the d-spacing is 0.26 nm, which matches well with the d-spacing of the (0 0 2) crystal plane of hexagonal wurtzite ZnO. Also, it can be noticed that ZnO is surrounded by amorphous carbon.
The elemental composition of the ZnO-NC has been investigated by EDS elemental mapping. As shown in Fig. 1f, it can be observed that the ZnO-NC possesses all four elements (C, N, O, and Zn).
Furthermore, XPS was employed to elucidate the elemental composition and chemical states of the ZnO-NC nanoparticles. The XPS survey spectrum of the ZnO-NC nanoparticles in Fig. S4† shows the presence of C, N, O, and Zn elements, consistent with the elemental mapping results. In Fig. 2a, the O 1s spectrum of ZnO was fitted into two peaks. The peak at 531.8 eV can attributed to the chemisorbed or dissociated oxygen or OH species of the adsorbed H2O on ZnO. The lower binding energy peak (530.8 eV) is for O2− ions of Zn–O bonds in a wurtzite structure with Zn2+ in hexagonal coordination.28 The fitted C 1s spectrum is displayed in Fig. 2b. The peak centered at 284.6 eV represents C–C/CC groups of graphite.58 The weak peaks at 285.7 and 286.9 eV are assigned to C–N and C–O species, respectively.42 In Fig. 2c, the N 1s spectrum exposes three subpeaks at 398.1, 398.8 and 400.0 eV for pyridinic, pyrrolic and graphitic nitrogen species, respectively. Moreover, the pyridinic-N has a higher percentage of nitrogen, and plays an import role in enhancing the electron transfer, hence enhancing the catalytic reduction of I3−; this is due to the presence of a lone pair of electrons.50 The Zn 2p spectrum in Fig. 2d shows two peaks located at 1021.6 and 1044.7 eV, assigned to Zn 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, respectively. Both of these peaks are lower by 0.7 eV than those of pure ZnO.59 Usually a shift to lower energy reveals an increase in electron density, which can be attributed to the carbon coating the surface of the ZnO nanoparticles.40 Moreover, the distance between the two peaks (23.1 eV) indicates the presence of Zn2+ ions in the ZnO-NC.26

3.2 Morphology of the prepared CEs
From the SEM images of the different CEs in Fig. 3, it can be observed that, although the Pt film (Fig. 3b) exhibits a uniform smooth surface, the PEDOT:PSS film in Fig. 3c displays a condensed layer, which is unfavorable for catalytic studies. The prepared 7% ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS film (Fig. 3d) displays a porous surface, which is desirable for offering a higher surface area for reduction reactions. The average pore size of the prepared CE is 35 ± 7.64 nm.

3.3 Electrochemical characterization of the prepared CEs
The prepared CEs were subjected to evaluation of their catalytic activity toward the reduction of I3−/I− and [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox mediators.

3.3.1 Investigation of the prepared CEs in iodine-based electrolyte. 
From Fig. 4a, all CV curves of the various CEs reveal two pairs of redox peaks for the I3−/I− redox couple. These redox peaks can be represented by these equations.60 I3− + 2e− ↔ 3I−(1) 3I2 + 2e− ↔ 2I3−(2)
 Fig. 4  (a) CV curves of various CEs at 50 mV s−1, (b) the corresponding Nyquist plots, (c) Tafel polarization curves, and (d) J–V curves of the DSSCs with the ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS CE and I3−/I− redox couple. 

Eqn (1) is for the more negative peaks and eqn (2) is for the more positive ones. Usually, the reaction in eqn (2) describes the catalytic reduction of I3− in the CE; thus, we will only focus on this reaction. As shown in Fig. 4a and the related data in Table 1, the peak current density (Jpc) is greatly enhanced from 1.06 mA cm−2 to −2.10 mA cm−2 on increasing the content of ZnO-NC from 1% to 7%, respectively. This increase reveals boosting of the catalytic reduction of I2 to I3− ions and increases the reduction of I3− ions to I− ions in the redox couple at the surface of the counter electrode.61 Upon increasing the content of ZnO-NC to 10% ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS CE, the Jpc greatly declined to −1.33 mA cm−2; this can be mainly attributed to lower adhesion of the catalytic layer to the FTO, which results in damage to the electrode during analysis. Therefore, 7% ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS is selected as the optimum composite CE. Moreover, CV analysis for the 7% ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS CE at different scan rates was performed to investigate the nature of the electron transfer reaction between the CEs and the electrolyte. From Fig. S5a,† it can be concluded that the Jpc values increased with increasing scan rate, suggesting that the redox reactions are diffusion-limited for the transport of I− species toward the counter electrode.62 To explore the electrochemical stability of the prepared CEs, the 7% ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS CE was subjected to consecutive CV tests at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. No obvious change in the redox peak current densities was observed after 50 cycles as shown in Fig. S5b,† revealing excellent electrochemical stability.

The electrocatalytic activity of the as-prepared CEs was further investigated by EIS. To eliminate the effect of the photoanode on the catalytic activity, symmetrical cells were made with two identical CEs. Fig. 4b presents the Nyquist plots recorded from the ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS CEs. The obtained EIS spectra were fitted to interpret the measured parameters by using an equivalent circuit, as shown in Fig. 6b. It can be observed that the ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS CEs display three semicircles, which confirms the porous structures of the prepared CEs.63 From the fitted parameters in Table 1, it can be seen that the Rct values gradually decrease from 3.00 Ω to 1.79 Ω on increasing the ZnO-NC content from 1 to 7% in the 1% ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS and 7% ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS CEs, indicating higher electron transfer ability at the CE/electrolyte interface, and a lower interfacial recombination rate, which is preferred to regenerate the excited dye molecules, thus resulting in enhancing the photocurrent density of the DSSC device.64 Moreover, the higher frequency peak in the Bode diagram correlated with Rct at the CE/electrolyte boundary as shown in eqn (3).65 (3)

 Fig. 6  Equivalent circuits of the assembled symmetric cells based on (a) Pt and (b) ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS CEs (Rs is the total resistance (the series resistance), Rct is the charge-transfer resistance, CPE is the constant phase element, ZN represent the Warburg element at low frequency and Zdiff represents the impedance of the diffusion ions of the redox couple through the catalytic layer). 
As shown in Fig. S6,† this peak shifted to a higher frequency representing a reduction in the charge transfer resistance. The lifetime (τ) of electrons in I3− reduction at the CE surface is utilized to evaluate the recombination rate and can be calculated from this relation: τ = 1/2πf.66 From Table 1, all of the τ values of the ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS CEs are smaller than those of PEDOT:PSS (17.87 μs) and Pt CEs (12.65 μs), and the smallest value is 1.21 μs for the 7% ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS CE. This reveals that the ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS CEs can facilitate the flow of electrons for reduction of I3−.
Tafel plots were recorded to further estimate the interfacial electrochemical activities. From Fig. 4c and 5c, the slope of the 7% ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS CE is greater than that of the PEDOT:PSS CE and close to that of the Pt CE, suggesting superior exchange current density (J0),67 which can be attributed to lower charge transfer resistance as expressed in eqn (4).68 (4)where, R the general gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, and F is the Faraday constant.
From the diffusion zone (|V| > 400 mV), the diffusion limited current density (Jlim) can be obtained. Jlim is correlated with the diffusion coefficient of the redox species as described in eqn (5).69 From Table 1, upon adding ZnO-NC, the D is boosted and the 7% ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS electrode reveals the maximum rate (1.63 × 10−5 cm−2 s−1). (5)where D is the diffusion coefficient of I3− species, l is the thickness of the diffusion layer and C is the molar concentration of I3−.
Randles–Sevcik theory is usually used to determine D.70 Jred = Kn1.5ACD0.5v0.5(6)where Jred is the peak current density, K is 2.69 × 105, A is the active area of the electrode (cm2), v is the scan rate for the CV curves (V s−1), n is the number of electrons contributing to the charge transfer and C represents the bulk concentration of redox species (mol cm−3) and D is the diffusion coefficient (cm2 s−1).
Taking the results of CV, EIS and Tafel polarization into consideration, the ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS CEs displayed higher electrocatalytic activity towards the reduction of I3−, making them good candidates for constructing DSSCs. To evaluate their effect on the total performance of DSSCs, a series of DSSC devices were constructed and their total performance was recorded. From Table 2 and Fig. 4d, the conversion efficiency of the DSSCs enhances with increasing content of ZnO-NC, and the overall efficiency (PCE) reaches 8.05% for the device based on the 7% ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS CE, which is superior to that of cells based on the PEDOT:PSS CE (PCE = 4.98%) and close to that of the Pt-based device (PCE = 8.51%) as shown in Fig. 5d. This improvement is mainly attributed to the increase in Jsc as a result of the reduced Rct.8 As mentioned above, a higher ZnO-NC content, as in the 10% ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS CE, results in lower adhesion of the catalytic film to the FTO substrate, which is reflected in an increase in the total resistance (Rs + Rct) and thus a decrease in both Jsc and FF, thus lowering the total performance as shown in Table 1. The smooth surface of the PEDOT:PSS CE results in lower catalytic activity and thus the efficiency of the assembled device is low.

As the total performance of DSSCs can be affected by the thickness of the CE,61 the optimum composite (7% ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS CE) with different thicknesses (3, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 μm) was prepared. Different electrochemical studies were performed; the recorded data are shown in Fig. S7† and the obtained parameters are listed in Table S1.† From CV curves (Fig. S7a†), increasing the thickness of the CE from 3 to 25 μm enlarged the surface area, which in turn enhanced the Jpc from −0.53 to −2.94 mA cm−2. This phenomenon is in line with the assumption that for reversible electrochemical reactions, the peak current is proportional to the electrode surface area.20 Moreover, the higher Jsc reflects a faster reduction reaction of I3− at the surface of the CE.21 Furthermore, the Tafel plots (Fig. S7b†) also showed that increasing the thickness of the catalytic layer results in an improvement in the J0 value, indicating the enhanced charge transferability. The total performance of the DSSCs was also investigated; the recorded J–V curves are in Fig. S7c† and the obtained data are listed in Table S1.† It can be noted that the total performance of the DSSC is drastically enriched to 9.16% for the 7% ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS CE with a thickness of 25 μm, which is about 7.64% higher than that of the Pt-based cell (8.51%). This shows that ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS CEs can be used in DSSCs as a Pt CE for large-scale applications.


3.3.2 Application of ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS CEs in cobalt electrolyte. 
It is well-known that I−/I3− is the most used redox couple in DSSCs. However, there are limitations to its commercial applications, due to corrosion of metal CE components and the absorption of visible light, and thus significant loss of open circuit voltage and short circuit current density.69 Recently, many alternative redox couples, such as (Co2+/Co3+) complexes,69,71 TEMPO,72 (Br3−/Br−),73 (T2−/T−)74 and copper complexes have been used in DSSCs.75,76 Great efforts have been directed towards the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ complexes as a redox shuttle, due to not only their low corrosiveness toward metallic CEs, but also their higher redox potential.77 Herein, for the first time, ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS CEs are employed as CEs in DSSCs based on the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox couple. The electrocatalytic activity of the prepared CEs and the total performance of the fabricated DSSCs were evaluated. From CV in Fig. 7a and 8a, the ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS CE exhibits a higher current density compared to both the PEDOT:PSS and Pt CEs, indicating the higher catalytic activity toward the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox reaction, which may be attributed to the high surface area available for the electrocatalytic reduction at the surface of the electrodes. In addition, the peak–peak separation (EPP) of PEDOT:PSS (530 mV) greatly reduces upon the addition of ZnO-NC, leading to enhancement of the catalytic activity. Based on the Jsc and EPP, 7% ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS shows the best catalytic activity toward the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox reaction. The peak current density shows a linear relationship with the scan rate as shown in Fig. S8a,† indicating that the cathodic and anodic redox reactions are diffusion-limited by the transport of cobalt species toward the counter electrode. From Fig. S8b,† no obvious changes in peak current density were observed even after 50 consecutive scans, indicating outstanding electrochemical stability. The Nyquist plots of the symmetric cells provided in Fig. 7b and 8b reveal that all cells show two semicircles, and the equivalent circuit of the assembled symmetric cells is given in Fig. 8b. The recorded data showed that on increasing the ZnO-NC content, the Rct decreases to 1.44 Ω for the 7% ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS CE, which is negligible compared to that of the PEDOT:PSS CE (14.16 Ω) and Pt CE (2.37 Ω). Such a smaller Rct value results from the higher surface area and thus higher number of active sites available for the catalytic reduction. The lifetime (τ) for 7% ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS (5.78 μs) is lower than that of Pt (23.02 μs), suggesting an outstanding catalytic activity toward the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox shuttle. Moreover, the larger slope of the cathodic branch of the 7% ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS CE than PEDOT:PSS and Pt CEs in the Tafel plots (Fig. 7c and 8c) reveals that the 7% ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS CE has greater electrocatalytic performance toward the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ reduction reaction. In order to investigate the potential of the prepared counter electrodes in the total performance of DSSCs with the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox mediator, a series of devices with different CEs were assembled and tested. The recorded J–V curves are shown in Fig. 7d and 8d and the related data are provided in Table 3. The total performance of the DSSCs with PEDOT:PSS (5.90%) is quite low for commercial applications, mainly due to the low Jsc as previously reported.50 The higher conversion efficiency obtained by using the ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS CE is due to the enhanced Jsc. The energy conversion efficiency of the cell with the 7% ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS CE reached 8.12%, which is superior to that of the Pt-based cell (7.49%). The enhanced conversion efficiency is due to the increase of Jsc as a result of increasing the number of catalytic active sites toward the reduction of the Co3+ ions.

4 Conclusions
In summary, by a simple spin coating method, ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS composite CEs have been prepared and investigated as Pt-free CEs for DSSCs based on the I3−/I− and [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox mediators. The electrochemical analysis reveals that ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS has a higher catalytic activity toward I3−/I− and [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+. In addition, the prepared CEs exhibit a higher electrochemical stability. The assembled DSSC based on the 7% ZnO-NC-PEDOT:PSS CE exhibits high-power conversion efficiencies of 9.12% and 8.12% for I3−/I− and [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+, respectively. Both of these values are higher than those of Pt-based cells, and thus the ZnO-NC/PEDOT:PSS CE is a promising candidate for use as a low-cost CE in large-scale DSSC production.
