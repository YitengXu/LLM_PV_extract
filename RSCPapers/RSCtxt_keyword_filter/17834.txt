    , Accepted 12th January 2015First published on 13th January 2015AbstractThe pressure is introduced as a parameter in the post-treat process for perovskite solar cells. Via a hot-pressing method, the rough surface of perovskite film becomes smooth, and the pin-holes can be cured. This modified perovskite morphology can help to improve charge transporting and eliminate recombination in the perovskite solar cells. Moreover, significantly enhanced photovoltaic performances with high PCEs of 10.84% and 16.07% are thus achieved in HTM-free type and spiro-OMeTAD based cells, respectively.
In recent years, inorganic–organic hybrid perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 and its analogues have been seen as star materials in the photovoltaic field.1 With a series of miraculous properties, such as strong absorption coefficients, low non-radiative carrier recombination rates and ease of fabrication, these perovskite materials were successfully employed in different types of solar cells (mesoporous structure vs. planer structure, hole-transporting material contained type vs. hole-transporting material free type).2–5 The highest certified power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of these so-called perovskite solar cells can reach 20.1%. Moreover, the simple fabrication process of perovskite materials also helps to reduce the cost of perovskite solar cells, promising potential commercial applications. Currently, these perovskite materials can be deposited on the cell substrate by directly mixing the corresponding metal halide and amine halide via in situ solution processes as a one-step method or sequential deposition method.6,7 However, the fast crystallization of perovskite material with solvent evaporation may result in uncontrollable film morphology, and thus affect the cell performance.8,9 To solve this issue, the post-treatment of thermal annealing is commonly adopted to modify the morphology and improve the crystallinity, and its effect has been widely recognized.10,11 Based on this, even a new solvent annealing method was developed to further improve the cell performance.12,13
Herein, we introduce the pressure as a parameter for the first time and post-treat the perovskite with a hot-pressing process. After hot-pressing, the top surface of the perovskite layer will become smoother and more compact; moreover, the pin-holes can be cured. Moreover, the charge transporting and recombination properties in the devices are improved. According to these changes, the cell performances are distinctly enhanced for both hole-transporting material free (HTM-free) type and spiro-OMeTAD based perovskite solar cells, yielding high PCEs of 10.84% and 16.07%, respectively.
The preparation procedure of perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 is exhibited in Scheme 1. In this work, the perovskite is deposited on FTO/mesoporous TiO2 substrate via the sequential deposition method.14 Specifically, first spin-coating PbI2 in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution on the substrate to form PbI2 filled and covered structure, and then dipping into CH3NH3I isopropanol solution to achieve the chemical conversion from PbI2 to CH3NH3PbI3. Subsequently, this FTO/mesoporous TiO2/perovskite film is placed on a hot-press machine and the hot-pressing operation is performed under certain temperature and pressure.

Fig. 1a is the SEM image of a partially hot-pressed perovskite film. A piece of Teflon film is attached on the surface of the perovskite film to avoid contamination by the hot plate. Thus, the area with Teflon on it will be post-treated by hot-pressing, such as the left part in Fig. 1a, while the other area will be just thermally annealed, as shown in the right part. Apparently, the right part and left part are quite different in appearance. The thermally annealed perovskite film has a rough surface, and in contrast, the hot-pressed part is quite smooth and flat. Fig. 1b and c are the corresponding high-resolution SEM images of thermally annealed and hot-pressed areas. As can be seen, the surface layer of perovskite prepared by sequential deposition is composed mainly of about 200 nm-sized grains and even some larger particles, which are stacked together and show a porous structure, as reported by other researchers.15 Post-treated via hot-pressing, the surface becomes quite smooth and compact. The large perovskite particles disappear, and the grains are deformed to fill a plane. Even the pin-holes in the former porous structure are almost cured. This surface morphology is quite similar to the ones obtained by some modified perovskite deposition methods, such as additives or solvent engineering.9,16–19 Although inorganic–organic hybrid perovskite is soft due to its relatively weak chemical bands in the compound,20 without heating, the pressure can hardly afford this modification, as shown in Fig. S1.†

The effect of the hot-pressing process on the crystal structure was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD). FTO/mesoporous TiO2/perovskite films were first thermally annealed for a while, and then hot-pressed for a different time. The characteristic peaks of CH3NH3PbI3's (100) and (200) lattice planes can be seen in Fig. 2. A trace amount of residual PbI2 is also shown in the XRD patterns, which is difficult to avoid in sequential deposition.21 The peak intensity ratio of CH3NH3PbI3 and PbI2 has no change under a different operation time. Moreover, the absolute intensity of (100) and (200) peaks increased and half peak width decreased slightly while extending the hot-pressing time, indicating the improved crystallinity and grown grains. It is revealed that the hot-pressing process has no significant effect on the composition of perovskite film, and it only changes the morphology, as a physical process.

Perovskite was also deposited on slide glass/mesoporous Al2O3 substrate for photoluminescence (PL) measurement. Due to the insulating substrate, the time-resolved PL decay spectra can reflect the quality of individual perovskite films, as shown in Fig. 3a. The hot-pressed sample has nearly the same PL lifetime (τ = 14.9 vs. 14.0 ns) and even overlapped the decay curve with the no hot-pressing sample, once again confirming the composition stability of perovskite under hot-pressing conditions. However, in the case of FTO/mesoporous TiO2 based samples, the research object is quite different. The TiO2 will extract the photo-generated electron from perovskite and quench PL; therefore, the corresponding decay spectra can represent the charge transfer characteristics of the TiO2/perovskite composite system.22,23 After hot-pressing, the PL lifetime amazingly decreased from 12.0 ns to 7.6 ns with a rapid PL intensity decay. This phenomenon can be attributed to the shorter carrier-transporting distance between perovskite grains or from perovskite to TiO2 in the compact perovskite film than that in the porous structure, as shown in Fig. 3c. It should be the smooth carrier-transporting capacity that accelerates the PL decay.

Evaporating an Au electrode to fabricate HTM-free structured perovskite solar cells, the J–V characteristics were tested under both standard AM 1.5 illumination and dark conditions. The J–V curves of best cells with either condition are shown as Fig. 4a, and the parameters are exhibited in Table 1. High PCEs of 9.16% and 10.84% were achieved in thermally annealed and hot-pressed devices, which are among the best results with perovskite/Au contact.14,24 In comparison, the cell with hot-pressing exhibits better performance. Specifically, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) values are almost the same (0.919 vs. 0.922 V) in the cells with and without hot-pressing, consistent with the substantially coincident dark current curves. However, the short-circuit current density (Jsc) is enhanced from 15.62 to 16.70 mA cm−2. The statistical data of ten devices fabricated with either condition are also provided in Fig. S2,† showing the same result. Further measuring the incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra, the IPCE values of the hot-pressed device are significantly enhanced in the long wavelength region, as shown in Fig. 4c. Considering that the optical property of perovskite film maintains no change during the hot-pressing, this difference may be attributed to the higher electron separation and collection efficiency, especially at the back contact region,14 thus increasing the Jsc value. Moreover, the fill factor (FF) is significantly improved from 0.638 to 0.704. Observing the shape of J–V curves, it can be seen that the one representing the thermally annealed cell exhibits a smaller slope around the Voc, indicating a larger series resistance value than the hot-pressed one. These improvements on carrier separation/collection efficiency and conductance of the entire device should be due to the enhanced charge-transporting capacity confirmed by PL decay.

As reported to date, the perovskite solar cells with spiro-OMeTAD as HTM exhibit superior performances to the HTM-free cells.12 We also fabricated spiro-OMeTAD based cells to investigate the influence of hot-pressing. When spin-coating a spiro-OMeTAD layer on the perovskite, and then evaporating the Au electrode, the obtained cells can yield higher PCEs of 13.55% and 16.07%, as shown in Fig. 4b. The extra HTM can favor the separation and transporting of carriers, thus significantly increasing the Jsc value. Consequently, the IPCE values of spiro-OMeTAD based cells are enhanced within a wide range of wavelengths from 350 to 750 nm, as shown in Fig. 4d. Similarly, the hot-pressed cells exhibit better performance, but the main different parameters are Voc and FF in this case. The Voc increased from 0.934 to 0.962 V and the FF from 0.664 to 0.742 after the hot-pressing operation. Through the shape of photocurrent density and dark current density curves, it can be inferred that the improvement on Voc and FF may be due to the lower charge recombination rate.
This inference can be further examined with the transient photovoltage spectroscopy method, which is always used to evaluate the charge recombination rate.13 As shown in Fig. 5a, in the case of an HTM-free structure, the photovoltage decay curves of cells with and without hot-pressing are essentially coincident, whereas, in the spiro-OMeTAD based cells, the hot-pressing process evidently slows up this decay (Fig. 5b). It is revealed that the improvement on the Voc value is indeed related to the depressed recombination.

Considering that the recombination rates have no change for the HTM-free devices, it should be the introduction of HTM that renders the difference. In this work, the perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 is deposited on mesoporous TiO2, forming a bilayer structure. However, the upper layer of individual perovskite exhibits a porous structure, and the TiO2 nanocrystalline in the lower layer may be incompletely coated. Therefore, strong charge recombination will occur when the spiro-OMeTAD infiltrates into the pin-hole and directly contacts the bare TiO2, whereas after being hot-pressed, the perovskite upper layer becomes compact with rare pin-holes. This change in morphology can effectively prevent the direct contact between TiO2 and HTM, eliminating this recombination, as shown in Fig. 5c. A similar phenomenon was reported in planer perovskite solar cells.25
Conclusions
In conclusion, we introduce the pressure as a parameter in the post-treat process for perovskite solar cells. Via a hot-pressing method, a compact perovskite layer with smooth surface and rare pin-holes can be prepared on the mesoporous TiO2. PL and photovoltage decay spectra suggest improved charge transporting and reduced recombination with this modified morphology. Thus, significantly enhanced photovoltaic performance can be achieved in both HTM-free and spiro-OMeTAD based cells with high PCEs of 10.84% and 16.07%, respectively. Future work on applying this post-treat method to perovskite solar cells with other device structures and deposition method would be expected to further improve the photovoltaic performance.
