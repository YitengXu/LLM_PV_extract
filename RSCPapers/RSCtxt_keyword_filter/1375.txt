    , Accepted 11th December 2018First published on 12th December 2018AbstractOrganic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) employing a mesoporous metal-oxide scaffold are now at the forefront of solution-processed photovoltaic cells, yielding a power conversion efficiency exceeding 23%. However, processing temperatures of up to 450 °C are typically required to sinter mesoporous metal-oxide scaffolds, which hinders the fabrication of low-cost and flexible devices. Moreover, these metal-oxide scaffolds usually suffer from high charge carrier recombination rates and inherent UV instability. In this paper, we develop for the first time an organic-scaffold architecture, which consists of room-temperature-processed C60 single-crystalline nanoparticles (C60-NPs) serving as an electron selective contact covering on C60 compact films (c-C60). C60-NPs act as a three-dimensional framework to support perovskite crystals, enabling them to cover the substrate more uniformly and thus demonstrating an advantage over planar heterojunction PSCs. Furthermore, the higher electron mobility of C60-NPs compared with commonly used TiO2 enhances the charge transfer from the perovskite to electron transport layers and reduces charge carrier accumulation at the interface, demonstrating the advantage of an organic scaffold over inorganic metal-oxides for mesoporous scaffold PSCs. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.45% was obtained in organic-scaffold MAPbI3-based perovskite solar cells (OPSCs), outperforming standard reference devices based on a TiO2 mesoporous scaffold (maximum PCE = 17.07%). Furthermore, the high UV stability of C60-NPs enables the realisation of ultra-stable OPSCs stressed under ambient conditions and working under both UV and full-sun illumination. Moreover, the devices can be easily processed at low temperatures, providing an efficient method for the large-scale production of flexible PSCs. These flexible PSCs show remarkable performance with an excellent PCE of 17.28%, which is among the highest values reported for MAPbI3-based flexible PSCs to date. This work reveals that organic nanostructures as n-type charge collection layers are ideal replacements for inorganic mesoporous scaffolds as they achieve remarkably high efficiency and long-term operational stability in both rigid and flexible perovskite solar cells.
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have made impressive advancement since they were first discovered in 2009, and their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has developed from 3.81 to 23.2% by means of solvent engineering, interface engineering, and composition engineering, which comes close to the performance of polycrystalline silicon photovoltaics.1–12 Two dominant device architectures, namely planar heterojunction and mesoporous scaffold structures, have been developed.13–16 Planar heterojunction PSCs are either fabricated layer by layer via high-vacuum deposition or solution-based methods.5,16,17 However, the high-vacuum deposition method requires complex equipment and consumes energy, while the formation of a homogeneous film using the low-cost solution-processing method is difficult due to the dewetting process and sensitivity to the atmosphere.17–19 Because of these limitations, most efficient devices still employ a mesoscopic TiO2 scaffold as an electron-selective layer despite the significant progress made in planar PSCs.20–24 However, the preparation of inorganic metal oxide nanostructures as mesoporous scaffolds is complex and requires sintering at a high temperature of >450 °C, which makes them unsuitable for flexible PSCs.25 Therefore, the development of a low-temperature-processed electron-selective scaffold is urgently needed.
Fullerenes and their derivatives are among the most widely used n-type materials in organic electronic devices as they have both a suitable energy level alignment and superior electron mobility.26–29 Furthermore, fullerene materials can be easily processed into single-crystalline nanostructures at room temperature, such as zero-dimensional nanoparticles, one-dimensional nanowires, and two-dimensional nanoribbons.30–35 Therefore, developing fullerene nanostructures as a room-temperature-processed organic electron-selective scaffold would constitute a significant development for PSCs. In this paper, we report a novel perovskite solar cell architecture based on a single-crystalline C60 nanoparticle (C60-NP) scaffold. The single-crystalline C60-NPs are simply prepared at room temperature and are then deposited by spin-coating onto a C60 compact layer (c-C60) to form the organic scaffold. As a three-dimensional skeleton, C60-NPs improve the wettability between the C60 compact layer and the precursor for the CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) film, thereby enabling perovskite crystals to cover the substrate more uniformly and decrease the defect concentration of the perovskite film. Moreover, compared to the conventionally used electron-transport architecture – the compact TiO2 layer/mesoporous TiO2 scaffold (c-TiO2/m-TiO2), the proposed organic scaffold architecture enhances electron extraction and transport and reduces charge accumulation at the interface. The organic-scaffold MAPbI3-based perovskite solar cells (OPSCs) achieved an average PCE of (18.41 ± 0.54)%, a value significantly higher than those of standard reference PSCs based on c-TiO2/m-TiO2 (maximum PCE = 17.07%). Furthermore, due to the high UV stability of C60-NPs, this approach facilitates the realisation of ultra-stable PSCs that are stressed under ambient conditions and work under both UV and one-sun illumination. Notably, OPSCs retain 80% of their initial performance after 720 h of continuous stress testing under ambient conditions under one-sun illumination at continuous maximum power, thus approaching the standards required for industrial stability. Most importantly of all, the devices can be easily processed at low temperatures, offering an efficient method for the large-scale production of flexible PSCs. These flexible PSCs exhibit remarkable performance with an excellent PCE of 17.28% and good mechanical tolerance, which is among the highest values reported for flexible PSCs to date.
The C60-NPs were formed in a solvent mixture of toluene and ethanol, following the method described by Andrievsky et al.36,37 The nanoparticles that we obtained were then filtered and moved into vigorously stirred ethanol and a highly concentrated dispersion containing 5 mg mL−1 of C60-NPs was then prepared. Finally, the as-prepared C60-NP dispersion was spin-coated onto a thermally deposited C60 compact layer to form the organic scaffold architecture. Further details regarding preparation can be found in the Experimental section (ESI†). It is important to note that the whole preparation process was conducted at room temperature without any thermal treatment.
To characterise the morphology of as-prepared nanoparticles, the atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images in Fig. 1a and b are presented to show that the C60 particles used are very uniform. As shown in the distribution curve in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the average sizes of the nanoparticles were calculated to be 76.22 ± 18.40 nm by measuring the diameter of 200 nanoparticles. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) results (Fig. 1c) indicate that the as-prepared C60 nanoparticles are crystalline and the marked periodicity 0.803 nm corresponds to the spacing distance of the (111) plane. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of individual C60-NPs is shown in Fig. 1d. The presence of discrete diffraction points in the SAED patterns was observed, indicating single crystallinity of the nanoparticle. The XRD patterns of the C60-NPs (Fig. 1e) can be indexed to a face-centred cubic (FCC) crystal system, where it is notable that the (200) reflection is missing. The extinction of the (200) reflection is typical of pristine FCC C60 crystals.38 The lattice constant of the C60-NPs is a = 1.413 nm, which is well consistent with the 1.415 nm value of pristine C60 crystals.39 We have previously reported that the highly ordered molecular organisation of organic single crystals can remarkably enhance their charge transport properties.33 Therefore, the single-crystalline nature of as-prepared C60-NPs is beneficial for charge transfer when using them as a charge transport layer, which may also significantly reduce charge accumulation at the interfaces. Spin-coating the C60-NP dispersion onto a C60 compact layer can form a dense, pinhole-free film (Fig. 1f). Additionally, the c-C60/C60-NPs that were prepared showed enhanced transmittance in the visible region compared to c-TiO2/m-TiO2 (Fig. S2, ESI†). This high transparency can effectively avoid the parasitic absorption of the perovskite absorber to maximize the resultant photocurrent of the relevant PSCs.40

As shown in Fig. 2a–c, the organic-scaffold architecture inherits the basic structure of PSCs with an inorganic mesoporous scaffold.13–15 In this architecture, inorganic nanocrystal scaffolds are replaced with organic C60-NP networks that can be processed at room temperature, as noted previously. The fabrication of organic-scaffold perovskite solar cells (OPSCs), which is included in detail in the Experimental section (ESI†), is similar to that of PSCs based on an inorganic mesoporous scaffold. The surface wettability of the contacted film is important for the formation of a high-quality MAPbI3 film.28 The dewetting of C60 compact thin films can result in a MAPbI3 film with incomplete coverage and a non-uniform film after solution-processing and subsequent baking.41,42 According to the literature, the dewetting of thin films becomes completely suppressed following the addition of a small amount of C60-NPs, which stabilises the film by apparent pinning.42–45 Therefore, the employment of C60-NPs in this experiment may improve the wettability between the C60 compact film and the precursor solution for the perovskite film. To study the effect of C60-NPs on the surface wettability, we measured the contact angles of the MAPbI3 precursor solution on different surfaces. As shown in Fig. 2d and e, the contact angle of the MAPbI3 precursor solution on the C60 compact film was 62.7°, which is much larger compared to C60 films covered with C60-NPs (16.1°). Thus, the wettability between the C60 compact film and the perovskite precursor solution can be significantly improved by C60-NPs, which may facilitate the spreading of the perovskite precursor solutions and the formation of high-quality MAPbI3 films. For comparison, we also examined the wettability of the c-TiO2/m-TiO2 film in which the perovskite precursor has a contact angle of 38.5°, a value significantly higher than that for an organic scaffold (c-C60/C60-NPs). Therefore, it was expected that higher-quality perovskite films can be formed on an organic scaffold (c-C60/C60-NPs) than on an inorganic scaffold (c-TiO2/m-TiO2). To verify this hypothesis, SEM observation was carried out. Fig. 2g and h present the top-view SEM images of the perovskite films with and without an organic scaffold. Perovskite films without a scaffold display pinholes and bare substrates, raising the risk of short circuits. By contrast, perovskite films on a scaffold show continuous and complete coverage, demonstrating an advantage over planar heterojunction PSCs. Furthermore, uniformly spread organic scaffolds work as TiO2 scaffolds but, compared to perovskite films on TiO2 scaffolds, can also support perovskite crystal growth with larger grain sizes of up to several micrometres (Fig. 2h and i). Moreover, organic scaffolds can be prepared in a less costly and much simpler way, which further demonstrates the advantage of an organic scaffold over an inorganic mesoporous scaffold for perovskite solar cells.

To compare the charge generation efficiency, we measured the optical absorption of MAPbI3 films on an organic scaffold and an inorganic mesoporous scaffold, the data for which are displayed in Fig. 3a. The absorption intensity of the MAPbI3 film on an organic scaffold (c-C60/C60-NPs) is a little stronger than that on an inorganic mesoporous scaffold (c-TiO2/m-TiO2). This may be due to the larger perovskite grains.

In addition to the efficiency of charge generation, charge-carrier mobility also affects the performance of the device. The low mobility of the electron transport layer (ETL) indicates more traps and will slow down charge transport. This could lead to charge accumulation at the interface, which will induce an energy barrier to suppress the charge transport.46 To compare the charge transport properties in the organic and inorganic scaffolds, we measured the mobility of c-C60/C60-NPs and c-TiO2/m-TiO2 films following the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method,47 the results of which are presented in Fig. 3b. The mobility of the c-C60/C60-NPs film was found to be approximately 1.2 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is much higher than that of c-TiO2/m-TiO2 (4.2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). This indicates that, compared to the c-TiO2/m-TiO2 architecture, the c-C60/C60-NPs architecture can offer more rapid charge transport through the ETLs.
The interfacial charge transfer process plays a vital role in the charge recombination and device efficiency.8 To understand the charge transfer process in PSCs, the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were collected to reveal the charge transport behavior at the interface of ETL/perovskite.48,49Fig. 3c shows the PL spectra of the perovskite, c-TiO2/m-TiO2/perovskite and c-C60/C60-NPs/perovskite. The spectra of the perovskite films all showed an emission peak of ∼770 nm, which is typical of MAPbI3, but in each case the intensity of the peak was substantially less than that of the peak for MAPbI3 on glass. It is clear that both c-C60/C60-NPs and c-TiO2/m-TiO2 underlayers quenched the perovskite emission, and the c-C60/C60-NP underlayer exhibited stronger quenching compared to the c-TiO2/m-TiO2 underlayer. This indicates that c-C60/C60-NPs allowed more efficient electron extraction and transport from the perovskite to the ETLs. Moreover, we investigated the TRPL lifetimes for perovskites on ITO, ITO/c-C60/C60-NPs, and ITO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2. As shown in Fig. 4d, the TRPL plots were fitted via a biexponential equation (eqn (1)) f(t) = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2) + B(1)where τ1 and τ2 are slow and fast decay time constants, respectively, A1 and A2 are their corresponding decay amplitudes, and B is a constant.50 For the MAPbI3 sample, the τ1 and τ2 were 69.32 and 12.79 ns, respectively. When the inorganic mesoporous scaffold c-TiO2/m-TiO2 was introduced, the τ1 and τ2 both decreased to 48.10 and 8.70 ns, respectively. When the organic scaffold c-C60/C60-NPs was introduced, the τ1 and τ2 decreased further to 43.84 and 3.79 ns, respectively. Apparently, the perovskite/organic scaffold system can provide a faster electron transfer process and lower interface recombination compared with the perovskite/inorganic mesoporous scaffold system. Therefore, the charge transportation and injection get improved and less charge accumulation occurs at the interface of ETL/perovskite, thus leading to the reduced hysteresis behavior in the device with the organic scaffold, as discussed in the following section.20,28,51 Moreover, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also employed to investigate the interfacial carrier transfer and recombination kinetics in PSCs.8 Fig. S3a† shows the Nyquist plots measured under dark conditions with the equivalent circuit in the inset for the devices with the c-TiO2/m-TiO2 and c-C60/C60-NPs ETLs, respectively. The high frequency semicircle is attributed to the transport resistance (Rtr), whereas the low frequency part is determined by the recombination resistance (Rrec).52 Due to the simplified transmission line model, the high frequency semicircle is almost indistinguishable and the Nyquist plots in Fig. S3a,† showing a main semicircle at low frequency, are in accordance with the recombination processes. As shown in Fig. S3b,† the recombination resistance is closely related to the applied bias with the fitted Rrec values of the organic scaffold devices much higher compared with inorganic scaffold devices. Therefore, the organic scaffold devices can inhibit the charge carrier recombination and improve the interfacial charge transfer.

Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows the typical device structure of the n-i-p perovskite solar cell which consists of gold/spiro-OMeTAD/MAPbI3/m-TiO2/c-TiO2/fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO)/glass. This device served as a control device for comparison. To examine the performance of the c-C60/C60-NP organic scaffold, we fabricated OPSCs by replacing the TiO2 compact and mesoporous layers with the C60 compact layer and C60-NPs. For OPSCs based on an organic scaffold, the ETL formation did not need the high-temperature processing. Therefore, an indium-tin oxide (ITO) electrode with higher transmittance than the FTO electrode in a visible range was utilised as a cathode on a glass substrate. A C60 compact layer with a thickness of 10 nm was deposited on the ITO/glass substrate using thermal evaporation in a vacuum environment upon which C60-NPs were then spin-coated as an organic scaffold. MAPbI3 was then deposited onto the C60-NP scaffold and the hole transport material spiro-OMeTAD was spin-coated on top of the MAPbI3 layer. Lastly, the anode, gold, was thermally evaporated to finalise the device fabrication. Further details concerning device fabrication can be found in the Experimental section (ESI†). A schematic diagram and cross-sectional SEM image of the final device are displayed in Fig. 4a and b.

Fig. 4c depicts the typical J–V characteristics of the champion devices based on c-C60/C60-NPs and c-TiO2/m-TiO2 under AM 1.5 G illumination. The average values and standard deviations of key photovoltaic parameters are summarised in Table 1. Firstly, we investigated the effect of the thickness of C60-NPs on the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells. Fig. S5a† shows the dependence of PCE (measured from the reverse scan) on the C60-NP thickness. As shown in Fig. S5b–e,† in the absence of C60-NPs, i.e. when the thickness of C60-NPs is 0 nm, the cells gave a relatively lower open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) compared to the cells employing C60-NPs. This is due to the lower-quality perovskite crystals formed directly on the C60 compact layer and the relatively poor electron collection ability of the C60 compact layer due to the small contact surface. When employing C60-NPs as an organic scaffold, the PCE changed mainly due to the change of FF as shown in Fig. S5.† The optimum thickness of C60-NPs that exhibited the highest PCE at 19.45% was determined to be 50 nm. The PCE decreased as the C60-NP thickness increased over 50 nm. This was due to the decreased conductivity of thick C60-NPs that increased the series resistance of the device and resulted in a lower FF (Fig. S5d and e†). The PCE also decreased as the C60-NP thickness decreased below 50 nm. Considering that the C60-NPs have a particle size from 40 to 100 nm, this performance reduction was possibly due to pinholes or tunneling recombination on the thinnest C60-NP layer. When applying the optimized C60-NP thickness, the PSC based on c-C60/C60-NPs yielded the highest PCE of 19.45% with a VOC of 1.08 V, a JSC of 22.79 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.79, clearly outperforming the PSCs based on c-TiO2/m-TiO2 ETLs. The best-performing reference cell using c-TiO2/m-TiO2 ETLs gave a JSC of 22.10 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.99 V, FF of 0.78, and PCE of 17.07%. These values are comparable with those of a previous report on devices with the same structure.53 The improved photovoltaic performances of the c-C60/C60-NP devices can be attributed to the following causes: (1) the high electron mobility of c-C60/C60-NPs facilitated electron extraction and transport from the perovskite to the ETLs, effectively hindering charge recombination at the ETL/perovskite interface; (2) C60-NPs well supported the perovskite active layer which has large grains and fewer grain boundaries; (3) the uniform MAPbI3 films formed on the c-C60/C60-NP substrate improved interfacial contact between the MAPbI3 layers and the electron transport layers and, furthermore, reduced recombination centres in the perovskite films; these result in the enhanced photovoltaic properties. It has previously been reported that fullerene layers can effectively passivate the charge trap states in the perovskite and eliminate the hysteresis in PSCs.54J–V curves, shown in Fig. 4c, indicate that the commonly observed hysteresis in c-TiO2/m-TiO2 PSCs is virtually negligible in the devices based on c-C60/C60-NPs.

The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the PSCs based on different ETLs are displayed in Fig. 4d. The integrated current densities calculated from the IPCE spectra are 21.41 and 22.19 mA cm−2 for solar cells based on c-TiO2/m-TiO2 and c-C60/C60-NPs, respectively. These are in good agreement with the JSC values achieved from the J–V curves. Fig. 4e shows the stabilised photocurrent density and power conversion efficiency at the maximum power point (0.89 V). A stable output efficiency of 19.37% was demonstrated. The performance reproducibility of OPSCs was studied by characterising 50 devices in the same batch. Histograms displaying the key parameters of these devices (Fig. 4e and S6–S9†) indicate excellent reproducibility.
Owing to the photocatalytic activity of TiO2, the ETL employing it tends to result in the degradation of PSCs under UV light.55 Eliminating this unwanted effect is significant for the practical application of PSCs.55Fig. 5 presents the long-term stability studies of PSCs stored under three different aging conditions: (i) under darkness at 25 °C at 40% relative humidity without encapsulation; (ii) under continuous UV illumination (1 mW cm−2, λ = 365 nm) at 25 °C and 40% relative humidity without encapsulation; (iii) under continuous full-sun illumination at the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) at 25 °C and 40% relative humidity with encapsulation. It can clearly be seen that, when stored under darkness, the PSCs based on C60/C60-NPs and c-TiO2/m-TiO2 both exhibit good long-term stability, maintaining over 90% of their initial performance after 1200 hours without encapsulation. However, when the unencapsulated devices were under exposure to 1 mW cm−2 UV illumination (λ = 365 nm), the PCE of the c-TiO2/m-TiO2 device decreases sharply and its performance is lost after 800 hours. According to the literature,56,57 the drop-off in the performance of the TiO2-based devices is mainly due to the intrinsic UV instability of TiO2. On the one hand, in the presence of UV light, photogenerated holes at the surface of TiO2 react with oxygen absorbed at surface oxygen vacancies, and this results in an increased quantity of deep traps and an increase in the rate of charge recombination;56 On the other hand, following UV-light exposure, electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 can transform oxygen into hydroxyl radicals and the oxygen molecules absorbed on the TiO2 trap states are likely to be reduced to HO˙ and H2O, which promotes the degradation of the MAPbI3 perovskite material.57 In contrast, the c-C60/C60-NP device aged under the same illumination and storage conditions maintains about 90% of its initial performance after 1200 hours, showing the outstanding UV stability of C60/C60-NP devices. To further explore the potential of c-C60/C60-NP devices, the long-term lifetime of the encapsulated cells is recorded under continuous full-sun illumination at a temperature of 25 °C at 40% relative humidity, where the maximum power output is tracked constantly. The test is applied to devices based on C60/C60-NPs and c-TiO2/m-TiO2, respectively, until the time at which 20% PCE (T80) is lost. As shown in Fig. 5, the PSCs based on the c-TiO2/m-TiO2 ETL reached T80 after 85 hours of the applied stress test, while, in the same timeframe, the C60/C60-NP-based PSC retained 98% of its initial PCE. In fact, the C60/C60-NP-based PSC reached T80 after 720 h of continuous stress testing. The use of the C60/C60-NP ETL in PSCs showed a much stronger resistance to degradation during a much longer time period compared with devices based on the c-TiO2/m-TiO2 ETL. This reveals that the organic scaffold is potentially the ideal material for electron collection layers to obtain both highly efficient and long-term stable PSCs.
 Fig. 5  Long-term stability of the corresponding perovskite solar cells under three aging conditions: (i) storage under darkness at 25 °C and 40% relative humidity without encapsulation; (ii) storage under continuous UV illumination (1 mW cm−2, λ = 365 nm) at 25 °C and 40% relative humidity without encapsulation; (iii) storage under continuous full-sun illumination at the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) at 25 °C and 40% relative humidity with encapsulation. 
The room-temperature-processed organic scaffold enables the fabrication of flexible solar cells, and to demonstrate this, we fabricated MAPbI3 PSCs with the c-C60/C60-NP ETL on ITO-coated polyethylene naphthalate (ITO/PEN) substrates. A digital photograph and schematic diagram of the final device are shown in Fig. 6a. A flexible OPSC was therefore demonstrated for the first time with a PCE as high as 17.28%, which is one of the highest values among flexible MAPbI3 solar cells (Fig. 6b). The device performance of the best flexible OPSC, measured in different voltage scan directions, is summarised in the inset table in Fig. 6b. The performance reproducibility of flexible OPSCs was studied by characterising 50 devices in the same batch. Histograms displaying the key parameters of these devices (Fig. S10–S13†) indicate excellent reproducibility. The average values of the device performance calculated from 50 flexible OPSCs are presented in Table 2. To examine the stability of OPSCs against the mechanical bending, a bending test including 1000 consecutive bending cycles was carried out at two different radii of curvature (R) of 10 mm and 5 mm. When R was 10 mm, the flexible OPSC exhibited no efficiency drop-off, maintaining 100% of its initial PCE after 1000 bending cycles, as demonstrated in Fig. 6c. Furthermore, when R was 5 mm, the flexible OPSCs retained 95% of initial efficiency after 100 bending cycles, and maintained more than 90% of initial efficiency after 1000 cycles (Fig. 6c). Therefore, these analyses demonstrate that our flexible OPSCs exhibit excellent stability under mechanical bending, indicating the great potential of OPSCs for practical applications.

In summary, we demonstrated a novel perovskite solar cell architecture based on room-temperature-processed single-crystalline C60 nanoparticles (C60-NPs) serving as an efficient electron-selective layer. C60-NPs, acting as a three-dimensional skeleton, improve the wettability between the C60 compact layer (c-C60) and the precursor for the MAPbI3 film, therefore enabling perovskite crystals to cover the substrate more uniformly and decrease the defect concentration of the perovskite film. Moreover, compared to the conventionally used electron-transport architecture c-TiO2/m-TiO2, the proposed organic scaffold architecture enhances electron transport and extraction and reduces charge accumulation at the interface. The organic-scaffold perovskite solar cells (OPSCs) achieved a highest PCE of 19.45%, outperforming those of standard reference PSCs based on c-TiO2/m-TiO2 (the highest PCE = 17.07%). Furthermore, c-C60/C60-NPs efficiently enhanced the UV stability of PSCs due to their inherent UV stability compared to traditional c-TiO2/m-TiO2 ETLs. Most strikingly, the devices can be easily processed at low temperatures, offering an efficient method for the large-scale production of flexible PSCs. These flexible PSCs show remarkable performance with an excellent PCE of 17.28% and good mechanical tolerance, which is among the highest values reported for flexible PSCs to date. This work reveals that organic nanostructures as n-type charge collection layers are excellent replacements for inorganic mesoporous scaffolds as they achieve remarkably high efficiency and long-term operational stability in both rigid and flexible perovskite solar cells.
