    , Accepted 17th April 2016First published on 18th April 2016AbstractTo fully utilize the multiple exciton generation effects in quantum dots and improve the overall efficiency of the corresponding photovoltaic devices, nanostructuralizing the electron conducting layer turns out to be a feasible strategy. Herein, PbS quantum dot solar cells were fabricated on the basis of morphologically optimized TiO2 nanorod arrays. By inserting a thin layer of CdSe quantum dots into the interface of TiO2 and PbS, a dramatic enhancement in the power conversion efficiency from 4.2% to 5.2% was realized and the resulting efficiency is one of the highest values for quantum dot solar cells based on nanostructuralized buffer layers. The constructed double heterojunction with a cascade type-II energy level alignment is beneficial for promoting photogenerated charge separation and reducing charge recombination, thereby responsible for the performance improvement, as revealed by steady-state analyses as well as ultra-fast photoluminescence and photovoltage decays. Thus this paper provides a good buffer layer to the community of quantum dot solar cells.
Introduction
Recently, quantum dot (QD) solar cells have emerged as an ideal paradigm to harvest the excess photon energies (relative to the band gap) as additional charge carriers via multiple exciton generation.1–3 An extraordinarily high external quantum yield, even larger than 100%, has been reported.4–6 After being generated in the QD film, however, the charge carriers would be transported to the electrodes via an inefficient hopping mechanism between the QDs, which hinders the further improvement in the overall efficiency. In particular, the thicker QD film usually has a higher possibility for the charge carriers to recombine inside the film. In order to overcome this limit, it is necessary to transform the conventional planar device architecture into 3D nanostructures.7 In this case, the dramatically enhanced surface-to-volume ratio would provide a large area for collecting the charge carriers.8 The scattering effect resulting from the nanostructure would also increase the absorption efficiency of the contacted QD film without making it thick.9,10
However, the nanostructuralized surface has a large density of surface states, which would behave as the recombination centers when the charge carriers are transferred hereby. Though a series of nanostructure arrays has been proposed as the efficient electron conducting layer,11–13 the corresponding devices seem to still have a lower power conversion efficiency (PCE) than the planar counterparts. Technically, it is not easy to infiltrate the QDs into the nanostructure arrays and get a good contact between the two materials, via the conventional spin-coating procedure. Additionally, to prevent charge carrier loss at the nanostructure surface, it is also of great significance to modify the interface between the nanostructure and the electron-donor materials,14,15 to make the designed device architecture have a competent overall efficiency as we expect.
Herein, we have fabricated efficient PbS QD solar cells by completely interpenetrating PbS QDs into the TiO2 nanorod arrays, via an innovative but convenient approach. With the full optimization of the geometric parameters of TiO2 nanostructure arrays, the coverage of PbS QD top layer and the compactness of infiltrated PbS QDs, a PCE as high as 4.2% was realized. To be noted, we also purposely inserted a thin layer of CdSe QDs into the interface of TiO2 and PbS, and the device efficiency was further improved to 5.2%. Subsequent analyses of charge transfer dynamics revealed that the standard cascade type-II heterojunction of TiO2:CdSe:PbS was responsible for such a performance improvement, by facilitating the separation and transport of charge carriers.
Experimental
Fabrication of QD based solar cells
The QD based solar cells were fabricated by dropping a diluted solution with PbS QDs (4 mg mL−1) on the substrates with TiO2 nanoarrays and spin-coating at 1500 rpm after waiting for 10 s. Four drops of mercaptopropionic acid (MPA):methanol solution (10% by volume) were then cast and the substrate was spun after waiting for 5 s. The first spin-coating process of QDs was finished by three rinsing steps with methanol. This deposition process was repeated for at least three times after which a concentrated PbS QD solution (50 mg mL−1) was used instead of the diluted one. The deposition of QDs from a concentrated solution was carried out until a complete coverage of PbS QDs on the top of TiO2 nanorod arrays was formed. The resulting samples were annealed at 90 °C for 5 min in air. Afterwards, a 10 nm MoO3 layer was thermally evaporated on the top at a rate of 1 Å s−1. Finally, the device fabrication was finished by evaporating a composite anode composed of 20 nm Au and 80 nm Ag layers. A shadow mask was used to define six separated devices with a diameter of 2 mm.
The TiO2:CdSe:PbS structured device was fabricated by the same process except for the introduction of a CdSe QD layer that was prepared by the electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method. Typically, the FTO/TiO2 nanorod array substrates were immersed in 0.5 mg mL−1 CdSe QD chlorobenzene solution and a voltage of 10 V was applied for different times from 5 min to 30 min. After deposition, the samples were rinsed several times with chlorobenzene to wash off unbounded QDs. The same MPA treatment was also carried out to the deposited CdSe to replace the long surfactant. The spin-coating of PbS QDs and fabrication of solar cells were performed by the same process as that of the TiO2:PbS device. The synthetic procedures for TiO2 nanorod arrays, CdSe and PbS QDs are given in the ESI 1.†
Characterization
Morphologies of the synthesized PbS and CdSe QDs were measured using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM, JEM-2100) at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) was carried out using a JEOL-2010F TEM with an energy resolution of 1.0 eV (Gatan GIF200). The crystal structure was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Rigaku D/max-gA X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. Light absorption of solar cells was measured using a Varian Cary 5000 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy measurements were conducted on F900 lifetime spectrometers (Edinburgh Instruments, EI). Cross-sectional SEM images were obtained by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JEOL 7006F). The current–voltage characterization was carried out using a Keithley 2440 source meter and a Newport 94043A solar simulator (AM 1.5 illumination). External quantum efficiency (EQE) and photocurrent measurements were performed in a forward bias DC mode using a Crowntech Qtest Station 500ADX system. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded in the dark on a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation, by applying a 10 mV AC signal and scanning in the frequency range between 1 MHz and 100 Hz in a forward bias of 0.5 V. For the surface photovoltage spectrum (SPS) and transient SPS measurements, the samples were excited with a laser radiation pulse (wavelength of 355 nm and pulse width of 5 ns) from a third-harmonic Nd:YAG laser (Polaris II, New Wave Research, Inc.) The TPV signals were registered with a 500 MHz digital phosphor oscilloscope (TDS 5054, Tektronix).
Results and discussion
The schematic description of the device fabrication process is given in Fig. 1a, which could be divided into four steps. First, TiO2 nanorod arrays are prepared by a standard hydrothermal approach. The lengths could be modulated by the hydrothermal time while the radius is kept almost constant, thus beneficial for optimizing the device structure. Second, a thin CdSe QD layer is deposited via a typical EDP method, through which fully CdSe QD covered TiO2 nanorod arrays could be easily realized. Third, to realize a complete infiltration of PbS QDs into the nanostructures, we adopt a multi-step spin-coating procedure for depositing PbS QDs. In first several steps, the concentration of PbS in the solution is selected to be low, while in the subsequent steps the concentration is controlled to be high. After each step, a ligand exchange procedure using MPA to replace the original insulative ligand is used. Finally, by depositing MoO3 as a hole conducting layer and Ag/Au as the top electrode via a standard physical vapor deposition, the targeting QD solar cells are fabricated. Fig. 1b presents the energy band alignment for this purposely designed architecture of QD solar cells. PbS QDs have a larger energy bandgap value (1.2 eV for 4 nm PbS QDs in this work) than the bulk material (0.9 eV),16 thereby energetically allowing a cascade type-II heterojunction contact for the efficient injection of photoexcited electrons from PbS to CdSe QDs and thereafter to TiO2 nanorods.18,19 The intermediate energy band structure of CdSe QDs between TiO2 nanorods and PbS QDs is helpful for promoting the separation and transport of charge carriers to the electrode.20,21

(b) Energy level alignment of the whole device incorporating the CdSe QD interface layer. The energy level values of PbS and CdSe QDs with diameters of 4 nm and 3 nm, respectively, in our work were taken from ref. 16–18. 

Fig. 2a shows a representative SEM image of the TiO2 nanorod arrays grown for 300 min. The length of about 700 nm and diameter of about 50 nm could be clearly identified. SEM images of the nanorods with other growing time are given in Fig. S1.† Generally, with the increase of hydrothermal time from 180 min to 360 min, the length could be enlarged from 360 nm to 1200 nm while the diameter is almost unchanged. Fig. 2b exhibits the SEM image of the TiO2 nanorod array after EDP deposition of CdSe QDs. In comparison with the nanorods in Fig. 2a, these nanorods possess an obviously enlarged radial dimension, indicating the presence of CdSe on the nanorod surface. The geometric characteristics of the complete photovoltaic device are given in Fig. 2c, where a total infiltration of PbS in the nanostructure could be clearly observed. This indicates the advantages of the used procedures for fabricating efficient QD solar cells. The SEM image of the device architecture fabricated by constant spin-coating of concentrated PbS QD solution is given in Fig. S2† for reference, and a large density of cracks and holes could be observed.

The inset shows the EELS signals for Ti and Cd in the square region. (e) The corresponding EELS mapping for O (blue), Ti (red), Se (purple), and Cd (green). 
In order to get more information from the material aspect, TEM measurements were carried out and the corresponding image of the TiO2 nanorod is given in Fig. S3a,† where a bundle of nanorod arrays could be easily discerned. Fig. S3b and 3c† show the TEM images of the employed CdSe and PbS QDs, respectively. The sizes of these two materials could be gauged as 3 nm and 4 nm, respectively. In addition, XRD patterns in Fig. S3d–3f† demonstrate the phase purity of the synthesized TiO2 nanorods, CdSe and PbS QDs, respectively. Besides, we also conducted TEM measurement for the TiO2:CdSe hybrid. As shown in Fig. 2d, after EPD of CdSe for 5 min, a thin layer with a thickness of around 15 nm forms on the surface of nanorods. This thickness could be tuned by adjusting EPD time of CdSe QDs (Fig. S4†). The subsequent EELS measurements shown in the inset of Fig. 2d and e confirm that the core rod is TiO2 and the shell is CdSe.
The inset in Fig. 3a shows absorption spectra of the TiO2 nanorod array and TiO2 nanorod array:CdSe QDs, respectively. In comparison with the bare TiO2 sample, the one with the CdSe layer presents a distinct improvement in absorption capability in the visible range and a small peak located at 610 nm shows up, indicating the presence of CdSe. However, after depositing the PbS QD layer on these two structures, the difference of the spectra shown in the inset could be ignored, by showing up the main absorption feature of PbS QDs (Fig. 3a). This is attributed to the much thicker film of PbS (more than 360 nm) than the CdSe QD layer (about 15 nm). To optimize the absorption efficiency of the devices, finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations were performed and the calculated dependence of the absorption efficiency on the length of TiO2 nanorods and the thickness of CdSe thin films is shown in Fig. 3b, while a total infiltration of PbS is assumed. With the increase of the TiO2 length from 0 nm to 350 nm, the absorption efficiency of the device shows an abrupt enhancement from 0.69 to 0.87. When the length of TiO2 is increased further, the absorption efficiency reaches a plateau and the length of the nanorods becomes less influential. With regard to the thickness of CdSe QDs, which is much lower than the thickness of PbS QDs, the contribution of CdSe to the structure absorption could be ignorable, and the variation of CdSe thickness from 0 nm to 20 nm does not make any detectable changes in the absorption efficiency.

(b) FDTD simulations of the dependence of absorption efficiency on the length of TiO2 nanorods and the thickness of the CdSe thin film (c) Transient photoluminescence properties of TiO2:PbS and TiO2:CdSe:PbS substrates. 
For investigating the charge carrier transfer mechanism of the system, transient photoluminescence measurements were performed for TiO2:PbS and TiO2:CdSe:PbS, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3c, after inserting the CdSe layer into the interface of TiO2 and PbS, a promoted decaying rate could be distinctively observed, suggesting that the existence of the CdSe buffer layer inhibits the radiative recombination of the charge carriers by facilitating the charge carrier separation and transfer. By comparing the two decay spectra in detail, we could find that the two samples have almost the same decay feature in the initial stage. After that, the photoluminescence decay of TiO2:CdSe:PbS becomes faster than that of TiO2:PbS. The first stage should be probably related to the charge carrier transfer mechanism inside the PbS film. Since the two structures have the same PbS film, it is understandable to observe the same decay feature of the two spectra in the initial stage. The second stage could be possibly attributed to the presence of the CdSe layer, which promotes charge carrier transfer at the interface. This result indicates that the CdSe interface layer could be used to improve the efficiency of the relevant QD solar cells.

Fig. 4a presents photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves for the photovoltaic devices with and without the CdSe buffer layer, respectively. For the samples without CdSe thin films, the geometric parameters of the structure have been optimized and the one with the TiO2 nanorod length of 360 nm delivers the best performance: a PCE of 4.2% based on a Voc of 0.48 V, a Jsc of 18.8 mA cm−2 and a FF of 47%. The efficiency is among the highest values of the reported PbS QD based solar cells with inorganic nanorod arrays as charge carrier extractors.11,12 To be exciting, the devices with the CdSe buffer layer demonstrate a remarkable improvement in the overall efficiency, yielding a PCE of 5.2%, a Voc of 0.52 V, a Jsc of 19.8 mA cm−2 and a FF of 50%. Insufficient incorporation of CdSe QDs into the interface of TiO2 and PbS would have a lower coverage and a limited improvement in performance while excessive incorporation of CdSe QDs would not help but decrease the photovoltaic performance due to the increase in resistance, as revealed by Table S1.†Fig. 4b shows the dark J–V characteristics of the two cells with and without CdSe QDs. Compared to the TiO2:PbS device, the TiO2:CdSe:PbS solar cell generates a smaller reverse saturation current, also the “leakage” current. It is speculated that the CdSe QD intermediate layer barely influences the depletion region of PbS QDs as they have already been completely depleted when being infiltrated within a nanoporous TiO2 matrix.22 Therefore, a decreased leakage current reflects a suppressed reverse transfer of charge carriers by virtue of the cascade type-II heterojunction interface in the TiO2:CdSe:PbS cell; this is similar to the reported QD sensitized nanoporous TiO2 solar cells or core–shell shaped nanoparticle devices.23,24

The inset shows the EQE of CdSe QD sensitized TiO2 nanorod solar cell measured in the S/S2− electrolyte. (d) Dependence of the photovoltaic efficiency on the TiO2 nanorod length. The statistical data were from six devices for each structure. 
For further comparison, EQE spectra of the solar cells were monitored across the photoactive wavelength region. As shown in Fig. 4c, both of the TiO2:PbS and TiO2:CdSe:PbS samples possess a prominent EQE signal in the visible range and the profiles of the these spectra match the corresponding absorption spectra of the structures, indicating that the photon absorption by these QDs contributes to the photocurrent. In the whole scanning spectrum, the EQE of TiO2:CdSe:PbS is always higher than that of TiO2:PbS, in consistency with the results from J–V curves. To differentiate the EQE contribution of PbS QDs from CdSe QDs, CdSe QD sensitized TiO2 nanorod array solar cells were fabricated with the traditional S/S2− electrolyte, without the PbS layer. The EQE signal of the sensitized solar cell is very weak in the visible region (Fig. 4c inset) while a noticeable EQE signal appears below 400 nm, indicating that the photocurrent is mainly from the contribution of TiO2 rather than CdSe. This demonstrates that photon absorption of CdSe in the TiO2:CdSe:PbS device makes an ignorable contribution to the EQE signal, which is consistent with that shown in Fig. 3a. The signal below 400 nm of the CdSe QD sensitized device is smaller than that of the TiO2:CdSe:PbS device, thus demonstrating the advantage of the proposed device architecture. To optimize the conversion efficiencies of these devices, the length of the TiO2 nanorod was manipulated and the corresponding impact on the efficiencies is given in Fig. 4d. As the length of TiO2 increases from 360 nm to 1200 nm, both the two sets of devices exhibit a decreasing feature in the conversion efficiencies. As indicated by Fig. 3b, the increased length of nanorods beyond 350 nm does not enhance the absorption efficiencies of the devices obviously (already at the plateau), but could increase the recombination possibilities of charge carriers at the interface, by showing the intense increase in the series resistance. The devices with CdSe QDs always perform better than those without CdSe QDs, which further demonstrates the benefit of the CdSe buffer layer to performance enhancement.
In order to study the functionality of the CdSe buffer layer in detail, we carried out the measurement of the electrochemical impedance spectrum that is commonly adopted in analysing charge carrier transfer at the electron donor/acceptor contact interface.25,26Fig. 5a shows the Nyquist plots of TiO2:PbS and TiO2:CdSe:PbS hybrids measured at a forward bias voltage of 0.5 V in the frequency range of 1 MHz–100 Hz. The arc in each cell mainly corresponds to a mid-frequency response (100 KHz–100 Hz) that is correlated with the charge carrier transfer and transport process in QD based solar cells.27,28 Considering that charge carrier transfer behavior is the same at the large number of the microscopic PbS/TiO2 interfaces, we simplified this part by introducing one transfer recombination component (R2 in Fig. 5a inset) that is connected with a series resistance (Rs) and a transport resistance at the MoO3/PbS interface (R1).29,30 This equivalent circuit is also adaptable to the TiO2:CdSe:PbS cell after integrating the CdSe QDs with TiO2 nanorods into a composite unit. The derived Rs and R1 values of the TiO2:PbS cell (Rs = 40.67 Ω, R1 = 51.33 Ω) are respectively close to those of the TiO2:CdSe:PbS cell (Rs = 40.57 Ω, R1 = 58.2 Ω). However, the R2 value representing the charge carrier recombination resistance at the interface of the donor (PbS) and acceptor (TiO2 or CdSe/TiO2) is much larger in the TiO2:CdSe:PbS cell (R2 = 111.1 Ω) than that in the cell without CdSe (R2 = 62.17 Ω), thereby suggesting a lower effective recombination rate (keff) demonstrated from the peak frequency in the Bode mode plots (Fig. S5a†).15,31,32 These EIS data imply that the presence of the CdSe buffer layer is beneficial for promoting the charge transfer of the devices, particularly the electron transfer at the TiO2:PbS interface. To give a direct evidence, electron-only devices with the structure based on ITO/TiO2:PbS/LiF/Al and ITO/TiO2:CdSe:PbS/LiF/Al were fabricated and electron mobilities of the two structures were estimated according to eqn (1): (1)where ε is equal to εrε0. For TiO2, the relative permittivity εr is about 50. Veff is the effective potential drop inside the active materials. μ is the carrier mobility and L is the film thickness which is fixed to be about 400 nm for the optimized active layer. The J1/2vs. V curves are plotted and shown in Fig. 5b. Through the slopes of the two linear lines, electron mobilities of TiO2:PbS and TiO2:CdSe:PbS devices could be calculated as 5.9 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 7.7 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Obviously, the presence of CdSe promotes the electron transfer, in good agreement with the analysis on the transient photoluminescence measurements.

(b) Electron-only device with and without the CdSe QD layer. (c, d) Transient surface photovoltage spectra of TiO2:PbS and TiO2:CdSe:PbS solar cells, respectively. 
The surface photovoltage (SPV) spectrum is a useful tool for detection of charge carrier transfer and injection at the heterojunction interface.33,34 Herein, the two devices were characterized by SPV and transient SPV (TSPV) techniques. Intense SPV signals are observed in the visible light region and extend to the infrared range because of the small band gap of the synthesized PbS QDs (Fig. S5b†). Across the entire response region from 350 nm to 1000 nm, the TiO2:CdSe:PbS solar cell exhibits an enhanced SPV intensity compared to that of the TiO2:PbS solar cell, indicative of an increased number of charge carriers that can be transported to the PbS QD film surface after exciton dissociation. As to the TSPV characterization, it was reported that the one-dimensional charge diffusion model simulation can reproduce the feature well.35,36 Thus, we use the same method to simulate our TSPV experimental results. As seen from Fig. 5c and d, the response time to the photovoltage peak is about 2 × 10−5 s for the TiO2:CdSe:PbS sample while it is 3 × 10−6 s for the TiO2:PbS sample. Considering that the samples were tested at the same room temperature and the electrons diffusion coefficient is found to be similar of about 10−1 cm2 s−1, the main reason for the difference of response time is thus attributed to the electron lifetime,37 which is calculated to be 350 μs for the TiO2:CdSe:PbS solar cell, much larger than that of 25 μs for the TiO2:PbS cell. Further, compared to the reference device, our modified device exhibits a much slower SPV decay process induced by a low electron–hole reverse recombination. This also demonstrates an increased electron lifetime through the introduction of the CdSe QD interface layer. These results show that the TiO2:CdSe:PbS cascade energy level alignment is comparatively efficient in increasing the charge density, benefiting from a decreased charge carrier recombination at the cascade heterojunction interface. The stabilities of these devices are demonstrated in the ESI (Fig. S6†). With the additional encapsulating procedures, QD based solar cells could be quite promising in photovoltaic market.
Conclusion
In conclusion, efficient TiO2 nanorod array based PbS QD solar cells have been fabricated by incorporating a CdSe QD buffer layer between TiO2 and PbS. A double heterojunction with a cascade type-II energy level alignment is then formed in the modified nanobuilding blocks, which makes the solar cell less susceptible to charge carrier recombination by prolonging the lifetime and promoting the transport. Subsequently, a high energy conversion efficiency of 5.2% is realized, which is one of the highest values for the QD solar cells based on a nanostructured buffer layer. Our work provides a novel and efficient methodology of modification of the interface of PbS QD based solar cells to improve the photovoltaic performance.
