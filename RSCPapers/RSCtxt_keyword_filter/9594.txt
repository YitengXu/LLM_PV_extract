    , Accepted 23rd April 2021First published on 26th April 2021AbstractDeveloping efficient polymer donor materials to well-match with acceptors affords continuous contributions to the eminent progress of polymer solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a new series of terpolymer donors is developed by embedding electron-deficient boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) as the third monomer into the backbone of the benchmark copolymer PTB7-Th. Terpolymers afford less-rigid planarity, ascensive light-harvest ability, down-shifted HOMO levels and modified aggregation properties. Compared with copolymer PTB7-Th, synchronously improved photovoltaic performance is realized by employing terpolymers as electron donors both for fullerene and nonfullerene acceptors, with the average power conversion efficiency (PCE) enhanced from 8.78% to 9.52% for PC71BM- and from 8.79% to 10.05% for IEICO-4F-based devices, respectively. Interestingly, it is found that in terpolymer:fullerene blends, favorable light-harvesting contributes to boosted PCE. Additionally, for PSCs based on nonfullerene acceptors, improved photovoltaic performance is mainly ascribed to the modified morphology by a terpolymer approach. Our results not only confirm the advantages of BODIPY units in constructing efficient terpolymers, but also illuminate the unique virtues of the terpolymer strategy in synergistical optimization of the photovoltaic parameters to contribute to both efficient fullerene- and nonfullerene-PSCs.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) possess unique advantages of mechanical flexibility, light weight and low-cost mass production, and thus have become a promising candidate for renewable solar energy conservation.1–3 With the rapid advances in nonfullerene electron acceptors within recent years, PSCs have achieved significant developments with power conversion efficiency (PCE) beyond 17%.4–7 For bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs, matching the state-of-the-art acceptors with compatible polymer donors to ensure complementary absorbance, appropriate energy levels and favorable morphological properties is the prerequisite for realizing high photovoltaic performance. Therefore, apart from the eminent achievements in acceptor materials, the continuous developments of efficient polymer donors have synchronously contributed to the rapid progress of PSCs.8,9
Generally speaking, the design principles for efficient polymer donors mainly focus on the following considerations: (1) broadening the absorption bandwidth and enhancing the extinction coefficient to increase the photocurrent; (2) down-shifting the highest occupied molecular energy orbital (HOMO) levels to enlarge the open-circuit voltage (Voc); (3) modifying the self-aggregation properties and morphological parameters to guarantee favorable carrier dynamics.8,10 Besides designing novel building blocks to construct traditional donor–acceptor (D–A) type conjugated copolymers, developing random terpolymer donors by chemically embedding the third components into copolymer backbones provides a rational and facile approach to synchronously comply with the above strategies.11–16 Judiciously incorporating the additional copolymerizing monomer could induce favorable optoelectronic properties without sacrificing the inherent superiorities of the parental copolymers, thus maximizing the photovoltaic performance. For instance, by employing siloxane-terminated side chain-substituted benzodithiophene as the third monomer, terpolymer donors based on PTB7-Th realized enhanced PCE due to the satisfactory morphological parameters.12 In addition, involving a certain amount of ester-substituted thiophene or thiophene-thiazolothiazole into the PM6 backbone, the resulting terpolymers afforded deeper HOMO energy levels as well as optimized morphologies, contributing to improved photovoltaic performance compared to that of the parental copolymer donors.13,14
As have been mentioned above, the photovoltaic performance of PSCs is sensitive to the compatibilities between polymer donors and acceptor materials. Therefore, satisfying the requirements to match with various acceptors should be taken into account in designing terpolymer donors, while rather limited research is focused on the estimates of synchronous compatibilities of terpolymer donors in fullerene- and nonfullerene-devices. In this case, conducting a parallel comparison to explore the different contributions of the terpolymer strategy in improving photovoltaic performance of different acceptor-based PSCs is significant for in-depth understanding on the structure–property relationship of terpolymer donors. Meanwhile, the variations on optoelectronic properties of terpolymer donors are dominated by the features of the third monomer in conjugated backbones.11,17 The extra electron push–pull effects and the natural absorption characteristics of the additional fragments, resulting in varied intramolecular charge transfer transitions and regulated intermolecular interactions, could bring about individual or synergetic effects on photovoltaic properties.18,19 In other words, the selections of the third conjugated unit are the “crucial points” for terpolymer design.
In this study, for the first time, we intended to employ boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) derivative as the third monomer to construct photoactive polymers. BODIPY-based conjugated materials are famous for their unique optical properties such as high extinction coefficient, near-infrared absorbance and high photoluminescence quantum yield.20–22 In addition, the inherent electronegativity in the tetrahedral boron coordination center resulted in strong electron affinity and made BODIPY a promising electron-accepting building block.23,24 Based on the above merits, it is expected that both the light harvesting ability and electrochemical properties would be manipulated by incorporating a BODIPY unit. On the other side, taking advantage of multicomponent polymerization, the variations in polymer self-aggregation properties induced by embedding BODIPY as the third monomer, might contribute to favorable morphological parameters to further enhance device performance.25–27
Accordingly, in this work, we reported a series of BODIPY-modified terpolymer donors based on the benchmark copolymer donor PTB7-Th (poly[4,8-bis[5-(2-ethylhexyl)-2-thienyl]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophenealt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl]) (as shown in Fig. 1). PTB7-Th was selected as the parental copolymer due to its satisfactory compatibilities with fullerene acceptor PC71BM (phenyl-C71-butyricacid methyl ester) and nonfullerene acceptor IEICO-4F ((2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-(((4,4,9,9-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-4,9-dihydro-sindaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,7-diyl)bis(4-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(methanylyidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile)), thus we could evaluate the different photovoltaic performance of terpolymers when severally blending with fullerene- or nonfullerene-acceptor.28–32 To the best of our knowledge, the terpolymers in this work is the first example of employing a BODIPY derivative as the third monomer in constructing terpolymer photovoltaic materials. The as-synthesized terpolymers demonstrated enhanced extinction coefficients, wider absorption ranges and deeper HOMO energy levels compared to those of PTB7-Th. Moreover, incorporating a BODIPY unit led to the modification in polymer aggregation behaviors and further induced favorable morphologies. As a result, BODIPY-modified terpolymer donors exhibited improved device performance with the maximum PCE of 9.87% and 10.27% for PC71BM- and IEICO-4F-based PSCs, respectively, compared to 8.98% and 9.04% from PSCs based on PTB7-Th. It should be noted that the simultaneously improved photovoltaic performance for PSCs based on varied acceptors was attributed from several profits of the terpolymer donors, which indicated the multiple superiorities and satisfactory compatibilities of terpolymers. Our results demonstrated the prospect of BODIPY derivatives as promising building blocks in photoactive terpolymers. Moreover, compared to the parental copolymer, the universal and simultaneous improvements of photovoltaic parameters in both fullerene- and nonfullerene-PSCs indicate the unique superiorities of the terpolymer approach in constructing efficient polymer donors with synchronous compatibilities in varied acceptor blends.

Results and discussion
The chemical structures of the as-synthesized polymer donors, electron acceptors employed in this work and the synthetic routes for polymers are exhibited in Fig. 1. All the polymers were synthesized through a Stille coupling reaction with satisfactory yields. 8-Bis[5-(2-ethylhexyl)-2-thienyl]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT-T unit), 2-ethylhexyl-4,6-dibromo-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate (TT-F unit) and BODIPY derivative (T-4)-[3-bromo-5-[(4-bromo-3,5-dimethyl-2H-pyrrol-2-ylidene-κN)phenylmethyl]-2,4-dimethyl-1H-pyrrolato-κN]difluoroboron were employed as starting monomers. The detailed polymerization processes are provided in the ESI.† For a credible comparison, copolymer PTB7-Th was prepared parallelly. By embedding a BODIPY unit into the PTB7-Th backbone, two D–A1–D–A2 type terpolymer donors named PTB7-Th-bdp5 and PTB7-Th-bdp10 were constructed, corresponding to BODIPY molar feed ratios of 5% and 10%, relative to the BDT-T monomer, respectively. 1H NMR and 19F NMR spectra of the polymers are provided in Fig. S1–S6 (ESI†). As shown, the additional F chemical shifts and the integral areas of different F atoms confirmed that BODIPY units were successfully incorporated into PTB7-Th backbones according to the stated feed ratios resulting in BODIPY-modified terpolymers PTB7-Th-bdp5 and PTB7-Th-bdp10. In addition, molecular weights of the polymers were measured through gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using o-DCB as the eluting reagent at 120 °C, and the detailed values are listed in Table 1. Good thermal stability with satisfactory decomposition temperatures (Td) around 350 °C (Fig. S7a, ESI†) were authenticated via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Moreover, no obvious solid-state thermal transition behavior upon heating and cooling processes was observed from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements (Fig. S7b, ESI†), indicating the noncrystalline nature of the as-synthesized polymers.

To investigate the influences of the BODIPY unit on the molecular geometries and frontier molecular orbitals, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed at the B3LYP/def2svp level using the Gaussian 09 program suite. As depicted in Fig. 2, copolymer PTB7-Th presented relatively rigid planarity with small dihedral angles below 20° along the BDT-T and TT-F backbones. On the other side, for the BODIPY-modified terpolymer (simulated with a BDT-T:TT-F:BODIPY ratio of 2:1:1), relatively large dihedral angles of over 40° emerged between the BDT-T and BODIPY units. Together with the reduced coplanarity observed from the side view, terpolymers within BDT-T/BODIPY were shown to possess a more twisted backbone and the coplanarity of PTB7-Th part was also reduced through involving the BODIPY unit. It is shown that the enlarged dihedral angles and reduced coplanarity originated from the sterically hindered effect of the tetramethyl structure in the BODIPY unit. To authenticate the presumption, in Fig. S8 (ESI†), the molecular geometries of the BODIPY-modified terpolymer without tetramethyl substitution on the BODIPY unit was calculated. Furthermore, it is clearly observed that this tetramethyl-free terpolymer possessed even more planar geometries with extremely small dihedral angles below 5° between BDT-T and BODIPY. The highly coplanar backbone was not beneficial for adjusting polymer aggregate properties. Hence, it could be inferred that terpolymers would tend to form less compact intermolecular stacking with varied self-aggregation behaviors in contrast to that of PTB7-Th.33–36 In addition, as observed from the optimized orbital distributions, the HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) overlapped well and were distributed evenly across the simulated PTB7-Th backbone. Nevertheless, introducing a BODIPY monomer disturbed the distributions of molecular orbitals. More specifically, the HOMO was more delocalized in parental proportions (BDT-T-linked TT-F), while LUMO was highly concentrated on BODIPY fragments. The simulated terpolymer without tetramethyl exhibited almost the same HOMO/LUMO patterns as a terpolymer based on steric-BODIPY, indicating that the tetramethyl and sterically hindered effect had negligible influence on electron-state-density distributions. The variation in HOMO/LUMO distributions of molecular frontier orbitals indicated that the incorporation of a BODIPY unit would result in shifted energy levels for terpolymers.

In order to evaluate the different optoelectronic properties of BODIPY-modified terpolymers compared to those of PTB7-Th, the UV-vis absorption spectra and energy levels of the as-synthesized polymers were investigated. The spectra of the absorption coefficients of all the materials involved in this work are exhibited in Fig. 3a and the key parameters are summarized in Table 1. With increasing feed ratios of the BODIPY unit, the resulted terpolymers possessed gradually enhanced absorption coefficients. Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), the terpolymers have slightly wider absorption ranges with the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 161 and 170 nm for PTB7-Th-bdp5 and PTB7-Th-bdp10, compared to 155 nm of PTB7-Th. Hence, it could be concluded that by embedding the BODIPY unit through the terpolymer approach, the resulting terpolymers possessed improved light harvesting abilities, inferring that terpolymers could generate more excitons from sunlight to contribute for higher photocurrent. Moreover, it was clearly illuminated that intensities of the shoulder peaks corresponding to 0–1 vibronic transitions were gradually increased relative to 0–0 peaks by embedding the BODIPY unit.37 It is widely considered that the intensity ratios between 0–0 and 0–1 peaks (I0–0/I0–1) could be employed to estimate the aggregation degree of polymers.38–40 In contrast, the I0–0/I0–1 for terpolymers were gradually decreased upon involving BODIPY, indicating the strong aggregation of PTB7-Th was weakened by the terpolymer approach, which was in concert with the more twisted polymer backbones and less-rigid coplanarities in terpolymers as concluded from DFT calculations.

Meanwhile, in comparison between PC71BM and IEICO-4F, the former acceptor possessed a weak absorption coefficient together with a limited absorption region, while IEICO-4F exhibited high-intensity and much wider absorption range in visible and near-infrared areas (Fig. 3a). Accordingly, the absorption range and intensity of fullerene-blends were dominated by polymer donors. On the other side, IEICO-4F provided a major contribution in the absorbance of nonfullerene-blends, which was in good agreement with the profiles of the blended film absorption spectra in Fig. 3b and c. Electrochemical properties of different polymer donors were investigated through a cyclic voltammetry (CV) method (Fig. S10, ESI†). The energy level alignments of the materials and diagram of inverted device structure used in this work are depicted in Fig. 3d and e. The ELUMO demonstrated a gradually increasing trend at −3.43/−3.41/−3.40 eV for PTB7-Th/PTB7-Th-bdp5/PTB7-Th-bdp10, respectively, while for HOMO levels, deeper EHOMO values of −5.30/−5.32/−5.35 eV were obtained with BODIPY embedding, which were beneficial for achieving higher Voc in photovoltaic cells compared to that of copolymer PTB7-Th.41
In addition, to understand the different aggregation behaviors of as-synthesized polymers, the temperature-dependent UV-vis absorption spectra were measured from 15 to 120 °C with an interval of 15 °C in dilute chlorobenzene solution. According to Fig. 4a–c, by elevating the testing temperatures, gradually blue-shifted absorbance profiles together with decreased I0–0 but elevated I0–1 were observed, indicating PTB7-Th and terpolymers simultaneously possessed temperature-dependent aggregation behaviors.13,42–44 Besides, the I0–0/I0–1 values of different polymers in varied temperatures were calculated in Table S1 (ESI†) to quantitatively analyze the variance in aggregation intensities. The almost linearly diminished I0–0/I0–1 values along with elevating the testing temperatures signified that all the as-synthesized polymers presented typically J-aggregate characteristics.25,37 More specifically, among the polymers, PTB7-Th possessed the highest I0–0/I0–1 values at all the testing temperatures, followed by PTB7-Th-bdp5 and PTB7-Th-bdp10. The results indicated that PTB7-Th afforded the strongest J-aggregation tendency and the aggregation gradually weakened to provide relatively looser packing formations for terpolymers. In addition, increasing solution temperatures induced slight transformations from J-aggregates to H-aggregates ascribed to I0–0/I0–1 < 1 at high temperatures for terpolymers (especially for PTB7-Th-bdp10).39 Overall, embedding a BODIPY unit into PTB7-Th via random polymerization converted the strong J-aggregation of PTB7-Th into weak aggregate formations for terpolymers, which would result in loose intermolecular stacking and increscent spacers within polymer chains. To provide an explicit illustration, brief diagrams are provided in Fig. 4d and e according to the conclusions from DFT calculation and temperature-dependent UV-vis spectra as well as the characteristics of J-aggregation presented in the literature. Hence, it could be inferred that the less-rigid molecular coplanarity, and weakened aggregation together with loose intermolecular stacking intensity of terpolymers would jointly contribute to improved donor:acceptor contact in BHJ blends to optimize blend film morphologies.

PSCs with inverted configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/photoactive layer/MoO3/Ag were fabricated by using as-synthesized polymers as electron donors in the active layer. To evaluate the compatibilities of BODIPY-based terpolymers in both fullerene/nonfullerene PSCs, PC71BM and IEICO-4F were selected as electron acceptors, respectively. The key photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2, and the corresponding current density–voltage (J–V) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves are depicted in Fig. 5. Firstly, for devices based on PC71BM, copolymer PTB7-Th exhibited a maximum PCE of 8.98%, which was comparable to the values reported in the literature.15,28,31 By incorporating the BODIPY unit, terpolymer-based devices demonstrated gradually improved photovoltaic performances with maximum PCE values of 9.31% and 9.87%, for PTB7-Th-bdp5 and PTB7-Th-bdp10, respectively. As listed in Table 2, all the PC71BM-based devices possessed almost the same fill factor (FF) values. That meant, apart from the slightly enhanced Voc ascribed to deeper HOMO energy levels, the improved PCE values of BODIPY-containing terpolymers were mainly contributed from increased Jsc. For example, the average Jsc increased gradually from 17.68 mA cm−2 to 18.11 and 19.12 mA cm−2. In this case, the stronger extinction coefficients and broader ranges in absorption profiles for terpolymers accurately improved the light harvesting abilities and further resulted in enhanced photocurrent density. On the other side, for devices constructed by nonfullerene acceptor IEICO-4F, the terpolymers synchronously exhibited better photovoltaic performance than that of PTB7-Th. The champion PCE was obtained from the PSCs based on PTB7-Th-bdp5, with the maximum PCE of 10.27% related to Voc, Jsc and FF of 0.736 V, 21.83 mA cm−2 and 0.64, respectively. Although inferior to PTB7-Th-bdp5, the other terpolymer donor PTB7-Th-bdp10 still achieved a higher PCE of 9.58% than the value of 9.04% for the copolymer PTB7-Th. By comparison, different from the PC71BM counterparts, relatively similar Jsc values obtained from IEICO-4F-based PSCs indicated that the improvement in light-harvesting ability afforded limited contribution in IEICO-4F blends. The results were in good correspondence with the discussions in the section on blend absorption in that the contributions afforded by polymer donors in the active layers were different in fullerene and nonfullerene blends.45 For PC71BM-based blends, the absorbance was mainly undertaken by polymer donors. However, IEICO-4F afforded most light-harvesting in blended films because of its higher absorption coefficient and broader absorption range. Besides on the enhanced Voc, the better photovoltaic performance of terpolymer donors in nonfullerene blends synchronously benefited from improved FF, which may be related to the regulated self-aggregation behaviors, and thus further guaranteeing efficient charge dynamics in terpolymer-based blends. The different photoresponse intensities in EQE curves of PC71BM- or IEICO-4F-based PSCs (Fig. 5c and d) were also in accordance with the variance in Jsc values.

Therefore, to confirm the above suppositions, a combination of characterizations was employed upon fullerene- and nonfullerene-based PSCs to investigate the influences on charge dynamics of involving the BODIPY unit. First of all, photocurrent density (Jph) was plotted as a function of the effective voltage (Veff). As shown in Fig. 6a and d, determined from the current density under the short-circuit and saturated outputting conditions, the exciton dissociation probabilities P(E,T) for PTB7-Th, PTB7-Th-bdp5 and PTB7-Th-bdp10 were calculated as 95.13%/96.48%/96.92% and 89.78%/95.51%/93.62% for PSCs based on PC71BM and IEICO-4F, respectively. In contrast to similar values from PC71BM-based devices, the higher P(E,T) values of terpolymer-based devices in nonfullerene configuration indicated that more efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection were realized by the terpolymer approach, thus affording the improvement on FF in corresponding terpolymer devices.46–48 Moreover, the maximum exciton generation rates Gmax were calculated. As summarized in Table 3, in the fullerene system, Gmax gradually enhanced at 7.48 × 1027, 8.30 × 1027 and 9.26 × 1027 m−3 s−1 for PTB7-Th, PTB7-Th-bdp5 and PTB7-Th-bdp10, respectively. The higher Gmax values were in accordance with the enhanced Jsc values, further proving that terpolymers were accurately favorable for capturing more photons. Nevertheless, since the polymer donors were no longer the dominant absorber in IEICO-4F blends, the Gmax values for relevant devices became closer to relatively similar values of 1.03 × 1028, 1.05 × 1028 and 1.03 × 1028 m−3 s−1, which was in consistence with the similar Jsc values in IEICO-4F-based devices.

In addition, the biomolecular charge recombination processes for different PSCs were investigated via studying the dependence of Jsc upon light intensity (Plight). It has been widely reported that a linear correlation of Jsc on Plight with α value close to 1 implies negligible bimolecular recombination in PSCs.49,50 As depicted (Fig. 6b and e), the α values of PC71BM devices were determined to be 0.98, 1.00 and 1.00 for PTB7-Th, PTB7-Th-bdp5 and PTB7-Th-bdp10, respectively. On the other side, the slopes for Jsc–Plight were 0.98, 1.01 and 1.00, respectively for PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F, PTB7-Th-bdp5:IEICO-4F and PTB7-Th-bdp10:IEICO-4F. Hence, it could be concluded that bimolecular recombination was almost completely suppressed in terpolymer-based devices for both fullerene and non-fullerene systems.
Moreover, by utilizing the space charge limited current (SCLC) method, the charge transport abilities of both neat films and the corresponding blend films were measured (Fig. S11–S13, ESI†). The detailed values are summarized in Table 3, and the variation tendencies of hole mobilities (μh) and electron mobilities (μe) are depicted in Fig. 6c and f. Due to weaker self-aggregation and incompact packing, involving BODIPY into PTB7-Th resulted in gradually reduced μh, with values of 4.49 × 10−4, 3.50 × 10−4 and 2.35 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PTB7-Th, PTB7-Th-bdp5 and PTB7-Th-bdp10 neat films, respectively. As for different blended films, the terpolymer blends still possessed lower μh than that of PTB7-Th. However, in both fullerene and nonfullerene blends, μe was gradually enhanced for terpolymers thus resulting in more balanced charge transportation (μh:μe) (Fig. 6c and f). The modified aggregate states by the terpolymer approach were responsible for the gradually enhanced μe.51,52 It is explained that weak aggregation and relatively loose intermolecular stacking of terpolymers particularly with higher feed ratio of steric-BODIPY contents would facilitate to form expansive spacers to accommodate more pure acceptor domains. In this case, larger-scale pure acceptor domains would be generated to provide sufficient electron pathways. Therefore, ascribed to promoted μe, more balanced hole and electron transport was achieved in terpolymer-based blends to guarantee increased FF of the corresponding PSCs.
In order to further illuminate the relationships of varied aggregation intensities with donor:acceptor (D:A) contact, miscibility between donors (D) and acceptors (A), which drives the D:A phase separation was characterized through contact angle measurements. The images of contact angles of different neat films upon redistilled water and diiodomethane are expressed in Fig. 7 and Fig. S14 (ESI†). The detailed parameters of surface free energies were calculated by the Owens–Wendt model (Table S2, ESI†).53,54 With embedding the BODIPY unit into the PTB7-Th backbone, dispersion forces (γd) were gradually enhanced thus resulting in increased surface free energies (γ) of 32.61 and 33.59 mJ m−2 for PTB7-Th-bdp5 and PTB7-Th-bdp10, respectively, compared to 31.36 mJ m−2 for PTB7-Th. Furthermore, Flory–Huggins interaction parameters were calculated using the formula χ = k(γdonor1/2 − γacceptor1/2)2, where χ is the interaction parameter between the polymer donor and polymer acceptor, k is a constant, and γdonor and γacceptor represent the surface free energies of the donor and acceptor surfaces, respectively. For blended films, higher χ values indicated poorer miscibility between donors and acceptors, which further resulted in large-scale phase separation.12,55 In both fullerene and nonfullerene blends, the χ values gradually decreased from PTB7-Th to PTB7-Th-bdp5 and PTB7-Th-bdp10, with specific values of 1.71/1.43/1.23 in PC71BM blends and 0.53/0.38/0.28 in IEICO-4F blends, respectively. Compared to PTB7-Th, the decreased χ values showed that the miscibility between terpolymer donors and acceptors were improved, which might be of benefit for tightening the D:A contact and shrinking the phase separation. The results from contact angle measurements were also in correspondence to the conclusions from DFT calculations and temperature-dependent UV-vis absorption spectra. That is the incompact interpolymer stacking and weak polymer aggregation were achieved by embedding the BODIPY unit. Good miscibility would further induce well-intermixed blend morphology and favorable phase distribution between terpolymer donors and acceptors, which were also in good agreement with more balanced μh:μe in terpolymer-based blends.

Furthermore, the surface morphologies of the photoactive layers were investigated via atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. S15 (ESI†), all the as-synthesized polymers demonstrated similar amorphous morphologies. The gradually decreased root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.86/0.78/0.74 nm were obtained for PTB7-Th/PTB7-Th-bdp5/PTB7-Th-bdp10 surfaces by embedding the BODIPY unit. In addition, the AFM images for different blends are demonstrated in Fig. 8. For PC71BM-based blends, because of the noncrystalline nature of both the polymer donors and PC71BM, their blended films were relatively smoother compared to the blends comprising crystallized IEICO-4F. As observed in the phase images, the fiber-like microstructures belonged to the aggregation of polymer donors.56,57 These fibers could contribute to form continuous nanonetworks, further restricting the self-assembly of a pure acceptor to serve as the “phase distribution lock” to determine the phase distribution and separation.58,59 Massive fibers in the blended films based on PTB7-Th indicated that the strong aggregation of copolymer dominated the morphologies. While for terpolymer-based blends, because of the less-compact self-aggregation behaviors of terpolymers compared to those of PTB7-Th, the restricting effects upon acceptors were weakened, thus the accumulation of acceptor domains were more pronounced in BHJ photoactive layers. Hence, in all the terpolymer-based blends, compared to the copolymer, the nanofibers were gradually inconspicuous due to the suppressed polymer stacking and improved miscibility between terpolymers and acceptors.60–62 Especially for the PTB7-Th-bdp10:IEICO-4F blended film (Fig. 8b), the crystallized IEICO-4F dominated the morphology with the coarser surface almost covered up by the crystalline structure other than that of the polymer fiber. The promoted aggregation of acceptors was potentially favorable for improving domain purity of pure acceptors, which provided credible illustration for higher μe in terpolymer blends. Furthermore, moderate polymer stacking and appropriate miscibility might contribute to more sufficient donor:acceptor contact and proper phase separation, which were beneficial for promoting exciton dissociation and suppressing charge recombination.

Conclusions
In summary, for the first time, a BODIPY derivative was employed as a reacting monomer to construct terpolymer donors. Utilizing the superior optoelectronic properties of BODIPY, terpolymers afforded advanced light-harvest ability and down-shifted HOMO levels in contrast to parental copolymer PTB7-Th. Moreover, the rigid planarity and intense aggregation were relieved by involving steric BODIPY, which provided potential approaches to optimize morphological parameters. PC71BM and IEICO-4F were successively employed as acceptor materials to evaluate photovoltaic performance. Terpolymers exhibited satisfactory compatibilities in both fullerene/nonfullerene blends with improved PCE of 9.87%/10.27% compared to 8.98%/9.04% from PSCs based on PTB7-Th, respectively. The improvement in photovoltaic performance originated from diverse superiorities of terpolymers compared with those of copolymer PTB7-Th; for example, the synchronously enhanced Voc in both fullerene and nonfullerene systems was ascribed to deeper HOMO levels, the ascensive light-harvesting capability contributed to enlarged Jsc for BODIPY containing terpolymers in fullerene blends, and an improved FF for nonfullerene system was attributed to optimized blend morphologies from modest terpolymer aggregations. Our results indicated that BODIPY derivatives were effective building blocks in constructing efficient photoactive polymers. Moreover, the synchronous improvements in both fullerene- and nonfullerene-PSCs by employing BODIPY-modified terpolymers highlighted the advantages of the terpolymer approach in fine-tuning the optoelectronic properties and optimizing morphologies to further facilitate continuous progress in PSCs.
