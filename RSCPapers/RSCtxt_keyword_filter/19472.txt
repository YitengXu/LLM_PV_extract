    , Accepted 12th January 2012First published on 16th January 2012AbstractQuaternary tetragonal Cu2FeSnS4 nanocrystals have been synthesized by a simple hot-injection method. Detailed characterizations have been made. A suitable optical band gap of 1.28 ± 0.02 eV and a notable and stable photoelectrochemical response indicate their potential for application in solar cells.
To deal with the increasingly severe energy crisis, research on high-efficient and low-cost solar cells is of pressing need and of great significance. Among many different types of solar cells, the CuInxGa1−xSeyS1−y (CIGSS) thin film solar cell has attracted tremendous attention owing to its high power conversion efficiency (20.3%) and good stability.1 However, the scarcity of indium and gallium acts as a barrier for large scale production of CIGSS thin film solar cells. For years, scientists have been trying to find a chalcogenide which consisted of only earth-abundant elements and retain the similar structure to CIGSS.2 Theoretical calculations have demonstrated that the presence of tetrahedrally coordinated copper atoms is a critical feature for the exhibition of good photovoltaic properties of chalcogenide absorbers.3 Hence, a class of quaternary chalcogenides including Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) and Cu2FeSnS4 receives more attention due to analogous crystal structure to CIGSS and earth-abundant composition.4 The reported conversion efficiency of CZTS-based solar cells has reached 9.6%,5 promoting the research on CZTS.6 However the investigation on Cu2FeSnS4, another possible earth-abundant alternative to CIGSS, for solar cell application remains rare.7
Recently, a new approach has emerged for large-scale fabrication of solar cells based on the synthesis of nanocrystals that can be either annealed into large-grain thin films for the 2nd generation solar cells or used to fabricate into nanocrystal arrays for the 3rd generation solar cells. This approach enables lower fabrication cost than the traditional physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique and/or leads to high efficiency that benefits from the advancement in colloidal hot-injection synthesizing high-quality nanocrystals.8 Numerous photovoltaic nanocrystals such as CuInSe2 and its related compounds,9Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2(ZnSn1−xGex)(SySe1−y)410 have been synthesized using a hot-injection based method. Here we first report the synthesis of Cu2FeSnS4 nanocrystals by the hot-injection method, which plays a key role in the fabrication of both nanocrystal-inks and nanocrystal arrays.11 The growth process was studied preliminarily and the intermediates were identified. The band gap of the tetragonal Cu2FeSnS4 was measured as 1.28 ± 0.02 eV. These nanocrystals can be easily dispersed in relatively low-toxic solvents and well fabricated into Cu2FeSnS4 films by drop-casting. The obtained film has a clear and stable photoelectrochemical response. Our studies demonstrate that Cu2FeSnS4 has potential in the application of solar cell devices.

        Cu2FeSnS4
nanocrystals are synthesized by injecting a solution of elemental sulfur in oleylamine (OLA) into an oleylamine solution containing 1.5 mmol copper(II) acetylacetonate (Cu(acac)2), 0.5 mmol iron(II) acetylacetonate (Fe(acac)2), and 0.75 mmol of tin(II) chloride (SnCl2) at 280 °C (experimental details are included in ESI†). Fig. 1 demonstrates transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of representative nanocrystals synthesized for 1 h. Fig. 1a shows the low-magnification TEM of triangular and round Cu2FeSnS4 nanocrystals with an average diameter of 13.2 ± 1.1 nm. The corresponding size distribution plot is given as an inset to Fig. 1a. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) (Fig. 1b) illustrates that the nanocrystals possess crystalline surface and lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 3.2 Å that can be ascribed to the (111) plane of tetragonal Cu2FeSnS4. The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern presented in Fig. 1c matches with the structure of tetragonal Cu2FeSnS4 (JCPDS 70-4373), as indicated via the diffraction spots corresponding to the (111), (202), (311) and (331) planes.

The structure and composition of the Cu2FeSnS4 nanocrystals were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Fig. 2) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, Fig. S1 in ESI†). Cu2FeSnS4 is a tetrahedrally coordinated semiconductor in which each sulfur anion is bonded to four cations and each cation is bonded to four sulfur anions as shown in the inset of Fig. 2. The cation layers alternate with sulfur anion layers along the crystallographic c-direction as CuCu/SS/FeSn/SS. It should be noted that this ordering resembles the chalcopyrite CuInS2 with cation and anion layers alternating as CuIn/SS/CuIn/SS and stannite CZTS as CuCu/SS/ZnSn/SS.10a These structural features of tetragonal Cu2FeSnS4 suggest good photovoltaic properties.3 The XRD pattern exhibits three broad peaks at 2θ = 28.5°, 47.4°, and 56.3°, which are assigned to the (111), (202), and (311) planes of the tetragonal Cu2FeSnS4 crystals (JCPDS 70-4373), respectively, consistent with SAED data. The three main peaks in the XRD pattern demonstrate wide full-width at half-maxima (FWHM) owing to the broadening effect of nanometre size of the Cu2FeSnS4 nanocrystals. However, the XRD pattern matches well simultaneously with that of Cu2SnS3 (JCPDS 27-0198) and FeS (JCPDS 23-1123). The composition of the Cu2FeSnS4 nanocrystals is determined by EDS to be Cu2Fe1.05Sn1.06S4.69, which is slightly sulfur-rich.

To eliminate the possibility that the sample was a coincidental stoichiometric mixture of Cu2SnS3 and FeS phases, Raman characterization of the nanocrystals was performed (see Fig. S2, ESI†). The existence of Cu2FeSnS4 is confirmed by the peaks at 213 cm−1, 276 cm−1, 392 cm−1 and 320 cm−1, which are in good agreement with the values reported for tetragonal Cu2FeSnS4.12 According to Raman data, no FeS (peaks at 492 cm−1 and 293 cm−1)13 and Cu2SnS3 phases (peaks at 336 cm−1 and 351 cm−1)14 were found, demonstrating that the synthesized nanocrystals are Cu2FeSnS4 rather than FeS, Cu2SnS3, or the mixture of FeS and Cu2SnS3.
To study the growth mechanism of the Cu2FeSnS4 nanocrystals, the morphology and structure of the reaction products at different reaction times were investigated by TEM and XRD, as illustrated in Fig. S3 and S4 (included in ESI†). In the initial stage (1 min), an amorphous material surrounded by some nanocrystals was observed, indicating that the nanocrystal may nucleate from the amorphous matrix (similar amorphous matrices were also observed in a previous report on pyrite nanocrystal synthesis15). Most of the initially formed nanocrystals are CuS rather than Cu2FeSnS4 according to XRD data. Similarly, CuSe phase also first formed in the synthesis process of CuInSe2via a hot-injection method in oleylamine.16 With the reaction time of 4 min, the amorphous materials were consumed, forming nanocrystals. The peaks in the corresponding XRD spectrum suggest that the products mainly consist of CuS, CuFeS2 and Cu2FeSnS4. After 15 min, the peaks assigned to CuS and CuFeS2 disappeared, and the remaining peaks can be indexed to tetragonal Cu2FeSnS4. From the results above, CuS and CuFeS2 are confirmed to be the intermediates in the synthesis of Cu2FeSnS4 nanocrystals. Therefore, a possible formation route can be conjectured as follows: CuS forms first, which then reacts with Fe(acac)2-OLA, leading to the formation of CuFeS2. By reactions between the intermediates and Sn species, Cu2FeSnS4 is produced. When the reaction time reaches 1.5 h, large and aggregated nanocrystals were observed that may be due to the Ostwald ripening.17
The absorption spectrum of the as-synthesized Cu2FeSnS4 nanocrystals is measured using UV-vis-NIR absorbance spectroscopy (Fig. 3), which presents a slow, monotonic absorption rise. The band gap of the Cu2FeSnS4 nanocrystals is estimated to be 1.28 ± 0.02 eV by extrapolating the linear region of the plot of the absorbance squared versus energy as shown in the inset of Fig. 3. The obtained band gap value of Cu2FeSnS4 nanocrystals is close to the optimal value for solar cell application.18 Additionally, the band gap of Cu2SnS3 is 0.93 eV,19 providing another evidence that this phase is not present.

In order to further evaluate the prospect of using the Cu2FeSnS4 nanocrystal-ink coating film as the active layer in photovoltaic applications, photoelectrochemical characterization was carried out. The Cu2FeSnS4 nanocrystal-ink is coated directly onto an ITO glass which served as electrodes by drop-casting to form nanocrystal thin films. Then the nanocrystal films were annealed at 350 °C in an Ar atmosphere for 1 hour to remove the ligands and to improve the conductivity of the Cu2FeSnS4 film.20Fig. 4 displays the photocurrent–potential curve of a photoelectrochemical test of the obtained Cu2FeSnS4 thin film in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. It is shown that an onset of photocurrent is at 0.1 V vs.SCE, and the photocurrent densities increase with a negative shift of the cathodic potential, indicating the Cu2FeSnS4 film of p-type semiconductor.21 The photocurrent density reaches a saturated value at potentials between −0.3 V and −0.5 V vs.SCE. The transient I–Vspectrum at −0.4 V vs.SCE is shown in the inset of Fig. 4. Upon illumination of the Cu2FeSnS4 electrode, the current density is observed to quickly increase and remain relatively constant (here 10 s), and upon switching off the light, the current density returns to its preillumination value. This photocurrent response profile is reproducible over many cycles (only 11 cycles demonstrated here) without significant photocurrent decay, showing a relatively good photostability. The photocurrent values are between 11 and 13 μA cm−2. The notable generation of photocurrent and its stability indicate the potential use of tetragonal Cu2FeSnS4 in solar energy conversion systems, such as the solar cell.10b,20

In summary, we have first presented the synthesis of homogeneous, well dispersed tetragonal Cu2FeSnS4 nanocrystals by using a hot-injection method. Its structure was confirmed by SAED, HRTEM, XRD and Raman. A possible formation route was proposed from the evolution of morphologies and phases. The band gap of 1.28 ± 0.02 eV for the synthesized Cu2FeSnS4 nanocrystals was determined from UV-vis-NIR data. The preliminary photoelectrochemical characterizations indicate that the Cu2FeSnS4 films have p-type conductivity, clear photoelectrochemical response and good photostability. Values of the photocurrent density for this system, without attempts to optimize, in the range of 11 and 13 μA cm−2 were obtained. This work demonstrates that tetragonal Cu2FeSnS4 is a promising semiconductor for photovoltaic application.
