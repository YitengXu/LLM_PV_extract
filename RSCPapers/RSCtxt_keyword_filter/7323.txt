    , Accepted 19th July 2013First published on 22nd July 2013AbstractWe successfully demonstrate a smart strategy to use aluminum doped ZnO (AZO) and the thiophene-based conjugated polyelectrolyte P3TMAHT as an interfacial layer in small molecule solution-processed inverted solar cells. Modification of AZO with a thin P3TMAHT layer increases the photovoltaic properties of the inverted cell as a result of reduction in the work function of the cathode with well aligned frontier orbital energy levels for efficient charge transport and reduced surface recombination. The inverted device achieved ∼16% performance improvement dominantly by recapturing part of the Voc losses when going from conventional to the inverted architecture. In addition, the inverted device using the AZO/P3TMAHT interlayer shows improved device stability in air compared to conventional devices.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) using small molecules have attracted extensive attention due to their potential for well-defined molecular structure, easy purification, easy mass-scale production, high charge carrier mobility, and better batch-to-batch reproducibility.1–4 In the last year, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solution-processed small molecule (SM) OSCs exceeding 7% was published,5,6 making them promising and competitive with polymer-based BHJ solar cells. Though impressive, these devices were prepared and characterized as a conventional structure, using low work-function cathodes (e.g. Ca or Al) for collecting the electrons.5–7 Consequently these devices suffer from poor air stability, low operational lifetime and thus require proper encapsulation to prevent degradation under oxygen and moisture.8–10 To overcome conventional devices and stability issues, more effort should be focused on the inverted architecture with stable high work function metal contacts (e.g. Ag) as anodes. In addition, the inverted architecture is known to be better compatible for production via printing processes.9,11–13
Interface engineering plays a key role in the formation of charge selective interfaces and is critical to the whole device performance and stability. However, it was difficult to investigate interface engineering in small molecule inverted solar cells due to two significant reasons. On the one hand, highly acidic poly(3,4-ethyl-enedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) used as the electron blocking layer and hole selective layer at the anode side resulted in decomposition of small molecules and hindered the selection of an electron transporting layer.12 Recently, molybdenum sub-oxides (MoOx) with high work functions (WFs), deposited by vacuum deposition, were demonstrated as promising alternatives to PEDOT:PSS.11–13 On the other hand, although various stable low WF metal oxides, such as TiOx and ZnO, as the electron extraction layer in the cathode side have been widely applied for polymeric solar cells (PSCs) to improve the photovoltaic properties of devices,14–18 some metal-oxide-based devices have intrinsic limitations including incomplete ligand removal, unbalanced charge carrier injection and transport, or inefficient electron–hole recombination, which result in poor control of the electronic surface properties, high contact resistance or surface recombination.19–21 The aforementioned shortcomings lead to a low fill factor (FF), low open circuit voltage (Voc) and therefore low power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices. In particular, this effect is observed in small molecule inverted solar cells. For example, Heeger and coworkers reported ITO/ZnO/PEIE/(p-DTS(FBTTh2)2):PC70BM/MoO3/Ag inverted solar cells.11 To optimize the inverted structure, they introduced polyethylenimine, 80% ethoxylated (PEIE), on the top of ZnO to lower the work function of ZnO, and increase the Voc (from 0.72 to 0.77 V) and PCE of devices (from 6.29% to 7.88%). However, this electron transporting ZnO required a low thickness and high-temperature (200 °C for 1 h) thermal annealing to crystallize the amorphous film. Therefore, these results drove us to pay close attention to the interface engineering and look for novel electron transporting layer and interfacial layer materials for various small molecule-based inverted device applications.
An optimized interfacial layer should have air stability, non-toxicity, and the ability to effectively influence the work function of adjacent electrodes or transport layers. In addition, it should be able to properly balance charge transport, reduce the interfacial contact resistance and prevent surface recombination.8,22–25 Recently, conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs), which are conjugated polymers with ionic functionalities, were introduced as promising interfacial materials in PSCs.22–26 For instance, polyfluorene-based CPE interlayers were incorporated into a thieno[3,4-b]-thiophene/benzodithiophene copolymer (PTB7)-based PSC and a high PCE of 9.2% was achieved.25 Bazan et al. demonstrated a homopolymer poly[3-(6-trimethylammoniumhexyl)thiophene] (P3TMAHT) in a poly[N-9′′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT) based conventional solar cell with a polythiophene-type electron extracting CPE interlayer (poly[3-(6-trimethylammoniumhexyl)thiophene] P3TMAHT) which could improve the device performance (PCE) from 5.0 to 6.1%.22 Afterwards, Yang et al. incorporated interlayers composed of a blend of P3TMAHT and sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDS) as a surfactant into poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)- or PTB7-based PSCs, with the interlayers adjacent to the Al electrode.23 The P3TMAHT/SDS polyelectrolyte/surfactant complex, details mentioned in ref. 27, was shown to be compatible with various material combinations within the active layer, and improves the device performance and device stability in air. Although already used in polymer-based inverted solar cells,28 polythiophene-based CPE interlayers have not been employed so far in small molecule-based inverted solar cells for optimizing the device performance.
In this work, we constructed efficient small molecule inverted solar cells by employing a combination of aluminum doped ZnO (AZO) and a conjugated P3TMAHT as an electron transporting layer (see Fig. 1a), and using a blend of star-shaped molecule tris{4-[5′′-(1,1-dicyanobut-1-en-2-yl)-2,2′-bithiophen-5-yl]phenyl}amine (N(Ph-2T-DCN-Et)3) and 6,6-phenyl-C70-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) as an active layer, as shown in ref. 29. The AZO layer was introduced as an interfacial layer because it not only overcomes the conductivity and film thickness restriction of intrinsic metal oxide layers,19 but is also processed at a relatively low temperature of 140 °C for 10 min. In addition, a P3TMAHT-based CPE interlayer enhanced electron injection and transport at the cathode by lowering the work function of AZO and further reduced the inherent incompatibility between the AZO layer and the organic active layer.

(b) Schematic energy level diagrams for flat band conditions at the AZO/(P3TMAHT)/active layer junction with and without the P3TMAHT layer. 
The device structure, the molecular structures of N(Ph-2T-DCN-Et)3 and P3TMAHT, and the energy levels of the components used in the devices are shown in Fig. 1a and b. Details of the methods for the synthesis of N(Ph-2T-DCN-Et)3 and P3TMAHT are described in the literature.29,30 The AZO layer was prepared by doctor-blading the AZO precursor solution on a pre-cleaned ITO electrode; later conversion of the precursor to AZO via hydrolysis was achieved by heating the samples to 140 °C for 10 min. The work function of AZO characterized by Kelvin probe microscopy is approximately 4.2 eV, which is close to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of PC70BM (4.3 eV) and thus it benefits electron transport to ITO. In the following, the P3TMAHT layers were deposited by doctor-blading from 0.1% P3TMAHT (w/v) solutions in methanol. The work function of AZO reduced to 3.82 eV after deposition of a thin layer of P3TMAHT. Indeed, the increased polarity due to the accumulation of ions and the formation of a dipole layer at the interface of AZO is observed as described in ref. 22 and 25; preparative details are described in the Experimental section. Although the absorption onset wavelength (λonset) of pristine P3TMAHT films is ∼593 nm,23 AZO covered with the very thin P3TMAHT layer is highly transparent in the visible range as shown in Fig. S1,† and this will be of benefit to light harvesting.

Fig. 2 shows the surface morphologies obtained by atomic force microscopy (AFM), as measured in an inert nitrogen atmosphere. The AZO film is composed of nano-sized particles with a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 3.3 nm, as shown in Fig. 2a. A 30 nm thick P3TMAHT layer showed a relatively smooth and homogenous surface (RMS roughness = 1.19 nm, Fig. 2b). A thin P3TMAHT layer on AZO is only slightly smoother than pristine AZO (RMS roughness decreases to 2.82 nm, as shown in Fig. 3c). The RMS roughness of a N(Ph-2T-DCN-Et)3:PC70BM BHJ film is only 0.31 nm.

The current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of N(Ph-2T-DCN-Et)3:PC70BM-based conventional (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/N(Ph-2T-DCN-Et)3:PC70BM/Ca/Ag) and inverted devices (ITO/AZO/(P3TMAHT)/N(Ph-2T-DCN-Et)3:PC70BM/MoO3/Ag) under simulated AM 1.5 and in the dark are shown in Fig. 3a and b, respectively. Device parameters are deduced from the J–V characteristics in the light and dark (summarized in Table 1). The reference conventional cells based on N(Ph-2T-DCN-Et)3:PC70BM as an active layer have a Voc of 0.939 V, a Jsc of 7.79 mA cm−2, a FF of 45.9% and a PCE of 3.36%, while the series resistance (Rs) is 1.29 Ω cm2 and the parallel resistance (Rsh) is 1.84 kΩ cm2. In contrast, the inverted cells based on AZO as an electron transporting layer show a PCE of 3.17% with a Voc of 0.840 V, a Jsc of 8.47 mA cm−2, and a FF of 44.5%. Compared with the conventional device, the increased Jsc of the inverted device could be attributed to the enhanced light reflection and spatial electric field redistribution in the device, and thus increase light collection.18 The slightly decreased FF of the inverted device could result from the decrease in parallel resistance (from 1.84 to 0.85 kΩ cm2). The surface recombination, work function mismatch or interface barrier might result in a reduced leakage current density. However, the Voc of the inverted devices decreased significantly from 0.939 to 0.840 V, and thus resulted in a slightly low PCE of 3.17%. Consequently, we introduced P3TMAHT as an interfacial layer on the AZO layer to reduce the work function of the AZO. The work function of AZO decreased from 4.2 eV to 3.82 eV after depositing the P3TMAHT layer, which facilitates electron injection and transport by reducing the energy barrier between the transparent cathode and the active layer. This directly resulted in an increased Voc (from 0.840 to 0.898 V). In addition, compared with the AZO based inverted device, the combination of AZO and P3TMAHT layer slightly enhanced Jsc (from 8.47 to 8.85 mA cm−2) and FF (from 44.5% to 49.2%), and thus resulted in a higher PCE of 3.91%. This best PCE value increased by 16% in comparison with that of the conventional device (3.36%) under the same experimental conditions. The Rs reduces to 0.96 Ω cm2 and Rsh increases to 2.34 kΩ cm2, which explains the better FF (the average FF value is ca. 46%) compared to the conventional device. Considering the improvement of Jsc, Heeger et al. speculated that the increased built-in potential and internal electric field might facilitate the charge carriers to escape shallow traps and reduce trap-assisted recombination.11 Kim et al. concluded that the smoother and more hydrophobic surface of the polyelectrolyte-based buffer layer (in our case the P3TMAHT interlayer on top of the AZO layer, as shown in Fig. 2c) improves the compatibility between the organic active layer and AZO and that the improved contact may induce an enhanced Jsc.8 In addition, the photovoltaic properties of devices with a structure of ITO/P3TMAHT/N(Ph-2T-DCN-Et)3:PC70BM/MoO3/Ag were significantly worse than those in previous trials, as shown in Fig. S2.† It is probably due to the major limitation of using a thin film of P3TMAHT which may result in poor electrical contact with the ITO.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of various devices are shown in Fig. 3c. The EQE results are in agreement with the Jsc of various devices mentioned above. The improved PCE of the device with the AZO/P3TMAHT layer is also consistent with the higher EQE value (>55%) exhibited in the PC70BM absorption region between 350 and 500 nm. Although the absorption spectra of blends on AZO and AZO/P3TMAHT layers are similar as shown in Fig. 3c, the higher EQE values of the AZO/P3TMAHT layer based device in the PC70BM absorption region prove that AZO/P3TMAHT extracts electrons more efficiently from PC70BM, and thus successfully reduces the recombination.
Besides the device efficiency improvement, an enhanced device stability was observed as expected when the inverted structure with the AZO/P3TMAHT layer was used. Fig. 4a shows the efficiency versus storage time in air of the conventional and inverted devices without any encapsulation. The conventional cells were fabricated using the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BHJ/Ca/Ag structure as mentioned before.29 Due to the high reactivity of Ca with oxygen and moisture, the conventional device was completely degraded and showed no photovoltaic activity after 15 days in air, whereas the inverted device with the AZO/P3TMAHT layer maintained more or less 70% of its initial PCE. The J–V characteristics of the conventional and inverted cells as a function of storage time in ambient air are shown in Fig. S3 and S4 (ESI).† The changes in normalized Jsc, Voc and FF over the period of storage in air are shown in Fig. 4b. Both Voc and FF of the conventional device remained almost unchanged during the air exposure test. The decay is mainly found in a drop of Jsc due to the instability of Ca (as shown in Fig. 4b). In addition, the water-soluble side groups of P3TMAHT may also be sensitive to moisture,23 which resulted in a rather slow degradation of Voc and Jsc after 10 days. The degradation mechanism of small molecule inverted solar cells will be investigated in more detail in the near future. Nevertheless, the replacement of the conventional device by an inverted architecture based on AZO/P3TMAHT leads to a substantially improved device lifetime, while the ease of manufacturing via printing processes is maintained.

In conclusion, we investigated the effect of P3TMAHT modified AZO interfaces on the performance and stability of small molecule solution-processed inverted solar cells using N(Ph-2T-DCN-Et)3:PC70BM as the active layer. By modifying AZO with a thin P3TMAHT-based CPE interlayer, the PCE of the inverted device with the AZO/P3TMAHT layer is increased by 16% in comparison with that (3.36%) of the conventional device under the same experimental conditions. The high PCE (3.91%) of the inverted device is benefited from the reduction of the work function of the AZO and ease of extraction of electrons from the inherently incompatible hydrophilic metal oxide and hydrophobic active layers. In addition, the inverted device using the AZO/P3TMAHT couple improved the device stability in air compared to conventional devices. Therefore, CPE interlayers (such as P3TMAHT) are an excellent choice for improving the electron extracting properties in small molecule-based inverted solar cells.
Experimental section
Synthesis of Al doped ZnO
Al doped zinc oxide (EEL):Zn(OAc)2·2H2O (20 g), Al(OH)(OAc)2 (0.3 g) and Zonyl FSO-100 (0.6 g) were mixed in demineralized water (200 mL). The mixture was stirred for 2 h and filtered through a 0.45 micrometer filter to remove the insoluble material.
Inverted architecture devices
The inverted photovoltaic devices were processed and characterized in ambient atmosphere. Pre-structured ITO coated glass substrates (as obtained from Osram) were subsequently cleaned in acetone and isopropyl alcohol for 10 min each. After drying, the substrates were coated with the AZO solution via doctor blading. The AZO precursor was synthesized as optimized and reported earlier based on zinc acetate and aluminum nitrate in ethanol.31 Conversion of the precursor to AZO via hydrolysis was achieved by heating the samples to 140 °C for 10 min. The thickness of AZO films is approximately 40 nm. Afterwards the samples including a P3TMAHT interlayer were immersed in a methanolic P3TMAHT solution with a concentration of ca. 1 mg mL−1 for 24 h (Mn P3TMAHT: 8000 g mol−1, estimated by GPC with PS calibration). Doctor-bladed P3TMAHT films were annealed at 120 °C for 5 min in ambient air to form an interlayer of ca. 5 nm. The BHJ active layers (ca. 90–100 nm) were also doctor bladed in ambient air from the solution of N(Ph-2T-DCN-Et)3:PC70BM (1:2 weight ratio) in dichlorobenzene without any other process. Finally 10 nm MoOx and 100 nm Ag were deposited sequentially under 6 × 10−6 Torr by thermal evaporation through a shadow mask to form an active area of 10.4 mm2.
Conventional architecture devices
After drying as mentioned above, the substrates were bladed with 50 nm PEDOT:PSS (Heraeus, Clevios P VP.Al 4083). Photovoltaic layers consisted of N(Ph-2T-DCN-Et)3:PC70BM (1:2 weight ratio) in dichlorobenzene and were bladed on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer. Finally, a calcium/silver top electrode of 15/80 nm thickness was evaporated. The typical active area of the investigated devices was also 10.4 mm2.
Characterization methods
The current–voltage characteristics of the solar cells were measured under AM 1.5G irradiation on an OrielSol1A Solar simulator (100 mW cm−2). Most of device performances mentioned in this paper are corrected for the EQE of the particular device. The EQE was detected with a Cary 500 Scan UV-vis-NIR Spectrophotometer under monochromatic illumination, which was calibrated with a monocrystalline silicon diode. The morphology was investigated by AFM (Veeco Model D3100, tapping mode). The work function of various layers was measured by using a Kelvin probe (Kelvin Probe Technologies Inc., SKP5050) in air.
