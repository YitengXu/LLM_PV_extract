1. Introduction
During the past two decades, organic solar cells (OSCs) have attained remarkable fame due to their unique characteristics such as low cost, easy processing, light weight and flexibility.1–3 Typical OSCs consist of an organic active layer sandwiched between the anode and the cathode. In principle, the organic active layer contains a p-type material as the electron-donor and an n-type material as the electron-acceptor and could be fabricated as a bilayer or bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blend (as shown in Fig. 1). The BHJ configuration represents the most effective strategy to maximize the internal donor–acceptor interfacial area allowing for efficient charge separation and to form an interpenetrating bicontinuous network for both electron and hole transport.

For photovoltaic materials, strong efforts have been devoted to designing electron-donor and electron-acceptor materials. Among a large amount of building blocks, porphyrin occupied an important position in the design and synthesis of photovoltaic materials. Porphyrins are tetrapyrrolic 18 π-electron aromatic macrocycles and get their name from the Greek word for purple, porphura (πορφúρα). The application of porphyrins in OSCs is inspired by their natural photosynthetic systems, specifically chlorophylls.4,5 Porphyrins have many remarkable features: (1) they are excellent light harvesters (because of their high molar absorptivity coefficients) in both the blue (Soret or B-band) and the red (Q-band) part of the visible spectrum, (2) their optical and electronic properties can be easily fine-tuned by straightforward synthetic modifications at the periphery (meso- and β-positions, Fig. 2) and variations of the metal center,6 (3) they are air stable and quite robust, (4) they have good thermal stability, (5) they exhibit strong two-photon absorption and (6) they also exhibit efficient electron transfer.7,8

It is well-known that a porphyrin core has strong electron-donating ability and an extensive π-conjugated system. Its charge distribution and frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) are graphically depicted in Fig. 2. The electrostatic potential (ESP) map clearly showed a totally green surface, indicating the electron-rich nature of the porphyrin core. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) distributions of the porphyrin core are almost the same, and electron-deficient groups are needed to transfer charge from electron-rich porphyrin to electron-deficient units. The number and nature of electron-deficient groups should be carefully selected on the basis of their utilization as electron donors or electron acceptors for OSCs.
In fact, porphyrins are extensively used for dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), and numerous research articles and several review papers have been published.9–17 However, just a limited number of review articles are found related to porphyrin-based BHJ OSCs,17,18 and these review articles are also brief. To date, there has been no review article that is solely devoted to porphyrinic small-molecules. After the disappointing results of early years, substantial developments of porphyrin-based photovoltaic materials have been realized in the last few years. Thus, in this review, we will summarize the design and synthesis of porphyrin-based materials and their application in OSCs. This review will provide a better understanding of the relationships between the molecular structure and the device performance.
2. The synthesis of a porphyrin core
The synthesis of a porphyrin core structure is illustrated in Fig. 3. Firstly, a porphyrin core can be easily synthesized via the acid catalyzed condensation between two equivalents of an aldehyde functionalized with the desired flexible side chains and two equivalents of a dipyrrole compound. The synthesis of the aldehyde and dipyrrole starting materials from basic building blocks has also been reported.19 Secondly, the synthesized porphyrin core can be subsequently brominated at the available methylene units, which could provide adequate sites for further reactivity. Finally, the porphyrin is equipped with a metal center (e.g. Zn, Cu, Ni, Fe, etc.); one of these can be incorporated into the cavity of the porphyrin by reacting it with a given metal salt.20 Further modification to the prepared porphyrin core depends on the desired carbon–carbon bond-forming reaction for the remaining synthetic procedures. For example, a porphyrin core can be borylated with an organoboronic acid or ester for Suzuki cross-couplings.21 Alternatively, an alkyne can be installed from trimethylsilylacetylene following the removal of the trimethylsilyl functionality, for Sonogashira cross-couplings.5
 Fig. 3  General procedure for the synthesis of a porphyrin core. 
These functionalities provide sites of reactivity for a given transition metal catalyst for C–C bond-forming reactions, leading to porphyrins that can be flanked by common acceptor building blocks and enabling the well-known donor–acceptor (D–A) approach to be extended to these materials.
Many research studies in the last decade proved that polymeric materials were not the sole option used for OSCs. Some small molecules and oligomers synthesized from similar building blocks used for low band-gap co-polymers could also realize competitive solar cell efficiencies.22,23 Even small molecules show some advantages over polymers such as straightforward synthesis, high(er) purity, higher charge-carrier mobilities, and so on. Also, their FMO energy levels, band-gap, photo-physical properties and crystallization can be modulated easily.
Both the high structural versatility and ease of synthesis of porphyrins offer many design options for the development of OSC materials. Free base porphyrins and zinc porphyrins are extensively used as compared to other metallo-porphyrins, such as Mg, Cu, Mn and Sn. Porphyrin materials have been classified on the basis of their function in OSCs and their structural features. Herein, we will discuss one by one as below.
3. Porphyrin-containing polymers as electron donors
There are several ways to construct polymers using porphyrin macrocycles to take advantage of their excellent optoelectronic properties. Porphyrinoids can be used as the main backbone or side-chain in polymers. Cao et al. synthesized several porphyrin-functionalized copolymers24 (A1–A4) by two-step reactions (Fig. 4), and the best PCE of 0.32% was obtained for the A1:PCBM combination. However, the PCE and Jsc decreased with an increase of porphyrin content in these copolymers. Emission spectra indicated electron transfer from the PPV backbone to the porphyrin side-chain and then to PCBM. Therefore, charge separation and energy transfer between the PPV backbone and PCBM might decrease with the increase of porphyrin content. So, two-step processes are less efficient than one-step processes and lead to low PCEs. On the other hand, the same synthetic approach could be applied to polythiophenes24,25 (A5 and A6) as well.26 For the regiorandom copolythiophene A5 polymer, a PCE of 1.08% was achieved;25 however, the efficiency of its regioregular analogue A6 was disappointing (0.21%).26 Both donor polymers show lower PCEs than their non-porphyrin counterparts. It seems that inserting a porphyrin chromophore has detrimental effects on the active layer morphology.

Copolymers containing a porphyrin segment in the conjugated backbone have also been strongly investigated. Firstly, Bo et al. developed two Zn–porphyrin-alt-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene copolymers (A7 and A8) by Pd-catalyzed Stille and Sonogashira cross-coupling procedures. The resulting materials were used as donors in OSCs.27 Copolymer A8 showed a red-shifted emission and absorption spectrum as well as stronger Q-band absorption (760 nm in film) than A7 because of the coplanar extended π-conjugated polymer chain with the introduction of two triple bonds. Copolymer A8 showed a PCE of 0.30% which is double the value obtained from A7.
Later, Imahori et al. synthesized two porphyrin–furan (A9) and porphyrin–thiophene (A10) polymers7 using the Stille polycondensation reaction. A9 showed a PCE of 0.048%, which is higher than that of A10 (0.027%). The authors argued that A9 shows a relatively better PCE due to its better delocalization of the π-electrons that could lead to a better hole-transporting ability. Even the efficiency of BHJ devices was inferior; these devices showed strong fluorescence quenching and charge-transfer (CT) emissions, which indicate strong interactions between fullerenes and porphyrins.
Tan et al. prepared two polymer donors28 (A11 and A12) with alkoxyphenyl-bedecked Zn–porphyrin and different conjugated oligo/polythiophene units. Terthiophene and oligothiophene were integrated into the polymer chains because of their low oxidation potential and good light-harvesting characteristics. OSC devices based on these two polymers showed PCEs of 0.32% and 0.18% for A11 and A12, respectively. A11 showed a higher PCE due to its ability to absorb a broad range (590–650 nm). The same group reported two star-shaped polymer donors (A13 and A14) via Stille polycondensation, with or without triphenylamine as the end-capper.29 Non-end capped polymer A13 shows a better performance (PCE = 0.61%) than A14.
In the above-mentioned polymer samples, the electron-rich porphyrin unit was combined with other electron-rich groups to conform to the D–D′ type polymer backbone. To broaden the absorption spectrum, D–A type polymers with alternating electron-rich and electron-deficient groups are used, which leads to the delocalization of the conjugated backbone and then the reduction of the band-gap. Tan et al. used electron deficient 2,1,3-benzo-thiadiazole (BT) along with porphyrin to construct two donors A15 and A16 (Fig. 5). A16 shows a better PCE of 0.91% than A15 due to its high Jsc (because of broad and red-shifted absorption in the 450–700 nm range) and Voc (resulted from its lower HOMO levels).30 In principle, the above-mentioned polymers (A1–A16) can be ranked as oligomers instead of polymers because their molecular weights are relatively low. It has been proven in many cases that polymers with a high molecular weight could achieve a relatively high PCE.31–34 Therefore, it is necessary to increase the molecular weight of porphyrin-based polymers. Moon et al. synthesized two copolymers (A17 and A18, Fig. 5) with relatively high molar masses (Mn = 19.7 K and 15.2 K for A17 and A18, respectively). Fluorene or carbazole was connected with porphyrin using Suzuki polycondensation.35 Carbazole-based donor A18 showed a relatively high PCE of 0.76% with a high fullerene ratio in the blend (Table 1). In 2011, the Harvey group reported the synthesis of polyplatinyne-containing Zn–porphyrin donor polymers (A19–A21, Fig. 5).36A21 with direct meso-thienyl linkages showed the highest efficiency of 1.04% which is due to its high Jsc resulting from its intense and stronger absorption. In 2014, Thamyongkit and co-workers synthesized a polydiacetylene-nested porphyrin polymer (A22, Fig. 5).37 Basically PDA was introduced to increase the solubility and decrease the π–π stacking of the porphyrins. BHJ OSCs based on this donor showed poor device performances (PCE = 0.2%). Furthermore, the Li group employed a different concept to synthesize several porphyrin-containing polymers. Porphyrin was fused with quinoxaline and was used as the electron-deficient unit to copolymerize with carbazole and oligothiophene π-bridging groups (A23–A26, Fig. 5).37 Fused quinoxaline could increase the coplanarity of the polymer main chain which restricts the inherent large dihedral angles and leads to strong intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT). These low band-gap polymers (1.66–1.73 eV) show good thermal stability, high solubility and wide absorption spectra. A25 gives the best PCE of 2.53%, but A26 shows inferior performance even though it shows broader absorption and higher hole mobility than others.38 Later, the same group extended their idea by replacing carbazole with fluorene or benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene and synthesized two polymers (A27 and A28, Fig. 6).39 Fluorene-containing copolymer A27 shows a deeper HOMO level and attains a higher Voc of 0.81 V in OSCs than A28. They also synthesized a donor–acceptor copolymer A29 and optimized the device performance by varying the donor:acceptor weight ratios in the blend, and the best PCE of 2.53% was obtained with the 1:3 ratio.40

 Fig. 6  Porphyrin-containing electron donor polymers for BHJ OSCs (Part 3). 
It is well-known that the broad absorption from the UV-vis to the IR region is necessary to improve the Jsc and PCE of OSCs. Both porphyrin and DPP have planar π-structures and complementary absorption from UV to near-infrared (NIR). Thus, it is a promising idea to combine these units to construct the donor polymer, and it has been successfully used to construct efficient donor small molecule (SM) materials.49 Bucher et al. synthesized a polymer of poly(porphyrin–diketopyrrolopyrrole) (A30) and used it as a donor to combine with PC71BM. They used thermal annealing (TA) and subsequent solvent annealing (SVA), and the PCE increased from 4.18% to 6.44% with a low energy loss of 0.51 eV.41 Photoluminescence (PL) quenching efficiency indicates that the intermixing of donors and acceptors is necessary to form interpenetrating charge transporting networks. The time-resolved emission spectra (TRES) can be monitored in solution using a streak camera (Fig. 7a). Decay-associated spectra extracted from the TRES exhibit three components (Fig. 7b). The lifetimes, τFs, are consistent with the previously reported TCSPC results (500 and 200 ps). The long τF (426 ps) is associated with ICT fluorescence whereas the two short components (136 and 38 ps) are attributed to J-aggregate emission between 850 and 900 nm. These values are consistent with the 100 (ref. 50) and 180 ps data of porphyrin J-aggregates reported as mono-exponential decays51 and with 320 and 80 ps reported as bi-exponential decays.52

Many conjugated polymers especially those with a low band-gap could realize excellent photovoltaic performance as donor materials. However, in the case of porphyrin-based polymers, the photovoltaic performance was relatively poor in the early stagy. The work of Hsu et al. led to a big breakthrough, and an astounding efficiency of 8.6% was obtained using a 2D donor–acceptor copolymer (A31, Fig. 6). This material was ranked as the top electron-donor polymer for OSCs.42 Tan et al. synthesized an asymmetrical donor–acceptor (D–A) polymer (A32, Fig. 6) using a benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) unit. They also synthesized a polymer (A33, Fig. 6) with an extended absorption spectrum by inserting 4,7-di(4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)benzothiadiazole (T-DTBT) into the main chain of the copolymer.39 BHJ devices of these polymers were fabricated with PC61BM as the acceptor. A33 showed a higher PCE compared to A32 because of its deep HOMO energy level, low band-gap and broad absorption range.
The remarkable success of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based polymers inspired the Li group to use DPP to construct polymers. They synthesized three polymers (A34–A36, Fig. 6) by Stille coupling polymerization and used them as donors with PC71BM in BHJ OSCs. A36 with a high DPP ratio showed a higher performance (PCE = 5.07%) because of a high Jsc of 11.85 mA cm−2 which resulted from its excellent absorption. A34 with a high ratio of quinoxalino[2,3-b]porphyrin (QP) showed an inferior performance that can be explained by the weak absorption and large band-gap.43 In addition, the different performances of these polymers are also related to the crystallinity, and the increase of the ratio of QP leads to a less ordered structure because of the hindrance of the bulky QP unit. A36 with just one QP unit shows a sharper diffraction peak as an indicator of a highly crystalline blend film. In 2014, Clément et al. used a supramolecular approach to synthesize two P3HT-type conjugated copolymers (A37 and A38, Fig. 8) by coordinating a polythiophene copolymer bearing imidazo to central zinc ions.44 Addition of porphyrin has extended the absorption range to the region of 420–650 nm. Both donors show very low PCEs of 0.15% and 0.24% for A37 and A38, respectively.
 Fig. 8  Porphyrin-containing electron donor polymers for BHJ OSCs (Part 4). 
Bronstein et al. synthesized two novel donors (A39 and A40, Fig. 8) by attaching P3HT chains to the porphyrin core.45 These two donors were paired with PC71BM, and P3HT was also incorporated into a BHJ cell as the standard to find the effect of porphyrin core. A39 and A40 show low PCEs (2.8% and 2.9%, respectively) as compared to P3HT (3.2%). The decrease of efficiency predominantly comes from the low Jsc. This can be explained on the basis of inefficient energy transfer from the polymer backbone to the porphyrin core because of the poor spectral overlap of the two species. Moreover, platinum in porphyrin could enhance the direct intersystem crossing (ISC) rate of the P3HT singlet excitons that is responsible for photocurrent loss by triplet formations, a common loss pathway in OSCs.
Later, Mazzocchetti et al. synthesized two porphyrinated alkylthiophene polymer donors (A41 and A42, Fig. 8). They also synthesized their brominated counterparts to elucidate the effect of porphyrin. The porphyrin-containing copolymers show better performance because of their higher fill-factor (FF) and Jsc than their counterparts.46 Basically, tetraphenylporphyrins have strong absorption at around 420 nm (Soret band) and negligible absorption in the 500–700 nm range (Q band).
Honestly speaking, designing efficient photovoltaic polymers is very complicated; many requirements need to be met at the same time. Because the rigid backbone of the polymer decreases its solubility in organic solvents, introducing flexible side chains to the main backbone could increase its solubility but decrease its light absorption ability due to the decrease of polymer chromophore ratio. Adding porphyrin as the end-group can be a way to get reasonable absorption ability and solubility. The Li group synthesized two polymers by Stille coupling of bithiophene (BT) and DPP with end-caps of thiophene, quinoxalino[2,3-b]porphyrin (A43, Fig. 8), and quinoxalino[2,3-b]porphyrinatozinc (A44, Fig. 8).47 Findings of their studies indicated that these polymer donors showed enhancements of light absorption and better photovoltaic performance as compared to their counterpart polymers without the porphyrin-end group.
Polymers based on porphyrin and DPP are already reported. By getting inspiration from these studies, Tan and co-workers synthesized a series of copolymers (A45–A48, Fig. 8) based on zinc porphyrin (ZP) and DPP.48 They have tried to tune the ratios of ZP derivatives and DPP units. A47 with a ZP/DPP ratio of 1:4 shows strong absorption in the range of 400–900 nm and a PCE of 2.44% with a Jsc of 6.14 mA cm−2.
4. Porphyrin-based dyads and triads as the active layer
It is reasonable that photo-induced electron transfer between a donor and an acceptor can be increased by covalently linking the donor and acceptor as one single-molecule. In the early stage, porphyrin–fullerene based dyads and triads were synthesized and used for solution-processed solar cells. However, it is very difficult to decrease the charge recombination, although the phase separation could be controlled easily. In addition, supramolecular solar cells based on porphyrin and fullerene are also extensively reported in the literature.3,53–55
Zhu et al. prepared a fulleropyrrolidine–perylenetetracarboxylic diimide–porphyrin triad FPP (B1) and its Zn analogue B2 (Fig. 9).56 In these two molecules, perylenetetracarboxylic diimide is an ideal accessory pigment acting as an electron-acceptor to the porphyrin chromophore57,58 and an electron-donor to the fullerene. Organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices based on them show very low efficiencies (0.028% for B1 and 0.035% for B2). However, they showed a wide absorption band in the visible region of the solar spectrum. Even though the efficiencies were low, this study proved an encouraging step toward future research.
 Fig. 9  The chemical structures of porphyrin-based dyads and triads. 
Tamura et al. synthesized a dyad (B3, Fig. 9) consisting of tetrabenzoporphyrin (BP) and C60 units (BP–C60). In this single-molecule, the donor (BP) and the acceptor (C60) are connected by covalent linkages. Not surprisingly, it showed a relatively low efficiency (0.15%).59 However, the PL of porphyrin could be successfully quenched by C60, and photo-induced electron transfer could be observed. Kumar et al. tested a single-material OSC using a porphyrin–fullerene dyad B4 (Fig. 9).60 Strong fluorescence quenching was also observed, which indicated the efficient charge-transfer between the porphyrin core and the fullerene. This dyad also was tested in BHJ OSCs and showed an inferior performance (Table 2).

5. Porphyrin-based small-molecules as electron donors
A large amount of porphyrin-based small-molecule donors could be found in the literature and their numbers are growing every year. Therefore, we have further divided these small molecule donors on the basis of the number of porphyrin units.
5.1. Small molecule donors with single-porphyrin
In 2007, Li and co-workers used liquid crystalline free base porphyrins C1 and C2 (Fig. 10) as donors in BHJ OSCs.61 A high Jsc and PCE were obtained by thermal annealing, which resulted in the porphyrin alignment in the active layer blend. After the annealing, the C1 based device achieved a Jsc of 3.990 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 0.712%, while the C2 based device exhibited a Jsc of 5.02 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 0.775%. Oku et al. synthesized a simple porphyrin donor C3 (Fig. 10), in which four benzene rings are connected to the porphyrin core via ethynyl-linkages.62 The C3:C60 device shows a very low efficiency (0.078%). The tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis indicated a smooth surface with an RMS value of 0.43 nm.
 Fig. 10  The chemical structures of small molecule donors with single-porphyrin (Part 1). 
In 2010, Lee et al. studied the effects of molecular alignments on the performance of OSCs using etioporphyrin-I (C4) and octaethylporphyrin (C5) (Fig. 10). The results indicated that optical and charge-transporting properties were changed with the changes of structures. C4 showed a higher PCE due to higher charge carrier mobility and broader absorbance than C5.63 In 2011, Hawker et al. used a thermally degradable binder strategy for porphyrin and fullerene based OSCs.64 A poly(propylene carbonate) binder was used to control the solution viscosity which increased the flexibility in the choice and processing of the acceptor. These BHJ OSCs showed a comparable performance to that obtained using a previously used method of simply mixing C6 (Fig. 10) and PCBNB, suggesting that the decomposable binder does not degrade the PCE. In the same year, Itoh et al. investigated the photovoltaic performance of tetraphenyl porphyrin (C7 and C8, Fig. 10)-based multilayered OSCs.65 The Voc increased with the thickness of porphyrin layers between 10 and 30 nm. NiO and MoO3 were used as oxide hole collection layers, which improved the Voc and FF.
In principle, both solvent annealing and thermal annealing are physical treatments, which only change the thin film morphology and do not affect the chemical composition of the film. However, the chemical annealing method changes the morphology as well the chemical composition of the organic film. Thompson et al. used chemical annealing with pyrazine (PZ) and triazine (TZ) for zinc tetraphenylporphyrin (C8) based OSCs.66 According to AFM analysis, ZnTPP films showed the signs of aggregations upon chemical annealing with nitrogen-based ligands. The chemical annealing changed the ZnTPP film from amorphous to an ordered crystalline structure which leads to a longer exciton diffusion length, good conductivity, and an improved Jsc and FF of OSCs. However, low Voc was obtained due to the PP recombination rate at the D/A heterojunction.
In 2012, Matsuo et al. synthesized three porphyrin donors possessing a Mg(II)-tetraethynylporphyrin core connected with two aromatic and two aliphatic substituents via ethynyl-linkages (C9–C11, Fig. 10).67 Phenylethynyl-extended Mg–porphyrin C9 showed a PCE of 2.5%, higher than those of the other two materials (C10: 0.57%, C11: 0.25%). The same group used a scrambling synthesis protocol to prepare the analogous donor C12 (Fig. 10).68 With PC61BM as the acceptor, it showed a PCE of 1.5%. These results indicate that the PCE is not sensitive to the amount of acceptor.
Joo et al. synthesized five donors based on Zn–tetrakisthiopheneporphyrins (C13–C15, Fig. 10) and Zn–bisthiopheneporphyrins (C16 and C17, Fig. 11) to investigate the effect of π-conjugation system. Donors C13–C15 have different numbers of thiophenes in the conjugated system. C16 and C17 were synthesized by replacing phenyl linkers with ethynyl ones between the porphyrin framework and the thiophenes.69C13–C15 based devices showed lower PCEs compared with those of C16 and C17. The PCEs decreased with the increase of the number of thiophene rings. The high PCEs of C16 and C17 are ascribed to the strongly enhanced Jsc that should have resulted from ethynyl units. C16 showed a PCE of 1.0% but the analogous material C17 showed a slightly lower efficiency due to the bulky ortho,ortho′-hexyloxy groups.
 Fig. 11  The chemical structures of small molecule donors with single-porphyrin (Part 2). 
M. A. J. Velez et al. fabricated BHJ OSCs using meso-tetrakis(4-bromophenyl) zinc(II) porphyrin (C18, Fig. 11) as an electron-donor and fullerene as an electron-acceptor.70 They studied the effect of anodic buffer layer using MoO3 or MoO3–CuI. The results indicate that the MoO3–CuI bilayer could increase the PCE of the device. The same group used meso-tetrakis(5-bromo-2-thienyl)porphyrin (C19, Fig. 11) as an electron-donor in a multilayer OSC and achieved a PCE of 1.32% by using MoO3/CuI as an anode layer.71
Coutsolelos et al. synthesized a very simple pyridinylethynyl group-bearing porphyrin (C20, Fig. 11) by an Adler–Longo mixed aldehyde synthesis protocol.72 This porphyrin was combined with PC61BM or PC71BM in BHJ blends, and the resulting OSCs showed relatively high PCEs of 1.96 and 2.54%, respectively. The PCE could be increased to 3.27% after thermal annealing and then further increased to a top value (4.06%) by using a DMF-treated PEDOT:PSS buffer layer.
It is well known that two chromophores can be connected together to get maximum light harvesting ability. Triazine (Tz) has been successfully used to connect different chromophores in metal free organic dyes.73–75 The chemical, structural and electronic properties of this moiety allow us to design multichromophore complexes with improved light-harvesting ability, and high electron injection and transportation rates.76,77
In 2015, Sharma et al. prepared a mono(carboxy)porphyrin-triazine-(bodipy)2 triad (C21, Fig. 11) and used it as an electron-donor for BHJ OSCs.78 The device showed a PCE value of 3.48% that increased to 5.29% on the addition of pyridine due to the good charge-transportation and charge collection rates resulting from the optimal crystallinity and morphology of the active layer (Table 3).

Peng et al. got a push–pull motif (C23, Fig. 11),6 by combining the porphyrin core and the typical acceptor of 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole using ethynylenes and then end-capped with 3-hexylthienyl. For comparison, two TBTs were linked to the porphyrin core directly (without ethynylene linkages) to form C22 (Fig. 11). The photovoltaic performance of these was tested with PC71BM; C23 exhibited a PCE of up to 4.02%. In contrast, the device based on C22 only exhibited a PCE of 0.71%. This can be explained on the basis of a higher hole mobility of C23 (7.4 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1) as compared to that of C22 (2.5 × 10−9 cm2 V−1 s−1).
Mishra et al. studied the effect of metal center on the photovoltaic performance of porphyrin-based BHJ OSCs.79 Solution-processed BHJ devices were fabricated by employing C24 (Ni) or C25 (Cu) or C26 (Zn) (Fig. 11) as electron donors and PC71BM as an electron acceptor. The PCE values were found to be 4.51%, 5.42% and 6.18% with a Jsc of 9.34 mA cm−2, 10.13 mA cm−2 and 12.25 mA cm−2, respectively, for C24 (Ni), C25 (Cu) and C26 (Zn). However, the C26 (Zn) based device showed a relatively lower Voc due to its high-lying HOMO. It is well known that the overall PCE of the OSC is strongly affected by the charge carrier mobility.80 All devices showed similar electron-mobility, but the C26 (Zn) based device showed a higher hole-mobility compared to the others. Low energy loss is another promising feature of C26 (Zn).
5.2. Donors with single-porphyrin with the A–D–A configuration
DPP is an excellent unit to construct the organic materials for OPV applications.81 Its strong electron-withdrawing ability provides the possibility to redshift the absorption into the near-IR (NIR) region.82,83 DPP-based molecules usually show high charge carrier mobilities due to their rigid and planar aromatic structures that facilitate the intermolecular packing.84,85 Therefore, in 2013, Peng et al. synthesized D1 (Fig. 12) by linking two DPP moieties on both sides of a porphyrin segment.12D1 realized a broad absorption spectrum which spanned the near-IR region with a high absorption coefficient. The BHJ OSC based on the D1:PC61BM (1:1) blend realized a PCE of 3.71% (Table 4). In addition, further device optimization using pyridine as a solvent additive led to an improved PCE of 4.78%, where pyridine addition showed a balancing effect on the charge carrier mobilities: enhanced the hole mobility while slightly decreasing the electron mobility. Then, Peng et al. further synthesized D2 (Fig. 12) using 4-octyloxy-phenyl groups instead of 3,5-di(dodecyloxy)-phenyl groups.5 It showed a high PCE over 7% for solution-processed BHJ OSCs. Long chains of the dodecyloxy groups protruded out of the porphyrin plane and were responsible for suppressing the intermolecular π–π stacking. The hole mobility was 4.68 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the D2-based device which is much higher than the value of 1.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the device based on D1.12

In 2016, Peng et al. studied the impact of different methods to remove additives (DIO) on the film morphology of the BHJ OSCs based on the porphyrin small molecule (D2).86 A high PCE of up to 7.78% and a large Jsc of 19.25 mA cm−2 could be achieved upon DIO additive annealing for about 1 h at ambient pressure before moving them to a vacuum chamber for drying. Compared to the conventional removal of additives by quick vacuuming and methanol washing, additive annealing treatment improved the ordering of donor molecules and the growth of crystallites with small length scale phase separation (<100 nm) in BHJ blend films and led to the formation of better crystalline domains. The J–V curves and EQEs of OPVs based on different methods of removing additives are shown in Fig. 13.

In addition, the same group used toluene and o-xylene instead of toxic halogenated solvents to fabricate D2:PC61BM devices and realized PCEs of 5.46% and 5.85%, respectively.87 Later, Peng et al. studied the impacts of the chalcogen atoms O and Se in the linking of the 5-membered ring of DPP on the performance of OSCs (D3–D4, Fig. 12).88 The heavy atoms extended the absorption spectrum and reduced the band-gap. BHJ OSCs based on furan- and selenophene-containing donors showed PCEs of 4.3% and 5.8%, respectively. The relatively high performance of the D4 based device is ascribed to the better miscibility and smaller phase with PC61BM. In 2015, they further designed and synthesized a low band-gap (1.37 eV) DPP-based donor of D5 (Fig. 12) that showed a broad light absorption up to 907 nm and a Voc of 0.78 V with energy losses < 0.6 eV.89 The optimized device showed an EQE of up to 65%, a Jsc of 16.76 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 8.08%, respectively. In the same year, they synthesized two new donors (D6 and D7, Fig. 12) differing in the size of the alkyl chain at the meso-position of porphyrin.90 Thanks to the synergic efforts from material chemistry and device optimization, a champion device based on D6:PC71BM was obtained with the highest Jsc of 19.58 mA cm−2 and PCE of 9.06%, but the device based on D7:PC71BM showed a PCE of 8.24%. The same group also fabricated a D6:PC61BM based-device and showed an efficiency of 8.61% with a high Jsc of 18.53 mA cm−2 due to the broad absorption of D6, especially in the NIR range. Furthermore, when D6:PC71BM was used as the rear subcell, the tandem solar cell could realize a super high PCE of 12.5%,91 which demonstrates that small-molecule-based tandem cells might be a very competitive alternative in the pursuit of possible future OSC commercialization.
Langa et al. also designed and synthesized an A–D–A donor (D8, Fig. 12), and after optimization of the morphology (the weight ratio and the solvent additive), an efficiency of 7.04% was attained.92 Transmission electron microscopy measurements indicated the presence of black and white domains corresponding to the PC71BM-rich and porphyrin-rich regions, respectively. Active layers showed fine phase separation between the PC71BM and the porphyrin domains. Performance variation of structurally similar donors (D5–D8) indicates that side chains play a key role in controlling the aggregation behaviors and nanoscale interpenetrating networks.
A porphyrin-based molecule D9 (Fig. 12) with bulky benzothiophene groups was reported by Peng et al. as an electron-donor material for BHJ OSCs.93 The optimized device upon thermal annealing and then chloroform solvent vapor annealing for 80 s exhibited an outstanding PCE of 9.08%. All donors of D1–D9 are structurally similar, just differing in alkyl or aromatic groups at the peripheral positions of the porphyrin core. The difference in PCE values was due to the significant change in Jsc and FF values, and their Voc values are not much different. Basically, the impact of alkyl or aromatic groups on energy levels is minor but they significantly affect the film morphology and charge transport properties.
Matsuo et al. first synthesized Mg–tetraethynylporphyrin complexes (D10–D13, Fig. 12) with different aryl groups.94 The role of metal center is very important, and it is expected that lighter Mg can increase the solubility and can lead to a longer excited-state lifetime. All molecules showed strong absorption at around 500 nm (Soret band) and around 800 nm (Q-band). D11 showed the best efficiency of 5.73% among these molecules due to the phase-separated structure resulting from the n-hexyl substituent on the aryl groups.
5.3. Donors with single-porphyrin having the A–π–D–π–A configuration
A conjugated push–pull structure can be achieved by combining electron-rich and electron-poor structural units, thereby reducing the optical band-gap via molecular orbital hybridization, which could extend the absorption, as well as offering control over the separation of the HOMO and LUMO electron density in the molecule in order to facilitate charge-transfer. In the state-of-the-art design of A–π–D–π–A, the porphyrin core needs to be connected with two acceptor groups through conjugated systems at two opposite meso-positions. In addition, the other two meso-positions need to remained to link alkyl or aromatic groups. One would wonder why the remaining meso-positions are not occupied by the electron-deficient groups. Basically, four electron-deficient groups can decrease the electronic density and/or light-harvesting capability of the porphyrin core. In addition, alkyl or aromatic groups are used to enhance the solubility and control the film morphology. The expansion of π-conjugation extends the spectral window and enhance the light-harvesting ability of the porphyrin core, leading to the absorption spectrum extending to NIR regions.
As we know, thiophene is the most typical structural moiety in the whole catalogue of OPV materials. Optimization of the number of thiophenes in π-spacer units could significantly improve the film morphology and efficiency. Thienylevinylene is an extensively used derivative of thiophene, and mostly, alkyl chains are used to enhance the solubility. Herein, we will review several porphyrin donors containing the thienylevinylene π-spacer.
Langa et al. in 2015 synthesized two new conjugated donors (E1 and E2, Fig. 14) with the A–π–D–π–A skeleton.95 The red-shift resulted from the electron-withdrawing dicyanovinylene moiety. E2 with longer conjugation showed a better PCE of 3.21% as compared to E1 (1.4%). These results can be explained on the basis of their film morphologies. The E1-based device showed a relatively smoother surface morphology with smaller aggregated sizes than that of E2, which is responsible for efficient dissociation at the donor–acceptor interface.
 Fig. 14  The chemical structures of single-porphyrin based molecules with the A–π–D–π–A configuration. 
In 2016, they used the same strategy to design two donors (E3 and E4, Fig. 14) that were end-capped with N-ethyl-rhodanine as acceptor units. Use of rhodanine as the acceptor unit inspired a hypothesis that strong acceptors can enhance the charge transfer character and increase the light-harvesting efficiency. E4 showed a higher efficiency as compared with E3 due to its extended conjugation.96 Here again, the surface topography is a reason behind the better performance of E4. The surface topographies of the film of the E4:PC71BM (1:4) blend displayed rather uniform nanometer-sized features with a root-mean-square roughness (RMS) value of 0.53 nm. However, the E3-based device showed a coarser topography, with a higher RMS value of 0.62 nm. The smooth surface of the E4-based device indicates the good phase intermixing that is beneficial for phase-separation, efficient exciton diffusion and charge transportation.
Palomares et al. designed and synthesized a donor (E5, Fig. 14) with a shorter conjugated system as compared to E1–E4.97 The PCE improved from 3.65% to 5.24% on the addition of pyridine. The enhancement of the PCE comes from the high Jsc and FF resulting from the strong and the broad incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) response and balanced charge transportation. For the devices fabricated with THF, hole and electron mobilities are 5.62 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.45 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, while hole and electron mobilities for the devices prepared with pyridine–THF are 8.34 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.32 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Thus, addition of pyridine is responsible for balancing charge transportation.
It was believed that the alkyl chain plays a very important role in enhancing the solubility of small molecules in organic solvents, as well as controlling the crystallinity and film morphology.98 Wang et al. synthesized three donors with different meso-substituents (5,15-bis(2-octylundecyl): E6, 5,15-bis(3-octyl-1-tridecyl): E7, 5,15-bis(4-octyl-1-tetra-decyl): E8) (Fig. 14). Ethynylbenzene was used as a π-spacer, while 3-ethylrhodanine (RH) was used as the electron-deficient group.99 Unexpectedly, as compared with E6 (6.49%) and E8 (5.12%), the performance of the E7-based device was much inferior (PCE = 2.53%). We move the discussion to the core point, the morphology of the blend; E6 and E8 showed rough nodular character when compared to E7, especially E6. Lower roughness and smaller phase separation for E6 indicated smaller phase separation leading to a higher Jsc value and a higher PCE. Surface roughness values are inversely related to the efficiency.
Peng and co-workers synthesized similar compounds (E9–E11, Fig. 14) just differing in groups at meso-positions. BHJ OSCs using E9–E11 as donor materials, together with PC61BM and PC71BM as acceptor materials, were fabricated90 All donors showed higher efficiencies with PC71BM (3.21% for E9, 5.07% for E10, and 5.20% for E11vs. 1.42% for E9, 4.55% for E10, and 4.98% for E11, respectively). They selected E11 to study the effect of the other factors. The results indicate that E11 showed the highest PCE of 6.11% at an annealing time of 5 min due to a significant increase in the FF. When they increased the D/A weight ratio (1:1.2), an efficiency of 7.70% was obtained (6.11% at 1:1). Device stability was also studied; after 3 days, the PCE reduced to 7.55%. Even when the device was stored in air for 30 days, 83% of the original value was retained. The accuracy of the photovoltaic measurements can be confirmed with the EQE of the same devices. The EQE values of the devices based on E9 or E10 are below 50% in the range of 620–800 nm, resulting in lower Jsc values. This behavior is consistent with the weaker absorptions of E9 and E10 as compared to that of E11. E9–E11/PC71BM showed roughness values of 0.852, 0.780 and 0.567 nm, respectively. Relatively low values of RMS roughness for the E11-based device indicate that E11 has good miscibility with PC71BM and could form interpenetrating networks that led to efficient exciton separation and high charge transportation. However, E9/PC71BM and E10/PC71BM showed surface relief and a larger domain size, indicating failure to form good films because of perpendicular aromatic peripheral substitutions on the porphyrin core. Of the above discussed E9–E11 donors, E11 showed the champion performance due to the unique characteristics of the 10,20-bis(5,15-alkyl) substituent that led to more efficient intermolecular π–π stacking and a smooth surface morphology.
Palomares et al. synthesized a donor (E12, Fig. 14) with octyl thiophene-ethynylene as a π-spacer. The E12:PC71BM device showed a PCE of 2.95%,100 and this efficiency increased to 4.46% with the addition of 4% v/v pyridine in the THF solvent and further improved up to 5.50% after thermal annealing. It is worth noting here that E12:PC71BM shows a much lower PCE than other similar small molecule donors. The authors explained this inferior performance on the basis of impurity because the purity of E12 was 95% only. Basically, a small amount of impurities can significantly decrease the efficiency of OSCs.101 Even though Voc is reasonably high (0.82 V), low values of both the Jsc and FF are responsible for the low PCE.
Langa et al. designed and synthesized E13 and E14 (Fig. 14) with thienylenevinylenethiophene as a π-spacer and 3-ethylrhodanine (E13) or dicyanovinylene (E14) as an acceptor.102 Overall PCEs of 5.14% and 6.06% could be obtained from optimized devices (pyridine additive in chloroform) based on E13 and E14, respectively. When Li-TFSI was used as the chemical additive, the E14:PC71BM based device showed a PCE of 7.63%. In the same year, Peng et al. designed and prepared two porphyrin small molecules E15 and E16 (Fig. 14) in which 3,3′′-dihexyl-terthiophene (TT) was symmetrically conjugated to the 10,20-bis(2-octylundecyl)-porphyrin core (P) and then end-capped with 3-ethylrhodanine (R) and 2-(1,1-dicyano-methylene)-3-ethylrhodanine (RCN) terminal units.103 The processing engineering of their blend films with PC71BM afforded impressive PCEs of 7.66% and 8.21% for BHJ OSCs based on E15 and E16, respectively. The relatively higher efficiency of E16 than E15 is due to the stronger electron-withdrawing unit of RCN than R; the former is a derivative of rhodanine with an additional electron-deficient group substituted at the CS bond.
Palomares et al. reported the synthesis of small molecules (E17 and E18, Fig. 14) with a zinc porphyrin donor core and 3-ethylrhodanine terminal acceptors connected at the meso-positions by ethynylene groups and linked by one (E17) or two (E18) thienylenevinylene units.104 THF processed OSCs based on E17:PC71BM and E18:PC71BM showed PCEs of 2.75% and 3.18%, respectively, while, the overall PCE was significantly increased to 5.27% and 5.78% on the addition of pyridine/CB. On the addition of the CuSCN HTL in the pyridine/THF solution, the PCE reached 6.59% and 7.24% for E17:PC71BM and E18:PC71BM, respectively.
Two push–pull porphyrin donors were reported by Gao et al.E19 and E20 (Fig. 14) are end-capped with 3-ethylrhodanine and 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene) rhodanine electron-deficient groups, respectively. It is worth noting that in contrast to other push–pull molecules, conjugated systems of E19 and E20 have no alkyl change. Structurally these two donors are not much different and surprisingly, showed different performances. The E19:PC71BM device showed a PCE of 4.97%; however, E20:PC71BM showed a disappointing result (0.33%). The Voc of both devices was almost similar. E20:PC71BM showed very low values for the remaining parameters. In the case of E16 and E15, molecules with the 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene) rhodanine unit show better results as compared to ethylrhodanine containing E15. The literature also witnesses to the success of 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene) rhodanine as compared to ethylrhodanine.105 No need to be confused, just strong electron-withdrawing units are not key to get high efficiency. As a matter of fact, matching energy levels are the most critical requirements for efficient working of OSCs. The LUMO energy level of E19 aligns well with that of PCBM and led to splitting of excitons and generation of current, resulting in a high EQE. PL quenching experiments support this idea; the E19 pristine film exhibited an emission peak at 805 nm, and it is completely quenched in PCBM.
In most of the above-reported push–pull molecules, thienylenevinylenes (TVs) were used as π-spacers. The exceptionally low values of the attenuation factor shown by TVs (β = 0.016 Å−1) favor excellent electronic coupling between the donor and acceptor moieties.106 Recently, cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophenes (CPDTs) have attracted significant attention because of their high electrical conductivities and low band-gaps.107 Rigidified spacers show better intramolecular charge transfer as compared to their open chain analogues.108 Langa et al. used CPDT to connect the porphyrin core with the electron-acceptor rhodanine (E21) or dicyanovinylene (E22) (Fig. 14).109 Relatively high PCE values of 6.71% and 7.93% were attained for E21 and E22, respectively. Both devices showed a low energy loss of 0.55 eV. Here, we can find some interesting points by comparing E1vs.E22 and E3vs.E21. The former donors have thiophene as the π-spacer, while the latter have CPDT. Table 5 shows the significant difference between their performance: 1.24% vs. 7.93% and 3.01% vs. 6.71%. E21 and E22 showed higher performance as compared to their counterparts due to the appropriate energy level matching and optimal film morphology. These results are not unexpected; fused-thiophene usually shows higher hole mobility and absorptivity because of a larger π-conjugation degree and a better molecular planarity. Additionally, planar fused-thiophene facilitates intermolecular π–π packing interactions, resulting in the improved Jsc value of the OSCs.110

Recently, Langa et al. synthesized a small molecule donor E23 that is similar to E4, except for dicyanovinylene being substituted on the terminal acceptor.111 They performed this work to study the impact of different rhodanine end-capping units on the absorption spectra, molecular crystallinity, frontier molecular energy levels, charge transport properties, morphology of active layers, and photovoltaic performance of OSCs. The E23/PC71BM based device showed a PCE of 4.03% that is higher than that of E4/PC71BM (3.21%). After SVA treatment, their efficiency remarkably increased up to 8.80% and 7.61%, respectively. This enhancement of the efficiency can be explained on the basis of good nanoscale morphology as indicated by high hole and electron mobilities for SVA treated devices. The E23/PC71BM based device showed an impressively low energy loss, with a value as low as 0.57 eV; accordingly, a high open-voltage (Voc) of 0.88 V was achieved. The low energy loss in the E23-based OSC is related to the increased dipole moment change of E23, which in turn results in low exciton binding energy.
5.4. Electron donors containing double porphyrin segments
It is known that oligoporphyrins can efficiently absorb sunlight in a wide range with high molar coefficients. Dimers usually show a higher efficiency in comparison with monomers.113,114 Porphyrins are well-known for their excellent light-harvesting ability, while hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene is supposed to have good charge transport characteristics. In order to take advantage of the properties of both materials, Wong et al. synthesized two porphyrin–hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene–porphyrin donors (F1 and F2, Fig. 15).115 These two donors were fabricated with PC61BM; F1 showed an efficiency of 1.20% that is higher than that of zinc-containing F2 (0.87%). Their low efficiencies in solution-processed solar cells can be explained on the basis of de-metallation of metallated porphyrins in solution and/or in acidic media.116 There is no electron-deficient group in the backbones of F1 and F2, and thus Sharma et al. used the electron-deficient π-conjugated group triazine to connect with porphyrin units (F3, Fig. 15). Generally, triazine derivatives have been extensively studied as electron-transporting and hole-blocking layers. F3:PC71BM (1:1) showed an efficiency of 2.91% without any pretreatment, and it increased to 4.16% with the addition of pyridine (3% v/v).117 Langa et al. reported the synthesis of the D–A–D donor (F4, Fig. 15),92 and the F4:PC71BM device showed a high efficiency of 8.03%. This higher efficiency was due to the high FF and Jsc resulting from the low energy loss, the balanced charge transport and the optimized morphology of the blend.
 Fig. 15  The chemical structures of electron donors with double-porphyrins. 
Peng et al. designed three porphyrin dimers, F5, F6 and F7, (Fig. 15) bridged with diethynylene, diethynylene–dithiophene and diethynylene–phenylene, respectively.118 These three donors with PC61BM as the acceptor showed much higher PCEs of 4.5% (F5), 5.5% (F6) and 6.42% (F7), respectively. They further extended their studies and synthesized F8 (Fig. 15) using the ethynylene bridge. The optimized F8-based BHJ OSC showed absorption up to 1000 nm with EQEs of 66% and 32% at 780 and 900 nm, respectively. It showed a high PCE of 8.45% with a Jsc of up to 19.65 mA cm−2, which is the best performance of the electron donor with double porphyrins.
In 2016, Chen et al. synthesized two porphyrin dimers (F9 and F10, Fig. 15) bridged with ethynyl or butadiyne, which have the molecular architecture of porphyrin–π–porphyrin (F9) or porphyrin–π–π–porphyrin (F10).113 This architecture might not be promising because there are only electron-rich groups and the optoelectronic properties are difficult to modulate. The two donors fabricated with PC71BM showed PCEs of 1.24% (F9) and 1.73% (F10). Its efficiency can be further improved to 2.03% when the F10 blend was processed from a mixed solvent of 3% v/v 1-chloronaphathalene (CN) in o-DCB. Intrinsic hole mobilities of F9 and F10 are 4.5 × 10−4 and 6.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The higher intrinsic carrier mobility of F10 is due to the longer π-conjugation bridge.
Therefore, it is better to link two porphyrin units using electron-deficient groups. As already reported, molecules with repeating electron-rich units showed a low efficiency due to the poor film morphology and insufficient absorption of the solar spectrum.121 From Table 6, it is clear that the donors (F3, F4, F5, F6, F7 and F8) with an electron-deficient group showed a better performance as compared to the molecules that have no electron-deficient groups (F1, F2, F9 and F10). The molecules having no electron-deficient units showed very low Jsc and FF values. F3, F4, F5, F6 and F7 have an appropriate combination of electron-rich and electron-deficient groups. The D–A structural framework generally lowers the band-gap and provides a uniform film morphology.

However, there are also unexpected examples. Matsuo et al. synthesized diporphyrin polymers (F11 and F12, Fig. 15) linked with an electron-withdrawing 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole unit and used them in OSCs.120 These polymers showed Soret bands at 474 and 794 nm and Q-bands at 754 and 771 nm, respectively. The OPV performance of F11 and F12 was unsatisfactory (1.95 and 1.57%, respectively).
5.5. Electron donors with multiple porphyrins
It is generally accepted that some materials with 3D architectures showed better performance than their planar counterparts122 due to the multi-directional charge-transport,123 which successfully worked with spherical fullerenes and perylene diimide (PDI) non-fullerene small molecules.
Thamyongkit et al. synthesized a porphyrin–triazine compound (G1, Fig. 16) (triazine central unit connected to three porphyrins). In this design, the porphyrin works as a light-harvesting antenna, while the triazine acts as a charge extraction promoter.124G1:PC61BM with a ratio of 1:10 showed a PCE of 0.5%. Sariciftci et al. prepared a similar compound G2 (Fig. 16); triphenylamine (TPA) was introduced instead of the triazine as TPA has a special propeller star-burst molecular structure because of the sp3 hybrid orbital of the nitrogen atom. However, a poor PCE of 0.4% was obtained.125 TPA is an excellent electron-donor group and extensively used in dyes for DSSCs. As the TPA and the porphyrin are both electron-rich units, there will be less chances of charge transfer. Energy level mismatch is another reason for the low efficiency of the G2 based device.

Coutsolelos et al. also developed a triazine-bridged porphyrin donor G3126 (Fig. 16). This is an asymmetrical molecule having two meso-phenyl-substituted Zn–porphyrins and one free-base mesityl-substituted porphyrin with a terminal meso-4-carboxyphenyl group. BHJ OSCs based on G3:PC71BM (1:1) gave a PCE of 2.85%; their performance was further improved to 3.93% with the addition of 1-CN (5% v/v). Structurally, G1 and G3 are not much different; one can wonder why they showed different results. This difference in PV performance can be explained on the basis of energy level match with the acceptors. The HOMO and LUMO values of G3 were found to be −5.63 and −3.55 eV, respectively, while the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PC70BM were −6.2 and −3.95 eV; the difference in the LUMO energy levels of the donor and acceptor is 0.47 eV. This situation is suitable for efficient electron–hole dissociation.127 In the case of G1, the energy difference in the LUMOs of the donor and the acceptor is 0.7 eV; this is too high, and there might be less chance of electron–hole dissociation. Also, balancing the effect of CN/THF solvent mixture on the charge-transporting properties might be an additional reason for the enhanced Jsc and PCE values of the G3 based device (Table 7).

6. Porphyrin-based small molecules as electron acceptors
Porphyrin-based semiconductors have been widely reported as electron donors in BHJ OSCs.18 In particular, a series of molecules with porphyrin as a core and electron-deficient units as end groups have been developed to create materials with broad absorption in the visible and NIR regions.5,12,89,99,104 The incorporation of these materials as electron donors has resulted in an increased PCE of 9%.93 The outstanding performance of porphyrin-based electron donors has also intrigued researchers to develop electron acceptors.
In 2011, Wang et al. reported a porphyrin–fullerene dyad128 (H1, Fig. 17). It showed a PCE of 3.35% that is slightly lower than that of PCBM (4.03%) when using the same donor (SiPCPDTBT). The FF in the case of H1 was 34% lower than that for the PCBM based device. However, much higher values for both Jsc and Voc indicated higher potential for further optimization. Later in the same year, the same group reported a similar porphyrin–C60 dyad (H2) with an additional bulky 3,5-bis(dodecyloxy)benzyloxycarbonyl group on the C60 moiety to fine-tune intercolumnar C60–C60 interactions (Fig. 17).129 With a low band-gap polymer of PCPDTBT as the donor, it showed a PCE of 3.36%. In 2014, Therien et al. synthesized a porphyrin molecule end-capped with isoindigo (H3, Fig. 17). This molecule showed absorption spectra up to 800 nm and aligned energy levels with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), consequently providing an initial PCE of 0.57% when used in OSCs.130
 Fig. 17  Chemical structures of porphyrin-based small molecules as electron acceptors. 
Before 2017, the development of porphyrin-based electron acceptors was disappointing and their efficiencies were low. Their low performance may come from different reasons: the electron donating nature of porphyrin, mismatch between donor and acceptor energy levels and lack of optimal morphologies.
In 2017, Li et al. did a very important breakthrough, and they realized a PCE of 7.4% by using a porphyrin-based electron acceptor.131 They used two design principles: (1) porphyrin is an electron-donating unit, so it is necessary to introduce strongly electron-deficient units to create low-lying energy levels that are close to those of fullerene derivatives132 and (2) the aromatic porphyrin tends to aggregate into large domains that are detrimental to charge generation,133 but can be reduced in size by introducing functional groups that create steric hindrance.134 On the basis of these considerations, they designed H4 (Fig. 17), which has four perylene diimide (PDI) units connected at the meso-positions of a porphyrin ring through ethylnyl groups. This molecule showed absorption from 300 to 850 nm. This study will motivate the scientific community to pay more efforts in this field. Very recently, Hadmojo et al. reported an n-type porphyrin-based acceptor (H5, Fig. 17).135 A narrow band-gap of 1.27 eV and NIR-harvesting resulted from extended π-conjugation and intramolecular charge transfer between the strong electron-donating PZn core and the electron-accepting PDI wings. The PTB7-Th:H5 device exhibited a PCE of 5.25% with a remarkably low Eloss of 0.54 eV. The PCE of H5 is lower than that of H4 which contains four PDI groups. As mentioned above, porphyrin is a strong electron-donating unit, and thus the presence of four PDI electron-deficient groups in H4 makes it a good acceptor for OSCs. In addition, Li et al. also designed and synthesized a new star-shaped porphyrin-based molecule (H6, Fig. 17), with four rhodanine (R) and benzothiadiazole (BT) groups used as electron-deficient units. The PDPP5T:H6 device showed a relatively low efficiency of 1.9%.136 Based on the above results, we can conclude that the strong electron-deficient end-capped groups are necessary for balancing the strong electron-donating nature of porphyrin (Table 8).

7. Porphyrin sensitizers for ternary blends
The efficiency of OSCs still needs to be improved for their commercialization. A simple strategy to enhance the light harvesting ability is using ternary organic solar cells, where one donor and two acceptors (or two donors and one acceptor) are used to fabricate the active layer. Initially, it was thought that a third component just acts as a sensitizer. After strong investigation, many results reveal that the ternary combination also has a significant impact on the film morphology and the charge transport pathway.137 Thus, ternary blends provide a potential pathway toward higher photovoltaic performance, while maintaining the simplicity of processing single junctions.138–141 By blending a complementary absorber, the Jsc can be increased. This concept has been explored to a limited extent so far, mostly due to the complications associated with achieving an optimal active layer morphology. Porphyrins are attractive light-harvesting molecules due to their high extinction coefficients.
Porphyrin is an appropriate candidate for ternary blend OSCs due to its excellent light-harvesting ability. Belcher et al. used different porphyrins (I1–I10, Fig. 18) as light harvesters, initiators of primary charge separation, and/or charge carriers in ternary blend OSCs.141–145 They have tested two types of devices ((MEH–)PPV:PC61BM and P3HT:PC61BM). The results indicate that porphyrin broadened the absorption range, contributed to the photocurrent generation and initiated primary charge separation. The Sessler group tested different metalloporphyrin-oligothiophene compounds (I11–I19, Fig. 18) as sensitizers for P3HT:PC61BM BHJ OSCs. These compounds have one or two meso-substituted terthiophene and different metals in the center.146 Weight ratios of 1–10% were tried, and noticeable changes were observed in the efficiency and output parameters. Cu-based porphyrins (I14 and I19) showed the best results, while their free-base counterparts (I11 and I16) gave the lowest performance. On a general basis, the effectiveness of these sensitizers was increased in the following order of 2H < Co < Zn < Ni < Cu. This indicates the importance of the central metal.
 Fig. 18  Porphyrin sensitizers for ternary blend OSCs. 
Peng et al. reported the fabrication of ternary blend OSCs, D2–D4 (Fig. 13), and PTB7 served as the donor while PC71BM was used as the acceptor. A relatively higher PCE of 8.39% was obtained147 as compared to the binary OSCs based on PTB7:PC71BM (7.23%).148 Basically, the ternary film showed absorption in a wide spectrum which makes the absorption of more photons possible, resulting in higher values of current. Also, the three materials showed cascade LUMO energy levels. By virtue of the above factors, ternary OSCs acquired a larger Jsc value of 17.22 mA cm−2 as compared to 14.99 mA cm−2 for the binary one.
The inspiring results of D2 in ternary OSCs encouraged them to use D5 (Fig. 13) in ternary OSCs. D5 in combination with PBT7 and PC71BM showed record-breaking results. A high efficiency of 11.03% resulted from higher values of the Jsc and FF. The ternary device showed a hole mobility of 3.41 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is much higher than that for the PTB7 binary control device without D5 (8.86 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). In sum, the synergic optimization of electronic properties and light absorption is responsible for high performances of ternary OSCs.89
Although PCE is mostly considered as a very important parameter by researchers, thermal stability is also very important, especially for the large-scale fabrication and practical application. It is observed that the stability depends on the photo-degradation of organic materials, the morphological stability of blends and interface material issues. Porphyrins can interact with other compounds like fullerenes and form complexes through van der Waals forces or π–π interactions.149 They are widely used in photovoltaic devices as photosensitizing agents. It was hypothesized that porphyrins could interact with fullerenes and increase the thermal stability of the device. Yang selected zinc-5,15-diethynyl-10,20-di(4-dodecy-loxyphenyl)porphyrin to demonstrate this novel strategy in the P3HT:PC61BM:I23 (Fig. 18) ternary system.150 Addition of I23 increased the thermal stability but showed a negative effect on the efficiency. Still the effect of porphyrin chemical structure on the thermal stability remains unclear. The decrease of the PCE needs to be stopped. The same group tested a series of porphyrins (I24–I30, Fig. 18). First, they theoretically simulated and then performed a morphological stability study. It was found that I23, which is –NO2-substituted and Cu-metallized, was the most promising candidate to improve the thermal stability while maintaining a higher PCE. This porphyrin selection strategy was successfully used for P3HT:PC71BM.
Recently, Langa et al. fabricated a ternary organic solar cell using E4, E23 as the donor and PC71BM as the acceptor.151 The E4:E23:PC71BM (0.2:0.8:2) based device showed an efficiency of 9.44%. The ternary organic solar cells showed higher values of incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency across the entire wavelength region when compared to their binary counterparts.
8. Porphyrin-based interlayers
We know that the interfaces between electrodes and the active blend layer play a vital role in improving the device performance by decreasing barriers for charge collection. Some research groups realized the utilization of porphyrin materials as interfacial layers. In 2012, Lemmetyinen et al. used a doubly linked porphyrin–fullerene dyad (J1, Fig. 19) as an interlayer between P3HT:PC61BM and a tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminum (Alq3) layer,152 which improved the PCE from 1.8% to 2.6%. The authors argued that electron transfer from the porphyrin macrocycle to C60 enhances the built-in electrical field and consequently increases Voc simultaneously.
 Fig. 19  Porphyrin-based interlayer materials. 
In 2014, Vasilopoulou et al. used self-assembling porphyrin nanostructures (J2 and J3, Fig. 19) as the interfacial materials for OSCs based on P3HT:PC61BM.153 The efficiency increased from initial 2.6% to 4.8% and 3.6% with the addition of J2 and J3, respectively, where J2 adopted a face-to-face molecular orientation parallel to the substrate, while J3 self-assembled with the edge-to-edge molecular orientation. The findings of this study indicate that the molecular orientation of the buffer layer could largely affect the photovoltaic performance.
In addition, Zhang et al. synthesized two kinds of alcohol/water-soluble porphyrins (J4 and J5, Fig. 19) and utilized them in PCDTBT:PC71BM based OSCs.154 These devices showed improved PCEs as compared to those without interlayers. The highest PCE of 6.86% was achieved for the device with J5 as the interlayer. Porphyrin forms permanent dipoles at the interface between the metal electrode and the active layer. It can obviously improve the Voc and charge extraction, and sequentially lead to the increase of the PCE.
The Peng group also synthesized a water/alcohol soluble porphyrin (J6, Fig. 19) in which two amino-functionalized fluorenes are connected to the porphyrin core via ethynylene linkages. Two remaining terminal positions of the porphyrin are filled with 3,4-bis-[2-(2-methoxy-ethoxy)-ethoxy]-phenyls.155 They used it as a cathode interfacial layer for PTB7/PC71BM and PTB7-Th/PC71BM-based BHJ OSCs and showed PCEs of 8.52% and 9.16%, respectively. The same group used J7 (Fig. 19) as a cathode interfacial layer for PTB7/PC71BM and achieved an improved PCE of 8.09% (Voc = 0.75 V, Jsc = 15.20 mA cm−2, and FF = 70.94%).156 These preliminary results demonstrate that suitably functionalized porphyrins are very promising cathode interfacial materials.
9. Conclusion and summary
Porphyrin, as a synthetically tractable analogue of chlorophylls, has the merits of extensively π-conjugated systems, fast electron transportation, high absorption coefficients and tunable optoelectronic properties. There are different ways to modify the porphyrin macrocycle, such as substituting with different peripheral groups, or even fusing porphyrins with other aromatic molecules, or forming porphyrin oligomers. Being the natural choice and successful candidates in the DSSC field, porphyrin materials have a bright future in OSCs. There are numerous options to design excellent porphyrin-based materials and perform various functions in OSCs.
For porphyrin polymers, it is a large challenge to realize relatively high PCEs, mainly due to the low charge mobility. In recent years, the attention of the scientific community has been directed toward small molecules. Structural modification on periphery is a common method, while the change of the metal center is rare. At present, small-molecule donors with the A–π–D–π–A configuration showed the best performance. Such tremendous success is due to extensive use of the dye molecular design that emerged from the evolution of DSSCs. Surprisingly, the mechanisms of DSSCs and OSCs are different but ideas for their molecular design are similar somehow. Still, a wider pool of porphyrinoid photosensitizers tested in DSSCs are worth using in BHJ OSCs.
Porphyrin-based polymers and small molecules mostly work as the electron donor because of their excellent electron-donating ability. In general, monomeric porphyrins showed a better performance as compared to dimers and trimers, although there are also limited samples based on porphyrin dimers with a promising photovoltaic performance.
In recent years, scientists have tried to design electron acceptors by using strong electron-deficient groups to balance the electron-donating ability of porphyrin. The PCEs were inferior in the early stage but they have sharply jumped to 7.4%. This quick success results from the extensive testing of the push–pull configuration.
Porphyrins are also successfully used as photosensitizers for ternary OSCs. They increased the light-harvesting ability, removed the defects of binary OSCs, and resultantly improved PCEs. Porphyrins also showed a positive effect on the thermal stability of ternary OSCs. The success of porphyrins in OSCs as multidimensional materials inspired researchers to test them as interlayer materials to improve device performance. In most cases, up to 50% improvement of PCEs could be observed. Basically, the interlayer decreases the barriers for charge collection. In recent years, the photovoltaic performance and the role of porphyrins have been increasing. However, a few obstacles still have to be removed.
It is well accepted that 15% PCE is the theoretical value for the commercialization of OSCs. A maximum efficiency of 8% for binary OSCs, 11% for ternary OSCs and 12% for tandem OSCs were obtained, when porphyrins were used as donors. While the device with the porphyrin-based acceptor showed a maximum efficiency of 7.4%, it still needs further improvement.
Reducing Eloss is another challenging issue in OSCs. A maximum Voc of 0.99 V was obtained for porphyrin-based photovoltaic materials; it can still be improved by an appropriate energy match between the donor and the acceptor. However, there are still no clear guidelines to solve this issue.
The hole mobilities for most porphyrin-based materials were much higher than electron mobilities, resulting in unbalanced charge transport which is responsible for the low efficiency. Even though the PCEs have exceeded 9%, the inferior device stability still remains a great challenge. There are a few possible reasons such as diffusion of electrodes and buffer layers, metastable morphology, stress from environmental factors (mechanical stress, irradiation, heating, oxygen and water).
In 2016, Roncali et al. reviewed the synthetic complexity of some representative molecular donors. They have estimated the scalability (complexity index) on the basis of several parameters such as the number of synthetic steps, the reciprocal yield of each step, the number of operations required for the purification and the safety characteristics of the used chemicals. On the synthetic complexity index (SC), porphyrin-based donors stand after 70. For future commercialization, the synthetic complexity and the cost of porphyrin-based materials need to be reduced.
Hopefully, the scientific community will cover some drawbacks in this field. We believe that porphyrin-based materials will play an important role in the colorful future of OSCs.
