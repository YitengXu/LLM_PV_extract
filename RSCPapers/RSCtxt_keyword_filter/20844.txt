    , Accepted 2nd November 2018First published on 5th November 2018AbstractNon-fullerene organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted significant attention recently due to their tremendous advances in power conversion efficiency (PCE). It has been found that most non-fullerenes are small molecule acceptors (SMAs) bearing electron-rich cores of polycyclic arenes. However, these polycyclic arenes have a high synthetic cost. Here, a novel strategy is proposed to construct SMAs using simple and weakly electron-deficient thiazolothiazole (TTz) as the core. Two simple-structured SMAs of TTz1 and TTz2 with an A(π–A′–A′′)2 framework are designed and synthesized for potential applications in OSCs, in which benzothiadiazole and malononitrile derivatives are employed as a dual electron-accepting (A′–A′′) arm. Their optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic performances are systematically investigated. We find that both TTz1 and TTz2 exhibit decreased LUMO and increased HOMO energy levels in comparison to the prototypical small molecules TT0 and TTz0 bearing a single electron-accepting (A′′) terminal end. Medium optical bandgap of about 1.60 eV and satisfactory energy levels are obtained for both molecules TTz1 and TTz2 with more balanced carrier mobility by introducing a novel TTz core and tuning the A′–A′′ arm. The highest PCE value of 8.77% is recorded in TTz1-based OSCs blended with the common electron-donating material J71, which is the highest efficiency among OSCs using simple-structured SMAs as non-fullerenes to date. This study reveals great potential to construct high-efficiency and simple-structured SMAs using a weakly electron-deficient TTz core instead of an electron-donating polycyclic arene core.
Introduction
Non-fullerene small molecule acceptors (SMAs) have been widely applied in organic solar cells (OSCs) to replace traditional fullerene derivatives in recent years due to their advantages such as strong light absorption ability, high morphological stability and easily tuned properties.1–6 With the emergence of efficient SMAs and meticulous morphology control, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs based on a blend of polymer donor and SMA have advanced to over 14%.7–12
These SMAs mostly consist of an electron-rich core of polycyclic arene and two strong electron-withdrawing terminal groups, which have an A–D–A framework and can form a planar backbone to facilitate carrier transport and enhance absorption.13–17 By tuning the electron-rich core of polycyclic arenes, the resulting SMAs exhibit significantly improved PCE values in OSCs. These polycyclic arenes mainly contain tricyclic fluorene,18–20 tetracyclic indenoindene,21 pentacyclic indacenodithiophene (IDT),22–24 hexacyclic thiophenethieno[3,2-b]thiophene-thiophene (4T),25 heptacyclic indacenodithieno[3,2-b] thiophene (IDTT),26–28 octacyclic tris(thienothiophene) (3TT),29 or nonacyclic 6,6,12,12-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-indacenobis(dithieno[3,2-b;2′,3′-d]-thiophene).30 However, the syntheses of multiple cyclic cores with complicated structures require multiple steps, which results in high cost for their practical applications in the photovoltaic field. Hence, developing simple-structured and high-efficiency SMAs is urgent and necessary for the application of OSCs.
Recently, a strategy was proposed to develop simple-structured SMAs using “decreased fused-ring” and “non-fused ring” as cores for high-efficiency OSCs.31–33 With intramolecular non-covalent interactions between the non-fused ring core and the lateral π-bridged unit, some SMAs exhibited better photovoltaic properties. For example, Li and co-workers introduced O⋯H and S⋯H non-covalent interactions to obtain simple SMA of Ph-IC and showed PCE of 5.68% in OSCs.32 Chen and co-workers used F⋯H non-covalent interactions to construct another SMA of DF-PCIC and realized PCE as high as 10.12% in a DF-PCIC-based device.33 Interestingly, these central cores are mostly electron-rich aromatic units in the reported SMAs. However, using a simple electron-deficient fused ring as the core to construct SMAs has rarely been reported.
In this contribution, we primarily employ weakly electron-deficient thiazolothiazole (TTz) as the core to construct simple-structured SMAs with an A(π–A′–A′′)2 framework. Our motivation is that the TTz unit exhibits a rigid planar structure and has higher polarity than the thienothiophene (TT) unit, which can extend the π-electron system and promote π-stacking for the resulting molecules.34 On the other hand, by theoretical calculations, we find that the prototypical small molecule TTz0 has lower HOMO and LUMO energy levels than TT0. When another electron-withdrawing benzothiadiazole unit is inserted into TTz0 near the 2-methylene malononitrile terminal, the resulting TTz1 exhibits narrower band-gap and more balanced carrier mobility than TTz0. In comparison with TTz1, TTz2 using 2-(3-ethyl-5-methylene-4-oxothiazolidin-2-ylidene)malononitrile instead of 2-methylene malononitrile exhibits high HOMO and LUMO energy levels. Therefore, both molecular structures of TTz1 and TTz2 are designed and depicted in Chart 1. Our experimental results show that the TTz core and A′–A′′ arm have important influence on optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic performances for SMAs. Medium optical band gaps from 1.60 to 1.65 eV are observed with strong absorption from 300 to 770 nm. Introducing the TTz core and tuning the A′–A′′ arms can efficiently decrease band gap and shift energy levels, which match the values of the common electron-donating material J71, i.e., poly[5,6-difluoro-2-(2-hexyldecyl)-4-(5-(6-methyl-4,8-bis(5-(tripropylsilyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophen-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-7-(5-methylthiophen-2-yl)-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole]. For these optimized OSCs, the TTz1:J71-based device exhibits better photovoltaic properties than the TTz2:J71-based device. The maximum PCE of 8.77% is obtained for the TTz1:J71-based device, which is 1.4 times higher than that for TTz2:J71-based device. A relationship between molecular structures and photovoltaic properties is established. This study provides a new strategy to develop simple-structured SMAs by introducing simple electron-deficient TTz as the core. Furthermore, this type of SMA should have potential applications in non-fullerene acceptors and high-efficiency OSCs.

2 Results and discussion
2.1 The feasibility analysis of design strategy
The geometric structures of two prototypical molecules (TT0 and TTz0) with short π–A′′ arms and two designed molecules (TTz1 and TTz2) with expanded π–A′–A′′ arms in their neutral states are optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G(d, p) level.35,36 In all calculations, we take into account the solvent effect using a conductor-like polarizable continuum model (C-PCM) with chloroform solvent.37 All calculations are carried out in Gaussian 16 code.38 The results show that small molecule TTz0 (2.02 × 10−3 D) exhibits a larger dipole moment than the small molecule TT0 (1.79 × 10−3 D) when the TT unit is replaced with TTz unit. Furthermore, the molecule TTz0 has deeper HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energy levels than TT0 (Fig. 1a). Based on the above finding, we infer that introducing the weakly electron-deficient TTz core is favourable to construct SMAs.

(b) Calculated carrier transfer integrals (hole transfer integral, electron transfer integral) based on dimer structures optimized at B3LYP-D3/6-31G(d, p) level. 
Computational results further indicate that both TTz1 and TTz2 possess more extended backbones and conjugation systems. The theoretical HOMO and LUMO energy levels are −5.59 eV/−3.66 eV for TTz1 and −5.45 eV/−3.50 eV for TTz2. Moreover, the intermolecular electronic coupling values (v) of these small molecules are shown in Fig. 1b, as calculated by the energy splitting in dimer (ESID) method based on the stable dimer configurations of TTz1 and TTz2.39 In general, when the v value is larger, the carrier mobility is higher. Therefore, the molecule TTz1 should have higher electron mobility than other molecules based on the computational results. It is clear that both TTz1 and TTz2 have lower band gaps than TT0 and TTz0, making them more appropriate than both prototypical molecules for use as SMAs.
2.2 Synthesis, characterization and thermal stability
The synthetic routes of TTz1 and TTz2 as well as TT0 and TTz0 are shown in Scheme 1 and S1,† respectively. Thiazolothiazole derivative 2 was synthesized by dehydration–cyclization, and the small molecules TTz1 and TTz2 were synthesized through condensation reactions. Their structures were characterized with 1H-NMR, TOF-MS, and elemental analysis.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic routes of molecules TTz1 and TTz2. 
It is found that TTz1 and TTz2 are soluble in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene, at room temperature. The thermal decomposition temperatures at 5% weight loss are 392 °C and 378 °C for TTz1 and TTz2, respectively, as measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under nitrogen at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 (Fig. S4†). Therefore, TTz1 and TTz2 have adequate thermal stability for use in OSC devices.
2.3 Electrochemical properties
Fig. S5† shows the cyclic voltammogram curves of TTz1 and TTz2 measured by cyclic voltammetry. A redox curve is observed for both molecules. The onset oxidation/reduction potentials (Eox/Ered) are 0.90 V/−0.94 V for TTz1 and 0.70 V/−1.00 V for TTz2. As calculated, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels (EHOMO/ELUMO) are −5.70 eV/−3.86 eV for TTz1 and −5.50 eV/−3.80 eV for TTz2. Observably, terminal A′–A′′ framework has a significant effect on redox behavior for its molecules. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of TTz1 are lower than those of TTz2 due to stronger electron-withdrawing ability of the A′–A′′ armed unit in TTz1. The corresponding electrochemical band-gaps (Eecg) are 1.84 and 1.70 eV for TTz1 and TTz2. Fig. 2b shows the energy diagrams of TT0, TTz0, TTz1, TTz2 and J71. The EHOMO/ELUMO values of TT0 and TTz0 are calculated from their CV results, as shown in Fig. S2.† Given that the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of J71 are −5.40 and −3.24 eV, respectively, both TTz1 and TTz2 exhibit more appropriate energy levels than TT0 and TTz0. A much lower HOMO energy level is not favourable for TT0 and TTz0 for use as acceptor materials in photoactive layers. While inserting another electron-withdrawing unit of BT into the molecule TTz0, we find that both resulting molecules TTz1 and TTz2 exhibit increased HOMO energy levels and decreased LUMO energy levels, which can be tuned to match the energy levels of some typical high-performance polymer donors such as J71, PBDB-T, and FTAZ.40–42 Therefore, both TTz1 and TTz2 can be employed as medium band-gap electron acceptor materials in OSCs.

2.4 Optical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of TTz1, TTz2 and J71 are shown in Fig. 3 and S6.† In chloroform solution (10−6 M), both molecules TTz1 and TTz2 display similar and strong absorption bands ranging from 300 nm to 700 nm. The molar extinction coefficients (εmax) of TTz1 and TTz2 are 6.67 × 104 and 6.28 × 104 M−1 cm−1, respectively. However, no clear aggregation effect is observed in TTz1 and TTz2 dilute o-dichlorobenzene solutions based on their temperature-dependent UV-vis absorption spectra from 20 °C to 80 °C (Fig. 3c and d). The low-lying absorption bands exhibit a slight blue-shift upon increasing temperature due to the increase in disorder.43 In films, the absorption profiles of TTz1 and TTz2 become broad and have significant red shifts (∼80 nm) accompanied with clear vibration shoulder peaks in comparison with the corresponding absorption spectra in solution. This indicates that the intermolecular π–π stacking effect becomes strong in their solid states. Furthermore, TTz1 exhibits a stronger shoulder peak signal relative to TTz2 owing to its better linear structure, which coincides with theoretical calculations. The corresponding optical and electrochemical data are listed in Table 1.

2.5 X-ray diffraction

Fig. 4 displays the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of molecules TTz1 and TTz2. Three clear diffraction peaks (100, 200, 010) are observed for both molecules. Their d-spacing values can be calculated with the Bragg equation according to the 2-theta angle (2θ) of diffraction. It is found that TTz1 and TTz2 prominently exhibit sharp diffraction peaks in the small-angle region at 2θ values of 5.77° and 5.28°, respectively; their corresponding d(001) spacing values are 15.304 Å and 16.723 Å, which indicate lamellar packing for both molecules. A stronger and sharper diffraction peak is observed for TTz1, implying that TTz1 has more ordered lamellar stacking than TTz2. On the other hand, both TTz1 and TTz2 exhibit weak diffraction peaks in the wide-angle region. The d (010) spacings of TTz1 and TTz2 are calculated to be 3.460 Å and 3.488 Å, respectively, which can be ascribed to intermolecular π–π stacking. The π–π stacking distance of TTz1 is shorter than that of TTz2. Therefore, TTz1 has a stronger intermolecular effect than TTz2. More ordered stacking and stronger intermolecular effect are exhibited by TTz1, resulting in better device performance.

2.6 Photovoltaic properties

Fig. 5a shows current density–voltage (J–V) curves of J71:TTz1- and J71:TTz2-based OSCs at optimized process conditions under illumination of AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2; their photovoltaic data are listed in Table 2. The optimized donor and acceptor ratio of J71:TTz1 and J71:TTz2 blends is 1:2, and the doping concentration of DIO is 0.25%. Under these optimized process conditions, the J71:TTz1 devices exhibit PCE of 8.77% with Voc of 0.90 V, Jsc of 15.43 mA cm−2 and FF of 63.18%. The J71:TTz2 devices exhibit PCE of 6.30% with Voc of 0.92 V, Jsc of 12.75 mA cm−2 and FF of 53.73%. Clearly, the J71:TTz1 cells exhibit better device performance than J71:TTz2 cells.

We further note that TTz1 exhibits relatively lower series resistance (Rs) and higher shunt resistance (Rsh) than TTz2. This implies that the J71:TTz1 active layer has better ohmic contact than the J71:TTz2 active layer in the device, which allows the J71:TTz1 devices to achieve higher FF. Fig. 5b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the optimized J71:TTz1 and J71:TTz2 devices. A broad spectral response is observed for both J71:TTz1 and J71:TTz2 devices in the region of 300–800 nm. However, the J71:TTz1 device presents a stronger spectral response from 400 to 800 nm; this is beneficial for increase in the Jsc value for the J71:TTz1 device. Fig. S9† shows photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of the J71 neat film as well as PL spectra of J71:TTz1 and J71:TTz2 blends (1:2, wt/wt) under 592 nm light excitation. A strong emission peak at 648 nm is observed for the J71 neat film. However, the emission peak from the polymer J71 almost completely disappears for the J71 blends with quenching of TTz1 and TTz2. Therefore, charge transfer from donor to acceptor is very efficient.46
2.7 Carrier mobility
The hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) of J71:TTz1 and J71:TTz2 blends were investigated by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method in their hole-only and electron-only devices. The device structures are ITO/PEDOT:PSS (5000 rpm, 140 °C, 5 min)/active layer (DIO: 0.25%, 3000 rpm)/MoO3 (10 nm)/Au (100 nm) for the hole-only devices and Al/active layer (DIO: 0.25%, 3000 rpm)/Al (100 nm) for the electron-only devices. Fig. 5c and d show the J1/2–V plots of the hole-only devices and electron-only devices, respectively. For the J71:TTz2 blend, the calculated μh and μe values are 2.92 × 10−4 and 8.74 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with μh/μe ratio of 3.34. In contrast, for the J71:TTz1 blend, the calculated μh and μe values are 4.24 × 10−4 and 1.46 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with μh/μe ratio of 2.90. Higher carrier mobility and better charge balance of the J71:TTz1 blend are related to denser packing of TTz1, leading to enhancement of photovoltaic performance.
2.8 Morphology and miscibility

Fig. 6 shows the surface phase separation images of J71:TTz1 and J71:TTz2 blend films recorded by atomic force spectroscopy. Relatively smooth morphologies are observed for the J71:TTz1 blend film (root mean square (RMS) roughness of 1.98 nm) and the J71:TTz2 blend film (RMS roughness of 2.14 nm). In particular, after adding 0.25% DIO, a smoother surface with a bicontinuous interpenetrating network is formed for both J71:TTz1 and J71:TTz2 blend films with decreased RMS roughness. As a result, smoother morphology is observed in the J71:TTz1 blend film, which can facilitate exciton dissociation and charge transport, eventually resulting in improvement in their photovoltaic performance.

Generally, the morphology of the active layer is related to the miscibility of acceptors and donor.47 Good morphology is caused by similar surface energies of the polymer donor and acceptors. Fig. 7 shows the contact angles of deionized water (polar liquid) and diiodomethane (nonpolar liquid) on the corresponding thin films, which can help estimate the surface energies of TTz1, TTz2 and J71. The deionized water and diiodomethane contact angles are 91.0° and 33.5° for pure TTz1 film and 87.0° and 37.0° for pure TTz2 film, respectively. Clearly, the TTz2 film exhibits improved hydrophilic property but reduced hydrophobic property in comparison with the TTz1 film. The calculated surface energies of TTz1 (42.79 mN m−1) and TTz2 (41.14 mN m−1) are similar to that of J71 (31.19 mN m−1), indicating that TTz1, TTz2 and J71 have moderate miscibility, which contributes to the formation of satisfactory BHJ morphology.

3. Conclusion
In summary, we have successfully developed a type of SMA constructed with a simple and weakly electron-deficient TTz core. Both SMAs of TTz1 and TTz2 with an A(π–A′–A′′)2 framework exhibit decreased LUMO energy level and increased HOMO energy level in comparison with their prototypical molecules TT0 and TTz0. In contrast to TTz2, TTz1 possesses a more linear and planar backbone, which can lead to much stronger π–π stacking and higher charge mobility. Consequently, the highest PCE of 8.77% is recorded in TTz1-based OSCs. The results suggest that high-efficiency SMA materials can be constructed using a simple and weakly electron-deficient core. This type of simple-structured SMA material with an A(π–A′–A′′)2 framework bearing a weakly electron-deficient core can have potential applications in non-fullerene acceptors and high-efficiency OSCs.

4.2 General measurements

1H NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker Dex-300/400 MHz NMR spectrometer using tetramethylsilane as a reference in deuterated chloroform solution at 298 K. Mass spectra were estimated on a Bruker Autoflex III Mass Spectrometer. Elemental analysis was measured on a Vario EL III elemental analyzer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted under a flow of dry nitrogen gas at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 with a Perkin-Elmer TGA 4000 instrument. UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-1800 PC spectrometer. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted with a CHI630E electrochemical work station dipped in an acetonitrile solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) under nitrogen at room temperature. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was carried out to investigate the crystalline characteristics of two SMA materials by an RINT2000 vertical goniometer operated at 40 kV voltage and 250 mA current with Cu Kα radiation. AFM images were obtained using a Bruker Inova atomic microscope in tapping mode to observe the surface morphologies of the blend films. The surface energies of the pure films were obtained on a Powereach JC2000D1 contact angle tester by measuring the contact angles of DI water and diiodomethane on their surfaces.
4.3 Device fabrication and characterization
Photovoltaic properties of TTz1 and TTz2 were studied by fabricating OSCs based on TTz1 or TTz2 as acceptor and J71 as donor with an inverted device structure of ITO (indium tin oxide)/ZnO/J71:TTz1 or TTz2/MoO3/Ag. The devices were characterized under different processing conditions (D:A ratio and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive, ESI†). The ITO glass substrate was cleaned with deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol. The glass substrate was then dried by high pressure airflow and further treated with UV exposure for 30 min in a UV-ozone chamber. A thin ZnO layer (≈30 nm) was spin-coated onto the ITO substrate at a spinning rate of 6000 rpm for 30 s in dried air followed by baking on a hot plate at 150 °C for 30 min. A chloroform (CF) solution of the active layer with a thickness of ca. 100 nm with different weight ratios of J71:TTz1/TTz2 was spin-coated onto the substrate at 3000 rpm in a glove box. The optimized overall concentration was 15 mg mL−1 with a D:A ratio of 1:2 (w/w) and 0.25% (v/v) DIO. After deposition of the active layer, the substrates were immediately subjected to metal electrode evaporation without any post-treatment. A molybdenum trioxide interlayer (MoO3, 10 nm) and an aluminum anode (Al, 100 nm) were finally deposited onto the surface of the active layer in an evaporation chamber under high vacuum (≤10−6 mbar).48 The J–V characteristics of the solar cells were measured by a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 Source. The light source was calibrated using a silicon reference cell (AK-200, Konica Minolta, Inc.) with an AM 1.5G solar simulator (XES-70S1, SAN-EI) at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. EQE was measured by a Newport QE test Model 77890 (Newport Co. Ltd.) during illumination with mono-chromatic light from a xenon lamp.
