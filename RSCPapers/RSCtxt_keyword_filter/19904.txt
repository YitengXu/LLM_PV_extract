    , Accepted 11th December 2020First published on 15th December 2020AbstractAntimony sulfide (Sb2S3) is a light absorbing material with a strong visible light response, which is suitable for efficient and low-cost photoelectrodes. Nano-structured films have unique advantages for constructing photoelectrodes due to enhanced light absorption and carrier migration. However, on account of the low carrier concentration and carrier diffusion length (30–300 nm) of Sb2S3, finding an effective and low-cost method to grow a uniformly-coated ultrathin overlayer on a three-dimensional Sb2S3 film is the key to improve carrier utilization, and is significant to construct a low-cost photocathode with high efficiency. In this work, we report an Sb2S3-based heterostructure photocathode using nanostructured Sb2S3 as a light absorption layer. After coated with the ultrathin TiO2 layer by a simple electrodeposition method and modified with Pt particles, the Sb2S3-based photocathode achieves a photocurrent density of 2.7 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE in a near-neutral electrolyte, about twelve times higher than that of pure Sb2S3, with an onset potential of +0.55 V vs. RHE. The maximum IPCE of the Sb2S3-based photocathode reaches 17.5% at 700 nm. Our experimental results confirmed the promising application of Sb2S3 as a light absorbing material for photocatalysis, and put forward a facile and effective strategy to coat ultrathin TiO2 on 3D nanostructured films, which will promote further investigation of nano Sb2S3-based photocathodes.
Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a promising and effective method to convert solar energy into hydrogen energy. The utilization of hydrogen can not only solve the problem of fossil energy shortage, but can also play a significant role in environment protection.1,2 The challenge for large-scale application of photocatalytic water splitting is how to prepare photoelectrodes with high efficiency, low cost and long-term stability. Most commonly used photocathode materials are mainly p-type semiconductors such as Cu2O,3–5 Co3O4,6–8 CuInS29–11 and Sb2Se3.12–14 Antimony sulfide (Sb2S3) has emerged as an ideal semiconductor for effective photovoltaic applications in recent years. Sb2S3 is one of the stable one-phase semiconductors with non-toxicity and is widespread on the earth. It is a direct bandgap semiconductor with a bandgap of 1.7 eV,15,16 which can absorb light up to 730 nm, covering most of the visible spectrum, and has a high optical absorption coefficient (α ≈ 105 cm−1),17 showing unparalleled light absorption capacity. According to the band gap of Sb2S3, the calculated theoretical photocurrent density is 24.5 mA cm−2, and the corresponding theoretical STH efficiency is about 28%.18 Furthermore, the conduction band of Sb2S3 is about 0.2 V negative of the HER potential, and thus can effectively drive the hydrogen evolution reaction. According to current reports, when low-cost narrow bandgap semiconductors such as Sb2Se3 are used as a photocathode light-harvesting material, they usually face the problem of low onset potentials due to small band gaps. W. Yang et al. reported a spin coating-prepared Sb2Se3 photoelectrode coupled with TiO2 with an onset potential of 0.2 V vs. RHE13, while Li Zhang's group showed that thermal evaporation-processed Sb2Se3 coated with CdS and TiO2 achieved an onset potential of 0.4 V vs. RHE.19 The onset potential is related to the flat band potential.20 The flat band potential is the electrode potential when the electrode is in the flat band state, which is related to the band energy difference between the valence band and the HER potential. Sb2S3 has a favorable energy band position with a valence band lying 1.55 V positive of the hydrogen production potential,21 corresponds to a higher theoretical onset potential. In our previous work, the Sb2S3-based thin film photoelectrode prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has obtained an onset potential of +0.50 V vs. RHE.18
Since Sb2S3 was first used as a light-absorbing material in solar cells in 2010 by Hodes's group,22 it has made considerable progress in the photovoltaic area.23–27 Choi's group28 conducted sulfurization with thioacetamide (TA) on a Sb2S3 film prepared by chemical bath deposition (CBD), and obtained a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.75% after constructing Sb2S3/TiO2 heterojunction. Kim et al.29 deposited a highly uniform Sb2S3 layer by atomic layer deposition (ALD), followed by heat-treatment in a H2S atmosphere, and achieved a PCE of 5.77%. In addition, there are a variety of methods for Sb2S3 film preparation, such as sputtering,30 spray pyrolysis,31 thermal evaporation,32,33 and chemical vapor deposition.18 As is known to all, nanostructured films have unique advantages in constructing photoelectrodes. The electrical and optical performance of the photoelectrode will be greatly improved due to the improvement of light absorption and carrier migration.34,35 At the same time, a larger surface area means more reactive sites35,36 and cocatalyst loading.37,38 The nanostructured film prepared by the solution method has the simultaneous advantages of simple operation, low cost, convenience for large-scale industrial applications, and high photoelectric conversion efficiency. H. Lee et al. prepared Sb2Se3 nanorod arrays by spin coating, with copper-doped NiOx as the hole selection layer, and achieved a photocurrent of 17.5 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE.39
In the design of the photoelectrode structure, heterojunction construction of three-dimensional light-absorbing films is a challenging but an important topic. On the account of the low carrier concentration and carrier diffusion length (30–300 nm) of Sb2S3,40,41 a heterojunction layer uniformly coated on nanostructured Sb2S3 is the key to improve carrier utilization. Traditional physical vapor deposition (PVD) methods such as sputtering and evaporation are not suitable for surface deposition of three-dimensional complex structures due to the presence of sputtering shadow areas. While with chemical vapor deposition (CVD), it is difficult to achieve precise control of the thickness and high film uniformity. W. Yang's group deposited a thin TiO2 layer by ALD on the surface of Sb2Se3 nanorod arrays prepared by spin coating, and achieved a photocurrent of 10 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE.13 However, ALD is an expensive and highly technically demanding method, and it is difficult to realize large-scale industrial applications.
In this work, we use a simple hydrothermal method to prepare nanostructured Sb2S3 as the light absorbing material of the photocathode for water splitting. Sb2S3 shows a morphology of network microspheres with thin nanosheets interconnected on the surface. In addition, a convenient electrodeposition method was used to successfully deposit an ultra-thin layer of TiO2 on three-dimensional structure Sb2S3 to construct an effective heterojunction. The photocurrent density of the electrode coated with TiO2 is about 1.1 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE in a near-neutral electrolyte, about four times higher than that of pure Sb2S3. After noble metal modification, the photocurrent density increased to 2.7 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE, and the onset potential reached +0.55 V vs. RHE, which is the highest onset potential of currently reported Sb2S3-based photocathodes. Our experimental results are of indispensable significance for the research of efficient and low-cost Sb2S3-based photocathodes.
Experimental
Synthesis of the Sb2S3 film on ITO glass
The Sb2S3 film was prepared using ITO glass as a substrate by a simple hydrothermal method. The size of ITO glass was 1 × 2 cm2, and it was cleaned ultrasonically with acetone, ethanol and deionized water for 20 min successively, and then preserved in ethanol. In a typical experiment, we dissolved 1.336 g C8H4O12K2Sb2·3H2O in 50 ml deionized water and stirred it for 5 min. After that, we added 0.6 g C2H5NS and continuously stirred until it turned into a clarified light-yellow solution. Then the ITO glass substrates were vertically inserted into a Teflon shelf. The 50 ml solution and the shelf were transferred into the reactor. After 12 hours of insulation at 150 °C, samples were rinsed with deionized water and alcohol, and reserved after thorough desiccation.
Preparation of Sb2S3/TiO2 heterostructure photoelectrodes
The TiO2 film was prepared by cathodic electrodeposition using a three-electrode system. Firstly, 0.66 ml TiCl4 was added drop by drop into 19.34 ml methanol in an ice bath under magnetic stirring to obtain a colorless and transparent solution after releasing abundant gas. Then we slowly added 12.25 ml 30% hydrogen peroxide ([H2O2:Ti4+ = 20:1]) to obtain a dark orange precursor. Then solution was reserved in a refrigerator for 72 hours. After thoroughly aging, 1.6 ml precursor was added into a mixture of 45 ml methanol and 15 ml deionized water in an ice bath as electrolyte. The sample acted as the working electrode. A standard Ag/AgCl electrode and a Pt wire acted as the reference electrode and the counter electrode respectively. The process was carried out in an ice bath. The deposition parameters are −0.5 mA cm−2 for current density and 500 s for the time. Samples were then rinsed with deionized water and ethanol to remove the attached electrolyte and other impurities such as Cl−. After natural drying, the electrodes were annealed at 300 °C in an argon flow for 30 min.
Deposition of a Pt cocatalyst on Sb2S3/TiO2 electrodes
Eventually, a thin layer of Pt particles was sputtered on the surface using an E-1060 ion sputtering system. The deposition parameters are 16 mA for current and 40 s for time.
Materials characterization
The surface and section morphology of the electrode was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; S-4800, Hitachi). Cross-section element analysis measurements were carried out by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI F20) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The lattice structure was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), using a Bede D1 system with Cu Kα radiation. The valence band (VB) curve of the sample was obtained by X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) measurements, which were carried out on a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer; the radiation source is monochromatic Al Kα (1486.6 eV). UV-vis absorption spectra were converted from diffuse reflectance spectra measured using a UV-vis spectrometer (Shimadzu 3600). Photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) tests were performed on a Edinburgh instruments (FLS920).
PEC measurements
PEC properties were characterized using a conventional three-electrode cell system equipped with a flat quartz glass window, using a Pt wire as the counter electrode, a standard Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode and a Sb2S3 based photoelectrode as the working electrode. The light source is a 300 W Xe lamp and an AM1.5 filter was used to simulate the solar spectrum. The light intensity was adjusted to 100 mW cm−2 using an optical power and energy meter (Thorlabs PM100D). All PEC measurements were performed in electrolyte with a solute of 0.2 M Na2SO4, 0.09 M KH2PO4 and 0.01 M K2HPO4. The pH was adjusted to 6. Tests were carried out using an electrochemical workstation (CHI760E). The measured potential of the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) is calculated using the Nernst equation. The formula is as follows:ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.0591 × pH + 0.197 V
Different filters are superimposed on the Xe lamp to obtain the photocurrent under monochromatic light irradiation, and the incident photon current efficiency (IPCE) of the photoelectrode is calculated using the formula as follows:  In which λ represents the wavelength of the incident light, Jlight and Jdark represent the corresponding current density with or without illumination, respectively. Plight represents the energy density of the corresponding incident light. The faradaic efficiency (FE) for the hydrogen product was calculated according to the following equation FE (%) = mol products × the number of electrons needed for conversion/moles of electrons passed × 100%.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted at a potential of 0 V vs. RHE; the scanning frequency range was 104–10−2 Hz, and the AC amplitude was 10 mV. Current–potential curves measured by Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV) are all recorded under 0.25 Hz chopping illumination with a scan rate of 0.01 V s−1 and a sample interval of 0.001 V. The Mott–Schottky curve is recorded using the impedance–potential (IMPE) with an amplitude of 0.01 V and a frequency of 500 Hz.
All potentials were referenced to RHE.
Results and discussion
The schematic diagram of the preparation route of an ITO/Sb2S3/TiO2 photocathode is shown in Fig. 1. Sb2S3 thin film photoelectrodes were prepared by a hydrothermal method in a Teflon-lined steel autoclave reactor at 150 °C for 12 hours. As shown in Fig. S1,† the color of Sb2S3 turned into black from red after annealing. The morphology and composition of the films were characterized by SEM and XRD measurements, respectively. Fig. 2a–c show the SEM images of Sb2S3 prepared at different precursor concentrations. All samples are island nucleation mode. As the concentration of the precursor increased gradually, the morphology of the film transformed from a network into microspheres. The blades of a 30 mM electrode are more even but shallower, while a 40 mM-electrode has deeper and more developed blades.

 Fig. 2  (a–c) SEM images of Sb2S3 films with different precursor concentrations; (d) XRD patterns of these samples (* marked as the diffraction peak of ITO). 
The XRD patterns in Fig. 2d show the diffraction peaks of three different samples. All the patterns show sharp diffraction peaks, indicating that they all exhibit good crystallinity. The annealed Sb2S3 sample has an orthorhombic crystalline phase structure. Except for the diffraction peaks of the ITO layer, relatively obvious diffraction peaks are located at 2θ values of 15.65°, 17.54°, 24.90°, 29.27°, 32.38° and 35.54°, corresponding to the [020], [120], [130], [211], [221], and [240] facets of Sb2S3 (JCPDS no. 42-1393), respectively. Notably, the XRD spectra of films prepared by different precursor concentrations are almost identical, with no obvious change in peak intensity or orientation, indicating that different concentrations only affect the morphology rather than the internal crystalline state.
The current–potential curves of pure Sb2S3 photoelectrodes prepared with different precursor concentrations are shown in Fig. 3a. The photocurrent density of the photoelectrode deposited at 40 mM reaches up to 0.2 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE, significantly higher than others. We speculate that it mainly profits from the special morphology. The 40 mM photoelectrodes have more developed blades, and thus light can be reflected multiple times between the leaves and completely absorbed by the film.9 Optical performance was characterized using a UV-vis spectrophotometer. Fig. 3b shows the optical absorption curves of photoelectrodes prepared with different precursor concentrations. It is clear that the light absorption of the 40 mM photocathode is stronger than that of others. The result is entirely consistent with photocurrent density and fits our speculation. The inset in Fig. 3b shows the Tauc plot converted from the UV absorption spectrum. The intersection point of the tangent of sharp rising region and x axis is the band gap of the sample. It can be concluded that the band gaps of 30 mM, 40 mM and 50 mM samples are about 1.66 eV, 1.69 eV and 1.68 eV, respectively.

Through comprehensive consideration, it was determined that the optimal precursor concentration of Sb2S3 was 40 mM of antimony tartrate (C8H4O12K2Sb2·3H2O) and 80 mM of thioacetamide (C2H5NS). Fig. 4a shows sectional SEM image. The Sb2S3 film is uniformly covered on the surface of ITO, and the thickness of the absorption layer is about 809 nm. Fig. 4b shows the VB curve of Sb2S3 in XPS measurements. The intersection point between the tangent of the sharp rising zone and the x axis is the distance between the valence band and Efb. We can deduce from the VB curve that the valence band is 0.85 eV positive of Efb. Fig. 4c shows the Mott–Schottky curve of Sb2S3 at an AC amplitude of 500 Hz. Efb determined by the intercept method is 0.5 V vs. RHE. Sb2S3 exhibits weak n-type conductivity. The Fermi level is close to the middle of the forbidden band. In addition, a certain bias is applied during system operation, so it also can be used for the preparation of photocathodes. Therefore, based on the above experiments and measurements, it can be calculated that Sb2S3 has a conduction band edge at −0.24 V vs. RHE and a valance band edge of +1.35 V vs. RHE. Its forbidden band spans the reduction potential of hydrogen and the oxidation potential of oxygen. The band structure of Sb2S3 is shown in Fig. 4d.

Subsequently, a TiO2 film was deposited on the surface of Sb2S3 by electrodeposition. The growth parameter of the final selected TiO2 is −0.5 mA cm−2 for current density, and 500 s for time, according to the current–potential curve shown in Fig. S2.† When current density is constant, the thickness of TiO2 is proportional to the deposition time. According to Fig. S2a,† as the deposition time increases, PEC performance deteriorates. We speculate that this is because a large number of carriers recombine in the body of TiO2. And when TiO2 is thicker, recombination will be much severe, resulting in a decrease in photoelectric response capability. EIS tests were shown in Fig. S3,† and it was found that charge transfer resistance increases as the deposition time increases. This result verified our guess. Therefore, on the basis of ensuring uniformity and integrity, the thickness of TiO2 should be as thin as possible. The TiO2 film has two main functions. The first is to form a heterojunction with Sb2S3, constructing a space charge region to derive the photogenerated carriers, and the second is to coat the surface to prevent direct contact between Sb2S3 and electrolyte, thus improving the stability of the photocathode. Finally, Pt particles were sprayed on the surface of the photocathode as a cocatalyst by sputtering. Fig. 5a shows a sectional TEM image of the photocathode. The thicker Pt layer on the right side of the map is deposited by electron beam and ion beam deposition during FIB in order to protect the electrode. We further conducted energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) to obtain elemental distributions. From Fig. 5b–e, we discovered that an ultrathin TiO2 layer is grown on the surface of Sb2S3, and the thickness is less than 10 nm.

The photoelectrochemical performance of different photoelectrodes can be characterized by current–potential curves shown in Fig. 6a. The photocurrent density of pure Sb2S3 can reach 0.25 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE after adjusting the experimental parameters, indicating good optical response ability. After coated with TiO2, the photocurrent density increases to 1.1 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE, about four times that of a pure Sb2S3 photoelectrode. The photocurrent density reached 2.7 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE after sputtering Pt particles. Fig. 6b shows local amplification from 0.28 V to 0.55 V of the current–potential plot. It can be seen that the onset potential of the pure Sb2S3 photoelectrode is 0.35 V vs. RHE, and increased to 0.44 V vs. RHE after loading TiO2. The onset potential further increases to 0.55 V vs. RHE after sputtering Pt cocatalyst. Enhancement of the onset potential indicates that the establishment of the heterojunction and the loading of the cocatalyst have successfully increased the driving force of electron transfer from the photocathode to the electrolyte, which is more competitive in the construction of unassisted solar water-splitting devices in the future.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to further determine the reasons for the improvement of photoelectrochemical performance. The diameter of the semicircle in the high frequency part of the Nyquist plot equals to the charge transfer resistance of the photoelectrode. The Nyquist curve of different photoelectrodes under AM 1.5G illumination is shown in Fig. 6c. The illustration is the simulation circuit diagram. The results show that the photoelectrode resistance after loading the TiO2 overlayer is obviously smaller than that of pure Sb2S3 photoelectrode, while after sputtering Pt, the resistance further reduced significantly. This indicates that the introduction of the TiO2 layer has successfully formed heterojunction with Sb2S3, thus promoting the separation of photogenerated carriers and increasing the speed of carrier transfer. The modification of the Pt cocatalyst can also rapidly capture photogenerated electrons and improve the reduction rate of water. To test the stability of the photocathode, we performed a 30 min current–time response test on the Sb2S3/TiO2/Pt photocathode at 0 V vs. RHE in a near-neutral electrolyte. The result is in Fig. 6d. After 30 min of testing, the photoelectrode maintains ∼80% of the initial photocurrent, about 2 mA cm−2.2 The electrode shows an obvious attenuation of photocurrent in the first 5 min and then tends to stabilize. Compared to the current–time response of pure Sb2S3 tested under the same conditions shown in Fig. S4,† the photocurrent density after 30 min testing showed an improvement from 35% to 80%, which indicates the stability enhancement through device fabrication. After the current–time response, we continued a H2 revolution test on the same electrode. The evolved hydrogen gas product is quantified by gas chromatography (GC) to estimate the faradaic efficiency of the Sb2S3-based photocathode. The result shows a faradaic efficiency of about 99% in Fig. S5.† And the photocurrent shows no obvious attenuation after the first 30 min of testing.
As shown in Fig. 7a, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy is used to study the mechanism of light-induced carrier recombination and separation in semiconductors. The PL emission near 500–600 nm can be attributed to radiative recombination of defective in-gap states.42 Compared with pure Sb2S3, the PL emission of Sb2S3/TiO2 is weaker, revealing the effective heterogeneity between Sb2S3 and TiO2, in which photogenerated electrons on the conduction band of Sb2S3 are transferred to TiO2, and the photogenerated holes in TiO2 are transferred to Sb2S3. This heterojunction improves the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers, thereby obtaining better PEC performance. In order to better determine the lifetime of carriers in different samples, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy was used to measure the decay time of different samples. The PL decay curve for each sample was well fitted by a triple-exponential function:  
 Fig. 7  (a) PL emission spectra and (b) TRPL spectrum result of different samples measured at room temperature with 405 nm wavelength excitation. 
From Fig. 7b and the inset table, the carrier lifetime of the Sb2S3/TiO2 sample is longer than that of pure Sb2S3, indicating the effective separation and transfer of carriers at the heterojunction interface, thereby improving the PEC performance.
Then we performed incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) tests on this photocathode under simulated solar light irradiation at 0 V vs. RHE. The IPCE value in Fig. 8 shows a slow upward trend from 380 nm to 700 nm and peaked at 700 nm, with a maximum IPCE value of about 17.5%. And then it falls sharply from 700 nm and dips to its lowest value at 800 nm, which perfectly corresponded to the UV absorption curve shown in Fig. S6† of this electrode.
 Fig. 8  IPCE of the Sb2S3/TiO2/Pt photocathode. 

Fig. 9 shows the schematic diagram of band matching and the reaction process of the Sb2S3/TiO2/Pt photocathode. The Fermi level of Sb2S3 is close to the middle of the band gap, which indicates that Sb2S3 is a weak n-type semiconductor with a low carrier concentration, while the Fermi level of TiO2 is close to the conduction band, which indicates that TiO2 is a strong n-type semiconductor with a high carrier concentration. Therefore, when two phases are balanced, a small part of the space charge region is distributed inside TiO2, and most of the area is distributed in Sb2S3, which can conduct the photogenerated electrons deep in Sb2S3 in time. Since the Fermi energy level of Sb2S3 locates at a more positive potential than that of TiO2, at equilibrium, from the interface to the inside of Sb2S3, the energy band bends upward, and from the interface to the inside of TiO2, the energy band bends downward, as shown in Fig. 9, which forms a space electric field pointing from TiO2 to Sb2S3. Under the action of the space electric field, the photogenerated electrons are conducted from the conduction band of Sb2S3 to the conduction band of TiO2. Since the energy of electrons is higher than redox potential of hydrogen, the electrons are conducted from electrode surface to electrolyte, and hydrogen ions in the electrolyte are reduced to produce hydrogen. At the same time, holes are conducted to the counter electrode through the wire, and under the action of applied bias voltage, hydroxide ions in electrolyte are oxidized to generate oxygen, which maintains the connection of entire circuit.

Conclusions
To sum up, we prepared a heterostructure photocathode using nano-structured Sb2S3 as light absorption layer and modified with TiO2 and Pt particles. The Sb2S3/TiO2/Pt photoelectrode shows excellent photoelectrochemical performance. The photocurrent reaches 2.7 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE, about ten times that of pure Sb2S3. The TiO2 overlayer is the most significant reason for the enhancement of photoelectrochemical conversion ability. Most of the space charge region fall deep into Sb2S3 due to the formation of the ultrathin TiO2 layer, promoting the separation of photogenerated carriers. The loading of Pt cocatalysts can also capture photogenerated electrons in time, which greatly improves the electron transfer speed. Overall, for the first time, nano-structured Sb2S3 prepared by a solution method is used as an absorption material of photocathodes for photocatalytic water splitting, which has put forward the promising application prospect of nanostructured Sb2S3 in the photoelectrochemical field.
