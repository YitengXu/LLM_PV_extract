    , Accepted 19th April 2013First published on 23rd April 2013AbstractHierarchical macroporous Zn2SnO4 consisting of nanoparticles has been synthesized for the first time through an in situ hydrothermal and a following annealing process in the presence of a polystyrene (PS) template. Zn2SnO4 macropore sizes are tuned in the range of 180–650 nm by selecting the appropriate size of PS spheres, and the building unit size of the Zn2SnO4 macropore is 4.2 nm regardless of the PS sizes. The photovoltaic performances of the dye-sensitized solar cell based on hierarchical macroporous Zn2SnO4 with 200, 400, 600 and 750 nm PS spheres are 5.01, 4.76, 4.39 and 3.92%, respectively. The smaller pore size of Zn2SnO4 exhibits higher photovoltaic performance, which is ascribed to the higher dye loading, faster electron transport rate and slower electron recombination rate. These are confirmed by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy, intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The double layered photoelectrode based on a Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles dye adsorption layer (4.2 nm in particle size, 15 μm in film thickness) and a macroporous light scattering layer (180 nm in macropore size, 4.0 μm in thickness) shows a remarkable enhancement in power conversion efficiency (6.10%) compared to that of Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles photoelectrode (5.36%) because of its superior light scattering ability.
1 Introduction
The morphology, size and structure of a material significantly influence its physical and chemical properties, which determine its potential applications.1 Hence, a number of endeavours have been focused on the control of these factors of materials in the past decades. Hollow structures have shown various applications in catalysis, adsorption, separation, drug delivery, microreactors, Li-ion batteries, and solar cells because of their low density, high surface-to-volume ratio and high light-harvesting efficiency.2–5 Several strategies have been successfully applied to fabricate the hollow structures including hard template (carbon, silica, polymer spheres, and metal nanoparticles),6–9 soft template (gas bubbles, oil droplets, macromolecules, micelles, and microemulsions)10–14 and template-free (Ostwald ripening, Kirkendall diffusion) methods.15–17
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have become one of the most promising candidates for the traditional p–n junction silicon solar cell because of their relatively high power conversion efficiency, and low cost for their materials and production.18,19 Since the great breakthrough made in 1991 by O'Regan and Grätzel, the power conversion efficiency has made significant enhancement through the optimization of the photoanode, dye and electrolyte. The photoanode material is well known as the carrier for dye adsorption and the transport route for the injected electron from the excited dye to the conduction band of semiconductor oxides (e.g. TiO2), which remarkably influence the power conversion efficiency of DSSCs. Various morphologies including nanoparticles,20,21 one dimensional nanowires, nanorods, nanofibers, nanotubes,22–28 two dimensional nanosheets, nanoribbons,29,30 three dimensional microspheres,31,32 octahedra,33,34 flowers,35,36 or hollow spheres37 and nanoarrays38–40 have been variously synthesized and found to influence the dye loading, electron transport and recombination and hence the photovoltaic performance.
Among these morphologies, although the hollow sphere based photoelectrode has shown a lower power conversion efficiency due to its low surface area, the several advantages of this structure may compensate for this deffect, and this has driven great interest over the past years. In the hollow sphere structure, ordered networks can offer fast electron transport paths and ordered macropores can enhance light scattering, facilitate penetration of the electrolyte solution, and promote mass transport, especially for the ionic liquid, gel or polymer based quasi- or solid state electrolyte with a high viscosity. A typical nanoparticle (10–30 nm) based electrode often limited the efficiency of such an electrolyte due to its insufficient filling resulting from the small pore size between adjacent particles.41–48
Zn2SnO4, one of the most important ternary oxide semiconductors, has a tunable work function and band gap energy by simply varying the relative Zn/Sn ratio. More importantly, Zn2SnO4 possess a wide band gap of 3.6 eV (TiO2: 3.2 eV) and large electron mobility of 10–15 cm2 V−1 s−1 (TiO2: 0.1–1.0 cm2 V−1 s−1) implying superior properties for decreasing dye photobleaching, by the UV region of the solar spectrum, and fast electron transport.49,50 Compared to the ZnO that decrease the photocurrent and photovoltaic performance by forming a Zn–dye complex, Zn2SnO4 shows excellent stability in acid media as well.51 According to these significant advantages, Zn2SnO4 could be one of the promising photoanode materials for DSSCs. Since the initial report of Zn2SnO4 as a photoanode,52,53 several researches on Zn2SnO4 focusing on the nanoparticle or nanowires for DSSCs or QDSSCs (quantum dot sensitized solar cells) have been reported recently.54–60 Although a hollow structure is a desirable photoelectrode, due to the excellent advantages mentioned above, to date, there is no report on the synthesis of Zn2SnO4 with hollow structure and their application in DSSCs.
Herein, we for the first time demonstrate the synthesis of macroporous Zn2SnO4 with tailorable hollow size based on an in situ hydrothermal process under the assistance of a PS sphere template. During the hydrothermal process, SnCl4·5H2O and Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, the precursors form Zn2SnO4 nanocrystals which in situ coat on the PS surface and lead to the hierarchical macroporous Zn2SnO4 hollow sphere after the removal of the PS template via annealing. The size tailored Zn2SnO4 hollow spheres (180, 375, 550, and 650 nm) were investigated as photoanodes in DSSCs which showed tunable electron transport and recombination, light scattering over a wide visible-light range, and good power conversion efficiency. The DSSC based on a double layered Zn2SnO4 photoelectrode with 4.2 nm NP layer (15 μm) and 200 nm Zn2SnO4 macropore scattering layer (4 μm) showed an extremely high power conversion efficiency of more than 6%.
2 Experimental
2.1 Chemicals and materials
The chemicals, including SnCl4·5H2O, Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, 1,2-propylene glycol, diethanolamine, styrene, potassium persulphate and ethanol etc., were A. R. reagents and used as received without further purification. The fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glasses were cleaned ultrasonically with diluted acid, ethanol, acetone and water for 5 min, respectively, and then dried in air.
2.2 Preparation of PS spheres
PS spheres were used as templates and synthesized in an emulsifier-free system.61 Typically, the polymerization reactions were carried out in an 1000 mL round-bottom three-necked flask. 670 mL of distilled water were added to the flask and a magnetic stirrer with a diameter of 3.5 cm was put into the water through one outlet. A water-cooled condenser was placed at the second outlet, a dropping funnel connected to the third outlet for adding reactants, then the flask with nitrogen-bubbled water was immersed in an oil bath, keeping the temperature at 70 ± 1 °C. After stirring for 10 min under N2 flow, 73 g styrene was added through the dropping funnel into the flask. Waiting for another 15 min, 50 mL 2.76 × 10−3 mol L−1 potassium persulphate acting as initiator was dropped into the solution via the funnel. After 24 hours in a thermostatic state with stirring and N2 atmosphere, 750 nm PS lattices were obtained. Other sizes of PS spheres were synthesized following the same procedure with different conditions. 200 nm PS: 95 ± 1 °C, 0.29× 10−3 mol L−1 potassium persulphate, 42 g styrene. 400 nm PS: 95 ± 1 °C, 2.76 × 10−3 mol L−1 potassium persulphate, 73 g styrene. 600 nm PS: 70 ± 1 °C, 1.8 × 10−3 mol L−1 potassium persulphate, 73 g styrene.
2.3 Synthesis of macroporous Zn2SnO4 and Zn2SnO4 NPs
In a typical synthesis of hierarchical Zn2SnO4 macropores, 0.008 mol Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, 0.004 mol SnCl4·5H2O and 16 mL diethanolamine was dissolved in a mixed solvent of deionized water (16 mL) and 1,2-propylene glycol (32 mL) in a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, then 16 mL PS solution was added to this solution under vigorous stirring, which was continuously stirred for another 30 min. Subsequently, the autoclave was sealed and put into an electronic oven, maintained at 200 °C for 24 hours. When the reaction was finished, the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature naturally. The resulted precipitates were collected by centrifuging at 5000 rpm for 5 min and washed 3 times with absolute ethanol and distilled water in an ultrasonic cleaning bath for 5 min, respectively, and finally dried at 60 °C for further characterizations. After drying, the powders were calcinated at 500 °C for 1 h at a rate of 2 °C min−1 to obtain the final products for further characterizations. For comparison, the synthesis of Zn2SnO4 NPs was also done in the absence of PS solution, while keeping other experimental conditions constant.
2.4 Preparation of Zn2SnO4 paste
1.0 g hierarchical macroporous Zn2SnO4 or NPs samples were stirred for 24 h in the mixture of 8.0 mL ethanol, 0.2 mL acetic acid, 3.0 g terpineol and 0.5 g ethyl cellulose to form a slurry, and then the mixture was sonicated for 5 min in an ultrasonic bath, to finally form a viscous white Zn2SnO4 paste.
2.5 Fabrication of the Zn2SnO4 based photoelectrode
The hierarchical macroporous Zn2SnO4 paste was screen-printed on the FTO glass with a film thickness of ∼15 μm. For the double layered photoelectrode: 4.2 nm Zn2SnO4 nanoparticle paste was firstly screen-printed onto the FTO glass with thickness of 15 μm, and then 180 nm macroporous Zn2SnO4 paste was screen-printed on the Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles underlayer as a light scattering layer (4.0 μm in thickness). The Zn2SnO4 films were gradually heated under air flow at 325 °C for 5 min, at 375 °C for 5 min, at 450 °C for 15 min, and then at 500 °C for 15 min. The hierarchical macroporous Zn2SnO4 films were immersed into a 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min and washed with water and ethanol, then sintered at 520 °C for 30 min; after cooling down to 70–80 °C, the fabricated Zn2SnO4 electrodes were immersed into acetonitrile–tert-butanol (volume ratio 1:1) containing N719 dye (Ru[LL′-(NCS)2], L = 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid, L′ = 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-ditetrabutylammonium carboxylate, 5.0 × 10−4 M, Solaronix Co.), and was kept for 24 h at room temperature.
2.6 Fabrication of Zn2SnO4 sensitized solar cells
The Pt-coated FTO glass as a counter electrode was prepared by dropping H2PtCl6 (5.0 × 10−4 M) solution on the FTO glass followed by heating at 400 °C for 15 min in air. The electrolyte composition is 1-propyl-3-methyl-imidazolium iodide (PMII, 0.6 M), LiI (0.05 M), I2 (0.03 M), guanidine thiocyanate (GuNCS) (GSCN, 0.1 M, Aldrich), and 4-tert-butylpyridine (t-BP, 0.5 M, Aldrich) in acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15 v/v). The active area of the dye-coated Zn2SnO4 film was 0.160 cm2.
2.7 Characterizations
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) was applied to characterize the phase of the products. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JSM-6330F) was applied to investigate the size and morphology. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were performed on a JEOL-2010 HR transmission electron microscope to further determine the intrinsic structure. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore-size distribution of the hierarchical macroporous Zn2SnO4 and nanoparticles were measured using an ASAP 2010 Surface Area Analyzer (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation). The thickness of the Zn2SnO4 film was measured by using a profilometer (Ambios, XP-1). A Shimadzu UV-3150 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer was used to measure the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrum. The current–voltage characteristics were performed using a Keithley 2400 source meter under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2) provided by a solar simulator (91192, 1 kW Xe lamp, Oriel). The incident light intensity was calibrated with a NREL-calibrated Si solar cell. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) signal was recorded on a Keithley 2000 multimeter under the illumination of a 150 W tungsten lamp with a Spectral Product DK240 monochromator. Intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) and intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) were characterized on an electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Zennium) with a frequency response analyzer under modulated blue light emitting diodes (457 nm) driven by a Zahner (PP211) source supply. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed with a Zennium electrochemical workstation (Zahner) at bias potential of −0.70 V in the dark with the frequency ranging from 10 mHz to 1 MHz.
3 Results and discussion
The size of the PS spheres varied from 200 to 750 nm through the optimization of the experimental conditions (see the Experimental section). FE-SEM images (Fig. S1†) show the diameters of PS spheres are 200, 400, 600 and 750 nm. The Zn2SnO4-nanocrystal-coated PS spheres were synthesized via in situ hydrothermal reaction in the precursor solution containing Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, SnCl4·5H2O, 1,2-propylene glycol, diethanolamine and an appropriate size of PS emulsion. As an example, an FE-SEM image (Fig. S2†) of the sample prepared in the presence of a 200 nm PS sphere shows that the diameter (∼240 nm) of the PS@Zn2SnO4 nanocrystal is significantly larger than that of an individual PS sphere (200 nm). The removal of the PS template by annealing the as-prepared PS@Zn2SnO4 nanocrystal lead to the formation of hierarchical Zn2SnO4 macropores consisting of small-size Zn2SnO4 nanocrystals.

Fig. 1 shows the formation process of the hierarchical Zn2SnO4 macropore. In a typical synthesis, polystyrene spheres were added to a mixed precursor containing Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, SnCl4·5H2O, diethanolamine, deionized water and 1,2-propylene glycol. During the hydrothermal process, carboxylate groups of the PS interact with Zn2+ and Sn4+ ions and initiate the growth of Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles which probably link with carboxyl groups of PS. Interestingly, the in situ growth of Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles on the surface of the PS leads to a PS@Zn2SnO4 nanocrystal core@shell structure. Subsequent calcination treatment of the PS@Zn2SnO4 nanocrystal to remove the PS spheres leads to the formation of hierarchically macroporous Zn2SnO4 consisting of nanoparticles.

Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. 2) of the samples prepared without PS, with PS, and annealing the PS@Zn2SnO4 clearly show all the samples have a cubic structure of Zn2SnO4 (JCPDS Card no. 24-1470) with cell constants of a = b = c = 8.657 Å, implying a highly crystalline structure. The average particles sizes calculated from the XRD for the Zn2SnO4 NPs were ∼4.2 nm.

Fig. 3 shows the FE-SEM and TEM images of the four different sizes of hierarchical macroporous Zn2SnO4. Clearly, the macropore sizes of the four samples I, II, III and IV based on PS spheres of 200, 400, 600 and 750 nm are 180, 375, 550 and 650 nm, respectively, which experienced a slight decrease after the removal of PS hard template during the calcination process compared with the as-prepared PS@Zn2SnO4 nanocrystal. TEM images (Fig. 3 and S3†) show all the macroporous Zn2SnO4 composed of small-sized Zn2SnO4. For the samples I, II, III and IV, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (inset in Fig. 3e–h, lower right) of the samples show reflection rings corresponding to the (311) and (440) planes, indicating an individual macroporous Zn2SnO4 is polycrystalline. The inset HRTEM images in the corresponding TEM images reveal that the building units of the macropore are single-crystal Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles with same size of ∼4.2 nm regardless of size variation of the PS. These particles were well crystalline, as shown by the clear lattice fringes (d400 = 0.261 nm) for all the samples.

Insets are the corresponding high-magnification FE-SEM images. (e–h) are the corresponding TEM images. Upper insets: HRTEM images of Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles from different sizes of macroporous Zn2SnO4. Lower insets: the corresponding diffraction patterns. 
The four different sizes of macroporous Zn2SnO4 were screen-printed onto the FTO glass and used as a photoanode for DSSCs. The macroporous Zn2SnO4-based photoanodes were further immersed in a TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min, which formed a TiO2 shell layer on the macroporous Zn2SnO4. The photocurrent density–voltage curves of DSSCs based on the macroporous Zn2SnO4 photoelectrode with four different pore sizes are shown in Fig. 4, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters such as Jsc (short-circuit current density), Voc (open-circuit voltage), FF (fill factor) and η (power conversion efficiency) are summarized in Table 1. The efficiency was found to decrease from 5.01 to 4.76, 4.39 and 3.92% along with the diameter of macroporous Zn2SnO4, which varies from 180 to 375, 550 and 650 nm, respectively. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE), defined as the number of electrons generated by light in the external circuit divided by the number of incident photons, is plotted as a function of excitation wavelength, which shows a maximal value at 530 nm decreases with increasing macropore size (Fig. 4b). This trend can be ascribed to the higher dye loading for the smaller macropore size, which is consistent with the Jsc and η. In addition to the dye loading, the light scattering can influence the transport behavior of light via changing the path and/or extending the distance of light travelled within the photoanode film, and thus improve the light-harvesting efficiency, which leads to the enhancement of the photovoltaic performance. The evaluation of the light scattering ability can be characterized by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Fig. 4c shows the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the four different sizes of hierarchically macroporous Zn2SnO4 films. The reflectance increases with the larger macropore size indicates its stronger light scattering ability, implying that larger size macroporous Zn2SnO4 could maximize the use of solar light and hence enhance the light harvesting efficiency and Jsc.

The specific Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and pore size distribution of the different sizes of hierarchically macroporous Zn2SnO4 obtained from the N2 adsorption–desorption measurements are shown in Fig. 5 and summarized in Table 1. The surface area decreases with the larger size of macropore, varying from 101.2, 93.9, 90.6 to 82.4 with the macropore size of 180, 375, 550 and 650 nm. The pore diameter distribution and pore volume don't show significant changes for the different sizes of Zn2SnO4 macropores. The different surface area of the hierarchical macroporous Zn2SnO4 leads to the fact that the dye amounts decrease with the larger pore size shown in Table 1, obtained from the UV-vis absorption measurement of the desorped dye solution from the hierarchical Zn2SnO4 macroporous photoelectrode. The higher dye loading may result in the more utilization of the solar spectrum and thus enhanced Jsc and η.

Intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity-modulated voltage spectroscopy (IMVS) have been widely used to characterize the electron transport properties of the injected electron in a photoanode film and the recombination reaction with redox species in electrolyte. The IMPS and IMVS curves of the DSSCs based on four different sizes of hierarchical macroporous Zn2SnO4 measured under different light illumination are shown in Fig. 6. The time constant of electron transport (τd) is derived from the IMPS data measured under a short circuit according to the following expression: τd = 1/2πfd(1)where fd is the characteristic frequency minimum of the IMPS. Fig. 6a clearly shows that the τd of the DSSCs based on smaller sized macroporous Zn2SnO4 is smaller than that of the larger sized Zn2SnO4 photoanode film suggesting the former has faster electron transport rate compared to that of the latter. Furthermore, for all macroporous Zn2SnO4-based photoelectrode films, the τd decreases (or the electron transport increases) with increased light intensity, which is attributed to the fact that the deep traps are filled by more photoelectrons generated at higher light intensity, resulting in electron trapping/detrapping at in shallower levels.62 The electron recombination time (τr) between the electron in the conduction band of Zn2SnO4 and I3− in the electrolyte can be obtained by IMVS measured at an open circuit according to the following equation (Fig. 6b): τr = 1/2πfr(2)where fr is the characteristic frequency minimum of the IMVS imaginary component. The longer lifetime of the DSSCs based on smaller sized macroporous Zn2SnO4 compared to those of larger size is in agreement with the larger Voc for the former. The τr (electron lifetime) decrease with increasing light illumination can be ascribed to a larger recombination probability owing to more electrons in the conduction band.

According to the electron transport time (τd) and lifetime (τr) we can further obtain another important photovoltaic parameter, electron collection efficiency (ηcc):63,64 ηcc = 1 − τd/τr(3)

Fig. 6c shows the electron collection efficiency of the DSSCs based on four different size hierarchical macroporous Zn2SnO4 based photoelectrodes, which shows that the ηcc of smaller size macroporous Zn2SnO4-based cell is much superior to that of the larger size Zn2SnO4-based cell under various light intensities (Fig. 6c). Hence, the larger ηcc for smaller size macropore Zn2SnO4 is responsible for the higher Jsc.
Furthermore, the electron effective diffusion length (Ln) in the photoanode film suggests whether the injected electron can transport to the external circuit, which influences the Jsc and η. The Ln can be obtained following the equation: Ln = (Dn × τr)1/2(4) Dn = d2/(4 × τd)(5)where Dn is the electron diffusion coefficient, and d is the film thickness. The electron diffusion coefficient of the DSSCs increases with the decreased macroporous size of Zn2SnO4 (Fig. S4†). Hence, based on the Dn (Fig. S4†), τr (Fig. 6b) and eqn (4), the electron effective diffusion length of the DSSCs based on smaller size macroporous Zn2SnO4 is superior to those of larger sizes Zn2SnO4 (Fig. 6d), implying an even thicker film for smaller size macroporous Zn2SnO4-based photoanode can be used to further improve the Jsc and η. As an example, the detailed IMPS and IMVS parameters (τd, τr, Dn, Ln, and ηcc) of DSSCs based on different sized macroporous Zn2SnO4 measured under a light intensity of 150 W m−2 are summarized in Table 2. Based on the discussions above, the faster electron transport rate, slower electron recombination rate and superior dye loading for the smaller size Zn2SnO4 macropores compared to the larger size ones are responsible for the enhancement of power conversion efficiency.

Furthermore, the transport time, electron diffusion coefficient, charge collection efficiency, and effective diffusion length versus the photoelectron density are plotted in Fig. S5,† which show all of these parameters of the smaller sized macroporous Zn2SnO4 are superior to the larger sized macroporous Zn2SnO4. The electron recombination time vs. open-circuit voltage also reveals that the smaller sized macropore has longer lifetime compared to the larger sized one. The trend is similar to Fig. 6 and S4.†
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a steady state method to measure the current response to the application of an ac voltage as a function of the frequency, which has been widely used to investigate the kinetics of electrochemical and photoelectrochemical processes. The Nyquist plots of the EIS of the DSSCs based on different sizes of hierarchically macroporous Zn2SnO4 are shown in Fig. 7, which provide additional information and deeper understanding of the interfacial reactions of photoexcited electrons occurring in DSSCs. The first small semicircle in the frequency range of 1 kHz to 1 MHz corresponds to a charge-transfer resistance and the capacitance should be ascribed to the process at the redox electrolyte–Pt counter electrode interface, showing a similar value for the four DSSCs because of the same electrolyte and counter electrode as the present system. The second large semicircle in the lower frequency range (0.1–1 kHz) is ascribed to the recombination resistance and chemical capacitance across the Zn2SnO4–redox electrolyte interface. The recombination resistance decreases with the increasing macropore size. The electron lifetime values derived from the curves fitting are 185.65 ms, 136.58 ms, 112.59 ms and 102.09 ms for I, II, III and IV, respectively. The longer electron lifetime observed for a smaller macropore size indicates a more effective suppression of the back reaction of the injected electron with the I3− in the electrolyte and is reflected in the improvements seen in the photovoltage. The trend of the electron lifetime obtained from the EIS is also consistent with the IMVS data above.

The aforementioned IMPS, IMVS and EIS revealed the smaller pore size showed faster electron transport and smaller electron recombination, which can be mainly ascribed to the following two factors, though the smaller pore Zn2SnO4-based photoelectrode with higher surface area may also increase recombination sites between the photoelectrode and electrolyte. First, the dye loading increases with decreased pore size of the macroporous Zn2SnO4, resulting in a larger electron density, and deeper traps become filled with increasing electron density hence trapping/detrapping events occur more frequently in shallower traps, leading to faster transport rate and lower recombination.65 Secondly, compared to the large pore Zn2SnO4, smaller pore Zn2SnO4 photoelectrodes possess a larger contact area and improved adherence between the Zn2SnO4 and FTO surface, which not only provide more electron pathways from the Zn2SnO4 film to the FTO glass, but also decrease the recombination between the electron on FTO glass and redox in the electrolyte.
As comparison, the Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles were also prepared via the hydrothermal process in the absence of PS spheres. XRD (Fig. 2) and TEM (Fig. S6†) show the particle size is about 4.2 nm, suggesting the PS sphere doesn't influence the growth of Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSCs based on 4.2 nm Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles with different thicknesses are shown in Fig. S7† and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S1.† The Jsc varies from 4.79 mA cm−2, 7.29 mA cm−2, 9.07 mA cm−2 and 11.05 mA cm−2, with film thickness increases from 6.0 μm, 8.9 μm, 12.2 μm to 15.0 μm, accompanied by an increasing amount of adsorbed dye. The Voc decreases with the increasing film thickness, due to the augmentation of the surface area providing additional charge-recombination sites and enhancing the dark current. The η of the solar cells increases from 2.54% to 5.36% and then decreases to 4.67% with the variations of film thickness. Though the light scattering ability, electron transport rate and electron diffusion coefficient of the hierarchically macroporous Zn2SnO4 photoelectrode is superior to that of the nanoparticle-based photoelectrode, the power conversion efficiency (5.36%) of 4.2 nm Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles (15 μm in thickness) is a little bit higher than that of the 180 nm macropore Zn2SnO4 photoelectrode (5.01%, 15 μm in thickness) because the dye loading of the former (34.91 × 10−8 mol cm−2) is lower than the latter (40.91 × 10−8 mol cm−2). In order to use the bifunctional property of the Zn2SnO4 nanostructure, namely dye adsorption and light scattering, a double layered photoelectrode consisting of 4.2 nm Zn2SnO4 nanoparticle (15.0 μm in thickness) and 180 nm Zn2SnO4 macropore (4.0 μm in thickness) was designed for DSSC application. The J–V curve of the DSSC based on the double layered Zn2SnO4 photoelectrode (15-μm thick Zn2SnO4 nanoparticle + 4-μm thick macropore with a size of 180 nm, Fig. S8†) indicates that the Jsc of 13.06 mA cm−2 is much higher than that of the 19.1-μm thick Zn2SnO4-nanoparticle-based photoelectrode (9.99 mA cm−2). Finally, the power conversion efficiency of the double layered photoelectrode based DSSC reaches 6.10%, which has a 30.6% enhancement compared to the 19.1 μm Zn2SnO4 nanoparticle (4.67%). It is worth noting that the present 15.0 μm Zn2SnO4 nanoparticle photovoltaic performance (5.36%) is much higher than the reported value (4.7% based on 8 nm Zn2SnO4 nanoparticle)54 because of higher dye loading for the smaller size (4.2 nm), and TiCl4 treatment which forms a TiO2 shell on the surface of Zn2SnO4. The conduction band (CB) potential of the TiO2 is more negative than the Zn2SnO4, which facilitates electron flow from the TiO2 to the Zn2SnO4 and inhibits electron recombination between the electron in the CB of Zn2SnO4 and I3− in the electrolyte, resulting in a longer electron lifetime, and hence increases the Jsc, Voc and Jsc.66,67 Furthermore, more than 6% power conversion efficiency for the macroporous Zn2SnO4 based double layered photoelectrode is the highest value for ternary oxide photoelectrodes reported to date. Further optimization of the thickness and size of macroporous Zn2SnO4 may potentially enhance the photovoltaic performance.
4 Conclusions
A PS sphere template assisted in situ hydrothermal method has been developed to prepare hierarchical macroporous Zn2SnO4 materials for the first time. The initial formation of Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles coating onto the surface of the PS sphere leads to core@shell PS@Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles; further removal of the PS template via calcination results in the formation of hierarchical macroporous structures consisting of Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles. FE-SEM, TEM and HRTEM results reveal the walls of hierarchical macropores are composed of 4.2 nm Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles regardless of the PS sphere diameter. Four different macropore sizes of Zn2SnO4 have been obtained by selecting PS spheres with a diameter of 200, 400, 600 and 750 nm. The power conversion efficiencies of DSSCs based on hierarchically macroporous Zn2SnO4 increase from 3.92, 4.39, 4.76 to 5.01% with the corresponding PS size of 750, 600, 400 and 200 nm. Although the larger size of macropore has the higher light scattering ability, the smaller size Zn2SnO4 macropore provides better photovoltaic performance which can be mainly ascribed to a greater amount of dye loading, faster electron transport rate and slower electron recombination rate. Dye loading, IMPS, IMVS and EIS results reasonably elucidate the variations of the photovoltaic performance parameters (Jsc, Voc, FF and η) with the different sizes of macroporous Zn2SnO4. A double layered photoanode consisting of Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles (4.2 nm in particle size, 15 μm in film thickness) and macropores (180 nm in pore size, 4 μm in thickness) was designed for a DSSC in order to employ the bifunctional properties (more dye uptake and superior light scattering) showing an extremely high power conversion of 6.10%, which is the best value for ternary oxide photoelectrodes to date.
The hierarchically macroporous Zn2SnO4 materials are expected to further show excellent photovoltaic performances in viscous (ionic liquid, gel, or quasi state), solid state electrolyte based DSSC, or/and quantum dot sensitized solar cells because the larger voids facilitate the filling and transportation of such electrolytes; this is under investigation. Moreover, the optimization of the Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles, macropores or the thickness may further enhance the photovoltaic performance. The present hierarchical Zn2SnO4 macropore structures potentially provide promising performances in photocatalysis, Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors.
