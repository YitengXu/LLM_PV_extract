    , Accepted 1st December 2010First published on 24th December 2010AbstractIn solvent-free ionic liquid electrolytes for efficient dye-sensitized solar cells, iodide and non-iodide melts are ordinarily blended in order to attain a high dynamic fluidity and thereby meet a fast mass transport of electroactive species. This common tactic could bring forth a prominent impact of various anions on cell efficiency by altering photocurrent and/or photovoltage. Herein we report evident effects of the dicyanamideversustetracyanoborate anion on the energetics of titania conduction band edge and the kinetics of multi-channel charge-transfer reactions in cells employing a high absorption coefficient ruthenium sensitizer C106. A slightly shorter photoluminescence lifetime of C106 grafted on alumina is probed for the tetracyanoborate-based reference cell with respect to the dicyanamide counterpart. However, owing to a more favourable thermodynamic driving force of ∼90 meV, the tetracyanoborate anion prompts an almost 3-fold faster electron injection from the excited-state dye to titania than dicyanamide, leading to a higher charge separation yield, which is in good agreement with an almost indistinguishable ratio of external quantum efficiency enhancement in the whole spectral response region. Compared to tetracyanoborate, the presence of dicyanamide at the titania/electrolyte interface evokes a 27-fold smaller interfacial electron exchange rate (K) with triiodide, accounting for the open-circuit photovoltage variation observed in current–voltage measurements.
1. Introduction
Since the landmark breakthrough on dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) achieved by O'Regan and Grätzel,1 enormous academic and industrial research efforts have been devoted to this promising low-cost photovoltaic technology.2 Conversion of solar to electricity in DSCs is normally initiated vialight absorption by a photosensitizer grafted on a nanocrystalline titania film through the carboxylate–titanium assembly.3 A very fast electron injection occurs subsequently at the energy-offset titania/dye interface, followed by electron and hole transport oppositely to the current collectors through their respective conducting phases. The highest validated overall power conversion efficiency at the AM1.5G conditions has reached 11.2% with a DSC based upon a ruthenium photosensitizer.4 However, the use of a highly volatile organic solvent therein presents a momentous challenge in consideration of a robust electrolyte encapsulation for the future large-scale DSC application. In this regard, tremendous scientific endeavours have consecutively advanced the progress of solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells during the past years, focusing on the alternatives for volatile electrolytes, such as inorganic p-type semiconductors,5,6 organic hole-transporters7–10 and solid ionic conductors.11 On the other hand, the employment of solvent-free ionic liquids has emerged as another choice to address this pending issue,12,13 primarily in virtue of their negligible vapour pressures.
Actually, the use of ionic liquids as a conductive media in electrochemical cells can date back to the original work on alkylpyridinium chloroaluminate melts by Osteryoung et al.14 The seminal paper15 in 1992 by Wilkes and Zaworotko on air- and water-stable ionic liquids has revived this field as well as other applications.16–19 The first introduction of ionic liquids into DSCs has been accomplished by Grätzel et al. with 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide,20 however its extremely high viscosity (∼2200 cP) considerably limits the mass transport of redox species and thus the cell performance. Moreover, the low-fluidity of iodide ionic liquids cannot be very largely improved by altering organic cations, perhaps owing to the high polarizability of iodide.21,22 Thereby, melts based on less polarizable anions have been mixed with iodide-based salts to construct relatively high-fluidity ionic liquid electrolytes.23,24 In the past decade, enhancing the mass transport of ionic liquid electrolytes in DSCs has formed the research focus of this field.12,13,20–27 On the other side, our recent experiments28,29 have shown the anion-dependent performance of DSCs with ionic liquid electrolytes, likely caused by the different interactions of anions with titania nanocrystals. Herein, through a joint photophysical and electrical impedance study, we will take a close look at the origins of anion influences on the photocurrent action spectra and current–voltage (J–V) curves of dye-sensitized solar cells, by formulating two ionic liquid electrolytes characteristic of tetracyanoborate and dicyanamide anions, respectively.
2. Experiments
2.1 Materials

Acetonitrile, tert-butanol and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were distilled before use. Chenodeoxycholic acid (cheno), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) and iodine (I2) were purchased from Fluka and used as received. 1,3-Dimethylimidazolium iodide (DMII),301-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (EMII)30 and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide (EMIDCA)31 were prepared according to literature methods. 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetracyanoborate (EMITCB) and the WERO-4 scattering paste were received as gifts from Dyesol. The solvent-free ionic liquid electrolyte E1 is composed of DMII, EMII, EMITCB, I2 and TBP at a molar ratio of 12/12/16/1.67/3.33. A further replacement of EMITCB with EMIDCA forms the electrolyte E2. The detailed synthesis of the C106 dye has been described in our previous paper.32
2.2 
          Cell fabrication
We employed a double-layer titania film as the negative electrode of DSCs. On a precleaned fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass electrode (Nippon Sheet Glass, Solar, 4 mm thick), a 10 μm-thick transparent layer consisting of 23 nm-sized titania particles was first screen-printed and further coated by a 5 μm-thick second layer of scattering titania particles (WERO-4, Dyesol). The film thickness was monitored by a bench-top Ambios XP-1 stylus profilometer. The detailed preparation procedures of titania nanocrystals, paste for screen-printing and nanostructured titania film were reported in a previous paper.33 A titania electrode (∼0.28 cm2) was stained by immersing it into a solution containing 150 μM C106 dye and 2 mM cheno coadsorbent in a mixture of acetonitrile/tert-butanol/DMSO (9/9/2, volume ratio) for 16 h. After washing with acetonitrile and drying by air flow, the dye-coated titania electrode was assembled with a thermally platinized FTO positive electrode possessing an electrolyte-perfusion hole, which was beforehand produced with a sand-blasting drill. The two electrodes were separated by a 30 μm-thick Bynel (DuPont) hot-melt gasket and sealed up by heating. The internal space was perfused with an ionic liquid electrolyte with the aid of a vacuum back filling system. Ultimately, the hole on the positive electrode was closed hermetically with a Bynel sheet and a thin glass cover by heating.
2.3 
          Photocurrent action spectrum and current–voltage measurements
A Keithley 2400 source meter and a Zolix Omni-λ300 monochromator equipped with a 500 W xenon lamp were used for photocurrent action spectrum measurements. A Hamamatsu S1337-1010BQ silicon diode used for IPCE measurements was calibrated in National Institute of Metrology, China. During the photocurrent action spectrum measurements, a white light-emitting diode was used to bias a testing cell with ∼1.0 mA cm−2 background current. A model LS1000-4S-AM15G-1000W solar simulator (Solar Light Company, USA) in combination with a metal mesh was employed to give an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2. The light intensity was tested with a PMA2144 pyranometer and a calibrated PMA 2100 dose control system. J–V characteristics were obtained by applying a potential bias to a testing cell and measuring the current with a Keithley 2602 source meter under the full computer control. The measurements were fully automated using Labview 8.0. A metal mask with an aperture area of 0.167 cm2 was covered on a testing cell during measurements. An antireflection film (λ < 380 nm, ARKTOP, ASAHI Glass) was adhered to the DSC negative electrode during IPCE and J–V measurements. The short-circuit photocurrent densities measured under this solar simulator are well consistent with the integral of IPCEs over the AM1.5G spectrum (ASTM G173-03), within a 5% error.
2.4 Electronic absorption and emission measurements
Steady electronic absorption spectra were measured with a Perkin Elmer Lambda 900 spectrophotometer. Transient absorption measurements were performed with a LP920 laser flash spectrometer using a nanosecond tunable OPOLett-355II laser to supply a pump light. The sample was kept at a 45° angle with respect to the excitation beam. The probe light from a steady xenon arc lamp was passed through various optical elements, a testing sample and a monochromator before being detected by a fast photomultiplier tube and recorded with a TDS 3012C digital signal analyzer. Emission spectrum and time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) measurements were carried out with a LifeSpec-II spectrometer employing an EPL635 or EPL488 pulsed laser diode and a Hamamatsu H5773-04 photomultiplier. The instrument response function is ∼440 ps.
2.5 Electrical impedance measurements
Electrical impedance spectroscopies for a testing cell under various irradiations with a white light-emitting diode were recorded on an IM6ex electrochemical workstation, with a frequency range from 50 mHz to 100 kHz and a potential modulation of 20 mV. A voltage bias (V) was applied to equal the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of a testing cell at each irradiation intensity, fulfilling the criterion of an unmodulated current being zero. The obtained impedance data were fitted numerically with the Z-view software (v2.80, Scribner Associates Inc.) with a proper equivalent circuit adaptable to DSCs.34–36
2.6 Computational details
The ground-state geometries of tetracyanoborate and dicyanamide anions were fully optimized without symmetry constraints by the density functional theory (DFT)37 method, with hybrid Beck's three-parameter functional and Lee–Yang–Parr functional (B3LYP)38,39 and the standard 6-31G(d,p) basis set. All calculations reported here were performed with the Gaussian09 program package.40
3. Results and discussion
The multiplicative contributions from several pivotal optoelectronic processes to the photocurrent in DSCs, including light absorption of the dye-coated titania film, net charge separation at the titania/dye/electrolyte interface and carrier collection by the mesoporous titania electrode, can be preliminarily evaluated via measuring the incident photon-to-collected electron efficiency (IPCE) as a function of wavelength. As explicitly depicted in Fig. 1, a typical cell with ionic liquid electrolyte E1 exhibits higher IPCEs in the whole spectral response region with a maximum of ∼77%, compared to the E2 counterpart with a summit of ∼64%. It is valuable to notice that their normalized photocurrent action spectra (Fig. S1A, ESI†) match pretty well. Also, the electronic absorption (Fig. S1B, ESI†) of a C106 dye-coated titania film does not alter when the contacting electrolyte E1 is changed to E2. Thereby, it can be concluded that the relatively lower IPCE for the E2 cell cannot be attributed to a decreased charge collection efficiency. On the basis of this analysis, we can ascribe the IPCE height difference to dissimilar net charge separation yields in these two cells, which will be further elaborated by transient emission and absorption measurements. In essence, the net charge separation efficiency of a DSC is normally determined by two kinetic competition steps: one arises between the electron injection from excited dye molecules (D*) to titania and the deactivation of D* themselves; another is between dye regeneration with the iodide electron donor and charge recombination of dye cations with photoinjected electrons in titania.

An antireflection film was adhered to the testing cell during measurement. The cell was tested with a metal shadow mask having an aperture area of 0.167 cm2. The solid lines are guides to eye. 
We first resorted to the time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) technique to determine the electron injection efficiency at the titania/dye/electrolyte interface.41,42 In order to intimately imitate the practical cell conditions, we tested the emission of a dye-coated nanoporous alumina or titania film permeated with ionic liquid electrolyte E1 or E2. Note that the absorption and emission spectra of C106 do not significantly depend on either the mesoporous oxide film or the electrolyte system (Fig. S2, ESI†). As presented in Fig. 2, the time-correlated emission decay traces are well fitted with a stretch exponential function of (1)where I0 is the initial emission amplitude on alumina, α is the stretch parameter and τ denotes the lifetime. The photoluminescence average lifetimes () of the C106 dye molecules anchored on alumina in contact with E1 and E2 were calculated with  = (τ/α)Γ(1/α) where Γ(x) is a gamma function, being 26.5 and 30.5 ns, respectively. Moreover, the emission average lifetimes on titania film are notably reduced to 2.2 and 5.2 ns for the corresponding E1 and E2 electrolytes. Hereby, we can derive the electron injection rate constant to be 4.2 × 108 and 1.6 × 108 s–1 for cells with E1 and E2, respectively. Furthermore, we can calculate the respective electron injection efficiency (ηinj) to be 92% and 83% for cells made from electrolytes E1 and E2 in terms of the following equation (2)where titania and alumina represent the photoluminescence average lifetimes on titania and alumina films, respectively. Obviously, the tetracyanoborate-based electrolyte evoked an almost 3-fold faster electron injection relative to the dicyanamide counterpart, leading to a higher charge separation yield, despite that its presence induced a shorter photoluminescence average lifetime of the C106 dye molecules grafted on alumina.
 Fig. 2  Time-correlated emission decay trace of a C106-grafted mesoporous alumina (red dots) or titania (blue dots) film immersed in electrolyte E1 or E2. Excitation wavelength: 639 nm. Detection wavelength at the maximum emission intensity: 745 nm. The emission intensity (I) was corrected in terms of the film absorbance at 639 nm. The black lines are fittings with eqn (1). 
To figure out the energetics lying behind the electrolyte-dependent electron injection kinetics, we first employed the square-wave voltammetric method to measure the ground-state redox potential of the C106 dye anchored on a titania film immersed in pure EMITCB or EMIDCA, being −5.444 V versus vacuum for both cases. We also recorded the absorption and emission spectra of cells with E1 and E2 (Fig. S2, ESI†) and obtained the zero–zero transition energy E0–0 of 1.870 eV, regardless of the anion selection. Thus we can estimate the excited-state redox potential of the C106 dye in cells with E1 and E2 to be −3.574 V versus vacuum. Obviously, we can rule out the thermodynamic influence stemming from the dye side on electron injection.
We further resorted to the electrical impedance technique34–36 to determine the titania conduction band edge (Ec), which is another factor influencing the interfacial energy offset. Ec can be derived from the electron transport resistance (Rt) of the mesoporous titania film43 using the following formula (3)where R0 denotes the electron transport resistance in the conduction band and is taken as an invariant for a given cell geometry. kB and T are the Boltzmann constant and the absolute temperature, and e is the elementary charge. The potential bias V = (EF,n − EF,redox)/e, where EF,n and EF,redox represent the Fermi levels of titania and electrolyte, respectively. Note that here we introduce β as an empirical factor to account for the possible non-ideal thermodynamic behaviour of free electrons in the conduction band.44
As Fig. 3 shows, the dependence of Rt on V can be well fitted in terms of eqn (3), giving the (Ec − EF,redox) of cells with E1 and E2 to be 1.013 and 1.101 eV. The plot of Rtversus V is not intended to compare the electron transport resistance at a given potential bias. An excellent modelling of experimental data can afford a correct estimate of the titania conduction band edge shifts. Moreover, quantum calculations show that the nitrogen atoms of dicyanamide possess a larger negative charge density than those of tetracyanoborate as illustrated in Fig. 4. A higher negative charge density could cause a strong coordination of nitrogen with the unsaturated titanium species on the mesoporous titania film, uplifting the conduction band edge as TBP does.45,46 Thereby, we can conclude that compared to dicyanamide, the presence of tetracyanoborate evokes a more favourable driving force at the dye/titania interface for a faster electron injection. A comprehensive experimental analysis to draw an explicit microscopic picture of the interaction between anions and titania could be addressed by using some modern interfacial physical measurement techniques.

We are also curious to know if anions in ionic liquid electrolytes impact the kinetics of both dye cation interception by iodide (dye regeneration) and dye cation recombination with photoinjected electrons. The kinetic competition of these two charge-transfer pathways may also affect the IPCE maximum.42,47,48 We carried out laser-induced transient absorption measurements at a monochromatic probe light of 782 nm, to scrutinize the dual-channel charge-transfer kinetics of the C106 dye cations. The excitation fluence was carefully controlled in our kinetic measurements to ensure that ∼2.4 × 1014photons cm–2 (∼1.7 photons per nanoparticle) were absorbed by the dye-coated titania film during every laser pulse. The absorption traces (Fig. 5) were well fitted by a stretched exponential function (mΔOD ∝ exp[−(t/τ)α]), affording a half-reaction time t1/2.

(a) EMITCB/TBP (40/3.33, molar ratio); (b) DMII/EMII/EMITCB/I2/TBP (12/12/16/1.67/3.33, molar ratio); (c) EMIDCA/TBP (40/3.33, molar ratio); (d) DMII/EMII/EMIDCA/I2/TBP (12/12/16/1.67/3.33, molar ratio). Excitation wavelength: 615 nm. Pulse fluence: 81.8 μJ cm–2. Smooth black lines are stretched exponential fittings to experimental data obtained by averaging over 1500 laser shots. 
In the absence of electroactive iodide ions, the t1/2 of 5240 μs for the control cell with EMITCB is relatively shorter than that of 6360 μs with EMIDCA. The slow kinetics can be mainly ascribed to charge recombination reaction of dye cations with photo-injected electrons in titania. Upon employment of electrolytes E1 and E2, both absorption decays are notably accelerated (b and d) owing to the occurrence of dye regeneration, producing t1/2 of 5.0 and 8.8 μs. The kinetic branch ratios of dye regeneration and charge recombination are over 720 for both anions, indicating that almost 100% of the dye cations can be intercepted by the iodide anions in electrolytes E1 and E2. Thereby, we can conclude that the negligible difference in the aforementioned kinetic competition could not account for the observed IPCE summit variation.
We further evaluated the photovoltaic performance of cells based on ionic liquid electrolytes E1 and E2 by measuring the J–V characteristics under an irradiation of 100 mW cm–2 simulated sunlight, as visualized in Fig. 6, the E1 cell exhibits an open-circuit photovoltage Voc of 713 mV, notably lower than that of 793 mV for the E2 cell. Moreover, in good agreement with the preceding IPCE measurements, the tetracyanoborate-based electrolyte confers a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 14.34 mA cm–2, generating to an overall power conversion efficiency (η) of 7.54%. In contrast, a noticeably lower Jsc of 11.70 mA cm–2 is obtained upon the utilization of the dicyanamide electrolyte, leading to a relatively depressed η of 7.32%. Note that cells fabricated in our lab always display an excellent reproducibility with an efficiency error range of ±0.05%.

Apparently, the selection of anions in ionic liquid electrolytes can have a significant influence on the cell photovoltage. To understand the Voc variation between TCB and DCA, we first consider a continuity equation depicting the current pathways in DSCs under the open-circuit condition, where the current generation rate (Ig) is compensated by Un, the rate of interfacial charge recombination with triiodide, (4)where d is the film thickness, and Un49 can be expressed with (5)where k0 is the apparent reaction rate constant, nc is the electron density in the conduction band. γ is the reaction order and n0 is the equilibrium electron density, which can be given by n0 = Nc exp[(EF,redox − Ec)/kBT], where Nc refers to the density of states in the conduction band. Combining eqn (4) and (5), the dependence of Voc on the current generation and charge recombination kinetics appears as (6)Note that K is defined with K = k0nγ0, which virtually represents the interfacial electron exchange rate under the dark condition. Eqn (6) displays the Voc correlation with the competition between current generation (Jsc) and current loss through charge recombination with triiodide (γ and K). As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the Jsc increase of cell with E1 relative to the E2 counterpart tends to introduce a Voc enhancement of only 5 mV, indicating that the remarkable Voc variation can be essentially ascribed to the dissimilarity in the interfacial charge recombination kinetics. In addition, the K and γ can be obtained by fitting potential bias-related recombination resistance (Rct), which can also be obtained by modelling the impedance spectroscopies. Under the open-circuit condition, Jsc equals the recombination reaction current density Jrec. In further combination with eqn (6), Rct can be derived as (7)where A is the cell area. Fittings on the interfacial charge-transfer resistance Rct (Fig. 7A) with eqn (7) afford γ and K, as listed in Table S1 (ESI†). Despite that the E2 cell exhibits a relatively larger recombination reaction order (E1: 0.80, E2: 0.84), it features a K value of 2.54 × 108 cm–3 s–1, which is over one order of magnitude smaller than that of 6.94 × 109 cm–3 s–1 for the cell with electrolyte E1, leading to a relatively suppressed interfacial charge-transfer behaviour at a given electron Fermi level (eqn (5)) and echoing the higher open-circuit photovoltage according to eqn (6). Additionally, by inserting K = k0nγ0 into eqn (7), the apparent reaction rate constant k0 can also be fitted from the Rct dependence on V (Table S1, ESI†). As elucidated by Fig. 7B, the E2 cell shows a relatively faster interfacial charge recombination rate (Un) at a given free electron density. We note that the charge recombination rate comparisons at a given Fermi-level or electron density afford a dissimilar conclusion, because in these two cases the contribution of either carrier density or the thermodynamic driving force is not fully included.

4. Conclusions
To summarize, we have analyzed the intrinsic origins of the electrolyte anion influences on photovoltaic parameters of dye-sensitized solar cells made from two solvent-free ionic liquid electrolytes based on tetracyanoborate and dicyanamide, respectively, in conjunction with the high absorptivity ruthenium dye C106. With respect to the dicyanamide counterpart, the tetracyanoborate electrolyte confers a relatively shorter photoluminescence lifetime on the dye C106 anchored on titania nanocrystals. However, a higher charge separation yield at the titania/dye/electrolyte interface is counterintuitively determined for the tetracyanoborate case, mainly benefited from an almost 3-fold faster electron injection as revealed by transient emission measurements. The energetics behind the injection difference are further elaborated via measuring electrical impedance spectroscopies. Analysis of transport resistances of the mesoporous titania film at different electron-filling levels has revealed a notably lower titania conduction band edge for a cell containing tetracyanoborate relative to dicyanamide. This is further rationalized through DFT calculations, disclosing a higher negative charge density of the expected electron-donating sites on dicyanamide. We have introduced an equilibrium recombination rate K to evaluate the interfacial charge transfer kinetics of the recombination reaction with triiodide. A 27-fold K decrease for the dicyanamide cell plays a decisive role on the observed higher open-circuit photovoltage, with respect to tetracyanoborate.
