    , Accepted 13th May 2022First published on 14th May 2022AbstractDespite the remarkable progress in perovskite optoelectronic devices, the realization of high-performance and stable devices based on low-bandgap mixed lead (Pb)–tin (Sn) halide remains highly challenging. Here we present a promising strategy to improve the performance and stability of mixed lead–tin halide perovskite photovoltaics by using metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as additives, including UiO-66 and UiO-66-NH2. Compared with UiO-66, the electron-donating amine group of UiO-66-NH2 can interact with under-coordinated metal cations in the perovskite crystals (i.e., Pb2+ or Sn2+), leading to efficient trap-state passivation and thus superior device performance. With interfacial engineering via molecular doping, the resultant devices exhibit a high-power conversion efficiency of 13.93% and substantially improved ambient stability. To the best of our knowledge, the device performance demonstrated herein represents the highest value ever reported for CH3NH3SnxPb1−xI3-based perovskite solar cells with an active area larger than 0.1 cm2. Importantly, this strategy is also applicable to perovskite photodetectors (PDs), delivering record-high performance for low-bandgap (≤1.3 eV) perovskite PDs. This work provides a new route to simultaneously improve the performance and stability of mixed Pb–Sn perovskite photovoltaics based on a facile strategy, which can accelerate perovskite-based optoelectronics toward future commercialization.

Design, System, Application
The defect density in organometallic halide perovskites plays an important role in determining the overall photovoltaic performance. In this study, functional additives are incorporated into mixed lead–tin halide low-bandgap perovskites to improve their optoelectronic properties and stability. For a molecular design optimization strategy, MOFs are introduced to confine CH3NH3SnxPb1−xI3-based perovskite for better approximation between the perovskite and amino functionality, which is found to interact with uncoordinated Pb2+ or Sn2+ defects, leading to efficient trap-state passivation. In addition, MOF confinement can retard the permeation of moisture and oxygen into the perovskite films and thus alleviate the degradation. On the other hand, CTAB incorporation to ITIC shows an efficient anion-induced electron transfer, leading to a drastic enhancement in conductivity. We believe that the ideas demonstrated herein, including the incorporation of MOFs for defect passivation of lead–tin halide low-bandgap perovskites, as well as the addition of CTAB as the dopant for improving the electron extraction of the devices, have great future potential in low-bandgap perovskite photovoltaic applications.

Introduction
The application of organometallic halide perovskites for light-harvesting applications, such as solar cells and photodetectors (PDs), has stimulated a myriad of scientific and industrial efforts due to their potentially cost-effective manufacturing and exceptional optoelectronic properties. Although solar cells and PDs have similar device structures and working principles, their application purposes are different. Solar cells are designed to provide power to external loads. In contrast, PDs are used to convert the optical signals into electrical signals, and they do not require delivering any photovoltages as solar cells to obtain optimal light detection performance.1–3 Despite recent advances, the commercialization of perovskite-based solar cells and PDs remains a hurdle, and one key challenge lies in the insufficient device stability owing to the fact that hybrid perovskite materials are highly vulnerable to moisture.4 To address this issue, apart from the recent developments of a reliable encapsulation layer to prevent the ingress of ambient moisture,5,6 much research effort has been focused on improving the intrinsic stability of perovskite materials, with particular emphasis on the manipulation of perovskite composition and incorporation of functional additives.7–9 It is generally accepted that weak interactions between the metal cations and halide anions can easily generate ionic defects in perovskites, which accelerate the structural decomposition of perovskites in the presence of sunlight and moisture. To circumvent this problem, a promising strategy is to incorporate Lewis base molecules as additives that can passivate the defect sites of the perovskite layer through the coordination-type bonding between the electron-donating groups and under-coordinated metal cations.10,11 Despite considerable efforts, however, this strategy still has tremendous room for improvement. For example, low-bandgap (≤1.3 eV) perovskites that can extend the photon harvesting range to the near-infrared region are advantageous for a wide range of applications (e.g., biomedical sensors, bioimaging).12,13 Nonetheless, the adoption of additive engineering for low-bandgap perovskite systems is rarely reported. This issue becomes particularly challenging for Sn-substituted low-bandgap perovskites (e.g., mixed Pb–Sn halide perovskites) due to the unfavorable oxidation reaction of tin (from Sn2+ to Sn4+) together with fast and uncontrollable perovskite crystal growth.14,15 Apart from the stability improvement, several studies have also elucidated that the additive-induced defect passivation can also benefit the overall device performance.14,15
For incorporating Lewis base molecules with perovskite, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) serve as a good candidate because of their tunable functionality.16,17 MOFs are one kind of three-dimensional porous crystalline material comprised of metal nodes and organic ligands. Their high specific surface area (SSA), crystallinity, and catalytic activity, stable structure, and tunable porosity, pore size, and functionality make them commonly applied in catalysts, gas storage, electrochromic thin films, or other chemical applications.18,19 Besides, some Zr-based MOFs such as UiO-66-NH2 have alkaline functional groups and can be well dispersed in the same solution with perovskite. This makes incorporating MOFs as Lewis base molecules with perovskite become possible. Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of using MOFs as either additives or interfacial layers in realizing efficient and stable perovskite solar cells.20–22 It has been reported that MOFs as additives improve the perovskite crystallinity, moisture resistance, thermal/chemical stability, light absorption, and charge transfer.16,23–26 For example, the incorporation of the UiO-66 MOF as an interfacial modifier and additive can effectively improve the stability and performance of perovskite solar cells, as shown in ESI† Table S1. Nevertheless, this strategy has never been examined in low-bandgap mixed lead–tin halide perovskite systems,17,20,27 and its applicability to PDs remains unclear at this stage.
Engineering and optimization of the interfaces between the perovskite active layer and electrodes have proven to be a promising approach toward enhancing the performance and stability of perovskite-based solar cells and PDs.28–31 An ideal interfacial layer should meet several requirements, including an appropriate energy level for efficient charge carrier extraction, good charge selectivity to reduce charge recombination, good film-forming properties to avoid surface defect formation, sufficient stability to prevent undesirable reactions at the active layer/electrode interface, and reasonable electrical conductivity to lower the series resistance.31,32 The insensitivity of the interfacial layer thickness to the photovoltaic performance is particularly important for large-area perovskite-based optoelectronic device applications, which can broaden the processing window without significantly affecting the device performance. To this end, recent efforts have been devoted to developing chemically doped interfacial layers.33–35 However, these interfacial layers, especially for n-doped materials, still present some inadequacies, including complex synthesis procedures,36,37 poor stability,38,39 and insufficient electrical conductivity.40 Additionally, the applications of these interfacial layers in large-area devices (active area > 1 cm2) remain highly challenging. The minuscule options of appropriate interfacial layers available to efficient and stable large-area devices have become a bottleneck that hinders the further development of perovskite photovoltaic technology.
In the present report, we focus our efforts on achieving efficient and stable mixed lead–tin halide perovskite CH3NH3Sn0.25Pb0.75I3 solar cells and PDs through the incorporation of MOFs as additives. Two MOFs, UiO-66 and UiO-66-NH2, were examined herein (see ESI† Fig. S1 for the chemical structures). Compared with UiO-66, the electron-donating amine group of UiO-66-NH2 can interact with under-coordinated metal cations in the perovskite crystals (i.e., Pb2+ or Sn2+), leading to efficient trap-state passivation and thus superior device performance. On the other hand, the incorporation of strongly electron-donating cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, see Fig. 1a for its chemical structure) is able to undergo n-doping 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC, see Fig. 1a for its chemical structure) via efficient anion-induced electron transfer (as shown in Fig. 1a), leading to a drastic enhancement in conductivity by 4 orders of magnitude. Combining the UiO-66-NH2 additive with the n-doped ITIC electron transport layer (ETL), the resulting solar cells deliver power conversion efficiency (PCE) that can reach up to 13.93%, which is ≈1.4-fold enhancement compared with that of the control device (i.e., without a MOF and CTAB dopant). In particular, benefitting from the high conductivity of the n-doped ETL, a prominent PCE as high as 12.89% can be realized even when the active area is increased to 1.2 cm2, which represents the record-high performance for CH3NH3SnxPb1−xI3-based perovskite solar cells with an active area larger than 0.1 cm2. More encouragingly, in contrast to the rapid deterioration of the control device, the device with UiO-66-NH2 can withstand prolonged air exposure, maintaining ≈60% of its initial efficiency after 550 hours of storage in an ambient atmosphere. Importantly, this strategy also works well for perovskite PD application, delivering record-high performance for low-bandgap (≤1.3 eV) perovskite PDs. The present findings offer facile and promising strategies for realizing efficient and stable low-bandgap perovskite optoelectronic devices.

Results and discussion

Fig. 1b presents the X-ray diffraction patterns of UiO-66 and UiO-66-NH2. The strong peaks at 2θ = 7.5°, 8.5°, and 26° corresponding to the (111), (200), and (006) planes indicate the excellent crystalline structures of UiO-66 and UiO-66-NH2 in our work. On the other hand, the crystallite sizes of UiO-66 and UiO-66-NH2 by the Scherrer equation are 332 Å and 347 Å, respectively. The X-ray diffraction patterns of composites UiO-66/perovskite and UiO-66-NH2/perovskite are shown in Fig. 1c. Note that the preparation and characterization of CH3NH3Sn0.25Pb0.75I3 films can be found in our previous study.41 The obvious peaks at 2θ = 14.8° and 29.0° correspond to the (110) and (220) planes of the perovskite, with no apparent peaks of the MOFs. This could be due to the low concentration of MOFs (20 mg mL−1) in the perovskite precursor solution. Besides, the crystallite sizes of UiO-66/perovskite and UiO-66-NH2/perovskite are 554 Å (2θ = 2 14.8°) and 562 Å (2θ = 14.8°), respectively. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption curves of UiO-66 and UiO-66-NH2 are shown in Fig. 1d. UiO-66 and UiO-66-NH2 show type I isotherms, indicating their microporous structure. Besides, the BET specific surface areas of UiO-66 and UiO-66-NH2 are 981 m2 g−1 and 905 m2 g−1, respectively, agreeing with the literature data.42 The reduction in the UiO-66-NH2 BET SSA is because the amino group occupies the MOF pores. The pore size distributions of UiO-66 and UiO-66-NH2 are shown in Fig. 1e. The main peaks in the pore size distribution (PSD) of UiO-66 and UiO-66-NH2 are 12 Å and 15 Å, and 11 Å and 13 Å, respectively. This result is in line with the theoretical values and meets our expectations.43 After incorporating the MOFs into the perovskite, the BET specific surface areas of the UiO-66/perovskite and UiO-66-NH2/perovskite composites are significantly reduced, lower than 15 m2 g−1, which approaches that of the perovskite. This implies that the perovskite is confined in the MOFs' micropores or that the MOF concentration is low, thus reducing the SSA.
The surface morphology of the perovskite film with and without a MOF was then investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 2 and 3, the perovskite films with and without MOFs exhibited nearly comparable grain size (≈400 nm) and surface roughness (≈30 nm), implying that the incorporation of MOFs may not cause adverse effects on the deposited perovskite film. To clarify the interaction of the perovskite with UiO-66-NH2, we examined the chemical states of as-synthesized UiO-66-NH2, pristine perovskite, and UiO-66-NH2/perovskite composite films by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The FTIR spectra of the perovskite exhibit the N–H stretching, C–H stretching, N–H bending, C–H bending, C–N stretching, and N–H wagging at around 3457 cm−1, 3115 cm−1, 1589 cm−1, 1459 cm−1, and 910 cm−1.44,45 The characteristic peaks of the pristine UiO-66-NH2 correspond well to the UiO-66 series in the literature.46–49 By contrast, the C–N band and N–H band of the UiO-66-NH2/perovskite composite absorption bands are shifted. The N–H bending of UiO-66-NH2 in the perovskite film was moved to 1596 cm−1 from 1589 cm−1, and the N–H band shifted to 920 from 898 cm−1, which are attributed to the coordinate effects between the nitrogen lone pairs of the –NH2 group and Pb ions of the perovskite, supporting the existence of chemical interaction between NH2 and Pb.50,51 The composite also shows 769 cm−1 and 667 cm−1 peaks, which come from the Zr–O of UiO-66-NH2.49,52 A figure and table showing the list of FTIR band assignment are included in ESI† Fig. S2 and Table S2. This result could be attributed to the fact that the lone pair electrons on the amine group of the UiO-66-NH2 MOF can delocalize into the empty orbital of under-coordinated metal cations in the perovskite crystals (i.e., Pb2+ or Sn2+), thereby passivating the defect sites and removing the trap states within the perovskite layer,53,54 as shown in Fig. 4c.

The device structure investigated herein is indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrate/TiOx/ITIC/CH3NH3Sn0.25Pb0.75I3/p-doped cross-linked poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethyl-phenyl)amine] (PTAA)/Ag, as shown in Fig. 1a. As has been demonstrated in our previous report,41 p-doped cross-linked PTAA consists of a molybdenum tris-[1-(trifluoroethanoyl)-2-(trifluoro-methyl)ethane-1,2-dithiolene] (Mo(tfd-COCF3)3) dopant and a 1,2-bis[4-(azidomethyl)phenyl]-1,2-diphenylethene (TPE-MN3) cross-linker is selected as a hole transport layer (HTL) because it has several advantages such as an appropriate energy level, reasonable film conductivity, fine work-function tunability for electrodes, and good solvent resistance. The chemical structures of these molecules are shown in ESI† Fig. S3. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices measured under AM 1.5G irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 5a, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters of these devices are summarized in Table 1. For the control device without a MOF (device A), it exhibits a moderate PCE of 9.94%, with a Jsc of 22.64 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.73 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 60.17% (Table 1 and Fig. 5a). It should be noted that the efficiency of the control device is comparable to the reported values for the CH3NH3Sn0.25Pb0.75I3 system.41 Importantly, we found that MOF incorporation could increase the device efficiency, especially in the case of UiO-66-NH2. The device with UiO-66 (device B) exhibits a PCE of 10.17%, while a superior PCE of 13.93% is observed in the case of UiO-66-NH2 as an additive (device C), with a higher Voc of 0.75 V (Table 1 and Fig. 5a). Considering that the Voc value is highly associated with the trap density of the perovskite layer,55,56 we suggest that UiO-66-NH2 is able to passivate the defects within the perovskite layer through the coordination-type bonding between the amine groups and under-coordinated lead ions, similar to earlier reports.57 To determine the extent of defect-caused charge carrier traps within the devices, the light intensity dependence of Voc of the devices is investigated. Previous studies have reported that the extent of the trap-assisted recombination increases with the slope of Vocversus the natural logarithm of the light intensity.58,59 The slopes of 1.68 kBT/q and 1.09 kBT/q are observed for the devices without and with the UiO-66-NH2 MOF, respectively. Compared with the control device (device A), the less dependence of Voc on the light intensity of device C (see Fig. 5b) implies that the incorporation of the UiO-66-NH2 MOF into the perovskite layer may reduce the trap densities within the perovskite layer and suppress the trap-related charge recombination.60,61

More encouragingly, the device efficiency can be further improved by incorporating CTAB as the dopant into the ITIC ETL.33,62 As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 5a, the device with this doped ETL (device D) affords a PCE of up to 13.93%. The device with the doped ETL (device D) also exhibits a maximum incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of 76% at 670 nm, which surpasses that of the device without a MOF (device A) with a maximum IPCE of 64% at 630 nm, as shown in Fig. 6a. The absorption spectrum of the as-fabricated device (device D) is shown in ESI† Fig. S4. It should be noted that the reported Jsc value (25.73 mA cm−2; see Table 1) agrees well with the value integrated from the IPCE spectrum (23.72 mA cm−2; see Fig. 6a), confirming the accuracy of the reported PCE. The observed performance improvement can be rationalized by the reduced series resistance (defined as the inverse slope of the dark J–V curve at 1 V). As shown in Fig. 5c, the incorporation of MOF UiO-66-NH2 decreases the series resistance from 139.8 Ω cm2 to 16.5 Ω cm2, while the shunt resistance (defined as the inverse slope of the dark J–V curve at 0 V) remains virtually unchanged (≈2 MΩ cm2). We suggest that electron transfer between the anions of the CTAB dopant and ITIC may occur, leading to n-type doping. To confirm this, the electrical conductivity of CTAB as a function of doping concentration is then studied. The conductivity of the ITIC film dramatically increases at low doping concentration (<5 mol%) and gives the highest conductivity of 1.2 × 10−4 S cm−1 at the doping concentration of 10 mol%, which is about 4 orders of magnitude higher than that of the pristine undoped ITIC film (Fig. 5d). Beyond this doping concentration, however, the film conductivity begins to decrease, which can be attributed to the presence of undesired disconnected islands,33 as evidenced by the aggregated film morphology (ESI† Fig. S5). It should be noted that the device with the doped ETL (device D) also reveals hysteresis-free photocurrent behavior (Fig. 5e) and a stabilized PCE of 13.8% at the maximum power point (Fig. 5f). Considering that the CTAB-doped ITIC ETL possesses high electrical conductivity, the efficiency of the device with a larger active area of 1.2 cm2 is also examined (device E). Encouragingly, the resulting device exhibits a reasonable PCE of 12.89% (Table 1 and Fig. 5a). The device performance of the state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells based on the CH3NH3SnxPb1−xI3 system is also listed for comparison purposes. Very encouragingly, the PCE obtained in this study represents the highest value reported to date for CH3NH3SnxPb1−xI3-based solar cells with an active area larger than 0.1 cm2, as shown in Table 2. These results clearly validate the effectiveness of the CTAB-doped ITIC ETL for perovskite solar cells.

Given that the UiO-66-NH2 MOF is capable of passivating defects within perovskites, the air-stability of the devices is also examined. The evolution of degradation profiles of the devices (device D) without encapsulation as a function of storage time in ambient air (25 °C and 70% relative humidity) is shown in Fig. 6b. In contrast to the significant degradation observed in the control device (device A), the device with the UiO-66-NH2 MOF (device D) exhibits superior stability, maintaining ≈60% of its initial efficiency after 550 hours of air exposure (Fig. 6b). Such stability improvement could be ascribed to the defect passivation of the CH3NH3Sn0.25Pb0.75I3 perovskite layer via the UiO-66-NH2 MOF, which can retard the permeation of moisture and/or oxygen into the perovskite films and thus alleviate the degradation.20,63,64 These results emphasize the importance of MOF UiO-66-NH2 incorporation to passivate the defects in the perovskite layer.
In addition to solar cell applications, we also examine the characteristics of CH3NH3Sn0.25Pb0.75I3-based PDs using the UiO-66-NH2 MOF as the additive. The device structure investigated herein is identical to the solar cells except for their operation mode. Various critical parameters of PDs, including the responsivity (R), specific detectivity (D*), and linear dynamic range (LDR), are then investigated. The responsivity and detectivity represent the key merits for PDs, which can be estimated according to the following equation:3,65,66 (1) (2)where IPCE is the incident photon-to-current efficiency, e is the elementary charge, λ is the excitation wavelength, h is the Planck constant, c is the light speed in vacuum, R is the responsivity, A is the active area of the device, ID is the dark current, and JD is the dark current density. The PDs without the UiO-66-NH2 MOF only exhibit moderate device performance, with a responsivity of 0.43 A W−1 and a specific detectivity of 8.1 × 1011 Jones at a wavelength of 830 nm under zero bias conditions, as shown in Fig. 6c and d. Very encouragingly, the incorporation of the UiO-66-NH2 MOF significantly improves the device performance, delivering a responsivity of 0.51 A W−1 and a specific detectivity of 1.1 × 1013 Jones at a wavelength of 870 nm under zero bias conditions (Table 3, Fig. 6c and d). Additionally, the linear dynamic ranges (LDRs) of the devices are also investigated, which can be expressed as follows:3,65,66 (3)where Llinear(max) and Llinear(min) represent the maximum and minimum incident light intensity at which the photocurrent begins to deviate from linearity, respectively. Similarly, under zero bias conditions, the incorporation of the UiO-66-NH2 MOF delivers a remarkably high LDR of 192.6 dB at a wavelength of 870 nm (Table 3 and Fig. 6f), which outperforms that of the device without a MOF (LDR = 120.4 dB at a wavelength of 830 nm, see Table 3 and Fig. 6e). We also compare these characteristics with the values reported in the literature for low-bandgap (≤1.3 eV) perovskite PDs (Table 3). Notably, our PDs greatly suppress the reported values (see Table 3), confirming the effectiveness of the UiO-66-NH2 MOF for improving the device performance via defect passivation. These results also validate that incorporating the UiO-66-NH2 MOF as an additive can be a universal strategy for developing high-performance perovskite optoelectronic devices.

In conclusion, efficient and stable PePVs are demonstrated by incorporating the UiO-66-NH2 MOF as an additive. Our results indicate that the electron-donating amine group of UiO-66-NH2 can interact with under-coordinated metal cations in the perovskite crystals, leading to efficient trap-state passivation and thus superior device performance. Combining the UiO-66-NH2 additive with the CTAB-doped ITIC ETL, a PCE of up to 13.93% is attained, which is much superior to that of the control device. In particular, owing to the high conductivity of the ITIC ETL, a PCE as high as 12.89% is demonstrated even when the active area is increased to 1.2 cm2. To the best of our knowledge, the device performance achieved herein represents the record-high value for perovskite solar cells with an active area larger than 0.1 cm2. More encouragingly, the device exhibits good stability without any encapsulation, retaining ≈60% of its initial efficiency after 550 hours of air exposure(Fig. 6d and ESI† Table S3). We also demonstrate that UiO-66-NH2 MOF passivation can be used for perovskite PD applications, which showcases the versatility of the proposed strategy. This work provides a promising strategy for simultaneously achieving efficient and stable low-bandgap PePVs, paving the way for improving the commercial viability of this technology. Our findings can also open a new avenue for diverse applications such as bio-sensing devices and thermoelectric generators.
Experimental
Materials
Patterned ITO-coated glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 15 ohm sq−1 were purchased from Ruilong Tech. Methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I, >99.5%) was purchased from Lumtec. PTAA (Mw = 17500gmol−1) was purchased from Lumtec. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received unless otherwise stated.
Synthesis of UiO-66 and UiO-66-NH2
UiO-66 was synthesized by a solvothermal process modified from our report.43 Briefly, zirconium tetrachloride (0.240 g) and terephthalic acid (0.171 g) were dissolved in 60 mL N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) at room temperature. MOF precipitation can be seen after being heated at 120 °C for 24 hours. Afterward, we removed possible coordinated DMF molecules by solvent exchange with ethanol (20 mL) twice for 6 to 12 hours. As-received UiO-66 was obtained after suction filtration for 15 to 30 minutes. On the other hand, terephthalic acid was replaced with 2-aminoterephthalic acid to obtain UiO-66-NH2, followed by the same process as UiO-66 synthesis.
Synthesis of TiOx precursor solution
The synthesis procedure was according to the literature with slight modification.67 Briefly, titanium(IV) isopropoxide (1.8 mL) was mixed with 2-methoxylethanol (10 mL) and ethanolamine (0.9 mL) at room temperature for 1.5 hours, and then stirred at 120 °C for 1.5 hours. The cooled-down solution was then diluted in anhydrous 2-propanol (1:40 v/v).
Synthesis of CH3NH3Sn0.25Pb0.75I3 precursor solution
The preparation of CH3NH3Sn0.25Pb0.75I3 precursor solution follows our previous study.41 Briefly, 345.7 mg PbI2 and 159 mg methylammonium iodide (MAI) were first dissolved in 1 mL DMF/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent (1:1 v/v) and stirred at room temperature for 60 minutes. The solution was added to a vial with 93.1 mg SnI2 and stirred at 70 °C for 12 hours before use.
Device fabrication
The device structure investigated in this study is shown in Fig. 1a. ITO-coated glass substrates were first ultrasonicated in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and 2-propanol, followed by UV-ozone treatment for 60 minutes. The TiOx precursor solution was filtered with a 0.45 μm nylon filter and spin-coated onto the substrate (3000 rpm for 60 s), followed by thermal annealing at 200 °C for 60 min (thickness = 20 nm). The ITIC solution (20 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) was filtered with a 0.45 μm polytetrafluoroethylene filter and then spin-coated (2000 rpm for 60 s) on top of the TiOx layer, followed by annealing at 80 °C for 10 min (thickness = 40 nm). The CH3NH3Sn0.25Pb0.75I3 precursor solution with and without adding MOFs (UiO-66 or UiO-66-NH2; 20 mg mL−1 in precursor solution) was filtered with a 0.45 μm polytetrafluoroethylene filter and sequentially spin-coated onto the substrate (1000 rpm for 10 s and 5000 rpm for 40 s) in a glove box. Note that 400 μL ortho-xylene was slowly dripped on the substrates in the first 20 seconds of the second stage. The samples were then annealed at 100 °C for 10 minutes, and the layer thickness was 350 nm. After the deposition of the perovskite layer, the PTAA solution (10 mg mL−1 in chloroform) containing 1 wt% Mo(tfd-COCF3)3 dopant and 5 wt% TPE-MN3 cross-linker was then spin-coated on top of the formed perovskite layer (thickness = 60 nm). The cross-linking reaction was performed under UV light illumination (wavelength = 254 nm; intensity = 5 mW cm−2) for 4 min in an inert atmosphere. Afterward, the Ag electrode (thickness = 150 nm) was then deposited from a thermal evaporator under high vacuum (<10−6 torr). To eliminate the Jsc from regions outside the active area, an illumination mask with an aperture size of 0.12 or 1.2 cm2 was used.
Characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured using a Bruker D8 multipurpose X-ray diffractometer with 2θ from 5° to 70°, a scan speed of 0.1233 s−1, and a Cu Kα (λ = 1.543 Å) X-ray source. The full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peaks was applied for the Scherrer equation to estimate the crystallite size of the MOFs. The textural properties like the specific surface area (SSA) estimated from the BET model with P/P0 below 0.04 applied for the MOFs and the PSD from the H–K model were determined using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 with nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms at 77 K up to 1 bar (P/P0 = 0–0.99). The morphology of the MOFs was obtained by SEM at 10 keV (JSM-7900F). The tapping mode AFM images were obtained using a Digital Instrument D3100CL. The FTIR spectra were measured on a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer. The characteristics of the solar cells were evaluated in ambient air under an AM1.5G AAA class solar simulator (XES-100S1, SAN-EI Electric. Co. Ltd.) with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. A Hamamatsu silicon solar cell (S1133) with a KG5 color filter, which is traced to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), was used as the reference cell. To calibrate the light intensity of the solar simulator, the power of the xenon lamp was adjusted to make the Jsc of the reference cell under simulated sunlight as high as it is under the calibration conditions. The J–V curves were measured using a Keithley digital source meter (Model 2400). Unless otherwise stated, the scan rate was set at 0.15 V s−1. The spectral response of the devices was determined by measuring the IPCE spectra from a xenon lamp through a monochromator onto the devices. As for the evaluation of the PD characteristics, the light intensity of the illumination system was first calibrated with an integrated sphere and double-checked with a Hamamatsu S1133 silicon diode before use. The devices were kept in a Faraday cage during the measurement to minimize noise produced by electromagnetic interference. The thickness of each layer was determined using a Tencor alpha-step 200 profiler.

Design, System, Application
The defect density in organometallic halide perovskites plays an important role in determining the overall photovoltaic performance. In this study, functional additives are incorporated into mixed lead–tin halide low-bandgap perovskites to improve their optoelectronic properties and stability. For a molecular design optimization strategy, MOFs are introduced to confine CH3NH3SnxPb1−xI3-based perovskite for better approximation between the perovskite and amino functionality, which is found to interact with uncoordinated Pb2+ or Sn2+ defects, leading to efficient trap-state passivation. In addition, MOF confinement can retard the permeation of moisture and oxygen into the perovskite films and thus alleviate the degradation. On the other hand, CTAB incorporation to ITIC shows an efficient anion-induced electron transfer, leading to a drastic enhancement in conductivity. We believe that the ideas demonstrated herein, including the incorporation of MOFs for defect passivation of lead–tin halide low-bandgap perovskites, as well as the addition of CTAB as the dopant for improving the electron extraction of the devices, have great future potential in low-bandgap perovskite photovoltaic applications.
