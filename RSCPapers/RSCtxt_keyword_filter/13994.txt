    , Accepted 13th April 2017First published on 17th April 2017AbstractThe synthesis of two new A–π–D–π–A molecules bearing a Zn-porphyrin core donor linked through cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene bridges to the electron-acceptor rhodanine (SA1) or dicyanovinylene (SA2) groups is described. The optical and electrochemical properties of these compounds are investigated. The horizontal conjugation of cyclopentadithiophene between the porphyrin core and the end-capping acceptor not only effectively increases the light harvesting between the Soret and Q bands of the porphyrin unit, but also optimizes molecular packing through linear π-conjugated backbones. Compounds SA1 and SA2 are employed as donors along with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as an acceptor in organic bulk heterojunction organic solar cells. After optimizing the processing of the active layer (a solvent additive and subsequent solvent vapor annealing), overall power conversion efficiencies of 6.71% and 7.93% (with low energy loss of 0.55 eV) are obtained for organic solar cells. The use of a solvent additive and subsequent solvent vapor annealing provide enhanced nanoscale morphology and bi-continuous interpenetrating networks in the active layer required for efficient exciton dissociation into free charge carriers and their subsequent transportation towards electrodes. This change led to higher PCE values when compared to devices based on as-cast active layers.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have received considerable attention owing to their potential application in flexible, lightweight and low cost solar energy conversion devices.1 The most widely used active layer architecture for efficient OSCs is the bulk heterojunction (BHJ), which consists of a mixture of a polymer or a small molecule as a donor and fullerene as an acceptor to form a nanoscale interpenetrating network morphology for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport.2 A great deal of effort has been focused on polymer-based OSCs and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of nearly 12% have been achieved for a single BHJ active layer and greater than 13% for multijunction cells by integrating state of the art technologies.3,4 These approaches include the synthesis of organic semiconducting donor and acceptor materials, optimization of BHJ active layers and interface engineering.
The design of efficient small molecules (SMs) as donor components for OSC devices involves the optimization of several parameters, including the nature of the donor and acceptor moieties to give appropriate frontier molecular orbitals for two reasons: (a) to lower the optical band gap and thus broaden the absorption of light, which leads to an increase in the short circuit current, and (b) to obtain as low a HOMO level as possible to achieve a high open circuit voltage. Furthermore, the solubility must be high enough for processing and extended conjugation is required to favor π-stacking to enhance intramolecular charge transfer.5 In recent years, SMs have attracted attention because of their ever increasing PCE values, which have reached levels of around 10% on employing single BHJ active layers.6 The increasing interest in SMs as donors in BHJ OSCs is also inspired by several potential advantages over their polymeric counterparts. These possible advantages include more reproducible synthesis, relative ease of purification and control over the energy levels and absorption profiles. The rapid advances in small molecule-based OSCs can be largely attributed to the sensible design of molecular structures. The mainstream design motifs for these small molecules involve a combination of electron-rich donor (D) and electron-deficient acceptor (A) units linked by a π-spacer in a symmetrical manner, e.g., A–π–D and D–π–A, to produce a small molecule with strong light harvesting ability, suitable energy levels and desirable film forming capability through solution processing.7
The push–pull effect of donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) systems depends on the strength of the donor and acceptor groups. However, this effect also depends on the conjugated π-system connecting the two units and a zwitterionic resonance structure should contribute to this.8 As the push–pull effect has a strong influence on the long-wavelength absorption in these systems (and therefore on the current of the device if used in photovoltaics), the nature of the π-conjugated bridge is very important for the efficiency of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. Although many combinations of different donors and acceptors have been investigated,9 less attention has been paid to the role of the π-conjugated connector between D and A units. In this respect, we recently described the application as donor molecules in BHJ solar cells of different A–π–D–π–A molecules in which thienylenevinylenes (TVs) were used as wires between the donors and acceptors.10–12 The exceptionally low values of the attenuation factor shown by TVs (β = 0.016 Å−1) favor excellent electronic coupling between the donor and acceptor moieties.13 In this sense, the semiconducting properties of cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT) based materials have attracted significant attention recently as they display extended conjugation, low bandgaps and high electrical conductivities.14 A comparison of rigidified spacers with their open chain analogues has shown that the bridging of double bonds significantly improves the intramolecular charge transfer and makes this kind of compound a potential candidate for organic electronics.15
Natural photosynthetic systems utilize chlorophylls to absorb light and carry out photochemical charge separation to store light energy. Porphyrins exhibit large absorption coefficients and their electrochemical and optical properties can be tuned by modification of the central metal and/or the introduction of suitable substituents at peripheral positions on the macrocycle. Porphyrins and their derivatives have been explored for a long time as sensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells, with the highest PCE value of 13% achieved.16 However, disappointing results were obtained in porphyrin-based BHJ solar cells before 2012 with only modest values obtained (below 1%).17 Nevertheless, in the last four years impressive progress has been made in the field of solution-processed BHJ OSC porphyrin-based small molecules due to the use of meso-ethynyl-linkages to enable maximum conjugation.18 Since this breakthrough remarkable efficiencies as high as 8.20% and 9.06% have been obtained.19,20 Our group recently prepared new A–π–D–π–A and D–π–A–π–D porphyrin-based donors that gave outstanding efficiencies of 7.63% and 8.03%, respectively.21,22
The work described here concerns the synthesis and properties of two novel A–π–D–π–A molecules, SA1 and SA2, based on Zn-porphyrin as a donor moiety linked through cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene with dicyanovinylene or rhodanine acceptor groups (Scheme 1).
 Scheme 1  Chemical structures of the new Zn-porphyrin-based molecules SA1 and SA2. 
The electrochemical and optical properties of the molecules were investigated and it was found that SA1 and SA2 can be employed as donors for BHJ OSCs. These new Zn-porphyrin-based molecules were used as donors for the fabrication of solution-processed BHJ OSCs in combination with PC71BM as the electron acceptor. The processing techniques for the active layer were optimized and included solvent addition followed by solvent vapor annealing. The resulting devices gave overall PCEs of 6.71% and 7.93% for SA1 and SA2, respectively.
Results and discussion
Theoretical calculations
The most stable theoretical geometries, electronic density contours and energy levels of the frontier molecular orbitals of SA1 and SA2 were initially calculated by density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP 6-31G* level in vacuo using Gaussian 09W. As depicted in Fig. S18 (ESI†), the π-conjugated system, i.e., the porphyrin ring-cyclopentadithiophene-acceptor, is completely flat according to the values of the dihedral angles (θ < 0.5°) calculated for both structures. This structure favors the conjugation between the porphyrin macrocycle and the electron acceptor moieties, thus allowing better electronic delocalization – as shown in the theoretical electronic density contours of the frontier molecular orbitals (Fig. S19, ESI†), which are delocalized over the entire molecule.
The HOMO and LUMO levels (Fig. S19, ESI†) are higher in SA1 than those in SA2 (SA1: HOMO = −5.00 eV; LUMO = −3.21 eV; SA2: HOMO = −5.17 eV; LUMO = −3.40 eV) and this difference is attributed to the higher withdrawing electron ability of the dicyanovinylene group with respect to the rhodanine moiety. Although high Voc values are expected in photovoltaic devices with PC71BM, a higher Voc should be expected for devices based on SA2, which has a lower HOMO energy.
Given the low HOMO–LUMO gap found for SA1 and SA2 (1.79 eV and 1.77 eV respectively) one would expect good absorption of light and, consequently, an excellent current in devices. Finally, efficient exciton dissociations at the D/A interface would be expected due to the offset between the LUMO of the donors and the LUMO of PC71BM (SA1: 0.79 eV; SA2: 0.60 eV).
Synthesis and characterization of SA1 and SA2
The synthesis of SA1 and SA2 is outlined in Scheme 2. Firstly, iodoaldehyde 2 was prepared in 92% yield by reaction of 1 with iodine and bistrifluoroacetoxyiodobenzene in CCl4 at room temperature.23,24
 Scheme 2  Synthesis of compounds SA1 and SA2. 
Zn-porphyrin 3 was reacted with 2 under Pd-catalyzed copper-free Sonogashira coupling conditions, using triphenylarsine and Pd2(dba)3 as the catalyst, to afford bisaldehyde 4 in 75% yield after purification by column chromatography (silica gel, hexane:CH2Cl2, 1:1). The target compounds were obtained by Knoevenagel condensation of 4 with 3-ethylrhodanine (SA1) or malononitrile (SA2) using piperidine or triethylamine as base, respectively. The compounds were purified by column chromatography and recrystallization from CH2Cl2:MeOH and both were obtained in excellent yields (SA1: 91% and SA2: 86%). All new compounds were satisfactorily characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, FT-IR and MALDI-TOF MS (for characterization details see the ESI†).
The thermal properties of SA1 and SA2 were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The TGA results for the studied compounds are shown in Fig. S14 (ESI†) and it can be seen that both have very high thermal stability, with decomposition observed at 387 °C and 400 °C, respectively.

In dichloromethane solution, the absorption spectra of both molecules cover the visible and reaching the near-IR region between 400 nm and 780 nm exhibiting two broad peaks with a valley at around 600 nm. The higher energy peak at around 530–540 nm corresponds to the Soret band, which is red-shifted with respect to the Soret band of pristine porphyrin (λmax = 435 nm) due to the extended conjugation. The lower energy band at around 725 nm is ascribed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition. It is worth noting that SA2 shows a broader ICT absorption band than SA1 and this can be attributed to the stronger electron-withdrawing character of the dicyanovinylene group when compared to 3-ethylrhodanine.
On comparing the spectra from solution to film, both compounds show a significant red shift in the absorption contours, which indicates strong intermolecular interactions leading to aggregation in the solid state (Fig. 1b). The conjugation of CDT can effectively increase the solar flux between the Soret and Q bands of porphyrin. This phenomenon may be associated with the end capping acceptors on both the porphyrin core and the CDT backbone promoting a much stronger intermolecular self-assembly in the solid state.25 The optical bandgaps estimated from the onset absorption edge observed in the absorption spectra of SA1 and SA2 are 1.53 eV and 1.45 eV, respectively.
The optical absorption spectra of the SA2:PC71BM active layer cast from CB, DIO/CB and after subsequent SVA are shown in Fig. 2. Similar absorption spectra were obtained for SA1:PC71BM blended films.
 Fig. 2  Optical absorption spectra of SA2:PC71BM thin films processed under different conditions. 
It can be seen from Fig. 2 that the absorption spectra of blended films show a broad band response covering the range 350–850 nm. This band consisted of the absorption bands corresponding to the porphyrin and PC71BM, indicating that both the porphyrin donor and PC71BM contribute to exciton generation and therefore photocurrent generation in the OSCs.
The electrochemical properties of SA1 and SA2 were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and osteryoung square wave voltammetry (OSWV) in o-DCB–acetonitrile (4:1) solution (see Table 1 and Fig. S15–S17, ESI†). The results obtained indicate that both molecules show comparable electrochemical behavior. In the anodic window, both molecules show two consecutive and reversible steps, with the first oxidation potential of SA1 lower than that of SA2 by 60 mV (0.20 V vs. 0.26 mV respectively). This difference can be attributed to the lower electron-withdrawing strength of the rhodanine moiety with respect to the cyanovinylene group. The reductions also proceed in a similar way and SA2 is easier to reduce (−1.42 V vs. −1.53 for SA1) for the reason given above. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of both molecules were estimated from the CV data (Table 1). The calculated energies of the HOMOs are −5.30 eV (SA1) and −5.35 eV (SA2); overall, high open circuit voltage (Voc) values are expected for devices constructed with these molecules. Finally, the HOMO–LUMO gaps, as determined from the electrochemical data, are as narrow as 1.73 and 1.68 eV for SA1 and SA2, respectively, suggesting good absorption of light in the visible region. The lower energy bandgap of SA2 relative to SA1 may be due to the end capping CN unit, which has stronger electron-withdrawing characteristics that lead to slight deepening of both the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of SA2 when compared to SA1. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of these porphyrins are compatible with PC71BM for efficient photo-induced charge transfer.
Photovoltaic properties
OSCs were fabricated with solution processed BHJ active layers using either SA1 or SA2 as donor materials and PC71BM as the acceptor material in a conventional architecture device structure (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN/Al). Chlorobenzene (CB) was used as the solvent for film deposition since CB has a high boiling point and slow evaporation of CB can facilitate the molecular assembly and formation of interpenetrated networks with good crystallinity. The weight ratio between the donor and the acceptor was optimized at 1:2 for both SA1 and SA2 devices and the thickness of the active layer was around 90 nm ± 5 nm. The photovoltaic parameters of the OSCs for the as cast (CB solution) SA1:PC71BM and SA2:PC71BM are summarized in Tables S1 and S2 (ESI†), respectively. The current–voltage characteristics of the OSCs based on the optimized active layers (with a donor to acceptor weight ratio of 1:2) processed with CB are shown in Fig. 3a. The photovoltaic device parameters are displayed in Table 2.

It can be seen from the results in Table 2 that the overall PCE for the SA2 (3.52%) device is higher than that for the device based on SA1 (2.73%). Having optimized the weight ratio in the active layer processed with CB, we proceeded to optimize the concentration of the solvent additive (DIO) (3 v%) in the host solvent. The effect of the volume concentration of DIO on the photovoltaic performance is summarized in Tables S3 and S4 (ESI†) for SA1 and SA2 based OSCs. This change gave rise to PCE values of 5.82% and 6.80% for SA1 and SA2, respectively, with significant improvements in both Jsc and FF (Table 2).
In order to further improve the PCE, the active layers were exposed to chloroform vapour for 60 s. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics under illumination intensity (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) of the optimized devices, i.e., DIO/CB/SVA, are shown in Fig. 3. The PCE of the device based on SA1 after the addition of 3 v% of DIO and subsequent chloroform solvent vapor annealing (SVA) showed a significantly improved value of 6.71% for SA1 with a Jsc of 13.38 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.85 and a FF of 0.59. Similarly, an improved value of 7.93% was obtained for SA2 with a Jsc of 13.84 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.91 V and a FF of 0.63. It can be seen from Fig. 2 that the intensity of the absorption band, which corresponds to the longer wavelength region, increased after the addition of DIO and SVA treatment. This indicates that such treatment effectively improves the self-assembly of the donor (porphyrins) and the crystallinity of the active layer and leads to enhancements in the Jsc and the FF. It can be seen from the results in Table 2 that all OSCs based on SA2, fabricated under different processing conditions, showed higher Voc values than those for SA1. This difference may be due to the deeper HOMO energy level caused by the stronger CN withdrawing unit, since the Voc of OSCs based on a BHJ active layer is directly related to the difference in the HOMO energy level of the donor and the LUMO energy level of the acceptor. Moreover, the energy loss (Eloss) defined as Eloss = Eg − qVoc, where Eg is the optical bandgap of the donor, for optimized SA2:PC71BM is as low as 0.55 eV and this may also be responsible for the high Voc.26
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) values of the optimized devices are shown in Fig. 3b. It can be seen that IPCE values of up to 66.5% were obtained from 350 to 850 nm under optimal conditions for an SA2:PC71BM-based device, which are higher than those for SA1:PC71BM under identical conditions. The Jsc values obtained from the integration of the IPCE spectra of the devices are around 13.25 mA cm−2 and 13.72 mA cm−2 for SA1:PC71BM and SA2:PC71BM devices, respectively, and these values are consistent with those obtained in the J–V characteristics under illumination. The IPCE spectrum of the SA2-based device is slightly broader than that of SA1 and this finding is consistent with the absorption spectra of the respective blends (Fig. 2).
In order to obtain information about the differences in the Jsc and FF values of the devices, we fabricated hole-only devices with the structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au. The dark J–V characteristics were measured to estimate the hole mobility of the active layer (Fig. 4) and the curves were fitted to the space charge limited current (SCLC) model to give estimated values of 2.31 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.12 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the as-cast blends of SA1:PC71BM and SA2:PC71BM, respectively.
 Fig. 4  Current–voltage characteristics of hole only devices based on active layers processed under different conditions (a) SA1:PC71BM and (b) SA2:PC71BM. 
The hole mobilities increased up to 9.95 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.03 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for SA1:PC71BM and SA2:PC71BM active layers, respectively, upon the addition of DIO and up to 1.09 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (SA1:PC71BM) and 1.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (SA2:PC71BM) after SVA under optimal conditions. The increase in the hole mobility upon either the solvent addition or subsequent SVA treatment results in a more balanced charge transport in the active layer. These results are consistent with higher Jsc and FF values for the SA2:PC71BM-based device.
We proceeded to investigate the variation in the photocurrent (Jph) with effective voltage (Veff) for the devices (Fig. 5) in an effort to evaluate the charge carrier transport and photocurrent extraction properties.27Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, whereas Veff is defined as Veff = Vo − Vappl, where Vappl is the external applied voltage and Vo is the voltage at which Jph is zero.
 Fig. 5  Variation of photocurrent density (Jph) with effective voltage (Veff) for the OSCs. 
The Veff value determines the electric field in the BHJ active layer and thereby can reflect the carrier transport and photocurrent extraction properties. When the Veff is sufficiently high, the Jph saturates and this suggests that all of the photogenerated excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers and subsequently collected by the electrodes.
In this case, the saturation photocurrent (Jphsat) is only limited by the total amount of absorbed incident photons and the ratio Jsc/Jphsat provides information about the product of exciton dissociation efficiency and charge collection efficiency.28 It can be seen in Fig. 5 that at high Veff, the Jph values for both of the optimal devices based on SA1 and SA2 reach very similar values of Jphsat. The values of Jsc/Jphsat under short circuit conditions are about 0.89 and 0.91 for SA1 and SA2 devices, respectively, and this suggests that both devices show high dissociation efficiency or charge collection efficiency. The higher value of Jsc/Jphsat for the SA2-based device indicates either a higher exciton dissociation efficiency or charge collection efficiency for the SA2 device relative to the SA1 counterpart. The exciton dissociation efficiency is related to the absorption profile of the active layer and, as can be seen from the absorption spectra of the active layers, SA2:PC71BM has a broader absorption profile compared to SA1:PC71BM – a finding that also confirms the higher generation of excitons in SA2-based devices. The higher charge collection efficiency for the SA2:PC71BM-based device also suggests that a lower bimolecular recombination is responsible for the improved FF.29 However, the Jph–Veff characteristics for the devices are significantly different at low Veff values. Under maximum output conditions, Jph/Jsat values are 0.72 and 0.81 for SA1 and SA2 devices, respectively, indicating suppressed bimolecular recombination in the latter device. The devices based on active layers processed with CB only show stronger field dependence across a large bias range and this becomes slightly saturated at 2.8 V, indicating dominant bimolecular recombination and leading to a low FF.30 However, the Jph values of the devices fabricated from DIO/CB or DIO/CB/SVA became saturated at much lower Veff values, which suggests that the photogenerated excitons can be efficiently dissociated into free charge carriers and subsequently collected at the electrode with suppressed bimolecular recombination, thus leading to enhanced FF values.31 The maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax) was estimated using Jphsat = qLGmax (where q is the electronic charge and L is the thickness of the active layer). The values obtained are 6.23 × 1027, 7.42 × 1027 and 8.67 × 1027 m3 s−1 for CB, DIO/CB and DIO/CB/SVA treated SA1:PC71BM layers, respectively, and 7.27 × 1027, 7.58 × 1027 and 9.56 × 1027 m3 s−1 for CB, DIO/CB and DIO/CB/SVA treated SA2:PC71BM layers, respectively. The steady increase in Gmax values with DIO/CB and subsequent SVA treatment can be attributed to the more ordered self-assembly of the porphyrin donor and the enhanced film morphology upon the addition of DIO and SVA.
The structural ordering and crystallinity of the active layer also play an important role in exciton dissociation, charge transport and subsequent collection by electrodes, thereby affecting the overall PCE of the OSCs. As a consequence, the active layers were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (see Fig. 6 for the SA2:PC71BM film).
 Fig. 6  X-ray diffraction patterns of the SA2:PC71BM thin film processed under different conditions. 
Similar XRD patterns were observed for SA1:PC71BM films. The as-cast SA1 blended film showed a diffraction peak at 2θ = 4.82° corresponding to a d-interspacing distance of 2.14 nm and a crystal size of 11.2 nm. The SA1 blended film processed with DIO showed a reduced spacing of 2.09 nm with an increased crystal size of 11.56 nm. The d-spacing was further reduced to 2.01 nm and the crystal size increased to 11.72 nm when the blend was processed with DIO/CB/SVA. The as cast SA2 blended film showed a diffraction peak at 2θ = 4.98° with a d-interspacing distance of 2.02 nm and a crystal size of 11.43 nm, whereas the DIO/CB and DIO/CB/SVA processed SA2 blended film showed lamellar d-interspacing/crystal sizes of 1.96 nm/11.58 nm and 1.89 nm/11.86 nm, respectively. Moreover, the diffraction peak intensities are much stronger for DIO/CB and DIO/CB/SVA processed blended films, thus demonstrating more ordered self-organization and increased crystallinity of the blended film. The more ordered lamellar structure of SA2 is beneficial for hole transport along the normal direction of the active layer. It can be seen from Fig. 6 that the π–π stacking peaks (010) at 2θ = 24.26° in these molecules are weak and broad and these correspond to a distance of 0.34 nm. The broad band may be due to the interference of the diffraction peak of PC71BM in the blended film. This value is quite small, which is beneficial for the strong intermolecular interactions and the reduced steric effect with the less bulky alkyl chain substituents. The small π–π stacking distance is favorable for charge transport and this results in a higher FF value.32 Moreover, it means that the SA2 and PC71BM molecular distribution in the active layer can be simultaneously adjusted by the DIO/CB/SVA treatment for better exciton dissociation and charge transport. It can be seen that for the active layer processed with either DIO/CB or DIO/CB/SVA, the diffraction intensity of the (010) peak was also enhanced, indicating that charge transport along the backbone and π–π stacking directions is more efficient in these blend active layer.
Nanoscale phase separation with a bi-continuous interpenetrating network plays a crucial role in determining the performance of the OSCs. It is well known that excessive phase separation is favorable to charge transport but limits the exciton dissociation. However, fine mixing or very small domain size is more conductive for exciton dissociation, but limits the charge transport.33 In order to verify the influence of DIO/CB and subsequent SVA on the morphology of the blend film, transmission electron microscopy characterization was employed and is shown in Fig. S20 (ESI†). The bright and dark regions in the TEM images correspond to the donor rich and acceptor rich domains, respectively due to their different electron densities. It can be seen from Fig. 7a that there is poor phase separation between SA2 and PC71BM when the blend film is processed with CB, limiting the charge transport, leading to low values of FF and Jsc resulting in the low value of PCE. However, the TEM image of the blend film cast from the DIO/CB solvent showed increased domain size, keeping the smooth surface due to molecular aggregation induced by the high boiling point of DIO and further slightly increased upon subsequent SVA treatment. This would contribute to the enhancement in both Jsc and FF values due to improved exciton as well as charge transport.
 Fig. 7  AFM height images (size 3 mm × 3 mm) (a and c) and phase images (b and d) for SA2:PC71BM processed with CB and DIO/CB/SVA, respectively. 
The AFM images of the CB cast DIO/CB/SVA treated SA2:PCBM are shown in Fig. 7. It can be seen from AFM height images that the CB cast film showed a relatively smooth with a root mean square (RMS) of about 0.72 nm; however, with the DIO/CB/SVA treated film the RMS value has been increased to 1.24 nm, indicating that a more ordered packing behavior was observed in the active layer. It can be seen from the AFM phase images, the DIO/CB/SVA treated film, the aggregation size is slightly larger than the CB cast counterpart, indicating that the arrangement of molecules is more ordered. The better phase separation and proper aggregation size could be beneficial for improving the device performance.
Conclusions
In summary, two new porphyrin small molecules with the same Zn-porphyrin donor core and different end-capping acceptors, i.e., rhodanine (SA1) or dicyanovinylene (SA2), linked through cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene bridges have been designed and synthesized. The optical and electrochemical properties of these materials were investigated for their potential application as donors in conjunction with PC71BM as an electron acceptor for solution processed bulk heterojunction OSCs. Both SA1 and SA2 showed absorption profiles from the visible to near infrared region and they had suitable frontier energy levels for exciton dissociation and charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor and vice versa in the BHJ active layer employed in OSCs. After optimizing the weight ratio between the donor (SA1 or SA2) and PC71BM, solvent addition and subsequent solvent vapor annealing, the PCE values of 6.94% and 8.19% (with low energy loss of 0.55 eV) were achieved for SA1 and SA2 OSCs, respectively. The improvement in the PCE of OSCs based on an active layer processed with the addition of DIO and subsequent SVA is related to the efficient photogenerated exciton dissociation and charge collection due to the favorable nanoscale morphology induced by external treatments.

Device fabrication and characterization
Indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 10–12 Ω cm−2 were thoroughly cleaned prior to device fabrication by soaking in detergent solution followed by ultrasonication in deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol sequentially for 15 min. The substrates were dried under vacuum overnight and a 40 nm thick poly(styrenesulfonate)–doped poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT:PSS) (Bayer Baytron 4083) layer was spin-coated on the ITO-coated glass substrates at 2500 rpm for 30 s. The substrates were dried at 110 °C for 10 min in air. The active layers were spun from solutions of SA1 or SA2:PC71BM at different weight ratios of 1:1, 1:1.5, 1:2 and 1:2.5 with an overall concentration of 16 mg mL−1 from CB or DIO/CB as solvents. Solvent vapour annealing (SVA) of active layers spin coated from solution in a blend of DIO/CB with a weight ratio of 1:2 was carried out by placing the substrate in a glass petri dish containing 0.3 mL CHCl3 for 60 s. The thin PFN layer was spin coated from solution at a concentration of 1.5 mg mL−1 on top of the active layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, the aluminum (Al) top electrode was thermally deposited on the active layer under a vacuum of 10−5 Torr through a shadow mask area of 20 mm2. All devices were fabricated and tested in an ambient atmosphere without encapsulation. The hole-only devices with architectures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au were also fabricated in a similar way in order to measure the hole mobility. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the BHJ organic solar cells were measured using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter in the dark and under a simulated AM1.5G illumination of 100 mW cm−2. A xenon light source coupled with an optical filter was used to provide stimulated irradiance at the surface of the devices. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of the devices was measured by illuminating the devices using the light source and a monochromator and the resulting current was measured using a Keithley electrometer under short-circuit conditions.
