    , Accepted 16th December 2020First published on 16th December 2020AbstractAmmonia is the main precursor for the production of fertilizers, a hydrogen energy carrier and an emerging clean fuel that plays a crucial role in sustaining life on the globe. Herein, hybrid MoSe2@g-C3N4 micro/nanostructures are described that can serve as photoelectrochemical (PEC) catalysts to fix N2 into NH3 in a basic electrolyte at a low potential (−0.3 V vs. RHE) under ambient conditions. In situ functionalization of the hierarchical micro/nanoflowers of MoSe2 with exfoliated g-C3N4 nanosheets dramatically boosts the faradaic efficiency and yield rate up to 28.91% and 7.72 μmol h−1 cm−2 respectively. The high PEC activity can be attributed to the hierarchical architecture, light-harvesting capability, tunable active sites and formation of heterojunctions, as confirmed by various characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Therefore, this work not only develops an effective procedure to obtain hierarchical heterojunction catalysts towards a high-efficiency NRR but also provides a deep understanding of artificial N2 fixation at the MoSe2@g-C3N4 interface.
1. Introduction
Fixation of naturally available nitrogen (N2) into ammonia (NH3) provides considerable assurance for sustainable life on earth.1 Owing to an ever-increasing population, the large demand for NH3 has developed into an impending societal problem that stimulates rigorous research on synthetic NH3 production technology.2,3 NH3 is mainly used as feedstock for fertilizers, chemical and pharmaceutical production and zero-carbon emission fuel.3–5 Currently, on an industrial scale, NH3 is produced through the renowned Haber–Bosch process from N2 and H2 precursors using Fe-based catalysts under harsh temperature (350–550 °C) and pressure (150–350 bar) conditions while mostly hydrogen is obtained through steam reforming of fossil fuels.6–8 Steam reforming also makes it a highly energy-intensive and environmentally unfriendly process due to the enormous carbon footprint (>1% of the global CO2 emissions).9,10 Thus, there is a great need to develop alternative sustainable, economical and efficient processes for NH3 production under ambient conditions using renewable energy resources which can simultaneously reduce the operating temperature, pressure, and CO2 emissions.8,11
To date, many pioneering studies and numerous efforts have been devoted to promoting the NH3 synthesis, including electrocatalysis,11–18 photocatalysis,19 and biological2 N2 fixation strategies. Among them, the solar energy-driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) N2 reduction reaction (NRR) for NH3 synthesis in an ambient environment is particularly promising and has been paid considerable attention during the past few years.20–22 The PEC approach is of great importance because it incorporates the benefits of photocatalytic and electrocatalytic processes23 that not only facilitate a more efficient NRR under an applied external bias potential but can also be driven by solar power.24 Unlike electrocatalysis,14,15 photocatalysis,19 and biological2 N2 fixation strategies, the photoelectrochemical route for N2 reduction to NH3 offers several advantages: (i) reduction and oxidation products are generated in different cells, which eases the product quantification and separation and (ii) the photoelectrocatalytic performance can be improved due to the increase in redox capabilities of photoexcited charge carriers and electronic state redistribution equilibrium of catalysts for the desired reactions through applied electrical bias.25,26 Moreover, in the photoelectrochemical process, catalysts are dispersed on the electrode as electroactive materials; whereas in photocatalysis, catalysts are usually dispersed in the reaction solution. The efficacy of the PEC process is closely linked to the electronic structure, components, surface morphology of catalysts, and separation efficiency of photoinduced charge carriers.7,27 So far, catalytic systems including MoS2@TiO2 heterostructure,28 plasmon-enhanced black silicon nanostructures,29 g-C3N5/BiOBr heterostructure,21 and black phosphorus22 have been reported for the PEC NRR. However, from an elemental point of view, transition metal-based selenides are still unexplored for the photoelectrocatalytic NRR based on the extent of our knowledge.
Molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) is a layered transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) with a narrow bandgap and tunable morphology, and is expected to meet the basic requirements for photo/electrocatalytic N2 fixation,30–32 since it was reported that Mo has remarkable active sites for N2 reduction under ambient conditions, particularly for electrochemical NH3 synthesis.1 Moreover, the photo/electrochemical (PEC) performance of MoSe2 would be further improved by coupling with other 2D semiconductors for effective light-harvesting and charge separation by virtue of synergistic interactions and formation of heterojunctions. Polymeric g-C3N4 is an environmentally friendly, low cost, highly stable and metal-free photoactive catalyst that has a carbon and nitrogen-enriched 2D graphite-like framework.33–35 The presence of pyridinic/pyrrolic nitrogen atoms and the electron-withdrawing capability of g-C3N4 make the adjacent carbon atoms positively charged that facilitates the adsorption of intermediates.36–38 DFT calculations indicated that the electron-withdrawing characteristics of pyrrolic and pyridinic nitrogen atoms afford coordination anchoring sites for N2 adsorption and their contents are vital for promoting NH3 synthesis.38 In addition, g-C3N4 has been explored for a wide variety of energy conversion applications like CO2,39 O2 and O3 (ref. 40) reduction. Unluckily, pristine g-C3N4 suffers from the relatively smaller surface area, poor conductivity and weak separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers.41–43 In order to overcome the aforementioned problems, the coupling of g-C3N4 with semiconductors is an efficient approach to increase the overall catalytic activity. Numerous hybrids, such as Co(OH)2/g-C3N4,42 CoMn-LDH/g-C3N4,43 g-C3N4/TiO2,44 Ag–AgVO3/g-C3N4,45 B/g-C3N4 (ref. 46) and α-Fe2O3/g-C3N4 (ref. 47) have been prepared to enhance the photo/electrocatalytic performance.
Hierarchically structured materials present promising applications in many fields including photo/electrocatalysis and energy storage and conversion owing to their tunable micro/nanostructures, large surface area, additional accessible active sites, and enhanced mass transport and light-harvesting capability.48–53 For example, the hierarchy of morphological levels induces the light scattering effect, which allows deep light penetration and increases light absorption through multiple internal reflections onto the surface of catalysts, and consequently enhances the photocatalytic efficiency.52,54–57 Furthermore, the effects of visible light illumination on the photo/electrocatalytic performance are still the focus of the scientific community.58 It is expected that the structural tuning of materials offers the opportunity to design and develop new catalysts with exclusive micro/nanostructures for an efficient NRR. Thus, there is much scope to develop unique, non-noble metal-based hierarchical architectures with more accessible active sites and high surface area towards PEC N2 fixation under ambient conditions.
In this work, we report the fabrication of hierarchical flower-like MoSe2@g-C3N4 micro/nanostructures via a facile and scalable in situ hydrothermal method (Scheme 1a). The MoSe2@g-C3N4 hybrids show a high-efficiency PEC NRR performance under room temperature and pressure, with a high NH3 yield of 7.72 μmol h−1 cm−2 and FE of 28.91% at −0.3 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. The high PEC activity is due to the synergistic interactions and formation of hierarchical heterojunctions between MoSe2 and g-C3N4. The high light-harvesting capability, synergistic interactions and efficient redox activity could also enrich the accessible active sites and enhance the mass/charge transport. Thus, this work not only demonstrates that TMDC based hybrid materials could serve as potential PEC NRR catalysts to replace expensive noble systems, but also provides a sustainable approach to understand and develop efficient catalysts in the field of artificial N2 fixation.

2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Chemicals including sodium molybdate dihydrate (Na2MoO4·2H2O), selenium (Se) powder, sodium borohydride (NaBH4 A.R), salicylic acid (C7H6O3), sodium hypochlorite solution (NaClO), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sodium nitroferricyanide dihydrate (C5FeN6Na2O·2H2O), sodium citrate (Na3C6H5O7), hydrazine hydrate (N2H4·H2O), and para-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde (p-C9H11NO) were purchased from Macklin. Dicyandiamide (C2H4N4 A.R), sodium sulfate (Na2SO4 A.R), potassium hydroxide (KOH A.R), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), ethyl alcohol (C2H5OH A.R), acetone (CH3COCH3 A.R) and the Nafion membrane were acquired from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent (Beijing Co. Ltd.). Moreover, deuterium oxide (D2O) was procured from Beijing Huawei Ruike Chemical Co., Ltd. 15N2 (99 atom%), was purchased from Wuhan Newradar Special Gas Co., Ltd. Deionized (DI) water was utilized during the experimentation. All reagents were used without additional purification.
2.2 Fabrication of bulk g-C3N4
Bulk g-C3N4 was synthesized by direct pyrolysis of C2H4N4 in a tube furnace. 10 g of C2H4N4 was ground into a fine powder, placed in a ceramic combustion boat and calcined at 520 °C for 4 h under argon (Ar) flow at a heating rate of 2.5 °C min−1. After cooling, 6 g of light-yellow agglomerated solid was obtained and milled into fine powder in an agate mortar.
2.3 Preparation of g-C3N4 nanosheets
Exfoliation and preparation of as-synthesized bulk g-C3N4 were performed according to a reported method with few modifictions.59 In a typical procedure, 1.4 g of bulk g-C3N4 was mixed in a 100 mL flask containing 15 mL of concentrated H2SO4 (98 wt%) and continuously stirred for 15 min. Afterward, 1 mL of distilled water was added dropwise under constant stirring, and the temperature of the suspension rapidly increased to 60 °C due to the simultaneous exothermic process. Furthermore, 5 mL water was again added dropwise into the suspension to maintain the suspension temperature constant for 10 min, and gradually the suspension color changed from light yellow to milky white. In order to remove residual acid and unexfoliated g-C3N4 residue, the resulting milky white suspension was poured into 500 mL distilled water and stirred for 5 min, and then centrifuged at 3000 revolutions per minute (rpm). The collected product was redispersed into 500 mL distilled water, ultrasonicated for 5 min, and centrifuged at 7500 rpm, to eliminate any unexfoliated g-C3N4, and the aforementioned washing method was repeated several times. The supernatant was collected, and concentrated in a rotary evaporator at 60 °C under low pressure resulting in a dense suspension. Furthermore, 0.9 g exfoliated g-C3N4 nanosheets were obtained by drying the suspension at 60 °C under vacuum for 16 h.
2.4 Fabrication of MoSe2@g-C3N4 hybrids
MoSe2@g-C3N4 hybrids were synthesized by varying the concentration of g-C3N4 (1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 wt%) through a facile, scalable hydrothermal method. For example, during the synthesis of the MoSe2@g-C3N4 (1 wt%) hybrid, 0.01596 g of g-C3N4 was added into a beaker containing 25 mL of absolute ethanol and distilled water mixture (volume ratio 1:1). Dispersion of g-C3N4 nanosheets was assisted by ultrasonication for 2 h. Sequentially, 0.8225 g of Na2MoO4·2H2O and 0.7746 g Se powder were dissolved in the ethanol/water mixture containing dispersed g-C3N4 nanosheets under vigorous stirring for 5 min. After complete dissolution of Na2MoO4·2H2O, 0.1296 g of NaBH4 was also added to reduce the Se under vigorous stirring for an additional 5 min. Upon reduction, the mixture color changed from light brown to reddish-brown. Afterward, the obtained mixture was transferred to a 45 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, sealed firmly and kept at 200 °C for 48 h, and then the mixture was cooled to 25 °C. The suspension was centrifuged and the precipitates obtained were washed with distilled water and absolute ethanol more than 5 times. Moreover, the as-synthesized black precipitates were dehydrated for 12 h in a vacuum oven at 60 °C and a black powder was obtained. The same procedure was repeated to prepare the remaining hybrids by keeping the fixed amount of Na2MoO4·2H2O and Se powder precursors and only varying the g-C3N4 concentration. For comparison, pure MoSe2 was also synthesized by following the same procedure without using exfoliated g-C3N4. The obtained powder was ground for 30 min and calcined at 450 °C for 3 h in a tube furnace under Ar gas.
2.5 Preparation of the working electrodes
10 mg of MoSe2 was dispersed in 750 μL water, 250 μL ethanol and 40 μL Nafion solution, and sonicated for 1 h to form a uniform ink (suspension); the same procedure was followed for all other catalysts. In this study, carbon paper substrates of area 1 × 1 cm2 were used to prepare all electrodes (mass loading of catalyst 1 mg cm−2). For all control potential measurements, the drop-casting method was used to prepare electrodes by pouring the as-synthesized suspension on individual carbon paper, finally followed by air-drying.
2.6 Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) of all specimens was performed using a “Shimadzu XRD-6000 diffractometer” equipped with a graphite-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1542 nm) source operating at 40 kV and 30 mA. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) morphological images and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) maps were acquired on a “ZEISS SUPRA 55 instrument” with an acceleration voltage of 20 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) measurements were conducted using Al Kα radiation (Thermo VG ESCALAB MK II) and the positions of all curves were corrected using the C 1s line at 284.8 eV. Curve fitting and background subtraction were performed using XPS software PEAK 41. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEOL JEM-2010F) was performed for imaging at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The UV-vis spectrum was obtained using a TU-1900 spectrophotometer, PERSEE. Thermogravimetric analysis (Pyris 1 TGA) was conducted under air flow from 50 to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were obtained using a Jobin Yvon FluoroMax-4 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a 150 W, Xe lamp.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structures and compositions
The crystalline nature and phase purity of g-C3N4, MoSe2, and MoSe2@g-C3N4 hybrids with different ratios were investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). In the case of pristine g-C3N4, two main characteristics peaks at 13° (001) and 27.4° (002) are observed, consistent with the in-plane structural packing and interlayer assembly with conjugated aromatic arrangements respectively, indicating a high degree of graphitization (Fig. 1a and S1†).43,60 For hexagonal MoSe2 (Fig. 1a and S1†), peaks at 14.8°, 27.4°, 33.7°, 41.9°, 46.6°, 54.7° and 66.4° are ascribed to the diffractions of (002), (004), (100), (103), (105), (110) and (200) planes respectively, and are also well-matched with the standard results (JCPDS: 20-0757). Upon hybridization between the two phases with different ratios, all MoSe2@g-C3N4 hybrids hold a similar pattern to the pure MoSe2 without obvious g-C3N4 peaks, which can be attributed to the high dispersion of the g-C3N4 phase. Moreover, it could also be inferred that the crystal growth of MoSe2 has not been restricted in the presence of g-C3N4 nanosheets during the formation of MoSe2@g-C3N4 hybrids.
 Fig. 1  (a) PXRD spectra of g-C3N4, MoSe2 and MoSe2@g-C3N4 hybrids, (b) TGA curves of MoSe2 and MoSe2@g-C3N4 hybrids. 
Thermal analysis was performed on both the MoSe2 and MoSe2@g-C3N4 (typically, 7 wt% and 11 wt%) hybrids. MoSe2 and MoSe2@g-C3N4 hybrids show initial weight loss below 100 °C due to the removal of surface adsorbed water molecules, and then a two-step degradation procedure occurs from 100 to 350 °C, owing to the intercalated water molecules removal within the MoSe2 nanosheets. The prominent weight loss from 350 to 500 °C can be attributed to partial decomposition, phase transformation of MoSe2 and decomposition of g-C3N4 nanosheets (Fig. 1b). Furthermore, different weight losses of ca. 7.21%, 9.73%, and 10.88% are observed for pure MoSe2, MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) and MoSe2@g-C3N4 (11 wt%) hybrids ranged from 50 to 600 °C, which are consistent with different amounts of g-C3N4 in the hybrids (Fig. 1b).
3.2 Micro/nanostructures of MoSe2@g-C3N4
The morphological and structural features of the as-synthesized MoSe2 and MoSe2@g-C3N4 hybrids were estimated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The pristine MoSe2 exhibits uniform hierarchical micro-flowers containing numerous petal-like nanosheets with a size ranging from ∼150 to 300 nm and thickness of ∼17 to 21 nm (Fig. 2a, b and S2†). Such massive nanosheets could provide a high specific surface area and enormous available active sites for further efficient PEC catalysis. SEM images of MoSe2@g-C3N4 hybrids reveal that g-C3N4 is uniformly dispersed on the surface of hierarchical microflowers of MoSe2 (Fig. 2c–f). In the case of the MoSe2@g-C3N4 (3 wt%) hybrid, g-C3N4 is almost invisible due to its low concentration and good dispersion (Fig. 2c), while for the MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%), the exfoliated g-C3N4 nanosheets appear on MoSe2 hierarchical microflowers due to adequate loading of g-C3N4 (Fig. 2d and e). As the content of g-C3N4 increases in the hybrid, it covers the hierarchical microflowers, which may reduce the surface area as observed for MoSe2@g-C3N4 (11 wt%) (Fig. 2f). The higher amount of g-C3N4 on MoSe2 promotes the agglomeration tendency of nanosheets; and thereby may reduce the effective surface area and the active sites for PEC reaction. Moreover, it is observed that all elements like Mo, Se, C, and N in pure MoSe2 and the MoSe2@g-C3N4 hybrid (7 wt%) are highly uniform and homogeneously dispersed, as confirmed by EDS profiles (Fig. S3 and S4†).
 Fig. 2  SEM images of (a and b) MoSe2, (c) the MoSe2@g-C3N4 (3 wt%) hybrid, (d and e) the MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) hybrid, (f) the MoSe2@g-C3N4 (11 wt%) hybrid, and (g) the EDS map of the MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) hybrid. 
A detailed insightful view of the MoSe2@g-C3N4 hierarchical flower-like structure is obtained by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 3a, b). Taking MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) as an example, TEM images confirm the existence of two obvious phases as well as uniform localization of g-C3N4 nanosheets onto the hierarchical microflowers of MoSe2 (Fig. 3b). In the case of MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%), lattice fringes with a d-spacing of 0.28 nm and 0.65 nm correspond to the (100) and (002) planes of MoSe2 respectively, in which the d-spacing (0.28 nm) corresponds to the (002) plane of g-C3N4, and thus indicates the lamellar heterostructure of the hybrid (Fig. 3c and d). Moreover, TEM analysis of pure g-C3N4 exfoliated nanosheets is shown in Fig. S5a and b,† whereas the dark area of images represents the agglomeration of g-C3N4 exfoliated nanosheets.

3.3 XPS analysis of MoSe2@g-C3N4
The chemical bonding, valence states and binding energies of the as-synthesized g-C3N4, MoSe2 and MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) hybrid were analyzed through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. 4 and S7†). A full-scan XPS pattern of the MoSe2@g-C3N4 hybrid indicates the presence of all elements O, C, N, Mo and Se (Fig. 4a).
 Fig. 4  (a) Full-scan XPS of g-C3N4, MoSe2 and MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%), (b) Mo 3d spectra of MoSe2 and MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%), (c) C 1s spectra of g-C3N4, MoSe2 and MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%), and (d) N 1s spectra of g-C3N4, MoSe2 and MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%). 
In the full-scan XPS of pure MoSe2 and the MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) hybrid, peaks at 232.37 and 232.12 eV can be attributed to the Mo 3d3/2 (Mo4+ state) (Fig. 4b).61,62 The peaks positioned at 229.12 and 228.97 eV (Fig. 4b) are ascribed to the 3d5/2 (Mo4+ valence state) of pure MoSe2 and the MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) hybrid respectively.61,62 The binding energy of the MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) hybrid is slightly lower compared to that of the pure MoSe2, and such negative shifts in the Mo 3d3/2 (0.25 eV) and Mo 3d5/2 (0.15 eV) binding energies represent the synergistic effects of g-C3N4 due to the electron-withdrawing coupling effect and strong chemical interaction in heterojunctions between MoSe2 and g-C3N4.63
High-resolution C 1s spectra of g-C3N4, MoSe2, and the MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) hybrid are presented in Fig. 4c. For g-C3N4, the peaks located at 283.52, 284.8 and 286.22 eV are ascribed to the C–H, CC, and C–O bonds respectively. For the MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) hybrid, three new peaks appear at 285.12, 287.82 and 288.17 eV which can be assigned to the CN bond, N–CO bond and C–N–C surface coordination respectively.
The N 1s spectra of g-C3N4 and the MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) hybrid can be deconvoluted into pyridinic, pyrrolic, and graphitic nitrogen atoms that could be recognized by their binding energy at 398.37, 399 and 400.57 eV respectively. For pyridinic N atoms of the MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) hybrid, a positive shift of 0.36 eV (Fig. 4d) in binding energy is observed compared to g-C3N4, indicating the chemical interaction and proper dispersion of the g-C3N4 nanosheets on hierarchical microflowers of MoSe2.64 For pure MoSe2, no apparent peak of nitrogen was observed in N 1s spectra due to the absence of elemental nitrogen in pure MoSe2. Compared with the pure MoSe2, the MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) hybrid shows four new peaks at 394.52, 395.27, 397.65 and 401.72 eV, which are attributed to the MoOx/MoNx, Mo 3p3/2, Mo–N and quaternary N atoms respectively. The formation of Mo–N species can be attributed to the strong chemical interactions of MoSe2 and g-C3N4 that enhance conductivity within the material and might lead to effective active sites.65,66 Additionally, the presence of MoOx/MoNx species is advantageous in terms of providing active sites for the NRR.63,67 Such physical and chemical interactions in MoSe2 and g-C3N4 are beneficial in terms of inducing catalytic active sites and effective charge transportation within the heterojunctions during PEC N2 fixation. Furthermore, in Se 3d XPS spectra, Se 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 states, the peaks occur at 54.3 eV and 53.4 eV respectively, confirming the Se2− oxidation state of Se in both MoSe2 and MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) hybrids (Fig. S7†).
3.4 PEC performance of MoSe2@g-C3N4
The PEC activity of the catalysts is generally related to the efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers. Therefore, photoluminescence (PL) spectra are acquired for further confirmation of interfacial charge transfer, recombination rate and separation efficiency of photoinduced charge carriers on the g-C3N4 and MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) surfaces (Fig. 5a). Strong PL emission of g-C3N4 is observed which indicates the fast charge recombination rate, whereas weak PL intensity of MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) signifies the low reunion of photogenerated charge carriers owing to the formation of heterojunctions and transfer of photoexcited electrons from the g-C3N4 to MoSe2 hierarchical nano/microflowers. PL decay time for g-C3N4 and MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) is determined by data fitting in a two-exponential model68 while the respective fluorescence lifetimes were determined using decay profiles (Table S1†) through the following equation.69  where “τ” represents the average lifetime, “Bi” is the exponential factor while “τi” is the decay time of the individual components. The average fluorescence lifetime values of g-C3N4 and MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) are 2.548 and 11.001 ns, respectively (Fig. S6†). The MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) heterostructures demonstrate a 4.3 times higher average fluorescence lifetime than g-C3N4 indicating the enhanced separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers of heterostructures.

Transient open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) analysis was further performed to study the recombination behavior of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Open circuit voltage (potential) is usually generated from photo-induced electrons and holes in the conduction band and valence band respectively. Upon excitation, the voltage increases due to the excited charge carriers, and open-circuit potential becomes gradually stable under continuous visible light irradiation; while upon turning off the light, potential drops owing to the reunion of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.70 As shown in Fig. 5b, the MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) hybrid shows enhanced photovoltage compared to both the pristine g-C3N4 and MoSe2, demonstrating that the MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) hybrid effectively facilitates the separation of photoinduced electron–hole pairs. Furthermore, a delayed lifetime of the MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) hybrid (1.363 times than that of pure MoSe2) represents that the photoinduced charge carriers in MoSe2 are quickly trapped by g-C3N4, which reduces the photogenerated charge carrier recombination rate, thus increasing the lifetime of photoinduced charge carriers (Fig. S8†). In the pristine g-C3N4 and MoSe2, the photo-generated charge carriers exhibit a fast recombination rate and consequently reduced photocurrent generation due to hindrance in electron transfer from the anode to the cathode. The prolonged lifetime of carriers for the MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) hybrid indicates more efficient interfacial transfer and separation of photoexcited electron–hole pairs due to the 2D semiconductor heterojunctions.
To get more insight about photocatalytic activity, UV-vis absorption of g-C3N4 and the MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) hybrid was studied (Fig. 5c and d). g-C3N4 shows absorption in the blue region of the visible light spectrum while the absorption edge of the MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) heterostructure shows a red-shift, indicating the enhanced light absorption capability of the hybrid in the visible region (Fig. 5c). The bandgap energy of 2.69 eV and 2.45 eV can be obtained from the UV-vis absorption spectra of g-C3N4 and MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) respectively (Fig. 5d). The red-shift of the MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) absorption edge signifies the reduced bandgap energy as a result of the high light-harvesting capability and excessive photo-generation of charge carriers within the heterojunctions. Therefore, the PEC performance of hierarchical micro/nanoflowers of MoSe2@g-C3N4 heterojunctions can be illustrated in Scheme 1b.
Transient photocurrent responses were investigated on visible light illumination to discover the plausible PEC mechanism (Fig. 5e). All aforementioned photo/electrocatalysts show a prompt response against light on–off cycles, in which the photocurrent density increases upon irradiation and then returns to a constant value while it swiftly decreases once the light is turned off. The highest photocurrent densities of 0.0273, 0.0551 and 0.0719 mA cm−2 were observed for g-C3N4, MoSe2 and MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) respectively (Fig. 5e). The photocurrent density of the MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) hybrid is 1.304 times higher than that of MoSe2, indicating that the heterojunctions suppress the reunion of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and increase interfacial charge transfer that demonstrates improved PEC activity under visible light irradiation.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the g-C3N4, MoSe2 and MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) hybrid was performed to gain further insight into photogenerated charge carrier recombination and the charge transfer phenomenon (Fig. 5f). The arc radii of EIS demonstrate the conductivity, electron transfer resistance and charge separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs taking place over the surface of catalysts. The small arc radius of Nyquist plots indicates the low interfacial charge transfer resistance and high separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers, while the large arc radius indicates a low charge transfer rate, easy recombination, and poor separation efficiency at the surface. The values of charge transfer resistance (Rct) and resistance of solution (Rs) were determined and compared to the equivalent circuit values of Nyquist plots while the CPE (constant phase element) is an equivalent electrical circuit component (inset of Fig. 5f). Arc radii of Nyquist plots correspond to Rct of the as-synthesized PEC catalysts. The Rct values are estimated as 226.58, 120.5 and 69.53 Ω for g-C3N4, MoSe2 and the MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) hybrid respectively upon visible light irradiation. The MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) hybrid shows an extremely smaller arc radius, indicating a high charge transfer and separation efficiency, which makes it suitable for PEC N2 fixation. Based on the aforementioned results, MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) exhibits enhanced PEC activity and cooperative effect, which can be further confirmed by the NRR experiments under visible light irradiation.
3.5 PEC NRR of MoSe2@g-C3N4
The PEC N2 reduction to NH3 was carried out in a two-compartment H-type cell separated by the Nafion membrane (cation exchange and proton-conducting effects) under ambient conditions using the MoSe2@g-C3N4 hybrid as the photo/electrocathode. The NRR is a typical hydrogenation process, in which N2 gas adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst in the cathode and reacted with freely moving H+ in the electrolyte to produce NH3. The Nafion membrane only permits the H+ transmission from the anodic to the cathodic chamber while hindering the NH3 diffusion to the anodic chamber of the cell. Two key reactions take place in cell compartments: in the anodic reaction chamber, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is dominant in which H2O splits into H+ and O2, while H+ constantly moves towards the cathodic reaction chamber (eqn (1)). 3H2O → 6H+ + 1.5O2 + 6e−(1)
In the cathodic reaction chamber, H+ from the electrolyte comes close to N2 and forms NH3 molecules by potentiostatic reduction (eqn (2)). The overall cathodic reaction can be expressed as follows: N2 + 6H+ + 6e− → 2NH3(2)
Montoya et al. discovered that numerous catalysts kinetically support the HER over the NRR,71 because the standard electrochemical potential of H+ reduction reaction is near to that of the NRR. Thus, the HER is the substantial kinetic barrier to the NRR that decreases the selectivity and efficiency of the PEC NH3 synthesis. However, the HER is a pH-dependent process; in basic electrolytes, HER current can decrease by nearly two orders of magnitude compared to that in acidic electrolytes.71,72 The pH dependence of NRR kinetics is not fully explored yet, and herein we consider three typical electrolytes namely acidic (0.05 M H2SO4), neutral (0.1 M Na2SO4) and basic (0.1 M KOH) to explore the suitable one for N2 fixation on pure MoSe2 cathodes at applied voltages from 0 to −0.5 V vs. RHE for 2 h under ambient conditions. The NH3 formed in the cathode chamber is absorbed in the corresponding electrolyte and quantified at the termination of each electrolysis process using calibration curves established for basic, acidic and neutral electrolytes through the indophenol blue method (Fig. S9–S11†). The average maximum NH3 yield rate of 1.19 μmol h−1 cm−2 and FE of 3.03% in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte are observed at −0.3 V vs. RHE, while those in 0.05 M H2SO4 electrolyte (NH3 yield rate = 0.4 μmol h−1 cm−2, FE = 0.45%) and 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution (NH3 yield rate = 0.29 μmol h−1 cm−2, FE = 1.54%) are relatively lower under ambient conditions without light illumination (Fig. S12–S14†). Thus, 0.1 M KOH electrolyte is an optimal condition to further perform the PEC NRR due to its NRR facilitation and exceptional HER suppression capability. Moreover, no significant variations were observed in the pH values of electrolytes in both compartments (cathodic and anodic) of the catalytic cell after the PEC N2 reduction reaction.
To explore a sustainable system that enables an efficient PEC NRR, chronoamperometry measurements of the as-synthesized g-C3N4, MoSe2, and MoSe2@g-C3N4 hybrids were performed for 2 h at voltages from 0 to −0.5 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte under photo-illumination (Fig. S15–S21†). The current density value tends to increase continuously as the reduction potential increases from 0 to −0.5 V vs. RHE for entire PEC catalysts. The concentration of generated NH3 was quantified spectrophotometrically through the indophenol blue method. After 2 h of PEC NRR, aliquots were collected and stained with the indophenol indicator for collecting UV-vis absorption spectra. Upon addition of indophenol blue assay, the color of the corresponding aliquot (electrolyte) transforms from light yellow to greenish which indicates the presence of NH3 products. The corresponding average NH3 yield and FE values from the chronoamperometric results and UV-vis spectra are revealed in Fig. 6a, b and S15–S22† at several potentials extending from 0 to −0.5 V vs. RHE. It is observed that both the average NH3 yield rate and FE increase over potentials from 0 to −0.3 V vs. RHE, but in a high negative potential window, both the NH3 yield and FE significantly reduce due to the trade-off between high current density and the initiation of a competitive HER over the NRR.

The maximum average NH3 yield rate (7.72 μmol h−1 cm−2) and high FE (28.91%) are observed for the MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) system under ambient conditions (0.1 M KOH solution at −0.3 V vs. RHE), enabling a high-efficiency PEC NRR compared to all other hybrids (Fig. 6b). At higher current density, the NRR is suppressed by the competitive HER on the MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) PEC cathode surface. The PEC NRR performances of g-C3N4, MoSe2, and MoSe2@g-C3N4 (1 wt%, 3 wt%, 5 wt%, 9 wt% and 11 wt%) photocathodes present maximum NH3 yield rates of 2.21, 2.84, 2.89, 3.82, 4.71, 4.92 and 4.18 μmol h−1 cm−2 and FEs of 4.48%, 5.75%, 5.79%, 13.21%, 18.67%, 16.29% and 6.29% respectively, which are lower than those of MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) (Fig. 6b, S15–S21 and Table S2†). In addition, the Watt and Chrisp method was used to determine the hydrazine (N2H4) concentration, in which no apparent N2H4 traces were detected indicating the high selectivity of MoSe2@g-C3N4 hybrids as photoelectrocatalysts towards NH3 synthesis (Fig. S23b†). UV-vis absorption outcomes were used to quantify the NH3 concentration for all obtained electrolytes, and show that no NH3 product was detected for both the pristine carbon paper and Ar gas saturated aliquots, and the corresponding UV-vis absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 6c.
In our opinion, the excellent NH3 yield and FE values of the MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) hybrid can be attributed to the hierarchical micro/nanostructure, which leads to enhanced light-harvesting capability, mass transport and more exposed catalytically active sites. The uniform dispersion of g-C3N4 nanosheets further promotes the formation of heterojunctions between MoSe2 and g-C3N4, which stimulates the synergetic effect and boosts the interfacial surface charge transfer and the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs during the PEC NRR. Additionally, the NH3 yield rate and FE decline gradually as the concentration of g-C3N4 increases from 7 wt% to 11 wt%, owing to agglomeration and surface coating effects (shielding against light illumination) on photo/electrocatalysts that reduce the active surface area for N2 adsorption and desorption for an effective PEC NRR, which are in good match with the SEM images (Fig. 2c–f). It has been reported that the edges of Mo,73 Mo–N, and Se-vacancies, and molybdenum oxide (MoOx), pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen atoms are identified as core catalytically active sites for NH3 synthesis. Cheng et al. also reported a similar result that MoOx coupled Mo2C (MoOx–Mo2C) acts as the active center for the electrocatalytic NRR.67 In this work, a diminutive amount of oxides on the exposed surface of the MoSe2@g-C3N4 hybrid increases the feasibility of MoOx formation, and the coupled MoOx–MoSe2 might act as active sites for an effective NRR, as confirmed by XPS analysis (Fig. 4d).
It is documented that the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) edge potentials of g-C3N4 nanosheets are located at −1.13 and +1.57 eV (ref. 74) respectively, which are more negative than those of MoSe2. Such properties facilitate the movement of an electron from the CB of g-C3N4 to that of MoSe2via heterojunctions (contacting interfaces), which not only impedes the reunion of photoinduced electron–hole pairs but also prolongs the lifetime of the photo-generated electrons to react with the N2 at the surface of hierarchical MoSe2@g-C3N4 catalysts to generate NH3. Therefore, due to the combined effects of electrical current and photo-irradiation, charge transfer occurs from MoSe2 to g-C3N4 nanosheets, which generates positively charged active sites (including Mo edges, Mo–N, and MoOx–MoSe2) and becomes anchoring points that effectively adsorb and polarize the nearby N2 molecules.
Similarly, the H+ species is attracted toward electron-rich g-C3N4 (pyridinic and pyrrolic active sites) through hydrogen bonding.
An associative NRR mechanism that follows the distal pathway quite seems feasible for the PEC NRR on the MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) photo/electrocathode surface without traces of N2H4.35
The excellent PEC NRR performance of the hierarchical MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) hybrid can be ascribed to its active site generation capability and HER suppression ability in 0.1 M KOH solution. The remarkable performance of MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) under ambient conditions is comparable to that of catalyst systems used under harsh conditions (high temperature and pressure) as well as precious metal-based catalysts for the NRR (Tables S2 and S3†).
Apart from the high photoelectrocatalytic activity, good stability is also another important parameter in the selection of efficient electrocatalysts. Herein, the MoSe2@g-C3N4 hybrid photo/electrocatalyst was continuously cycled 10 times in 0.1 M KOH solution for 2 h per cycle (Fig. 6d). During the consecutive 10 cycles at −0.3 V vs. RHE, no obvious variations of NH3 yield and FEs were detected, indicating high stability and sustainability of the hierarchical structured MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) for the PEC NRR to NH3. It is noted that the average NH3 yield and FE of MoSe2@g-C3N4 hybrids in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte (Fig. 6e and Table S2†) are higher than those of numerous state-of-the-art precious metal-free photo/electrocatalysts for N2 fixation (Tables S3 and S4†).
To investigate the actual precursors for NH3 synthesis, photoelectrocatalytic control assays were conducted under two different conditions. Firstly, a working electrode (cathode) of pristine carbon paper (without catalyst) was used in the presence of N2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution at −0.3 V vs. RHE for 2 h. Secondly, the PEC experiment was performed in an Ar-saturated electrolyte using the MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) loaded cathode.
Furthermore, the Ar and 15N2 isotopic labeling experiments were conducted at the optimal voltage of −0.3 V vs. RHE. When the N2 resource is replaced by Ar, after 6 h of photoelectrolysis no 14NH4+ signal is identified in the electrolyte as confirmed through 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra (Fig. 6f). Then, 15N2 was fed to the electrolysis chamber for 6 h and 1H NMR analysis of the obtained electrolyte exhibits a doublet coupling for 15NH4+ and no traces of 14NH4+, which confirm the high stability of N-atoms within the MoSe2@g-C3N4 PEC catalyst (Fig. 6f). Moreover, the 14N2 experiment was also conducted under similar conditions for comparison (Fig. 6f). The multiplet peak splitting can be due to the formation of deuterated ammonium derivatives. These results confirm that NH3 in 0.1 M KOH solution is generated from the N2via the MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) cathode through the PEC NRR process.
3.6 DFT calculations
In order to deeply understand the prospects of N2 activation and active sites of MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) at the molecular level, the adsorption energy of N2 was determined to detect the detailed NH3 production process (Fig. 7a, b). The obtained results indicate that the N2 is promisingly adsorbed and activated at the MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) hybrid surface, where the Mo atom of MoSe2 is the key catalytic active site (Fig. 7a), while g-C3N4 acts as the source of photoexcited electrons for N2 reduction to NH3.53 The idealized model for the MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) heterostructure presents a monoclinic cell structure and lattice parameters (a = 13.883 Å, b = 13.883 Å and c = 30 Å, Fig. S24†). The possible NH3 synthesis route on the surface of the MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) hybrid was speculated by the Gibbs free energy (Fig. 7b). It is shown that the preferred route for NH3 synthesis on the MoSe2@g-C3N4 hybrid is the associative distal route wherein adsorbed N2 is hydrogenated by adsorption of a H+ coupled with electron transfer, leading to the formation of N2H* species at the Mo site. Afterward (H+ + e−) reacts sequentially with the N atom to generate N2H* active species. After adsorption of H+ on the pre-hydrogenated N site in N2H2*, one NH3 molecule can be evolved, leaving other N atoms at the active site of the Mo atom. Thereafter, another three H+ ions coupled with electrons hydrogenate the residual N* species to obtain the second NH3 molecule. The free energy of the primary N2 activation is −4.81 eV that indicates the viable activation of N2 on MoSe2@g-C3N4 hybrid surfaces.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we successfully achieved the NH3 synthesis through a PEC NRR route on hierarchical MoSe2@g-C3N4 photo/electrocathodes under ambient conditions. Hierarchical MoSe2@g-C3N4 hybrids prove to be inherently active, selective and robust photo/electrocatalysts for artificial PEC N2 fixation. MoSe2@g-C3N4 (7 wt%) PEC cathodes particularly elucidate outstanding NRR performance, high NH3 yield rate (7.72 μmol h−1 cm−2) and FE (28.91%) at −0.3 V vs. RHE at room temperature and ambient pressure, due to the synergistic effects and electronic coupling between MoSe2 and g-C3N4. The hierarchical flower-like micro/nanostructures further enhance the light-harvesting capability and charge separation efficiency, which leads to a slow recombination rate and extended lifetime of photoinduced electron–hole pairs that are beneficial to the PEC NRR. Uniform dispersion of exfoliated g-C3N4 nanosheets leads to the formation of heterojunctions that facilely aid the interfacial charge transfer and induce more active sites (such as pyridinic, pyrrolic N atoms) for the NRR. DFT calculations further provide a basic reaction route for the NH3 production process at the surface of MoSe2@g-C3N4. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of MoSe2-based hybrid materials for high-efficiency N2 fixation and thus may open up an alternative route for the rational design of Mo-based PEC catalysts for N2 fixation. In view of excellent FE with high selectivity, it is expected that the earth-abundant MoSe2@g-C3N4 photo/electrocathode provides great opportunities for designing and developing an extremely effective industrial PEC process towards NH3 production from available abundant sources of N2 and H2O at room temperature and pressure.
