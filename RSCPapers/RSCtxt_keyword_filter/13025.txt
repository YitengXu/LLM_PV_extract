    , Accepted 4th September 2020First published on 8th September 2020AbstractWe successfully synthesized a crystalline main chain conjugated copolymer, P(BDBT-co-NDI2T), having BDBT donor-NDI2T acceptor heterojunctions in the film state. Interestingly, the polymer exhibited a strong absorption band from 500 to 650 nm, which overlapped well with the emission spectrum of white light-emitting diodes (LEDs) used as an indoor light source. The P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) films had a relatively smooth surface and internal morphology compared to the blend films of P(BDBT) and P(NDI2T). In particular, the Kelvin probe force microscopy data explained the increased uniformity in the distribution of the surface charge in the annealed P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) films as compared to those of the annealed blend films of P(BDBT) and P(NDI2T). Indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) produced by using the P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) synthesized in this study as an active layer showed a high power conversion efficiency of 12.70% (@500 lux) with a short circuit current density of 49.89 μA cm−2. The PCE of the P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) film-based IPVs was twice as high as that of the blend film-based IPVs and showed excellent operational stability. This study is the first time that the P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) has been applied in IPVs, which suggests the potential for their widespread use in the development of indoor organic PVs in the future.
1. Introduction
The global share of photovoltaic (PV) technologies in the production of electricity and energy for human activities is still insignificant today, due to which high-power consumption devices are still driven by fossil fuels. Until recently, high-efficiency solar cells that are widely used have been developed using inorganic photovoltaic technology.1–3 Nevertheless, organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells based on organic p-type and n-type semiconductors using solar energy have achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 16%, attracting significant interest among many researchers.4,5 OPVs are recognized as an important technology because of their promising advantages such as solution processability, adjustable electronic properties, low-temperature manufacturing process, and lightweight materials.6–11 The development of organic solar cell technology, represented by the “outdoor PV cell,” is focused on maximizing the PCE under AM 1.5G illumination and long-term stability.12–14
Although continuous research has been conducted on the harvesting of solar energy, research on the harvesting of microwatt power output from indoor lighting is limited. Unlike outdoor OPVs, which are primarily manufactured as the flat panel type, indoor photovoltaic (IPV) cells, which can drive low-power electronics, generate PV energy by harvesting photon energy in fluorescent light (FL) or white light-emitting diodes (LEDs) or the surrounding dimly lit environment.15 Microelectronic devices requiring power in the microwatt range can also be driven by IPV technology. With the development of the internet of things (IoT) ecosystem, IPVs have attracted considerable attention due to the proposed range of applications (e.g., wireless sensor networks, actuators, and communications devices) for various indoor energy sources.16 If an active layer is developed to absorb indoor light, generate excitons, and efficiently collect the separated charge carriers at the electrodes, these IPVs will be suitable for micro-energy harvesting applications.17,18 Thus, expanding the diverse range of materials that can be applied in the development of new organic semiconductors for high-performance IPVs is required.19–22
The essential requirement for active materials of IPVs is that their absorption spectrum should overlap with the emission spectrum of LEDs that are often used as indoor lamps.23–25 Since IPVs require high harvesting efficiencies mainly in the visible range, the corresponding active material must be designed and applied differently from the molecular structure of the active material used in outdoor PVs (i.e., solar cells). For this reason, photoactive materials for IPVs must display a narrow absorption spectrum in the visible wavelength range and a medium bandgap.26
All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) are attracting attention due to their applicability in flexible devices, their excellent film-forming properties and their high mechanical stability.27–35 Therefore, although many studies have been conducted and have reported high PCEs over 10%, there are still problems affecting device performance, such as control of miscibility between the donor and acceptor polymers and device stability.36 In order to solve these problems in all-PSCs, research has been conducted on a photoactive material containing an electron donor (D) and acceptor (A) in a single polymer structure.37–39 Our research group has also synthesized main chain conjugated copolymers containing donor–acceptor heterojunctions and applied them in PSCs, i.e., outdoor PVs.40–43
Among them, PBDT2T-b-N2200 was reported to exhibit a high PCE of approximately 6.0% in PSCs.42 Although the polymer showed a broad absorption from 400 to 700 nm, a weak absorption was observed at 600–700 nm, owing to the wide-bandgap donor and low-bandgap acceptor. The copolymer exhibiting strong absorption spectra at 400–600 nm can be applied to IPVs. Many studies have been conducted on outdoor PVs such as organic solar cells and all-PSCs; to date, only one case study has been published in the literature on the IPV properties of the PSC using a donor and acceptor polymer blend active layer.44 Also, studies on IPVs using main chain conjugated copolymers have not been reported in the literature.
In this study, we synthesized a new crystalline main chain conjugated copolymer (i.e. P(BDBT-co-NDI2T)) that includes donor45 and acceptor based polydisperse macromolecular species. The copolymer showed a strong absorption band in the range of 450–650 nm, overlapping well with the emission spectrum of a white LED (indoor light source). Unlike the active layer which was previously prepared by optimizing the composition of two substances and mixing them, an active layer using only the copolymer was prepared to implement outdoor and indoor PV devices. As a result, the P(BDBT-co-NDI2T)-based IPV devices with an annealed active layer exhibited a maximum PCE of 12.70% with a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 49.89 μA cm−2 and an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.71 V. In comparison, the P(BDBT-co-NDI2T)-based PSC device as an outdoor PV device exhibited a relatively lower PCE of 6.22% (under AM 1.5G irradiation). The developed active material in this study can be implemented as a small power generation device with twice the efficiency in IPV devices. Therefore, the results of this IPV research using an active layer made only of P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) will be a cornerstone for future research in this area.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Polymer synthesis and characterization
P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) was synthesized using a simple synthesis method reported in our previous studies.42,43 The synthetic route and expected structure of P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) are illustrated in Scheme S1.† During the Soxhlet extraction of the crude product obtained after synthesis of P(BDBT-co-NDI2T), relatively low molecular weight polymers and residual catalysts could be removed. In particular, P(NDI2T), which was first synthesized as a base polymer, shows excellent solubility in methylene chloride (MC), so most of the unreacted substances were removed during this extraction process.
Then, the final product, P(BDBT-co-NDI2T), was obtained from the chloroform (CF) fraction. P(NDI2T) bearing longer alkyl side chains (i.e., decyltetradecyl group) than N2200 showed good solubility in MC, THF, and chlorinated aromatic solvents, while P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) exhibited limited solubility in CF and is not soluble in hot MC. It is thought that a trace amount of P(BDBT) may remain in the synthesized copolymer. The number average molecular weights (Mn) of the synthesized polymers were measured using gel permeation chromatography (GPC); the results are shown in Table S1.† The Mn values of the intermediate NDI2T-based polymer (P(NDI2T)) and the final P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) were, respectively, 39.8, and 42.2 kg mol−1 and the corresponding values of the polydispersity (PDI) were 2.34 and 3.59.
We verified the chemical structure of P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) and attempted to determine the composition of the donor and acceptor repeating groups by performing 1H NMR (Fig. S1†) and repeated elemental analyses (EA). Finally, since the nitrogen element only exists in P(NDI2T), the molar ratio of the repeating units of P(BDBT) and P(NDI2T) was determined using the nitrogen content in P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) obtained from elemental analyses. As a result, the molar ratio of the P(BDBT) and P(NDI2T) repeating units was approximately 2:1.
2.2. Optical, electrochemical, and thermal properties of P(BDBT), P(NDI2T), and P(BDBT-co-NDI2T)
The absorption spectra of the synthesized P(BDBT), P(NDI2T), and P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) in chloroform and thin films are shown in Fig. 1, and the corresponding data are outlined in Table 1. The synthesized P(BDBT) and P(NDI2T) showed absorption similar to that previously reported; P(BDBT) showed an absorption peak at approximately 620 nm, and P(NDI2T) showed absorption peaks at approximately 380 nm and 700 nm.45,46 The absorption spectrum of the P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) copolymer solution showed two absorption bands at 364 and 614 nm with similar absorption features to those of the mixture of P(BDBT) and P(NDI2T). In the film state, P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) showed two peaks at 367 and 617 nm, including a shoulder at approximately 700 nm. The optical bandgaps (Egs) of P(BDBT) and P(NDI2T) using the cut-off wavelength of the absorption spectrum in the thin film state were determined to be 1.79 and 1.47 eV, respectively. And we show the absorption spectra of the P(BDBT):P(NDI2T) (2:1) blend solution and film in Fig. S2.† These spectra are similar in shape to those of the copolymer, but shows a difference in the spectral shape in the 550–650 nm wavelength range, possibly due to the difference in molecular weight between P(BDBT) and the donor unit in the copolymer. The electrochemical behaviors of P(BDBT), P(NDI2T) and P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) films were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV). As shown in Fig. S3,† the first oxidation potentials of P(BDBT) and P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) were +0.82 and +0.89 V, respectively.

The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were calculated using the oxidation/reduction potentials of P(BDBT), P(NDI2T), and P(BDBT-co-NDI2T). As a result, the HOMO and LUMO of the film state were determined to be −5.25/−3.66 eV, −5.86/−3.88 eV, and −5.32/−3.95 eV for P(BDBT), P(NDI2T), and P(BDBT-co-NDI2T), respectively (Fig. 1d).
The thermal properties of the polymers P(BDBT), P(NDI2T), and P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) were investigated with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements. The TGA measurements revealed that the polymers were stable, showing a decomposition temperature (Td) of 426, 453, and 405 °C for P(BDBT), P(NDI2T) and P(BDBT-co-NDI2T), respectively (Fig. S4†). In Fig. S5,† the DSC curves of P(NDI2T) exhibited a well resolved thermal transition with an endothermic peak (Tm) at 298 °C during heating and an exothermic peak (Tc) at 272 °C during cooling. A similar thermal transition behavior was also seen for the blend and P(BDBT-co-NDI2T). However, the DSC curve of P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) was not fully characterized over the entire measured temperature range, which is likely due to low crystallinity. In the thermogram of the blend film, the heat flow at the transition temperature mentioned above tended to be very reduced, and it was interpreted that the crystallization behavior of P(NDI2T) was hindered in the blend. Specifically, it is expected that P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) also exhibits a transition behavior similar to that of the blend film, and thus has low crystallinity. Therefore, we conducted an X-ray diffraction experiment to further explore the crystallinity of the polymers and the results will be discussed later (Fig. S20†).
2.3. Performance of polymer solar cell: outdoor PVs under AM 1.5G illumination
Before studying the indoor PV properties, we first investigated the photovoltaic performance of inverted-type PSCs with a configuration of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag, using a P(BDBT):P(NDI2T) blend film and a P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) film as the active layers. The active materials of the PSC were all processed using a chlorobenzene (CB) solution without any solvent additives. To optimize the annealing effect, various annealing temperatures were adopted, and device performance according to different D/A weight ratios for the blend films was also investigated. The results are shown in Fig. S6, S7 and Tables S2, S3.†
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the outdoor-type PSCs characterized under the illumination of AM 1.5G simulated solar light at 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 2, and the PV parameters are outlined in Table 2. As shown in Table 2, the annealed P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) film exhibited a PCEmax of 6.22% with a Jsc of 10.76 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.89 V, and an FF of 0.65. The Jsc and FF were higher than those of the as-cast P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) film (5.07% with Jsc = 9.50 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.89 V, and FF = 0.60).

All-PSCs made of the as-cast and annealed blend films displayed a low PCE of 2.74–4.09% due to the lower Jsc values. The significant difference in Jsc between P(BDBT-co-NDI2T)- and binary blend film-based PSC devices was verified through the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra. As shown in Fig. 2b, the P(BDBT-co-NDI2T)-based PSC device exhibited a relatively high EQE value within the range of 500–700 nm (50% at 550 nm and 60% at 600 nm). The integrated Jsc values from the EQE spectrum were 8.02 and 10.37 mA cm−2 for the devices made with the P(BDBT):P(NDI2T) blend (2:1) and annealed P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) films, respectively.
These values are well consistent with the values obtained from the J–V curves, supporting a high Jsc and PCE with the enhancement of light-harvesting. Based on the formula Eloss = Eg,EQE − eVoc, where Eg,EQE is the minimum bandgap among components in the active layer and Eloss is the energy loss, we note that the P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) film-based device has an Eloss of 0.63 eV, which is much lower than that for the blend film-based device (Eloss = 0.69–0.71 eV).47,48
To better understand the superior performance of the P(BDBT-co-NDI2T)-based PSC device, the exciton generation, exciton dissociation, charge recombination, and series/shunt resistance were investigated and are discussed in the ESI (Fig. S9–S11†).
2.4. Performance of the polymer solar cell: indoor PVs under a white LED
The P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) film was observed to show strong absorption bands from 450 to 650 nm, which are well-overlapped with the emission spectrum of a white LED lamp (Fig. S12†). From this result, the possibility of P(BDBT-co-NDI2T)-based IPV cells operating under LED lighting was investigated in detail. With an LED light with a luminance of 500 lux (Pin = 170 μW cm−2), the device with the annealed P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) film exhibited a maximum PCE of 12.70% with a Voc of 0.71 V, Jsc of 49.89 μA cm−2, and FF of 0.61 from an output power density (Pout) of 21.59 μW cm−2, as shown in Fig. 3. Compared with the Voc value under AM 1.5G illumination, under the indoor lighting of LEDs, this is low, which is due to the very low density of photogenerated charge carriers under the low intensity of the incident light.25 In this case, as shown in Table 3, at 200 lux (Pin = 68 μW cm−2) and 1000 lux (Pin = 340 μW cm−2), the PCEs of the device made with the annealed P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) film were 11.19 and 12.61%, indicating the reliability of the measured data. The PCE of P(BDBT-co-NDI2T)-based IPVs was observed to be almost twice as high as that of the P(BDBT-co-NDI2T)-based PSC. However, the IPVs based on the blend film had poor device performance as displayed in Fig. 3a. The Voc and Jsc of the IPV devices continued to increase as the light intensity changed from 200 lux to 1000 lux because the number of charge carriers collected at the two electrodes of the PV device increased as the intensity of incident light increased. As shown in Fig. 3c, the two devices show a similar slope of 1.30 kT/q for the P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) films and 1.43 kT/q for the P(BDBT):P(NDI2T) blend films. It is known that trap-assisted recombination is dominant when Voc is highly dependent on the light intensity with slopes over 2 kT/q.49–51 This is consistent with the small series resistance (Table S5†). The result demonstrates that bimolecular recombination is the dominant mechanism in these devices, rather than trap-assisted recombination.

In IPVs, the PV parameters (e.g., Jsc and FF) are greatly affected by the resistance in the device. In particular, the shunt resistance is a particularly important variable because the current value flowing in the device is very small. The series resistance (RS) and shunt resistance (RSH) values for the IPV devices are displayed in Fig. 3d. IPVs with an annealed active layer clearly show a decreasing trend for RS and an increasing one for RSH. Steim et al. showed that RSH is more critical than RS to the performance under low intensity incident light and suggested that a minimum RSH of 85 kΩ cm2 is required for low light level applications.52 In particular, the FF value of the IPVs with the annealed P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) film was significantly affected by both RS (2.73 kΩ cm2) and RSH (120 kΩ cm2). As a result, higher FF values induced improved device performance. The device with the as-cast P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) film exhibited an FF of about 0.60, and the device using the film annealed at 120 °C for 10 minutes showed an FF of 0.61. Therefore, the current loss of the IPVs fabricated with the annealed active layer was found to be reduced, which means that a higher degree of crystallization in the film state can prevent current leakage from the boundary between the active layer and the electrode, compared with the blend film.
As with the outdoor PVs, the exciton generation, exciton separation, and charge extraction characteristics in the IPVs were investigated through an analysis of the dependence of Jph on the Veff of the devices (Fig. S15a†). Under short circuit conditions, the annealed P(BDBT-co-NDI2T)-based device showed a higher Pdiss of 97.6%, which is consistent with the higher Jsc. These results indicate that the charge recombination loss is much less under the maximum power output conditions for the P(BDBT-co-NDI2T)-based IPVs, which partially contributes to a markedly improved FF.
2.5. Charge transport properties in the blend and P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) films
To study the charge transport behavior in the PV cells, we explored the hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities using hole-only and electron-only devices using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method.53 The recorded J–V characteristics are shown in Fig. S16.†
After thermal annealing, the blend and P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) films generally displayed higher carrier mobility and improved charge balance compared to the as-cast film (Table S6†). As a result, the annealed P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) film exhibited the highest carrier mobility (i.e., μh of 5.33 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe of 4.87 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1) and charge balance (μh/μe = 1.09), which is ascribed to the larger interfacial boundaries between the donor and acceptor domains and the formation of well-defined charge transport channels. The balanced hole and electron mobilities are related to RS and the extent of bimolecular recombination. The same trend as in the previous experiments showed the lowest RS and charge recombination in the annealed P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) film, in addition to the most improved hole and electron mobility ratio. Therefore, the highly balanced charge mobility in the annealed P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) film may be an essential factor in improving the Jsc and FF values observed in the corresponding PV cell.
2.6. Morphological characteristics of the blend and P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) films
We performed atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), and grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray diffraction (GIWAXD) to explore the effect of the film morphology and the crystalline properties of the active layer on the device performance.
According to the AFM images, the root-mean-square roughness (Rq) values of the P(BDBT):P(NDI2T) blend and P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) film decreased, respectively, from 1.77 to 1.60 and from 0.66 to 0.54 nm after thermal annealing (Fig. 4 and S16†). As expected, the blend film showed a distinct micro-phase separation morphology with a fibrous structure due to the crystallization of the domains of each donor P(BDBT) or acceptor polymer P(NDI2T) (Fig. 4a and b). After thermal annealing, no significant changes in surface morphology could be observed. On the other hand, the AFM images of the P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) films showed a relatively smooth surface and good miscibility after thermal annealing. Significant micro-phase separation behavior was not observed in Fig. 4d and e.

The TEM image of the blend film also clearly showed the internal morphology of the thick, fibrous texture over the entire film surface. In Fig. 4f, the internal morphology of the P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) film was filled with much more uniform and nano-sized discrete crystallites. This structure is beneficial for effective exciton generation, diffusion, dissociation, and charge carrier transport when driving a PV device.54 Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) is a useful tool for determining the potential on the active layer before evaluating the performance of the organic solar cells.55–57
It allows access to information on surface topography, such as surface charge distribution, that is inaccessible by conventional AFM by measuring the contact potential difference (CPD) between the tip and substrate. In particular, a comparison of CPD maps measured in the dark and under light irradiation offers the unique opportunity to assess the degree of homogeneity in light-induced charge separation across a finite surface. This experiment does not give absolute values of the efficiency of light absorption and energy conversion. Rather, it provides relative surface potential variations, which are essential for drawing meaningful inferences on how organizational features of the polymer film are related to the device performance, with reliability.
A comprehensive KPFM study was carried out on the four active layers in PSCs: (i) P(BDBT), (ii) P(NDI2T), (iii) P(BDBT):P(NDI2T) blend (2:1) and (iv) P(BDBT-co-NDI2T). We conducted KPFM measurements in the dark and under CW laser illumination at 532 nm (green) under ambient conditions and generated CPD histograms (Fig. 5 and S18†) from which the mean (μCPD) and standard deviation (σCPD) were estimated. In the instrument setup, VAC was applied to a sample while grounding the tip. The results are outlined in Table 4 and S7.†

We identified the following five features of the surface energetics. (i) The CPD dispersion of the P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) film exhibited a narrow single Gaussian distribution under both dark and light irradiation conditions. In contrast, the other polymers (e.g., P(BDBT), P(NDI2T), and their blend) showed multimodal, broad CPD dispersions, indicating the remarkable homogeneity of the surface charge distribution in the P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) film, compared to the others. (ii) Upon light irradiation, values of μCPD for the blend and P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) films were further shifted toward negative values, indicating the occurrence of light absorption and the generation of electron-rich surfaces via charge separation. (iii) The P(BDBT)-only polymer film, however, exhibited a shift of the μCPD value toward positive values (ΔμCPD = +9.0 meV), suggesting that the light-induced charge separation yielded hole-rich surfaces. (iv) For the P(NDI2T)-only polymer film, the value of μCPD did not significantly vary upon irradiation, which was attributed to the low absorption coefficient for green laser light (Fig. 1). (v) Interestingly, P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) exhibited the most considerable shift of μCPD:ΔμCPD of −67.0 meV, which differed by orders of magnitude from those of the other polymers. This finding suggests that qualitatively the most efficient charge separation occurred in the P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) film, revealing that it exhibits a uniform surface morphology.
The most important feature among our observations is that the P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) film exhibited the most striking response to light without losing the narrow, homogeneous distribution of the surface charge. Exciton separation in a polymeric system depends on the efficiency for P(BDBT) and P(NDI2T) to generate excitons, the degree of phase segregation between P(BDBT) and P(NDI2T), and percolation of phases. Given that we used identical constituents in the tested polymer films, the latter two factors should account for the results of our KPFM experiments. Our findings can be condensed to the conclusion that covalently connecting donor and acceptor macromolecular units to yield a copolymeric system remarkably enhances the homogeneity of the surface charge distribution and the performance of light-induced charge separation, which accounts for the high efficiency of energy conversion in P(BDBT-co-NDI2T).
We also performed a GIWAXD experiment to compare the crystallinity of the blend film and P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) film. The GIWAXD patterns confirmed that the blend film exhibited a similar diffraction behavior to the P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) film with annealing temperature, with a weak (010) diffraction peak in the out-of-plane direction and an (n00) peak in the in-plane direction (Fig. S20†). The P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) film showed a (010) peak at qz = 1.65 Å−1, which was assigned to the π–π stacking distance. Two (200) peaks originated from the BDBT at qxy = 0.63 Å−1 and NDI2T qxy = 0.45 Å−1 (Table S9†). This suggests that the donor and acceptor based macromolecular species have a predominant face-on orientation in the P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) film. In the P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) film, as verified through the diffraction peaks of P(BDBT) and P(NDI2T), the donor and acceptor clusters exhibited a double crystallization behavior. The face-on crystalline orientation of the polymer chains and their aggregates identified in the diffraction profile of the P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) film facilitates exciton dissociation and efficient hole/electron generation within the active layer of the corresponding PV, which can greatly influence the transport of charge carriers.
2.7. Operational stability of P(BDBT-co-NDI2T)-based IPVs
We investigated the effect of the stability of four IPVs operating over 110 min under atmospheric conditions without encapsulation. The dependence of PCE on light illumination time under LED lighting (@500 lux) is displayed in Fig. 6 and S21.† After 110 minutes of light irradiation, the PCE of the P(BDBT-co-NDI2T)-based IPVs showed almost negligible reduction (∼1%), whereas, with the P(BDBT):P(NDI2T) blend film-based IPVs, it was reduced to 85% of the initial PCE (Fig. 6). In the emission spectrum of the low light intensity LED lamp, since UV light that causes photodegradation of conjugated organic materials is not emitted, it can be estimated that this reduction in efficiency is mainly due to the intrinsic blend morphology.58,59

Further investigations are needed to determine the exact cause of this phenomenon. The relatively stable device performance may be related to the active layer structure of the P(BDBT-co-NDI2T), and the function of these active layers provides an important clue for avenues leading to improved device stability in future IPV studies.
3. Conclusions
In this work, we demonstrated a novel conjugated copolymer, P(BDBT-co-NDI2T), having donor–acceptor heterojunctions for achieving indoor PVs. The IPV cell with the P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) active layer exhibited high absorption in the LED emission wavelength range due to the medium bandgap (Eg = 1.93 eV) and the adequate energy level alignment of the P(BDBT-co-NDI2T). In terms of IPV performance, Jsc and Voc were measured to be 49.89 μA cm−2 and 0.71 V, resulting in a high power conversion efficiency of 12.70%, which is almost two times higher than that of IPVs with the blend film and measured in outdoor PVs, i.e. PSCs. This result was thought to be due to a smoother surface/internal morphology of the P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) films. Additionally, KPFM data also indicated a relatively uniform distribution of the surface charge in the P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) annealed films. These results may explain why P(BDBT-co-NDI2T)-based devices exhibit higher efficiency. Moreover, the P(BDBT-co-NDI2T)-based IPV device showed very high operational stability compared to the blend film-based device. This is the first time that P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) has been applied in IPVs, suggesting the possibility of being widely used for IPV development in the future.
