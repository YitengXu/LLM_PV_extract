    , Accepted 12th May 2021First published on 18th May 2021AbstractA series of dyes with the D–π–A architecture has been designed and studied for dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). We have used phenothiazine (PTZ) and coumarin (COU) derivatives as the donor unit and benzopyrrole (BTZ) and 2-methyl-2H-isoindole-1,3-(3aH,7aH)-diene (IND) as the acceptor unit along with the azomethine group and thiophene ring as the π-spacer unit. Three electron donating groups viz. –CH3, –NH2, and –OH and four electron withdrawing groups viz. –CF3, –COCl, –F and –NO2 have been attached at the donor and the acceptor units respectively of the four unsubstituted dyes COU–BTZ, PTZ–BTZ, COU–IND and PTZ–IND. Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) methods have been employed to investigate the structural, electronic and photochemical properties of these dyes. The study reveals that the unsubstituted dye PTZ–BTZ possesses the lowest value of ΔH–L. Our study also reveals that attachment of the –NO2 group at the acceptor unit lowers the ΔH–L values of all the dye molecules. We have observed that the excited state oxidation potential (ESOP) of all the dyes lies above the conduction band of the TiO2 semiconducting surface. However, the ground state oxidation potential (GSOP) of most of the dyes belonging to the COU–BTZ and COU–IND groups lies below the redox potential of the I−/I3− redox couple. The total reorganization energy (λtot) values of the COU–BTZ and COU–IND groups of dyes are observed to be low compared to the other groups of dyes. The study of the charge transport properties of the dyes confirms that the designed dyes will act as electron transport materials. The absorption properties of the dyes show that the COU–BTZ group of dyes possesses the maximum values of the absorption wavelength (λmax values) and attaching the –NO2 group at the acceptor unit shifts the λmax values of all the dyes to the longer region. From the study of the electronic properties of the dye–TiO2 complexes it has been observed that the performance of the dyes has been enhanced compared to the isolated dye molecules.
1 Introduction
Since the last century, the world has been facing a huge energy crisis and as a result serious environmental issues have been raised.1 Extensive research has been going on in the field of clean and green renewable resources as an alternative source of energy.2–5 Silicon based first generation solar cells are getting attraction day by day as they have the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE). But, compared to the organic counterparts silicon based inorganic solar cells possess some limitations like their high cost, difficulties in the manufacturing process, less mechanical flexibility, etc.5,6 Cadmium telluride (CdTe) and copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) based second generation solar cells have low cost of production and are efficient for the mentioned purpose, but due to their toxicity and unavailability their production has been shut down. In this regard, the third generation solar cells, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), also known as Gratzel cells, have been attaining enormous attention.1 Academic and commercial interest has been focused on DSSCs due to their low cost of production, simple assembly technology and ease of fabrication, and wide availability of the materials, which are environment friendly.1,2,4,7–20
Wide and extensive research has been performed on DSSCs since Gratzel and co-workers reported a DSSC based on Ru-complex photosensitizers in 1991.21–26 Reportedly, a DSSC based on a ruthenium (Ru–polypyridyl) complex has a PCE up to 11%.8,12,18,25–31 It has also been reported that organic dyes in DSSCs exhibit a PCE over 12%.32–35 However, the higher cost of Ru metal and lower extinction coefficient (usually <2.50 × 104 M−1 cm−1 in the visible region) have limited the development of Ru based dyes.1,2,22 Therefore, the study of metal free sensitizers i.e., organic sensitizers for application in DSSCs has become a rising topic these days. However, certain factors have been proven to be disadvantageous for organic dyes as well, such as their relatively sharp and narrow absorption bands in the visible region, which are not suitable for harvesting solar energy.5,27 Secondly, the lifetimes of emission of their excited states are generally shorter than those of metal complexes (e.g., 0.4–5 ns).5,21,25 Thirdly, organic dyes are reportedly found to aggregate on the semiconductor surface.25,36 In spite of these difficulties, much improvement has been made on metal-free organic dye based DSSCs by several groups.
Organic dye sensitized solar cells consist of a donor–acceptor (D–A) moiety where a π conjugated spacer covalently links the donor and the acceptor thereby allowing charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor through the π bridge.2 The dye is held on the semiconducting surface (TiO2, SiO2, etc.) by anchoring groups like cyanoacrylic acid groups or carboxylic acid groups.37 A DSSC includes a counter conducting electrode, a photoanode and an electrolyte (usually a redox iodide/triiodide couple (I−/I3−)).23 In DSSCs the electron injection and the electron regeneration processes are two important steps. In these cells, the conduction band of the TiO2 semiconducting surface lies at −4.00 eV and the chemical potential of the I−/I3− couple lies at −4.80 eV.38,39 The electron injection and the electron regeneration processes are possible only when the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the sensitizer lies below the chemical potential of the redox couple and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the sensitizer lies above the conduction band of the semiconductor.
In the D–π–A architecture of DSSCs, the most commonly used donors are triphenylamine, indoline, coumarin, bis-dimethylfluorenylamino, phenothiazine, etc. Commonly used π spacers are methane chains, thiophene, furan, pyrrole, benzene, etc.1 The aromatic ring π spacer segment lessens the reorganization energy, facilitate effective electron transfer and maintains the planarity of the skeleton, which reduces steric congestion, allowing more compact dye packing on the semiconducting surface.40 Electron withdrawing groups like cyanoacrylic acid and carboxylic acid groups act as good anchoring groups which are bonded covalently to the semiconductor. The carboxylic acid can bind to the semiconducting surface via a unidentate mode, chelating mode, and bridging bidentate mode.37,41
The photophysical properties of DSSCs can be tuned by allowing a shift in the HOMO and LUMO.2 The shift can be brought about by extending the π-conjugation or by adding various substituents (electron donating and electron withdrawing groups) in the donor and acceptor. This kind of molecular engineering can bring about a red shift in the absorption spectra of organic dyes, thereby increasing the charge transfer efficiency.2 In this paper, we have chosen four parent donor–acceptor (D–A) complexes with a common π-spacer. We have used phenothiazine (PTZ) and coumarin (COU) derivatives as the donor unit and benzopyrrole (BTZ) and 2-methyl-2H-isoindole-1,3-(3aH,7aH)-diene (IND) as the acceptor unit.21 The thiophene ring along with the azomethine unit is chosen as the π-linker, while the anchoring group cyanoacrylic acid is functionalized over the semiconductor surface.6 Here, we have used TiO2 as the semiconductor surface. The four D–A moieties selected are COU–BTZ, PTZ–BTZ, COU–IND and PTZ–IND. In order to tune the performance of DSSCs, three different electron donating groups viz. –CH3, –NH2, and –OH and four different electron withdrawing groups viz. –CF3, –COCl, –F and –NO2 have been incorporated into the donor and acceptor moieties, respectively. The compounds having substituents –CH3, –NH2, –OH, –CF3, –COCl, –F, and –NO2 are represented by the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4′, 5′, 6′ and 7′, respectively. Sketches of the studied compounds have been provided in Fig. 1. The coordinates of the studied compounds have been provided in Table S1 (in the ESI†).

We have calculated the values of the dihedral angle, ground state dipole moment (μg), excited state dipole moment (μe), energies of the HOMO and LUMO, energy difference between these two levels (ΔH–L values), ionization potential (IP), electron affinity (EA), ground state oxidation potential (GSOP), excited state oxidation potential (ESOP), light harvesting capacity (LHC), open circuit voltage (Voc), reorganization energy (λ), charge transfer rates (kct), etc. The absorption properties of the dyes have also been studied. We have used the (TiO2)5 cluster as the semiconducting surface to study the more realistic performance of the solar cells.
2 Computational methodology
All the calculations have been carried out using the Gaussian 09 program package.42 The ground-state geometries of all the dyes have been optimized by employing the density functional theory (DFT) method. The optimized structures have been confirmed to be at the minimum-energy points by vibrational analysis. To validate the functionals used in our calculations we have performed test calculations with the dye DIA3 reported in the literature as it has structural similarity with our designed compounds.43,44 The test calculations have been performed using the DFT method with the functionals B3LYP, B3LYP-D3, CAM-B3LYP, M06-2X-D3, PBEPBE, and ωB97XD and the 6-31G(d,p) basis set. The optimized structure of the test compound has been presented in Fig. S1 (ESI†) and the calculated results have been reported in Table S2 (in the ESI†). From this table, it is observed that for the ground state calculations the results obtained using the functionals B3LYP and B3LYP-D3 are in better agreement with the experimentally reported values. On the other hand, for the excited state calculations the results obtained using the functionals CAM-B3LYP and ωB97XD are in better agreement with the experimentally reported values. However, to keep the computational cost under control we have performed the ground state and excited state calculations employing the functionals B3LYP and CAM-B3LYP, respectively. The plot of the UV-visible spectra of the test compound has been presented in Fig. S2 (in the ESI†).
For the solvent phase calculations we have employed the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM) where tetrahydrofuran (THF) is chosen as a solvent.45 The charge state optimization, energy calculation of the neutral and charged state, and ionization potential (IP), electron affinity (EA), and reorganization energy (λ) calculations have been carried out at the B3LYP-D3/6-31G(d,p) level of theory. For the calculation of electronic coupling matrix element (V) values the M06-2X-D3/6-31G(d,p) level has been employed because this functional includes dispersion correction and is considered suitable for the study of charge transfer properties.46
For the optimization of the dye–TiO2 complexes the split valence method has been used. The B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory has been employed for the atoms other than the Ti atom and for the Ti atom the B3LYP functional along with the LANL2DZ basis set has been employed.47
3 Theoretical details
Herein, we have used the adiabatic approach to calculate the values of the IP and EA. The IP and EA values have been calculated using eqn (1) and (2), respectively:6 IP = E+ − E0,(1) EA = E0 − E−,(2)where E0, E+ and E− represent the energies of the neutral, cationic and anionic states of the molecules, respectively.23
The reorganization energy (λ) values are usually contributed by the inner sphere and the outer sphere parts. The outer sphere part arises from either the relaxation of the nucleus/electrons or polarization of the surrounding medium. On the other hand, the inner sphere part arises from the geometry relaxation process whenever a charge is released or accepted by the molecule.6,48 We have taken into account only the inner sphere contribution.
The values of the reorganization energy for holes (λh) and electrons (λe) are calculated using eqn (3) and (4), respectively:48–56 λh = [E+(M°) − E+(M+)] + [E°(M+) − E°(M°)],(3) λe = [E°(M−) − E°(M°)] + [E−(M°) − E−(M−)],(4)where M°, M+ and M− are the neutral, cationic and anionic geometries of the molecules, respectively.
The total reorganization energy (λtot) can be calculated by using eqn (5):23 λtot = λh + λe.(5)
The values of the charge transfer rates (kct) between two adjacent molecules can be calculated using Marcus theory. The relevant expression for kct when there is no barrier can be given by eqn (6):48–50,53,55–59 (6)where T is the temperature on the absolute scale, V is the electronic coupling matrix element between the two species, kB is the Boltzmann constant and ħ is the reduced Planck constant.
The values of the electronic coupling matrix element for holes (V+) and for electrons (V−) between two adjacent species (also called the charge transfer integral) are calculated by using eqn (7):48,57,59,60 (7)where EH, EH−1, EL, and EL+1 are the energies of the HOMO, HOMO−1, LUMO and LUMO+1 orbitals, respectively, of the closed-shell configuration of the neutral state of the molecules. A larger value of V represents efficient charge transfer, which depends on the orbital overlap between the two species.
The energy conversion efficiency (η) of a photovoltaic device is generally expressed using eqn (8):1,20,23,37,61 (8)where Jsc, Voc, Pin and FF represent the short-circuit photocurrent density, open-circuit voltage, input power of incident sunlight and fill factor, respectively.

J
sc can be defined as:23 (9)where ϕinject and ηcollect are the measure of electron injection and electron collection, respectively. LHC is the light harvesting capacity, which is defined as:23 LHC = 1 − 10−fosc,(10)where fosc is the oscillation strength corresponding to the wavelength of the absorption maximum.
The open-circuit voltage, Voc, is defined as:23 Voc = ELUMO − ECB,(11)where ELUMO and ECB are the energies of the LUMO and conduction band of the semiconductor, respectively.
The ground state oxidation potential (GSOP) and excited state oxidation potential (ESOP) can be calculated using eqn (12) and (13):23 GSOP = E0(sol) − E+(sol),(12) ESOP = GSOP + Eg,(13)where E0(sol) and E+(sol) represent the ground state energies of the neutral and cation configuration in solution, respectively, and Eg represents the first excitation energy.
The thermodynamic driving force (ΔGinj) for the transfer of excited electrons from the oxidized dye to the CB of the semiconductor is directly related to the excited state oxidation potential (ESOP). The required equation for ΔGinj is given below:23 ΔGinj = ESOP − ECB.(14)
Several studies reported that the photovoltaic performance of a DSSC greatly depends on the driving force of regeneration (ΔGreg) of the dye. Dye regeneration is a process where the oxidized dye after electron injection is regenerated by the redox electrolyte. ΔGreg can be calculated by using eqn (15):23 ΔGreg = Eredox(I−/I3−) − GSOP(15)
4 Results and discussion
4.1 Geometric structure, frontier molecular orbitals and oxidation potentials of the dyes
We have optimized the designed dyes accompanied by frequency calculations. From the vibrational frequency analysis we have observed that the obtained frequencies are positive for all the dyes. No imaginary or negative frequency is observed for any of the optimized structures. This in turn confirms the stability of our designed dyes.
The dihedral angle is one of the most prominent parameters affecting the planarity of molecules.56,57 A representation of the dihedral angle in a compound is provided in Fig. 2. The calculated values of the dihedral angles of the studied compounds have been reported in Table 1. From Table 1 it is observed that among the unsubstituted dye molecules the dihedral angle between the donor and π-unit (D–π) possesses the minimum and maximum values for the COU–BTZ and PTZ–IND groups of dyes, respectively. Moreover, low dihedral angle values are observed between the π-unit and the acceptor unit (π–A) for the COU–BTZ and PTZ–BTZ groups of dyes compared to the other dye systems. We have also observed that the dihedral angle values between the anchoring group and the acceptor unit for all the studied compounds are higher for the –CF3, –COCl and –NO2 substituted compounds.

From Table 1 it is observed that the nature and the position of the substituents significantly affect the dihedral angles of the compounds. It is observed that electron donating groups do not affect the dihedral angle values to a large extent but electron withdrawing groups increase the dihedral angle of the compounds for most of the compounds. Among the electron withdrawing groups, the –CF3 group increases the dihedral angle between the π-unit and the acceptor unit to the maximum extent for all of the compounds. This suggests that bulky substituents affect the planarity of the compounds.
In order to study the electron transfer process in the D–A system one has to understand the electronic distribution of the molecular structure. The calculated energy values of the HOMO and LUMO and ΔH–L values of the dyes have been reported in Table 2. From this table it is observed that, among the four unsubstituted dyes COU–BTZ, PTZ–BTZ, COU–IND and PTZ–IND, PTZ–BTZ possesses the lowest and COU–IND possesses the highest value of ΔH–L. This is because of the stabilization of the LUMO energy levels of these compounds to the maximum and minimum extent, respectively.

From Table 2 it is also observed that attachment of the –NO2 group at the acceptor unit lowers the ΔH–L values of all the four dye systems. This result can be explained by the fact that the –NO2 substituent stabilizes the LUMO energy level of the compounds. Moreover, attachment of the –NO2 group at the acceptor unit increases the extent of conjugation of the molecular backbone and thus decreases the ΔH–L values. Conversely, attachment of the –NH2 group at the donor unit lowers the ΔH–L values of all the dye systems except for COU–IND. This is because the –NH2 substituent destabilize the HOMO energy levels of the compounds and also increases the extent of conjugation of the molecule. This phenomenon reduces the ΔH–L values of the compounds. This fact is supported by the frontier molecular orbital diagram of the above compounds provided in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  Plot of the frontier molecular orbitals of the –NH2 and –NO2 substituted dyes. 
The electron density distribution pattern in the frontier molecular orbitals of the compounds provides a clear understanding of the relation between the energy levels and the structure of the molecules. The plots of the frontier molecular orbitals of the unsubstituted dyes have been provided in Fig. 4. From this figure it is observed that the HOMOs are delocalized over the donor part and extended to the π-bridging unit. On the other hand the LUMOs are delocalized over the acceptor parts and extended to the anchoring group. The overlapping of the MOs of the dyes reveals the occurrence of an effective charge transfer process in the dyes.
 Fig. 4  Plot of the frontier molecular orbitals of the unsubstituted dyes. 
We have also calculated the values of the ground state dipole moment (μg) and excited state dipole moment (μe) of the compounds and the values have been reported in Table 1. From this table it is observed that the μe values are higher than the μg values for all the compounds. This indicates that the excited states are more polar than the ground state. It is also observed that the COU–BTZ group of dyes possesses the highest and the PTZ–IND group of dyes possesses the lowest values of both μg and μe.
To examine the charge-transfer properties of the dyes, we have calculated the values of the ionization potential (IP) and electron affinity (EA) of the dyes, which affect the electron injection and hole generation process. The IP can be defined as the energy required to remove an electron from the neutral species of a molecule. Thus, a low IP value ensures easy removal of an electron, which in turn creates a hole easily. The EA can be defined as the difference between the energies of the neutral and anion species of a molecule in their lowest energy states.6,23,45 Thus, it is similar to the binding energy of an electron to the molecule. It has already been reported that the EA of the dye molecule allows a desensitizing process or causes recombination between the injected electrons and the oxidized dye species. If the EA value is high the removal of the conduction band electrons will be very difficult. Therefore, to transfer electrons efficiently to the semiconducting surface a small EA value is desirable for a dye sensitizer.23
The calculated values of the IP and EA have been reported in Table 3. From this table it is observed that COU–IND-3 possesses the lowest EA value and PTZ–IND-2 possesses the lowest IP value. This indicates that attachment of the –NH2 group at the donor and the –NO2 group at the acceptor part is more favourable.

To examine the process of spontaneous electron injection and dye regeneration we have calculated the oxidation potential of the studied dyes. The ground state oxidation potential (GSOP) is defined as the difference between the energies of the neutral and oxidized ground state of the dyes in solution. On the other hand, the excited state oxidation potential (ESOP) is defined as the sum of the GSOP and the first excitation energy (Eg) of the dyes. To obtain charge transportation the GSOP values of the dyes must lie below the redox potential of the I−/I3− electrolyte. Similarly, the ESOP values must lie above the conduction band, ECB, of TiO2 to trigger spontaneous electron injection and dye regeneration.23 The calculated GSOP and ESOP values of the dyes have been provided in Fig. 5.
 Fig. 5  Plot of the band alignment of the GSOP and ESOP of the (A) COU–BTZ, (B) PTZ–BTZ, (C) COU–IND and (D) PTZ–IND groups of dyes with respect to the redox potential of the I−/I3− redox couple and ECB of TiO2, respectively, where 1, 2, 3, 4′, 5′, 6′ and 7′ represent the substituents –CH3, –NH2, –OH, –CF3, –COCl, –F and –NO2, respectively. 
From Fig. 5(A and C) it is observed that for the COU–BTZ and COU–IND groups of dyes the GSOP values lie below the redox potential of the I−/I3− electrolyte couple and the ESOP values lie above the conduction band of TiO2. On the other hand, from Fig. 5(B and D) it is evident that for the PTZ–BTZ and PTZ–IND groups of dyes the GSOP values lie above the redox potential of the I−/I3− electrolyte (except the dyes PTZ–BTZ-2, PTZ–IND and PTZ–IND-2) and the ESOP values lie above the conduction band of TiO2. This indicates that the COU–BTZ and COU–IND groups of dyes are better candidates compared to the PTZ–BTZ and PTZ–IND groups of dyes for DSSCs.
To get further insight into the charge transfer process we have also calculated the driving force of regeneration (ΔGreg) and the thermodynamic driving force (ΔGinj) of the compounds and the values have been reported in Table 3. It is known that higher ΔGinj values of compounds indicate higher efficiency and the ΔGreg values must lie within a threshold limit of 0.2–0.3 eV depending on the type of solvent and other conditions employed.23 From Table 3 it is observed that the ΔGinj values are sufficiently high for all the dye systems and the PTZ–IND group of dyes possesses the maximum value. However, the ΔGreg values for the COU–BTZ and COU–IND groups of dyes are more close to the threshold values compared to the PTZ–BTZ and PTZ–IND groups of dyes. This implies that the COU–BTZ and COU–IND groups of dyes are more efficient and dye regeneration is possible in these compounds. Despite the low IP and high ΔGinj values of the PTZ–IND group of dyes these dyes are not suitable because of their very low ΔGreg values.

Eqn (10) shows that a large LHC value is necessary to obtain a high Jsc value. From Table 5 it is observed that the LHC values for the COU–BTZ and COU–IND groups of dyes are slightly higher compared to the PTZ–BTZ and PTZ–IND groups of dyes. It is also observed that dyes substituted with the –CF3 group possess the lowest value of the LHC. Taking the LHC into account it can be said that the Jsc values of the compounds will be slightly higher for the COU–BTZ and COU–IND groups of dyes than the rest.
From eqn (9) it can be said that high Voc is desirable for high energy conversion efficiency (η) of a photovoltaic device. We have calculated the Voc values of the dyes and the values have been reported in Table 5. From this table it is observed that the COU–BTZ and COU–IND groups of dyes possess higher values of Voc compared to the PTZ–BTZ and PTZ–IND groups of dyes. Thus, it can be said that the COU–BTZ and COU–IND groups of dyes will exhibit comparatively higher efficiency of energy conversion than the rest of the dye systems.
4.2 Reorganization energies, charge transfer integrals and charge transfer rates of the dyes
The reorganization energy (λ) is an important parameter describing the charge transfer processes in organic molecules. We have calculated the reorganization energies for holes (λh) and electrons (λe) and their values have been reported in Table 4. From this table it is observed that the λe values of the compounds are lower than the λh values. This result implies that the designed molecules will act as electron transport materials. From Table 4 it is also observed that the COU–BTZ group of dyes possesses the lowest value of λe among all the groups of dyes. Moreover, it is observed that compounds COU–BTZ-1 and COU–IND-5′ possess the minimum and maximum values of λe, respectively. This can be explained with the help of the plot of the frontier molecular orbitals of these compounds provided in Fig. S3 (in the ESI†). From this figure it is observed that in compound COU–BTZ-1 attachment of the –CH3 unit extends the extent of conjugation of the molecular backbone. Conversely, in compound COU–IND-5′ attachment of the –COCl unit decreases the extent of conjugation of the molecular backbone due to its bulky size. However, compounds COU–IND-6′ and PTZ–IND-6′ possess the lowest values of λe among the COU–IND and PTZ–IND groups of dyes, respectively. This is due to the small size of the –F unit, which helps to maintain the planarity of the compounds without any structural distortion.

We have also calculated the total reorganization energy (λtot) values of the compounds and the values have been provided in Table 4. A small value of λtot favors efficient electron–hole separation, which results in the mitigation of the recombination processes.23 From Table 4 it is observed that the COU–BTZ and COU–IND groups of dyes possess low values of λtot compared to the PTZ–BTZ and PTZ–IND groups of dyes. This indicates that the COU–BTZ and COU–IND groups of dyes have more efficient electron–hole separation and may have slower recombination processes compared to the other dyes.
We have calculated the electronic coupling matrix element or charge transfer integral values for electrons (V−) using the dimer model with the help of eqn (8) and the values have been reported in Table 4. As our investigated molecules do not have any crystal structure, we have performed this study by optimizing the dimer model where monomer molecules stacked in a co-facial arrangement. The arrangement of the stacked molecules has been presented in Fig. S4 (in the ESI†). The V values have been calculated by employing the functional M06-2X-D3. This functional includes the dispersion correction property and has been proven to be useful in the study of charge transfer properties.46
We have also calculated the charge transfer rates for electrons (kct−) using eqn (7) and the calculated values have been reported in Table 4. From this table it is observed that compound COU–BTZ-6′ possesses the highest value of kct− among all the groups of dyes. This is because of the low value of λe and high value of V− of this compound. From Table 4 it is also observed that the COU–BTZ and PTZ–BTZ groups of dyes possess the highest value of kct− among all the groups of dyes. This is because of the high V− values obtained for these compounds.
5 Electron density difference (EDD) maps
To gain insight into the type of charge seperation in the dyes after electron excitation, we have performed a systematic analysis of the electronic structures and determined the electron density difference (EDD) map for the dyes with the help of the Multiwfn package.62–64 The obtained EDD maps for the unsubstituted parent dyes have been provided in Fig. 6. In this figure the green and blue regions represent the increase and decrease in electron density due to excitation of electrons.
 Fig. 6  Electron density difference (EDD) maps for the unsubstituted parent dyes. 
From Fig. 6 it is observed that charge transfer has taken place from the donor unit to the acceptor unit during the S0 → S1 transition. Therefore, among the four unsubstituted parent dyes, the donor unit exhibits the minimum electron density, whereas the acceptor unit exhibits the maximum electron density.
5.1 Absorption properties
The absorption properties of the compounds have been calculated at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory using the TDDFT method where THF is chosen as a solvent. It has been already proven that long range corrected functional CAM-B3LYP suits excited state calculations best.45,47 The calculated values of the maximum wavelength of absorption (λmax), excitation energy (Eg), oscillator strength (fosc) and % contribution of the electronic transitions have been reported in Table 5.

From Table 5 it is observed that all the dyes absorb in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. It is also observed that the COU–BTZ and PTZ–BTZ groups of dyes exhibit higher λmax values compared to the COU–IND and PTZ–IND groups of dyes. Among the four groups of dyes, the COU–BTZ and PTZ–IND groups of dyes exhibit the maximum and minimum λmax values, respectively. This is due to the observed lowest and highest values of the dihedral angles of the COU–BTZ and COU–IND groups of dyes, respectively. From Table 5 it is also observed that the nature and position of the substituents affect the absorption properties of the compounds. It is observed that, in each group of dyes, compounds having the –NO2 substituent at the acceptor unit possess higher values of λmax. This is because of the observed low value of ΔH–L of these compounds. It is also evident that the electronic transitions with the highest wavelength of absorption occur primarily due to H → L transitions for all the compounds (Fig. 7).

6 Absorption on the TiO2 semiconducting surface
To monitor more realistic performance of the solar cells, the electronic and absorption properties of the dyes bound to the TiO2 semiconducting surface have been investigated. In this study, a (TiO2)5 cluster has been used to represent the TiO2 semiconducting surface. The dye sensitizers have been anchored to the semiconducting surface through the bidentate anchoring group, which has been proven to be the most ideal anchoring mode in DSSCs.23 The optimized geometries of the unsubstituted dye–TiO2 complexes along with their HOMO, LUMO and LUMO+1 plots have been presented in Fig. 8. From this figure it is observed that the HOMOs are delocalized over the donor part with a contribution from the π-bridge of the dyes and the LUMOs are delocalized over the acceptor part along with some portions of the TiO2 semiconductor surface. On the other hand, the LUMO+1 orbitals are fully concentrated on the TiO2 semiconductor surface.

We have measured the Ti–O bond lengths, which is presented in Fig. 9, and the values have been presented in Table 6. From this table it is observed that the Ti–O bond lengths are in the range of 2.019–2.052 Å. These values are in agreement with the theoretically measured Ti–O bond distances (2.03–2.24 Å) reported for various dye–TiO2 complexes.23,65 These values signify that our designed dyes undergo strong chemisorption on the TiO2 surface.

We have also calculated the values of ΔH–L and the ground state dipole moment (μg) of the dye–Ti5O10 complexes and the values have been reported in Table 6. From the comparison of Table 2 with Table 6 it is observed that the ΔH–L values of the dye–TiO2 complexes and the isolated dyes follow the same trend. Moreover, on comparison of Table 1 with Table 6 it is observed that the μg values of the dye–TiO2 complexes are higher than the μg values of the isolated dye molecules. This signifies that the charge transportation characteristics of the dyes get increased upon binding of the dyes to the TiO2 semiconducting surface.
For a detail correlation of the electronic structure with the FMOs, the partial density of states (PDOS) of the compounds has been calculated and the respective spectral data have been provided in Table S3 (in the ESI†). From Table S3 (ESI†), it is observed that the acceptor and donor units of all the dye–TiO2 complexes offer a maximum contribution to the HOMOs. However, the bridging unit and the anchoring group offer a minimum contribution to the HOMOs. However, the acceptor and donor units of compounds COU–BTZ and PTZ–BTZ and their derivatives have a maximum contribution to the LUMOs, whereas their bridging unit and anchoring group have a minimum contribution to the LUMOs. On the other hand, the bridging unit and the anchoring group of compounds COU–IND and PTZ–IND and their derivatives offer a maximum contribution to the LUMOs, whereas their acceptor and donor units have a minimum contribution to the LUMOs. In the case of all compounds, it has been observed that the Ti5O10 cluster offers a contribution only to the LUMOs with the maximum being observed for COU–IND and its derivatives. Therefore, from this section, it can be inferred that the PDOS spectra give a clear vision of the nature of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels. The PDOS spectra of the unsubstituted dye–Ti5O10 complexes have been provided in Fig. 10.

The molecular electrostatic potential surface (MEPS) is a tool which provides a qualitative explanation about the charge density distribution of the excited states.66 The MEPS plots of the unsubstituted dye–TiO2 complexes have been presented in Fig. 11. From this figure it is observed that the negative charge spreads over the TiO2 surface and the positive charge spreads over the dye molecules. From this observation it can be said that our designed dyes have significant charge transfer characteristics.

We have also studied the absorption properties of the dye–TiO2 complexes by employing the CAM-B3LYP functional and the results have been reported in Table 7. The λmax, fosc, and Eg values, transitions, and contributions of the orbitals have been reported in this table. From this table it is observed that the λmax values of the dye–TiO2 complexes have undergone a red shift compared to the isolated dye molecules. The absorption maxima for all the dye–TiO2 complexes are primarily due to the H → L electronic transition with configuration 52–99%. The corresponding spectra of the dye–TiO2 complexes have been presented in Fig. 12.

The working mechanism of DSSCs is that the dye molecule absorbs sunlight to produce an exciton (electron–hole pair), which splits only after reaching the dye–semiconducting surface interface. The binding energy is the amount of energy needed to pull apart the hole and electron from an electron–hole pair. The lower the binding energy, the easier will be the charge separation from the dye to the semiconducting surface.62,67 The exciton binding energy (Eb) can be described as Eb = ΔH–L − E1, where E1 is the optical band gap, i.e. the energy required for S0 → S1.68,69 We have provided the respective values of Eb in Table 7. From this table, it has been observed that the dyes COU–BTZ-7′, PTZ–BTZ-2, COU–IND-4′, and PTZ–IND-4′ exhibit comparatively lower binding energy than the rest of the dyes, which in turn leads to facile charge separation. On the other hand, all unsubstituted parent dye–TiO2 complexes exhibit maximum binding energy. In other words the transfer of electrons from the dye to the semiconducting surface will be most difficult in these complexes.
7 Conclusion
In this paper, we have designed and studied a series of dyes based on the D–π–A approach. We have performed a theoretical study on 32 compounds designed by incorporating four groups of dyes viz. COU–BTZ, PTZ–BTZ, COU–IND and PTZ–IND. In order to study their structural properties we have calculated the ground state dihedral angles of the compounds. The electronic properties viz. the μg, μe, and ΔH–L values of the compounds have also been envisaged. From the observed ΔH–L values of the compounds it is evident that the unsubstituted PTZ–BTZ dye possesses the lowest value of ΔH–L. Moreover, it is also noticed that the –NO2 substituent lowers the ΔH–L values of all the compounds to the maximum extent. The obtained IP and EA values of the compounds suggest that the COU–IND, PTZ–BTZ and PTZ–IND groups of dyes are effective candidates for the construction of DSSCs. However, the GSOP, ESOP, ΔGreg, ΔGinj, LHC and Voc values of the compounds suggest that the COU–BTZ and COU–IND groups of dyes are more efficient candidates for the fabrication of DSSCs. From the values of the observed total reorganization energy, λtot, it can be confirmed that the COU–BTZ and COU–IND groups of dyes are the best choice. Further, the charge transfer rate of the dyes reveals the electron transporting nature of our designed dyes. From the absorption properties of the dyes it has been observed that the COU–BTZ group of dyes possesses the maximum value of λmax and substitution at the acceptor unit by the –NO2 group shifts the λmax values of the compounds to the longer wavelength region. Thus, we can conclude that the COU–BTZ and COU–IND groups of dyes are more efficient candidates for the fabrication of DSSCs and substitution of the acceptor unit by the –NO2 group improves the performance of the designed dyes.
From the study of the structural and electronic properties of the dyes anchored to the TiO2 surface it has been observed that the ΔH–L values of the dyes get decreased and the λmax values of the complexes undergo a red shift compared to the isolated dye molecules. Therefore, it can be concluded that upon anchoring the studied dyes to the TiO2 surface the performance of the designed dyes is improved.
