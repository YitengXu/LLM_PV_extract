    , Accepted 20th February 2015First published on 2nd March 2015AbstractIn an aqueous-phase system, AgInS2 quantum dot (QD) sensitized TiO2 photoanodes were prepared in situ by the reaction of β-In2S3 nanocrystals and as-prepared TiO2/Ag2S–QD electrodes, followed by a covering process with a ZnS passivation layer. A facile successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method was adopted to obtain TiO2/Ag2S–QD electrodes. β-In2S3 nanocrystals synthesized by the chemical bath deposition (CBD) process serve as the reactant of AgInS2 as well as a buffer layer between the interfaces of TiO2 and AgInS2–QDs. A polysulfide electrolyte and a Pt-coated FTO glass count electrode were used to test the photovoltaic performance of the constructed devices. The characteristics of the sensitized photoelectrodes were studied in more detail by electron microscopy, X-ray techniques, and optical and photoelectric performance measurements. AgInS2 is the main photo-sensitizer for TiO2/AgInS2–QD/In2S3 electrodes and excess In2S3 appears on the surface of the electrodes. Based on the optimal Ag2S SILAR cycle, the best photovoltaic performance of the prepared TiO2/AgInS2–QD/In2S3 electrode with the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 7.87 mA cm−2 and power conversion efficiency (η) of 0.70% under full one-sun illumination was achieved.
Introduction
Semiconductor quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) have recently drawn significant attention since inorganic quantum dots (QDs) with a narrow band gap and appropriate band positions are considered to be next generation alternative sensitizers to costly dyes in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).1–8 In comparison with those binary ones, multicomponent chalcogenide semiconductor nanomaterials, such as CuInS2, AgInS2 and related materials have attracted much attention in recent years for application in solar light energy conversion systems.9–11 AgInS2 can crystallize in both chalcopyrite and orthorhombic phases exhibiting direct band gaps of 1.87 and 1.98 eV, respectively,12 which is suitable for the absorption of visible light. It can form a good matching heterojunction with Ag2S,13,14 Cu2ZnSnS4,15 CdS,16 or a polymer matrix17,18 due to its suitable lattice constant, making it a promising alternative for solar cell materials. Importantly, AgInS2 is low-toxic as opposed to the cadmium chalcogenides.
As one of the most important I–III–VI materials, AgInS2 was extensively studied for its electrical and optical properties. So far, most of the studies have focused on the synthesis strategies of AgInS2 nanocrystals (NCs) for biological applications.19–23 Several methods have been adopted to fabricate AgInS2 thin films such as chemical spray pyrolysis,24,25 physical vapor deposition,26 and electrochemical deposition.27 However these traditional preparation routes need harsh reaction conditions and the synthesized AgInS2 films have a poor crystal structure. Chemical bath deposition (CBD) and successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) routes were considered convenient ways to synthesize ternary sulphide thin films.28,29 Very recently, the AgInS2 NCs17 and Cu-doped AgInS218 NCs have been incorporated in organic–inorganic hybrid optoelectronic devices. Very poor total energy conversion efficiency is obtained for solar cells made by using organic capped AgInS2 NCs because the insulating organic ligands inhibit electron injection to core NCs.30 It should be noted that ITO/ZnO/ZnS/AgInS2/P3HT/Pt hybrid solar cells showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.11%, which is the highest value ever reported for ZnO-based all-solid-state hybrid solar cells.31
Up to now, there have been only a few reports on AgInS2 NCs sensitized solar cells. Nag et al. prepared AgInS2 NCs by post-synthesis annealing of NC dispersion that modifies the size and defect density of the NCs, and solution processed AgInS2 NCs were used to form the photoanode of the QDSSCs exhibiting a PCE of 0.8% and a short-circuit current density of 4.62 mA cm−2.32 Torimoto et al. reported sandwich-type solar cells fabricated with the ZnS–AgInS2-loaded ZnO nanorod electrode as a working electrode and an acetonitrile solution containing the redox couple of I−/I3− exhibited a photoresponse in the visible light region.33 It has been reported in the literature that the high conversion efficiency of ternary chalcogenide QDSSCs is generally caused by interfacial charge-transfer processes at the TiO2 film and QD sensitizer.34,35 Approaches such as decreasing the charge recombination within the QDSSCs by modifying the blocking layer,36 doping of CdS QDs with Mn2+ to improve the lifetime of trapped electrons,37 the deposition of Ru-dyes and QDs as hybrid photosensitizers,38 and a buffer layer39 have been carried out. Applying a buffer layer such as In2S3 between TiO2 and CuInS2 can suppress the interface electron recombination and improve the cell performance.40,41 In2S3, a typical III–VI group sulphide, exists in three different structural forms: α-In2S3 (defect cubic structure), β-In2S3 (defect spinel structure) and γ-In2S3 (layered hexagonal structure). In fact, β-In2S3 is a good n-type photoactive semiconductor with a direct band gap of about 2.0 eV, a relatively large exciton Bohr radius approximately 34 nm and a high carrier mobility.42,43 To further improve the performance of chalcogenide-based solar cells, an intermediate band gap layer can be incorporated into a CIS solar cell to increase its photoelectric performance.35 For this purpose, AgInS2 QDSSC embedded β-In2S3 layers are developed.
Herein, for the first time, we fabricated AgInS2–QD/In2S3 co-sensitized solar cells by a facile aqueous-phase synthesis route. The growth process of AgInS2–QDs/In2S3 on the TiO2 film has been demonstrated in detail. By using the Pt counter electrode (CE) and a polysulfide electrolyte to assemble a QDSSC, the AgInS2–QDs/In2S3 co-sensitizers provide a PCE of 0.70% and a short-circuit current density of 7.87 mA cm−2 under one-sun illumination.
Experimental section
Materials
Silver(I) acetate (Ag(OAc), 99+%), sodium sulfide (Na2S·9H2O, 98+%), indium chloride (InCl3·4H2O, 98+%), thioacetamide (CH3CSNH2, 98+%), citric acid (C6H8O7·H2O, 98+%), ethanol (99.5%), zinc acetate (Zn(OAc)2·2H2O, 99+%), sulfur (S, 99.5%), and potassium chloride (KCl, 99.5%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. (Shanghai, China). TiO2 powder (P25, a mixed phase of 70% anatase and 30% rutile; average size 25 nm+) from Degussa (Japan) was used to prepare TiO2 anatase nanoparticles for photoelectrodes. Ethylcellulose and terpineol from Fluka (Germany) were used to suspend TiO2 particles in viscous solutions. All the materials were used without further purification. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass substrate (2.3 mm thick, 14 Ω □−1) was purchased from Nippon Sheet Glass.
Preparation of TiO2/Ag2S–QD electrodes
Mesoporous TiO2 electrodes were prepared by following a method reported earlier.44,45 In brief, the FTO glass was cleaned in a detergent solution using an ultrasonic bath for 15 min, and then rinsed with water and ethanol. Two layers of TiO2 were deposited on the FTO glass, a blocking layer and an active layer. The blocking layer was deposited by treating the glass in a 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min followed by annealing at 500 °C for 30 min. The active TiO2 layer (P25 paste) was coated on top of the blocking layer by the doctor blade technique. The film was dried at 125 °C for 6 min followed by annealing at 500 °C for another 30 min. A post treatment process of the calcined film was similar to that of the blocking layer. The thickness of the TiO2 mesoporous electrode was approximately 9 μm, measured by an optical profiler (Wyko NT9100, Veeco Co., USA). TiO2/Ag2S–QD electrodes were subsequently prepared by the SILAR method.46 The electrode was dipped in 0.02 M aqueous Ag(OAc) solution for 30 s, rinsed with water, subsequently immersed for 30 s in 0.05 M aqueous Na2S solution and further rinsed with water. Each series of two immersions was considered as one SILAR cycle.
Fabrication of the AgInS2–QD/In2S3/ZnS QDSSCs
QD-sensitized solar cells consisting of AgInS2 QDs sensitizer with the In2S3 buffer layer were prepared by CBD of In2S3 and in situ reaction with TiO2/Ag2S–QD films using a one-step method. A precursor aqueous solution of In2S3 was prepared from a mixture of InCl3 (0.01 M) and CH3CSNH2 (0.04 M). During the mixing procedure, C6H8O7 (0.06 M) was added to the chemical solution for the formation of an indium complex. The resulting clear mixture was transferred into a 70 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, holding a vertically oriented FTO glass substrate (with a Ag2S/TiO2 film), which was then sealed and maintained at 150 °C for 3 h. The substrate was then rinsed with water and ethanol and dried at room temperature. The electrode was marked as TiO2/AgInS2(n)–QD/In2S3 according to the different Ag2S SILAR cycles (where n is the Ag2S SILAR cycle). All the electrodes analyzed in this study have been coated with ZnS, carried out by a two SILAR cycle which involves dipping twice alternatively in 0.1 M Zn(OAc)2 and 0.1 M Na2S aqueous solution for 1 min per dip. The QDSSC was sealed in a sandwich structure with a spacer film (50 μm thick polyester film, DuPont) by using the Pt-coated FTO glass. The space between the electrodes was filled with the polysulfide electrolyte which consisted of Na2S (2 M), S (2 M), and KCl (0.2 M), using pure water as the solvent. A mask with a window of 0.25 cm2 was clipped on the photoanode side to define the active area of the cell.
Characterization
High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained using a JEM 2100 F (JEOL Co., Japan) operating at 200 kV. The surface morphology and structure of the resulting films were studied using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, S-4800, Hitachi, Japan). The crystal structure was investigated by an X-ray diffraction technique (XRD, D/max 2550 V, Rigaku, Japan) with Cu Kα (λ = 0.154 nm) radiation at 40 kV and 200 mA in 2θ ranging from 20° to 80°. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on an ESCALab MKII X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a spectrophotometer (Lambda 950, Perkin-Elmer Co., USA). The photocurrent–voltage characteristics (J–V curves) of QDSSCs were measured using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter under illumination of simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2) provided by a Newport solar simulator (Model 96160) with an AM 1.5G filter. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were recorded as a function of wavelength from 350 to 800 nm using a specially designed IPCE system (Newport, USA) for the QDSSCs.
Results and discussion
In an aqueous-phase system, AgInS2–QD sensitized TiO2 photoanodes were prepared in situ by the reaction of β-In2S3 nanocrystals and as-prepared TiO2/Ag2S–QD electrodes. TiO2/Ag2S–QD electrodes were obtained by a facile successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. β-In2S3 nanocrystals synthesized by the chemical bath deposition (CBD) process serve as the reactant of AgInS2 as well as the buffer layer between the interfaces of TiO2 and AgInS2 QDs. The overall reactions are presented as follows: Ag+ + S2− → Ag2S(1)(The reaction was processed on TiO2 films.) L ⇄ L− + H+ (L is citric acid)(2) In3+ + L− ⇄ InL3(3) CH3CSNH2 + H+ → CH3CNH+ + H2S(4) H2S ⇄ HS− + H+ ⇄ S2− + 2H+(5) In3+ + S2− → In2S3(6) Ag2S + In2S3 → 2AgInS2(7)
The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the TiO2/AgInS2–QD/In2S3 composite shown in Fig. 1 clearly depicts the crystalline lattice fringes of the involved species. The lattice spacing distance of 0.352 nm, illustrated in the right zone of the image, corresponds to the (101) plane of anatase TiO2. The lattices with spacing distances of 0.334 and 0.325 nm around the TiO2 particle encompassed by red lines correspond to the (112) plane of the tetragonal AgInS2 (JCPDS file no. 75-0117) and the (311) plane of the In2S3 (JCPDS file no. 84-1385), respectively. The In2S3 coating using the CBD method is in close contact with both AgInS2 QDs and TiO2 particles.

Fig. 2 shows a series of color changes for the TiO2 electrodes after sensitization in the reaction process. The TiO2/In2S3 electrode was prepared as a reference. The TiO2 film was originally white and semi-transparent, becoming black-brown when it was coated with Ag2S QDs and red-brown when it was coated with AgInS2–QDs/In2S3. Due to the quantum confinement effect in the optics, the color for the TiO2/AgInS2–QD/In2S3 electrode is distinct with black bulk AgInS2. It was also found that the color of the TiO2/AgInS2–QD/In2S3 electrode changes from pale red-brown to dark reddish brown, indicating the increase of the AgInS2–QD layer thickness (see Fig. 1S†). The present claybank color on TiO2/AgInS2–QD/In2S3 electrodes indicates the deposition of In2S3 films on the bare FTO glass.

FESEM images in Fig. 3 demonstrate the surface topography of the electrodes at different reaction stages. The SILAR method was used to deposit Ag2S on TiO2 films as the basic electrode, and the growth mechanism of the Ag2S–QDs on the TiO2 films was monitored with FESEM imaging (see Fig. 3a and b). It is clear that the entire surface of the FTO substrate is covered uniformly and densely with TiO2 nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 3a. The average particle diameter is approximately 30 nm and the average pore size among TiO2 nanoparticles is less than 10 nm. After being assembled with Ag2S for 6 cycles, the TiO2 nanoparticle structure is retained, and the Ag2S particles can be generated in the pores as well as on the surface of porous TiO2 films as shown in Fig. 3b. In addition, the small diameter of pores of the TiO2 films restricts further growth of the Ag2S particles. Thus, Ag2S particles are smaller in the porous TiO2 films, meaning that the size of Ag2S is within the scope of the quantum dot. Fig. 3c shows the surface topography of the TiO2/In2S3 film prepared by the CBD method as a comparison. The surface of the as-deposited film shows a uniform granular structure with very well-defined grain boundaries and with some larger grains dispersed on the film surface. The grains have an irregular round shape. Fig. 3d shows the surface morphology of the AgInS2(6)–QD/In2S3 co-sensitized TiO2 electrode. It was found that AgInS2 nanoparticles with a pyramid-like shape appear on the surface of the film. The surface morphology of TiO2/AgInS2–QD/In2S3 films prepared with different Ag2S SILAR cycles seem to be slightly affected by the Ag2S SILAR cycles (see Fig. 2S†). All the samples show a similar surface morphology; however, as the Ag2S SILAR cycle increases, the pyramid-like structure becomes denser and the size of AgInS2 particles becomes larger on the surface of the electrode.

The valence states and composition of the surface of the TiO2/AgInS2(6)–QD/In2S3 electrode were further investigated by XPS (see Fig. 4).

The Ag 3d, In 3d, S2p, Ti2p and O1s were examined, respectively, which confirms the presence of these elements in the typical sample. The binding energies of Ag 3d3/2 and Ag 3d5/2 for AgInS2 were located at 373.5 eV and 367.4 eV with a peak splitting of 6 eV, which is consistent with the standard reference XPS of Ag+ ions. The In 3d peaks were located at 444.4 eV and 451.9 eV with a peak splitting of 7.5 eV, matching well with In3+ ions. The S 2p peak splitting of 161.2 eV and 162.3 eV with a peak splitting of 1.1 eV corresponds to a binding energy of S2−.47 The Ti 2p spectra exhibits two peaks corresponding to the binding energies of 458.5 eV (Ti 2p3/2) and 464.2 eV (Ti 2p1/2), resulting from the Ti of TiO2. The binding energies of O 1s were located at two peaks, the peak at 529.9 eV, resulting from the crystal lattice oxygen of TiO2 and the peak at 532 eV, corresponding to the hydroxyl oxygen. It can be seen in Table 1 through the quantification of peaks that there are excess In and S elements according to the stoichiometric coefficient of AgInS2, showing that the sensitizers consist of AgInS2 and In2S3 over the electrode. There are excess O elements according to the stoichiometric coefficient of TiO2 attributing to the hydroxyl oxygen on the surface of the sample.

To explore the formation process of AgInS2–QD/In2S3 co-sensitized electrodes, the TiO2 electrodes after sensitization at different reaction stages were monitored by XRD analyses in Fig. 5. There are inconspicuous Ag2S diffraction peaks according to similar XRD patterns of the TiO2/Ag2S(6) electrode and the TiO2 electrode, showing that the size of Ag2S is in the quantum dot range. In addition, it is also not easy to determine the AgInS2 phase (JCPDS file no. 75-0117) over the AgInS2(6)–QD/In2S3 co-sensitized TiO2 electrode due to the smaller size of AgInS2 QDs and the higher intensity of the TiO2 (P25) diffraction peak. However, the main diffraction peaks of β-In2S3 such as (111), (400) and (511) (JCPDS file no. 84-1385) appear on the XRD pattern of the AgInS2–QD(6)/In2S3 co-sensitized electrode, indicating that there is excess β-In2S3 over the electrode.
 Fig. 5  XRD patterns of plain TiO2 film, TiO2/Ag2S(6)–QD electrode prepared by 6 cycles of Ag2S SILAR deposition, TiO2/In2S3 electrode prepared by In2S3 CBD deposition and TiO2/AgInS2(6)–QD/In2S3 electrode. 
UV-vis absorption spectroscopy was performed to track the formation of AgInS2–QD/In2S3 co-sensitized electrodes and investigate the suitability for photovoltaic application. Fig. 6 shows the absorption spectra of the correlative electrodes during the preparation process of the TiO2/AgInS2–QD/In2S3 photoanode from the plain TiO2, TiO2/Ag2S–QD to TiO2/AgInS2–QD/In2S3 electrodes. The TiO2/In2S3 electrode was chosen as a comparison. The spectrum shows that the plain TiO2 can mainly absorb UV light with wavelengths smaller than 420 nm. The TiO2/Ag2S–QD electrode can absorb UV to near-infrared light, but its optical absorption ability is rather weak, probably being bad for solar cell performance. The TiO2 film with In2S3 CBD deposition, the light absorbance of the electrode was enhanced in the visible region, and its absorption band edge is about 530 nm. The prepared TiO2/AgInS2–QD/In2S3 electrode has excellent optical absorption performance not only in the UV region, but also in the visible region. A shoulder appears between 530 and 600 nm with a long tail extending to longer wavelengths, which is mainly due to the formation of the AgInS2 layer coated on the TiO2 electrode. These results confirm that the AgInS2 layer can effectively improve the light absorption property of the TiO2 film. It was also found that the absorption spectra of the TiO2/AgInS2–QD/In2S3 electrodes obtained by CBD of In2S3 and in situ reaction with different cycles of Ag2S SILAR deposition on the TiO2 film are similar (see Fig. 3S†). The absorption spectra of the prepared TiO2/AgInS2–QD/In2S3 electrodes were red-shifted with the increase of the Ag2S SILAR cycles probably because of the increase of the AgInS2–QD size or the increase of the AgInS2–QD layer thickness. The enhanced absorption in the longer wavelength region is probably due to the remission of the quantum confinement effect on the AgInS2 QDs.

We fabricated QDSSCs using FTO/TiO2/AgInS2–QD/In2S3/ZnS as the photoanode and a Pt electrode as the cathode along with a polysulfide electrolyte between the electrodes. Fig. 7 shows schematic descriptions of the working principle of a QDSSC and its charge transfer mechanism, respectively. β-In2S3 QDs obtained by the CBD method react with the as-prepared Ag2S QDs in the holes of TiO2 films to form AgInS2@In2S3 QDs and there are also excess AgInS2 and In2S3 particles on the surface of the electrodes. AgInS2 QDs absorb photons and generate electron-hole pairs. These photo-generated electrons can be efficiently transferred from AgInS2 QDs to the mesoporous TiO2 layer, finally collected by the FTO glass contact. Moreover, there are non-radial recombination electrons and holes via the defect state as marked in Fig. 7(b) with a green dotted arrow.32 At the same time, the photo-generated holes are scavenged by the polysulfide based redox electrolyte. The AgInS2–QD/In2S3 surface was passivated with a wider band gap semiconductor (ZnS, 3.6 eV)48 to prevent the leakage of current from AgInS2–QD/In2S3 to the electrolyte.

Fig. 8 presents the photocurrent–voltage characteristics (J–V curves) of the TiO2/AgInS2–QD(6)/In2S3 co-sensitized photonaode with a Pt counter electrode and a polysulfide electrolyte. The TiO2/In2S3 electrode prepared by the CBD method of In2S3 on the TiO2 film for 3 h and the TiO2/Ag2S(6)–QD electrode prepared by the SILAR method were used for comparison. The intermediate values for the main resulting photovoltaic parameters based on five parallel cell devices and the error intervals of PCE (η) are summarized in Table 2. For the cell based on just Ag2S(6)–QDs or a In2S3 sensitized TiO2 photo-electrode, a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 0.49 or 1.19, an open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 0.19 or 0.23 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.34 or 0.31 and a PCE (η) of 0.03 or 0.08 were revealed, respectively. The poor photovoltaic performance may be attributed to the poor light absorption ability or the unmatched energy level. For AgInS2(6)–QD/In2S3 co-sensitized QDSSC, the J–V curve reveals that Jsc = 7.87 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.32 V, and η = 0.70%, which are higher than those of TiO2/Ag2S(6)–QD and TiO2/In2S3 electrodes. The higher photocurrent density and efficiency are probably because of the broader light absorption spectrum and the better charge carrier generation ability of AgInS2 QDs for the AgInS2(6)–QD/In2S3 co-sensitized TiO2 photo-electrode. In general, the current density for QDSSCs is determined by the initial number of photo-generated charge carriers, the electron injection efficiency from QD-sensitizers to photo-electrodes, and the recombination rate between the injected electrons and holes of excited QDs or redox species in the electrolyte. IPCE is defined as the number of photo-generated charge carriers contributing to the current per incident photon. Fig. 9 compares the IPCE spectra of the QDSSCs. The IPCE spectra of the QDSSCs are basically consistent with the corresponding UV-Vis spectra shown in Fig. 6. TiO2/AgInS2–QD(6)/In2S3 QDSSC shows a maximum IPCE of about 37% from 500 to 625 nm, which is much higher than that of TiO2/In2S3 and TiO2/Ag2S(6)–QD electrodes. Therefore, we believe that AgInS2–QDs are the main photo-sensitizers. On the other hand, the lower FF indicates the increase of carrier recombination on the interfaces between the TiO2 and QD sensitizer or the electrolyte and CE. It is well known that Pt is not a good catalyst for polysulfide regeneration, which leads to poor fill factors for QDSSCs because their surface activity and conductivity are suppressed as a result of adsorption of the sulfur atom.49 The lower open-circuit photovoltage of TiO2/AgInS2–QD(6)/In2S3 QDSSC may be due to the surface defects of the synthesized AgInS2 QDs. β-In2S3 serves not only as the reactant of AgInS2 but also as an intermediate band gap layer that may change the unmatched band alignments in the heterostructure between TiO2 and AgInS2 QDs. However, the excess β-In2S3 particles on the surface of TiO2/AgInS2–QD/In2S3 co-sensitized photoanodes lead to inhomogeneous In2S3 deposition, which may affect the surface state of the AgInS2 QDs.

In addition, based on the same construction for the given TiO2/AgInS2–QD/In2S3 QDSSCs system, it is reasonable that the photocurrent density and energy conversion efficiency are directly affected by the initial Ag2S SILAR cycles (see Fig. 4S† and Table 1S†). On increasing the Ag2S SILAR deposition from 2 cycles to 6 cycles, the Jsc of TiO2/AgInS2–QD/In2S3 photoanodes increases substantially from 3.39 to 7.87 mA cm−2. The increase of Jsc is attributed to the extension of the light absorption range and the increase in absorption ability with the red-shift of the absorption onset of AgInS2–QD/In2S3 sensitizer. The increase of the incorporated amount of AgInS2–QDs not only contributes to absorb more photons to generate more photoexcited electrons, but also form a uniform and dense shell to reduce direct contact areas between the bare TiO2 surface and the polysulfide electrolyte.50,51 However, the Jsc and η were found to decrease when the Ag2S coating increased to 8 cycles. The possible reason for the reduced cell performance may be attributed to the aggregation and growth of the Ag2S QDs (See Fig. 2S†), which result in the presence of subsequently synthesized AgInS2 QDs with no direct contact with the TiO2, leading to block the infiltration of the electrolyte into the photoelectrode, thereby decreasing the regeneration efficiency of the solar cell.52,53
Conclusions
As one of the most important I–III–VI materials, AgInS2 was extensively studied for its electrical and optical properties, and the reports about AgInS2 QD sensitized solar cells are quite few. In this study, for the first time, we have presented a facile aqueous-phase synthesis route to prepare QD-sensitized photoelectrodes consisting of AgInS2–QD/In2S3 co-sensitizers based on the CBD method of In2S3 and in situ reaction with TiO2/Ag2S–QD films obtained by the SILAR method. AgInS2–QDs are the main photo-sensitizers. AgInS2 nanoparticles with a pyramid-like shape and excess In2S3 layers were found on the surface of the TiO2/AgInS2–QD/In2S3 electrodes. The TiO2/AgInS2(6)–QD/In2S3 QDSSC shows a better photovoltaic performance with Jsc of 7.87 mA cm−2, η of 0.70% and a maximum IPCE of about 37% which is higher than those of the TiO2/Ag2S(6)–QD and TiO2/In2S3 QDSSCs which can be attributed to the broader light absorption spectrum and the better charge carrier generation ability of AgInS2 QDs for the AgInS2(6)–QD/In2S3 co-sensitized TiO2 photo-electrode. The absorption spectra of the prepared TiO2/AgInS2–QD/In2S3 electrodes were red-shifted with the increase of the Ag2S SILAR cycles probably because of the increase of AgInS2–QD size or the increase of the AgInS2–QD layer thickness. Based on the same construction for the given TiO2/AgInS2–QD/In2S3QDSSC system, the photocurrent density and energy conversion efficiency are directly affected by the initial Ag2S SILAR cycles. We expect that this facile synthesis method would provide an insight into the fabrication of heterojunction thin film solar cells based on multicomponent chalcogenide.
