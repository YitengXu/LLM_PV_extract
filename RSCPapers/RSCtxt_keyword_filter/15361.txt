    , Accepted 22nd March 2022First published on 23rd March 2022AbstractTo increase the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs), the exploitation of excellent volatile solid additives is an important aspect for morphology optimization and performance stabilization. Here, we introduce a simple volatile solid additive 2,6-dichloroiodobenzene (DCIB) for OSCs, which carries one iodine (I) atom and two chlorine (Cl) atoms on the benzene ring. The additive promoted the formation of a continuous interpenetrating network and the orderly arrangement of molecules in the active layer by enhanced intermolecular interaction, which realized lower recombination and higher carrier lifetime in the optimized devices, ultimately obtaining higher mobilities and higher PCEs of 17.02% for PM6:Y6 OSCs. It is worth noting that the stability of the DCIB-treated devices is greatly improved, and the device efficiency remains at 95% of the initial efficiency after 25 days of storage in nitrogen atmosphere. This work provides a new volatile solid additive for the OSC system and its potential for future large-scale preparation.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have been widely studied due to their unique advantages, such as low cost, light weight, and roll-to-roll printing.1–3 In recent years, with the continuous development of polymer donors and non-fullerene acceptors, particularly Y6 and Y6-serial derivatives, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of single-junction OSCs have climbed up to 19%, providing a brilliant prospect for photovoltaic industrialization.4–7 Beyond material innovation, morphology manipulation is crucial to device performance. Nowadays, the methods of morphology manipulation commonly adopted in labs are solvent engineering, thermal annealing (TA), solvent vapor annealing (SVA), and additive engineering.8–11 Additive engineering is widely used for morphology and efficiency improvement, sometimes along with stability enhancement.12–14
Recently, most reported high-efficiency OSCs have used additive engineering. Traditional additives such as 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) are widely used.15–17 Due to their high boiling points, they usually prolong the drying time and rearrange the donor and acceptor molecules in the blended system, thus manipulating the morphology and performance.18 However, extensive work has demonstrated that such additives are not satisfying in terms of device repeatability and stability.19 Besides, these conventional additives may be better for fullerene OSCs but are poor for non-fullerene OSCs, mainly because they are less volatile and selectively soluble with fullerene acceptors but are not compatible with non-fullerene acceptors (probably because the planarity of the conjugated molecular backbone is very different from that of fullerene spheres).20 Currently, the phase morphology optimization of blend films in non-fullerene systems still uses the conventional method that has been mostly proposed in the fullerene system. Therefore, it is crucial to find more suitable methods and new additives for non-fullerene OSCs that can optimize the morphology as well as simultaneously maintain device stability and reproducibility.
It has been reported in the literature that the volatile solid additives hold promise for improving stability and reproducibility in non-fullerene OSCs.17–23 The amount of volatile solid additives need not be precisely controlled, such as in the case of DTT, An and DIB reported by Cui and our group.17,21,22 In other words, this method is not limited to a small amount of additives for the active layer, such as a volume ratio of 0.5% with DIO for blended systems, which are very difficult to achieve in precise operation. Generally, a large amount of volatile solid additives has been added in blended systems of the active layer, generally measured at a concentration of 10 mg mL−1, which excludes the error range solvent effect and decreases the experiment complexity.22 Actually, the use of volatile solid additives is an acclaimed choice for additive engineering, but the insufficient species of volatile solid additives need to be replenished.
In this paper, we introduce a new simple volatile solid additive, 2,6-dichloroiodobenzene (DCIB), into PM6:Y6-based devices to explore its potential for morphology manipulation and performance stabilization. It was chosen because the excessive introduction of conventional additives would become an impurity in the PM6:Y6 film that ultimately impaired the device efficiency and stability.17,23 Another reason is that the halogen atoms (iodine (I) and chlorine (Cl)) of DCIB may afford diverse weak-bonding interactions for the PM6:Y6 system. Finally, for the additive-doped PM6:Y6 active layer, the phase separation morphology becomes denser and steadier, and the contrastive UV-Vis absorption of the pure and blended films demonstrated that there exists enhanced intermolecular interaction between DCIB and the donor/acceptor molecules. When the doping amount of DCBI is 10 mg mL−1, the phase separation morphology of the PM6:Y6 films exhibits optimal device performance, which affords a PCE of up to 17.02% with an FF of 75.69% as well as prospective device stability with little decay (under 5%) during the 25 day aging test.
2. Result and discussion
2.1. Device performance
The chemical structures of the photoactive materials are shown in Fig. 1, with the active layer donor being PM6 (Fig. 1a) and the acceptor being Y6 (Fig. 1b). DICB (Fig. 1c) is an inexpensive and easily purchased chemical material with a richly conjugated benzene ring and delocalized electrons. We fabricated OSCs with different amounts of DICB as the additive in conventional devices with the structure of indium tin oxide (ITO) glass/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene) (PEDOT):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS)/PM6:Y6/phenyl(2-naphthyl)diphenylphosphine oxide (Phen-NaDPO)/Ag (Fig. 1d). The detailed steps of device preparation and optimization, blended film measurement, and material purchase information are described in the ESI.†

To evaluate the effect of DCIB as an additive in the PM6:Y6 system, we prepared a series of PM6:Y6-based OSC devices with different concentrations of DCIB, and the current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 1e, S1 and Table S1.† Meanwhile, the relevant photovoltaic parameters of the optimal devices are presented in Table 1. From Fig. 1e and Table 1, it is obvious that the device without additive treatment (w/o additives) shows a relatively low efficiency of 15.36%; however, after doping with the optimal additive concentration, the efficiency of the device is dramatically increased, and the PCE of the optimal PM6:Y6 OSCs with 10 mg mL−1 DCIB is 17.02%, which is accompanied with a significant enhancement of the fill factor (FF: 70.78% to 75.69%) and short-circuit current density (Jsc: 25.23 mA cm−2 to 26.49 mA cm−2). Compared with the undoped devices, the series resistances (Rs) and parallel resistances (RSH) of the devices at the optimum concentration vary from 3.31 Ω cm2 to 2.64 Ω cm2 and 2114.16 Ω cm2 to 5571.03 Ω cm2, respectively. The decrease of Rs and the increase of the RSH indicate that the introduction of additives successfully increases the extraction rate of excitons and decreases recombination, which directly benefit the Jsc and FF.

Furthermore, it can be obviously seen from the external quantum efficiency (EQE, Fig. 1f) measurements that the enhancement of Jsc for the DCIB-treated optimal devices is mainly due to the stronger photoresponse in the range of 450 nm to 800 nm compared with that of the untreated devices, which coincides well with the UV-Vis absorption of the PM6:Y6 films with or without treatment with DCIB (Fig. S2†). A more important point is the slight red-shift of the EQE response of the DCIB-treated devices, which can be attributed to the hauling force of intermolecular interaction between DCIB and the donor/acceptor molecules, which will be discussed below. By ftting calculations, the integrated Jsc values are 24.58 mA cm−2 and 25.97 mA cm−2 for the w/o devices and the DCIB-treated optimal devices, respectively, and both have a less than 3% mismatch (Table 1).
2.2. Intermolecular interaction
To further understand the impact of DCIB in the active layer, we tested the UV-Vis absorption of the pure and blended films treated with DCIB. From Fig. 2a, we can find that the polymer pure film PM6 has a broad absorption with shoulder peaks at 575 nm and 617 nm; when the optimal concentration (10 mg mL−1) of DCIB is introduced, the stretching vibration peak becomes more obvious at 579 nm and 621 nm, and the slightly red-shifted 0–0 (617 versus 621 nm) and 0–1 (575 versus 579 nm) peaks demonstrate stronger molecular aggregation.24 Besides, the intensity ratios of the 0–0 transition and 0–1 transition are 1.05 and 1.07 for PM6 and PM6+DCIB, respectively, and the intensity ratios of the 0–0 transition and 0–2 transition are 2.32 and 2.47 for PM6 and PM6+DCIB, respectively. This phenomenon may be attributed to the reordered arrangement of PM6 molecules.17 However, as shown in Fig. 2b, it is clearly observed that the absorption of Y6 treated with DCIB is significantly red-shifted by 16 nm (from 827 nm shifted to 843 nm) in comparison with that of the pure Y6 film, which may be attributed to the change of molecular stacking and enhanced intermolecular interaction.25,26

2.3. Charge extraction, transport and recombination dynamics
In order to figure out the main reason for the FF enhancement, exciton generation and dissociation of the devices treated under different conditions were investigated separately. The current density measured under a simulated solar light source is called the photocurrent density (Jlight), which is composed of the dark current density (Jdark) and photogenerated current density (Jph), and the relationship between these three parameters can be defined as Jph = Jlight+ Jdark. When the reverse bias voltage reaches a certain level, Jph will become the saturated current density (Jsat) and the carriers will all be pumped away under the action of the built-in electric field.27Fig. 3a depicts the value of Jph at different effective bias voltages (Veff), where Veff can be defined as V0 − Vappl, where V0 represents the bias voltage and Vappl represents the bias voltage corresponding to Jph = 0. When Veff is 3 V, Jph is saturated, and the saturation voltages are 27.15 mA cm−2 (10 mg mL−1 DCIB) and 25.86 mA cm−2 (w/o additives). Fig. 3b plots the exciton dissociation rate (P(E,T)) at different bias voltages, which can be defined as P(E,T) = Jph(V)/Jsat. Using the defining formula, we can calculate that P(E,T) without additive treatment under the condition of short-circuit current is 96.50% and the P(E,T) under the condition of optimal additive concentration is 97.82%. This can indicate that the DCIB additive can improve the dissociation efficiency of excitons. Detailed information on saturation current density and exciton dissociation rates for different treatment conditions are listed in Table S2.†

Curves of (e) transient photovoltage and (f) transient photocurrent. Plots of electron mobility (g) and hole mobility (h) under different treatment conditions. 
We also characterized the variation of JSC and VOC with the intensity of the simulated light source (I) to study the charge transport dynamics. To clarify the relationship between the variation of the open-circuit voltage and the intensity of the simulated light source, we use the empirical formula , where K, T and q represent the Boltzmann constant, Kelvin temperature and meta-charge, respectively.28,29 In general, the trap-assisted combination tends to be weakest when the value of n tends to 1. We can find from Fig. 3c that the n-value of the untreated device is 1.26 and the n-value of the DCIB additive-treated device is 1.19, with the n-value gradually decreasing, indicating that the DCIB solid additive can inhibit trap-assisted recombination. In brief, the introduction of DCIB additives contributes to the reduction of trap-assisted combination. In addition, the relationship between the short-circuit current and the intensity of the simulated light source can be fitted by the empirical formula JSC ∝ Iα using the power exponential function.28,29 According to previous reports, the α value is the ideal factor to characterize the degree of bimolecular recombination, and the closer the value of α tends to 1, the weaker bimolecular recombination of the device. From the fitted data in Fig. 3d, the α-value of the DCIB-treated device is 0.994, while the α-value of the untreated device is 0.985. The gradual increase of the α-value indicates that the bimolecular recombination of the device is gradually restrained.
Moreover, to obtain a deeper understanding of the impact of inhibited bimolecular recombination and trap-assisted recombination, we used transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) characterization to analyze the carrier decay kinetics. As shown in Fig. 3e, by fitting with a power exponential ,30 it is found that the carrier lifetime (τ) of the device without additive treatment under open-circuit conditions is 2.53 μs, while in the case of the DCIB-treated device, the carrier lifetime is 2.71 μs. The parameters in this power exponential function are amplitude, time and lifetime, and it is worth noting that the value of amplitude is not affected by time and lifetime. Meanwhile, the carrier extraction rate is calculated by fitting the curve in Fig. 3f with a power exponential function, and it is found that the carrier extraction rate changes from 0.29 μs to 0.20 μs after the introduction of DCIB. The longer carrier lifetime is attributed to the suppression of carrier recombination, which provides a shorter carrier extraction rate at high bias voltages. In other words, the main efficiency improvement of the DCIB-treated devices is the reduction of recombination and the increase of carrier lifetime.
In addition, the carrier mobility before and after DCIB treatment was measured by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method, as shown in Fig. 3g and h. The calculation of mobility relies on the empirical formula , and the individual parameters in the formula can also be found in the previously reported article,31 except for the thickness of the active layer (105 nm). The electron and hole mobilities can be calculated by fitting the empirical formula as 3.50 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 7.32 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (w/o additive devices) and 5.34 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 8.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (10 mg mL−1 additive devices). It is worth noting that both the electron and hole mobilities of the DCIB-treated devices have increased quite a bit in comparison with the untreated devices, thus boosting the JSC and FF of the DCIB-treated OSCs. Moreover, the ratio of hole mobility and electron mobility becomes more balanced after DCIB treatment (μh/μe: 2.08 vs. 1.53; Table S3†), which is beneficial to reduce the space current and improve device performance. These results are fairly consistent with the results of charge extraction and recombination.
2.4. Morphology characterization
To investigate the impact of phase separation morphology under DCIB treatment, we used knockdown mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) to characterize the morphology of the active layer. From Fig. 4a–d, it can be found that there is no obvious change about the value of root-mean-square roughness (Rq) for the device w/o additives and the DCIB-treated device, and both show a smooth surface. However, from the corresponding phase diagrams, it was found that the nano-weave of the active layer is more revealed after the introduction of DCIB, and the phase separation is well-proportioned, which can further supported by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the two films (Fig. S3†). This weave structure of the active layer undoubtedly facilitates carrier transport. It is worth mentioning that the DCIB-treated PM6:Y6 films are smoother than the untreated PM6:Y6 films, which can be directly observed in the photographs of the macroscopic superficial phenomenon captured by a normal mobile phone (Fig. 4e and f). This phenomenon not only matched well with the more well-proportioned morphology of the AFM and TEM results for the DCIB-treated PM6:Y6 films but also indicated the volatilization effect of DCIB as a solid additive for the PM6:Y6 mixed system. The smoother morphology of annealing DCIB-treated PM6:Y6 films illustrated a more ordered molecular arrangement and stronger intermolecular interaction for the PM6:Y6 blended film due to the synergistic effect of TA and the solid additive treatment.17

2.5. Molecular miscibility
Considering that the miscibility of the donor PM6 and the acceptor Y6 is a key factor affecting the carrier transport and device performance, the surface energy of the donor and acceptor under different conditions was investigated. The average water (H2O) contact angles and formamide (FA) contact angles of PM6, DCIB-doped PM6, Y6 and DCIB-doped Y6 were tested, as shown in Fig. S5, Tables 2 and S4.† The water contact angle and formamide contact angle of the pure PM6 films are 106.67° and 82.55°, while they are 106.25° and 85.44° for the DCIB-doped PM6 films, respectively, and their surface energies are 24.78 mJ m−2 and 20.74 mJ m−2, respectively. Meanwhile, the water contact angle and formamide contact angle of the pure Y6 films are 93.28° and 71.16°, while they are 95.35° and 73.00° for the DCIB-doped Y6 films, respectively, and their surface energies are 28.36 mJ m−2 and 27.63 mJ m−2, respectively. Then, we calculated the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter χdonor−acceptor, derived from K (χdonor1/2 − χacceptor1/2)2 for the blends, which can indicate the binary miscibility. PM6:Y6 without DCIB doping has a relatively low χdonor−acceptor value of 12.07 × 10−2 K; on the contrary, the χdonor−acceptor value (49.32 × 10−2 K) is substantially increased by introducing DCIB solid additives into the PM6:Y6 blended system. It may be caused of the very balanced mutual dissolution of the PM6:Y6 blended system that decreased the interference of inhomogeneous molecules and indicated a more ordered molecular arrangement, thus gaining better phase separation morphology and ultimately dramatically enhancing the carrier transport and device performance.15,32

2.6. Performance stability
Residual solid additives have the potential to form trap compound centers, leading to more carrier compounding in the device, which in turn affects the performance and stability of the device.17,18 Therefore, it is very necessary to study the device stability after the introduction of DCIB additives in the PM6:Y6 system. We placed the prepared devices in a glove box for aging test experiments, and the champion device (PCE of 17.02%) was the one at the first measurement. After several tests, it was found that there was a small change of efficiency, and at the 25th day, the PCE of the device retained 95% of the initial efficiency (Fig. 5). Compared with the stability testing of control PM6:Y6 OSCs previously reported by our group,17 the rate of decay and the efficiency value at the same time points are better in the DCIB-treated devices. Moreover, the PM6:Y6-based devices are sensitive to extended thermal treatment, and it is urgent to improve their stability by another strategy or quick post-processing, which are also mentioned by Chen.34 Thus, the solid additive DCIB may be another effective method for improving the stability of PM6:Y6 OSCs.
 Fig. 5  Aging test chart of the DCIB-treated PM6:Y6-based OSCs. 
In addition, we investigated the thermal behavior of the DCIB solid additives. The thermogravimetric (TGA) curve clearly demonstrates that DCIB starts to volatilize and/or decompose below 75 °C (Fig. S5†). From the annealing temperature (110 °C) in our experiment, it can be inferred that the DCIB additive should be evaporated away during the TA process. Indeed, the phase separation morphology of the active layer is metastable, and the donor/acceptor in the mixed system should move spontaneously to a low activation energy state to achieve thermodynamic stability.33 Durable OSC devices must possess strong intermolecular interactions and avoid excessive phase segregation. The DCIB-treated blends possess very strong intermolecular interactions and well-proportioned morphology, which can be obtained by the UV-Vis and miscibility results. The value of χPM6:Y6 (12.07) was lower than that of χPM6:Y6(DCIB) (49.32), suggesting that the presence of DCIB provided a certain buffering effect that prevented excessive segregation in the PM6:Y6 system. Hence, the last PM6:Y6 blended system treated by DCIB and TA process may be without any residual solid additive, which rightly passivates the active layer by strong intermolecular interactions, and thus the DCIB-treated PM6:Y6 OSCs are stable in storage for many days. Simultaneously, the braw phase separation morphology obtained by annealing at 110 °C for 5 and 10 min certainly illustrates the morphology stabilization tendency with the introduction of DCIB and the TA process.34
3. Conclusion
In summary, we introduced a novel simple volatile solid additive 2,6-dichloroiodobenzene (DCIB) in PM6:Y6-based non-fullerene OSCs, which is conducive to morphology optimization and performance stabilization. By reducing recombination and enhancing carrier transport, the DCIB-treated PM6:Y6 OSCs ultimately achieved a PCE of 17.02% and an FF of 75.69%. It is worth noting that the added amount of DCIB is an optimal concentration of 10 mg mL−1, and the final devices maintain their efficiency at 95% of the initial efficiency after 25 days of storage in nitrogen atmosphere. Our work reveals the great potential of volatile solid additives for boosting OSC efficiency and stability and laying a foundation for large-scale OSC exploitation.
