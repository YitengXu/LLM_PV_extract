    , Accepted 8th July 2015First published on 9th July 2015AbstractRecently, power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells has been increased up to about 10% by using solvent additives or mixed solutions to elaborately adjust phase separation which is a great challenge for large scale production. We report a champion PCE of 7.40% for solution-processed small molecule ternary SMPV1:DIB-SQ:PC71BM solar cells by only adjusting the DIB-SQ doping ratio in donors without any treatments on the blend solutions or active layers. The champion PCE of ternary solar cells is larger than the champion PCEs sum (6.98%) of binary solar cells with SMPV1:PC71BM or DIB-SQ:PC71BM as the active layers. The PCE improvement should be attributed to the synergistic enhancement of photon harvesting, exciton dissociation, charge carrier transport and collection by the appropriate DIB-SQ doping ratio in donors. The experimental results on morphology, crystallinity, phase separation and charge carrier mobility of active layers well support the PCE improvement in ternary solar cells with a 10 wt% DIB-SQ doping ratio in donors.
1 Introduction
Solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted significant attention due to their great potential for use as low-cost, lightweight, flexible and environmentally friendly energy-converting devices.1–3 The inspiring power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction OSCs has been rapidly improved up to 10% based on narrow bandgap donor materials.4–6 Synergistic optimizations of photon harvesting and phase separation are the crucial issues for obtaining high performance OSCs, especially for narrow bandgap polymer solar cells. Some strategies have been successfully demonstrated to improve the PCEs of OSCs., such as solvent additive,7 mixed solvent,8,9 methanol treatment,10 and solvent atmosphere treatment on the active layers.11. However, the large scale production of high performance OSCs by using these strategies is a great challenge. It is known that most of the single organic materials have a relatively narrow absorption window (∼100 nm) resulting in the limited photon harvesting range from solar light.12 With the innovation of device physics, stacking two or more subcells with different bandgap donor materials for the preparation of tandem solar cells has been demonstrated as an effective method to improve the photon harvesting range and ability.13–15 The tandem solar cells exhibit about 20%–30% PCE improvement compared with the optimized single-junction subcell.16,17 Meanwhile, tandem solar cells face serious technical challenges in inter-connecting layers between the subcells and the thickness of two or more sub-active layers, which may result in a relatively low yield for potential large-area fabrication.18 The inter-connecting layers should have high charge carrier collection ability and high transmittance. The thickness of the sub-active layer should be balanced to better match the short circuit current (Jsc) of subcells for obtaining the optimized performance of tandem solar cells. Alternatively, ternary solar cells enjoy both the extended light absorption range by incorporating multiple organic materials in tandem solar cells and simplicity of processing conditions used in single-junction OSCs.19–22 According to previous reports, the PCE improvement of ternary solar cells can also reach 20%–30% compared to the champion performance of the corresponding binary solar cells.23–25
For ternary solar cells, the active layers generally contain three kinds of materials: “two donors/one acceptor”18,21,26 or “one donor/two acceptors”27,28 or donor/nonvolatile additive/acceptor.29 For ternary solar cells with two donors, the selection criteria of two donor materials is absorption spectral complementary to increase photon harvesting of the active layers. For ternary solar cells with two acceptors, the selection criterion of two acceptor materials is to form cascade energy levels for better charge carrier transport in the active layers. Until now, most of the ternary solar cells are based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the dominating donor, resulting in a relatively low PCE compared with binary solar cells based on low bandgap materials.12,30 Recently, Yang et al. realized the highest PCE of 8.7% for ternary solar cells by employing two low bandgap polymers with different side chains as donors, which is mainly attributed to the enhanced photon harvesting of ternary active layers.31 Wei et al. selected a small molecule material as the second complementary donor to simultaneously optimize the photon harvesting and phase separation of active layers, achieving a champion PCE of 8.4% increasing from 6.85%.32 In addition to enhancing photon harvesting, exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport can also be optimized by the ternary strategy.25,33,34 It is reasonable to believe that ternary solar cells may be one of the most promising candidates for potential large scale production.
In this work, we present a new solution-processed ternary solar cell with two low bandgap small molecular materials (SMPV1 and 2,4-bis[4-(N,N-diisobutylamino)-2,6-dihydroxyphenyl]squaraine (DIB-SQ)) as donors and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the acceptor. The two dimensional conjugated small molecule SMPV1 has strong self-assembling ability to form an ordered lamellar structure, which is beneficial to charge carrier transport.35 The SMPV1 has a relatively narrow absorption range from 300 to 700 nm, resulting in the limited photon harvesting from the solar light. The linear structure DIB-SQ molecule has a high absorption coefficient and intense absorption in the near-infrared range, while DIB-SQ molecules prefer to form serious molecular aggregation due to the strong molecular interactions, resulting in a discontinuous charge transport pathway in the DIB-SQ:PC71BM blend films.11,36–38 The apparent complementary absorption between SMPV1 and DIB-SQ may be an optimized combination for obtaining high efficiency ternary solar cells. The relatively simple and specific chemical structure of SMPV1 and DIB-SQ may provide a platform to adjust the molecular arrangement for better molecular energy transfer or charge transport in the ternary active layer. Experimental results exhibit that a champion PCE of 7.4% for ternary solar cells was obtained by doping 10 wt% DIB-SQ in donors without any treatments on the blend SMPV1:DIB-SQ:PC71BM solutions or active layers, which is higher than the sum PCE (6.98%) of binary solar cells with SMPV1:PC71BM (5.85%) and DIB-SQ:PC71BM (1.13%) as the active layers.
2 Experimental
Patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass coated substrates (sheet resistance 15 Ω □−1) were cleaned consecutively in ultrasonic baths containing acetone, detergent, de-ionized water and ethanol, respectively. The cleaned ITO substrates were blow-dried by highly pure nitrogen gas and then treated by UV-ozone for 10 minutes in order to further increase the work function of ITO substrates. The poly-(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly-(styrenesulphonicacid) (PEDOT:PSS) (purchased from H.C. Starck co. Ltd.) thin films were fabricated on the cleaned ITO substrates by a spin-coating method at 5000 rounds per minute (RPM) for 40 s, and then annealed at 150 °C for 10 minutes in an air environment. The electron donor materials SMPV1, DIB-SQ and electron acceptor materials PC71BM (purchased from Luminescence Technology Corp and used as received) were dissolved in chloroform to generate 20 mg ml−1 blend solutions. The doping weight ratios of DIB-SQ are 0, 5 wt%, 10 wt%, 15 wt%, 20 wt%, 30 wt%, 50 wt%, and 100 wt% in electron donors (SMPV1 and DIB-SQ) and the weight ratio of donor to acceptor was kept constant as 1:1 (SMPV11−x:DIB-SQx:PC71BM1, x represents DIB-SQ the doping ratio in donors). The blend solutions were spin-coated on PEDOT:PSS films at 900 RPM for 30 s in a high purity nitrogen-filled glove box to fabricate the active layers. The thickness of the active layers is around 90 nm, which is measured with an Ambios Technology XP-2 stylus Profiler. After that, the conjugated polyelectrolyte poly[9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)-propyl-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) was dissolved in methanol to prepare 0.2 mg ml−1 solution with addition of 0.25 vol% acetic acid, and then the PFN solutions were spin-coated on the top of active layers at 3000 RPM for 30 s. An Al (100 nm) film cathode was deposited on the PFN film by thermal evaporation under 10−4 Pa and the thickness was monitored with a quartz crystal microbalance. The active area is about 3.8 mm2, which is defined by the vertical overlap of an ITO anode and Al cathode.
The ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of films were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-3101 PC spectrometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of films were measured using a Perkin-Elmer LS-55 spectrophotometer. Time-resolved transient photoluminescence (TRTPL) spectra were obtained using a FluoroCube-01-NL and FluoroCube-NL from Jobin Yvon. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of all solar cells were measured in an air environment using a Keithley 2400 source meter. AM 1.5 G irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 was provided using an ABET Sun 2000 solar simulator. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of solar cells were measured with a Zolix Solar Cell Scan 100. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of blend films were collected using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer. The morphology of the blend films with different DIB-SQ doping ratios in donors was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) using a multimode Nanoscope IIIa operated in tapping mode. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a JEOL JEM-1400 transmission electron microscope operated at 80 kV.
3 Results and discussion
The chemical structure and absorption spectra of used materials are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The overall donor SMPV11−x:DIB-SQx to PC71BM weight ratio was kept constant as 1:1 for all the active layers, the subscript x represents the DIB-SQ doping ratio in donors. The current J–V curves of all solar cells were measured under AM 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 and are shown in Fig. 1(a). It is apparent that the performances of ternary solar cells has been continuously increased along with DIB-SQ doping ratios up to 10 wt% and then decreased for the further increase of DIB-SQ doping ratios in donors. The detailed photovoltaic parameters of cells are listed in Table 1. The champion PCE of ternary solar cells reaches 7.40% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 11.18 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 72% when the DIB-SQ doping ratio in donors is 10 wt%, as defined as the optimized ternary solar cells. The champion PCE of binary solar cells is 5.85% or 1.13% based on SMPV1:PC71BM or DIB-SQ:PC71BM as the active layers, respectively. It is highlighted that the champion PCE of the optimized ternary solar cells is larger than the sum (6.98%) of the champion PCE of binary solar cells, which has rarely been reported for ternary or tandem solar cells. To confirm PCE improvement by using the ternary strategy, more than two hundred cells were prepared under the same fabrication conditions. The similar phenomenon was observed from the cells prepared from different batches. The Voc of ternary solar cells is kept constant at 0.92 V, which is equal to the Voc of binary solar cells with SMPV1:PC71BM as the active layers. Both Jsc and FF of ternary solar cells show an increasing and then decreasing tendency along with the increase of the DIB-SQ doping ratio in donors. The key photovoltaic parameters dependence on the DIB-SQ doping ratio in donors is described in Fig. S2.† The appropriate DIB-SQ doping ratio in the active layers leads to the simultaneous increase of Jsc and FF, which is attributed to the synergistic enhancement of photon harvesting, exciton dissociation, charge carrier transport and collection.

To gain more insight into the effect of DIB-SQ doping ratios on the performance of cells, the photocurrent density versus effective voltage (Jph–Veff) curves of cells were investigated and are shown in Fig. 1(b). As we know, Jph is defined as the difference between the current density under illumination (JL) and the current density in the dark (JD), thus Jph = JL − JD. Veff is defined as Veff = Vo − Va, where Vo is the voltage at which Jph = 0 and Va is the applied bias voltage.39,40 The J–V curves of all cells in the dark are shown in Fig. S3.† It is apparent that the optimized ternary solar cells exhibit the maximum Jph and rapidly come into a saturation state under a relatively low Veff of about 0.2 V, which suggests that the very efficient processes of exciton dissociation and charge carrier collection have been obtained in the optimized ternary solar cells. For the ternary solar cells with two donors with relatively high DIB-SQ doping ratios or binary solar cells with DIB-SQ as the donor, the Jph shows a strong field dependence across a large bias range and has not fully saturated even at Veff = 2 V, suggesting a significant geminate and/or bimolecular recombination and/or less efficient interfacial contact.41 The loss may result in the decreased FF along with the increase of the DIB-SQ doping ratio in donors. The saturation current density (Jsat) values of SMPV1:PC71BM-based solar cells, the optimized ternary solar cells and DIB-SQ:PC71BM-based solar cells are 10.74 mA cm−2, 12.28 mA cm−2 and 9.10 mA cm−2, respectively, at Veff = 2 V, which are larger than the Jsc values of the corresponding cells. It can be well explained from the better charge carrier transport and collection under the applied bias. It means that the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers in the active layers is inevitable. The efficiency of exciton dissociation and charge carrier collection can be assessed by the Jph/Jsat ratios under short circuit conditions or maximum power output conditions.30,42 The Jph/Jsat ratio under short circuit conditions is 86%, 91% and 49% for SMPV1:PC71BM solar cells, optimized ternary solar cells and DIB-SQ:PC71BM solar cells, respectively, the maximum Jph/Jsat ratio of 91% indicates the highest exciton dissociation efficiency for optimized ternary solar cells. Under the maximum power output conditions, the Jph/Jsat ratio is 72%, 78% and 25% for the corresponding cells, which indicates that the optimized ternary solar cells should have the highest charge carrier collection efficiency and the least charge carrier recombination. In addition, the optimized ternary solar cells have the minimum series resistances (RS = 5.2 Ω cm2) and the maximum shunt resistances (RSH = 1329 Ω cm2) than those of the binary solar cells, indicating that the better contact between the active layer and the electrodes is beneficial to the charge carrier collection for the optimized ternary solar cells.
To further clarify the effect of the DIB-SQ doping ratio on the performance improvement of solar cells, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of all cells were measured and are shown in Fig. 2(a). The calculated Jsc values of SMPV1:PC71BM based cells and the optimized ternary solar cells are 9.21 mA cm−2 and 11.10 mA cm−2 (Fig. S4†), respectively, which are very close to the values obtained from J–V curves, suggesting that the presented experimental results are reliable. As seen from Fig. 2(a), the EQE values of ternary solar cells are markedly increased in the long wavelength range for the DIB-SQ doping ratio up to 15 wt%, which should be attributed to the increase of photon harvesting by DIB-SQ in the ternary active layers. However, the EQE values in this spectral range are clearly decreased for further increase of DIB-SQ doping ratios, suggesting the inefficient exciton dissociation, charge carrier transport and collection although the increase of photon harvesting by DIB-SQ. The absorption spectra of blend films with different DIB-SQ doping ratios were measured and are shown in Fig. 2(b). The apparent red-shift of absorption peaks and enhanced absorption intensity of blend films are observed along with the increase of the DIB-SQ content in the blend films, which is due to the absorption spectral overlap of SMPV1 and DIB-SQ, as well as the relatively high absorption coefficient of DIB-SQ. For the ternary solar cells with DIB-SQ doping ratios less than 15 wt%, the relatively high EQE values in the long wavelength range suggests an efficient hole (generated from exciton dissociation at the DIB-SQ/PC71BM interface) transfer from DIB-SQ to SMPV1 and then transported along the channels formed by SMPV1. However, the efficient hole transport channels formed by SMPV1 will be disrupted along with the increase of DIB-SQ doping ratios, which can be demonstrated from the decreased Jsc and FF of ternary solar cells. Another key phenomenon that should be highlighted is that the slight increase of EQE values in the spectral range from 400 nm to 650 nm is observed for the ternary solar cells with DIB-SQ doping ratios less than 10 wt%. It is known that the increased EQE values in this spectral range mainly correspond to the photoelectric conversion of binary solar cells with SMPV1 as the electron donor. The EQE improvement in this spectral range may be due to the efficient energy or charge carrier transfer from SMPV1 to DIB-SQ, which may provide a new route to increase SMPV1 exciton dissociation efficiency. To clarify dynamic processes between SMPV1 and DIB-SQ, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of neat and blend films were measured and are shown in Fig. 3(a).

The neat SMPV1 films exhibit strong PL emission with an emission peak at 705 nm and neat DIB-SQ films give a rather weak PL emission, which is well in accordance with previous reports.43,44 For the blend films, the SMPV1 emission is markedly quenched, suggesting an efficient energy or charge transfer from SMPV1 to DIB-SQ molecules. The rather weak emission of DIB-SQ films may be due to the strong intermolecular interaction and the self-absorption effect because of the great spectral overlap between its absorption and emission spectra, as shown in Fig. 3(b). To further clarify the dynamic process between SMPV1 and DIB-SQ, PL spectra of neat or blend solutions were measured and are shown in Fig. 3(c). The neat SMPV1 solution exhibits strong emission in a relatively wide PL emission spectral range from 600 nm to 750 nm with an emission peak at 670 nm. The neat DIB-SQ solution also shows strong PL emission in a narrow PL emission spectral range from 660 nm to 690 nm with an emission peak at 680 nm. Meanwhile, the PL emission peaks of SMPV1 and DIB-SQ solutions exhibit an apparent blue-shift compared with that of the corresponding films, indicating the presence of orderly π–π stacking in the films.45 According to the PL spectra of blend solutions, SMPV1 emission in the range from 600 nm to 650 nm is markedly quenched and 680 nm emission intensity is enhanced along with the increase of the DIB-SQ doping ratio in donors. The 680 nm emission intensity of blend solutions is much stronger than that of the neat DIB-SQ solution under the same excitation conditions, suggesting an efficient energy transfer from SMPV1 to DIB-SQ. According to the Förster energy transfer principle,46–48 the spectral overlap between the SMPV1 emission spectrum and the DIB-SQ absorption spectrum is necessary for efficient energy transfer, as shown in the inset image of Fig. 3(d). To further confirm the energy transfer from SMPV1 to DIB-SQ, the time-resolved transient photoluminescence (TRTPL) spectra of blend films are investigated by monitoring 705 nm emission under 460 nm light excitation, as shown in Fig. 3(d). The lifetime of neat SMPV1 films is 0.99 ns and decreased to 0.44 ns for blend films SMPV1:DIB-SQ with a weight ratio of 9:1 and further to 0.33 ns for blend films SMPV1:DIB-SQ with a weight ratio of 1:1. The efficiency (η) of energy transfer can be calculated using the formula49,50  where τ and τDA are the lifetime of the neat SMPV1 film and SMPV1:DIB-SQ blend films, respectively. The energy transfer efficiency can be calculated according to the variation of the lifetime, which is about 56% or 67% for blend films SMPV1:DIB-SQ with a weight ratio of 9:1 or 1:1, respectively. The efficient energy transfer can well explain the increased EQE values in the short wavelength range for the ternary solar cells with a low DIB-SQ doping ratio in donors.
To further clarify the underlying reason for the enhanced EQE values in the short wavelength range, three kinds of planar heterojunction solar cells were fabricated as follows:
Cells A: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/SMPV1/PCBM/Al;
Cells B: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/DIB-SQ/PCBM/Al;
Cells C: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/SMPV1/DIB-SQ/PCBM/Al.
The thickness of the SMPV1 film was prepared by the spin-coating method, DIB-SQ and PCBM films prepared by thermal evaporation is about 40 nm, 20 nm and 20 nm, respectively. The elaborate control of each layer thickness is to investigate the energy or charge transfer between SMPV1 and DIB-SQ due to the limited exciton diffusion distance ∼10 nm.51 The J–V curves of planar heterojunction (PHJ) solar cells are shown in Fig. 4(a). The low performance of PHJ solar cells is mainly attributed to the limited photon harvesting due to the rather thin active layers. The Jsc of Cells C is in between that of Cells A and Cells B, suggesting an inefficient exciton dissociation at the SMPV1/DIB-SQ interface. The detailed information can be obtained from the EQE spectra of the three kinds of cells, as shown in Fig. 4(b). In the short wavelength range from 300 nm to 500 nm, the EQE values are mainly attributed to the contribution of SMPV1 and PCBM, which can be confirmed from the absorption spectra of each material (Fig. 4(b)). The EQE values of Cells C are relatively larger than that of Cells B in this short wavelength range, suggesting the efficient energy transfer from SMPV1 to DIB-SQ and then further exciton dissociation at DIB-SQ/PCBM interfaces. In the long wavelength range from 500 nm to 750 nm (corresponding to the photons with low energy), the EQE values of Cells C are lower than that of Cells B due to the large absorption spectral overlap between SMPV1 and DIB-SQ. The photogenerated excitons in SMPV1 films near the ITO electrode cannot diffuse to the interfaces between SMPV1 and DIB-SQ for energy or charge transfer. Meanwhile, few photons with relatively low energy can reach the DIB-SQ layer due to the strong photon harvesting of SMPV1 when the light is irradiated from the ITO side, resulting in the relatively low EQE values in the long wavelength range. To further investigate the exciton dynamic process at the SMPV1/DIB-SQ interface, a series of cells were fabricated with SMPV1, DIB-SQ or SMPV1:DIB-SQ as the active layer without PC71BM as the electron acceptor. The J–V curves of cells were measured under AM 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2, as shown in Fig. 4(c). The Jsc of SMPV1:DIB-SQ based cells is also rather low, even lower than that of SMPV1 based cells, suggesting that exciton dissociation at SMPV1/DIB-SQ interfaces can be negligible. According to the above discussion, the energy or charge transfer in the active layer can be intuitively described as the processes, as shown in Fig. 4(d). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of SMPV1 and DIB-SQ are similar,44,52 which is beneficial to hole transport among donor molecules. In the ternary active layers, photogenerated excitons in SMPV1 or DIB-SQ can be directly dissociated into free charge carriers assisted by PC71BM. Meanwhile, the photogenerated excitons on SMPV1 can excite DIB-SQ to generate excitons through the Förster energy transfer, as indicted by lightning bolts. The dispersed PC71BM can form continuous electron transport channels, and holes can be transported along the channels mainly formed by SMPV1 molecules in the active layer with a low DIB-SQ doping ratio in donors.

To investigate the effect of DIB-SQ doping ratios in donors on charge carrier transport in the blend films, electron-only devices Al/LiF/active layers/LiF/Al and hole-only devices ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layers/MoO3/Ag were fabricated, and the active layers are the same with those of solar cells. The typical J–V curves of electron-only devices and hole-only devices are shown in Fig. 5. Electron and hole mobility in the ternary active layers with different DIB-SQ doping ratios in donors can be derived by fitting the J–V curves to the space charge limited current (SCLC) model.28,51,53 The electron mobility was decreased from 2.93 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the SMPV1:PC71BM films to 9.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the ternary films with a 10 wt% DIB-SQ doping ratio in donors and then to 1.52 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for DIB-SQ:PC71BM films. The hole mobility was decreased from 1.64 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for SMPV1:PC71BM films to 8.46 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for ternary films with a 10 wt% DIB-SQ doping ratio in donors and then to 7.91 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for DIB-SQ:PC71BM films. The detailed electron and hole mobilities of each kind of active layer are summarized in Table 2. The optimized ratio of electron mobility to hole mobility is about 1.04 for the ternary active layer with a 10 wt% DIB-SQ doping ratio in donors, indicating an efficient bi-continuous interpenetrating network in the ternary active layers. It is known that the more balance of charge carrier mobility is beneficial to photogenerated charge carrier transport in the active layers of solar cells, resulting in a relatively high FF.51 For ternary solar cells with a 10 wt% DIB-SQ doping ratio in donors, electron and hole mobilities arrive to the more balanced state for efficient charge carrier transport and collection in the corresponding cells, which well accords with the high FF of 72% for the optimized ternary solar cells.

It is known that the crystallinity of SMPV1 in the active layers also plays an important role in determining the performance of solar cells. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed to detect SMPV1 crystallinity variations in the blend films with different DIB-SQ doping ratios in donors, as shown in Fig. 6. The detailed information about XRD patterns of blend films are summarized in Table S1.† The neat SMPV1 film exhibits high crystallinity, corresponding to a sharp peak at 2θ = 4.31° and a d100-spacing of 20.49 Å, suggesting a well-ordered lamellar molecular arrangement due to its strong self-assembling ability.35 The reflection intensity of blend films is decreased along with the increase of the DIB-SQ doping ratio in donors, which should be attributed to the decreased domain size of SMPV1 due to the addition of DIB-SQ and the relatively decreased SMPV1 content in the blend films. The domain size of SMPV1 dependence on the DIB-SQ doping ratio in donors was investigated according to the morphology of blend films. It is highlighted that the reflection peak is kept constant at 4.31° and the d100-spacing value is 20.47 Å with a negligible change when the DIB-SQ doping ratio is less than 10 wt%, suggesting that the well-ordered SMPV1 molecular arrangement is still maintained, which is beneficial to charge carrier transport in the blend films. However, the well-ordered SMPV1 molecular arrangement is markedly disrupted along with the increase of the DIB-SQ doping ratio in donors in the blend films, which can be confirmed from the apparent variation of the reflection peak and the corresponding d100-spacing values. The disrupted SMPV1 molecular arrangement will limit the charge carrier transport in the blend films, resulting in the decreased EQE values of ternary solar cells with more DIB-SQ content in the active layers.

It is well-known that a nanoscale phase separation and bicontinuous interpenetrating network in the active layer is vital to efficiently separate the exciton and form percolating channels for charge carrier transport.54 The surface morphology of active layers was characterized by using tapping-mode AFM. The surface topography and phase images of all films are shown in Fig. S5 and S6.† The surface topography images of typical films are shown in Fig. 7. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the surface is about 1.26 nm for SMPV1:PC71BM films (Fig. 7(a)), increased to 3.24 nm for ternary blend films with a 10 wt% DIB-SQ doping ratio in donors (Fig. 7(b)), and then decreased to 0.71 nm for ternary blend films with a 20 wt% DIB-SQ doping ratio in donors (Fig. 7(c)). The RMS roughness of DIB-SQ:PC71BM films is about 0.29 nm (Fig. 7(d)). The homogeneous surface of SMPV1:PC71BM is isolated into some small islands by doping DIB-SQ, resulting in the increased surface roughness and the smaller scale phase separation. An apparent phase separation change can be observed from the phase images, as shown in Fig S7.† As seen from the phase images, the different colour parts can be identified as different components. The fine features of three phase separation can be clearly observed from the ternary blend films with a 10 wt% DIB-SQ doping ratio, which is beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport in the optimized ternary active layer. To obtain further insight into the active layer morphology, TEM images of the films were also measured and are shown in Fig. 7. The bright and dark regions are attributed to electron donor-rich domains and PC71BM-rich domains, respectively.32,55 Electron donor domains always appear brighter in TEM images due to their lower electron density than that of PC71BM. Therefore, the relatively bright regions should be SMPV1 domain (Fig. 7(e)), suggesting a relatively large domain size of SMPV1 for the SMPV1:PC71BM blend films. The large domain size of SMPV1 can effectively support relatively strong reflection intensity at 2θ = 4.31°, as shown in Fig. 6. However, the large domain size of SMPV1 may limit exciton dissociation due to the short exciton diffusion distance. The nanofibril formation was observed from the ternary blend films with a 10 wt% DIB-SQ doping ratio in donors (Fig. 7(f)), the appropriate phase separation extend results in the champion performance of ternary solar cells. For the ternary blend films with a 20 wt% doping ratio in donors, the TEM image (Fig. 7(g)) shows a less characteristic phase separation trend, which cannot well balance the exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport in the blend films. No obvious characteristics can be observed from the TEM image of DIB-SQ:PC71BM films (Fig. 7(h)), the excessive small phase separation (serious molecular aggregation) will limit charge carrier transport in the blend films, resulting in a relatively low PCE of 1.13% for the corresponding cells.

Finally, we further investigated the performance of optimized ternary solar cells with a 10 wt% DIB-SQ doping ratio in donors. The relatively large FF of 72% suggests a small loss of photogenerated charge carriers in the ternary active layers. The J–V curves of the ternary solar cells were measured under light intensities from 3 mW cm−2 to 100 mW cm−2, as shown in Fig. 8(a). According to the power law Jsc dependence on light intensity (J ∝ Iβ), the space charge effect in the cells should be negligible if the β value is close to 1.56 The Jsc dependence on light intensity shows an almost linear relationship as shown in Fig. 8(b). The β value is about 0.97 for the optimized ternary solar cells with a 10 wt% DIB-SQ doping ratio in donors, indicating that photogenerated charge carriers can be effectively swept to individual electrodes with negligible charge carrier recombination, which well accords with the best Jph/Jsat value of optimized ternary solar cells with a 10 wt% DIB-SQ doping ratio in donors under maximum power output conditions.

4 Conclusions
To summarize, we have successfully demonstrated high efficiency ternary solar cells with two small molecules as electron donors and PC71BM as the electron acceptor. The champion PCE of ternary solar cells reaches 7.40%, which corresponds to 26.5% PCE improvement compared with the optimized binary solar cells with SMPV1 as the electron donor. The PCE improvement should be attributed to the synergistic enhancement of photon harvesting, exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport in the ternary active layers with the appropriate DIB-SQ doping ratio in donors. This finding further demonstrates that ternary solar cells may provide an effective and simple method to improve the performance of organic solar cells based on the bulk heterojunction sandwich structure.
