It is a hydrothermal method involving titanium(III) chloride as the only reactant. The resulting one-dimensional rutile nanorods can easily assemble into three-dimensional hierarchical architectures without any surfactants or additives. By selecting appropriate experimental conditions, such as reaction time and ripening temperature, we can easily manipulate the RTM microstructure. Detailed experiments suggest that the growth of the RTM is spontaneous and an extremely rapid self-reaction of titanium(III) chloride, which is controlled by the thermodynamics process. Furthermore, the composites photoanode was fabricated by hybridizing RTM and TiO2 nanoparticles (Degussa-P25 powder) for use in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The composite photoanode-based DSSC possesses superior performance to TiO2 nanoparticle cells. A high light-to-electricity conversion yield of 7.3% for composite photoanodes was achieved, significantly higher than that of TiO2 nanoparticle photoanodes with a similar thickness (5.45%). This result can be attributed to their synergistic effect of high crystallinity, light scattering and fast charge transfer capability.
1. Introduction
Mesocrystals consist of individual nanocrystallines, which are often aligned in a perfect crystallographic way.1–6 Many mesocrystals built from three-dimensional and well-aligned nanocrystallines have been synthesized. For instance, β-NaYF4,7 CaCO3,4 CuSbS2 (ref. 8) and even nanocomposites ZnO–CuO mesocrystals.9 These mesocrystals with potential electronic, optical and magnetic properties have been applied in catalysis, optoelectronics and other devices.10–12 TiO2 has been extensively studied for diverse applications such as lithium ion batteries,13 photocatalysts,14 and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),15 because of its superior physical and chemical properties. For the synthesis of various TiO2 mesocrystals, the method most commonly used to synthesize mesocrystal materials unavoidably requires large amounts of organic solvents or expensive biological additives as morphology-controlling agents.5,16–19 Since these synthesis conditions are complicated and high cost for the production of the desired materials, the lack of a facile method limits the development of TiO2 mesocrystals on a large scale. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop a green and sustainable pathway for the preparation of TiO2 mesocrystals.
Herein, we report an efficient and green approach for the preparation of RTM by using one-step direct hydrothermal treatment of titanium(III) chloride as a precursor. In this work, with the aim of manipulating RTM by adjusting the reaction time and ripening temperature and illustrating the relationship between the microstructure of RTM and its optoelectrical properties.
Recently, a number of studies were reported that the overall efficiency of DSSCs can be significantly increased by improving the light harvesting capacity of the nanostructured TiO2 photoanodes.20–26 Nanoparticle/nanowire composites can possess the advantages of both building blocks, i.e., the high surface area of nanoparticle aggregates and the rapid electron transport rate and the light scattering effect of single-crystalline nanowires. Therefore, the nanoparticle/nanowire composites can represent a very versatile structure. In a previous work, Wu et al. used the composites of anatase TiO2 nanoparticles and single-crystalline anatase TiO2 nanowires as electrodes to fabricate DSSCs, and investigated the effect of the relative nanowire/nanoparticle ratio on the performance of solar cells.22 An enhancement of power efficiency from 6.7% for pure nanoparticle cells to 8.6% for the composite cell with 20 wt% nanowires has been achieved. It is worth noting that that rutile TiO2 possesses superior photochemical/thermal stability and higher refractive index compared with anatase TiO2. Theoretically speaking, as a light scatter, rutile TiO2 will provide better opportunities to achieve superior optoelectrical performance of desired DSSCs. However, little attention has been paid to rutile TiO2 based photoanodes for DSSCs.
Very recently, Zhang et al. reported that 1 μm sized rutile TiO2 nanorod microspheres were fabricated as a scattering overlayer in DSSCs, leading a remarkable improvement in the power conversion efficiency.27 The resulting DSSCs have demonstrated an overall light conversion efficiency of 8.22% (bilayer photoanodes), significantly higher than that of a nanoparticle-based DSSC photoanodes with similar thickness (7.00%). Wang et al. developed a new type of one-dimensional crystalline rutile TiO2 nanorod based photoanodes by using a two-step hydrothermal process.28 The bilayer-structured photoanode possesses oriented rutile nanorod arrays directly growing on a FTO substrate as the bottom layer and a radially packed rutile head-cap as the top layer. The resultant new structures delivered a light-to-electricity conversion efficiency of 6.31% as photoanodes in DSSCs. These encouraging results suggest that high performance DSSCs can be constructed using rutile TiO2 based photoanodes with suitable structure.
In this work, we establish a composites photoanode composed of rutile TiO2 mesocrystalline and nanoparticle (Scheme 1), and their photoelectric performance was evaluated. The composites of P25 and rutile TiO2 mesocrystals showed a higher conversion efficiency of 7.3% and a short circuit current density of 15.21 mA cm−2 compared to P25. Several differences of our strategy from other studies are noteworthy: (1) the whole reaction process was accomplished by a one-pot hydrothermal reaction. (2) The process avoided using expensive solvents or additives. (3) The good binding of P25 nanoparticles and microspheres and the superior light scattering performance of microspheres allow us for the first time to explore cell performance. Conventionally, the double structure of light scattering layer and nanoparticles was employed, in this work, we provide an mixture structure to overcome such limitations. In this work, our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of this structure to obtain high-performance solar cells.

2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials synthesis
In a typical synthesis, 40 ml of titanium(III) chloride (solution about 15% in about 10% hydrochloric acid, for synthesis) was added to a Teflon-lined autoclave; titanium(III) chloride was kept at 180 °C for 12 in an oven. After completion of the reaction, the clear solution at the upper section was carefully removed and a precipitate (TiO2 product) formed at the bottom of the Teflon reactor. The solid products obtained were washed 3–4 times with deionized water and then dried at 100 °C for further characterization. To investigate the formed RTM mechanism, the other temperature, such as 120, 150 °C and reaction time, such as 3, 6, 9 and 24 h was performed.
2.2 Material characterizations
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis with a PANanalytic X'Pert diffractometer (XRD, using Cu Kα radiation, λ = 0.15405 nm) was performed to determine the crystal structure. The surface morphologies of the samples were observed on field-emission scanning electron microscope (JEOL JSM-7000F, Japan). The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained with a JEOL JEM-2010F microscopy operating at 200 kV. The UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-3101PC UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer operating in the diffuse mode with application of the Kubelka–Munk equation. Electron impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of the DSSC were characterized by an electrochemical workstation (CHI760C, CH Instruments) with a 5 mV AC signal over the frequency range of 10−2 to 105 Hz under 100 mW cm−2 white illumination. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSC were tested by a solar simulator (Newport-Oriel 91192, 100 mW cm−2) equipped with a digital source meter (Keithley, 2400). The dye loading amount was measured by immersing the sensitized photoanodes into 10 mM KOH solution for 30 min to desorb and completely deprotonate the dye. The loading amount of the resulting solutions can be determined by the absorbance of solutions with respect to the calibration solutions under UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3101PC UV-vis-NIR).
2.3 Photoanode preparation and DSSC assembly
The as-synthesized samples were immersed in a 0.05 M titanium tetrachloride aqueous solution at 70 °C for 1 h, then rinsed in deionized water and annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. For the dye absorption, they were immersed in a 1:1 volume ratio solution of ethanol and acetonitrile containing 5 × 10−4 M ruthenium bipyridyl dye (N719 dye, Solaronix). A Pt precursor and a solution of 5 × 10−3 M hexachloroplatinic acid in isopropanol was deposited onto FTO glass by the spin coating process. Then, the platinized electrodes were obtained by thermal decomposition of hexachloroplatinic acid at 380 °C for 20 min. Cells were fabricated with 30 μm thick surlyn film (Dupont) as a spacer between the photoanodes and counter electrodes. The electrolyte containing 0.6 M 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (PMII), 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 0.03 M I2, and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15) was finally introduced into the DSSCs by a vacuum filling method. The active area of the cell is 0.159 cm2.
3. Results and discussion
Fig. 1a–c shows typical FESEM images of the as-synthesized samples. As revealed by FESEM images, the products were composed of micro-scale spheres of 2–3 μm in diameter. Obviously, a surface crack is clearly observed on the surface of microspheres (yellow mark), which was extended to the microsphere center (white mark). Further, a higher magnification FESEM image indicated that these microspheres were composed of smaller subunit that resembles rod architecture which grew from a common center region (Fig. S1†). The red mark shows that the internal constitution of microspheres exhibited some cavities. According to the operating principles of DSSCs, these structure features provide the opportunity to the diffusion of liquid electrolyte and to amount of adsorption sites for dye molecular. How to obtain and to manipulate these structures will be discussed in the latter section. Fig. 1d shows the XRD pattern of the sample shown in Fig. 1a. All of the reflections match well with the rutile TiO2 standard pattern (JCPDS89-4920), and the sharp peaks are indicative of high crystallinity. All these evidences indicate that the as-obtained products are RTM. To further reveal the RTM structure, detailed TEM and HRTEM measurements were carried out.

Fig. 2 shows the TEM and HRTEM images of the mesocrystals after a long ultrasonic process. Some individual mesocrystals are observed in the inset of Fig. 2a. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, the side sections of this mesocrystal shows an obvious radiated growth of nanorods, which agree with Fig. 1a–c. A HRTEM image of an individual nanorod structure and its corresponding SAED pattern was shown in Fig. 2c and d, respectively. The HRTEM image revealed a (110) interplane distance of 0.325 nm, indicating the nanorod was formed by growing along the (110) crystal plane with a preferred [001] orientation in Fig. 2c. The SAED pattern confirms that all the nanorod crystals are single crystals having similar preferential orientation along the [001] direction. These typical structure features are also consisted with previously reported literature.27,28

To better understand the formation process of RTM, the as-synthesized samples with different hydrothermal reaction times were analysed by FESEM. The changes in the centre of microspheres are the key information to understand the formation process of RTM. Therefore, it must be careful to characterize the changes in morphology during the different reactions stages. Unexpectedly, these RTM can be rapidly formed even at the short time, 10 min, and low temperature, 90 °C, as shown in Fig. S2 and S3.† To our best knowledge, the RTM formation is rarely reported at such a low temperature and short time. Thus we can reasonably infer that the nuclei and growth of TiO2 nanocrystals is fairly rapid. We continually explored the case at 90 °C for 1 min again, but hit the same obstacles again and again with the same result. Unfortunately, however, we could not achieve any encouraging results about the center formation process. We admitted that the nucleation and growth mechanisms of RTM center behind the simple chemistry that is extremely complicated. It should be emphasized that our understanding of these structures is far from being able to present atomistic or molecular details for the evolution pathways that a precursor compound may take to form TiO2 nanocrystals, nuclei, and then well-defined RTM. After a large amount of preliminary experiments, we selected a relative low hydrothermal reaction temperature. The reason of the selected temperature in our time-dependent experiments will be further addressed in Fig. 4. As shown in Fig. 3a, the as-obtained sample at 3 h is large scale and uniform microsphere. The diameter of each microsphere is about 2–3 μm. When the reaction time is extended to 6 h, 9 h, the appearance of these micro-scale microspheres is nearly unchanged (Fig. 3b–d). Surprisingly, even the time is increased to 24 h, the appearance and the diameter of the microsphere is similar to other reaction time, for example, 3 h, 6 h and 9 h. It can be inferred that the reaction is rapid and insensitive to the time under this temperature. Unfortunately, compared to the time-dependent evolution methods of other previous literature,25,27 we are unable to obtain some valuable information about the formation process of RTM. However, it may give us other extra thoughts. An important question arises as to whether these reactions are mainly controlled by the thermal dynamic process other than the growth kinetics.

Furthermore, to confirm our assumption, we selected three different temperatures to address this issue, as shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4a shows that the microstructure of as-prepared products. It is found that the large amount of irregular geometrical bulk was randomly distributed at 120 °C (Fig. 4a). Some microspheres were also found in the as-prepared products and their diameter is similar to other samples at different temperature, as shown in Fig. 4b. Compared to the as-prepared products under 150 °C and 180 °C, the appearance and the diameter of the other two samples is nearly the same in dimension. We found that the surface crack of the samples under 180 °C can be clearly observed, as shown in Fig. 4d. Surprisingly, almost each microspheres exhibited surface cracks. As Fig. 1 described that the surface crack of RTM is very important for liquid electrolyte diffusion and dye molecular adsorption, therefore, this also gives us some inspiration whether we can control this formation of these cracks. What's the formation mechanism of surface cracks? We will obtain some interesting method to design the proper structure for DSSCs application if we know the reason behind this phenomenon. Compared to three different temperatures, we inferred that the relative high temperature will lead to the increased crystalline size. What's more, the surface crack may be caused by relative high temperature.
To confirm our assumption, the temperature-dependent experiments were carried out. XRD and FESEM, as two powerful tools, are used to address the question mentioned above. XRD characterization of the three samples mentioned above is shown in Fig. 5. It can be found that the primary crystallite size became larger (from 5.6 to 7.5 nm) as estimated from line (110) or from 12.4 to 16.1 nm as estimated from line (101). The increased scale is not larger, however, the force due to the stress induced by the increased crystalline size will lead to the destroy of this equilibrium. In this process, the temperature plays a role in two aspects: one is the regulation of the morphology adjustment from irregular spheres to regular spheres; the other is the formation of a surface crack of spheres. Although most of the previous literature reported similar morphology of RTM, we obtained different experimental results from previous literature reports,27,28 which may be due to our unique synthesis route. Importantly, we found that the reaction temperature in our case plays a very important role.

For many years, much research has focused on the direct growth of nanoarrays on FTO substrate.15,20–23,25–28 Interestingly, when the FTO substrate is inserted into our proposed reaction system, large scale rutile TiO2 nanoarrays were formed at the face of conductive section without the formation of microspheres, as shown in Fig. S4.† Therefore, the proposed method may provide new opportunity and a new insight for the direct fabrication of rutile TiO2 nanorod arrays on the FTO substrate, which is of practical significance since it is novel, environmentally benign synthetic strategy using single source.
Based on the experimental results mentioned above, a possible growth mechanism was proposed as illustrated in Scheme 2. TiCl3 solution is protected by HCl so as to prevent it from hydrolysis. It should be noted that the stability of TiCl3 is good at room temperature under the absence of air. When exposed to air, the TiCl3 often resulted in reductive coupling reactions. For our case, the TiCl3 reacts with oxygen in the relatively high temperature. These formed TiO2 solids then condense and nucleate in the form of TiO2 nucleation. What's the accurate reaction equation of how TiCl3 was transformed into rutile TiO2? To date, it is still unknown. Sophie Cassaignon et al. found that TiCl3 can be easily transformed into rutile TiO2 by mixing phenomena of precipitation and oxidation.29 The proposed mechanism by Sophie Cassaignon also explained why the variation of titanium valence state occurred. In this process, the temperature is just like a trigger and destroys the equilibrium of immiscible liquid microenviroment systems of TiCl3. We speculate that, since the H+ and Cl− could promote the formation of TiO2 nanowire, both of which could surrounded the TiO2 nucleation even if the TiCl3 was transformed to TiO2 nanocrystallines. With the reaction proceeds, the nanorod cluster began to form due to the assistant of Cl−. Many TiO2 nanorod clusters are joined to each other and form the mesocrystalline microspheres due to the lowest energy principle. The growth mechanism of the rutile TiO2 nanorod had been well summarized in previous reported literature. It should be noted that the acid used in this case is only from the little protective acid environmental system that is different from its traditional growth environment. Cl− is only from itself and HCl, which finally lead to the formation of rutile TiO2 nanorods. While, other synthesis condition often required a large amount of HCl.30–32 In the substrate case, we can assume that the repulsion of each neighbour nanorod clusters will lead to the formation of nanorod arrays. In this case, the F-doped SnO2 provided the energetically favored nucleation sites for the further adsorption of incoming species as the reaction proceeds.

To investigate the light scattering properties of the RTM in the DSSCs, the mechanical mixture of the P25 and RTM was used as photoanode. The RTM was annealed at 500 °C for 30 min when it was used in the DSSCs. The microstructure and crystals phase of RTM remained approximately unchanged except for the increased crystallinity degree, as show in Fig. S5.† The cross-sectional FESEM image of the as-prepared thin film is shown in Fig. 6. The FESEM images of a RTM composites thin film show that the surface of the film is smooth, and the thickness of the composites film is ca. 14 μm. For comparison, P25 thin film with the same thickness is also be fabricated.

UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the three bare TiO2 films are shown in Fig. 7, which reflect their different light scattering capacities. Comparatively, the P25 + mesocrystals composites layer exhibit higher diffuse reflectance in the visible range of 400–800 nm in the wavelength range from 300–1100 nm (Fig. 7a). Surprisingly, the extremely simple method give rise to unique mesocrystals structure and unexpectedly excellent diffused performance. This structure is highly beneficial for light scattering application in DSSCs. In addition, the light adsorption capacity of composites thin film is also higher than that of the P25 thin film (Fig. 7b). This is understandable since RTM with superior diffused performance is introduced into the P25 thin film and a part of the reflected light from RTM is absorbed by P25 thin film, thus leading to the reflectance of the composites thin film (Scheme 1) in the middle of RTM and P25. While the transmittance of the composites thin film is also lower than the P25 thin film (Fig. S6†). Hence, such a composites thin film with relative high light absorption and low transmittance would maximize the use of light in the range of 400–800 nm, and thus would enhance the photon to electricity conversion efficiency. It should be noted that the reflectance of composites thin film is lower than that of RTM, however, it is still significant due to the good integration of P25 and RTM, which will be demonstrated by the comparison of the photovoltaics performance of P25, RTM and P25 + RTM composites thin film and will be discussed in greater detail later.

Fig. 8 shows the current density–voltage characteristics of the DSSCs fabricated using three samples: RTM, P25 and P25 + mesocrystals composites thin film. The values of open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and conversion efficiency (η), which were obtained from Fig. 8, were shown in Table 1. The best performance was achieved for DSSCs using composites thin film. The photovoltaic parameters give a short-circuit current density of 15.21 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage of 0.68 V and a fill factor of 0.7, corresponding to an overall photoelectron conversion efficiency of 7.3% under one sun intensity. The efficiency of the P25 is only 5.45%. According to the Lambert–Beer law, the molar concentration of dye unloading from P25 + mesocrystals composites, P25, and RTM is 4.15, 4.77, and 3.60 × 10−7 mol cm−2, respectively. It's well-known that the amount of adsorbed dye molecules is a very important factor which enhances the conversion efficiency. Generally speaking, the larger adsorbed dye amount, the higher the conversion efficiency. Therefore, it's inferred that the great enhancement of photovoltaics of composites film is mainly due to the superior light scattering properties rather than the photovoltaics performance of the REM itself. Actually, the photoelectric conversion efficiency of RTM is only 1.23%. The results have demonstrated that the application of one-step method in the fabrication of RTM is useful especially for light scattering materials.

Fig. 9a shows the Bode phase plots of EIS spectra for the two types of DSSCs. Based on the low frequency peak value (fmax), the electron lifetime for recombination (τe) for the two DSSCs are calculated according to the follow equation.33,34τe = ωmin−1 = (2πfmax)−1

The equivalent circuit used to fit the experimental data was shown in the inset. Dots represent the experimental data, and the dotted line represents the fitted curve. 
The fmax and τe values for the two DSSCs are summarized in Table 2. Compared to the DSSCs based on P25 thin film, the DSSC based on the composites film shows the lowest value of fmax (25.7 Hz) and the longest electron lifetime (1.34 ms) for recombination. Fig. 9b shows the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of P25 only and composites thin film based DSSCs, respectively. There are two sets of semicircles; each set starts from total series resistance, followed by a small semicircle (the span, R1) at high frequency, and then a large semicircle (the span, R2) at low frequency. According to the EIS model reported in the literature,33,34 R1 is ascribed to the charge-transfer resistance at the Pt counter electrode/electrolyte interface and R2 is related to the electron transport resistance within the TiO2 layer and across the TiO2/electrolyte interface. The fitted parameters including R1 and R2 obtained by ZSimpWin software are listed in Table 2.

As shown in Table 2, the P25 + mesocrystals scattering layer shows a lower Rs (sheet resistance) value than the P25-based DSSC, which can be ascribed to the strong attachment of the P25 + mesocrystals composites layer to the FTO glass. The composites-based DSSC also shows the lower R2 value among the two DSSCs. The reason is that the composites photoanode overcomes some shortages of the P25 thin film electrodes. The mesocrystals structure with the nanorods clusters may accelerate the electron transfer between TiO2/electrolyte interface. This factor contributes to a small resistance.
Additionally, in the composites photoanode, the RTM provides more electron pathways from the mesocrystals to the P25 and subsequently enhances the electron transfer efficiency (Scheme 1). Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the composite DSSC has the lowest R2 value among the two DSSCs. In summary, the lowest resistance for electron transport and the longest electron lifetime for recombination could favor the highest charge collection rate of photogenerated electrons, which enhances the efficiency of the DSSCs based on the composites film. It should be emphasized that the mixture structure of RTM with strong light scattering properties and P25 provides a promising strategy for enhancing the overall performance of DSSCs, compared with the traditional bilayer structure model.20–26
4. Conclusions
In summary, we found that rutile TiO2 mesocrystals composed of nanorod cluster were successfully synthesized involving TiCl3 as the only reactant. This extremely rapid self-reaction of TiCl3, which results from the synergetic effect of both H+ and Cl−. A possible growth mechanism for the rutile mesocrystals based on the combined analysis of XRD, HRTEM and FESEM is revealed, and their superior light scattering properties were studied for use in DSSCs. The optoelectronic performance investigation of this light scattering material revealed that the unique rutile TiO2 mesocrystals exhibited an enhanced DSSCs performance compared to that of P25. The composites of P25 and rutile TiO2 mesocrystals showed a higher conversion efficiency of 7.3% and a short circuit current density of 15.21 mA cm−2 compared to P25. A great increase in cell efficiency was achieved by employing the mesocrystals as a result of their strong light scattering properties and fast charge transform ability. The highly improved optoelectronic properties of the DSSCs may be ascribed to the unique hierarchical structure of the rutile TiO2 mesocrystals. Our work demonstrates that rutile TiO2 mesocrystals can realize high-performance DSSCs when applied as hybrid composites layer.
