    , Accepted 22nd January 2018First published on 22nd January 2018AbstractThe substitution of Ge4+ for Sn4+ in Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) kesterite-type absorber layers for thin film solar cells has been proven to enhance the opto-electronic properties of the material. By cationic substitution, in general, the optical bandgap can be more readily designed for the purpose of bandgap engineering, and the substitution of Sn4+ by Ge4+, in particular, widens the optical bandgap such that it can be employed for both photovoltaics and solar fuel quarrying by photocatalytic water splitting. This work is an experimental study of intrinsic point defects in off-stoichiometric kesterite-type Cu2ZnGeSe4 (CZGSe) by means of neutron powder diffraction. We revealed the existence of copper vacancies (VCu), various cation antisite defects (CuZn, ZnCu, ZnGe, CuGe) as well as interstitials (Cui, Zni) in a wide range of off-stoichiometric polycrystalline materials synthesized by solid state reaction. In addition to the off-stoichiometry-type specific defects, Cu/Zn disorder is always present in the kesterite-type CZGSe phase. While compositional changes are clearly reflected by the tetragonal deformation c/2a, the lattice parameters a and c seem differently responding to point defect types and concentration variations, respectively. The CuGe antisite defect which is known to greatly deteriorate the opto-electronic properties exists only in Cu-rich CZGSe, but appears already in CZGSe with Cu/(Zn + Ge) ≈ 1. Furthermore, we showed by diffuse reflectance hyperspectral imaging a widening of the energy bandgap in off-stoichiometric kesterite-type CZGSe with decreasing Cu/(Zn + Ge).
Introduction
Since the late 1970s,1 quaternary chalcogenides like Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 kesterite-type compounds have been known to be intrinsic semiconductors possessing a direct optical bandgap suitable for use as solar energy converters. However, ternary chalcopyrite-type compounds have been one of the first chalcogenide materials to be considered as absorber layers in 2nd generation solar cells based on thin film technology,2 likely due to lower complexity in terms of phase relations and structural properties. And yet, kesterite-type compounds started to be increasingly studied as absorber layers in thin film solar cells3,4 and more efforts were put into improving power conversion efficiencies which, so far, culminates in 12.6% record efficiency.5 In spite of the still superior performance of thin film solar cells based on chalcopyrite-type absorbers, it has been realized that upscaling from the laboratory process to GW production (and beyond) might be not feasible as the deployment of the trivalent cations In3+ and Ga3+ in AIBIIIXVI26 chalcopyrite-type compound semiconductors is expected to cause future shortage and, correspondingly, goes along with a high risk of cost increase. So for the purpose of upscaling, the barrier of availability has to be overcome by considering materials consisting of abundant elements. With AI2BIICIVXVI4 kesterite-type compound semiconductors, the possibility is more likely given for large-scale production of potentially low-cost and high-efficiency solar cells. However, one has to be aware of the fact that substituting Sn4+ for Ge4+, of course, does counteract the philosophy of avoiding deployment of rather rare elements. Nevertheless, it was demonstrated that CZTSe absorber layers doped with Ge show improved VOC along with enhanced grain growth7 as well as improved voltage-dependent charge carrier collection.8 Ultimately, the exploitation of solar energy for photovoltaics as well as solar fuel production also features a promising future prospect.
Kesterite-type materials belong to the adamantine compound family9 and crystallize in the tetragonal crystal system with a body-centered unit cell and a four-fold rotational inversion along the c-axis, resulting in space group I.10–12 In the kesterite-type structure, five Wyckoff positions are occupied. The 2a and 2c positions are occupied by a univalent cation (e.g. Cu+) while a divalent cation (e.g. Zn2+) is accommodated by the 2d position, and a tetravalent cation (e.g. Sn4+, Ge4+) occupies the 2b position. Because of this cationic arrangement, the anion located at the 8g position is shifted off the centre of the cation tetrahedron (Fig. 1a). The aforementioned cation positions, though, only hold for perfectly ordered kesterite, where the 2c and 2d positions at z = 0.25 and z = 0.75 would be fully occupied by copper and zinc, respectively. The kesterite-type semiconductors Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2ZnSnSe4, however, exhibit an order–disorder transition13 at critical temperature Tc. Above the critical temperature, the crystal can be described to be in dynamic equilibrium, with copper and zinc being readily interchanged since energy differences between 2c and 2d sites are small.13,14 As temperature falls below Tc, copper and zinc start to order on their respective positions. Therefore, disorder decreases with decreasing temperature and tends to approach the completely ordered state if temperature is sufficiently low and equilibration time (i.e. cooling rate) is sufficiently long. This, however, is normally not realized since equilibration times are usually well below of what would be required,15 and it has been demonstrated that the Cu/Zn disorder in CZTSe is influenced by the extent as well as the direction of off-stoichiometry.16 Hence, kesterite-type materials are considered to always show a certain amount of Cu/Zn disorder16 (Fig. 1b) which is supposed to be an essential source for bandgap fluctuation17,18 and, eventually, contributes to the VOC deficit19,20 of kesterite-based solar cells.

Most chalcogenide materials exhibit p-type conductivity while, for instance, Ag2ZnSn(S,Se)4 is known to show n-type conductivity.21 One advantage of chalcogenides in general, and particularly of kesterite-type compounds, is the high chemical variability allowing for ready adjustment of the bandgap energy. This flexibility in designing the bandgap energy is of great benefit for optimizing band alignments at heterojunction interfaces and minimizing recombination in the solar cells through chemical gradients.22 Another advantage linked to this issue is the possibility to harvest sunlight not only for the purpose of photovoltaics but also for hydrogen production by photocatalytic water splitting. While 1.23 eV is the minimum energy required for water splitting, it has been reported that bandgap energies around 2 eV turned out to provide the best energy conversion and highest quantum efficiencies.23
In the solid solution, CZTSe–CZTS cationic substitution of Sn4+ for Ge4+ widens the bandgap energy from about 1.0 (CZTSe)–1.5 (CZTS) eV24 to about 1.5 (CZGSe)–2.2 (CZGS) eV,25 respectively. Hence, this range of higher bandgap energies is more suitable in terms of solar energy conversion into chemical energy (i.e. hydrogen production) whilst being less capable of reaching the highest photovoltaic performance. For photovoltaic applications, eventually, the best performing solar cells could be achieved with an optical bandgap energy of 1.34 eV26 according to the Shockley–Queisser limit, and by using off-stoichiometric kesterite-type absorbers, in which the overall composition of the films is Cu-poor and Zn-rich.27,28 The deviation from stoichiometry has been systematized according to certain cation substitution processes forming defect complexes. Considering the possible cation substitution reactions maintaining charge balance, 12 different off-stoichiometry types (A–L) can be established.16,29–31 Details on the off-stoichiometry types are summarized in Table 1. The structural representation of the corresponding intrinsic point defects is shown in Fig. 2.

For better visibility, four unit cells are shown and anions have been excluded (extended and modified after30). 
The main objective of this study is the identification of point defect types and their correlation with the off-stoichiometric composition in CZGSe. The basis for this systematic investigation are off-stoichiometric CZGSe powder samples which have been synthesized by solid state reaction according to A-, B-, C- and D-type composition.29
Experimental
The CZGSe powder samples have been synthesized by solid state reaction using the elements copper, zinc, germanium and selenium with high purity (≥99.999%). Details on the synthesis route and reaction steps can be found in ref. 30. The elements were accurately balanced to within one milligram to form quaternary compounds with A-, B-, C- and D-type composition (cf.Fig. 2 and Table 1). In order to facilitate the entire reaction of the metal pieces, about 2% excess selenium was added. Additionally, in most of the synthesis runs, the germanium metal pieces have been pre-ground since germanium turned out to be not fully reacted after the first synthesis step. The temperature program applied to the as-weighed samples has been adapted specifically for the substitution of Sn by Ge and is described in Table 2. Irrespective of the homogenization step, Cu-rich, Zn-poor, Ge-rich C-type samples were strongly prone to form several kesterite phases and therefore required an additional homogenization step, that is, repetition of the second reaction step.

After the homogenization step, the samples were ground to fine powder, which is required for the characterization techniques to be applied subsequently. The composition of 30 synthesized CZGSe powder samples has quantitatively been determined by means of a JEOL-JXA 8200 electron probe micro-analyzer (EPMA) using wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (WDX) being calibrated with element standards. Line scans, each with 10 measurement spots, on numerous grains were averaged to ensure acquisition of statistically robust information on composition and homogeneity (see ESI† Fig. S1). A sample consisting of several kesterite-type phases is not suitable for in-depth structural studies by X-ray and neutron diffraction. Specifically in the case of neutron diffraction, from which the site occupancy factors will eventually be derived, an accurate data analysis would not be possible.
Following the homogenization steps, the samples have been characterized by powder X-ray and neutron diffraction. X-ray powder diffraction data was recorded over a 2θ range of 10–140° with a step size of 0.01313° by means of a PANalytical X'Pert MPD diffractometer (λCu-Kα = 1.54187 Å) using a Bragg–Brentano set-up and a rotatable sample stage. However, only basic structural information (e.g. lattice parameters) and quantitative phase content can be extracted since the scattering powers (atomic form factor) of the isoelectronic cations Cu+, Zn2+ and Ge4+ are too similar to be distinguished, making differentiation of these cations by conventional X-ray diffraction impossible. Therefore, additional neutron diffraction experiments were conducted using the fine resolution powder diffractometer E9 (λ = 1.79820 Å)32 at the BER II research reactor. The neutron diffraction patterns were collected from 15° to 140° 2θ with a step size of 0.075°. Eventually, the obtained diffraction patterns from both X-ray and neutron diffraction, respectively, were analyzed using the Rietveld method33,34 implemented in the FullProf Suite software package.35 As a starting model for the Rietveld refinements, the kesterite-type structure (s.g. I)10–12 has been included. For the description of the peak shape profile, the Thompson–Cox–Hastings pseudo-Voigt function36 was employed, and instrumental resolution functions have been put into the refinement in order to provide more stable computation of the profile parameters.
Diffuse reflectance measurements have been performed with a hyperspectral imaging setup with a CCD camera (Allied Vision Pike F-145) coupled with a liquid crystal tunable filter (Kurios-XE2). A halogen lamp was used to illuminate the CZGSe powders. The hyperspectral stack obtained from the powders was divided over the one obtained from measuring a Spectralon SRM-99 standard to calculate the diffuse reflectance spectra.
Results and discussion
In every sample, kesterite-type CZGSe was found to be the main phase. The atomic percentages of the elemental constituents obtained from quantitative electron probe micro-analysis spread in the cation ratio plot show that most of the kesterite-type CZGSe can be foreseen as a mixture of two off-stoichiometry types (Fig. 3). In addition to the kesterite-type phase, the presence of secondary phases in most of the samples was detected. By the combined inspection of the EPMA, XRD and ND data, seven samples could be identified as single-phase, at least within the detection limit of the techniques used in this study. Single-phase samples, which contain only a kesterite-type CZGSe phase, were found mainly around the F-type line as well as between the F- and I-type and close to K-type composition. ZnSe has been identified in all the samples with the exception of the single-phase powders and one powder containing only Ge as the secondary phase. ZnSe along with Ge and Zn was only found in one A–B-type sample being the most Cu-poor. Likewisely far off-stoichiometric B–G-type samples exhibit small amounts of Cu–Zn alloys (Fig. 3).

Solid lines indicate the course of the off-stoichiometry types A–L. Differently shaped and colored symbols indicate the phase content found using the various analysis techniques (i.e. EPMA, XRD, ND). Off-stoichiometry types not involved in this study are represented by the shaded area. 
Even though the samples were weighed-in according to A-, B-, C- and D-type progressing from the stoichiometric point Zn/Ge = Cu/(Zn + Ge) = 1 towards higher off-stoichiometries along the respective type line, the final composition was fairly systematically shifted, which led to mixtures between off-stoichiometry types. This compositional shift is mainly due to the loss in Ge during the synthesis. In fact, Ge–Se binaries were found to be deposited on the internal side of the glass ampoules, and with the exception of one sample, all other samples experienced depletion in Ge (Fig. 4a). Remarkably, the deficit in Ge at its as-weighed stoichiometric coefficient νGe = 1.00, which concerns 20 out of 30 samples, shows very similar values around 10 mol%, and two samples intended to have 0.9 moles of Ge were virtually not subject to Ge loss (Fig. 4a). Another striking feature is the relative overall enrichment in Cu, following quite the same trend as Ge does. Zn, on the other hand, rather exhibits an opposing trend. In Fig. 4b, the remaining νGe is shown, that is, when subtracting the Ge deficit from as-weighed νGe. Apparently, for the given synthesis route, only about 90 mol% Ge is incorporated (Fig. 4b), regardless of the initial amount of Ge. These observations suggest that for the future development of Ge-containing kesterite-type compounds, either thin films or powders, the control of the final composition is a challenging task. Further studies using different synthesis approaches and conditions should help in understanding the Ge loss mechanism and its correlations to the structural and opto-electronic properties of the samples synthesized.

In order to determine the sum formula of each off-stoichiometric CZGSe phase, the respective type fractions as well as the non-stoichiometric variables (i.e. a–l, cf.Table 1) have to be calculated beforehand. The non-stoichiometric variables given in the general sum formulae are calculated by forming linear equations equating known cation ratios with the corresponding stoichiometric coefficient, and are solved for the non-stoichiometric variable (see the ESI,† eqn (S1)–(S6)). Knowing both the type fraction and the non-stoichiometric variable allows for the calculation of the stoichiometric coefficients of each cation, finally yielding the actual sum formula accounting for occurring point defects while maintaining the charge balance.
The lattice parameters of the phases as well as quantitative phase content were obtained from Rietveld analysis33,34 of the XRD data (see ESI† Fig. S2). In the Cu-poor region, the lattice parameter a remains rather unchanged while the lattice parameter c steadily increases towards the stoichiometric point Cu/(Zn + Ge) = 1. Beyond that stoichiometric point, a reverse behavior is observed with lattice parameter a decreasing, whereas c turns into a plateau (Fig. 5a) which, to some extent, is comparable with the observations reported for off-stoichiometric Cu2ZnSnSe4 powder samples.30 The unit cell volume Vuc thus increases quite linearly from Cu-poor conditions towards the stoichiometric point, culminates under slightly Cu-rich conditions at Cu/(Zn + Ge) ≈ 1.05, and decreases linearly again towards the Cu-rich direction (see ESI† Fig. S3). The tetragonal deformation η = c/2a, thus, continuously decreases, that is, approaching unity, from the most Cu-poor to the most Cu-rich composition (Fig. 5a and b). Similar observations have been reported for CZTSe thin films when compared to the overall composition of the samples. The enhancement of the tetragonal deformation has been associated with an increase of the bandgap of the material and subsequently to an increase of the open circuit voltage (VOC) of the solar cells produced with them.37 Additionally, due to crystal field splitting and the tetragonal deformation, the valence band splits into two sub-bands: a non-degenerate Γ4ν and a doubly degenerate Γ5ν band. For c/2a ratios below 1, it has been predicted that the Γ4ν band is higher in energy than the Γ5ν band.38 The energy difference between these two bands increases with increasing deviation from 1. Variations in the tetragonal deformation parameter can significantly alter the electronic transport properties of kesterite-type compounds and can be used to tune the thermoelectric properties of these materials.39

Neutron diffraction experiments were conducted in order to determine the distribution of cations within the crystal structure which, in turn, is used to estimate both the point defect species and their concentration. Since the contrast in neutron scattering lengths of the cations bj (Cu = 7.718 fm, Zn = 5.680 fm, Ge = 8.185 fm) is sufficiently strong and, unlike X-ray diffraction, scattering power is not a function of 2θ, neutron diffraction provides valuable data for refining site-specific anisotropic temperature factors (Baniso) and site occupancy factors (sof). The sof is refined for each cation site (Cu-2a, Cu-2c, Zn-2d, Ge-2b) and gives the basis for the experimentally deduced average neutron scattering lengths of the cation sites: (1)
Here, j stands for the Wyckoff position which is 2a, 2b, 2c and 2d. If sof ≠ 1, the average neutron scattering length of that particular Wyckoff position does differ from the neutron scattering length of the corresponding cation, meaning that a certain fraction of that site is occupied by another cation or is even partly vacant. In accordance with the given composition and the related off-stoichiometry types, the cation distribution is modeled by assuming the corresponding point defects on the concerned Wyckoff position: (2)
Here, V stands for vacancies, where X and Y are cation fractions, e.g. the cation which occupies this site according to the kesterite-type structure and another cation which then forms an antisite defect. The modeled cation distribution can be numerically solved such that the difference between the experimental average neutron scattering length and the modeled one becomes as minimal as possible. This model has to fulfill the compositional restraints and those of the type specific point defects and is ultimately constrained by the error bars of the experimental average neutron scattering lengths. The errors of the experimental average neutron scattering lengths are given by the errors of the site occupancy factors (sof) obtained by the Rietveld refinement of the neutron diffraction data (see ESI† Fig. S4).
This modeling of cation distribution has been applied to 28 out of 30 off-stoichiometric CZGSe powder samples, comprising one A/B-type, one K/D-type, two B/G-type, 11 G/F-type, and 13 F/I-type off-stoichiometric kesterite. The neutron diffraction patterns of the remaining two samples were too much deteriorated by peak overlap leading to poor results with respect to temperature factors as well as site occupancy factors and, thus, have not been included. The experimental average neutron scattering lengths successfully deduced from Rietveld analysis of neutron diffraction data are compiled in Fig. 6a, together with the modeled average neutron scattering lengths. The occupancies of the cation sites by different cations and vacancies can be established from the modeled average neutron scattering lengths (Fig. 6b).
 Fig. 6  Results from Rietveld analysis of neutron diffraction data of off-stoichiometric CZGSe powder samples showing a) the experimental average neutron scattering length b vs. modeled average neutron scattering length and b) the corresponding occupancies (Occ) of the cation sites. 
With regard to Fig. 6, it is obvious that in Cu-poor CZGSe (A/B- and B/G-type) the 2a and 2c Wyckoff positions are partly occupied by Zn, giving rise to ZnCu antisites and Cu/Zn disorder between the 2c and 2d Wyckoff positions. In contrast, from the slightly Cu-poor regime to the highly Cu-rich compositions (i.e. G/F-, F/I-, K/D-type), the Cu/Zn disorder is the predominant defect. The overall deficiency of Ge gives rise to ZnGe and CuGe antisite defects all over the compositional range.
The point defect concentration can be obtained by considering the unit cell volume, which has been calculated from the lattice parameters determined by Rietveld analysis of the XRD data, and the fractional occupancy of the Wyckoff positions being modeled for the point defects. However, cations on interstitial positions (i.e. Cui, Zni), self-evidently, cannot be treated like cations occupying regular Wyckoff positions given by symmetry but the cations remaining from the modeled distribution are considered as interstitials instead. The concentration of the different structural point defect types (vacancies, antisites, interstitials) is mainly of the order 1019 to 1021 cm−3 (Fig. 7), cumulatively corresponding to one point defect per about every third to fourth unit cell.
 Fig. 7  Concentration of type specific point defects and Cu/Zn disorder defect in off-stoichiometric kesterite-type CZGSe. 
Cu/Zn disorder is the defect common for all samples. A minimum in Cu/Zn disorder is observed in the slightly Cu-poor regime close to the stoichiometric point (Cu/(Zn + Ge) = 1) which coincides with the minimum in total point defect concentration (see ESI† Fig. S5). In Cu-poor samples, a high concentration of ZnCu and ZnGe antisites was found, and as the vast majority of the samples are Zn-rich, the Zni interstitial defect is present over a wide compositional range, with declining concentration under moderate Cu-rich conditions and finally ceasing at the onset of the K/D-type composition. From the stoichiometric point towards slightly Cu-rich conditions, the concentration of Cui interstitials along with CuGe antisites steeply increases. While the Cui defects continue following this trend, the concentration of CuGe antisites only smoothly increases towards highly Cu-rich conditions, and even decreases upon reaching the K/D-type composition where Cu is additionally consumed to form CuZn antisites.
According to the cationic radii (Cu+ = 0.60 Å, Zn2+ = 0.74 Å, and Ge4+ = 0.39 Å),40 compositional variations should be readily recognized by correspondingly altered lattice parameters. The impact of changing composition on unit cell metrics however is difficult to be evaluated as its effect is superimposed by these defect complexes with both varying concentration and different defect types, respectively. The increase in unit cell volume from Cu-poor conditions to the slightly Cu-rich regime might be due to the fact that the increase in Cu content is faster than the decrease in Zn content. This assumption seems to be valid until Cu/(Zn + Ge) ≈ 1.05 where the onset of the decrease in lattice parameter a and, consequently, the drop in unit cell volume are observed, although the Cu and Zn contents do change in the same manner as those in the Cu-poor region. However, the rapid decrease in unit cell volume to some extent correlates with the decrease in Zni interstitial concentration, though the Cui interstitial concentration further steeply increases but lacks the ability to counteract the unit cell shrinkage due to its smaller radius. Germanium, on the other hand, can be basically ruled out to have a significant impact on the evolution of unit cell metrics as the germanium content remains fairly constant (cf.Fig. 4a and b and ESI† Fig. S6) and as it is solely found on its designated position (cf.Fig. 6b).
Diffuse reflectance hyperspectral imaging has been used to evaluate the bandgap of the powders synthesized. Tauc plots generated with the Kubelka–Munk function were used for the bandgap calculation (see ESI† Fig. S7).41,42 A gradual bandgap widening has been observed as the Cu content decreases in the powders (Fig. 8). An increase of up to 40 meV is observed in kesterite-type CZGSe with Cu/(Zn + Ge) ∼1 (1.36 eV) to Cu/(Zn + Ge) ∼0.84 (1.4 eV). A similar bandgap widening has also been observed in CZTSe thin films as the Cu content decreases in their overall composition.37,43 This increase in bandgap with decreasing Cu content is attributed to a downshift of the valence band maximum which is mainly formed by antibonding states from the hybridization of Cu-d and Se-p orbitals.44,45 An increase of reflectance below the bandgap of all the powders with Cu/(Zn + Ge) > 1 could not be observed, limiting the bandgap calculation just to Cu-poor samples. All the Cu-rich samples have shown a high concentration of CuGe point defects (Fig. 7), which by analogy with CuSn have been predicted to introduce deep states in kesterite-type semiconductors that are detrimental to the solar cell performance.46 These deep states can induce sub-bandgap absorption explaining why it was not possible to observe any increase in reflectance in these samples. In addition, this also suggests that CZGSe with Cu-poor composition should also be preferred for the fabrication of solar cells as observed for CZTSe.37,46,47

Conclusions
Off-stoichiometric CZGSe powder samples have successfully been synthesized by solid state reaction. The formation of single-phase CZGSe samples however seems more likely to happen in the Cu-rich regime. From neutron diffraction data, the cation distribution in the kesterite-type structure could be established applying the average neutron scattering length analysis method, and the occurring defect types and their correlation with composition have been successfully investigated. While compositional changes are clearly reflected by the tetragonal deformation c/2a, the lattice parameters a and c seem differently responding to changing point defect types and concentration, respectively. The CuGe antisite defect which is known to greatly deteriorate the opto-electronic properties starts to appear at Cu/(Zn + Ge) ≈ 1, and its concentration generally increases towards more Cu-rich conditions. Diffuse reflectance measurements demonstrate that the energy of the bandgap increases in off-stoichiometric kesterite-type CZGSe with decreasing Cu/(Zn + Ge).
