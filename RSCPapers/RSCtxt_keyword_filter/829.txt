    , Accepted 24th August 2018First published on 6th September 2018AbstractThe inorganic halide perovskite Cs(Rb)PbI3 has attracted significant research interest for its application as a light-absorbing material in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Although there have been extensive studies on structural and electronic properties of inorganic halide perovskites, the investigation on their chemical stability is lacking. Therefore, we investigate the effect of substituting Rb for Cs in CsPbI3 on the chemical stability against decomposition using first-principles thermodynamics. The calculated Helmholtz free energy of solid solutions indicates that Cs1−xRbxPbI3 has good thermodynamic stability at room temperature due to the good miscibility of CsPbI3 and RbPbI3. By calculating the Helmholtz free energy difference of solid solutions Cs1−xRbxPbI3 from their constituents Cs1−xRbxI and PbI2, we find that the Rb content x ≈ 0.7 and 0.4 at zero and room temperature are the turning points, at which the chemical decomposition changes from endothermic to exothermic. From the calculated Gibbs free energy differences, we further highlight that RbPbI3 may decompose spontaneously at any temperature and pressure, while CsPbI3 in the cubic phase can be safe against decomposition in the temperature range of 0–600 K and the pressure range of 0–4 GPa. Our work reasonably explains the experimental observations and paves the way for understanding the chemical stability of inorganic halide perovskites and designing efficient inorganic halide PSCs.
1 Introduction
Recently, research interest in inorganic halide perovskites ABX3 (A = Cs, Rb; B = Pb, Sn; X = I, Br, Cl) has been rapidly growing for application in photovoltaic solar cells. This is due to their potential high stability against decomposition upon exposure to humidity, light and high temperature,1–7 as well as favourable properties for light-absorbing materials in perovskite solar cells (PSCs).8–13 Moreover, like organic–inorganic hybrid halide PSCs, all-inorganic halide PSCs have a promising advantage of easy fabrication in various ways such as solution processing and vapor deposition techniques.14,15 This raises hope to make the commercialization of PSCs using such inorganic perovskites a reality in the near future.
Through recent theoretical and experimental studies, it has been found that phase-stable cubic CsPbBr3 has too wide band gap to be used as a light-absorbing material for solar cells,16,17 while cubic α-phase CsPbI3 has an optimal band gap of 1.73 eV for a top cell absorber in tandem solar cells.8,18 However, the cubic CsPbI3 was reported to be phase-unstable, and that is why it can readily transform into the orthorhombic δ-phase, which has a large band gap over 2.7 eV at room temperature.19,20 Nevertheless, cubic α-phase CsPbI3 quantum dots have turned out to be stable and synthesized by carefully controlling the size of the quantum dot. Using these CsPbI3 quantum dots as a light-absorber, PSCs have been made, which exhibit a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 10% and relatively higher stability.21,22 Based on these experimental findings, it was suggested that CsPbI3 nanostructures including 2D nanoplates18,23 and colloidal nanocrystalline films2,24–27 stabilize the cubic phase. On the other hand, tin-based perovskite CsSnI3 has been found to possess a lower band gap of 1.3 eV, high optical absorption coefficient of ∼104 cm−1 and low exciton binding energy of 18 meV, being smaller than that of the typical organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite CH3NH3PbI3.10–12,28–30 In addition, CsSnI3 has an important advantage of non-toxicity because it is a lead-free compound. In spite of these advantages, the PCE of CsSnI3-based PSCs was experimentally reported to be too low (∼2%), possibly due to the unharmonious alignment of band energy levels between the light-absorber and charge extracting material, and the thermodynamic phase instability.31–33
There exist several first-principles studies for these inorganic perovskites, highlighting the success and failure of their application in PSCs.34–42 In the previous studies carried out by Walsh et al.,34,35 it was concluded through the lattice-dynamics of CsSnX3 and CsPbX3 (X = F, Cl, Br, I) that all the cesium–lead and cesium–tin halide perovskites exhibit a vibrational instability associated with octahedral tilting in the high-temperature cubic phase. This octahedral tilting was found to cause a positive band gap deformation, leading to a larger band gap compared with the cubic perovskite structure. The effect of chemical substitution of Rb for Cs on the structural, thermodynamic, and electronic properties of solid solutions Cs1−xRbxSnI3 was also investigated, emphasizing the importance of surface termination in the engineering of high performance PSCs.35
However, the most important question of how much the material stability of all-inorganic perovskites against their chemical decomposition can be enhanced is yet untouched. In fact, this is the most challenging towards the commercialization of PSCs when using the organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskite absorber, because CH3NH3PbI3 has been found to decompose into its ingredients CH3NH3I and PbI2 intrinsically as well as extrinsically upon the influence of humidity, temperature and ultraviolet light.43–48 Like the organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskite CH3NH3PbI3, the inorganic halide perovskite CsPbI3 can also be fabricated by spin-coating CsI and PbI2, and heating to ∼600 K.1 Therefore, a theoretical study on the material stability of Cs(Rb)PbI3 in opposition to its chemical decomposition into Cs(Rb)I and PbI2 at finite temperature and pressure is of great importance and urgency.
In this work, we first demonstrate the impact of Rb substituted for Cs on the thermodynamic stability of mixed rubidium–cesium iodide perovskite Cs1−xRbxPbI3 by using first-principles thermodynamic calculations. Insights into the thermodynamic stability of Cs1−xRbxPbI3 are gained by calculating the Helmholtz free energy of mixing of CsPbI3 and RbPbI3. We investigate the intrinsic instabilities of these solid solutions by estimating the formation energies of Cs1−xRbxPbI3 from their components Cs1−xRbxI and PbI2. We then perform lattice dynamic calculations for CsPbI3 and RbPbI3 to obtain their phonon dispersion curves and thus assess their thermodynamic stabilities at finite temperature and pressure. The Gibbs free energy differences between Cs(Rb)PbI3 and its components Cs(Rb)I and PbI2 are estimated, providing a conclusion that RbPbI3 is easily decomposed at any temperature and pressure while the decomposition of CsPbI3 is thermodynamically prohibited in the temperature range from 0 to 600 K and pressure range from 0 to 4 GPa.
2 Computational methods
All calculations were carried out using the pseudopotential plane-wave method within the density functional theory (DFT) framework, as implemented in the ABINIT package49,50 (version 8.4.4). For all the atoms, we used the Troullier–Martins type norm-conserving pseudopotentials (NCPPs)51 with valence electronic configurations of Cs-6s1, Rb-5s1, I-5s25p5, and Pb-5d106s26p2, constructed using the FHI98PP code.52 On increasing the Rb content x from 0.0 to 1.0 with an interval of 0.1, we generated the NCPPs of the virtual atoms Cs1−xRbx for calculating the decomposition energies and Helmholtz free energies of solid solutions Cs1−xRbxPbI3 using the virtual crystal approximation (VCA) method.43,44,53 The kinetic cutoff energy for the plane wave basis set was set to be 40 Ha, and k-point meshes of (8 × 8 × 8) for structural optimization and (6 × 6 × 6) for lattice-dynamics were used. These computational parameters guarantee a total energy convergence of 0.5 meV per unit cell and a phonon energy convergence of 0.1 meV. All the atomic positions were relaxed until the atomic forces were less than 1 meV Å−1. For describing the exchange–correlation interaction between the valence electrons, the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional (PBE)54 within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was used. In addition, we used the semi-empirical van der Waals (vdW-DF) correction.55
The chemical reaction for the synthesis of the solid solutions Cs1−xRbxPbI3 is suggested as follows: Cs1−xRbxI + PbI2 → Cs1−xRbxPbI3(1)The intrinsic instability can be estimated as the DFT total energy difference as follows: Ef = ECs1−xRbxPbI3 − (ECs1−xRbxI + EPbI2)(2)where ECs1−xRbxPbI3, ECs1−xRbxI, and EPbI2 are the DFT total energies of crystalline Cs1−xRbxPbI3, Cs1−xRbxI (cubic structure with the space group Pm3m), and PbI2 (hexagonal structure with the space group Pm1) compounds, respectively.
To assess the miscibility of CsPbI3 and RbPbI3 for forming the solid solutions Cs1−xRbxPbI3, the Helmholtz free energy of mixing for each composition is calculated as follows: ΔF = ΔU − TΔS(3)where ΔU and ΔS are the internal energy and entropy of mixing, and T is the absolute temperature. The internal energy of mixing is calculated according to the following equation: ΔU = ECs1−xRbxPbI3 − xERbPbI3 − (1 − x)ECsPbI3(4)
The entropy of mixing can be calculated in the homogeneous limit as follows: ΔS = −kB[xln(x) + (1 − x)ln(1 − x)](5)where kB is the Boltzmann constant. It should be noted that this approach was proven to be successful for both the all-inorganic and organic–inorganic perovskite solid solutions.35,56,57
To gain more insightful results for thermodynamic stability, the contribution of lattice vibration should be included through the calculation of phonon dispersion curves and phonon DOS. We applied the density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) method58 to the phonon calculations of Cs1−xRbxPbI3, Cs1−xRbxI and PbI2. The calculated phonon DOS was used in the estimation of thermodynamic potential functions such as Helmholtz and Gibbs free energies, at finite temperature and pressure for each crystalline compound. Based on these thermodynamic potential functions of Cs1−xRbxPbI3, Cs1−xRbxI and PbI2, we built the P–T diagram for the decomposition of Cs1−xRbxPbI3 into Cs1−xRbxI and PbI2.
The Gibbs free energy G(T,P) of a compound as a function of temperature T and pressure P is given as follows: G(T,P) = F(T,V) + PV(6)where F(T,V) is the Helmholtz free energy as a function of temperature and volume V. For the PV term, we calculated the total energies by systematically varying the volume, fitting them into the empirical equation of state (EOS) for solids to obtain the E(V) function, and estimating the pressure by conducting a differentiation like P = −(∂E/∂V)T.59 Within the adiabatic approximation, F(T,V) can be separated into ionic vibrational and electronic contributions as follows:59,60 F(T,V) = Fvib(T,V) + Fel(T,V) ≃ Fvib(T,V) + E(T = 0 K,V)(7)
It should be noted that in the electronic Helmholtz free energy equation, Fel(T,V) = E(T = 0 K,V) − TSel, the TSel term is ignored because the electronic temperature effect is negligible for non-metallic systems in the room temperature vicinity.61 Meanwhile, within the quasiharmonic approximation (QHA), the ionic Helmholtz free energy Fvib can be calculated as follows:59,60,62 (8)where ω(V) is the phonon frequency (or phonon energy) as a function of volume, M is the atomic mass, g(ω) is the normalized phonon DOS and ωL is the maximum of the phonon frequencies. Finally, we estimated the thermodynamic stability of Cs1−xRbxPbI3 against their decomposition into Cs1−xRbxI and PbI2 by calculating their Gibbs free energy difference as follows, ΔG(T,P) = GCs1−xRbxPbI3(T,P) − [GCs1−xRbxI(T,P) + GPbI2(T,P)](9)which is at finite temperature and pressure.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Miscibility of Cs1−xRbxPbI3 by mixing CsPbI3 and RbPbI3
The structural and electronic properties of the inorganic lead-iodide perovskite solid solutions Cs1−xRbxPbI3 were sufficiently described in the previous studies.36–42 In particular, we demonstrated that when substituting Rb for Cs in cubic α-phase CsPbI3, the performance of PSCs using it as a light-absorbing material can be enhanced due to the decrease of band gap and exciton binding energy.63 Therefore, we tried to tackle the major problem of material stability in this work.
The crystalline structures of Cs1−xRbxPbI3 and Cs1−xRbxI were supposed to be a cubic phase with a Pmm space group and that of PbI2 a hexagonal phase with a Pm1 space group, as shown in Fig. 1. We carried out the variable cell relaxations of their primitive unit cells. For the cases of solid solutions Cs1−xRbxPbI3 and Cs1−xRbxI, the VCA approach was used to treat the primitive unit cell containing one formula unit rather than supercells,43,44,53 and the optimized lattice constants were determined by varying the Rb content from x = 0 to 1 with a 0.1 interval. It was confirmed that Vegard's law is reasonably satisfied for lattice constants calculated by both VCA and (2 × 2 × 1) supercell methods, and the optimized lattice constant of CsPbI3 is in good agreement with the experimental value (6.31 Å vs. 6.29 Å) (see Fig. S1†). To further check the reliability of the VCA method, we compared the electronic density of states between VCA and supercell methods, which confirms a good agreement between each other except the average feature between Cs and Rb atoms in the VCA approach (see Fig. S2†).

In the assessment of the material stability of solid solutions Cs1−xRbxPbI3, the miscibility of CsPbI3 and RbPbI3 can play an important role. In previous work,63 we estimated the miscibility of the two constituent materials using a bowing parameter, which is a secondary coefficient in the quadratic fitting equation of the band gaps of Cs1−xRbxPbI3 as a function of the Rb content x. In this work, the bowing parameter was estimated to be 0.071 eV, which is smaller by one order than those of the mixed halide perovskites CH3NH3Pb(I1−xBrx)3 (ref. 43) and CH3NH3Pb(I1−xCIx)3.44 Such a smaller bowing parameter indicates a low compositional disorder and thus a good miscibility between CsPbI3 and RbPbI3. However, the bowing parameter is thought to give only a qualitative estimation of miscibility.
In order to thermodynamically describe the miscibility between CsPbI3 and RbPbI3, we calculated the Helmholtz free energy of mixing for these two materials using eqn (3)–(5). According to these equations, the free energy differences of the two end compounds CsPbI3 and RbPbI3 upon mixing are determined to be zero, and negative free energies of mixing indicate that the solid solutions Cs1−xRbxPbI3 are more stable than their individual components while positive values indicate that they are less stable.

Fig. 2 shows the Helmholtz free energy of mixing as a function of Rb content x at various temperatures. At absolute zero temperature, the Helmholtz free energies were calculated to be positive in the whole range of Rb contents, since the entropy term does not contribute to the free energy. This indicates that it is favourable for the solid solution Cs1−xRbxPbI3 at any Rb content to be separated into its constituents at 0 K. When increasing the temperature, the entropy effect should play an increasing role, leading to negative Helmholtz free energy of mixing, which indicates that the solid solutions are gradually stabilized at rising temperatures. In particular, all the solid solutions Cs1−xRbxPbI3 in the whole range of Rb contents were predicted to be more stable than their constituents at room temperature of 300 K. It should be noted that vibrational contributions to the free energy are not included since they are expected to give a negligible effect. This result is similar to the case of tin-based iodide perovskites Cs1−xRbxSnI3.35 Such a good miscibility of Rb and Cs in these solid solutions can be understood due to a close similarity between Rb and Cs elements. As our calculation reveals a good miscibility for forming Cs1−xRbxPbI3 from their constituents CsPbI3 and RbPbI3 at room temperature, it can be thought that the stability of the solid solutions is dependent on the stability of their two constituents.

3.2 Chemical stability of Cs1−xRbxPbI3 against decomposition into Cs1−xRbxI and PbI2
We focus our attention to the chemical stability of solid solutions Cs1−xRbxPbI3 against their decomposition into Cs1−xRbxI and PbI2 (x = 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.0) at finite temperature and pressure. To this end, we performed a series of SCF calculations by systematically varying the unit cell volume for the PV term and DFPT phonon calculations for the TS term to estimate the Gibbs free energies of all the compounds Cs1−xRbxPbI3, Cs1−xRbxI and PbI2.
To estimate the PV term, we calculated the total energies of each compound by increasing the unit cell volume from 0.9V0 to 1.1V0 with 10 volume points, where V0 is a predicted equilibrium volume with the lowest energy. In the case of PbI2 with the hexagonal lattice, we optimized the lattice constant ratio of a/c while allowing atomic relaxation at each fixed volume. Subsequently, we did a fitting of the obtained E–V data into the natural strain 4th-order EOS,64 thus determining the equilibrium volume V0 and bulk modulus B (see Fig. S3†). Then, we derived pressures ranging from 0 to 20 GPa as a function of volume by differentiating the E(V) function as shown in Fig. 3. The lattice constants as a function of pressure are shown in Fig. S4.† It is natural that the cell volumes and lattice constants for all the compounds decrease as the pressure increases. We note that there might be pressure-induced phase transitions under very high pressure, but they are beyond the scope of this work.
 Fig. 3  Pressure as a function of volume for cubic CsPbI3, RbPbI3, CsI, RbI and hexagonal PbI2. 
Using the calculated P–V data, we estimated the enthalpy H = E + PV for all the compounds. To consider the pure effect of pressure on chemical decomposition, we calculated the formation enthalpy for the chemical reaction, eqn (1), as follows: ΔH = HCs1−xRbxPbI3 − [HCs1−xRbxI + HPbI2](10)
As can be seen in Fig. 4, the formation enthalpies of Cs1−xRbxPbI3 increase gradually as the pressure increases due to the enhancement of the PV term, indicating that their chemical stabilities against decomposition get worse upon pressing. Moreover, it was found that for the case of CsPbI3 crystals, ΔH was calculated to be negative at the pressures ranging from 0 to ∼4 GPa, indicating that the cubic CsPbI3 crystals can exist in a stable state at a lower pressure less than ∼4 GPa upon chemical decomposition. When increasing the Rb content x, the turning point of pressure gradually shifted downward, and at over x = 0.8, ΔH was found to be positive in the whole range of pressures, indicating that the solid solution with x > 0.8 and RbPbI3 can be readily decomposed into their constituents even at atmospheric pressure. It should be noted that although CsPbI3 was predicted to be decomposed at the pressure of ∼4 GPa, this pressure is 4 × 104 times larger than the atmospheric pressure for solar cell operation, and thus this pressure has no significant impact on the stability of CsPbI3 and the performance of PSCs. Then, what about the impact of temperature on chemical decomposition?

To investigate the finite temperature effect, we calculated the phonon dispersion curves and the corresponding phonon DOS of Cs1−xRbxPbI3, Cs1−xRbxI and PbI2, which were used in the calculation of ionic vibrational contribution to the Helmholtz free energy given in eqn (8). Fig. 5 shows the phonon dispersion curves along the line passing through the high symmetric points (R, M, X, Γ) in the vibrational Brillouin zone (BZ), and total and atomic resolved phonon DOS in cubic Cs1−xRbxPbI3 and Cs1−xRbxI (see Fig. S5† for those of PbI2). In the calculation of phonon dispersion, we took into account the coupling between atomic displacements, and the homogeneous electric field existed in the case of polar insulators for longitudinal optic (LO) modes at the Γ point. Thus, splitting between these modes and the transverse optic (TO) modes (LO–TO splitting) appears at the G point in all the compounds considered in this work.

The phonon dispersion is drawn along the line containing high symmetric points in the vibrational Brillouin zone. Soft phonon modes with imaginary (negative) energy are presented in red colour, and LO–TO splitting appears at the Γ point. 
For the solid solutions Cs1−xRbxPbI3, we observe imaginary phonon modes represented by negative energies in the phonon band structure, so-called soft phonon, which are a typical characteristic of ferroelectrics in the cubic perovskite structure.34,65,66 In contrast, all the phonon modes were found to be positive in Cs1−xRbxI and PbI2 compounds. The identification of the soft phonon indicates a structural instability, which may be associated with the atomic displacement (e.g., in ATiO3 (A = Ba, Pb), the position of the Ti ion is slightly deviated from the centre of an oxygen octahedron53) and/or the octahedral distortion (e.g., in CsBX3 (B = Pb, Sn; X = F, Cl, Br, I), the halide octahedron is tilted, described as a linear combination of in-plane and out-of-plane rotations along the crystallographic axes34). This vibrational or lattice instability is known to drive a phase transition induced by temperature and pressure in perovskite-type crystals, from the high symmetry cubic phase at high temperature to the lower symmetry phase at lower temperature, including tetragonal, orthorhombic and trigonal or rhombohedral. It is worth noting that for the case of oxide perovskites the lower symmetry phases are ferroelectric states while the cubic phase represents a paraelectric state. In the case of CsPbI3, it was found from the experiment13 that the cubic phase can be stable over room temperature (634 K) while below 298 K, the orthorhombic phase is stable.
In Fig. 5, both CsPbI3 and RbPbI3 compounds are found to exhibit BZ boundary point (R, M, X) instabilities as well as BZ centre (Γ) point instability. It is worth noting that the BZ boundary distortions are antiferroelectric so that long-range spontaneous polarization is not formed due to a compensation of opposing polarization induced in neighbouring unit cells, whereas Γ-point instability induces a ferroelectric distortion.34 From the atomic resolved phonon DOS, it is clear that Rb and I atoms are responsible for these lattice instabilities while Cs and Pb atoms are little related to these. With increasing the Rb content, the portion of the virtual atom Cs1−xRbx increases gradually. This indicates that the interaction between Rb and I atoms can induce the iodine octahedral tilting, in which the centre is occupied by a Pb atom, and drive the phase transition. This mechanism is in contrast to the case of oxide perovskites such as BaTiO3, in which the Ti atom placed at the centre of oxygen octahedra is mainly responsible for the lattice instability.
It should be emphasized that the lattice instability or thermodynamic instability discussed above is different from the chemical instability for the decomposition of the compound. In order to account for the temperature-dependence of chemical decomposition, the Helmholtz free energy difference of Cs1−xRbxPbI3 with respect to Cs1−xRbxI and PbI2 was calculated as follows: ΔF = FCs1−xRbxPbI3 − [FCs1−xRbxI + FPbI2](11)
By performing a post-process of the calculated phonon DOS, we obtained the Helmholtz free energies of all the compounds, that is, Cs1−xRbxPbI3, Cs1−xRbxI and PbI2, on increasing the temperature from 0 to 1000 K with an interval of 100 K. Then, the Helmholtz free energy difference ΔF in Cs1−xRbxPbI3 as a function of temperature was determined and plotted as shown in Fig. 6. It is worth noting that for the case of zero temperature we calculated the formation energies of Cs1−xRbxPbI3 from their components Cs1−xRbxI and PbI2 using eqn (2).
 Fig. 6  Helmholtz free energy difference of Cs1−xRbxPbI3 from their constituents Cs1−xRbxI and PbI2 (a) as a function of temperature, with increasing the Rb content from x = 0 to x = 1 with an interval of 0.2, and (b) as a function of Rb content x, with increasing the temperature from T = 0 K to T = 1000 K with an interval of 100 K. 
As shown in Fig. 6(a), the free energy difference ΔF in these solid solutions Cs1−xRbxPbI3 gradually increases as the temperature increases in accordance with the general knowledge of the chemical stability of the compound upon heating. In the case of CsPbI3, the sign of ΔF changes from the negative to the positive at ∼600 K, indicating that CsPbI3 is stable upon chemical decomposition in the temperature range of 0–600 K. When increasing the Rb content, the turning point of temperature shifted downward. At the end for the case of RbPbI3, it was estimated to be positive in the whole range of temperatures, indicating that RbPbI3 is unstable upon chemical decomposition at any temperature. It should be noted that in the calculation of the free energy, the imaginary phonon modes were excluded because they might not be necessarily related to the chemical stability, the aim of this work, though the anharmonic contribution from these must be required to predict the phase transition temperature and pressure. Moreover, in spite of ignoring the anharmonicity, our result agrees well with the experimental fact that smooth and uniform thin films of cubic CsPbI3 can be synthesized and stabilized by spin-coating a 1:1 CsI:PbI2 solution and heating to 600 K.1
To see the stability tendency with increasing the Rb content clearly, we plotted the free energy difference ΔF as a function of Rb content x in Fig. 6(b). As the Rb content increases, ΔF was found to increase gradually at any temperature, indicating that the chemical stability of cubic Cs1−xRbxPbI3 could decrease with increasing the Rb content. In the temperature range from zero to ∼600 K, there exists a turning point at which the chemical decomposition changes from endothermic to exothermic, meaning that these solid solutions may be decomposed spontaneously without any extrinsic factors. For instance, the turning points of the Rb content were found to be x ≈ 0.7 and x ≈ 0.4 at zero and room temperature, respectively. It should be noted that once the compound decomposes with a production of PbI2, the performance of solar cells could be degraded owing to the large band gap of PbI2 over 2.5 eV. These results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental findings that the nanoscale CsPbI3 could stabilize the cubic α-phase,2,24–27 but the cubic RbPbI3 is rarely observed.4,13 Therefore, it can be said that although the addition of Rb to the cubic CsPbI3 is expected to enhance the performance of PSCs, the amount of Rb substituted for Cs should be carefully controlled due to a loss of material stability.
The compositional stability of the compound from its components can be interpreted by analyzing charge transfer upon its formation, and to this end, we analyzed the Hirshfeld charge of each atom in CsPbI3 and RbPbI3 (see Table S1†). It was found that upon the formation of cubic Cs(Rb)PbI3 crystals, Pb and Cs (Rb) atoms lose 0.295 (0.283) electron and 0.248 (0.228) electron, respectively, while the I atom gains −0.543 (−0.511) electron. When comparing between CsPbI3 and RbPbI3, the amount of charge transfer in the former compound is found to be slightly larger than that in the latter compound, implying that on going from x = 1.0 to x = 0.0, the compositional stability becomes better due to enhancement of charge transfer.
We show the lattice constants in Fig. 7 and the bulk modulus in Fig. S6† of the compounds, CsPbI3, RbPbI3, CsI, RbI and PbI2, with increasing the temperature to 1000 K. Note that the bulk modulus was obtained by fitting the E–V data into EOS. When the temperature is increased, the lattice constants are found to increase while the bulk modulus decreases, agreeing well with the common understanding of the thermal expansion of materials.

Finally, to take the temperature and pressure effects together into account, we calculated the Gibbs free energy difference of two end compounds CsPbI3 and RbPbI3 with respect to their constituents CsI, RbI and PbI2 at finite temperature and pressure simultaneously. By using the calculated PV and TS terms, the Gibbs free energy of all the compounds in the temperature range from 0 to 1000 K and the pressure range from 0 to 20 GPa was determined. Then, the Gibbs free energy difference of each perovskite can be obtained straightforwardly according to eqn (9).
In Fig. 8, we show the calculated Gibbs free energy difference of CsPbI3 and RbPbI3 with respect to their constituents CsI, RbI and PbI2 as a function of pressure with the rising temperature from 0 to 1000 K, which can be regarded as P–T diagrams for the chemical stabilities of these materials upon their decompositions. For the case of CsPbI3, the obtained P–T diagram contains the individual information for pressure and temperature discussed above. From these P–T diagrams, it is revealed that RbPbI3 is unstable (that is, it can be readily decomposed) at any temperature and pressure, whereas CsPbI3 is stable upon chemical decomposition in the temperature range from 0 to ∼600 K and the pressure range from 0 to ∼4 GPa. Therefore, we can conclude that when mixing RbPbI3 with CsPbI3, the chemical stability of solid solutions Cs1−xRbxPbI3 could get worse, although their miscibility would be good.

4 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have investigated the effect of substituting Rb for Cs on the thermodynamic miscibility and chemical stability of the all-inorganic iodide perovskite solid solutions Cs1−xRbxPbI3 by using the virtual crystal approximation approach within the framework of density functional theory. First we estimated the miscibility of the two end pure compounds CsPbI3 and RbPbI3, demonstrating that Cs1−xRbxPbI3 becomes stable at room temperature due to the increase of configurational entropy. Then, we performed the calculations of total energy versus unit cell volume to estimate the PV term and phonon calculations of all the crystalline compounds to extract the TS term, eventually providing the estimation of the enthalpy, Helmholtz and Gibbs free energy differences for the chemical decomposition of Cs1−xRbxPbI3 into their constituents Cs1−xRbxI and PbI2. From the calculated Helmholtz free energy difference, it has been concluded that the Rb contents x ≈ 0.7 and 0.4 at zero and room temperature are the turning points at which the decomposition reaction changes from endothermic to exothermic, indicating the best performance of PSCs at these Rb contents. The calculated Gibbs free energy differences indicate that the decomposition of RbPbI3 in the cubic phase into its constituents RbI and PbI2 may occur spontaneously at any temperature and pressure, whereas CsPbI3 in the cubic phase can exist safely against chemical decomposition in the temperature range of 0–600 K and the pressure range of 0–4 GPa. We believe that this work paves the way for understanding the material stability of inorganic halide perovskites and thus designing efficient and stable inorganic halide PSCs.
