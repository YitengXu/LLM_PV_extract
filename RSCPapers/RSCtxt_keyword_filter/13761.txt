    , Accepted 7th February 2013First published on 7th February 2013AbstractElectrostatic spray deposition for the fabrication of well cross-linked upright-standing boron-doped ZnO (BZO) nanoporous nanosheets and their applications in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are investigated with the aim of developing cost-effective alternative fabrication methods and improving the ZnO-based DSSCs performance. The highest solar-to-electric energy conversion efficiency of 6.75% is obtained by using the well cross-linked upright-standing BZO nanoporous nanosheets. This efficiency is significantly improved over the 3.0% achieved for BZO films only including nanosized crystallites and also higher than the 2.62% for un-doped ZnO nanosheets. The influence of the sputtering time of platinum (Pt) on the photovoltaic performance of the DSSC is also investigated. The fabricated cells exhibited highly durable cell performances, even after one month under atmospheric conditions. The efficiency achieved for the best DSSC in this work is the highest ever reported value for a ZnO nanoporous nanosheets-based DSSC. The performance enhancement of the BZO cells can be reasonably inferred to arise from the intrinsic components of the films, as well as the sunlight harvesting and photon-to-electron transfer process of the cells. In addition, the photocurrent density of our BZO-based cell is now comparable to that of the TiO2-based cells, and its conversion efficiency has reached more than half of the highest value (11.18%) recorded with the TiO2 electrode.
1 Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) based on metal–organic complex dyes or organic dyes and oxide semiconductors have recently developed as the most promising candidates to achieve efficient solar-energy conversion since they are inexpensive, easy to manufacture and less expensive than silicon solar cells.1–3 The DSSC is a photoelectrochemical system, comprised of a porous structured wide-bandgap oxide semiconductor (ZnO or TiO2) film as the photosensitized anode providing an increased surface area for dye molecule adsorption.3 TiO2 nanoparticles3,4 and nanoporous structures5,6 have been greatly studied as a DSSC photoelectrode material. The increase in the conversion efficiency (η) hindered by the energy loss because of recombination between electrons and either the electron-accepting species in the electrolyte or the oxidized dye during the charge transport processes.1,7–10 TiO2 nanocrystals caused a pronounced recombination problem due to the lack of a depletion layer on the TiO2 nanocrystallite surface and it developed into a serious problem when the film thickness of the photoelectrode increases.1 In order to overcome and resolve this issue, ZnO-based DSSC technology as an alternative to TiO2 has been investigated as one of the most able materials for solar cells. ZnO retains an energy band structure and physical properties similar to those of TiO2, but its electron mobility is higher by 2–3 orders of magnitude.11 Thus, ZnO is expected to show faster electron transport with reduced recombination loss. ZnO is a superior photoanode material. It is cheap, abundant in nature and easy to prepare due to its ease of crystallization and anisotropic growth.1
Morphology, size and the size distribution of ZnO nanoparticles play an important role in deciding the properties and hence various forms of ZnO have been synthesized via a variety of methods with the intention of enhancing the solar-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency. Bulk ZnO is an insulator; however, when it is deposited in the form of thin films it shows semiconductor properties. This transition from insulator to semiconductor occurs as a result of its deviation in stoichiometry. The properties of ZnO films depend on the growth conditions, chemical composition and the preparative methods. Doped ZnO thin films exhibit relatively low resistivity, high transmittance and chemical stability when compared with un-doped ZnO thin films.12 These doped ZnO thin films could be used as an active electrode in DSSC; however, they are yet to be investigated. In the DSSC, the ZnO film serves as an optical window determining the amount of light entering the device and as the electrode extracting photocurrent. Among the dopants, boron (B) doping could be the most effective for tailoring the properties because the element has the highest electronegativity, lowest cationic radius, easy handling, low material toxicity, and low cost.
Competition between the recombination of photoexcited carriers and generation in DSSC is a main obstacle for developing higher conversion efficiency.9 To date, numerous morphologies of low dimensional ZnO nanostructures such as nanowires,1,2,13 nanobelts,14 nanotubes,1,15 and nanotips,16 have been synthesized and are expected to improve the electron diffusion length in the photoelectrode films by supplying a direct conduction pathway for the fastest collection of photogenerated electrons, and is one of the possible solutions. Among these, films of one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures of ZnO, such as nanotubes and nanowires, were highly preferred for the semiconducting films of DSSCs, due to their direct conduction pathways for the rapid collection of photo-injected electrons at the substrate of the photoanode. Suh et al.17 and Baxter and Aydil18 have presented a dendritic ZnO NW DSSC. They grew ZnO NWs by expensive chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and showed relatively low efficiency (0.5%) due to an insufficient surface area. In addition, Jiang et al.19 reported a ZnO nanoflower photoanode material. Moreover, mesoporous nanoparticles were used as anodes because of their larger inner surface areas to absorb dye. However, the nanoparticles have slower electron transport due to the recombination. Thus, the performances of DSSCs with these nanostructures of ZnO were hindered because of the low surface areas available for dye adsorption.20 Alternatively, another convincing technique to enhance the efficiency in DSSC is to build a light scattering layer with enhanced optical absorption and photocapture efficiency in photoelectrode films.21–23 Many researchers have succeeded in improving the η of TiO2-based DSSC by light-scatterers.24,25 In the case of ZnO-based DSSC, Fujihara et al.26 fabricated a micrometer composite structured ZnO film by one-step self-assembly electrodeposition, with a η of only 2.0%. In addition, hierarchical structure ZnO aggregates composed of submicron sized crystallites can be used as efficient light scatterers, offering a relatively large specific surface area framework, and removing the adverse effect caused by the lowered adsorption of dye-molecules in the film. For the case employing a hierarchical structure of ∼300 nm ZnO colloids, such an approach can increase the conversion efficiency up to 3.5%.27 However, the drawback is that the employment of these particles into nanocrystalline films will unavoidably lower the internal surface area of the photoelectrode film and, therefore, counteract the enhancement effect of light scattering on the optical absorption, consequently increasing the recombination rate of photogenerated carriers.
In order to increase the surface area, energy conversion efficiency and light harvesting characteristics, the two-dimensional (2D) ZnO nanosheets have been developed and used in the photoanodes of DSSCs.28–32 Hosono et al. reported the chemical bath deposition method for the fabrication of ZnO porous nanosheets based DSSC, but the ZnO nanosheets based cells showed an efficiency of only 3.9% because of the lower surface area for the adsorption of dye.33 Wang et al. applied the electrodeposition technique to synthesize a thin film of ZnO nanosheets.34 Xu et al. used this kind of electrodeposited ZnO nanosheet for the preparation of the photoanode of a DSSC,35 however, the cell showed an efficiency of only 2.3%. This cell efficiency was limited because of a low surface area for dye adsorption and also because of the nanosheets being too thick. Thus, in order to enhance the performance of a DSSC, it is necessary to synthesize the ZnO nanosheets with a small sheet thickness. In addition, the best light-to-electricity conversion efficiency (η) obtained with a mosaic structure composed of nanosheets was 5.41%.29 In the above-mentioned reports, techniques involving electrodeposition, chemical vapor deposition, chemical bath deposition and the doctor-blade method were utilized with varying degrees of expense, difficulty of operation, and sophistication to synthesize the thin films of nanosheets. With reference to these techniques, electrostatic spray deposition was selected for the fabrication of nanoporous nanosheets taking into account the following advantages: cost-effective and simple setup, large choice of the precursors, high deposition efficiency and operation in an ambient atmosphere. Moreover, it does not require the use of an in situ activation source such as photo, thermal, or plasma to carry out the chemical reactions.
In the present report, ZnO and BZO films composed of well cross-linked upright-standing nanoporous nanosheets are deposited by an electrostatic spray deposition method. Thus, the prepared BZO photoanode is employed to fabricate a DSSC and the pertinent photovoltaic performance is studied. In addition, even a single BZO nanosheet itself nanoporous in nature, which provides the high porosity, high surface area, effective electron transport, and a solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency of 6.75% (almost more than double that of un-doped ZnO nanosheets (2.62%)) for the DSSC, which is the highest ever reported value for a ZnO nanoporous nanosheets-based DSSC. Moreover, the best solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency of 6.75% was also higher than 1.5–2.4% for the ZnO nanocrystalline films,36–38 2.7–3.5% for the uniform ZnO aggregate films,27 and also better than the mosaic structure composed of nanosheets.29 The incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) for the DSSC based on the well-stacked upright-standing BZO nanoporous nanosheets photoanode has the highest value of 92% at 520 nm; this IPCE value is extraordinarily high. In addition, the preparation procedure is simple as compared with the doctor-blade method, chemical bath deposition, and electrodeposition. The present investigation thus has ramifications on ZnO nanoporous nanosheets-based DSSC.
2 Experimental section
2.1 Electrospraying set-up
Boron-doped ZnO (BZO) films composed of nanoporous nanosheets were deposited by using an electrospraying set-up at atmospheric pressure.39 The precursor solution was pumped by a syringe pump (KD200, KD Scientific Inc., USA) through flexible plastic tubing to the tip of a small stainless steel needle. The precursor solution was atomized at the tip of a needle into an aerosol of fine droplets by applying high voltage using a DC power supply (Korea switching, Inc., Republic of Korea) between the needle and the substrate. Under electrostatic force this aerosol of charged droplets was directed to the heated substrate. The substrate temperature was maintained at some constant value by using a temperature controller unit that consists of a temperature controller and heating element.
2.2 Deposition of BZO nanoporous nanosheets
Zinc acetate dihydrate (Junsei chemical) and boric acid (Sigma Aldrich) were used as precursors for the electrospraying method. These precursors were dissolved in an ethanol–water (30:70 v/v) mixture in order to produce a 0.05 M solution under vigorous magnetic stirring for 1 h at room temperature. The atomic percentage of the dopant in the solution was [B/Zn] = 2 at.%. A few drops of hydrochloric acid (37–38%) were added to the precursor solution in order to get the clear solution. The flow rate of the solution was maintained at a rate of 0.003 mL min−1. A distance of 4 cm was fixed between the needle tip and the substrate. A positive voltage (5.5 to 5.6 kV) was applied to the needle in order to convert the precursor solution into an aerosol in order to get a stable cone-jet mode which is appropriate for fine film formation. The fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) was used as a substrate, washed with isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and water for proper cleaning. The temperature of the substrate ranged from 170 to 200 °C, and the operation time was 30 min for all the depositions. Four different samples (sample 1 (at 170 °C), 2 (at 180 °C), 3 (at 190 °C), and 4 (at 200 °C)) composed of BZO nanosheet films with different morphologies and similarly, four different samples (sample 5 (at 170 °C), 6 (at 180 °C), 7 (at 190 °C), and 8 (at 200 °C)) consist of un-doped ZnO nanosheet films with various morphologies were fabricated by using the electrospraying method.
2.3 ZnO and BZO cell preparation
BZO films composed of nanoporous nanosheets were rinsed with DI water and baked in air at 350 °C for 30 min to remove any residual organics and optimize solar cell performance.13 The nanosheets films were then sensitized by immersing them into 0.5 mM ethanolic solution of the ruthenium complex cis-[RuL2(NCS)2] (commercially known as N3 dye) for approximately 20 min. This immersion time was chosen to prevent the dissolution of surface Zn atoms and the formation of Zn2+/dye complexes, which was believed to be harmful to the charge transport from the dye to the semiconductor and also block the electron transport from the dye to the semiconductor.20 The films of nanosheets were then rinsed with ethanol to remove the additional dye. The Pt-coated thin films on the FTO, which served as counter electrodes, were constructed by sputtering Pt on FTO glasses for 5, 10, 40, 70, 110 and 160 s (under a sputter current of 40 mA). The electrolyte solution, consisted of 0.3 M LiI, 0.06 M I2, 0.5 M t-BPy and 1.0 M DMPII in acetonitrile. The active area of the resulting cell exposed in light was approximately 0.25 cm2 (0.5 cm × 0.5 cm). For comparison, a ZnO cell was also fabricated according to a similar procedure as mentioned above. Unless mentioned, the synthesis temperature and the sputtering time of 170 °C and 10 s respectively, were kept constant and the solar cell performance was checked after zero days.
2.4 Characterization
For the surface morphology of the nanosheets films, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed by using a Magellan 400 microscope coupled with an X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer DX-4, which further revealed the elementary composition of the nanosheets. The crystal structure of the nanosheets films was analyzed with the help of an X-ray diffractometer (D/MAX-2500 Rigaku Co.) using Cu kα radiation (λ = 1.5405 Å). The current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of the cells was measured under AM1.5G 100 mW cm−1 (ref. 2) illumination from a solar simulator (Newport) immediately after cell assembly. The BET data of the doped and un-doped ZnO nanosheet-based samples was obtained with the help of an ASAP 2010 surface area analyzer. Monochromatic light in the range of 400–800 nm was obtained by using a series of filters and the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement was performed on a Keithley Model 2000 Source Meter. The optical-absorption spectra, transmittance spectra and the amount of dye adsorbed on the photoanode was desorbed by immersing the photoanode into a 1.0 M NaOH solution (50:50, v/v), and its concentration was measured using an ultraviolet visible-near infrared (UV-VIS-NIR) spectrophotometer (UV-3101PC).
3 Results and discussion
The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image (Fig. 1a) indicates that the film is well stacked with two-dimensional well cross-linked upright-standing BZO nanoporous nanosheets. The sample that was synthesized at 170 °C is denoted as sample 1. No sheets clumped together and thereby making huge gaps among themselves; in other words the BZO nanosheets film was porous, which is necessary for the penetration of electrolyte into the photoanode. The sheets are perpendicular to the substrate, which is required for a higher surface area for dye-adsorption and for facile electron transfer in a photoanode. This kind of microstructure is expected to be beneficial for the diffusion of electrolyte into the film in a DSSC. Formation of the nanoscale width of these nanosheets was confirmed under a close view (Fig. 1b). Furthermore, at the cross-section, the nanosheets identity remained constant i.e., neither structural nor dimensional change was observed. These nanosheets were ∼500 to 800 nm in length and ∼40 to 60 nm in width. Moreover, it was observed that the nanosheets were rather vertically accumulated on the substrate (though they tend to bend in different angles), and in all the cases the top surface of the film has a macroporous structure. It can be seen that the films have a good uniformity on a large scale without any crack gaps. The pores and sheets were distributed uniformly in a regular fashion. In addition, even a single BZO nanosheet itself was nanoporous in nature, which provides the high porosity, high surface area, and effective electron transport. Similarly, the un-doped ZnO nanoporous nanosheet films (sample 5, see Fig. S1 in the ESI†) exhibits the same structure and characteristics when compared with the BZO nanosheet films.

Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) measurement reveals the co-existence of B, Zn and O (oxygen) in the BZO nanosheets film (Fig. 2a), demonstrating that B atoms have been successfully doped into the ZnO nanosheets films. In addition, by scanning BZO nanosheets in different areas, the average B concentration was estimated to be ∼2.1 at.% (Fig. 2b). The statistical analysis of over a dozen nanosheets demonstrates the uniform composition of B content throughout the specimen. Quantitative analysis reveals that the average amount of B content was about 2.1% in each B-doped nanosheet. Similarly, the EDS and the estimation of the average B concentration were performed for all other BZO nanosheet film samples. The results also reveal that the B exists in the nanosheet films.

Fig. 3 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the BZO and pure ZnO samples (sample 1), in which all the major peaks can be well assigned to those of wurtzite (hexagonal) ZnO with lattice constants of a = 0.325 nm and c = 0.521 nm (JCPDS: 36–1451). It has been found that the intensity of the (0 0 2) peak is much stronger than that of other peaks, suggesting the (0 0 1) crystal face might be the primary face of the nanosheets. The inset of Fig. 3 shows the comparison of the boron-doped and un-doped ZnO nanosheets in the range 2θ = 31–37° corresponding to (1 0 0), (0 0 2) and (1 0 1) peaks. By observing the positions of the peaks it can be seen that all the peaks shift slightly toward the larger angle side. The peaks’ shift is attributed to the lattice expansion induced by the boron-doping. The evaluated c-axis lattice constant of the boron-doped nanosheets is 0.5246 ± 0.0004 nm, which is much larger than that of pure ZnO (c = 0.5109 nm). This shows that as the B is introduced into the ZnO, some B atoms lodge in the position of the Zn atoms.

In addition to sample 1, three more BZO nanosheets films (samples 2, 3, and 4) with different morphologies were prepared at 180, 190, and 200 °C, respectively. Fig. 4 shows typical SEM images of these three samples, revealing the gradual degradation in the degree of the upright-standing position of the nanosheets with increasing synthesis temperature. Sample 2, synthesized at 180 °C, was similar to sample 1 and consists of BZO nanoporous nanosheets, but sample 2 shows a slight destruction of the standing nanosheets (Fig. 4a). Sample 3, synthesized at 190 °C (Fig. 4b), consists of partial nanosheets. It is clear that in sample 3, most of the nanosheets have lost their standing position. As the synthesis temperature increased further to 200 °C, the obtained BZO film (sample 4, Fig. 4c) only presents the primary nanocrystallites without any nanoporous nanosheets. The highly porous nature of these BZO films (samples 2, 3, and 4) was also observed with the help of magnified SEM images (see Fig. S2 in the ESI†). Similarly, three more samples (sample 6, 7, and 8) of un-doped ZnO nanoporous nanosheet films (see Fig. S3 in the ESI†) with various morphologies were prepared at 180, 190, and 200 °C, respectively. These samples also exhibit the same structure and characteristics when compared with BZO nanosheet films (Fig. 4). On the other hand XRD analysis revealed that all of the other three BZO (samples 2, 3, and 4) films and the un-doped ZnO (samples 6, 7, and 8) had the hexagonal wurtzite structure, despite the different synthesis temperatures and morphologies.

The BZO nanosheet film of approximately ∼1.5 ± 0.2 μm in thickness was formed using an electrospraying method onto a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass at 170 °C (sample 1) as shown in Fig. 5c. It also indicates that the nanosheets film was constructed by assembling nanosheets in a compact way. For comparison, un-doped ZnO film of nanosheets with a thickness of ∼1.5 ± 0.2 μm, identical to that of the BZO nanosheet film was also fabricated, and it was found that the two films maintained an analogous structure and morphology (Fig. 5a and b). In addition, for other un-doped ZnO and BZO samples the films of the nanosheets have the same thickness of about ∼1.5 ± 0.2 μm.

The as-prepared BZO and un-doped ZnO solar cells were characterized by measuring the current–voltage behavior while the cells were irradiated by AM1.5 simulated sunlight with a power density of 100 mW cm−2. Fig. 6 shows typical photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the four different BZO samples and one un-doped ZnO sample (sample 5). For the ZnO based cell, the short-circuit current density (JSC) of 9 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 600 mV and the solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency (η) of 2.62% were achieved. The efficiency thus obtained was within the range (1.5%–2.7%) that was typically achieved for the cells based on 160–350 nm-sized monodispersed spherical ZnO aggregates without doping.40 After doping with boron, the JSC and η were significantly increased, reaching a maximum of up to 19.3 mA cm−2 and 6.75%, respectively. The highest η of the BZO cell corresponds to an increment of more than 100% of the un-doped ZnO cell. In addition, sample 1, with near perfect upright-standing nanosheets structure, achieved the highest short-circuit current density and, thus, the highest conversion efficiency, whereas sample 4, consisting of only ZnO nanocrystallites, presented the lowest current density and the lowest energy conversion efficiency among all four samples. The J–V curves have been measured more than 12 times for each un-doped ZnO and BZO sample and found to be excellently reproducible. Table 1 summarizes the open-circuit voltages, the short-circuit current densities, the fill factors (FF), and the overall energy conversion efficiencies for all four BZO samples and an un-doped ZnO sample (sample 5). All samples possessed the same or similar open-circuit voltages of approximately 600 mV, by considering that the VOC was generally determined by the difference between the Fermi level of the oxide semiconductor and the redox potential of the electrolyte. In addition, when the ZnO nanosheet films were doped with boron, the VOC slightly shifted to lower or higher values. It was concluded that the oxygen vacancy could influence the electron recombination reaction, but overall the influence on the VOC by the presence of boron (∼2 at.%) in the ZnO electrode is not clearly apparent. Moreover, the VOC of the DSSC is directly related to the concentration of electrons in the conduction band. It is mainly limited by recombination of conduction band electrons with I3− ions in the electrolyte and also oxidized dye molecules. The recombination of the conduction band electrons with oxidized dye molecules is negligible in this process and is significantly slower than the regeneration of the sensitizer by I−. Thus, the BZO film composed of standing nanosheets (sample 1) indicates that the recombination rate of the conduction band electrons is reduced. Therefore, the higher electron concentration in the conduction band and the reduction of recombination rate resulted in the improvement of the VOC. On the other hand, the short-circuit current density varied significantly from 19.3 mA cm−2 for sample 1 to 11.4 mA cm−2 for sample 4. As a result, the energy conversion efficiency varied systematically from 6.75% for sample 1 to 3.0% for sample 4, decreasing as the degree of standing of the nanosheets decreased. The dye loading of the films was measured to obtain the surface concentration of dye molecules adsorbed on BZO and un-doped ZnO nanosheet films in the present study. The result exhibited a slight decrease in the surface concentration, with the values of 6.56 × 10−8, 6.3 × 10−8, 5.9 × 10−8, and 4.7 × 10−8 mol cm−2 for the samples 1 through 4, respectively, when the film morphology has altered gradually from standing nanosheets to nanocrystallites, which may have different porosity and hence a different capability for dye adsorption. In addition, all four samples showed a specific surface area of 78 ± 2 m2 g−1. Similarly, the same trend is observed for un-doped ZnO nanosheet films with the values of 6.4 × 10−8, 6.0 × 10−8, 5.2 × 10−8, and 4.1 × 10−8 mol cm−2 for the samples 5 through 8, respectively, when the change in the film morphology is examined from upright-standing nanosheets to nanocrystallites formation. On the other hand, it was examined that almost an identical adsorption amount of dye was in the films before (6.4 × 10−8 mol cm−2) and after boron doping (6.56 × 10−8 mol cm−2), which is in good agreement with their analogous BET data (76.0 and 79 m2 g−1 for ZnO and BZO, respectively), as well as the film texture framework. In a DSSC, the current density is determined by the initial number of photogenerated carriers, the injection efficiency of the electrons from dye molecules to semiconductors, and the recombination rate between the injected electrons and oxidized dye or redox species in the electrolyte. It is reasonable to assume the same injection efficiency and recombination rate for the given ZnO/N3/electrolyte systems, so the initial number of photogenerated carriers may be significantly affected by the variation in the light-harvesting capability of photoelectrodes with different film structures. Thus, the performance enhancement of BZO cells can be reasonably inferred to be arising from the intrinsic components of the films, as well as the sunlight harvesting and photon-to-electron transfer process of the cells.

In order to optimize the performance of the counter electrode in this report, various counter electrodes were fabricated by sputtering platinum on FTO substrates for deposition periods of 5 to 160 s. With the increase of sputtering time, the transmittance of a counter electrode decreases, as shown in Fig. 7. Extra experiments were performed using SEM, an ellipsometer and an alpha-step profilometer for determining the thickness of Pt with sputtering times of 5 s to 160 s. However, it was examined that instead of thin film formation, the Pt formed islands even at a sputtering time of 160 s. This is consistent with the transmittance data presented in Fig. 7.
 Fig. 7  The transmittance spectra of counter electrodes, fabricated with different deposition times of platinum. 

Fig. 8 shows the J–V curves of un-doped ZnO and BZO nanosheet based DSSCs with a counter electrode of different Pt layers obtained at different deposition times, respectively. Table 2 exhibits the corresponding values of VOC, JSC, FF, and η. The JSC value reached a maximum at the deposition time of 10 s, and decreases steadily with increasing deposition period. The lesser value of JSC for the deposition time of less than 10 s may be attributed to insufficient catalytic ability of the very thin platinum layer, expected to form just for 5 s. On the other hand, for the deposition times from 10 s to 160 s, the continuous decrease of JSC is attributed to the decrease in transmittance with increasing Pt thickness (Fig. 7), which could hinder the incidence of light, and reduce dye excitation, thus leading to fewer injected electrons to the conduction band of ZnO.

To find out the reasons for a higher photocurrent result for a solar cell based on BZO, we measured incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) to study the photoactive wavelength regime for the un-doped and doped ZnO cells (Fig. 9a). Notably, IPCE data of the BZO cell shows a red shift, facilitating the utilization of sunlight in the full spectrum range. The maxima of IPCE in the visible region contributed by the dye absorption are located at approximately 520 nm with values of 91, 78, 65, and 55% for samples 1 through 4, respectively. That is, the IPCE obtained for the sample 1 film with standing nanosheets is almost 1.65 times that of the sample 4 films with only nanocrystallites. In addition, the great improvement in the IPCE suggests that the high energy conversion efficiencies result predominantly from light scattering by submicrometer sized ZnO nanosheets, which extends the distance that light travels within the photoelectrode film and provides the photons with more opportunities to be absorbed by the dye molecules. On the other hand, IPCE obtained for sample 1 is almost 2.11 times higher than the un-doped ZnO sample. Optical absorption spectra for BZO and un-doped ZnO films with dye sensitization reflect the difference in the light-harvesting capabilities of the films. The red shift was also observed in the UV-vis absorption spectroscopy measurements (Fig. 9b). Besides, the IPCE profile of BZO cell is found to be broadened and strengthened over the entire wavelength region, compared with that of the un-doped ZnO cell. The absorption spectra illustrate that the better standing nanosheets induce more effective photon capturing in the visible region and also suggest the existence of a strong light scattering effect. Such absorption originates from the dye molecules adsorbed on the ZnO surface and is related to the film structure. It has the highest intensity for sample 1, less intensity for samples 2 and 3, and the lowest intensity for sample 4. Such an effect may partially scatter the incident light and weaken the transmittance of the films and, thus, result in the pseudo absorption deviating from that of the adsorbed dye.

Another convincing aspect of this ZnO-based DSSC system is its high durability of the device performances as compared to other liquid junction solar cells. Generally, liquid junction solar cells encounter low stability due to the leakage currents, side reactions at the electrolyte/counter electrode interface and corrosion of quantum dots. In this regard, ZnO-based DSSC have advantages, such as the ability to operate at lower internal temperatures, being mechanically robust, the ability to work at wider angles, robustness to corrosion, air stability, and nonvolatility. Fig. 10 exhibits the cell performance durability for 41 days. The un-doped ZnO and BZO nanosheet-based cell performance was measured every 7 days with air, and the results indicated that it was not degraded even after 41 days. The dependence of the current density, open circuit voltage, fill factor and the overall conversion efficiency on the time duration exhibited the decrease of only ∼4 to 5% after 41 days. Due to the high stability for the cell performances of our BZO nanosheets based DSSC they possess great potential as a next generation solar cell.

4 Conclusions
In conclusion, the well-stacked up-right standing ZnO and BZO nanoporous nanosheets have been demonstrated as an effective approach to generate light scattering within the photoelectrode film of DSSCs while retaining the desired specific surface area for dye-molecule adsorption. Thus the deposited BZO nanosheets are perpendicular to the substrate, with a macroporous structure, and are distributed uniformly on the substrate in a regular fashion (SEM). The maximum energy conversion efficiency of 6.75% was achieved on photoelectrode films that consisted of well stacked up-right standing nanosheets of BZO. This efficiency is a more than 100% increase over the 2.62% achieved for un-doped ZnO films. Optimization of the sputter deposition time of platinum on the counter electrode rendered 10 s the best value to achieve the highest efficiency. The superior performance of the DSSC with ZnO nanosheets, with reference to that of the cell with ZnO nanocrystallites is attributed to the higher IPCE, higher dye-loading, and longer electron lifetime of the cell with ZnO nanosheets, compared to those of the cell with ZnO nanocrystallites. In addition, the IPCE spectra of the BZO cell exhibited a significant enhancement in light harvesting, especially in the visible region. Moreover, the great improvement in the IPCE suggests that the high energy conversion efficiencies result predominantly from light scattering by submicrometer sized ZnO nanosheets, which extends the distance that light travels within the photoelectrode film and provides the photons with more opportunities to be absorbed by the dye molecules. The fabricated cell exhibited remarkable durability in cell performance; the cell efficiency decreased by only a few % in air over 40 days. Therefore, BZO may be developed as a promising photoelectrode material for high-efficiency DSSCs. This method is anticipated to be equally applicable to other semiconductor photoelectrodes in DSSCs and organic–inorganic hybrid solar cells.
