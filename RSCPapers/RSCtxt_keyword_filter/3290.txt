    , Accepted 18th March 2021First published on 18th March 2021AbstractAll-inorganic perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have attracted intensive attention owing to their tunable bandgaps and excellent photo- and thermostability, making them promising absorbers in tandem solar cells (TSCs). Herein, we develop an all-inorganic perovskite/organic TSC with a wide bandgap all-inorganic perovskite CsPbI2.1Br0.9 and a narrow bandgap organic photoactive layer (PM6:Y6) serving as top and bottom sub cells respectively. The fabricated tandem solar cell demonstrated a remarkable PCE of 18.06%, with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.89 V, short-circuit current (JSC) of 12.77 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 74.81%, which is higher than that of both single junction PVSCs (14.43%) and organic solar cells (14.01%). Moreover, benefiting from the outstanding UV and thermal stability of inorganic perovskites, all-inorganic perovskite-based tandem devices showed superior stability under light and heat, with negligible degradation after 150 h of UV irradiation, 250 h under one sun illumination and 100 h of heating at 80 °C. This work demonstrates that all-inorganic perovskites are an appropriate candidate for the fabrication of efficient and stable TSCs.
1. Introduction
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PVSCs), as one of the most promising photovoltaic (PV) technologies, have thrived expeditiously in the past decade by achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 25%.1–5 Further commercialization of PVSCs requires considerately enhanced PCE and stability.6 However, the Shockley–Queisser (S–Q) limit demonstrates that the theoretical maximum PCE of single-junction PVSCs can only reach a value of 33.7% with a 1.34 eV bandgap perovskite absorber.7,8 To break the S–Q limit, tandem solar cells (TSCs) have been developed to mitigate energy losses originating from the thermalization of charge carriers.9,10
Perovskite-based TSCs, which combine wide bandgap perovskites with narrow bandgap photoactive materials, such as silicon and copper indium gallium selenide (Cu(InxGa1−x)Se2, CIGS), have achieved high PCEs over 29%.11–14 Although perovskite/silicon and perovskite/CIGS tandem solar cells have achieved high performance, the cost of silicon and CIGS cells is relatively high due to expensive raw materials and energy-consuming fabrication processes.15 Moreover, the rigid nature of silicon films limits their application in flexible substrates.16 As an alternative, perovskite/perovskite TSCs have emerged due to their low cost and compatibility for the fabrication of large-area flexible devices.17,18 Recently, considerable efforts on perovskite/perovskite TSCs have been made through optimizing the narrow bandgap Sn/Pb perovskite to achieve over 25% PCEs.19,20 However, several unignorable drawbacks still prohibit their development.21,22 Firstly, the Sn2+ in narrow bandgap perovskites can be easily oxidized to Sn4+, further reducing the stability of tandem devices.23 Secondly, high boiling point polar solvents (such as DMF and DMSO) are inevitably required when depositing narrow bandgap perovskite films.24 Therefore, a compact and robust recombination layer (RL) must be designed and fabricated to provide resistance against the penetration of solvents.25 To meet this demand, thermal sputtering or atomic layer deposition (ALD) is needed to prepare a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) or SnO2 layer. However, the sputtering and ALD techniques rely on vacuum conditions which leads to additional energy-consuming processes, not to mention increasing the complexity of device fabrication.
Apart from narrow bandgap perovskites, organic solar cells (OSCs) are widely employed to fabricate TSCs due to their tunable bandgap, high absorption coefficient, low-temperature solution-processed fabrication and compatibility with flexible substrates.26–28 The hydrophobic property of organic layers with higher stability than Sn/Pb perovskites will be suitable to fabricate efficient and stable perovskite/organic TSCs.29–34 Moreover, perovskite/organic tandem solar cells can be fabricated via solution processing using orthogonal solvents, which has large potential for large-scale roll-to-roll production.35–37 Therefore, perovskite/organic TSCs have been proved as a potential candidate to achieve stable and flexible solution-processed TSCs.38 In order to realize long-term stability of perovskite/organic TSCs, all-inorganic perovskites demonstrate superior photostability and thermal stability toward widely used organic–inorganic perovskites, which are much more promising candidates as sub cells for stable TSCs.39 Recently, several groups have reported and reviewed the successful fabrication of all-inorganic perovskite/organic TSCs.40,41 For example, Lang et al. have fabricated perovskite/organic TSCs by employing CsPbI2Br and PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F as the top and bottom absorbers respectively, and achieved an efficiency of 17.24%.42 Xie et al. have achieved an efficiency of 18.38% by integrating CsPbI2Br with PM6:Y6 to construct tandem devices.43 Although high efficiencies were reported, the stability of such devices haven't been studied, which requires systematic investigation.
In this work, a stable and efficient all-inorganic perovskite sub cell with 1.79 eV bandgap was fabricated by phenmethylammonium chloride (PMACl) passivation. A perovskite–organic tandem solar cell with a device configuration of ITO/SnO2/CsPbI2.1Br0.9/PBDB-T/MoO3/ultrathin Ag/ZnO NPs/PM6:Y6/MoO3/Ag was fabricated, which showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.06%, with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.89 V, short-circuit current (JSC) of 12.77 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 74.81%. Most importantly, the as-prepared all-inorganic perovskite-based TSCs showed superior stability to the commonly used organic/inorganic hybrid perovskite-based devices and showed negligible degradation after 150 h of UV irradiation, 250 h under one sun illumination and 100 h of heating at 80 °C. This work demonstrates that all-inorganic perovskites can be a promising candidate to fabricate efficient tandem cells with excellent long-term stability.
2. Results and discussion
To develop highly efficient and stable perovskite/OSC TSCs, we firstly fabricated single-junction PVSCs with the all-inorganic perovskite CsPbI2.1Br0.9. The perovskite was deposited according to our previous work.44,45 As the commonly used spiro-OMeTAD is readily dissolved by the solution of PM6:Y6 in chloroform (CF) when depositing OSC sub cells, we replaced it with a polymer, PBDB-T, which is robust enough and remains intact in the process of fabricating tandem devices due to its lower solubility in CF. The chemical structures of PM6, Y6 and PBDB-T are shown in Fig. S1.† The configuration of perovskite single-junction cell was designed to be ITO/SnO2/CsPbI2.1Br0.9/PBDB-T/MoO3/Ag. Since the severe energy loss of this all-inorganic PVSC limits its performance, we employed phenmethylammonium chloride (PMACl) as a passivation agent to modify the surface of the perovskite (Fig. 1a).

The current density–voltage (J–V) curves for the champion devices with (denoted as Cs-PMACl) and without PMACl (denoted as Cs-Ref) are shown in Fig. 1b, with the corresponding photovoltaic parameters summarized in Table S1.† The Cs-Ref devices exhibited a champion PCE of 13.27%, with a VOC of 1.07 V, JSC of 15.40 mA cm−2, and FF of 80.52%. After treatment with PMACl solution (2.5 mg mL−1), the photovoltaic performance was improved to achieve a champion PCE of 14.43%, with a considerable VOC of 1.15 V, JSC of 15.46 mA cm−2 and FF of 81.19%. The noticeably enhanced VOC can be ascribed to the alleviated non-radiative recombination. The slightly strange shape of J–V curves for PBDB-T-based devices may be due to the unique charge transport properties of PBDB-T; similar results can be observed in previous literature.46 The J–V curves of the champion device with forward and reverse scan are shown in Fig. S2,† which indicated a negligible hysteresis. The integrated JSC values determined from the EQE spectra were 14.82 and 14.87 mA cm−2 for the Cs-Ref and Cs-PMACl devices (Fig. S3†), respectively, agreeing well with the value from J–V measurements. The relatively low EQE value in the range of 550 nm to 750 nm originates from the thin perovskite layer of 200 nm, which is designed for current matching in the tandem device. Devices with spiro-OMeTAD as the hole-transporting material were also fabricated to confirm the effectiveness of PMACl passivation. As shown in Fig. S4,† PMACl treatment results in an enhancement of VOC from 1.07 V to 1.20 V. The J–V curves of devices treated with PMACl solution of different concentrations (0 mg mL−1, 1 mg mL−1, 2.5 mg mL−1, and 5.0 mg mL−1) are shown in Fig. S5† and Table S1.† The concentration of 2.5 mg mL−1 resulted in the best performance, which is employed to fabricate single-junction and tandem devices hereafter.
To further study the mechanism of PMACl passivation, the UV-vis absorption, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were measured. Fig. S6a† shows the UV-vis absorbance spectra of Cs-Ref and Cs-PMACl perovskite films, which indicate that the PMACl treatment doesn't influence the absorption of perovskite films. The bandgap of the as-prepared perovskite is determined to be 1.79 eV (Fig. S6b†). Fig. S7† exhibits the PL spectra of Cs-Ref and Cs-PMACl perovskite films; it is observed that the Cs-PMACl film showed obviously higher PL intensity than the Cs-Ref film, suggesting the alleviated non-radiative recombination by PMACl passivation. What's more, a blue shift of the PL peak from 689 nm to 684 nm can be noted, possibly due to the reduced shallow defects on the perovskite grain boundaries and surfaces.47 The TRPL results in Fig. 1c and Table S2† demonstrated the average PL lifetime (τave) of Cs-Ref and Cs-PMACl perovskite films to be 7.81 ns and 16.13 ns, respectively, confirming the alleviated non-radiative recombination via PMACl passivation.
Apart from the device performance, the stability of perovskites is also essential as large bandgap mixed halide perovskites tend to show phase segregation under continuous illumination. To test the stability, we firstly measured the PL and UV-vis spectra of perovskites with different compositions before and after one sun illumination for different times. As shown in Fig. 1d, the PL peak of the Cs-Ref perovskite film showed a slight broadening, which was possibly attributed to the slight phase segregation. For the Cs-PMACl film (Fig. 1e), the PL peak remained unchanged and there was no broadening of the peak after illumination for 60 min, indicating that the Cs-PMACl perovskite is extremely stable without any phase segregation. This enhancement in stability may result from the suppression of halide migration.48 The UV-vis absorption spectra in Fig. S8a and b† showed similar results, with the PMACl passivated perovskite showing superior photostability.
To compare the photostability of all-inorganic perovskites with that of organic/inorganic hybrid perovskites for TSCs, we also measured the PL and UV-vis absorption spectra of the organic/inorganic hybrid perovskite FA0.8Cs0.2Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 (denoted as FACs) after illumination for different times. The FACs perovskite showed a bandgap of 1.78 eV according to the measured absorption and Tauc plot (Fig. S9a and b†). As shown in Fig. 1f, there is a notable red shift of the PL peak after illumination for more than 5 min, indicating that the photo-induced phase segregation happened.13 The PL intensity was also enhanced with a red shift, which has been reported before that the carriers tend to be concentrated into smaller bandgap emitters in a multiphase perovskite film, leading to an increased local excitation intensity within small bandgap grains and resulting in high PL intensity on the long-wavelength side.49 Fig. S8c† shows the change of absorption spectra of the FACs perovskite under one sun illumination, and the depletion of the ∼670 nm absorption with a simultaneous increase in the absorption at higher wavelengths also suggests that the perovskite undergoes phase segregation.49 Therefore, it can be concluded that the all-inorganic perovskite had superior stability under illumination than the FACs perovskite, which is a better choice for the fabrication of stable single junction and tandem devices.
Besides, we compared the stability of single-junction devices with different perovskite compositions. FACs-based devices were fabricated with the structure of ITO/SnO2/FA0.8Cs0.2Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3/PBDB-T/MoO3/Ag and showed a champion efficiency of 13.13%, with a VOC of 1.19 V, JSC of 15.50 mA cm−2, and FF of 71.20% (Fig. 1g and S9b†), close to that of the Cs-Ref device. The stable output (SPO) of champion Cs-Ref, Cs-PMACl, and FACs-based devices at the MPP under simulated one sun illumination was recorded (Fig. 1h). The Cs-PMACl device exhibited excellent stability with no obvious decay of efficiency for 500 seconds. The Cs-Ref device showed slight degradation after 500 second illumination. In contrast, the FACs-based device showed poor stability; the efficiency decreased dramatically from 13.07% to 11.24% after illumination for 500 s. Meanwhile, Cs-PMACl and FACs-based devices were also set under continuous one sun illumination in a N2 glove box for aging; Fig. 1i showed that the Cs-PMACl based device retained over 85% of its initial efficiency after irradiation for 100 hours. By contrast, the efficiency of the FACs-based device rapidly decayed after 60 hours. Hence, we can conclude that the all-inorganic perovskite is appropriate for the fabrication of perovskite/OSC TSCs owing to the high performance and excellent intrinsic photostability.
Subsequently, we combined the 1.79 eV Cs-PMACl perovskite with ∼1.30 eV narrow bandgap OSC (PM6:Y6) to fabricate tandem devices. Perovskite/OSC TSCs with the structure of ITO/SnO2 (20 nm)/CsPbI2.1Br0.9 (180 nm)/PMACl/PBDB-T (20 nm)/MoO3 (6 nm)/Ag (1 nm)/ZnO NP (50 nm)/PM6:Y6 (110 nm)/MoO3 (10 nm)/Ag (100 nm) (Fig. 2a) were designed and fabricated. One of the crucial issues for the fabrication of TSCs is to maintain the underlayer films intact when depositing another layer. In this configuration, the ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized according to previous reports and dispersed in isopropanol (IPA),50 which is an orthogonal solvent of perovskite. Meanwhile, the mixture of PM6:Y6 (1:1.2) was dissolved in chloroform (CF), which has a low boiling point and evaporates rapidly after dripping, avoiding the damage to the underlayer robust PBDB-T. The cross-section SEM image in Fig. S10† confirmed the intact structure of the fabricated tandem devices. To meet the requirement of current matching of two sub cells according to Kirchhoff's law, we tuned the perovskite and interconnecting layer (ICL) with proper transparency. The transmittance spectra of the ICL and the front cell/ICL are shown in Fig. S11a and b,† respectively, which showed over 80% transmission in the near-infrared region, which guarantees the light absorption of the organic bottom cell. Meanwhile, the ultra-thin 1 nm silver can effectively form ohmic contact with the adjacent charge-selective layer for carrier recombination. Besides, the thickness of the perovskite and PM6:Y6 was tuned to achieve current matching; Fig. S12† presents the J–V and EQE curves of TSCs with the thickness of PM6:Y6 ranging from 80 to 140 nm and the thickness of the perovskite ranging from 110 to 250 nm, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S3,† which showed that when the thicknesses of the perovskite and PM6:Y6 are 180 nm and 110 nm respectively, the current matches. The J–V curves of the champion tandem devices and sub cells are plotted in Fig. 2b and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The single-junction OSCs showed a champion efficiency of 14.01%, with a VOC of 0.83 V, JSC of 24.75 mA cm−2, and FF of 68.18%. The fabricated champion perovskite/organic tandem device showed a PCE of 18.06% with a VOC of 1.89 V, JSC of 12.77 mA cm−2, and FF of 74.81%. The high VOC confirms the effectiveness of PMACl passivation and well-realized interconnecting layer. The increased FF of tandem devices compared to single-junction OSCs may be attributed to the increased FF under lower light intensities due to the reduced carrier concentrations.51 The champion tandem device exhibited a negligible hysteresis of J–V curves with forward and reverse scan (Fig. S13†).

Fig. 2c shows the EQE of two single-junction sub cells; both the two sub cells showed considerable EQE values, with an integrated JSC of 14.87 mA cm−2 and 23.57 mA cm−2, respectively, consistent with the JSC obtained from J–V measurements. The high EQE values are beneficial for the enhancement of light absorption in TSCs. Fig. 2d shows the EQE spectra of the two sub cells operating in the tandem device, in which the two sub cells showed appropriate current matching with a high EQE value between 300 nm and 950 nm. The integrated current densities of top and bottom cells are 12.32 mA cm−2 and 12.12 mA cm−2, which is consistent with the JSC obtained from J–V curves. The SPO of the as-prepared TSC was also recorded at the MPP under simulated AM1.5G illumination for 1200 seconds, which exhibited a stabilized efficiency of 17.96% (Fig. 2e) at a voltage of 1.57 V, demonstrating excellent stability under working condition. Fig. 2f shows the PCE statistics of 30 tandem devices; the efficiencies manifested a normal distribution, indicating the excellent reproducibility of tandem devices. The statistical distribution of VOC, JSC and FF is shown in Fig. S14a–c†, which also showed good reproducibility.
To gain deeper insight into the origin of device performance, we quantitatively analyzed the energy loss from sub cells and explained how the tandem structure improves the device performance.52 The energy loss analysis results of the single-junction PVSCs and OSCs are shown in Fig. 3a and b, with corresponding energy loss values summarized in Table S3.† As demonstrated, the transmission loss of the perovskite single-junction cell (53.34 mW cm−2) is significantly larger than that of the OSC single-junction cell (30.44 mW cm−2), which is due to its much larger bandgap and poorer coverage of the solar spectrum. The large bandgap also results in much smaller thermalization loss in the PVSC (8.47 mW cm−2) than in the OSC (15.93 mW cm−2), as less photons with an energy above the bandgap of the perovskite are absorbed. Although the OSC shows smaller average VOC,loss than perovskite solar cells, the total converted energy of the OSC (13.30 mW cm−2) is still lower than that of the PVSC (13.53 mW cm−2), which is mainly attributed to the severe thermalization loss and insufficient light absorption. Therefore, balancing the transmission loss and thermalization loss is crucial for the enhancement of device performance in a solar cell. However, it remains difficult to simultaneously cut down both losses in single-junction solar cells, as the bandgap of the semiconducting material has already determined the pathways of both losses.

In the tandem structure (Fig. 3c, Table S4†), the transmission loss is the same as in the OSC device due to identical absorption onset. However, the thermalization loss of the tandem device is suppressed compared with that of single-junction OSCs. The total thermalization loss of the tandem cell (12.46 mW cm−2) is significantly reduced compared with that of the OSC device (15.93 mW cm−2) due to suppressed carrier thermalization. The larger total thermalization loss of the tandem device than the PVSC is attributed to the larger number of photons absorbed in tandem devices. To better compare the thermalization energy loss without the influence from the absorbed photon number, the averaged thermalization loss per electron (Etherm/Nelectrons) was introduced and calculated. The average Etherm of the tandem device (0.51 eV) is obviously smaller than that of the single-junction PVSC (0.57 eV) and OSC (0.68 eV), indicating that the tandem structure can effectively alleviate the thermalization loss. Besides, the energy loss of the tandem device caused by non-absorbed photons and IQE loss are also alleviated compared to OSC devices, perhaps due to the enhanced light absorption and improved total EQE. Fig. 3d depicts the wavelength dependent energy conversion; the tandem device showed improved efficiency due to the enhanced photo-response in the range of 300–700 nm and reduced thermalization due to the complementary light absorption. To conclude, the tandem structure efficiently balanced the transmission loss and thermalization loss, leading to improved device performance.
Moreover, the energy loss analysis also confirmed the great potential of the perovskite/organic tandem structure to achieve higher performance than single-junction solar cells due to the simultaneously reduced transition loss and thermalization loss. The resultant unsatisfactory efficiency of 18.06% is mainly attributed to the severe VOC,loss and carrier dynamic loss caused by the two sub cells and interconnecting layer. Further reduction of VOC,loss of the two sub cells, development of wide-bandgap perovskites and narrow-bandgap organic absorbers with more well-matched light absorption, and continuous optimization of interconnecting layers will make it promising to achieve a PCE over 20%.
Stability is also an important issue for the commercialization of photovoltaic technology. As mentioned above, OSCs have been reported to be unstable under UV-light irradiation;53 in contrast, all-inorganic PVSCs have demonstrated the most promising intrinsic stability under illumination. Fig. 1h has proved that all-inorganic PVSCs used in this work have superior stability under UV light, which is supposed to enhance the stability of the tandem device. The mechanism is depicted in Fig. 4a. In the tandem devices, the UV light was absorbed by the all-inorganic perovskite front cell, protecting the OSC bottom cells from UV irradiation. As a result, the device became stable under UV light. To verify this hypothesis, we set the fabricated all-inorganic PVSC, OSC, and TSC under 365 nm UV irradiation in a N2 glovebox for aging. The devices were measured every 25 hours to record the efficiency evolution. As shown in Fig. 4b, the PCE of the OSC device decayed rapidly to less than 50% of its original value after 150 hours. In contrast, the all-inorganic PVSC device and tandem device were quite stable and retained over 90% of their original efficiencies, confirming that the all-inorganic PVSCs can act as a window to filter the UV light and contribute to a stable OSC-based TSC.

To contrast the stability of PVSC/OSC TSCs with different perovskites, we also fabricated tandem devices with the FACs-based perovskite with the same configuration. Fig. S15† shows the device structure, J–V curve of the champion device and corresponding EQE spectra. The photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S5.† The FACs-based TSCs showed a champion efficiency of 16.53%, with a VOC of 1.84 V, JSC of 12.53 mA cm−2, and FF of 71.72%, confirming the effectiveness of this tandem structure. As shown in Fig. 1h and i, the CsPbI2.1Br0.9-based TSCs were supposed to show better stability than the FA0.8Cs0.2Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 based tandem device. We compared the stability of the all-inorganic perovskite CsPbI2.1Br0.9-based tandem device (denoted as Cs-TSC) with that of the organic/inorganic hybrid FA0.8Cs0.2Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 (denoted as FACs-TSC) (Fig. 5a–c). The Cs-TSCs showed superior stability to FACs-TSC under both 365 nm UV irradiation and one sun illumination, retaining over 90% of their initial PCE after aging (Fig. 5a and b). In contrast, FACs-TSCs swiftly decayed to less than 60% of their original efficiencies, indicating that all-inorganic perovskite-based TSCs have better photostability. Besides, as the all-inorganic perovskites are theoretically more stable than those with organic cations due to the volatile nature of organic cations, we also compared the thermal stability of the Cs-TSC and FACs-TSC at 80 °C under a N2 atmosphere. As depicted in Fig. 5c, the Cs-TSC retained over 85% of its initial PCE after heating at 80 °C for 100 hours. However, the FACs-TSC demonstrated poor stability; the efficiency of the FACs-TSC decreased to less than 50% of its original value after annealing for 100 hours. The stability results suggest that all-inorganic perovskites are a better choice to fabricate stable tandem devices.

The PbI2·xDMAI complex was synthesized following our previous report.44,45 ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized according to a previous report.50 Generally, the solution of KOH (1.48 g in 65 mL methanol) was slowly dripped into the Zn(Ac)2·2H2O solution (2.95 g in 125 mL methanol) under vigorous stirring in 10 min. After 3 h, the heater and stirrer were stopped to allow the nanoparticles to precipitate for about 5 h. After separating the precipitate and mother liquor, the precipitate was washed twice with methanol. Then the suspension was unstirred for 5 h to reach complete precipitation. The washed precipitate was dispersed in IPA (10 mL) for further use.
3.2 Device fabrication

Solution preparation. 
The SnO2 solution was prepared by diluting the SnO2 colloid precursor with deionized H2O (v/v = 1:5). CsPbI2.1Br0.9 solution was prepared by dissolving CsI (78 mg, 0.3 mmol), xDMAI·PbI2 (105 mg, 0.165 mmol) and PbBr2 (49.55 mg, 0.135 mmol) in 550 μL anhydrous DMF and stirred for 2 hours before use. FA0.8Cs0.2Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 solution was prepared by dissolving FAI (148.52 mg, 0.864 mmol), CsI (56.16 mg, 0.216 mmol), PbI2 (273.83 mg, 0.594 mmol) and PbBr2 (178.36 mg, 0.486 mmol) in 360 μL anhydrous DMSO and 1080 μL anhydrous DMF. PMACl solution with different concentrations was prepared by dissolving different weights of PMACl in IPA. For the HTL solution, 5 mg PBDB-T was dissolved in 1 mL anhydrous CB. OPV active layer solutions (PM6:Y6, 1:1.2) were prepared based on our previous reports by dissolving 8 mg PM6 and 9.6 mg Y6 in 1 mL chloroform with 1% (vol%) 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) as an additive.54


Single-junction perovskite device fabrication. 
ITO substrates were cleaned with detergent, deionized water, acetone, isopropanol and ethanol for 15 min, respectively. The cleaned ITO substrates were treated with UV ozone for 30 min before use. SnO2 solution was spin-coated on the ITO substrates at 5000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 150 °C for 30 min, then the substrates were transferred into a dry air glove box. 40 μL CsPbI2.9Br0.1 perovskite solution was spin-coated on the glass/ITO/SnO2 substrate at 2000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 170 °C for 10 min. Then, the glass/SnO2/perovskite substrates were transferred into a N2 glove box. PMACl with different concentrations in IPA was spin-coated onto the CsPbI2.9Br0.1 film at 6000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 5 min. Sequentially, IPA was spin-coated on the surface at 6000 rpm for 30 s, and annealed at 100 °C for another 5 min. To deposit the HTL, 20 μL PBDB-T solution was spin-coated on ITO/SnO2/CsPbI2.1Br0.9/PMACl at 1500 rpm for 30 s. Ultimately, 6 nm MoO3 and 100 nm Ag were thermally evaporated.


Single-junction wide-bandgap FA0.8Cs0.2Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3-based device fabrication. 
The glass/ITO/SnO2 substrate was processed by the procedures mentioned above. After transferring the substrates into a N2 glovebox, 40 μL FA0.8Cs0.2Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 solution was spin coated on the glass/ITO/SnO2 substrate at 5000 rpm for 30 s. 200 μL CB was dripped onto the film at 7 s before the end of spin-coating. Then PBDB-T, MoO3 and Ag were deposited with the same procedures mentioned above.


Single junction OSC device fabrication. 
An ITO glass substrate was treated with the same procedures mentioned above, and then the substrate was transferred to a N2 glovebox. A 30 nm ZnO film was deposited on the ITO by spin-coating the dispersion of ZnO in IPA. The active layer (PM6:Y6) solution was dynamically spin-coated onto the substrates at 2000 rpm for 60 s. Eventually, 10 nm MoO3 and 100 nm Ag were thermally evaporated.


Tandem device fabrication. 
The glass/ITO/SnO2 substrate was processed by the procedures mentioned above. Then the CsPbI2.9Br0.1 and FA0.8Cs0.2Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 perovskites and PBDB-T were deposited by the procedures mentioned above respectively. Afterwards, 6 nm MoO3 and 1 nm Ag were evaporated onto the PBDB-T layer. Then, 50 nm ZnO was spin-coated on the silver. Subsequently, the PM6:Y6 active layer, MoO3 (10 nm) and Ag (100 nm) were deposited with the same procedures mentioned above.

3.3 Characterization

J–V characteristics of single-junction and tandem devices were measured in a N2 glovebox using a Keithley 2400 source meter under simulated AM 1.5G illumination from a solar simulator (Enlitech, SS-F5, Taiwan). A National Renewable Energy Laboratory calibrated silicon solar cell with a KG2 filter was used to calibrate the intensity of light from the solar simulator. A QE-R EQE system (EnLi Technology, Taiwan), light biased with an L700 filter (for the top cell) and an S550 filter (for the bottom cell) were employed to measure the EQE of tandem devices. PL and TRPL results were recorded with an FLS980 spectrofluorometer (Edinburgh). The samples for PL and TRPL measurements were all formed on the glass/ITO/SnO2 substrate. UV-vis absorption spectra were measured with a UV-vis spectrometer (PerkinElmer model Lambda 2S). The thicknesses of films were measured using a DektakXT Profiler (Bruker). The cross-section image of tandem solar cells was obtained by scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Quattro S) with a pulsed excitation laser at a wavelength of 405 nm.
3.4 Energy loss analysis
The energy loss calculation follows a previous work.51,52
(1) The transmission loss was calculated by  where Φ(hν) is the solar energy spectrum, Eg is the band gap of the solar cell system, and hν is the photon energy.
(2) Insufficient light absorbing loss can be calculated by  where the EQE (100% IQE, hν) is the EQE of the device assuming that the device IQE is 100%, which can be estimated from the optical simulation and reflectance spectra.
(3) Thermalization energy loss can be calculated by  
(4) VOCloss can be calculated by  
(5) IQE loss can be calculated by  
(6) FF loss can be calculated by  
(7) Combining Eabs and EIQE  
4. Conclusions
We have successfully fabricated tandem solar cells with all-inorganic perovskites and organic absorbers as top and bottom sub cells respectively. The tandem devices with the passivated CsPbI2.1Br0.9 perovskite and narrow bandgap OSC active layer (PM6:Y6) have realized a remarkable PCE of 18.06%, with a VOC of 1.89 V, JSC of 12.77 mA cm−2, and FF of 74.81%. The all-inorganic perovskite CsPbI2.1Br0.9 showed superior photostability to the organic/inorganic hybrid perovskite FA0.8Cs0.2Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3, without phase segregation observed under one sun illumination. Therefore, the stable all-inorganic perovskite front cell can act as a window layer to absorb high-energy UV light to protect the UV-unstable bottom organic solar cells. The tandem device showed excellent stability under one sun illumination, UV irradiation and 80 °C heating under a N2 atmosphere, respectively; in comparison, the organic/inorganic hybrid perovskite-based tandem device exhibited obvious degradation. To conclude, we have systematically studied the stability and performance of all-inorganic perovskite/organic tandem solar cells, which proves that all-inorganic perovskites are more promising candidates than organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites for the fabrication of efficient and stable tandem solar cells.
