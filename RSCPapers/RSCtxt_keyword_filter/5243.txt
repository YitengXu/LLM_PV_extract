    , Accepted 2nd November 2010First published on 6th December 2010AbstractFour small band gap semiconducting copolymers based on electron deficient diketopyrrolopyrrole alternating with electron rich trimers containing furan and benzene or thiophene have been synthesized via Suzuki polymerization. The polymers have optical band gaps between 1.4 and 1.6 eV, optimized for solar energy conversion, and exhibit ambipolar charge transport in field-effect transistors with hole and electron mobilities higher than 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1. In solar cells the polymers are used as electron donors and provide power conversion efficiencies up to 3.7% in simulated solar light when mixed with [70]PCBM as acceptor.
Introduction
While thiophene is a well-explored and extremely versatile building block in conjugated polymers, its oxygen analogue, furan, has received much less attention.1–4 Furan derivatives can be obtained from natural sources,5 and hence polymers based on furan have been considered as a step towards renewable polymers. Furan has a higher oxidation potential and is less aromatic than thiophene. The optical absorption of oligofurans is somewhat blue shifted compared to oligothiophenes,6,7 but copolymers based on zinc porphyrin and furan or thiophene display similar optical band gaps.8 Furan units have been also incorporated into electrochemically synthesized furan–arene–furan conjugated polymers and their optical and electrochemical properties have been investigated.9 First-principles calculations have revealed that the bandwidths and intrinsic charge carrier mobility for oligofurans and oligothiophenes can be quite comparable.10 These characteristics suggest that furan may be an interesting building block in semiconducting materials for optoelectronic applications such as field-effect transistors and solar cells.
We have recently shown that with easily accessible polymers based on 3,6-di-2-thienyl-1,4-diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole copolymerized with 2,5-thienylene or 1,4-phenylene to PDPP-TTT and PDPP-TPT (Scheme 1), power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 5.5% can be obtained in bulk heterojunction solar cells with phenyl C71-butyric methyl ester ([70]PCBM) while the pure polymers show ambipolar transport in field-effect transistors with high mobility.11,12 In exploring the DPP structural motif for conjugated polymers, we were interested in assessing furan as a building block in the main chain and synthesized four new copolymers (PDPP-XYX) that have DPP units alternating along the chain with conjugated segments that consist of three aromatic rings (XYX) consisting of 2,5-furanylene (F) with 2,5-thienylene (T) or 1,4-phenylene (P) (Scheme 1). The new polymers are compared to PDPP-TTT and PDPP-TPT described recently.11,12 It will be shown that furan based polymers exhibit ambipolar charge transport in field-effect transistors (FET) with almost balanced electron and hole mobilities that can exceed 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1. Solar cells made with the furan polymers gave a PCE up to 3.7% with [70]PCBM as acceptor. Comparison with PDPP-TTT suggests that the PCE is probably limited by the molecular weight that has been obtained.
 Scheme 1  Structures of the new PDPP-XYX polymers: PDPP-FPF, PDPP-FFF, PDPP-FTF, and PDPP-TFT together with the structures of PDPP-TPT and PDPP-TTT described in ref 11 and 12. 
Experimental
All reactions were conducted under an argon atmosphere. Commercial chemicals were used as received. [70]PCBM was purchased from Solenne BV. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 400 MHz and 100 MHz, respectively on a VARIAN mercury spectrometer with CDCl3 as the solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard unless specified otherwise. The peaks are given in ppm, relative to TMS (0 ppm). Molecular weights were determined with GPC at 80 °C on a PL-GPC 120 system using a PL-GEL 5µ MIXED-C column and o-DCB as the eluent. Polystyrene standards were used.
UV-vis-near IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 900 spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry was conducted under an inert atmosphere with a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1, using 1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate in o-DCB as the electrolyte. The working electrode was a platinum disk and the counter electrode was a silver rod electrode. Fc/Fc+ was used as an internal standard.
Field-effect transistors were fabricated using heavily doped silicon wafers as the common gate electrode with a 200 nm thermally oxidized SiO2 layer as the gate dielectric. Using conventional photolithography, gold source and drain electrodes were defined in a bottom contact device configuration with a channel length of 10 µm and different widths. A 10 nm layer of titanium was used acting as an adhesion layer for the gold on SiO2. The SiO2 layer was exposed to the vapour of the primer hexamethyldisilazane for 60 min prior to semiconductor deposition in order to passivate the surface of the gate dielectric. Films were spun from a chloroform solution at 1500 rpm for 30 s. Freshly prepared devices were annealed in a dynamic vacuum of 10−5 mbar at 100 °C for 72 h to remove traces of solvent. All electrical measurements were performed in vacuum using an HP 4155C semiconductor parameter analyzer.
Photovoltaic devices were made by spin coating poly(ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Clevios P, VP Al4083) onto pre-cleaned, patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates (14 Ω per square) (Naranjo Substrates). The photoactive layer was deposited by spin coating a chloroform solution containing 6 mg ml−1 polymer and 12 mg ml−1 [70]PCBM (9 and 9 mg ml−1 for FFF) and an appropriate amount of 1,8-diiodooctane as described in the text. The counter electrode, consisting of LiF (1 nm) and Al (100 nm), was deposited by vacuum evaporation at ∼3 × 10−7 mbar. The active area of the cells was 0.091 cm2. J–V characteristics were measured under ∼100 mW cm−2 white light from a tungsten–halogen lamp filtered by a Schott GG385 UV filter and a Hoya LB120 daylight filter, using a Keithley 2400 source meter. Short-circuit currents under AM1.5G conditions were estimated from the spectral response and convolution with the solar spectrum. The spectral response was measured under simulated 1 sun operation conditions using bias light from a 532 nm solid state laser (Edmund Optics). Monochromatic light from a 50 W tungsten halogen lamp (Philips focusline) in combination with monochromator (Oriel, Cornerstone 130) was modulated with a mechanical chopper. The response was recorded as the voltage over a 50 Ω resistance, using a lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research Systems SR830). A calibrated Si cell was used as reference. The device was kept behind a quartz window in a nitrogen filled container. The thickness of the active layers in the photovoltaic devices was measured on a Veeco Dektak150 profilometer. Tapping mode AFM was measured on an MFP-3D (Asylum research) using PPP-NCHR probes (Nanosensors).

This mixture was stirred for 3 days at 115 °C after which the crude polymer was precipitated in methanol. The solids were filtered over a Büchner funnel and re-dissolved in chloroform (80 ml) and stirred under reflux with 28% aqueous ammonium hydroxide (80 ml) solution for 3 h. The layers were separated and the organic phase was stirred with ethylenediaminetetraacetate (300 mg) for 3 h. Then demineralised water (100 ml) was added, and the mixture was stirred for another hour. The layers were separated and the organic layer was washed with demineralised water and reduced in volume in vacuum and precipitated in methanol. The precipitate was collected in a Soxhlet thimble and was extracted with methanol, hexane and chloroform until the extracts were colourless. The chloroform fraction was reduced in volume and precipitated in methanol and filtered over a 4.5 µm PTFE filter. The polymer was collected and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight, resulting in 70 mg (69%) of a dark blue powder. 1H NMR: 8.6 (br, 2H), 7.4 (br, 4H), 7.1 (br, 2H), 4.0 (br, 4H), 1.9 (br, 2H), 1.20–1.00 (br, 48H), 0.8–0.7 (br, 12H).

Results and discussion
Synthesis
In the remainder of the PDPP-XYX notation will be abbreviated as XYX, with X = F or T and Y = F, T, or P (Scheme 1). The synthesis of the new XYX polymers was accomplished via a Suzuki polymerization as outlined in Scheme 2. This procedure required access to 3,6-bis(5-bromofuran-2-yl)-2,5-dihydro-2,5-bis(2-hexyldecyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrolo-1,4-dione (1) and 3,6-bis(5-bromothien-2-yl)-2,5-dihydro-2,5-bis(2-hexyldecyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrolo-1,4-dione (2) as well as 2,2′-(2,5-furandiyl)bis[4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane] (3), 2,2′-(2,5-thiophenediyl)bis[4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane] (4), and 2,2′-(1,4-phenylene)bis[4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane] (5).
 Scheme 2  Synthesis of the polymers described in this study: (i) Pd2(dba)3, K3PO4, PPh3, Aliquat 336, water, toluene, yield 44–69%. 
The synthesis of monomer 1 is depicted in Scheme 3. In the first step 2-furonitrile and diethyl succinate were condensed to form 6 in a one pot reaction. DPP derivative 6 was then alkylated using potassium carbonate as the base yielding the better soluble DPP derivative 7. Subsequent bromination yielded the desired monomer 1. The other monomers were synthesized as described before (2)13 or were commercially available (3–5).
 Scheme 3  Synthesis of 1. 
The polymers were obtained via Suzuki polymerization in yields varying from 44% to 69% after purification by Soxhlet extraction. Only the chloroform fraction was used and the hexane fraction and insoluble material were discarded. The reaction conditions for the polymerizations have been optimized to provide the highest possible molecular weight. All polymers are very soluble in chloroform (>5 mg ml−1) at room temperature. Molecular weights were estimated at 80 °C in o-DCB. The number average molecular weight (Mn) ranges from 13000 to 17000 g mol−1 (Table 1). Although all polymers were subjected to Soxhlet fractionation, the polydispersity index (PDI) varies over a broad range, being the highest (>5) for FPF. The similar Mn and PDI for TFT, FTF and FFF allow a direct comparison of these three polymers for optoelectronic applications.

Optical and electrochemical properties
The absorption spectra of the polymers are shown in Fig. 1 and the optical band gaps determined from the onsets of absorption are collected in Table 1 and compared to the TPT and TTT polymers reported in ref. 11 and 12. The shape of the absorption spectra in solution and in solid state is remarkably similar, indicating that the polymers are not fully molecularly dissolved. This is confirmed by the fact that for all polymers the maximum at higher wavelengths of the absorption spectrum in solution is decreasing in intensity upon heating. In the ESI† we show the temperature dependent absorption spectra of the polymers in CHCl3, which is the best solvent known to us for these materials. In CHCl3 at 60 °C the onset of optical absorption of polymers shows a small blue shift. The resulting values for the optical band gap are collected and compared in Table 1.
 Fig. 1  Normalized optical absorption spectra of the different polymers in o-DCB solution (a) and in solid state (b). The curves are offset vertically for clarity. 
The optical band gap is significantly larger for FPF and TPT than that for the other materials. Steric hindrance will cause the phenylene ring to partly twist out of the plane defined by the furan or thiophene rings, which reduces the orbital overlap and conjugation in the electron rich part of the polymer chain. For the furan/thiophene trimers there is a distinct steady increase of the optical band gap with increasing number of furan units by about 0.1 eV going from TTT to FFF.
The energy levels of the polymers have been determined with cyclic voltammetry, in o-DCB solution, using TBAPF6 as the electrolyte. For the new furan-based polymers, the band gap derived from electrochemical measurements is generally in good agreement with the optical band gap (Table 1). We tentatively assign the band gaps in both experiments to that of aggregated species. In contrast, the electrochemical and optical band gaps of TPT and TTT differ substantially, obstructing a quantitative comparison between these polymers and their furan containing analogs. The ambiguity of the cyclic voltammetry data could possibly originate from the difference in size of polymer aggregates in the o-DCB solution, causing the charging of the polymer particles to be different. The oxidation and reduction potentials can be translated to HOMO and LUMO energy levels which are schematically depicted in Fig. 2. Compared to the other polymers, FPF and TPT that have a phenylene ring in the main chain are somewhat more difficult to oxidize and therefore the open circuit voltage in a cell with PCBM is expected to be higher than that for the other polymers (FFF, FTF, TFT, and TTT) for which the HOMO levels are rather similar.

Field-effect transistors
Charge carrier mobilities of the polymers were measured in a bottom gate, bottom contact FET. From the transfer curves (Fig. 3) it is evident that the polymers show ambipolar behaviour (further FET data are shown in the ESI†). The electron and hole mobilities (µe and µh) determined from the slope of the square root of the source–drain current (IDS)14 in the saturation regime are listed in Table 2. Mobilities are in the range of 10−3 to 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 for both polarities, except for FFF where µe is significantly smaller (Fig. 3). As a general trend, replacing thiophene by furan results in a reduced mobility. In comparison, we note that although it is known that Mn can affect the mobility of charge carriers,15 this was previously not observed for PDPP-TTT.11 Since differences in Mn among the new polymers are small, we think that these are not the primary cause for the observed differences in the mobility. The charge carrier mobilities are generally higher than those found for DPP polymers with more extended aromatic structures in the chain.16

Photovoltaic devices
Solar cells consisting of XYX:[70]PCBM thin films on a pre-cleaned, patterned ITO substrate covered with a thin layer of PEDOT:PSS were made via spin coating. The devices were completed by thermal evaporation of the back contact made of 1 nm of LiF and 100 nm of aluminium. The composition of the active layers was optimized and it was found that the best performance was reached at an XYX:[70]PCBM weight ratio of 1:2, except for FFF where a 1:1 ratio gave higher power conversion. When the active layers were spin coated from pure chloroform, the devices showed moderate PCEs in the range of 0.5–1.3% (see Fig. 4). However, addition of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as co-solvent to the solution gave rise to a significantly (factor of 2–4) enhanced performance (Fig. 4).17 For all polymers, a good performance can be obtained for a relatively wide range of concentrations of DIO, but a relatively large amount had to be added to reach the highest PCE (100 mg ml−1 for FPF and TFT, and 200 mg ml−1 for FTF and FFF).

Fig. 5 shows the tapping mode AFM surface topology for the active layers processed from pure chloroform and after addition of the optimal amount of DIO. For pure chloroform the layers show relatively large (150–300 nm) globular clusters that can be attributed to [70]PCBM domains.18 The large [70]PCBM clusters originate from the fact that during the drying of the film [70]PCBM crystallizes before the polymer is solidifying. This results in a very coarse phase separation and high RMS roughness (11.6–13.4 nm). In layers where the co-solvent is used, a much finer intermixing of [70]PCBM and polymer domains is found and the RMS roughness of the layers is less (Table 3). For layers with TFT and FFF the final RMS roughness is still somewhat higher than for layers with FPF and FTF, but this is not reflected in the photovoltaic performance (Table 3).

 Fig. 5  AMF topography images (lateral size: 5 µm) of the topside of layers made of [70]PCBM and FPF (a and b), FFF (c and d), FTF (e and f) and TFT (g and h) in the optimal ratio without DIO (a, c, e, and g) and with the optimal amount of DIO (b, d, f, and h). Height scales are 50 nm (a, c, e, and g), 10 nm (b and f) and 60 nm (d and h). 
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best cells are shown in Fig. 6, together with the monochromatic external quantum efficiency. The short circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and PCE that characterize the cells are collected in Table 3. For the furan containing polymers the PCE = 1.9–3.8% is less than for TPT (5.5%) and TTT (4.7%) described in ref. 11 and 12. The Voc of the cells of the phenylene polymers (FPF and TPT) is higher than for those only based on thiophene or furan, consistent with their somewhat higher oxidation potentials. The fill factors (FF) of all the cells are relatively high (>0.6, except for FFF), indicative of high and balanced charge carrier mobility. It is tempting to relate the reduced fill factor of the FFF cell to its lower intrinsic hole mobility (Table 2), but we note that FTF, which has similar mobility, gives rise to a higher FF. The differences can possibly originate from a less optimal morphology for FFF.

The molecular weight of the polymer has proven to be a crucial parameter in film formation and photovoltaic performance in a solar cell made with TTT.11 Films of similar molecular weight FTF or FFF-based polymer display a similar surface profile and roughness as films made with lower molecular weight (Mn = 10000 g mol−1) TTT.11 For the low Mn version of TTT, the maximum PCE of 2.7% is similar to the FFF, FTF, and TFT polymers that have comparable Mn (Table 3). This strongly suggests that for the furan based polymers the performance of the solar cells can be further increased when higher molecular weight materials can be obtained in the polymerization. In accordance, Fréchet et al. have very recently reported on similar furan-containing small band-gap polymers, PDPP-TFT and PDPP-FFF, polymerized via a Stille reaction that led to higher molecular weights and correspondingly higher efficiencies in solar cells.19 This demonstrates that furan-based polymers are indeed a suitable alternative to their thiophene-based analogs.
Conclusions
Four new DPP-based small optical band gap co-polymers with different numbers of furan rings in the repeating unit have been synthesized and optimized with respect to their molecular weight. The polymers have an optical gap between 1.4 and 1.6 eV and exhibit ambipolar charge transport in field-effect transistors with hole and electron mobilities up to 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1. In combination with [70]PCBM the polymers give power conversion efficiencies up to 3.7% in bulk heterojunction solar cells. Although this clearly shows that furan based conjugated polymers do provide good performance in solar cells, their efficiency is somewhat less than that for the corresponding thiophene based materials. The reduction can be ascribed to the lower molecular weights that have been obtained in the polymerization reactions. Higher molecular weight materials often give better performance in bulk heterojunction solar cells due to improved film forming properties and morphology.11,19,20
