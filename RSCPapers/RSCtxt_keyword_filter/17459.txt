    , Accepted 19th July 2022First published on 21st July 2022Abstract2-TA and 3-TA were introduced for the first time on the surface of ZnO, and used as SAMs for interfacial modification. A highest PCE of 20.6% was achieved for 2-TA PSCs with improved energy alignment and perovskite film quality, and reduced defect density. The modified ZnO exhibited better thermostability of the perovskite and resultant device stability.
As emerging photovoltaic materials, the lead halide perovskites have aroused considerable attention due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties.1 In recent years, with the synergistic developments of processing engineering, chemical composition, interfacial engineering, and device architectures, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) utilizing perovskite materials as light absorbers has raised from 3.8% to a certified 25.7%.2,3
In planar PSCs, the electron transport layer (ETL) plays a crucial role in extracting and transporting electrons, and thus helps to block holes.4 To date, various metal oxides have been designed and established as candidates for the ETL of regular PSCs.4 ZnO has been considered as a promising choice owing to its high transparency, high electron mobility, favorable energy level and structural variability. Also, ZnO is easily solution processed at a low temperature of 200 °C and thus is potentially applicable to flexible PSC devices.4,5 However, the poor chemical compatibility has limited the application of ZnO in PSCs, since the hydroxyl groups on the ZnO surface and its Lewis basicity can accelerate the degradation of the perovskite absorber.6 In addition, the oxygen vacancies on the ZnO surface also inevitably bring about an effect on the device efficiency and stability. To date, ZnO-based PSCs with PCEs exceeding 20% have been less achieved,7–10 which is significantly lagging behind PSCs based on TiO2 or SnO2.
To date, many strategies have been attempted to address the above-mentioned issues. In addition to the doping of ZnO and adjusting the composition of the perovskite,9,10 introducing organic or inorganic materials to modify the ZnO/perovskite interface has proven to be an effective strategy,7,8,11 which can passivate defects, adjust the charge behavior, control the crystal quality of the perovskite and thus improve the performance of PSCs. For instance, Cao et al. modified the ZnO with a thin layer of MgO-EA+ under 450 °C, and the resulting PSCs demonstrated a high PCE of 21.1% with improved stability.7 Compared to inorganic materials, organic modifiers have the advantages of molecular structure diversity and low-temperature processability, and interfacial modification of metal oxides by self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of organic molecules has been considered as a facile and efficient strategy.11–16 At present, several SAM molecules have been investigated as the surface modifiers of ZnO ETLs. Chen et al. employed 3-aminopropanoic acid for the first time as a self-assembled molecule to modify ZnO, and the highly crystalline MAPbI3 films and better aligned energy levels contributed to an increased Voc and the best PCE of 15.67%.11 Later, SAMs such as T2CA and JTCA,12etc., were developed to enhance the Voc, PCE and stability of PSCs. Although some progress has been achieved, the PCEs of SAM-modified ZnO PSCs are still below 20% currently. Therefore, SAM modification on the ZnO/perovskite interface for highly efficient and stable PSCs has remained an appealing challenge.
Herein, we introduce the molecules 2-thiophene acetic acid (2-TA) and 3-thiophene acetic acid (3-TA) to form SAMs on the surface of ZnO for interfacial modification. The TA modifiers can simultaneously passivate the defects on the surface of ZnO and the perovskite, and the deposition of TA onto ZnO can facilitate the growth of a high-quality perovskite. Thus, the charge recombination induced by trap states at the interface and within the perovskite film is reduced. Besides, the interfacial energy level alignment is also improved owing to the formation of a dipole moment, which can contribute to the charge transport and collection. As a result, a markedly increased PCE from 18.1% to 20.6% and 20.0% was achieved for the 2-TA and 3-TA modified PSCs, and 20.6% is one of the highest reported PCEs for ZnO-based PSCs. More importantly, the TA-modified ZnO exhibited better thermostability of the perovskite and resultant PSC device stability.
The molecular structures and electrostatic potential (ESP) plots of 2-TA and 3-TA are displayed in Fig. 1. A similar color gradient for the two molecules can be observed from the ESP, indicating the increased electron density from the thiophene rings to the carboxyl acid groups.14 Besides, we calculated the dipole moments of the 2-TA and 3-TA molecules by DFT, and the resulting strength is 4.09 and 4.02 Debye, respectively. These dipole moments associated with electron donation from the thiophene rings to the ZnO are expected to change the surface electronic states of ZnO, implying that both of the molecules are competent SAM modifiers for ZnO. Normally, TA molecules with a carboxyl group can bond with ZnO by condensation reaction,5 while thiophene itself can act as a Lewis base by donating a lone pair of electrons of sulfur (Fig. 1b), and improve the property of perovskites by passivating Pb2+ defects on the surface. All these effects ultimately contribute to the enhanced device efficiency and alleviated deprotonation reaction between ZnO and perovskite.5,7Fig. 1c shows a schematic diagram of the device structure, where the photoactive layer is Cs0.17FA0.83PbI2.7Br0.3 (Cs-FA), and the TA-based SAMs are inserted between Cs-FA and ZnO.

To elucidate the bonding states between TA-based molecules and ZnO, XPS measurement was performed, as shown in Fig. 2a and b. After modification with 2-TA and 3-TA, the binding energy of the characteristic peaks of Zn 2p1/2 and Zn 2p3/2 located at 1044.37 eV and 1021.33 eV decreased to 1044.25 eV and 1021.21 eV, respectively, which confirmed that these molecules were successfully anchored to the ZnO surface and changed the electronic states. Besides, the O 1s state of the modified ZnO ETLs also shifted from 530.31 eV to 530.25 eV, further demonstrating the interaction between ZnO and the TA-based SAM molecules. As displayed in Fig. S1d–f (ESI†), the broad O 1s spectra can be deconvoluted into two peaks for all samples. The peaks at low and high binding energy originate from the lattice oxygen (OL) and vacancy oxygen (OV) of ZnO, respectively.15 According to the area of the divided peaks, the ratio of OV (ROV) can be calculated as SOV/(SOV + SOL). The decreased ROV from 0.466 in the pristine ZnO to 0.448 and 0.444 in 2-TA and 3-TA modified ZnO indicates that the OV was effectively passivated by the SAMs, and 3-TA seems to show a slightly better passivation effect of surface defects compared to 2-TA. In addition, the observed characteristic peak assigned to S 2p at around 164 eV (Fig. S2, ESI†) further demonstrated the presence of these SAM modifiers on the target film.

Subsequently, the effect of interfacial modification on the alignment of the energy levels was investigated. Fig. S3a and b (ESI†) show the onset (Eonset) and cutoff (Ecutoff) curves of the perovskite film obtained from UPS characterization. Thus, one can estimate that the valence band maximum (VBM) of the perovskite is 5.72 eV. According to the optical band gap (Eg) derived from the Tauc plot (Fig. S3c, ESI†), the conduction band (CBM) of the perovskite was calculated to be 4.13 eV. In addition, the energy level positions of the ZnO films were analyzed using UPS (Fig. 2c and d). All calculated parameters, including the work function (WF), VBM and CBM, for the ZnO, ZnO/2-TA, ZnO/3-TA and perovskite films are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). The WF of ZnO after modification is significantly closer to the CBM of Cs-FA, which can reduce the Voc loss of the PSCs (Fig. 2e). This result confirms the interfacial dipole effects induced by the SAM molecules.11 Furthermore, ZnO/2-TA has a slightly lower WF than ZnO/3-TA, which is more beneficial to promote electron extraction and transport and thus improve the Jsc and FF of PSCs.
To investigate the effect of the SAMs on the surface wettability of the ZnO films, we measured the water contact angle (Fig. S4a–c, ESI†). After modification with 2-TA and 3-TA, the surface contact angle of the pristine ZnO increased significantly from 33.9° to 52.8° and 51.4°, respectively, which indicates the enhanced hydrophobic property of ZnO. This also caused the slightly reduced wettability of the perovskite precursor on the ZnO surface. It is understood that the larger contact angle was beneficial to grow perovskite films with a larger grain size and fewer defect states.12,17 Therefore, the morphology of perovskite films grown on the ZnO was further investigated by SEM. As shown in Fig. S4d–f (ESI†), the perovskite grain size significantly increased after modification with 2-TA and 3-TA, which is attributed to the reduced wettability of the ZnO surface.17 The larger grain size and improved morphology are of vital importance to facilitate charge transfer and reduce the charge recombination derived from defect states.
Fig. S5a (ESI†) presents the X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the perovskite films deposited on different ETLs. The enhanced intensities of the diffraction peaks assigned to the (110), (112), (310) and (224) planes were attributed to the improved crystallization of the perovskite after modification with 2-TA and 3-TA. Notably, the absence of the PbI2 diffraction peak for all samples indicates that the perovskite film is thermally stable under these conditions. Besides, the Cs-FA perovskite on TA-modified ZnO showed a small increase in absorbance (Fig. S5b, ESI†), which is consistent with the results of SEM and XRD. As shown in the XPS spectra of Fig. S6 (ESI†), the peaks of Pb 4f shift to a lower binding energy for the TA-doped Cs-FA films, confirming the interaction between the thiophene of the TA molecules and Pb2+ in the perovskite.14 To further explore the effect of the TA-based SAMs on defect passivation, we compared the onset voltage of the trap-filled limit (VTFL) region of the electron-only devices (Fig. 3a). The decreased VTFL from 0.82 V to 0.62 V and 0.56 V for the 2-TA and 3-TA modified devices confirmed that the SAM modifiers could promote the reduction of the interfacial trap-state density,17 especially for the 3-TA modifier. Fig. 3b shows the decay dynamics of the TRPL spectra for the perovskite films. The longer lifetime of perovskite deposited on the modified ZnO (in which 3-TA is slightly longer than 2-TA) indicated that this SAM modification could reduce recombination caused by trap states in the perovskite.17

We then investigated the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs. Fig. 3c plots the best-performing current density–voltage (J–V) curves, and the related photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. The optimal PCE increases from 18.1% for the pristine PSCs to 20.6% and 20.0% after 2-TA and 3-TA modification. Among them, the 2-TA modified device showed the more obvious device performance improvement with a relatively higher Jsc of 22.9 mA cm2 and FF of 77.5% than 3-TA, benefiting from the more aligned energy level and the improved perovskite film quality. Meanwhile, the 3-TA modified device showed a mildly larger increase of Voc to 1.17 V, which is simultaneously attributed to the reduced trap-assisted recombination and lowered WF of the ETL. The statistical photovoltaic parameters for the three types of device are shown in Fig S7 (ESI†). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. 3d) of the PSCs demonstrated an integrated Jsc value of 20.0, 21.1 and 20.5 mA cm−2, respectively, which is in good agreement with that obtained from the J–V curve. The steady-state output of the devices at maximal power point exhibited a constant PCE of about 17.1%, 19.8% and 19.3% (Fig. S8, ESI†), respectively. Fig. S9 (ESI†) provides a histogram of the PCE distribution for 40 devices, and most of the efficiencies based on TA modification are greater than 18.5%, demonstrating the good reproducibility of the device performance. Besides, the devices with 2-TA and 3-TA showed a significantly reduced hysteresis effect ascribed to the reduced trap states and improved energy level induced by the SAMs, as shown in Fig. S10 and Table S2 (ESI†). For reliability, we also studied the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs at a larger active area with a result that the PSC based on 2-TA delivered an optimum PCE of 20.2% (Fig. S11 and Table S3, ESI†).

Then, the correlations between SAM modification and the resultant PSC performance were further studied. Fig. S12a and b (ESI†) display the dependence of Jsc and Voc on light intensity for PSCs. The smaller slope (n = 1.45, 1.43) of the 2-TA and 3-TA modified PSCs suggests suppressed Shockley–Read–Hall recombination owing to the reduced trap states in the ZnO/perovskite, which is consistent with the result of VTFL analysis. The 2-TA and 3-TA modified PSCs exhibited an increased α value (0.985 and 0.980) closer to unity compared to the pristine PSC device (0.966), indicating a decrease in bimolecular recombination owing to the favorable band alignment and efficient coupling interface.17 As shown in Fig. 4a, the photocurrent decay time was obviously reduced for the devices with modification, especially when the modifier is 2-TA, confirming the faster charge extraction and more efficient charge transport. The slightly larger α value and faster photocurrent decay jointly account for the higher Jsc and FF of the PSCs based on 2-TA. Furthermore, we conducted impedance spectroscopy measurement of the PSCs (Fig. S13, ESI†). The fitted values of charge transfer resistance (Rct) derived from high frequency were reduced from 59.1 kΩ to 40.0 kΩ and 44.6 kΩ for the 2-TA and 3-TA modified device, respectively (Table S4, ESI†), confirming the improved charge transfer. Meanwhile, the modified devices showed higher carrier recombination resistance (Rrec) than the control device, confirming the prominently suppressed interfacial recombination, especially the 3-TA modified device, which largely contributed to the high Voc of the PSCs.

Finally, the thermal stability of the perovskite was investigated using the XRD patterns (Fig. S14, ESI†). As the thermal treatment temperature was elevated from 100 °C to 110 °C, there is a markedly enhanced intensity of the PbI2 diffraction peak for the perovskite film deposited on pristine ZnO, indicating the more severe decomposition. In addition, the PSC devices with these annealed perovskite layers were further fabricated (Fig. S15, ESI†). It can be observed that the TA-modified PSCs have tiny PCE attenuation, while the pristine PSC degraded to a PCE of 15.0% from 18.1% (Table S5, ESI†), which is consistent with the XRD result. These results fully confirm that this TA modification can efficiently enhance the thermal stability of the perovskite on ZnO. We have also explored the durability of the unencapsulated PSCs during storage under ambient conditions. After 480 hours of aging, both the PSC device modified with 2-TA and 3-TA still maintained more than 80% of the initial PCE, while the PCE of the control device dropped to around 60%. The result of PCE decay was further verified by the PbI2 signal obtained from the XRD patterns of the perovskite films (Fig. S16, ESI†). Clearly, the PSCs with SAM modification exhibited improved long-term stability, which might originate from the reduced interfacial defect states, improved perovskite film quality, and weakened proton transfer reaction at the interface.
In summary, we developed a facile but effective method to fabricate efficient and stable ZnO PSCs by introducing TA-based SAMs to modify the interface. The TA modifiers can not only bond with ZnO and passivate its surface trap sites, but passivate the Pb2+ defects of the perovskite. Besides, the dipole moments induced by the interface linkers lowered the WF of ZnO, resulting in the favorable band alignment. This SAM modification also facilitated the perovskite film growth with high-quality. These synergistic effects can reduce the trap-assisted charge recombination and facilitate the interfacial charge transport and collection. As a result, the optimized PSC based on the ZnO/2-TA achieved a highest PCE of 20.6% with slightly higher Jsc and FF than 3-TA. Importantly, the perovskite deposited on TA-modified ZnO exhibited better thermal stability and better durability of the resultant PSC devices.
