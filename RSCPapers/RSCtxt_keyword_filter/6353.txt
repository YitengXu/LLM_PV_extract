    , Accepted 30th December 2016First published on 30th December 2016AbstractPhotocatalysis and photovoltaics are two major approaches sharing similar processes (including light absorption, and charge generation and separation) for solar energy conversion with semiconductors. Various strategies have been proposed to improve the efficiency of solar energy conversion due to limited light absorption and rapid charge recombination in semiconductors. Integrating semiconductors with plasmonic nanostructures has been proven as an effective way to greatly enhance the performance in photocatalysis and photovoltaic devices.

Furthermore, we review some recent progress in practical applications such as photocatalytic water splitting, artificial photosynthesis, photodegradation of organic pollutants and solar cells integrated with plasmonic nanostructures. In specific cases, the possible working mechanisms for the enhancement of photocatalytic or photovoltaic performance by plasmonics are clarified together with materials design. Finally, the existing challenges and future prospects for the utilization of plasmonics in solar energy conversion are discussed.

1. Introduction
The current energy crisis spurs us on to find a new pollution-free, sustainable energy source. Solar energy is the most promising one to meet the future demand as the energy from the Sun is in limitless supply. Photocatalysis and photovoltaics are the main processes for the conversion of solar energy, which transform and/or store photon energy to chemical bonds and electricity, respectively.1,2 For example, photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and carbon dioxide reduction into organic molecules such as methane, methanol or formic acid can readily achieve the transformation and storage of solar energy.3,4 This transformation not only produces fuel molecules, but also provides an alternative carbon-neutral process for the world.
Although the photocatalytic and photovoltaic approaches show great potential in solar energy conversion, the conversion efficiencies from solar energy to chemical energy or electricity in many systems have yet to be improved upon for practical applications. Looking into the working mechanisms, one can recognize that two common bottlenecks often exist in both solar utilization schemes – the limited light absorption and the rapid charge recombination in semiconductors.5 Some semiconductors that have been explored for photocatalytic and photovoltaic applications possess relatively low light absorption coefficients. In particular, semiconductors with wide bandgaps such as TiO2 (Eg = 3.2 eV) can only absorb light in the ultraviolet region so as to waste the visible and near-infrared photons that account for a large portion of the full solar spectrum.6 Moreover, the semiconductors often have large refractive indices, which would further exacerbate light reflection. On the other hand, the photoexcited electrons and holes tend to recombine before they can reach the catalyst surface for chemical reactions or electrodes for electricity collection.7 When the apparent physical sizes of semiconductors are larger than the carrier transmission distance, the photoexcited electrons and holes tend to recombine in the bulk phase rather than transport to the surface. Thus the two bottlenecks largely limit the utilization and conversion efficiencies of solar photons. For this reason, it is imperative to develop solutions to broaden light absorption and suppress charge recombination toward efficient solar energy conversion.
The integration of semiconductors with plasmonic metal nanostructures has been proven to be an effective solution to overcome the limitations as the plasmonic nanostructures can act as subwavelength antennae to concentrate light and the resulting enhanced local electromagnetic field can promote the separation of electrons from holes.8,9 In addition, the plasmonic nanostructures absorb the light via the collective oscillations of surface electrons, so the free electrons can be excited and directly injected into the conduction band of semiconductors for chemical reactions or electricity generation.10 Taken together, these merits designate the implementation of plasmonic nanostructures into photocatalysis and photovoltaics as a promising strategy for solar energy conversion. In this review article, we will outline the recent progress in plasmonics-enhanced photocatalytic (including photocatalytic water splitting, artificial photosynthesis and photodegradation of organic pollutant) and photovoltaic systems, together with the fundamental mechanisms behind each application. From the working mechanisms, the readers would recognize that many applications share similar fundamentals, and are able to design plasmonic nanostructures and their interfacial structures with semiconductors for specific applications. We aim to provide a different overview on the entire plasmonic solar energy conversion field from the existing reviews that have been mainly focused on the fundamental physics of interfacial structures or a single application.11–17
2. Surface plasmon of metal nanostructures
Plasmonic metal nanostructures offer high capabilities for light trapping and electromagnetic field enhancement as the free electrons on the metal surface can have strong interactions with incident photons. When the frequency of the incident photons matches well with the inherent frequency of the free electrons on the surface of metal nanostructures, it will lead to a collective oscillation commonly known as localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) as shown in Fig. 1.18,19 The collective oscillation of electrons results in an enhanced local electromagnetic field, which is mainly confined to the metal surface. Upon this resonant excitation, the plasmon relaxes within tens of femtoseconds. The relaxation partially takes place through radiative photon emission (i.e., scattering). Meanwhile, it generates energetic charge-carriers at the nanoparticle surface through non-radiative Landau damping (i.e., absorption). The energetic electron–hole pairs are commonly called hot electrons/holes, whose energy matches the resonant photon energy. The hot electrons can interact with other charge carriers and nanoparticle lattices, inducing the cooling of hot electrons. The cooling will transfer the energy of hot electrons to the phonon modes of nanoparticles, observed as a photothermal process. The photothermal conversion increases the temperature of the metal surface dozens of degrees Celsius.

Enabled by the working mechanisms, surface plasmon provides a powerful tool to concentrate light at the metal–dielectric interface. Here the dielectric layer includes all the possible types of matters that surround metal nanostructures such as air, water, organic species or inorganic coating. As an antenna, the surface plasmon shows great application prospects in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS),20 sensing,21 photocatalysis22 and photovoltaics.23 Among various plasmonic metal nanostructures, Au and Ag nanocrystals are most widely used as antennae to concentrate light in photocatalysis and photovoltaics.24,25
2.1 Manipulation of LSPR in metal nanostructures
There are two basic parameters for LSPR-mediated applications: the coefficient and wavelength of maximum extinction where the extinction is the sum of scattering and absorption. The extinction coefficient reflects the ability to concentrate light at the metal–dielectric interface. Relative to the coefficient, the wavelength of maximum extinction may play a more important role in solar light utilization as it determines the band of light harvesting. The excitation of wide-bandgap semiconductors requires the high photon energy mainly located in the ultraviolet region, which fails to utilize the visible and infrared light that occupies 95% of photons in the full solar spectrum. Thus harvesting visible and infrared light is a central task for solar energy conversion, towards which surface plasmons can make major contributions. In certain plasmon-mediated applications (e.g., local electromagnetic field enhancement), it also requires a substantial spectral overlap between semiconductors and plasmonic nanostructures, highlighting the importance of tuning plasmonic bands. For this reason, it is highly important to tune the plasmonic features toward solar energy conversion applications.
Previous reports indicate that the LSPR features have strong correlations with the compositions and morphologies of metal nanostructures as well as the dielectric layers on the metal surface. The correlations provide a great opportunity for tuning the coefficient and wavelength of maximum extinction. For instance, the wavelengths of maximum extinction for silver, gold and copper nanospheres are located in the near-ultraviolet and visible regions (420 nm for 38 ± 12 nm Ag nanospheres, 520 nm for 25 ± 5 nm Au nanospheres, and 610 nm for 133 ± 23 nm Cu nanospheres), respectively (Fig. 2a).

(a) Normalized extinction spectra for different metal elements including Ag (38 ± 12 nm diameter), Au (25 ± 5 nm) and Cu (133 ± 23 nm) nanospheres, respectively.

As the surface plasmon may propagate along the surface with different directions, the morphologies of metal nanostructures determine the number of extinction peaks (Fig. 2b). In the case of one-dimensional structures, the surface plasmon propagation takes place along the longitudinal direction. For example, Au nanorods exhibit two resonance peaks which are attributed to longitudinal and transverse plasmon resonance bands, respectively. The longitudinal LSPR peak is sensitive to the aspect ratios (ARs) of Au nanorods which can be regulated via selective chemical etching.26 The wavelength of maximum extinction can also be tuned via the anisotropic growth of another element with the assistance of selective surfactant adsorption on the specific surface or via underpotential deposition (UPD) mechanism.27 Longitudinal LSPR maxima can be red-shifted from 700 nm to 1200 nm by increasing aspect ratios (Fig. 2c), while the transverse LSPR peak remains unchanged.28
In addition to the intrinsic parameters, extinction spectra are also associated with the dielectric layer around metal nanostructures. In a typical case, Au nanodisks with increasing sizes show totally different wavelengths and coefficients of maximum extinction when they are immersed in water (n = 1.33) and biomedium (n = 1.41), respectively (Fig. 2d).29 The wavelength of maximum extinction is red-shifted with the increase in their extinction intensities as the dielectric constant (n) is increased. This highlights that we should pay attention to the actual environment of plasmonic nanoparticles in real plasmon-related applications.
2.2 Spatial distribution of electromagnetic field
As we mentioned above, the free electrons on the metal nanostructure surface will achieve a collective oscillation under incident light with an appropriate frequency. This oscillation is accompanied by the enhanced local electromagnetic field in space as shown in Fig. 3a. Theoretical simulation is a powerful tool to reveal the plasmonic behaviour of metal nanostructures under incident light. In recent years, a number of theories have been developed, and in turn, plentiful cases have been analyzed.30,31 In particular, the Mie theory is thought to be the most efficient theory to predict the plasmonic behavior under incident light with diverse frequencies.32 The discrete dipole approximation (DDA) and finite difference time-domain (FDTD) calculations based on the Mie theory are powerful tools to investigate the spatial distribution of the electromagnetic field for complicated nanostructures.33

It has been proven that the spatial distribution of the electromagnetic field is strongly dependent on the geometrical shape of metal nanostructures.34–36 The electromagnetic near-field enhancement for an isolated nanosphere is unevenly distributed, and it becomes more complicated when the nanostructure has an irregular shape. It is commonly considered that the field enhancement is concentrated on sharp corners and edges known as “hot spots”. Taking Au concave nanocubes as an example, the electromagnetic field at sharp corners is obviously stronger than that on faces (Fig. 3b and c).37 Specifically, the enhanced electromagnetic field intensity at the corners can be 1000 times higher than the incident light. Similarly, Au nanorods offer the localization of electromagnetic field enhancement at their endpoints. This indicates that the metal nanostructures with more complicated corners may possess a stronger capability of light concentration.
When two nanoparticles with different morphologies or compositions get closer to form a symmetry-breaking dimer, their local electromagnetic fields will be coupled to induce a strong Fano resonance. Tian et al. investigated electromagnetic field coupling by assembling Au nanospheres and Ag nanocubes with an appropriate gap distance. As the Au nanosphere and the Ag nanocube form a dimer with a gap distance, a broad scattering peak can be generated when polarization is perpendicular to the dimer axis in the simulated scattering spectra (Fig. 3d). The broad peak can be split into two peaks, which are assigned to the dipole–dipole coupling mode, when polarization is parallel to the dimer axis. The strong coupling is reflected by the substantially higher field enhancement at the hot spots of 1 and 2.38 For a more complicated Au nanocluster assembly, abundant Au–Au interfaces are formed to couple the localized surface plasmon. As a result, charge plots show more complicated field distribution, concentrated at the cluster interfaces (Fig. 3e).39
In a different system, light can be concentrated and confined to the metal–oxide interface when a metal nanoparticle is in contact with the oxide. For a Au–TiO2 Janus particle, the Au nanosphere is partly surrounded by the TiO2 layer with a high refractive index and the solvent with a low refractive index. As such, a local electromagnetic field is mainly confined to the Au–TiO2 interface as shown in Fig. 3f. Based on this important feature, the light concentrated at the interface couples with the semiconductor to more easily transfer solar energy to TiO2 in practical applications owing to the reduced operation distance and the enhanced local electromagnetic field.40
In brief, light concentration and confinement can be achieved at the surface of plasmonic nanostructures via plasmonic effects. The plasmonic properties can be tuned by controlling the morphologies, constituents and physical arrangements of plasmonic metal nanostructures, harvesting visible and near-infrared light. The tunable optical properties can in turn meet the demand for harvesting solar energy in a specific spectral range toward applications in photocatalysis and photovoltaics.
3. Plasmonic nanostructures for photocatalysis
Photocatalysis is a process converting solar energy to chemical energy that can be stored in chemical bonds by virtue of semiconductors. In a typical photocatalytic process, semiconductors absorb light with appropriate energy to excite their electrons from the valence band to the conduction band, which generates photoexcited electrons and holes. The photo-generated electron–hole pairs are separated and transferred to the surface for redox reactions such as hydrogen and oxygen evolution during water splitting. The integration of semiconductors with plasmonic nanostructures can make multiple contributions to the improvement of photocatalytic performance. For instance, metal nanostructures with a plasmonic band in the visible region can offer complementary light absorption to wide-bandgap semiconductors such as TiO2, which are generally more active in photocatalysis; plasmonic nanostructures can enhance charge separation in semiconductors using different methods.
3.1 Mechanisms
When plasmonic metal nanostructures are integrated with semiconductors, the charge kinetics in photocatalysis can be maneuvered. In such a metal–semiconductor hybrid system, a Schottky barrier is formed at the metal–semiconductor interface. The Schottky junction traps photoexcited electrons on the metal, which designates the metal as a cocatalyst for surface reduction reactions.41 More importantly, plasmonic nanostructures can act as antennae to concentrate light to vastly promote light utilization efficiency. In principle, plasmonic nanostructures facilitate the photocatalytic process by means of the following three mechanisms: hot electron injection, local electromagnetic field enhancement and resonant energy transfer.

Hot electron injection. 
Plasmon decay takes place through radiative photon re-emission and non-radiative Landau damping. The non-radiative decay generates energetic electrons and holes, which are commonly referred to as hot electrons and hot holes, respectively (Fig. 4a). When energetic incident photons are absorbed by the free electrons of the metal nanostructure, the electrons will leap over the Fermi level to a higher energy level (Ef + hν) (Fig. 4b). The majority of energetic electrons are dissipated by electron–electron scattering in about 100 femtoseconds (fs). In the meantime, a small number of energetic electrons will be transferred to adjacent species such as organic molecules and semiconductors (Fig. 4c).42

Driven by the Schottky junction, the electrons in the conduction band of semiconductors have a tendency to flow to the metal surface. In this case, considerable attention should be paid to the Fermi level equilibrium after the accumulation of carriers on the metal nanostructures (Fig. 4d). Since electron accumulation can shift the Fermi level of metallic nanostructures to a more negative potential, the resulting apparent Fermi level of the hybrid structure would eventually reach an equilibrium, which is closer to the conduction band of semiconductors. The shifting of the Fermi level thus improves the energetics of the semiconductor system, which can be regulated by controlling the size of metal nanoparticles.43 The Fermi level equilibration effect facilitates the extraction of carriers and suppression of charge recombination, and contributes to the enhanced photocatalytic performance.44 Meanwhile, the hot electrons with energy level above the Schottky barrier can be reversibly injected into the conduction band of semiconductors (Fig. 5a). In the extreme case, a small portion of hot electrons can tunnel across the energy barrier. This process would reduce the electron density of metal nanostructures, and the surrounding solution and other media may transfer electrons to the metal nanostructures to maintain electrical neutrality in the entire system.

Thanks to the tunable plasmonic features of metal nanostructures, this scheme enables the maximum utilization of solar energy in visible and even infrared light by integrating metal nanostructures with semiconductors. One classical example is the hybrid system between Au/Ag nanoparticles and TiO2 nanostructures. In 2004, Tatsuma et al. found that the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was greatly enhanced under visible-light irradiation by loading Au/Ag nanoparticles onto the TiO2 nanofilm. It is known that the energy of visible light is insufficient to excite the TiO2 semiconductor. It was thus concluded that IPCE enhancement was attributed to the charge transfer that took place from the surface plasmon of Au/Ag nanoparticles excited by visible light to the conduction band of TiO2. The IPCE was a function of incident light wavelength, clearly demonstrating that the surface plasmon of metal nanostructures was the direct reason for electron–hole generation.45,46 Although the specific mechanism remained unclear at that time, the huge enhancement of IPCE boosted the research based on the injection of hot electrons. Apart from the Au–TiO2 system, the hot electron injection could be applied to many other hybrid systems such as Au–ZnO nanowire arrays,47 and Au/Pt/C3N4 nanocomposites,48 which achieved significant photocatalytic performance enhancement. In a typical case, the performance of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution was enhanced 64-fold for TiO2 nanosheets by integrating them with Au nanoparticles.49


Local electromagnetic field enhancement. 
According to the principle of surface plasmons, one can recognize that an intensely enhanced local electromagnetic field would be generated near plasmonic nanostructures under light irradiation. Previous studies have proven that the local electromagnetic field can enhance photocatalytic performance, in which the contribution of direct electron transfer (DET) is excluded by covering metal nanostructures with an insulation layer.50 The insulation layer completely prevents the injection of hot electrons into semiconductors, so the performance enhancement should be ascribed to the field effect. The local electromagnetic field favours the generation and separation of electron–hole pairs in semiconductors (Fig. 5b), whose rates are proportional to field intensities.23 This situation is quite similar to the accelerated motion of ions in an electromagnetic field. However, it should be noted that the local electromagnetic field would not directly excite semiconductors to generate electron–hole pairs. The local electromagnetic field enhancement (LEMF)-induced charge separation only works for the incident photons with energies above the bandgap of semiconductors.
In the LEMF mechanism, it is worth mentioning that the metal–semiconductor interface can provide an enhanced electromagnetic field. The electromagnetic field rapidly decays with the distance, and the working distance is few nanometers.50 The direct contact between the metal and the semiconductor substantially reduces the distance and enhances photocatalytic performance. In addition to the distance, increasing the contact area between the metal and the semiconductor is another effective approach for a good coupling of the electromagnetic field with the semiconductor, which further enhances the electron–hole generation.51 In the case of direct contact, the effects from hot electrons and local electromagnetic field enhancement are inevitably entangled in a photocatalytic system, which forms an obstacle to justifying the mechanism that plays a leading role.


Resonant energy transfer. 
Apart from hot electron injection (Fig. 5a) and local electromagnetic field enhancement (Fig. 5b), surface plasmons can also work for semiconductor-based photocatalysis through resonant energy transfer (RET) as long as the plasmonic band overlaps the spectrum of semiconductor light absorption. As mentioned above, the local electromagnetic field enhancement mechanism only acts at the energy level above the bandgap of the semiconductor by improving charge separation. As compared with the LEMF, RET is a process which directly generates electron–hole pairs in semiconductors through the relaxation of localized surface plasmon dipoles.52,53
Here we take metal@SiO2@TiO2 (metal refers to Au or Ag nanosphere) core–shell nanostructures as an example to illustrate the possible mechanism. To resolve the concentration changes of carriers created by surface plasmon in semiconductors, transient absorption spectroscopy was employed to examine the system. In this system, the plasmonic band of Ag was partly overlapped with the absorption band of TiO2 while there was no overlap between Au and TiO2. The SiO2 interlayer was used to effectively shield the hot electron injection from the metal surface to TiO2. It turned out that Ag@SiO2@TiO2 enabled resonance energy transfer using visible light irradiation. In sharp contrast, no energy transfer was observed for Au@SiO2@TiO2 core–shell nanoparticles due to the lack of optical overlap.54
As compared with LEMF, light harvesting via the RET mechanism can be extended to longer wavelengths, making it possible to utilize visible and near-infrared light. For instance, Xiong and co-workers designed a N-doped TiO2 bowl array–Au hybrid system, in which the light absorption of TiO2 was tuned by N doping to overlap the plasmonic band of Au nanoparticles.55 With charge generation and separation enhanced by RET, the hybrid system achieved the hydrogen evolution rate of 0.637 mmol g−1 h−1 in the full spectrum, which well exceeded those of bare TiO2 bowl arrays in the full spectrum (0.07 mmol g−1 h−1) and N-doped TiO2–Au arrays under ultraviolet irradiation (0.256 mmol g−1 h−1) (Fig. 5e).

3.2 Applications in photocatalysis
The integration of semiconductors with plasmonic nanostructures for photocatalysis recently has made remarkable progress in water splitting and artificial photosynthesis. Metal nanoparticles greatly boosted photocatalytic efficiencies through hot electron injection and field-related mechanisms.

Water splitting. 
Water splitting driven by solar energy is a promising approach to solve the current energy crisis and environmental pollution.1 In this system, semiconductors are photoexcited to generate electron–hole pairs which can be separated and used for hydrogen and oxygen evolution, respectively. In the past years, the semiconductors integrated with plasmonic nanostructures have shown enhanced photocatalytic performance in hydrogen or oxygen evolution,8 including Au–TiO2 dumbbell-like nanorods,56 Au–ZnO nanorods arrays,57 Au-decorated Ta2O5/Ta3N5 nanoparticles,58 Ag-modified BiOCl nanosheets,59 Au–CdS hierarchical structures,60 and Au@Cu2ZnSnS4 core–shell nanoparticles.61 For instance, anatase TiO2 nanosheets with exposed (001) facets achieved 64-fold enhancement in solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency by incorporating 6 nm Au nanoparticles.49 Zhao et al. reported an all-solid-state g-C3N4/Au/P25 Z-scheme hybrid system for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, which exhibited a 30 times higher activity than pristine g-C3N4.62 Yu et al. modified ZnS nanoflowers with Au nanoparticles at 0.4 wt% to achieve an impressive hydrogen evolution rate of 3306 μmol h−1 g−1.63
Overall, the photocatalytic performance enhancement by plasmonic metal nanoparticles can be attributed to the three mechanisms outlined in Section 3.1. Specifically, the advantages can be summarized: (1) the plasmonic nanostructures extend the light absorption of photocatalysts to visible and near-infrared regions; (2) the local electromagnetic field or dipole–dipole interaction enhances the generation and separation of electron–hole pairs in semiconductors; (3) the hot electrons derived from surface plasmon resonance are injected into the conduction band of semiconductors and provide additional carriers for photocatalytic reactions; and (4) the Schottky barrier naturally formed at the metal–semiconductor interface traps photoexcited electrons on metal for surface reduction reactions. In a special case, whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonances can extend light absorption to the entire visible region by carefully arranging Au nanoparticles.64
Indeed, harvesting visible and near-infrared light is essentially important for photocatalysis as it occupies a large proportion of solar photons. Taking TiO2 as an example, the bandgap of 3.2 eV limits its light absorption to the ultraviolet region. The implementation of plasmonic metal nanostructures into photocatalysis can greatly improve the utilization efficiency of long-wavelength light. Xiong et al. integrated multiple plasmonic and co-catalyst metal nanostructures with TiO2 nanosheets for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Au nanocubes and nanocages endow the hybrid system with the capability of harvesting visible and near-infrared light, respectively. Together with the Pd nanocube as a cocatalyst, the hybrid system showed dramatically higher activity than its counterparts.65
The plasmonic effects not only work for the hydrogen evolution reaction, but are also used for the other half reaction in water splitting (i.e., oxygen evolution). The oxygen evolution is the bottleneck for water splitting due to its ultraslow reaction kinetics. Xiong et al. designed a system by integrating Ag and Pd nanocubes on the different facets of BiOCl nanosheets (Fig. 6a). In this system, carrier trapping by the Schottky junction was synergized with plasmonic hot carrier injection for photocatalytic performance enhancement by selecting two different semiconductor facets for interfacing with metals. Further integrated with the local electromagnetic field enhancement of charge separation in semiconductor by plasmonics, the hybrid system performance achieved an about 7-fold enhancement in photocatalytic oxygen evolution (Fig. 6b).59 Kominami et al. designed a Pt/Au/WO3 photocatalyst, in which the surface plasmon was coupled with the excitation of WO3, which enhanced both oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions under visible light irradiation.66 Plasmonic effects can also contribute to photoelectrochemical water oxidation.67 Moskovits et al. designed TiO2-coated Au nanorod arrays as photoanodes for water splitting using visible light. They achieved 20-fold production efficiency enhancement under visible light as compared with UV irradiation.68 The noble metals (Au, Ag) could be replaced by cheap metals such as Al in the core-multishell nanowires that were used as photoelectrodes for water splitting, in which Al plasmonics enhanced visible light absorption.69

Carbon dioxide reduction. 
The photo-generated electrons can also be used for carbon dioxide reduction. The reduction of CO2 to hydrocarbon fuels is highly important for the development of sustainable energy as well as for providing an approach to carbon neutrality. As compared with proton reduction, CO2 reduction is a more complicated process which may produce CO, formic acid, methanol or methane by multiple-electron transfer reactions as listed below: CO2 + 2H2O → CH4 + 2O2(1) 2CO2 + 4H2O → 2CH3OH + 3O2(2) 2CO2 + 2H2O → 2CHOOH + O2(3)
Apparently the selectivity of products is the key to CO2 reduction. It is extremely desirable to obtain fuel molecules such as methanol and methane with high selectivity. In the past years, it has been demonstrated that integration of plasmonic nanostructures with semiconductors can effectively improve the photocatalytic performance. Here we still take the classical Au–TiO2 hybrid system as an example, whose energy level diagram is shown in Fig. 7a–c. As compared with the widely used TiO2, 24-fold enhancement has been achieved by this hybrid system for the reduction of photocatalytic CO2 to methane (Fig. 7d), which can be attributed to the intensely enhanced local electromagnetic field offered by Au nanostructures. The field enhancement greatly improved the sub-bandgap absorption in TiO2. As incident light was switched to the ultraviolet region with high intensity, the d-band electrons were excited and possessed a higher redox potential. Yet it was insufficient to drive CO2 reduction with a light irradiation wavelength of 365 nm (Fig. 7b). When the light wavelength was further shifted to 254 nm, the reduction products such as CH3OH or C2H6 were obtained because the d-band electrons on Au nanostructures were excited and possessed higher energy than the redox potentials for CH3OH and C2H6 (Fig. 7c).70

Certainly the product selectivity is not only related to the energy level of electrons, but also depends on the compositions of reaction sites. In a metal–semiconductor hybrid structure, metal nanostructures may also act as co-catalysts by trapping electrons. For this reason, the metal composition (e.g., Au, Ag or Cu) significantly affects the selectivity of CO2 reduction.71–76 Surface plasmons can also be adapted for other hybrid systems, such as Au–Cu alloy-loaded SrTiO3/TiO2 coaxial nanotube arrays,77 Ag–SrTiO3 nanoparticles,78 Au–ZnO nanoparticles,79 and Ag-modified ZnGa2O4,80 to enhance CO2 reduction performance. In a special case, the Ag-loaded ALa4Ti4O15 (A = Ca, Sr, and Ba) layered perovskite structures yielded the majority consisting of CO, accompanied by a small amount of HCOOH rather than H2 in an aqueous medium. This manifests a promising catalyst for CO2 reduction.81


Degradation of the organic pollutant. 
Photocatalytic H2 evolution and CO2 reduction both utilized the photoexcited electrons for reduction reactions, while the holes were consumed by H2O oxidation or sacrificial agents. In the past decades, the photoexcited holes have also been used for the degradation of organic pollutants owing to their strong oxidation ability. In addition to the Schottky junction, the integration of semiconductors with plasmonic nanostructures offers an intense local electromagnetic field to accelerate interband transition and to promote the separation of electron-hole pairs, which greatly enhances the performance for organic pollutant degradation. For example, Li et al. reported that TiO2 nanotubes decorated with Au nanoparticles showed enhanced photocatalytic degradation ability for methyl orange. The Au nanoparticles not only offer visible light absorption, but also promote electron–hole separation.82 Balakumar et al. designed a hybrid system by assembling ZnO–Ag core–shell nanoparticles on graphene nanosheets, in which Ag shells provide plasmonic properties in favour of charge separation. As a result, the hybrid system demonstrated tremendous enhancement in the photocatalytic degradation of acridine orange.83
Overall, the photocatalytic performance enhancement by plasmonic nanostructures can be attributed to the three major mechanisms. However, it is very challenging to assign a case to a specific working mechanism as the complex structure, energy level, irradiation wavelength and many other factors often make several mechanisms mixed together. In order to establish the corresponding relationship between specific structures and working mechanisms, we outline the materials design for surface plasmon enhancement in various photocatalytic reactions as well as the corresponding mechanisms in Table 1.

4. Plasmonic nanostructures for photovoltaics
Photovoltaics (PV), another approach to solar energy conversion, is a promising technique to generate electricity from solar energy. Thus far, photovoltaics based on monocrystalline silicon, quantum dot84 and perovskite structure85 devices has made significant progress. Currently, a low-cost approach uses very thin layers (typically 1–2 μm) of absorber materials in PV cells, referred to as “thin-film PV”. However, such reduction in the absorber thickness greatly compromises the efficiency of the device due to relatively poor light absorption, in particular, for indirect-bandgap semiconductor crystalline silicon. For this reason, it is crucial to develop solutions to efficiently harvest or trap light for the continued applications of low-cost PV modules. As a matter of fact, harvesting light in a broad spectrum is also highly important for all PV devices. A variety of approaches have been developed to improve power conversion efficiency, among which the integration of photovoltaic devices with plasmonic nanostructures has proven to be an efficient way.
4.1 Mechanisms
In nature, the photovoltaic devices integrated with plasmonic nanostructures may work similarly to the cases of photocatalysis. The working mechanisms for photocatalysis and photovoltaic devices require two common steps in the following processes – light harvesting, and charge generation and separation. In both applications, the integration of plasmonic nanostructures with semiconductors can extend light absorption to the visible and near-infrared regions. Moreover, the enhanced local electromagnetic field by surface plasmon can effectively suppress the recombination of photoexcited electrons and holes in semiconductors. However, the surface plasmon may play additional roles in solid-state photovoltaic devices such as scattering for light trapping. Here we will outline the possible working mechanisms for plasmonic nanostructures in photovoltaics.

Light trapping. 
Light trapping is an effective approach to improve the light absorption of solar cells. For conventional Si solar cells with thick absorbers, light trapping is usually achieved using a surface texture method which can change the light traveling directions into solar cells.86 However, this approach is not suitable for thin-film photovoltaic devices due to the increased charge recombination that occurs in the conventional surface texture method. The integration of plasmonics into PV technologies, which uses nanostructured metal materials to guide and localize light at the nanoscale, can increase light absorption and therefore PV cell efficiency without the need to radically redesign devices.
When metallic nanoparticles are placed on the surface of semiconductors (Fig. 8a), part of the incident light will be scattered into the semiconductor as the semiconductor has larger permittivity.87 The incident light scattered into the semiconductor will be scattered again when it strikes on the back side of metal nanoparticles, until the light reaches the critical angle of 16° for the Si–air interface. In some photovoltaic devices equipped with reflecting metal on the back, the reflected light will be scattered via the same mechanism. As a result, the optical path length will be increased to trap incident light similarly to the surface texture method. For a non-spherical plasmonic nanostructure, the orientation of the nanoparticle would have an impact on light scattering, which may maximize the amount of light scattered into semiconductors and thus improve the photovoltaic efficiency.88
 Fig. 8  Schematics illustrating the plasmonic light trapping for thin-film solar cells. (a) Light trapping by the scattering from metal nanoparticles. (b) Light trapping by the excitation of a localized surface plasmon in metal nanoparticles embedded in the semiconductor. (c) Light trapping by the excitation of surface plasmon polaritons at the metal–semiconductor interface. Adapted with permission from ref. 9. Copyright 2010 Nature Publishing Group. 
Light trapping by scattering of metal nanostructures will increase the photocurrents of PV devices. For example, Stuart and Hall designed Ag nanoparticle arrays to scatter light into Si photodetectors, which achieved a nearly 20-fold enhancement of photocurrents in the near-infrared region.89 This strategy based on light scattering achieves a grand success for various systems including a narrow-bandgap organic solar cell.18
Light trapping can also be achieved by the metallic nanoparticles embedded in semiconductors, which concentrate incident light in the form of surface plasmons. As shown in Fig. 8b, the metal nanoparticle works as an antenna to intensely absorb incident light and localize the sunlight energy on the metal nanoparticle surface with a time scale of 10–50 fs. This working mechanism works well especially for small nanoparticles with a diameter of 5–20 nm as the small nanoparticles have low reflectivity and the carriers are collected in a timely way by a current collector. This light trapping by a localized surface plasmon has been proven to be effective in polymer solar cells,90 thin-film Si solar cells and other systems.
The third light trapping mechanism by a plasmon converts incident light into surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) with the help of periodic corrugated nanostructures on the back metal as shown in Fig. 8c. SPPs are electromagnetic waves which transverse propagation along the metal–semiconductor interface. At a frequency near the plasmon resonance, the SPP is excited to turn the incident solar flux by 90°, allowing light absorption along the lateral direction of the PV cell. This increases the light propagation length, finally enhancing the PV device performance.


Hot electrons. 
As discussed in Section 3.1, surface plasmon decay can generate and inject hot electrons into the conduction band of the semiconductor and enhance photocatalytic performance. For photovoltaic devices, power conversion efficiency is largely restricted by limited light absorption in the visible and infrared regions. Metal nanostructures such as Au and Ag that offer plasmonic bands in visible and near-infrared regions can serve as antennae for light harvesting and convert it to hot electrons. Combined with the semiconductor, the plasmonic nanostructures make it possible to fully utilize solar energy.91
However, it should be noted that the efficiency of solar cells based on plasmonic hot electron injection is far below the theoretical efficiency. For instance, the maximum efficiency for dye-sensitized solar cells based on hot electron generation is only 10.6%.92 Lian et al. found that the low efficiency was caused by the loss of hot electrons via ultrafast electron-electron scattering. The bottleneck can be overcome by directly exciting the electrons of the metal to the semiconductor via a close-knit metal–semiconductor interface. This plasmon-induced interfacial charge transfer greatly improved the efficiency to 24%.93 Xiong's group proposed a strategy for integrating Si nanowire arrays with Ag nanoplates which absorbed and converted near-infrared light into hot electrons (Fig. 9). The hot electrons were then injected into the conduction band of Si nanowires. This approach effectively utilized the near-infrared light for PV devices, and external quantum efficiency was improved to 59%.94

Local electromagnetic field enhancement. 
Like the case of photocatalysis, the generation of photoexcited electrons and holes can be promoted by coupling solar cells with the local electromagnetic field, which is confined on the surface of metal nanoparticles. For example, in the system in which CdSe quantum dots and Ag nanoparticles were separated by an Al2O3 layer, a local electromagnetic field substantially restrained the recombination of electrons and holes.95 For photovoltaic devices, the enhanced local electromagnetic field can contribute to the enhancement of photocurrents and power conversion efficiencies.

4.2 Applications in photovoltaics
Various PV devices have been integrated with plasmonic nanostructures for improved PV performance. Here we name a few examples to demonstrate the functions of surface plasmons in PV technologies.

Silicon solar cells. 
Silicon solar cells are the first generation of photovoltaic devices as silicon has high natural abundance and excellent reliability. Integrating silicon PVs with plasmonic nanostructures can substantially improve light absorption in visible and near-infrared regions. For example, Green et al. found that the entire spectral absorption of thin-film Si solar cells was enhanced by the surface plasmon of Ag nanoparticles. It achieved about 7-fold and 16-fold enhancement when the plasmonic bands were overlapped with the Si bandgap at 1200 nm and 1050 nm, respectively.96 Yang et al. investigated the impact of surface plasmons on photovoltaic performance using a single nanowire of monocrystalline silicon as a model which was decorated with octahedral Ag nanoparticles. The single-nanowire model largely simplified the case. As such, they revealed that photocurrents increased at the wavelength close to the surface plasmon resonance of Ag nanoparticles, to which the interaction of the semiconductor with dipolar and quadrupolar plasmon resonances made contributions.97


Perovskite-structured solar cells. 
Organic–inorganic perovskite structures have shown promising prospects in PV technologies owing to their high charge transport and quantum efficiencies. Plasmonic nanostructures have been proven to be useful in enhancing the power conversion efficiency for perovskite solar cells. Snaith et al. designed perovskite solar cells for integration with Ag@TiO2 core–shell nanoparticles, which boosted the power conversion efficiency to 16.3% as the metal nanoparticles could enhance the radiative decay and re-absorb the emitted photons.98 Gu et al. developed perovskite solar cells by integrating Ag nanoparticles on the back surface of the perovskite layer. This integrated system achieved 4-fold photocurrent enhancement on a 10 nm ultrathin perovskite layer. The Ag nanoparticles offered light trapping by scattering, and their local electromagnetic field also contributed to the photocurrent enhancement.99


Quantum-dot solar cells. 
The power conversion efficiency of quantum-dot solar cells can also be improved using plasmonic nanostructures. Wang et al. incorporated multispiked Au nanostructures into InAs quantum-dot solar cells to dramatically boost the PV performance, which should be attributed to scattering by Au nanostars in a broad spectrum.100 In order to fully utilize near-infrared light, Ag nanocubes were implemented in the solar cells that were fabricated with PdS quantum dots and ZnO nanowire arrays. The Ag nanocubes offered a plasmonic band complementary to the light absorption of PdS quantum dots. As a result, the power conversion efficiency was improved from 4.45% to 6.03%.101
In order to emphasize the relationship of materials design and the working mechanism for PV device applications, the material structures and PV device performance enhancement in specific cases are summarized in Table 2, together with their corresponding mechanisms.

5. Conclusions and future prospects
Plasmonic nanostructures can serve as antennae to concentrate light for photocatalysis and photovoltaics, which become more efficient in converting solar light into chemical energy and electricity, respectively. In this article, we reviewed recent progress in the use of plasmonic nanostructures for enhanced photocatalytic and photovoltaic performance, with the mechanisms behind practical applications including light trapping, hot electron injection, local electromagnetic field enhancement and resonant energy transfer. The surface plasmon used for photocatalysis and photovoltaics shares most working mechanisms but shows a slight difference due to their different detailed systems and limitations.
Despite the grand progress, there still remain many challenges in this research field. First of all, it is a very complicated system for the integration of semiconductors with plasmonic metals. In this system, the physical parameters of metal nanostructures (e.g., work function, plasmonic band, surface facet) and semiconductors (e.g., band structure, surface facet) and the manner of integration all have a great impact on the plasmon-enhanced performance. Tailoring all the parameters is a highly systematic task which calls for advanced synthesis and fabrication techniques. In particular, the interface between semiconductors and plasmonic nanostructures holds the key to the energy or electron transfer between two components.
Until now, the mechanism that is dominant in certain situations still eludes us, and there is a lack of powerful techniques or ideal model systems to distinguish one from the other. It is thus imperative to perform research at the intersection of controlled synthesis, advanced characterization and theoretical simulation. Specifically, we need characterization techniques to resolve the involved processes at high spatial and temporal resolutions and at electronic/molecular levels.
The future studies will enable a better understanding of the nature of surface plasmon effects on the enhancement of photocatalysis and photovoltaic performance. Nevertheless, toward practical applications, scalability and cost would be two key factors that urge us to develop synthesis and fabrication methods at the large scale and with high uniformity. The remaining challenges mean that many opportunities are around the corner; the research community would find it interesting to further exploit plasmonic nanostructures for photocatalytic and photovoltaic applications from both fundamental and technical perspectives.
