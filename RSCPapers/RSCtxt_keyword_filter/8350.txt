    , Accepted 10th April 2022First published on 22nd April 2022AbstractSingle crystal studies provide a better understanding of the basic properties of organic photovoltaic devices. Therefore, in this work, rubrene single crystals with a thickness of 250 nm to 1000 nm were used to produce an inverted bilayer organic solar cell. Subsequently, polycrystalline rubrene (orthorhombic, triclinic) and amorphous bilayer solar cells of the same thickness as single crystals were studied to make comparisons across platforms. To investigate how single crystal, polycrystalline (triclinic-orthorhombic) and amorphous forms alter the charge carrier recombination mechanism at the rubrene/PCBM interface, light intensity measurements were carried out. The light intensity dependency of the JSC, VOC and FF parameters in organic solar cells with different forms of rubrene was determined. Monomolecular (Shockley Read Hall) recombination is observed in devices employing amorphous and polycrystalline rubrene in addition to bimolecular recombination, whereas the single crystal device is weakly affected by trap assisted SRH recombination due to reduced trap states at the donor acceptor interface. To date, the proposed work is the only systematic study examining transport and interface recombination mechanisms in organic solar cells produced by different structure forms of rubrene.
1. Introduction
Organic semiconductor single crystals are powerful tools for probing the intrinsic properties of materials and provide a way to improve the steady electronic device operation.1 To study the charge transport mechanism and achieve a high performance-device, single crystals can be operated as a prototype model since they have a regular shape, and almost no grain boundaries, dislocations, or defects.2,3 Their high mobilities and outstanding electrical characteristics would make them promising candidates for optoelectronic applications, such as in organic field effect transistors (OFET), phototransistors, pn heterojunctions and electronic circuits as drivers for active matrix displays and sensor arrays.4,5 Yet, for all their work in the field of organic electronics, there are few examples of them being utilized in photovoltaic studies due to processing difficulties. Rubrene (5,6,11,12-tetraphenyltetracene; C42H28), a benchmark semiconductor, has exhibited one of the highest mobilities (40 cm2 Vs−1) in the single crystal form and is a very commonly employed material for studying interactions of external stimuli with organic semiconductors.6 For instance, rubrene single crystal based OFETs have been extensively examined regarding the charge transport mechanism, anisotropic and mechanical properties. On the other hand, solar cell studies with rubrene organic single crystals are limited due to their hard handling process, fragility and poor processability causing some difficulties for device fabrication. Recently, one of the outstanding studies on a rubrene single crystal solar cell was the study of Karak et al., which investigated the intrinsic interface properties of ITO/rubrene single crystal/Al in lateral Schottky devices.7 Although, the charge carrier mobility of rubrene the thin film form is not so good because of poor crystallinity,8 detailed understanding of its processing conditions allow the fabrication of very well controlled polycrystalline films.9 Exploiting the epitaxial growth of rubrene onto a thin film enabled the first fabrication of a polycrystalline photovoltaic device.10 There are some studies that examine the effect of different crystal phases formed using different annealing temperatures on charge transfer states. Amassian et al. have shown how the structural heterogeneities of rubrene thin films effect the CT state and VOC in conventional solar cells.11 However, there is still a significant lack of studies on the systematic variation from amorphous, semi-crystalline and single crystal forms of rubrene based organic solar cells and the effects on the interfacial transport mechanism. In this study, we first, have fabricated inverted organic photovoltaic devices using rubrene single crystals and investigated device performance as a function of crystal thickness. Then, comparisons were made between platforms by producing polycrystalline orthorhombic, triclinic, and amorphous devices with the same thickness as the single crystal. To investigate how single crystal and amorphous/polycrystalline forms affect the charge carrier transport at the rubrene/PCBM interface, we have realized light intensity measurements, providing comprehensive information on bulk or interface recombination. To the best of our knowledge, the recombination mechanism in terms of monomolecular and bimolecular recombination and detailed solar cell device performance have not been investigated across platforms from the single crystalline to amorphous form of rubrene in inverted bilayer organic solar cells.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Rubrene crystal growth
A physical vapor transport (PVT) system was used to fabricate rubrene single crystals. Commercially available rubrene powder (Acros Organics-Purity with 99.99%), which is used as the source material, was placed on a cleaned glass sleeve inside the PVT system. Thin rubrene single crystals could be grown by fast sublimation rate conditions, where the source temperature was ∼330 °C under inert gas (argon) flow with a rate of about 100 mL min−1. A Zeiss AxioCam ICc1 camera was used to obtain the optical microscope images.
2.2. Solar cell fabrication
Commercially available ITO-coated glasses were used as a substrate. After the usual cleaning process (15 min water, acetone, and isopropanol), the substrates were exposed to UV-ozone treatment to activate the surfaces for 3 minutes. C60-N, which is dissolved in 2,2,2-Trifluoroethanol (TFE) 0.4%, was deposited onto ITO glasses as an interlayer by spin coating at 4000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 75 °C for 5 min. After that, PCBM solution, which is dissolved in 0.5 wt % chlorobenzene, was spin-coated as an electron transport layer at 4000 rpm for 40 s and annealed at 80 °C for 5 min to evaporate residual solvents. Rubrene single crystals were placed onto the PCBM coated surface by using a PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) stamp to raise adhesion between the crystal and PCBM surface. The thicknesses of the C60-N and PCBM layers are 15 nm and 35 nm, respectively. Finally, 100 nm Ag (99.99% purity) and 8 nm MoO3, which is was reported as a electron blocker, were thermally evaporated as anode electrodes by a glovebox-integrated PVD system.
2.3. Device characterizations
All measurements were completed in a MBraun M200 glovebox system under a nitrogen atmosphere. A glovebox-integrated Newport solar simulator was used as an AM 1.5 light source. Photocurrent and voltage characterizations were done by a Keithley 4200 source meter. The absorption spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-3600 Spectrophotometer. The optical microscopy (Zeiss Axiovert 200M, 5x or 10x objective, CCD camera) with ImageJ was used to get single crystal optical images. Crystal thickness was obtained using an optical profilometer (Zygo NewView 7300, Veeco DekTak 150, and Veeco NT9080). The XRD experiments were conducted by a Panalytical Empyrean X-ray diffractometer. The surface morphology of rubrene films was examined using tapping mode AFM (Ambios technology).
3. Results and discussion
A schematic of the single-crystal solar cell is shown in Fig. 1a. Rubrene is the selected donor to fabricate a working inverted bilayer organic solar cell. The device structure comprised a C60-N (fulleropyrrolidines with amine) interlayer coated ITO substrate. PCBM (Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester) is the selected acceptor, which is commonly used in the solution processed form. The PCBM film was then spin coated, as it created better adherence with the rubrene crystal than C60-N. A 250 nm rubrene single crystal was then placed onto the PCBM film. This type of crystal (with thicknesses below 1 micron) is naturally bendable and bonds with the PCBM surface through van der Waals forces. The XRD pattern of the Rubrene single crystal produced by the PVT (Physical vapor transport) method is shown in Fig. 1b. The diffraction peaks are sharp and peak at 6.55° corresponding with the (002) crystal plane and other equivalent periodic peaks with high intensity corresponding to (004), (008) and others are also in agreement with the literature.12 An optical image of the completed single-crystal device is shown in Fig. 1c. The dark and illuminated current voltage characteristics of the rubrene single crystal solar cell can be seen in Fig. 1d. Under solar illumination equivalent to one sun, the champion device exhibited a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 0.30 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.60 V, a fill factor of 0.57 and the resulting PCE of 0.10%. Here, the notable difference between the dark current density and the photogenerated current density at V > VOC could be explained by the electronic doping mechanism, which is originated from asymmetrical impurities (or defect levels) between the donor (Rubrene Single crystal/no impurities) and acceptor (PCBM thin film) layers.13 A variety of single-crystal devices were fabricated to investigate the effect of the crystal thickness on the PCE. Devices tested ranged from 250 nm to 1000 nm, with PCE decreasing from 0.1% at 250 nm to 0.01% at 1000 nm. Table S1 shows the illuminated solar cell device parameters as a function of crystal thickness. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the VOC did not show a big dependence on the crystal thickness since they have similar photovoltaic properties in terms of energy levels. In addition, in devices with thicker crystals, slight VOC drops could be related to charge recombination.14 The small dependence of FF on crystal thickness can be explained by better cohesion of thinner crystals. JSC is relatively sensitive to thickness compared to the decrease in VOC and FF, which reduced from 0.3 mA cm−2 at 250 nm to 0.062 mA cm−2 at a crystal thicknesses of 1000 nm. This result was also confirmed by the serial resistance results calculated from the dark current voltage graph, which increased more than one order of magnitude, from 18 Ω cm2 to 205 Ω cm2 for 250 nm and 1000 nm, respectively. This performance decrease could be caused by the difference in flexibility of the thin and thick crystals, as the thin crystals better adhered and conformed to the substrate, creating a pin hole-free interface. The optical microscope images of varied thickness rubrene single crystals can be seen in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Thicker crystals have not adhered to the surface properly giving rise to a detrimental interface for solar cell operation. In addition to adhesion problems, the JSC decreasing could be explained in two ways: 1 – the incident excitation light intensity reduced with increasing crystal thickness15 (especially up to 500 nm), which limits the density of photogenerated carriers and 2 - the thicker crystals are larger than the exciton diffusion length suppressing charge collection compared with thinner crystals. Also, there is another distinction between the photocurrents of thin (L = 250 nm) and thick (L = 1000 nm) crystals that could be coming from space charge effects, since photogenerated holes need to transit a longer pathway than the drift lengths in thick crystals, paving the way for charge carrier recombination.16 These reasons could be evidence of a big JSC drop for solar cells with the 1000 nm rubrene single crystal. Nevertheless, this reduced performance is much less than previous studies using tetracene single crystals in which PCE decreased by three orders of magnitude when the crystal thickness was varied over a similar range.17 This could be caused by larger exciton diffusion lengths and higher carrier mobility in the rubrene crystals that allow for more effective free carrier generation and collection.18 Additionally, fabrication of thinner rubrene single crystals than 250 nm by PVT is difficult owing to the random production process, challenging transfer to the substrate and them not being large enough to use in vertical solar cells because of getting anode contact. Our results could be offering a proof of concept of large area single crystals for organic photovoltaic devices. The thickness-optimized single crystal device could be a powerful platform to compare to differing polycrystalline and amorphous rubrene films and characterize the effect of molecular packing and crystallinity on the recombination mechanism. To match the fabrication steps of the single crystal device, a 250 nm rubrene layer was thermally evaporated onto the PCBM layer (Fig. S2, ESI†). The as-deposited layer was amorphous, and subsequently crystallized through abrupt thermal annealing without de-wetting. This annealing was carried out by placing the as deposited rubrene film on a pre-heated hot plate in a nitrogen environment. Amorphous surfaces were annealed at 130 °C for 5 minutes and 170 °C for 3 minutes to fabricate polycrystalline triclinic and orthorhombic films, respectively. In addition to the silver metal contact, we deposited MoOx to fabricate an inverted bilayer organic solar cell to achieve better hole collection and get rid of little cracks upon annealing of rubrene, which can restrain device operation. To understand the topological variation between the single crystal, polycrystal and amorphous forms of rubrene, we have performed atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. Fig. 3a shows that the image of 250 nm single crystalline rubrene with just a single terrace has a smooth and uniform surface exhibiting a monomolecular step, which is composed of rubrene single crystal on the c-axis.19 To determine the evolution of the crystalline structures upon heat treatment, we examined amorphous and triclinic-polycrystalline and orthorhombic polycrystalline features. Fig. 3b shows that the AFM image of the amorphous rubrene surface did not exhibit any crystalline feature. After abrupt heating at a relatively low temperature of 130 °C for 5 min, disc-shaped crystalline features were displayed indicating homogeneously covered crystalline surfaces, as shown in Fig. 3c.20Fig. 3d shows the orthorhombic crystallized surface of rubrene film on PCBM after thermal heating at 170 °C. Here, orthorhombic crystals were oriented with the c-axis perpendicular to the substrate.10,21,22 The growth-rate of the crystal grains and also the thickness of the film effect the crystallization type.23,24 At higher annealing temperatures, circular crystals are reinforcing the transition to the branch-like crystals9 as seen in Fig. 3d. Surface profile mapping and 3D surface imaging of amorphous and triclinic-polycrystalline and orthorhombic polycrystalline features are illustrated in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Furthermore, the absorption spectra of PCBM and rubrene polymorphs films and X-ray diffraction peaks of rubrene amorphous, rubrene-triclinic and rubrene-orthorhombic polycrystalline forms have been investigated, as shown in Fig. 3e–f. As can be seen in Fig. 3e, the PCBM had an absorption peak maximum at 445 nm and characteristic absorption at approximately 300 nm. The PCBM/Rubrene triclinic interface shows the same absorption spectrum, which is stronger than PCBM/rubrene-orthorhombic. The rubrene amorphous/triclinic and orthorhombic polymorphous forms show a similar absorption response and they exhibited an absorption range of 475–545 nm with an edge of 575 nm. The PCBM/Rubrene-Orthorhombic and PCBM/Rubrene triclinic interface show nearly the same absorption spectrum, which is stronger than that of PCBM/rubrene-amorphous (Fig. S4, ESI†). This result represents an improvement over the photocurrent of PCBM/Rubrene-Orthorhombic and PCBM/Rubrene triclinic bilayer systems. The XRD pattern of the rubrene polymorphs can be seen in Fig. 3f. The XRD result of the rubrene-amorphous film exhibits only a glass background signal. The XRD peaks of rubrene-triclinic and rubrene
orthorhombic crystalline grains correspond to characteristic peaks,25,26 which is determined by the general structure analysis system (GSAS)27 and taking the standard CMCA setting.28,29

Photovoltaic device performances and parameters have been investigated in ITO/C60-N/PCBM/Rubrene/MoOx/Ag for different systems with rubrene crystalline forms. Illuminated and dark J–V characteristics are shown in Fig. 4a and b and the photovoltaic device parameters have been summarized in Table 1. Open circuit voltage (VOC) and short circuit current (JSC) are extracted from illuminated J–V data. The VOC has changed from 880 mV for amorphous rubrene to 600 mV for single crystalline rubrene. It is well known that the HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) level of amorphous-rubrene is deeper than the HOMO level of the Rubrene single crystal (about 0.4 eV). Since the VOC of the organic solar cell was found by calculating the difference between the HOMO level of the donor and the LUMO level (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) of the acceptor, a part of this VOC drop can be explained with distinction between the HOMO energy levels of the amorphous and single crystalline form.30–33 The single crystalline rubrene VOC which is acquired in this work matched very similar to that of Rand and coworkers10 and there homoepitaxially grown rubrene layer. On the other hand, the VOC trend of the polycrystalline and amorphous devices follows a similar trend previously reported by Amassian and coworkers11 in which they saw a decrease in VOC from amorphous, triclinic, to orthorhombic in that order. The annealing of donor layers that are rather thick can cause such an abrupt decrease of VOC. In addition, increased crystalline forms lead to energetic modification of the charge transfer state of the donor/acceptor interface and effect the Fermi energy level splitting resulting in VOC variation.11,34 Besides, it is known that VOC as a device parameter is determined from recombination mechanisms, especially non-radiative recombination existing in the device which is discussed in depth in the light intensity section.35 According to the overall performance of rubrene based solar cells, the PCE results of single crystal devices are still lower than those of the evaporated rubrene thin film devices because of higher transparency of thin crystals. On the other hand, JSC, VOC and FF variations for rubrene based organic solar cells need to be explained by the charge recombination mechanism in terms of limiting charge collection systems.36 Recombination in organic solar cells is mostly nonlinear in charge-carrier density37,38 and therefore the device parameters depend on the light intensity, which is frequently used in the assay of bimolecular recombination in the field of organic photovoltaics.39–41 Because of these reasons, in our work, to clarify the performance variation between the single crystal/polymorphs/amorphous solar cells, the recombination mechanism at the rubrene/PCBM interface has been investigated using the light intensity dependence of the J–V characteristics. In Fig. S5, (ESI†) the J–V behaviours of devices under different light intensities (ranging from 10 mW cm−2 to 140 mW cm−2) are exhibited. Using these J–V graphs of solar cells, we have extracted the solar cell parameters such as open circuit voltage (VOC), short circuit current (JSC), and fill factor (FF) for each light intensity to analyze the charge carrier recombination. It is very well accepted that, at open circuit conditions, all the photogenerated charge carries are balanced, and the net total current is zero in solar cell devices. In this case, the recombination mechanism can be determined by the following equation,42  where q is the elementary charge, k is the Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature in Kelvin and n is the ideality factor introducing the dominant type of recombination mechanism. The linearity of VOCversus the light intensity (log) graph, (the slope is equal to kT/q (n = 1)) represents bimolecular recombination whereas the stronger dependency of VOC on light intensity refers to the presence of another additional recombination mechanism such as trap assisted, which is termed monomolecular recombination. Fig. 4c displays that the VOC value varies with light intensity, where the slope is 1.56 kT/q, 1.66 kT/q, 1.77 kT/q and 2.02 kT/q for single crystal, orthorhombic, triclinic, and amorphous, respectively. The stronger dependence of VOC on light intensity (1 < n < 2) implies a superposition of monomolecular and bimolecular recombination.43 For the amorphous rubrene solar cell device, the slope value reaches 2.02 kT/q, indicating that the trap-assisted mechanism is mostly involved, which can be defined by free electrons and holes preferring to recombine through trap states or recombination centres, resulting from interfacial defects and impurities in materials.44 The slope values of orthorhombic and triclinic crystal employed devices indicate weaker VOC dependence on light intensity than amorphous rubrene-based solar cells. These crystal forms might reduce the density of interfacial defects between donor and acceptor layers resulting in charge carriers escaping deep traps and decreasing trap-assisted recombination in comparison with the amorphous layer. The value of 1.56 kT/q of the single crystal solar cell device demonstrated likely low SRH recombination involved in comparison with the amorphous/polymorphous counterpart, which could be resulting from rather low trap assisted behaviour at the interface. This situation gives rise to less VOC loss caused from non-radiative recombination.35 It is confirmed that the low VOC of the single crystal device results from small energy level splitting instead of bigger non radiative recombination loss due to the rubrene single crystals having almost no defects providing a long exciton diffusion length.34 To improve our understanding about charge recombination kinetics, we need to investigate the dependence of FF and JSC on light intensity. The JSC value implies charge carrier collection and transport between the absorber layer and electrodes.45,46 In Fig. 4d, from the slope of the JSCversus light intensity graph in log–log scale, we extracted the linearity values for the single crystal and different formed solar cell devices (amorphous, triclinic, and orthorhombic). For the single crystal solar cell, the linearity yield α = 0.93 and α decreases to 0.92, 0.81 and 0.82 for the devices with orthorhombic, triclinic, and amorphous, respectively. These values exhibit the monomolecular (trap assisted) recombination at short circuit conditions but the deep understanding and analysis of JSC variations requires both electrical and optical characterization, whereas we concentrated on electrical characterizations. That is why we interpretated the dependency of FF to understand the performance limiting mechanism in the solar cell devices. The FF as a function of light can inform about defect states at the bulk and interfaces.47Fig. 4e shows the FF versus light intensity graphs of the devices. The FF values of the single crystal device did not change with light intensity where trap assisted recombination is nearly not present. For amorphous rubrene based devices, the FF behaviour represents the intermediate bulk recombination or medium interface recombination, meaning that trap assisted recombination is dominant for this type of solar cell. Orthorhombic and triclinic forms of rubrene employed devices exhibit te strong FF dependency under different intensities that can be explained by the high interface defect densities.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, organic single crystals with different crystal thickness from 250 nm to 1000 nm were used to fabricate inverted bilayer heterojunction solar cells of rubrene single crystals and PCBM films. The best photovoltaic performance is achieved with 250 nm thick rubrene crystal and it shows PCE of 0.1% with a short-circuit current density of 0.30 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 0.60 V, and a fill factor of 0.57. Although the efficiency of the single crystal solar cell is not comparable with thin film devices, these results could be useful for further optoelectronic applications. To our knowledge this is the first time that vertical single crystal solar cells with different rubrene thicknesses (fabricated by PVT) have been reported. To compare the crystallinity effect on photovoltaic device performance, we fabricated polycrystalline triclinic orthorhombic, and amorphous bilayer devices, which have the same thickness of the donor layer as the single crystal devices. The open circuit voltage of the devices shows a decreasing trend from amorphous, to triclinic, orthorhombic and single crystal. The short circuit current of the devices exhibits a tendency to increase from amorphous, to triclinic and orthorhombic forms of rubrene-based solar cells. According to our results, the triclinic form of rubrene shows the highest PCE in this device concept. To deeply verify the reason for the device parameters changing upon crystalline and ordered surfaces, detailed light intensity measurements have been realized. The single crystal device shows largely bimolecular recombination but the amorphous and polycrystalline rubrene based devices show approximately %30 higher additional monomolecular recombination, which is dominated by trap states. Although the single crystal devices show a relatively trap free donor layer and better FF, they still exhibit lower PCE than the evaporated rubrene thin film devices because of higher transparency of thin Rubrene crystals.
