    , Accepted 21st September 2018First published on 11th October 2018AbstractHerein, we report three new metal-free organic polymer sensitizers with the pyridine (PYN) π-bridge, having the structure (donor)2–π–acceptor ((D2)–π–A). They were labelled as PPNPP, FPNPP, and APNPP due to the presence of a molecular framework, and used as photosensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). Phenothiazine, fluorene and anthracene serve as the electron donor groups, nitrobenzene serves as the electron acceptor group, and pyridine serves as the π-bridge group. The detailed investigation of the relationship between the structure, thermal properties, electrochemical properties, and performance of DSSC is described herein. Furthermore, DFT studies were performed using the Gaussian 09 program with the B3LYP functional and 6-31G* basis set to evaluate their optimized geometry and HOMO–LUMO levels. The introduction of these three different donor units can drastically improve the sunlight-harvesting ability of DSSCs and the electron recombination, thus improving their performance. The polymer PPNPP shows a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE, h) of 2.1%, which was achieved for the photovoltaic devices under AM 1.5 solar radiation (100 mW cm−2). With the addition of 10 mM CDCA as a co-adsorbent, the best performing cells based on the polymer dye PPNPP exhibit an impressive conversion efficiency of 4.12% (Jsc = 7.23 mA cm2, Voc = 0.76 V, FF = 69%).
1. Introduction
Every year, the demand for energy increases due to the depletion of fossil fuels. This has led to the motivation of the scientific community to introduce environmentally benign alternative energy conversion systems based on renewable energy sources.1,2 One of these promising alternative energy conversion systems are solar cells and considerable attention has been paid towards research on photoactive organic materials to convert photons from sunlight to electrical energy.3 Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), the most efficient devices to convert sunlight to electricity, have attracted researchers due to their low production cost, easy material synthesis process, low hazard risk, environmental friendliness, lightweight, flexible physical structure, high power conversion efficiency (PCE), and renewability since the first report about DSSCs in 1991 by Gratzel et al.4,5 In general, dye sensitizers can be devoted to designing and synthesizing sensitizers for DSSCs, into metal-containing organic dyes and metal-free organic dyes.6
The most important metal dyes such as zinc porphyrin complexes with cobalt electrolyte conversion efficiencies of over 13% have been achieved; similarly, ruthenium polypyridine complexes are extremely good in terms of power conversion efficiency.7–12 However, the main drawback of these metal complex dyes is the tedious synthesis protocol, difficulty in purification, complication leading to low yields, high metal cost, rarity of noble metals, and bad environmental effects.13–15 Therefore, metal-free organic dyes, which have remarkable light to current conversion efficiencies,16 are preferred in place of organic dyes containing metals. Metal-free organic dyes have been widely studied in recent years because of their advantages including low cost of preparation, easy synthesis, easily tunable properties, good flexibility in molecular tailoring, high molar extinction coefficient, tunable photophysical spectral behavior and excellent light-harvesting properties (control of the HOMO–LUMO energy levels), indicating their bright future in commercial usage.17–19
Generally, metal-free organic dyes are designed for donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) configuration to link the electron-rich donor and electron-deficient acceptor anchor groups linked with a π-spacer to enhance the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process in effective sunlight harvesting.20 The D–π–A organic dyes, all of the donor, acceptor and π-linker parts can be modified. This structural alteration plays an important role in altering the photon-to-electron conversion.21,22 This structural modification leads to a change in photophysical, thermal, electrochemical and photovoltaic performance. The D–π–A-type metal-free sensitizer has been used in different types of donating groups, which include phenothiazine, triphenylamine, coumarin, cyanine, thiophene, merocyanine, phenoxazine, carbazole and julolidine.23–26 The electron-withdrawing units reported in the literature reveals that cyanoacetic acid and rhodanine-3-acetic acid bind with TiO2, thus resulting in high photovoltaic performance in DSSCs.27,28 At present, the incorporation of more donor and acceptor segments into D–π–A type organic dyes changes the molecular configuration form of D–D–π–A, D–A–π–A and A–π–D–π–A.29–31
As reported by Yang et al. (2007), phenothiazine (PTZ)-based organic dye T2-1 achieved the power conversion efficiency (η) of 5.5%.32 Selvam et al. also improved the power conversion efficiency (5.91%) of the polymer organic dyes by extending the PTZ donor groups.33 Hence, increasing the number of electron donor groups improves the absorption, electrochemical properties as well as the photon-to-electron conversion performances of DSSCs.34 The power conversion efficiency can be improved by introducing different donor units in the organic dyes.
In this study, we have designed and synthesized three new poly(methacrylate)-based (D2)–π–A-type metal-free polymer sensitizers (PPNPP, FPNPP and APNPP) by employing phenothiazine (PPNPP), fluorene (FPNPP) and anthracene (APNPP) as the donor units, respectively (Scheme 1). As an anchoring unit to the surface of TiO2, the 3-nitrobenzene group was employed, and pyridine was introduced as a π-conjugation for the electron transfer to donor and acceptor (Fig. 1). The influence of the different strengths in dual donor frameworks reflected in the photophysical, thermal, electrochemical properties and the photovoltaic performance of the polymer sensitizers (PPNPP, FPNPP and APNPP). DSSCs fabricated with PPNPP, FPNPP and APNPP showed power conversion efficiencies (PCE, h) of 2.18, 1.02 and 0.85% respectively. This result reveals that the PPNPP polymer produces high PCE owing to the phenothiazine-pyridine-3-nitrobenzene (D2)–π–A framework. The synthesis of monomers and polymers was achieved by a few-step process with good yield. Moreover, co-absorbents such as CDCA (chenodeoxycholic acid), DPA (1-decyl phosphonic acid), DCA (deoxycholic acid), and HDMA (hexadecylmalonic acid) were also used in the dye solution when the TiO2 photoanode was incorporated into DSSCs.35–38 Therefore, in this study, we aimed to establish and understand the importance of chenodeoxycholic acid in the enhancement of DSSCs performance parameters, the influence of CDCA on the three polymer dyes (PPNPP, FPNPP and APNPP), and also the intramolecular electron transfer and electron lifetime in solar cell devices.22,39–41

2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
The synthesis routes to PPNPP, FPNPP and APNPP are shown in Scheme 1, and the preparation methods and characterization of intermediates, monomers and polymers are provided in the ESI.† All required reagents were purchased from commercial merchants and used as received unless otherwise indicated. The column chromatographic separations were performed using silica gel (60–120 mesh; analytical grade). Fluorene-doped SnO2 (FTO) conducting glass was cleaned with a detergent solution, double distilled water and acetone under ultrasonication.
2.2 Compound characterization and methods

1H- and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Avance 500 MHz spectrometer with DMSO-d6 or CDCl3 as solvents. FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu FT-IR 8400 spectrometer using KBr pellets. UV-vis spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-1650PC spectrometer using dimethylformamide (DMF) as the solvent. Elemental analysis was performed with a Perkin-Elmer C–H analyzer. The differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) curves were recorded on a Mettler TA-3000 under purge gas at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The decomposition temperatures (Td) of the polymers were determined with a Mettler 851e Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) device under nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Molecular weights (Mw), polydispersity index (PDI) and average molecular weights (Mn) were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with polystyrene as the standard used for calibration and tetrahydrofuran as the eluent. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was performed on a JEOL GCMATE II GC-MS to record the mass spectra. All reactions were monitored using TLC (thin layer chromatography) plates. Melting points of all the as-synthesized intermediate and monomer compounds were determined using an open capillary tube method.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on an AUTOLAB PGSTAT302N electrochemical workstation in a typical three-electrode electrochemical system driven by the NOVA software package. A glassy carbon (GC) working electrode, an Ag/Ag+ reference electrode (which was calibrated with ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as the external reference) and a platinum counter electrode were used. The supporting electrolyte used was 0.1 M TBAP (tetrabutylammonium perchlorate) in acetonitrile solution, and the scan rate was 100 mV s−1.
2.3 Preparation of TiO2/polymeric–dye hybrid films and device assembly
The FTO glass plates were immersed for 30 min in titanium tetrachloride solution at 70 °C and washed. A commercially-available titanium oxide nanoparticle (8 μm thick film of 20 nm sized) paste was coated onto the FTO glass by the doctor blade technique and subsequently sintered at 500 °C for 15 min. Then, the coated glass was gradually heated, as described earlier in this paper, to prepare a mesoporous TiO2 layer.42,43 After the FTO glass plates were immersed in a titanium tetrachloride solution at 70 °C for 30 min, the substrates were sintered at 500 °C for 15 min. The dye-loaded electrodes (without CDCA) were prepared by immersing titanium oxide into around 0.15 mM dye solution (solvent: t-butylalcohol/acetonitrile = 1:1 (v/v)) and kept in dark conditions at 25 °C for 24 h (5 mm area, respectively). The dye-loaded electrodes (with CDCA) were prepared by immersing titanium oxide into around 0.15 mM dye solution with 10 mM chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), and were kept at 25 °C in the dark for the same time (5 mm area, respectively). The Pt-sputtered FTO glass plates were used as counter electrodes. The cell assembled in a sandwich type into the electrode and the counter electrode. The electrolyte solution comprising 0.05 M iodine (I2), 0.5 M LiI, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in 3-methoxypropionitrile was used as the liquid electrolyte injected in between the two electrodes. After combining the dye-sensitized photoanode and platinized counter electrode, the iodide electrolyte was injected in between the two electrodes. Then, the cell was sealed with a Surlyn sheet and thin cover glass by heating.
2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurements
The photovoltaic characterization parameters (such as open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF)) and short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of the solar cells were measured in air using a Keithley 4200 semiconductor characterization system (solar AAA simulator, Oriel China, calibrated with a standard crystalline silicon solar) and an Oriel white light solar simulator working at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 under AM 1.5G condition. The IPCE for the photovoltaic cells was obtained using an Oriel 300 W Xe arc lamp in combination with an Oriel Cornerstone 2601/4 monochromator. The monochromator was incremented through the visible spectrum to create the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency spectra. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) in the dark and under illumination were recorded using an electrochemical workstation (AUTOLAB PGSTAT302N) with a frequency response analyzer. A frequency range from 0.1 Hz and 10 kHz was applied at the open circuit potential (OCP).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and characterization of polymers
The synthesis route of the monomers and the polymer sensitizers is depicted in Scheme 1. The synthesis of the three target polymer dye sensitizers started from 4-hydroxy-3-nitrobenzaldehyde, which was converted to compounds PPNP, FPNP and APNP by the Hantzsch Pyridine synthesis with 2-acetyl phenothiazine, 2-acetylfluorene and 2-acetylanthracene, respectively. Esterification of the compounds PPNP, FPNP and APNP was performed using methacryloyl chloride to yield the monomers PPNPM, FPNPM and APNPM. Finally, the desired polymer sensitizers PPNPP, FPNPP and APNPP were synthesized using 2,2′-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as an initiator by the free radical polymerization reaction. The detailed synthesis procedures and characteristic data for all the compounds and polymers are provided in the ESI.†
The molecular weight (Mw) and thermal properties of PPNPP, FPNPP and APNPP are summarized in Table 1. The weight average molecular weight (Mw), number average molecular weights (Mn), and polydispersity index (PDI) were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using polystyrene standards. The polydispersity index values of PPNPP, FPNPP and APNPP were found to be 1.61, 1.50 and 1.53, respectively, which are typical in the case of free-radical polymerization. The melting point values of the intermediate and the monomer compounds PPNP, FPNP, APNP, PPNPM, FPNPM and APNPM were found to be 152 °C, 125 °C, 131 °C, 206 °C, 195 °C and 187 °C, respectively. Thermal analysis of the polymers was performed by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to determine the glass transition temperature (Tg) from the change in heat capacity (ΔCp) in the DSC thermograms (see Fig. S2, ESI†). The Tg values of the polymers PPNPP, FPNPP and APNPP were found to be 152 °C, 136 °C and 128 °C, respectively. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the three polymers PPNPP, FPNPP and APNPP revealed their values to be 302 °C, 280 °C and 265 °C, respectively under nitrogen, see Fig. S1 (ESI†). The new polymers PPNPP, FPNPP and APNPP showed good thermal stabilities for applications in DSSCs and other optoelectronic devices.

3.2 UV-vis absorption spectra
The UV-vis absorption spectra of PPNPP, FPNPP and APNPP in DMF solution are shown in Fig. 2a and the corresponding optical data are listed in Table 2. The absorption bands were observed at 360, 346 and 342 nm for the PPNPP, FPNPP and APNPP polymers, respectively. The PPNPP polymer showed a maximum absorption peak at 360 nm, attributed to the more-localized π–π* transitions. All the polymer peaks corresponding to the longer wavelength can be attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the donor moieties to the 3-nitrobenzene group anchoring group. All the polymer dyes exhibit two absorption bands at around 350 nm and 430 nm. The weak absorption peak band in the ultraviolet region corresponds to the π → π* electronic transitions and the strong absorption peak that lies in the visible region is assigned to an ICT between the donor group and the acceptor end unit.44–49 The bands at around 360 nm for the case of the PPNPP polymer arise because of the slightly stronger electron-donating character of the phenothiazine donor (D2) unit containing the nitrobenzene acceptor with the π-bridge linker in the pyridine group. Phenothiazine is a strong electron donor unit when compared with fluorene and anthracene donor units. With the increase in the absorption band, red-shifts occur, and the peaks are found to be shifted to 342 (APNPP), 346 (FPNPP) and 360 nm (PPNPP). In addition, the molar extinction coefficient (ε) changes due to the introduction of different donor groups in the polymer chain.50 The HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) and LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) band gaps (Eg) determined from the onset of the optical absorption are 2.78, 2.92 and 3.08 eV for PPNPP, FPNPP and APNPP, respectively, which are summarized in Table 2 and shown in Fig. 5a and b.

Interaction with the TiO2 surface. 
The absorption spectra of the polymer dyes adsorbed on the TiO2 film are shown in Fig. 2b. The maximum absorption peaks for PPNPP, FPNPP and APNPP are at 358, 342 and 334 nm, respectively. The electron-withdrawing units of 3-nitrobenzene bind onto the TiO2 film surface. On the TiO2 surface, the blue shifts vary considerably in the following manner: 8 nm (PPNPP), 4 nm (FPNPP) and 8 nm (APNPP). The blue shift occurred due to the formation of H-aggregation or the deprotonation of the 3-nitrobenzene on the TiO2 surface.51–53

3.3 Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of the as-synthesized polymers were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) method. The relevant data are listed in Table 2. The recorded cyclic voltammetry and the energy levels of the polymers are provided in Fig. 3. The oxidation potentials of the polymer dyes were measured in acetonitrile solution containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAHFP) as the electrolyte, and a ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) couple was used as the internal standard. The oxidation potentials (Eox) of the polymers PPNPP, FPNPP and APNPP are 0.69, 0.59 and 0.43 V, respectively. These oxidation potentials (Eox) values in comparison with that of the I−/I3− redox couple electrolyte (0.45 V vs. NHE).54,55 suggest that the as-synthesized polymer dyes can provide a driving force for the ground state regeneration of dyes. As per the observation, the oxidation potential (Eox) increased in the respective order APNPP < FPNPP < PPNPP. The PPNPP polymer has the most positive potential as phenothiazine is a better electron donor (the order of donor strength is phenothiazine > fluorene > anthracene, based on DFT results, which are given in Fig. 4). The HOMO energy values obtained from the oxidation potential values are found to be −5.17, −7.07 and −4.91 eV for PPNPP, FPNPP and APNPP, respectively. Moreover, the LUMO energy levels of PPNPP, FPNPP and APNPP were found to be −2.39, −2.17 and −2.09 eV, respectively. These values indicated that these polymers possess good driving forces for the electron injection from the polymer sensitizers into the CB of TiO2. The electrochemical band gap (Eg) values of PPNPP, FPNPP and APNPP were 2.78, 2.92 and 3.08 eV, respectively. The Eg values of the polymer dyes that play an important role in DSSCs are shown in Fig. 5a and b.56,57

3.4 Theoretical molecular orbital calculations
The molecular structure and electron distribution are investigated for the three monomer dyes. The monomers have been optimized using DFT calculations with the Gaussian 09 program with the B3LYP functional and 6-31G* basis set.42,58Fig. 4 shows the optimized molecular structure and frontier molecular orbitals (HOMO and LUMO) of the dimers for PPNPM, FPNM and APNPM with corresponding repeat units. The optimized configurations show that each monomer possesses a propeller-like structure because of the donor moieties attached to the pyridine π-linker, which reduces the aggregation of monomer structure on the TiO2 surface.59 The charge distributions on the HOMO (localized on phenothiazine, fluorene and anthracene units) and the LUMO (located on the acceptor 3-nitrobenzene fragment of the monomers) are clearly indicated by the optimized geometry of the dyes. The spatial separation in the HOMO and LUMO orbitals passes through the π-bridge of the (D2)–π–A organic dyes that are important in DSSCs. The electron redistribution between the HOMO and LUMO orbitals and the overlaps between the donor and acceptor groups indicated that the intramolecular electron transition favors the electron injection into the CB of TiO2.60,61 However, in the phenothiazine-based monomer (PPNPM), the HOMO and LUMO energy levels is high in comparison with the other donors (FPNPM and APNPM). In addition, the presence of the anchoring 3-nitrobenzene group enhances the charge transfer between phenothiazine and the 3-nitrobenzene group.
3.5 Photoelectrochemical properties
The as-synthesized polymer sensitizers (PPNPP, FPNPP and APNPP) were optimized in DSSCs as photosensitizers to investigate the photovoltaic performance parameters under AM 1.5 sunlight (100 mW cm−2). The detailed photovoltaic parameters in terms of short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (η) for each DSSC are summarized in Table 3. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves and the corresponding data are shown in Fig. 6 and 7 (without CDCA and with 10 mM CDCA). In the DSSC device, the Jsc, Voc and FF values of the polymers PPNPP, FPNPP and APNPP decreased in that order as shown in Table 3. The introduction of different donor groups (phenothiazine, fluorene, and anthracene), a polymeric structure in the π-bridge (pyridine) and acceptor (3-nitrobenzene) units leads to a prominent decrease in the power conversion efficiency (PPNPP > FPNPP > APNPP) in DSSC. In summary, the PPNPP polymer cell showed a high power conversion efficiency when compared with the other two polymer dyes and showed a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 5.73 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.68 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.68, corresponding to a power conversion efficiency (η) of 3.97%. Alternatively, the FPNPP-sensitized DSSC exhibited an overall η = 1.02% with cell parameters of Jsc = 7.79 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.72 V, and FF = 0.61. The DSSC-based on the APNPP sensitizer achieved Jsc = 10.21 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.85 V, and FF = 0.74, corresponding to an overall η = 0.85%. Finally, the polymer PPNPP showed higher solar efficiency and better light-harvesting ability than all the other polymers.

Furthermore, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of PPNPP, FPNPP and APNPP polymer dye-fabricated DSSCs are shown in Fig. 8 and 9 (without and with 10 mM chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA)), and their corresponding data were listed in Table 3. Generally, higher IPCE action spectra correspond to better Jsc.62 The light-harvesting ability and electron injection efficiency depend on the Jsc value.44,63 The phenothiazine segment-containing polymer PPNPP-based devices show better IPCE values compared with polymers with fluorene (FPNPP) and anthracene (APNPP) segment-based devices. The IPCE value of DSSCs based on PPNPP reached a maximum value of about 28.5% at 422 nm, while that of devices based on FPNPP reached about 27.3% at 407 nm, and that of devices based on APNPP reached about 25.2% at 400 nm. These results indicate that the PPNPP polymer dye with the phenothiazine donor (D2) group is a better alternative to the metal-containing organic dye used in DSSCs.

Table 3 and Fig. 6, 7 show the J–V data for the devices prepared using the polymer dyes without and with 10 mM chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). According to the data, working DSSC devices are produced by all variables with comparable performance from polymer dyes with and without CDCA. Co-adsorption with CDCA was also performed to prevent aggregation of the polymer dyes on TiO2. With the use of CDCA as a co-adsorbent, the solar cell performance was improved. However, adding the co-adsorbent CDCA has a profound influence on the DSSCs efficiencies of the three polymer dyes, improving the power conversion efficiency by 2-fold to 4.12%, 2.07% and 1.53% for PPNPP, FPNPP and APNPP, respectively (without the CDCA polymer: PPNPP (η, 2.18%), FPNPP (η, 1.02%) and APNPP (η, 0.85%)).64 The co-adsorption of CDCA decreased the dye loading amount of the polymer dyes significantly by reducing dye aggregation. At the same time, the PCE was also improved.40,41,64
Upon comparing the power conversion efficiency of CDCA with polymer dyes, it was found that DSSCs device possess better efficiency than those without the CDCA polymer dyes.65–67 This may lead to an increase in Voc and Jsc values (for the polymer PPNPP, the Voc value increased from 0.71 to 0.76 V and the Jsc value increased from 4.35 to 7.23 mA cm−2; for the polymer FPNPP, the Voc value increased from 0.62 to 0.64 V, and the Jsc value increased from 2.52 to 4.00 mA cm−2; and for polymer APNPP, the Voc value increased from 0.58 to 0.60 V and the Jsc value increased from 2.18 to 2.81 mA cm−2). The highest power conversion efficiency was obtained at 10 mM CDCA, in polymer PPNPP, achieving an overall conversion efficiency of 4.12% (Jsc = 7.2 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.76 V, FF = 69%). These changes support previous reports suggesting that co-adsorption (CDCA) improves the balance of electron injection over recombination by shifting the conduction band position.68,69 However, CDCA suppresses dye aggregation,35,70,71 which also improves DSSCs device efficiencies. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency of PPNPP, FPNPP and APNPP polymer dyes has a better result with 10 mM CDCA than without CDCA (Fig. 9 and Table 3).72
A new series of four metal-free organic polymer sensitizers (In-In-BzI)PMA, (Ac-In-BzI)PMA, (TPA-In-BzI)PMA, and (Py-In-BzI)PMA were already reported.73 In these polymers, the donor–acceptor units were linked by an indole–chalcone conjugated π-bridge. However, in the present study, the donor–acceptor units were linked by a pyridine π-bridge. This pyridine π-bridge linkage results in an increase in electron transfer from donor to acceptor of the polymer PPNPP (PCE, 2.18%) in comparison with previously studied polymers (In-In-BzI) PMA (PCE, 1.95%) and (Py-In-BzI)PMA (PCE, 1.54%). By introducing the pyridine π-bridge unit in the middle of the as-synthesized polymers (PPNPP, FPNPP and APNPP), the photo-current density (Jsc) as well as overall current conversion efficiency (η) increased. These may occur due to the intramolecular charge transfer effects of pyridine and donor–acceptor groups.
3.6 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of DSSCs
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to investigate the charge recombination of DSSCs and to elucidate the relationship between the photovoltage and the effect of molecular modification in the as-synthesized polymers. The typical Nyquist and Bode plots obtained using DSSCs made with the PPNPP, FPNPP and APNPP dyes are shown in Fig. 10a and b. The kinetics of charge transfer processes in DSSCs device fabricated with the TiO2/polymer/electrolyte interface results were determined from electrochemical impedance spectra.73 The charge recombination resistance (Rrec) was measured by interfacial charge recombination reaction of electrons with I3− ions (electrolyte). The Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 8a. The larger semicircle in the Nyquist plots is attributed to the charge transfer resistance at the TiO2 electrode/dye/electrolyte interface. A larger charge transfer resistance value indicated slower electron recombination and decreased dark current, thus resulting in a higher open circuit voltage (Voc).73,74 The large semicircles increase in the order APNPP < FPNPP < PPNPP, indicating that Rrec also increases accordingly. The Rrec of the polymer PPNPP is higher than those of the polymers FPNPP and APNPP, which is consistent with the result of Voc.
 Fig. 10  (a) Nyquist and (b) Bode plots obtained from the DSSCs based on the polymer (PPNPP, FPNPP and APNPP) sensitizers in the dark. 
The Bode plots for PPNPP, FPNPP and APNPP are shown in Fig. 10b. The electron recombination lifetime (s) values were calculated from the Bode phase plots. The electron lifetime observed from the peak position of the middle frequency was related to the charge recombination rate at the TiO2/polymer sensitizer/electrolyte interface.75 In general, the high open-circuit voltage of the device depends on the longer electron lifetime (lower dark current).76 The electron recombination lifetime values for the polymers increase in the order APNPP < FPNPP < PPNPP, which depends on the observed Voc. This result indicates that the polymer PPNPP has the longest lifetime. From DSSC, the PPNPP (with double phenothiazine units) polymer shows the longest electron lifetime. This is because of the back reaction of the injected electron in a TiO2 band with the electrolyte. The EIS results indicate that the polymer PPNPP possesses improved Voc and better solar cell performance with phenothiazine donor units, and pyridine is a π-linker group in the modified (D2)–π–A polymer sensitizers.
4. Conclusion
In the present research study, three polymers (PPNPP, FPNPP and APNPP) have been synthesized, and these polymers possess number average molecular weights in the range of 28900–30200. The influence of different donor moieties in the backbone on the energy level of the polymer compounds and their photovoltaic characteristics were studied. It was observed that a PPNPP cell, which has phenothiazine as the backbone, displays a power conversion efficiency of 2.18%. Co-adsorption of CDCA improved the photoelectrochemical properties and reduced the dye loading. The present research study confirms that the incorporation of pyridine as a π-conjugated core into the dye backbone is a promising method to construct highly efficient (D2)–π–A metal-free polymer dye-sensitized solar cells.
