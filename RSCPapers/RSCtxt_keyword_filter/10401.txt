    , Accepted 26th April 2017First published on 26th April 2017AbstractIn recent years, cathode interfacial layers (CILs), as versatile functional layers, have been extensively investigated for use in organic electronics. Many excellent CILs have been designed and prepared, and these have provided a distinct improvement in device performance. In this study, two bathophenanthroline-based cationic CILs (Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr) were synthesized via a simple intramolecular cyclization reaction with 1,2-dibromoethane and 1,3-dibromopropane, respectively, for use in polymer solar cells (PSCs), and their chemical, thermal, photophysical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties were characterized. Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr exhibited high thermal stability, and their glass transition temperatures exceeded 100 °C. Additionally, Bphen-Et has a glass transition temperature above 181 °C. The electrochemical characterization shows that Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr have very deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, where the HOMOs and LUMOs of Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr are −6.63 and −6.67 and −4.16 and −4.18 eV, respectively. These very low HOMOs and LUMOs enhance the photovoltaic performance and decrease interfacial energy loss. The PSCs based on the poly[4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithio-phene-2,6-diyl-alt-ethylhexyl-3-fluorothithieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate-4,6-diyl] (PTB7): [6,6]-phenyl-C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) system with Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr CILs exhibit simultaneous enhancement in open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current density, and fill factor, and their power conversion efficiency increases from 3.98% to 8.05%, relative to that of the bare Al device. This type of cationic aromatic compound shows promise as a candidate CIL for use in PSCs.
Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells (BHJ PSCs), which are a type of versatile solar-energy-converting-electricity technology, are becoming increasingly attractive academically and commercially because of their excellent merits of low cost, lightweight, and large-scale fabrication.1,2 To date, many improvements have been made in the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. It is well known that power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) can exceed 12% in fullerene-based or in all-polymer PSCs.3,4 These fantastic PSC achievements make them potentially applicable in the general market.
The PSC device architecture is a sandwich structure and includes an anode, a cathode, and an active layer. The development of polymer donors for active layers has received significant attention.5 Many high-efficacy polymers have been designed and produced: poly[N-9′′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT),6 poly[4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithio-phene-2,6-diyl-alt-ethylhexyl-3-fluorothithieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate-4,6-diyl] (PTB7),7 poly[[2,6′-4,8-di(5-ethylhexylthienyl)benzo[1,2-b;3,3-b]dithiophene][3-fluoro-2[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7-Th)8 and poly[(5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazol-4,7-diyl)-alt-(3,3′′′-di(2-nonyltridecyl)-2,2′;5′,2′′;5′′,2′′′-quaterthiophen-5,5′′′-diyl)] (PffBT4T-C9C13).9 On the other hand, versatile aromatic organic acceptors have also been developed, which have been used to merge all-polymer PSCs.10 Due to the development of these organic acceptors, the photovoltaic properties and device stability have been significantly improved.11–13 These achievements in active layers definitely advanced the photovoltaic performance of PSCs; however, interface engineering in PSCs is also important in fullerene-based and all-polymer PSCs to achieve high efficiencies.14 Anode/active layer and cathode/active layer interfaces are most significant in interface engineering for PSCs. To form good interfacial contact, additional anode and cathode interfacial layers are essentially inserted between the cathode/anode and active layers. Conducting polymer composites (PEDOT:PSS) are used extensively for anode interfacial layers (AILs) because of their excellent properties.15 Significantly, there has been much focus on the development of new cathode interfacial layers (CILs) for PSCs. The insertion of CILs may form a protective layer to prevent Al from diffusing into the active layer and quenching excitons, thus decreasing the interfacial energy loss. CILs could decrease the work functions (WFs) of cathodes to facilitate electron transport from the active layer to the cathode and reduce the interfacial energy barrier. CILs may also form a built-in potential (Vbi) for PSC devices, where the open circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) may be enhanced significantly.16–18
In recent years, some inorganic materials, such as LiF19,20 and metal oxides (TiOx and ZnOx),21–23 or organic materials, such as insulating poly(ethylene oxide)24 and water/alcohol soluble conjugated polymers (WSCPs),25–27 have been used widely as CILs. Among these materials, inorganic CILs display relatively poor interfacial contacts with organic active layers due to the intrinsic incompatibilities between inorganic and organic materials, which may result in relatively poor electron extraction efficiency. Furthermore, inorganic materials may exhibit poor film-forming ability above the organic active layers. Organic CILs (small molecules and polymers), especially those that contain WSCPs, have received considerable attention due to their distinct advantages, including simple processability, chemical diversity and physical flexibility.28,29 Versatile polyfluorene (PF) derivatives as CILs, which are soluble in water or alcohol, have been developed and have resulted in many advances in PSCs.30,31 Interestingly, these WSCPs have chemical structures with anchoring polar groups in their polymer side chains or the polar groups are located in their conjugated backbones. The introduction of polar groups may yield interfacial dipoles and n-doping between the active layers and cathodes, which could improve the photovoltaic performance.32
Compared to polymers, small molecules have specific merits such as high purity, feasible reproduction and high yields. Many water/alcohol-soluble small molecules that function as CILs in PSCs have been developed.33–36 Bathophenanthroline (Bphen) and its derivatives as versatile electron transport layers are used widely in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and perovskite solar cells (PVSCs).37,38 For instance, Zhu et al. synthesized a triarylphosphine oxide-anchored phenanthroline derivative (Phen-NaDPO), which showed high solubility in methanol and isopropanol and displayed an excellent photovoltaic performance as a CIL in PSCs.39 However, these small molecules exhibit high lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, which may mismatch the LUMOs of fullerene acceptors.40 Ideally, the deep LUMO energy levels (approximately −4.0 eV) of CILs benefit electron-carrier transport from the active layers to the cathode.41,42
Herein, we synthesize two Bphen-based cationic derivatives (Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr) via intramolecular cyclization with 1,2-dibromoethane and 1,3-dibromopropane, respectively. Due to the formation of nitrogen cations in the Bphen backbone, the LUMOs of Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr decrease to approximately −4.10 eV, which approaches the LUMOs of fullerene acceptors in PSCs. The HOMOs of Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr decrease to approximately −6.60 eV, which is much deeper than either polymer donors (approximately −5.40 eV) or fullerene acceptors (approximately −6.0 eV). These deep HOMOs of Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr CILs could work as efficient hole-carrier blocks and decrease the energy losses in the cathode interface. Through photovoltaic characterization using PTB7 as a donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as an acceptor, the PCEs are improved significantly (∼8.0%) compared to the bare Al-based devices. Hence, this type of cationic material may be excellent candidates as CILs in PSCs.

Characterization

1H NMR and 13C NMR measurements were carried out on a Varian Mercury plus 400 M spectrometer operating at 400 MHz (for 1H) and 100 MHz (for 13C) with d-dimethyl sulfoxide as the solvent and tetramethylsilane as the internal reference. Elemental analyses were performed on a Vario EL elemental analysis instrument. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted using a NETZSCH TG 209 at 10 °C min−1 and a nitrogen flow rate of 20 mL min−1. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was conducted on a Netzsch DSC 204 under an N2 flow at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 and cooling rate of 20 °C min−1. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra were obtained using an HP 8453 spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted using a CHI600D electrochemical workstation with a standard three-electrode cell based on a Pt wire counter electrode and a Pt working electrode, against a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode at 50 mV s−1 in a nitrogen-saturated anhydrous solution of 0.1 mol L−1 tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in acetonitrile versus ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as the internal reference. Photoelectron yield spectroscopy (PYS) was measured with atmospheric ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (Rikken Keiki AC-3).
Fabrication of polymer solar cells
Patterned indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates were used as the anode in the PSC devices. The substrates were cleaned sequentially in detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol with sonication and dried in a nitrogen stream, followed by oxygen plasma treatment. A 40 nm layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy thiophene):poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) (Baytron PVPAI 4083) was applied by spin-coating to modify the ITO substrate surface, followed by baking at 200 °C for 10 min to remove the residual water. The substrates were placed in a nitrogen-filled glove box and an 80–100 nm blended active layer of PTB7:PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w) was deposited on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer by spin-casting it from a solution of chlorobenzene and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO, 3 v%). Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr CILs (5–10 nm) were spin-coated from 4 and 1.5 mg mL−1 solutions in MeOH at 2000 rpm for 30 s, respectively. Finally, an 80 nm layer of aluminum was deposited thermally as the cathode through a shadow mask (defined active area of 0.16 cm2) in a chamber.
The Al cathode thickness was monitored upon deposition using a crystal thickness monitor (Sycon). The thickness of the organic film was determined by profilometry (Veeco Dektak150). Device fabrication was completed in a nitrogen atmosphere dry-box (Vacuum Atmosphere Co.). The J–V characteristics of the device were measured with a Keithley 236 source meter. Its spectral response was recorded with a commercial photomodulation spectroscopic setup (Oriel Instruments). A calibrated Si photodiode was used to determine photosensitivity. PCE was measured using an AM 1.5G solar simulator (Oriel model 91192). The power of the sun simulation was calibrated before testing using a standard silicon solar cell.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
The target water/alcohol-soluble small molecules (Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr) were synthesized via a simple intramolecular cyclization reaction with 1,2-dibromoethane and 1,3-dibromopropane, respectively, and the synthetic route is presented in Scheme 1. Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr were obtained with high yields of 90% and 93%, respectively. These two small molecules are highly soluble in water, methanol and ethanol, but do not dissolve in dichloromethane and low-polar solvents. We also prepared another analogue by reacting phenanthroline with 1,2-dibromoethane. This compound has very high solubility in water, but is insoluble in other common polar solvents, such as methanol and ethanol. It is possible that the hydrophobic phenyl groups in bathophenanthroline for Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr improve their solubility in alcohol solvents. Compared with pristine bathophenanthroline, Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr have higher solubility in alcohol solvents because of the formation of cationic compounds.

Thermal properties
Thermal properties are used to evaluate organic semiconductor quality. Thus, TGA and DSC were used to evaluate the thermal properties of Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr. The TGA and DCS curves are shown in Fig. 1 and the relative data are summarized in Table 1. Fig. 1a shows that the degradation temperatures at 5% weight loss (Td) are 321 °C and 252 °C for Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr, respectively. Fig. 1b shows the glass transition temperatures (Tg) of 181 °C and 108 °C for Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr, respectively. On the basis of the thermal properties, it is noted that Bphen-Et exhibits much higher thermal stability than Bphen-Pr. This is possibly because the hexatomic ring in Bphen-Et has higher structural and thermal stability than the heptatomic ring in Bphen-Pr. The heptatomic ring has much higher intramolecular tension than the hexatomic ring in the organic molecules. Therefore, it may be easier to open and destroy the heptatomic rings, especially under thermal treatment. From the TG curves, Bphen-Pr shows a sharp mass loss at 252 °C. From calculations, this mass loss at 252 °C is ∼31%, which approximates to the mass ratio (∼37%) of 1,3-dibromopropane in Bphen-Pr.

Optical and electrochemical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr in dilute ethanol solution and in film are shown in Fig. 2a and their optical properties are summarized in Table 1. The absorption peaks in ethanol and in film for Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr are 305 and 306 nm and 302 and 304 nm, respectively. Interestingly, both Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr show much broader absorption in film than in solution, which means that the solid films of Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr form strong intermolecular aggregation.43 This is possibly results from the enhanced planarity of Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr by intramolecular cyclization. Bphen-Et displays stronger broadening absorption in film than Bphen-Pr. This may be because the hexatomic ring in Bphen-Et has higher structural planarity than the heptatomic ring in Bphen-Pr, where the difference between the structural planarity could affect the molecular stacking and aggregation in solid films.

CV was used to investigate the electrochemical properties of Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr, and the related CV curves are shown in Fig. 2b. The redox potential (E1/2) of ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) was 0.45 V relative to the reference electrode (SCE) under the same experimental conditions. The redox potential of Fc/Fc+ has an absolute energy level of −4.80 eV relative to the vacuum energy level;44 hence, the EHOMO and ELUMO of the conjugated molecules could be calculated according to the empirical equations: EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.80 − 0.45) eV and ELUMO = −e(Ere + 4.80 − 0.45) eV, where, Eox and Ere are the onset oxidation and reduction potentials vs. SCE under the given experimental conditions, respectively. Fig. 2b shows that the Eoxs and Eres are 2.28 and 2.32 V and −0.19 and −0.17 V for Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr, respectively. Hence, the EHOMO and ELUMO values of Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr were calculated to be −6.63, −6.67 and −4.16 and −4.18 eV, respectively. To further verify the HOMO energy levels of Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr, we also used another method, namely, photoelectron yield spectroscopy (PYS). The PYS curves are presented in Fig. 2(c and d). The EHOMOs measured by PYS were estimated to be −6.50 and −6.54 eV for Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr, respectively, which are relatively close to the values determined by CV. The ELUMOs of Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr are deep and comparable with that of PC61BM and PC71BM (from −3.8 to −4.3 eV),45 which indicates that Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr may form good ohmic contacts with fullerene derivatives, and thereby minimize the energy barriers of electron transport from the active layers to the cathodes and improve the electron-extraction efficiency. The EHOMOs (<−6.6 eV) of Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr are significantly deeper than that of PC61BM and PC71BM (approximately −6.0 eV), which implies that the relatively low-lying EHOMOs help to block hole carriers from donors in the active layers.46 The electrochemical properties of Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr indicate that these two cationic semiconducting molecules are potentially efficient cathode modifiers for PSCs.
Photovoltaic performance
The cathode modification properties of Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr as CILs were investigated. Therefore, a conventional BHJ PSC with the device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/poly{4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-4,6-diyl} (PTB7):[6,6]-phenyl-C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM)/CIL/Al was fabricated and tested.42 The device configuration and corresponding energy level diagram are shown in Fig. 3a and 2b, respectively. The thin CILs (Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr) were spin coated on top of the BHJ active layers from 4 mg mL−1 and 1.5 mg mL−1 MeOH solutions for Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr, respectively. The spin-coating speed for the CILs was 2000 rpm for 30 s. For comparison, control devices without CILs and with different solution concentrations of Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr (Fig. S3 and Table S1, ESI†) were also fabricated and tested. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs were measured at AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2), which are shown in Fig. 3c. All the corresponding photovoltaic parameters, including Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE as estimated from the J–V curves are summarized in Table 2. Fig. 3c shows that the control device with a bare Al cathode gave the highest PCE of 4.72%, with a Voc of 0.57 V, Jsc of 15.65 mA cm−2 and FF of 52.9%. However, after inserting thin layers of Bphen-Et or Bphen-Pr, the resulting PSCs exhibited a distinct performance enhancement, which is ascribed to the simultaneous improvements in Voc, Jsc and FF. For the CIL of Bphen-Et, the Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE values increased to 0.76 V, 15.90 mA cm−2, 66.1% and 7.98%, respectively. The corresponding Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE values also improved to 0.74 V, 16.05 mA cm−2, 67.8% and 8.05% for Bphen-Pr, respectively. The photovoltaic performance was enhanced significantly when the CILs of Bphen-Et or Bphen-Pr were used between the active layer and the Al cathode.

Table 2 shows the enhanced performances of Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr resulting from the increased Voc, Jsc and FF, which may be attributed to the formation of versatile ohmic contact at the cathode side and the better charge-transport ability of Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr compared with bare Al. The performances can be verified from the changes in series resistance (Rs) and parallel resistance (Rsh) of the PSCs. The Rss decreased from 56 to 43 and 38 Ω for bare Al, Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr, respectively. Conversely, the Rshs increased from 3080 to 4832 and 4971 Ω for bare Al, Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr, respectively. In addition, it is well known that the decrease in work function (WF) of the cathode also improves the ohmic contact in PSCs.47 We characterized the WF changes of the Ag electrode using scanning Kelvin probe microscopy.42 The WF of bare Ag is ∼4.80 eV. When the Ag electrode is treated with Bphen-Et or Bphen-Pr by spin coating, the WFs shift to 4.47 and 4.35 eV, respectively. This means that the introduction of Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr CILs decreases the WFs of cathodes distinctly. Furthermore, the LUMO energy levels of Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr are as deep as −4.16 and −4.18 eV, respectively, which make electron-transportation feasible. Also, the deeper HOMO energy levels of −6.63 and −6.67 eV for Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr, respectively, can serve as versatile hole-blocking layers, which may reduce energy loss. Compared with the devices that were subjected to bare Al, those with Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr CILs showed a significantly superior performance, which indicates that Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr are efficient interface-modification layers for cathodes. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the PSCs with or without CILs are shown in Fig. 3d. These three types of devices exhibit similar EQE spectra over the measured wavelength range. In the wavelength region from 300 to 800 nm, the EQEs of the device with the Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr layers show a clear improvement over the bare Al device, which result in a higher Jscs.
To obtain a more insightful understanding of the device performance improvements upon the incorporation of Bphen-Et or Bphen-Pr layers in the PSCs, the J–V characteristics of the PSCs were measured in the dark, as shown in Fig. 4.16 From −3 to 3 V, the devices with the Bphen-Et or Bphen-Pr CILs exhibit a significant decrease in reverse leakage current compared with the devices without CILs. Previous studies reported that a depressed reverse dark current contributes to Voc enhancement when using WSCP CILs in PSCs.16,48 Hence, the increase in Voc for the devices with Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr CILs may benefit from a reduction in reverse dark current. Notably, the sequentially decreased reverse leakage currents are consistent with the increases in Rsh and Voc in the Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr-covered devices. More obvious turn-on voltages were exhibited from 0 to 3 V for the Bphen-Et- and Bphen-Pr-deposited devices compared with the bare Al cathode. The turn-on voltages for the Bphen-Et- and Bphen-Pr-treated devices were ∼0.54 V. These increased turn-on voltages suggest that the Vbi across the devices improved when Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr were spin coated on top of the active layer.49

Charge transport properties
To evaluate the apparent charge transport properties of the PSC devices subjected to different treatments, the J–V characteristics of the electron-only devices were measured and the results were fitted using a space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model, as shown in Fig. 5. The structure of the electron-only device was ITO/ZnO/PTB7:PC71BM/CILs/Ca/Al. The deposition conditions for the active and cathode interfacial layers were the same as that used for the PSC devices. The mobilities were calculated by fitting the J–V curves to the SCLC model, as described by the equation J = 9ε0εrμV2/(8d3), where J is the current density, ε0εr is the dielectric permittivity of the active layer, μ is the zero-field mobility, d is the thickness of the active layer and V is the effective voltage.50 The apparent electron mobilities of 1.57 × 10−3, 1.81 × 10−3 and 2.04 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 were achieved for the bare Al, Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr-based devices, respectively. The electron mobilities were improved by using Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr as CILs. These results imply that the charge-transport ability was enhanced by the incorporation of the Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr layer, which is responsible for the increase in FF.

Morphology
To investigate the influence of the Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr CILs on the morphologies of the underlying active layers, atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode was utilized to analyze the surface morphologies of the PTB7:PC71BM films subjected to different CILs, as shown in Fig. 6. The deposition conditions were the same as that for the preparation of the PSCs. After the deposition of Bphen-Et or Bphen-Pr CILs, they displayed nano-scale aggregation. This is possibly due to the highly hydrophilic properties of Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr relative to the underlying PTB7:PC71BM active layer. Although the surface was not smooth and homogeneous, they can form a uniform cover which is beneficial for improving photovoltaic performance owing to the decreased contact resistance. Furthermore, these CILs may form a protective layer to prevent Al from diffusing into the active layer and quenching excitons, thus decreasing interfacial loss.16,17 However, the Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr based CILs did not result in excellent morphologies with versatile smooth and homogeneous films in this case; thus it is potentially attractive to develop and prepare better CILs based on Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr derivatives for achieving high-performance PSCs.

Conclusions
Two Bphen-based cationic compounds (Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr) were designed and synthesized via a simple intramolecular cyclization reaction. These small molecules are obtained in high yields (>90%). They exhibit high solubility in both water and alcohol (methanol and ethanol). Due to the formation of nitrogen cations in the Bphen backbones, the LUMOs and HOMOs of Bphen-Et and Bphen-Pr decrease to approximately −4.10 eV and −6.60 eV, respectively, which favor electron transport from the active layer to the cathode. The incorporation of a thin layer of Bphen-Et or Bphen-Pr at the interface between the PTB7:PC71BM active layer and the Al cathode yielded a significant improvement in photovoltaic performance compared with the bare Al-based device. Therefore, the cationic Bphen-based derivatives investigated herein are promising candidates for use in the CILs of highly efficient BHJ PSCs.
