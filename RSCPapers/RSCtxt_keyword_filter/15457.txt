    , Accepted 5th April 2018First published on 17th April 2018AbstractA Cu2O/BiVO4 p–n heterojunction based photoanode in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is fabricated by a two-step electrodeposition method on an FTO substrate followed by annealing treatment. The structures and properties of the samples are characterized by XRD, FESEM, HRTEM, XPS and UV-visible spectra. The photoelectrochemical activity of the photoanode in water oxidation has been investigated and measured in a three electrode quartz cell system; the obtained maximum photocurrent density of 1.72 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE is 4.5 times higher than that of pristine BiVO4 thin films (∼0.38 mA cm−2). The heterojunction based photoanode also exhibits a tremendous cathodic shift of the onset potential (∼420 mV) and enhancement in the IPCE value by more than 4-fold. The enhanced photoelectrochemical properties of the Cu2O/BiVO4 photoelectrode are attributed to the efficient separation of the photoexcited electron–hole pairs caused by the inner electronic field (IEF) of the p–n heterojunction.
1. Introduction
Nowadays, research and development of highly efficient and environment-friendly materials enabling solar-to-fuel conversion is highly desired to balance our long-term dependence on fossil-based fuels.1–3 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting or carbon dioxide reduction can convert solar energy into chemical fuels in the form of H2 or hydrocarbon compounds, which is regarded as a promising and cost-effective pathway.4–6 Compared to the two-electron H2-evolution reaction (HER), the water oxidation half-reaction that occurs in the photoanode is a speed-limiting step in the overall PEC water splitting because it requires a four-electron oxidation of two water molecules coupled to the removal of four protons to form a relatively weak oxygen–oxygen bond.7,8 The decisive factor of energy storage depends on the photocatalytic efficiency of the semiconductors used in the photoanode.9 Furthermore, a large number of visible-light driven semiconductors (such as BiVO4,10,11 Ta3N5,12,13 WO3,14,15 Fe2O3,16,17 CoO,18 Ag3PO419 and C3N420) have also been discovered in recent years. Among them, BiVO4 has received great attention since it has a good capability to harvest visible light and a high theoretical efficiency of 9.1%.21 However, the performance of a BiVO4 photoanode is limited as it suffers from the slow transport of carriers and excessive electron–hole recombination.22,23 In order to improve the PEC activity of BiVO4, many attempts have been made, including controlling morphologies, forming composite structures or heterojunctions, doping or composition tuning, and coupling with oxygen evolution catalysts (OECs).24 It has been demonstrated that the heterojunction photocatalysts fabricated by combining two semiconductors have the capability of separating photogenerated electron–hole pairs efficiently, leading to the enhancement of photoelectrochemical performance.25 In particular, coupling one p-type semiconductor with one n-type semiconductor is expected to exhibit much high separation efficiency of the photoinduced electron–hole pairs and therefore much higher photoelectrochemical performance, because the p–n junction may result in the photogenerated electrons and holes migrating to opposite directions. For instance, it was reported that the heterogeneous p–n junction photoanode of Cu2O/CeO2 showed 10 times enhancement compared to pristine BiVO4 for incident photon-to-current efficiencies under illumination at 450 nm.26 The p–n heterojunction of Co3O4/BiVO4 also showed a remarkable improvement in photocurrent for water oxidation when the Co3O4 layer was decorated on the surface of the BiVO4 layer.27 CuO with a direct bandgap of 2.0 eV is an attractive p-type oxide for photoelectrochemical water splitting and has a corresponding theoretical photocurrent density of 14.7 mA cm−2 based on the AM 1.5 spectrum due to Cu2O possessing favorable energy band positions. Since BiVO4 has appropriate conduction and valence band edges, the bandgap of BiVO4 matched well with CuO for efficient charge carrier separation. Therefore, developing Cu2O/BiVO4 as a p–n heterojunction photoanode for PEC water splitting is highly desirable.
In this study, we report an economical and reliable approach to fabricate the photoanodes of Cu2O/BiVO4 heterojunctions using a template-free two-step electrodeposition method and to enhance their photoelectrochemical water oxidation properties under visible-light illumination. For comparison, the synthesis methods and photoelectrochemical properties of BiVO4 based or Cu2O based p–n heterojunction photoanodes reported in the literature and in this work are listed in Table 1. Compared with previous literature reports,25–32 this new approach is of low-consumption and simple-preparation; especially, two-step electrodeposition could generate excellent contact between the interfaces of two semiconductors and thus it is easier to form a p–n heterojunction, leading to the admirable enhancement of photocurrent and incident-photon to current efficiencies. The mechanism of the Cu2O/BiVO4 heterojunction enhanced PEC water oxidation activity is also discussed in detail.

2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of BiVO4 photoanodes
The BiVO4 photoanode was prepared from a Bi metal precursor by a modified method reported previously.3 In a typical synthesis, a Bi metal film was first electrodeposited in a three electrode quartz cell system on the electrochemical workstation (CHI 660E, Shanghai ChenHua Instrument Co., Ltd). The FTO conductive glass substrate was used as a working electrode. An Ag/AgCl electrode and Pt wire were used as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The electrolyte was prepared by dissolving Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (0.4852 g) in a solution containing EG (100 mL) and H2O (50 mL). The deposition was carried out by passing 8.35 × 10−2 C cm−2 at E = −0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl. After electrodeposition, the Bi metal film was washed with ethanol and dried by blowing air. Then the Bi metal film was converted into BiVO4 by a chemical–thermal process. 200 μL of 0.2 mol L−1 VO(acac)2 DMSO solution were dropped onto the surface of the Bi metal film (geometric area = 2 cm2). The film was then heated at 450 °C for 2 hours in air. After calcination, the film was placed in a 1 mol L−1 NaOH solution for 30 min while stirring gently to remove the residual V2O5. Finally, after soaking in the NaOH solution, the resulting BiVO4 photoanode was obtained by washing with water thoroughly, and dried at 60 °C for 1 h.
2.2 Preparation of a Cu2O/BiVO4 heterojunction photoanode
Cu2O/BiVO4 heterojunction thin films were obtained by the second-step electrodeposition of Cu2O with varying composite quantities on the pre-prepared BiVO4 thin films. In a typical electrodeposition process, the source materials copper sulfate (0.4 M) and lactic acid (3 M) were dissolved in deionized water, and a concentrated sodium hydroxide solution (10 M) was slowly added to adjust the pH value to 9–12 while stirring. A constant potential between −0.25 and −0.5 V was applied to the BiVO4/FTO/glass substrates until passing 1 × 10−2–4 × 10−2 C, and then varying composite quantities of Cu2O nanoparticles were deposited on the BiVO4 thin films. The complete experimental procedure for fabrication of the Cu2O/BiVO4 heterojunction photoanode is sketched in Fig. 1.

2.3 Characterization
Crystallographic information of the samples was collected using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/MAX-2500 diffractometer, copper Kα radiation with λ = 0.154 nm). SEM images were obtained by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Zeiss Supra 55, at 20.0 kV). High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were noted on a JEOL JEM-2010 microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a VGESCALAB-MK electron spectrometer with Al Kα as the excitation source.
2.4 Photoelectrochemical test
For PEC tests, the measurements were conducted on a three-electrode configuration in a quartz cell. The prepared heterojunction working electrode with a 2 cm2 exposure area was placed in a cell with a Pt counter electrode and Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The cell was filled with a 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH = 7), and the light source employed in the PEC tests was a 300 W xenon lamp with an AM 1.5 G filter. The linear sweep voltammograms were obtained at 20 mV s−1 in a potential range from −0.4 to 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl both in the dark and under illumination. All potentials mentioned were converted into the potential versus RHE (in volts) according to eqn (1): ERHE = EAg/AgCl + EAg/AgCl vs. NHE + 0.059pH(1)
The value of EAg/AgCl vs. NHE (versus the normal hydrogen electrode) in eqn (1) is 0.197 V at 20 °C. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed on the electrochemical workstation mentioned above at an open circuit voltage of 1.23 V vs. RHE under illumination with 0.1 V amplitude of perturbation and a frequency between 100 kHz and 0.1 Hz. The measured impedance data were fit to an appropriate equivalent circuit using the Zview software package (version 3.2c) to derive the resistance values. Mott–Schottky plots were obtained at room temperature in the dark. The incident photon to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the samples was measured under monochromatic light illumination at 1.23 V vs. RHE. Monochromatic light was generated using the Oriel Cornerstone 130 monochromator, and the output power was measured using a photodiode detector. The IPCE was calculated using eqn (2): IPCE = (1240J)/(λ·Plight)(2)where J is the measured photocurrent density (mA cm−2), λ is the wavelength of the incident light (nm) and P is the power density of monochromatic light at each wavelength (mW cm−2). Intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) measurements were conducted with a potentiostat (IM6ex, Zahner Co.) controlled by a Zahner IMPS electrochemical workstation. Intensity-modulated light was provided by a light-emitting diode (LED) that allowed superimposition of sinusoidal modulation (∼10%) on a dc illumination level. The wavelength of light was 430 nm with an average intensity of 2 mW cm−2 and the modulation amplitude of lamp voltage was 10 mV. The photocurrent as a function of frequency (from 0.1 Hz to 5 kHz) after the light was turned on was recorded. Electron transfer time τd was calculated according to eqn (3):33 τd = (2πfmax)−1(3)The fmax is the frequency at the apex of the semicircle in the spectroscopy.
3. Results and discussion
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-prepared samples are shown in Fig. 2. In the XRD pattern of a pure BiVO4 photoanode (red line), all diffraction peaks can be easily indexed to those of a monoclinic BiVO4 cell with lattice parameters of a = 5.194 Å, b = 5.090 Å, c = 11.697 Å and β = 90.39° (JCPDS no. 75-1866). The reflections (at 2θ = 28.9 and 30.5 degrees) in the pattern of BiVO4 can obviously be observed compared to the FTO glass substrate, and no other crystalline phase like V2O5 or Bi2O3 was detected. Similarly, the peaks at 2θ values of 36.44 and 42.33 were indexed to the (111) and (200) planes, respectively, of the cubic cuprous oxide phase (JCPDS no. 78-2076), and no other crystalline phase like CuO or Cu metal was detected as well (blue line). As for the XRD pattern of the as-achieved Cu2O/BiVO4 heterostructure photoanode (pink line), the dominant diffraction peaks are both from the monoclinic BiVO4 and cubic Cu2O nanocrystals as demonstrated in Fig. 2. This indicates that BiVO4 and Cu2O with separate phases coexist in the system, providing a chance of the formation of the p–n junction in the interface between BiVO4 and Cu2O.

The morphology and microstructure of BiVO4 and their composites were characterized by SEM and TEM. BiVO4 shows a particulate and irregular morphology (Fig. 2), and the particles distributed on the FTO glass substrate have sizes of 200–300 nm. The surface of BiVO4 is uniformly covered by sesame-like nanoparticles after Cu2O is electrodeposited (Fig. 3a). The microstructure and elemental distribution of Cu2O/BiVO4 are further revealed by TEM and EDS mappings. The elemental mappings display that the BiVO4 particles are thoroughly encapsulated by sesame-like Cu2O nanoparticles. The EDS mapping analyses are consistent with the SEM observation, where Cu2O particles are uniformly folded in the Cu2O/BiVO4 heterostructures. In addition, the atomic percentages of V element and Bi element are 6.98% and 6.79%, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3d, which is in keeping with the stoichiometric ratio of BiVO4. The microstructures of the Cu2O/BiVO4 sample detected by TEM are shown in Fig. 3e. It can be seen that the Cu2O particles are electrodeposited in a disperse manner on the as-prepared BiVO4 photoanode, consistent with the SEM images. Fig. 3f displays the HRTEM image of the Cu2O/BiVO4 heterostructure, in which the interface of Cu2O and BiVO4 was observed. Moreover, a clear fringe with an interval of 0.305 nm could be indexed to the (110) lattice plane of Cu2O and that of 0.226 nm agreed with the (211) lattice plane of BiVO4, which further demonstrated the existence of the heterojunction formed between Cu2O and BiVO4.

In order to elucidate the chemical states of elements in Cu2O/BiVO4, especially to study the oxidation states of decorated Cu species and the interaction between Cu2O and BiVO4, the XPS spectra of pristine BiVO4 and Cu2O/BiVO4 with a Cu2O loading amount of 3 × 10−2 C were investigated as shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4a reveals that both samples are composed of Bi, V, and O elements, while an additional peak assigned to the Cu element appears in the XPS spectrum of Cu2O/BiVO4, which indicates the presence of Cu species on BiVO4. Fig. 4b–d present the high resolution XPS scan spectra of Bi 4f, V 2p, and O 1s, respectively. The Bi 4f XPS spectra in Fig. 4b show that the binding energies of Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 for pristine BiVO4 occur at 158.7 and 164.05 eV,34 respectively, which are slightly lower than that of Cu2O/BiVO4, for which the Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 peaks appeared at 159.0 and 164.25 eV, respectively. The V 2p peak can be fitted with two peaks at 523.9 and 516.6 eV, which are assignable to V 2p1/2 and V 2p3/2 signals, respectively (Fig. 4c).35 At the same time, the O 1s spectra of pristine BiVO4 and Cu2O/BiVO4 shown in Fig. 4d exhibit the binding energies for O 1s (529.6 eV) core levels. While in the O 1s XPS spectrum of Cu2O/BiVO4, a new peak (531.1 eV) appears as compared to pristine BiVO4, which is probably caused by Cu2O loading and also indicates that the loaded Cu species exist in the oxide form. The peaks located at 529.6 and 531.1 eV (Fig. 4e) can be assigned to the oxygen species of the lattice oxygen of layer-structured Bi2O22+ and Cu2O, respectively.36,37 The above results indicated that Cu species were successfully decorated on BiVO4, and there was a strong interaction between both. Fig. 4f shows the main and satellite peaks of Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 core levels of Cu2O/BiVO4. It is well known that copper oxide can exist in two semiconducting phases, namely, CuO and Cu2O. The peaks located at 953.0 and 933.9 eV can be attributed to the Cu 2p1/2 and Cu 2p3/2 peaks of Cu2O. Moreover, the appearance of the CuO peak is probably because of surface oxidation caused due to instability of Cu2O in the PEC process. It is worthwhile to note that no CuO phase is detected in the XRD pattern of Cu2O/BiVO4 heterojunctions, suggesting that the amount of CuO in the heterostructures is under the detection limit of XRD.

Diffuse reflectance UV-visible spectra (DRS) were collected for BiVO4, Cu2O and Cu2O/BiVO4 photoanodes to understand the influence of the heterostructure on light harvesting capability. As demonstrated in Fig. 5a, the absorption edge of Cu2O/BiVO4 is extended compared to pristine BiVO4 and pristine Cu2O, which implies that the Cu2O/BiVO4 photoanode has better absorption capacity of visible light. It has been reported that the DRS are usually applied to evaluate the band edge of semiconductors. For a crystalline semiconductor, the relationship of band edge and optical absorption has been widely employed according to eqn (4): αEphoton = K(Ephoton − Eg)n/2(4)where α, Ephoton, K and Eg are the absorption coefficient, the discrete photo-energy, a constant and the bandgap energy, respectively. For direct and indirect semiconductors, the values of n are 1 and 4, respectively. As reported in previous literature, monoclinic BiVO4 and cubic Cu2O are direct semiconductors and thus the n value is 1. The Eg values of the three photoanodes are estimated from the plot of (αEphoton)2vs. Ephoton as shown in Fig. 5b. The absorption edge energies of the BiVO4 and Cu2O/BiVO4 heterostructures are 2.49 and 2.43 eV, respectively, evaluated by the extrapolated value (the straight line to the x axis) of Ephoton at α = 0.

PEC measurements were carried out to characterize the performance of the heterostructures and some influence factors are discussed meanwhile. The current–voltage behaviors of the photoanodes under illumination are revealed as shown in Fig. 6. The current–potential curves were measured from the backside of photoanodes in 0.1 M PBS, pH = 7. As we all know, Faraday's law of electrolysis is expressed as given in eqn (5): m = K·Q = K·I·t(5)where m is the mass of the material that is precipitated on an electrode, the scale factor of K is the electrochemical equivalent, and Q is the total quantity of electricity passing through the electrolyte (the multiplication of current intensity I and time t). Therefore, we can electrodeposit different amounts of Cu2O loading on the BiVO4 film photoanodes by passing different quantities of electricity. According to the calculation result of Faraday's law, the theoretical value of n(Bi)/n(Cu) is 7.42, close to the atomic percentage of 7.00 as tested by EDS (Fig. 3d). Fig. 6a shows a set of linear sweep voltammograms of pristine BiVO4 and Cu2O/BiVO4 heterojunction samples recorded in the dark and under illumination. It is observed that the Cu2O/BiVO4 heterojunction shows n-type photocurrent which increases with anodic bias. The Cu2O/BiVO4 heterojunction with a Cu2O loading amount of 3 × 10−2 C exhibited the maximum photocurrent density of 1.72 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, 4.5 times higher than that of pristine BiVO4 thin films (∼0.38 mA cm−2). However, the Cu2O loading amount of 4 × 10−2 C showed the lower photocurrent density compared to pristine BiVO4 films. As shown in Fig. 6a, the initial increase in the amount of Cu2O nanoparticles leads to increased number of photoelectrons while further increase in the loading amount (more than the optimum amount i.e. 3 × 10−2 C) is likely to cause an increase in the charge recombination rate in Cu2O, which may be due to its short exciton diffusion length.38 Additionally, an electric field built at the interface due to the formation of the p–n junction leads to the separation of charge carriers. To further elucidate the possible causes of enhanced photocurrent of the heterojunction, the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded. From the Nyquist plots of Fig. 6b, the charge transfer resistances (Rct) across the electrode/electrolyte interface were calculated and compared.

(g) The potential window of the electrodeposition of Cu2O films at different pH values. (h) Corresponding equivalent circuit of the above Nyquist plots. Rct is the charge transfer resistance across the electrode/electrolyte interface, Rs is the solution resistance, and CPE is the constant phase component. 
The Rct of Cu2O/BiVO4 is smaller than that of BiVO4, suggestive of the superior charge transport capability of the former. The results so obtained confirm the positive role of Cu2O nanoparticles in enhancing the PEC response of heterojunction samples.
Furthermore, we discussed the influence factors of pH values and deposition potentials when Cu2O was electrodeposited on the BiVO4 thin films. As shown in Fig. 6g, we discovered that Cu2O has different potential windows under different pH values. Cu2O electrochemical deposition is difficult to carry out with the low potential, and the Cu metal will be obtained while the high negative potential is provided. In this work, we obtained the optimum experimental conditions with −0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl and pH = 11. In the results of EIS, the higher light current density is corresponding to the lower resistance. Furthermore, in Fig. 6c and e, all the Cu2O/BiVO4 photoanodes electrodeposited with the Cu2O loading amount of 3 × 10−2 C exhibited higher photocurrent compared with pristine BiVO4, and the fitting resistance values decreased obviously as demonstrated in Fig. 6d and f.
Flat band potential plays an important role in deciding the photoelectrochemical performance of the photoelectrode obtained from the Mott–Schottky plots. Fig. 7a shows the Mott–Schottky plots of pristine Cu2O, and we can find that the curve slope is a negative value, which shows the p-type semiconductor features of pristine Cu2O. Similarly, we can confirm that pristine BiVO4 and the Cu2O/BiVO4 heterojunction show up the n-type semiconductor features from Fig. 7b and c. The capacitance (C) at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface with an AC signal frequency of 1 kHz was measured at varying electrode potentials under dark conditions. From the intercept of these Mott–Schottky curves, flat band potentials were calculated for all the samples using eqn (6): 1/C2 = 2/(eεε0ND)·(Eapp − EFB − kT/e)(6)where C is the capacitance at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface, F cm−2; e is the elementary charge, 1.60 × 10−19 C; ε is the relative dielectric constant, 68 for BiVO4;39ε0 is the permittivity of the vacuum, 8.85 × 10−12 F m−1; ND is the donor density, cm−3; Eapp is the applied potential, V; EFB is the flat band potential, V; k is the Boltzmann constant, 1.38 × 10−23 F m−1; and T is the absolute temperature, K. At room temperature, kT/e is the temperature dependent term 25 mV and can be ignored. The curves of 1/C2vs. voltage are shown in Fig. 7 and the slope of these curves gives the value of the flat band potential. It was found that the value of EFB decreases from 0.13 V for pristine BiVO4 to 0.1 V for the Cu2O/BiVO4 heterojunction. The negative shift of EFB implies the inhibition of the photoexcited electron–hole recombination. Moreover, the calculated carrier density (ND) of Cu2O/BiVO4 reached 6.8 × 1022 cm−3, which is substantially higher than that of the pristine BiVO4 photoanode (ni = 2.5 × 1022 cm−3), confirming that the p–n heterojunction can significantly enhance the carrier density of BiVO4. Meanwhile, the Fermi level of Cu2O/BiVO4 can be calculated according to eqn (7): Ef − Ei = k·T·ln(ND/ni)(7)where Ei is the intrinsic Fermi level for BiVO4, which is pinned to be at ∼0.35 eV below the conduction-band minimum.40 Therefore, the Fermi level of Cu2O/BiVO4 moves down to 0.38 eV as the equilibrium is established in the p-type Cu2O/n-type BiVO4 heterostructure (Fig. 9), which is in accordance with the negative shift of the flat band potential, resulting in band bending at the interface in the heterojunction. This is the formation of the p–n heterojunction in thermal equilibrium.41

The photocurrent onset potential of BiVO4 here is similar to those reported previously.42 Compared to pristine BiVO4, the onset potential of the Cu2O/BiVO4 heterojunction significantly reduces from 0.90 V to 0.48 V with a cathodic shift of 420 mV. This cathodic shift value is the highest amongst all reported ones, in which BiVO4 photoanodes were composited with a p-type semiconductor NiO, Cu2O or Co3O4.20,24,26 It clearly indicates that Cu2O has a severe positive effect on the PEC activity. Fig. 7e shows a set of linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of BiVO4 and Cu2O/BiVO4 heterostructure photoanodes under chopped light illumination, recorded in 0.1 M PBS at pH 7 both in the dark and under illumination. The LSVs clearly demonstrate that the Cu2O/BiVO4 heterostructure photoanode exhibits a fast light response, due to efficient charge separation and transport through p–n junctions. The current of Cu2O/BiVO4 photoanode did not decreased to zero at dark, this may be due to the catalytic behavior of Cu2O. Thus, the remarkable photocurrent density enhancement in the LSVs further confirms that the as-constructed Cu2O/BiVO4 heterostructures show enhanced PEC performance, compared to the pristine BiVO4 thin films. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) value is a critical index to study light conversion efficiency as shown in Fig. 7f. The Cu2O/BiVO4 heterostructure presents a higher IPCE value compared to BiVO4 from UV extending to the visible region. The IPCE of the former reaches 70.1% at 400 nm, which is 4.4 times as high as the latter. The IPCE value of BiVO4 drops down to zero at 520 nm, whereas the IPCE of Cu2O/BiVO4 does not decrease to zero until around 600 nm. The enhanced IPCE is partially associated with the improved light absorption of Cu2O/BiVO4, where the heterostructure photoanode exhibits more intensive absorption up to ∼650 nm (Fig. 5a). In order to understand how a heterojunction improves PEC water oxidation, the charge transfer and surface recombination kinetics were quantified by intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS). When illuminated by light with a sinusoidal time-dependent intensity under short-circuit conditions, the photocurrent lags behind the incident light, leading to a response in the fourth quadrant (positive real, negative imaginary) of the complex plane as demonstrated in Fig. 8. The semicircle in the first quadrant is associated with the competition between interfacial minority carrier transfer and electron–hole recombination. The phase shift of the IMPS semicircle is a result of the time delay between the carrier generation and collection. The transient time of the electron (τd) was calculated according to the characteristic frequency apex of IMPS imaginary components. Obviously, pristine BiVO4 has a longer transport time. More specifically, the τd values for pristine BiVO4 and the Cu2O/BiVO4 heterostructure are 2.5 ms and 1.5 ms, respectively, which indicates that the Cu2O/BiVO4 heterojunction can accelerate the charge separation and the electron transfer at the surface of the anode and interface with the electrolyte.

According to the results stated above, a tentative mechanism for PEC water oxidation on the Cu2O/BiVO4 photoanode was proposed. As is well documented in previous literature reports, in the heterostructure formed with p-type and n-type semiconductors, there is a space charge region caused by the opposite direction diffusion of electrons in n-type semiconductors and holes in p-type semiconductors, leading to a p–n junction at the interface of semiconductors and an inner electronic field from n-type semiconductors to p-type semiconductors. Based on the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) positions of two semiconductors, a band energy diagram has been prepared as shown in Fig. 9. The band edge positions of BiVO4 and Cu2O before coming into contact with each other are calculated using eqn (8) and (9): EVB = X − Ee + 0.5Eg(8) ECB = EVB − Eg(9)where Ee is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (∼4.5 eV), Eg is the bandgap and X is the absolute electronegativity of the semiconductor. The X values for Cu2O and BiVO4 are ∼4.84 eV (ref. 43) and 6.035 eV,44 respectively. The Eg values for Cu2O and BiVO4 are ∼2.0 eV and 2.45 eV,45 respectively. The calculated VB and CB values of p-type Cu2O are 1.34 and −0.66 eV, respectively, while the VB and CB values of n-type BiVO4 are calculated to be 2.76 and 0.31 eV, respectively. According to the VB and CB values of p-type Cu2O and n-type BiVO4 semiconductors, before coming into contact with Cu2O and BiVO4, the Fermi level of p-type Cu2O is lower than that of n-type BiVO4, and the CB edge of p-type Cu2O is higher than that of n-type BiVO4. After coming in contact with Cu2O and BiVO4, with the Fermi level of p-type Cu2O and n-type BiVO4 moving up and down, respectively, an internal electric field from n-type BiVO4 to p-type Cu2O at the equilibrium is established in the Cu2O/BiVO4 heterostructure as shown in Fig. 9.
 Fig. 9  Schematic energy diagram and charge transfer between p-type Cu2O and n-type BiVO4. 
On illumination as demonstrated, the photoexcited holes on the VB of BiVO4 can transfer to Cu2O, while the electrons on the CB of Cu2O transfer to BiVO4 that is driven by an internal electric field at the Cu2O/BiVO4 interface. The remaining electrons on the CB of BiVO4 transfer to the FTO layer and from there the electrons move toward the counter electrode through an external circuit and combine with the H+ ions. Hence the photoexcited electrons and holes in the Cu2O/BiVO4 heterostructure can be separated efficiently by the p–n junction formed between the p-type Cu2O and n-type BiVO4 interface; meanwhile the recombination of electron–hole pairs can be significantly reduced. Then, the dual light-absorbing properties of the heterostructure photoanode improve the utilization of light irradiated. That is to say, the wider bandgap BiVO4 (2.45 eV) absorbs shorter visible light and the narrower bandgap Cu2O (2.0 eV) absorbs longer visible light, as evidenced by UV-vis absorption and IPCE measurements. This configuration of two materials with different bandgaps favors better utilization of solar light.
4. Conclusion
The present study demonstrated that the Cu2O/BiVO4 p–n junction with varying loading amount of Cu2O nanoparticles by a two-step electrodeposition method offers better charge separation of photogenerated charge carriers and improved light absorption ability, when used as a photoanode in a PEC cell for splitting of water as compared to the pristine BiVO4 photoanode. Through systematic experiments, we discovered the electrochemical window of Cu2O and obtained the optimum experimental conditions with −0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl and pH = 11. In particular, the method of fabricating photoanodes demonstrates the nonnegligible advantages of simplicity, steerability and replicability. Such a composite photoanode exhibits a significant cathodic shift of the onset potential (∼420 mV), which is the largest shift amongst all BiVO4 based p–n heterojunction photoanodes ever reported. The photocurrent density of Cu2O/BiVO4 reaches as high as 1.72 mA cm−2 (at 1.23 V vs. RHE), 4.5 times higher than that of pristine BiVO4 thin films. Furthermore, 4-fold enhancement in the IPCE value (at 400 nm) is achieved. Besides, the negative shift of flat band potential, the enhancement of carrier density and the decrease in charge transport time are attributed to the p–n junction at the interface of semiconductors and an inner electronic field from n-type BiVO4 to p-type Cu2O. These results suggest that the future development of highly efficient visible light p–n junction photoanodes with highly enhanced performance should consider avoiding electron/hole recombination in order to enable efficient solar energy conversion and water splitting.
