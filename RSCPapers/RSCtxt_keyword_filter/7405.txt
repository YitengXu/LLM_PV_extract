    , Accepted 26th June 2020First published on 30th June 2020AbstractThin films of nickel oxide (NiOx), cobalt oxide (CoOx) and nickel–cobalt oxide (NiCoOx) were sputtered onto n-Si(111) surfaces to produce a series of integrated, protected Si photoanodes that did not require deposition of a separate heterogeneous electrocatalyst for water oxidation. The p-type transparent conductive oxides (p-TCOs) acted as multi-functional transparent, antireflective, electrically conductive, chemically stable coatings that also were active electrocatalysts for the oxidation of water to O2(g). Relative to the formal potential for water oxidation to O2, Eo′(O2/H2O), under simulated Air Mass (AM)1.5 illumination the p-TCO-coated n-Si(111) photoanodes produced mutually similar open-circuit potentials of −270 ± 20 mV, but different photocurrent densities at Eo′(O2/H2O), of 28 ± 0.3 mA cm−2 for NiOx, 18 ± 0.3 mA cm−2 for CoOx and 24 ± 0.5 mA cm−2 for NiCoOx. The p-TCOs all provided protection from oxide growth for extended time periods, and produced stable photocurrent densities from n-Si in 1.0 M KOH(aq) (ACS grade) under potential control at Eo′(O2/H2O) for >400 h of continuous operation under 100 mW cm−2 of simulated AM1.5 illumination.
Introduction
Silicon, with a band-gap of 1.1 eV, has been widely explored for use in photoelectrochemical water-splitting devices as either a photocathode or photoanode. However, Si rapidly corrodes and passivates oxidatively when in contact with aqueous alkaline electrolytes.1 The kinetically slow four-electron-transfer oxygen-evolution reaction (OER): 4OH− → 2H2O + O2 + 4e− (in alkaline media) has a high overpotential and requires electrocatalysts to proceed efficiently.2 Operationally useful overlayers on Si photoelectrodes thus would be electrocatalytic for the oxidation of H2O to O2(g), conformal on the Si surface even on nanostructured electrodes, and would facilitate conduction of photogenerated charge carriers across the solid/liquid interface.
OER electrocatalysts composed of precious metals, such as IrO2 and RuO23–5 exhibit high activity and high relative stability in aqueous acidic or alkaline media. Electrocatalysts formed using more abundant metals, such as transition-metal oxides derived from NiOx, CoOx and NiCoOx, have recently attracted considerable attention. n-Silicon photoanodes have been protected using highly transparent NiOx films formed by sol–gel processes,6 e-beam evaporation,7 drop-casting8 or reactive sputtering.9 Fe incorporation from the KOH solution into NiOx forms a nickel–iron oxyhydroxide that enhances the OER activity of such films.10 In alkaline solution, NiOx converts to structurally porous Ni(OH)2/NiOOH,11–13 which when used for protection from corrosion or passivation will affect the long-term integrity of photoelectrodes. CoOx has also been used as an OER catalyst as well as to produce interfacial layers to effect band-edge engineering on Si photoanodes for water oxidation. CoOx nanoparticles have been formed using cyclic voltammetry on glassy carbon substrates,14 whereas CoOx films have been formed by electrodeposition on rotating disk electrodes.15 Moreover, CoOx has been deposited by plasma-enhanced atomic-layer deposition (ALD) on a nanostructured p+n-Si electrode,16 and CoOx thin layers have been deposited by ALD as an interfacial layer between Si and NiOx.17 CoOx has a smaller band-gap, and is a less active electrocatalyst for water oxidation, than NiOx. Binary metal oxides, such as NiCoOx, have also been investigated as p-type transparent conductive oxides.18 Amorphous nanoporous Ni–Co binary oxide layers that act as an efficient OER catalyst have been fabricated by electrochemical deposition.19 P-type NiCo2Ox has been sputtered as a hole conducting protection layer onto n-Si and n-InP photoanodes, with a 2 nm Ni–Fe film serving as the OER catalyst.20 A co-sputtered Co/NiCoOx film on an n+pp+ Si tandem device configuration was investigated with back-side illumination in contact with 1.0 M KOH(aq).21
In this work, a series of earth-abundant p-TCOs consisting of NiOx, CoOx and NiCoOx, have all been deposited onto n-Si photoanodes using reactive RF-sputtering in a mutually common fabrication process. The Co oxides are more optically absorbing than the NiOx oxides, but Co oxides are less porous and more conductive than Ni oxyhydroxides. Using Si as a prototypical photoanode material, we have systematically evaluated and compared the activity and stability of these films at the compositional limits of pure Ni and pure Co oxides to the behavior of a mixed-metal intermediate composition oxide. We have also evaluated trends in stability, conductivity, junction interfacial energetics, and optical absorption properties when these thin film oxides were used as photoelectrode protective layers that are also intrinsically active electrocatalytically for water oxidation in alkaline media.
Experimental section
Materials and chemicals
All materials including sulfuric acid (H2SO4, J. T. Baker, ACS reagent, 95–98%), concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl, Sigma Aldrich, ACS Reagent 37%), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, Macron Chemicals, ACS grade 30%), concentrated ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH, Sigma Aldrich, ACS reagent 28–30%), buffered HF Improved (Transene Company Inc.), potassium hydroxide pellets (KOH, Macron Chemicals, ACS 88%), potassium hydroxide pellets (KOH, Mallinckrodt Chemicals, FCC), potassium ferrocyanide trihydrate (K4Fe(CN)6·3H2O, Acros, >99%), potassium ferricyanide (K3Fe(CN)6, Fisher Chemicals, certified ACS 99.4%), and sodium sulfate (Na2SO4, Sigma Aldrich, ACS Reagent >99.0%), were used as received. Except where specifically stated otherwise, the KOH was ACS grade. Deionized water with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm was obtained from a Millipore water purification system.
Preparation of substrates
Two types of 3-inch diameter Si wafers were used in this study. p+-Si(111) wafers were boron-doped, 380 ± 25 μm thick, prime grade, and had a resistivity ρ < 0.002 Ω cm (Addison Engineering, Inc.). n-Si(111) wafers were phosphorus-doped with ρ = 0.1–1 Ω cm (University Wafer, Inc.). The p-type wafers were cleaned by etching for 30 s in buffered HF, whereas the n-type wafers were cleaned using a modified RCA SC-2 procedure.22 Before film deposition, the samples were thoroughly rinsed with deionized H2O and dried under a flow of N2(g).
Deposition of NiOx, CoOx and NiCoOx with rate analysis
Reactive radio frequency sputtering was performed using an AJA high-vacuum magnetron sputtering system (AJA International Inc.) with a base pressure of 8 × 10−8 Torr. Sputtering was performed under a pressure of 5 mTorr while the Ar/O2 flow rate was maintained at 20/1 sccm. The RF power on Ni and Co targets (Kurt Lesker, 2′′ diameter × 0.125′′ thickness, 99.95%) was maintained at 150 W for sputtering of NiOx and CoOx. For sputtering of NiCoOx, the Ni and Co targets were held at 115 W and 125 W, respectively, to yield a similar sputtering rate to that used for deposition of NiOx and CoOx. During sputtering, the stage was maintained at 300 °C.
The oxide film thickness was measured by cross-sectional scanning-electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. S1a†) and stylus profilometery (Fig. S1b,† Bruker DektakXT, 2 μm tip, and resolution 1 nm). The sputtering rate for NiOx, CoOx and NiCoOx was ∼3.6 nm min−1, 3.0 nm min−1, and 5.0 nm min−1 respectively. The film thickness was monitored using an internal quartz crystal microbalance (Inficon, SQM-160).
Scanning-electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectra
Scanning-electron micrographs (SEMs) were obtained using a Nova NanoSEM 450 microscope (FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV and a working distance of 5.0 mm. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectra (EDS) were collected at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV using a Si drift detector (Oxford Instruments, Abingdon, United Kingdom). Inca software (Oxford Instruments) was used to interpret the EDS spectra.
Atomic-force microscopy
Atomic-force microscopy (AFM) was performed using a Bruker Dimension Icon operating in ScanAsyst mode with Bruker ScanAsyst-Air probes (silicon tip, silicon nitride cantilever, spring constant: 0.4 N m−1, frequency: 50–90 kHz). The scan size was 1 × 1 μm and the images were analyzed using NanoScope Analyst software (version 1.40).
X-ray diffraction spectroscopy
X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed using a Bruker D8 Discover system equipped with a 2-dimentional Vantec-500 detector. Cu-Ka radiation (1.54 Å) was generated at a tube voltage of 50 kV and a tube current of 1000 mA. The detected radiation was counted for 1 h. Data were analyzed using Bruker EVA software.
UV-visible transmission and absorption measurements
The optical transmittance of 75 nm-thick films of either NiOx, CoOx or NiCoOx on quartz substrates was measured with an integrating sphere at normal incidence (Aligent Cary 5000 UV-vis Spectrometer). The optical band-gaps were estimated using Tauc plots of hν versus (αhν)2, where α is the absorption coefficient determined from the Beer–Lambert law. The reflectivity of 75 nm-thick films of NiOx, CoOx and NiCoOx on n-Si was measured at normal incidence with the integrating sphere.
Measurements of faradaic efficiency for production of oxygen
The generated O2(g) was collected and measured in a home-built eudiometer. The mass of the generated O2(g) was calculated from the volume, pressure, and temperature of the eudiometer. The n-Si photoanodes coated with p-TCOs were used as working electrodes, with a geometric area of ∼1 cm2. The reference electrode was Hg/HgO (CH Instruments, CH152) and a glass-fritted carbon rod was used as the counter electrode. The current was maintained at 8 mA, resulting in a working electrode potential of ∼1.8 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The light intensity at the working electrode was ∼1/3 Sun. The expected amount of oxygen generated during 24 h of continuous operation was calculated from measurement of the charge in coulombs passed during operation, taking the oxygen-evolution reaction to be a 4-electron (hole) process, and assuming 100% faradaic efficiency for O2(g) production.
Resutls and discussions

Fig. 1 shows SEM images of 75 nm-thick NiOx (Fig. 1a), CoOx (Fig. 1b) and NiCoOx (Fig. 1c) films sputtered on p+-Si substrates. All of the sputtered films exhibited a granular surface morphology. AFM measurements indicated that the NiOx (Fig. 1d) had a surface roughness of 4.08 ± 0.03 nm; the CoOx (Fig. 1e) had a surface roughness of 4.24 ± 0.15 nm; and the NiCoOx (Fig. 1f) had a surface roughness of 3.33 ± 0.07 nm. EDS data were consistent with the formation of pure NiOx (Fig. 1g) and CoOx (Fig. 1h), with the Si signal arising from the substrate. EDS indicated a Ni:Co ratio of 1:1 ± 0.1 for the NiCoOx film (Fig. 1i).

Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of NiOx (red curve), CoOx (green curve) and NiCoOx (blue curve) sputtered onto glass. All of the sputtered films were polycrystalline and single phase. Fig. 2 (red curve) shows the XRD pattern of the NiOx film, which agrees well with cubic NiO (Bunsenite, JCPDS 01-071-1179). The preferred orientation was in the <111> direction. Fig. 2 (green curve) shows the XRD pattern of the CoOx film, which agrees well with cubic Co3O4 (Cobalt Oxide, JCPDS 01-073-1701). The preferred orientation was in the <311> direction. Fig. 2 (blue curve) shows the XRD pattern of the NiCoOx film, which agrees well with cubic NiCoO2 (cobalt nickel oxide, JCPDS 00-010-0188), and the preferred orientation was in the <111> direction. The NiCoOx XRD pattern is very similar to the NiOx XRD pattern, with all the peaks slightly shifted to lower angle, in accord with the lattice expansion that accompanies incorporation of Co into NiOx. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) indicated that the sputtered NiOx, CoOx and NiCoOx films were all p-type semiconductors with a doping density in the range of 1019 cm−3 (Fig. S2†).

Fig. 3a shows the transmittance spectra for the NiOx (red curve), CoOx (green curve) and NiCoOx (blue curve) films sputtered onto a quartz substrate, along with bare quartz (black curve) as a control. Bare quartz showed ∼93% transmittance in the wavelength range of 300–1100 nm. In contrast, in the visible wavelength range of 390–700 nm, 75 nm of NiOx showed an average transmittance of ∼70%, whereas 75 nm CoOx showed an average transmittance of ∼30%, and 75 nm NiCoOx showed an average transmittance of ∼60%. Fitting the linear portions of the Tauc plot (hv versus (αhv)2) of NiOx yielded direct band-gap transitions at 2.6 and 3.5 eV (Fig. 3b, red curve). The transmittance data for CoOx (Fig. 3a, green curve) clearly showed two absorption bands, with the band at ∼470 nm ascribable to the O2− → Co2+ charge-transfer process, while the band at ∼750 nm is ascribable to the O2− → Co3+ charge-transfer process. Fitting the linear potion of the Tauc plot (hv versus (αhv)2) of CoOx (Fig. 3b) yielded direct band-gap transitions at 2.5 and 1.6 eV. Fitting the linear potion of the Tauc plot (hv versus (αhv)1/2) for NiCoOx showed a direct band-gap transition at 3.0 eV by (Fig. 3b, blue curve).

Fig. 4a shows 20 continuous voltammetric cycles of p+-Si|NiOx (red curve), p+-Si|CoOx (green curve) and p+-Si|NiCoOx (blue curve) in 1.0 M KOH(aq) between 0.42 and 1.92 V versus RHE. The dark catalysis behavior typically reached steady state, without further improvement, after 20 J–E scans. Fig. 4b (red curves) shows that as a consequence of potential cycling, the overpotential for NiOx to produce 10 mA cm−2 of anodic current density (η10 mA cm−2) decreased from 500 ± 35 mV to 330 ± 5 mV, and the redox peaks became more prominent due to the formation of oxyhydroxide at the surface. Fig. 4b (green curves) shows that after voltammetric scanning, η10 mA cm−2 for CoOx increased from 390 ± 10 mV to 420 ± 10 mV, and the redox peaks of CoOx to CoOOH were not as prominent as in the conversion of NiOx to NiOOH. Fig. 4b (blue curves) shows that η10 mA cm−2 for NiCoOx decreased after voltammetric scanning from 418 ± 43 mV to 357 ± 5 mV, and also shows moderately pronounced redox peaks, because half of the surface is NiOx. The reported deviations in η10 mA cm−2 resulted from standard variation between samples.

Fig. S3† presents a detailed comparison of the XPS data for 75 nm-thick NiOx, CoOx and NiCoOx films on Si before, and after, respectively, 20 voltammetric scans in 1.0 M KOH(aq). For NiOx and NiCoOx, the Ni 2p3/2 peak exhibited an obvious transition from Ni2+ (∼853.6 eV) to Ni3+ (∼855.7 eV) (Fig. S3a†), in accord with expectations for the transformation of NiO to NiOOH. In contrast, no obvious difference between the spectra acquired before and after 20 scans in KOH (Fig. S3b†) was observed for the Co 2p3/2 peak in either CoOx or NiCoOx, This behavior is consistent with the expected very small peak shift between CoOx and CoOOH. The O 1s peak (Fig. S3c†) showed a transition from lattice oxygen (∼529.5 eV) to surface hydroxyl groups (∼531.4 eV) after voltammetric cycling, further confirming the formation of NiOOH as well as possibly indicating the formation of CoOOH.
Fe can play a critical role in enhancing the activity of NiOx-based OER electrocatalysts.10 From high-resolution XPS scans of the Fe 2p region, the Fe incorporation was 14.2% for NiOx, 11.4% for CoOx, and 8.4% for NiCoOx (Fig. S4†) after 20 voltammetric scans in 1.0 M KOH(aq). The intercalation of trace quantities of Fe correlated well with the enhancement of the OER catalytic activity of NiOx (Fig. 4b red curves). However, incorporation of trace Fe did not have a substantial effect on the OER catalytic activity of CoOx, actually diminishing the activity slightly (Fig. 4b, green curves). Similar amounts of Fe (8% from XPS) incorporated during 2 h of potential control at 1.58 V vs. RHE have led to a ten-fold increase in the intrinsic activity of electrochemically deposited Co(OH)2 films.23 Differences in the amount of electrochemically accessible Co(Fe)OOH within sputtered CoOx, relative to electrochemically deposited Co(OH)2, could account for this discrepancy.
The OER catalytic activity of these three films was further investigated in FCC grade 1.0 M KOH(aq), which contains less Fe than the ACS grade KOH used in the experiments described above. As shown in Fig. S5,† based on the 20thJ–E scans of NiOx, CoOx and NiCoOx in FCC grade 1.0 M KOH(aq) (Fig. S5†), η10 mA cm−2 = 600 ± 5 mV for NiOx and η10 mA cm−2 = 440 ± 8 mV for CoOx, whereas NiCoOx showed the lowest overpotential, η10 mA cm−2 = 390 ± 5 mV. After 20 voltammetric scans in FCC grade 1.0 M KOH(aq), the high-resolution XPS spectra in the Fe 2p region showed almost no detectable Fe signal on NiOx and CoOx surfaces, and the NiCoOx surface exhibited ∼2% Fe (Fig. S6†).

Fig. 5a displays the reflectance spectra of 75 nm thick films of NiOx (red curve), CoOx (green curve) and NiCoOx (blue curve) on an n-Si substrate. A freshly etched n-Si substrate showed an average of ∼40% reflection in the visible range (Fig. 5a, black curve). NiOx, CoOx or NiCoOx films all acted as antireflection coatings, substantially suppressing the large reflection loss from the smooth n-Si photoelectrode, while exhibiting a minimum reflection signal at ∼600 nm. The NiOx and NiCoOx coatings made the shiny silver-looking Si electrode appear dark blue in color, whereas the Si electrode appeared light green after being coated with CoOx. The NiOx coating showed lower reflection in the visible range than CoOx or NiCoOx films (Fig. 5a).
 Fig. 5  (a) Reflectance spectra of 75 nm-thick NiOx (red curve), CoOx (green curve) and NiCoOx (blue curve) on n-Si, as well as a freshly etched n-Si substrate (black curve). (b) External quantum yield (Φext) of 75 nm-thick NiOx (red curve), CoOx (green curve) and NiCoOx (blue curve) on n-Si measured in 1.0 M KOH(aq, ACS grade) at 1.75 V versus RHE. (c) J–E behavior (at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1) of n-Si|NiOx (solid red curve), n-Si|CoOx (solid green curve) and n-Si|NiCoOx (solid blue curve) under simulated AM1.5 illumination and n-Si|NiOx (dotted red curve), n-Si|CoOx (dotted green curve) and n-Si|NiCoOx (dotted blue curve) in the dark in contact with 1.0 M KOH(aq, ACS grade). 
The reflectance behavior is consistent with the external quantum yield (Φext) data measured on n-Si photoanodes formed with these three different TCO coatings. Fig. 5b presents Φext measurements for 75 nm-thick NiOx, CoOx and NiCoOx films coated on n-Si in ACS grade 1.0 M KOH(aq) at 1.75 V versus RHE. The NiOx coated n-Si photoelectrodes showed the highest external quantum yield, ∼0.75, in the 600–800 nm wavelength range (Fig. 5b, red curve). The NiCoOx displayed a slightly lower external quantum yield, with an average of ∼0.65 in the 600–800 nm wavelength range (Fig. 5b, blue curve). In contrast, CoOx exhibited the lowest external quantum yield, with an average of ∼0.50 in the wavelength range of 600–800 nm (Fig. 5b, green curve). The n-Si photoelectrodes coated with CoOx also exhibited two broad valleys in the spectral response, at 470 nm and 750 nm, consistent with the transmittance and reflectance measurements (Fig. 3 and 5).

Fig. 5c presents the J–E behavior in the presence and absence, respectively, of Air Mass (AM)1.5 illumination, for n-Si|NiOx (red curves), n-Si|CoOx (green curves) and n-Si|NiCoOx (blue curves) in contact with ACS grade 1.0 M KOH(aq). The open-circuit photovoltage, Voc, short-circuit photocurrent density, Jsc, and fill factor, ff, of a photodiode that would produce the same shift in J–E behavior as that observed for the n-Si photoanodes relative to p+-Si dark anodes, both coated with nominally the same film in each case, was extracted from a load-line analysis (see ESI†) of the J–E behavior of n-Si electrodes relative to p+-Si electrodes (Table 1). As expected from the transmittance and reflectance characteristics (Fig. 3 and 5), CoOx films produced the lowest Jsc values and NiOx produced the highest Jsc values. The open-circuit voltage showed relatively little variation between coatings. The fill factors reflected a trade-off between decreasing Jsc values and increasing η10 mA cm−2 as the film composition was changed from NiOx to NiCoOx and then to CoOx, with NiCoOx having the lowest fill factor due to the co-variation in these performance characteristics resulting from changes in the film composition. Despite the reductions in Jsc and changes in ff, the ideal regenerative cell photoelectrode efficiencies, ηIRC,24 varied relatively little as the film composition was changed.

Impedance measurements on n-Si|NiOx, n-Si|CoOx and n-Si|NiCoOx electrodes analyzed with an equivalent circuit consisting of a resistor in series with a parallel combination of a resistor and capacitor yielded good fits to semicircles in Nyquist plots. Mott–Schottky analysis (Fig. S7†) of the impedance behavior of coated n-Si electrodes in contact with 50 mM Fe(CN)63− and 350 mM Fe(CN)64− in 1.0 M Na2SO4(aq) in the dark yielded a flat-band potential, Vfbvs. the Nernstian potential of the Fe(CN)63−/4− solution of −0.519 ± 0.002 for NiOx, −0.552 ± 0.005 for CoOx, and −0.528 ± 0.003 V for NiCoOx films, respectively. The flat-band data are consistent with the slightly higher Voc observed for CoOx-coated electrodes relative to n-Si|NiOx or n-Si|NiCoOx electrodes (Table 1).
Fig. S8† depicts the faradaic efficiency for production of O2(g) by n-Si|NiOx, n-Si|CoOx and n-Si|NiCoOx photoelectrodes in contact with ACS grade 1.0 M KOH(aq) under simulated AM1.5 illumination. A current density of ∼8 mA cm−2 produced a potential of ∼1.8 V versus RHE for these activated electrodes, with illumination maintained for 24 h. The mass of O2 expected from the total photogenerated charge passed, assuming 100% faradic efficiency, was in excellent agreement with the mass of O2 observed by water displacement.

Fig. 6 presents the photoelectrochemical behavior of n-Si|NiOx, n-Si|CoOx and n-Si|NiCoOx photoanodes in contact with ACS grade 1.0 M KOH(aq) under simulated AM1.5 illumination. Fig. 6a, b and c display the J–E data collected during the stability evalution on n-Si|NiOx, n-Si|CoOx and n-Si|NiCoOx respectively, after 0, 200 or 400 h of continuous operation. Fig. 6a shows that the NiOx-coated photoanode degraded after 400 h of continuous operation at 1.75 V vs. RHE, exhibiting a distinct decrease in ff. During this time period, the light-limited current density decreased by 21.2%, from 28.7 to 22.6 mA cm−2. SEM data (inset) indicated the formation of 2–5 μm diameter pinholes. This behavior is consistent with the conversion, during the electrochemical measurements, of NiOx to structurally porous Ni(OH)2/NiOOH, which partially exposes the Si photoanode surface to the corrosive KOH solution. In contrast, CoOx-coated n-Si photoanodes were quite stable even after 400 h of continuous operation at 1.75 V vs. RHE bias in ACS grade 1.0 M KOH(aq) (Fig. 6b). The light-limited current density actually increased by 21.3%, from 19.2 to 23.3 mA cm−2, after 400 h of continuous operation. SEM data (inset) showed the formation of 10–50 μm diameter pinholes, but the dissolution and re-organization of the film enabled more light to pass through and hence increased the photocurrent density. After 400 h of continuous operation under 1.75 V vs. RHE bias in ACS grade 1.0 M KOH(aq), NiCoOx-coated n-Si photoanodes exhibited a moderate decrease in ff (Fig. 6c). The light-limited current density increased by 9.8%, from 23.5 to 25.8 mA cm−2, after 60 h continuous operation, which is consistent with dissolution of CoOx. The light-limited current density decreased from 25.8 to 20.1 mA cm−2 at the end of 400 h continuous operation, corresponding to a 14.4% decrease from its initial value (Fig. 6d). The conversion of NiOx to structurally porous Ni(OH)2/NiOOH during the stability test dominated the performance of NiCoOx electrodes, eventually leading to a slow decrease of the photocurrent at 1.75 V vs. RHE. The SEM data (inset) indicated the formation of 5–20 μm diameter pinholes, which is between the pinhole size generated in NiOx and CoOx films.

(d) Chronoamperometry of n-Si|NiOx (red solid dot), n-Si|CoOx (green hollow dot) and n-Si|NiCoOx (blue hollow square) for 400 h in 1.0 M KOH (aq, ACS grade) under AM1.5 illumination, with the electrode potential held at 1.75 V versus RHE, and the electrochemical cell under air flow cooling (to prevent heating of the electrode and solution). 
Fig. S9† displays XPS survey scans of the 75 nm-thick TCO-coated n-Si|NiCoOx photoanodes before and after, respectively, 400 h of continuous operation under Air Mass (AM) 1.5 illumination in ACS grade 1.0 M KOH(aq). Signals in both the Ni 2p region and Co 2p region diminished substantially after the 400 h stability test, whereas trace impurities were absorbed from the solution. Detailed examination indicated the presence of trace amounts of Fe, Ag, Cu, N, Ca, As and Cl on the electrode surface, either from the solution or from the glassware used in the stability test experiment.
The comparison performed herein indicates that the increased optical absorption resulting from partial substitution of Co for Ni decreases the photocurrent density and thus deleteriously affects the efficiency of planar Si photoanodes coated uniformly with these TCO films. The results also suggest, however, that Co-containing TCO's could be advantageously exploited as multi-functional protection layers in conjunction with strategies that minimize optical absorption losses on photoelectrodes, such as formation of microcone arrays,25 dispersion of the catalyst into nanometer-sized islands onto the electrode surface,26,27 or similar approaches that minimize the effects of absorption and reflection losses in the catalyst while maintaining the beneficial effects of p-type TCO films that can enhance the stability of the coated photoanode in the catalyst-coated regions of the Si light absorber.
The thickness of p-TCOs analyzed in this work was kept consistent to compare the effect of film composition on OER activity and stability. Increased photocurrents could be obtained at Si photoanodes coated with thinner p-TCO films containing Co without a substantial reduction in OER activity. The interface between the p-TCOs and Si was not optimized in this work, due to the damage caused by the high-energy ions during sputtering. Moreover, sputtered p-TCO films only provide enhanced photoelectrode performance on planar, self-passivating semiconductor surfaces, due to the directional film growth of sputtering as well as the formation of defects and pinholes during film growth. Alternative methods, such as atomic-layer deposition (ALD), may improve the interfacial energetics and enable film deposition on high-aspect ratio, nanostructured surfaces and other surfaces and morphologies where such approaches can provide enhanced stability as well as catalytic activity in conjunction with favorable anti-reflection coating properties. Silicon photoanodes could be a potential component of a tandem light-absorber structure for a complete integrated solar-fuels device, and also provide a proof-of-concept of the implementation of the TCO-coating approach for a variety of photoelectrode materials and systems.
Conclusions
NiOx, CoOx and NiCoOx films prepared using RF reactive sputtering are intrinsically p-type, optically transparent, electrically conductive oxides that form a heterojunction with Si that enables hole conduction. All of the films acted not only as a protection layer but also were active catalysts for the oxygen-evolution reaction in aqueous alkaline media. The films yielded relatively stable photoanodes for production of O2(g) in 1.0 M KOH(aq) for 400 h under simulated AM1.5 illumination. Collectively this family of materials offers the ability to tune the porosity, optical absorption and catalytic properties to obtain optimized protection layers for a variety of distinct photoanode morphologies, optimizing light management while minimizing exposure of the absorber to the corrosive electrolyte.
