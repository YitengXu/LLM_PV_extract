    , Accepted 29th September 2011First published on 11th October 2011AbstractIn this study, we investigated interfacial charge transfer dynamics in water-soluble perylenediimide (WS-PDI) dye sensitized p-type semiconductor NiO nanoparticle films to better understand how molecular interactions influence photoconversion processes involved in solar cells by means of ensemble-averaged and single-molecule spectroscopies. Transient absorption data showed that strong and weak electronic couplings coexist between WS-PDI molecules and NiO nanoparticles, resulting in fast (within several picoseconds) and slow (requiring tens of picoseconds to nanoseconds) hole transfer from the excited dye to NiO, followed by charge recombination occurring at pico- to microsecond time scales. The correlated analyses of single-molecule fluorescence intensity, lifetime, blinking, and anisotropy revealed the intrinsic distribution and temporal fluctuation of interfacial charge transfer reactivity, which are closely related to site-specific molecular interactions and dynamics. It was also found that a suitable insulating Al2O3 layer can weaken the electronic interaction between WS-PDI and NiO, thereby retarding charge recombination and significantly enhancing photoelectric conversion efficiency. The results presented here will provide a reliable basis for design of highly efficient p-type solar cells and other molecule/semiconductor systems for their use in optoelectronic and solar energy applications.
Introduction

Dye-sensitized systems composed of semiconductors and dye molecules have been widely investigated for their remarkable applications in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),1–4 photocatalysis,5 and advanced molecular devices.6 In order to design highly efficient systems, a clear understanding of photoinduced charge transfer processes is required. Therefore, interfacial charge transfer processes between dye sensitizers and semiconductors have been widely investigated using ensemble-averaging approaches, such as transient absorption spectroscopy, during the past decades.7–18 In addition, molecular adsorption, electronic interactions, and electron transfer dynamics at the interfaces have been theoretically studied using quantum chemical methods.19,20 Many works have been focused on dye/n-type semiconductor systems such as TiO2 and ZnO because of the high efficiency of these systems. On the other hand, very few studies have been conducted on dye/p-type semiconductor systems, in which the p-type semiconductors can more easily accept the hole from dye sensitizers, because their energy conversion efficiency is lower than that of dye/n-type semiconductor systems.4,21 Therefore, a more comprehensive study of dye/p-type semiconductor systems is necessary to both understand the factors that control the rate of hole photo-injection and aid the rational design of efficient dye/p-type semiconductor systems for applications such as p-type DSSCs.21 In addition, such a study provides information that is helpful for the preparation of tandem DSSCs consisting of n-type and p-type semiconductors functioning as the anode and cathode, respectively.4,21

        NiO is a typical p-type semiconductor that has a wide range of applications. For example, NiO nanoparticles have been found to be promising materials for p-type DSSCs,22–29 gas sensors,30catalysts,31 magnetic materials,32 electrochromic devices,33 and fuel cells.34 For the application of NiO to p-type DSSCs, a detailed understanding of charge transfer in the dye/NiO system is very important. The initial process is the injection of holes from the dye molecules adsorbed on the NiO surface to the valence band (VB) of the NiO upon photoexcitation of the dye. The energy diagram of photoinduced processes in a dye-sensitized NiO system is represented in Fig. 1. For several systems, the dynamics of the charge transfer processes have been studied using transient absorption spectroscopy.23,24,26,27 However, further understanding of the interfacial charge transfer mechanism requires a detailed investigation of the distinct photophysical and photochemical phenomena on a nanometre scale, because it is difficult to investigate the charge transfer dynamics only by ensemble-averaged measurements owing to the inhomogenous nanoscale local environments and site-specific interaction of the molecules adsorbed on the nanoparticle surface.
 Fig. 1  Mechanistic scheme for hole injection from electronically excited dye to NiO nanoparticle. S0 and S1 are the grand and singlet excited states of the dye, respectively. CB is the conduction band and VB is the valence band. An Al2O3 overlayer on the NiO surface is also shown. 
Single-molecule spectroscopy has been demonstrated to be a powerful approach for studying complex systems and inhomogeneous dynamics and has been applied to interfacial charge transfer investigations.35,36 For instance, Lu and Xie studied single-molecule chemical reaction kinetics of interfacial electron transfer between cresyl violet and indium tin oxide (ITO).37 They observed photoinduced interfacial electron transfer from the photoexcited cresyl violet molecules to ITO. Since their pioneering work, several groups reported the dynamics of electron transfer from single dye molecules to n-type semiconductors (mostly TiO2).38–44Luet al. recently confirmed the fluorescence blinking dynamics arising from the interfacial electron transfer activity fluctuation and intermittency for various dye (such as coumarin 343, ZnTCPP)/TiO2 systems.39–42 More recently, Wu and Yeow studied the interfacial hole transfer process between single luminescent quantum dots (QDs) and NiO nanoparticles.45 However, systematic studies on the dynamics of the charge transfer processes in a dye-sensitized NiO system based on single-molecule spectroscopy are still lacking. By observing a single molecule, one can avoid undesired interferences, such as molecular aggregation, charge separation between dye molecules in the ground and excited states, multiple charge transfer events on a single particle surface, and charge trapping by neighboring intermediate species.
Herein, we have investigated the interfacial hole transfer dynamics of dye molecules adsorbed on NiO nanoparticle film at both the ensemble and single-molecule levels. We select water-soluble perylenediimide (WS-PDI, Fig. 1) as a reactive probe dye molecule, because it is representative of rylene derivatives, which are particularly appealing sensitizers for p-type DSSCs.21,27,46 Moreover, WS-PDI is known to be a photostable fluorophore and has a high extinction coefficient (∼3 × 104 M−1 cm−1) and a high fluorescence quantum yield (∼0.6);47 these properties are useful for conducting studies involving single-molecule experiments.47–50WS-PDI contains four active sulfonic groups that can be anchored on the NiO surface via chelation. Importantly, our experiments characterize WS-PDI/NiO systems in the presence of acetonitrile, which is often employed as an electrolyte solvent in actual DSSCs. Our method reproduces the actual conditions for DSSCs. Using this system, we explore the dynamics of the interfacial charge transfer reaction from individual dye molecules to p-type NiO nanoparticles, and furthermore, we clarify the influences of the surface Al2O3 coating as an insulating layer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy study on the interfacial charge transfer process between dye molecules and semiconductors with insulating metal oxide overlayers. Finally, we demonstrate that WS-PDI can photosensitize NiO to generate a photocurrent and that a suitable thickness of the Al2O3 layer can significantly improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency.
Experimental section
Synthesis of WS-PDI

Water-soluble perylenediimide (WS-PDI) was synthesized according to the literature.43,51 The structure of the dye is presented in Fig. 1.
Preparation of NiO nanoparticles film

Nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 99.999%) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 99.998%) were purchased from Aldrich. Nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) was prepared using a method described elsewhere.45 In a typical run of synthesis, 5 mL of 1.0 M NaOH solution was added slowly to 10 ml of 0.2 M Ni(NO3)2 solution under vigorous stirring. The solution was allowed to settle overnight, and the Ni(OH)2 was precipitated and washed several times with distilled water until free of nitrate ions. The resulting green gel was centrifuged and then dispersed in 100 mL milli-Q water to obtain Ni(OH)2 sol. For single-molecule fluorescence experiments, the NiO films were prepared by spin coating Ni(OH)2 sol onto cleaned cover glasses at 2000 rpm for 10 s and 3000 rpm for 50 s and were annealed at 500 °C for 1 h. The cover glasses were purchased from Matsunami Glass and cleaned by sonication in a 20% detergent solution (As One, Cleanace), followed by repeated washings with warm running water. Finally, the cover glasses were washed again with Milli-Q ultrapure water (Millipore). The preparation procedures of the samples for steady-state absorption and fluorescence, transient absorption, and photoelectrochemical measurements are given in the Electronic Supplementary Information (ESI).†
Preparation of Al2O3/NiO film

          Al2O3/NiO films for single-molecule fluorescence experiments were prepared according to the procedures reported in the literature.52,53 Briefly, NiO films were dipped into a solution of 0.15 M aluminum tri-sec-butoxide (99.9%, from Aldrich) in isopropanol at 50–60 °C for 15 min. The films were washed with isopropanol three times, hydrolyzed in water, and then annealed at 450 °C in air for 60 min.

Sample preparation for single-molecule fluorescence experiments
Single-molecule samples were prepared by spin coating an aqueous solution of WS-PDI (1 nM, 40 μL) onto the surface of the film samples at 2000 rpm for 10 s and 3000 rpm for 50 s. The film samples were mounted on the bottom of a stainless steel holder designed for viewing specimens on the microscope.54,55 A cleaned cover glass was placed on the film using a 0.5 mm thick Teflon spacer to form a chamber with an internal volume of about 150 μL. An Ar-saturated acetonitrile was then introduced into this chamber in an Ar-purged glove box ([O2] < 0.5 vol%) and a cap with an O-ring seal was tightly screwed on to prevent the solution from escaping. The oxygen concentration was measured by an oxygen analyzer, maxO2+ (Maxtec, Inc.).
Ensemble-averaged spectral measurements
Steady-state UV-visible absorption spectra were measured using UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3100). Steady-state fluorescence spectra were measured using a HORIBA FluoroMax-4 fluorescence spectrophotometer. All experimental data were obtained at room temperature.
Femtosecond transient absorption measurements
The femtosecond transient absorption spectra were measured by the pump and probe method using a regeneratively amplified titanium sapphire laser (Spectra-Physics, Spitfire Pro F, 1 kHz) pumped by a Nd:YLF laser (Spectra-Physics, Empower 15).56 The seed pulse was generated by a titanium sapphire laser (Spectra-Physics, Tsunami 3941-M1BB; 80 fs FWHM) pumped with a diode-pumped solid state laser (Spectra-Physics, Millennia VIIIs). An optical parametric amplifier (Spectra Physics, OPA-800CF-1) was used to produce the excitation pulse (560 nm). The excitation light was depolarized. A white light continuum pulse, which was generated by focusing the residual of the fundamental light on a sapphire crystal after the computer-controlled optical delay, was divided into two parts and used as the probe and the reference lights, of which the latter was used to compensate the laser fluctuation. Both the probe and reference lights were directed to the rotating sample cell and detected by the CCD detector equipped with the polychromator (Solar, MS3504). All measurements were carried out at room temperature. The non-linear least-squares fitting procedures of the kinetic data were performed in OriginPro 8.5 using the Levenberg-Marquardt iteration method. All the experimental data were obtained at room temperature.
Nanosecond transient absorption measurements
The measurements were performed using the second harmonic generation (532 nm, 5.0 mJ/pulse, 5 ns FWHM) from a Q-switched Nd3+: YAG laser (Continuum, Surelite II-10) for the excitation operated with temporal control by a delay generator (Stanford Research Systems, DG535).57 The analyzing light from a 450 W Xe arc lamp (Ushio, UXL-451-0) was directed through a grating monochromator (Nikon, G250) to a silicon avalanche photodiode detector (Hamamatsu Photonics, S5343). The transient signals were recorded by a digitizer (Tektronix, TDS 580D). All experiments were carried out at room temperature.
Single-molecule fluorescence measurements
Single-molecule fluorescence intensity trajectories and images were recorded using an objective-scanning confocal microscope system (PicoQuant, MicroTime 200) coupled with an Olympus IX71 inverted fluorescence microscope.54,55 The samples were excited through an oil-immersion objective lens (Olympus, UAPON 150XOTIRF; 1.45 NA, 150×) using a 485 nm pulsed laser (PicoQuant, LDH-D-C-485, 2.5 μW) controlled by a PDL-800B driver (PicoQuant). The emission from the sample was collected using the same objective and detected by a single photon avalanche photodiode (Micro Photon Devices, PDM 50CT) through a dichroic beam splitter (Chroma, Z405/488rpc-xt), longpass filter (Chroma, HQ510LP), and 75 μm pinhole for spatial filtering to reject out-of-focus signals. The data collected using the PicoHarp 300 TCSPC module (PicoQuant) were stored in the time-tagged time-resolved mode (TTTR), recording every detected photon with its individual timing, which were used for the single-molecule analysis. The instrument response function (IRF) of our fluorescence detection system was ∼110 ps. For the spectroscopy, only the emission that passed through a slit entered the imaging spectrograph (ActonResearch, SP-2356) that was equipped with an EM-CCD camera (Princeton Instruments, ProEM). The spectra were typically integrated for 5 s. The spectrum detected by the EM-CCD camera was stored and analyzed by using a personal computer. The detailed experimental setup for wide-field single-molecule fluorescence measurements based on a total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) was described in our previous paper.58 All the experimental data were obtained at room temperature.
Photocurrent measurements
Amperometric i-t curve and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) experiments were carried out at room temperature using an electrochemical analyzer (ALS, model 660A). Photocurrent data were measured using a Xe light source (Asahi Spectra, LAX-C100) through an air mass (AM) filter or a bandpass filter.
Results and discussion
Nanocrystalline NiO films were prepared by heating Ni(OH)2 precursor sols coated on cleaned cover glasses.45,59 Using an atomic force microscope (AFM), we found that the synthesized film is a uniform layer (Fig. S1†). The image indicated that the thickness of the film used for single-molecule experiments is approximately 60 nm and the primary particle size is approximately 13 nm. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the nanoparticles showed that the film consists of pure NiO nanocrystals (Fig. S2†). The NiO crystallite size was estimated as 14 nm from the Scherrer equation, consistent with the AFM observation. NiO is a typical p-type semiconductor with a wide bandgap (Egap = 3.55 eV), and its valance band (VB) potential (EVB) is estimated to be +0.4 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) (pH 6.8).24,59 For DSSC applications, the dye sensitizers can inject holes into the VB of NiO. Fig. 1 shows the scheme of hole transfer from the electronically excited WS-PDI (1WS-PDI*) to the NiO film. Calculations showed that the S1 energy state of WS-PDI is approximately 2.1 eV (ES1 is determined from average wavenumbers of the normalized peaks of the first absorption and emission maxima) and that the one-electron reduction potential (Ered) of WS-PDI in acetonitrile is −0.27 V versus the NHE (Fig. S3†). From the excited-state energy and redox data, we estimated a free energy change (ΔGHT) of −1.4 eV for hole transfer from 1WS-PDI* to the NiO VB, thus suggesting that hole transfer from the photoexcited WS-PDI to NiO is thermodynamically possible.
The spectral features of WS-PDI molecules adsorbed on different substrates were addressed by performing steady-state absorption and fluorescence measurements. Fig. 2 shows the absorption and fluorescence spectra of WS-PDI on (a) glass, (b) Al2O3/NiO, and (c) NiO surfaces. For as-prerpared NiO films, a broad absorption was observed in the visible region (dashed line in Fig. 2). This is because, during the heat treatment in air, part of the Ni2+ atoms on the surface of the NiO film are oxidized to Ni3+, which gives rise to a brown coloration.59 After NiO background subtraction, it is easily seen that the absorption spectrum of WS-PDI molecules adsorbed on NiO is blue-shifted by several nanometres compared with those of WS-PDI on glass or Al2O3/NiO. Fluorescence spectra show a peak shift from a maximum at 620 nm for WS-PDI adsorbed on glass to a maximum at 585 nm for WS-PDI adsorbed on NiO.60 According to the fact that the aggregation of WS-PDI molecules causes a red shift in the absorption and fluorescence peak,61 we attribute the observed spectral shifts to strong electronic interaction between the ground-state WS-PDI and NiO VB or surface states. These peak shifts have been observed for other dye molecules on semiconductors42,62,63 and interpreted as an indication of the formation of a new charge-transfer state because of the electronic coupling between a hole (electron) donor and acceptor via chelation. Further evidence also supports this interpretation. After the NiO surface is covered by one thin Al2O3 layer, the fluorescence peak of WS-PDI broadens and shifts to 610 nm, which is between 585 nm and 620 nm. Because of the insulating Al2O3 layer between WS-PDI and NiO, the interaction between NiO and WS-PDI can be reduced. However, this effect is undoubtedly inhomogeneous at the nanoscale, and it is likely that three interactions—no interaction (peak at 620 nm), weak interaction, and strong interaction (peak at 585 nm)—overlap each other, resulting in the broad fluorescence band with the peak at 610 nm. Since the absorbances of three samples at the excitation wavelength of 540 nm are almost the same, one can estimate the quenching efficiency from the fluorescence peak area. When compared with the glass sample, the quenching efficiencies were calculated to be 13% and 60% for the Al2O3/NiO and NiO samples, respectively.
 Fig. 2  Absorption (fine lines) and fluorescence spectra (bold lines) observed for WS-PDI coated on the glass (a), Al2O3/NiO (b), and NiO (c) surfaces. The background spectra of the substrates were subtracted from the absorption spectra of the samples. The dashed line shows the absorption spectrum of the NiO film. 
To get a deeper insight into the fundamental interfacial hole transfer mechanisms, we performed femtosecond transient absorption measurements. Fig. 3a shows the transient absorption spectra of the WS-PDI/NiO sample at different delay times. The depletion below 620 nm appeared immediately after the laser pulse, reflecting the ground-state bleaching dynamics. In the spectra, one new absorption peak (700 nm) overlapping another broad absorption band was observed; this suggests that two new transient species are formed during laser flash photolysis. From our control measurements, the transient absorption spectrum of excited WS-PDI molecules in a buffer solution only showed one absorption peak at 700 nm (Fig. S5†). It was also confirmed that the radical anion state of WS-PDI (WS-PDI˙−) has a maximum peak at around 790 nm during pulse radiolysis of the WS-PDI aqueous solution (Fig. S6†). Therefore, based on our femtosecond experiments on the WS-PDI/NiO system, we assign the observed transient absorption peak at 700 nm to 1WS-PDI* and mainly assign the absorption band at wavelengths over 750 nm to WS-PDI˙− (Fig. S7†).64
 Fig. 3  (a) Femtosecond transient absorption spectra of WS-PDI-adsorbed NiO nanoparticle film in Ar-saturated acetonitrile recorded at indicated delay times following 554 nm laser excitation (6.3 mJ pulse−1). At early delay times, the transient spectra consist of the bleaching of ground-state absorption (575 nm) and the excited state absorption (700 nm). The decay of the excited state should lead to the formation of WS-PDI˙− (>750 nm) and long-lived ground-state bleaching, indicating the presence of hole transfer. Transient traces for (b) 1WS-PDI* absorption at 700 nm, (c) WS-PDI˙− absorption at 770 nm, and (d) ground-state bleaching at 575 nm. Note that the absorption peak of WS-PDI˙− appeared as 770 nm because the range of 770–830 nm cannot be measured due to the residual 800 nm light. 

Fig. 3b, c show the transient traces within short and long delay-time windows, probed at 700 nm and 770 nm of 1WS-PDI* and WS-PDI˙−, respectively. Charge separation and recombination processes could be experimentally observed, and their rates were derived from transient absorption signal traces, i.e., by the ground-state absorption bleaching recovery of the dye or by the decay of transient absorption from the excited and intermediate charge-separated states.
The formation process of WS-PDI˙− can be understood from the rise at 770 nm and the decay at 700 nm. The rise component at 770 nm, with a very short time (time constant of less than 1.0 ps), is attributed to the fast hole injection process. Two decay components at 700 nm are attributable to the slow charge transfer process with time constants of 4 ± 1 ps (60%) and 450 ± 50 ps (40%). Specifically, we attribute the ultrafast component (<1.0 ps) to strong electronic coupling for WS-PDI molecules adsorbed on the NiO surface, resulting in the fast charge transfer process. The other two large time constants (4 and 450 ps) are attributed to weakly coupled dye molecules that would cause the charge transfer process to be slow. At the same time, the ground-state bleaching recovery probed at 575 nm and the decay components at 770 nm are associated with the charge recombination process (Fig. 3d). The transient trace at 575 nm was fitted with a double exponential function, and decay time constants of 3 ± 1 ps (65%) and 490 ± 50 ps (35%) were obtained. In the same manner, two decay time components with 12 ± 2 ps (53%) and 560 ± 50 ps (47%) were determined at 770 nm. Based on the error of fitting, it is apparent that the fast 3 ps component is attributable to the charge recombination process for the strongly coupled condition, whereas the 12 ps and 490 ps or 560 ps components indicate the slow back charge transfer.
In addition to the picosecond time decay components, species with much longer lifetimes were detected by nanosecond transient absorption measurements (532 nm laser flash photolysis of the WS-PDI/NiO sample in an Ar-saturated acetonitrile solution). As shown in Fig. S8a†, an absorption band with a peak at around 790 nm, which is assigned to the WS-PDI˙−, was clearly observable after the laser flash. The decay profiles were well fitted by a double exponential function with time constants of 3 ± 1 μs (48%) and 74 ± 4 μs (52%) (Fig. S8b† and Table S1†). This is because the injected holes are presumably trapped on the NiO surface, diffuse via non-Brownian motion in the NiO nanoparticles, and then recombine with WS-PDI˙− on the surface in the same way as the dye/TiO2 systems.8 During the charge transfer process, the Ni2+ at the surface of the NiO nanoparticles are easily oxidized to Ni3+ which is the typical hole trapping process. This process was proved by the electrochemical experiments.59 The charge recombination process would take tens of picoseconds to microseconds, or up to milliseconds, considering the detection limit of our experiments. The ratio of the long-lived charge-separated species (>ns lifetime) to the total amount of photogenerated charge-separated species is about 3%, which can be estimated from the initial absorption of WS-PDI˙− in femtosecond and nanosecond transient absorption measurements.
From the decay profiles of the WS-PDI/Al2O3/NiO sample, two time constants of 6 ± 1 μs (42%) and 200 ± 6 μs (58%) were well fitted by a double exponential function. These time constants are longer than those for the WS-PDI/NiO system, thus suggesting that the back hole transfer is retarded. After increasing the Al2O3 layer thickness, the signal of WS-PDI˙− was not found; this indicates that the hole injection is largely blocked. These results clearly show that (1) there are at least two different adsorption patterns of WS-PDI molecules on NiO having strong (weak) coupling, resulting in fast (slow) charge transfer and that (2) the insulating Al2O3 layer decreases the electronic interaction between WS-PDI and NiO, and thus increases the proportion of weakly coupled species.
To investigate two or more different adsorption patterns of WS-PDI molecules, single-molecule fluorescence experiments are very useful. Typical fluorescence images show spatially isolated, single WS-PDI molecules adsorbed on the particle surfaces in Ar-saturated acetonitrile (Fig. 4a, c, and e). The average fluorescence intensities on the trajectory are approximately 3 counts per millisecond (cpms) for the WS-PDI/NiO sample, approximately 7 cpms for the WS-PDI/Al2O3/NiO sample, and approximately 10 cpms for the WS-PDI/Al2O3 sample (Fig. 4b, d, and f). Furthermore, photoblinking events in the fluorescence trajectories were observed for all of the WS-PDI molecules examined on the NiO and Al2O3/NiO surfaces, as discussed later.
 Fig. 4  Single-molecule fluorescence images (a, c, e) and intensity trajectories (b, d, f) of WS-PDI on the NiO (a, b), Al2O3/NiO (c, d), and Al2O3 (e, f) surfaces in Ar-saturated acetonitrile. Images and intensity trajectories were obtained using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) and time-resolved confocal microscopy, respectively. The binning time is 10 ms. Histograms of the emission intensity are given to determine the threshold for dark “off state” and bright “on state”. 
Fluorescence lifetime distribution demonstrates the inhomogeneous interfacial charge transfer rate and is consistent with the attribution of hole transfer reactivity fluctuation dynamics, which is only revealed by single-molecule experiments.39–41,44Fig. 5a shows three typical single-molecule fluorescence decay curves of WS-PDI on the NiO, Al2O3/NiO, and Al2O3 surfaces. The fluorescence decays were fitted to a single exponential function, and the determined time constants were 2.0 ns on the NiO surface, 3.0 ns on Al2O3/NiO, and 4.9 ns on Al2O3. The lifetime of free WS-PDI molecules was obtained as 4.6 ns from the fluorescence decay profile of WS-PDI (1 nM) in Ar-saturated acetonitrile (Fig. S9†). Because the reported dielectric constant of Al2O3 (ε = 9.0) is similar to that of NiO (ε = 9.7),65 the effects of the dielectric constant on the fluorescence lifetime of WS-PDI molecules on these surfaces are similar.44 When considering that there is very poor spectral overlap between the fluorescence from the excited dye and the absorption of NiO, the possibility of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is excluded. Therefore, we speculate that the observed fluorescence quenching in the nanosecond time domain also originates from the electronic interplay between WS-PDI and NiO.

(e) The dependence of ln<kq> on the number (n) of the Al2O3 layers. See the text for details. 
Because of the inhomogeneous nature of the interactions, the lifetime differs from molecule to molecule and is expected to be widely distributed, which has also been demonstrated in previous publications on similar dye-sensitized charge transfer systems.40,44Fig. 5b, c, and d show the single-molecule fluorescence lifetime distributions of single WS-PDI molecules on the NiO, Al2O3/NiO, and Al2O3 surfaces, respectively. The lifetimes of WS-PDI on the NiO surface and WS-PDI on the Al2O3 surface show a narrow distribution maximum around 2.0 ns with a 0.45 ns FWHM and around 4.9 ns with a 0.45 ns FWHM, respectively. In contrast, for WS-PDI on the Al2O3/NiO surface, a wide distribution of the fluorescence lifetime was obtained, ranging from ∼1.0 ns to 5.0 ns. It is noteworthy that three peaks were observed at 2.2 ns, 3.0 ns, and 4.0 ns. It is possible that the Al2O3 coating on the NiO surface is not homogenous, resulting in the formation of three regions: a bare NiO surface, an Al2O3/NiO surface with thin Al2O3 layers, and an Al2O3/NiO surface with thick Al2O3 layers. Presumably, the above-mentioned lifetimes correspond to the three regions, i.e., 2.2 ns corresponds to the bare NiO surface, 3.0 ns corresponds to the thin Al2O3/NiO surface, and 4.0 ns corresponds to the thick Al2O3/NiO surface. The single-molecule fluorescence lifetime distribution of WS-PDI on a double-layer Al2O3/NiO surface was also examined. The distribution of fluorescence lifetime is mainly divided at two points (Fig. S10†), one at 4.3 ns and another at 5.1 ns.
Here, the average fluorescence quenching rate constants (<kq>) are calculated using the equation56 (1) where n is the number of Al2O3 layers, <τfl> is the average fluorescence lifetime of WS-PDI on NiO (n = 0) and Al2O3/NiO (n = 1–2, i.e., Al2O3/NiO-1 and Al2O3/NiO-2), and <τfl0> is the average fluorescence lifetime of WS-PDI on Al2O3 (4.9 ns). For electron tunneling through insulating spacers,52 the n dependence of <kq> is given by <kq(n)> = <kq(n = 0)>exp(− β·n)(2)where β is the exponential decay constant. The β for a single layer was determined to be 0.9 from a good linear relationship between ln<kq> and n (R2 = 0.99), as shown in Fig. 5e. Based on the thickness of a single Al2O3 layer (1–2 Å),66,67 this β value corresponds to 0.5–1.0 Å−1, which is close to those reported for Al2O3 layers in the ruthenium and rhenium bipyridyl complexes/Al2O3/TiO2 systems (0.8 Å−1)52 and in the ruthenium dye (N719)/Al2O3/SnO2 systems (1 Å−1),66 and typical insulating alkyl spacers (0.6–1.0 Å−1).68 Therefore, the above results imply that (1) the lifetime and interaction are related to each other with the strong interaction causing the fluorescence lifetime of the molecule to be small, and vice versa and that (2) the insulating layer of Al2O3 can reduce electronic interaction between the dye molecule and NiO, leading to a decrease in hole transfer rates. Thus, it is very clear that strong and weak couplings coexist between WS-PDI and NiO in this system.
From the Al2O3 thickness dependence of kq, it was found that the single-molecule fluorescence quenching event occurs within 1 nm reaction distance. Therefore, we can again exclude the energy transfer between the excited dye and NiO, because the impact of distance for energy transfer is over a few nanometres.69 On the other hand, the impact of distance for charge transfer is less than 1 nm.52 Although no rise component attributed to the formation of the radical anion was observed by transient absorption measurements, we believe that the single-molecule fluorescence quenching is mainly due to the hole transfer from the excited dye molecules to the NiO acceptor states, possibly surface defects. Since the overall injection dynamics are highly multiexponential, the estimated kq values likely represent the lower limit of the hole-transfer rate constant.
We performed single-molecule polarization anisotropy experiments for individual WS-PDI molecules on the particle surface to confirm whether the temporal change of charge transfer dynamics was due to molecular motion in the solution environment. The fluorescence intensity trajectories were obtained for single WS-PDI molecules adsorbed on NiO from two different directions, one vertical (V) and the other horizontal (H) to the in-plane x-axis of the optics under irradiation with a circular-polarized laser. Most of the WS-PDI molecules (>80%) in both directions exhibit correlated intensity changes and similar lifetimes within a 10% error limit (Fig. 6a). The results imply that WS-PDI molecules are well fixed on the NiO surface in acetonitrile. However, some WS-PDI molecules show signs of reorientation and reactivity fluctuation, which are directly confirmed from the anti-correlated fluorescence changes in the V and H directions (see the arrows) and the temporal lifetime changes, respectively (Fig. 6b). These phenomena are more significant (>60%) for WS-PDI molecules on the Al2O3/NiO surface, possibly because WS-PDI molecules more easily rotate on the Al2O3 surface than on NiO.70 Hofkens and co-workers showed that PDI derivatives have spectral shifts and lifetime changes due to twisting around the long axis of the chromophore.71 A similar spectral shift was observed for single WS-PDI molecules on a glass surface in an air atmosphere.43 However, as shown in Fig. S11†, more than 85% of WS-PDI molecules on the thick Al2O3 layer on the NiO surface (the Al2O3 coating procedure was repeated two times), as well as on the pure Al2O3 surface, have a very stable fluorescence intensity and lifetime. We further tested the relationship between the number of luminescent spots, which approximately corresponds to the number of adsorbed molecules, and WS-PDI concentration on different sample surfaces (Fig. S12†). It was found that the number of WS-PDI molecules adsorbed on the Al2O3/NiO surface significantly decreases after washing with acetonitrile, when compared with that on the NiO surface. This observation can be readily explained by the interpretation that the binding strength between WS-PDI and NiO is stronger than that between WS-PDI and Al2O3. The increased rotational mobility of the molecules because of the Al2O3 layer coating on the surface is also consistent with our interpretation. Thus, we conclude that the observed lifetime fluctuation is mainly attributed to the temporal change of the electronic coupling strength between WS-PDI and NiO responsible for hole transfer, which is closely related to molecular conformation and orientation.
 Fig. 6  Single-molecule fluorescence polarization profiles for WS-PDI molecules adsorbed on the NiO surface in Ar-saturated acetonitrile. The trajectories of fluorescence intensity are obtained for single WS-PDI molecules adsorbed on NiO from vertical (V) and horizontal (H) directions. The traces “H + V” were calculated from both vertical and horizontal components. The traces are displaced vertically for clarity. The lifetimes shown in the upper panels are derived every 2 s. Panels a and b show typical examples of stationary and rotating molecules, respectively. 
When WS-PDI molecules are dispersed on the different surfaces, the blinking behavior of single dye molecules undergoes tremendous variation (Fig. 4b, d, and f). Here, we defined the fluorescence intensity above the threshold level, which was chosen to be 1 cpms (see blue lines), as the “on state” and below the threshold level as the “off state”. We found that the number of on-off blinking events for single molecule WS-PDI decreases when WS-PDI molecules disperse on the Al2O3/NiO surface (Fig. 4d). Even WS-PDI on Al2O3 shows no blinking and has a relatively stable fluorescence emission (Fig. 4f). Based on the above lifetime data, statistical analysis of on and off time distributions should focus on the 3.0 ns lifetime component for Al2O3/NiO-1 (thin Al2O3 layer) and the 4.0 ns lifetime component for Al2O3/NiO-2 (thick Al2O3 layer).
The durations of on and off times were carefully counted, and their histograms were tentatively fitted with single-exponential curves to determine the average lifetimes of on and off states (Fig. S13†). As summarized in Table 1, the determined average on times are 18 ± 2, 48 ± 2, and 113 ± 9 ms for many single WS-PDI molecules on NiO, Al2O3/NiO-1, and Al2O3/NiO-2 surfaces, respectively, whereas the determined average off times are 14 ± 2, 21 ± 1, and 47 ± 3 ms on NiO, Al2O3/NiO-1, and Al2O3/NiO-2 surfaces, respectively. In fluorescence trajectories, the “on state” corresponds to the emission from the excited WS-PDI with the slow hole transfer to NiO or without the hole transfer, whereas the transition to “off state” corresponds to the fast hole transfer process between the WS-PDI and NiO.72 It should be noted that both the average on and off times increases simultaneously after an insulating layer of Al2O3 is introduced in the WS-PDI and NiO system.

According to the literature,40,73–76 power law distributions indicate the existence of a wide distribution of on and off state lifetimes. The probability density, P(t), is analyzed by weighting each point in the on/off histograms by the average time (Δtav) between nearest neighbor event bins using the following equation (3)where Ni(t) and Ntotal are the number of on or off events with duration time of t and the total number of on or off events, respectively. As is well-known, the time distributions of the on- and off-events follow a simple power law behavior as given by Pi(t) = At−mi(i = on or off),(4)where A is the scaling coefficient and m is the power-law exponent that describes the distribution.56,57
As shown in Fig. 7 and summarized in Table 1, the distributions exhibit a simple power law fit and the power-law exponents (mon/off) for on/off times clearly decrease because of Al2O3 layer coatings. The power-law behaviors have been extensively investigated in blinking dynamics of single QDs and single organic dye molecules.40,73 According to the literature,40,57 the power law distributions indicate the existence of a wide distribution of on and off state lifetimes. Here, the distributions exhibit a simple power law fits. Therefore, from the decrease of the power-law exponents, this suggests that the charge transfer processes are blocked by the Al2O3 layer. However, the off time distribution for WS-PDI on the Al2O3/NiO-2 surface indicates a considerable departure from the power-law dependence (Fig. 7f). Durrant et al. reported that overlayer coatings of Al2O3 on TiO2 results in less dispersive (i.e., more exponential) recombination kinetics for ruthenium bipyridyl dye, rather than more stretched kinetics.53,77 They explained that the observed reduction in the dispersion of the kinetics is attributable to a shift from electron transport in the TiO2 film to interface-limited recombination dynamics. Our single-molecule data are also indicative of the gradual transition from the trapping/detrapping-limited hole transfer kinetics to the interface-limited kinetics by coating Al2O3 layers on the surface of NiO nanoparticles.
 Fig. 7  Power law distributions of on and off times obtained for many single WS-PDI molecules on the NiO, Al2O3/NiO-1, and Al2O3/NiO-2 surfaces. Solid lines indicate the best fits based on the simple power law. The dashed line in panel f indicates a single-exponential fitting. The analyzed total numbers of on or off events are over 2500 events. 
On the basis of the above results, we propose a reasonable mechanism for charge transfer processes between WS-PDI and NiO (Fig. 8). WS-PDI⋯NiO and 1WS-PDI*⋯NiO represent the ground state and the excited state, respectively, for the coupled WS-PDI/NiO system. In the strongly coupled system, the small amount of negative (δ-) and positive (δ+) charge densities would be partially localized on WS-PDI and NiO, respectively, to form the charge-transfer complex. Upon photoexcitation of the complex, the ultrafast hole transfer reaction occurs and the resulting charge-separated states undergo a fast charge recombination process (fs ∼ ps, “off state”, reactions 1, 4 and 6 in Fig. 8). Thereby, fluorescence emission from the WS-PDI molecules is completely quenched. In the design of efficient systems, fast hole injection combined with a very slow back charge recombination process is necessary. It is known that the fast charge recombination reaction in the p-type NiO-based DSSCs is one of the main factors for their low photoelectric conversion efficiency.21 Although the hole injection is very fast in the strongly coupled system, however, the lifetime of the charge-separated state is very short. This adversely affects the efficiency improvements in the DSSC system. In the weakly coupled system, the hole injection is still very short (ps ∼ ns, reaction 5) relative to other radiative and nonradiative deactivation pathways, and the charge recombination takes tens of picoseconds to microseconds, or up to milliseconds (ps ∼ ms, “off state”, reactions 2, 5 and 6). This is because after hole injection, the injected holes presumably migrate via trapping and detrapping processes in the NiO nanoparticle film and then recombine with WS-PDI˙− on the surface. However, because of the weak interaction, charge injection is intermittently interrupted and the excited WS-PDI molecules return to the ground state by fluorescence emitting (“on state”, reactions 2 and 3), which is a disadvantage to the overall efficiency of the device. The controlled Al2O3 layer can effectively weaken the electronic interaction between WS-PDI and NiO, and this can result in a number of weakly coupled species being formed. Meanwhile, thick Al2O3 layers block the hole injection and produce the molecules in the “on state” under photodynamic equilibrium.48 Thus, the introduction of insulating layers has contradictory effects between the formation of weakly coupled species and the “on state”.
 Fig. 8  Proposed mechanism of charge transfer (CT) and charge recombination (CR) processes between WS-PDI and NiO. 
To prove our theory, photoelectrochemical measurements were performed. Fig. 9a shows the typical incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectrum of WS-PDI-sensitized NiO electrochemical cells measured under monochromatic light. The shape of the IPCE spectrum closely matches the optical absorption of the WS-PDI, confirming that the observed photocurrents are dye-sensitized. As expected, the Al2O3/NiO sample (single layer coating) produced approximately 21% higher photoelectric conversion efficiency than the NiO sample under one-sun conditions (100 mW cm−2) (Table 2 and Fig. S14†). Blank experiments using ITO electrodes coated with only WS-PDI or NiO exhibited negligibly small photocurrent generation under similar experimental conditions. Thus, the photocurrent and photovoltage responses of the electrodes further highlight the critical role of the Al2O3 overlayer on NiO (Fig. 9b).29 However, when the coating procedure was repeated several times, the photocurrent became weak. The thick Al2O3 layer significantly blocked hole injection, resulting in no photocurrent. Meanwhile, the thin layer of Al2O3 created more weak interaction species in the system, which is very important for the highly efficient optoelectronic devices. The use of devices properly engineered by atomic-scale fabrication methods such as atomic layer deposition66,78 will allow us to achieve the appropriate thickness of the Al2O3 layer.

Conclusions
In summary, we have investigated the interfacial charge transfer processes of fluorescent WS-PDI molecules on NiO nanoparticle film by combined measurements of transient absorption and single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopies. Based on the kinetic analysis of the formation and decay of WS-PDI˙− as well as the spectral features of the ground-state and excited species, several types of molecular interactions are demonstrated to coexist in the systems and drive the charge transfer dynamics. The single-molecule experiments directly revealed the heterogeneities in the molecular interactions and dynamics and the temporal fluctuation in the charge transfer processes of individual WS-PDI molecules on the NiO surface. Evidence for this is obtained from statistical analyses of single-molecule fluorescence lifetime, anisotropy, and blinking. The influences of the Al2O3 insulating layer are also studied. A controlled thickness of the Al2O3 layer is found to decrease the electronic interaction between WS-PDI molecules and NiO, resulting in preferable charge transfer kinetics. Moreover, we demonstrated that the weak electronic coupling facilitated by a very thin layer of insulating Al2O3 is desirable for promoting the efficiency of photoelectric conversion. Recent studies have also highlighted the importance of a suitable interaction between organic molecules and semiconductors on the overall efficiency of photocatalytic oxidation and hydrogen production.79,80 Consequently, our findings provide further insight into the mechanism of interfacial charge transfer reactions at molecule/semiconductor interfaces and potentially contribute to bringing about improvements in the performance of p-type DSSCs as well as other optoelectronic devices and photocatalysts.

We performed single-molecule fluorescence spectral measurements to confirm the molecular interaction between WS-PDI and NiO (Fig. S4, Supporting Information). The spectra exhibited emission at around 585 nm and are accorded to the ensemble-averaged fluorescence spectra, thus suggesting that the observed spectral shift is not due to the aggregation of WS-PDI molecules on the surface. Because the interaction between them is different from molecule to molecule, the single-molecule fluorescence peaks have a distribution.

One might expect that an absorption band of injected holes in NiO appears in the visible region after hole transfer. However, the molar absorption coefficient of Ni3+ species (ε ∼ 103 M−1 cm−1)59 is much smaller than those (ε ∼ 104 M−1 cm−1) of WS-PDI and WS-PDI˙− (Fig. S6†).51 Thus, it is very difficult to observe the tansient absorption of the NiO holes and analyze their dynamics. In addition, no detectable transient signal was obseved in the present wavelength range during the laser flash photolysis of the NiO2 film.

Based on the single-molecule tracking analysis using TIRFM, it was found that WS-PDI molecules cannot diffuse on the particle surface over 20 nm, which is our spatial resolution, during observation period of 60 s.

According to the literature,48 the triplet state lifetime of WS-PDI is less than 0.1 ms. Therefore, the observed off state is not attributed to the triplet state.

 	Fig. 1  Mechanistic scheme for hole injection from electronically excited dye to NiO nanoparticle. S0 and S1 are the grand and singlet excited states of the dye, respectively. CB is the conduction band and VB is the valence band. An Al2O3 overlayer on the NiO surface is also shown.	 

 	Fig. 2  Absorption (fine lines) and fluorescence spectra (bold lines) observed for WS-PDI coated on the glass (a), Al2O3/NiO (b), and NiO (c) surfaces. The background spectra of the substrates were subtracted from the absorption spectra of the samples. The dashed line shows the absorption spectrum of the NiO film.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Femtosecond transient absorption spectra of WS-PDI-adsorbed NiO nanoparticle film in Ar-saturated acetonitrile recorded at indicated delay times following 554 nm laser excitation (6.3 mJ pulse−1). At early delay times, the transient spectra consist of the bleaching of ground-state absorption (575 nm) and the excited state absorption (700 nm). The decay of the excited state should lead to the formation of WS-PDI˙− (>750 nm) and long-lived ground-state bleaching, indicating the presence of hole transfer. Transient traces for (b) 1WS-PDI* absorption at 700 nm, (c) WS-PDI˙− absorption at 770 nm, and (d) ground-state bleaching at 575 nm. Note that the absorption peak of WS-PDI˙− appeared as 770 nm because the range of 770–830 nm cannot be measured due to the residual 800 nm light.	 

 	Fig. 4  Single-molecule fluorescence images (a, c, e) and intensity trajectories (b, d, f) of WS-PDI on the NiO (a, b), Al2O3/NiO (c, d), and Al2O3 (e, f) surfaces in Ar-saturated acetonitrile. Images and intensity trajectories were obtained using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) and time-resolved confocal microscopy, respectively. The binning time is 10 ms. Histograms of the emission intensity are given to determine the threshold for dark “off state” and bright “on state”.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Single-molecule fluorescence decay profiles of WS-PDI on the NiO surface. Histograms of the fluorescence lifetime obtained for individual WS-PDI molecules adsorbed on the NiO (b), Al2O3/NiO (c), and Al2O3 (d) surfaces in Ar-saturated acetonitrile. (e) The dependence of ln<kq> on the number (n) of the Al2O3 layers. See the text for details.

 	Fig. 6  Single-molecule fluorescence polarization profiles for WS-PDI molecules adsorbed on the NiO surface in Ar-saturated acetonitrile. The trajectories of fluorescence intensity are obtained for single WS-PDI molecules adsorbed on NiO from vertical (V) and horizontal (H) directions. The traces “H + V” were calculated from both vertical and horizontal components. The traces are displaced vertically for clarity. The lifetimes shown in the upper panels are derived every 2 s. Panels a and b show typical examples of stationary and rotating molecules, respectively.
