    , Accepted 14th January 2014First published on 14th January 2014AbstractIn this work, [110] oriented ZnO nanosheet (ZnONS) array films with a large percentage of high-energy {0001} surfaces were prepared for the first time with the assistance of sodium citrate. ZnONS array films possess prominent UV–visible absorption with an absorption edge at ~405 nm, indicating that the optical property of the semiconductor is dependent on a specific crystal structure and crystal plane. CdS and CdSe quantum dots (QDs) were assembled onto ZnONS array films to form a cascade structure of ZnONS/CdS/CdSe by the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method. The as-fabricated photoanode exhibits strong absorption in the visible spectrum up to 735 nm. With light illumination, the optimum photoanode yields a photocurrent of ~4.40 mA cm−2 at 0 V versus SCE, which is about 4.6 times of that of pure ZnONS samples. The excellent photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties of our photoanodes suggest that the QDs sensitized ZnONS array films with a large percentage of high-energy surfaces have potential applications in PEC solar cells.
1. Introduction
Zinc oxide (ZnO) is an important n-type semiconductor, which has a wide band gap of 3.37 eV and a large exciton binding energy of 60 meV at room temperature.1 Due to its appropriate energy band position, significantly high electron mobility, thermal and chemical stability in solution, ZnO has attracted extensive attention as a promising candidate for applications in photocatalysis, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) etc.2–4 However, the large band gap limits its absorption to no more than ultraviolet region which corresponds to only about 3–5% of the solar spectrum. Many kinds of narrow band gap inorganic semiconductors, such as CdS, PbS, CdSe, and InP, have been explored to serve as quantum dots (QDs) sensitizers in QDSCs.5–8 Among all the photosensitizers, CdS and CdSe are semiconductors with direct band gaps of 2.42 eV and 1.70 eV respectively, which means CdS and CdSe can trigger a wider light absorption range compared to ZnO.9,10 In order to accelerate charge separation and transfer between two semiconductors, interfacial electronic energy alignment should be taken into account.11 It is known that CdS and CdSe have higher conduction band edges (lower valence band edges) with respect to that of ZnO. The appropriate type-II structure can impel photoelectron injection from the QDs into ZnO and holes to the opposite direction before recombination occurs.10–12 Based on the above understanding, we propose that the CdS/CdSe co-modified ZnO nanosheet array films with CdS as an underlayer and CdSe as an outer layer should be a promising photoanode for its wide absorption spectrum, high electron injection efficiency and fast electron transference. The method of successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) turns out to be an effective approach for QDs deposition.13 Size distribution of deposited QDs can be controlled by different cycles. Their nucleation and in situ growth mechanism can form a larger heterojunction area.
One-dimensional (1D) ZnO nanostructure arrays, such as nanorods and nanotubes, have been widely utilized in QDSCs to significantly enhance the electron transport velocity within the photoanode by providing a direct conduction pathway for the photogenerated electrons.9,14 However, insufficient surface area of these 1D nanostructure arrays limits the power conversion efficiency at a relatively low level, owing to deficient sensitizer loading and light harvesting.15,16 Therefore, considerable efforts have been made to two-dimensional (2D) ZnO nanostructures on account of the fact that they have a large surface-to-volume ratio. For example, Leung et al. synthesized vertically 2D ZnO nanostructures grown on ITO substrates by using electrochemical deposition.17 Sun et al. prepared ZnO nanosheets grown on Si substrates by a seed-layer assisted solution route.18 Yet, none of these reported 2D nanostructures is found to be a nanosheet array film with a large percentage of high-energy surfaces. In recent years, special attention has been paid to acquire nanocrystals with exposed high-energy surfaces, which usually show good chemical performance. Representatively, Lu et al. prepared TiO2 nanostructures with a large percentage of high-energy (001) facets, by taking advantage of the selective adsorption of fluoride ions.19 Xie et al. synthesized octahedral SnO2 particles with high-index {221} facets which show enhanced gas-sensing properties.20 Choy and co-workers have demonstrated that ZnO nanoplates with a high population of polar Zn (0001) faces show the highest photocatalytic activity for H2O2 generation.21 These studies demonstrated that high-energy facets with special surface atomic configuration have a substantial effect on the separation and transfer of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.19–22 Such facts gave us the idea to explore the relationship between ZnO crystals with high-energy surfaces and their PEC properties. Therefore, it is worthwhile to develop simple and general solution-phase procedures for the fabrication of orientation controlled 2D ZnO nanostructures with a large percentage of exposed high-energy surfaces.
In the present work, we demonstrate the growth of [110] oriented ZnO nanosheet (ZnONS) array films with a large percentage of high-energy {0001} facets on FTO-coated glass substrates (FTO) using a simple solvothermal route. The structure of ZnONS array films could both afford a direct conduction pathway and achieve a higher QDs adsorption amount. Moreover, the [110] oriented ZnONS array films show excellent optical absorption both in the ultraviolet and visible region. We also carry out an in-depth study on optical properties and PEC properties of CdS/CdSe QDs co-sensitized ZnONS array film photoanodes. The results indicate that this study provides an insight into this kind of composite film (QDs sensitized ZnONS array film with high-energy surfaces) with respect to PEC properties.
2. Experimental details
2.1. Preparation of ZnO nanosheet array films
The synthesis of ZnONS array film involves two steps. First, a ZnO seed layer was preferentially deposited on the clean FTO conductive glass by a sol–gel method.23 Second, ZnONS array films were grown on the ZnO seed layer by a facile hydrothermal process. Briefly, a certain amount of sodium citrate was added into 0.5 M Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O aqueous solution. After stirring for about 5 min, 0.01 mol NaOH was added into above solution with vigorous stirring. The mixed solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave in which the pretreated ZnO buffer/FTO substrate was fixed vertically. Then, the autoclave was kept in an electric oven at 95 °C for 24 h, and finally cooled to room temperature. Subsequently, the samples were washed with deionized water, and dried at 80 °C in air. All the ZnONS array films were annealed at 600 °C for 2 h in air. The annealing process is very important to disintegrate the residual sodium citrate adsorbed on the ZnONS.
2.2. Preparation of QDs sensitized ZnO nanosheet array films
CdS and CdSe QDs deposition was carried out by SILAR technique. For CdS modification, 0.5 M Cd(NO3)2 ethanol solution and 0.5 M Na2S aqueous solution were used as Cd source and S source respectively. The dipping time was 10 minutes. Following each immersion, the films were respectively rinsed with pure ethanol and deionized water to remove excess precursors and dried in a gentle stream of N2 for 1 min before the next dipping. This is called one SILAR cycle. We could increase the incorporated amount of CdS QDs by increasing the number of SILAR cycles. For CdSe sensitization, 0.5 M Cd(NO3)2 ethanol solution and freshly prepared Na2SeSO3 aqueous solution were used, with a dipping time of 10 and 60 min, respectively, still drying in a gentle stream of N2 for 1 min before the next dipping. The Na2SeSO3 aqueous solution was prepared by refluxing Se (0.3 M) in an aqueous solution of Na2SO3 (0.6 M) at 95 °C until Se powder was fully dissolved. The achieved CdS coated ZnO nanosheet array films and CdS/CdSe co-sensitized ZnO nanosheet array films were designated as ZnONS/CdS and ZnONS/CdS/CdSe, respectively, hereafter.
2.3. Characterization
X-ray power diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted on a Rigaku D/max-2500 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The morphology and elemental analysis of the samples were characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) on a JEOL JEM-6700F microscope operated at 8 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were obtained through a JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. UV–visible absorption of the films was performed using a UV-3150 double-beam spectrophotometer.
2.4. Photoelectrochemical measurements
The PEC properties were examined by the conventional three-electrode system with a platinum mesh as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. A mixture of 0.25 M Na2S and 0.35 M Na2SO3 aqueous solution was used as electrolyte. Sunlight was simulated with a 500 W xenon lamp (Spectra Physics). The light intensity was calibrated at 100 mW cm−2 by a laser power meter. The active area was strictly kept within 1 cm2.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Crystalline phase structure

Fig. 1A displays the XRD pattern of the as-prepared ZnONS array film. The XRD diffraction peaks at 31.70°, 36.26° and 56.59° can be well indexed to the (100), (101) and (110) planes of hexagonal wurtzite structure ZnO (JCPDS card no. 36-1451). The preferred (110) peak indicates that the nanosheets are well crystallized and grow in the [110] direction. Compared with the previously reported ZnO crystal diffraction pattern,17,18 the (110) diffraction peak of ZnONS array film is significantly enhanced, and the (002) diffraction peak is almost absent. For wurtzite structure ZnO nanocrystals, the positively Zn2+-terminated (0001) facets and negatively O2−-terminated 000 polar surfaces are more reactive.24 Under thermodynamic equilibrium conditions, the fastest growth rate is along the c-axis due to the higher surface energy of {0001} planes. The dominated facets are thermodynamically stable 100 or 110 facets, rather than the much more reactive {0001} facets.25,26 In our work, we introduced sodium citrate into the hydrothermal process to serve as a structure-directing agent. It works through complexation between Zn2+ ions and citrate ligands to suppress the growth of the [001] direction.21,27 So the formation of nanosheets with a high proportion of high-energy {0001} planes is surely due to a strong suppression of crystal growth along the [0001] axis with a relative enhancement of crystal growth along the 110 and 100 directions, as illustrated in Fig. 1B. In a separate experiment without the use of sodium citrate, no ZnO nanosheet array film was formed on the FTO substrate. These results therefore validate that sodium citrate plays a crucial role in the formation of ZnONS array films.

3.2. Morphologies of ZnO nanosheet array film

Fig. 2A–C show the typical FESEM images of ZnONS array film grown on FTO. It can be seen that the FTO substrate is covered with nanosheets uniformly and compactly. The nanosheets grow vertically on the FTO substrate with the length of 5 μm and thickness of 50 nm approximately. A magnified image in Fig. 2C shows that the exposed side-surfaces of the ZnONS are relatively smooth. A TEM image of monolayer ZnONS, as shown in Fig. 2D, further illustrates that the ZnONS is well crystallized and its surface is smooth. Fig. 2E shows the HRTEM image of a nanosheet. The lattice spacing measured for these crystalline planes is 0.281 nm, corresponding to the (100) planes of wurtzite ZnO. Fig. 2F shows SAED pattern of ZnONS, the diffraction spots are a strong indication that the nanosheet is single crystalline. Evidently, both HRTEM and the corresponding SAED pattern confirm that the nanosheet is a wurtzite ZnO single crystal. Especially, its exposed planes are high-energy {0001} facets, which is consistent with the verdict of XRD.

3.3. UV–visible absorption spectroscopy of ZnO nanosheet arrays
The properties of ZnO nanostructures highly depend on their crystallization and orientations due to the intrinsic anisotropy.28Fig. 3 shows the UV–visible diffuse reflectance absorption spectrum of pure [110] oriented ZnONS array film, and the corresponding plot of (αhv)2vs. hv. Fig. 3A clearly shows that the absorption edge of the ZnONS array film in our work is ~405 nm, a wide absorption in UV region and a certain absorption in the visible light region. Considering that ZnO is a typical direct-band-gap semiconductor, the corresponding optical band gap can be estimated by the zero-crossing of the rising edge of the (αhv)2vs. hv curve, where hv is the photon energy and α is the absorbance. As shown in Fig. 3B, the band gap of obtained [110] oriented ZnONS array film is about 3.1 eV, which is much smaller than the reported 3.37 eV, indicating that the optical property of the semiconductor may depend on a specific crystal structure and crystal plane. Therefore, good PEC performance is expected for the obtained [110] oriented ZnONS array films due to their excellent optical absorption and large exposed high-energy surfaces.

3.4. Morphologies of QDs sensitized ZnO nanosheet arrays

Fig. 4A and B show magnified cross-section view FESEM images of ZnONS/CdS and ZnONS/CdS/CdSe, respectively. In comparison to the bare ZnONS (Fig. 2C), the surface of the QDs sensitized nanosheet is rather rough, indicating that CdS and CdSe nanoparticles have been deposited on the surfaces of the ZnONS. In addition, the CdS/CdSe nanoparticles with diameters of ~13–20 nm in Fig. 4B are larger than that of ~8–14 nm CdS in Fig. 4A. The TEM images (Fig. 4C and D) clearly display that each aggregate nanoparticle consists of a number of QDs with an average diameter of ~3–5 nm for ZnONS/CdS and ~6–8 nm for ZnONS/CdS/CdSe, indicating the growth of QDs after CdSe deposition. To further characterize the arrangement of QDs on the surface of ZnONS, HRTEM of ZnONS/CdS and ZnONS/CdS/CdSe was measured. The larger crystallite appearing in the right region of Fig. 4E is identified to be ZnONS. Around the ZnO crystallite, fine crystallites with various orientations and lattice spacings are observed. By carefully measuring the lattice spacing, we confirm that the crystallites are hexagonal structure CdS. The observed 0.316, 0.168, 0.180 and 0.152 nm fringes of the QDs correspond to the (101), (004), (200) and (104) planes of CdS (JCPDs card no. 75-1545), respectively. Fig. 4F and G are HRTEM images of ZnONS/CdS/CdSe in different regions. Both can distinguish clear lattice fringes of 0.349–0.351 nm and 0.326–0.328 nm within the margin of error which correspond to the (002) and (101) planes of CdSe (JCPDs card no. 77-2307). Also, there are lattice fringes of 0.334–0.336 nm and 0.245 nm within the margin of error corresponding to the (002) and (102) planes of hexagonal structure CdS (JCPDs card no. 75-1545). Especially, CdSe QDs are obviously greater in number than CdS QDs on the surface of ZnONS. We attribute this to the process of our work that CdSe QDs were deposited on ZnONS through SILAR cycles after CdS cycles. This implies that we have realized the original design of CdS/CdSe co-modified ZnONS array films with CdS as an underlayer and CdSe as an outer layer, and excellent PEC performance can be expected. In order to further prove the formation of CdS and CdSe, we performed EDX analysis (Fig. 4H). Cd, S and Se elements were found to be present after the ZnONS were coated with CdS and CdSe QDs, which provides strong evidence for the successful coating of QDs on the surface of ZnONS.

3.5. UV–visible absorption spectroscopy of QDs sensitized ZnO nanosheet arrays
The UV–visible diffuse reflectance absorption spectra of QDs sensitized ZnONS photoanodes are shown in Fig. 5A and B, from which enhanced visible light absorption of ZnONS/CdS and ZnONS/CdS/CdSe composite structures can be confirmed. The pure ZnONS array film absorbs mainly UV light and some visible light with an absorption edge at ~405 nm. However, the UV–visible spectra of ZnONS/CdS(11c) show a significant red-shift of the absorption edge from 405 to 530 nm, while the absorption edge of ZnONS/CdS(9c)/CdSe(9c) appears at 735 nm. These variations indicate that the deposition of QDs has significantly extended the photoresponse of the ZnONS photoanode into the visible light region. The enhanced ability to absorb visible light gives this type of QDs/ZnONS a promising application in photovoltaic devices. We also found that the absorption edge showed a significant red-shift with the increase of CdS or CdSe deposition cycles, which is owing to the gradually reduced band gap of deposited semiconductor QDs. In other words, the gradual red-shift with increasing SILAR cycles corresponds to the growth of the CdS and CdSe QDs. As known from the quantum confinement effect, when the scale of confinement approaches the excitonic Bohr radius, a larger interval between the energy level will emerge, and the energy level will change from a quasi-continuous phase to split phase.29,30 As a result, the band gap becomes size dependent. This ultimately results in a blue-shift in optical illumination as the size of the particles decreases. It is thus thought that the growth of CdS and CdSe particles may be responsible for the red-shift of the absorption edge. It is also noteworthy that the absorption edges (corresponding band gap of CdS) are ca. 470 nm (2.63 eV) for ZnONS/CdS(3c), ca. 490 nm (2.53 eV) for ZnO/CdS(5c), ca. 495 nm (2.50 eV) for ZnONS/CdS(7c), and 510 nm (2.43 eV) for ZnONS/CdS(9c), which are higher than that reported for bulk CdS (2.42 eV). These calculated values reveal that the sizes of CdS nanocrystallines (less than 9 cycles) are still within the scale of QD. For co-modification photoanodes, the absorption edges, mainly representing that of CdSe, are ca. 565 nm (2.19 eV) for ZnONS/CdS(9c)/CdSe(3c), ca. 630 nm (1.97 eV) for ZnONS/CdS(9c)/CdSe(5c), ca. 720 nm (1.72 eV) for ZnONS/CdS(9c)/CdSe(7c), and ca. 735 nm (1.69 eV) for ZnONS/CdS(9c)/CdSe(9c). By comparing them with the value for bulk CdSe (1.70 eV), we see that the average size of CdSe particles is still within the scale of QD when the SILAR cycle reaches 7c.

3.6. Photoelectrochemical performance of the photoanodes

Fig. 6 shows the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves measured from the samples of ZnONS/CdS and ZnONS/CdS/CdSe. All samples show negligible current under dark conditions. With light illumination, the ZnONS array film has a photocurrent density of 0.96 mA cm−2 at 0 V versus SCE. For ZnONS/CdS photoanodes (Fig. 6A), with light illumination, the photocurrent is enhanced by increasing CdS SILAR cycles, indicating that a larger incorporated amount of CdS QDs can induce a higher photocurrent density. However, the output is found to somewhat decrease when the deposition cycles are increased to 11c. This phenomenon may be attributed to the fact that too much CdS deposited would cause conglomeration and growth of the CdS crystal nuclei. The oversized CdS particles will lose the dominance of QD that semiconductor QDs can efficiently generate multiple electron–hole pairs with one single photon absorption and QDs possess large extinction coefficients.31 This is consistent with the results of UV–visible absorption spectra that the size of CdS nanocrystallines exceeds the scale of QD when the SILAR cycles reach more than 9c. Moreover, excess CdS nanoparticles may act as recombination traps for separated electrons and holes. In comparison, the optimum ZnONS/CdS(9c) photoanode shows a photocurrent density of 2.12 mA cm−2 at 0 V versus SCE, which is more than twice the value of the pure ZnONS array film. We attribute the enhancement to the broad range absorption of CdS QDs in the visible light region. The open circuit potential (Voc) is 0.79 V for the plain ZnONS array film photoanode, while it is 1.11 V for the as-prepared ZnONS/CdS(9c) photoanode. As we know, the voltage generated under illumination corresponds to the difference between the Fermi level (Ef) of the electrons in the solid and the redox potential of the electrolyte.32 The variational open circuit potentials measured for these photoanodes indicate that Ef alignment occurs between ZnO and CdS in the composite system.33
 Fig. 6  Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of photoanodes: (A) ZnONS/CdS with varied CdS deposition cycle and (B) ZnONS/CdS(9c)/CdSe with varied CdSe deposition cycle. 
The optimal cycle found for the CdS sensitized ZnONS/CdS photoanodes is 9c (Fig. 6A). So we kept CdS at 9 cycles first when we fabricated ZnONS/CdS/CdSe photoanodes, and the corresponding J–V curves are shown in Fig. 6B. There is a similar phenomenon for ZnONS/CdS(9c)/CdSe photoanodes, that is, the photocurrent density increases with increasing CdSe QDs in the early SILAR cycles to reach a maximum value, and then the photocurrent density decreases with excess CdSe QDs loading. The optimum PEC parameters of ZnONS/CdS(9c)/CdSe(7c) are a photocurrent density of 4.42 mA cm−2 at 0 V versus SCE and an Voc of 1.0 V. Obviously, all the photocurrent densities of ZnONS/CdS(9c)/CdSe(3–9c) are larger than that of ZnONS/CdS(9c). This can be attributed to: firstly, CdSe QDs deposition extends the photoresponse of ZnONS/CdS with a significant red-shift of the absorption edge from 510 to 735 nm, as shown in Fig. 5B; secondly, the typical type-II heterostructures of ZnO–CdS–CdSe have a positive effect on the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.
Moreover, the numerical value of Voc for all the ZnONS/CdS(9c)/CdSe samples is more positive than ZnONS/CdS(9c), which results from the realignment of Ef among ZnO, CdS and CdSe. To understand the mechanism better, we developed a model (Scheme 1) based on the electronic band structure of the CdS QDs, CdSe QDs and ZnO. We depicted the basic structure of the CdS/CdSe co-modified ZnONS array film photoanode (Scheme 1A), the intrinsic relative Fermi level and band edge positions of ZnO, CdS, and CdSe (Scheme 1B), and the main charge transfer processes between ZnO and QDs after being activated by light (Scheme 1C). As shown in Fig. 6, we observe that Voc increases with CdS modification and then decreases with CdSe sensitization but still remains higher than that of ZnO, indicating that Ef realigns between ZnO, CdS and CdSe after their contact. The alteration of the Ef after CdS and CdSe modification is shown in Scheme 1C. Compared with the bare ZnO, Ef shifts to more negative potential when ZnO is coupled with 9 cycles of CdS QDs, which results in a movement of Voc from 0.79 V (versus SCE) to 1.11 V (versus SCE). Since CdS has a higher Ef in comparison with CdSe, when the CdS–CdSe junction is formed, electrons will flow from CdS to CdSe until a new electronic equilibrium is approached. The newly established Ef should locate between those of CdS and CdSe before contact. Therefore, Ef of the ZnONS/CdS(9c)/CdSe composite system shifts to positive potential and thus a lower Voc than the ZnONS/CdS(9c) composite system results, such as 1.0 V versus SCE for ZnONS/CdS(9c)/CdSe(7c) and 0.9 V versus SCE for ZnONS/CdS(9c)/CdSe(9c). Because Ef of both CdSe and CdS are all more negative than bare ZnO, Voc of ZnONS/CdS(9c)/CdSe and ZnONS/CdS would remain larger than that of bare ZnO.

The Ef alignment causes downward and upward shifts of the band edges, respectively, for CdS and CdSe.10,33 Therefore, a stepwise band edge structure formed among CdSe, CdS and ZnO after the alignment. It is advantageous to the electron injection from the conduction bands of QDs to that of ZnO and the holes transfer from the valence band of ZnO to that of CdS follow on CdSe. When the electrons are transported to the anode, the photoexcited holes will be reduced through a reaction with the redox couple (S2−/SO32−) at the anode–electrolyte interface.34 In this way, photogenerated electron–hole pairs are separated and transported to the opposing electrodes efficiently.
In summary, the outstanding PEC properties achieved for ZnONS/CdS/CdSe may be attributed to both the superior structure of ZnONS and QDs sensitization effect. In the case of ZnONS, first, the obtained ZnONS array films have a wider light absorption range with an absorption edge at ~405 nm; second, ZnONS have a large surface area to achieve more QDs adsorption; third, ZnONS array films with a large percentage of high-energy {0001} facets could improve separation and transfer of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and provide a direct conduction pathway for photogenerated electrons. Regarding QDs, first, the deposition of CdS and CdSe QDs significantly extends the photoresponse of ZnONS array film photoanode into the visible light region, which greatly raised the utilization rate of the solar energy; second, the crystalline nature of the QDs afford multiple excitons from the absorption of a single photon; third, the stepwise band edge structure allows a fast and efficient transfer of the photogenerated electrons from CdS QDs and CdSe QDs to the FTO substrate, leading to a much reduced electron–hole recombination rate and much improved photocurrent.
4. Conclusions
In this study, we have synthesized ZnONS array films with a large percentage of high-energy {0001} facets on a FTO substrate by a facile hydrothermal method. Sodium citrate plays a key role in the formation of ZnONS array films as a structure-directing agent through complexation between Zn2+ ions and citrate ligands to suppress the growth of the [001] direction. A ZnONS/CdS/CdSe heterostructure was obtained by the SILAR technique. The UV–visible absorption spectrum shows that the ZnONS array film has a broad absorption range with an absorption edge at ~405 nm, and the as-fabricated photoanode exhibited strong absorption in almost the entire visible spectrum up to 735 nm. Moreover, their application performance studies indicate that the novel [110] oriented ZnONS/CdS/CdSe photoanodes exhibited excellent PEC properties. With light illumination, the photoanode yielded a significant saturated photocurrent of ~4.40 mA cm−2 at 0 V versus SCE. The results suggest that the ZnONS array films with dominant {0001} facets co-sensitized by CdS and CdSe nanoclusters have potential applications in photovoltaic cells, PEC hydrogen generation and photocatalysis.
