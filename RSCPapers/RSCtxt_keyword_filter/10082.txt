    , Accepted 23rd October 2020First published on 26th October 2020AbstractThe increasing consideration toward thin-film organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is because of their high-power conversion efficiency that arises from several advantages of perovskite materials, including solution processability and low fabrication cost. However, we have not been able to maximize these advantages in the existing halide perovskite (PVK) solar cell technology as a consequence of structural and material limitations. Herein, we have developed a solution to these drawbacks by substituting the conventional metal–oxide photoelectrodes with materials doped with carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The mixed cation PSCs fabricated in ambient air were unstable with the PVK on top of zinc oxide (ZnO) due to the presence of hydroxyl groups on the ZnO surface. To suppress the hydroxyl groups, we incorporated CNTs in the ZnO film. On adding CNTs, the ZnO film showed more significant charge extraction, with the recombination rate in the PSC reducing due to higher conductivity and lower trap states in CNT-doped ZnO. Our results demonstrate that the optimized PSC based on the CNT additive showed PCE up to 15%. With this surface modification approach, we could show hysteresis-free and stable PSCs, with lesser decomposition after ∼2000 h of storage in a moist ambience. This work presents novelty in the material, cost, and assembly of stable and effective perovskite solar cells.
1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are a new generation of solar cells and are considered an auspicious technology in the direction of energy conversion compared with the traditional single-crystalline silicon solar cells.2–8 Subsequently, the efficiency of PSCs has improved from 3.9% in the ones assembled earlier to almost 25.2% in a few years.9 To acquire such high-efficiency cells, it is essential to apply both electron- and hole-transport layers in the configuration for efficient charge separation.
One of the benefits of PSC technology is the use of exceedingly tunable materials that are effortlessly deposited as thin films, which permit low-cost amplification. Furthermore, engineering the charge-extraction layers is a critical step in order to confirm the charge extraction process and attain a well-organized current collection. Typically, electron collection is guaranteed via the careful application of a contact layer that consists of semiconducting oxides, such as TiO2, ZnO, or SnO2, and one of the approaches that have been discussed before to improve the charge collection efficiency of the assembled cells is the incorporation of traces of carbon nano-objects, like graphene materials, in the structure of the semiconductor material.10–17
The ZnO electron transport layer (ETL) is a semiconductor metal oxide with desirable characteristics, such as wide bandgap energy, high exciton binding energy, high light absorption and high efficiency, low cost and low temperature for preparation, and high electron mobility over TiO2, which make it a good option for commercialization.18 Besides, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are believed to be one of the effective carbon nano-object materials that can enhance the mechanical and electrical properties of polymer nanocomposites19 and mostly applied in different types of solar cells.20 To obtain superior PSCs, the ETL should be of high quality, pinhole-free, and coating the substrate completely. Hence, to produce suitable PSCs, it is significant to competently engineer the surface of ZnO ETL during the preparation process and verify the morphology and crystallinity.21 Some pathways have been discussed earlier in order to decrease the instability and advance the quality of ZnO-ETL-based PSCs. The employed approaches include interfacial engineering by self-assembled monolayers22–24 and engineering of ZnO ETL using an additive.25–30 It is essential to discover an efficient approach for fabricating high-quality ZnO layers by doping different amounts of CNTs in the structure of the ZnO semiconductor material to augment the interfacial contact between ZnO and the perovskite film to achieve efficient ambient-air perovskite solar cells.
In this paper, we fabricated mixed cation PSCs in ambient air based on both bare ZnO and ZnO doped with different molar ratios of CNTs. The mixed cation PVK was unstable on top of ZnO due to the presence of hydroxyl groups on the ZnO surface. Furthermore, these groups degraded the perovskite and caused poor PSC performance. To suppress the hydroxyl groups, we incorporated carbon nanotubes in the ZnO film. The carbon nanotubes contributed to better interfacial contact between ZnO and the perovskite and allowed perovskite growth with bigger grains and a pinhole-free surface. This surface treatment enhanced the light-harvesting efficiency of the perovskite material. Accordingly, the PCE of the PSCs was remarkably enhanced from 9.12% to almost 15.19% with less hysteresis effect after the addition of CNTs to ZnO ETL. Correspondingly, on using the carbon nanotubes, the ZnO film exhibited more effective charge extraction as the recombination rate reduced in the PSC due to higher conductivity and lower trap states in CNT-doped ZnO. Additionally, we found that the fabricated PSCs retained approximately 82% of the initial PCEs after almost two months of storage in a humid environment. Our study not only provides a practical way to obtain stable and efficient mixed cation PSCs in ambient air but also exposes the critical role of CNTs in improving the interfacial contact between ZnO and PVK in PSCs.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were obtained from Merck. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%), formamidinium iodide (FAI, 99%), and methylammonium bromide (MABr, 99%) were provided by Dyesol. Lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide (Li-TFSI), isopropanol (IPA, 99.5%), and acetonitrile (ACN, 99.9%) were ordered from Alfa Aesar. 4-tert-Butylpyridine (TBP) and patterned fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) were provided by Sigma-Aldrich. Pristine CNTs (diameter ∼8–30 nm, purity ∼98% and length ∼2–12 μm) were purchased from Shenzhen Nanotech Port Co., Ltd.
2.2. Device fabrication
We fabricated PSC devices by employing mixed cation FAI:MABr perovskites as the light-harvesting layers and low-temperature solution-processed ZnO as ETLs. All operations were performed under ambient air conditions and without any control method. The pristine CNTs were modified by using a mixture of sulfuric acid and nitric acid at a volume ratio of 3:1. The mixture was sonicated for 30 min, diluted with 600 mL of deionized water, and then dried in a furnace at 100 °C for 12 h. The patterned-FTO glasses were successively cleaned using a water–soap solution, deionized water, IPA, and acetone in an ultrasonic bath for 5 min each. The FTO glasses were dried in an oven at 80 °C for 20 min and treated with an ultraviolet (UV)–ozone cleaner for 15 min before use. For ETL deposition, ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) were prepared through a cheap and facile precipitation approach, as reported elsewhere.31 The ZnO-NPs were dissolved in chloroform with different concentrations of CNTs (0.0%, 0.1%, 0.5%, and 1.0%). Then, the ZnO:CNT dispersions were spin-coated onto FTO glasses at 4000 rpm for 30 s and sintered at 75 °C for 30 min. For the mixed cation perovskite, 0.458 g of lead iodide (PbI2) and 0.065 g of DMSO were added in 0.5 g DMF and mixed for 1 h at ambient conditions. An FAI:MABr mixture (0.05 g:0.005 g) was dispersed in 1 mL of the IPA solvent. The PbI2 precursor was spun onto the ZnO ETL at 4000 rpm for 20 s. The FAI:MABr mixture was deposited on top of the PbI2 film at 5000 rpm for 40 s and then annealed on a hotplate at 120 °C for 15 min. Subsequently, the hole transport layer (HTL) was deposited on the perovskite layers at 3000 rpm for 25 s. Spiro-OMeTAD (65 mg) was dissolved in 2 mL chlorobenzene with additives containing 16.5 μL LiTFSI/ACN (480 mg mL−1) and 26.5 μL TBP. Finally, 80 nm thick Au electrodes were evaporated on the surface to complete the device fabrication.
2.3. Characterization
CNT morphology was characterized using a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The structural merits of CNT and CNT-doped ZnO films were characterized by Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw MicroRaman, λ = 514 nm) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Bruker). The optical absorption was recorded by UV-visible spectroscopy (Ocean Optics). The atomic force microscope (AFM) images of ETLs were obtained using a Bruker instrument (Dimension Fastscan). The morphological properties of the PVK films were measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, TESCAN). The crystal nature of the perovskites was investigated using XRD analysis (Bruker, D8 advance). The optical characteristics of the perovskites were measured via photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy (Varian Cary Eclipse Fluorescence). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were determined by a Keithley Model 2400 under 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G one sun) illumination. The PSCs had an active area of 0.08 cm2. Charge generation and collection were monitored by measuring the external quantum efficiency (EQE, BunkoukeikiCEP-1500). The Nyquist plots were obtained via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, electrochemical workstation, Zennium 400147).
3. Results and discussion
We found the occurrence of some chemical reaction between the ZnO ETL and the PVK precursors. In order to elucidate the reaction, the ZnO layer was carefully studied. The chemistry of ZnO has been reported by several studies.32–34 MAI absorbs the –OH agents and is converted to CH3NH3OH, and during annealing, this material is degraded to CH3NH2 and H2O in the gaseous phase.35 Such reactions could be the major reason for the decomposition of the PVK layer into the PbI2 layer. To tackle the instability issue of PVK on top of the ZnO ETL, we designed a hybrid structure of ZnO/CNTs using a simple solution approach, as stated in the experimental part. Indeed, the CNT acted as a protective material for the ZnO layer to impede the reaction.

Fig. 1a displays the cell configuration of our devices deposited directly on FTO glass. Photoelectrodes with pure ZnO and CNT-doped ZnO films as ETLs were prepared as explained before. The mixed cation PVK layers were grown directly on the ZnO photoelectrode via a two-step spin-coating method. After the deposition of the PVK film, HTL was spin-coated on the PVK harvester layer. Then, the devices were completed with thermally evaporated Au as back contacts. In this study, the crucial role of the CNT additive is the surface passivation of the ZnO film to enhance the interfacial contact between ZnO and the PVK layer. Indeed, there are several hydroxide groups on the surface of the ZnO film, which may be passivated by CNTs to impede the reaction. Thus, the CNT additive has a beneficial impact by decreasing the instability of PVK on top of the ZnO film. To investigate the impact of CNT doping, we fabricated mixed cation planar PSCs in ambient conditions with the architecture of FTO/ZnO or CNT-doped ZnO/perovskite/Spiro-MeOTAD/Au. Fig. 1b illustrates the J–V curves of the optimized PSCs with ZnO and CNT-doped ZnO as ETLs, measured in the reverse-scan mode under air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5 G) conditions. The device based on 0.0% CNT ETL (reference device) yielded the best PCE of 9.12% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.92 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 17.4 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 57%. The doping of CNT in ZnO resulted in an increase in the overall efficiency of all the investigated compositions. We found that ZnO with 0.5% CNT was the optimal composition for PV performance. This composition had a maximum PCE of 15.19%, Voc of 1.03 V, Jsc of 21.80 mA cm−2, and FF of 69%. This development is primarily attributed to improved Voc and Jsc due to higher conductivity and lower trap states in CNT-doped ZnO. Even with a significant enhancement in the PSC performance, FF improvement was limited in our study, which can be attributed to the chemical reaction between ZnO and the PVK precursor at the interfacial region, leading to low FF values. This reaction produces recombination sites, leading to a reduction in the charge transfer efficiency of the PSCs. The same findings have been reported by Mohammad and coworkers for ZnO:rGO quantum dots/PVK.1 The addition of CNTs weakened the reaction between MAI and ZnO, which could save the ZnO layer much better. Besides, the main characterizations were carried out on 0.0% CNT and 0.5% CNT devices for comparative study. We analyzed the hysteresis effect in the investigated devices based on the forward and reverse scans. The hysteresis index (defined as HI (%) = [Jbackward(Voc) − Jforward(Voc)]/[Jbackward(Voc)] × 100) was obviously reduced in the 0.5% CNT devices (see Fig. 1c and Table 2). The greatly reduced HI can be attributed to better charge transfer and the reduction in recombination due to higher conductivity and lower trap states in CNT-doped ZnO. Further, the validity of the Jsc findings was tested using external quantum efficiency measurements (see Fig. 1d). The combined Jsc values derived from the EQE spectra were 17.72 mA cm−2 for the reference device and 20.12 mA cm−2 for the PSCs with 0.5% CNT, which are in good alignment with the Jsc values obtained from the J–V curves (Fig. 3b). The statistical histograms of all the photovoltaic parameters collected are shown in Fig. 2 and listed in Table 1.

The morphology of CNTs was analyzed by TEM, and well-embedded CNTs could be clearly seen (Fig. 3a). Fig. 3b and c display the AFM images of the 0.0% and 0.5% ZnO:CNT films; the root mean square (RMS) of the surface roughness of the 0.0% and 0.5% ZnO:CNT films were estimated to be 28.30 nm and 17.74 nm, respectively. A ZnO film with a smoother surface is beneficial for improving the contact at the ETL/perovskite interface. To study the surface of the ZnO films, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy were employed. The FTIR patterns of pure ZnO and doped ZnO:CNT films are illustrated in Fig. 3d. The FTIR spectra could be deconvoluted into four major bands centered at 1409, 1578, 2901, and 3443 cm−1, corresponding to C–H bending, CC, the stretching vibration of C–H, and the hydroxide groups (O–H), respectively.36,37 As seen in the spectrum, the pure ZnO film contained some oxygen groups left on its surface that could degrade the PVK material. The FTIR spectrum of the ZnO:CNT film revealed that the O–H band was drastically suppressed after the surface modification of the ZnO film with CNTs, indicating a lower possibility for PVK degradation. The peak of C–H stretching in the FTIR spectrum of pure ZnO was due to the presence of the CH2 and CH3 residual groups. This peak was passivated after adding CNTs in the ZnO solution. The inset of Fig. 3d demonstrates that the Zn–O band shifted to higher wavenumbers due to the interaction between ZnO and CNTs.38 In order to prove the presence of CNTs in the ZnO film, Raman analysis was employed (Fig. 3e). In the pure CNT spectrum, the CNT exhibited two standard Raman bands located at 1330 and 1586 cm−1 related to the disordered mode and tangential mode of the graphitic structure, respectively.39 Meanwhile, the ZnO:CNT film showed the Raman bands of CNTs and an additional band at 504 cm−1, which could be attributed to the ZnO lattice structure.40 This finding confirmed the successful integration of the CNT into the ZnO system.

The surface morphology of the ZnO films (Fig. 4a and b) was studied by SEM. The SEM image of 0.0% CNT film displayed evenly scattered nanoparticles over FTO glass. The SEM images of the 0.0% and 0.5% CNT films were similar to each other, demonstrating no major changes in the surface morphology and uniformity of ZnO due to CNT doping. The optical properties of ZnO and CNT-doped ZnO were studied by UV-visible spectrophotometry. As shown in Fig. 4c, the absorbance of the ZnO film increased slightly after 0.5% CNT addition. The corresponding bandgap was estimated from Tauc plot measurements.41 The optical bandgap (Eg) of the 0.0% CNT film was equal to 3.51 eV, while the bandgap decreased to 3.49 eV after 0.5% CNT doping (see Fig. 4d).

To investigate the changes in the electrical properties of ZnO ETL due to the influence of CNTs, I–V measurement was carried out using the sandwich structures of FTO/ZnO/Au and FTO/ZnO:CNT/Au. The pristine and optimum-concentration (0.5%)-CNT-incorporated ZnO layers had the same optimized thickness. The bias potential between the FTO and Au electrodes continuously increased from −1 V to 1 V. The current–voltage (I–V) plots recorded under the dark for the various ETLs are demonstrated in Fig. 4e. An enhancement in current was observed for ZnO/CNT ETL. From the obtained curves, the conductivity (σ) of the ETLs was calculated using the below relationship,42 I = σoAd−1V(1)where A is the active area, and d is the thickness of the ETLs. The calculated σ values of the ZnO and ZnO:CNT were 3.56 × 10−5 and 4.81 × 10−5 S cm−1, respectively. ZnO:CNT had a higher conductivity than ZnO, which is consistent with the literature and the n-doping nature of CNTs.42 Further, the addition of CNTs promoted a fast and direct pathway for the charge carriers. In order to further understand the mechanism of conductivity enhancement in ZnO:CNT ETL, the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model was used with the electron-only cell architecture, and the obtained J–V plots are depicted in Fig. 4f. The curves could be divided into three regions, namely the Ohmic region, trap-filling limited region, and SCLC region. Firstly, the I–V curves were linear in the low-voltage region. Then, the current revealed a sharp increment after a certain voltage (i.e., trap-filled limit voltages (VTFL)) as the trap states were filled. The VTFL of the pure ZnO film and the ZnO/CNT film was 0.84 and 0.62 V, respectively. The trap-state density (ntrap) of ZnO:CNT (2.01 × 1015 cm−3) was lower than that of pure ZnO (2.68 × 1015 cm−3). In addition, the electron mobilities of the ZnO film and the ZnO:CNT film were 3.2 × 10−3 and 6.9 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Such high electron mobility and the lower trap density of the ZnO:CNT film is beneficial for the efficient forward electron flow, and as a consequence, the photovoltaic performance of the perovskite solar cells improved.
The surface SEM image (Fig. 5a) of the 0.0% ZnO:CNT/perovskite film showed a streamlined perovskite morphology with many pinholes. On the other hand, a pinhole-free dense perovskite film was formed on the surface of the 0.5% CNT ETL (Fig. 5b). In comparison, the perovskite layer deposited on the 0.5% CNT had a greater average grain size (600 nm) than that of the film on 0.0% CNT (400 nm), which explains the higher value of Voc and lower hysteresis in 0.5% CNT-based PSCs. The optical properties of the ETL/perovskite layers were analyzed by PL and UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 5c, both samples developed comparable spectra of absorption in the visible region with onset at 780 nm, which is consistent with the previous report.43 However, the perovskite layer on the ZnO film containing 0.5% CNT exhibited a significant PL quenching effect (improved charge collection) due to lesser surface defects at the interface due to CNT doping. The absorbance of the 0.5% CNT/perovskite film was greater than that of the 0.0% CNT/perovskite film, which illustrated that these perovskite films could harvest more light, which would be favorable to boosting the performance of the PSCs. The XRD patterns of the resulting perovskite films (Fig. 5d) yielded identical crystal structures with the (101), (202), and (211) diffraction peaks at 14.07°, 28.3° and 31.7°, respectively. The peak at 12.7° in the pattern of the 0.0% CNT/perovskite film corresponded to the PbI2 phase and correlated with the decomposition of a small amount of perovskite during thermal annealing.3 On the other hand, no peak for PbI2 could be detected in the XRD of the 0.5% CNT/perovskite film. Moreover, the peak intensities of the 0.5% CNT/perovskite film indicated substantial improvement compared with the 0.0% CNT/perovskite film, especially for the (110) peak, indicating that the addition of CNT could increase the crystallinity of the mixed perovskite.8 As described in Fig. 5e, the prepared perovskite films had the same bandgap value of 1.51 eV.

To further understand the role of the CNT additive, the Nyquist and Tafel plots were studied. The EIS measurements for the PSCs based on pure ZnO and optimized ZnO:CNT are depicted in Fig. 5f. It is clear that the arc of the PSC with the ZnO:CNT film was smaller than that of the PSC based on the pure ZnO film, signifying that the hybrid photoelectrode with CNT and ZnO suppressed the charge-transport resistance (Rtr). The determined ohmic resistance and Rtr values of the optimized ZnO:CNT-based PSC were 11.8 Ω and 43.2 Ω, respectively, which are lower than those of the corresponding control PSC (12.5 Ω and 55.1 Ω, respectively). Evidently, the cell with the hybrid photoelectrode revealed a smaller Rtr, suggesting faster charge transfer ability and lower recombination rate relative to the control cell, as proven by the higher Jsc value. The reduced recombination of electrons and holes corresponding to the lower work function of the ZnO:CNT film endowed an intense built-in electric field in the PSC.44 The TRPL analysis was performed to gain insights into the photo-induced charge dynamics, including charge extraction and recombination. As presented in Fig. 5h, the average recombination lifetime (τave) was determined using a biexponential decay function.45 Compared with the control PSC without CNT doping, the PL decay time significantly dropped for the optimized PSC with 0.5% CNT. The τave reduced from 29.38 ns to 17.28 ns after CNT incorporation, confirming enhanced electron injection from the PVK layer into ZnO.
To obtain insights into the changes in light-harvesting properties when CNTs are introduced into the ZnO ETL, the optical transmittance of the CNT/ZnO films were measured as a function of CNT content, and the obtained transmittance spectra are shown in Fig. 6. As observed, all the ETLs had transmittance >75% in the 350–900 nm range. The pristine ZnO (0.0% CNT) ETL showed a higher average transmittance of 82% in the visible region. Due to the increase in CNT doping, the transmittance of the ZnO films dropped slightly, and the minimum transmittance of 76% was observed for 1.0% CNT-doped ZnO, which is 6% lower than that of the pristine ZnO ETL. The decrement in transmittance with the addition of CNTs is due to the strong light absorption capability of CNTs, which restricts the light transported to the perovskite absorber and induces optical loss; as a result, the photocurrent density (Jsc) of the PSCs decreased. This hypothesis relates well to the literature.41 The optimal electrode with 0.5% CNT-doped ZnO exhibited reasonable transmittance along with good electrical conductivity; hence it can be considered as a better ETL for PSC devices.

Furthermore, for the purpose of commercialization, the stability of the equipment in ambient conditions and during thermal annealing is fundamental. The shelf-life stability of the 0.0% and 0.5% CNT devices was recorded without any encapsulation, as provided in Fig. 7. The devices were stored in a wet condition (∼30% RH), and the PV characteristics were measured over 2000 h. The 0.5% CNT device retained 80% of its initial PCE, which indicates greater reliability relative to the 0.0% CNT device (∼30% of its initial PCE). Moreover, the non-encapsulated device retained over 85% of the initial PCE after thermal annealing at 80 °C for 1000 h in ambient conditions, demonstrating the superior thermal stability of the 0.5% CNT-doped device compared to the 0.0% CNT device. The improved stability of the 0.5% CNT device could be attributed to the better quality of the ETL and the lower trap states in CNT-doped ZnO.

It is worth noting, the obtained results showed that the fabrication of PSCs using the CNT additive in ambient air could boost the efficiency and stability of the devices, which is a step forward in PSC commercialization. Based on the comparison of the results represented in Table 3, it can be argued that the most beneficial approach for CNT usage in PSCs is adding it into the ZnO solution, as reported here.

4. Conclusion
Perovskite solar cells fabricated at a low cost and by a solution processability approach are considered as competitive candidates to silicon solar cells that show promising results. Furthermore, engineering the charge extraction layer is critical in order to confirm the charge extraction process and attain a well-organized current collection. To produce suitable PSCs, it is significant to competently engineer the surface of the ZnO ETL during the preparation process and verify the morphology and crystallinity. Here, we fabricated mixed cation perovskite solar cells in ambient air based on both bare ZnO and ZnO doped with different molar ratios of CNTs. The carbon nanotubes contribute to better interfacial contact between ZnO and the perovskite and allow the growth of perovskite with bigger grains and a pinhole-free surface. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the assembled solar cells increased from 9.12% to 15.19% along with a lesser hysteresis effect after the addition of CNTs to the ZnO ETL. Additionally, we found that the fabricated PSCs retained about 82% of the initial PCEs after almost two months of storage in a humid environment. Our study suggests that incorporating CNTs in the ZnO structure is a viable approach to accomplish high-quality mixed cation perovskite solar cells in ambient air and other related optoelectronic devices for outstanding performance.
