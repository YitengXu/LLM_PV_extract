    , Accepted 22nd February 2021First published on 23rd February 2021AbstractThe luminescent downshifting (LDS) layer in photovoltaics is emerging as a versatile and cost-effective technique to expand solar energy harvesting into new spaces. Herein, we introduce a 2D-BCNO (boron carbon oxynitride)-based silica gel as a transparent, green and rare-earth-free luminophore for such an LDS layer, which is capable of exploiting its highly efficient emission behaviour to enhance light absorption as well as the performance of a Si solar cell. Initial tests with the BCNO gel LDS layer on the top showed a 7.1% improvement in the power conversion efficiency of the Si solar cell. The observed enhancement is very promising, on par with the best in the literature, and it can be further improved by optimizing the BCNO emission.
Introduction
Solar energy generation, being clean, renewable and capable of minimizing impacts on the environment caused by the extensive use of fossil fuels,1 represents the best alternative approach to meet our demand for electricity. The search for solar cells with better power conversion efficiency (PCE), stability and cost-effectiveness has stimulated researchers to focus more on the improved design of photovoltaic (PV) devices. Attaining PCE enhancement in Si PVs, along with cost management, remains a challenging and daunting task.2 The application of luminescent downshifting layer (LDS) on top of the solar cell helps it to harvest more sunlight by collecting the unabsorbed solar radiation, converting it into luminescence, and directing it to the device to improve the conversion efficiency. The exploration of LDS layers to enhance the performance of Si PVs represents a synergetic approach to cut down the cost by generating more electrical power from the same active area.1 Various luminophores have been utilized, such as organic dyes,3 metal oxides,4 inorganic phosphors/rare-earth ions5,6 and semiconductor quantum dots (QDs).7 However, developing a photostable, nontoxic and economical luminescent material with tunable emission and high quantum yield as an LDS material is still a great challenge. Downshifting luminophores are generally the QDs, dyes or rare-earth compounds that absorb high-energy photons and convert them into lower energy photons.8,9 Generally, the luminophore is encapsulated in a polymer matrix,10,11 silica hybrid12,13 or coated on a glass substrate14 to make a thin film to be used as LDS layer. Different polymer matrices have been reported as transparent host, the most commonly used being PMMA.15 The reported LDS layers are always in planar form, with or without substrate, placed on the top of the PV device. Usually, ultrathin glass is preferred as substrate due to its ability to minimize optical loss from reflection and to allow better transmission of photons hitting the surface of the PV device. The use of transparent thin glass substrate to coat the LDS luminophore also helps in the easy replacement of the LDS layer. Both incoming sunlight and the emitted photons from luminophores are directed towards the solar cell, leading to enhancement of its efficiency. A luminophore layer directly coated over the surface of the PV device has also been reported.16–18
These LDS layers have been extensively explored in photovoltaics, with the purpose of tackling the problem of poor absorption in the UV/blue spectral region.19 An ideal luminophore for the LDS layer should possess (i) strong absorption, (ii) a large Stokes shift, (iii) high QY, (iv) high optical transmittance and (v) photostability.9,20 The most investigated LDS luminophores are organic dyes, quantum dots and lanthanide metal ion complexes. As the organic dyes showed narrow absorption with small Stokes shift, leading to reabsorption and low photostability, the attention has recently shifted towards quantum dots. LDS luminophores based on quantum dots such as N-doped carbon dots,21 Si QDs,22 PbS/CdS QDs doped in acrylate,23 CdSe/CdS doped in PMMA,24 thiol-functionalized CuInS2/ZnS QDs,24 CdSe/CdS/ZnS QDs25etc. have been reported. However, the QDs suffer from a global Stokes shift due to the effect of band-edge fine-structure splitting, resulting in overlap between the absorption and photoluminescence spectra. Further, the rare-earth metal ion-based luminophore still presents an obstacle towards the practical application for large-area LDS layers even after increasing the absorption25 and stability26 of the complexes due to its high cost.27
BCNO, a new kind of oxynitride phosphor first reported by T. Ogi et al., is drawing much attention as a potential candidate due to its favourable properties, such as stability,28 wide range of excitation wavelengths from short ultraviolet to blue light, and tunable emission from violet to near-infrared region, with high quantum efficiencies reaching 99%.28–30 The significant features of BCNO phosphors, such as quantum efficiency, can be also tuned with the help of reaction temperature and the choice of carbon source.29 The new efficient light-emitting material BCNO has already shown a wide range of applications, such as in WLEDs,31 displays, bio-imaging, etc.32–34 To the best of our knowledge, the BCNO-based luminophore has not yet been explored as an LDS layer to enhance the PCE of Si solar cells. In this study, we synthesized a highly transparent blue-emitting (380–650 nm) BCNO silica gel using [3-(2-aminoethylamino)propyltrimethoxysilane] AEATMS and introduced it as a luminophore in the thin-film LDS layer over a Si solar cell for the first time.
Synthesis of BCNO silica gel
BCNO powder was synthesised by a simple combustion route, as reported.28,35 The stoichiometric amounts of boric acid (1 mol) as boron source, urea (1 mol) as nitrogen source as well as fuel (1.06 mol), and citric acid (0.002 mol) as carbon source were taken and dissolved in deionized water under stirring to obtain a homogeneous mixture. Then, the mixture was subjected to heat at 100 °C until it was dehydrated. The dehydrated mixture was ignited at 500 (±10 °C) in a box furnace and left for 30 minutes, yielding a pale-yellow product. The obtained product was ground well in a mortar to obtain the fine powder. In a typical synthesis procedure for BCNO gel, 0.5 g of synthesized BCNO powder was dispersed in 10 ml of DI water by stirring for 30 minutes. To the above BCNO dispersion, 10 ml of AEATMS was added and vigorously stirred for about 30 minutes to obtain a clear, viscous solution. Then, this mixture was subjected to hydrothermal treatment in a 50 ml Teflon-lined autoclave at 180 °C for 2 hours. After cooling, BCNO silica gel was collected from the autoclave and stored in a glass vial.
Preparation of BCNO silica gel-based LDS layer
A 22 × 22 mm, 0.13 mm thick glass substrate (>90 transmittance) was cleaned thoroughly by ultrasonicating in isopropyl alcohol followed by ethanol, acetone and DI water. Ten microliters of the obtained BCNO silica gel was coated on the glass substrate by spin coating at 500 rpm for 10 seconds. The procedure was repeated thrice to obtain a yellow transparent thin film of desired thickness. Finally, the BCNO silica gel-coated glass substrate was dried at 80 °C for 1 hour. The schematic representation of the preparation process for the BCNO silica gel is shown in Scheme 1.

Characterization and testing
FTIR analysis was carried out in ATR mode using FT-IR (SHIMADZU IR TRACER-100). UV-visible transmission/absorption studies were carried out in an Agilent-Cary UV-visible absorption spectrometer. Photoluminescence spectra were recorded using a HORIBA-Fluorolog spectrofluorometer. Quantum yield measurement was carried out using an integrating sphere in the HORIBA-Fluorolog spectrofluorometer. HR-TEM analysis was carried out using a JEOL 2100 transmission electron microscope. Thickness was measured using HR-SEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
To check the photostability of the BCNO silica gel, an aging test was carried out under the illumination of UV light (354 nm, 100 W cm−2 irradiance) in ambient condition for 250 and 500 hours (Fig. S2†).
To analyse the performance of the LDS layer, a device was made by placing a 1 × 1-inch LDS layer coated glass substrate directly on top of the 1 × 1-inch standard Si solar cell without any additional clasp. The glass substrate, coated with the LDS layer, was placed on the Si solar cell in two different ways, following the order LDS layer/glass/Si solar cell and glass/LDS layer/Si solar cell. The devices were tested under a solar simulator (Class AAA, Newport) with a Xenon lamp fitted with an AM 1.5 filter and adjusted to provide illumination with a power of 100 mW cm−2 (1 Sun). J–V curves were recorded using a Keithley source measure unit (Series 2400). EQE measurements were carried out with a Bentham PVE300 photovoltaic characterisation setup (illumination irradiance up to 1000 Wm−2 = 1 sun with beam area of 1.85 mm2 from 300 to 1100 nm).
Result and discussion
The FTIR spectra of pristine BCNO, AEATMS and BCNO silica gel are shown in Fig. 1. The spectrum for the BCNO silica gel showed the peak at 782 and 807 cm−1 corresponding to the Si–X436,37 (X = O and C). The peak at 1188 cm−1 can be ascribed to the Si–CH2–R groups of the different silane molecules.38 The peak at 934 cm−1 shows the presence of Si–O bond, corresponding to the in-plane stretching vibration of SiOH. The peaks obtained at 1012 cm−1 and 1106 cm−1 correspond to Si–O–C asymmetric stretching and Si–O–Si vibrational mode, respectively.39,40 Thus, the presence of Si–O–Si vibrational mode indicates the presence of silicate framework formation. The peak at 1460 cm−1 corresponds to the C–H asymmetric bending mode. The peak observed at 1562 cm−1 corresponds to the amide group and suggests BCNO silica gel formation by the incorporation of amine group in the silicate framework via chemical reaction. Further, the peaks at 2837 cm−1, 2938 cm−1 and 3368 cm−1 correspond to the symmetric stretching and asymmetric stretching mode of C–H bond and the N–H stretching vibrational mode, respectively.39 The FTIR spectrum of pristine BCNO sample showed the peaks at 779 cm−1, 1413 cm−1 and 3198 cm−1 corresponding to B–N–B,41 B–N42 and –CN modes, respectively. The peaks at 1317 cm−1 and 1413 cm−1 correspond to B–O bonds. Overall, the presence of B–N, B–N–B, B–O and –CN bonds confirms the formation of BCNO compound. In the case of BCNO silica gel, the presence of C–H, N–H and Si–O–Si modes of vibration confirms the interaction between AEATMS and BCNO to form BCNO silica gel. Thus, it is indicated that the transparent BCNO silica gel was formed due to the interaction of C–H bond of the AEATMS ligand with BCNO.

To further confirm this, the morphology of the as-synthesized BCNO and BCNO silica gel was examined by TEM imaging, as shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b), respectively. The morphology of the synthesised BCNO powder was found to be a 2-dimensional lanceolate-type leaflike structure, with tapering at both ends. It can be proposed that these leaflike structures of BCNO were formed as a result of self-organization, similar to the earlier report by Li Yang et al. on self-organized leaflike structured g-C3N4.41 Lanceolate leaflike structures of BCNO had the length of around 4 μm and width ranging from ∼1.2 to 1.5 μm. Interestingly, the BCNO silica gel showed spherical particle-like morphology, as confirmed by TEM imaging. It can be understood that during the formation of BCNO silica gel, the leaf-structured BCNO was confined to attain spherical particle-like morphology of size ranging from 200 to 700 nm. By comparing our FTIR results with the literature, it can be proposed that the capping of AEATMS through C–H bond and Si facilitates the formation of a spherical morphology through the Si–O–Si framework, as shown in Scheme 1. The condensation reaction of AEATMS with the surface hydroxyl group of BCNO sheets could have resulted in the formation of spherical particles, which is similar to the formation of nanoballs through hydrolysis/condensation in the case of silane-functionalized graphene oxide in the literature.43–45

The optical absorption spectra of pristine AEATMS, BCNO and BCNO silica gel are shown in Fig. 3(a). The absorption spectra of pure AEATMS showed a peak at 275 nm, whereas the pure BCNO showed a broad peak ranging from 300 nm to 420 nm, with the maximum centered at 360 nm attributed to the carbon-related defects.46 The absorption spectra of BCNO silica gel showed a broad peak with maximum centered at 355 nm, with a slight blue shift observed in comparison with pure BCNO that can be attributed to the interaction of BCNO with AEATMS. The broader absorption shown by BCNO silica gel from 276 to 600 nm was attributed to the multiaminosilane-functionalized surface of the BCNO47 and can effectively enhance the luminescence performance.

The photoluminescence spectra of pure AEATMS, BCNO and BCNO silica gel recorded at room temperature using 365 nm excitation wavelength are shown in Fig. 3(b). The emission spectrum of pure AEATMS did not show any characteristic luminescence under 365 nm excitation, whereas the pristine BCNO showed a broad emission peak ranging from 390 nm to 650 nm, centered at 459 nm. The broad emission peak of BCNO phosphor can be attributed to the closed-shell BO− and BO2− ions, which act as highly efficient luminescent centers. The PL spectrum of BCNO silica gel showed a peak centered at 450 nm, with increased intensity compared to that of the pristine BCNO. The absorption and emission spectra of BCNO and BCNO silica gel are shown in Fig. 3(c). The figure reveals a partial overlap between the absorption and emission bands of BCNO (400–480 nm) as well as BCNO silica gel (400–520 nm), indicating the self-reabsorption effect. The quantum yield of BCNO silica gel was measured and found to be 69.9%, which is much higher than that of pristine BCNO (28.9%), as reported in our earlier work.35 The improved emission of BCNO silica gel can be attributed to the fact that it was strongly immobilized by the amide functional groups. This is similar to the effect observed in the case of BCNO-PVA matrix, GQDs33 and the surface functionalization of amine groups in AEATMS.48 The blue shift observed can also be attributed to the surface passivation of BCNO with silica gel.17 The observed photostability of the BCNO silica gel (Fig. S2†), which exhibited the emission property even after 500 hours of UV irradiation, indicates that it could be a good alternative material for LDS layers as compared to the reported luminophores.49–51 It is also possible to further improve the photostability by designing an appropriate ligand structure.26,41
The performance of BCNO silica gel as LDS layer was investigated by employing it with a monocrystalline silicon photovoltaic cell of 22 mm × 22 mm dimension in two different ways: (i) BCNO silica gel LDS layer was placed in direct contact with the Si solar cell with the glass substrate on the top, and (ii) the glass substrate was in direct contact with the Si solar cell, with the BCNO silica gel coating on the top. The thickness of the layer was estimated by FESEM cross-section imaging (Fig. S1†) found to be ∼193 μm. The optical transmittance and PL emission spectra of the glass substrate coated with BCNO silica gel are shown in Fig. 4. The optical transmittance of BCNO gel thin film (LDS layer) on a glass substrate was measured using an uncoated pure glass substrate as the reference in thin-film mode (Fig. S7†). An average transparency of 89.9% for glass/LDS and 88% for LDS/glass configuration was observed in the wavelength range from 300 nm to 800 nm.

The PL emission spectrum of the BCNO silica gel coating on glass showed an emission behavior similar to the BCNO silica gel. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the Si solar cell were recorded with and without the LDS layer at standard testing conditions, and the results are shown in Fig. 5. The average values of the photovoltaic parameters such as Voc, Jsc, fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) obtained from three independent measurements are shown in Table S1 of the ESI.† The performance of the LDS layer, leading to a maximum of about 7.1% enhancement of PCE (from 13.6% to 14.6%), is also evident from the J–V curves showing the significant increment in Jsc. The performance of the LDS layer was again proved using a commercial Si solar cell (Fig. S3 and Table S1†), which also showed that the enhancement of PCE was higher for the glass/LDS layer/commercial solar cell configuration (18% to 18.8%) in comparison to the LDS layer/glass/commercial solar cell (18% to 18.6%).
 Fig. 5  Current–voltage characteristics of (a) glass/LDS layer/Si solar cell and (b) LDS layer/glass/Si solar cell. 
The difference in the performance of both of these arrangements is schematically shown in Scheme 2. It clearly depicts that when the LDS layer is positioned in between the glass and Si solar cell, the light penetrates through the glass as well as the LDS layer to reach the Si solar cell. Hence, the emission from the LDS layer can be more effectively utilized to enhance the PCE. In the case of LDS layer/glass/Si solar cell structure, the light is partially blocked by the LDS layer placed on the top of the PV device. The reflection from the glass surface and also the escape of BCNO silica gel emission could result in relatively less light reaching the surface of the Si solar cell. Relatively stronger reflection in the case of LDS layer/glass configuration was confirmed through the reflectance measurements using the two different configurations (Fig. S4†).
 Scheme 2  Diagram illustrating the effect of LDS layer in enhancing the PCE of Si solar cell. 
To further confirm the LDS behavior, EQE measurements of the Si solar cell were carried out with and without BCNO silica gel LDS layer (Fig. 6). An enhancement in the EQE of the Si solar cell with LDS layer was observed in the spectral region ranging from 350 nm to 1100 nm. However, the reduced EQE response below 350 nm can be attributed to the absorption of light by glass as well as increased light scattering due to the spherical particles of BCNO silica gel.52
 Fig. 6  EQE spectra of Si solar cell with and without LDS layer. Inset: magnified EQE spectra of Si solar cell with LDS layer from 360 to 600 nm. 
To demonstrate and make it more obvious that the improvement in the PCE of the silicon solar cell with BCNO silica gel layer has occurred due to the LDS behavior, the EQE enhancement factor (EQE EF)53 is calculated by using [eqn (1)]: EQE enhancement factor = EQELDS layer/EQEref(1)
Fig. S6 in the ESI† shows the calculated enhancement factor of EQE with and without BCNO silica gel layer. The EQE enhancement factor of BCNO silica gel is higher than unity in the region from 300 nm to 600 nm, corresponding to BCNO silica gel absorption and emission. This confirms that the PCE enhancement has happened due to the LDS behaviour, in accordance with the earlier report.54
Further, we also found that the presence of BCNO silica gel layer on the Si solar cell surface reduces the reflectivity (Fig. S5†), thus indicating the antireflecting behaviour of the LDS layer.54 The enhancement in EQE observed in the wavelength range from 600 nm to 1100 nm could be mainly attributed to the observed reduction in reflectivity.55 Thus, the improvement of EQE in the spectral region from 350 nm to 1100 nm can be explained on the basis of the luminescence downshifting and reduced reflectivity due to BCNO silica gel. This is similar to the increment in EQE response observed for CdSe/CdS QD films as LDS layer.18
The magnified EQE spectra of the Si solar cell with LDS layer are shown in the insets of Fig. 6. It can be observed that the overall photoresponse was slightly higher for the glass/LDS layer/Si solar cell configuration as compared to the LDS layer/glass/Si solar cell configuration, confirming the similar difference observed in the enhancement of PCE.
The enhancement in PCE was observed is on par with the reported results employing other luminophores for the downshifting layer (Table S1, ESI†), such as the red-emitting CdSe/CdS QDs.18 The slightly lesser improvement of PCE observed with the blue-emitting BCNO silica gel can be attributed to the difference in the extent of reabsorption.56 This also indicates that more improvement in PCE can be achieved after optimizing the LDS layer by tuning the emission of BCNO.33 However, it is noteworthy that the initial test using the BCNO silica gel has shown an enhancement in PCE, surpassing most of the literature reports on LDS layers so far using perovskite quantum dots and rare-earth ion-based luminophores.57–60
Conclusion
A highly luminescent BCNO silica gel has been successfully synthesized by a procedure combining the combustion route for BCNO and the hydrothermal method for gel formation. The application of BCNO silica gel for enhancing the PCE of Si solar cells was demonstrated by introducing it as a LDS layer. The obtained results from the initial tests indicated that the introduction of BCNO silica gel thin film as a lamination over the Si solar cell could improve the PCE from 13.6% to 14.6%. This 7.1% improvement in PCE is on par with the best in the reports so far as a sustainable alternative to the toxic quantum dots or costly rare-earth-based complexes. Moreover, further enhancement is possible by fine-tuning the emission of BCNO. This robust, cost-effective and green approach of using the new BCNO-based rare-earth-free luminophore has the potential of realizing the large-scale implementation of LDS layers for solar cells.
