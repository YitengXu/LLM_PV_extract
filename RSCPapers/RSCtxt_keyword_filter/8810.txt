    , Accepted 6th April 2023First published on 25th April 2023AbstractIn this paper, we propose the novel ZrTeS4 single layer and investigate its properties using first-principles calculations. In the equilibrium state, the ZrTeS4 single layer has an anisotropic lattice with high structural stability. The direct band gap of ZrTeS4 is found to be approximately 1.89 eV. Like other narrow-band-gap 2D materials, ZrTeS4 is rather ductile, however its Poisson's ratio is close to that of graphene. Single-layer ZrTeS4 is expected to be a promising non-linear optical material due to its good birefringence and perfect transparency in most of the infrared region. Single-layer ZrTeS4 is favorable for hole–electron separation because it only allows fast mobility of electrons along the x-axis. The absorption coefficient α(ω) is very high in the visible region (at 105 cm−1) and ultra-violet region (at 106 cm−1). The electronic and optical properties of single-layer ZrTeS4 can be tuned by applying different strains. It is reasonable to suggest single-layer ZrTeS4 as a good candidate for optoelectronic applications.
1. Introduction
Excessive energy consumption usually necessitates a restriction on some convenient uses. This sometimes only affects the working conditions, such as the computer or lighting systems. In some cases, the situation may worsen when it affects the heating systems or other civil utilities during the winter. Limiting the use of necessary devices cannot be a viable solution. Modern devices must therefore be more powerful while using less energy. Renewable energy sources, on the other hand, appear to be another promising solution. Both solutions require better technologies built on a new generation of materials. Since the discovery of graphene in 2004 by two scientists, A. Geim and K. Novoselov, single-layer materials have been shown to be very promising materials in solving the problems relating to energy shortages, environmental pollution, and optoelectronic applications.1–7
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are among the most promising single-layer materials.8,9 The combination of transition metals and a wide range of chalcogenides enriches the advantages of these materials’ properties, making them promising for many optoelectronic applications.10–15 The TMDs with asymmetric electronic properties are called 2D Janus materials,16,17 and this anisotropy results in many effects including Rashba spin splitting, second harmonic generation, and polarization of piezoelectricity.16,18 Another sub-branch of TMDs are MXenes, whose constituent chalcogens are carbon or nitrogen.19–21 The MXenes are known to be very promising for highly efficient batteries, nanogenerators, flexible and conductive coatings, and gas sensors.22–25
Layered materials composed of elements from the IVB group (Ti, Zr, and Hf) have recently been discovered to be very promising for applications in optoelectronic and thermoelectric devices.26–32 TiS3 and ZrSe3 monolayers have advantageous thermoelectric properties.29,31 Meanwhile, recent research indicates that ZrTeSe4, HfTeS4, and HfTeS4 monolayers have great potential for use in photocatalytic and photovoltaic devices.33–35 It is worth noting that both ZrTeSe4 and HfTeSe4 possess narrow band gaps of 1.68 eV and 1.1 eV, respectively. A narrow band gap is an important property of 2D materials that are intended for use in near-infrared devices.36–38 Moreover, their unique properties have been shown to be advantageous in fiber optics, photovoltaics, communication, photocatalysis and sensors.39–41 It is necessary to investigate new families of single-layer materials such as MTeX4 (M = Zr, Hf and X = S, Se). The cleavage energies of single-layer ZrS3, ZrTeSe4, and HfTeSe4 are close to that of graphene.33,34,42–44 Therefore, it is possible to introduce a new member, ZrTeS4, to the MTeX4 (M = Zr, Hf and X = S, Se) family. In this paper, single-layer ZrTeS4 is proposed and its structural, electronic, optical and transport properties are studied using first-principles calculation. Moreover, the effects of strain on the electronic and optical properties of single-layer ZrTeS4 are also studied.
2. Calculation method
The atomic model of ZrTeS4 was built based on the structure of the MTeX4 family (M = Zr, Hf; X = S, Se).33–35 Between the two planes of S atoms is a plane made up of Zr and Te atoms, where each of the Zr, Te, and S atoms connects orthogonally to the surrounding atoms. The interaction between single layers was negligible as the height of the unit-cell was set to be c = 20 Å. The structural optimization was performed by first-principles calculations as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation (VASP) package.45 The exchange–correlation functional was described by the traditional generalized gradient approximation modified by J. P. Perdew, K. Burke, and M. Ernzerhof, known as the GGA-PBE method.46 At the same time, the hybrid function by Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06)47 was also used to obtain accurate energy gaps of the investigated semiconductors. Moreover, weak vdW forces between sublayers of ZrTeS4 were also considered by introducing the DFT-D3 (ref. 48) semi-empirical function in the calculation. A mesh of 16 × 16 × 1 k-points in the Brillouin zone was generated using the Monkhorst–Pack method. Each of the Zr, Te, and S atoms was described in the form of a pseudopotential created by the projector augmented wave (PAW) method,49 where the wavefunction was expanded by a plane-wave-basis set with a cut-off energy of 500 eV, and the partial occupancies of orbitals were defined using the Gaussian smearing method with a 0.05 eV smearing width. The convergence of structural optimization was governed by a break condition of 10−4 eV for the electronic self-consistent loop, forces between ions of less than 0.01 eV Å−1, and an electron energy of 10−3 eV.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural properties of single-layer ZrTeS4
The optimized crystal structure of single-layer ZrTeS4 is presented in Fig. 1, and its cohesive energy (Ecoh) was calculated as follows: (1)where Etot, EX, and NX (X = Zr, Te, and S) are the total energy, energy of free element X, and the number of atoms of X, respectively.

Single-layer ZrTeS4 is stable with a negative cohesive energy of −7.93 eV. The crystal structure of ZrTeS4 belongs to the P2/m space group. In the x–y plane, ZrTeS4 has an anisotropic lattice with the lattice parameters a = 3.716 Å and b = 6.551 Å. The calculated results for the structural parameters of ZrTeS4 are shown in Table 1. Due to the multi-valent nature of the Zr and Te elements, their 2D phases can be in a threefold or fourfold configuration.32,50 This allows Zr to bond with one Te and four S atoms forming a buckling single layer of ZrTeS4, see Fig. 1(a), which has an orthogonal lattice. As shown in Fig. 1(c), the Te and Zr atoms are located on a plane sandwiched between two planes of S atoms. This is also a typical configuration of single-layer MTeX4 (M = Zr, Hf and X = Se, S).34,35,51 As shown in Table 1, the lattice parameters of single-layer ZrTeS4 are very close to the corresponding values reported in previous studies for ZrTeSe4, HfTeSe4, and HfTeS4 single layers.33–35 The structural properties of single-layer ZrTeS4 are similar to those of Zr-based single layers containing S, Te, and Se atoms. Because of its multivalent nature, Zr can bond with two S atoms to form a 2D trigonal structure with the lattice parameters a = b = 3.68 Å.30,52 Meanwhile, single-layer ZrS3 has a monoclinic structure, with a = 3.619 Å and b = 5.1 Å.26,44 The lattice parameter increases slightly when one S atom is replaced by one Te atom in single-layer ZrTeS. Because single-layer ZrTeS4 has more than two S atoms, it has a monoclinic structure with two different lattice parameters on the x–y plane. Furthermore, the presence of Te in single-layer ZrTeS4 enlarges its lattice parameter in comparison with that of ZrS2 and ZrS3 single layers. Comparing ZrTeS4 and ZrTeSe4 single layers, it is clear that replacing Se atoms with S atoms causes a 3–4% reduction in the lattice parameters, and a decrease of 5–6% in the bond lengths. Similarly, the lattice parameters and interatomic distances in single-layer HfTeS4 are about 3% and 4–5% shorter, respectively, than those in single-layer HfTeSe4. Therefore, S atoms are expected to create stronger covalent bonds with Hf and Te atoms. In comparison to HfTeSe4 and HfTeS4 single layers, the shorter interatomic distances in compounds containing Zr atoms indicate a larger donation of Zr-orbitals to the covalent bonds, which is discussed in more detail in the following sections via the density of states.

Furthermore, the stability of many 2D materials has been estimated by analysing their phonon dispersion, which can be calculated by using the PHONOPY package.53 Because of the hexagonal structures of ZrTeS4 on the x–y plane, its phonon dispersion was calculated along the line connecting the highly symmetric points Γ–M–K–Γ in the Brillouin zone. As shown in Fig. 1(d), 6 atoms in a unit cell of the ZrTeS4 single layer form 18 positive vibrational modes. The lack of negative vibration modes indicates that the ZrTeS4 single layer is dynamically stable. The slope of an acoustic branch is known to be proportional to a solid's melting point, elastic modulus, and thermal conductivity.54 Therefore, the high slope of acoustic branches at the Γ-point should result in a good thermal conductivity of single-layer ZrTeS4. However, the interference of low-lying optical phonons with acoustic phonons may cause heat transfer scattering and lower the thermal conductivity. This interference comes from the large difference in the electronegativity of Zr (1.33) atoms in comparison with S (2.58) or Te (2.1) causing strong dipole moments that easily interact with low-energy electromagnetic waves to create optical phonons. Strong optical-acoustic phonon interference is also observed in single-layer HfTeS4.35
The phonon analysis can only detect minor atomic displacements. As a result, larger-scale structural changes, such as lattice reconstruction or phase changes, must be studied using molecular dynamics simulation. This method is known as ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation within the framework of first-principles calculation. The atomic structure of single-layer ZrTeS4 was studied at 300 K for 10 ps. The temperature of the atomic system was measured and is shown in Fig. 1(f), where the temperature variation begins quickly at 4 ps and then becomes negligible. Despite the temperature fluctuations, the total energy of the system, as shown in Fig. 1(e), mostly remains near −32.4 eV. This result confirms the absence of any phase change and the thermal stability of the ZrTeS4 single layer at room temperature.
Besides the mechanical and thermal stabilities described above, the mechanical strength is another aspect of single-layer ZrTeS4 that must be studied to estimate the material's synthesis potential as well as its possible applications. Due to the structural asymmetry of single-layer ZrTeS4, its elastic constants C11, C22, C66 and C12 were calculated as functions of the direction angle θ, based on which Young's modulus Y(θ) and Poisson's ratio υ(θ) can be expressed as follows:55 (2) (3)where α = (C11C22 − C122)/C66 − 2C12 and β = C11 + C22 − (C11C22 − C122)/C66.
A graphical visualization of Young's modulus Y(θ) and Poisson's ratio υ(θ) is presented in Fig. 2 in the form of slightly asymmetric circles, which indicates the anisotropy of these two mechanical properties. For comparing with similar materials, these two properties along the x-direction (100) and y-direction (010) were calculated as follows: (4) (5)

Single-layer ZrTeS4 is expected to be stable under pressure as its elastic constants, listed in Table 2, satisfy the Born–Huang criteria,56,57C11C22 − C112 > 0, and C66 > 0. At the same time, single-layer ZrTeS4 is ductile according to Christensen's definition of ductility58 (υ2Dx and υ2Dy are larger than 1/3). The anisotropy of Y2D and υ2D is not significant, therefore external pressure causes nearly the same effect on single-layer ZrTeS4. In comparison with graphene59 (Young's modulus = 342 N m−1 and Poisson's ratio = 0.19), the single layer is rather ductile as its Young's modulus is just about 67–75 N m−1. However, the Poisson's ratio of single-layer ZrTeS4 is nearly equal to that of graphene.

Because the sandwiched structure of ZrTeS4 has two similar planes of S atoms on both sides, its work function is symmetric. The work function is the energy needed to transfer an electron from the surface of a material to infinity, and this physical property is critical for photoelectronic applications. The work function of single-layer ZrTeS4 is 5.7 eV, which is within the range of 4–7.5 eV. Many 2D materials, including 2H SnSiGeN4, the TMDs MX2 (M = Zr, Ta, Mo, Sn and X = Se, S), and MXenes with work functions in this range,60–65 have been shown to be promising in photocatalysis, renewable energy, and photoelectronics. As a result, single-layer ZrTeS4 is expected to be useful in these applications as well. The electronic and other properties of single-layer ZrTeS4 are described in the following sections to provide more information about this aspect.
3.2. Electronic structure of single-layer ZrTeS4
Even though the GGA (PBE) method can accurately predict the optical and other properties of a material, one of the major issues with this method is band gap underestimation.46 To provide reliable electronic characteristics of single-layer ZrTeS4, its band structure (along the highest symmetric path, Γ–X–S–Y–Γ) was calculated using both the PBE and HSE06 approaches. The band structures determined by the PBE and HSE06 methods are shown in Fig. 3(a) as dashed red and solid blue curves, respectively, and the energy levels were shifted so that the highest valence bands are located at the Fermi level. Both approaches reveal a direct band gap in single-layer ZrTeS4, with both the highest valence bands (HVBs) and the lowest conduction bands (LCBs) located at the Y-point. As shown in Fig. 1(a), S-p orbitals contribute the most to the valence bands, while Zr-d orbitals contribute the most to the conduction bands. At the same time, Te atoms play an important role in connecting with Zr and S atoms. Most of the Te orbitals concentrate near the Fermi level, where the hybridization of Te-s orbitals and S-p orbitals dominate the HVBs, and the LCBs are mainly formed by the hybridization of Te-p and Zr-d orbitals.
 Fig. 3  Electronic characteristics of single-layer ZrTeS4 expressed by (a) band structure and partial density of states, (b) Bader charge and difference in electron density, and (c) electron localization function. 
The Bader charge distribution in Fig. 1(b) shows electron transfer from S (yellow balls) atoms to Te (orange balls) and Zr (green balls) atoms, where the Zr atoms attract more electrons than Te atoms. To estimate the distribution of electrons in the areas between constituent atoms in single-layer ZrTeS4, it is necessary to calculate the electron localization function (ELF). The cross section through three selected Zr, Te, and S atoms is divided into fully localized (1.0) red areas, fully delocalized (0.5) green areas, and low electron density (0.0) blue areas. It is obvious that green areas exist between Zr, Te, and S atoms, indicating covalent bonding in single-layer ZrTeS4.
For single-layer ZrTeS4, the HSE06 method yields a band gap of 1.89 eV, which is about 0.6 eV greater than the one produced by the PBE method. The significant difference originates from the fact that PBE methods treat exchange–correlation effects loosely, whereas the HSE06 method considers the interaction of strongly correlated electrons of the d-orbital in Zr atoms. The importance of the Zr-d orbital in determining the width of ZrTeS4's band gap can be explained by the weighted band structures depicted in Fig. 4, where Zr-d orbitals construct a major part of the lowest conduction bands in single-layer ZrTeS4. Moreover, the Zr-d orbitals also take part in the formation of the highest valence bands, and the hybridization with orbitals from Te and S atoms. Considering the relationship between the Te–S and Te–Se bond lengths and the corresponding band gaps of single-layer ZrTeS4 and ZrTeSe4 as listed in Table 1, it is obvious that the shorter bond length leads to a greater orbital splitting effect and a larger band gap. As a result, the PBE band gap of 1.28 eV in single-layer ZrTeS4 is reasonable when compared to the band gaps of 1.05 eV and 1.1 eV in ZrTeSe4 and HfTeSe4,33,34 respectively. The HSE band gap of ZrTeS4 was predicted to be 1.89 eV, and this value is very close to the HSE06 band gaps of ZrTeSe4 and HfTeS4, which are 1.68 eV and 1.73 eV, respectively.34,35

3.3. Optical properties of single-layer ZrTeS4
It is well-known that narrow-gap semiconductors are very promising for solar energy conversion and optoelectronic applications.66–69 Because single-layer ZrTeS4 has a band gap of about 1.89 eV, it is interesting to discover the optical properties of this material. The optical properties can be described in good detail by including the exciton effect in G0W0 + BSE calculations,70,71 however this will significantly increase the computational cost for many strained structures of ZrTeS4. To give a general picture of the optical properties of single-layer ZrTeS4 under different strains, the hybrid method HSE06 was used as this method is known to give acceptable accuracy in predicting optical properties of materials.72,73 For an equilibrium system at the nth state with the wave function  and eigenvalue Ekn, its dielectric constant can be expressed as a function of the frequency ω, ε(ω) = ε1(ω) + iε2(ω), where the imaginary part ε2(ω) is obtained by applying a momentum operator p as follows:74 (6)where k, V, m, and e are the wave vector, volume of the unit cell, electron mass, and electron charge, respectively. The obtained matrix of ε2(ω) is used in the Kramers–Kronig relations (ref. 75) to get ε1(ω), and in the “joint density of state” theory76–79 to calculate other optical properties including the light absorption rate α(ω), refractive n(ω), extinction k(ω), and reflective R(ω) indices. The calculated optical spectra of single-layer ZrTeS4 are presented in Fig. 5, where the energy of the incident wave ranges from 0 to 6 eV. According to the spectrum of the real part shown in Fig. 5(a), single-layer ZrTeS4 is expected to strongly interact with electromagnetic waves whose energies are in the range of 2.5–3.5 eV because ε1(ω) reaches its highest peaks in this energy range. In this energy range, light passing through single-layer ZrTeS4 will mostly slow down and bend due to the high values of refractive index n(ω). The magnitude of nyy(ω), the spectrum of which is shown in Fig. 5(d), is noticeably higher than that of nxx(ω), indicating the ability of single-layer ZrTeS4 to cause light polarization. In the ultra-violet region, the light polarization continues with nxx(ω) > nyy(ω). However, the interaction between material and light becomes weaker as the energy of the waves increases.
 Fig. 5  Optical characteristics of single-layer ZrTeS4 calculated by the HSE06 method: (a) real part of the dielectric function ε1(ω), (b) imaginary part of the dielectric function ε2(ω), (c) light absorption rate α(ω), (d) refractive index n(ω), (e) extinction index k(ω), and (f) reflective index R(ω). 
The imaginary part ε2(ω) becomes highest in the infrared and visible regions (1.5–3 eV); the electromagnetic waves with such energies are most likely to be permanently absorbed by single-layer ZrTeS4. It can be seen in Fig. 5(e) that the extinction index k(ω) reaches its highest values in this energy range. The direction is an important factor because incident light along the y-axis vanishes faster than light along the x-axis. At energy levels higher than 3.5 eV, the magnitudes of ε2(ω) and k(ω) still fluctuate, reaching some lower peaks in the ultra-violet region as they slowly decrease. The loss of energy is associated with the transition of photon-driven electrons from valence bands to conduction bands where they can transfer to some lower conduction bands releasing heat in the material. Therefore, the magnitude of the imaginary part ε2(ω) has a close link to the density of states shown in Fig. 3(a). It is obvious that the highest ε2(ω) peaks at 2.5 eV and 3.7 eV reflect the inter-band transition of electrons from HVBs (formed by hybridization of Te-s and S-p orbitals) to LCBs (formed by hybridization of Te-p and Zr-d orbitals).
The spectrum of the absorption rate α(ω) depicted in Fig. 5(c) shows that single-layer ZrTeS4 is almost completely transparent, with α(ω) ≈ 0 for infrared light whose energy is less than 1 eV. For the energy interval 2–3 eV, the absorption rate sharply increases to its highest values around 4 × 105 cm−1. At the same time, incident light along the y-axis is absorbed more strongly than the incident light along the x-axis. Single-layer ZrTeS4 absorbs ultra-violet light better than infrared and visible light, and the direction dependence of the absorption continues to be significant in this energy range. The reflectivity R(ω), as shown in Fig. 5(f), is lowest (less than 20%) in the infrared range and highest (about 35%) in the visible range. For ultra-violet light, the reflectivity R(ω) remains at a low rate, around 30%.
3.4. Effect of strain on electronic and optical properties of single-layer ZrTeS4
The decrease in structural symmetry caused by strain can significantly alter the properties of 2D materials.80,81 This behaviour has been widely applied to tune the properties of 2D materials for better use in photoelectronic applications.82–86 Single-layer ZrTeS4 was subjected to uniaxial εuni and biaxial εbi strains ranging from −2% to 6%, and the band structures were calculated using the HSE06 method. Due to structural asymmetry in the x–y plane, uniaxial strains were applied along the (100) direction εuni-a and (010) direction εuni-b. The strained band structures are displayed in Fig. 6. All strains cause a shift of HVBs and LCBs resulting in a change of the band gap nature of single-layer ZrTeS4 from direct to indirect. In cases when the HVBs are shifted, the band gap decreases at a higher rate. This phenomenon comes from repulsion between S-p orbitals, and Zr-d orbitals,87,88 which donate majorly to the formation of the HVBs and LCBs, respectively. Under any strain, there are always some constituent atoms that come closer to each other, causing orbital splitting and narrowing of the band gap. As shown in Fig. 7(a), the biaxial strain εbi causes the band gap to drop from about 1.9 eV to below 1.2 eV as the compressive rate increases from −2% to −6%. At the same time, uniaxial strains along the (100) direction εuni-a and (010) direction εuni-b cause smaller band gap decreases, of about 0.5 eV and 0.35 eV, respectively. Tensile strains cause the band gap to drop as well, but at a slower rate. The effect of compressive and tensile strains at 4% on the absorption rate of single-layer ZrTeS4 was calculated and is presented in Fig. 7(b and c), respectively.

 Fig. 7  Effect of strains on (a) band gap, (b) absorption rate at −4%, and (c) absorption rate at +4% for single-layer ZrTeS4 calculated by the HSE06 method. 
Compared to the unstrained ZrTeS4 with an absorption rate of about 4–5 × 105 cm−1 for electromagnetic waves whose energy is in the vicinity of 3 eV, most strained ZrTeS4 has a slightly lower absorption rate, but the absorption range covers more of the infrared and visible regions of the solar spectrum. This is a benefit of strained single-layer ZrTeS4 when used for solar energy conversion purposes because the infrared and visible light regions represent more than 50% of solar energy. From the results presented in Fig. 7(b and c), it is obvious that the absorption rate of single-layer ZrTeS4 can be easily tuned by changing the direction or the rate of strain. Moreover, the absorption rate also varies depending on the direction of the incident waves.
3.5. Transport properties of single-layer ZrTeS4
The charge carrier mobility μ2D of single-layer ZrTeS4 can be calculated based on the total energy E(k), which is a function of wave vector k, total energy E(εuni) and band edge alignment ΔEedge, which are functions of uniaxial strain εuni along the x-axis and y-axis. The total energy E(εuni) and band edge alignment ΔEedge were calculated and are depicted in Fig. 8.
 Fig. 8  Total energy E(εuni) and band edge alignment ΔEedge as functions of uniaxial strain εuni along the x-axis and y-axis. 
According to the deformation potential theory,89 the effective mass m* is inversely proportional to the second derivative of the total energy E(k). The 2D elastic constant C2D, on the other hand, is directly proportional to the second derivative of the total energy E(εuni). (7) (8)where ℏ and Ω are the reduced Planck constant and volume of the unit cell, respectively. The deformation energy is defined as follows: (9)Finally, the charge carrier mobility μ2D is defined as follows:90 (10)where T, kB, and e are the temperature, Boltzmann constant, and the charge of electron, respectively. The calculated transport characteristics of single-layer ZrTeS4 are listed in Table 3.

The transport properties of single-layer ZrTeS4 were calculated over very short distances (0.015 Å−1) starting from the VBM and CBM and proceeding toward the S and Γ k-points in the reciprocal space. As shown in formula (7), the effective masses are inversely proportional to the second derivative of the energy function of the k-points. Both the VCB and CBM are located at the Y-point. The conduction bands in the Y–S direction are greatly concave up, enlarging the second derivative of energy function E(k), which is inversely proportional to the effective mass of electron, resulting in a small electron effective mass of 0.15 m0, whereas the conduction bands in the Y–Γ direction are rather flat, leading to a high electron effective mass of 1.43 m0. In the vicinity of the VBM (Y-point), the slope of the bands along Y–S is a little bit smaller than that along Y–Γ, therefore the hole effective mass along Y–S is slightly larger than the value calculated along Y–Γ. As shown in formulas (7)–(10), the charge carrier mobility depends on how the VBC and CBM change in response to uniaxial strain, as well as the shape of the band structure. This causes the difference in the charge carrier mobilities along different directions, but direction is not the only factor affecting these values. The mobility of electrons along Y–Γ (489.14 cm2 V−1 s−1) is much larger than that along Y–S (114.54 cm2 V−1 s−1). The hole mobility is lower than the electron mobility, partially due to the strongly concave valence bands, but mainly due to the high value of the deformation potential along the x direction (−6.74 eV) in comparison with this quantity for electrons (−1.70 eV). The hole mobility along Y–S is 49.43 cm2 V−1 s−1 and along Y–Γ it is 257.91 cm2 V−1 s−1. In general, the effective masses and charge carrier mobilities of single-layer ZrTeS4 are comparable with those of popular optoelectronic 2D materials such as the tellurides MNTe4 (M = Ti, Zr, Hf and N = Si, Ge), indium monochalcogenide InX (X = S, Se, and Te), and MoS2, WS2, Hf2CO2, and Zr2CO2 monolayers.91–94 The large difference in the mobility is favorable for the separation of electron–hole pairs.
4. Conclusions
The electronic, optical, and transport properties of single-layer ZrTeS4 were studied by applying first-principles calculation. Single-layer ZrTeS4 is mechanically flexible with an anisotropic Young's modulus ranging from 67 to 75 N m−1. Single-layer ZrTeS4 is a semiconductor with a small band gap of about 1.89 eV, which can be easily tuned by strain. Moreover, strain can also cause the band gap nature to change from direct to indirect. The highest valence bands are mostly constructed by s–p hybridization of orbitals from Te and S atoms, and the lowest conduction bands are mainly formed by the p–d hybridization of orbitals from Te and Zr atoms. This specific electronic structure allows single-layer ZrTeS4 to strongly interact with a minor part of infrared waves near the visible region, while it is perfectly transparent to the rest of infrared light. It also possesses good birefringence. These two advantages signify that single-layer ZrTeS4 is a good candidate for infrared laser application. This material can strongly absorb visible and ultra-violet light with low reflectivity. At the same time, the large difference in mobility of electrons and holes can enhance electron–hole separation in single-layer ZrTeS4. These characteristics are helpful in the absorption and conversion of solar energy. Therefore, single-layer ZrTeS4 is expected to be a useful component in devices used for solar energy conversion. The current research introduces a new member of the recently discovered MTeX4 family (M = Zr, Hf and X = S, Se). The revealed properties of single-layer ZrTeS4 make it a promising candidate for optoelectronic applications; however, future studies are required in which the optical properties are described in better detail by including exciton effects and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is calculated to provide a better understanding of the potential of single-layer ZrTeS4 in solar energy conversion.
