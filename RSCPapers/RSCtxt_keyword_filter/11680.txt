    , Accepted 14th August 2012First published on 15th August 2012AbstractThe development of low-cost processes for hydrogen production from renewable energy is of tremendous importance for a truly sustainable hydrogen-based energy system. In this article, we demonstrate the ability to utilize sunlight to produce hydrogen from a potentially low-cost and abundant biomass derivative, glucose, using a WO3-based tandem photoelectrochemical cell (PEC). Thin film WO3 photoelectrodes are shown to exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of a variety of complex oxygenates, with photocurrents that are nearly equal to those achieved in the presence of simple alcohols such as methanol and ethanol. This result indicates that WO3-based PEC reactors can be used as a feedstock-flexible technology. High performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography were utilized to analyze glucose degradation and product formation, respectively, showing that glucose is ultimately oxidized to a mixture of CO and CO2 that depends on reaction conditions. These results suggest that the photoelectrode surface and operating conditions may be adjusted to optimize the production of either H2 or syngas (H2 + CO). In addition to half-cell measurements, unassisted electrolysis of glucose was demonstrated with a tandem cell device consisting of a WO3 photoelectrode, CdTe bottom cell, and WC counter electrode. Using this tandem configuration, a stable short-circuit current density of 1.38 mA cm−2 was recorded under outdoor illumination in 0.33 M H2SO4/0.1 M glucose. This PEC device utilizes no precious metal catalysts and shows great potential as a low-temperature pathway towards H2 and/or syngas production from renewable energy.

Broader context
Photoelectrochemical-driven reforming of biomass-derived molecules represents a promising pathway for the production of hydrogen using only renewable resources, sunlight and biomass, as inputs. In this article, we investigate the use of a WO3-based photoelectrochemical device for the solar-driven reforming of a variety of potentially low-cost biomass-derived oxygenate molecules. Unlike the most commonly studied TiO2 photocatalyst, WO3 thin films studied in this work exhibit similar photocurrents for relatively complex oxygenate species such as glucose and simple alcohols such as methanol and ethanol. This finding shows that WO3-based PEC reactors can be used as a feedstock-flexible technology. Analysis of product gases evolved from the WO3 photoanode also reveals the production of CO, suggesting that WO3-based PEC cells may also be suitable for the production of renewable synthesis gas (CO + H2), a valuable chemical mixture for the production of chemicals and fuels. Finally, this article describes a tandem PEC device using a WO3 thin film photoanode in conjunction with an underlying CdTe photovoltaic component and a low-cost tungsten carbide (WC) counter electrode. This precious metal-free device is used to demonstrate stable, unassisted photocatalytic reforming of glucose under sunlight illumination.

I. Introduction
In order to make the “H2 economy” truly sustainable, low-cost H2 production pathways powered by renewable energy must be developed. One potential pathway that has received increasing attention in recent years is the photoelectrochemical (PEC) conversion of biomass-derived oxygenates.1–3 A flow diagram of this process is provided in Fig. 1, illustrating the basic concept whereby a low-cost, fast-growing biomass feedstock (step 1) is converted into a soluble oxygenate species (step 2), which is further broken down by a PEC reactor (step 3). The final step (step 3) has been referred to as “photoelectrochemical reforming”, in which a photocatalyst uses sunlight to convert biomass-derived oxygenates, CxHyOz, into H2 and CO2. This process is comprised of the following oxidation (eqn (1)) and reduction (eqn (2)) half-reactions: CxHyOz + (2x − z)·H2O → xCO2 + (4x − 2z + y)(H+ + e−), Eo varies(1) (2x − z + y/2)[2H+ + 2e− → H2], Eo = 0.0 V NHE(2)which combine to give the overall reaction for PEC reforming:1 CxHyOz + (2x − z)·H2O → xCO2 + (2x − z + y/2)H2(3)
 Fig. 1  Flow diagram showing the three primary steps of H2 production from PEC-driven reforming of biomass-derived oxygenates. For the final step, the inset shows a tandem PEC device consisting of a thin film WO3 photoanode in series with a narrow band gap photovoltaic (PV) component and a counter electrode (CE). Within this device, oxygenates are oxidized at the WO3 photoanode (eqn (1)) while H2 is evolved at the CE (eqn (2)). 
In contrast to most conventional biomass-reforming processes, this PEC-driven approach is a technologically simple process that can be carried out under ambient conditions and with 100% conversion.1 Furthermore, the high conversion and low-temperature operation reduce the deactivation of photocatalysts from the build-up of coke or tars, which can be a major problem in conventional catalytic reforming processes.4 Although CO2 is generated as an end product, the process can be CO2 neutral because the carbon is originally captured from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. Despite these advantages, there are numerous challenges that must be overcome for PEC reforming of oxygenates to become a practical, low-cost process. Foremost of these challenges is the development of better photocatalytic materials to catalyze the oxidation reaction (eqn (1)), especially for more complex oxygenate species found in realistic biomass feedstocks. Another challenge is the design and demonstration of effective photo-reactors.3 To date, the majority of studies in this area have utilized suspensions of photocatalytic TiO2 particles.3,5 TiO2 is an attractive photocatalytic material due to its good stability and suitable band edge alignment for water splitting, but its large band gap (Eg = 3.2 eV) greatly limits its photocurrent under air mass (AM) 1.5 illumination.5 The photocatalytic activity of TiO2 is also highly dependent on the use of co-catalysts,3 usually expensive precious metals, and is known to decrease substantially with increasing complexity of the oxygenate species.6 Furthermore, PEC reactor systems based on suspensions of photocatalysts pose significant operating challenges related to product gas separation7 and potential particle agglomeration/settling.8
As an alternative to TiO2 photocatalysts for PEC-driven oxygenate reforming, this work has focused on n-type WO3 thin film photoelectrodes. WO3 is an attractive photoanode material because it exhibits good stability in acidic environments, possesses appropriate electron transport properties, and is capable of producing greater photocurrents than TiO2 due to its smaller band gap (Eg = 2.7 eV (ref. 9)).10 However, WO3 has displayed minimal activity as a stand-alone photocatalyst for oxygenate degradation,11–13 which can be largely explained by its poor band alignment with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).10,14 For this reason, a bias voltage must be applied to a WO3 photoanode in order to evolve hydrogen from a PEC cathode. As previously demonstrated for PEC-driven water splitting, this may be achieved by using a tandem cell PEC design commonly referred to as a “hybrid photoelectrode” configuration.15–17 In the inset of Fig. 1, a tandem PEC device is illustrated that consists of a semi-transparent WO3 top cell connected in series with a narrow band gap photovoltaic (PV) cell and a metallic counter electrode. The PV component absorbs the low-energy photons that pass through the WO3 top cell (λ > 460 nm), producing the extra voltage necessary to evolve H2(g) at the counter electrode. Unlike the PEC system based on suspensions of particulate photocatalysts, the hybrid photoelectrode design ensures that product gases are spatially separated, thus allowing for easier collection.
In this paper, we investigate the use of WO3 thin film photoanodes in a precious metal-free tandem cell design that utilizes a thin film photovoltaic (TFPV) material, cadmium telluride (CdTe), as the bottom cell and tungsten carbide (WC) as the counter electrode. Thin film photovoltaic (TFPV) technology based on CdTe has emerged as one of the low-cost technologies in the PV industry,18 while WC is a low-cost alternative to precious metal catalysts that has gained increasing attention as an HER catalyst.19–21 In the first part of the Results and discussion section, half-cell measurements are utilized to study the ability of WO3 photoanodes to photo-oxidize a variety of oxygenate species. This includes several simple alcohols such as methanol, which serve as well-studied probe molecules, as well as more complex oxygenates such as ethylene glycol and glucose that represent potentially low-cost and abundant biomass-derived feedstocks. Next, a combination of analytical techniques is used to study the consumption of glucose and characterization of products. In the third part of the Results and discussion section, the aforementioned tandem cell device is described, and its performance in a 0.1 M glucose electrolyte is presented.
II. Materials and methods
Materials preparation
3 μm thick WO3 thin films were deposited on fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO)-coated glass substrates by reactive magnetron sputtering in a Perkin Elmer 2400 deposition system, as previously described.22 X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed that these films were single-phase WO3 with an orthorhombic crystal structure.23 Single-phase WC counter electrodes were synthesized by direct carburization of W foil in a quartz tube furnace in the presence of H2 and CH4, with complete details provided in previous studies.24,25 5 μm thick CdTe thin films were synthesized in a vapour transport deposition system26 by evaporating 99.9998% pure CdTe crystals from a resistively heated evaporation source onto a slowly translating substrate. The substrate consisted of consecutive layers of CdS (n-type emitter), zinc stannate (buffer layer), and cadmium stannate (conductive back contact) deposited on Pilkington TEC-15 soda lime glass. Following CdTe deposition, a thermal treatment in CdCl2 was performed.27 WO3, CdTe, and WC components were combined as a mechanical stack configuration, with the sides sealed using a 2-part epoxy. Wires were attached to the back and/or front contacts of each individual component, allowing for measurements to be made by external instrumentation. All electrochemical results reported here have been normalized to the geometric surface area of the exposed WO3 photoelectrode, about 3.0 cm2.
PEC and electrochemical measurements
All measurements were performed at near-room temperature conditions and in a deaerated 0.33 M H2SO4 supporting electrolyte freshly prepared from deionized water and concentrated H2SO4 (Fisher Scientific, 96.9%). Oxygenate-containing solutions were prepared using the following chemicals as-received: methanol (Fisher Scientific, 99.9%), ethanol (Sigma Aldrich, 99.5%), ethylene glycol (Sigma Aldrich, 99.8%), glucose (Sigma Aldrich, ≥99.5%), 1-propanol (Alfa Aesar, 99.9%), 2-propanol (Fisher Scientific, 99.9%), n-butanol (Fisher Scientific, 99.9%), acetone (Fisher Scientific, 99.9%), and glycerol (Alfa Aesar, 99.95%). High purity Ar or N2 (99.999%) was used to purge the electrolyte for at least 30 minutes before measurements and to purge the headspace of the PEC test cell during measurements.
All PEC measurements were carried out using an enclosed PEC test cell whose design and operation have previously been described in detail.28 A saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as reference electrode and a 10 cm2 Pt gauze was used as the auxiliary electrode in half-cell measurements. Linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs) were recorded at a sweep rate of 25 mV s−1 while chopping the light source every 4 s, while chronoamperometry (CA) measurements were carried out with applied potentials of either 0.7 or 1.2 V vs. SCE. For outdoor PEC measurements, short-circuit current was recorded with a 46-Range digital multimeter (Radio Shack) interfaced with a laptop computer.
Illumination for LSV measurements and CA measurements conducted during glucose consumption experiments was provided by a 6144 Oriel Xe Arc lamp. The spectral output of the light source was adjusted to better match the AM 1.5 spectrum with two pieces of filter glass (Schott KG-2 and 3024 heat glass). The intensity of the light source was adjusted to AM 1.5 intensity (100 mW cm−2) using two reference Si solar cells (one unfiltered and one filtered with a Schott KG-5 filter having a peak transmittance of 350 < λ < 600 nm). Calibration with the two reference cells ensured that the spectral intensity was calibrated for both the high and low wavelength portions of the spectrum. For CA measurements performed during product gas analyses, a UV LED assembly consisting of high-intensity UV LEDs (peak emission at 365 nm) was used. Performance of the WO3|CdTe|WC tandem device was measured under outdoor solar illumination in Newark, DE. In the test cell arrangement used for the outdoor measurements, the front end of the PEC test cell was tilted downward, with a mirror positioned to reflect sunlight into the cell at a 90° angle. The raw current density produced by the tandem device was corrected to account for optical losses from the mirror (∼17%) and quartz lens of the test cell (∼7%).
Analytical measurements
A high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (HPLC-MS) system was used to measure the rate of glucose consumption during CA measurements. 1 mL of electrolyte was periodically sampled from the PEC test cell during a 7 hour long CA scan, after which samples were diluted and neutralized for HPLC analysis. An online Agilent 1100 HPLC (Agilent Technologies) with a Shodex Asahipak NH2P-50 2D column (2.0 mm ID × 150 mm L, 100 Åm, 5 μm, Shoko America Inc.) was used to separate the glucose. Twenty μL of each sample was injected into the column using an autosampler and eluted to the mass spectrometer at a 0.2 mL min−1 isocratic flow of 75:25 ACN:H2O. A hybrid triple quadrupole/linear ion trap mass spectrometer (2000 QTRAP, AB Sciex) was used to detect and quantify the glucose residue at 179.1 ([M − H]−) m/z in negative ion mode. The concentration of glucose in each sample was determined by comparing its glucose HPLC elution peak area to the area for a control 5 mM glucose sample.
Product gases were detected using an Agilent 7890A GC system (Agilent Technologies) equipped with PLOT Q and molecular sieve columns. Helium was used as the carrier gas, while thermal conductivity and flame ionization detectors were employed at the end of the columns. For product gas collection, WO3 photoelectrodes were positioned vertically in the enclosed PEC test cell in which a side port was fitted with a rubber septum for sampling gas from the overhead space. Samples were taken through the rubber septum using an air-tight and lockable 100 μL syringe (1710 SL SYR, Hamilton Co.). Before the experiment, the electrolyte and headspace within the PEC test cell were purged thoroughly with He. At the conclusion of the CA measurement, the headspace was sampled with the syringe and promptly injected into the GC system for analysis. O2(g), N2(g), H2O(g), CO(g), and CO2(g) peaks were identified based on the control samples, and the peak areas were normalized by sensitivity factors determined for control samples of known composition. During the CA measurement, a small amount of air was found to leak into the test cell. Based on the assumption that all detected N2(g) arose from air infiltration, the amount of detected O2(g) and CO2(g) was corrected for air infiltration based on the measured ratios of (N2/O2) and (N2/CO2) in the laboratory.
Product gases were additionally characterized by mass spectrometry (MS) with a UTI 100C quadrupole mass spectrometer. For these measurements, 13C isotopically labeled [U-13C6] glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, 99%) was used as the reactant to ensure that the detected 13CO(g) and 13CO2(g) were produced by the oxidation of glucose. Product gases were sampled from the headspace of the PEC test cell as described above with an air-tight lockable syringe and immediately injected into the mass spectrometer.
III. Results and discussion
Effect of oxygenate species on photocurrents at WO3 photoanodes
Low-cost supplies of biomass-derived oxygenates are likely to contain a variety of oxygenate species, so understanding how the performance of a given photoanode material responds to oxygenates of varying complexity is crucial for identifying appropriate feedstocks and optimizing photo-reactor performance. For this reason, chopped-light LSV measurements were performed on WO3 photoanodes in a variety of oxygenate species, including simple alcohols, complex alcohols, a ketone, and a carbohydrate. The oxidation reactions for all of these oxygenates are listed in Table 1, along with the corresponding standard reduction potentials calculated from standard thermodynamic properties. Additionally, a LSV was measured in the 0.33 M H2SO4 supporting electrolyte to view the photocurrent behavior in the absence of any oxygenate species. The oxygenate-free H2SO4 solution is an important control for evaluating the selectivity of the WO3 photoelectrode towards oxidation of oxygenate species. Previous studies have established that both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), eqn (4), and the sulphate-oxidation reaction, eqn (5), occur at WO3 photoelectrodes in sulphate solutions.29,30 (4) (5)

The LSV measurements in all solutions are provided in Fig. 2a, where the LSV curve shapes and photocurrent onset potentials are seen to be consistent with previous studies on WO3 photoanodes in oxygenate-containing and oxygenate-free H2SO4 solutions.33,34 Compared to the chopped-light LSV curve in 0.33 M H2SO4, the LSV curves conducted in the oxygenate-containing solutions display photocurrents that are significantly larger, a finding that has been convincingly attributed to photocurrent doubling at WO3 photoelectrodes.35 The photocurrent doubling phenomenon is known to take place in multi-electron PEC reactions, particularly PEC-driven oxidation of oxygenate species. In photocurrent doubling, the initial photo-oxidation of an oxygenate species (R1) by a photo-generated valence band hole (hcb+) is quickly followed by the injection of a second electron (ecb−) into the photoanode conduction band from an adsorbed reactive intermediate, R*ad, forming the product species, R2:33 R1 + hcb+ → R*ad + H+(6) R*ad → R2 + H+ + ecb−(7)

(b) Increase in photo-current for the WO3 photoelectrode at 1.2 V SCE in various oxygenate species compared to the photo-current in 0.33 M H2SO4. (*) The average photo-current enhancement was taken for all oxygenate species except for acetone. Inset shows the photo-current enhancement as a function of oxygenate polarity, expressed by oxygenate dielectric constants. 
In addition to the direct mechanism of photocurrent doubling shown in eqn (6) and (7), an indirect mechanism of photocurrent doubling has also been proposed whereby oxygenate oxidation is facilitated by photo-generated SO4˙ and S2O82− species.33 The indirect mechanism is more likely to occur in dilute oxygenate solutions in which the formation of SO4˙ and S2O82− species are more likely.33 Nonetheless, both the direct and indirect pathways result in the creation of two conduction band electrons per incident photon. This process is of great benefit to wide Eg photoanodes such as WO3, since the ability to produce multiple electrons per incident photon effectively doubles the maximum rate of H2 production as compared to conventional water splitting.
In Fig. 2b, the magnitude of photocurrent enhancement for oxygenate-containing solutions compared to the H2SO4-only solution is provided. The photocurrent enhancement provides a measure of the selectivity of the WO3 photoelectrode towards oxygenate conversion since the competing OER and persulfate reactions (eqn (4) and (5)) are not known to benefit from the photocurrent doubling effect. Excluding acetone, photocurrent enhancements for the oxygenate-containing solutions were found to vary between 59 and 84%, indicating a relatively high selectivity of WO3 photoanodes towards oxygenate conversion. This result has previously been reported for methanol and formic acid,33,35 but the most important finding is that the photocurrent enhancement is relatively independent of the oxygenate species present, varying by ∼25% or less for all species besides acetone. The significance of this result is that WO3-based photo-reactors have the potential to be feedstock-flexible, with little influence of oxygenate chain length or complexity for the alcohols and simple aromatic compounds studied in this work. A clear exception to this observation is acetone, for which the very low photocurrent enhancement can likely be attributed to the high chemical stability of the ketone functional group.
The small variation in WO3 photocurrent for a wide range of oxygenates contrasts sharply with TiO2 photocatalysts, for which H2 production rates have been shown to decrease significantly as the chain length and complexity of the oxygenate increase.1,2,6,36 For example, a study on oxygenate reforming using Pt/TiO2 photocatalysts reported H2 production rates (in μmol h−1) in the presence of the following molecules: methanol (1385), ethanol (1123), 1-propanol (775), 2-propanol (599), ethylene glycol (451), acetic acid (78) and acetone (22).6 Although the variation in H2 production rates for TiO2 photocatalysts have been attributed to a number of factors, the polarity of the oxygenate species seems to be especially important and is strongly correlated to H2 production rates.6,36 TiO2 photocatalysts are most often operated at pH values at or above the point of zero charge (pzc) of TiO2 (pzc = 5.8–6.0), resulting in a negative surface charge that gives rise to electrostatic repulsion between the TiO2 surface and the lone pair electrons on oxygenate species.3 Unlike TiO2, the WO3 photoelectrodes studied in this work were operated at pH values below the pzc of WO3 (∼2.6 (ref. 37)), meaning that the electrode surface has a slightly positive charge that would not repel lone pair donor species. By this reasoning, oxygenate polarity should have a reduced influence on the overall reaction rate at WO3 photoelectrodes. Indeed, this is seen to be true in the inset of Fig. 2b, where the photocurrent enhancement is observed to be only slightly dependent on the dielectric constant of oxygenate species. Further studies are necessary to better understand the differences between the oxygenate conversion at WO3 and TiO2 photoanodes, but the important finding from Fig. 2 is that WO3 can oxidize potentially abundant and low-cost oxygenates such as glucose with current densities that are comparable to the simplest oxygenate, methanol.
Glucose oxidation: reactant consumption and product generation
Despite their usefulness as probe molecules, simple alcohols such as methanol and ethanol are not ideal biomass-derived feedstocks for PEC reforming. Simple alcohols are better suited for direct use in alcohol fuel cells or as fuel additives in combustion engines. Compared to alcohols, more complex oxygenates such as sugars have the potential to be produced from biomass with fewer processing steps, and hence lower cost. Since the results in the previous section showed that glucose can be oxidized at WO3 photoanodes with current densities comparable to simple alcohols, the remainder of this paper focuses on using glucose as a potentially low cost biomass-derived feedstock for PEC-driven reforming.
Glucose conversion at WO3 photoanodes was first verified by using HPLC-MS to track the decline in glucose concentration during a 7 hour PEC measurement in which the illuminated photoanode was held at applied potentials of 0.7 and 1.2 V vs. SCE. Based on the starting concentration of glucose, the amount of glucose reacted after 3, 5, and 7 hours of operation was calculated and plotted in Fig. 3a. From this data, glucose was found to be oxidized at constant rates of 5.8 and 7.3 μmol h−1 at 0.7 and 1.2 V vs. SCE, respectively. Besides verifying consumption of the glucose reactant, the HPLC measurements also provide information about the average extent of reaction of glucose during the experiment. Based on the amounts of glucose consumed and charge passed through the WO3 photoelectrode, an upper limit on the extent of conversion during the 7 hour experiment can be established. In Fig. 3b, the ratio of moles of electrons transferred to the moles of glucose consumed (Re−/g) are plotted, with average values of 5.5 and 8.7 for CA measurements conducted at 0.7 and 1.2 V vs. SCE, respectively. Since complete oxidation of glucose to CO2 and H+ involves 24 e− per molecule of glucose consumed (see Table 1), the results of Fig. 3b indicate that the average glucose molecule is not oxidized all of the way to CO2 under the conditions tested. Rather, most of the glucose oxidation products must be present as CO and/or liquid phase intermediates during the 7 h experiment. This result suggests that WO3 photoelectrodes do not exhibit a strong preference for glucose oxidation over that of its intermediate products. If the oxidation of glucose or its products were favoured with 100% selectivity in the absence of side reactions, Re−/g would be either 2 or 24, respectively. Instead, the observed values of Re−/g indicate that oxidation of glucose and subsequent oxidation of its intermediates occur in parallel. At longer times and higher current densities (CA at 1.2 V), Re−/g is observed to increase with time, reflecting an increase in the percentage of photocurrent arising from intermediate oxidation as the glucose concentration approaches zero. Unfortunately, the presence or absence of intermediates could not be verified in this work because the HPLC-MS system could not detect species with mass to charge ratios <50.
 Fig. 3  (a) Amount of glucose reacted over the course of a 7 h CA measurement carried out in an initial electrolyte of 5 mM glucose and 0.33 M H2SO4. Glucose conversion was determined by HPLC-MS analysis, and the dashed line represents the total amount of glucose available for reaction. CA measurements were performed at either 0.7 or 1.2 V vs. SCE. (b) Time-variation in the ratio of total moles of electrons transferred to moles of glucose reacted. 
HPLC measurements of glucose consumption were complemented by GC measurements used to analyse the gas phase products generated at the WO3 surface and collected from the headspace of the PEC test cell. Fig. 4 contains GC results of gas phase products collected after three and ten hours of operation at 1.2 V SCE in 5 mM and 100 mM glucose solutions. Product gases evolved from the WO3 photoanode and detected by GC included O2, CO, and CO2. No other gas phase products were detected above the background signal. Although the detected quantities and composition of product gases in the headspace are likely to deviate from the actual net product gas composition due to differences in gas solubilities, several qualitative conclusions can be made from Fig. 4. First, notable CO2 and CO peaks were detected for glucose-containing solutions, confirming the ability of WO3 to completely dissociate all the C–C bonds in glucose. This finding was verified by mass spectrometry measurements performed on product gases evolved from solutions containing isotopically labelled C-13 glucose. The ability of WO3 to completely oxidize glucose to CO2 is in good agreement with other studies that have verified complete mineralization of simple oxygenates and more complex pollutants at WO3 photoelectrodes.33 This result is important, since complete oxidation of glucose to CO2 (eqn (1)) is required for a maximum H2 yield from PEC reforming. Significantly less CO2(g) was detected in the test cell headspace for the 100 mM glucose solution than the 5 mM solution, a finding that reflects the fact that the average extent of conversion in the 5 mM solution after 10 hours is significantly higher than that for the 100 mM solution.
 Fig. 4  Amounts of product gases evolved from a WO3 photoelectrode during CA measurements conducted in 5 and 100 mM glucose solutions in deaerated 0.33 M H2SO4 supporting electrolyte. Photoelectrodes were held at 1.2 V SCE under constant illumination by a UV-LED light assembly. Gas quantities were determined from GC analysis of gas sampled from the headspace of the enclosed PEC test cell. 
A second notable result from Fig. 4 is the detection of O2(g) evolved from both the 5 mM and 100 mM glucose solutions, showing that glucose oxidation is not favoured over the OER with 100% selectivity. This result corroborates the findings from the LSV measurements in Fig. 2, for which the absence of perfect photocurrent doubling indicated that oxygenate oxidation did not take place with 100% selectivity. The amount of detected O2(g) for the 100 mM glucose solution after 3 hours is comparable to the quantity of detected (CO(g) + CO2(g)), suggesting that the selectivity towards oxygenate oxidation may only be around 50%. However, this apparently low selectivity, as indicated by GC measurements, can be explained by the presence of undetected liquid phase intermediates. As glucose and its intermediates are gradually depleted in the 5 mM solution over time, the ratio of detected (CO(g) + CO2(g)) to O2(g) is found to increase to 85%, a value which is more consistent with the 74% photocurrent enhancement in glucose that was reported for LSV measurements in the previous section.
Also of interest in Fig. 4 is the detection of significant amounts of CO(g). With few exceptions,38 most GC analyses of product gases evolved from PEC-driven reforming reactions have identified CO2 as the primary gas product, with little CO detected, if any.1,39,40 Previous studies on WO3 powder photocatalysts have reported that the complete degradation of organic pollutants to CO2 on WO3 is slow,13,41 but have not identified CO as an intermediate. Although H2 production was the primary motivation of this work, the GC results suggest that it may also be possible to produce a mixture of H2 and CO, or syngas. Syngas is a valuable commodity for the chemical industry and is also useful for energy applications. Since CO and H2 products are produced at separate electrodes in a thin film, tandem cell device, there is the opportunity to control the syngas composition regardless of the CO/H2 ratio that is actually produced. In Fig. 4, it is also worth noting that the ratio of detected (CO2(g)/CO(g)) is substantially different for the 5 mM (average ratio of 9.5) and 100 mM (average ratio of 3.1) glucose solutions. As shown in the ESI,† the WO3 photocurrent behavior varies greatly from low (< 12 mM) to high oxygenate concentration, and is likely to be linked to this observed concentration-dependent variation in detected (CO(g)/CO2(g)). Although the precise origin of this variation in product gas distribution needs further investigation, this result suggests that the oxygenate concentration can be an important parameter in WO3-based oxygenate reforming. Additionally, reactor pressure and/or catalytic-modification of the WO3 surface could be used to influence the product gas composition.
Demonstration of a WO3|CdTe|WC tandem device
As a proof of concept, a tandem PEC device consisting of a WO3 photoanode, a CdTe PV cell, and a WC counter electrode was constructed to demonstrate unassisted PEC-driven reforming of 0.1 M glucose. By using WO3 (Eg = 2.7 eV) and CdTe (Eg = 1.56 eV) in the hybrid photoelectrode configuration, photons with energies spanning much of the UV and visible regions of the solar spectrum may be effectively harvested. The good optical pairing between WO3 and CdTe is evident from Fig. 5a, in which the optical transmittance (%T) spectrum of a 3 μm thick WO3 thin film is superimposed on the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of an unfiltered CdTe TFPV cell. The WO3 thin film absorbs most photons with energy greater than its band gap energy, λ < 460 nm, but transmits over 50% of photons at all wavelengths above this value. The transmitted light can be efficiently used by a CdTe bottom layer, as is seen in the CdTe EQE spectrum where very high EQE values are obtained over the same region where most light is transmitted by WO3.

(b) Schematic side-view of a WO3|CdTe|WC tandem cell device and photographs of an actual device. External wires attached to each tandem cell component (WO3, CdTe, WC) allowed for measurement of the current–voltage characteristics of either the whole device or an individual component. 

Fig. 5b shows a schematic side-view and photographs of the WO3|CdTe|WC device assembled for this study. Within the device, the CdTe PV component was split into two series-connected cells in order to “match” the current generated by the WO3 and CdTe components. In any multijunction solar cell, current matching is an important design principle whereby materials properties and cell configurations are chosen such that the current generated by each individual component is approximately the same.42 Under normal operation, a CdTe PV cell will generate a significantly higher current density than a WO3 photoanode, meaning that much of the light harvested by the CdTe component would go to waste. In the tandem cell design in Fig. 5b, splitting the CdTe layer into two cells effectively halves the current generated by the CdTe layer, making it comparable to that produced by WO3 but providing the benefit of doubling the voltage produced by CdTe. The higher voltage generated by this configuration allows the WO3 photoanode to operate at a significantly more positive operating potential, thereby greatly increasing the operating current density of the device.
The performance of the WO3|CdTe|WC tandem device was evaluated under outdoor illumination in Newark, DE in solutions of 0.33 M H2SO4 and 0.1 M glucose in 0.33 M H2SO4. All components of the tandem device were connected in series for this measurement, as illustrated in Fig. 5b, and the operating current density was measured without any applied bias (Fig. 6). The device was operated in 0.33 M H2SO4 for the first 30 minutes of the experiment, at which point glucose was added to the cell to give a solution composition of 0.1 M glucose in 0.33 M H2SO4. After an additional 40 minute operation, the incident sunlight was temporarily blocked to verify that the recorded current was indeed photo-generated (Fig. 6b). As seen in Fig. 6a, addition of glucose resulted in a 73% increase in the device operating current, consistent with the 74% photocurrent enhancement in the LSV of an individual WO3 photoanode (Fig. 2). A complete description of the tandem device operation, illustrating how the current–voltage characteristics of individual components can be used to predict performance of the integrated tandem cell device, is provided in the ESI.†

(b) Zoomed-in view of the curve in (a) at point (*) where the device was temporarily blocked from sunlight. Jsc is the current density normalized by the area of exposed WO3. 
In the glucose-containing electrolyte, the operating photocurrent of 1.38 mA cm−2 corresponds to a H2-production rate of 25.7 μmol H2 cm−2 s−1, assuming a faradaic efficiency of 100% at the H2-evolving counter electrode. It is worth noting that the operating current density of 1.38 mA cm−2 exceeds the theoretical maximum current density of ∼1.0 mA cm−2 for TiO2 under AM 1.5 illumination in the absence of photocurrent doubling, highlighting the potential to achieve large H2 production rates using WO3|CdTe-based tandem cells. However, there remains substantial room for improvement in device components. The WO3|CdTe|WC device assembled in this work suffered from large kinetic overpotentials at the WC counter electrode (∼0.3 V), high series resistance in the CdTe components, and WO3 photoelectrodes with maximum photocurrent densities far below the maximum reported values for mesoporous and composite WO3 photoelectrodes.33,43,44 Using state of the art WO3, CdTe, and monolayer Pt-modified WC components will greatly increase the H2 production rates of this cell. Additional gains in performance are also likely to occur through optimization of the PEC reactor conditions (temperature, pressure, etc.) and electrolyte composition (supporting electrolyte, oxygenate concentration, etc.).
H2 generation was not explicitly measured during the operation of the tandem device, but bubbles were observed to continuously evolve from the WC counter electrode throughout the measurement. To check the faradaic efficiency of the WC counter electrode for hydrogen evolution, separate half-cell measurements were conducted in which a WC electrode was subjected to a 10 mA cm−2 reduction current in 0.1 M glucose + 0.33 M H2SO4 while gas bubbles evolved from its surface were collected. GC measurements revealed that the evolved gas was pure H2(g), while the volumetric quantity of gas collected during two different measurements corresponded to faradaic efficiencies of 95%. It is likely that the small deviation in faradaic efficiency from 100% can be accounted for by H2 that escaped collection through dissolution into the electrolyte.
Another important result from Fig. 6 is that the device operating current recorded in each electrolyte was observed to be nearly constant over the course of the experiment, indicating good stability of all device components. The constant photocurrent recorded in the glucose-containing electrolyte also indicates that carbon deposition, or coking of the WO3 surface, does not occur under the conditions used for this measurement. Deposition of carbon on catalytic surfaces is a large concern in gas phase oxygenate reforming,4 in which carbon deposited as coke or tar is known to block catalytically active sites and drastically decrease the reaction rate. However, the significantly lower operating temperatures and the strong oxidizing potential of the WO3 valence band edge (Ev = +2.97 V vs. NHE14) should make carbon deposition much less likely in PEC-driven oxygenate reforming. If carbon deposition were taking place during PEC operation, one would expect that the gradual build-up of carbon on the photoanode surface would slowly block active sites and result in a decrease in the photocurrent. Further evidence that the WO3 surface was resistant to carbon build-up was provided by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), a surface-sensitive technique that revealed a slight decrease in the amount of detected surface carbon on the WO3 photoanode following a one hour CA measurement at +1.2 V vs. SCE in 0.33 M H2SO4 + 0.1 M glucose (see ESI†).
IV. Conclusions
In summary, this work has demonstrated the potential to utilize a WO3|CdTe|WC tandem cell to produce substantial rates of H2 from biomass-derived oxygenates at room temperature and without expensive precious metal catalysts. LSV measurements revealed that relatively complex oxygenate species such as glucose can be oxidized at the WO3 photoelectrode with current densities comparable to those for simple alcohols, demonstrating the great potential of WO3-based PECs to be a feedstock flexible technology. In additional studies focussed on glucose as a potentially low-cost feedstock, GC measurements have shown that glucose is converted to a mixture of CO2 and CO that is dependent on the glucose concentration. Through careful selection of PEC reactor conditions and catalytic modification of the WO3 surface, it should be possible to control the product gas composition, making WO3 photoelectrodes suitable for PEC production of either H2 or syngas. Finally, this work has demonstrated unassisted PEC-driven reforming of glucose with a WO3|CdTe|WC tandem device with appreciable current density and good short-term stability. Future research efforts aimed at optimizing device design, elucidating PEC oxygenate oxidation mechanisms, and understanding how operating conditions influence those mechanisms should enable significant improvements in the PEC-driven conversion of biomass-derived molecules.

Broader context
Photoelectrochemical-driven reforming of biomass-derived molecules represents a promising pathway for the production of hydrogen using only renewable resources, sunlight and biomass, as inputs. In this article, we investigate the use of a WO3-based photoelectrochemical device for the solar-driven reforming of a variety of potentially low-cost biomass-derived oxygenate molecules. Unlike the most commonly studied TiO2 photocatalyst, WO3 thin films studied in this work exhibit similar photocurrents for relatively complex oxygenate species such as glucose and simple alcohols such as methanol and ethanol. This finding shows that WO3-based PEC reactors can be used as a feedstock-flexible technology. Analysis of product gases evolved from the WO3 photoanode also reveals the production of CO, suggesting that WO3-based PEC cells may also be suitable for the production of renewable synthesis gas (CO + H2), a valuable chemical mixture for the production of chemicals and fuels. Finally, this article describes a tandem PEC device using a WO3 thin film photoanode in conjunction with an underlying CdTe photovoltaic component and a low-cost tungsten carbide (WC) counter electrode. This precious metal-free device is used to demonstrate stable, unassisted photocatalytic reforming of glucose under sunlight illumination.
