    , Accepted 13th February 2018First published on 16th February 2018AbstractFor low-temperature paintable carbon based perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the commercial carbon paste utilized to prepare carbon electrodes damages the well-fabricated perovskite films, resulting in bad photoelectric properties. Herein, we have successfully prepared a low temperature perovskite-friendly and environmentally benign carbon paste using propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate as a solvent, which has shown a high electrical conductivity. More importantly, with the exclusive carbon paste, the perovskite film keeps a dense and uniform morphology. The as-developed PSCs do not involve the fabrication of organic hole transport materials (HTMs) which are generally expensive and air-sensitive, greatly limiting the long-term stability. The cost-effective HTM-free carbon-based PSCs demonstrate a champion power conversion efficiency of up to 13.5% and a champion open-circuit voltage of up to 1.07 V with an active area of 0.1 cm2, the highest value reported so far for carbon-based PSCs with MAPbI3 as the light harvester. Furthermore, a long-time stability test shows that the solar cells with the as-prepared carbon electrode retain more than 90% of their initial power conversion efficiency after 960 h.
Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic solar cells, utilizing organometal halide perovskite materials as the light harvesters, have attracted much attention due to their low-cost solution processability and high power conversion efficiency (PCE).1–6 Recently, a record efficiency of 22.7% has been certified, comparable to that of single-crystal Si solar cells.7–9 However, the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is mostly hindered by organic hole transportation materials (HTMs) and noble metal electrodes (e.g., Au and Ag).10–14 Moreover, in most of the state-of-the-art PSCs the fabrication of conventional HTMs usually involves the utilization of spiro-OMETAD,12,14–16 which is costly and unstable in air and the metal electrode has to be conducted in a vacuum environment.14,16–18 Fortunately, perovskites possess ambipolar properties and can be served not only as the light harvester but also as the hole conductor.19 Furthermore, carbon-based materials are abundant with a similar work function to Au electrodes (i.e., ∼5.0 eV) and show great potential as an alternative for practical application.18,20
In HTM-free carbon based PSCs, the photo-generated electrons are transported to an electron transport layer (ETL); meanwhile the photo-generated holes (h+) are transferred immediately to the carbon electrode, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The absence of a HTM causes the direct contact between the commercial carbon paste and the perovskite film,21–23 resulting in that the perovskite films are easily affected by the solvents in the carbon electrode. Therefore, many research groups have made great efforts to solve the problem by prefabricating carbon electrodes. Han et al. prefabricated a scaffold of a mesoscopic TiO2/ZrO2/carbon electrode triple layer, followed by hosting a perovskite absorber, resulting in a PCE of 12.8%.24–27 Yang et al. prefabricated PbI2 and a carbon electrode, which was then subjected to a CH3NH3I bath, avoiding the damage caused by the solvents in the carbon electrode and achieving a PCE of 11.02%.28 Meng et al. improved PCE up to 13.53% by hot pressing a separately prepared carbon film onto the perovskite film.29 Compared to the complex preparation processes, many research groups directly coated the carbon paste on the perovskite film.30–32 For example, Ma et al. changed the solvents of the carbon paste to chlorobenzene to avoid the damage caused by solvents in the commercial carbon paste. Although the low temperature carbon-based PSC simplifies the fabrication process, a PCE of only ca. 9% was achieved with the carbon paste in above efforts.22,23 However for the simplest carbon-based PSC, there still exists no exclusive carbon paste to reach a high efficiency.

In this study, a low-temperature perovskite-friendly carbon paste was designed and prepared for paintable PSCs. The solvents in the as-prepared carbon paste barely dissolve the perovskite film, thereby keeping the morphological homogeneity and exhibiting good light absorption. The as-developed carbon based PSCs could achieve a champion PCE of 13.5% and a champion open-circuit voltage of 1.07 V. The resultant PSC displays great potential for economical applications based on the advantages of the negligible dissolution of the perovskite, low electrode fabrication cost, and simple and scalable low-temperature electrode preparation process.
Experimental
Materials
Dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.5%) was purchased from Aladdin Regents. Methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I, MAI, 99.5%) and lead iodide (PbI2, 99.999%) were purchased from Polymer Light Technology Inc. 40 wt% MAPbI3 precursor solution was prepared by mixing MAI and PbI2 in a molar ratio of 1:1 in DMF. N,N-dimethylformamide, propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PGMEA), propylene glycol monomethyl ether (PGME), diethylene glycol butyl ether acetate (EBAC), ethylene glycol monomethyl ether (EGME), isopropanol, terpineol, isophorone, cyclohexanone, cyclohexane and hexane were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (China). All of the reagents were of analytical grade and used without any further purification. Carbon black was purchased from CARBOT. Graphite was purchased from Qingdao Jiuyi Graphite Inc.
Fabrication of the perovskite-friendly carbon paste
Carbon pastes with different kinds of solvents were prepared. First, polyacrylic resin (10 g) acting as a binder of the carbon paste was dissolved in the solvent (60 g) with vigorous stirring at 100 °C and kept for 2 h. Upon the complete dissolution of the binder, carbon materials including carbon black (Vulan-XC72, 30 nm, 15 g) and graphite (5000 mesh, 45 g) were added to the solution immediately and heated. Then, the mixture was ball milled for 12 h at a rotational speed of 250 rpm.
Fabrication of the perovskite solar cell
Patterned fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 15 Ω sq−1 were cleaned by ultrasonic washing with acetone, ethanol, and deionized water in sequence for 10 min each and then exposed in a UVO cleaner for 15 min. Afterwards a TiO2 sol (0.15 M titanium diisopropoxide bis in 1-butanol) was spin coated on a clean substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 450 °C for 30 min to obtain a compact TiO2 film with a thickness of about 60 nm. A TiO2 paste (Dyesol, 18NR-T), diluted with ethanol with a mass ratio of 1:7, was spin coated on the compact TiO2 at 3000 rpm for 30 s, with subsequent annealing at 500 °C for 30 min. Then, the MAPbI3 precursor was spin coated on the TiO2 layer at 3000 rpm for 10 s. Then the sample was immediately transferred to a sample chamber connected with a vacuum buffer tank by a valve. When the valve was turned on, the air pressure in the sample swiftly decreased to 10 Pa to form a brown, mirror-like perovskite film in 5 s. Then the film was annealed at 100 °C for 15 min with the gas pump method. After the carbon paste was coated on the perovskite film by the doctor-blade method, the sample was annealed at 100 °C to dry the carbon paste.
Measurements and characterization
The resistance of the carbon films was measured by using a four-point probe resistivity measurement system (Keithley 4200A-SCS). The surface morphology of the perovskite films and the cross-sectional morphologies of the PSCs with different carbon electrodes were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, TESCAN MIRA 3 LMH). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured by using a D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer from Bruker in a scanning range of 10–70° at a scanning speed of 0.05° s−1. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained by using a compact steady-state spectrophotometer (Fluoromax-4, Horiba Jobin Yvon) with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm to explore the trap states and recombination of light-excited charge in semiconductors. The time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were obtained by using a PicoQuant Fluotime 300, equipped with the excitation source of PDL 820 with a pulse duration of 25 ps. For the MAPbI3 perovskite film, the excitation wavelength is 508.6 nm and the emission wavelength is 768 nm. The current–voltage (J–V) curves were recorded by using a Keithley 2400 source-meter with an AM 1.5G filter (Sol3A, Oriel) equipped on a 450 W Class AAA solar simulator under an illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The curves were measured with the reverse scanning voltage of 1.2 V to −0.2 V and the forward scanning voltage of −0.2 V to 1.2 V at a scan step of 23.7 mV and a delay time of 100 ms. The electrochemical properties of the PSCs were tested and analyzed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, Zennium IM6, Zahner) with the frequency ranging from 100 mHz to 1 MHz and an AC amplitude of 20 mV under a LED light with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2.
Results and discussion
Screening of solvents
Esters, alcohols, ketones, ethers, and aromatic hydrocarbons are usually used as solvents in the carbon paste, so a series of 10 solvents were employed to investigate the dissolution of the perovskite, including A: propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PGMEA), B: propylene glycol monomethyl ether (PGME), C: diethylene glycol butyl ether acetate (EBAC), D: ethylene glycol monomethyl ether (EGME), E: isopropanol, F: terpineol, G: isophorone, H: cyclohexanone, I: cyclohexane and J: hexane. The dissolution was tested by dropping each solvent on a perovskite film. As shown in Fig. 2, the well-fabricated perovskite films could be evidently damaged by the solvents of B (PGME), D (EGME), G (isophorone), and H (cyclohexanone) after 5 min. When the solvents volatilized completely, the four perovskite films became almost bare and the substrates were exposed. It is predicable that the four solvents cannot play a positive role in the carbon paste for PSCs. However, the perovskite films treated with the other 6 solvents were dissolved slightly. Especially the perovskite films treated with A (PGMEA), C (EBAC), and J (hexane) kept almost the same appearance as those before the solvent treatment. Therefore the remaining six solvents (i.e., A, C, E, F, I, and J) have the potential to be used in the preparation of perovskite-friendly carbon pastes.
 Fig. 2  The surface morphologies of the perovskite samples observed at different times after the contact with the various solvents (A: PGMEA, B: PGME, C: EBAC, D: EGME, E: isopropanol, F: terpineol, G: isophorone, H: cyclohexane, I: cyclohexane, and J: hexane). 
In order for carbon paste to have a high homogeneity, solvents should dissolve the binder well. To examine if a solvent can dissolve the binder, the binder was added to the selected solvents in a mass ratio of 1:6, followed by heating at 100 °C. After heating for 2 h, the solutions with the solvents of A (PGMEA), C (EBAC) and F (terpineol) (Fig. S1, ESI†) are clear without any sediments. In contrast, the solvents of E (isopropanol), I (cyclohexane) and J (hexane) cannot dissolve the binder well.
Furthermore, the morphologies of the perovskite films (Fig. 3a) treated with PGMEA, EBAC, and terpineol were examined by SEM to analyze the damage caused by the above three solvents. It is obvious that the perovskite films treated with PGMEA and EBAC still keep dense, uniform, and full coverage morphologies. However, the perovskite film treated with terpineol produces a rough morphology with flakes on the film surface. The XRD patterns shown in Fig. 3b reveal that the perovskite films treated with PGMEA and EBAC have the diffraction peaks of the perovskite phase of CH3NH3PbI3. However, the phase of PbI2 was observed for the samples treated with terpineol.21 Also, in Fig. 3c, the absorption spectra of the perovskite films treated with PGMEA and EBAC on the TiO2/FTO substrate show stronger absorption compared to that treated with terpineol when the wavelength was shorter than 590 nm. At a longer wavelength (greater than 590 nm), the slightly stronger intensity of the perovskite film treated with terpineol might be attributed to the scattering caused by the rough surface. The steady-state PL spectra of the perovskite layers on the FTO substrate (Fig. 3d) reveal an enhanced PL intensity for the perovskite films treated with PGMEA and EBAC compared with that treated with terpineol. Time-resolved PL spectra in Fig. 3e demonstrate significantly lower quenching rates in the perovskite layers treated with PGMEA and EBAC than that treated with terpineol. The life times of the perovskite films treated with PGMEA, EBAC and terpineol were 62.5, 54.8 and 27.4 ns, respectively, by double exponential fitting. The perovskite film treated with PGMEA has a longer life time, promoting the charge transport efficiently, avoiding the charge accumulation. The stronger PL intensity and the slower decay of the photoexcited carriers for the perovskite layers obtained from PGMEA and EBAC underpin the more suppressed trap mediated nonradiative recombination and thus the lower trap state density,22 resulting from the higher quality of the perovskite films. Therefore, the carbon pastes with solvents of PGMEA and EBAC were supposed to have the potential to be used in the preparation of perovskite-friendly carbon pastes.

Preparation of carbon paste
A small resistance of carbon electrodes could directly produce a small series resistance for the as-prepared PSC, providing a good photoelectric performance. Hence, three kinds of perovskite-friendly carbon pastes were prepared using the solvents PGMEA, EBAC, and terpineol, respectively, by the method mentioned in the Experimental section. Then the resistances of the perovskite-friendly carbon electrodes based on PGMEA, EBAC, and terpineol (denoted as PF-1, PF-2, and PF-3, respectively) and a commercial carbon electrode (CCE) with different thicknesses were determined by the four probe method. The results shown in Table 1 reveal that the resistances of the self-made carbon electrodes are similar to that of the commercial carbon paste. Particularly, when the carbon pastes have a thickness of 10 μm, the resistances of the four carbon electrodes are about 15 Ω sq−1. However, when the thicknesses of carbon pastes are higher than 20 μm, the resistances of PF-1, PF-2 and PF-3 are down to lower than 10 Ω sq−1. And as the thickness changes, the resistance varies little. Therefore, for a fair comparison of the performance of PSCs made with the different carbon pastes, the self-made carbon pastes and the commercial carbon paste CCE with the same thickness (i.e., 20 μm) were chosen to prepare PSCs.

Construction of PSCs
In order to compare the damages of the PSCs by the various CEs, the FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/perovskite film (i.e., without a CE) and PSCs with the different CEs were prepared as described in the Experimental section. The perovskite film was prepared on FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2 by the gas pump method10,33 which shows a dense, uniform, and full coverage morphology, as shown in Fig. 4a and Fig. S2 ESI.† The XRD measurements shown in Fig. S3a (ESI†) reveal the major diffraction peaks of the perovskite phase of CH3NH3PbI3.

Also, the absorption spectra of the perovskite films on the TiO2/FTO substrate and FTO substrate indicate that the absorption intensity of the perovskite films on the different substrates was almost the same, suggesting that the TiO2 film on the FTO substrate can hardly influence the absorption of perovskite films (Fig. S3b, ESI†). Compared with the perovskite/FTO substrate, the photoluminescence emission spectrum of the perovskite/TiO2/FTO substrate displays a clear quenching, suggesting effective extraction of the carriers by TiO2 (Fig. S3c, ESI†). The electrodes of PSCs were fabricated from the above-mentioned four kinds of carbon pastes. SEM images were taken to observe the dissolution of the perovskite films. Compared with the slight dissolution of the perovskite films with PF-1 (Fig. 4d and e) and PF-2 (Fig. 4g and h) devices, the perovskite films with PF-3 and the CCE display evident damages. In the solvent preselection, the average thicknesses of perovskite films without a carbon electrode and with the four CEs were statistical (Fig. 4c, f, i, l and o) and were 358 ± 30 nm, 345 ± 34 nm, 327 ± 53 nm, 186 ± 93 nm and 206 ± 82 nm, respectively. Also the results show that the thicknesses of the perovskite films with PF-3 and the CCE have a wider distribution compared with the films with PF-1 and PF-2. Especially, the thickness of the perovskite film with PF-1 has a similar distribution to that without a carbon electrode. Thus it can be expected that the device with PF-1 has much better photoelectrical properties than the PSCs with the other CEs.
Photovoltaic properties of the various carbon-based PSCs
The photovoltaic properties were tested for the PSCs based on the four kinds of carbon electrodes under an illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The results of the J–V measurements at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 for the champion devices prepared with the different carbon pastes are shown in Fig. 5. Compared with the J–V characteristics of the PF-2, PF-3, and CCE devices, the PF-1 device had an excellent output performance with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.05 V, a current density (Jsc) of 20.25 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.63, yielding a PCE of 13.5% with an active area of 0.1 cm2. The detailed parameters for the champion PSCs are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). According to the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) test, the integrated current density is comparable to the current density based J–V measurement (Fig. S4a and b†). And the steady-state output conversion efficiency at the maximum power point and the PCE of the device with PF-1 are stabilized in the test and are comparable to those in the J–V test (Fig. S4c†). Therefore, the self-made carbon paste using PGMEA as the solvent shows great potential for the fabrication of the perovskite-friendly carbon electrode.34

Furthermore, 16 devices for each cell were fabricated and the photoelectric properties were examined to investigate the quality of the four kinds of PSCs. Fig. S5† clearly shows significantly better performances of the PSCs with PF-1 and PF-2 compared to the PSCs with the CCE. Especially the average PCE of the PSCs with PF-1 could reach up to 11.7%, whereas that with the CCE is only 3.2%, as shown in Fig. S5a.† Remarkably, the PSCs with PF-1 demonstrate a high open-circuit voltage of 1.07 V (Fig. S5b†), the highest value reported so far for HTM-free carbon electrode based PSCs. According to our previous report, the quality of the perovskite films will greatly affect the open-circuit voltages.35 The observed best photovoltaic performance is mainly attributed to the negligible damage of the perovskite film by the solvents in PF-1, which keeps a dense and full-coverage morphology of the perovskite film, resulting in impressive photoelectric properties. However, the devices with PF-3 and the CCE had lower values and broader distribution of the photovoltaic parameters as shown in Fig. S5a–d,† owing to the non-full coverage of the perovskite film. Therefore, we can claim that carbon based PSCs with a high efficiency and a high open-circuit voltage can be well fabricated based on the perovskite-friendly carbon paste with the solvent PGMEA.
To further study the inherent charge transfer behaviors, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed under white light illumination with a power density of 100 mW cm−2 and a bias voltage from 0.85 V to 1.05 V. The Nyquist plots (Fig. 6a and S6 in the ESI†) from 1 MHz to 100 mHz show three semicircles for each curve: the one in the high frequency region (i.e.,106–104 Hz) is related to the perovskite/carbon interface (Fig. S7a, ESI†), the one in the mid-frequency region (104–10 Hz) is for the TiO2/perovskite interface, and the one in the low frequency region is for the perovskite (10 Hz to 100 mHz).36–39 Therefore, by fitting the EIS using the equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Fig. S7b (ESI†), the series resistances (Rs) for the four devices with PF-1, PF-2, PF-3, and the CCE are 15.3, 18.6, 36.5 and 40.2 Ω, respectively, suggesting high conductivity for the device with PF-1. The smaller resistance contributes to the higher photovoltaic performance, especially the higher fill factor. The charge exchange resistances (RCE), presented in Fig. 6b, decrease with the increase of the bias voltage and the lower RCE indicates a more efficient charge transfer process at the perovskite/carbon interface for the device with PF-1. The charge recombination resistances (Rct), presented in Fig. 6c, decrease with the increase of the bias voltage and the higher Rct indicates a lower charge recombination at the TiO2/perovskite interface for the device with PF-1. Compared to the devices with PF-3 and the CCE, those with PF-1 and PF-2 show an excellent internal charge transfer behavior, owing to the good perovskite morphology. Based on the values of RCE and Rct determined for the four devices, the perovskite-friendly carbon paste remarkably alleviates the damage to the perovskite film, contributing to good charge transfer in the PSCs.

The stability of the carbon-based PSCs in ambient atmosphere (humidity: ca. 50%) at room temperature without encapsulation was tested and the derived photovoltaic parameters are plotted in Fig. 7. The PCE, Voc, Jsc and FF dramatically decrease for the devices with PF-3 and the CCE, and these devices retain only ca. 15% of their initial PCE values because the low-quality perovskite film is easily damaged by the atmospheric oxygen and water vapor. However, for the devices based on PF-1 and PF-2, the Voc and Jsc show a tiny increase at the beginning followed by a slow decrease. After about 1000 h of testing, the PSC based on PF-1 maintains more than 90% of the initial PCE and the Voc declines slightly from 1.05 V to 1.03 V. The perovskite-friendly carbon paste (PF-1 carbon paste) evidently reduces the damage to the perovskite film, and helps maintain the uniform morphology of the perovskite film, resulting in more stable photovoltaic behavior for the as-fabricated carbon based PSCs.

Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully developed a perovskite-friendly conductive carbon paste with the solvent PGMEA and applied it to the fabrication of HTM-free PSCs. Carbon electrodes with an excellent conductivity can be prepared by a simple, paintable and low-temperature process. Accordingly, compared to the commercial carbon paste, the perovskite-friendly carbon paste decreases the dissolution of the perovskite film considerably, and the average thickness of the perovskite film with the perovskite-friendly carbon paste only decreases slightly (i.e., from 355 to 344 nm). The carbon-based PSCs prepared with the perovskite-friendly carbon paste and MAPbI3 as the light harvester could achieve a champion PCE of 13.5% and a record open-circuit voltage of 1.07 V along with an excellent stability. All in all, the high efficiency and stability of the device based on the perovskite-friendly carbon paste demonstrates great potential for the commercial production of perovskite solar cells.
