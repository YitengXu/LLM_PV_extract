In particular, DSSC efficiency by virtue of the acid/base characteristics of an electrolyte solvent is well known. In the present study, a non-nitrile solvent, acetylacetone (ACAC), with a higher boiling point (140 °C) has been explored as an electrolyte solvent for DSSCs. J–V characteristics reveal that ACAC is a promising electrolyte solvent that shows higher Jsc resulting from the conduction band edge shift towards a more positive potential, which is attributed to its acidic nature compared to an acetonitrile based electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetry, EIS and dark current analysis confirm that the additive 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) tends to lower the concentration of triiodide drastically in an ACAC based electrolyte. To resolve this issue, use of an alternative additive (8HQ) which shows an increment of ∼10% in current density is demonstrated.
Introduction
Driven by molecular science and nanotechnology, Grätzel invented efficient low cost dye sensitised solar cells (DSSCs) in the early nineties.1 Since then there has been an incentive for the scientific community to work towards enhancing their efficiency as well as stability. The maximum reported efficiency of 13% in DSSCs, as reported by Grätzel et al., has been achieved by employing a Co2+/Co3+ based liquid electrolyte.2 It has already been well established that the electrolyte is a key functional element among the different components of a DSSC.3,4 It plays a pivotal role in determining the photocurrent density (Jsc), photovoltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF). It is noteworthy that the champion efficiencies reported above were obtained with electrolytes based on volatile solvents such as acetonitrile or acetonitrile/valeronitrile.2 The intrinsic volatile nature of the solvents poses a challenge to achieving stability of DSSCs over their long term operation. DSSCs, when operated for a long time, experience deterioration in their performance owing to electrolyte decomposition, solvent leakage, evaporation of additives and loss of triiodide from the electrolyte, in particular at elevated temperatures of ∼80 °C and above.5,6 To address the challenge because of solvent volatility, a different class of solvents that have high boiling points and low melting points such as γ-butyrolactone (GBL), propylenecarbonate (PC), propionitrile (PN), butyronitrile (BN) and 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN) have been employed.3,4 Only a limited number of studies have been carried out on DSSCs utilizing the less volatile solvents mentioned above. Sauvage et al. obtained a power conversion efficiency of 10% with a butyronitrile-based electrolyte in DSSCs and showed 95% retention of the efficiency after 1000 h light soaking exposure and thermal stress at 60 °C.7 Falaras et al. used tetraglyme (TGL) as an electrolyte solvent and obtained a cell efficiency of 3.7%, of which only 20% reduction was observed after a harsh ageing test of 2000 (light) + 2000 (dark at 80 °C) hours.8
Besides impacting DSSC stability, solvent also plays a vital role in terms of thermodynamic and kinetic properties at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.3,4 In particular solvent donor number (DN) dramatically influences Voc and Jsc, thereby resulting in a Jsc–Voc trade-off.9–11 Stergiopoulos et al. reported the influence of the DN of different solvents on chemical capacitance and recombination kinetics, claiming that solvent functions effectively in controlling electron energetics at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.12 Recently, Hao et al. pointed out the effect of the dipole moment of solvent on Jsc and Voc and showed that Jsc increased with increasing order of dipole moment as DMF (N,N-dimethylformamide) < MPN (3-methoxypropionitrile) < GBL (butyrolactone) and vice versa for Voc.13
While some high boiling solvents have been tried, until now acetylacetone (ACAC) has not been explored as an electrolyte solvent in DSSCs despite its known high boiling point (140 °C), low melting point (−23 °C) and low viscosity (1.09 cP) at room temperature. In this study for the first time we demonstrate the use of acetylacetone as an electrolyte solvent for dye sensitized solar cells. A notable feature of this solvent based electrolyte is its acidic nature which was expected to cause a shift in the conduction band edge of TiO2, corresponding to a change in short circuit current density in DSSCs. Based on preliminary observations suggesting that TBP, the commonly used additive in electrolytes, may not be compatible with acetylacetone solvent, the use of an alternate additive also has been examined.
Experimental and characterization
A TiO2 photoanode was prepared using a slurry made with 6% v/v commercial Degussa P25 TiO2 powder, polyethyleneglycol (PEG600) (Merck, Mumbai, India) and ethanol. A doctor-blading technique was used for repetitive coating on a cleaned and dried FTO substrate over an area of 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm and sintering was carried out at 450 °C for 1 h. Thickness was confined to around 17 μm as measured using a surface profilometer (KLA Tencor Alpha D-100). The film was sensitized by dipping in an ethanolic dye solution containing 0.3 mM N3 dye (from Dyesol, Queanbeyan NSW, Australia) for 24 h in darkness and then rinsing with ethanol followed by drying under an air flow. A sputter deposited, 60 nm thick Pt coating over an FTO substrate was used as a counter electrode. The electrolyte composition was 0.5 M PMII (Sigma Aldrich) and 0.05 M I2 (Thomas Baker, Mumbai, India) in acetylacetone (ACAC) solvent. Additives 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) (Aldrich) and 0.5 M 8-hydroxyquinoline (8HQ) were added to the electrolyte of the same composition as mentioned above. For reference an electrolyte with PMII, I2 and TBP in acetonitrile (ACN) solvent was prepared. The pH of the different electrolytes was measured using a pH meter (Eutech Instruments). Finally, cells were prepared with Surlyn film (25 μm, Solaronix) sandwiched between the TiO2 photoanode and Pt counter electrode and the gap between the electrodes was filled with the above electrolytes.
DSSCs were tested under a Xenon lamp AM 1.5 solar simulator (Newport) and in the dark using a Keithley (Model 2420) source meter. The active area of the cell was 0.25 cm2. Steady state cyclic voltammetry measurements for the symmetric cells FTO-Pt/electrolyte/Pt-FTO were run using an AutoLab Model PGSTAT 302N system at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Nyquist plots of the symmetric cells were obtained from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements at a bias voltage of 0 V and at an amplitude of 10 mV in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz under dark conditions. To obtain capacitance–voltage curves, EIS measurements for the DSSC devices with different electrolyte solvents were performed in the dark at different forward biases using an AutoLab PGSTAT 302N system with a frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz at a potential modulation of 10 mV. For the EIS measurements required for a Mott–Schottky plot, devices were made in a similar fashion as mentioned previously except that bare TiO2 films were used. A Mott–Schottky plot was automatically generated by the NOVA 1.7 software itself.
Results and discussion
The photovoltaic characteristics (J–V curves) of DSSCs with different electrolytes were measured and are shown in Fig. 1, and the corresponding parameters from the J–V curves are summarized in Table 1. It can be observed that replacing acetonitrile with acetylacetone in the commonly used acetonitrile–TBP based electrolyte results in approximately a 9% increase in Jsc, 11% reduction in Voc and yields 21% lower conversion efficiency. Thus, it appears that though cell performance is slightly reduced with the use of ACAC, it satisfies the minimum requirements of an electrolyte solvent for DSSCs. As mentioned earlier, a striking feature of this ACAC based electrolyte is its acidic nature. The pH of the ACAC based electrolyte (without any additive) was found to be 4.8 as opposed to the pH value of 7.5 of the commonly used acetonitrile based electrolyte. The acidic nature of the electrolyte is known to result in efficient tethering of the sensitizing dye molecules onto the TiO2 surface due to the presence of negatively charged carboxylate anchoring groups of the dye molecules. Analysis based on density functional theory concludes that the interactions between the oxidized dye and iodide ions increase with the counter cations of iodide in the electrolyte in the order of TBA+ < DMPI+ < Li+ < H+, thereby influencing the short circuit photocurrent density in DSSCs.14 The presence of H+ as a counter ion to the acetylacetonate anion in ACAC solvent is expected to protonate the TiO2 film resulting not only in shifting of the TiO2 conduction band edge (Ec) positively but also in faster regeneration of oxidised dye, ensuring a current enhancement.

It has been shown that the presence of a potential determining ion, such as a lithium ion, in the electrolyte shifts the conduction band edge (Ec) of TiO2 positively, thereby availing a greater density of acceptor states, resulting in an enhancement in the electron injection efficiency and hence the photocurrent.15,16 To investigate solvent dependent variation in the electron dynamics at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed by varying the applied potential at equal intervals in the vicinity of Voc, from which chemical capacitance–voltage curves were obtained; the results are shown in Fig. 2(a). The chemical capacitance at the TiO2/electrolyte interface in DSSCs reflects the sub-bandgap trap states in TiO2 and the distribution of these states is fixed relative to the TiO2 conduction band. It is known that the acceptor states in TiO2 are primarily composed of sub-bandgap states and the density of available acceptor states shifts in energy with the shift in the conduction band edge of TiO2.17,18 Shown in Fig. 2(a), chemical capacitance follows an exponential rise with increasing applied bias voltage and is characteristic of the nanostructured TiO2 semiconductor. A higher chemical capacitance indicates a positive (downward) shift in the conduction band edge of TiO2.19,20 At the same bias voltage chemical capacitance of TiO2 was found to be much higher without and with addition of TBP to the ACAC based electrolyte compared to that based on ACN. To get further insight into the shift in TiO2 Ec, Mott–Schottky measurements were carried out. Fig. 2(b) displays the flat band potential (EFB) of undyed TiO2 in the presence of different electrolytes as determined by Mott–Schottky measurements. The flat band potential of TiO2 shifted to lower negative potential at −0.59 V in the ACAC based electrolyte (without additive) compared to the ACN based electrolyte (TiO2, EFB −0.69 V). Since the same photoanode is used, the difference in the flat band potential is attributed to the difference in the electrolyte, thus confirming the shift in TiO2 Ec with the change of solvent from ACN to ACAC. With the addition of TBP to the ACAC based electrolyte, the flat band potential is shifted to a lower negative potential at −0.48 V and is attributed to the minimization in space charge layer thickness due to the decrease in oxidized species (triiodide) as explained in the following section.

Shown in Fig. 3(A), a distinct change in colour from dark brownish red for the ACAC based electrolyte to pale yellow with the addition of TBP in ACAC based electrolyte suggests the existence of an interaction between iodine and TBP. Based on literature reports, the above colour change of the iodine solution in ACAC solvent with the addition of TBP may be attributed to TBP reducing the iodine concentration by converting it to a TBP–iodine complex owing to the stronger electron donating ability of TBP to iodine.21 Kebede et al.22 also observed that a strong pyridine–iodine complex formed from a mixture of pyridine and iodine in acetonitrile. It is known that the extent of transformation from the mixture of iodine and iodide to triiodide depends on solvent basicity. Thus, as mentioned earlier, the acidic nature of ACAC favours stronger interaction of iodine with TBP, resulting in a lower triiodide ion concentration. In a liquid electrolyte with a fixed photoanode, dye and counter electrode, the ease of ionic diffusion of a redox couple and its concentration play a significant role in determining DSSC photovoltaic performance. In particular, the lowering of triiodide concentration sets a limit for the maximum short circuit current that can be achieved in a cell.23 To examine the interactions between iodine and TBP in ACAC which may affect the diffusion limited current (Jlim), cyclic voltammetry measurements were carried out on Pt–electrolyte–Pt symmetric cells and the results are shown in Fig. 3(B).

(B): steady-state cyclic voltammograms for Pt–Pt symmetric cells with different electrolytes (scan rate 10 mV s−1). (C): Nyquist plots of the symmetric cells obtained from impedance measurements at 0 V from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz. The inset graph shows a Nyquist plot of ACAC based electrolyte with TBP. 
Without the addition of TBP, the ACAC based electrolyte showed a diffusion limited current (Jlim) significantly higher than the corresponding Jsc, ensuring a sufficient concentration of triiodide that does not limit the short circuit current. In contrast, the additive TBP in the ACAC based electrolyte lessened the Jlim drastically lower than the corresponding Jsc, suggesting that Jsc must be limited to the Jlim value. If we assume a constant diffusion coefficient of triiodide in the absence or presence of TBP in the ACAC based electrolyte, the diffusion limiting current values suggest that the effective concentration of triiodide decreased 6 times compared to the electrolyte without the addition of TBP. The limitation in the diffusion current due to triiodide with the addition of TBP in the ACAC based electrolyte was further confirmed by impedance measurements. Fig. 3(C) displays the Nyquist plots of the symmetric cells, in which the first and the second semicircles are attributed to electron transfer at the Pt/electrolyte interface and Warburg diffusion of triiodide in the electrolyte, respectively.24 The fitted Warburg resistance was found to be 8.4 and 647 Ω without and with the addition of TBP, respectively. The higher Warburg diffusion resistance in the presence of TBP clearly leads to stronger diffusion limitation and is in consensus with the results of steady-state cyclic voltammetry. The impedance at the Pt/electrolyte interface is inversely proportional to the concentration of triiodide ions.25 Quite notably, the first semicircle in the presence of TBP is much larger compared to that in the absence of TBP and is attributed to the severe diminution of triiodide ions. Thus, in the ACAC based electrolyte, the stronger complexation between the electron donating TBP molecule and iodine results in a lowering of the effective concentration of triiodide species, which suppresses the transfer of electrons at the counter electrode leading to decrease in Jsc.
To further confirm the observed reduction in triiodide ions with the addition of TBP to the ACAC based electrolyte, dark current measurements were carried out for DSSCs under reverse bias (positive voltage on TiO2) and the results are shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen that the dark current in a cell without the additive TBP does not saturate well over 45 mA cm−2. However for a cell with the additive TBP, the dark current under reverse bias saturates at much lower current, clearly suggesting a shortage of triiodide ions in the electrolyte. Thus, it can be concluded that the decrease in short circuit current at 1 sun with the addition of TBP is due to the depletion of triiodide species in the electrolyte.

An improvement in efficiency of the device with the ACAC based electrolyte can be envisaged by achieving a higher limiting current density. To alleviate the limitation imposed by TBP in terms of achieving high limiting current density, we explored 8-hydroxyquinoline (8HQ), which contains a nitrogen atom and OH group in its structure and is readily soluble in ACAC. As observed in other studies with the use of nitrogen containing heterocyclic additives, it is expected that use of 8HQ may also enhance Voc.26 As can be seen from Fig. 3(B), the additive 8HQ offered much higher diffusion limited current than the additive TBP. Also, as seen in Fig. 3(A), no change in colour with the addition of 8HQ is observed. The Warburg diffusion resistance with the addition of 8HQ in the ACAC based electrolyte was found to be 17.1 Ω (Fig. 3(C)) which is much lower than that of the electrolyte with the additive TBP. Reverse bias dark current (Fig. 4) with additive 8HQ is also just slightly lower than without any additive, implying that a sufficient concentration of triiodide has been sustained. It is believed that in ACAC, 8HQ is much less susceptible to complexation with iodine than TBP, which can be ascribed to the lower electron donating capacity of 8HQ compared to TBP or to the difference in ionization energies of 8HQ and TBP in ACAC solvent. Considering all these seemingly beneficial characteristics of additive 8HQ, J–V characteristics of the DSSCs were measured and the results are presented in Fig. 5. The device with 8HQ added to the ACAC based electrolyte showed the following photovoltaic parameters; Jsc = 16.52 mA cm−2, Voc = 600 mV and FF = 0.60, yielding a photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 5.96%, clearly showing an increment in current and ∼12% increment in efficiency over that of the device with TBP additive (Table 1).

To clarify further the role of the additive 8HQ in the ACAC based electrolyte on interfacial charge transfer processes, EIS was carried out in the dark at −0.65 V. The EIS spectra exhibit three semicircles as shown in Fig. 6. The extracted parameters from Fig. 6 are listed in Table 2. To exemplify the interfacial charge transfer processes, we focus on the middle frequency semicircle. The additive 8HQ in the ACAC based electrolyte increases Rrec compared to the case without any additive, implying the suppression of charge recombination at the TiO2/electrolyte interface. Furthermore the chemical capacitance (Cμ) of the TiO2/electrolyte interface was found to decrease with the addition of 8HQ, implying a negative shift in the conduction band edge of TiO2. From this we infer that the improvement of Voc with the use of 8HQ originates from the negative shift in the conduction band edge of TiO2 and the suppression of electron recombination at the TiO2/electrolyte interface. However, the electron lifetime τ = CμRrec,27 was found to be higher in the electrolyte without any additive compared to the additive 8HQ, which is attributed to the higher chemical capacitance.

Beside the impact of TBP on triiodide concentration, the impact of ACAC solvent compared to ACN on triiodide concentration needs further investigation. It is believed that though ACAC is more viscous than ACN, the decrease in triiodide concentration may also contribute to lowering the limiting current density of the ACAC based electrolyte compared with the ACN (Fig. 3(B)).
The use of small radius cationic species has been found to be deleterious in maintaining TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface stability due to their intercalation into the titania lattice, as well as penetration into dye multilayers that thereby affects dye desorption in the long term operation of DSSCs leading to a decline in its efficiency.28,29 Considering the beneficial effect of ACAC solvent in terms of enhancing the current density with such a solvent based electrolyte, we propose that the use of small radius cationic species can be avoided, possibly leading to TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface stability in the long term operation of DSSCs.
Conclusion
In this work we have demonstrated acetylacetone as a promising electrolyte solvent for dye sensitized solar cells. Also, it is clearly demonstrated that 8HQ is the preferred choice of additive for acetylacetone instead of TBP. A salient feature of this solvent based electrolyte is its acidic nature that offers higher current density over an acetonitrile based electrolyte. Moreover, this solvent might contribute to the firm attachment of dye on the surface of TiO2 in long term cell operation. From this study we believe that ACAC solvent might be useful to modulate the energy alignment in order to improve the electron injection efficiency of DSSC devices that employ alternative sensitizers with a LUMO level lying below the unmodified TiO2 conduction band edge. It is worth exploring this solvent (ACAC) as an electrolyte medium for other redox couples and testing its long term stability.
