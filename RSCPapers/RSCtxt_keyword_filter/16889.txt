    , Accepted 2nd July 2014First published on 3rd July 2014AbstractFor the purpose of reducing the bandgap of a fluorene-based semiconducting polymer, we introduced a strong electron-donating oxygen atom into fluorene (F) to synthesize benzochromene (BC), which was then polymerized with electron deficient dithienyl benzothiadiazole (DTBT) and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP2T) to afford two low-bandgap polymers, PBCDTBT and PBCDPP2T, respectively. The PBCDTBT-based solar cell exhibits a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.74%, which is much higher than that of the reference polymer (PFDTBT) (2.56%). The higher PCEs of BC-based polymers are mainly attributed to higher JSC, which arises from stronger and broader absorption, higher exciton generation rate, more effective charge separation and higher hole mobility as compared to fluorene-based polymers.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) composed of conjugated copolymers as the donor and fullerene derivatives as the acceptor have extensively been studied for the past decade because of their unique advantages such as low cost, light weight and flexibility.1–5 Recently, remarkable progress has been made in polymer/fullerene BHJ solar cells, demonstrating that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs reaches over 8%.6–11 However, it is still needed to further improve the PSC performance for commercialization. One of the most effective methods to improve the PCE is to develop new donor polymers, which have ideal energy levels and planar structures as well as good solubility in organic solvents.
To obtain high short-circuit current (JSC) of PSCs, one must consider several factors: (i) broad and strong light absorption in the active layer,12–16 (ii) efficient charge separation before geminate recombination17–20 and (iii) good charge transport characteristics21–24 of conjugated copolymers. A commonly used strategy to acquire broad and strong absorption in the active layer is to synthesize a low bandgap polymer, consisting of alternating electron-donating and electron-accepting units. It has been known that the charge separation is dependent upon the dipole moment change of donor polymer from the ground state to the excited state (Δμge).17–20 As proposed by Yu17,18 and other groups,19,20 a large value of Δμge suppresses geminate recombination and facilitates charge separation. Another approach to improve JSC is to incorporate a planar molecular unit into the polymer backbone, which may enhance electron delocalization and promote cofacial π–π stacking, thus benefitting charge transport in the PSC device. To precisely control the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of the donor polymer and thus to improve the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of PSCs,25,26 alternating conjugated copolymers composed of weak electron-donating and strong electron-accepting units have been developed.27–33
Among various semiconducting polymers for PSCs, a copolymer consisting of fluorene as an electron-donating unit and benzothiadiazole as an electron-accepting unit, poly{9,9-bis-alkylfluorene-2,7-diyl-alt-[4,7-bis-(thien-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothia-diazole]-5′,5′′diyl} (PFDTBT), exhibits a high VOC of around 1 V because of its deep HOMO energy level, but it shows relatively low PCEs with moderate JSCs due to a large bandgap of 1.9 eV. The other critical issue of the PFDTBT-based polymer is the solubility in organic solvent. Previously, it has been reported that bis-octyl-substituted PFDTBT has poor solubility, and therefore only a low average molecular weight (Mn = ∼5k) of the polymer was obtained, which leads to a low PCE of 2%.34,35 Therefore, other PFDTBTs with longer and branched side chains such as decyl36 (Mn = 17k), 2-ethylhexyl (Mn = 21k) and 3,7-dimethyloctyl35 (Mn = 20k) were synthesized, and the devices based on these polymers showed higher PCEs of 4.0–4.5% due to better solubility and higher molecular weight. However, the JSCs of the devices are still moderate (7.0–9.0 mA cm−2) probably because of a large bandgap.
Another electron accepting unit that has attracted significant interest in the past few years is thiophene-capped diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP2T), which exhibits intense absorption at long wavelength and good field effect mobilities.12,22 Recently, the Janssen group37 synthesized a copolymer (PFDPP2T) consisting of DPP2T and fluorene, and utilized the copolymer in the photovoltaic device. Although the PFDPP2T-based device shows a high VOC of ∼0.9 V due to its deep HOMO energy level, the polymer affords a low PCE of 0.9% with a low JSC of 2.41 mA cm−2. One of the reasons for the low JSC is probably a large bandgap of 1.79 eV, which is a common problem of the fluorene-based polymer.
In this study, we introduce an oxygen atom into a bis-octyl-substituted fluorene unit in order to develop a new electron-donating unit, benzochromene (BC). BC was then polymerized with an electron-accepting unit, dithienyl benzothiadiazole (DTBT) or DPP2T to synthesize two low bandgap polymers (PBCDTBT and PBCDPP2T) (see Scheme 1). Since the electron-donating ability of BC is stronger than fluorene, it is expected that the BC-based polymers (PBCDTBT and PBCDPP2T) exhibit narrower bandgaps than the corresponding fluorene-based polymers (PFDTBT and PFDPP2T), respectively, by raising their HOMO energy level. BC-based polymers are also expected to have better solubility due to the regio-random molecular structure in the backbone and higher Mn than the corresponding fluorene-based polymer. The best device based on PBCDTBT exhibits a promising PCE of 5.74% with a JSC of 12.51 mA cm−2, which is two times higher than the JSC of PFDTBT (6.35 mA cm−2). The PBCDPP2T-based device also shows higher PCE (2.01%) with higher JSC (5.79 mA cm−2) than those of the PFDPP2T-based device (PCE = 0.95% and JSC = 2.79 mA cm−2).

When the UV-Visible spectra of PFDTBT and PBCDTBT are compared, as shown in Fig. 1a, PBCDTBT absorbs more photons in the range of 550–700 nm with higher molar extinction coefficient (εmax) than PFDTBT. Furthermore, PBCDTBT exhibits a strong vibronic shoulder in solution, indicating that PBCDTBT is significantly aggregated in the solution state. When the UV-Visible spectra of two polymers in the film state are compared, as shown in Fig. 1b, it reveals that PBCDTBT exhibits higher εmax and broader absorption than PFDTBT. Thus, it is easily expected that more excitons are generated in PBCDTBT than in PFDTBT when they are exposed to light. Since a strong vibronic shoulder appears in the film of PBCDTBT while the PFDTBT film does not exhibit the vibronic shoulder, it is concluded that PBCDTBT has a more ordered structure than PFDTBT in the solid state. When the optical bandgap (Eoptg) of PBCDTBT is estimated from the absorption edge of the thin film, the Eoptg of PBCDTBT (1.77 eV) is slightly lower than that of PFDTBT (1.81 eV). The two absorption bands of PBCDTBT are red-shifted in both solution and film state as compared to PFDTBT. PBCDPP2T also shows lower Eoptg (1.64 eV) with higher εmax than that of PFDPP2T (1.73 eV), because the electron-donating power of BC is stronger than fluorene.

When the electrochemical properties of polymers are studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV), as shown in Fig. 2, the HOMO energy levels of PBCDTBT (−5.28 eV) and PBCDPP2T (−5.31 eV) are higher than those of PFDTBT (−5.43 eV) and PFDPP2T (−5.55 eV), respectively. This is easily understood because the electron-donating power of BC in PBCDTBT and PBCDPP2T is stronger than that of fluorene in PFDTBT and PFDPP2T. It should be noted here that the strong electron-donating unit in a donor polymer raises the HOMO energy level. Since the LUMO energy levels of PFDTBT, PBCDTBT, PFDPP2T and PBCDPP2T are −3.62 eV, −3.51 eV, −3.82 eV and −3.67 eV, respectively, as listed in Table 1, the LUMO–LUMO offsets between the donor polymers and PC71BM (−4.2 eV) are larger than 0.3 eV, which are sufficient for effective exciton dissociation.38,39

When the solar cell performances are measured with the conventional device structure, as shown in Fig. 3a, the best device based on PBCDTBT exhibits a promising PCE of 5.74% with a JSC of 12.51 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.87 V and a FF of 52% while PFDTBT shows a PCE of 2.56% with a JSC of 6.35 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.94 V and a FF of 43%. Another BC-based polymer, PBCDPP2T, also shows higher PCE (2.01%) than that of the fluorene-based counterpart, PFDPP2T (0.95%). Here, the devices with fluorene-based polymers were optimized by following the method reported in the literature35,37 while the devices with BC-based polymers were optimized by varying the blend ratio of polymer to PC71BM, the mixing ratio of solvents and the amount of DIO additive. Since the VOC is proportional to the energy difference between the LUMO energy level of PC71BM and the HOMO energy level of the donor polymer, it is reasonable that the VOCs of PFDTBT (0.94 V) and PFDPP2T (0.91 V) are higher than those of PBCDTBT and PBCDPP2T, respectively, considering that the HOMO energy levels of fluorene-based polymers are deeper than those of BC-based polymers. Although the VOC is sacrificed to some extent upon introduction of oxygen into the fluorene unit, the JSCs of PBCDTBT (12.51 mA cm−2) and PBCDPP2T (5.79 mA cm−2) are two times larger than those of PFDTBT (6.35 mA cm−2) and PFDPP2T (2.84 mA cm−2), respectively, which can be further identified by comparing the external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of the four polymers as blended with PC71BM (Fig. 3b). Integration of EQE spectra of PFDTBT, PBCDTBT, PFDPP2T and PBCDPP2T blends yields JSC = 6.11 mA cm−2, JSC = 11.86 mA cm−2, JSC = 2.61 mA cm−2 and JSC = 5.49 mA cm−2, respectively, which are nearly consistent with the JSC values obtained from J–V measurement.

Three factors may be considered for higher JSC of the BC-based polymer solar cell: molecular weight, UV-Vis absorption and blend morphology. First, a high molecular weight of the donor polymer is beneficial for effective charge transport, because it may facilitate formation of a bicontinuous phase structure.40 To examine the effect of molecular weight on photovoltaic properties, we synthesized two PFDTBTs with different molecular weights (8.3k and 19.0k) and compared their solar cell performances. The best device based on PFDTBT with Mn = 19.0k shows a PCE of 2.56% with JSC = 6.35 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.94 V and FF = 0.43, while the device based on lower molecular weight PFDTBT (Mn = 8.3k) exhibits a PCE of 2.29% with JSC = 6.11 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.94 V and FF = 0.40 (Fig. S3†), indicating that the molecular weight does not strongly affect the photovoltaic properties when the molecular weight exceeds 8.3k. It has also been reported that the photovoltaic properties of PFDTBT are saturated when Mn > 10k.41 Second, strong and broad light absorption is also an important factor for achieving high JSC. The stronger and broader light absorption of PBCDTBT and PBCDPP2T contributes to larger JSC than PFDTBT and PFDPP2T, respectively (Fig. 1). Third, the morphology of the polymer:PCBM blend is also a critical factor to control JSC. Since the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of BC-based polymer blends exhibit nanoscale phase separation with a fibril-like network structure while fluorene-based polymer blends show coarser morphology with larger domain sizes (Fig. 4), it is expected that the BC-based polymer blends are more effective for both charge separation and charge transport.42

To analyze the effect of oxygen atom in PBCDTBT and PBCDPP2T on PSC device performance in more detail, we determined the maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax) and exciton dissociation probability (P(E,T)) of the four polymers according to the method previously reported,43,44 and compared them with each other. Fig. 5a shows the dependence of photocurrent density (Jph) on effective voltage (Veff). Here Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current density under illumination at 100 mW cm−2 and dark conditions, respectively, and Veff is defined as Veff = V0 − Va, where V0 is the voltage at the point of Jph = 0 and Va is the applied bias voltage. Since it can be assured that all of photogenerated excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers at high Veff due to sufficient electric field,45 the Gmax can be determined from the saturation current density (Jsat): Jsat = qGmaxL, where q is the electronic charge and L is the thickness of the active layer. When the value of Gmax is calculated from the above relation and Fig. 5a, the value of Gmax for PBCDTBT (8.55 × 1027 m−3 s−1 with Jsat = 115 A m−2) is larger than that of PFDTBT (5.66 × 1027 m−3 s−1 with Jsat = 77 A m−2). This is probably because PBCDTBT shows higher εmax and broader absorption than PFDTBT. The exciton dissociation probability (P(E,T)), which is a function of the electric field (E) and temperature (T), can also be determined from the relation Jph = qGmaxP(E,T)L. Fig. S5a† shows a plot of P(E,T) against Veff, where the dashed-line indicates Veff and the corresponding P(E,T) under short-circuit conditions. The P(E,T) values of PFDTBT and PBCDTBT under short-circuit conditions are 79% and 85%, respectively, suggesting that excitons photogenerated in PBCDTBT dissociate more efficiently than those in PFDTBT. The DPP-based polymer shows the same result as the BT-based polymer, as shown in Fig. 5b and S5b†: PBCDPP2T exhibits larger Gmax (5.89 × 1027 m−3 s−1) and higher P(E,T) (82%) than those of the fluorene-based counterpart, PFDPP2T (2.42 × 1027 m−3 s−1 and 75%).

It has been reported that the difference between the dipole moment from ground state to excited state (Δμge) in conjugated polymers largely affects the device performance of PSCs.17–20 Since a large value of Δμge in the donor polymer makes the excited state highly polarized, it facilitates electron transfer from donor polymer to acceptor. In other words, Coulombic binding energy of the exciton is reduced by larger Δμge. When the Δμge was calculated for one repeating unit of the four polymers using DFT/TDDFT at B3LYP/6-31G level, the Δμge values of BC-based polymers are larger than the corresponding fluorene-based polymers (see Tables S4 and S5†), indicating that excitons in BC-based polymers are more easily separated into free charge carriers than fluorene-based polymers, which are very consistent with the value of P(E,T).
Another important factor to control JSC is the crystallinity of the donor polymer, because a high crystalline polymer affords efficient charge carrier transport to the electrode after exciton dissociation. When the crystallinities of two polymers are examined by wide angle X-ray diffraction (XRD), as shown in Fig. S6,† the XRD patterns of BC-based two polymers clearly show distinctive Bragg diffraction, while those of fluorene-based polymers do not show a discernible peak,46 indicating that BC-based polymers are highly crystalline whereas fluorene-based polymers are amorphous. To investigate the molecular orientation of the polymers blended with PC71BM, the grazing incident wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) experiments are performed. The PBCDTBT:PC71BM blend clearly shows (100), (200), (300) and (010) diffraction peaks in the qz direction, while the diffraction peaks of (100) and (200) are also observed in the qxy direction, indicating that PBCDTBT has both face-on and edge-on molecular orientation on the substrate. However, the PFDTBT:PC71BM blend does not exhibit discernible diffraction peaks in both qz and qxy directions, indicating amorphous characteristics (Fig. S7†).
To correlate crystallinity to charge transport, the hole mobilities of the four polymers and their blends with PC71BM are measured by the standard method using a single charge carrier device and compared with each other. The space-charge limited current (SCLC) J–V curves were obtained under dark conditions using a hole-only device (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer or polymer:PC71BM/Au), from which the hole mobility was calculated using the Mott–Gurney law (Fig. 6, Table 2 and Fig. S8†). When the hole mobilities of BC-based polymers and their blends with PC71BM are compared with those of fluorene-based polymers and their blends with PC71BM, the hole mobilities of BC-based polymers and their blends are higher than those of fluorene-based polymers and their blends, respectively. Considering that BC-based polymers, PBCDTBT and PBCDPP2T, have higher crystallinity than fluorene-based polymers, PFDTBT and PFDPP2T, the higher hole mobilities of BC-based polymers are attributed to higher crystallinity as compared to fluorene-based polymers. In short, higher JSCs of BC-based polymers arise from larger photon absorption, higher Gmax, more effective charge separation, higher hole mobility and better developed morphology as compared to fluorene-based polymers.

Conclusions
We synthesized a new electron-donating unit, BC, by introducing an oxygen atom into fluorene, which was then polymerized with electron-deficient DTBT and DPP2T, for the purpose of reducing the bandgap and enhancing the solubility of the conjugated polymer. The bandgaps of BC-based polymers, PBCDTBT and PBCDPP2T, are lower than those of fluorene-based counterparts, PFDTBT and PFDPP2T, respectively, due to the introduction of the electronegative oxygen atom in fluorene. Since BC-based polymers exhibit stronger and broader light absorption, higher exciton generation rate as evidenced by larger Gmax, more effective charge generation rate due to larger Δμge and higher mobility due to higher crystallinity than the corresponding fluorene-based counterparts, BC-based polymers show higher JSC than fluorene-based polymers. Particularly, the PSC based on PBCDTBT:PC71BM shows a promising PCE of 5.74% with a JSC of 12.51 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.87 V and a FF of 52%.

Monomer BC (0.11 g, 0.19 mmol) and DPP2T-Bo (0.15 g, 0.19 mmol) were used as monomers, and a dark green solid was obtained as a product (0.12 g, 50%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 9.09 (br, 1H), 7.39 (br, 4H), 4.01 (br, 2H), 1.96 (br, 4H), 1.24 (br, 38H).
Fabrication of photovoltaic cells
The configuration of the solar cell device used in this work is glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al. The ITO-coated glass was cleaned with acetone and isopropyl alcohol. After complete drying at 150 °C for 30 min, the ITO-coated glass was treated with UV–ozone for 15 min. PEDOT:PSS (Clevious AI 4083) was spin-coated on the ITO glass at 4000 rpm for 1 min and annealed at 120 °C for 30 min to obtain a 40 nm thick film. Then, the active layer solution was spin coated onto the PEDOT:PSS-coated ITO glass. After the active layer was dried completely, Ca (20 nm) and Al (100 nm) were thermally deposited as the cathode under 3 × 10−6 Torr. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 4200 source-meter under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) simulated by a Newport-Oriel solar simulator. The photovoltaic properties are reported on average values of 8 devices. The light intensity was calibrated using a NREL certified photodiode and light source meter prior to each measurement. The IPCE was measured using a lock-in amplifier with a current preamplifier under a short circuit current state with illumination of monochromatic light.
Characterization and measurement
The chemical structures of compounds were identified by 1H NMR (Avance DPX-300) and 13C NMR (Avance DPX-500). The molecular weights were measured by size exclusion chromatography (Agilent 1200 GPC) using CHCl3 as an eluent. The absorption spectra were obtained using an UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Lambda 25, Perkin Elmer). Cyclic voltammetry experiments were carried out on a potentiostat/galvanostat (VMP 3, Biologic), where acetonitrile and 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate were used as solvent and electrolyte, respectively. Platinum wires (Bioanalytical System Inc.) were used as both counter and working electrodes, and Ag/Ag+ (Ag in 0.1 M AgNO3 solution, Bioanalytical System Inc.) was used as a reference electrode. The crystallinity of the active layer was investigated using an X-ray diffractometer (M18XHF-SRA, Mac Science Co.) using Cu Kα (λ = 0.154 nm) radiation. GIWAXS scans were obtained at the Advanced Light Source at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The wavelength of X-ray used was 1.240 Å, and the scattered intensity was detected using a PILATUS 1M detector. The thin film morphology was observed by TEM (JEM1010) operating at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV. The thickness of the active layers was measured by atomic force microscopy (Nano Xpert2).
