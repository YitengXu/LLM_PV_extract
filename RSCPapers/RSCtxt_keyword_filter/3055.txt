    , Accepted 3rd June 2016First published on 8th June 2016AbstractUnderstanding the microscopic mechanisms of electronic excitation in organic photovoltaic cells is a challenging problem in the design of efficient devices capable of performing sunlight harvesting. Here we develop and apply an ab initio approach based on time-dependent density functional theory and Ehrenfest dynamics to investigate photoinduced charge transfer in small organic molecules. Our calculations include mixed quantum–classical dynamics with ions moving classically and electrons quantum mechanically, where no experimental external parameter other than the material geometry is required. We show that the behavior of photocarriers in zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) and C60 systems, an effective prototype system for organic solar cells, is sensitive to the atomic orientation of the donor and the acceptor units as well as the functionalization of covalent molecules at the interface. In particular, configurations with the ZnPc molecules facing on C60 facilitate charge transfer between substrate and molecules that occurs within 200 fs. In contrast, configurations where ZnPc is tilted above C60 present extremely low carrier injection efficiency even at longer times as an effect of the larger interfacial potential level offset and higher energetic barrier between the donor and acceptor molecules. An enhancement of charge injection into C60 at shorter times is observed as binding groups connect ZnPc and C60 in a dyad system. Our results demonstrate a promising way of designing and controlling photoinduced charge transfer on the atomic level in organic devices that would lead to efficient carrier separation and maximize device performance.
1. Introduction
Organic photovoltaic solar (OPV) cells aim to provide a low cost alternative to silicon-based solar cells,1–3 since abundant sources, chemical flexibility for modification and easily handling and manufacture allowing their inexpensive large-scale production, make OPV devices a subject that attracts attention. Nevertheless, their relatively low efficiency is one of the major challenges to be overcome. The key strategies to increase efficiency include improving total light absorption by using, for example, heterostructured materials. In such systems, compounds with complementary absorption spectra are combined which induce higher optical densities over a broader spectral range than a single structure.4,5 Another alternative is to design effective donor/acceptor (D/A) interfaces for electron–hole separation. Because excited states or excitons in organic materials present binding energies of several tenths of eV, D/A interfaces can be designed to dissociate excitons into free electrons and holes as an effect of energy offset between the two materials.5 A promising example is the interface formed between C60 and zinc phthalocyanines (ZnPc), which has shown efficiencies as high as 2.2–6.0%.6–8 Such small molecule solar cells producing considerable efficiency have become one of the most extensively studied systems for photovoltaic applications.2,3,9
Recently, some mechanisms have been proposed to understand the effects of local interactions on the rapid charge dissociation in this system and related polymer blends which happens on the femtosecond (10−15 s) timescale.10–13 However, many questions remain concerning the interface, that could be composed of ZnPc molecules in different stacking configurations,14–18 and how covalently bonded groups linking the donor and acceptor units are formed.19,20 Moreover, extracting details of the photoinduced charge transfer step, which is one of the most efficient processes to suppress the Coulombic interactions between excited electron–hole pairs in specific and isolated donor–acceptor units, is not straightforward. Specifically, the microscopic mechanism of charge generation and its detailed steps as well as the role of charge transfer (CT) states in the generation of free carriers has proven to be controversial for many reasons,21 either in terms of the energy transfer provided by the charge transfer process that helps in the separation of CT states, or electron delocalization mediated charge generation in polymer–fullerene interfaces. The high complexity of the samples and lack of methods to characterize the relative molecular orientations of donor and acceptor molecules at the interface14 are limitations to further progress. In this context, a fully ab initio description of the main processes that govern the photoexcited charge transfer steps between C60 and ZnPc, and their derivatives, as well as possible routes to increase photocarrier generation in such organic systems, would have broad implications in the understanding and designing of such organic systems. On a more fundamental level, a coherent description of charge migration from donor to acceptor is important for a general picture of photoinduced processes in OPV materials.
Here, we address the photomediated charge transfer mechanisms in a femtosecond regime of C60 and ZnPc molecular complexes in various geometric configurations, taking into account the effect of functionalization on the C60 surface by different organic groups. Geometric configurations where ZnPc molecules lie flat on C60, the face-on orientation, exhibit larger charge transfer than those where the molecules assume a tilted orientation, the edge-on geometry. The stronger electron polarization at the ZnPc/C60 interface facilitates charge injection from ZnPc into C60 within 220 fs after excitation, which is rapid enough to escape the Coulomb trap where electron and holes form a closely bound interfacial charge transfer state.5 The photoexcitation process for face-on configurations is also eased by an interfacial electric field of ∼90 V μm−1 that is three times larger than that for edge-on geometries. The organic functionalization linking donor and acceptor at the interface plays a crucial role in the increase of charge injection at shorter times. Oxygen or N-methylpyrrolidine groups covalently attached to the acceptor layer remove the tunnelling barrier between both units and open an electronic channel for fast photocarrier transfer. Our results suggest the possibility of engineering different surface functionalization at D/A heterostructures for high organic device efficiency.
2. Results

Fig. 1a shows the molecular structure of the models composed of ZnPc and C60 molecules at D/A heterointerfaces in a photovoltaic setup. We investigated four representative adsorption geometries in which ZnPc is (i) lying down on a C atom at the apex of two hexagons and one pentagon on C60 (labeled La), (ii) standing up above the bridge site between two C atoms of C60 (Sb), and (iii) bound to C60 through two different covalent functionalizations using O adatoms (S1f) or (iv) an N-methylpyrrolidine group (S2f). The latter two configurations, S1f and S2f, are also a class of dyad system where electron donor and acceptor molecules are covalently bound to each other. These atomic configurations are motivated by recent advances in producing atomically precise interfaces where the characterization and interfacial electronic structure have been reported by several experiments and calculations.19,20,22–29 Indeed, recently an experimental correlation between molecular orientation at the donor–acceptor interface and important solar cell parameters, such as short circuit voltage, fill factor, and dissociation rate, has been found. This points to a critical dependence of device performance on its morphological features.14,15 Therefore, we focus on the relative orientation between the molecules in more detail.
 Fig. 1  (a) Molecular geometries for ZnPc and C60 across the donor/acceptor (D/A) interface in a photovoltaic experimental setup. Four different atomic structure are considered where: ZnPc lies down on top of a C60 surface (La); the molecule stays in a standing-up orientation on top of a bridge bond (Sb); a covalent functionalization mediated by O atoms upon carbon surface (S1f); similar to S1f but using a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of azomethine ylides radical (S2f). (b) Photoinduced charge transfer process in an Sb D/A interface. Photoabsorption on ZnPc promotes an electron from its ground state to an excited state that is injected into the acceptor C60 over a transition state barrier. 
To understand charge separation at the D/A heterointerface (Fig. 1b), we first analyze the electronic structure of each molecular configuration at the ground state. Fig. 2a shows the calculated total density of states (TDOS) as a function of energy for La, Sb, S1f and S2f systems as well as the isolated C60 and ZnPc molecules at the LDA level (see Methods for details). With the adsorption of ZnPc on top of C60, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the isolated systems, which was roughly at the same energy position (bottom of Fig. 2a), was split by values in the range of 0.42–0.69 eV. This stabilizes the individual HOMOs of C60 and ZnPc to lower and higher energies, respectively, pinning the states of the phthalocyanine molecule at the Fermi level of the combined system (Fig. 2b). Similar behavior is observed for the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), which is mainly composed of C60 character. This is a common feature observed for each heterostructure with minor changes when chemical functionalization, as in S1f and S2f, is included. In these two situations, states with character from the organic radical that bridges C60 and ZnPc at the same molecular unit gives a contribution to the HOMO and LUMO which modifies the initial degeneracy observed for the fullerene states (Fig. 2a). These bridge states reduce the energy offset between the LUMOs at the D/A interface (Fig. 2b) by as much as 0.47–0.58 eV in comparison with La and Sb configurations and offer well aligned carrier channels for electron–hole separation, as discussed in more detail later.
 Fig. 2  (a) Calculated total density of states (TDOS) as a function of energy (in eV) of C60 (faint red) and ZnPc (faint blue) molecules at the configurations La, Sb, S1f and S2f at the ground state. For clarity, curves for different D/A combinations have been shifted and smoothed with a Lorentzian broadening of 0.100 eV. The Fermi level is set to zero. The major contributions of each molecule, that is C60 and ZnPc, on each interface around the Fermi level is marked by the vertical bars coloured blue and red. (b) Energy level diagrams (eV) showing the main states involved in the photoexcitation dynamics at the donor (ZnPc) and acceptor (C60) heterointerfaces. The HOMO and LUMO states are marked by solid lines using the labeling in (a). The corresponding transition between the HOMO and LUMO for the ZnPc molecule (eΓ–Γ) is shown by means of the vertical arrows. At La, a scheme of the charge separation process at the D/A interface is shown (see the text). (c) Optical conductivity σ (in 104 Ω−1 m−1) as a function of the frequency ω (in eV) of the four configurations of the ZnPc molecule on top of C60 using the same colors as in (a). The eΓ–Γ transition is marked by a strong peak at around ∼1.35–1.51 eV. 
We have also explicitly checked the possible limitations of the exchange and correlation functional utilized in the chemical description of the energy levels shown in Fig. 2b. We have performed simulations taking into account a fractional component of the exact exchange from Hartree–Fock (HF) theory hybridized with the DFT exchange–correlation functional at the level of the HSE06 hybrid functional30 (see Methods) as shown in Fig. 1S in the ESI.† We note that the overall description of the energy alignment presented in Fig. 2a is still consistent with higher levels of accuracy giving a fairly satisfactory representation of the interactions at the interface. It is important to remark, however, that quantitative differences in the orbital energies as large as 0.60 eV are present as most of the energies calculated using LDA are underestimated relative to HSE06. This suggests that the inclusion of Fock exchange is an important component in energy level alignment between the molecules once the interface is created. The excitation energy between HOMO and LUMO at ZnPc (eΓ−Γ) also keeps a roughly constant value around ∼1.41 eV for the different heterojunctions as shown in Fig. 2c. This generates a well defined peak in the optical conductivity σ (in 10 4 Ω−1 m−1) obtained in response to light with an electric field polarized along the molecular plane of the ZnPc molecule. This means that despite the different chemical configuration between ZnPc and C60 the underlying optical response presents similar features.
The different energy alignment between ZnPc and C60 molecular orbitals has its origin in the interfacial electrical dipole moment. Once the molecules stabilize the interface a net dipole as high as 1.10 D, 0.70 D, 0.82 D and 3.60 D for the molecular configurations La, Sb, S1f and S2f, respectively, is formed. This generates a potential energy step across the interface that pulls up the ZnPc molecular orbitals relative to the carbon cage. The magnitude of the calculated dipole moments is consistent with the LUMO energy offset between ZnPc and C60 band diagrams. The larger the interfacial dipole moment, the smaller the offset between the ZnPc and C60 LUMOs (Fig. 2b). This is in agreement with photoemission spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy measurements performed on a similar structures involving CuPc and C60 interfaces deposited on top of a metallic substrate.28 In the case of S1f and S2f molecular structures, in which the alignment with ZnPc LUMO is mediated by bridge states, the energetic offset also follows this dipole moment rule but at smaller energy differences (∼0.1 eV).
In the following we focus on the excited state carrier dynamics on these ZnPc–C60 interfaces, which play a central role in their photovoltaic applications and daylight harvesting. We simulated this photocarrier dynamics as displayed schematically in Fig. 1b within the framework of the quantum–classical hybrid dynamics employing Ehrenfest dynamics.31,32 We first simulate the initial optical transition eΓ−Γ commented on above (see Fig. 2c) by promoting a valence electron at t = 0 from the HOMO to the LUMO in the first absorption band of ZnPc. This initial electronic structure then evolves with time t > 0 over several femtoseconds within the time-dependent density functional formalism.33 A full time dependent propagation of all the electronic states is performed by solving the time-dependent Kohn–Sham equations for the electrons. Ions are described classically through molecular dynamics based on Newton's classical equations of motion which are coupled to the electronic degree of freedom via the time-dependent electron density (see Methods). The interfacial electron–hole dynamics can be represented by the excess of charge on the acceptor ρD/A (in electrons) which is calculated from the time evolution of the molecular orbital of interest. In this process, two-electron Coulomb coupling of exciton transfer is not taken into account, as direct competition with charge transfer states created at the interface is not the focus of this work.34 We calculate instead an one-by-one electron and hole transfer between the two molecules at the energy limited by their frontier orbitals (HOMO and LUMO). Other theoretical approaches using quantum chemistry methods, such as MS-CASPT2, fragment excitation-difference, and configuration interaction, would be more suitable to be used as the exciton–charge coupling is explicitly included at a considerable computational cost.35–37

Fig. 3 shows that after photoexcitation occurs, there is a considerable electron–hole separation in the La, S1f and S2f configurations but a negligible charge transfer in the Sb molecular geometry. The former three configurations show an electron injection into the acceptor on the time scale of 190–250 fs. These values agree well with those found using time-resolved two-photon photoemission measurements10 and femtosecond time-resolved second harmonic generation.38 We note that the time scale observed for the La, S1f and S2f geometries is one order of magnitude higher than that present at the edge-on Sb system, which shows substantial modifications of their wavefunction isosurfaces at different times (see the snapshots of selected excitonic state charge distributions in Fig. 3). This is in remarkable agreement with recent spectroscopic measurements and calculations for a different C60-based organic interface39,40 and suggests a general role of the effect of D/A geometry on excited electron–hole dynamics.
 Fig. 3  Time-dependent net charge ρD/A (in electrons) on the C60 molecule for the four D/A atomic arrangements: (a) La, (b) Sb, (c) S1f and (d) S2f. The corresponding injection of electrons and holes into C60 are defined by the black and red symbols, respectively. The excitonic wavefunctions (at ±0.05 e− Bohr−3) at initial (t = 0 fs) and later time (t ≥ 100 fs) are shown in the insets in each panel. Blue and red isosurfaces are positive and negative values of the wavefunctions, respectively. 
Furthermore, the hole dynamics is much slower than that of the excited electron and is observed only at times when the excited electron is at least half transferred, ρD/A ∼ 0.5 electrons, to the C60 molecule. This effect is observed clearly for the S1f configuration (Fig. 3c) at t = 185 fs, which shows a 10 times increase of the hole contribution in comparison with earlier evolution times. This suggests that electron–hole interaction could play a role in the hole transfer into the acceptor due to the finite size of the molecule. We also observed that the amount of photoexcited carriers transferred to the C60 molecule is enhanced for the S1f and S2f configurations in comparison with La and Sb. At t = 250 fs, the excited electron is completely injected into the acceptor for the two functionalized structures, indicating that a faster electron–hole dissociation process occurs through the binding groups that covalently link donor and acceptor. This is in agreement with optical measurements performed for phthalocyanine–fullerene dyad compounds that have shown efficient photoinduced electron transfer in covalent ZnPc–C60 systems.41–46
It is worth mentioning that charge transfer occurring on the 200 fs timescale is significantly faster than the exciton lifetime for the ZnPc–C60 interface as recently measured using transient absorption and time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy.22 Therefore, even the very slowest configuration presented in this work, that is Sb, would still out-compete exciton recombination. One of the major photophysical factors that limits device performance is the recombination of free carriers.17,47–49 Both recombination and charge transport/extraction (not studied here) from the photovoltaic device that compete on the microsecond timescale are very sensitive to small changes in recombination lifetime.5 The specific geometrical and electronic structure that assists exciton dissociation is observed in our calculations to induce modifications on the Coulombic interactions of the excited electron–hole pairs. The consequent transport of the light-excited carriers from the D/A interface to the electrodes (anode and cathode), which may also depend on the proper geometry of the electron and hole transport layer, still remain elusive, since no donor-to-donor interactions at the excitation level (interfacial charge transfer state)10 have been taken into account in our model due to the many-body nature of the electron–hole interactions.
The main differences observed in the excited dynamics of the different molecular structures can be understood through the interfacial level alignment as discussed above and the total potential as shown in Fig. 4. At molecular structures where the donor ZnPc component is not fixed to the acceptor C60, that is, the La and Sb systems, an energetic barrier (Δ) of Δ1 ∼ 1.40 eV and Δ2 ∼ 2.05 eV, respectively, prevents the electron tunnelling from ZnPc to C60 at the ground state (Fig. 4a and b). Once the system is photoexcited by the energy needed to generate the optical transition eΓ−Γ from the HOMO to LUMO of ZnPc (Fig. 2) the excited electron has enough energy to overcome that barrier, and in the case of La configuration, an electron transfer is observed. For the Sb geometry, the higher barrier in comparison to the La configuration and the larger energy offset between the LUMO states at the D/A interface (see Fig. 2b) suppresses photocarrier injection into the C60 acceptor at the excitation energy utilized. The Sb configuration is also the most unlikely to be observed in interfaces as recently measured by ion mass spectrometry.28 Moreover, the photoexcitation process at the face-on La configuration is eased by an interfacial electric field of ∼90 V μm−1 that is three times bigger than that at edge-on geometries. Interfacial electric-field driven photoinduced charge transfer at similar systems has recently been measured using femtosecond time-resolved second harmonic generation which is in close agreement with our results.38
 Fig. 4  Total average potential cross section for the different configurations between C60 and ZnPc: (a) La, (b) Sb, (c) S1f and (d) S2f. The chosen path along which the average was performed is shown by the dashed line in the inset above every potential. The vacuum level (EVac) and the Fermi level (EFermi) are marked by the horizontal solid and dashed lines, respectively. The energetic barriers Δ1,2 in (a) and (b) are shown by the vertical arrows in relation to EFermi. 
Photoexcitation electron transfer is also efficient in covalently functionalized ZnPc–C60 structures, e.g. S1f and S2f, as discussed above but with the main advantage that a barrierless potential exists at the D/A interface (Fig. 4c and d). This indicates electronic communication between both molecular units in the ground state similar to that observed in electrochemical characterization.19,50,51 In this regard, the chemical radicals that anchor ZnPc and C60 to the same electroactive unit establish an open channel which enables electron and hole injection into the D/A interface. Indeed, the S1f and S2f configurations show the highest hole transfer (ρD/A ∼ 0.45 electrons at t = 240 fs) among the studied geometries which indicates that if the electron–hole recombination may happen at longer times (not shown here) at the acceptor unit, the efficiency of the solar-cell devices based on this dyad might be rather low. This behavior is in agreement with electrical–optical experiments42 where a low power conversion efficiency was estimated for ZnPc–C60 dyads.
3. Conclusions
We have considered the interplay between photocarrier dynamics and structural and functionalization factors at D/A interfaces as a fundamental issue in the design of efficient organic photovoltaic devices. Our ab initio approximations provide an atomic-scale description of exciton dynamics on the ultrafast time domain in ZnPc–C60 systems, as well as microscopic details of the interfaces that are difficult to extract from experiments, such as the potential barriers. Our results show that configurations where ZnPc molecules lay down on top of C60 carbon structure,52 or binding groups covalently connect ZnPc and C60 in a single electroactive unit, facilitate excited electron injection into the acceptor. The excitation process occurs on a timescale of ∼190–250 fs, which is helped by the lower interfacial energetic barriers of face-on geometries and barrierless behavior for functionalized heterojunctions. Covalent functionalization improves photoelectron transfer at the interface but at a cost of increasing unwanted hole transfer due to the electronic coupling between donor and acceptor. This functionalization effect based on the tuning of the interfacial potential barriers that mediate efficient photoinduced carrier dynamics adds an additional degree of freedom in the understanding and design of organic interfaces for sunlight harvesting, which may guide new avenues of effective electron–hole separation mediated by engineering chemical groups at an interface.
4. Methods
The simulations reported here are based on density functional theory calculations using the SIESTA method53 and VASP code.54,55 The localized density approximation56 along with non-local van der Waals density functional for the exchange–correlation term57 have been used. A double-ζ polarized basis set in SIESTA, and a well-converged plane wave cutoff of 400 eV in VASP were utilized in the calculations. The projected augmented wave method (PAW)58,59 for the latter, and norm-conserving Troullier–Martins pseudopotentials60 for the former, have been used in the description of the bonding environment at the different geometrical configurations between C60 and ZnPc molecules. Atomic coordinates were allowed to relax until the forces on the ions were less than 0.04 eV Å−1 under the conjugate gradient algorithm. Further relaxation (0.01 eV Å−1) does not appreciably change the energetics and geometries.
To avoid any interactions between supercells in the non-periodic direction, a 15 Å vacuum space was used in all calculations. In addition to this, a cutoff energy of 150 Ry was used to resolve the real space grid used to calculate the Hartree and exchange–correlation contributions to the total energy. A basis set of numerical atomic orbitals obtained from the solution of the atomic pseudopotential at slightly excited states as implemented in the SIESTA53 code was used. We have utilized an energy shift of 50 meV to define the radii of different orbitals. We have also carried out calculations using screened hybrid functionals at the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) level of approach.30 In this approximation part of the short range exchange energy is replaced by a portion of exact Hartree–Fock exchange energy. Here we used HSE06 as an example of a hybrid functional because of its successful applications in solids and molecules,61–63 and because of its less expensive computational cost to treat the slow-decaying long-range part of the exchange interaction in comparison to the PBE0 functional.64
To perform the fully quantum mechanical simulations of the electron–hole dynamics as well as the time evolution of the charge transfer for the different systems, we used a Kohn–Sham (KS) scheme within TDDFT33 using the localized basis set algorithm implemented in SIESTA. The TDDFT is a state-of-the-art first principles approach for the treatment of the linear and nonlinear responses of optical excitations in molecules, clusters and extended systems.65–68 The time-dependent electron density is given by  with the summation running over all occupied states. The evolution of the system is determined by solving the time-dependent KS equation for single-particle orbitals Ψj(r,t): (1)where H is the time-dependent Hamiltonian of the system: (2)where the first term is the kinetic energy of electrons, the second term is the Hartree potential, the third term is electron–ion interaction, the fourth term vxc is the exchange–correlation potential treated at the LDA level, and the fifth term vext is an external perturbation. We considered the external potential due to the light source as vext = −Eext(t)·r, where Eext(t) = A0ẑδ(t) is a short duration external electric field polarized along the z-axis. We have set the value of |Eext| within 0.001–0.01 eV Å−1. Electron–hole excitations are modelled by swapping the occupation of the KS eigenvalues, ΨE+hvj (r,t), involved in the excitation process. This is equivalent to consider vertical transitions from the ground state to an excited state which take place instantaneously at t = 0 by the absorption of a single photon.31,69,70 This is a good approach for the excited states included in a photoexcitation process which has been successfully used in several systems.69,71–73 We find that Γ-point sampling in the Brillouin zone (BZ) is enough to describe the coupling between ionic and electronic degrees of freedom through one-by-one electron and hole transfer at the D/A interface.
We simulate the excited state dynamics by turning on the external potential vext at t = 0, and propagating the occupied KS state ΨjE+hv(r,t) by solving eqn (1) at later times t > 0 with vext = 0. The solution of the KS equation for electrons is given by:32 Ψj(r,t + Δt) = Û(t + Δt,t)Ψj(r,t)(3) (4)where Û and  are the time-evolution and the time-ordering operators, respectively. We can approximate the exponential form of Û(t + Δt,t) using a Crank–Nicolson operator.74 The electronic density is updated self-consistently during the real-time propagation of Ψj(r,t) with a time step of Δt = 0.02419 fs. The total energy is conserved to within 10−5 eV fs−1 per atom giving a variation in the total energy of less than 0.1 eV, which is comparable to errors from other methods. The dynamics of the ions is treated classically within the Ehrenfest method. The ions are allowed to move following classical molecular dynamics under the influence of quantum forces due to the electrons. These forces are derived in the mean-field approximation as the derivatives of the total energy with respect to ionic positions via the Hellmann–Feynman theorem: (5)
In this approximation, ions evolve on an effective potential describing an average over several possible adiabatic energy states which are weighted by their occupation probabilities. After evaluating all the forces on each atom, we carried out a molecular dynamics simulation for the ions with the new ionic position Rl+1 and velocities vl+1 at time tl+1 = (l + 1)Δt are calculated using the Verlet algorithm:75 (6) (7)
The initial velocities at t = 0 are assigned according to the Maxwell–Boltzmann equilibrium distribution at a given temperature of 350 K unless otherwise specified. Both initial ground state and subsequent excited state calculations were performed using the LDA approach as it is consistent with the solution of the Kohn–Sham equations at both levels of the theory, without inclusion of energy differences if a different functional is used in a previous calculation. Indeed, quantitatively capturing charge transfer states with DFT is non-trivial, and different approximations have been used by several groups, for instance, in terms of range-separated hybrid functionals28,76,77 to correctly describe frontier orbitals, ionization potentials, electron affinities in terms of optimally tuned switching parameters. Such an approach has been shown to improve the description of several orbital energies of gas phase molecules important in photovoltaic applications, where agreement with experimental measurements is achievable. However, fully excited state hybrid functional dynamics for systems with hundred of atoms in the unit cell is prohibitive as these calculations are heavily time consuming. The average potential profiles were calculated by averaging the potentials at the points within a cross section along the given axis. An amplitude cutoff of −1 V was used to exclude the vacuum area from the averaging for all profiles.
The calculation of the optical properties was based on the computation of the complex dielectric function ε(ω) = ε1(ω) + iε2(ω), in which the imaginary part ε2(ω) is given by: (8)where the integral is over all k-points in the Brillouin zone (BZ) and the sum runs over all possible pairs of valence |ϕi〉 and conduction |ϕj〉 bands with corresponding eigenvalues Ei and Ej, such that ħωij(k) = Ej − Ei. The electric dipole transition matrix element Wij(k), which represents the transition rate of an electron from state |ϕi〉 to state |ϕj〉, is given by Wij(k) = 〈ϕj(k)|ê·p|ϕi(k)〉, with ê and p being the polarization vector and the momentum operator, respectively. The optical conductivity is given by σ(ω) = (ω/4π)(ε2(ω) − 1).78 We found the dielectric function and optical conductivity to be sufficiently well converged with a mesh of 30 × 30 × 1 k points. A Gaussian broadening of 100 meV was used to plot optical conductivity as a function of frequency.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Molecular geometries for ZnPc and C60 across the donor/acceptor (D/A) interface in a photovoltaic experimental setup. Four different atomic structure are considered where: ZnPc lies down on top of a C60 surface (La); the molecule stays in a standing-up orientation on top of a bridge bond (Sb); a covalent functionalization mediated by O atoms upon carbon surface (S1f); similar to S1f but using a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of azomethine ylides radical (S2f). (b) Photoinduced charge transfer process in an Sb D/A interface. Photoabsorption on ZnPc promotes an electron from its ground state to an excited state that is injected into the acceptor C60 over a transition state barrier.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Calculated total density of states (TDOS) as a function of energy (in eV) of C60 (faint red) and ZnPc (faint blue) molecules at the configurations La, Sb, S1f and S2f at the ground state. For clarity, curves for different D/A combinations have been shifted and smoothed with a Lorentzian broadening of 0.100 eV. The Fermi level is set to zero. The major contributions of each molecule, that is C60 and ZnPc, on each interface around the Fermi level is marked by the vertical bars coloured blue and red. (b) Energy level diagrams (eV) showing the main states involved in the photoexcitation dynamics at the donor (ZnPc) and acceptor (C60) heterointerfaces. The HOMO and LUMO states are marked by solid lines using the labeling in (a). The corresponding transition between the HOMO and LUMO for the ZnPc molecule (eΓ–Γ) is shown by means of the vertical arrows. At La, a scheme of the charge separation process at the D/A interface is shown (see the text). (c) Optical conductivity σ (in 104 Ω−1 m−1) as a function of the frequency ω (in eV) of the four configurations of the ZnPc molecule on top of C60 using the same colors as in (a). The eΓ–Γ transition is marked by a strong peak at around ∼1.35–1.51 eV.	 

 	Fig. 3  Time-dependent net charge ρD/A (in electrons) on the C60 molecule for the four D/A atomic arrangements: (a) La, (b) Sb, (c) S1f and (d) S2f. The corresponding injection of electrons and holes into C60 are defined by the black and red symbols, respectively. The excitonic wavefunctions (at ±0.05 e− Bohr−3) at initial (t = 0 fs) and later time (t ≥ 100 fs) are shown in the insets in each panel. Blue and red isosurfaces are positive and negative values of the wavefunctions, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 4  Total average potential cross section for the different configurations between C60 and ZnPc: (a) La, (b) Sb, (c) S1f and (d) S2f. The chosen path along which the average was performed is shown by the dashed line in the inset above every potential. The vacuum level (EVac) and the Fermi level (EFermi) are marked by the horizontal solid and dashed lines, respectively. The energetic barriers Δ1,2 in (a) and (b) are shown by the vertical arrows in relation to EFermi.
