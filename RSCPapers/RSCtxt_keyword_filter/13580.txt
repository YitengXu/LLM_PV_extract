    , Accepted 24th March 2023First published on 27th March 2023AbstractEmerging perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have evolved rapidly in recent years, and their efficiency has been substantially boosted from the initial 3.8% to certified 25.73% now, showing great application potential. Therefore, they have received extensive attention from both industry and academia. However, there is still a certain gap between this value and its theoretical efficiency. In addition, long-term stability is a major challenge hindering its commercial applications. The modification of the heterojunction interface in PSCs, especially buried interface passivation, is crucial to further improve device efficiency and stability. In this review, the impacts of the morphology, composition, microstructure and other characteristics at the buried interface on PSC performance are systematically investigated. Moreover, proposed strategies and corresponding mechanisms for effective buried interface passivation are summarized, looking forward to further promoting the device performance by providing reference and guidance for designing and developing more effective passivation strategies.
1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved dramatic improvements in efficiency in just over a decade,1–6 showing broad application prospects.7 This is mainly attributed to the excellent optoelectronic properties of perovskite materials, such as tunable band gap,8 high optical absorption coefficient,9,10 small exciton binding energy,11 long carrier diffusion length,12 high carrier mobility,13 relatively balanced electron and hole transfer,14 and easy fabrication. Although power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been boosted to certified 25.73%15 in single-junction devices, there is still a certain gap compared with its theoretical limit.16 Additionally, the device long-term stability has not completely succeeded17 and definitively hinders its commercialization.
When the device short-circuit current density (JSC) closes to the Shockley–Queisser (S–Q) limit, the further increase in PCE mainly depends on the improvement in open circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF),18 which requires effective inhibition of non-radiative recombination in the device.19 The interface of PSCs is involved in all processes of carrier separation, transport, collection, and recombination. Hence, the high trap density at the interface inevitably leads to severe non-radiative recombination and VOC loss.20 Moreover, the perovskite degradation induced by the defects at the interface is the principal reason for the device deterioration.21 Therefore, proper interface regulation between various functional layers in PSCs is vital to further ameliorate the device performance.22
Perovskite morphology and crystallinity significantly influence the device performance.23 Tremendous progress has been achieved through composition engineering and the optimization of the perovskite growth process. Regulating the interface between the perovskite and carrier transporting layer (CTL) is becoming important to further improve the device performance.24 As illustrated in Fig. 1a and b, Jiang et al. employed a phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) solution with an appropriate concentration to reprocess the top surface of the perovskite.5 This decreases the surface roughness from 32 to 24 nm and obviously heals the iodine vacancies on the surface and grain boundaries (GBs), thereby improving the photoluminescence (PL) intensity and carrier lifetime. Accordingly, planar PSCs with a VOC up to 1.18 V and a certified PCE of 23.32% were achieved. Moreover, this strategy effectively alleviates perovskite degradation. Therefore, interface passivation is a simple and effective measure to promote device performance and has become the mainstream for the optimization of PSCs.

Piperazinium iodide (PI) can modulate the terminal groups and chemical environment on the perovskite top surface,25 as shown in Fig. 1c, which effectively heals defects and improves the device performance. PI-treated perovskite shows intensive PL with an intensity about five times greater than that of the reference film, and the carrier lifetime is also significantly enhanced (Fig. 1d), indicating that the energy loss arising from the interfacial non-radiative recombination is significantly inhibited by the effective passivation of lead clusters, uncoordinated halogens, and Pb–I antisites. Compared with the PI molecular one, piperazinium diiodide (PDI) containing only the R2NH2+ group shows an inferior passivation effect, indicating the superiority of multifunctional passivation molecules.
Cyclohexylethylammonium iodide (CEAI) can form a two-dimensional (2D) perovskite intermediate layer that comprises CEA2PbI4 on the perovskite surface, as illustrated in Fig. 1e. The 2D layer effectively passivates the defects at the surface and GBs of the 3D perovskite, resulting in a significant reduction in surface roughness and non-radiative recombination without affecting charge transport.26 Compared with PEAI, the interaction between the cyclohexanes in CEAI is weaker and hence avoids molecular stacking. This is more conducive to forming a uniform film and reducing recombination loss. Moreover, attributed to the intrinsic properties of the 2D perovskites and cyclohexylethyl groups, the device exhibited excellent long-term stability.
As described above, previous studies have primarily concentrated on the modification and passivation of the perovskite upper surface.27–29 However, deep-level traps, such as excessive lead halide, aggregate at the perovskite bottom interface, which causes severe non-radiative recombination.30 As the PCE of PSCs gradually approaches the theoretical limit, it becomes the primary obstacle to further ameliorating the device performance.
This paper discloses the formation mechanism of defects at the buried interface and their influence on device performance. It conducts a comprehensive review of effective buried interface passivation strategies and the specific effects on defect density, perovskite quality, energy band alignment, and charge transfer. It is anticipated that this review can provide useful information and constructive guidelines for exploring more effective passivation strategies, thus further promoting the device performance.
2. Impact of a buried interface on device performance
One of the highlighted advantages of PSCs is that they can be easily prepared using a simple and low-cost solution process at a low temperature.31 This implies that the formation energy of perovskites is low. Thus, associated with the annealing process and rapid crystallization during film fabrication,32 combined with the influence of environmental factors, such as temperature and humidity, numerous defects33 related to FA or I vacancy,34 Pb–I antisite, uncoordinated Pb2+ and lead cluster are introduced at GBs and interfaces of polycrystalline perovskite films. This verifies that the defect density of polycrystalline perovskite is two to three orders of magnitude greater than that of a high-quality monocrystalline film. Moreover, the defect density at the interface is one to two orders of magnitude higher than that of the interior,35 as depicted in Fig. 2a–d. Therefore, healing defects through effective interface passivation is essential to improve the device performance. In addition, by measuring the spatial trap distribution in PSCs with the structure of ITO/PTAA/perovskite/C60/BCP/Cu utilizing the drive-level capacitance profiling (DLCP) method, it is found that the defect density near the PTAA/perovskite interface is greater than that around the C60/perovskite interface (Fig. 2b). This surprisingly indicates that the defect density near the bottom interface is significantly higher than that of the top interface. Hence, a comprehensive study on the basic properties of buried interfaces in PSCs is necessary to further improve device performance.

However, as the buried interface is sandwiched between functional layers, it brings technical difficulties to characterize directly with existing technology.36 Yang et al. proposed a simple lift-off process,37 in which a PTAA transporting layer dissolvable in chlorobenzene (CB) was coated on the ITO substrate as a sacrificial layer for lift-off. Then, the perovskite film was fabricated above, followed by a copper capping layer to ensure the toughness of the polycrystalline film during the lift-off process. Perovskite/copper film could separate from the ITO substrate after soaking in CB for 20 minutes at room temperature, which was then transferred onto the substrate and exposed to the bottom interface, as illustrated in Fig. 2e. Subsequently, the relationship between the microstructure of the buried interface and device performance is established based on systematic characterization and evaluation. It is found that the morphology and surface potential of the perovskite top and bottom interfaces distinctly differed. The top surface is uniform with smaller lead halide particles at GBs, whereas large flaky lead halide ones are identified on the buried interface, as shown in Fig. 2f and g. In addition, A-site cations are unevenly distributed, and the ([I] + [Br])/[Pb] ratio is 2.32 on the buried interface, which obviously deviates from the stoichiometric ratio compared with 2.81 of the top surface. Multiscale inhomogeneity ultimately leads to more defects and severe non-radiative recombination at the buried interface. Therefore, submicroscopic-scale extended defects and lead halide inhomogeneity at the buried interface are the main reasons for the device degradation. Introducing moderate PbI2 to adjust the stoichiometric ratio on a buried interface can improve the interface quality to a certain extent.38 However, excess PbI2 conversely deteriorates device performance. Therefore, a more effective strategy for buried interface passivation is preferred.
Holes with ten to hundreds of nanometers are detected on the buried interface of both MAPbI3 and MA–FA hybrid perovskite films after peeling off from the substrate,39 as shown in Fig. 3a. This causes charge accumulation and recombination and triggers various perovskite decomposition processes, thereby accelerating the device deterioration under illumination. Introducing high-boiling point dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) into the precursor solution can regulate the perovskite crystallization process, resulting in the improved film morphology and quality commonly employed in the fabrication process of almost all high-efficiency perovskite solar cells. The solvent evaporates and escapes from the film surface during the fabrication; therefore, a solid shell is rapidly formed,40 which in turn temporarily confines about 10% of DMSO at the film bottom. Remnant DMSO eventually escaped from the film, especially after annealing, causing the collapse of film volume and introducing holes at the buried interface, as shown in Fig. 3b. Accordingly, solid carbohydrazide (CBH) was employed as an additive to partially replace DMSO, which can form stable coordination with Pb cations through CO bonds and remain in perovskite film without evaporation during the later annealing process. Therefore, CBH can avoid volume shrinkage and hole formation at the buried interface. It functions as a reducing agent to inhibit the generation of harmful I2 in perovskites. Finally, PSCs with a PCE of up to 23.6% were achieved combined with superior process repeatability and stability.

Moreover, buried CTLs significantly affect device performance. TiO2 (ref. 42) and SnO2 (ref. 6) are typical electron transporting materials (ETMs) adopted in normal structured PSCs, and the corresponding PCE has exceeded 25%. However, devices based on TiO2 show obvious J–V hysteresis and relatively poor ultraviolet (UV) stability because of its photocatalytic activity.43 The high-temperature sintering involved in TiO2 preparation hinders the achievement of flexible devices and elevates costs.44
In contrast, SnO2 is recognized as a more promising ETM45 with high light transmittance46 originating from the wide bandgap of ∼3.6 eV47 and electron mobility as high as ∼240 cm2 V−1 s−1.48 Additionally, it exhibits superior chemical stability even when prepared using the solution method at low temperatures.49 However, numerous defects are introduced during the preparation.50 As shown in Fig. 3c, SnO2 surface defects mainly include dangling bonds and two kinds of hydroxyl groups.41 Dangling bonds can easily absorb O2 and H2O in the atmosphere, and the absorbed oxygen captures electrons from the SnO2 conduction band and converts them into O−, O2− or O2−, forming a potential barrier and hindering electron transport.51 The hydroxyl groups include alkaline hydroxyl connected with Sn and acid one bridged on two metal sites. These surface defects lead to severe non-radiative recombination, disturb the interfacial interactions, and affect the perovskite quality. SnO2 internal defects are mainly caused by Sni, VO and Oi, VSn,52 and external defects are related to the doping of impurity elements. These defects easily cause carrier recombination, impede electron extraction and collection, and affect the device stability.53 Furthermore, the energy level mismatch between SnO2 and perovskite also hinders the efficient extraction and transfer of photogenerated electrons.54 Therefore, it is essential to optimize the buried CTL to further improve device performance.
3. Passivation strategies for the buried interface
As mentioned above, a high density of defects, especially deep-level defects, can induce severe carrier recombination at the buried interface,55 which also accelerates perovskite degradation, particularly when light is injected from the buried interface.56 In addition, appreciable strain appears at the interface if physical properties,57 such as thermal expansion coefficient,58 lattice constant59 and temperature gradient, between the CTL and perovskite differ,60 promoting the formation of interface defects, carrier transporting barriers, and ion migration, which, in turn, results in the device degradation.61 Moreover, energy level alignment at the interface influences the carrier extraction;62 a large energy level mismatch provides a sufficient potential gradient for carrier extraction but with a drastic energy loss through thermal relaxation and vice versa.63 Therefore, improving the interface performance and healing the defects through systematic modulation of the buried interface with effective strategies are judicious selections to further enhance the device performance.
3.1 Optimization of the buried carrier transporting layer
Ideal buried CTL possesses a suitable energy level matching well with the perovskite,54 guaranteeing sufficient light transmission64 and promoting the generation and extraction of photogenerated carriers.65 Additionally, high carrier mobility and conductivity are indispensable for facilitating carrier transport and suppressing charge accumulation at the interface.66 Moreover, a hydrophilic surface is expected to form good contact with perovskite, which is essential to improve perovskite quality and prevent non-radiative recombination.
However, defects are unavoidable in CTL, which reduces conductivity and causes additional recombination loss. The wettability and roughness of the CTL surface significantly influence the defect density and perovskite crystallinity.67 In addition, energy level mismatch between the CTL and perovskite results in charge accumulation and increased defects,68 inducing J–V hysteresis69 and degradation of device performance.70 Accordingly, numerous strategies have been developed, including surface passivation,71 additives introduction,72 and interfacial treatment, as presented in Table 1.

Ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) can modify SnO2,76 as shown in Fig. 4a, which donates an electron lone pair to the unoccupied d-orbitals of transition metal atoms. Hence, SnO2 reacts to form five-membered ring chelates after EDTA aqueous solution treatment, as shown in Fig. 4b. The EDTA-complexed SnO2 electron transport layer (ETL) (E-SnO2) depicts a more matched energy level arrangement with perovskite (Fig. 4d) and improved electron mobility from 9.92 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 2.27 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. 4e), which promotes the charge extraction and transfer at the interface, distinctly suppressing the J–V hysteresis in the device. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 4c, the E-SnO2 surface is more hydrophilic, which improves the perovskite quality with greater grain size, fewer defects, and better crystallinity, by reducing the Gibbs free energy of heterogeneous nucleation. Consequently, carrier recombination and the degradation of perovskites can be significantly suppressed. PSCs with a laboratory PCE of 21.60% (certified efficiency of 21.52%) were achieved, which was the highest value for planar PSCs at that time. Furthermore, the unencapsulated device shows good stability with a slight PCE reduction of 8% after 2880 hours of storage in the atmosphere.

Stemming from the interaction with acetic acid,75 the conductivity of SnO2 ETL is significantly improved, as shown in Fig. 4f and g, thus enhancing the charge extraction and inhibiting charge accumulation at the interface. Therefore, the hysteresis factor of the device decreases from 0.073 to 0.048. In addition, acetic acid post-treatment can effectively inhibit the non-radiative recombination at the buried interface by passivating the defects on the SnO2 surface, as illustrated in Fig. 4h. The film quality of the perovskite fabricated above is also improved with larger grain size and higher crystallinity. Triple cation hybrid PSCs with an efficiency of 20.56% were finally obtained, and the unpackaged device maintained 73.8% of the initial PCE after 30 days of storage at 25 ± 2.5 °C and 40 ± 5% relative humidity.
TMA+ and Cl− of tetramethylammonium chloride (TMACl) can simultaneously passivate the oxygen vacancies on the SnO2 surface,73 thus significantly suppressing the interfacial defects and carrier recombination, as illustrated in Fig. 5b–d. Moreover, TMACl treatment enhances SnO2 conductivity and accelerates its work function, thereby providing a more matched energy level alignment with CsPbI2Br and accelerating carrier extraction and transport, as shown in Fig. 5e. Inorganic PSCs with an efficiency of up to 13.84% were achieved (Fig. 5a), and the unencapsulated device retained 68% of the initial PCE after 96 hours of storage in the atmosphere with a humidity of 35%. Additionally, 90% of the initial efficiency can be maintained after steady heating at 85 °C for 100 hours in an N2 atmosphere, showing excellent humidity and thermal stress stability.

Hence, as a prerequisite, the optimization of buried CTL is essential to further improve the device performance, and extra attention is needed in future studies.
3.2 Passivation strategies at buried interfaces through ion diffusion
The crystalline quality of perovskite determines the carrier mobility and diffusion length, so a uniform and dense film with large grains is preferred to mitigate energy loss. Additionally, numerous defects parasitic in the interior, surface, and grain boundaries of perovskite,79 especially prepared with the solution process, can introduce states in the bandgap of perovskite,80 which reduces carrier extraction efficiency and accelerates film degradation assisted with oxygen and moisture.81 Moreover, energy barriers introduced between mismatched functional layers impede carrier transport, resulting in large VOC and energy loss.82
It has been verified recently that specific ions, such as halogen ions Cl−, F−,83 alkali ions Na+, K+,84 and Cs+ as well as other ions Eu3+, SO42−, CO32−, and S2−,85 introduced at the buried interface diffuse into the buried CTL and perovskite, respectively. This exhibited great potential to inhibit ion migration, heal defects, enhance perovskite crystallization, and optimize the energy band alignment of the device. This, in turn, alleviates the energy loss in the device and eliminates J–V hysteresis. Table 2 summarizes representative passivation strategies at the buried interface through ion diffusion, listing the corresponding device structures and specific photovoltaic parameters.

Zhu et al. directly introduced KCl into SnO2 colloidal solution and prepared SnO2–KCl composite ETL,92 as shown in Fig. 6a. The spatial distribution of the elements shown in Fig. 6b indicates that K+ mainly accumulates at the SnO2/perovskite interface and can diffuse partially into the perovskite GBs. Hence, it can simultaneously passivate the defects at SnO2/perovskite interface and perovskite GBs and significantly suppress the non-radiative recombination. Furthermore, K+ and Cl− at the buried interface promote the contact between ETL and perovskite and enlarge the perovskite grain size.96 Consequently, the ETL and hole transport layer (HTL) can be directly connected with a single grain, facilitating charge transport. PSCs with PCE as high as 22.2% were achieved, where the VOC was substantially increased by 60 mV to 1.137 V.

Most Eu3+ ions aggregate at the SnO2/perovskite interface, while some can diffuse from SnO2 into the perovskite interior owing to the guidable transfer of Eu3+, as illustrated in Fig. 6d and e. With the synergetic passivation effect of Eu3+ collected at the SnO2/perovskite interface and dispersed in SnO2, the electron mobility of SnO2 is considerably improved by eight times, associated with enhanced charge transfer and suppressed interfacial loss. Moreover, Eu3+ diffused in perovskite combined with this at the interface heals the lead- and iodine-related defects at the perovskite GBs, thereby improving the device FF. Furthermore, doped Eu3+ can elevate the quasi-Fermi level of electrons. The resulting larger quasi-Fermi level splitting enhances the built-in potential, thereby providing a sufficient driving force for carrier separation and inhibiting recombination. PSCs with an efficiency of 20.14% and enhanced VOC were achieved. In addition, it can retain 87% of the initial efficiency after 84 day storage in the atmosphere probably because Eu3+ aggregated at GBs and interface can stabilize the perovskite by preventing moisture penetration.
CsI incorporated in SnO2 can change the electron density around Sn atoms and reduce the work function of the SnO2 surface by possibly forming an Sn–O–Cs dipole,94 as shown in Fig. 6f, thereby decreasing the energy barrier in the device. It is demonstrated through extensive characterization that Cs can promote vertical growth and improve the crystallinity of perovskite by modulating nucleation. Consequently, photovoltage decay time increased obviously from 29.4 to 92.2 μs, and the defect density in perovskite decreased from 9.67 × 1015 to 4.83 × 1015 cm−3, as illustrated in Fig. 6g, indicating that CsI doping prolongs the carrier lifetime and reduces the non-radiative recombination loss significantly. Simultaneously, the gradient distribution of Cs+ around the buried interface provides a more matching energy level arrangement (Fig. 6h) and passivates the interface defects, thereby facilitating charge transfer. As mentioned above, the SnO2/perovskite buried interface, with more defects than the upper side, suffers from severer degradation under stronger light stress and threatens the stability of PSCs.97 As indicated in Fig. 6h, this strategy enables Cs+ to diffuse into the perovskite bottom, thereby playing a key role as a stabilizer to adjust the lattice strain in FAPbI3 and effectively mitigating ion migration and light-induced perovskite degradation. Accordingly, device stability against UV radiation is improved considerably, which preserves 88% of the initial PCE after 500 hours of UV irradiation. PSCs with an efficiency of 23.33% and negligible J–V hysteresis were finally achieved, and the unpackaged device retained 90% of the initial PCE after prolonged illumination at the MPP for more than 500 hours, as shown in Fig. 6i. This study provides a versatile and effective method for efficient and UV-resistant PSCs.
Xiong et al. fabricated an NdCl3 layer at the SnO2/perovskite interface by vacuum deposition,91 as depicted in Fig. 7a. Chloride ions interact strongly with perovskite and compensate for iodine vacancies, thereby passivating defects and suppressing non-radiative recombination. Moreover, NdCl3 can reinforce the ion migration activation energy in perovskite from 118.2 to 214.0 meV, as shown in Fig. 7b, thereby effectively suppressing iodine migration. In turn, both vacancy-related defects at the perovskite GBs and the interface trap between the CTL and perovskite can be effectively annihilated, as illustrated in Fig. 7c. NdCl3-treated perovskite film exhibits obviously annihilated PL and quick PL decay when excited from the ETL side, implying faster carrier collection and suppressed traps at the buried interface. Finally, a PSC with negligible J–V hysteresis, a VOC as high as 1.138 V and an efficiency of 22.13% was achieved. Moreover, it retained 83% of the initial value after 100 hours of MPP tracking, showing excellent stability.

Lithium salts with various anion configurations (CO32−, C2O42−, and HCOO−) were employed to modify the FAPbI3/SnO2 interface, as shown in Fig. 7d. Compared with C2O42− and HCOO−, CO32− has more negative adsorption energy with FA+, indicating that the hydrogen bond formed between the CO of this anion and the N–H of FA+ is stronger, thus resulting in a higher formation energy of the FA vacancy (Fig. 7e).95 Therefore, it passivates FA+ vacancies more efficiently. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results show only when CO and two C–O bonds are in a triangular configuration, just as in CO32−, the C–O interacts strongly with uncoordinated Sn4+ and binds more tightly with SnO2, thus effectively improving the SnO2 morphology. The (002) diffraction peak of perovskite film modified with Li2CO3 shows a larger shift to a small angle, and the slope of the 2θ–sin2Ψ curve is also smaller in the grazing incidence mode, implying that the internal strain in perovskite film is relieved, as illustrated in Fig. 7f. Therefore, Li2CO3 modification can efficiently release residual strain98 and promote the crystallization and stability of perovskite.61 Moreover, the PL intensity and carrier lifetime of Li2CO3-modified perovskite are obviously reduced, demonstrating that Li2CO3 modification leads to faster charge extraction and transport. In addition, Li+ diffused around the grain boundary attracts electrons but repulses holes, thereby inhibiting non-radiative recombination. The diffusion of Li+ to SnO2 is also beneficial for enhancing conductivity. Furthermore, Li2CO3 modification increases the contact potential difference at FAPbI3/SnO2 interface, yielding an enhanced built-in potential and depletion region and providing a stronger driving force for carrier separation and extraction. Devices with an efficiency of 23.5% were achieved, as shown in Fig. 7g, which maintained 90% of their initial efficiency under steady illumination for 1200 hours, demonstrating improved light stability.
Volatile ammonium formate (HCOONH4) pre-embedded in SnO2 ETL evaporates and percolates into perovskite from the bottom to the top during annealing, achieving the in situ integral modification of ETL, perovskite and the interface,93 as shown in Fig. 7h. HCOONH4 treatment reduces oxygen vacancies on SnO2 surface and suppresses carrier recombination through enhanced electron extraction and transport, which diffused to the SnO2/perovskite interface can enhance the interfacial contact and improve the lattice uniformity of perovskite by alleviating strain, as illustrated in Fig. 7i. Moreover, it can retard crystallization through the exchange of halogen anions with HCOO− percolated in perovskite, thereby reducing lattice defects, remarkably removing the surface wrinkles of perovskite grains, and improving film quality. The bottom-up modification significantly releases the residual strain and micro-strain in perovskite, passivates defects in perovskite, interface and GBs,99 and prolongs the device operation stability, as shown in Fig. 7j. Consequently, a flexible perovskite solar cell (F-PSC) with a laboratory PCE of 22.37% (a certified value of 21.9%) was achieved, which is the highest PCE reported to date. The resulting device retained more than 90% of the initial efficiency after 4000 cycles of bending without obvious changes in perovskite surface morphology (Fig. 7k), showing excellent mechanical durability. This study provides scientific guidance on residual strain mitigation at the buried interface.
Potassium sulphate (K2SO4) introduced at the SnO2/perovskite interface can passivate defects in perovskite and buried interface89 through the synergistic effect of anions and cations,100 as shown in Fig. 8a. K+ can diffuse into perovskite, as verified in Fig. 8b, thereby passivating defects in perovskite and prolonging the carrier lifetime. Moreover, it can inhibit ion migration by suppressing halide Frenkel defects, thereby minishing the device J–V hysteresis. Moreover, SO42− can form strong coordination with oxygen vacancies on the SnO2 surface and Pb2+ on the perovskite bottom interface (Fig. 8c and d), thereby passivating buried interface defects and inhibiting non-radiative recombination. In addition, K2SO4 facilitates electron transport by enhancing the SnO2 conductivity and promoting the growth of perovskite grains (increased from 259 to 279 nm). Moreover, K2SO4 treatment decreases the SnO2 conduction band from −3.90 to −3.95 eV, matching well with triple cation perovskite (CsFAMA) (−3.92 eV), which increases the device built-in potential from 0.94 to 0.99 V and facilitates carrier separation and transfer owing to the increased driving force and reduced potential barrier, as shown in Fig. 8e. Consequently, the VOC of the device was improved by limiting the voltage loss to 0.53 V, and the PCE was substantially elevated from 19.45% to 21.18%.101 The corresponding device depicts promoted stability, showing only a 15% PCE decline even after storage at 25% relative humidity for 1000 hours.

Wang et al. adopted ionic potassium L-aspartate (PL-A) and reconstructed the energy alignment at SnO2/perovskite interface through the self-diffusion interface doping,80 as exhibited in Fig. 8f. K+ can diffuse into and result in an n-type gradient doping in the vertical direction of perovskite, which induces additional built-in potential and promotes carrier separation and transfer, thereby significantly inhibiting carrier recombination in perovskite and the buried interface, as illustrated in Fig. 8g. The amino acid of PL-A can act as a Lewis base and coordinate with PbI2 to heal the defects of undercoordinated Pb2+ and Pb0. The –COO− of PL-A can increase the electron concentration on the SnO2 surface by bonding with the uncoordinated Sn, thereby reducing the SnO2 surface work function and inducing the surface dipole, as illustrated in Fig. 8h. The synergetic effects of n-type gradient doping and surface dipole optimize the energy level alignment at the buried interface, which, in turn, promotes carrier transport by suppressing recombination and improves the device stability by annihilating interfacial charge accumulation. Accordingly, PSCs with a VOC up to 1.19 V and a PCE of 23.74% were achieved.
Potassium hexafluorophosphate (KPF6) molecules containing both anions and cations can passivate both positive and negative defects, promote perovskite crystallization, and release the interface strain, as shown in Fig. 8i. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) results indicate that PF6− ions mainly accumulate at the SnO2/perovskite interface, and K+ forms a gradient distribution throughout the perovskite film, as shown in Fig. 8j. PF6− ions can fill the vacancies of iodide ions; the F atoms form hydrogen bonds with NH3+ of organic cations, thus inhibiting ion migration.90 In addition, the F atoms coordinate with Sn4+ in SnO2, thereby improving interfacial contact. As mentioned above, K+ diffused into the perovskite film can effectively passivate the defects and prolong the carrier lifetime. Surface scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that the KPF6 modification promotes crystallization and delivers more uniform and high-quality films with larger grains. Additionally, depth-dependent grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) reveals that the lattice spacing of perovskite after modification remains stable with the incident angle from 0.3° to 1.5°, demonstrating that KPF6 treatment releases residual strain in perovskite and suppresses interfacial defects and non-radiative recombination, as shown in Fig. 8k. PSCs with a PCE of 21.39% were finally achieved, and the unencapsulated device could maintain 80.1% of the initial PCE after storage at 60 °C for 960 hours.
The diffusible characteristics of ions make it possible to simultaneously optimize the perovskite, interface and buried CTL; hence, it is a very unique and convenient strategy to improve the device performance. However, it is also a double-edged sword, if not operated properly, which causes serious J–V hysteresis and deterioration of the device. Therefore, rationally developing more efficient and multifunctional materials is needed.
3.3 Passivation strategies at buried interfaces through the chemical bridge
Some molecules or organic salts with specific functional groups can simultaneously interact with CTL and perovskite. For example, carboxylate (–COO),102 amines (–NH2),29,103 sulfonic acid (–SO3),104 or hydroxyl (–OH)105 can coordinate with undercoordinated atoms, such as Sn on CTL surface and Pb as well as I on perovskite.106 Moreover, cations or anions can electrostatically couple with charged defects,107 which effectively passivate defects52 and optimize the energy level alignment of the device by establishing chemical bridges at the buried interface, as shown in Table 3. This opens up a new approach to further improve the device performance.

Carboxylic acid groups can interact with uncoordinated metal atoms.117 Therefore, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) (benzoic acid (BA), 4-pyridinecarboxylic acid (PA), 3-aminopropanoic acid (C3), 4-aminobenzoic acid (ABA), and 4-cyanobenzoic acid (CBA)) with carboxylic acid groups on one side and versatile functional groups on the other side are introduced at the buried interface,109 as illustrated in Fig. 9a. This enhances the electronic coupling between the perovskite and SnO2 layer. SnO2 surface work function can be tuned from ∼4.21 eV to 4.17, 4.16, 4.29, 4.05, and 4.07 eV through the modification of PA, BA, CBA, ABA, and C3, respectively. The trend of work function variation agrees with the surface dipole direction. Perovskite morphology hardly changed, but the device performance showed an obvious difference, as shown in Fig. 9b, mainly because the ionic-covalent nature of perovskite makes it easy to interact with different chemical groups, influencing the interface optoelectronic properties and device performance.118 Consequently, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) is remarkably improved by introducing pyridine carboxylic acid and PSCs with an efficiency of 18.8% were realized.

Novel sulfur salt (2-carboxyethyl)dimethyl sulfonium chloride (CDSC) and 3-dimethylamino propionic acid hydrochloride (DPAH) can form good connections between SnO2 and perovskite through chemical reactions,63 thereby improving interfacial contact, as shown in Fig. 9c. As illustrated in Fig. 9d, these two molecules can passivate oxygen vacancies on SnO2 surface through esterification or interaction with undercoordinated Sn4+, while cations and anions can interact with perovskite to suppress the charged defects around the bottom interface, which can improve the perovskite quality with improved morphology and grain size, thereby enhancing the carrier lifetime, as illustrated in Fig. 9e. Moreover, sulfonium salt can modulate the energy level alignment at the buried interface, as illustrated in Fig. 9f, improving electron extraction and suppressing interfacial recombination. Moreover, CDSC shows a better passivation effect than DPAH, as illustrated in Fig. 9g. The PCE of the DPAH-treated device is 21.44%, while it reaches 22.22% in the CDSC-modified device accompanied by a VOC of 1.163 V. Moreover, the unencapsulated device shows enhanced stability, which maintains 92.5% of the initial PCE after storage at 60 °C for 1272 hours, and remains 98.2% of the initial value after 1416 hours of storage in the dark with a relative humidity range of 10–20%. Therefore, it is demonstrated that sulfonium ions are more effective than widely used ammonium ions for buried interface passivation. For further applications, this guides exploring more effective molecules suitable for buried interface passivation.
3-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) self-assembled monolayer at the buried interface can bind tightly on the SnO2 surface through the interaction between hydrolyzed alkoxy and hydroxyl groups on the SnO2 surface.108 In addition, it connects perovskite through hydrogen bonds between amino groups and halide anions, as illustrated in Fig. 10a. Therefore, the chemical bridge achieved by APTES enhances interfacial contact and improves the perovskite film quality with promoted crystallinity. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 10b, APTES can induce a dipole and construct a more matched band alignment by decreasing the SnO2 surface work function, thereby enhancing the device built-in potential. This delivers an elevated VOC of the device stemming from the accelerated carrier separation and extraction. Moreover, the –NH2 terminal group of APTES can passivate traps on the perovskite bottom interface by forming hydrogen bonds (N–H⋯I), effectively suppressing charge accumulation and recombination. Moreover, the alkyl chain at the interface that acts as an insulating layer can block the reverse flow of electrons, thereby inhibiting carrier recombination. Consequently, PSCs with an efficiency of 17.03% succeeded, in which the VOC of 1.16 V was also the highest value of the MAPbI3 solar cell reported at that time.

Organic ammonium salts, such as PEAI, 1,4-butanediammonium iodide (BDAI), and guanidinium iodide (GAI), act as large alkylammonium interlayers (LAIs) between HTL and perovskite in inverted PSCs111 can suppress the non-radiative recombination both at the bottom and top interfaces of perovskite, as depicted in Fig. 10c. LAIs can significantly improve the PL intensity of perovskites, demonstrating that they can effectively reduce the interface traps and improve the charge selectivity at the buried interface. Moreover, the slightly reduced Urbach energy of perovskite implies a decreased band edge disorder owing to the improved crystallinity by regulating the film growth.119 LAIs can adequately suppress phase segregation, resulting in a more uniform top interface, as demonstrated in Fig. 10d. Consequently, BDAI modification significantly reduces energy loss and increases the VOC of PSCs with an optical bandgap of 1.59 eV ranging from 1.12 V to 1.21 V. Inverted PSCs with a champion efficiency of 22.31% and negligible J–V hysteresis were eventually achieved. The packaged device remains 87% of its initial efficiency after 850 hours of aging in the air with a relative humidity of 20% and a temperature of 25 °C.
Resistance to the polar solvents of P15 can be enhanced by covalently linking the hydroxyl group to a long alkyl chain-substituted conjugated polymer backbone, as shown in Fig. 10e. Through the self-assembly process, the –OH enriched surface improves wettability and benefits uniform perovskite film fabrication.110 Moreover, as shown in Fig. 10f, the O atom of –OH exposed on the surface can interact with the uncoordinated Pb2+, and the H atom can form a hydrogen bond with the adjacent I−, thus effectively passivating defects at the bottom surface of the perovskite, resulting in an efficient p–i–n device with a PCE of 20.12%.
Biguanide hydrochloride (BGCl) as a multifunctional modification material was introduced between SnO2 and perovskite,116 as shown in Fig. 11a. It is validated that BGCl chemically bonds with SnO2via the coordination between Sn4+ on SnO2 and the nitrogen of BGCl. Moreover, Cl− can electrostatically couple with SnO2 to reduce the oxygen vacancies, achieving the n-type doping of SnO2. In addition, –NH2/–NH3+ in BGCl can form hydrogen bonds with I/I− in PbI2, as the nucleation site of crystal growth, which contributes to the uniform distribution of PbI2 and promotes perovskite crystallization in the vertical direction, as shown in Fig. 11c. Additionally, BGCl tailors the band alignment around the buried interface (Fig. 11b). A higher matched energy level combined with lower interface defects obviously inhibits non-radiative recombination and promotes efficient carrier collection, yielding PSCs with an efficiency of 24.4%. The unpackaged device can maintain 95% of the initial efficiency after storage for 500 hours at 20 °C and 30% relative humidity, illustrating excellent environmental stability.

Asymmetric ammonium salt named N,N-dimethyl-1,3-propanediamine dihydroiodide (DMAPAI2) also can modify the buried interface,114 as illustrated in Fig. 11d. It can perturb the octahedral matrix of the perovskite, thereby improving the electronic properties of the perovskite surface. The halogen anion I− of DMAPAI2 can interact with Sn4+ on SnO2 through electrostatic coupling, thereby effectively filling the oxygen vacancies on the SnO2 surface and healing the defects, which improves the electron mobility of SnO2 and tunes the energy level alignment at the buried interface. DMAPA2+ reacts with iodine in perovskite through ionic or hydrogen bonds, which contributes to uniform nucleation and retards the growth of perovskite, thereby enhancing the crystallinity and substrate coverage of perovskite films. Consequently, high-quality perovskite films with fewer voids and grains as large as film thickness are obtained, substantially promoting charge transfer. Consequently, PSCs with a high PCE of 23.20% achieved excellent stability, which remained 85% of the initial efficiency after 1200 hours of continuous illumination.
Multifunctional chlorobenzenesulfonic potassium salts were also proposed to modify the buried interface,115 as depicted in Fig. 12a. Among them, 2,4,5-trichlorobenzenesulfonic acid potassium salt (3Cl-BSAK) contains more Cl, and the C–Cl bond possesses high electron density, which can act as the electron donor and form stronger interactions with uncoordinated Sn on SnO2 surface.120 It also provides additional negative charges to fill the oxygen vacancies, thus effectively suppressing carrier accumulation and improving carrier transport at the interface. In addition, 3Cl-BSAK modification can enhance the wettability of the SnO2 substrate and facilitate perovskite growth with large grain size and low defect density (Fig. 12b), which can optimize the energy level alignment around the buried interface and facilitate electron extraction (Fig. 12c). Moreover, the organic anion –SO3− containing SO can interact with uncoordinated Pb clusters or Pb2+,121 combine with the synergistic effects of K+, and heal the defects at the buried interface and perovskite GBs, thereby suppressing carrier recombination and ion migration, consequently minishing J–V hysteresis. Champion efficiency of 24.27% was finally achieved (Fig. 12d), and the unpackaged device maintained 95% of the initial efficiency after 100 days of aging at 15 ± 5% relative humidity and 20 ± 5 °C, showing good long-term stability.

Novel histamine diiodate (HADI) demonstrated excellent passivation effects,112 as shown in Fig. 12e. The –NH3 tail tends to interact strongly with SnO2, thereby passivating the defects and decreasing the roughness of the SnO2 surface, which shifts up the SnO2 conduction band, thereby reducing the electron transport barrier and inhibiting the interface recombination (Fig. 12f). The CN in the imidazole unit prefers to combine with the uncoordinated Pb2+ in perovskite via the Lewis acid–base interaction, which enhances the crystallinity, reduces the GBs and improves the wettability of perovskite. Hence, HADI can passivate both sides and facilitate charge extraction at the buried interface by forming a chemical bridge between SnO2 and perovskite. MA-free PSCs with a VOC up to 1.20 V and an efficiency of 24.79% were achieved. Moreover, a flexible device with an efficiency of 22.44% was also obtained, as shown in Fig. 12g, which is the highest PCE for flexible PSCs reported so far.
Adamantane derivatives with a CO functional group, such as 2-adamantanone (AD), 1-adamantane carboxylic acid (ADCA) and 1-adamantaneacetic acid (ADAA), can simultaneously passivate defects and release strain at the buried interface,113 as illustrated in Fig. 12h. The CO group, as a Lewis base,122 can interact with the undercoordinated Pb2+ of perovskite and Sn4+ on SnO2 surface, passivating defects related to undercoordinated Pb2+, iodine and oxygen vacancies. Interface modification also enhances the hydrophobicity of the substrate and inhibits the heterogeneous nucleation of the perovskite, thereby yielding a more uniform and dense perovskite film. Moreover, the steric hindrance between CO and perovskite (/SnO2) can be adjusted by changing the distance between CO and the adamantane ring. Steric hindrance reduces from AD and ADCA to ADAA, and the chemical interaction with perovskite and SnO2 increases. This leads to a more effective defect passivation and intensive chemical connection between perovskite and SnO2, thus obviously improving the interfacial contact and energy band alignment, substantially releasing the interface strain and facilitating the charge collection. The ADAA-based device achieved an efficiency of 23.18%, and the unpackaged device retained 81% of the initial efficiency after storage at 60 °C for 1000 hours.
The unique mixed ion-covalent properties of perovskite make it easy to interact with various functional groups. Hence, a chemical bridge between the perovskite layer and buried CTL can be easily established. However, it should be noted that only appropriate chemical interactions and heterojunction interfaces are required when selecting interfacial molecules.
3.4 Passivation strategies at buried interface through 2D perovskite
Except for the strong interactions with the CTL and perovskite, a 2D or heterogeneous intermediate layer can also be constructed by introducing modification molecules at the buried interface, as listed in Table 4. This induces highly crystallized perovskite and improves the interfacial contact, thereby significantly suppressing the recombination loss at the buried interface.

3D/2D mixed structure, which combines the high efficiency of 3D perovskite with the hydrophobicity of 2D perovskite, was established by introducing phenethylammonium bromide (PEABr) as the passivation layer at the buried interface in inverted PSCs,123 as shown in Fig. 13a. Owing to the high solubility of PEABr in the perovskite solvent, it can percolate into the perovskite and react with PbI2, resulting in a 2D structure at the bottom interface of the 3D perovskite after annealing, as illustrated in Fig. 13b. PEA+ cations can self-assemble at the GBs to enhance the perovskite quality with better crystallinity and morphology. Moreover, PEA+ and Br− significantly inhibited the non-radiative recombination by filling the MA+ and I− vacancies during the diffusion, as corroborated by the stronger PL intensity and longer carrier lifetime after PEABr treatment. In addition, this bottom-up passivation strategy prevents water and oxygen penetration. Accordingly, devices with an efficiency of 19.46% and improved long-term air stability were achieved.

The organic spacer cation of thiomorpholine 1,1-dioxide hydrochloride (TdCl) has a stronger interaction with PbI2 compared with FAI, thus making it easier to generate Td2PbI4 2D microcrystals when introduced into the perovskite precursor solution.125 This is verified by the additional diffraction peaks in XRD and the Stokes shift between film absorption and emission peaks. As depicted in Fig. 13c, the pre-nucleation of 2D Td2PbI4 decreases the supersaturation point of the perovskite precursor, modulates the 3D perovskite into heterogeneous nucleation mode, and promotes ordered perovskite crystallization. Plate-like 2D Td2PbI4 mainly gathered at the buried interface, acting as the bottom–top template to induce 3D perovskite growth. This delivers a high-quality film with orientated large crystals and reduced grain boundaries, significantly eliminating defects and inhibiting non-radiative recombination. Moreover, the appropriate concentration of Td+ makes the perovskite surface more n-type, which facilitates electron transport through a more matched energy level at the perovskite/ETL interface. In addition, 2D Td2PbI4 on the buried interface effectively blocks the interfacial redox reaction of Ni3+ with perovskite organic cations, thereby increasing the Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio at the interface, which reduces the VOC loss by decreasing the hole extraction barrier. Finally, the NiOx-based inverted PSCs with a champion efficiency of 22.09% and a VOC of 1.16 V were achieved, which also exhibited significantly improved long-term operation stability under humidity and thermal stress.
Considering that the hydrogen in the amine group prefers to bond with the uncoordinated oxygen on the metal oxide substrate, Chen et al. introduced guanidine molecules containing three –NH2 groups at the buried interface.124 Hydrogen in guanidine shows the largest average binding energy with the undercoordinated oxygen in NiOx by introducing n-butylammonium (BA), ethylammonium (EA), dimethylammonium (DMA), and guanidinium (GUA) into the perovskite precursor solution, providing effective passivation of dangling bonds on NiOx surface. Moreover, its highly symmetrical structure guarantees the uniform formation of perovskite films. It can induce the prior crystallization of 2D GUA2PbI4 perovskite on the buried interface, as shown in Fig. 13d, which suppresses the non-radiative recombination considerably, resulting in a 72% decrease in the surface recombination velocity (SRV). Accordingly, the VOC of NiOx-based inverted devices achieved a 65 mV enhancement, yielding an efficiency of 20.1%.
By coupling the Cl-bonded SnO2 with a Cl-containing perovskite precursor, ∼2 nm-thick FASnClx interlayer can be formed at the buried interface,6 as illustrated in Fig. 13e. The interlayer with atomic coherence can reduce the non-radiative recombination loss and contact resistance at the interface by defect healing. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the FASnClx layer leads to negligible perovskite lattice distortion, as shown in Fig. 13f, which remarkably quenches the perovskite photoluminescence. Hence, with good contact with both sides, the FASnClx interlayer can significantly promote carrier extraction and transportation. High-performance PSCs with a laboratory PCE of 25.8% and a certified PCE of 25.5% were achieved. Moreover, compared with the mesoporous TiO2-based device with good stability, the corresponding device exhibited better stability under MPP tracking; the unencapsulated device retained 90% of the initial PCE after 500 hours of continuous illumination under an inert atmosphere.
Hence, 2D perovskite acting as an effective modification strategy has potential application in efficient and stable PSCs. However, its poor conductivity, the difficulty of controlled fabrication, and the function mechanism still need further exploration.
3.5 Passivation strategies at the buried interface through dipole
Certain molecules can form dipoles at the CTL/perovskite interface, which causes band bending and provides a more matched energy level alignment, thereby facilitating carrier transportation and collection.126 The photovoltaic parameters of PSCs passivated through the dipole are listed in Table 5.

4-Imidazoleacetic acid hydrochloride (ImAcHCl) introduced at the buried interface,127 as shown in Fig. 14a, exhibits a strong dipole moment stemming from the electron density changing from 127.378 kJ mol−1 of –COOH to 659.322 kJ mol−1 of imidazole ring, as illustrated in Fig. 14b. As a multifunctional chemical linker, the carboxylic acid group links with the hydroxyl group on SnO2 surface through esterification; imidazolium cation electrostatically interacts with iodine ions in perovskite, resulting in an interfacial chemical bridge, as shown in Fig. 14c. SnO2 conductivity can be enhanced with this ionic liquid treatment, thereby facilitating electron transport. Improved surface wettability of SnO2 and the introduction of Cl promote perovskite crystallinity. Moreover, the interface dipole modulates the bond alignment, as shown in Fig. 14d, assisted with the passivation effects of imidazolium cations and chloride ions,130 suppresses the charge recombination and facilitates the carrier collection. PSCs with an efficiency of 20.96% and suppressed J–V hysteresis were achieved. Unencapsulated devices also show excellent long-term stability, remaining 94% of the initial PCE after 35 days of storage under room temperature and dark conditions.

Thiophene-based molecules exhibit a polarized charge distribution (Fig. 14g), which can improve the perovskite crystallinity and tune the device band alignment through a simple solution process,30 thus reducing the energy loss, as illustrated in Fig. 14e. The –COOH group can passivate the –OH dangling bonds on SnO2 surface. The thiophene ring donates electrons to the carboxylic acid side, improving the electrical conductivity of SnO2 and inhibiting non-radiative recombination by tuning the electronic state of the SnO2 surface, as illustrated in Fig. 14f. In particular, the thiophene-3-acetic acid molecule (TA 2) with a larger dipole moment (4.03) can reduce the SnO2 work function from 4.65 to 4.36 eV, tuning the Fermi level (EF) closer to the perovskite conduction band, thus enhancing charge collection. The perovskite band bends upward without treatment, as shown in Fig. 14h, which results in electron accumulation. In contrast, it bends downward because of the interfacial dipole with the TA 2 treatment, as illustrated in Fig. 14i. The energy gap between the EF of SnO2 and the conduction band of perovskite decreases, while the gap between SnO2EF and the valence band of perovskite increases, thereby suppressing interfacial carrier recombination and enhancing device VOC by promoting electron extraction and impeding hole reverse transfer. Moreover, TA 2 treatment reduces nucleation density by improving the SnO2 surface morphology. In addition, S atoms on the thiophene ring with an electron lone pair can interact with uncoordinated Pb2+ in perovskite, thus delivering polycrystalline perovskite film with greater grain size and lower defect density. MAPbI3-based PSCs with promoted VOC from 1.072 V to 1.117 V and PCE of 20.61% were achieved eventually, which also exhibits good thermal and humidity stability.
Both the top and bottom interfaces of Sn–Pb hybrid perovskite are modified by introducing glycine hydrochloride (GlyHCl) into the perovskite precursor, and post-treatment on perovskite with ethylenediammonium diiodide (EDAI2),128 which considerably improves device performance, as illustrated in Fig. 15a–c. The EDA2+ cations introduced by post-treatment are mostly accumulated on the perovskite surface. One of its methylamine groups connects to perovskite grains and greatly inhibits surface defects; the other one points away from perovskite and induces the surface dipole. The potential difference generated by the dipole promotes the extraction and collection of electrons from the perovskite to the ETL. The methylamine groups of GlyH+ cations aggregated at the buried interface can act as nucleation centers during perovskite growth, consequently enhancing the film crystallinity and passivating the recombination centers simultaneously. The electronegative –COOH groups point to the HTL; accordingly, an electric field directed to the HTL is introduced by the dipole, promoting hole extraction. Consequently, Sn–Pb hybrid PSCs with a PCE as high as 23.6% were achieved. The unencapsulated device also maintained over 80% of the initial PCE after 200 hours of illumination in an inert environment.

Electron density gradually decreases from the negative charge center (–SO2−) to the positive charge center (–C(NH2)2+) in the zwitterion of formamidine sulfinic acid (FSA), thereby introducing a strong dipole moment at the buried interface,129 as demonstrated in Fig. 15d and e. This optimizes the energy level alignment between SnO2 and perovskite, facilitates electron extraction and blocks hole transport (Fig. 15f). In addition, Sn atoms on SnO2 accept electrons from FSA molecules through Sn–O bonds, resulting in a remarkable increase in delocalized electrons on Sn atoms and the charge redistribution on the ETL surface, thus enhancing ETL conductivity. FSA treatment can improve interfacial contact by flattening the SnO2 surface and hence promoting the vertical growth of high-quality perovskite grains. Moreover, the stacking direction of residual PbI2 in film can be modulated in the vertical direction, which regularly distributes at the perovskite GBs after FSA treatment, adequately inhibiting the side effects on the perovskite structure (Fig. 15g). Furthermore, the strong interaction between C(NH2)2+ groups in the FSA and [PbI6]4− structures of perovskite can effectively suppress the Pb–I antisites in perovskite (Fig. 15h). Consequently, this obviously reduces carrier recombination and promotes interfacial charge extraction and transport, delivering FAPbI3 PSCs with efficiency as high as 24.1%, which is one of the highest value for FAPbI3-based PSCs fabricated using the two-step method. The unpackaged device remained at 85% of the initial PCE after 1000 hours of continuous illumination in a nitrogen atmosphere, showing excellent long-term operating stability.
Therefore, dipoles induced through directional aggregation at the interface demonstrated an excellent ability to improve the device performance. Comprehensive characterization and systematic study of the formation and function mechanisms further promote their vast applications in solar cells.
4. Conclusions and outlook
In this review, we systematically inspect the morphology, composition and microstructure of buried interface, and we then summarize the effective passivation strategies and corresponding mechanisms from the perspectives of buried carrier transporting layer optimization, ion diffusion, chemical bridge, 2D perovskite, and electrical dipole effect.
It is recognized that, as the PCE of PSCs approaches the theoretical limit, buried interface engineering is becoming critical for improving device performance. Although great progress has been made, there are still some challenges that need to be addressed. For example, a comprehensive study through systematic in situ characterization of buried interfaces is relatively difficult and needs further exploration. In addition, novel materials with lower cost, multiple functions and excellent environmental stability should be proposed. However, it is believed that as an effective strategy, buried interface passivation further promotes PSC performance.
