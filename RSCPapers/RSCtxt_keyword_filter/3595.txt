The structure of P3HT nanofibres can affect the charge-transfer interaction of the P3HT/GO composites. In this work, the amount and molecular order of P3HT nanofibres in P3HT/GO composites (P3HT–GO-BCs) were modulated by the combination of the nucleation effect and the adsorption effect of GO on P3HT in solution after ultrasonication. UV-visible (UV-vis) spectra and Raman spectra verify that variation in the amount and the molecular order of P3HT nanofibres on the GO surface can effectively control the interfacial charge-transfer interaction between GO and P3HT. The properties of P3HT–GO-BCs were compared with the P3HT/GO composites prepared in our previous work (P3HT–GO-ACs). The results indicate that choosing the appropriate time to mix GO with a conjugated polymer is an easy way to modulate the aggregate structure and charge-transfer interaction of P3HT/GO composites.
Introduction
Semicrystalline conjugated polymers (CPs) exhibit outstanding and tunable optoelectronic properties while offering low-cost solution processability. An increasing number of CPs have been used in the fields of electronics, optoelectronics, batteries and supercapacitors.1–3 One of the key research topics about CPs is obtaining efficient charge transport/charge separation characteristics and high carrier mobility. Understanding the relationships among structure, morphology, interface interactions and optoelectronic properties is important for the application of CPs. Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is a typical benchmark semicrystalline CP that can be used to investigate the relationship between the polymer structure and optoelectronic performance. P3HT nanostructures with high crystallinity and high molecular order have excellent carrier transport properties.4–6 Modulating the crystallization kinetics of P3HT is a useful method to form well-defined aggregate structures in films.7–10
Graphene oxide (GO) contains sp2 conjugated domains interspersed with polar oxygenated domains, which endow GO with the ability to mediate a multiple range of energy and charge exchange interactions with polymers.11 CP/GO hybrid nanocomposite materials have gained substantial attention due to their applications in the fields of electronics and optoelectronics.12–14 Wang et al. fabricated P3HT/GO hybrid sheets via π–π interactions and demonstrated that the hybrid sheets had broad-band absorption and excellent photocatalytic properties.15 Chunder et al. found that P3HT could form nanowires on reduced GO (RGO) surfaces through an RGO-induced crystallization process, and the conductivity of P3HT/RGO composites increased to 6.0 × 10−3 S m−1.16 Zheng et al. prepared P3HT-coated GO composites (P-GO) and found that the addition of P-GO to P3HT:[6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) bulk heterojunction solar cells improved the power conversion efficiency by ∼18%.17 Pandey et al. prepared poly[2,5-bis(3-tetradecylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene] (PBTTT)/GO nanocomposites by the floating-film transfer method and fabricated organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) by adding nanocomposites.18 They found that the OTFTs showed better device performance featuring ∼0.112 cm2 V−1 s−1 field effect mobility and a 103 on/off ratio under ambient conditions. These studies emphasized that the interactions between GO and conjugated polymers endowed the composite with excellent properties, which neither of them possessed individually.
Although most of these studies demonstrated that the strong interactions between GO and CPs are critical factors for improving the performance of devices, studies related to controlling these interactions are rare. Istif et al. prepared P3HT nanoparticle (P3HTNP)–GO hybrid nanoassemblies by an in situ reprecipitation process involving rapid injections of P3HT in tetrahydrofuran into an excess volume of water dispersions of GO.19 They varied the ratio of P3HTNP:GO to control the interaction between P3HTNP and GO and found that the change in the interaction could vary the photoinduced charge transfer properties of the P3HTNP–GO complex. Liu et al. prepared P3HT nanofibres with different molecular orders and found that the interactions between different P3HT nanofibres and GO varied.20 They also found that stronger interfacial interactions between P3HT and GO occurred after thermal annealing due to the changes in the P3HT chain conformations and packing order.21 In our previous work, we modulated the molecular order of the P3HT nanofibres by ultrasonication and found that GO prefers to adsorb P3HT nanofibres with low molecular order.22 Moreover, the above studies reported a common phenomenon: the molecular order of P3HT nanostructures varied before and after interacting with GO, hinting that GO affects the aggregate structure of P3HT in P3HT/GO composites. The aggregate structure of P3HT can dramatically affect device performance.23–25 Variation in the aggregate structure of P3HT can also affect the charge-transfer interaction between P3HT and GO.20–22 Controlling the aggregate structure of P3HT in P3HT/GO composites is an issue that warrants further study, but few investigations have addressed it.
In this work, we dipped GO into P3HT solution, ultrasonicated the solution and aged the solution for 24 h. With the assistance of ultrasonication to disentangle the P3HT chains and cause the P3HT concentration to fluctuate in the solution, the combination of the nucleation effect and adsorption effect of GO on P3HT can greatly modulate the amount and molecular order of the P3HT nanofibres in P3HT/GO composites. UV-vis spectra and Raman spectra verify that the charge-transfer interaction between GO and P3HT nanofibres with different structures varied more. We also compared the structures and charge transport properties of P3HT/GO composites with the properties of composites prepared in our previous work,22 verifying that choosing the appropriate time to mix GO with a conjugated polymer may offer new pathways for the fabrication of improved optoelectronic thin film devices.
Experimental section
Sample preparation
Commercial high-Mw P3HT (Mw = 7.9 × 104 g mol−1, polydispersity index (PDI) = 1.24, H–T regioregularity ≥90%) and low-Mw P3HT (Mw = 3.5 × 104 g mol−1, PDI = 1.83, H–T regioregularity ≥96%) were purchased from Rieke Metals, Inc. GO was purchased from Nanjing XFNANO Materials Tech Co. Toluene was purchased from Beijing Chemical Reagents Company. Anisole was purchased from Acros Organics. All materials were used as received.
A GO/water suspension with a concentration of 0.1 mg mL−1 was ultrasonicated for 10 min, and then the supernatant liquid was diluted five times. Thirty microlitres of diluted supernatant liquid was dropped onto the clean silicon (Si) wafer and dried in a fume hood at room temperature. It has been demonstrated in our previous work that a GO monolayer film forms on a Si substrate.22 P3HT was dissolved in a 3:1 volume ratio of anisole:toluene at a concentration of 0.1 mg mL−1, then stirred at 85 °C for 1 h and quenched to 20 °C. After the P3HT solution was quenched at 20 °C, the Si wafer coated with the GO monolayer film (GO–Si wafer) was dipped into the solution and ultrasonicated with a frequency of 40 kHz and a power of 100 W (KQ-100E ultrasonic cleaner) for 1 min, 5 min and 10 min, respectively. Then, the P3HT solution/dipped GO–Si wafer was isothermally crystallized at 20 °C after ultrasonication, and the GO–Si wafer was removed from the P3HT solution after 1 h (for atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements) or 24 h (for UV-vis and Raman measurements), followed by immersion in anisole:toluene mixed solvent for 1 min to remove the unadsorbed P3HT nanofibres.
Characterization
AFM (Nanoscope VIII MultiMode, Bruker) measurements were taken in tapping mode. Triangular silicon tips (TESP) with a resonance frequency of ∼300 kHz and a spring constant of approximately 40 N m−1 were used. The UV-vis absorption spectra at wavelengths ranging from 350–750 nm were collected on an Agilent Cary 60 UV-vis spectrophotometer at room temperature. Raman spectra with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm were recorded using a LabRAM Aramis (Horiba Jobin Yvon Company). Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements were performed at 1W1A (λ = 0.1549 nm), Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF), using a 9910 detector, Si (220) single-crystal monochromator and a photon energy of 8.0049 keV. An incident angle of 0.1° was chosen to ensure that the samples were probed. The sample thickness was normalized for treating the GIXRD data.
Results and discussion
In our previous work, we first prepared P3HT nanofibres with different molecular orders induced by ultrasonication. Then, the GO–Si wafer was dipped into completely crystallized P3HT nanofibre solutions and incubated for 24 h to investigate the interactions between GO and P3HT nanofibres.22 The preparation process is shown in Fig. 1A. In this work, we dipped the GO–Si wafer into a P3HT solution, which was quenched at 20 °C, ultrasonicated the P3HT solution/GO–Si wafer for different lengths of time, and placed the GO–Si wafer in the solution at 20 °C for 24 h to investigate the crystallization and adsorption of P3HT on GO. The experimental process is shown in Fig. 1B. The P3HT nanofibre/GO composites prepared by the A and B processes are named P3HT–GO-ACs and P3HT–GO-BCs, respectively. To better understand the interfacial interaction between P3HT and GO, we compared the properties of P3HT–GO-ACs and P3HT–GO-BCs. The experimental data of pristine P3HT nanofibres (spin-coated from the completely crystallized P3HT solutions without GO) and of P3HT–GO-ACs shown below were obtained from previous work.22 In order to ensure that P3HT only interacted with GO on the GO–Si wafer surface, we investigated the effects of the Si wafer on the nucleation and crystallization of P3HT. The naked Si wafer was dipped into P3HT solutions, ultrasonicated for 10 min and incubated at 20 °C for 24 h. Then the Si wafer was removed from the P3HT solution and immersed in anisole:toluene mixed solvent for 1 min. The AFM images of the Si wafer are shown in Fig. S1.† No P3HT nanofibres were formed on the Si wafer, indicating that the Si wafer has no nucleation and adsorption effects on P3HT. The small points on the Si wafer may be the impurities in the solution.

Fig. 2 shows the GIXRD curves of the GO–Si wafer before and after ultrasonication. The GO–Si wafer was prepared following a previously described process and was demonstrated as a GO monolayer film on the Si substrate.22 The peak at ∼10.8° is the characteristic diffraction peak of GO. The peak intensity is relatively low because the GO content is scarce in the GO–Si wafer. The peak position and intensity did not change before and after ultrasonication for 10 min, indicating that nearly no GO was shed from the Si wafer after ultrasonication with such power and frequency in the anisole:toluene mixed solvent. That is, the difference in P3HT–GO-BCs prepared by different ultrasonication times was not attributed to the destruction of the GO monolayer by ultrasonication.

Fig. 3 shows the AFM images of high-Mw P3HT–GO-BCs prepared for different ultrasonication times. The GO–Si wafer was obtained from P3HT solution after isothermal crystallization at 20 °C for 1 h. Some P3HT nanofibres formed on the GO–Si wafer, and the amount of nanofibres increased with increasing ultrasonication time. This result is in contrast to that of the initial stage of the preparation of high-Mw P3HT–GO-ACs, in which the amount of adsorbed P3HT nanofibres decreased with prolonged ultrasonication time.22 The results are discussed below.

To obtain enough P3HT nanofibres on the GO surface to perform UV-vis and Raman measurements, the GO–Si wafer was placed in P3HT solutions at 20 °C for 24 h. In Fig. 4a, all the UV-vis absorption spectra of high-Mw P3HT–GO-BCs exhibit peaks at ∼514 nm, corresponding to the π–π absorption, and at ∼550 nm and ∼600 nm, which are the shoulders for two vibronic absorption bands of P3HT in the solid-state.26–28 The UV-vis spectra demonstrate that solid P3HT nanostructures formed on the GO surface. The peak position and peak shapes of each P3HT–GO-BC are similar, but the peak intensity changes widely. In this work, we did not use the peak fitting method to quantitatively calculate the aggregation degree, and we used the peak intensity to compare the amount of P3HT nanofibres in P3HT–GO-BCs, the same as that used in our previous work.22 The light-absorption intensity of high-Mw P3HT–GO-BCs decreases with the prolongation of ultrasonication time, indicating that the amount of P3HT nanofibres on the GO surface is the lowest when the P3HT solution/GO–Si wafer was ultrasonicated for 10 min. The absorbance ratio of A0–0/A0–1 relates to the conjugation length and molecular order of P3HT nanofibres.20 Trznadel et al. and Boucher et al. reported that the redshift of the 0–1 and 0–2 vibronic bands of the UV-vis spectra reflects the decreased optical gap that results from greater delocalization of the exciton wave function. The redshift reveals an increase in the average conjugation length of P3HT aggregates, and the blueshift signifies a lower effective conjugation length in the aggregates.29,30 In Fig. 4a, there are no obvious redshifts or blueshifts in the UV-vis spectra of high-Mw P3HT–GO-BCs, so we hypothesize that the variation in the absorbance ratio of A0–0/A0–1 mainly originated from the change in the molecular order of P3HT nanofibres. For P3HT–GO-BCs, the A0–0/A0–1 ratio of P3HT nanofibres formed under quiescent conditions is the lowest, as shown in Fig. 4b. After ultrasonication, the A0–0/A0–1 ratio was enhanced dramatically, and the P3HT nanofibres formed after ultrasonication for 10 min had the highest A0–0/A0–1 ratio of 0.706, indicating that ultrasonication increases more ordered P3HT nanofibres formed on the GO surface in P3HT–GO-BCs. The combined AFM and UV-vis data show that at the initial stage of preparing P3HT–GO-BCs, the amount of P3HT nanofibres on the GO surface increases with ultrasonication time; at the end of preparing P3HT–GO-BCs, the amount decreases, but the molecular order of P3HT nanofibres increases with prolonged ultrasonication time. The amount and molecular order of P3HT nanofibres are critical factors in determining the carrier transport performance of P3HT. Moreover, the variation of the amount and molecular order may effectively modulate the charge-transfer interaction between P3HT nanofibres and GO.

Apparently, the effects of GO on the formation of P3HT nanofibres are the critical factors to determine the amount and molecular order of P3HT nanofibres in P3HT/GO composites. Yang et al. found that poly(3-alkylthiophene)s (P3ATs) could crystallize on the GO surface to increase the dispersibility of GO in o-dichlorobenzene.31,32 Nikhil et al. reported that PBTTT could rapidly grow high-quality nanocomposite thin films on a GO surface by the floating film transfer method.18 Our group found that the residual P3HT chains could nucleate and crystallize on the GO surface when the GO–Si wafer was dipped into the completely crystallized P3HT solution.22 These studies suggest that P3HT molecule chains prefer to nucleate on the GO surface in solution. In addition to the nucleation effect, GO has been reported to strongly adsorb P3HT nanofibres in solution.20,22 That is, when the P3HT solution/GO–Si wafer was incubated at 20 °C, some P3HT molecule chains near the GO–Si wafer may nucleate on the GO surface to form nanofibres, and other P3HT molecule chains in the solution may self-assemble to form nanofibres. As time passes, an increasing number of self-assembled nanofibres form. These nanofibres can be adsorbed on the GO surface. Finally, the overall P3HT nanofibres on the GO surface are the combination of the nucleated nanofibres and the adsorbed nanofibres. The amount and molecular order of P3HT–GO-BCs are a combination of these two parts: GO-nucleated nanofibres and GO-adsorbed nanofibres.
The structures of P3HT nanofibres depend on the aggregation kinetics in the solution. The interactions and entanglements among the polymer chains are strong for high-Mw P3HT in the anisole:toluene mixed solvent at 20 °C.22 For GO-nucleated P3HT, crystallization accelerates due to the nucleation effect of GO. Under quiescent conditions, the accelerated crystallization causes more defects and disorder in the P3HT nanofibres, resulting in the A0–0/A0–1 ratio of P3HT nanofibres nucleated by GO being lower than those self-assembled in the solution. Ultrasonication could promote the disentanglement of P3HT chains and cause the concentration of the P3HT solution to fluctuate.7,33 When P3HT in marginal solvent was ultrasonicated at 20 °C, the disentanglement of the P3HT chains in solution via ultrasonication facilitates the movement of polymer chains by alleviating the suppression and hindrance from surrounding polymer molecules, resulting in increased freedom for the polymer chains. Furthermore, the concentration fluctuation improves P3HT crystallization in the high-concentration region. The nucleation effect makes the disentangled P3HT chains nucleate and crystallize on GO quickly, which prevents the disentangled P3HT chains from relaxing back to entangle again before crystallization. These kinetic factors in the solution are shown to promote the formation of high-Mw P3HT nanofibres nucleated on the GO surface with local and long-range order, namely, the A0–0/A0–1 peak ratio increases. The higher the degree of disentanglement of P3HT molecule chains, the higher the molecular order of GO-nucleated P3HT nanofibres, namely, the molecular order of GO-nucleated P3HT nanofibres increases with prolonged ultrasonication time. Moreover, due to the fast crystallization induced by GO, the molecular order of GO-nucleated P3HT nanofibres is higher than that of nanofibres self-assembled in the ultrasonicated solution. In this work, only one Si wafer with a GO monolayer was dipped into P3HT solution, and the GO content was low. Relative to the GO nucleated P3HT chains, most P3HT molecule chains may self-assemble to form nanofibres in the solution, and the molecular order of the self-assembled P3HT nanofibres may be the same in the solutions under the same ultrasonication conditions with or without the GO–Si wafer. Namely, the molecular order of self-assembled P3HT nanofibres (prepared by the process shown in Fig. 1B) is nearly the same as that of P3HT nanofibres spin-coated from the completely crystallized P3HT solution (such as that shown in Fig. 1A), which increases with prolonged ultrasonication time.22 The self-assembled nanofibres were generally adsorbed on the GO surface in the solution. In high-Mw P3HT–GO-BCs, the molecular order of both the nucleated nanofibres and the adsorbed nanofibres increased with prolonged ultrasonication time, so the overall molecular order of P3HT–GO-BCs ultrasonicated for 10 min was the highest.
The overall amount of P3HT nanofibres on the GO surface is the combination of the nucleated nanofibres and the adsorbed nanofibres. At the initial stage of crystallization, under quiescent conditions, the crystallization rate is slow, and the amounts of the self-assembled nanofibers and the nucleated nanofibers are low. Ultrasonication promotes P3HT nucleation and crystallization on the GO surface and self-assembly in the solution. The crystallization of P3HT accelerates with the ultrasonication time, increasing the amount of nucleated nanofibers and self-assembled nanofibers with the prolongation of ultrasonication time. Therefore, at the initial crystallization, the amount of P3HT nanofibres in the P3HT–GO-BCs increases with prolonged ultrasonication time, as shown in the AFM images. At the end of the P3HT–GO-BC preparation (24 h), the UV-vis data show that the amount of P3HT nanofibres on the GO surface decreases with prolonged ultrasonication time. In our previous work, it can be seen that the self-assembled P3HT nanofibers tend to aggregate or form networks in the solution.22 Once one of the P3HT nanofibers among the aggregate or network was adsorbed on GO, it may lead to the nanofiber aggregate or network being indirectly grafted on GO. But for nucleated P3HT, a nucleation site can only grow one P3HT nanofiber. So the adsorption effects of GO tend to increase the amount of P3HT nanofibers, such as shown in Fig. S2.† Our previous work verifies that P3HT nanofibres with low molecular order prefer to be adsorbed on the GO surface.22 The molecular order of P3HT nanofibres self-assembled in solution increases with increasing ultrasonication time, so the amount of nanofibres adsorbed on the GO surface may be much greater in quiescent solution than in ultrasonicated solution. The decrease in the P3HT nanofibre amount on the GO surface corresponding to changes in ultrasonication time indicates that the adsorption effect of GO is important during the crystallization progress, although some nucleated P3HT nanofibres are present on the GO surface.
For comparison, the A0–0/A0–1 ratios of high-Mw P3HT nanofibres spin-coated from completely crystallized P3HT solutions without GO and high-Mw P3HT–GO-ACs are also presented in Fig. 4b. The A0–0/A0–1 ratio of P3HT–GO-BCs is the lowest under quiescent conditions. When the P3HT solution was ultrasonicated, the A0–0/A0–1 ratio of P3HT–GO-BCs increased dramatically to values even higher than that of P3HT–GO-ACs, which had the same ultrasonication time. Similarly, the overall A0–0/A0–1 ratios of P3HT–GO-ACs were also influenced by two components: the GO nucleated nanofibres and the GO adsorbed nanofibres. The A0–0/A0–1 ratios of the adsorbed nanofibres (namely, the assembled nanofibres) of P3HT–GO-ACs and P3HT–GO-BCs under the same ultrasonication conditions are the same. The higher A0–0/A0–1 ratio of P3HT–GO-BCs compared to that of P3HT–GO-ACs indicates that the contribution of the nucleated nanofibres in P3HT–GO-BCs is higher than that in P3HT–GO-ACs.

Fig. 5a shows that the absorption intensity of the peak at ∼514 nm of P3HT–GO-BCs is lower than that of P3HT–GO-ACs. This outcome means that the amount of P3HT nanofibres on the GO surface prepared by nucleation and adsorption in the P3HT solution is lower than those prepared in a completely crystallized P3HT solution. This result verifies that in comparison with P3HT–GO-ACs under the same ultrasonication conditions, the nucleation effect is more dominant in P3HT–GO-BCs; namely, the amount of the adsorbed nanofibres is relatively low, so the molecular order is high and the nanofibre content is low. Fig. 5b shows the normalized absorption spectra of the P3HT nanofibres, P3HT–GO-ACs and P3HT–GO-BCs ultrasonicated for 10 min. The broadening of the spectra of the P3HT–GO composites compared to that of the P3HT nanofibres without GO demonstrates the charge-transfer interactions between P3HT and GO.15,18 The absorption spectrum of the P3HT–GO-BCs is slightly broader than that of the P3HT–GO-ACs, indicating that the charge-transfer interactions between P3HT and GO were different due to the different nanofibre amounts and molecular orders. This study suggests that the charge-transfer interaction of P3HT/GO composites can be easily modulated by adding GO into P3HT solution at different times (before crystallization or after crystallization).

The charge-transfer interactions between the P3HT nanofibres and GO of high-Mw P3HT–GO-BCs were also investigated by Raman spectroscopy, and the data are shown in Fig. 6a. In the Raman modes of P3HT, the main in-plane ring skeleton mode at ∼1450 cm−1 corresponds to the symmetric CC stretch mode, and that at ∼ 1381 cm−1 corresponds to the C–C intraring stretch mode. With the prolongation of the ultrasonication time, the position of the CC stretch transitions from 1454 cm−1 to 1445 cm−1, and the full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) of the CC mode decreases from 33.9 cm−1 to 26.6 cm−1, as summarized in Fig. 6b and c. The shift in the CC mode peak position to a lower wavenumber and a narrower FWHM of the CC mode verify that the molecular order of high-Mw P3HT–GO-BCs increases with the prolongation of the ultrasonication time.20,22,34 In comparison with the Raman spectra of P3HT–GO-ACs, the CC mode peak position is higher and the FWHM of the CC mode is broader for P3HT–GO-BCs prepared in quiescent crystallization, indicating that the molecular order of P3HT–GO-BCs is lower than that of P3HT–GO-ACs for static crystallization. When the P3HT solution was ultrasonicated, the CC mode peak position is lower and the FWHM of the CC mode is narrower for P3HT–GO-BCs than that for P3HT–GO-ACs, demonstrating that the molecular order of P3HT–GO-BCs is higher than that of P3HT–GO-ACs. The molecular order results obtained from the Raman spectra are in accordance with those obtained from the UV-vis spectra. The peak at ∼1600 cm−1 is the G band of GO. It is significant that the position of the G band of P3HT–GO-BCs decreases with prolonged ultrasonication time. The variation of the G band position supports the concept that charge transfer occurs at the interface between P3HT and GO.19,20 For the same ultrasonication time of 10 min, the G band of P3HT–GO-ACs is at 1592 cm−1, and the G band of P3HT–GO-BCs is at 1598 cm−1. The variation in the G band positions indicates that the charge-transfer interaction between P3HT and GO could be tuned by different P3HT nanostructures.

Low-Mw P3HT–GO-BCs were prepared, investigated and compared to P3HT–GO-ACs. Fig. 7 shows the AFM images of low-Mw P3HT–GO-BCs ultrasonicated for different times. The GO–Si wafer was obtained from P3HT solution after isothermal crystallization at 20 °C for 1 h. Some P3HT nanofibres form on the GO–Si wafer, and the amount of nanofibres increases with increasing ultrasonication time. The result is similar to that of low Mw P3HT–GO-ACs.22

Fig. 8 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of low-Mw P3HT–GO-BCs prepared in solutions ultrasonicated for different times. All the UV-vis absorption spectra of low-Mw P3HT–GO-BCs exhibit peaks at ∼508 nm, ∼550 nm and ∼600 nm, verifying that solid P3HT nanofibres were nucleated and adsorbed onto the GO surface. The absorption intensity of P3HT–GO-BCs increases with prolonged ultrasonication time, indicating that ultrasonication improves the amount of P3HT nanofibres on the GO surface. Fig. 8b shows that the A0–0/A0–1 ratio of low-Mw P3HT–GO-BCs obtained from the UV-vis spectra decreases with prolonged ultrasonication time, indicating that ultrasonication improves low-Mw P3HT nanofibres with lower molecular order on the GO surface. Similarly, the P3HT nanofibres in low-Mw P3HT–GO-BCs are composed of two parts: GO-nucleated nanofibres and GO-adsorbed nanofibres. The entanglement is low for the low-Mw P3HT in the mixed solvent.22,35 GO accelerates the crystallization of low-Mw P3HT, resulting in more defects and greater disorder in the P3HT nanofibres, so the molecular order of P3HT nanofibres nucleated on the GO surface is lower than that of those self-assembled in the solution. After ultrasonication, the concentration fluctuation improves the nucleation of the molecular chains on the GO surface in the high-concentration region, and the nucleation and crystallization of P3HT on the GO surface accelerate with prolonged ultrasonication time. The accelerated crystallization leads to a decrease in the molecular order of GO-nucleated P3HT nanofibres with prolonged ultrasonication time. Relative to the GO nucleated P3HT chains, most P3HT molecule chains in the solution may self-assemble to form nanofibres, and the molecular order of the self-assembled P3HT nanofibres formed under the same ultrasonication conditions is the same in the solutions with or without GO. Namely, the molecular order of self-assembled P3HT nanofibres decreases with prolonged ultrasonication time.22 In low-Mw P3HT–GO-BCs, the molecular order of both the nucleated nanofibres and adsorbed nanofibres decreases with prolonged ultrasonication time, so the overall molecular order of P3HT–GO-BCs decreases with ultrasonication time. P3HT nanofibres with low molecular order prefer to be adsorbed on the GO surface. In the P3HT solution ultrasonicated for 10 min, the amount of self-assembled nanofibres is the highest, and the molecular order of the self-nanofibres is the lowest,22 resulting in the highest amount of adsorbed nanofibres on the GO surface. Moreover, ultrasonication improves the crystallization of P3HT on the GO surface, leading to the highest amount of GO-nucleated P3HT nanofibres being present in the P3HT solution ultrasonicated for 10 min. Consequently, the amount of P3HT nanofibres in low-Mw P3HT–GO-BCs increases with prolonged ultrasonication time. The A0–0/A0–1 ratios of low-Mw P3HT nanofibres and P3HT–GO-ACs for different ultrasonication times are shown in Fig. 8b. Among the three kinds of low-Mw P3HT nanofibres, the molecular order of those in P3HT–GO-BCs is the lowest, indicating that the contribution of the nucleation effect of GO in P3HT–GO-BCs is higher than that in P3HT–GO-ACs, which is similar to that of high-Mw P3HT/GO composites.

The amount of P3HT nanofibres in P3HT–GO-ACs for static crystallization is too low to be measured by UV-vis spectroscopy, so no A0–0/A0–1 ratio can be obtained.22 

Fig. 9a shows that the absorption intensity of the peak at ∼508 nm of low-Mw P3HT–GO-BCs is lower than that of P3HT–GO-ACs for the same ultrasonication time, indicating that the amount of P3HT nanofibres on the GO surface prepared by dipping the GO–Si wafer into the solution before ultrasonication (process B in Fig. 1) is lower than that prepared by dipping the GO–Si wafer into the completely crystallized P3HT solution (process A in Fig. 1), although the holding time in the solution is the same, 24 h. This result verifies that the nucleation effect is more dominant in P3HT–GO-BCs than in P3HT–GO-ACs; namely, the percent of the adsorbed nanofibres is relatively low, so the molecular order and the nanofibre content are lower. For both high-Mw and low-Mw P3HT–GO-BCs, the nucleation effect of GO is more dominant than that of P3HT–GO-ACs. Fig. 9b shows the normalized absorption spectra of low-Mw P3HT nanofibres, P3HT–GO-ACs and P3HT–GO-BCs ultrasonicated for 5 min. The absorption spectrum of P3HT–GO-BCs is broader than that of P3HT–GO-ACs, indicating that the charge-transfer interaction between P3HT and GO is different in P3HT–GO-BCs and P3HT–GO-ACs.

The amount of P3HT nanofibres in P3HT–GO-ACs under the static crystallization conditions is too low to be measured by UV-vis spectroscopy, so no intensity data were obtained.22 (b) Normalized absorption spectra of low-Mw P3HT nanofibres,22 P3HT–GO-ACs22 and P3HT–GO-BCs ultrasonicated for 5 min. 
To investigate the charge-transfer interactions between low-Mw P3HT nanofibres and GO, Raman measurements were employed, and the spectra are shown in Fig. 10. For P3HT nanofibres prepared with no GO, the CC peak was at 1449 cm−1. The CC peak shifts to higher frequencies of 1551 cm−1 for P3HT–GO-ACs and 1553 cm−1 for P3HT–GO-BCs, indicating that the molecular order of P3HT nanofibres in P3HT–GO-BCs is the lowest. The FWHM values of P3HT nanofibres, P3HT–GO-ACs and P3HT–GO-BCs were 27.3 cm−1, 27.9 cm−1 and 29.3 cm−1, respectively, verifying that the molecular order of the P3HT–GO-BCs is the lowest again. The Raman results were in accordance with the UV-vis results. The position of the G band varied significantly in P3HT/GO composites in comparison with that of pure GO films. The G band of the pure GO film is 1614 cm−1, and it shifts to 1610 cm−1 in P3HT–GO-ACs and 1598 cm−1 in P3HT–GO-BCs. This outcome verifies that the interfacial charge-transfer interaction between GO and P3HT can be modulated by different molecular orders and amounts of P3HT nanofibres. Istif et al. modulated the interaction between P3HTNPs and GO by varying the ratio of P3HT/GO.19 In this work, we found that choosing the appropriate time to mix GO and P3HT can effectively control the interfacial charge-transfer interaction between GO and P3HT nanofibres of both high-Mw and low-Mw P3HT in ultrasonicated solutions. It may be an easy method to open new pathways for the fabrication of improved optoelectronic thin film devices.

Conclusions
In this work, the effects of GO on the nanostructure of P3HT in P3HT/GO composites were investigated in detail for P3HT with different molecular weights in ultrasonicated solutions. For high-Mw P3HT–GO-BCs, the amount of P3HT nanofibres decreases, but the molecular order of the P3HT nanofibres increases with prolonged ultrasonication time. In comparison with high-Mw P3HT–GO-ACs, the amount of P3HT nanofibres is low, but the molecular order of the P3HT nanofibres is high under the same ultrasonication conditions. For low-Mw P3HT–GO-BCs, the amount of P3HT nanofibres increases, but the molecular order of the P3HT nanofibres decreases with prolonged ultrasonication time. In comparison with low-Mw P3HT–GO-ACs, both the amount and the molecular order of P3HT nanofibres in P3HT–GO-BCs are lower under the same ultrasonication conditions. The UV-vis spectra and Raman spectra verify that the variation in the amount and molecular order of P3HT nanofibres on the GO surface results in different charge-transfer interactions between GO and P3HT.
The interactions between P3HT and GO include the nucleation and the adsorption. For high-Mw P3HT–GO-BCs, the nucleation effects increase but the adsorption effects decrease with the prolongation of the ultrasonication time. For low-Mw P3HT–GO-BCs, both the nucleation effects and the adsorption effects increase with the prolongation of the ultrasonication time. In comparison with P3HT–GO-ACs, regardless of high-Mw and low-Mw, the nucleation effects in P3HT–GO-BCs are higher than those in P3HT–GO-ACs under the same ultrasonication conditions.
