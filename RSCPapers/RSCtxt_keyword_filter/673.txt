    , Accepted 23rd March 2023First published on 31st March 2023AbstractSynchronously achieving high power conversion efficiency (PCE) at low cost is a great challenge for the star hole transport material (HTM) spiro-OMeTAD-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) because of their expense. Three side-chain modified HTMs, spiro-mF-V, -A, and -P, are designed and synthesized. The incorporation of side chains, such as vinyloxy, allyloxy, and propargyloxy, effectively improves the hole mobility and matches the energy levels with the perovskite layer. All three HTMs show a high PCE of 23.7, 23.80, and 24.85% for spiro-mF-V, -A, and -P using a non-halogenated solvent, such as toluene for eco-friendly PSC fabrication. Furthermore, spiro-mF-V, -A, and -P exhibit good solubility and homogeneous film with smooth surface morphologies in a non-halogenated solvent system. In particular, the obtained PCE values exceed 23.7% at a low concentration in a non-halogenated system, which is one-third that of the spiro-OMeTAD-based PSCs. To the best of the authors' knowledge, it is the highest reported PCE for HTMs using non-halogenated solvents in PSCs. These findings show that the side chain engineering technique can produce novel HTMs for low-cost, environmentally friendly solvent processing.
Introduction
Solar energy as a renewable energy is considered one of the most strategic resources owing to its unlimited availability and pollution-free nature.1–3 Among the solar cells, the organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) became the most promising candidates for photovoltaic devices owing to the long carrier diffusion length, large absorption coefficient, tunable bandgap, high power conversion efficiency (PCE), and easy fabrication process.4–7 The certified PCE value of PSCs has improved quickly from 3.8% to 25.7% in just twelve years.8–10 To achieve excellent performance in the n-i-p architecture of PSCs, hole transport materials (HTMs) play a crucial role in hole extraction from the perovskite layers to HTMs. Thus far, the most widely used HTM is 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD). Pristine spiro-OMeTAD is not the ideal choice of HTM for PSCs due to the limits of low conductivity, hole mobility, cost-performance, etc.11–14 On the other hand, it has merits, such as forming smooth films, increasing molecular stability, high tolerance with dopants, and matching energy levels with perovskite.15–17 After doping engineering using dopants such as lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and tert-butyl-pyridine (tBP), hole mobility improved greatly, and spiro-OMeTAD has been the star HTM in PSCs.18–21 Based on the structure of spiro-OMeTAD, considerable effort has been made to optimize the performance of PSCs.19,22–25 For example, Jeon et al. applied a new peripheral fluorene unit to replace the p-anisole group of spiro-OMeTAD.26 Using this strategy, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels became deeper, which better matched the perovskite energy level than spiro-OMeTAD to achieve better performance. Considering the advantages of fluorination, Jeong et al. introduced fluorine into spiro-OMeTAD and developed two fluorinated isomeric derivatives, spiro-oF and spiro-mF.16 The energy levels were lowered and well-matched to those of perovskite because the fluorine atom has the strongest electronegativity, which can induce a dipole along the C–F bond, and hydrophobicity was greatly improved. In particular, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) (1.1814 V) of spiro-mF-based PSCs almost reached the Shockley–Queisser limit. Recently, Yang et al. developed spiro-Naph with asymmetric phenylnaphthylamine edge units based on the structure of spiro-OMeTAD, achieving high PCE and long-term stability.27 These excellent studies prompted the present study into new HTMs based on the structure of spiro-OMeTAD. According to previous reports, alkene and alkyne groups as π-linkers have an important influence on dye-sensitized, small-molecule organic solar cells and organic photovoltaic devices, which could optimize the electronic and optoelectronic properties.28–31 In addition, the strict coplanarity and rigidity characteristics of the alkene can result in high hole mobility, boost the intermolecular interactions and act as a stabilizer to block nanoparticle aggregation, promoting conductivity and homogeneity.28,32 Compared to the alkene group, alkynes, as ending linkages, are more accommodating to steric and conformational constraints owing to the quasi-cylindrical electronic symmetry.29 Although alkynes have relatively weak delocalization and charge stabilization, the rigid rod-like structures can still maintain the π-conjugation character. This is because the strong electron withdrawing effect of an alkyne can lead to a deep HOMO level with respect to the high Voc value in the PSCs.33 Based on the above merits, the present study designed and synthesized three new end group-engineered HTMs with spiro-OMeTAD derivatives: N2,N2′,N7,N7′-tetrakis(3-fluoro-4-methoxyphenyl)-N2,N2′,N7,N7′-tetrakis(4-(vinyloxy)phenyl)-9,9′-spiro-bi[fluorene]-2,2′,7,7′-tetraamine (spiro-mF-V), N2,N2′,N7,N7′-tetrakis(4-(allyloxy)phenyl)-N2,N2′,N7,N7′-tetrakis(3-fluoro-4-methoxyphenyl)-9,9′-spiro-bi[fluorene]-2,2′,7,7′-tetraamine (spiro-mF-A), and N2,N2′,N7,N7′-tetrakis(3-fluoro-4-methoxyphenyl)-N2,N2′,N7,N7'-tetrakis(4-(prop-2-yn-1-yloxy)phenyl)-9,9′-spiro-bi[fluorene]-2,2′,7,7′-tetraamine (spiro-mF-P), where mF stands for a meta-substituted fluorobenzene ring. Fluorine, alkene, and alkyne units were introduced into spiro-OMeTAD, which exhibits a deeper HOMO. The presence of end groups in the new HTM device caused little voltage loss and improved the hole mobility. P-Type dopants tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)cobalt(III)tri[bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide] (FK209), LiTFSI, and tBP were added to the HTM solution to overcome the relatively poor intrinsic conductivity and hole mobility of spiro-mF-V, -A, and -P.34,35 According to the report, non-halogenated solvents possess the ability to adjust the drying kinetics and fine-tune film morphology and are less harmful to the environment.36 In this study, non-halogenated toluene was used as a solvent to dissolve the HTMs, which is the first report of toluene as a solvent for spiro-OMeTAD derivative HTMs to achieve high PCE in PSCs to the best of the authors' knowledge. The HTMs show good solubility in toluene and exhibited good film formation on the perovskite layer. Finally, spiro-mF-V exhibited an excellent PCE of 23.70% with a Voc, short-circuit current density (Jsc) and FF of 1.162 V, 25.63 mA cm−2, and 79.57%, respectively. Meanwhile, the spiro-mF-A-based device achieved a good PCE of 23.80% with Voc = 1.156 V, Jsc = 25.91 mA cm−2 and FF = 79.46%. In particular, the spiro-mF-P-based device exhibited the best performance with the highest PCE of 24.85%, and exhibited a remarkable Voc of 1.174 V as well as a better Jsc (25.94 mA cm−2) and FF (81.62%) owing to the presence of a stronger electron-withdrawing alkyne end group. The above results show that end group engineering is one of the key strategies for developing eco-friendly solvent-processed PSCs.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a presents the molecular structures of spiro-OMeTAD, and spiro-mF-V, -A, and -P, and Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†) present the detailed synthetic routes. The target chemical structures of spiro-mF-V, -A, and -P were determined by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. S3–S5.† The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the HTMs were measured in degassed dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) at room temperature (RT), as shown in Fig. 1b. All four HTMs exhibited similar optical absorption bands at 260 nm to 430 nm, and no obvious absorption appeared in the visible region. This can be ascribed to the spiro center twisting the conformation and intercepting the conjugation, which is beneficial to the photon absorption of the perovskite layer and the expected optical properties of HTMs in PSCs.37 The introduction of fluorine, vinyloxy, allyloxy, and propargyloxy substituents in spiro-OMeTAD results in a slight red shift of π–π* absorption bands from 384 nm to 389 nm compared with those of spiro-OMeTAD.16,27,38 The optical bandgaps (Eg) of spiro-OMeTAD, and spiro-mF-V, -A, and -P were measured from the UV-vis absorption edges. In addition, the energy levels of perovskite and dopant HTM films were analyzed by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), as shown in Fig. 1c and d. The dopants were the same as those in the “fabrication of PSCs” in the ESI.†Fig. 1e shows the energy level diagrams of perovskites and HTMs. The HOMO of spiro-mF-P, -A, and -V, and spiro-OMeTAD, were −5.37, −5.33, −5.15, and −5.01 eV with work functions (WFs) of 3.18, 3.90, 3.61, and 3.71 eV, respectively. The detailed data are summarized in Table S1.† These tested results show that the rational design of the end group substituents in spiro-OMeTAD could produce a deeper HOMO level.16 Furthermore, the LUMO energy levels of spiro-mF-P, -A, and -V, and spiro-OMeTAD, were −2.37, −2.34, −2.20, and −2.00 eV, respectively. Among them, spiro-mF-P showed the deepest HOMO, which can be ascribed to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the alkyne derivatives. These results show that the introduction of fluorine, alkenyloxy, and alkynyloxy derivatives can optimize the new HTM energy levels to make them better match the perovskite rather than those of spiro-OMeTAD. Furthermore, the theoretical depiction concerning the hole-transporting behavior of the three spiro-OMeTAD derivatives was investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.19 According to the calculation results, the HOMO and LUMO for spiro-mF-V, -A, and -P were −4.33 eV & −0.82 eV, −4.40 eV & −0.93 eV, and −4.46 eV & −1.01 eV (Fig. S6†), respectively. These calculation results showed the same tendency as the UPS measurements.

Thermal properties of these three new HTMs were examined by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) under nitrogen (N2) conditions. As shown in Fig. 2a, the decomposition temperatures (Td) of 5% weight loss for spiro-mF-V, -A, and -P in the TGA curves were 416, 423, and 425 °C, respectively, which are high enough for applications in optoelectronic devices. The DTA curves show that all of these HTMs showed similar glass transition (Tg) and melting (Tm) temperatures (Fig. 2b). These results suggest that the thermostability of these three HTMs was high enough for their application in PSCs. In addition, the exothermic peaks of spiro-mF-V, -P, and -A were detected at 250, 260 and 319 °C (Fig. 2b (inside)), which can be attributed to the cross-linking reaction of the new HTMs. At the same time, the solutions of the new HTMs also showed noticeable color changes, from transparent to light yellow, and became viscous around 270 °C (Fig. 2c), as for spiro-mF-V, and -P, which were consistent with the DTA test results. On the other hand, there is a big difference between the solution annealing experiment and DTA test results for the cross-linking temperature of spiro-mF-A, and the specific reasons need to be further analyzed. Cross-linkable carrier transport materials can impart considerable humidity resistance, good thermal stability, and high efficiency, which will be explored further in future studies.39,40

The lower trap density and high crystalline quality of the perovskite film are crucial for suppressing nonradiative recombination and reducing moisture penetration to enhance the stability of PSCs. Compositional engineering of perovskite is an effective way to decrease the trap density and improve the crystalline quality, such as using methylammonium (MA+), Rb+, and Cs+ to partially replace the FA+ ions in cubic formamidinium lead iodide (α-FAPbI3).41–44 In this work, methylamine hydrochloride (MACl) was added to α-FAPbI3 to obtain high crystallinity perovskite films and further improve the photovoltaic performance. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to check the purity of phase and crystallinity of the pristine perovskite and perovskite/spiro-mF-V, -A, and -P films on FTO/TiO2 substrates. The pristine perovskite films showed active α-FAPbI3 perovskite diffraction peaks at around 14 and 28°, which corresponded to the crystal planes (001) and (002) as shown in Fig. 3a. In addition, no undesired phase peaks (δ-FAPbI3) appeared, showing that the perovskite had high crystal quality.41,45,46

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was studied to check the surface chemical states of perovskites and perovskite/HTM samples. As shown in Fig. 3b, there are two main peaks of perovskite at 138.8 and 143.6 eV, corresponding to the lead iodine component in perovskite Pb 4f7/2 and 4f5/2, respectively. Meanwhile, two additional weak peaks of perovskites which appeared at 137.0 and 142.0 eV were associated with metallic Pb0, which is related to the decomposition of the perovskite layer. In addition, all of the Pb 4f and I 3d peaks of the HTM-treated perovskite films showed visible shifts to higher binding energy compared to that of pristine perovskite (Fig. 3b and c). The shift peaks of Pb and I could be ascribed to interactions of HTMs with undercoordinated Pb2+ and I in the perovskite surface.47 Furthermore, ion migration is an important factor affecting the device stability. Accordingly, to confirm the ion migration of perovskite, we tested fresh and aged samples of perovskite/OAI and perovskite/OAI/HTMs, respectively (Fig. S7†). We confirmed the atomic ratio of I/Pb in the fresh perovskite treated with OAI and HTMs. The I/Pb atomic ratios of perovskite and spiro-mF-P, -A, -V are 3.3, 1.8, 1.8, and 2.2, respectively. Because of OAI passivation, the I/Pb ratio is a little higher than that of atomic ratio 3 in the perovskite layer. The I/Pb ratio of HTM treated perovskites is around 2, which can be attributed to the decomposition of perovskite to form PbI2.48,49 The I/Pb atomic ratio of aged perovskites and spiro-mF-P, -A, -V are 2.7, 2.4, 2.0, and 2.6, respectively. The above results show an increasing amount of I immigration from the perovskite to the HTM layer, which may lead to a large impact on the stability of devices.50 Furthermore, the F/N ratio increased from 1.5, 1.3, and 1.5 to 2.6, 2.7, and 2.1 for fresh to aged samples of spiro-mF-P, -A, and -V. Thus, it can confirm the migration of dopant Li-TFSI (Fig. S8†). To conclude, the main factor of device stability was related to the migration of ion and dopants into the HTM layer.51,52
The carrier mobilities of spiro-OMeTAD derivatives were tested using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method, and the detailed fabrication process is shown in the ESI.†19,53–55 The hole-only devices (HOD) were fabricated with the structures of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene (PEDOT:PSS)/doped (LiTFSI + tBP + FK209) HTMs/MoO3/Ag. SCLC analysis showed that the hole mobilities of the doped spiro-mF-P, -A, and -V are 1.13 × 10−2, 4.93 × 10−3, and 2.78 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which are higher than that of commercial spiro-OMeTAD (2.41 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) (Fig. S9a†). The photovoltaic performances of spiro-mF-V, -A, and -P based (as HTMs) PSCs were investigated by fabricating the devices with the following architecture: FTO/compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/perovskite/HTMs/Au under AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) one sun illumination. Fig. 4a shows the device structure. The ESI† provides details of the fabrication process and characterization. Fig. 4b presents the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of doped spiro-mF-V, -A, and -P, and spiro-OMeTAD based PSCs. Tables 1 and S2† list the photovoltaic parameters. After the optimization process, the spiro-OMeTAD-based PSCs show a maximum PCE of 23.63%, with a Jsc, Voc, and FF of 26.00 mA cm−2, 1.126 V, and 80.75%, respectively. Spiro-mF-P, -A, and -V-based PSCs achieved remarkable PCEs of 24.85%, 23.80%, and 23.70%, respectively; Voc of 1.174, 1.156, and 1.162 V, respectively; Jsc of 25.94, 25.91, and 25.63 mA cm−2, respectively; and FF of 81.62, 79.46, and 79.57%, respectively. The spiro-mF-P, -A, and -V-based PSCs showed a higher PCE than the commercial spiro-OMeTAD-based PSCs, which were attributed to the higher mobility, and the PCE distribution is shown in Fig. S9b.† Compared with the reference material spiro-OMeTAD-based PSCs, the Voc increased slightly, which can be attributed to the deeper HOMO levels of the new HTMs. In addition, the new HTMs also showed one of the highest efficiencies among the spiro-derivative HTMs in PSCs, as summarized in Table S3.† In the present study, toluene was used instead of chlorobenzene as a solvent for environmentally friendly device fabrication. All the new HTMs showed good solubility and a smooth surface morphology in toluene. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the new HTM-based PSCs exhibited the best performance using an eco-friendly solvent among all the HTMs reported earlier; Table S4† provides detailed information. Interestingly, achieving high PCEs, the concentrations of spiro-mF-V, -A, and -P (30 mg ml−1 in toluene) were only one-third of spiro-OMeTAD (90 mg ml−1 in chlorobenzene), which is more economically feasible for commercial production. Moreover, according to the hysteresis index (HI) equation HI = (PCERev − PCEFor)/PCERev, the HI values of the PSCs with spiro-mF-P, -A, and -V, and spiro-OMeTAD were 0.027, 0.045, 0.068, and 0.026, respectively, suggesting that all of them exhibited a less hysteretic behavior. In contrast, among the new HTMs, the spiro-mF-P-based device showed the most effective suppression of hysteresis, which was attributed to the excellent interfacial charge transferability, and low bulk and surface recombination. Fig. 4c exhibits the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra with different HTMs. Spiro-mF-P, -A, and -V exhibited approximately 93% peak transmission in the range of 350–780 nm, and the values were 25.69, 25.06, and 25.11 mA cm−2, respectively, which were consistent with the experimental J–V measurement. The EQE onset of the target was blue-shifted slightly, which was consistent with the tuned bandgap.

The film morphology and grain size of the pristine perovskite layer, spiro-mF-P, -A, and -V, and spiro-OMeTAD on FTO/TiO2 substrate films were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as displayed in Fig. S10.† The perovskite films showed a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 31.59 nm. Owing to the favorable film formation ability of spiro-mF-V, -A, and -P, and spiro-OMeTAD, the RMS roughness was 19.74, 18.02, 17.70, and 9.64 nm, and the corresponding thicknesses is 60, 60, 60 and 200 nm, respectively. These results suggest that the spiro-mF-V, -A, -P, and spiro-OMeTAD layers comprehensively covered the perovskite surface and showed good film formation. As a result, the good film morphology can reduce the interface traps significantly, which can suppress the recombination of the carrier, which is beneficial for obtaining a high FF for the PSC devices. Interestingly, the spiro-mF-P-based film showed the smallest RMS compared to the spiro-mF-V, and -A at low concentrations, ensuring the best FF and PCE. In addition, the spiro-OMeTAD-based film showed a small RMS, which could be attributed to the higher concentration. However, in the AFM pictures, we can see the existence of some voids, which can be attributed to the small amounts of secondary solvents (such as H2O) and may be detrimental to the stability of the device.56 From the top-view SEM images in Fig. S10,† the perovskite showed a homogeneous and pinhole-free polycrystalline morphology. Furthermore, the perovskite exhibited a large grain size and high crystallinity with an average grain size of 1232 nm. Cross-sectional SEM images of the FTO glass/c-TiO2/mp-TiO2/perovskite/HTMs revealed a superb crystalline perovskite layer, approximately 702 nm in thickness. All layers showed tightened contact, as shown in Fig. 4d. This was attributed to the close contact interface between the c-TiO2 and mp-TiO2/perovskite and perovskite/HTMs to improve the carrier mobility. The charge transport dynamics between perovskite and different HTMs were evaluated by performing steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy of the different HTMs deposited on perovskite films on FTO/c-TiO2/mp-TiO2 substrates. As shown in Fig. 4e, all the PL intensities were significantly quenched (above 95%) for all of the HTM-coated perovskite films compared to the pristine perovskite films, indicating the efficient hole extraction ability and exciton dissociation of all the HTMs. The TRPL was investigated further by using the charge dynamics, as shown in Fig. 4f. The fitted carrier lifetimes of pristine perovskite, perovskite/spiro-mF-P, -A, and -V, and perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD were 1717, 41.8, 44.2, 46.5, and 112 ns, respectively. The shortened lifetime of the perovskite/HTMs showed efficient charge transferability at the interface of perovskite and HTMs. Among them, the shortest decay lifetime of spiro-mF-P indicated the excellent hole extraction capability corresponding to the best photovoltaic performance. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out to explore the charge transfer process between the perovskite and HTM interface. Fig. S11† shows the Nyquist plots and the equivalent circuits of different doped HTM-based PSCs, which exhibited a single semicircle. In the equivalent circuits, Rs, Rrec, and constant phase element (CPE) corresponded to the series resistance of the devices, charge recombination resistance values, and constant phase element, respectively. The different HTM-based PSCs showed small Rs values, ranging from 22.6 to 28.02 Ω. Furthermore, all of the newly synthesized HTM-based PSCs showed higher Rrec values, suggesting a larger carrier recombination resistance, due mainly to the excellent carrier extraction ability and the fewer defect-assisted traps in the perovskite layer to suppress charge recombination.57,58 The spiro-mF-P-based device showed the largest Rrec value, corresponding to the best FF and PCE results.
HTMs are very important to keep the perovskite from moisture, and high hydrophobicity is favorable for achieving devices with long-term stability. The hydrophobicity of spiro-mF-V, -A, and -P, and spiro-OMeTAD on FTO glass/c-TiO2/mp-TiO2/perovskite on the substrates were analyzed using a water contact angle test. As shown in Fig. S12a,† spiro-mF-P, -V, and -A, and spiro-OMeTAD showed similar contact angles of 83°, 78°, 76°, and 78°, respectively. The long-term stability of the encapsulated and un-encapsulated PSCs was tested under open-air and N2 atmospheres, respectively. As shown in Fig. S12b,† the encapsulated devices show good stability under open-air conditions, and can maintain >90% of its initial PCE over 1000 h. Additionally, the un-encapsulated device can also retain >90% of its initial PCE over 600 h under N2 conditions (Fig. S12c†). It degraded a little faster than the encapsulated devices which could be attributed to hydrophilicity of HTMs and dopants accelerating the decomposition of the perovskite layer when testing the devices under open-air conditions.35,52 Overall, all of the new HTM-based devices showed relatively similar stability to that of spiro-OMeTAD, which is consistent with the hydrophobic nature.
Conclusions
Three new highly efficient HTMs were designed and synthesized for PSCs. Incorporating the end groups into HTMs helps to acquire a deeper understanding of the structural property affiliation of the spiro-OMeTAD-based HTMs. All spiro-mF-P, -A, and -V-based PSCs achieved impressive PCEs. Interestingly, the good hole mobility and the inclusion of strong electron-withdrawing alkyne groups in spiro-mF-P produced an outstanding surface morphology and a well-aligned energy level, thus exceeding the PCE of 24.85%. This is one of the highest reported PCEs over 24% using an environmentally non-halogenated solvent for HTMs in PSCs. Furthermore, high PCEs were observed at low concentrations (only one-third that of spiro-OMeTAD), making them more economical for future commercial applications. The results of this work highlight the impact of the end groups. Moreover, all three HTMs are suitable for non-halogenated solvent processed PSCs.
