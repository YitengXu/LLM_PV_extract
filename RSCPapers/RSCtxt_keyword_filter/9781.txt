A donor–acceptor compound was also synthesized via two successive C–H bond arylations at C4 and C7 positions of the 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole unit. One of the major achivements of this methodology arises from the fine modulation of the fluorescence wavelength with emission colors covering blue to red regions of the visible spectrum by the simple introduction of the suitable aryl group on the 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole unit.
Introduction
Organic functional materials are finding increasing number applications. Among them, π-systems of polycyclic aromatic or heteroaromatic compounds such as 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole and 2,1,3-benzoselenadiazole are being actively investigated as inexpensive replacements of traditional inorganic semiconductors for the development of organic light-emitting diodes (OLED),1 organic photovoltaics (OPV)2 and bioprobes for bioimaging analyses.3 These strong electron acceptor heterocycles represent a pivotal framework for the construction of organic donor–acceptor (D–A) dyes.4 As an example, in 2005, Ho et al. developed a new class of organics dyes (compound I) based on benzothiadiazole and benzoselenadiazole chromophores, which displayed a good power conversion efficiency (Fig. 1, left).5 Benzothiadiazoles are also used as acceptor units in donor acceptor (D–A) conjugated polymers, such as the polymer solar cell II (Fig. 1, middle).6

Despite these widespread applications of 4-aryl-substituted 2,1,3-benzoselenadiazoles and 2,1,3-benzoselenadiazoles, their syntheses remain challenging and often require multiple steps. Protocols involving bromination, followed by palladium catalyzed (Suzuki,7 Stille,8 or Hiyama7a,9) cross-coupling reactions are the most commonly employed methods (Fig. 2a). Negishi reactions using an organozinc reagent prepared from benzofurazan through a magnesiation with bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)magnesium–lithium chloride complex (TMP2Mg·2LiCl) followed by transmetalation with zinc chloride have also been reported (Fig. 2b).10 Since the discovery of the Pd-catalyzed C–H bond arylation of heteroarenes using aryl halides by Nakamura et al.11 and Otha et al.,12 this methodology has emerged as one of the most reliable procedures for the eco-friendly formation of C–C bonds, for the access to a wide variety of arylated heterocycles.13 In 2013, Marder et al. reported the first example of C–H bond activation of 5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole using 10 mol% Pd(OAc)2 associated with 20 mol% di-tert-butyl(methyl)phosphonium tetrafluoroborate (Fig. 2c).14 However, 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole was not reactive under these reaction conditions, demonstrating the huge impact of the fluorine atom in Pd-catalyzed C–H arylations via the concerted-metalation deprotonation pathway.15 This C–H bond protocol was then applied in polymerization using dibromobenzene derivatives16 and for the synthesis of organic dyes containing electron-rich (donor) and electron-poor (acceptor) sections.17 An example of direct arylation at C4 position of 5-fluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole has also been reported.18 Later, Marder et al. extended the substrate scope to other electron deficient 2,1,3-benzoselenadiazoles such as 5,6-dicyano- and 5,6-dinitro-substituted ones (Fig. 2d).19 To the best of our knowledge, there is no report on direct arylation via a metal-catalyzed C–H bond activation of unsubstituted 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole and 2,1,3-benzoselenadiazoles. Recently, we disclosed that phosphine-free palladium acetate catalyzes the C–H bond arylation of benzofurazan (Fig. 2e).20 Therefore, we decided to investigate the reactivity of unsubstituted 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole and 2,1,3-benzoselenadiazole in palladium-catalyzed C–H bond arylation to gain the straightforward access to 4-arylated 2,1,3-benzothiadiazoles and 2,1,3-benzoselenadiazoles (Fig. 2e).

Results and discussion
Based on our recent results on palladium-catalyzed direct arylation of benzofurazan using aryl bromides as the aryl source,20 we examined the reactivity of 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (Table 1). Using our previously reported reaction conditions, namely, 1 mol% Pd(OAc)2 in the presence of KOAc in DMA at 120 °C, no reaction occurred between 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole and 4-bromobenzonitrile (Table 1, entry 1). Using a higher reaction temperature (i.e. 150 °C), arylated 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole 1, resulting from C–H bond activation at the C4 position, was obtained with 52% yield (Table 1, entry 2). When the reaction was performed in the presence of K2CO3 as the base, no reaction occurred, while the use of potassium pivalate (PivOK) and potassium adamantane-1-carboxylate (AdCO2K) allowed the formation of 1 with 84% and 65% yields, respectively. Other palladium sources were also evaluated (Table 1, entries 6–8). PdCl2 displayed the reactivity similar to that of Pd(OAc)2 as the arylated product 1 was isolated in 82% yield (Table 1, entry 6). Palladium dimer complex [Pd(C3H5)Cl]2 gave a slightly lower yield of 1, which was 72% (Table 1, entry 7). Diphosphine palladium catalysts, such as PdCl(C3H5)(dppb), did not increase the yield compared to the phosphine-free procedure (Table 1, entry 8).

With the best conditions in hand, namely, 1 mol% phosphine-free Pd(OAc)2 associated with PivOK as the base in DMA at 150 °C, we paid close attention to the scope of the reaction (Scheme 1). First, we examined the reactivity of para-substituted aryl bromides. Electron-deficient 4-bromonitrobenzene, 4-bromobenzaldehyde, ethyl 4-bromobenzoate, 4-bromopropiophenone and 4-bromobenzophenone reacted efficiently to deliver the 4-arylated 2,1,3-benzothiadiazoles 2–6 in 65–74% yields. However, 1-bromo-4-chlorobenzene displayed a lower reactivity as the desired product 7 was isolated in only 55% yield due to the formation of a side product arising from the homocoupling of this aryl bromide. It should be noted that under these reaction conditions, the C–Cl bond did not react. Bromobenzene, 1-bromo-4-(tert-butyl)benzene and 4-bromoanisole have been successfully employed in this phosphine-free palladium coupling to afford 8–10 in 60–65% yields. A meta-substituent on the aryl bromide had almost no effect as the desired arylated products 11–14 were obtained in good yields from 3-bromobenzonitrile, 1-bromo-3-(trifluoromethyl)benzene, 3-bromonitrobenzene, and 1-bromo-3-chlorobenzene. The reaction was almost not sensitive to the steric hindrance as the ortho-substituted aryl bromides such as 2-bromobenzonitrile and 2-bromobenzaldehyde afforded the desired products 15 and 16, respectively, in good yields. Furthermore, 1,3-benzodioxol motif was introduced on the 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole 17, which was isolated with a 45% yield from 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole and 5-bromo-1,3-benzodioxole. Then, in order to show the potential of this method for the preparation of organic materials, we employed some π-extended aryl bromides as coupling partners. 2-Bromonaphthalene was efficiently coupled with 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole affording 18 in 60% yield; its X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the structure.21 3-Bromofluorene and 1-bromopyrene smoothly reacted, allowing the formation of 4-arylated 2,1,3-benzothiadiazoles 19 and 20 in 56% and 43% yields, respectively. N-Containing heteroaryl bromides (e.g., 2-bromo-6-methoxypyridine, 2-bromo-6-(trifluoromethyl)pyridine, or 3-bromoquinoline) also nicely reacted to afford the desired products 21–23 in good yields.

Next, we investigated the formation of symmetrical 4,7-diaryl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazoles (Scheme 2). Using 3 equivalents of 1-bromo-4-chlorobenzene and 1 equivalent of 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole in the presence of 1 mol% Pd(OAc)2 associated with 3 equivalents of PivOK in DMA at 150 °C, we were pleased to isolate 4,7-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (24) as the major product in 64% yield. From 1-bromo-3-(trifluoromethyl)benzene and 1-bromo-3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzene, 4,7-bis(aryl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazoles 25 and 26 were synthesized in good yields. The regioselectivity of the diarylation was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis of 26.21

Using this methodology, we also carried out the straightforward synthesis of an unsymmetrical 4,7-diaryl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole via two successive Pd-catalyzed C–H bond arylations (Scheme 3). Starting from 17, a second arylation using 1-bromo-3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzene afforded the 4,7-unsymmetrical diaryl 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (28) in 38% yield, which should display push–pull properties.

Syntheses of selenium containing compounds and the further utilization of these compounds in organic synthesis for the preparation of organic materials have attracted less attention.22 Although a wide variety of thiadiazole containing compounds are known, only a limited number of selenadiazoles containing compounds have been prepared.23 Therefore, we turned our attention to the reactivity of 2,1,3-benzoselenadiazole in Pd-catalyzed C–H bond arylation (Scheme 4). For these reactions, we employed the same reaction conditions used for the direct arylation of 2,1,3-benzothiadaziole, namely, 1 mol% Pd(OAc)2 associated with PivOK as the base in DMA at 150 °C. Using 4-bromobenzonitrile, 1-bromo-4-(tert-butyl)benzene and 1-bromo-3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzene, we successfully prepared the 4-aryl-2,1,3-benzoselenadiazoles 28–30 in 52–57% yields. The regioselectivity of the arylation of 2,1,3-benzoselenadiazole was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis of 30.21 It should be noted that the reactions with 2,1,3-benzoselenadiazole were more sluggish than the reactions with 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole, resulting in some unidentified decomposition products, which might explain the reason for obtaining arylated products in lower yields.

Finally, in order to determine the scope of these new compounds as chromophores, preliminary photophysical studies were conducted. UV-visible absorption spectra of the mono-substituted 9, 17, 19, and 20 and the di-substituted 24, 26, and 27 2,1,3-benzothiadiazoles, and the benzoselenadiazole derivative 29 were recorded in a dichloromethane solution at room temperature (see Fig. 3 and 4); the corresponding data are summarized in Table 2. As a common feature for all the investigated compounds, their electronic absorption spectra exhibited a characteristic set of absorption bands for benzothiadiazole and benzoselenadiazole derivatives with intense and well-resolved absorption bands in the UV region, from 250 to 350 nm, together with a moderately intense and broad absorption band tailing up in the visible region of the spectrum. The mono-substituted 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole 9, bearing a tert-butyl group on the aryl substituent was considered as a reference compound for the studied series.24 The absorption spectrum of 9 shows a broad band centered at 250 nm and well-resolved bands from 280 to 325 nm in the UV region, while at lower energy a weaker and broad band which tails up to 420 nm is observed (Fig. 3). According to previous studies, the UV absorption bands of 9 arise from 1(π–π*) transitions of the p-tert-butylphenyl substituent and the benzothiadiazole core, respectively.24c At lower energy (from 325 to 420 nm), the broad absorption band is assigned to charge transfer transition (CT) from the electron-donating aryl substituent to the π*-accepting benzothiadiazole moiety.24c Replacing the p-tert-butylaryl substituent by the benzodioxole in 17 red-shifts the CT transition by 50 nm as a result of larger electron-donating properties of the dioxole group. In comparison with 9, the fluorene-based 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole 19 exhibits higher absorptivity within the entire spectrum due to additional 1(π–π*) transitions of this π-extended system, but with no significant shift of the absorption bands. Similarly, replacing the fluorenyl (19) by a pyrenyl group (20) leads to very intense absorption bands in the UV region; the absorption profile of the benzothiadiazole core are overlapped by the intense and well-resolved absorption bands of the pyrene moiety. The pyrene moiety in 20 induces a small red-shift of the CT band (Δλ = 15 nm) as compared to the fluorene substituent in 19. Based on previous experimental and theoretical studies of benzothiadiazole derivatives, the observed spectral changes by incorporation of various aromatic substituents can be interpreted as a modification of the highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), while the lowest-unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), centered on the core, stays almost unchanged.24c In other words, increasing the electron-richness (17) and/or extension of the π-system (19, 20) destabilizes the HOMO energy level, resulting in a decrease of the HOMO–LUMO gap with respect to 9. As far as the di-substituted 2,1,3-benzothiadiazoles are concerned, compounds bearing two p-chlorophenyl groups (24) or two 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)aryl groups (26) exhibit similar absorption profiles, but with a blue-shift of the charge-transfer band in 24 as compared to 26; this is attributed to the strong electron-withdrawing CF3 groups (Fig. 4). As expected, the compound 27 shows the lowest-energy CT band centered at 400 nm due to the presence of both electron-donating dioxole substituent and electron-accepting (CF3)2Ar and benzothiadiazole groups, which give rise to strong charge-transfer transitions.

Interestingly, the seleno-derivative 29 displays an absorption profile similar to its sulfur analogue 9 with absorption bands corresponding to 1(π–π*) transitions on the tert-butylphenyl substituent of the benzoselenodiazole core and at lower-energy, a moderately intense band arising from the charge-transfer transition (Fig. 3). Notably, compared with 9, the seleno-derivative 29 exhibits a large red-shift of the absorption bands belonging to the benzoselenodiazole core and a moderate bathochromic effect of the CT transitions, which is a feature in agreement with previous reports on related benzoselenodiazole compounds.23b,25
The emission spectra of 9, 17, 19, 20, 24, 26, 27 and 29 are shown in Fig. 5 and the emission data are compiled in Table 2. Except compound 20, all the investigated compounds are strongly emissive in dichloromethane solution at room temperature. Remarkably, they exhibit good to excellent photoluminescence quantum yield (ϕ) in solution (as high as 90%) (19) irrespective of the nature of the substituent (Fig. 6). Interestingly, the emission color changes from blue (λem = 449 nm for 26) to red (λem = 555 nm for 27) in the visible spectrum, strongly depending on the nature of the incorporated aryl group on the benzothiadiazole core. The emission wavelength was fine-tuned by changing the electronic richness of the system and/or by introducing an extended π-system (fluorene, pyrene) as well as by replacing the sulfur atom by Se (9vs.29). The emission can be controlled by the CT transitions. For instance, the multi-polar derivative 27 displays the more red-shifted emission consistently with CT absorption bands at lower-energy. However, this red-shifted fluorescence is accompanied with a decrease of the photoluminescence quantum yield (ϕ = 19%), which is in agreement with the energy gap law. Compounds 9 and 26 display a blue emission, while 17 and 19 bearing an electron donating aryl or a fluorenyl group, respectively, display an orange-red emission. The benzoselenodiazole 29 displays luminescence with a maximum at 503 nm, which is red-shifted by about 35 nm with respect to the analogue 9; this feature is comparable to that reported for related benzoselenodiazole compounds (Fig. 5).23b,25

It should be noted that compound 20 is non-emissive in fluid solution. This behavior can be explained by the presence of the pyrenyl group since pyrenes are known to be subjected to self-quenching through the formation of aggregates or excimers in solution. Interestingly, the luminescence of 20 can be turned-on in the solid state. The solid-state fluorescence, measured on a drop casted film at 298 K (from dichloromethane solution) is characterized by a broad emission band centered at 530 nm, which probably originated from the excimer state (Fig. 7).26

Conclusions
In summary, 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole and 2,1,3-benzoselenadiazole can be efficiently arylated at C4/C7 positions via palladium catalyzed C–H bond activation. Simple phosphine-free palladium acetate and KOAc as the base in DMA were found to be the best reaction conditions. A wide range of functional groups such as methoxy, chloro, formyl, propionyl, benzoyl, ester, nitrile, trifluoromethyl or nitro on the aryl bromide were tolerated. Some sterically hindered, π-extended and heteroaromatic aryl bromides were also successfully employed, demonstrating the potential of this methodology for the preparation of organic materials. Interestingly, this method allows the introduction of aryl substituents with different electronic properties in one step, resulting in a fine modulation of the fluorescence wavelength with emission colors covering blue to red regions of the visible spectrum. The combination of these photophysical effects makes such materials particularly interesting for photovoltaic and OLED applications.
