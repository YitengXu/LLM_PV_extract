    , Accepted 28th April 2017First published on 29th April 2017AbstractA new conjugated polymer utilizing diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) and benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) units as the backbone framework was designed, synthesized, and applied in polymer solar cells. A high efficiency of 9.18% was obtained using phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as acceptor, which was among the best results obtained for DPP-based photovoltaic polymers. Absorption spectra indicated that the new polymer exhibits a narrow optical band-gap and strong aggregation behavior in the solution state. It was found that by dissolving the donor and acceptor in different solvents and then mixing them before film casting, better performing solar cell devices and distinct film morphology could be achieved, rather than by dissolution in one solvent. Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) profiles showed that PC71BM in solution impaired polymer aggregate formation, because of its favorable interaction with the polymer chain. This study demonstrated the importance of manipulating the aggregation state in bulk heterojunction solar cell fabrication and revealed the influence of polymer-fullerene interplay on the blend film morphology.
Introduction
Since its inception, the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) device has been the leading type of polymer solar cells (PSC) and much effort has been devoted to controlling the morphology of the active layer and relating the morphology to the photovoltaic performance.1–3 The so-called “ideal” morphology refers to a bi-continuous interpenetrating network with hierarchical nanomorphologies, involving the purity and size of domain, crystallization and/or aggregation behaviour, the miscibility between the donor and acceptor, and the molecular orientation, and so on.4–10 The subtle variation in film morphology exerts a significant impact on the photovoltaic process involved and thereby determines the final power conversion efficiency (PCE). Many morphology-optimizing methods have been investigated to elucidate how the film morphology dictates photovoltaic performance, and indeed elevated the devices' PCE.11–16 However, the morphology arises from the competition of multiple kinetic processes, and achieving the desired miscibility and phase separation of the component is challenging.
In many cases, the characteristic feature of a conjugated polymer to aggregate or self-assemble via π–π stacking plays a significant role in determining the morphology of the blend film. This structure can be translated from a late drying status of BHJ solution to a fully dried film. Thus, the aggregation state of conjugated polymers has gained considerable attention from researchers, and many achievements have been seen over the past few years in utilizing polymer aggregation in solution to control the film morphology and enhance device performances.17–20 This aggregation behaviour depends on multiple variables, including chemical structure,17,21 molecular weight,22,23 concentration,24 solvent,25,26 and temperature.27,28 However, the interaction between the conjugated polymers and small molecules, such as [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), has been neglected and this has led to an uncompleted understanding of the polymer aggregation in solution.
Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based conjugated polymers have emerged as promising low bandgap donors for application in PSCs by virtue of the good charge transport properties and wide absorption spectra. By alternating the electron-deficient DPP units and many electron rich moieties along the conjugated chain, the optical band gap and energy levels of the DPP-based polymers can be easily adjusted and designed.29 However, by contrast, the blend morphology of the photoactive layer is poorly understood and predicted. For semicrystalline polymers such as DPP-based compounds, the polymer aggregates in the dilute solution during solvent evaporation, whereas the fullerene is still dissolved and will then solidify and imbed in the mesh between the crystalline aggregates.30,31 Thus, to a great extent, the polymer fiber framework formed orients the final morphology of blend film. Many researchers have correlated the polymer crystalline behaviour and fiber width with the photovoltaic parameters and optoelectronic conversion of the corresponding PSC devices.31 Many factors including the co-solvent type and amount, molecular weight and structure have been demonstrated to influence the fibre width and lead to different fibril morphologies and photovoltaic performance.31–33 These make DPP-based conjugated polymers good models for studying the morphology–property relationship.
In this paper, the design and synthesis of a new conjugated polymer (named P266, and shown in Scheme 1) utilizing benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) and DPP units as the backbone framework based on the donor–acceptor strategy is reported. Our results from evaluating the absorption spectra indicated that the newly synthesized polymer showed pronounced temperature-dependent aggregation in the solution state. Thus, two methods were adopted to prepare the blend solution of the donor and the acceptors. At first, blending P266 and PC71BM together in solution under high temperature overnight (conventional preparation method) resulted in an inferior device performance with a PCE of 7.37%. Alternatively, dissolving P266 and PC71BM in different solvents, followed by a mixing procedure at low temperature before BHJ thin film casting, led to significantly improved photovoltaic performance (scheme shown in Fig. 1). The best device showed a PCE over 9% because of the improved fill factor (FF) and short circuit current density (Jsc). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization indicated that the preparation method has a profound impact on the blend film morphology, which may explain the improved charge transport and enhanced photovoltaic performance. The results demonstrated the influence of PC71BM in regulating polymer assembly in solution and this needs to be accounted for in developing a suitable structure–property relationship.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of polymer
The synthetic details of P266 are illustrated in Scheme 1 and Experimental section. The BDD monomer was synthesized as described previously.34 Polymer P266 was prepared using a palladium (Pd)-catalyzed Stille coupling reaction between BDD monomers and DPP monomers. The molecular weight was determined using gel permeation chromatography with polystyrene standards for calibration. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) of P266 is 118 k with a polydispersity index of 2.73. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to evaluate the thermal stability of the polymer, and the thermal decomposition temperature (Td) at 5% weight loss of the polymer was 395 °C.
The absorption spectra of P266 are shown in Fig. 2a, showing an absorption peak at 694 nm with a maximum extinction coefficient of 8.2 × 104 cm−1. The film absorption onset is 850 nm which corresponds to a low optical bandgap of 1.46 eV. The aggregation behaviour in solution of P266 was studied using temperature dependent absorption spectra in dilute chlorobenzene (CB) solution. When the temperature was lowered, a shoulder peak at the long wavelength region was observed, suggesting a more intense π–π interaction arising from interchain backbone stacking. In addition, from 120 °C to 20 °C, the absorption edge red shifted approximately 50 nm, also implying that there was tighter interchain packing.

Frontier energy levels of P266, including the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels, were evaluated using electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. The HOMO and LUMO levels were calculated from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials according to established protocols.35 As shown in Fig. 2c, P266 has a HOMO of −5.35 eV, a LUMO of −3.50 eV and an electrochemical bandgap of 1.85 eV.
Device processability and photovoltaic performance
PSC devices were fabricated using a conventional architecture indium tin oxide/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate/active layer/magnesium/aluminium (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Mg/Al). The donor/acceptor (D/A) weight ratios and amount of additive were optimized to achieve the best performances (see ESI† for details). It was found that the using 3 vol% diphenyl ether (DPE) as the additive,36 setting the D/A ratio of 1:2 and controlling the film thickness at 100 nm could achieve the best performance. P266 aggregated strongly as discussed previously and was difficult to dissolve at low temperatures, thus a heating treatment of the blend solution was necessary. Using the conventional route of dissolving all the components in CB at 120 °C, a PCE of 7.37% was obtained in the corresponding device, namely, Device I.
As found previously,17,27 polymer dissolution and aggregation depends greatly on the solution heating conditions.
The presence of PC71BM may disturb the well developed polymer fibrils when the interchain stacking of the polymer is weak under high temperature, leading to less organized fibrils and, therefore, a less organised network. As an alternative route for device fabrication, P266 was first dissolved in CB under high temperature. Then, a solution of PC71BM in CB was added to the P266 solution after cooling the hot polymer solution to 40 °C, then the mixture was stirred again and spin-coated in a short time. This procedure avoided mixing P266 with PC71BM under elevated temperatures, and the intense aggregates of conjugated polymer remained intact, so that, upon spin-coating, the aggregates developed a better defined network. The other fabricating conditions remained the same as the conventional route, including the D/A weight ratio, solution concentration, film thickness, additive feed ratio and spin-coating temperature. Fig. 3a and Table 1 show the current density–voltage (J–V) curves and detailed device parameters. The device prepared using the solution mixing method, namely, Device II, showed a maximal PCE of 9.18% with a remarkable FF of 0.704 and a Jsc of 18.11 mA cm−2. Furthermore, better reproducibility was also achieved.

External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are shown in the inset of Fig. 3a. The integrated Jsc values from the EQE spectra for Devices I and II were 16.33 mA cm−2 and 17.45 mA cm−2, respectively, and these results are in good agreement with the J–V measurements. A maximum EQE value of 65% was observed at 470 nm which arose from the contribution of both donor and acceptor excitons. Thus, the new polymer P266 and PC71BM in a fibrillary network morphology could effectively harvest solar radiation concurrently.
PSC devices with thick active layers lead to absorb sufficient amounts of solar energy, and thus, are suitable for roll-to-roll printing in the manufacture of large area modules.21,37,38 By tuning the solvent concentration (from 6 mg mL−1 to 8 mg mL−1) and spin-coating speed, PSC devices were prepared using the solution mixing method with film thicknesses varying from 100 to 340 nm and all the devices with film thickness ranging from 100 to 300 nm showed PCEs above 8%. The detailed J–V curves can be found in the ESI.† It is worth noting that a maximum Jsc value of 21.32 mA cm−2 could be obtained in a 305 nm thick device, which contributed to a PCE of 8.28% despite the dramatically decreased FF.
Charge generation, recombination and transport
The investigation of the generation of excitons and the dissociation process could be determined using the photocurrent values extracted from the J–V curves under the light and dark conditions. Fig. 3b shows the photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) characteristics for the two types of devices. Veff is defined as V0 minus V, where V0 is the voltage when Jph = 0 and V is the applied bias during the J–V test. Jph is the difference of the current density measured under the light and dark conditions. The saturation current density (Jsat) and exciton dissociation probabilities (Pdiss) under short circuit conditions were, 19.2 mA cm−2 and 88.8%, respectively, for Device I, and 20.1 mA cm−2, and 90.2%, respectively, for Device II. These results suggest that exciton dissociation and charge extraction are more efficient in the devices prepared using the solution mixing method.
More insight into the charge recombination dynamics of these two types of devices was gained by probing the dependence of Jsc and Voc at various light intensities.39,40 A power law dependence between Jsc and light intensity, Plight, can be described as Jsc ∼ PlightS. The exponents, S, both are 0.99 for the devices prepared by the two different routes. Because weak bimolecular recombination would result in a linear dependence of Jsc on light intensity, the same S values of 0.99 suggests that this recombination mechanism is almost negligible in both devices. For Voc, the slope of Voc ∼ ln(Plight) can be used to determine the degree of trap-assisted recombination at the open circuit condition in the devices. In principle, a slope of kBT/q where kB is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature and q is the elementary charge, indicates that bimolecular recombination is dominant and trap-assisted recombination is rather minor. For a device with dominant trap-assisted recombination, the slope was 2kBT/q. Here, the Device II showed a slope close to kBT/q, whereas that for the devices prepared using the conventional method was 1.2kBT/q. Based on the previous analysis, it can be concluded that in the devices fabricated using the solution mixing method, trap-assisted recombination was obviously suppressed, significantly enhancing FF and PCE.
Given that a relationship between charge carrier transport and photovoltaic performance have been demonstrated, the underlying difference of these two devices was further explored by comparing hole mobilities (μh). The space charge limited current method was used to estimate the hole mobilities, and the architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au was utilized to construct hole only devices. The Mott–Gurney Law was adopted to fit the J–V characteristics, where Au was the gold electrode.41 The device fabricated using the conventional method had an average hole mobility of 3.22 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, whereas that for the device fabricated using the solution mixing method was 1.40 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, almost one order of magnitude larger. Because no significant difference of the two devices was seen in the bimolecular recombination as discussed previously, these results suggest that the inferior hole transport originates from the traps in the device prepared using the conventional route.
Film morphology
The morphology of BHJ thin films were investigated using TEM, as shown in Fig. 4 where tiny fibrils were observed, whose assembly formed the continuous hole transportation domains (bright region) (see Fig. 4). The fibril width of the two samples were similar, approximately 10–20 nm, which may be attributed to the DPE used as additive.31,32 The blend film spin-coated from the conventional method showed a homogeneous interpenetrating network fibril structure, which was consistent with previous reports of DPP-based PSCs.31,33 However, the sample prepared using the solution mixing method showed a very different profile of fiber network. Specifically, the polymer fibrils tended to aggregate together, and form fibril bundles.
 Fig. 4  TEM images of (a and c) thin films prepared using the conventional method and (b and d) thin films prepared using the solution mixing method. The scale bar is (a and b) 500 nm, and (c and d) 200 nm. 
Meanwhile, fullerene also aggregated as demonstrated by the darker and larger fullerene phase in the right images, which implied the more severe phase separation, whereas fullerene molecules were distributed homogeneously in the mesh of the polymer network in the other sample. There is reason to believe that the strong aggregation of polymers and insufficient interaction between the polymer and small molecules in the prepared solution may account for the distinct film morphology.
Meanwhile, the absorption spectra of the blend films prepared using the two solution preparation method (as shown in Fig. S5; ESI†) were also compared. Both the redshifted absorption edge and stronger shoulder peak suggest that the polymer aggregation is enhanced, or rather, retained using the new preparation method.
The crystalline structure of spin-cast thin film was investigated using grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD), and the data are shown in Fig. 5. It can be seen that the pure polymer film showed a face-on orientation with a strong π–π stacking peak shown in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction. The (100) peak in in-plane (IP) direction located at ∼0.30 A−1, gave a distance of 2.1 nm. The crystal coherence length (CCL) was estimated to be 7.5 nm. The signal of the π–π stacking located at 1.65 A−1, gave a distance of 0.38 nm. The samples prepared using conventional and solution mixing methods showed similar diffraction features. It was shown from the IP diffraction profiles that the (100) CCLs for the two samples were 9.5 and 9.9 nm, respectively. The IP direction (100) CCL should be related to the fibril width found using TEM. A similar size in this dimension indicates that fibril bundles in the samples prepared from the solution method consisted of similar crystalline fibrils to those obtained using solution drying method. The aggregates in solution are responsible for the agglomeration of fibrils, and do not contribute the fibril size. The results showed that the temperature variation in the blend solution preparation can modulate domain size without changing the crystalline behavior, which is similar to that found in previous research.27 However, a reasonable explanation for why the crystalline behavior was not changed has not yet been determined and this will need further study.

Polymer aggregation in the solution state
From the results of the TEM characterization, it can be inferred that in the hot solution, the interchain interaction, i.e., π–π stacking, of the conjugated polymer was weakened, and it was easier to disperse the PC71BM into the loose mesh of the polymer fibril. The interplay between the small molecules and polymer chains impaired the strong aggregation and thus influenced the final film morphology. The aggregation behavior of P266 was evident in the temperature dependent absorption studies. In order to further confirm this inference, small angle neutron scattering (SANS) characterization was used to evaluate the influence of PC71BM on the aggregation of P266.42Fig. 6 shows the SANS profiles of P266 and BHJ blends in deuterated CB solution at 60 °C. This temperature was slightly higher than that used in the spin-coating processes to prevent the polymer from gelling during the long-term experiment. It can be seen that the pure polymer solution has an up-turn in the low q region, indicating the formation of aggregates in solution. A Guinier analysis does not yield a consistent radius of gyration indicating that the size scale of the aggregates is beyond the instrumental resolution. Nonetheless, these aggregates persist as the solvent evaporates and are the origins of the fibril texture observed in the thin films. With the addition of PC71BM, the size scale of the aggregates has clearly decreased, as is evident from the reduction in the scale at small q, reflecting the favorable interactions with polymer chains. It has been shown that PC71BM can be mixed well with conjugated polymers and thus functions as a solute, which results in a decrease in the aggregate size and more polymers favored homogeneous dispersion in the solution. The results acquired from the SANS profile were in good agreement with the results of the film morphology characterization. Therefore, use of the solution mixing preparation method avoided the adverse PC71BM–polymer interaction and protected the strong aggregation of the polymer during the dissolution process. Thus, an improved film morphology and photovoltaic performance can be anticipated.

Conclusions
In conclusion, a new polymer donor P266 with low band-gap was developed. This material was prepared by copolymerizing BDD and DPP units. After carefully optimizing the fabrication of the devices, the PSC devices based on polymer P266 and PC71BM showed a maximal PCE of 9.18%, which is among the best results for DPP-based photovoltaic polymers. In addition, a new device fabrication method, coupled with the strong aggregation of the polymers, was developed by manipulating the polymer–PC71BM interaction. In comparison with the conventional preparation method, this solution mixing method that utilized preformed polymer aggregates in mild-temperature solution could induce robust polymer fibril bundles and more distinct phase separation, which may help to reduce the charge recombination, improve charge transport and thus enhance both Jsc and FF in the solar cell device. The solution aggregation and thin film morphology were carefully investigated, providing a detailed structure–property relationship. This study showed the importance of manipulating the aggregation state in BHJ solar cell fabrication and revealed the influence of polymer-fullerene interplay on the blend film morphology.

Fabrication of the PSC devices
The PSC devices were fabricated in the conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Mg/Al. The fabrication process was performed using the following procedures: ITO glass was cleaned with a surfactant scrub, and then washed successively with water, acetone and isopropanol. Then, the ITO surfaces were treated with ultraviolet (UV) ozone cleaner for 15 minutes. PEDOT:PSS was then spin-coated onto the ITO glass (∼35 nm thick film) and dried on an oven at 150 °C for 15 min. The solution of polymer:PC71BM (6 mg mL−1, based on the polymer weight concentration) in CB was spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer. The Mg (20 nm) and Al (80 nm) as the electrode were successively deposited onto the active layer under high vacuum, giving an effective cell area of 3.7 mm2. Except for the spin-coating of PEDOT:PSS, the other processes were carried out in a glovebox under a nitrogen atmosphere.

The absorption spectra of the polymers in solution at various temperatures and solid thin films were measured on a Hitachi UH4150 UV-Visible spectrophotometer. The CV scans were recorded on a CH Instruments 650D electrochemical workstation, and the glassy carbon, platinum wire, and silver (Ag/Ag+) electrode were used as working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively.

TEM images were obtained using a Jeol JEM-2100FS instrument at 160 kV accelerating voltage in bright field mode. The J–V tests were carried out under the illumination of 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G using a SAN-EI Electric XES-70S1 solar simulator (AAA grade) calibrated with a standard single crystal silicon (Si) photovoltaic cell (certificated by the National Institute of Metrology). The EQE data was collected using an Enlitech QE-R3011 integrated incident photon to charge carrier efficiency (IPCE) measurement system. TGA analysis was carried out on Shimadzu DTG-60H.
GIXD characterization of the active layer was performed using the Beamline 7.3.3, Advanced Light Source, at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. X-ray energy was 10 keV and operated in the top off mode. The samples were ∼10 mm long in the direction of the beam path, and the detector was located at a distance of 300 mm from the sample center (distance calibrated using a silver boride reference). The incidence angle was chosen to be 0.16° (above the critical angle) for the entire film structure measurement. An incidence angle of 0.12° (below the critical angle) was used to probe the very top surface. Organic photovoltaic (OPV) samples were prepared on PEDOT:PSS covered Si wafers in a similar manner to the OPV devices. The SANS experiment was performed using the general purpose SANS instrument of the High Flux Isotope Reactor at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Deuterated chlorobenzene was used as the solvent.
