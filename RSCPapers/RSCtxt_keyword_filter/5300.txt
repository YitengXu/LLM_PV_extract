FeS2 nanorods show better catalytic properties than the FeS2 film and the Pt film due to their active facets, which helps to achieve a high short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of DSSCs. On the other hand, FeS2 nanorods have lower interface resistance than FeS2 thin films, which contributes to a higher fill factor (FF) of DSSCs. As a result, the solar cell with a CE of FeS2 nanorods exhibits an excellent power conversion efficiency, which is comparable to that of traditional DSSCs with a Pt CE.IntroductionDye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), which are promising alternatives for traditional silicon solar cells, have attracted tremendous attention in recent years, owing to their economical cost, simple process, and outstanding efficiency.1–6 Typical DSSCs possess an indispensable sandwich structure consisting of a photoanode, an electrolyte and a counter electrode (CE), and the three components jointly determine the final performance of DSSCs. So far, extensive studies and many progress have been made on photoanodes, namely dyes7,8 and electrodes.9–12 As for CEs, the Pt electrode has been demonstrated to be the most successful candidate with superior catalytic performance and stability.13,14 However, the high cost limits its practical applications.Great efforts have been made to exploit new materials and structures for CEs. The promising materials include carbonaceous materials (graphene,15,16 carbon nanofibers,17,18 active carbon,19 and carbon nanotubes20–22), conductive polymers,23,24 transition metal compounds (nitrides,25 carbides,26,27 oxides,28 sulphides29,30 and selenides31,32), and multiple-component compounds.33,34 These materials have been produced with various nanostructures, e.g., nanowires,35,36 nanofibers,37 nanotubes,38 nanosheets39 and nanograss.40 Nevertheless, the overall performance of the above CEs did not exceed that of the traditional Pt electrode. Therefore, developing an excellent CE for DSSCs is still a big challenge.Iron pyrite (FeS2) is considered as a potential material for photovoltaic application owing to its narrow band gap (0.95 eV), efficient optical absorption, non-toxicity and, most importantly, low cost.41–45 FeS2 nanoparticles have already been applied in some photovoltaic devices, such as thin film solar cells46,47 and heterojunction photodiodes, to enhance photocurrent and light response.48 Noticeably, Hu et al. investigated the possibility of applying FeS2 nanosheets as the CE in DSSCs, however, they did not get positive results due to the n-type characteristic of the obtained nanostructures.49 Hitherto, iron pyrite has been rarely utilized in DSSCs, and never showed good performance.Intrinsically, FeS2 possesses rather good catalytic activity,50–52 which can be further enhanced by generating a large specific surface area.53,54 Moreover, by carefully designing nanostructures, such as single crystal nanorods, the carrier transport property of the FeS2 material can be improved.55,56 Based on the above considerations, we propose that one-dimensional FeS2 nanostructures can work as a commendable CE in DSSCs. In the present work, we explore an efficient approach to synthesize FeS2 nanorod arrays on a fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate, and then demonstrate excellent performance of this nanostructure as the CE for DSSCs.ExperimentalSynthesis of FeS2 NRs and FeS2 film structuresFeO(OH) nanorod arrays were grown on FTO glass via a hydrothermal route. Firstly, 0.704 g sodium oxalate was dissolved in 20 ml distilled water to prepare 0.15 M solution, and 1.605 g iron vitriol was dissolved in 15 ml distilled water for obtaining 0.165 M solution. Then the sodium oxalate solution and iron vitriol solution were mixed under magnetic stirring for about 5 min. Afterwards, the solution was filled into a 30 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave to its 80% capacity, and then a piece of FTO glass was put into the autoclave with the conductive side downward. The reaction system was kept at 100 °C for 5 or 10 h, and then the FTO glass with the product was taken out, immersed in the aqueous solution of 30% ethanol for 24 h, and dried in a vacuum oven at 25 °C for 30 min.FeO(OH) nanorod arrays were sulfurized in a tubular furnace to fabricate FeS2 nanorod arrays. The FTO substrate with FeO(OH) nanorod arrays and sulfur powder were placed in a graphite boat, which was placed at the end of the tube, then the tube was evacuated to 1 kPa and heated to 500 °C. Subsequently, the graphite boat was pushed into the center of the furnace, maintained at 500 °C for 60 min, and cooled down under vacuum to room temperature.FeS2 films were prepared via thermal sulfurization of Fe films obtained by magnetron sputtering using an Leica EM SCD500 apparatus, as reported in the literature.57 The pressure in the sputtering chamber was maintained at 0.5 × 10−2 mbar during the sputtering process, and the thickness of Fe films was controlled as 100, 200, and 400 nm by adjusting the sputtering time. The sulfurization process is the same as that used for FeS2 nanorod arrays.Cell assemblyThe photoanodes of DSSCs were prepared by screen printing commercial P-25 TiO2 nanoparitcles on FTO substrates, annealing at 500 °C, and soaking in N719 dye solution overnight. The photoanode with an effective area of 0.23 cm2 and the CE were separated by a hot-melt Surlyn film and sealed through hot-pressing. The redox electrolyte (consisting of 0.5 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.3 M tertbutylpyridine, and 0.3 M tetrabutylammonium iodide in acetonitrile) was injected into the interspace between the photoanode and the CE from the CE side through a predrilled hole.CharacterizationThe morphology of CEs was observed using a Hitachi S-4800 SEM with an EDS module and an FEI TechnainG2 F20 TEM with a field-emission gun operating at 200 kV. XRD analysis for the crystal structure of the products was carried out on a Bluke D8 advance. UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence spectra were recorded on a Hitachi UV4100 absorption spectrophotometer and a Hitachi 4500 photoluminescence spectrophotometer, respectively. Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves were recorded using a Keithley 2611 digital multimeter. The light source was a 150 W xenon lamp (Sciencetech, SS150) calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 with a standard Si solar cell. And the IPCE was measured using a CROWNTECH Q Test Station 1000D. EIS and CV measurements were carried out at a constant temperature of 20 °C under dark conditions, using a Princeton Versa Stat3 electrochemistry workstation over a frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz at a 0.1 V bias voltage. The cell consists of two identical thermally decomposed Pt/FTO or FeS2/FTO electrodes and the electrolyte inside.Results and discussionFeS2 nanorod arrays were fabricated on FTO substrates via a two-step process (see Experimental section). The first step involves a hydrothermal reaction, in which the FeOOH nanorods were obtained via the reactions reported in the literature.55,56 FeSO4 + Na2C2O4 = FeC2O4 + Na2SO4(1) FeC2O4 ↔ Fe2+ + C2O42−(2) 2Fe2+ + O2 + 4H+ = 2Fe3+ + 2H2O(3) Fe3+ + 3OH− = Fe(OH)3(4) Fe(OH)3 = FeOOH + H2O(5)The morphology of the product by 10 h hydrothermal reaction is shown in Fig. 1. The top-view scanning electron microscope (SEM) image illustrates that the as-prepared nanorod arrays grow densely on the FTO substrate (Fig. 1a), and the side-view SEM image suggests that the nanorods grow vertically with a length and diameter of about 600 and 20 nm, respectively (Fig. 1b). By reducing the hydrothermal reaction time to 5 h, shorter FeOOH nanorods can be produced with a length of about 300 nm (Fig. S1†). The phase constitution of the nanorods was identified as pure FeOOH (JVPDS no. 29-0713) according to the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern shown in Fig. S2.† The internal structure of the FeOOH nanorods was further characterized by a transmission electron microscope (TEM), as depicted in Fig. 1c and d. The diffraction contrast in Fig. 1c and clear lattice fringes in Fig. 1d indicate a single crystal feature of the nanorods. Fig. 1  The characterizations of FeOOH nanorod arrays. (a) Top view and (b) cross-sectional SEM images. (c) TEM and (d) HRTEM images. The interplanar spacings of 0.418 nm in (d) are in accord with the theoretical value of (110) planes of FeOOH. In the second step, the FeOOH nanorod arrays were sulfurized at a high temperature (500 °C) for production of FeS2 nanorod arrays. The reaction is similar to ion exchange55,56 2FeOOH + 7S = 2FeS2 + H2S + 2SO2.(6)The morphology of FeOOH nanorods (Fig. 2) was maintained steadily after the sulfurization, keeping their length and diameter constant (Fig. 2a–d). The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) result (Fig. 2e) demonstrates the presence of Fe and S elements with atomic ratios close to the stoichiometry of FeS2. XRD patterns in Fig. 2f and S2† illustrate the formation of pure FeS2 nanorods, because all of the peaks belong to FeS2 (JVPDS no. 42-1340), and no other peaks were found from by-products, such as Fe7S8 and marcasite-FeS2. The strong (002) diffraction peak indicates that nanorods grow along the [002] direction, which is confirmed by the HRTEM image (Fig. 2d), where (002) planes of FeS2 can be observed perpendicular to the growth direction, while (200) planes along the side wall. In contrast, the FeS2 film is composed of nanoparticles with random orientation, which was demonstrated by HRTEM images (Fig. S3b–d†) and the XRD pattern (Fig. S3f†). Moreover, the obtained FeS2 nanorods exhibited a characteristic of a quasi p-type semiconductor in the Hall effect measurement shown in Fig. S4.† Their band gap was estimated to be 0.94 eV by extrapolating the hν − (αhν)1/2 plot (see Fig. S5b†), which is close to the theoretical value (∼0.95 eV), and photoluminescence spectra show a near band-edge emission (see Fig. S6†).

The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement on symmetric cells has been proved as a reliable technique for assessing the performance of CEs.58–61 To construct a symmetric cell, two FTO substrates with FeS2 nanorod arrays were separated by a hot-melt Surlyn film and sealed through hot-pressing, and then the electrolyte was injected into the interspace. The process is the same as that used for a common solar cell, and the final structure is shown in Fig. 3a. For comparison, three kinds of thin films composed of FeS2 nanoparticles were prepared on FTO conductive glass with thicknesses of 100, 200 and 400 nm, respectively (Fig. S7†), and they were assembled into symmetric cells as well. Fig. 3b shows the CV curves of the symmetric cells with different electrodes. The limiting current of 600 nm FeS2 nanorod arrays is higher than that of 300 nm nanorod arrays (Fig. 3b), which indicates that longer FeS2 nanorods have better catalytic properties. In contrast, the 200 nm FeS2 film shows a higher catalytic activity than thinner or thicker FeS2 films (Fig. S8†), suggesting that the optimum thickness for thin films is around 200 nm. In particular, the limiting current of 600 nm FeS2 nanorod arrays is superior to that of FeS2 thin films and even higher than that of the conventional Pt CE (Fig. 3b), indicating excellent catalytic activity of FeS2 nanorod arrays. Besides, the limiting current of FeS2 nanorod arrays decreased less than 20% even after being soaked in an iodide electrolyte for 10 days according to the time-resolved CV curves shown in Fig. S9a,† and the morphology of FeS2 nanorods maintained steadily (see Fig. S9c†). The above results indicate that FeS2 nanorods are rather stable in the iodide electrolyte. Fig. 3  CV and EIS measurements on various CEs. (a) Schematic structure of dummy cells for CV and EIS measurements. (b) CV curves of the Pt film, FeS2 film, and FeS2 nanorod arrays. (c) Nyquist plots of the Pt film, FeS2 film, and FeS2 nanorod arrays. The lines express good results for corresponding EIS data, and the inset shows the equivalent circuit. An electrochemical impedance spectrometer (EIS) was employed to investigate the internal resistances of FeS2 CEs. The measurements were performed on the symmetric cells constructed with two identical electrodes (see Experimental section). The Nyquist plots for different cells with optimum CE thicknesses are shown in Fig. 3c, and the equivalent circuit is presented in the inset of Fig. 3c. All of the curves are composed of two arcs; the left arc (in the high frequency region) reflects the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the CE/electrolyte interface, while the right one reflects the Nernst diffusion impedance (W). Moreover, the onset of the first arc indicates the ohmic series resistance (Rs) of the device.59 By fitting the impedance spectra using the Z-view software, Rct and Rs values can be determined for each CE, and the results are listed in Table 1. Among three CEs, the Pt film possesses the lowest series and interface resistance, FeS2 nanorod arrays exhibit similar series and interface resistances with the Pt film. However, the interface resistance of the FeS2 film is about 20 times higher than that of FeS2 nanorod arrays, although its series resistance is similar to the Pt film and FeS2 nanorod arrays. The low series resistance of both the FeS2 porous film and nanorod arrays indicates that the FeS2 material has excellent carrier transfer properties, while the remarkably different interface resistances of the FeS2 porous film and nanorod arrays suggest that the FeS2 morphology and structure can have a significant impact on the electron transfer through interface.

Taking the Pt film as a reference, the FeS2 thin film presents a worse performance, whereas FeS2 nanorod arrays show a similar performance, and its short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) is even higher than that of the Pt film. The incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) results of Pt-based cells and FeS2-based cells are shown in Fig. 4b. The DSSCs with different CEs show similar plots, indicating that the CE materials do not have remarkable wavelength dependence on the device performance. Fig. 4  Photo-electrical conversion properties of DSSCs with different CEs. (a) Photocurrent density–voltage and (b) IPCE characteristics measured at AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). Below, we discuss the influence of FeS2 nanostructures on their properties and the final performance of DSSCs. Three possible reasons can be responsible for the high performance of FeS2 nanorod arrays. First, the regular surface of FeS2 nanorods can provide many active sites for catalytic reactions. In principle, the prerequisite for catalytic reactions is the adsorption of reagents on catalysts.60–64 Commonly, metal catalysts connect with reagents through d-orbital electrons,61 and semiconductor catalysts through charge-transfer chemisorption,62–64 specifically, acceptor-like species (such as I2 and I3−) adsorb at cation (Fe2+) sites of an ionic semiconductor.64 Therefore, the catalytic performance of a semiconductor catalyst is sensitive to its surface structure. As shown in Fig. 2d, the FeS2 nanorods grow along the [002] direction, thus their surface is enclosed with {200} or {220} planes. Those regular facets are significantly different from the disordered surface of nanoparticles in a porous film, and can provide many active sites for catalytic reactions. Second, p-type FeS2 nanorods could form an Ohmic contact with the electrolyte, which facilitates the charge transfer from the oxidized species (I2 and I3−) to CEs, thus accelerating the regeneration of oxidized redox couples.49 Third, as shown in the XRD pattern and the HRTEM image, FeS2 nanorods exhibit a highly crystalline structure, which hardly contains grain boundaries and defects, thus they can provide a direct pathway for carrier transport. All the above factors may improve the catalytic activity together; hence, FeS2 nanorod arrays exhibit better catalytic properties than the Pt CE.In contrast, the FeS2 thin film consists of many nanoparticles with irregular surface, and the electrons or holes must move through many interfaces before they can meet and recombine each other, thus the catalytic efficiency is obviously depressed. As a result, the FeS2 film CE shows a worse catalytic performance.It has been well proven that the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of the DSSCs, depending on the electron collection efficiency, is determined by the catalytic performance of the CE,65,66 while the fill factor (FF) of the DSSCs varies inversely with the series and interface resistances of the CE.56 Since the FeS2 nanorods have the best catalytic properties, it is not surprising that the DSSCs with a CE of FeS2 nanorod arrays display the highest short-circuit photocurrent density. On the other hand, the FeS2 nanorods have lower interface resistance than FeS2 thin films, therefore, the DSSCs with a FeS2 nanorod CE exhibit a higher fill factor than that with a CE of the FeS2 thin film. The higher Jsc and FF of FeS2 nanorod arrays combine to achieve excellent power conversion efficiency, which is comparable to the Pt film. However, FeS2 electrodes show higher Rs and Rct than the Pt electrode due to their low carrier concentration, which results in higher internal voltage drop than that of the Pt film. Therefore the Voc of FeS2-based cells is slightly lower than that of Pt-based cells.ConclusionsPyrite nanorod arrays were fabricated on the fluorine doped tin oxide substrate by sulfurizing the FeOOH nanorod arrays and employed directly as the counter electrode for DSSCs. The FeS2 nanorod arrays show better catalytic properties than the FeS2 film and even the Pt film, and DSSCs with FeS2 nanorod arrays display a higher short-circuit photocurrent density and a power conversion efficiency comparable to that with the Pt electrode. We believe that the performance of FeS2 nanorod arrays can be further improved by decreasing their electric resistance through post-treatments, such as doping or cladding, and our work paves the way for the application of pyrite in the field of solar cells.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 51171127, 51102176, 51271129 and 11272229), Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City (no. 11ZCKFGX01300, 11JCYBJC02000 and 09JCZDJC22600) and Seed Foundation of Tianjin University.Notes and referencesM.
