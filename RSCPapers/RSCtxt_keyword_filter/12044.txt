    , Accepted 18th July 2014First published on 21st July 2014AbstractFour novel D–π–A metal-free organic dyes DTP1–4 containing a dithienopyrrolobenzothiadiazole (DTPBT) unit were synthesized and applied in dye-sensitized solar cells, where DTPBT was employed as a π-spacer for the first time. The photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of the dyes were systematically investigated. The dyes DTP1–4 showed broad absorption spectra and high molar extinction coefficient, resulting in high light harvesting efficiency. In addition, the impacts of donors and the thiophene unit as an additional π-spacer were also studied. The results showed that the dye DTP4 with triphenylamine as the donor exhibited better photovoltaic performance than DTP1–3 with phenothiazine as the donor. The linking position of the thiophene unit to the DTPBT unit significantly influenced the photovoltaic performance. A power conversion efficiency of 7.55% with 1 mM CDCA as the co-adsorbent under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination was reached by the DSSC sensitized by the dye DTP4. These results indicate that the DTPBT-based organic dye is a promising candidate for efficient DSSCs.
Introduction
In recent years, enormous attention has been paid to the research of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).1,2 As we all know, the sensitizer, as one of the key components of DSSCs, plays a pivotal role in achieving higher power conversion efficiency. It plays a critical function in light harvesting and electron injection. To date, DSSCs incorporating ruthenium based sensitizers and zinc–porphyrin based co-sensitizers have reached high efficiency over 11%3,4 and 12%,5,6 respectively.
Metal-free organic dyes have gained a great deal of attention for their unique advantages, such as facile fabrication procedure, high molar extinction coefficients as well as environmental friendliness.7–10 Overall conversion efficiency of up to 10% has been achieved from liquid DSSCs by employing pure organic dyes.11,12 The donor–π-conjugation–acceptor (D–π–A) configuration of the organic dyes is the most researched architecture, owing to its efficient intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) properties. In the past decades, many efforts have focused on the electron donor units like triphenylamine, carbazole, phenothiazine, and indoline.13–20 At the same time, many groups have explored various π-bridges in the D–π–A dyes, such as thiophene, furan, benzene and pyrrole.21–27 Moreover, some electron-withdrawing groups acting as auxiliary acceptors have been introduced into DSSCs to tune the energy level, broaden the absorption spectra and improve the stability of the device.28–34
The π-bridge plays an important role in organic dyes. It links the donor and the acceptor, adjusts the HOMO–LUMO levels and extends the absorption range.2 Since the π-bridge is the passageway which can facilitate the electron migration from the donor to the acceptor, its geometry should be relatively planar rather than distorted. Recently, Cheng et al. synthesized a novel nitrogen-bridged donor–acceptor multifused dithienopyrrolobenzothiadiazole (DTPBT) by intramolecular Cadogan annulation,35 and used it as a monomer to prepare a copolymer which was successfully applied in polymer solar cells.36 DTPBT shows good coplanarity and a donor–acceptor–donor structure, which might be expected to be a good π-spacer in the organic dye. Moreover, the large planar structure of DTPBT might be beneficial to enhance the molar extinction coefficient of the dyes, which can increase the light-harvesting ability of the DSSCs. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report about DTPBT-based organic dyes for DSSCs.
In this paper, we designed and synthesized four novel D–π–A metal-free organic dyes DTP1–4 with the DTPBT unit as a π-spacer (Fig. 1). In order to study the impacts of donors and additional π-spacer, phenothiazine and triphenylamine were introduced as the electron-donor, and the thiophene unit was linked to cyanoacrylic acid and the N-octyl-phenothiazine unit, respectively. In addition, two alkyl chains were incorporated at the N-position of the DTPBT unit, which not only might improve the solubility of the dye, but also reduce the intermolecular aggregation and suppress the charge recombination at the TiO2 interface.37,38 The photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of the four dyes were systematically investigated.

Results and discussion
Synthesis of the materials
The synthesis route of the dyes DTP1–4 is depicted in Scheme 1. 3-Bromo-10-octyl-10H-phenothiazine (PTZ-C8Br)39 and DTPBT35 were synthesized according to the references. N-Alkylation of DTPBT gave compound 2. The aldehyde 3 was prepared from 2 by the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction and then converted to 4 through bromination with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS). The aldehydes 5, 9, 12 and 13 were synthesized by the Suzuki–Miyaura reaction. The Knoevenagel condensation reactions of 5 and 13 with tert-butyl 2-cyanoacetate afforded their cyanoacetates, respectively. The cyanoacetates were hydrolysed with trifluoroacetic acid to give the target products DTP1 and DTP4, respectively. DTP2 was prepared from 2 through one bromination reaction, two Suzuki coupling reactions, a Knoevenagel condensation and a hydrolysis reaction. DTP3 with one thiophene unit between phenothiazine and DTPBT was prepared in a similar manner from 9. All the new compounds were verified by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and HRMS.

In order to determine the E/Z geometry of the double bonds in the products of the Knoevenagel condensation reactions, we used the J-HMBC method to determine the geometry of the double bond of the intermediate 14 as a model.40,41 The J-HMBC measurement showed that the olefinic proton has a vicinal coupling constant (3JCH) of 5.5 Hz to the carbonyl carbon, which means that the olefinic proton and the carboxy group are a cis configuration (see ESI†). Therefore, the trisubstituted double bond of 14 is E-configuration.
Photophysical properties
The UV-Vis absorption and emission spectra of DTP1–4 in CH2Cl2/MeOH (1:1) solution (2 × 10−5 M) are shown in Fig. 2 and the corresponding photophysical data are listed in Table 1. In the UV-Vis spectra of the dyes in solution, the four dyes exhibit two distinct bands in the range of 300–400 nm and 500–550 nm, respectively. The maximum absorption wavelengths of DTP1, DTP2, DTP3 and DTP4 are 507 (molar extinction coefficient (ε) = 47520 M−1 cm−1), 519 (ε = 45765 M−1 cm−1), 512 (ε = 61680 M−1 cm−1) and 505 nm (ε = 42425 M−1 cm−1), respectively. In comparison with DTP1, the λmax of DTP2 and DTP3 displays a red-shift of 12 and 5 nm, respectively. This phenomenon can be ascribed to the inserted thiophene extending the π-conjugation system, which enhances the extent of electron delocalization over the whole molecule. It is worth noting that the four dyes exhibit high molar extinction coefficients from 4.2 × 104 to 6.2 × 104 M−1 cm−1, which indicates that the four organic dyes have good light-harvesting ability. Additionally, the high values of ε may be attributed from the incorporation of the large planar structure of DTPBT.42–44

The absorption spectra of DTP1–4 on 16 μm thick TiO2 films are shown in Fig. 3a. Upon adsorption to the TiO2 films, a broadening spectrum can be found for four dyes compared with the spectrum in the solution, which is beneficial to light-harvesting and Jsc enhancement. In addition, the absorption peaks of DTP1–4 are observed to blue-shift by about 7, 25, 36 and 3 nm with respect to those in the solution, respectively. Such a hypsochromic shift on the TiO2 films can be mainly attributed to deprotonation of the carboxylic acid and H-type of aggregation.19 Obviously, the absorption bands of DTP2 (25 nm) and DTP3 (36 nm) adsorbed on TiO2 films display larger blue-shifts compared with DTP1 (7 nm) and DTP4 (3 nm), which indicates that the two dyes with one thiophene inserted in the π-spacer have a higher degree of π-stacked aggregation on the TiO2 films.45 As we all know, chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) can work as an anti-aggregation compound in the DSSC device. Thus, as shown in Fig. 3b, after adding CDCA as the co-adsorbent on the TiO2 films, the four dyes present a red-shift of absorption spectra compared with those without CDCA on the TiO2. The concentration dependent absorption spectra of the four dyes in the solution were recorded (Fig. S1†). When the concentration of the four dyes increased from 5 × 10−7 M to 5 × 10−5 M, bathochromic shifts of the maximum absorption wavelengths were observed, which was due to the aggregation of the organic molecules.46

Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out to investigate the possibility of electron transfer from the sensitizer molecule to TiO2 and the regeneration of the sensitizer (Fig. 4, Table 1). The estimated ground state oxidation potentials corresponding to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of DTP1–4, calculated from the equation EHOMO = −(Eox(dye) − Eox(Fc/Fc+) + 4.80) eV, are −5.06, −5.05, −5.05 and −5.19 eV, respectively. It is clear that a larger gap between the HOMO level of triphenylamine based dye DTP4 and the I−/I3− redox couple (−4.6 eV vs. vacuum)29 than phenothiazine based dyes DTP1–3 implies that the oxidized DTP4 can be more effectively regenerated. The energy gap E0–0 between the HOMO level and the LUMO level (2.24 eV, 2.18 eV, 2.22 eV and 2.23 eV for DTP1, DTP2, DTP3 and DTP4) were calculated from the intersection points of normalized UV-Vis absorption and emission spectra of the sensitizers. DTP2 exhibits the lowest HOMO–LUMO energy gap among the dyes, which, in turn, corresponds well with the red shift of the absorption spectrum. It can be confirmed by the UV-Vis absorption spectrum.47,48 The lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO), calculated from HOMO + E0–0, are, −2.82, −2.87, −2.83 and −2.96 eV for DTP1, DTP2, DTP3 and DTP4, respectively. Compared with DTP1, when the donor is changed from phenothiazine to triphenylamine, DTP4 exhibits a more negative value of HOMO, which may be due to the stronger electron-donating ability of phenothiazine than that of triphenylamine. Similar results were discovered in several pioneering studies.49,50 The LUMO levels of these dyes are much more positive than the titania conduction band edge (−4.0 eV vs. vacuum),51 which implies that the electron injection from the excited dyes into TiO2 is energetically permitted.

Molecular orbital calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G* level with the Gaussian 03W program package were carried out to further understand the geometrical configuration and electron distributions of the four sensitizers (Table 2). According to the optimized structures, the electron distributions in the HOMO levels of the four dyes mainly concentrate on the electron donor and extend to the π-spacer, while predominantly locate on the cyanoacetic acid segment and partly on the DTBPT unit in the LUMO levels. These kinds of electron distributions facilitate electron injection from the dyes to the TiO2 surface. In the optimized structures of the four dyes, the DTPBT unit exhibits almost a planar construction. The dihedral angles between DTBPT and phenothiazine or triphenylamine are 24.52° for DTP1, 24.38° for DTP2 and 25.06° for DTP4, respectively. The torsional angles between DTBPT and thiophene are 2.78° and 9.07° for DTP2 and DTP3, respectively. The torsional degree of the entire DTP2 molecule is less than that of DTP3. The result is consistent with the UV-Vis absorption spectra in the solution. Compared with DTP3, DTP2 generates a 7 nm red-shift of the CT band. Based on the calculations, we can find that the four dyes exhibit well coplanar geometries, leading to effective π-conjugation throughout the molecules. This can facilitate the charge transfer, while increasing the likelihood of dye aggregation and electron recombination.52

Time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations were carried out to understand the electronic transition assignments and excitation energies, and the data are collected in Table S1.† Taking DTP1 as an example, two distinct bands in the absorption spectra are produced from several kinds of electron excitation. The low energy band located at 507 nm is ascribed to HOMO → LUMO (77.7%) and HOMO − 1 → LUMO (15.8%) transitions. The other band in the range of 350–400 nm is composed of HOMO − 1 → LUMO (9.8%), HOMO − 1 → LUMO + 1 (16.9%) and HOMO → LUMO + 1 (66.7%). From the view of the data, the maximum absorptions of DTP1–4 mainly come from the transition from HOMO to LUMO and partially from HOMO − 1 → LUMO. In addition, the values of the simulated λmax of the four dyes are similar to the experimental data, which show the accuracy of this theoretical calculation.
Adsorption amount
The dye loading amounts of the dyes on the TiO2 surface (16 μm) were obtained by desorbing the dyes from the films by dipping them into an aqueous solution of NaOH and THF (1:1) for 30 min and measuring the absorbance of the desorbed dye solutions (Table 3).53 The dye loading amounts of DTP1, DTP2, DTP3 and DTP4 are 3.65 × 10−7, 4.46 × 10−7, 3.43 × 10−7 and 4.45 × 10−7 mol cm−2, respectively. DTP2 and DTP4 with higher loading amounts than DTP1 and DTP3 exhibit stronger UV-Vis absorption on the TiO2 films. The adsorption amounts of DTP1 and DTP3 are lower than that of DTP4 because the N-octyl-phenothiazine and N-octyl-phenothiazine-thiophene units have larger molecular configuration than triphenylamine. Although DTP1 and DTP3 have a similar structure to DTP2, their loading amounts are lower because a large configuration moiety near the acceptor decreases adsorption.54

Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs
The photoresponse properties of the device sensitized by DTP1–4 were evaluated by incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra, as shown in Fig. 5. All the four dyes exhibit a broad spectral response range from 400 to 750 nm, indicating that all the dyes can efficiently convert the visible light into photocurrent. The broad spectral ranges are well agreed with the UV-Vis absorption on TiO2 films (Fig. 3a). The IPCE value of DTP4 is over 70% from 430 to 630 nm with a maximum IPCE value of 78% at 470 nm, which shows a higher IPCE value than the other three dyes. This result is also in good accordance with the Jsc variation obtained in J–V (current–voltage) measurements. On the other hand, DTP1, DTP2 and DTP3 get maximum IPCE values of 68% at 480 nm, 49% at 490 nm and 60% at 490 nm, respectively. From the absorption spectra (Fig. 2), DTP2 and DTP3 show a good light harvesting ability but lower IPCE values compared to DTP1 and DTP4. IPCE is a product of the electron injection efficiency, light-harvesting efficiency and charge collection efficiency. For a dye-loaded film with the thickness over 10 μm, light harvesting efficiency can be considered to be 100%.46 Therefore, in comparison with DTP1 and DTP4, the thiophene unit of DTP2 and DTP3 caused the significant decrease of IPCE values due to more serious intermolecular aggregation, leading to lower charge injection efficiency.42 On the basis of aforementioned photo-physical properties' analysis, DTP2 and DTP3 adsorbed on TiO2 show larger blue-shift appearance than DTP1 and DTP4 by comparison of λmax of four dyes in the solution.
 Fig. 5  IPCE spectra of the DSSCs based on DTP1–4. 
The detailed photovoltaic parameters of short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc), open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and overall conversion efficiency (η) are displayed in Fig. 6 and summarized in Table 3. The device sensitized by DTP4 shows the best efficiency of 6.86% with a Jsc of 15.30 mA cm−2, a Voc of 726 mV and an FF of 0.62. The other three cells based on dyes DTP1, DTP2 and DTP3 exhibit efficiencies of 5.02%, 3.54% and 4.39%, respectively. In particular, the DSSC based on DTP4 presents the highest η due to its highest Jsc and Voc. The higher Jsc of DTP4 can be ascribed to the higher dye loading capacity, less intermolecular aggregation and more efficient regeneration of the oxidized dye. This result is in good agreement with the IPCE spectra. The highest Voc value of DTP4 can be explained by the fact that the triphenylamine unit has a similar structure to the propeller which is better to restrain aggregation and retard charge recombination. Besides, faster regeneration of the oxidized DTP4 molecule than the other three dyes will suppress the back electron transfer from the TiO2 to the oxidized dye. DTP4 with triphenylamine as the donor shows better cell performance than DTP1 with N-octyl-phenothiazine. The reason is that DTP4 has a larger dye loading amount, and a higher value of the HOMO level which ensures efficient regeneration of the oxidized dye. The DSSCs based on DTP2 displays a relatively poor performance with the lowest values of Jsc and Voc, which may be ascribed to increase of dark current and aggregation. In comparison with the three dyes DTP1, DTP2 and DTP3, it is easy to find that when a thiophene ring is inserted, no matter whether it is near the acceptor or close to the donor, the overall conversion efficiency is dropped, due to more intermolecular aggregation. Furthermore, this aggregation has a deleterious effect on electron transfer from the donor to TiO2.55,56 In addition, there have been many examples illustrating that dyes with sulfur-containing thiophene units have a stronger interaction with I3−, leading to more facile charge recombination and lower Voc.57 From another perspective, this result suggests that DTPBT is already an efficient π-bridge, and it is no longer necessary to extend the conjugation system by increasing the π-bridge length.
 Fig. 6  
J–V curves of the DSSCs based on DTP1–4. 
Due to strong intermolecular interactions, π–π stacking of organic dyes always occurs, causing inefficient electron injection and low power conversion efficiency.58 It has been verified that CDCA (chenodeoxycholic acid) can prevent the aggregation of dyes, and then improve the performance of the solar cells.59 Therefore, the performances of the DSSCs in the presence of the co-adsorbent CDCA are studied (Fig. 7, Table 4). After addition of CDCA, the short-circuit photocurrents and power conversion efficiencies of DTP1–4 were improved significantly. The apparent enhancement of the DSSC performances is attributed to the hampering of the dye aggregation, improving the electron injection efficiency. Suppression of dye aggregation was also supported by the red shift of the absorption spectra of the four dyes on the TiO2 films when CDCA was added (Fig. 3). As shown in Table 4, a power conversion efficiency of 7.55% (Jsc = 16.95 mA cm−2, Voc = 694 mV, FF = 0.64) for DTP4 was obtained with 1 mM CDCA as the co-adsorbent.

To further understand the relationship between the charge transfer process and photovoltaic properties of the DSSCs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out in the dark. The Nyquist plots for the DSSCs based on DTP1–4 are displayed in Fig. 8, and the corresponding data are listed in Table 5. The first semicircle (Rce) is attributed to charge transfer at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface, while the second semicircle (Rrec) is accorded to charge transfer at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.60 Similar Rce values are obtained in the low frequency region (6.888 Ω cm−2 for DTP1, 5.181 Ω cm−2 for DTP2, 5.189 Ω cm−2 for DTP3 and 5.611 Ω cm−2 for DTP4) by using the same counter electrode and electrolyte. On the other hand, the diverse dyes adsorbed on the TiO2 films cause the difference of Rrec. Obviously, the values of the large semicircles decrease in the order of DTP4 (409.7 Ω cm−2) > DTP1 (330.0 Ω cm−2) > DTP3 (160.4 Ω cm−2) > DTP2 (128.9 Ω cm−2). It is known to all, a smaller Rrec indicates a faster charge recombination and a larger dark current.61 Hence, the largest Rrec observed in DTP4 sensitized cells indicates that DTP4 possesses more effective suppression of the recombination of the injected electron with I−/I3− in the electrolyte. The electron lifetimes calculated by fitting the equation τr = Rrec × CPE2 (CPE2, chemical capacitance)62 are 280.1, 105.1, 151.4 and 310.1 ms for DTP1, DTP2, DTP3 and DTP4, respectively. The trend of electron lifetimes is in the order of DTP4 > DTP1 > DTP3 > DTP2, which is well in accordance with the Voc values obtained in J–V curves. The EIS results show that the thiophene unit may interact with the redox, which drives I3− to approach the TiO2 surface and facilitates the electron recombination. Moreover, the longer electron lifetime of DTP4 compared to the other three phenothiazine based dyes is associated with the more effective suppression of the back reaction of the injected electron with I3− in the electrolyte, leading to a higher Voc.

Conclusions
In summary, we explored four novel metal-free organic dyes DTP1–4 with a DTPBT unit as a π-spacer. The dyes exhibit broad photo-spectral response and high molar extinction coefficients (4.2–6.2 × 104 M−1 cm−1), resulting in good solar cell performance. Triphenylamine as the electron-donor brings better photovoltaic performance compared with phenothiazine. DTPBT is already an efficient π-bridge by itself, and it is no longer necessary to extend the conjugation system of the dye by increasing the π-bridge length. Introduction of the thiophene unit to extend the π-bridge conjugation leads to serious intermolecular aggregation and decreases the electron lifetime. The DTPBT-based dyes have well coplanar geometry and exhibit effective electron separation from HOMO levels to LUMO levels, which is confirmed by DFT and TDDFT calculations. Under standard global AM 1.5 G solar light illumination conditions, the DSSC sensitized by DTP4 yielded the highest conversion efficiency of 6.86%, and achieved an efficiency of 7.55% with 1 mM CDCA as the co-adsorbent. The results indicate that the DTPBT-based organic dyes are promising candidates for efficient DSSCs.
Experiments
Materials and instruments
All reagents were purchased from Aladdin, Adamas and J&K. THF and dioxane were distilled over sodium under an argon atmosphere; other solvents of reagent-grade were dried over a 4 Å molecular sieve. All reactions were performed under argon and monitored by TLC. The silica gel (200–300 or 300–400 mesh) was used in the column chromatography. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 400 MHz instrument with the solvents CDCl3, DMSO-d6 and THF-d8. The melting point was measured on a SGW X-4B microscopic melting point apparatus. The absorption and emission spectra of organic dyes in CH2Cl2/methanol (v/v = 1:1) solution (2 × 10−5 M) were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer and a Fluorolog III photoluminescence spectrometer, respectively. The absorption spectra of dyes adsorbed on TiO2 were recorded on a UV-3010 spectrophotometer. The dye loading amounts were conducted by desorbing the dyes from TiO2 films with 0.1 M NaOH in THF/H2O (1:1) and recording the UV-Vis spectrum. Electrochemical redox potentials were obtained by cyclic voltammetry (CV), using three electrode cells on an electrochemistry workstation (e-corder (ED 401) potentiostat). The dye adsorbed TiO2 films were used as working electrodes, the Ag/AgCl (3 M in KCl) as a reference electrode and a platinum wire as the counter electrode. The supporting electrolyte was 0.1 M TBAPF6 in MeCN. The ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple (4.80 eV vs. vacuum) acted as the standard. The photocurrent–photovoltage characteristics were performed on a Keithley 2400 source meter under simulated AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) illumination with a solar light simulator (Oriel, Model: 91192). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were recorded on a Spectral Products DK240 monochromator from the 400 to 800 nm region. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded on a Zahner Zennium electrochemical workstation under the dark conditions.

Fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells
The fabrication of the dye-sensitized solar cells was carried out according to the previously reported procedures.56,63 Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glasses were washed with detergent, water, ethanol and acetone in an ultrasonic bath to remove dirt and debris. Anatase TiO2 nanoparticles (20 nm) were prepared through a hydrothermal treatment with a precursor solution containing Ti(OBu)4 (10 mL), ethanol (20 mL), acetic acid (18 mL) and deionized water (50 mL). The TiO2 powder (1.0 g) was ground for 40 min in the mixture of ethanol (8.0 mL), acetic acid (0.2 mL), terpineol (3.0 g) and ethyl cellulose (0.5 g) to form a homogeneous slurry. Finally, the slurry was sonicated for 15 min in an ultrasonic bath to form a viscous white TiO2 paste. Then the TiO2 photoanodes (about 16 μm thickness) were prepared via the screen-printing process onto FTO glass. The prepared films were annealed through a procedure (325 °C for 5 min, 375 °C for 5 min, 450 °C for 15 min, and 500 °C for 15 min) to remove the organic substances. Then TiO2 films were soaked in 0.04 M TiCl4 aqueous solution for 30 min at 70 °C to improve the photocurrent and photovoltaic performance. The treated films were rinsed with deionized water, ethanol and then sintered again at 520 °C for 30 min. After cooling to 80 °C, the films were immersed in a 3.0 × 10−4 M solution of the dyes for 24 h (0.3 mM dye in CH2Cl2/MeOH (1:1)). For the co-adsorption, chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) was added into the dye solution at a concentration of 1 mM. Afterward these films were washed with CH2Cl2/MeOH (1:1) and dried. The dye-loaded TiO2/FTO glass films were assembled into a sandwiched type together with a Pt/FTO counter electrode. The active area of the dye-coated TiO2 film was 0.16 cm2.
