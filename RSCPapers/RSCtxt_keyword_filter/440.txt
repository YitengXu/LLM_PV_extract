    , Accepted 23rd June 2022First published on 2nd July 2022AbstractPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) have demonstrated remarkable progress, showing high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and low cost. However, there is still huge room for improvement in terms of long-term stability, repairability, and lead toxicity reduction before large-scale industrialization can start. Here, we propose an internal encapsulating layer (IEL) based on an in situ cross-linked insoluble polymer (Spiro-NPU) with matched energy levels, good electrical conductivity, and matched hole mobility. While the insertion of Spiro-NPU significantly enhanced the photovoltaic performance, with highest PCEs of 23.26% on a rigid substrate and about 20% for flexible devices, most importantly, the IEL strongly enhanced the moisture/thermal stability and repairability of the PSCs. No PCE decay was observed after 3000 h of aging in air at 60% relative humidity (RH); over 90% of the initial efficiency was maintained after 500 h of aging at 85% RH and 25 °C (or at 55% RH and 85 °C); and 97% of the initial PCE was retained after operating at the maximum power point (MPP) under 1 sun illumination (∼50 °C in N2) for 200 h without any external encapsulation. In addition, the photovoltaic-inactive hydrated phase of the perovskite film obtained after one month of aging (85% RH at 25 °C) can be recovered back into the photovoltaic-active black phase after annealing or irradiation at 1 sun, and the corresponding PSCs also show this repairability. Furthermore, our IEL exhibits lead blocking capabilities, paving the way to a promising strategy aimed at stable, efficient, and safe PSCs.

Broader context
Long-term stability is a critical problem preventing the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we propose an in situ cross-linked polymer (Spiro-NPU) as an internal encapsulating layer (IEL) with strong hydrophobicity. In this strategy, the Spiro-NPU IEL not only protects perovskite films against moisture-, heat-, and defect-induced degradation, realizing long-term device stability, but it also blocks lead leakage, preventing environmental contamination. Furthermore, Spiro-NPU endows PSCs with promising self-repairability, an ingenious strategy to elongate device lifetimes. Therefore, we show that internal encapsulation could be an effective and promising way to finally overcome the stability issues facing perovskite solar cells and to realize efficient, stable, repairable and low-lead-leakage PSCs.

Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs), as one of the most promising forms of technology for obtaining renewable and clean energy, have achieved power conversion efficiencies exceeding 25%,1i.e., matching those shown by Si-based solar cells. Monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells have achieved PCEs close to 30%.1 However, due to the ionic nature of perovskite materials, their long-term stability against moisture and heat remains poor, and this is still the most important obstacle preventing commercial application.2,3 In addition, lead leakage during usage remains an environmental safety concern.
Several strategies have been investigated to overcome the stability problem. The use of external encapsulating layers (EELs) based on hydrophobic polymers that physically block moisture intrusion is a universal method. For example, Fu et al.4 and Matteo et al.5 successively reported polyurethane (PU) as an EEL, resulting in the retention of 97.52% of the initial PCE after ∼2100 h of storage in an outdoor environment. Other polymeric EELs, such as epoxy;6 polyisobutylene (PIB);7 polyolefin (POE);8 ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA);9 and paraffin,10 have also been investigated. However, protection using EELs is rather limited since internal instabilities, e.g., lattice defects in the perovskite active layer11–13 and the diffusion of ions/molecules,14–17 are also key factors affecting the stability of a perovskite. Researchers have proposed utilizing an internal encapsulating layer (IEL) as a supplement or an alternative to an EEL to improve the stability of the perovskite film; this can involve grain boundary encapsulation via polymer doping in perovskite films,18–22 such as with polyethylene glycol (PEG) or polyurethane (PU), and perovskite/HTL interface encapsulation using polymeric interfacial materials,23–29 such as poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) and polystyrene (PS). However, the quantity of dopant or interface thickness can be quite low. Thus, poor long-term protection against moisture is obtained.
Attempts to tackle lead leakage have focused on interface engineering. For instance, Wu et al. introduced the metal–organic framework (MOF) ZrL3 to capture Pb2+ leakage from degraded films.30 Chen et al. doped a mesoporous sulfonic acid-based resin into the perovskite to fix the lead ions in place.31 In addition, EELs based on phosphonic acid,32 epoxy groups,33 and cation-exchange resin34 were also proven to effectively reduce lead leakage.
In our work, we have adopted an IEL layer to simultaneously maintain the efficiency and enhance the stability and lead blocking capabilities. Due to the better diffusion of small molecules than high-molecular-weight polymers,35 the higher morphology reproducibility36 obtained via in situ polymerization, and the stronger capabilities of cross-linked polymers to block moisture ingestion,37in situ cross-linked thick polymers are highly desired. We aimed to modify high-performing Spiro-OMeTAD HTMs via cross-linking to gain improved diffusion barrier properties with minimal effects on the electronic and chemical properties. Our designed and synthesized in situ co-polymerized IEL (Spiro-NPU), based on 2,2′,2′′,2′′′-(((9,9′-spirobi[fluorene]-2,2′,7,7′ tetrayltetrakis(phe-nylazanediyl))tet-rakis(ethane-2,1-diyl))tetr-akis(oxy))tetrakis(-etan-1-ol) (Spiro-OH) and 1,5-naphthalene diisocyanate (NDI) monomers, enhances moisture resistance and lead blockage by virtue of the spiro block and NCO and carbonyl groups.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The target internal encapsulating material, the cross-linked Spiro-NPU polymer, was obtained according to the synthetic route illustrated in Fig. 1a and Fig. S1 (ESI†). Mixed Spiro-OH and NDI solution in chlorobenzene (CB) was first pre-polymerized at 85 °C for 6 h, followed by hot spin-coating on top of the perovskite film. The as-obtained Spiro-NPU film was used without further purification.

(e) TRPL spectra of glass/CH3NH3PbI3, glass/CH3NH3PbI3/Spiro-NPU, glass/CH3NH3PbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD, and glass/CH3NH3PbI3/Spiro-NPU/Spiro-OMeTAD. 
From the Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra (Fig. 1b), the Spiro-NPU polymer shows characteristic peaks from the urethane group at 3336 cm−1 and 1718 cm−1, corresponding to the stretching vibrations of N–H and CO groups, respectively.18Spiro-NPU was found to terminate with NCO groups, because only a peak from the NCO group at 2266 cm−1 was observed, without the stretching vibrations of O–H bonds at ∼3446 cm−1, when comparing the FTIR spectra of Spiro–OH and NDI. This is further confirmed via checking their 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra (Fig. S2, ESI†), where the characteristic peak of –OH (4.52–4.50 ppm) disappears, with the appearance of a urethane group downfield (10–9 ppm) for Spiro-NPU. However, due to the poor solubility of Spiro-NPU, its molecular weight cannot be obtained; we therefore measured the corresponding molecular weight of the pre-polymer, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). In addition, as the melting point of Spiro-NPU cannot be determined via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC; Fig. S4, ESI†), we considered that the crosslinking degree of Spiro-NPU is relatively high.
The optical and electrochemical properties of the Spiro-NPU film were examined via UV-vis absorption spectrometry and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), and the optical bandgap (Eg) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level were determined to be 3.21 eV and −5.29 eV, respectively (Fig. S5–S7, ESI†). These results were also confirmed based on cyclic voltammetry (CV), as illustrated in Fig. S8 (ESI†). When compared with the energetic structures of perovskite materials, e.g., CH3NH3PbI3 and Cs0.05FA0.85MA0.10Pb(Br0.03I0.97)3, Spiro-NPU matches these well, and thus it enables the effective transfer of holes and the blocking of back-transfer electrons (Fig. S9 and Table S1, ESI†).
Subsequently, the morphology of the Spiro-NPU IEL on top of the perovskite film was studied via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As seen in Fig. 1c, the uniform and compact perovskite film was covered with the smooth and flat surface of Spiro-NPU. We have further confirmed the morphology of Spiro-NPUvia AFM, obtaining a low root-mean-square (RMS) value of 5.83 nm (Fig. S10, ESI†).
To elucidate the charge extraction and transportation capabilities of the Spiro-NPU IEL, on account of its position between the perovskite and hole-transport material, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements were conducted. As shown in Fig. 1d, the luminescence of the perovskite with Spiro-NPU was significantly quenched compared to that of pristine film, suggesting the decent hole extraction efficiency of Spiro-NPU. The calculated hole mobility for the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Spiro-NPU/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag device was 6.53 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, with the same order of magnitude as the device without Spiro-NPU (1.08 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) (Fig. S11, ESI†).38

Fig. 1e displays the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay curves, which could be fitted via the bi-exponential decay function: f(t) = A1 exp(−t/τ1) + A2 exp(−t/τ2), where A1 and A2 are the decay amplitudes and τ is the decay time. The fitting parameters are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). Generally, τ1 represents charge transfer from the perovskite to Spiro-OMeTAD, which relates to non-radiative recombination caused by surface defects, while τ2 represents the radiative recombination process caused by traps in the perovskite layer.39–41 Thereby, the observed shorter τave value, ca. 10.19 ns, indicates a quick photogenerated carrier transfer process from the perovskite to Spiro-OMeTAD when Spiro-NPU was inserted.
Photovoltaic performances of rigid and flexible devices
Based on these desirable properties of Spiro-NPU, we have fabricated n–i–p-type planar PSCs with the structural configuration of FTO/SnO2/CH3NH3PbI3/Spiro-NPU/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag, as shown in a cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. 2a). The thickness of Spiro-NPU is about 115 nm, and this was optimized based on the output of 20 independent PSCs fabricated with different concentrations of Spiro-NPU (Fig. S12, S13 and Table S3, ESI†). As seen in the current density–voltage (J–V) curves in Fig. 2b, a best PCE of 21.69% was achieved after inserting Spiro-NPU, with an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.15 V, a short circuit current density (JSC) of 23.58 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 80.28%. It is clear that the FF and VOC values were greatly enhanced when compared with a Spiro-NPU-free control device (PCE = 20.51%, JSC = 23.39 mA cm−2, FF = 77.83%, and VOC = 1.13 V) (Fig. S14, ESI†). This PCE was then further increased to 23.26% (JSC = 24.79 mA cm−2, FF = 79.49%, and VOC = 1.18 V) when Cs0.05FA0.85MA0.10Pb(Br0.03I0.97)3 was utilized as the light absorber, as shown in the J–V curves in Fig. 2b, and this value is also obviously better than the Spiro-NPU-free device.

The devices used in c, d, e, f, g, and i have the same active layer: Cs0.05FA0.85MA0.10Pb(Br0.03I0.97)3. 
This high PCE based on Cs0.05FA0.85MA0.10Pb(Br0.03I0.97)3 was confirmed via monitoring the stabilized output at the maximum power point (MPP) for the Spiro-NPU modified device under continuous AM 1.5G illumination. Fig. 2c reveals a stabilized PCE of 22.63% with a JSC value of 23.68 mA cm−2, which is in good agreement with the PCE obtained from the J–V curves. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements shown in Fig. 2d also exhibit an integrated JSC value of 24.12 mA cm−2, nearly equivalent to the JSC value obtained from J–V curves. The reproducibility of the devices was then verified via fabricating 30 independent devices, achieving an average PCE of 22.46% (Fig. 2e and Fig. S15, ESI†). The statistical distributions are summarized in Table S4 (ESI†). The average VOC, JSC, and FF values based on Spiro-NPU are 1.17 V, 24.65 mA cm−2, and 78.12% respectively, which are significantly larger than those of the control devices, especially VOC and FF.
Moreover, flexible PSCs were fabricated with a device configuration of PEN/ITO/SnO2/Cs0.05FA0.85MA0.10Pb(Br0.03I0.97)3/Spiro-NPU/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag. Fig. 2f shows the J–V curve of the best device, where a PCE of 20.37% (VOC = 1.14 V, JSC = 23.11 mA cm−2, and FF = 77.59%) was achieved. Upon tracking the PCE during repeated bending for over 5000 cycles at a small curvature radius (about 4 mm), the device with Spiro-NPU maintained over 80% of the original efficiency. This is highly related to the release of mechanical stress by the thick Spiro-NPU IEL due to the formation of tight contact during in situ synthesis; this is suggested by the observation of conspicuous peaks corresponding to Pb–O bonds42,43 between acylamino groups and Pb2+, at 137.2 eV and 142.2 eV, in the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra in Fig. 2g.
The mechanism of the enhanced performance was then investigated. In addition to XPS characterization (Fig. 2g), the strong interactions between the acylamino groups and Pb2+ were demonstrated via1H-NMR analysis, as shown in Fig. 2h and Fig. S16, (ESI†) where the Ha and Hb peaks shifted slightly downfield when PbI2 was added into Spiro-NPU solution;44 water was also added directly to Spiro-NPU solution to eliminate the influence of H2O on the NMR chemical shift. In combination with the calculated hole-trap density values (ca 6.53 × 1015 cm−3 and 9.45 × 1015 cm−3 for devices with and without Spiro-NPU, respectively, based on SCLC measurements (Fig. S17a, ESI†)45), the existence of effective trap passivation by Spiro-NPU at the perovskite surface was validated.
Further, trap-related recombination was analyzed via comparing the VOC dependence on light intensity, where the ideality factor (nid) represents the device diode characteristics correlating to non-radiative recombination.46 Fig. S17b (ESI†) exhibits a smaller nid value (1.65) for the Spiro-NPU modified device than the control device (2.63), which is attributed to reduced recombination, enhancing VOC and FF.22,47
In addition, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements and dark J–V measurements were conducted to evaluate the charge transport and recombination processes in the device. From the Nyquist plot presented in Fig. 2i, the semicircles in the high-frequency and low-frequency regions are generally assigned to charge transfer and recombination processes, respectively, corresponding to the Rtr and Rrec values, respectively.48,49 Thereby, the smaller semicircles of the device with Spiro-NPU are indicative of the facilitation of charge transport and the mitigation of recombination. In addition, based on the lower leakage current (J0) of the Spiro-NPU-modified device (2.98 × 10−8 mA cm−2) than that of the control device (1.77 × 10−7 mA cm−2) under both negative and positive bias voltages (Fig. S17c, ESI†), the same conclusion could be deduced: the addition of Spiro-NPU can clearly improve the hole transfer efficiency and decrease recombination loss.50
Stability and repairability of CH3NH3PbI3
Since CH3NH3PbI3 is the most commonly used light absorber and is also highly sensitive to humidity, it is adopted in order to demonstrate the encapsulating capabilities of our IEL. As an internal encapsulating material, the influence of Spiro-NPU on the moisture and thermal stability is of fundamental importance. Upon comparison with pristine CH3NH3PbI3 film, the water contact angle of perovskite/Spiro-NPU is obviously larger (110° vs. 52.6°) (Fig. S18, ESI†). Upon directly immersing the perovskite films into deionized water, as shown in Fig. 3a and Video S1 (ESI†), the bare film decomposed into yellow PbI2 at the moment of contact, followed by quick dissolution and lead contamination.32 In sharp contrast to that, the perovskite film protected with Spiro-NPU IEL shows amazing water resistance for over 15 min.

(e–g) The stability of perovskite devices with and without a Spiro-NPU IEL at various moisture and heat levels; the error bars represent standard deviations from ten samples under each condition. (h) Maximum power point tracking under full solar illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) in a glovebox. 
Furthermore, we tracked the optical and crystalline properties of the perovskite films during decomposition at 85% RH over one week (Fig. 3b). The perovskite film covered with the Spiro-NPU IEL maintained its black phase over the whole week, whereas the pristine perovskite film deteriorated from a black phase to a transparent hydrated phase and yellow PbI2. This is confirmed based on XRD; obvious hydrated derivative peaks (2θ = 10.6° and 8.5°) and a PbI2 peak (2θ = 12.6°)51 developed for the pristine perovskite film, while in the case of the Spiro-NPU IEL, only a weak monohydrate peak (2θ = 8.5°) was observed (Fig. 3c and d).52
Upon extending the aging time to one month at 85% RH, completely transparent hydrated perovskite films were obtained. However, after heating (100 °C, 1 min) or irradiating at 1 sun (8 min), this hydrated Spiro-NPU-IEL-protected perovskite film surprisingly returned to a black mirror morphology, showing vital repairability, which can help to extend the overall lifetime of a PSC. This phenomenon is mainly due to the fact that in the Spiro-NPU IEL, only CH3NH3PbI3·H2O53,54 was formed, without further decomposing into PbI2, as illustrated by the XRD studies shown in Fig. S19 and S20 (ESI†).
As reported in the literature,51,53 the decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3 catalyzed by water follows the reversible reaction eqn (1)–(3) given below: (1) (2) (3)
Therefore, based on the XRD results (Fig. S19 and S20, ESI†), after the aging process, both hydrates and PbI2 appeared. We considered that the decomposition of the perovskite without Spiro-NPU at high humidity includes the processes given above in eqn (1)–(3). In detail, for the aged device without Spiro-NPU, escaping gas (CH3NH2 and HI) can destroy the continuity and smoothness of Spiro-OMeTAD and the metal electrode.53 Moreover, the loss of CH3NH2 and HI from the active layer may greatly reduce the extent of recovery. In contrast, even after a long-term aging process, the XRD patterns of the perovskite with Spiro-NPU only showed hydrate peaks, thus indicating that the process given in eqn (3) did not happen during decomposition, which is possibly attributed to the protection of Spiro-NPU, which blocks the volatilization of methylamine gas and facilitates the reverse reaction, as displayed in Fig. S21 (ESI†).
Simultaneously, the stability of perovskite devices with a Spiro-NPU IEL against moisture and heat has also been investigated without any external encapsulation. The device structure is FTO/SnO2/CH3NH3PbI3/Spiro-NPU/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au, and the PCEs were monitored at the open circuit voltage. After exposure to 60% RH (room temperature in air) for over 3000 h, nearly 100% of the initial PCE was remained (Fig. 3e). Also, at 85 °C (55% RH in air) or 85% RH (25 °C in air) for over 500 h, the PCE still retained over 90% of its initial value (Fig. 3f and g). As the surfaces of the devices are slightly wet at 85% RH, the PCE values of aged devices were measured after 1 min of thermal annealing at 100 °C. For comparison, an aged device without thermal post-treatment maintained 70% of the original PCE (Fig. 3g). By contrast, a reference device without Spiro-NPU only preserved 42% of the initial efficiency after 7 days of aging, and this recovered to 55% after the same thermal process. Therefore, it is concluded that Spiro-NPU can assist the recovery of devitalized PSCs.
We further explored the stability of PSCs with Spiro-NPU (with thermal post-treatment), as shown in Fig. S22, (ESI†) under an ambient atmosphere (60% RH at 25 °C) over 30 days. The aged PSCs with thermal post-treatment maintained ∼91% of their initial PCEs, or ∼83% of the original efficiency of pristine PSCs. The corresponding highest PCEs are 22.87%, 21.01%, and 19.41% for pristine PSCs, PSCs subjected to thermal post-treatment, and aged PSCs subjected to thermal post-treatment, respectively. We also tested the stabilized power output (SPO) values of fresh and recovered devices over 20 min, as shown in Fig. S23, (ESI†) where a recovered device showed the same operational stability as a fresh device.
Meanwhile, the device with Spiro-NPU maintained 97% of its initial PCE after operating at the maximum power point (MPP) under 1 sun illumination (∼50 °C in a glovebox) for 200 h (Fig. 3h), demonstrating excellent operational stability. Therefore, we conclude that the Spiro-NPU IEL prominently enhances the moisture and thermal stability of PSCs.
Due to the fact that the hydrophilicity of the additives in Spiro-OMeTAD, such as lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) and tertbutylpyridine (tBP), can affect the long-term stability of perovskites,55 the migration of dopants was also assessed. Li-TFSI and 4-tBP were deposited on top of FTO/Spiro-NPU, followed by exposure to 85% RH (25 °C) for over 500 h, and we carried out in-depth XPS analysis (Ar+, 1 keV) on this aged film with etching times of 0 s, 120 s, 240 s, 360 s, 480 s, and 600 s. As shown in Fig. S24a and b, (ESI†) 600 s of etching does not fully etch Spiro-NPU; thus, the appearance of Li-TFSI and 4-tBP in Fig. S24c and d (ESI†) reveals that the migration of dopants into Spiro-NPU is limited, which also explains the long-term stability of the IEL-protected devices.
Lead leakage
The lead blocking capabilities of the Spiro-NPU IEL were then studied via soaking CH3NH3PbI3 film (film size: 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm × 520 nm) directly in 10 mL of deionized water; then, the Pb concentration in water was detected via flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry (FAAS).32 As seen in Fig. 4a, in the first hour, the concentration of Pb rapidly increased and reached a platform of 17 ppm for the pristine perovskite film, whereas hardly any Pb was found dissolved in water when the perovskite was covered with the Spiro-NPU IEL. Upon further increasing the soaking time of the perovskite wrapped with the Spiro-NPU IEL to 3 h, it was a surprise to observe a yellow film instead of a colorless one as seen for the bare perovskite. According to XRD analysis (Fig. 4b), the yellow film is due to the production of pure PbI2, which explains why no Pb2+ was detected in the aqueous solution. Meanwhile, an FTO/CH3NH3PbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD device was also soaked in water for over 30 min. As observed in Fig. S25, (ESI†) PbI2 was completely dissolved in water, leading to high levels of contamination.

(c) The spatial distributions of Pb+, I+, C+, and N+ in FTO/perovskite/Spiro-NPU. (d) Depth profiles of CH3NH3PbI3 with Spiro-NPU. 
To understand this extraordinary property, the above decomposed yellow PbI2/Spiro-NPU film was probed via time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS),56–58 which can detect the depth distributions of ions. The depth profiles of Pb+, I+, C+, and N+ are displayed in Fig. 4c and d, where C+ and N+ come from Spiro-NPU, while Pb+ and I+ can be attributed to PbI2. It is noted that nearly no Pb+ or I+ were detected near the top surface of the Spiro-NPU IEL, while at the PbI2/Spiro-NPU interface, their concentrations gradually increased and reached a maximum at the PbI2 layer. Thus, the Spiro-NPU IEL trapped almost all Pb2+ in a small area due to Pb–O interactions, as indicated in the XPS and 1H-NMR results (Fig. 2g and h), realizing prominent lead blockage. To confirm this claim, we extended the soaking time in water and tracked the Pb2+ concentration (Fig. S26, ESI†). In the first 20 days, the Pb concentration was limited at a very low level, less than 1 ppm, and this was followed by a slow increase in the following 30 days to ca. 8 ppm on average. Upon further leaving the almost fully dissolved device in water, the Pb concentration remained constant (∼8 ppm on average and a maximum of 10 ppm), demonstrating the final steady state of Pb leakage. This value is still comparatively lower than the Pb concentration (∼17 ppm) from a control device soaked for 1 h. Therefore, even during long-term soaking, Spiro-NPU can still effectively block lead leakage.

Spiro-PPU

On account of the above-discussed properties and influence of the Spiro-NPU IEL, the structure of the internal encapsulating material was adjusted, including the type of diisocyanate and the selection of the alkoxy chain. For instance, Spiro-PPU was also synthesized via changing the NDI block to 1,4-phenylene diisocyanate (PPDI) (Scheme S1, ESI†). Based on similar detailed investigations, this material shows the same optical and electrical properties and excellent performance as Spiro-NPU (ESI†). Therefore, we are confident that our designed IEL is an efficient and multifunctional internal encapsulation material for devices based on organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites.
Conclusions
In summary, a multifunctional internal encapsulation material based on in situ co-polymerized cross-linkable Spiro-NPU was obtained for use in perovskite solar cells. With its compatibility with Spiro-OMeTAD and high hole mobility, Spiro-NPU imparts solar cells with high efficiencies of ca 23.26% on a rigid substrate and 20.37% on a flexible substrate. More importantly, the insertion of the Spiro-NPU IEL results in remarkable enhancements in terms of the moisture and thermal stability of perovskite films and devices. Perovskite film protected with the Spiro-NPU IEL shows amazing water resistance for over 15 min and retains nearly 100% of its initial PCE after aging in air (60% RH, 25 °C) for more than 3000 h. Moreover, after long-term aging, the photovoltaic-inactive hydrated phase of the perovskite film could be converted back into the photovoltaic-active black phase after annealing (or irradiation at one sun); therefore, the PSCs have also demonstrated promising repairability. Finally, based on the interaction of Pb–O with the perovskite and the Spiro-NPU IEL, lead leakage from the perovskite film has been eliminated, which is an excellent and highly desired outcome from an environmental perspective. Therefore, we believe that internal encapsulation is an effective and promising way to finally overcome the stability issues faced by perovskite solar cells and other devices based on organic–inorganic perovskite materials, especially with the synergetic effect of a suitable EEL.

Broader context
Long-term stability is a critical problem preventing the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we propose an in situ cross-linked polymer (Spiro-NPU) as an internal encapsulating layer (IEL) with strong hydrophobicity. In this strategy, the Spiro-NPU IEL not only protects perovskite films against moisture-, heat-, and defect-induced degradation, realizing long-term device stability, but it also blocks lead leakage, preventing environmental contamination. Furthermore, Spiro-NPU endows PSCs with promising self-repairability, an ingenious strategy to elongate device lifetimes. Therefore, we show that internal encapsulation could be an effective and promising way to finally overcome the stability issues facing perovskite solar cells and to realize efficient, stable, repairable and low-lead-leakage PSCs.
