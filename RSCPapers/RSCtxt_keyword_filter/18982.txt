    , Accepted 13th September 2017First published on 14th September 2017AbstractA novel furo[3,2-c]pyridine based Ir complex, namely (pfupy)2Ir(acac), has been developed by replacing sulfur with oxygen in the C^N ligand. Compared with the thiophene-containing (pthpy)2Ir(acac), the LUMO level is elevated while the HOMO level remains almost unchanged for the resultant furan-containing (pfupy)2Ir(acac). As a consequence, the emissive maximum is blue-shifted from 556 nm of (pthpy)2Ir(acac) to 538 nm of (pfupy)2Ir(acac) together with an improved photoluminescence quantum yield of 0.80. The corresponding device based on (pfupy)2Ir(acac) realizes a record-high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 30.5% (110.5 cd A−1) without any out-coupling technology. Even at a luminance of 1000 and 5000 cd m−2, the EQE still remains at 26.6% (96.4 cd A−1) and 25.6% (92.7 cd A−1), respectively, indicative of the gentle efficiency roll-off. The results clearly demonstrate the great potential of furan-based functional materials applied in OLEDs.
The development of organic electronics has promoted the ongoing search for new organic semiconducting materials,1–11 such as furan-based compounds.12–16 Compared with the thiophene analogues, these furan derivatives have a tendency to be more tightly packed13 because of the smaller atomic radius of oxygen (1.52 Å) than that of sulfur (1.80 Å), which facilitates carrier transport in the solid state.17 Meanwhile, the larger electronegativity of oxygen relative to that of sulfur may deepen the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels, implying the possibility of higher open-circuit voltages.18 In addition, they are highly emissive, whose photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) are found to be impressively enhanced after the exchange of sulfur for oxygen.19 Inspired by such characteristics, nowadays a series of furan-based semiconductors has been successfully exploited for organic solar cells (OSCs) and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). For example, a 2D benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran conjugated polymer PBDF-T1 was presented as a promising candidate for highly efficient OSCs, revealing a distinguished power conversion efficiency of 9.4%.18 And a furan–thiophene quinoidal compound TFT-CN was designed to show a high electron mobility up to 7.7 cm2 V−1 s−1, two orders of magnitude higher than that of the only thiophene-based quinoidal TTT-CN.20 However, in the aspect of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), the study of the respective functional materials containing furan has received less attention.21
In this communication, we report a novel iridium (Ir) complex (pfupy)2Ir(acac) by using furo[3,2-c]pyridine as the ligand. As depicted in Fig. 1, the replacement of sulfur by oxygen in the C^N ligand leads to an up-shift of the Ir complex's LUMO level without varying its HOMO level. Compared to the thiophene-containing reference (pthpy)2Ir(acac) (λem = 556 nm, ΦPL = 0.68), a hypsochromic emission of 538 nm is observed for the resultant furan-containing complex (pfupy)2Ir(acac) associated with a PLQY of 0.80. Without any out-coupling technology, the corresponding device based on (pfupy)2Ir(acac) gives a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) as high as 30.5% (110.5 cd A−1), which slightly decays to 25.6% (92.7 cd A−1) even at a high luminance of 5000 cd m−2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on furan-based functional materials used for high-performance OLEDs.
 Fig. 1  The molecular structures of (pthpy)2Ir(acac) and (pfupy)2Ir(acac) (a) and their corresponding HOMO/LUMO distributions obtained from DFT calculations (b). 
As described in Scheme S1 (ESI†), a modified procedure was adopted for the synthesis of (pfupy)2Ir(acac). Starting from furfural that is cheap and widely used in industry, a Knoevenagel reaction was performed to give 2-furanacrylic acid (1). Then 1 was converted to its corresponding azide intermediate (2), followed by cyclization to afford furo[3,2-c]pyridin-4-ol (3). During the cyclization, diphenyl ether was initially utilized as the high boiling point solvent,22 inevitably leading to the blockage of the constant pressure funnel caused by its melting point of 28 °C being only slightly higher than room temperature. To solve this problem, two methods were tried: (i) a hot wind was provided to melt diphenyl ether, but this method failed because azide 2 was partially decomposed before being dropped into the reactive flask; (ii) diphenyl ether was replaced by another solvent with simultaneous low melting and high boiling points. So Dowtherm® A (m.p. = 11 °C, b.p. = 258 °C) came into our sight, which is developed by the Dow Chemical Company as a heat transfer fluid. In Dowtherm® A, azide 2 could be well dissolved and the cyclized product 3 was found to be recrystallized upon cooling. With the easy achievement of 3, the furo[3,2-c]pyridine-based C^N ligand 5 could be facilely obtained after the chloro-hydroxyl exchange and subsequent Suzuki cross-coupling. Finally, the desired furan-containing Ir complex (pfupy)2Ir(acac) was prepared according to a well-known two-step route.23 For comparison, the thiophene-based anologue (pthpy)2Ir(acac) was also synthesized as the reference. Their corresponding molecular structures were fully characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and elemental analysis (Fig. S1, ESI†). In addition, they are both thermally stable, possessing a decomposition temperature of over 350 °C without any glass transition in the range of 25–300 °C (Fig. S2, ESI†).
Single crystals of (pthpy)2Ir(acac) and (pfupy)2Ir(acac) suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis were grown from the mixed solvents of dichloromethane and methanol. As can be seen in Fig. 2, both the Ir complexes assume the same pseudo-octahedral coordination geometry around the Ir atom, retaining the mutual trans-N,N- and cis-C,C-chelate disposition of the chloride-bridged precursors. The average Ir–C bond length of (pfupy)2Ir(acac) (1.980(6) Å) is close to that of (pthpy)2Ir(acac) (1.979(4) Å), whereas the average Ir–N and Ir–O bond lengths of (pfupy)2Ir(acac) (2.042(5) Å and 2.158(4) Å, respectively) are longer than those of (pthpy)2Ir(acac) (2.034(3) Å and 2.150(2) Å, respectively) (Tables S1–S3, ESI†). Furthermore, a π–π interaction between furo[3,2-c]pyridine and the phenyl ring with a contact distance of 3.460–3.704 Å is observed in the furan-containing complex (pfupy)2Ir(acac) (Fig. S3, ESI†). This is quite different from the thiophene-containing complex (pthpy)2Ir(acac), showing an obvious packing between two neighboring thieno[3,2-c]pyridine units (Fig. S4, ESI†).

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to investigate the electrochemical property of (pfupy)2Ir(acac) compared with (pthpy)2Ir(acac). Similar to (pthpy)2Ir(acac), (pfupy)2Ir(acac) exhibits a quasi-reversible oxidation wave (Fig. S5, ESI†). The HOMO energy level of (pfupy)2Ir(acac) (−5.15 eV) is nearly the same as that of (pthpy)2Ir(acac) (−5.14 eV). During cathodic sweeping, nevertheless, an irreversible reduction occurs at a more negative potential for (pfupy)2Ir(acac). Its corresponding LUMO energy level is determined to be −2.40 eV, which is about 0.12 eV higher than that of (pthpy)2Ir(acac) (−2.52 eV). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were further carried out on the basis of the geometries from the X-ray diffraction data. As for both the complexes (pthpy)2Ir(acac) and (pfupy)2Ir(acac), the HOMO mainly comes from the π-orbital of phenyl and the t2g orbital of the Ir ion, while the LUMO is distributed on phenyl and thieno[3,2]pyridyl or furo[3,2-c]pyridyl segments (Fig. 1b). Reasonably, on going from (pthpy)2Ir(acac) to (pfupy)2Ir(acac), the calculated HOMO levels remain almost unchanged, and the LUMO ones are found to be up-shifted owing to the more electron-rich character of furan than thiophene.13 The trend is in good agreement with the CV experiments.

Fig. 3 illustrates the UV-Vis and photoluminescence (PL) spectra in solutions for (pthpy)2Ir(acac) and (pfupy)2Ir(acac). As can be clearly seen, they both show multiple absorption bands: the strong bands below 400 nm are attributed to the spin-allowed 1π–π* transition of the cyclometalated C^N ligands; the 400–450 nm shoulders can be assigned to the spin-allowed metal to ligand charge transfer transition (1MLCT); and the weak absorption above 450 nm originates from the mixing of 3π–π* and 3MLCT transitions.24 Despite this, the absorption spectrum of (pfupy)2Ir(acac) moves towards a shorter wavelength with respect to (pthpy)2Ir(acac). Correspondingly, the maximum emission is blue-shifted from 556 nm of (pthpy)2Ir(acac) to 538 nm of (pfupy)2Ir(acac), which is consistent with the above-mentioned electrochemical behaviour. Furthermore, attributable to the faster radiative decay rate and the lower non-radiative decay rate, (pfupy)2Ir(acac) has an improved PL quantum efficiency of 0.80 as well as a close lifetime of 1.04 μs (Table 1 and Fig. S6, ESI†). These observations clearly demonstrate the superiority of furan-containing materials to thiophene-containing ones.

To evaluate the electroluminescence (EL) property, the device of (pfupy)2Ir(acac) was fabricated with a configuration of ITO/MoO3 (10 nm)/TAPC (60 nm)/TCTA (5 nm)/CBP: x wt% (pfupy)2Ir(acac) (20 nm)/BmPyPB (35 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (Fig. S7, ESI†). Here MoO3 and LiF serve as the hole- and electron-injecting materials, respectively; TAPC (4,4′-(cyclohexane-1,1-diyl)bis(N,N-di-p-tolylaniline)) and BmPyPB (3,3′′,5,5′′-tetra(pyridin-3-yl)-1,1′:3′,1′′-terphenyl) act as the hole- and electron-transporting materials, respectively; TCTA (tris(4-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)phenyl)amine) is selected as the buffer layer25 as well as the exciton-blocking material; and (pfupy)2Ir(acac) is doped into the host CBP (4,4′-di(9H-carbazol-9-yl)-1,1′-biphenyl) as the emitting layer. The triplet energy of CBP (2.6 eV) is higher than that of (pfupy)2Ir(acac) (2.3 eV), thus avoiding the triplet energy back transfer from (pfupy)2Ir(acac) to CBP. And the doping concentration is tuned in the range of 4–12 wt% to optimize the device performance.
The EL spectrum matches well with the PL counterpart (Inset in Fig. 4), suggesting that the EL is mainly from the Ir complex (pfupy)2Ir(acac). Meanwhile, it is almost independent of the doping concentration, giving similar Commission internationale de l’eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.44, 0.55). Despite this, with the increasing doping concentration, the turn-on voltage (at 1 cd m−2) is reduced from 3.2 V to 2.8 V, and the current density at the same driving voltage is found to be enhanced gradually (Fig. S8a, ESI†). Given the much elevated HOMO of (pfupy)2Ir(acac) than that of CBP, the high doping concentration could promote the direct exciton generation in (pfupy)2Ir(acac), leading to a lower driving voltage and improved efficiency. Consequently, the best device performance is achieved at 12 wt% content, with a peak current efficiency of 110.5 cd A−1, a peak power efficiency of 124.0 lm W−1 and a peak EQE of 30.5% (Fig. 4, Fig. S8b and Table S4, ESI†). Even at a high luminance of 1000 and 5000 cd m−2, the EQE still maintains at 26.6% and 25.6%, respectively, revealing an attenuation of about 12.8% and 16.1% relative to the maximum value. As discussed above, the fast radiative decay rate may be responsible for such a slow efficiency roll-off at high luminance, which is beneficial to prevent the triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA)26 and triplet–polaron annihilation (TPA).27 To our knowledge, the performance including the efficiency and its gentle efficiency roll-off is among the best ever reported for green devices without any out-coupling technology.28–30

Under the same conditions, the reference device based on 12 wt% Ir(ppy)3 doped into CBP gives an inferior EQE of 24.9% despite the different CIE coordinates (Fig. S9 and Table S4, ESI†). Therefore, the obtained EQE of over 30% for (pfupy)2Ir(acac) is beyond our expectations. The EQE can be well described by the following equation:31 EQE = γ × ηr × ηPL × ηout = γ × ηPL × ηout(1)where γ is the ratio of the recombined carriers to the injected carriers; ηr is the efficiency of radiative exciton production; ηPL is the PL quantum efficiency and ηout is the light out-coupling constant. Assuming that both γ and ηr are close to 1 as well as the determined ηPL of 0.80, ηout is estimated to be at least 0.38 according to eqn (1), much higher than the theoretical value.32 Consistent with the literature studies,33–35 the favorable horizontal orientation of (pfupy)2Ir(acac) in CBP may tentatively contribute to the high ηout and thus over 30% EQE when free of any out-coupling technology. Further experiments should be performed to verify this hypothesis, but they are now beyond the aim of this work.
In summary, we have newly designed and synthesized a furo[3,2-c]pyridine based Ir complex (pfupy)2Ir(acac) by replacing sulfur with oxygen in the C^N ligand. Such a small variation of the molecular structure brings about the elevated LUMO level and the unaffected HOMO level, thus resulting in a blue-shifted emission. The corresponding device of (pfupy)2Ir(acac) realizes a state-of-the-art EQE of 30.5% at maximum and 25.6% even at 5000 cd m−2. In view of the achieved promising device efficiency associated with the gentle roll-off at high luminance, we believe that this work will shed light on the development of furan-based functional materials used for OLEDs in the future.
