Introduction
It is known that diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) and isoindigo, which contain a heterocyclic lactam structure, are two of the most famous building blocks for organic electronic materials in recent years, owing to their strong electron-deficient properties and prominent planarity. Particularly, they have been proven to be greatly promising and successful acceptor building blocks in copolymers for organic photovoltaic applications.1–5 Being inspired and motivated by the appealing achievements of these two units with a five-membered lactam ring, we attempt to make a preliminary inquiry into whether a monomer containing a six-membered lactam structure, could be comparable to DPP and isoindigo in such a rapidly advancing area of polymer solar cells (PSCs). Hence, we design a novel unit of pyrido[2,3,4,5-lmn]phenanthridine-5,10-dione (PPD) by fusing two benzene rings with a couple of six-membered lactam rings with characteristic rigidity and coplanarity. PPD could be seen as a derivative of pyrido[2,3,4,5-lmn]phenanthridine. It is worth mentioning that, despite their early interest in pharmaceutical chemistry and a yellow vat dye like flavanthrone, little is known of the chemistry of pyrido[2,3,4,5-lmn]phenanthridine and its derivatives,6 and it has never before been utilized as a building block in the field of organic electronics. This lack of interest has been largely due to the difficulty of its synthesis. Theoretical calculations by using density functional theory (DFT) (Gaussian 03W) revealed that,7 unlike the noted DPP and isoindigo which are strong electron acceptor units, the electron-withdrawing capacity of the alkylated PPD unit are comparatively weak. As shown in Fig. 1, the calculated LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energy level of 4,9-dimethylpyrido[2,3,4,5-lmn]phenanthridine-5,10-dione (DMPPD) is −2.17 eV, which is much higher than that of 2,5-dimethylpyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DMDPP) (−2.67 eV) and 1,1′-dimethylisoindigo (DMII) (−3.06 eV). Considering its relatively higher-lying LUMO energy level, donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated polymers consisting of PPD as the acceptor unit and common donor units may have relatively broad band gaps.

Although a considerable number of new monomers and their D–A conjugated polymers have been designed and synthesized for PSCs, the vast majority of research groups focus their efforts on developing low or medium band gap donor materials due to the demand for more light absorption,8–14 and there are a number of literature reports that have described power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of single-layer devices achieving 7%.15–18 However, the potential of large band gap polymers with an absorption onset shorter than 600 nm, which may complement the low band gap donor in devices with a tandem structure, seems to have been ignored or underestimated. P3HT (poly[3-hexylthiophene]) and PCDTBT (poly[N-9′-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)]) are two typical representatives for medium band gap polymers (Eg ≈ 1.9 eV) which have been extensively studied in OPV.8,19–22 We wonder whether we can obtain a moderate performance by further enlarging the band gap of donor polymers to above 2.0 eV. However, earlier studies about large band gap donor materials have shown significant effort but did not display a potential accomplishment. Zhang et al. reported a bithiazole and carbazole-based large band gap polymer (Eg = 2.21 eV) which gave a PCE of 0.3%.23 More recently, Li's group developed another carbazole-based polymer PCzTh–TVCN (Eg = 2.18 eV) which displayed a PCE of 2.2%.24 Despite the lower use of the full solar spectrum, large band gap polymers still have their application value in tandem devices. Although the PCEs of PSCs based on large band gap polymers are obviously far behind their counterparts based on low or medium band gap polymers, mainly due to their deficiency in taking full advantage of the solar spectrum, there is still room for improvement, and efficient large band gap materials can be expected.
Results and discussion
Material design, synthesis and characterization
To provide enough solubility for the object polymers, alkylation of the PPD unit on the N atom was performed. It is interesting that the reaction of bromoalkane with the original PPD gives three novel pyrido[2,3,4,5-lmn]phenanthridine derivatives, the N-alkylated product of 4,9-dialkylpyrido[2,3,4,5-lmn]phenanthridine-5,10-dione (DAPPD), the O-alkylated product of 5,10-dialkoxypyrido[2,3,4,5-lmn]phenanthridine (DAOPP), and the O- and N-alkylated product of 10-alkoxy-4-alkylpyrido[2,3,4,5-lmn]phenanthridin-5-one (AOAPPO), simultaneously. This phenomenon could be attributed to the electronic rearrangements which take place after the formation of nitrogen anions under alkaline conditions (Scheme 1). Fortunately, pure products were obtained through the successful isolation of these isomers by column chromatography. Considering their rigid and planar structure, the three isomers of DAPPD, AOAPPO and DAOPP were also used as building blocks to construct optoelectronic polymers with a rigid coplanar backbone, leading to a highly extended π-electron system and facilitating interchain packing of the resulting polymer which is helpful for the enhancement of carrier mobility.25

Scheme 2 depicts the synthetic routes of the three isomers and the corresponding polymers. The synthetic procedures of 2–4 have been reported in an early literature report.26 To ensure adequate solubility of the final polymers, a branched hydrocarbon chain, 2-butyloctane, was chosen for attaching to compound 4 which possesses a bulky planar structure, and three N- and/or O-alkylated isomers of 5a, 5b and 5c were simultaneously yielded in the alkylation reaction at 100 °C due to the electronic rearrangements. The yield of 5b (∼38%) is higher than that of 5a (∼18%) and 5c (∼10%), and it may be attributed to the comparatively higher content and/or better stability of the corresponding intermediate ionic compound at this temperature. It is of interest that a higher reaction temperature may lead to a further lower yield of 5a, and a lower reaction temperature may reduce the reactivity, giving a lower yield of all the alkylated isomers. Finally, the pivotal monomers 7a, 7b and 7c were synthesized by the combination of 5a, 5b and 5c with 2-trimethylstannyl-thiophene via a simple Stille cross-coupling reaction, followed by a bromination reaction with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in chloroform. There is a significant number of reports which have shown that benzo[1,2-b;3,4-b]dithiophene (BDT) derivatives are excellent donor units in the PSC polymer materials because of their planar conjugated structure.16,18,25,27 The phenyl ring of BDT lessens the electron-rich capacity of the whole unit, and accordingly lowers the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) energy level. These intrinsic properties are helpful for improving the charge mobility and the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the devices. Therefore, a BDT derivative of 4,8-di[(2-butyloctane)oxy-benzo[1,2-b;3,4-b]dithiophene was chosen as the donor unit alternate with DAPPD, AOAPPO and DAOPP to construct the large band gap copolymers.
 Scheme 2  Synthesis of pyrido[2,3,4,5-lmn]phenanthridine derivatives and their copolymers. 
Copolymerizations of 7a, 7b and 7c with 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-di[(2-butyloctane)oxy-benzo[1,2-b;3,4-b]dithiophene (8) were respectively carried out by a common palladium-catalyzed Stille cross-coupling reaction to give copolymers Pa, Pb and Pc. The resulting polymers showed enough solubility in chloroform, chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene, and the colours of their solutions are yellow to orange. The number average molecular weights (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) of the synthesized polymers Pa, Pb and Pc were measured by high-temperature gel permeation chromatography (HT-GPC) in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene using polystyrene standards and were found to be 31.7 kDa (PDI = 2.4) for Pa, 24.9 kDa (PDI = 2.1) for Pb and 22.6 kDa (PDI = 2.0) for Pc. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that the onset temperatures with a 5% weight-loss (Td) under nitrogen, of all three polymers are above 330 °C, and that there is no obvious phase transition process detected for any of the resulting polymers during the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) characterization in the range of 0 to 250 °C. These results indicate that these polymers possess good thermal and morphological stability which is a prerequisite for processing and device application.
To evaluate the frontier molecular orbitals and energy band gaps of the copolymers, computational studies were also carried out upon their repeat units. The molecular structures were simplified by replacing the alkyls with methyl groups. The simulation results reveal that the HOMO energy levels are −5.48, −5.51 and −5.42 eV with energy band gaps (Ecalg) of 2.94, 3.07 and 3.14 eV for the repeating units of Pa, Pb and Pc, respectively. According to the UV-vis absorption spectra of these three polymers both in the film spin-coated on quartz substrates and in the dilute chloroform solution are shown in Fig. 2, all polymers exhibit a dual absorption band and strong 0–1 vibrational peaks. The absorption maxima of the polymers in solid films are slightly red-shifted from 514 nm for Pc to 518 nm for Pb and 526 nm for Pa, indicating that there are little differences between the electron-withdrawing abilities of these three isomers of DAPPD, AOAPPO and DAOPP, which serve as an acceptor unit in the corresponding polymers, but that DAPPD is the strongest. This phenomenon may be due to the electron-donating alkoxy groups in AOAPPO and DAOPP. It was also supported by the calculated frontier molecular orbital distributions. Although the LUMOs for all the polymers are located along the polymer backbone, the LUMO of Pa is mostly located in the unit of DAPPD combined with thiophene. The optical band gaps (Eoptg) of these polymers were estimated to be 2.13 eV for Pa, 2.19 eV for Pb and 2.21 eV for Pc from the absorption edges and this increasing trend of band gap from Pa to Pc is consistent with the theoretical calculation of their repeating units. These results suggest that the variety of isomers in the main chain has a slight effect on the optical properties of the resulting polymers. As expected, the energy band gaps of the polymers based on the pyrido[2,3,4,5-lmn]phenanthridine derivatives are much wider than those of the polymers based on DPP and isoindigo. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to measure the HOMO energy levels of these polymers by using ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) (which has an absolute energy level of −4.8 eV) as a calibration.28 The HOMO energy levels of Pa, Pb, and Pc were calculated from the onset oxidation potential (Eox) and were estimated to be −5.41, −5.34 and −5.30 eV, respectively. The exact values are slightly different from the calculated values as the theoretically estimated one is in the gas phase with isolated repeating units in contrast to the experimentally estimated one which is in the condense phase with polymers; the tendency of the experimentally estimated energy levels is approximately consistent with that of the theoretically estimated one. Notably, it was found that the HOMO energy levels of all the resulting polymers slightly increased with decreasing electron-withdrawing capacity of the acceptor units, in spite of their donor unit being exactly the same. It should be pointed out that the reductive curves of the copolymers could hardly be obtained. Therefore the LUMO energy levels of the polymers were estimated from their HOMO energy levels and the optical band gaps and were −3.28, −3.15 and −3.13 eV for Pa, Pb, and Pc, respectively.

Photovoltaic performance
In order to probe the photovoltaic properties of the resulting polymers, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs were fabricated and tested with a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al, and the thickness of the active layer consisting of polymer:PC71BM blend (1:1, by weight) was 90 nm. The current density–voltage (J–V) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) characteristics of the devices are depicted in Fig. 3. The devices based on Pc delivered a PCE of 2.15% with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 5.46 mA cm−2, an VOC of 0.66 V and a fill factor (FF) of 59.6%. The Pb-based devices only demonstrated a JSC of 1.51 mA cm−2, an VOC of 0.66 V and an undesirable PCE of 0.46%, probably due to the asymmetrical structure of the AOAPPO unit. Among the PSCs tested in this study, the best performance was achieved by Pa:PC71BM with a JSC of 7.32 mA cm−2, an VOC of 0.78 V and a FF of 60.9%, thus a PCE of 3.47%. The EQE of the solar cells was measured under illumination of monochromatic light. As shown in Fig. 3, although there is no obvious difference in the optical properties of these polymers, they exhibit significant disparity in the conversion efficiency of the devices. All the devices have a response range from 380 to 700 nm, but the Pa-based device shows more efficient photo-conversion efficiency in the range of 400–550 nm, and obviously, the Pb-based device exhibits the lowest conversion efficiency.

The discrepancy in charge carrier mobility examined by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) model and the variation in film morphology, measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) of the active layer, could interpret the low efficiency of the Pb-based device to some extent (see ESI†). The AFM phase images reveal that the Pb:PC71BM film displays a very large domain size over 250 nm which may be due to the poor affinity between Pb and the fullerene derivative and will be fairly disadvantageous to the exciton dissociation. In addition, the hole mobility is 8.3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for Pa:PC71BM, 4.9 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for Pc:PC71BM and 1.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for Pb:PC71BM, and both the Pa and Pc-based devices have higher hole mobility than the Pb-based devices. Combining the comparatively low hole mobility and the unsatisfactory morphology of the Pb:PC71BM film, it is not difficult to understand the low JSC and FF of the Pb-based device. Compared with the AOAPPO unit, the DAPPD and DAOPP units with their symmetrical structures are more superior in charge transport, which may be due to the good π–π stacking of the resulting polymers and they can therefore be potential candidates for the field of organic electronics.
Besides conventional device structure, inverted devices using a cross-linkable polymer PF3N-OX (poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-bis(3-ethyl(oxetane-3-ethyloxy)-hexyl)-fluorene)]) as a cathode modification layer to facilitate charge carrier collection and to lower the work function of ITO, were also fabricated in a configuration of ITO/PF3N-OX/Pa:PC71BM/MoO3/Al.29 A further improved performance was achieved for the inverted device that displayed a JSC of 8.19 mA cm−2, an enhanced VOC of 0.92 V, and a FF of 60.2%, resulting in a PCE of 4.54%, which is hitherto the highest efficiency of BHJ PSCs using a donor polymer with a band gap above 2.1 eV. Despite the relatively large band gap, the performance of the Pa-based inverted device is superior to that of a typical isoindigo- and BDT-based copolymer which has a narrower energy band gap of 1.61 eV (PCE = 4.2%).30 In addition, it is not much worse than that of another typical copolymer of BDT and DPP which has a further narrower energy band gap of 1.44 eV (PCE = 6.5%).12 It is necessary to note that no additive or thermal annealing was utilized for the current device fabrication, and this is advantageous for simplifying device fabrication and improving the repeatability of the device performance. Taking into account the relatively wide energy band gap of the donor materials, the photovoltaic performances of the Pa and Pc-based devices are rather fairish, indicating that pyrido[2,3,4,5-lmn]phenanthridine derivatives could be potential candidates for organic optoelectronics. The large energy band gap and efficient performance make the polymer Pa very suitable for tandem devices.
Conclusions
Three novel rigid and planar pyrido[2,3,4,5-lmn]phenanthridine derivatives of DAPPD, AOAPPO and DAOPP were successively synthesized and were utilized to construct the large band gap copolymers Pa, Pb and Pc for application as donor materials in BHJ PSCs. Among these polymers, the Pa-based device showed a moderate PCE of 4.54% in an inverted device architecture under the illumination of AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. The results indicated that the symmetrical DAPPD and DAOPP could be used as potential building blocks of optoelectronic materials for application in BHJ PSCs and organic thin-film transistors.
