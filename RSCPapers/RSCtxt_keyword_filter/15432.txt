Broader context
Exploring novel approaches to produce efficient, low-cost solar cells has attracted great academic and industrial interest due to the urgent need for renewable energy sources and the problem of global climate changes. Among the various traditional photovoltaic technologies, for instance crystal silicon and thin film solar cells, and emerging photovoltaic technologies, for instance dye-sensitized, organic, inorganic, and organic/inorganic hybrid solar cells, bulk-heterojunction solar cells based on conjugated polymers and semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) exhibit huge potential by combining the advantages of polymers and NCs, in particular the solution processability of polymer semiconductors and the high electron mobility of inorganic NCs. In this communication, we fabricated a polymer/NC bulk heterojunction solar cell using environmentally friendly water-soluble poly(p-phenylenevinylene) (PPV) and CdTe NCs. Specifically, we show how to achieve efficient polymer/NC solar cells by a simple annealing process. This work provides a facile and feasible protocol by processing devices from water-soluble conjugated polymers and NCs, and might open the door for the production of photovoltaic devices in green way.

Exploring novel approaches to produce efficient, low-cost solar cells has attracted great academic and industrial interest due to the urgent need for renewable energy sources and the problem of global climate changes. As an emerging photovoltaic technology, bulk-heterojunction solar cells based on conjugated polymers and semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) exhibit huge potential by combining the advantages of polymers and NCs, in particular the solution processability of polymer semiconductors and the high electron mobility of inorganic NCs.1,2 This strategy leads to the facile and feasible fabrication of photovoltaic devices in large area, at low cost, and with improved efficiency.2–14 Ever since Huynh, et al. reported the first efficient polymer/NC bulk heterojunction solar cells,3 a wide variety of NCs have been examined for fabricating polymer/NC hybrid solar cells, such as CdSe,3,4TiO2,5ZnO,6,7 PbS,8PbSe,9 and the performances of hybrid solar cells have been reported to keep on increasing.
In all reports, the material preparation and device fabrication are based on organic solvents, which typically include chloroform, chlorobenzene, toluene, etc. The organic solvents need careful handling and personal protective equipment and will inevitably give rise to environmental pollution. Thus, novel materials and processing protocols are welcome for producing clean energy via clean approaches. In recent years, water-soluble materials have attracted considerable attention because they are green and environmentally friendly. Moreover, life cycle analysis has shown that organic solvents have much higher embedded energy than water does.10,11 Using water-soluble materials for solar cells has been investigated by several groups, although the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is still less satisfactory than it is expected to be.10–14 For example, Qiao and McLeskey, Jr. prepared bilayer solar cells with a PCE of 0.13% utilizing water-soluble polythiophene and TiO2.12 Very recently, using a water processable polymer and fullerene, Søndergaard and Krebs demonstrated bulk heterojunction solar cells with an efficiency of 0.70%.14 In this scenario, the fabrication of solar cells using water as the solvent and completely from aqueous materials is closest to this goal.

        CdTe is suited to photovoltaics, and its bulk zinc blend crystal is reported to have a high electron mobility of up to 1050 cm2 V−1s−1.15 As an alternative approach for synthesizing high quality NCs, CdTe NCs can be synthesized in aqueous media, simultaneously leading to many advantages, such as cheaper, more reproducible, and less toxic syntheses.16 Although aqueous CdTe NCs have been widely applied in biological labeling,17 sensors,18 electroluminescence devices,19etc, their application in polymer/NC hybrid photovoltaic devices has not been reported. It is limited by the following points: first, both the conjugated polymer and NCs should be processed in water; second, proper surface modification of the NCs is required to improve the compatibility with the polymer; and third, efficient charge transport in the hybrid active layer is required.
On the basis of the recent state-of-the-art synthesis of aqueous CdTe NCs,16 in this communication, we demonstrate the fabrication of polymer/NC hybrid solar cells completely from aqueous materials. As shown in Fig. 1a, the donor material is poly(p-phenylenevinylene) (PPV) (see ESI,† Scheme S1), a representative conjugated polymer. The PPV precursor is soluble in water, permitting the device to be processed in aqueous solution.20,21 A transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image and the schematic structure of CdTe NCs capped by 2-mercaptoethylamine (MA), which are used as acceptors, are shown in Fig. 1b.22–24 The average size of CdTe NCs is 2.8 nm. Both CdTe NCs and PPV possess high charge mobilities and are expected to enhance the performance of solar cells.25 Furthermore, aqueous CdTe NCs are capped by small molecule ligands of MA, so no ligand exchange is required before device fabrication. Thus, the fabrication process is operated in air, making this approach a facile alternative for solar cell fabrication.

A schematic energy diagram illustrated the staggered band alignment of this prototypical donor–acceptor pair (Fig. 1c). From ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of PPV and the valence band edge of CdTe NCs were found to be 5.1 and 6.1 eV, respectively. Using these values, and the optical bandgap from UV-vis absorption spectra, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of PPV and the conduction band edge of CdTe NCs were calculated to be 2.7 and 4.4 eV, respectively.
An annealing treatment at 320 °C for 60 min was conducted to enhance the performance of the devices. On the one aspect, the PPV precursor underwent condensation polymerization to produce polymers with high molecular weights. On the other aspect, the water and the ligand of MA were removed and volatilized quickly (see ESI,† Fig. S1). IR spectra (Fig. 1d) showed an obvious reduction in the intensities of the N–H vibration at 3432 cm−1 (symmetric) and C–N stretching at 1607, 1382, 1322, 1264, and 918 cm−1, which are the signatures of MA. The new peaks at 1512, 1418, 1330 (C–C ring stretching), 1100 (C–H in-plane bending), and 960 cm−1 (trans-vinylene C–H out of plane bending) after annealing were attributed to PPV. These confirmed the MA elimination and PPV formation. To quantitatively verify the change in composition of the MA-capped CdTe NCs, pure NC film was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (see ESI,† Fig. S2). The XPS spectra showed the presence of S, C, N, O, Cd and Te. The atomic ratio of these elements before annealing was 0.673:6.533:0.546:4.95:1:0.512, and changed into 0.283:2.84:0.103:0.149:1:0.511 after annealing. It revealed that the amounts of Cd and Te remained constant, whereas the amounts of S and N respectively decreased to 42 and 18% of the original contents.

Fig. 2a and b presented the UV-vis absorption spectra of PPV:CdTe films with increasing CdTe concentration. Before annealing, the PPV precursor showed an absorption peak at 328 nm. The peak at 518 nm was assigned to the 1s–1s excitonic transition of CdTe NCs, and the peak intensity increased with the increase in CdTe concentration (Fig. 2a). After annealing at 320 °C, the absorption peak of PPV exhibited a 100 nm redshift, revealing the increased conjugation length of PPV (Fig. 2b).20 Meanwhile, the absorption peak of CdTe NCs disappeared completely. Correspondingly, the apparent color of the composite films turned from wine to dark yellow. These meant a size and/or surface structural variation of the NCs might occur after the annealing treatment.26Fig. 2c and d showed the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of PPV:CdTe films with different CdTe concentrations. The feature shifts observed in the absorption spectra were also observed in the PL spectra. Before annealing, the PPV precursor presented an emission peak at 475 nm, which shifted to 553 nm after annealing because of the increase in PPV conjugation length. CdTe NCs possessed a PL emission at 563 nm, which disappeared completely after annealing. This resulted from the removal of MA and/or the size increase of the NCs, in agreement with the observations from the absorption spectra. Note that the PPV precursor exhibited a broad PL emission, which was blue shifted by 4 nm after blending with CdTe NCs (Fig. 2c). This shift was attributed to the weakening of intermolecular force between PPV chains after introducing CdTe NCs. With the increase in CdTe concentration, the PL intensity of the PPV precursor decreased and disappeared completely when CdTe concentration was above 10 mg ml−1, indicating that efficient electron transfer from PPV to CdTe occurred.3 When the concentration of CdTe increased to 30 mg ml−1, the PL of CdTe was visible, and the intensity continued to increase with the increase in CdTe concentration.

Accordingly, photovoltaic devices were fabricated using spin-coated PPV:CdTe composite films as the photoactive layer. Without annealing treatment, none of the devices showed photovoltaic properties. The strongly bound MA on CdTe NCs was believed to be responsible for the charge-trapping states between PPV and the NCs. After the annealing treatment, the devices exhibited an apparently enhanced photo-generated current. The current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of PPV:CdTe solar cells in the dark and under illumination of AM1.5 global conditions (100 mW cm−2) were shown in Fig. 3. The best performance was obtained with a CdTe concentration of 30 mg ml−1, a PPV concentration of 1.8 mg ml−1, and an active layer thickness of 80 nm (Fig. 3a). The performances of solar cells with different structures were shown in Fig. 3b. The cell with a structure of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylene dioxylene thiophene):poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS)/PPV:CdTe/Al showed a short circuit-current (Jsc) of 9.31 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.50 V, a filled factor (FF) of 0.39, and, consequently, a PCE of 1.82% (see Table 1). The high current density was attributed to the high electron mobility of crystal CdTe,27 as well as the nano-scale structure of CdTe and the PPV phase. For the cells without a PEDOT:PSS layer, the Jsc was up to 12.31 mA cm−2. However, the FF was 0.30 and the Voc was 0.36 V. This result agreed with the previous reports and confirmed that the PEDOT:PSS layer played dual roles:26 on the one side, the PEDOT:PSS layer improved the Voc and FF by increasing the work function from 4.7 (ITO) to 5.0 eV (PEDOT:PSS),28 and ameliorating the charge carrier losses at the electrodes;29 on the other side, the enhanced series resistance (Rs) due to the PEDOT:PSS layer led to the decreased Jsc.30

For the cells with a 30 nm ZnO layer as an optical spacer and hole blocker,31 an improved PCE of up to 2.14% was further achieved. The PCE value was over 40 times that of its counterpart fabricated in organic solvents.32 The solar cells with a ZnO layer showed an apparent increase in shunt resistance (Rsh) and a decrease in Rs, hence leading to the improved FF and Jsc. Under dark condition, the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PPV:CdTe/ZnO/Al cells exhibited optimized rectifying semiconductor diode characteristics, i.e. a rectification ratio above 160 at ±1.0 V, which was much higher than that of cells with other structures (Fig. 3c).
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) for an optimized solar cell was shown in Fig. 3d. It was clear that the solar cell presented a photo response which covered a wide range, from 330 to 800 nm, and the EQE curve followed the absorption spectrum of the active layer (Fig. 2b). A comparison of the EQE spectrum with the absorption spectrum showed that both PPV and CdTe NCs contributed to light harvesting and photocurrent generation. The EQE below 500 nm was attributed to both PPV and CdTe, with a peak value of 55.2%, whereas the EQE above 500 nm was mainly attributed to CdTe.
The surface topography of PPV:CdTe films before and after spin-coating with a ZnO layer was examined using the atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 4a and b). For the PPV:CdTe film, the surface was rough, with a root mean square (RMS) value of 11.1 nm. In comparison, the RMS value decreased to 3.3 nm after spin-coating with ZnO, suggesting that the ZnO layer could effectively avoid the occurrence of pinholes, which in turn decreased the leak current and improved the Rsh.6 Under scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. 4c), the composite film was composed of closely stacked CdTe NCs, which was consistent with the rough morphology of the AFM image. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 4d) image showed that the average diameter of the CdTe NCs increased to 20 nm, which was consistent with the aforementioned spectroscopic analysis and confirmed that the NCs kept on growing in the films during the annealing treatment.33 Besides this, CdTe NCs connected with the neighboring NCs to form a percolated network, ensuring a high mobility of charge carrier transport towards the electrodes with reduced recombination. The network structure strongly depended on the ratio of blended PPV and CdTe. When the concentration of CdTe was lower than 30 mg ml−1, the network was not perfect, which might explain the concentration-dependent PCE (Fig. 3a). Note that the concentration of PPV determined the viscosity of the mixtures, which in turn governed the thickness of the spin-coated films. To keep the thickness of active layer, the concentration of PPV should not be too low.

In conclusion, we demonstrated the fabrication of efficient, low-cost polymer/NC hybrid solar cells from aqueous materials, a PPV precursor and CdTe NCs. With a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PPV:CdTe/ZnO/Al, a PCE of 2.14% was achieved. The key points of the current approach were the adoption of high charge mobility materials and the formation of percolated networks that contributed to the high photogenerated current and efficiency. Combining the spin-coating method and annealing process, this work provided a facile and feasible protocol for processing solar cellsvia an enviromentally friendly route. The current approach might open the door for the production of photovoltaic devices from various water-soluble materials, which will soundly promote the industrial processing of novel solar cells.
