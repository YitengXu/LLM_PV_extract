    , Accepted 2nd May 2016First published on 3rd May 2016AbstractIn this work, we demonstrate for the first time the fabrication of niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5) nanotube powder using a simple electrochemical anodization method. During the anodization process, the anodic oxide can be continuously and spontaneously released into the electrolyte, and after collection a white powder was obtained. The powder mainly displayed nanotube morphology with the tube length in the range of about 50–100 nm and a diameter of about 20–30 nm. The as-prepared powder was amorphous, and after annealing the powder can be crystallized to the orthorhombic phase. Based on the preparation of the powder, a thick and high quality Nb2O5 film on the transparent conductive substrate was produced, and was further employed as the photoanode in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). A comparably high efficiency of 3.15% was obtained, with a large open-circuit voltage of 0.738 V, which is among the highest values ever reported for porous Nb2O5 film based DSSCs. Furthermore, the difference in electron behavior of the device as compared to a TiO2 counterpart was studied, which exhibited a significantly reduced recombination rate, beneficial to high efficiency DSSCs.
1. Introduction
The development of metal oxide nanostructures other than titanium dioxide (TiO2), such as zinc oxide (ZnO),1,2 tin dioxide (SnO2),3,4 and niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5)5–8 for solar energy conversion applications has been recently attracting significant research interest. A Nb2O5 film as a photoanode can provide (1) a higher conduction band energy level than the traditional TiO2 nanocrystals9–11 and thus in principle higher open circuit voltage and solar energy conversion efficiency in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs); (2) superior electron properties with smaller interfacial electron recombination,10 which is essential for liquid and solid-state DSSCs; and (3) better chemical stability. However, DSSCs based on various Nb2O5 nanostructures reported thus far have shown poor performances.12 A power conversion efficiency of 2.97% was obtained for DSSCs based on Nb2O5 mesoporous spheres through a solvothermal process.13 The Nb2O5 nanoforest photoanode fabricated by pulsed laser deposition showed 2.41% conversion efficiency.14 By using electrochemical anodization, a promising method for the synthesis of porous metal oxides, various well-defined Nb2O5 nanostructures on Nb foils have been produced and employed as the photoanode materials in DSSCs. For example, by using thin nanoporous Nb2O5 networks as the electrode,15 4.1% efficiency was achieved with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 10.00 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.70 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 58.5%. For anodic Nb2O5 nanochannels, when utilized in DSSCs, a high efficiency of about 4.5% has been reported,16 but the fill factor and the open-circuit voltage were poor, with the values of 39.8% and 0.639 V, respectively. To date, the highest efficiency of about 6% has been reported with 11.2 μm thick hydrothermally grown Nb2O5 nanorods.17
For anodized Nb2O5 nanostructures, the as-prepared niobium oxides normally tightly adhered to the Nb foil substrate. When employing the oxides for DSSCs, the main problem is that the solar cells based on foil should use the undesired back-side solar cell configuration, which would lead to much energy loss and limited solar cell performance.18 As has been introduced above, DSSCs based on nanoporous networks and nanochannel structures both used the back-side configuration.15,16 The anodized Nb oxides free from the metal foil substrate, that is, films coated on transparent conductive oxide (TCO) substrates, can improve light absorption in DSSCs to obtain better performance and will also be more convenient to be utilized in other broad applications. The strategies for TCO substrates with a front-side configuration include direct anodization of sputtered or evaporated Nb films, synthesis and transfer of free-standing membranes, and fabrication of oxide powders. By producing oxide powders,19 one can simply disperse and coat them onto the TCO substrate to prepare porous oxide films, forming photoanodes for front-side illuminated devices. This strategy is advantageous because it is also suitable for large-scale production and the film area and thickness can be easily tuned.
Herein, we have performed a simple electrochemical anodization method to directly synthesize Nb2O5 nanotube powder. The morphology, nanostructure, and crystal phase of the obtained powder were characterized in detail. After annealing to induce crystallization, the powder was used as a photoanode material in front-side illuminated DSSCs. Its photoelectric performance and electron properties when applied in DSSCs have been evaluated.
2. Experimental
Preparation of niobium oxide nanotube powder
Niobium oxide powder was prepared by direct electrochemical anodization of niobium metal foil (99.7% purity, J&K Chemical). The electrolyte was 0.74 g NH4F and 0.5 g deionized (DI) water added in 50 mL glycerol, and it was mixed by stirring for 2 h before use. The anodization process was performed at a constant voltage of 90 V at room temperature (∼25 °C), until the foil was almost completely consumed (before the foil was broken at the electrolyte/air interface). The powder was collected from the anodization electrolyte by centrifugation, washed with ethanol and water 3 times, respectively, and then dried at 120 °C overnight in a drying oven. The powder product was further ultrasonicated in ethanol for 30 min to disperse the powder. To crystallize the powder, it was annealed at 550 °C in air for 4 h (2 °C min−1). The morphology of the powder was investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi SU8020). The crystal structures were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku 9KW SmartLab) using Cu Kα (wavelength 1.54 Å) radiation from 20–80°. A transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai F30) operating at 300 kV was used to investigate the nanostructure of the powder. A surface characterization analyzer (Micromeritics, 3Flex) was used to measure the surface area of the prepared powder.
DSSC assembly and characterization
To investigate the application of this Nb2O5 powder in DSSCs with a front-side illumination configuration, Nb2O5 nanotube photoanodes were synthesized. The powder (0.2 g), terpineol, isopropanol, and n-butyl alcohol with a mass ratio of 1:4:1:4 were mixed, stirred, and ultrasonicated to make a homogeneous and viscous Nb2O5 paste. The as-prepared paste was coated onto the F-doped SnO2 (FTO) glass substrate (20 Ω sq−1, 2.3 mm thick, NSG) using a doctor-blade technique. The film thickness was 10 μm and the active area was 0.5 × 0.5 cm2. The electrode was annealed again at 550 °C in air for 2 h to remove any organic residues, and then sensitized with N3 dye (0.3 mM in ethanol, Solaronix) for 2 days at room temperature (∼25 °C). The solar cell assembly and sealing process was the same as reported elsewhere.19 For comparison, the TiO2 electrode was prepared using a commercial paste (18NR-T, Dyesol). Intensity modulated photovoltage and photocurrent spectra (IMVS and IMPS) were measured at different light intensities at a wavelength of 470 nm using an electrochemical workstation (Solartron), with ±10% light intensity modulation and the frequency range from 0.005 to 1 kHz. The open-circuit photovoltage decay (OCVD) measurements were also conducted using the electrochemical workstation. The amount of dye adsorbed was compared by desorbing the dye molecules in 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution and measuring the absorbance using a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu). A 3A solar simulator (450 W, Model 94023A, Newport-Oriel Instruments) was used to provide full sunlight (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2).
3. Results and discussion
Characterization of niobium pentoxide nanotube powder
The fabrication process of the Nb2O5 nanotube powder is shown in the scheme (Fig. 1a). The field assisted oxidation initiated the formation of niobium oxide on the metal surface. During the process the interfacial barrier layer between the niobium oxide and the metal foil substrate was gradually dissolved and the oxides were released into the electrolyte. And then the formation of niobium oxide through oxidation can be continued. The above processes were repeated, resulting in the periodic formation and release of niobium oxide into the electrolyte. By separating the oxides from the electrolyte, a white oxide powder can be obtained (Fig. 1b), followed by annealing at 550 °C to induce crystallization. The morphology of the synthesized powder was characterized by SEM, as shown in Fig. 1c. By controlling the reaction conditions, dispersed one-dimensional nanotubes were observed, free from the metal substrate. The nanotubes are uniformly distributed, with tube lengths in the range of ∼50–100 nm and diameters of ∼20–30 nm. This tube structure of the powder is quite different from the arrays or bundles of Nb2O5 nanostructures formed by previous electrochemical anodization.20,21

The nanotube morphology of the powder was further studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). From the TEM images (Fig. 2a and b), the as-prepared samples showed no obvious tube morphology. After annealing, the nanotube structure can be clearly observed (Fig. 2c and d), and the tube lengths and diameters are in the range of about 50–100 and 20–30 nm, respectively, in good agreement with the SEM results. Due to the loosely packed nanostructure, the specific internal surface area of the anodic nanotube powder could be much larger than those of the closely packed ones. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurement showed that the surface area of Nb2O5 powder before and after annealing was 136.9 and 51.3 m2 g−1, respectively, which is much higher than the surface areas of previously fabricated Nb2O5 nanostructures by electrochemical anodization (e.g., ∼14 m2 g−1 for anodic nanopores).22 In principle, the network of the nanotubes can provide direct electron pathways and reduce the electron recombination when applied as the photoanode in DSSCs, beneficial to high efficiency solar cells.

The crystal structures before and after annealing were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The as-prepared nanotube oxide powder after drying appeared to be amorphous without characteristic sharp diffraction peaks (Fig. 3a). As reported previously, the samples synthesized by electrochemical anodization usually have amorphous crystal structures before annealing.15,16 For DSSC application, the powder was annealed at 550 °C to induce crystallization and to remove any organic residues. After annealing, a highly crystallized powder was obtained with the main diffraction peaks at 22.7°, 28.6°, 36.7°, 46.2°, 50.7°, 55.3°, 58.8°, 64.0°, 71.0° and 78.3° (2-theta). These peaks can be indexed to the orthorhombic phase of Nb2O5 (JCPDS#27-1003).23 The crystal structure of the annealed Nb2O5 nanotube powder was further identified by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images (Fig. 3b). The highly resolved lattice fringes with spacing d = 0.315 nm was observed, corresponding to the (180) plane of the orthorhombic phase,24 consistent with the XRD results.

Application as a photoanode in dye-sensitized solar cells
As one of the promising photoanode materials, the nanopowder after annealing was investigated for the assembly of DSSCs. Thin films of Nb2O5 were fabricated by making the powder into a viscous paste and coating it onto a FTO glass substrate using a doctor blade method (see the Experimental section for details), achieving the transparent photoanode for front-side illuminated solar cells. The photographs of the as-prepared photoanode and that after dye infiltration based on the Nb2O5 powder are shown in the inset of Fig. 4, showing a uniform red color after the dye infiltration. For comparison, the commonly used TiO2 nanoparticle film photoanode was also prepared. Both of these films were of the same average thickness of 10 μm. The photoelectric performances of DSSCs based on Nb2O5 and TiO2 photoanodes are shown in Fig. 4. The Nb2O5 solar cell showed an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.738 V and the TiO2 solar cell showed a VOC of 0.706 V. The Nb2O5 solar cell provided an ∼30 mV increase of VOC compared to the TiO2 one, and the value is among the highest values ever reported for Nb2O5 based DSSCs (such as 0.59 V,25 0.63 V,26 0.70 V,15 and 0.74 V17).

Although the Nb2O5 cell showed a higher VOC, a reduction in photocurrent was observed. The short-circuit current density (JSC) was 6.234 mA cm−2 for the Nb2O5 cell and 11.025 mA cm−2 for the TiO2 cell. As the fill factor (FF) was almost the same (68.3% for Nb2O5 and 69.9% for TiO2), the photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) of the Nb2O5 cell was 3.15%, lower than that of the TiO2 cell (5.45%). The detailed parameters are listed in Table 1. We have investigated the dye loading of the Nb2O5 and TiO2 photoanodes. The loading amount of N3 dye was found to be 0.83 × 10−7 mol cm−2 (or the dye molecule number is 0.5 × 1020 cm−3) for Nb2O5 and 1.63 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for TiO2. The lower dye loading, which was probably due to the mismatch between Nb2O5 and dye,13 caused the decrease of light harvesting, photocurrent and thus cell efficiency. Thus the further improvement of the efficiency of Nb2O5 cells, e.g., by surface functionalization or structure modification, deserves further exploration.

The electron transport and recombination properties of the Nb2O5 and TiO2 solar cells were studied using IMVS and IMPS under different illumination conditions.27,28 Both the effective electron lifetime (τn) and transport time (τc) values reduced exponentially upon increasing the voltage as the electron concentration increased (Fig. 5). In the entire voltage range, the lifetime value was much higher in nanotubular Nb2O5 than in TiO2. For example, at the open-circuit voltage of ∼0.65 V, the Nb2O5 electrode exhibited >10 times larger lifetime (79.8 ms) than the TiO2 one (7.5 ms). This implies a reduction in the electron recombination rate with the oxidized species for the Nb2O5 cell with respect to the TiO2 cell, probably due to less charge transfer and recombination centers existing in the Nb2O5 nanotube powder. The slow electron recombination behavior is beneficial to various applications, e.g., solid-state sensitized and heterostructured solar cells. It is also found that the electron transport time of Nb2O5 was longer than that of TiO2 (0.021 s vs. 0.003 s), which was probably due to the lower electronic conductivity of Nb2O5.15 As a result of the long lifetime, the charge collection efficiency, calculated as ηcc = 1 − τc/τn, is 73.7% for the Nb2O5 cell, higher than that of the TiO2 cell (60.0%).

The longer electron lifetime and the lower electron recombination rate in the Nb2O5 cell were further confirmed by open-circuit photovoltage decay (OCVD) measurements. The voltage decay behaviors of Nb2O5 and TiO2 based DSSCs are shown in Fig. 6. The decay rate of the Nb2O5 electrode is obviously lower than the TiO2 one, indicating slower interfacial electron recombination of Nb2O5 than TiO2. The electron lifetime as a function of VOC can be calculated using eqn (1).29 (1)where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature (=298 K), and e is the electron charge. The result is shown in the inset of Fig. 6. From the OCVD results, the lifetimes of both Nb2O5 and TiO2 solar cells showed an exponential dependence on VOC. The lifetimes of the Nb2O5 cell were more than one order of magnitude higher as compared with the TiO2 cell at the same VOC (e.g., 101.8 ms vs. 4.4 ms at ∼0.63 V), which is consistent with the IMVS measurement.

4. Conclusions
In this work, we have successfully synthesized niobium pentoxide nanotube powder using a simple electrochemical anodization method. The anodically grown niobium oxides can be continuously and spontaneously released from the Nb substrate during the anodization, which were then collected to obtain the oxide powder. The powder showed well-defined nanotube morphology, with uniform tube lengths and diameters and also a large specific surface area. The as-formed powder was amorphous and after annealing an orthorhombic crystal phase was obtained. By utilizing the nanotube powder, we developed the oxide films on a transparent conductive substrate as the photoanode for front-side illuminated dye-sensitized solar cells. The results indicated that the niobium pentoxide solar cell had a high open-circuit voltage and greatly extended electron lifetimes as compared to the titanium dioxide counterpart, indicating much slower electron recombination. The strategy of the nanotube powder synthesis is preferable for large-scale production, which may have various potential applications.
