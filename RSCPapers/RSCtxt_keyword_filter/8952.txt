    , Accepted 6th June 2016First published on 13th June 2016AbstractGraphene/silicon (Gr/Si) solar cells have attracted extensive research interest for their potentials in low-cost photovoltaic applications. However, the performance of Gr/Si solar cells is still limited by the working principles of Schottky junctions. This work developed a new type of Gr/Si solar cell with a self-generated quasi p–n junction. In such devices, a strong upward band bending is caused by considerable charge transfer from Si, resulting in a p-type layer being formed at the near-surface of the n-type Si substrate. They have similar rectification characteristics to conventional p–n junctions, and are even superior due to the absence of the “dead layer”. Here, a thermal evaporation deposited tungsten tri-oxide (WO3) interlayer was inserted between the Gr and Si to form the quasi p–n junction Gr/Si solar cells, achieving a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.59% for Gr/Si solar cells without chemical doping. The concept of a self-generated quasi p–n junction offers a possibility to overcome the limitations affecting the development of Gr/Si solar cells, and shows a promising future for diverse transition metal oxides for the fabrication of low-cost, high-efficiency and stable photovoltaic devices in the future.
1. Introduction
Although silicon (Si)-based p–n junction solar cells are getting closer and closer to reaching their theoretical efficiency limit,1 the high cost and highly toxic p–n junction forming process severely hinder the future application of Si-based solar cells. In the last few years, graphene/silicon (Gr/Si) solar cells have attracted extensive research interest due to the fascinating properties of Gr, such as high carrier mobility, high optical transmittance and roll-to-roll synthesis.2,3 Gr/Si solar cells are fabricated via a simple wet transfer technique, which can drastically reduce the cost for device fabrication.4–6 In these devices, Gr films not only serve as a transparent electrode, but also form Schottky junctions with the Si substrates for the separation of the photo-generated carriers.7,8
Since the first Gr/Si solar cell was put forward by Wu et al. in 2010,8 strategies including chemical doping,9–11 antireflection12,13 and interface engineering14,15 have been used to improve the device performance. Interface engineering is believed to be one of the most important factors, as a poor quality of the interface is usually responsible for severe degradation in the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF).15,16 Most researchers have used insulating oxide interlayers like SiOx (native silicon oxide),16 aluminium oxide (Al2O3)17 and graphene oxide (GO)7,18 to reduce surface recombination and enhance the performance of Gr/Si solar cells. However, the performance, especially the VOC of Gr/Si solar cells is still limited by the working principles of Schottky junctions including Fermi-level-pinning and surface defect states at the Si surface.19,20 Here, we would like to demonstrate an evolutionary type of Gr/Si solar cell with a self-generated quasi p–n junction inside. In this case, after the device fabrication process, a strong upward band bending occurs at the near-surface of the n-type Si, where electrons are depleted and holes are accumulated. As a result, a thin p-type (inversion) layer and hence a quasi p–n junction form. The rectification characteristic of such junctions is governed by minority carrier diffusion currents, behaving quite similar to conventional p–n junctions. Moreover, quasi p–n junction solar cells are advantageous as a consequence of the elimination of the “dead layer” that exists in conventional p–n junction solar cells, which should be able to overcome the limitations affecting the development of Gr/Si solar cells.21
To form the self-generated quasi p–n junction, charge transfer from Si or Fermi-level offset with considerably high intensity is required. Some earlier works have deposited silicon monoxide (SiO), Al2O3 and silicon dioxide (SiO2) on p- or n-type Si, resulting in the generation of an inversion layer.22,23 The thickness of such oxide layers should be large enough to generate fixed charges with high density. However, currents are more or less blocked by such thick oxide layers. Others have studied some metals with appropriate work functions, such as magnesium (Mg), to generate extensive charge transfer from Si. This method is also not favored for solar cells since the metal layers would shadow the incident light.21 In this work, a facile thermally evaporated tungsten tri-oxide (WO3) thin film was selected as the interlayer between Gr and Si due to its unique deep-lying Fermi-level and its ease of fabrication.24 WO3 interlayers have been extensively studied as hole-transporting layers (HTL) or hole-extracting layers (HEL) in organic photovoltaics25 and organic light emitting devices.26,27 In these, the deep-lying Fermi-level of WO3 interlayers generates a band bending between organic semiconductors and anodes for promoting the hole extraction. In this case, considerable charge transfer from Si occurs, which is caused by the large Fermi-level offset between the n-type Si and WO3, generating a strong band bending. Consequently, self-generation of a quasi p–n junction was achieved. The WO3 interlayer also serves as a HEL which facilitates the unobstructed transport of holes. Meanwhile, the large band gap of WO3 allows almost all the incident light to pass through. As a result, a high efficiency of 10.59% was achieved. This is the first time that a chemical-doping-free Gr/Si solar cell with an efficiency over 10% is reported. Note that the chemical doping technique of Gr using HNO3 or AuCl3 is commonly employed to obtain Gr/Si solar cells with high efficiency, but which lack stability.17,28 These findings pave a new way for the future design and optimization of Gr/Si solar cells. We note that various transition metal oxide (TMO) thin films with high work-functions or fixed charges could be fabricated utilizing feasible solution-processed or thermal evaporation methods.29–31 Such TMO interlayers might be alternated to form quasi p–n junction solar cells, which can hopefully be applied in other Si-based hybrid solar cells, being beneficial for the fabrication of low-cost, high-efficiency and stable photovoltaic devices in the near future.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Growth and characterization of monolayer Gr films
Large-area monolayer Gr films were grown on a copper foil by a low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) method at 1000 °C using CH4 (20 sccm) as carbon source and H2 (40 sccm) as reducing gas. A well-defined polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) assisted process was used for Gr transfer,32 which is briefly described below. Firstly, the Gr film was spin-coated with PMMA in ethyl lactate, followed by drying on a hot plate at 150 °C for 15 min. Then, the Gr film on the backside of the Cu foil was etched away by an ultraviolet ozone cleaning process for 10 min. Next, the underlying Cu foil was etched by aqueous ammonium persulfate ((NH4)2S2O8, 99%) solution (1 M). The resultant Gr films were cleaned by deionized water several times. After being transferred onto a SiO2 film on silicon, the quality of the Gr films was analysed by a Raman system (SENTERRA Raman microscope, Bruker) and the sheet resistances of Gr films were measured by a four probe method.
2.2 Fabrication of Gr/Si solar cells with a WO3 interlayer
N-type 〈100〉 Czochralski Si samples with a resistivity of 1–3 Ω cm and a thickness of 400 μm were employed to construct Gr/Si solar cells. After the Si samples were soaked in a dilute HF solution for several minutes, they were exposed to air for about 2 hours to grow a fresh native oxide layer. WO3 films with various thickness and 130 nm-thick silver electrodes were deposited successively onto the Si samples by thermal evaporation. Then, the monolayer Gr film coated with PMMA was transferred onto the as-deposited WO3 film followed by a 120 °C/15 min annealing treatment in a N2 atmosphere. The active area of the devices determined by the edge of the Ag electrode was 0.09 cm2 and the residue part (including the Ag electrode and the substrate without Gr coating) was completely covered by black tape. The back contacts of all the devices were fabricated by scratching an In–Ga eutectic alloy.
2.3 Characterization and electrical measurements
The thickness of the WO3 layer was determined by a film thickness meter (INFICON, SQM-160). The morphology of the Si/WO3 interface was examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Hitachi HT7700). The performances of devices were measured by a Keithley 2400 source meter and a solar simulator (94022A, Newport®) under AM 1.5G conditions at an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2, calibrated by a standard Si solar cell (PVM937, Newport®). Capacity–voltage (C–V) curves were measured by a Keithley 5900 source meter. The minority carrier lifetime was measured by microwave photo-induced conductance decay technique (MW-PCD, SemiLab).
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 presents a schematic band diagram of the Gr/Si solar cells with a WO3 interlayer. A Kelvin probe was used to measure the work function of Gr, n-Si and WO3, and the corresponding values are 4.7 eV, 4.3 eV and 5.3 eV, respectively (see Fig. S1†). The work functions of Gr and n-Si are in good agreement with the literature.8,33 Typical values for the work function of WO3 thin films in the range of 5.3–5.6 eV have been reported by some groups.25,31 Our value is relatively low, as compared with some earlier works (∼6.7 eV measured by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy under a high vacuum).26 Such discrepancy is mainly ascribed to the absorption of O2 and carbon contaminants from the open air.30 When WO3 thin films come into contact with n-type Si, the large offset between the Fermi-levels of WO3 and Si can cause a considerable amount of charge transfer from Si, resulting in a strong upward band bending at the WO3/Si interface. Thus, the built-in field (Vbi) of the Gr/Si solar cells is enhanced by the insertion of the WO3 interlayer. Under illumination, the photon-generated hole–electron pairs are separated by the strong built-in field. The WO3/Si interface acts as an electron-limiting barrier, pushing electrons away from the anode and pulling holes toward the anode.34 Therefore, the WO3 interlayer not only promotes hole extraction, but also suppress carrier recombination in the Gr/Si solar cells. More interestingly, the strong charge transfer causes depletion of electrons and accumulation of holes at the very surface of the Si; when the population of holes near the surface exceeds that of electrons in the bulk, this thin layer is inverted into a p-type one, which can also be achieved by extensive fixed charge in other cases.22,23 Consequently, the photo-generated carriers would be separated near the interface of the self-generated p-type thin layer and the underlying n-type substrate. Therefore, the working mechanism of these Gr/Si solar cells changes from that of a conventional Schottky junction into a self-generated quasi p–n junction. In this case, the performance of the solar cells would become less vulnerable to surface states since the site for carrier separation has moved from the surface into the high-purity, defect-less Si substrate.20 Meanwhile, the quasi p–n junctions behave with similar rectification characteristics to conventional p–n junctions which are dominated by a minority carrier diffusion current.35,36 Furthermore, superior behavior of the quasi p–n junctions is expected due to the elimination of the “dead layer” (the dead layer is a highly-doped defective region in conventional Si-based p–n junction solar cells included to achieve a good ohmic top contact, but which causes considerable carrier recombination).21 The purpose of this work is to elucidate if the quasi p–n junction model is dominant for Gr/Si solar cells with a WO3 interlayer, which could be useful for the design and optimization of high efficiency Si-based hybrid solar cells.
 Fig. 1  Schematic band structure of the Gr/Si solar cell with a WO3 interlayer. 
Gr/Si solar cells with a WO3 interlayer were fabricated following the experimental section. Fig. 2(a) and (b) display the schematic structure and a photograph of the device. The sectional morphology of the WO3/Si interface is illustrated by the TEM micrograph shown in Fig. 2(c), in which the thermal evaporation deposited WO3 thin film covers the Si substrate uniformly. Such a smooth morphology of the WO3 thin film ensures a homogeneous construction across the device. Fig. 2(d) and (e) show the surface morphology of Si before and after deposition of the WO3 thin film. The values of the root mean square (RMS) roughness (Rq) are 0.29 nm and 0.41 nm for the bare Si surface (Fig. 2(d)) and the WO3 coated Si surface (Fig. 2(e)), respectively. The introduction of the WO3 interlayer to the Gr/Si solar cells does not influence the surface morphology much. Thus, shunt paths and carrier recombination are not expected to increase. Fig. S2(a)† displays a typical Raman spectrum of our grown Gr film. The intensity ratio between the 2D peak and the G peak is about 2.2, which suggests that our Gr film is a monolayer. A very weak D peak at ∼1350 cm−1 associated with defects appears in the Raman spectrum, indicating that the Gr film is of high quality. Fig. S2(b)† shows the light transmittance spectrum of a monolayer Gr film on glass. A high transmittance of 96.3% at 550 nm is observed, which is important for allowing most of the incident photons to be absorbed by the Si substrates below. The sheet resistance of the Gr films is in the range of 300–800 Ω sq−1, measured by the four probe measurement. These characteristics indicate that the Gr film possesses excellent optoelectronic properties, and is suitable for the fabrication of Gr/Si solar cells.

To further understand the operating physics of the Gr/Si solar cells with a WO3 interlayer, the built-in field (Vbi) of the device was examined by a capacity–voltage (C–V) measurement. According to the discussion about the self-generated quasi p–n junction in the first paragraph of this section, Vbi is supposed to be large enough to generate a strong inversion layer near the surface of Si. Generally, the critical value of Vbi for this is described as follows: Vbi,cri = 2(EF − Ei)/q = 2kTln(ND/ni)/q(1)where EF and Ei represent the Fermi energy and intrinsic Fermi energy of Si, respectively; q is the elementary charge; ni the intrinsic carrier concentration of the silicon substrate; k the Boltzmann constant; T the temperature and ND is the dopant concentration of the Si substrate. For the 1–3 Ω cm Si used here, Vbi,cri is ∼0.7 V. This means that a quasi p–n junction could form in devices with Vbi exceeding 0.7 V. Fig. 3(a) shows the plot of 1/C2 as a function of voltage bias applied on the Gr/Si solar cells. According to the equation 1/C2 = 2(V − Vbi)/(qεND), the value of Vbi is obtained from the extrapolated value of 1/C2 to the abscissa, which is 0.85 and 0.52 V for Gr/Si solar cells with and without a WO3 interlayer, respectively. The Vbi of the solar cell with a WO3 interlayer is much larger than that of one without a WO3 interlayer. Therefore, we can judge that a strong inversion layer is formed in the Gr/Si solar cell with a WO3 interlayer, but this is not the case for the one without a WO3 interlayer. Meanwhile, a higher Vbi of a solar cell contributes to an improvement in VOC. Fig. 3(b) compares the J–V characteristics of Gr/Si solar cells with and without a WO3 interlayer in dark circumstances. The dark J–V characteristics are empirically expressed as: J = J0[exp(qV/nkT) − 1](2)where J0 is the saturation current density and n is the ideality factor. The ideality factor of a device can be determined by fitting the plot of ln(J)–V in its linear regime. The ideality factors are 1.2 and 1.8 for Gr/Si solar cells with and without a WO3 interlayer, respectively. These results indicate that the introduction of a WO3 interlayer effectively improves the J–V characteristics of the Gr/Si solar cells. Furthermore, the value of J0 for the device with a WO3 interlayer is 7.1 × 10−10 A cm−2, which is about 15-fold smaller than that of the conventional device, 3.1 × 10−8 A cm−2 indicating less recombination and improved junction quality for devices with a WO3 interlayer. Such improvements are related to the enhancement of the aforementioned built-in field which enables the diode to show stronger rectification characteristics.11 Since the VOC of solar cells is a function of J0 based on the relationship VOC = nkT/q × ln(JSC/J0),37VOC of Gr/Si solar cells with a WO3 interlayer will be higher than that of the conventional Gr/Si solar cells.

Fig. 4(a) shows the ideality factor of the Gr/Si solar cell with a WO3 interlayer as a function of temperature. The ideality factor of the device follows a linear relationship with temperature in the form of 1/n versus T. Such temperature dependent behavior has been widely observed in Si-based p–n junctions,37–40 non-Si-based p–n junctions41,42 and organic p–n junctions.43 It was first derived by Walter et al.44 from the SRH recombination model as follows:, 1/n = (1 + T/T*)/2(3)where T* is the characteristic temperature for energetic distributions of the traps.41 The reverse saturation current density, J0, can be further expressed as: J0 = J00exp(−Ea/nkT)(4)where J00 is the temperature independent pre-factor and Ea is the thermal energy barrier responsible for current rectification.40,41 According to eqn (4), the value of Ea can be extracted from the linear slope of n × lnJ0 ∼ 1/T,38,41,43 as shown in Fig. 4(b). A value of 1.1 eV is extracted as the thermal energy barrier responsible for current rectification. This value is exactly the same as the bandgap of Si in this temperature range, suggesting that the temperature dependent rectification characteristics originate from electrons and holes inside Si, and Si is the light-absorbing and carrier generation site in the Gr/Si solar cells with a WO3 interlayer. Such a methodology to extract the band gap of light absorbing materials has been frequently used in investigating various heterojunction solar cells.37,42,45 For organic/inorganic hybrid solar cells with ideality factors larger than 2, a specific dominant carrier generation/transport mechanism was assigned to recombination in space-charge regions (SCR).41,43 In general p–n junctions, according to the classical SRH model, the total forward current density, JF, can be written as the sum of the minority carrier diffusion current density (Jd) and the recombination current density (Jrg, thermal generation–recombination of carriers inside SCR),46 JF = Jd + Jrg(5-1) Jrg = Jrg0exp(qV/2kT)(5-2) Jd = Jd0exp(qV/kT)(5-3)where Jrg0 and Jd0 are the values calculated from Jrg and Jd extrapolated to zero bias. Note that Jd is significant when n is close to unity, while Jrg becomes dominant when n is close to 2. For near ideal diodes in this case, the forward J–V characteristics are fitted well with a single exponential as: JF = Jrg + Jd ≈ JF0exp(qV/nkT).(6)Differentiating eqn (6) with respect to V and meanwhile taking into account eqn (5), the ratio of Jrg over Jd with a variety of n is obtained as Jrg/Jd ≈ (n − 1)/(1 − 0.5n), yielding ∼67% of Jd with n equals 1.2 for our devices. Therefore, the dark forward current of Gr/Si solar cells with a WO3 interlayer is actually governed by Jd. Such minority carrier diffusion dominated transport behavior demonstrates the quasi p–n junction rectification mode for our device.

To further support the self-generation of the quasi p–n junction, a partial mapping of the effective lifetime for the Si sample was carried out as shown in Fig. 5, in which the left half is naked and the right half is coated by a WO3 film. Generally, the minority carrier lifetime of Si samples depends on both the surface and bulk recombination as follows: 1/τ = 1/τb + 1/τs(7)where τ is the measured carrier lifetime; τb is the bulk carrier lifetime and τs the surface carrier lifetime. Since the bulk carrier lifetime of a Si wafer is much higher than the surface carrier lifetime, the measured carrier lifetime actually reflects the surface recombination lifetime of minority carriers. It can be seen that the values of τs for the left half of the Si sample are in the range of 13–17 μs, and those for the right half of the Si sample are up to 52 μs. This indicates that the introduction of the WO3 film suppresses carrier recombination at the Si surface. Since no additional Si surface passivation was performed here, the only reason for the τs increase would be the self-generation of the quasi p–n junction near the surface of the Si. The self-generation of a p-type thin layer reduces the electron population near the surface of the n-type Si, which is beneficial for the decrease of the minority carrier (hole) recombination rate and hence the leakage current of the solar cells. Furthermore, the measured lifetime was compared with the theoretical value estimated from the forward-bias device characteristics with the diffusion-dominated p+–n junction model.46 In a first order approximation, for a p+–n junction JF0 is given by: (8)where Dp ≈ 12 cm2 s−1 is the diffusion coefficient of holes, ND the doping concentration of Si and τ is the effective lifetime. Using ni,Si = 1.07 × 1010 cm−3 and ND = 1.5 × 1015 cm−3, the effective lifetime is estimated to be ∼36 μs, which in good agreement with the measured value. All of these observed characteristics, that is, the strong built-in field, the small ideality factor, the long carrier lifetime and the diffusion-controlled transport, strongly demonstrate the self-generation of the quasi p–n junction is realized in the Gr/Si solar cells through a facile thermal evaporation deposition method, which is an encouraging result for future developments in device design of Si-based hybrid solar cells.

Fig. 6 demonstrates the improvements in photovoltaic performance of the quasi p–n junction solar cells. Firstly, J–V curves under illumination for three types of solar cell are compared in Fig. 6(a), in which device A is a WO3/Si solar cell; device B is a conventional Gr/Si solar cell and device C is a Gr/Si solar cell with a WO3 interlayer. The device schematics are shown in Fig. S3.† For the WO3/Si solar cell, due to the poor conductivity of the WO3 layer, only the holes generated close to the edge of the Ag electrodes could be collected, which translates into a weak photo-current of 0.07 mA cm−2 and a very low power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.01%. For the best Gr/Si solar cells without a WO3 layer, the open-circuit voltage (VOC), the short-circuit current density (JSC) and the fill factor (FF) are 383.61 mV, 26.75 mA cm−2 and 38.91%, respectively, yielding a PCE of 3.99%. After a WO3 layer is inserted between the Gr film and Si (device C), the performances of the solar cells are substantially improved (see details in Table S1†), which comes from increases of VOC, JSC and FF (Fig. 6(b)). As a result, a PCE up to 10.59% was achieved. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that an efficiency over 10% has been obtained for chemical-doping-free Gr/Si solar cells, which is also comparable with doped ones in the literature, as shown in Table S2.† In principle, the larger built-in field and the lower saturation current are responsible for the higher VOC; and the improvement of FF is associated with suppression of carrier recombination and stronger rectification. Fig. 6(c) compares the EQE spectra of Gr/Si solar cells with and without a WO3 interlayer. Two peaks reaching up to ∼90% are observed for the Gr/Si solar cell with a WO3 interlayer. Integrated JSC values were calculated from the EQE spectra, which are within 10% deviation of those measured by J–V curves. The integrated JSC increases from 25 mA cm−2 to 31 mA cm−2 in line with the JSC improvement from the J–V curves. The peak shapes and positions in the EQE spectrum, which are located at ∼440 nm and ∼740 nm, are in good agreement with the reflectance spectrum in Fig. S4.† It can be seen that an antireflection effect is caused by the WO3 interlayers and PMMA films on top of Gr, which has been reported previously.47 Please note that for the Gr/Si solar cells with a WO3 interlayer, the PMMA coating on top of the Gr films was left untreated, which aims to keep the PMMA coating as an antireflection coating. On the other hand, the PMMA removal process, which is either dipping in acetone28 or high temperature annealing,17 inevitably causes serious performance degradation (not only in JSC) of the Gr/WO3/Si solar cells, as summarized in Table S3.† All these results indicate that the introduction of the WO3 interlayer, especially the self-generation of the quasi p–n junction, greatly improves the photovoltaic performances of Gr/Si solar cells by about three times on average. Fig. 6(d) displays the J–V characteristics of Gr/WO3/Si solar cells with various thicknesses of the WO3 interlayer under illumination. Fig. 7 shows the photovoltaic parameters as a function of WO3 thickness (five parallel solar cells for each thickness). When the thickness of the WO3 interlayer is low (5–10 nm), a strong inversion layer is not fully formed, which causes a low VOC and FF of the solar cells. Then, VOC and FF increase with WO3 thickness and plateau for thick WO3 interlayers (15–35 nm) as a result of the self-generation of the quasi p–n junction. The limiting thickness, which is 10–15 nm, is in agreement with a previous report in which the surface modification effect of WO3 thin films reached its limit at 10 nm.26 Further increasing the WO3 thickness (15–35 nm) hinders transport of photo-generated holes, which has a negative impact on FF. Meanwhile, JSC of the solar cells remained almost constant since the overall reflectance rates of the devices are mainly determined by the PMMA films on top. As a result, the idealized thickness of the WO3 interlayer is 10–15 nm.

From the viewpoint of prolonged use, the long-term stability of the Gr/WO3/Si solar cell was examined under ambient conditions, as shown in Fig. S5.† The device exhibits satisfactory stability with >90% of the original PCE after storage for 10 days, which is comparable with recent works.47 Although the original PCE of the solar cells is still lower than other Gr/Si solar cells with chemical doping, chemical-doping-free Gr/Si solar cells with a low degradation rate are more achievable and favorable for practical use.17 Some earlier works have reported that a WO3 thin film deposited on Gr has a p-type doping effect on Gr. One may doubt if this is why the performance of solar cells is improved. Fig. S6† compares the carrier density of Gr exposed to ambient conditions (corresponding to Gr in conventional Gr/Si solar cells) and Gr covered by a WO3 thin film using Hall effect measurements. Since the conductivity of the WO3 thin film is far lower than that of Gr, carriers in the WO3 thin film should have a negligible impact on the measurement. It is known that Gr is p-type doped by moisture and molecular oxygen under ambient conditions.48 Our result shows that the doping level of Gr is not significantly influenced by the introduction of WO3. Therefore, the improvement in the device performance cannot result from additional doping by WO3, but is from the self-generation of the quasi p–n junction.
We note there exist many alternative methods to fabricate a WO3 thin film, such as sputtering and sol–gel approaches, which have been reviewed by Meyer et al.49 and Wang et al.30 Compared with these methods, thermal evaporation is a highly controllable and highly reproducible film deposition method, which also yields a homogenous thin film with ultra-smooth morphology. Solution processes are also promising, as they offer a cheaper approach; and WO3 thin films fabricated through a solution process exhibit similar properties to the thermal evaporation deposited ones. However, usage of hydrocarbon ligands leaves residual carbon impurities inside the thin films which hinders hole (or electron) transfer and collection.50 It is interesting but challenging to fabricate WO3 thin films with these methods to further develop the idea of this work.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a new device structure for Gr/Si solar cells with self-generated quasi p–n junctions using a facile thermal evaporation deposited WO3 thin film as the interlayer between Gr and Si. The self-generation of the quasi p–n junction is caused by the large Fermi-level offset between WO3 and Si, and is advantageous compared with the conventional Schottky junction. Meanwhile, the WO3 interlayer also acts as a hole-extraction layer and electron-blocking layer. These superior characteristics enable Gr/Si solar cells with a WO3 interlayer to show improved performances compared with conventional Gr/Si solar cells. The VOC, JSC and FF of the solar cells are all enhanced; a PCE up to 10.59% was obtained after the insertion of the WO3 interlayer. This value is currently the highest for chemical-doping-free Gr/Si solar cells, and this work therefore demonstrates a new strategy to overcome the limitations hindering the development of Gr/Si solar cells. Since various TMOs with a high work function or fixed charge can be applied, the self-generation of quasi p–n junction is promising for future design and optimization of Gr/Si solar cells as well as other Si-based hybrid solar cells. In addition, further development of the TMO interlayer using alternative TMOs with more ideal optical and electrical properties is also a possible option for realization of low-cost, high-efficiency and stable photovoltaic devices.
