    , Accepted 23rd December 2019First published on 23rd December 2019AbstractPhotodetectors play a key role in the military, aerospace, communications, bio-imaging, etc. In this study, we fabricate photodetector devices based on (CH3NH3)2FeCuI4Cl2 (MA2FeCuI4Cl2) and (CH3NH3)2InCuI6 (MA2InCuI6) for the first time. We find that the device based on MA2InCuI6 is highly selective for ultraviolet light (880 nA mW−1) and shows high anti-interference for visible-light (20–50 nA mW−1). The electrochemical impedance results indicate that the value (480 ± 10 Ω) of the resistance based on the MA2InCuI6 photodetector device is much smaller than that (1 ± 0.001 MΩ) based on the MA2FeCuI4Cl2 photodetector device, which in turn proves the difference in photoelectric response.
Organic–inorganic hybrid materials (OIHMs) offer several advantages, such as optical transparency, adjustable refractive index, mechanical properties, flexibility, functionality and so on. Thence, OIHMs have come under heated discussions in the scientific research field in the last decade. An organic–inorganic hybrid lead perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) not only has high efficiency in solar cells,1,2 but also has excellent performance in lasers, LEDs and other photoelectric fields. At present, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells are reported to show a power conversion efficiency of over 24%.3 Although the organic–inorganic hybrid lead perovskite has achieved high performance, the harmfulness of lead in organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites is worrying. Therefore, exploring new lead-free OIHMs and the application of OIHMs in various types of optoelectronic devices, especially in photodetectors, are a significant and further promising direction. Recently, numerous researchers have developed alternative lead-free OIHM materials, such as tin (Sn) halide salts,4 germanium (Ge) halide salts,5 bismuth (Bi) halide salts,6 manganese (Mn) halide salts,7,8 copper halide salts (Cu),9 ferric halide salts (Fe),10 Sb(V) halide complexes,11 palladium (Pd) halide salts,12 and cobalt (Co) halide salts13 for optoelectronic applications. In addition, many research groups developed double perovskites,14 which exhibited unique optoelectronic properties. However, the optoelectronic properties of these devices are not very superior.
Based on the current problems and situation, we synthesis double metal OIHMs (MA2InCuI6 and MA2FeCuI4Cl2, MA = CH3NH3). The advantages of these two materials are as follows. Firstly, the synthesis process is simple and the production cost is low. Secondly, the materials are less toxic and greatly reduce environmental pollution. Therefore, lead-free and organic–inorganic hybrid MA2InCuI6 and MA2FeCuI4Cl2 thin films are prepared. Photodetector devices based on MA2InCuI6 and MA2FeCuI4Cl2 are fabricated to study their photoelectric behavior and electrochemical impedance.
The solubility of pure salt solution or a mixture of organic–inorganic hybrid materials is shown in Table 1. We find that FeCl3, InI3 and VCl3 can be dissolved in 1 ml DMF to form a solution, as shown in Table 1. However, the mixed solution formed by VCl3, CuI and MAI is viscous and is not suitable for spin coating. Thus, we only fabricated the photodetector devices based on MA2InCuI6 and MA2FeCuI4Cl2. The photographs of the photodetector devices based on MA2FeCuI4Cl2 and MA2InCuI6 are shown in Fig. 1a. The size of the device is 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm and each device contains 6 photodetectors. The active area of each photodetector is 0.16 cm2. Cross-section schematics of the photodetector devices based on MA2FeCuI4Cl2 and MA2InCuI6 are shown in Fig. 1b. As we can see from Fig. 1c, the thicknesses of F-doped tin oxide (FTO), a compact layer of TiO2 (C-TiO2), a mesoporous layer of TiO2 (M-TiO2) and a gold electrode are 409, 102, 414 and 84 nm, respectively. Besides, the solutions of MA2InCuI6 and MA2FeCuI4Cl2 were injected into the mesoporous layer of TiO2 to form mesoporous heterojunction devices. The thicknesses of every layer in the FTO/C-TiO2/M-TiO2/MA2FeCuI4Cl2/Au device are similar to those of the FTO/C-TiO2/M-TiO2/MA2InCuI6/Au device (Fig. 1d).

The surfaces of the MA2FeCuI4Cl2 thin films and MA2InCuI6 thin films both have island-like crystals, as shown in Fig. 2a and b. The diagrams of elemental distribution in the selected area of MA2InCuI6 thin films and MA2FeCuI4Cl2 thin films are shown in Fig. 2c and d. Each element represented by a different color is marked in the figure and is evenly distributed in the selected area. The proportional relationship between the elements can be seen from Fig. 2e. Thus, we conclude that the compositions of the two materials are MA2FeCuI4Cl2 and MA2InCuI6. However, the ratio of the Cu element to the In element is not 1:1, because the In element in the FTO is counted in the measurement. The XRD patterns of MA2FeCuI4Cl2 and MA2InCuI6 are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI‡). The large interplanar distance indicates that MA2FeCuI4Cl2 is a layered structure. In addition, the interplanar distance of MA2InCuI6 is smaller than that of MA2FeCuI4Cl2. Thus, MA2InCuI6 is a three-dimensional-like perovskite structure. This may be the reason for its better photoelectric performance than MA2FeCuI4Cl2. The physical properties of MA2InCuI6 compounds were determined using a Hall effect measurement system. The detailed parameters are listed in Table S1 (ESI‡). The carrier mobility of MA2InCuI6 is 1.0860 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1. The type of carrier is electrons. But the physical properties of MA2FeCuI4Cl2 cannot be obtained due to large resistance. The absorption spectra of the two compounds are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI‡). The absorption intensity of MA2InCuI6 is stronger than that of MA2FeCuI4Cl2 from 350 to 1500 nm.

The photoresponses of these two devices are unclear, so we tested the photocurrent density–time at different wavelengths, as shown in Fig. 3a and b. The photocurrent density shows a rising trend when the light is turned on. The photocurrent density shows a downward trend when the light is turned off. We can clearly see that both devices exhibit maximum photocurrent density under 369 nm ultraviolet light. The different photoresponse between the two devices is also obvious. For instance, the maximum photocurrent density of the photodetector device based on MA2InCuI6 is about 960 nA cm−2 and that based on MA2FeCuI4Cl2 is only about 25 nA cm−2 under 369 nm ultraviolet light (3 mW cm−2). The I–V response of the photodetector of MA2InCuI6 in the presence and absence of 365 nm UV light is shown in Fig. 3c. The results show that the slope increases under 369 nm UV light, which indicates that the resistance of MA2InCuI6 reduced under 369 nm UV light. We have seen the recent excellent literature on photodetectors.15,16 Usually photocurrent either shows positive or negative response under the illumination of light. However, Fig. 3a and b shows switching of photocurrent from positive to negative at 369 nm. This phenomenon may be related to the built-in electric field of the device itself. In future research, we will learn and try new and very simple methods for making photodetectors and heterostructures according to the recent excellent literature to verify whether this phenomenon still exists.

(a) On/off signal (photocurrent density–time) of the photodetector device based on MA2InCuI6 at different wavelengths; (b) on/off signal (photocurrent density–time) of the photodetector device based on MA2FeCuI4Cl2 at different wavelengths; (c) I–V response of the MA2InCuI6 photodetector in the presence and absence of 365 nm UV light; (d) sensitivity of the photodetector device based on MA2FeCuI4Cl2; and (e) sensitivity of the photodetector device based on MA2InCuI6. 
We define the photocurrent density at the highest point as Ion and at the lowest point as Ioff. The sensitivity of photodetector devices based on MA2InCuI6 and MA2FeCuI4Cl2 is obtained according to the sensitivity formula (Ion − Ioff)/I (I = 3 mW cm−2), as shown in Fig. 3d and e. The sensitivity of the photodetector device based on MA2FeCuI4Cl2 is 14 nA mW−1 and that based on MA2InCuI6 is about 880 nA mW−1 under 369 nm ultraviolet light. The results show that the photoresponse of the MA2InCuI6 material is stronger than that of the MA2FeCuI4Cl2 material under 369 nm ultraviolet light. Besides, the device based on MA2InCuI6 is highly selective for ultraviolet light (880 nA mW−1) and shows high anti-interference for visible-light (20–50 nA mW−1). Thus, we believe that the MA2InCuI6 material has higher application value in the field of ultraviolet detectors.
We tested the electrochemical impedance to explore the reason for different photoelectric responses. The electrochemical impedances of photodetector devices based on MA2FeCuI4Cl2 and MA2InCuI6 are shown in Fig. 4a. The system resistance (Rs) originates from the resistor of the device. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) comes from the Rct1 (charge transfer between organic–inorganic hybrid materials and TiO2) and Rct2 (the charge transfer between organic–inorganic hybrid materials and the Au electrode). The electrochemical impedance parameters are received using Z-View software. For the photodetector device based on MA2FeCuI4Cl2Rs = 25 ± 3 Ω and Rct = 1 ± 0.001 MΩ. For the photodetector device based on MA2InCuI6Rs = 12 ± 2 Ω and Rct = 480 ± 10 Ω. The Rct and Rs values of the photodetector device based on MA2InCuI6 are significantly less than those based on MA2FeCuI4Cl2. The difference in electrochemical impedance leads to distinct photoelectric behaviors. This better reflects the advantages of MA2InCuI6 materials in photodetectors.
