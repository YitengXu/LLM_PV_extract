    , Accepted 8th February 2020First published on 19th February 2020AbstractMolecular sieves are of increasing importance in catalysis, the oil industry, and biomedicine. Traditional molecular sieves are generally oxides that inevitably show some absorption in the mid- and far-IR range due to the vibrations of metal–oxygen bonds, which are unfavorable for the in situ observation of the reactions in molecular sieves through IR techniques. In this study, a new metal halide In[Ba3Cl3F6] has been synthesized. It exhibits a quite transparent window from 0.366 to 22 μm and good adsorption and desorption processes.
Metal halides are of current research interest due to their potential applications in the fields of nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals,1–5 photovoltaics,6–13 lasers and photo-detector materials.14,15 As photovoltaics, CH3NH3PbI3-type compounds possess a suitable energy band gap and high extinction coefficients. They have improved the power conversion efficiency of solar cells to 22.7%.12,16–18 As photo-detector materials, the CH3NH3PbI3 epitaxial thin film exhibits the highest detectivity (6.5 × 1013 Jones) in the MAPbI3-based photoconductors reported so far. Besides, it also possesses shorter response times (the rise time (τrise) and fall time (τfall) are approximately 17 μs) and bigger responsivity (20.7 A W−1) than chalcogenides.15 Especially as NLO materials, metal halides have been reported to possess a wide IR transparent window and be able to achieve a significant balance between the NLO responses and laser damage thresholds, which is considered the largest challenge for IR NLO materials. During the past several years, a series of high-performance metal halide IR NLO crystals have been synthesized, including K2SbF2Cl3 (0.3–14 μm, 5× KDP),19 CsSbF3Cl (0.3× KDP),20 and Cs2HgI2Cl2 (0.4–41 μm, 83 MW cm−2, 2× AgGaS2).1,21 Recently, Lin's group also reviewed the recent advances on IR NLO metal halides, and some instructive rules were put forward as well.3
Under the guidance of “Science of Synthesis”,22–29 in this study, considering that the coexistence of two or more types of halide anions can increase the anisotropy and enrich the structural chemistry of metal halides, we carried out detailed material explorations in the In3+-based alkaline earth metal mixed halide system, which resulted in the successful synthesis of a new mixed halide, In[Ba3Cl3F6]. The crystal structure is composed of the six-member rings (6-MRs) [Ba6Cl6F18]12− and the [InF6] triangular prism. Interestingly, a pore of 0.769 nm is discovered in the 6-MRs, which indicates that In[Ba3Cl3F6] has the potential to be used as a new type of molecular sieve. It is well-known that the traditional molecular sieves are oxides which are generally composed of metal–oxygen tetrahedron groups, such as silicates,30–32 aluminosilicates33,34 and aluminophosphates,35–37etc. These molecular sieves have been widely used in the fields of catalysis,38,39 the oil industry,40,41 and biomedicine.42 However, notably, for the traditional oxide molecular sieves, they inevitably show some absorption in the mid-IR, far-IR or even near-IR range owing to the vibrations of metal–oxygen bonds. These absorptions may interfere with the in situ observation of the reactions inside molecular sieves through IR techniques owing to the own IR absorptions of molecular sieves.43–46 Different from traditional oxide molecular sieves, the molecular sieves composed of metal–halogen bonds can exhibit a much wider IR transparent range.1,3,4,19,20,47,48 They can be transparent in the whole IR characteristic absorption range of organic molecules in the oil industry and biomedicine. Therefore, they will be more interesting for the research of the reactions in molecular sieves.
The title compound was obtained by using BaCl2·2H2O (99.5%), In2O3 (99.99%), and H5IO6 (99%) as the starting materials under hydrothermal conditions (see the ESI†). Its crystal structure was determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The pure phase was synthesized by the traditional solid state reaction technique, and the purity was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (Fig. S3, ESI†). This shows that the experimental XRD pattern is in good agreement with the calculated one.
The structure of the compound was determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction, and the existence of Ba2+, In3+, Cl− and F− was also checked by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) analysis (Fig. S4, ESI†). An average Ba/In/Cl/F molar ratio of 3.23:1.00:2.74:5.86 was evaluated by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental analysis, which was close to the stoichiometric ratio of 3:1:3:6 (Fig. S5, ESI†).
In[Ba3Cl3F6] crystallizes in the hexagonal space group P63/m (No. 176). The crystal structure is shown in Fig. 1. In the asymmetric unit, there are the following unique atoms: one In, three Ba, three Cl and six F. The Ba2+ cations are coordinated by three Cl− anions and four F− anions to form a [BaCl3F4]5− polyhedron (Fig. 1a), while the In3+ cations are surrounded by six F− anions to form the six-coordinated [InF6]3− triangular-prism configuration (Fig. 1b and d). The [BaCl3F4]5− polyhedra connect with each other by edge-sharing to form the [Ba6Cl6F18]12− 6-MRs (Fig. 1c). These [Ba6Cl6F18]12− 6-MRs are further connected by the [InF6]3− polyhedra through the Ba–F–In bonds to build the framework of In[Ba3Cl3F6] (Fig. 1e). All the In–F bonds have the same bond lengths of 2.0926(18) Å. For the Ba–F and the Ba–Cl bonds, their bond lengths range from 2.7233(18) to 2.9342(18) Å and 3.1500(5) to 3.1610(12) Å, respectively. Bond valence calculations result in the bond valence sums (BVSs) of 2.137 for the Ba2+ cations, 3.064 for the In3+ cations, 1.095 for the Cl− anions, and 0.94 for the F− anions. All of them are consistent with their expected oxidation states.

Interestingly, a uniform pore canal with an internal diameter of 0.769 nm has been observed in In[Ba3Cl3F6] (Fig. 1e), which is similar to the previous molecular sieves, e.g. JLG-12,49 ITQ-4950 and MCM-41.51 This indicates that In[Ba3Cl3F6] will be a potential halide molecular sieve. Furthermore, the structural porosity of In[Ba3Cl3F6] has been proved by the physical adsorption experiment. The N2 adsorption isotherm and the pore size distribution of the sample are shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. Although the uptake of N2 is a little low, this is also observed in other molecular sieves, such as 0.18 cm3 g−1 in ITQ-49,50 0.28 cm3 g−1 in EMM-23,52 and 1.02 cm3 g−1 in a purely siliceous highly ordered MCM-48.53 The low uptake of N2 may be because of the relatively low channel density, i.e. only one channel is present in a unit cell (Fig. 1). Clearly, the N2 adsorption isotherm is IUPAC type IV with hysteresis loops of H3,54 indicating the existence of mesopores. At low relative pressure, the N2 adsorption volume increases slowly with the increase in relative pressure (a gradual curvature), which is due to the monolayer to multilayer adsorption of N2 in the pore. It is an indication of a significant amount of overlap of monolayer coverage and the onset of multilayer adsorption. As the relative pressure increases (P/P0 > 0.9), the isotherms exhibit sharp inflections in the P/P0 range from 0.9 to 1, characteristic of capillary condensation within uniform pores (Fig. 2a). The P/P0 position of the inflection points is clearly related to a diameter in the mesopore range. We can discover that “the variation width of the capillary condensation step in an isotherm can be used as the basis for measuring the mesoporous uniformity because each value of P/P0 in the condensation step corresponds to a value of Kelvin radius (Rk)” from many studies.54–57 For the adsorption isotherm of In[Ba3Cl3F6] (Fig. 2a), a narrow P/P0 in the capillary condensation step, i.e. a sharp increase in a narrow P/P0 range from 0.9 to 1, has been observed. So, it indicates that the pore distribution of the material is narrow and the pore size is uniform.

The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method was employed to analyze the pore size distribution. The corresponding pore size distribution plot is shown in Fig. 2b. It can be obtained from the N2 adsorption isotherm based on the modified Kelvin equation: ln(P/P0) = −2γVm/RT(rp − tc). The peak on this plot corresponds to the pore width. We can find easily that the peak of the pore-size distribution is 4.88 nm and the range of pore-size distribution is narrow, which indicates that the pore size is uniform. Besides, the uniformity in pore size is proved by the structure of In[Ba3Cl3F6] (Fig. 1). The peak is obtained at about 4.88 nm, which is much larger than that obtained from the crystallographic data. This discrepancy is also observed in previously reported other zeolites, such as ITQ-49, Ru-TiO2 and γ-MnO2.50,57–59 It may be that the channel connectivity leads to the overestimation of the pore size in the adsorption experiment.50 These results indicate that In[Ba3Cl3F6] is promising as a potential IR transparent molecular sieve with a uniform channel.
It is worth noting that In[Ba3Cl3F6] is different from the traditional oxide molecular sieves. It is composed of halides, so it will exhibit a wider transparency window, especially in the IR range. In order to measure the IR transparent region of In[Ba3Cl3F6], a micro-infrared transmission spectrum has been obtained using a Nicolet™ Continuum™ IR Microscope and Nicolet iS50 FTIR Spectrometer manufactured by Thermo-Fisher (Fig. 3b). This equipment can allow us to obtain the IR transmission spectrum with a crystal at the micron and even nanometer scales. The result shows that In[Ba3Cl3F6] is transparent from 2.5 to 22 μm, which covers most of the IR characteristic absorption range of organic molecules. The UV-VIS-NIR diffusion reflectance spectrum of In[Ba3Cl3F6] is also further measured. As shown in Fig. 3a, In[Ba3Cl3F6] also has a wide VIS-NIR transparent window from 0.366 to 2.5 μm. Combining the IR transmission and UV-VIS-NIR diffusion reflectance spectra, it is clear that In[Ba3Cl3F6] can be transparent from 0.366 to 22 μm. The transparency window of In[Ba3Cl3F6] is obviously wider than other previously reported conventional molecular sieves, e.g. MCM-48 (2.5–4 μm)53 and SBA-15 (2.5–2.8 μm).55 This will favor its application as an IR transparent molecular sieve and allow the in situ observation of the reactions in molecular sieves.

Furthermore, the thermal stability of In[Ba3Cl3F6] was also studied by TG/DTA measurement (Fig. 4a). It is clear that In[Ba3Cl3F6] is stable up to 650 °C. After 650 °C, there are two steps of weight loss on its TG curve. From 650 to 800 °C, the weight loss is ∼9.5%, which consists of the volatilization of 2F2 (10%). Its residue is the mixed phase of BaClF and In2O3 as confirmed by powder XRD (Fig. 4b). From 1000 to 1300 °C, the weight loss is ∼27.5%, which consists of the volatilization of 1BaCl2 (28.03%). Its residue is the mixed phase of BaO and In2O3 (Fig. 4c).

In summary, a new IR transparent metal–halide molecular sieve, In[Ba3Cl3F6], has been synthesized by the hydrothermal method. It features a one-dimensional channel composed of the [Ba6Cl6F18]12− 6-MRs with a pore size of 4.88 nm. The structural porosity of In[Ba3Cl3F6] is proved by the physical adsorption experiment, which exhibits an IUPAC type-IV N2 adsorption isotherm. As In[Ba3Cl3F6] is composed of halides, it is transparent in a very wide spectral range from 0.366 to 22 μm. The TG/DSC measurement indicates that In[Ba3Cl3F6] has a good thermal stability of up to 650 °C. Therefore, In[Ba3Cl3F6] will be important for application in in situ IR spectroscopic analysis of the internal reactions of molecular sieves. This research will open new opportunities for metal halides as IR-transparent molecular sieves.
