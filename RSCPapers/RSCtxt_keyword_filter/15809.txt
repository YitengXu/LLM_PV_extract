    , Accepted 9th August 2012First published on 17th August 2012AbstractPerylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimides (PDI) have been linked to norbornene through either an imide or a “bay” position. These PDI-functionalised norbornenes are readily polymerised using a ruthenium ring-opening metathesis polymerisation (ROMP) initiator. In one case the polymerisation is shown to be well controlled with a linear dependence of molecular weight on the monomer/initiator ratio. For the polymers with PDI–norbornene linkages through the imide nitrogen, UV-vis spectroscopy suggests significant PDI aggregation both in dilute solution and the solid state, a powder X-ray diffraction peak attributable to π-stacking is seen, and weak n-channel field-effect transistor behavior (electron mobilities <5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) was observed. In contrast, the “bay”-linked polymer shows essentially monomer-like UV-vis spectra in both solution and the solid state, no X-ray evidence for π-stacking, and no measurable transistor behaviour. The polymers were used as acceptors in bulk heterojunction solar cells in combination with poly(3-hexylthiophene): low power conversion efficiencies (≤0.38%) were obtained, largely due to low short-circuit currents, again with the “bay”-linked polymer giving the poorest performance.
Introduction
Perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimides (PDIs) are among the most promising electron acceptors for organic-based electronic devices; they exhibit electron affinities (EAs) similar to the fullerenes and, in many cases, high electron mobilities, while their high visible absorptivities are potentially attractive for organic photovoltaic (OPV) applications.1–5 However, although vacuum-deposited bilayer OPV cells containing PDI-based acceptors and small-molecule donors, such as pentacene,6 rubrene,7 and CuPc,8 have been found to exhibit promising power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 2%, the use of PDI small molecules in solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OPV cells has been less successful, with PCEs often lower than 0.1% for blends with donor polymers such as poly(3-n-hexylthiophene) (P3HT).3,9 These low PCEs may, at least in part, be due to problems in obtaining morphologies suitable for efficient charge separation and collection; for example, phase segregation giving large (>10 μm) PDI-rich regions has been found in some cases.2,10 PDI-based polymeric materials might offer a better approach to obtaining more appropriate film morphologies. Both conjugated and side-chain polymer approaches have been investigated. Conjugated polymers in which PDIs are linked through various bridging groups through their 1,7 (“bay”) positions have exhibited PCEs as high as 1.5% in BHJ blends with suitable polythiophene donors,11–13 although the absorption of the PDI conjugated materials makes little contribution to the photocurrent, in part due to their low exciton lifetimes.14 The side-chain PDI-polymer approach has the potential to combine the desirable electronic and optical properties of small-molecule PDIs, such as their EAs and light-harvesting ability, with the mechanical strength and film-forming properties of an electronically inert main chain,2,15–20 although device performance to date has been poorer compared to that of the best main-chain conjugated PDI polymers. Moreover, diblock copolymers of PDI pendant monomers with donor blocks offer the possibility of controlling and stabilising nm-scale phase-segregation within the active layer and dramatically increasing the solar cell16 and OFET21 performance. Accordingly, further exploration of PDI side-chain polymers incorporating different main- and side-chain pendants may help in achieving efficient solution-processible BHJ OPV cells incorporating PDIs.15–18,21
Here we report on polynorbornenes with PDI side chains (Fig. 1), their optical and electrochemical properties, measurement of their electron mobility in field-effect transistors (OFETs), and their use in BHJ OPV cells with P3HT. The polynorbornene backbone was chosen due to its flexibility, the good chemical stability of norbornene monomers and polymers relative to that of other systems such as styrenes and acrylates, its high transparency in the visible and near-infrared (NIR), and the possibility of obtaining living polymerisation using ring-opening initiated by ruthenium-based initiators,22 potentially facilitating future synthesis of well-defined block copolymers with phase-segregation behaviour. Moreover, there are precedents for the successful use of functionalised polynorbornenes as active materials in solution-processed light-emitting diodes and OPV cells.19,20,23–26

Results and discussion
Synthesis
Two norbornene monomers in which PDI moieties are attached to the polymerisable group through one of their imide nitrogen atoms and differing in the length of the “swallow-tail” substituent at the other imide position (Fig. 1, Scheme 1, C7PDI and C11PDI) were synthesised and polymerised (to give C11PDI HP and C7PDI HP). Imidisation of perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) with the appropriate “swallow-tail” primary amine, following a literature procedure, gave the symmetrical perylene diimides, C11C11PDI and C7C7PDI, in high isolated yields.27 Hydrolysis of these diimides gave the perylene monoimide monoanhydride compounds, A1 and A2, in yields of ca. 50%.28 Imidisation of A1 or A2 with large excesses of 3-aminopropan-1-ol afforded the hydroxy-functionalised PDIs B1 or B2 respectively, in 75–90% yield. N,N′-Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide/4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (DCC/DMAP) was used to promote the coupling of exo-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2-carboxylic acid with B1 or B2 to give the PDI-grafted monomers, C11PDI or C7PDI respectively, in isolated yields of over 80%. As is typical for PDIs, these two PDI/norbornene monomers are quite stable; no obvious change was observed in their 1H NMR spectra, UV-Vis absorption spectra, or reactivity after shelf-storage under ambient conditions for over three year.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of C11PDI and C7PDI monomers and homopolymers. 
Although the apparent molecular weights in Table 1 (obtained using GPC in toluene) are smaller than the ideal molecular weight (ca. 40 kDa with degree of polymerisation of 50) expected for “living” ROMP, this may be because the PDI-grafted polymer-chains adopt different conformations from the polystyrene standards used for the GPC. Indeed, the apparent values of Mn for C11PDI HP were found to be strongly dependent on the choice of GPC solvent (ca. 16.9 and 66.5 kDa in THF and chloroform, respectively, with larger Mw/Mn values than that in toluene). Moreover, we also synthesised C11PDI HP in a “diblock” approach using two sequential portions of the C11PDI monomer (see ESI† for details).29 As shown in Fig. 2, the increase in Mn observed between the first block and the “diblock” indicates a linear dependence of Mn on the [monomer]/[initiator] ratio, suggesting a well-controlled polymerisation (also supported by the first-order type polymerisation kinetics; see Fig. S1 in the ESI†) and the possibility of obtaining well-defined donor–acceptor block copolymers, for example, in combination with oligothiophene-functionalised norbornenes such as those previously reported by Ng and co-workers.25,26

 Fig. 2  Dependence of molecular weight (Mn) of C11PDI HP on [Monomer]/[Initiator] during a “diblock” type C11PDI HP synthesis with sequential additions of C11PDI monomer (see ESI† for details). 
The synthesis of the N-PDI HP (Scheme 2) began with mono-bromination of a symmetrical PDI11,30 to give C, using a modification of a procedure described in literature.31 Nucleophilic displacement of the bromo substituent on the PDI-bay position of compound C with 2-(piperazin-1-yl)ethanol in NMP afforded the corresponding hydroxy-functionalised derivative D in moderate yield.32,33 A DCC/DMAP-based coupling reaction was then used to synthesise the new monomer (N-PDI) at ambient temperature in 90% yield. Polymerisations similar to those described above for C11- and C7-PDI gave N-PDI HP in moderate yield (60%) after purification through multiple precipitations, Soxhlet washing with hot methanol and acetone, and size-exclusion chromatography.34 This polymer has a broader molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn = 1.7) than those for the two polymers described above in which the norbornene is linked via the imide to the PDI. The number-average molecular weight, Mn, was estimated to be 19.6 kDa using GPC eluting with toluene, lower than the expected molecular weight (60 kDa), presumably for the same reason as that discussed above for C7PDI HP and C11PDI HP. N-PDI HP shows excellent solubility in common organic solvents, such as toluene (∼40 mg mL−1), dichloromethane, chloroform, and THF.

Thermal properties
As shown in Table 1 and Fig. S2,† thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under nitrogen indicates that all three homopolymers exhibited good thermal stability with decomposition temperatures, Td, defined at the temperature at which 5% of the mass is lost, of ca. 380 °C. The glass transition temperatures, Tg, obtained using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis under nitrogen are also shown in Table 1 and Fig. S2†; the much lower Tg of N-PDI HP relative to those of the other two homopolymers is perhaps related to the the limited π-stacking of the PDI units suggested by absorption spectra and powder XRD (vide infra). The Tg of C11PDI HP is slightly lower than that of C7PDI HP, presumably as a result of the longer alkyl N-substituents. There is, however, a very small endothermic transition observed at 223 °C on heating C11PDI HP, suggesting some limited crystallinity for this polymer, while no obvious melting transition is observed for C7PDI HP or N-PDI HP.
Optical properties
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the three homopolymers and corresponding monomers in dilute chloroform solution (ca. 1 × 10−5 M) are shown in Fig. 3. C7PDI and C11PDI show essentially identical spectra, as one would expect given their chemical similarity. The distinct vibronic structure (Δν = ca. 1400 cm−1) found for the main visible absorption is typical for PDIs35 and the ratios between the absorbances of the 0,0 and 0,1 vibronic sub-bands (ca. 1.66 for both monomers at this concentration) are consistent with free non-aggregated PDIs.35,36 The peak absorptivities of the two PDI homopolymers are much lower than those for respective monomers at similar dye concentration and the A0,0/A0,1 ratios are much smaller (0.89 and 0.91, respectively, for C7PDI HP and C11PDI HP), suggesting a high degree of PDI aggregation, even in dilute solution, presumably between neighbouring PDIs along the polymer chain.36,37
 Fig. 3  UV-Vis absorption spectra of PDI monomers (above) and polymers (below) in chloroform at concentrations of ca. 1 × 10−5 M. 
The spectra of spin-coated thin films of the polymers are even more severely affected by aggregation, showing further reduced A0,0/A0,1 ratios (ESI, Fig. S3†). The main absorption bands of N-PDI and N-PDI HP are significantly red-shifted from those of C7PDI and C11PDI with lower peak absorptivities, are broad, and lack vibronic structure, consistent with what is seen for other PDIs with “bay” amino substituents.32 The broader absorption spectra of the N-PDI type materials potentially provide better solar spectrum coverage for OPV applications.2,38,39 However, the similarity of the absorption spectra between the N-PDI monomer and N-PDI HP, both in solution and in thin films (Fig. S1†), suggests more limited π-stacking between the PDIs, perhaps due to the steric effects of the bay substitutions on the core planarity,40–42 and, therefore, the possibility of reduced electron mobility. This is further supported by powder X-ray diffraction. As shown in Fig. 4, all three polymers show a broad peak at d-spacing of ca. 4.7 Å, typical for a so-called “amorphous halo” arising from alkyl–alkyl correlations,21 but C7PDI HP and C11PDI HP show an additional diffraction peak at a d-spacing of 3.5 Å, comparable to π-stacking distances reported in other small-molecule or polymeric PDI materials,1,21 while no such peak is observed for N-PDI HP.

The emission spectra of C11PDI and C11PDI HP at low concentration (ca. 1 × 10−6 M) are shown in Fig. 5; the fluorescence spectra obtained for C7PDI and C11PDI monomers are mirror images of the low-energy absorption bands,1,35,43 whereas the emission spectra for C7PDI HP and C11PDI HP lack vibronic fine structure and exhibit a ca. 100 nm red-shift of the emission maximum, suggesting emission from aggregate states,43 consistent with the differences seen in the absorption spectra of the monomers and polymers. No detectable emission was observed for either N-PDI or N-PDI HP in various common solvents such as toluene and dichloromethane.

Electrochemistry
All three monomers exhibit two successive reversible reductions (see ESI, Fig. S4† for voltammograms); the half-wave potentials are shown in Table 2 and are similar to those seen for other simple PDIs.1,3N-PDI is slightly less readily reduced than C11PDI and C7PDI (by ca. 0.1 V), consistent with the difference of 0.25–0.30 V seen between the reduction potentials of PDIs and their 1,(6)7-dipyrrolidino-substituted analogues.32,44 In contrast to C11PDI and C7PDI, N-PDI also shows an oxidation (Ired/Iox = ca. 0.1 at 50 mV s−1, indicating instability of the radical ion on the timescale of the scan) within the accessible solvent window due to the presence of the electron-donating amine group; this is broadly consistent with what has been reported for 1,(6)7-dipyrrolidino PDIs where, however, the oxidation is fully reversible and further shifted cathodically.41,44,45Table 2 also includes estimates of the free-energy changes for charge-separation in P3HT/PDI-polymer blends from either donor or acceptor excited states, ΔGCS;36,46 in all cases the charge-separation process is expected to be highly exergonic.

Field-effect transistors
To investigate the electron-transport properties of the polymers, OFETs, with top-contact calcium source and drain electrodes, were fabricated on a silica dielectric, coated with a bis(benzocyclobutene) derivative (BCB) to limit the number of electron-trapping sites at the organic–dielectric interface.47 As shown in Table 3 (see also Fig. S5, ESI,† for an example of device characteristics), C11PDI HP and C7PDI HP-based transistors exhibit low electron mobilities; these are somewhat improved by annealing at 200 °C (above Tg in both cases, see Table 1) for 1 h in a nitrogen glove-box, but then decrease after further annealing at 250 °C. C7PDI HP shows slightly higher OFET mobility values under a given set of conditions than C11PDI HP, perhaps related to its shorter alkyl chains and, therefore, higher overall PDI content. No detectable field-effect electron mobility was observed from analogous devices based on N-PDI HP, either before or after annealing. This may be due to reduced π-stacking owing to the effects of the bay substituent, as discussed above in the context of UV-vis spectra and power X-ray diffraction data, and is also broadly consistent with previous studies in which bay-substituted derivatives show lower mobility values than their unsubstituted analogues (for example, in vacuum-deposited OFETs μe = ca. 1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for a 1,6,7,12-tetrachloro PDI vs. > 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 for similar PDIs without bay substituents).48

Photovoltaic behavior
As discussed above, the electrochemical and optical properties of the polymers suggest that they may be suitable candidates for use as acceptors in solar cells in combination with donors such as P3HT. Accordingly, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaic devices were fabricated using the homopolymers in 1:1 wt/wt blends with P3HT as the active layer (ca. 100 nm thickness); the performance of the devices is summarised in Table 4.49 The cells all show low power-conversion efficiencies, PCEs, compared to devices based on fullerene acceptors, although the value of 0.38% is among the highest reported to date for a P3HT:PDI BHJ device.15,50 The open-circuit voltages, VOC, for the P3HT:C11PDI HP and P3HT:C7PDI HP devices are comparable to those seen for many other more efficient organic solar cells, such as P3HT:PCBM cells, consistent with the similar EAs of the polymers (Table 2) and the fullerene (3.8 eV);51 however, that for P3HT:N-PDI HP is significantly lower. The fill factors, FF, are somewhat low, but the much poorer overall PCEs obtained relative to analogous fullerene-based cells are largely attributable to the low short-circuit currents, JSC. Moreover, the variation in PCEs between materials is largely due to variations in JSC. The profiles of incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) plots (Fig. 6) are similar to those seen for P3HT:PCBM devices39 suggesting that the P3HT absorption is the main contributor to the photocurrent; this may be at least partly due to weaker absorption of the PDI polymers relative to P3HT (Fig. S6, ESI†, shows the spectra of P3HT:C7/C11PDI HP films, which are dominated by P3HT).52 In all cases, the low values of JSC may be related to the low μe values (see above), which may result in charge accumulation and inefficient charge collection, while their imbalance with the donor hole mobility (μh = ca. 10−3 to 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 in P3HT:PCBM blends)39 could contribute to the low FF values by promoting charge recombination.53,54 The especially low JSC values found for P3HT:N-PDI HP blends may be related to a particularly low value of μe, consistent with the lack of detectable OFET behaviour noted above, which may in turn be associated with the absence of π-stacking in this material. Differences in the morphology, leading to variations in the charge-separation efficiency and/or in charge-transport pathways, could also play a role in the variation in JSC and PCE values. As shown in the AFM topography images (Fig. 7), the surfaces of C11PDI HP/P3HT films (prepared in a similar way to those used in the devices) are much smoother (average roughness of 1–2 nm) and more homogeneous than those of C7PDI HP/P3HT films (average roughness of ca. 15 nm), in which isolated islands appear, similar to features attributed to PDI aggregates in other PDI/donor polymer blends.46 Moreover, the domains indicated by AFM surface potential images (Fig. S7, ESI†), are somewhat smaller for C11PDI HP/P3HT films (300–400 nm) than that for C7PDI HP/P3HT films (>ca. 1 μm), implying a greater donor/acceptor interfacial area and, therefore, more efficient exciton dissociation. However, it should be noted that AFM images shown here only provide information about lateral phase separation at the surface, rather than the arrangement of donor and acceptor domains within the bulk of the film.

Conclusions
Ruthenium-complex-initiated ROMP can be carried out successfully on PDI-functionalised norbornenes. At least in the case of the polymers examined here, the polymers to which the PDI moieties are tethered through the imide show evidence of significant PDI–PDI aggregation, even in dilute solution, and exhibit measurable, albeit fairly low, electron mobility values in OFETs; in contrast, the “bay”-linked example shows very similar spectra in both solution and films to the corresponding monomer and did not afford functioning OFETs under the same conditions used for the imide-linked polymers. The difference between these two classes of polymers is likely to be linked to the non-planarity of “bay”-substituted PDIs. BHJ OPV cells based on blends of P3HT with the imide-linked polymers also perform considerably better than those based on blends with the “bay”-linked example, although their overall power conversion efficiencies are still low, with the relatively weak polymer absorption, low values of μe, and unsuitable morphologies also being possible contributory factors. Since the surface morphology and OPV performance is found to depend on the terminal imide substituent of the pendant PDI groups, further optimisation of this substituent may lead to improved performance. Optimisation of the donor–acceptor ratios used in the BHJ cells and of the donor structure may also help improve OPV performance. Finally, it is worth noting that the controlled nature of the polymerisation offers the possibility of using these PDI–norbornene monomers for synthesising the acceptor block of donor–acceptor block copolymers.
Experimental section
General
Most organic and inorganic chemicals were obtained from Aldrich, Alfa Aesar, and TCI and used without further purification. 1-Undecyl-dodecylamine,55 8-aminopentadecane,55 and the pure exo-isomer of bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2-carboxylic acid56 were synthesised via literature procedures. N,N′-Bis(1-undecyl-dodecyl)perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide,57N,N′-bis(1-heptyloctyl)perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide,58 compounds A1, A2, and N,N′-bis(2-decyl-tetradecyl)-perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxydimide11,30 were synthesised by minor modifications of literature procedures (see ESI†). 1H and 13C NMR spectra were collected on a Bruker 400 MHz or a Bruker 500 MHz spectrometer. Mass spectra were measured on an Applied Biosystems 4700 Proteomics Analyzer using MALDI mode. Elemental analyses were carried out by Atlantic Microlab using a LECO 932 CHNS elemental analyzer. Solution and thin-film UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary 500 UV/Vis/near-IR spectrophotometer while solution emission spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu FP-5301PC spectrofluorometer. Electrochemical measurements were carried out under nitrogen in deoxygenated 0.1 M solutions of tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate in dry dichloromethane using a computer-controlled BAS 100B electrochemical analyser, a glassy-carbon working electrode, a platinum-wire auxiliary electrode, and an Ag wire anodised with AgCl as a pseudo-reference electrode. The cyclic voltammetry was performed using a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The potentials were referenced to ferrocenium/ferrocene by use of internal ferrocene. TGA measurements were performed on an NETZSCH STA 449C analyser under a nitrogen flow of 40 mL min−1 with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. DSC measurements were performed on a TA Instruments DSC Q200 analyser under a nitrogen flow of 50 mL min−1 with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. Powder XRD data were collected in Bragg–Brentano geometry on a Scintag X1 diffractometer with a Cu Kα source (λ = 1.5406 Å) in a continuous scan mode with a step size of 0.02°.
AFM was carried out with a two-pass lift mode procedure using a Veeco Multimode IV AFM. The surface topography was obtained by ageneric tapping mode scan in the first pass and the surface potential is measured on the second pass. On the first pass (main scan), the cantilever was mechanically vibrated near its resonant frequency by a small piezoelectric oscillator. On the second pass (interleave scan), the tip ascends to a constant lift scan height (20 nm); the tapping mode excitation oscillator is turned off and an oscillating AC voltage is applied directly to the probe tip. A lock-in amplifier and a servo feedback unit were used to track the cantilever oscillation at the resonant frequency and record the contact potential. Nanoworld SCM-PIT probes were selected for EFM and KPFM operation. The mechanical properties (force constant k = 2.8 N m−1 and resonance frequency f = 75 kHz) and the special Pt/Ir5 coating of probes are optimised for electrostatic force application. The typical tip radius of curvature is less than 25 nm.

The resultant red precipitate was filtered and washed sequentially with 2 N aqueous HCl (10 mL), water (2 × 20 mL), and methanol (3 × 20 mL). The red solid was then heated in methanol (30 mL) for 1 h at reflux and filtered when hot to provide pure B1 as a red solid (0.30 g, 92%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3): δ 8.70–8.60 (m, 8H), 5.15 (m, 1H), 4.38 (t, J = 6.6 Hz, 2H), 3.62 (t, J = 5.4 Hz, 2H), 2.23 (m, 2H), 2.00 (m, 2H), 1.84 (m, 2H), 1.51–1.16 (m, 36H), 0.82 (t, J = 6.6 Hz, 6H), (the alcohol proton was not observed). 13C{1H} NMR (125 MHz, CDCl3): δ 164.4, 163.8, 163.3, 134.8, 133.8, 131.6, 131.4, 130.8, 129.3, 129.2, 126.2, 126.0, 124.1, 123.3, 123.1, 122.7, 122.5, 58.9, 54.8, 37.0, 32.3, 31.8, 30.9, 29.5, 29.4, 29.2, 26.9, 22.6, 14.0. (The observation of three carbonyl carbon resonances and two more aromatic carbon peaks than expected based on the highest possible molecular symmetry is consistent with previous work on perylene diimides using similar swallow-tailed N-substituents and has been attributed to restricted rotation about the N–Calkyl bonds.59 Three alkyl carbons were not observed, presumably due to overlap.)

C11PDI monomer (700 mg, 0.77 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous dichloromethane (15 mL) under N2 and “first generation” Grubbs initiator (12.6 mg, 0.015 mmol) in dichloromethane (1 mL) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred for 5 h until all the monomer was consumed (as monitored by TLC), and then ethyl vinyl ether (0.2 mL) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred for another 5 h before it was added to methanol (200 mL) dropwise; the resulting red precipitate was filtered, washed with methanol, and dried under vacuum. The resultant solid was then dissolved in dichloromethane (25 mL) and added to methanol (200 mL) dropwise. The precipitate was filtered, washed with methanol, and dried under vacuum. The red solid was then washed with hot methanol in a Soxhlet apparatus for 6 h, and then with hot acetone overnight. Finally, CHCl3 was used to extract the materials for 5 h. The chloroform extracts were concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue was precipitated by dropwise addition to methanol (200 mL).

The reaction mixture was stirred for 5 h until all the monomer was consumed (as monitored by TLC) and ethyl vinyl ether (0.2 mL) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred for another 5 h before it was added to methanol (150 mL), dropwise, and the resulting black precipitate was filtered, washed with methanol, and dried under vacuum. The resultant solid was then dissolved in dichloromethane (5 mL) and added to methanol (200 mL) dropwise. The precipitate was filtered, washed with methanol, and dried under vacuum. The red solid was then washed with hot methanol in a Soxhlet set-up for 6 h, and then with hot acetone overnight. Finally, CHCl3 was used to extract the materials for 5 h. Most of the solvent was removed under vacuum, and the residue was precipitated into methanol (200 mL) dropwise. After filtration, the black solid was dissolved in THF and size-exclusion chromatography column (S-X1 Biobeads, 1.2 meter long, ca. 6 cm in diameter) was used to purify the polymer with THF as eluent. The first black band was collected and the solvent was removed. The resultant solid was dissolved in CHCl3 (4 mL) and added to methanol (120 mL) dropwise; the black precipitate was collected by filtration and dried under vacuum to give N-PDI HP as a black solid (221 mg, 57%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ 9.5 (sb, 1nH), 8.5–7.0 (m, 6nH), 5.0 (sb, 2nH), 4.5–3.7 (m, 6nH), 3.2–1.5 (m, 18nH), 1.5–1.0 (m, 80nH), 0.83 (sb, 12nH).

Field-effect transistors
Top-contact OFETs were fabricated on heavily doped n-type silicon substrates (resistivity < 0.005 Ω cm, wafer thickness ca. 500 μm, Silicon Quest Int.) that also serve as gate electrodes with 200 nm thick thermally grown SiO2 as the gate dielectric. Ti/Au (10 nm/100 nm) metallisation on the backside of the substrate was performed to enhance the gate electrical contact. Firstly, the substrates were cleaned by O2 plasma for 3 min to ensure the film adhesion by increasing the hydrophilicity of the SiO2 surface. The SiO2 dielectric surface was then passivated with a thin buffer layer of a bisbenzocyclobutene (BCB) derivative (Cyclotene™, Dow Chemicals), to provide a high-quality hydroxyl-free interface: a 1:20 weight ratio solution of BCB in 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 1 min to provide a very thin, uniform layer (thickness was not measured, final capacitance density was measured). The samples were annealed at 250 °C for 1 h inside a nitrogen glove-box to thermally cross-link the BCB layer. The total capacitance density (COX) was measured using parallel-plate capacitors as 13.86 nF cm−2. A thin layer of PDI polymer was then formed on the substrates by spin coating at 1000 rpm for 60 s from a solution prepared in chlorobenzene (15 mg mL−1), while avoiding exposure of the devices to the ambient environment. Calcium (ca. 150 nm) electrodes were deposited through a shadow mask to act as source and drain electrodes.
Photovoltaic cells
Each solar cell was fabricated using a blend of one of the homopolymers with P3HT (Rieke Metals, 4002-E) as the active layer. ITO-coated glasses (Colorado Concept Coatings LLC, sheet resistivity of ca. 15 Ω per sq.) were used as the substrates for the solar cells. The substrates were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath of detergent water, rinsed with deionised water, and then cleaned sequentially in ultrasonic baths of deionised water, acetone, and isopropanol. Nitrogen was used to dry the substrates after each of the last three baths. A 300 nm-thick layer of SiOx was deposited on the cleaned ITO by e-beam deposition (AXXIS, Kurt J. Lesker) to pattern the anode. Next, the substrates were ultrasonicated in isopropanol for 15 min, blown dry with nitrogen, and air-plasma treated for 2 min. A hole-conducting layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene:poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, CLEVIOS P VP AI 4083, H. C. Starck) was filtered through a 0.45 μm-pore PVDF filter and spin-coated on the substrates at 5000 rpm for 1 min; the substrates were then annealed at 140 °C for 10 min in ambient atmosphere. After loading into a nitrogen-filled glove box, solutions of a PDI polymer and P3HT in chlorobenzene (1:1 weight ratio, 20 mg mL−1, filtered through 0.2 μm-pore PTFE filters) were spin-coated onto the substrates for 1 min at speeds of 1000–1500 rpm. The substrates were then loaded into a vacuum thermal evaporation system (SPECTROS, Kurt J. Lesker) connected to the glove box, and ca. 200 nm of Al was deposited through a shadow mask at a rate of 1–3 Å s−1 and a base pressure of ca. 7 × 10−8 Torr to define the cathodes. The completed devices were transferred in a sealed container to another nitrogen-filled glove box for electrical measurements. Current–voltage characteristics were measured using a source meter (2400, Keithley) controlled by a LabVIEW program. When testing the solar cells under illumination, filtered light from a 175 W Xenon lamp (ASB-XE-175EX, CVI) was used as a broadband light source to simulate sunlight: the irradiance used were 89, 79, and 74 mW cm−2 for devices using C11PDI HP, C7PDI HP, and NPDI HP, respectively. A monochromator and calibrated photodiode were used to measure IPCEs.

In the case of C11PDI, 1H NMR spectroscopy was also used to monitor the polymerisation, showing it to take place over the course of a few hours. The 1H NMR data also indicate that the polymerisation is first order in monomer (see SI, Fig. S1†) as is typical for Ru-initiated ROMP (see ref. 22).

UV-Vis absorption spectra of the reaction mixture suggest a longer reaction time (ca. 3 h instead of 1.5 h) leads to lower yield of D and the formation of the parent PDI without bay substitution; this phenomenon has previously been described in literature, but the mechanism for this conversion is unclear.
It is worth noting that size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), which was carried out using cross-linked polystyrene beads, was required to remove a small amount of N-PDI monomer residue (not detectable in the 1H NMR spectrum but detectable from thin-layer chromatography) that was found to be present after the Soxhlet extraction.

The electrochemical gap, Ee-chem = e(E1/2+/0 − E1/20/−), of 1.78 eV for N-PDI is similar to its optical gap (1.76 eV), obtained from the absorption onset (or to that of the polymer), suggesting solvation of the ionic species in the electrolyte solution more-or-less cancels the effects of exciton binding.
