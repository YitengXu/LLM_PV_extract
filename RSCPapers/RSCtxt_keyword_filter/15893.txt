    , Accepted 7th February 2019First published on 11th February 2019AbstractMethylammonium lead halide perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) films, with high PbI2 concentration, were grown by the two-step spin coating method. The influence of the precursor concentration and annealing time on the optical and structural properties of the perovskite films was analyzed by optical absorption, photoluminescence, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that, in addition to the CH3NH3PbI3 and PbI2 phases, intermediate phases, such as (MA)2(DMF)2Pb3I8, were formed in the films, depending on the time and temperature of annealing, which can tune the optical absorption in the visible spectra. This intermediate phase induced the formation of perovskite nanowires, identified by SEM images, and their growth may be associated with the presence of the DMF solvent remaining in the PbI2 film.
1. Introduction
The use of organic–inorganic halide perovskites with the general formula ABX3 (A = CH3NH3+, HC(NH2)+; B = Pb2+, Sn2+; X = I−, Br−, Cl−) as light absorbers was first reported in 2009, in a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.8%.1 Since then, research about these materials has increased due to their optical and electronic properties, i.e., gap tunability, large absorption coefficient, high carrier mobility and long diffusion length,2 and, as a result, a PCE of 22% has already been obtained.3,4 The low cost of precursors materials and the solution processability at low temperatures5 make perovskites attractive for electro-optical applications, including photovoltaic devices,6 light-emitting diodes,7 solid-state memory,8 and photodetectors.9
Despite the great efficiency results of the CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) system in solar cells, recent studies have shown that this system presents low stability, which hinders its commercial application.10 Therefore, studies on the formation process of perovskite and its degradation have been approached, aiming at a better understanding of the phenomena occurring in the interaction between the precursors PbI2 and CH3NH3I (MAI), which can lead to the formation of a variety of structures covering the organic element, lead, iodine and solvents.11
The perovskite formation by the two-step spin coating method occurs by the breakdown of the 2D PbI2 network as a result of the interdiffusion of MAI, accompanied by the reorientation of the CH3NH3+ (MA+) cations for the consequent formation of the 3D MAPbI3 structure.12 In a hybrid perovskite, the organic ion MA+ can move inside the vacancy located between the octahedrons of PbI64−, and the spacing between the inorganic layers may vary according to the occupation and orientation of these organic cations.13 Thus, the CH3NH3+:PbI2 ratio plays an important role in the sharing degree of the halogens, which in turn determines the structural arrangement.14 Another aspect to be considered in perovskite synthesis is the choice of solvents and their concentrations. The effect of different solvents, such as dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO), γ-butyrolactone (GBL), and dimethylformamide (DMF), is related to their different coordination degrees with the precursors.15 Some authors have noted that the PbI2 precursor solution can be composed of iodoplumbate PbIn2−n (n = 2–6) complexes coordinated in different degrees with solvents.16–18 The [PbI6]4− units can form 3D, 2D, 1D, or even 0D networks, depending on the sharing of iodine at the corners of octahedral units, and these different architectures have different optical properties, stoichiometry and structural arrangements.11 Thereby, the perovskite formation depends on the type and amount of these complexes present in the solution. This context favors the appearance of intermediate phases, depending on the concentration of precursors and solvents, which may reduce the fast crystallization between PbI2 and MAI.5 Intermediate phases, generally undesirable for optical applications, may be present during perovskite formation under different processing routes, which govern the crystallization kinetics and the final morphology of the film.19 The influence of the DMF solvent on the formation of intermediate phases during perovskite crystallization has been analyzed using the one-step spin coating method.20,21 It has also been observed that PbI2 films immersed in MAI solution containing a mixture of DMF and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) can produce different intermediate phases, depending on the concentrations of MAI and the annealing temperature.22
In this report, PbI2-rich CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films were produced by the two-step spin-coating method, and the effects of the annealing time and precursor stoichiometry were analyzed in view of the optical and structural properties. Intermediate phases were observed in these perovskite films when the first annealing step (PbI2 film) is not fully effective. This work shows that the optical absorption of the intermediate phases can be tuned in the spectral region between 550–620 nm, depending on the MAI/PbI2 ratio or the annealing time.
2. Experimental section
All CH3NH3PbI3 films were formed using two-step spin-coating deposition. The substrates (microscope glass) were first cleaned by ultrasonication in aqueous solution containing detergent and distilled water for 10 minutes, and then rinsed with deionized water. The next cleaning step consisted of immersing the substrate in a solution of isopropyl alcohol, followed by ultrasonic bath for 10 minutes. After that, 75 μL of PbI2/DMF solution (1 M) at 70 °C was spin-coated onto the glass substrate at 3500 rpm for 30 s. Some PbI2 films were dried at room temperature while others were annealed at 100 °C, both for 10 minutes. Then 75 μL of MAI/IPA (with concentrations ranging from 0.13 M to 0.50 M) was spin-coated on top of the dried PbI2 layer at 3500 rpm for 30 s, and then annealed at 100 °C for 10 minutes. Commercial PbI2 powder (99%), methyl-ammonium iodide powder (98%), DMF solvent (99.8%) and IPA solvent were purchased from the Sigma-Aldrich (Brazil) company.
The morphology of the perovskite film was studied by scanning electron microscopy (EVA MA 15). The crystal phase was obtained with X-ray diffraction (X′Pert PRO MPD), using Cu-kα radiation (λ = 0.15405 nm). The XRD patterns were collected in a symmetric configuration in the 2θ range of 10°–60°, using a step angle of 0.05°, step time of 2 s, operating at 40 kV tension and 30 mA current. The optical properties of the films were characterized by a UV-Vis CCD spectrophotometer (BRC112E – BWTEC Inc), using a 100 W xenon lamp for optical absorption measurements, and a 405 nm diode laser with 100 mW power for photoluminescence measurements. The average thickness of the films was obtained by a Bruker DektakXT profilometer.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 presents the absorption spectra of the films, which were recorded according to the sequence of deposition of the precursor solutions onto a glass blade, with subsequent thermal annealing in a vacuum environment. The optical absorption spectrum of PbI2 film (black line) presents absorption bands at 388 nm, 460 nm and 495 nm. It is known that PbI2, which absorbs at 330 nm, undergoes complexations in the presence of an excess of iodine ions, producing soluble compounds, such as: PbI3− (370 nm); PbI42− (425 nm) and higher coordination species.18 The coordination of lead takes place with the competition between solvent molecules (S) and iodide ions, which consequently determines the species in the precursor solution and in the films, where complexes like iodoplumbate intermediates PbIn2−n (n = 2–6) and PbIS5+; PbI2S4; PbI3S3−; PbI4S22−; PbI5S23−; and even (Pb2I4)n chains may be present.17 It has also been reported that the PbI2 solution contains colloidal dispersions, formed by [Pb–I]n complexes.23 The absorption bands of some of these species are represented in the graph by dashed vertical lines. Furthermore, an absorption in the region between 520 and 630 nm of the PbI2 film spectrum is observed, but, to the best of our knowledge, there are no reports of its origin in the literature. According to Stamplecoskie et al.,18 there is a balance between the multiple halogen complexes in solution, these being kinetically unstable. Thus, there may be higher-order complexes, with different coordination degrees in the solution, which the scientific community has not isolated or identified yet.
 Fig. 1  Optical absorption spectra: PbI2/DMF (1 M) film, dried at room temperature for 5 minutes (black line); the same PbI2 film, after spin coating of MAI/IPA (0.25 M) at room temperature, without heat treatment (red line); film (4:1) PbI2/MAI after 15 minutes of annealing at 110 °C (green line). The heat treatment was carried out inside a cryostat chamber under vacuum. The absorption bands of the species are represented by a dashed vertical line. All layers were spin coated at 3500 rpm for 30 seconds (average thickness of 358 nm). The inset in the upper right corner, represents the PbI2 film (yellowish color) that generated the black curve, and the PbI2/MAI film (reddish brown color) that generated the red curve. 
The inset of Fig. 1 shows that, after the spin coating of the 0.25 M MAI/IPA solution on top of the PbI2 film at 3500 rpm for 30 seconds, there was a change in the film color from yellow to reddish brown, during centrifugation, indicating that the transformation of the precursors in the perovskite begins during the centrifugation process. The rapid reaction between PbI2 and MAI, even before the heat treatment process, has already been reported.24 The optical absorption spectrum of the freshly centrifuged film confirms the formation of the perovskite phase during centrifugation, characterized by absorption at 760 nm, which is commonly attributed to the characteristic transition involving the valence band (BV) and the conduction band (BC) of perovskite CH3NH3PbI3.25 In addition to the CH3NH3PbI3 crystallization, after the MAI deposition, a pronounced absorption band from 530 to 750 nm is observed. This absorption band, comprised of PbI2 complexes and perovskite characteristic absorptions, has been debated in the scientific community and is still an open subject.17,18,26–28 It was also observed that the absorption bands at low wavelengths (<520 nm) had a gain of intensity after the deposition of the MAI, although they retained the same spectral features exhibited by the PbI2 film, indicating the presence of complexes of [PbIxn−] remaining in the film, which did not react for perovskite formation. On the other hand, after the thermal annealing of the CH3NH3PbI3 film at 110 °C for 15 minutes, carried out inside a cryostat chamber under vacuum, there is an increase in absorption spectra in the region from 500 to 620 nm, and a 10 nm blue-shift of the perovskite absorption. Even with the heat treatment, absorption features at low wavelengths remain unchanged.
In order to investigate the annealing effects on the dynamics of the PbI2/MAI film transformations, XRD and SEM measurements were performed after the MAI centrifugation step, with different annealing times (Fig. 2). It should be highlighted that, in this case, the PbI2 layer was not subjected to annealing prior to the MAI deposition, in order to observe the solvent interactions.
 Fig. 2  X-ray diffraction patterns (A) and respective SEM images (B) of (4:1) PbI2/MAI films as a function of the annealing time at 100 °C on a hot-plate. The inset of figure (A) represents the relative intensity between the PbI2 peak at 12.6° (IPb) and the perovskite peak at 14.17° (IPerov), as a function of the annealing time. 
Before the annealing of the PbI2/MAI film (0 min), the XRD pattern shows three phases: the hexagonal PbI2 crystalline phase, characterized by diffraction peaks located at 12.6°; 25.5°; 38.6° and 52.3° relative to the planes (001); (002); (003) and (004),11,29,30 respectively; the tetragonal perovskite phase, whose diffraction peaks are located at 14.17° (110), 28.49° (220), 43.27° (330),27 31,86° (310) and 43,19° (314);29 and the recently discovered orthorhombic crystal phase of the (MA)2(DMF)2Pb3I8 system, which has diffraction peaks at 10.24° and 11.42°.22 As reported by Petrov et al.,22 this (MA)2(DMF)2Pb3I8 crystalline phase is formed at high PbI2 concentrations, and it decomposes into two other phases: MAPbI3 and PbI2, after thermal treatment. As can be seen in Fig. 2A, the peak intensity of MAPbI3 and PbI2 increases with the annealing time, corroborating with the increase of these two structure phases, in detriment with the dissociation of the intermediate phase (MA)2(DMF)2Pb3I8. The inset of Fig. 2A shows the relative intensity of PbI2 (12.6°) and perovskite (14.17°) as a function of annealing time. The ratio between the phases before annealing is similar. However, the PbI2 proportion increases and stabilizes after twenty minutes of annealing. This behaviour shows that the decomposition of the intermediate phase generates more PbI2 than MAPbI3. According to the optical absorption data, the diffraction pattern confirms the existence of PbI2 and perovskite phase in the unannealed film, and confirms that the annealing process employed was not sufficient to promote the complete transformation of the PbI2 complexes into a perovskite structure, under PbI2 excess conditions.
An intermediate phase of PbI2/MAI/DMF has already been reported by Guo et al.,2 who proposed that it arises due to the CH3NH3+ intercalation in the inorganic network during solvent evaporation. The addition of MAI weakens the interaction between DMF and PbI2, since the organic component is located in a closer position to the PbI2 network. The organic/inorganic alternate stacks are organized at a high orientation degree due to ionic interactions between CH3NH3+ and the octahedrons of PbI6−, while van der Waals interactions occur in the organic chains of the molecular layer. Such structures, composed of alternating layers, remain in two-dimensional confinement owing to the steric effect. Two-dimensional alternated layers with the generic formula A2MX4 have already been reported.31 The 2.5 dimensionality was reported to be a double inorganic layer intercalated with the organic layer containing the formula A2(MA)2–Pb2I7.11
Studies about solvent engineering show the role of the DMF solvent in changing the perovskite structure from 3D to 1D MAPbI3.22 It shows that the addition of DMF during the second deposition step dissolves the pre-deposited PbI2 film and acts as a preferential site for the reaction with MAI, leading to a one-dimensional growth. In a given amount of DMF, the MAI concentration determines the structure of nanowires.32 It was also been reported that the contact of IPA with the PbI2-DMF film induces PbI2 to precipitate immediately, since the extraction of DMF by IPA will drastically increase the supersaturation degree of PbI2.33 It is important to report that the crystallization of perovskite in nanowire structures requires the presence of intermediate phases, which act as structural directing agents.34 Thus, the morphological characteristic of the intermediate phase is of a great importance for the morphology of the perovskite film.

Fig. 2B shows the scanning electron microscopy images of the PbI2/MAI samples submitted to different annealing times, at 100 °C. The unannealed film (0 min) is formed by small nanorod structures, well distributed over the glass surface. With a short annealing time (10 minutes), the length and diameter of these nanorods increase, as well as the length/diameter ratio, leading to quasi-nanowire structures. As the morphology of the (MA)2(DMF)2Pb3I8 intermediate phase is needle-like, as reported by Petrov et al.,35 nanowires were expected at the final phase of the perovskite film. The 1D growth characteristic formed by the bonding of grains was explained by Yan et al.,14 as a result of colloidal growth, composed of overlapping planes of PbI2 intermediates in the (100) direction, and which are linked by the sharing of halogens. After 20 minutes of annealing, the film changes drastically its morphology, leaving the quasi-1D format of the intermediate phase, to show a structure composed of spherical shape aggregates. As the film is annealed for 30 minutes, there is an increase in grain size, with generation of holes, consequently decreasing the surface coating, similar to what occurs in a sintering process.
Some articles discuss the colloidal formation of nanowires from the initial interaction of PbI2 with DMF, and the influence of MAI on crystal growth.14,32 PbI2 dissolved in DMF is ordered in the (001) planar direction due to the weak van der Waals interactions between the (001) planes, and then coordinates with DMF to break some chemical bonds inside the (001) layer for complete dissolution. When CH3NH3I is added to the PbI2 solution, it is prone to precipitate due to dissolution competition with MAI. It is the MAI that will selectively coordinate with the PbI2 at the edge of this (001) plane due to outstanding connections on these sites. Thus, this selective coordination mode allows the MAI to act as a surfactant at this stage, to form colloidal PbI2 nanowires. These nanowires are stacked in the (001) plane, and attach together in the form of nanowire bundles through halogen sharing. An increase in the amount of organic component turns the MAI solution into a solvent, which dissolves the precipitated PbI2 colloid and coordinates it back toward a tetragonal form for maximum coordination, making the 1D morphology decrease and disappear, as layers of hexagonal disks become observable, with the MAI inserted in the interlayers of (001) PbI2via a coordination reaction. An increase in the content of the organic component will enter the non-selective coordination mode, causing the size of the colloids to decrease and produce smaller perovskite crystals.14 Therefore, we believe that the blue-shift of the perovskite absorption from 760 to 750 nm, generated by annealing (Fig. 1), may be associated with the size change of perovskite nanowires, since the decrease in the size of the nanowires can increase the quantum confinement of the perovskite films, where the annealing time leads to structures with different particle sizes. Recent results show that the size variation of perovskite nanoplatelets can tune the optical absorption of these nanomaterials from 430 to 520 nm.34,36,37

Fig. 3A and B show the absorption spectra of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films with different precursor concentrations (PbI2 and MAI), before and after the thermal annealing of the second step, respectively. In this analysis, all films were subjected to annealing at 100 °C for 10 minutes after the first deposition step (PbI2 film). In Fig. 3A, analyzing from the lowest PbI2 concentration (0.5 M) and following the sequence of increasing MAI concentration, it is observed that the MAI (0.13 M) sample shows the absorption of perovskite at 760 nm, and a prominent absorption at low wavelengths, which are characteristic of the PbI2 complexes and other intermediate states, as evidenced in Fig. 1. Overall, as the MAI concentration increases, an increase in optical absorption (OA) intensity, for wavelengths ≥520 nm, is observed until a certain MAI concentration (0.25 M). For the high MAI concentration, a rapid decrease in absorption intensity is observed. In addition, the increase in MAI concentration shifts the PbI2 complex absorption peaks for longer wavelengths. When the PbI2 concentration increases from 0.5 M to 1.0 M, it is observed that, in general, both the absorption intensity of perovskite and PbI2 complexes increases, and the red-shift of the PbI2 complexes intensify. For low PbI2 concentration, low concentrations of MAI are sufficient to bind to PbI2 and form the perovskite structure. With the increase in PbI2 concentration from 0.5 M to 1 M, it is observed that more MAI content is required to stabilize the bonds with PbI2 for perovskite crystallization. The effect of MAI concentration on the annealed films (Fig. 3B) showed similar spectral behaviour to the unannealed film (Fig. 3A), in terms of the red-shift of the PbI2 complexes with the increase in MAI concentration. However, in relation to the absorption intensity, some changes were observed with the [MAI]:[PbI2] ratio and the annealing process. As noted, at low wavelengths, the absorbance of the annealed (1.0:0.25) sample is above the absorbance of the annealed (1.0:0.31) sample. As shown in Fig. 3, the annealing of the (1.0:0.31) sample resulted in a decrease in the absorption intensity at low wavelengths (up to 565 nm), where the absorptions of the [Pb–I]n complexes are present, as shown in our work by Fig. 1. Since the multiple halogen complexes in solution are kinetically unstable, the annealing process may have dissociated those into lower-order complexes, such as PbI2, since other regions of the spectrum have not undergone changes in their absorption intensities. It is known that the DMF solvent has the ability to compete with I− for coordination sites around Pb2+ and consequently suppress the formation of iodoplumbates.38 It's also known that PbI53− and PbI64− formation is important to perovskite formation.17,38 Therefore, the occurrence of PbI2/DMF complexes makes perovskite crystallization difficult. Hamill et al.,38 showed, recently, a red-shift of the OA peak, from 368 nm to 425 nm as the [MAI]:[PbI2] ratio increases in DMF solution. This OA shift is due to the decreasing of the PbI3− OA intensity while the OA intensity of the PbI42− increases. This result shows that iodide of the organic compound can coordinate with PbI2 to form iodoplumbate intermediate PbIn2−n (n = 2–6) complexes in solution. Thus, the red-shift of the OA peak with increasing of the MAI concentration, observed in Fig. 3, may be associated with the presence of iodide plumbate ions containing a higher number of iodine ions and intermediary complexes with DMF solvent. Rahimnejad et al.,17 have shown a red-shift in the absorption band due to the presence of iodide plumbate ions containing a higher number of iodine ions as temperature is increased. This results is consistent with DFT calculations, where the Gibbs free energies for successive replacement of solvent molecules by iodide, to obtain plumbates with a higher number of iodide ions, is an endergonic process that requires energy.17 Then, the plumbate species with a high content of iodide ions is favored for higher temperatures.
 Fig. 3  Optical absorption spectra of perovskite films with different stoichiometric ratios between the precursors PbI2 and MAI, before the annealing step (A), and after annealing at 100 °C for 10 minutes on a hot-plate (B). In this case, before MAI deposition, the PbI2 film was also annealed at 100 °C for 10 minutes. (C) Energy diagram scheme of the different species present in the material associated with the normalized absorption and photoluminescence spectra of PbI2 and perovskite films. 

Fig. 3C shows a schematic representation of the energy diagram for the different species present in the material, which shows bands related to PbI2 complexes, intermediate states and the perovskite structure, and also shows the absorption and photoluminescence spectra of the PbI2 and perovskite films, associated with this energy diagram. The scheme shows that, when a 405 nm diode laser (3.06 eV) is applied to the perovskite film, electrons are excited from the ground state to the top of the PbI42− states. Electrons, through non-radiative processes, relax until reaching the bottom of the perovskite conduction band, undergoing a radiative decay process and emitting photons with an energy of 1.63 eV (760 nm). It is noted that both the PbI2 complexes and the intermediate phases do not exhibit photoluminescence.

Fig. 4 shows XRD patterns and SEM images of perovskite films with MAI concentrations ranging from 0.13 M to 0.50 M, while the PbI2 concentration is 1 M. Both the PbI2 film (first deposition step) and PbI2/MAI (second deposition step) were annealed on a hot plate at 100 °C for 10 minutes. The low concentration MAI film (0.13 M) contains a homogeneous morphology composed by uniform apparently spherical grains, were the PbI2 and perovskite phases coexist. As the concentration of MAI increases to 0.38 M, there is a drastic decrease of the PbI2 phase, against an increase of the perovskite phase. Herewith, a non-uniform increase in grain size can be observed. At the same time, there is the appearance of another phase, which has diffraction peaks at 11.46°; 11.55°; 26.42°; 31.6°; and 33.8° that was identified as a dihidrated (CH3NH3)4PbI6·2H2O intermediate phase.2,39,41 Pellegrino et al.,11 under an MAI-rich condition (1PbI2:3MAI), identified peaks at 11.45° and 34.9° which were assigned to an intermediate phase with an alternate layered structure of PbI2 and CH3NH3+, which maintains the orientation of the PbI2 initial layer. In the literature, the assignment of the peak at 11.46° is not unanimous. This peak has already been associated with a low-dimensional perovskite phase with the formula MA4PbI6,40 as well as the dihydrate phase MA4PbI6–2H2O.39,41 We can also observe that the XRD peaks at 11.46° and 26.42° increase as the MAI concentration increases. This corroborates with the presence of the dihydrate (CH3NH3)4PbI6·2H2O intermediate phase, because it can form readily in film growth under ambient conditions, in an excess of MAI in the perovskite film, due to the hygroscopic nature of MAI.41 The increase in MAI concentration to 0.50 M, not only eliminates the PbI2 phase of the film, but also induces both the increase of this intermediate phase and a slight decrease in the intensity of the perovskite phase; this fact, is accompanied by a sudden change in the morphology of the film, where there is a predominant increase in the grain size, as well as the formation of large conglomerates of material with a very different texture. This uniformity loss at high MAI concentrations may be the reason for the absorption intensity drop shown in Fig. 3. The results show that the increase of an organic component in the film tends to favor the formation of the intermediate phase, under competition conditions, in relation to the perovskite formation. Thus, we believe that the absorption present in the range of 550 to 650 nm in the spectra of Fig. 1 and 3, for CH3NH3PbI3 films with a high degree of organic component, is associated with intermediate states of perovskite like ((MA)2(DMF)2Pb3I8), dihidrated (CH3NH3)4PbI6·2H2O or other complexes of PbI2–MAI–DMF. As observed, different intermediate states may be formed, depending on the processing conditions, such as temperature and concentration of the precursors. Fig. 3 shows that the increase in MAI concentration leads to a red-shift of the absorption associated with PbI2 complexes, indicating the formation of the intermediate states.
 Fig. 4  X-ray diffraction patterns (A) and SEM (B) of perovskite films, with different concentrations of MAI (0.13 M; 0.38 M and 0.50 M) over the layer of 1 M PbI2. Both the PbI2 film (first step) and PbI2/MAI (second step) were annealed on a hot-plate at 100 °C for 10 minutes in the ambient environment. 
To intensify the occurrence of the intermediate states, a thicker film (average thickness of 765 nm), containing 1 M PbI2 and 0.25 M MAI, spin coated at 1500 rpm, was produced and analyzed as a function of the annealing time at 100 °C. Fig. 5 shows the optical absorption spectra of this film, obtained in situ, during the annealing process in a vacuum chamber. Here, a blue-shift of the OA peak related to intermediate states toward to PbI2 complexes is observed, contrary to what is observed when there is an increase in MAI concentration.
 Fig. 5  Optical absorption spectra of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film (1 M PbI2:0.25 M MAI) as a function of annealing time at 100 °C in a vacuum chamber. The film was synthesized by using a two-step spin coating method at 1500 rpm for 30 s (average thickness of 765 nm). For this sample, the PbI2 film was annealed at 80 °C for 10 minutes. The abbreviation RT stands for room temperature. 
The spectrum shows that the perovskite absorption at 760 nm has a decreasing intensity throughout the annealing time. The absorption peak, initially located at 627 nm, is progressively shifted to smaller wavelengths, stepping through a shift of 60 nm, until arriving at 567 nm after 145 minutes of annealing. Bi et al.26 observed a gradual increase in absorption intensity in the range of 600–800 nm during the first hour of annealing, along with an increase in crystallinity and grain size of the perovskite. However, after three hours, a small amount of PbI2 phase appeared which may have originated from the perovskite decomposition.
No clear explanation was found in the literature for the origin of the absorption at 627 nm. Rahimnejad et al.17 observed an absorption band at 690 nm, which he attributed as MAPbI3 species in solution. The understanding of this spectrum can be based on the perspective that the lower rpm employed produced a thicker film. Firstly, the annealing of the PbI2 film at 80 °C for 10 minutes may not have been enough for the complete removal of the DMF solvent. After the interaction with the MAI/IPA solution, the transformation kinetics of precursors in the perovskite in a thicker film may have occurred in a different way in relation to a thinner film, since the interdiffusion of MAI in the PbI2 needs to travel longer distances throughout the interior of the material. As the film is thick, the interaction between the precursors and the DMF and IPA solvents may have generated different intermediate structures at different surface distances, which combined, resulting in the absorption at 627 nm. The continuous annealing induces the evaporation of the solvents, dissociating the remaining species, forming more PbIxn− complexes, leading to an absorption decrease in the intermediate region and an absorption increase at smaller wavelengths. In addition to the blue-shift of the perovskite absorption, it can be seen the appearance of a small absorption around 500 nm after 20 minutes of annealing, which may be associated with the formation of PbI2 complexes.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, this study reports the effects of thermal annealing and precursor stoichiometry on the optical and structural properties of PbI2-rich CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films produced by the two-step spin-coating method. After deposition, the PbI2 film presents complexations with different coordination degrees with DMF, leading to a broad absorption band from 330 to 620 nm.
The X-ray diffraction pattern corroborates with the optical analysis, and confirms that the transformation of the precursors into a perovskite structure begins during the spin coating step process, before the thermal treatment process. When adding the MAI/IPA to the PbI2 film, new complexes can be generated such as, for example, the (MA)2(DMF)2Pb3I8 phase. This intermediate phase was observed in our X-ray diffraction patterns, attesting different degrees of interactions between PbI2, MAI and solvents. This intermediate phase is thermally unstable and decomposes into PbI2 and perovskite, and the absorption intensity of the PbI2 and perovskite increases with the annealing time, at the expense of the dissociation of this intermediate phase. This intermediate phase favored the perovskite crystallization in a nanowire structure. The colloidal growth of nanowires suggests that our precursor solutions already exhibited colloidal dispersions and the presence of remaining DMF solvent in the PbI2 film was determinant for the formation of the intermediate phase.
The different stoichiometric ratios of the precursors lead to different phase compositions, morphologies and optical properties of the material. The absorption spectra show variations of intensity and position of absorption as a function of concentration, following a standard behavior, and indicate a limit to the amount of organic component (MAI) that can be incorporated without impairing the quality of the generated film. Thus, the main contribution of this work was to show that solvents play an important role in the coordination kinetics of PbI2 with MAI when synthesized by the two-step spin coating method, especially as the thermal annealing is not completed in the first step. Both the concentration and the annealing modify the structural configuration of these materials and can lead to different intermediate phases such as (MA)2(DMF)2Pb3I8.
Thus, perovskite preparation by a two-step spin-coating deposition mode without a good thermal annealing in the first-step, to eliminate the DMF solvent, can lead to the formation of intermediate states and perovskite nanowires.
