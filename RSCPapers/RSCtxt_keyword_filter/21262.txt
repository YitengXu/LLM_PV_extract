As the key parameter determining PSC performance relies on a bicomponent nanostructured active layer morphology, we investigate the stability of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) thin films composed of preassembled poly(3-hexyl-thiophene) (P3HT) nanowires (NWs) and [6,6]-phenyl-C-71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) under light irradiation. The three-dimensional (3D) morphological changes caused by light-derived chemical oxidation and degradation are visualized and interpreted using 3D transmission electron microscopy combined with photo-physical characterization. Quantitative analysis of the phase separation and percolation pathways for efficient charge transport is performed. Two solution-processed NW-based thin films prepared via crystallization-driven assembly of P3HT in the presence or absence of PC71BM were compared with conventional P3HT/PC71BM blend films in terms of morphological instability against light irradiation. The introduction of pre-assembled NWs with tight packing of P3HT in thin films with PC71BM reduces the morphological degradation of BHJ thin films.
The morphological and structural features of organic thin films composed of p- and/or n-type materials play a critical role in charge generation, separation and transport,1–3 and the subsequent performance of optoelectronic devices, such as thin film transistors, light-emitting diodes, and photovoltaics.4–7 In particular, a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) as the most interesting active layer system for photovoltaics has been fabricated by deposition of blended electron donor and acceptor components that form a subsequent nanoscale interpenetrating network as the film cures.8–10 The device performance is determined to a large extent by the three-dimensional (3D) organization of the photoactive layer, i.e., the layer where light is absorbed and converted into free electrical charges and its contact with the charge-collecting electrodes.11–13 Therefore, various parameters that affect the morphology, such as the ordering of compounds, domain sizes, domain connectivity, and domain compositions, have been considered to improve the performance of photovoltaics.14 Potential phases within the BHJ network are vertically and laterally separated at a multi-length-scale. More sophisticated design and control of the active layer are needed in addition to engineering the device geometry,15,16 optimizing buffer layers, and using a stable electrode.17–19
Meanwhile, the long-term stability of the active layer morphology on exposure to air, heat, and light is an important issue in the practical use of efficient polymer solar cells (PSCs).20,21 The inherent metastable morphology and degradation imposed by organic materials with strong mobility are critical concerns. In particular, the photo-chemical and -physical degradation of the active layer by penetration of oxygen and water can reduce the well-defined donor/acceptor interfaces by unfavorable aggregation of each component, resulting in deeper trap density for electrons and morphological changes in bicontinuous networks; this can affect the current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF).22–24 However, morphological degradation has not been directly elucidated due to lack of appropriate analysis tools.
Recent advances in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have enabled characterization of structural details at nanometer resolution in all 3 dimensions.25 The series of two-dimensional (2D) projections of the thin film taken by TEM at different tilt angles with respect to the electron beam could provide a reconstructed representative 3D image on the basis of computerized tomography. Since Loos et al.26 demonstrated for the first time how to directly visualize the BHJ morphology in PSCs and to determine the controlling parameters for improving the performance, the spatially resolved thin film using TEM tomography (TEMT) could lead to novel insights into predictive morphology control of electron donor and acceptor materials with intrinsically different physical, electronic, and optical properties. Therefore, 3D visualization of BHJ thin films upon light irradiation could identify the morphological degradation affecting the performance and suggest a useful strategy to achieve long-term stability of the active layer in PSCs.
Meanwhile, solution-processed conjugated polymer nanowire (CP NW)-based photoactive films in PSCs have attracted interest because they do not require post-thermal or solvent-vapor annealing, enabling the roll-to-roll manufacture of flexible devices with large-area production and considerable cost reduction.27–29 For example, crystalline P3HT NWs with a width of ∼10 nm, comparable to the exciton diffusion length, could generate a large p–n interfacial area with energy levels well-matched with those of n-type materials and a well interconnected current network. Since crystalline P3HT NWs exhibit tightly packed π–π stacking, NW-based PSCs could show robust thermal and mechanical stability.29–32 However, the direct evidence of whether P3HT NWs can ensure the air stability of the active layer and device performance has not yet been provided.
In this context, herein we describe the 3D morphological transition of P3HT NW-based photoactive films with [6,6]-phenyl-C-71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) visualized by TEMT when exposed to light. The correlation of chemical degradation and the BHJ morphology in the nanoscale organization of P3HT NWs and PC71BM was investigated to obtain new insights into the long-term stability of PSCs. In particular, the growth of P3HT NWs depending on the presence and absence of PC71BM in solution showed a significant impact on the morphological degradation and stability of the thin films.
A conventional P3HT and PC71BM blend thin film was cast from a chlorobenzene solution.33 The P3HT NW-based blend thin films were prepared in two different ways by growth of NWs before and after addition of PC71BM in m-xylene (Fig. 1a and b and Scheme S1†). The crystallization of P3HT into NWs can be induced by heating the m-xylene P3HT solution and subsequent cooling to room temperature (referred to as the whisker method).34,35 Casting solution 1 of P3HT NWs/PC71BM was prepared by growth of P3HT in the presence of PC71BM, while casting solution 2 was obtained by postmixing of precrystalline NWs and PC71BM. First, UV-Vis spectroscopic studies were performed with P3HT NWs/PC71BM solutions to investigate the aggregation fractions and conjugation length of the P3HT chain within the NWs (0.05 mg mL−1, Fig. 1c). The fraction of aggregated P3HT chains and the degree of exciton coupling within the NW aggregates, which are related to the crystalline quality and the average conjugation length, respectively, were evaluated (Table S3† and Fig. 1d).36–38 In chlorobenzene, absorption spectra displayed a peak at 452 nm, which originated from isolated P3HT chains. However, when the NWs were prepared by the whisker method, vibronic shoulders appeared at 513 nm, 552 nm, and 602 nm, which were assigned to A0–2, A0–1, and A0–0, respectively. The amount of P3HT aggregated chains in solution 1 (35.5%) greatly decreased compared to that produced in solution 2 (44.5%) (Fig. S3 and Table S3†). The extent of exciton coupling between the nearest P3HT chains (free-exciton bandwidth, W) was determined using the intensity ratio of the first and second vibronic peaks, A0–0/A0–1, using the weak interchain coupling framework model developed by Spano.37 The NWs in solution 1 showed a larger W (0.163 eV) than those in solution 2 (0.128 eV, Table S3†). These results indicate that the presence of PC71BM can hamper the crystallization of P3HT in the whisker method. However, TEM images of both solutions 1 and 2 showed successful formation of P3HT NWs. This means that the delicate variation in solution-processing of CP NWs should be investigated because it can lead to different optical–electrical properties of NWs.

The P3HT NWs/PC71BM thin films were prepared on a glass substrate by spin-casting from solutions 1 and 2. Photobleaching was observed under light irradiation with a tungsten halogen bulb array under ambient conditions (Fig. S4†).39 In contrast to the film cast from a conventional P3HT/PC71BM blend solution, the photobleaching of NW-based films was significantly reduced. The blend film of P3HT/PC71BM was entirely bleached with a color change from dark purple to yellowish-brown (Fig. S4a and b†). Note that the tungsten halogen light source is tuned to produce an equal short-circuit current, but UV emission is less than a corresponding 1 sun solar simulator. The morphological change of films upon light irradiation was first investigated by TEM (Fig. S5†). The blend film of P3HT/PC71BM showed large aggregates with a dark contrast against the background after light irradiation. The film cast from P3HT NWs/PC71BM solution 1 displayed moderate aggregate formation with a gray contrast, although the NWs were preserved. Interestingly, the P3HT NWs/PC71BM film 2 formed by preassembled NW solution mixing with PC71BM solution did not show any noticeable changes. Considering the density differences between P3HT crystals (1.1 g cm−3) and PC71BM (1.5 g cm−3), the bright and dark areas could be identified as P3HT crystals and PC71BM-rich domains, respectively. This result suggested that (1) NW-based BHJ thin films have stronger air stability than the conventional thin film and (2) the robustness of the NWs determined by mutual π–π packing of P3HT could affect the morphological stability of photoactive films. However, it is difficult to interpret the complementary movement of both P3HT and PC71BM in a 3D manner that causes morphological degradation of P3HT NWs/PC71BM thin films 1 and 2.
To further corroborate the lateral and vertical morphology changes of NW-based thin films 1 and 2 in detail, TEMT was conducted.26,40,41 A series of TEM images were carefully aligned and used to reconstruct the entire film volume with nanometer-scale spatial resolution using back-projection algorithms. Fig. 2a–f show TEMT images of the conventional P3HT/PC71BM blend film and P3HT NW-based blend films (P3HT NWs/PC71BM 1 and 2). The P3HT/PC71BM film showed a stark contrast in morphology before and after light irradiation. The initial homogeneous P3HT/PC71BM blend films exhibited severe macrophase separation with extensive larger aggregates of each component upon light irradiation (Fig. 2a and b). In 3D volume images, the P3HT-rich and PC71BM-rich phases are color-coded with green and red, respectively. In the xy-slice images, they are coded in gray and black, respectively. The P3HT NWs/PC71BM 1 and 2 films also revealed an interpenetrating network surrounded by continuous PC71BM with a larger p–n interface (Fig. 2c and e). Little difference in P3HT NW contents between the top and bottom was observed (Fig. S7a and c, and Table S4†). The BHJ phase consisting of densely packed NWs was more prevalent at the bottom. However, after light irradiation for 24 h, a clear different morphological change could be observed between NW-based films 1 and 2 (Fig. 2d and f and S6d, f†). Compared to the film of P3HT NWs/PC71BM 2 (Fig. 2f), a larger bunch of PC71BM aggregates and disconnected P3HT NWs were observed in film 1 (Fig. 2d). Also, the morphological degradation involving both large PC71BM aggregation and NW disconnectivity appeared greater at the top surface of the thin film near the light source (Fig. S7b†). Contents of P3HT and PC71BM at both the top and bottom of the films were estimated quantitatively by area calculation of binarized xy-slice images (Table S4†). The P3HT content of films 1 and 2 at the top surface was reduced from 52.1% and 53.2% to 30.6% and 44.5% after light irradiation, respectively. Thin film 1 consisting of P3HT NWs with relatively loose π-stacking between P3HT chains would lead to a large morphological change in air under light.

The PC71BM-rich domains (red for 3D volume and black for xy-slice images) can clearly be distinguished from the P3HT domains (green for 3D volume and gray for xy-slice images). The large-area TEMT images of (a–f) are shown in Fig. S6.† (c and e) The NW-based photoactive films show a bicontinuous interpenetrating network of well-dispersed P3HT NWs and PC71BM molecules before light irradiation.

These morphological changes of BHJ films were explained by investigating chemical degradation on a molecular scale using UV-Vis and Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 2g–j). Fig. 2g and h compare the bleaching of the absorption spectra for the films of P3HT/PC71BM and P3HT NWs/PC71BM coated with chlorobenzene and m-xylene solutions, respectively (thickness of ∼100 nm). The absorbance peak of the conventional P3HT/PC71BM film was decreased and blue-shifted with the disappearance of shoulder peaks upon light irradiation, indicating a large decrease in the average conjugation length by photo-oxidation. This could have originated from the photo-oxidative ring opening of constituent thiophene rings.42 In contrast, NW-based films 1 and 2 exhibited only a slight reduction of photon absorption while maintaining the original shape of the P3HT absorption spectrum. Note that the film of P3HT NWs/PC71BM 1 exhibited stronger absorbance than the film of P3HT NWs/PC71BM 2, even though both films were composed of P3HT NWs (Fig. 2g).
For further insight into the effect of NW crystallinity on the molecular deformation of P3HT by light exposure, which can affect the active layer morphology, the chemical structure of P3HT within the P3HT NWs/PC71BM films was analyzed using Raman spectra (Fig. 2i and j). The conjugated length and crystallinity were estimated by considering two strong CC symmetric (νCC, ∼1454 cm−1) and C–C (νC–C, ∼1387 cm−1) stretching vibrational modes of the thiophene ring of the P3HT backbone.43,44 The peak intensity of the conventional P3HT/PC71BM blend film and P3HT NWs/PC71BM film 1 was reduced noticeably (Fig. 2i), and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) was increased (Fig. 2j). The peak position of νCC was slightly blue-shifted to a higher wave number, indicating a decrease in the conjugation length. The well-ordered P3HT phase changed into a disordered P3HT phase with PC71BM aggregation upon light irradiation.
However, interestingly, P3HT NWs/PC71BM film 2 showed no discernible change of νCC peak position and FWHM after light irradiation (Fig. 2j). This result suggests that the robust mutual interactions of P3HT for obtaining the crystalline NWs offer a higher tolerance to photo-oxidation, which was also confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy (Fig. S8†). The intensity of CO (1739 cm−1), CSO (1253 cm−1), and C–O (1200–1100 cm−1) with oxygen moieties caused by photo-oxidation increased considerably in both the P3HT/PC71BM film and P3HT NWs/PC71BM film 1 after light irradiation.45,46 In contrast, the P3HT NWs/PC71BM film 2 did not show appreciable change. This can be explained by loose packing of P3HT chains within the NWs formed by solution-state crystallization of P3HT in the presence of PC71BM as a cause of strong disordering of P3HT when exposed to oxygen and water (Scheme S1†). This might result in diffusion or migration of PC71BM, forming larger clusters that reduce the persistence of the mixed phase and thus lead to large-scale phase separation of P3HT and PC71BM. Therefore, we concluded that tightly packed CP NW-based films have a stronger morphological stability in air under light than conventional blend films.
To investigate more detailed morphological differences between the photoactive films of P3HT NWs/PC71BM 1 and 2, the domain sizes of each component in lateral and vertical directions, as well as the domain composition, were investigated using subtomograms, as shown in Fig. 3a–d (extracted from Fig. 2c–f). As expected, the crystalline P3HT domain size within film 1 was more significantly reduced than that of 2 upon light irradiation for 24 h. Averaged over 20 subtomograms (Tables S5–S8†), the volume fraction of the crystalline P3HT region within films 1 and 2 was estimated to decrease from 52.8% and 51.7% to 34.1% and 46.2%, respectively (from 10.7 × 105 nm3 and 10.4 × 105 nm3 to 6.9 × 105 nm3 and 9.3 × 105 nm3 for volume; 20.2 × 105 nm3 of total volume, Fig. 3e and Table S9†). The notable feature in film 2 is that the inter-connectivity of the P3HT domain is well retained along the vertical axis even after light irradiation (Fig. 3c and d, S9, and Table S10†). The nanoscale vertical phases of donor and acceptor materials are closely related to efficient transport of free electrons and holes through the continuous percolation pathway toward the corresponding electrodes, leading to the improvement of PSC performance.47 Therefore, the fabrication of NW-based thin films capable of solution processing can provide a useful strategy for enhancing the air stability of the photoactive layer and improving device performance through spontaneous formation of a nanoscale BHJ. Particularly, the use of robust CP NWs formed by strong intra- and intermolecular interactions in the active layer prevents penetration of oxygen and water.

In the as-cast thin films, the crystalline order of the P3HT NW domain affecting the transport of charge carriers was further investigated by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GI-WAXS, Fig. 4, S10, and Table S11†). The edge-on orientation of the layered structure of the P3HT was clearly confirmed in the GI-WAXS patterns of NW-based films 1 and 2 (Fig. S10†). The characteristic (100) peak with a layered d-spacing of 16–17 Å along the out-of-plane direction (qz) and the (020) peak correlated with a π-stacking distance of 3–4 Å along the in-plane direction (qxy) were observed. The (100) d-spacing of both films 1 and 2 slightly increased after light irradiation, which originated from P3HT disordering by photo-oxidation (Fig. 4b). The NW-based films 1 and 2 showed a higher (100) peak intensity with a narrower FWHM than the conventional P3HT/PC71BM film (Fig. 4a), which indicates the presence of tight packing of conjugated chains and a larger crystalline coherence length of (100) stacking in the P3HT.31,48,49 Furthermore, the relative P3HT crystallinity was evaluated using the integrated intensity of the (100) peak.50 As expected, P3HT crystallinity within the P3HT/PC71BM film was decreased after light irradiation (Fig. S10g†), whereas NW-based films 1 and 2 showed less decline in P3HT crystallinity. The decrease in crystallinity was larger in the P3HT NWs/PC71BM 1 film.

(b) Change in the (100) d-spacing and the relative P3HT crystallinity of the photoactive films before and after light irradiation for 24 h. 
To further investigate the device stability of the NW-based thin films against sunlight and to explore its feasibility for application in PSC, inverted PSCs with an ITO/ZnO/PEIE/P3HT:PC71BM or P3HT NWs:PC71BM (1 or 2)/MoO3/Ag structure were fabricated. The evolution of the current density–voltage (J–V) and PSC characteristics is represented as a function of time in Fig. 5 and Table S12,† respectively. Despite the fact that the inverted cell architecture can minimize the deterioration in the device performance caused by the photo-oxidation of CP and the formation of the oxygen-induced traps used, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the device with the P3HT/PC71BM photoactive layer was significantly reduced from 3.20% to 1.93% (40.0% of its initial PCE) after being exposed to sunlight for 40 h. As expected, the PCEs of the devices with the NW-based active layers based on the P3HT NWs/PC71BM 1 and 2 decreased relatively slightly from 3.69% and 3.51% to 2.95% and 2.76% (79.9% and 78.6% of the initial PCEs), respectively. The major reasons for this PCE reduction are the drastic decrease in the JSC and FF (Table S12†). Therefore, it can be concluded that the NW-based active layer can effectively prevent the occurrence of photo-induced chemical and morphological instabilities when compared to the conventional P3HT/PC71BM photoactive film, thus providing the long-term stability of the device.

Conclusions
The photoactive BHJ films consisting of solution-processable, precrystalline P3HT NWs and PC71BM revealed strong morphological stability against light irradiation under air, which is demonstrated by 3D TEM. The conventional blend film of P3HT/PC71BM exhibited undesirable macrophase separation between P3HT and PC71BM, but P3HT NW-based films retained their vertical and lateral morphology with high interconnectivity. The inverted device configuration and the application of various passivation layers have been considered for fabrication of air-stable PSCs. Parallel to these efforts, we should not only develop polymer materials with a high photoconversion efficiency, but also achieve long-term stability even at slightly less efficient photoconversion. Therefore, NW-based active layer fabrication can provide a useful strategy for developing PSCs with enhanced long-term stability using previously reported polymers. The active layer analytical platform using 3D TEM nanotechnology could further provide a deeper understanding of the multi-length-scale and multi-dimensional BHJ morphology that affects device performance and long-term stability.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a and b) Schematic representation of two different premixing and postmixing processes based on precrystalline NWs for preparation of P3HT NWs/PC71BM m-xylene solution; (a) premixing and (b) postmixing solutions are referred to as P3HT NWs/PC71BM 1 and P3HT NWs/PC71BM 2, respectively. (c) Absorption spectra of P3HT NWs and P3HT NWs/PC71BM solutions (m-xylene) compared to those of P3HT solution (chlorobenzene). (d) Calculated free-exciton bandwidth (W, blue square) and fraction of aggregated chains (red circle) of P3HT NWs as a function of mixing method are obtained from the absorption spectra of (a). (e and f) TEM images of P3HT NWs prepared by crystallization-driven assembly in both the (e) presence and (f) absence of PC71BM.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a–f) TEMT images of the photoactive thin films of (a and b) P3HT/PC71BM, (c and d) P3HT NWs/PC71BM 1, and (e and f) P3HT NWs/PC71BM 2 blend films; (a, c, and e) before and (b, d, and f) after light irradiation for 24 h. The PC71BM-rich domains (red for 3D volume and black for xy-slice images) can clearly be distinguished from the P3HT domains (green for 3D volume and gray for xy-slice images). The large-area TEMT images of (a–f) are shown in Fig. S6.† (c and e) The NW-based photoactive films show a bicontinuous interpenetrating network of well-dispersed P3HT NWs and PC71BM molecules before light irradiation. The xy-slice images were extracted from the bottom of the 3D construction. (g) Absorption spectra before and after light irradiation of thin films of P3HT:PC71BM on glass processed from a different mixing method. (h) A plot of the integrated absorption intensity versus the light irradiation time of each film (normalized to the initial (time = 0) value). Raman spectra of (i) thin films before and after light irradiation for 24 h. (j) The peak position and FWHM of CC symmetric stretching mode of P3HT in photoactive films before and after light irradiation.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a–d) Subtomograms representing the morphology of NW-based films (a and b) 1 and (c and d) 2 (a and c) before and (b and d) after light irradiation. The P3HT-rich and PC71BM-rich domains are color-coded in green and red, respectively. (e) Quantification of the crystalline P3HT distribution using the thickness of the layer.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Out-of-plane line cut (qz) profiles from the 2D GI-WAXS patterns of thin films as-cast from P3HT/PC71BM, P3HT NWs/PC71BM 1, and P3HT NWs/PC71BM 2 solutions before and after light irradiation for 24 h. (b) Change in the (100) d-spacing and the relative P3HT crystallinity of the photoactive films before and after light irradiation for 24 h.	 

 	Fig. 5  Representative J–V curves of PSCs with photoactive films of (a) P3HT/PC71BM, (b) P3HT NWs/PC71BM 1, and (c) P3HT NWs/PC71BM 2 measured under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 as a function of exposure time. (d) Changes in the PCE of the PSCs stored in air (humidity 60%; room temperature) with simple encapsulation.
