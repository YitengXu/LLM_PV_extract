In this Feature Article the development of functional fullerenes as (1) acceptors, (2) electron selective layers, and (3) morphology stabilizers for bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells is reviewed. In addition to the standard PCBM based acceptors, a wide variety of newly developed fullerene-derived molecules have appeared in the past few years and started to show very encouraging photovoltaic performance when they were blended with low bandgap conjugated polymers. New fullerene derivatives with proper molecular design can also serve as electron selective interfacial materials and morphology stabilizers for the bulk heterojunction layer, which are essential to improve the interfacial property and long term stability of polymer solar cells. Although there still are many challenges ahead before practical polymer solar cells will arrive in the market place, the research in functional fullerenes deserves to have more attention in order to expedite this development process.Chang-Zhi LiChang-Zhi Li received his PhD degree from Fudan University in 2007 under the supervision of Professor Zhan-Ting Li and Quan-Rui Wang.

1. Introduction
Since the discovery of the C60 in 19851 and the macroscopic production of it by arc vaporization of graphite in 1990,2 researchers have performed vigorous investigations of these symmetric cage-shaped carbon molecules. So far, a wide variety of functional fullerenes have been synthesized,3–5 and their structures6 and properties7,8 have been reported. In the mean time, the problems of high cost and limited availability of fullerenes have also been alleviated by the dramatically increased capacity from industrial production of C60.
The abundant availability of fullerenes has provided the opportunity for extensive investigation of their potential utilities as advanced materials. Functional fullerenes not only can maintain the unique characteristics of pristine fullerenes, such as high electron affinity,9 small reorganization energy,10–12 and superior ability for electron transport,13–17 but also can provide desirable processability. For example, by attaching proper organic addends on fullerenes, one can tune their solubility, energy level, molecular interactions, orientation in the solid state, as well as their surface energy. These merits endow functional fullerenes to be used as the excellent electronic component for organic photovoltaics (OPVs).18–20
In the past two decades,21 OPVs have experienced rapid development because they represent a promising alternative for low-cost renewable energy sources, which combine good mechanical flexibility, light-weight, and ease to process.22,23Polymer solar cells (PSCs) are one of the most intensively studied OPV systems.24,25 The state-of-the-art PSCs adopt a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) layer with a blend of polymer donor and fullerene acceptor sandwiched between a transparent metal oxide, i.e. ITO, and a metal electrode, which can be either in the conventional structure (ITO as anode) or in the inverted structure with reversed electrode polarity (Fig. 1).25,26 Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has already reached ∼7 to 9%.27–31 The device operation mechanism can be briefly described as follows in both conventional and inverted device architectures as shown in Fig. 1: upon photo-excitation of organic semiconductors, excitons are generated and diffuse to the donor–acceptor interfaces, then dissociate into holes and electrons due to the downhill energy gradient, ΔELUMO(D)–LUMO(A), between donor and acceptor semiconductors. The separated charges will then drift under the electric field created by asymmetric electrodes and ultimately be collected by the corresponding electrodes. The idealized band structures are also shown in Fig. 1.

It has been proved that not only the inherent properties of donor and acceptor in the BHJ layer are important,32 but also the electrical contact between the BHJ layer and the electrodes33 is critical in determining the device related parameters, such as short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF), for achieving high PCE. The series resistance (Rs) in a solar cell is attributed to the bulk conductivity from the sum of each functional layer and the contact resistance between them. Ohmic contacts at the organic/electrodes interface and high-mobility organic semiconductors are essential to minimize series resistance and maximize FF. To obtain high Jsc, the D/A materials in the BHJ layer should have optimal charge separation, high charge carrier mobility and balanced charge transport, and Ohmic contact formation at the BHJ/electrode interfaces. Voc can be optimized by simultaneously increasing the gap of ΔELUMO(A)–HOMO(D) and matching the photo-excited quasi-Fermi level of the organic semiconductors (acceptor, EF,e−, and donor, EF,h+) to the Fermi levels of the cathode and anode, respectively. Another important aspect which needs to be considered for PSC devices is long-term stability, which requires stable materials, BHJ morphology, electrodes, and proper encapsulation. With the rapid development of this area, new material design and synthesis are needed in order to generate materials with tailored properties to address these practical device issues.20,32–36
Although functional fullerene derivatives have been widely used, they still need to be optimized in order to be compatible with the rapidly developed polymer donors. Especially, new and efficient chemical approaches are needed to tailor fullerenes with specific or multiple functionalities for solving device concerns either in the BHJ layer or in the material interfaces. In this Feature Article, we highlight the recent development of functional fullerenes through versatile synthetic methodologies, and their photovoltaic application in solar cells with enhanced stability and efficiency. Owing to different applications in PSCs, we divide these functional fullerenes into three categories: (1) acceptors, (2) electron selective layer, and (3) stabilizer and compatibilizer for BHJ morphology. This article will also cover examples of the representative development of functional fullerenes for PSCs.

        Fullerene acceptors
The development of highly efficient fullerene acceptors in a BHJ layer is one of the very challenging tasks for achieving high device performance. An ideal functional fullerene requires proper solubility to be dissolved easily in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, toluene, chlorobenzene, and o-dichlorobenzene. In addition, its energy level needs to be engineered to maximize the ΔELUMO(A)–HOMO(D) to achieve high Voc, while maintaining proper LUMO offset (ΔELUMO(D)–LUMO(A)) to facilitate exciton disassociation.37–42 Other properties such as high charge carrier mobility, right surface energy and good film-formation all need to be considered. In this section we introduce several types of fullerene acceptors and their relevant photovoltaic device properties.
2.1. Methanofullerenes
To date, soluble fullerene derivatives based on 6,6-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and its C70 analogue PC71BM are the most widely used acceptors for current BHJ solar cell research.43,44 The structures and synthetic routes for these compounds are shown in Scheme 1. Pristine fullerene was reacted with diazo compounds at 75 °C in dry ODCB to give [5,6]-open fullerene isomer as the major compound. The methanofullerene was subsequently produced after further refluxing in ODCB or sodium lamp irradiation, to convert the [5,6]-open isomer into the [6,6]-closed isomer. Owing to the polarity of the ester group, PCBM and its multi-adduct derivatives could be separated and purified by silica gel chromatography.

The crystallographic analysis of a PC61BM·PhCl co-crystal revealed that a short fullerene centroid-to-centroid distance of less than 10.13 Å (Fig. 2)45 facilitates charge transport in a densely packed phase. It is also worthy to note that the PCBM film has a surface energy of 30.07 mN m−1. The difference of surface energy with P3HT (16.8 mN m−1) and common organic materials is feasible for phase separation of components.64 The mobility of PC61BM is ∼0.10 cm2 V−1 s−1 measured in a organic thin-film transistor (OTFT) configuration with a thin divinyltetramethyl-disiloxane-bis(benzocyclobutene) (BCB) layer on the SiO2/Si substrate as a dielectric layer.49

The LUMO of PCBM was reported to be between −3.7 eV65 and −4.3 eV.46 The reported values are varied in the literature due to different measurement techniques, either in solution or solid form, with different standards and equations to estimate the values.52,66 To avoid the confusion that may be created by reporting varied energy levels of new fullerene materials, we have correlated the reported LUMO and HOMO of new fullerene acceptors with the PCBM reference molecule measured under the same conditions (set the PCBM energy level as widely accepted LUMO, −4.30 eV, and HOMO, −6.00 eV) (Table 1). One can clearly see that the LUMO of fullerene can be tuned over ∼0.8 eV, from low-lying −4.65 eV of fluorinated phenyl bearing fullerene (PF8) to high-lying −3.82 eV of penta(organo)fullerene 3.

As previously reviewed by Liet al.,20 a large number of methanofullerene and PCBM analogues have been studied trying to further improve their properties for PSCs. New acceptors with a wide range of functional groups attached to methanofullerene have been screened, for instance, aromatic and heteroaromatic rings (i.e.phenyl ring67 and thienyl group68,69), a butyl middle chain,70 an aliphatic chain,71 and a methyl end group72 of ester on the C60 or C70 core of PCBM all have been tested (Scheme 1). Higher fullerene, C84, has also been explored.73 The commonly adapted strategy is to fine-tune the substituents of PCBM to optimize their properties for enhancing overall device performance. Because of the rapid growth of p-type materials with wide to narrow engineered bandgaps, new fullerene derivatives with proper energy levels, mobility, and compatibility are urgently needed to pair with high-performance polymers in order to generate improved performance.

2.1.1 Solubility of fullerene acceptors. 
The functionalization of aliphatic chains onto the fullerene core is an effective way to enhance solubility of the fullerene-based materials. For instance, the change of butyl middle chain and end group of ester do not really affect the electrochemical and optical properties of PCBM but increase their solubility. By changing the methyl ester to butyl, octyl, dodecyl and cetyl ester, Cao et al. have obtained new PCBMs with higher solubility. Photovoltaic properties with the MEH-PPV-based BHJ layer revealed that material with the butyl end group exhibited a PCE of 2.45%, slightly better than that of PCBM (PCE, 2.0%).71Liet al. have systematically optimized the butyl middle chain to propyl, pentyl, hexyl and heptyl chains.70 In addition to the improved solubility, the electron-transporting properties of those materials could also be tuned, for example, the PC61PM (with propyl chain) exhibits a highest space-charge-limited (SCLC) mobility of 2.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the BHJ layer and a better PCE of 3.7%, which is higher than those derived from using PCBM as acceptor (SCLC mobility of 1.3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a PCE of 3.5%). The authors suggested that the change of thin film morphology owing to changing of side chains is the main reason for resulting in different electron mobility and photovoltaic performance. Several thienyl-C61-butyric acid methyl esters (TCBM) and their alkyl-substituted derivatives (TCBM-Cn) have also been studied by Geng et al. PSCs based on using hexyl-TCBM chains exhibit the respectable device performance with a PCE of 4.26% (Jsc = 10.61 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.63 V, FF = 0.64).74

            Troshin
            et al. have conducted a systematic study of the effect of acceptor solubility on the device performance.75 They proposed that the best donor/acceptor pair for depositing the active layer is that which possesses similarly high solubility in solvent. After 27 methano-fullerene derivatives have been systematically studied, it was found that the solubility of fullerene derivatives strongly correlated the nanomorphology of their BHJs with P3HT, which in turn, gave the PCE ranging from 0.02% (for the one with 5 mg mL−1 solubility in CB) to 4.1% (one with 80 mg mL−1 solubility in CB). In CB, the PCBM derivative has an optimal solubility in the range of 30 to 80 mg mL−1, and gave the highest PCE, which is comparable to the maximal solubility of P3HT in 50–70 mg mL−1. By attaching an ethylhexyloxy group on the phenyl ring, the p-EHO-PC61BA can be dissolved in DCB. Wudl et al. found that the application of p-EHO-PC61BA as acceptor in BHJ allowed the interaction with the TiOxbuffer layer, which, in turn, modified the organic–inorganic interface to facilitate charge collection. However, the mobility of p-EHO-PCBA (acid), 1.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, is slightly lower than that of p-EHO-PCBM (ester), 1 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, from OFET devices on SiO2/Si substrates. The PSCs based on the device configuration of P3HT:p-EHO-PC61BA/TiOx showed better photovoltaic performance (PCE = 2.6%, Jsc = 7.69, Voc = 0.64 V, FF = 0.53) than that of P3HT:p-EHO-PC61BM (ester form) (PCE = 2.3%, Jsc = 7.36, Voc = 0.66, FF = 0.48).47


2.1.2 Energy level of fullerene acceptors. 
In addition to the solubility of materials, the energy level of fullerene is a very important parameter that influences photovoltaic device performance. As shown in Table 1, the arising LUMO level of the fullerene derivatives gives a higher Voc, while it does not gives higher PCE, because the LUMO offset between the donor and acceptor is not optimal for exciton separation.
Regarding the knobs available to tune the energy level of fullerene derivatives, substituents with electron-donating (methoxy and methyl thioether) or electron-withdrawing (fluorine) strength slightly influence the electronic structure of the fullerene core.76,77 Hummelen et al. have studied the PCBM analogues with methoxyl substituted phenyl ring, which varied LUMO levels for over ∼85 mV. In addition, the 2,3,4-trimethoxyphenyl-PCBM also possesses good solubility that enables the fabrication of devices with improved Voc.
In addition to the substituent effect on addends, one interesting finding reported by Garcia-Belmonte and Bisquert et al.78 was about the occupancy difference of the density of states (DOS) in the BHJ film from different fullerenes that affected the Voc of PSCs (Fig. 3). Two methanofullerenes, DPM-6 and PCBM, showed identical LUMO level when measured by cyclic voltammetry.79 However, there is a large difference (125 mV) in Voc from the BHJ device made with P3HT blends. The device based on the P3HT:PCBM blend showed a Voc of 0.6 V (PCE = 3.2%, Jsc = 9.05 mA cm−2, FF = 65.5). While, the device based on the DMP-6 gave ca. 0.13 V higher Voc value but a lower PCE of 2.6% (Jsc = 7.52 mA cm−2, FF = 0.51). Electronic carriers will thermalize to lower-lying available levels under irradiation and form a Gaussian distribution that sets the position of the Fermi level. Owing to the reduced crystallinity in solids, DPM-6 exhibited a full occupation of the electronic band. However, the occupancy of PCBM is restricted to the tail of the DOS as probed by impedance and capacitance measurements. The amount and energy distribution of intermediate electronic states (IDOS) below the LUMO level of the acceptor molecules turn out to be determining factors for Voc. This may be a promising direction to further improve the photovoltaic device performance.

Trimetallic nitride endohedral fullerenes (TNEFs) possess up-shifted LUMO levels compared to their C60 analogues.80 However, TNEFs generally show poor solubility. A hexyl chain bearing Lu3N@C80-PCBH provides a 0.28 eV up-shifted LUMO compared to that of PC61BM, and it also has good solubility. When comparing their photovoltaic device performances, both devices showed similar photocurrent and fill factor but the Voc of the Lu3N@C80-PCBH:P3HT based device is 0.26 V higher than the reference devices made with PCBM:P3HT.48
The most straightforward way to upshift the energy level of fullerene derivatives is to decrease the number of π-electrons on the fullerene core. For instance, ∼0.1 eV up-shifted LUMO can be obtained when the 58 π-electron PC61BM was modified to form the 56 π-electron bisPCBM.41 Recently, four new bis-adducts of fullerene-di(4-methyl-phenyl)methano-C60 (DMPCBA), di(4-fluorophe-nyl)methano-C60 (DFPCBA), di(methylphenylmethano)-C60 (MPCBA) and di(phenylmethano)-C60 (DPCBA) were studied by Cheng and Hsu et al. The double functionalized fullerenes effectively raise the LUMO energy levels to ∼0.1 eV compared to PCBM. These compounds are very soluble even without aliphatic chains, amorphous, and thermally stable. The best device which incorporated the P3HT:DMPCBA blend showed a PCE of 5.2% with a very high Voc of 0.87 V (Jsc = 9.05 mA cm−2, FF = 65.5) (Scheme 2).50
 Scheme 2  Representative methanofullerenes showed up-shift LUMO to PCBM. 

Fullerene with more than two addends, like trisPCBM81 and penta-arylated fullerene,61 also have been studied. However, even these fullerene derivatives have much higher LUMO energy levels (∼0.4 eV upshift for pentafullerene) compared to those of PCBM, they only gave very poor PSC device performance when blended with P3HT. One reason is the low LUMO offset between the donor and the acceptor (ΔELUMO(D)–LUMO(A)) which causes insufficient exciton disassociation and low Jsc. Although high Voc (0.76 V) can be obtained, the best PCE of the devices is only 1.08% (Voc = 0.76 V, Jsc = 2.8 mA cm−2, FF = 0.51) owing to low photocurrent generation (please refer to the Penta(organo)fullerene section). On the other hand, significant structural perturbation from multiple steric-hindered addends may hamper the close packing between fullerene/fullerene and fullerene/polymer to deteriorate charge transport and separation. Lenes et al. have studied the LUMO energy level of trisPC61BM which was further raised compared to that of bisPC61BM, but the electron mobility of trisPC61BM is almost 5 orders lower than that of PC61BM.81
In order to obtain materials with higher LUMO while still maintaining high mobility, Li and Jen et al. have recently developed a very small 1,2-dihydromethano (CH2)-modified PC61BM, which possesses a relatively high electron mobility (0.014 cm2 V−1 s−1), one order higher than that of bis-PCBM (0.002 cm2 V−1 s−1) but with a higher LUMO energy level (0.15 eV) than that of PC61BM.49 The structure and synthetic scheme for making this molecule are shown in Scheme 3. 1,2-Dihydromethano-fullerene was prepared through Cu(II)-promoted cyclization of γ-silyl fullerene anion species,53 which followed the general procedure reported for Methano-PC61BM.
 Scheme 3  Synthesis of Methano-PC61BM from pristine fullerene. 
Devices made from the blend of P3HT and methano-PC61BM exhibited better performance and thermal stability than those using PC61BM as acceptor. With a thickness of 110 nm, the P3HT:PC61BM BHJ device showed a PCE of 3.02% (Voc = 0.58 V, Jsc = 7.42 mA cm−2, and FF = 70%). Under the same fabrication condition, a higher PCE of 3.81% was achieved from the P3HT/Methano-PC61BM BHJ (Jsc = 8.03 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.69 V and FF = 0.69). While, the device from P3HT:BisPC61BM exhibited a PCE of 2.26% (Voc = 0.71 V, Jsc = 5.86 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.54).


2.1.3 Thermal properties of fullerene acceptors. 
Small and crystalline molecules like PCBM tend to diffuse and aggregate into larger clusters or crystals in a P3HT based BHJ layer during continuous thermal annealing, resulting in deteriorated device performance and lifetime for PSCs.82 To address this issue, amorphous fullerenes have been developed to improve their BHJ thermal stability. It is worth noting that the Methano-PCBM containing mixture of regioisomers showed amorphous nature in solid, therefore the P3HT/Methano-PC61BM BHJ layer remained homogeneous in devices without deteriorating the PCE and Jsc even after being heated at 150 °C for 250 min. While, the P3HT:PCBM based BHJ layer exhibited severe micrometre-sized aggregates and a decreased photovoltaic performance (Fig. 4). Amorphous bisfunctionalized DMPCBA50 and dihydronaphthyl-based [60]fullerene83 have also been reported to improve the thermal stability of P3HT blends. Jen et al. reported that bulky aromatic groups such as triphenylamine (TPA) or 9,9-dimethylfluorene (MF) could also be used to modify PCBM to become molecular glass with high glass-transition temperatures (TPA–PCBM, Tg = 170 °C; MF–PCBM, Tg = 180 °C; PCBM, Tg = 122 °C) while still maintaining the similar mobility and electronic properties as PCBM. This resulted in devices with comparable photovoltaic performance to PCBM, but much improved thermal stability.67

2.1.4 
            Light absorption of fullerene acceptors. 
The light absorbing property of fullerene derivatives is another important parameter that needs to be engineered. The Ih-symmetrical C60 fullerene has relatively weak absorption of visible light due to its highly structural symmetry, which forbids low-energy transitions. By replacing it with its higher analogue, the D5h-symmertrical C70 has better visible light absorbing capability than C60, which shows a broad absorption peak in the range of 440–530 nm.84 Therefore, the efficiency of BHJ devices based on low bandgap polymers and PC71BM has been significantly improved compared to its C60 analogue. Similarly, the studies of pyrrolidino–pyrazolino fullerene dimers also suggested that C70–C70 homo-dimers can have better photovoltaic performance than their C60 analogues, owing stronger absorption in the visible spectrum. Non-optimized BHJ PSCs with P3HT blends exhibited a PCE of 1.0%.85
However, C70 based materials are much more expensive than their C60 analogues. Recently, several modified PCBM containing light-absorbing dye showed enhanced light absorption and device performance. The ideal materials should possess easy tunability of their energy and absorption to facilitate charge generation and transport. Examples reported by Mikroyannidis et al. use modified-PCBM with cyanovinylene 4-nitrophenyl dye segments, through the further Prato reaction of PC61BM.86–88 It showed a broader and stronger absorption in the visible region between 400 and 750 nm. Their LUMO levels are ∼0.15 eV higher than those of PCBM. The resulting device based on the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:fullerene/Al showed a PCE of 5.32% (Jsc = 10.95 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.76 V, FF = 0.64).

2.2. 
          Indene
fullerenes

Recently, indene fullerenes have been extensively investigated because of the ease of making them in one-pot reactions.89 Several high-performance PSCs have been reported based on their blends with P3HT. For example, Liet al. have demonstrated that soluble indene fullerenes, IC60BA54,90 and IC70BA,55 could have significantly improved Voc and efficiency of devices, owing to their 0.17 and 0.19 eV higher LUMO levels compared to PC61BM. The mono-substituted fullerenes, IC60MA and IC70MA, possess ∼0.05 eV higher LUMO level than PC61BM. Recently, Thompson et al. have further demonstrated high-performance BHJ PSCs based on a ternary blend that contains P3HT, PC61BM, and IC60BA. The Voc of devices could be tuned from 0.61 V to 0.84 V as the fraction of ICBA was increased, while keeping Jsc and FF uniformly high. This is a quite promising approach to overcome the limitation of binary blend PSCs.91
The performance of the PSCs based on P3HT and indene fullerenes is summarized in Table 2. P3HT/IC60BA and P3HT/IC70BA BHJ PSCs reached high PCE of 5.44 and 5.79%, respectively.54 After the P3HT/IC60BA blends being annealed at 150 °C for 10 min, the performance of PSCs further improved to 6.48% (Voc = 0.84 V, Jsc = 10.61 mA cm−2, FF = 72.7%).90Biindene-C60 mono-adduct (BC60MA) and biindene-C60 bis-adduct (BC60BA) can be synthesized easily by reacting 1,10-biindene with C60. Although the devices using BC60MA or BC60BA as acceptor in the P3HT based BHJ showed higher Vocs of 0.68 and 0.82 V, their overall device performances are much lower than those obtained from using IC60BA due to lower Jsc (P3HT/BC60MA: PCE = 2.21%, Voc = 0.68 V, Jsc = 5.41 mA cm−2, FF = 0.60; P3HT/BC60BA: PCE = 0.61%, Voc = 0.82 V, Jsc = 1.92 mA cm−2, FF = 0.43).56 The devices with biindene-C70 monoadduct (BC70MA) as acceptor showed a similar performance as its C60 analogue, BC60MA. By treating with 3% octane-1,8-dithiol as additive, and thermal annealing at 110 °C for 10 min, the performance increased to 3.44% (Voc = 0.64 V, Jsc = 8.02 mA cm−2, FF = 0.67).57

          Indene-PC61BM (IPC61BM) is obtained from the addition of indene to PCBM, which has a 0.12 eV up-shifted LUMO compared to that of PC61BM. The PSC based on P3HT/IPC61BM as active layer showed a higher Voc of 0.72 V and a higher PCE of 4.39%58 while the PSC based on the P3HT/PC61BM active layer only displayed a Voc of 0.58 V and a lower PCE of 3.49%. These results indicate that these tailored indene fullerenes, ICBA and IPC61BM, are better acceptors than PC61BM for the P3HT-based PSCs (Scheme 4).

2.3. 1,4-Di(organo)fullerenes
1,4-Di(organo)fullerene is also an interesting non-methano-fullerene, which can be prepared by careful installation of two identical or hetero-addends onto the 1,4-position of the fullerene core. The broad variety of addend's functionality allows tuning of their properties for 1,4-di(organo)fullerene, such as solubility, energy level, and molecular orientation in solids. 1,4-Di(organo)fullerene also possesses 8 times higher absorption extinction coefficient at 480 nm than that of methanofullerene.52
Nakamura et al. reported that the monoaddition of a Grignard reagent, such as tri(organo)silylmethylmagnesium chlorides, to C60 took place smoothly to produce (organo)(hydro)[60]fullerenes, C60R1H, in up to 93% yield in the presence of dimethylformamide (DMF). The deprotonation of hydrofullerene generated the corresponding anion, which could then be alkylated to afford di(organo)[60]fullerenes, C60R1R2, in 93% yield (Scheme 5). A wide variety of 1,4-di(organo)[60]fullerenes have been made through this two-step synthetic methodology. The representative synthesis of bis(dimethylphenylsilylmethyl)[60]fullerene (SIMEF) is shown in Scheme 5.51
 Scheme 5  Synthetic procedure for SIMEF. 

          SIMEF shows a thermal-driven crystallization from 149 °C to 225 °C, and it adopts a near-hexagonal crystal packing. This 1,4-di(organo)fullerene possesses a ca. 0.1 eV higher LUMO level than that of PCBM. Matsuo, Sato, and Nakamura et al.94 have reported the use of this fullerene as acceptor to establish a solution-based fabrication protocol to blend with a soluble tetrabenzoporphyrin (BP) precursor. As shown in Fig. 5, the three-layered p–i–n photovoltaic device was created, in which the i-layer possesses a well-defined BHJ structure with the formation of vertical columnar BP crystals. The average size of the columns is 65 nm in height and 26 nm in diameter. It is close to an ideal morphology, which facilitates charge separation and transport, since the domain size is very close to the exciton diffusion length (10–30 nm) of organic semiconducting materials.

In this fabrication protocol (Fig. 5), a solution of the donor precursor CP (1,4:8,11:15,18:22,25-tetraethano-29H,31H-tetrabenzo[b,g,l,q]-porphyrin) in chloroform/chlorobenzene was first spin-coated onto the glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS electrode (I) to form II and then thermally converted to form donor BP (red) at 180 °C as a donor p-layer (III). In the second step, a homogeneous mixture (a typical weight ratio of 3:7) of CP and an acceptor SIMEF (blue) in chloroform/chlorobenzene is spin-coated (IV), and CP is converted in situ to BP (red) at 180 °C to form an interdigitated i-layer (V). The p–i–n device showed a very promising PCE of 5.2% (Voc = 0.75 V, Jsc = 10.5 mA cm−2, FF = 0.65). This nanostructured p–i–n device made from a soluble-to-insoluble conversion of materials is a very attractive protocol for achieving high-performance OPV.27
Other types of 1,4-di(organo)fullerenes have been explored as shown in Scheme 6. The performance of devices with either P3HT or benzoporphyrin as donor is summarised in Table 3. Nakamura and Matsuo et al. reported that the three-layered p–i–n device using 1,4-diaryl[60]fullerene, C60(4-PhC6H4)2, as acceptor and BP as donor showed a PCE of 2.3%. The initial AlCl3-mediated Friedel–Crafts reaction of arenes with C60 afforded the hydroarylated C60Ar2H2, which upon deprotonation with t-BuOK and oxidation with CuBrSMe2 yielded 1,4-diaryl[60]fullerenes. These arylated fullerenes generally possess good thermal and chemical stability.95
 Scheme 6  1,4-Di(organo)fullerenes have been studied in OPVs and have been transformed from 1,4-di(organo)fullerene to diastereomerically pure 56π-electron methanofullerenes.

Wudl et al. reported that 1,4-adducts could be obtained through the reactions of 1,4-fullerenol with arenes in the presence of p-toluene sulfonic acid (TsOH). By varying the addends from a strong electron-withdrawing pentafluoro-benzene to a strong electron-donating 1,2,3-trialkyloxy benzene, the LUMO level of these resulting fullerene derivatives changed to ∼0.3 eV (−4.65 eV for PF8 and −4.29 eV for PTHOB). In addition, the LUMO energy of PTHOB/PTPOB is 0.05 to 0.1 V higher than that of PCBM. PSCs made of P3HT:PTPOB (1:,1 w/w) after being annealed at 165 °C for 10 min yielded a PCE of 2.3%. Similarly, the devices made of P3HT:PTHOB (1:1.1, w/w) showed a PCE of 1.2%.

          1,4-Bisbenzyl
          fullerenes can be made through a low-cost, one-pot reaction. The reduction of C60 with potassium (or sodium) mediated by 1-methylnaphthalene in THF at room temperature afforded C602− as a dark red solution. The reaction of the dianion with benzyl bromide afforded 1,4-adduct under a mild condition, in ∼55% yield.96 One interesting study was demonstrated by Cramail et al. that the bis-benzyl fullerene based main chain polymer can be prepared through atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) of 1,4-bis(bromomethyl)benzene intermediate to fullerene. The BHJ solar device using this prototype fullerene polymer acceptor reached a PCE of 1.6% with P3HT as donor.97 It is worthy to note that the first diastereomerically pure 56-π-electron fullerene used for photovoltaic study was obtained through the further functionalization of 1,4-diorgano[60]fullerene, which involved the initial addition of silylmethylmagnesium chloride to 1,4-diorgano[60]fullerene, and then the oxidation of the anionic intermediate to afford the 56 π-electron methano-fullerene (Scheme 6).53
Either in a p–n junction device or in a BHJ solar cell, the diastereomerically pure 56-π-electron fullerene, Methano-BBF, exhibited superior photovoltaic properties than those of 58-π-electron 1,4-fullerene, BBF. The Jsc increased by 1.1 mA cm−2 and the Voc by as much as 0.18 V when a p–n junction device with BP as donor was fabricated. The BHJ device with P3HT as donor and Methano-BBF as acceptor showed a PCE of 3.4% (Voc = 0.82 V, Jsc = 7.1 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.58) while the one with BBF as acceptor showed a PCE of 1.6% (Voc = 0.69 V, Jsc = 4.8 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.49). Under the same conditions, a BHJ device using PCBM showed a PCE of 3.0% (Voc = 0.58 V, Jsc = 7.4 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.69). Further improvements in PCE should be possible if the morphology and thickness of the BHJ layer can be optimized.53
The very small and stable functional group, methano-CH2 group, merely affects the conformation of the benzyl and the crystal packing of molecule, as revealed by the X-ray crystallographic analyses of 1,4-bisbenzylfullerene and its methano-congener (Fig. 6). The commonly used 56-π-electron fullerenes (e.g., bis-PCBM and bisindenefullerene) usually contain a mixture of structural isomers, which prevent them from packing well in the solid state. In addition, each isomer has a different electronic state, and the density of states (DOS) of the mixed isomers in the amorphous solids usually has a broader distribution, which produces trap sites at the band tail. It has been reported that bisPC61BM possesses much more trap states than that of PC61BM.81 Therefore, isomer-free bisfullerenes with high-lying LUMO should be promising candidates as highly efficient acceptors for BHJ devices.

2.4. Fulleropyrrolidines
Fulleropyrrolidines were synthesized through the classical Prato reaction for attaching functional groups (either an aldehyde or a ketone group) onto C60 using sarcosine as the amino acid component. This is an efficient methodology for attaching versatile functional groupsR1 and R2 to the fullerene core in a one-pot reaction, which has been widely used to prepare fullerene derivatives with a broad array of functionalities. Fulleropyrrolidine derivatives are generally stable under ambient conditions and are easy to prepare (Scheme 7).
 Scheme 7  General synthesis of fulleropyrrolidines and fullerene structures discussed in the text. 
A systematic study of the fulleropyrrolidine derivatives as acceptor has been reported by Itoh et al.98 When N-methoxy-ethoxyethyl-2-(2-methoxyphenyl)fulleropyrrolidine was used as acceptor with P3HT in a BHJ device, it showed an improved PCE of 3.44% compared to 2.53% for the reference device using PC61BM as the acceptor. The main improvement was from the enhanced Voc, 0.66 V, compared to that of PCBM (Voc, 0.58 V). The current–voltage characteristics of polymer solar cells derived from various substituents (H, Me, Cl, Br, F, CF3, MeO, n-hexyloxy) on the phenyl ring of fulleropyrrolidines and different aromatics instead of the phenyl ring (naphthyl, thienyl, H) are tabulated in Table 4.

Interestingly, no matter what kind of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents were used, the position of substituent on the phenyl ring showed certain influence on the PCE of devices. For instance, the methyl group at the meta-position of the phenyl ring showed a slightly higher PCE. While the electron-withdrawing groups, like chlorine, bromine, or fluorine, on the ortho-substituted compounds produced better results than the corresponding meta- or para-substituted compounds as shown in Table 4. The strong electron-withdrawing CF3 group will decrease the photovoltaic performance of devices. In the case of no aromatic substituent on the pyrrolidine ring, the device derived from using N-methoxyethoxyethylfulleropyrrolidine showed a very poor PCE (0.85%) and Jsc value (2.88 mA cm−2).
Kim et al. have recently reported the use of C60-fused N-methyl-2-3-hexylthiophen-2-yl-pyrrolidine C60-TH-Hx99 as acceptor along with a low bandgap polymer, Si-PCPDTBT, in BHJ solar cells to show a respectable PCE of 4% (Voc = 0.68 V, Jsc = 10.62 mA cm−2, FF = 0.56). The C60-TH-Hx showed a high electron mobility of 1.4–1.8 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 as measured in n-type FETs. Comparing the performance of BHJ solar cells based on PC61BM with Si-PCPDTBT showed that the one with C60-TH-Hx as acceptor yielded a larger Voc (0.68 V) than the PC61BM based devices (Voc, 0.59 V).
Another class of fulleropyrrolidine-based azoaromatic dyads can efficiently absorb visible light in the 500–600 nm range, as reported by Maggini et al., along with their photophysical characterization and performance of single molecular component photovoltaic cells.100 Their studies revealed a multiple-step energy transfer from the donor singlet excited state to the fullerene triplet excited state, which in turn decays back to the donor triplet state. The inefficient formation of a charge-separated state, both in solution and in the solid state, translated into a poor photovoltaic performance of dyads. In addition, the results from the photophysical investigation suggested that the performance of the solar cells was also limited by the low-lying donor triplet excited state that acts as photoexcitation energy sink.
Other nitrogen-containing fullerenes, iminofullerene isomers, [5,6]-open azafulleroid ([5,6] open APCBM) and [6,6]-closed aziridinofullerene ([6,6]-closed APCBM), have been paired with P3HT donor to compare their PSC performance. Owing to an enhanced photocurrent in the open APCBM device, the efficiency of the open APCBM based device (2.8%) is slightly higher than that of the closed APCBM based device (2.3%).101 Chen and Chuang et al. have reported fulleroisoquinolinones as electron acceptors. These molecules were synthesized by the palladium-catalyzed annulation of N-alkyl benzamides with C60. Fullero-isoquinolinone contains a C(Sp3)–N bond at the C60/addend junction, rather than the usual C(Sp3)–C(Sp3) bond configuration. The device derived from its blend with P3HT exhibited a moderate PCE of ∼2.3%.102
2.5. 
          Dihydronaphthyl
          fullerenes


          Dihydronaphthyl
          fullerenes as acceptors in PSCs were first reported by Fréchet et al.59 As shown in Scheme 8, the synthesis was performed by directly reacting C60 with ortho-dimethinequinine (formed in situ by reacting methyl-(3,4-dibromomethyl)-benzoate with potassium iodide). The reduction by di-isobutyl-aluminium hydride selectively converted the ester to benzyl alcohol. The sufficiently soluble form based on the alcohol of dihydronaphthyl fullerene could be transformed easily into fullerenoids via esterification. In a BHJ device with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:fullerene/Al, the dihydronaphthyl fullerene 3 gave the best PCE, 4.5%, which is slightly higher than the device made from P3HT/PCBM. Mono- and bis-o-quino-dimethane C60 (o-QDMC60) adducts in BHJ PSCs were also studied by blending with P3HT.60,83,103 The fullerene adducts provided an enhanced Voc, Jsc and FF, which resulted in a PCE of 4.1% (Voc = 0.64 V, Jsc = 9.5 mA cm−2, FF = 67) for mono-o-QDMC60 and 5.2% (Voc = 0.82 V, Jsc = 9.4 mA cm−2, FF = 66) for bis-o-QDMC60.
 Scheme 8  Synthesis of dihydronaphthyl fullerenes. 
2.6. Penta(organo) fullerenes
The addition of organocopper reagent to C60 allows the exclusive formation of penta(organo)fullerenes as shown in Scheme 9. The large cone-shaped space derived from the addition of five aromatic addends is able to embrace a second fullerene, which promoted the one-dimensional head-to-tail assemblies of pentafullerenes, like stacked up shuttle cocks.104 And the rational control of cone-shaped space of these fullerenes allows forming designable fullerene self-assemblies.104–107 Rubin et al. studied two pentafullerenes, penta 1 and 2, whose molecular shapes can either promote or hinder the formation of 1-D stacks. The PCE of solar cells based on the blends of the stacking penta 1 (up to ca. 1.5%) with P3HT is enhanced compared to the nonstacking penta 2. Nakamura et al. reported the photovoltaic properties of BHJ devices with P3HT and pentaaryl[60]fullerene acceptors, C60(C6H4Ph)5Me, C60(C6H4OPh)5Me, C60(C6H4nBu)5Me, Fe[C60(C6H4nBu)5]Cp, and Ru[C60(C6H4nBu)5]Cp. Although the homogeneous distribution of donor and acceptor in BHJ and high Voc (up to 0.76 V) could be obtained, devices based on these blends only gave poor performance (up to 1.08%), owing to the low photocurrent value. The high-lying LUMO of pentafullerene (∼0.4 eV higher than that of PCBM) may cause insufficient charge separation in BHJ.61

2.7. Open caged fullerenes
Classic open-caged fullerenes have also been explored to introduce suitable solubilizing functionalities, tune the energy levels, and alter the π-conjugation of fullerenes. Open caged fullerenes as n-type materials for BHJ solar cells have been demonstrated by Murata et al.62 and Chen et al. (Table 5 and Scheme 10).63 The best performance was obtained from the blend of open cage fullerene 3 with P3HT that showed a PCE of 3.11% (Voc = 0.74 V, Jsc = 6.57 mA cm−2, FF = 0.64). While the reference solar cell with PCBM/P3HT as the BHJ layer exhibited a PCE of 3.12% (Voc = 0.60 V, Jsc = 7.76 mA cm−2, FF = 0.67) (Table 5, Entry 3). This approach provides an effective way to control the LUMO level of the C60 π-system to improve Voc (Table 5, Entries 1–3) and it also can allow the incorporation of dyes to enhance light-absorbing properties.

3. Functional fullerenes for electron selective layer (ESL)
In addition to the optimization of acceptor in the BHJ layer, effective control of the organic–metal interface is also very critical for achieving high-performance PSCs.33,108–110 Although a low work function (Φ) metal such as Ca (2.9 eV) has been proved to be able to form Ohmic contact as cathode, its vulnerability to environmental conditions undermines its use for practical applications.111 A more stable metal like Al has been used to replace Ca as cathode, but its relatively high Φ (4.28 eV) often causes energy level mismatch between the polymer:fullerene blend and itself for getting efficient electron collection. This resulted in lower Voc and device performance. To alleviate this problem, proper interfacial engineering by inserting a thin electron-transporting layer between cathode and the active layer has been explored. Although numerous inorganic and organic interfacial materials have been studied, such as LiF,112Cs2CO3,113,114 metal oxides (TiOx, ZnOx),115–117 organic materials PEO,118,119conjugated polymer surfactants,28,120 n-typed conjugated polymers,121 and fullerene-based interfacial materials possess inherent merits as good ESL for PSCs, because of their tunable energy levels, good electron transport, and chemical compatibility to the BHJ layer. Compared to their inorganic counterparts, the use of pure n-type organic semiconducting materials as ESLs is much less explored despite their promise as interfacial materials for OPVs.
3.1. 
          Fullerene-based self-assembled monolayers
Modification of the inorganic/organic interface with functional SAMs has been proven as an effective method to lower the contact resistance of PSCs.122 In general, the charge recombination loss at the organic/inorganic interface significantly limits the performance of inverted-structure devices because of the unfavourable energetic and chemical interface. Jen et al. have studied C60-SAMs containing different anchoring groups (catechol, carboxylic acid, and phosphonic acid), linkage location, and functionalization to improve the contact properties between the BHJ and ZnO or TiOx in inverted PSCs.123–125 The SAMs reduce the series resistance and improve the shunt resistance of the cells, leading to increased fill factor and photocurrent density. Different aspects of device improvement can be affected depending on the nature of the SAMs (Scheme 11).
 Scheme 11  Structure of fullerene SAMs and schematic drawing of different electronic processes at the organic/inorganic interface. Such a functional monolayer can serve multiple purposes, including enhancing interfacial exciton-dissociation efficiency, enabling passivation of inorganic-surface trap states, and optimizing upper organic-layer morphology. hν: Photon energy; e−, h+: electrons, holes.

Modification of ZnO with a C60-SAM showed the biggest enhancement, which led to a 35% improvement (η = 3.78%) over the unmodified inverted devices (η = 2.80%). However, because of the strong acidic nature of the phosphonic acid anchoring group, the immersion of the ZnO substrate into a C60-phosphonic acid SAM-containing solution for an extended period of time will degrade the ZnO surface, while other metal oxides, ITO126 and AlOx,127 are stable toward phosphonic acid anchoring. This, in turn, rendered devices without any photovoltaic activity, whereas the weaker acids like carboxylic acid and catechol-based C60-SAMs can be assembled densely onto ZnO, leading to devices with the average efficiencies of 4.4 and 4.2%, respectively. This strategy has also been applied to the BHJ layer composed of new low bandgap polymers, which resulted in similar improvement in device efficiency.128
3.2. Cross-linkable fullerenes
Cross-linking is a commonly used method in organic electronics to make robust materials for the fabrication of solvent-resistant multi-layered thin films. Incorporating reactive groups onto solution processable molecules or polymers and then cross-linking them with thermal, light, or chemical treatments will produce robust films.129,130 Cross-linkable functional fullerenes have been demonstrated by Cheng and Hsu et al. as a good candidate for ESL in inverted PSCs. As shown in Scheme 12, several modified PCBM molecules bearing either styryl groups (PCBS and PCBSD) or oxetane groups (PCBO and PCBOD) have been studied as effective ESL in inverted solar cells.
 Scheme 12  Chemical structures of cross-linkable fullerene. 
The formation of a cross-linked PCBSD (C-PCBSD) interlayer was achieved through thermal annealing at 150 °C, which showed good solvent resistance and wetting properties to subsequent coating of a BHJ layer. An inverted solar cell device based on the device configuration of ITO/ZnO/C-PCBSD/PCBM:P3HT/PEDOT:PSS/Ag has been shown to have an enhanced PCE of 4.4% compared to 3.5% of the reference device without the fullerene interlayer.92 Furthermore, if the higher-lying LUMO of IC60BA is used instead of PCBM as acceptor in the BHJ layer, an impressive PCE of 6.22% (Voc = 0.84 V, Jsc = 12.4 mA cm−2, FF = 60) could be achieved from device with the configuration of ITO/ZnO/C-PCBSD/ICBA:P3HT/PEDOT:PSS/Ag. The superior air stability of the inverted solar cell showed that it could retain 87% of its original PCE after being exposed to ambient conditions for 21 days.131
Organic semiconductors have relatively low conductivities as interfacial materials, which may result in poor electrical contact to electrodes. Regarding this, Jen et al. recently have reported the n-doping of cross-linked PCBS films with a solution processed n-dopant, decamethylcobaltocene (DMC). The electrical conductivity of the doped PCBS film was found to increase with the dopant concentration, which improved over 6 orders of magnitude from 1.7 × 10−7 S m−1 to 6.0 × 10−1 S m−1 when doped with 10% of DMC. The inverted device showed improved J–V characteristics with PCE two times higher than the undoped device.132
The oxetane group can be used to anchor onto the TiOx surface via the cationic ring-opening reaction under thermal and UV treatment. The oxane incorporated fullerenes, PCBO and PCBOD, were found to be able to form a self-assembled layer and be cross-linked on top of TiOx to function as ESL. These thin layers efficiently lowered the contact resistance and improved charge collection. An inverted device based on the configuration of ITO/TiOx/SA-PCBO/P3HT:PCBM (1:1, w/w)/MoO3/Ag showed a PCE of 4.1%, which is higher than the reference device (PCE = 3.6%) without the ESL. The device based on the configuration of ITO/TiOx/C-PCBOD/P3HT:PCBM(1:1 wt%)/MoO3/Ag with this cross-linked PCBOD (C-PCBOD) as interlayer showed the highest PCE of 4.5%, which represents a 26% enhancement over the reference device.133
Cheng and Hsu et al. have recently reported the results for optimizing and stabilizing the morphology of the BHJ layer by cross-linking PCBS or PCBSD in the BHJ layer to form a ternary blend system. After the in situ cross-linking, the device showed high stability, with an average PCE of 3.7% during isothermal heating at 150 °C for 25 h.134 More interestingly, they have reported that arrays of fullerene nanorods could be developed by using an AAO template-assisted cross-linking of PCBSD (Fig. 7). By forming vertically aligned fullerene nanorods, a higher PCE of 7.3% could be obtained from the P3HT:ICBA BHJ based inverted PSC (Voc = 0.84 V, Jsc = 12.07 mA cm−2, and FF = 72.3%) compared to 6.2% PCE (Voc = 0.84 V, Jsc = 11.17 mA cm−2, FF = 66.0%) from the device without the C-PCBSD nanorods. The nanostructured device also exhibited superior air stability, which can maintain 90% of its initial PCE value after being exposed to ambient conditions for 450 h.93

3.3. Self-assembled fullerenes
Multi-layered structures are essential for PSCs because they can strongly affect charge-transporting properties across the organic/organic135 or organic/metal interfaces and the optical properties of the films.33,135 By controlling the surface energy of materials, one can engineer the phase segregation in a BHJ film, for instance, fluorinated compounds prefer to migrate to the air/liquid interface during coating, which is driven by the total energy minimization of the system.136,137 Hashimoto et al. have reported a novel and simple approach to form layered structures in organic thin films by utilizing a modified PCBM with a fluorocarbon chain (F-PCBM).138 By mixing a small amount of F-PCBM in the solution for spin coating, the F-PCBM spontaneously migrated onto the surface of the organic layer during spin coating, and formed a very thin layer of F-PCBM in a single step (Fig. 8), which served as a good ESL. As a result, the energy barrier for electron injection and collection could be reduced, yielding a better photovoltaic performance based on the P3HT:PCBM BHJ devices.

PEG was also able to form surface segregation on top of the BHJ layer when it was mixed in P3HT:PCBM containing solution for spin coating. A very thin layer of PEG was found to be a good interfacial material.118,119 When combining with good electron transporting properties of fullerene, a PEG modified PCBM could be developed as an electron-selective layer for devices with the P3HT:PCBM active layer. When 5 wt% of PEG-C60 was used, the performance of PSC was largely enhanced (PCE = 4.41, Voc = 0.66 V, Jsc = 10.27 mA cm−2, FF = 0.65, Rs = 5.51 Ω cm−2) compared to the device without PEG-C60 (PCE = 3.60, Voc = 0.61 V, Jsc = 10.17 mA cm−1, FF = 0.58, Rs = 13.25 Ω cm2) (Scheme 13).139,140
 Scheme 13  Chemical structures of fullerenes that can be self-assembled. 
3.4. Orthogonal-solvent processed fullerene ESL
Alternatively, by spin-coating a fullerene material on top of the active layer with an orthogonal solvent, it allows the formation of a controllable ESL on top of BHJ. Jen et al. have recently developed two methanol-soluble fullerene surfactants which incorporate a cationic nitrogen and polar PEO groups as an interfacial layer for cathodes in PSCs. ETL-1 and ETL-2 could be spin-coated directly from their methanol solutions on top of the active layer to form a smooth ESL. These surfactants facilitated the tuning of cathode work function and extraction of electrons to enhance photocurrent generation (Fig. 9).141
 Fig. 9  The performance of polymer solar cells based on PIDTBT:PC71BM improved significantly (as high as 83%) when this kind of interfacial layer was applied to the devices. 
Devices based on different BHJs were tested and in all cases devices with either ETL-1 or ETL-2 showed much improved Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE. Since ETL-2 possessed better film-forming properties, the effect of different metal cathodes (Al, Ag, and Cu) on the OPV efficiency and stability was further investigated based on the PIDT-phanQ:PC71BM BHJ system (Table 6).142 The best PCE (6.2%) was found when a reflective Ag cathode was used as cathode. XPS studies suggested that the ETL 2 film efficiently reduced the effective work function for all three metals, which facilitated an Ohmic contact at the BHJ/cathode interface to achieve a maximized Voc independent of the choice of metal. Devices based on Cu and Ag cathodes showed much better ambient stability than the one that used Al. This finding is very important for further developing efficient, stable, and roll-to-roll processable polymer solar cells. With ETL-2, the Cu electrode based devices remained very stable, which retained nearly 90% of its original PCE after being exposed over 100 h in air. Details of the synthesis of ETL-1 and -2 and their photovoltaic application will be reported elsewhere.

4. Functional fullerene as morphology stabilizer in the BHJ layer
Controlling phase separation to obtain interpenetrating networks of D/A domains in optimal size strongly affects the charge generation and charge transport in the BHJ layer, as well as device performance.26 On the other hand, the maintenance of an optimal BHJ morphology is also important for enhancing the device lifetime. It is well-known that the spherical PCBM tends to diffuse out of the polymer matrix and aggregate into larger clusters or single crystals under continuous heating, thus deteriorating the photovoltaic performance (Fig. 10).

In this regard, the thiophene–fullerene hybrid materials (Scheme 14) were used to stabilize the P3HT:PCBM based BHJ layer, which is preferably located at the D/A interfaces to reduce the interfacial energy between immiscible D/A components, and to stabilize the phase morphology. The first example introduced by Fréchet et al. was that an amphiphilic di-block copolymer 1 could be used as an additive, also as a compatibilizer, to stabilize the device structure against destructive thermal phase segregation (Fig. 10).143 Another example was given using a well-defined rod–coil block copolymer (P3HT-b-P(SxAy)-C60).144
 Scheme 14  Structure of thiophene-incorporated fullerene used as morphology stabilizer in BHJ. 
A solid-state thermal reaction between the azide groups attached to P3HT and PCBM rendered the films largely insoluble and a stabilized morphology.145 Alternatively, a poly(3-hexylthiophene) end capped with fullerene (P3HT-C60)146 and fullerene end-capped polyethylene glycol140 also exhibited effective control of BHJ morphology.
Owing to the self-assembling behaviour of thiophene–fullerene hybrid materials, single-component photovoltaic devices based on P3HT diblock copolymers with fullerene-attached side chains have been studied and have shown microphase-separated nanopatterns and high thermal stability.147 In addition to block-copolymers, small thiophene-C60 derivatives,148,149 such as 4T-C60, have been prepared by Loo et al. It showed a surface energy of 18.40 mN m−1 (4T-C60), which is in between that of P3HT (16.8 mN m−1) and PCBM (30.1 mN m−1). The addition of 4T-C60 reduces the interfacial energy between P3HT and PCBM, as evidenced by the constancy of the efficiency with thermal annealing at 170 for 3 h.64 It effectively stabilized the blends (5 wt% to P3HT and PCBM) for PSC application.
5. Conclusions
The current challenges for OPV research are to find an effective way to improve cell and module efficiencies so that they can be produced in low-cost, lightweight and flexible forms with suitable lifetime for practical applications. To achieve these goals, tremendous efforts are needed in improving the design and processing of new active materials. Compared with the fast growth of p-type conjugated polymers, the development of n-type fullerene materials is lagging behind. Only until few years ago, a number of molecularly engineered molecules started to appear and showed encouraging photovoltaic performance when blended with conjugated polymer donors.
Owing to their different functions in OPVs, we have summarized these developments into three categories of functional fullerenes: (1) acceptors, (2) ESLs, and (3) morphology stabilizer. All these different classes of materials showed great progress but still need to be further optimized. For instance, in addition to the proper energy level and high mobility, the fullerene acceptor in the BHJ layer should possess proper surface energy, light absorption, and solubility, as well as good thermal stability. For efficient charge extraction from the BHJ layer to electrodes, a thin fullerene ESL on top of BHJ should possess good processability, film forming properties, and excellent electron characteristics. Furthermore, the ability to form proper interactions with metal cathode to shift the work function is also critical. To extend the lifetime of devices, fullerene materials should remain stable in both their BHJ layers, and at the interfaces with electrodes. Although there still are many challenges ahead before practical polymer solar cells will arrive in the market place, the research in functional fullerenes deserves to have more attention in order to expedite this development process.
