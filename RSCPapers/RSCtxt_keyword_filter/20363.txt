    , Accepted 26th February 2021First published on 1st March 2021AbstractMethoxy-free donors are an emerging class of alternative methoxy triphenylamine materials toward stable organic hole-transporting materials (HTMs). However, low cost, stable and efficient methoxy-free donors are scarce. Moreover, the lack of a molecular design strategy limits the further development of methoxy-free donor-based HTMs. This study reports a newly developed low cost hybrid methoxy-free donor (viz., indeno[2,1-b]carbazole) as well as a triple π-bridge strategy to enhance the performance of methoxy-free donor-based HTMs. Based on this strategy, two new indeno[2,1-b]carbazole HTMs, termed M136 and M138, were tailor-made and tested in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Upon incorporating the triple π-bridges (i.e. thiophene-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole-thiophene and thiophene-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene-thiophene), the resulting indeno[2,1-b]carbazole HTMs (M136 and M138) exhibit a significantly increased hole mobility, improved charge extraction and minimized trap-assisted recombination as compared to M135 and M137 with unitary and binary bridges, respectively. Consequently, the optimized devices based on M138 achieved an efficiency of 21.37%, which is among the top efficiencies for PSCs based on methoxy-free donor HTMs. The findings demonstrate that indeno[2,1-b]carbazole is an excellent methoxy-free donor. In addition, this work underscores the effectiveness of π-bridge engineering to improve the performance of methoxy-free donor-based HTMs.
1 Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted tremendous attention in the field of photovoltaics (PV) due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties.1–12 n-i-p PSCs consist of an electron-transfer layer (ETL), a perovskite material and a uniform layer of thin hole-transporting materials (HTMs), and these layers jointly determine the solar cell performances. Commercial spiro-OMeTAD is a prevalently used HTM due to its high performance and reproducibility. Unfortunately, this HTM suffers from expensive purification processes and low hole mobilities, which has motivated intensive research efforts in finding new efficient HTMs such as small organic HTMs,13–57 polymers,58–61 and metal–organic compounds.62–65 The small organic HTMs have gained great attention in the rational molecular design of HTMs due to their facile synthesis and excellent hole transporting capability.
Combining peripheral arylamine donors with central scaffolds has been identified as the most common way to construct small organic HTMs.15,26 Numerous central scaffolds such as spiro-compounds, arylamines, thiophene-containing segments and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have been explored to modulate the carrier mobility, energy level and morphology of HTMs. In contrast, the exploration of new peripheral arylamine donors is currently rather limited. So far, the most efficient HTMs still rely on methoxy-substituted triphenylamine (OMe-TPA) and OMe-substituted diphenylamine (OMe-DPA).15,26 However, despite their high performance, OMe-TPA and OMe-DPA are not perfect. For example, methoxy usually leads to a higher HOMO level and lower glass transition temperature (Tg) of HTMs, which may result in a decreased open-circuit voltage and device stability.33 To overcome the bottlenecks from the methoxy group, it is necessary to develop new donors as alternatives to OMe-TPA and OMe-DPA.
Strategies including the partial substitution of the methoxy group,28,66–68 fluorination of the donor33 and removing the methoxy group24,54,69,70 were employed for the design of better donors (Scheme 1). Despite the initial reports, obtaining a high efficiency methoxy-free donor by getting rid of the methoxy group remains a challenge. Originally, Nishimura et al. introduced oxygen-bridged triarylamines as quasi-planar scaffolds for an azulene based HTM, which achieves a power conversion efficiency of 16.5%.69 Then, Li and co-workers70 developed dopant-free HTMs based on 9-phenyl-9H-carbazole. After that, acenaphthylene was used successfully as the end-capping unit, and the ACE-QA-ACE HTM exhibits high performance showing a champion efficiency of 18.2%.24 Pola and co-workers reported two dopant-free HTMs based on the benzothiophene donor.31 These studies demonstrated that the introduction of donors with a planar backbone could reinforce intermolecular interactions and π−π stacking, which is beneficial for improving charge transport abilities even though HTMs lack methoxy groups. Previously, we have reported indeno[1,2-b]carbazole54 based HTMs for PSCs, and found that the methoxy-free hybrid donor contributed to both the efficiency and the stability of devices simultaneously. Nevertheless, to date, the development of a methoxy-free donor for HTMs is still in its infancy, and the design strategy for methoxy-free donor based HTMs needs to be further established.
 Scheme 1  Strategies for the design of new donors. 
In this work, a new methoxy-free hybrid donor, i.e. indeno[2,1-b]carbazole group (Fig. 1), is reported. This building block is commercially available (CAS number 1257220-47-5) and the price is not high (the commercial price is about 25 $ g−1, Energy Chemical, China). In addition, the cost for lab synthesis of an indeno[2,1-b]carbazole-based HTM M138 is estimated to be about 51 $ g−1 (please find details in the ESI†), which is much lower than that of spiro-OMeTAD71 (≈92 $ g−1). Compared to indeno[1,2-b]carbazole we reported recently, indeno[2,1-b]carbazole is cheaper. This is importance for substantial reduction in fabrication costs. Indeed, methoxy-free hybrid donors contribute to the stability of HTMs. Methoxy removal, however, is accompanied by a decreased interaction between the HTM and perovskite absorber, which plays a crucial role in reducing interfacial recombination losses and charge extraction. Nonetheless, the interaction between the HTM and perovskite absorber can be tuned by adjusting the π-bridge. Thus, seeking π-bridges which have rich interaction sites with metal cations of the perovskite absorber is of great importance to improve the performance of methoxy-free donor-derived HTMs.
 Fig. 1  Chemical structures of indeno [2,1-b]carbazole and M135–138. 
Herein, two indeno[2,1-b]carbazole-HTMs M136 and M138 have been designed and synthesized by incorporating a triple π-bridge based on thiophene, dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) or 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) (Fig. 1). It is interesting to find that both HTMs show an impressive efficiency of over 20% under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G solar illumination. Unexpectedly, the replacement of thiophene-DTP-thiophene by a thiophene-EDOT-thiophene bridge gave amazing results. Upon systematic optimization of the HTM layer, meso n-i-p structured PSCs based on doped M138 achieve a champion PCE of 21.37%, which is the best result for PSCs employing methoxy-free donor-HTMs reported so far. To deeply understand the relationship between the methoxy-free hybrid donor and the triple π-bridge, we have also systematically investigated the influencing factors of the donor/bridge, on the opto-electrical, hole mobility, film morphology and thermal stability of HTMs as well as the performance of devices. These results further signify that decorating the methoxy-free donor with a triple bridge is a universal and effective strategy for highly efficient methoxy-free donor-derived HTMs.
2 Results and discussion
2.1 Design and synthesis
The rationale for developing the methoxy-free hybrid donor is as follows: (1) the donor can be judiciously designed via functionalization of any chemical moiety. Thus, it is feasible to tune the properties of donors. (2) The two-dimensional geometry of the molecule would be advantageous for effective delocalization and intermolecular stacking.25 (3) The extended conjugation backbone of the hybrid donor could significantly improve the glass transition temperature (Tg) and decomposition temperatures (Td), and eventually the stability of the resulting PSCs. In this report, bulk indeno[2,1-b]carbazole combined with dimethylfluorene and carbazole units is expected to reinforce intermolecular interactions, increase the thermal stability of HTMs and improve the film quality. On the other hand, thiophene-DTP-thiophene7 and thiophene-EDOT-thiophene42,72 bridges were introduced so as to improve the performance of methoxy-free donor-derived HTMs. Both bridges have rich interaction sites (oxygen and sulfur atoms) with metal cations of perovskite. To reveal the superior performance of the triple bridge compared to the unitary and binary bridges, M135 (with the DTP bridge) and M137 (with the bithiophene bridge) were introduced as the reference HTMs. The detailed synthetic routes and characterization results (1H NMR and 13C NMR) of M135–138 are depicted in the ESI.†
2.2 Optoelectronic properties and calculations
The photophysical properties of M135–138 were examined by UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy in dichloromethane solution, and the normalized UV−vis absorption spectra of HTMs are shown in Fig. 2a–d. The maximum absorption peaks (λabs) combined with differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) data allowed the estimation of the highest-occupied and lowest–occupied molecular orbital energy levels (HOMO and LUMO respectively), as summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2a and c, the λabs of the M135 solution (401 nm) is very close to that of the M137 solution (396 nm), indicating that the influences of DTP and bithiophene on the effect of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the donor and bridge are very similar. However, a significant red shift (around 40 nm) was observed for λabs assigned to M136 (λabs = 441 nm) compared to M135 and M137, highlighting the stronger ICT transition arising from the triple π-bridge. This effect can also be found for thiophene-EDOT-thiophene-containing M138 (λabs = 444 nm). Apparently, the extended π-system is advantageous for enhancing the conjugation effect, which is beneficial for achieving a higher hole mobility.17,30,50,73

Furthermore, both thiophene-DTP-thiophene/thiophene-EDOT-thiophene and indeno[2,1-b]carbazole have a planar π-conjugated surface as compared to spiro compounds. The flat configuration of the molecule (Fig. S1†) can result in better π–π stacking as manifested by the UV−vis absorption spectra of solid-state films. As presented in Fig. 2a–d, the absorption spectra of films based on all these HTMs are broadened or shifted due to aggregation as compared to their solution data. These results indicate that these indeno[2,1-b]carbazole HTMs have a stronger tendency to aggregate. For examples, the thin film absorbance data of M136 are red-shifted by 13 nm in the visible area compared to the solution data. In the case of the M138-based film, there is a blue-shift (7 nm) as well as a much broadened band, which can be ascribed to the noncovalent S⋯O interaction in thiophene-EDOT-thiophene.42
To reveal the correlation between the ICT effect and the π-bridge, the isosurfaces of the electron density of the HOMO and LUMO for M135–138 were calculated by density functional theory (DFT). As depicted in Fig. 2e, the HOMO for all HTMs is populated over the indeno[2,1-b]carbazole donor and π-bridge as expected, whereas the LUMO of these HTMs has the electron density localized mainly on the π-bridge. Electron movement occurs from the donor unit to the core during the HOMO–LUMO excitation. However, the LUMO orbit for these HTMs is different. It can be found that there is a lack of electron distribution on the terminal of indeno[2,1-b]carbazole of M136. In contrast, M135 still has electron distribution on the terminal part of indeno[2,1-b]carbazole. This comparison suggests that the introduction of two thiophene units is beneficial for electron transfer. This suggestion is supported by the LUMO of M137, which shows a small electron distribution on the terminal of the donor. Also, the thiophene-EDOT-thiophene bridge caused an efficient ICT transition in M138.
The electrochemical properties of M135–137 sensitized electrodes were further investigated by DPV measurements in CH2Cl2 solution (Fig. 3a). The energy–level diagrams of the related materials used in this study are illustrated in Fig. 3b. The results show that the HOMO energy levels of M135, M136, M137 and M138 are −5.03 eV, −4.99 eV, −5.25 eV and −5.11 eV, respectively. These HTMs could effectively extract the charge from the perovskite at the interface since their HOMO levels are higher than those of mixed-ion perovskite materials. The HOMO of M135 (−5.03 eV) is much higher than that of M137 (−5.25 eV), suggesting that the fused DTP unit has a higher charge density than 2,2′-bithiophene. As expected, M136 shows the highest HOMO (−4.99 eV) among these HTMs due to the combination of bithiophene and DTP. In contrast, M138 (−5.11 eV) with thiophene-EDOT-thiophene shows a deeper HOMO than M136, indicating that M138 could offer a higher open-circuit voltage (VOC) in PSC devices. Furthermore, the HOMO level of M135 (−5.03 V) is found to be high than that of M129 (ref. 54) (which features the indeno[1,2-b]carbazole donor, −5.15 V), and this result reveals a stronger donating capability of indeno[2,1-b]carbazole than that of indeno[1,2-b]carbazole.

2.3 Hole mobility and film morphology
The hole transporting properties of the HTMs are investigated by the space charge-limited-current (SCLC) method (Fig. 4a), where a hole only device with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/HTMs/Ag was used. The results revealed that the central bridge significantly affected the hole transporting properties of the HTMs. The measured hole mobility value of M135 with a DTP core is 1.93 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Meanwhile, M137 featuring the binary bridge bithiophene shows the lowest hole mobility (8.85 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) among these HTMs. Noted that, the hole mobility of M136 increased by around 8.2-fold from 1.93 × 10−4 to 1.58 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 as the DTP core was replaced by the thiophene-DTP-thiophene triple bridge. In addition, the mobility of M138 (1.85 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) was further improved as DTP was replaced by EDOT. Clearly, incorporating the triple bridge into indeno[2,1-b]carbazole based HTMs is beneficial to efficient hole extraction and transport due to extended charge delocalization and enhanced intermolecular aggregation. The triple π-bridges based on thiophene, DTP and EDOT offer potential advantages in charge transportation because these units can induce additional intermolecular S–S and S–π interactions, thus reducing the intermolecular distance and increasing the hole hopping channels.18 Note that, the mobility values of M136 and M138 exceed that of spiro-OMeTAD (hole mobility = 1.26 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1).74 This can be attributed to the flat configuration of the molecule and the coplanar π-extended indeno [2,1-b]carbazole as well as the triple π-bridges (Fig. S1†) which are beneficial to improve the intermolecular charge transport via enhanced π–π stacking.18 Despite that, there is room left for further enhancement by chain engineering or introducing a strong acceptor to improve the intrinsic hole mobilities of indeno[2,1-b]carbazole-based HTMs. We also measured the conductivities of these HTMs (Fig. S2†). It turns out that M136 (5.09 × 10−6 S cm−1) and M138 (6.52 × 10−6 S cm−1) with the triple π-bridge are superior to M135 (4.69 × 10−6 S cm−1) and M137 (2.19 × 10−6 S cm−1) regarding the conductivity. The trend is consistent with the results of the hole mobility test.

The film morphologies of HTMs with dopants were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM), and the topographic AFM images of M135, M136, M137 and M138 capping on the perovskite layers are presented in Fig. 4b–e. Compared with the irregular and coarse perovskite polycrystalline film, the spin-coated HTM films based on M135–138 exhibit full coverage and low surface fluctuation. The root-mean-square roughness (RMS) is significantly decreased when the perovskite layer (RMS = 20.4 nm) is covered by M135 (RMS = 7.01 nm), M136 (RMS = 7.30 nm), M137 (RMS = 8.31 nm) and M138 (RMS = 7.44 nm). The AFM inspection revealed that M135, M136 and M138 films exhibit a uniform and smooth surface, which enhances the interfacial contact between the perovskite and HTM and/or HTM and anode electrode. The RMS values of these samples are similar although they have different π-bridges, and these results pointed to the indeno[2,1-b]carbazole donor governing the quality of films. In contrast, M137 shows a cratered surface, which could be attributed to its bad solubility in chlorobenzene (the maximum concentration in chlorobenzene is 20 mM). Furthermore, we also record the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the perovskite coated with thin HTMs. It can be seen from Fig. S3† that the films of M135, M136 and M138 are very smooth without small crystalline grains. Similar to the result of AFM, M137 exhibits a rough morphology, and small pinholes are discernible throughout the film, which results in a poor physical contact with a perovskite layer.
2.4 Thermal properties
To test the thermal stability of M135–138, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were carried out (Fig. 5). DSC curves reveal that all these new HTMs are amorphous materials since there is no obvious melting point observed from room temperature to 300 °C. M135, M137 and M138 exhibit a high glass transition temperature of 158, 155 and 154 °C, respectively. M136 shows a slightly lower Tg of 140 °C (Fig. 5b), and still the value is higher than that of spiro-MeOTAD (Tg = 125 °C).73 The high Tg and decomposition temperature of the HTMs highlight their morphological stability of the amorphous film and potential thermal stability in PSCs. Noted that the comparison of Tg of M137 with that of M102 (ref. 42) (Tg = 76 °C, Fig. 5e) shows that donor tuning from OMe-TPA to indeno[2,1-b]carbazole leads to a significant increase of Tg by 76 °C. These results suggest that indeno[2,1-b]carbazole could significantly contribute to the thermal stability of the HTMs. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) for M135–138 was performed under a nitrogen atmosphere. The Td corresponding to a 10% weight loss of M135, M136, M137 and M138 is 441 °C, 441 °C, 470 °C and 400 °C, respectively, suggesting the good thermal stability of indeno[2,1-b]carbazole-based HTMs.

2.5 Photovoltaic properties of the HTMs
To evaluate the photovoltaic properties of these HTMs in PSC devices, we fabricated PSC devices with a device architecture of FTO/c-TiO2/meso-TiO2/CsFAMA/HTMs/Au (Fig. 6a). CsFAMA is an ion-mixed perovskite active layer (FAPbI3)0.875(MAPbBr3)0.075(CsPbI3)0.05(PbI2)0.03, which was reported by Wang and co-workers.27 Current–voltage characteristics were measured under 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5 G illumination) using a Newport solar simulator (Keithley 2400). The cells were masked with a black metal mask limiting the active area to 0.09 cm2 and reducing the influence of the scattered light (Figure S4†). The details of photovoltaic performance characterization can be found in the ESI.† Surprisingly, an impressively high photocurrent can be achieved by this kind of perovskite active layer as meso-TiO2 was employed as the electron transfer layer. The current–voltage (J–V) curves obtained from the best-performing solar cells are displayed in Fig. 6b, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The corresponding incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra are displayed in Fig. S5.† Their integrated photocurrent densities agree with the JSC trend observed in J–V scanning. Compared with the JSC values from J–V measurements, the integrated currents from IPCE are slightly lower, and this result can be attributed to the weaker intensity of individual wavelengths.35,37 All the devices that were made by employing different HTMs exhibited little hysteresis (Fig. S6†). The M135 and M137-doped devices exhibited a PCE of merely 19.86% and 16.09%, respectively. Compared to M129 (PCE = 20.41%, Table S1†) with the indeno[1,2-b]carbazole donor, M135 exhibits a slightly lower efficiency. Despite that, it is difficult to conclude that indeno[1,2-b]carbazole is absolutely better than indeno[2,1-b]carbazole since the performance of the donor highly depends on the π-bridge of the HTM as well. For example, M136-doped devices show an improvement in PCE (20.56%) compared to the M135-doped devices (19.86%), which can be attributed to the higher mobility of the triple thiophene-DTP-thiophene bridge. The superiority of the triple π-bridge was further demonstrated by M138. As presented in the cross-sectional SEM image of one device based on M138 (Fig. S7†), a dense layer of M138 is uniformly deposited between the perovskite absorber and gold electrode, indicating a good interfacial contact. Encouragingly, the M138-based PSCs deliver a significantly enhanced PCE of 21.37% with a VOC of 1.13 V, JSC of 24.89 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.76. The slightly higher VOC of M138-based devices as compared to those of M136 should be attributed to the much deeper HOMO energy level (−5.11 V vs. −4.99 V), and the higher charge-carrier mobility of M138 is responsible for its higher JSC and FF.17,75 To highlight the efficiency achieved by M138, control devices with widely used doped spiro-OMeTAD were also fabricated, showing an efficiency of 20.67% with a JSC of 24.73 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.1 V and an FF of 0.76 (Fig. S8†).

The histograms of PCEs and the statistical average of parameters are displayed in Fig. 6c (at least 36 individual devices were studied), justifying the discrepancy between the different HTMs reported in this work. The statistics of a total of 36 PSCs prepared using M135, M136, M137 and M138 exhibits an average PCE of 18.68%, 19.61%, 15.44% and 20.12%, respectively. It can be found that M136 and M138 with the trip π-bridge outperform M135 and M137 regarding PCEs. Noted that, the efficiency histogram shows that > 70% of the devices (≈25 devices) based on M138 have a PCE higher than 20%. The stabilized power output of the champion devices was obtained under constant one sun illumination (Fig. 6d). A stabilized PCE of 19.76% and 20.50% after a 200 s duration was observed for the M136 and M138-based devices, respectively, indicating a high reliability of our J–V curves. In addition, it was observed that the M135 and M137 based devices presented a gradually decreasing PCE during the test and lost ∼3.7% and 8% of the initial value after 200 s illumination, respectively. In contrast, the M136 and M138-based devices show much better photo-stability with a PCE loss of only 2% under the same conditions, suggesting that the perovskite/HTM interface for M136 and M138-based devices is more robust and stable.
2.6 Hole extraction at the perovskite/HTM interface
To further investigate the hole extraction capability of the HTMs, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurements were carried out. The steady-state PL spectra of the perovskite layers without and with capped HTMs are shown in Fig. 7a. After the introduction of the HTMs, a severe PL quenching was observed due to hole injection from the photoexcited perovskite into M135–138. As presented in Fig. 7a, the PL intensity was reduced to 11.7%, 7.5%, 25.7% and 7.1% of that of the pristine perovskite films with M135, M136, M137 and M138, respectively. Clearly, M136 and M138 bearing the triple bridge could quench the PL of perovskite more efficiently in comparison with M135 and M137. To understand the difference in the PL intensity further and to evaluate the charge extraction kinetics at the perovskite/HTM interface, we recorded the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay, which was modeled in terms of a bi-exponential equation. The fast lifetime (τ1), the long lifetime (τ2) and the average lifetime (τt) are summarized in Table S2.† The τ1 is shortened to 1.5 ns for M136-based device compared to that of M135 (133.8 ns) and M137 (213.5 ns). The reduced τ1 suggests faster charge transfer at the interface of perovskite and HTM.38 Noted that, the τ1 for the M138-based device is only 0.58 ns. Furthermore, the τt sharply decreased from 101.6 ns for the M135-based device to 29.1 ns and 25.6 ns when M136 and M138 were used as the HTM, respectively. On the other hand, the τ2 for the devices based on M136 (32.5 ns) and M138 is much longer than those of M135 (0.77 ns) and M137 (3.7 ns). These results clearly show that the combination of the indeno[2,1-b]carbazole donor with the triple bridge can increase the hole transport/extraction, while minimizing trap-assisted recombination at the perovskite/HTM interface.

2.7 Long-term stability of devices
Long-term stability is crucial for the widespread applications of PSCs. We investigated the device stability of M135-, M136-, M137-and 138-based PSCs (Fig. 8). The stability of these devices was evaluated after storing them inside a dark box, which has a humidity of about 40–45% and temperature of 25 °C. The stability test shows that the M136-and M138-based devices can retain 90% and 89% of their initial PCE after 480 h, respectively. Under the same working conditions, the devices based on M135 and M137 kept around 86% and 79% of the initial efficiency, respectively. The good stability of doped M136-based PSCs can be partially attributed to the enlarged water contact angle. Contact angle measurements (Fig. S9†) show an enlarged water contact angle of 97.4° at perovskite/M136 compared to 92.5° and 73.9° at perovskite/M135 and perovskite/M137, respectively. Meanwhile, the water contact angle of perovskite/M138 (90.7°) is slightly decreased because of the EDOT core, which has two oxygen atoms. Therefore, the superior stability of doped M138-based PSCs can be partially attributed to a more stable perovskite/HTL interface as evidenced by Fig. 6d.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully designed and synthesized four new organic HTMs (M135–138) based on a low cost, stable and efficient methoxy-free donor indeno[2,1-b]carbazole. Due to the carbazole-fluorene hybrid structure, the indeno[2,1-b]carbazole HTMs exhibit a high Tg, uniform surface morphology and low HOMO level. In addition, a triple π-bridge strategy is introduced to construct high-efficiency methoxy-free donor-based HTMs. Compared with the indeno[2,1-b]carbazole HTMs with a unitary and binary bridge, those HTMs with a triple π-bridge demonstrated significantly enhanced hole transporting/extraction capability and minimized trap-assisted recombination. As a result, the PSC devices fabricated with M136 and M138 demonstrate outstanding PCEs of 20.56% and 21.37%, respectively, with good reproducibility. Importantly, the M138-based devices revealed an excellent long-term operational stability after aging for over 480 h. These results not only suggest the effectiveness of the triple π-bridge strategy for improving the performance of methoxy-free donor HTMs, but also demonstrate the promising applications of methoxy-free donor HTMs for efficient and stable PSCs.
