1. Introduction
The photocatalytic conversion of CO2 in the atmosphere to fuels and value-added chemicals represents a promising artificial carbon cycle to combat the global climate crisis1–4 but is both thermodynamically and dynamically challenging. With a high CO dissociation energy of ∼750 kJ mol−1, CO2 is extremely thermodynamically stable; from the dynamic perspective, the reaction involves multiple species and steps with the reaction time scale easily spanning over 10 orders of magnitude and typically involves the photoinduced generation of electrons and holes on the fs–ps scale, migration to the catalyst surface on the ps–μs scale, and the surface catalytic reaction time on the ms–s scale.5 Thus, accomplishing the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 is strongly reliant on efficient catalysts, i.e., with high selectivity, conversion rate, and robustness.6–8 For this purpose, the three crucial photocatalytic steps of light absorption, carrier transportation, and surface catalytic reactions should be focused upon. Specifically, for an ideal photocatalyst, the light-harvesting capability should be greatly enhanced, photogenerated carrier recombination should be prevented to achieve effective charge separation and transportation, and high selectivity of reduction products is required during surface reactions.9
Single semiconductors or even the band arrangement of a type I heterojunction are not usually conducive to photocatalysis because the photogenerated carriers are separated only briefly and then easily recombine to the ground state or in other narrow-band semiconductors in the latter case.10 Alternatively, to avoid the reaction termination and/or photocorrosion of materials caused by carrier accumulation, a type-II heterojunction is often employed, where the photogenerated holes and electrons move in the opposite direction to realize effective charge separation.10–13
Inorganic perovskite halide nanocrystals with tunable bandgaps, long carrier lifetimes, and high mobility14–19 have exhibited promising potential as a new type of photochemical conversion material.16,17,20–27 Herein, we used bismuth-based perovskite derivatives, as narrow-band semiconductors with excellent visible light absorption for CO2 photoreduction. Moreover, the materials are lead-free and have shown good performance as heterogeneous photocatalysts because of their good water stability and product selectivity.15,20,28–35 For instance, CO2 was reported to be strongly adsorbed on Cs3Bi2Br9 quantum dot (QD) catalyst surface via dual-site bonding, while the desorption of CO was easy and thus enhanced product selectivity.36,37
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely used in the reduction of CO2 because of their clear atomic structure adjustable active sites and large porosity for the adsorption of CO2.38–43 The large specific surface area and ordered pores of MOFs facilitate loading quantum dots to form QDs/MOF composites. Meanwhile, the close interfacial interaction between the QDs and MOFs enables ultrafast electron transfer and prevents the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. We then combined perovskites with MOFs to fabricate a type-II heterojunction for efficient electron–hole separation, which also had the additional merits of reducing the quantum dots aggregation and enhancing light absorption. Previously, our group reported an ultrafast cascade electron transfer of perovskite-based photocatalysts (CsPbBr3/CuTCPP MOF), which significantly enhanced the photocatalytic CO2 reduction efficiency.14 Based on this work, we have continued to choose perovskite/MOF composites as the catalyst to regulate the charge-transfer kinetics and product selectivity. MOF 525 Co was chosen for this study, in which each cobalt site is coordinated with the nitrogen atom in the porphyrin center to keep the active site monodisperse to avoid aggregation.44–46
As is well known, many of the previously proposed metal halide perovskite-based photocatalysts could perform photocatalytic reduction in solution.15,36,47 That the products CO and CH4 might also come from the oxidation of the solvent of ethyl acetate though is under debate.48,49 Hence, carrying out the photocatalytic reaction in a solid-phase system could not only exclude the solvent interference but also improve the catalyst stability. After factoring in the above considerations, herein we offer our strategy of fabricating a lead-free perovskite/MOF type-II heterojunction structure, which benefits from the narrow-band perovskite QDs for both efficient light trapping and selective CO2 adsorption and the coupling with the MOF to form a type-II heterojunction, which enables efficient electron–hole separation. The catalyst showed a remarkably high selectivity of 99.5% to the CO product under gas–solid phase conditions. A small amount of CH4 was also detected, indicating the catalyst well restrained the competitive H2 byproduct and thus enhanced the CO selectivity. We applied femtosecond transient absorption to unravel the efficient charge separation and ultrafast electron transfer from Cs3Bi2Br9 to MOF 525 Co within the heterojunction, which enabled efficient charge separation. Also, in situ infrared measurements disclosed the stronger CO2 adsorption, efficient conversion to *COOH intermediates and prompt CO desorption of the photocatalyst.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Material synthesis

2.1.1 Synthesis of Cs3Bi2Br9 quantum dots (QDs). 
Typically, the CsBr (192 mg, 0.9 mmol) and BiBr3 (269 mg, 0.6 mmol) were added to 20 mL DMSO and stirred to form a uniform precursor solution. Another 1 mL of the above precursor solution was injected into 50 mL isopropanol, and the solution became light green. The solution was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 3 min to remove the precipitation of large particles, and then centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 5 min to obtain yellowish-green Cs3Bi2Br9 QD (CBB).


2.1.2 Synthesis of MOF 525. 
MOF 525 samples were prepared according to a previous report.45 In the synthesis of MOF 525, zirconyl chloride octahydrate (12.5 mg, 0.037 mmol) was added to N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 10 mL) and sonicated for 30 min. Following sonication, tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)-porphyrin (2.5 mg, 0.037 mmol) was added to the solution. After 10 min further sonication, acetic acid (2.5 mL) was added to the solution. The solution was placed in a 25 mL scintillation vial and heated at 80 °C for 3 days. The microcrystalline powder was filtered and washed with DMF and acetone three times. Finally, the volatile acetone was removed by heating at 120 °C under vacuum for 2 days.


2.1.3 Synthesis of MOF 525 Co. 
Cobalt nitrate (70 mg) was dissolved in DMF (10 mL). MOF 525 (50 mg) was added to this solution, and the solution was heated at 100 °C for 48 h. The microcrystalline powder was collected by filtration and washed with DMF and acetone three times. Finally, the volatile acetone was removed by heating at 80 °C under vacuum for 2 days.


2.1.4 Synthesis of Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co. 
First, 192 mg of CsBr (0.9 mmol) and 269.0 mg of BiBr3 (0.60 mmol) were dissolved in 20 mL of DMSO to form a uniform Cs3Bi2Br9 precursor solution. Then, 4 mg MOF 525 Co powder was added to the above solution. Then, 1 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into isopropanol (50 mL) under vigorous stirring. Then, 1 min later, the obtained mixture was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 5 min. The same method was applied to synthesize two other Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co products with different mass ratios of MOF 525 Co by using 2.0 mg and 6.0 mg MOF 525 Co powder, respectively. Finally, Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co products with different weight ratios of Co element, 0.01%, 0.03%, 0.05% in total, respectively, were obtained.

2.2 Photocatalytic CO2 reduction
The whole photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction was carried out in a gas–solid system. The system consisted of a fully closed quartz reactor, a 300 W xenon lamp, and gas chromatograph. The light source was a xenon lamp equipped with an AM 1.5 G filter to simulate sunlight. The sunlight irradiated the surface of the sample vertically through the quartz container window, and its optical power was 100 mW cm−2. In order to eliminate the thermal effect in the irradiation process, the temperature of the reactor was kept at room temperature by circulating water. Next, 10 mg photocatalyst was dispersed in 1.0 mL toluene by ultrasonication. Then the mixed solution was coated on the surface of a quartz dish and further vacuum dried to remove external toluene to obtain a smooth surface catalyst film. Next, 1 mL water was added to the system as a proton source. Before illumination, pure CO2 was used instead of the reactor atmosphere for 20 min to remove O2 and other foreign gases. Finally, CO2 at standard atmospheric pressure was filled into the sealed reactor. During the reaction, the collected gas products were analyzed hourly using a GC instrument equipped with a hydrogen flame ionization detector (FID) with a converter. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC Model 7980A/MS Model 5975C, Agilent Technologies) was used to perform the isotope experiments for 13CO, 13CH4, and 18O2 generated from 13CO2, H218O, respectively.
2.3 
          In situ DRIFTS investigation into photocatalytic CO2 reduction

In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy measurements (in situ DRIFTS) were carried out on a commercial reactor (Praying Mantis HVC-DRP-5, Harrick) placed inside the infrared spectrometer (Bruker VERTEX 70). In the process of the in situ photocatalytic reaction, a xenon lamp was used to simulate natural light irradiation on the reactor. Before the in situ infrared test, the photocatalyst was heated in an Ar atmosphere at 120 °C for 1 h to remove surface pollutants. Then, 15 mg photocatalyst was put into a closed reactor, and a mixed gas containing CO2 and H2O vapor was filled into the reactor for 20 min, and the gas master valve was then closed. After reaching adsorption in 20 min, the background spectrum was collected again. Then, changes in the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectrum with time after illumination were recorded after turning on the xenon lamp (300 Xe, AM 1.5 G), and the transformation kinetics of the reactants under light was studied.
3. Results and discussion
The monodispersed Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs were synthesized through a modified anti-solvent recrystallization method under ambient conditions.36 The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images are presented in Fig. 1a, revealing that all the as-prepared Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs were spherical with a mean size of 2.1 ± 0.2 nm. MOF 525 was cubic shaped, and its morphology was maintained even after the introduction of Co coordination in the porphyrin center of MOF 525 (Fig. S1a and b†). As the pore size of MOF 525 Co was smaller than 2 nm,45,50 the Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs were uniformly distributed on the surface (not inside) of MOF 525 Co to form the composite catalyst, and the size of the quantum dots was basically unchanged (Fig. 1b). In the previous literature, the modification of quantum dots could increase the separation and transport of carriers and improve the catalytic performance.11,12 The lattice fringe of 0.56 nm was consistent with the (101) face of Cs3Bi2Br9 (Fig. 1c). The HAADF-mapping images further confirmed that the Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs were uniformly distributed in the MOF (Fig. 1d and Scheme S1†). The black spots in Fig. 1d are the defects of the as-prepared MOFs. It has been reported that defects can not only promote the separation of photogenerated charge, but also improve the photocatalytic performance.51 The above data evidenced that the Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co heterojunction was fabricated successfully. In addition, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) was applied to determine the mass fraction of Co element, which was 0.01%, 0.03%, and 0.05% in the three different composites, respectively. The one with 0.03 wt% Co demonstrated the best performance and was used as the representative for the characterizations.

The insets of 1a is the size histograms of Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs; (d) high-angle annular dark-field STEM image and elemental mapping images of Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co (0.03 wt% Co). 
We characterized the structure of MOF 525 and MOF 525 Co via X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, which showed that the diffraction peak of MOF 525 Co was consistent with that reported in the literature, and also that the coordination of the central cobalt atom did not affect the crystallinity of MOF 525 (Fig. S2a†). The metallization of the porphyrin centers in the MOF was confirmed by the UV-vis and FTIR spectra. It could be seen from the UV-vis spectra that the TCPP ligand had a strong S-band absorption at 420 nm and four weak Q bands at 515, 550, 592, and 646 nm, respectively. After the formation of MOF 525, there were a wide S band and four Q bands, characteristic of porphyrins. After the four nitrogen atoms in the center of the porphyrin ring had coordinated with Co to form MOF 525 Co, the Q band was reduced to two due to the change in the symmetry of the porphyrin units (Fig. S2b†). From the infrared spectra of MOF 525 and MOF 525 Co, it could be seen that the stretching peak of N–H bond at 3315 cm−1 disappeared. Compared with MOF 525, there was a vibrational peak for the Co–N bond at 1000 cm−1 (Fig. S2c†), which confirmed that a Co ion was successfully inserted into the center of MOF 525.
Further insight into the electron-transfer behavior was obtained through the photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiments (Fig. S2d†). When Zr6 clusters were introduced to form MOF 525, the fluorescence intensity of the porphyrin unit increased, indicative of the low energy-transfer efficiency between TCPP and the Zr6 clusters. With the addition of metal ions to the porphyrin ring to form MOF 525 Co, the fluorescence emission intensity of the porphyrin-cobalt unit was significantly quenched, which indicated that the recombination of photoexcited electron–hole pairs was significantly suppressed and the separation of electron–hole pairs was effectively improved, suggesting the central cobalt atom was very likely the active site (Fig. S2d†). Indeed, the active sites of catalysts are crucial for the photocatalytic reaction process.9 These results, combined with the FTIR and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) elemental analysis results, confirmed that Co atoms were successfully coordinated in the center of the porphyrin.
The XRD results showed that the pattern for the Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs matched that of the standard card (JCPDS No. 44-0714), indicating the high purity of the product. After the formation of Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co, the diffraction peaks in the composite were marked, and it was found that the crystallinity of the Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs was not affected (Fig. 2a). For the Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co (0.03 wt% Co) heterojunction, the characteristic absorption band edge of Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs appeared near 480 nm, which confirmed their existence on the surface of MOF 525 Co (Fig. 2b). Furthermore, the electronic structures of the constituent elements were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. 2c and d). In the Bi 4f XPS spectrum of Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co (0.03 wt% Co), two separate peaks at 159.38 and 164.71 eV were noted, belonging to 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 orbitals, respectively. Compared with pristine Cs3Bi2Br9, the Bi 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 peaks of Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co (0.03 wt% Co) were shifted to the right by 0.23 eV (Fig. 2c). The Br 3d characteristic peak of the composite were shifted to the right by 0.32 eV (Fig. 2d). Therefore, we speculated that there was a strong built-in electric field at the interface between the Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs and MOF 525 Co skeleton, facilitating the migration of interface electrons to improve the catalytic performance.

(e) Amperometric I–t curves plotted at an open circuit voltage under chopped AM 1.5 G illumination and (f) EIS Nyquist plots recorded under 100 mW cm−2 illumination at an open circuit voltage of Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs, MOF 525 Co, and Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co (0.03 wt% Co). 
Furthermore, the photoelectrochemical (PEC) performances were investigated by constructing a PEC cell. The amperometric I–t curves showed that the photocurrent remained stable when the light was turned on and off (Fig. 2e). Compared with Cs3Bi2Br9, the photocurrent value of Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co increased by 70% to 0.6 μA cm−2, which was consistent with the change in photocatalytic performance. The charge-transfer behavior of the two electrodes was further detected by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). As shown in Fig. 2f, the Nyquist curve showed that the charge-transfer resistance of Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co was significantly lower than that of Cs3Bi2Br9 alone, showing a smaller semi-circular arc at high frequency. This showed that the charge-transfer capacity of perovskite increased after the introduction of MOF 525 Co, and the charge-transfer resistance of the composite catalyst was significantly reduced.
The photocatalytic activity of Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs at the gas–solid interface was investigated under AM 1.5 G simulated sunlight. The main products were CO and trace CH4, but there were no liquid products. For instance, methanol and formic acid were not detected, consistent with previous reports.8,13 The control experiments in Fig. 3a and b implied that no products could be detected in the dark, demonstrating that both the photocatalyst and light irradiation are indispensable for the reaction. Fig. 3a shows the carbon dioxide reduction catalyzed by different ratios of Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co composite. At the optimum condition of MOF 525 Co (4 mg MOF, that is, 0.03 wt% Co), the reduction rates of CO2 conversion to CO and CH4 were the highest, which were 61.2 and 0.3 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively. In 7 h, the CO yield was 428 μmol g−1, and CH4 yield was 2.1 μmol g−1, and the CO selectivity was 99.5% (Fig. S3a, S3b†). For different proportions of Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co composite catalysts, CO and CH4 increased in different ranges with the prolongation of illumination time, and reached the maximum yield within 7 h (Fig. 3b). Under the same experimental conditions, we performed control experiments with MOF 525 and MOF 525 Co as the catalysts, which barely displayed any catalytic effects, with only negligible CH4 and CO detected (Fig. S3c†). Fig. 3c shows a comparison of the CO yields between Cs3Bi2Br9 and Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co within 20 h of irradiation. The CO yield of Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co (0.03 wt% Co) reached 536 μmol g−1 after steady growth, and the amount of CH4 reached 4.3 μmol g−1, indicating its high stability under long-term irradiation (Fig. S3d†).

(d) Gas chromatogram and mass spectra (GC-MS) analysis for the solar-driven reduction of 13CO2 to 13CH4 (m/z = 17) and 13CO (m/z = 29) using Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co (0.03 wt% Co) as a photocatalyst. (e) XRD spectra, DRS spectra (f), Cs 3d (g), Bi 4f (h), and Br 3d (i) of Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co (0.03 wt% Co) before and after photocatalytic reaction. 
The source of CH4 and CO products was determined through isotope experiments. In Fig. 3d, two signals at m/z 17 and m/z 29 appeared when 13CO2 was used as the gas source, evidencing that the CH4 and CO were from photocatalytic CO2 reduction. H218O was also oxidized to 18O2 (m/z = 36), which implied that photogenerated holes participated in the water oxidation (Fig. S4†). The stability of the photocatalyst was confirmed by XRD and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS) of the Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co (0.03 wt% Co) after the reaction (Fig. 3e and f). In the XRD patterns, the positions of each characteristic diffraction peak in the composite catalyst before and after catalysis were identical, indicating that the catalyst maintained a good crystal quality. The absorption peak at 455 nm of the catalyst remained in the DRS spectra after the reaction. Additionally, in the XPS spectra, the binding energies for Cs 3d (Fig. 3g), Bi 4f (Fig. 3h), and Br 3d (Fig. 3i) before and after the photocatalytic reaction only show negligible shifts (by 0.05, 0.04, and 0.15 eV, respectively), which was in agreement with previous results.52 The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) test demonstrated a significantly enhanced efficiency of 0.07% for the Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co (0.03 wt% Co) catalyst compared with 0.046% for the pristine Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs (see the calculation process in the ESI†). Table S1† presents a comprehensive comparison with the recent results for metal halide perovskites for CO2 photocatalytic reduction, where it can be seen that the Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co (0.03 wt% Co) in this work showed high product selectivity and an efficient conversion rate under similar experimental conditions.
The band gaps of catalysts also play an important role in photocatalytic activity, and the relative positions of the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) are associated with the reaction activity. Usually, a more negative CB band implies a stronger reduction capability of the photoexcited electron. In order to understand the relationship between the electronic band structure and photoreduction activity of Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs and MOF 525 Co, the relative positions of the conduction band and valence band were further determined according to the previously reported method. Fig. S5a and b† show the bandgap of Cs3Bi2Br9 (2.62 eV). MOF 525 Co could be regarded as a direct band gap semiconductor, and the band gap value was determined to be 2.05 eV. The Fermi level (EF) and the valence band energy (EVB) level of Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs and MOF 525 Co were measured via ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). As shown in Fig. S5c and d,†EF was 3.25 eV with the cut-off energy of 17.95 eV. Next, EVB − EF was determined by linear extrapolation in the low-binding-energy region, and EVB was estimated to be −5.6 eV, and hence the conduction band energy (ECB) was −3.02 eV (EVB + Eg) (Fig. S5†). Likewise, EF for MOF 525 Co was −1.9 eV, EVB was −5.7 eV, and ECB was −3.6 eV (Fig. S5†), which were in agreement with those in the previous literature. The above results corroborated that MOF 525 Co and the Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs formed a type-II heterojunction. Consequently, this was thermodynamically favorable for electrons to transfer from the photoexcited QDs to the MOFs for CO2 reduction (Fig. S6†).
Next, transient absorption (TA) measurements were employed to disentangle the multiple dynamic steps during the photocatalytic cycle. Contour maps of the transient absorption spectra of the Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs and Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co (0.03 wt% Co) are shown in Fig. 4a, b, d and e. Correspondingly, Fig. 4c and f display the representative decay curves for Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs and Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co, respectively. Clearly, both exhibited pronounced negative peaks at ∼450–455 nm, attributed to the ground-state bleaching (GSB) bands. Likewise, both displayed positive peaks at ∼470 nm, assigned to the excited states absorption (ESA) bands. Charge-separation/transfer/recombination would lead to a decrease in excited states absorption (ESA) and manifest itself as GSB recovery.
 Fig. 4  Contour maps of the transient absorption spectra of Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs (a), Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co (0.03 wt% Co) (d) excited at 400 nm; representative spectra at different delay times for Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs (b) and Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co (0.03 wt% Co) (e) in the range of 500 fs to 5 ns. Decay curves were normalized to the maximum signals at wavelengths of ∼450 nm (c) and ∼470 nm (f). 
At 455 nm, three lifetime components of Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs were extracted: 2.9 ps (55.7%) for the hot carrier relaxation time, 45.9 ps (29%) for carrier transfer to the trap state; and > ns (15.3%) for carrier recombination from the trap state to the ground state14,53 (Fig. 4c and Table S2†). By contrast, the Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co (0.03 wt% Co) heterojunction exhibited similar GSB recovery dynamics, but the carrier transfer time to the trap state was significantly reduced to 34.3 ps (Fig. 4c and Table S2†). The decreased lifetime reflected the electron-transfer rate from the Cs3Bi2Br9 to the MOF 525 Co section, and was estimated to be 1.36 × 10−10 S−1, i.e., 136 ps by using the equation k = 1/τ − 1/τ0.14,54 Analysis of the ∼470 nm ESA dynamics of Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs and the Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co showed similar trends. For instance, carrier transfer to the trap state time occurred at 40.6 ps for Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs, consistent with the observed 45.9 ps from GSB fitting for the quantum dots. Likewise, for the heterojunction, the 40.6 ps component was reduced to 22.3 ps due to the occurrence of electron transfer (Fig. 4f and Table S2†).
The above result disclosed the interfacial electron transfer between the perovskite QDs and the MOF. To further disclose the subsequent internal electron transfers within the MOF structure, the excited-state properties dynamics of the TCPP and MOF 525 units were systematically compared (Fig. S7 and Table S3†). The TA spectra of TCPP exhibited ESA peaks of the Soret band at 472 nm, and overlapping GSB and ESA peaks of Q bands over 500 nm, including those for the Q1 band at 518 nm and Q2 band at 554 nm (Fig. S7a†).14,55 Compared to TCPP, MOF 525 showed red-shifted GSB peaks of the Soret band at 472 nm, and corresponding GSB peaks of Q1 bands at 532 nm and Q2 bands at 567 nm (Fig. S7c†), in agreement with the steady-state state absorption spectra (Fig. S2b†). The fitting of the ESA peaks of the Soret band at 472 nm for TCPP gave rise to 2 components at 124 fs and a long one >ns, attributed to the fast S2 → S1 and recombination to the ground state (S1 → S0), respectively (Fig. S7b†); by contrast, MOF 525 demonstrated 3 components at 7.1 ps, 133 ps, and >ns, assigned to S2 → S1, electron transfer from porphyrin ligands to Zr-oxo cluster, and charge recombination, respectively (Fig. S8†). The results are summarized in Fig. S7 and Table S3.† Fitting of the GSB peaks of the Q1 and Q2 bands of MOF 525 gave similar results. Moreover, the charge separation within MOF 525 was further evidenced by the ESA peaks in the region >700 nm, as the absorption of one electron oxidized TCPP*+ in both the TA spectra of MOF 525 (779 nm peak) and TCPP (773 nm peak) (Fig. S7d†).55,56 Likewise, the long recombination time over the ns time scale implied the capacity of the photocatalyst to suppress the recombination of electrons and holes to boost the catalytic activities.

In situ DRIFTS was employed to explore the pathways of CO2 adsorption and activation on Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co (0.03 wt% Co). Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co (0.03 wt% Co) was first exposed to a CO2/H2O gas mixture to reach adsorption equilibrium, and then illuminated by light for 60 min, during which the DRIFTS spectra were collected every 2 min (Fig. 5). The dynamic infrared spectra certified that several carbonates and active ˙CO2 intermediates were formed on the surface of Cs3Bi2Br9 and Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co (0.03 wt% Co) during the humid CO2 adsorption process in the dark. The peaks at around 2360 and 2341 cm−1 were attributed to ν3(CO2) absorption of the surface CO2 molecule (Fig. 5b and e). Note that for the peaks around 3530 and 3728 cm−1, weak overtone bands of the adsorbed gas-phase CO2 also appeared, and surface-bonded OH− stemming from the adsorbed H2O (∼3500 cm−1) could also be detected (Fig. 5a and d). These results showed that Cs3Bi2Br9 and Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co (0.03 wt% Co) adsorbed carbon dioxide and water on their surfaces. In particular, the peaks around 1610–1689 were the characteristic vibration modes of ˙CO2−, the appearance of which suggested the activation of the adsorbed CO2 on the surface of the Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co (0.03 wt% Co) catalyst (Fig. 5c). By contrast, these absorption peaks were absent on the surface of pristine Cs3Bi2Br9 (Fig. 5f). Moreover, the peaks near 1559, 1541 cm−1 and 1304–1340 cm−1 belonged to the bidentate carbonate species (b-CO32−), implying the efficient activation and conversion of the adsorbed CO2 into bidentate carbonate based on the robust dual-sites-bonding model on the Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co surface.36 The peak at 1734 cm−1 corresponded to a chelated bridged carbonate (c-CO32−), indicative of the formation of carbonic acid and the adsorption of CO2 on the catalyst surface. The interaction between CO2 and water adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst produced HCO3−, the absorption of which was located at ∼1396–1420 cm−1. Compared with the Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co (0.03 wt% Co) catalyst, some intermediates had disappeared in the Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs spectrum in the range of 1800–1200 cm−1 in the dark, corroborating that the composite catalyst was more beneficial for the catalytic conversion of CO2.

Fig. 6 shows the evolution of surface species under constant irradiation after reaching adsorption equilibrium in the dark state. The spectral peak evolution of the in situ FTIR spectra provided crucial information on the intermediates in the catalytic process. The absorption peaks of surface-bound OH− and weakly adsorbed gas-phase CO2 were located around 3400–3600 cm−1, while the peaks around 1677, 1204, and 1190 cm−1 could be attributed to the bending vibration of CO2 (Fig. 6a and c).57 The absorption peak in the range of 2400–2300 cm−1 indicated the adsorption capacity of the catalyst for CO2, evidencing that the Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co (0.03 wt% Co) composite had a strong adsorption capacity for CO2 (Fig. 6b and e). In addition, the peaks at 1284–1365 cm−1 belonged to the b-CO32− intermediate, and the peaks at 1424–1390 cm−1 belonged to the vibration of HCO3− (Fig. 6c and f). The absorption peaks at 1724 and 1557 cm−1 arose from the *COOH intermediate, while the peak at 1709 cm−1 belonged to CO*. The appearance of these intermediates further illustrated the catalytic conversion process of CO2. Most of the peaks on the Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co (0.03 wt% Co) catalyst showed a much stronger intensity and could be clearly identified. Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF525 Co (0.03 wt% Co) exhibited a more efficient photoreduction capability than Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs. For instance, note that the m-CO32−intermediate occupied the surface of Cs3Bi2Br9 without timely conversion, slowing down the catalytic reaction rate of CO2 on Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs and resulting in a low CO yield. Generally, the above observations suggested that the existence of Zr6 clusters and central Co as catalytic active sites boosted the reaction activity of Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co (0.03 wt% Co), enabling fast CO2 adsorption equilibrium and efficient conversion of the intermediate species.

The proposed photocatalytic cycle is shown in Fig. 7. Upon photoexcitation, ultrafast electron transfer occurs at ∼136 ps from Cs3Bi2Br9 to MOF 525 Co within the Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co (0.03 wt% Co) catalyst and activates the surface-adsorbed CO2 to form *CO2−, accompanied by the dissociation of adsorbed H2O molecules into H+ and OH−. The b-CO32− intermediate species formed by the reaction of CO2 and the surface-bonded OH− are then protonated into the key intermediate *COOH, which can be either reduced to CO* or CH3O*, with the former leading to the CO product and the latter to the CH4 product. Based on the in situ infrared spectral measurements, the amount of CH3O* intermediate was too small be detected. On the other hand, CO may also undergo further hydrogenation into formyl radicals and eventually CH4,58,59 but the weak adsorption of CO on the Bi-perovskite-based photocatalyst accelerated CO desorption and enhanced the CO selectivity.60 Therefore for the Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co catalyst, the selectivity to CO was extremely high and the CH4 byproduct was negligible. The specific reaction path is also provided in Scheme S2.†61,62

4. Conclusions
In summary, we developed an in situ assembly strategy to fabricate the lead-free perovskite Cs3Bi2Br9/MOF 525 Co type-II heterojunction to reduce CO2, which showed a 99.5% high selectivity to CO under gas–solid phase conditions. The electron consumption rate for carbon dioxide conversion reached 124.8 μmol g−1 h−1 (61.2 μmol g−1 h−1 for CO, and 0.3 μmol g−1 h−1 for CH4), superior to many previous reports. The in situ DRIFTS confirmed the strong CO2 adsorption of the catalyst and that the primary intermediate was *COOH. The transient absorption measurements revealed the ultrafast electron transfer between Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs and MOF 525 Co within the heterojunction, enabling efficient charge separation with a long carrier lifetime over the ns time scale. This work elucidates the underlying mechanism accounting for the high product selectivity, providing a guideline for the design of efficient catalysts from the perspectives of the dynamics and surface reaction activity.
