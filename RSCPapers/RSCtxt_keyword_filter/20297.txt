    , Accepted 23rd February 2020First published on 24th February 2020AbstractThe low photovoltaic performance of 2D perovskites, which is caused by high exciton binding energy and wide band gaps, has limited their further development and applications. Here, we adopted a new-type strategy to obtain high-quality 2-hydroxyethylamine (HEA)-based quasi-2D perovskite films by incorporating halogenated second spacer cations. Due to the effective passivation of halogenated benzylammonium cations with enhanced electronegativity, the mixed quasi-2D perovskites displayed superior crystallinity and reduced internal defects, leading to an enhanced charge transfer and suppressive carrier recombination. As a result, significantly improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 15.19% to 18.75% with an enhanced open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) was achieved. After aging at 85 °C for 200 h and 45 ± 5% relative humidity (RH) for 1500 h, the unencapsulated optimal devices retained 81% and 90% of the initial PCE, respectively. Our study provides an effective and simple strategy to improve the photovoltaic performance and environmental stability of 2D perovskites for commercial applications.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic metal halide perovskites (such as MAPbX3), which display excellent optical and electrical properties, have achieved huge success in the field of photoelectric devices and their certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) has exceeded 25%.1–5 Although the PCE of three-dimensional (3D) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is rapidly improving, their instability under humidity, oxygen, heat, and light is still a challenge, which has hindered their widespread use in practical devices.6–11
In recent years, researchers had worked a lot to solve the problem of instability in PSCs.12–16 In particular, two-dimensional (2D) perovskites have been widely studied due to their dramatically superior stability in contrast to 3D perovskites and become promising photoelectric absorption materials.17–25 Up to now, 2D perovskites based on different organic ammonium salts have been successively studied, such as (BA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 Ruddlesden–Popper (R–P) 2D perovskite,17 (PhC2H5NH3)2(CH3NH3)2Pb3I10 2D-layered perovskite,18 (IC2H4NH3)2(CH3NH3)n−1PbnI3n+1 mixed-dimensional (MD) perovskite,19 TEA-based 2D/3D perovskite and (PDMA)FA2Pb3I10 Dion–Jacobson (D–J) 2D perovskite.20,21 Despite displaying high stability, 2D perovskites presented poor photovoltaic performances due to their poor crystallinity, low charge transport and high trap density. Hence, it remains a great challenge to improve the photovoltaic performance of 2D perovskite devices for further commercial applications.
At present, many approaches have been developed to enhance the PCE of 2D PSCs, including additive assistant, hot-casting and solvent engineering.17,26–30 Li et al. obtained high-performance layered RP-based (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 PSCs with a PCE of 14.9% by doping Li+.31Via the synergistic exploitation of NH4Cl and DMSO, Liang et al. prepared highly efficient R–P 2D perovskite (PEA)2MA3Pb4I13 with a significant PCE of up to 13.41%.32 Liu et al. demonstrated the R–P/3D heterostructure PSCs combined with molecule passivation delivering a PCE as high as 20.62%.33 However, most of these methods are devoted to improve the PCE of butylammonium (BA) or phenylethylammonium (PEA)-based 2D PSCs; thus, it is still necessary to explore new strategies to achieve high-efficiency 2D perovskite devices based on other potential ammonium salts.
Herein, we employed a new strategy to improve the PCE of low-efficiency 2-hydroxyethylamine (HEA)-based quasi-2D perovskite materials (n = 9) by incorporating halogenated 4-fluorobenzylammonium (FBA) and 4-chlorobenzylammonium (CBA) as second spacer cations. The superior crystal orientation, smoother surface, remarkably prolonged carrier lifetime and lower trap density of (HEA0.9CBA0.1)2(Cs0.1FA0.9)8Pb9(I0.95Br0.05)28 (0.1CBA) and (HEA0.9FBA0.1)2(Cs0.1FA0.9)8Pb9(I0.95Br0.05)28 (0.1FBA) perovskite films indicate the excellent passivation effects of halogenated benzylammonium-based aromatic cations. The results reveal that the 0.1CBA-based quasi-2D PSCs achieve a superior PCE of 18.75%. More importantly, the stability of the 0.1CBA and 0.1FBA perovskite devices under humidity is prominently enhanced, which can retain 90% of the initial values after aging for 1500 h under 45 ± 5% RH. This study demonstrated that the halogenated benzylammonium-based aromatic cation can be a unique alternative cation to passivate the defects and the strategy can generally be applied to other quasi-2D perovskite optoelectronic devices.
Results and discussion
In this study, we employed the component of (HEA)2(Cs0.1FA0.9)8Pb9(I0.95Br0.05)28 (denoted as HEA, 2-hydroxyethylamine) a quasi-2D perovskite system as an absorber layer. The 2D perovskite structure of (HEA)2PbI4 has been demonstrated in literature and our previous work.34,35 Then, the halogenated benzylammonium-based aromatic cations, 4-fluorobenzylammonium (FBA) and 4-chlorobenzylammonium (CBA), were used as second spacer cations to improve the performance of quasi-2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on the general formula [(HEA)1−x(A)x]2(Cs0.1FA0.9)8Pb9(I0.95Br0.05)28. When x is 0.1, the component is labeled as 0.1A (A = CBA or FBA).
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded to study the changes in the crystal structure of quasi-2D perovskites. Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of HEA, 0.1CBA and 0.1FBA perovskite films. The XRD patterns of all the perovskite films exhibit the characteristic peaks of 3D perovskite, corresponding to the (110), (202) (220), (310) crystal planes. In addition, new diffraction peaks arise at about 8.9°, implying the formation of 2D perovskite phase.20–22 The HEA perovskite film displays a strong characteristic peak of PbI2 near 12.7°, declaring the existence of unreacted PbI2 in the HEA film, which reduces its tendency of light absorption. However, after incorporating the second spacer cation to partially replace HEA+, the intensities of the 3D perovskite characteristic peaks significantly increased and the intensity of the characteristic peak for PbI2 dramatically decreased. From the magnified XRD patterns of HEA, 0.1CBA and 0.1FBA perovskite films in Fig. 1b and c, it can be observed that the peaks of 0.1CBA and 0.1FBA perovskite films display obvious shift to large angles, owing to the larger ionic sizes of CBA and FBA leading to slight changes in the lattice constants of the perovskite crystal. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the perovskite films on the (110) and (220) crystal planes were calculated and are shown in Fig. 1d. It can be found that the FWHM of 0.1CBA and 0.1FBA perovskite films are obviously lower than that of the HEA film, which further verified the preferable crystal structure. Then, the top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of HEA, 0.1CBA and 0.1FBA perovskite films were recorded to study the effects of the incorporation of second spacer cation on the surface morphology of quasi-2D perovskite films. As shown in Fig. 1e–g, compared with the HEA perovskite film, 0.1CBA and 0.1FBA perovskite films display smoother and non-porous surface and more uniform particle sizes. In particular, the 0.1CBA film has a better surface morphology, which is consistent with the XRD patterns.

Fig. 2a and c exhibit the UV-vis absorption spectra and steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of HEA, 0.1CBA and 0.1FBA perovskite films. As can be seen in Fig. 2a, when the second spacer cation (CBA or FBA) was introduced, the absorption edges of quasi-2D perovskite films showed slight blue shift, which is consistent with the previous reports and resulted in a slightly increased band gap (Fig. 2b).19,20 However, the absorption intensities of the two perovskite films were significantly enhanced owing to the excellent crystal structure, while the quasi-2D perovskite film with 0.1CBA displayed strongest absorption intensity from 500 to 700 nm. The positions of the steady-state PL peaks slightly blue-shifted and the results are in good agreement with the UV-vis absorption spectra. The steady-state PL spectra can also be used to study their charge dynamics. It can be found that the incorporation of CBA and FBA can improve the PL intensities of quasi-2D perovskite films, indicating that they own high film quality and significantly reduced internal defects.

Furthermore, the internal charge transport and carrier recombination properties of quasi-2D perovskite films and devices were studied by transient absorption (TA) responses and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The normalized TA responses of HEA, 0.1CBA and 0.1FBA perovskite films are shown in Fig. 2c. Herein, the single exponential decay function (y = A1 × exp(−x/t1) + y0) is adopted to fit the normalized TA curves and the detailed fitted carrier lifetime (t1) value is obtained. The carrier lifetimes of three quasi-2D perovskite films are 37.00 ns, 58.29 ns and 52.26 ns, respectively. Clearly, the 0.1CBA perovskite film exhibits the longest carrier lifetime, demonstrating its faster charge transfer rate and higher film quality. Fig. 2d displays the Nyquist plots of HEA, 0.1CBA and 0.1FBA perovskite devices at V = −0.8 V (in dark) to further understand the charge transfer and carrier recombination behaviors inside the devices. In the Nyquist plots, a semicircle representing carrier recombination resistance (Rrec) can be seen at high frequencies. It can be clearly observed that the 0.1CBA and 0.1FBA perovskite devices exhibit larger Rrec than the HEA PSCs, which implies that the incorporation of the second spacer cation is conducive to reducing the Rrec inside the devices. In particular, after the incorporation of CBA, the Rrec value of the quasi-2D perovskite device is greatly reduced, which is in favor of the improvement of device performance.
The light intensity (φ)-dependent Voc properties were studied to survey the main charge recombination behavior in the quasi-2D devices based on the equation Voc = α(kBT/q)lnφ, where kB is the Boltzmann's constant, T is the Kelvin temperature, and q is the elementary charge. When the slope reached to 2kBT/q, it indicated that the trap-assisted recombination is the more dominant carrier recombination channel in the devices; whereas a slope of kBT/q signifies ideal trap-assisted recombination.36,37 The slope factors of HEA, 0.1CBA and 0.1FBA perovskite devices are determined to be 1.86kBT/q, 1.40kBT/q and 1.45kBT/q depending on the Vocversus light intensity of different devices as shown in Fig. 2f. It indicates that the trap-assisted non-radiative recombination is significantly inhibited in the 0.1CBA and 0.1FBA quasi-2D perovskites, resulting in enhanced Voc and FF for corresponding devices.
Subsequently, we employed the space charge limiting (SCLC) measurements to gain the trap densities of the quasi-2D perovskites. According to the equation Nt = 2VTFLεrε0/(qL2), we can calculate the trap densities (Nt) of HEA, 0.1CBA and 0.1FBA perovskite films. In the equation, VTFL represents the trap-filled limit voltage, which can be obtained from the J–V curves of HEA, 0.1CBA and 0.1FBA perovskites with the architecture of glass/FTO/TiO2/perovskite/PCBM/Au (electron-only), εr is the relative dielectric constant of perovskite, ε0 is the vacuum dielectric constant, L is the film thickness of a perovskite layer and q is the elementary charge of the electron. As shown in Fig. 3a–c, the VTFL values of HEA, 0.1CBA and 0.1FBA perovskite devices are about 0.45, 0.20 and 0.24 V, respectively, and the thickness of the three quasi-2D perovskite films are 487, 502 and 514 nm, respectively (Fig. S2†). After calculating, the trap densities (Nt) of HEA, 0.1CBA and 0.1FBA perovskite films came out to be 7.35 × 1015, 3.69 × 1015 and 3.01 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. The results demonstrate that the incorporation of the second spacer cation into the HEA quasi-2D perovskite materials can play a great role in passivation and effectively reduce the trap density, which is resulted from the special chemical structure of benzene and high electronegative atoms F and Cl in the second spacer cation. According to the XPS spectra of Pb 4f for 0.1CBA and 0.1FBA perovskite films in Fig. 3d, both the peaks of Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 display a shift to high-energy direction compared to HEA, indicating a different chemical environment caused by the generation of the ionic bonds between the halogen atoms and lead atoms (Fig. 3g). It can be found in Fig. 3e and f that the fluorine and chlorine elements are distributed uniformly and the existence of hydrogen between the halogen atoms and hydrogen atoms from organic cations and the ionic bond can bring about effective passivation in the mixed quasi-2D perovskites.38 In addition, the enhanced electronegativity of CBA and FBA can adjust the dipole moment of organic layers and reduce the difference in values of dielectric constant between the organic spacer cation and inorganic layers. Therefore, the coulomb screening of electrons and holes in the inorganic framework could be effectively increased, as depicted in Fig. 3h.39,40

The photovoltaic performances of three quasi-2D PSCs were determined based on the conventional mesoscopic perovskite devices with FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD/Au structure (Fig. 4a). The corresponding cross-sectional SEM images of 0.1FBA and 0.1CBA devices, which own uniform and compact morphology are shown in Fig. 4b. Fig. 4c exhibits the current–voltage (J–V) curves of HEA, 0.1CBA and 0.1FBA perovskite devices. The HEA perovskite device made from (HEA)2(Cs0.1FA0.9)8Pb9(I0.9Br0.1)28 shows a Voc of 1.12 V, a Jsc of 20.12 mA cm−2, an FF of 67.56% and a PCE of 15.19%. After the incorporation of the second spacer cation CBA or FBA, the Voc, Jsc and FF of the 0.1CBA and 0.1FBA quasi-2D perovskite devices are significantly increased, resulting in effectively improved PCEs due to the high-quality 0.1CBA and 0.1FBA perovskite films with faster charge transfer rate, slower electron and hole recombination and reduced internal defects. 0.1CBA shows the best photovoltaic performance with a Voc of 1.14 V, a Jsc of 21.75 mA cm−2 and an FF of 75.39%, thus achieving a high PCE of 18.75% with an improvement of 20%. In Fig. 4b, the IPCE spectra of HEA, 0.1CBA and 0.1FBA perovskite devices were recorded and the actual Jsc of three quasi-2D PSCs was obtained through integration. In contrast to HEA devices, 0.1CBA and 0.1FBA perovskite devices display higher IPCE values from 350 to 750 nm. The actual Jsc values of the HEA, 0.1CBA and 0.1FBA perovskite cells were calculated to be 19.27, 20.08 and 20.83 mA cm−2, respectively, which matched well with the Jsc acquired from the J–V curves shown in Fig. 4c.

Hysteresis is a phenomenon often appearing in the J–V curves of mesoscopic PSCs; thus, hysteresis is also the main parameter to inspect the performances of perovskite devices. Herein, we also tested the J–V curves of three quasi-2D perovskite devices under the reverse and forward scan directions to compare their hysteresis behaviors. The results are shown in Fig. 4c and S3.† The hysteresis factor (HI) can be calculated according to Table S2† and the formula (PCEreverse − PCEforward)/PCEreverse. The PCE of HEA perovskite device is 15.19% for reverse direction and 13.31% for forward direction with a hysteresis factor of 12.38%. The 0.1FBA perovskite device has a hysteresis factor of 6.40%, while the 0.1 CBA PSCs own a small change of PCE from 18.75% to 18.09% with a low hysteresis factor of 3.52%. It indicates that the incorporation of the second spacer cation CBA or FBA can not only improve the PCE but also can effectively reduce the perovskite hysteresis of the mesoscopic PSCs owing to the decrease in trap density.41 Moreover, the steady-state measurements of the three PSCs were studied to characterize the stabilized power output. As shown in Fig. 4f, the 0.1FBA and 0.1CBA devices present stable PCE of 17.93% at a bias of 0.91 V and 16.78% at a bias of 0.89 V, respectively, which is 14.02% for HEA at a bias of 0.81 V.
In addition, we have summarized the photovoltaic parameters of 30 devices for HEA, 0.1CBA and 0.1FBA perovskite devices, and the distributions of Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE are displayed in Fig. 4g–j. It can be seen that the average Voc, Jsc and FF of 0.1CBA and 0.1FBA perovskite devices have prominently increased and the distributions of Voc and FF are more concentrated compared to HEA perovskite devices. Therefore, the final average PCE of the 0.1CBA and 0.1FBA perovskite devices is markedly increased and their distributions are more concentrated. In particular, the average PCE of 0.1CBA perovskite devices increases from 14.52% for HEA to 16.91%. It shows that the quasi-2D perovskite devices have high PCE and repeatability, which further displays its superior photovoltaic performance.
The stability of quasi-2D PSCs when exposed to moisture and heat was further measured. As shown in Fig. 5a, the unencapsulated 0.1CBA and 0.1FBA devices respectively can keep 90% and 85% of the initial PCE after aging at 45 ± 5% RH in dark for 1500 h, which is 55% for the HEA devices. The enhanced humidity stability of 0.1CBA and 0.1FBA is due to their improved hydrophobicity and better film quality, which can also be confirmed by the water contact angle measurements, as shown in Fig. 5g–i. To further verify the improved moisture resistance of 0.1CBA and 0.1FBA perovskite films, the XRD patterns after aging under 45 ± 5% RH for 1000 h are shown in Fig. 5b, c and S4.† The strong diffraction peak of PbI2 can be found in the HEA film, accompanied by a significant weakening of the perovskite peak, while the 0.1CBA and 0.1 FBA films still maintain the outstanding perovskite diffraction peaks. Furthermore, the unencapsulated 0.1CBA and 0.1FBA devices also displayed prominent thermal stability, compared to HEA when aged at 85 °C for 200 h (Fig. 5d), which can also be confirmed from the UV-vis absorption spectra of perovskite films during the aging process (Fig. 5e, f and S5†). The significantly improved the environmental stability of mixed quasi-2D perovskites is conducive to further promotion and application.

Conclusion
In summary, we reported highly efficient and stable quasi-2D perovskite devices by introducing halogenated 4-fluorobenzylammonium (FBA) and 4-chlorobenzylammonium (CBA) as second spacer cations into the (HEA)2(Cs0.1FA0.9)8Pb9(I0.95Br0.05)28 perovskite. As a result, owing to the passivation effects of CBA and FBA, the quasi-2D perovskites showed excellent properties with better crystallinity, smoother surface, and higher light absorption ability, leading to effectively reduced trap densities and increased charge transfer. The mixed quasi-2D perovskite devices displayed improved PCE and environmental stability. In particular, the 0.1CBA quasi-2D perovskite device exhibited the highest PCE of 18.75% and maintained 90% of the initial values after 1500 h of aging under 45 ± 5% RH. Our study provides an effective and meaningful method to further improve the PCE and stability of quasi-2D perovskite materials.
