    , Accepted 27th November 2022First published on 5th December 2022AbstractIn recent years, inorganic halide perovskites have attracted significant attention in the field of photovoltaics (PVs) because of their excellent intrinsic thermal stability and promising theoretical power conversion efficiency (PCE).

1 Introduction
Over the past decade, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as promising technology of the future to present the third generation of photovoltaic devices. Metal halide perovskite materials possess excellent optoelectronic properties, such as strong light absorption ability, tunable optical bandgaps, long carrier diffusion length, and high tolerance to defects.1–6 It is noteworthy that Miyasaka et al. used a halide perovskite material for the first time as a photo-absorber layer in a PV device and reported a PCE of 3.8% in 2009.7 Since then, the PCE of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (OIH-PSCs) has reached over 25%8–15 by developing the device architecture, film fabrication process, and interface engineering. OIH-PSCs are comprised of a light-absorbing layer with the general chemical formula ABX3, where A is methylammonium (CH3NH3+, MA+), formamidinium (HC(NH2)2+, FA+) or their mixture. However, because of the volatile nature of the organic components MA+ and FA+, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite semiconductors have potential long-term instability issues in PV applications.16
Thus, for the commercialization of perovskite PV devices, the instability of OIH-PSCs has attracted extensive attention.16–18 When the organic component is completely replaced by the inorganic cesium (Cs+) ion to form inorganic cesium lead halide perovskite materials (CsPbX3), this instability problem is substantially solved. These materials exhibit strong resistance to high temperatures due to the lack of hygroscopic and volatile organic cations.19–22 In 2015, it was demonstrated that organic components are not necessary to achieve efficient inorganic perovskite solar cells.23 In 2016, the PCE of mixed-halide IPSCs based on the first CsPbIBr2 and the first CsPbI2Br was reported to be 4.7%24 and close to 10%,25 respectively. CsPbI3 (bandgap (Eg): ∼1.7 eV) shows great potential as a candidate material for PV applications. However, bulk CsPbI3 films display low phase stability and rapidly transform into a non-perovskite orthorhombic phase (Eg: ∼2.82 eV).26–29 In addition, IPSCs based on the large Eg of CsPbBr3 (Eg: ∼2.25 eV) exhibit a low PV performance owing to their limited light absorption capacity.30,31 Fortunately, bromide ions can partially replace iodide in CsPbI3 to form mixed-halide perovskites, which can better balance the phase stability and efficiency of PV devices. The mixed-halide CsPbI2Br perovskite has attracted significant attention due to the stabilization of the black phase by partially replacing I− with the smaller Br− and then increasing Goldschmidt's tolerance factor (t). In addition, the cubic-phase CsPbI2Br perovskite has a suitable optical bandgap (Eg: 1.8–1.9 eV) and exhibits great potential for use in multi-junction tandem and semi-transparent solar cells.32 More importantly, the CsPbI2Br perovskite can still maintain the photoactive black phase at room temperature (RT), but it will inevitably transform to a non-perovskite phase in a humid environment.
However, despite the significant progress in efficiency and stability, the highest PCE of CsPbI2Br IPSCs has only reached about 70% of the Shockley–Queisser (S–Q) theoretical limit (Fig. 1b).33–37 CsPbI2Br IPSCs have several problems that restrict device performance, such as large energy loss38,39 and energy level mismatch with the carrier transport layers (CTLs).40 The open-circuit voltage (Voc) loss (>0.5 V) is the main obstacle in further improving the efficiency of IPSCs, which is much higher than that of OIH-PSCs (∼0.3 V). This is mainly attributed to the defects produced during the crystallization process of perovskite films, which act as non-radiative recombination centers and obstruct the improvement in PV performance.41 Hence, high-quality perovskite films with compact grains and few defects are essential for efficient IPSCs. To resolve the above-mentioned issues, a series of strategies have been proposed, such as optimizing the preparation process,42,43 modulating the composition,44,45 modifying the interface,46–48 and developing novel CTLs.49,50 The first reported PCE of CsPbI2Br IPSCs was 9.8%, which increased to 17.5% in just a few years.51 Composition/crystallization optimization and interface engineering have played important roles in improving their environmental stability and achieving a higher PV performance. For example, the incorporation of K+/Rb+ ions in the CsPbI2Br perovskite results in the volume contraction of the PbX6 octahedrons, consequently improving its phase stability and reducing the defect density. Furthermore, the addition of additives to the CsPbI2Br perovskite precursor can effectively control the crystallization of the perovskite, subsequently obtaining high-quality CsPbI2Br film. Tetramethylammonium chloride (TMACl)-passivated SnO2 as the electron transport layer (ETL) not only can reduce the traps density in the ETL but also reduce its work function and build a suitable energy level alignment between CsPbI2Br and the ETL, thus boosting the electron transport at the interface. Interface engineering between the perovskite films and the hole transport layer (HTL) or ETL can result in well-matched energy level alignment and passivation of defects, thus effectively inhibiting the interfacial recombination and reducing the energy loss.

Herein, in this review, we highlight the latest progress on mixed-halide CsPbI2Br perovskite for PV application. High-performance CsPbI2Br IPSCs can be fabricated via effective approaches, such as deposition process optimization, crystallization regulation, composition engineering, and interface modulation (Fig. 1a). The stability and efficiency of CsPbI2Br solar cells can be improved through the synergistic effect of these strategies. Thus, the deposition approaches, doping strategies, crystallization, and interface engineering for CsPbI2Br-IPSCs are systematically summarized. Furthermore, the influence mechanism of crystallization/interface engineering on high-quality CsPbI2Br films and high-performance solar cell devices is analyzed and emphasized. Finally, some promising directions toward further promoting the PV performance and realizing the commercialization of these devices using inorganic lead halide perovskites are discussed.
2 Properties of material
2.1 Crystal structure
Inorganic halide perovskite crystals are generally expressed by the chemical formula ABX3, where the A-site is a monovalent cation, Cs+, B-site is a bivalent cation, Pb2+, and X-site is a monovalent anion, I−/Br−/Cl−. The X atom is located at the vertex of the octahedral structure, the B atom is situated at the center of the octahedra, and the A atom fills the octahedral space, thus forming the crystal structure of three-dimensional (3D) perovskites by corner-sharing BX6 octahedra. Under different environmental conditions, CsPbX3 perovskites can form four types of crystal structures including cubic phase (α-), tetragonal phase (β-), orthorhombic phase (γ-), and non-perovskite orthorhombic phase (δ-).52 The formation and geometric stability of the crystal structure of an ABX3 compound can be empirically predicted based on t53 and the octahedral factor (μ),54 which helps researchers to pre-screen suitable components to form a stable perovskite lattice. These parameters can be calculated using the following formulas: (1) (2)where RA, RB, and RX are the ionic radii of the corresponding cation and anion, respectively. The perovskite cubic crystal structure can be formed for 0.81 < t < 1.11 and 0.44 < μ < 0.90.55,56Fig. 2a summarizes the calculated t and μ for the ABX3 halide perovskites. A t value close to 0.8 usually leads to distortion of the perovskite structure.57 Taking CsPbI3 as an example, Cs+ (1.81 Å) is too small to maintain the [PbI6]4− octahedral structure, resulting in the distortion of the CsPbI3 perovskite (t = 0.847). Consequently, the CsPbI3 perovskite is prone to structural transformation at RT.58 The partial replacement of I− by Br− can reduce the size of the Cs–X coordination polyhedron,59 and thus Cs+ can retain the [PbX6]4− octahedra structure, and then adjust the values of t and μ to a more desirable range. The t = 0.855 of CsPbI2Br is slightly higher than that of CsPbI3,58 indeed showing improved phase stability at RT.25 Unlike CsPbI3, the CsPbI2Br α-phase is stable at RT.60,61 The theoretical calculation demonstrates that CsPbI2Br has a stable alloying phase due to the strong Coulomb interactions, which is conducive to the inhibition of phase segregation.62,63

Although CsPbI2Br exhibits enhanced phase stability compared to that of neat CsPbI3, it still undergoes a phase transition to the non-perovskite phase upon exposure to high humidity.44,64–67 In the case of CsPbX3 perovskites, the mechanism of water-induced phase transition is substantially different from the hydration/dehydration process of hybrid MAPbI3. The moisture adsorbed on the surface of the CsPbI2Br film can effectively catalyze the perovskite to non-perovskite phase transition at RT by introducing vacancies in the crystal lattice and reducing the free-energy barrier for nucleation.68 Alternatively, a water molecule can be complexed with the MAPbI3 perovskite to form a hydrating product before its decomposition.69–71 The phase instability will damage the operational stability of the PV device. Thus, some works have proposed a series of strategies to resolve the stability issues, including component adjustment, dimensional regulation, and additive technique.
2.2 Optoelectronic properties
The excellent photoelectric properties of perovskite semiconductors depend on the nature of their electronic structures. In the case of the typical CsPbX3 perovskites, their valence band maximum (VBM) is mainly composed of a mixture of Pb 6s orbital and X np orbital, where the X np contribution is dominant (Fig. 2b).72 The conduction band minimum (CBM) results from the anti-bonding mixing of the Pb 6p orbitals and the X np orbitals, where the major contribution is from Pb 6p (Fig. 2b).72 It is well known that the high performance of PSCs is closely related to their high light absorption coefficient, direct bandgap transition, etc. Given that direct bandgap perovskite materials with p → p transition can obtain higher absorption coefficients, elements with lone pair electrons can promote the p properties on the CB. Therefore, if Pb2+, Ge2+, and Sn2+ metal cations are included in CsPbX3 perovskite semiconductors with direct optical bandgaps, they will exhibit high absorption coefficients.
The continuous variation in halide composition from Cl to Br to I results in systematic changes in the optical bandgap.73 It is worth noting that the Urbach parameter, which is a measure of the sub-bandgap tail absorption and related to the static disorder in semiconductors, is unusually low for halide perovskites. More importantly, the absorption coefficient (α) of halide perovskites is very high and their absorption onset is quite sharp, which means that only very thin films (∼500 nm, α ≈ 1.0 × 105 cm−1) can absorb all photons above their bandgap. CsPbI2Br has a bandgap in the range of 1.8–1.9 eV depending on its deposition method39,46,74 and possesses a trade-off between phase stability and light absorption, exhibiting great potential in tandem and semitransparent PV applications. According to the electronic structure of perovskite materials, the VB and the CB are contributed by their lead and halogen components, respectively. The A-site cation in the ABX3 perovskite does not directly involve the electronic band structure of the perovskite semiconductor, but it has the geometric spacer of the [PbI6]4− octahedra in 3D perovskite to prevent tilting. Given that the B-site and X-site elements directly contribute to the electronic band structure of perovskite semiconductors, component engineering of the B- and X- sites can greatly alter the photoelectric properties of perovskite materials.
Both the recombination dynamics and transport properties in individual CsPbI2Br microcrystals can be characterized using ultrafast pump-probe microscopy as a high spatial resolution technique, which provides a direct probe of the spatial and temporal relaxation dynamics.75 Results show that the excited-state dynamics of the CsPbI2Br perovskite primarily decay by first-order (trap-assisted) and Auger recombination, which is different from that of the MAPbI3 perovskite, where bimolecular recombination occurs at a higher excitation density.76 The distribution of the diffusion constants (Dc) of the CsPbI2Br perovskite is in the range of 0.13–0.39 cm2 s−1 (5 and 15 cm2 (V s)−1), which is related to the more commonly referenced ambipolar charge carrier mobility through the Einstein relation. Given that the recombination process is mainly carried out in a trap-assisted way, the ambipolar mobility of CsPbI2Br is significantly lower than that of MAPbI3, ranging between 0.74 and 1.77 cm2 s−1 (28 and 68 cm2 (V s)−1).77 Therefore, to improve the carrier mobility of the light-absorption layer and obtain higher-performance IPSCs, it is crucial to passivate the defects in the CsPbI2Br perovskite.
In addition, the basic properties of CsPbX3 (X = Br, I, or an alloy of both) perovskites were systematically studied using magneto-transmission spectroscopy and several key electronic parameters such as the exciton binding energy (R*) and reduced mass (μ) were accurately determined.78 In the case of CsPbX3 perovskite compounds, the R* and μ values increase with an increase in the bandgap energy, which is similar to hybrid perovskites. The R* and μ of CsPbI2Br (cubic phase) are 22 ± 3 meV and 0.124 ± 0.02m0, respectively (Fig. 2c). The excitons in cubic phase CsPbI2Br can dissociate into free carriers at RT. Knowing the values of R* and μ, the effective dielectric constant εeff of CsPbI2Br can be calculated, which is 8.6. For a given lead halide cage, its dielectric constant does not change significantly, regardless of the cation, whereas it decreases as the halide mass decreases.
3 Deposition methods
3.1 Vacuum deposition
Vacuum deposition has been demonstrated as an effective way to achieve high-quality perovskite films, which offers several advantages such as high uniformity, high reproducibility, and mature industrial fabrication facilities. More importantly, the deposition process does not involve the use of solvents and is suitable for poor-soluble bromide precursor deposition. Thus, this method has also been explored for the crystal growth of CsPbI2Br films. Chen et al. revealed the importance of the precursor stoichiometric molar ratio in the performance of CsPbI2Br IPSCs.42 They applied a co-deposition technique to fabricate stoichiometrically balanced CsPbI2Br films. Excitingly, the all-vacuum-deposited CsPbI2Br-based IPSCs delivered a remarkable PCE of 11.8% with a high Voc of 1.13 V and negligible J–V hysteresis. A further study intensively investigated the effect of the varying the stoichiometry of CsPbI2Br on the film quality and air stability in the dual-source thermal evaporation process.79 They found that the stability of the CsPbI2Br film strongly depended on the deposition ratio of the precursors, where the CsBr-rich CsPbI2Br showed greater stability to air exposure owing to its smaller grain size, leading to crystal lattice strain and preventing degradation.
Later, a CsPbI2Br film was prepared through dual-source thermal evaporation of CsBr and PbI2 (Fig. 3a).80 It was proven that this vacuum deposition method can produce uniform and compact CsPbI2Br perovskite layers on the entire substrate area, resulting in a champion PCE of 5.7% together with high thermal stability for planar IPSCs with an n–i–p structure. In another study, the novel growth of a CsPbX3 perovskite thin film was investigated.81 CsPbI2Br films were fabricated layer-by-layer by precisely controlling the thickness of each layer in an alternative vacuum deposition process, as shown in Fig. 3b. Perovskite crystals can be epitaxially grown by slow and iterative layers of cesium or organic cations and [PbX6]4−, where strict epitaxy involves the application of an ultrahigh vacuum and provides an extremely low growth rate. A 660-pair CsPbI2Br thin film showed a smooth surface and high crystallinity, leading to an outstanding PCE of 13.0% for all-vacuum IPSCs. Recently, a room-temperature vacuum deposition process was developed based on multiple sources and mixed-halide precursors for the fabrication of CsPbI2Br films, as illustrated in Fig. 3c.82 The quality of CsPbI2Br films can be improved by using mixed-halide precursors and increasing the deposition sources, which highlights the importance of promoting halide alloying in the vacuum processing of CsPbI2Br perovskite. It is also found that the structural and optical properties of CsPbI2Br films can be further enhanced by slowing the sublimation of the precursors. Overall, IPSCs showed promising PCEs of 8.3% and 10.0% for CsPbI2Br without or with annealing treatment at 150 °C, respectively.

3.2 Solution-processing deposition
For the fabrication of CsPbI2Br perovskite films, solution deposition is the dominant method due to its low cost, simplicity, and suitability for large-scale manufacture. Generally, there are two solution-processing categories including one-step and two-step sequential deposition methods. In the typical one-step deposition, the CsPbI2Br films are directly deposited from a precursor solution containing an appropriate stoichiometric amount of precursors, followed by annealing treatment to obtain the CsPbI2Br crystal. Snaith's group first obtained high-quality CsPbI2Br films via the one-step spin-coating method.25 The thickness of the CsPbI2Br film was only 150 nm due to the limited solubility of CsPbI2Br in N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) solvent (0.4 M).
Through the optimization of the solvent and annealing conditions, the crystallization of CsPbI2Br perovskite can be controlled via a one-step deposition method. Combined with anti-solvent-extraction technology, Zhang et al. optimized a DMF/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) mixture solvent (volume ratio 3:2) to prepare homogenous and pinhole-free CsPbI2Br films with improved crystallinity. The inverted planar IPSCs with a 410 nm-thickness CsPbI2Br film showed a PCE of 9.14%.83 Another study also optimized the solvent composition (DMF:DMSO volume ratio) (Fig. 4a) to modulate the CsPbI2Br film crystallization growth kinetics, thus enhancing the mass transport and diffusion during film growth, which is the direction parallel to the substrate as the film grows, as shown by the mechanism presented in Fig. 4c.84 Uniform and pinhole-free α-CsPbI2Br films were fabricated by optimizing the solvent engineering and spin-coating process. Consequently, the IPSCs achieved a stable PCE of 14.31% with excellent long-term stability (Fig. 4b).

The annealing condition of the CsPbI2Br film is very important for the formation of black polymorph, which is critical to both the efficiency and phase stability. To better describe the morphology evolution, as-deposited films were annealed for a short time (2 min) at temperatures ranging from 100 °C to 350 °C. The crystal formation of CsPbI2Br is characterized by the preferential growth of large grains, which is known as the Ostwald ripening process. The IPSCs delivered a PCE of 10.7% with a high Voc of 1.23 V by carefully optimizing the annealing temperature of the CsPbI2Br films.85 Subsequently, using a one-step solution process and flash annealing treatment, Gao et al. fabricated black-phase CsPbI2Br films with good denseness, uniformity, and high crystallization.86 The interfacial band alignment between SnO2 and CsPbI2Br is very good, which facilitates the efficient extraction of electrons from CsPbI2Br to SnO2. Consequently, IPSCs with a PCE of up to 13.09% could be achieved. Another example precisely controlled the growth of the CsPbI2Br crystals via a gradient thermal annealing (GTA) and anti-solvent (ATS) treatment method, as depicted in Fig. 4d, where the initial GTA process can slow down the evaporation rate of the residual DMSO, effectively inhibit nucleation aggregation, and promote the formation of high-purity α-CsPbI2Br phase.43 By selecting the suitable anti-solvent IPA with low boiling point and viscosity because it can extract the residual DMSO and has weak coordination interaction with CsPbI2Br precursor, the ATS process can evenly “freeze” the perovskite precursor on the substrate, reduce the solvent edge effect and improve the morphology of the CsPbI2Br film. Consequently, a high-quality CsPbI2Br film with reduced defect density was obtained, leading to a high PCE of 16.07% for IPSCs with the n–i–p structure.
In the case of the two-step deposition method, usually, the PbX2 (X = I and Br) precursor is first deposited on the substrate, followed by coating or dipping of CsX on the as-prepared PbX2 films for the reaction between the two films to form the CsPbI2Br perovskite through annealing treatment. The anti-solvent-assisted multi-step deposition was utilized to prepare a high-quality CsPbI2Br film, as illustrated in Fig. 4e.87 To ensure the complete and effective conversion of PbI2 into CsPbI2Br perovskite, firstly, the as-deposited PbI2 layer was treated with anti-solvent to form a PbI2 (DMSO) intermediate-phase film with nano-sized voids, whose porous structure was conducive to the diffusion of CsBr molecules. Then, the pre-formed PbI2 (DMSO) layer was coated with CsBr methanol solution in multiple steps, and thermal annealing was performed to obtain a fully crystalline CsPbI2Br perovskite. It was found that introducing different anti-solvent treatment processes and turning the number of spin-coating cycles of CsBr could effectively control the grain sizes, crystallinity, and phase purity of the CsPbI2Br film. The prepared CsPbI2Br film showed a highly pure phase, large grain sizes, and full coverage, thus resulting in a champion efficiency of 10.21% for carbon-based IPSCs, together with promising long-term stability. High-quality CsPbI2Br perovskite films were prepared through two-step sequential deposition with the assistance of methylammonium acetate (MAAc) and ethylene glycol (EG) additives.88 It was revealed that the addition of MAAc to the CsX precursor can improve the crystallization of the CsPbI2Br film by facilitating the formation of the MA2Pb3X8 intermediate phase, as illustrated by the mechanism presented in Fig. 4f. Alternatively, the polar EG in the CsX precursor can further increase the uniformity of the film by delaying the precipitation of CsX. Consequently, the carbon-based IPSCs showed a champion PCE of 11.2% with high humidity tolerance.
3.3 Low-temperature preparation
The CsPbI2Br perovskite is generally obtained through thermal annealing at high temperature (around 300 °C), which may cause difficulties in crystal formation and restrict its application in large-scale or flexible devices. Thus, to reduce the processing temperature of CsPbI2Br perovskite films, several approaches have been developed.89 For instance, a low-temperature method was developed to fabricate high-quality CsPbI2Br perovskite.90 I-excess precursors of HPbI3+x (x = 0.1–0.2) were synthesized to replace the PbI2 and used to form a CsPbI2Br film through a one-step method with low-temperature annealing process at 100–130 °C, in which the crystallization energy barrier of the α-CsPbI2Br phase is reduced by the deposition of the precursors (2CsI + PbBr2 + HPbI3+x). The resulting CsPbI2Br films demonstrated phase stability at RT for one month and thermal stability at 100 °C for more than one week. Later, 4-Aminobenzoic acid (ABA) was employed as a nonvolatile additive and high-quality α-phase CsPbI2Br perovskite was achieved after annealing at 100 °C.91 It was found that the ABA additive can effectively retard the fast reaction between the perovskite precursors and help fabricate highly crystalline CsPbI2Br film with interconnected grains. Moreover, the anchored ABA can protect the CsPbI2Br film from moisture attack, thus enhancing the air stability of the film (Fig. 5a). Finally, fully printable IPSCs exhibited a PCE of 8.44% and excellent stability.

Besides, CsPbI2Br films were deposited at RT by DMSO coordination, as shown by the mechanism presented in Fig. 5c and d.92 It was proven that the perovskite crystallization dynamics was controlled through RT solvent (DMSO) annealing (RTSA) treatment (Fig. 5b), which induced the formation of uniform and pinhole-free CsPbI2Br films. After further thermal annealing at 120 °C, the positive effect on perovskite grain growth and the negative effect on the film surface roughness enhancement were balanced, resulting in a PCE of 10.4%. Importantly, low-temperature processing technology allowed the fabrication of flexible IPSCs with a maximum PCE of 7.3% and high bending stability. A further study proposed an approach for depositing high-quality CsPbI2Br films at low temperatures by using a Lewis base DMSO-adduct.93 Under low-temperature conditions, the treatment of lead halides with DMSO could produce the PbI2 (DMSO) and PbBr2 (DMSO) adducts, which effectively prevented the rapid reaction of the precursors and slowed down the crystal growth. The synthesized DMSO adducts allowed a low-activation-energy route to form CsPbI2Br perovskite films, as illustrated in Fig. 5e, resulting in the annealing temperature being reduced to 120 °C (Fig. 5f). Finally, the fabricated CsPbI2Br IPSCs showed PCEs of 13.54% (Fig. 5g) and 11.73% on rigid and flexible substrates, respectively. Then, by using the blade-coating deposition method (Fig. 6a), the same group further utilized the DMSO adducts for fabricating large-area CsPbI2Br IPSCs.94 It was revealed that the negative influence from moisture and the Bénard-Marangoni convection (Fig. 6c) can be effectively counterbalanced by leveraging the blade-coating temperature, yielding uniform and pinhole-free CsPbI2Br films after sequential thermal annealing at 150 °C. Consequently, the IPSCs with an area of 1.0 cm2 gave a PCE of 12.5%, as shown in Fig. 6b.

Similarly, 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) was chosen as the precursor solvent and combined with the vacuum-assisted method to prepare CsPbI2Br films under RT conditions in the air.95 The NMP solvent was rapidly extracted from the precursor film and the CsPbI2Br film could be formed with a low crystallization rate. Finally, the perovskite films showed improved humidity stability compared with the films annealed at high temperatures, and this low-temperature processing enabled the fabrication of rigid and flexible CsPbI2Br IPSCs with efficiencies of up to 8.67% and 6.50%, respectively. A hot-substrate (maintained at 55 °C) deposition method was employed to fabricate large-grain and pinhole-free CsPbI2Br films at a post-annealing temperature of 120 °C, which outperformed the conventional RT-casting and high-temperature processed CsPbI2Br films containing large voids.96 Finally, the IPSCs based on CsPbI2Br films prepared using this hot-casting and low-temperature processing showed a PCE of 12.5%. Recently, a pre-annealing process was developed for the low-temperature (160 °C) fabrication of CsPbI2Br films, shown in Fig. 6d,97 which allows the perovskite film nucleation and crystallization kinetics to be fine-tuned. To improve the energy level mismatch between CsPbI2Br and P3HT and reduce the carrier recombination at the CsPbI2Br/P3HT interface, a diphenylamine derivative was introduced as a buffer layer. By optimizing the pre-annealing temperature, high-quality and enhanced carrier lifetime CsPbI2Br films could be obtained, leading to a high PCE of 15.5% for the dopant-free P3HT-based CsPbI2Br IPSCs, as depicted in Fig. 6e and f.

4.1 Solvent engineering
The precursor solvents are important for the crystallization process of CsPbX3 perovskites, and therefore the final film quality. As previously stated, due to the limited solubility of the CsPbI2Br precursor, the commonly used pure DMF does not dissolve it well, usually resulting in poor film quality.25 It has been proven that the solvent composition plays a key role in the growth of CsPbI2Br crystals, and thus DMF/DMSO solvent-engineering techniques have been developed to fabricate pinhole-free and thickness-controlled CsPbI2Br films in the past few years, especially for the low-temperature processing fabrication.25,83,84,93,98 The solubility of the precursors and the vapor pressure are significant factors affecting the nucleation and crystal growth of perovskites. Due to the strong coordination between DMSO and the perovskite components, the solubility of the CsPbI2Br precursor in DMSO solvent can greatly increased to 2.0 M, where this high concentration of CsPbI2Br precursor is conducive to fabricate thicker CsPbI2Br films with a stronger light absorption capacity.92 The DMF solvent with a boiling point of ∼153 °C and vapor pressure of ∼418 Pa at 25 °C was mixed with DMSO (∼189 °C and ∼126 Pa at 25 °C) to form a mixed solvent.99 The vapor pressure decreased with an increase in the proportion of DMSO. Therefore, the vapor pressure-dependent solvent evaporation rate can be effectively controlled by adjusting the ratio of DMSO:DMF mixed solvent, which is closely related to the nucleation and crystal growth of the perovskite. DMSO can induce the crystallization of the CsPbI2Br perovskite and its possible evolution mechanism is as follows: initially, PbBr2 or PbI2 spontaneously forms layered octahedral [PbI6]4−.92 Due to the strong interaction between DMSO and PbX2, DMSO enters the interlayer.100 Then, CsI species enter the PbX2 interlayer and form the CsI–PbX2–DMSO intermediate phase. Finally, DMSO is gradually removed due to the stronger interaction between PbX2 and CsI.101 Considering the above-mentioned advantages and high-efficiency CsPbI2Br IPSCs obtained thus far, the solvent used in the CsPbI2Br precursor is usually pure DMSO or DMSO dominated.
Nowadays, a low-toxic solvent has been developed to replace the toxic DMF and DMSO for the fabrication of efficient CsPbI2Br IPSCs. For example, the highly volatile and low-toxic acetone solvent was used to assist the growth of perovskite. Also, it was revealed that the strength of the lead-Lewis base interactions and the wettability of the perovskite precursor are both improved (Fig. 7a), leading to the direct crystallization of the desired high-quality α-phase CsPbI2Br at a low-temperature of 40 °C.102 Consequently, IPSCs gave a striking PCE of 16.03% and remarkable long-term operational stability. By utilizing the ionic liquid MAAc as the solvent instead of DMF and DMSO, Wang et al. proposed an interaction-tailoring strategy for the preparation of CsPbI2Br perovskite films.103 It was observed that MAAc had a strong Pb–O interaction with PbI2 and formed N–H⋯I hydrogen bonds, thereby providing a stable precursor solution and allowing the fabrication of high-quality CsPbI2Br films by retarding the crystallization. As a result of this efficient interaction, an air-processing method that does not require anti-solvent treatment and is not affected by humidity was successfully developed and resulted in the formation of pinhole-free, large-grain size, and flat perovskite films.

(b–d) Reproduced with permission.104 Copyright 2018, Elsevier. 
Besides the composition of the solvent, the precursor solution temperature also influences the perovskite film quality. For instance, Liu's group studied the correlation between crystallization and precursor solution temperature for CsPbI2Br perovskite, as illustrated by the mechanism in Fig. 7b and c.104 The temperature of the precursor solution has a great influence on the crystallization process, as follows: (1) the nucleation step is closely related to the solubility of the precursor in a specific solvent or high-temperature solvent. (2) The crystallization growth rate is closely related to the solvent evaporation rate. It has been proven that the improved crystallization of CsPbI2Br films can be realized using a moderate precursor solution temperature. By carefully controlling the precursor solution temperature at 100 °C, a high-quality thick CsPbI2Br film with pinhole-free, the large crystalline grain size was obtained. Consequently, IPSCs with a stabilized PCE of 14.81% (Fig. 7d) were achieved due to the reduction in grain boundaries (GBs).
4.2 Anti-solvent engineering
In the process of fabricating CsPbI2Br films via the solution method, the commonly applied solvents with high boiling points can generate a slow evaporation rate during the coating process, which delays the crystallization process of the perovskite film and makes it difficult to realize a uniform CsPbI2Br film with pinhole-free quality. Therefore, the use of anti-solvents with relatively low boiling points has been proposed to promote the crystallinity of the CsPbI2Br perovskite. Chlorobenzene (CB) has been used as an anti-solvent to improve the crystallization of CsPbI2Br perovskite films; however, its toxicity limits its future applications.63
In recent years, researchers have tried to develop green anti-solvent engineering for the fabrication of high-quality CsPbI2Br films. For example, the green solvent ethyl acetate (EA) was adopted to deposit high-quality CsPbI2Br perovskite.105 Compared with the commonly used toxic anti-solvent CB (boiling point: 132 °C), it was found that the EA (boiling point: 77 °C)-treated CsPbI2Br film showed improved surface morphology and crystallinity with larger grain sizes. Accordingly, the IPSCs with carbon electrodes based on EA anti-solvent engineering exhibited a PCE of 10.0% and remarkable long-term stability. Later, it was shown that methyl acetate (MeOAc) anti-solvent treatment can promote the nucleation and crystallization process of the perovskite, generating high-quality CsPbI2Br films.106 In addition, SnO2 nanoparticle/TiO2 nanocrystal (NC)-structured double ETLs were developed to eliminate the interfacial energy barriers, thereby enhancing the charge transfer and reducing the charge recombination at the CsPbI2Br/ETL interface. Subsequently, together with interfacial engineering, CsPbI2Br films with ordered and humongous grain size, as well as ideal energy level alignment were realized (Fig. 8a). Consequently, the IPSCs showed a high PCE of 15.86%, together with an enhanced Voc of 1.23 V and high FF of 82.29%.

In another study, a suitable amount of liquid water could initiate a synergistic crystallization process of CsPbI2Br perovskite.107 Consequently, uniform and [100] oriented CsPbI2Br films with a large grain size were obtained through the H2O/IPA anti-solvent assisted method, during which the DMSO molecules were desorbed and extracted from the intermediates, as illustrated by the mechanism in Fig. 8b. Recently, to address the issues that limit the efficiency and stability of CsPbI2Br IPSCs, a one-source strategy was explored by using the same polymer donor material (PDM) PBDB-T as a dopant in CsPbI2Br and the HTL, as depicted in Fig. 8d.108 The PDM was dissolved in an anti-solvent and diffused into the pre-deposited CsPbI2Br film, where PDM not only acted as a soft template for the growth of high-quality CsPbI2Br crystals and caused the reduction of the CsPbI2Br Fermi level, but also optimized the energy band alignment in the device (Fig. 8c). In addition, because CsPbI2Br had an ultrathin fibrous PDM film on its surface, using the same PDM as the HTL could strengthen the electrical contact with CsPbI2Br. Meanwhile, during the formation of the HTL, the underlying fibrous PDM film induced self-assembly into a highly ordered fingerprint-like HTL, which significantly improved the conductivity of the HTL in the absence of dopants. Thus, by using the same PBDB-T as the HTL to reduce the energy barrier and improve the hole extraction, the resulting IPSCs achieved a high PCE of 16.40% with high thermal stability.
4.3 Additive engineering
Besides solvent and anti-solvent engineering, introducing additives in the precursor is another effective way to control the crystallization of the perovskite and improve the CsPbI2Br film quality as well as its humidity stability. Organic functional molecules are widely used additives in CsPbI2Br IPSCs. For example, methylamine (MA) gas was employed to realize a high-quality CsPbI2Br film by incorporating the MAX (X = I or Br) additive in the precursor solution. It was found that the MAX additive greatly improved the interconnection between the perovskite film and the MA gas, and the MA gas healing process allowed the formation of uniform pinhole-free CsPbI2Br perovskite layers, as depicted by the mechanism presented in Fig. 9a.109 Using this method, the PCE of the corresponding IPSC was enhanced to 13.1% with the Voc boosted from 1.11 V to 1.28 V. The addition of methylammonium iodide (MAI) can retard the crystallization kinetics by cation exchange, where an MA+ ion is replaced by a Cs+ ion.110 The controlled crystal growth of α-CsPbI2Br films produced an enlarged grain size, improved crystallinity, and reduced defect density. In addition, ethylammonium bromide (EABr) additive can also retard the crystal growth of CsPbI2Br films to obtain a highly crystalline perovskite films with reduced GBs and micro-size grains (>1 μm).111 Consequently, the devices based on an optimum amount of EABr (4 mg mL−1) showed a PCE of 14.47%.

Later, steric hindrance additives were introduced to obtain the high-quality crystallization of CsPbI2Br films.112 Because the larger steric hindrance additive can affect the crystallization of the CsPbI2Br perovskite, a dense and nonporous polycrystalline film can be formed with the help of a new intermediate monoclinic phase, which is caused by the steric hindrance effect of cesium cyclohexanecarboxylate (C6) (Fig. 9c). Moreover, the stability of the CsPbI2Br film was also improved by the residues of steric hindrance molecules. Correspondingly, stable IPSCs with a PCE of 15.45% and Voc of over 1.26 V were achieved (Fig. 9b). Recently, TMACl was selected as an additive due to its hydrophobicity and balanced solubility in the precursor.113 Consequently, it was demonstrated that high-crystallinity α-CsPbI2Br with a pinhole-free film morphology and improved phase stability without adversely affected electronic structure or lattice parameter can be obtained, leading to a high PCE of 14.12% for the CsPbI2Br IPSCs. More importantly, the IPSCs showed excellent ambient stability owing to the increased hydrophobic properties of the CsPbI2Br films induced by the TMACl additive.
In addition to the improvement of the film quality, additive engineering is also considered a useful strategy to passivate the defects at GBs and suppress the charge recombination, thus improving the PV performance and stability of the CsPbI2Br IPSCs. To overcome the undesirable phase transformation of the CsPbI2Br perovskite, α-phase CsPbI2Br was stabilized in the air by using Pb(II) propionate as an additive in the CsPbI2Br precursor, which can passivate the perovskite film and enhance its environmental stability.49 This is most likely due the fact that propionate ions, which have strong chemical interactions with Pb2+ in solution, maintain coordination with the uncoordinated Pb2+ on the surface or at the GBs, thus reducing the amount of defects. With the use of a novel polymer HTL with higher hole mobility to optimize the energy level alignment, the IPSCs (Fig. 9d) fabricated in the air showed an efficiency of 14.58%. Another work introduced the nonionic polyethyleneimine (PEI) as an additive to stabilize the phase structure and passivate the defects in the CsPbI2Br perovskite.114 PEI with amino groups can form a hydrogen bond with I/Br ions and coordinate with Pb/Cs ions (Fig. 9e), which dramatically reduced the defects and regulated the grain size of the CsPbI2Br film, thus boosting the PCE of the corresponding IPSCs to 15.48%. Additionally, the hydrophobic alkyl chain of the PEI additive can cover GBs of the CsPbI2Br film, which improves the humidity resistance of the devices.
A Lewis base molecule of NMP was introduced to suppress the non-radiative recombination and reduce the defects on the surface or GBs of a CsPbI2Br film.115 It was found that the NMP additive induced a strong interaction between the Pb-O bond and CsPbI2Br perovskite, shown in Fig. 9f, thus enhancing the crystallization and greatly reducing the non-radiative recombination paths via defect passivation. Consequently, the optimized IPSCs acquired a PCE of 16.77% with a high FF. Using the same idea, Li et al. proposed a passivation strategy by introducing the dual-functionalized bidentate molecule 2-(2′-thienyl)pyridine (2-ThPy) to regulate CsPbI2Br crystallization and passivate halogen vacancy defects.116 It was suggested that 2-ThPy can anchor Pb ions, simultaneously enlarging the grain size of the film and effectively reducing the trap state density, thereby suppressing the unfavorable non-radiative recombination. Consequently, the IPSCs exhibited a promising PCE of 12.69% with negligible hysteresis. Moreover, the devices also showed enhanced humidity stability due to the strong coordination between the CsPbI2Br films and 2-ThPy bidentate molecules.
The Lewis base polymer polyethylene glycol (PEG) also can be utilized as an additive to regulate the crystallization process and efficiently passivate the defects of the CsPbI2Br perovskite.117,118 For instance, Zhang et al. proved that with PEG modification to slow down the crystallization rate, the homogenous and dense CsPbI2Br film showed suppressed interface energy losses and suitable energy-level alignment, leading to an improved PCE of 13.59%.117 In another example, a novel multifunctional liquid additive 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) was introduced to modify the CsPbI2Br precursor (Fig. 9g) and fabricate efficient and stable CsPbI2Br IPSCs.119 It was indicated that the functional groups of HEMA can engage with the perovskite precursor, improving the crystallization and passivating defects, boosting the PCE of the IPSCs to 16.1%. More importantly, HEMA molecules in perovskite films can polymerize into a hydrophobic polymer at the GBs by breaking the CC bonds during the high-temperature annealing process (160 °C), which enhances the moisture tolerance of the CsPbI2Br films and devices by crosslinking the perovskite grains and blocking moisture penetration. Besides organic molecules, the use of the inorganic polysulfide S8 as an additive not only can slow down the crystallization of the α-CsPbI2Br perovskite but also effectively passivate the GBs via distinctive Pb–S coordination interaction.120 Additionally, the majority of cyclic S8 additives are located near the surface of the CsPbI2Br film, leading to improved surface hydrophobicity.
5 Composition engineering
Composition engineering is a critical factor in determining the performance of IPSCs, including A-, B-, and X-site alloying/doping. Hence, the choice of species at the A-, B-, and X-site affects the crystal growth, and thereby influences the associated performance of IPSCs. Table 2 summarizes the A/B-site alloying/doping engineering of CsPbI2Br films and PV performance of the corresponding IPSCs.

5.1 A-site doping
Alkali metal cations have been intensively explored for their incorporation in the A-site of the inorganic perovskite lattice. Regarding the strategy of A-site doping in the CsPbI2Br perovskite with alkali metal ions, the alkali metal doping at the A-site can facilitate a reduction in defect state density and increase in grain size, thus enhancing the quality of the CsPbI2Br perovskite film. Nam's group was the first to report the A-site doping of potassium (K) cations in the CsPbI2Br perovskite to form Cs1−xKxPbI2Br, which facilitates photoexcited charge carrier formation and transportation.44 Based on the Cs0.925K0.075PbI2Br perovskite film, the planar-architecture device achieved a PCE of 10.0% and extended operational lifetime against air. The structural analyses confirmed that the incorporation of K+ cations led to the contraction of the PbX6 octahedral volume (Fig. 10a), thereby improving the phase stability. Similarly, rubidium (Rb) cations were selected for doping the CsPbI2Br perovskite, which led to improved phase stability and reduced defect density.131–133 Consequently, the Cs0.99Rb0.01PbI2Br perovskite films showed high crystallinity, extremely dense, uniform grains, and pinhole-free morphology, and the device with poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) as the HTL produced the highest PCE of 17.16% and excellent thermal stability, as shown in Fig. 10b.133 Recently, the incorporation of sodium (Na) cations at the A-site of CsPbI2Br enhanced the I− diffusion barrier energy from 0.229 eV to 0.401 eV, suggesting the suppression of iodide vacancies.134 The assembled HTM-free, carbon-based all-inorganic CsPbI2Br PSCs presented a champion PCE of 14.63%, which is the best performance for carbon-based IPSCs. The improvement in PV performance is attributed to the synergistic passivation of the alkali metal in suppressing the non-radiative recombination.

5.2 B-site doping
Besides A-site doping, doping a metal ion in the B-site is also a useful means to modify the optoelectronic and stability properties of the CsPbI2Br perovskite due to its effective influence on passivating defects and crystal growth. To date, homovalent metal ions such as Ge2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+, Fe2+, and Yb2+ and heterovalent cations such as In3+, Eu3+, La3+, Sm3+, Y3+, and Nb5+ have been employed to dope the B-site of CsPbI2Br perovskites. For example, Yang's group for the first time reported the preparation of all-inorganic CsPb1−xGexI2Br (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) perovskites by replacing Pb2+ with different amounts of Ge2+ cations.137 The CsPbI2Br perovskites with Ge2+ dopant showed a longer charge carrier lifetime and low trap densities. In another study, interstitial Mn2+ ion doping could increase the lattice constant and slow down the crystallization process of the CsPbI2Br film, leading to improved microcrystalline thin films, as depicted by the mechanism in presented Fig. 10d.135 Moreover, the excess Mn2+ ions on the surface and GBs of the CsPbI2Br film provided effective passivation, resulting in reduced recombination loss.
The Pb-site can be easily replaced by Sr2+ due to its smaller ionic radius. Sr2+ has a symmetric electron configuration, which is beneficial for maintaining the very small directional bonding in the octahedron of the perovskite, making it a promising candidate for B-site doping in CsPbI2Br.67,138 The surface morphology of the CsPbI2Br perovskite film was improved by the partial substitution of Pb2+ by Sr2+, which contributed to the stabilization of the photoactive black phase and defect passivation in the GBs.45 Consequently, the optimized Sr2+ concentration in the CsPb0.98Sr0.02I2Br-based IPSCs produced the highest PCE of 16.61% (Fig. 10c), as well as excellent stability under ambient conditions. Recently, a small amount of novel cation Fe2+ was incorporated in the CsPbI2Br perovskite.136 This facile strategy effectively stabilized the black α-CsPbI2Br phase owing to the decrease in grain size induced by Fe2+. FeCl2 doping resulted in the formation of a high-quality CsPbI2Br film with favorable energy levels (Fig. 10e), promoted the built-in potential, and reduced the defect states. Ultimately, a record-high PCE of 17.1% with a remarkable Voc of 1.31 V was achieved based on 0.5% Fe2+-doped CsPbI2Br IPSCs. Besides a small amount of metal doping, the stable and abundant Zn2+ was used to reduce ≥10% Pb2+ in the CsPbI2Br perovskite.139 Due to the different physicochemical properties of Zn2+, the crystal morphology and energy band structure were effectively tuned (Fig. 11a and b), promoting the efficiency to 13.6% in CsPb0.9Zn0.1I2Br IPSCs, which was much higher than the 11.8% of the pure CsPbI2Br solar cell. Another study found that the doping of Ba element does not result in its incorporation in the CsPbI2Br lattice, but segregates into Ba-based non-perovskite phases with concomitant halide segregation, where the introduction of Ba can effectively inhibit the formation of metallic Pb and reduce non-radiative recombination, leading to a substantial increase in Voc.65 The enhanced stability of the CsPb0.8Ba0.2I2Br-based PSCs may be due to the protection of the film surface with the Ba-rich phases or the reduction in defects in the device. By adding 20 mol% Ba2+, the device showed a PCE of 14.0% with a high Voc of 1.33 V.

B-site doping with heterovalent cations has a propensity to alter the concentration and the type of the majority charge carrier of the perovskite, and therefore has a significant influence on the optoelectronic properties of CsPbI2Br films. For example, In3+ and Cl− co-doping allowed the pure and stabilized α-phase of the CsPbI2Br perovskite to be obtained due to the structure reconstruction and the crystal lattice contraction (Fig. 11c–e), thereby enhancing the long-term ambient stability of the perovskite film.140 This is related to the enhanced spatial symmetry and tightly packed atomic arrangement of the α-phase InCl3:CsPbI2Br material. In another study, doping Eu3+ in CsPbI2Br contributed to increasing the t and stability of the CsPbI2Br perovskite. In addition, the Eu3+ ion also could accumulate at the GBs in the as-achieved thin films, thus effectively reducing the non-radiative recombination centers and stabilizing the CsPbI2Br phase with moderate grain size.141 The B-site doping of 5% Eu3+ boosted the PCE of CsPbI2Br IPSCs to 13.71% (Fig. 11f) with excellent stability under continuous light illumination.64 The PCE of the IPSCs based on CsPbI2Br perovskite doped by Eu(Ac)3 could be further improved to 15.25% owing to the high-quality inorganic perovskite film with low defect density and long carrier lifetime.142
Besides, B-site doping with pentavalent cations has also been adopted for the improvement of the properties of the CsPbI2Br perovskite. The incorporation of 0.5% Nb5+ ions well stabilized the phase of the perovskite film and improved its crystal quality, thus greatly enhancing the stability of the CsPbI2Br perovskite.143 Moreover, the excess positive charge derived from Nb5+ doping can be balanced by the Pb2+ vacancies and the excess halide anions at the interstitial sites of the perovskite. Consequently, the charge recombination in the CsPbI2Br carbon-based IPSCs was reduced, resulting in a PCE of 10.42% with negligible hysteresis. Similarly, Nb5+-doped IPSCs were fabricated via the hot air method under ambient conditions and gained a gratifying PCE of 16.45% with a high Voc of 1.31 V based on the CsPb0.995Nb0.005I2Br perovskite film (Fig. 11g).144
6 Interface engineering
6.1 CsPbI2Br/HTL interface engineering
The HTLs in CsPbI2Br IPSCs allow the effective transportation and extraction holes from the active layer to the electrode, and thus have a very close relationship with the device performance and long-term stability. Additionally, an efficient HTL suppresses the recombination loss at the CsPbI2Br/HTL interface.161 Previously, the organic small molecule spiro-OMeTAD was the most widely used HTL in IPSCs, and dopants such as t-BP and Li-TFSI were adopted to increase its mobility. The phase stability of α-CsPbI2Br was studied under different moisture conditions. It was proven that although the Li-salt-doped spiro-MeOTAD HTL offered an enhanced PV performance of up to 12.6%, it exhibited decreased humidity stability, which is ascribed to the hygroscopic property of Li-TFSI inducing the moisture-sensitive phase degradation.162 Thus, some dopant-free small molecular/polymeric HTLs have been designed and employed in CsPbI2Br IPSCs. For example, a new fluorinated 2mF-X59 as the dopant-free HTL was developed in CsPbI2Br IPSCs, as shown in Fig. 12a.163 The device showed improved charge transfer owing to the downshifted HOMO level of the HTL, as illustrated in Fig. 12b, resulting in a PCE of 14.42% with an impressive Voc of 1.23 V. In another study, a D–A–D-type small-molecule, YN3, was synthesized (Fig. 12c) as a dopant-free HTL for CsPbI2Br IPSCs, which exhibited good conductivity and improved hole-extraction/transport ability.164 The obtained devices showed an impressive PCE of 12.05%, outperforming most small organic HTMs reported at that time. Recently, a novel 3D small molecule, TPE-S (Fig. 12d), was synthesized as the HTL for inverted IPSCs.50 The S atoms of TPE-S not only effectively passivated the defects by coordinating the Pb2+ vacancies in CsPbI2Br, but also significantly affected the quality of the perovskite films and decreased the interfacial recombination. The CsPbI2Br IPSCs based on the TPE-S HTL demonstrated a remarkable PCE of 15.4% together with excellent stability, which is attributed to the enhanced optoelectronic properties and reduced charge carrier recombination due to the improved trap passivation effect. Table 3 summarizes the CsPbI2Br/HTL interface engineering and PV performance of the corresponding CsPbI2Br IPSCs.

The conductive conjugated polymer P3HT has been widely exploited as a dopant-free polymeric HTL in CsPbI2Br IPSCs.46,165 The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the P3HT-based CsPbI2Br IPSCs decreased in the range of 450–650 nm because of the strong absorption of P3HT overlapping that of the CsPbI2Br perovskite. Through the simple spin-washing of the P3HT HTL, a further study recovered the EQE lost in the CsPbI2Br mesoscopic IPSCs.166 By minimizing the co-absorption of light by P3HT, the light-harvesting efficiency could be improved. Furthermore, owing to the increased VBM position of the spin-washed P3HT HTL, the Voc was enhanced. Benefiting from this optimization, the CsPbI2Br IPSCs yielded a PCE of 14.35% with exceptional long-term stability. It is also well known that molecular packing and orientation of the P3HT HTL play a critical role in the hole extraction and recombination kinetics. In a recent study, SMe-TATPyr (Fig. 12g) was employed to manipulate the orientation of P3HT and suppress the electrical loss.167 The developed P3HT/SMe-TATPyr HTLs could induce the formation of “face-on” clusters, as depicted in Fig. 12f, resulting in an enhancement in carrier mobility. Also, the HTL exhibited a defect passivation effect, and reduced voltage loss occurred at the CsPbI2Br/HTL interface owing to the favorable energy level alignment, as shown in Fig. 12e.
Another work demonstrated that polymeric PDCBT with deeper-lying HOMO level can provide better energy-level matching, leading to significant enhancement in the Voc of the CsPbI2Br IPSCs.47 Moreover, PDCBT can strongly interact with the CsPbI2Br perovskite crystal, effectively passivating the trap states and suppressing the interfacial recombination, as shown by the mechanism presented in Fig. 13a–c. Consequently, the CsPbI2Br IPSCs with dopant-free PDCBT exhibited an efficiency of over 16% and excellent photostability. The π-conjugated polymer PBDB-T is a typical p-type electron donor material in organic solar cells. In another study, PBDB-T and its derivatives were employed as dopant-free HTLs in CsPbI2Br IPSCs.168 Finally, the device with PBDB-T-Si HTLs exhibited a PCE of 15.60% with a high FF exceeding 84%. The excellent performance is related to the deeper HOMO level, superior hole mobility, and quasi-Ohmic contact of the PBDB-T-Si HTLs, which reduce the hole transport barrier and balance the carrier transport in the devices. Recently, based on previous studies, to further improve the Jsc and FF in CsPbI2Br IPSCs, a new polymer, PDTDT, was developed to replace the D–A polymer (DTSTPDr-BThTPD) (Fig. 13d) as a dopant-free polymeric HTL.169 PDTDT shows a high hole mobility and can passivate the surface defects, which reduces the interface trap density and carrier recombination, thus leading to a high PCE of 17.36% with Voc of 1.42 V for CsPbI2Br IPSCs. More importantly, PDTDT shows superior/comparable device stability to P3HT, making it a promising alternative HTL to spiro-OMeTAD and P3HT (Fig. 13e).

Besides organic HTLs, inorganic materials with intrinsic chemical stability and favorable energy levels are widely employed as HTLs to boost the long-term stability and PCE of CsPbI2Br IPSCs. In early studies, tailored NiO NCs as HTLs were utilized (Fig. 13f) in the solution deposition method for the fabrication of all-layer-inorganic CsPbI2Br PSC with a n–i–p structure, as shown in Fig. 13g, which exhibited robust long-term thermal stability and outstanding PCE of up to 15.14%.170 The high performance of the IPSCs was attributed to the uniform, pinhole-free morphologies and efficient charge-extraction capabilities of the NiO NC HTL deposited by the solution plus simple thermal annealing process. In another study, an NiOx HTL was deposited by electron beam evaporation to improve the film uniformity and reproducibility for the preparation of organic-free p–i–n-type CsPbI2Br IPSCs (Fig. 14a).171 The fabricated devices achieved high PCE of 14.1% and 11.2% on small and large areas of 0.155 cm2 and 5.0 cm2, respectively, due to the effective hole extraction ability of the perovskite/NiOx interface and uniformity of the CsPbI2Br film. Moreover, the organic-free architecture showed excellent thermal stability. Besides the widely used inorganic NiOx, CuSCN was also employed as inorganic HTLs in CsPbI2Br IPSCs. For instance, Mali et al. used hot-air-assisted perovskite deposition for the fabrication of pinhole-free CsPbI2Br perovskite films and obtained the PCE of 15.27% with a high Voc of 1.28 V in IPSCs by using dopant-free CuSCN HTLs, benefitting from the matched energy level between CuSCN and the CsPbI2Br perovskite.148 Importantly, the device maintained long-term thermal stability due to the superior thermal stability of CuSCN. Using Co3O4 as a novel inorganic HTL, planar carbon-based CsPbI2Br IPSCs were developed, as shown in Fig. 14d.172 It was demonstrated that Co3O4 can effectively promote the separation and extraction of photo-generated carriers and suppress the charge recombination at the CsPbI2Br/carbon electrode interface (Fig. 14c), resulting in an improved PCE of 11.21% with negligible J–V hysteresis.

In addition to the single-layer HTL, bilayer cascade HTLs have also been developed to further reduce the electronic surface trap states and adjust the energy levels in CsPbI2Br IPSCs. For example, bilayer NiOx/Zn:CuGaO2 as inorganic HTLs was proposed to construct novel-structured CsPbI2Br IPSCs.173 Benefiting from the well-matched energy alignment between the CTLs/CsPbI2Br (Fig. 14b), which leads to enhanced charge transfer and reduced interfacial recombination, the IPSCs showed a PCE of 15.10% together with good thermal and operational stability. Recently, a bilayer underlayer including dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD and TS-CuPc nanoparticles was designed for the preparation of dopant-free and inverted CsPbI2Br IPSCs (Fig. 14e).174 It was found that the defect density and interfacial tensile strain were remarkably reduced, and IPSCs based on the spiro-OMeTAD/TS-CuPc HTLs exhibited improved PCE of 14.85% and enhanced thermal/humidity stability owing to the better perovskite crystallization, interfacial passivation, and hole-collection.
Strategies to block moisture, passivate defects, and reduce the interface recombination between perovskite and HTL are crucial to realize efficient and stable CsPbI2Br IPSCs. Some steric organic cations can partially replace the Cs+ to form low-dimensional perovskites, among which spacer cations not only can improve the humidity stability of perovskites and prevent ion migration, but also the van der Waals forces between them help to maintain the structural stability and further enhance the stability of PV devices.124,175,176 For example, a 3D–2D–0D multiple-graded interface based on CsPbI2Br bulk, nanosheet, and QDs, respectively, was developed to optimize the valence and conduction bands of both CsPbI2Br and the HTL layer.177 This multigrade interface not only improved the efficiency of hole extraction and transport, effectively reduced the recombination loss during the hole-transport process, and enhanced the built-in electric field, resulting in an increased operating voltage, but also improved the stability of the CsPbI2Br by hydrophobic terminal groups. Finally, the best-performing device showed a PCE of 12.39%. A 2D/3D heterostructure was formed by in situ growth method by introducing a small amount of DMSO in the alkyl-ammonium halide solution, in which a type-II heterojunction was formed between the 2D and 3D perovskites, promoting hole extraction and suppressing the charge carrier recombination at the CsPbI2Br/HTL interface. Consequently, the optimized 2D/3D CsPbI2Br device exhibited a PCE of 14.5% with significantly enhanced stability.178 A low-dimensional intermediate-assisted growth (LDIAG) strategy was developed to fabricate a highly crystalline, pinhole-free, low-defect, and stable CsPbI2Br film under ambient conditions by incorporating imidazole halide (IMX: IMI and IMBr) in the precursor solution to regulate both the nucleation and growth kinetics of the CsPbI2Br perovskite.124 Firstly, IMX could combine with PbI2 in the precursor film to form a 2D intermediate. Then, PbI2 was gradually released during the annealing process, and a high-quality CsPbI2Br film was slowly formed. Consequently, the LDIAG-processed CsPbI2Br IPSCs delivered an excellent PCE of 17.26% and maintained 86% of their initial PCE after 1000 h of storage in the ambient air. In addition, glycine halide (Gly-X: X = Cl, Br, and I) additives were introduced in the CsPbI2Br precursor solution as passivating agents to modulate the crystallization process of the perovskite. Gly-I can slow down the crystallization of CsPbI2Br to improve its quality. Its CO and –OH groups can effectively passivate the defects at the GBs and create a strong interaction with 3D perovskite to prevent the migration of halide ions, thereby enhancing the photostability and phase stability of CsPbI2Br. 2D/3D hybrid perovskites were formed, in which the 2D Gly2PbI4 perovskites were mainly located at the GBs. Finally, the optimized IPSCs with a Gly2PbI4/CsPbI2Br hybrid configuration yielded a PCE of 17.26% with a high Voc of 1.33 V.176
6.2 CsPbI2Br/ETL interface engineering
The ETLs in CsPbI2Br IPSCs play an important role in extracting and transporting the generated photoelectrons to the corresponding electrode. Generally, the ETLs used in CsPbI2Br IPSCs can be divided into organic and inorganic materials. Organic ETLs are usually C60 and its derivatives such as PC61BM. To downshift the LUMO level of C60 and increase the electron mobility, TPFPB and LiClO4 were applied to tailor C60 for the fabrication of CsPbI2Br IPSCs.186 The introduced TPFPB molecule could attract electrons from the C60 molecule, resulting in enhanced electron extraction ability and reduced electron trap density. Moreover, the ClO4− anions of the LiClO4 salt could coordinate with the dissociated TPFPB, which increased the film conductivity by releasing the Li+ ions, leading to a reduction in the device hysteresis. These as-optimized IPSCs with co-doped C60 ETL showed reduced charge recombination and device hysteresis, gaining PCEs of 15.19% and 14.44% for the small-sized and large-area devices, respectively. Table 4 summarizes the CsPbI2Br/ETL interface engineering and PV performance of the corresponding CsPbI2Br IPSCs.

Thus far, the widely employed inorganic ETLs include TiO2, SnO2, ZnO, and ZnMgO. Among them, TiO2 is the most common ETL for IPSCs; however, it shows some intrinsic drawbacks such as low electron mobility (<1 cm2 (V s)−1), high-temperature sintering process, and instability against the atmosphere. The formation of the carbide-titanium oxide c-TiO2 changes the band structure of TiO2, which affects the electron-extraction and hole-blocking properties.187 The modified c-TiO2 was used for the fabrication of inverted CsPbI2Br IPSCs, resulting in a PCE of 14% due to the well-matched band alignment (Fig. 15a) and suitable conductivity. The c-TiO2 ETLs also contributed to the improvement in the long-term stability of the CsPbI2Br IPSCs owing to the unique band structure and chemical stability of the c-TiO2 ETL.187,188 Recently, solution-processed Sn-doped TiO2 (Ti1−xSnxO2) NCs were prepared as the ETL in inverted CsPbI2Br IPSCs, which showed higher conductivity compared to TiO2.189 Moreover, the Sn-doped TiO2 films improved the interface contact in the IPSCs owing to the facile film formation, high electron mobility, and suitable energy level, leading to PCEs of 14% for small-sized devices and 11.2% for 1.0 cm2 devices, respectively. Additionally, the Sn-doped TiO2 NCs showed high light stability and heat resistance, which enhanced the light and thermal stability of the CsPbI2Br IPSCs.

Besides the widely used TiO2, inorganic SnO2 is another alternative ETL developed in CsPbI2Br IPSCs due to its high-lying conduction band and low sintering temperature.190,191 For example, the use of an aged SnCl2 precursor solution was proposed to prepare an SnOx ETL, which led to the formation of a more uniform and smoother amorphous SnOx film having enhanced contact with the CsPbI2Br layer (Fig. 15b).192 Finally, the IPSCs showed an enhanced Voc of up to 1.43 V, which is attributed to the reduced interfacial gaps and trap state density in the device. Furthermore, the corresponding IPSCs exhibited improved long-term stability (Fig. 15c), which is mainly attributed to the lower lattice strain. To improve the interfacial properties of SnO2 ETL-based CsPbI2Br IPSCs, another example used TMACl-passivated SnO2 as the ETL.193 The TMACl not only passivated the oxygen vacancies in the SnO2 ETL and reduced the traps density but also reduced the work function of the SnO2 ETL and facilitated a suitable energy level alignment between the CsPbI2Br and ETL, thus boosting the electron transport at the interface. Through this method, the charge carrier recombination was significantly suppressed, thus resulting in an enhanced PCE of 13.84% and improved long-term stability for the CsPbI2Br IPSCs.
Due to the more matched energy level and higher electron mobility of ZnO194 compared to TiO2 and SnO2, the inorganic ZnO was employed as the ETL in CsPbI2Br IPSCs in recent years. The low-temperature solution-processed ZnO as the ETL was introduced to replace the commonly used SnO2.195 Compared to the SnO2-based CsPbI2Br IPSCs, the ZnO-based devices showed more appropriate band matching, leading to suppressed interfacial recombination and superior electron extraction capability in the devices. In another study, Al-doped ZnO (AZO) as an ETL was developed for the fabrication of high-efficiency flexible CsPbI2Br IPSCs, as illustrated in Fig. 15d.196 The AZO ETL possessed an appropriate energy level alignment (Fig. 15e) and strong electron extraction capability. Combining the tert-butyl cyanoacetate (t-BCA) passivating layer to passivate the CsPbI2Br surface trap states and further improve the charge transport properties (Fig. 15f and g), the resulting flexible CsPbI2Br IPSCs showed a PCE of 15.08% and outstanding stability. Wang et al. used organic ligand-armored ZnO as the ETL in planar CsPbI2Br IPSCs (Fig. 15h) and obtained a high PCE of 16.84% (Fig. 15i) with improved stability, which remarkably outperformed the TiO2- and SnO2-based devices.197 The enhanced performance of the IPSCs is attributed to the excellent crystallinity of the CsPbI2Br film and effective trap passivation induced by the organic ligands. Besides, the energy loss and the interfacial defects of the CsPbI2Br IPSCs can be effectively reduced by the combination of bilayer ETLs with high electron mobility/conductivity, low trap state, and suitable band structure.198,199
7 Summary and outlook
Solar cells with inorganic perovskite as light absorber layers exhibit excellent thermal stability and high theoretical efficiency, showing great commercialization potential in the PV field. CsPbI2Br is a promising member of the inorganic perovskite family, which has a suitable bandgap and can be adopted as the top cell in multi-junction tandem solar cells to realize a higher PV device efficiency. Some representative studies on using various strategies to fabricate high-quality CsPbI2Br films for efficient PV applications have been discussed. To date, the operating stability and efficiency of CsPbI2Br-based IPSCs have been significantly improved by optimizing the deposition process and regulating the interface, etc. Herein, we summarized accomplishments in improving crystal growth, such as solvent engineering, anti-solvent engineering, and additive engineering. The strategic doping of the CsPbI2Br perovskite, such as A- and B-site doping, was introduced. The incorporation of various ions can improve the stability of the CsPbI2Br perovskite lattice, and thereby influence the associated performance of IPSCs. In addition, the interface layer in IPSCs has a great influence on the charge transfer, recombination kinetics, and stability of PV devices. A well-matched bandgap alignment facilitates charge extraction and avoids charge accumulation. Interface engineering has been effectively adopted in mixed halide IPSCs, which helps reduce surface traps and improve phase stability.
As mentioned earlier, in the development of PSCs, the replacement of the volatile organic cations with inorganic cations has emerged as a promising way to improve the intrinsic stability of the perovskite material. However, there is still a long way to go to further boost the long-term stability of IPSCs under the harsh outdoor conditions. To achieve efficient and stable CsPbI2Br IPSCs, some promising suggestions are as follows: (1) phase stability under high humidity conditions is challenging. Hence, the use of additives or hydrophobic interlayers in the bulk and advanced encapsulation techniques are urgently needed. Alloying or elemental doping through the use of larger A-site and smaller B- or X-site atoms is also another means to improve the stability of the CsPbI2Br phase due to the alleviated internal stress and adjusted t. (2) It is necessary to reduce the density of defect states in CsPbI2Br films and the recombination of the perovskite/CTL interface. The development of interface modifier materials and new additives is a possible way to solve this problem, such as intermediate layers with appropriate energy levels that form a cascade between the CsPbI2Br perovskite and CTLs to build well-aligned bands, facilitate charge extraction and minimize the energy loss. There is still a significant difference between the currently used HTLs and CsPbI2Br perovskite with a VBM of −6.08 eV. Therefore, to reduce the interface recombination, it is crucial to develop novel HTMs that can fit well with the VB of the CsPbI2Br layer. (3) The CsPbI2Br perovskite has good thermal stability, and thus the stability of the solar cell under heat mainly depends on the other components of the PV device. A holistic strategy that combines additive engineering, interface engineering, and thermally stable CTLs with high hole/electron mobility and desirable energy bands is beneficial. CsPbI2Br IPSCs with inorganic ETL and HTL are promising for future industrialization, but processes suitable for the deposition of the inorganic transport layer on the perovskite surface need to be developed.
To make the most of the wide energy range of the sunlight spectrum and obtain higher efficiency, tandem solar cells have become an important direction of PV technology development. When the top solar cell bandgap is 1.8–1.9 eV and the bottom solar cell bandgap is 1.1–1.2 eV, the efficiency of a double-junction all-perovskite tandem solar cell can reach more than 31%.206,207 Given that the suitable bandgap of CsPbI2Br is 1.8–1.9 eV (depending on the different fabrication processes), the application prospect and valuable potential of CsPbI2Br as the top cell in tandem PV devices are illustrated. However, tandem solar cells based on a CsPbI2Br top cell are rarely studied. Besides, there is not enough research on large-scale modules and flexible PV applications. The low-temperature preparation of functional layers can simplify the large-scale manufacturing process, be more beneficial to fabricate flexible devices, and then reduce the cost of industrialization. In addition, to increase the light utilization of the photoactive layer, plasmonic and geometric optical trap structures can be properly designed.
