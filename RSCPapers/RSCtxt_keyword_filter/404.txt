This review is focused on the advances in the incorporation of PDIs as photoactive components in different solar cell devices. An impressive number of perylenediimides have been incorporated into p–n organic solar cells, as non-fullerene acceptors in bulk heterojunction solar cells, as photosensitisers in dye-sensitised solar cells, in perovskite solar cells, and also as interlayers acting as either electron- or hole-transporting materials. All of this has led to devices with outstanding photovoltaic performance and these are described in this review.

1. Introduction
Despite their rather simple structure, perylenediimides (PDIs) have caught the attention of many chemists, physicists and materials scientists due to the peerless properties that they display.1 It is not only a question of the stability against chemicals, heat, and radiation, but also the strong absorption of visible light and the outstanding fluorescence. Equally important is their electron affinity and their ability to act as n-type semiconductors. All of these properties can be modified significantly by the introduction of substituents in the different available positions of the aromatic core, namely the bay (positions 1, 6, 7 and 12) and ortho (positions 2, 5, 8 and 11) positions shown in Fig. 1.2 Thus, selective substitution of the PDI core allows the tuning of the absorption profile, and hence the colour. For example, the absorption maximum can be modified from 550 nm in the unsubstituted PDI to 710 nm in the triamino-substituted PDIs.3 The electron-accepting character of the PDIs can also be altered to electron-donating again using amino groups.3 Moreover, the substituents on the PDI play an important role in the molecular organization and hence the morphology of the material in the solid state, which is crucial for the performance of any device.

All of the above characteristics have led to an intensive exploration of the applicability of these materials in (opto)electronics such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), laser dyes, field effect transistors and solar cells.4 In this review, an overview is given of the latest advances in the application of PDIs in the field of solar cells, either as active materials or as functional additives.
2. PDIs as photoactive components in p–n organic solar cells
Bilayer solar cells or flat heterojunction (FHJ) cells are fabricated by placing a layer of a p-type organic semiconductor atop a layer of an n-type one and sandwiching them between an anode and a cathode. This was the architecture employed by Tang for the construction of the first organic solar cell. He used copper phthalocyanine (1) and a benzimidazole derivative of a PDI (2) as the electron donor and acceptor, respectively, (Fig. 2).5 A power conversion efficiency (PCE, the fraction of incident power that is converted to electricity) of 1% was obtained, but this was increased to 2.7% by Forrest on using 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (usually referred to as bathocuproine, 3) as an exciton-blocking layer (EBL).6
 Fig. 2  Structure of an FHJ cell and compounds 1–3. ITO refers to indium tin oxide, which is used as a transparent anode. 
In order to investigate the steric effect of the substituents on the photovoltaic performance, excluding any electronic contribution, FHJ cells were fabricated using three different PDIs (4–6, Fig. 3) as acceptors and 1 as the donor.7 The substituents were introduced at the imide positions, which are electronically decoupled from the aromatic core due to the existence of nodes in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO).1 The current–voltage (J–V) curves of the cells showed a decrease in the short-circuit current density (JSC) but an increase in the open-circuit voltage (VOC) with increasing steric hindrance, while the fill factor (FF) was best for the intermediate case. Thus, the steric bulk must be balanced to maximise PCE. Indeed, the best PCE was obtained for compound 5 (0.65%).

In conclusion, although the substituents at the imide position have an impact on the morphology of the active layer, it is not enough to inhibit intermolecular π–π interactions and, furthermore, the substituents do not have an effect on the energy levels.
The introduction of substituents in the bay positions (Fig. 1) changes the HOMO–LUMO energy levels and can result in twisting of the PDI core, thus decreasing π–π interactions. On this basis, a study was carried out by Nguyen and Sastre-Santos to compare four PDI derivatives (7–10, Fig. 4).8
 Fig. 4  Structures of PDIs 7–10 and tetrabenzoporphyrin 11. 
PDI 7 is a planar molecule with long alkyl chains at the imide position, PDI 8 and PDI 9 are functionalised at the bay position with two or four electron-donating alkylaryloxy substituents, respectively, and PDI 10 has two p-tolylethynyl groups in the 1,7-positions. Compared to PDI 7, the alkylaryloxy groups narrowed the band gap, with the most marked decrease seen in the tetra-substituted PDI 9, while the energy levels of PDI 10 were not significantly affected (the energies of the HOMO and LUMO are −3.8 and −6.0 eV for PDI 7, −3.7 and −5.9 eV for PDI 8, −3.5 and −5.4 eV for PDI 9 and −3.8 and −6.0 eV for PDI 10). All of these materials were tested as acceptors in a bilayer organic photovoltaic (OPV) cell using 29H,31H-tetrabenzo[b,g,l,q]porphyrin (11, Fig. 4) as the donor material, with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and 3 (Fig. 2) as the hole-transport layer (HTL) and EBL, respectively. The resulting device architecture was thus ITO/PEDOT:PSS (50 nm)/11 (50 nm)/PDI (20 nm)/3 (3 nm)/Al. The PCE values of the devices were compared to an optimized device made using [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as acceptor. The highest efficiencies achieved (2.7%) were for devices with PCBM, while the devices with PDI 7 and PDI 10, which have very similar frontier energy levels to PCBM, exhibited PCEs of 2.0% and 1.7%, respectively. PDI 8 and PDI 9 gave very low PCEs (0.4% and 0.02%, respectively) because, despite the high VOC, a low FF and JSC limited their performance. These results are probably in correlation with the very poor electron mobilities of PDI 8 and PDI 9, which have a significant influence on the FF and JSC in OPV devices. In addition, atomic force microscopy indicated that films of PDI 7 and PDI 10 have a crystalline morphology. PDI 8 and PDI 9 films are amorphous and this is consistent with their lower electron mobilities. The authors concluded that there are molecular geometries that can promote ordered thin films, which in turn result in improved electron mobilities and therefore, higher PCEs in OPV devices.
With the purpose of studying how the relative sequence of the different layers in the device affects the efficiency, FHJ solar cells based on perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (12) and zinc phthalocyanine (13) were prepared (Fig. 5).9 Two configurations of the solar cell were studied, namely the commonly employed ITO/13 (30 nm)/12 (20 nm)/Al and the inverted ITO/12 (20 nm)/13 (30 nm)/Al. The active layers were deposited by thermal evaporation. The structural properties of thin films of 12 and 13 were investigated by X-ray diffraction and it was found that both molecules were stacked parallel to the substrate surface. This finding indicates that altering the order of film deposition does not affect the crystallinity of the films.

The normal cell gave a PCE of 0.06% (VOC of 0.273 V, JSC of 0.961 mA cm−2 and FF of 24.20%), while the inverted cell had an improved PCE of 0.96% (VOC of 0.48 V, JSC of 7.72 mA cm−2 and FF of 26.05%). This difference is due to the geometrical rearrangement of 12 and 13. Since 12 absorbs high-energy photons it must be as close as possible to the transparent ITO for efficient harvesting of high-energy photons. The inversion of the acceptor and the donor changed the direction of charge collection and this led to better parameters.
The p–n architecture is characterised by a limited interfacial area between donor and acceptor materials, so that only the molecules near to the border can undergo a photoinduced electron transfer process. The rest of the electroactive molecules, which are inside each layer, will act only as charge transporters and will not have any productive photoactivity, which leads to a waste of photons and low PCEs. Thus, more efficient cell types have been investigated.
3. PDIs as photoactive components in bulk heterojunction solar cells
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells are composed of a unique layer in which donor and acceptor materials are blended. The formation of microdomains increases the interfacial area and, thus, the efficiency of the cells (Fig. 6). Numerous small molecules and polymers have been tested in this kind of cell.10
 Fig. 6  Structure of a BHJ cell. 
PDIs have been widely employed as non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) in BHJ solar cells and have led to great achievements in recent years due to their excellent properties.11 The planar structure of the PDI core has a negative effect on device performance due to the strong π–π stacking. Even though these interactions lead to efficient charge transportation and separation, the tendency for self-aggregation and the low solubility are detrimental for the formation of the active layer.12 Due to the structural characteristics of PDIs, many strategies have been adopted to deal with the problems and these include, for example, twisting the core of the PDI, forming helical oligomers or integrating them into a three-dimensional (3D) structure.13
PDI-based superstructures generated by directly bonding PDI monomers have been successfully incorporated in highly efficient non-fullerene BHJ solar cells thanks to their better matching of HOMO/LUMO energy levels, flexibility and twisted structures. The best results were obtained when suppression of the aggregation was balanced with the preservation of charge carrier mobility and the crystallinity of the films reduced the charge recombination.
Compound 14 was synthesised to study a derivative based on an electron-deficient core and it was compared with 15 (Fig. 7).14 BHJ devices were fabricated using the structure ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th: 14 or 15/MoO3/Ag, where PTB7-Th is poly(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thien-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-3-fluoro-2-(2-ethylhexyloxycarbonyl)thieno[3,4-b]thiophene). Compound 14 has a smaller band gap and wider absorption range in both solution and film and this results in a complementary absorption with PTB7-Th.
 Fig. 7  Structures of molecules 14 and 15. 
Compound 14 exhibited a high PCE of 9.15% (VOC of 0.78 V, JSC of 17.10 mA cm−2, and FF of 68.5%). In contrast, 15 showed a relatively poor PCE of 5.57% (VOC of 0.85 V, JSC of 11.91 mA cm−2, and FF of 54.9%). The electron-deficient triazine core causes dramatic effects on the performance of the BHJ cells.
A study of the geometry of the two derivatives showed that 14 has two PDI units in a relatively coplanar geometry and the lack of hydrogen atoms at the triazine core results in less distortion of the PDI skeleton. This structure should be beneficial for π–π stacking and explains the different charge transport behaviour.
Derivatives 16 and 17 were synthesised as novel acceptors with a star-shaped 3D structure (Fig. 8).15 In 16 the PDI dimeric subunits are connected through single bonds to the central benzene ring, thus leading to a large dihedral angle, while in 17 the subunits are fused to the central benzene ring, which leads to a significantly reduced deviation from planarity according to DFT calculations.

The authors described the fabrication of an inverted device (ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:acceptor/MoO3/Ag) using the commercially available PTB7-Th as the electron donor and 16 or 17 as the electron acceptor. A PDI 18-based device was used as reference. The optimized donor/acceptor (D/A) ratio was 1:1 (w/w), while the addition of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) did not have a positive effect on the efficiency of the devices. The performance of the optimized solar cell was increased by simple thermal annealing at 80 °C for 10 min for all derivatives, with values increasing from 6.71% to 7.70% for 16 and from 7.53% to 8.17 for 17 (VOC of 0.79 V, JSC of 16.77 mA cm−2 and FF of 61.67%) (Table 1).

The higher PCE of 17 suggests that there is a suppression of the self-aggregation while the charge transport properties are preserved. The results demonstrate that the integration of helical PDI oligomers into 3D architectures is a pioneering design strategy to develop NFAs for highly efficient additive-free BHJ solar cells.
In a related study three pairs of PDI-based derivatives with and without ring fusion were compared (19–24, Fig. 9).16 The compounds were investigated with an inverted device structure of ITO/ZnO/P3TEA/acceptor/V2O5/Al, where P3TEA is poly(4,7-bis[3-(2-octyldodecyloxycarbonyl)-4′-(2-hexylnonyl)-2,2′-bithiophen-5-yl]-5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-alt-4,7-bis(thien-2-yl)-5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole), which acts as the electron donor, and the PDI derivatives as the acceptors (Table 2).

In all cases the ring-fused PDIs showed better performance than the non-fused analogues; compound 24 was the best example and it had a PCE of 10.6% (VOC of 1.13 V, JSC of 13.9 mA cm−2 and FF of 66%). The authors concluded that ring fusion and a high average domain purity are key for increasing charge mobilities of the PDIs. The rigidity of the structure increases repulsive molecular interactions and this results in lower miscibility between the donor and the acceptor, while the molecular ordering is maintained. This entails enhanced FFs which, when added to a good structure and morphology, result in the development of efficient BHJ solar cells.
Sulfur- and selenium-containing compounds 25 and 26 were studied as the acceptor component in an inverted configuration of ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:acceptor/MoO3/Ag (Fig. 10 and Table 3).17 The devices were tested with and without the additive DIO and, for each acceptor, the addition of DIO resulted in improved results. Compound 26 showed better performance than 25, with a PCE of 8.82% (VOC of 0.77 V, JSC of 17.15 mA cm−2 and FF of 66.8%). Furthermore, the lower LUMO level of 26 (−3.86 eV vs. −3.48 eV for 25), together with a higher VOC, led to a reduction of the energy loss. The dihedral angles between the two chalcogen-annulated PDIs on both sides and the central PDI for 26 are smaller (55° and 34°) than for 25 (57° and 40°) and, according to the authors, this has positive effects on the formation of more compact aggregates and a higher crystallinity in the solid state. The results indicate that selenium annulation had a positive effect and would be beneficial for more efficient charge transfer in BHJ cells.

In order to increase the structural diversity, a nitrogen heteroatom was incorporated at the bay position of PDIs to allow further tailored self-assembly or functionalisation with alkyl chains to promote higher solubility (compounds 27 and 28 in Fig. 10 and Table 4).18 In this way the authors created a twisted PDI characterised by its ability to act as an electron-transporting material.

Photovoltaic properties were investigated in various device architectures, but the inverted configuration of ITO/ZnO/donor:acceptor/MoO3/Ag gave the best results and was selected for the study. In the initial attempt PTB7, poly(4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-3-fluoro-2-(2-ethylhexyloxycarbonyl)thieno[3,4-b]thiophene), was used as the electron donor and 27 (with N-hexyl chains) as the acceptor. Different blend ratios and amounts of DIO were tested. Although the latter is not a good solvent for either donor or acceptor, it plays an important role in the formation of crystalline domains. In this case, the best PCE was 2.21% (VOC of 0.89 V, JSC of 7.29 mA cm−2 and FF of 34%) upon addition of 8% of DIO.
Film formation for a twisted PDI with long hexyl chains at the nitrogen required the addition of large amounts of DIO. This requirement proved detrimental for the organization of the domains and, as a consequence, an N-ethyl chain (28) was selected for the next studies, in which a PCE of 3.13% was achieved with 3% DIO.
Considering the limited efficiencies, further devices with both PDIs were prepared with the better performing polymer PTB7-Th. The same conditions were used and improved PCEs of 5.13% and 5.54%, as-cast, were obtained for 27 and 28, respectively, thus highlighting the importance of donor selection. The use of DIO had a minimal effect in these cases.
In a final attempt at optimization, polymer P3TEA was tested with 28 in the inverted architecture ITO/ZnO/P3TEA:28/V2O5/Al with a 2:3 donor acceptor ratio. Octanedithiol (ODT, 2.5 v/v%) was added as a volatile solvent additive and a PCE of 7.55% (VOC of 1.13 V, JSC of 11.03 mA cm−2 and FF of 61%) was achieved.
This work highlights the importance of the selection of the ‘R’ group and the donor for the preparation of the active layer.
Further examples of this type of material are based on bay-linked and ortho-linked PDIs.19 Xiao et al. described the synthesis of three new PDI dimers that combine ortho and bay linking (29–31, Fig. 11).20 Short alkyl chains in the imide positions were chosen because of the benefit of the lower steric hindrance for the charge transport. The photovoltaic properties of the derivatives were studied by fabricating BHJ solar cells with an inverted configuration of ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:acceptor/MoO3/Ag, with 29–31 as acceptors (Table 5).

In a first attempt, BHJ cells with a 1:1 blend ratio were optimized and showed average PCEs of 5.83%, 5.13% and 1.76% for 31, 29 and 30, respectively. In an effort to enhance the performance, different additives, such as DIO, chloronaphthalene (CN) and diphenyl ether (DPE), were tested. The PCE values were not improved with CN or DPE, but the addition of DIO to the optimal configuration improved the performance for all the acceptors, with the best PCE being 8.30%, which was obtained for derivative 31 (VOC of 0.799 V, JSC of 18.79 mA cm−2 and FF of 55.3%).
The PCE of 31 (8.30%) is 30% higher than that of 29 (6.41%) and three times higher than that of 30 (2.01%). The low FF value indicates that the performance of the BHJ solar cells could be improved further.
In an effort to combine properties and expand the absorption window of the solar cell, different small molecules have been attached to the PDI. For example, binding PDIs to porphyrins maximises electron transport and photocurrent in the near ultraviolet and visible regions.21 Two new acceptors were synthesised by linking either two or four PDIs to the porphyrin core by p-phenylene connectors to give 32 and 33, respectively (Fig. 12). The absence of π-conjugation between the moieties avoids any redshift of their absorption, thus preserving the near ultraviolet and the violet light responses. In addition, the twisted configuration of the molecule reduces intermolecular π–π stacking.

The electron mobility, which is particularly beneficial for exciton dissociation and reduction of charge recombination, increased with the number of PDI moieties.
4. PDIs as photoactive components in dye sensitised solar cells
Since O’Regan and Grätzel published the invention of dye sensitised solar cells (DSSCs) in 1991,22 intense research has been devoted to this field.23 A typical DSSC device consists of: (i) a glass surface onto which is deposited a transparent conductive oxide (TCO), usually ITO or fluorine-doped tin oxide F:SnO2 (FTO), which acts as the anode; (ii) a mesoporous semiconductor oxide layer, normally TiO2; (iii) the dye, a sensitiser responsible for the capture of photons; (iv) an electrolyte consisting of a redox couple that surrounds the dye; and (v) a counter-electrode (cathode) that transfers electrons from the external circuit back to the electrolyte (Fig. 13).
 Fig. 13  Structure of a DSSC. 
The operation of a DSSC cell involves the following steps: (i) light is absorbed by the dye and one electron is promoted from the HOMO level to the LUMO level. (ii) Electron injection into the conduction band of the TiO2 and migration through the porous structure to the TCO. (iii) The electron is conducted by an external circuit to the metallic counter electrode. (iv) The electrolyte transfers an electron to the HOMO level of the sensitiser and directs the transport of holes to the counter electrode, where recombination occurs, to finish the cycle.
The dye plays a very important role in this type of cell, since it is responsible for absorbing the radiation and the generation of the charge-separated state. The first cells were made using ruthenium-based sensitisers and efficiencies of 10–11% were achieved.24 However, due to the high manufacturing cost and low extinction coefficients, ruthenium-free compounds have been sought and among them are phthalocyanines,25 porphyrins,26 coumarins,27 phenothiazines,28 indolizines,29etc. PDIs and some related derivatives, namely perylenemonoanhydridemonoimide (PMAMI), have also been employed as dyes.
The first report concerning the application of PDIs as sensitisers in DSSCs dates back to 1997.30 PDI 34 has carboxylic acid groups to anchor onto SnO2 (Fig. 14) and this was used in conjunction with a solution of 0.5 M LiBr, 0.05 M Br2, and 0.2 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile as electrolyte to yield an overall cell efficiency of 0.89% (VOC 0.45 V, JSC 3.26 mA cm−2, FF 45.5%). In 2002, a film of 35 (Fig. 14) on TiO2 was prepared and characterised.31 The film yielded an incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of approximately 14% in the wavelength region from 460 to 510 nm. In the same year compound 36, with an anhydride group to anchor onto TiO2 (Fig. 14), was studied and this gave an IPCE of approximately 20% and an overall cell efficiency of 0.45% (VOC of 0.32 V, JSC of 4.5 mA cm−2, FF not reported).32 A series of PMAMIs were subsequently synthesised (37–41, Fig. 14).33 The aim of this study was to analyse how the variation of alkyl chains at the imide position affected the performance of the cell. The results showed that increasing the steric hindrance of the chains (longer and more branched chains) led to improved efficiencies, with PMAMI 37 showing the highest efficiency (1.61% under AM 1.5 solar light).
 Fig. 14  Structures of compounds 34–41. 
A breakthrough was made in 2007 with the introduction of 1,7-pyrrolidine-substituted derivatives 42–45 which bear electron-donating groups in the bay positions (Fig. 15).34 DSSCs were fabricated with 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, 0.6 M 2,3-dimethyl-1-propylimidazolium iodide, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile as electrolyte, and the current–voltage characteristics were measured under AM 1.5 conditions.
 Fig. 15  Structures of compounds 42–45. 
Sensitiser 42 gave the highest efficiency of 2.6% (VOC of 0.54 V, JSC of 7.8 mA cm−2 and FF of 63%) due to the strong donor capacity of the pyrrolidine groups, which would improve the transfer of electrons from the dye to the conduction band of the TiO2. In addition, the presence of substituents in the bay positions would hinder the aggregation of the dye on the metal oxide surface, thus decreasing intermolecular charge recombination.
Closely related to this issue, the effect of phenoxy or piperidinyl substituents in the bay positions of the perylene core was investigated.35 DSSCs made with 0.6 M 1-methyl-3-n-propyl imidazolium iodide, 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2 and 0.1 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in propylene carbonate as electrolyte, and using as dyes PMAMIs 46, 47, 48 and 49 (Fig. 16), showed efficiencies of 0.96% (VOC of 0.456 V, JSC of 2.9 mA cm−2 and FF of 71%), 1.42% (VOC of 0.450 V, JSC of 4.9 mA cm−2 and FF of 64%), 1.64% (VOC of 0.520 V, JSC of 4.1 mA cm−2 and FF of 76%) and 2.29% (VOC of 0.550 V, JSC of 6.2 mA cm−2 and FF of 67%), respectively. Sensitisers 48 and 49 have four phenoxy groups, which leads to a similar effect to two piperidinyl groups with respect to the electron donor strength but with lower propensity to aggregation. These compounds gave higher efficiencies than 46 and 47. Another example of how the presence of highly crowded donor groups can increase the photovoltaic performance is provided by the PMAMI 50, with four tetramethylbutylphenoxy groups in the bay positions. This compound yielded an efficiency of 3.15% (VOC of 0.520 V, JSC of 9.20 mA cm−2 and FF of 65.87%) under standard conditions.36
 Fig. 16  Structures of PMAMIs 46–51. 
The 1,7-dipiperidine-substituted perylene 51, containing an azacrown subunit capable of selectively binding lithium ions, was synthesised and studied in DSSCs (Fig. 16). Devices made using 51 gave higher voltages but a lower photocurrent under simulated sunlight than the analogue without the azacrown moiety.37
PDIs 52 and 53 were synthesised with the aim of expanding the absorption spectrum of the PDI core (Fig. 17).38 Although both had broad absorption bands with high molar extinction coefficients throughout the visible spectrum, the DSSCs yielded low efficiencies (0.34% for 52 and 1.38% for 53). The authors explained these results as being a consequence of the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the imide group which avoids charge transfer from sensitiser to the conduction band of the metal oxide.
 Fig. 17  Structures of PDIs 52–53. 
Functionalisation in the imide positions with electron-donating groups in order to create a dipole moment in the dye, and thus stimulate the electron injection efficiency, has also been carried out. The spiro-perylenecarboximide compound 54 contains an anhydride moiety as the anchoring group, a spirobifluorene-bridge for efficient charge separation, and a diphenylamine unit that acts as a donor (Fig. 18).39 The resulting device gave an efficiency of 1.72%.
 Fig. 18  Structures of PMAMIs 54–56. 
PMAMIs 55 and 56, which bear linked triphenylamine moieties, show efficiencies of 1.0% and 1.3%, respectively (Fig. 18).40 Even though the design of the dyes 54–56 is suitable to favour the electron transfer, this process seems to be disadvantaged.
To the best of our knowledge, the highest efficiency reported to date in PDI derivatives for DSSCs corresponds to compound 50. This molecule bears four sterically demanding phenoxy groups in the bay positions and an anhydride group for anchoring to the TiO2.
Regarding perylenemonoanhydride (PMA) in DSSCs, only PMAs 57 (6.8%, VOC of 0.728 V, JSC of 12.60 mA cm−2 and FF of 74%),4158 (3.9%, VOC of 0.651 V, JSC of 10.4 mA cm−2 and FF of 58%) and 59 (3.2%, VOC of 0.696 V, JSC of 7.96 mA cm−2 and FF of 59%)42 have shown higher efficiencies than PMAMI 50 (Fig. 19). The common feature in these compounds is the presence of a sterically demanding diarylamine donor group in the peri position, with PMA 57 also bearing two thiophenoxy groups in bay positions, which strongly promote the high efficiency obtained.

5. PDIs in perovskite solar cells
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted a great deal of attention during the past few years.43 Perovskites used in solar cells possess a crystal structure of ABX3 type, where A is an organic cation like methylammonium, ethylammonium or formamidinium, B is usually Pb2+, and X is a halide anion with iodide being the most used, although bromide and chloride are often used mixed with iodide.
PSCs are a new generation of hybrid inorganic–organic solar cells with broad light absorption, a high extinction coefficient, and large charge carrier diffusion lengths. These systems have been proposed as substitutes for silicon-based cells as conversion efficiencies over 22% have been achieved. Moreover, the manufacturing costs are low, as the reagents used for their synthesis are not expensive and the processing does not require high temperatures. Negative aspects include the toxicity of lead and the problems of degradation due to exposure to moisture and ultraviolet radiation. However, the use of a lead-free all-inorganic perovskite as the light absorber has recently been reported, with an efficiency of up to 7.11% and high stability achieved.44
PSCs integrate (i) the perovskite photoactive film, (ii) the interfacial layers that are between the active layer and the electrodes to facilitate the charge transport processes (there are two types: electron transport materials, ETMs, and hole transport materials, HTMs) and (iii) the electrodes. Nevertheless, in terms of charge collection strategy there are two different architectures, namely normal cell (n–i–p), which is similar to the DSSC device structure, and inverted cell (p–i–n), in which the main difference is that the current flows in opposite directions (Fig. 20). Furthermore, depending on whether the device contains a mesoporous medium or not, the perovskite solar cell can be classified as having either mesoporous or planar structure. Mesoporous PSCs use an n–i–p type design because of the need for the deposition of the porous medium onto a TCO electrode. Planar PSCs commonly use a p–i–n design along with both HTM and ETM in their structures, which significantly enhances the collection of photogenerated holes and electrons.45
 Fig. 20  Structure of PSCs. 
The use of PDIs in PSCs was introduced by Das et al., who demonstrated that PDI 60 could be used as the HTM (Fig. 21).46 Three different solar cell architectures were evaluated: mesoporous TiO2, mesoporous Al2O3 and planar on dense TiO2, with CH3NH3PbBr3 as the light absorber. The best performing device was mesoporous TiO2 with an efficiency of 5.6% (VOC of 1.23 V, JSC of 7.6 mA cm−2 and FF of 60.7%).
 Fig. 21  Structures of PDIs 60–65. 
New organic ETMs with an inverted cell as an alternative to PCBMs have been reported, mainly since 2016. Thus, a device (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/61/TiO2/Al) was prepared that included 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzoimidazole, DMBI, as dopant in PDI ETM. This device gave an efficiency of 10% (VOC of 0.86 V, JSC of 21.6 mA cm−2 and FF of 54%) as a result of an improvement in charge transfer at the perovskite–PDI interface.47 Another example is provided by PDIs 62–64 (Fig. 21). The best result was achieved by PDI 64 with an efficiency of 3.23% without a solution processed ZnO nanoparticles cathode buffer layer (i.e., only slightly below that presented by PCBM, which gave 4.13%). PDIs 62 and 63 gave efficiencies of 0.66% and 0%, respectively, with the result for 63 being due to the low solubility of the compound.48 In the same way, PDI 65 (Fig. 21) proved to be a substitute for fullerene derivatives and in this case the cell that incorporated the PDI gave an efficiency of 11% (VOC of 0.93 V, JSC of 19.31 mA cm−2 and FF of 61.48%), while the one with PCBM gave 10%.49
The π-conjugated PDI 66 (Fig. 22) was studied as an interfacial layer between TiO2 and perovskite. This material gave an enhanced device efficiency of 19.84% in addition to suppressed interfacial recombination and reduced hysteresis.50
 Fig. 22  Structure of compounds 66–69. 
The fused PDIs 67 and 68 (Fig. 22) have been used as ETMs for inverted PSCs with the structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/ETM/Ag and they gave PCEs of 11.0% and 12.0%, respectively (the authors did not provide other photovoltaic parameters). However, when the fused PDI 67 was covalently attached to a triptycene hub, the resulting 3D nanostructure, 69, yielded an efficiency of 18.0% (other photovoltaic parameters were not provided).51 Another 3D PDI, 70, was tested (Fig. 23) and an efficiency of 16.29% (VOC of 1.013 V, JSC of 21.68 mA cm−2 and FF of 74%) was achieved, which was higher than that obtained using a PCBM-based electron transporting layer under the same test conditions. This demonstrates again the great potential of PDIs to replace fullerene-based electron transport layers in inverted PSCs.52 This compound has also been used as an interfacial layer between perovskite and C60, where a higher efficiency was reached (18.78%, VOC of 1.052 V, JSC of 21.98 mA cm−2 and FF of 81%) compared to the efficiency (16.56%) without this interlayer.
 Fig. 23  Structures of PDIs 70–72. 
Fluorinated PDI 71 (Fig. 23) has been employed as an organic ETM in planar heterojunction PSCs because the presence of fluorine in PDIs increases their electron mobility and air-stability. A PDI 71 layer was vacuum vapour deposited onto the ITO, then the films were treated by solvent spin-coating or solvent vapour annealing to achieve a better control over the film morphology. The best device provided an efficiency of 7.93% (VOC of 0.96 V, JSC of 14.09 mA cm−2 and FF of 55.20%).53 Another example of how the introduction of fluoro-substituents in PDIs improves the stability of PSCs is provided by PDI 72 (Fig. 23). In this case, the presence of fluorinated alkyl chains at the imide positions not only improves thermal and moisture stabilities, but also devices based on MAPbI3 and Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(Br0.17I0.83)3 absorber (where MA stands for methylammonium and FA for formamidinium) achieved efficiencies of 18.28% (VOC of 1.023 V, JSC of 22.05 mA cm−2 and FF of 81.01%) and 19.26% (VOC of 1.065 V, JSC of 22.74 mA cm−2 and FF of 79.90%), respectively.54
PDI 73 has also been used as a substitute for TiO2 as an ETM in planar heterojunction PSCs (Fig. 24). Two types of device structures were fabricated on both rigid (glass/FTO) and flexible (poly(ethylene terephthalate)/ITO) substrates. Efficiencies of 17.66% (VOC of 1.08 V, JSC of 21.80 mA cm−2 and FF of 75%) and 14.32% (VOC of 1.05 V, JSC of 20.05 mA cm−2 and FF of 68%), respectively, were obtained. The authors explained that the aminoalkyl groups at imide positions in PDI 73 enhanced the wetting capability of surfaces to perovskite and lowered the surface work function of conductive oxide substrates via the amino group, which produces a large dipole moment at the FTO substrate/PDI interface, as well as passivating the surface trap states of the perovskite films.55
 Fig. 24  Structures of PDIs 73–75. 
PDI dimer 74 and its ammonium bromide salt 75 have been employed as substitutes for PCBM as the organic ETM in planar perovskite solar cells (Fig. 24). The performances of 74, 75 and PCBM were tested and efficiencies of 13.5% (VOC of 1.03 V, JSC of 20.5 mA cm−2 and FF of 63.8%), 17.1% (VOC of 1.08 V, JSC of 21.3 mA cm−2 and FF of 74.5%) and 17.5% (VOC of 1.09 V, JSC of 21.6 mA cm−2 and FF of 74.3%), respectively, were obtained. It seems that the introduction of PDIs in salt form improves their behaviour in PSCs.56
6. PDIs as ETM in BHJ solar cells
In order to reach high efficiencies many components of organic solar cells require simultaneous interaction and, among these components, interfacial layers (IFLs) represent some indispensable elements. IFLs work to transport charges of just one type, either holes or electrons, from the active layer to the electrode and they also influence the contacts with both the electrode and active layer. It is also known that inverted solar cells collect electrons at the ITO electrode and these require n-type IFLs, amongst which the most studied are inorganic compounds. However, one of the drawbacks of these materials is that they require expensive and complicated vacuum evaporation techniques and they also have a poor interfacial contact with the organic active layer. In contrast, organic compounds such as PDIs exhibit high electron affinities and this makes them candidates for n-type IFLs.
PDI 76 (Fig. 25) was synthesised to connect the ITO electrode to a BHJ layer, which consisted of a mixture of a π-conjugated polymer and PCBM. Due to its polar character, a PDI 76 film functioned as a good adhesion layer between inorganic electrodes and the organic active layer. The performance of the cell containing the PDI 76 film was comparable to that obtained using caesium carbonate.57
 Fig. 25  Structures of PDIs 76–79. 
It has also been observed that devices containing PDI 77 IFLs had increased efficiency with respect to the standard devices in inverted non-fullerene solar cells.58 Moreover PDIs 77 and 78 have been described as thickness-insensitive IFLs due to the π–π stacking of these compounds in solid state, which would lead to the formation of layers from 6 to 25 nm. Thus, a PDI 78-based device exhibited an efficiency of 8.24% (VOC of 0.749 V, JSC of 15.00 mA cm−2 and FF of 73.30%) while the reference Ca/Al-based device gave a value of 6.98% (VOC of 0.712 V, JSC of 14.50 mA cm−2 and FF of 67.67%).59 Moreover, it has been reported that the incorporation of PDI 78 as an IFL between the PCBM layer and the top Ag electrode increased the efficiency from 10% to 14%, while the PCBM/ZnO/Ag device yielded an efficiency of 11.3%. The authors explained this effect as being due to the optimisation of the contact between the PCBM and Ag electrode, which in turn led to reduced series resistance and enhanced shunt resistance values.60
PDI 78 has also been used between a fullerene derivative and the Ag cathode to replace barium. A higher efficiency was obtained when PDI 78 was deposited as the electron extraction layer (14.3%) compared to that obtained with barium (13.7%).61 The integration of the water-soluble PDI 79 between a PBTI3T:PC71BM layer and the top Al electrode showed an efficiency of 7% due to better electron transfer between active layer materials and PDI 79 when compared with the inorganic LiF layer.62
On the other hand, the structure of PDI 80 (Fig. 26) has enabled the formation of nanorod J-aggregates in films and these showed good electron transport properties. As compared with the control cell (5.71% efficiency), the introduction of a PDI 80 interlayer clearly improved the performance of the cell (9.11% efficiency).63
 Fig. 26  Structures of PDIs 80–86. 
The ability to act as n-type self-dopable systems, in which the dopants are connected to the host by covalent or ionic, bonds, was tested with fifteen PDIs with a general structure PDI 81–83 (amine) and 84–86 (ammonium salts). These compounds were used to make organic solar cells with the device structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/IFL/Ag. The authors commented that the electron transfer properties of PDIs were markedly affected by different end-groups and π-deficient backbones, with the best performance (PCE of 10.06%) obtained with PDI 86.64
PDIs 87 and 88 (Fig. 27) have been used as n-type electron transport layers in polymer solar cells. Both of these compounds were designed to have increased solubility in water/alcohol solvents and to provide the required film thickness. The photovoltaic performance was evaluated by building inverted device structures, with efficiencies of 0.9%, 3.5% and 3.1% achieved for a cathode buffer layer of ITO, ITO/PDI 87 and ITO/PDI 88, respectively.65

7. Conclusion and outlook
Due to their high chemical versatility, extraordinary absorption and fluorescence, n-type semiconducting properties and (photo)stability, perylenediimides have become one of the most investigated compounds among the photoactive components in solar cells during the last decade. For the future development of high performance photovoltaic devices, research on PDIs would possibly still be dominant. The selection of appropriate substituents to achieve finely controlled aggregation and transporting properties seems to be the major research direction. We believe that this minireview provides an overview of the most recent progress in this particular field and will serve as guide for the development of new PDIs in the search for high efficiency photovoltaic devices.
