    , Accepted 3rd December 2019First published on 4th December 2019AbstractFerroelectric photovoltaic (FE-PV) materials with excellent photocurrent output have stimulated many recent studies in solar energy material fields. How to improve the photocurrent by designing the structure of materials and devices through a simple approach is still a challenge. Here, enhanced photocurrent in Bi2FeMo0.7Ni0.3O6 (BFMNO) ferroelectric thin films is achieved by tuning the thickness of the thin films. With the increase of the thickness, the short circuit current increases first and then decreases. The maximum short circuit current reaches 0.09 mA cm−2 under 100 mW cm−2 when the thickness is 700 nm, which is nearly triple that of the thin film with the thickness of 570 nm. It is proposed that the compensation effect of the driving force comprising the depolarization field and build-in field is the main reason for the enhanced photocurrent. This work highlights a simple approach to enhance the photocurrent of FE-PV materials based on tuning of the thickness.
1. Introduction
Driven by the growing demand for clean and renewable energy, various solar energy materials and solar cells have been researched to convert photo energy into electric energy through the photovoltaic effect.1–11 Due to the different mechanisms of exciton separation, the nature of the photovoltaic effect is also different in photovoltaic materials. For instance, the photogenerated electrons and holes are separated by the built-in electric field inside the p–n junction.12 The ferroelectric photovoltaic (FE-PV) effect occurs when ferroelectric polarization is the driving force for the exciton separation, which is completely different from the p–n junction mechanism.13–15 Thus, the FE-PV effect couples ferroelectric polarization with optical properties. Therefore, the direction of the photocurrent depends on the polarization orientation.16–21 Moreover, the anomalous photovoltaic effect shows that voltage output can be significantly larger than the bandgap of the ferroelectric materials.22–25 However, a great challenge for FE-PV materials is the extremely low photocurrent output, which limits the power conversion efficiency (PCE). Therefore, searching for feasible and highly efficient ways to improve the PV effect of FE-PV materials is an urgent research task. A considerable number of works were carried out and many breakthrough achievements have been achieved. The breakthrough efficiency of 8.1% was obtained under AM 1.5 G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) by bandgap (Eg) engineering in a double perovskite multiferroic oxide Bi2FeCrO6.5 In addition, the efficiency of 4.80% under 1 sun was obtained by nanoscale electrode probing in ferroelectric BaTiO3 crystals.26 Recently, a PCE of 4.20% has been achieved under 1 sun illumination in Bi–Mn–O composite thin films with mixed BiMnO3 and BiMn2O5 crystal phases.27 Based on the above research, it can be concluded that the design of the structure improves the photovoltaic performances of the ferroelectric films effectively. It is generally believed that the FE-PV properties in ferroelectric materials are mainly related to the bandgap, polarization, interface barriers and so on, which are determined by the structure of ferroelectric materials and PV devices.
It is noteworthy that the thickness of ferroelectric thin films also plays an important role in tuning PV properties in FE-PV materials. Gao et al. found that the regulation of polarization achieved by changing the thickness of BiFeO3 film leads to an increase of efficiency, whereby the PCE was enhanced from 0.015% to 0.242%.28 Huang et al. reported the phase evolution caused by increasing the thickness in BiFeO3 thin films, leading to a result that the photocurrent increases from 500 pA to 1000 pA.29 Moreover, S. Y. Yang et al. probed the thickness dependence of the photovoltage originating from both the interface depletion and ferroelectric polarization, reaching an apparent maximum of ∼0.8–0.9 V.30 Therefore, it is essential to optimize the thickness of ferroelectric thin films to obtain enhanced photovoltaic properties. Here, we have prepared polycrystalline Bi2FeMo0.7Ni0.3O6 (BFMNO) thin films with different thicknesses on Pt(111)/TiO2/SiO2/Si substrates. The effect of the thickness on the light absorption, polarization and PV properties of BFMNO films has been investigated.
2. Materials and methods
The BFMNO thin films of different thickness have been fabricated on a Pt(111)/TiO2/SiO2/Si substrate via a sol–gel process. Stoichiometric amounts of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, C4H6NiO4·4H2O, and (NH4)6MO7O24·4H2O were dissolved in 2-methoxyethanol to prepare a precursor solution with a concentration of 0.1 mol L−1. In order to disperse the metal ions uniformly in the sol system, and simultaneously to improve the stability and decomposition temperature of the citrate, thereby increasing the stability of the colloid, citric acid was added into the solution to function as a complexing agent. In order to compensate for the loss of volatile Bi during high temperature annealing, an excess of 5% bismuth nitrate was added into the solution. The precursor solution was spin-coated onto the Pt(111)/TiO2/SiO2/Si substrate at 3000 rpm for 20 s and then dried at 150 °C for 5 minutes, subsequently pyrolyzed at 400 °C for 10 minutes, and finally annealed at 600 °C for 3 minutes. The last layer was annealed at 700 °C for 10 minutes to increase the densification and crystallization of the BFMNO thin films. The BFMNO thin films of different thicknesses (570 to 770 nm) were obtained by controlling the number of multiple coatings.
To measure the PV properties, top circular electrodes of Au (diameter = 1 mm) were deposited on the surface of BFMNO thin films by a sputtering method using vacuum ion sputtering equipment (VIS, GS1600) with a current of 4 mA for 15 minutes. The optical transmission and absorption were measured using a UV-Visible spectrometer (Hitachi U-3900). The phase structure was examined using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker, D8 Advance diffractometer). The cross-sectional microstructure analysis and energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) were performed using scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, FEI Quanta 200, FEG). The surface topography was measured by atomic force microscopy (an AFM, Bruker, Icon system). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the BFMNO films were studied using an electrometer (Keithley, 6517B) and simulative sunlight source (Solar500). The ferroelectric hysteresis loops (P–E) and current density–electric field (J–E) of the films were measured using a Ferroelectric tester (Radiant Technologies, Inc. Albuquerque, NM). The dielectric properties were measured using an impedance analyzer (IA, Keysight, E4900A).
3. Results and discussion
The cross-sectional SEM images of the BFMNO thin films are shown in Fig. 1a–d. All thin films exhibit dense microstructures, and the interface between BFMNO and Pt can be identified clearly. The thickness (d) of the thin films is about 570 nm, 640 nm,700 nm and 770 nm, respectively. The surface morphological feature of the BFMNO thin film with d = 700 nm is displayed in Fig. 1e. The thin film exhibits a uniform surface without any cracks. Bi, Fe, Mo and Ni elements were identified by elemental maps, as shown in Fig. 1f. It is found that Bi, Fe, Mo and Ni elements are dispersed homogeneously in the thin film. The elementary composition was confirmed by EDS (Fig. 1g). The spectrum of the thin film with d = 700 nm consists of Bi, Fe, Mo, Ni and O peaks, and no other elements are detected. Other thin films with different thicknesses exhibit a similar surface morphology and elementary composition. The AFM images of the surfaces are shown in Fig. 2. Owing to the optimized deposition conditions adopted in this work, BFMNO thin films exhibit dense, smooth and crack-free surface structures. The surface roughness of the thin films is 9.2, 9.5, 10.1 and 10.5 nm with the increase of the thickness. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the XRD pattern of the BFMNO thin film with d = 700 nm deposited on a Pt substrate. Excluding the diffraction peaks of Pt in the substrate, the other peaks indicate a rhombohedral perovskite structure for the polycrystalline BFMNO thin film.8 The structure of the other films also maintains the same rhombohedral perovskite structure.

The schematic of the photovoltaic device in this work is presented in the inset of Fig. 3a, where the area of Au top electrode is 0.00785 cm2. To assess the effect of thickness on PV properties, the electric current density (J) as a function of external electric field is measured under the irradiation of 100 mW cm−2 (Fig. 3a). In the dark, it is found that the current curve goes through the origin coordinates. Under illumination, the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) change when the thickness of the thin films increases (Fig. 3c). Jsc increases first and then decreases with the increase of the thickness from 570 nm to 770 nm (Fig. 3d). When the thickness is 700 nm, the thin film has the highest Jsc, which reaches 0.09 mA cm−2, which is nearly triple that of the thin film with the thickness of 570 nm. In addition, the Voc just increases slightly, due to the fact that Voc is in direct proportion to the distance between the electrodes.23 Moreover, the photovoltaic properties of the films with the thicknesses of 900 and 970 nm are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The Jsc and Voc tend towards saturation when the thickness is above 900 nm. In addition, it is found that the BFMNO thin films have an obvious PV effect even though they are not polarized, indicating that the PV effect may originate from the ferroelectric self-polarization of the BFMNO thin films,31–33 which has an upwards polarization direction (from Pt to Au). When a downward poling of +10 V is applied, the direction of the Jsc changes, and the value of the current density is smaller than that of the as-grown thin film (Fig. S3, ESI†), indicating that the self-polarization is firm. According to the results, it can be concluded that the thickness of the BFMNO thin films has a significant influence on the photocurrent. It is then natural to ask how the thickness tunes the PV effect.

In nature, the photovoltaic performance of FE-PV materials is closely related to light absorption and photogenerated carrier separation. The level of light absorption is mainly determined by the bandgap. Therefore, to further explore the mechanism of the PV effect by tuning the thickness of the thin films, the thickness-dependence of the bandgap is investigated first. Fig. 4a shows the UV-visible absorption spectra of the BFMNO thin films with different thicknesses. Effective absorption is obtained from 400 nm to 650 nm in the visible region, indicating that the thin films have the capacity to absorb a considerable amount of visible light. The intensity of light absorption increases gradually with the increase of the thickness, indicating that increasing the film thickness is favorable for the light absorption. The bandgap is calculated using the Tauc plot, i.e., a linear extrapolation of (αhν)2versus hν (Fig. 4b–e).34–37 The optical bandgap decreases slightly from 1.96 eV to 1.92 eV with the increase of the thickness. According to the results, the bandgap just has a tiny reduction, which is unable to cause a great change of the photocurrent. Therefore, the bandgap is not the dominant reason for the change of the PV properties in the BFMNO thin films with different thicknesses.

When the electron–hole pairs are generated by incident photons, the dissociation efficiency is also a determining factor in the magnitude of the photocurrent. Therefore, the binding energy of the excitons and the driving force of dissociation need to be probed. Fig. 5a shows the dielectric constant (ε) of BFMNO films with different thicknesses. ε increases when the thickness increases from 570 nm to 700 nm, and dielectric loss (tanδ) just has a slight change with the increase of thickness and frequency. It is known that the binding energy of the electron–hole pairs is inversely proportional to the dielectric constant of the material.12 That is, a ferroelectric thin film with a large dielectric constant has a low binding energy of the electron–hole pairs. Therefore, a thicker film has a lower binding energy of the excitons, which can lead to high exciton dissociation efficiency. Fig. 5b shows the ferroelectric hysteresis loops of the BFMNO thin films. The saturation polarization (Ps) and remnant polarization (Pr) increase with the increase of the thickness (inset of Fig. 5b). The enhanced polarization can induce a large depolarization field (Edp), which contributes to the increase of the driving force for the separation of the excitons. In fact, however, the Jsc increases first and then decreases as the thickness increases, which is opposite to the trend of the polarization at the biggest thickness. These results imply that other driving forces exist in the thin films, which may be a crucial factor for the PV effect of the BFMNO thin films as well.

Generally, when the ferroelectric semiconductor contacts the metal electrode, the Schottky contact may be formed, which induces a built-in field (Ebi) to drive the separation of the excitons.30,38 Thus, it is considered whether the Ebi is formed as a driving force in the Pt/BFMNO/Au devices. The J–E curves of the Pt/BFMNO/Au devices are shown in Fig. 6a. It is observed that the J–E curves are asymmetric, indicating that the two interfaces (Pt/BFMNO and Au/BFMNO) have different contact modes. According to the interface-limited Schottky emission conduction, the plot of ln(J/T2) versus E1/2 for the thin film with the thickness of 700 nm shows a linear relation (Fig. 6b), indicating that the Pt/BFMNO interface under negative bias voltage possesses a Schottky conduction mechanism.38,39 Moreover, Schottky conduction is also verified at different temperatures (Fig. S4, ESI†). However, the J–E curves of the Au/BFMNO interfaces under positive bias voltage do not follow the Schottky conduction. The contact mechanism is Ohmic conduction due to the linear relation between J and E (Fig. 6c).40 The BFMNO thin films with different thicknesses (d = 570, 640, and 770 nm) show similar conduction behavior (Fig. S2, ESI†). The results indicate that Pt/BFMNO/Au has a Schottky-to-Ohmic contact. As it was assumed that the BFMNO thin film is nonpolar, Pt/BFMNO/Au would form a back-to-back Schottky contact. The corresponding energy band diagram is shown in Fig. 6d. Based on the J–E analysis, the actual energy band alignment of Pt/BFMNO/Au is shown in Fig. 6e. The energy band alignment is caused by the self-polarization of the BFMNO thin films, which increases the potential of the polarization head interface. Therefore, the driving electric field consists of Edp and Ebi, which are induced by the self-polarization and Schottky barrier, respectively. In addition, it is found that J increases with the increase of the thickness under negative bias voltage, while J changes slightly under positive bias voltage (Fig. 6a). It is proposed that the Schottky barrier height (SBH) decreases with the increase of the thickness. It is known that SBH can be calculated by the function relationship between capacitance and electric field, where SBH and effective doping concentration (ND) show an opposite relationship. It is found that ND increases with the increase of the thickness, indicating that SBH decreases as the thickness increases (Fig. S3, ESI†). The corresponding energy band alignment of the BFMNO thin films with different thicknesses is shown in Fig. 6f. Accordingly, Ebi decreases when the thickness increases.

Based on the results, Edp and Ebi have opposite trends with the increase of the thickness. The polarization of the thin films increases, leading to the increase of the Edp (Fig. 7). In addition, the decrease of the SBH causes a diminution in the Ebi (Fig. 7). In view of the development trend of the photocurrent, it is proposed that the Edp, which has a similar trend to the photocurrent, is the dominant driving force for the exciton separation. However, the contribution of the Ebi is not neglected. The contribution of the Edp and Ebi is represented in Fig. 7. When d < d1 (e.g. d = 570, and 640 nm), the total driving field (Etot) is low due to a small Edp, leading to a tiny photocurrent. When d > d1 (e.g. d = 700 nm), the Edp exhibits a rapid increase, which enhances the photocurrent sharply. Upon further increasing d (d > d2), the Edp increases slowly while the Ebi decreases rapidly, leading to the result that the Etot begins to decrease. Thus, the thin film with d = 700 nm possesses the maximum photocurrent. It is concluded that the Edp and Ebi have a compensation effect for the driving force. Therefore, the photocurrent can be enhanced by tuning the thickness of the BFMNO thin films.

4. Conclusions
The BFMNO thin films with different thicknesses were prepared via a sol–gel process. The ferroelectric thin films exhibit a thickness-dependent PV effect. With the increase of the thickness, the Jsc increases from 0.03 to 0.09 mA cm−2. The improvement of the photocurrent is attributed to the combined effect of Edp and Ebi, which are induced by self-polarization and interface barrier potential, respectively. These results demonstrate that the BFMNO thin films have great potential in the FE-PV field, and the tuning of the thickness is a promising strategy to improve the FE-PV effect.
