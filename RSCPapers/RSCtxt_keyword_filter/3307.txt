    , Accepted 23rd January 2021First published on 25th January 2021AbstractIn this work, we employ a simple hydrothermal method to synthesize a metal–organic framework (MOF) derived selenide from a reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/structured zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF). The resulting MOF-derived selenide (rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2) consists of porous nanowires encapsulated in a carbon matrix and having a high surface area (169.30 m2 g−1). This porous rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 is combined with polystyrene sulfonate-doped poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT:PSS) for use as a CE for DSSCs. CEs based on different weight percentages (1, 3, and 5 wt%) of rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 powder in PEDOT:PSS solution are compared with the commonly used platinum (Pt) based CE. The rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS composite benefits from the synergistic effects between porous rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 having a high surface area and PEDOT:PSS which holds superior conductivity and strong binding capability with a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate. Therefore, the 3 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS composite based CE achieved a good stability and superior electrocatalytic activity compared to Pt CE. Furthermore, DSSCs based on a 3 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS composite CE achieved a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.60%, compared to the PCE of the Pt CE based DSSC (7.14%) prepared under similar conditions. This work has revealed a new approach to prepare MOF-derived selenide based CEs with high electrocatalytic activity without any calcination. In addition, we demonstrated that the low-cost 3 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS composite CE is an excellent candidate to replace Pt CE in DSSCs.
Introduction
Since the introduction of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) in 1991, this technology has gained considerable attention for its application in the field of green and sustainable energy. Today, with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) reaching around 14%,1 DSSCs are generally made of three major components, including a dye loaded TiO2 semiconductor film used as the photoanode, an electrolyte redox couple, and a counter electrode (CE). In the design of a DSSC, the CE is of high importance. Indeed, it allows the adjustment of the catalytic reduction of the redox couples, exerting a noticeable influence on the PCE of the DSSC. Consequently, research studies directed towards the improvement of CEs for DSSCs are very relevant for increasing the device efficiency, as well as reducing the manufacturing cost.2–5 Generally speaking, DSSCs use platinum (Pt) material as the CE. However, the high cost of Pt has led researchers to look for cheaper alternatives having a similar or better performance as CEs for DSSCs.3–6
In the past years, various carbon nanostructures such as carbon black (CB), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), carbon nanofibers (CNFs), graphene (GN), graphene hydrogel (GH), and mesoporous carbon (MC) have been widely used as potential alternative CEs to Pt, given their high electrocatalytic activity and high surface area.7–18 In recent years, transition metal chalcogenides such as metal selenides, metal sulfides, and metal tellurides have been largely investigated due to their unique electronic structure which is similar to Pt.19–26 Among these metal chalcogenides, metal selenides exhibit the most promising performance.27–30 Different methods have been used so far to improve their electrochemical performance among which, the use of porous nanostructures has recently been intensely investigated in various energy fields. Indeed, porous nanostructures are popular for their large surface area, reduced diffusion pathway, kinetically favorable surface permeability, and low density.31–34
A novel type of functional material known as metal–organic framework (MOF), has drawn significant interest from researchers because of its well-defined morphology, controllable shape and size, diverse chemical composition, large specific surface area, stable structure and tailored functionalities.35,36 Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the combination of MOFs with graphene oxide (GO) or other carbon-based materials can improve their electrochemical performance due to the noticeable increase in electrical conductivity and the density of active sites.37–39 When explored as carbon sources, some of these MOF/GO composites allowed the preparation of high performance electrocatalysts.37,38 However, the weak interaction between MOF and GO added to the fast growth kinetics of the MOF, leading to very poorly controllable nanostructures among which are the inhomogeneous distributions on GO of MOF particles, and their very large crystal size (>50 nm).37,38,40–42 One of the most promising methods to bypass this difficulty is the use of sandwich-like nanosheets MOF/GO/MOF, in which the MOF crystals have to be small enough to be uniformly deposited with high density on the GO. Following this procedure, the ZIF-8/GO/ZIF-8 sandwich-like composite was recently synthesized with good performance to replace Pt for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, as ZIF-8 is made of zinc nodes and 2-methylimidazole ligands, ZIF-8/GO/ZIF-8 showed a lower catalytic activity.37,41–43 Therefore, the trend has been turned toward ZIF-67 crystal deposition on GO nanosheets, for the fabrication of sandwich-like ZIF-67/GO/ZIF-67 composites. Unfortunately, the direct deposition of ZIF-67 crystals on GO nanosheets via the direct growth route showed inhomogeneous distributions and large crystal size. A good method to solve this problem is the use of bimetallic ZIFs as structured MOFs, for the fabrication of GO/structured MOF composites.44–47 Very recently MOF-derived selenides have made remarkable progress in electrocatalysis and supercapacitors with excellent electrochemical activity and stability.48–53 However, very few research studies report the use of MOF-derived selenides in DSSCs.54–57 Moreover, in most of these reports, MOF-derived selenides have been used as the carbon source for application as the counter electrode (CE) in DSSCs. In addition, their selenization processes were commonly performed via in situ calcination and selenization in a quartz tube oven. The reports exploring the direct use in the DSSCs of MOF-derived selenides, without further calcination are almost non-existent.57 Wu et al.57 investigated the direct use of MOF-derived selenides as CE materials for DSSCs. They compared a MOF-derived selenide (CoSe2-D) prepared using in situ selenization in a quartz tube oven, and another MOF-derived selenide (CoSe2-S) prepared using solvothermal selenization. They found that the structure of CoSe2-S presented excellent electrocatalytic activity similar to Pt CE, with porous nanoparticles, beneficial for the diffusion ability of I−/I3− redox couple.
In this work, we prepared a MOF-derived selenide by hydrothermal selenization of reduced graphene oxide/structured ZIF-8@ZIF-67 (rGO/ZIF-8@ZIF-67). The resulting compound was made of porous nanowires encapsulated in a carbon matrix (rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2), and holding a very high surface area (169.30 m2 g−1) and excellent electrochemical activity. We also prepared CEs by spin-coating different weight percentages (1, 3, and 5 wt%) of rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 powder in PEDOT:PSS solution for comparison. The electrochemical analysis revealed that the 3 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS composite CE exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity compared to Pt CE. Furthermore, DSSCs based on the 3 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS composite achieved a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.60%, compared to the PCE of the Pt CE based DSSC (7.14%) prepared under similar conditions. This work has demonstrated that the low-cost rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS composite is an excellent candidate to replace the Pt CE in DSSCs.
Results and discussion
Characterisation of the as prepared rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 composite and rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS CEs
The morphology of the as prepared CEs was carried out by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (Fig. 1). Fig. 1(e and f) shows that rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 is made of porous nanowires surrounded with amorphous particles. This is confirmed in Fig. 1(g and h) which presents the morphology of the 3 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS composite, also made of nanowires surrounded with amorphous particles. The FESEM cross-sectional images in Fig. S1 (ESI†) show that the coated films have good adhesion with FTO glass substrates, with average film thicknesses of 0.52 μm, 0.15 μm, and 3 μm respectively for Pt, PEDOT:PSS, and 3 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS composite films.

Fig. S2(a) (ESI†) exhibits a standard type-IV isotherm with a H3 hysteresis loop at a high relative pressure (Above P/P0 = 0.9), indicating the mesoporous characteristic of the rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 composite.58 Furthermore, the BET surface area of the rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 composite was calculated to be 169.30 m2 g−1 (Table S1, ESI†), which is higher than that of other ZnSe/CoSe2-C composites prepared via in situ calcination and selenization under an argon or nitrogen flow.59–61 Higher surface area means more catalytic active sites for the reduction of I3−. Moreover, Fig. S2(b) (ESI†) shows that the pore size diameters of rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 mostly range between 2 and 50 nm, which further confirms their mesoporous structure.
The detailed microstructure of the rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 is characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) technology. As depicted in Fig. 2, rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 is made of porous nanowires encapsulated with the carbon matrix. The EDS mapping Fig. S3(d–g) (ESI†) shows a uniform distribution of the Co, Se, and C components, but not for Zn over the entire structure. Indeed, during the selenization process, the Zn metal was phase-separated from other elements due to its lower melting point (419.5 °C) compared to Co metal (1495 °C), causing the separation of ZnSe in the composite.59 The lattice fringes of 0.20 nm and 0.29 nm observed in HRTEM (see Fig. 2(c, d, i and j)) can respectively be ascribed to the cubic ZnSe (220) and orthorhombic CoSe2 (101). Moreover, in the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) rings Fig. S3(a) (ESI†), rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 displays the polycrystalline nature of these porous nanowires. This SAED pattern further confirms the crystal structure of this material with the presence of (111) and (220) rings from cubic ZnSe, and (111) and (320) rings from orthorhombic CoSe2.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to explore the nature of chemical bonds and chemical states of rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2. The survey spectrum in Fig. S4(a) (ESI†) clearly shows the peaks of Zn 2p, Co 2p, Se 3d, C 1s and O 1s. The XPS spectrum of Zn 2p (Fig. S4(b), ESI†) exhibits two strong peaks located at 1044.13 eV and 1020.86 eV, corresponding, respectively, to the binding energy of Zn 2p1/2 and Zn 2p3/2. Both peaks are consistent with Zn2+ in the binding energy of Zn–Se.62 The XPS spectrum of Co 2p (Fig. S4(c), ESI†) is composed of two spin–orbit doublets and two shake-up satellites (denoted “Sat.”). The peak at 795.4 eV can be assigned to Co 2p1/2 with a shoulder at 801.3 eV (Sat.), while the peak at 779.4 eV can be ascribed to Co 2p3/2 with a shoulder at 784.4 eV (Sat.). Both peaks are consistent with the characteristics of Co2+ in CoSe2.63–65 The two weak peaks located at 792.7 eV and 773.4 eV correspond respectively to Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 of Co3+.57,66 However, the main valence state of Co is the divalent metal cation. The existence of Co3+ peaks in the Co 2p spectrum was due to the partial surface oxidation of rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 under air atmosphere.67,68 Moreover, the shake-up satellites at higher energy were formed by the antibonding orbital between Se and Co atoms.59 In Fig. S4(d) (ESI†), the XPS spectra of C 1s reveal peaks at 290 eV, 286.7 eV, 284.2 eV, 283.3 eV, and 281 eV corresponding to O–CO, C–O, C–C, CC, and C–metal (C–Zn/Co) bonding respectively.69–71 The peak corresponding to the CC bond exhibits quite high intensity, while the one associated with the CO bond presents low intensity. This indicates that graphitic carbon was formed during the selenization process.59 Fig. S4(e) (ESI†) displays two deconvoluted peaks at 54.7 eV and 53.6 eV, corresponding respectively to Se 3d3/2 and Se 3d5/2. Both peaks are consistent with the metal–Se interactions of CoSe2.72 Moreover, the broad peak located within 57–61 eV can be ascribed to Se–O bonding on the surface, and Co 3p.65,73
The Raman spectra of rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2, rGO, ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 were also investigated as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 exhibits different peaks amongst which, the peak at 173 cm−1 can be assigned to the Zn–O vibration band (Fig. S5(c), ESI†), and are due to the bonding between Zn(II), and the functional groups –OH and –COOH found in GO.74 The peaks located at 197 cm−1, 467 cm−1, 511 cm−1, 616 cm−1, and 678 cm−1 (Fig. S5(c), ESI†) are consistent with the F(3)2g, Eg, F(2)2g, F(1)2g and A1g Raman modes of Co3O4 respectively.75,76 The two strong peaks (Fig. S5(b), ESI†) at 1345 cm−1 and 1587 cm−1 can be ascribed respectively to the D-band (defects) and the G-band (ordered graphitic carbon), confirming the presence of carbon materials in rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2.77–79 In addition, the intensity ratio of the two bands (ID/IG) is 1.07 in rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2, which is lower than the value obtained for rGO (1.15). This suggests few defects and an increase of graphitization in rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 (Fig. S5(a) and (b), ESI†). Moreover, the small peak at 2705 cm−1 is consistent with the 2D band (second order zone boundary phonon) present in rGO Fig. S5(b) (ESI†). As for the sharp peak located at 663 cm−1, it can be related to the C–Se bond (Fig. S5(c), ESI†).80,81 Furthermore, this bond allows improving the structural stability and the electrochemical performance of rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2.81
Fig. S6 (ESI†) presents the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of ZIF-8, ZIF-67, rGO, rGO/ZIF-8@ZIF-67 and rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2. In Fig. S6(b) (ESI†) The sharp diffraction peaks located at 7.3°, 10.4°, 12.7°, 14.7°, 16.4° and 18° can be respectively ascribed to the (011), (002), (112), (022), (013) and (222) crystal planes of rGO/ZIF-8@ZIF-67.82 As for the strong peaks located at around 27.4° and 45.4°, they can be ascribed respectively to the (111) and (220) diffraction peaks of cubic ZnSe (JCPDS No. 01-070-0777). The diffraction peaks located at 28.9°, 30.8°, 34.5°, 35.9°, 37.2°, 44.1°, 47.8°, 50.3°, 53.7°, 55.4°, 57°,59.4°, 63.3° and 66° match very well with the (011), (101), (111), (120), (200), (121), (211), (002), (031), (221), (131), (310), (122) and (320) lattice planes of orthorhombic CoSe2 (JCPDS No. 00-053-0449). This indicates that CoSe2 with high purity was formed. Our XRD pattern confirms that rGO/ZIF-8@ZIF-67 was successfully modified via the selenization process.
Electrochemical measurements of the prepared CEs
Generally speaking, cyclic voltammetry (CV) allows evaluating the catalytic activity of CEs in DSSCs.83 Herein, we have used CV to assess the electrocatalytic capabilities of different CEs of Pt, PEDOT:PSS, rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2, 1 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS, 3 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS and 5 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS for triiodide ion reduction (see Fig. 3(a)). Two pairs of standard oxidation–reduction current density peaks are visible. These oxidation reduction peaks labelled respectively with (Ox1, Red1) in the low potential region attributed to the chemical reaction in eqn (1), and (Ox2, Red2) in the high potential region ascribed to the chemical reaction in eqn (2). I3− + 2e− ↔ 3I−(1) 3I2 + 2e− ↔ 2I3−(2)The oxidation–reduction peaks located at the low potential region generally have a strong influence on the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs. In addition, with regard to the function of the CE in DSSCs, the redox peaks located at a more negative potential are mostly used to analyse its electrocatalytic performance and correspond to the chemical reaction of eqn (1).84 Consequently, we carefully examined the peak to peak separation (ΔEpp) and the reduction peak current density (JRed1) located at the low potential region, to assess the catalytic activity of CEs. In Table 1 we summarized the main CV parameters for different CEs. The value of ΔEpp is connected to the kinetic redox ability of the CE to the I−/I3− redox couple. A small ΔEpp confirms the high electrocatalytic ability of the corresponding CEs.85 The values of ΔEpp show the trend of 5 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS (293 mV) < 1 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS (377 mV) < 3 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS (484 mV) < Pt (505 mV) < rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 (511 mV) < PEDOT:PSS (740 mV).

This trend displays the higher electrocatalytic activity of rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS composites which can be attributed to the high electrocatalytic activity of rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 and the superior electrical conductivity of PEDOT:PSS.86 In addition, the absolute values of the reduction peak current density (|JRed1|) show the trend of 5 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS (1.620 mA cm−2) > 3 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS (1.315 mA cm−2) > Pt (1.156 mA cm−2) > 1 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS (1.013 mA cm−2) > rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 (0.848 mA cm−2) > PEDOT:PSS (0.652 mA cm−2). These values suggest that rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS composites have a higher reduction ability which is quite consistent with the results of ΔEpp. Furthermore, it can be noticed from the trends of ΔEpp and |JRed1| that 5 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS and 3 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS show an optimum electrocatalytic performance compared to Pt.
Moreover, we investigated the ratio JOx/|JRed| for the low potential region. Indeed, this ratio gives information about the reversibility of the redox reaction which is very important for the catalytic activity.87,88 From Table 1 we can observe that the JOx1/|JRed1| ratios for 5 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS and 3 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS are respectively 1.031 and 1.046, which are very close to 1. These values are closer to 1 than Pt (1.044) for 5 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS (1.031), and quite similarly to Pt (1.044) for 3 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS (1.046) which indicates a more reversible reaction.89 However, despite the high |JRed1| of the 5 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS based CE, we observed during the test that this film can be easily peeled off. Therefore, the 3 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS based CE can be considered as the more stable and best choice for I3− reduction in DSSCs.
We also investigated the CV curves recorded at different scan rates: 10, 30, 50, 70, 100, 130, 150, 200, 250 and 300 for the 3 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS composite CE. We noticed that an increase in the scanning speed increases the anodic and cathodic peak current densities. Therefore, a direct connection between the peak current densities was discovered, and the square root of the scan rate is as shown in Fig. S7(a) and (b) (ESI†). This phenomenon indicates that no chemical reaction exists between the redox couples (I−/I3−) and the 3 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS CE.90 Furthermore, a direct connection shows that the cathodic/anodic reactions have restricted the diffusion of the flow of iodide species in the cell toward the CE. This is due to the diffusion layer that becomes smaller as the scanning speed as well as the electrochemical polarization increases, leading in a high overpotential and reduced reversibility.91
In addition, we also assessed in the CV analysis the electrochemical stability of 3 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS CE (Fig. S7(c) and (d), ESI†). Indeed, the electrochemical stability is a critical factor which can influence the potential application of the CE in DSSCs. Therefore, the 3 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS CE was subjected to consecutive CV measurements at the scan rate of 50 mV s−1. No obvious change was observed in the morphology, the peak current density and the peak to peak separation (ΔEpp) even after 20 cycles, demonstrating the electrochemical stability and the strong adhesion to the FTO glass substrate. In addition to the high surface area of the rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 composite, the stability and strong adhesion of 3 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS CE are favored by the binding properties of PEDOT:PSS, and the protective carbon matrix, preventing the porous rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 nanoparticles from excessive deformation after many cycles.
EIS were investigated to further study the electrocatalytic activity of our CEs. The EIS measurements for CEs were performed on symmetric dummy cells made of two identical CEs. The corresponding Nyquist plots (Fig. 3(b)) show that Pt and rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 based CEs display two semicircles, while PEDOT:PSS and rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS composites based CEs display three semicircles, which can be due to the porous nature of these materials.92 In the Nyquist plots, the intercept of the first semicircle with the horizontal axis corresponds to the series resistance (Rs), the first semicircle (high frequency region) refers to the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) and the capacitance of the CE/electrolyte interface,93 the middle semicircle (middle frequency region-present here only in PEDOT:PSS based CEs) is connected to the adsorption of the iodine and triiodide surface having large active areas; and the last semicircle (low frequency region) corresponds to the Nernst diffusion impedance of the tri-iodide/iodide redox couple within a thin layer in the electrolyte (W).94 The EIS data were obtained by fitting the Nyquist plots with equivalent circuits (Fig. S8(a) and (b), ESI†), and the corresponding parameters are listed in Table 1. According to Table 1 the Rs values of rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS CEs are very close to the one of Pt CE compared to those of rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 and PEDOT:PSS CEs. Moreover, Rct values show the trend of 5 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS (0.28 Ω) < Pt (0.73 Ω) < 3 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS (1.01 Ω) < 1 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS (4.56 Ω) < PEDOT:PSS (10.25 Ω) < rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 (323 Ω). It can be noticed that upon addition of rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 in PEDOT:PSS, the Rct values decrease gradually from 28.45 Ω for PEDOT:PSS to 0.28 Ω for 5 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS, much lower than 0.73 Ω obtained for Pt CE. A lower value of Rct leads to a faster electron transfer from the surface of the CE to the electrolyte, giving rise to less interfacial recombination.88 Therefore, it can be concluded that 5 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS and 3 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS based CEs could ease the charge transfer process and the redox species transport. Consequently, 5 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS and 3 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS hold the best catalytic activity among our CEs, confirming the results of the previous CV analysis.
Tafel polarization is a powerful tool used to assess the catalytic performance of CEs. Generally speaking, the Tafel polarization curve comprises three domains, namely the polarization domain (|V| < 120 mV), the Tafel domain (120 mV < |V| < 400 mV), and the diffusion domain (|V| > 400 mv).85 To assess the catalytic activity of CEs for I3−, the Tafel and diffusion domains can be studied. Indeed, the two key parameters such as the exchange current density (J0) and the limiting diffusion current density (Jlim) are closely connected to the catalytic ability of the samples,95–97 and can be extracted from the Tafel and diffusion domains respectively (see Fig. 3(c)). Furthermore, J0 and Jlim can also be calculated using eqn (3) and (4) (3) (4)where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, F is the Faraday constant, n is the number of electron transferred per chemical reaction between the electrolyte and the CE interface (n = 2), Dn is the diffusion coefficient of I3−, l is the thickness of the diffusion layer and C is the concentration of I3−. Moreover, Dn can also be obtained using the Randles–Sevcik theory98 (eqn (5)) in which Jred is the peak current density, K = 2.69 × 105, A the active area of the symmetric cell, and ν the applied scan rate for the CV curves. Jred = Kn1.5ACDn0.5ν0.5(5)We can observe from Table 1, a significant increase in the J0 values upon addition of rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 to PEDOT:PSS. These values increase from 0.17 mA cm−2 and 0.32 mA cm−2 respectively for PEDOT:PSS and rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2, to 10.23 mA cm−2 and 11.75 mA cm−2 respectively for 3 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS and 5 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS, both of which are much higher than the J0 value of 9.55 mA cm−2 achieved for Pt CE. Furthermore, the slight increase observed in the J0 value from 3 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS (10.23 mA cm−2) to 5 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS (11.75 mA cm−2) indicates that the 3 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS is the optimum composite for the catalytic reduction of I3−, as mentioned in the previous CV analysis. Moreover, we can notice in Table 1 the calculated Dn values following the decreasing order 5 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS (9.07 × 10−7 cm−2 s−1) > 3 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS (5.97 × 10−7 cm−2 s−1) > Pt (4.62 × 10−7 cm−2 s−1) > 1 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS (3.55 × 10−7 cm−2 s−1) > rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 (2.48 × 10−7 cm−2 s−1) > PEDOT:PSS (1.47 × 10−7 cm−2 s−1). The high Dn values of 5 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS (9.07 × 10−7 cm−2 s−1) and 3 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS (5.97 × 10−7 cm−2 s−1) among our CEs denotes their high velocity which is of great benefit for improving the photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs.
The photovoltaic parameters of DSSCs made of different CEs are recorded in Table 2, and the corresponding J–V curves are displayed in Fig. 3(d). It can be noticed that when used directly as the CE for a DSSC, rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 allowed the achievement of a promising PCE of 5.58% compared to the Pt-based DSSC of 7.14% prepared under the same conditions. This value was significantly improved by preparing rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS composites. Indeed, when increasing the weight percentage of rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 in the rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS composite, the PCE of DSSCs increases considerably up to 8.60% and 7.79% respectively for 3 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS and 5 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS. Both these values are much higher than that of the Pt-based DSSC (7.14%) counterpart thanks to the higher Jsc and FF, resulting mainly from the achievement of higher electrocatalytic activity in both composites. The high electrocatalytic activity and excellent performances are favored by the synergistic effects between porous rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 having superior surface area (169.30 m2 g−1), and PEDOT:PSS which holds a high conductivity and strong binding capability with the FTO glass substrate. This contributes to the lower Rct and the lower diffusion resistance of both CEs, in good agreement with the above mentioned morphological and electrochemical analysis. However, the decrease in PCE noticed in the 5 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS composite based DSSC can be due to the agglomeration of rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 particles in the composite leading to a reduced performance.

Preparation of rGO/ZIF-8@ZIF-67
GO/structured ZIF-8@ZIF-67 was synthesized via a ZIF-8 seed-mediated approach with a slight modification of the procedures reported in previous literature studies.37,82,99 In brief, the first step consisted of the preparation of rGO/ZIF-8 by deposition of ZIF-8 seeds on GO. Typically, a methanolic solution of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (4.545 g, 20 mL) and a methanolic solution of MeIm (6.818 g, 20 mL) were mixed under stirring. Then, 20 mL of GO solution (5 mg mL−1, in water/methanol, 1:4, v/v) was added to the above mixture. After stirring for 30 minutes, the mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 100 °C for 12 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the grey solid formed was collected by centrifugation (8000 rpm, 10 min), and washed at least 3 times with methanol. After drying at 80 °C for 12 h, rGO/ZIF-8 was prepared. The second step consisted of deposition of ZIF-67 onto rGO/ZIF-8. Typically, methanolic solutions of rGO/ZIF-8 (1.004 g, 20 mL), cobalt chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2·6H2O) (2.209 g, 20 mL) and MeIm (11.248 g, 20 mL) were mixed under stirring. After stirring for 30 minutes, the mixture was kept for reaction at room temperature for 12 h. The product was collected by centrifugation (8000 rpm, 10 min), and washed at least 3 times with methanol. After drying at 80 °C for 12 h, rGO/ZIF-8@ZIF-67 was obtained.
Selenization of rGO/ZIF-8@ZIF-67
The selenization of rGO/ZIF-8@ZIF-67 was performed with a slight modification of simple hydrothermal synthesis of CoSe2 reported in previous literature.100 First, a selenium (Se) precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 4 g of NaOH in 30 mL of deionized water (DI water), followed by the addition of selenium powder Se (0.1895 g), which was completely dissolved by heating the mixture at 80 °C. Secondly, a rGO/ZIF-8@ZIF-67 precursor solution was prepared by dissolving (0.4754 g) rGO/ZIF-8@ZIF-67 powder in 10 mL of disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate dihydrate (EDTA–2Na) aqueous (aq.) solution (80 mM). After heating the rGO/ZIF-8@ZIF-67 precursor solution and the Se precursor solution at the same temperature, both solutions were mixed under constant stirring and heating for 10 min on a hot plate. Then, the homogenous solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave, and kept at 170 °C for 12 h. After cooling at room temperature, the black precipitate was collected by centrifugation (8000 rpm, 10 min), and washed at least 3 times with water and ethanol. After drying at 60 °C for 12 h, rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 was obtained. Scheme 1 presents in summary the steps for the synthesis of rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2.
 Scheme 1  Schematic diagram for the synthesis of rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2. 
Preparation of counter electrodes
For the preparation of rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 CEs, rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 powder was dispersed in γ-butyrolactone (GBL) at 2 mg mL−1 concentration. Then, the dispersion was drop-cast onto FTO glass substrates and dried at 120 °C for 20 min on a heating plate. After drying, the substrate was heated again at 200 °C for 30 min. For the preparation of rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS composite CEs, we dispersed (1, 3 and 5 wt%) rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 powder into PEDOT:PSS solution, added 6% of EG, then the mixture was successively ultrasonicated and stirred for 2 h. All rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS composite CEs were spin-coated onto FTO glass (2000 rpm/30 s) then dried at 80 °C for 1 h. PEDOT:PSS CEs were also prepared by spin coating PEDOT:PSS solution onto FTO glass then dried at 80 °C for 1 h. For comparison, we also prepared Pt CEs by thermal decomposition of H2PtCl6 10 mM in ethanol at 380 °C.101 Then, the Pt solution was drop-cast onto FTO glass and heated at 400 °C for 20 min.
Fabrication of photoanode and full DSSCs
The TiO2 paste was prepared according to a previous report.102 Under an ultrasonic bath and for 15 min each time, we successively washed and rinsed FTO glass substrates with water-detergent solution, deionized water and ethanol. After drying, the FTO glass was immersed in a 20 mM TiCl4 (aq.) bath at 70 °C for 30 min, then successively rinsed in deionized water and ethanol. This was followed by the coating of a commercial TiO2 paste onto the TiCl4 pre-treated FTO glass using a screen-printing technique. Our working electrodes consisted of 5 layers of a transparent TiO2 paste (18 nm), screen-printed on the conductive side of the TiCl4 pre-treated FTO glass. On top of the transparent TiO2 layers, 3 layers of scattering TiO2 paste (400 nm) were screen-printed. The printing of each layer of TiO2 paste (transparent and scattering) was followed by annealing the electrode at 120 °C for 10 min each time. The resulting TiO2 films having an active area of 0.16 cm2 were gradually sintered under airflow in oven system, at 325 °C for 5 min, at 375 °C for 5 min, at 450 °C for 15 min, and finally, at 500 °C for 30 min, and allowed to cool in air. After cooling at room temperature, the nanocrystalline TiO2 electrode was TiCl4 post-treated in a 20 mM TiCl4 (aq.) bath at 70 °C for 30 min, then successively rinsed in deionized water and ethanol. Prior to sensitization, the TiO2 electrode was heated at 500 °C for 30 min, cooled, then immersed for 24 h in a 0.3 mM N719 dye solution (mixture of 1:1 V/V acetonitrile and tert-butanol solvents). We assembled the DSSCs by clipping the dye loaded TiO2 photoanode onto a platinized FTO glass counter electrode, using a 25 μm thick spacer (Solaronix) having an inner dimension of 5 × 6 mm. Then we injected the liquid electrolyte into the gap between the electrodes.
Characterization and measurements
The surface morphologies of our CEs were investigated using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JSM 7100F, JEOL), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL) equipped with an EDS system. The surface area and pore size distribution of the rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 composite powder were investigated via N2 gas adsorption/desorption method using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) models on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 HD88 system. The XRD profiles of our compounds were recorded on an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8 advance) using monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm), and the Raman spectra was recorded on a LabRAM, Aramis Raman spectrometer using an Ar-ion laser of 532 nm. The XPS measurements, were performed on a VG Multi-Lab 2000 spectrometer at a base pressure of <10−9 Torr. For the electrochemical analysis we first performed CV using a CHI760D electrochemical workstation. The samples were measured in a three-electrode electrochemical system, made of Ag/Ag+ (10 mM AgNO3 in acetonitrile) as a reference electrode, Pt wire as a counter electrode, and our prepared CEs as working electrodes, in acetonitrile electrolyte composed of 0.1 M LiClO4·3H2O, 10 mM LiI, and 1 mM I2. The measurements were performed at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1, in the potential range of ±1.0 V. Then, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed using a CHI760D electrochemical workstation. The samples consisted of symmetric dummy cells made of two identical CEs and the liquid electrode (CE/electrolyte/CE). EIS was performed under dark conditions at 0 V bias voltage with a perturbation amplitude of 5 mV. The frequency was controlled from 100 mHz to 100 kHz. The resulting impedance spectra were investigated and fitted using Z-view software applying the related equivalent circuits as a model. We also recorded the Tafel polarization plots of the symmetric cells on the CHI760D electrochemical workstation at 10 mV s−1 scan rate. The photocurrent density voltage (J–V) curves of the assembled DSSCs, were recorded using the Newport solar simulator, USA (450 W Xe source) equipped with a Keithley 2400 source meter under irradiation (AM 1.5G, 0.1 W cm−2, light radiation intensity). The corresponding light intensity was calibrated using the standard Si solar cell.
Conclusions
Porous rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 and its rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS composites were successfully prepared and investigated for the first time as CEs for DSSCs. Porous rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 were synthesized using a simple hydrothermal method. The electrochemical analysis proved that 3 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS and 5 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS CEs exhibit higher electrocatalytic activity than Pt CE. Moreover, the DSSCs prepared using 3 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS and 5 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS CEs achieved superior PCEs of 8.60% and 7.79% respectively compared to the corresponding Pt-based DSSC (7.14%) prepared under similar conditions. These impressive achievements are the results of the high surface area (169.30 m2 g−1) of porous rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2, combined with PEDOT:PSS having superior conductivity and strong binding capability with the FTO glass substrate. These synergistic effects also contribute to the stability and strong adhesion observed with 3 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS CE, and representing an important factor for the potential application of this CE in DSSCs. Consequently, the DSSC based on 3 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS CE can be considered as the one showing the optimum performance in DSSCs. This work has demonstrated a new strategy to prepare without any calcination, efficient CEs of porous rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2–PEDOT:PSS composites with better performance compared to the Pt CE in DSSCs.
