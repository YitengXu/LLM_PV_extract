NDF was used as the electron donor unit in constructing a new low band gap copolymer (PNDFDTBT). A polymer solar cell with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PNDFDTBT:PC71BM (1:2,w/w)/Ca/Al demonstrates a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.5%.
In recent years, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted broad attention due to their unique features such as cost effectiveness, roll to roll processing and lightweight properties.1–3 Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) type PSCs are the most widely utilized device architecture, comprising of a photoactive blend layer of a conjugated polymer donor and a soluble fullerene derivative acceptor sandwiched between an indium-tin oxide (ITO) positive electrode and a low work function metal negative electrode.4,5 Intensive research on the molecular design and device optimization have led to a rapid development in the field of PSCs over the past decade.6,7 However, up to date, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability still need to be improved for commercial applications.8
The design and synthesis of new polymer materials with ideal properties is one important strategy for high PCEs. It has been demonstrated that an ideal polymer donor should have a broad absorption spectra, a deep HOMO level and high hole mobility. The donor–acceptor (D–A) approach has been proved to be one of the most efficient strategies for obtaining low band gap polymers and modulating their electronic properties.9 The most efficient donor materials reported to date are copolymers incorporating the well-investigated benzodithiophene (BDT) moiety.10,11 Most recently, Hou et al. and our group reported its counterpart benzodifuran and its polymers exhibiting high photovoltaic properties.12–15 Excepting the applications of these existing donors such as cyclopentadithiophene, dithienosilole, etc, it remains still a great challenge to explore D–A copolymers with new donor or acceptor structures to gain a deeper understanding of the structure-property relationships and improve the performance. During the process of our developing BDF based photovoltaic polymers, a new electron donor unit- naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]difuran (NDF) intrigued our great interest due to the π extended conjugation system enhancing the π–π stacking and larger delocalization effect compared to the BDF unit.16 From the reported works, NDF derivatives have received very little attention.17 Up to now, derivatives of its sulfur counterpart naphthodithiophene (NDT) have been synthesized as the electron donor unit and their corresponding D–A molecules or copolymers have been used in PSCs very recently. For example, Osaka and co-workers reported a polymer, PNDT3NTz-DT, which shows a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.9% with a hole mobility of 0.54 cm2 V−1 s−1.18 Tobin J. Marks et al. synthesized two NDT based small molecule photovoltaic materials, namely NDT(TDPP)2 and zNDT(TDPP)2, while blended with PC61BM exhibiting a PCE up to 4.1% and 4.7%, respectively.19,20 In parallel, NDF derivatives have been used in FETs showing a higher hole mobility of 3.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 than its sulfur counterpart, which is originated from dense crystal packing and large intermolecular orbital overlap as well as small reorganization energy from the small radius of an oxygen atom.16 Although NDF small molecules have been used in high performance FETs, NDF-based polymers are completely missing from the chemists' toolbox.
Based on the above considerations, the development and synthesis of new NDF derivatives and their related copolymers seems highly desirable due to π extended conjugation system and high hole mobility, which can probably afford some unique features for photovoltaic applications.16 Here, we synthesized a new NDF derivative, naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]difuran ditin using a simple three-step synthetic route for the first time, with alkyl chains attaching into the furan unit, to improve the solubility of the highly rigid planar backbone in the NDF-based polymers. 4,7-Dithienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT) was chosen as an electron withdrawing building block. PNDFDTBT exhibited good absorption, appropriate energy levels and high hole mobility. The PNDFDTBT:PC71BM (1:2, w/w) blend showed a high mobility up to 7.4 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1. The PSCs based on a PNDFDTBT and PC71BM blend showed a high PCE of 4.5% with a short circuit current (Jsc) of 9.96 mA cm−2 under the illumination of AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2.
The successful synthetic routes of the co-monomer and PNDFDTBT are shown in Scheme 1. Starting from commercially available 1,5-dihydroxynaphthalene, reacted with 2 equiv. of 1-bromo-undecan-2-one with potassium carbonate in CH3CN under reflux for 4 h, produced the intermediate alkyl naphthalene 1,5-diehter (1) in good yield. The compound 2 substituted with two nonyl groups on the furan units was obtained by refluxing anhydrous methanesulfonic acid in hot methylene chloride in fair yield. M1 can be obtained adding n-butyllithium and trimethyltin chloride into the compound 2 in THF, which was then recrystallized from isopropanol to give yellow needles. PNDFDTBT was synthesized from M1 and M2 using a typical Stille coupling polymerization reaction. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) results have shown that the polymer has a number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 9.5 kDa mol−1 with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.91. TGA analysis reveals that, under the protection of an inert atmosphere, the onset point of the 5% weight loss of PNDFDTBT is ca. 325 °C (see Fig. S2†).

Fig. 1 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the PNDFDTBT solution and film. In the solution state, PNDFDTBT shows two absorption peaks at ca. 409 nm and ca. 559 nm. The peak of 409 nm belongs to the π–π* transition of the main chain units, and the 559 nm peak could be attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) absorption of the conjugated polymer backbone. In the film state, the absorption of the polymer film in the visible region got broadened, more red-shifted in comparison with that of the polymer solution, the maximum absorption peak redshifted to 570 nm, because of the aggregation and stronger inter-chain interactions between the conjugated main chains of PNDFDTBT.21 The absorption edge of the PNDFDTBT film is at ca. 711 nm, corresponding to an optical bandgap of 1.74 eV.

The electrochemical behavior of PNDFDTBT was measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the results were shown in Fig. S3†. The HOMO and LUMO levels were estimated from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials assuming the absolute energy level of ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) to be 4.8 eV below vacuum.22 The onset oxidation and reduction potentials are 0.87 V and −0.90 V, respectively. The HOMO and LUMO levels of PNDFDTBT are estimated to be −5.27 eV and −3.50 eV. The electrochemical bandgap of the PNDFDTBT estimated from the HOMO and LUMO energy levels is 1.77 eV.
We measured the hole mobility of PNDFDTBT blended with PC71BM by SCLC method, which is based on Poole-Frenkel Law with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PNDFDTBT: PC71BM(1:2, w/w)/Au.23 The average hole mobility of the blends of PNDFDTBT and PC71BM is 7.4 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 among ten devices (see Fig. S4†). The hole mobility of PNDFDTBT is even higher than PBDFDODTBT under the same conditions.14 The improved hole mobility of PNDFDTBT should be the result of the larger extended planar structure and stronger π–π stacking, which facilitate the charge transport. To further verify this result, we measured the typical field effect transistors (FETs) of PNDFDTBT, the polymer PNDFDTBT shows a comparable FET hole mobility of 1.3 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. S5†) with a low threshold voltage of 1.6 V.
The photovoltaic properties of PNDFDTBT were measured with a device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PNDFDTBT: PCBM/Ca/Al. Detailed fabrication and characterization are shown in the Experimental section. Fig. S6a† shows the typical current density versus voltage (J–V) curves of the device, the detailed photovoltaic results are summarized in Table S1.† The blends of PNDFDTBT and PCBM at different weight ratios (1:1, 1:2, 1:3) were used to optimize the device performances. The optimized polymer to PCBM ratio is 1:2. As shown in Fig. 2a, when PNDFDTBT and PC61BM were in the weight ratio of 1:2, the best PCE of 3.2% was obtained with a Voc of 0.73 V, Jsc of 7.15 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.60. In order to achieve a better PCE of the device, we replaced PC61BM using PC71BM to improve the Jsc of the device because PC71BM has better absorption than that of PC61BM with a similar energy level.24 Compared with PC61BM as the acceptor, using PNDFDTBT and PC71BM with a weight ratio of 1:2, the highest PCE of 4.5% with a Voc of 0.73 V, a Jsc of 9.96 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.62 was obtained (Table 1). When the weight ratio of PNDFDTBT and PC71BM was changed to 1:3, the efficiency decreased to 3.81% because of the reduction of Jsc and FF. Voc of the devices is kept almost stable above 0.7 V with different weight ratios of PNDFDTBT and PCBM. The accuracy of the photovoltaic measurements can be confirmed by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the device. Fig. 2b shows the EQE plots of the PSC devices fabricated under the same conditions as those for the J–V measurements with PNDFDTBT: PCBM of a 1:2 weight ratio. It can be seen that the devices showed a broad response over the range of 300–700 nm. The higher values of EQE are consistent with the higher Jsc measured in the solar cells. The Jsc values obtained from integrating the EQE curves with the AM 1.5G reference spectrum and from J–V measurements are very close. The EQE results indicate the accuracy of the photovoltaic measurements. For the PNDFDTBT:PC71BM (1:2, w/w) blend, the EQE values are above 40% between 350 nm to 600 nm, integrating Jsc from EQE gives ca.10 mA cm−2. The maximum EQE value reaches 75% when the wavelength is 486 nm.

We investigated the morphologies of PNDFDTBT:PC71BM (1:2, w/w) blend films spin-coated from their o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) solution by using tapping-mode atomic-force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). From the height image in Fig. S7a†, the root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness value of the blend films for PNDFDTBT is 0.66 nm, relatively homogeneous and smooth surfaces with very little aggregation were observed, which may be compact chain packing and crystallization in an aggregation form beneficial for obtaining high hole mobility. As shown in the corresponding phase image, pronounced nanophase separation and homogeneous morphology were formed, which to some extent explains the high photovoltaic properties of the PNDFDTBT:PC71BM blend. Fig. S7c† shows the TEM image of PNDFDTBT:PC71BM blend films prepared using the same conditions as those for the formation of the active layers. The dark regions were PCBM-rich domains, while bright regions were polymer-rich distributions. From the TEM image, the fine, nanoscale phase separation and nanofibers can be shown more clearly, implying that long and well connected pathways have been formed, which is beneficial to high photovoltaic performance.
In conclusion, a new naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]difuran (NDF) containing donor–acceptor polymer (PNDFDTBT) has been synthesized and applied in PSCs for the first time. The polymer possesses good thermal stability, broad absorption and low-lying HOMO energy levels. The hole mobility of the blend reached up to 7.4 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s by SCLC method. A PCE of 4.5% from a PNDFDTBT based polymer solar cell was obtained. The preliminary work shows that the NDF derivative with alkyl chains has been synthesized firstly using the simple two-step synthetic route, and more importantly, the investigations also indicate that NDF and related derivatives can be efficiently utilized to control the optical and electronic properties of conjugated polymers and may therefore become a simple and promising building block for the future design of optoelectronic polymers.
