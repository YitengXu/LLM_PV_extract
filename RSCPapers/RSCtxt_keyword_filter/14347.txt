    , Accepted 19th December 2011First published on 20th December 2011AbstractThe rigidification of π-conjugated segments represents a feasible tactic towards energy-level engineering of organic D-π-A dyes in mesoscopic titania solar cells. In this work, comparions of four dyes with the di(3-hexylthiophene), dihexyldithienosilole, dihexylcyclopentadithiophene and N-hexyldithienopyrrole linkers have revealed some general influences of π-linker rigidification on the optoelectronic features of titania solar cells employing a cobalt(II/III) redox electrolyte, in terms of energetic and kinetic viewpoints. Compared to a dye with the di(3-hexylthiophene) linker, its three counterparts with rigidified dithiophene blocks present bathochromic and hyperchromic absorptions of solar photons. Transient absorption measurements have shown that the incorporation of Si-, C- and N-bridged dithiophene segments decelerates the dye regeneration kinetics. The rigidification of π-conjugated dithiophene linkers brings forth a general open-circuit photovoltage diminishment, in the range from 60 to 190 mV. Further insightful impedance analyses have disclosed that the open-circuit photovoltage reduction, due to the π-linker alternation from di(3-hexylthiophene) to N-hexyldithienopyrrole, is predominantly caused by an adverse downward displacement of the titania conduction band edge, despite a positive contribution from attenuated charge recombination at the titania/electrolyte interface.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) technology1 is under intense investigation owing to its relatively efficient conversion of sunlight to electricity, while its key active materials and device processing remain cost-effective in comparison with those of conventional inorganic semiconductor photovoltaics. In a typical DSC, a photosensitizer plays a crucial role in photogeneration of charge carrriers. Elaborate engineering of some ruthenium polypyridine2 and zinc porphyrin3 complexes as well as metal-free organic dyes4 has greatly impelled the efficiency progress of this cutting-edge photovoltaic technology. In this regard, of particular interest is the design of organic D-π-A dyes primarily owing to both raw materials abundance and good synthetic yields.
Key developments on D-π-A dyes have involved (i) reducing molecular energy gap (ΔE) to enhance an overlap between the electronic absorption spectrum of a dye and the standard solar emission spectrum for a high photocurrent and (ii) tuning steric and/or electronic structures of a dye to modulate the physicochemical characteristics of the titania/dye/electrolyte interface for a reasonable open-circuit photovoltage. Amongst the various strategies to narrow down ΔE of a DSC, one common tactic is the π-conjugation extension.5 A second way lies in the rigidification of conjugated linkers via covalent immobilization of adjacent 5- or 6-member aromatic rings,6 suppressing the rotational disorder of molecules and enhancing the delocalization capacity of π-electrons, leading to a smaller ΔE. Moreover, it is valuable to note that selection of fastening atoms, such as C, Si and N, can notably impact both the electronic traits of semiconducting polymers, tuning the performance of organic optoelectronic devices based thereon.7
In this paper, by employing a triphenylamine-cyanoacrylic acid dye containing a di(3-hexylthiophene) π-linker and its three analogues where dihexyldithienosilole, dihexylcyclopentadithiophene and N-hexyldithienopyrrole were incorporated as the respective π-linkers, we investigate some general influences of the selection of fastening atoms (Si, C and N) for π-linker rigidification upon charge photogeneration as well as photovoltage of DSCs using a tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt(II/III) redox shuttle. Quantum calculations show that the rigidification of dithiophene linkers can noticeably tune molecular energy-level alignments and orbital distributions. Moreover, the rigidification with different atoms such as Si, C and N is also found to affect the surface coverage and thereby packing mode of dyes grafted on titania, offering the opportunity to tune the physicochemical properties of the titania/dye/electrolyte interface and thereby modulate the photovoltaic parameters of dye-sensitized solar cells.

General dye synthesis. 
Piperidine (7.0 equiv.) was added to a stirred solution of an aldehyde precursor (1.0 equiv.) and cyanoacetic acid (3.0 equiv.) in chloroform. The reaction mixture was refluxed under argon for 14 h and then acidified with 2 M hydrochloric acid aqueous solution. The crude product was extracted into chloroform, washed with water and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After evaporation of solvent under reduced pressure, the residue was purified by flash chromatography with toluene and methanol/toluene (1/10, v/v) in turn as eluents to yield a powder.

2. Computational details
The ground state geometries were optimized in gas phase employing the hybrid B3LYP function9 and a 6-31G* basis set. Vertical excitation energies were calculated by TD-DFT at both MPW1K10/6-31G* and CAM-B3LYP11/6-31G* levels of theory. The effect of the solvent (acetonitrile) on the absorption spectra has been simulated by the C-PCM method.12 On the basis of neutral and oxidized dye equilibrium geometries, we further calculated the reorganization energy (λreg) for the dye regeneration reaction. All the calculations were carried out with Gaussian 0313 and Gaussian 0914 program packages.
3. Electronic absorption and voltammetric measurements
An Agilent G1103A spectrometer was employed to record electronic absorption spectra. Transient absorption measurements were carried out on a LP920 laser flash spectrometer, with a pump pulse from a nanosecond wavelength tunable OPOLett-355II laser. The sample was kept at a 45° angle with respect to the excitation beam. Transient absorption spectra were recorded with an Andor ICCD camera using a xenon arc lamp as probe light. In our kinetic experiments, the probe light was first passed through a bandpass filter (center wavelength: 782 nm), detected by a fast photomultiplier tube and recorded with a TDS 3012C digital signal analyzer. The excitation wavelengths and pulse fluences were carefully controlled to ensure that ∼7.6 × 1013 photons cm−2 were absorbed by dye-coated films immersed in different electrolytes during every laser pulse. Note that the pump wavelengths were chosen according to the optical density of ∼0.2 for dye-coated mesoscopic titania films, guaranteeing comparable electron distribution profiles in different samples. Square-wave voltammograms of dye-coated titania films were measured on a CHI660C electrochemical workstation, using a Pt gauze counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl) auxiliary electrode.
4. Cell fabrication and photovoltaic characterizations
On a pre-cleaned FTO glass, a 2.1 μm-thick transparent layer of 23 nm-sized TiO2 particles was first screen-printed and further coated with a 2.7 μm-thick second layer of scattering titania particles, producing a bilayer titania film which was used later as the negative electrode of DSCs. The film thickness was monitored with a bench-top Ambios XP-1 stylus profilometer. A titania electrode (∼0.28 cm2) was stained by immersing it into a dye solution of 150 μM dye (C239, C240, C218 or C241) dissolved in a mixed solvent of acetonitrile/tert-butanol (v/v, 1/1) for 5 h. The dye-coated titania electrode was rinsed with acetonitrile and dried by air flow, and further assembled with a thermally platinized FTO positive electrode using a 25 μm-thick Surlyn (DuPont) hot-melt gasket. The internal space was perfused with an electrolyte with the aid of a vacuum-back-filling system. The cobalt electrolyte used here is composed of 250 mM tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt(II) di(tetracyanoborate), 50 mM tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt(III) tri(tetracyanoborate), 500 mM TBP and 100 mM LiTFSI in acetonitrile. Details on photovoltaic measurements can be found in our previous publication.5i
5. Impedance spectroscopy measurements
Impedance spectroscopies were recorded with an IM6ex electrochemical workstation, with a frequency range from 50 mHz to 100 kHz and a potential modulation of 20 mV. A white-light-emitting diode (LED) was used to supply an equivalent one sun irradiation on a testing cell, to which a metal mask (aperture area: ∼0.158 cm2) was adhered. The obtained impedance spectra were fitted with the Z-view software (v2.80, Scribner Associates Inc.) in terms of an appropriate equivalent circuit. The potential bias V was calibrated through subtracting the IR drop caused by the series resistance from the applied potential bias.
Results and discussion
To preliminarily evaluate the impact of rigidification of dithiophene via the Si, C or N fastening atom on light harvesting capacity, we first recorded the electronic absorption spectra (Fig. 2A) of dyes dissolved in acetonitrile and tert-butanol. From the data collected in Table 1, it can be noticed that with respect to the di(3-hexylthiophene)-containing C239 dye, its three counterparts with rigidified π-linkers present notably red-shifts of the maximum visible absorption wavelength (λsolmax) by 82–88 nm and over five times enhancement of the maximum molar visible-absorption coefficient (εsolmax). Moreover, alteration of the bridging atom from Si (C240) to C (C218) and N (C241) elevates εsolmax from 48.2 × 103 to 58.9 × 103 and 68.0 × 103 M−1 cm−1. As shown by the calculated λmax and oscillator strengths (f) in Table 2, TD-DFT calculations nicely reproduce the measured red-shifts and the increased absorption coefficients on going from C239 to C240, C218 and C241.

Fig. 2B shows the electronic absorption spectra of dye-coated titania films soaked in our cobalt electrolyte for cell fabrication. Apparently, a comparison of the maximum absorption coefficients (αfilmmax) of these stained titania films generally follows the trend of εsolmax of dye solutions, although there is a hypochromic effect of these dyes anchored on titania nanocrystals compared to their solutions, which can be partially due to a relatively weaker electron-withdrawing ability of the carboxylate-titanium assembly compared to the carboxylic-acid group.
To better understand the capability of a molecule to absorb a photon at a particular wavelength and polarization, we calculated the absorption cross-section (σ) of these dye molecules via σ = α/N, where α is the absorption coefficient (cm−1) and N is the molecular density (cm−3). In combination with the surface coverage (Γ) of these dyes (Table 1) anchored on titania nanocrystals, we can obtain the maximum molecular visible-absorption cross-sections (σfilmmax) of dyes grafted on titania, being 5.5 × 10−17 (C239), 7.5 × 10−17 (C240), 10.2 × 10−17 (C218) and 13.7 × 10−17 cm2 (C241), which display the same trend as that of maximum molecular visible-absorption cross-sections (σsolmax) in solution (Table 1). Furthermore, it is highly interesting to notice the considerable diminishment of molecular absorption cross-sections in the course of chemisorption of rigidified cyanoacrylic dyes from solution to titania. This finding has an important implication in further dye design and we need to consider other innovative strategies. Overall, a dye molecule with a high absorption cross-section on titania is of beneficial effect for DSCs with bulky cobalt redox mediators, where a very thin titania film is required to avoid the mass transport limitation of cobalt(III) ions. We notice that the distorted molecular structure of C239 and hence its larger effective volume upon adsorption onto titania, gives a reason for the small coverage value measured.
To determine the spectroscopic profiles of the oxidized dye molecules, we recorded the transient absorption difference spectra of 2.1 μm-thick dye-coated titania films permeated with an inert electrolyte consisting of 0.5 M TBP and 0.1 M LiTFSI in acetonitrile. In marked contrast to the steady-state electronic spectra (Fig. 2B), strong absorptions (Fig. 3) in the near-infrared region arise for all dyes upon pulsed laser excitation. With the aid of the spectroelectrochemical measurements (Fig. S1†) on dye-coated titania films immersed in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide, we can unambiguously ascribe the positive signals in the transient absorption spectra to the electronic absorption of oxidized dyes. Charge-transfer dynamics of the reactions of oxidized dye molecules with electron donors in our cells were further measured to examine some possible influence of the π-linker variation upon photogeneration of carriers.15–17 A probe light at 782 nm was chosen in our kinetic measurements with a photomultiplier tube. The slow charge recombination (traces a–d in Fig. 3) between injected electrons in titania and oxidized dye molecules was recorded with cells fabricated with the aforementioned inert electrolyte and 11 μm-thick, dye-coated titania films. The absorption decays were fitted to a stretched exponential function ΔA ∝ A0exp[−(t/τ)α], where A0 is a pre-exponential factor, α is the stretching parameter and τ is the characteristic time. Using the gamma function Γ(x), the average time (<τ>bet) of this charge recombination reaction was calculated through <τ> = (τ/α)Γ(1/α).18 It is found that C239 exhibits a long <τ>bet of 2.7 ms, while C240, C218 and C241 with Si-, C- and N-rigidified dithiophene π-linkers have a slight but general acceleration of back electron transfer from titania to oxidized dye molecules, with the <τ>bet values being 1.9, 2.0 and 1.7 ms, respectively.

Laser pulse fluence and excitation wavelength: a, 54 μJ cm−2 at 586 nm; b, 48 μJ cm−2 at 662 nm; c, 47 μJ cm−2 at 666 nm; d, 49 μJ cm−2 at 657 nm; e, 53 μJ cm−2 at 595 nm; f, 48 μJ cm−2 at 672 nm; g, 46 μJ cm−2 at 675 nm; h, 48 μJ cm−2 at 667 nm. Smooth lines are stretched exponential fittings over raw data obtained by averaging 500 laser shots. 
We recall that since the recombination between injected electrons and oxidized dyes essentially follows non-adiabatic dynamics, the reaction rate exponentially decays with increasing the spatial separation between the electrons in titania and the holes localized on the oxidized dyes, which can be assimilated to the HOMO of the neutral dye.19,20 As shown in Fig. 4, the introduction of Si-, C- and N-rigidifying π-linkers in C240, C218 and C241, yields a substantial delocalization of the HOMOs, which, albeit is maximally localized on the donor moiety, further extends to the anchoring group. This spatial delocalization of the HOMOs effectively shifts the hole on dye cations closer to the TiO2 surface for the planar C240, C218 and C241 dyes than that of the non-planar C239 dye, where the HOMO is essentially localized on the donor (Fig. 4). The larger HOMO/TiO2 spatial separation thus possibly accounts for the slower recombination rate measured for C239.

Furthermore, substituting the inert electrolyte with the active cobalt electrolyte gives rise to apparently accelerated absorption decays (traces e–h in Fig. 3) for all oxidized dye molecules, indicative of rapid reduction of oxidized dyes by cobalt(II) ions in our cells. Using the same protocol as above, the mean reaction times (<τ>reg) of dye regeneration are derived, being 14, 14, 20 and 76 μs for C239, C240, C218 and C241, respectively. Evidently, there is a stepwise deceleration of dye regeneration kinetics from C240 to C218 and to C241. This is further supported by the square-wave voltammograms of dye-coated titania films (Fig. S2†), where the incorporation of Si-, C- and N-bridging atoms is found to gradually shift the ground-state redox potentials (VD+/D) of dyes to a more negative potential (C240: 0.27 V, C218: 0.25 V and C241: 0.24 V vs. Fc+/Fc), affording a decreased Gibbs free energy for dye regeneration. However, no positive correlation between VD+/D and dye regeneration kinetics is found during the comparison between C239 and C240, which exhibit the same <τ>reg value even though C239 has a more positive VD+/D (0.29 V vs. Fc+/Fc) than C240.
In light of the Marcus electron transfer theory,21,22 apart from the reaction free energy, two other factors can affect the kinetics of dye regeneration: (i) the electron coupling HAD of the electron donor and acceptor states and (ii) the reorganization energy λreg which to a large extent depends on the polarity of the solvent molecules and the electronic/steric characters of a dye molecule. As discussed above, the peculiarity of the C239 dye, which also accounts for the measured smallest surface coverage, longest <τ>bet and weakest light-harvesting capacity, consists in its non-planar structure and the consequent localization of the HOMO on the donor group. One can intuitively argue that the spatial localization of the HOMO in C239 might yield a larger geometrical rearrangement upon oxidation and hence a larger reorganization energy for the regeneration process. The calculated λreg values in Table 2 confirm this hypothesis, being in fact 0.14, 0.11, 0.10 and 0.11 eV for C239, C240, C218 and C241. The larger reorganization energy for C239 might explain the measured slower regeneration rate (14 μs) despite its more positive oxidation potential (0.29 V). Overall, in spite of dye-dependent dual-channel charge transfer kinetics, the kinetic branch ratio of <τ>bet to <τ>reg exceeds 22 for all of the four dyes, suggesting the efficient retardation of geminate charge recombination between injected electrons in titania and holes remaining in the oxidized dye molecules at the titania/dye/electrolyte interface.
The influence of π-linker rigidification with fastening atoms Si, C and N on photovoltaic performance was first evaluated by measuring photocurrent action spectra (Fig. 5A) of cells with a tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt(II/III) redox electrolyte. Limited by the poor light harvesting capacity (Fig. S3†) of a C239 dye-coated thin titania film, the C239 cell exhibits lower than 74% incident photon-to-collected electron conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) in the wavelength range from 400 to 650 nm, while the noticeably enhanced IPCEs of C240, C218 and C241 cells in the whole visible region clearly embody the merit of improving the absorption coefficient of a push–pull chromophore. The IPCE of a DSC can be expressed as IPCE(λ) = ηlh(λ) × ηcs × ηcoll(λ), where ηcs is wavelength-independent net charge separation yield, and ηlh(λ) and ηcoll(λ) are the respective wavelength-dependent light-harvesting and charge collection efficiencies that determine the wavelength-dependent IPCEs. It is noticed from Fig. 5(A) that the IPCE of the C240 cell evidently decreases from its peak at 470 nm, which sharply contrasts the IPCE plateau of the C218 cell, suggesting that the employment of the dihexyldithienosilole π-spacer in a triphenylamine-cyanoacrylic acid dye would probably cause inefficient charge collection.

An anti-reflection film was adhered to a testing cell during measurements. Aperture area of the employed metal mask: 0.158 cm2. 
The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics measured at the 100 mW cm−2, simulated AM1.5G conditions are presented in Fig. 5B, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are collected in Table 3. Amongst these four dyes, C239 exhibits an impressive open-circuit photovoltage of 1.05 V. However, bridging the two thiophene rings with Si, C and N generally diminishes open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), being 0.99, 0.95 and 0.86 V, respectively. Moreover, in agreement with the integral of IPCEs over the standard AM1.5G solar emission spectrum, the improved short-circuit current densities (Jsc) of the C240, C218 and C241 cells remarkably contribute to the overall power conversion efficiencies (η). With a Jsc of 13.01 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.76, our C218 dye featuring the dihexyl-substituted cyclopentadithiophene π-linker yields an efficiency of 9.4%.

a The validity of our photovoltaic data is further confirmed by comparing the calculated Jscvia wavelength integration of the product of the standard AM1.5G emission spectrum (ASTM G173-03) and measured IPCE curve with the experimentally measured Jsc, showing a less than 5% error. Also note that our cells have a linear dependence of photocurrent on light intensity.

To understand the physical origin of the observed Voc reduction upon the employment of a photosensitizer featuring a rigidified π-conjugation unit, we focus on the dyes with the most contrasting photovoltages, i.e. C239 and C241. Note that the quasi-Fermi-level (EF,n) of titania electrons actually determines the open-circuit photovoltage of DSCs based on a certain redox system: (1)where Ec is the conduction band edge of a dye-coated titania film in contact with an electrolyte, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, nc is the free electron density in titania and Nc the total density of states in titania conduction band. Eqn (1) will be used to analyze the dye-dependent cell photovoltage by parsing the thermodynamic (Ec) and kinetic (nc) factors of DSCs. To unveil the energetics of C239 and C241 dye-coated titania films, we derived the chemical capacitance (Cμ, Fig. S4A†) of titania films from electrical impedance measurements.23,24 Note that all impedance measurements were performed at an equivalent one sun irradiation from a white LED, to ensure a reliable physical analysis of DSCs under actual operational conditions. The procedure of Cμ analysis is described in the ESI.†
It is estimated that the employment of C239 has led to a 0.26 eV larger energy gap of Ec − EF,redox (C239: 1.39 eV, and C241: 1.13 eV), i.e. a higher Ec position, than that of C241. From the energy diagrams of stained titania films shown in Fig. 6, we may conclude that the 0.26 eV higher conduction band edge of a C239-coated titania film has made a major contribution to its 0.19 V higher EF,n than that of the C241 cell. Considering the smaller dye coverage and dipole moment of C239 compared to other systems in the series (See Tables 1 and 2), the TiO2 conduction band upshift is quite surprising and is probably related to different adsorptions of electrolyte components on titania, which could be altered by different dye-packing modes.
 Fig. 6  Energy diagrams of dye-coated titania films. The Ec and EF,n levels versus EF,redox of an open-circuit DSC under full sunlight are also included. The dotted density of states (DOS) were obtained from impedance measurements. 
However, by comparing the energy gaps of Ec − EF,n, we notice that there is actually a larger energy loss (C239: 0.34 eV, C241: 0.27 eV) in the C239 cell, which can result in a lower free electron density in titania. With eqn (1), the estimated nc values of the open-circuit C239 and C241 cells under the full sunlight are 1.2 × 1015 and 1.9 × 1016 cm−3, respectively, of which the difference between represents an EF,n difference of −0.07 eV from C239 to C241. It is valuable to note here that the nc value actually stems from the kinetic balance between the fluxes of charge photogeneration and titania/electrolyte interface charge recombination. To assess the contribution of the remarkably enhanced charge photogeneration of C241 to the higher free electron density, we plotted the short-circuit photocurrent density at various light intensities versus the corresponding open-circuit photovoltage, as shown in Fig. S4B.† It can be noticed that with respect to the C239 cell, the ∼2-fold larger Jsc of the C241 cell accounts for a Voc enhancement of 0.03 V.
On the basis of these analyses, we could arrive at the conclusion that the C241 dye-coated titania film/electrolyte interface must present a slower charge recombination at the open-circuit condition, which benefits the cell photovoltage by 0.04 V. It should be noted that from the preceding transient absorption measurements carried out on open-circuit cells, the flux of recombination between titania electrons and oxidized dyes is negligible compared to the highly efficient dye regeneration. Thereby, the charge recombination affecting cell photovoltage should be mainly ascribed to titania electrons captured by the oxidized species in our electrolyte. To substantiate the above deduction, we compare the titania/electrolyte charge recombination kinetics, which can be derived from the charge transfer resistance Rct (Fig. S4C, refer to ESI for analysis method†) modelled from impedance spectroscopies.25,26 Our result shows that the employment of the N-hexyldithienopyrrole-containing C241 dye presents an effective recombination rate constant (U0k) of 2.5 × 1022 cm−3 s−1 and a reaction order (β) of 0.46 for titania electrons, both of which are smaller than those of the case with C239 dye (U0k: 1.3 × 1023 cm−3 s−1, β: 0.50), indicating a relatively suppressed electron transfer from titania nanocrystals to oxidized species in our electrolyte.
Conclusions
To summarize, we have investigated some general influences of π-linker rigidification upon the optoelectronic features of DSCs based on a cobalt(II/III) redox electrolyte, with a special focus on the energetic and kinetic interplays. Both electronic absorption and photocurrent action spectrum measurements have verified the merit of rigidifying dithiophene π-linker for light-harvesting enhancement. However it is found that with respect to the di(3-hexylthiophene) dye, its analogues with rigidified π-linkers generally have lower open-circuit photovoltages. For example, the dithienopyrrole dye exhibits a 190 mV reduction in photovoltage compared to its di(3-hexylthiophene) counterpart, which stems mainly from a remarkable downward displacement of titania conduction band edge. Further efforts on probing the microscopic origins are necessary to pave the way for better materials design and thereby device improvement.
