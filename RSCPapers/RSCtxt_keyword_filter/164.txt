A facile in situ preparation of Ag nanoparticles was achieved by using POT as both a reductant and capping agent. Transient photocurrent and current–voltage curve measurements demonstrate that both the photocurrent response and power conversion efficiency of the Ag–POT/TiO2 film were markedly enhanced in comparison with that of the TiO2 only film and the POT/TiO2 film. Moreover, the Ag–POT/TiO2 film exhibited significant photoelectrocatalytic oxidation activity of dopamine. These results suggest their potential applications in photovoltaics as well as photoelectrocatalysis.1. IntroductionIn recent years, development of promising materials for photoelectrochemical application have attracted much attention in many areas such as photoelectrocatalysis, photovoltaic cells, and water splitting devices.1–3 Titania (TiO2), a wide-band-gap semiconductor, has been widely employed as a photoanode material in photoelectrochemical devices because of its low cost, nontoxicity, chemical stability and biocompatibility. However, most applications of TiO2 often suffer from a dissatisfactory light-to-electricity conversion efficiency according to the electron–hole recombination phenomenon.4,5 To solve these problems, many experiments have been studied, including morphological control, metal modification, and combination with other materials, etc.6,7Polyoxometalates (POMs) are a large class of inorganic early transition metal oxygen anionic clusters, which exhibit rich redox and photoelectrochemical properties because of their structural diversity and electronic versatility.8,9 POM anions can undergo reversible multielectron redox reactions in retaining intact structure, and this made POMs a kind of good electron acceptor to promote electron transfer rate of the semiconductor conduction band (CB) by trapping photogenerated electrons. Incorporation of POM into semiconductor could retard effectively the fast electron–hole recombination.In the past decade, noble metal nanoparticles have been noticed due to their prospective application in various fields like sensors, catalysis and drug delivery, mainly due to their special optical and electronic properties.10–12 In particularly, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) seem to be intriguingly interesting to fabricate and study, since the bulk has exhibited high electron-transfer ability. Zhang and Yao's group reported the one-pot synthesis of AgNPs/POMs/carbon nanotube tri-component hybrid, and showed the enhancement of AgNPs for electrocatalytic activities toward oxygen reduction reaction.13Dopamine (DA) is one of the most significant neurotransmitters in biological systems.14,15 It is essential to measure the level of DA in order to monitor neurotransmission process and diagnose Parkinson's disease.16 Due to the high electrochemical activity of DA and good biocompatibility of TiO2, electrochemical methods have been widely explored for DA detection.17 TiO2–graphene nanocomposite were reported by Fan's group to electrocatalysis DA.18 Majidi and coworkers demonstrated that TiO2–plant tissue electrode promoted the electrocatalytic oxidation of DA.19Recently, our group has reported that the incorporating of POMs into phthalocyanine or CdS composite films can effectively enhance their photovoltaic performance.20,21 So in this work, considering both the high electron mobility from AgNPs and the high electron–hole separation efficiency from POMs, we attempted to synthesise the Ag–POT nanohybrids facilely, and then fabricate the Ag–POT/TiO2 nanocomposite films, which create a synergistic effect on photovoltaic and photoelectrocatalysis performances comparing to the TiO2 photoanodes. Furthermore, to make the full use of these films, the performance of photoelectrocatalysis of dopamine was also investigated. All these results were obtained in accordance with our expectation, and may provide valuable information for photovoltaic and photoelectrochemical applications.2. Experimental2.1. MaterialsK6P2W18O62 and TiO2 were prepared according to literature methods.22–24 The preparation and characterization were described briefly in the ESI, Fig. S1–S4.†Nanohybrid of Ag–POT was synthesised as follows:25 the K6P2W18O62 was firstly reduced photochemically. A 500 W Hg lamp was used as an ultra-violet (UV) light source. In a typical synthesis, K6P2W18O62 (40 ml, 0.5 mM) was added in a quartz beaker and mixed with isopropanol (0.14 ml). Then the mixed solution was irradiated under the UV light for 30 min. Aqueous solution of AgNO3 (2 ml, 10 mM) was added at room temperature under stirring, and the nanohybrids were prepared after 1 h of reaction. The nanoparticles were separated by high speed centrifugation, washed twice with water and finally redispersed in water.3-Aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APS) and poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS) (Mw = 70000) were purchased from Aldrich and used without further treatment. Other reagent were of AR grade. The water used in all experiments was deionized to a resistivity of 18 MΩ cm.2.2. Preparation of the multilayer electrodeQuartz substrates, silicon wafers and indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass using for the film fabrication of self-assembly were cleaned according to a literature procedure.26 All these substrates were put into APS for 2 h at least, and then APS-modified substrates were immersed into HCl (pH = 2.0) for 20 min to get an amino cation surface. To obtain (POT/TiO2)2 films, the substrate-supported precursor films were alternately dipped into the POT (1 × 10−3 M) solution and the TiO2 colloidal dispersion for 10 min and 1 min, respectively, then rinsed with deionized water and dried in nitrogen stream after each dipping. Finally, the samples were heated at 80 °C for 6 h to establish electrical contact among the nanoparticles. For comparison, (PSS/TiO2)2 films and (Ag–POT/TiO2)2 thin films were prepared in a similar way.2.3. Thin film characterizationUV-vis absorption spectra of quartz-supported films were recorded on a 756CRT UV-visible spectrophotometer. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed in air with a SPI3800N Probe Station. X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) were measured on silicon wafers using an ESCALAB MK II Surface Analysis System. All photoelectrochemical experiments were performed on a CHI660C Electrochemical Workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Corp., China) at room temperature. A three-electrode system was employed in a quartz cell with an Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) electrode as the reference electrode, a platinum foil as the counter electrode, and the composite films-assembled ITO glass as the working electrode. A 300 W xenon lamp was used as a light source, and the irradiance for UV radiation that reaching the composite films was measured to be ca. 6.8 × 102 μW cm−2. The illumination area of working electrode was set constant at 1.8 × 1.0 cm2. All photoelectrochemical measurements were done in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte which was exposed to air.3. Results and discussion3.1. Characterization of the Ag–POT nanohybridsThe Ag–POT nanohybrids were characterization by TEM and UV-vis absorption spectrum. Fig. 1A shows a representative image of the obtained Ag–POT, and the average size of AgNPs is about 20.78 nm. Fig. 1B gives a higher-magnification TEM image of one AgNPs and POMs, and the size distribution image of AgNPs was shown in Fig. 1C. As shown in Fig. 1D, UV-vis absorption spectra exhibits the characteristic bands of POT at about 198 and 298 nm, and the absorption band of AgNPs appeared at about 446 nm was shown in the insert map obviously. Fig. 1  Characterization of Ag–POT: (A) TEM image of Ag–POT (scale bar: 100 nm); (B) HRTEM image of Ag–POT (scale bar: 5 nm); (C) size distribution of AgNPs; (D) UV-vis absorption spectrum of Ag–POT. (Inset) Interception of the UV-vis absorption band of AgNPs. 3.2. UV-vis spectra characterization of the multilayer filmsThe layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly of the anionic POT and the cationic TiO2 colloidal particles onto the substrate depends on the Coulomb force between the oppositely charged species. UV-vis spectroscopy was used to monitor the LbL adsorption process. Fig. 2 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the (Ag–POT/TiO2)2 multilayers assembled on a quartz substrate (on both sides). The characteristic absorption bands of POT (198 nm and 298 nm)and TiO2 (248 nm) in the UV region were increased linearly with the number of layers (Fig. S5†). The absorption band of Ag nanoparticles were not seen at 446 nm for the low adsorption quantity. This image indicates that the (Ag–POT/TiO2)2 multilayers have been constructed uniformly and homogeneously. Fig. 2  UV-vis absorption spectra of multilayer films (Ag–POT/TiO2)2 on quartz substrates (from lower to upper curves). The dashed line represents spectra after Ag–POT deposition, the solid line represents spectra after TiO2 deposition. In addition, a similar behavior was observed for PSS/TiO2 and POT/TiO2 multilayer films (Fig. S6 and S7†), which also demonstrate the nearly same amount of TiO2 nanoparticles in different films on quartz substrates. The surface coverage (Γ) of TiO2 on the LbL films can quantificationally be calculated using the equation Γ = NAAnλTiO2/2nελ,27 where NA is Avogadro's constant, AnλTiO2 (AnλTiO2 = Anλtotal − AnλPOMs, n ≥ 1) is the absorbance of TiO2 at a given wavelength (λ = 248 nm), Anλtotal is the total absorbance, AnλPOMs is the absorbance of POMs, ελ is the molar extinction coefficient of TiO2 (M−1 cm−1), and n is the number of bilayers. By such a calculation, we obtained the following results: the ratio of the surface coverage amount of TiO2 in the (PSS/TiO2)2 film to that in (POT/TiO2)2 film is 1.32:1.00, and the ratio of that in the (Ag–POT/TiO2)2 film to that in the (POT/TiO2)2 film is 1.13:1.00.3.3. X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS)XPS spectra used to identify the chemical composition and the binding energy of the (Ag–POT/TiO2)2 film on silicon substrates. Fig. 3 shows the signal peaks of Ag, Ti, P and W in the film which confirmed the presence of these elements. There is a Ag 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 doublet with the binding energies of 368.3 and 374.3 eV, respectively. The Ti 2p peak is observed at 458.8 and 464.4 eV, corresponding to Ti4+ of TiO2.28 The peaks of W 4f and P 2p are detected at 35.6, 37.6 and 133.4 eV, which also give a expected atom ratio of POT approximately in quantitation.29 These values suggest unambiguously that silver is present in the LbL film in the metallic form. These results indicate that POT, TiO2, and Ag nanoparticles are incorporated into the composite film indeed. Fig. 3  XPS spectra of the (Ag–POT/TiO2)2 film: (a) Ag; (b) Ti; (c) P; (d) W. 3.4. Morphology of the filmAFM can provide detailed information about the surface morphology and homogeneity of the deposited film. Fig. 4 shows the AFM images of the (PSS/TiO2)2 film (A), the (POT/TiO2)2 film (B), and the (Ag–POT/TiO2)2 film (C), respectively. After adsorption, all samples show typical spherical or granular morphologic feature which mainly due to the aggregation behavior of TiO2 colloidal nanoparticles.30,31 It can be obtained in Fig. 4A that the size and mean interface roughness of nanoparticles are 53.6 nm and 5.47 nm. Fig. 4B shows nanoparticles coagulated into larger scale agglomerates which are approximately 83.9 nm, and the interface roughness is 5.51 nm. Correspondingly, we can get the size and mean interface roughness of nanoparticles in Fig. 4C which are 57.9 nm and 5.52 nm respectively. In addition, a vertical grain structure of the multilayer surface can be observed from three-dimensional AFM images which show that the distribution of aggregated clusters is almost uniform.

Photocurrent transient measurementTo investigate the photoelectrochemical performance of the LbL films, photocurrent response experiments have been carried out at a constant bias of 0.1 V under Xe lamp irradiation in 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. Fig. 5 shows the photocurrent changes of the (PSS/TiO2)2 film (a), the (POT/TiO2)2 film (b), and the (Ag–POT/TiO2)2 film (c) when the irradiation is switched on and off. All the samples represent fast anodic photocurrent responses. We observed a intense increase in the photocurrent of the (Ag–POT/TiO2)2 film as compared to that of the (POT/TiO2)2 film and the (PSS/TiO2)2 film. Under the case that the surface coverage of TiO2 in these three films are close, it can be considered that POT improved the inherent photoelectrochemical response of TiO2 as an efficient electron scavenger, while the silver nanoparticles help to augment photocurrent for the excellent electric conductivity. These results demonstrate that photocurrent generation significantly depends on the component of the LbL films. Fig. 5  Photocurrent responses of (a) the (PSS/TiO2)2 film, (b) the (POT/TiO2)2 film, and (c) the (Ag–POT/TiO2)2 film in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. 3.6. Current–voltage (I–V) curvesTo further discuss the photoelectron-conversion efficiency of the LbL films, the I–V curves (Fig. 6) for the (PSS/TiO2)2 film (a), the (POT/TiO2)2 film (b), and the (Ag–POT/TiO2)2 film (c) have been measured upon illumination. The (PSS/TiO2)2 film shows a power conversion efficiency (η) of 4.4 × 10−3% with short-circuit current (Jsc) = 0.19 μA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) = 0.35 V, and fill factor (ff) = 0.45. For the (POT/TiO2)2 film, the I–V curve exhibits a Jsc of 0.39 μA cm−2 with an Voc of 0.28 V, a ff of 0.43, and a power conversion efficiency of η = 6.8 × 10−3%. In contrast, the (Ag–POT/TiO2)2 film has the highest power conversion efficiency of 9.5 × 10−3% with Jsc = 0.61 μA cm−2, Voc = 0.25 V, and ff = 0.42. The fill factor (ff) and power conversion efficiency (η, %) were calculated using the short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage.32 ff = (JmaxVmax)/(JscVoc)(1) η = Pout/Pin = ff(JscVoc)/Pin(2) Fig. 6  Current–voltage curves of (a) the (PSS/TiO2)2 film, (b) the (POT/TiO2)2 film, and (c) the (Ag–POT/TiO2)2 film under Xe lamp irradiation. Obviously, the (Ag–POT/TiO2)2 film displays the highest power conversion efficiency than the others, which is consistent with the results of the photocurrent transient measurements. This result demonstrates that the incorporation of POT and AgNPs into TiO2 films could effectively enhance the photovoltaic performance of TiO2. In the (POT/TiO2)2 film, POT plays the role of an efficient electron shuttle between the TiO2 conduction band (CB) and the ITO electrode, which is crucial in improving the photoelectrochemical performance as a negatively charged component. The redox potential of POT and the CB level of TiO2 are +0.34 and −0.5 V versus NHE, respectively (Fig. 7),33 thus suggesting that electron transfer from the TiO2 CB to POT is a favorable exothermic process. As a redox molecule with prominent electron transfer ability, POMs can potentially hinder the fast electron–hole recombination process on the surface of TiO2 either completely or at least to a very large extent.34 Fig. 7  Redox potentials and electron-transfer processes. In addition, through the combination of metal nanoparticles onto the semiconductor surface, the difference in the Fermi levels of metal and metal oxide leads to the continuous transfer of electrons from TiO2 to the metal nanoparticles.35–37 In the (Ag–POT/TiO2)2 films, AgNPs act as an electron sink for photoinduced charge carriers, and promote interfacial charge-transfer processes. Otherwise, with AgNPs in LbL films, the electrons transferred from TiO2 to POMs will readily transfer from POMs to the metal nanoparticles, which limited the phenomenon of electron–hole recombination. The photoelectrochemical performance of the composite films should in principle be enhanced on the basis of the composition of metal nanoparticles.3.7. Determination of dopamineTo explore the catalytic activity of the LbL films, the electrochemical experiments and photoelectrooxidation process of DA were investigated. Fig. 8A shows the cyclic voltammograms obtained with the bare ITO-electrode (a) and the (PSS/TiO2)2 film (b) for electrocatalytic using a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 in the presence of 0.05 mM DA in 0.2 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.5). It can be seen that the existence of TiO2 into the electrode support leads to the increased of cathodic and anodic currents for dopamine molecule compared with that at a bare ITO-electrode. Also, a obviously increased current response was obtained for DA at the (PSS/TiO2)2 electrode under Xe lamp irradiation, which was shown in Fig. 8A(c). The data obtained clearly show that the photoelectrooxidation process of DA at TiO2 electrode exhibit the best catalytic activity. Fig. 8  (A) Cyclic voltammograms obtained in the presence of 0.05 mM dopamine in 0.2 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.5) with (a) ITO-electrode, dark; (b) the (PSS/TiO2)2 film, dark; (c) the (PSS/TiO2)2 film, under illumination. (Inset) An enlarged region (−0.4 to 0.1 V) of the cyclic voltammogram. (B) Comparative of photocurrent–time responses with 0.05 mM DA per 50 s for the (a) the (PSS/TiO2)2 film, (b) the (POT/TiO2)2 film, and (c) the (Ag–POT/TiO2)2 film. (C) Dependence of photocurrent on DA concentration of (a) the (PSS/TiO2)2 film, (b) the (POT/TiO2)2 film, and (c) the (Ag–POT/TiO2)2 film. (D) Plot of DA concentration to photocurrent, C/Iphvs. C for (a) the (PSS/TiO2)2 film, (b) the (POT/TiO2)2 film, and (c) the (Ag–POT/TiO2)2 film. Fig. 8B shows the comparison of photocurrent–time responses with the addition of 0.05 mM DA per 50 s for the (PSS/TiO2)2 film (a), the (POT/TiO2)2 film (b), and the (Ag–POT/TiO2)2 film (c), and the concentration dependence on the photocurrent responses of these films were shown in Fig. 8C. The (Ag–POT/TiO2)2 film has the fast response and the highest photocurrent in each concentration of DA, which indicates that the combination of Ag nanoparticles and POMs could increasing the photoelectrooxidation activity for DA. We propose that the increase in the photocurrent measured in the presence of DA can be attributed to direct hole transfer, which is similar to the results reported by Marugán and coworkers.38,39 Furthermore, Fig. 8D displays the concentration/photocurrent (C/Iph) versus concentration plot for DA oxidation at the (PSS/TiO2)2 film (a), the (POT/TiO2)2 film (b), and the (Ag–POT/TiO2)2 film (c). The kinetics plot of the photoelectrooxidation of DA appears linearly in the 0.05–0.25 mM range, which obeys the Langmuir–Hinselwood kinetics equation.404. ConclusionsAg–POM/TiO2 composite films were successfully fabricated by the LbL self-assembly method, and demonstrated the highest photocurrent and power conversion efficiency than the PSS/TiO2 film and the POT/TiO2 film. These results could attribute to the enhancement of electron–hole separation efficiency by POMs and the promotion of electron transfer rate by AgNPs. On the other side, the Ag–POM/TiO2 films also indicate the most significant photoelectrocatalytic activity for DA than the others, which exhibits the biological sensor properties of the composite films. Although the overall efficiency is not remarkable, this work demonstrate the synergistic effect for the first time that the simple combination of POMs with metal nanoparticles could enhance the photovoltaic performance of TiO2, which is potentially useful in many applications including photocatalysis, solar photovoltaic cells, and water splitting devices.AcknowledgementsThe authors are thankful for the financial support from the Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 21001021 and 21273031).
