    , Accepted 5th January 2015First published on 20th January 2015AbstractUsing a combination of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and physics-based degradation models, we find that the early aging of small molecular weight organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells is due to photochemical degradation of the C60 acceptor layer. Planar and mixed boron subphthalocyanine chloride (SubPc)-donor/C60-acceptor heterojunctions show significant changes in their IR absorption spectra after aging under illumination, which we find is due to exciton-mediated photo-oligomerization of C60. The consequent decrease in exciton diffusion length in the C60 layer results from a decreased exciton lifetime for C60 oligomers (e.g. C120 and C180) compared to that of the monomer. The model describes the short-circuit current reduction in planar SubPc/C60 OPV cells during early aging, and explains the lack of degradation in analogous mixed heterojunctions.
Introduction
Small molecular weight organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells are experiencing a period of rapid progress, with single junction power conversion efficiencies now exceeding 8%.1,2 For this progress to translate into a practical energy generation technology, the operational lifetime of OPV's must extend to >15 years by some estimates.3 For such a significant improvement to be realized, a comprehensive understanding of the degradation pathways of OPVs is needed to guide the development of future materials and device architectures. While many intrinsic and extrinsic OPV failure modes have been reported,4–6 physical models that both describe and predict their dominant degradation pathways are required.
Rapid degradation has been widely reported during early aging of planar heterojunction (HJ) OPV cells that employ C60 and other fullerene derivatives as acceptors.7–10 Upon illumination, the short-circuit current density (JSC) drops exponentially and saturates at a lower value after several hours—an effect known as “burn-in”. The performance loss is linearly dependent on the number of photons absorbed by C60 independent of device current, and can be eliminated by mixing the donor and acceptor molecules in the active region.7
Here we investigate the degradation of organic thin films over extended periods using time-dependent Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The photochemical stability of the materials is determined by measuring the FTIR absorption spectra of as-deposited films and those aged under a variety of conditions. When aged under white light illumination in a N2 ambient, thin films of the archetype donor, boron subphthalocyanine chloride (SubPc), and the exciton blocking layer, 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic bis-benzimidazole (PTCBI), exhibit almost no IR absorption changes compared with the as-grown films, while C60 undergoes a significant photochemical transformation. We find that the photoinduced oligomerization of C60 decreases the exciton lifetime and diffusion length, reducing the JSC in OPVs comprised of this material.
Theory
In an OPV cell, photons are absorbed throughout the bulk of the active region, generating excitons. The light-induced exciton profile can be calculated using the transfer matrix method,11 and varies as a function of position for each wavelength, λ. In a planar HJ device, the excitons either diffuse to the donor/acceptor HJ where they dissociate into free carriers, or otherwise recombine in the bulk. This process is described by the steady-state diffusion equation: (1)where D is the exciton diffusivity, N(x) is their density as a function of λ and position, x, from the HJ, kloss is the exciton recombination rate, and G(x) is the generation rate. Using eqn (1) to solve for the exciton flux to the HJ at a given λ and dividing by the number of incident photons, gives the external quantum efficiency (EQE), which can be integrated over λ to find JSC.
Fullerene photo-oligomerization is the light-induced formation of chemical bonds between adjacent molecules that has been reported in C60, C70, and other fullerene derivatives.12–14 Solution-based transient absorption measurements have shown that the exciton lifetime of C60 oligomers (C120 and C180) is shorter than that of the monomer.15–17 In the C60 acceptor layer, a portion of nonradiative exciton decay events result in the formation of oligomers. The fraction of monomers remaining at time, t, can be expressed as: (2)where M(x, t) is the monomer density at time t, M0 is the initial monomer density, kF is the oligomer formation rate, and Γ∞ is the percentage of monomers that are unable to oligomerize due to their energetic and chemical environments. Including the effects of C60 oligomerization, eqn (1) becomes: (3)where k1 is the exciton recombination rate on C60 monomers, and k2+ is the rate on the oligomers. The observed lifetime saturation in solution measurements follows C60 > C120 ≈ C180,16 and hence only a single rate, k2+, is required.
Results
The EQE was measured as a function of aging time (Fig. 1a) for an OPV whose structure is shown in the inset of Fig 1b. The decrease in EQE occurs almost entirely at shorter wavelengths where C60 strongly absorbs. Hence, in Fig. 1b we show the EQE as a function of aging time at λ = 450 nm. At this wavelength, SubPc absorption is negligible and C60 absorption is unchanged after aging, as shown in Fig. 1c. Hence, we conclude that the changes in EQE are not due to changes in film optical properties at this wavelength.

To evaluate the chemical stability of organic thin films, FTIR absorption spectra in Fig. 2 were obtained both before and after aging under different conditions (see Methods) for SubPc, PTCBI, and C60. The initial spectrum for each film was measured immediately following thin-film growth. Additional spectra were obtained after one week of aging under various conditions: aged in the dark in N2 (dark/N2), in the dark in air (dark/air), under 150 W Xe arc lamp illumination through a polycarbonate window in a purified N2 glovebox (light/N2), and under AM1.5G simulated solar illumination in air (light/air).

The donor, SubPc, exhibits almost no changes in IR absorption after aging under the conditions encountered in packaged devices (light/N2, see Fig. 2a). When aged in the dark, (either in air or N2), there is a slight increase in the intensity of peaks at S1 = 1468 cm−1, S2 = 960 cm−1, and S3 = 747 cm−1, with an additional absorption peak (S4) appearing between 1710 and 1760 cm−1 for the dark/air sample. This peak is associated with the CO double bond stretching mode, indicating the formation of new functional groups.18
The PTCBI exciton blocking layer exhibits no significant spectral changes (Fig. 2b), except for a weak absorption peak appearing at P1 = 1732 cm−1 after aging under all tested conditions.
The vibrational spectrum of C60 has been extensively explored.12,13,19 Of the 174 molecular vibrational modes of C60, only four satisfy the condition for IR activity:19i.e. dμ/dr ≠ 0, where μ is the dipole moment and r is the vibrational nuclear displacement. These four modes appear in the IR spectra at C1 = 1429 cm−1, C2 = 1182 cm−1, C3 = 575 cm−1, and C4 = 526 cm−1 as shown in Fig. 2c. In the as-grown and aged/dark spectra, these modes are the only absorption features present except for a weak peak at C5 = 1539 cm−1, which is consistent with previous experimental measurements on pristine C60.12 In the absence of illumination, no changes are observed when the samples are aged. Once exposed to light in N2, the intensities of modes C1–C5 are significantly weakened compared to the as-grown film. Additionally, several new peaks are observed: one at D1 = 1385 cm−1, with several minor features emerging between 800 and 550 cm−1 (D2). In air under illumination, a broad absorption feature also appears between 1700 cm−1 and 1800 cm−1 (D3) due to oxidation.

In situ, time-dependent FTIR measurements over a period of 24 h were obtained for both planar and blended SubPc/C60 (see Methods). During aging, the intensities of the C60 peaks (C1–C4) decrease in both structures, while the oligomer peaks (D2) present in the light/N2 spectra emerge, and SubPc features remain unchanged. These spectral changes indicate the presence of C60 oligomerization in both planar and blended OPV active regions. The C1–C4 peaks, normalized to their initial values, are shown in Fig. 3. In the planar structure (Fig. 3a), all four peaks decrease rapidly, reaching values between 29% and 56% of their initial intensities after 24 h. In the blended junction (Fig. 3b), the peak heights decrease more slowly—maintaining between 63% and 79% of their starting intensity.

To determine the concentration of C60 monomers after aging (Γ∞), laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectra were obtained for a 50 nm C60/11 nm SubPc junction dissolved in toluene following aging in N2, both in the presence and absence of illumination. After soaking in toluene for several seconds, the dark-aged sample completely dissolved. Under a similar treatment, the light-aged SubPc layer dissolved rapidly while the fullerene layer remained even after >1 h; a signature of oligomerization.12 To ensure that the insolubility was due to bulk oligomerization rather than a protective oligomerized surface layer, the remaining film was scraped into the solution, where it remained as insoluble flakes. Thus, only monomers in the aged film are returned to the solution. As a result, spectral features from SubPc (M = 431 Da) and C60 (M = 720 Da) were present in both samples, with no apparent oligomeric peaks. Based on the densities of C60 = 1.65 g cm−3 and SubPc = 1.53 g cm−3, the film thicknesses (C60 = 50 nm, SubPc = 11 nm), and their molecular weights, the expected ratio of C60 to SubPc molecules is 2.93. The detected molecular ratio, assuming similar ionization/desorption rates, was 3.27 ± 0.01 in the as-grown sample. After aging, the ratio was reduced to 0.34 ± 0.01, indicating that much of the monomer content was lost to oligomerization. Dividing the final by the initial C60/SubPc ratio, the percentage of C60 monomers remaining is found to be Γ∞ = 10.4 ± 0.02%.
Discussion
SubPc has three exposed benzene rings, as can be seen in the inset of Fig 1c. These sites have a significant potential for oxidation. In the presence of light and air, significant photochemical transformations occur between SubPc and atmospheric O2 and H2O. As apparent in the light/air spectrum in Fig. 2a, there is a broad increase in absorption from 1600–1800 cm−1, and the SubPc peaks characteristic in the as-grown film are suppressed. This is attributed to the ingress of water into the polar SubPc film and increased CO content indicated by the peak at S1 = 1750 cm−1. This feature is more intense and broad after light/air aging compared to that observed in dark/air, indicating that a larger fraction of SubPc molecules are oxidized, and that there are likely a variety of chemical environments surrounding the CO functional groups. Strong photo-oxidation is consistent with previously observed photo-bleaching of SubPc visible light absorption in air.20
While exciton recombination far from the HJ reduces EQE, it can also negatively impact device stability by inducing defect formation.7 For C60, the exciton energy is sufficient to drive 2 + 2 cyclo-addition between the carbon double bonds of adjacent C60 molecules to form oligomeric by-products.12 As a result, the molecular symmetry responsible for the dark singlet state of C60 is reduced, which shortens the exciton lifetime of the new oligomer. While this increased recombination rate has not been directly measured in thin films to date, the trend observed in solution (monomer > oligomer) is consistent with the device aging measurements where a reduced exciton lifetime leads to a concomitant reduction in diffusion length, and hence in EQE and JSC. Oligomerization was not detected in SubPc, which is likely due to its decreased molecular symmetry, CC bond density, and exciton lifetime compared with C60.
To model the effects of decreased exciton lifetime on OPV performance, eqn (3) was solved assuming complete quenching (N(x) = 0) at the donor/acceptor interface, ideal exciton blocking (dN(x)/dx = 0) at the C60/PTCBI interface, and complete oligomerization of all monomers after burn-in (Γ∞ = 0). Values provided in Table 1 were used for the exciton recombination rate and diffusivity of C60 and SubPc prior to degradation.21–24 To fit the rate of exciton recombination by oligomers, k2+ was varied until the discrepancy between the simulated and measured external quantum efficiencies (EQE) at λ = 450 nm after burn-in (k2+ = 5.8 ± 0.04 × 106 s−1) was minimized. With k2+ known, the EQE at λ = 450 nm is then fit as a function of aging, as shown in Fig. 1b (line), to obtain kF = 80 ± 4 s−1. Values for the fitted rates are given in Table 1. Using these rates, the effect of decreasing diffusion length on the measured EQE was simulated from λ = 300 nm to λ = 700 nm, as shown in Fig. 4a. Since the evolution of C60 optical constants is not known as functions of position or wavelength within the device, the as-grown C60 optical constants were used. For this reason, the simulation in Fig. 4a closely matches the measured data in Fig. 1a where the C60 absorbance does not vary with time (e.g. from λ = 450 nm to 700 nm).

Assuming constant exciton diffusivity, the probability for exciton recombination in a film that contains both monomers and oligomers, is: p(t) = exp[−k1Γt]exp[−k2+t(1 − Γ)].(4)
The effective exciton lifetime is therefore: τeff = [k1Γ + k2+(1 − Γ)]−1,(5)with a corresponding exciton diffusion length of: (6)
While the values of k2+ and Γ in eqn (5) cannot be independently obtained by measuring the loss in EQE over time, only LD = 16.6 ± 0.1 nm (decreased from LD = 40 nm at t = 0) can result in the observed EQE decrease, assuming k2+ = 5.8 ± 0.04 × 106 s−1 at Γ∞ = 0. As aging proceeds, LD and Γ decrease along a vertical line in Fig. 4b corresponding to the oligomer lifetime (τ2+ = 1/k2+), until LD = 16.6 ± 0.1 nm is reached as the aging process is completed. Using the final monomer concentration detected by mass spectrometry (Γ∞ = 10.4 ± 0.02%) along with LD in eqn (6), a corresponding oligomer lifetime of 1/k2+ = 156 ± 2 ns is found.
The effect of the reduced exciton lifetime in the acceptor is reflected in the steady-state exciton profile in Fig. 4c. Since all excitons are dissociated at the HJ, N(0) → 0, while the exciton concentration decreases with time for x > 0. Fig. 4d indicates that the oligomer density increases most rapidly where the exciton density is highest.
Evidence linking C60 photochemical degradation to burn-in is inferred from the FTIR spectra and previously measured OPV stability, where devices with SubPc as the donor and PTCBI as the exciton blocker were found to be stable during early aging when C70 replaced C60 in a planar structure.7 In this work, the IR absorption spectra of SubPc and PTCBI are unchanged after aging in light/N2 compared with C60, which changes dramatically, as shown in Fig. 2. When a four-atom carbon square forms between adjacent C60 molecules during oligomerization, new vibrational modes appear as weak absorption features (D2 in Fig. 2c). The appearance of these vibrational modes may also account for the spectral broadening in the C60 visible absorption spectrum in Fig. 1.10,20
Alternative degradation mechanisms affecting charge extraction rather than generation have been previously explored by Zhang, et al.,10 such as a decrease in mobility of oligomer films. However, the rapid decrease in fill factor which would occur was not observed in that work, nor in the devices explored here. Similarly, the open-circuit voltage of the devices in this work is stable compared with JSC during early aging, which suggests that only the charge generation process is affected, whereas a reduction in VOC and FF reflect increased charge recombination and reduced extraction efficiency, respectively.25 Taking these observations into account, we infer that the decreased exciton lifetime in the C60 layer is the dominant mechanism leading to a reduction in JSC during early aging. Modeling based on this mechanism fits the measured data, as apparent in Fig. 1b.
This analysis differs somewhat from that recently proposed by Tong, et al.,7 which was also found to accurately fit the aging characteristics of planar SubPc/C60 planar OPVs. In that work, the reduction in JSC was attributed to increased exciton recombination at quenching sites that form during burn-in, saturating at approximately 0.01% of the C60 concentration. Indeed, the model presented by Tong et al. is one extreme of the exciton diffusion length model presented in Fig. 4b where LD is reduced to its equilibrium value by the formation of a low density of extremely efficient quenching sites. However, using direct chemical analysis methods, we find evidence for a significant population of oligomers in the C60 film after aging, supporting both the chemical composition and the high defect density proposed here. The models also differ in their explanations for the saturation of burn-in. Tong et al. implies that the saturation may be due to a large capture radius of the exciton by the traps. However, this would also result in a vanishing contribution to the EQE arising from absorption in C60 with time, which is clearly not observed. Alternatively, the saturation of change toward the end of burn-in can be due to the exhaustion of some extrinsic reactant, such as residual oxygen or water in the package. However, this has not been directly observed, and does not explain the presence of burn-in observed in unencapsulated devices10 or the lack of burn-in in mixed HJ C60:SubPc devices.7
Tong, et al. also demonstrated that blending of the donor/acceptor HJ eliminated burn-in.7 This was attributed to the elimination of long-lived excitons in the donor/acceptor blends where dissociation can occur much faster than the formation of defects.7 Nevertheless, C60 photochemical degradation is evident even in the blend (see Fig. 3b). While the changes are slower and less pronounced than in the planar junction, all of the photochemical transformations present in the fully oligomerized C60 film are also found as the blended film ages. Our model indicates that OPV performance is unaffected by these changes when the exciton diffusion length is larger than the fullerene nanocrystalline domain size in the mixed HJ.
Finally, we note that oxygen acts as an efficient quencher of the first excited triplet state in C60 and diffuses rapidly under illumination.12,17,26 The ingress of oxygen suppresses the formation of fullerene-only oligomers by rapidly quenching excitons and reacting with C60 to form a variety of oxidized fullerite species, such as C60O and C120O.27 The altered photochemical environment resulting from these species explains the discrepancy between the light/N2 and light/air IR spectra in Fig. 2c.
Conclusions
A physics-based model was developed that links photo-oligomerization of C60 to the “burn-in” of JSC and efficiency losses in planar, small molecule OPV cells. Due to the decreased exciton lifetime of oligomers compared with the C60 monomer, the exciton diffusion length decreases with oligomerization, reducing the flux of excitons to the donor/acceptor HJ. The process exponentially slows as the monomer population is depleted, and concludes once all of the oligomerization sites are depleted. Direct evidence of oligomerization is obtained using FTIR spectroscopy on neat C60 films as well as planar and blended SubPc/C60 heterojunctions. The model accounts for the lack of burn-in observed in blended junction devices, where the distance an exciton must travel to reach a dissociating interface is short compared with LD even after degradation. While burn-in degradation is found to be prevalent in planar C60-based devices, both the SubPc donor and PTCBI blocking layers are found to be stable under illumination, indicating that photochemically stable small molecule OPVs may be achievable.
Methods
Prior to device fabrication, pre-patterned ITO-coated glass substrates were solvent cleaned by sonicating in a tergitol/deionised (DI) water solution, DI water, acetone twice, and isopropyl alcohol twice followed by rapid drying with N2. Solvent cleaned substrates were then snow cleaned with a stream of CO2 gas for 1 min on a 100 °C hot plate,28 followed by exposure to ultraviolet-ozone for 10 min. The KBr substrates used for FTIR spectroscopy were used without solvent cleaning.
Organic thin films, metals, and metal oxides were deposited by thermal evaporation in high-vacuum (<10−6 Torr). Deposition rates were monitored in situ with quartz crystal microbalances and controlled at a maximum of 1 Å s−1. Blend ratios were obtained by varying the growth rates of the separate constituents. Thicknesses and optical constants of neat films were measured on Si using a variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometer. Device areas of 1 cm2 were defined by the intersection of the pre-patterned ITO anode and an Al cathode deposited through openings in a shadow mask. Substrates were transferred without air exposure into an ultra-high purity N2 glovebox (<1 ppm H2O and O2) for encapsulation using a pre-cut cover glass with a UV-curable epoxy bead applied around its periphery. A Cu mask was placed over the active region of the device during curing to prevent UV-damage.
The various thin films used for FTIR measurements were aged in N2 in the dark, in ambient air in the dark, under illumination from an AM1.5G filtered Xe arc lamp solar simulator in air, or under unfiltered 150 W Xe arc lamp illumination through a polycarbonate window in an ultra-pure N2 glovebox.
During testing, devices were illuminated by an AM1.5G filtered class AAA Xe arc lamp solar simulator at 100 W cm−2. Current–voltage characteristics were periodically measured using a semiconductor parameter analyzer. The EQE was measured with a lock-in current amplifier using monochromated light (Δλ = 5 nm) from a Xe arc lamp chopped at 200 Hz. An NREL traceable Si photodetector was used to measure the incident irradiance at each wavelength.
Mass spectrometry was measured from 400 to 5000 m/z, using a Bruker AutoFlex Speed MALDI-ToF mass spectrometer, with a desorption wavelength of 355 nm. Samples were grown by thermal vacuum evaporation on quartz substrates, as above. Following aging, the films were dissolved in a toluene solution, which was pipetted onto the mass spectrometry target where the solvent was allowed to evaporate. The measurement was taken without a host matrix in a vacuum of <10−7 Torr.
A Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer was used to study PTCBI, SubPc, C60, and SubPc/C60 films. The spectrometer was purged by N2 purified with an Alltech Hydropurge II moisture trap to reduce gaseous contamination >1 h before opening the arc lamp shutter. Transmission spectra were obtained from 400 cm−1 to 4000 cm−1. The spectra were corrected for atmospheric water interference and baseline, after which, the noise level in the spectra was <1% of the peak height. Each spectrum averaged 32 scans with a resolution of 4 cm−1. During measurements on blended and planar SubPc/C60 HJs, light from a 150 W Xe arc lamp was focused into a broadband liquid light guide to illuminate the thin film, while the chamber was purged continuously.
