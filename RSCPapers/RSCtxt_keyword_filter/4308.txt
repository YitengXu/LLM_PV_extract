    , Accepted 10th May 2019First published on 10th May 2019AbstractA key challenge in the eco-friendly optoelectronic materials field is to find highly stable and nontoxic perovskite materials. Here, we report the optoelectronic properties and stability of the (C6H5NH3)BiI4 perovskite material. Using an eco-friendly gas pump treatment technique, a dense and pinhole-free (C6H5NH3)BiI4 film was fabricated. Remarkably, a large-area (>20 cm2) Bi-based perovskite film was obtained, which is the largest Bi-based perovskite film ever reported. Besides, the (C6H5NH3)BiI4 perovskite exhibits good solubility in ethanol, which is a safe and eco-friendly solvent. Thermogravimetric analysis results show the beginning of weight loss at ∼184 °C, suggesting excellent heat stability of this material. Most importantly, the (C6H5NH3)BiI4 material can tolerate continuous moisture exposure for 334 days in ambient air owing to the presence of a hydrophobic organic chain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the longest moisture stability reported for lead-free perovskite materials so far. This work paves the way for realizing highly stable and nontoxic perovskite materials for potential optoelectronic applications.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic lead-based perovskite materials are emerging as highly fascinating semiconductors for use in a variety of applications, including photovoltaic devices,1–3 light-emitting diodes (LED),4,5 radiation detectors,6 nanocrystal scintillators,7 and semiconducting ferroelectrics.8 To date, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) has been certified to be well above 23%.9 Recently, lead-based perovskite LEDs with an external quantum efficiency of over 20% has been reported.4,5 However, almost all top-performing optoelectronic devices were made of lead-based perovskite materials with unsatisfactory stability. Human exposure to lead is pernicious to the nervous and reproductive systems, and this may weaken the market acceptance of this emerging technology.10,11 In addition, the use of toxic solvents (N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, and chlorobenzene) in the preparation of perovskites is another issue that needs to be solved as well, since these solvents can easily penetrate into the human body and diffuse into the atmosphere to cause global environmental pollution.12 Therefore, it is highly desirable to search for highly stable and nontoxic perovskite optoelectronic materials that can be prepared using eco-friendly solvents and solution-based deposition methods.
Previously, extensive efforts were devoted for the development of eco-friendly halide perovskite optoelectronic materials both experimentally and theoretically.13–16 The elements used to replace lead mainly include Sn,17–20 Ge,21,22 Bi,23–30 Sb,31 and Cu.32–34 Among these, Bi-based materials have attracted considerable attention as candidates for lead-free perovskites due to their long-term stability.23 Moreover, Bi3+ with 6s2 lone pairs15 might result in excellent optoelectronic properties. MA3Bi2I9 and Cs3Bi2I9 are the most extensively studied Bi-based perovskite materials. In 2015, Johansson et al. reported the photovoltaic performance of Bi-based halide compounds (Cs3Bi2I9 and MA3Bi2I9).23 However, the film quality of Cs3Bi2I9 and MA3Bi2I9 was not satisfactory.23 In 2017, Zhang et al. fabricated a highly compact, pinhole-free, and large-grained MA3Bi2I9 film by a costly vacuum deposition method.24 In 2018, Park et al. reported the resistive switching properties of A3Bi2I9 (A is either Cs+ or Rb+) and the devices showed a low operating voltage, large on/off ratio, relatively high endurance, and high retention.29 Besides, Tang et al. reported a new photoluminescence quantum yield record (54.1%) for blue emissive, Bi-based perovskite quantum dots.30
Bi-based materials usually exhibit a much better intrinsic stability than MAPbI3. For example, MA3Bi2I9 and Cs3Bi2I9 exhibit >25 days stability in air while MAPbI3 becomes yellow after 5 days.23,25 However, compared to silicon-based solar cells with 20 years stability, how to realize lead-free perovskites with a higher excellent intrinsic stability is still a big challenge in this field. One effective method to improve the stability of lead-based perovskites is to replace hygroscopic cations (MA+ or FA+) with hydrophobic groups, such as phenylethylammonium (PEA)35 and butylammonium (BA).36 For example, Tsai et al. reported (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13-based solar cells with a high PCE of 12.52% and outstanding moisture stability.36 Recently, (PMA)2CuBr4-based perovskites with high stability toward humidity, heat, and ultraviolet light have been achieved.34 However, realizing superior stability toward humidity and heat in organic–inorganic hybrid Bi-based perovskites is still a major challenge. This prompted us to explore highly stable Bi-based perovskite materials for potential optoelectronic applications.
In this paper, we report the optoelectronic properties and stability of PHABiI4 (PHA = C6H5NH3+) materials. This work is inspired by the research on low-dimensional perovskites with enhanced stability.34–36 Therefore, it is rational that Bi-based materials with hydrophobic PHA cations should well overcome the problems of toxicity and poor stability of lead-based perovskites in the meantime. The reason why we use PHA also includes the smaller molecular radius of PHA than PEA or PMA. Xiao et al.15 reported that the band gap can be lowered by controlling factors such as the molecular radius of the spacing cation. So, we speculate that PHABiI4 may have a wider absorption range than PEABiI4 or PMABiI4. We successfully fabricated a dense and pinhole-free PHABiI4 film via an eco-friendly gas pump treatment technique. Remarkably, we obtained a large-area (>20 cm2) Bi-based perovskite film, which is the largest Bi-based perovskite film ever reported. Besides, the PHABiI4 material exhibits excellent moisture stability of more than 330 days in ambient air at 50–70% relative humidity (RH). To the best of our knowledge, this is the longest moisture stability reported for lead-free perovskite materials so far. Moreover, the PHABiI4 material exhibits good solubility in ethanol, which is an eco-friendly solvent for solution processing other than water.
Results and discussion
The crystal structure of PHABiI4 is similar to that of C6H8NBiI4 perovskites (see Fig. 1a).27 It consists of one-dimensional edge-sharing chains composed of BiI6 octahedra connected by a hydrogen bonding interaction.27 The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of PHABiI4 in comparison to those of BiI3 and C6H5NH3I are also given in Fig. 1b. The dominant diffraction peaks of the PHABiI4 perovskite are at 2θ = 9.07°, 25.45°, and 26.58°. In addition, the experimental XRD results show good consistency with XRD simulation results (see Fig. S1†). We note that no additional peaks related to possible residues of BiI3 (three dominant peaks at 2θ = 10.23°, 20.48°, and 21.48°) have been observed in the XRD pattern of PHABiI4. However, one peak (2θ = 14.10°) was observed in the XRD pattern of PHABiI4, which can be attributed to traces of the C6H5NH3I compound (see Fig. 1b and S1†). The energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDX) is shown in Fig. 1c–e, wherein the distribution of Bi, I, and N elements in the PHABiI4 film is homogeneous. The obtained Bi/I atomic ratio is approximately 1:4, which is consistent with the stoichiometry in the molecule's formula (Fig. S2†).

The morphology of the perovskite film is a key factor that could severely limit device performance. To date, it is challenging to fabricate dense and pinhole-free Bi-based perovskite films by solution-based deposition methods.23,37 Consequently, it is vital to develop robust methods for fabricating high-quality Bi-based perovskite films. Here, we successfully fabricated dense and pinhole-free Bi-based perovskite films via a green gas pump treatment technique. For comparison, the schematic mechanism, photographs and SEM images of the PHABiI4 films fabricated by the conventional heat treatment and gas pump treatment in ambient air at 30% RH are shown in Fig. 2. The PHABiI4 film prepared by heat treatment (DMF as the solvent) shows a coarse surface morphology with very poor coverage (Fig. 2b), while the gas pump processed sample (ethanol as the solvent) exhibits a somewhat mirror-like, compact, and pinhole-free surface morphology (Fig. 2c and S3†). For the heat treatment, the morphology of the PHABiI4 film (ethanol as the solvent, see Fig. S5†) looks much better than that of the sample prepared using DMF as the solvent, which might be associated with the volatile nature of ethanol.

(c) Schematic mechanism, photograph, and SEM image of the (C6H5NH3)BiI4 film prepared by gas pump treatment. 
The process of perovskite growth from solution includes supersaturation, nucleation, and crystal growth. Two main factors for the fabrication of high-quality perovskite films are the density of nucleation sites and crystal growth time.38 The reason for the coarse morphology of the heat-treated sample is associated with the low nuclear density due to the low solvent evaporation rate of the heat treatment technique (Fig. 2b).18 Conversely, rapid solvent evaporation (within a few seconds) from solutions during gas pump treatment accelerates the supersaturation, resulting in a higher nuclear density, and then induces fast crystallization of uniformly sized Bi-based perovskite grains (see Fig. 2c).38,39 The above-mentioned relationship between the film morphology and nuclear density can be supported by the material nucleation/growth competition model in our previous work.40 It is worth mentioning that the PHABiI4 perovskite exhibits good solubility in ethanol, which is an eco-friendly and safe solvent.41 Furthermore, compared with the most widely used anti-solvent method,42 gas pump treatment technology is an environmentally benign processing route for the fabrication of high-quality lead-free perovskite films. For future research, it is apparent that more attention should be paid to solar cells or LEDs based on this Bi-based perovskite, just as the reports on lead-free halide double perovskites.43–45
To study the effect of the chamber pressure on the film morphology, PHABiI4 films were prepared by the gas pump treatment technique at different pressures. Dense and pinhole-free Bi-based perovskite films with a mirror-like surface (see Fig. S3†) were obtained when the pressure is from 1500 to 30000 Pa. The process window is much larger than that of Pb-based40 (100 to 1500 Pa) and Sn-based18 (20 to 1500 Pa) perovskite films reported in our previous work. The wide process window of this method might be beneficial for the large-scale manufacturing of lead-free perovskite films in the future. The grain size of the PHABiI4 films is between 100 nm and 400 nm. As shown in Fig. S3,† the film samples prepared at different pressures exhibit almost the same morphology, suggesting the good consistency of the gas pump treatment. This phenomenon is consistent with our previously reported work.40 The reason for this phenomenon may be attributed to the increase of grain size of the samples prepared at different pressures after heat treatment.46 Besides, there are many rod-like crystals existing in PHABiI4 films (see Fig. S3†). To explore this special phenomenon, we carried out EDS of rod-like crystals in the PHABiI4 film (see Fig. S5†). The obtained Bi/I atomic ratio (≈1:4) of the rod-like crystals is consistent with the stoichiometry of the area without rod-like crystals, suggesting the compositional uniformity of the films. Furthermore, we compared the morphology of the film samples with and without gas pump treatment. As shown in Fig. S4,† there are no rod-like crystals existing in the film without gas pump treatment. So, we speculate that the rod-like crystals in PHABiI4 films might be associated with the extremely high solvent evaporation rate of the gas pump treatment.18,40 The detailed mechanism of the rod-like crystals is not clear now. Therefore, more attention should be paid to the detailed mechanism of the rod-like crystals in the future.
Large-area and high-quality film fabrication techniques are essential for the development of lead-free perovskite photovoltaic technology. Up to now, it is still challenging to fabricate large-area (>20 cm2) and high-quality Bi-based perovskite films by solution-based deposition methods. So, we try to fabricate large-area (20.25 cm2) Bi-based perovskite films by conventional heat treatment and gas pump treatment. The PHABiI4 film prepared by heat treatment shows a rough and dim surface (Fig. 3a), while the gas pump processed sample exhibits an obvious mirror-like surface (Fig. 3b). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that large-area and high-quality Bi-based perovskite thin films exceeding 20 cm2 have been reported. The above-mentioned results suggest that gas-pump treatment is a powerful strategy for fabricating large-area and high-quality Bi-based perovskite thin films, which is vital for the scalable fabrication of Bi-based or other lead-free perovskite-based optoelectronic devices in the future.

To determine the absorption properties of the PHABiI4 film, ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption and transmittance spectra were recorded (see Fig. 4a and S6†). The PHABiI4 film shows strong distinct pre-edge absorption peaks at ∼2.7 eV, which might be related to the existence of excitons in this material (see Fig. 4a).31 From the corresponding Tauc plot of the PHABiI4 thin film in the inset of Fig. 4a, a band gap (Eg) of 2.14 eV is obtained for PHABiI4 assuming a direct Eg. If indirect Eg was instead assumed, an Eg of 2.03 eV would be obtained (Fig. S7†). Although this Bi-based perovskite is not suitable for single-junction photovoltaic devices, it might be used as a wide-bandgap absorber for multi-junction solar cells, as has been realized for CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskites (Eg = 2.26 eV).47 To further study the optical properties of the PHABiI4 material, room-temperature photoluminescence (PL) was determined (Fig. 4b). Here we observe that the PL peak is shifted relative to the absorption onset, which is similar to previously reported results for Sb-based perovskites.31 The PL peak (ca. 1.78 eV) was shifted 360 meV to lower energies away from the band edge at 2.14 eV, suggesting radiative recombination involving sub-band-gap states.31 We also note that the full width at half maximum of the PL spectrum was quite broad, which is similar to previously reported Bi-based perovskite materials.23,25 As shown in Fig. 4c, the absorption coefficient of the PHABiI4 film is 1.54 × 104 cm−1 for the most intense absorption at 510 nm, which is comparable to that of the MAPbI3 perovskite.

To further study the exciton recombination dynamics, transient PL decay data were obtained using a time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) setup. As shown in Fig. 4d, the raw data can be fitted well by a bi-exponential function, with a short lifetime of 0.3 ns (τ1) and a long lifetime of 3.5 ns (τ2), and the weight fractions are 58.04% (A1) and 41.96% (A2), respectively. The short lifetime might arise from the defect-induced nonradiative recombination, while the long lifetime might be attributed to the radiative recombination.48 The average charge carrier lifetime (τave) is calculated with the τi and Ai values from the fitted curve data (Fig. 4d) using the following equation:49,50  
The τave (1.64 ns = 0.3 ns × 58.04% + 3.5 ns × 41.96%) is longer than that of the Sn-based perovskite (MASnI3, 0.41 ns).51 During the early stages of research on this Bi-based material, the carrier lifetime (1.64 ns) was longer than the first-pass threshold value (1 ns) required for photovoltaic devices.25 Thus, PHABiI4 is worthy of being investigated as a promising photoelectric material in the future. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was performed to determine the Fermi energy (EF) and valence band energy (Ev) level of the PHABiI4 material. The EF was estimated to be −5.47 eV, acquired using the cutoff energy (Ecutoff) presented in the inset of Fig. 4e from the equation EF = 21.22 eV (He I) − Ecutoff. The linear extrapolation in Fig. 4e represents the value of Ev − EF, leading to an Ev of −6.44 eV. The conduction band energy (Ec) can be obtained by adding the Eg of the PHABiI4 material to Ev, which is calculated to be −4.30 eV. The energy band diagram of the PHABiI4 material is shown in Fig. 4f.
Inherent material stability toward moisture and heat is essential for the commercialization of perovskite-based optoelectronic devices. To study the moisture stability of the PHABiI4 material, we exposed a PHABiI4 sample continuously for 334 days to ambient air at 50–70% RH and recorded its XRD patterns (Fig. 5a and b). The sample for the moisture stability test was prepared by heat treatment, which is widely used in most lead-free perovskite materials (Cs3Bi2I9, MA3Bi2I9, AgBi2I7, C6H8NBiI4, C5H6NBiI4, PMA2CuBr4, and Cs2NaBiI6, see Table S1†). As shown in Fig. S8,† a slight improvement of the peak intensity was observed after 42 days, suggesting the enhancement in crystallinity. This phenomenon might be associated with Ostwald ripening52 or age-induced recrystallization53 reported in lead-based perovskite films. Besides, the color of the fresh film became slightly lighter after 334 days, which is consistent with the slight decrease of the peak intensity after 74, 108, 205 and 334 days. Despite this, the XRD patterns of the PHABiI4 film do not show additional reflections over this long period of time. In contrast, the MAPbI3 film is completely transformed into PbI2 after approximately 40 days (52% RH).35 Furthermore, the UV-vis spectra tests of the PHABiI4 films were carried out before and after storage in ambient air for 14 and 28 days (Fig. S9†); no obvious changes were observed, suggesting that the PHABiI4 material is humidity-stable. To compare with other lead-free halide perovskites, the ambient stability test results of lead-free halide perovskite materials reported in the literature are summarized (see Fig. 6 and Table S1†). To the best of our knowledge, this is the longest humidity stability reported to date for lead-free perovskite materials (see Fig. 6 and Table S1†). The remarkable long-term ambient stability of PHABiI4 might be related to the hydrophobic PHA groups preventing the intrusion of water molecules in high humidity environments, as reported for two-dimensional (2D) perovskite materials.34–36 The detailed mechanisms of stability for this material might be complex and more studies are needed in the future. As shown in Fig. 5c, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results show the beginning of weight loss at ∼184 °C, which means that PHABiI4-based solar cells could be used under actual working conditions, even though the device temperature exceeds 85 °C.54 These results clearly confirm the excellent moisture and heat stability of PHABiI4 films.

To evaluate the photovoltaic performance of the PHABiI4 perovskites, we fabricated solar cells with an architecture FTO/compact and mesoporous TiO2 + PHABiI4/P3HT/Au (Fig. S10†). In our study, P3HT is used as the hole transport material (HTM) instead of the frequently used Spiro-OMeTAD, which was previously used for the PMA2CuBr4 (ref. 34) and AgBi2I7 (ref. 55) perovskite materials. The reason for using P3HT in the PHABiI4-based solar cell is that 4-tert-butylpyridine (used as an additive in the Spiro-OMeTAD solution) dissolves the PHABiI4 layer.56 Our initial attempts to incorporate PHABiI4 into solar cells using this architecture obtained a moderate PCE of 0.78% (see Fig. S11†), which was comparable to the performance of other bismuth or antimony containing lead-free perovskite solar cells (see Table S2†). To exclude the contribution from the p-type P3HT polymer (a typical light-absorber in organic solar cells), we measured the J–V curve of the reference device without the PHABiI4 layer, which showed a low PCE of 0.03% (Fig. S11†). The low PCE achieved during this early stage of investigation of this material might be associated with the following two reasons: first, the low VOC (0.58 V) obtained for the device with PHABiI4 is possibly due to the use of c-TiO2 with disadvantageous energy levels, which may reduce the maximum voltage in the device. The Ec of PHABiI4 (−4.30 eV) is higher than that of TiO2 (−4.0 eV) (see Fig. S12†), which is not beneficial for photo-excited electron injection into n-type TiO2. Second, the fill factor (FF) of the device is very small (see Fig. S11†), which is similar to previously reported Bi-based solar cells.23 The FF represents how “easy” or how “difficult” it is to extract the photo-excited carriers out of a solar cell.57 The relatively short carrier lifetime (1.64 ns, Fig. 4d) of this Bi-based material might not be beneficial for carrier transportation and collection58 and will lower the FF.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we report the optoelectronic properties and stability of PHABiI4 perovskite materials. We demonstrate that the gas pump treatment technique is an eco-friendly, robust approach for producing dense and pinhole-free Bi-based perovskite films. Remarkably, we successfully fabricated a large-area (>20 cm2) PHABiI4 film, which is the largest Bi-based perovskite film ever reported. The PHABiI4 perovskite exhibits good solubility in ethanol, an eco-friendly solvent. Most importantly, the PHABiI4 material exhibits >330 days moisture stability, which is the longest humidity stability reported to date for lead-free perovskite materials. Our work provides a way to realize highly stable and lead-free perovskite materials for potential optoelectronic applications. Many future experimental and theoretical studies are needed to assess the full potential of this Bi-based perovskite material. We expect that this material may find its applications in LEDs, resistive switching memory, and photodetectors in the future.
Experimental section
Materials
All the chemicals were used as received, including BiI3 (bismuth iodide, 99.99%, Aladdin), absolute ethanol (99.5%, Aladdin), chlorobenzene (anhydrous, 99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, anhydrous, 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich), poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT, Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp), and C6H5NH3I (phenylammonium iodide, >99.5%, Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp). Mesoporous TiO2 (Dyesol, particle size ≈ 18 nm) paste was diluted with absolute ethanol (1:7 weight ratio). Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass (TEC7, 2.2 mm) was purchased from Ying Kou You Xuan Trade Co., Ltd (China). Stoichiometric C6H5NH3I (221.04 mg) and BiI3 (589.7 mg) were dissolved in 3 mL of absolute ethanol or DMF. Then, the dark red C6H5NH3BiI4 precursor solution (Fig. S13†) was stirred at 60 °C for 30 min.
Film fabrication
For the heat treatment, the precursor solution was dropped on the FTO substrates and spin coated at 2000 rpm for 30 s. For the gas pump treatment, the precursor solution was dropped on the FTO substrates and spin coated at 2000 rpm for 3 s. Subsequently, the sample was immediately transferred to a home-developed gas pump chamber34 with different chamber pressures, pumping the sample for 5 s. All perovskite films were fabricated and annealed at 100 °C for 15 min.
Materials characterization
XRD measurements were carried out on an Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα from 5 to 80° (2θ). The simulation of the crystalline structure was performed on the Material Studio platform. UV-vis and transmission spectra were measured for the PHABiI4 thin films spin-coated on the FTO substrate using a PerkinElmer Lambda 950 spectrophotometer. A transient fluorescence spectrometer (FLS980) was used for obtaining the transient PL decay curve and a 450 nm wavelength laser was used to excite the sample. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were carried out with a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi instrument, using monochromatic Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.7 eV). SEM tests were performed on a field-emission SEM (MIRA3 TESCAN). An SDT Q600 V20.5 Build 15 instrument was used for thermogravimetric analysis. The analysis was performed under a nitrogen atmosphere (flow rate 60 mL min−1), and an interval from 42 to 450 °C (ramp rate of 10 °C min−1) was studied. The samples for UV-vis and transmission spectroscopy, UPS, and long-term XRD tests were prepared by the most widely used heat treatment method.
Device fabrication and characterization
FTO substrates were cleaned by sonicating them sequentially in acetone, ethanol, and deionized water, each for 15 min, and then dried with nitrogen and treated in UV ozone for 30 min. A compact TiO2 layer was prepared according to our previous report.18,40 The meso-TiO2 solution was spin coated onto compact TiO2 at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 500 °C for 30 min. Then 0.3 M C6H5NH3BiI4 precursor in ethanol solution was dropped on the meso-TiO2 layer and spin coated at 2000 rpm for 3 s. Subsequently, the sample was immediately transferred to a gas pump chamber with 3000 Pa, pumping the sample for 5 s. Then the somewhat mirror-like dried Bi-based perovskite films were heated at 100 °C for 15 min. Next, P3HT in chlorobenzene (20 mg mL−1) was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a Au metal electrode was thermally evaporated. Photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices with an active area of 0.1 cm2 were recorded by using a source meter (2400, Keithley) under AM 1.5 G 100 mW cm−2 illumination using a Peccell Technologies PEC-L01 solar simulator. The devices were tested by forward (from −0.2 to 1.2 V) voltage scanning with a sweep speed of 0.05 V s−1.
