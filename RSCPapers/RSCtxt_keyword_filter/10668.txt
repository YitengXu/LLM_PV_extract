    , Accepted 20th November 2013First published on 26th November 2013AbstractPZT film of 300 nm thickness was deposited on tin indium oxide (ITO) coated quartz by a sol–gel method. Four metal electrodes, such as Pt, Au, Cu and Ag, were used as top electrodes deposited on the same PZT film by sputtering at room temperature. In ITO–PZT–Ag and ITO–PZT–Au structures, the visible light (400–700 nm) can be absorbed partially by a PZT film, and the maximum efficiency of photoelectric conversion of the ITO–PZT–Ag structure was enhanced to 0.42% (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G), which is about 15 times higher than that of the ITO–PZT–Pt structure. Numerical simulations show that the natural random roughness of polycrystalline-PZT–metal interface can offer a possibility of coupling between the incident photons and SPs at the metal surface. The coincidence between the calculated SP properties and the measured EQE spectra reveals the SP origin of the photovoltaic enhancement in these ITO–PZT–metal structures, and the improved photocurrent output is caused by the enhanced optical absorption in the PZT region near the metal surface, rather than by the direct charge–transfer process between two materials.
1. Introduction
Recently, photovoltaic effects of the ferroelectric films, such as Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT, including PbTiO3 and (Pb,La)(Zr,Ti)O3),1–6 BiFeO3 (BFO),7–13 (Bi,Nd)Ti3O12 (ref. 14 and 15) and Bi2FeCrO6,16 are currently receiving a great deal of interest as a promising alternative to conventional photonic and photovoltaic devices. Attention has been focused on the influence of interface effects,17–22 crystal orientation,23 domain wall,9,24 and grain boundaries or defects.25–28 The photovoltaic effect of ferroelectric films shows an impressive characteristic and potential application prospect such as a huge open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 15 V.9,24 However, the main drawback of this intriguing effect is that only a tiny short-circuit photocurrent (JSC) is generated because these highly insulating ferroelectric materials have a typical large band gap, for example, PZT’s is about 3.6 eV which can only absorb the ultraviolet light (UV) with the wavelength from 300 to 380 nm.29 Although the band gap of BFO is about 2.7 eV, which is lower than that of PZT, BFO can only absorb the light with a wavelength below 450 nm.17 In our recent works, some semiconductors with narrow band gap such as Cu2O (2.7 eV)29 and Ag2O (1.2 eV)30 were introduced into the PZT film to form a new type of solar cell, which just show a weak absorption of visible light. In these works, the short-circuit current (JSC) of PZT film was enhanced greatly at the cost of remnant polarization, which was indicated by the decrease of the open-circuit voltage (VOC).
Many studies4,15,18,29 of photovoltaic mechanism in the electrode–PZT–electrode structures have revealed that the photocurrent is determined mainly by the bottom Schottky barrier (Ebi-bottom) at the interface between the bottom electrode and PZT film because the value of the top Schottky barrier (Ebi-top) is far lower than that of Ebi-bottom and these two Schottky barriers are back-to-back, as shown in Fig. 1a. Since the direction of the Ebi-bottom is pointed to the bottom tin indium oxide (ITO) electrode, the UV light-induced holes (hBB) are expelled to the bottom ITO electrode and the UV light-induced electrons (eBB) are drifted to the top metal one.29 Most of the eBBs at the top interface will be expelled back to the PZT film due to the existance of the Ebi-top, which limits the photocurrent of PZT film. The works of Harshan2 and Su31 show that the top electrodes with a low work function, such as Al (4.2 eV) or Mg (3.7 eV), can enhance effectively the photovoltaic output of the metal–ferroelectric–metal structures, which is attributed to the reduction of the Schottky barrier height at the top metal–ferroelectric interface. However, these improvements in photovoltaic output are still restricted to enhancing the band-to-band absorption (UV light) of the PZT film.

(a) hBB and eBB are the UV light-induced charges due to the band-to-band absorption of PZT film. (b) Top Schottky barrier height was reduced greatly due to low work function of top electrode that is a good material for SP applications in the visible range. The visible-light induced charges (hSP and eSP) can also be separated by the bottom Schottky barrier. 
Surface plasmon (SP) structures (mainly Ag or Au nanoparticles incorporated in or on semiconductors) can improve the photovoltaic performance of solar cells in the visible range, which has been verified by many previous works.32 SP refers to the collective excitation of conduction electrons at a metal–dielectric interface. The associated electromagnetic field distributions in the vicinity of the interface will exhibit strong confinement and enhancement, as well as sensitivity to the geometry of the metallodielectric structures and the optical constants of the materials. For thin film solar cells based on semiconductors with a narrow band gap, such as Si, GaAs and CdSe–Si heterostructures,33,34 researchers usually adopted properly engineered SPs to couple and trap the incident light into the semiconductor film and enhance optical absorption, which leads to the increased production rate of the electron–hole pairs, particularly in the near-field region of the semiconductor–metal interface. Usually, SPs can perform efficiently only in an artificial periodic metal structure35 or a well-designed nanoparticle metal–semiconductor interface,33,34 which undoubtedly increases the technical complexity and the process cost.
For solar cells based on the PZT film with a band gap of about 3.5 eV, no studies of their photovoltaic performance with SPs have been reported, at least to our knowledge. But both experiment and analytical calculation have shown that SPs in the visible band will occur when Au nanoparticles are embedded in the PZT matrix36 or when periodic Au structures are introduced,35 just like what happens when these nanostructured metals are incorporated into other semiconductors. In this paper, we report a new mechanism in a simple structure that can improve the visible-light absorption of a PZT film, as shown in Fig. 1b. The PZT film of 300 nm thickness was deposited on the ITO (150 nm, ESI Fig. S1,† and the detailed experimental process can be found elsewhere29) coated quartz by sol–gel method. Ag was deposited on the PZT film by sputtering at room temperature as a top electrode with a low work function (4.26 eV) that is close to that of the Al metal and leads to a low Ebi-top (To simplify, Ebi-top is neglected in Fig. 1b). Meanwhile, Ag has been extensively investigated as a good candidate for SP applications in the visible range due to its minimal loss and high stability.32 The visible-light induced charges (hSP and eSP) can also be separated efficiently by the Ebi-bottom if the Ebi-top is as low as possible. In the ITO–PZT–Ag structure, the visible light (400–550 nm) can be absorbed partially by a PZT film, and the maximum efficiency of photoelectric conversion was enhanced to 0.42% (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G), which is about 15 times higher than that of the ITO–PZT–Pt structure. Au is another candidate for SP applications, which has a high work function (5.1 eV).35 Copper (Cu, work function 4.56 eV) exhibits an SP resonance similar to that of Au in numerical simulations, but easily suppressed by oxidation in experiments.37,38 Platinum (Pt) with a highest work function (5.6 eV) is among the poor materials to support SP due to is heavy damping.39 In our experiments, Pt, Au and Cu metal electrodes were deposited on the same PZT film at room temperature for the comparative studies. Note that no artificial nanostructures such as metallic nanoparticles or periodic metallic structures are introduced deliberately in our experiments. However, it is interesting that our calculations will show the natural random roughness of polycrystalline-PZT–metal interface can also offer a possibility of the coupling between the incident photons and SPs at the metal surface.
2. Experimental
PZT films were deposited by a sol–gel method. The experimental details can be found in our previous work.29 Metal Pt, Au, Cu and Ag dots (diameter and thickness of these dot electrodes were about 300 μm and 80 nm, respectively) as top electrodes were fabricated on the same PZT film by sputtering at room temperature. Polarization–voltage (P–V) hysteresis loops were examined using a precision ferroelectric analyzer from Radiant Technology. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PZT film with Pt, Au, Cu and Ag top electrodes were recorded by a 91160 Newport under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). Time-dependent open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current (JSC) under the illumination of the incident light with various wavelengths were recorded by Keithley 6517 A. The surface morphologies of the film were investigated using a NTMDT Solver P47-PRO scanning probe microscope operating in the contact atomic force microscope (AFM) mode. EQE (external quantum efficiency) was measured by IPCE/QE 200 Newport within the wavelengths of 300–750 nm. UV-visible light transmission and absorption characteristics were measured by JASCO UV/VIS 550.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 2 shows the polarization hysteresis loops of ITO–PZT–Pt, ITO–PZT–Au, ITO–PZT–Cu and ITO–PZT–Ag structures. Because four types top electrodes were deposited on the same PZT film, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2, all structures have the same saturation polarization. However, the remnant polarization (2Pr) of ITO–PZT–Pt, ITO–PZT–Au, ITO–PZT–Cu and ITO–PZT–Ag structures is 54.6, 51.8, 48.0 and 42.3 μC cm−2, respectively, influenced by the work function of top electrodes. Among four top electrodes, only the work function (4.26 eV) of Ag electrode is far lower than that (4.6 eV (ref. 29)) of PZT film, so, more injected charges may be introduced into the PZT film when a poling voltage was applied on ITO–PZT–Ag sample. The 2Pr of ITO–PZT–Ag is lower a little than those of other three structures, which is mainly attributed to more injected charges in ITO–PZT–Ag structure due to the low work function of Ag electrode, as a result, partially polarization trapping.40,41

The photovoltaic output of ITO–PZT–metal structure is mainly determined by the bottom Schottky barrier of ITO–PZT interface (Ebi-bottom) and modulated by the polarization switching (ESI Fig. S2†).29,42 When the PZT film is remnant polarization-up state, the direction of the depolarization field due to the aliment polarization is the same as that of the Ebi-bottom, so, a maximum photovoltaic output can be obtained. Fig. 3 displays the representative current density–voltage (J–V) characteristic of ITO–PZT–Pt, ITO–PZT–Au, ITO–PZT–Cu and ITO–PZT–Ag structures, respectively, recorded under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination when PZT film is remnant polarization-up state. The open circuit voltage (VOC), short circuit current (JSC), fill factor (FF) and photoelectric transformation efficiency (η) of all structures are listed in ESI Table S1.† Except the ITO–PZT–Ag structure, the VOC increases with the decrease of the work function of metal electrode, which can be attributed to the decrease of the top Schottky barrier height,2,31 considering these three samples have a similar Ebi-bottom and remnant polarization. The VOC of ITO–PZT–Ag structure is lower a little than that of ITO–PZT–Cu structure, which is due to the decrease of the remnant polarization of ITO–PZT–Ag structure. It is interesting that the ITO–PZT–Ag structure has the largest JSC among those of four structures. Harshan2 reported that by using aluminum, a low work function metal (4.2 eV), as top electrode, the photocurrent magnitude can be enhanced about 3 times higher than that using Pt as top electrode in La doped PZT film. However, the work function of Ag (4.26 eV) is comparable to that of Al, the JSC of ITO–PZT–Ag structure is about 12 times than that of ITO–PZT–Pt structure. Furthermore, the JSC of ITO–PZT–Au structure are about 2 times higher than that of ITO–PZT–Cu while the work function of Au is higher than that of Cu. Obviously, the JSC is not linearly dependent of the work function of top metal electrode, which cannot be explained only by the decrease of the work function of top electrode.

We tried to add different filters between the sample and the simulated sunlight source in order to change the wavelength and the power of incident light. The filters were named by K9, JB420 and CB550, respectively, and the transmission spectra of these filters can be found in ESI Fig. S3.† The absorption wavelength edges of K9, JB420 and CB550 are 285, 400 and 555 nm, respectively and the powers of transmitted lights were 95, 86 and 40 mW cm−2, respectively. Fig. 4 shows time-dependent JSC of four structures illuminated under the incident light with different wavelength and power. It seems reasonable that the JSC decreases with the incident light power, as shown in Fig. 4. When the incident light includes only the visible light (JB420 and CB550 filters), it is easy understandable that the JSC is close to zero in both ITO–PZT–Pt and ITO–PZT–Cu structures, as shown in Fig. 4a and c, because the band gap of PZT is about 3.6 eV, which is almost transparent for visible light. However, in the ITO–PZT–Ag structure, a JSC (about 0.7 mA cm−2) can be observed when the sample is lighted only under the visible light (>400 nm), as shown in Fig. 4d. Furthermore, in the ITO–PZT–Au structure as shown in Fig. 4b, a steady JSC is still obtained when the wavelength of incident visible light is longer than 550 nm. Pintilie19 and Takahashi43 have reported a sub-bandgap absorption in epitaxial PZT or PbTiO3 films, which can result in a very tiny visible light-induced photocurrent. Obviously, this mechanism of the sub-bandgap absorption cannot be used to explain the visible absorption dependent on the metal electrode.

Comparatively, the JSC of all structures illuminated under a simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2, AM1.5G) were also shown here (black line). 

Fig. 5 shows the EQE (external quantum efficiency) of PZT film with metal Pt, Au, Cu and Ag top electrodes when PZT film is as-grown state (excluding the effect of remnant polarization). There is a strong peak at the wavelength of about 350 nm in every EQE curve, which is corresponding to the band-to-band absorption of PZT film. Obviously, the lower the work function of top metal electrode is, the stronger the peak becomes, which has been verified by other works that a low work function of metal electrode leads to a small Schottky barrier of top interface (Ebi-top) between PZT and metal electrode.2 The EQE results of all structures are accordance with the results shown in Fig. 4. In the ITO–PZT–Pt and ITO–PZT–Cu structures, the photocurrent is close to zero at the visible band (400–750 nm). In the ITO–PZT–Ag structure, the visible light with a shorter wavelength (400–550 nm) can lead to the photocurrent, which cannot be attributed obviously to the band-to-band absorption of PZT film. Similarly, the response at the visible band (500–700 nm) in ITO–PZT–Au structure is not related to the band gap of PZT film.

To compare the measured photovoltaic enhancement and the SP properties of these structures, we reconstructed the PZT–metal electrode interface based on the AFM data of the polycrystalline PZT surface, and performed a finite element analysis of the optical properties of rough interface using the well-known commercial software Comsol Multiphysics. Fig. 6 shows the interface adopted in our simulations, of the size 1 × 1 μm, with the height distribution obtained by interpolating the AFM data (the actual 2-demetional AFM picture is shown here as a contrast, and the 3-demetional AFM picture can be seen in ESI Fig. S4†). The regions above and below the interface are filled with PZT and electrode metals respectively, as shown in Fig. 6c. In the numerical simulations, the PZT–metal interface is illuminated from ITO electrode by a plane wave at normal incidence with a vacuum wavelength λ0 ranging from 350 nm to 750 nm. The spectral response of the refractive index (n) and the extinction coefficient (k) of PZT film are measured by the method of spectroscopic ellipsometry, as shown in ESI Fig. S5.† The dispersion relations of metallic electrodes are calculated by using a conventional Drude model for SP materials.39,44

Fig. 7 gives the absorption spectra of PZT surface with the Ag, Au, Cu and Pt electrodes obtained in our numerical simulations, compared with the results when the interface between PZT and the electrodes is smooth purposely. It is shown that the roughness of the interface almost has no effect on the absorption of Pt electrode. On the contrary, the apparent absorption peaks around 520 nm and 610 nm are respectively observed for the Ag and Au electrodes with rough surface. A weaker absorption peak presents at about 600 nm for the Cu electrodes compared with that of Au electrode. For all four electrodes, there are no any absorption enhancement in the visible band (400–750 nm) when the surface of PZT film is smoothed purposely.
 Fig. 7  Calculated absorption spectra of PZT surface with the Ag (black, left), Au (red, left), Cu (red, right) and Pt (black, right) electrodes. Solid: rough surface; hollow: smooth surface. 
Furthermore, a dramatic increase of electromagnetic field near the metal surface occurs around these absorption peaks. Fig. 8a–c shows the calculated distributions of field enhancement factor |E|2/E02 just outside the rough surface of Ag, Au and Cu electrodes for incident wavelength at 520 nm, 610 nm and 600 nm respectively. As contrasts, the results for smooth surfaces are illustrated in Fig. 8e–g. It is clearly shown that the near fields associated with the resonance peaks in the absorption spectra (Fig. 7) are strongly enhanced at rough surfaces. Both the field distributions and the absorption features verify the occurrence of SP resonances at the rough PZT–(Ag, Au, Cu) interface, particularly for the Ag electrode where the strongest resonance peak is observed and the surface field is enhanced up to nearly two orders of magnitude. The maximum surface field enhancement factor at the rough Ag surface is about 639.0. The resonance effects for the Au and Cu electrodes are weaker, with the maximum surface field enhancement factor obtained as 66.5 and 44.1 respectively. For platinum, no obvious near-field enhancement is observed for any incident wavelength except for a slight lightning-rod effect at several sharp tips of the rough surface (Fig. 8d).45 It seems that scattering from the surface roughness has destroyed the weak SP effect in platinum, resulting in the disappearance of the absorption peak and the field concentration.

(a) and (e) Ag electrodes for the incident light with a wavelength 520 nm for rough and smooth surface, respectively; (b) and (f) Au electrodes for that 610 nm; (c) and (g) Cu electrodes for that 600 nm; (d) and (h) Pt electrodes for that 600 nm. 
The above results from numerical simulations clearly show how the surface roughness of polycrystalline PZT film in our experiments couple the incident light with localized SPs of Ag, Au and Cu electrodes. Our calculation absorption spectra of PZT surface for the Ag, Au and Pt electrodes are used to explain well the photovoltaic performance of PZT film illuminated by the visible light with different wavelength. It is interesting to note that in our experiments the “good” electrodes (Ag or Au) for the EQE enhancement in the visible range are also those “good” for the excitation of surface plasmon resonances. Previous work38 shows that Cu is easily to be oxidized at the interface where sufficient oxygen atoms are provided by PZT, which can seriously destroy the excitation of its weak SP resonances due to roughness.
It should be mentioned that the actual EQE spectrum (400–750 nm) of PZT film with either Ag or Au electrode shows a blue shift, compared with that of the calculated absorption spectrum. Previous studies of Au particles embedded in PZT have shown that the positions of SP resonances are very sensitive to the refractive index of PZT just surrounding the metallic particles.35,36 A change of the refractive index of surrounding PZT regions by 0.1 may result in a shift of the resonance peak by 10–20 nm.36 The value of the refractive index of PZT adopted in the above simulations has been taken from the measured results for the whole PZT films, which is certainly larger than the actual PZT refractive index near the PZT–metal interface since this region usually contains more vacancies. ESI Fig. S6 and S7† show the calculated blue shifts of the absorption peaks of Ag and Au electrode when the refractive index of PZT in simulations is decreased.
Note that SP-assisted photovoltaic effects in broad-gap semiconductors, such as dye-sensitized solar cells or photocatalysis system based on TiO2 (the gap is about 3.2 eV),46–48 are usually attributed to the charge transfer process at the semiconductor–metal surface. The observed photocurrent in the visible range was usually explained by that the plasmon-induced electrons in the metal are driven by the field of Schottky barrier at the metal–semiconductor interface to drift into the adjoining semiconductor. According to this mechanism, an increased photo current due to SP should be observed if the height of Schottky barrier is enhanced. Theoretically, the height of Schottky barrier at the PZT–metal interface is determined by the difference of work function between PZT film and metal layer. In fact, the height of Schottky barrier is affected largely by the space charge at the interface, especially when the metal electrode is deposited at room temperature, which has been verified by many previous works.22,49 Post-annealing can effectively enhance the height of Schottky barrier at PZT–metal interface.22 In order to qualitatively check the influence of Schottky barrier height on the photocurrent due to the SP, we annealed the ITO–PZT–Ag structure at 500 °C in air for 10 min. Fig. 9 shows that the EQE at the wavelength of 350 nm, which corresponds to the band-to-band absorption of PZT film, decreases after the Ag electrode is annealed. It means the value of top Schottky barrier at the PZT–Ag interface increases. The bottom Schottky barrier height of ITO–PZT interface is reckoned usually as a constant, which is almost not influenced by the post annealing.22,49 It is interesting that the EQE at the visible band (400–550 nm) decrease rapidly when the Ag dots were annealed at 500 °C for 10 min. Similar phenomenon can also be found in the ITO–PZT–Au structure (ESI Fig. S8†). Obviously, the increased Schottky barrier height of PZT–metal interface may impede the transport of electron–hole pairs due to SP, as illustrated and discussed in the ESI Fig. S9.† We suggest that the conventional charge-transfer mechanism cannot account for the SP-induced photocurrent in a PZT film although PZT is also reckoned as a semiconductor with a large band gap (about 3.6 eV). The photocurrents observed in the visible range in our ITO–PZT–metal structures are contributed from the light-induced electron–holes excited by the enhanced near-fields at the PZT surface rather than direct charge transfer from the metallic electrode, which has been verified in our numeric simulations. Our model can also be used to explain well the low value of the EQE at the visible band at the ITO–PZT–Ag or ITO–PZT–Au structure.

Blue line shows the EQE of ITO–PZT–Ag structure (Ag dots were unannealed), which is the same as that in Fig. 5. Wine line represents that of ITO–PZT–Ag structure, where Ag dots were annealed at 500 °C for 10 min. 
4. Conclusions
In summary, SPs were introduced successfully into the inartificial surface of the PZT film by deposited top Ag and Au electrodes without a complex technique and high cost, which can greatly increase the photovoltaic of the PZT film deposited on the ITO–quartz substrate by enhancing the visible light absorption due to SPs. The results from numerical simulations clearly show that the surface roughness of the polycrystalline PZT film in our experiments can couple the visible incident light with localized SPs of Ag and Au electrodes. The experimental results shows that the Schottky barrier of the PZT–metal interface impedes the transport of visible light-induced charges due to SPs when the photocurrent is majorly determined by the bottom Schottky barrier of ITO–PZT interface. This work clarifies the issue that the light-induced charges due to SPs in a semiconductor with a large band gap occur at the surface of the semiconductor other than that of the metal materials, and points out a new method to improve the photoelectric transformation efficiency of solar cells based on the ferroelectric films.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Illustration of the separation of photoinduced electrons and holes in ITO–PZT–metal structure. (a) hBB and eBB are the UV light-induced charges due to the band-to-band absorption of PZT film. (b) Top Schottky barrier height was reduced greatly due to low work function of top electrode that is a good material for SP applications in the visible range. The visible-light induced charges (hSP and eSP) can also be separated by the bottom Schottky barrier.	 

 	Fig. 2  Polarization hysteresis loops of ITO–PZT–Pt, ITO–PZT–Au, ITO–PZT–Cu and ITO–PZT–Ag structures. The inset in Figure is the sketch map of all structures.	 

 	Fig. 3  Photovoltaic current voltage (PVIV) curves of ITO–PZT–Pt, ITO–PZT–Au, ITO–PZT–Cu and ITO–PZT–Ag structures illuminated under a simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G) when PZT film was in remnant polarization-up states (depolarization field directed to bottom ITO electrode).	 

 	Fig. 4  Time-dependent short-circuit photocurrent (JSC) of (a) ITO–PZT–Pt, (b) ITO–PZT–Au, (c) ITO–PZT–Cu and (d) ITO–PZT–Ag structures illuminated under the lights with different wavelength, which were realized by using the filters K9 (green line), JB420 (blue line) and CB550 (red line). Comparatively, the JSC of all structures illuminated under a simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2, AM1.5G) were also shown here (black line).	 

 	Fig. 5  External quantum efficient (EQE) of ITO–PZT–Pt (black), ITO–PZT–Au (red), ITO–PZT–Cu (green) and ITO–PZT–Ag (blue) structures illuminated under the monochromatic light with the wavelength from 300 nm to 750 nm when PZT film was in polarization-up state.	 

 	Fig. 6  Height distribution (a) of the interface in the simulations from the AFM data (b) of the polycrystalline PZT film. (c) Rough PZT–metal interface adopted in simulations. The scales of x, y and z axes are 1 μm, 1 μm and 50 nm, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 7  Calculated absorption spectra of PZT surface with the Ag (black, left), Au (red, left), Cu (red, right) and Pt (black, right) electrodes. Solid: rough surface; hollow: smooth surface.	 

 	Fig. 8  Calculated distributions of field enhancement factor |E|2/E02 just above the surface of metallic electrodes. (a) and (e) Ag electrodes for the incident light with a wavelength 520 nm for rough and smooth surface, respectively; (b) and (f) Au electrodes for that 610 nm; (c) and (g) Cu electrodes for that 600 nm; (d) and (h) Pt electrodes for that 600 nm.	 

 	Fig. 9  External quantum efficient (EQE) of ITO–PZT–Ag structures illuminated under the light with the wavelength between 300 nm and 750 nm when PZT film was in polarization-up state. Blue line shows the EQE of ITO–PZT–Ag structure (Ag dots were unannealed), which is the same as that in Fig. 5. Wine line represents that of ITO–PZT–Ag structure, where Ag dots were annealed at 500 °C for 10 min.
