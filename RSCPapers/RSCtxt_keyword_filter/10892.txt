    , Accepted 4th January 2018First published on 10th January 2018AbstractWe report on a simple one-step solution processing strategy to fabricate new stable mixed cation/mixed halide (5-AVA)xMA1−xPbI3−y(BF4)y perovskite solar cells. The results showed that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the optimized mixed (5-AVA)0.034MA0.966PbI2.95(BF4)0.05 perovskite solar cells was substantially increased to 15.5% with a remarkably high VOC of 0.97 V. We have analyzed different mixed perovskites focusing on the characterization of the charge recombination by means of intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy. In addition, our study discloses that the incorporation of MABF4 into the (5-AVA)0.034MA0.966PbI3 perovskite helps to reduce the charge recombination in the mixed perovskite cells, thus improving the open circuit voltage of the device. Furthermore, the new mixed perovskite was demonstrated to produce high-quality perovskite crystals and enhance the conductivity of the mixed perovskite.
Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites have recently emerged as a new class of light absorbers, demonstrating exceptional progress in the performance of solar cells, due to their direct band gap, high absorption coefficient, long balanced carrier diffusion length and high charge carrier mobility.1–3 A certified efficiency now exceeding 22%4 has been obtained since their first application in solar cells in 2009.5 The attractive material properties and a simple versatile synthesis method have allowed halide perovskites to be extremely promising for the next-generation photovoltaics. With the demand for low-cost and simple scale-up processes, the hole-conductor-free printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells (MPSCs) using the carbon counter electrode (CE) were reported in 2013.6 Subsequently, a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.8% was achieved, when MAPbI3 was mixed with 5-ammonium valeric acid iodide (5-AVAI).7 Since then, many efforts have been devoted to achieving high-performance MPSCs.8–13
Although the long-term stability (>1000 hours in ambient air under full sunlight) was achieved by utilizing mixed-cation perovskites (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3,7 the PCEs of the MPSCs are less than satisfactory compared with the rapid progress of the conventional devices. In particular, the mesoscopic TiO2 and CE layers are usually separated by an ∼2 μm thick inert ZrO2. The large separated distance challenges the charge transportation and aggravates charge recombination within the device,14 which hinders the further improvement of the device performance by decreasing the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current density (JSC).4 This is because there are many point defects such as vacancies and interstitials in MAPbI3 perovskites.4,15 The 5-AVA templating created (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3 perovskite crystals with a lower defect concentration and better pore filling, which helped to obtain stable devices with high JSC.7 However, the VOC of such cells remained low due to a severe charge recombination.
To date, compositional engineering of a mixed cation/mixed halide perovskite is one of the most effective methods to fabricate perovskite solar cells (PSCs), especially for the mixed cation/mixed halide (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3)x perovskites yielding a high PCE over 20%.16–18 The use of mixed cations and halides in PSCs can achieve higher performance, increased stability and enhanced charge carrier transport. Mostly, the mixed (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3)x perovskites were reported for a planar heterojunction structure formed by a spin-coating method. There were few reports of the mixed (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3)x perovskites formed by a one-step solution processing strategy used for mesoscopic structure solar cells. This is because FAPbI3 possesses two polymorphs: FAPbI3 crystallized to a yellow hexagonal nonperovskite phase (δ-FAPbI3) at room temperature and a black trigonal perovskite phase (α-FAPbI3) at higher temperatures (∼150 °C).19–21 Furthermore, it is more difficult to form the α-FAPbI3 perovskite in mesoscopic structure solar cells due to the altered crystallization behavior when in contact with a high surface-area mesoporous TiO2 scaffold.22,23 Therefore, a further study on the mixed perovskites fabricated by the simple method for MPSCs is necessary. Another study suggested that high-performance MPSCs were obtained by using a mixed anion perovskite MAPbI3−x(BF4)x instead of typical MAPbI3.14 The higher efficiency of MAPbI3−x(BF4)x cells compared with the MAPbI3 perovskite was attributed to the improved hole conductivity and charge carrier concentration of the mixed perovskite. Such merits of compositional engineering of the perovskite materials prompted us to fabricate stable and high-performance MPSCs.
In this work, we demonstrated a new mixed cation/mixed halide (5-AVA)0.034MA0.966PbI2.95(BF4)0.05 perovskite to fabricate high-performance MPSCs. The devices were fabricated by the simple one-step solution processing strategy at 50 °C. By the incorporation of MABF4 into the (5-AVA)0.034MA0.966PbI3 perovskite precursor solution, high-performance MPSCs with high VOC were obtained. We used different electrochemical techniques to characterize the devices, such as intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) as well as time-integrated and time-resolved PL, providing an understanding of the mechanisms of recombination and electron transport that control the performance in devices. We found that the mixed cation/mixed halide (5-AVA)0.034MA0.966PbI2.95(BF4)0.05 perovskites could alleviate carrier recombination and enhance charge carrier extraction at the perovskite and charge collection layer interfaces.
Experimental
Materials and sample preparation
Lead iodide (PbI2), 5-aminopentanoic acid (5-AVA) and γ-butyrolactone (GBL) were purchased from Acros Organics and used without further purification. MAI, MABF4 and 5-AVAI were synthesized according to the literature.7,14 5-AVABF4 was synthesized as follows: tetrafluoroboric acid (HBF4) (50% in water) together with 5-aminopentanoic acid was added with a mole ratio of 1:1 into a round-bottom flask and stirred in the ice bath for 2 h. After that, the remaining liquid was evaporated on a rotavapor at 50 °C. The precipitate was washed three times with diethyl ether and dried in a vacuum drying oven. The ABX-1 precursor solution was prepared as follows: 1.844 g PbI2, 0.614 g MAI and 0.034 g 5-AVAI were dissolved in 3.3 ml γ-butyrolactone and then stirred at 50 °C overnight. The ABX-3 precursor solution was prepared in the same manner, except that 5% MAI was replaced by MABF4.
Device fabrication
An FTO conducting glass was etched with a laser to form desired electrode patterns before being ultrasonically cleaned with detergent solution, deionized water and ethanol for 15 min, respectively. A compact TiO2 layer was then deposited on the FTO-coated glass by spray pyrolysis deposition at 450 °C using a titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution diluted in ethanol. After cooling to RT (25 °C), a 600 nm-thick mesoporous TiO2 layer, a 2.5 μm-thick ZrO2 spacer layer, and a 12 μm carbon layer were subsequently screen-printed on the substrates layer by layer. The TiO2 layer and ZrO2 layer were sintered at 500 °C for 30 min, and the carbon layer was sintered at 400 °C for 30 min, forming the mesoporous triple-layer-based scaffold. After cooling down to RT, the triple layer was infiltrated with perovskite solution via drop coating and annealed at 50 °C for one hour. All the procedures above were performed in an air atmosphere.
Characterization
Photocurrent density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured with a Keithley Model 2400 digital source meter and an AM 1.5G filter (Oriel, model 91192) giving an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 using a Newport Oriel PV reference cell (model 91150V). A black mask with a circular aperture (0.10 cm2), smaller than the size of the device active area (∼0.8 cm2), was applied on top of the cell. The scan rate was 0.25 V s−1 and the scan directions were both forward (short-circuit to open-circuit) and reverse (open-circuit to short-circuit) scan. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a 150 W xenon lamp (Oriel) fitted with a monochromator (Cornerstone 74004) as a monochromatic light source. The XRD spectra were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray Diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The UV-visible spectra of the perovskite films on the TiO2/FTO-coated glass were measured using a PerkinElmer Lambda 950 spectrophotometer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed with a field emission SEM (FEI Nova Nano SEM 450). The steady-state photoluminescence was characterized on a LabRAM HR800 (Horiba Jobin Yvon) with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm.
Results and discussion
As reported, the 5-AVA templating helps to produce high-quality mixed-cation perovskite crystals in stable MPSCs. To improve VOC of the MPSCs, we incorporated both 5-AVA and BF4− into the MAPbI3 perovskite to create new mixed cation/mixed anion (5-AVA)xMA1−xPbI3−x(BF4)x perovskites for the MPSCs. For the reference device infiltrated with (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3 perovskites, the optimum mole ratio of 5-AVAI was 3% to 5%, according to a previous report.7 In this study, the mole ratio of 5-AVAI was 3.5% for all reference devices. We first tried to introduce BF4− by incorporating 5-AVABF4 (3.5%) into MAPbI3 precursor solution to obtain the mixed cation/mixed (5-AVA)0.034MA0.966PbI2.966(BF4)0.034 perovskite solar cells but found no big change compared to the control device. The BF4− was then introduced using MABF4 instead. So, the concentration of 5-AVA and BF4− can be tuned separately. The optimum mole ratio of MABF4 was 5% according to our results. In this work, the MAPbI3 was mixed with 5-AVAI and MABF4, 5-AVABF4 or 5-AVAI, which was in form of (5-AVA)0.034MA0.966PbI2.95(BF4)0.05, (5-AVA)0.034MA0.966PbI2.966(BF4)0.034 and (5-AVA)0.034MA0.966PbI3, respectively. For convenience, we denote (5-AVA)0.034(MA)0.966PbI3 as ABX-1, (5-AVA)0.034MA0.966PbI2.966(BF4)0.034 as ABX-2 and (5-AVA)0.034MA0.966PbI2.95(BF4)0.05 as ABX-3 in the present and forthcoming sections.

Fig. 1a illustrates the schematic structure of the MPSCs in this study. In this triple-layer device, mesoporous TiO2, ZrO2 and CE films are screen-printed on an FTO glass substrate layer by layer. We used mesoporous TiO2 as the transparent n-type component. For the device without a hole-conducting layer, the perovskite produced by a drop-casting method integrated both the light absorber and the hole conductor. Particularly, we utilized a low-cost and easy-processed mesoporous graphite/carbon black counter electrode (CE) that acts as a hole extraction layer. Fig. 1b shows the cross-sectional image of FTO/TiO2/ZrO2/CE layers infiltrated with the ABX-3 perovskite for a complete device. The thicknesses of the triple mesoscopic layers (TiO2, ZrO2 and carbon counter) were about 0.6, 2.5 and 12 μm, respectively. Although several factors were found to affect the performance of the MPSCs, one of the key determinants of solar cell performance is the limited pore-filling of the mesoporous TiO2. Notably, most of the mesopores of the TiO2/ZrO2 double layer were well infiltrated with the mixed ABX-3 perovskite crystals. The homogeneous distribution of the mixed perovskite allows us to obtain high-performance devices.

To investigate the effect of different mixed perovskites on the properties and performance of the solar cells, the photocurrent density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured and IPCE measurements were performed, and they are illustrated in Fig. 2. The corresponding parameters are summarized in Table 1. The J–V curves measured under simulated AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 were scanned both forward (short-circuit to open-circuit) and reverse (open-circuit to short-circuit) with a rate of 0.25 V s−1. Fig. 2a shows the J–V characteristics of the champion devices using the ABX-1, ABX-2 or ABX-3 perovskite. The reference device fabricated with the mixed ABX-1 perovskite exhibited a PCE of 13.4%, with a VOC of 920 mV, a JSC of 22.37 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.65. Better performance was achieved for ABX-2, resulting in a VOC of 940 mV, a JSC of 23.57 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.67, yielding a PCE of 14.8%. Based on the mixed ABX-3 perovskite, a remarkably PCE of 15.5% was achieved in the reverse scan, with a VOC of 970 mV, a JSC of 24.37 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.66. Fig. 2b shows the J–V curves of the champion device based on the mixed ABX-3 perovskite and the corresponding parameters are summarized in Table 2. The results show that the VOC of the ABX-3 perovskite device has significantly improved compared with that of the ABX-1 perovskite based device. Meanwhile, the JSC of the ABX-3 based device has slightly improved. The UV-vis absorption spectra showed that the mixed perovskite thin films exhibited very similar absorption profiles but a slightly enhanced light absorption compared with the control sample (Fig. S1†).

Fig. 2c shows the steady-state photocurrents and output efficiency of the mixed ABX-3 perovskite solar cell at the maximum power points. For the champion device, a stabilized PCE of 15.5% was obtained with a stabilized current density output of 22.2 mA cm−2 at 0.70 V bias. In addition, the stabilized current densities of the mixed perovskite solar cells at the beginning of testing were lower than the output of devices after 1 min of light soaking. Fig. 2d shows that the IPCE spectra were measured under no bias light. The JSC values integrated from the IPCE spectra of ABX-3 and ABX-1 based devices are about 20.64 and 20.3 mA cm−2, respectively, which are slightly lower (about 2 mA cm−2) than the ones measured from the stabilized current density output. In addition, the ABX-3 based devices showed great reproducibility of the device performance and PCEs are mainly in the range of 14.5–15%, as shown in Fig. S2.†
In order to study the reason for the enhanced device performance and the recombination mechanism in the mesoscopic perovskite solar cells, the devices were analyzed by intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) measurement. The IMVS leads to the determination of the time constant for the frequency-dependent photovoltage response which is attributed to a certain recombination process occurring in the device.24–26 Here, the IMVS measurement was used to characterize the total recombination loss in MPSCs. The time constant τIMVS (Fig. 3a) can be obtained from the inverse of the minimum angular frequency (ωmin = 2πf) in an IMVS plot: τIMVS = 1/ωmin. Fig. 3a shows the time constant τIMVS determined by the IMVS measurements, as a function of VOC induced at different illumination intensities. The τIMVS provides information about the charge recombination lifetime without the need of fitting to a complex equivalent circuit.27 We find that the recombination lifetimes of the three different perovskite solar cells are mostly in the order of 10−5 s. The τIMVS of the ABX-3 based solar cell is longer than those of the cells based on the ABX-1. As indicated by the above results, the addition of BF4− has effectively alleviated the carrier recombination rate within the mixed perovskite devices. As a result, the mixed ABX-2 and ABX-3 perovskite solar cells both showed a higher VOC than ABX-1.

The above investigation showed that the mixed ABX-3 perovskite reduced defect density and charge recombination lifetime, which resulted in a dramatic improvement in device performance. This is because the 5-AVA helps to improve the crystallinity and pore-filling of the perovskite within the device, which contributed to achieving high-performance and stable devices.
To investigate the structural characteristics of the mixed perovskites, we performed structural characterization by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, as shown in Fig. 3b. The results show that the XRD spectra of the three mixed perovskite samples exhibited identical characteristic diffraction. The XRD spectra of the mixed perovskite films exhibited strong diffraction peaks of (110), (220) and (310) and minor peaks of (112) and (202). For the mixed ABX-3 perovskite film, the intensities of the (110) peak and (220) peak were enhanced compared with the ABX-1 perovskite, indicating a stronger preferred orientation on these facets. In addition, the 2θ value of the (110) diffraction peak for ABX-1, ABX-2 and ABX-3 is 14.09°,14.05° and 14.03°, respectively. There is a small shift of the (110) diffraction peak after BF4− doping. The experimental results suggest that high crystallinity and preferred orientation will influence charge dissociation and transport.4,28 Furthermore, we also carried out XRD measurements on the full device (above the carbon layer) infiltrated with the mixed perovskite crystals, as shown in Fig. S3.† Although the three samples exhibited identical characteristic diffraction, the intensity of the (110) peak increased for the mixed ABX-3 perovskite device, indicating again a stronger preferred orientation of the (110) facet induced by the introduction of MABF4.

Fig. 4 shows the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the perovskite films processed with the mixed ABX-1, ABX-2 or ABX-3 perovskite. The perovskite films were produced by the drop-casting process on the FTO/TiO2 or glass/ZrO2 substrate. Fig. 4a and b show the steady-state PL spectra of the samples based on the glass/ZrO2 and FTO/TiO2 substrate, respectively. The excitation wavelength was 532 nm. The different mesoscopic layers were used to study the charge carrier behaviour close to the interfaces between mixed perovskite films and charge collection layers. The mesoscopic TiO2 serves as the electron collection layer, while the mesoscopic ZrO2 only functions as an insulating scaffold in MPSCs. Fig. 4a shows the steady-state PL spectra of the samples based on glass/ZrO2. All the thin films displayed a PL emission peak at ∼760 nm, and the intensity of the film based on the mixed ABX-3 perovskite is higher than the control sample. This outcome indicates that the introduction of MABF4 into ABX-1 decreases the number of defects within the perovskite films. Under identical experimental conditions, the PL quantum yields of mixed perovskite films are greatly reduced when the perovskites are interfaced with an electron collecting TiO2, as shown in Fig. 4b. The mixed ABX-3 perovskite thin film has a higher degree of PL quenching than the other two mixed perovskite layers. The PL quenching is attributed to originate from efficient electron extraction across the interface.29–33 This indicates that the charge carrier extraction at the perovskite/TiO2 interface was enhanced by the introduction of MABF4.

Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated a simple one-step solution processing strategy to fabricate a new mixed cation/mixed halide (5-AVA)0.034MA0.966PbI2.95(BF4)0.05 perovskite that enhanced the performance of the MPSCs to 15.5% with a remarkably high VOC of 0.97 V. Compared with the mixed (5-AVA)0.034MA0.966PbI3 perovskite based device, the new mixed (5-AVA)0.034MA0.966PbI2.95(BF4)0.05 perovskite could improve the VOC of the solar cells. We demonstrated that the incorporation of MABF4 into the (5-AVA)0.034MA0.966PbI3 perovskite helps to produce high-quality perovskite crystals, which could decrease the charge recombination rates and the number of defects within the perovskite films.
