1. Introduction
There is considerable current interest in metal chalcogenides (sulfides, selenides or tellurides) stemming from their useful properties as thin films or in highly dispersed form.1 Potential applications of these materials are in devices such as solar cells (II–VI and III–VI), infrared detectors (IV–VI) and in room-temperature thermoelectric generators (V–VI). Simple, inexpensive and environmentally benign protocols are needed that also provide control over issues such as composition, size and morphology; facilitating the use of these materials in light emitting diodes, non-linear optics, lasers or solar cells.2
Lead is classified as a borderline soft metal in the hard/soft acid–base concept of Pearson3 and shows a wide variety of coordination numbers. Lead(IV) compounds are known to have coordination numbers between 4 and 8, but the majority of them have the coordination number four. Lead(II) can bind as few as two and as many as 10 ligands, with preferred coordination numbers of 4 or 6.4 Lead(II) forms stable complexes with both soft and hard donor atom ligands. In similar coordination environments, the affinity of lead(II) towards sulfur-based ligands tends to be higher than for harder oxygen- or nitrogen-donor groups. Despite considerable study of the coordination chemistry of lead(II) with S- or Se-donor atom ligands5 the rational design of complexes remains a challenge. Tuning of the structure of the ligands to satisfy the coordination preferences and requirements of the lead(II) atom is still not that well understood;6 the same is true in design of precursors for chalcogenides. Lead(II) complexes with sulfur, selenium or tellurium donor atom ligands have been studied widely during the last few decades.5 The reason for the sustained interest in these compounds lies in their significant structural diversity and potential for applications.6
Lead chalcogenides in various forms with critical dimensions on the order of nanometers have attracted considerable interest because of their unique physical and chemical properties and potential in many applications.7 The sulfides, selenides and tellurides are narrow band gap semiconductors. Their crystal structures are face-centered cubic, with coordination number six, and the rock-salt (halite) structure. The bonding between Pb and S, Se or Te is considered to be mostly ionic8 with the ionic property increasing down the group. The minimum energy gap Eg between the conduction band and the valence band is direct. Some of the properties are listed in Table 1. The band gaps can be tailored by making solid solutions, such as PbSe1−xTex or PbS1−xSe1−x.8 This has recently been achieved for materials in nano dispersed form for a wide range of compositions in the PbS1−xSe1−x system.9,10

Lead sulfide nanoparticles may be useful in electroluminescent devices such as light-emitting diodes. In addition, the exceptional third-order non-linear optical properties of PbS nanoparticles lead to the potential for application in high-speed switching.14 This material is also potentially useful for making devices that require small band-gap semiconductors with optical absorption and emission in the red and near-infrared region of the spectrum. Lead selenide is a promising material in many other applications including lasers,15 thermoelectric devices,16,17 near-infrared (near-IR) luminescence emitters18 and IR detectors.19 The selenides and tellurides are potentially superior materials for thermoelectric cooling and electric power generation.20 Stable solution-processed photovoltaic devices from colloidal lead selenide quantum dots having 3.6% power conversion efficiency in the infrared have been reported.21,22 The devices reach external quantum efficiencies of 46% in the infrared and 70% across the visible region. Ultra efficient multiple exciton generation (MEG) for single photon absorption in colloidal lead selenide and lead sulfide quantum dots have been reported.23 Results indicate that the threshold photon energy for MEG in quantum dots is twice the lowest exciton absorption energy. The biexciton effect which shifts the transition energy for absorption of a second photon also influences the early time transient absorption data and may contribute to a modulation observed when probing near the lowest interband transition.23
The pursuit of synthetic routes to lead chalcogenide quantum dots is not a recent endeavour. Bulk PbE (E = S, Se, or Te) have been prepared through the solid-state reaction of elements at elevated temperatures (950–1150 °C).24,25 Organometallic precursors have also been used to obtain bulk powders and thin films of PbE at significantly lower temperatures (200–300 °C).26,27 Rees et al.,28–30 have synthesized the lead thiolates Pb(SR)2 (R = tBu, iBu and sBu), which can be converted into lead sulfide by thermolysis. Low-temperature approaches include the precipitation of metal chalcogenides from aqueous solutions of the metal cation,31 the arrested precipitation from micelles,32 and the trapping of metal chalcogenides within a polymer matrix.33 Gases H2E (E = S, Se, or Te) are often used as the chalcogen source and these are notably noxious. Non aqueous solvents with elemental S, Se, or Te as the chalcogen source were used to synthesize metal chalcogenides.34 It has been reported that the reaction of sulfur, selenium, or tellurium with elemental lead in n-butylamine at room temperature produces crystalline PbE (E = S, Se, or Te).34
Single source approaches involve the use of an organometallic or metal–organic molecule as a source for the elements required in the growth of the target compound at the desired stoichiometry.35 Single-molecule precursor approach provides several key advantages over other routes.36,37 For example, the existence of preformed bonds may lead to material with lower defect concentrations. In the case of thin film deposition by chemical vapour deposition (CVD), conditions of flow and temperature become simpler. It is also possible to carry out deposition with relatively simple installations.38 Most of single source precursors are air-stable, non-toxic and easy to handle, often employ clean, low-temperature decomposition routes and yield crystalline nanomaterials with minimal impurity incorporation.39 In CVD, the presence of only one precursor molecule in the supply stream reduces the likelihood of pre-reaction and the associated contamination of the deposited film and permits intrinsic control of film stoichiometry. Ligand design allows a degree of control over both the type and the level of impurities incorporated into the films such as carbon from an alkyl group.
A number of lead complexes with S- and Se-donor atoms have been proposed as single source precursors for bulk or nanostructured PbS or PbSe.40–42 The precursors for these materials are designed to contain the required elements in a correct ratio. Under favorable conditions, the use of a molecular precursor also allows nanocrystal growth under mild conditions with good control over size-dispersity and crystallinity.
This review highlights some relevant examples of the use of lead chalcogenide single source precursors from different classes of S-, Se- and Te-containing compounds including: metal carbamates,43 xanthates,44 phosphates, phosphinates,45–47 and ureates.48
2. Structure of Pb(II) complexes
Divalent lead, with its electronic configuration [Xe]4f45d106s2, is one of the post-transition metal elements held to exhibit the ‘inert-pair effect’.49,50 This term refers to the resistance of the pair of outer electrons on Pb(II) to removal or to participation in covalent bond formation or hydrogen bonding.4 The structures of Pb(II) complexes with S- and Se-containing ligands have been explained using this idea as the basis of a valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) model with the lone pair as a component; ‘the stereochemically active inert lone pair effect’.49 The lone pair of electrons can be held to cause a non-spherical charge distribution around the Pb(II) cation, that is, the disposition of ligands around the cation results in an identifiable void.49 This gap in the coordination sphere has been considered evidence of a stereochemically active lone pair of electrons.51 The 6s electrons have larger binding energies than the corresponding 5s ones and 6s–6p hybridization is energetically less favourable causing the formation of a 6s2 inert pair.52–57 This chemically inert pair of electrons has been considered to be sterically active, resulting in distorted crystal structures.58
However, it has been demonstrated using partial electron densities of states (PEDOS) that the asymmetric electron density formed by Pb(II) is as a result of the interaction of the antibonding combination of Pb 6s and anion p states with unfilled Pb 6p.57 This analysis shows that coupling of Pb 6p with the antibonding Pb 6s–anion p states gives rise to the net asymmetry in the electron density on Pb. As the Pb 6s and 6p states are too distant in energy to couple directly, this coupling can only take place when there is an appropriate anion that can interact with Pb 6s generating Pb 6s states close to the Fermi level. The sulfur anion does not have the required energy to achieve this and therefore, the directed asymmetric density produced by PbS is weak and cannot stabilize the distorted structure relative to a symmetric structure of higher coordination. This explains why the rock-salt structure is the thermodynamically stable phase of PbS.57
3. Single source precursors
Several classes of single source precursors have been used for the preparation or deposition of lead chalcogenides. The structures of some more commonly used ligands for the preparation of such lead complexes are shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Some common ligands used to prepare lead complexes: (a) dichalcogenocarbamate, (b) dichalcogenophosphinate, (c) dichalcogenophosphate, (d) dichalcogenoimidodiphosphinate, (e) selenourea, (f) xanthate. 
3.1 Lead dichalcogenocarbamato complexes
The first report of the use of lead(II) dithiocarbamato complexes Pb(S2CNRR′)2 (R, R′ = Et, Bu, iBu) as single source precursors was by Trindade et al., in 1997.58 These compounds were used as single molecule precursors to produce nanocrystalline PbS by their thermolysis in trioctylphosphine oxide. It was discovered that the optical and morphological properties of the PbS nanocrystallites are strongly dependent on the temperature of synthesis and less so on the chemical nature of the precursor.58 PbS nanocrystals prepared by decomposition of Pb(S2CNiBu2)2 exhibited different morphologies depending on the temperature used for the preparation.58 The nanocrystals synthesized at 100 °C were spherical with average diameters of 6.3 nm. At 150 °C, a mixture consisting of a large fraction of cubic crystallites with average size of about 60 nm and a small fraction of spherical nanocrystals was obtained. In a related work by Lee et al.,59 large cubes were obtained by the decomposition of Pb(S2CNEt2)2 at 230 °C in hot phenyl ether and dodecylamine. In work developing this theme, an interesting observation was made and well defined, but structurally unprecedented, star-shaped PbS nanocrystals were synthesized when the precursor Pb(S2CNEt2)2, was injected into a hot phenyl ether solvent at 230 °C containing the capping molecule, dodecanethiol.59
The preparation of PbSe nanocrystals using diethyldiselenocarbamatolead(II) complex as a molecular precursor has been reported.60 The crystal structure is shown in Fig. 2. Similarly, using Pb(Se2CNMenHex)2, PbSe nanocrystals with cubic shape have been obtained.60
 Fig. 2  Crystal structure of Pb(Se2CNEt2)2.60 
Subsequently, several lead dithiocarbamato Pb(S2CNRR′)2 (R, R′ = Et, Bu, iBu) were tested by sublimation experiments to check their suitability for LP-MOCVD growth. On this basis, Pb(S2CNnBu2)2 was selected as the most promising precursor for the deposition of PbS.58 In related work, PbSe films were deposited from diethyldiselenocarbamatolead(II) by Chemical Vapour Deposition.61
3.2 Lead dichalcogenophosphinato complexes
The coordination chemistry of dithiophosphinato compounds has been well described and reviewed by others.46,62 Until recently the examples of fully characterized selenophosphinates were rare. The reported synthetic methods for the preparation of selenophosphinato ligands gave unstable and relatively air sensitive products and their preparations involved difficult reaction conditions.63 However, the X-ray single crystal structure of [Na2(Se2PPh2)·2THF·5H2O] had been reported.64 Other notable examples of metal selenophosphinates include [Ph2PSe2Li·THF·TMEDA] and [K (Se2PPh2)(THF)2]2.65 A series of metal complexes of bis(di-alkylselenophosphinyl)selenide [(R2PSe2)Se] with the general formula [M(R2PSe2)n] (M = Zn, Cd, Pb, In, Ga, Cu, Bi, Ni; R = iPr, Ph) and [MoV2O2Se2(Se2PiPr2)2] have subsequently been synthesized and used for the deposition of metal selenide thin films by the CVD method.66,67 Further investigations on diselenophosphinate ligands have led to new synthetic procedures. The method develops the idea that the (R2PSe2)− anion may be stabilized, and crystallized as an ionic compound if there is enough counter ion in reaction solution, an excess amount of HSiCl3/NEt3 was used. However, HSiCl3 reacts readily with NEt3 to form (HNEt3)(SiCl3) as a precipitate, making Se insertion difficult. The use of HSiEt3 instead of HSiCl3 overcame this problem and produced the ionic compound (HNEt3+)(R2PSe2−). The synthesis is presented in eqn (1) below. (1)R = iPr; tBu; Ph.
Bis(di-phenylthioselenophosphinato)lead(II) [Pb{(C6H5)2PSSe}2] has been synthesised at room temperature. This precursor has been used to make nanoparticles and deposit PbSe thin films.68 The compound is perfectly air stable and can be stored for long periods of time. Suitable crystals for single crystal X-ray analysis were obtained from a concentrated tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution at room temperature. The crystal structure is shown in Fig. 3.64,68
 Fig. 3  Crystal structure of Pb{(C6H5)2PSSe}2.68 
The geometry at the lead atom is a distorted square pyramidal with two sulphur and two selenium atoms, forming the base of the pyramid and the lone pair occupying the axial position.69 The decomposition behaviour of the compound was studied by thermographic analysis which indicated a single-step weight loss between 287–385 °C. The remaining residue was in slight excess of the theoretical value for bulk PbSe. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopic (EDS) analysis on the thin films produced did not detect any sulphur peaks however, phosphorus accumulated during the decomposition of the precursor. The precursor was also used to synthesize nanoparticles which resulted in a black precipitate and was confirmed by XRPD analysis as cubic PbSe without any impurities.68
Density functional calculations of the formation of PbSe from [Pb{(C6H5)2PSSe}2] concluded that the formation of PbSe in CVD may involve more than one mechanism but the steps that lead to the formation of PbSe are somewhat more favourable on thermodynamic grounds than those that lead to the formation of PbS.68
3.3 Lead dichalcogenophosphato complexes
Diselenophosphates have been shown to form monomeric, cluster, and polymeric complexes with a wide variety of metal ions due to their capability of adopting several binding modes through the two selenium atoms.49 The coordination chemistry of the ligands was investigated with the synthesis and study of the spectral properties of several (O,O′-diethyldiselenophosphato) metals.46,69,70 Pb2(Se2P(OMe)Ph)4 exists as a dimer and it has a central Pb2Se2 ring and each Pb has a distorted trigonal bipyramid geometry formed by chelating and bridging dsepo ligands. Each Pb atom is chelated by two dsepo ligands to presumably form a monomeric unit Pb(Se2P(OMe)Ph)2, and two units of this monomer dimerize via two Pb–Se bonds. The dimeric units are weakly held together in a network of Pb⋯Se and Se⋯Se interactions in the solid state (Fig. 4).
 Fig. 4  Crystal structure of Pb2(Se2P(OMe)Ph)4.46 
The polymeric complex, [Pb{Se2P(OiPr)2}2]n, has been successfully used to prepare PbSe materials as cubes and eight-armed rod dendrites, via a solvothermal process with the inclusion of the capping agents, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and ethylenediamine. A few polymeric complexes involving its lighter congener, dithiophosphates, are known.70 The molecular structure of the 1,10-phenanthroline adduct of Pb[S2P(OBui)2]2 is shown in Fig. 5. High-quality cube-shaped PbS nanocrystals prepared by a solvothermal decomposition of Pb[S2P(OCnH2n+1)2]2 in the presence of oleylamine at 140–180 °C has been reported.71
 Fig. 5  Crystal structure of Pb[S2P(OBui)2]2·phen.70 
3.4 Lead imidodichalcogenodiphosphinato complexes
Imidodiphosphinic acid derivatives R2P(E)NH(E)PR2′ (R, R′ = CH3, C6H5; E = O, S, NH) were first prepared by Schmidpeter et al.72 The synthetic process has since been adapted and improved by others to make a wide range of derivatives with R, R′ = iPr, tBu, Et, OEt, OPh and E = S, Se.73–75 A typical synthesis involves two steps: a simple condensation reaction of R2PCl with NH(SiMe3)2 to give phosphorus(III) compound, followed by oxidation with O, S or Se to give the desired product (eqn (2) and (3)). 2R2PCl + NH(SiMe3)2 → R2PNHPR2(2) (3)
The deprotonation of the amine H–N bond in R2P(E)NH(E)PR2 derivative leads to bidentate chelating ligand that can form neutral complexes of the type M(N(R2PE)2]n with transition or main group metals. An alternative route using (TMEDA) [Na[(SePiPr2)2N] has been used to prepare Pb[(SePiPr2)2N]2. The synthetic process is shown in eqn (4) below. The product was yellow in 53% yield and the crystal structure was determined and is as shown in Fig. 6.76 (4)
 Fig. 6  Crystal structure of [Pb[(SePiPr2)2N]2].76 
Kuno et al.77 used bis(imido(selenodiisopropylphosphinato)lead(II)) [Pb((SePiPr2)2N)2] and bis(diethyldithiocarbamato)lead(II) [Pb(S2CNEt2)2] as single source precursors for the growth of ternary PbSexS1−x (where x = 0.23, 0.39, 0.49, 0.68, 0.90) as well as binary PbSe and PbS nanowires (NWs). They observed that the estimated chalcogen content of the ternary NWs differs slightly from the expected amount which may be due to the different decomposition kinetics of Pb((SePiPr2)2N)2versus Pb(S2CNEt2)2. Also even in compositionally analogous single-source precursors, bond strengths can differ, leading to different decomposition kinetics. Based on these observations they suggest that Pb((SePiPr2)2N)2 decomposes more readily than Pb(S2CNEt2)2 because of its higher sensitivity towards temperature.77
The tellurium analogue of R2P(E)NH(E)PR2 cannot be prepared by oxidizing R2PNHPR2 with tellurium, following the scheme outlined in eqn (1)–(4). Chivers has developed a new scheme, in which R2PNHPR2 is first metalated by NaH to form Na[R2PNPR2] followed by a reaction with tellurium powder in hot toluene in the presence of N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine.78–80 The as-produced ligand, Na[N(TePiPr2)2], when reacting with appropriate metal halide produce complexes M[N(TePiPr2)]n with a range of metals.
Dichalcogenoimidodiphosphinato complexes of lead [Pb[(EPiPr2)2N]2] (E = S, Se, Te) have proved to be useful single source precursors for lead chalcogenide thin films.40,76 All the complexes are air-stable except [Pb[(TePiPr2)2N]2] which is prone to oxidation by air. These precursors have been used to deposit PbS or PbSe thin films by LP-MOCVD40 and PbTe thin films by AACVD.78
3.5 Lead selenoureato complexes

N,N-Dialkyl-N′-arylselenoureas are another class of compounds potentially useful as chalcogenide precursors. They were first prepared and reported by Douglass and Dains in 193748 (Scheme 1). N,N-Dialkyl-N′-arylselenoureas acts as a bidentate ligand and during complexation the loss of selenoamidic proton promotes the co-ordination of O and Se donor atoms with metal ions. The (4-nitro-N,N-di-iso-butyl-N-benzoylselenoureato)Pb (II) and N,N-diethyl-N-benzoylselenoureato)Pb (II) complexes81 have been used as single source precursors for the deposition of PbSe thin films.81 Bis(N,N-di-iso-butyl-N′-4-nitrobenzoylselenoureato)lead(II) was prepared according to the Scheme 1 by modifying the method previously reported in literature.53,54
 Scheme 1  Synthetic scheme for bis(N,N-di-iso-butyl-N′-4-nitrobenzoylselenoureato)lead(II).81 
The complex was used for the deposition of phosphorus free PbSe thin films by AACVD and nanoparticles by solution thermolysis. The TEM images are shown in Fig. 7 and the crystal structure of the seleno–lead complex is shown in Fig. 8.

3.6 Lead xanthato complexes
Xanthates (–S2COR) are a class of inorganic compounds which have been successfully used for the synthesis of metal sulfides82,83 with deposition temperatures for thin films as low as 250 °C. The successful growth of PbS thin films on polyimide (Kapton) substrates by AACVD from [Pb(S2COBu)2]84 at temperatures as low as 150 °C has been reported. Molloy et al.,85 have also synthesized lead xanthates including the Pb(S2COEt)2 bipyridal adduct (Fig. 9) and have deposited PbS from these precursors on pyrex glass, molybdenum-coated glass and silicon wafer by AACVD at 200 °C. The pyridine adducts of nickel xanthates deposited nickel sulfide films at 300 °C or above.82
 Fig. 9  Crystal structure of Pb(S2COEt)2·bipy.85 
The decomposition of xanthates is suggested to take place via the Chugaev elimination reaction in which alkene (R–H), OCS and MSH fragments are formed.83
In the first step of the classically written organic formation, a potassium xanthate is produced when the alkoxide reacts with carbon disulfide in the presence of methyl iodide (Scheme 2).
 Scheme 2  Reaction mechanism for the preparation of O-alkylxanthato complexes. 
The Chugaev elimination typically can occur at 200 °C, an alkene is formed by a syn-elimination, via a 6-membered cyclic transition state, the hydrogen atom is moved from the β-C-atom to the sulfur. The side product decomposes to carbonyl sulfide (OCS) and methanethiol (Scheme 3).
 Scheme 3  Chugaev elimination reaction. 
This clean elimination which also happens in metal xanthato complexes84–91 may be important in CVD and other materials processing environments by leading to low temperature decomposition.89,90
In solution based preparation of nanoparticles, amines are reported to substantially lower the decomposition temperatures of both xanthate and thiocarbamate precursors.86 Sun et al.,91 exhibited this when they successfully synthesized PbS cubes by adding lead xanthate into ethylene diamine solution at room temperature. It has also been found that complexation of the metal xanthate with various donor ligands can mitigate both the decomposition profile and solubility of the species and hence offer additional control over the conditions for metal sulphide formation.92
There is no report on the synthesis of lead selenoxanthate complexes however, selenoxanthate complexes of Ni (II), Pd(II), Cd(II), Cr(II) and Co(III) have been synthesized using the diselenoxanthogenate (C2H5OCSe2−) ligand.92 All these compounds are crystalline, monomeric in solution and non-electrolytes. These complexes are potentially interesting as single source precursors for the synthesis of nanoparticles or the deposition of thin films.
3.7 Other single source precursors
The monomeric homoleptic chalcogenolates lead(II) bis(2,4,6-trifluoromethylphenyl-selenolate) Pb[SeC6H2(CF3)3]2 and lead(II) bis[tris(trimethylsilyl)silyltellurolate] Pb[TeSi(SiMe3)3]2 were used as single-source precursors for the thermolytic formation of the lead chalcogenides (PbTe and PbSe) by a spin coating procedure using a polymer–precursor mixture.93 As the decomposition temperature of the lead chalcogenide precursor is below the degradation temperature of the polymer, nanoparticles of the semiconductor with diameter of 30–50 nm are formed in the polymer layer.
Lead thiobenzoate was used as single source precursor for the preparation of PbS nanoparticles by thermolysis in oleylamine/dioctyleamine/or trioctylamine as well as in ethylene diamine and dodecanthiol. The shape and size of the nanoparticles was strongly influenced by the type of amine or thiol used as capping agent and or solvent.94
A series of precursors were synthesized by Whitmire et al.95 by the reaction of lead acetate, with picolinic (Hpic), 2,6-dipicolinic (H2dipic) or salicylic (H2sal) acid followed by the addition of thiourea (tu) or thiosemicarbazide (ths). The compounds [Pb(Hsal)2(tu)2], [Pb(Hsal)2(ths)3·2H2O], [Pb(pic)2(tu)], [Pb(pic)2(ths)2]2, [Pb(dipic)(tu)(H2O)]2·2H2O, and [Pb(dipic)(ths)2]3·2H2O were used as single source precursors by thermolysing in both aqueous and non-aqueous media leading to give pure crystalline galena in all cases. Depending upon conditions such as temperature, time, concentration and type of surfactants truncated octahedra, dendrites, nanocubes, interlinked nanocubes, nanohexapods and cubes were obtained. The growth of particles (faceting/dissolution) in aqueous media was monitored with time. The reaction was quenched at intervals of 1, 2, 5, 8, and 16 h. The reactions were carried out in stainless-steel lined Teflon vessel maintained at 170 °C in the hydrothermal oven. Fig. 10 shows the SEM images for (A) 2 h, (B, C) 5 h and (D) 16 h.95

Salavati-Niasari et al.96 used [bis(thiosemicarbazide)lead(II)], [Pb(TSC)2]Cl2 (TSC = H2NNHCSNH2 (thiosemicarbazide)) as single source precursor by solvothermal method to grow PbS with different shapes and morphology. The precursor was synthesised by the simple reaction of a solution of lead(II) chloride in water with thiosemicarbazide in water in 1:2 molar ratios and dropwise addition of 37% hydrochloric acid while stirring at room temperature. The mixture was then refluxed for about 6 h to give a white crystalline solid as product. Different shapes of PbS nanostructures were prepared by hydrothermal process at 150 °C, using oleylamine or triphenylphosphine acting both as medium and the stabilizing reagents. Also the precursor was pyrolysed in the solid state at 400, and 500 °C for 5 h. The effects of reaction time on hydrothermal method on the morphology and shape of PbS powders are similar to those described by Whitmire et al.95
4. Conclusions
This review summarizes some routes to the syntheses of lead chalcogenides using single molecule precursors. The precursors considered are dichalcogenocarbamates, dichalcogenophosphinates, dichalcogenophosphates, imidodichalcogenophosphinates, selenoureates and xanthates. Several groups have successfully used such chalcogenide-based lead complexes. The resulting compounds do overcome some of the problems associated with the use of single source routes either for thin films or nanocrystal formation. Xanthates (–S2COR) have been notable in being successfully used for material synthesis at low temperatures. Table 2 gives a summary of lead precursors used for the deposition of lead chalcogenide thin films.

Given the potential importance of these chalcogenides, in applications as diverse as hybrid solar cells and sensors, we envisage that chemists will continue their interests with important objectives led by: our need for sustainable process and energy sources, a need to minimize environmental impact and a need for cost effective processes for materials based on common (cheaper) elements. These objectives will be mirrored by technological needs such as low-temperature processing (deposition on plastics), higher and more reproducible optical and electronic properties. The area remains one that is ripe for further development and discovery.
