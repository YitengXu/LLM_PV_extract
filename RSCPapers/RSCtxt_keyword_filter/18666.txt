    , Accepted 17th August 2017First published on 15th September 2017AbstractTernary earth-abundant Cu2SnS3 (CTS) absorbers were synthesized from a Cu/SnS2 stacked precursor by direct annealing in a S atmosphere and by pre-annealing at lower temperature followed by sulfurization. The existing S within the chosen Cu/SnS2 precursor allows avoiding the interface voids commonly generated from a metal precursor. We found that direct annealing of the S-containing precursor at 570 °C in a S atmosphere also generated voids mostly in the middle of the film because a CuS layer is formed on the precursor surface resulting in the discharge of excess S from the SnS2 layer. To eliminate the voids in the CTS film, we developed a two-step annealing process that consists of pre-annealing at 400 °C in N2 and sulfurization at 570 °C in a S atmosphere. The developed process yields a void-free CTS film with a smooth surface and tightly-connected grains. The phase evolution in the CTS films was analyzed by X-ray and Raman spectroscopy, and reaction pathways to form a dense Cu2SnS3 film from the Cu/SnS2 precursor are revealed. Our study demonstrated that appropriate design of annealing could grow a large-grain and dense CTS absorber required for a cost-effective thin film solar cell. Photoluminescence analysis confirmed that the CTS film grown by the two-step annealing process exhibited fewer deep-level defects compared to the film grown by direct annealing in a S atmosphere. The conversion efficiency of the solar cell based on the developed absorber is higher than that of a device using a CTS absorber synthesized by direct sulfurization. However, low values of the open-circuit voltage and fill factor indicate that fine control of the CTS composition is necessary to improve the device performance.
Introduction
The efficiency of solar cell power conversion of chalcopyrite-based Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) thin films has reached above 22%.1 However, indium and gallium are too rare and expensive to be used in large scale mass production of this technology. Recently, a kesterite-based Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) material has attracted the most attention because its constituent elements Zn and Sn are earth abundant. Efficiencies up to 12.7% have been achieved for CZTSSe thin-film solar cells.2 However, CZTSSe is a complex material with five elements; it is difficult to suppress the formation of secondary phases, including binary ZnS and ternary Cu2SnS3. Within the CZTSSe system, Cu2SnS3 is a ternary compound with less complex chemistry and also its constituents are earth abundant, which makes this material an attractive candidate as an absorber for the fabrication of thin film solar cells owing to its appropriate optoelectronic properties such as p-type conductivity with a high optical absorption coefficient of over 104 cm−1 and wide band gaps in the range of 0.9–1.35 eV for different tetragonal, monoclinic and cubic crystal structures.3,4
However, in the Cu–Sn–S system, several compounds have been reported with various combinations of Cu2S and SnS2 including Cu4Sn7S16, Cu2Sn3S7, Cu2SnS3, and Cu4SnS4 phases5 and various combinations of CuS and SnS including a Cu3SnS4 phase. All of these materials have potential as absorbers in thin film solar cells (TFSCs). Among these, the Cu2SnS3 (CTS) compound has been widely investigated as an absorber for TFSCs.5–7 At present, CTS thin film solar cells have been reported to have a conversion efficiency of 4.80%.8 The achieved efficiency is much lower than the Shockley Queisser limit for a band gap of 1.0 eV.4 The presence of secondary phases in the absorber limits the performance of solar cells. Therefore, it is necessary to precisely control the composition and S pressure during the film synthesis to minimize unwanted secondary phases.
The growth of CTS films by various chemical and physical methods has been reported: chemical bath deposition (CBD),9–11 nanoparticle synthesis,12–15 SILAR,16 solution process,17 solid state reaction,18,19 vacuum co-evaporation,20–26 sputtering,27–33 pulsed laser deposition,34 and electro-deposition.35 Among these methods, the sputtering process appears to be a favorable process because it provides very good film uniformity in thickness and composition on large areas to achieve low-cost solar cells. With this motivation, in this work, CTS films were grown using a two-step process, in which the first step is sputter deposition of a precursor followed by sulfurization of the precursor in a sulfur atmosphere. We chose a Cu metal and binary SnS2 compound as the precursor source instead of Cu and Sn metals, where Sn metal leads to lumps during the deposition due to its poor wettability.20 Direct sulfurization of a Cu/Sn metal precursor generates voids at the Mo/CTS interface due to the lack of S diffusion from the outside. The Cu/SnS2 precursor might suppress void formation because it contains S.
In this work, we report the morphological evolution in CTS films from a Cu/SnS2 stacked precursor by direct annealing in a S atmosphere and by pre-annealing at lower temperature followed by sulfurization. The phase changes in the CTS films were analyzed by X-ray and Raman spectroscopy and the reaction pathway between Cu and SnS2 was determined from a Cu–Sn–S ternary phase diagram. The results revealed that the film grown by direct annealing had voids and a bi-layer morphology, whereas the film grown by two-step annealing resulted in a void-free, dense Cu2SnS3 film. The low temperature photoluminescence spectra of the CTS films showed that recombination was due to donor-to-acceptor pair (DAP) transitions.
The efficiencies of the CTS solar cells fabricated with the CTS films using direct annealing and two-step annealing with no KCN surface treatment were 0.33 and 0.52%, respectively. The both low efficiencies may result from the existence of deep-level defects caused by secondary phases including Cu4SnS4 or SnS in the absorbers.
Experimental
Precursor deposition and annealing
A Cu/SnS2 stacked precursor was deposited by a sputtering method. The Cu metal and compound SnS2 layers were deposited by DC sputtering and RF sputtering, respectively, on a Mo-coated soda-lime glass (SLG) substrate. A Mo back contact layer with a thickness of 1 μm was deposited by DC sputtering using standard Mo bi-layer deposition conditions to achieve good adhesion and low resistivity layers. The powers used for Cu and SnS2 deposition were 80 and 50 W, respectively. The base pressure was 1 × 10−6 Torr, and the working pressure was fixed to 1 mTorr with an Ar flow rate of 100 sccm. All the deposition was carried out without substrate heating. The cross-sectional morphology of the stacked precursor with a sequence Cu/SnS2/Mo is shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  SEM cross-section of the Cu/SnS2/Mo precursor layer. 
The stacked precursor was loaded into a carbon crucible and annealed under two different conditions. In the first condition, the precursor was annealed in a S atmosphere at 570 °C for 10 min by introducing S powder in the carbon crucible, with a ramp rate of 57 °C min−1. In the second condition, the precursor was pre-annealed in a N2 atmosphere at 300–400 °C and then the pre-annealed sample was sulfurized at 570 °C for 10 min in a S atmosphere. In the present study, we refer to first and second annealing conditions as direct sulfurization and a two-step process, respectively. After sulfurization, the samples were allowed to cool to room temperature naturally. The process parameters for the synthesis of the CTS absorbers by direct sulfurization and two-step annealing are given in Fig. 2.

CTS solar cell fabrication
CTS thin-film solar cells were fabricated with a configuration of Mo/CTS/CdS/i-ZnO/AZO/Al. A 50 nm thick CdS buffer layer was deposited by a CBD process from a solution (400 ml) consisting of 0.0015 M CdSO4, 0.05 M (NH2)2CS and 1.5 M NH4OH. The deposition time was 6.5 min after the bath temperature reached 45 °C. After the buffer layer deposition, 50 nm thick i-ZnO and 300 nm thick AZO window layers were deposited by RF sputtering. Then an Al top contact was deposited by thermal evaporation. Finally, the devices with an active area of 0.43 cm2 were defined by mechanical isolation scribing.
Characterization
The phases present in the pre-annealed precursors and sulfurized CTS films were analyzed using a Rigaku ‘Ultima IV’ X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (1.5416 Å) and by Raman spectroscopy using a laser excitation wavelength of 514 nm. The surface and cross-sectional morphologies of the films were observed using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). The composition of the sulfurized films was measured using an energy dispersive energy spectroscope (EDS) attached to the FESEM. The compositional depth profile of CTS films was measured after Ar ion etching using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo VG Scientific ‘K-alpha’ with a micro-focused monochromatic Al-Kα). To understand the reaction mechanism during pre-annealing at various temperatures, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was carried out with a precursor sample which was scratched from a Mo substrate. Low temperature photoluminescence (LTPL) measurements were performed on CTS films in the wavelength region of 300 to 1400 nm. The illuminated current–voltage characteristics of the solar cells were measured at room temperature with a solar simulator (McScience, Korea) under AM1.5 100 mW cm−2 illumination.
Results and discussion
Growth of CTS film by direct sulfurization

Fig. 3 shows the SEM surface image (a) and cross-sectional image (b) of the CTS film after direct sulfurization at 570 °C for 10 min. The thickness estimated from a cross-sectional image of the film was around 1 μm. The surface morphology in Fig. 3a exhibits a microstructure with densely connected grains. The facets in the grains are well developed. The cross-sectional image (Fig. 3b) shows a bi-layer morphology with larger grains at the top half of the layer and fine grains at the bottom half of the layer. Between the two layers, large voids were developed, apparently forming a void plane. The large grains at the surface can be explained by a liquid-assisted grain growth mechanism. The excess S during direct sulfurization can exhibit a CuS–S eutectic condition at the surface and the liquid from the eutectic can enhance the grain growth of CTS at the surface. Small voids are also observed on the bottom of the CTS film. The morphology of the film reveals that direct sulfurization of the Cu/SnS2 precursor leads to formation of an inhomogeneous film of grain size with many voids in the middle of the CTS film. This kind of morphology is not desirable for films applied to highly reproducible thin-film cells. CTS films must have a void-free and compact morphology.8,27

Fig. 4 shows the XRD pattern (a) and Raman spectrum (b) of the CTS film grown by direct sulfurization at 570 °C for 10 min. The XRD pattern in Fig. 4a shows the diffraction peaks of monoclinic CTS phase, which correspond to the ICDD04-010-5179 card for the monoclinic CTS phase. A SnS peak appears as a secondary phase. Since the composition of our sample was Cu-deficient with Cu/Sn = 1.7, the existence of a Sn-rich phase such as SnS was appropriate. The Raman spectrum in Fig. 4b also shows peak positions at 291 and 350 cm−1 corresponding to a Cu2SnS3 phase. The XRD and Raman analyses confirmed that the Cu2SnS3 phase can be obtained by annealing at 570 °C for 10 min with single step sulfurization.

Due to the deep penetration depth of X-ray, the XRD pattern delineates all phases in the film. On the other hand, due to strong absorption of laser waves by the CTS absorber, the Raman spectrum delineates phases of the CTS film. From XRD and Raman analyses, a SnS secondary phase was revealed at the lower part of the CTS film. The grain growth of CTS might be inhibited by the SnS secondary phase in the lower part of the CTS film.
By direct annealing, we found that the CTS film formed a bi-layer morphology and large voids existed between the two layers. A SnS secondary phase was found due to the Cu-deficient composition and the SnS phase existed in the lower part of the film. To employ the CTS film as a light absorber, a new process that suppresses voids in the CTS film must be developed. In our experiment, we introduced a pre-annealing step before the final sulfurization step. To remove voids in the CTS films, the as-deposited precursors were annealed at 200 °C, 300 °C, 400 °C and 500 °C for 10 min in N2. The next section reports the phase evolution by the pre-annealing step.
Phase evolution during pre-annealing in N2

Fig. 5 shows the cross-sectional and surface images of the Cu/SnS2 film right after pre-annealing at 200 °C, 300 °C, 400 °C and 500 °C in N2. As can be seen, the temperature in the range of 200° to 400 °C does not affect the film thickness that can be estimated to be around 1 μm. However, pre-annealing at 500 °C resulted in a not-uniform film with disconnected regions, and the thickness can be estimated to be around 5–7 μm. No morphology change was observed in the samples annealed at 200 °C and 300 °C. The surface morphology shows a woven fiber bunch, probably due to a break in the plate-like SnS2 morphology. At 400 °C, the woven bunch became worm-shaped grains. Bigger voids also appeared among the grains. At 500 °C, the film contained disconnected and agglomerated regions, suggesting that a large amount of liquid phase formed at that temperature. The results indicate that there is an optimum pre-annealing temperature, where the stacked precursor is intermixed but not melted.

Fig. 6 shows the XRD patterns (a) and Raman spectra (b) of the Cu/SnS2 film right after pre-annealing at 200 °C, 300 °C, 400 °C and 500 °C in N2. The XRD pattern of the Cu/SnS2/Mo precursor layer reveals that SnS2 is in an amorphous state. At 200 °C annealing, peaks corresponding to a binary SnS phase are dominant in the film. At 300 °C annealing, peaks related to ternary Cu4SnS4 phases appeared. At 400 °C, the intensity of SnS and Cu4SnS4 increased. At 500 °C, a MoS2 phase appeared in the pattern. The Raman spectra in Fig. 6b reveal weak SnS peaks at 200 °C, suggesting that SnS starts to form in the bottom bulk or bottom first because the XRD pattern clearly showed a SnS peak at 200 °C. At 300 °C, strong SnS and Cu4SnS4 peaks appeared. At 400 °C, only the Cu4SnS4 peak appears while the SnS peak does not appear even though the SnS phase exists from X-ray diffraction. This indicates that the surface of the CTS film is covered mostly with Cu4SnS4 and the SnS phase in the bulk is not detected in the Raman spectra. At 500 °C, MoS2 peaks appeared due to the exposure of the Mo surface to S by melt agglomeration. The XRD and Raman analyses showed that a SnS phase formed on the bottom layer and a Cu4SnS4 phase formed on the top layer by N2 annealing. Also note that no Cu2SnS3 phase was formed by N2 annealing.

To understand the reaction mechanism during pre-annealing at various temperatures, DSC was carried out with a precursor sample. Fig. 7 shows the DSC curve of the Cu/SnS2 stacked precursor annealed up to 500 °C. The initial phase of SnS2 is in an amorphous state in the XRD pattern. It shows a phase transition at 177 °C, possibly to crystalline SnS2 on the nanoscale because there was no XRD pattern of SnS2. Above 200 °C, the reaction takes place continuously. This suggests that a solid-state reaction takes place continuously. Our XRD pattern and Raman spectra show that a SnS phase formed between 200 °C and 300 °C and a Cu4SnS4 phase formed between 300 °C and 400 °C. The turnover of the heat flow around 420 °C indicates that the solid-state reaction is completed at 420 °C. The film starts to melt at 440 °C, suggesting that this pre-annealing temperature should not be above 440 °C to avoid agglomeration. The DSC curve indicates that the optimum temperature for pre-annealing is in the range of 300 °C to 400 °C.
 Fig. 7  DSC analysis of the Cu/SnS2 precursor. 
Based on the information obtained from XRD, Raman, and DSC analyses, the reaction in the Mo/a-SnS2/Cu precursor in N2 can be summarized as follows. 200 °C: a-SnS2−x → SnS + S(1) 300 °C and 400 °C: 4Cu + 3SnS2 → Cu4SnS4 + 2SnS(2) 500 °C: Mo + 2SnS2 → MoS2 + 2SnS(3)

Reaction (3) that forms Cu2SnS3 is possible but it was barely detected in either XRD or Raman analysis. Under a reduced environment (N2 environment), reaction (2) that forms Cu4SnS4 and SnS phases was certainly dominant at low temperature.
Growth of the Cu2SnS3 film by a two-step annealing process
The X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and DSC analysis results suggested that the optimum pre-annealing temperature in N2 is in the range of 300 °C to 400 °C. To reduce the inhomogeneity in the film, the pre-annealing time was increased from 10 to 50 min.

Fig. 8 shows the XRD patterns (a) and Raman spectra (b) of the CTS films prepared by a two-step annealing process. The samples were annealed at either 360 or 400 °C for 50 min in N2 followed by sulfurization at 570 °C for 10 min. As shown in Fig. 8a, the film prepared by 360 °C pre-annealing shows strong SnS peaks in addition to Cu2SnS3 peaks. On the other hand, the film prepared by 400 °C pre-annealing shows a predominantly Cu2SnS3 monoclinic phase with a very weak SnS secondary phase. Also note that a peak corresponding to a MoS2 phase appeared at 2θ = 14°. The Raman spectra of the films clearly exhibit peak positions at 290 and 351 cm−1 corresponding to a monoclinic phase in CTS as shown in Fig. 8b. The results are in good agreement with those reported for CTS grown by sputtering and sulfurization.30–32 The above results indicate that 400 °C pre-annealing is appropriate to obtain a major monoclinic CTS phase, while 360 °C pre-annealing is not appropriate due to too much SnS secondary phase in the bottom part of the film. Therefore, pre-annealing at 400 °C is necessary to obtain a homogeneous monoclinic Cu2SnS3 phase with the minimum SnS secondary phase.
 Fig. 8  XRD patterns (a) and Raman spectra (b) of the CTS films prepared by a two-step annealing process. Samples were annealed at either 360 or 400 °C in N2 and then annealed at 570 °C in a S atmosphere. 
The difference between the direct sulfurization and two-step annealing process from the chemical reaction point of view is as follows. In the direct sulfurization, Cu + S → CuS(4) 2CuS + SnS2 → Cu2SnS3 + 1/2S2 (g)(5)
In the two-step annealing process, 4Cu + 3SnS2 → Cu4SnS4 + 2SnS(6) Cu4SnS4 + SnS → 1/2S2(g) → 2Cu2SnS3(7)
Gas discharge appears in the direct sulfurization, resulting in voids inside the film, and no gas discharge appears in the two-step annealing process, resulting in a void-free film.

Fig. 9 shows SEM surface images (a and c) and cross-sectional images (b and d) of CTS films prepared by a two-step annealing process. The samples were annealed at 400 °C for either 10 min (a and b) or 50 min (c and d) in N2 followed by sulfurization at 570 °C for 10 min. As can be seen in Fig. 9b and d, the pre-annealing time did not influence the film thickness. The thickness of CTS is uniform throughout the film and can be estimated to be around 1 μm. The surface morphology of the film grown by pre-annealing at 400 °C for 10 min shows closely connected grains with well-developed facets as seen in Fig. 9a. The cross-sectional morphology of this film exhibits large grains with no voids at the interface as seen in Fig. 9b. The grain size is as large as the film thickness and fairly uniform.

The surface morphology of the film grown by pre-annealing at 400 °C for 50 min shows two grains with two different sizes: about 1 μm and about 10 nm, in which large and small grains exist together in close contact as seen in Fig. 9c. The cross-sectional morphology of the film shows voids at the lower part and bottom of the film as seen in Fig. 9d. The results suggest that too long annealing time at 400 °C in N2 releases SnS2 or S from SnS2, resulting in void formation. It is well known that SnS2 is a highly volatile compound.20
It is clear that the optimum conditions to obtain a void-free CTS film with large grains from a Mo/SnS2/Cu stacked precursor are those for the two-step annealing process, in which the film is pre-annealed in N2 for 10 min at 400 °C and subsequently annealed at 570 °C for 10 min in a S atmosphere. The microstructure of the film revealed a compact and smooth microstructure with large grains and without voids. A MoS2 layer formed on the Mo surface with an estimated thickness of 60–100 nm.

Table 1 summarizes the atomic compositions in two different CTS films. CTS1 is the film prepared by direct sulfurization at 570 °C for 10 min in a S atmosphere and CTS2 is the film prepared by a two-step process, in which the film was pre-annealed at 400 °C in N2 for 10 min and subsequently annealed at 570 °C for 10 min. The Cu/Sn atomic ratios of the CTS1 and CTS2 films were 1.61 and 1.59, respectively, indicating that the ratio did not change meaningfully even though the growth process was different. The compositions of the CTS1 and CTS2 films were Cu1.61SnS2.67 and Cu1.59SnS2.78, respectively. In both cases, S was slightly deficient from a stoichiometric point of view, suggesting that the sample should be further annealed at lower temperature to fill the S deficiency.

Fig. 10 shows the XPS depth profiles of Cu, Sn, and S elements in the two different films. It is seen that both films have similar depth profiles of Cu, Sn, and S elements. The Cu concentration is low at the surface and increases toward the CTS bulk, while the Sn concentration is high at the surface and decreases toward the CTS bulk. Since the Cu metal layer was at the top of the SnS2 bottom layer in the precursor, the conversion of low Cu concentration and high Sn concentration at the surface in the CTS film is astonishing. This might be due to the fast diffusion of Cu into the CTS bulk, commonly observed in CZTSSe films.36 It is known that low Cu concentration at the surface is desirable to achieve high device performance in CIGS solar cells.37

Defects

Fig. 11 shows the PL spectra of two CTS films measured at 10 K to understand the point defects in the films. The spectra are fitted to five peaks at 0.78, 0.80, 0.83, 0.86, and 0.93–0.94 eV, respectively. The peak at the energy of 0.93 eV can be attributed to the band-to-band transition and other observed energy levels are ascribed to shallow (DAP) transitions.38 It is known that monoclinic CTS have a band gap energy of 0.92–1.0 eV.39 The intensity change in the PL spectra of both samples suggests that the CTS2 film grown by the two-step process has better quality than the film grown by direct sulfurization. The spectra of the CTS1 film showed much lower PL peaks indicating that the film is so defective that non-radiative recombination is dominant.
 Fig. 11  PL spectra of two CTS films measured at 10 K. CTS 1 was prepared by direct sulfurization and CTS2 was prepared by a two-step process. 
The energy differences of peaks 1, 2, 3, and 4 from peak 1 are 150–160, 130–140, 100–110, and 70–80 meV, respectively. The predominant acceptor in CTS is VCu with formation energies of 40 to 70 meV and the donor level in the CTS film is reported to be about 24 to 54 meV.5,39 Hence, the transitions observed in the CTS films were due to donor-to-acceptor pair transitions. However, a secondary Cu4SnS4 phase can also form during the growth of CTS, for which the calculated direct gap is 0.82 eV.5 The XRD and Raman spectra of the samples barely reveal the presence of this phase in the films. T. H. Sajeesh et al. reported an emission peak at 0.75–0.76 eV in a SnS film.40 Peak 1 at 0.78 eV might be related to the deep level in the SnS secondary phase.
Application to solar cells

Fig. 12 shows the J–V curves and IPCE spectra of CTS TFSCs from employing CTS1 and CTS2. The cell conversion efficiencies of CTS cells based on CTS1 and CTS2 films are 0.33 and 0.52%, respectively. The short-circuit current density, (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF) of the cell employing the CTS1 film are 11.50 mA cm−2, 89 mV, and 32.23%, respectively, while the Jsc, Voc, and FF of the cell based on the CTS2 film are 19.17 mA cm−2, 87 mV, and 30.99%, respectively. It is clear that the device with the CTS2 film, which had no voids in the bulk, performed better.

J–V curves (a) and IPCE spectra (b) of CTS thin-film solar cells by employing two different CTS films under illumination. CTS1 was prepared by direct sulfurization and CTS2 was prepared by a two-step process. 
The efficiencies obtained in this work were less than the reported efficiencies for CTS thin film solar cells.8,27,28,31 Note that the Voc was too low in both cells. The shunt resistance (Rsh) and series resistance (Rs) of the cell with the CTS1 film are 28.4 and 9.3 Ω cm2, respectively, while those values for the cell with CTS2 are 15.2 and 6.5 Ω cm2, respectively. The small values of Voc and Rsh indicate that the depletion of the CTS surface was either not well developed due to a poor CdS/CTS interface or not well defined due to a rough surface. The presence of a Cu-rich phase such as Cu4SnS4 on the film surface could increase shunting, resulting in lower Voc and smaller FF. KCN treatment of the CTS surface to remove a possible Cu-rich secondary phase might be necessary to improve the cell performance.4
The high value of Rs suggests that the defects in the CTS film and the thickness of the MoS2 layer on Mo were not well controlled. Recombination through deep levels in the CTS films reduced excess carrier concentration, resulting in lower Voc and Jsc and smaller FF. Careful control of film composition and appropriate post deposition annealing in sulfur could reduce the defects, resulting in better cell performance.
Conclusions
We grew an earth-abundant Cu2SnS3 thin film by sulfurization of a sputter-deposited Cu/SnS2 precursor layer. The CTS film grown by direct sulfurization at 570 °C showed a bi-layer morphology with many voids in the middle of the film and a few in the bottom of the film.
To suppress the formation of the void by sulfurization, we introduced pre-annealing at an intermediate temperature in N2. By annealing at 300 and 400 °C, the film contained SnS and Cu4SnS4 phases as seen in the XRD and Raman analyses. Annealing at 500 °C resulted in agglomeration and disconnected grains due to melting of the precursor. The differential scanning calorimetry measurement indicates that the optimum pre-annealing temperature is between 300 and 400 °C. A dense, void-free, highly-columnar, and faceted-grain morphology of the CTS film was successfully obtained by a two-step annealing process, in which the film was pre-annealed at 400 °C for 10 min in N2 and subsequently annealed at 570 °C in a S atmosphere.
The LTPL spectra showed that the quality of the CTS film prepared by the two-step annealing process was much better than that of the CTS film prepared by direct sulfurization. The conversion efficiency of the CTS cell that employed the CTS film prepared by the two-step process exhibited an initial efficiency of 0.52%. The Voc value was very low due to shunting in the devices and high series resistance. Shunting might be controlled by the removal of conductive components on the CTS surface. The defects need to be further reduced by fine tuning the composition and low-temperature annealing in sulfur. Our study demonstrated that by properly choosing the annealing conditions, it is possible to grow a large-grain, dense CTS film with few recombination defects.
