    , Accepted 18th July 2016First published on 18th July 2016AbstractPlasmon-mediated energy transfer is highly desirable in photo-electronic nanodevices, but the direct injection efficiency of “hot electrons” in plasmonic photo-detectors and plasmon-sensitized solar cells (plasmon-SSCs) is poor. On another front, Fano resonance induced by strong plasmon–exciton coupling provides an efficient channel of coherent energy transfer from metallic plasmons to molecular excitons, and organic dye molecules have a much better injection efficiency in exciton-SSCs than “hot electrons”. Here, we investigate enhanced light-harvesting of chlorophyll-a molecules strongly coupled to Au nanostructured films via Fano resonance. The enhanced local field and plasmon resonance energy transfer are experimentally revealed by monitoring the ultrafast dynamical processes of the plexcitons and the photocurrent flows of the assembled plexciton-SSCs. By tuning the Fano factor and anti-resonance wavelengths, we find that the local field is largely enhanced and the efficiency of plexciton-SSCs consisting of ultrathin TiO2 films is significantly improved. Most strikingly, the output power of the plexciton-SSCs is much larger than the sum of those of the individual plasmon- and exciton-SSCs. Our observations provide a practical approach to monitor energy and electron transfer in plasmon–exciton hybrids at a strong coupling regime and also offer a new strategy to design photovoltaic nanodevices.
Introduction
Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of metallic nanostructures largely enhances the local electromagnetic field and therefore is widely used to improve the efficiency of optical as well as optoelectronic processes, such as light absorption,1–8 scattering,9–13 photoluminescence,14–18 and photocurrent generation.19–28 Atwater et al. summarized three typical mechanisms of plasmonic solar cells based on enhancing light scattering, confinement, and trapping, respectively.1 Various metallic nanostructures (including nanoparticles, nanoplates, gratings, etc.) have been designed and fabricated to improve the performance of photovoltaic devices and the sensitivity of photodetectors.1,29–36 Knight et al. reported plasmon-enhanced photocurrent generation through plasmon-induced hot electron injection from gold nanorods to an Si substrate.37 Optically-excited surface plasmons have very large absorption cross sections and could also be employed as sensitizers to construct plasmon-sensitized solar cells (plasmon-SSCs), however they suffer from poor efficiency.24 Therefore, improving the injection efficiency of the “hot electrons” generated from plasmons in the cell is highly desirable. Several groups have made great efforts, such as enhanced plasmonic dye-SSCs using core–shell Au–SiO2, Ag@TiO2 and Au–TiO2 nanoparticles and P3HT-based nanoarchitectural Fano solar cells,38–41 providing novel ways of improving the light conversion efficiency up to 14%.40
Strong coupling between plasmons and excitons leads to the formation of plexcitons, which are usually identified by a Fano resonance or Rabi splitting in the absorption spectrum.42–53 Rabi splitting energy quantitatively describes the coupling strength and coherent exchange of the energy between plasmons and excitons.44,52,53 The depth of a Fano dip indicates the efficiency of the energy transfer from plasmons to molecular excitons in the plexciton hybrids.54 This energy transfer can be illustrated by using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations,54 and the nonlinear and quantum behaviors of this transfer process are theoretically revealed using quantum approaches.43,45 The dynamical processes of energy transfer and exchange in the strongly coupled plexciton hybrids have also been reported very recently.55 This energy transfer offers a promising new channel to enhance light-harvesting efficiency, but related studies have been seldom reported so far.18
In this paper, at first we demonstrate the tunability of the plexciton Fano resonances of Au nanostructured films (AuNFs) strongly coupled with chlorophyll-a (Chl) molecules and investigate the ultrafast dynamical processes of the Au@Chl hybrids. Furthermore, we comparatively study the SPR-dependent short-circuit currents and open-circuit voltages of the plasmon-SSCs (AuNF-SSCs) and plexciton-SSCs (Au@Chl-SSCs) consisting of ultrathin TiO2 films. Finally, we discuss energy transfer channels induced by plexciton Fano resonance for enhancing the light-harvesting efficiency of dye molecules and improving the performance of SSCs.
Experimental
Preparing nanostructured gold films and Chl coated films
The gold films composed of Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) were deposited by sputtering in an argon atmosphere with a sputtering pressure of 5 Pa and a power of 1.5 kV × 7 mA (Quorum-K575X). The AuNP size and the SPR of the films were adjusted by controlling the sputtering deposition time, which ranged from 10 s to 120 s. The morphology of the nanostructure films was analyzed by using atomic force microscopy (Smart SPM). The purified chlorophyll-a (purity > 85%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA), and was dissolved in ethanol. The prepared solutions, with different chlorophyll concentrations, were spin-coated onto the nanostructured films on a fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate.
Preparation of solar cells
For the preparation of solar cells, ultrathin TiO2 films were deposited onto FTO glass as anodes using magnetron sputtering (Quorum-K575X). The thickness of the deposited TiO2 films was monitored by a quartz crystal. The average thickness of the TiO2 films was about 5 nm. Pt film was the counter anode and I− ↔ I3− was used as the redox shuttle for the electrolyte.
Optical and J–V experiments
The absorption spectra of the gold films and the Chl coated films were recorded at room temperature using a UV-vis-NIR spectrometer (Varian Cary 5000). The time-resolved optical differential transmission (DT) spectra were measured using a pump–probe method. The excitation source was a mode-locked Ti/sapphire pulsed laser (Mira 900, Coherent) equipped with an optical frequency doubling system (HarmoniXX, APE GmbH) and an optical parametric oscillator (OPO) system. The laser had a pulse width of approximately 150 fs and a repetition rate of 76 MHz. A halogen tungsten lamp with an emission wavelength of about 450 nm–950 nm was used for the J–V measurements. The J–V curves of the solar cells were measured using an Electrochemical System (Versa STAT 3, Princeton Applied Research). The sample area was approximately 1 cm2.
Results and discussion
Plasmon-SSCs with varied SPR of the AuNFs
The morphology of the AuNFs with a 60 s deposition time was characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM) as shown in Fig. 1a. The AuNFs are composed of AuNPs with an average lateral diameter of ∼20 nm, an average height of ∼5 nm, and an average gap-distance of ∼5 nm. The SPR wavelength of the AuNFs is tuned from 550 to 780 nm by controlling the density of the NPs and the mass thickness of the Au film, which is determined by the deposition time td. The spectral width is significantly broadened and the SPR wavelength red-shifts as td increases from 10 to 120 s (see Fig. 1c).

The structure and electron transfer processes of the AuNF-SSCs are illustrated in Fig. 1b, where the ultrathin TiO2 film acting as the anode is directly deposited onto the transparent FTO conductive substrates, a Pt film is the counter anode, and I− ↔ I3− is used as the redox shuttle for the electrolyte. The SPR of the gold NPs induces a dipole and acts as an energy level to support the transition of photoelectrons under light excitation. Photoelectrons are transferred from the SPR level of an AuNP to the conduction band of the ultrathin TiO2 film, and are injected into the anode.
The charged AuNP is renewed by the donor from the electrolyte. The J–V curves of the AuNF-SSCs with tuned SPR are presented in Fig. 1d, which shows that both the open-circuit voltage Voc and short-circuit current Jsc of the cell increase as the SPR intensity increases.
The open-circuit voltage Voc is proportional to the built-in voltage, which increases as the SPR intensity increases and is also affected by the spectral resonant condition. The density of the photon-excited electrons (eg) is related to their excited energy level (ϕn),24 (1)where Cμ is the chemical effective capacity and Rrec is the reaction resistance. The short-circuit current of the cell has the relation: Jsc ∝ −eg ∝ Voc. As shown in Fig. 1c, Voc of the AuNF-SSCs increases from 60 mV to the maximum 126 mV as td increases to 90 s (λSPR = 709 nm), while Jsc increases from 13 μA cm−2 to the maximum 30 μA cm−2 as td increases to 100 s (λSPR = 739 nm). When the SPR becomes far from the visible region, both Jsc and Voc decrease.
Fano resonances of strongly coupled Au@Chl hybrids

Fig. 2a displays a schematic diagram of the metal–molecule (Au@Chl) hybrid system consisting of AuNFs decorated with Chl molecules. The Chl molecules have S- and Q-exciton absorption bands at around 420 and 660 nm, and are dispersed in solvent with concentrations, μdye, in the range of 1.5–250 μg mL−1 and then spin-coated onto the surface of the AuNFs. The absorption of the AuNFs in the regions of 300–500 nm and 500–900 nm is attributed to d-band bound electrons and SPR of free electrons, respectively, and the central peak of the SPR is tuned to ∼620 nm (Fig. 2b). The incoherent coupling of the S-band exciton of the Chl molecules with bound electrons of Au leads to a weak peak at around 420 nm, and the peak height is proportional to μdye.

(b) Fano lineshaped extinction spectra of the Au@Chl hybrids with bare fixed SPR (λSPR = 620 nm) and varied μdye ranging from 1.5 to 250 μg mL−1. The Fano dip is marked by the dotted line. (c–d) Fano amplitude aF and Fano factor q as a function of μdye. As μdye increases, the Fano dip (λdip) blue-shifts, and both aF and |q| increase. 
The coherent coupling of the Q-band excitons of the Chl molecules with SPR of the AuNFs leads to an asymmetric Fano resonance lineshape (see Fig. 2b). The Fano resonance as well as anti-resonance around the exciton absorption becomes prominent as the Chl concentration increases, while the plasmon peak around 620 nm increases a little. The normalized extinction spectrum of the Au@Chl hybrids around the Q-band of the Chl molecules is well reproduced by the Fano function,52,56 (2)where the Fano factor q is the shape parameter describing the degree of asymmetry; the Fano amplitude aF reflects the coherent coupling strength of two optical dipoles; ħω is photon energy; λ0 = c/2πω0 is the resonant wavelength; γ is the width of resonance; and σ′Au is the extinction spectra of the AuNFs modified by a constant dielectric dye layer without coherent effect. The calculation details of the q and aF parameters are shown in ESI Fig. S4.†

Eqn (2) indicates that the anti-resonance wavelength red-shifts as q increases and a Fano dip induced by anti-resonance occurs at ħωdip = ħω0 − qγ. From Fig. 2b–d, we found that the wavelength of the Fano dip (λdip) slightly blue-shifts from 655 to 645 nm and the Fano factor q decreases from −0.88 to −1.6, as the Chl concentration μdye increases from 5 to 250 μg mL−1. The Fano amplitude aF increases from 0.004 to 0.03, which indicates a stronger total plasmon–exciton coupling at a larger molecular concentration (Fig. 2c). This plexciton Fano resonance is not observed in the reference samples of Rhodamine B (RB) molecules coupled to the AuNFs (Au@RB hybrids, see ESI Fig. S1†).57
Then, the SPR wavelength of the AuNFs is tuned from 550 to 780 nm by controlling the density of the NPs and the mass thickness of the film, which is determined by the deposition time td. The spectral width is significantly broadened and the SPR wavelength almost linearly red-shifts as td increases from 10 to 120 s. The Chl molecules with a fixed concentration of 250 μg mL−1 are spin-coated onto the AuNFs and the extinction spectra of the Au@Chl hybrids are presented in Fig. 3a. The wavelengths of the Fano dip (λdip) and the left peak (λ+) are also approximately linearly-dependent on td. The wavelength of the right peak (λ−) slowly red-shifts from 665 to 685 nm as td increases from 10 to 80 s, and then dramatically increases from 685 to 800 nm as td increases from 80 s to 120 s.

AuNF SPR is adjusted by the sputtering deposition time (td). The Fano dip is marked by the dotted line. (b–c) Fano amplitude aF and Fano factor q as a function of λSPR (td). A prominent Fano resonance with a larger aF (= 2.75) and a smaller |q| (= 0.25) is obtained when λSPR ∼ 670 nm (td = 80 s). 
The Fano parameters q and aF are extracted from the extinction spectra of the Au@Chl hybrids. As shown in Fig. 3b and c, the absolute Fano factor |q| reaches the minimum 0.25 and the Fano amplitude aF reaches the maximum 0.15 when the bare SPR is around the excitonic absorption peak of the Chl molecules (∼670 nm).
Coherent energy transfer from plasmon to exciton
The Fano dip in the absorption spectrum of the plexciton hybrid indicates coherent plasmon resonance energy transfer (PRET) from the metal nanostructure to the dye molecules (see Fig. 4a). When the Fano factor q is equal to zero and the wavelength is around the Fano dip, the PRET is analytically described by using Manjavacas's quantum model,39 (3) (4) ΔEPRET ∝ σAu − σAu@Chl,(5)where σAu and σAu@Chl represent the absorption of AuNF plasmon resonances and Au@Chl hybrids, respectively, Δp and Δe describe the plasmon–light and plasmon–exciton coupling, respectively, ne represents the population of the excited state of the dye molecules, and δωp + iΓp/2 and δωe + iΓe/2 represent the energy level shifts of the AuNF plasmon and the molecular excitons caused by the environment, respectively.

Eqn (3)–(5) clearly reveal three important features of the PRET in the hybrids. (i) ΔEPRET increases as the dye concentration Cdye increases, because increasing Cdye effectively enlarges the coupling between the plasmon and exciton, and then induces a deeper anti-resonance Fano dip (see eqn (4)). (ii) The last term in eqn (4) reaches a maximum when ħω ≈ εe − δωe, which indicates that the Fano dip is around the molecular exciton resonance. (iii) The dip depth becomes prominent when the dip position is around the plasmon resonance.
Dynamics of the strongly coupled Au@Chl hybrids
In order to understand the coherent PRET from the metal nanostructure to dye molecules, we experimentally investigated the ultrafast dynamical processes of the Au@Chl hybrids using the time-resolved optical differential transmission (DT) method. The transient absorption spectra of Chl, the Au film, and the Au@Chl hybrid at 650 nm (Fano dip in hybrid) are shown in Fig. 4b. Chl displays no obvious signal because the amount of Chl molecules is too small. We observed a positive signal of ΔI for the AuNFs, which is caused by the transient saturated absorption of plasmons. As the width of the laser pulse used to excite the systems was ∼150 fs, the direct response of the plasmons within tens of fs cannot be observed. We can observe a decay process of ∼1 ps that corresponds to the decay of the hot electrons converted from the plasmons and attributed to the hot electron–phonon coupling within the AuNFs.
In contrast, the transient ΔI of the Au@Chl hybrid at the Fano dip exhibits a totally different response in the form of a negative signal. This means that the ground-state bleach effect of the plasmons is suppressed. The enhanced light absorption indicates that the excited-state energy could relax through another channel, PRET, in the strongly coupled Au@Chl hybrids. The ultrafast dynamical responses verify the efficient resonance energy transfer from the AuNFs to the Chl molecules and imply a high light-harvesting efficiency of solar cells utilizing plexciton Fano resonance.
Plexciton-SSCs based on Au@Chl hybrids
We demonstrate the performance of the plexciton-SSCs based on Au@Chl hybrids (Fig. 5a) and compare it with that of AuNF-SSCs. As shown in Fig. 5b and c, both Jsc and Voc of the Au@Chl-SSCs are prominently increased when the plasmon of the AuNFs is resonantly coupled with excitons from the Chl molecules, and eventually reach their maxima when λSPR = 709 nm (td = 90 s). The maximal Jsc of Au@Chl-SSCs increases by 66% while the maximal Voc increases by 37% compared to those of the AuNF-SSCs. It also shows that the Jsc and Voc of the Au@Chl-SSCs are slightly smaller than those of Chl-SSC when td < 30 s, which could be caused by the small size of the AuNPs and the far off-resonance of the plasmon and exciton.

An efficient channel of coherent PRET from metallic plasmons to molecular excitons enhances the light-harvesting efficiency of the SSCs. (b–c) Short-circuit current Jsc and open-circuit voltage Voc of bare AuNF-SSCs and Au@Chl-SSCs as a function of λSPR (td). (d) Maximal power Pmax of bare AuNF-SSCs (black line), Au@Chl-SSCs (red line) and Au@RB-SSCs (green line) as a function of λSPR (td). Pmax increases by ∼180% with Chl molecules via plexciton Fano resonance but decreases by ∼70% with RB molecules without Fano resonance. The Pmax values of bare Chl-SSC, TiO2-SSC and RB-SSC are marked by horizontal lines. 
The SPR-dependent maximal power (Pmax) of the cells, calculated from the product of the V–P curves, is presented in Fig. 5d. The maximal Pmax values of the AuNF-SSC and Au@Chl-SSC (at λSPR = 709 nm/td = 90 s) are measured to be 0.6 and 1.3 μW, and those of the Chl-SSC and bare TiO2-SSC are approximately 0.3 and 0.1 μW. Therefore, the maximal Pmax of the Au@Chl-SSC is 62% larger than the sum of the individual bare AuNF-SSC and Chl-SSC. This indicates that the plexciton-SSC with strong Fano resonance more efficiently transfers the photoelectrons to the anode of the cell.
Discussion
In order to demonstrate the efficient energy transfer path from plasmons to dye molecules, the micro-structure and plasmons of the AuNFs are carefully adjusted to achieve strong resonance coupling between the dye molecules and the AuNFs. The performance of the Au@RB-SSCs without Fano resonance is comparatively investigated (see Fig. 5d and ESI Fig. S2†). It is found that both the photocurrent and voltage of the AuNF-SSCs are suppressed by the RB molecules. In this case, the energy transfer channel from the AuNFs to the RB molecules does not exist since the Fano dip is not observed in the absorption spectrum (aF = 0). The plasmon-induced photoelectrons in the AuNFs partially inject into the semiconductor, but the coated RB molecule decreases the renew rate of the charged AuNFs and results in a reduction in the photocurrent of the AuNF-SSC.
Improving the performance of the AuNF-SSCs by using Chl molecules includes two key aspects: (i) efficient energy transfer from the metallic plasmons to the molecular excitons and (ii) efficient electron transfer from the dye molecules to the semiconductor anode. A larger ΔEPRET could be expected for the plexciton Fano resonance with a larger aF and a q closer to zero. Our results also show that the natural Chl molecules with porphyrin rings and long hydrocarbon tails have better directional electron transfer behaviors than RB dye molecules, but the underlying physical mechanisms need to be further studied.
Conclusions
In summary, the photocurrent of bare plasmon-SSCs consisting of AuNFs and ultrathin TiO2 films increases as the SPR absorption increases. The plexciton Fano resonances of the strongly coupled AuNFs and Chl molecules are tuned by adjusting the molecular coverage and SPR of the AuNFs. This strong plexciton coupling leads to prominent enhancements of the short-circuit current Jsc, open-circuit voltage Voc, and maximal power Pmax of the plexciton-SSCs. A further improvement in the performance of plexciton-SSCs can be achieved when the strongly coupled plexciton hybrids with optimized nanostructures have a more prominent Fano dip, which has prospective applications in plasmonic solar cells in the future.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) AFM image showing the morphology of the AuNFs. (b) Charge transfer channel from bare plasmon to cell anodes and the mechanism of plasmon-SSCs. (c) Extinction spectra of AuNFs with different deposition times. (d) SPR-dependent J–V curves of the AuNF-SSCs.	 
	(1)

 	Fig. 2  (a) Schematic illustration of the AuNFs decorated with Chl molecules. Inset: chemical structure of a Chl molecule. (b) Fano lineshaped extinction spectra of the Au@Chl hybrids with bare fixed SPR (λSPR = 620 nm) and varied μdye ranging from 1.5 to 250 μg mL−1. The Fano dip is marked by the dotted line. (c–d) Fano amplitude aF and Fano factor q as a function of μdye. As μdye increases, the Fano dip (λdip) blue-shifts, and both aF and |q| increase.	 
	(2)

 	Fig. 3  Tunable plexciton Fano resonance of Au@Chl hybrids with varied SPR. (a) Extinction spectra of Au@Chl hybrids (μdye = 250 μg mL−1). AuNF SPR is adjusted by the sputtering deposition time (td). The Fano dip is marked by the dotted line. (b–c) Fano amplitude aF and Fano factor q as a function of λSPR (td). A prominent Fano resonance with a larger aF (= 2.75) and a smaller |q| (= 0.25) is obtained when λSPR ∼ 670 nm (td = 80 s).

ΔEPRET ∝ σAu − σAu@Chl,	(5)

 	Fig. 4  (a) Schematic diagram and energy transfer mechanism of the Au@Chl hybrids. (b) Transient absorption spectra of Chl, the Au film, and the Au@Chl hybrid at 650 nm, which is the wavelength of the Fano dip of the Au@Chl hybrid.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Charge and energy transfer channel(s) from the hybrid plexciton to the cell anodes. An efficient channel of coherent PRET from metallic plasmons to molecular excitons enhances the light-harvesting efficiency of the SSCs. (b–c) Short-circuit current Jsc and open-circuit voltage Voc of bare AuNF-SSCs and Au@Chl-SSCs as a function of λSPR (td). (d) Maximal power Pmax of bare AuNF-SSCs (black line), Au@Chl-SSCs (red line) and Au@RB-SSCs (green line) as a function of λSPR (td). Pmax increases by ∼180% with Chl molecules via plexciton Fano resonance but decreases by ∼70% with RB molecules without Fano resonance. The Pmax values of bare Chl-SSC, TiO2-SSC and RB-SSC are marked by horizontal lines.
