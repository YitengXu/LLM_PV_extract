    , Accepted 13th March 2021First published on 14th March 2021AbstractTerpolymers have been proven to be promising polymer donors for organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the aperiodic sequence distribution caused by random copolymerization dramatically interrupts the orderly stacking of the conjugated main chain. In this work, we reported three terpolymers by introducing Si and Cl functionalized benzodithiophene (BDT-SiCl) into a polymer PM6 matrix with F functionalized benzodithiophene (BDT-2F) by random copolymerization. BDT-SiCl has the same skeleton as BDT-2F, but only differs in functional atoms on the side chain. The structural similarity of the two building blocks not only can minimize the disturbance of the molecular orderly packing caused by random copolymerization, but also can enhance the face-on orientation of the active layer to facilitate charge transport. Moreover, the alkylsilyl and chlorine atom enable the terpolymers to have a lower HOMO level and broadened light absorption compared to PM6. As a result, the terpolymer-based OSCs achieve the best efficiency of 16.22% with a small energy loss of 0.50 eV, yielding overall improved device parameters compared to PM6-based devices. In addition, thanks to the chemical bond linkage, the terpolymer-based device has a higher thermal stability than its corresponding ternary OSC. These results demonstrate that the design concept of structural similarity is a promising strategy to construct terpolymers for high-performance OSCs.
1. Introduction
With the development of organic solar cells (OSCs) from the initial single-layer Schottky solar cells to the current mainstream bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have made a qualitative leap.1–3 Moreover, OSCs have attracted wide attention because of their unique advantages, such as low cost, light weight, and large area flexible photovoltaic devices that can be manufactured by roll-to-roll printing.4–8 In an OSC device, the active layer of BHJ plays a decisive role in PCEs. The active layer includes a p-type semiconductor as an electron donor and an n-type semiconductor as an electron acceptor. Among these n-type acceptors, small-molecule acceptors have attracted extensive attention due to their strong absorption, easy-to-adjust energy levels and good reproducibility. In recent years, some advanced non-fullerene small molecule acceptors with strong near infrared ray (NIR) absorption, e.g. IT-4F, Y6 and their derivatives, have been successfully developed, making single-layer devices with a breakthrough PCE of over 18%.9–14 On the other hand, polymer PM6 is a presentative polymer donor that is mostly used to blend with these acceptors as the active layers of the state-of-the-art OSCs. These devices achieve a high short circuit current density (JSC), but normally have a low open circuit voltage (VOC) of about 0.80–0.85 eV.15–17 This is because the NIR absorption of these acceptors boosts the photocurrent, but their lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels result in the loss of device voltage. Therefore, to gain a high VOC of the devices, polymer donors possessing a deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level are very desirable. However, such efficient low-lying HOMO donors are very scarce.
The general strategy for developing new donors is to construct donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers by alternating copolymerization of donor units (D) and acceptor units (A). Adjusting the main chain structure, tuning the length of the side chain and introducing functional atoms of D–A copolymers are effective methods to manipulate their energy levels, light absorption, solubility and molecular packing.18–21 But these methods usually involve very complex synthesis. Another alternative way is to construct ternary devices by incorporating a third component into the active layer of binary OSCs. The role of the third component in the ternary blending can be a donor or acceptor to adjust the devices' parameters, such as VOC, JSC and fill factor (FF).22–25 Nonetheless, the incorporation of the extra third component usually causes a more complicated phase morphology, which may reduce the stability of the device to a degree.26 Recently, developing terpolymers as active layer materials has been proven to be an effective and simple promising method for the development of high-efficiency polymer donors.27–34 In the terpolymer-based active layer, the third component is not introduced by physically blending but by covalent bonding, which is expected to obviously improve the stability and reduce the phase complexity. Covalently linking the third unit into D–A copolymers thus keeps the advantages of both the ternary blend and the binary blend. At the same time, we also can easily regulate the photovoltaic properties of the terpolymers by tuning the feeding ratio of each component without complex molecular design. At present, there are two types of random copolymerization: one is D–A1–A2 and the other is D1–D2–A. D–A1–A2 represents the use of the same electron donating unit and different electron withdrawing units (A1 and A2) for random copolymerization. D1–D2–A means using the same electron withdrawing unit and two different electron donating units (D1 and D2) for random copolymerization.35 In recent years, our group have developed a series of D–A1–A2 terpolymers with an electron donating unit and two different electron withdrawing units (A1 and A2) for OSCs by introducing A2 as the third component into D–A copolymer donors or acceptors via random copolymerization.36,37 It can be found that by simply adjusting each unit structure and ratio, the light absorption, the energy level and the film topography of the resulting terpolymers and corresponding active layer can be well tuned, which can effectively improve the JSC, VOC and FF of the devices.
Although terpolymers has been proven to improve the photovoltaic properties of the devices in some cases, the aperiodic sequence distribution caused by the random copolymerization of the three units with quite different structures will also interrupt the orderly stacking of the conjugated main chain. A too disordered arrangement always greatly reduces the charge transport.27 Therefore, we have to compromise between the advantages of the random terpolymers and the interruption of the aperiodic sequence distribution. The rational design of terpolymers by carefully selecting building blocks and controlling the molar ratios of each unit becomes more and more critical to guarantee high performance of the resulting devices.
Considering the excellent photovoltaic properties and insufficient VOC of the devices with PM6, in this work, we create a series of PM6-based D1–D2–A terpolymers with two donor units (silicon (Si) and chlorine (Cl) atom functionalized benzodithiophene (BDT-SiCl) and fluorine (F) atom functionalized benzodithiophene (BDT-2F)) and one acceptor unit (benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD)) by random copolymerization. In such new terpolymers, BDT-SiCl as the third unit has the same skeleton as the donor unit BDT-2F, but only differs in functional atoms on the side chain. The structural similarity of BDT-SiCl and BDT-2F not only can minimize the disturbance of the molecular orderly packing caused by random copolymerization, but also can enhance the face-on orientation and induce a more favorable morphology of the active layer to facilitate charge transport, when an appropriate ratio of BDT-SiCl is introduced into the PM6 bipolymer matrix. At the same time, the empty 3d orbital of the chlorine atom and the σ*(Si)–π*(C) bonding interaction can effectively reduce the energy level to boost the VOC and ensure a good crystallinity of the terpolymer for charge transport as well.20,38–41 As a result, the terpolymer-based solar cell with a 10% molar ratio of BDT-SiCl achieves the best PCE of 16.22%, yielding overall improved device parameters compared to PM6-based devices. The enhancement in the efficiency is attributed to the reduced HOMO levels, broadened light utilization, optimized morphology and reduced energy loss (Eloss), which is evaluated by highly sensitive external quantum efficiency (sEQE), electroluminescence and EQEEL experiments. Moreover, thanks to the chemical bond linked system, the terpolymer-based device has a higher thermal stability than its corresponding ternary OSC.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Materials design and structural characterization
We have synthesized a series of random copolymers named PM6-SiCl-10% (mole ratio of BDT-2F:BDT-SiCl = 90:10), PM6-SiCl-15% (mole ratio of BDT-2F:BDT-SiCl = 85:15), and PM6-SiCl-20% (mole ratio of BDT-2F:BDT-SiCl = 80:20), which have different mole ratios of the electron-donating D1 and D2 units (BDT-2F and BDT-SiCl). All terpolymers are prepared according to the synthetic route provided in Scheme 1, through the Stille coupling reaction in toluene solvent with Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst. Then the crude product was precipitated in methanol, followed by Soxhlet extraction with hexane, acetone and chloroform, respectively, and finally purified by using a silica gel column. The structures of the monomer and polymers were confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and elemental analysis (Fig. S1–S4†). The molecular weights of terpolymers were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at a high temperature of 150 °C. The number average molecular weights (Mn) of the terpolymers with 10% and 15% mole ratios of BDT-SiCl are around 32–36 kDa, and the polydispersity index (PDIs) is around 2.1–2.3 (Table 1 and Fig. S5†). Due to the high crystallinity of BDT-SiCl, the terpolymer PM6-SiCl-20% with 20% BDT-SiCl shows much poorer solubility. To ensure good solvent processing, PM6-SiCl-20% with a lower molecular weight of 23 kDa was used for device fabrication. In addition, a high thermal stability was observed in the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the terpolymers (Fig. S6†), and the decomposition temperature (Td) was above 400 °C with a 5% weight loss.

2.2 Optical and electrochemical properties

Fig. 1a and b show the UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of the copolymers PM6, PM6-SiCl-10%, PM6-SiCl-15% and PM6-SiCl-20%. All copolymers show defined absorption profiles with a peak at about 612 nm for solution samples and about 618 nm for film states. From solutions to films, all copolymers have a slight red-shift in the absorption spectra, indicating that the films have higher crystallinity in the solid states. In addition, for both solutions and films, terpolymers and PM6 have the same absorption edge, but the terpolymers have a slightly blue-shifted band in the short wavelength region relative to PM6. Such a blue-shifted band of the terpolymers is also accompanied by a gradually increased shoulder peak at 574 nm as the amount of BDT-SiCl increases, which would enhance the capture of light in the short wavelength region. The optical band gaps (Eoptg) estimated from the film absorption edges are about 1.83, 1.83, 1.83 and 1.84 eV for PM6, PM6-SiCl-10%, PM6-SiCl-15% and PM6-SiCl-20%, respectively (Table 1). Fig. 1b shows that these terpolymers have a good complementary absorption with the Y6 acceptor, indicating that the corresponding blend films can cover a wide spectral range from 300 to 900 nm. These favorable optical characteristics are the basis for improving photocurrent.

Simulation calculations were performed to investigate the geometric configuration and frontier molecular orbitals of the copolymers through density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. As shown in Fig. 2a, the alternating D–A copolymer PM6 displays a planar structure, which is favorable for charge transport. When incorporating BDT-SiCl into the backbone, the similar structures of BDT-SiCl and BDT-2F exert negligible influence on the geometric configuration of the backbone. The HOMO and LUMO levels were calculated through DFT. Compared with those of PM6 (HOMO: −4.99 eV; LUMO: −2.70 eV), the HOMO and LUMO of the terpolymers are significantly reduced after replacing one BDT-2F unit with one BDT-SiCl unit (HOMO: −5.03 eV; LUMO: −2.86 eV) (Fig. 2b). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was also used to investigate the real HOMO levels of the materials. The corresponding energy level diagram is shown in Fig. 1d and Table 1. The HOMOs are −5.45, −5.53, −5.54 and −5.55 eV for PM6, PM6-SiCl-10%, PM6-SiCl-15% and PM6-SiCl-20%, respectively. Compared with PM6, the introduction of alkylsilyl and chlorine atoms leads to significantly deeper HOMO levels of the terpolymers. Moreover, as the content of alkylsilyl and chlorine atoms gradually increases, the HOMO level gradually decreases. These observations are consistent with DFT calculations. The deeper HOMOs of the terpolymers are more conducive to stabilizing the materials and improving the VOC of the OSCs. According to Eoptg, LUMOs are calculated to be −3.65, −3.70, −3.71 and −3.71 eV for PM6, PM6-SiCl-10%, PM6-SiCl-15% and PM6-SiCl-20%, respectively.

2.3 Photovoltaic performance and charge dynamics
In order to investigate the photovoltaic performance of this series of terpolymers, we fabricated OSCs with a conventional device structure: ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/PDINO/Al. Optimization operations including adjusting the D/A ratio, concentration, spinning speed, annealing temperature and annealing time were performed to get the best devices. Fig. 3a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimized devices. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. The PM6:Y6-based control device produces a PCE of 15.41%, with a VOC of 0.842 V, a JSC of 25.18 mA cm−2 and an FF of 72.67%, which is equivalent to the reported result.5 For the terpolymer-based devices, the VOC values are remarkably enhanced relative to that of control devices. The improvement of VOC is consistent with the reduced HOMO levels of the terpolymers as well as the reduction of Eloss in the devices (discussed later).42 From PM6-SiCl-10% to PM6-SiCl-15% to PM6-SiCl-20%, the VOC value increases significantly from 0.870 to 0.881 V with the content of BDT-SiCl increasing, in good agreement with the tendency of their HOMO levels. The best PCE of 16.22% accompanied by overall improved device parameters (VOC = 0.870 V, JSC = 25.37 mA cm−2 and FF = 73.48%) has been achieved for the PM6-SiCl-10%:Y6-based device with a 10% mole ratio of BDT-SiCl. Further increasing the BDT-SiCl content to 15% results in a slight drop in the device efficiency (VOC = 0.875 V, JSC = 25.26 mA cm−2, FF = 70.03% and PCE = 15.48%), but is still comparable to that of the PM6:Y6-based device. When improving the BDT-SiCl content to 20%, the efficiency of the PM6-SiCl-20%:Y6-based device (VOC = 0.881 V, JSC = 24.88 mA cm−2, FF = 67.24% and PCE = 14.73%) shows a detectable decrease. It can be observed that excessive introduction of the third unit causes a significant decrease in the FF.

Apart from the VOC values, the JSC values of these devices are also found to be improved in the PM6-SiCl-10% and PM6-SiCl-15% based devices. Such a delightful result is opposite to the common observation with a trade-off of VOC and JSC. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of all cells are shown in Fig. 3b. Table 2 shows the integrated JSC values from the EQE spectra, which are very consistent with those of the J–V curves within 3% error. The device based on PM6-SiCl-10%:Y6 is found to have the highest photo-response, which is responsible for the highest JSC. Note that all terpolymers display higher EQE values than PM6 in the short wavelength region of 380–460 nm, in accordance with the slightly blue-shifted absorption bands of the terpolymers, as revealed by UV spectra. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded to probe the charge separation process in solar cells, as shown in Fig. S7.† It can be seen that for all blend films, similar to the case of PM6, the PL of PM6-SiCl with different ratios of BDT-SiCl can be completely quenched by the Y6 acceptor, indicating the ultra-fast charge transfer in terpolymer blend systems.
High and balance charge carrier mobilities are also critical for obtaining high JSC and FF. The hole and electron mobilities were evaluated by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method with ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/MoO3/Ag and ITO/ZnO/active layer/PDINO/Al, respectively. The hole (μh,SCLC) and electron (μe,SCLC) mobilities are summarized in Fig. S8 and Table S1.† The hole mobilities are 3.08 × 10−3, 3.23 × 10−3, 3.19 × 10−3 and 2.99 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PM6:Y6, PM6-SiCl-10%:Y6, PM6-SiCl-15%:Y6 and PM6-SiCl-20%:Y6 respectively. The electron mobilities are 2.02 × 10−3, 2.15 × 10−3, 2.05 × 10−3 and 1.77 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PM6:Y6, PM6-SiCl-10%:Y6, PM6-SiCl-15%:Y6 and PM6-SiCl-20%:Y6 respectively. The hole and electron mobilities of PM6-SiCl-10%:Y6 and PM6-SiCl-15%:Y6 are slightly higher than those of PM6:Y6, corresponding to their relatively high JSC. Due to the excessively introduced BDT-SiCl causing less ordered stacking and a poorer pathway for charge transport, the hole and electron mobilities of PM6-SiCl-20%:Y6 are reduced. In addition, the hole and electron mobilities of PM6-SiCl-10%:Y6 show a slightly better balance of μh/μe (1.50) than those of PM6:Y6 (1.52). The balanced charge transfer indicates the reduced accumulation and recombination of space charges, resulting in an improvement in FF. Therefore, the PM6-SiCl-10%:Y6-based device has a higher FF than PM6:Y6. The FF of PM6-SiCl-15%:Y6 and PM6-SiCl-20%:Y6-based devices is reduced on account of the increased μh/μe (1.55 and 1.68 for PM6-SiCl-15%:Y6 and PM6-SiCl-20%:Y6 respectively).
To investigate the charge recombination in OSCs, we researched the relationship between JSC and the light intensity (P) (Fig. 3c), which can be described by the power law formula JSC ∝ Plightα. Generally, when the index α is closer to 1, the bimolecular recombination in the devices is weaker. The index α values are 0.953, 0.962, 0.958 and 0.952 for PM6:Y6, PM6-SiCl-10%:Y6, PM6-SiCl-15%:Y6 and PM6-SiCl-20%:Y6, respectively. The index α of the PM6-SiCl-10%:Y6 based device is the closest value to 1, indicating that a 10% loading of BDT-SiCl units inhibits bimolecular recombination, which helps to obtain the highest JSC. Moreover, the slopes of VOC ∝ lnPlight are shown in Fig. S9† to further investigate the charge recombination mechanism of OSCs. A slope of kT/q for VOC ∝ lnPlight implies the free-carrier bimolecular recombination, while a slope of 2kT/q suggests that trap-assisted recombination dominates in OSCs. The slope based on the PM6-SiCl-10%:Y6 device is the closest value to 1 (1.46 kT/q, 1.32 kT/q, 1.33 kT/q and 1.34 kT/q for PM6:Y6, PM6-SiCl-10%:Y6, PM6-SiCl-15%:Y6 and PM6-SiCl-20%:Y6, respectively), which implies that a 10% loading of BDT-SiCl units can suppress trap-assisted recombination of devices and thus improve JSC. The saturated Jph (Jsat), exciton dissociation efficiency (ηdiss) and charge collection efficiency (ηcoll) can be estimated from the Jph–Veff curve (Fig. 3d). The results are shown in Table S2,† where the ηdiss values of the devices based on PM6:Y6, PM6-SiCl-10%:Y6, PM6-SiCl-15%:Y6 and PM6-SiCl-20%:Y6 are 96.1%, 96.4%, 96.3%, and 95.3%, respectively. The ηcoll values based on PM6:Y6, PM6-SiCl-10%:Y6, PM6-SiCl-15%:Y6 and PM6-SiCl-20%:Y6 are 81.5%, 84.3%, 81.7%, and 77.3%, respectively. This indicates that despite the small driving force between the energy levels of the donor and acceptor, the charge transfer process in the active layer is still effective.
2.4 Morphology characterization
An atomic force microscope (AFM) experiment was conducted to investigate the morphology and phase separation (Fig. S10†). As shown in the images, the PM6:Y6 blend film shows a uniform and smooth surface morphology, with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.01 nm. After introducing BDT-SiCl into the copolymer, the terpolymer-based blend films still show a smooth surface, but with slightly increased RMS roughness as the loading of BDT-SiCl increases. A grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) experiment was used to further obtain the active layer packing structure information (Fig. 4, S11, Tables S3 and S4†). As shown in the figures, the neat and blend films have a clear sharp (100) reflection in the in-plane direction, and a π–π stacking (010) peak in the out-of-plane direction. Such profiles indicate that all the films have a dominant face-on orientation, facilitating the charge transport. Different ratios of copolymerization units distinctly affect the packing peak area and crystal coherence length (CCL). When 10% BDT-SiCl is introduced, the terpolymer displays an equal π–π stacking distance of 3.76 Å to PM6, but has a stronger π–π stacking signal (Fig. S11b†). More BDT-SiCl incorporation results in a reduced packing in the face-on orientation, as revealed by the gradually blurring patterns of PM6-SiCl-15% and PM6-SiCl-20% (Fig. S11c and d†). Among these polymer donors, including terpolymers and PM6, PM6-SiCl-10% shows the longest crystal coherence length of 23.14 Å and a minimum full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.247 Å−1 for the π–π stacking (010) peak in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, indicating that introducing appropriate loadings of the third unit with a similar structure to the blocks of the bipolymer matrix is favorable to enhance the crystallinity of the resulting terpolymer.

The morphological evolution of the blend films exhibits a similar trend to that of neat films. As seen from the scattering patterns of the blend films (Fig. 4), the PM6-SiCl-10%:Y6 blend film has the strongest π–π stacking signal. Intriguingly, compared with the PM6:Y6 blend film, PM6-SiCl-10%:Y6 even shows much more distinct peaks at 0.24 and 0.45 Å−1, accompanied by a larger CCL (87.82 Å) of the (100) peak (Fig. 4e and Table S4†). The enhanced peak at 0.45 Å−1 can be assigned to the signal of Y6 (Fig. 4e and S12b†). These results imply that incorporating an appropriate content of BDT-SiCl into the polymer donor not only can promote the ordering packing of the polymer donor, but also can favor a better organization of the acceptor, contributing to simultaneously improved electron and hole mobilities. Excessive BDT-SiCl units involved in the copolymers are found to destroy the packing arrangement of the blend films, due to the disordered sequence caused by random copolymerization.
2.5 Energy loss in the devices
As reducing Eloss has become a promising route to achieve a high VOC without sacrificing JSC, we have performed more studies on device physics. From previous studies, a large driving force in OSCs can facilitate efficient exciton splitting, but cause a problematic trade-off between the VOC and JSC of the devices, which limits the maximum achievable efficiency of OSCs.43 Therefore, it is important for an OSC device to obtain a high VOC by reducing the driving force but still possessing effective exciton separation. The driving force (ΔEHOMO and ΔELUMO) is normally determined by the difference between the HOMO/LUMO levels of the donor and the HOMO/LUMO levels of the acceptor, but as a matter of fact it is closely related to the energy of the charge transfer state (ECT) in the BHJ system. A higher ECT means a smaller driving force. In addition to reducing the energy loss, another way is to reduce the radiative and non-radiative recombination related energy losses to further increase the VOC. In fact, the total Eloss of OSCs can be divided into three parts: (1) ΔE1, charge transfer (CT) loss (driving force); (2) ΔE2, radiative recombination energy loss; (3) ΔE3, non-radiative recombination energy loss.44 To gain further insight into the reasons for the increase of the VOC, we analyze the detailed Eloss in both PM6 and PM6-SiCl-10%-based devices by highly sensitive external quantum efficiency (sEQE), electroluminescence and EQEEL experiments.
First, we estimated the optical bandgaps (Eg) from the intersections between the normalized absorption and emission spectra of the low bandgap Y6.45 As shown in Fig. S13,† the Eg is calculated to be 1.37 eV. Besides, highly sensitive EQE spectra (sEQE) and electroluminescence (EL) spectra were recorded to deduce the ECT and thus estimate the ΔE1 (defined as Eg − ECT) of devices (Fig. 5a and b). The ECT values of PM6:Y6 and PM6-SiCl-10%:Y6 based devices are 1.33 eV and 1.34 eV, respectively (Table 3). Therefore, the ΔE1 of the PM6-SiCl-10%:Y6 based device (0.03 eV) is smaller than that of the PM6:Y6 based device (0.04 eV), indicating that only a small Eloss occurs during the formation of CT states.46 Then we measured the EQEEL of the devices to evaluate the ΔE3, which can be evaluated using the following equation: ΔE3 = −kTln(EQEEL) (k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature).47 As shown in Fig. 5c, both devices display high EQEEL values (1.46 × 10−4 for PM6:Y6 and 2.75 × 10−4 for PM6-SiCl-10%:Y6). Then the calculated ΔE3 is 0.22 eV for the PM6:Y6 and 0.21 eV for the PM6-SiCl-10%:Y6 based device (Table 3). The slightly reduced non-radiation energy loss also contributes to the increase in VOC. Finally, the ΔE2 was evaluated according to the following equation: ΔE2 = ECT − qVOC − ΔE3. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, no additional emission peaks are observed from the CT state which is beneficial to reduce ΔE2. This phenomenon is usually observed in high-efficiency NFA systems with low-energy offsets.48 Compared with the PM6:Y6 device (ΔE2 = 0.27 eV), the PM6-SiCl-10%:Y6 device exhibits a slightly reduced ΔE2 of 0.26 eV (Table 3). As a whole, the PM6-SiCl-10%:Y6-based device not only successfully reduced the driving force but also suppressed the radiative and non-radiative energy loss. The total energy loss (0.5 eV) is low , less than that of the PM6:Y6-based device, and hence the negative trade-off between VOC and JSC can be well controlled.

2.6 Device stability
In addition to efficiency, stability is also a key factor considered in the practical application of OSCs. Since the third unit BDT-SiCl was introduced by covalent bonding, we speculate that such a hard bond linked system should be more stable than the physical blending system. We thus synthesized an alternating D–A copolymer PBDT-SiCl by polymerization of BDT-SiCl and BDD units, that is, in the new polymer PBDT-SiCl, the donor units BDT-2F in PM6 are completely replaced by BDT-SiCl. We further compared the stability of the terpolymer (PM6-SiCl-10%):Y6 and the corresponding ternary OSCs with that of PM6: PBDT-SiCl:Y6 with the same content of BDT-SiCl as the terpolymer. The stability was tested under high temperature (110 °C) thermal treatment. It can be observed that the best efficiency of the ternary OSCs is 16.17%, with a VOC of 0.863 V, a JSC of 25.30 mA cm−2 and an FF of 74.04% (Fig. S14 and Table S5†). Upon the thermal treatment with different times, apart from the slightly reduced JSC, the other device parameters of ternary OSCs including PCE, VOC and FF are found to decrease much more than those of the terpolymer-based binary device (Fig. S15 and Table S6†). After 480 min of annealing at 110 °C, the ternary OSC has a VOC of 0.815 V, an FF of 64.61% and a PCE of 13.14%, 7.4%, 12.7% and 18.7% smaller compared to the highest values of the devices, respectively. Meanwhile the terpolymer has a VOC of 0.831 V, an FF of 67.45% and a PCE of 14.01%, 5.4%, 8.2% and 13.6% smaller compared to the highest values of the devices, respectively (Fig. 6). These results demonstrate that the covalent bond linked terpolymer system enables higher stability than the ternary blend system.

3. Conclusion
In summary, we have developed three terpolymers PM6-SiCl by incorporating a third unit BDT-SiCl into the PM6 backbone. The similar structure of BDT-SiCl and BDT-2F donor units can minimize the disturbance of the molecular orderly packing caused by random copolymerization. An enhanced face-on orientation and more favorable morphology are observed for both terpolymer neat and blend films. On the other hand, due to the alkylsilyl and chlorine atom in BDT-SiCl, all terpolymers show lower HOMO levels and broadened light utilization than PM6. As a result, the terpolymer-based solar cell with a 10% molar ratio of BDT-SiCl achieves the best PCE of 16.22%, yielding overall improved device parameters compared to PM6-based devices. The enhancement in the efficiency is attributed to the reduced HOMO levels, broadened light utilization, optimized morphology and reduced Eloss. Moreover, the terpolymer-based device has a higher thermal stability than its corresponding ternary OSC because of the chemical bond linkage. It demonstrates that the design concept of structural similarity is a promising strategy to construct terpolymers for high-performance OSCs.
