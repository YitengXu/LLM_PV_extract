    , Accepted 16th December 2010First published on 16th February 2011AbstractWe have synthesized a new series of donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) π-conjugated molecules, consisting of fluorenone core end-capped with dendritic oligo(thiophene)s of increasing generation (abbreviated as FG0, FG1, and FG2). In view of the application of these new organic semiconductors in photovoltaic devices, we have explored their spectroscopic, redox, and structural properties. The thermal behaviour of the new organic semiconductors was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and polarized-light optical microscopy. Liquid crystalline behaviour has been found in the case of FG1, corresponding to a smectic ordering with a triclinic symmetry (Smobl) upon heating, as confirmed by variable temperature small-angle X-ray diffraction studies. In order to evaluate their photovoltaic performances, devices with an active area of 0.28 cm2 were fabricated. Under AM1.5 simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2) conditions, a device containing FG1/[70]PCBM blends showed a power conversion efficiency of ca. 0.8%.
1. Introduction
Organic semiconducting materials showing efficient opto-electronic and modulable self-organisation properties have been the focus of an impressive number of studies during the past two decades because of their integration as electroactive components into photovoltaic cells,1 light-emitting diodes2 or field-effect transistors.3 Among these applications, organic semiconductors are of particular interest for the fabrication of bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells.4 Among others, this interest relies on their ease to process which facilitates the fabrication of large area, flexible, quasi defect-free (e.g. self-healing), and low-cost modules.5 Up to now, BHJ organic solar cells based on solution-processed materials have been dominated by polymers. However recently, the concept of molecular BHJ has been introduced,6 and several research groups have reported promising photovoltaic performances for organic solar cells in which the active layer was prepared by solution processing.7 Molecular electron-donating materials reveal several advantages, as compared to their polymeric counterparts, in terms of synthesis, purification, simplicity of processing, and tuning of their chemical structure.8 Lately, dendritic materials or hyperbranched π-conjugated compounds have been successfully employed as electron donor components in BHJ organic solar cells.9 It has been clearly demonstrated that increasing the size of oligo(thiophene) dendrons (i.e. their generation number), used for the preparation of the thiophene-based dendrimers, resulted in a systematic increase in device performance, which was hypothesised to originate from an improvement of the carrier's mobility.10 On the other hand, thiophene-based dendrimers usually present large band gap, as compared to linear systems of comparable polymerization degree. This observation can be explained by the limited electronic π-conjugation originating from the steric hindrance and twisting between the adjacent thiophene units. Therefore, strategies to decrease the band gap of these materials and, as a consequence, to improve their light-harvesting properties, have attracted the attention of several research groups.11
Our group has recently reported the preparation and application in a bulk-heterojunction organic solar cell of a new class of small molecules containing fluorenone units. Devices containing these compounds blended with [60]PCBM yielded a maximum power conversion efficiency of 1.2%. Motivated by these results and inspired by the investigations on dendritic materials reported by other groups, we have focused our attention on the design and the synthesis of donor–acceptor molecules containing a fluorenone central unit symmetrically coupled to oligo(thiophene) segments end-capped with dendritic oligo(thiophene) wedges. A combination of alkylated oligothiophene dendrons attached to a fluorenone central unit via a linear oligo(thiophene) linker is expected to provide highly soluble materials showing an extended absorption spectral range in the visible part thanks to the emergence of an internal charge-transfer (ICT) absorption band.12 On the other hand, the electron affinity of the fluorenone unit and the electron releasing character of the oligo(thiophene) segments should in principle lead to a molecular system whose frontier orbital HOMO and LUMO are well-positioned with regard to those of [60]PCBM, allowing the occurrence of the photo-induced charge transfer between the two semiconductors. Herein, we present the synthesis of such molecules containing end-capping oligothiophene dendrons up to the second generation. We also report on their optical and electrochemical behaviour. In order to optimise the fabrication of organic optoelectronic devices, it is highly desirable to understand the effect of thermal annealing treatment on the structuration of these compounds. Consequently, their thermal behaviour has also been investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), polarized-light optical microscopy (POM), and small-angle X-ray diffraction (SAXD). The presence of a mesophase with a triclinic symmetry (Smobl) was confirmed for the compound based on the first generation of oligo(thiophene) dendron (FG1). Finally, we report preliminary results obtained in test photovoltaic cells and demonstrate the applicability of these molecules as donor components in molecular bulk-heterojunction solar cells.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Material synthesis
The overall synthetic strategy developed thereafter relies on the efficient palladium-catalyzed Stille coupling reaction. The preparation of the symmetric donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) type compounds, containing a fluorenone central unit and peripheral thiophene based electron-rich segments, consisted of the direct attachment of the two oligo(thiophene)-based dendron residues at the last stage of the synthetic protocol (orthogonal methodology). Oligo(thiophene) dendrons, up to the second generation (1-G0, 3-G1 and 5-G2, Scheme 1), and their stannyl derivatives (2, 4 and 6, Scheme 1) were synthesized by a convergent synthetic route according to literature methods13 starting from 2,3-dibromothiophene by iterative palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction. Briefly, 2-stannyl-5-octylthiophene (2) was synthesized by treatment of 2-octylthiophene (1-G0) with butyllithium and trimethyltin chloride. Due to the high toxicity of trimethyltin derivatives, the crude product was merely washed with ammonium chloride aqueous solution and used without further purification. The dendritic percursor 3-G1 was obtained in excellent yield (88%) by the Stille coupling method between (2) and 2,3-dibromothiophene.

Using a similar procedure, 5-G2 compound was obtained in good yields (85%). Compound 3-G1 was readily lithiated using butyllithium and reacted with trimethyltin chloride to give the stannyl compound 4 for the following Stille coupling. An excess of the stannyl compound was used to ensure completion of the coupling reaction with 2,3-dibromothiophene to yield 5-G2. Derivative 6 was prepared as 2 or 4 from 5-G2.
For dendrimer synthesis, assembly of dendrons to a core is widely used in order to form functional dendrimers or to simply enlarge the π-conjugated system of the compound. For the preparation of the donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) type compounds, we decided to start from a fluorenone-based compound 7, namely 2,7-bis(4-octyl-5,2’-bithien-2-yl)-fluoren-9-one. This molecule can be prepared in gram-scale according to the procedure described in our previous report.14 Treating 7 with N-bromosuccinimide or N-iodosuccinimide gave the corresponding dibromo or diiodo derivatives (8 and 9, Scheme 2) in good yields (63% and 74% respectively). Compounds FG0 (reference compound), FG1 and FG2 were then obtained by coupling the dihalogeno derivative 8 or 9 with compounds 2, 4 and 6, according to the Stille cross-coupling conditions (Scheme 2). The use of the iodine derivative is highly recommended for the preparation of the dendrimers since it was found that the coupling reaction carried out with the dibromo derivative gives FG0 in significantly lower yields (50% vs. 89%). The fluorenone core-based D–A–D dendrimers were obtained in quite good yields varying from 75% for the smaller one, FG1, to 48% for the larger one, FG2. It should be noted that the presence of multiple n-octyl chains in the final molecules advantageously ensures their high solubility (up to ca. 80 g L−1) in common organic solvents,2 used for the fabrication of organic solar cells, such as chloroform, toluene, cholorobenzene, and ortho-dichlorobenzene. The structure and purity of the dendritic precursors 3-G1, 5-G2 as well as those of the corresponding fluorenone-based FG0, FG1, and FG2 D–A–D molecules were confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC).

2.2. Optical properties
The electronic and optical properties of fluorenone-containing molecules and polymers are usually very different from their fluorene analogues. This is caused by the presence of an additional chromophore (i.e. the carbonyl group) giving rise to specific spectral features characteristic of the fluorenone unit. The lowest energy transition in fluorenone possesses n–π* or a π–π* character15 with a contribution from an internal charge-transfer (ICT) which is responsible for the extension of the absorption bands within the visible part of the spectrum for this class of molecules.16 In UV-Vis spectra of compounds with a fluorenone-core linked in positions 2 and 7 to oligo(thiophene)s all spectral characteristics, discussed above, can clearly be distinguished.15,17 They all exhibit two more or less resolved absorption bands. The more intense peak is located at the limit between the UV and the visible parts of the spectrum (i.e.λ < 430 nm in solution) and corresponds to the π–π* transition of the π-conjugated aromatic rings. The longer wavelength band (i.e. the band located in the visible part of the spectrum) can be ascribed to an ICT that occurs between the electron rich oligo(thiophene) segments and the central fluorenone unit. The UV-Vis spectra of FG0, FG1 and FG2 recorded in chloroform solutions and the solid-state spectra obtained for thin solid films are shown in Fig. 1a and 1b, respectively. With increasing number of thiophene units in the peripheral segments, the position of the maximum absorption peak is bathochromically shifted from 410 nm (FG0), to 420 nm (FG1) and, to 423 nm (FG2) in chloroform solutions; simultaneously the molecular coefficients of absorption for the λmax transition increase. This behaviour is expected since the molar absorption coefficient is known to be dependent upon the number of the thiophene units in linear but also branched oligo(thiophene)s.18 A broadening of the spectrum is also observed, postulated to originate from the merging of the bathochromically-shifted π–π* absorption band and the ICT one rather than from intermolecular interactions occurring sometimes in highly concentrated solutions.19 In addition, the higher spectral weight at shorter wavelength in FG2 is due to the distribution of π-conjugation lengths in the dendritic structure as observed in other thiophene-based dendrimers.20 In spectra of thin films spin-cast on a glass substrate, an even more pronounced bathochromic shift is observed with increasing number of peripheral thiophene rings. The peaks are broader and this broadening can be attributed to intermolecular interactions in the solid state, i.e. π–π stacking of the π-conjugated backbones.21 The steric hindrance of the oligo(thiophene) dendrons in FG2 leads to reduced intermolecular interactions. This may explain the lower absorption edge (700 nm) for this molecule in the solid-state when compared to that measured for FG1 (725 nm). The optical band gap was calculated for each compound from the absorption edge of their thin film spectrum. The determined optical band gap values (lying between ca. 1.71 and 1.77 eV) were lower that those of the corresponding fluorenone and thiophene-based homo(oligomer)s or homo(polymer)s,22 indicating a band gap narrowing phenomenon induced by donor–acceptor interactions.

2.3. Electrochemical properties

Cyclic voltammetry or differential pulse voltammetry are important techniques for the investigations of π-conjugated molecules and macromolecules since, in properly executed experiments, the positions of their HOMO and LUMO levels can be estimated and, by consequence, the width of the so-called “electrochemical gap” can be calculated.

Fig. 2 depicts the cyclic voltammograms of FG0, FG1 and FG2. The first reduction and first oxidation potentials are listed in Table 1. From these data, the positions of the HOMO and LUMO levels were estimated according to a published procedure.23 The electrochemical band-gap values were calculated as the difference between the positions of the LUMO and HOMO levels. They are in a rather good agreement with the optical band gaps. One should also note that the measured band gaps are lower than those measured for thiophene or fluorenone homo(oligomer)s or homo(polymer)s23 which, again, can be considered as a manifestation of intramolecular D–A interactions.

Cylic voltammogram of FG0 shows one anodic peak, corresponding to the oxidation of the oligo(thiophene) moiety, which has its reduction counterpart in the reverse scan. The electron withdrawing character of the fluorenone core causes a significant shift of this oxidation peak towards higher potentials. With increasing size of the end-capping dendrons, the oxidation process becomes multi-step and starts at lower potentials (see voltammograms of FG1 and FG2). It may be postulated that peripheral thiophene rings are better screened from the electron withdrawing effect of the fluorenone core and start to oxidize first.
The two-steps and three-steps oxidation processes of FG1 and FG2 are consistent with two types of thiophene rings in the former molecule, and with three different types in the latter one. The reduction process of fluorenone-containing π-conjugated molecules or macromolecules occurs via transforming of the carbonyl group to a radical anion.24
In FG0, FG1, and FG2 this reduction is strongly influenced by electron-donating properties of the oligo(thiophene) substituents and occurs at potentials lowered by ca. 200 mV when compared to values observed for fluorenone-based homooligomers and homopolymers.23 Within the studied series, the electron donating effect is slightly more pronounced in the case of dendrons of generations 1 and 2.
To summarize, increasing the number of thiophene rings has a stronger effect on the oxidation process onset and a weaker effect on the reduction process. As a result the electrochemical band gap decreases with increasing dendron generation.
Taking into account that FG0, FG1, and FG2 are potential candidates for the application in BHJ organic solar cells, it is instructive to compare their HOMO and LUMO levels with those of [70]PCBM and [60]PCBM. The positions of the LUMO levels of [70]PCBM and [60]PCBM were determined from the first reduction peak, using the above described procedure and they were found at −3.8 and −3.9 eV respectively, which is in good agreement with the values reported by other groups.25
The LUMO energy levels of the FGX (X= 0, 1, and 2) compounds are approximately located at −3.0 eV, which is ca. 0.8 to 0.9 eV above the LUMO energy levels of the PCBM-type acceptors. This relative positioning of the frontier orbitals is particularly favorable for the photo-induced electron transfer process.26
The HOMO levels, comprised between −5.13 and −4.90 eV, are in a good range to ensure a correct Voc in photovoltaic devices employing [60]PCBM or [70]PCBM as the electron acceptor components.
2.4. Liquid crystalline properties
Prior to investigating the applicability of our new materials for uses in BHJ organic solar cells, we investigated their condensed state phase structures and thermal transitions. The thermal behaviour of FG0, FG1, and FG2 compounds was investigated using DSC, POM, and SAXD. DSC traces of compounds FG0 and FG2 revealed sharp transitions peaks at 155 and 34 °C, respectively, provisionally attributed to crystal-to-isotropic liquid transition. On cooling, these transitions are considerably shifted (supercooling effect). The absence of mesophase for FG0 and FG2 was confirmed by POM observations and SAXD. In contrast, DSC traces of FG1 were characterized by two peaks (observed at 126 and 159 °C during heating scans), fully reversible on both heating and cooling (Fig. 4a), suggesting the formation of a low-dimensional mesophase between the solid-state and the isotropic liquid. The liquid crystalline behaviour of FG1 was evidenced by POM observations revealing non-conventional optical texture (see Fig. 3), consisting of birefringent and fluid ribbon-like domains, coalescing into uniform micrometric monodomains on slow cooling from the isotropic liquid.
 Fig. 3  Representative polarized optical microphotograph of the texture of the mesophase shown by FG1 at 140 °C and obtained by applying a slow cooling (0.5 °C min−1) from the isotropic phase. 

          X-ray patterns of FG1 recorded at 150 °C (Fig. 4b and S5†, ESI) in its mesophase exhibit a series of sharp and intense reflections in the small-angle range along with broad and diffuse wide-angle signals. These scatterings, referred to as I, II, and III (Fig. 4b), correspond to some weak short-range molecular fluctuations and evidence the liquid-like nature of the mesophase. The most intense halo II, located at ca. 4.7 Å, represents the typical correlation distance between aliphatic chains in liquid-like conformation, and is in direct line with the fluid nature of the mesophase.
 Fig. 4  a) DSC thermogram obtained during the first heating and cooling cycles at a scan rate of 5 °C min−1 for FG1, and (b) X-ray diffractograms of FG1 in its Smobl phase at 150 °C. 
The quite sharp halo I, measured at a distance of 3.7 Å is associated to close face-to-face (so-called π–π) stacking of the aromatic cores. Finally, the very weak halo III located at ca. 7.4 Å and corresponding to the doubling of the periodicity of I is tentatively interpreted as the manifestation of a pairing process resulting from loose antiparallel (alternated) π-stacking of adjacent molecules. Such interactions are possible between the fluorenone–thiophene central units due to the planar geometry of the aromatic central units as clearly observed in the view of the molecular single crystal structure of the dibrominated compound 8 (see Fig. S4† in the ESI). In the small-angle region, eight sharp Bragg reflections can be clearly observed and measured (Fig. 4, see Fig. S5† and Table S5† in the ESI). Such an X-ray pattern reflecting an apparent low symmetry is rather unusual for liquid crystalline materials. Obviously, straightforward 1D-smectic or 2D-columnar supramolecular organisations are to be excluded due to (i) the presence of numerous reflections, incompatible with the above-mentioned low-dimensional structures and (ii) the great variability of the small-angle reflections' intensity with diffraction angle, with four intense reflections (1, 2, 3, and 4, ESI†).
In contrast, this matches well with the signatures of more complex low-symmetry three-dimensional structures. Attempted indexations into the highly symmetrical 3D orthorhombic, tetragonal, hexagonal, and cubic crystal systems obviously failed (and the corresponding space groups are therefore excluded).
Indexation in a monoclinic system also failed. The only suitable solutions for the indexation were obtained by trying serendipitously various combinations in the frame of the triclinic crystalline system (P1 and P space groups). With the hypothesis that reflections 1 and 6 correspond to the lamellar stacking due to the aliphatic–aromatic alternation, the screening of all possible lattices converge with reflections 2, 3 and 4 being the fundamental hk0 reflections of the oblique 2D lattice, and reflections 5, 7 and 8 to the hkl satellites of the reflections with l ≠ 0 (i.e. in other words reflections 5, 7, and 8 are compositions of 00l and hk0 reflections). All solutions give similar parameters for the triclinic lattice, and only the most representative is given here: a = 53.6 Å; b = 26.3 Å; c = 38.7 Å, α = 102.5°; β = 98.5°; γ = 95.5° and V = 52.3 103 Å 3. The lattice, containing two elements, is filled by approximately 18 to 20 molecules assembled into bundles (with a density of 1, FG1 has an estimated volume of ca. 2780 Å 3). With 20 molecules in the lattice, each end-chain paves 35 Å 2 of the surface lattice area S (S = absinγ) and the average tilt angle of the rigid part can be estimated close to 55–60° with respect to the layer normal. The mesophase with triclinic symmetry27 may be described as an ordered 3D smectic phase with the concomitant development of both in-plane oblique symmetry and interplanar registry. The mesophase may thus be referred to as Smobl, and its structure may be compared to a crystal smectic H or K phase, but where the elementary unit does not consist of a single mesogen but of a sanidic-type bundle made of a discrete number of mesogens. At the molecular level, the mesophase would result in bundles, disposed on the nodes of a triclinic network, made of few molecules (ca. 9–10) packed face-to-face in an alternated manner (i.e. with the antiparallel arrangement of the transverse dipole moment), with their main molecular axis oriented in the same direction, but with a angle of 55–60° with respect to the c*-axis [001] (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  Proposed model of the 3D smectic phase (Smobl) for FG1 with sanidic-type bundle as mesogen units. 
The segregation of the aliphatic chains induces the periodic layering of the structure. In the ab-plane (plane perpendicular to the layer normal c*), the bundles are arranged according to an oblique lattice. The tilt and the bundle anisotropy are sources of disordering within the plane, and maybe the cause of the undetected higher order reflections hk0 of the oblique lattice.
The interlayer sliding, usually occurring in smectic phases, is frozen into an optimal lateral shift, generating the apparition of the hkl reflections of the triclinic lattice. The consequence of undetected hk0 high orders is the impossibility to describe precisely the inside of the oblique lattice, but the only information is derived from the relative low intensity of the fundamental reflection 2 with respect to 3 and 4 and implies that the weakest contrast is along the a-vector.
2.5. Photovoltaic properties
After their complete physico-chemical characterization, we pursued our preliminary study to test the applicability of these molecules for photovoltaic conversion.
To evaluate the photovoltaic performances of the newly synthesized fluorenone-based D–A–D molecules, we fabricated testing devices using the BHJ organic solar cells configuration with the following device architecture: glass–ITO/PEDOT:PSS/ FGX:PCBM/LiF/Al where molecules FGX (X = 0, 1, 2) were used as the electron donor and [60]PCBM or [70]PCBM as the electron acceptor components. More detail description of the device fabrication and characterization can be found in the experimental section. In order to improve the accuracy and reproducibility of the reported power conversion efficiencies for solar cells, it is crucial to avoid small cell areas (<0.2 cm2), since it is known that efficiencies obtained on smaller areas are size-dependent and can be strongly overestimated.28 The effective device area used in this study was 0.28 cm2 (±0.02 cm2).

FGX molecules were first blended with [60]PCBM in a 1:1 or 1:2 weight ratio and then the active layers were fabricated by casting from chlorobenzene solutions. Unfortunately we found that most of the organic solar cells fabricated from the 1:1 ratio mixtures were either in short circuit or their performances were not measurable. The performance parameters of the cells fabricated using the FGX:[60]PCBM ratio of 1:2 ratio by weight were better with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the order of ca. 0.15–0.25 % (see Table 2). Surprisingly, the cell performance could not be improved by post-annealing treatments of the complete device. To the contrary, the thermal treatment resulted in a dramatic decrease in the overall performance of the photovoltaic cells. The poor FF and the low JSC measured on operating organic cells may indicate the formation of undesirable aggregates [60]PCBM (caused by its limited solubility) during the spin-coating process. This apparently leads to a blend morphology where significant phase separation favours recombination processes.

In the next part of this study, we have therefore focused our investigations on FG1 prompted by its interesting physico-chemical and mesomorphic properties. [60]PCBM was replaced by [70]PCBM, and was reported to show higher performances.29 In addition to a better solubility in chlorobenzene solution (up to 40 mg mL−1), [70]PCBM exhibits a strong absorption band in the visible part of the spectrum that might contribute to the generation of charges and, by consequence, to an increase of the current densities delivered by the solar cells. When highly concentrated chlorobenzene solutions are used for the preparation of active layers (20 mg mL−1 of FG1), the thicknesses of films is comprised between 350 and 400 nm and the efficiency of the FG1:[70]PCBM device is strongly dependent on thermal annealing treatments. Table 2 summarizes some of the observed effects. An annealing temperature of 90 °C was found to be optimum despite the fact that it is much lower than the temperature at which the crystal-to-mesophase transition occurs (Cr. 126 °C, SmObl). Higher annealing treatments (at 120 °C or at 150 °C) resulted in less efficient solar cells. The overall effect of annealing at 90 °C was that all parameters relevant to the energy-conversion efficiency were improved. However, it should be underlined that this effect was only obtained after annealing of the complete devices. The thermal treatment resulted in an improvement of charge transport (the measured Jsc values were 5 to 15 times higher), and in an increase of the fill factor (Fig. 6).
 Fig. 6  Current density voltage (J–V) characteristics and energy diagram of a FG1:[70]PCBM blend. The grey line was measured in the dark, the dark line under illumination (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2). 
The estimated potential loss of the devices were of the order of 0.2–0.4 V, in good agreement with the majority of the literature reports, where experimental VOC values were found smaller than the theoretical upper value, i.e., LUMO([70]PCBM)-HOMO(FG1), with potential losses of ca. 0.3–0.4 V.
When chlorobenzene solutions with a lower concentration (12 mg mL−1 of FG1) were used for the preparation of the active layers, the thickness of the blended films was consequently reduced, typically around 90–120 nm, and increased efficiencies were observed. The current densities delivered by the photovoltaic cells raised up to 3.47 mA.cm−2 and the FF was slightly improved leading to a PCE value of ca. 0.8%. In this case, annealing treatments of the photovoltaic devices were detrimental to their performances leading to reduced electrical parameters, even after annealing at 90 °C.
All FG1:[70]PCBM thin films, i.e. those cast from less concentrated solutions, were very smooth and showed a nanoscale phase separation, independent of the D–A ratio in the blend (see Fig. 7).

Since the morphology of the active layer is one of the crucial parameter determining the cell performance, we have done a detailed investigation using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM).
To the contrary the AFM images of the thicker samples revealed distinct domains in both topographical and phase images, with rectangle-shaped features. From these images, it can be inferred that the aligned fibers, which can be distinguished in the rectangle-shape features, are donor-rich domains and the light spots in the phase image structures are acceptor-rich domains (see Fig. 8a–c).

The observation of this ordered network showing a distinct phase separation may provide an explanation of the lower PCEs observed for these photovoltaics devices.
Such phase separation phenomena is obviously unfavorable for the dissociation of excitons. The images of thin films annealed at 120 °C or higher temperatures clearly demonstrate that a demixing process occurs. In this case bright spots corresponding to [70]PCBM crystallites can be clearly distinguished. This observation is fully consistent with the degradation of the electrical performance observed for the photovoltaic devices annealed at temperatures above 90 °C.
Finally, we have performed Incident Photon to Current Efficiency (IPCE) experiments. The results of the IPCE experiments unequivocally confirmed the photoelectrical activity of both components of the BHJ.
The solid-state absorption spectrum of a typical FG1:[70]PCBM layer is shown in Fig. 9. It matches the IPCE curve which shows increased values in the spectral region (i.e. over 15%) where both components of the blend show high absorbance between 350 nm and 600 nm.

Interestingly, the devices can generate photocurrents of up to 750 nm. This finding unequivocally confirms active participation of the ICT absorption, resulting from the presence of the donor and acceptor segments in FG1, in the generation of the photocurrent.
3. Conclusions
In conclusion, molecular bulk-heterojunction solar cells have been fabricated using a novel family of D–A–D π-conjugated molecules consisting of a fluorenone core and oligothiophene dendrons of increasing generations. These molecular semiconductors show a perfectly well-defined chemical structure and can be solution processed. Among the newly synthesized molecules the organic semiconductor FG1 revealed a liquid crystalline behaviour corresponding to a smectic ordering with a triclinic symmetry (Smobl) upon heating. This compound was blended with [70]PCBM to fabricate solar cells. Test devices of an active area of 0.28 cm2 showed PCE values up to ca. 0.8%.

2,7-Bis(4,5″-dioctyl-[5,2′;5′,2″]-terthiophen-2-yl)-fluoren-9-one (FG0). 

            Palladium tetrakistriphenyl phosphine (Pd(PPh3)4, 22 mg, 0.019 mmol, 4% molar) was added to a DMF solution (30 mL) containing 2 (1.15 mmol, 2.4 eq.) and 9 (470 mg, 0.477 mmol, 1 eq.). The reaction mixture was stirred for 14 hours at 100 °C and then allowed to cool to room temperature. The crude mixture was extracted with chloroform, washed with 2 N HCl aqueous solution, and filtered through celite. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated under vacuum. The crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using chloroform as eluent. A second purification by column chromatography using mixtures of solvents of increasing polarity (hexane/chloroform 100/10 to 70/30 v/v) afforded the desired product FG0 as a red-purple solid (89%, 480 mg). Employing the same procedure, starting from 8, the product was obtained with a yield of 50%. 1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm): 7.82 (d, 5J = 1.5 Hz, 2H), 7.61 (dd, 3J = 7.7 Hz and 5J = 1.7 Hz, 2H), 7.41 (d, 3J = 7.8 Hz, 2H), 7.18 (s, 2H), 7.03 (d, 3J = 3.8 Hz, 2H), 7.00 (d, 3J = 3.6 Hz, 2H), 6.99 (d, 3J = 3.5 Hz, 2H), 2.79 (t, 3J = 7.6 Hz, 4H), 2.75 (t, 3J = 7.7 Hz, 4H), 1.75–1.61 (m, 3J = 7.6 Hz, 8H), 1.43–1.22 (m, 40H), 0.89 (t, 3J = 6.6 Hz, 12H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 50 MHz): δ (ppm): 193.28 (C=O), 145.62 (2C), 142.54 (2C), 140.48 (2C), 140.02 (2C), 137.76 (2C), 134.97 (2C), 134.79 (2C), 134.37 (2C), 134.14 (2C), 131.05 (2C), 130.89 (2C), 126.66 (2C), 126.24 (2C), 124.79 (2C),123.33 (2C), 123.17 (2C), 120.79 (2C), 120.68 (2C), 31.91 (2C), 31.86 (2C), 31.60 (2C), 30.46 (2C), 30.21 (2C), 29.63 (4C), 29.45 (2C), 29.34 (2C), 29.30 (2C), 29.24 (2C), 29.12 (2C), 22.70 (2C), 22.67 (2C), 14.14 (2C), 14.11 (2C).
