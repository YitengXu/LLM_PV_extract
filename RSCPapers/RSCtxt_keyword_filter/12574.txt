Among them, the first batch of FBT-DThDT-TT with relatively low molecular weight (MW) can be denoted as FBT-DThDT-TT-L and the second batch of FBT-DThDT-TT with much higher MW can be denoted as FBT-DThDT-TT-H. FBT-DThDT-1T possesses a low FET hole mobility of 2.6 × 10−3 cm2 (V s)−1 and a poor power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.91% in inverted polymer solar cells (i-PSCs) under the illumination of AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 light.

FBT-DThDT-TT shows strong interchain aggregation in a room temperature solution, its absorption spectra in a room temperature solution and in a thin film were almost identical. The field-effect transistors based on FBT-DThDT-TT-L and FBT-DThDT-TT-H show improved hole mobilities of 0.38 and 0.20 cm2 (V s)−1, respectively. The i-PSCs based on FBT-DThDT-TT-L show a better PCE of 3.47%, and the i-PSCs based on FBT-DThDT-TT-H with a higher MW exhibit the best PCE up to 7.78%, with highly improved absorption capacity and miscibility with PC71BM. Moreover, with a 355 nm thick active layer, a PCE of 6.72% with a high FF of 67.8% is still obtained for FBT-DThDT-TT-H-based devices. The impressive results make FBT-DThDT-TT a promising candidate for applications of large-scale solution-processable PSCs.
Introduction
Over the past few decades, the development of organic semiconductors has made significant progress especially in p-type materials used for bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs),1–8 whose structure is the most widely utilized for highly efficient PSCs to date.9–16 In PSCs, a p-type material is mostly a low band-gap (LBG) D–A conjugated polymer incorporating electron-donating (D) and electron-accepting (A) units on the backbone. To obtain highly efficient PSCs, it's a challenge to develop a low band-gap (LBG) D–A conjugated polymer that can simultaneously possess a strong and broad absorption spectrum to harvest more solar radiation and high hole mobility for efficient charge transport. Moreover, it's essential for solution processing PSCs that a p-type material has sufficient solubility for processability and miscibility with an n-type material.
The fluorinated D–A conjugated polymers as donors for PSCs have been intensively investigated in recent years, among which fluorinated benzothiadiazoles (BTs) as the A-units incorporating an electron-withdrawing F atom onto BT have attracted attention to a great extent because of their planar structure and high hole mobility.17–30 The fluorinated conjugated polymers possess strong inter- and intramolecular interactions.17,31 Furthermore the introduction of F to LBG D–A conjugated polymers can reduce bimolecular recombination24 and lower both the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of the conjugated polymers, which is helpful for achieving a larger open-circuit voltage (Voc).14–17,31
Polythiophenes were widely studied, among which poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is the most typical representative. The hole mobility of P3HT can be up to a level of 10−1 cm2 (V s)−1 on account of the enhanced crystallinity after thermal annealing.32 Unsubstituted thienyl or fused thienyl spacers can be used to reduce the steric hindrance induced by the large conjugated side chain and improve the planarity and optical properties, implemented by both suitable side chain distance and the improved planarity of the polymer backbone.33,34 Because of their good coplanarity, oligothiophenes and their derivatives are commonly used as D-units to construct high-hole mobility organic semiconductors, combining with various A-units, including BT,35 difluoro-BT,23,26 diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP),36,37 thienopyrroledione (TPD),38 isoindigo39 and benzobisthiadiazole (BBT)40 derivatives. Previously, we reported a LBG D–A conjugated polymer FBT-Th4(1,4) with difluorobenzothiadiazole as A-units and quarterthiophene as D-units.26 FBT-Th4(1,4) based field-effect transistors (FETs) and inverted PSCs (i-PSCs) respectively displayed a hole mobility of 1.92 cm2 (V s)−1 and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 7.64%. Moreover, PCEs of i-PSCs all reached over 6.5% with active layer thickness variation from 100 to 440 nm. The impressive results inspired us to further exploit the potential of difluoro-BT-oligothiophene polymers by simply replacing the quarterthiophene of FBT-Th4(1,4) with other oligothiophene units.
Generally, a conjugated polymer with high mobility is beneficial for fabricating high performance FETs and PSCs. Besides, extending π-conjugation of the conjugated polymer is an effective strategy to develop high-efficiency polymers.20,34,41–43 Compared with thiophene, thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) can simultaneously extend the effective conjugation length of a polymer and improve its coplanarity, which was also helpful for improving the charge mobility of the polymer.20,44 Herein, we respectively use terthiophene and 2,5-di(thiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene with solubilizing alkyl chains attached on the two end thienyl groups as D-units, and difluorinated benzothiadiazole (FBT) as A-units, to construct two LBG D–A conjugated polymers FBT-DThDT-1T and FBT-DThDT-TT (Scheme 1). Compared with FBT-DThDT-1T, FBT-DThDT-TT with extended π-conjugation bears a TT replacing the middle thiophene of terthiophene on the backbone, which would increase the coplanarity of the polymer and thus facilitate both intermolecular packing and charge transport. As a result, FBT-DThDT-TT exhibits a remarkable device performance with a hole mobility of 0.38 cm2 (V s)−1 demonstrated in FETs and a PCE up to 7.78% is achieved from i-PSCs compared to 2.6 × 10−3 cm2 (V s)−1 and 0.92% for FBT-DThDT-1T, respectively.

The vial was then heated at 110 °C for 1 min and then at 160 °C for 40 min in a microwave reactor. After cooling, the mixture was dissolved in 50 mL of ethyl acetate and washed with water several times.

Compound 1 (0.858 g, 0.85 mmol) was dissolved in chloroform (20 mL) and glacial acetic acid (20 mL) and the solution was cooled with an ice bath. N-bromosuccinimide (332 mg, 1.87 mmol) was added portionwise over 20 min, following which the mixture was stirred for 8 hours in a dark place, allowing it to warm to room temperature. After that 50 mL of dichloromethane was added and the mixture was washed with water, 5% sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and brine, then dried over anhydrous MgSO4. After the removal of volatiles, the residual solid was recrystallized from ethanol to afford 0.892 g of an orange solid in 90% yield. 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm): 7.89 (s, 2H), 2.56 (d, J = 7.0 Hz, 4H), 1.73 (s, 2H), 1.35–1.20 (m, 80H), 0.87 (t, J = 12 Hz, 12H). 13C NMR (75 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm): 151.50, 151.23, 148.45, 148.39, 148.04, 147.77, 141.76, 132.41, 132.34, 132.29, 131.03, 115.17, 115.12, 115.07, 111.06, 111.00, 110.95, 110.89, 38.54, 34.15, 33.41, 31.94, 30.02, 29.72, 29.68, 29.37, 26.57, 22.69, 14.10.

After that, anhydrous p-xylene (6 mL) was added and the solution was then heated at 135 °C for 72 hours using an oil bath. At the end of polymerization, tributyl(thiophen-2-yl)stannane (50 mg) was added as a monofunctional end-capping reagent to remove bromine end groups, and bromobenzene (100 mg) was added as a monofunctional end-capping reagent to remove the trimethylstannum end group. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was then poured into 100 mL of vigorously stirred methanol. The polymer was filtered and subjected to Soxhlet extraction with methanol (12 h), acetone (12 h), hexanes (12 h), and chloroform (12 h). The chloroform fractions were then concentrated, precipitated into 100 mL of methanol, filtered and dried under vacuum at 50 °C for 2 days to afford FBT-DThDT-1T as a dark purple solid in a yield of 85% (185 mg).

FBT-DThDT-TT-L
          . 
The same procedure as for FBT-DThDT-1T was performed except that 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene was replaced with 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene.

FBT-DThDT-TT-H
          . 
A similar procedure as for FBT-DThDT-TT-L was used except that 5 mL anhydrous 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene was used instead of p-xylene and the reaction was performed at 150 °C for 72 hours using an oil bath. Extraction with chlorobenzene (3 h) was also carried out after extracting with chloroform (12 h).

Results and discussion
Syntheses and thermal properties
The synthetic routes of polymers FBT-DThDT-1T and FBT-DThDT-TT are shown in Scheme 1 and the experimental section. FBT-DThDT-1T and FBT-DThDT-TT-L (first batch of FBT-DThDT-TT) show good solubility at room temperature in common organic solvents, such as THF, chloroform, chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene. The molecular weight numbers of the polymers were determined using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at room temperature using a calibration curve of polystyrene standards, with THF as the eluent. The Mn values of FBT-DThDT-1T and FBT-DThDT-TT-L are 80.6 and 127.3 kg mol−1 with PDI of 1.37 and 3.27 respectively, whereas the molecular weight numbers obtained using high-temperature GPC (HT-GPC) at 150 °C with TCB as the eluent showed that FBT-DThDT-1T possessed a higher molecular weight (MW) than FBT-DThDT-TT-L as seen in Table 1, indicating that FBT-DThDT-TT-L possesses a strong aggregation ability. The MW of the polymer has a great impact on the performance of PSCs. FBT-DThDT-TT-H (second batch of FBT-DThDT-TT) was made at higher temperature in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB) with a much higher boiling point, and thus achieved an obviously higher MW (Mn = 78.1 kg mol−1) compared with that of FBT-DThDT-TT-L. FBT-DThDT-TT-H is soluble in hot chlorinated benzenes such as chlorobenzene (CB) and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) but insoluble in THF and chloroform.

The thermal properties of FBT-DThDT-1T and FBT-DThDT-TT-H were evaluated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S1, ESI†) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Fig. S2, ESI†). Both of them showed excellent thermal stability with no decomposition below 360 °C and 5% weight loss at 451 and 422 °C, respectively. While DSC analysis gave FBT-DThDT-1T an endothermic transition at 192 °C (ΔH = 13.42 J g−1) in the heating process and exothermic transition at 166 °C (ΔH = 13.19 J g−1) in the cooling process, those for FBT-DThDT-TT-H were much higher with 289 (ΔH = 23.46 J g−1) and 252 °C (ΔH = 18.79 J g−1) respectively, which indicated that FBT-DThDT-TT is more rigid than FBT-DThDT-1T. The higher melting point of FBT-DThDT-TT suggests a more stable morphology of an active layer and a stronger intermolecular interaction.
Photophysical and electrochemical properties
Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the polymer dilute solutions in CB and films spin-coated on quartz substrates are shown in Fig. 1. Two obvious absorption bands can be observed from all the polymers, which were attributed to the localized π–π* transitions along the polymer backbone and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from a donor moiety to an acceptor moiety, respectively. FBT-DThDT-1T shows two well-resolved shoulder peaks at 390 and 578 nm in CB solution at room temperature, respectively. The FBT-DThDT-1T thin film exhibits an obvious bathochromic shift of 110 to 688 nm and an additional absorption shoulder at around 640 nm, implying better stacking in the solid state. A 0–0 vibrational peak non-existent in FBT-DThDT-1T was observed in FBT-DThDT-TT CB solution, which indicated very strong aggregation of FBT-DThDT-TT even in dilute solution due to the extent of π-conjugation. The FBT-DThDT-TT-H absorption in solution and thin film was almost identical, even though slightly bathochromic 0–0, 0–1, and 0–2 peaks at 695, 644, and 436 nm were respectively found in the FBT-DThDT-TT-H thin film, which would suggest ordered states formed in the solution and thus improve photovoltaic performance in BHJ solar cells with PC71BM.26,45 As consistent with the results in FBT-DThDT-1T and FBT-DThDT-TT, the absorption coefficient of FBT-DThDT-TT-L in solution is comparable to that of FBT-DThDT-1T but triple in the thin film, which implies better light-harvesting ability of FBT-DThDT-TT and hence this material should be good for photovoltaic applications. Moreover, increasing the MW would also lead to an increased absorptivity. The absorption coefficients of FBT-DThDT-TT-H were approximately one and a half in solution and over twofold larger in the thin film as that of FBT-DThDT-TT-L, respectively. The absorption onset in the thin film of FBT-DThDT-TT is determined to be 792 nm where the optical band gap (Eg) was calculated to be 1.57 eV, whereas that for FBT-DThDT-1T was 1.62 eV.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement was taken to obtain the frontier orbital energy levels of the polymers. The CV traces for the polymers referenced to ferrocene can be seen in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were respectively estimated from the onsets of the oxidation and reduction curves, and the results are summarized in Table 1. The HOMO levels of FBT-DThDT-1T, FBT-DThDT-TT-L and FBT-DThDT-TT-H were found to be −5.46, −5.47 and −5.45 eV, respectively. The LUMO levels were calculated to be −3.48, −3.44 and −3.49 eV for FBT-DThDT-1T, FBT-DThDT-TT-L and FBT-DThDT-TT-H, respectively.
Hole mobilities
We fabricated FET devices with a simple bottom-gate top-contact (BGTC) configuration (Fig. S4a, ESI†) to estimate the effect of the extended π-conjugated structure on the hole mobilities. Polymer thin films (50 nm) were spin-coated from o-DCB solutions onto octyltrichlorosilane (OTS) modified Si/SiO2 substrates except for FBT-DThDT-1T on a pure Si/SiO2 substrate, which couldn't form a thin film on an OTS-modified Si/SiO2 substrate via spin-coating. Then silver film (60 nm) was deposited under vacuum as the source and drain electrodes. The devices were annealed at 100 °C in air for 10 min to possibly circumvent the effects of traps from moisture and oxygen. The characterization of the unencapsulated devices was performed under an ambient environment with a relative humidity of ∼75%. The transfer curves of the devices are seen in Fig. 2 and the characteristic results are summarized in Table 2. The mobility of FBT-DThDT-1T evaluated at the saturation regime was 2.6 × 10−3 cm2 (V s)−1 with an on/off current ratio of 102 and a threshold voltage (Vth) of −16 V. The high mobility of 0.38 cm2 (V s)−1 for FBT-DThDT-TT-L was 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of FBT-DThDT-1T (Table 2), where the large improvement in hole mobility would be attributed to the extended pi-conjugation length and derived improved crystallinity. And a slightly lower hole mobility of 0.20 cm2 (V s)−1 was obtained for FBT-DThDT-TT-H. The FET hole mobility of FBT-DThDT-TT is comparable to the 10−1 cm2 (V s)−1 hole mobility for the fluorinated and non-fluorinated benzothiadiazole-oligothiophene based polymer semiconductors.23,35 We performed grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray diffraction (GIXD) measurements, where no diffraction signal was observed for FBT-DThDT-1T while the films of both FBT-DThDT-TT-L and FBT-DThDT-TT-H almost displayed comparably clear diffraction patterns (Fig. S5, ESI†), which demonstrated the improved crystallinity of the two FBT-DThDT-TT polymers. From the GIXD patterns, we can find that there is a relatively clear (010) diffraction for the FBT-DThDT-TT-H film but not for the FBT-DThDT-TT-L film, which suggests that FBT-DThDT-TT-H would tend to form more face-on packing. In FET devices, more face-on packing would not be beneficial for carrier transport, which may result in the slightly lower hole mobility of FBT-DThDT-TT-H than that of FBT-DThDT-TT-L.46

Photovoltaic performance
In consideration of inverted PSCs (i-PSCs) as an efficient way to demonstrate high performance solar cells, we used the polymers to fabricate i-PSCs in a device configuration (Fig. S4b, ESI†) of ITO/PFN (5 nm)/active layer (polymer:PC71BM) (100 nm)/MoO3 (10 nm)/Al (100 nm), where an alcohol-soluble polymer PFN was the electron selection buffer layer on an ITO cathode. A polymer/PC71BM o-DCB solution was spin-coated onto the PFN spin-coated ITO glass, followed by vacuum evaporation of MoO3/Al as the anode. The polymer:PC71BM ratio was carefully optimized, and the best performing devices were obtained from a 1:1.5 polymer:PC71BM weight ratio. The photovoltaic performances of the devices under illumination of AM1.5G simulated solar light at 100 mW cm−2 are summarized in Table 3. Among the polymers, while FBT-DThDT-1T demonstrated a poor PCE of 0.92% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.81 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 2.2 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 51.7%, FBT-DThDT-TT-L showed a higher PCE of 3.47% with higher Jsc = 7.0 mA cm−2 and FF = 61.3%. The higher Jsc is attributed to the improved hole mobility and the stronger absorption while the enhanced FF is due to the benefit of increased hole mobility. As compared to FBT-DThDT-TT-L, FBT-DThDT-TT-H showed a significantly higher Jsc of 13.3 mA cm−2 and larger FF of 69.0%, which could be attributed to the higher MW and larger absorption coefficients, despite a little sacrifice of Voc (∼0.01 V) due to the slightly higher-lying HOMO. So FBT-DThDT-TT-H exhibited an obviously better PCE of 7.34%. The J–V curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of i-PSCs based on the different polymer/PC71BM active layers are displayed in Fig. 3. Apparently, the FBT-DThDT-TT-L-based i-PSCs exhibited a larger EQE than that of FBT-DThDT-1T, and the FBT-DThDT-TT-H-based devices showed the largest EQE, which coincides with the absorption of the polymers.

To further understand the different efficiency of the three polymer donors, tapping-mode atomic force microscope (AFM) was utilized to study the morphology of the active layer surface. AFM topographic images of the blend film are shown in Fig. 4. The blend film based on FBT-DThDT-1T:PC71BM presented an individual cell-like dispersion, quite different from those of the other two polymer blends. The clear phase separation with a large domain size and a high surface roughness of 10.49 nm is detrimental to exciton transportation and dissociation at the interface of polymer and PC71BM, resulting in a low Jsc. FBT-DThDT-TT-L:PC71BM and FBT-DThDT-TT-H:PC71BM blends respectively demonstrated low roughness of 4.93 and 2.06 nm. With a smoother morphology and higher MW, devices based on FBT-DThDT-TT-H:PC71BM resulted in increased Jsc and FF compared to that of FBT-DThDT-TT-L:PC71BM film. Obviously, the appropriate morphology of the blend films is consistent with the highly efficient PSCs based on FBT-DThDT-TT-H.

In addition, FBT-DThDT-TT-H based i-PSCs were further optimized via thickness modulation of the active layer cast from hot o-DCB solutions (∼80 °C) containing 5% chloronaphthalene (CN) as the additive. According to the references47,48 and previous exploration experiments, we chose CN as an additive because CN has a higher boiling point than o-DCB solvent and good solubility for FBT-DThDT-TT-H:PC71BM blends, which would be beneficial for morphology optimization. Devices were fabricated and tested under the same conditions as above mentioned unless otherwise indicated. The photovoltaic performances of the devices are summarized in Table 4. The J–V curves and EQE spectra are displayed in Fig. 5. The devices with different active layer thicknesses all demonstrated high PCE over 6.50% and almost identical Voc of 0.79 or 0.78 V. At 100 nm thickness, the best FF of 69.6% and a medium Jsc of 13.7 mA cm−2 was achieved, giving a PCE of 7.53%. The 200 nm thick film-based devices exhibited a high Jsc of 14.3 mA cm−2 with a broad and high EQE over 55% in the wavelength range of 410–710 nm (see Fig. 5b). Together with Voc of 0.79 V and FF of 68.9%, a further improved PCE of 7.78% was achieved. Even with a thicker active layer of 355 nm, the FF could reach 67.8%, implying efficient charge transport for both electron and holes and limited bimolecular recombination. With Voc of 0.78 V and Jsc of 12.7 mA cm−2, the PCE could still reach 6.72%. Beyond all the questions, high efficiency PSCs that stand against large thickness variations of the active layer should be more competitive in roll-to-roll printing for large-scale fabrication of PSCs.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we respectively use terthiophene and 2,5-di(thiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene with solubilizing alkyl chains attached on the two end thienyl groups as D-units, and difluorinated benzothiadiazole (FBT) as A-units, to construct two LBG D–A conjugated polymers FBT-DThDT-1T and FBT-DThDT-TT, among which the first batch of FBT-DThDT-TT with relatively low molecular weight (MW) can be denoted as FBT-DThDT-TT-L and the second batch of FBT-DThDT-TT with much higher MW can be denoted as FBT-DThDT-TT-H. It has been demonstrated that FBT-DThDT-1T has a low hole mobility of 2.6 × 10−3 cm2 (V s)−1 and a poor PCE of 0.91%. With an electron-donating thieno[3,2-b]thiophene unit, which can simultaneously extend the effective conjugation length of a polymer and improve its coplanarity, FBT-DThDT-TT shows very strong interchain aggregation in solution at room temperature, whose absorption spectrum in solution at room temperature and a thin solid state was almost identical. The FETs based on FBT-DThDT-TT-L and FBT-DThDT-TT-H show improved hole mobility of 0.38 and 0.20 cm2 (V s)−1, respectively. Moreover, with highly improved absorption capacity and miscibility of FBT-DThDT-TT and PC71BM, FBT-DThDT-TT-H-based i-PSCs display superior PCEs up to 7.78%. At a 355 nm thick active layer, the FBT-DThDT-TT-H-based i-PSCs still give PCEs of 6.72% with a high fill factor of 67.8%. The impressive results make FBT-DThDT-TT a promising candidate for application of large-scale fabrication of PSCs via solution printing technology.
