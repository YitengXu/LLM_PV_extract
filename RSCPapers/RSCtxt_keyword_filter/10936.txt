1. Introduction
At present, with the increasing depletion of the earth's resources and the excessive consumption of the environment, green, eco-friendly, energy-saving and low-carbon materials have become the focus of research.1,2 In the past few years, new functional devices such as solar cells, lithium-ion batteries, electrochemical capacitors and smart windows have been developed in this situation for energy conversion, storage and conservation.1,2 Capacitors and rechargeable batteries are two popular energy storage devices.2,3 Among them, rechargeable batteries have attracted considerable interest in smart grids, portable electronic products, electric vehicles, military and aerospace applications due to their high energy density, long lifetime and small size.1,3–5 In the large family of capacitors, there are two main types, namely, supercapacitors and pseudocapacitors.6 Supercapacitors have become one of the promising energy storage devices due to their advantages of high power density, good cycle stability, and rapid charge/discharge.6,7 Pseudocapacitance is usually related to the reversible Faraday reaction on the electrode surface through the stored charge. Compared with an electrochemical double-layer capacitor (EDLC) that is charged/discharged by ion adsorption/desorption, a pseudocapacitor can provide a higher capacitance.8,9
Chromism is the reversible change in the color of a substance, caused by various external stimuli that change the electron density of the substance. Electrochromism can be defined as the ability of a material to change its optical properties within the whole electromagnetic spectrum due to the charge insertion/extraction or chemical oxidation–reduction process when an external voltage is applied.10 The concept of “electrochromism” was first proposed by Platt in 1961.11 In 1969, Deb first discovered that the amorphous WO3 film has electrochromic properties and proposed the “oxygen vacancy color center” mechanism.12 Since then, the curtain of electrochromic research has been opened. Subsequently, in the 1970s, a large number of reports were put forward on the electrochromic mechanism and inorganic electrochromic materials.13–15 Recently, electrochromism has shown the promising prospect of applications including smart windows for energy-efficient buildings, information displays, smart thermal control coatings, electronic paper, and electrochromic e-skins.16–18 Smart windows are one of the important applications of electrochromism. When an electrical field is applied, these windows can dynamically control the solar heat and lighting input of the building to actively respond to the changes in internal temperature and lighting conditions. Electrochromic technology is a promising energy-saving applied science that is gradually attracting great interest from academia and industry.
Electrochromic (EC) materials are generally divided into inorganic materials, organic materials, and inorganic–organic hybrid materials. Most inorganic EC materials are transition metal oxides (TMOs) and their derivatives. The most widely studied ones include oxides of iridium, tungsten, nickel, cobalt, manganese, rhodium, osmium, ruthenium, titanium and molybdenum.19–21 The transition metal ions are generally colored, and the energy difference between the ground state and the excited state is small. Under certain conditions, the valence state reversibly changes to form a mixed-valence state. With changes in the ion valence and concentration, the color will also change accordingly, which is the reason that the transition metal oxides can display electrochromic properties. Devices based on inorganic electrochromic films generally require a high electrical power input to achieve the desired optical contrast because of the low efficiency of inorganic oxide coloration.10,16 In recent years, organic polymers such as polythiophene, polypyrrole, polyaniline, and coordination metallopolymers have also been extensively studied in the field of electrochromism.22–27 Compared with transition metal oxides, organic polymeric materials have several advantages including low redox conversion potential, higher coloring efficiency, fast response speed, and flexibility.27–29 The EC principle of the conductive polymer is mainly related to its doping process, that is, the migration of ions around the polymer chain, accompanied by the gain and loss of electrons. Thus, the stability of the doping state is very critical. More recently, the usage of the synergistic properties of organic–inorganic hybrid materials has become another research focus, where some issues from both materials could be avoided.
At present, besides improving the performance of the EC devices, designing new materials with multiple functions to meet future requirements is very important and highly desirable. In particular, the integration of energy storage and electrochromic functions into one device is very attractive. Since both electrochemical energy storage and electrochromism are based on redox reactions with similar device structures, the construction of electrochromic energy storage (EES) devices is feasible.30 In recent years, many studies have demonstrated that transition metal oxides (TMOs) and organic polymers could show excellent electrochemical storage properties. These materials include V2O5, Co3O4, TiO2, WO3, polyaniline, polythiophene, and so on.31–35
Since there are few reports on multifunctional electrochromic energy storage devices,17,36–38 in this review, we mainly introduce and summarize the development of electrochromic energy storage devices in terms of principles, construction, materials, and the possibility of combination. We also describe the design and application of each material in detail, and the advantages and disadvantages of each material are briefly discussed.
2. Principles
To realize their practical applications, electrochromic energy storage devices (EESDs) must possess several features, including good redox reversibility, high optical contrast, high energy storage capacity, and cycle stability. Among all the factors, coloration efficiency (η) and contrast ratio (CR) are the key indicators for evaluating the performance of electrochromic materials.
Coloration efficiency (η, also known here as electrochromic efficiency) is used to compare the efficiency of electrochromic layers. It can be described by the following formula:  where ΔOD is the change in optical density, ΔQ is the charge transferred per unit area, and Tb and Tc are the transmittances in the bleached and colored states, respectively.37 Compared with inorganic materials, organic materials have higher coloration efficiencies because of their higher molar absorption. According to the definition, the high coloration efficiency of electrochromic materials requires strong coloration ability (ΔOD) and low charge density (ΔQ). However, for electrochromic energy storage devices, high charge density is required to achieve high energy storage, so the coloration ability and charge density should both be considered when materials are selected.
Contrast ratio (CR): optical contrast is another important parameter for quantitatively measuring the intensity of color changes in electrochromic devices. It represents the ratio of the two light intensities in the bleached state and the colored state.10 The optical contrast between the bleached state and the colored state is limited by the number of active redox sites, and nanoengineering is an effective strategy for improving electrochromic performance. The ideal optical modulation of the electrochromic material is 100%, that is, the material can be completely opaque in the colored state and completely transparent in the bleached state. However, general inorganic materials such as WO3 and MoO3 can be switched between transparent and opaque due to their inherent properties with high optical contrast ratio, while organic materials could face some difficulties in achieving such properties.
The area-specific capacity is an important index for evaluating the performance of energy storage devices, which can be calculated by the following formula through the charging and discharging method:C = It/VSwhere C is the area capacitance (F cm−2), S is the surface area of the active material (cm2), V is the potential window (V), I is the discharge current (mA), and t is the discharge time (seconds).39
Studies have shown that WO3, NiO, V2O5, polyaniline, and polymeric viologens not only have excellent electrochromic properties but are also outstanding candidate electrode materials for new generation energy storage devices.36–38 As the earliest discovered electrochromic material, the electrochromic mechanism of WO3 is still controversial. Now, the widely accepted mechanism is that the injection and extraction of electrons and cations (i.e., H+, Li+, Na+, K+) are involved in the process. When all the tungsten sites of WO3 film are in the oxidation state of WVI, it appears colorless. However, after electrochemical reduction, due to the insertion of cations and charge-compensating electrons, the WO3 thin film turns dark blue, which produces an electrochromic effect.16,17,36 The electrochromic process can be described by the following reaction:WO3 (colorless) + x(M+ + e−) ↔ MxWVI(1−x)WVxO3 (deep blue)
The electrochromic mechanisms of other similar molybdenum and vanadium oxides are as follows:MoO3 (colorless) + x (M+ + e−) ↔ MxMoVI(1−x)MoVxO3 (deep blue)V2O5 (brown yellow) + x (M+ + e−) ↔ MxVVI(1−x)VVxO5 (pale blue)
NiO is a 3d transition metal oxide with a NaCl structure, and Nickel vacancies or peroxygen can appear in the crystal lattice. Therefore, vacancies, defects, and doping often occur in nickel oxide crystals. The accepted mechanism of electrochromism as follows:NiO + OH− ↔ Ni(OOH) + e−
In the process of electrochemically studying electrochromic NiO films, the used electrolyte is usually an alkaline solution such as KOH, with OH− as the inserted/extracted ion.40
Polymeric viologens are electron-accepting organic polymers, where each viologen unit undergoes two steps of reversible one-electron reduction after applying the potential. In general, the neutral viologen compound has a lighter color because its structural specificity and electron migration within the molecule is inhibited. With the increased applied potential, the neutral state structure gradually changes to a partial oxidation state, and finally forms a stable divalent cation form, which is colorless. Due to the strong photoelectric transfer among molecules, the color of the monovalent cation is the darkest one.16 The specific electrochromic mechanism is as follows:  
3. Constituents of electrochromic devices
Electrochromic devices (ECD) are optoelectronic devices that combine a typical optical film and an electronic film, formed by applying electrochromic materials and ionic electrolytes to conductive transparent electrodes. Depending on the type of applications, ECD can be divided into two modes: transmission (smart windows and glasses) and reflectivity (displays and auto-dimming car mirrors). The ECD can be regarded as an electrochemical cell. The structure is a sandwich-type multilayer electrochemical device, in which each layer appears in the form of a thin film. The currently popular structure of ECDs has the typical five-layer configuration composed of two transparent conductive layers, an ion storage layer, an electrolyte layer, and an electrochromic layer.41 The specific structure diagram is shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  The structure of the sandwich-type electrochromic device. 
The transparent conductive layer is not only a good electronic conductor, it should also have good optical transmittance, where the transmittance in the wavelength ranges from near-ultraviolet to far-infrared and occupies more than 90%. Among them, ITO and FTO are widely used in liquid crystal displays, photocatalysis, thin-film solar cell substrates, and other fields.42–46 However, there are some disadvantages such as challenging recyclability and poor mechanical flexibility. In recent years, materials such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, and metal nanowires have received widespread attention as potential low-cost, high-performance alternatives.47–50
The electrochromic layer and ion storage layer coated on the two transparent conductive layers serve as the working electrode and counter electrode, respectively. The electrochromic layer is the core layer of the electrochromic device, whose color changes when the reaction occurs. This layer requires large light modulation, high coloration efficiency value, high contrast ratio, cycle stability, and short response time. According to the different types, they can be divided into inorganic and organic electrochromic materials; we will discuss them in detail later. The ion storage layer plays an important role in providing and storing ions and maintaining charge balance. When the electrochromic layer is implanted with ions, it supplies ions to the electrolyte layer, and when a reverse electric field is applied to cause the extraction of the ions in the electrochromic layer, it collects ions. It is a key material that affects the service life of electrochromic devices. Common substances of ion storage layers are TiO2, V2O5, CeO2, and ZnO.
The electrolyte layer, also known as the ion conductive layer, is the key to realizing the practical application of electrochromic devices. The electrolyte layer mainly provides a transmission channel for ions (mainly H+, Li+, Na+) that are necessary for the electrochromic effect. This layer should have higher ionic conductivity, lower electronic conductivity, transparency in the wavelength range of use, and high durability under sunlight.16,17,36 It mainly exists in three forms: liquid, gel, and solid.
4. The possibility of combining electrochromic devices and energy storage
In recent years, a large number of electrochromic energy storage devices, such as electrochromic supercapacitors and electrochromic batteries,1,36,51,52 have attracted the attention of scientists. The combination of optical modulation and energy storage functions can be used for online power monitoring, and also for smart window applications. Similar device structure, similar electrode materials and the same redox mechanism characteristics make it feasible to integrate electrochromic devices and energy storage devices into one system, which not only meets multi-functional applications, but it also achieves cost efficiency.
The typical structure of the electrochromic energy storage device is a sandwiched structure, which is composed of a working electrode, an electrolyte and a counter electrode. Usually, there are two types of electrochromic batteries, namely, traditional rocking chair batteries and new self-powered and rechargeable electrochromic batteries.38 The transmission-mode ECDs are transparent rocking chair batteries that require that the working electrode and counter electrode materials to have redox properties, and the working electrode materials must have electrochromic ability. However, self-powered and self-charged electrochromic batteries are composed of electrochromic film electrodes and electroactive metal foils, similar to dual-ion batteries. The electroactive material film on the counter electrode of the electrochromic supercapacitor is not necessary for displaying electrochromic performance but must have supercapacitive characteristics.
Both energy storage and electrochromic properties come from the redox mechanism. Thus, in the electrochromic supercapacitors or batteries, charge injection and extraction during the charging–discharging are consistent with the chromatic transitions at different potentials. The rapid electrochemical reaction and effective electron and ion transmission can improve the rate capability of batteries and capacitors, and also bring about rapid response to electrochromic devices. Increasing the effective surface area and shortening the diffusion path length are two effective methods for improving the charge transport in EESDs. Many studies have shown that reducing the size of the material to one-dimensional or even zero-dimensional can increase the contact area of the electrolyte, that is, shorten the ion diffusion distance, which is beneficial for accelerating the electrochemical process to some extent.2,45,53
5. Electrochromic capacitors
Since smart electronic products have been widely used in our daily lives, it is the current development trend to integrate more innovative technologies into electronic products to make them more intelligent. Compared with batteries, supercapacitors generally exhibit lower energy densities. However, they have two obvious advantages of fast charge/discharge rate and long cycle life. In recent years, some supercapacitors with self-healable, stretchable, electrochromic, shape-memorable, and self-charging functions have been reported.51,54–58 Among them, electrochromic supercapacitors have attracted much attention because they can monitor the amount of electricity according to the appearance of a color change. The materials currently used for electrochromic supercapacitors are mainly divided into three categories: inorganic, organic, and inorganic/organic hybrid materials. In the following section, these three materials will be discussed in detail. In particular, the development of organic materials as electrodes in electrochromic energy storage will be emphasized.
5.1 Electrochromic capacitors
Deb et al., successfully developed a solid-state nanocomposite electrochromic pseudocapacitor for the first time in 2005.59 The electrochemically active components in the composite material are polycrystalline NiO nanoparticles, and the amorphous Ta2O5 around it serves as a proton electrolyte. This work has opened the door to electrochromic capacitors and provided the possibility for further research on multifunctional capacitors. Since then, many works on electrochromic capacitors have been published.
In 2015, Mai et al., used a simple hydrothermal method to prepare a NiO nanoflake-based electrode grown on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass.60 The shape of the porous sheet and the strong adhesion to FTO allowed the NiO electrode to show excellent performance in energy storage devices and electrochromic devices. As a supercapacitor electrode, it exhibits high areal capacitance (74.8 mF cm−2 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1), and strong cyclic stability (5000 cycles). It also shows a large transmittance modulation of 40% and a high coloration efficiency of 63.2 cm2 C−1 at a wavelength of 632.8 nm in optical regulation. At the same time, Lee and colleagues used a simple low-cost solvothermal method to prepare uniform NiO nanoparticles.2 The uniform morphology and stable chemical bond between NiO and the substrate caused the NiO electrode to exhibit a higher capacitance of 1386 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, a larger optical modulation (63.6% at 550 nm), and high coloration efficiency of 42.8 cm2 C−1 at 550 nm. This smart supercapacitor can be used as an energy storage device, and can also monitor the energy storage levels through color changes.
High-transparency and conductivity are the requirements for electrodes with high rate capability and fast color-switching. Liu et al., successfully fabricated a trilayer stack film NiO/Ag/NiO (NAN) without ITO at room temperature by a simple electron beam deposition method.61 The experimental results showed that the average transmittance of the NAN film in the visible light region reached 70%, which is equivalent to the ITO/NiO film (average 77.4%). The NAN electrode has a square resistance of only 8.0 Ω □−1, and its high conductivity directly leads to a fast response time (τc = 4.3 s, τb = 4.0 s) in electrochromism, while also achieving large optical modulation of 24.3% at 550 nm and high coloration efficiency of 76.6 cm2 C−1. The NAN film shows excellent specific capacitance of 364 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 when used as a capacitor electrode, which is significantly higher as compared to the ITO/NiO film (76.5 F g−1). NAN also shows a high rate capability. At 0.8 mA cm−2, the specific capacitance remains at 62.2% of the initial capacitance at 0.05 mA cm−2. After 800 cycles at 0.8 mA cm−2, 89.3% of the initial value of the capacitance can be retained. This paves the way for further research on highly conductive and transparent multifunctional electrode materials.
Wang and co-workers, for the first time, developed a flexible, compact, and smart self-charging power package that integrated hybrid tribo/piezoelectric nanogenerators (NG) and electrochromic supercapacitors into one system.62 Electrochromic supercapacitors used silver nanowires/NiO (AgNWs/NiO) as the active electrode material. The specific structure of a self-charging power package is shown in Fig. 2. Electrochemical results show that the electrochromic supercapacitor has a high capacitance of 3.47 mF cm−2 (17.4 F g−1) and good cyclability (80.7% after 10000 cycles). During the charging and discharging process, due to the reversible redox reaction of Ni2+/Ni3+, the AgNWs/NiO electrode undergoes electrochromic changes between black and transparent, showing a high coloration efficiency of 51.9 cm2 C−1 at 550 nm. The integrated electrochromic supercapacitor can self-charge to 3 V within 900 s under continuous palm impact to light up a light-emitting diode (LED). During the self-charging process, the state of charge can be detected according to the color change. This provides us with deep guidance for designing self-charging power packages in the future.

Tungsten oxide (WO3) was the first inorganic substance with electrochromic properties to show excellent electrochemical performance and has also been extensively studied in the field of capacitors. Mai and colleagues prepared a high-performance ultra-thin WO3 film through a simple thermal evaporation method.51 The electrochromic pseudocapacitor with WO3 film (obtained by evaporating WO3 powder on fluorine-doped tin oxide) as an electrode, and sulfuric acid as the electrolyte, showed excellent electrochemical properties, including a high specific capacitance of 639.8 F g−1, and rapid response time (τc = 3.1 s, τb = 0.9 s). When a voltage of 0.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) was applied, the color of the WO3 film changed from transparent to dark blue, and the optical transmittance suddenly decreased from 91.3% to 15.1% at 633 nm. More importantly, the WO3-based glass window (15 × 15 cm2) with a large pseudocapacitor was successfully manufactured. The specific preparation process and working principle are shown in Fig. 3. This provides the possibility of combining smart electrochromic windows with portable electronic devices.

Efficient electron and ion transport can improve the rate capability of the capacitor, and also realize the rapid response of electrochromism. A fast electrochemical reaction is an effective method for improving the performance of electrochromic capacitors. In 2014, Geng et al., used zero-dimensional tungsten oxide quantum dots (QDs) as electrode materials to achieve rapid electrochemistry.45 First, aliphatic amines were fixed on the surface of tungsten oxide QDs to reduce anisotropic growth, and then the exchange of amine ligand with conductive molecules improved the conductivity of quantum dots (Fig. 4). In the process of charging and discharging QDs materials, the shape of the CV profile is not significantly deformed, and the fine structure can be maintained well, even at a scan rate of up to 500 mV s −1; QDs continue to provide high capacitance even at very high speeds (75 F g−1 at 25 mA mg−1). QDs materials also show excellent coloration/bleaching response time (1 s) and coloring efficiency (154 cm2 C−1). This shows that through the quantification of size and conductive ligand packaging, the charge utilization rate is greatly improved, which provides profound options for the design of the next generation of electrochromic capacitors.

Han and colleagues successfully prepared a photosensitive electrochromic supercapacitor based on a cellulose-nanofiber/silver nanowire/reduced-graphene-oxide/WO3-composite electrode.63 The combination of the electrochromic supercapacitor and solar sensor can affect the change in the transmittance through changes in the light intensity to achieve a photosensitive color device. The system displayed a high coloration efficiency of 64.8 cm2 C−1 and maintained 75% after 10000 charge/discharge cycles. As a capacitor electrode, it has a specific capacitance of 406.0 F g−1, and after 10000 and 20000 cycles, 94.1% and 87.4% of the specific capacitance was retained, respectively.
Studies have also shown that crystalline tungsten trioxide (WO3) has greater stability than amorphous WOx; however, amorphous WOx has the advantages of fast response speed and high CE. Guo et al., prepared a bifunctional array of hexagonal/amorphous tungsten oxide core/shell nanorod arrays (called h@a-WNRAs) through a two-step process of hydrothermal treatment and spin coating, in which single-crystalline hexagonal tungsten trioxide (h-WO3) nanorods are the core, and amorphous WOx (a-WOx) is the shell.64 The h@a-WNRAs electrode material exhibits significant optical modulation (67.7%), fast electrochromic response (15 and 21 s), and high coloration efficiency (101 cm2 C−1 at 800 nm). In terms of capacitors, h@a-WNRAs show a high specific capacitance of 885.8 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, a good cycle efficiency (91.8%) and good specific capacitance retention (57.8% after 2000 cycles).
Even though tungsten oxide is widely used in electrochromic supercapacitors, it has rarely achieved an acceptable visual aesthetic effect because this material only shows 1-fold color modulation from transparency to blue. Zhao and colleagues successfully reported the first Fabry–Perot (FP) cavity electrochromic supercapacitor based solely on tungsten oxide, which can display a variety of bright colors and wonderful patterns according to its charge/discharge states.65 More importantly, when fully charged, these devices can be used as power sources for other supercapacitors in uniquely configured modes (such as “dolphins”). The wonderful color change processes and power supply modes are shown in Fig. 5. The pure tungsten oxide electrode exhibits a high coloration efficiency of 140 cm2 C−1, fast switching response (τc = 3.5 s, τb = 4.9 s) and high areal capacitance of 23.4 mF cm−2. This important discovery opens up a new path for the further design of smart energy storage devices based on tungsten oxide with considerable aesthetics.

Doping metal ions in titanium dioxide (TiO2) may introduce other states of electronic transitions, which is an important method for adjusting the optical and electrochemical properties of titanium dioxide. Wright et al., reported a new nanostructured Er-containing titanium dioxide material (Er@TiO2) with Er(III)-doped POT cage [Ti8O7(OEt)21Er] as a precursor.66 The electrochromic supercapacitor Er@TiO2 based on Li+ achieved a specific capacity of about 119 mA h g−1 at a current density of 50 mA g−1, optical contrast of 15.26%, and moderate response time (τc = 16.3 s, τb = 17.7 s). In 2012, Wei et al., reported for the first time the application of an ordered bicontinuous double-gyroid vanadium pentoxide network in electrochromic supercapacitors.8 The 11.0 nm wide struts and high specific surface-to-bulk-volume ratio (161.4 μm−1) allowed this integrator to exhibit a high specific capacitance of 155 F g−1 and show a strong electrochromic color change from green/grey to yellow. Lei and colleagues for the first time used a one-step electrochemical deposition method to prepare amorphous rGO–Co(1−x)Nix(OH)2 self-stacking nanosheet materials, in which reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and deposited mixed cobalt and nickel hydroxide occur simultaneously.67 The self-stacked rGO–Co(1−x)Nix(OH)2 nanosheets showed the areal capacitance of 112 mF cm−2 at 0.1 mA cm−2 in terms of capacitor performance, and good cycle stability (72% capacitance retention at 20 A g−1 after 7000 cycles). In terms of electrochromic properties, the material achieved a coloration efficiency of 14 cm2 C−1 and a response time of 22.1 s.
5.2 Organic materials
Metal oxides store charges on the oxide surface rather than in the bulk of the electrode materials, thus greatly reducing their effective utilization. In recent years, researchers have switched their attention to organic materials. In 2012, Wei and co-workers successfully designed and manufactured a multifunctional flexible energy storage smart window (ESS window) based on a polyaniline (PANI) nanowire array.68 The ESS window shows the areal capacitance of 0.017 F cm−2 (approximately 400 F cm−3 of volume capacitance) as energy storage at a low scan rate of 5 mV s−1 and a capacitance retention rate of 90% after 1000 cycles. As an electrochromic electrode material, the maximum light transmittance is 30% at a wavelength of 500 nm. The combination of ESS windows and solar cells can form a smart device system. When the sunlight is strong, the light energy will be converted into electrical energy to charge the ESS window.
Gu and colleagues developed a wearable piezoelectric-driven self-powered patterned electrochromic supercapacitor (ESC) based on polyaniline (PANI) electrodes.69 The ESC obtained by electrodeposition through cyclic voltammetry and constant current (CV-GS) technology exhibited an areal capability of 22.60 mF cm−2 at 0.1 mA cm−2. The specific capacitance remained at 60.34% of the initial area capacitance after 1000 cycles at a current density of 0.3 mA cm−2. Two PANI electrodes were used to form an ESC. When the applied voltage ranged from −1.0 to 1.0 V, the positive electrode of PANI exhibited a color change of “yellow-green → light green → green → blue → dark-blue”, while the negative electrode exhibited the opposite color variation. An energy-harvesting device built with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofibers, called piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs), has an open-circuit voltage of approximately 4.7 V and a short-circuit current of approximately 96 nA.
Most reported electrochromic supercapacitors are based on a planar structure, and the fiber-shaped ECS are rarely reported. In 2014, Peng et al., prepared fiber-shaped ECS by electrodepositing polyaniline (PANI) onto aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) sheets.35 The corresponding schematic diagram is shown in Fig. 6. PANI-based supercapacitors achieve a capacitance of 255.5 F g−1 (0.1890 mF cm−2) with an energy density of 12.75 W h kg−1 and a power density of 1494 W kg−1. ECS retains 93.8% of the specific capacitance after bending 1000 times, and 97.9% of specific capacitance after 100% stretching for 100 times. This fiber-shaped supercapacitor also exhibited a color change from blue to green to light yellow during the charge–discharge process. These chromatic transitions can be repeated for more than 3000 cycles. This provides profound guidance for the addition of conductive materials and the design of the ECS structure in the subsequent research processes.

Guo et al., used hydroxylated carbon nanotubes (MWCNT-OH) and conjugated polymer PBDTC-Br as raw materials to synthesize a novel solution-processable MWCNT-PBDTC through the typical Williamson reaction. Through spin coating, MWCNT-PBDTC electrodes can be fabricated.70 The specific synthesis route and device structure are shown in Fig. 7. The electrochemical results prove that MWCNT-PBDTC has reversible redox behavior on a wide potential window (4.8 V), indicating that it may have the performance of a supercapacitor. As a supercapacitor material, MWCNT-PBDTC shows a high specific capacitance of 175 F g−1, good cycle stability (95.1% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles), and excellent rate capability. The porous structure and good electrical conductivity caused the specific capacitance to decrease from 175 F g−1 to 125 F g−1 when the current density of MWCNT-PBDTC increased from 0.5 to 2.5 mA cm−2. MWCNT-PBDTC can achieve a rapid and reversible color change from dark brown to light gray in terms of electrochromic performance due to its improved conductivity (τc = 5.1 s, τb = 3.3 s).

Meng and colleagues reported a new donor–acceptor electroactive polymer called poly[4,7-bis(3,6-dihexyloxy-thio[3,2-b]thiophene-2-yl)]-benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (PBOTT-BTD).71 The alkoxy chain increases the solubility of the polymer so that the solvable PBOTT-BTD can be used to prepare electrode materials for supercapacitors by a simple method of spraying on flexible ITO/PET substrates. The PBOTT-BTD/ITO/PET electrode obtained a specific capacitance of 31 F g−1 and good cycle stability in ambient air (86% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles). The polymer film shows different colors according to the charged state; it displays a green color in the uncharged state (−0.4 V) and turns blue after charging (0.6 V). After that, the all-polymer PBOTT-BTD//PEDOT asymmetric supercapacitor was fabricated with PBOTT-BTD as the positive electrode and PEDOT as the negative electrode. PBOTT-BTD and PEDOT play a good synergistic role in asymmetric devices by providing a high operating voltage of 1.4 V, large energy density and rate performance (at 0.8 A g−1, reaching 6.3 W h kg−1, and can maintain 3.5 W h kg−1 in the case of 12.5 A g−1).
Ko et al., manufactured a semi-transparent energy storage photovoltaic device through the combination of an efficient semi-transparent photovoltaic device (ST-OPV) and a low-power-cost electrochromic supercapacitor (ECS), which can work under insufficient sunlight or indoor lighting.72 Multifunctional integrated devices include two modes of energy harvesting and power supply. When in the energy harvesting mode, the photovoltaic device can generate a photocurrent under the illumination of solar energy and artificial indoor light and store it in the ECS. Electrochemical experiments prove that the open-circuit voltage (VOC) obtained by ST Q-OPVs under sunlight condition is 0.80 V, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is 7.73%. This open-circuit voltage is greater than the threshold coloring voltage (0.30 V) of the ECS device, so the photovoltaic device can provide enough power to drive the charging (coloring) reaction of the ECS. ECS shows a suitable response time (τc = 22 s, τb = 65 s) and a coloration efficiency of 88.7 cm2 C−1 in electrochromic performance. The areal capacitance of the ST Q-OPV and ECS integrated device was evaluated to be ≈26.2 mF cm−2 at 0.04 mA cm−2 and ≈18.8 mF cm−2 at 0.2 mA cm−2. ECS can also be used as a power source to provide power for light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs.
5.3 Organic/inorganic hybrid materials
In 2012, Guo et al., prepared polyaniline (PANI)/tungsten oxide (WO3) nanocomposite films on indium tin oxide (ITO) glass slides in three steps of spin coating, annealing and electropolymerization.73 The PANI/WO3 hybrid material achieved a transmittance modulation of 35.3%, a short response time (τc = 13.6 s, τb = 9.9 s) and an areal capacitance of 0.025 F cm−2, which is equivalent to PANI, but significantly better than pure WO3. Compared with pure materials, hybrid materials show higher coloration efficiency (98.4 cm2 C−1) and good cycle stability (the charge density remains unchanged after 1000 cycles), which is because the chemical bond between the polymer and WO3 particles plays an important role.
Feng et al., successfully prepared the first stimulus-responsive micro-supercapacitors (SR-MSC) with reversible electrochromic windows.53 One-dimensional V2O5 nanoribbons and two-dimensional exfoliated graphene (EG) nanosheets were used to prepare hybrid EG/V2O5 electrode materials. Electrochromic molecules (viologens) were directly added to the electrolyte as key stimulating molecules. V2O5 nanoribbons can prevent the aggregation of EG nanosheets in the hybrid film, thereby increasing the contact area between the electrolyte and the hybrid film. The EG layer can accelerate the reaction process by improving the conductivity of the entire system so that the response time of the SR-MSC is controlled within a few seconds at the current density in the range of 0.01–0.4 mA cm−2. Surprisingly, EG/V2O5-MSC exhibited a high volume capacitance of 130.7 F cm−3 at 10 mV s−1, a high volume energy density (20 mW h cm−3 at 235 W cm−3), and excellent cycle stability (93% capacitance retention at 0.04 mA cm−2 after 6000 cycles) (Fig. 8). This provides insight into the design of the next generation of high energy density electrochromic supercapacitors.

Gogotsi and colleagues prepared a new type of electrode material for an electrochromic micro-supercapacitor based on a titanium carbide-poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) heterostructure (PEDOT/Ti3C2Tx) by an electrochemical deposition method.74 Micro-supercapacitors can switch between dark blue and colorless states at high speeds according to the state of charge (τc = 5.5 s, τb = 6.4 s). Compared with the original titanium carbide-based micro-supercapacitor, PEDOT/Ti3C2Tx exhibited five-fold areal capacitance and higher rate capacity (2.4 mF cm−2 at 10 mV s−1 and 1.4 mF cm−2 at 1000 mV s−1). Furthermore, the capacitance of PEDOT/Ti3C2Tx showed 90% retention after 10000 cycles. This provides a new idea for the further design and preparation of electrochromic energy storage devices based on the MXene heterostructure.
Kaner et al., successfully developed a high-performance supercapacitor based on the Al-ion three-electron redox mechanism.75 The electrode material of the capacitor (SWCNT/W18O49NW) was prepared from W18O49 nanowires (W18O49NWs) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). The SWCNT/W18O49NW electrode had a surface capacitance of 2 mA cm−2 and a volume capacitance of 459 F cm−3. After 5000 cycles, the capacitance of the composite electrode can still maintain 99.3% at a high scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The asymmetric electrochemical capacitor constructed with SWCNT/PANI (polyaniline) as the positive electrode and SWCNT/W18O49 as the negative electrode exhibited excellent electrochemical performance, including high energy density (14.5–19.0 mW h cm−3) and good cycling ability (retained 95.9% of the initial capacitance after 6000 cycles). Aluminum ion-based supercapacitors as a power source for electrochromic devices with poly(3-hexylthiophene) as the electrochromic layer showed a short response time (τc = 1.7 s, τb = 5.6 s). The asymmetric electrochemical capacitors showed outstanding flexibility; that is, the changes in the electrochemical performance were the same under different bending angles.
Kang et al., successfully developed a flexible hybrid transparent conductive electrode (TCE) based on Ni(OH)2 and polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE) composite material inserted into embedded Ag NWs/PEDOT: PSS electrodes.76 Among them, the Ag NWs have excellent flexibility and high conductivity, and the addition of PEIE can improve the wettability of Ag NWs and induce rapid charge transfer. Ni(OH)2 as a pseudocapacitive material can improve charge transfer and ion diffusion. The hybrid TCE exhibited outstanding electrochemical performance, such as high areal capacitance (3.3 mF cm−2), good volume capacitance (443 F cm−3), and superior cyclic stability (100% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles). The electrode also achieved a high transparency of 86%, a great coloration efficiency of 517 cm2 C−1 and a fast response time (<0.6 s). It is worth noting that the transparent TCE has excellent mechanical properties and flexibility, maintaining 90% of the capacitance with repeated bending for 8000 times at a bending radius of 1 mm (Fig. 9).

Wang et al., prepared poly(indole 6-carboxylic acid) (PICA)/TiO2 nanocomposites using TiO2 nanorod arrays as scaffolds for the first time.39 Due to the synergistic effect of PICA and TiO2 in PICA/TiO2 nanocomposites, the electrode exhibited a high specific capacitance value (23.34 mF cm−2) in electrochemical performance and also showed outstanding performance in charge and discharge stability (91% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles). PICA/TiO2 achieved an optical contrast ratio of 36% at 720 nm and a coloration efficiency of 124 cm2 C−1 in electrochromism. Moreover, the rapid response of electrochromism was realized; for example, the response time from the oxidized state to the reduced state was 1.2 s, and the response time from the reduced state to the oxidized state was 2.4 s. The asymmetric supercapacitor composed of the PICA/TiO2 nanocomposite as the positive electrode and PEDOT as the negative electrode showed an areal specific capacitance of 9.65 mF cm−2 at 0.1 mA cm−2, and good cycle stability (capacitance retention after 5000 cycles is 92%). After charging, the device can also be used as a power source to light a single LED for 108 s.
Kim et al., prepared a fully transparent stretchable electrochromic supercapacitor (TSES) with ultra-stability.77 In the TSES device, the Au/Ag core–shell nanowire embedded PDMS acts as a current collector, the PAAm hydrogel acts as an electrolyte to improve the conductivity and flexibility of the device, with WO3 nanotubes/PEDOT:PSS as the active electrode material. All-TSES patch electrodes showed excellent electrochromic and electrochemical performance (i.e., high coloration efficiency of 83.9 cm2 C−1, high specific capacitance of 471.0 F g−1, long-term stable cycling life (79.5%, 50000), outstanding power density (7.7–19.1 kW kg−1) and energy density (44.67–52.6 Wh kg−1)). The all-TSES patch device showed extremely high stability under mechanical bending-stretching deformation and atmospheric conditions. Even after exposure to the environment for 2 weeks, the transmittance and specific capacitance remained at 95.0 and 97.6%. While applying a total strain of 20%, all-TSES still showed a capacitance retention rate of 98.6% (Fig. 10). This research provides an effective strategy for the further development of stable wearable bifunctional electrode materials.

The electrochromic supercapacitor (ECSC) can intelligently change color according to the charge–discharge status. However, it is difficult to obtain an accurate state of charge by only viewing the color change with the naked eye. Mai et al., successfully solved the accuracy problem by combining a photodetector (PPD) composed of inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite and an ECSC based on polyaniline (PANI)//WO3.78 When the ECSC is charged or discharged, the PPD can simultaneously collect changes in response to current, and then continuously and accurately record the real-time charge state after the color change. The combination of the photodetector and the electrochromic supercapacitor can even detect a voltage change as small as 47.2 mV (charge change is 0.33 mC), which opens up a new path for the accurate monitoring of electrochromic capacitors.
Some research results in recent years have shown that electrochromism can not only be integrated well with capacitors but can also be developed into self-charging modes, with accurate monitoring and scalability. At present, inorganic, organic and inorganic–organic hybrid materials are widely used in electrochromic supercapacitor (ECS) devices. The electrochromic and electrochemical parameters of capacitors are listed in Table 1. Inorganic materials have higher theoretical specific capacitance and excellent cycle performance, but the color change is monotonous. Organic polymers not only show obvious advantages in electrochromism, such as a multicolored redox state, high optical modulation, high coloration efficiency and fast switching response, but they also have high conductivity and flexibility. Hybrid materials use the synergic advantages of inorganic and organic materials to improve the overall electrochemical performance and electrochromic performance of ECS.

6. Electrochromic batteries
In the past, there was a greater focus on improving the performance of batteries. However, with the advance of the intelligent era, the design and fabrication of batteries with multiple functions could provide greater potential for their practical applications. In recent years, a smart electrochromic battery that can assess the state of charge of the battery based on the color change observed by the naked eye has caused a research boom. The field is still very young and many issues need to be solved in terms of specific capacity, cycle stability, response time, and coloration efficiency. In the following section, we will discuss in detail the progress of the research on electrochromic batteries based on three types of materials (inorganic, organic, and organic/inorganic hybrid) in recent years.
6.1 Inorganic materials
In 1985, Neff introduced Prussian blue (PB) into the battery for the first time. Although PB showed a low energy density, it provided the possibility for the future development of electrochromic batteries.79 In 2003, Ho et al., combined a thin-film electrode, prepared from tungsten oxide (WO3) and indium hexacyanoferrate (InHCF), with a polymer electrolyte (SPE) containing both K+ and H+ to assemble an electrochromic battery (ECB).80 InHCF-WO3 ECB can be reversibly charged and discharged between 0.5 and 1.5 V, the theoretical voltage is about 1.24 V, and a switch between the blue-to-colorless visual response during discharge was achieved.
In 2014, Sun and colleagues made a breakthrough in self-rechargeable electrochromic batteries based on PB.1 Aluminium metal can reduce PB (blue) to Prussian white (PW, colorless), and when the connection between the aluminum electrode and the PB electrode is disconnected, the dissolved oxygen in the aqueous solution can spontaneously oxidize PW to PB associated with the appearance of the blue color. In terms of electrochromism, the maximum light modulation of the device at 670 nm is 52.2% (Fig. 11). Under the conditions of alternately connecting PB and Al electrodes for 10 s and applying an external bias of 2 V for 10 s, the PB/Al battery can achieve a fast response with the bleaching time and coloration time of 4.1 s and 4.6 s, respectively. In terms of electrochemical performance, the PB/Al battery achieved a half-cell open circuit potential of 0.4 V relative to SCE, and an initial capacity of 75 mA h g−1 at a current density of 2000 mA g−1, retaining 81% of the initial capacity after 50 cycles (61 mA h g−1). In the study of the spontaneous self-charging process of PB/Al batteries, after 12 hours of recovery in deionized water bubbled with oxygen, the recovered PB/Al batteries still provided a discharge capacity of 56.6 mA h g−1 after 3 cycles. This paves the way for the design and preparation of the next generation of self-rechargeable smart batteries.

While realizing a smart battery based on human readability, improving the performance of the multifunctional battery is also an issue that needs to be solved urgently. Zhao et al., realized a high-specific capacity electrochromic battery based on aluminum–tungsten oxides by adding a trace amount of H2O2.33 The addition of H2O2 can also greatly accelerate the charging or decoloration rate of the Al–W18O49 battery, where the charging time is only 8 seconds. The smart battery not only shows an open circuit potential of about 1.2 V, but also has a high discharge capacity of 429 mA h g−1 under H2O2 at −2 V, which is significantly higher than the discharge capacity of 115 mA h g−1 in an oxygen atmosphere (Fig. 12).

Compared to monovalent cations, multivalent cation electrolytes (such as Zn2+, Mg2+, or Al3+) can provide multiple charges during the redox reaction. Thus, they are usually considered as the best choice to increase the capacity and realize a quick switch. Recently, the Elezzabi team achieved excellent research progress in electrochromic batteries based on multivalent cation electrolytes. They prepared a rechargeable aqueous electrochromic battery using a mixed electrolyte based on Zn2+/Al3+ and a WO3 active electrode.81 The integrated battery exhibited excellent electrochemical and optical properties such as a high discharge capacitance of 185.6 mA h m−2 at 0.5 mA cm−2, outstanding optical contrast of 88%, and fast response time (τc = 3.9 s, τb = 5.1 s). The same group prepared a rechargeable aqueous electrochromic battery based on the intercalation of Zn2+ ions.82 The Ti-substituted tungsten–molybdenum oxide (Mo/Ti:WO3, MTWO) electrode materials were prepared through wet chemical doping. The doping process may introduce cation vacancies, which serve as the insertion sites to release the electrochemical activity of Zn2+ ions. The MTWO cathode has outstanding performance in optical contrast (76% at 632.8 nm), self-coloring time (14 s) and areal capacity (260 mA h m−2). Furthermore, the ZIEB prototype delivered enhanced battery and electrochromic performance, such as a high areal capacity of 150 mA h m−2, good open circuit potential (OCP) of 1.2 V and acceptable optical contrast of 62%. To overcome the shortcomings of the low ion-conductivity and short lifetime of hydrogel electrolytes, a highly conductive electrolyte based on dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-modified polyacrylamide (PAM) hydrogel was prepared.83 The dual ion Zn2+/Al3+ electrochromic battery composed of the gel electrolyte, zinc anode and WO3 cathode exhibited a specific charge capacity of 16.9 μA h cm−2 at a high current density of 200 μA cm−2 and a transparency change of 80%. Even at temperatures as low as −15 °C, the device can still achieve ion conduction and can maintain ion conduction for more than 4 weeks. Elezzabi et al., also prepared an electrochromic battery with an energy retrieval function based on the colloidal V3O7 nanoparticle cathode.84 The device showed an acceptable optical transmittance contrast of 21% at 632.8 nm, a fast self-coloring time of 6.6 s and fast switching time (τc = 10.4 s, τb = 28.6 s). More importantly, the V3O7-based electrochromic battery does not require an external voltage during the coloration process and can recover 15.2 mW h g−1 from the energy consumed in the bleaching process.
The battery device constructed by Dong et al., based on PB as a positive electrode and magnesium metal as a negative electrode not only realizes self-rechargeable energy storage function, but it can also be used as an electrochromic display for highly sensitive ROS sensing.85 The integrated device achieved an initial capacity of 21.5 mA h m−2 at a current density of 0.5 A m−2 and retained nearly 80% of its initial capacity after 20 cycles. This device can also complete self-charging within 50 s.
Lin and colleagues successfully developed an integrator consisting of a “perpetual” rechargeable battery and multicolor electrochromic windows.86 The “perpetual” battery consists of two pairs of Fe/PB and Prussian white (PW)/Pt half-cells, which are responsible for the discharging and charging processes, respectively. Pt exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and the Prussian white (PW)/Pt pair can be used to realize the self-charging process. In terms of electrochromism, PB serves as a controller for the fluorescent component of CdSe quantum dots, thereby realizing a multi-color adjustable energy storage device. The self-powered integrated device exhibited an initial discharge capacity of 23 mA h m−2, a capacity retention rate of 75% after 50 cycles, fast response (“off” 7 s, “on” 50 s), and high fluorescence contrast modulation (60–86%).
6.2 Organic materials
Viologen (RV2+), an electron-accepting organic molecule, undergoes a two-step reversible single-electron reduction under the application of voltage or direct illumination, resulting in significant color changes. He et al., synthesized a series of poly-(chalcogenoviologen) anode materials for lithium batteries with multiple, stable and reversible redox centers.87 Compared to polymers containing other heavy atoms, poly(Te-BnV) can intercalate 20 lithium ions, giving it a high reversible capacity of 684 mA h g−1 at current densities of 100 mA g−1. The structure of the polymer could also reduce the solubility of the anode material in the electrolyte; thus, the poly(Te-BnV)-based device has good stability with a capacity of 502 mA h g−1 and a coulomb efficiency of ∼100%.
The Zhang team reported a new air-stabilized triphenylamine–triazine conjugated microporous polymer (pTTPATA), which not only realized electrochromism, but also achieved energy storage.88 An important finding was that pTTPATA changed its color from yellow to red after oxidation (p-doping), where red remained unchanged even within ten hours after removing the applied potential. Electrochemical and theoretical calculations indicate that most of the oxidation of the pTTPATA polymer occurred from the oxidation reaction of the triphenylamine groups to the structural resonance of the relatively more stable free radical cation of the triazine group, which resulted in a stable red oxidation state. pTTPATA also showed a high specific capacity of 81 mA h g−1 in terms of energy storage. Zhang et al., successfully prepared a new film of polythiophene derivative (pPHBT) based on quaternary thiophenes through the electrochemical deposition using star-shaped tri(bithiophene)benzene (PHBT) monomers.89 The pPHBT film not only realized the yellow-green-blue multicolor electrochromic characteristics, it also showed a high capacity of 96.7 mA h g−1, which was significantly higher than that of the other reported p-doped conductive polymer energy storage materials. The experimental results showed that the pPHBT thin film is a good electrochromic energy storage material. This work provides deep insight into the further design and synthesis of high-performance organic polymer energy storage materials.
Huang and colleagues used polypyrrole (PPy, as the cathode), zinc (Zn, as the anode), and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) gel electrolytes for the first time to prepare flexible, electrochromic solid rechargeable batteries.90 The Zn//PPy-based rechargeable battery provides a high capacity of 123 mA h gPPy−1, and also exhibits a unique function of short circuit warning, which can turn yellow when the voltage is 0 V. Another promising discovery is that the Zn//PPy battery has excellent flexibility. It can be restored to its original shape after bending at different angles, and its capacity can be retained well in different bending states. This provides a new idea for the design of the next generation of flexible multifunctional rechargeable batteries.
6.3 Organic/inorganic hybrid materials
Water-based batteries have attracted much attention because of their safety, environmental friendliness, and high ionic conductivity.91 Therefore, designing and synthesizing electrode materials with strong adhesion under water is the key to improving the performance of electrochromic battery devices. Li et al., prepared a new waterproof adhesive NA/HPA through the co-assembly of hetero-polyacid (HPA) and amino acid 3-(2-naphthyl)-L-alanine (NA), which displays heteropolyacid redox properties and water resistance of adhesives.91c The self-powered EC battery (NA/HP2W18/ITO@Al) with NA/HPA and aluminum foil as electrodes has a discharge capacity of 8.01 mA h g−1 at −1 V for 200 s, and the discharge capacity after adding H2O2 can be restored to the original 90%. At the same time, NA/HP2W18/ITO@Al can switch color between red-brown and dark blue and restore the original color with the assistance of H2O2. This work provides new ideas for the design and synthesis of next-generation water-based batteries.
Yin et al., successfully developed a sunlight-charged electrochromic battery with W18O49/PANI hybrid film and Al as electrodes, and AlCl3 as an electrolyte.92 The W18O49/PANI hybrid film showed acceptable transmittance modulation (25.8%), moderate coloration efficiency (45.68 cm2 C−1) and high capacity (52.96 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1). The W18O49/PANI-based electrochromic battery can be self-charged in the air; however, the charging speed is very slow, and it can only be fully restored to its original state after about 24 hours. The charging rate of the battery was significantly accelerated under sunlight, and after 3 hours of irradiation, a value of 0.976 V was obtained, which is high enough to light the LED light again. After 4 hours, the potential reached 1.02 V, which was close to the original discharge value.
Li et al., prepared urchin-like WO3@PANI nanoribbons by solvothermal and electropolymerization methods.93 The WO3@PANI composite material exhibited excellent electrochromic and electrochemical properties, such as unique optical modulation (ΔT = 45%), high initial discharge specific capacity (831 mA h g−1) and outstanding cycle stability (capacity retention of 516 mA h g−1 after 1200 cycles. The average fading capacity was about 0.103 mA h g−1, and the cycle fading rate was about 0.02% per cycle) (Fig. 13). The superior performance of the hybrid material is due to the urchin-like WO3 providing a strong skeleton and a short diffusion path, ensuring fast kinetics of ion insertion/deinsertion.

Even though the first electrochromic battery was discovered in the 1980s,79 it did not become popular until recent years. The electrochromic and electrochemical parameters of electrochromic batteries are listed in Table 2. While pursuing multi-functional integration, researchers have also achieved high coloration efficiency, short response time, high specific capacity and good cycle stability from many aspects, such as shortening the diffusion path of electrode materials, introducing additional redox centers, and using multi-charge electrolytes. Multicolor electrochromism and shortening the time of self-charging have also become the research hotspot. According to the work summarized above, researchers are now paying more attention to inorganic materials, while less attention is paid to organic and hybrid materials. Based on the advantages of organic polymers such as flexibility, sustainability, structural diversity and insolubility in electrolytes, they are expected to become a candidate material for electrochromic batteries. Because inorganic and organic materials have different redox potentials, inorganic–organic hybrid materials could produce multicolor electrochromism with enhanced electrochromic and electrochemical properties due to the synergistic effects of the inherent characteristics of both materials.

7. Summary and perspectives
In this review, we have summarized the recent research progress on electrode materials in electrochromic energy storage devices. We have discussed the aspects of working principle, device construction, combining possibility and material classification in detail. The structures of organic materials discussed in this review are listed in Scheme 1. Since electrochromism and energy storage have very similar characteristics in terms of device configuration (both contain two electrodes and electrolyte) and reaction mechanism (both rely on reversible electrochemical reactions), their combination provides the possibility of visualizing energy storage. Compared with organic electrode materials, more attention has been paid to inorganic materials. However, the inherent disadvantages of inorganic materials such as insulation, brittleness, single-color change and storage charge on the oxide surface also put a limitation on their practical applications. On the contrary, conductive polymers can act as “pseudo-capacitors”, that is, energy storage involves the rapid redox reaction in the bulk of materials. Their advantages of good conductivity, low cost and flexibility also indicate that organic polymers are expected to become potential candidates for electrochromic energy storage. Although intelligent storage is implemented, the performance of the device still needs to be improved; thus, we should discuss in detail the possible ways to improve the performance.
 Scheme 1  The structures of organic materials. 
Firstly, self-charging time is an important indicator. At present, the charging method of the electrochromic energy storage device mainly adopts the following four methods: applying external power, exposing to the air, adding H2O2, and absorbing sunlight. There are some reports where the smart energy storage device is connected to a photovoltaic device or generator (hybrid friction/piezoelectric nano-generator (NG)) to achieve power supply. Due to the low conduction band energy level of metal oxides, the charge transfer from the reduced blue tungsten oxide to oxygen molecules is very slow, resulting in a long charging time when the battery needs to be spontaneously charged with oxygen. Because the conduction band energy level of the metal oxide is higher than H2O2, the oxidation reaction of the reduced blue tungsten oxide can be accelerated by adding a small amount of external H2O2, thereby reducing the charging time. At the same time, the inaccessible “deeper” active sites in tungsten oxide may be activated by H2O2, which would further improve storage capacity. Therefore, compared with the self-charging of the integrated device exposed to the air, adding trace amounts of H2O2 to the electrolyte can shorten the charging time and also provide very high capacity. However, the reaction between the metal electrode and H2O2 is inevitable, which will reduce the cycle stability of the battery. Therefore, a green, efficient and low-cost auxiliary oxidant should become a research focus for accelerating the oxidation process.
Secondly, capacity and rate performance play a key role in the practical application of the entire device. Reducing the size of the electroactive material and increasing the porosity can increase the contact area between the electrolyte and the active site to improve the utilization rate of the active site, and can also shorten the ion diffusion path and improve the reaction kinetics. Experiments show that multivalent cation electrolytes (Zn2+, Mg2+, or Al3+) can provide multiple charges in the redox reaction, which can increase the capacity and also accelerate the reaction. The introduction of additional redox centers in organic polymers can also significantly increase the capacity of energy storage devices. Since conductivity is related to reaction kinetics, adding appropriate conductive carbon materials can improve the conductivity and also enhance the rate performance.
Cyclic stability is another important parameter for evaluating the lifetime of energy storage devices. Avoiding the solubility of electrode materials in electrolytes by forming a polymer structure with a strong skeleton is an effective way to improve the stability. The synthesis of electrode materials with underwater adhesion in water-soluble batteries is another important method.
In addition to the improvement of electrochemical performance, it is also important to achieve multicolor electrochromism, high coloration efficiency, fast response time and high optical modulation. The future research goal is the ultimate high-performance multi-functional energy storage device that realizes permanent self-charging. To accomplish this, electrode materials, electrolytes and device structures all require further exploration and optimization.
