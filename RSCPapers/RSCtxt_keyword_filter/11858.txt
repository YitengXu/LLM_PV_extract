    , Accepted 21st December 2020First published on 11th January 2021AbstractReplacing the expensive Pt catalyst of counter electrodes (CEs) with a low-cost Pt-free catalyst has been regarded as one of the crucial steps for cost effectiveness of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Herein, MnWO4 as a binary mixed oxide (MnO–WO3) has been prepared with (NH4)10H2(W2O7)6·xH2O and Mn(NO3)2·4H2O via a facile hydrothermal method. DSSCs using MnWO4 CEs show power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.93%. To improve the catalytic activity of MnWO4 CEs further, three proportions of MnWO4@AC mixed oxide composite catalysts have been fabricated via simple physical mixing MnWO4 with activated carbon (AC) by ball-milling. Moreover, the DSSCs with the MnWO4@AC composites CEs generate high PCE of 6.50, 6.45 and 6.12%, respectively, from MnWO4:AC mass ratios of 1:2, 1:1 and 2:1 for the regeneration of traditional iodide/triiodide (I3−/I−) redox couples, which were superior to the pristine MnWO4, Pt- and AC-based counterpart 4.93%, 4.54% and 2.10% CEs under the same test conditions and method. The favorable performances make MnWO4@AC composites act as a new resource of electro-catalytic Pt-free materials for high-performance CEs in the encapsulation of DSSCs.
1. Introduction
Solar energy as a type of renewable energy has abundant reserve but low energy density. It can be directly stored through the photovoltaic conversion of solar cells, and then further utilized so as to realize the matching balance between supply and demand of energy in terms of time, space and intensity.1 Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are one of the new generation photovoltaic devices to improve energy efficiency and protect the environment by utilizing and storing solar energy because of its simple assembly, environmental friendliness, and strong plasticity.2 The counter electrodes (CEs) are the most important base components of DSSCs because it plays a role in the electron collector from the external circuit and catalyzes the reduction reaction of I3− + 2e− → 3I− between CEs and the electrolyte interface.3 The CEs catalysts are now often noble Pt-based materials; however, their scarcity, high cost as well as ready corroded by iodide greatly impede their extensive application as CEs materials in DSSCs.4 Replacing the expensive Pt CEs with a low-cost Pt-free catalyst of CEs is a promising route for reducing the fabrication cost of DSSCs.
To reduce the consumption of Pt is still a hotspot motivation of DSSCs with high efficiency, stability, low cost and readily available Pt-free CEs catalysts. A variety of Pt-free materials have been studied as CEs materials in DSSCs such as (1) carbon materials, including graphene,5 graphite,6,7 carbon nanotube (CNT),8 carbon black,9 fullerenes,10 activated carbon;11 (2) electrical conductive organic polymers, including poly(3,4-ethylenedioxo-thiophene) (PEDOT),12 poly(bis-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (P(bis-EDOT)),13 poly(o-methoxyaniline),14 polyaniline (PANI),15 polypyrrole (PPy),16 poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA);17 (3) transition metal compounds of TMCs, including carbides,18 nitrides,19 oxides,20 sulfides,21 phosphides,22 arsenides23 and multicomponent compound;24,25 (4) alloys, including Ni–Pt,26 Co–Se, Ni–Se,27 Pt–Pd,28 and (CoM)0.85Se, M = Ni, Ru, Fe.29 Among the abovementioned materials, the electronic structure and the catalytic property of the transition-metal oxides (TMOs) as one of TMCs are analogous to Pt group metals because of their similar d-orbital electronic density of Pt.30,31 Furthermore, the individual electrocatalytic activity of each oxide, substitution of one element in the catalyst matrix often leads to unique catalytic properties.32 The mixed TMO possesses incredible boost such as strong interaction between oxides in the interfaces to effectively separate charges and to reduce the recombination rate. Over the past few years, the mixed TMO already proposed as candidates for Pt CEs in DSSCs such as CoO2–FeO2(CoFeO4),32 NiO–Co2O3(NiCo2O4),33,34 MnO2–NiO(MnNiO3),35 MnO–WO3(MnWO4), ZnO–WO3(ZnWO4), CuO–WO3(CuWO4),36 La2O3–MoO(La2MoO4),37 La2O3–Mo2O4(La2Mo2O7),38 Er2O3–3WO3(Er2(WO4)3),39 2Bi2O3–3TiO2(Bi4Ti3O12),40 4Bi2O3–5La2O3(Bi8La10O27),41 2.5Bi2O3–0.5Fe2O3–3TiO2(Bi5FeTi3O15, BFTO),42 and some substoichiometric mixed TMOs such as La0.5Sr0.5CoO2.91,43 WO3−x.44 The mixed TMO are excellent replacements of Pt as CEs to improve efficiency and adaptability due to their useful physicochemical properties, high electrochemical durability, cost effectiveness, and environmental friendliness.
In the TMOs family, manganese oxide and tungsten oxide are used as the mixed TMOs due to these diverse in various forms. The valence state of Mn could be +2, +3, +4, +6, +7 in manganese oxides, and tungsten oxides could correspond to WO2, WO3 and some substoichiometric mixed (WO2.72–2.98).44 To date, the binary mixed MnO–WO3 (MnWO4) as a catalyst has been investigated with a wide field of applications for hydrogen evolution reaction,45 gas sensors46,47 and super capacitors,48 and exhibits a richer redox chemistry, higher electronic conductivity, and excellent electrochemical activity than those of single metal oxides. Particularly, it was recently demonstrated that the binary oxide MnWO4 could disperse on high surface area carriers to improve catalytic performance. Hereon, the activated carbon (abbreviated as AC) as carbon materials is considered as one of the most attractive carriers for the abovementioned applications because it can be conveniently synthesized with relatively high specific surface area and well-developed porosities.49 Yun et al. had embedded MnO–WO3 to the biomass-derived carbon by hydrothermal treatment and reported outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.33% in DSSCs.36 Consequently, it is meaningful to explore faster, cheaper and simpler approaches to develop high-performance CEs in DSSCs. In this work, the binary mixed oxide MnWO4 (MnO–WO3) has been prepared with (NH4)10H2(W2O7)6·xH2O and Mn(NO3)2·4H2O via a facile one-step hydrothermal method. Furthermore, three proportions of MnWO4@AC composites based on MnWO4 and AC mass ratios of 1:2, 1:1 and 2:1 were prepared, thus aiming to identify new efficient CEs based on mixed metal oxides. To enhance the value of products and to reduce production costs, AC as basic carbon materials, thus benefiting from the renewable, low-cost and eco-friendly properties, which are rich sources of carbon for future large-scale fabrication of DSSC, has become increasingly prominent.50 Thus, it is envisaged that AC aided the preparation of MnWO4@AC composites can possibly result in the improvement in the electrical conductivity and reasonable electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction. Herein, MnWO4 was further coupled with AC to apply as CEs catalyst in DSSCs that could increase the dispersion of the catalyst and reduce the resistance and can improve mechanical and thermal stability. The active sites of MnWO4@AC composites can be readily subjected to agglomeration and leach from the carbon matrix over electrochemical operation.51 The coupling action of the hybrid AC-MnWO4 composites exhibits the optimum performance by the appropriate ratio. The basic parameters of MnWO4@AC composites were characterized by XRD, SEM and nitrogen sorption analysis. The photoelectric conversion performance of MnWO4@AC composites as CEs catalyst were calculated from the photocurrent-photovoltage (J–V) curves for the encapsulated DSSCs, and the electrocatalytic property of MnWO4@AC composites CEs was investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel polarization techniques.
2. Experimental
2.1. Main materials
Ammonium paratungstate hydrate ((NH4)10H2(W2O7)6·xH2O, purity ≥99.0%, molecular weight of anhydrous basis: 3060.46), manganese nitrate (Mn(NO3)2·4H2O, purity ≥99.0%) and polyethylene glycol(2000) were purchased from by Aladdin, Shanghai.
2.2. Synthesis of MnWO4 and MnWO4@AC composites
The precursor of binary mixed oxide MnWO4 was prepared by a facile one-step hydrothermal method. Moreover, 0.3061 g (NH4)10H2(W2O7)6·xH2O) and 0.3473 g Mn(NO3)2·4H2O were, respectively, dissolved in 30 mL deionized water according to the stoichiometric ratio with stirring, and the surfactant 0.8 g polyethylene glycol(2000) was simultaneously added slowly until the solution completely dissolved for a period of time. The mixed solution was put into a reaction kettle with a polytetrafluoroethylene jacket and react for 24 h in an electric vacuum drying oven at 180 °C. After hydrothermal reaction, the mixed solution was placed in an electric vacuum drying oven to dry at 80 °C for 48 h, and the dark solid precursors were obtained. Then, the MnWO4 catalyst was obtained from the solid precursor by a high-temperature solid phase reaction at 800 °C for 3 h under a high-purity N2 atmosphere. Three proportions of MnWO4@AC composites based on pristine MnWO4 and AC with mass ratios of 1:2, 1:1 and 2:1 have been prepared by a simple physical mixing method by ball-milling for 1.5 h.
2.3. CEs prepared
To prepare the slurry of CEs, 100 mg of pristine MnWO4, AC, three proportions of MnWO4@AC composites powders were, respectively, mixed and dispersed with 5 mL isopropanol by ball-milling for 50 min in an agate mortar, the as-slurry sprayed onto FTO conductive glass with the airbrush. Then, the FTO glass electrode was annealed at 500 °C under N2 flow for 0.5 h. The thickness of each electrode was about 600 ± 10 nm. The preparation of Pt CE was prepared as follows: the isopropanol solution of 0.5% H2PtCl6·6H2O was sprayed onto the ITO glass substrate with drying at 120 °C for 1 hour. H2PtCl6 was reduced to Pt by immersion in an aqueous solution of 0.030 M L−1 NaBH4 for 3 min. Then, Pt CE was rinsed with deionized water and absolute ethanol, once again drying at 120 °C for 1 h.
2.4. Cell fabrication
DSSCs were encapsulated via the photoanode and the counter electrodes clipping the electrolyte together as a sandwich configuration using hot-melt surlyn film for electrochemical measurements. The active area of each electrode was about 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm. The 12 ± 1 μm-thick film in photoanode composed of a three-dimensional (3D) network of randomly dispersed spherical TiO2 nanoparticles sensitized with the dye of N719. The electrolyte contains 0.6 M L−1 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.07 M L−1 iodine, 0.1 M L−1 lithium iodide, 0.5 M L−1 4-tert-butyl pyridine and 0.1 M L−1 guanidinium thiocyanate in 3-methoxypropionitrile.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Materials characterization
The XRD patterns of pristine MnWO4 and AC powders at ambient temperature were obtained by a D8 Bruker X-ray diffractometer with CuKα radiation (Ni filter) operating at 40 kV, 15 mA at a scanning rate of 2°/min in Fig. 1. The broad and low intensity diffraction peak for AC is observed at around 25.8°, which corresponds to the facet reflection of (002) plane of the graphite lattice and demonstrates disordered and non-crystalline of AC.52 MnWO4 identified the intensive diffraction peaks at 15.33°, 18.49°, 23.60°, 24.60°, 29.63°, 30.27°, 31.02°, 35.94°, 37.33°, 40.30°, 40.86°, 51.16° and 52.46° from XRD patterns. These values of diffraction angle are indexed to the (010), (100), (011), (110), (−111), (111), (020), (002), (021), (120), (200), (012) and (−102) facets of the pristine MnWO4 (JCPDS no. 80-132, PDF-2 database).

The morphologies of different proportions MnWO4@AC composites, the pristine MnWO4 and AC were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) by an S-4800 instrument (Hitachi, Japan) at an acceleration voltage of 3 kV in Fig. 2. The special characteristics make the as-prepared MnWO4 without ball-milling show high apparent density and hardly any pore structure in Fig. 2(a). The SEM images show that pristine MnWO4 was actually solid block with various irregular shapes and the size of particles was in the range of 5–15 μm. AC presents irregular block of different sizes from 50 to 500 nm in Fig. 2(b). The SEM of MnWO4@AC composites by ball milling obviously revealed itself two different components parts with MnWO4 and AC in Fig. 2(c)–(e). Relatively small activated carbon particles were loaded on the surface of MnWO4. In Fig. 2, it can be obviously seen that all MnWO4@AC composites exhibit a porous structure, which has the characteristic of dual connectivity, that is, the continuity of MnWO4@AC composites particles and the interconnectivity of pore channels. The continuity of MnWO4@AC particles is preferential to the transport of electrons inside the film, while the interconnectivity of pore channels will be beneficial to the infiltration of electrolyte and the diffusion of redox couple in the electrolyte.53 With the mass ratio of AC increased, the AC fills the gap between the pristine MnWO4 granules and has a uniform distribution. The uniformity distribution porous structure of MnWO4@AC composites would be beneficial to the enhancement of effective surface area of CEs, thus offering more catalytic sites and greatly improving the catalytic activity of CEs. Also, MnWO4@AC composites have both moderate nanoparticles continuity and pore channels interconnectivity, which should be expected as the most suitable one for good DSSCs performance. Comparing CEs with different mass ratios of AC in the SEM images from Fig. 2(b)–(d), it can be found that with the increases of AC, the continuity of nanoparticles increases with a concomitant decrease of the pore channels interconnectivity. The CEs thickness of 600 ± 20 nm had been examined by cross-sectional SEM images. However, due to the same preparation of each electrode, only the MnWO4@AC composite with MnWO4:AC = 1:2 was taken, as shown in Fig. 2(f).

The specific surface area (SBET), pore volume (Vp), and average pore diameter distributions (dp) of all materials were calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method based on the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms data using 3 Flex (Micromeritics Instrument Corp., USA) in Fig. 3. According to the IUPAC classification, the isotherms of AC and three MnWO4@AC composites identified a typical IV isotherm with H4 hysteresis loops. The AC isotherm showed a large mesopore-based structure with a relative pressure of up to 1.0, indicating a broad distribution of mesopores (2nm < pore size < 50nm).54 There were very narrow hysteresis loop in the isotherms profile of the 2:1 of MnWO4@AC composites. With the increase the mass ratio of AC, the visible hysteresis loop appeared at MnWO4@AC composites with MnWO4:AC = 1:1 and 1:2. The pristine MnWO4 typical characteristics of Type-I isotherms with unapparent hysteresis loop. These results indicated that MnWO4@AC composites had a higher mesoporous portion than that of the pristine MnWO4. The porous structure of MnWO4@AC composites revealed by this test is in good agreement with the SEM (Fig. 2) investigation. Table 1 shows that the SBET of MnWO4:AC = 1:2 (1100.8 m2 g−1) and 1:1 (809.9 m2 g−1) are much greater than that of 2:1 (197.0 m2 g−1) and MnWO4 (4.8 m2 g−1). The increase in the Vp of materials applied follows the order: 1:2 (0.585 cm3 g−1) > 1:1 (0.404 cm3 g−1) > AC (0.247 cm3 g−1) > 2:1 (0.141 cm3 g−1) > MnWO4 (0.031 cm3 g−1). dp was obtained by the non-local density functional theory (NLDFT) method with an assumption of slit pore model. The dp of all three MnWO4@AC composites is about 3.0 nm. By comparing the results of three MnWO4@AC composites with the pristine MnWO4, the pristine MnWO4 presents as a block material, which has almost no pore volume, very small SBET and about 2.75 nm pore diameter. The test results indicated that with the increase the mass ratio of AC, the SBET and the Vp gradually increased, which was caused by the increase of the consumption of AC as a carrier. The hydrophilicity and semi-conductivity properties of AC particles may facilitate the ionic diffusion and charge transfer along the electrode in DSSCs.54

3.2. Application of MnWO4@AC composites and AC in DSSCs
Three different MnWO4@AC composites were served as CEs in encapsulation DSSCs that were illuminated under a solar simulator at 100 mW cm−2 of radiant power with AM 1.5 direct Air Mass filter (PEC-L01, Peccell, Yokohama, Japan). Fig. 4 presents the photocurrent-photovoltage (J–V) curves of DSSCs with three MnWO4@AC composites on the FTO conductive glass as CEs. The corresponding J–V curves of the pristine MnWO4, AC and Pt on the FTO conductive glass as CEs in DSSCs are shown in Fig. 4 for comparison. The detailed photovoltaic parameters, including the short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE), are summarized in Table 2. The Jsc of six materials followed the given decrease order: MnWO4:AC = 1:2(13.31 mA cm−2) > 1:1(13.30 mA cm−2) > 2:1(12.94 mA cm−2) > Pt (11.63 mA cm−2) > MnWO4 (11.05 mA cm−2) > AC (6.38 mA cm−2). FF values of three MnWO4@AC composites reached as almost the same as 0.68, 0.67 and 0.66, which were superior to that of pristine MnWO4(0.58), Pt(0.50) and AC(0.49) CE-based in DSSCs. It can be calculated PCE values of 6.50, 6.45 and 6.12% from J–V curves that correspond to three different MnWO4@AC CE-based with 1:2, 1:1 and 2:1 mass ratios of MnWO4:AC, respectively, which were significantly higher than that of Pt (4.54%), AC (2.10%) and MnWO4 (4.93%) CEs-based in DSSCs. Compared with MnWO4@AC composites CE-based DSSCs, the pristine MnWO4 CEs revealed a relatively weak efficiency with low values of photovoltaic parameters Jsc, FF and Voc, which was attributed to the dense and compact structure of the pristine MnWO4. When the mass ratio of MnWO4:AC increased, the SBET of MnWO4@AC composites remarkably increased while the contents of MnWO4 decreased, which significantly affected the electrochemical properties of MnWO4@AC composites CEs. The enhanced Jsc, FF values and outstanding performances of three MnWO4@AC composites result from the combination of MnWO4 with AC, which can improve the performance of MnWO4@AC composites as CEs. It is the large surface area, an amount of void spaces and porous structure of AC that not only dispersed the catalytic active moieties but also facilitated the adsorption, transfer and transport of I3−/I− couple.54 The results show that PCE of three MnWO4@AC composites CEs increase as the mass ratio of AC increases, which is caused by the increase of the number of active catalytic sites and distribution channels of MnWO4@AC composites for redox couples.55 The SBET, Vp and electrochemical properties of MnWO4@AC composites CEs could be facilely adjusted by changing the mass ratio of AC. The experimental data are matched with the results of SBET of N2 adsorption–desorption analysis.

The J–V characterizations demonstrate that MnWO4@AC composites CEs can catalyze the regeneration of the I3−/I− couple. In addition, a desirable catalyst of CEs should possess robust stability along with high catalytic activity. As shown in Fig. 5, a long-term stability test was performed 10 times in the 500 h using the MnWO4:AC = 1:2 of MnWO4@AC composites as CEs for DSSCs. The photovoltaic parameters of Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE retained 96%, 95%, 97% and 92% of their initial values, respectively. The results demonstrate that the MnWO4@AC composite (1:2) CEs were stable and coexist with the I3−/I− redox couples. The high stability of the DSSCs can be attributed to the fact that MnWO4@AC composites possess good electrical conductivity and perfect stability.55 The excellent stability of MnWO4@AC composites is one of their intrinsic merits and this makes them more suitable for low-cost and long-term-stable DSSCs.

3.3. Electrocatalytic activity of the different CEs

Fig. 6 shows the electrochemical catalytic activities of three MnWO4@AC composites, the pristine MnWO4, AC and Pt catalysts using cyclic voltammetry (CV) in the iodide electrolyte. CV curves were obtained using a two-compartment glass cell with a three-electrode configuration at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 on a CHI660E electrochemical workstation. The test was performed in 1 mM L−1 I2, 0.1 M L−1 LiClO4 and 10 mM L−1 LiI acetonitrile electrolyte solution under ambient conditions. The as-fabricated CEs acted as the working electrode, platinum sheet (0.5 × 2 cm2) acted as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) acted as the reference electrode. The electrochemical catalytic activities could be evaluated according to IP (the cathodic peak current density) and ΔEp (the peak-to-peak separation), which correspond to the oxidation–reduction peaks of the reaction I3− + 2e− → 3I− (Red-1) at a more negative potential. Generally, the larger IP and the lower ΔEp indicate a fast redox reaction on the surface of the electrode.56 The ΔEp values of the three MnWO4@AC composites CEs were 0.357, 0.359 and 0.441 V for MnWO4:AC mass ratios of 1:2, 1:1 and 2:1 were lower than that of the CEs assembled with MnWO4 (0.447 V) CEs. The IP values of MnWO4@AC composites CEs were 1.268 mA cm−2 (1:2), 1.213 mA cm−2 (1:1) and 0.988 mA cm−2 (2:1), which were higher than that of Pt (0.609 mA cm−2), MnWO4 (0.725 mA cm−2) and AC (0.243 mA cm−2) CEs. When the MnWO4:AC of mass ratios was up to 1:2, IP increased to the maximum. Furthermore, MnWO4@AC composites (1:2) CEs showed the most negative oxidation potential and the most positive reduction potential, resulting in the lowest ΔEp. As noted theoretically, ΔEp inversely varies with charge transfer rate (ks). The MnWO4@AC composite (1:2) exhibited a higher ks value than the other MnWO4@AC composite electrodes and confirmed a better reversibility and higher catalytic activity.57 MnWO4 combined with AC has provided more vacancies and defects on CEs as active sites.39 The increase of the number of active sites and distribution channels of MnWO4@AC composites as the mass ratio of AC increases.23

Fig. 7 presents the Nyquist plots and an equivalent circuit of the symmetric cells made of three MnWO4@AC composites, the pristine MnWO4, AC and Pt CEs with perturbation amplitude of 5 mV, frequency (0.01 Hz–100 kHz) and under dark condition. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) was controlled by electrochemical reaction kinetics that can take the diameter value of the real semicircles in the high-frequency region. The CEs with pristine MnWO4 and AC show the largest arc plot among the three MnWO4@AC composites CEs. Rct values followed the given increase order: MnWO4:AC = 1:2(4.87 Ω) < 1:1(7.44 Ω) < 2:1(10.16 Ω) < Pt(14.80 Ω) < MnWO4(18.17 Ω) < AC(94.0 Ω) CEs. As the mass ratio of AC to MnWO4 increased, the Rct value decreased obviously, and consequently the overall catalytic performance was improved. The improvement of CEs can be attributed to the introduction of more vacancies and defects and the ease in the charge transfer through three MnWO4@AC composites CEs to I3−/I− redox couple in the electrolyte.39,58 The Nyquist spectrum of the pristine MnWO4 combined with an appropriate amount of AC shows the lowest radius of circular plot. Furthermore, as for the mass transport process in the low frequency, all samples show a 45 degree straight line, indicating the same Warburg impedance (Zw). It can be concluded that the regeneration of the I3−/I− redox couple in the CE is controlled by the charge transfer process rather than the mass transport process.

The Tafel polarization was applied to determine the electrocatalytic activity of three MnWO4@AC composites, the pristine MnWO4, AC and Pt CEs for I3− + 2e− → 3I− reduction using symmetrical cells at 5 mV s−1 from −0.7 V to 0.7 V in Fig. 8. The exchange current density (J0) can be taken from the intercept of intersection of extrapolated straight lines in the Tafel zone of anodic and cathodic branches. A larger J0 value refers to the quicker rate of charge exchange between electrode/electrolyte interface in unit time, unit electrode area and the higher reversible degree of the electrode reaction. The J0 values exhibit the following decrease order: MnWO4:AC = 1:2 (0.451 mA cm−2) > 1:1 (0.410 mA cm−2)> 2:1 (0.296 mA cm−2) > Pt (0.164 mA cm−2) > AC (0.157 mA cm−2) > MnWO4 (0.018 mA cm−2). The Tafel polarization experimental results indicate that the MnWO4@AC composite CE possess a quicker charge exchange rate and a higher reversible degree reaction of I3−/I− between the interface of I3− and MnWO4@AC composite than that of Pt CEs in DSSCs.58 It is matched well with the EIS and CV results. The J0 value is consistent with the trend of the IP values in Fig. 6, and is inversely proportional to the Rct value in Fig. 7.
 Fig. 8  Tafel plots of symmetrical cells with different CEs-based. 
To compare the three composite materials and Pt CEs, the MnWO4@AC composites (1:2) have shown the lowest ΔEp and the maximum IP in the CV profiles, and the highest J0 value from Tafel polarization curves, which indicate a higher catalytic activity in the MnWO4@AC composites (1:2) CEs. According to the theory, Rct is inversely proportional to J0.59 The measured data of EIS experiments really show Rct of the MnWO4@AC composites (1:2) CEs is higher than that of others composites and Pt CEs. The above results are in good agreement with the highest PCE values of 6.50% from J–V measurements. MnWO4 was combined with AC, which resulted in the enhanced specific surface area, increased exchange current density and load resistance reduction at CE/electrolyte interface. The CV, EIS, Tafel, and J–V characterizations demonstrate that MnWO4@AC composites CEs can catalyze the regeneration of the I3−/I− couple as effectively as Pt.
4. Conclusions
Identifying and developing alternative Pt-free materials to substitute for Pt in the CEs of DSSCs are two of the crucial steps toward further reduction of production costs sufficiently and improve energy conversion efficiency of DSSCs. Three proportions catalysts of MnWO4@AC composites were successfully synthesized with a simple ball-milling method. The binary mixed oxide MnWO4 (MnO–WO3) combined to AC result in an increase in the specific surface area and the pore volume of MnWO4@AC materials. The results indicate that the composite MnWO4@AC (1:2) result in ∼1.4 and ∼3.1 times enhancement in PCE of DSSCs compared to the PCE obtained using Pt and AC, respectively. MnWO4@AC composites catalyst exhibited higher electrocatalytic activity and lower charge transfer resistance. Because of the facile preparation, low cost and excellent performances, MnWO4@AC composite are a prospective alternative Pt-free material as CEs for future large-scale fabrication of DSSCs.
