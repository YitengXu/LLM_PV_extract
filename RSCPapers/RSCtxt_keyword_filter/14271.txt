Zr/N-doped TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized with various Zr doping contents using the sol–gel method. The Zr/N-doped TiO2 nanoparticles had high surface areas, uniform particle sizes, and a strong red shift of their absorption into the visible region as compared with P25 nanoparticles. DSSCs fabricated with a 0.01 M Zr/N-doped TiO2 photoelectrode achieved a maximum power conversion efficiency of 12.62% with a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 26.37 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 738 mV, and fill factor (FF) of 67.3% after TiCl4 treatment. The increased energy conversion efficiency was attributed to the higher dye loading, reduced charge recombination, and enhanced charge transport.
1 Introduction
In recent years, several alternatives to silicon-based solar cells or photovoltaic cells have become available, and considerable research toward substantially reducing the cost of electricity generation is ongoing.1,2 Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been the subject of intense research in the past decades because of their low cost, highly efficient conversion of visible light into electricity, and eco-friendly production.3,4 Compared to conventional silicon devices, DSSCs hold the promise of lower fabrication costs, and they have efficiencies comparable to those of amorphous Si-based solar cells.4–6 Typically, DSSCs consist of the following main components: a sensitized photoanode, which is typically a dye-sensitized TiO2 film on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass; an electrolyte solution containing I−/I3− as a redox couple; and a counter electrode, which is usually platinized FTO conducting glass.7,8
Since Grätzel et al. reported a dye-sensitized TiO2-nanoparticle-based solar cell (DSSC) energy conversion efficiency of up to 7% in 1991, this type of solar cell has attracted much commercial interest.9–11 The recent advancements in the conversion efficiency to levels of 11.5% for laboratory cells and 10% for modules are a mark of the maturity and viability of DSSCs.11–13 However, the energy conversion efficiency of these DSSCs is still considerably lower than that of silicon-based solar cells.14 To enhance the energy conversion efficiency, TiO2 nanoparticles or nanoporous structures have been extensively studied. This is primarily due to the much higher internal surface area of the nanoporous structure compared to those of non-porous structure, which leads to sufficient dye adsorption and high light harvesting efficiency.3,7,15 However, these nanoporous structures have a low electron transfer rate due to electron recombination in the electron transport processes.3,7
In order to improve the energy conversion efficiency of DSSCs, many methods have been reported, such as chemical surface modification, compounding with other semiconductors (ZnO, ZrO2, Nb2O5, In2O3, La2O3),14 metal doping (Au, W, Zn, La, Ta),3,16,17 and nonmetal doping (N doping).9,18,19 Among these materials, the N-doped TiO2 proved to be a suitable semiconductor candidate for DSSCs. In previous works, it reported that N-doped TiO2 electrodes can enhance the energy conversion efficiency of DSSCs, narrow the band gap, and improve their absorption in the visible-light region.9,18,19 In addition, metal-doped semiconductors enhance the photocurrent and reduce the amount of electron recombination in DSSCs. Typically, Zr has filled the role of the transition metal to decrease the particle size of the TiO2 and increase the surface area, thus promoting a high dye loading rate.20–22 However, no reports on TiO2 co-doped with Zr and N have been published until now.
In this study, Zr/N-doped TiO2 nanoparticles and a DSSC including this material were successfully prepared using the sol–gel method. The photovoltaic characteristics of Zr/N-doped TiO2 with various Zr doping contents and commercial Degussa P25 photoelectrodes were investigated.
2 Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of TiO2 nanoparticles
Zr/N-doped TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized using the sol–gel method. First, 100 ml of a 0.1 M titanium tetraisopropoxide (Ti(OiPr)4, Junsei, 98%) solution in IPA (Isopropyl alcohol, iPrOH, Daejung Chemical, 99%) was vigorously stirred at 60 °C 30 min. Next, 2 g of PEG (Polyethylene glycol) dissolved in IPA solution was added. A separate solution of ZrO(NO3)2·2H2O (Chameleon Analytical Reagent, Japan) and 3.64 g of hexadecyl trimethylammonium bromide (HDTMA, Aldrich) for nitrogen doping were mixed together and vigorously stirred for 30 min. Here, the concentration of ZrO(NO3)2·2H2O was changed with Zr/(Zr + Ti) molar ratios in the range of 0.01–1 to control the level of Zr doping. Next, the two solutions were combined and stirred for 30 min until they were completely mixed. Then, the mixture was calcined for 2 h in an electric furnace (CEM.US/MAS-7000, Daihan Science) up to 500 °C in air at a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1. The N-doped TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared using a similar method for comparison with the Zr/N-doped TiO2 nanoparticles.
2.2 Fabrication of DSSC photoelectrodes
P25 TiO2 paste was prepared by mixing 6 g of P25 (Degussa), 1 ml of acetic acid, 5 ml of deionized water, and 30 ml of ethanol in a mortar. The P25 dispersions in the mortar were transferred with an excess of ethanol (100 ml) to a beaker and stirred for 30 min. Ultrasonic homogenization was then performed using an ultrasonic horn. Next, terpineol and the mixture of ethyl celluloses in ethanol were added, followed by stirring and sonication. The constituents of the dispersion were concentrated by an evaporator at 35 °C. Zr/N-doped TiO2 nanoparticle pastes were prepared using a similar method. The paste was then deposited on a clean fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass. First, the FTO glass was cleaned by sonication in acetone and ethanol for 15 min. The obtained paste was spread on the clean FTO glass using the doctor blade method, and the electrodes were then sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. In order to improve the energy conversion efficiency of the DSSCs, the electrodes were coated by dipping them into a 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution for 30 min at 70 °C until the TiCl4 was hydrolyzed. Then, the electrodes were washed with deionized water to remove the residual TiCl4 and finally sintered again at 450 °C in air for 30 min.
2.3 DSSC Assembly and fabrication
P25 and various Zr/N-doped TiO2 electrodes were immersed into a 0.4 mM solution of N719 dye in ethanol at a temperature of 80 °C for 24 h. For the counter electrode, the FTO glass was drilled by a sand blaster, washed with ethanol, and then subsequently cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with water and ethanol for 15 min. The Pt counter electrode was prepared by coating the FTO glass with a 10 mM H2PtCl6 solution in ethanol using the spin-coating method and sintering the electrode at 350 °C for 1 h. The dye-adsorbed photoelectrode and counter electrode were sealed together with a transparent Surlyn 1472 (Dupont) film cut as a frame around the P25 or Zr/N-doped TiO2 electrode. An electrolyte solution was injected through a drilled hole onto the counter electrode. Finally, the holes were sealed with hot-melt films and a cover glass. Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of DSSCs assembled with a Zr/N-doped TiO2 photoelectrode after TiCl4 treatment.

2.4 TiO2 and photovoltaic characterization
The crystal structures of the prepared Zr/N-doped TiO2 and P25 nanoparticles were determined from the X-ray diffraction patterns. An XRD system (RTP 300 RC, Rigaku) operated with Cu Kα radiation was employed to obtain XRD patterns by scanning from 2θ = 20° to 80° at a scanning speed of 8 °C min−1. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (S-4100, Sinco) with UV and visible light modes. The morphology and size were characterized by performing field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JEOL, JSM-6701F) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL, JEM-2010). The specific surface area of Zr/N-doped TiO2 and P25 nanoparticles were calculated using the Brunauer, Emmett, & Teller method (BET, Quadrasorb SI, Quantachrome, USA). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out for the DSSCs under 1.5 AM illumination at the open-circuit voltage situation using a Princeton Applied Research VersaSTAT Series potentiostat/galvanostat electrochemical interface system in the frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz. The applied bias voltage and AC amplitude were set at the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the DSSCs and 0.1 V, respectively. For the DSSC performance characterization, a Keithley 2400 source meter was employed to measure the J–V curve under illumination. An ABET Technologies SUN 2000 solar simulator with an AM 1.5 filter was used as a light source. The AM 1.5 spectrum distribution calibrated against a reference cell to accurately simulate the full-sun intensity (100 mW cm−2). The working area of the DSSCs was 0.09 cm2.
3 Results and discussion
The XRD patterns of the P25 and synthesized Zr/N-doped TiO2 with different Zr contents are shown in Fig. 2. All the XRD peaks were indexed to the standard TiO2 anatase and rutile phases.17 And the Zr peaks did not observed in the XRD analysis. It implies that Zr might be distributed homogeneously with Ti in the materials.23,24 To confirm the Zr contents in TiO2 nanoparticles, the EDS analysis was performed (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†). The EDS results show that the traces of Zr was distributed in TiO2 nanoparticles and the amount of Zr doped in TiO2 increased with increasing Zr content. In XRD results, the P25 nanoparticles showed both the anatase and rutile phases, and Zr/N-doped TiO2 nanoparticles with Zr doping contents of 0, 0.01, and 0.1 M showed only the pure anatase phase. However, the Zr/N-doped TiO2 nanoparticles with 1.0 M Zr were amorphous, with no characteristic diffraction peaks. N-doped TiO2 nanoparticles (Zr content of 0 M) showed the anatase phase, and the insertion of Zr did not cause an anatase-to-rutile phase transformation. However, the overall peak broadening of the anatase peaks exhibited with increasing Zr doping contents. The formation of Ti–O–Zr inhibits an anatase-to-rutile phase transformation.23,25 And the O (2p) band present in the valence band of TiO2 is stabilized more on Zr4+ doping because Zr4+ is more electropositive than Ti4+.23 This indicates that the addition of Zr effectively suppresses the growth of TiO2 crystals and stabilizes their structure.3,22–24,26
 Fig. 2  XRD patterns of P25 (a) and Zr/N-doped TiO2 nanoparticles with different Zr contents: 0 M (b), 0.01 M (c), 0.1 M (d), and 1 M (e). 
To compare the optical responses of the synthesized nanoparticles, their UV-vis absorption spectra were determined (see Fig. S2 in the ESI†). The absorption spectrum of the N-doped TiO2 (Zr content of 0 M) shifted to an energy region lower than that of the P25. Upon the introduction of Zr, a noticeable shift of the absorption spectra toward the visible-light region was observed. The new absorption in the visible-light range arose from a newly formed state due to the Zr that was incorporated into the lattice.7,22,26 As the Zr loading increased, the absorption in the visible-light range decreased, resulting in the band gap increase because of a decrease in the particle size of TiO2. The band gaps of P25, 0 M Zr/N-doped TiO2, 0.01 M Zr/N-doped TiO2, 0.1 M Zr/N-doped TiO2, and 1 M Zr/N-doped TiO2 are 3.1, 3.05, 2.83, 2.91, and 3.07 eV, respectively. This indicates that the Zr/N-doped TiO2 nanoparticles have a strong optical response under visible light irradiation.
TEM images of the Zr/N-doped TiO2 and P25 nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 3. Most P25 nanoparticles had sizes ranging from 20 to 50 nm, whereas the N-doped TiO2 nanoparticles had an average particle size of 30 nm. The added Zr acts as a crystal growth inhibitor, leading to smaller grain sizes when compared to those of conventionally prepared N-doped TiO2 nanoparticles. Thus, the average particle sizes of the 0.01 M, 0.1 M, and 1 M Zr/N-doped TiO2 nanoparticles were 8.5 nm, 6.5 nm, and 4 nm, respectively. The average particle size of the Zr/N-doped TiO2 nanoparticles clearly becomes smaller with increasing Zr content.
 Fig. 3  TEM images of P25 nanoparticles (a) and Zr/N-doped TiO2 nanoparticles with Zr contents of 0 M (b), 0.01 M (c), 0.1 M (d), and 1 M (e) synthesized using the sol–gel method. 
The synthesized Zr/N-doped TiO2 and P25 nanoparticles show highly aggregated structures (see Fig. S3 in the ESI†). The N-doped TiO2 nanoparticles were composed of a large number of smaller nanoparticles. The 0.1 M Zr/N-doped TiO2 nanoparticles had nonuniform aggregated shapes, but the 1 M Zr/N-doped TiO2 nanoparticles had the smallest but most highly aggregated structures, resulting in small specific surface areas and a decrease in dye adsorption.
The 0.01 M Zr/N-doped TiO2 nanoparticles showed a high surface area of 187.35 m2 g−1, which was almost three times that of the Degussa P25 nanoparticles (68.24 m2 g−1). The BET surface areas of the synthesized nanoparticles were strongly dependent on the Zr concentration. At a Zr content of 0 M, the surface area of the N-doped TiO2 nanoparticles was 54.876 m2 g−1. The surface area increased with increasing Zr content up to an optimum value of 0.01 M. However, when the Zr content exceeded this optimum value, the surface area decreased. The surface areas of 0.1 M and 1 M Zr/N-doped TiO2 nanoparticles were 153.748 m2 g−1 and 71.559 m2 g−1, respectively.
The Zr/N-doped TiO2 photoelectrode was fabricated on FTO glass using the doctor-blade technique. The obtained Zr/N-doped TiO2 paste was spread on the FTO glass, and the electrodes were sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. Fig. 4 shows SEM images of the photoelectrodes prepared from P25 nanoparticles and alloys with different Zr contents. From these images, it is evident that higher Zr contents in the paste lead to agglomerated films. As shown in the XRD result (Fig. 2), the particle size decreased with increasing Zr doping content, and an amorphous state was obtained at a Zr concentration of 1.0 M. The crystallization and crystal growth of nanocrystalline anatase TiO2 in an amorphous state may occur at temperatures above 370 °C.27 Furthermore, the agglomeration of nanoparticles would be enhanced as the amorphous portion grows and the nanoparticle size decreases in the electrode. The surface of the 0.01 M Zr/N-doped TiO2 photoelectrode was uniform, and a small particle size was detected. The cross-sectional SEM image of the 0.01 M Zr/N-doped TiO2 photoelectrode (Fig. 4f) showed a film thickness of ∼25 μm and demonstrates the uniform shapes and uniform dispersion of the spheres from bottom to top, along with the small particle size (5–10 nm). However, the 1 M Zr/N-doped TiO2 photoelectrode had nonuniform particle sizes, irregularly shaped particles, and many agglomerations on the surface. These agglomerated particles in the Zr/N-doped TiO2 (with 0.1 M and 1 M Zr) photoelectrodes may decrease the dye adsorption and the short-circuit photocurrent of a DSSC.14

The typical DSSC dye N719 was loaded onto both P25 and Zr/N-doped TiO2 film photoelectrodes. Fig. 5 shows the absorption spectra of solutions containing the dye detached from the P25 and Zr/N-doped TiO2 photoelectrodes in 10 ml of H2O with 1 mM KOH.16 This result indicates that the 0.01 M Zr/N-doped TiO2 photoelectrode shows a distinctive increase in dye adsorption compared to the other electrodes. The dye loading of the N-doped TiO2 photoelectrode is comparable to that of the P25 photoelectrode. Upon the introduction of a small amount of Zr, a sharp increase in the dye absorption was observed. As the amount of Zr loaded increased, the dye absorption decreased dramatically, because the sintering during the photoelectrode preparation induced a nonuniform particle size and irregularly shaped large clumps for high Zr contents, which reduced the surface areas of the photoelectrodes.

The cell efficiencies of the DSSCs based on only P25 and on various Zr/N-doped TiO2 photoelectrodes was examined under 1 sun AM 1.5 (the intensity of the solar simulator was 100 mW cm−2) simulated sunlight with a working area of 0.09 cm2. The photocurrent as a function of voltage for the DSSCs is shown in Fig. 6, and the corresponding photovoltaic characteristics derived from the J–V curves are listed in Table 1. The reported values of the short-circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and energy conversion efficiency (η) for these cells are the best results among three sample cells. The cell's reproducibility was giving less than 0.6% discrepancy in energy conversion efficiency.

The energy conversion efficiency of N-doped TiO2 was 5.25%, which is higher than that of commercial Degussa P25. The N doping leads to a red shift of the absorption into the visible-light region that improves the use of sunlight. The addition of 0.01 M Zr produces a remarkable increase in the short-circuit current, open-circuit voltage, and fill factor. In particular, the Jsc increases notably from 10.96 to 14.48 mA cm−2, the Voc increases from 721 to 742 mV, and the FF increases from 0.658 to 0.686. In this study, the 0.01 M Zr/N-doped TiO2 electrode exhibited an energy conversion efficiency of 8.25%, which is a 57.14% enhancement compared to the measured efficiency of the cell with no added Zr. This improved cell efficiency originates from the combination between an increased dye loading and a reduced band gap. The 0.01 M Zr/N-doped TiO2 photoelectrode had the highest surface area and the lowest band gap value, as previously described. This increases the adsorption of the dye, the short-circuit current, and the optical response under visible light irradiation, which improves the energy conversion efficiency.9,28 However, further addition of Zr led to a drastic decrease in cell efficiency. This is due to the sharp reduction in dye loading at high Zr contents, as shown in Fig. 5.
To investigate the charge-transfer properties of the DSSCs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out under 1 sun illumination with direct current (DC) bias voltages of 0.65 V and 0.1 V in amplitude over the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz.2 Fig. 7 shows the characteristic EIS spectra for DSSCs based on P25 and 0.01 M Zr/N-doped TiO2 photoelectrodes. The EIS spectra for DSSCs consists of three semicircles attributed to the impedance for FTO/TiO2 and Pt-FTO/electrolyte interface, TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, and the diffusion of I3− in the electrolyte. The size of the semicircle in the low-frequency region becomes much smaller for the 0.01 M Zr/N-doped TiO2 electrode as compared to that for the P25 electrode. This indicates a lower electron transfer resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface18,29 due to the enhanced charge transport and reduced charge recombination rate of the 0.01 M Zr/N-doped TiO2 photoelectrode. And the nanoparticle structure of the 0.01 M Zr/N-doped TiO2 electrode was uniform and compact compared with the P25 electrode as shown in Fig. 4. These nanoparticle structures would be reduced the grain boundary resistance, resulting in the enhancement of charge transport.

As previously reported by other researchers, TiCl4 post-treatment can improve the DSSC efficiency,30,31 so we performed the TiCl4 treatments on both the P25 and Zr/N-doped TiO2 photoelectrodes. Fig. 8 shows the J–V characteristics obtained from cells made of P25 and Zr/N-doped TiO2 photoelectrodes after the TiCl4 treatment, and the photovoltaic characteristics are listed in Table 2. In comparison with the cell efficiencies obtained before TiCl4 treatment, the Jsc, Voc, FF, and energy conversion efficiency were drastically improved for all modified photoelectrodes. The 0.01 M Zr/N-doped TiO2 photoelectrode showed the maximum energy conversion efficiency of 12.62%, which is enhanced by 53% compared with the efficiency of the untreated photoelectrode (see Table 1). The enhancement in the short-circuit current is especially remarkable, and it is more noticeable in the cells with lower energy conversion efficiencies. This improvement may be because the TiCl4 treatment improves the interparticle connections and electron transfer.6 Furthermore, TiCl4 treatment produces an improved photoelectrode surface, which increases Jsc by promoting the dye loading on the photoelectrode surface.30 In addition, the electrodes were sintered again at 450 °C during TiCl4 treatment which may cause the amorphous structures to crystallize in the photoelectrodes with high Zr contents. In any case, the TiCl4 treatment dramatically improved the photovoltaic performance in this study.

4 Conclusions
We were successfully prepared Zr/N-doped TiO2 nanoparticles using a sol–gel method, along with Zr/N-doped TiO2 photoelectrodes for DSSCs. The addition of Zr could effectively suppress the phase transformation and stabilize the crystalline form of the Zr/N-doped TiO2 nanoparticles. Furthermore, the traces of Zr/N-doped TiO2 nanoparticles exhibited higher surface areas, enhanced charge transfer, and reducing charge recombination. A DSSC assembled with a Zr/N-doped TiO2 photoelectrode show the highest maximum energy conversion efficiency of 12.62% at a Zr doping content of 0.01 M, which represents a dramatic enhancement compared to the energy conversion efficiency of 8.32% obtained with commercial Degussa P25. Furthermore, the short-circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF) were also improved for all modified photoelectrodes. The increase in cell efficiency due to Zr and N doping is attributed to the increase in surface area, which enabled higher dye loading, and the reduction in the charge recombination, which enhanced the charge transfer. In addition, TiCl4 treatment enhanced the interparticle connections and the charge transport.
