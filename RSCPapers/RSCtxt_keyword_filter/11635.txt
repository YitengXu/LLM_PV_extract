    , Accepted 16th November 2018First published on 19th November 2018AbstractImproving the film quality is of great importance in promoting the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2D perovskite-based solar cells (PVSCs), but the solution to this issue is limited. In this work, a strategy of combining the advantages of the ammonium thiocyanate (NH4SCN) additive and merged annealing (MA) process was applied to fabricate a high quality 2D (PEA)2(CH3NH3)4Pb5I16 (PEA = phenylethylammonium, n = 5) film. The optimized planar-structured PVSC with the inverted structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/(PEA)2(CH3NH3)4Pb5I16/PC61BM/BCP/Ag presents a high fill factor of 0.77 and the best PCE of 13.01%. This FF is the highest value for low-n (n < 10) 2D PVSCs. The performance elevation can be attributed to the NH4SCN assisted highly vertical orientation together with the MA process induced crystallinity improvement and effective defect passivation, which resulted in efficient charge transport and reduced nonradiative recombination. The unsealed device retains 50% of its original PCE after 30 day storage in air with a humidity of 25 ± 5%. The high-quality perovskite thin-film with low trap density exhibits suppressed dark current density. The MA-based device presents the highest shot noise limited specific detectivity over 1012 Jones in the visible region. This work provides an effective approach toward high-performance and stable PVSCs and photodetectors for future commercialization.
1 Introduction
Organic and inorganic hybrid perovskites with a three-dimensional (3D) structure have emerged as a revolutionary class of photovoltaic materials.1–9 The world record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) is over 22.7%,10 but long-term stability of 3D perovskites in a humid atmosphere is still a challenge for the practical applications of PVSCs.
Recently, two dimensional (2D) perovskites with the chemical formula of  (A is the spacer cation, including CH3(CH2)3NH3+ (BA+), C6H5(CH2)2NH3+ (PEA+), NH3C4H9COO+, etc., A′ is CH3NH3+, HC(NH2)2+ or Cs+, B is Pb2+ or Sn2+, n ≥ 2) have been developed and applied as the active layer of PVSCs,11–19 for the purpose of overcoming the low formation energy and the hygroscopic nature of the MAPbI3 perovskite.20,21 Owing to the stronger van der Waals interaction between the spacer cations and the inorganic units, more energy is required to remove the spacer cations from the 2D perovskite.22 On the other hand, the spacer cation is more hydrophobic than the A′ cation, which helps to enhance the moisture stability of the 2D perovskites.23
Because of the wide bandgap and the insulating layer of spacer cations, the 2D PVSCs presented low short-circuit current density (Jsc) and low PCE, compared to their 3D counterparts. Hot-casting, additive assisted and solvent engineering methods were proved to be effective in realizing the vertically oriented growth of 2D perovskites on the substrate.24–29 The highest PCE of 2D perovskite based solar cells with an inverted structure was up to 12.52%.24 However, the reported fill factors (FFs) for most 2D PVSCs are lower than 70%. Theoretically, the upper limit of the FF value for PVSCs could be elevated to about 90%.30 FF is heavily influenced by many factors, including the quality of the perovskite film and the corresponding contact resistance.31,32 In other words, elevating the quality of the perovskite film and the resulting FF level will be an efficient strategy to increase the PCE.
Fabricating a high-quality perovskite film with low trap density was proved to be effective in promoting the PCE of 3D PVSCs. Previous studies revealed that the quality of the 3D perovskite film can be controlled and optimized through different approaches, such as precursor composition,33 deposition methods,2,34,35 solvent engineering,36,37 additives,38,39 interfacial engineering,40–45 and thermal/solvent annealing.46,47 But for 2D PVSCs, fabricating a 2D perovskite film with high quality and low trap density is still a big challenge.
Herein, we prepared a 2D perovskite (PEA)2(CH3NH3)4Pb5I16 (n = 5) film on the PEDOT:PSS substrate by a merged annealing (MA) process with the aid of the ammonium thiocyanate (NH4SCN) additive. The influence of NH4SCN concentration in the precursor and the MA process on the quality of the (PEA)2(CH3NH3)4Pb5I16 (n = 5) film was studied. The (PEA)2(CH3NH3)4Pb5I16 (n = 5) film, prepared by the MA process, with an optimized amount of NH4SCN addition exhibits intensified crystallinity, a smooth surface, low trap density and preferable vertically oriented growth on the PEDOT:PSS substrate. The planar-structured PVSCs with the inverted structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/(PEA)2(CH3NH3)4Pb5I16 (n = 5)/PC61BM/BCP/Ag presented a high FF of 0.77 and the best PCE of 13.01%.
2 Result and discussion
A schematic PVSC device structure, ITO/PEDOT:PSS/(PEA)2(CH3NH3)4Pb5I16 (n = 5)/PC61BM/BCP/Ag, is presented in Fig. 1a. The corresponding J–V curves of the MA-based PVSCs are shown in Fig. 1b. The influence of NH4SCN concentration in the precursor solution was discussed firstly and then the influence of the MA process on the device performance will be discussed below. The addition amount of NH4SCN was adjusted by changing the molar ratio of NH4SCN to PbI2 in the precursor solution, abbreviated as x SCN (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2). The absorption spectra of the (PEA)2(MA)4Pb5I16 (n = 5) perovskite films with various amounts of NH4SCN additive were recorded and the results are shown in Fig. S1,† which are similar to the reported spectra of 2D perovskite films with n ≤ 5.26,28Table 1 lists the photovoltaic parameters of the corresponding PVSCs. Large series resistance (RS) related to the barrier of the spacer cation layer to charge transport is regarded as the main reason of the low Jsc of the randomly oriented 2D PVSCs,48 so is the case of the (PEA)2(CH3NH3)4Pb5I16 (n = 5) film without the NH4SCN additive in Table 1. The RS decreases with the addition of NH4SCN and reaches the lowest value in the case of 1.5 SCN. As a result, the FF increases from 0.41 (0 SCN) to 0.77 (1.5 SCN), which is the highest value for the low n (n < 10) 2D PVSCs with an inverted structure. Jsc increases from the original 1.04 mA cm−2 (0 SCN) to the highest value of 15.36 mA cm−2 along with the increase of the NH4SCN amount to 1.5 SCN. The remarkable increase of the FF and Jsc leads to an improvement of the device PCE from the original 0.46% (0 SCN) to the best value of 13.01% (1.5 SCN). The average PCE value of 30 devices is about 12.62%. An excessive amount of NH4SCN addition exerts a negative effect on the device performance. Fig. 1c presents the result of the photocurrent density where PCE is a function of time at the maximum power point (0.90 V). The photocurrent remains stable toward 250 s scan, and a stable PCE output of 12.72% is obtained. Fig. 1d shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum and the corresponding integrated photocurrent curve for the optimized device. The integrated photocurrent (Jcal) calculated from the EQE spectrum is 14.31 mA cm−2, closely matching the Jsc value measured from the J–V curve.

Vertically oriented growth of the 2D perovskite film is believed to be the key factor to overcome the barrier of the insulating spacer cation layer to charge transport.24–26,49,50 For the (PEA)2(CH3NH3)4Pb5I16 (n = 5) perovskite film without the NH4SCN additive, as shown in the cross-sectional SEM image in Fig. 2a, small compactly packed crystalline grains can be detected, which leads to the lowest Jsc value in Table 1. Once NH4SCN was added, brick-shaped grains can be clearly observed (Fig. 2b–e). In the case of 1.5 SCN, the crystalline grains of the (PEA)2(CH3NH3)4Pb5I16 (n = 5) grow bigger. There is almost no grain boundary along the vertical direction, which can be regarded as the reason for the reduction of RS in Table 1. Similar vertically oriented morphology was also observed in the previous reported BA and PEA based 2D perovskites,25,26 which is beneficial for PCE improvement through increasing the carrier diffusion length and decreasing the charge recombination.
 Fig. 2  Cross-sectional SEM images of the MA process based (PEA)2(CH3NH3)4Pb5I16 (n = 5) perovskite films with various additive ratios of NH4SCN on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate (the scale bar is 1 μm). 
Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were carried out to further indicate the additive induced orientation direction of the perovskite crystals. The results are given in Fig. S2.† The 2D GIWAXS pattern of the (PEA)2(MA)4Pb5I16 (n = 5) film without NH4SCN exhibits ring-like diffraction features, implying relatively random orientation. For the film with 1.5 SCN, sharp and discrete Bragg spots are observed, indicating the formation of well aligned perovskite layers. The XRD patterns of the (PEA)2(CH3NH3)4Pb5I16 (n = 5) films with different amounts of NH4SCN addition shown in Fig. S3a† can also give evidence for the NH4SCN induced improvement of the crystallinity of the (PEA)2(CH3NH3)4Pb5I16 (n = 5) film. Random orientation and low crystallinity of the perovskite film can be deduced from the 0 SCN pattern. As shown in Fig. S3b,† NH4SCN addition strengthens the diffraction peak at 14°, attributed to the (101) lattice plane of the (PEA)2(CH3NH3)4Pb5I16 (n = 5) films,27 and decreases the corresponding full width at half maximum (FWHM), indicating an improvement in crystallinity of the perovskite film, such as bigger crystalline grains and fewer grain boundaries.51 The diffraction peak of the perovskite film does not change with the addition of NH4SCN. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. S4,† no SCN− signals around 2080 cm−1 can be found in the Raman spectra of perovskite films with NH4SCN addition when compared to that of the pristine NH4SCN film, indicating that NH4SCN is almost evaporated during the thermal annealing period.25 It is assumed that NH4SCN addition can favor the vertically oriented growth of the 2D perovskite film through the coordination bonding between SCN− and Pb2+.26
The FF value in Table 1 is the highest value for the low n (n < 10) 2D PVSCs. To reveal the origin of the high FF and the positive effect of the MA process on the quality and property of the 2D (PEA)2(CH3NH3)4Pb5I16 (n = 5) film, a detailed comparison between the MA process and the conventional annealing (CA) process was carried out below. Fig. 3a shows the J–V curves of the PVSCs fabricated by the MA and CA processes, under the standard 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G solar illumination in reverse and forward scans. The addition amount of NH4SCN was fixed at 1.5 SCN.
 Fig. 3  (a) J–V curves of the PVSCs made by the CA and MA processes. (b) PCE histogram of 30 devices made by the CA and MA processes. 
The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The device fabricated by the CA process presents a Voc of 1.08 V, a Jsc of 14.84 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.65, yielding a PCE of 10.42% in the reverse scan. In the forward scan, the PCE is 9.32%, with a Voc = 1.04 V, a Jsc = 14.45 mA cm−2, and a FF = 0.62. The MA-based device exhibits a noticeable improvement of performance in both the reverse (PCE = 13.01%, Voc = 1.10 V, Jsc = 15.36 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.77) and forward (PCE = 12.00%, Voc = 1.09 V, Jsc = 15.39 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.72) scans. The improved performance is mainly attributed to the apparently promoted FF and Jsc, in which the improvement of the FF value, over 18%, is more obvious, indicating the positive effect of the MA process on promoting the FF value. The improvement of FF can be ascribed to the penetration of PC61BM inside the perovskite film and the resulting defect passivation and reduced nonradiative recombination.31,32 Meanwhile, the decreased hysteresis index (HI) calculated according to a previous report52 can also support the suppression of trap density. The reduced RS value can be attributed to the decreased contact resistance, which can be regarded as another reason for the improvement of the FF value. Fig. 3b shows the PCE histograms of 30 individual devices employing different annealing processes. Over 60% of the MA-based devices show a PCE > 12.5%, with the average PCE being 12.62%, better than that of the CA-based devices.

Fig. 4 shows the SEM images of the perovskite films fabricated by different annealing processes. The perovskite film made by the MA process presents a smoother surface, proved by the AFM images shown in Fig. S5.† The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the MA-based film (7.645 nm) is smaller than that of the CA-based one (13.200 nm), which should be beneficial for improving the interface contact and decreasing the contact resistance. Thus, a high FF can be attained. The cross-sectional SEM images (Fig. 4c and d) showed that the crystalline grains of the film made by the MA process are larger than those of the CA-based ones, which is helpful for charge transport and the resulting Jsc elevation. GIWAXS measurements are also performed to further compare the crystallinity and orientation of the perovskite films fabricated by the CA and MA processes.53 The two-dimensional (2D) GIWAXS patterns are shown in Fig. 5a and b. Both films exhibit discrete Bragg spots, confirming the 2D nature of the perovskite (PEA)2(CH3NH3)4Pb5I16 films with the (01) planes parallel to the substrate.26 To compare the orientational order of the crystals, the polar integration versus χ (an angle with respect to the out-of-plane direction) along the (002) diffraction ring is presented in Fig. 5c. The film fabricated by the MA process shows a sharper diffraction peak spanning a χ angle of 7.06° (FWHM), compared with the 8.18° (FWHM) for the CA processed film. These results suggest that the MA process produces films with better aligned perovskite layers, in consistence with the observed better device performance. The XRD patterns of the corresponding films shown in Fig. S6† give more pieces of evidence. As labeled inside the figure, the FWHM of the (101) peak decreases from 0.195° (CA) to 0.165° (MA) along with the increase of peak intensity from 8.42 × 106 (CA) to 1.59 × 107 (MA), indicating the improved crystallinity of the perovskite film, ascribed to bigger crystalline grains and fewer grain boundaries, which is beneficial for reducing the trap density and the nonradiative recombination.54 This observation is consistent with the SEM image and the GIWAXS results.

The white arcs illustrate the area of polar integration. (c) The polar intensity profiles in the q range of 1.35 to 1.50 Å−1 of the PVSCs made by the CA (blue) and MA (red) processes. 
The time-resolved PL measurements were also conducted and are shown in Fig. S7a.† Table S1† summarizes the corresponding results. The lifetime is shortened from 4.08 ns (CA) to 3.04 ns (MA). The fast decay lifetime τ1 of the two samples decreased from 0.50 ns (CA) to 0.40 ns (MA), while the weight fraction increased from 71.58% (CA) to 88.03% (MA), indicating that the MA process can improve the electron extraction from the perovskite to PC61BM. Fig. S7b† shows the normalized steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of (PEA)2(CH3NH3)4Pb5I16 (n = 5) films, respectively, made by the CA and MA processes on the PEDOT:PSS substrate with PC61BM above. The small blue-shift of the PL peak by 6 nm from 756 to 750 nm observed in the PL spectra was attributed to the defect passivation. Similar passivation effect induced small blue-shifts of the PL peak by 3–5 nm were also reported.55 The defect passivation can be ascribed to PC61BM infiltrated into the boundary of the MA-based perovskite film. As a result, the recombination of the charge carriers was suppressed.31,56
The J–V curves in the dark state of the devices fabricated by different annealing processes are shown in Fig. 6a. The MA-based device presents lower dark current than the CA-based one. When the reverse bias is beyond −0.87 V, different from the MA-based device, obvious current leakage was observed for the CA-based device, which suggested defects in the morphology of the CA-based film. The standard diode equation I = Is[exp(qV/nkT) − 1] was applied to fit the dark current, in which q is the electronic charge, V is the applied voltage, k is the Boltzmann constant, n is the ideality factor, and Is is the saturation current. The ideality factor n for the MA and CA based devices is found to be 1.26 and 1.98, respectively. The J–V characteristics of the MA-based device are closer to the ideal diode characteristics. The above phenomenon might be ascribed to the lower trap state density and less recombination of the MA-based perovskite film,57 which explains the high FF value attained. Jsc and Voc values versus light intensity are measured to further study the recombination kinetics. Fig. 6b shows that the slopes are both 0.98 for the curves of Jscversus light intensity, indicating that almost all carriers are swept out prior to recombination under short-circuit conditions.58 Under open-circuit conditions, all carriers recombine within the cell. Thus, charge recombinations under open circuit conditions are particularly sensitive to the details of the recombination mechanism. Fig. 6c shows that Voc varies logarithmically (ln(I)) versus light intensity. The slopes are 1.43kT/e and 1.06kT/e for the devices fabricated by the CA and MA processes, respectively. The larger slope for the CA-based device indicates more serious monomolecular recombination than in the MA-based one, resulting from more defects, which is consistent with their small grain size and poor crystallinity characterized by the measurements mentioned above. It is believed that the fewer trap states, due to the enlarged grain size with fewer grain boundaries and the PC61BM induced trap passivation in the MA-based perovskite film, help to reduce the monomolecular recombination and improve the FF value.

(b) Measured Jsc of PVSCs made by the CA and MA processes plotted against light intensity (dots) on a logarithmic scale, together with linear fits (solid lines) to the data. (c) Measured Voc of PVSCs made by the CA and MA processes plotted against light intensity (dots), together with linear fits (solid lines) to the data. 
Owing to the low dark current level, the device can also be applied as a photodetector for visible light detection. The shot noise limited specific detectivity (D*) was first derived, which can be calculated from the equation D* = R/(2qJdark)1/2, in which q is the elementary charge and R is the responsivity.59R can be expressed as R = ΔJ/(Winc), in which Winc is the incident light intensity and ΔJ = Jlight − Jdark. The shot noise limited D* of the devices fabricated by the CA and MA processes is calculated and presented in Fig. 7a as a function of wavelength. The bias voltage is −0.1 V and the light source is 100 mW cm−2 white light. Both of the devices exhibit an almost flat D* curve over a broad spectral range from 350 to 750 nm. The highest shot noise limited D* value in the visible region of the optimized MA-based device is beyond 1012 Jones (cm Hz1/2 W−1), which is three times higher than that of the CA-based device. The values of spectral density of noise of the MA-based device, including 1/f noise (SI(1/f)), shot noise (SI(shot)), and thermal noise (SI(thermal)), were calculated to be 2.0 × 10−21 (Fig. S8,† 10 Hz), 9.67 × 10−27 and 5.00 × 10−27 A2 Hz−1, respectively. The details of the calculation are given in the ESI.† The noise equivalent power (NEP) was evaluated by considering the above mentioned noises and is expressed as NEP = [SI(1/f) + SI(shot) + SI(thermal)]1/2/R,60 wherein R is the responsivity. The NEP value is calculated to be 3.02 × 10−10. According to the equation D* = S1/2/NEP (S is the area of the device), the specific detectivity D* was calculated and the results are shown in Fig. S9.† For the reason that the 1/f noise is much higher than the shot noise, the highest D* calculated from the NEP (2.64 × 109 Jones) is lower than the shot noise limited D*. In other words, in the low frequency region, the D* calculated from dark current will be overestimated, because the 1/f noise dominates the total noise of the device instead of the shot noise due to the charge trapping and detrapping processes.61 The photocurrent of the MA-based device under illumination with white light with various intensities is plotted in Fig. S10.† The linear relationship between the current density and the light intensity can be detected in the range of 0.06–100 mW cm−2.

(b) The periodical photocurrent response of the MA-based device under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G solar illumination. (c) The transient response measured using 530 nm incident light with a frequency of 165 Hz. 
The on–off behaviour of the device was characterized by measuring the current as a function of time when the light was periodically turned on and off. It can be clearly seen from Fig. 7b that the device can be switched on and off repeatedly. To identify the response time, we introduced incident light of 530 nm with a frequency of 165 Hz as the light source. The light response/decay time can be evaluated using the time it takes for the voltage change to reach 90% of the whole amplitude of variation. Here, the light response/decay time of about 0.45 ms and 0.40 ms can be detected (Fig. 7c).
Finally, we investigated the stability of the perovskite film and the corresponding device based on the MA process. Performance stability of the optimized device (unsealed) in an air atmosphere with humidities of 25 ± 5% and 55 ± 5% is shown in Fig. S11.† The device maintained around 50% of its initial efficiency after 30 days of exposure to air (Hr = 25 ± 5%) and is much more stable than the MAPbI3 based device. In the case of higher humidity, 55 ± 5%, the device retained 77.6% of its original PCE after being kept in air for 6 days and degraded to about 50% after another 6 days, which is comparable to previous reports.24
3 Experiment
3.1 Materials
Phenylethyl-ammonium iodide (PEAI, 99%) and bathocuproine (BCP, 99%) were purchased from TCI. NH4SCN (99%) and methyl-ammonium iodide (MAI, 99%) were ordered from Sigma and MaterWin. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) aqueous solution (Al 4083) was purchased from Baytron. (6,6)-Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM, 99.5%) was purchased from American Dye Source. PbI2 (99%) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. All reagents and solvents were used directly if not specified.
3.2 Characterization
The steady-state photoluminescence (steady PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were taken on an FLSP920 from Edinburgh Instruments. Film morphologies were studied through the scanning electron-microscope (SEM) images obtained from a Hitachi S-4800. The SEM images of the MA produced perovskite were attained by selectively removing the PC61BM layer from the perovskite/PC61BM film by rinsing with chlorobenzene (CB). The Raman spectra were obtained by using a Renishaw inVia system with a 1 mW power 532 nm laser. The laser spot size is about 1 μm. AFM images were taken with a Veeco 3D atomic force microscope under the tapping mode. Crystallographic properties of the perovskite films were investigated using a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation of 0.15406 nm (graphite mono-chromatic) at a scanning rate of 10° min−1. GIWAXS measurements were carried out with a Xeuss 2.0 SAXS/WAXS laboratory beamline using a Cu X-ray source (8.05 keV, 1.54 Å) and a Pilatus3R 300 K detector. The incidence angle is 0.2°. The temporal response of the photocurrent was evaluated by using a 530 nm laser at 165 Hz.
3.3 Device fabrication and measurements
ITO glass was cleaned consecutively with detergent (2 vol% Hellmanex III), deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol and in an ethanol ultrasonic bath for 15 min, respectively, dried under nitrogen flow, and treated with UV–ozone for 20 min before use. A thin layer of PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated onto the cleaned ITO at 4000 rpm for 40 s and baked in air at 140 °C for 20 min. Then the substrates were transferred into a glovebox for active layer deposition and further device fabrication. Perovskite precursor solutions were prepared by mixing NH4SCN, PEAI, MAI and PbI2 in a molar ratio of 1.5:2:4:5 in 1 mL DMF, the concentration is 1 M (based on PbI2) and the solution was stirred at 70 °C overnight in a N2 glovebox. For the conventional annealing (CA) process, 30 μL of the precursor solution was spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS coated ITO (ITO/PEDOT:PSS) substrate at 5000 rpm for 45 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 15 min. Then PC61BM (20 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) and BCP (0.5 mg mL−1 in ethanol) were deposited subsequently at 2000 rpm for 45 s and 3000 rpm for 45 s, respectively. For the merged annealing (MA) process, 30 μL of the precursor solution was spin-coated onto the ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate at 5000 rpm for 45 s, followed by the deposition of PC61BM (20 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) on the perovskite film, and then annealed together at 100 °C for 15 min. BCP was deposited (0.5 mg mL−1 in absolute ethanol) at 3000 rpm for 45 s. Finally, Ag (100 nm) was deposited in a vacuum chamber under a high vacuum of 5 × 10−4 Pa. The device area is 0.06 cm2 with the metal mask.
The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) performance of the devices was measured on a Keithley source measure unit with a sweep speed of 0.02 V s−1 in a N2 glovebox, under 1 sun AM 1.5 G illumination from a solar simulator (Enlitech, Taiwan), calibrated with a standard photovoltaic cell (certificated by the National Institute of Metrology). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum was measured using a Stanford Research System Model SR830 lock-in amplifier unit coupled with a monochromator and a 500 W xenon lamp, and a calibrated Si photodiode with known spectral response was used as a reference. For the measurement of the response time, an optical chopper was used to provide the light pulse with a frequency of 165 Hz, and a Tektronix oscilloscope was used to record the voltage variation of the resistor. The perovskite solar cells were kept in a humidity-controlled cabinet (Hr = 50 ± 5% and 25 ± 5%, Bossmen, PR1852(A)-SH) for humidity-stability measurements.
4 Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrated the fabrication of a high quality 2D perovskite (PEA)2(CH3NH3)4Pb5I16 (n = 5) film with intensified crystallinity, preferable vertically oriented growth, a smoother surface and fewer traps through combining the NH4SCN additive and the merged annealing process. The optimized solar cell exhibited a much improved FF value of up to 0.77 and a PCE of 13.01%. This FF is the highest value for the low-n (n < 10) 2D PVSCs. The unsealed device retained 77.6% of its original PCE after 6 days of storage in an air atmosphere with a humidity of 55 ± 5%. The device presented low dark current density and highest specific detectivity over 1012 Jones in the visible region. This study gives the possibility to fabricate PVSCs with high PCE and good stability. The device can also be applied as a photodetector with high sensitivity to visible light.
