    , Accepted 23rd August 2019First published on 26th August 2019AbstractOrganic photovoltaic materials (OPVs), with low cost and structure flexibility, are of great interest and importance for their application in solar cell device development. However, the optimization of new OPV structures and the study of the structure arrangements and packing morphologies when materials are blended takes time and consumes raw materials, thus theoretical models could be of considerable value. In this work, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of present OPVs to understand the morphological packing of the donor–acceptor (DA) phases and DA heterojunction during evaporation and annealing processes, following inter and intramolecular properties like frontier orbitals, π–π stacking, coordination, distances, angles, and aggregation. Our considered donor molecules were selected from already proved experimental studies and also from predicted optimal compounds, designed through high throughput studies. The acceptor molecule employed in all our studied systems was PCBM ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester). Furthermore, we also analyze the influence of including different lateral aliphatic chains on the structural properties of the resulting DA packing morphologies. Our results can guide the design of new OPVs and subsequent studies applying charge transport and charge separation models.
1 Introduction
Recently, the use of organic materials in electronic applications has experienced a significant increase, especially for alternative, clean energy production such as organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs). Despite their initial relatively low efficiency, as compared with traditional silicon solar cells, their use has increased in a relatively short time, highlighting their advantages such as low-cost fabrication and environmental friendliness. These characteristics feature them as one of the most promising renewables for the near future. Novel materials for OPV layers have been developed to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE), pushing its record for single-junction OPVs towards 13%1 and 17% for tandem devices,2 the latter being close to allowing them to compete with commercial solar cells.
The best performance for an OPV active layer has been associated with a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architecture which assembles two blended organic components with irregular order and a certain degree of phase separation.3,4 In this arrangement, its components are generally an electron donor molecule and an electron acceptor molecule, where structures such as polymers and fullerene derivatives are widely used.
Advances in donor materials for OPVs have shown the strong influence over the PCE of structural backbones, substituents, lateral chains, solvents, polymerization degree, thermal treatments, domain size, etc.5 For instance, extensive domains imply larger lengths, which affect negatively the short circuit current density (JSC), which is dependent on the carrier diffusion length and carrier lifetime.6 However, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) variation with respect to domain size is less important.7,8 For this reason, oligomers, with shorter domain size, have become as efficient as polymers.
On the other hand, large or branched side chains in donors can affect molecular distances and π–π stacking; frequently these modifications are preferred over those caused by shorter and linear side chains when looking for higher values of VOC. Anyhow, if VOC is improved by the best combination of side chains, JSC is usually diminished. Thus, a balance between VOC and JSC values must be achieved by different side-chain optimizations.5,9
Also, fluoridation in distinctive polymer motifs can shift the LUMO and HOMO orbital levels, influencing intra and intermolecular dipoles, which affect charge separation or improve the polymer domain purity. Similarly, polymers with conjugated donor–acceptor aromatic rings (DAr–AAr) have shown a longer lifetime of intramolecular charge polarization, supporting the idea that heteropolymers promote charge separation. Moreover, slow recombination is favored if structural spacer rings (π) are present between donor–acceptor polymer patterns.10,11 This asymmetric characteristic has been used on polymers or oligomers (small molecules) with structural motifs such as [DAr–AAr–DAr], [AAr–DAr–DAr–DAr–AAr], [DAr–AAr–DAr–AAr–DAr] or [AAr–π–DAr–π–AAr]. Single BHJ layers containing these donor materials have achieved an efficiency of around 9–10%, which make them more successful than poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) with single monomer repetition. Moreover, fundamental band gaps and hole transfer nonadiabatic couplings are highly correlated with backbone dihedrals, since planar configurations exhibit superior hole transport rates and alter the HOMO–LUMO gap, minimizing voltage and current losses.12–14
Empirical models of several BHJs have shown a correlation between the HOMO and LUMO orbitals of blended structures (HOMO located on the donor and LUMO on the acceptor) and the PCE or other specific properties such as VOC (which is related to the ease of charge separation). These models have idealized effective orbital energy differences for improving the current density and charge separation.15,16
Even though the effort to produce a massive number of new donor polymers has been accomplished in the last decade by the low-band-gap guidance, recent studies have revealed a strong correlation between PCE and morphology-dependent properties (JSC and Fill Factor, FF). The energy levels should provide the theoretical maximum of efficiency, but the real challenge is to find suitable morphology/microstructural arrangements that promote this event.17 Neglecting the optimization of the morphological landscape can result in a high VOC and a poor PCE.
To propose novel structures for donor molecules, theoretical models have been extensively used to calculate orbital differences, screening millions of molecules. The Harvard clean energy database (H-CEPDB)18–20 proposed new donor molecules based on the Scharber approximation,21 by calculating the PCE under the assumption of a quantum efficiency and FF of 0.65. Although some experimental aspects are not considered (its properties correspond to isolated molecules or shorter polymers, while side chains and the presence of the acceptor material are omitted), results for electronic levels correlate adequately with experimental facts.18–20,22,23 However, the variation of rotatable angles between conjugated rings present in donor molecules, not included in the models mentioned above, may have a significant effect on electronic parameters and microstructure arrangements. Additionally, to improve on the modeling of charge transfer processes, a correct description of the geometrical arrangement and molecular orientation is necessary.
Numerous studies have indicated the possibility of constructing artificial organic donor–acceptor blends representing planar or BHJ architectures. These can be represented by lattice models24,25 that deal with the electronic dynamic of excitons and free charges by rigorous theory, in fact, it has been proved how the interphase disorder mediates the free-carrier transport. Also, different donor–acceptor models can be constructed from multiple steps of Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, allowing the study of larger systems.26 Atoms in this approach are generally treated in atomistic (all-atom)27,28 or coarse-grain representations.29 MD simulations allow quantifying micro or macrostructural/morphological changes of the interfacial area, pair atom distribution functions, phase segregation, density profiles, etc.29–31 Furthermore, the electronic dynamics of excitons and free charges can be determined at an atomistic-morphology resolution by Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations, which can elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible for the separation of the charge-transfer state,32 electron hopping33 or electron–hole mobilities.27 These approaches are relevant to the understanding and improvement of JSC, waiting for better PCE.34–37
Synthesis, characterization, and optimization of ideal BHJ interphases are time-consuming. To optimize selected new donors, it is possible to use guidance from other theoretical approximations that incorporate degrees of freedom over molecular orientations, such as MD models. Therefore, we focus our work on atomistic MD simulations to improve the analysis of heterojunction blends, by exploring the BHJ packing properties of new predicted donors with similar PCE values, and create selection filters of these lead molecules.
In the present work, atomistic MD simulations have been conducted to emulate solvent evaporation for building prototype BHJ blends using new electron donors proposed theoretically.18–20 Morphological packing analyses were performed, evaluating contacts and orientations of donor and acceptor molecules. These are studied by observing the degree of interconnection within a homogenous phase (i.e. donor–donor or acceptor–acceptor), measuring an aggregation index, and the interconnection at the interphase of a single material. Also, the statistical description of the structure intermolecular arrangement effect on the frontier orbitals is reported. And finally, thermal treatment and the side-chain influence on the BHJ packing was studied to guide BHJ optimization based on lead molecules.
2 Computational details
2.1 Molecules
To construct the donor–acceptor systems, we select the PCBM molecule ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester, Fig. S1, ESI†) as the reference acceptor. The donors studied in this work include the renowned P3HT (poly(3-hexylthiophene)) polymer modeled as a four-monomer oligomer, with and without side chains, labeled 4-T (Fig. 1(a)) and 4-3HT, respectively. For the latter, hexyl groups were connected to each monomer with 75% regioregularity (Fig. 1(b)). To analyse and compare new donors, we selected three molecules predicted by H-CEPDB18–20 with a theoretical PCE of ∼11% (Fig. 1(d–f)); these molecules contain four monomers and three rotatable bonds, as in the case of the thiophene oligomer, but do not include side chains. Additionally, for the C271 system side chains were added to study their effect (Fig. 1(g–i)). Finally, the previously experimentally studied8 o-BDTdFBT (benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole) oligomer was included as another donor reference without omission of the oligomer length nor the presence of side chains (Fig. 1(c)).

2.2 Parameter derivation of charges and dihedral potentials
In order to perform atomistic MD calculations for all systems (including the donor, acceptor and solvent), the General AMBER Force Field38 (GAFF) was used. Atomic charges were calculated using the Hirshfeld iterative method (H-Iter, Fig. S2, ESI†), where an atom-weighted function associated with the promolecular density is optimized in an iterative procedure to determine the individual electron densities on each atom.39,40 This charge population method has been proved to be successfully implemented with GAFF, providing quite better results than RESP charge assignation.41 Single-molecule geometry optimization and H-Iter charge assignment were carried out through Density Functional Theory (DFT) by using the cc-pVTZ basis set and ω-B97XD functional in the Q-Chem4.0 package.42
Molecular mechanics (MM) torsional barriers were found through corrections of the GAFF force field implemented in the AMBER16 software.43 Dihedral angles in rotatable bonds were described by adjusting parameters in the cosine potential as shown in eqn (1), (1)where referential energetic torsion barriers were calculated with the previously mentioned DFT approximations. Each torsional angle was optimized independently by varying it in 15 degrees steps, to obtain Vdihedral parameters. Details of the genetic algorithm44 used to optimize the parameters are presented in the ESI.† Notice that no side chains were included in torsional calculations (Fig. S3, ESI†).
2.3 Solvent evaporation
To build donor/acceptor systems with a final proportion of 1:1 w/w approximately, 40 PCBM molecules were added (60 PCBM molecules in the o-BDTdFBT system). Initially, the systems had donor and acceptor concentrations of 60 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene (Fig. S1, ESI†). This concentration defines the number of donor molecules (minimum 26 for larger chains, maximum 84 for 4-T) and the system volume (1000 to 1400 nm3); 4799 solvent molecules are initially present (7249 for the o-BDTdFBT system).
Everything was carried out with the AMBER16 suite. Our evaporation processes (Fig. S4, ESI†) were based on a previous study,29 and started with energy minimizations of 250 steps of steepest descent algorithm combined with 250 steps of gradient conjugated algorithm. Later, NVT ensembles increased the temperature to 1000 K (400 ps) linearly, then the temperature was decreased to 300 K (50 ps) and kept at this value for 350 ps. NPT ensemble simulations were performed during the evaporation production at 1 bar and a compressibility of 100 × 10−6 bar−1, where 1.25% of the remaining solvent molecules were randomly removed every 2.2 ns. When the remotion was less than or equal to 0.20% of the initial solvent molecules, this value was fixed thereafter for removal. Upon total solvent evaporation, a final NPT production of 40 ns was employed to generate evaporated-phase analysis. The dynamics were integrated each 2 fs step, using a Langevin thermostat that used a collision frequency of 2.0 ps−1, whereas constant pressure was fixed using a Berendsen barostat with a relaxation time of 5.0 ps. The semi-isotropic scheme was implemented during the evaporation production, while an isotropic treatment was used in the final 40 ns MD simulation. Long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated with the Particle–Mesh Ewald (PME) method, using periodic boundary conditions. The cut-off for non-bonded calculations was set to 8 Å, whereas all bonds involving hydrogen atoms were kept rigid using the SHAKE constraint algorithm.
2.4 Annealing treatment process
For analyzing the stability or modifications of the as-cast phases, thermal processes were implemented.29 These post-treatments consisted of linear temperature increments up to 700 K (50 ns) from the evaporated phases at 300 K; constant temperature for 450 ns at 700 K and linear temperature reduction for 50 ns back to 300 K, ending with a production simulation of 150 ns at 300 K. The final analysis was obtained over the last 40 ns of the simulation. The MD parameters were the same as the ones used in the solvent evaporation section, but in this case, an isotropic scheme was employed.
2.5 Frontier orbitals
To study the electronic effects of BHJ packing morphologies, an electronic structure calculation of the resulting structures was attempted. To do so, all pairs of molecules present in the stabilized phases (donor–donor, acceptor–acceptor) were extracted, and for these adducts, HOMO, LUMO and gap values were obtained by DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level (Fig. 2). o-BDTdFBT/PCBM and 4-3HT/PCBM systems were chosen to adjust the theoretical results with experimental data. First, normalized histograms of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals were made for each component (donor–donor: 4-3HT and o-BDTdFBT, acceptor–acceptor: PCBMo-BDTdFBT and PCBM4-3HT), and averages of the distribution were calculated. Theoretical molecular orbital averages (MOTeo) and experimental molecular orbital values (MOExp) were plotted and correlated by a linear regression process. Finally, each MOTeo was shifted by mMOTeo + b with m = 0.92476 and b = 0.80839 to be corrected. It is worth noticing that the HOMO and LUMO orbital values for PCBMo-BDTdFBT and PCBM4-3HT were close (see Table S1, ESI†), hence the average of these values was taken for the regression explained above. Since the experimental values for P3HT correspond to polymers, and it is well known that short oligomers have larger gap values, oligomers 4-3HT required correction; molecular orbital calculations for different monomer lengths of thiophene (4, 8, 10, 16 and 30 monomers) were done to predict the asymptotic change in the HOMO and LUMO energies (see Fig. S5, ESI†). Finally HOMO, LUMO and gap calculations of donor–acceptor mixed pairs were used to estimate VOC values according to VOC = ECTq−1 − 0.6V, where ECT is the charge-transfer state emission and q is the elementary charge.45,46 In this work we make the assumption that ECT = gapDA = |HOMODA − LUMODA|, while each frontier orbital is a corrected molecular orbital average for the mixed species.

2.6 Molecular nearest neighbors (MNN)
Instructions in MDAnalysis 0.15.047,48 were created to analyze the radial distances between molecules of different kinds (Python codes are available on the website https://github.com/afmarmolejov/BHJ-morphologygithub.com/afmarmolejov/BHJ-morphology). A surface is defined around a molecule i by adding up spheres of radius r around each atom in the molecule. Another molecule j is considered to belong to this volume if at least one of its atoms is inside, defining Nij(r) (see Fig. 3). This process is applied to all molecules i. Averages of the number of molecules are used to construct a molecular distribution function χij, which counts the number of molecules j within a shell between r and r + Δr (Δr = 0.2 Å) around molecule i. The total molecular distribution function is obtained by adding up all kinds of possible pairs of molecules, according to the following equations, (2) (3)
 Fig. 3  Molecular regions used to define partial and total molecular distribution functions. The red region corresponds to a shell between r and r + Δr. The red molecule is inside that shell and is discarded from the blue shell. The blue molecule belongs to the blue shell. The black molecule is outside the shells shown in this figure. 
In this and the following analysis of molecular arrangements, hydrogen atoms and atoms belonging to side chains were omitted.
2.7 Characterization of aggregates
Aggregates are defined as regions where molecules of the same kind (donors or acceptors) are interconnected. Remote molecules within an aggregate are connected if similar molecules make up a bridge between them. The partial molecular distribution function was used to identify nearest neighbors within Nii(0 Å) and Nii(4 Å). An iterative process searched for shared molecules of the same kind between first neighbor shells, allowing us to define aggregated regions (km). The number of individual aggregates was weighted by the number of molecules of type i (Ni) obtaining INii– thus, no aggregation corresponds to INii = 1, that is Ni isolated molecules – while the largest aggregate (kmax) contributes a fraction Nmaxii of the total Ni molecules in the system – consequently, all molecules will belong to a single aggregate if Nmaxii = 1 and INii → 0. (4) (5)
2.8 Molecular interaction angles
π–π electronic interactions between conjugated rings in different molecules are considered important for adequate exciton and charge transfer. To measure possible π–π stacking, angles between donor–donor, θdd, and donor–acceptor, θda, rings were measured by defining vectors orthogonal to the rings, see Fig. 4(a). This stacking is studied in terms of the distance between molecules that contain rings, measured from their center of mass. For donor–donor interactions, rings separated by at most 6.0 Å were considered, thus the distances between molecules (ddd) go from ∼4 to ∼12 Å measuring molecular displacements. Whereas for the case of donor–acceptor interactions, the PCBM center to donor rings separated by at most 12 Å were evaluated and the distance between fullerene and donor molecule centers (dda) was saved. See Fig. 4(b).

2.9 Total number of contacts
Taking advantage of the routines described above, the total contacts for donor–donor, donor–acceptor and acceptor–acceptor molecules  were calculated for evaporated and annealed phases by counting neighbors around 4.0 Å; these values were normalized to the number of contacts present for maximal donor–donor (and acceptor–acceptor) at an ideal bilayer , and for maximal donor–acceptor contacts for a random homogenous phase .29 These simulations were equlibrated at 300 K (NVT, 800 ps) and at a pressure fixed to 1 bar into an isotropic scheme (NPT, 200 ps) followed by 40 ns of NPT production. All systems were generated using Packmol package49 version 16.344 (more information in the ESI† and Fig. S6).
3 Results and discussion
The packing morphologies will affect the BHJ efficiency by changing the electronic levels (frontier orbitals and corresponding gap) and by favoring energy and charge transfer due to the molecular vicinity, i. e. molecular distance, aggregate index, number of contacts, and alignments (angles, π–π stacking). Parameters for these quantities are extracted from the results of MD simulations and presented below.
3.1 Rotatable bond parameterization
The method mentioned in Subsection 2.2 was applied to all molecules considered. In general, parameterized GAFF results are in good agreement with rotational barriers calculated by QM-DFT, except for double-fused aromatic rings, which introduced fitting complications, limiting the precision to about ∼2.5 kcal mol−1 (see Fig. S3, ESI†). Although the charge parameterization could affect the fitted rotatable barrier, H-Iter has been implemented successfully along with GAFF in MD systems, requiring only minimal fitting.50 The nature of this issue is probably the orbital interactions (bridges) between two neighboring fused rings that have been reported in other studies,51,52 consequently molecular mechanics fails to reproduce it. Our corrected rotatable bonds will have important effects on the system properties extracted from MD simulations.
3.2 Properties driven by the packing morphology
In the evaporated and annealed simulations, the recalculated HOMO and LUMO levels for donor–donor or acceptor–acceptor adducts do not show significant differences; we present in Table 1 typical values for evaporated phases that show the center and the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the distribution of hundreds of donor–donor adduct pair frontier orbital levels, from which the distribution of the gap is obtained. As expected, the gaps are in the vicinity of the optimal gap values for BHJ cells according to the Scharber model,21i.e. 1.2–1.8 eV for gap and 3.9–4.0 eV for LUMO values. For all systems, acceptor–acceptor adduct pairs gave mean values of −5.74 ± 0.06, −3.94 ± 0.07 and 1.81 ± 0.08 eV for the HOMO, LUMO, and gap, respectively, in good agreement with recent measurements.13 Detailed results for annealed donor–donor and for evaporated and annealed acceptor–acceptor frontier orbital values are reported in the ESI† (Tables S1 and S2).

In addition, we simulated polymer and oligomer donors which have also been measured experimentally, namely P3HT (simulated through model 4-3HT) and o-BDTdFBT. Firstly, the calculated values of the frontier orbital levels are in good agreement with experiments.8,13 Secondly, the experimental evidence concurs with our simulations, showing no changes in the electronic properties between evaporation or annealing treatments.13,53
The changes in orbitals seemed to correspond to the heights of the rotational barriers between monomers (see Fig. S3, ESI†), for instance for systems 4-T vs. 4-3HT and C271 vs. C271-chains as shown for the LUMO and gap values in Table 1. Rotations of C271 monomers are more restricted than 4-T, which presents a clear energy difference in its LUMO orbitals when hexyl groups are added (4-3HT). Thus, the free side chains in 4-3HT can displace both the dihedral angles and orbital energy values. Additionally, we noticed that the larger FWHM of the HOMO and LUMO values in 4-3HT is promoted by the existence of multiple conformations.
It should be noted that the best HOMO–LUMO gap among all proposed donors was achieved by the C169 molecule with a value of 1.74 eV, which outpaced even the reference molecule o-BDTdFBT (1.85 eV). Furthermore, because the C169 HOMO is lower than the corresponding o-BDTdFBT HOMO, a higher C169 VOC can be anticipated due to a larger HOMODD–LUMOAA difference.
However, to calculate VOC we decided to take frontier orbitals that belong to donor–acceptor adducts, since this molecular arrangement is involved in the charge-transfer state and the emission of this state (ECT) is used to determine VOC.45,46 The averages for the HOMODA and LUMODA orbitals showed shifted values (see Table 2) compared to HOMODD and LUMOAA, which came from donor–donor and acceptor–acceptor pairs, respectively. The theoretical VOC values calculated for the systems with new donors were predicted better than the 4-3HT and o-BDTFBT systems, while changes after annealing treatment could be observed remarkably in the 4-3HT system.

Aromatic ring stacking is associated with exciton and hole transport and this ordered state affects JSC positively.54 We studied this ring interaction using our ddd and θdd order parameters described in Section 2.8 and reported in Table 3. Results for 4-T and 4-3HT, which only differ by the presence of aliphatic chains, present changes in θdd and show how the π–π stacking decreases while its fluctuation increases, indicating a possible loss of exciton and hole transfer; interestingly, after the annealing process, angle θdd is decreased, thus contributing to better exciton and hole transfer, as has been found for annealed devices prepared with P3HT/PCBM BHJs.55

For molecules C271 and C271 with side chains, the aromatic rings have smaller angles, which increase stacking independently of the presence of side chains. C271-5HPy stacking is further increased by annealing (see also Fig. 4). Large values of ddd suggest that stacking between molecules has been shifted or distorted. Also, donor molecules can be connected by aromatic rings located in their extremes. For instance the longest distance ddd was observed in the o-BDTdFBT donor–donor molecules, however, fluctuations of θdd and increments after thermal annealing would lead to efficiency losses due to poor hole transfer. On this, the proposed new donors gave better π–π stacking values, predicting better molecular arrangements.
For the donor–acceptor packing morphology, large values of dda indicate interactions between fullerene rings and aromatic rings located at the tip of donor molecules, while large values of θda indicate edge-on interactions between donor rings and the fullerene acceptor; this has been associated with more efficient charge separation due to smaller electronic coupling between the charge transfer states and the ground state, lowering the activation energy for charge generation.56 The best combined values for ddd, dda, θdd and θda occur for molecule C271-5HPy, resulting in good donor–donor stacking at the same time as good interactions with the fullerene surface even after thermal annealing (see Fig. 4(b)).
Molecular nearest neighbors (defined in Section 2.6) were calculated for any kind of neighboring molecules, donor–donor, donor–acceptor, acceptor–donor, and acceptor–acceptor molecules. Fig. 5(a)–(c) illustrates the differences between the C271-side chain systems for all MNN types (total χshelltotal(r) and particular pairs χshellij(r)). For all systems, the first peak integral was evaluated via Simpson's rule, showing the number of first neighbor molecules (Table 4). As expected, side chain inclusion in the studied donors can be identified through these quantitative values, but this effect is more evident for the individual components χshellDD(r), χshellDA(r) and χshellAD(r), influencing χshelltotal(r) changes.

The first peaks of χshell(r) were integrated by Simpson's rule to calculate the number of nearest neighbors.

For donor molecules 4-T, C169, C271 and C306, changes in the backbone structure and their effect after thermal annealing were difficult to interpret, because porosity and aggregation of acceptor–acceptor or donor–donor phases are present. However, the aggregation indexes proposed in this work overcome this issue (see below).
Phase separation and aggregation were assessed by measuring the aggregation index (INDD and INAA) and evaluating the largest aggregate index (NmaxDD and NmaxAA), as defined in Subsection 2.7. Small values of INDD and INAA correlate with a small number of aggregates, and therefore with interconnected molecules (porosity in a compact phase). Contrarily, small values of NmaxDD correspond to isolated donor–donor regions. Aggregation indexes for all systems are reported in Table 5.
Table 5 Indexes to evaluate phase aggregation and the largest aggregate of donor–donor (INDD, NmaxDD) and acceptor–acceptor (INAA, NmaxAA) molecules. The number of aggregates and number of molecules within the largest aggregate were normalized by dividing by the total number of donor or acceptor molecules, respectively

For our new donors (C169, C271 and C306) and our reference donor 4-T systems, after evaporation, donor–donor aggregation consists of mainly a single large and interconnected aggregate (INDD = 0.02) that contains most of the donor molecules (NmaxDD ∼ 0.99), while acceptor–acceptor aggregates are more numerous and the largest contains fewer molecules. Thermal annealing does not change significantly the situation for donor–donor aggregates, but modifies significantly the number and size of acceptor–acceptor aggregates (increasing the number INDD and decreasing the maximum size NmaxDD for C306, given mixed phases with donors diluting acceptors, while decreasing the number and increasing the maximum size for C169, promoting phase segregation). This behavior changes drastically when side chains are present. C271 with side chains and o-BDTdFBT, after evaporation, have numerous donor–donor aggregates and the number of molecules in the largest one is moderate (the phase separation is balanced), but after annealing, the number of molecules in the largest aggregate increases significantly. The case of side chains in C271-4HPy merits further comment. The side-chains, in this case, are perpendicular to the ones present in other C271 variants. And their effect is distinctively different as the aggregation also consists of mainly a single large aggregate (none considerably change after annealing), similar to our C271 system.
The aggregation and phase separation tendencies of our nanomorphologies can guide the growth of aggregates to domains in the mesoscale simulations, seeking moderate, continuous and well-connected phase separation, as that is ideal to obtain better exciton diffusion and charge transport properties.

Fig. 6(a)–(c) show the evolution of the normalized total contacts (see Section 2.9) in the evaporation and annealing (heating and cooling) stages for the reference systems including donors o-BDTdFTB (a), 4-T (b) and 4-3HT (c). In the heating process, the contacts are more disperse due to system expansion. After annealing (cooling), decrements of donor–acceptor contacts were observed in both 4-T and 4-3HT, while increments of donor–donor and acceptor–acceptor contacts took place; this was a consequence of phase aggregation, which seemed to be independent of side chains in the thiophenes. This aggregation could be measured by the aggregation indexes mentioned above. The donor–donor contacts in the 4-3HT system fluctuated more than the same in the 4-T system, due to deviations promoted by side chains. Contrarily, for o-BDTdFBT, only the donor–donor phase aggregation was visible. Table 6 collects results for all simulations including standard deviations. Interestingly, the proposed new donors showed increments of donor–acceptor contacts after thermal treatment in opposition to 4-T and 4-3HT, thus leading to disaggregation of phases, specifically in the acceptor–acceptor phase as shown by the total contacts (see Table 6), in agreement with the calculated acceptor–acceptor aggregate indexes.

4 Summary and conclusions
Molecular dynamics simulations were employed to analyze the morphological packing of heterojunctions of donor–acceptor phases present in OPVs after both evaporation and annealing processes. The properties affected by the arrangements and packing were studied, including frontier orbitals, π−π molecular stacking, molecular coordination (through distances and angles), regions for molecular aggregation and the influence of lateral aliphatic chains on these donors.
Results from rotatable bonds revealed that adding side chains leads to planarity modifications in 4-3HT. This may lead to losses in efficiency due to the influence of ring stacking on charge transport. The best choice for donors would be higher rotational barriers that impede rotations, such as in the case of C271-5HPy. Also, results for molecular stacking and displacements can be used for applications in realistic charge transport models. Likewise, the interaction angles between donor and acceptor molecules can be used for the corresponding charge separation models.
Molecular distribution functions (eqn (2) and (3)) were proposed to quantify coordination numbers and to define aggregated regions, allowing us to quantitatively evaluate molecular coordination in simulated heterojunctions, because addition of aliphatic lateral chains to donors affects the acceptor–acceptor phase.
Linear regression from normalized histograms provided a good description of frontier orbitals from theoretical calculations, predicting that the C169 donor has the best gapDD for solar energy absorption, and thus a better VOC than that of the 4-3HT polymer or o-BDTdFBT oligomer. Calculations for HOMO and LUMO energies that belong to donor–donor or acceptor–acceptor showed no change between evaporated and annealing phases, in agreement with experimental data, while the frontier orbitals of donor–acceptor adducts changed energy values with the annealing treatment in some cases. That has, to the best of our knowledge, not been theoretically reported before, and then our proposed parameters in this work will be further analyzed to lead to optimization of the BHJ seeking a better PCE.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Electron donor structures blended with PCBM. Molecule labels are colored in blue for scaffolds that come from H-CEPDB, in green for C271-derivative structures, where side chains were added, and red for reference donor structures including 4-T and 4-3HT (representing polymer P3HT) and oligomer o-BDTdFBT.	 
	(1)

 	Fig. 2  Normalized histogram of HOMODD (green), LUMODD (blue) and gapDD (red) for 4-3HT, o-BDTdFBT and C169 molecular pairs, representing corrections by a linear regression (Δ1) model and the oligomer length (Δ2). Δ2 was applied before shift Δ1 in 4-3HT.	 
	(2)
	(3)

 	Fig. 3  Molecular regions used to define partial and total molecular distribution functions. The red region corresponds to a shell between r and r + Δr. The red molecule is inside that shell and is discarded from the blue shell. The blue molecule belongs to the blue shell. The black molecule is outside the shells shown in this figure.	 
	(4)
	(5)

 	Fig. 4  Interaction distances and angles for molecular pairs donor–donor and donor–acceptor (a). Results of donor–donor pair analysis (red) and donor–acceptor pairs (blue) for the C271-5HPy system after the thermal annealing process (b). Note that angles were normalized between 0 and 90 degrees.
