    , Accepted 23rd May 2021First published on 28th May 2021AbstractIn the development of bifacial dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), the exploration of cost-beneficial transparent counter electrodes is a permanent target. Herein, we put forward a simple one-step strategy to load PW11Co polyoxometalates on graphene-like Co0.85Se (abbreviated as PW11Co-n/Co0.85Se, where n represents the concentration of PW11Co) by in situ synthesis on conductive glass substrates. Powder X-ray diffraction, IR spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electron microscopy techniques prove that PW11Co nanoparticles have been dispersedly deposited on Co0.85Se. The obtained PW11Co/Co0.85Se composite counter electrode (CE) material maintains excellent transparency and efficient electrocatalytic triiodide reduction performance. As a consequence, the optimized front and back efficiencies of DSSCs based on the transparent PW11Co-0.5/Co0.85Se CE could reach 7.56% and 5.82%, respectively, which are higher than those of the Pt CE (5.89% and 4.47%) and pure Co0.85Se CE (6.45% and 5.33%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that polyoxometalates have been used in bifacial DSSCs. Mechanism research shows that polyoxometalates as electron aggregates can improve the charge transfer ability of selenide to the I−/I3− redox pair as well as accelerate the reduction of I3−. The present work not only offers a valuable way to design composites for electrocatalytic triiodide reduction, but also expands the application fields of polyoxometalates toward bifacial photoelectronic devices.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), which can directly convert solar energy into electricity without emissions, have attracted a lot of attention because of their advantages such as low cost, simple production process and environmental friendliness.1–4 The first archetype was established by O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991.5 Recently, DSSCs have achieved 14.3% high PCE and reached commercial standards.6 Classical DSSCs are a sandwich structure consisting of a TiO2 photoanode, an electrolyte and a counter electrode (CE).7 To date, Pt has been considered to be the best catalyst for effectively reducing I3− to I−.8 Nonetheless, Pt is a precious metal with low abundance and high cost, which hinder the large-scale preparation of DSSCs.9 In addition, platinum is easy to be oxidized and dissolved when it works in an I3−/I− electrolyte for a long time; this process will lead to performance degradation.10,11 Therefore, to reduce the cost and to maintain the performance of DSSCs, we need to make efforts to develop platinum substitutes.
Although many researchers have devoted themselves to the development of Pt-free CEs, such as conductive polymers12,13 and carbonaceous materials,14,15 their electrocatalytic activity and stability are unsatisfactory.16 Furthermore, inorganic compounds such as metal nitrides, sulfides and carbides are considered to be high-efficiency and low-cost photoelectric materials,17,18 but their power conversion efficiency is unsatisfactory when used in DSSC devices. Recently, Grätzel et al. put forward a burgeoning concept of bifacial lighting.19 Such related bifacial DSSCs can collect sunlight from both sides of the device and this helps to reduce the cost of photoelectric conversion. Regardless of transparent carbon materials,20 conductive polymers,21 metal sulfides22 or metal Pt23 CEs, bifacial DSSCs are always troubled by low rear efficiency and stability. Therefore, transparency, or at least translucency, seems to be crucial for CEs to realize high-efficiency rear lighting. At this level, metal selenides, especially cobalt selenide (Co0.85Se),24,25 are expected to produce efficient and stable bifacial DSSCs on account of their unique platinum-like electronic configuration, excellent optical transparency, low cost and tolerable electrocatalytic activity. To date, cobalt selenides featuring diverse morphologies (e.g., nanorods,26 nanobelt,27 petal-like nanosheets,28 and hollow nanoparticles29) have been discovered and efficiently evaluated in bifacial DSSCs with accessible triiodide reduction activity. Remarkably, it is found that the pioneering example of DSSCs based upon Co0.85Se CEs with considerable power conversion efficiency relies on their unique two-dimensional graphene-like morphology.24 Accordingly, such 2D layer structures may offer not only the requirements of large surface area but also acceptable conductive substrates for loading suitable nanoscale species for enhanced performance in bifacial DSSCs. However, the concerned research is scarcely explored.
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are a type of well-known polynuclear nano-size metal-oxo cluster with definite structures and comprehensive properties.30,31 They have the advantages of tuned molecular design and sizes, good thermal stabilities and solubility, low cost and mild preparation conditions, which make such nanoscale clusters to be regarded as “guest” species to be combined with various 2D materials (for instance, MoS2,32 graphene33 and carbon nitride polymers34) to give rise to composite materials with target functionalities, especially POM-based transparent composite films.35,36 In addition, previous studies proved that Co-containing POMs have excellent redox characteristics without changing their structures and can be used in CEs to reduce I3− to I−.37 Thus, the composite materials composed of both graphene-like Co0.85Se and POMs served as Pt-free CEs resulting in high-efficiency bifacial DSSCs. However, the related combination has not been discovered so far. Herein, we put forward a simple one-step strategy to dispersedly load polyoxometalates (POMs) on graphene-like Co0.85Se (abbreviated as POMs/Co0.85Se) by in situ synthesis on FTO. POMs can act as a bridge for electron transfer, and increase the conductivity and catalytic performance of Co0.85Se without changing the transparency. As far as we know, this is the first time that POMs are used in bifacial CEs. When transparent PW11Co/Co0.85Se is used as the CE of bifacial DSSCs, the incident light can easily penetrate the CE and then excite the dye, which significantly improves the rear efficiency and reduces the solar energy conversion cost. When PW11Co-0.5/Co0.85Se is used as the CE of a bifacial DSSC, the front and back efficiencies are 7.56% and 5.82%, respectively, which are higher than those of the Pt CE (5.89% and 4.47%) and pure Co0.85Se CE (6.45% and 5.33%).
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis and characterization of PW11Co/Co0.85Se
We successfully loaded PW11Co onto graphene-like Co0.85Se by in situ growth on a clean FTO glass substrate through a hydrothermal reaction (see the Experimental section). IR spectra of PW11Co, Co0.85Se and PW11Co/Co0.85Se are shown in Fig. 1a. The IR spectrum of PW11Co shows four characteristic peaks from 700 cm−1 to 1100 cm−1, and νas(P–Oa), νas(WOd), νas(W–Ob–W) and νas(W–Oc–W) observed at 1048 cm−1, 951 cm−1, 888 cm−1 and 828 cm−1, respectively.38 In the PW11Co/Co0.85Se composite, four characteristic peaks of PW11Co appeared at the corresponding positions, which indicated that PW11Co was successfully loaded on Co0.85Se without changing its structure. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern in Fig. 1b shows that the diffraction peaks of pure Co0.85Se are 33.23°, 44.85°, 50.44°, 60.24°, 61.75° and 69.77°, which can be assigned to the (101), (102), (110), (103), (201) and (202) plane tips of the following planes Crystal type Co0.85Se (JCPDS:52-1008).24 These characteristic peaks of Co0.85Se and PW11Co both appear in the corresponding positions of the PW11Co/Co0.85Se composite material, which strongly proves that the PW11Co nanoparticles have been successfully loaded onto Co0.85Se. The light transmission spectrum of Fig. 1c shows that the optical transparency of Co0.85Se loaded with POMs is almost unchanged (>85% in visible light region) compared with the pure Co0.85Se, which provides more opportunities for its practical applications, such as roofs, automobile windshields and other decorations. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of PW11Co/Co0.85Se confirmed that the composites are composed of Co, Se, W, P and O elements (Fig. 1d).

For detailed discussions, Fig. 2 shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of Co 2p and Se 3d in PW11Co/Co0.85Se and pure Co0.85Se. The Co 2p (Fig. 2c) and Se 3d (Fig. 2d) signals of PW11Co/Co0.85Se are centered on the binding energies of 781.54 eV, 786.50, 797.70 eV, and 803.5 eV and 54.30 eV, 59.10 eV, and 62.11 eV, respectively. As for pure Co0.85Se, Co 2p (Fig. 2a) and Se 3d (Fig. 2b) signals are detected, and the binding energies were 781.35 eV, 785.80, 797.5 eV, and 803.3 eV and 54.2 eV, 59.01, and 61.84 eV.39,40 Obviously, the change of binding energy indicates that there are interactions and electron transfer between PW11Co and Co0.85Se, which is attributed to the successfully loading of POM nanoparticles on Co0.85Se layers. Co0.85Se can transfer charges to POMs in terms of the positive shifts in XPS analysis, thus POMs act as electron accumulators to accelerate electron transfers as expected, thereby improving the electrocatalytic activity of 2D graphene-like Co0.85Se layers.

Fig. 3b shows the SEM image of PW11Co/Co0.85Se grown in situ on an FTO substrate. It can be clearly observed that the leaf-shaped PW11Co/Co0.85Se was successfully grown on the FTO substrate.24 The lower the surface coverage, the higher the transparency. Compared with the original Co0.85Se (Fig. 3a), the addition of POMs increased the surface coverage of selenides on FTO, but the transparency of PW11Co/Co0.85Se is almost unchanged (see the illustrations in Fig. 3). Furthermore, the addition of POMs did not change the main structure of selenide; the leaf-shaped PW11Co/Co0.85Se remains rather loose, which is beneficial to accelerate the diffusion of I−/I3− in the electrolyte. The EDX spectrum of PW11Co/Co0.85Se is shown in Fig. S3,† which indicates that PW11Co/Co0.85Se is made up of five elements, namely Co, Se, P, W and O, no other elements are doped. The morphology of PW11Co/Co0.85Se was further characterized by TEM (Fig. 4b and S4†). Fig. 4b shows the low resolution transmission electron microscopy (LRTEM) images of PW11Co/Co0. 85Se, and we can clearly observe that the surface of the graphene-like Co0.85Se is covered with a large number of POM nanoparticles, which are tiny dark spots and relatively dispersed. The pure Co0.85Se for better comparison is shown in Fig. 4a. It can be seen that after POMs are added, selenide still retains its structure similar to graphene. The results are consistent with IR and XRD (Fig. 1). What's more, lattice stripes were clearly observed by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) (Fig. 4c), which indicates that PW11Co/Co0.85Se possesses good crystallinity like Co0.85Se. The interplanar spacings of d101 for PW11Co/Co0.85Se are 2.67 ± 0.1 Å, which are derived from the lattice fringes and similar to the theoretical value of Co0.85Se.24 The element mapping (Fig. 4d) of the PW11Co/Co0.85Se composite material proves that all Co, Se, P, W and O elements are evenly distributed, which further proves that POMs are successfully loaded on graphene-like Co0.85Se.

2.2 Electrochemical measurements of PW11Co/Co0.85Se
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement is used to further study the electrocatalytic activities of various CEs. In Fig. 5a, there are two pairs of redox peaks in each CV curve, which respectively represent the I3− + 2e− = 3I−(1)reaction on the low potential side and the 3I− − 2e− = I3−(2)reaction on the high potential side. The cathode peak current density (JRed) and peak spacing (Epp) between anode and cathode peaks are two significant parameters to appraise the catalytic activity and electron transfer efficiency of different materials.41 A higher JRed value indicates higher catalytic activity for electrode materials, while a smaller Epp value indicates lower overpotential corresponding to the catalytic reaction.42 PW11Co-0.5/Co0.85Se has the largest JRed and the smallest Epp, which indicates that the PW11Co-0.5/Co0.85Se can accelerate electron transfer and possess the uppermost electrocatalytic performance for the reduction of I3−. To some extent, the electrocatalytic activity of selenide is indeed improved by the addition of POMs.
 Fig. 5  (a) CV curves of Pt, Co0.85Se, PW11Co-0.3/Co0.85Se, PW11Co-0.5/Co0.85Se, and PW11Co-0.8/Co0.85Se CEs, (b, c) Tafel polarization curves and Nyquist plot (inset: the equivalent circuit model) of CEs for all electrode materials, and (d) the photocurrent response of DSSCs based on the PW11Co-0.5/Co0.85Se CE. 
In addition, the Tafel polarization curve further explores the electrocatalytic activity of CEs in DSSCs. In Fig. 5b, it is the Tafel polarization curve of all CE materials. Generally, the Tafel curve can be divided into three areas, which are polarization region, Tafel region and diffusion region, respectively.43 The exchange current density (J0) can be obtained from the intersection of equilibrium potential and cathode branch in the Tafel region, the larger J0 indicates that the material has higher catalytic performance. The limiting diffusion current density (Jlim) can be obtained from the intersection of the cathode branch and ordinate. The larger Jlim indicates the faster diffusion speed of I3− in the electrolyte.44 As shown in Fig. 5b, PW11Co-0.5/Co0.85Se has the highest J0 and Jlim, which further proves that it has the uppermost electrocatalytic activity.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is used to explore the process of electron transfer between the electrode interface and electrolyte. In order to further research the electrocatalytic activity of composite materials, EIS experiments were performed by using two identical electrodes to form a symmetrical cell (CE/electrolyte/CE). The intercept on the transverse axis in the high frequency region represents the series resistance (Rs), which is the series resistance between the FTO substrate and the CE material. The left semicircle refers to the charge transfer impedance (Rct) at the electrolyte/electrode interface, and the other semicircle on the right is the diffusion impedance (ZW) of the I3−/I− redox couple transfer in the electrolyte.44Fig. 5c shows the Nyquist diagram of different composite materials. According to the equivalent circuit diagram, all Nyquist diagrams are fitted by Z-view software to obtain Rs, Rct and ZW (Table S1†), and the fitted data are in good agreement with the measured data. The smaller Rct represents the higher the catalytic performance of the composite material for I3− reduction; the smaller the ZW, the greater the migration rate and diffusion coefficient of I−.16 As shown in Fig. 5c, the order of the Rct value is PW11Co-0.8/Co0.85Se > PW11Co-0.3/Co0.85Se > Co0.85Se > PW11Co-0.5/Co0.85Se > Pt. The order of the Rs value is Pt > PW11Co-0.5/Co0.85Se > PW11Co-0.8/Co0.85Se > PW11Co-0.3/Co0.85Se > Co0.85Se. Therefore, the catalytic activity of PW11Co-0.5/Co0.85Se CE is similar to that of Pt CE. The results show that PW11Co-0.5/Co0.85Se possesses relatively good catalytic activity for the reduction of I3−.

Fig. 5d shows the photocurrent response test under AM 1.5 illumination. The photocurrent density suddenly increases when irradiated from the front or back, which indicates that the solar cell starts successfully without delay, and the POM/Co0.85Se electrode is powerful in electron transfer and catalytic I3− reduction.25 In every “start” state, for all batteries with PW11Co/Co0.85Se electrodes, the photocurrent density is retained with no obvious attenuation. Therefore, when the PW11Co/Co0.85Se electrode is used in solar cells, it has good starting ability. In addition, the photocurrent of DSSCs has almost no obvious changes in a certain period of time (Fig. S5†), which indicates that DSSCs have good stability.

Fig. 6a shows the CV measurement of the PW11Co/Co0.85Se CE at different scanning rates. The results show that with the increase of scanning rates, the peak value of oxidation–reduction gradually moves to positive and negative directions respectively. Fig. 6b shows the relationship between Jred and square root of scan rates. It clearly shows that there is a linear relationship between the peak current of the redox peak and the square root of scanning rates, indicating that the reduction of I3− by the PW11Co/Co0.85Se CE is controlled by ion diffusion.

2.3 Characterization of photovoltaic performances of PW11Co/Co0.85Se
We assembled PW11Co/Co0.85Se, Co0.85Se and Pt CEs into DSSCs, and tested their photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves. The J–V curves and related parameters based on PW11Co/Co0.85Se composites and Pt CEs are shown in Fig. 7 and Table 1. The PCE and Jsc values of front illumination produced by the DSSC based on Pt CE are 5.89% and 14.40 mA cm−2, respectively, but the back illumination is reduced to 4.47% and 11.87 mA cm−2, respectively. However, when Pt was replaced by the Co0.85Se CE, the PCE and Jsc were significantly increased to 6.45% and 15.80 mA cm−2 by front irradiation, and 5.33% and 13.26 mA cm−2 by back irradiation, respectively. Therefore, for front lighting, the performance of Co0.85Se is equivalent to that of Pt, but for rear lighting, Co0.85Se is better than Pt because of its good transmittance. Therefore, Co0.85Se has great application prospect in bifacial DSSCs. We added PW11Co with different contents to control the properties of Co0.85Se materials. The transmittance of selenide was not affected by the addition of POMs. Notably, the PCE and Jsc values of the front illumination produced by the DSSC based on the PW11Co-0.5/Co0.85Se CE are 7.56% and 16.03 mA cm−2, respectively, and the back illumination is 5.82% and 13.18 mA cm−2, respectively. However, the photoelectric properties of DSSCs decrease when the POM content increases further. Therefore, the content of POM has a significant effect on the catalytic activity of selenide. The explanation is that excessive POMs may cause aggregation and hinder electron transmission, thus reducing the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs. In addition, we compared PW11Co/Co0.85Se with other CE materials, including Co0.85Se with different structures (nanoparticles, nanotubes), Co0.85Se composites, polymers and some transparent materials (Table S2†). It can be clearly found that PW11Co/Co0.85Se shows better PCE values on the front and back, especially some Pt-based transparent materials, such as Zn-TCPP-Pt,45 Pt-Mo2C46 and PtNP-EMTE.47

When irradiated by light, the photogenerated electrons were produced by N719 dye molecules after absorbing photons, which could be quickly transferred to the external circuit via the conductive band (CB) of TiO2. The PW11Co/Co0.85Se CE collects electrons from external circuits and injects them into the redox electrolyte to reduce I3−, in which Co0.85Se can conduct charges and make electrons enter PW11Co. Redox PW11Co POMs accept electrons from Co0.85Se, and then inject them into the electrolyte to reduce I3−. The efficiency of electron injection into electrolyte affects the performance of DSSCs. The efficiency of electron injection into the electrolyte was evaluated by the energy level difference between the CB of PW11Co/Co0.85Se and the redox potential of the electrolyte (Fig. 8). The larger the energy level difference, the higher the electron injection efficiency. It can be clearly seen that the CB of PW11Co is −4.45 eV (Fig. S13†), the redox potential of electrolyte is −4.90 eV, and the energy level difference between them remains 0.45 eV, which ensures that DSSCs have excellent electron injection efficiency and obtain excellent photovoltaic performance. In addition, the stability of the PW11Co/Co0.85Se CE and related DSSCs was further analyzed. The IR, XRD, optical transmittance spectra, SEM and TEM images (Fig. S5–S7†) of the PW11Co/Co0.85Se CE after the durability tests reveal its satisfactory structural stability. Furthermore, we tested the CV, Tafel, Nyquist curve and the photovoltaic performance of the DSSC based on the PW11Co/Co0.85Se CE at different test times (Fig. S9–S12†), and the results show that they have not changed significantly. Specifically, the front and rear PCE (7.30% and 5.61%) of the DSSC based on the PW11Co/Co0.85Se CE after 9 days is only 3.4% and 3.6% lower than the initial values (7.56% and 5.82%), which shows that the PW11Co-0.5/Co0.85Se CE has excellent long-term stability. Therefore, both the PW11Co/Co0.85Se CE and the related DSSC possess excellent long-term stability.

3. Experimental
3.1 Synthesis and measurements
CoCl2·6H2O, N2H4·H2O (80 wt%) and Se powder were purchased from Aladdin and FTO was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. At room temperature, a Bruker AXS TENSOR-27 FT-IR spectrometer was used to obtain the transform IR spectra in the range of 4000–400 cm−1. XRD measurement was performed on a Rigaku D/max-2550 diffractometer with copper Kα radiation (k = 1.5418). XPS was carried out using a KRATOS, Axis UltraDLD spectrometer with Al Kα radiation. The microstructure and morphology of Co0.85Se and PW11Co/Co0.85Se were characterized using a Hitachi S-4800 SEM and TEM (JEM-2100PLUS). The chemical composition of the material was verified by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) was measured using a CHI601D (Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Corp., P. R. China) electrochemical workstation system under 500 W xenon lamp simulated sunlight. A CHI660D workstation was used to perform cyclic voltammetry, in which the electrolyte was acetonitrile solution composed of 10 mM I2, 50 mM LiI, and 500 mM LiClO4, an Ag/Ag+ electrode was the reference electrode, PW11Co/Co0.85Se was the working electrode, and a platinum wire was the counter electrode. The Tafel polarization curve and EIS measurements were performed on a CS350 electrochemical station.
3.2 Preparation of the POM
[Co(H2O)(PW11O39)]5− (CoPW11) was obtained according to the procedure reported in the literature.38 Na8HPW9O34 (8.69 g, 3.60 mmol)48 was dissolved in 100 mL of distilled water and 1 mL of glacial acetic acid was added. Then Co(OOCCH3)2·4H2O (1.79 g, 6.96 mmol) was added and pH was adjusted to 5 by adding some drops of glacial acetic acid. The solution was kept under reflux at 100 °C during 2 hours and then filtered while still hot. After cooling down to room temperature, CH3COOK was added in excess to precipitate the desired purple solid. The product was filtered and dried at 60 °C.
3.3 Preparation of the CE
0.0095 g of selenium powder and 0.0238 g of CoCl2·6H2O were weighed; then deionized water was added to make the total volume of the solution to be 35 ml. 2.12 ml of hydrazine hydrate (80% by weight) was added to the above solution while stirring. Then, the mixture was stirred vigorously for 10 minutes. PW11Co solutions with different concentrations (0, 0.3, 0.5 or 0.8 mg mL−1) were added into the above reaction system, respectively. CEs with different POMs contents were named Co0.85Se, PW11Co-0.3/Co0.85Se, PW11Co-0.5/Co0.85Se and PW11Co-0.8/Co0.85Se, respectively. The reactants were transferred to a 50 ml Teflon lined autoclave, and a clean FTO glass substrate (purchased from Advanced Election Technology Co., Ltd) was immersed in it with the conductive layer facing down. The reaction was continued at 120 °C for 12 hours, cooling to room temperature, rinsing FTO substrate with deionized water 5 times, and drying at 50 °C.
3.4 Assembly of DSSCs
The photoanode and redox electrolyte were prepared according to the literature.49,50 The I3−/I− redox electrolyte was injected between the PW11Co/Co0.85Se CE and the dye-sensitized TiO2 anode to form a sandwich structure, thus forming DSSCs.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we successfully loaded PW11Co POMs on graphene-like Co0.85Se by in situ synthesis on conductive glass substrates at low temperature, and used the PW11Co/Co0.85Se composite as a transparent CE in bifacial DSSCs without any post-treatment. The effect of the PW11Co content on the electrocatalytic performance of selenides was studied. Cyclic voltammetry and Tafel and Nyquist tests confirmed that PW11Co/Co0.85Se possesses excellent electrocatalytic performance. Under simulated sunlight, the front and back efficiencies of bifacial DSSCs based on the PW11Co-0.5/Co0.85Se CE are 7.56% and 5.82%, which are higher than those of Pt CE (5.89% and 4.47%) and pure Co0.85Se CE (6.45% and 5.33%). The present work not only offers a valuable way to design composites for electrocatalytic triiodide reduction, but also expands the application fields of POMs toward bifacial photoelectronic devices.
