    , Accepted 22nd March 2018First published on 24th March 2018AbstractWe adopted a ternary copolymerization strategy to construct a series of D–A1–D–A2 random polymers (P2FBT-25, P2FBT-50 and P2FBT-75), utilizing difluorinated benzothiadiazole (2FBT) and alkoxy substituted benzothiadiazole (2ORBT) as complementary acceptor units and thienyl-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) as the donor unit.

The optimal ratio of 75:25 between 2FBT and 2ORBT in the random terpolymers enhanced the efficiency of the P2FBT-75:PC71BM blend via a CHCl3 solution vapor annealing approach, exhibiting an efficiency of 5.72% due to improved light absorption and balanced charge transport. Moreover, an efficiency of over 5.60% can be obtained with an active layer thickness of 100–170 nm, and the PCE of over 4.52% was observed even though the thickness was around 270 nm. Noticeably, the three random copolymers that differ considerably in composition, all afford high PCEs (5.00% for P2FBT-25, 4.40% for P2FBT-50, and 5.72% for P2FBT-75), suggesting that high performance materials can be developed within a reasonable composition range via random copolymerization.
1 Introduction
In recent years, polymer solar cells (PSCs) with a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) structure have been considered to be one of the most promising candidates for next generation energy sources because of their lightweight, flexibility, and low cost.1–4 A great number of research efforts have been focused on power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs exceeding 12% in single-junction and multi-junction devices, in which the photoactive layer consists of narrow band gap π-conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives.5–10 The conjugated polymers with alternative donor–acceptor (D–A) structures have become the most popular and successful strategy to develop high-performance photovoltaic PSCs.11–15 The band-gap (Eg) as well as the molecular energy levels and optical properties of the D–A polymers can be effectively tuned by rational selection and optimization of the electron-rich donor (D) unit and the electron-deficient acceptor (A) unit.16,17 In most cases, low-band-gap polymers achieved by the D–A approach do not show broad absorption, but instead absorption maxima are red-shifted, decreasing the number of absorbed photons in the visible region and ultimately limiting the achievable photocurrent. One promising approach toward broadening the absorption of the solar spectrum is to develop random terpolymers based on the copolymerization of two different D units and one A unit or one A unit and two different D units.18,19 The combination of multiple different conjugated units into one polymer backbone and the easy adjustment of their composition ratios would be a low-cost and fast synthetic route to develop high performance polymers.20–22
Among D–A polymers, those with a benzothiadiazole (BT) acceptor moiety, particularly difluorinated derivatives (2FBT) have attracted much attention recently as they have shown promising performance characteristics in PSCs.8,23–34 And the interesting and widely employed donor moiety for D–A polymer semiconductors is benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT).20,26,35–39 Notable interesting properties of the BDT donor unit for D–A polymer design include extended π-conjugation, and tunable solubility characteristics as well as the ability to impart coplanarity to the backbone structure, owing to its chemical and electronic tunability, which allows substitution of the 2′ and 6′ positions with aliphatic or aromatic substituents. As is well-known, a D–A-type copolymer of BDT and 2FBT exhibits high photovoltaic properties in PSCs. For instance, the D–A1–D–A2 random copolymers containing BDT and 2FBT, Th25 and Th35, synthesized by Duan et al., exhibited impressive efficiencies of about 8.0% with little batch-to-batch variation.20
Accordingly, to demonstrate the potential of random copolymers we use the two attractive units (BDT and 2FBT) in a copolymer with alkoxy-substituted BT (2ORBT) as another acceptor unit, as shown in Scheme 1. The ratio between 2FBT and 2ORBT is varied from 1:3 to 1:1 to 3:1 in the polymer backbones. The introduction of two alkoxy chains into BT not only enhances solubility but also contributes to film formation.40 Therefore, the combination of these two attractive units and 2ORBT is expected to enhance interchain interaction and thus obtain high device performance. Three new conjugated random copolymers P2FBT-25, P2FBT-50 and P2FBT-75 show complementary and broad light absorption and high carrier mobility. The best PCE value of 5.72% was obtained from the blend device of P2FBT-75:PC71BM using CHCl3 solution vapor annealing (SVA) for 30 s, with a high open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.89 V and a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 11.39 mA cm−2, which were attributed to the broad absorption and the balanced hole and electron mobilities. Noticeably, the three random copolymers, P2FBT-25, P2FBT-50 and P2FBT-75, which differ considerably in composition, all afford high PCEs, suggesting that high performance materials can be developed within a reasonable composition range via random copolymerization. Moreover, PCEs of P2FBT-75:PC71BM blend PSCs over 5.60% can be obtained at a thickness range of 100–170 nm, and the PCE of over 4.52% was observed even though the BHJ thickness was around 270 nm, suggesting that this material is potentially suitable for the manufacture of large area PSC devices.

2 Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis and thermal properties

Scheme 1 shows the synthesis of random terpolymers with different feed molar ratios of 2FBT to 2ORBT (2FBT:2ORBT = 0.25:0.75 for P2FBT-25; 0.50:0.50 for P2FBT-50; 0.75:0.25 for P2FBT-75). The polymers were synthesized by carrying out Stille coupling reactions in a chlorobenzene solvent with Pd2dba3/P(o-tolyl)3 as the catalyst. After carrying out the reaction, the polymers were collected by precipitation in methanol and purified by performing successive Soxhlet extractions with methanol, hexane, acetone, and CHCl3 to remove the byproducts and oligomers. Detailed descriptions of the syntheses and characterizations of polymers are provided in the Experimental section. To ensure good solubility of all copolymers, 2-ethylhexylthiophene groups were positioned on the BDT unit and two dodecyloxy chains were substituted on the BT unit, respectively. Three terpolymers showed good solubility in common organic solvents including CHCl3, THF, chlorobenzene, and 1,2-dichlorobenzene. Gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) was employed to determine the number-average molecular weight (Mn), weight-average molecular weight (Mw), and polydispersity index (PDI) in THF solution relative to polystyrene standard. P2FBT-25, P2FBT-50, and P2FBT-75 revealed the high Mn values of 42.2, 53.2, and 56.3 kDa, respectively, with a narrow PDI of 1.98–2.22. The high molecular weight in these polymers is beneficial for realizing higher performance organic electronic devices. The thermal stability of the terpolymers was analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. As shown in Fig. 1, the onset temperature with 5% weight loss was about 309 °C for P2FBT-25, 329 °C for P2FBT-50, and 360 °C for P2FBT-75, respectively. Thus, the thermal stability of the polymers improved as the molecular weight increased. All of the terpolymers exhibited excellent thermal stability, indicating that these polymers are suitable for fabricating organic optoelectronic devices.

2.2 Optical properties
The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the polymers in dilute CHCl3 solution and the thin films spin-coated on a glass substrate are given in Fig. 2 and the relevant data are listed in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2a, all the random terpolymers exhibited multiple and broad absorption bands ranging from 300 to 750 nm, a common feature of polymers based on donor and acceptor units. We can see in Fig. 2a that in dilute solution, the main absorption band of terpolymers is gradually red-shifted and broadened to some extent with the ratio increase of the 2FBT component. In dilute CHCl3 solution, for the P2FBT-75 polymer, the absorption peak is located at 651 nm, which is 14 nm longer than that of P2FBT-25 and 11 nm longer than that of P2FBT-50, respectively. All of the terpolymers in thin films display a small red-shift (∼5 nm) in the absorption onsets compared to those in solution (Fig. 2), suggesting higher molecular orders in the solid state. P2FBT-75 exhibits a relatively high absorption intensity with the maximum absorption coefficient of 7.68 × 104 cm−1 at 670 nm, illustrating that the introduction of 2FBT can simultaneously lead to broadened absorption and the increased extinction coefficient. One notes that the absorption band in the low-energy region from 420 to 700 nm is gradually enhanced with the increased content of 2FBT, indicating that 2FBT has significant contribution for light harvesting in these blend films (Fig. 2b). The optical band gaps (Eoptg) of P2FBT-25, P2FBT-50 and P2FBT-75 can be calculated as 1.75, 1.73 and 1.73 eV, respectively, from their onset absorption of the thin films. For P2FBT-75 the maximum absorption profile remains the same as that in solution, but in the case of P2FBT-25 and P2FBT-50 the maximum absorption peaks appeared in the film at a short wavelength. This suggests that P2FBT-75 adopts similar configuration both in solution and in the film while P2FBT-25 and P2FBT-50 have a more twisted conformation than P2FBT-75, which can be due to the stronger steric repulsion effect of more dodecyloxy chains in the aggregate state.41 As mentioned above, by varying the molar ratio of 2FBT and 2ORBT, the absorption range and relative absorption intensity of the polymers could be tailored.

2.3 Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed to investigate the electrochemical properties of the three polymers (Fig. 3a). From the onset oxidation potentials (Eoxon) and the onset reduction potentials (Eredon) of the polymers, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels as well as the energy gaps of the polymers were calculated using a ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple as an external standard (4.80 eV below the vacuum level). The HOMO and LUMO levels were −5.41/−3.33 eV for P2FBT-25, −5.23/−3.31 eV for P2FBT-50, and −5.31/−3.41 eV for P2FBT-75, respectively, according to the following equation: EHOMO = −e(Eoxon + 4.41) (eV) and ELUMO = −e(Eredon + 4.41) (eV) (the redox potential of Fc/Fc+ was 0.39 V vs. saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE) in our measurement system). The energy levels of the polymers reveal that the differences in both HOMO and LUMO levels between different terpolymers are moderate (<0.18 eV) (Table 1). Considering the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, all polymers have enough driving force for efficient exciton dissociation with fullerene derivatives and they are all stable in air (Fig. 3b). The electrochemical band gaps (ECVg) were slightly larger than the corresponding optical band gaps (Eoptg) in all polymers because of the states measured in the electrochemical experiments (free ions), and the optical results (neutral states) were somewhat different (Table 2), which was in agreement with the reported results on other polymer systems.18,19,42

2.4 Photovoltaic properties
In order to examine the photovoltaic properties of these polymers, the BHJ-PSC devices were fabricated with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/terpolymer:PC71BM/LiF/Al and characterized under a simulated AM 1.5G illumination of 100 mW cm−2. By varying the terpolymer/PC71BM ratio in a broad range, an optimal weight ratio between the terpolymer and PC71BM was obtained as 1:1.5 for three terpolymers, and the relevant optimization results are shown in Fig. S1–S6 and Tables S1–S6 (ESI†). To optimize the morphology and ordering structure, different volume percentages of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) were added and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table S7 (ESI†). The optimized thicknesses of the active layers were determined to be 80–120 nm. Fig. 4a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves for the optimal devices with 1% DIO, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters, including the Jsc, Voc, fill factor (FF), and PCE of each device, are summarized in Table 2. All of the devices based on these random terpolymers exhibited the same Voc of 0.89 V, although the HOMO energy levels of terpolymers are different. Voc is proportional to the energy level difference between the HOMO of the conjugated polymer and the LUMO of the fullerene, and thus a deeper HOMO level polymer is crucial to obtain higher Voc. However, Voc is also dependent on factors such as charge recombination and morphology.20 The PCE of the random terpolymers showed the nonlinear compositional dependence from 4.21% to 5.13% in the order P2FBT-75 (5.13%) > P2FBT-25 (4.60%) > P2FBT-50 (4.21%); this was consistent with the observed trend of Jsc. Among all polymers, P2FBT-75 exhibited the highest PCE value of 5.13% with a Voc of 0.89 V, a Jsc of 10.74 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.53. To further improve the performance, solvent vapor annealing (SVA) was applied to the active layer before electrode deposition.43–45 PCEs versus different CHCl3 vapor annealing time (s) of the optimal PSC devices based on the P2FBT-75:PC71BM system was also investigated (see Fig. S7, ESI†). The overall performance of the devices from all of the terpolymer donor materials was enhanced when using CHCl3 vapor annealing treatment for the proper time treatment (30 s) as a result of the enhancement of Jsc (Fig. 4a and Table 2). The Jsc values for devices based on the terpolymer P2FBT-75 were significantly increased in comparison with those of the corresponding binary polymers, even with similar band gaps.20,46,47 Notably, a Jsc as high as 11.39 mA cm−2 was obtained for devices based on P2FBT-75 and PC71BM. The best performance device based on the P2FBT-75:PC71BM blend system with SVA treatment presented the highest PCE of 5.72% (average PCE = 5.33%), with a Voc of 0.89 V, a Jsc of 11.39 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.56, which exhibited a successful enhancement of PCE in comparison with its initial performance before CHCl3 vapor annealing. And the PCEs of the devices with SVA treatment were enhanced to some extent (4.60% vs. 5.00% for P2FBT-25:PC71BM, 4.21% vs. 4.40% for P2FBT-50:PC71BM) after CHCl3 vapor annealing for 30 s due to a slight enhancement of Jsc. Moreover, the terpolymer P2FBT-75 exhibited a much higher PCE than those of its parent polymers Th00 and P2 (PCE = 4.9% and 0.43% for the polymers Th00 and P2, respectively), which may be ascribed to the obviously higher Jsc.20,47 Noticeably, the three random copolymers, P2FBT-25, P2FBT-50 and P2FBT-75, which differ considerably in composition, all afford high PCEs, suggesting that high performance materials can be developed within a reasonable composition range via random copolymerization.
 Fig. 4  
J–V (a) and EQE (b) curves of the optimal PSC devices based on terpolymers:PC71BM with and without CHCl3 vapor annealing. 
To further understand the optimal device performance of PSCs, the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of these devices under their corresponding optimal conditions without and with CHCl3 solvent annealing are shown in Fig. 4b. All the EQE spectra covered a broad wavelength range from 300 to 750 nm for the photovoltaic devices based on these random terpolymer materials and the conversion of photons to electrons was significantly improved in the entire photoactive region after exposure to CHCl3 vapor. P2FBT-75 provided the highest EQEs while P2FBT-25 provided relatively higher EQEs than P2FBT-50 either in as-cast devices or in CHCl3 SVA-treated devices, which was consistent with the increase in Jsc. The EQE value of the PSC device based on P2FBT-75 upon CHCl3 vapor treatment remained above 50% in the range of 350–680 nm with a maximum EQE of 60% at 650 nm, indicating that a highly efficient photoelectron conversion was archived in the devices after post-annealing treatment. Moreover, the calculated Jsc values obtained by integration of the EQE data for these optimal devices showed a minor mismatch (2–5%) with Jsc from the J–V measurements (see Table 2). We also further tried to examine the effect of other organic solution vapors (such as CHCl2 or THF) on device performances. However, neither CHCl2 nor THF vapor annealing processes resulted in enhanced PCEs which contributed to the significant decrease of Jsc and FF compared to CHCl3 vapor annealing (see Table S8, ESI†). For example, PCEs of devices from the P2FBT-75:PC71BM blend after CHCl2 vapor annealing and after THF vapor annealing were 4.81% and 2.74%, respectively.
The donor photon energy loss is defined as Eg − eVoc, where Eg is the optical band gap of the donor polymer and Voc is obtained from the corresponding solar cell device with either PC61BM or PC71BM. Here, the Eg − eVoc values of these random terpolymers are all the same (Table 3), which are close to other efficient PSC materials. It implies that these random terpolymers can help the polymer to show good photovoltaic performance in polymer analogs with the same backbone within a reasonable composition range.

To further investigate the photovoltaic properties, a careful study of charge transporting, morphological and photophysical properties was carried out. We started our analysis by investigating the charge transport properties of the terpolymer:PC71BM blend films via the solvent vapor annealing procedure utilizing the space charge limited current (SCLC) model.48 For each system, hole-only and electron-only devices with the structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/terpolymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Al and ITO/ZnO/terpolymer:PC71BM/LiF/Al were fabricated, respectively, and their dark J–V characteristics were recorded. The dark J–V curves are presented in Fig. 5 and the corresponding results are listed in Table 3. The calculated hole mobility values of the devices were 2.94 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 0.20 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.14 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the electron mobility values of the devices were 3.65 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 0.54 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.10 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for P2FBT-25:PC71BM, P2FBT-50:PC71BM and P2FBT-75:PC71BM systems, respectively. It was shown that all the polymers showed well-balanced electron/hole mobility ratios in the range of 1–3. Clearly, the device containing P2FBT-75 exhibited more balanced hole and electron mobilities (μe:μh = 0.98) when compared to its counterparts P2FBT-25 (μe:μh = 1.23) and P2FBT-50 (μe:μh = 2.70), which can increase the Jsc and FF in the devices. As the processes of the accumulation of space charges and recombination of charge carriers are closely related to the carrier mobilities of electrons and holes, and the ratio between them, we attribute the improvement in Jsc and overall performance to much better charge transport and less charge recombination loss.

The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were analysed to study the charge transfer behavior within the blend films. The emission spectra of the pure terpolymer and polymer/PC71BM blend films are obtained and shown in Fig. 6. The pure P2FBT-25, P2FBT-50, and P2FBT-75 films exhibited a strong PL response ranging from 650 to 850 nm with the main peaks at 702, 704, and 701 nm, respectively. When blended with PC71BM, the PL emission peaks of the terpolymers were obviously quenched, indicating that efficient charge transfer between terpolymers and PC71BM occurred.49

Meanwhile, given the important role of film morphology of the active layer in determining the device performance of PSCs, the surface morphology of the photoactive layers was studied by tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). Fig. 7 shows the height and phase images of the as-cast and SVA blend films of P2FBT-25:PC71BM, P2FBT-50:PC71BM and P2FBT-75:PC71BM. As shown in Fig. 7, the nanophase miscibility of P2FBT-75 was comparable to those of the other two copolymers P2FBT-25 and P2FBT-50. Therefore, the exciton diffusion and charge transport were facilitated by virtue of increasing Jsc, leading to higher PCE values. The average roughness (RMS) values of the thin films without SVA treatment were measured and found to be 2.89, 1.95, and 1.78 nm, and the blend thin films with SVA treatment displayed decreased RMS values of 2.41, 1.31 and 1.19 nm, for P2FBT-25, P2FBT-50 and P2FBT-75, respectively. These values indicate that all of the terpolymer:PC71BM blend films show a relatively smooth and uniform surface, and much smaller crystallite domains are formed in the blend film comprising P2FBT-75 and PC71BM. The smoother surface morphology active layer was thought to be conducive to enhancing Jsc in BHJ-PSCs. This is indirect evidence of the favorable internal morphology of BHJ for higher performance PSCs.50

The relationship between the active layer film thickness and the device properties was examined by varying the thickness via manipulation of the solution concentration. Fig. 8 presented the Jsc, FF, Voc and PCE values of PSC devices based on the P2FBT-75:PC71BM system with different thicknesses of the active layer. The Jsc of the conventional devices initially slightly decreased, then significantly increased at a BHJ thickness of 203 nm, and then slightly decreased. At a BHJ thickness of 230 nm, the Jsc value reached its maximum at 12.0 mA cm−2. As the active layer thickness increased from 100 nm to 270 nm, the Jsc value remained constant at 11.3 ± 0.69 mA cm−2. The Voc values for all PSC devices with different BHJ thicknesses were the same, but the FF decreased obviously when the layer thickness was 210 nm. Correspondingly, the PCEs of the conventional PSC devices slightly decreased as the BHJ thickness increased. A PCE of 5.72% was observed for the PSCs with the BHJ thickness of 100–130 nm. Remarkably, PCEs of over 5.60% can be obtained in a thickness range of 100–170 nm, and the PCE of over 4.52% was observed even though the BHJ thickness was around 270 nm, exhibiting 2.1% and 21% PCE reductions relative to their initial performances, respectively. In short, the performance of PSC devices based on the P2FBT-75:PC71BM system is insensitive to BHJ thickness, and it is favorable for large-scale fabrication via roll-to-roll technology.

The decreased FF probably contributes to the shunt resistance (RSH) and series resistance (RS). The RSH decreases sharply with increasing BHJ thickness greater than 200 nm, in contrast, the RS exhibits the opposite tendency to the FF, whereby the RS increases for thicknesses of the BHJ active layer greater than 200 nm (Fig. 9). The smaller RS suggests that there is a favorable charge-carrier transport within the PSCs. On the other hand, the larger RSH suggests that the reverse current densities from the conventional devices are smaller, which implies an enlarged FF, and thus an enhanced PCE. In short, all results indicate that an enhanced charge-carrier recombination exists in thick BHJ composite films based on the P2FBT-75:PC71BM system.

3 Conclusions
Three D–A1–D–A2 random terpolymers P2FBT-25, P2FBT-50, and P2FBT-75, containing one electron-rich BDT unit and two electro-deficient units 2FBT and 2ORBT, have been designed and synthesized. By changing the molar ratio of the two acceptor units, the optical, electrochemical, and charge transport properties can be tuned. The optimal ratio of 75:25 between 2FBT and 2ORBT in the random terpolymers enhanced the efficiency of the P2FBT-75:PC71BM blend upon SVA treatment, exhibiting an efficiency of 5.72% due to improved light absorption and balanced charge transport. Noticeably, the three random copolymers that differ considerably in composition, all afford high PCEs, suggesting that high performance materials can be developed within a reasonable composition range via random copolymerization. More importantly, the PCE over 5.60% was observed in the P2FBT-75:PC71BM blend with an active layer thickness of 100–170 nm, exhibiting only 2.1% PCE reductions relative to their initial performances, and the PCE of over 4.52% was obtained even though the BHJ thickness was around 270 nm. This work provides an effective method to design polymers with high efficiency from the conventional PSC devices with such thick BHJ composite films, to provide a solution to resolving the bottleneck problem for manufacturing PSC products by a low-cost, high throughput roll-to-roll printing process.
4 Experimental
4.1 Materials
All reagents and starting materials were purchased from J&K Scientific and other commercial sources. The reagents and solvents were used as received without further purification unless otherwise mentioned, except for toluene were dried over Na/benzophenone ketyl and freshly distilled prior to use. All air and water sensitive reactions were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere. P2FBT-25, P2FBT-50 and P2FBT-75 were synthesized according to Scheme 1. Synthesis details are described below.
4.2 Characterization
UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded at room temperature using a Shimadzu UV-2006 ultraviolet-visible spectrometer. CV measurements were performed on a CHI660D electrochemical workstation under an argon atmosphere in a solution of nBu4NPF6 (0.1 M) in acetonitrile at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 at ambient temperature with a three-electrode cell consisting of a Pt working electrode, a saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE) and a Pt wire counter electrode. TGA measurements were performed on a STA-409 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. The molecular weights of the polymers were measured by GPC using THF as the eluent and polystyrene as the standard under 40 °C. Elemental analyses were performed using a German Vario EL III elemental analyzer. The surface roughness and morphology of thin films were characterized by using a tapping-mode atomic force microscope (AFM, Agilent 5400).
4.3 Photovoltaic device fabrication
Photovoltaic devices were fabricated on 19.1 × 19.1 mm2 patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates with a layered structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/LiF/Al. The ITO coated glass substrates were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol sequentially. The substrates were treated with oxygen plasma for 6 min, then spin-coated with a thin layer of PEDOT:PSS (30 nm) at 3000 rpm, and then dried at 125 °C for 20 min. The active layer was prepared by spin-coating blend solution of P2FBT-25:PC71BM, P2FBT-50:PC71BM and P2FBT-75:PC71BM (20 mg mL−1) with different weight ratios in chlorobenzene solution with 1% DIO on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS electrode. Subsequently, LiF (1 nm) and Al (100 nm) were thermally evaporated under a vacuum of ∼3 × 10−4 Pa on top of the active layer as a cathode. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit under illumination with AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) irradiation from a Newport solar simulator. The EQE of solar cells was analyzed using a certified Newport incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement system. The light intensity was calibrated using a standard silicon solar cell. The thickness of the active layer was determined using a Daktak 150 profilometer.
4.4 General synthetic procedure of polymers
The polymers were prepared by the same procedure through the Stille coupling reaction. In 50 mL two-necked flasks, several different ratios of BDT–Sn, 2FBT–Br and 2ORBT–Br were dissolved in 15 mL of anhydrous toluene. And the amounts of catalyst and ligand were Pd2dba3 (6 mmol%) and P(o-tolyl)3 (20 mmol%). The mixture was stirred and purged with argon for 15 min and vigorously stirred at 115 °C for 60 h under argon. After cooling down to room temperature, the solution was added dropwise to methanol and filtered. The crude product was purified by Soxhlet extraction with methanol, hexane, acetone and chloroform in succession. The chloroform fractions were collected, concentrated, reprecipitated in methanol, and dried under vacuum overnight to give the target polymers.
