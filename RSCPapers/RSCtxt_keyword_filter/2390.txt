Gradient annealed perovskite films exhibit more uniform and smooth surface with improved coverage compared to directly annealed films. The resulting perovskite solar cells show enhanced device performance with a high efficiency of 14%, indicating that the gradient annealing process is a useful way to improve the efficiency of perovskite solar cells.
Organic–inorganic hybrid solar cells using halide lead perovskite materials as the photoactive layers have shown a rapid development in the past few years since the first organometal halide perovskite solar cells reported in 2009.1 The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have been increased from 3.8% to 20.1% in just five years, revealing their great potential for future commercialization.1–10 Perovskite solar cells utilizing mesoporous n-type metal oxide semiconductors (TiO2, Al2O3, et al.) usually generate high PCEs.3,6,11–13 For instance, efficiencies more than 18% have been recently reported for perovskite solar cells based on the rational incorporation of MAPbBr3 into FAPbI3 by using a mesoporous layer of TiO2.14 In addition to the perovskite solar cells that combine a mesoporous electron transporting scaffold, planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells have recently attracted increasing attention due to their high efficiency and the low-temperature fabrication process.15–19 Very recently, Im and co-workers have reported that a high PCE of 18.1% can be achieved for planar MAPbI3 perovskite hybrid solar cells with an inverted device architecture and the incorporation of dense pinhole-free MAPbI3 as the light absorber.20
It has been realized now that the crystallinity and the surface coverage of perovskite films play significant roles in determining the performance of perovskite solar cells, which are critical to the charge transport and the stability of perovskite solar cells.15,21,22 Efforts have been devoted to improving the crystallization and film coverage of the perovskite films. Numerous efficient approaches such as thermal/solvent annealing,11,23,24 additive,25–27 multi-step procedure3,28–30 have been employed to control crystal growth and the film uniformity. Among the various approaches, thermal annealing has been employed to complete the conversion from the perovskite precursor into the perovskite film. The direct annealing (DA) at the temperature of, for example, 90 °C has been widely used to anneal the perovskite films.31 In this contribution, we demonstrated that a gradient annealing process (GA) can be used to prepare the uniform perovskite films. In such a GA process, the perovskite film showed more uniform and smooth surface than the films directly annealed. The corresponding solar cells showed a high PCE of 14.0%, while the PCE of solar cells based on perovskite films with the DA process was 12.6%. The 11% improvement in efficiency is mainly ascribed to the improved perovskite film coverage, rather than the enhanced crystallization. This work paves the new way for improving the performance of organometal halide perovskite solar cells.
CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, I) perovskite materials have been reported to possess excellent photovoltaic property with high PCEs. The orthorhombic crystal structure of mixed-halide CH3NH3PbI3−xClx was shown in Fig. 1a, where blue spheres represent methylammonium cations, green spheres represent lead atoms, and purple spheres represent halide ions (I or Cl). The normalized UV-visible absorption spectra of the perovskite films prepared with the GA and DA processes were showed in Fig. 1b. The perovskite films were prepared according to the following steps: firstly, the perovskite precursor solutions were spin cast on top of the ITO/poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) substrates; then the films were treated via different thermal annealing processes. The total annealing time for the two processes is equal to 60 min. For samples with the GA process, the films were annealed at 80 °C for 20 min. Then, the temperature was increased steadily to 85 °C and the samples were annealed at this temperature for 20 min. After that, the temperature was further increased to 90 °C and the perovskite films were annealed for another 20 min. For the direct annealing process, the samples were annealed at 90 °C for 60 min. We noticed that the color of perovskite films was changed from bright yellow to dark brown after annealing at 90 °C. As shown in Fig. 1b, there is low absorption in the wavelength range of 410–750 nm for perovskite films annealed at 80 °C and 85 °C, respectively. The absorption in this range was dramatically enhanced for perovskite films annealed at 90 °C, which confirmed the fact that the conversion process from the perovskite precursor into the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite crystal upon annealing. In addition, we find that the perovskite films with the DA process show slightly red shift when compared to the perovskite films with the GA process, which probably comes from the difference in crystallization behavior for the films under different annealing conditions.

The crystallization behavior of the resulting perovskite films was studied by using X-ray diffraction measurements (XRD). As shown in Fig. 2, there are two main reflections located at 14.2° and 28.5°, corresponding to the (110) and (220) crystal planes of the orthorhombic lattice of mixed halide perovskites. The diffraction peaks at 14.2° increased significantly for perovskite films annealed at 90 °C, indicating the formation of perovskite crystal. When compared to the perovskite films with the GA process, perovskite films prepared through the DA process exhibited stronger reflections, suggesting the increased crystallization for the latter films.

Fig. 3 showed the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the top topography of the evolving CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films at different magnifications. In terms of the films annealed at 80 °C, it shows that the perovskite precursors are randomly connected. Although the films look smooth, the perovskite materials are lacking the clear crystalline structure. As the annealing temperature increased to 85 °C, there is an obvious change in the appearance of the films. The films are composed of a lot of large perovskite domains. According to the XRD results, the annealing temperature at 85 °C is insufficient to lead to the formation of perovskite crystals. The large perovskite domains are still the perovskite precursor materials. When the annealing temperature was further increased to 90 °C, strip-like perovskite crystals were observed and the perovskite films are smooth and uniform with nearly 100% film coverage. The crystalline grain domains in perovskite films with the DA process were much larger than those prepared through the GA process. For the GA process, the annealing temperature was increased gradually from 80 °C to 90 °C, which can slow down the perovskite formation process, resulting in a better surface coverage. In contrast, the direct annealing at 90 °C would accelerate the formation of perovskite crystal and create lots of pinholes within the films, which will have negative influence on the charge transport and the stability of perovskite solar cells.

Perovskite solar cells with the device architecture of FTO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/phenyl-C60-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/Al were fabricated. The schematic energy diagram of each component in the device was shown in Fig. S1.† After the PCBM layer spin cast on top of the perovskite films and the deposition of the Al electrode, the perovskite solar cells were measured under the simulated AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2). Since the large photocurrent hysteresis was observed in many organometal trihalide perovskite solar cells and becomes a major issue in accurate characterization of the solar cell efficiency,8,32,33 in this study, partial devices were measured with different scanning directions (reverse and forward scans) to measure the photocurrent hysteresis (Table S1†). The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of all solar cells were shown in Fig. 4. The device parameters are summarized in Table 1.

J–V curves measured in the reverse and forward scanning directions for solar cells with the gradient annealing process (b) and the direct annealing process (c). (d) IPCE plots and the integrated current density of perovskite solar cells fabricated through different annealing processes. 
Perovskite solar cells fabricated with the GA process exhibited no photocurrent hysteresis when devices measured in the reverse and forward scanning directions, showing nearly the same PCEs (14.0% vs. 13.8%). For solar cells fabricated with the DA process, obvious photocurrent hysteresis was observed. The device measured in the reverse direction showed a PCE of 12.6% with short-circuit current (Jsc) of 17.9 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.92 V, and fill factor (FF) of 76.3%, while the cell measured in the forward direction exhibited a low PCE of 11.7%, mainly due to the decreased FF (72.3%). Recently, Huang and co-workers reported that the trap states on the surface and grain boundaries of the perovskite materials are the origin of photocurrent hysteresis in perovskite solar cells.34 As shown in Fig. 3d, the large grain boundaries and few pin holes may cause the photocurrent hysteresis. The incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) plots of solar cells are displayed in Fig. 4d. The maximum IPCE value of devices with the GA and DA processes was nearly 80.0%. Obvious increases in IPCE in the wavelength range of 350–750 nm contributes to the increased Jsc of the devices fabricated with the GA process.
To further understand the performance differences between solar cells fabricated with the different annealing processes, more than 30 devices were fabricated in parallel for comparison. As shown in Table 1, the cells fabricated with the GA process showed an average PCE of 12.6% with Jsc of 17.9 mA cm−2, and Voc of 0.94 V, which are higher than devices with the DA process (Fig. S2 and S3†). The champion cell fabricated with the GA process showed a high PCE of 14%, with Jsc of 18.6 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.96 V, and FF of 78.3%. The Jsc calculated from IPCE spectrum was 18.3 mA cm−2, which is in good agreement with the Jsc obtained from J–V curves (18.6 mA cm−2) with a 1.7% mismatch. In the wavelength range of 400–750 nm, IPCE values are all higher than 60% with the maximum value of 80% at 470 nm, indicating high charge collection efficiency in cells.
The charge transport properties of perovskite layers were investigated by using space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. The hole mobility was measured with the hole-only diode (FTO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/MoOx/Al) (Fig. S4†). The hole mobility of perovskite films prepared via GA process is 1.8 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is slightly higher than that (1.3 × 10−2) of the perovskite films with the DA process, agreeing well with the higher Jsc value measured from I–V curves.
In conclusion, we demonstrated an efficient gradient annealing approach to improve the perovskite film coverage for low-temperature processed planar-heterojunction perovskite solar cells. The direct annealing process would accelerate the formation of perovskite crystal and create lots of pinholes within the films. The gradient annealing process can slow down the perovskite formation process, resulting in a better surface coverage. As a result, solar cells fabricated with the gradient annealing process show no photocurrent hysteresis with enhanced performance when compared to the cells with the direct annealing process. A high efficiency of 14% can be achieved, indicating that the gradient annealing process is a useful way to improve the efficiency of perovskite solar cells.
Experimental section
Materials and sample preparation
The methylammonium iodide (MAI) was synthesized by reaction with equimolar methylamine and hydriodic according to the previous reports.2,26 MAI and PbCl2 was mixed in anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF) by a molar ratio of 3:1 with 1% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) to form the perovskite precursor solution (40 wt%). The mixture was stirred at 70 °C for overnight and kept at 90 °C with stirring for 15 min before use. The fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glasses were ultrasonic cleaned in soapy water, deionized water, acetone, isopropanol, respectively, then dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 110 °C and treated by UV–ozone for 30 min before use.
Device fabrication and characterization
PEDOT:PSS was spin cast on top of FTO substrate at the speed of 4000 rpm for 40 s and dried at 145 °C for 10 min in air. Then, the substrate was transferred into nitrogen filled glove box. Perovskite precursor was spin cast atop the FTO/PEDOT:PSS substrate at 5000 rpm for 50 s. After exposure in N2 atmosphere at room temperature for 10 min, the samples were placed onto a hotplate. For samples with the gradient annealing process, the films were annealed at 80 °C for 20 min, and the temperature was increased to 85 °C. The samples were annealed at this temperature for 20 min. After that, the temperature was further increased to 90 °C and the samples were annealed at 90 °C for another 20 min. For the direct annealing process, the samples were annealed at 90 °C for 60 min. After annealing at 90 °C, both samples turned to dark brown. Afterwards, PCBM layer was deposited onto the perovskite film from a chloroform solution (15 mg ml−1) by spin coating at 1500–3500 rpm for 40 s. To complete the fabrication of device, a 100 nm-thick Al cathode was thermal evaporated onto the PCBM layer through a shadow mask (active area 4.5 mm2) under a high vacuum pressure (6 × 10−5 Pa). During the measurement, an aperture with the area of 3.14 mm2 was used to block stray light. Perovskite solar cells with GA and DA processes are measured under the same conditions. The devices were fabricated and measured all at N2 atmosphere in a glove box. The devices were measured with different scanning directions (reverse and forward scans). The scanning rate during the measurements is 25 mV s−1 and the delay time is 10 ms. Current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured using a Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit. Solar cell performance used an Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5G) solar simulator (Class AAA solar simulator, Model 94063A, Oriel) with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2, which was measured by a calibrated silicon solar cell and a readout meter (Model 91150V, Newport). IPCE spectra were measured by using a QEX10 Solar Cell IPCE measurement system (PV measurements, Inc.).
Film characterization
The SEM measurements were carried out on a Quanta 250 FEG SEM. The XRD measurements were recorded on. Shimadzu Lab-X XRD-6000 diffractometer with Cu Kα, λ = 1.54060 Å (the scan rate is 4° min−1). UV-vis absorption measurements were carried out on a Shimadzu (Model UV-3600) UV-vis spectrophotometer.
