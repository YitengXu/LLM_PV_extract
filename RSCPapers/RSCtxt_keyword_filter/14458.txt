N-Substitution in perylene diimide (PDI) n-type semiconductors is critical for their performance in organic bulk heterojunction solar cells. In this work we synthesized and compared three perylene diimide-spirobifluorene derivatives, N-substituted with different alkyl side groups. These molecular systems were obtained by cost-effective methods, using straightforward synthetic procedures and easy purification. These PDI derivatives were used as electron acceptor materials, blended with a benchmark quinoxaline–benzodithiophene based donor polymer, in bulk heterojunction solar cells. All devices were processed by blade coating in air, and also using non-chlorinated solvents. The three molecules presented identical HOMO/LUMO energy levels and very similar optical properties but different photovoltaic responses. These different performances were discussed through optical, electrical and morphological characterizations. The highest power conversion efficiency was achieved for the active layer based on the derivative with branched and longer alkyl groups in N-positions, which favored a morphology with reduced donor:acceptor phase segregation.
Introduction
Solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) are a possible alternative technology for the generation of sustainable energy. OSCs offer benefits in terms of processing costs, large area production, compatibility with flexible and light-weight supports, abundant and non-toxic elements and structural tunability at different levels.1 Some strategic aspects of the OSC technology are: (i) the use of deposition methods, at laboratory-scale, compatible with industrial production systems;2 (ii) the replacement of common chlorinated solvents with alternative ones, having reduced costs, toxicity and environmental impact;3 and (iii) competitive efficiency. Within solution-processed OSCs, lab-scale single layer bulk heterojunction (BHJ) devices have reached efficiencies >10% due to the synergic development of novel active materials,4 in depth understanding of polymeric film microstructures5 and meticulous device optimization,6 indicating their potential for future commercial applications.7
The properties of active materials still play a crucial role for the achievement of efficient OSCs.8 Fullerene derivatives have been the most used acceptors thanks to their high and isotropic electron mobility, good solubility, proper nanoscale domain formation, etc.9 However, fullerene derivatives also have some drawbacks, such as low absorption coefficient and low spectral coverage, hard purification and high cost, limited energy level tunability, morphological instability, and inferior mechanical flexibility.10 For these reasons it is not clear whether fullerene derivatives are ultimately the best candidate materials, and therefore many efforts have been focused on the development of alternative non-fullerene acceptors. Various small molecules/polymers having acceptor properties have been recently designed and found to generate performances greater than those achieved using fullerenes, with greater than 13% efficiency.11
Within non-fullerene materials, perylene diimide derivatives (PDIs) are suitable candidates as acceptors in OSCs, because of their low cost, high absorption coefficient, good photochemical stability and chemical versatility.12 Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) beyond 8% were reported using helical PDI trimers blended with PTB7 in single-junction BHJ solar cells,13 and PCEs >10% were obtained with PDI derivatives in tandem devices.14 Although the performances are rather high, it is difficult to imagine that complicated synthetic procedures used for the preparation and purification of helical PDIs and/or complex solar cell architectures may be adapted eventually for scale-up. Therefore, it is mandatory to design low cost materials, by employing straightforward synthetic and purification procedures for their use in cost-effective BHJ solar cells with simple architectures.
Perylene diimides have two chemically active centers: imide positions and bay positions.15 The imide positions are usually substituted with linear or branched alkyl chains to increase solubility and modulate the self-organization in the solid state,16 while the bay substitution is used both to tune the HOMO–LUMO electronic levels and, depending on the substituent, to twist the perylene core.17 Indeed, the presence of sterically hindered moieties in the bay positions generates out-of-plane PDI structures, hindering intra- and inter-molecular interactions in the solid state.18 For photovoltaic applications, the presence of strong intermolecular interactions could determine the formation of (too) large crystalline domains which, through exciton self-trapping, could limit charge generation.19
In our previous studies several PDI derivatives based on different building blocks were designed, studied and characterized.20 These acceptor molecules were designed with the aim to reduce PDI's tendency to aggregate and crystallize in the solid state, by the introduction of sterically demanding moieties on the perylene core. Among them, PDI-SF-nd (Fig. 1) containing a spirobifluorene moiety in the bay position resulted in the best performing acceptor material in combination with P3HT, yielding a PCE of ∼1.5%. The presence of the spirobifluorene unit reduces the aggregation in the solid state due to its unique cross-shape rigid structure and strong steric hindrance, while its electron donor ability contributes to the extension of the absorption. This prompted us to further investigate the impact of fine structural tuning, such as the PDI N-substitution with differently shaped alkyl groups, on this promising molecular structure.

Considering the importance of understanding the structure–property relationship and the effect of structural modification on OSC performance, we report here the comparison of three molecular PDI derivatives (Fig. 1) having a sterically hindered spirobifluorene (SF) unit in the bay position and different alkyl side chains at the imide position: 10-nonadecyl (PDI-SF-nd),20 2-ethylhexyl (PDI-SF-eh) and n-dodecyl (PDI-SF-d). The corresponding optical, electrochemical, morphological and photovoltaic properties of all three PDIs were systematically investigated. Using a benzodithiophene–quinoxaline based polymer (PFQBDT-TR1)21 as a p-type material, the resulting BHJ solar cells gave PCEs ranging from 0.5% to 1.5% as a function of different designs of the acceptor molecules.
Experimental section
Materials
All starting materials were purchased from Aldrich and used as received without further purification. Solvents and reagents were dried and/or distilled by the usual methods and typically used under an inert gas atmosphere. The PDI derivatives were prepared by a Suzuki cross-coupling reaction and a detailed procedure for their synthesis is reported in the ESI† (Schemes S1 and S2).
Cyclic voltammetry
Cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed in dichloromethane solution containing tetrabutyl ammonium tetrafluoroborate (0.1 M) as the electrolyte, under a nitrogen atmosphere with a computer controlled Amel 2053 (with Amel 7800 interface) electrochemical workstation, in a three electrode single-compartment cell using a platinum plate as the working electrode, a platinum wire as the counter electrode and an SCE standard reference electrode. An Fc/Fc+ redox couple was used as the internal standard. A scan rate of 50 mV s−1 was used for all measurements.
Device fabrication and characterization
As already described in ref. 21 we report the main details regarding the fabrication and characterization of all devices. The materials used, PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate), Clevios P VP A1 4083, H. C. Starck), PC61BM ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester, Solenne BV), 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and various anhydrous solvents (Sigma-Aldrich) were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification. Patterned ITO-coated glasses (Rs ∼ 10 Ω sq−1) were cleaned in deionized water, acetone and isopropanol baths under ultrasonication for 15 minutes. After the final sonication step, substrates were dried and placed in an oxygen plasma chamber for 5 min. A layer (∼40 nm; blade speed 2 mm s−1 at 30 °C) of PEDOT:PSS (or ZnO, provided by Genes’Ink, for inverted structures, Table S1, ESI†) was blade-coated in air on the top of the ITO and then annealed at 150 °C for 15 min (or 80 °C for 5 min for ZnO). The active solutions were prepared inside the glove-box, dissolved in ODCB:DIO (97:3; % v/v) or o-xylene:DIO (97:3; % v/v) at a total concentration of 30 mg mL−1, and kept under stirring overnight at 80 °C. Lower concentrations (25 or 20 mg mL−1) were also used for 1:3 PFQBDT-TR1:PDI-SF-nd based solutions. The resulting blends were deposited in air by blade-coating (blade speed of 7.5 mm s−1 at 80 °C or 5 mm s−1 at 60 °C for ODCB and o-xylene based solutions, respectively) on the top of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS (or ZnO) surface. Before cathode (or anode for inverted structures) deposition, the substrates were annealed or left as-cast. Next, LiF (0.6 nm) and Al (100 nm) (or MoO3 (10 nm)/Ag (100 nm) for inverted devices) were deposited in a vacuum chamber. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of all devices were recorded using a Keithley 236 source-measure unit under AM1.5G simulated light, 100 mW cm−2 (Abet Technologies Sun 2000 Solar Simulator). The active area of the solar cell was exactly 6 mm2. During testing, each cell was carefully masked using a calibrated mask. All devices were tested, without encapsulation, inside the glove box in an oxygen and moisture free environment.
Electron mobility was calculated from the dark J–V curves of electron-only devices (structure: glass/ITO/ZnO (40 nm)/active layer/LiF (0.6 nm)/Al (100 nm)) based on the best performing films, using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method through the Mott–Gurney equation:22J = (9/8)μεrε0V2/d3, where J is the current density, μ is the mobility, εr is the relative permittivity of the blend, ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum, d is the thickness of the active layer, and V is the voltage. The resulting curves are plotted as J1/2vs. V (Fig. S2, ESI†).
Thin film characterization
All thin-film characterizations were performed in air. The solution and film optical absorption spectra were recorded on a JASCO V-550 spectrophotometer. The thickness of the various films was measured using a profilometer (KLA Tencor, P-6). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were recorded using a Solver Pro (NT-934 MDT) scanning probe microscope in tapping mode. All active films were characterized after deposition on glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS sub-structures (and then corrected for the background signal) in order to mimic the real working conditions of the BHJ blends. The emission spectra were measured using a PerkinElmer LS-50 spectrofluorometer in reflection mode.
Results and discussion
Chemical structure
PFQBDT-TR1 and PDI-SF-nd were synthesized by Stille or Suzuki coupling reactions as already reported in the literature, while PDI-SF-eh and PDI-SF-d were synthesized using a similar procedure reported in the ESI.†
The three acceptor molecules present the same PDI core bay-substituted with a spirobifluorene unit, and different alkyl chains at the imide positions. Quantum chemical calculations have already shown that the PDI and the spirobifluorene moieties adopt a highly twisted conformation, with a dihedral angle between them of approximately 50°.23 This is expected to provide the three acceptor molecules good solubility in common organic solvents (>25 mg mL−1) and a low intermolecular aggregation tendency in the solid state. However, the different alkyl chains at the imide positions can further tune the solubility and miscibility of the molecules with a polymeric donor, as discussed below.
Optical and electrochemical properties
As shown in Fig. 2a and listed in Table 1, the absorption spectra of PDI-SF-nd, PDI-SF-eh, and PDI-SF-d acceptors in diluted solutions are almost perfectly overlapped. The spectra have a typical pattern of bay substituted PDIs and extend from 300 to 650 nm, with a weaker absorption band at 433–435 nm, a more intense bandwidth maximum at 576–580 nm and one vibrational shoulder. Passing from diluted solutions to thin films, the spectra of the three PDI-based acceptors remain almost overlapped (Fig. 2b).

In detail, for the three molecules the higher energy band still lies at 432–438 nm, while the lower energy and more intense band is blue-shifted by 15 nm to 562–565 nm, likely due to the switch between the relative intensities of the two vibrational features of the band. This shift corresponds also to a red-shift of the absorption onset wavelength (λonset) of the molecules in the solid state, which increases by around 20 nm passing from PDI-SF-nd to PDI-SF-d. This is traduced into a reduction of the optical band gaps following the trend PDI-SF-nd > PDI-SF-eh > PDI-SF-d. Most probably, the longer and branched alkyl side chains of PDI-SF-nd hinder ordering, while a slightly higher aggregation tendency is favored by the short branched alkyl chains of PDI-SF-eh and even more by the long linear alkyl chains of PDI-SF-d. However, the three structures present good solubility in common organic solvents with a generally low aggregation/ordering tendency in the solid state. In Fig. 2b the normalized absorption spectrum of the polymer PFQBDT-TR1 is also reported. The blend of the polymer with any of the three acceptors is expected to give a good coverage of the sun's spectrum, between 300 and 750 nm. Indeed, the absorption spectra of the active layers of the optimized devices based on PFQBDT-TR1 and the three acceptors well cover all wavelengths up to 750 nm (see Fig. 4e).
The EHOMO and ELUMO of the acceptors, PDI-SF-nd, PDI-SF-eh, and PDI-SF-d, and of the donor, PFQBDT-TR1, were determined by cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S1 ESI†) and calculated from their optical band gaps (Table 1). Since the bay substitution moiety is the same for all three PDIs, the EHOMO and ELUMO are very similar for the three acceptors. As known from the literature, indeed, PDIs’ frontier molecular orbitals have nodes at the nitrogen atom, and this reduces the coupling between the perylene core and the imide substituents.24 The EHOMO and ELUMO positions indicate that PDI-SF-nd, PDI-SF-eh, and PDI-SF-d have suitable energy levels to be used as acceptors in BHJ solar cells with PFQBDT-TR1 as the donor. Notably, the small offset between the ELUMO of the BHJ components is not an issue for non-fullerene-based devices, since it is known that photogenerated excitons can separate very efficiently upon small and/or negligible driving energies, contributing to high photovoltages and overall PCEs.11a,25
The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the pristine polymer and optimized blended films were also recorded (Fig. S3, ESI†). The PL spectra were collected by exciting the films both at 650 nm and 565 nm. At 650 nm the absorption of the polymer is predominant compared to the PDI-acceptor contributions (Fig. 2b). The PL of the resulting BHJ films can be attributed to the polymer quenched emission. Energy transfer processes can be reasonably excluded due to the unfavorable spectral overlap between the polymer emission and the acceptors’ absorption and due to the absence of acceptors’ emission features in the PL spectra of the blends (Fig. S3B, ESI†). Therefore, the charge transfer between the excited polymer and the acceptor molecules is the main process responsible for the PL quenching in the blends. In addition, by exciting the blends at 565 nm (Fig. S3B, ESI†) we investigated the emission signal arising from the acceptor molecules (≈650 nm, as reported in ref. 20b). The resulting quenched emissions suggested even in this case an efficient charge transfer (holes) from the excited acceptor(s) to the donor polymer.
Finally, while a similarly efficient photoinduced charge transfer can be reasonably supposed for all the three optimized blends based on PFQBDT-TR1 and the PDI-acceptor(s), their charge dynamics (mobility, recombinations, etc.) could be different, affecting the resulting photovoltaic properties (see the following sections).
Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic properties of the three acceptors were tested in devices with standard configuration: glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BHJ active layer/LiF/Al. The organic layers of the solar cells (PEDOT:PSS and the BHJ active layer) were deposited in air by blade-coating, which is an easy, reproducible and scalable deposition method.26 The photovoltaic responses of PFQBDT-TR1:PDI-SF-nd/PDI-SF-eh/PDI-SF-d based solar cells depend on the active layer processing in terms of BHJ blend composition and solvent, deposition parameters and thickness, and thermal annealing. These variables are indeed critical to simultaneously optimize the optical, electrical and morphological properties of the BHJ blends. The processing conditions and the photovoltaic responses of the PFQBDT-TR1:PDI-SF-nd/PDI-SF-eh/PDI-SF-d based solar cells prepared during optimization are reported in Table S1 (ESI†). Additional details regarding the fabrication and characterization of the OSCs are reported in the experimental section. The optimized processing conditions and the relative photovoltaic response curves and data, including VOC, JSC, FF and PCE, are summarized in Table 2 and Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  
J–V curves of the best devices based on PFQBDT-TR1 with PDI-SF-nd (black), PDI-SF-eh (blue) or PDI-SF-d (green). 
The best D:A ratio was 1:2 (w/w) for all acceptors, different from the reference devices based on P3HT:PDI-SF-nd20 and PFQBDT-TR1:PCBM21 for which the best ratio was 1:1 (w/w). Note that, by further increasing the D:A ratio of the PDI-based blends to 1:3 w/w a detrimental impact in terms of morphological and photovoltaic properties was observed (Table S1, ESI†).
Overall, the FF of the devices, even after thermal annealing, is quite low (<33%, Table 2) highlighting the presence of significant internal resistances. This is most likely due to a suboptimal charge transport/collection causing recombination processes to occur in the active layer. Within the three acceptors, the best PCE was obtained for PDI-SF-nd, with a value of 1.5%, while a PCE of 0.5% and of 0.9% was obtained for PDI-SF-eh and PDI-SF-d, respectively. The observed PCE trend is mainly governed by the JSC of the solar cells, which follows the same trend (PDI-SF-nd > PDI-SF-d > PDI-SF-eh). Since the thickness and the optical properties of all BHJ devices are almost identical, the trend of the resulting JSC could be related to the different nanoscale morphologies and charge transport properties of the active blends, as discussed in the next section. Notably, by substituting ODCB with the non-chlorinated and more environmentally friendly o-xylene (o-xy), the photovoltaic parameters and the overall PCE of the best performing devices remain almost unvaried, confirming the good solubility and processability of this class of non-fullerene acceptors.

Interestingly, despite the significant recombination loss processes and internal resistances within the different active layers, as suggested by the shape of the corresponding J–V curves (Fig. 3), the VOC of all devices is still remarkable. This indicates that despite significant voltage losses due to internal inefficient mechanisms, the almost aligned LUMO levels of the BHJ components guarantee satisfying VOC values, comparable to the reference system based on PCBM (VOC: 0.83 V, Table S1, ESI†).
Note that, the different VOC observed for PFQBDT-TR1:PDI-SF-nd (≈0.76 V) and PFQBDT-TR1:PDI-SF-eh/PDI-SF-d (≈0.83 V) based BHJ solar cells can be ascribed to different BHJ nanomorphologies, as discussed below.27
Morphological properties
The nanomorphology of the active layer plays an important role in determining the photovoltaic performance of a BHJ solar cell. To better understand how the alkyl chains of the molecular acceptors affect the solar cell characteristics, we investigated by tapping-mode AFM the morphology of the PFQBDT-TR1:PDI-SF-nd/PDI-SF-eh/PDI-SF-d blends processed under optimal conditions (Fig. 4).

We compared these nanomorphologies with that of the reference PFQBDT-TR1:PCBM blend. Although the surface roughness is almost the same for the four blends (root mean square between 0.7 and 1 nm), their morphological features are slightly different and correlate well with the photovoltaic responses previously discussed. In the case of the reference PFQBDT-TR1:PCBM blend, a well defined nanostructuring of the surface into small domains is observed (Fig. 4d). This indicates an optimal donor:acceptor phase segregation into nanocrystalline aggregates, which favors the generation and transport of free charges in both the polymeric donor and fullerene acceptor domains. This is traduced into a highly performing solar cell.21 By contrast, the topography of the best performing blend, within the series PFQBDT-TR1:PDI-SF-nd/PDI-SF-eh/PDI-SF-d, shows nanostructures with undefined D:A domains (PFQBDT-TR1:PDI-SF-nd in Fig. 4a), whilst the lowest performing blend presents more defined and finely nanostructured domains (PFQBDT-TR1:PDI-SF-eh in Fig. 4b) and the intermediate performing an intermediate topography (PFQBDT-TR1:PDI-SF-d in Fig. 4c). This different segregation tendency of the BHJ blends is also confirmed by the corresponding UV-Vis spectra (Fig. 4e). In particular, the relative intensity of the shoulder in the longer-wavelength side of the spectra (ca. 650 nm), originating from intermolecular interactions within polymeric chains, gradually increases passing from PDI-SF-nd, to PDI-SF-d to PDI-SF-eh based blends, suggesting a gradual increase of the corresponding D:A phase segregation. This is in perfect agreement with the previous consideration: the longer and branched alkyl side chains of PDI-SF-nd partially hinder intermolecular ordering. From the morphological and UV-Vis data on the blends, we can add that the side groups of PDI-SF-nd favor its miscibility with the PFQBDT-TR1 polymeric chains.
In contrast, the short branched alkyl chains of PDI-SF-eh are not sufficiently long to favor the same donor:acceptor intermixing. Rather, they favor intermolecular ordering both within the acceptor domains and, as a consequence, also within the PFQBDT-TR1 domains. The (single) long and linear alkyl chain of PDI-SF-d favors an intermediate interpenetration of the donor:acceptor domains. Of note, the supposed enhanced self-organization passing from PDI-SF-nd, to PDI-SF-d to PDI-SF-eh based blends correlates well with the increase of the corresponding VOC, which is known to strongly depend on nanostructural factors of the active layer.28 The enhanced nanoscale organization of the active blends (PDI-SF-nd < PDI-SF-d < PDI-SF-eh) determines a reduction of the PCE of the corresponding devices (PDI-SF-nd > PDI-SF-d > PDI-SF-eh). This could be explained by the different n and/or p charge mobilities of the PDI-SF-nd, PDI-SF-eh and PDI-SF-d based BHJ blends. In our previous studies on PDI-spirobifluorene based molecules, we demonstrated that the different chemical structures of the acceptors did not have any influence on their electron mobility in pure films (10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1).20 Rather, we observed a reduction of the electron mobility of the PDI-SF molecules when blended with P3HT, in particular those blends showing a more segregated/coarser nanomorphology. Therefore, unbalanced electron and hole mobility caused non-geminate recombinations that drastically limited the JSC, FF and the PCE of the corresponding devices. In this work, the phase segregation/nanostructuring increases with a trend which reflects the JSC, the FF and the PCE in the corresponding solar cells. Similarly to our previous work, we verified that also in this case the increase in the phase segregation is accompanied by a slight decrease of the electron mobility of the blend films. We measured the electron mobility using electron-only devices based on PFQBDT-TR1:PDI-SF-nd, PFQBDT-TR1:PDI-SF-d and PFQBDT-TR1:PDI-SF-eh blends (Fig. S2, ESI†). The resulting mobilities were: ∼6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, 3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 respectively for PFQBDT-TR1:PDI-SF-nd, PFQBDT-TR1:PDI-SF-d and PFQBDT-TR1:PDI-SF-eh films. The higher electron mobility, favored by the longer and branched alkyl side chains of PDI-SF-nd, which likely favor donor:acceptor miscibility, correlates well with the enhanced PCE of the corresponding devices. On the other hand, the lower electron mobility for PFQBDT-TR1:PDI-SF-d and PFQBDT-TR1:PDI-SF-eh films, combined with an enhanced donor:acceptor phase segregation, could be responsible for geminate recombination losses which limit the performances of the corresponding devices.
We conclude that the fine modifications of the molecular structure of the acceptors have a strong influence on their physical properties, such as solubility, super-saturation thermodynamics, precipitation kinetics and miscibility with the donor material, for example. These properties in turn strongly influence the BHJ nanomorphology and consequently the photovoltaic response of the solar cells.
Conclusions
In this work we studied the structure–property relationship and the photovoltaic characteristics of three perylene diimide-spirobifluorene derivatives, N-substituted with different alkyl side groups: 10-nonadecyl (PDI-SF-nd), 2-ethylhexyl (PDI-SF-eh) and n-dodecyl (PDI-SF-d). These molecules were synthesized by cost-effective methods, using a straightforward synthesis and an easy purification. The optical and electrochemical properties of the three molecules were very similar. However, the photovoltaic properties of the resulting blade-coated BHJ solar cells, based on their BHJ blends with a benchmark quinoxaline–benzodithiophene donor polymer (PFQBDT-TR1), were different. In detail, the highest PCE (1.5%) was achieved for the PDI-SF-nd derivative having branched and longer alkyl groups in N-positions (10-nonadecyl), while the lowest PCE (0.5%) was achieved for the PDI-SF-eh derivative, bearing branched and short alkyl chains in N-positions (2-ethylhexyl). We demonstrated that the different photovoltaic responses of the three molecules were due to their different miscibility/self-aggregation within the BHJ blend, as a function of length and conformation of the alkyl side chains. This was reflected in a different nanomorphology of the active layers, with a donor:acceptor phase segregation increasing when passing from long branched alkyl chains (PDI-SF-nd) to long linear ones (PDI-SF-d) to short branched ones (PDI-SF-eh). The increasing phase segregation of the blends, accompanied by a reduction of the electron mobility, was probably the origin of internal resistances and recombination losses, which limited the photovoltaic response of the corresponding solar cells.
In conclusion, this work provides a contribution to the development of design rules for the engineering of the side chains in the N-positions of PDI-based molecular acceptors, through easy synthetic methods, towards efficient and scalable non-fullerene-based BHJ organic solar cells.
