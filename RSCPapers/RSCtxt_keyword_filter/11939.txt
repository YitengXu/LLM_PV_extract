    , Accepted 26th October 2012First published on 29th October 2012AbstractThe dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) using SnO2 and Nb2O5 counter electrodes (CEs) prepared in N2 atmosphere yielded power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 6.09% and 4.65%, much higher than the PCE values (1.84%, 0.97%) of the DSCs using the same SnO2 and Nb2O5 CEs prepared in air.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have achieved great advancement since 1991. To date, the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of this kind of solar cells is up to 12–13%.1,2 Besides the decent PCE, the merits of low cost, environmental friendliness, color varieties, and easy building integration make the DSCs more attractive amongst various photovoltaic devices. In a DSC, there are three key components containing a photoanode (dye-sensitized oxide semiconductor), an electrolyte (containing redox couples), and a counter electrode (CE), contributing to generate electricity.
As a crucial component, CE is generally FTO glass deposited with Pt film. At the background of commercial utilization, low cost CE catalysts are required. In recent years, many Pt-free CE catalysts have been proposed one after the other, such as carbon materials,3–5 conductive polymers,6–8 transition metal carbides, nitrides, oxides, sulfides, phosphides, and selenides.9–15 We found that some oxides could be used as not only semiconductors in the photoanodes but also catalysts in the CEs.16 In this Communication, it was noted that the catalytic activities of the SnO2 and Nb2O5 CEs prepared in N2 atmosphere were much higher than those prepared in air (the details of fabrication of electrodes and cells are summarized in the ESI†). For convenience, the SnO2 and Nb2O5 CEs prepared in N2 atmosphere are denoted as N2-SnO2, N2-Nb2O5, and the SnO2 and Nb2O5 CEs prepared in air are denoted as Air-SnO2 and Air-Nb2O5. As shown in Fig. 1, the DSCs using Air-SnO2 and Air-Nb2O5 show PCEs of 1.84% and 0.97%. This means that the SnO2 and Nb2O5 CEs prepared in air can not be used as eligible catalysts for DSCs. In contrast, the SnO2 and Nb2O5 CEs prepared in N2 produce high catalytic activity, and the DSCs yield PCEs of 6.09% (N2-SnO2) and 4.65% (N2-Nb2O5), giving improvements of 231% and 379%, respectively. Aside from PCE, the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) are all enhanced remarkably, and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). Thus, we can say that the sinter atmosphere is significant for preparing oxide CEs; the chemical and physical properties of the oxide CEs prepared in N2 and air are evidently distinct.

To confirm the high catalytic activity of the oxide CEs prepared in N2 atmosphere, we used N2-SnO2 and Air-SnO2 to do a series of characterizations, such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), SEM, XPS, and IR. Fig. 2 shows the EIS Nyquist plots of the symmetrical cells based on N2-SnO2 and Air-SnO2 electrodes. In the plots, the series resistance (Rs) can be assigned to the impedance at a high frequency where the phase is zero. The right arc can be assigned to the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN) of the redox couples in the electrolyte, while the left one can be assigned to the charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the electrode/electrolyte interface.17 There is no discernible difference on the Rs for N2-SnO2 and Air-SnO2, and the Rs values are 14.9 and 15.5 Ω, respectively. The Rct value for the Air-SnO2 electrode is 371.2 Ω. In contrast, the Rct value for N2-SnO2 is only 32.8 Ω, much smaller than that for the Air-SnO2. Moreover, the ZN value for the N2-SnO2 is smaller than that of the Air-SnO2, indicating a large diffusion velocity of the redox couples.18 These EIS results demonstrate that N2-SnO2 behaves better than Air-SnO2 as a CE catalyst for the reduction of I3−. The difference on Rct and ZN is the major cause behind the variance in the catalytic activity of the SnO2 CEs prepared in different atmosphere. Similarly to SnO2, the EIS parameters of the Nb2O5 electrode prepared in N2 atmosphere are all lower than those of the Nb2O5 electrode prepared in air, and the Nyquist plot of the Nb2O5 electrodes is listed in the ESI (Fig. S1, ESI†).

With the exception of catalytic activity, Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows that there are no visible differences between the SnO2 sintered in air and N2 atmosphere, according to XRD and SEM characterization. This indicates that the catalytic activity variation is caused by the surface chemical and physical properties of the oxides. The IR measurement (Fig. 3) shows that the transmittance of the N2-SnO2 is improved compared to the Air-SnO2. Compared with the Air-SnO2 electrode, the spectra of N2-SnO2 give four new peaks at 1380, 3740, 2360, and 3850 cm−1. There are many factors behind this finding, such as microstructure difference, surface roughness, and electrochemical properties.19 This may be ascribed to the microstructure change of the SnO2 surface and absorption of N2 on SnO2 surface, resulting in electronic structure change and leading to different catalytic activities.

To check the surface electronic structure of the SnO2 sintered in N2 and air atmosphere, XPS measurements were carried out. Fig. 4a shows the Sn 3d data of the SnO2 which indicate significant difference on the chemical states in different sintering gases. Compared with the N2-SnO2, it can be found that the Sn 3d peak in air clearly shifts to the higher binding-energy side. Fig. 4b and c give the O 1s curve which can be decomposed into three components at the binding energies of 531.5 ± 0.3 eV, 529.8 ± 0.3 eV, and 529.0 ± 0.3 eV denoted as O531.5, O529.8, and O529.3. As pointed out in previous work, the O531.5 originates from the surface oxygen or the absorbed water and the O529.8 and O529.3 arise from the lattice oxygen in the oxides.20,21 It can be noted that the chemical states of the three components for N2-SnO2 are lower than those of Air-SnO2. Based on the analysis of the XPS results, the N2-SnO2 and Air-SnO2 exhibit widely different surface electronic structures which lead to catalytic activity variation. However, up till now, there is no systematic theoretical research on the SnO2 for the redox couple regeneration in DSCs. It is exigent to develop fundamental research which is helpful to design highly performing oxide catalysts.

In a word, the catalytic behavior of the SnO2 and Nb2O5 CEs prepared in N2 is enhanced significantly, widely different from those prepared in air. In our previous research, we found that some oxides could be used as both photoanode semiconductors and CE catalysts.16 For the oxides prepared in air, they are propitious to be used in photoanodes. On the contrary, for the oxides prepared in N2 atmosphere, they are propitious to be used in CEs, because of the auto catalytic factor leading to a large recombination and efficiency loss. By this token, the sintering atmosphere should be taken into account in the preparation of CEs and photoanode semiconductor films.
