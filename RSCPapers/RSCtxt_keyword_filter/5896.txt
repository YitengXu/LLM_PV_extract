    , Accepted 6th January 2009First published on 18th February 2009AbstractA novel isophorone sensitizer D-3 based on a donor–π–acceptor system has been conveniently synthesized for highly efficient dye-sensitized solar cells, resulting in a remarkable overall conversion efficiency of 7.41% (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) with Jsc of 18.63 mA cm−2, Voc of 634 mV and FF of 0.63.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted considerable attention as alternatives to conventional inorganic photovoltaic devices due to their high performance and low-cost of production.1–3 The classic ruthenium complexes have been reported to give a solar-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency of up to 11% under AM 1.5 irradiation with long time stability.4 However, the utilization of rare or expensive metals with substantial purification brings the major problem in cost. Additionally, to gain a satisfactory efficiency, a thick TiO2 film consisting of double layers was needed for ruthenium dyes due to their relatively low molar extinction coefficients. Therefore, more and more attention has been directed to the application of metal-free organic dyes in DSSCs.5
Most efficient metal-free organic sensitizers are D–π–A systems, constituted by donor, π-conjugation linker and acceptor moieties. The donor groups can not only affect absorption spectra but also adjust the energy levels of sensitizers. Therefore, choosing a suitable donor group in the D–π–A system is very critical to balance between photovoltage, driving forces and spectral response for future preparation of high efficiency dyes.6 For red-shifting the maximum absorption band to the longer wavelength, the introduction of π-conjugated ring units between the donor and acceptor can expand efficiently the conjugation system. However, large π-conjugated systems simultaneously brings about stronger intermolecular π–π interaction, which leads to unfavorable π-stacked dye aggregation on TiO2.7 Generally, close π-stacked aggregation would lead to inefficient electron injection resulting in low power conversion efficiency due to the formation of excited triplet states.3b Besides co-adsorbed materials such as deoxycholic acid (DCA), structural modification with steric groups is also an effective method to suppress the dye aggregation tendency. For instance, the highly steric para-bis-substituted aniline (so-called julolidine unit) was successfully incorporated into the highly efficient NKX series of sensitizers based on coumarin derivatives.2a Hara et al. found that the incorporated alkyl chains linked to the oligothiophene moiety could reduce π-stacked aggregation and block charge recombination efficiently.2b More recently, we have utilized the nonplanar, versatile, derivatable and well-defined starburst triarylamine unit to bring about superior performance in terms of aggregation resistance.5h However, there is still much room to take further insight into the interfacial engineering via molecular design, especially for developing highly efficient metal-free organic sensitizers.2b
With this in mind, we have chosen the isophorone unit as the π-cyclohexene bridge to develop a new isophoronedyeD-3 (Fig. 1) and two reference dyesD-1 and D-2, in which the indoline, dimethylphenylamine and triphenylamine units are acting as electron donors, respectively. In the typical D–π–A system, the commercially available isophorone is employed to provide conjugation between the donor and the anchoring groups. They were synthesized with the traditional Knoevenagel reaction in relatively high yield (ESI† ) instead of multi-step Suzuki reaction applied in most other organic dyes.2a,5a,g It is noteworthy that the synthesis of D-3 was quite straightforward and capable of scale-up since the intermediate of indoline-substituted aldehyde was also easily obtained.5i Actually in our pilot plant, we have successfully scaled the preparation of the indoline-substituted aldehyde up to hundred kilograms.
 Fig. 1  Chemical structures of D-1, D-2 and D-3. 

Fig. 2(a) shows the absorption spectra of the dyes in acetonitrile. Absorption peaks (λmax) were observed in visible region at 464, 450 and 497 nm, respectively (Table S1, ESI† ). Compared with D-1 and D-2, the introduction of an indoline unit as the donor could obviously favor light harvesting in DSSCs since λmax is red-shifted to 497 nm and the absorption spectrum is broadened in the visible region. The molar extinction coefficient at λmax of D-3 is determined to be 3.76 × 104 M−1 cm−1, which is about 1.15 times the corresponding value of D-1 (3.27 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 464 nm) and 1.39 times that of D-2 (2.69 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 450 nm) in the visible region. In comparison with N719 (1.47 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 535 nm, Fig. S1, ESI† ),4bD-3 shows superior properties. After anchoring on TiO2 (Fig. 2(b)), the λmax of the three dyes were slightly blue-shifted. Meanwhile, the absorption threshold was red shifted by more than 50 nm from about 650 nm to longer than 700 nm due to the interaction between the carboxylate group and TiO2.4a

The LUMO levels of three dyes anchored on TiO2 film lie in the order D-2 > D-1 > D-3, and determined to be −0.71, −0.84 and −0.85 V vs. NHE (Fig. S2, Table S2, ESI† ), respectively, which were more negative than the conduction-band (CB) edge of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE),8 ensuring the excited electrons injection into the CB was thermodynamically favorable. It is noteworthy that compared with D-1 and D-2, D-3 showed a more negative LUMO level. As expected, the more negative LUMO level is preferable in that a larger energy gap between the LUMO and the CB will result in a larger possibility of electronic injection into CB of TiO2. The orbital energies were also calculated by hybrid density functional theory (B3LYP) with 6-31G* basis set as implemented in the Gaussian 03 program.9 The calculated LUMO energies for D-1, D-2 and D-3 are −2.15, −1.98 and −2.16 V (Fig. S3, Table S2, ESI† ), respectively, which lie in the same order as the experimental results.
In order to study the aggregation effect on TiO2, the I–V curves of D-3 with and without DCA were measured (Fig. S4, ESI† ). After adding 1.0 mM DCA to an acetonitrile solution of D-3 (0.3 mM), the photocurrent was sharply decreased by about 25% from 14.76 to 11.07 mA cm−2, indicating that there was no significant π-aggregation with D-3 on the surface of TiO2 film due to its twisted structure arising from the indoline unit and isophorone segment. The non-planar ground state geometry of D-3 in vacuum (Fig. S5, ESI† ) accounts for its aggregation resistant behavior. The five-membered ring in the indoline segment was severely twisted and tilted out the main molecular plane as evidenced by the torsion angles C14–C46–C48–C50 (145.5°), C17–C14–C46–C48 (73.0°) and C12–N11–C45–C47 (127.0°). Moreover, two methyl groups in the isophorone moiety also add to the steric hindrance of the molecule. These structural features are all beneficial to prevent close π–π aggregation.
To scrutinize and optimize the thickness effect of TiO2 film on photovoltaic performances of D-3, we have fabricated dozens of cells employing single layer nanocrystalline TiO2 with various thickness (2.2, 3.4, 3.8, 5.0 and 6.7 μm) as electrodes. As illustrated in Fig. S6 (ESI† ), the resulting fill factor (FF) remained constant for all cells. As the thickness of TiO2 film went from 2.2 to 5.0 μm, the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) was increased continuously from 11.19 mA cm−2 to a plateau value of 18.63 mA cm−2. Conversely, the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) was decreased while changing the film thickness from 3.4 to 6.7 μm due to the augmentation of TiO2 surface area which provides larger possibility for charge-recombination .10 Moreover, for thick films, owing to the filtering of light by the dyed particles located close to the FTO glass, the dyed particles of outer layer did not contribute to the photogeneration of conduction-band electrons significantly. The sharing of photo-injected conduction-band electrons by these particles lowers their quasi-Fermi level, thus decreasing the Voc.5c Due to the contrary tendency of Jsc and Voc, the overall solar-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency (η) reached a maximum value of 7.41% at 5.0 μm.
The IPCE action spectra of DSSCs sensitized by the three dyes and by N719 without light scattering layer on TiO2 electrode are presented in Fig. 3. Due to high LHE in a broad region, the IPCE value of D-3 was higher than those of D-1 and D-2 in the whole action spectrum and exceeds 80% in the range of 430–630 nm, reaching its maximum of 89% at 508 nm, which is higher than that of N719. Here the integrated Jsc from IPCE was matchable with the obtained value (18.63 mA cm−2) from the I–V measurement.

To further elucidate the performance of DSSCs, we compared I–V curves of solar cells sensitized with D-1, D-2, D-3 and N719. The results under illumination of AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2) simulated solar light are shown in Fig. 4 (Table S4, ESI† ). The cell sensitized by D-3 produced the best results among the three isophoronedyes and even better than N719, with Jsc of 18.63 mA cm−2, Voc of 634 mV, FF of 0.63 and an overall conversion efficiency η of 7.41%. Under the same conditions, the corresponding values for N719 were 15.60 mA cm−2 and 7.03%, respectively.

In summary, the photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of three isophoronedyes with structural modification of the donor group in the D–π–A system were studied. Notably, the molecular design of sensitizer D-3 is successful in terms of absorption properties, LUMO level and π-stacked aggregation prevention, and consequently resulted in a remarkable overall conversion efficiency of 7.41%. With a novel simple structure, potential scale-up preparation and high efficiency on thin TiO2 films, D-3 is a very promising candidate used in solid-state DSSCs for practical application.
