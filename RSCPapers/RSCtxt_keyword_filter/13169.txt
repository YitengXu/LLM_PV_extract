1 Introduction
Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), first proposed by Förster in 1948,1 is therefore also known as the Förster energy transfer. FRET is a weakly coupled and incoherent process that describes the energy transfer between the donor and acceptor.2 The donor molecule is excited to an excited state; then, when FRET occurs, the donor molecule transfers energy to the acceptor molecule through non-radiative dipole-dipole coupling.3,4 In recent years, FRET has attracted considerable attention owing to its promising applications in biomolecular structure and dynamics,5 biosensing,6 chemical sensing,7 single-molecule experiments,8 photosynthesis,9 and photovoltaics.10
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have the advantages of light harvesting, comprehensive material sources, flexible and translucent devices, etc., and they have become a new energy technology with prospects for various applications.11–13 OSCs are usually prepared from a mixture of donor and acceptor materials. In early studies, non-fullerene receptor materials were ignored because of their low efficiency, but until 2015, Zhang et al.14 reported a high-cratered non-fullerene acceptor with benzothiophene as the core and dicyan indention as the end group. Hou et al. blended ITIC with a broad-band donor PBDBT-T, and the efficiency of their organic photovoltaic cell device can reach 11.2%, indicating that the non-fullerene acceptor's development prospect is better than that of the fullerene acceptor.15–18 In 2019, Zou et al.19 designed and developed a new non-fullerene acceptor named Y-series non-fullerene acceptors, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSC devices using Y6 as the receptor material and PM6 as the polymer donor material exceeded 16%, advancing the study of non-fullerene receptors.20 It has been reported that FRET can significantly enhance light capture and photocurrent generation in solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells21,22 because the donor molecule transfers energy to the acceptor molecule through non-radiative dipole-dipole coupling.21 Resonant energy transfer (RET) can provide complementary strategies for light harvesting in solid-state photovoltaic devices.8 FRET is widely used in photoelectric materials and rainbow solar cells,23–31 where RET can significantly improve photocurrent efficiency.26 Subramani et al. experimentally reported that the PCE performance of OSCs could be significantly improved by an efficient FRET technique.27 Sun theoretically confirmed the FRET contribution to OSCs using two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) visualization methods.28 The energy transfer was reported in ternary organic solar cells or layer-by-layer solar cells to improve the exciton utilization efficiency.29–31 The donor molecule transfers energy to the acceptor molecule through non-radiative dipole-dipole coupling in FRET. FRET can decrease the recombination of electron-hole in the donor's fluorescence and enhance the acceptor's fluorescence.
In binary organic solar cells, intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) may also be the key dynamic process between donor and acceptor molecules for achieving exciton dissociation. Zong et al. experimentally reported a FRET-based, highly efficient rate of photoinduced ICT in OSCs.32,33 Eichberger experimentally confirmed both FRET and ICT contributions to OSCs.34 The energy transfer or charge transfer may occur between the donor and acceptor, in which one is the major process dependent on the energy level and intermolecular distance or compatibility of the used materials. FRET can transfer the fluorescence energy of the donor to the absorption of the acceptor through non-radiative dipole-dipole coupling. In this process, the recombination of the electron-hole in the donor has been significantly suppressed because the fluorescence of the donor is significantly decreased by FRET. Furthermore, the absorption of the acceptor is significantly increased by FRET, which can promote electron-hole separation in the acceptor.
For the charge transfer, the Marcus equation can be written as follows:35 (1)where kB is the Boltzmann constant, h is the Planck constant, T is temperature, λ is reorganization energy, λ = λi+ λo, where λi and λo are inner and outer reorganization energy, respectively, and ΔG is Gibbs free energy. VDA is the electronic coupling (charge-transfer integral) between donor and acceptor, and detailed information can be seen in ESI.†
In this study, based on recent experimental reports on Y6:PM6 OSCs,19,36–45 physical mechanisms of FRET and ICT for efficient OSCs are investigated. The molecular structures of the donor and acceptor are shown in Scheme 1, where Y6 is (2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((12,13-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]thieno[2,′′3′′:4′,5′]-thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]indole-2,10-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile), and PM6 is 9′-(2,12-di-tert-butyl-5,9-dioxa-13b-boranaphtho[3,2,1-de] anthracen-7-yl)-9, 9′′-diphenyl-9H,9′H,9′′H-3,3′:6′,3′′-tercarbazole. Y6, as a non-fullerene material, is expected to replace fullerene derivatives and become a substitute acceptor material.19 Our results reveal that the highly efficient charge transfer in Y6:PM6 OSCs is based on FRET. Ultrafast transient pump-probe absorption spectroscopy and time-resolved fluorescence spectra considerably reveal and support FRET-enhanced organic solar cells. Our results enhance the understanding of the physical mechanisms of FRET and ICT and provide important implications for the design of FRET-based OSCs.

2 Methods
Y6 and PM6 were dissolved in chloroform, in which the concentration is 10−3 M in solution. The UV-vis absorption spectra were measured using a Hitachi U-3100 UV-vis spectrophotometer. A mixture solution of Y6 and PM6 with a weight ratio of 1:1 was also prepared in chloroform. In the absorption measurement of the solid films, the film samples were spin-coated onto quartz plates before being tested directly. The preparation method of the solution and film samples in the photoluminescence (PL) measurement is the same as the absorption measurement. PL spectra were collected by a spectrometer (DU420A-OE, ANDOR) with an excitation wavelength of 500 nm.
In the FRET measures, the excitation wavelength is 633 nm. Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) studies were carried out using an inverted-type laser scanning confocal microscope (Nikon, A1). The time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC, Picoquant) technique was used to count the emission photons. Exponential fittings for the obtained fluorescence decays were performed by applying the tail-fit fitting method using Symphotime software.
Ultrafast transient pump-probe absorption spectroscopy was measured with Vitara T-Legend Elite-TOPAS-Helios-EOS-Omni. The femtosecond Ti: sapphire laser system (Coherent) and the Helios pump-probe system (Ultrafast Systems) were used for ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy measurements. The regenerative-amplified Ti: sapphire laser system (Legend Elite-1K-HE, 800 nm, 25 fs, 4 mJ per pulse, and 1 kHz repetition rate) was employed as the laser source to generate pump and probe pulses. The main part of the output light pump is a tunable optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS-C) to produce pump pulses. A small part of the regenerative-amplified Ti: sapphire laser's output light was introduced into the TA spectrometer to generate the probe light. After passing through a motorized optical delay line, the 800 nm light beam was attenuated with a neutral density filter and focused on a sapphire crystal, which was used to generate white-light continuum (WLC) probe pulses with a wavelength ranging from 450 to 820 nm. The probe and pump pulses focused on the sample and overlapped with the sample. After sampling, the probe beam was collimated, focused on a high-speed fiber-coupled spectrometer and detected at a frequency of 1 KHz. A reference beam was split from the WLC to correct the pulse-to-pulse fluctuation of the WLC. Chopped by a synchronized chopper at a frequency of 500 Hz, the pump pulse was modulated such that the absorption changes were measured by comparing adjacent probe pulses with and without pump pulses. The intensity of the pump pulse used in the experiment was controlled by a variable neutral-density filter wheel. The optical path difference between the pump light and the probe light was controlled by the motorized optical delay line, which was used to obtain the relative time delay. All experiments were performed at room temperature.
All the above quantum calculations were performed using Gaussian 16 software.46 The ground-state geometries of Y6, PM6, and the Y6:PM6 binary system were optimized by density functional theory (DFT)47 with the B3LYP functional48 at a 6-31g(d) basis set, where DFT-D3 dispersion correction was added. The electronic transitions of optimized structures were calculated by time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT)49 with a long-range-corrected PBE0 (LC-PBE0) functional50 and a 6-31g(d) basis set. The long-range separation parameters of the LC-PBE0 functional were tuned for all molecules based on the procedure described in the ref. 51 and the results are shown in Table S1 in ESI.† The keyword iop(9/40 = 4) is used to output more detailed transition dipole moments. The transition density matrix (TDM) and charge different density (CDD) were employed to visually reveal the physical mechanism of the photoinduced charge transfer, which were plotted using our developed program.52
3 Results and discussion
In the case of FRET, as shown in Scheme 2, λi = 0, ΔG = ΔGD + ΔGA + ΔGD+A− ≈ EA(F) − ED(A) = EFRET, where EFRET is the energy difference between FRET, and EA(F) and ED(A) are the fluorescence energy of the acceptor and the excitation energy of the donor, respectively. Therefore, there is the largest Gibbs free energy and the smallest reorganization energy in the FRET. Thus, photoinduced charge transfer associated with FRET may be a feasible approach to improve the performance of OSC, and Eqn (1) is simplified as follows: (2)

Donor PM6 and acceptor Y6 manifested great advantages as active layers of the bulk heterojunction OSCs,19,47–53 while the physical mechanism of FRET and ICT for Efficient Y6:PM6 as active layers should be interpreted in detail. Fig. 1(a) shows the measured absorption and fluorescence spectra of Y6 and PM6. These results demonstrate their advantages as solar cells. Both the donor and acceptor exhibit excellent optical absorption in the visible range. The absorption spectra of acceptor Y6 and the fluorescence spectra of the donor PM6 overlap in the range of 650–780 nm, satisfying the occurrence condition of FRET. Owing to the conditions under which FRET occurs, where the fluorescence spectrum of one fluorescence molecule (the donor molecule) overlaps with the excitation spectrum of another fluorescence molecule (the recipient molecule), self-fluorescence attenuation of the donor fluorescence molecule occurs. This requirement is met in the study system. Therefore, we predict that there is a strong FRET effect in this D–A system. Moreover, the best optical excitation region for observing FRET ranges from 550 to 650 nm. This is because at 550–650 nm, it avoids the absorption peak of the receptor and is more consistent with the absorption peak of the donor.32 We measure the absorption properties of Y6, PM6, and their D–A complex, as shown in Fig. 1(b), which shows that there are two absorption peaks in the D–A complex. The optical absorption at 730 nm is contributed by acceptor Y6, while donor PM6 mainly contributes to the absorption at 598 nm. Fig. 1(c) significantly supports the FRET evidence with different mixture ratios of the donor and acceptor, in which the fluorescence intensity is significantly enhanced by FRET by increasing the mixture ratio of the acceptor, and the fluorescence of the donor is rapidly decreased. The lifetime of FRET shown in Fig. 1(d) reveals that the fluorescence lifetime of the donor is in the range of 3.35–3.55 nm, and the fluorescence lifetime of the donor is slightly decreased with the increase in acceptor in the mixture of D:A. Note that the wavelength region of fluorescence is 663–738 nm in the fluorescence measurement of the donor. Fig. 1(e) depicts the FRET evidence with different mixture ratios of the donor and acceptor, which agrees with the experimental results illustrated in Fig. 1(c). Ultrafast transient pump-probe absorption spectroscopy in Fig. 1(f) demonstrated that the absorption lifetime (t1) of the donor at 750 nm decreases from 5.5 to 2.0 ps with the increase in the ratio of D:A from 1:1 to 1:7. Additionally, simultaneously, the lifetime of the fluorescence lifetime of the acceptor is accordingly increased from 0.9 to 1.2 ns. To reveal the nature of the FRET, the femtosecond ultrafast transient absorption spectra for the FRET system are measured. Fig. 1(g–j) depicts the fitting experimental ultrafast transient pump-probe absorption spectroscopy of a mixture of donor and acceptor with ratios of D:A = 1:1, 1:3, 1:5 and 1:7; the experimental data were measured in solution. The lifetime of FRET was found to be in the tens of picoseconds and changed as the ratio of receptors changed.

The absorption properties of the donor and acceptor are studied, as shown in Fig. 2. We compare the experimental and calculated absorption spectra, as illustrated in Fig. 2(a and b). The calculated strong absorption peaks agree with the experimental results, corresponding to S1 at 726 nm for Y6 and at 616 nm for PM6. Note that the experimental absorption spectra of Y6 and PM6 have a non-negligible peak for S1 at a more potent excited energy, which does not occur in the theoretical calculation. This is because the calculation results consider only the electronic transition excitation of the materials, while the UV-Vis absorption spectrum observes both electron-vibration bands. The electronic transition absorption spectra of the acceptor and donor molecules are shown in Fig. 2(c and d). There is a strong absorption peak corresponding to S1 at 726 nm for the acceptor, and the oscillator strength of this excited state is f = 1.745. There is a strong absorption peak for the donor at 616 nm corresponding to S1, and the oscillator strength is f = 2.3436. Charge transfer behavior can be visualized through CDD maps. We studied the CT of the donor and acceptor in the visible region in the strong absorption excitation state, as shown in Fig. 3, where green and red represent holes and electrons, respectively. For the acceptor system, as shown in Fig. 3(a), the holes are mainly concentrated in the middle region of the molecule, while the electrons are distributed at both ends. In the donor system, electrons and holes are mainly distributed in the chain rather than in branches. However, Fig. 3 shows only the results of photoinduced charge transfer but cannot explain the electron–hole coherence, where the electrons come from and where they go to the electronic transition process. To analyze the electron-hole coherence of donor and acceptor systems, transition density matrix results are required.

The absorption spectrum of the D–A complex is studied, as shown in Fig. 4. We compare the experimental and calculated absorption spectra in Fig. 4(a), which exhibit similar curve shapes to confirm our theoretical calculations. However, there are tolerable theoretical errors for the two crucial absorption peaks, which can be attributed to the finite chain length of the donor and the difference in the environmental medium. For example, the experiment is measured in solution conditions, and the environmental medium of our theoretical calculation is selected in a vacuum. The electronic transition absorption spectrum of the D–A complex is shown in Fig. 4(b). The dominant excited states with large oscillator strength (labeled in Fig. 4(b)) are selected to investigate the photoinduced CT behavior of the Y6:PM6 D–A system.

We investigated the charge density distribution in the visible region of the D–A complex on the excited states of high oscillator strength and CT behavior through CDD map visualization, as shown in Fig. 5. It can be preliminarily observed that electrons are localized on acceptor Y6. However, there are partial hole distributions in the excited states S11, S26, S29, and S48 of Y6, demonstrating that the acceptor Y6 is an efficient light-harvesting carrier. Holes are mainly concentrated on the donor PM6, but there are a certain number of electrons in the middle of PM6, especially in excited states S8, S12, S14, and S17. The results show that the CT process is roughly the intermolecular charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor, but there are several electron aggregations on the donor, indicating that there is still localized excitation to a great extent. This phenomenon highlights the commonality of D–A OSCs, efficient light harvesting and exciton formation on the donor, and the subsequent ICT between the donor and acceptor.

We calculated the electronic transition spectra of the D–A complex system in the near-infrared region, as shown in Fig. 6. The result shows weak optical absorption in the near-infrared region with an oscillator strength of only 10−3 orders of magnitude, which is the contribution of electronic transition excited states S1, S2, S3, and S4. We study the photoinduced CT process of these excited states, as shown in Fig. 7. The CDD diagrams in Fig. 7(a)–(d) show that electrons are mainly concentrated on acceptor Y6 and holes are mainly concentrated on donor PM6. This indicates that the electron transition process is the charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor, and PM6 is an effective electron donor in this D–A system. The electron-hole coherence is demonstrated in Fig. 7(e)–(h), exhibiting typical charge transfer excitation with large delocalization. Generally, effective intermolecular charge transfer is significant for D–A solar cell materials. Furthermore, the system has a near-infrared absorption response at more than 1000 nm and can theoretically promote the PCE of the current OSCs. Some weak charges transfer excited states (S1, S2, S3, S4) between these absorption peaks, where electrons are transferred from the donor to the acceptor, as shown in Fig. 7(a–d). Thus, there is a photoinduced intermolecular charge transfer in FRET. Fig. 1(b) shows the new absorption band in the presence of the receptor, indicating the formation of a ground state complex between the donor and the acceptor. Fig. 6 and 7 significantly support our proposal that the potential energy surface of D+A− is lower than that of DA* in Scheme 2. Thus, fluorescence resonance can provide a barrier free charge transfer for the system owing to the FRET effect, thus increasing the charge transfer efficiency and improving the conversion efficiency of organic solar cells.

4. Conclusion
In summary, we proposed the physical mechanisms of FRET- and ICT-based OSCs. Our experimental and theoretical results reveal that the high efficiency of PM6:Y6 OSCs is a benefit of FRET without inner reorganization energy. FRET decreases the recombination of electron-hole in the donor's fluorescence and enhances the acceptor's fluorescence. Furthermore, ICT plays an important role in PM6:Y6 OSCs. Our research contributes to a better understanding of FRET and ICT and provides valuable references for the rational design of FRET- and ICT-based OSCs. Plasmon-enhancement FRET and ICT for Efficient Y6:PM6 as the bulk heterojunction active layers can be performed in detail in future studies.
