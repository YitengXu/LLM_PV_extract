    , Accepted 19th July 2018First published on 23rd July 2018AbstractThe performance of flexible perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is largely lower than that of their glass/ITO counterparts. This is mainly due to the fact that the surface of PET/ITO is rougher than glass/ITO. ITO bulges could cause the upper perovskite crystals to deteriorate, eventually leading to a large leakage current and the low performance of devices. We reduce the leakage current of PET/ITO assembled PSCs by two measures to improve the PCE of the flexible PSCs. First, double hole transport layers of PEDOT:PSS/NiO are deposited on the surface of PET/ITO, that is, a layer of PEDOT:PSS film is first spin-coated on the ITO surface and then a layer of NiO film is evaporated above to cover the small bulges on the bare ITO. Second, the dual additives of DIO and H2O were introduced to the perovskite precursor solution to control the process of crystal formation and grain growth of the perovskite absorber, finally improving the uniformity and sizes of the perovskite crystals. In conclusion, the double hole transport layers and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskites with dual additives produced a perovskite film with low roughness, high uniformity and large crystal grains on PET/ITO, finally achieving flexible PSCs with the best PCE of 18.0% and excellent flexibility. Our approach provides an effective pathway to fabricate highly efficient and large-scale flexible PSCs.
1. Introduction
Flexible solar cells which are portable, lightweight and have broad applications are widely used in the fields of wearable electronic fabrics, flexible displays, mobile power supply equipment, deformable sensors and so on. Growing attention has been paid to flexible solar cells over the past years. Organic–inorganic halide perovskites1–4 are an ideal material for the fabrication of flexible solar cells due to their low temperature solution processing ability, strong light absorption and long carrier transport lengths.5–8 Since the first model with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.4% was released by Snaith et al. in 2013,9 significant progress has been made and the PCEs of flexible PSCs have reached 17.96%.10
Flexible PSCs11–19 can be divided into two types of device structures, which are denoted n–i–p20–25 and p–i–n,25–31 where n–i–p refers to a structure of electron transport layer/perovskite layer/hole transport layer, and p–i–n refers to a structure of hole transport layer/perovskite layer/electron transport layer. The n–i–p configuration is a traditional perovskite solar cell structure, and such a PSC structure usually yields higher PCEs. However, a dense high-temperature (450–500 °C) processed TiO2 layer is often included as the electron transport layer to realize optimal device performance. On the other hand, the PET substrate for flexible PSCs cannot withstand temperatures of more than 150 °C. Thus, the n–i–p structure is not suitable for flexible PSCs.
P–i–n structured perovskite solar cells are suitable for the use of PET/ITO transparent electrode to produce flexible devices, but the performance of these flexible devices is largely lower than that of their glass/ITO counterparts. This is mainly due to the fact that the surface of PET/ITO is rougher than glass/ITO, resulting in incomplete cover of the surface bulges of PET/ITO by the PEDOT:PSS solution. Furthermore, the bulges could cause the upper perovskite crystals to deteriorate, eventually leading to a large leakage current and the low performance of devices.
In other articles, different types of hole transport layers have also been used, such as V2O5,32 TS-CuPc,33 perylene,34 GeO2,35etc.
Herein, we reduce the leakage current of PET/ITO assembled perovskite solar cells by two measures to improve the conversion efficiency of these flexible perovskite solar cells. First, the double hole transport layer PEDOT:PSS/NiO is deposited on the surface of PET/ITO, that is, a layer of PEDOT:PSS film is first spin-coated on the ITO surface and then a layer of NiO film is evaporated above to cover the small bulges on the bare ITO. Second, dual additives were introduced to the perovskite precursor solution to control the process of crystal formation and grain growth of the perovskite absorber, finally improving the uniformity and sizes of the perovskite crystals. Through the combination of the composite additives of DIO36,37 and H2O38 and the double hole transport layer of PEDOT:PSS/NiO, a perovskite film with low roughness, high uniformity and large crystal grains could be obtained and the best PCE of 18.0% has been realized in a flexible PSC.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Perovskite precursor solution preparation

Fig. 1 shows the process used to prepare the perovskite precursor solution with the dual additives method. First, MAI (Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp.), PbI2 (Aldrich) and PbCl2 (Alfa) powder were mixed in anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF, Aladdin) with a molar ratio of 4:1:1. Then the low boiling point solvent H2O (deionized water, resistivity: 18 MΩ cm) was added in different proportions and reacted at room temperature for 12 h. Afterward, the high boiling point solvent DIO (TCI) was added in a 2 wt% proportion. Finally, a perovskite precursor solution (41.5 wt%) was obtained after reaction at 60 °C for 0.5 h and was filtered with 0.45 μm PVDF filters before device fabrication.
 Fig. 1  Process flow chart of the preparation of the perovskite precursor solution with dual additives. 
2.2. Device fabrication
Flexible devices were fabricated with the structure PET/ITO/PEDOT:PSS (35 nm)/NiO (0, 5, 10 or 15 nm)/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx (450 nm)/PC61BM (30 nm)/TIPD (10 nm)/Al (110 nm). The PET/ITO (25 Ω □−1, Zhuhai Kaivo Optoelectronic Technology Co., Ltd) was cleaned stepwise in water, alcohol, acetone and isopropanol under sonication for 10 min for each and exposed to ultraviolet ozone (UVO) irradiation for 20 min. The PEDOT:PSS (PH 1000) solution was spin-coated on PET/ITO at a rate of 3500 rpm and annealed at 105 °C for 5 min. NiO was sequentially thermally evaporated at a pressure of ca. 3 × 10−4 Pa onto the PEDOT:PSS layer. Then, the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx solution with or without dual additives (DIO and H2O) was spin-coated at 6000 rpm and annealed at 100 °C for 60 min on top of the NiO layer. Afterward, the PC61BM (20 mg ml−1 in chloroform) and TIPD (4 wt% in isopropyl alcohol) were sequentially deposited by spin coating at 1500 rpm for 60 s and 4000 rpm for 60 s, respectively. Finally, Al was sequentially thermally evaporated at a pressure of ca. 3 × 10−4 Pa onto the TIPD layer. The device area, defined through a shadow mask, was 0.04 cm2.
2.3. Characterization of flexible PSCs and thin films
The J–V characteristics of the devices were measured using a Keithley 2400 source measure unit. The photocurrent response was obtained under 1 sun, AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) from a solar simulator (SAN-EI XES-502S) with a Xe lamp. The simulator illumination intensity was calibrated using a monocrystalline silicon reference cell by ISE CalLab Fraunhofer. For the J–V hysteresis measurements with respect to the scan rate and direction, the reverse scan rate was set to 100–1000 ms/2 mV. Absorption spectra were measured using a UV-vis spectrometer (Hitachi U-3000). XRD spectra were used to measure the crystallization of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx thin film by Bruker D8 ADVANCE XRD. The variation of the morphology was characterized using JEOL JSM-7500F(10 kV) scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM, Agilent 5500). The thicknesses of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx thin film and buffer layers were measured by Stylus Profiler (Dektak 150).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Effect of the double hole transport layers on the performance of flexible PSCs

Fig. 2 shows the device structure and the energy level alignments as well as the molecular structures of PET, a-TIPD and PC61BM. In order to highlight the effect of the hole transport layer structure on the photoelectric properties of flexible PSCs, the effects of flattening the ITO surface by spin-coating PEDOT:PSS and covering the small bulges of ITO with a thin layer of evaporated NiO were incorporated. As such, the high conductivity of PEDOT:PSS and the appropriate hole transport ability of NiO function at the same time. In this work, the effects of PEDOT:PSS/NiO and PEDOT:PSS on the properties of PSC devices have been compared. By optimizing the thickness of the NiO layer, the PCE of the flexible PSCs increased from 11.9% to 17.6%.

3.1.1. Effect of the thickness of the NiO layer on the transmittance of the double hole transport layers. 
The effects of the NiO layer with different thicknesses (5 nm, 10 nm and 15 nm) on the transmittance of PET/ITO/PEDOT:PSS were studied. Transmittance spectra with 5 nm, 10 nm and 15 nm NiO layers were tested by UV-vis spectroscopy and are shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen that when the NiO layer was deposited on the surface of PET/ITO/PEDOT:PSS, the spectral profiles remained almost the same, that is, they were unchanged between 350–450 nm, they slightly fluctuated in the wavelength region of 450–700 nm, and slightly declined in the range of 700–800 nm. Therefore, the deposition of 5 nm, 10 nm and 15 nm NiO layers on the surface of the PET/ITO/PEDOT:PSS layer has little effect on the light transmittance.

3.1.2. Effect of the thickness of the NiO layer on the morphology of the perovskite absorbing layer. 
The effect of the NiO layer with different thicknesses on the surface morphology of the perovskite absorber was evaluated by SEM. As shown in Fig. 4, the perovskite film obtained after the deposition of the NiO layer was uniform and compact, and the size was regular. The crystal quality of the perovskite film on PEDOT:PSS/NiO is better than that without the deposition of a NiO layer. The reasons for this may be that the roughness of ITO on PET was further reduced and the perovskite precursor solution was formed on the surface of NiO layer with smooth, uniform and dense surface defects. When the NiO layer thickness was 10 nm, the morphology of the obtained perovskite film was best, as shown in Fig. 4c.

3.1.3. Effect of the hole transport layer on the roughness of the perovskite absorbing layer. 
To examine the effect of the hole transport layer on the roughness of the perovskite absorbing layer, first the AFM images of PET/ITO and PET/ITO/PEDOT:PSS(35 nm)/NiO(10 nm) in Fig. 5a and b were characterized, the rms were 49.7 nm and 3.62 nm, respectively. Perovskite films deposited on PET/ITO, PET/ITO/PEDOT:PSS(35 nm) and PET/ITO/PEDOT:PSS(35 nm)/NiO(10 nm) were prepared, respectively, and the surface topography was probed by AFM (Fig. 6a–c). As shown in Fig. 6a, when the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx film was directly deposited on the PET/ITO surface, the roughness was very large and the rms was 41.7 nm, When the PET/ITO surface was modified by PEDOT:PSS (Fig. 4a), the roughness was significantly reduced and the rms was 9.65 nm (Fig. 6b). When the surface of PET/ITO/PEDOT:PSS was further modified by a thin layer of NiO (Fig. 4c), the surface roughness of the perovskite film was significantly reduced to 1.52 nm (Fig. 6c). These results indicate that the surface of single ITO deposited on PET is rather rough, depositing a thin layer of PEDOT:PSS can flatten the rough ITO surface to some extent, and further modifying the PEDOT:PSS surface with a thin layer of NiO provides a favorable smooth surface that could be used to induce high quality perovskite crystals.

3.1.4. Effect of the thickness of the NiO layer on the photovoltaic properties of the flexible PSCs. 
Based on the results mentioned above, the effect of the NiO layer with different thicknesses on the photovoltaic properties of flexible PSCs was studied. The device structure was PET/ITO/PEDOT:PSS (35 nm)/NiO (0, 5, 10 or 15 nm)/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx (450 nm)/PC61BM (30 nm)/TIPD (10 nm)/Al (110 nm). The photovoltaic properties of flexible PSCs with different thicknesses of NiO were tested under the illumination of AM 1.5G and 100 mW cm−2, respectively. The J–V characteristic curves are shown in Fig. 7, and the test data are shown in Table 1. The performance of the cells gets better gradually with increasing the thickness of the NiO layer from 0 nm to 10 nm. For the condition with 10 nm NiO, optimal results were obtained: a Jsc of 22.9 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.965 V, a FF of 75.7%, a PCE of 16.7%, and MPP PCE of 16.6%. These results should be attributed to the fact that uniform dense and defect-free CH3NH3PbI3−xClx (Fig. 4b and c) could be obtained due to the covering and flattening effects of NiO in combination with PEDOT:PSS, which would reduce the leakage current of flexible PSCs to improve FF significantly. When the thickness of the NiO layer increases from 10 nm to 15 nm, the morphology and roughness of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx film remained almost unchanged, and the Jsc and Voc were similar. However, the increase in thickness led some of the holes in the PEDOT:PSS/NiO double hole transport layers into recombination before reaching the ITO electrode due to the lengthened transport distance, giving rise to the reduced FF. In this paper, the NiO of the PEDOT:PSS surface was used to form a double layer hole transport layer and the thickness of NiO was optimized. The PCE of the flexible PSCs was increased from 11.3% to 16.7% and the improvement rate was 47.8%. From the MPP, it can also be concluded that the PSC efficiency increases by 45.6% with the increase in thickness of NiO from 0 nm to 10 nm.

3.2. Effect of the dual additives on the performance of the flexible PSCs
After understanding the roles of PEDOT:PSS (35 nm)/NiO (10 nm), the formula of the perovskite precursor solution was further optimized to regulate the nucleation, crystallization and growth process of the perovskite film. Previously, the additive DIO (2 wt%)37 was introduced into the main solvent of the perovskite precursor solution. Since the boiling point of DIO is considerably higher than that of the main solvent DMF, DIO evaporates later than DMF in the process of perovskite drying. Therefore, DIO addition can play a role in extending the growth time of perovskite crystallization, but not control the rate of perovskite nucleation. Correspondingly, smaller perovskite grain sizes and the mass grain boundary would combine to cause the leakage current and device properties to deteriorate.
In view of the above problems, this work proposes a method to improve the quality of the perovskite absorption layer by adding dual additives in the perovskite precursor solution. A solvent formula with low, medium and high boiling points was designed. Adding a composite additive (low boiling point: H2O; high boiling point: DIO) in DMF can induce a gradient evaporative drying process that can be used to tune the nucleation, crystallization and growth process of perovskite film.

3.2.1. Effect of H2O addition on the morphology of the perovskite films. 
Based on the proposed dual additives of DIO and H2O, and the pre-optimized DIO addition of 2 wt%,37 the addition of H2O was optimized. The effects of the amount of H2O on the morphology of perovskite films were studied. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by adding 1 vt%, 2 vt% and 3 vt% of H2O into the perovskite solution. Depositing on the NiO surface and subsequent annealing led to the formation of the perovskite film. The microstructures of the perovskite films using different amounts of H2O were observed by SEM. As shown in Fig. 8, the grain size of the perovskite films (Fig. 8b–d) with the addition of the dual additives (2 wt% DIO + H2O) was significantly larger than that with the addition of a single DIO additive (Fig. 8a). Due to the gradient boiling points of the additives and the main solvent, H2O volatilizes prior to DMF to promote the crystallization nucleation process of the perovskite, DIO volatilizes after DMF, the growth of the perovskite grains in the film was tuned to form a perovskite film with uniform, dense and large grains. When the addition amounts of H2O increased from 1 vt% to 2 vt%, the morphology of the perovskite film was best. When the water content increased to 3 vt%, the grains of the perovskite film increased and the defects also increased, as shown in Fig. 8d. Furthermore, the H2O in the dual additives could improve the interfacial energy of the perovskite film during spreading on the PEDOT:PSS surface, so there is a large change in morphology compared to the morphology without additives (Fig. 4).

3.2.2. Effect of H2O addition on the crystalline structure of the perovskite film. 

Fig. 9 shows the XRD patterns of the perovskite films prepared by adding different amounts of H2O in the perovskite precursor solution. It can be seen from Fig. 8a that the diffraction peaks of (110), (220), (330) and (440) of the perovskite crystals appear at 2θ of 14.25°, 28.5°, 43.2° and 58.8°, respectively. The four films form pure perovskite crystals. However, it can be seen from Fig. 9b that the XRD diffraction intensity of the four types of thin films is largely different, that is, the XRD diffraction intensity of the perovskite film with 2 vt% H2O is the largest, which indicates that the crystallinity of the film is highest.

3.2.3. Effect of H2O addition on the photovoltaic properties of the flexible PSCs. 
Based on the positive roles of the amount of H2O on the morphology and crystal structure of the perovskite films, the influence of the amount of H2O on the photovoltaic properties of perovskite films was investigated. The device structure was PET/ITO/PEDOT:PSS (35 nm)/NiO (10 nm)/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx (450 nm)/PC61BM (30 nm)/TIPD (10 nm)/Al (110 nm). Under the same process conditions, 64 devices of different batches were fabricated. The photovoltaic properties of the flexible PSCs were tested under the illumination of AM 1.5G and 100 mW cm−2, respectively. The J–V characteristic curve is shown in Fig. 10, and the test data are shown in Table 2. The average performance of the cells prepared with 2 wt% DIO and 2 vt% H2O as the composite additive was high. As shown in Fig. 11, an average PCE of 17.8% with a Jsc of 23.3 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.985 V, and a FF of 77.4% were achieved and the maximum PCE was 18.0% (Fig. 12). The high Jsc is related to the smooth, compact and large crystal perovskite film. The high Voc is mainly due to the pinhole-free and boundary-defect-less perovskite film. The good FF is due to the favorable interface contacts associated with low series resistance (see Table 2).

3.2.4. Effect of H2O addition on the absorption spectra and EQE of the perovskite thin films. 
In order to further confirm the effect of H2O addition on the photovoltaic properties of the perovskite thin films, the UV-vis absorption spectra and EQE of the perovskite films prepared with or without H2O addition were tested. As shown in Fig. 13, the absorption peaks of the typical perovskite materials are found in the four types of perovskite films, and the absorption spectra were consistent. However, the absorption peaks of the films obtained with the addition of 2 vt% H2O and 3 vt% H2O are significantly higher than those of the other two films in the 300–500 nm band, which is consistent with the trends of the Jsc values of the devices. As shown in Fig. 14, the EQE patterns of the four types of perovskite thin films resemble each other. However, the devices with addition of 2 vt% H2O and 3 vt% H2O exhibit significantly higher EQEs in the 300–500 nm range in comparison with the other two films. When the amount of H2O is 2 vt%, the EQEs are the highest. In summary, 2 wt% DIO and 2 vt% H2O are preferred as the dual additives for the perovskite precursor solution.

3.2.5. Mechanism analysis of the effect of the dual additives on perovskite film formation. 
The mechanism of how 2 wt% DIO and 2 vt% H2O can influence the film-forming process is proposed. As shown in Fig. 15, a 60 °C perovskite precursor solution was added dropwise to the surface of the hole transport layer, and the spin-coating was initiated after 60 seconds. The H2O in the dual additives can improve the interfacial energy of the perovskite film during spreading on the PEDOT:PSS surface. In addition, the boiling point of H2O is lower than the boiling point of DMF solvent, and H2O evaporates earlier, before the polar organic solvent. In the early stage of the film formation of the perovskites, the H2O addition would promote the homogeneous and quick nucleation. The process of spin-coating is accompanied by the volatilization of H2O and DMF, which is also the process of nucleation and film growth of the perovskite.
 Fig. 15  Mechanism of film formation of the perovskite thin films prepared by dual additives. 
The DIO additive can not only chelate with the inorganic metal, but can increase its solubility in organic solvents. In addition, the boiling point of the additive DIO is higher than the boiling point of the organic solvent DMF. During the heating and annealing process, the growth of the perovskite grains can be assisted in the film after the evaporation of DMF to produce large grain sized perovskite film.
In addition, the H2O/DIO dual additives used in this work are solvents which are completely evaporated during the annealing process and do not introduce impurities in the perovskite material. The process is also applicable to the fabrication of various structures of perovskite-based solar cells, so this proposal will be helpful for large-scale flexible models of PSCs.


3.2.6. Flexibility and stability of the flexible perovskite solar cells. 
In order to investigate device stability against the mechanical bending of the flexible PSCs, we performed a bending test during 1000 consecutive bending cycles at different radii of curvatures (Rb) of 10 mm and 5 mm. The flexible PSCs at an Rb of 10 mm exhibited no appreciable decrease in PCE, retaining their initial PCE as shown in Fig. 16. At the same time, the flexible cells at an Rb of 5 mm showed 98.3% of the initial PCE after 100 bending cycles, and the PCE decreased by approximately 8.3% compared with the initial efficiency after 1000 cycles (Fig. 16). Therefore, the observed results indicate that these flexible cells have good device stability against mechanical bending, which agrees well with the previous report adopting an ITO electrode.

Furthermore, we tested the stability of flexible PSCs at 25 °C/45% RH, the efficiency data are shown in Fig. 17. The devices were encapsulated using a high barrier film and UV curable resin under a nitrogen atmosphere. When the encapsulated flexible PSCs were stored for 60 days, the efficiency was maintained above 80%. When the encapsulated flexible PSCs were stored for 70 days, the efficiency decay rate exceeded 20%, and it dropped rapidly. Therefore, the flexible PSCs life was about 60 days.

4. Conclusions
This article selected a PEDOT:PSS (p)/perovskite (i)/PCBM (n) planar heterojunction structure that was suitable for a low-temperature solution method to prepare the perovskite solar cells. To solve the problems existing in the preparation of perovskite films on PET/ITO using a solution method, we employed high-efficiency flexible planar solar cells based on double hole transport layers and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskites with dual additives. First, the double hole transport layer PEDOT:PSS/NiO is deposited on the surface of PET/ITO, flattening the ITO surface by spin-coating PEDOT:PSS and covering the small bulges of ITO with a thin layer of evaporated NiO, by optimizing the thickness of the NiO layer, the PCE of flexible PSCs increased from 11.3% to 16.7%. Second, a solvent formula with low, medium and high boiling points was designed. Adding the dual additives of DIO and H2O in DMF can induce a gradient evaporative drying process that can be used to tune the nucleation, crystallization and growth process of the perovskite film, finally ensuring the uniformity and sizes of the perovskite crystals, with the best PCE of 18.0% with a Jsc of 23.5 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.985 V and a FF of 77.6% when measured under a reverse voltage scan. In conclusion, using the proposed technology, the prepared perovskite solar cells have favorable repeatability, high conversion efficiency and can be applicable to the preparation of large-area flexible PSCs.
