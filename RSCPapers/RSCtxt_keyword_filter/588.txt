    , Accepted 30th August 2019First published on 2nd September 2019AbstractSolar cells with a PbS quantum dot (QD) active layer are promising candidates for the next generation of low-cost and efficient solution-processed photovoltaic (PV) devices due to their direct and tunable bandgap, air stability and facile fabrication process. In fact, PbS QD PVs rely on replacing the long oleate ligands with shorter bidentate or halide-based atomic ligands that alter their energy levels with enhanced surface passivation. Such shorter organic ligands are typically sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) radiation present in the solar spectrum. Therefore, under illumination, they are prone to degradation, decomposition or detachment from the QD surface, ultimately leading to degraded PV performance. So far, the impact of UV irradiation on the PbS QD device has not been studied. Here, the impact of long durations of UV-exposure on exchanged PbS QD films was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). We employ an effective strategy to enhance the UV stability of PbS QD solar cells using a luminescence down-shifting CdSe/ZnS QD layer deposited on the back of the device structure. Moreover, we find that using this technique, the incoming UV photons that would not normally contribute to carrier generation – due to absorbance by other layers or energy thermalization in the PbS QD absorber layer – are absorbed and re-emitted at a visible wavelength leading to enhanced carrier generation. By optimizing and combining this luminescence down-shifting strategy with an ordered bulk heterojunction (OBHJ) architecture consisting of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires (NWs), UV-stable and efficient PbS QD solar cells are achieved. Our best performing device shows a record high short-circuit current density (JSC) of 33.2 mA cm−2 and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.62%.
Introduction
Lead sulfide (PbS) quantum dots (QDs) are attractive candidates for solution-based photovoltaic (PV) devices owing to their size-tunable bandgap, facile solution processing, noticeable air stability and multiple excitation generation (MEG) characteristics.1–10 Over the past few years, many studies in the field of QD PVs have been focused on the development of various strategies such as interface engineering for improving the overall device efficiency.10–16 Recently, the Sargent group developed PbS QD PVs with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12% with a record short circuit current density (JSC) of 32 mA cm−2.17 In addition, the development of rapid and facile deposition techniques such as blade/spray coating together with the employment of QD inks led to QD coatings on flexible and lightweight substrates.18–25 The fundamental characteristics of PbS QDs such as band energies, surface passivation and interdot carrier transport primarily depend on replacing the long oleate ligands with shorter bidentate molecular structures such as benzenedithiol (BDT), 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) or halide-based atomic ligands such as tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI).10,20 Such organic ligands are sensitive to high energy UV exposure especially upon extended durations of device performance under solar irradiation. Although this could potentially affect the exchanged PbS QD surface and thereby significantly alter the PV performance, the impact of extended UV radiation on short ligands employed in PbS QD fabrication remains unknown. UV photons with high energy are not efficient for carrier generation in the PbS QD absorber and can increase the bulk recombination. This is due to the fact that PbS QD PVs include an indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode coated with ZnO as an electron transport layer (ETL), which partially absorbs such high energy photons leading to their reduced absorption by the PbS QD layer and low contribution to carrier generation. The portion of UV photons that can reach the absorber layer is harmful to the short organic ligands and also does not contribute much to carrier generation due to the high energy thermalization in the absorber material. Here, we first employ X-ray electron spectroscopy (XPS) to study the impact of extended UV radiation on TBAI and EDT-exchanged PbS QD films. Then we demonstrate a light management strategy using CdSe/ZnS QDs as an energy down-shifting material to absorb high energy UV photons before reaching the absorber layer and reduce the UV-induced damage to short ligands. Moreover, we show that the application of the energy down-shifting layer, which converts the high energy UV photons to 520 nm wavelength photons, noticeably increases the short circuit current density (JSC) in the PbS QD PV and therefore can also be considered as an effective strategy to increase the JSC of the device. We further increase the current density of the PbS QD PV using a nanostructured electrode, i.e., ZnO NW array, as another light management strategy.26–30 Through optimization of the down-shifting layer thickness, significant improvement in the efficiency and stability of the device is achieved with a record high value of JSC exceeding 33 mA cm−2.
Results and discussion
To assess the impact of UV emission on TBAI and EDT ligands in PbS QD films, X-ray electron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was performed on the PbS/TBAI and PbS/EDT QD films before and after 6 h UV exposure (Experimental section). Fig. 1a shows the Pb 4f core level spectra of PbS/TBAI of the samples before and after UV exposure. A Pb 4f doublet is observed for TBAI exchanged QDs with the Pb 4f7/2 peak at ∼138.5 eV and two shoulder peaks at ∼139.5 eV and 144.3 eV (gray-shadowed peaks in Fig. 1a), which can be associated with the Pb–I bonds.31,32 For the reference sample after UV exposure, these two peaks show significant reduction in the intensity, suggesting TBAI ligand removal upon UV exposure. Fig. 1b shows the S 2p core level peaks of the EDT-exchanged PbS QD film before and after UV exposure. Comparing the XPS spectra of both films shows that the peak intensity of the EDT ligands (∼161.7 eV) is decreased and the peak intensity of the unbound thiolates (∼163.4 eV) is increased. These results confirm the adverse impact of extended UV irradiation on the short ligands on the surface of PbS QDs. To assess the UV protection of CdSe/ZnS QDs, PbS/TBAI and PbS/EDT thin films with a layer of CdSe/ZnS QD coating on the back of the substrate were prepared and the samples were exposed to UV radiation through the QD-coated side. The corresponding XPS spectra for PbS/TBAI and PbS/EDT with the CdSe/ZnS QD coating after UV radiation are shown in Fig. 1a and b. For the TBAI-exchanged sample with the CdSe/ZnS QD coating, the Pb–I bond peaks exhibit similar intensity before and after UV irradiation. Similarly, after UV radiation, the EDT-exchanged film with the CdSe/ZnS QD coating shows stronger EDT and bound thiolate peaks compared to the uncoated film. These results confirm that the energy down-shifting QD layer plays an important role in protecting the absorber layer from UV irradiation.

In order to assess the impact of incoming UV light on the performance of PbS QD PVs, six sets of PbS QD devices were fabricated and characterized before and after UV exposure. Initially, pre-patterned ITO-glass was coated with a 40 nm thick ZnO layer through a sol–gel process (see the Experimental section for details). Next, PbS QDs with the first exciton absorption peak located at 980 nm were deposited using a layer-by-layer deposition method (Fig. S1, ESI†). A solution of tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI) in methanol was employed to replace the native oleic acid ligands from the first 10 layers of PbS QDs and followed by ligand exchange of the top 2 layers using a solution of 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) in acetonitrile. Finally, an Au electrode was thermally evaporated on the top of the PbS QD layer through a shadow mask. Fig. 2a demonstrates the band alignment of the ITO, ZnO, PbS-TBAI, and PbS-EDT layers at equilibrium with conduction and valence band levels relative to vacuum. The schematic representation of the device structure and the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the device after focus ion beam (FIB) milling are shown in Fig. 2b and c, respectively.

The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the fabricated devices were measured under 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM 1.5MG illumination as shown in Fig. 3a. Next, the same device was exposed to UV light for 6 h and then the J–V characteristics were remeasured again as shown in Fig. 3a (see the Experimental section for more details). A clear degradation of the device performance is observed as a result of long UV exposure (Table 1). The VOC and fill factor (FF) reduce from 590 mV and 0.50 for the as-prepared device to 430 mV and 0.38, respectively, leading to PCE drop from 7.3% to 4.8%. Interestingly, the JSC of the device after UV illumination shows a slight increase as compared to that of the as-prepared device. We speculate that this is likely due to the enhanced carrier transport through decreased inter-dot spacing as a result of removal of UV-sensitive organic shell ligands, which we discussed below and in Fig. S2, ESI.† In order to protect the absorber layer from the incoming UV light, we coated the backside of the ITO glass with a layer of CdSe/ZnS QDs (Sigma-Aldrich) exhibiting a photoluminescence (PL) peak at 520 nm and a quantum yield of 85% (Fig. 1b). A set of six devices were made from the same batch of PbS QDs. The J–V characteristics were measured for the devices without and with the CdSe/ZnS QD layer, as shown in Fig. 3b and Table 2. Upon coating the device with CdSe/ZnS QDs, the JSC increased from 24.2 mA cm−2 to 25.3 mA cm−2 with a small increase of about 0.01 in FF and no change of VOC. This resulted in a slight improvement of PCE from 7.12% to about 7.61%, which will be discussed in the following section. To assess the UV stability of the CdSe/ZnS QD coated devices, the sample was exposed to UV light under the same conditions as discussed before and the resultant J–V curve is shown in Fig. 3b. In contrast to the unprotected sample, the CdSe/ZnS QD-coated device shows a significantly improved UV stability. The values of VOC and FF decreased by only 30 mV and 0.03 after 6 h exposure, respectively, while the JSC shows a 0.8 mA cm−2 increase leading to an overall PCE of ∼7%. Compared to the PCE drop of ∼2.5% for the unprotected device upon UV exposure, the device with the CdSe/ZnS QD layer shows only ∼0.6% PCE drop. These results clearly demonstrate the important role of CdSe/ZnS QDs as an effective UV absorber to protect the PbS QD active layer from high energy photons.

As shown in Fig. 3a, the deposition of the CdSe/ZnS QD layer on the backside of the device resulted in the improvement of PCE mainly due to the higher JSC. We attribute this to the energy down-shifting of the CdSe/ZnS QDs that absorb high energy photons and re-emit photons with lower energy at around 520 nm wavelength. In turn, in the absence of the CdSe/ZnS QD layer, the high energy photons with wavelengths of ∼300–400 nm are considerably absorbed by the ITO electrode and ZnO ETL layer before reaching the absorber layer. Moreover, significant thermalization associated with such high energy photons, even when they reach the absorber layer, results in their extremely low contribution to carrier generation. These results show that the deposition of energy down-shifting CdSe/ZnS QDs not only leads to absorption of high energy photons which provides the active layer with UV protection, but also leads to their re-emission in lower energy ranges, which are more useful for solar cells.
We note that the J–V characteristics of the PbS QD solar cells with the CdSe/ZnS QD coating show a noticeable improvement in JSC. Therefore, the optimization of the luminescence down-shifting layer is expected to further increase the value of JSC. Recently, the utilization of ZnO NW arrays or TiO2 nanopillars helped to noticeably enhance the JSC in comparison to planar PbS QD structures.33,34 In these architectures, the directions of photon absorption and charge collection are decoupled enabling effective charge extraction inside an optically dense film.30 Thus, we combine two strategies, employing ZnO NWs and energy down-shifting CdSe/ZnS QDs to improve the JSC of PbS QD PVs. We first fabricated PbS QD devices with ZnO NWs and then optimized the concentration of the CdSe/ZnS QD layer to maximize the value of JSC. To grow ZnO NWs, a 40 nm thick ZnO seed layer was first deposited on pre-patterned ITO glass by a sol–gel process (see the Experimental section for details). Then, the ZnO NWs were grown on the ZnO seed layer for 40 min at 90 °C. The PV performance of the reference ZnO NW-based PbS QD PV is shown in Fig. 4a. As expected, the ZnO NW-based devices showed a superior performance with a representative JSC of ∼31 mA cm−2 and PCE of 9.8% compared to the reference device with a JSC of ∼25 mA cm−2, as shown in Fig. 2. In order to optimize the concentration of the down shifting CdSe/ZnS QDs, three different concentrations of CdSe/ZnS QDs in toluene, i.e. 20, 40 and 60 mg mL−1, were used and coated on the back of the devices. Fig. 4a and Table S3† show the representative PV performances of the PbS QD devices with ZnO NWs and different concentrations of the energy down shifting layer. The device coated with 20 mg mL−1 concentration of CdSe/ZnS QDs exhibits a JSC of ∼32.2 mA cm−2, which is higher than the JSC of the reference cell (31 mA cm−2) and displays a PCE of 10.4%. Further increase of the CdSe/ZnS QD concentration to 40 mg mL−1 improves the value of JSC to 32.9 mA cm−2 and PCE to 10.5%. The champion device (with the highest JSC) shows a JSC of 33.2 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 10.62% (Fig. S3, ESI†). Also the distribution of PCE for the PbS QD PVs with ZnO NWs and CdSe/ZnS QD coating (40 mg mL−1) is shown in Fig. S4, ESI.† The relatively narrow variations indicate good reproducibility over the 18 fabricated devices. However, the use of 60 mg mL−1 concentration resulted in a drop in JSC and PCE to 30.7 mA cm−2 and 9.8%, respectively, likely due to the reduced optical transmittance in the shorter wavelength region. To verify the obtained photocurrent values, we performed external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements for the ZnO NW-based device without and with the CdSe/ZnS QD coating layer (40 mg mL−1), as shown in Fig. 4b. The JSC of the devices was calculated by integrating the AM1.5G spectrum with the EQE spectra. Compared to the reference device, the device with the CdSe/ZnS QD layer shows an improvement in the EQE at shorter (<400 nm) and longer wavelengths (up to ∼560 nm), which was attributed to the absorption of high energy photons and their re-emission at longer wavelengths. The JSC values from the J–V curves are roughly 1 mA cm−2 higher than those estimated from the EQE measurements due to the spectral mismatch between the spectra of the utilized solar simulator and that of AMG1.5. The cross-sectional SEM image of the device with ZnO NWs is shown in Fig. 4c. The emissions of the CdSe/ZnS QD layers with different concentrations are shown in Fig. 5a. The transmittance spectra of these films show that the CdSe/ZnS QD layer largely block UV photons and thereby protect the underneath absorber layer (Fig. 5b). The transmittance at shorter wavelengths (∼300–500 nm) is reduced when the CdSe/ZnS QD concentration increases, which explains the lower value of JSC for devices with a higher concentration of CdSe/ZnS QDs (i.e. 60 mg mL−1). Moreover, to evaluate the potential of our fabrication process for large-scale devices, we connected all the six pads on the device to achieve an active area of 0.324 cm2. As shown in Fig. S5,† our device exhibits a PCE of 10.5%, which is comparable to the PCE of small area devices.

The stability results of the PbS QD PVs with and without the CdSe/ZnS QD protective layer under continuous UV illumination for 150 h are shown in Fig. 5c. The device with the protective QD layer retains about 78% of its initial PCE after 150 h of continuous UV exposure, whereas the device without the QD protective layer retains ∼20% of its initial PCE after only 50 h. These results clearly demonstrate the positive effect of the protective CdSe/ZnS QD layer on PV device performance and stability.
Conclusion
In summary, we studied the impact of UV radiation on PbS QDs exchanged with short organic ligands and demonstrated that coating the exchanged PbS QD absorber layer with energy down-shifting CdSe/ZnS QDs could effectively protect the organic ligands leading to a significant improvement in device stability under UV exposure. Also, we showed that this layer effectively absorbs incoming high energy photons and re-emits photons at longer wavelengths, leading to improved light harvesting. By combining the addition of a CdSe/ZnS QD layer with inclusion of ZnO NWs in the device structure, we achieved remarkably high JSC and PCE values exceeding 33 mA cm−2 and 10.6%, respectively.
Experimental section
ZnO seed layer preparation and NW growth
Pre-patterned ITO substrates of 150 nm thickness (∼20 Ω □−1 sheet resistance) were cleaned by sonication in deionized (DI) water, acetone, and isopropanol and oxygen plasma treatment (PDC 32G, Harrick Plasma) for 2 min. ZnO seed layers were deposited on the pre-patterned ITO substrates by spin-coating a solution of zinc acetate dihydrate (0.3 M) and ethanolamine (0.3 M) in 2-methoxyethanol, inside a nitrogen-filled glove box followed by annealing at 220 °C for 10 min in air. We repeated this process twice. ZnO NWs were grown by placing the substrates into a growth solution with the same volumes of zinc nitrate hexahydrate (0.05 M) and hexamethylenetetramine (0.05 M) in DI water (25 mL) for 40 min at ∼90 °C. After the growth, ZnO NWs were thoroughly rinsed with DI water and dried by annealing at 100 °C for 5 min.
PbS QD device fabrication
PbS colloidal QDs capped with oleic acid – with the first exciton absorption peak in solution at ∼980 nm – were used (Sigma-Aldrich). PbS QDs were then deposited onto the ZnO/ITO/glass substrates using a layer-by-layer deposition method. A solution of PbS QDs (50 mg mL−1) in octane was spin-coated at 1500 rpm for 30 s. Each spin-coating cycle deposited ∼20–25 nm of PbS QDs. Ligand exchange of TBAI (Sigma-Aldrich) for the native oleic acid capping ligands was done by dispersing TBAI in methanol solution (10 mg mL−1) and waiting for 30 s before spin-drying. This was followed by three times rinsing with methanol. The QD deposition steps with TBAI ligand exchange were repeated for 10 layers. For the last two PbS QD deposition steps, two layers of 1,2-EDT (Sigma Aldrich) in acetonitrile with an acetonitrile rinse and spin-coating steps at 2500 rpm were used. All spin-coating steps were carried out under ambient conditions. To complete the device fabrication, a gold electrode (Kurt J. Lesker, 99.999%) was thermally evaporated through a shadow mask at a rate of 1.2 Å s−1 at a base pressure of ∼10−6 Torr. The solar cell area of the device with an Au electrode is 0.054 cm2. The CdSe/ZnS QDs were spin-coated on the backside of the completed device at 1500 rpm for 30 s.
Device characterization
Current–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured in a nitrogen-filled glovebox using a semiconductor device analyzer (Agilent Technologies, B1500A). The solar simulator illumination of 100 mW cm−2 was provided by a 150 W xenon arc-lamp (Newport 96000) with an AM1.5G filter. Prior to obtaining J–V characteristics the devices were initially light-soaked under these illumination conditions for 5 min. Optical transmittance and absorbance were recorded by using a UV-Vis/NIR spectrometer (Lambda 1050). UV-Vis spectra were measured by using a Varian Cary 5. For UV illumination, a UV lamp with 100 mW cm−2 power was used. EQE data were measured by using a 250 (W) tungsten halogen lamp source with an Oriel Cornerstone 130 monochromator. Integrated photocurrent density values were calculated by integrating the product of the EQE and the AM1.5G spectra over the wavelength range of 300–1100 nm. Prior to EQE and J–V measurements, calibration was performed using a Newport 91150V reference Si solar cell. SEM imaging was performed using a FEI Helios NanoLab 600 in immersion mode at 5 kV. The device cross section for SEM was prepared by Ga focused ion beam milling at 30 kV on the same instrument. PL spectra were recorded with a SpectraPro 300i spectrometer employing liquid nitrogen cooled InGaAs detector arrays (Princeton Instruments). For XPS measurements, an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (ESCALAB 250Xi, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA) with Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.6 eV) as a source was used.

 	Fig. 1  XPS spectra: (a) Pb 4f core level peaks of the reference sample (without the protective layer) before and after UV irradiation and the CdSe/ZnS QD-coated sample after UV irradiation showing gradual reduction of Pb–I bonds (gray-shadowed peaks) upon extended UV exposure. (b) S 2p core level peaks of the reference sample (without the protective layer) before and after UV irradiation and the CdSe/ZnS QD-coated sample after UV irradiation showing reduced levels of EDT ligands and bound thiolates upon unprotected UV exposure (blue and red peaks, respectively) leading to increased levels of unbound thiolate (green peaks).	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Schematic illustration of the band alignment of the PbS QD PV heterostructure at equilibrium with conduction and valence band levels relative to vacuum. (b) Schematic of the device architecture with the CdSe/ZnS QD layer. (c) FIB-milled cross sectional SEM image of the PbS QD PV. Scale bar is 200 nm.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Representative J–V characteristics under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G illumination for PbS QD PV devices without any protective layer before and after UV exposure. (b) J–V characteristics of the representative PbS QD devices without and with the CdSe/ZnS QD protective layer before and after UV exposure. The measurements were performed under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G illumination.
