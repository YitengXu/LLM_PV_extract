    , Accepted 26th January 2009First published on 25th February 2009AbstractA significant Au particle size-dependent electrocatalytic effect has been shown in a sandwich type photoelectrochemical solar cell consisting of CdSquantum dot (QD)-sensitized TiO2 photoelectrodes, Au nanoparticle (NP)-loaded SnO2 counter electrodes, and a polysulfide  electrolyte solution intervening between the electrodes.
Until now, Au NPs loaded on metal-oxide supports have been revealed to exhibit high catalytic activities for many important chemical reactions, whereas bulk Au is chemically inert.1,2 The most intriguing point in the catalysis of Au NPs is the strong dependence of the activity on their particle size. In thermally activated catalysis, the activities for low-temperature oxidation of carbon monoxide3 and hydrogenation of acetylene4 reach maxima when the range of the mean particle size is below 10 nm. Unique active sites5 and electronic state3 of Au NPs could cause the anomalous catalytic activity, although the origin is not fully understood. Also, we have recently found the significant Au particle size-dependence of photocatalytic activities in the Au/TiO2-photocatalyzed reductions of nitrobenzene and disulfides, resulting from the efficiency of photoinduced interfacial electron transfer from TiO2 to Au.6 However, the study of the Au particle-size effect on electrocatalysis is only limited to the oxygen reduction7 and hydrogen generation from water,8 which are of importance in connection with fuel cells. On the other hand, a great deal of attention has been focused on dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) as a sustainable energy source.9 Although organic dyes have mainly been used as the photosensitizers  in DSSC, inorganicsemiconductor  QDs have a great potential for increasing the power conversion efficiency and stability because of the multiple exciton  generation10 and robustness. Recently, Tachibana et al. have reported that the performances of a solar cell using CdSQD-loaded mesoporous TiO2 photoelectrodes (CdSQD/mp-TiO2) can be greatly improved by using a polysulfide  redox pair (Sx2−/S2−).11
Here we report the electrocatalytic effect of Au NP-loading over the SnO2 counter electrode (CE) on the performances of a photoelectrochemical solar cell consisting of the CdSQD/mp-TiO2(photoelectrode)|Sx2−/S2−(redox pair in electrolyte solution)|CE with a particular emphasis placed on the Au particle size dependence. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the electrocatalytic effect of Au NPs in photoelectrochemical solar cells. Au NPs with a mean size (d) of 6.0 nm were firstly formed on the surface of SnO2 electrodes by the deposition–precipitation (DP) method12 to be grown by successive electrolytic reduction (ER) of Au3+ ions.‡Fig. 1A–C show surface scanning electron micrographs (SEM) of Au NP-loaded SnO2 electrodes (Au/SnO2) prepared by changing the electrolytic reduction time (tr). In each sample, Au NPs are deposited on the SnO2 surface in a highly dispersed state. As shown in Fig. 1D, the loading amount and the d value of the Au NPs increase with an increase in tr. Clearly, the d can be controlled in the range from 6.0 to 15.3 nm through tr (0 < tr < 30 min) as a result of the selective Au electrodeposition on the surface of the seeds formed by the DP method.

Sandwich type photoelectrochemical solar cells (CdSQD/mp-TiO2|Sx2−/S2−|CE) were fabricated employing various CEs. The thickness of the TiO2 films was determined to be ca. 5 μm by SEM observation of the sample cross-section, and the cell gap was controlled at ca. 60 μm. CdSQDs were deposited on the surface of the mp-TiO2 film by a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction technique.13 The mp-TiO2 film was dipped in 0.1 mol dm−3 Cd(ClO4)2 aq, and subsequently in 0.1 mol dm−3 Na2S aq at room temperature, and the procedures were repeated ten times. The band gap (Eg) of the CdSQDs was determined to be 2.67 eV, which is greater than that for the bulk CdS (2.4 eV)14 due to the quantum size effect (Fig. S1 in ESI† ). The short-circuit current (Jsc/A cm−2) was measured as a function of excitation wavelength (λ/m), and the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was calculated using eqn (1). IPCE (%) = (JscNA /I F h cλ) × 100(1)where NA  is Avogadro’s constant , I (W cm−2) is the light intensity, F  is Faraday’s constant , h  is Planck’s constant , and c is the speed of light.

Fig. 2 shows the action spectra of IPCE for the CdSQD/mp-TiO2|Sx2−/S2−|CE type cell (a–g), and the electronic absorption spectrum of CdSQD/mp-TiO2 (solid line). In every cell, the IPCE steeply increases at λ < 520 nm, while the CdSQD/mp-TiO2 has absorption due to the interband transition in the same wavelength region. The good resemblance to the profiles of the IPCE action spectra indicates that CdSQDs act as a photosensitizer . The IPCE for the cell (CE = Au thin film ) is 2.5 times as large as that for the cell (CE = SnO2). Interestingly, the cell (CE = Au(d = 6.0 nm)/SnO2) provides an IPCE value even greater than that for the cell (CE = Au thin film ) by a factor of 2, and the IPCE tends to increase with decreasing d in spite of the decrease in the Au loading amount (Fig. S2 in ESI† ). A similar trend was observed for the cells replacing Au/SnO2 by Pt/SnO2, which is usually used as a CE in DSSC (Fig. S3 in ESI† ).15 Also, the IPCE values for both the cells using Au/SnO2 and Pt/SnO2 CEs were comparable.
 Fig. 2  IPCE action spectra (symbols) of the CdS/mp-TiO2|Sx2−/S2−|CE (left y-axis) and electronic absorption spectrum (solid line) of the CdS/mp-TiO2(right y-axis). The CEs are SnO2 (a), Au thin film  (b), Au (d = 6.0 nm)/SnO2 (c), Au (d = 10.4 nm)/SnO2 (d), Au (d = 11.4 nm)/SnO2 (e), Au (d = 13.8 nm)/SnO2 (f), Au (d = 15.3 nm)/SnO2 (g). 
To clarify the reason for the superior conversion efficiency in the cell (CE = Au/SnO2), the sulfur reduction currents for various electrodes were measured in the same electrolyte solution as used in the solar cell by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). Fig. 3 shows LSV curves for the reduction of Sx2− ions to S2− ions on the following electrodes:16 (a) SnO2, (b) Au thin film , (c) Au(d = 11.4 nm)/SnO2, (d) Au(d = 13.8 nm)/SnO2, (e) Au(d = 15.3 nm)/SnO2. The current per geometric area of the electrode increases in the order of SnO2 < Au thin film  < Au(d = 15.3 nm)/SnO2 < Au(d = 13.8 nm)/SnO2 < Au(d = 11.4 nm)/SnO2, which is in agreement with the order of IPCE. This finding indicates that Au NPs serve as a good electrocatalyst for the sulfur reduction, contributing to the increase in the IPCE of the solar cell. The Au particle size-dependence of the electrocatalytic activity is more clearly shown by normalizing the current to the Au surface area (Fig. S2 in ESI† ). As shown in the inset (Fig. 3), the activity significantly increases as the d value decreases.

I (mA cm−2) is the current per apparent area of the electrode. The inset shows the LSV profiles of Au (d = 11.4 nm)/SnO2 (c), Au (d = 13.8 nm)/SnO2 (d), Au (d = 15.3 nm)/SnO2 (e), where the current is normalized to the surface area of the Au NPs. The potential was scanned from rest potential to −1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl at a scan speed of 5 mV s−1. 
The redox property of S2− ions on the Au surface provides detailed information on the sulfur adsorption sites. Fig. 4 shows the LSV profiles in an electrolyte solution containing only S2− ions as a probe for the following electrodes: (a) SnO2, (b) Au thin film , (c) Au(d = 11.4 nm)/SnO2, (d) Au(d = 13.8 nm)/SnO2, (e) Au(d = 15.3 nm)/SnO2. At the rest potential, S2− ions undergo oxidative adsorption on the Au surface.17 Only a small current flows at the potential (U) < −0.55 V in curve (a). In curve (b), a sharp reduction current peak (P1) is present at −0.87 V, and hence there exists one kind of adsorption site for S2− ions on the Au thin film  surface. The comparison of the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for the Au thin film  (a) and Au particles with random orientation (b) indicates the preferential orientation of the Au(111) plane in the former sample (Fig. S4 in ESI† ). Also, Vericat et al. showed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy that S2− ions are adsorbed on the hollow sites surrounded by three Au atoms of the Au(111) plane.17 Consequently, the P1 can be attributed to the reduction of sulfur adsorbed oxidatively on the 3-fold hollow sites on the Au(111) planes of the Au thin film  surface.

I (mA cm−2) is the current per geometric area of the electrode. The inset shows the LSV profiles of Au (d = 11.4 nm)/SnO2 (c), Au (d = 13.8 nm)/SnO2 (d), Au (d = 15.3 nm)/SnO2 (e), where the current is normalized to the surface area of Au NPs. The potential was scanned from rest potential to −1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl at a scan speed of 5 mV s−1. 
On the other hand, in curves (c–e), two broad current peaks are present near −0.8 V (P2) and −0.9 V (P3). Since not observed in curve (a), they also correspond to the reduction of sulfur adsorbed on the Au NP surfaces, suggesting the presence of two kinds of the adsorption sites. In the XRD pattern of Au/SnO2, the diffraction peak from the Au(200) plane was observed. Although the peak from Au(111) overlapped with the intense peak from the SnO2(200) plane (Fig. S4 in ESI† ), Ichikawa et al. reported that Au NPs loaded on metal oxides by the DP method are polyhedrons surrounded mainly by the (111) and (100) planes.18 Also, Demir et al. observed the reduction peak of sulfur adsorbed at the 4-fold hollow sites on the Au(100) electrode at a ca. 35 mV more anodic potential than that for the Au(111) electrode.19 Thus, P2, and P3 with a potential close to that of P1 would be assigned to the reduction of sulfur weakly adsorbed on the (100) plane and strongly adsorbed on the (111) plane of Au NP surfaces, respectively, although the possibility that the edges of Au NPs are responsible for P2 can not be ruled out completely. Also, both the current peaks P2 and P3 intensify on going from d = 15 nm to d = 11 nm regardless of the decrease in the Au surface area (Fig. S3 in ESI† ). This Au particle size effect is further clear in the inset (Fig. 4), where the current is normalized to the surface area of Au NPs. The increase in P2 is probably due to the increase in the surface exposure of the Au(100) plane as the Au particle size decreases. Noticeably, the potential of P3 is more negative than that of P1, slightly shifting toward the cathodic direction on decreasing d. The increase in the adsorption strength of sulfur on the Au(111) plane with decreasing d could enhance the sulfur adsorption to increase P3.
In summary, Au NPs with varying size have been formed on SnO2 electrodes by a 2-step route consisting of deposition–precipitation followed by electrochemical reduction. The performance of CdSQD/mp-TiO2|Sx2−/S2−|CE type photoelectrochemical solar cells was greatly improved by loading Au NPs on the surface of the SnO2 CE. This study has pointed out the importance of the size and crystal orientation control of Au NPs in the electrocatalysis.
