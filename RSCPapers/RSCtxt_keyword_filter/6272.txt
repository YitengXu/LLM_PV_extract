    , Accepted 7th September 2017First published on 11th September 2017AbstractNovel approaches to boost quantum dot solar cell (QDSC) efficiencies are in demand. Herein, three strategies are used: (i) a hydrothermally synthesized TiO2–multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composite instead of conventional TiO2, (ii) a counter electrode (CE) that has not been applied to QDSCs until now, namely, tin sulfide (SnS) nanoparticles (NPs) coated over a conductive carbon (C)-fabric, and (iii) a quasi-solid-state gel electrolyte composed of S2−, an inert polymer and TiO2 nanoparticles as opposed to a polysulfide solution based hole transport layer. MWCNTs by virtue of their high electrical conductivity and suitably positioned Fermi level (below the conduction bands of TiO2 and PbS) allow fast photogenerated electron injection into the external circuit, and this is confirmed by a higher efficiency of 6.3% achieved for a TiO2–MWCNT/PbS/ZnS based (champion) cell, compared to the corresponding TiO2/PbS/ZnS based cell (4.45%). Nanoscale current map analysis of TiO2 and TiO2–MWCNTs reveals the presence of narrowly spaced highly conducting domains in the latter, which equips it with an average current carrying capability greater by a few orders of magnitude. Electron transport and recombination resistances are lower and higher respectively for the TiO2–MWCNT/PbS/ZnS cell relative to the TiO2/PbS/ZnS cell, thus leading to a high performance cell. The efficacy of SnS/C-fabric as a CE is confirmed from the higher efficiency achieved in cells with this CE compared to the C-fabric based cells. Lower charge transfer and diffusional resistances, slower photovoltage decay, high electrical conductance and lower redox potential impart high catalytic activity to the SnS/C-fabric assembly for sulfide reduction and thus endow the TiO2–MWCNT/PbS/ZnS cell with a high open circuit voltage (0.9 V) and a large short circuit current density (∼20 mA cm−2). This study attempts to unravel how simple strategies can amplify QDSC performances.
Introduction
Quantum dot solar cell (QDSC) efficiencies are at present almost as high as the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) achieved in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), greater than 11%.1 Compared to dyes in DSSCs, QDs are relatively less costly, are easy to process under non-inert conditions at low temperatures, and offer other benefits such as multiple exciton generation (the ability of a QD to produce more than one electron per impinging photon), air-stability, and panoramic solar spectrum harvesting by judicious choice of the quantum dot.1–5 QDSC technology has now reached a stage where the semiconducting oxide/QD/electrolyte and counter electrode/current collector interfaces can be carefully designed and implemented to maximize the PCEs and minimize recombination losses.
Of the various components in a QDSC, firstly, the wide band gap semiconducting scaffold (such as TiO2) can be transformed into a more efficient electron acceptor, by making a composite with an electron conducting material like multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). In an earlier report, a hydrothermally synthesized TiO2–MWCNT based DSSC delivered a PCE of 7.37%, compared to a PCE of only 4.9% obtained for its TiO2 based analogue, thus illustrating that MWCNTs facilitate fast electron transport to the external circuit and improve efficiencies.6 Among QDs, a narrow gap QD such as PbS or PbSe with a band gap in the near infrared (NIR) region6–10 is preferred over visible light absorbing QDs such as CdSe or CdS,11–17 as broader spectral utilization is possible with the NIR absorbing QDs, thus resulting in increased charge separation and collection. For a ZnO/PbS QD/graphene based solar cell, a PCE of ∼6.36% was achieved compared to ∼5.28% for an equivalent cell without graphene. Authors propounded that conductive graphene helps in extracting charges.18 An ozone treated PbS QD based organic solar cell gave an efficiency of 1.68%, which was higher than that delivered by air-annealed devices.19 Low optical absorption and high series resistance of the air-annealed device were responsible for its poor response. In another recent study, a ZnO/PbS QD based cell produced a PCE of 6%.10 In the above-described reports, the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) span from the visible to the NIR region (>800 nm), extending even up to 1400 nm, thus implying that PbS QDs are very effective in harvesting longer wavelengths.
Besides customizing the wide gap semiconductor and the photosensitizer, the TiO2/QDs/electrolyte interface can also be engineered to suppress back electron transfer to the oxidized species in the electrolyte and to the intra-gap states introduced by the defects in QDs, the key reasons for the lower PCEs of QDSCs compared to DSSCs and even organic solar cells. In the recent past, the application of passivating layers of ZnS or SiO2 or amorphous TiO2 and their blends over TiO2/CdSeTe QD based photoanodes, proved to be extremely successful in reducing electron recombination.15,20–22 These layers passivate the surface trap states on QDs, and also of the TiO2 surfaces uncovered by QDs, thereby decreasing charge recombination, and enhancing efficiencies. PCEs in the range of 8.2–10% have been achieved by using such interfacial barrier layers.15,20–22 In another study, fumed silica nanoparticles (SiO2 NPs) were incorporated into a polysulfide electrolyte to regulate the TiO2/QD/electrolyte interface of CdSexTe1−x QDSCs and the authors observed that both the fill factor (FF) and open circuit voltage (VOC) increased in the presence of this electrolyte additive.23 The authors deduced that SiO2 not only gels the liquid polysulfide electrolyte, but also inhibits interfacial recombination to improve the cell performance, as the PCE increased from 8.73% (at 0 wt% SiO2) to 11.73% (at 3 wt% of SiO2).23
Another factor that controls QDSC performance is the counter electrode (CE). Low cost, high electrocatalytic activity towards sulfide reduction, high electrical conductivity, and a chemically robust structure are the desirable characteristics in a counter electrode. Tin sulfide (SnS) is an attractive option for a CE, as it satisfies these pre-conditions, and although it has been employed in a DSSC previously,24 it has not been used in a QDSC to date. The efficiency of a SnS nanosheet based DSSC was 6.56%, as opposed to 7.57% obtained for the same cell with a Pt CE. The short circuit current densities of the two cells were found to be comparable (JSC ∼ 17.7 and 17.5 mA cm−2), which highlighted the good catalytic activity of the SnS based CE.24
In the present report, with the objective of developing high performance QDSCs, the cell architecture is designed by incorporating the following elements. (a) A TiO2–MWCNT based composite (instead of TiO2) is used for anchoring PbS QDs, to enhance the charge collection capability of the photoanode. (b) PbS QDs with a band gap of 1.1 eV are used for wider spectral conversion to electricity. (c) A gel electrolyte dispersed with electrochemically inert TiO2 NPs is used as the hole transport material, to curb interfacial recombination. (d) A CE, new in QDSCs, namely, SnS nanoparticles (NPs) tethered to a carbon (C)-fabric is employed. The resulting QDSC configuration of TiO2–MWCNTs/PbS/ZnS-S2−/PVA/TiO2-SnS/C-fabric shows excellent solar cell performance, and how each of the aforementioned strategies influence cell performance is studied in detail. The novel cell configuration coupled with the features incorporated into the cell are expected to be of great use in developing cells with robust, stable performances.
Experimental section
Materials
Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates with a sheet resistance of ∼25 Ω cm−2 were purchased from Pilkington and were cleaned in a soap solution, 30% HCl solution, twice distilled water and acetone, in that order, before use. Titanium isopropoxide, ethyl cellulose (EC), terpineol, 1-octadecene (ODE), 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT), trioctylphosphine (TOP), thioacetamide, bis[bis(trimethylsilyl)amino]tin(II), [Sn-[N(SiMe3)2]2], poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and sodium sulfide (Na2S) were purchased from Aldrich. MWCNTs (CAS number 308068-56-6), with a surface resistivity of 700–900 Ω, and dimensions of outer diameter × inner diameter × length = 10 nm × 4.5 nm × 4 μm, were purchased from Aldrich. Oleic acid, acetonitrile, hexane, acetone, 3-mercaptopropionic acid, sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid were purchased from Merck. Bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide (TMS) was purchased from TCI. Ultra-pure water with a resistivity of ∼18.2 MΩ cm was obtained through a Millipore Direct-Q 3 UV system. TiO2-P25 nanoparticles were a free gift from Evonik.
Preparation of the photoanode

Preparation of TiO2–MWCNTs. 
TiO2–MWCNT nanocomposites were synthesized using a hydrothermal method previously reported by Muduli et al.6 2 mL of titanium isopropoxide was hydrolyzed with 5 mL of deionized water and 0.5 wt% of acid functionalized MWCNTs25,26 were added to this solution, which was followed by sonication for 10 min. The solution was then transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave along with 5% H2SO4 solution. The autoclave vessel was maintained at 175 °C temperature for 24 h. The obtained product was filtered and washed with deionized water 3–4 times and then dried in a hot air oven at 60 °C for over a day. Pristine TiO2 was also prepared by using the same procedure without the addition of MWCNTs.


Preparation of PbS QDs. 
PbS QDs were synthesized by using a method proposed by Ushakova et al.27 PbO (1 mmol) was dissolved in oleic acid (4 mmol) and 10 mL of 1-octadecene in a three necked 25 mL flask and degassed under a flow of argon for 30 min with constant stirring and the reaction mixture was heated to 170 °C for 1 h until it formed a clear solution which indicated the formation of a lead oleate precursor solution. Next, the sulfur precursor containing 0.2 mmol of TMS in 0.5 mL of 1-octadecene was injected into the above solution at 120 °C, and then the resulting solution was kept at this temperature for 15 min to yield a dark-brown colored solution of PbS QDs. The PbS QDs were purified and precipitated with ethanol and hexane 4–5 times. The PbS QDs were dispersed in chloroform for all preparations and characterizations.


Synthesis of SnS NPs. 
SnS NPs were prepared using a procedure reported by Hickey et al.28 0.78 mL (2 mmol) of bis[bis(trimethylsilyl)amino]tin(II), 5 mL (15.6 mmol) of 1-octadecene, 3 mL (6.7 mmol) of trioctylphosphine and 4.5 mL (14.2 mmol) of oleic acid were taken in a three necked round bottom flask and degassed under argon for 30 min with constant stirring and the reaction mixture was maintained at 170 °C for 30 min to form a clear solution. A solution containing 10 mL (30.4 mmol) of oleylamine, 3 mL (6.7 mmol) of TOP and 0.075 g (1 mmol) of thioacetamide was quickly injected into the above solution at 150 °C, and the solution was held at this temperature for 5 min. By the addition of this solution, the color changed from colorless to red and then to dark brown. The solution was cooled to room temperature and was purified and precipitated with ethanol and dispersed in chloroform for further use.


Preparation of a TiO2–MWCNT paste. 
A paste of TiO2–MWCNTs was prepared with a protocol used by Du et al.29 2.0 g of TiO2–MWCNTs was mixed with 15.2 mL of ethanol in a round bottom flask and this dispersion was sonicated for 10 min. Then, 8.1 g of terpineol and 10.4 g of ethanol solution with 10 wt% EC were dispersed in the same and sonicated for 10 min. Ethanol was evaporated through a rotary evaporator and a TiO2–MWCNT paste was obtained. A paste of TiO2 was also prepared using the same procedure.


Fabrication of the photoanode. 
For the active layer of TiO2–MWCNTs, the above prepared paste was deposited on a FTO substrate using a doctor blading method and the films were annealed at 80 °C for 30 min, followed by annealing at 500 °C for 30 min. One more layer of TiO2–MWCNTs was prepared using the same method by applying the TiO2–MWCNT paste and sequential annealing at 80 and 500 °C for 30 min, at each temperature. The FTO/TiO2–MWCNT substrates were dipped in an aqueous solution of 0.4 M TiCl4 at 70 °C for 20 min, and the coated substrates were rinsed in ultrapure water to remove the unabsorbed excess TiO2 and annealed at 500 °C (temperature increase, at the rate of 5 °C min−1).


Preparation of the TiO2–MWCNT/QD electrode. 
The TiO2–MWCNT coated FTO substrate was immersed in a solution of bifunctional linker molecules (10 wt% 3-mercaptopropionic acid or MPA) in acetonitrile for 12 h. A chemical bath deposition (CBD) method was used for the deposition of PbS QDs. Linker coated FTO/TiO2–MWCNT films were kept submerged in a PbS QD solution in chloroform with a concentration of 30 mg mL−1 for 4 h at room temperature. The films were rinsed in chloroform and stored in the dark at 45 °C.


Fabrication of CEs and QDSCs. 
SnS/C-fabric electrodes were prepared by drop casting of SnS NPs over the C-fabric. Cell fabrication was accomplished in a sandwich manner. Two layers of ZnS were deposited over the photoanode by SILAR, using 0.1 M Zn(OAc)2 and 0.1 M Na2S baths. 120 μm thick double-sided tape was used as a spacer between the photoanode and the CE (SnS/C-fabric or C-fabric). The double-sided tape was affixed along the periphery of the photoanode area. 10 wt% of poly(vinyl alcohol) was dissolved in deionized water and heated to a temperature of 90 °C for 2 h to form a gel, and then cooled to room temperature. 0.1 M Na2S and 0.1 M KCl were dissolved in the above gel, and 0.1 mmol of TiO2 P-25 NPs was dispersed in the above gel. The cavity was filled with the gel. For supporting the CE, the SnS/C-fabric or C-fabric electrode was glued to a glass slide, and it was placed over the photoanode/spacer assembly with the SnS side facing the photoanode. The whole assembly was held together with binder clips, and the cells were exposed to light from the rear side for all measurements. A cartoon illustrating the preparation of the photoanode and QDSC is shown in Scheme 1.

Characterization techniques
Optical absorption spectra were recorded on a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3600) for the dispersion of PbS QDs in chloroform in a quartz cuvette in absorbance mode and for the films of TiO2, TiO2–MWCNTs and TiO2–MWCNTs/PbS coated on micro-slide glass plates in diffuse reflectance mode, and converted to absorbance using a Kubelka–Munk function. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were recorded on a PANalytical, X'PertPRO instrument with Cu-Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation. The Raman spectra of TiO2 and TiO2–MWCNTs were recorded on a Bruker Senterra Dispersive Raman Microscope spectrometer; the laser excitation wavelength was fixed at 532 nm. Surface morphology analysis of the electrodes was performed using a scanning electron microscope (ZEISS EVO 18 Special Edition). Transmission electron microscopy studies were carried out using JEOL JEM-1011 and JEOL 3010 (with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV) microscopes. The samples were extracted into a volatile solvent, and then applied to grids, and measurements were performed after solvent evaporation.
A LOT-Oriel solar simulator equipped with a 150 W Xe lamp, and an AM 1.5 filter, capable of delivering a collimated output beam of 25 mm diameter, was coupled with a Metrohm Autolab PSTAT302N and was used for measuring the current versus potential (I–V) data of QDSCs, under 1 Sun (100 mW cm−2) illumination. The spatial uniformity of irradiance was confirmed by calibrating with a 2 cm × 2 cm Si reference cell and re-affirmed with an ILT1400 radiometer/photometer. External quantum efficiency (EQE) plots were recorded using a Quantum Efficiency Measurement System, Oriel IQE-200™ capable of measurements compliant to ASTM E1021-06. The light source was a 250 W quartz tungsten halogen lamp; the monochromator path length was 1/8M spot and the size was a 1 mm × 2.5 mm rectangule at focus. Cyclic voltammograms of pristine-TiO2, PbS and SnS films deposited over FTO substrates, and the SnS coated C-fabric were recorded in a three electrode cell, with the aforementioned as working electrodes, a Pt rod as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl/KCl as the reference electrode in an aqueous 0.1 M KCl electrolyte solution with a PSTAT302N with NOVA 1.11.2 software. Linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs) of the SnS/C-fabric and C-fabric were recorded by a two probe method by using two needle like stainless-steel probes set apart by 1 cm, at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) measurements of TiO2 and TiO2–MWCNTs deposited over FTO/glass substrates were carried out using a Veeco Nanoscope (with multimode scan) atomic force microscope. For C-AFM, cantilevers made of antimony doped silicon (n-doped; resistivity ∼0.01–0.025 Ω cm) and coated with Pt/Ir (20 nm) on the front and back are used. The spring constant of the tip is 0.2 N m−1. The current sensitivity is 1 nA V−1 and a load force of 47.6 nN is maintained between the tip and the sample. The sample deposited on FTO coated glass (area ∼ 9 mm2) is attached to a stainless-steel support with conducting carbon tape. A pin-hole free silver paste coating is applied to the surface of the active film, along the edge of the conducting glass substrate to the stainless-steel support, and the topography and current images are recorded at room temperature. The contact tip is scanned in contact with the sample surface. The z-feedback loop uses the dc cantilever defending a signal to maintain a constant force between the tip and the sample to generate topography images. Concurrently, a dc bias of 50 mV is applied to the tip. The sample is held at ground potential. The built-in pre-amplified scanner head measured the current passing through the tip and the sample and imaged the current profiles.
Results and discussion
Light absorption and conversion studies
The absorption spectra of different photosensitizers: TiO2, TiO2–MWCNTs, PbS and TiO2–MWCNTs/PbS are shown in Fig. 1a. The pristine TiO2 film shows a broad absorption below 400 nm and from the absorption edge by using the relation: Eg (eV) = 1240/λ (nm), the band gap of TiO2 was deduced to be 3.11 eV. The absorption band of the TiO2–MWCNT composite is broader and the absorption edge is slightly red-shifted, compared to TiO2. The band gap is 3.07 eV. PbS QDs show a broad absorption band in the 400 to 640 nm wavelength span in the visible region, and an additional broad peak with a λmax at 1130 nm is observed in the near infrared (NIR) region. The band gap is calculated to be 1.1 eV. The TiO2–MWCNT/PbS photoanode absorbs in the visible and in the NIR region, as the spectrum of this assembly shows a broad band in the visible region and a peak at 1130 nm. The cumulative effects of TiO2–MWCNTs and PbS are observed in the absorbance features of this photoanode.

J–V characteristics of QDSCs with the following photoanodes//counter electrode architectures: TiO2/PbS/ZnS//C-fabric, TiO2/PbS/ZnS//SnS/C-fabric, TiO2–MWCNTs/PbS/ZnS//C-fabric and TiO2–MWCNTs/PbS/ZnS//SnS/C-fabric: (b) under 1 Sun, and (c) in the dark. A water based gel containing 10 wt% PVA, 0.1 M KCl, 0.1 mmol of TiO2 NPs and 0.1 M Na2S was used as the electrolyte. 
QDSCs are constructed with the following photoanodes: TiO2/PbS/ZnS and TiO2–MWCNT/PbS/ZnS electrodes. The C-fabric and SnS coated C-fabric are used as CEs and a gel containing poly(vinyl alcohol), KCl, TiO2 NPs and 0.1 M Na2S serves as the hole transport material. Herein, KCl acts as a supporting electrolyte, PVA acts as a gelatinizing agent and TiO2 is used as a filler and as a passivating additive. When the TiO2 NPs come into contact with the photoanode assembly, they can serve as a supplementary blocking layer, in addition to the ZnS layers coated over the QDs, and like ZnS, prevent electron trapping in the intra-gap states in the QDs, and restrict recombination with the oxidized Sn2− species in the electrolyte. J–V characteristics were recorded for the cells, under an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5 spectrum) and the respective plots are shown in Fig. 1b and the parameters are summarized in Table 1, and the average values are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). For the cell based on TiO2/PbS/ZnS with C-fabric as a CE, the PCE of the champion cell is 3.75% with an open circuit voltage, VOC = 831 mV, JSC = 11.56 mA cm−2 and having the highest fill factor (FF = 39%), among all the cells used in this report. The cell with the same photoanode, TiO2/PbS/ZnS and with the SnS coated C-fabric as the CE, achieves an efficiency of 4.45%, with a VOC of 880.13 mV, JSC of 13.82 mA cm−2 and FF of 36.6%. The PCE increases by 18% with the SnS/C-fabric based cell relative to the C-fabric based cell. The superior electrocatalytic activity and greater electrical conductivity of the SnS/C-fabric over the C-fabric allows fast electron transfer from the external circuit to the redox couple, thus resulting in better charge separation and higher VOC. For the cell with TiO2–MWCNTs/PbS/ZnS as a photoanode and the C-fabric as a CE, the PCE of the champion cell is 5.41%, with a VOC of 834 mV, JSC of 18.3 mA cm−2 and a FF of 35.4%. The PCE of this cell is increased by 44% when compared to the equivalent cell with a TiO2/PbS film as a photoanode.

Herein, a procedure used by Du et al.29 was used for preparing the TiO2 paste. The authors achieved a very high PCE of 5.43% for the device with FTO/TiCl4/TiO2/CdSe as the photoanode and brass foil as the counter electrode with optimized TiO2 photoanode films. The role of MWCNTs as efficient electron conduits, which extract the photoexcited charges from the conduction bands (CBs) of TiO2 and the PbS QDs, and deliver them to FTO, is evidenced by comparing the two cell (with and without MWCNTs) responses. The energy band diagram in Fig. 2 shows that the Fermi level of MWCNTs is favorably positioned at 4.5 eV, below the CBs of TiO2 and PbS QDs at 4.2 and 4.08 eV respectively, and above the work function of FTO (∼4.7 eV). Photoexcited electrons in PbS QDs can depopulate by cascading to the CB of TiO2 (then to the Fermi level (EF) of the MWCNTs and then to FTO) or can directly relay to the EF of the MWCNTs. The positions of the CBs and valence bands (VBs) are determined by combining the data obtained from cyclic voltammetric studies (Fig. S1, ESI†) and the optical band gaps. The role of the CE in controlling the cell performance is judged by comparing the two cells with TiO2–MWCNTs/PbS/ZnS as the photoanode, but with the SnS/C-fabric and the C-fabric as CEs. The cell with a SnS/C-fabric CE delivers the highest PCE among all the cells studied here, and the champion cell's PCE is 6.3%, with the highest VOC of 900 mV, JSC of 20 mA cm−2 and a FF of 35%. This cell's counterpart with a C-fabric CE gives a PCE of 5.41%. Furthermore, the Fermi level or the valence band maximum of the SnS NPs is positioned at ∼5.1 eV (Fig. 2). Electrons from the external circuit are injected into the EF of SnS via the conductive C-fabric, and they readily reduce Sn2− species, which leads to enhanced performance. Representative dark current profiles of the cells are shown in Fig. 1c. For the TiO2–MWCNTs/PbS-gel-SnS/C-fabric configuration, the dark current density varies from 0.04 to 0.003 mA cm−2. For the remaining cells it is lower. Previously, dark current densities in the range of −2 to +2 mA cm−2 have been observed over a potential range of −0.4 to +0.6 V for PbS based QDSCs.30 MWCNTs furnish a path for recombination, and as a result, the dark current is higher for the cells with MWCNTs in the photoanode. However, the photocurrent produced upon illumination is markedly higher for the cells with MWCNTs compared to the cells without MWCNTs, as can be judged from Table 1 in the MS, which provided motivation for using these electrodes as photoanodes.

Recently, Jiao et al.,31 reported the PCE for a device with TiO2/PbS/CdS0.33 as a photoanode, Cu2S/FTO as a counter electrode and polysulfide as an electrolyte; they achieved an efficiency of 7.19% with a fill factor of 64.2%. It is also well known that the fill factor (FF) is largely controlled by the shunt resistance (RSh) of the device. A high shunt resistance implies a high FF and a low series resistance (RS) imparts a high efficiency to the cell. The shunt and series resistances of the cells are tabulated in Table 1. The shunt resistances are almost comparable to those for SnS/C-fabric and C-fabric, when combined with the same photoanode. As a consequence, the FF does not vary significantly on going from C-fabric to SnS/C-fabric, when TiO2–MWCNTs/PbS is used as the photoanode, and it is higher for the cells with C-fabric when TiO2/PbS is the photoanode, due to a larger magnitude of RSh. However, at the same time, with MWCNTs, the increase in JSC is significant, which tends to outweigh the FF disadvantage.
The ability of MWCNTs to promote charge extraction was gauged from fluorescence quenching studies. Fluorescence spectra of PbS QD, TiO2/PbS and TiO2–MWCNT/PbS films obtained at an excitation wavelength of 379 nm are shown in Fig. 3a. PbS QDs show a broad emission in the visible region, with three λmax values at 408, 434, and 459 nm. This emission in all likelihood, stems from the deactivation of electrons which are excited from the levels below the valence band maximum to the levels above the conduction band maximum, i.e., corresponding to energies in excess of the band gap. The visible light excitation is depicted in Fig. 2. The intensity of this emission is quenched in the presence of TiO2 (in TiO2/PbS), and further quenched in the presence of TiO2–MWCNTs (in TiO2–MWCNTs/PbS). The increased florescence quenching observed with MWCNTs, again indicates that MWCNTs facilitate photo-excited charge extraction from PbS.
 Fig. 3  (a) Fluorescence spectra of photoactive films. (b) EQE spectra of QDSCs encompassing the following photoanodes: TiO2/PbS/ZnS and TiO2–MWCNTs/PbS/ZnS and with SnS/C-fabric as a CE. A water based gel containing 10 wt% PVA, 0.1 M KCl, 0.1 mmol of TiO2 NPs and 0.1 M Na2S was used as the electrolyte. 
Plots showing the variation in EQE as a function of wavelength for cells with the two photoanodes, TiO2/PbS/ZnS and TiO2–MWCNTs/PbS/ZnS, and having the same CE, SnS/C-fabric, are presented (Fig. 3b). The EQE is a ratio of the number of photogenerated electrons to the number of impinging incident photons of a given wavelength. For the TiO2/PbS/ZnS cell, the maximum EQE is about 40% in the wavelength range of 390 to 500 nm, and EQE has significant values in the UV region (340 to 390 nm) and in the red region (500 to 610 nm) and it varies between 2 and 12% in the wavelength range of 610–650 nm, which coincides with the light absorption regime of PbS. For the TiO2–MWCNT/PbS/ZnS cell, the maximum EQE is about 53% in the wavelength range of 370 to 520 nm, and EQE has reasonably good values in the wavelength range of 330 to 370 nm and 520 to 620 nm. Thereafter, it lies between 3 and 15% in the wavelength range of 620–650 nm. MWCNTs are effective in channeling the excited electrons to the external circuit, and this is reflected in the enhanced EQE obtained for the MWCNT based cell over the entire wavelength range under consideration. However, it must be noted that the increase in the PCE (obtained from J–V curves) on going from the TiO2/PbS/ZnS cell to the TiO2–MWCNTs/PbS/ZnS cell is 41.5% which is much higher than the increase in the EQE (%), which is 30.3%. The difference in the PCE and EQE increments is due to the limitation posed by the Oriel IQE-200™ instrument, which cannot measure the response above 1100 nm.
Nanoscale current flow comparison
To understand the role of MWCNTs in promoting charge extraction and transport to FTO in the cells with the TiO2–MWCNT composite in the photoanode, the nanoscale current maps of TiO2 and TiO2–MWCNTs are compared. Fig. 4 shows the simultaneous topography and current images recorded for the films of TiO2 and TiO2–MWCNTs on FTO substrates; the scanned area is 700 nm × 700 nm for each film.
 Fig. 4  Concurrent topography and C-AFM current images of (a and a′) pristine TiO2 and (b and b′) TiO2–MWCNTs. The corresponding section profiles taken along a central line in the images are shown as insets. 
The topography of TiO2 (Fig. 4a) shows the presence of aggregated TiO2 NPs and the dimensions of these agglomerates vary from 20 to 190 nm. The corresponding current image (Fig. 4a′) shows a uniform distribution of bright domains over the entire region under consideration. The bright portions are assigned as regions of high current, and the dark regions arise from the low current domains. The average current flowing across the film is ∼20 pA, and the maximum current is 90 pA. The reasonable magnitude of the current attained in pristine TiO2 is attributed to charge propagation facilitated by the surface defects such as dangling bonds and oxygen vacancies. The current is color-scaled at the right sides of the current maps. For the TiO2/MWCNT electrode, the topography image (Fig. 4b) shows uniformly distributed elongated particles, indicating the presence of MWCNTs. In the corresponding current image (Fig. 4b′), the bright regions are more closely spaced compared to the current image of TiO2. The average current flowing across the composite film is ∼2 nA, which is almost four orders of magnitude greater than the current carrying capability of pristine TiO2, and the maximum current is two orders of magnitude higher than that of sole TiO2, thus confirming that the charge transport across the photoanode can be improved by the incorporation of MWCNTs into the assembly. These bright regions can be treated as the localized conducting domains, and their ability to conduct electrons is superior to that of similar domains in pristine TiO2, owing to the presence of MWCNTs. The almost seamless distribution of the bright regions indicates that unhindered charge movement is realized in the TiO2–MWCNT composite film.
Morphologies and structures
The morphologies of the photoanode films and the CE are shown in Fig. 5. The SEM images of pristine TiO2 (Fig. 5a and b) reveal an interconnected network of TiO2 nanoparticles with no distinct grain boundaries. The films are highly porous with a wide variation in pore dimensions, ranging from 20 to 100 nm. A high loading of QDs across the cross-section of the oxide is possible due to the porous structure. The images of the TiO2–MWCNT composite (Fig. 5c and d) show particulate morphology, indicating a homogeneous mixing of MWCNTs and TiO2 NPs. This textured morphology is also very conducive to good absorption of PbS QDs. The images of the TiO2–MWCNT/PbS film (Fig. 5e and f) show intertwined wavy structures which are uniformly distributed over multiple micron length scales. The SEM images of the C-fabric (Fig. 5g) show that the fabric is composed of solid cylindrical carbon fibers with smooth contours, approximately 5 μm thick, and these interweave and endow the fabric with a mat like appearance, as can be gauged from the photograph in Scheme 1. Upon drop-casting of SnS NPs onto the C-fabric, a SnS/C-fabric CE is obtained, and the corresponding SEM image (Fig. 5h) shows that the QDs coat the carbon fibers of the fabric homogeneously and no uncovered portions are visible, implying an intimate contact between the fibers and the QDs, that is most advantageous for fast electron injection from the C-fabric into the Fermi level of SnS NPs during QDSC operation.

The X-ray diffractograms of pristine–TiO2, TiO2–MWCNTs, PbS and SnS are shown in Fig. 6(a–d). The XRD pattern of pristine TiO2 shows peaks at d = 3.51, 2.42, 2.37, 1.88, 1.69, 1.66, 1.48, and 1.26 Å which correspond to the (101), (103), (004), (200), (105), (211), (204) and (215) planes of the tetragonal body centered cubic lattice, in agreement with the powder diffraction file (PDF) # 89-4921. For PbS, the pattern is characterized by distinct peaks at 2θ = 26.09°, 30.10°, 43.07°, 51.00°, 53.41° and 71.01°, corresponding to inter-planar spacings (d) of 3.42, 2.96, 2.09, 1.79, 1.71 and 1.33 Å, and these values match with the (111), (200), (220), (311), (222) and (420) planes of a face centered cubic lattice of PbS (PDF # 77-0244), thus ratifying the formation of PbS QDs. The diffractogram of SnS NPs shows peaks at 2θ = 26.60°, 31.34°, 31.68°, 38.74°, 50.55° and 52.83° and these correspond to inter-planar distances of 3.35, 2.85, 2.82, 2.31, 1.80 and 1.73 Å, and are assigned to the (021), (100), (130), (131), (151) and (061) planes of the orthorhombic symmetry of the end centered lattice of SnS (PDF # 32-1361).

The Raman spectra of the acid functionalized MWCNTs, TiO2 and TiO2–MWCNTs are shown in Fig. 6(a′–c′). MWCNTs show two sets of D and G bands. The fundamental or first order vibrational modes due to the defects (or stretching mode of disordered graphitic carbons) and the in-plane stretching mode of sp2 hybridized (graphitic) C–C bonds lead to the D and G bands at 1343 and 1577 cm−1, with an ID/IG ratio of 1.49. The first overtones, namely, 2D and 2G bands appear at 2677 and 2927 cm−1. The Raman (shift) peaks of TiO2 are observed at 396, 512 and 640 cm−1, characteristic of Ti–O bond vibrations.6 In the TiO2–MWCNT composite, the D and G bands and the 2D and 2G bands (that stem from MWCNTs) show blue-shifts (to higher energies) relative to pristine MWCNTs, whereas the Ti–O modes are slightly red-shifted, compared to TiO2. These positional shifts, and the line broadening observed in the composite are attributed to the van der Waals attractive forces between TiO2 and the MWCNTs and the electrostatic interactions between the COO− groups on MWCNTs and the Ti4+ species. In the composite, the ID/IG ratio is 0.94. The decrease in this ratio indicates that TiO2 passivates the surface defects on MWCNTs to some extent.
TEM images of the photo-/electro-active materials are displayed in Fig. 7. The TEM image of the mono-disperse PbS QDs and the corresponding lattice scale image of the PbS QDs are shown in Fig. 7a and b. The images show discrete PbS quantum dots, with sizes in the range of 3 to 8 nm. QDs with inter-fringe separations of 0.34 and 0.17 nm are observed, and these match well with inter-planar spacings of 3.42 and 1.71 Å, corresponding to the (111) and (222) planes of PbS with a fcc lattice. The TEM image of TiO2 (Fig. 7c) shows agglomerated particles of TiO2, and in some regions, distinct grains of TiO2 are observed. The NP dimensions vary from 10 to 40 nm, which is typical of mesoporous TiO2. The TEM images of TiO2–MWCNTs are displayed in Fig. 7d and e. The images show aggregated nanoparticles of TiO2 which appear to be superimposed over the MWCNTs as fuzzy contours of MWCNTs that are visible in the images, thus indicating the formation of a homogeneous composite wherein the TiO2 nanoparticles are uniformly tethered to the CNTs. The TEM images of TiO2–MWCNTs/PbS (Fig. 7f and g) show PbS QDs and TiO2 NPs anchored to the elongated structures of MWCNTs. Grains with dimensions below 10 nm are in all likelihood PbS, and the larger sized grains are TiO2. TEM images of the SnS NPs are presented in Fig. 7h and i. The particles have elliptical shapes, and their dimensions are in the range of 5–20 nm.

Effect of TiO2 NPs
The effect of TiO2 NPs on the gel electrolyte is studied. A comparison of J–V characteristics of cells with the same photoanode: a TiO2–MWCNT/PbS/ZnS film and the same SnS/C-fabric CE, but with three different electrolytes, namely, a solution of 0.1 M Na2S without TiO2 or PVA and gels with and without TiO2 NPs are presented in Fig. 8a. The PCE of the QDSC based on the gel containing TiO2 NPs is 6.3%, and for the same cell with a gel without TiO2 NPs, it is 6%. The cell based on the liquid electrolyte exhibits a PCE of 6.16%, with a VOC of 812 mV, JSC of 18 mA cm−2 and FF of 42%. TiO2 NPs modify the surface of the TiO2–MWCNT/PbS film, induce a passivating effect, which prevents trapping of electrons in the defect states of the PbS QDs, thus resulting in an improved performance of the cell.

The inset of (c) is the equivalent circuit used for fitting the data. 
The effect of extended exposure to light on the PCE of the cells was studied. The stability (Fig. S2 and Table S2, ESI†) of the best performing cell was evaluated by exposing the cell to sunlight (1–2 Sun irradiance) for 5 h. The photoanode was TiO2–MWCNTs/PbS/ZnS and the electrolyte was a gel with 0.1 M Na2S, 0.1 M KCl, 0.1 mmol TiO2 NPs and 10 wt% of PVA in water and the SnS/C-fabric served as the CE. The PCE reduced from 6 to 5.51%. The PCE decreased by 8.16%. A similar exposure test for an analogous cell, however, with a gel but without TiO2 NPs, showed a PCE decrease from 5.73 to 4.56%. The PCE decreased by 20.4%. The PCE decreases upon extended exposure to sunlight due to the removal of QDs from the photoanode and photo-decomposition. The PCE drop is more severe for the cell devoid of TiO2 NPs, indicating that the NPs tend to protect the QDs from photocorrosion.
Besides this, the I–V characteristics of the three different electrolytes were measured in a two electrode system comprising two stainless steel electrodes of 3 cm2 area each, and separated by a distance of 3 cm, at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in the voltage range of −1 to +1 V (Fig. 8b). The conductances (G) of the three electrolytes: gel without TiO2 NPs (0.1 M Na2S + 0.1 M KCl + 10 wt% of PVA in water), gel with TiO2 NPs (0.1 M Na2S + 0.1 M KCl + 0.1 mmol TiO2 NPs + 10 wt% of PVA in water) and 0.1 M Na2S in water were calculated to be 0.054, 0.08 and 0.03 S respectively, by using the equation G = 1/R = I/V (slopes of the linear fits). TiO2 NPs serve as a filler and assist in improving the mobility of the ions. EIS spectra of the three electrolytes are shown in Fig. 8c, and they were obtained under an ac amplitude of 20 mV. All the three electrolytes show large skewed arcs, and the data are fitted into an equivalent circuit shown therein as an inset. EIS parameters are provided in Table S3 (ESI†). The bulk resistances are comparable to the three electrolytes, and the 1/Rb values match reasonably well with the conductances deduced from the LSV plots. Among the three electrolytes, the charge transfer resistance for sulfide reduction is the least, and the double layer capacitance (Cdl) and charge-diffusion conductance (Yo) are highest for the gel electrolyte with NPs. TiO2 NPs facilitate ion movement in the electrolyte, vis-à-vis their ability to act as a filler.
Charge transfer and transport studies
Electrochemical impedance spectra of QDSCs with TiO2/PbS/ZnS and TiO2–MWCNTs/PbS/ZnS as photoanodes, and with the SnS/C-fabric as CEs were recorded under 30 mW cm−2 white light illumination, at an ac amplitude of 20 mV. The Nyquist and Bode plots recorded under short circuit (Vdc = 0 V) and open circuit (Vdc = 0.75 V) conditions, and over a frequency range of 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz are shown in Fig. 9a and b, and the parameters are tabulated in Table 2. The bulk resistance (Rb) and electron transport resistance (Re) for the TiO2–MWCNT/PbS/ZnS electrode are smaller than those of the TiO2/PbS/ZnS electrode under short circuit conditions. Re is a measure of the resistance offered by the TiO2/PbS or TiO2–MWCNT/PbS interface for electron transfer. Fast electron transfer from the CB of TiO2 or from the CB of PbS, to FTO in the TiO2–MWCNT composite based cell is enabled by the MWCNTs, due to their high electrical conductivity and suitably positioned Fermi level, and therefore Re is much lower (45 Ω cm2) compared to that for the TiO2 based cell (Re ∼ 96 Ω cm2). The electron recombination resistance (Rrec) at the TiO2/QDs and electrolyte interface is obtained with an open circuit and it is 52 Ω cm2 for the cell without MWCNTs and 59 Ω cm2 for the one with the MWCNTs in the photoanode, indicating that recombination is also to some extent increased by MWCNTs. Chemical capacitance (Cμ) is a measure of the electron density in the CB of TiO2, and exhibits an exponential increase, when TiO2 has a good conductivity.32Cμ is also found to be higher for the TiO2–MWCNT/PbS/ZnS cells, compared to the TiO2/PbS/ZnS cells, indicating a higher electron population in the CB of TiO2 in the presence of MWCNTs, which can also be correlated with the higher JSC obtained for the composite based cell. In the low frequency straight-line region, the parameter, Yo represents the ease of diffusion of electrons, under zero dc bias. Yo is nearly three times greater for the MWCNT electrode based cell compared to the one devoid of MWCNTs.

From the Bode phase plot (Fig. 9b), both the electron transit time and electron recombination time for the photoanode can be determined under short-circuit and open circuit conditions. The electron transit time, τd, is the time taken by the photoexcited electron to reach the current collector through the CB of TiO2. τd can be calculated from the expression τd = 1/2πf, where f is the frequency of the maximum imaginary component. τd for the TiO2–MWCNTs/PbS/ZnS is 0.04 ns, which is faster than that of the TiO2/PbS/ZnS which is 0.06 ns. The electron recombination time, τn, is the time taken by the photoexcited electron to recombine with the oxidized species of the electrolyte. τn for the TiO2–MWCNTs/PbS/ZnS cell is 0.27 ns, and for the TiO2/PbS/ZnS cell, it is 0.39 ns. For a good solar cell performance, τd should be shorter than τn.
To evaluate the charge transfer capability of the SnS/C-fabric CE in comparison to the C-fabric as a CE, symmetric cells were constructed with the sulfide based gel electrolyte (containing KCl, Na2S, PVA and TiO2 NPs) and impedance spectra were recorded (Fig. 9c and d) and the fitting parameters are provided in Table 3. In this method, the same material serves as a working electrode and counter electrode. Rb or the bulk resistance offered by the electrolyte is comparable for both cells (∼8–10 Ω cm2). Rct represents the catalytic activity of the electroactive electrode at the electrode/electrolyte interface, and is obtained from the radius of the first semicircle. Rct for the symmetric SnS/C-fabric cell is 3.6 Ω cm2 and for the analogous C-fabric cell, it is 6.3 Ω cm2. The SnS/C-fabric cell shows less resistance to charge transfer than the C-fabric cell. The poor charge transfer rate at the CE typically results in a high overpotential for Sn2− reduction, which blocks the electron flow, and promotes back electron transfer at the photoanode.33 The lower JSC obtained for cells with C-fabric, compared to the SnS/C-fabric cells reflects the effect of this Rct differential. Cdl represents the double layer capacitance at the electrode/electrolyte interface due to the accumulation of the ions at the electrode surface. The higher the Cdl for an electrode, the better the electrocatalytic activity is. The SnS/C-fabric cell shows a high Cdl of 12.4 μF cm2 compared with that to 3.5 μF cm2 (obtained for the C-fabric cell). Herein, the Bode plot gives the time for charge diffusion across the cross-section of the electrode. The diffusional time is 0.35 s for the SnS/C-fabric electrode, as opposed to 0.45 s, indicating a faster electron propagation compared to the C-fabric cell.

The electrocatalytic activities of the two electrodes: SnS/C-fabric and C-fabric are compared from their LSV plots (Fig. 9e) measured in the gel electrolyte, with Pt as a counter electrode and Ag/AgCl/KCl as the reference electrode, over a potential range of −0.9 to +0.3 V. In the reduction sweep of the voltammograms, broad peaks are observed at −0.57 and −0.46 V for the C-fabric and SnS/C-fabric. The peaks are due to the following reduction reaction: Sn2− + 2e− → Sn−12− + S2−(1)The redox potential for this reduction is −0.5 V (versus normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)),34 which is −0.697 V versus Ag/Ag+. Here, even with C-fabric, the overpotential (η) for polysulfide species reduction is negative (−0.127 V), indicating that the reduction occurs at lower negative potentials than the theoretically expected values. It is even more negative with SnS/C-fabric (η = −0.24 V), indicating that SnS NPs catalyse the reduction of polysulfide more efficiently than C-fabric does. Further evidence for the effectiveness of SnS/C-fabric as a CE was obtained by comparing its I–V profile with that of C-fabric. The I–V characteristics of the two electrodes measured over a voltage range of −0.2 to +0.2 V are shown in Fig. 9f. The plots show an Ohmic behavior over a narrow voltage range of approximately −0.05 to +0.05 V. The slopes of the straight line fits, in the Ohmic regimes, correspond to the conductances of the CE materials, as per the relation (I/V = 1/R = G (Ω−1)). The conductances of SnS/C-fabric and C-fabric are 0.06 and 0.15 Ω−1 respectively. Since the conductance of C-fabric is only nominally reduced upon coating with SnS NPs, it is obvious that SnS NPs can easily transmit electrons to oxidized polysulfide species during QDSC operation.
Photovoltage decay
Photovoltage decay is also an important tool to measure charge transfer characteristics and the recombination process of solar cells.30,35 The cells were illuminated by a white LED source having a 30 mW cm−2 light intensity for 10 s, then a voltage is produced across the cell, and when the light is switched off, charges recombine either with the defect states, or with the electrolyte and the photovoltage decay was monitored as a function of time. Rapid photovoltage decay implies fast recombination, and slower decay infers a greater charge build-up under illumination.36 The greater the density of electrons accumulated in the QDs or in the CB of TiO2 upon irradiance, the larger the in-built potential (under illumination off conditions), which effectively translates to a higher VOC in a QDSC. The photovoltage decay plots of cells with the two photoanodes, TiO2/PbS/ZnS and TiO2–MWCNTs/PbS/ZnS, and with the two CEs, C-fabric and SnS/C-fabric, are displayed in Fig. 10a. MWCNTs in the photoanode and SnS as the CE enhance photovoltage decay. The decay rate and as a consequence the recombination rate is lower for the TiO2–MWCNTs containing the photoanode when compared with the only TiO2 containing cell with the same counter electrode. This is because, recombination is controlled by the density of electrons available for the recombination. The density of electrons available for recombination is less in the case of TiO2–MWCNTs/PbS than TiO2/PbS, due to fast electron transfer to FTO. The charge recombination from the CB of TiO2 or CB of PbS with the intra-gap states in PbS QDs (introduced by the surface defects in QDs) and with the oxidized electrolyte species is diminished with the addition of MWCNTs to TiO2. It is also observed that the CE also plays a significant role in retarding the decay or recombination process. The cells with the SnS/C-fabric CE show slower decay compared to the cells with C-fabric as a CE. The higher VOC values obtained with the use of SnS/C-fabric as a CE, also indicate that hole extraction from the QD by the electrolyte is faster than back electron transfer to the redox couple.

(b) The Mott–Schottky plots of the water based gel containing 10 wt% PVA, 0.1 M KCl, 0.1 mmol of TiO2 NPs and 0.1 M Na2S recorded with two Pt electrodes and an Ag/AgCl/KCl reference electrode. 
To affirm the hole conducting capability of the gel electrolyte, the Mott–Schottky plots of the gel containing 0.1 M Na2S, 0.1 M KCl, 0.1 mmol TiO2 and 10 wt% of PVA in water were recorded with Pt as working and counter electrodes and Ag/AgCl/KCl as the reference electrode. The Mott–Schottky plots (1/C2versus E) for the gel at two different frequencies of 100 Hz and 1 kHz are shown in Fig. 10b. Negative slopes observed for the plots indicate a p-type semiconducting behavior despite the presence of an n-type semiconducting oxide (TiO2) in the gel, thus ratifying that the gel works as a hole transport material, which favors the hole scavenging from the VB of PbS to the sulfide redox couple during cell operation.
Conclusions
Three approaches were implemented to improve the performance of a TiO2/PbS based QDSC. Conventional TiO2 was replaced by a hydrothermally synthesized TiO2–MWCNT composite, a novel counter electrode, SnS NPs tethered to C-fabric was used, and TiO2 nanoparticles were incorporated as a filler and as a passivating agent into a gel electrolyte. MWCNTs increase the PCE of the QDSC, as they allow rapid charge collection from the CBs of TiO2 and the PbS QDs, due to their high electrical conductivity and suitably positioned Fermi level. This was supported by the lower electron transport resistance, and higher recombination resistance obtained for the corresponding cells, and also by their ability to conduct higher nanoscale currents compared to pristine TiO2. SnS/C-fabric outperforms the plain C-fabric as a CE, as cells with the former show higher efficiencies, and proof of its high catalytic activity for Sn2− reduction was obtained in the form of lower charge transfer resistance, and lower reduction potential compared to the C-fabric. The SnS/C-fabric also contributes towards attaining higher VOC and JSC. This study shows that by careful adjustment of the components of a QDSC, cells with reproducibly good performances can be developed.
