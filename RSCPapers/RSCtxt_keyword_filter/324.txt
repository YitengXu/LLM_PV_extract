    , Accepted 30th March 2021First published on 30th March 2021AbstractRecently, Ruddlesden–Popper two-dimensional (2D) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been intensively studied, owing to their high power-conversion-efficiency (PCE) and excellent long-term stability. In this work, we improved the performance of 2D PSCs by adding a non-fullerene acceptor (indacenodithiophene, IDIC) to the perovskite layer. We found that IDIC efficiently passivates the charge traps in the perovskite film and enhances the electron transport properties of PSCs. After adding 1.5 mg mL−1 IDIC to the perovskite layer, the average PCE of the 2D PSCs significantly improved, from 10.19% to 12.78%, corresponding to the 25% enhancement. The PCE improvement was mainly caused by the simultaneous enhancement of the short-circuit current density and fill factor. Moreover, the long-term stability of the studied 2D PSCs also improved, with the PCE degradation after 10 days significantly reduced, from 14.9% to 9.5%, which can be attributed to the enhanced moisture resistance of the perovskite layer. The best 2D PSC with added IDIC exhibited a PCE of 13.23%, with a stable power output and negligible hysteresis. Our results demonstrate that the addition of IDIC to 2D perovskite is a simple and effective method for fabricating high-performance 2D PSCs.
1. Introduction
Recently, organic–inorganic hybrid metal halide perovskite-based solar cells have been widely investigated and rapidly developed, owing to their advantages such as high power-conversion-efficiency (PCE), low cost, light weight, and convenient fabrication.1–4 Recently, a certified PCE of 25.5% has been reported for single perovskite solar cells (PSCs),5 making them very promising for future commercialization.
However, despite the high performance of PSCs, the problem of low environmental stability of their devices has to be solved, which strongly precludes the commercialization of PSCs.6,7 In humid environments, conventional 3-dimensional (3D) perovskites (for instance, MAPbX3, MA = CH3NH3, X = Cl, Br, or I) can be easily converted into hydrated perovskite phases, and eventually decompose to PbI2.8,9 To overcome this challenge, novel and more stable perovskite materials are needed. Consequently, all-inorganic perovskite materials (for instance, CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3) have been used for fabricating PSCs, in which MA was replaced by cesium.8,10,11 However, the band gap of all-inorganic perovskites is in the 1.8–2.3 eV range, which is much wider than that (1.5 eV) of MAPbI3.2,8,10,11 The poor light absorption property of these perovskites further limits the photovoltaic performance of relevant PSCs.8,10,11 Recently, low-dimensional perovskite materials with high light absorption coefficient have been intensively studied.12–22 For example, Ruddlesden–Popper 2D perovskites, particularly (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n is an integer and BA is CH3(CH2)3NH3) series, have been widely used in PSCs, owing to their tunable band gaps and high intrinsic stability.14–22 Although the PCE (<15%) of (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1-based 2D PSCs is still lower than that of conventional 3D PSCs, their long-term stability is significantly better.1–4,14–22 Therefore, further improving the performance of 2D PSCs is highly desired for satisfying their commercialization requirements.
In conventional 3D PSCs, MAI is typically easily released from perovskite at high temperatures, leaving vacancies in the perovskite crystal.23–25 Thus, passivating these defects in perovskites using molecules could significantly improve the PCE and stability of 3D PSCs, which has been a method of choice in recent years.23–25 For example, Shao et al. introduced phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as a defect passivator into inverted 3D PSCs, dramatically improving the PCE and reducing the hysteresis effect in PSCs.26 Li et al. used an ultrathin PCBM layer to passivate trap states of MAPbI3−xClx perovskite, which leads to an improved PCE from 17.23% to 20.07%.27 Zheng et al. reported the use of choline chloride and choline iodide for passivating the ionic defects of perovskites, thus significantly improving the PCE, from 17.1% to 20.0%, for MAPbI3-based PSCs.28 On the other hand, owing to their easily tunable energy levels, broadened absorption, and facile synthesis process, fused-ring non-fullerene-based electron acceptors have been demonstrated as good electron transport layers (ETLs) and defect passivators for fabricating PSCs.29–38 For example, Jiang et al. used combined TiO2 and 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC) as double ETLs, enhancing the PCE of PSCs up to 20.08%.34 Qin et al. added 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(5-hexylthienyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC-Th) into perovskite films as a defect passivator and perovskite stabilizer, improving the PCE (from 18.07% to 19.20%) and long-term stability of PSCs.35 Compared with ITIC and ITIC-Th, indacenodithiophene (IDIC) is another fused-ring-based non-fullerene acceptor with even higher electron mobility (μelectron, ∼1.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1).36–38 As a result, IDIC has proven to be an excellent ETL and defect passivator, in both standard and inverted 3D PSCs.36,37 Considering the relatively low PCE of 2D PSCs, it is very important to investigate the effect of defect passivation on the performance of 2D PSCs.
In this work, we report the use of a non-fullerene acceptor IDIC as a defect passivator, for improving the performance of (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13-based 2D PSCs. Following the addition of IDIC to perovskite films, the trap density significantly reduced from 7.3 × 1015 to 2.3 × 1015 cm−3, owing to the Lewis base nature of IDIC, which allows it to form coordinate bonds with under-coordinated Pb in perovskite. The electron mobility of the 2D perovskite layer also increased, from 5.3 × 10−4 to 7.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, with the addition of IDIC. Consequently, the average PCE of the studied 2D PSCs significantly improved, from 10.19% to 12.78%, which was mainly owing to the simultaneous enhancement of the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and the fill factor (FF). Moreover, the long-term stability of the studied 2D PSCs also improved, with the PCE degradation significantly reduced, from 14.9% to 9.5%, after 10 days of storage; this was attributed to the enhanced moisture resistance of the perovskite films. The best 2D PSC based on IDIC exhibited a high PCE of 13.23% with a stable power output and negligible hysteresis. Our results suggest that IDIC-induced defect passivation is an effective technique for improving the performance of 2D PSCs.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Device fabrication
IDIC, PCBM, and methylammonium iodide (MAI) were purchased from 1-Materials Inc. (Canada), Nano-C Inc. (USA), Advanced Election Technology Co., Ltd (China). Butylammonium iodide (BAI), lead iodide (PbI2), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), 2-propanol, and chlorobenzene (CB) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). Poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine) (PTAA) and bathocuproine (BCP) were purchased from EM Index (Korea) and Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. (China), respectively. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the 2D PSCs were fabricated on patterned indium-tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass with a glass/ITO/PTAA/perovskite structure (without or with IDIC)/PCBM/BCP/Ag. First, the PTAA solution (in CB, 10 mg mL−1) was spin-coated onto the ITO glass at 3500 rpm for 45 s. The samples were then thermally annealed at 80 °C, to completely remove the residual solvent. A 2D perovskite precursor was prepared by dissolving BAI, MAI, and PbI2 (molar ratio = 2:3:4) with 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 or 2.0 mg mL−1 IDIC in DMF, at a total concentration of 35 wt%. As shown in Fig. S1,† the color of the perovskite precursor changed from light yellow to green after adding IDIC. The perovskite precursor was spin-coated onto the PTAA layers at 4000 rpm for 45 s, in N2 atmosphere. Then, 2D (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 perovskite films were formed after thermal annealing at 100 °C. Subsequently, the PCBM solution (20 mg mL−1 in CB) was spin-coated onto the perovskite films at 1000 rpm for 60 s. Then, the BCP solution (in 2-propanol at 0.5 mg mL−1) was spin-coated onto the perovskite layers at 4500 rpm for 45 s. The fabrication of the 2D PSCs was completed by thermally evaporating 100 nm Ag onto the samples. The electron-only space-charge-limited current density (SCLC) devices were fabricated using a structure of glass/Ag/perovskite (without or with IDIC)/PCBM/Ag, with all the layers prepared following the same condition. The effective working area of the 2D PSCs was 0.1 cm2, which was defined by a shadow mask.

2.2 Characterization
The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectrum was characterized using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 750 (USA). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using an X-ray diffractometer (Panalytical, Netherlands). Cross-sectional images of the PSCs and top-view images of the perovskite surfaces were acquired using an SU8020 scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi, Japan) operated at the acceleration voltage of 8 kV. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured using a spectrometer (FLS920, Edinburgh Instruments, UK). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra of the electron-only devices were recorded in a dark environment using an electrochemical workstation (CHI622D, CH Instruments, USA). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra were recorded using a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, USA). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were measured for the irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (AM1.5). The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a solar cell IPCE measurement system (Solar Cell Scan 100, Zolix, China).
3. Results and discussion
The SEM cross-section image in Fig. 1(b) reveals the well-condensed layer-by-layer structure of the fabricated 2D PSCs. The SEM image indicates that the thicknesses of the perovskite and PCBM layers were approximately 350 nm and 55 nm, respectively. Fig. 1(c) shows the energy alignment in the fabricated PSCs, which indicates that electrons can be transported through IDIC to PCBM and collected by the Ag cathode, while holes are transported to PTAA and collected by the ITO anode. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of IDIC is −3.9 eV,38 which is slightly lower than that of perovskite (−3.8 eV).15 A suitable energy alignment ensures efficient electron extraction from the perovskite absorber to PCBM, using IDIC. Fig. 1(d) shows the molecular structure of IDIC, which is a π-conjugated non-fullerene acceptor with a Lewis base (CO and CN) at the ends of the IDIC molecule.36,37
We characterized the quality of the prepared 2D perovskite films using SEM, UV-vis absorption, and XRD measurements. The SEM image in Fig. 2(a) shows a uniform surface morphology with excellent coverage, in which 2D planes with a lateral dimension of 1–3 μm can be observed. The UV-vis absorption spectrum in Fig. 2(b) shows a broad absorption range (400–800 nm) for the 2D (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 perovskite film, with a specific absorption peak observed at 608 nm, consistent with previous studies.16,17 In the XRD pattern in Fig. S2,† the two dominant peaks at 14.2° and 28.5° represent the crystallographic (111) and (202) planes of the 2D (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 perovskite film, respectively. The strong and sharp peaks indicate the good crystallization of the 2D perovskite film.17 The SEM, UV-vis absorption, and XRD results indicate the good preparation of the 2D (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 perovskite film, which is a basic requirement for fabricating high-performance PSCs.

The J–V performance results of the studied 2D PSCs are presented in Fig. 3(a), and the device parameters are summarized in Table 1. The reference 2D PSCs without IDIC showed an average PCE of 10.19%, with a low Jsc of 16.8 mA cm−2 and FF of 52.2%, respectively. The performance of the reference 2D PSCs was similar to those reported previously using (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 perovskite as the absorber, indicating the good optimization of our experiment.14–22,33,39 As shown in Table 1, the PCE of the 2D PSCs gradually improved with increasing the IDIC amount (from 0.5 to 1.5 mg mL−1). Following the addition of 1.5 mg mL−1 IDIC to perovskite, the 2D PSCs exhibited a maximal averaged PCE of 12.78%, with significantly enhanced Jsc (18.4 mA cm−2) and FF (66.8%). Fig. S3† shows the PCE values of the control and 1.5 mg mL−1 IDIC-added PSCs (each group contains 32 individual devices), indicating a clear PCE improvement when using IDIC. The best sample in the 1.5 mg mL−1 IDIC-based group showed the highest PCE of 13.23%, which is an excellent value for (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13-based PSCs.14–22,33,39 Further increasing the concentration of IDIC (to 2.0 mg mL−1) degraded the performance of the 2D PSCs, with an average PCE of 11.78%. As shown in Fig. S4,† the aggregation of IDIC molecules (at high concentration) induced small cracks in the perovskite films, indicating poor morphology. The IPCE spectra of the reference and 1.5 mg mL−1 IDIC-added PSCs are shown in Fig. 3(b), revealing the photon-to-electron response for a broad range of wavelengths (350–800 nm). The Jsc values calculated from the IPCE spectra were 16.5 and 17.9 mA cm−2 for the reference and 1.5 mg mL−1 IDIC-added PSCs, respectively. These values differ only by approximately 3% from the measured Jsc values (from the J–V characteristics), demonstrating the high accuracy of our measurements. As shown in Fig. 3(c), the J–V characteristics of the best sample from the IDIC-added group, under forward and reverse scans, exhibited a negligible hysteresis (see Table S1†); for the reverse scan, the PCE of the PSC was 13.37%, slightly higher than that (13.23%) for the forward scan, which was attributed to the slightly increased FF (from 67.6% to 68.4%). Comparing Fig. 3(c), S5, Tables S1 and S2,† shows that by using IDIC, the hysteresis effect of the PSCs was reduced, which will be discussed later. The steady-state current density and PCE as a function of time for the best 2D PSCs are shown in Fig. 3(d). The current density stabilized at 16.8 mA cm−2 for 300 s, yielding a stabilized PCE of 13.05%, which indicates a stable output of the 2D PSC.

To identify the PCE improvement of PSCs using IDIC, we compared the J–V performance of the electron-only SCLC devices using the structure of glass/Ag/perovskite (without or with IDIC)/PCBM/Ag,33,40 in which hole transport could be blocked. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the J–V characteristic curves of the SCLC devices can be divided into three regions. In the low-voltage range, the current density increases linearly with the voltage, indicating an ohmic response.40–43 In the intermediate-voltage range, the current exhibits a rapid increase, indicating the trap-filled limit, where all the available trap states are filled by the injected carriers.40 The voltage between the ohmic contact and trap-filled regimes is known as the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL), which is determined by the trap states. Hence, the trap density (ntrap) can be calculated using eqn (1):40–43 (1)where L is the thickness of the perovskite film, ε is the relative dielectric constant of perovskite, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, and e is the elementary charge. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the VTFL values of the devices without and with IDIC are 0.66 and 0.21 V, corresponding to ntrap of 7.3 × 1015 and 2.3 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. The ntrap of control devices is similar with those in previous studies using (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 as the absorber.21,33 However, ntrap of IDIC added devices is 68.5% lower than that of control devices, which is a low value for the (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 perovskite.21,33 This reduced ntrap can be explained by the molecular structure of IDIC, which contains a Lewis base (CO and CN) at the ends, as shown in Fig. 1(d). Previous studies demonstrated that IDIC can effectively passivate the traps at the surface of 3D perovskite by forming coordinate bonds with under-coordinated Pb in perovskite.36,37 This can be evidenced by measuring the FT-IR spectra of IDIC and perovskite with IDIC powers. As shown in Fig. S6,† the FT-IR spectra indicate a weakened vibration strength of (CO and CN) at 1700 and 2216 cm−1, which demonstrates the interaction between the Lewis base groups of IDIC and 2D perovskite.37 In fact, vacancies can also be formed in 2D perovskite, because MAI and BAI were used for 2D perovskite preparation, which can also be lost from perovskite at high temperatures (during thermal annealing at 100 °C). In 2D PSCs, these vacancy defects could also function as electron traps, which further degrade the performance of PSCs. By using IDIC, the vacancy-induced electron trap density of (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 perovskite can be reduced, owing to the defect passivation. A slightly enhanced XRD signal (Fig. S2†) can be another evidence for the coordinate bonding between Pb and IDIC, improving the perovskite crystal. The reduction in the defect-induced electron trap density is also the main reason for reducing the hysteresis of PSCs.26 In the high-voltage range, the current increased quadratically with the voltage in the Child's regime. In addition, the electron mobility can be determined according to the Mott–Gurney law using the following equation:40 (2)where the calculated μelectron of the devices without and with IDIC were 5.3 × 10−4 and 7.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The improved μelectron can be explained by the defect passivation of IDIC, which significantly reduces the electron trap density. Moreover, the intrinsic μelectron of IDIC is similar to that of PCBM (approximately 1.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1),38 which is beneficial for conducting electrons from the perovskite layer to the electrodes. To prove this hypothesis, we characterized the charge transfer properties of the PSCs with and without IDIC (1.5 mg mL−1) using EIS measurements. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the spectra can be fitted using an equivalent circuit (shown in the inset), which consists of a series resistance (Rs), a charge transfer resistance (Rct), and a capacitor (C).41,44 In PSCs, usually Rs is related the interfacial connections between different functional layers, while Rct indicates the charge transfer process through different layers (from perovskite film to electrodes).45 After using IDIC, Rct of the PSCs decreased from 476 to 311 Ω, demonstrating the improvement of the electron transport property of the PSCs when using IDIC as the defect passivator. The charge recombination properties of the PSCs can be analyzed by measuring the dependence of Jsc and Voc on the incident light intensity (from 0.1 to 1 sun). As shown in Fig. 4(a), the calculated slopes for the dependence of Jsc on the light intensity, for the PSCs without and with IDIC were 0.92 and 0.99, respectively, indicating suppressed bimolecular recombination in the PSCs.46,47 As discussed above, the use of IDIC in perovskite could facilitate electron transport from perovskite to PCBM (Fig. 1(c)), weakening the recombination at the interface of perovskite/PCBM. The dependence of Voc on the light intensity in Fig. 4(d) shows that the PSCs without IDIC exhibited a high slope of 1.67 kT/q, where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and q is the elementary charge. On the other hand, the PSCs with IDIC exhibited a shallower slope of 1.38 kT/q, indicating the reduced trap-assisted recombination in the PSCs.46,47 This can also be explained by the trap passivation effect of IDIC, which reduced ntrap and facilitated the charge transport in the PSCs. The analysis of SCLC, EIS, and light intensity dependence results explained well the improved Jsc and FF of the studied PSCs. Moreover, the Voc of the PSCs can be described by the Shockley equation:48–50 (3)where J0 is the reverse saturation current density, and n is the ideality factor. As a result, the suppressed charge recombination (resulting in decreased J0) and enhanced Jsc can explain the slight improvement in Voc (from 1.03 V to 1.05 V).

The exciton quenching effect of IDIC can be characterized by measuring the PL and time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra of perovskite and perovskite with IDIC films (on glass). As shown in Fig. 5(a), bare 2D (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 perovskite films exhibited a PL intensity peak at the wavelength of 774 nm, whereas the perovskite films with IDIC exhibited a significantly quenched PL signal (approximately 75% quenched). This indicates the exciton quenching effect of IDIC, which could extract electrons from the LUMO of perovskite films.17,33,37 The PL peak for the perovskite films with IDIC was blue-shifted by 5 nm, compared with that of the bare perovskite films, which might be owing to the coordinate bonding to the energy levels of perovskite films.26,37 Fig. S7† showed the PL maps of bare perovskite and IDIC added perovskite films, which also revealed a weakened PL intensity upon using IDIC. The TRPL spectra of the perovskite films without and with IDIC are shown in Fig. 5(b), revealing a significantly reduced PL lifetime associated with using IDIC. By fitting bi-exponential curves to the spectra, we found that the PL lifetime dramatically decreased, from 312 ns to 98 ns, confirming the efficient charge transport from perovskite to IDIC.33,37 The analysis of PL and TRPL spectra demonstrates the enhanced charge transport of PSCs upon using IDIC from another aspect.

In addition, we investigated the long-term stability of the fabricated 2D PSCs with and without IDIC in the perovskite film; the stability was assessed for 10 days. We stored the unencapsulated devices in air under dark conditions, at a relative humidity of 30–40% and room temperature (25 °C). As shown in Fig. 6(a) and S8,† after 10 days of storage, the PCE for the PSCs without IDIC was only 8.67%, corresponding to a high PCE degradation of 14.9% (original PCE was 10.19%). In contrast, the PCE for the PSCs with IDIC was still 11.57%, suggesting a weaker PCE degradation of 9.5% (original PCE was 12.78%). The PCE degradation of the PSCs with IDIC was 36% lower than that of the bare PSCs, indicating enhanced long-term stability conferred by IDIC. From Fig. 6(b), the contact angle of bare perovskite was only 12°, indicating strong hydrophilicity, which might be attributed to the MA and BA groups in 2D perovskite films.16 The contact angle of perovskite films with added IDIC was 29°, which could be explained by the hydrophobic nature of IDIC (contact angle of 85° for pristine IDIC films). It is known that moisture-induced decomposition of perovskites is one of the most important factors underlying the performance degradation of PSCs.51–53 Therefore, adding hydrophobic IDIC into perovskite films can efficiently protect the perovskite films from moisture in air, in turn improving the stability of the PSCs.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we improved the performance of inverted 2D PSCs by adding a non-fullerene acceptor IDIC into their perovskite layers. The coordinate bonding of IDIC with under-coordinated Pb in perovskite can efficiently passivate vacancy defects, which is beneficial for charge transport in PSCs. The average PCE of the studied 2D PSCs significantly improved, from 10.19% to 12.78%, which was mainly attributed to the simultaneous improvement of Jsc and FF. The SCLC, PL, and EIS analyses demonstrate efficient trap passivation and enhanced charge transfer by using IDIC. The light intensity dependence results indicate suppressed charge recombination in the PSCs upon using IDIC. The long-term stability of the studied 2D PSCs also improved, with the PCE degradation significantly reduced from 14.9% to 9.5% after 10 days, which could be attributed to the enhanced moisture resistance of perovskite films. The best 2D PSC based on IDIC exhibited a high PCE of 13.23% with a stable power output and negligible hysteresis. Our results indicate that using IDIC as a defect passivator in 2D perovskite films is an effective way to improve the performance of 2D PSCs.
