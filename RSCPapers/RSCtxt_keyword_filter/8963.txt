    , Accepted 13th February 2012First published on 16th February 2012AbstractThree near infrared (NIR) metal-free organic sensitizers (FNE32, FNE34, FNE36) based on the thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine derivative have been designed and synthesized for application in quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). These organic dyes demonstrate maximum absorption bands at 596–625 nm due to the presence of the thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine derivative, which facilitates the intramolecular electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor. Quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on FNE34 display efficient photoelectric conversion over the whole visible range extending into the NIR region up to 900 nm with maximum incident monochromatic photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) of 77%, yielding a short-circuit photocurrent density of 16.24 mA cm−2 and a power conversion efficiency of 5.30%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest efficiency for quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on an organic NIR dye. When exposed to one-sun illumination for 1000 h, the quasi-solid-state DSSC based on FNE34 exhibits good long-term stability with almost constant power conversion efficiency.
1. Introduction
Since the discovery by O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991,1 dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted extensive attention in the last two decades due to the efficient conversion of solar energy to electricity at a low cost.2 In a typical DSSC, absorption of sunlight by the dye molecules creates a high energy state that can inject the photoexcited electrons into the conduction band of the semiconductor electrode, predominately nanocrystalline TiO2. After percolation through the mesoscopic TiO2 thin film, the electrons are collected by the conducting substrate and then the oxidized dye molecules are regenerated by the reducing species in the electrolyte solution, predominately I− ions. Undoubtedly, photocurrent is significantly determined by the light harvesting efficiency of the dye molecules. Therefore, chemists have focused on the design of novel dye molecules that can absorb sunlight as much as possible. As metal-free organic dyes2a usually have larger absorption coefficients (attributed to an intramolecular π–π* transition) than metal complex photosensitizers3 (attributed to metal-to-ligand charge transfer), they have attracted more attention for use in (quasi-)solid-state DSSCs.4 To harvest sunlight in a broad spectral range, it is essential to extend the absorption range of the organic sensitizer. Several organic NIR dyes have been designed and reported, such as organic sensitizers containing porphyrin,5 tetrahydroquinoline,6 phenoxazine,7 squaraines,8 perylene,9 boradiazaindacene10 phthalocyanine,11 and diketopyrrolopyrrole12 units. However, the structures of most reported NIR dyes are extremely complicated and they cannot be easily modified for enhancing the solar cell performance. Moreover, the stability of the DSSCs based on the reported NIR dyes is not satisfactory, probably due to the decomposition of the instable dye structure. Consequently, novel stable organic dyes with wide absorption covering the whole visible region are still pursued.
In comparison to the DSSCs with liquid electrolytes, quasi-solid-state DSSCs4 have shown greatly improved long-term stability as there is less or no possibility of leakage of the electrolyte. Therefore, in view of promising commercial application, the study on quasi-solid-state DSSCs has been an active area of DSSC research. Herein, we reported three NIR sensitizers, coded as FNE32, FNE34, and FNE36, based on thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine (Fig. 1)13 for the construction of efficient quasi-solid-state DSSCs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that used thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine to construct dye sensitizers for use in DSSCs. As compared with the organic dyes reported previously,14 the incorporation of the thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine derivative into the D–π–A structured dye plays a key role in red-shifting the maximum absorption band over 600 nm and extending the photoelectric response into the NIR region up to 900 nm. Energy levels of the sensitizers can be tuned by expanding the conjugation of the thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine derivative. By replacing the thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine unit in FNE32 with a more delocalized acenaphtho[1,2-b]thieno[3,4-e]pyrazine unit in FNE34 and FNE36, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is negatively shifted, resulting in better matching with the conduction band of TiO2. In this work, we discussed the effect of the thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine derivative and its position on photophysical and electrochemical properties and their relation with photovoltaic performance. Among the three dyes, the highest power conversion efficiency of 5.30% was achieved for the FNE34 based quasi-solid-state device, which also exhibited good long-term stability when exposed to one-sun illumination for 1000 h.

2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials and reagents
Acenaphthenequinone was obtained from Acros. Thiophene, glyoxal solution in water (40%, w/w), N-bromosuccinimide were purchased from J&K Chemical Ltd, China. Organic solvents used in this work were purified using the standard process. Other chemicals and reagents were used as received from commercial sources without further purification. Transparent conductive glass (F-doped SnO2, FTO, 15 Ω square−1, transmittance of 80%, Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Japan) was used as the substrate for the fabrication of a TiO2 thin film electrode.
2.2 Synthesis of sensitizers
The synthesis details and the characterization of the sensitizers are described in the ESI.†
2.3 DSSC fabrication and photovoltaic measurements
TiO2 films (12 μm) composed of a 6 μm nanoparticle (20 nm) layer in direct contact with the FTO substrate and a 6 μm light scattering particle (80% 20 nm TiO2 + 20% 100 nm TiO2) layer were fabricated with a screen printing method and used in this study.15 The films were sintered at 500 °C for 2 h to achieve good necking of neighboring TiO2 particles. The sintered films were then treated with 0.05 M TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min followed by calcination at 450 °C for 30 min. When TiO2 electrodes were cooled down at around 120 °C, the electrodes were dipped in dye solutions (0.3 mM in toluene) for 24 h at room temperature for complete dye adsorption. The dye-loaded TiO2 film as a working electrode and the Pt-coated FTO as a counter electrode were separated by a hot-melt Surlyn film (30 μm) and sealed together by pressing them under heat. A quasi-solid-state gel electrolyte was prepared by mixing 5 wt% poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) with a redox solution containing 0.1 M LiI, 0.1 M I2, 0.1 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) and 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPImI) in 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN) under heating until all solids were dissolved. After introducing the hot gel solution into the internal space of the cell from the two holes predrilled on the back of the counter electrode, a uniform motionless polymer gel layer was formed between the working and the counter electrodes, and then the holes were sealed with a Surlyn film covered with a thin glass slide under heat.
2.4 Characterizations
UV-vis absorption spectra of dye solutions and dye-loaded films were recorded with a Shimadzu Model 3100 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer in a transmission mode. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed with an Autolab analyzer using a typical three-electrode electrochemical cell in a solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) in water-free acetonitrile with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 at room temperature under argon. Dye adsorbed TiO2 on conductive glass was used as the working electrode, a Pt wire as the counter electrode, and an Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode. The potential of the reference electrode was calibrated by ferrocene, and all potentials mentioned in this work are against normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). The film thickness was measured by a surface profiler (Veeco Dektak 150, USA). The working performance of the DSSC was tested by recording the current density–voltage (J–V) curves with a Keithley 2400 source meter (Oriel) under illumination of simulated AM1.5G solar light coming from a solar simulator (Oriel-94043A equipped with a 450 W Xe lamp and an AM1.5G filter). The light intensity was calibrated using a standard Si solar cell (Newport 91150). A black mask with aperture area of 0.2304 cm2 was used during measurement to avoid stray light.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Molecular design and synthesis
The target dye structure (Fig. 1) is designed to extend the photoresponse into the NIR region by introducing a thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine chromophore into the π-conjugation bridge. The synthetic approach to sensitizers FNE32 and FNE34 is depicted in Scheme 1. The synthesis of FNE32 started from 5,7-dibromothieno[3,4-b]pyrazine.16 A Stille coupling17 with tributyl(3-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene)stannane offered the spacer bridging the donor and anchor groups. The ethylhexyl substituents were chosen to ensure sufficient solubility in common organic solvents. Moreover, the introduced alkyl chains can effectively inhibit the intermolecular aggregation and charge recombination for the purpose of reducing current and voltage losses.18 After refluxing with a Vilsmeier reagent,19 the corresponding monoaldehyde-substituted derivative was produced in a yield of 60%. Triphenylamine, acting as an electron donor, was attached via Stille coupling and offered the precursor. In the last step, the obtained precursor was converted to dye FNE32 by Knoevenagel condensation20 with cyanoacetic acid through refluxing acetonitrile in the presence of piperidine. Similarly, compound FNE34 was synthesized through the same procedure from 8,10-dibromoacenaphtho[1,2-b]thieno[3,4-e]pyrazine.21

In order to investigate the effect of the position of the inserted acceptor group on the DSSC performance, an isomer, FNE36, was designed and synthesized for control experiment. In comparison to FNE34, the acenaphtho[1,2-b]thieno[3,4-e]pyrazine acceptor is exchanged with one neighboring thiophene unit in FNE36. Therefore, the synthesis of compound FNE36 was similar to that of FNE34 and started from the same starting material as that for FNE34, i.e., 8,10-dibromoacenaphtho[1,2-b]thieno[3,4-e]pyrazine (Scheme 2). Two asymmetrical Stille coupling with N,N-diphenyl-4-(tributylstannyl)aniline and 3′,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-5′-(tributylstannyl)-(2,2′-bithiophene)-5-carbaldehyde, respectively, afforded the monoaldehyde-substituted precursor. Finally, the obtained precursor was converted to sensitizer FNE36via Knoevenagel condensation with cyanoacetic acid by reflux in acetonitrile in the presence of piperidine. All the target dye sensitizers were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectroscopy, and were found to be consistent with the proposed structures. The obtained dyes are black in the solid state and can dissolve in dichloromethane (DCM), tetrahydrofuran (THF) or toluene to produce a deep green or deep blue solution.

3.2 UV-vis absorption properties
The electronic absorption spectra of the three sensitizers in toluene solutions are shown in Fig. 2a and the corresponding properties are listed in Table 1. The absorption spectrum of FNE32 displays the maximum absorption wavelength at 596 nm, due to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the donor to the acceptor. Under the same conditions, FNE34 exhibits an absorption maximum at 625 nm. A bathochromic shift of 29 nm at absorption maximum is observed when thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine is replaced with acenaphtho[1,2-b]thieno[3,4-e]pyrazine. This can be probably explained by the fact that the acenaphtho[1,2-b]thieno[3,4-e]pyrazine unit extends the π-conjugation in the spacer as compared with thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine, which results in the extended π-conjugation system.22 However, although the structure of FNE36 is similar to FNE34, the maximum absorption wavelength of FNE36 is peaked at 612 nm, which shows a hypsochromic shift of 13 nm as compared with that for FNE34. A possible explanation is that the modification of the position of the acenaphtho[1,2-b]thieno[3,4-e]pyrazine unit in FNE36 weakens the ICT transition from the donor to the acceptor. To summarize, not only the kind of the additional acceptor but also its position can affect the absorption properties. Extended conjugation of the additional acceptor from thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine to acenaphtho[1,2-b]thieno[3,4-e]pyrazine bathochromically shifted the absorption peak significantly. Finally, we achieved metal-free organic dyes with broad absorption similar to the famous black dye3b through this molecular design. Organic sensitizers with oligothiophene as bridge have achieved great success for efficient DSSCs.23 However, the terthiophene based dye (Fig. S1, ESI†) has maximum absorption at around 460 nm,14 and increasing the thiophene number has proved to be unsuccessful to bathochromically shift the maximum absorption of the sensitizers significantly (e.g. >600 nm). Herein, as compared to the reference dye based on terthiophene (Fig. S1, ESI†), a simple fusion of the pyrazine derivative into one thiophene ring successfully bathochromically shifts the maximum absorption band from 460 to 625 nm by 165 nm without increasing the number of thiophene (Fig. S2, ESI†).

Moreover, to study the intermolecular interactions of the three sensitizers, the absorption spectra of the sensitizers with different concentrations were recorded and displayed in Fig. S3 (ESI†). With the concentration decreasing from 10−4 M to 10−6 M, no obvious shift of the maximum wavelength can be observed for all the sensitizers, which indicates that the attached 2-ethylhexyl groups on the thiophene units effectively retard the intermolecular interactions and thus suppress the dye aggregation.

Fig. 2b shows the absorption spectra of the organic sensitizers anchored on transparent mesoporous TiO2 films. After adsorption of the organic dyes on the surface of the TiO2 films, hypsochromic shifts of 20, 15, and 22 nm were observed for sensitizers FNE32, FNE34, and FNE36, respectively, which could be owing to the deprotonation of the carboxylic acid.24 However, unlike most reported D–π–A systems, where the hypsochromic shift in absorption maximum from the solution to the dye loaded TiO2 film is much larger,18,25 the slight hypsochromic shift in this case is obviously due to the additional thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine acceptor. After anchoring sensitizers onto the nanocrystalline TiO2 surface, although the anchor group was deprotonated, the ICT from the electron donor unit to the inserted thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine unit was not weakened significantly and therefore only slight hypsochromic shift could be observed.26 Similar to the absorption spectra in solutions, when the acceptor changed from thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine (FNE32) to acenaphtho[1,2-b]thieno[3,4-e]pyrazine (FNE34 and FNE36), a bathochromic shift is observed on sensitized TiO2 films, which originates from the different effective conjugation length. Moreover, under the same conditions, the absorption intensities of FNE34 and FNE36 are lower than that of FNE32. It can be stemmed from the larger size of the acenaphtho[1,2-b]thieno[3,4-e]pyrazine group as compared with the thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine group, which reduces the dye adsorption amount on the TiO2 surface. This is further proved by desorbing organic dyes from the TiO2 surface. The surface concentration of FNE32 is 1.3 × 10−8 mol cm−2 μm−1, while that for FNE34 and FNE36 decreased to 1.0 × 10−8 and 1.1 × 10−8 mol cm−2 μm−1, respectively.
3.3 Electrochemical properties
To determine the oxidation potential of the organic dyes and thermodynamically evaluate the possibility of sensitizer regeneration, CV was carried out with TiO2 films stained with a sensitizer as the working electrode in a solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) in water-free acetonitrile with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 (Fig. 3). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of sensitizers FNE32, FNE34, and FNE36, taken from the first oxidation potential, are calculated to be 0.97 V, 0.88 V, and 0.90 V (vs. NHE, the same below), respectively, which are more positive than the redox potential of the I−/I3− redox couple (∼0.4 V), indicating that the reduction of the oxidized dyes with I− ions is thermodynamically feasible. Correspondingly, estimated from the band gap derived from the wavelength at 10% maximum absorption intensity for the dye-loaded TiO2 film,2e the LUMO energy levels of dyes FNE32, FNE34, and FNE36 are −0.64 V, −0.76 V, and −0.74 V, respectively. The HOMO and LUMO levels are affected significantly by the kind of the pyrazine derivative but slightly by its position. Moreover, the negative shift of LUMO levels for FNE34 and FNE36, compared with that for FNE32, is probably due to the large conjugated system of acenaphtho[1,2-b]thieno[3,4-e]pyrazine, which delocalized the LUMO and thus negatively shifted the LUMO level. The negatively shifted LUMO level indicates that the driving force for electron injection of FNE34 or FNE36 is larger than that for FNE32.

3.4 Theoretical approach
Density functional calculations were conducted using the Gaussian 03 program package at the B3LYP/6-31G level to get further insight into the geometrical and electronic properties of the resulted sensitizers. It is clearly seen from Fig. 4 that the HOMO is distributed along the D–π system and the LUMO is evenly delocalized across the entire π–A system. The large overlapping of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals on the thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine unit implies that the thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine unit could facilitate the electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor/anchor (i.e. cyanoacetic acid unit), which is mainly responsible for the large red shift of maximum absorption as compared to the typical terthiophene based dye (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†). Upon photo-excitation, the electrons in the organic dyes loaded on the nanocrystalline TiO2 surface could be successively transferred from the donor to the thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine unit, then transferred to the cyanoacetic acid unit, and finally into the conduction band of TiO2.

3.5 Solar cell performance
Quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on the resulted sensitizers were fabricated with a polymer gel electrolyte.4a To achieve the best DSSC performance, the content of both TBP and I2 was firstly optimized for the FNE34 based quasi-solid-state DSSC and the performance data are summarized in Table 2. In the absence of TBP in the electrolyte, Jsc is much lower than expected. As shown in Table 2, when the concentration of TBP was below 0.1 M (Ciodine = 0.1 M), both Voc and Jsc increased upon the addition of TBP in the electrolyte, which is in contrast to the reported phenomenon that the presence of TBP improves Voc but decreases Jsc as TBP can negatively shift the conduction band of TiO2. This is probably because TBP can affect the dye arrangement towards a favorable mode for efficient electron injection. However, when the TBP concentration was higher than 0.1 M, the Jsc value decreased significantly but Voc increased slightly with the TBP concentration. This is mainly attributed to the negative shift of the conduction band of TiO2 caused by the adsorption of TBP on the TiO2 surface, which lowered the driving force for the electron injection but enlarged the energy level difference between the Fermi level of TiO2 and the redox potential under light.

Similarly, the content of I2 in the electrolyte also significantly affected the DSSC performance (Table 2). When the concentration of I2 increased from 0 to 0.05 M and further to 0.1 M (CTBP = 0.1 M), the Jsc value increased due to the enhanced concentration of redox couple. However, upon further increasing I2 concentration, both Voc and Jsc values decreased as the increased I2 content in the electrolyte produced more chances for the electron recombination between the injected electrons and I3−.18 Combining the two factors, it was found that the highest power conversion efficiency for the FNE34 based quasi-solid-state DSSC could be obtained with 0.1 M TBP and 0.1 M I2 in the electrolyte.

Fig. 5 compares the J–V curves for the quasi-solid-state DSSCs under 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM 1.5 G solar light. The FNE32 based DSSC produced a Jsc of 11.29 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.47 V, and an FF of 0.69, corresponding to an η of 3.66%. Under the same conditions, the quasi-solid-state DSSC based on FNE34 offered a Jsc of 16.24 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.48 V, and an FF of 0.68, corresponding to an η value of 5.30%. The increased DSSC performance is attributed to the enhanced photo-induced current induced by the higher driving force for the electron injection from the excited organic dyes into the TiO2 film. However, although FNE36 has similar chemical structure, the η of the FNE36 based DSSC decreased to 4.93% (Jsc = 14.66 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.48 V, FF = 0.70) due to the reduced photo-induced current. It is remarkable that FNE34 produced very high Jsc in a quasi-solid-state DSSC. However, the Voc for the three NIR dyes is pretty low, similar to some other NIR dyes reported in the literature.6,7,8f,i,9b,10b,12 The reason why these NIR dyes produced such low Voc values is not clear so far, which deserves a detailed study in the future. We think that the low Voc may be attributed to the dye adsorption effect on the conduction edge. It is reported that coadsorption of additives, such as deoxycholic acid (DCA), in the DSSCs based on strongly aggregated organic dyes can inhibit the molecular aggregation and increase the Voc and η.27 However, upon coadsorption of DCA, no significant change of the Voc values for the quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on the resulted sensitizers could be found, while both Jsc and η dramatically decreased due to the reduced dye amount. It is not difficult to be understood that the incorporation of ethylhexyl groups into the thiophene units in the three sensitizers has already effectively suppressed the intermolecular aggregation, which is proved by the absorption spectra of the three sensitizers in different concentration solutions (Fig. S3, ESI†). Therefore, the coadsorption indeed reduced the dye coverage on the TiO2 surface and induced the decrease of the DSSC performance.

It is interesting to make a comparison between FNE34 and the similar dye WS-5 reported previously.20b Under the same conditions, the quasi-solid-state DSSC for WS-5 produced Jsc of 11.46 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.65 V, FF of 0.66, corresponding to η of 4.91%. By comparison, FNE34 produced much higher Jsc than WS-5 due to its much broader absorption and IPCE spectra. This indicates that our molecular design is effective to broaden the absorption of the dye and thus to enhance short-circuit photocurrent remarkably. As a consequence, FNE34 generated higher power conversion efficiency than WS-5 in the case of quasi-solid-state DSSCs.
Action spectra of the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiencies (IPCE) as a function of incident wavelength for the DSSCs based on the resulting organic dyes on TiO2 films are shown in Fig. 6. Notably, the quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on the three sensitizers exhibit remarkably broad IPCE spectra covering the whole visible region and partial NIR region with the threshold over 900 nm. It can be found that the highest IPCE value of ∼77% was achieved for the FNE34 based quasi-solid-state DSSC at a platform ranging from 440 to 640 nm, from which integrated photocurrent was calculated to be 16.19 mA cm−2, in good agreement with the measured Jsc. The maximum IPCE values for the quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on the three sensitizers are in the order of FNE32 < FNE36 < FNE34, consistent with the tendency of LUMO levels of corresponding organic dyes. A more negative LUMO level indicated a more sufficient driving force for electron injection, which resulted in a higher IPCE. An explanation for the higher IPCE value of the FNE34 based DSSC compared to the FNE36 based DSSC could be that the closer distance between the acenaphtho[1,2-b]thieno[3,4-e]pyrazine unit and the anchor group in sensitizer FNE34, as compared with FNE36, facilitated the excited electrons to transport from the donor moiety to the anchor moiety passing through the thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine unit. It is impressive that the IPCE onsets are located around 900 nm for the three dyes, which is comparable to that for the black dye.3b

The most important advantage of solid-state DSSCs is their stability during long-time operation. Therefore, the stability of the quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on the resulted sensitizers was recorded over a period of 1000 h under one-sun soaking. Fig. 7 displays the photovoltaic performance parameters of the FNE34 based quasi-solid-state DSSC under one sun soaking. Initially, Jsc and Voc values slightly changed within 5%, followed by a plateau, while FF and η values remained almost constant. The power conversion efficiency remained 100% of the initial value after 1000 h of one sun soaking, which indicates that the quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on the resulting NIR sensitizers demonstrated good long-term stability during light soaking.

4. Conclusions
In summary, three simple organic sensitizers which incorporated a strong electron-withdrawing unit, thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine, in the conjugated bridge were designed and synthesized. The maximum absorption bands of the three dyes are peaked between 596 and 625 nm. Moreover, the quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on these dyes demonstrate broad IPCE spectra over the whole visible range extending into the NIR region up to 900 nm. Compared with FNE32 consisting of the thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine unit, FNE34 and FNE36 consisting of a more conjugated unit, acenaphtho[1,2-b]thieno[3,4-e]pyrazine, have higher LUMO levels without hypsochromically shifting the absorption band. As a result, a more sufficient driving force for electron injection was achieved and accordingly the power conversion efficiency of quasi-solid-state DSSCs was improved from 3.66% for FNE32 to 5.30% and 4.93% for FNE34 and FNE36, respectively. The NIR dye FNE34 maintained almost constant power conversion efficiency under one-sun soaking for 1000 h, indicating that the thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine based NIR dye is a promising candidate for practical applications. The drawback of these NIR dyes is the low Voc, and therefore much higher efficiency can be expected if we can improve the Voc significantly (e.g. >0.7 V). Our future work will focus on further molecular engineering to fine tune the energy levels of the dye towards higher Voc.
