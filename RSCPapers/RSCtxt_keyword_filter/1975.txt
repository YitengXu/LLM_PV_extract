    , Accepted 12th May 2017First published on 16th May 2017AbstractMetallic nanoparticles (NPs) with tunable physical, optical and catalytic properties have a wide range of applications including various optoelectronics, sensors and fuel cells. In this paper, we demonstrate the evolution of various physical properties, configurations, size and density of palladium (Pd) nanostructures on sapphire(Al2O3) (0001) by the systematic control of deposition amount (DA) at distinct annealing temperatures. The transformation of the deposited thin films into various Pd NPs is achieved by the dewetting of the thin film by means of surface diffusion, nucleation, Volmer–Weber growth and surface energy minimization mechanism. Depending on the evolution of size, density and configuration, five distinctive regimes of Pd nanostructures are demonstrated: (i) nucleation and evolution of small NPs between 1 and 3 nm, (ii) medium NPs with the dominating vertical growth between 5 and 20 nm, (iii) laterally expanded large NPs between 30 and 40 nm, (iv) irregular coalesced Pd NPs between 50 and 80 nm and (v) voids evolution between 100 and 200 nm. Initial film thickness and annealing temperature play major roles on the dewetting process and the resulting Pd nanostructures are notably distinguished. The fabricated Pd nanostructures influence the lattice vibration modes of sapphire(0001) such as gradual decrement in the intensity and left-shift of the peak position with increased surface coverage. In addition, the optical properties are studied by UV-VIS-NIR (300–1100 nm) reflectance spectra, which shows the reflectance, absorption and scattering over the wavelength and are closely related to the morphology evolution of Pd nanostructures.
Introduction
Recently, metallic nanostructures have been extensively researched due to their feasibility for improving performances in various optoelectronic devices and potential applications such as those in solar cells,1,2 biomedical devices,3,4 sensors,5–7 fuel cells,8,9 and polymer membranes.10 The integration of a metallic nanostructure in these applications yields exceptional properties, which are strongly inherent in the size, configuration and density control of nanostructures.11 For example, the incorporation of small (∼6 nm) NPs in solar cells can yield an improved power conversion efficiency by increasing the surface area ratio (SAR) and mobility of carriers,2 and Pt NPs with dissimilar geometries of identical size can demonstrate the variance in the catalytic properties for oxidation reactions.12 Furthermore, the output power of P-GaN based LEDs can be improved due to the resonant coupling between the excitons in multiple quantum wells and localized surface plasmons.13 Among the various species of metallic NPs, palladium (Pd) has been more extensively adopted in catalytic applications14,15 and key elements in hydrogen sensors,16 fuel cells,17 and bio-sensing and biomedical devices18,19 due to its enhanced adsorption capacity, large surface to volume ratio and high hydrogen affinity.20–22 On the other hand, sapphire offers wide band-gap, high melting point, chemical inertness and mechanical durability; it has been employed in LEDs, laser diodes, IR-UV detectors, substrates for photocatalysts and numerous optical devices.23 Although several Pd nanostructure based applications have been demonstrated, the systematical fabrication of Pd nanostructure on sapphire(0001) has not been reported in the literature till date, which can be an essential reference for the further development of Pd nanostructure based applications. The detailed characterization of physical and optical properties of Pd nanostructures, growth mechanism and choice of growth conditions can be a compelling finding for many catalytic, optical and energy devices. As an example, the Pd NPs supported on oxides are widely utilized in various catalytic applications and their physical (shape, size, density, crystallinity, etc.), electronic and chemical properties are affected by the support and, therefore, the corresponding performance of the system is affected. Therefore, in this work, we investigate the evolution of configuration, size and density of Pd nanostructures on sapphire(0001) in detail by the control of the Pd deposition amount (DA) at various annealing temperatures. The dimension of dome shaped Pd NPs evolves from very small (dense) to medium and to large along with the compensation of density and nano-gaps between NPs. On the other hand, irregular coalesced Pd nanostructures and voids are observed at increased deposition amounts owing to the coalescence growth and limited diffusion. Depending on the variation of DA, the shape, size and density evolution of Pd NPs are discussed on the basis of the Volmer–Weber growth model, surface energy minimization mechanism, coalescence growth and limited diffusion mechanisms. Furthermore, the effect on the sapphire(0001) lattice and optical properties are analyzed by Raman and reflectance spectra.
Experimental section
Synthesis of Pd nanostructures on sapphire
To study the systematic evolution of Pd nanostructures on sapphire, 430 μm thick sapphire(0001) wafers with an off-axis ±0.1° (iNexus Inc., South Korea) were utilized. Firstly, the substrates were diced and mounted on a holder and then degassed in a pulsed laser deposition (PLD) chamber at 600 °C for 900 s below 1 × 10−4 Torr. After degassing, the surface contaminants and residual gaseous particles were removed from the surface. The Raman spectra of bare sapphire at various power values with laser excitation of 532 nm are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Distinctly, 6 Raman modes from the sapphire at 377.3, 416.3, 428.1, 447.6, 575.8 and 749.3 cm−1 were detected, which resemble the spectrum of natural sapphire. After degassing, the samples were ready for the deposition and fabrication of Pd nanostructures. Various thicknesses of Pd layers were deposited on the sapphire by controlling the deposition time, at a growth rate of 0.05 nm s−1 with the ionization current of 3 mA under 1 × 10−1 Torr in a plasma ion-coater by sputtering. In general, the Pd atoms were uniformly distributed throughout the surface and the surface roughness was gradually increased with Pd thickness, as shown in Fig. S2 and S3 (ESI†). (SAR and RMS roughness (Rq) values are summarized in Table S1, ESI.†) The annealing of samples was systematically performed at various temperatures, namely 750, 800 and 850 °C, in the PLD chamber under 1 × 10−4 Torr. To reach the target temperature, the linear ramping rate of 4 °C s−1 was controlled by a computer based recipe program. For each annealing temperature, samples with various Pd thicknesses ranging from 1 to 200 nm were prepared and annealed for an equal duration of 450 s after reaching the target. Other parameters were strictly kept identical to maintain the consistency of growths throughout the series. To prevent undesired Ostwald ripening, the annealing temperature was immediately reduced to the ambient temperature after each growth. The venting of air into the system was at below 170 °C and kept constant for all the samples.
Characterization of Pd nanostructures on sapphire
An atomic force microscope (AFM) (Park Systems Corp., XE-70, South Korea) with non-contact mode was employed to characterize the surface morphologies of the samples. The same type of AFM tips with the radius of curvature ∼10 nm, height 17 μm and resonant frequency ∼270 kHz were utilized throughout the scanning process for consistency and minimal tip effect. By using the XEI software of Park Systems, the acquired data were analyzed and prepared in the form of AFM top-views, side-views, cross-sectional line profiles and fast Fourier transform (FFT) spectra. The large-scale surface morphology of the samples was obtained by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (COXEM, CX-200, South Korea). For the elemental analysis, an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Noran System 7, USA) with spectral mode was used. The Raman spectra measurements of the samples were performed using the UNIRAM II system (UniNanoTech Co. Ltd, South Korea). The reflectance spectra were obtained using a UV-VIS-NIR spectrometer from Andor Technology, which was excited by a combined deuterium and halogen light source (Ocean Optics).
Results and discussion
Self-assembled Pd nanostructures on sapphire(0001) at 850 °C

Fig. 1 shows the evolution of various configurations of self-assembled Pd nanostructures on sapphire(0001) by the systematic control of deposition amounts at a constant annealing temperature (850 °C) and annealing duration (450 s). The general evolution of Pd nanostructures due to the addition of the deposition amount was observed by atomic force microscope (AFM) scanning in terms of AFM top-views, 3-D side-views, cross-sectional line profiles and 2-D FFT spectra in Fig. 1 and 2. The quantitative analysis of round isolated Pd NPs and large scale SEM images of the samples with relatively higher DAs are presented in Fig. 3 and 4, respectively. Generally, at low DAs, densely packed small Pd NPs were identified and when the DA was increased, they were gradually grown larger and eventually isolated from each other. Within the range of Pd DAs of 1 and 200 nm, the evolution of Pd nanostructures demonstrated 5 distinct regimes: the formation of round dome shaped small NPs between 1 to 3 nm, medium NPs between 5 to 20 nm, large NPs between 30 to 40 nm, merged Pd nanostructures between 50 to 80 nm and, eventually, void formation on Pd layer between 100 to 200 nm. The fabrication of various configurations, size and density of Pd nanostructures on sapphire can be commenced by the solid-state dewetting of the deposited thin film.24 Generally, the as-deposited Pd thin films on sapphire can be in an unstable state, and they will agglomerate into particles or droplets when thermally annealed below the melting point. At high thermal energy of 850 °C, Pd adatoms can diffuse into low energy sites such as vacancies, steps, grain boundaries, etc. with sufficient diffusion energy. Thus, the agglomeration of Pd adatoms can result in the formation of Pd NPs driven by the reduction of the surface free energy. From thermodynamic diffusion theory, the surface diffusion coefficient is a function of the annealing temperature and the relation with the diffusion length is expressed by the equation , where Ds is the surface diffusion coefficient, t is the residual time and Ld is the surface diffusion length. Again, Ds is expressed by the relation Ds ∝ exp(−En/KTa), where En is the diffusion barrier, K is the Boltzmann constant and Ta is the annealing temperature.25,26 As we applied identical annealing temperatures to all the samples in the series, the diffusion length can be expected to be a constant. On the other hand, void perturbation can be initiated from the low energy sites and subsequently grow larger depending on the temperature and film thickness: void growth rate , where tf is the initial film thickness. Therefore, with increased initial film thickness, the void growth can be reduced and vice versa; in this way, the overall dewetting process can be slowed down. Owing to the sufficient diffusion at 850 °C of annealing, the evolution of self-assembled 3-D Pd NPs with variable DAs can be explained in reference with the Volmer–Weber growth mechanism. The interaction between Pd–Pd relative to Pd–sapphire can be expressed as W = Es/Eb, where Es is the bond energy between Pd atoms and sapphire atoms and Eb is the bond energy between two Pd atoms. The Volmer–Weber growth mode exists when W < 1, that is, the Pd–Pd interaction is stronger with Es < Eb.27,28 Upon the addition of Pd DA, comparatively larger Pd NPs can merge with the nearby small NPs by absorbing the diffusing Pd adatoms to grow larger in order to reach the equilibrium state. Thus, the Pd NPs size consistently grew with increased DA as the large NPs are energetically more stable. Meanwhile, the Pd NPs tend to maintain morphological thermal stability by adopting the dome shape with reduced surface free energy.26 The rate of diffusion is inversely related to the thickness of the deposited film and mass of the NPs; as a result, elongated and irregular NPs can be formed.29 Further, larger NPs tend to absorb smaller ones, and the weak attractive force between NPs leads to coalescence. This effect becomes more severe with further addition of Pd, resulting in voids formation with relatively thicker Pd layers. The configuration and size evolution of Pd nanostructures based on DA control can be explained more specifically with the following five regimes.

Deposition thickness from 1 to 5 nm
Initially, at 1 nm of Pd film thickness, small but still isolated NPs were formed on sapphire. At 850 °C, the thin Pd layer (1 nm) was sufficiently diffused and the nucleation of isolated small NPs was observed, as seen in the AFM top-views in Fig. 1(a) and 2(a). When the DA was increased to 3 nm, the size enlargement of the Pd NPs was realized, whereas the density was decreased, as shown in Fig. 1(b) and 2(b). As the DA increased, the concentration of Pd atoms also increased, which helped the growth of the once formed nuclei. On the other hand, comparatively large NPs tend to attract nearby adatoms and small NPs in order to gain the equilibrium configuration and, therefore, the NPs grow larger, which ultimately decreases the density.29 The size and density evolution can be proceeded by the self-assembly of Pd NPs due to the short-range intermolecular forces. For both initial film thicknesses, the Pd NPs were found to adopt the semi-spherical or dome shape, which can be the approach of NPs to minimize surface energy by the isotropic distribution over all the directions.30 The dimensional enhancement of Pd NPs was also depicted by the increased height of cross-sectional line profiles in Fig. 2(a-1) and (b-1). The 2-D FFT power spectra in the insets, which is obtained by the Fourier filter transform of AFM images showed large isotropic pattern denoting random and wide distribution of NPs height.31 The height data in the AFM images are represented by a peak in the FFT power spectrum; therefore, wide height distribution means large FFT pattern and vice versa. For 3 nm thickness, the FFT pattern was shrunk toward the center due to the increased height range. For the detailed investigation of size evolution, the diameter and height measurements of ∼100 NPs per sample were performed by selecting a typical region. The measurements are presented in terms of histograms with the Gaussian distribution curves in Fig. 3. The peak of the Gaussian distribution curve represents the average NPs height and diameter and the corresponding average values are assigned in each plot, which is equivalent to the calculated value of the average height and diameter. In addition, the average height, average lateral diameter and average density with respect to DA are shown in Fig. 5(a) and (c) and summarized in Table S3 (ESI†). Between 1 and 3 nm, Pd NPs showed an extensive vertical growth in comparison to its lateral size; i.e. average NPs diameters increased from 30.32 to 37.38 nm (i.e. 19.57%), whereas the average NP height increased from 3.20 to 6.64 nm (52.46%). Meanwhile, the Pd NP density decreased from 5.04 × 1010 to 3.94 × 1010 per cm2. Further, the evolution of NPs was observed by Rq that provides the average surface height deviation from the mean plane and SAR that provides the increment of surface area (3D) as compared to geometric area (2D). Both parameters increased from 0.67 to 1.14 nm and from 0.21 to 1.16%, respectively, for the thickness variation from 1 to 3 nm. Detailed values at specific DAs are listed in the ESI,† Table S2 and represented by the plots in Fig. 5(d) and (e). Both surface parameters support the morphological enhancements with their increasing values due to the size and density increments of Pd NPs.

Error bars for the AH, LD and AD are ±5% in (a), (b) and (c). 
Deposition thickness from 5 to 20 nm
When the DA increased further, i.e. from 5 to 20 nm, medium dome Pd NPs were formed. In this regime, the Pd NPs consistently grew larger with the compensation of density, as shown in the AFM top-views and side-views in Fig. 1(c–f) and 2(c–f). In comparison with the previous regime, completely isolated NPs with significant inter-spacing between NPs (nano-gaps) was observed. As discussed, with the higher DA, the NPs grow larger due to the atomic abundancy and tendency to attract nearby diffusing adatoms, which leads to the fabrication of medium size NPs with the overall reduction of density.32,33 With 5 and 10 nm deposition thickness, all the NPs formed were not uniform and relatively small Pd NPs were also present along with medium NPs. However, the number of small NPs was less and size uniformity got better with added DA between 15 and 20 nm. The average height of the cross-sectional line-profiles in Fig. 2(c-1)–(f-1) also shows the increased size of NPs. Similarly, the FFT spectra shrunk continuously in succeeding samples as the height distribution of Pd NPs was reduced with the size uniformity. The diameter and height distribution histogram as well as Gaussian distribution curves also depicted the size evolution by shifting the peak position to the right, as shown in Fig. 3(c)–(f) and (c-1)–(f-1). The Pd NPs fabricated with 5 nm deposition acquired the average height, lateral diameter and average density of 12.78 nm, 59.16 nm and 1.54 × 1010 cm−2, respectively. When the incremental intensification in DA reached 20 nm, the average height, lateral diameter and density of NPs increased to 47.44 nm, 173.93 nm and 1.4 × 109 cm−2, respectively. Similar to the previous case, the height evolution of Pd NPs was more prominent in comparison to lateral growth. On the other hand, Rq increased from 4.919 to 16.875 nm due to the formation of randomly dispersed medium Pd NPs. The SAR increased up to 10 nm of DA and later decreased significantly for 15 and 20 nm, as shown in Fig. 8(e). The density reduction due to the absorption of relatively small NPs by large NPs or merging can be the reason for the decreased SAR.
Deposition thickness from 20 to 40 nm
As a consequence of additional DA, the large Pd NPs were witnessed within 30 to 40 nm, as shown in Fig. 1(g), (h) and 2(g), (h). Since the DA was varied largely, the size of Pd NPs also evolved considerably, resulting in large dome shaped NPs on the c-plane sapphire. With the increment of DA, the Pd NPs further grew by absorbing nearby small NPs in order to obtain the equilibrium configuration with minimum surface energy.34 At the same time, Pd NPs attained the dome or semi-spherical configuration and showed thermal stability with the isotropic energy distribution, regardless of size variation.35 In accordance with the previous observations, Ag thin films on sapphire(0001) also showed dome shape configurations, attaining sufficient surface diffusion.36 However, the dewetting extent of the Ag thin film was higher even at low annealing temperatures due to the high surface diffusivity of Ag than Pd. The average size and dome configuration of large Pd NPs are exploited by the cross-sectional line profiles, as shown in Fig. 3(g-1) and (h-1). The narrow height distribution of Pd NPs is reflected in the reduced size of FFT power spectra as seen in Fig. 2. Additionally, the corresponding large scale 3-D AFM side-views are shown in Fig. S4 and S5 (ESI†). The average height, average lateral diameter and average density at 30 nm were 66.44 nm, 238.51 nm and 5.78 × 107 cm−2, whereas at 40 nm, their respective values were 80.04 nm, 305.43 nm and 3.56 × 107 cm−2. Results show that the average height increased by 17.61%, while the average lateral width increased by 21.91% along with the change in the DA from 30 nm to 40 nm. In this case, the size and density evolution generally followed an inverse relation to each other. In contrast to the previous results in regime I and regime II, the lateral expansion was more substantial than the vertical growth for high deposition variations within 30 to 40 nm. The Rq value was consistently increased from 24.753 to 26.054 nm as the surface average height was amplified by the formation of large NPs. The SAR was further decreased at 30 nm in comparison to 20 nm due to the decreased density with the formation of large NPs. However, at 40 nm, it was exceptionally increased, which can be likely due to the extensive size expansion (lateral) of NPs.
Deposition thickness from 50 to 80 nm
At high DAs between 50 and 80 nm, the Pd NPs showed coalescence growth. For example, at 50 nm of DA, the Pd NPs started to collide and formed elongated NPs, which continued up to 80 nm; finally, irregular Pd nanoclusters resulted at 80 nm. As mentioned earlier, large NPs attract nearby smaller NPs and adatoms to become larger, unless they reach equilibrium. The attractive force can become significant with the larger NPs due to which self-assembly can begin to reach an equilibrium configuration with the minimum surface energy. Therefore, the Pd NPs grew larger possessing lower surface energy, which can be further assisted by the collision of small NPs due to their high mobility.37 However, due to the large size, the dome configuration may not be stable and, thus, NPs can form facets or even tend to elongate laterally. As a result, NPs can coalesce together to form elongated and merged nanostructures.38 In reference to the previous observation, the Pd surface diffusion was slower than Ag surface diffusion on sapphire due to which the Pd NPs’ size and density were smaller as compared to those of Ag NPs. Furthermore, the Pd nanostructures were not well separated and spherical even at high annealing temperatures, whereas the Ag film diffused very well even at lower temperatures.39 The surface morphologies of these Pd nanostructures are presented by AFM top-views, 3-D side-views, cross-sectional line-profiles and FFT power spectra. Fig. 1(i)–(k) and 2(i)–(k) show the large Pd NPs with top-view images and 3-D side-views (ESI†). Furthermore, the corresponding large scale surface morphology of the samples was obtained by SEM images in Fig. 4(a)–(c), which demonstrated the coalescence growth of Pd NPs. With 50 nm of deposition, the surface was nearly equally occupied with the elongated and round shaped Pd NPs; this may be due to the partial coalescence of Pd NPs. When the DA was increased to 65 and 80 nm, round/regular shaped Pd NPs gradually disappeared leaving behind irregular Pd nanoclusters as the coalescence phenomenon became constructive with higher DA. Cross-sectional line profiles represent the growth of nanostructures with the increased average height at higher DA. The FFT power spectra pattern was slightly enlarged as the overall height distribution was slightly decreased due to the coalesced Pd NPs. The Rq value was increased consistently, whereas SAR was drastically reduced as the density was further reduced by the coalescence of Pd NPs.
Deposition thickness from 100 to 200 nm
When the deposition was increased further, i.e. between 100 and 200 nm, the voids were fabricated on the Pd layer, as shown in Fig. 1(l)–(p). At 100 nm, large voids were perforated on the Pd layer, which gradually decreased in size with the addition of Pd. Finally, small pores/voids were obtained at 200 nm. Regardless of the constant annealing temperature at 850 °C and annealing duration for 450 s, the diffusion rate can be highly influenced by the deposited amount of Pd.40 The surface diffusion of Pd adatoms can be prevented or the stability of the thin film can be increased due to the high thickness and the dewetting process could not be sufficient to form isolated NPs. This effect becomes more severe for thicker films, resulting in only tiny pores or voids. The size and density of those voids were further reduced at higher DA, as shown in the SEM images in Fig. 4(d)–(f), which show the transformation of nano-voids. In addition, the corresponding AFM top-views and 3-D side-views along with line profiles and FFT spectra are shown in Fig. S6 and S7 (ESI†). The cross-sectional line profiles revealed the depth of voids in the Pd layer, and the void depth was found to diminish for high DA. Furthermore, the height randomness was enhanced by the formation of voids on the partially dewetted Pd layers, which was revealed by the enlarged bright spot of the FFT pattern. The Rq and SAR values were abruptly attenuated as the surface possessed low average height evolution from the mean plane and the isolated 3D growth of Pd NPs was not accomplished.
EDS spectra of Pd nanostructures at 850 °C

Fig. 6 depicts the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) spectra for the elemental analysis of Pd nanostructures fabricated on sapphire based on DA variations. A comparative analysis of the EDS spectra was used to demonstrate the variation of elemental composition in the samples with a distinct thickness of Pd layer, as shown in Fig. 6(a)–(d). The peaks detected within the spectral range of 0–5.5 keV revealed the presence of palladium, oxygen and aluminum in the samples. The spectral counts of intense peaks corresponding to palladium (Pd Lα1) were plotted with respect to DA variation in Fig. 5(f). In general, the Pd peaks were gradually increased, which ensured gradually increased amount of Pd even though the samples exhibited various morphologies. Fig. 6(a-1)–(d-1) show the details of Pd peaks: Pd Lα1 at 2.846 keV and Pd Lβ1 at 2.993 keV. From the quantitative analysis of the spectral count of Pd Lα1, the count reached approximately 243 to 11540 when the DA was varied from 1 to 200 nm, as shown in Fig. 8(f). The spectral count and peak height were consistently increased, revealing the DA of Pd on each sample.

Raman spectra of Pd nanostructures at 850 °C

Fig. 7 shows the Raman spectra and plots of intensity, peak shift and full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the samples after fabricating distinct configurations of Pd nanostructures. Detailed values are summarized in Table S4 (ESI†). The Raman spectra were obtained in a backscattering configuration at room temperature with the excitation laser of 532 nm (λ) at 100 mW. Six Raman bands at 377.3, 416.3, 428.1, 447.6, 575.8 and 749.3 cm−1 of active phonons were observed in bare sapphire(0001). Here, the most intense peak detected at 416.3 cm−1 was due to A1g and the others were due to the Eg phonon modes.41,42 The intensity of the Raman peaks, shift and FWHM were altered based on the surface morphology of the Pd nanostructures, and the modulation of such properties was discussed on the basis of the A1g vibration mode. In general, the peak intensity was weakened with the addition of DA, which can be clearly seen in Fig. 7(a) and (b). The incident laser interacts with the Pd nanostructures, which may suffer absorption, scattering as well as reflection, and the interaction with the sapphire lattice can be hindered. Therefore, the Raman intensity can vary depending upon the interaction of laser and sapphire. The Raman peaks were completely attenuated above 100 nm deposition thickness as the substrate was fully covered by Pd layers. Additionally, the plot of peak intensity clearly showed the decreasing trend with the deposition variation where bare sapphire exhibits the most intense peak among the samples in Fig. 7(b). The gradual left-shift caused by the fabricated Pd NPs is shown in the plot in Fig. 7(c), which can be due to the strain, lattice mismatch and disparity in the thermal expansion coefficient induced at the interface between the fabricated Pd nanostructures and substrate.43,44 Moreover, such effects can induce asymmetric broadening in the peak shape; as a result, the FWHM can be shifted.45,46

Reflectance spectra of Pd nanostructures at 850 °C

Fig. 8 depicts the reflectance spectra of the samples with the excitation of deuterium and halogen light in dark and ambient conditions. The samples were shone with deuterium and halogen light sources. Only specularly reflected light was detected as the light source and detector were perpendicular to the sample. The UV, VIS and NIR reflectance spectra range from 300 to 1000 nm. Bare sapphire(0001) showed almost uniform reflectance throughout the wavelength range and the average value was about ∼8.8%, as shown in Fig. 8(a). As compared to bare sapphire, the reflectance characteristics were gradually modulated after the fabrication of Pd nanostructures, as shown in Fig. 8(b)–(q), and the average reflectance can be discussed in close relation with the surface morphology evolution of Pd nanostructures. For example, for DAs between 1, 3 and 5 nm, the NPs were very small and, thus, the average reflectance was almost similar, although slightly increased, with increased DA. The increase in the average reflectance can be due to the enhanced reflectance because of the high reflectivity of Pd NPs: surface coverage and size play major roles.47 For example, the incident photon can be scattered randomly from the highly dense and very small NPs rather than reflected; however, with increased size or surface coverage of Pd NPs, the light reflection can be efficient, which yields increased average reflectance and vice versa. Consequently, when the DA increased from 10 to 20 nm, the average reflectance was further amplified with the formation of medium sized NPs. However, for the 30 and 40 nm DA, the reflectance was slightly reduced, which can be attributed to the effect of wide spacing between the large NPs. Similarly, the average surface coverage was also decreased. For the elongated and irregular Pd nanoclusters, the average surface coverage was gradually increased, resulting in reflectance amplification. As expected, after the formation of only voids on the Pd layers, the average reflectance was drastically increased, as shown in the plot in Fig. 8(r). In the case of highly dense small and medium NPs, no discernible absorption occurred, which can be possibly due to the scattering of light. However, the peaks and valleys were developed for widely spaced large NPs such as a peak started to appear at ∼390 nm with 10 nm deposition, whereas the valley in the VIS region became observable with 20 nm deposition, which is likely caused by the absorption enhancement by the surface plasmon resonance of Pd NPs.48 The range of the absorption band (dip) in the VIS region was widened with the size of Pd NPs. Meanwhile, a shoulder was formed in the VIS to NIR region possibly due to the higher absorption of shorter wavelengths due to surface plasmon resonance. Specifically, for widely spaced large Pd NPs and nanoclusters between 40–80 nm depositions, the NIR portion of the spectra showed much higher reflectance and strong absorption in the VIS regions. With the further increased depositions between 100 and 200 nm, the NIR shoulder became weaker with the formation of the Pd layer. The specific average reflectance values are summarized in Table S5 (ESI†).

Self-assembled Pd nanostructures on sapphire(0001) at 800 and 750 °C

Fig. 9 and 10 show the fabrication of various sized Pd NPs based on the Pd deposition variations ranging from 1 to 40 nm after annealing at 800 and 750 °C, respectively. In order to observe the effect of reduced annealing temperatures for the same deposition variation, the annealing of samples was performed at 800 and 750 °C for 450 s while keeping the other parameters identical. AFM top-views and size, density, Rq and SAR plots with respect to the deposition variation are analyzed to investigate the general morphological evolution of Pd NPs. As clearly seen in Fig. 9(a)–(h) and 10(a)–(h), the Pd NPs were grown from small to large with a dome shape rim. As compared to the previous result, at 850 °C, a similar evolution trend of Pd NPs was observed. The average height, lateral diameter and density were plotted with respect to the DA, as shown in Fig. 9(i), (j) and 10(i), (j) for 800 and 750 °C, respectively. The morphological evolution due to the formation of various sized Pd NPs is also determined by Rq and SAR in Fig. 9(k), (l) and 10(k), (l). Generally, the Pd NPs fabricated at 800 and 750 °C for 450 s showed a similar evolution trend with an identical growth mechanism for the deposition variation between 1 and 40 nm, as the surface diffusion was still favorable even with slightly lower annealing temperatures. The AFM side-views with different scales at 800 °C are presented in Fig. S8 and S9 (ESI†). Similarly, Fig. S13–S15 (ESI†) depict the AFM top- and side-views, line profiles and FFT power spectra of samples at 750 °C and depositions as labeled. The lower temperature effect on the surface diffusion was more clearly pronounced with higher DA. The large scale SEM images of the samples between 50 to 200 nm at 750 °C in Fig. 10(m)–(p) reveal voids formation. This result can be compared with the samples between 50 to 200 nm at 850 °C to clearly understand the change in diffusivity with the variations of annealing temperatures. In the case of annealing temperature of 850 °C, voids appeared only after the deposition of 100 nm; however, at 750 °C, the voids were formed even at 50 nm due to the further limited diffusion energy. The diffusion and nucleation of the deposited atoms can be slowed down due to lower temperature as the surface diffusion is directly correlated to temperature. The samples fabricated at 800 and 750 °C were determined by the EDS spectra and spectral count of intense Pd peaks, namely Pd Lα1, as shown in Fig. S10, S17 and S18 (ESI†). These showed quite similar behaviors as compared to the samples at 850 °C. The optical measurements by the Raman intensity for these lower temperature sets are also shown in Fig. S11 and S19 (ESI†) and the measured values are listed in Table S4 (ESI†). As illustrated in the figures, the intensities of the peaks were gradually decreased in the succeeding samples along with the increased deposition, which was in good agreement with the previous result. Also, the peaks were left-shifted, which is shown by the gradual decrement in the shift plots. As discussed earlier, this can be due to the mismatch between the lattice and thermal expansion coefficients of Pd and sapphire.43,44 Similarly, the reflectance spectra are presented in Fig. S12 and S20 (ESI†) for the 800 and 750 °C temperature sets, respectively. The average reflectance increased up to 20 nm in both the cases due to the gradually increased size and surface coverage and slightly reduced with 30 and 40 nm DA due to the reduced surface coverage by the growth of Pd NPs. As discussed, the average surface coverage, size and shape of Pd nanostructures influence the average reflectance and peaks and valley formation in the spectral band. At 750 °C, the average reflectance was drastically enhanced above 50 nm as the morphology was already developed into a layer by the limited diffusion at a lower temperature.

The morphology and optical properties evolution of Pd nanostructures on sapphire(0001) has been demonstrated for a wide range of temperature and thickness variations with several novel structural configurations of Pd nanostructures and their optical signatures. The Pd NPs with dome configurations were fabricated between 1 and 40 nm for 750, 800 and 850 °C. Irregular and large Pd NPs were formed between 50 and 80 nm of thickness, whereas above 100 nm, only voids were formed. The void formation and growth were further reduced at low temperatures. The growth mechanism was quite consistent with the previous observations; however, the morphological evolution varied markedly as attributed to the different dewetting extents and metal and substrate properties such as diffusivity, surface and interface energies and crystal structures.
Summary and conclusion
In summary, the systematic evolution of various Pd nanostructures on sapphire(Al2O3) (0001) was demonstrated in terms of configuration, size and density as a function of DA. Semispherical or dome shaped Pd NPs were fabricated between 1 and 40 nm for three different temperatures (750, 800 and 850 °C). The evolution of Pd NPs was described based on the solid-state dewetting followed by the Volmer–Weber growth along with the surface energy minimization mechanism. Vertical growth was found to be prominent in the case of small and medium NPs, whereas large size NPs exhibited significant lateral expansion. Meanwhile, the morphological thermal stability with isotropic energy distribution was retained by the dome shape of Pd NPs. Irregular Pd nanostructures were formed between 50 and 80 nm thickness by the coalescence of NPs in order to minimize the surface free energy. Further, Pd voids were fabricated above 100 nm as the diffusion was limited by the Pd thickness. For a lower annealing temperature (750 °C), the void growth started at an even lower film thickness, i.e. 50 nm. The Raman measurements revealed the phonon characteristics of sapphire(0001) after the formation of Pd nanostructures, such as decreased peak intensity and left-shift, which were correlated to the surface morphology, lattice mismatch, stress and different thermal coefficients of Pd/sapphire systems. In addition, the influence on the optical properties such as average reflectance and absorption band were probed by the UV-VIS-NIR reflectance spectra. A more detailed study on the optical properties can be performed by using the transmission and absorption spectra. Furthermore, electrical properties can be probed by the I–V characteristic along with the optical characteristics. Finally, this work can provide a reference to fabricate the various configurations of Pd nanostructures employing a simple approach and the related properties can be further exploited for applications involving catalysis, nanophononics and electronics.
