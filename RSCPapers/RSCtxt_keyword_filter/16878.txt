Broader context
Organic semiconductors provide emerging technology for consumer electronics. Organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) have already entered the market as they offer more vibrant colors when compared to conventional liquid crystalline screens. Organic photovoltaics (OPV) promise flexible and inexpensive solar cells, which will find niche applications for smart power generation such as clothing, portable cellphone charges, and power generating windows. These devices convert electricity to light and light to electrical current using excited states called excitons. Dynamics of excitons determine key device performance characteristics such as power conversion efficiency of solar cells and brightness of OLEDs. This review summarizes recent experimental findings and basic concepts relevant to exciton diffusion in organic semiconductors.

1. Introduction
Organic semiconductors are carbon-based compounds that show semiconducting properties. Alternation of single and double bonds between carbon atoms – conjugation – is a common structural property of all organic semiconductors. This zigzag backbone usually adopts a planar conformation (Fig. 1a). Covalent bonds between carbon atoms of such a backbone are formed by three sp2 hybridized orbitals and one unhybridized orbital, which is commonly denoted as pz (ref. 1). Unhybridized orbitals pz provide electron clouds above and below the molecular plain. The adjacent pz orbitals overlap resulting in shared molecular orbitals that are often referred as extended π-system. Electrons on these orbitals are spatially delocalized meaning that they belong to the whole π-system, but not to specific carbon atoms. A π-system can be extended over the entire organic molecule or just over a part of it – a conjugated segment.
 Fig. 1  (a) A conjugated backbone with overlapping pz orbitals that point out of the molecular plane. (b) Highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO and LUMO). Arrows denote two electrons with different spins. 
In the ground state, electrons fill orbitals of the lowest energies with maximum two electrons of opposite spins per each orbital. The energetically highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO and LUMO) are very important for electrical conductivity and optical properties of organic semiconductors. They are often denoted as π and π* orbitals in π-systems, respectively (Fig. 1b). The energy difference between HOMO and LUMO is often referred as a band gap that typically values between 1.5 and 3.5 eV for organic semiconductors.
Excitons are energy chunks
The ground state of the majority of organic molecules is electrically neutral and has net spin zero. A molecule can be excited when an electron from the HOMO is promoted to the LUMO, for instance by absorption of a photon. The Jablonski diagram in Fig. 2 presents possible transitions between electronic states of an isolated molecule. These states are positioned vertically by their energy and grouped horizontally by spin multiplicity. Electronic states with net spin zero or one are called singlets or triplets, respectively. The arrow 1 represents the absorption of a photon that brings a molecule from the ground state S0 to the first singlet excited state S1; transitions to higher singlet excited states are also possible (not shown in Fig. 2). The transition 2 results in the emission of light and is called fluorescence. Triplet excited state T1 can be created via the intersystem crossing 4. The radiative transition 6 is called phosphorescence. Fluorescence and/or phosphorescence can be also referred as photoluminescence (PL) when these transitions are initiated by absorption of a photon. The non-radiative transitions 3 and 5 compete with fluorescence and phosphorescence. And finally transition 7 is the absorption of a photon that brings state T1 to higher triplet excited states Tn. This process can be used to detect triplet excitons in photoinduced transient absorption experiments.2 In some cases a singlet exciton can undergo a fission process resulting in two triplet excitons.3–14 For details on singlet fission please refer to review papers specified in references.15–18
 Fig. 2  The Jablonski diagram of electronic transitions in organic semiconductors. The energies of singlet (S0 and S1) and triplet (T1 and Tn) states are scaled vertically. Absorption (1), fluorescence (2), intersystem crossing (4), phosphorescence (6), nonradiative transitions (3 and 5) and photoinduced absorption (7) are presented as arrows. 
In organic solids, interactions of an excited molecule with neighbors impose reorganization of intermolecular distances and partial polarization of electronic configuration of the surrounding. This collective response to an excitation is called exciton or, in case of particularly strong interactions with surrounding, exciton-polaron.19,20 Excitons are electrically neutral and bear potential energy that can be released when the molecule returns to the ground state. Excitons with total spin of zero or one are called singlet or triplet, respectively. Although the Jablonski diagram in Fig. 2 describes isolated molecules, transitions in organic solids are usually similar. Therefore singlet and triplet excitons are often denoted as S1 and T1.
Two charged states – positive or negative polarons – can be created by subtraction from the HOMO or addition to the LUMO of an electron, respectively. Polaron entities include the charge and reorganization energy of the surrounding. Terms “hole” and “electron” are often used to denote positive and negative charges. An exciton can be described as a bound electron–hole pair, which is localized at a single conjugated segment. Such localization is due to relatively low dielectric constant of the organic medium resulting in a strong electrostatic attraction between the opposite charges. Furthermore, the excitonic wavefunction is usually localized at a single conjugated segment due to weak interactions between molecules in organic solids. The work needed to separate electron and hole of an exciton is called binding energy and is usually of the order of 0.3–0.5 eV for singlet excitons.21–23 The binding energy of triplets is higher due to the attractive exchange interaction between electron and hole of the same spin orientation.2
Triplet excitons cannot be directly generated by the absorption of a photon in organic semiconductors due to symmetry considerations of π orbitals. Thus the assistance of spin–orbit coupling and/or electron–phonon interaction are required to enable transitions such as the 4, 5 and 6 in Fig. 2. Organic semiconductors are composed of lightweight atoms such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur, which do not show strong spin–orbit coupling. Consequently, the transitions between excitonic states of different spin multiplicity are normally not efficient in this class of materials. Therefore triplet lifetime is usually about 6 orders of magnitude longer than that of singlets in organic semiconductors.
As a rule of thumb, the energy that is carried by a triplet exciton is usually 0.7 eV below that of singlet in a π system.2 However, it is also possible to design conjugated molecules that have similar singlet and triplet energies.24,25 In such systems the intersystem crossing 4 and the reverse process is more likely to occur and these molecules show a phenomenon of temperature activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Please refer to ref. 26 and 27 for detailed review on TADF compounds.
Energy and charge transfer
An exciton can be relocated from an exited “donor” molecule to an “acceptor” molecule via a non-radiative process of energy transfer. At the end of this process the donor molecule is in the ground state and the acceptor molecule is in the excited state. Energy transfer can occur via Förster (through-space) or Dexter (through-bond) mechanisms (Fig. 3a and b).28–30 The Förster mechanism is based on a dipole–dipole electromagnetic interaction and occurs when the emission spectrum of the donor has a significant overlap with the absorption spectrum of the acceptor. Therefore, this type of energy transfer is called Förster resonant energy transfer (FRET). The efficiency of FRET decreases with the distance r between donor and acceptor as r−6. Significant FRET can be typically observed for donor–acceptor separations in the range of 1–5 nm.30–32 Usually, only singlet excitons can be transferred via the Förster mechanism; however, a triplet exciton that is located at a phosphorescent donor also can undergo FRET.33–38 Förster energy transfer is commonly observed in photosynthesis when the energy of absorbed photons is channeled to the reaction center.
 Fig. 3  (a) Förster energy transfer. (b) Dexter energy transfer enables diffusion of triplet excitons. The horizontal lines are HOMO and LUMO energy levels of donor (D) and acceptor (A) molecules; the asterisk denotes excited state. The dashed arrows represent simultaneous rearrangement of the electronic configuration. (c) Electron transfer from an excited donor molecule (D*) to a neutral acceptor (A). 
Actual exchange of electrons between donor and acceptor takes place during the Dexter energy transfer (Fig. 3b).2,28,30 This may happen when donor and acceptor are only about 1 nm apart so there is a significant overlap of molecular orbitals. The probability of Dexter energy transfer exponentially decreases with the distance between donor and acceptor. Both singlet and triplet excitons may be transferred by this mechanism. FRET usually outperforms the efficiency of the Dexter energy transfer for singlet excitons, while triplets may be transferred between non-phosphorescent molecules only by the Dexter mechanism.
Electron and hole, which are coulombically bound in an exciton, can be separated when their binding energy is overcome. Such a separation can be efficient at the interface with an electron accepting material. If the energy of the LUMO of the acceptor is significantly lower than the LUMO of the excited donor molecule, then electron transfer from donor to acceptor may take place (see Fig. 3c). This process is called charge transfer; it is a short-range interaction that takes place when there is a significant spatial overlap between wavefunctions of the donor and acceptor molecules. As a result of the electron transfer donor and acceptor are positively and negatively charged, respectively. Hole transfer is also possible when the energy levels of a donor and an acceptor are properly aligned. The physical mechanism of this process is the same as that of the electron transfer.
Excitons in opto-electronic devices
The working principle of organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) is based on the generation of excitons. Electrons and holes are injected into an organic semiconductor, which serves as active layer for the OLED. Excitons are created when electron and hole meet each other in the active layer. According to the quantum mechanical rules of momentum addition, 25% of all excitons created in this way are singlets and 75% are triplets. The radiative recombination of triplet excitons is not very probable, thus only singlet excitons may contribute to the emitted light that limits the internal quantum efficiency of an OLED to 25%.2,39 In some materials with low charge carrier mobility, the formation of singlet excitons may be somewhat more or less favorable due to the hyperfine fields, which are caused by magnetic field of hydrogen nuclei.40–49 Nevertheless, in order to achieve highly performing OLEDs triplet excitons should be manipulated toward radiative recombination.2,50–54 In this respect, it is highly important to study the dynamics of both singlet and triplet excitons in order to improve the performance of organic OLEDs.
Semiconductor (donor)-fullerene (acceptor) heterojunctions are commonly used in organic solar cells to separate electrons and holes.55–62 In the simplest case the active layer of an organic solar cell consists of a bilayer semiconductor–fullerene heterojunction (Fig. 4). The semiconductor plays the role of a light absorber in which singlet excitons are generated fairly homogeneously within the layer. The excitons undergo diffusion so that some of them will reach the interface with the fullerene, where the electron and hole are separated. These electrons and holes are then transported through the fullerene and organic semiconductor layer, respectively, and then extracted at the metallic electrodes of the solar cell resulting in a photocurrent. Excitons that are capable of reaching the fullerene interface may undergo dissociation. Therefore, the exciton diffusion length LD sets the geometrical constraints on the useful thickness of the semiconductor layer. Excitons that are created at longer distance than LD from the fullerene interface will not make a contribution to the photocurrent. Terao et al. showed an almost linear correlation between the short circuit current of a bi-layer solar cell and the exciton diffusion length.63 Menke et al. demonstrated that the power conversion efficiency of a bi-layer solar cell can be increased by 30% when exciton diffusion length is manipulated towards larger values.64
 Fig. 4  Exciton quenching due to charge transfer at the semiconductor (donor) – fullerene (acceptor) interface. Electrons and holes are denoted as (e) and (h). Conjugated segments are schematically depicted as pairs of HOMO–LUMO levels. 
Singlet exciton diffusion length of organic semiconductors typically falls into range of 5–10 nm (see Table 3), however a layer thickness of 100–200 nm is needed to efficiently absorb light. Therefore instead of bi-layer structures, bulk heterojunction solar cells are now routinely prepared. In these devices donor and acceptor materials are intermixed usually by dissolving the two materials in an organic solvent. When a film is cast from such a solution, the resulting phase separated morphology is quite complex and it is called bulk heterojunction. It has been shown that due to diffusion-limited exciton dissociation, a gradual reduction of the short circuit current is observed in a bulk heterojunction solar cell when the morphology was coarsened by means of thermal annealing.188 On the other hand, devices with optimal morphology, which is characterized by the phase separated domains of the order of 10 nm, are nearly insensitive to variations of exciton diffusion length.65 Unfortunately it is quite hard to achieve such optimal morphology in practice. Thus for the design efficient solar cells it is important to measure and control the exciton diffusion length.
2. Mechanism of exciton diffusion
In this section we focus on main Physical processes that are relevant for exciton diffusion. For vigorous theoretical description of exciton transport please refer to these excellent reviews2,18,23,66 and other peer-reviewed publications.67–87
Diffusion equation
Diffusion is a random motion of particles in space that leads to spreading from the areas of high concentration to the areas of low concentration. Normal diffusion can be described by the following equation: (1)where n is the concentration of particles, D is a diffusion coefficient, ∇2 is Laplace operator, and τ is the particle lifetime. The root mean square displacement of a particle from its initial position due to the diffusion process is called diffusion length, which is given by: (2)where dLi is the displacement of an exciton i from its original position, N is total number of excitons, and Z is equal to 1, 2 or 3 in case of one-, two- or three-dimensional diffusion, respectively.19 However, in the majority of scientific publications on exciton diffusion in organic semiconductors, the factor of two is omitted in eqn (2): (3) In this case the value LD is approximately equal to the average displacement of a particle from its initial position. To be consistent with the literature we will refer to the diffusion length that is given by the expression (3).
Amorphous and polycrystalline thin films of organic semiconductor are characterized by a significant degree of disorder, in particular when they are cast from solution. Variation of molecular conformations and size of conjugated segments (especially conjugated in polymers), inhomogeneity of intermolecular interactions, chemical defects and impurities, etc. lead to a Gaussian distribution of the HOMO–LUMO energy gaps – and excitonic energies. Förster or Dexter energy transfer facilitates exciton hopping among conjugated segments in solid organic material. Because of the inherent disorder, such a migration can be regarded as diffusion. Feron et al. showed that exciton hopping can be fully described in terms of random walk.78
Two steps in exciton diffusion

Fig. 5 schematically shows the key processes of exciton diffusion in a disordered medium, which for simplicity is considered to have a Gaussian distribution of excitonic energies with distribution width σ. Upon absorption of a photon, an exciton is created at a conjugated segment of certain energy. If conjugated segments with lower energy are available then the exciton starts a downhill migration via energy transfer toward the lower energy cites. For singlet excitons this process takes about 100 ps and can be observed by the bathochromic shift of the PL spectrum during this time.73,74,81,89–94 The downhill migration proceeds until excitons reach a quasi-equilibrium level of the most populated states, which is located at − σ2/kT below the center of the Gaussian density of states (DOS).95 The energy of this level can be measured by simply observing the position of the maximum of the PL spectrum (see Fig. 6b).
 Fig. 5  Exciton diffusion process at low and room temperatures. The excitonic Gaussian density of states is represented by the distribution of the excitonic energies. The exciton–phonon coupling determines the position of the energy level of the most populated states. (a) The downhill migration fully determines the exciton diffusion process at low temperatures.

Downhill migration and thermally activated hopping determine the temperature dependence of exciton diffusion length. When poly[2-methoxy-5-(3,7-dimethyloctyloxy)-1,4-phenylene-vinylene] (MDMO-PPV) is being cooled from room temperature down to ∼150 K thermally activated hopping becomes less important resulting in a decrease of diffusion length and diffusion coefficient (see Fig. 6a). At temperatures below 150 K excitons relax down to the bottom of the DOS where the density of lower lying states is insufficient for further downhill migration. Consequently, the level of the most populated states becomes temperature independent and since in this regime there is not enough of thermal energy for activated hopping, both D and LD become temperature independent.
The processes of downhill migration and thermally activated hopping can be observed for both singlet and triplet excitons (Fig. 5).68,74,75,79,81,88–90,92,93,96–112 Since triplet excitons undergo diffusion via short range Dexter energy transfer, the number of available hopping sites quickly becomes limited during the downhill migration. In strongly disordered systems sometimes one observes a blue shift of the maximum of phosphorescence spectrum upon cooling below 100 K.103,104 Using theoretical modeling Beljonne, Köhler, and co-authors showed that in materials with high degree of disorder, certain thermal activation is needed for triplets to find lower energy sites, resulting in the blue shift of PL spectrum upon cooling.81 This effect is called frustrated transport of triplet excitons and it is observed in conjugated polymers such as polyfluorene.
Strictly speaking downhill migration cannot be considered a normal diffusion that is described by eqn (1). As excitons approach the bottom of the excitonic DOS, the distance between hopping sites becomes larger, while it takes much longer time for each subsequent hop.72,106 Under these conditions the diffusion coefficient will vary in time from larger to smaller values.88,113 On the contrary, temperature activated hopping occurs among sites of similar energy at nearly constant site-to-site distances. Therefore, exciton migration can be regarded as a diffusion process above 150 K, where temperature activated hopping makes the dominant contribution.
Understanding Förster energy transfer
Since Förster energy transfer facilitates singlet exciton diffusion, we turn our attention to the factors that govern this process. The rate kF of Förster energy transfer between donor and acceptor chromophores is given by the following expression:114–117 (4)where τhop is the hopping time between the chromophores, τ0 is the intrinsic exciton lifetime that is not limited by diffusion limited quenching at defects, d is the distance between the chromophores, and R0 is the Förster radius:116,117 (5) Here ΦPL is photoluminescence quantum yield; 0 ≤ κ2 ≤ 4 is dipole–dipole orientation factor; and n is the refractive index. The integral J over wavelength λ quantifies the spectral overlap between the area-normalized PL spectrum (area under the curve must be equal to unity) of donor FD(λ) and the absorption spectrum of acceptor expressed in terms of absorption cross-section σA(λ).19,116 Then the exciton diffusion coefficient D can be estimated using Smoluchowski–Einstein theory of random walks:118 (6)where A is a constant that accounts for the distribution of molecular separations d. The exciton diffusion length in a solid is then equal to: (7)Here τf is PL lifetime in a solid film, it may be different from τ0 due to diffusion-limited quenching at defects or even intentionally introduced quenchers in the solid medium. eqn (6) and (7) can be used to estimate exciton diffusion parameters in organic semiconductors.114,119–122
According to the expression (7), exciton diffusion length depends on the intermolecular spacing d, the PL quantum yield ΦPL, the orientation factor κ2, spectrally weighted refractive index n, the lifetime ratio τf/τ0, and the spectral overlap J. In order to improve LD, one has to engineer materials that optimize one or more of these parameters. The distance d can be varied in the range of 0.35–5 nm with the lower limit defined by the π–π stacking distance and the upper limit set by the Förster self-radius that typically values one or several nanometers in organic semiconductors.64,121,123 Thus, due to the inverse quadratic dependence, LD can be theoretically varied by two orders of magnitude by changing d. It has been shown however that optimization of PL quantum yield ΦPL and spectral overlap J may have a greater impact on the diffusion length than the variation of intermolecular distance.64 Dipole orientation factor κ2 can be maximized when all transition dipoles are aligned, achieving a maximum value of κ2 = 4. To put it into prospective, an amorphous film with randomly oriented dipoles is characterized by κ2 = 0.476. Therefore, by aligning all the dipoles in the most beneficial way, LD can be theoretically increased by ∼2.9 times compared to the amorphous material.115,124 Dipole alignment may occur naturally in single crystals; however, it is quite challenging to intentionally align them.124 The spectral overlap J is determined by the Stokes shift, meaning that materials with smaller red-shift of emission with respect to the absorption spectrum have a potential for higher LD. Interestingly, a higher refractive index n would lead to lower LD, even though a high n is desirable for efficient charge separation in organic solar cells. The ratio τf/τ0 depends on the amount of exciton quenching defects present in the film and approaches unity for highly pure materials. The PL quantum yield ΦPL is defined as (8)where kr is the radiative decay rate and knr is a sum of all non-radiative decay paths, excluding the diffusion-limited exciton quenching at defects. ΦPL can be increased when the non-radiative decay rate knr is reduced and/or when radiative decay rate kr is increased.
It is important to note that there is no explicit temperature dependence in the expression (7). For two isolated chromophores at fixed separation d the temperature dependent parameters would be ΦPL and J. At lower temperatures, the rate of non-radiative decay paths are usually reduced resulting in higher PL quantum yield ΦPL. The increase of ΦPL would compete with decrease of J due to reduction of inhomogeneous broadening upon cooling. Thus these effects alone would not explain the temperature dependence of exciton diffusion in solid film such as observed in MDMO-PPV (see Fig. 6).
The temperature dependence of the exciton diffusion length is mainly determined by the intermolecular separation d between excitonic sites that take part in temperature activated hopping (see Fig. 5). If thermal quasi-equilibrium can be reached during the exciton lifetime then the distance between chromophores at the energy level of the most populated states after downhill migration is:95 (9)where neq is density of excitonic states with energy at the quasi-equilibrium level, N0 is the total density of available excitonic states that is on the order of 1021 cm−3 for organic semiconductors. To illustrate the importance of the temperature dependence of deq we consider MDMO-PPV with known disorder parameter σ = 44 meV (ref. 88). Fig. 7a shows that deq increases upon reduction of the temperature and below 150 K it quickly becomes larger than the range of Förster energy transfer, i.e. 1–5 nm. Therefore, the transition between the two regimes of exciton diffusion occurs at this temperature (see Fig. 6a).
 Fig. 7  (a) Temperature dependence of inter-chromophore distance d at the quasi-equilibrium level for MDMO-PPV. (b) Dependence of d on the disorder parameter σ at room temperature. The curves were obtained using eqn (9). 

Expression (9) also highlights the impact of disorder on exciton diffusion. Materials with higher disorder parameter σ show higher deq as it is presented in Fig. 7b for room temperature. Consequently exciton diffusion is usually higher in more ordered materials. Fig. 7b suggests that thermally activated hopping at room temperature can be only observed in materials with σ < 80 meV, at which deq is within the range of Förster energy transfer. It is important to note that the excitonic disorder parameter σ is usually ∼2 times smaller than the disorder parameter extracted from charge transport measurements.88,125
In amorphous films of conjugated polymers, it is observed that exciton diffusion is isotropic.126,127 However, in organic crystals, both singlet and triplet exciton transport appears to be highly anisotropic due to Bravais lattices with low degree of symmetry such as triclinic systems with several molecules per unit cell.19 Anisotropy of singlet exciton diffusion is also enhanced by the strong dependence of the Förster energy transfer rate on their mutual orientation of participating chromophores.84,115,124,128–130 Dexter energy transfer strongly relies on the spatial overlap of the wavefunctions of the excited states at neighboring molecules. Such overlaps are also highly anisotropic in organic crystals, having the highest values at π–π stacking direction.
Exciton–exciton annihilation
High exciton densities and diffusion processes give rise to a high probability of two excitons meeting each other during their lifetimes. Exciton–exciton annihilation occurs when the interaction between these two excitons leads to a non-radiative recombination of at least one of them.2,131–136 For instance, annihilation of two singlet (S1) or two triplet (T1) excitons may result in a ground state (S0) and a singlet exciton: S1 + S1 → S0 + S1,(10) T1 + T1 → S0 + S1.(11) Other products of exciton annihilation are also possible.137 Efficient triplet exciton annihilation (11) requires anti-parallel spins of triplet excitons due to the conservation law of angular momentum. Singlet excitons that are created as the result of triplet exciton annihilation (11) may decay radiatively. Such emission is called delayed fluorescence because it can be observed after a pulsed laser excitation at times much longer than the PL decay time.2,26,98,99,102,131,133,134,138–153
Exciton–exciton annihilation can be described mathematically by the following modification of the eqn (1): (12) γ = 4πRaD;(13)where γ is the annihilation rate constant, Ra is the annihilation radius – the average distance between two excitons that undergo annihilation, and G is the exciton generation rate.
Under conditions of continuous and homogeneous generation G = const we can set ∂n/∂t = 0 and ∇2n = 0 in eqn (12): (14)leading to the steady state solution:135 (15)Fig. 8 shows an example plot of eqn (15) when 4γτ2 = 0.01 (circles). The dependence consists of two straight lines with slopes 1 and 0.5. In a log–log graph a straight line denotes function in a form of y = cxα, where α is the slope of that line. Slope 1 denotes linear dependence n ∝ G at generation intensities smaller than a certain threshold value G0. The square root dependence  at G > G0 indicates the exciton–exciton annihilation. The threshold generation rate can be estimated from eqn (15): (16)
 Fig. 8  Simulated exciton density (circles) versus the exciton generation rate using eqn (15). 
The expression (16) shows that the exciton–exciton annihilation is a more important decay process for triplets than for singlets because of the long triplet lifetime τ. Triplet–triplet annihilation can be observed by recording the dependence of the phosphorescence intensity or the photoinduced absorption intensity (transition 7 in Fig. 2) on the generation rate G,102,154 or by observing delayed fluorescence – emission of singlet excitons that are a product of the process shown in expression (11).2,26,98,99,102,131,133,134,138–153
Diffusion limited exciton quenching
Excitons can be quenched in several ways leading to the reduction of the exciton density, PL intensity, and PL decay time. Exciton quenching is a very important process in operation of devices and for studying exciton dynamics. The energy of an excited state can be trapped during the diffusion process on defects that are always present in thin films of organic semiconductors. Trapped excitons are usually quenched since the defects often do not show photoluminescence. Strong quenching has been observed in the vicinity of metal interfaces.155 Exciton dissociation into non-radiative species such as free electrons and holes also leads to quenching. Inhomogeneous regions in amorphous films of higher molecular density, as expressed in g cm−3etc., show higher rates of exciton quenching.156–159 Furthermore, exciton quenching has been also observed at grain boundaries of polycrystalline materials.160

Fig. 4 illustrates the dissociation of an exciton at the semiconductor (electron donor) – fullerene (electron acceptor) interface. In the most common situation the LUMO of fullerenes is significantly lower than the LUMO of many organic semiconductors.32 Thus electron transfer to the fullerene is energetically favorable, which leads to exciton quenching. Exciton quenching due to charge transfer at the semiconductor–fullerene interface is reported to be at the time scale of 45 fs, which is much shorter than the typical exciton lifetime (∼0.5 ns). Therefore, fullerenes can be considered as perfect exciton quenchers for donor semiconductors.161
3. Measuring singlet exciton diffusion length
The singlet exciton diffusion length is typically reported in the range of 5–20 nm in amorphous and polycrystalline organic semiconductors.31,55,63,88,114,126,127,155,156,160,162–180Table 3 summarizes exciton diffusions of various organic semiconductors and methods used to measure them. It is not entirely clear why the exciton diffusion length is so similar in such a broad selection of materials. What factors influence the exciton diffusion length? And finally how do these factors – and the exciton diffusion length itself – correlate with the performance of solar cells and LEDs? To answer these questions systematic measurements of exciton diffusion lengths are needed in materials with various chemical composition, morphology and performances in devices.63,128,160,171 In the following we summarize the available methods and discuss the advantages and pitfalls of each technique. Lin et al. provided a comprehensive comparison of most of these methods by applying them to a set of small molecule compounds.121Table 1 summarizes key features of each approach to measure singlet exciton diffusion length.

Fluorescence quenching in bilayers
Perhaps the most popular method to measure singlet exciton diffusion length is based on PL quenching in bilayers.31,63,88,127,156,164,166,167,169,170,173,178,181–184 In this method one of the interfaces of a thin film is brought into contact with an exciton quenching layer (Fig. 9). Fullerenes or TiO2 are commonly used as “quenching wall”. If the thickness of the organic layer is of the order of the exciton diffusion length, then a large fraction of the excitons will be able to reach the “quenching wall” via diffusion. Consequently, the PL decay time of such a sample will be shorter than in an isolated film. The measured PL decays are then fitted using a simple model that is based on eqn (1), yielding the exciton diffusion length. Examples of such models can be found in ref. 88, 169, 173 and 179.
 Fig. 9  Bilayer structure for exciton diffusion measurement. The organic semiconductor is deposited on top of an exciton-quenching layer. (Adapted with permission from ref. 88. Copyright 2008 American Chemical Society.) 
There are advantages and disadvantages of the bilayer method. On the positive side the modeling is straightforward with the exciton diffusion length as the only fitting parameter. The thickness of the semiconductor layer can be accurately measured using atomic force microscopy or ellipsometry. On the other hand the sample preparation is quite demanding because one needs to prepare a series of an organic semiconductor with various film thicknesses. Additionally, it may be challenging to prepare semiconductor layers as thin as 5 nm that are uniform in thickness and do not form pin-holes or other defects. Furthermore, all the interfaces should be sharp173 and ultra-flat; typically root mean square roughness of about 1 nm on the area of 100 μm2 is required for accurate measurement. The quenching efficiency of the “quenching wall” must be carefully evaluated to get an accurate measurement.167 The effects of optical interference169,185 and variation of the exciton density due to optical absorption166 must be taken into account. Often PL decay times of isolated films also depend on the layer thickness even without the introduction of any quenchers.156,166,186 All these factors set limits to use the bilayer structure for systematic measurements of the exciton diffusion length.
If there is a significant overlap between the emission spectrum of the semiconductor and absorption spectrum of the quencher, then excitons can be quenched by a direct Förster energy transfer to the quenching molecule (see Fig. 3a). In some cases Förster energy transfer may become a dominant exciton-quenching pathway as opposed to the electron transfer. FRET may occur between chromophores at distances of 2–3 nm that is comparable to the exciton diffusion length. Therefore, this effect must be taking into account when modeling exciton diffusion in bilayers.31,64,114,120,169
The problematic thickness-dependent effects can be avoided in an alternative bilayer method.114,160,165,179,187,188 A thick film, typically of the order of micrometers, is capped either with an exciton blocking or exciton-quenching layer. This heterostructure is excited with monochromatic light at various wavelengths. Depending on the absorption cross-section at each wavelength, the exciton generation profile is modulated. By comparing the PL intensity of quenched and unquenched samples the exciton diffusion length can be extracted. The advantage of this method is that only two samples are needed for each material. However, the mathematical model is complex and this method works best when the variation of the generation profile is significant on the length scale of the exciton diffusion length. Therefore, it is most applicable for single crystals, which show extremely long exciton diffusion length.179,187 However, Bergemann et al. showed that this method can be used for optically thin films as well.189
Fluorescence volume quenching
In order to overcome the shortcomings of the bi-layer method, one can apply a fluorescence volume quenching technique of measuring exciton diffusion length.119,120,122,126,190–193 In this method, an organic semiconductor is mixed with small amounts of exciton quenching molecules, typically a fullerene derivative phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) at blend ratios of 0.001 – 5 wt%. Then the PL decay time is measured as a function of PCBM volume fraction. As the concentration of quenchers is increased, PL decay time becomes shorter due to the diffusion-limited quenching. This happens when the average distance between quenching molecules approaches the exciton diffusion length. By carefully controlling the concentration of PCBM one can get a handle of how far excitons are able to diffuse.
In order to get an accurate measurement of the exciton diffusion length using the fluorescence volume quenching method it is important to use the correct theoretical model to fit experimental results to extract exciton diffusion coefficient, and to control the nanoscale morphology of the semiconductor-quencher blends. In the most general case, the exciton diffusion in blends can be modeled using free open source Monte Carlo simulation.190,194 Samuel and co-workers modeled PL decays of semiconductor-quencher blends using the Smoluchowski equation.122,123 If the material shows monoexponential PL decays, one may apply a simple Stern–Volmer analysis.116,195–200 These modeling approaches allow extracting the exciton diffusion coefficient typically as the only fitting parameter.
For the sake of modeling, it is necessary that PCBM forms an intimate mixture with the semiconductor at various blend ratios where significant PL quenching is observed. The morphology of the semiconductor-PCBM blends can be probed by surveying a range of PCBM concentrations. If experimental data can be modeled with a single value of diffusion coefficient within a certain range of concentrations then PCBM molecules form intimate blends within this range.190 Often, it is more likely that PCBM would form phase-separated clusters at higher concentrations. Clustering results in reduction of the interfacial area between PCBM and semiconductor as compared to the intimate mixture of the same PCBM loading, leading to a reduction of exciton quenching efficiency. As a result, phase-separated blends with PCBM clusters would yield a lower diffusion coefficient as the PCBM concentration is increased.
Exciton–exciton annihilation
The exciton diffusion coefficient can be estimated by measuring the efficiency of the exciton–exciton annihilation.110,133,162,163,165,166,168,201–208 The exciton diffusion coefficient is calculated from γ, given eqn (13), which can be measured experimentally by modeling the PL decays measured at various excitation intensities of the incident light. Only one sample is needed for the measurements. However, the theoretical considerations are complex and there are two unknown parameters that are needed for the modeling, namely the annihilation radius Ra and initial exciton density n0. It is quite difficult to set an independent experiment to measure these parameters and they are typically assumed to have a certain value. Only materials with exceptional photochemical stability can be investigated using this method because intense laser light is required to create high enough exciton density for the exciton–exciton annihilation to occur.
Microwave conductivity
An interesting method to measure exciton diffusion lengths has been developed at Delft University of Technology.175,209–214 Exciton quenching in semiconductor-TiO2 bilayers has been estimated by observing enhancement in photoconductivity in the TiO2 layer due to electron transfer from the semiconductor layer. The change in photoconductivity is estimated by measuring the change of the intensity of reflected microwave radiation upon optical excitation of the semiconductor. The microwave conductivity in TiO2 is then modeled depending on the thickness of the organic layer. The important advantage of this method is that it is also sensitive for non-emissive excitons, such as triplets. However, this method has all the problems of the PL quenching methods in bilayers as discussed above and therefore it is also not ideal for systematic studies of exciton diffusion.
Electro-optical measurements
Exciton diffusion length can be estimated by modeling current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of a solar cell, of an OLED, or a similar device.55,63,176,177,180,184,187,215–224 The typical sample consists of at least one organic semiconductor layer and two electrodes. The theoretical model includes the electrical, optical, and exciton diffusion parts. It is a big challenge to describe the charge transport through a specific organic layer as well as to understand charge injection/extraction at the electrical contacts. The effect of metallic electrodes on the distribution of the excitation light – and generated excitons – within the device must be carefully calculated.169,225 Exciton quenching at metallic electrodes should be also included into the model. These photocurrent measurements are the most difficult way to extract the exciton diffusion length. It is reasonable to apply this method to a semiconductor that does not show efficient photoluminescence.
4. Controlling singlet exciton diffusion length
In order to improve the device performance of organic solar cells and OLEDs, there have been multiple attempts to understand what factors limit exciton diffusion length. The common strategies to enhance singlet exciton diffusion include controlling the degree of crystallinity and optimizing Förster energy transfer. In addition, it has been also pointed out that elimination of ubiquitous exciton quenching defects may also lead to improvement of the diffusion length.73,195,226,227 In this section, we summarize recent findings in this area of research.
Theoretical limit of exciton diffusion length
Yost et al. presented an interesting theoretical study, in which singlet and triplet diffusion processes were considered by purely ab inito means.228 The authors examined fundamental limits of increasing exciton diffusion length and used tetracene as an example. They argue that for singlets it is difficult to increase the diffusion coefficient without decreasing the exciton lifetime. The only physical parameter that varies from material to material and influences the diffusion length is the transition dipole. The diffusion coefficient is increasing with transition dipole, while the radiative decay time is decreasing. Therefore, the singlet exciton diffusion length has its theoretical maximum of ∼100 nm for tetracene. For triplets, diffusion coefficient and lifetime can be varied independently, thus there is no fundamental limit in increasing the diffusion length. Triplet excitons have long lifetime due to spin-forbidden transition to the ground state, while diffusion coefficient is mainly determined by the wavefunction overlap of the neighboring molecules.
Optimizing exciton diffusion
Optimization of exciton diffusion length relies on the ability to fine tune parameters in the expression (4). A nice illustration of reduction of the non-radiative decay rate knr was presented by Menke et al.64,229 Exciton diffusion length has been increased from 10.7 to 15.3 nm in subphthalocyanine derivative by blending the subphthalocyanine within a high band gap matrix 1,4-phenylenebis(triphenylsilane) (UGH2) (see Fig. 10). Intermolecular interactions between subphthalocyanine molecules are suppressed in such blends resulting in reduction of self-quenching. The performance of the bi-layer solar cell is increased by 30% when utilizing this approach. Raisys et al. made systematic chemical modifications to a series of nine triphenylamine (TPA)-cored derivatives by incorporation of phenylethenyl side-arms. Exciton diffusion length in these compounds shows improvement from 1 to 7 nm upon increase of the number of side-arms. Such an increase is attributed to the increase of the spectral overlap J by means of reduction of the Stokes-shift and enhancement of the extinction coefficient in compounds containing a larger number of the side-arms.

In many cases materials with higher degree of order or crystallinity show higher singlet diffusion length. Lunt et al. used spectrally resolved PL quenching to measure singlet exciton diffusion in 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA).160Fig. 11b shows that exciton diffusion length is increased from 6 to 20 nm as the average diameter of crystalline domains is enhanced from 100 to 400 nm. Such an increase is attributed to the reduction of non-radiative losses at grain boundaries, which is also reflected in correlation of PL quantum yield and exciton diffusion length (see Fig. 11a). Yang et al. studied exciton diffusion in Zn-phthalocyanine films with different degree of crystallinity and observed an increase of LD from 9 to 16 nm.230 Lin at al. systematically measured the exciton diffusion length in three small molecule organic semiconductors based on diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) with incremental chemical modifications and found that material with highest degree of crystallinity showed an exciton diffusion length of 13 nm, while the least crystalline compound resulted in LD of 9 nm.121 Rim et al. showed that the exciton diffusion length is longer in more ordered trans-isomer (5 nm) as compared to the disordered cis-isomer (2.6 nm) in a perylene derivative.184 Sim et al. measured the exciton diffusion length in poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) using a method of spectrally-resolved PL quenching in bi-layers as a function of thermal annealing.231 They found that the exciton diffusion length is increased from 3.3 to 7 nm with increasing the annealing temperature, which leads to enhancement of the crystalline ordering. The factors, which directly influenced the exciton diffusion length include improvement of the spectral overlap J between emission and absorption of more ordered film, as well as reduction of energetic disorder resulting in more efficient exciton diffusion. Exciton diffusion length in a squaraine derivative has been increased from 1.6 to 5 nm upon thermal annealing.188 Exciton diffusion lengths above 20 nm have been only reported in single crystals or in polycrystalline films with large grains due to low degree of disorder yielding short interchromophore distances deq at the quasi-equilibrium level, see eqn (9) and Fig. 7b.85,160,179,203,216,223,232,233

Dashed lines represent the single-crystalline limit. (Reprinted with permission from ref. 160. Copyright 2010 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.) 
On the other hand, thermal annealing can also lead to steep reduction of exciton diffusion length. It has been shown that despite enhanced crystalline ordering, the exciton diffusion length was reduced from 9 to 3 nm in a DPP derivative upon heating at 80 °C for 10 minutes.234 Such a reduction in diffusion length is related to the quenching at grain boundaries that appear in the film upon amorphous-polycrystalline transition. Similar effect has been observed in poly[3,4-dihexyl thiophene-2,2′:5,6′-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene] (PDHBDT) by Ko et al.235 In PDHBDT exciton diffusion lengths decreased upon thermal annealing from 12.5 to 6 nm. And finally is has been also shown that processing organic semiconductors with high boiling point additive can result in reduction of exciton diffusion length despite apparent increase in the degree of crystallinity.65 Films that were processed with the additive have additional excitonic traps, which are responsible for reduction of the diffusion length.
An interesting approach to modulation of exciton diffusion length was presented by Ortiz et al.236 They showed that the addition of heavy atom substituent (iodine) to a porphyrin molecule yields in systematic reduction of exciton diffusion length from 15 to 4 nm. This effect is linked to enhanced intersystem crossing of singlet excitons to triplet manifold resulting in reduction of singlet lifetime and thus LD.
Trap-limited exciton transport
In solid films of organic semiconductors, excitons diffuse and may encounter impurities and morphological and chemical defects resulting in exciton quenching. These trap states may limit LD if the average distance between traps becomes similar to L0, the exciton diffusion length of a defect-free material. The impact of trap-limited quenching on LD can be quantified by the lifetime ratio τf/τ0 that enters eqn (7): (17) The intrinsic exciton lifetime τ0 is usually estimated from PL measurement in a dilute solution. However, this approach of determining τ0 may be invalid in case of strong intermolecular interactions. The density of excitonic traps c0 can be estimated using Stern–Volmer analysis:195 (18) Using the obtained expression and a Monte-Carlo simulation we showed that exciton diffusion length is indeed limited by the defect states in a series of common amorphous organic semiconductors195 and that the density of exciton traps is within the range of 1017–1018 cm−3 in eleven studied materials. The average distance between these traps then determines the exciton diffusion length: resulting in values of LD in the range of 5–10 nm (see Table 3).
Interestingly, the obtained density of excitonic traps is nearly equal to the density of electron traps that are observed in common organic semiconductors.227 Since exciton quenching and electron trapping are essentially the same process of electron transfer to the trap site, it is suggested that these are the same species. Liang et al. made an observation that leads to a similar conclusion by studding n-type doping of P3HT with cobaltocene.226 They saw a simultaneous increase in conductivity and PL lifetime upon increase of dopant loading. The authors related this effect to the filling the trap states with the help of electron donating ability of cobaltocene. The maximum of conductivity and PL lifetime was achieved at dopant concentration of 1.2 × 1018 cm−3 that corresponds to the density of exciton quenchers that was found by our work.
Athanasopoulos et al. presented a theoretical prediction of trap-limited exciton transport.73 They developed a comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation of exciton diffusion with detailed exciton hopping model, in which transfer rates were calculated for 50 nearest neighbors during each hop. As an example experimental data of a polyfluorene derivative have been used. Most of the input parameters were deduced from absorption and emission spectra. The resulting LD of ∼60 nm is similar to the values typically obtained from single crystals. However, inclusion of excitonic traps enabled them to explain the smaller measured value of ∼10 nm.
5. Triplet exciton diffusion
Triplet excitons are expected to have longer diffusion length than singlets due to their much longer lifetime, see eqn (3) and Table 4. However, values as short as 10–20 nm have been reported recently, similar to the singlet exciton diffusion length.114,237–243 On the other hand, there are plenty of publications with triplet diffusion length of more than 100 nm.5,9,44,187,244–246 Moreover, different values in the range of 10–250 nm have been published for the same materials.53,143,238,239,244 Such a controversy probably stems from the use of different methods to measure triplet exciton diffusion. Most available techniques are complex and it is hard to control the relevant processes that influence the exciton diffusion length such as triplet–triplet annihilation. Simple PL quenching techniques can only be applied to phosphorescent materials.114,247 Here we summarize notable methods used to measure the triplet exciton diffusion length (see Table 2).

Direct observation delayed luminescence spread
Perhaps one of the oldest methods of measuring triplet exciton diffusion is based on detection of the spatial spread of delayed fluorescence in single crystals.5,131,151,248,249 The main idea of this method is based on localization of triplet generation region to a small area with linear dimensions smaller or similar to the diffusion length. Triplet excitons diffuse outside from the generation area and undergo triplet–triplet annihilation. The resulting delayed fluorescence is then detected as a function of time and/or intensity of generation. Then the data is fitted to the diffusion equation with the annihilation term being dependent on in diffusion length. In this way exciton diffusion lengths of ∼1–10 μm were extracted in antracene,82,248 tetracene,246 and rubrene5 crystals. This method can be only applied for systems with triplet diffusion length in the order of a micrometer.
Measurements in LED configuration
A specially designed multilayer LED can be used to measure triplet exciton diffusion.44,53,140,237–239,250–252 In this structure, the charge recombination region is spatially confined within a thin interfacial region between electron and hole transporting layers. A phosphorescent dopant is deployed in one of the transporting layers at certain distance L from the exciton generation region. The materials are selected such that triplet energy transfer from the host semiconductor to the dopant is favorable. Then the intensity of phosphorescent emission of the dopant molecules is correlated to the triplet density of the host material in the vicinity of the dopant layer, i.e. at distance L from the charge recombination region. The profile of triplet exciton density within the semiconductor layer is measured by recording the dependence of phosphorescence intensity of the dopant molecules versus distance L. This profile is theoretically modeled to extract the exciton diffusion length.
The emission intensity of the phosphorescent dopant is strongly affected by the outcoupling efficiency that must be carefully calculated and included into the model. In a working LED, there is a significant amount of polarons that are efficient quenchers of triplet excitons. However, polaron-triplet interactions have been always neglected in the LED-based methods.253 The thickness and position of the recombination region depends on the total electrical current that flows through the device. These effects set certain limits on the value of the working current. It is difficult to evaluate the effect of triplet–triplet annihilation in this method. Due to many complications and uncertainties in the LED methods, it is not surprising that very different values of the triplet diffusion length have been extracted in the same materials.
Photocurrent and microwave conductivity
Similar to singles, triplet exciton diffusion length can be also measured in using previously described methods such as the photocurrent modeling6,217,240,241,244,254–257 and the microwave conductivity measurements.209,242 In these methods it is important to distinguish contributions of triplet vs. singlet excitons to photocurrent or microwave conductivity leading to an additional complication. Usually the effect of triplet–triplet annihilation is not taken into account when applying these methods. Values of triplet exciton diffusion lengths of 10–250 nm have been reported in several materials.
Remote phosphorescent sensing
Triplet exciton diffusion can be directly probed in a bilayer structure comprising a pure organic semiconductor layer and a layer that is heavily doped with phosphorescent molecules.44,143 Triplet excitons are created by intersystem crossing in the semiconductor, followed by their diffusion toward the doped layer, where their energy is transferred to the dopants and detected as phosphorescent emission. The phosphorescence decay and delayed fluorescence are then modeled using the diffusion equation, leading to the exciton diffusion length. The model used requires four fitting parameters including the exciton diffusion length, triplet–triplet annihilation rate, transfer rate from host material to the phosphorescent dopant and the initial triplet density. In 4,4′-bis(N-carbazolyl)biphenyl (CBP) the resulting exciton diffusion length was estimated to be 25 nm when triplet–triplet annihilation is efficient and 140 nm when the annihilation is absent.143 Disadvantages of this method are the large number of fitting parameters and the complex theoretical model.
Triplet diffusion length can be measured directly in a three-layer structures consisting of a triplet injecting layer, an organic semiconductor, and a triplet detecting layer.258 The triplet injector is a phosphorescent material with triplet energy higher than the triplet of semiconductor. Thus optically excited triplet excitons are transferred from the injector layer to the organic semiconductor. The injected triples then diffuse through the thickness L of organic semiconductors and can be detected by the phosphorescent triplet detector. In order to achieve efficient triplet detection, detector must have its triplet energy lower than semiconductor's triplet. By varying the thickness L, it is possible to accurately measure triplet diffusion length. In this way triplet exciton diffusion length of 90 nm was extracted in N,N′-di-[(1-naphthyl)-N,N′-diphenyl]-(1,1′-biphenyl)-4,4′-diamine (NPD).
Phosphorescent quenching
The fluorescence quenching methods of measuring exciton diffusion length can be also applied for materials that show efficient radiative decay of triplet excitons (phosphorescence).114,247,254 Typically these materials show short triplet diffusion length similar to that of singlets. For instance, Hsu et al. studied triplet exciton diffusion in a Pt-coordinated polymer that was blended with small amounts of fullerenes.200 Exciton diffusion length of 22 nm is extracted by modeling phosphorescence decays of these blends with Stern–Volmer equation. It is important to note, that triplet excitons can be also transported via Förster energy transfer in some metal-coordinated compounds that show high phosphorescence yields.33–38
Modeling of absorption transients
Transient absorption can be used to study in detail the dynamics of excited states in organic semiconductors.9,206,245,259–261 Absorption spectrum of conjugated molecules in a triplet excited state usually differs from the ground state absorption. Then by tracking the time evolution of this difference in absorption, it is possible to extract triplet diffusion parameters. Using this approach Tamai et al. measured triplet diffusion length in polyfluorene based polymers yielding LD of 40–50 nm. They modeled time evolution of triplet population under conditions of triplet–triplet annihilation.259 Poletayev et al. estimated triplet diffusion length of 40–80 nm in thin films and 300–800 nm in crystals of pentacene.9 Extremely long triplet diffusion length of 2–4 μm has been reported in a ladder-type conjugated polymer using detection of triplet excitons with photoinduced absorption in polymer-fullerene blends.245
6. Conclusions and outlook
Exciton diffusion in organic semiconductors has been studied in the past few decades. A number of experimental techniques have been established to measure the diffusion length resulting in over a hundred values of LD published to date. Organic crystals show a large spread of LD ranging from 10 to 100 nanometers for singlets and up to several micrometers for triplet excitons. The majority of amorphous materials show singlet exciton diffusion length of 5–10 nm despite large variability in chemical structure. It has been suggested that singlet exciton diffusion length is limited by excitonic traps, which are present in every solution-processed organic semiconductor. However, the nature of these traps still has to be identified in order to reduce or eliminate their impact on exciton diffusion.
The inherent disorder present in organic semiconductors to large extend determines physical processes related to exciton diffusion. At room temperature exciton diffusion is thermally activated, while below ∼150 K the diffusion has dispersive character and is determined by the downhill migration of excitons within the inhomogeneously broadened excitonic density of states.
Controlling exciton diffusion length remains an interesting topic of research. Only a handful of reports showed examples of enhancement of exciton diffusion length by engineering the Förster energy transfer rate or by tweaking the chemical structure of the organic semiconductor. For light harvesting applications it is interesting to design unidirectional exciton transport by means of self-assembly.
Triplet exciton diffusion has recently reclaimed spotlight in a view of development of singlet fission solar cells. In these devices, photoinduced singlet excitons undergo a fission process resulting in two triplets. In this way it is possible to create two pairs of charges for each absorbed photon with a potential of external quantum efficiency of 200%. If successful, fission solar cells may overcome the Shockley–Queisser limit of the maximum solar cell efficiency. Triplet exciton diffusion is an important process for charge generation in the fission solar cells and thus has to be studied in more detail. Moreover, singlet fission is competing with a reverse process of triplet–triplet annihilation, also known as triplet fusion. It is desirable to find ways of disabling the triplet–triplet annihilation, which is diffusion limited process.
One of the bottlenecks for the realization of electrically pumped lasers using organic semiconductors is a roll-off efficiency when driving an OLED with large current. This parasitic effect is associated with exciton quenching when interacting with injected charges. Exciton-polaron annihilation is an interesting phenomenon, which has not yet been studied in detail. Physical parameters that govern such annihilation such as annihilation cross-section have to be measured experimentally. In this respect is it is interesting to study exciton diffusion in doped organic semiconductors.
Finally there are new emerging types of materials, in which exciton diffusion has not yet been studied. These materials include TADF compounds and conjugated polyelectrolytes. In addition, more data is needed on n-type organic semiconductors, as most of the measurements of exciton diffusion length were performed on p-type materials. To achieve this, one needs to find new efficient exciton quenchers for n-type organic semiconductors.

Broader context
Organic semiconductors provide emerging technology for consumer electronics. Organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) have already entered the market as they offer more vibrant colors when compared to conventional liquid crystalline screens. Organic photovoltaics (OPV) promise flexible and inexpensive solar cells, which will find niche applications for smart power generation such as clothing, portable cellphone charges, and power generating windows. These devices convert electricity to light and light to electrical current using excited states called excitons. Dynamics of excitons determine key device performance characteristics such as power conversion efficiency of solar cells and brightness of OLEDs. This review summarizes recent experimental findings and basic concepts relevant to exciton diffusion in organic semiconductors.


 	Fig. 1  (a) A conjugated backbone with overlapping pz orbitals that point out of the molecular plane. (b) Highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO and LUMO). Arrows denote two electrons with different spins.	 

 	Fig. 2  The Jablonski diagram of electronic transitions in organic semiconductors. The energies of singlet (S0 and S1) and triplet (T1 and Tn) states are scaled vertically. Absorption (1), fluorescence (2), intersystem crossing (4), phosphorescence (6), nonradiative transitions (3 and 5) and photoinduced absorption (7) are presented as arrows.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Förster energy transfer. (b) Dexter energy transfer enables diffusion of triplet excitons. The horizontal lines are HOMO and LUMO energy levels of donor (D) and acceptor (A) molecules; the asterisk denotes excited state. The dashed arrows represent simultaneous rearrangement of the electronic configuration. (c) Electron transfer from an excited donor molecule (D*) to a neutral acceptor (A).	 

 	Fig. 4  Exciton quenching due to charge transfer at the semiconductor (donor) – fullerene (acceptor) interface. Electrons and holes are denoted as (e) and (h). Conjugated segments are schematically depicted as pairs of HOMO–LUMO levels.

 	Fig. 5  Exciton diffusion process at low and room temperatures. The excitonic Gaussian density of states is represented by the distribution of the excitonic energies. The exciton–phonon coupling determines the position of the energy level of the most populated states. (a) The downhill migration fully determines the exciton diffusion process at low temperatures. (b) At room temperature, the thermally activated hopping also contributes to the exciton diffusion length. (Replotted with permission from ref. 88. Copyright 2008 American Chemical Society.)

Fluorescence quenching in bi-layers	★ ∼10 bi-layer films with quenching layer and varying thickness of organic semiconductor; ∼10 pristine films of different thickness	★★ PL decay time or ★ PL intensity; accurate film thickness measurement; optical constants	★★★ An analytical model often can be applied	★ Amorphous smooth films. (!) Sharp and highly quenching interface is required


Fluorescence volume quenching	★★★ Only two films are required	★★★ PL decay time or ★ PL intensity; film density	★★★ Stern–Volmer analysis for monoexponential decays, or free Monte Carlo Simulation for multi-exponential PL decays	★★ Moderately polycrystalline or amorphous films


Exciton–exciton annihilation	★★★ Only one pristine film is required	★★ PL decay time under different excitation intensities, but annihilation cross-section is hard to measure	★★★ Analytical model is available	★★ Amorphous, polycrystalline, or crystalline materials with exceptional photo-stability


Microwave Conductivity	★ ∼5–10 bi-layer films with semiconductive quenching layer (TiO2) and varying thickness of organic semiconductor	★ Custom combination of optical and microwave measurements	★★★ An analytical model can be applied	★★ Amorphous materials with non-emissive excitons


Electro-optical measurements	★ A full device has to be prepared such as solar cell or LED	★★ Measurement of device parameters such as external quantum efficiency	★ Modeling usually has multiple fitting parameters including charge transport	★★ Amorphous or polycrystalline materials with non-emissive excitons; n-type materials

Direct observation delayed luminescence spread	★★ Large homogeneous sample or single crystal	★★ microscope imaging or usage of secondary structures	★★★ An analytical model is available	★ Single crystals with large triplet diffusion length


Measurement in LED configuration	★ Multiple working multilayer OLED devices	★★ PL intensity vs. thickness of active layer	★ Modeling is complex with multiple fitting parameters	★ Amorphous smooth materials with good charge transport properties


Photocurrent and microwave conductivity	★ Bi-layers, which are included in a working solar or used for microwave conductivity	★ Measure device parameters such as external quantum efficiency or use custom combination of optics and microwaves. Hard to distinguish between singlet and triplet excitons	★★ Modeling is sophisticated, but an analytical model sometimes can be used	★★ Amorphous smooth materials, single crystals


Remote phosphorescent sensing	★★ ∼10 multilayer films, typically vacuum deposited	★★ PL intensity or PL lifetime	★★ Depending on sample structure modeling can be very simple or quite complex	★★ Amorphous materials
