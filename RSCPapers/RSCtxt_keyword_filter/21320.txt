    , Accepted 29th July 2019First published on 31st July 2019AbstractConstructing fused perylene diimide (PDI) dimers with heteroaromatic bridges toward non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) has become an efficient strategy to achieve high performance organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, FDTC-PDI containing fully fused two PDIs with one central unit of angular-shaped S,N-heteroacene was developed and explored as a novel NFA for OSCs. The molecular geometry, optical spectra, energy levels, charge carrier mobilities and the morphology discrepancies as well as the corresponding photovoltaic performance of FDTC-PDI and its non-fused precursor, DTC-PDI, were investigated and compared. Theoretical calculations reveal that FDTC-PDI has a better planar molecular conformation and more effective conjugated length than DTC-PDI. As a consequence, by blending FDTC-PDI with PTB7-Th as the electron acceptor and the electron donor material, respectively, the inverted solar cells exhibited an encouraging PCE of 4.78% along with a Jsc of 11.72 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.96 V and a FF of 42.5%, which were superior to those of its counterpart DTC-PDI (2.68%). These results are associated with the higher molar extinction coefficient, more balanced carrier mobility and better morphology of FDTC-PDI as well as its high-lying LUMO energy level. Note that no solvent additive was used in the process of device optimizations, thus simplifying the device fabrication, and improving the stability and reproducibility of the photovoltaic devices. We also prospect much broader application of the angular-shaped S,N-heteroacene with rigidity and planarity as a promising building block for fully fused electron acceptors for accomplishing the challenges in organic solar cells.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ OSCs) as alternative clean photovoltaic devices have drawn global attention due to their low cost, light weight, and capability of fabricating flexible devices.1–6 Benefiting from their high electron mobility, isotropic electron transporting ability and favorable miscibility with donor materials, fullerene derivatives as acceptor materials have played a dominant role in the field of BHJ OSCs for a long period of time.7,8 Nevertheless, fullerene derivatives suffer from several evident drawbacks, such as the expensive production cost, the poor solubility, the weak light absorption in the visible to near-infrared region and the difficult tunability of energy levels, which somehow have become the bottlenecks in the development of materials for further advancing OSCs.9–11 The emergence of small molecule acceptors (SMAs) with excellent properties could overcome the shortcomings of fullerene derivatives.10,11 It is reported that BHJ OSCs based on SMAs allow for exhibiting power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 16% for a single-junction device and 17% for tandem solar cells, surpassing the best performance fullerene-based OSCs.12–15
Tang enlightened the research of perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives as electron acceptors for OSC applications in 1986.16 From then on, tremendous efforts have been focused on developing PDI based non-fullerene acceptors by virtue of their outstanding chemical and physical properties.17,18 For instance, PDI based materials exhibit strong absorption bands (450–650 nm) in the visible region with the maximum molar extinction coefficient (εmax) (104 M−1 cm−1), promising electron mobilities (10−3–101 cm2 V−1 s−1), and highly tunable low-lying lowest-unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO, about −4.0 eV).19–21 However, their high planarity and strong intermolecular stacking tendency could induce an excessive aggregation, resulting in severe phase separation in BHJ films and thereby limiting the photovoltaic performance of solar cells.22–25 Generally, to alleviate this aggregation, one common strategy is constructing twisted PDI dimers (or trimers) through connecting the α, β positions or the N-position,26–30 and linking PDI units with different functional groups such as triphenylamine,31,32 tetraphenyl ethylene,33 triptycene,34 bifluorenylidene35 and spirofluorene.36,37 Although BHJ OSCs based on these twisted PDI derivatives as the electron acceptors have realized high PCEs they still lagged behind fullerene-based analogues. Recently, it has been shown that the fused PDI structure with rigidity and non-planar molecular geometry is effective in improving the performance of PDI acceptor-based PSCs.38–42 Particularly, the fully fused PDI dimers (or trimers) containing heteroacenes as the ring-fused linkers can effectively alter their molecular skeleton and electronic properties.43–53 In the fully fused PDI structure, they possess good structural rigidity with an enhanced effective conjugation between PDI units but maintain the overall non-planar molecular geometry. Several examples of high-performance fullerene-free BHJ OSCs have been disclosed as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Alex and coworkers reported a series of fused PDI derivatives bridged by furan, thiophene, and selenophene units.47 Fused PDIs showed better planarity and an increased LUMO energy level as well as higher mobility compared with the non-fused PDI dimers. Among the three fused PDI derivatives, the fused one containing a thiophene motif showed a PCE of 5.69% due to a higher carrier mobility, and the PCE was further improved to 6.72% via the addition of 2% chloronaphthalene (CN) in the active layer, indicating that suitable twisting and a fused chemical structure are necessary to achieve high device performance. A fully fused small molecule acceptor of FITP was designed and synthesized by Chen's group, in which two PDI units were fused with an indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) core.48 By blending with PTB7-Th as the electron donor, the device performance was improved from 6.13% to 7.33% with a high Voc of 0.99 V after adding 2% CN as the solvent additive. It is worth noting that solvent additives play a crucial role in improving the photovoltaic performance of the fused PDI-based solar cells. However, solvent additives increase the complexity and the cost of device fabrication. More importantly, they also exert a dramatic impact on the reproducibility of the device as well as accelerate the photo-oxidative degradation, limiting the stability and practical applications of the solar cells.49,50 Chen's group also developed fully fused tri-PDI with three PDI moieties by fusing three PDI units with S-heteroacene benzotrithiophene (BTT) as the core moiety. The fully fused tri-PDI was demonstrated as a superior photovoltaic material, and its PCE was almost three times higher than that of the non-fused analogue.51 Very recently, star-shaped helical perylene diimide (FTPDI2) and seleno twisted benzodiperylenediimides (TBDPDI-Se) were independently exploited by Xia52 and Chen;53 their devices realized PCEs of around 8% without adding any solvent additives. According to the aforementioned achievements, fused PDI dimers comprising heteroacenes as the core units should be attractive as promising non-fullerene acceptors because of their coplanarity and rigidity. Therefore, it is of great significance to seek and develop various heteroacenes that could be advantageous in combination with PDI dimers.
Pentacyclic dithieno[2,3-b:7,6-b]carbazole (DTC) with two thiophene moieties fused to a carbazole core, as a kind of angular-shaped S,N-heteroacene, has been widely utilized as a building block in the exploitation of conjugated polymers for applications in OSCs and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) by virtue of its electron donating properties and a planar/rigid π-conjugated system.54–56 It is expected that the angular-shaped DTC unit could be used to construct novel PDI derivatives as small molecule acceptors, where the angular-shaped feature of DTC will benefit the target molecules with less tendency to induce aggregation. Recently, we have reported A–D–A type small molecules containing angular-shaped heteroarene units57 and PDI derivatives58 for fullerene-free solar cells. Inspired by these pioneering works, we report the design and synthesis of a fully fused small molecule acceptor FDTC-PDI (Fig. 1) via an intramolecular cyclization reaction, in which the central angular-shaped S,N-heteroacene was fused with two PDI units. The absorption, energy levels, mobility, morphology and photovoltaic properties were carefully characterized and investigated. Preliminary photovoltaic performance based on FDTC-PDI as the electron acceptor showed encouraging potential in the inverted solar cell devices.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes of the small molecules DTC-PDI and FDTC-PDI are depicted in Scheme 1. Compound 1 as the starting material was prepared according to the similar methods in our previous reports.59–61N-Alkylation of compound 1 resulted in the formation of compound 2 with a high yield of 96%, which was reacted with KI/KIO3 in acetic acid as the solvent to obtain compound 3. In the presence of Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 and CuI as catalysts, compound 4 was successfully synthesized by the Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction with a good reaction yield of 68%. Subsequently, DTC as the important intermediate was obtained by the intramolecular cyclization reaction with Na2S in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) at 190 °C. Thereafter, the stannylation reaction at −78 °C was performed through introducing two tri-n-butyltin substituents on DTC to afford DTC-Sn in almost quantitative yield. After performing the Stille cross-coupling reaction using Pd2(dba)3 as the catalyst and P(o-tol)3 as the ligand in toluene at 100 °C for 24 h, DTC-Sn was readily reacted with PDI-Br to give the non-fused DTC-PDI in a yield of 81%.62 Finally, the non-fused DTC-PDI was treated with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyanobenzoquinone (DDQ) in dry dichloromethane at 0 °C and an intramolecular cyclization reaction occurred between the PDI units at their bay-positions and the central DTC unit, producing the fully fused FDTC-PDI as a black solid in 92% yield.63 The chemical structures of the target molecules DTC-PDI and FDTC-PDI were validated by 1H NMR (Fig. S4–S11, ESI†) and MALDI-TOF MS (Fig. S12 and S13, ESI†) measurements. The resultant small molecules flanked by alkyl side chains on the PDI and DTC building block possess excellent solubility in common organic solvents. Their thermal stability was analysed by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) under an N2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†) and Table 1, the onset decomposition temperatures (Td) corresponding to 5% weight loss were determined to be ∼395 °C for both DTC-PDI and FDTC-PDI, demonstrating their excellent thermal stability.

Optical and electrochemical properties

Fig. 2a and b show the absorption spectra of DTC-PDI and FDTC-PDI, respectively, where the spectra were measured in dilute chloroform solution (∼10−6 M) and the thin films prepared by spin-coating the dichlorobenzene solutions on quartz. The corresponding photophysical data including the maximum absorption peak (λmax), the absorption edge (λedge), the molar absorption coefficient (ε) and the optical band gap (Eoptg) are summarized in Table 1. The UV-vis spectra of FDTC-PDI and DTC-PDI solutions show multiple absorption peaks throughout the wavelength range of 300–650 nm, which are similar to their corresponding solid-state UV-vis absorption spectra. Interestingly, no obvious shift for spectra in solution states and in film states was observed, indicating that weak aggregation existed in the solid state. This may be associated with the angular-shaped conformations of the DTC motif in the two compounds. In the solution, the maximum molar extinction coefficients in the long wavelength region were found to be 8.2 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 512 nm for FDTC-PDI and 6.3 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 526 nm for DTC-PDI; especially for the short wavelength region, the maximum molar extinction coefficients were 1.9 × 106 M−1 cm−1 at 377 nm for FDTC-PDI and 0.8 × 106 M−1 cm−1 at 316 nm for DTC-PDI, respectively. Overall, FDTC-PDI with the ring fusion feature exhibits higher molar extinction coefficients in contrast to the unfused DTC-PDI. Besides, as shown in Fig. 2b, the absorption spectra of FDTC-PDI as the electron acceptor have better complementation with that of PTB7-Th between 300 and 800 nm, showing good potential in achieving high photon-current density as well as photovoltaic performance of the fullerene-free solar cells. As calculated from their absorption onsets of 730 nm and 705 nm, the optical bandgaps (Eoptg) were determined to be 1.69 eV for DTC-PDI and 1.76 eV for FDTC-PDI, respectively.

The electrochemical properties of DTC-PDI and FDTC-PDI were examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) with a ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) reference as an external standard. All CV data are shown in Fig. 2c and Table 1. From the reductive and oxidative onset potentials, the HOMO and LUMO of DTC-PDI were estimated to be −5.39 and −3.88 eV, whereas those of FDTC-PDI were −5.44 and −3.70 eV, respectively. The ring-fusion between DTC and PDIs increases the intramolecular electronic coupling, which results in an upshifted LUMO and a blue-shifted absorption43,44,47,51 for FDTC-PDI as shown in Fig. 2a and b. The DFT calculation shown in Fig. 3 indicates that the HOMO of FDTC-PDI extends to PDI segments and results in a deeper HOMO energy level than that of DTC-PDI. Thus, it results in a larger bandgap of 1.74 eV for FDTC-PDI than that of 1.51 eV for DTC-PDI. As depicted in the energy diagram in Fig. 2d, the energy offsets of the HOMO energy levels between PTB7-Th and DTC-PDI (0.27 eV) or FDTC-PDI (0.32 eV) are enough for the effective exciton dissociation to overcome the binding energy.64 The fully fused FDTC-PDI exhibits a similar HOMO energy level but a higher-lying LUMO energy level compared with its precursor DTC-PDI. Considering that the Voc is directly related to the offset of the donor's HOMO energy level and the acceptor's LUMO energy level, high Voc should be expected for the solar cells based on fused FDTC-PDI as the small molecule acceptor.65 The electrochemical band gap (Eecg) values of DTC-PDI (1.51 eV) and FDTC-PDI (1.74 eV) show a similar trend to their Eoptg values. Based on the above discussion, obviously, constructing the fully fused PDI dimers with angular-shaped S,N-heteroaromatic bridges can effectively tune the energy levels and bandgaps of these PDI derivatives.

Theoretical calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed by Gaussian 09 at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level to evaluate the effects of ring fusion on the molecular geometries of DTC-PDI and FDTC-PDI. The long-branched alkyl chains attached to N atoms were all replaced by methyl groups to simplify the calculation. As shown in Fig. 3, the dihedral angle between PDI and DTC subunits decreased from 63° for DTC-PDI to ∼10° for the fused FDTC-PDI. The smaller dihedral angle indicates that the more planar and extended conjugation structure is manifested in FDTC-PDI, inducing a higher electron mobility and better electron accepting ability. In addition, the molecular long axes of two PDI subunits in DTC-PDI and FDTC-PDI are not parallel to each other due to the non-linear feature of the DTC unit, which will impart a significant influence in their condensed states. This explained that the fused and semi-coplanar FDTC-PDI showed very less absorption shift in Fig. 2a and b. It should be noted that the distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals of DTC-PDI and FDTC-PDI is significantly different. For DTC-PDI, the HOMO and LUMO localize separately on the core group and the two PDI units, respectively, because of the highly twisted geometry and less effective conjugation. With respect to FDTC-PDI, the HOMO mainly focuses on the core and partial PDI units, and the LUMO mainly localizes along the two PDI units and partially extends to the core group. The more delocalized wave function of FDTC-PDI with significant overlapping may promote the exciton separation and electron transport, thus improving Jsc in BHJ OSCs. DFT calculations predict the HOMO/LUMO of DTC-PDI and FPDI-PDI to be −3.45/−5.37 and −3.25/−5.65, respectively. The trend in the variation of the energy levels is in good accordance with those obtained from the absorption and CV measurements, although differentiation between calculation and experimental results exists. These calculated results suggest that the ring fusion via intramolecular cyclization can not only enhance the planar conformation but also affect the distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals as well as elevate the LUMO of the resulting small molecules. The non-centrally symmetric characteristics of FDTC-PDI arising from the non-linear DTC will benefit the effect in suppressing the phase separation of FDTC-PDI in blends with donor materials.
Photovoltaic properties and mobility
To explore the photovoltaic performance of FDTC-PDI and DTC-PDI, fullerene-free solar cells with FDTC-PDI or DTC-PDI as the NFA were fabricated using an inverted device structure of ITO/ZnO/polymer electron donor:NFA/MoO3/Ag due to their ease of manufacturing and environmental stability. The photovoltaic performance of the devices was measured under irradiation of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) simulated solar light. The chemical structures of the donor polymer and the energy level are shown in Fig. 1 and 2d. As shown in Fig. 2d, the energy levels of FDTC-PDI and DTC-PDI are well-matched with that of PTB7-Th, in conjunction with their complementary UV-vis absorption spectra, indicating that PTB7-Th is an appropriate electron donor for engineering the PDI-based solar cells. The photoactive layer was spin-coated from o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) solutions of the small electron acceptors and PTB7-Th (25 mg ml−1). Various means including D/A weight ratios (from 1:0.8 to 1:1.5) and annealing temperatures (80, 100 and 150 °C) were used to optimize the solar cells. The optimal D/A weight ratios were found to be 1:1.25 for PTB7-Th/DTC-PDI and 1:1.5 for PTB7-Th/FDTC-PDI, respectively. The optimal annealing condition was selected as 80 °C for 20 min. The detailed optimization conditions are shown in Tables S1 and S2 (ESI†), and Table 2 summarizes the optimal photovoltaic performance parameters including Voc, short circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and PCEs of the devices. Fig. 4a shows the typical current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the solar cells under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. The device exhibited a PCE of 2.38% for as-cast PTB7-Th/DTC-PDI and 4.33% for as-cast PTB7-Th/FDTC-PDI, respectively. In our previous study,57 we found that the optimal performance of a conventional solar cell could be achieved by thermal annealing of the blend films for the fullerene-free solar cells. Similarly, after simple thermal annealing of active layers at 80 °C for 20 minutes, the device based on PTB7-Th/DTC-PDI achieved an inferior PCE of 2.60% along with a Jsc of 7.41 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.90 V and a FF of 39.8%. With regard to PTB7-Th/FDTC-PDI, a Jsc of 11.72 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.96 V, a FF of 42.5% and a decent PCE of 4.78% were realized. For the two small electron acceptors, the difference in the efficiency mainly stems from the pronounced difference in Jsc, which is believed to be attributed to the stronger light-absorbing capability and more complementary absorption. As expected, the device based on fused FDTC-PDI exhibits a slightly higher Voc (∼0.95 V) than DTC-PDI (∼0.88 V) due to the upshifted LUMO energy level. Designing the fully fused PDI dimers could effectively improve Jsc, Voc, FF and thus the photovoltaic performance.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) plots for the optimized BHJ OSCs with PTB7-Th as the polymer electron donor and FDTC-PDI or DTC-PDI as the small electron acceptor are shown in Fig. 4b. The devices containing PTB7-Th/DTC-PDI (1:1.25, w/w) and PTB7-Th/FDTC-PDI (1:1.5, w/w) blend films exhibited a broad spectral response from 300 to 800 nm, corresponding to the UV-vis absorption in the solid films. It is clear that the absorption of PTB7-Th and FDTC-PDI or DTC-PDI has significant contributions to the photocurrent. Specifically, the photon responses between 300 and 600 nm are mainly contributed by the small electron acceptor FDTC-PDI or DTC-PDI, whereas PTB7-Th plays a dominant role in the photon responses from 600 to 800 nm. It is worth noting that the FDTC-PDI-based solar cell shows a strong and broad photocurrent response from 300 to 800 nm, and the maximum value exceeds 70%, indicating effective photon harvesting and charge collection, which could partly explain a higher Jsc and PCE. By contrast, the EQE profile of the device with DTC-PDI as the electron acceptor exhibits relatively weaker photo responses and its maximum EQE value is only 37%, leading to an inferior Jsc and PCE. The calculated Jsc values integrated from the EQE spectrum for DTC-PDI and FDTC-PDI-based devices are 6.94 and 11.26 mA cm−2, respectively, which coincide well with Jsc obtained from the measurements (Fig. 4).
Tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to investigate the surface morphologies of the blend films. As shown in Fig. 5, the DTC-PDI and FDTC-PDI based as-cast blend films showed the root-mean square (RMS) values of 2.61 nm and 1.35 nm, respectively. After the thermal annealing treatment, the RMS values decreased to 1.52 nm and 1.16 nm. The FDTC-PDI/PTB7-Th blend film showed much smaller roughness and suitable aggregation, indicating the good miscibility of the donor and acceptor, which is beneficial for forming bicontinuous interpenetrating networks for the charge transport.

To investigate the charge transport properties of the solar cells with FDTC-PDI or DTC-PDI as the electron acceptor, the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method using the Mott–Gurney equation was employed to measure the charge carrier mobilities with the device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag for the hole mobility (μh) and ITO/ZnO/active layer/LiF/Al for the hole mobility (μe), respectively. Fig. S2 (ESI†) displays the typical J–V curves of the hole-only and electron-only devices and the values of hole and electron mobilities are summarized in Table 2. With the thermal annealing treatment, the μh and μe were calculated to be 6.49 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1 and 1.66 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1 for the PTB7-Th/FDTC-PDI blend films, whereas the μh and μe values were 1.28 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1 and 2.19 × 10−5 cm−2 V−1 s−1 for PTB7-Th/DTC-PDI, respectively. Thus, the charge carrier mobilities of FDTC-PDI were greater than those of DTC-PDI, presumably attributed to molecular packing as a result of better planarity and the more effective conjugated length. In addition, the μh/μe values are 5.84 for PTB7-Th/DTC-PDI and 3.91 for PTB7-Th/FDTC-PDI, respectively. The higher and more balanced charge carrier mobilities of PTB7-Th/FDTC-PDI contribute to the enhanced Jsc and FF as well as the photovoltaic performance in the corresponding device, which is in accordance with the measured photovoltaic performance.
Conclusions
In conclusion, a novel fully fused perylene diimide-based small molecule acceptor, FDTC-PDI, was designed and synthesized, and its device performance in BHJ OSCs was studied and compared to its non-fused precursor DTC-PDI. The two small molecules possess good solubility and thermal stability. Due to the higher delocalization of the LUMO and its more planar structure, FDTC-PDI demonstrates better electron transport properties than DTC-PDI. PTB7-Th was utilized as the p-type polymer to fabricate the inverted organic solar cell devices with two small molecule acceptors owing to the complementary spectra and matched energy levels. Benefiting from the above-mentioned advantages, FDTC-PDI shows superior photovoltaic performance to DTC-PDI in fullerene-free solar cells. In particular, for FDTC-PDI based solar cells, simultaneous enhancement in Jsc, Voc, and FF was demonstrated after ring fusion. As a preliminary consequence, the PCE of FDTC-PDI based solar cells increased drastically by 78% compared to that of DTC-PDI (2.68%) after the thermal annealing treatment, reaching 4.78%. We believe that higher performance OPV devices containing FDTC-PDI or its derivatives as the electron acceptors may be obtained through further delicate chemical structure design and device optimization in the near future.
