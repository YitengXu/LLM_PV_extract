1. Introduction
With the emergence of two-dimensional (2D) materials, there have been substantial activities to explore novel materials with unique mechanical, electronic, and optical properties.1–3 In particular, the creation of a large variety of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures free of lattice mismatching opens up an unprecedented opportunity for the development of novel electronic, optoelectronic, and spintronic devices with desirable functions and performance.4–6 For instance, vdW heterostructures consisting of two different types of 2D semiconductors for donors (n-type) and acceptors (p-type) have promising prospects in flexible and ultrathin photovoltaic devices. By choosing two different materials for the donor and acceptor, it is possible to separate charge carriers at the heterostructure interface. With regard to solar cells, other factors require consideration, for example, a bandgap of roughly 1.2–1.6 eV to absorb more sunlight7 and high carrier mobility to facilitate transport. Hence, the performance of the heterostructure critically depends on the choice of the donor and acceptor materials.8
Phosphorene is an interesting and promising 2D material that has been experimentally isolated by mechanical exfoliation from bulk black phosphorus.9 Phosphorene possesses fascinating properties such as a thickness-dependent bandgap, excellent carrier mobility, and ambipolar conduction characteristics.10,11 These properties, together with its unique structure, render phosphorene the ideal 2D material for solar cells. For example, solar cells based on BP/MoS2 have been designed with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) that is predicted to be as high as 16%,12 while the carrier mobility of MoS2 is relatively low.13 Thus, a solar cell composed with this BP heterostructure, high PCE, and excellent carrier mobility should be systematically explored.
Recently, phosphorene-like analogues such as GeS, GeSe, SnS, and SnSe have received considerable attention due to their puckered structure that is similar to phosphorene, as well as anisotropic characteristics.14 Moreover, they are environmentally friendly and earth abundant, and possess suitable bandgaps.15–17 It has been predicted that SnSe has unique electronic and optical properties suitable for flexible photovoltaics.16 In fact, few-layer SnSe has been experimentally prepared,18 and it has been predicted that the monolayer is thermodynamically stable and can be mechanically exfoliated from the bulk counterparts.19 It is reasonable to expect that the BP/SnSe vdW heterostructure has interesting photoelectronic properties that can be successfully applied to photovoltaic devices. However, although the BP/SnSe vdW heterostructure has been produced,20 a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and optical properties of BP/SnSe vdW heterostructure is still absent. There must be increased understanding of the photovoltaic properties of the BP/SnSe vdW heterostructure before they can be applied to solar cells.
In this work, the BP/SnSe vdW heterostructure was designed and its photoelectronic properties were systematically studied by first-principles calculations. The results show that the carriers in the BP/SnSe vdW heterostructure can be separated, and the carrier mobility, especially the electron mobility, is outstanding. Moreover, the heterostructure exhibits strong and broad light absorption from the visible to deep ultraviolet regions. The broad absorption coupled with a staggered gap results in a maximum PCE of 17.24% under 5% biaxial tensile strain, consequently rendering the BP/SnSe vdW heterostructure promising for use in high-performance photovoltaic devices.
2. Computational methods
2.1 DFT calculation
The density functional theory (DFT) calculation was carried out using the projector augmented wave (PAW)21 scheme with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) exchange correlation functional,22 as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).23,24 The electron wave function was expanded on a plane-wave basis set with a cutoff energy of 400 eV, and the Brillouin zone was sampled with a Γ-centered grid of 3 × 9 × 1. A vacuum layer thicker than 15 Å was added to eliminate spurious interactions between adjacent layers. In order to more precisely describe the effects of the van der Waals interactions, the optB88-vdW correction was employed to correct dispersion,25,26 and it has been demonstrated that it reliably describes phosphorene systems.10,27 The atomic positions were fully relaxed until the convergence criteria of energy and force were less than 10−5 eV and 10−2 eV Å−1. In order to more accurately derive the electronic band structure, the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional28,29 was implemented.
2.2 Absorption coefficient calculation
In the study of optical properties, the optical absorption coefficient α(ω) is based on the following formula: (1)where ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) denote the real and imaginary parts of the complex dielectric function, respectively. The imaginary part of the dielectric matrix is determined by summation of empty states: (2)where α and β refer to the x and y directions, and Ω denotes the volume of the unit cell. The indices c and v refer to the conduction and valence band states, respectively, and μck corresponds to the eigenstate with the wave vector k. The k-mesh of optical properties calculation was employed at 5 × 13 × 1 for the BP/SnSe vdW heterostructure.
2.3 Carrier mobility calculation
The carrier mobility in the 2D system is described by the following formula:30 (3)where e denotes the electron charge, ħ denotes the reduced Planck constant, kB denotes the Boltzmann constant, T denotes the temperature, m* denotes the carrier effective mass in the transport direction, md denotes the average effective mass determined by , and E1 denotes the deformation potential (DP) constant in the transport direction defined as E1 = ΔV/(Δl/l0). Here, ΔV denotes the energy change of the band edge induced by lattice compression or dilation of the heterostructure (calculated using a step of 0.5%), l0 denotes the lattice constant in the transport direction, and Δl denotes the deformation of l0. The elastic modulus C2D of longitudinal strain in the propagation directions (both x and y) of the longitudinal acoustic wave is derived according to (E − E0)/S0 = C(Δl/l0)2/2, where E denotes the total energy and S0 denotes the area of the 2D system in the equilibrium state. The temperature used for the mobility calculation is 300 K. The effective masses of electrons and holes are calculated by fitting the parabolic functions of the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM), respectively, as follows: (4)
2.4 PCE calculation
The PCE is calculated using Scharber's method,31 which can be expressed as following: (5)where Jsc, Voc, βFF, and Psolar are the short circuit current in the limit of 100% external quantum efficiency (EQE),32 maximum open circuit voltage, band-fill factor (βFF = 0.65), and incident solar flux (Psolar = 1000 W m−2). The integral term in the numerator is the short circuit current Jsc, Voc estimated by (Edg − ΔEc − 0.3), ΔEc is the conduction band offset (CBO), and Psolar is obtained by the integral  for the AM1.5 solar flux P(ħω) (in W m−2 eV−1).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Geometric structure
To study the geometric structure of the BP/SnSe vdW heterostructure, we first discuss the crystal structures of the isolated BP and SnSe monolayers, as shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b). For the monolayered BP, the optimized lattice parameters are: a = 4.60 Å and b = 3.31 Å. The SnSe monolayer shares a similar orthorhombic structure with BP, and the optimized lattice parameters are: a = 4.43 Å and b = 4.28 Å for the SnSe monolayer. The lattice constants are consistent with those shown in previous studies (see Table 1).10,33 In order to minimize the mismatch between the BP and SnSe monolayer, the supercell of the BP/SnSe vdW heterostructure is composed of 1 × 4 unit cells of BP and 1 × 3 unit cells of SnSe, as shown in Fig. 1(c) and (d). The lattice constants of the BP/SnSe vdW heterostructure are a = 4.60 Å and b = 13.25 Å, and the lattice mismatch values along the x- and y-directions are 1.67% and 3.14%, respectively.

To explore stacking of the BP and SnSe monolayer, three stacking patterns labeled AA, AB, and AC are considered, and the relaxed configurations are shown in Fig. S1 (see the ESI†). Our results show that AB stacking is energetically most favorable and is 50 meV and 80 meV less than those of AA and AC stackings, respectively. Hence, AB stacking was chosen in our subsequent study.
To evaluate the energetic stability of the BP/SnSe vdW heterostructure, the binding energy (Eb) was calculated according to the following formula: (6)where EBP/SnSe, EBP, and ESnSe represent the total energies of the BP/SnSe vdW heterostructure and BP and SnSe monolayer, respectively, and NP denotes the number of phosphorus atoms in the vdW heterostructure. The variation in the binding energy Eb with interlayer distance is plotted in Fig. 1(d). The calculated binding energy is −91.40 meV P−1 for an equilibrium interlayer distance of 3.32 Å in the BP/SnSe vdW heterostructure, and the results are in accordance with previous results corroborating the stability of the heterostructure.34
3.2 Photoelectronic properties
The electronic structure of the BP and SnSe monolayer, which is crucial to the formation mechanism of the BP/SnSe vdW heterostructure, was studied and is presented in Fig. 2(a) and (b). The calculated electronic structure indicates that BP possesses a direct gap of 1.62 eV, whereas SnSe has an indirect band gap of 1.48 eV, which is consistent with previous studies.10,33 After formation of the vdW heterostructure, the band structure is not a simple superposition of the BP monolayer and SnSe monolayer because it is influenced by vdW interactions. The projected band structure of the heterostructure is shown in Fig. 2(c), which shows that the BP/SnSe vdW heterostructure has an indirect bandgap of 1.27 eV for the VBM along the Γ–X line, and the CBM lies at the Γ point. The predicted 1.27 eV bandgap facilitates broad light absorption. The projected band structure also reveals that the VBM is predominantly composed by the electronic states of the SnSe layer (red line), while the CBM mainly comprises electronic states of the BP layer (blue line).

The projected density of states (PDOS) provides more information regarding the heterostructure, as shown in Fig. 2(d). The CBM is mainly characterized by the 3p orbitals of P atoms, whereas the VBM is characterized by the 4p orbitals of Se atoms. The decomposed charge densities of VBM and CBM in Fig. 2(e) provide similar results, in which the VBM is from the SnSe layer, while the CBM is from the BP layer. These characteristics indicate that the BP and SnSe monolayers form a type-II band alignment that can inhibit recombination of electrons and holes at the interface, giving rise to highly efficient solar energy conversion.
The band alignment and band offsets of the heterostructure are important parameters in the design of electronic devices. Fig. 3(a) shows the band alignment of the BP/SnSe vdW heterostructure, which is obtained using the vacuum level (Evacuum) as a common energy reference. Both the VBM and CBM of BP exhibit lower energy than SnSe, further verifying the staggered type-II band alignment in the BP/SnSe vdW heterostructure. Moreover, the valence band offset (VBO) and conduction band offset (CBO) are 0.56 eV and 0.51 eV for the BP/SnSe vdW heterostructure, respectively. The small CBO indicates that a large open-circuit voltage would be ideal for solar cells.

To investigate the charge transfer and separation between the BP monolayer and SnSe monolayer, the work function (difference between the vacuum level and Fermi level) of the monolayer and charge density difference of the heterostructure were determined. The work functions of BP and SnSe are 5.16 eV and 4.79 eV, respectively. Because charges tend to transfer from materials with a smaller work function to those with a larger work function until they reach the same Fermi level and obtain an electric potential difference, electrons traverse from the SnSe layer to the BP layer. Fig. 3(b) shows the plane charge density difference along the direction normal to the surface of the BP/SnSe vdW heterostructure, which is defined as follows: (7)where ρBP/SnSe(x,y,z), ρBP(x,y,z), and ρSnSe(x,y,z) are the charge densities at the (x, y, z) point of the BP/SnSe vdW heterostructure, BP monolayer, and SnSe monolayer, respectively. The insert shows the corresponding 3D charge density difference. The yellow area represents electron accumulation, and the cyan area shows electron depletion. The charges accumulate in the BP layer but are depleted in the SnSe layer, giving rise to charge redistribution at the interface and formation of an interface dipole. The Bader charge is further calculated to verify the direction of charge transfer and provide the specific quantity. It was determined that 0.084 electrons per cell were transferred from the SnSe layer to BP layer, and the holes remained in the SnSe layer. When the charge redistribution reached equilibrium, a built-in electric field was formed in the heterostructure pointing from the SnSe layer to the BP layer. The induced electric field weakened the Coulomb interactions between the photogenerated electrons and holes and facilitated separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs.
Optical absorption is another key parameter that can be used to describe the properties of photovoltaic materials. The optical absorption coefficient α(ω) is a function of energy along the armchair and zigzag directions of the BP/SnSe vdW heterostructure, and corresponding monolayers are shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b). The BP and SnSe monolayer exhibit a large absorption coefficient from visible light to deep ultraviolet light. Additionally, the absorption spectra of the heterostructure reveal large absorption coefficients covering the visible light to deep ultraviolet regions, and the optical absorption intensity reached 105 cm−1. For the BP/SnSe vdW heterostructure, the optical absorption intensity was significantly enhanced in the ultraviolet and deep ultraviolet region compared to the isolated layers. Especially in the deep ultraviolet light region, the optical absorption peaks were on the order of 106 cm−1. Moreover, the light absorption intensity along the armchair direction was different from that along the zigzag direction, indicating the anisotropic characteristics of the heterostructure. The improved optical absorption suggests enhanced efficiency pertaining to solar energy utilization.

3.3 Carrier mobility
The BP/SnSe vdW heterostructure facilitates separation of photogenerated electron and hole pairs, and thus, we further calculated the carrier mobility, which also plays an important role in photoelectronic devices. The carrier mobility is computed based on the deformation potential (DP) theory35 proposed by Bardeen and Shockley. According to eqn (3), three factors, namely the effective mass m*, deformation potential E1, and elastic modules C2D in the propagation direction of the longitudinal acoustic wave are the most relevant parameters for carrier mobility. The deformation potential E1 of the BP/SnSe vdW heterostructure is shown in Fig. S2 (see the ESI†). The calculated carrier mobilities of the monolayer BP, monolayer SnSe, and heterostructure are summarized in Table 2, which shows that the mobility of both the monolayer BP and SnSe as well as the BP/SnSe vdW heterostructure is anisotropic along the armchair direction and zigzag direction. BP and SnSe exhibits higher electron mobility along the armchair direction than the zigzag direction. This is because the electron mobility along the armchair direction is more sensitive to the changes in the energy band caused by lattice deformation than that along the zigzag direction. With regard to the hole mobility of BP, the armchair direction is larger than that of the zigzag direction, whereas the hole mobility in the zigzag direction is larger than that in the armchair direction for the SnSe monolayer. The calculated results are in good agreement with previous results.36

As for the BP/SnSe vdW heterostructure, the hole mobility decreases compared to the monolayer, while the electron mobility increases relative to BP. The electron mobility reaches 5.09 × 103 cm2 V−1 s−1 along the armchair direction. The predicted carrier mobility values for both electrons and holes of the BP/SnSe vdW heterostructure exceed 103 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is higher than the mobility of the InSe/GeSe vdW heterostructure.37 However, it should be noted that the DP theory still has some limitations in predicting the mobility,38,39 and experimental verification is necessary.
3.4 Power conversion efficiency
Because of the high optical absorption intensity, staggered bandgap, and high carrier mobility, the BP/SnSe heterostructure shows great application prospects in photovoltaic devices. We further calculated the PCE using Scharber's method,8 which has been used for other 2D heterostructures.40–42 The PCE contour of the BP/SnSe vdW heterostructure is depicted in Fig. 4(c). According to Scharber's method, the PCE is affected mostly by the CBO and donor bandgap. As aforementioned in the analysis of band structure, the donor layer is SnSe with a gap of 1.48 eV, and the CBO between BP and SnSe is 0.56 eV. According to eqn (5), the PCE of the BP/SnSe heterostructure is calculated to be 11.96%, which is much larger than those of MoS2/p-Si heterostructure solar cells (5.23%)43 and 2D perovskite homologues (4.4–6.9%).44 The PCE even compares to those of organic solar cells (11.7%)45 and AsP/CdSe heterostructure (13%).46 Analysis of the photoelectronic properties and PCE of the BP/SnSe heterostructure suggests that it has great potential application in solar cells.
Metal substrates are often used in the growth of 2D materials such as graphene on Cu47 and borophene on Ag.48 Gong et al. investigated the electrical contacts between monolayer phosphorene on metal substrates by first-principles calculation49 and the three metal substrates, Cu(111), Zn(0001), and In(110), have a small lattice mismatch with phosphorene. Monolayer phosphorene is stable on these pristine substrates with small bond distortions, and therefore, Cu, Zn, and In are suitable substrates to prepare the BP/SnSe vdW heterostructure. Based on the experimental results reported by Bai et al.,50 we propose a solar cell model of the BP/SnSe heterostructure. As shown in Fig. 4(d), we used Ag and ITO as the electrode materials, BP as the acceptor, and the SnSe layer as the donor. When photons are absorbed, electron transition occurs between the donor and acceptor.
3.5 Tunable electronic properties and improved PCE by strain engineering
It has been experimentally and theoretically demonstrated that compressive or tensile strains are an effective method to modulate electronic band structures.51 In this respect, 2D materials can sustain a certain strain effect as a result of lattice mismatch with the substrate or by slight mechanical loading.52 Here, we mainly focus on the in-plane biaxial strain between −5% and 7% to tune the electronic properties of the heterostructure. With regard to the in-plane strain, ε denotes the strain magnitude (percent) defined as ε = Δa/a0, where a0 denotes the unstrained cell parameter and Δa + a0 indicates the strained cell parameter. We first calculated the strain energy per atom, Es = (Estrained − Eunstrained)/n, where n denotes the number of atoms in the system. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the in-plane strain is in a perfect quadratic function with the strain energy changes, indicating that the system is flexible, and all the strains considered are within the elastic limit. Fig. 5(a) also shows the band gap of the heterostructure as a function of biaxial strain. The bandgap linearly increases, with the tensile strain reaching the largest value of 2.02 eV at ε = 5%. When the tensile strain exceeds 5%, the bandgap begins to decrease. On the contrary, when stress strain is applied, the bandgap exhibits a decreasing trend as the strain strength increases and reaches the smallest value of 0.31 eV at ε = −5%. The interesting indirect-to-direct gap transition is observed at ε = 3% tensile strain, but at ε = 5% tensile strain, the gap reverts to the indirect one, as shown in Fig. S3 (see the ESI†). The projected band structures under different strains are present in Fig. 5(d). The characteristics of type-II band alignment are maintained during the entire strain range.

In order to understand the bandgap evolution of the BP/SnSe vdW heterostructure under strain, the band edge and band offsets are calculated as a function of strain, as shown in Fig. 5(b) and (c). Fig. 5(b) shows that the VBM of BP slightly varies as the strain is increased from −5% to 5%, whereas the CBM of SnSe steadily decreases with strain. This increases the bandgap under strain from −5% to 5%. Moreover, the CBO and VBO initially decrease and then increase as the strain changes from −5% to 7%. According to the definition of PCE, it is largely related to the CBO between the acceptor and donor.53 The drop in CBO can result in a distinct upward trend of Voc, which can significantly enhance the PCE in solar cells. Here, the PCE reached the maximum value of 17.24% at ε = 5%, as shown by the black solid pentagram in Fig. 4(c), and the performance is competitive with that of the PCE of the BP/MoS2 heterostructure (approximately 16%).12 The 5% tensile strain can be experimentally realized by the substrate effect, and the tunable bandgap and PCE by strain engineering has a clear advantage for photovoltaic and solar energy applications.
4 Conclusion
In the BP/SnSe vdW heterostructure, the characteristic of staggered gap can physically separate electrons and holes, and the heterostructure exhibits broad light absorption from the visible to deep ultraviolet regions with an absorption coefficient of 105 cm−1. The largest carrier mobility of the heterostructure is 5.09 × 103 cm2 V−1 s−1 for electrons along the x direction, and 1.41 × 103 cm2 V−1 s−1 for holes along the y direction. By means of strain engineering, the PCE of the heterostructure is increased to 17.24%. These results provide insights into the design of high-performance solar cells and reveal that the BP/SnSe vdW heterostructure is very promising for use in photovoltaic devices.
The conclusions obtained in this work for BP/SnSe should be applicable to other closely related vdW heterostructures, such as BP/SnS, BP/GeS, and BP/GeSe, because their geometric structures and electronic properties are similar. The group IV monochalcogenides, consisting of GeS, GeSe, SnS, and SnSe, all assume structures that can be considered derivatives of orthorhombic black phosphorus, belonging to the space group Pcmn.33 When they formed vdW heterostructures with BP, they exhibited a staggered band alignment that facilitated the separation of photogenerated carriers and a gap value ranging from 1.0 to 1.5 eV.54,55 The suitable band gap and type-II band alignment characteristics suggest that they are promising materials for application in solar cells. Our results provide theoretical insights into strain engineering in BP-based vdW heterostructures and suggest routes for improving the photovoltaic performance for applications in optoelectronic and solar energy devices.
