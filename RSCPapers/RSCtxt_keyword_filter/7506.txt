    , Accepted 14th January 2023First published on 16th January 2023AbstractThe development of small molecule electron acceptors with near infrared (NIR) absorption has led to great progress in organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the stability is a barrier, limiting the further applications of these small molecule electron acceptors. In this study, using an all-fused-ring strategy, we have developed two NIR-absorbing small molecule electron acceptors, FM3 and FM4, with high stability, which are ADA’DA (A, acceptor; D, donor) structured 12-fused-ring systems. By extending the conjugation to the D fragments and introducing electron-deficient substituents on the A fragments, the band gaps of FM3 and FM4 could be continuously reduced to 1.44 eV and 1.33 eV, respectively, thus causing the absorption redshift to the NIR region. Both FM3 and FM4 exhibited excellent photo, thermal and chemical stability, which was attributed to their all-fused-ring skeletons. Organic solar cells using these molecules as electron acceptors exhibit power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 11.4% and excellent device stability. This work indicates that all-fused-ring molecules have a strong potential in the development of NIR-absorbing opto-electronic devices with high stability.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have received great attention due to their advantages of flexibility, light weight and semi-transparency.1–4 These merits allow OSCs to be used for portable electronics and building integrated photovoltaics.5–8 OSCs usually have the bulk heterojunction blend films of electron donors and electron acceptors as their photoactive layers.9–15 As a type of device that directly converts sunlight into electricity, the photoactive layers of OSCs should possess a strong sunlight harvesting capability, so that they can capture enough photons to achieve high light current.16–20 Compared with the UV-vis absorption region, the near infrared (NIR) absorption region accounts for 52% of the total energy in the solar spectrum.21,22 Considering matching energy levels and reducing energy losses, electron acceptors with near-infrared (NIR) absorption and a band gap of 1.2–1.6 eV are expected.23–27 In recent years, great efforts have been made in the development of non-fullerene acceptors with NIR absorption. This drives an explosive increase in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs from 11% in the era of fullerene acceptors to 19%.28–33
The typical small molecule acceptors are A–D–A or A–DA’D–A type molecules, such as ITIC and Y6.34,35 In chemical structures of these molecules, exocyclic vinyl units are used as the conjugated bridges to link an electron-donating ladder-type D or DA’D core with two strong electron-accepting terminal groups. Despite the breakthrough performance achieved by these acceptors, they suffer from low stability under light or alkaline conditions due to the vulnerability of the vinyl linkers.36–45 In practical application, OSCs need to be exposed to sunlight. In the fabrication of OSCs, the cathode interface layers containing amine groups, such as polyethylenimine (PEI), polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE) and amine-modified zinc oxide (ZnO), are usually used for electron collection. Therefore, it is very important to study the stability of small molecule acceptor materials under light or alkaline conditions. All-fused-ring molecules with double-stranded molecular frameworks have been used as a kind of unique organic semiconductors in optoelectronic devices.46–50 The fusion of aromatic rings to π-conjugated aromatic systems provides an effective method to improve molecular stability. Through fusion of adjacent aromatic rings, the vibration and rotation of the molecules in the excited state can be substantially suppressed,51–53 and the π-electron delocalization can be dramatically improved, which are beneficial to the improvement of the molecular stability. Recently, our group reported an ADA’DA-type all-fused-ring molecule, FM1 (Fig. 1),54 which was a ten-fused-ring π-conjugated system and exhibited excellent intrinsic stability. Although FM1 showed an optical band gap of 1.50 eV with maximum absorption at 769 nm, its absorption in the infrared region is very limited.

In this study, we developed two new ADA’DA-structured all-fused-ring small molecule electron acceptors, FM3 and FM4, with NIR absorption and high stability. The molecular design rationale is as follows. First, the ADA’DA-type molecular configuration of FM1 was selected to ensure suitable HOMO/LUMO energy levels and a modifiable framework; second, by extending the D fragments from thiophene to thieno[3,2-b]thiophene, a π-conjugate extended 12-fused-ring molecule (FM3) was formed to enhance the intermolecular interaction and reduce the optical band gap; third, by introducing electron-withdrawing substituents onto the terminal groups (A fragments), the LUMO energy level of the all-fused-ring molecule (FM4) was reduced, and the absorption spectrum was further red-shifted into the NIR region. Compared with FM1, the optical band gaps of FM3 and FM4 were reduced to 1.44 eV and 1.33 eV, respectively, with main absorption peaks located in the NIR region. Due to their all-fused-ring skeletons without active reaction sites, both FM3 and FM4 exhibited excellent photo, thermal and chemical stability. Using FM4 as the electron acceptor, OSC devices with D18 as the polymer donor exhibited a decent PCE of 11.4% and excellent device stability. This work demonstrates the potential of highly stable all-fused-ring electron acceptors with NIR absorption for opto-electronic applications.
Results and discussion
Theoretical calculations by density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level were conducted to explore the molecular configuration and frontier molecular orbitals. Fig. 2a shows the optimized molecular geometries of model molecules of FM1, FM3 and FM4 with all the long alkyl chains being replaced with methyl groups for simplification. Different from the banana-shaped configuration of FM1, the extended conjugated FM3 and FM4 exhibit wave-shaped molecular skeletons with 12 aromatic rings fused along the backbones. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), FM3 and FM4 exhibit nearly planar structures, which are beneficial for charge carrier transport. The frontier molecular orbitals of these model molecules are shown in Fig. 2b. The LUMOs of the molecules delocalize nearly over the entire π-systems and the HOMOs are mainly distributed on the core units. Compared with FM1, the expansion of electron-rich thiophene in D fragments upshifts simultaneously the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of FM3. And the upward shift of the HOMO energy level is larger than that of that LUMO energy level, leading to a decrease in the band gap in FM3. Relative to FM3, the introduction of electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms in terminal groups of FM4 significantly reduces the LUMO energy level, resulting in a smaller band gap. From FM1, FM3 to FM4, the calculated band gaps gradually decrease. This reducing trend of band gaps is consistent with the experimental results.

The all-fused-ring molecules FM3 and FM4 were synthesized using the routes shown in Scheme 1. For the synthesis of FM3, starting from 6-(2-butyloctyl)-12,13-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-12,13-dihydro-6H-thieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b][1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-e]indole (1), Friedel–Crafts acylation reaction with 2-bromobenzoyl chloride was carried out to afford 2, followed by Pd(0)-catalyzed intramolecular carbon-hydrogen activation coupling reaction to obtain all-fused-ring molecule 3. Finally, FM3 was obtained by the Knoevenagel condensation reaction of 3 with malononitrile. For FM4, a similar synthesis procedure to FM3 was adopted, but the difference was that the initial reaction material 2-bromobenzoyl chloride was replaced with 2-bromo-4,5-difluorobenzoyl chloride. It was found that the synthetic reactions of FM3 and FM4 produced high yields, which are likely to achieve mass preparation. The high-purity FM3 and FM4 were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectroscopy (MS). Both FM3 and FM4 are soluble in common organic solvents, such as chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB) and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB). According to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S1, ESI†), FM3 and FM4 exhibit excellent thermal stability with decomposition temperatures (Td) at 5% weight loss of 364 °C and 362 °C, respectively.

(iii) Malononitrile, titanium tetrachloride, pyridine, chlorobenzene, 50 °C. 
The absorption spectra of the all-fused-ring molecules in solution and in thin films are shown in Fig. 3a and b, and the related results are summarized in Table 1. Compared with the 10-fused-ring molecule FM1, FM3 in solution exhibits a red-shifted absorption spectrum with the maximum absorption peak at 744 nm, which is attributed to the extended conjugation of the D unit and enhanced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). For FM4 in solution, the absorption spectrum is further redshifted with an absorption maximum at 765 nm. From solution to thin films, the absorption bands of FM3 and FM4 become much broader, and the maximum absorption peaks are bathochromically shifted by 47 nm for FM3 and 79 nm for FM4. The redshift for films indicates that intermolecular interaction exists in the solid state of these molecules. Compared with FM3, the larger redshift of FM4 means the stronger intermolecular interaction caused by fluorine atoms. Notably, FM4 exhibits strong absorption in the 600–930 nm region with a maximum absorption peak at 844 nm, which indicates that FM4 has excellent NIR light harvesting capability. Based on the onset wavelength of the absorption spectra in films, the optical band gaps of FM1, FM3 and FM4 are calculated to be 1.50, 1.44 and 1.33 eV, respectively. Compared with FM1 and FM3, FM4 has the smallest optical band gap. The results suggest that the band gaps of ADA’DA-type all-fused-ring molecules can be effectively reduced by conjugate expansion and end-group substituent modification. Furthermore, we used the time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations to investigate the electronic transitions in the absorption spectra of FM3 and FM4, and the results are shown in Fig. S3 and S4 (ESI†). The main absorption bands of FM3 and FM4 are mainly assigned to the electronic transitions from HOMO → LUMO. Compared with the electronic transitions in other absorption bands, the oscillator strength of the electronic transitions in the main absorption bands is significantly higher, which matches well with the experimental spectra. These calculation results further confirm that the modification of segments within the all-fused-ring molecular structures can effectively regulate the absorption spectra.

In addition to absorption, we also tested the fluorescence property of the all-fused-ring molecules. The fluorescence spectra of FM3 and FM4 in CF solutions are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). Both FM3 and FM4 show the NIR fluorescence spectra with the maximum emission peaks at 795 nm and 812 nm, respectively. The Stokes shifts are 862 cm−1 (51 nm) for FM3 and 757 cm−1 (47 nm) for FM4. The small values of Stokes shifts are ascribed to their rigid all-fused-ring backbones.
The electrochemical properties of FM3 and FM4 were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV), and the cyclic voltammograms of films are shown in Fig. 4a. According to the onset potential of the oxidation/reduction waves, the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of FM3 and FM4 are estimated to be −5.56 eV/−3.83 eV and −5.61 eV/−3.92 eV, respectively. Compared with FM1, the HOMO energy levels of FM3 and FM4 are significantly higher, which are attributed to the stronger electron-donating nature of thieno[3,2-b]thiophene than thiophene. FM4 has deeper energy levels than FM3, especially the LUMO energy level, which is ascribed to the electron-withdrawing ability of fluorine atoms in FM4. The energy levels measured by CV are coincident well with the DFT results. The electron mobilities (μe) of FM3 and FM4 were evaluated using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method based on the electron-only devices. The electron mobilities of FM3 and FM4 films are estimated to be 2.93 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 5.98 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. 4b), respectively. This indicates that both FM3 and FM4 have excellent electron transporting properties.

To evaluate the stability of the NIR-absorbing molecules FM3 and FM4, we monitored their UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra in solution under different conditions. For comparison, we chose the classical small molecule acceptor in OSCs, 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((12,13-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]thieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]indole-2,10 diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (Y6), as the reference molecule. Fig. 5a shows the decay of maximum absorbance of the THF solutions of FM3, FM4 and Y6 during irradiation under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G simulated solar light. After illumination for 5.3 hours, the maximum absorbances of FM3 and FM4 solution were decreased by 44% and 50%, respectively, while the maximum absorbance of Y6 was reduced by 74% (Fig. S6 and S8, ESI†). Both FM3 and FM4 have slower degradation trends than Y6 under light irradiation (Fig. 5a). The chemical stability of FM3 and FM4 was investigated by treating them in a dilute THF solution (10−5 mol L−1) with 100 equiv. of ethanolamine for different times. As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†) and Fig. 5b, the absorption spectra of FM3 and FM4 solutions barely change over a long period of time, indicating that they have excellent chemical tolerance under alkaline conditions. In sharp contrast, the maximum absorbance of Y6 solution decreases rapidly after 30s and reaches zero after 12 h under alkaline conditions. The dramatic change in the absorption spectrum of Y6 is due to the breaking of the vinyl linker or carbonyl group by nucleophilic attack of electron-rich ethanolamine. These results indicate that the NIR-absorbing molecules FM3 and FM4 have excellent photostability and chemical stability.

The molecular stacking of the thin films of FM3 and FM4 was investigated by two-dimensional grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS). 2D-GIWAXS patterns and the corresponding out-of-plane and in-plane line-cuts are shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†). The FM3 film exhibits multiple reflections in the out-of-plane direction as well as (010) reflection at 17.72 nm−1 in the in-plane direction, indicating a preferred edge-on orientation. In contrast, for the FM4 film, the (010) diffraction peak at 17.63 nm−1 appears in the out-of-plane direction, indicating that it adopts predominantly the face-on orientation. The molecular orientation change of FM4 may be induced by fluorine atoms on its terminal groups. According to (010) reflection peaks of FM3 and FM4, their π–π stacking distances are 3.6 Å. The mean size of the crystallites of the two thin films was measured by calculating the coherence length (CL) of the (010) diffraction peaks using the Scherrer equation. The CL values of FM3 and FM4 are 12.4 nm and 2.8 nm, respectively, indicating that FM3 has higher crystallinity than FM4. Considering that the introduction of fluorine atoms on terminal groups affects the molecular charge distribution and molecular packing, we speculate that the low crystallinity of FM4 may be due to its suitable charge distribution and complex intermolecular interactions.55,56 The NIR absorption, low-lying LUMO/HOMO energy levels and high electron mobility enable FM3 and FM4 to be used as n-type semiconductors in opto-electronic devices.
We used FM3 and FM4 as electron acceptors to evaluate their photovoltaic performance. As shown in Fig. 6b, we selected a polymer D18 with high-lying HOMO/LUMO energy levels as an electron donor to blend with FM3 or FM4. The offsets of HOMO/LUMO energy levels between D18 and FM3 or FM4 are sufficient for efficient charge transfer (Fig. 6c). The OSC devices were fabricated with an inverted device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/D18:FM3 or FM4/MoO3/Al (Fig. 6a). The detailed device fabrication process is summarized in ESI.† The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices based on D18:FM3 and D18:FM4 under an illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 6d and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. The D18:FM3-based device exhibits a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.79%, with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.82 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 5.31 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.41, while the D18:FM4-based device exhibits a higher PCE of 11.36% with a VOC of 0.68 V, a JSC of 23.97 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.70. The preliminary photovoltaic performance indicates that both FM3 and FM4 can be used as electron acceptor materials for OSCs. Compared to the FM3-based device, the FM4-based device exhibits a lower VOC but much higher JSC and FF; the lowered VOC is related to the downshifted LUMO energy level of FM4, and the significantly improved JSC and FF may be attributed to the redshifted absorption spectrum of FM4 and the optimal blend morphology (vide infra). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the two devices are shown in Fig. 6e. The FM4-based device shows a photoresponse in the range of 300–940 nm with the maximum EQE value of 77% at 520 nm, which are wider and higher than those of the FM3- based device, respectively. The integrated photocurrents from the EQE spectra agree well with the JSC values measured from the J–V scanings.

The photovoltaic performance of FM3 and FM4 is obviously different, which stimulates us to systematically analyze the two devices. We investigated the charge-transport property of blend films based on D18:FM3 and D18:FM4 by using the SCLC method. The hole mobility (μh)/μe is estimated to be 8.42 × 10−4/6.07 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. S12a and b, ESI†) for D18:FM3-based blends and 3.10 × 10−4/1.64 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. S12c and d, ESI†) for D18:FM4-based blends, respectively. The more balanced charge transport of the D18:FM4-based blend is beneficial to the higher FF and PCE of its device. We also investigated the charge generation, collection and recombination behaviors of the two OSC devices by measuring the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) and the dependence of JSC on the light density (P). As shown in Fig. S13a (ESI†), the Jph value increases with Veff increasing in a low Veff region and then becomes saturated at a high Veff (>2V) for the D18:FM4-based device, while Jph does not saturate for the D18:FM3-based device. The Jph,SC/Jph,sat value (Jph,SC is Jph under shortcircuit condition, Jph,sat is Jph at saturation) is used to evaluate the charge collection probability in the OSC device. Here, the Jph at Veff of 2 V was selected as Jph,sat for the D18:FM3-based device. The Jph,SC/Jph,sat values of D18:FM3 and D18:FM4-based devices are 66.7% and 91.1%, respectively. This suggests that the charge collection of the D18:FM4-based device is more efficient than that of the D18:FM3-based device. The bimolecular recombination was analyzed using the proportional relationship between JSC and Pα, where α is the exponential factor. The α value close to 1 indicates that bimolecular recombination in the device is negligible. As shown in Fig. S13b (ESI†), the α values of D18:FM3 and D18:FM4-based devices are 0.94 and 0.95, respectively, suggesting the suppressed bimolecular recombination of the D18:FM4-based device. The more efficient charge generation and collection, and lower charge recombination are consistent with the higher device performance of the D18:FM4-based device.
The active layer morphology of D18:FM3-based and D18:FM4-based blends was studied by 2D-GIWAXS and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Fig. 7a and b shows the 2D-GIWAXS patterns of the blend films of D18:FM3 and D18:FM4. The corresponding out-of-plane and in-plane linecuts are shown in Fig. 7c. For D18:FM3 blend films, the diffraction peaks at 16.4 nm−1 in the out-of-plane direction and the diffraction peaks at 2.9 nm−1 in the in-plane direction are attributed to D18 (Fig. S11, ESI†), and the distinct (010) reflection at 17.7 nm−1 in the in-plane direction is assigned to FM3. This indicates that both D18 and FM3 crystallize during the film-forming process. For D18:FM4 blend films, the diffraction peaks at 16.4 nm−1 in the out-of-plane direction and the diffraction peaks at 2.9 nm−1 in the in-plane direction are attributed to D18, while the characteristic 010 diffraction peak of FM4 is not observed. We speculate that the crystallization of D18 governs the film-forming process in D18:FM4 blend films and dominates the phase separation morphology. The AFM height images of the two blends are shown in Fig. 8a and b. The surface of D18:FM3 blend films shows large-size domains with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 2.01 nm. In contrast, the surface of D18:FM4 blend films exhibits small-size aggregates with a low RMS roughness of 1.18 nm. This is consistent with the trend of phase separation size in phase images (Fig. 8c and d). Combined with 2D-GIWAXS results, the large phase separation in D18:FM3 blend films may be due to the high crystallinity of FM3. The large phase separation size of D18:FM3 blend films contributes to the low JSC and FF of the D18:FM3-based device.

A key issue towards commercial applications of OSCs is device stability,57–59 which is closely related to the stability of the active layer materials. The excellent intrinsic stability of these all-fused-ring molecules means that they should exhibit improved device stability. To verify it, we investigated the air storage stability of the air-processed OSC device based on D18:FM4, and compared it with the typical OSC device based on D18:Y6. These tested devices were unencapsulated and uniformly exposed to ambient air (temperature: 20–25 °C and humidity: 12–23%). The results are shown in Fig. 6f. After storing in an air atmosphere for 456 hours, the OSC device based on D18:FM4 can retain about 74% of the original PCE value. In comparison, the D18:Y6-based device exhibits a decrease in PCE by 47% after 456 hours. As shown in Fig. S14 (ESI†), we also tested the photostability of the devices under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G simulated solar light illumination. After illumination for 38 h, the D18:FM4-based device retained 84% of its initial PCE value while the D18:Y6-based device retained only 74% of its initial PCE value. Compared with the D18:Y6-based device, the D18:FM4-based device exhibits better air storage stability and photostability, which may be mainly attributed to the superior intrinsic stability of FM4.
Conclusions
In summary, based on the all-fused-ring molecular design strategy, we developed two fully fused duodenarycyclic molecules, FM3 and FM4, with NIR absorption and high stability. The optical band gaps of the two molecules were gradually reduced by extending the conjugation on the D fragment and introducing electron-deficient substituents on the terminal groups, resulting in the absorption redshift to NIR region. Due to their all-fused-ring skeleton structures, FM3 and FM4 show impressive stability. The NIR absorption, low-lying HOMO/LUMO levels, and superior electron transport properties of FM3 and FM4 enable them to be used as electron acceptors in OSCs. The organic solar cell based on FM4 exhibits a PCE of 11.4% and high device stability. This work provides an all-fused-ring conjugated molecular system with NIR absorption, which has potential for high stability OSC applications.
