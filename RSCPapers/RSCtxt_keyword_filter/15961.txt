    , Accepted 19th October 2022First published on 24th October 2022AbstractMotivated by the successful synthesis of penta-silicene nanoribbons using various experimental techniques, we design a new 3D silicon allotrope, labeled cco-Si48, by assembling such nanoribbons, confirm its dynamical, thermal and mechanical stabilities, and further study its electron/phonon transport and linear optical properties based on the state-of-the-art theoretical calculations. We find that cco-Si48 is a direct bandgap semiconductor with a gap of 1.46 eV, exhibiting a high hole mobility in the magnitude of 103 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a low lattice thermal conductivity of 6.33 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K. Unlike the commonly reported n-type silicon-based materials with high thermoelectric performance, the p-type cco-Si48 outperforms its n-type counterpart in the thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) value with a considerable value of 0.57 at 800 K. We further demonstrate that the electron–phonon interactions play a critical role in determining the optimal carrier concentrations for the peak ZT values. This work expands penta-silicene nanoribbons to their 3D assembled structure with new features and applications.
1. Introduction
Rational design and synthesis of new silicon materials are of great interest because of their compatibility with the well-developed silicon-based semiconductor industry. Penta-silicene nanoribbons (PSNRs) are such an example, and have been extensively studied experimentally and theoretically motivated by the theoretical prediction of penta-graphene.1,2 For instance, in 2016, Jorge et al.3 reported the pentagonal nature of perfectly aligned single and double-strand Si-nanoribbons grown on the Ag(110) surface. Later on, Geoffroy et al.4 carried out systematic studies to further validate the pentamer model of silicene grown on a reconstructed surface by grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction and scanning tunneling microscopy. In 2018, Sheng et al.5 studied penta-Si nanoribbons grown on Ag(110) by using non-contact atomic force microscopy and tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Yue et al.6 observed one-dimensional (1D) topological electronic states in PSNRs. Furthermore, based on the research progress in 1D PSNRs, Guo et al.7 carried out the first study on a stable 2D tilted penta-Si sheet, which exhibits in-plane ferroelectricity with a Curie temperature of 1190 K. Recently, Zhan et al.8 designed a semimetallic 2D tilted penta-Si sheet with distorted Dirac cones in the absence of spin–orbit coupling (SOC). When SOC is considered, it becomes a topological insulator with helical edge states and a gap opening of 2.4 meV at the Dirac point. These studies show that pentagon-based silicon nanostructures have received considerable attention. Because significant progress has been made in the synthesis of 3D porous carbon materials by using graphene nanoribbons as the building blocks for multiple applications,9,10 it is highly desirable to explore the possibility of design and synthesis of stable 3D penta-Si allotropes by assembling penta-silicene nanoribbons.
Meanwhile, in addition to the conventional applications of silicon-based materials in photovoltaics, the thermoelectric performances of these materials have been extensively studied in recent years, which are evaluated by a dimensionless figure of merit ZT = S2σT/(κe + κL), where a high ZT value indicates a high thermoelectric efficiency. Here, S, σ, κe, and κL are the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, electronic thermal conductivity, and lattice thermal conductivity, respectively. Despite the fact that diamond silicon is inappropriate for such applications due to its high thermal conductivity (∼150 W m−1 K−1),11 nanostructured bulk silicon12 and silicon nanowires13 have been developed as efficient thermoelectric materials with enhanced ZT values (0.7 at over 1200 K and 0.6 at room temperature, respectively) due to their inherited high carrier mobilities and reduced thermal conductivities. In addition, the thermoelectric properties of several other metastable silicon allotropes, like BC8 silicon14 and clathrate Si136,15 are also promising, because their complex geometries lead to decreased lattice thermal conductivities.16 Thus, it is intuitive to expect a good thermoelectric performance of the PSNR-based 3D silicon allotrope.
In this study, we rationally design a 3D silicon allotrope termed cco-Si48 based on the PSNR building blocks. We confirm that it is a thermally, dynamically and mechanically stable semiconductor with a direct bandgap. We perform electron transport property calculations by considering ab initio electron–phonon (e–ph) interactions, calculate the lattice thermal conductivity at the three-phonon scattering level, and evaluate its potential for thermoelectric applications. We further demonstrate the necessity to include e–ph interactions when calculating thermoelectric performances at ambient and high temperatures.
2. Computational methods
Our first-principles density functional theory calculations are performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)17,18 and Quantum ESPRESSO (QE) package.19,20 Geometry optimization and electronic structure calculations are performed using the VASP, where the interactions between ion cores and valence electrons are treated with the projected augmented wave method.21 The plane waves with a kinetic energy cutoff of 600 eV are used to expand the wave functions of these electrons. The exchange–correlation interaction among the valence electrons is treated by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional22 within the scheme of generalized gradient approximation (GGA)23 for geometry optimization and some property calculations and by the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional24,25 for the electronic structure calculations. A 9 × 9 × 5 k mesh is used in these calculations for the integration over the first Brillouin zone. The thresholds for the convergence of total energy and interatomic forces are 10−8 eV and 10−6 eV Å−1, respectively. The Nosé–Hoover thermostat26 is used to control the temperature fluctuation in the ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) simulations under the canonical ensemble in the VASP.
For calculating the e–ph interactions, the ground-state electronic structure is calculated at the GGA-PBE level by QE using the norm-conserving pseudopotentials from PseudoDojo,27 a kinetic energy cutoff of 60 Ry, a 6 × 6 × 4 k mesh, and an energy convergence threshold of 10−15 Ry. It is then transformed into the maximally localized Wannier representation28,29 with the WANNIER90 program.30 Density functional perturbation theory calculations are carried out using QE to obtain the dynamic matrix at a 3 × 3 × 2 q mesh. The e–ph matrix elements gmnν(k, q) are calculated on the coarse k and q meshes and interpolated on a finer 24 × 24 × 12 grid using the Perturbo code31 with the following equation: (1)where Mλ is the atomic mass of atom λ,  and  are the wave functions of the two electronic states coupled by the phonon mode νq with the frequency ωνq, eλανq is the eigenvector of the phonon mode νq projected on atom λ and the Cartesian direction α, and ∂q,λαV is the corresponding perturbation potential. The mode-resolved electron relaxation time is deduced from the interpolated e–ph matrix with an iterative solution of the linearized electron Boltzmann transport equation (BTE),32 from which the transport properties of charge carriers are calculated in Perturbo, including carrier mobility μ, electrical conductivity σ, Seebeck coefficient S, and electronic thermal conductivity κe.33
For calculating the intrinsic lattice thermal conductivity κL, an iterative solution of the linearized phonon BTE34 is used as implemented in the ShengBTE code.35 The solution to the BTE is applied to the following equation for κL values: (2)where α/β denotes the Cartesian direction x/y/z, Ω is the volume of the primitive cell, N is the number of uniform q points, and fBE0,νq, vανq and Fβνq are the equilibrium Bose–Einstein distribution, the group velocity and the mean free path of the phonon mode νq, respectively. The BTE is solved on a 15 × 15 × 7 q-mesh based on the 2nd-order and 3rd-order interatomic force constants (IFCs). The 2nd-order IFCs are calculated by using the finite displacement method36 as implemented in the Phonopy package,37 and the 3rd-order IFCs are obtained by least-square fitting from the interatomic forces in 300 randomly displaced 3 × 3 × 1 supercells of cco-Si48 using the HiPhive package.38 During the fitting process, 1% of the raw data is used as the test set. The cutoff radius for the 3rd-order IFCs, the ratio between the target IFC values and the raw interatomic force data and the goodness of fit values in the training and test sets are 6.0 Å, ∼1:9, 0.99987, and 0.99983, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Geometry and stability
Si atoms tend to form sp3-like hybridizations because the 3pz–3pz π bond between the adjacent Si atoms is weak. In the case of three-fold coordinated Si atoms, they tend to form a tilted geometry so that the electrons can congregate on one Si atom and lower the energy, as is the case with penta-silicene.7 To this end, we align the PSNRs along the y direction and stack them up along the x direction. After geometry optimization, the Si atoms in the PSNRs are distorted from the planar configuration, as shown in Fig. 1(a), so that each of the three- and two-fold coordinated Si atoms in the PSNR can form an extra chemical bond with an atom from the neighboring PSNRs at the x and z directions, respectively, leading to a periodic unit cell with a c-centered orthorhombic Cmca symmetry (space group no. 64) that contains 48 Si atoms. Hence, we refer to it as cco-Si48. Detailed information about the construction process can be found in Text S1 and Fig. S1 in the ESI.† The lattice parameters are a = 6.45 Å, b = 11.43 Å and c = 14.14 Å. In this structure, the 48 Si atoms occupy three nonequivalent Wyckoff positions, namely, 16g1 (0.315, 0.531, 0.919), 16g2 (0.185, 0.723, 0.924) and 16g3 (0.184, 0.374, 0.828), which are represented by the brown, pale gold and yellow spheres, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1(b) and (c). The atoms at the 16g1 and 16g2 sites are four-fold coordinated, forming Si4 rings and armchair-like Si chains that connect the stacked PSNRs along the x direction, respectively, while the atoms at the 16g3 site are three-fold coordinated, forming tilted Si2 dimmers and connect the adjacent PSNRs along the z direction in a head-on pattern. To check the experimental feasibility of this new silicon allotrope, we compare its formation energy Eform with that of other synthesized silicon allotropes, which is defined as Eform = E(silicon allotrope) − E(diamond silicon), where E(X) is the total energy of the silicon allotrope X on a per atom basis. The cco-Si48 structure possesses a low Eform value of 0.08 eV per atom, which is lower than those of many synthesized silicon allotropes including BC8 silicon (0.16 eV per atom) and R8 silicon (0.16 eV per atom) while larger than that of hexagonal diamond silicon (0.01 eV per atom). Together with its bottom-up design, the energetically low-lying feature of cco-Si48 indicates that it could be stabilized.

The green arrows denote the lattice vectors. (c) Optimized unit cell of cco-Si48. The blue dashed rhombus illustrates the shape of the primitive cell. 
We first confirm the dynamical stability of cco-Si48 by calculating its phonon band structure. For displaying the phonon band dispersion, the following high-symmetry path T(−0.5, −0.5, 0.5) → Z(0.0, 0.0, 0.5) → R(0.0, −0.5, 0.5) → S(0.0, −0.5, 0.0) → Γ(0.0, 0.0, 0.0) → Y(−0.5, –0.5, 0.0) → X1(−0.33, −0.67, 0.0)|X(0.33, −0.33, 0.0) → Γ → Z → A(0.33, −0.33, 0.5)|A1(−0.33, −0.67, 0.5) → T → Y is used, as illustrated in Fig. 2(a). The resulting phonon band structure in Fig. 2(b) has no any imaginary phonon modes, indicating that cco-Si48 is dynamically stable.

Next, we check the thermal stability of this structure by performing AIMD simulations at 500 and 800 K, respectively. These calculations simulate the thermal motion of atoms within 10 picosecond (ps) with a time step of 1 femtosecond (fs). A 3 × 3 × 1 supercell of the cco-Si48 primitive cell is used to avoid the fake stability caused by the unrealistic interactions between an atom and its periodic images. As shown in Fig. 2(c) and Fig. S2 in the ESI,† the total potential energies change slightly around constants in both simulations, and the geometry of cco-Si48 at the end of both simulations remains almost intact without broken chemical bonds, indicating that cco-Si48 is thermally stable at high temperatures up to 800 K.
Then, we examine the mechanical stability of cco-Si48 by calculating its elastic constants. The nonzero independent elastic constants of this orthorhombic system are calculated to be C11 = 172.56 GPa, C22 = 181.82 GPa, C33 = 137.23 GPa, C12 = 37.57 GPa, C13 = 33.34 GPa, C23 = 41.04 GPa, C44 = 41.81 GPa, C55 = 36.33 GPa, and C66 = 42.21 GPa. These elastic constants fully satisfy the Born–Huang criteria39 for an orthorhombic system,40 which require Cii > 0 (i ∈ [1, 6]∩), Cii + Cjj − 2Cij > 0 (i < j; i, j ∈ [1, 3]∩), and C11 + C22 + C33 + 2(C12 + C13 + C23) > 0. Thus, cco-Si48 is mechanically stable.
We also calculate the Young's modulus E of cco-Si48 with these elastic constants based on the following equation:41 E−1 = s11l14 + s22l24 + s3l34 + 2s12l12l22 + 2s13l12l32 + 2s23l22l32 + s44l22l32 + s55l12l32 + s66l12l22,(3)where  is the elastic compliance matrix and l1/l2/l3 is the cosine of the angle between an arbitrary direction and the positive direction of x/y/z-axis. The resulting orientation-dependent Young's moduli in the first quadrant (l1, l2, l3 ≥ 0) are shown in Fig. 3. The Young's moduli along the three axial directions are 159.97, 164.91 and 124.22 GPa, respectively, which are all local maxima. Such anisotropy can be expected because the Young's modulus is generally determined by the weakest part in the structure, which is along the direction where the penta-silicene nanoribbons are connected in the head-on pattern, since there are fewer Si–Si bonds while the minimum Young's modulus is found to be 99.93 GPa near the diagonal direction.

3.2. Electronic structure
Next, we calculate the electronic band structure of cco-Si48 at the HSE06 level. As shown in Fig. 4(a), cco-Si48 is semiconducting with a direct bandgap of 1.46 eV at the high symmetry point Y. For comparison, the band structure at the PBE level is also calculated and plotted in Fig. 4(a), showing a similar band dispersion with a smaller bandgap of 0.88 eV, because the PBE functional systematically underestimates the bandgap.42 Unlike the valence band maximum (VBM) in the band structure, the conductive band minimum (CBM) at the high symmetry point Y (denoted as CBM1) almost degenerates in energy with the other two electronic states on the high symmetry paths Y → X1 and X → Γ, which are denoted as CBM2 and CBM3, respectively. The energy difference between CBM2/CBM3 and CBM1 is only 0.01/0.02 eV, which can be covered by the thermal fluctuation at room temperature. Density of states (DOS) and projected DOS (PDOS) on different Si atoms are plotted in Fig. 4(a), which shows that the electronic states near the VBM and CBM are both nearly equally contributed by the Si atoms on the three nonequivalent Wyckoff positions. In addition, we analyze the band and k-point decomposed charge densities. As shown in Fig. 4(b), one can see that the electronic states near the VBM are indeed contributed by all the Si atoms, while, the electronic states near the CBM1 are mostly localized around the Si atoms at the 16g1 and 16g3 positions, and the electronic states near the CBM2 and CBM3 are nearly localized around the Si–Si bonds between the atoms at the 16g1 and 16g2 positions. The overall contribution from the CBM1, CBM2 and CBM3 adds up to the near-equal contribution from the different Si atoms to the PDOS.

Since silicon semiconductors with direct bandgaps usually show strong optical absorption, we calculate the linear optical responses of cco-Si48 and find that it would possess a predominant power conversion efficiency as a solar cell due to its strong optical absorption comparable to that of diamond silicon43,44 and its moderate direct bandgap, as is the case with Pd2Se345 and polymer–fullerene solar cells.46 More details can be found in Text S2 and Fig. S3 in the ESI.† It is also worth mentioning that the accidental degeneracy at the band edge is among the common mechanisms for strong thermoelectric response since it contributes to a large DOS. However, the carrier transport properties of such materials are rarely investigated because the commonly used Bardeen–Schockley equation47 (also known as the deformation potential theory) for obtaining the carrier mobility is not well defined when intervalley scattering processes related to degenerated electronic states are involved. Instead, we study these properties by directly solving the BTE for electrons at the e–ph level, as discussed in the following section.
3.3. Electron transport properties
We calculate the electron transport properties of cco-Si48 by using the Perturbo code31 as interfaced with QE.19 The electronic structure obtained by QE at the PBE level is comparable with that obtained from our VASP calculations, as confirmed by the electronic band structures from both approaches and illustrated in Fig. S4 in the ESI.† The electron and hole transport properties at the e–ph level are calculated in two separate calculations involving the Wannierized electronic states in the vicinity (±0.3 eV) of the VBM and CBM, respectively. The deeper energy states are neglected in the e–ph interactions because they are either nearly empty or almost fully occupied by electrons according to the Fermi–Dirac distribution, and they have little contribution to the scattering processes. The results are plotted in Fig. 5 as a function of the carrier concentration. For comparison, the electron transport properties of diamond silicon are calculated at the same level and summarized in Fig. S5 in the ESI.† As shown in Fig. 5(a), the electron mobilities (μe) along the x and y directions are comparable and are about twice as large as that along the z direction, while the hole mobilities (μh) along the y and z directions are comparable and are larger than that along the x direction by 50%. At a given temperature, the values of μe and μh along each axial direction converge to certain levels at low carrier concentrations, as summarized in Table 1. The hole mobility of cco-Si48 reaches up to 3.05 × 103 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 300 K, while the electron mobility of cco-Si48 is about an order of magnitude lower due to the complex scattering processes among the degenerated CBM1, CBM2, and CBM3 states. In contrast, the peak electron and hole mobilities of diamond silicon are ∼2000 and ∼200 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The electron and hole mobilities decrease with the increasing carrier concentration, since the properties of the carriers on the relatively deeper energy states deviate from those at the band edge. We note that the results in Table 1 diverge from the μ ∝ T−3/2 trend predicted by the Bardeen–Schockley equation for bulk materials,47 which can be attributed to the deviation of the electronic band structure from the ideal parabolic dispersion. The corresponding electric conductivities are plotted in Fig. 5(b), and are connected to the carrier mobility values based on the equations σe= neeμe and σh= nheμh, where σe (σh) is the electric conductivity from electrons (holes), ne (nh) is the electron (hole) concentration, and e is the elementary charge.

The electronic thermal conductivity κe of cco-Si48 is also calculated at the e–ph level, and the results at different temperatures are plotted in Fig. 5(c). While the famous Wiedemann–Franz law states that κe is proportional to the electric conductivity σ, leading to a constant scale factor termed Lorenz number L = κe/σT = 1.5 × 10−8 W Ω K−2.48 However, the κe/σT value at the e–ph level is dependent on the temperature, carrier, and the lattice structure,33 as shown in Fig. S6 in the ESI.† In particular, the κe/σT value at a hole concentration of 1018 cm−3 decreases to ∼6 × 10−9 W Ω K−2 at 800 K, and is 60% lower than that estimated by using the Wiedemann–Franz law.
3.4. Lattice thermal conductivity
In addition to the electronic thermal conductivity, we calculate the lattice thermal conductivity κL of cco-Si48 with the ShengBTE code35 to obtain an overview on its thermal transport properties. The 3rd-order IFCs as the input to the code are obtained using the HiPhive package.38 The calculated κL values of cco-Si48 at different temperatures are plotted in Fig. 6(a), which shows that the κL values along the x and y directions are comparable and are over 150% larger than that along the z direction. Such anisotropy in the lattice thermal conductivity coincides with that in its mechanical properties, where the Young's modulus along the z direction is also lower than those along the x and y directions, respectively. The κL values along the three axial directions all decay with the temperature in a T−1 relationship and the corresponding values at 300 K are 16.31, 18.57, and 6.33 W m−1 K−1 along the x, y, and z directions, respectively. For comparison, the κL values of other silicon allotropes are summarized in Table 2. The κL values of cco-Si48 are an order of magnitude lower than those of diamond silicon (146 W m−1 K−1)49 and are lower than those of some recently reported 3D silicon allotropes.50–52

The decrease in the κL of cco-Si48 with respect to that of the diamond silicon can be attributed to its weakened harmonicity and enhanced anharmonicity. The harmonicity can be represented by the group velocity (vg) and the weighted three-phonon phase space (WP3), which are obtained directly from the phonon dispersion. The calculated results are presented in Fig. 6(b) and (c). One can see that both the vg values of the acoustic and optical phonon modes in cco-Si48 are lower than those in diamond silicon, indicating that the phonon transport is damped in the cco-Si48 lattice, which is due to the complex phonon dispersion resulting from its complex primitive cell. The WP3 of cco-Si48 is much larger than that of diamond silicon, indicating more complex scattering channels. The two parameters indicate that the harmonicity of cco-Si48 is weaker than that in diamond silicon. Meanwhile, the anharmonicity of cco-Si48 is revealed by its three-phonon scattering rate (ω3ph) in Fig. 6(d) and its Grüneisen parameter (γ) in Fig. S7 in the ESI.† The ω3ph value of cco-Si48 is about an order of magnitude larger than that of diamond silicon in the low frequency region (<3 THz), indicating a strong anharmonicity in the cco-Si48 lattice, while more negative values are found in the frequency-dependent Grüneisen parameters of cco-Si48, leading to a total Grüneisen parameter of −0.71 at 300 K, which is twice as large as that of diamond silicon (0.35 at 300 K) in terms of absolute value. The large absolute value of the total Grüneisen parameter γ of cco-Si48 is consistent with its low κL values according to the empirical κL ∝ γ−2 relationship.53
3.5. Thermoelectricity
Based on the electron and phonon transport properties of cco-Si48, we examine its potential as a thermoelectric material by evaluating its ZT = S2σT/(κe + κL) at various temperatures and carrier concentrations. The Seebeck coefficient S is calculated by using the Perturbo code at the e–ph level. As shown in Fig. 7(a), in spite of the anisotropic nature of cco-Si48, its Seebeck coefficients along the different axial directions are almost the same. The Seebeck coefficients of the n-type cco-Si48 are larger than those of the p-type one due to the high DOS caused by the accidental degeneration near the VBM. The calculated ZT values are plotted in Fig. 7(b). Unlike the predominant n-type thermoelectricity in diamond silicon and many other silicon allotropes,12–14 the ZT values of the p-type cco-Si48 are larger than those of the n-type cco-Si48 due to its high hole mobility in the order of magnitude of 103 cm2 V−1 s−1. The optimal ZT values for p-type and n-type cco-Si48 are found to be 0.57 (nh = 1.34 × 1019 cm−3) and 0.41 (ne = 2.06 × 1020 cm−3), respectively, at 800 K and are both along the z direction. These values are about 9 and 3 times larger than those of diamond silicon, respectively, as shown in Fig. S8 in the ESI.† Considering the fact that nanostructures in diamond silicon lead to significantly improved thermoelectric properties,12 higher ZT values can be expected in nanostructured cco-Si48. It is also worth mentioning that the carrier concentrations corresponding to the optimal ZT values increase with temperature, which is different from the common results from many previous reports.54–56 This is because the carrier mobility at the e–ph level is a monotonically decreasing function of the carrier concentration rather than a constant provided by the Bardeen–Schockley equation. The decline in carrier mobilities at high carrier concentrations indicates that the transport of an average carrier is hindered, so that the peak value of ZT appears at even higher carrier concentrations where the hindered transport of an averaged carrier is compensated by the amount of carriers. In contrast, the constant carrier mobilities from the Bardeen–Schockley equation would underestimate the optimal carrier concentrations.

4. Conclusions
In summary, based on first principles calculations, we propose a new 3D silicon allotrope termed cco-Si48, which is the first silicon allotrope composed of the experimentally synthesized PSNRs and is thermally, dynamically, and mechanically stable. Different from silicene nanoribbon-based 3D silicon that is topologically semi-metallic,57 cco-Si48 is a direct bandgap semiconductor with a gap of 1.46 eV and a high hole mobility up to 3.05 × 103 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature. The lattice thermal conductivity of cco-Si48 is 6.33 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K, and is about an order of magnitude lower than that of diamond silicon due to its weak harmonicity and strong anharmonicity. The optimal ZT values of the p- and n-type cco-Si48 reach 0.57 and 0.41 at 800 K, respectively, making it a potential p-type thermoelectric material, which is superior among silicon allotropes. We also show that the e–ph interactions are important for a more accurate relationship between the optimal ZT values and the carrier concentrations. We hope that this study could stimulate experimental efforts in synthesizing PSNR-based materials and other pentagon-based materials for the applications in the field of energy conversion.
