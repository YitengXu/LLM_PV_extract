    , Accepted 15th April 2019First published on 15th April 2019AbstractA new D–π–A–π–D small molecule (VC7) based on a selenophene-flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole core and two Zn-porphyrin peripheral moieties was designed and synthesized. The optical and electrochemical properties of VC7 were investigated and compared with those of VC6, which has the same chemical structure but with thiophene units in the π-bridge rather than selenophene. VC7 exhibited extended absorption spectra in the near infrared region of the solar spectrum and showed improved hole mobility with a high HOMO energy level. After optimization of the active layers, VC7:PC71BM organic solar cells (OSCs) showed a significantly higher power conversion efficiency of 9.24% (JSC = 15.98 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.89 V and FF = 0.66) in comparison to VC6:PC71BM (PCE of 7.27%, JSC = 14.31 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.82 V and FF = 0.62); this result represents a 27% increase in efficiency. Our results show that the higher JSC value for the VC7-based OSC is due to a combination of the more extended absorption profile, higher hole mobility, more balanced charge transport and high exciton dissociation probability.
Introduction
Solution-processed bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted a great deal of attention from scientists around the world for the production of low cost, flexible, large scale and semitransparent solar panels.1–9 OSCs processed with a single BHJ active layer based on conjugated polymers as donors have shown overall power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 11–12% and 13–14% on employing fullerene derivatives10–12 and small molecule non-fullerene acceptors,13–17 respectively. In recent years, OSCs based on small molecules (SMs) as the donor component in the BHJ active layer have attracted attention due to their advantages over conjugated polymer counterparts, such as well-defined chemical structures, reproducible synthesis and negligible batch-to-batch variations.18–22 In addition to these advantages, the shorter length of SMs results in a lower entropic barrier and also reduced chain entanglements, thereby enhancing the molecular packing and aggregation in solid state, thus leading to enhanced inter-chain transportation. In recent years, the PCE values of OSCs based on SM donors have reached around 11% (ref. 23–25) and this is comparable to values obtained for polymer counterparts. Moreover, the optical and electrochemical properties of SMs can be easily tailored by the inclusion of various donor, acceptor and π-bridge groups and the D–A SMs show broad and strong absorptions, deeper HOMO energy levels, high mobilities and desirable molecular stacking.
Inspired by photosynthesis in nature, where chlorophylls are used as strong chromophores, porphyrin and its derivatives have been explored as SM donors. Porphyrins are analogues of chlorophylls and they have been explored as donors for BHJ OSCs since they have high absorption coefficients and their optical and electrochemical properties can be easily tuned by functionalization of the periphery. The overall PCEs of the OSCs based on porphyrin derivatives as donors have improved significantly (9–10%) through molecular design and device optimization, thus highlighting the porphyrin unit as an excellent building block for materials employed for OSCs.26–42
Among the various acceptor units used in the design of D-A small molecules (SMs), DPP has been used as promising acceptor due to its planar conjugated bicyclic structure, which leads to stronger π–π conjugation and a reduced bandgap in the resulting molecules.43,44 In order to improve the power conversion efficiency of OSCs, it is imperative to narrow the optical bandgap of the D-A SM to extend the absorption towards the longer wavelength region so that higher JSC values can be achieved. The absorption spectra can be extended towards the longer wavelength region (NIR) by replacing the thiophene with a selenophene unit. Selenophene is an analogue of thiophene in which the sulfur is replaced by a selenium atom. Selenium is larger than sulfur and it therefore has a lower aromaticity due to the poor overlap of selenium orbitals with the π-system of the carbon skeleton.45,46 As a consequence of these effects the quinoidal contribution to molecular energy levels is increased and hence a red-shift is observed in the absorption profile. Moreover, the Se is more polarizable than S and this may induce intermolecular Se–Se interactions and hence improve the charge carrier mobility.47
We report here the synthesis of a new D-π-A-π-D small molecule (VC7) based on diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) linked by selenophene to two outer Zn-porphyrins, as shown in Chart 1. The optical and electrochemical properties were investigated and compared to those of the analogue VC6,48 in which thiophene is used as a bridge instead of selenophene. VC7 showed a red shift in the absorption spectrum and lower bandgap with respect to VC6 and it also had enhanced crystallinity and better lamellar packing. Evaluation of the photovoltaic devices prepared with both donors and PC71BM showed an increase in all photovoltaic parameters (PCE of 9.24% with JSC of 15.98 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.89 eV and FF of 0.66) in comparison with VC6 (PCE of 7.27%, JSC = 14.31 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.82 V and FF = 0.62). The higher JSC and FF values obtained for VC7-based OSCs when compared to VC6 are due to the higher hole mobility and more balanced charge transport. This study demonstrates the advantages of using selenophene as a bridge in OSCs.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
Thiophene-based DPP derivative VC6 was prepared according to the procedure described in the literature.48 The synthesis of the selenophene-based DPP VC7 was carried out according to Scheme 1. 2,5-Bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,6-di(selenophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione49 (1) was reacted overnight at room temperature with NBS50 to give (2) in 80% yield after purification by column chromatography. Subsequent CuI–Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 catalysed Sonogashira coupling between 2 and 3 (stoichiometry 1:2)48 afforded the target compound VC7 as a black solid after purification by GPC (yield: 35%) and the purity was checked by HPLC (Fig. S7†). The chemical structures of both new compounds were verified by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, FT-IR and MALDI-TOF MS (for experimental details and spectra see ESI†). The thermal stability was investigated by TGA under N2 and this method showed good thermal stability with a decomposition temperature of 415 °C (Fig. S8†).

Theoretical calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G* level were carried out on VC7 using Gaussian 09. As shown in Fig. 1, this small molecule donor has a highly planar structure due to the marked planarity of the DPP core and peripheral porphyrins. In the case of VC6 (Fig. S9†), theoretical calculations showed a less planar that in VC7.
 Fig. 1  Molecular geometry of VC7 from the top and side views. 
The presence of the triple bonds linking the selenophene–DPP and the two porphyrin moieties combine to provide extended conjugation throughout the whole molecule.
The calculated HOMO/LUMO energy levels (in vacuo) are −4.71 eV/−2.96 eV, i.e., almost the same as those calculated for the related thiophene–DPP VC6 (−4.72 eV/−2.96 eV), and this indicates that the presence of selenophene instead of thiophene on the DPP core does not have a significant influence on the frontier orbital levels. Finally, the calculated HOMO–LUMO gap for VC7 (1.59 eV, Fig. S10†) is consistent with the electrochemical data (vide infra).
Optical properties
The optical properties of VC7 were investigated by absorption spectroscopy in toluene solution and in thin film (Fig. 2) and the results were compared with those for VC6; the corresponding optical parameters are summarized in Table 1. In solution both VC6 and VC7 exhibit almost identical spectra, with the maxima centered at 450 nm and 500–620 nm (centered at 592 nm) corresponding to Soret and Q bands, respectively; the main difference is observed in the third band, which is assigned to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between donor and acceptor units present in the molecular backbone; this band is red-shifted in VC7 (λmax = 724 nm) with respect to that in VC6 (λmax = 714 nm) and is also broader, reaching 800 nm. In the thin film absorption spectrum of VC7 the charge transfer band is significantly red-shifted with respect to that in solution, with a maximum at 858 nm and a shoulder at 778 nm (Fig. 2b). If the spectra of VC7 in film is compared with that recorded for the model compound VC6 in film (Fig. 2b) an increase in the intensity and in the spectral range of the absorption are observed for VC7, with a pronounced red-shift. These observations are due to the strong intermolecular interactions in the selenophene-containing SM as the selenium atom is more easily polarized than sulfur.51–53

The optical bandgap of VC7 estimated from the absorption onset edge in the absorption spectrum in thin film is 1.31 eV. This value is lower than that of VC6 (1.38 eV) due to the greater electron-donating ability and improved conjugation of the selenophene π-spacer.54–56
Electrochemical properties and energy levels
The electrochemical properties were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. S11†) and Osteryoung square-wave voltammetry (OSWV) and the corresponding redox potentials are listed in Table 1, with VC7 showing a slightly better donor ability than VC6.
Therefore, the corresponding HOMO/LUMO levels are estimated to be −5.44/−3.72 eV and −5.30/−3.91 eV for VC6 and VC7, respectively. In agreement with the theoretical calculations (vide supra), VC7 has a higher HOMO level than VC6 due to the stronger electron-donating ability of selenophene as compared to thiophene, which is consistent with the trend for previously reported selenium-containing organic semiconductors.57–61
Photovoltaic properties
The solution-processed BHJ organic solar cells were fabricated with a conventional device structure of glass/ITO/donor:PC71BM/PFN/Al (where ITO represents indium tin oxide, PFN is poly[9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene] and the donor is either VC6 or VC7). Details of the fabrication and characterization are described in the ESI.† Firstly, the BHJ active layer processed with a chloroform solution was optimized by varying the donor-to-acceptor weight ratio (results for VC7:PC71BM based devices are summarized in Table S1, ESI†) and it was found that a weight ratio of 1:2 provided best photovoltaic performance. The as-cast VC6:PC71BM- and VC7:PC71BM-based OSCs showed overall PCE values of 3.39% (with a JSC of 8.22 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.86 V and FF of 0.48) and 4.58% (with a JSC of 9.76 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.92 V and FF of 0.51). The active layers were further optimized by solvent vapour annealing with THF to improve the morphology of the active layer (Table 2). The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics under illumination (AMG1.5, 100 mW cm−2) and IPCE spectra of the OSCs based on optimized active layers are shown in Fig. 3a and b, respectively.

 Fig. 3  (a) Current–voltage (J–V) characteristics under illumination and (b) IPCE spectra of the OSCs based on optimized VC6:PC71BM and VC7:PC71BM active layers. 
We have made the OSCs based on the active layer VC7:PC71BM active layer processed using the DIO + pyridine as solvent additive, reproducing the same conditions that those published for VC6.48 The OSC showed overall PCE of 8.17% with JSC = 14.63 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.87 and FF = 0.64. After that, we have employed the SVA treatment of active layer to improve the PCE of the devices, as this is more effective to achieve the more favourable nanoscale morphology.
The OSCs based on an SVA-treated active layer (40 s in THF environment) showed overall PCE values of 7.27% (JSC = 14.31 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.82 V and FF = 0.62) and 9.24% (JSC = 15.98 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.89 V and FF = 0.66) for VC6 and VC7, respectively. It is worth noting that the OSC based on VC7 showed a higher VOC than VC6, although VC6 has a deeper HOMO energy than VC7, and this may be related to the low voltage loss, which will be discussed later. This characteristic may be related to the high dielectric constant of VC7 when compared to VC6, which would lead to a reduced exciton binding energy, and low LUMO and HOMO offsets are required for the exciton dissociation and charge transfer, thereby leading to low voltage loss. The IPCE spectra of the OSCs were measured in order to confirm the JSC values of the OSCs and these are shown in Fig. 2b. Compared to the VC6-based OSCs, the VC7 counterpart showed a broader response by over 50 nm in the longer wavelength region and this is consistent with the absorption spectra of VC7. Moreover, the IPCE values for the VC7-based OSC are higher than those of the VC6 counterpart over the whole wavelength region. The higher optimized IPCE and wider IPCE response (Fig. 2b) indicate that the VC7-based OSC has more efficient light harvesting and charge collection. The JSC values estimated by integration of the IPCE spectra of the OSCs are 14.24 and 15.87 mA cm−2 for VC6 and VC7, respectively, and these values are consistent with those obtained from the J–V characteristics of the respective OSCs.
The VOC value decreases slightly upon SVA treatment and this may be attributed to the morphological changes in the active layer and the reduction in the quasi Fermi level gaps.62
The charge transport within the active layer during charge transportation towards the electrodes is an important factor for the photovoltaic performance of the OSCs. In order to obtain information about the charge transport in these optimized OSCs, the hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities in the active layers were measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) employing the hole-only (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au) and electron-only (ITO/Al/active layer/Al) devices, respectively. The hole/electron mobilities in as cast VC6:PC71BM and VC7:PC71BM are 5.58 × 10−5/2.32 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 7.96 × 10−5/2.39 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The dark J–V characteristics of hole and electron devices based on optimized VC6:PC71BM and VC7:PC71BM active layers are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively (only for optimized devices).
 Fig. 4  Dark current–voltage characteristics of (a) hole-only and (b) electron-only devices for optimized VC6:PC71BM and VC7:PC71BM active layers. 
The devices based on optimized VC7:PC71BM showed higher μh values (2.26 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and μe (2.43 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) with a μe/μh ratio of 1.09 when compared to VC6:PC71BM (μh and μe are 1.88 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.38 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively) with a μe/μh ratio of 1.22. The higher hole mobility obtained for VC7 when compared to VC6 can be ascribed to the difference in the chemical structures of the two small molecules, i.e., the incorporation of a Se atom, which may provide pathways for holes to hop through molecules. The higher charge carrier mobilities and more balanced charge transport in the VC7:PC71BM active layer are consistent with the high JSC and FF values for the resultant OSC.
In order to obtain information about the effect of the different π-spacers in the small molecules on the charge generation and extraction mechanisms for OSCs, the variation of photocurrent density (Jph, expressed as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark) with effective voltage (Veff, is defined as V0 − Va, where V0 is the voltage when Jph is zero and Va is applied voltage)63 was measured and the results are shown in Fig. 5.
 Fig. 5  Variation of Jph with Veff for the OSCs for optimized VC6:PC71BM and VC7:PC71BM active layers. 
It can be seen from Fig. 5 that Jph reaches the saturation value (Jphsat) at high Veff values (15.25 mA cm−2 and 16.71 mA cm−2 for VC6 and VC7, respectively) and this indicates that all of the photogenerated excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers and subsequently extracted by the electrodes – this phenomenon is independent of electric field. The maximum charge carrier generation rate (Gmax) is estimated as Gmax = Jphsat/qL and the values obtained are 1.11 × 1028 m−3 s−1 and 1.21 × 1028 m−3 s−1 for VC6 and VC7, respectively. Since Gmax is related to the light harvesting efficiency of the active layer (absorption profile of the active layer) the higher Gmax value for VC7 is attributed to the broader absorption profile of VC7 when compared to VC6. The exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss) and charge collection efficiency (Pcoll) for the OSCs are estimated from the ratio Jph/Jphsat under short circuit conditions and at maximum power point, respectively. The values of Pdiss/Pcoll for OSCs based on VC6 and VC7 are 0.939/0.77 and 0.956/0.81, respectively, and these indicate that both exciton dissociation and charge collection are better for the OSCs based on VC7 than VC6.
In order to obtain information about the charge recombination under short circuit conditions, the variation of JSC with illumination intensity (Pin) for the OSCs was measured and the results are shown in Fig. 6a. The relationship can be described as Jsc ∝ Pinα, where a is the exponent factor and reflects the degree of bimolecular recombination.64 When a is unity, then all of the free charge carriers are efficiently swept out and collected by the electrodes prior to recombination, whereas in the case where a is less than unity bimolecular recombination occurs.
 Fig. 6  Variation of (a) JSC and (b) VOC with illumination intensity for the OSCs for optimized VC6:PC71BM and VC7:PC71BM active layers. 
The values of a estimated from the curves shown Fig. 6 are around 0.95 and 0.967 for VC6 and VC7 based OSCs, respectively. The higher a value for the VC7:PC71BM based OSC demonstrates that bimolecular recombination occurs to a lesser extent in this device when compared to the VC6:PC71BM counterpart. This finding could explain the higher JSC and FF obtained for VC7:PC71BM.
The relationship between VOC and Pin provides information about trap-assisted recombination at open circuit conditions65 and the results are shown in Fig. 6b. The relationship is described as Voc ∝ nkT/qln(Pin) where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature and q is the electronic charge. When the value of n is around unity bimolecular recombination is dominant in the OSCs. However, if the value of n is around two, then trap-assisted or Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) trap-assisted recombination is the dominant process. The calculated n values for optimized OSCs are around 1.17 and 1.09 for VC6 and VC7, respectively. The lower n value obtained for the VC7-based OSC indicates that trap-assisted recombination is suppressed in this device due to the higher hole mobility and more balanced charge transport.
The voltage loss or energy loss (Eloss), defined as Eg − qVOC (where Eg is the optical bandgap of donor or acceptor, whichever is lower), is an important factor for high efficiency OSCs.66–68 The OSC based on VC7 showed a low Eloss (0.42 eV) when compared to VC6 (0.56 eV) and this may be related to the higher VOC value for the VC7-based OSC, despite the fact that VC6 has a deeper HOMO energy level. The HOMO/LUMO offsets between VC6/PC71BM and VC7/PC71BM are around 0.66/0.38 eV and 0.80/0.20 eV, respectively. As discussed above, the Pdiss value for VC7 is higher than that for VC6, which indicates that this low LUMO offset (0.20 eV) value is sufficient for exciton dissociation and charge transfer. The probability of exciton dissociation depends on the exciton binding energy, which is inversely proportional to the dielectric constant of the material. Therefore, the dielectric constants of VC6 and VC7 were measured at 1 kHz using the device configuration ITO/active layer/Al, with the active layer consisting of the mixture of donor and acceptor, employing an impedance analyser. The values obtained are 3.93 and 4.56, respectively. The difference may be related to the dipole moment (confirmed from the theoretical calculations) and polarization in the small molecule due to the difference in the π-spacer unit between the porphyrin and DPP core. This difference may be due to stronger intermolecular interactions in VC7 due to the presence of the Se atom in the five-membered rings when compared to thiophene rings in VC6. Stronger intermolecular interactions would reduce the coulombic interaction and exciton binding energy Eb. The lower Eb value indicates that the low LUMO offset is sufficient for exciton dissociation and reduced voltage loss and a high VOC value is thus obtained for the VC7-based OSC.
In order to get more information about the high exciton dissociation efficiency in the VC7 based OSC as compared to VC6 counterpart, we have measured the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of pristine VC6 and VC7 and their blend with PC71BM and shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†). The pristine VC6 and VC7 showed strong PL intensity peak at 794 and 822 nm, respectively, when excited at 450 nm. The PL intensity of these donor materials was significantly quenched for their blend with PC71BM, indicating that there is an effective exciton dissociation and charge transfer in both the blended active layer. However, the quenching in more in VC7:PC71BM as compared to VC6:PC71BM, indicating that eh exciton dissociation efficiency is more in former as compared to later.
The crystallinity of the two molecules was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in thin film and the results are shown in Fig. 7. Pristine small molecule films showed two characteristics peaks in the XRD pattern. The (100) peaks observed at 2θ = 4.62° and 4.74° for VC6 and VC7, respectively, correspond to lamellar distances of 2.06 nm and 1.98 nm and the other peaks located at 2θ = 22.78° and 23.98° for VC6 and VC7 represent π–π stacking distances of 0.416 and 0.396 nm, respectively.
 Fig. 7  X-ray diffraction patterns of pristine VC6 and VC7 thin films. 
The smaller lamellar distance for VC7 when compared to VC6 may be due to the relatively higher polarizable radius of selenium and this leads to a higher degree of rigidity and stronger intermolecular interactions.57,58,60 The crystal coherence lengths (CCL) estimated from the (100) diffraction peaks are about 4.34 and 4.98 nm for VC6 and VC7, respectively. Moreover, VC7 showed a stronger (100) diffraction peak than VC6 and this demonstrates that VC7 has a higher degree of crystallinity. The CCL values for the (010) peaks of VC6 and VC7 are about 1.56 nm and 1.71 nm, respectively. These observations indicate that the crystallinity, π–π stacking and lamellar packing of VC7 are enhanced when compared to VC6, which is consistent with the higher hole mobility of VC7. High crystallinity is beneficial for charge transport and reduces the probability of bimolecular recombination, thus resulting in a high FF value, which is consistent with the charge carrier mobilities and exciton dissociation and charge transport probabilities in the OSCs.
The morphologies of the optimized active layers employed in the OSCs were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and the results are shown in Fig. 8. Both blended layers showed phase separation.

The optimized VC7:PC71BM thin film showed better bi-continuous D/A interpenetrating networks and a well-defined and uniform fibrillar morphology when compared to VC6:PC71BM. This may be beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge transport for OSCs and therefore higher FF and PCE values.
Conclusions
Selenophene has been employed as an alternative to thiophene in the conjugated backbone of a porphyrin–DPP–porphyrin small molecule VC7. When compared to the thiophene analogue (VC6), VC7 showed a broader absorption from the visible to the near infrared region, higher hole mobility, and smaller lamellar stacking and π–π stacking distances. After optimization of the active layer, the OSC based on VC7:PC71BM showed an overall PCE of 9.24% with a voltage loss of 0.42 eV, which is better than that of the VC6:PC71BM counterpart (7.27% with a voltage loss of 0.56 eV). The higher PCE is due to the improved JSC, VOC and FF values. The higher PCE of the VC7-based OSCs may be attributed to the more planer molecular conformation, broader absorption spectrum and more favourable active layer morphology for exciton dissociation and charge transport. These results indicate that the introduction of selenophene into the molecular backbone of the D–A small molecule may provide an effective approach to reduce the exciton binding energy and voltage loss and represents an effective way to achieve high efficiency OSCs.
