    , Accepted 1st July 2014First published on 3rd July 2014AbstractWe present a new transparent monolithic mesoscopic solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell based on trilamellar films of mesoscopic TiO2 nanocrystalline photoanode, a ZrO2 insulating layer and an indium tin oxide counter electrode (ITO-CE), which were screen-printed layer by layer on a single substrate. When the thickness of the ITO-CE was optimized to 2.1 μm, this very simple and fully printable solid-state DSSC with D102 dye and spiro-OMeTAD hole transport materials presents efficiencies of 1.73% when irradiated from the front side and 1.06% when irradiated from the rear side under a standard simulated sunlight condition (AM 1.5 Global, 100 mW cm−2). Higher parameters could be expected with a better transparent mesoscopic counter electrode and hole conductor for the printable monolithic mesoscopic solid-state DSSC.
Introduction
Since the first report by B. O'Regan and M. Grätzel in 1991, the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) has attracted much attention for its low cost, simple processing and short energy payback times.1–3 Meanwhile, building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) with translucent power windows and roofs is regarded as one of methods assembled construction esthetics and cost reduction, thereby the transparent bifacial DSSC has increasingly fostered scientific and industrial research especially on the transparent counter electrode (CE) such as Pt, graphene,4 graphene nano-platelets,5 graphene/PEDOT-PSS,6 NiS,7 PANI,8 PEDOT9 and so on. However, all of these strategies are focused on the conventional sandwich structured DSSC based on two transparent conducting glasses, which still suffer from the leakage, corrosion and long-term stability problems of the liquid-state electrolytes in practical application. Normally, these issues could be avoided by replacing the liquid electrolyte with a solid-state intermedium such as organic10–12 or inorganic13,14 hole transporting materials (HTM). Since first reported by Bach et al. in 1998,11 the amorphous organic material spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N′-di-p-methoxy-phenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene) has been considered as the most promising HTM for solid-state DSSCs, due to its high glass transition temperature, high solubility and proper absorption spectrum.15 However, there are few reports on the transparent monolithic solid-state DSSCs with the spiro-OMeTAD and a transparent counter electrode. Although the Pt electrode could be prepared by depositing a thin layer, a major problem of encountered is the high reflectivity.16 For graphene, PANI and PEDOT organic materials based counter electrodes, the thickness is required to be up to several micrometers to obtain the desired conductivity,17,18 which makes it difficult to retain transparency. Interestingly, in 2012 Chiang et al. reported a solid-state DSSC based on a transparent tin doped indium oxide (ITO) film CE through sputtering technology and obtained an efficiency of 1.96% from photoanode side illumination and 1.50% from ITO side illumination.19 In order to prevent the organic layer from being damaged during the sputtering process, an Au thin film was deposited between spiro-OMeTAD and the ITO film CE. Obviously, the sputtering technology is not only a complicated and high energy consuming process, but the usage of Au will further increase the material cost and reduce the transmittance of the device. Indeed, there is still an issue to find a high quality and reproducible transparent CE for lowering the cost of the transparent solid-state DSSC.
Herein, we first employed a transparent mesoscopic ITO CE (ITO-CE) to assemble a bifacial transparent monolithic solid-state DSSC. The revolutionary design is that the TiO2 photoanode, the ZrO2 insulating layer and the ITO-CE could be screen-printed layer by layer on a single substrate such as fluorine-doped tine oxide (FTO) glass, then sensitized with a dye such as D102 and filled with the hole transport materials such as spiro-OMeTAD. Obviously, this design avoids the damage of the sputtering process on the spiro-OMeTAD surface and offers an enhanced contact between the hole transport material and CE for the use of the mesoscopic structure with large surface-area. As a result, efficiencies of 1.73% from FTO side illumination and 1.06% from ITO side illumination were obtained within the transparent monolithic solid-state DSSC.
Experimental
ITO nanoparticles were synthesized by a simple solvothermal method. Briefly, 36 ml InCl3·4H2O (4.981 g, 0.02 mol) ethylene glycol solution, 4 ml SnCl4 (0.521 g, 0.002 mol) ethylene glycol solution and 40 ml NaOH (3.2 g, 0.08 mol) ethylene glycol solution were mixed together and agitated at 0 °C. Then the suspension was transferred to a 250 ml Teflon-lined autoclave and aged at 250 °C for 24 hours.
The ITO nanoparticles were washed and separated by centrifugation 3 times sequentially with water and ethanol. Then, ITO nanoparticles, hydroxypropyl cellulose (Sigma) and terpineol (Sigma) were mixed in an agate jar, and the mixture was stirred vigorously via ball milling for 2 h. The mass ratio of ITO:cellulose:terpineol was controlled at 1:0.3:5.
Typical monolithic solid-state DSSCs were fabricated as follows: FTO glass substrates were etched with a laser and cleaned ultrasonically for 10 minutes with detergent, deionized water and ethanol, successively. FTO glass plates with high transparency in the visible range were purchased from CSG Holding Co. Ltd. A compact TiO2 layer was deposited on the patterned FTO substrate by spray pyrolysis, and after the temperature was cooled down to room temperature, a TiO2 layer was printed on the compact TiO2 layer and then dried for 10 min at 70 °C to remove the solvent in the layer. After that, the ZrO2 layer was printed on the TiO2 layer and then dried for 10 min at 70 °C. Finally, the ITO layer was printed on the ZrO2 layer and then were gradually heated to 325 °C at a speed of 10 °C min−1 and kept for 5 min, to 375 °C at a speed of 7.5 °C min−1 and kept for 5 min, to 450 °C at a speed of 5 °C min−1 and kept for 15 min, and finally, to 500 °C at a speed of 5 °C min−1 and kept for 30 min. After the temperature was reduced to 80 °C, the device was immersed in D102 solution [0.5 mM in CH3CN:t-BuOH (1:1)] for 12 hours. Finally, the spiro-OMeTAD HTM solution was dropped into the ITO layer and heated at 50 °C until dried. The spiro-OMeTAD solution was obtained as follows: spiro-OMeTAD was dissolved in chlorobenzene at a concentration of 0.15 M, and then 0.021 M LiTFSI and 0.12 M TBP were added.
The sheet resistance of the films composed with ITO nanoparticles after sintering was measured with a four-point probe detector (KDY-1, Guangzhou Kunde Ltd). The thickness of the film was measured with a profilometer (Veeco Dektak 150). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were obtained using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The structure of the monolithic solid-state DSSC was observed by scanning electron microscopy (Nova NanoSEM450). The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) pattern was observed using a Tecnai G2-20 Twin. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the cell was carried out on a potentiostat (EG&G, M2273) in darkness and processed with Zview software. Photocurrent density–voltage characteristics were measured with a Keithley 2400 source meter under illumination with an Oriel solar simulator composed of a 1000 W xenon arc lamp and AM 1.5 G filters. The illuminated active area was obtained with a black mask containing a circular hole of 0.13 cm2. The incident photon conversion efficiency was measured with a QE/IPCE Measurement Kit system (Newport, USA).
Results and discussion
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the film composed with ITO nanoparticles deposited on glass substrate is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The peaks at 21.58°, 30.58°, 35.54°, 37.45°, 42.02°, 45.86°, 51.12°, 55.94° and 60.84° corresponding to (211), (222), (400), (411), (332), (431), (440), (611) and (622) obviously indicate that the ITO nanocrystals in the films have a simple cubic structure. Using Scherrer's Equation, the average diameter of the ITO nanoparticles is 18.8 nm, as calculated from the broadening of the (222) XRD peak. This could also be confirmed by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the ITO nanoparticles shown in Fig. 1a. It could be found that in the TEM image, most of the ITO nanoparticles have a cubic structure and the average size of the nanoparticles is around 19 nm, which is in accordance with the diameter calculated from the XRD results. The surface pattern of the transparent mesoscopic conductive ITO film presented in Fig. 1b exhibits characteristics of multi-pores in a mesoscopic film, which was obtained after sintering at 500 °C for 30 min. The mesoscopic film allows the dye (D102) to pass through ITO-CE and to be adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface. At the same time, spiro-OMeTAD HTM could penetrate into the mesoscopic pores of TiO2 and ZrO2 layers. Such cube-shaped ITO nanoparticles might be expected to show lower interfacial resistance than uncontrolled particles due to the larger contact area between the cube-shaped nanoparticles, which reduced the interfacial resistance.20 In this case, the sheet resistance R□ of the transparent mesoscopic conductive ITO film was measured with a four-point probe detector, and the thickness of the film was characterized with a profilometer, indicating the electrical resistivity ρ is low at 0.247 ± 0.004 Ω cm.

Fig. 2a shows the schematic structure of a bifacial transparent mesoscopic solid-state DSSC with the ITO-CE. A compact TiO2 layer was deposited on the FTO substrate by a spray pyrolysis method, and a TiO2 mesoscopic layer, a ZrO2 insulating layer and an ITO-CE layer were screen-printed layer by layer on the compact TiO2 layer in order. After the triple-layers were sintered at 500 °C for 30 min, the ethyl cellulose was removed and then the pores in the multi-layers were formed and combined to create an interconnected channel structure. Then, the spiro-OMeTAD HTM solution penetrated through the channels and filled the pores in the multi-layer structure. Fig. 2b illustrates the SEM cross-sectional image of the solid-state DSSC with an ITO-CE, in which an optimized ∼2.1 μm ITO layer, a ∼2.2 μm TiO2 layer and a ∼1.5 μm ZrO2 layer15,21 are observed.

The power conversion efficiency of the solid-state DSSC heavily relies on its series resistance Rs, charge transfer resistance Rct and recombination resistance Rrec, which is related to the HTM filling fraction and R□. Indeed, increasing the thickness of ITO layer would result a decrease in R□ but make it more difficult to realize complete HTM filling. In order to obtain high efficiency with the bifacial transparent mesoscopic solid-state DSSCs, the thickness of ITO-CE has been optimized to get a compromise between R□ and pore filling of HTM. Herein, electrochemical impendence measurement (EIS) was carried out for the solid-state DSSCs based on ITO-CEs of different thicknesses, and their Nyquist plot and the equivalent circuit are presented in Fig. 3. We marked the solid-state DSSCs based on ITO-CEs with thicknesses of 1.1 μm, 2.1 μm, 3.1 μm and 4.0 μm as S1, S2, S3 and S4, respectively. The semicircle in the low frequency region represents the Rrec at the spiro-OMeTAD/TiO2 interface. In the high frequency region, the expected feature for a diffusion process is a Warburg circuit, consisting of a straight line, which closes into an arc.22,23 Usually, only an incomplete arc is obtained. In the present case, it is more convenient to simplify the model of this feature to a parallel R–C sub-circuit.23 With this equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Fig. 3, the characteristic parameters are obtained from the impedance spectra of the solid-state DSSCs with different thicknesses of ITO-CEs and summarized in Table 1. Clearly, with the increase in the thickness of the ITO layer from 1.1 μm to 3.1 μm, the Rs calculated from the Z-view software shows a large reduction from 755 to 216 Ω cm2, which is mainly attributed to the decrease in the R□ caused by the increased thickness of the ITO mesoscopic layer. However, when further increasing the thickness of the ITO mesoscopic layers to 4.0 μm, the Rs presents a slight increase to 287 Ω cm2, which may be expounded by the poor filling of HTM in the high-thickness mesoscopic films, leading to a slight decrease in the conductivity. However, when the ITO layer thickness increases from 1.1 μm to 4.0 μm, both the charge transfer resistance Rct and the recombination resistance Rrec present a persistent decline, which means that charge transfer at the interface of spiro-OMeTAD HTM/ITO layer is more quickly and the recombination of electrons and holes at the interface of TiO2/dye/spiro-OMeTAD is higher for thicker ITO-CE. Indeed, the reduced Rct could be attributed to the decreased R□ of ITO-CE and the much larger contact area between spiro-OMeTAD and the ITO mesoscopic layer owing to the increased thickness of the ITO-CE. However, as the thickness of the ITO-CE increases, the pore filling of spiro-OMeTAD in multi-mesoscopic films becomes more difficult because of the deeper channels in the device, which lead to poor conductivity of spiro-OMeTAD in the mesoscopic film and higher recombination of electron and hole pairs at the interface of TiO2/dye/spiro-OMeTAD.

The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of solid-state DSSCs based on ITO-CEs of different thicknesses are presented in Fig. 4. Obviously, when the thickness of the ITO-CE increases from 1.1 μm to 4.0 μm, the open-circuit photovoltaic (Voc) of the devices presents a slight decrease from 0.80 V to 0.77 V. However, obvious changes are observed in the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc). Compared with the other three devices, device S1 shows the smallest Jsc of 3.42 mA cm−2, which may be caused by the largest series resistance about 755 Ω cm2. In contrast, the devices of S2, S3 and S4 show similar values of Jsc of 4.70, 4.56 and 4.58 mA cm−2, respectively, where similar series resistances of 227, 216, and 287 Ω cm2 were obtained for these devices. As the thickness of the ITO-CEs increases from 1.1 μm to 2.1 μm, the fill factor increases significantly from 0.40 to 0.46, which could be attributed to the decrease of the series resistances. However, when the thickness further increases from 2.1 μm to 4.0 μm, the FF is reduced to 0.35, which agrees well with the results of EIS and could be attributed to the poor pore filling and high recombination of electrons and holes at the TiO2/dye/spiro-OMeTAD interface24–27 for the thicker channels. As a result, the optimized efficiency of the solid-state DSSC with a 2.1 μm ITO-CE is 1.73% under AM 1.5 G irradiation.

Indeed, the solid-state DSSCs with ITO-CEs present high transparency as shown in the inset of Fig. 5. In order to investigate the optical characterization of ITO-CEs, an ultraviolet-visible spectroscope was used to detect the transmittance of FTO glass, ITO-CE and solid-state DSSCs based on ITO-CEs, and the results are presented in Fig. 5. Above 400 nm, the ITO-CE led to a transmittance greater than 83%. However, the transmittance of the device solid-state DSSC sharply decreases to about 30% as the wavelength decreases to 550 nm and further decreases to 20% at 400 nm, which could be attributed to the absorption of the D102 and spiro-OMeTAD.

Fig. 6a shows the J–V curves of the optimized monolithic solid-state DSSC S2 from the front and rear side under AM 1.5 illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Clearly, the device S2 irradiated from the front side shows a Voc of 0.80 V, Jsc of 4.70 mA cm−2, FF of 0.46, and an efficiency of 1.73%. However, when irradiated from the rear side, its curve (S2-R) exhibits an efficiency of 1.06%, approaching 61% of that when irradiated from the front side. Note that the main causes of efficiency loss is the Jsc, which is decreased to 2.51 mA cm−2, corresponding to a loss of about 47% compared to S2. This difference in Jsc could also be observed in the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE), which is defined as the number of charge carriers collected per incident photon. Fig. 6b presents the IPCE spectra corresponding to the front and rear illumination of S2. It could be found that the IPCE spectrum of the device under rear illumination is lower than that of the device under the front illumination of S2 from 400 nm to 625 nm, which agrees well with the result for Jsc in S2 and S2-R. Indeed, when the light is irradiated from the rear side, it must first pass through the spiro-OMeTAD capping layer, ITO layer and ZrO2 layer in this multi-hybrid junction of the device. Although the ITO-CE presents high transparency, spiro-OMeTAD radical cations could absorb light that competes with light harvesting of dye molecules and decreases the effective light absorption. In addition, it was found that the charge transport in TiO2 film is the limiting process rather than hole transport in HTM.28 Therefore, irradiation from the rear side will form a charge distribution profile with more photo-generated charges far away from the FTO and suffer from collection losses due to a longer transport distance through the TiO2 film.19 Interestingly, the Voc of S2 is about 0.05 V higher than that of S2-R irradiated from the ITO-CE side. This difference in Voc could be considered as a result of the interfacial kinetics between injected electrons and back transfer electrons. Under open-circuit conditions, the rate of injected electrons from dyes is balanced with that of back transfer electrons from TiO2 to spiro-OMeTAD or dyes. Assuming dye regeneration is efficient, recombination from TiO2 to dye is negligible; thus, Voc is given by J. Bisquert et al.29 and L. M. Peter30,31 as follows:  where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, q is the electronic charge, τ0 is an electron life time, α is the ratio of surface electron concentration participating in recombination to electrons in the TiO2 and n0 is the electron concentration in the conduction band in the dark. Obviously, the higher Jsc leads to the higher Voc when irradiated from the front side than from the rear side.

Conclusions
We first report a bifacial transparent monolithic solid-state DSSC based on a mesoscopic ITO-CE. The key trilamellar films consisting of a mesoscopic TiO2 photoanode, a ZrO2 insulating layer and an ITO-CE could be fully screen-printed layer by layer, where the mesoscopic, transparent, and conductive ITO film presents a low resistivity of 0.247 Ω cm. Under a standard simulated sunlight condition (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2), an efficiency of 1.73% from the front of the solid-state DSSC and an efficiency of 1.06% from the rear side of the device are obtained. This fully printable transparent monolithic solid-state DSSC presents extensive application prospect such as BIPV. A further improvement in efficiency of the fully printable transparent monolithic solid-state DSSC could be expected with higher conductivity and work function CE.
