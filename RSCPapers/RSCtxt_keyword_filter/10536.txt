    , Accepted 27th October 2021First published on 28th October 2021AbstractNon-fullerene acceptors led to outstanding improvements in the efficiency of organic photovoltaic devices, with high promises of further advancements. Several studies have been performed to rationalise their exceptional performances, with the final goal of developing a reliable protocol for the identification of new materials with better properties. In this respect, we here combine molecular dynamics, density functional theory and Fermi's Golden Rule (FGR) to model two recent all-small-molecule bulk heterojunctions with high power conversion efficiencies, namely ZR1:IDIC-4Cl and ZR1:Y6 (Nat. Commun. 2019, 10, 5393). We evaluate the FGR rates for photoinduced hole and electron transfer, excitation energy transfer, and charge recombination on a statistical ensemble of donor/acceptor pairs extracted from molecular dynamics simulations. Our results provide a simple rationalisation of the great performance of Y6: aside from a slower charge recombination rate, we found that the charge transfer state for ZR1:Y6 can be accessed both via electron and hole transfer, while the latter pathway is significantly slower for IDIC-4Cl, indicating that its first excited state behaves as a trap, as confirmed by a simple kinetic model. In light of the recently reported possibility of developing donors and acceptors with complementary absorption spectra, multiple photoexcited charge transfer pathways represent a key property to efficiently harvest the whole solar spectrum.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSC) are among the most promising devices for renewable energy production, because of their potential advantages over traditional silicon devices, such as light weight, improved mechanical properties and lower fabrication cost.1–3 In the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architecture of an OSC, the domains of electron acceptor (A) and electron donor (D) molecules interpenetrate each other,4,5 showing a heterointerface distributed throughout the whole bulk of the active layer, which ensures the required film thickness for an adequate absorption of radiation6 while reducing the distance that excitons must cover to reach the D/A interface, ultimately leading to high Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE). The first generations of BHJs were mainly based on fullerene derivatives as acceptors, due to their relatively high electron mobility and air stability, reaching PCEs over 11%.7 However, fullerene-type acceptors have significant limitations, e.g. limited tunability for energy levels, weak absorption in the visible and near-infrared regions, and morphological instability, which hinder further progress in this technology.8,9 For this reason, in the last years, research focused on the design of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) consisting of fused-ring structures built from donor and acceptor moieties.9,10 The first NFA, developed by Zhan's group,11 was based on an A–D–A structure and led to PCEs up to 13%.12,13 Still higher efficiencies were achieved after the development of acceptors with A–D–A′–D–A structures, in particular Y6,14 which led to a record PCE for single-junction OSCs of 18%.15 The vast majority of these works focused on polymeric donors, often polythiophene derivatives. Unfortunately, polymeric materials have poor batch-to-batch reproducibility, a problem which severely hinders the application of this technology on the industrial scale. To overcome this limitation, there have been major efforts in developing small-molecule donors,16–18 reaching PCEs up to 15%.17
Up to now, identification of novel materials with better properties has been largely based on empirical intuition and on trial and error approaches.19,20 However, long turnaround times of synthesis and characterisation limit the number of new compounds that can be studied per year.21,22 In this respect, theoretical studies could lead to the identification of new organic semiconductors for various applications in a reduced amount of time, as demonstrated in recent studies.20,23–25 Nevertheless, when dealing with solar cells, it has to be kept in mind that the overall efficiency of the device depends on the rates of several elementary charge transfer processes that can take place at the D/A interface, some of them schematically shown in Fig. 1; thus, reliable and fast protocols for evaluating such rates from first principles are needed.

In this work we combine state-of-the-art approaches, i.e. Molecular dynamics (MD), density functional theory (DFT) and Fermi's Golden Rule (FGR) simulations to develop such a protocol, with the aim of finding a rationale behind the experimentally observed higher efficiency for organic solar cells exploiting Y6 with respect to the ones using IDIC derivatives, a highly debated topic in the research community.26–28 In particular, we focus on two all-small-molecule BHJs with high experimental PCE recently reported in the literature, namely ZR1:IDIC-4Cl (PCE ≈ 9.6%) and ZR1:Y6 (PCE ≈ 14.4%).17 We parameterise accurate quantum-mechanically derived force fields (QMD-FFs) for these molecules (see Fig. 1), to model the blends used in BHJs through classical MD simulations. We evaluate electronic couplings for charge recombination (CR), photoinduced electron transfer (PET), photoinduced hole transfer (PHT), and excitation energy transfer (EET) on thousands different D/A arrangements extracted from the MD trajectories. Then, we compute the rates of these processes through Fermi's Golden Rule (FGR) to shed light on the charge separation mechanism, providing a simple rationalisation of the higher experimental efficiency shown by Y6 derivatives with respect to IDIC derivatives in BHJs.17,28–30
Results and discussion
MD simulations are known to lead to molecular packings similar to those under actual conditions,31 and were recently used as a starting point to assign the exceptional performance of Y6 as NFA to its peculiar π–π stacking in the crystal and in thin films.32 It is well established that the D/A morphology has a deep influence on the final PCE,33 and that side chains affect the morphology of the blend, acting on the packing and thus on electronic interactions, allowing to achieve a fine control of transport properties.34–37 While the effect of side chains is neglected in this work, replacing them with methyl groups as common practice even in recent computational studies,32,38–40 we are working to systematically address their role in tuning electronic interactions, which will be the subject of a future publication. Herein, we started our study with the parameterisation of accurate intramolecular QMD-FFs for the molecules of interest: we adopted the Joyce parameterisation protocol,41–43 exploiting a fitting procedure of the QM Hessian obtained at DFT/B3LYP-D3/6-31G(d) level with the Gaussian16 software.44 Despite the extended conjugation in the considered substrates, a certain degree of flexibility should be expected for the rotation around the alternating σ bonds (dihedral angles δ shown in Fig. 1): significant amplitude distortions from the equilibrium positions might take place, hence the harmonic approximation could fail. For each of the dihedrals δ, a relaxed internal energy scan was therefore also performed, by optimising all degrees of freedom except the scanned torsional angle at the same level of theory (B3LYP-D3/6-31G(d)). We report in the ESI (see Sections S2–S4†) an extensive description of the parameterisation procedure and its validation. We completed the description of the molecules for classical MD simulations combining the intramolecular QMD-FFs with Lennard-Jones parameters from appropriate OPLS atom types,45 and point charges fitted following the RESP procedure.46 We made the resulting force fields available to the community in a public GitHub repository. An important point is how the geometry of Y6 affects the electronic couplings. Recently, it was pointed out that Y6's curved structure favours extended π-stacking, leading to strong couplings.32,47 The curved Y6 structure in comparison to IDIC-4Cl is determined by (i) the relative arrangement of peripheral rings in the central IDT (IDIC-4Cl) and TTP-TTI (Y6) cores (ii) the rotation around the δ1 dihedral, adopting an s-cis conformation in IDIC-4Cl, and an s-trans conformation in Y6. QM relaxed scans along this coordinate show a high barrier (≈60 kJ mol−1 for both Y6 and IDIC-4Cl), highlighting a significant double bond character, obviously due to the extended π-conjugation. We underline how our parameterisation is able to capture such a feature (see Fig. S7 and S11†), showing how ad hoc force fields can help to correctly treat the chemistry of these two molecules.
We ran MD simulations for both blends with the Gromacs software,48 randomly arranging 64 donor molecules and 64 acceptor molecules in a cubic box, in line with the experimental ratio.17 Technical details of the simulations are given in the ESI (see Section S1†). To obtain information on the relative spatial arrangement of D and A molecules, we computed the Radial Distribution Function (RDF) between the centres of mass of the rings constituting the π-conjugated systems of D and A (see Fig. 2). From this analysis we observe a first peak slightly above 4 Å, which we assign to π-stacked D/A pairs. Although typical distances for π-stacking are below 4 Å,32,39 D and A rings are likely to show both lateral and/or longitudinal displacements, thus the expected distance between centres of mass should be higher than the typical π-stacking one (see Fig. 2), as observed in our computed RDFs. Since π-stacked pairs are the ones for which the most favourable interactions are expected, we sampled ≈1500 D/A pairs from MD trajectories (see Section S1 in the ESI†), for which we calculated electronic couplings for PET, PHT, CR to ground state, EET from the donor's first singlet excited state to the acceptor's first singlet excited state. In terms of D/A geometrical arrangements, in Fig. 2 we report a 2D distribution of the π-stacking distance (rπ) vs. the distance between the centres of mass of the rings constituting the π-conjugated systems of D and A (rCOMπ), for the 100 D/A pairs giving rise to the strongest electronic couplings, together with the geometries of a few of these pairs. In analogy to what discussed for the RDFs, we see that an rCOMπ slightly above 4 Å corresponds to an rπ slightly below 4 Å, confirming the π-stacking pattern we hypothesised in the analysis of the RDFs.
 Fig. 2  Radial distribution function between the centres of mass of the rings constituting the π-conjugated systems of D and A and π-stacking for D/A pairs with the strongest couplings, with selected examples. 
For PET, PHT, and CR, we computed transfer integrals between frontier orbitals as Jij = 〈ϕi||ϕj〉, where ϕi and ϕj are the unperturbed frontier orbitals of the isolated D and A, respectively, and  is the Fock operator of the D/A pair (see Section S1 in the ESI†).20,49,50 EET couplings have been evaluated resorting to a perturbative approach from the transition densities of the non-interacting units,51–53 as implemented in Gaussian16 (see Section S1 in the ESI†). This computational approach allows estimating both coulombic contribution and short range terms, which could contribute significantly to the excitonic coupling for closely packed pairs.54 All electronic coupling calculations included dielectric effects through the polarisable continuum model (PCM)55 assuming a dielectric constant ε = 4, a commonly used value for bulk materials.56–58 The results are summarised in Table 1. For both ZR1:Y6 and ZR1:IDIC-4Cl, we observe comparable average values of the electronic couplings. However, we see that the ZR1:Y6 pairs give rise to significantly higher maximum couplings for all the processes investigated, in comparison to ZR1:IDIC-4Cl. As we already highlighted, this result is the consequence of the peculiar structure of Y6, as it was suggested elsewhere.32 The observed differences are expected to have a strong influence on the rates, which scale with the square of the electronic coupling, but, since the ZR1:Y6 pair shows systematically higher couplings, this information is not sufficient to explain its higher efficiency. Another typical parameter used to evaluate the performance of acceptors is the reorganisation energy λ.40,59,60 The values reported in Table 1 for Y6 and IDIC-4Cl are in agreement with the ones recently reported for some of the best performing NFAs,40 with Y6 showing systematically lower reorganisation energies for all process investigated in comparison to IDIC-4Cl, suggesting a superior performance as electron acceptor.

In analogy to other works,32,47,61–63 we have evaluated the rates of the processes occurring at the interface for all the extracted D/A pairs. We resorted to Fermi's Golden Rule (FGR), a full quantum mechanical approach whereby the transition rate between two electronic states |i〉 and |j〉 whose energy difference is ΔEij can be expressed as: (1)where Jij is the electronic coupling element and F(ΔEij, T) is the Franck–Condon weighted density of states (FCWD) (see Section S1 in ESI†). FGR represents a significant improvement with respect to the widely used classical Marcus theory, since it allows taking into account tunneling effects and frequency changes between initial and final electronic states, including the whole sets of normal modes in the computation,57,64–67 leading to extremely reliable rates of radiative and non-radiative electronic transitions.67–71 Notably, Marcus theory (see Table S8† in the ESI) leads to significantly underestimated rates for CR with respect to FGR (Table 1), a consequence of the high exergonicity of these processes.72

Table 1 shows that the PET process is fast (≈1012 s−1) for both blends, while the PHT process is significantly slower for ZR1:IDIC-4Cl. This is due to the fact that PHT is energetically disfavoured for this blend, being endergonic. Together with the high rates for EET from donor to acceptor, this indicates that the S1 state of IDIC-4Cl behaves as a trap, lowering the overall efficiency for this blend. On the contrary, ZR1:Y6 shows comparable rates for PET, PHT and EET rates, suggesting that excitons can efficiently dissociate in the CT state through both electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor and through hole transfer from the acceptor to the donor. This difference between Y6 and IDIC-4Cl is of paramount importance, since, as demonstrated in the experimental work,17 both IDIC-4Cl and Y6 provide complementary absorption spectra for ZR1, indicating that a significant portion of the solar spectrum can be exploited. This leads in turn to higher efficiency of the device only if excitons generated in both donor and acceptor domains rapidly dissociate in the CT state. It is clear from this discussion that, for the systems here considered, the different behaviour is mainly related to the differences in the energy level alignment. Therefore, it is important to carefully match energy levels between D and A in a BHJ to aim at the maximum performance. However, once this is achieved, other factors can become dominant, such as the FCWDs and/or the electronic couplings. This implies that, to get a realistic picture of all the contributions to the final performance of the blends, one cannot resort only to isolated molecules calculations: a certain amount of sampling is needed to effectively describe the D/A morphology, and modelling can be accelerated projecting pre-computed properties onto geometries extracted from a sampling procedure (e.g. MD or ad hoc sampling of D/A arrangements).53,54
To gain further insight about the differences between the two blends, we exploited the computed rates of the processes reported in Table 1 to set up a kinetic model for state populations,73 described by the following set of coupled differential equations: (2)where the labels GS, LED, LEA, CT refer, respectively, to the ground state, the locally excited donor, the locally excited acceptor, and the charge transfer state. The matrix of rate constants is built according to the model of electronic states and processes reported in Fig. 1. In Fig. 3 we report the solutions to eqn (2) for both blends, with initial conditions corresponding to a local excitation of the donor (PLED = 1), the most favorable condition for ZR1:IDIC-4Cl, for which kPET ≫ kPHT. We remark that both D and A possess low energy triplet states, which have not been included in the model since they are expected to play only a marginal role, as demonstrated by the low spin–orbit coupling values (see Section S9 in ESI†). As we already speculated when discussing the rates in Table 1, Fig. 3 shows that the most striking difference in the behaviour of the two blends are the much higher population of the CT state reached in few picoseconds in the ZR1:Y6 blend, and the long lifetime of the LEA state in the ZR1:IDIC-4Cl blend, which thus acts as a trap state.
 Fig. 3  Electronic states population dynamics evolved according to eqn (2) for ZR1:Y6 (top) and ZR1:IDIC-4Cl (bottom). We assumed a binding energy of 0.1 eV, as suggested in ref. 9 and 28. 
Another difference between the systems under study is that CR is faster for ZR1:IDIC-4Cl than for ZR1:Y6. Such behavior can be traced back to the different shapes of the predicted FCWDs for the two processes, reported in Fig. 4: the FCWD for CR in ZR1:IDIC-4Cl is broader and peaked at larger ΔE values than that in ZR1:Y6, ultimately leading to higher rates for the highly exergonic (see Table 1) CR process.

We have then considered the final step towards photocurrent generation, i.e. charge migration towards the electrodes by pure diffusion inside the micro-crystalline donor and acceptor domains. The figure of merit describing the efficiency of this process is the charge mobility, which we have evaluated applying the Einstein model to the crystal structures of these molecules retrieved from the Cambridge Structural Database74 (see Section S1 in the ESI†). It has been pointed out that, possibly, neither band transport nor hopping theory correctly describe the physics beyond charge transport in ultrapure organic crystals.19,75,76 Nevertheless, since it has been shown that hopping models, in particular when quantum mechanical effects are included (such as in FGR), lead to mobilities in line with experimental data, at least at room temperature69,77,78 (see also Section S11 in the ESI† for a deeper discussion about this point), for consistency we decided to resort to the same (hopping) theoretical framework used for the other processes taking place at the D/A interface in the BHJ. We remark that this model should be used with caution for systems showing a quasi-1D charge transport,79 which, however, is not the case for the molecules under study (see also Table S9†).
Our results show that ZR1 (hole mobility μh = 0.44 cm2 V−1 s−1), Y6 (electron mobility μe = 4.55 cm2 V−1 s−1), and IDIC-4Cl (μe = 9.85 cm2 V−1 s−1) all possess a quite high mobility, a fundamental requirement towards an efficient photocurrent generation in OSCs. In particular, the values for Y6 and IDIC-4Cl are similar to top reports for n-type semiconductors, which are receiving a growing attention from the research community,80 since the vast majority of these materials display lower carrier mobility and air stability than p-type semiconductors. It should be noted that our predicted mobilities are significantly higher than the experimental values obtained performing SCLC measurements on films of these blends (μ ≈ 10−4 for all the molecules under study17). This is probably due to the fact that (i) D and A domains in BHJs are not entirely crystalline and (ii) experimental samples inevitably present disorder, grain boundaries and other defects that significantly affect the mobility.77,81 Indeed, significantly higher experimental mobilities have been reported,82e.g. for purified single-crystal transistors of Y6 (μe ≈ 2 cm2 V−1 s−1), in better agreement with our results. Our predicted values should thus be intended as an upper limit for this class of materials, which could be achieved e.g. through thermal annealing of the blend, leading to stronger crystallinity and a more ordered morphology.17 Another factor that could explain the different experimental mobility is polymorphism, i.e. the ability of accessing different solid state packing structures even at room temperature, a common occurrence for organic materials.83 Since even the slightest change in molecular packing can have a huge impact on electronic properties,84–87 significantly different results can be obtained even when resorting to the same experimental setup.88,89 As an example, we have studied a different polymorph of Y6, reported in ref. 90, obtaining μe = 7.59 cm2 V−1 s−1, quite different than the value we obtained for the polymorph discussed above (reported in ref. 82).
Conclusions and outlook
In this work we have computationally characterised in detail two all-small-molecule BHJs that recently appeared in the literature based on highly efficient non-fullerene acceptors, namely ZR1:Y6, and ZR1:IDIC-4Cl.
We modelled the morphology of the blends thanks to classical MD simulations, adopting accurate force fields parameterised on QM reference data and computed electronic couplings for various processes occurring at the interface on a statistically relevant ensemble of D/A pairs extracted from MD snapshots. We evaluated the rates of these processes resorting to Fermi's Golden Rule, which represents a significant advancement with respect to the widely used semi-classical Marcus-derived approaches. Finally, we used the rates in a simple kinetic model to follow the evolution of populations of electronic states involved in the processes that lead to charge separation. This unique combination of state-of-the-art computational methods allowed us to propose a simple rationalisation of the great performance of Y6 as acceptor, in comparison to other widely used ones, such as IDIC derivatives: we found that the CT state for ZR1:Y6 can be accessed both via hole and electron transfer pathways, while this is not the case when the acceptor is IDIC-4Cl. We identified the reasons of the lower performance of IDIC-4Cl in the trap state behaviour of its first excited state, together with a fast charge recombination rate.
Since donors and NFAs can have complementary absorption spectra, this study highlights that having multiple pathways for charge separation is fundamental in new-generation solar cells able to exploit more efficiently the solar spectrum.
The natural continuation of this work resides in expanding the range of organic molecules studied, however there are some issues that should be addressed to cover more cases. Indeed, while several small-molecule non-fullerene acceptors have been reported in the literature, they have been mostly used in combination with polymeric donors, and the methods presented herein are currently limited to small molecules because of the QMD-FFs parameterisation and of the electronic structure. However, extensions of the parameterisation procedure to polymers can be readily implemented,91 and their electronic structure can be evaluated from frontier orbitals of the monomers,92 making the applicability of the methods presented in this work to other systems a realistic objective on the short term.
