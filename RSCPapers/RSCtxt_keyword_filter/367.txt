    , Accepted 26th November 2013First published on 27th November 2013AbstractThe phase formation, morphology evolution and bandgap of Sn1−xSbxSe (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.6) nanocrystals synthesized at 230–275 °C for 5–36 h in a one-pot system were studied. Sn2+ is kinetically more reactive than Sb3+ toward Se2−. The SnSe(1) phase (JCPDS 01-075-6133) grew in the Sn1−xSbxSe (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) nanocrystals, while the SnSe(2) phase (JCPDS 32-1382) was dominant in the Sn1−xSbxSe (0.3 ≤ x ≤ 0.6) nanocrystals. In the present study, the substitution solubility of Sb in the SnSe lattice is about 10 at%. The introduction of more Sb in the Sn1−xSbxSe (0.3 ≤ x ≤ 0.6) nanocrystals induced more defects therein and thus caused the phase transformation from SnSe(1) to SnSe(2). The SnSe nanocrystals grew as nanosheets, while the introduction of Sb enhanced the growth of Sn1−xSbxSe nanorods. The direct and indirect bandgaps of the Sn1−xSbxSe (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) nanocrystals could be tuned from 1.39 to 1.53 eV and 0.93 to 1.28 eV, respectively, by increasing the Sb concentration (x) from 0 to 0.2. The tunable morphology and bandgap of the Sn1−xSbxSe nanocrystals make them potential candidates as photovoltaic materials.
Introduction
SnSe is a native p-type semiconductor with indirect and direct bandgaps of 0.9 and 1.3 eV, respectively. Similar to SnS, SnSe is a promising alternative to lead chalcogenides in photovoltaic (PV) applications because of its environmental sustainability. To maximize the conversion efficiency, the bandgap of an ideal PV absorber layer should be around 1.3 eV for the single-junction cell and 1.0–1.9 eV for the two-junction cell.1,2 These requirements can be achieved by tuning the bandgaps of PV materials via adjusting their size or chemical compositions.3–12 It is difficult to tune the bandgaps of SnSe and SnS nanocrystals through control of the nanocrystal's size within the quantum confined regime because of their layered crystal structure which readily results in the formation of a sheet-like morphology instead of 0-dimensional particles.9,10,13,14 Therefore, studies about the bandgap control of SnSe and SnS by modulating their chemical compositions are vital.
Recently, a few studies about the tunable bandgaps of SnSxSe1−x (ref. 12) and SnxGe1−xSe15 nanocrystals synthesized by a hot-injection method have been reported. However studies for the synthesis of SnSe nanocrystals alloyed with other cations via a simple route still remain to be explored. The ion radius of Sb3+, 0.076 nm, is close to that, of Sn2+ (0.093 nm).16 It is anticipated that the substitution of Sb for Sn in SnSe would widen the bandgap of SnSe according to the Burstein–Moss effect17–19 because Sb has five valence electrons which is one valence electron more than Sn. The synthesis of Sn1−xSbxSe nanocrystals is not reported yet. In this work, we have synthesized Sn1−xSbxSe (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.6) nanocrystals in a one-pot system via a solution-phase process and explored the effects of Sb on the phase transformation, morphology evolution and tunable bandgap of Sn1−xSbxSe nanocrystals. The results reveal that the Sn1−xSbxSe (0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) nanocrystals with a tunable morphology and bandgap are potential candidates as photovoltaic materials.
Experimental
The mixture of Se (1 mmol), SnCl2·2H2O (1 − x mmol) and Sb(CH3COO)3 (x mmol) powders with x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 and 0.6, and 30 ml of oleylamine was stirred for 2 h and then poured into a two-neck flask, respectively. Undoped SnSe and the Sn0.9Sb0.1Se, Sn0.8Sb0.2Se, Sn0.7Sb0.3Se, and Sn0.6Sb0.4Se samples were synthesized in N2 at 230 °C for 10 h, 260 °C for 10 h, 270 °C for 20 h, and 270 °C for 24 h, respectively, to acquire the single SnSe phase, while the Sn1−xSbxSe (0.5 ≤ x ≤ 0.6) samples were synthesized in N2 at 275 °C for 24 h, followed by a slow cooling to room temperature. The reaction products were sequentially washed in hexane (10 ml) and ethanol (10 ml). For each wash, the dissoluble by-product was separated by centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 3 min. The whole process was repeated five times. Finally, the powder was dried at about 45 °C.
The microstructure of the samples was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Zeiss Auriga 35–50) operating at 5 kV, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEOL JEM-2100F) operating at 200 kV. The samples for TEM were prepared by dispersing the nanocrystals in ethanol, and then the dispersion was dropped on carbon–copper grids. The chemical compositions of the samples were measured with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) (Bruker QUANTAX200/SEM and Oxford XMX1058/TEM). The phases in the samples were analyzed using a Rigaku MultiFlex X-ray diffractometer (XRD) with Ni-filtered CuKα radiation. The optical properties of the samples were characterized using diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectroscopy (Hitachi, U-4100) with the scanning speed of 300 nm min−1 in the range of 400–2000 nm. The valence states of the chemical elements in the samples were measured using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (PHI 5000 Versaprobe) with monochromatic Al Kα as the X-ray source.
Results and discussion
For the undoped SnSe samples, the single SnSe (JCPDS 01-075-6133) phase, orthorhombic with a = 1.1501, b = 0.4153, and c = 0.4445 nm, hereafter referred to as SnSe(1), could be synthesized at 230 °C for 10 h as shown in Fig. 1. The temperature for the growth of the single SnSe(1) phase in the Sn1−xSbxSe (0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) samples increased with the amount of Sb. Meanwhile, the XRD peaks of the Sn1−xSbxSe (0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) samples shift to higher diffraction angles relative to that of the SnSe sample, respectively, with the extent increasing with the amount of Sb, revealing that Sb3+ substitutes for Sn2+ in the Sn1−xSbxSe (0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) lattice. The lattice constants of the SnSe, Sn0.9Sb0.1Se, and Sn0.8Sb0.2Se alloys calculated from their XRD patterns are a = 1.1496, 1.1454, and 1.1288 nm, b = 0.4152, 0.4142, and 0.4120 nm, and c = 0.4428, 0.4385, and 0.4344 nm, correspondingly. From the XPS analyses, the binding energy of Sb3d5/2 (530.0 eV) in the Sn0.9Sb0.1Se and Sn0.8Sb0.2Se samples was close to the reported value of Sb3+. One example is shown in Fig. 2. The difference in the ion radius between Sb3+, 0.076 nm, and Sn2+, 0.093 nm, is about 18%.16 This mismatch is somewhat larger than the criterion for substitution solubility noted by Hume-Rothery who pointed out that an extensive solid solubility of one metal in another only occurs if the diameters of the metals differ by less than 15%.20 A similar result for the SnxGe1−xSe alloy was also reported,15 where the difference in the ion radius between Ge2+, 0.073 nm, and Sn2+, 0.093 nm, is about 21%.

In contrast to the Sn0.9Sb0.1Se and Sn0.8Sb0.2Se samples, the XRD peaks of the Sn1−xSbxSe (0.3 ≤ x ≤ 0.6) samples shift to lower diffraction angles relative to those of the SnSe sample as shown in Fig. 3, and thus they can be assigned as another SnSe phase (JCPDS 32-1382), orthorhombic with a = 1.142, b = 0.419, and c = 0.446 nm, hereafter referred to as SnSe(2). The cell volume of SnSe(2), 213.41 Ǻ3, is larger than that, of SnSe(1) (212.31 Ǻ3). It is worth noting that there may be a little amount SnSe(1) in the Sn1−xSbxSe (0.3 ≤ x ≤ 0.6) samples. For the Sn1−xSbxSe (0.5 ≤ x ≤ 0.6) samples synthesized at 275 °C for 24 h, which is very close to the decomposition temperature, 278.6 °C, of oleylamine,21 other phases such as Sb and Sb2Se3 were observed. In addition, there is no significant shift between the corresponding XRD peaks for the Sn1−xSbxSe (0.3 ≤ x ≤ 0.6) samples. These results reveal that there exists a limit in the substitution solubility of Sb in the SnSe lattice. Table 1 shows the real chemical compositions of the Sn1−xSbxSe (0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) nanocrystals, from the EDS/SEM analyses. In the present study, the substitution solubility of Sb in the SnSe lattice is about 10 at%.

For the Sn0.4Sb0.6Se samples synthesized at 275 °C for 24 h, Sb and Sb2Se3 impurities also appeared.

In order to clarify the factors responsible for the phase transformation from SnSe(1) to SnSe(2), both the Sn0.8Sb0.2Se and Sn0.7Sb0.3Se samples were synthesized under the same conditions, i.e., at 250 °C for 36 h. The XRD patterns in Fig. 4 show that the single SnSe(1) phase grew in the Sn0.8Sb0.2Se sample, while SnSe(2) grew in the Sn0.7Sb0.3Se sample, where little SnSe(1) was possibly present. Furthermore, the same result still occurred in the Sn0.8Sb0.2Se and Sn0.7Sb0.3Se samples synthesized at 260 °C for 10 h and 270 °C for 20 h, respectively. These data reveal that the phase transformation from SnSe(1) to SnSe(2) is due to the introduction of more Sb and is independent of the synthesis temperature.

As seen in Fig. 3, the diffraction peaks become more and more broad when increasing the amount of Sb, indicating that the introduction of Sb induces some defects in the crystals. From the condition for electroneutrality, the introduction of two SbSn+ can induce the formation of one VSn2−, i.e., a Sn vacancy, and thus the [VSn2−] increases with the [SbSn+]. When the amount of added Sb exceeds the limit of substitution solubility, the extra Sb can form other defects such as interstitial solute atoms which may play an important role in the phase transformation from SnSe(1) to SnSe(2) for the Sn1−xSbxSe (0.3 ≤ x ≤ 0.6) samples.
As shown in Fig. 1 and 3, the temperature and time for the growth of the single SnSe phase in the Sn1−xSbxSe (0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) samples increased with the amount of Sb. For the Sn0.8Sb0.2Se sample synthesized at 250 °C for 10 h and the Sn1−xSbxSe (0.5 ≤ x ≤ 0.6) samples synthesized at 275 °C for 24 h other phases such as Sb and Sb2Se3 were also observed, respectively. In order to compare the reactivity between Sn2+ and Se2− with that between Sb3+ and Se2−, Sn-rich Sn0.9Sb0.1Se and Sb-rich Sb1.8Sn0.2Se3 with the same cation ratio, 9:1, and Sb2Se3 samples were synthesized at 230 °C for 10 h. The pure single SnSe(1) phase was acquired for the Sn0.9Sb0.1Se sample as shown in Fig. 1. However, for the Sb1.8Sn0.2Se3 sample the Sb2Se3 phase (JCPDS 01-072-1184) coexisted with the residual Sb (JCPDS 00-035-0732) as shown in Fig. 5. The XRD peaks of Sb1.8Sn0.2Se3 shift to lower diffraction angles relative to those of Sb2Se3, indicating that Sn2+ indeed substitutes for Sb3+ in the Sb2Se3 lattice. These results reveal that Sn2+ is kinetically more reactive than Sb3+ toward Se2−. The detailed mechanism for the formation of the Sn1−xSbxSe nanocrystals remains to be further studied.

The SnSe crystals formed with the morphology of a nanosheet with about 50 nm in thickness, while the introduction of Sb enhanced the growth of the Sn1−xSbxSe nanorods as seen in Fig. 6. The nanosheets were [100]-oriented with the (020) and (002) facets, while the nanorods grew along the [010] direction as seen in Fig. 7 and 8, respectively. The EDS/TEM line scans for the Sn1−xSbxSe (0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) nanostructures in Fig. 9 show the uniform distribution of Sn, Sb and Se. Similar to the nanowires, the nanostructures with a rod morphology would increase the power conversion efficiency in the photovoltaic devices because they can offer continuous charge carrier transport pathways, and the nanoscale grain boundaries prevent charge carrier recombination.22–25

The direct and indirect bandgaps of the Sn1−xSbxSe(0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) nanocrystals increased from 1.39 to 1.58 eV and 0.93 to 1.28 eV with increasing the amount of Sb, respectively, as shown in Fig. 10, which were obtained from their reflectance spectra by performing Kubelka–Munk transformations.26,27 The widening bandgap of the Sn1−xSbxSe nanocrystals is due to the Burstein–Moss effect.17–19 The tunable bandgap of the Sn1−xSbxSe (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) nanocrystals overlaps well with the solar spectrum, making them attractive candidates for the absorption layer in efficient solar cells.

Conclusions
Sn1−xSbxSe (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.6) nanocrystals were synthesized at 230–275 °C in a one-pot system via a solution-phase process. Sn2+ is kinetically more reactive than Sb3+ toward Se2−. The substitution solubility of Sb in the SnSe lattice is about 10 at%. SnSe(1) grew in the Sn1−xSbxSe (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) samples, while SnSe(2) was dominant in the Sn1−xSbxSe (0.3 ≤ x ≤ 0.6) samples. The introduction of more Sb in the Sn1−xSbxSe (0.3 ≤ x ≤ 0.6) samples caused the phase transformation from SnSe(1) to SnSe(2). The introduction of Sb enhanced the growth of the Sn1−xSbxSe nanorods. The direct and indirect bandgaps of the Sn1−xSbxSe nanocrystals could be tuned from 1.39 to 1.53 eV and 0.93 to 1.28 eV, respectively, by increasing the Sb concentration (x) from 0 to 0.2.
