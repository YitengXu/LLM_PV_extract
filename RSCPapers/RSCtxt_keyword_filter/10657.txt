    , Accepted 18th May 2021First published on 20th May 2021AbstractOur work analyses for the first time the kinetics of perovskite/organic photovoltaic (OPV) interfaces with different perovskite I/Br ratios (MAPbI3−xBrx, x = 0, 1, 2, and 3) and PM6:Y6 as a bulk heterojunction blend. The aim was to study in depth the combination of a wide band gap perovskite material – that allows large open-circuit voltage – and the PM6:Y6 thin film that accounts for large photocurrents in organic photovoltaics (OPV). Studies of carrier extraction and carrier recombination kinetics, using time resolved spectroscopy under operando conditions, have been performed to understand the charge dynamics in these cells. Comprehension of the processes in this perovskite solar cell configuration allowed us to foresee important differences in the reorganization of the perovskite internal electric field depending on its composition and how the performance is influenced by different degrees of accumulation of electronic charges at selective contacts.
Introduction
Hybrid perovskite ionic semiconductors represent a recent success for the development of efficient solar cells. Simple fabrication processes, a high absorption coefficient, a long charge-carrier diffusion length, a tunable bandgap and low exciton binding energy make them optimal candidates to overpass silicon solar cells and approach GaAs devices.1,2 The maximum achievable power conversion efficiencies of perovskites have now surpassed 25%.3 However, the onset absorption edge of perovskites in most perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is usually ≈800 nm, which hinders the utilization of infrared (IR) radiation, resulting in significant solar radiation losses.4,5 Therefore, several efforts have been made to find efficient strategies of further extending the absorption of PSCs without compromising the open circuit voltage (Voc) output. Bromide-based perovskite solar cells (MAPbBr3) attract much attention because of their bandgap of 2.3 eV that can be further modulated to a lower value by doping with iodide, and provide a considerably high Voc when applied in devices. Moreover, they are relatively stable compared to MAPbI3 due to their higher binding energy and the smaller Bohr radius of bromide.2,4–8 However, investigations on achieving such a high operating voltage with sufficient output power still remain a challenge for bromide-based perovskite solar cells, and further research is required on carrier losses under operation conditions of these devices.
On the other hand, recent published examples of the combination of perovskites with bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells have allowed us to broaden the solar cell absorption spectrum of the corresponding single devices.9–19 However, interfacial reactions in these devices have not been explored in depth.
Conjugated small molecules and polymers have been widely used as light absorbers in BHJ organic solar cells that have exhibited high performance. BHJ-OPV devices over 17% efficiencies under standard irradiation conditions have been recently reported.20 Intimate contact between donor and acceptor molecules in a blended film facilitates efficient charge generation, and the formation of percolation paths for electrons and holes allows for efficient carrier extraction from the bulk film to the selective contact electrodes.21–24 Moreover, the BHJ layer can be directly spin-coated onto the perovskite layer using orthogonal solvents to greatly simplify the fabrication process. For instance, Yang et al. used a small molecule DOR3T-TBDT as the donor in the BHJ film and achieved improved power conversion efficiency (14.3%) in the integrated MAPbI3−xClx/BHJ device.14 K. Gao and co-workers optimized the MAPbI3/BHJ integrated device after which it exhibited higher fill factors (0.78).11 Zhan and co-workers reported integrated MAPbI3−xClx/BHJ devices that showed an ultrahigh photocurrent (28.2 mA cm−2) and an extended photovoltaic response up to 1000 nm.17
Herein, we studied integrated MAPbI3−xBrx/PM6:Y6 (BHJ) devices (see Scheme 1). Different I/Br ratios were used in the MAPbI3−xBrx (x = 0, 1, 2, 3) device composition to tune the perovskite energy levels (valence band and conduction band, VB and CB, respectively) and facilitate interfacial energy and charge transfer between the perovskite and the OPV layers (see Fig. 1). All the HOMO/LUMO levels were obtained from previous papers.4,6,21 Moreover, studies of charge (ionic and electronic) extraction and carrier recombination kinetics have been performed for the first time on OPV integrated wide band gap PSCs. Our results show that improvements in solar radiation to energy conversion efficiency are possible and, thus, the integration of organic solar cells in perovskite solar cells should be regarded as a serious possibility to enhance the efficiency of these devices.

Results and discussion
Device fabrication details are described in the Experimental section in the ESI.† All the perovskite compositions were combined with the PM6:Y6 BHJ to prepare devices. As a reference, we fabricated perovskite solar cells using the standard spiro-OMeTAD layer as a hole transport material (HTM). First, we prepared different perovskite compositions of MAPbI3−xBrx (x = 0, 1, 2, 3), see the ESI, for structural characterization by the XRD technique. As can be seen in Fig. S1,† all the patterns showed the main peaks that are assigned to the different perovskite structures in agreement with those reported in the literature.25,26 Photographs of the prepared perovskite films with their distinctive colour are shown in Fig. S2,† whereas cross sectional images of the complete devices were obtained by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, see Fig. S3†). From these images, a thickness of about 400 nm for the perovskite layer and 200 nm thickness for the spiro-OMeTAD and OPV layers were estimated. FESEM-EDX (energy dispersive X-ray analysis) was used to determine the I/Br weight% in the mixed perovskite composition (see Table S1†). The results confirmed the greater weight% of iodine in MAPbI2Br and greater weight% of bromine in MAPbIBr2.
Study of the J–V curves and EQE
The performance of the devices was estimated by measuring the J–V curves under standard measurement conditions, the most relevant parameters are listed in Table 1 (Fig. 2, 3 and 4 show the J–V curves of the best devices, whereas Table S2† compiles the average values obtained from eight devices). Importantly, we would like to highlight that the effect of the integrated OPV layer on top of the perovskite layer has a different influence depending on the I/Br halogen ratio. In comparison with the reference devices, the full bromine perovskite (MAPbBr3) with OPV, showed slightly lower efficiencies, mainly due to a decrease in FF. However, with the introduction of iodine in the perovskite composition, a positive effect on the OPV system is clearly observed, mainly attributed to the increase in the Jsc parameter, resulting in increased Jsc by about 200% for MAPbIBr2, 121% for MAPbI2Br and 119% for MAPbI3 devices.

 Fig. 2  
J–V curves for the MAPbBr3 devices under standard illumination conditions. 
Considering the OPV as a selective functional solar cell, the electrons generated from the separated exciton at the donor–acceptor interface in the PM6:Y6 layer can be transported through the electron acceptor material (Y6) to the perovskite material, which here acts as both a light absorber and an electron transporting layer, and finally be collected at the TiO2/FTO cathode. It is important to mention, that the energy levels from the literature are valid as starting points but the HOMO–LUMO values can differ significantly when the organic semiconductor molecule is deposited on top of the perovskite semiconductor material.27 As can be seen from the EQE spectra, depending on the perovskite compositions, electrons from the OPV BHJ can be collected (here, OPV works as a functional solar cell) or blocked (here, OPV works as a hole transporting layer). Taking this hypothesis into account, the higher energy of the MAPbBr3 CB blocks the efficient collection of electrons, while holes can still be collected at the metal contact. This effect can be experimentally observed from the J–V curves. Fig. 2 shows the comparison between MAPbBr3 devices prepared with the selective spiro-OMeTAD contact and the OPV-BHJ.
“S” shaped J–V curves previously reported for organic solar cells were due to the accumulation of one type of carrier (electrons or holes) leading to an unbalanced extraction and, thus, a negative effect on the device fill factor.28 Therefore, we assign the S-shape to the misalignment of the energy levels for electron collection. This effect is also observed for MAPbI3 solar cells (Fig. 3).
 Fig. 3  
J–V curves for the MAPbI3 devices under standard illumination conditions. 
In the particular case of MAPbI3 solar cells, however, the contribution of the OPV to the solar cell photocurrent is noticeable and photocurrents as high as 25 mA cm−2 are recorded. Thus, between the two different perovskite materials, it is clear that one type of carrier is favoured for extraction over the other due to the different energy alignments. While it is difficult to efficiently extract electrons in the MAPbBr3/PM6:Y6 devices due to the ΔECB-LUMO between the perovskite CB and the LUMO of the organic material (0.25 eV), this is not the case in the MAPbI3/PM6:Y6 solar cells where the ΔECB-LUMO is 0.05 eV. In contrast, the MAPbBr3/PM6:Y6 devices are able to extract electronic holes much more efficiently than their counterpart MAPbI3/PM6:Y6. Interestingly, in both cases the Voc is reduced although with a more pronounced effect on the MAPbI3/PM6:Y6 solar cells (ca. 100 mV).
When mixed halide perovskites are used, namely MAPbI2Br and MAPbIBr2, the “S” shape of the J–V curves (Fig. 4) is not observed.
 Fig. 4  (Top) J–V curves for MAPbI2Br and (bottom) the J–V curves for the MAPbIBr2 solar cells. 
In both cases, the energy band alignment has been improved, allowing better balance in carrier extraction. Nonetheless, for MAPbIBr2 the positive effect of the OPV is more pronounced. Both, the photocurrent and Voc are improved. In fact, for these two types of perovskites, the use of the PM6:Y6 OPV as a selective contact remarkably decreases the hysteresis effect observed for the standard devices. In both types of solar cells the photocurrent is reasonably increased due to the OPV contribution, which is in good agreement with the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra shown in Fig. 5.
 Fig. 5  EQE curves of MAPbI3−xBrx/spiro-OMeTAD, MAPbI3−xBrx/OPV and PM6:Y6. The shaded part indicates the OPV contribution to the device EQE in comparison to the contribution of spiro-OMeTAD. 
EQE studies were carried out in order to corroborate the improvement of the Jsc cell parameters as well as the UV-Visible absorption measurements of the films (see Fig. S4†). As expected, PM6:Y6 OPV devices showed panchromatic absorption from 300 nm to 950 nm. The UV-vis absorption spectra show that the absorption range is increased towards the NIR in all cases when PM6:Y6 is added. However, the addition of the BHJ contributes differently to the EQE of the integrated perovskite/OPV devices. To emphasize the OPV contribution to the device photocurrent we have shaded the part of the EQE curve that corresponds to the OPV. For MAPbI2Br and MAPbI3 devices, the EQE augments and the wavelength contribution is extended to the near infrared part of the spectrum, but for MAPbBr2I (almost negligible towards the NIR) and MAPbBr3 the EQE augments only in the visible part.
The energy levels offsets of the different perovskite materials and the materials that are used for the OPV, as reported in the literature, are shown in Fig. 1. As previously reported,4 the introduction of iodine in the MAPbBr3 perovskite narrows the perovskite band gap and allows a better energy alignment match between both the perovskite and the BHJ layers. We can already infer thus, that, for the MAPbBr3 perovskite devices, the OPV contribution has a lower effect due to the higher mismatch between the energy levels offsets.
Study of the charge extraction
After measurements of the EQE and J–V curves we focussed on the kinetics of charge extraction (CE) for the perovskite-based devices. The CE technique has been detailed elsewhere.29 In brief, the technique allows us to measure the charge at different light bias (solar cell photovoltage) and thus, compare devices at the same photovoltage (not at the same light intensity as different devices may have different voltages at the same light power output). Fig. 6 shows the results for the perovskite solar cells using spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM.
 Fig. 6  Carrier density vs. voltage for the different perovskite solar cells. The filled symbols indicate those without geometrical capacitance subtraction. The solid lines correspond to the carrier density after subtraction of the geometrical capacitance. 
As expected, MAPbI3 shows a higher carrier density at the same voltage due to its small bandgap that consequently absorbs more light of the 1.5 AMG sun-simulated spectrum. Interestingly, when the CE technique is applied to the same perovskite material but using the PM6:Y6 OPV as the HTM, the results are quite different (Fig. 7).
 Fig. 7  Carrier density vs. voltage for the different perovskite solar cells using PM6:Y6 OPV as the HTM. The filled symbols indicate those without geometrical capacitance subtraction. The solid lines correspond to the carrier density after subtraction of the geometrical capacitance. 
As shown in Fig. 7, the MAPbI3, MAPbI2Br and MAPbIBr2 perovskite devices appear to have, within the measurement error, similar carrier densities. However, after subtraction of the geometrical capacitance, only MAPbI3 and MAPbI2Br possess a similar number of charges despite the differences in the material absorption, which compared to the inference from Fig. 6 implies that PM6:Y6 OPV is capable of extracting more charges and contributing to the device photocurrent, in perfect agreement with the inference from Fig. 2.
A significant aspect observed from Fig. 7 is the difference in the geometric (at low Voc) and chemical capacitances (at high Voc). For both MAPbI3 and MAPbI2Br, the chemical capacitance is rather high in comparison to those of the other two perovskite compositions. This higher chemical capacitance can be attributed to the accumulation of charges in the perovskite bulk coming from the OPV layer. In fact, a direct comparison for MAPbI3 using either spiro-OMeTAD or PM6:Y6 as the HTM (Fig. 8) clearly shows this difference in the geometric and chemical capacitance contributions.

Study of the carrier recombination kinetics
To study the interfacial carrier recombination processes we have used the TPV (transient photovoltage) technique, which has been already described by our group and others.29–31 First, we have monitored the changes in decay lifetimes upon light bias (device photovoltage upon different light irradiation intensities). Fig. 9 shows the differences between MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3.
 Fig. 9  Normalized transient photovoltage decays at different light irradiation intensities for MAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD (A), MAPbI2Br/spiro-OMeTAD (B), MAPbIBr2/spiro-OMeTAD (C), and MAPbBr3/spiro-OMeTAD (D). 
As it is seen at first sight, the TPV decays under one sun illumination for MAPbI3 based solar cells are much faster (1.2 μs, 1.03 V) when compared to those of MAPbBr3 under one sun illumination (1.7 μs, 1.42 V). Nevertheless, it is important to compare the τ for the recombination decay at the same charge and not at the same illumination intensity. It may well be that identical light irradiation leads to different n (carrier densities) at the device. Fig. 10 shows the carrier density vs carrier lifetime for all perovskite solar cells synthesised in this work with spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM .
 Fig. 10  Carrier density (n) measured using CE vs. carrier lifetime measured using TPV for all the different perovskite materials with spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM in complete solar cells. 
If we observe the region at higher n (for instance 10−7 C cm−2), interfacial carrier recombination occurrs much faster for MAPbBr3 (30 microseconds) in clear contrast with that for MAPbI3 (3 milliseconds). In fact, the introduction of iodine in the perovskite material not only shifts the CB (thermodynamics) but also changes the decay kinetics.
Once the solar cells using spiro-OMeTAD were studied, we focussed on the solar cells using the OPV as the selective contact. The most striking observation was the presence of a negative signal (growth transient profile) at higher light irradiation intensities (1 sun) that changes to a decay signal at lower light irradiation intensities for MAPbI3/OPV solar cells.
Such behaviour is less pronounced when decreasing the amount of iodine in the perovskite material, as can be seen in Fig. 11. Our hypothesis is that at higher light intensities the spectroscopic signal is the experimental observation of the combination of the carrier recombination processes of the organic solar cell (the fastest part of the growth signal) and the perovskite solar cell (the slowest part of the negative transient). In simpler words, for MAPbI3/OPV the PM6:Y6 OPV hetero-junction blend works as a photoactive solar cell.
 Fig. 11  The TPV decays at different light intensities for combined perovskite/OPV solar cells with different I/Br ratio compositions: MAPbI3 (a), MAPbI2Br (b), MAPbIBr2 (c) and MAPbBr3 (d). 
The “negative transient” observation has been previously observed for MAPbI3 solar cells by Pockett et al., Calado and collaborators and by our group29,32,33 and explained as the spectroscopic feature linked to the reorganization of the internal electric field of the perovskite after the creation of free carriers (see Fig. S5 and S6† for further details) but, as far as we know, has never been previously studied for perovskite/OPV solar cells under operando conditions.
As shown in Fig. 11(a), when the light intensity decreases, the transient profile becomes a typical decay with a quasi mono-exponential τ value that we assign to the recombination of carriers at the perovskite (laser pulse intensity generates negligible carriers at the OPV layer).
To prove further our hypothesis, we measured the different TPV transient profiles of the perovskite containing bromide. As illustrated in Fig. 11(b)–(d), the growth transient profile is severely affected by the presence of bromide. In fact, the MAPbBr3/OPV solar cells do not show a multi-exponential growth profile, which can only be due to the difference in the energy level of the perovskite CB (conduction band) which is higher in energy than the LUMO level of the PM6 molecule at the OPV hetero-junction blend (as illustrated in Fig. S7†) and thus, electrons cannot be collected by TiO2, which is in perfect agreement with the EQE data presented in Fig. 5 above. Hence, for the wide band-gap MAPbBr3 the PM6:Y6 OPV film only acts as a selective contact for holes and not as a solar cell that could provide extra photocurrent to the perovskite solar cell while maintaining the high solar cell Voc.
Finally, photoluminescence (PL) emission and PL decays have been measured to compare recombination obtained by using transient (results presented above) and steady-state techniques. Fig. S8(A–D) and S9(A–D)† show the PL emission spectra and PL decays for all the perovskites, without HTMs, with OPV, and with spiro-OMeTAD layers on top. First of all, for MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 with OPV, the PL emission intensity (see Fig. S8A and D†) is higher in comparison to those of the two PSCs with spiro-OMeTAD and without HTMs, indicating the higher charge recombination. These results agree well with the cell performances, because even if they exhibit a higher current density, the final PCE decreases significantly. In contrast, PL emission spectra of MAPbI2Br and MAPbIBr2 with OPV show considerable quenching of the PL emission intensity, what explains the more positive effect of the OPV for these two perovskite in the device performance. The PL decays agreed well with the PL emission spectra.
Conclusions
In this work, we have synthesised and characterized different hybrid perovskite materials with different band-gaps. These perovskite materials have been used in functional solar cells using both, an organic semiconductor such as spiro-OMeTAD and a functional organic solar cell made using the heterojunction PM6:Y6 that has been previously reported as an outstanding OPV device. After full characterization of the solar cells, including J–V curves and the EQE spectra, we have measured the total charge (n) at different light intensities for all the solar cells and, moreover, correlated the n with the different carrier recombination lifetimes using CE and TPV techniques, respectively. Importantly, we have observed remarkable differences in the transient kinetics between MAPbI3/OPV and the MAPbBr3/OPV, which allowed us to distinguish when the OPV film was working as a functional solar cell, by estimating the interfacial process at the OPV, and when the OPV film worked as a selective contact for electronic holes.
These results illustrate the importance of the fine tuning of energy levels between the hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite material and the OPV and, moreover, the need to better understand the additional interfacial charge transfer processes and potential electric field arrangements at the different interfaces of the different layers present in such solar cells. Although our results show that the photocurrent of perovskite solar cells can be further improved using OPV films as selective contacts, much work must is yet to be done to achieve the desired combination of high photocurrent and high voltage for solar cells. Additional work is under way in this direction using MAPbBr3 with different OPV films.
