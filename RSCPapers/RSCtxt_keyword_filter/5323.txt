    , Accepted 6th April 2018First published on 25th April 2018AbstractLuminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) are luminescent waveguide layers that convert sunlight into specific wavelengths which are then guided by total internal reflection to a PV device located at the edges of the LSC. Their ability to concentrate sunlight onto small areas makes LSCs a useful complement to silicon-based PVs in a series of applications, such as urban integration and flexible fabrics towards mobile solar-energy. Challenges for the luminescent layer include the use of low-cost and sustainable nature-based organic molecules. We report novel chlorophyll-based LSCs with emission properties in the red/NIR spectral region. Here, chlorophyll molecules extracted from Spirulina maxima, an abundant cyanobacterium and an attractive natural source, are immobilized in organic–inorganic di- and tri-ureasil matrices enabling the production of sustainable LSCs. At low chlorophyll concentrations (<3 × 1017 molecules per cm3), the photophysical properties of the chlorophyll molecules after incorporation into the hybrids closely resemble those in ethanolic solution (with an absolute emission quantum yield of ∼0.16 and a fluorescence lifetime of ∼8 ns). The LSCs were coupled to a Si-based commercial PV device revealing optical conversion efficiency and power conversion efficiency values of ∼3.70% and 0.10%, respectively, illustrating the potential of this approach for the development of nature-based LSCs meeting the requirements of reliable, sustainable and competitive energy systems.
Introduction
The reliable supply of clean and affordable energies is a crucial challenge of the 21st century. This implies an increase in the use of renewable energies, preferentially those involving primary sources such as in the case of photovoltaics (PV).1,2 Among the several approaches in the literature to boost the PV cell performance, emphasis is given to luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs), whose number of related reports has exploded in the last few years,3–9 since the first reports in the 1970s.10–12 LSCs are complementary PV devices comprising a transparent matrix embedding optically active centres that absorb incident radiation, which is then re-emitted at a specific wavelength and transferred by total internal reflection to PV cells located at the edges of the matrix.10,12 The LSC's ability to concentrate sunlight onto small areas can contribute to reduce the size and cost of PV cells.5 The coupling of PV cells to the LSC edges is a very interesting strategy to PV urban integration, as LSCs could be embedded in façades, roofs, windows and walls and coupled to efficient and small PV cells, allowing everyday buildings to be transformed into harvesting machines9 and embedded in wearable flexible fabrics towards low-cost and mobile solar-energy harvesting.13
Featuring the LSCs' role as a complement to PV cell development,5 the design of efficient LSCs requires knowledge of the target PV cell, in particular of the material band gap energy that determines both the region of the solar spectrum that is absorbed and the efficiency of the PV cell, readily establishing the desired optical characteristics (absorption and emission range) of the LSC layer.14 Nowadays, c-Si PV cells are the leading technology in the PV market with a maximum reported efficiency of 26.7%,15 which is very close to the theoretical maximum established by the Shockley–Queisser limit of ∼33%.16,17 To improve the PV conversion efficiency based on the development of new solar cells we note the emerging field of perovskite-based PV cells that, over the last few years, have gained visibility due to the unprecedented increase in their efficiency values in such a short period of time (∼6 years).18,19 The 23.6% record for a tandem PV cell composed of perovskite and silicon was recently reported by K. Bush et al.20 Despite these promising advances, efficiency is still low, especially in the UV spectral region and improving their stability is now an important issue, since they degrade under ambient conditions, when exposed to air, moisture and UV radiation.21,22
Both c-Si and perovskite PV cells display large external quantum efficiency (EQE) in the red/NIR spectral region (∼700 nm to 1100 nm), and, therefore, red/NIR emitting LSCs are looked-for to maximize the performance of these PV cells. Despite some examples mentioning the potential of NIR-emitting quantum dots (QDs),23–27 for which the optical conversion efficiency (ηopt defined as the ratio between the output optical power, Pout, and the incident optical power, Pin) could reach values up to 14.6%,24 lower experimental ηopt values have been reported so far.2,28–33 For single-edge planar NIR-based LSCs based on QDs, namely PbS,28,29 PbS/CdS30 and CISeS/ZnS,2ηopt is below 6.1%,30 and for LSCs based on organic dyes, such as silicon 2,3-naphthalocyanine bis(trihexylsilyloxide) (SiNc) immobilized in an organic–inorganic tri-ureasil matrix, ηopt = 1.5%.33 Larger values for red/NIR emitting LSCs were only reported for cylindrical devices based on PbS QDs (ηopt = 6.5%).28
The potential replacement of QDs and synthetic organic dyes with red/NIR luminescent nature-based organic molecules extracted from natural pigments could make LSCs cheaper and sustainable, as well as providing other intrinsic properties such as synthetic versatility, and high absorption coefficients and emission quantum yield.34
Aiming at following a sustainable route for designing LSCs, photosynthesis may be an inspiring natural mechanism if PV solar energy conversion is compared to an artificial photosynthesis process which is stopped short.35 The optical and electrical functions of LSCs and their attached PV cells mimic the light collection and charge generation processes, respectively.35 In photosynthesis, one key molecule is chlorophyll as it is responsible for sunlight harvesting36 with emission properties in the red/NIR spectral region. The attractive properties of nature-based dye molecules for LSCs have been poorly explored. Emphasis has been given to exploring the Förster energy transfer to minimize re-absorption losses. Examples include LSCs using the BODIPY emitter covalently bound to oligofluorene dispersed in a polymer matrix of lauryl methacrylate and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate with a maximum EQE of ∼2.44% (ref. 34) and phycobilisomes in acrylamide films35,37 with optical quantum efficiency (defined as the fraction of incident photons that are emitted from the edges of the substrates) quantified through an integrating sphere of 12.5%.35
In this work, novel chlorophyll-based LSCs are processed and optically characterised. The chlorophyll molecules were extracted from Spirulina maxima which is an abundant cyanobacterium and an attractive natural source. To enable easy and controlled processing of planar LSCs, the chlorophyll molecules were incorporated into amine-functionalized organic–inorganic hybrids (di- and tri-ureasils) with the added advantages of avoiding the formation of non-luminescent dye-clusters or dye-aggregates,33 enhancing quantum yield and photostability.38 The chlorophyll-based LSCs were coupled to a Si-based PV device, revealing ηopt and power conversion efficiency (PCE) values around ∼3.70% and 0.10%, respectively, demonstrating the huge potential of nature-inspired LSCs for sustainable PV energy conversion. A quantitative evaluation of the chlorophyll-based LSC performance was corroborated by Monte Carlo ray-tracing simulations, indicating that the optical efficiency can still be maintained for larger devices.
Experimental
Materials and methods

Synthesis and processing. 
Jeffamine® ED-600 (97%, Huntsman), Jeffamine® T-5000 (97%, Huntsman), 3-isocyanatopropyl triethoxysilane (ICPTES, 95%, Aldrich), ethanol (EtOH, 99.8%, Fluka Riedel-de Haën and Fisher Scientific), tetrahydrofuran (THF, 99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37%, Sigma-Aldrich), and chlorophyll extracts (from Spirulina maxima) were used as received. High purity distilled water was used in all experiments.


Non-hydrolyzed hybrid precursors, d-UPTES(600) and t-UPTES(5000). 
Both precursors, d-UPTES(600) and t-UPTES(5000), were synthesized by reacting each of the –NH2 groups of Jeffamine® (2 from ED-600 and 3 from T-5000) with the –NCO group of ICPTES (1:2 molar ratio for ED-600 and 1:3 for T-5000), in THF (2:1 v/v THF/Jeffamine®), at 82 °C under reflux and magnetic stirring for 18 h. The t-UPTES(5000) precursor was obtained as a viscous transparent liquid after rotary evaporation to remove THF. The same purification process yielded a viscous yellowish liquid for d-UPTES(600). Both suspensions were transferred to a capped transparent glass bottle and stored at 10 °C.


Extraction and purification of chlorophyll a from Spirulina maxima39. 
Chlorophyll was obtained from Spirulina maxima via solvent extraction and purified by column chromatography. An amount of 5 g of Spirulina maxima powder (supplied by a local Brazilian pharmacy shop) was dispersed in 50 mL of dichloromethane (Synth PA-ACS) in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask at room temperature. The suspension was kept under magnetic stirring for 20 minutes and thereupon, filtered on standard filter paper (pleated fold). The liquid phase, containing chlorophyll-a (chl-a), β-carotene and xanthophylls, was transferred to an amber flask and stored in a refrigerator. The solid phase was re-suspended in 50 mL of dichloromethane and underwent the same extraction process 3 additional times. The extract solution (200 mL) was concentrated to a final volume of 5 mL on a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure. Due to the presence of light in the environment where the extraction and purification processes are carried out, all the flasks containing the extract must be lightproof to avoid photo-degradation of chl-a. The extract purification was performed on a silica gel (200–400 mesh, 2 cm in diameter and 15 cm high) chromatographic column, packed with toluene. To prevent oxidation of the chlorophyll molecules, the column was wrapped with a black plastic film and the eluates were collected in amber flasks. The first elution was performed with the same column packing solvent (150 mL of toluene) to remove carotenes and xanthophyll, which are detected by the presence of yellow and orange colours. The elution of the dark blue/green solution, rich in chl-a, was performed with dichloromethane. Dark green chl-a crystals (ChE) were obtained from the dichloromethane solution, by removing the solvent in a rotatory evaporator (over the course of the process, the solution was kept in a lightproof flask). The ChE were transferred to lightproof Petri dishes and stored within a vacuum desiccator at 15 °C to avoid auto-oxidation processes.


Synthesis of the chlorophyll-doped hybrid thin films and monoliths. 
The ChE were dissolved in ethanol (P.A. ACS reagent 96%) under magnetic stirring for 15 minutes at room temperature. The d-UPTES(600) (or t-UPTES(5000)) precursor suspension was added to this solution and kept under magnetic stirring for 30 minutes at room temperature. Distinct concentrations of ChE were calculated since ChE presents a 95% purity (predominantly chl-a) and a molar mass of 893.51 g mol−1 (Table 1). The volume of ethanol used to dissolve each mass was 2 mL and the mass of the viscous suspension of each ureasil precursor was 3 g. The molecular density of ChE in the final materials (Table 1) was calculated based on the premise that all the solvent (added or produced over the sol–gel condensation) evaporated after the processing, and that the density of the resulting hybrids was ∼1.0 g cm−3. To obtain the monoliths and thin films, part of the as-prepared ChE-containing suspensions was submitted to a sol–gel transition, by adding an ethanolic solution of HCl (1.2 M) as a catalyst [400 μL for d-UPTES(600) and 200 μL for t-UPTES(5000)]. Part of the volumes was cast onto polystyrene molds (1.0 × 1.0 × 4.0 cm3), covered with Parafilm, and kept at 40 °C for 3 days, yielding greenish-transparent monoliths. The remaining volumes of the suspensions were deposited on glass substrates (NORMAX, 7.6 × 2.6 × 0.1 cm3) by a one-step spin-coating process (SPIN 150-NPP, APT) at 1000 rpm for 60 s, under ambient conditions. The resulting films were heat-treated at 45 °C for 24 h to remove the residual solvents. Refractive index dispersion curves and thickness (10–13 × 10−6 m) of the films were measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry (see ESI for details, Fig. S1, S2 and Table S1†). The reported values for the thickness and refractive index are the average of three measurements performed for each sample with a maximum standard deviation of 1%. The hybrid materials will from now on be referred as named in Table 1.

Attenuated total reflectance (ATR)/Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. 
ATR/FT-IR spectra were registered on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS50 FT-IR spectrometer, resorting to an ATR accessory with a diamond crystal.


UV/visible absorption. 
UV/visible absorption spectra were measured using a Lambda 950 dual-beam spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer).


Photoluminescence spectroscopy. 
The photoluminescence spectra were recorded at room temperature with a modular double-grating excitation spectrofluorimeter with a TRIAX 320 emission monochromator (Fluorolog-3, Horiba Scientific) coupled to an R928 Hamamatsu photomultiplier. Emission decay curves were recorded at room temperature on a Fluorolog TCSPC spectrofluorometer (Horiba Scientific) coupled to a TBX-04 photomultiplier tube module (950 V) and a 200 × 10−9 s time-to-amplitude converter with a delay of 70 × 10−9 s (ESI†). The excitation source was a Horiba/Jobin-Yvon pulsed diode (NanoLED-390, peak at 388 nm, 1.2 × 10−9 s pulse duration, 1 MHz repetition rate, and 150 × 10−9 s synchronization delay).


Absolute emission quantum yield. 
The absolute emission quantum yield values (q) were measured at room temperature using a C9920-02 Hamamatsu system. The method was accurate within 10%.


Random laser. 
Random laser action was explored by exciting a higher concentrated ground sample (tU5–chl-5) by the frequency doubled or tripled output of a 20 Hz mode-locked Nd:YAG laser (PL2250 EKSPLA) with a 30 ps pulse duration. Emission spectra and lifetimes were measured as a function of the excitation energy by using an imaging spectrograph (Chromex A6365-01) connected to a 2 ps resolution Streak Camera (C5680 Hamamatsu).


Optical conversion efficiency (ηopt) and external quantum efficiency (EQE). 

η
opt is defined in different ways in the literature. The most used definition is given by:40 (1)where ILSC and VL0 represent the short-circuit current and the open voltage when the PV device is coupled to the LSC, Fig. 1, (Isc and V0 are the corresponding values of the PV device exposed directly to solar radiation), As and Ae are the exposed and total edge area respectively, ηsolar is the efficiency of the PV device relative to the total solar spectrum and ηPV is the efficiency of the PV device at the LSC emission wavelengths. The relative error (Δηopt/ηopt) is below 0.1% (see ESI for details†).
 Fig. 1  Representative scheme of the Chl-based LSCs attached to the c-Si PV cells. The arrows inside the LSC indicate the total internal reflection of the emitted light. The dashed arrows represent the PV cell coupling region. 
To enable a comparison with the literature, an alternative definition will also be considered:41 (2)
The experimental ηopt values were determined by illuminating the top surface of the LSCs with simulated AM1.5G illumination. The optical power at the LSC output was estimated using a commercial photodiode (IF D91, Industrial Fiber Optics, Inc.) with a wall-plug efficiency to the AM1.5G solar spectrum distribution of 4%. The photodiode was coupled to one edge of the LSC while kept inside a black cap to prevent the influence of direct illumination from the solar simulator. The Isc and V0 values were measured using a source meter device (2400 SourceMeter SMU Instruments, Keithley). No reflective devices were used on the other edges or on the backside of the LSC. All measurements were performed under AM1.5G illumination (1000 W m−2) using a 150 W xenon arc lamp, class A, solar simulator (Model 10500, Abet Technologies). The mismatch in the UV spectral region between the AM1.5G solar irradiance and that of the Xe lamp in the solar simulator was taken into consideration following a methodology reported in detail elsewhere,42 revealing that it does not affect the calculation of the ηopt values for the particular case of the chlorophyll-based LSCs.
The EQE was calculated as follows: (3)where e is the charge of the electron, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light and λ is the wavelength. The solar simulator was coupled to a monochromator (Triax 180, Horiba Scientific). The Isc and Pin values were measured using the above mentioned source meter and a c-Si calibrated photodiode (FDS1010, Thorlabs), respectively.


Power conversion efficiency (PCE). 
The PCE was calculated as follows: (4)where Pelout and FF = 0.75 are the PV device output electrical power and fill factor, respectively.

Results and discussion
The local-structure of the chlorophyll-based organic–inorganic hybrids was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and 29Si magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy, revealing that the local structure of the organic–inorganic hosts, d-U(600)43,44 and t-U(5000),45,46 remained essentially unaltered after the inclusion of the chlorophyll molecules (Fig. S3 and S4 in the ESI†). The preservation of the hybrids' local structure after the incorporation of organic dye molecules was also observed for tri-ureasils doped with SiNC, revealing that ureasils are efficient hosts for dye molecules.33
The electrostatic interaction between the d-U(600) and t-U(5000) hosts and the chlorophyll molecules was further studied by ATR/FT-IR spectroscopy (Fig. 2 and S5 in the ESI†). The intrinsic molecular electron density distribution in chlorophyll molecules is characterized by (i) polar bonds to magnesium located on the chlorin ring; (ii) a few polar functional groups and (iii) a hydrocarbon tail, and thus, the interaction with the hybrids' amide non-polar groups by means of London forces is expectable. In this sense, the ATR-FTIR analysis focuses on the amide I (1700–1600 cm−1) and amide II (1600–1500 cm−1) regions,47Fig. 2(a). The hydrogen bonding in amide I and II regions arises from interactions between urea groups of different chains, and between bonded urea groups and the PEO chains.47 The amide I region provides information about the degree of hydrogen bonding interactions, mainly associated with νCO (1637 cm−1), Fig. 2(b and c), which are involved in more ordered hydrogen-bonded urea–urea associations.47 The absence of the peak at 1750 cm−1 in the chl-doped hybrids indicates that there are no free urea groups (not associated by means of hydrogen bonds). After the incorporation of the chlorophyll, the position of the energetic peak of amide I remains constant (1637 cm−1), Fig. 2(b and c), indicating that the urea–urea aggregates are unaffected as the chlorophyll concentration increases.48 However, a narrowing of the peak full-width-at-half-maximum (fwhm) is observed as the concentration of chlorophyll increases, Fig. 2(d). The larger variation of the fwhm in the t-U(5000)-based hybrids suggests a stronger interaction between the chlorophyll molecules and t-U(5000) compared with that occurring with d-U(600).

Focusing on amide II, the energy and fwhm of the dominant peak at 1560 cm−1 remain unchanged, as the chlorophyll concentration increases in both hybrids (a negligible red-shift below 1.6 cm−1 was detected for the d-U(600)-based materials). Thus, it can be concluded that chlorophyll (or pheophytin) molecules interact with oxygen atoms from the carbonyl groups, which also leads to a reorganization of hydrogen bonds in the amide I environment,48 in which the observed narrowing, Fig. 2(d), can be associated with a more organized environment induced by the chlorophyll incorporation.
The predominant interaction of the chlorophyll molecules with the oxygen atoms of the urea groups rather than with those from the PEO chains is also inferred from the ATR/FT-IR spectra acquired at lower frequencies (Fig. S5 in the ESI†). In this energetic region, the transitions are mainly associated with the PEO chains, namely at 1350 cm−1 (ωCH2) and 1250–1195 cm−1 (τCH2), the siliceous nanodomains at 1083 cm−1 (νCO and νSiOSi for SiO2 clusters) and polar groups attached to the chlorin ring of chlorophyll and pheophytin at 1031 cm−1 (νCO and νCOCH3) and 918 cm−1 (νCC and ρCH2). Apart from a minor blue-shift (∼7 cm−1) of the maximum frequency of the peak at 1083 cm−1 and a decrease in the relative intensity between this peak and that at 918 cm−1 for d-U(600) samples, no significant changes are observed after the chlorophyll incorporation.
The light-harvesting ability of all the chlorophyll-based hybrids was studied by absorption spectroscopy, Fig. 3 and S6 in the ESI†. To enable an accurate interpretation, the same analysis was performed for the isolated chlorophyll molecules by diluting a Spirulina maxima extract in ethanol, as illustrated in Fig. 3(a). The Spirulina maxima-related spectrum reveals two main components at 415 nm and 665 nm ascribed to the monomer form of chl-a, and two shoulders around 465 nm and 648 nm attributed to the contribution of chlorophyll b (chl-b) monomers. The larger relative intensity of chl-a, compared with that of chl-b points out a larger concentration of the chl-a species. The two main absorption bands of chl-a are ascribed to π–π* transitions, where the high-energy component in the blue region (415 nm) is termed a Soret band, and the low-energy one in the red spectral range (648 nm) is ascribed to the S0(0)–S1(0) transition.49,50
 Fig. 3  Absorption spectra of (a) chl-a, chl-b,50 and chlorophyll extract in an ethanolic solution [10−5 M] and of (b) tU5–chl-3 and dU6–chl-3. 
After the incorporation of the Spirulina maxima extract into the hybrid hosts, the spectra reveal minor changes, when compared with those of the solutions, as illustrated in Fig. 3(b) for selected hybrid materials. Such minor changes can be correlated with the acid environment, to which the precursor suspensions were submitted over the course of the acid catalysed sol–gel transition. A slight blue shift is observed for the maximum wavelengths of the UV-Vis peaks in the spectra of the chlorophyll extract, assigned to the conversion of chl-a to pheophytin-a, when the porphyrinic Mg2+ is replaced by two H+ at low pHs.39
The spectra are clearly dominated by the chl-a contribution, reinforcing that the chlorophyll extracts are mainly from chl-a. Whilst for the Soret band a blue shift of ∼474 cm−1 (∼8 nm) is detected, the S0(0)–S1(0) transition broadens and deviates towards the red ∼159 cm−1 (∼7 nm) for both hybrid hosts, with respect to the absorption spectrum of the chlorophyll extract solution. This red-shift of the S0(0)–S1(0) transition points out the formation of dimers49,51 and the emission broadening observed after the incorporation of the chlorophyll in the hybrids is probably related to changes in the local structure of the chlorophyll molecules due to the rigidity of the host,46 as demonstrated by ATR/FT-IR (Fig. 2). The absorbance around 615 nm can be ascribed to the presence of dimers in the solid state. We note the presence of excited states within 450–550 nm (marked with an asterisk in Fig. 3(b)), most likely due to the presence of carotenoids as contaminants.52
When excited within the region of the absorption spectra, the emission of the chlorophyll-based hybrids is visible to the naked eye in the red spectral range (Fig. 4).

To discern the contribution of chl-a and chl-b, the fluorescence spectra of the ethanolic solution with Spirulina maxima extract incorporated into the hybrids were compared with those arising from diluted ethanolic solutions containing only chl-a and chl-b molecules, Fig. 5(a and b).
 Fig. 5  Emission spectra of (a) chl-a and chl-b in diluted [10−5 M] ethanolic solution from ref. 56 and 57 and chlorophyll extract and (b) dU6–chl-4 and dU6–chl-1 excited at 360 nm. Excitation spectra of (c) chl-a and chl-b in diluted [10−5 M] ethanolic solution from ref. 58 and chlorophyll extract and (d) dU6–chl-4 monitored at 460 nm and 675 nm. 
In good agreement with that suggested by absorption spectroscopy measurements, the emission spectra of the Spirulina maxima extract resemble those of chl-a, whose emission peak lies at around 675 nm. We note that the typical emission of chl-b around 650 nm is not discerned. The broadening of the chl-a emission spectrum for the case of Spirulina maxima suggests that chl-a experiences distinct microenvironments in the extract.53 After the extract incorporation into the hybrids, the emission spectra depend on the chlorophyll concentration, Fig. 5(b). For the less concentrated samples, the room-temperature emission spectra are dominated by the overlap between the blue-green emission attributed to electron–hole recombination occurring in the urea groups and within oxygen defects in the siliceous skeleton of the hosts43,54 and the chl-a fluorescence peak in the red spectral region,49 as illustrated in Fig. 5(b). Increasing the chlorophyll concentration, the relative intensity of the hybrid host emission decreases, Fig. 5(b), suggesting the presence of efficient hybrid-to-chlorophyll energy transfer since more molecules are located near the hybrid's emitting centres, as suggested by ATR/FT-IR data (Fig. 2). This means that there is a higher number of amide-based emitting centres transferring energy to the chlorophyll molecules, thus contributing to a continuous decrease of the hybrid's radiative transitions. The emission spectra of the lowest concentration doped samples (Fig. S7 in the ESI†) make it obvious that the t-U(5000)-based samples show a more efficient energy-transfer process between the host and the chlorophyll molecules than the d-U(600)-based ones, in good agreement with the ATR/FT-IR analysis (Fig. 2) which suggests a larger chlorophyll interaction over amide groups in t-U(5000)-based hybrids compared with the d-U(600) ones. The presence of two distinct chl-a related components (∼675 nm and 720 nm) in all the emission spectra points out the formation of aggregates in the solid state (Fig. 5(b) and S7 in the ESI†).51 Also, by increasing the chlorophyll concentration it is possible to observe a red-shift in the emission peak, relative to the absorption spectrum, suggesting the presence of J-dimers55 (Fig. S7 in the ESI†).
Focusing our attention on the chlorophyll characteristic emission, the presence of a main component at 675 nm and a shoulder at 720 nm is noticeable, ascribed to the chl-a monomeric and dimeric contributions, respectively.49,59 Another component is present at 645 nm (most evident for the d-U(600)-based samples, see Fig. S7 in the ESI†) and is also ascribed to the microenvironments of chl-a emission.56 On lowering the temperature to 11 K, the spectra of d-U(600)-based samples are dominated by the host contribution, whereas for the t-U(5000) based samples, apart from an increase in the relative intensity of the hybrid's intrinsic emission, the spectra are analogous to those acquired at 300 K (Fig. S8 in the ESI†).
Comparing the absorption and the emission spectra of the chlorophyll solutions the Stokes-shift is ∼314 cm−1 (∼14 nm, Fig. S9 in the ESI†). Upon the incorporation of chlorophyll into d-U(600) and t-U(5000), there is a decrease in the Stokes-shift to values below ∼66 cm−1 (∼3 nm) and ∼133 cm−1 (∼6 nm) for the t-U(5000) and d-U(600) based samples, respectively (Fig. S9 in the ESI†) tentatively attributed to an increase in the rigidity of the chromophore environment that excludes non-fluorescent relaxation to a ground state.60,61 Although the Stokes-shift for the hybrid-based samples is significantly lower than that measured for the chlorophyll solutions (Fig. S9 in the ESI†), the Stokes-shift increases with increasing concentration for both hybrids, indicating that greater intermolecular interactions occur between the hybrid and the chlorophyll chromophore molecules.

Fig. 5(c and d) show the excitation spectra of a diluted ethanolic solution of chl-a and chl-b and the excitation spectrum of an ethanolic solution with Spirulina maxima extract. All the spectra resemble the absorption spectra (Fig. 3), revealing essentially the main bands ascribed to chl-a excited states. Fig. 5(d) illustrates the typical excitation spectrum monitored within the chlorophyll maximum emission peak (∼675 nm) and within the hybrid emission band (∼460 nm). The former reveals the characteristic bands of chl-a, as already noticed in the absorption spectrum (Fig. 3(b)), despite a minor blue-shift when compared with the excitation spectrum of the solution of chlorophyll extract (Fig. 5(c) and S10 in the ESI†). Moreover, we note that the contribution of the hybrid host excited states to chlorophyll-related emission cannot be neglected as the excitation spectrum monitored within the host emission broad band overlaps with that monitored within the chl-a band, in particular in the UV spectral region (250–400 nm). When the excitation spectrum is monitored within the hybrid emission band (∼460 nm) the hybrid excited states appear as expected for both d-U(600) and t-U(5000) (Fig. S10 in the ESI†) showing excitation maxima peaking between 350 nm and 370 nm, depending on the monitoring wavelength.43,46 The presence of the hybrid states in this spectral region is in good agreement with the hypothesis of hybrid-to-chlorophyll energy transfer. The excitation spectra of both chlorophyll-based hybrids remain practically unchanged when the concentration varies, apart from minor changes in the relative intensities (Fig. S10 in the ESI†).
Further evidence of hybrid-to-chlorophyll energy transfer was found by time-resolved fluorescence measurements of the chlorophyll solution incorporated into both hybrids, namely, through the calculation of the fluorescence lifetime for selected samples. The emission decay curves were selectively monitored for the hybrid host (445 nm) and the chl-a excited states at 675 nm. In all cases, the experimental curves are well described by single exponential functions (Fig. S11 in the ESI†). The lifetime values monitored within the hybrids' emission band (Table 2) are lower than those previously reported for the isolated hybrids d-U(600) (∼2–15 × 10−9 s)62 and t-U(5000) (30.2 ± 0.2 × 10−9 s).40 Moreover, the lifetime values obtained monitoring the chlorophyll emission band are analogous (Table 2) to those previously reported for chl-a in ethanolic solutions (6.1 ± 0.2 × 10−9 s).53 The decrease in the lifetime of the hybrid host excited states is in good agreement with the hybrid-to-chlorophyll energy transfer.63 Moreover, we also note that the hybrids' lifetime values slightly decrease (5–6%) as the concentration increases from dU6/tU5–chl-2 to dU6/tU5–chl-3 (Table 2), suggesting an increase in the non-radiative transition probability at higher chlorophyll concentrations.

The emission properties were further quantified through the measurement of the absolute emission quantum yield (q, Table 3), as a function of the excitation wavelength (360–530 nm) and of the chlorophyll concentration.

For all samples, the quantum yield is higher when the excitation wavelength is resonant with the chl-a Soret band (370 and 410 nm). However, at higher chl-a concentrations (dU6/tU5–chl-4), the quantum yield values are very similar, within the experimental error, and maximal (0.16 ± 0.02) for the tU5–chl-2. This value is analogous to that measured for the diluted chlorophyll solution, pointing out that the incorporation into t-U(5000) and d-U(600) did not contribute to an emission quenching and that the optical properties of the extract are well preserved in the solid state (at the concentration values in analysis). We note that, despite analogous quantum yield values, as the concentration increases from samples dU6/tU5–chl-1 to dU6/tU5–chl-3, the relative intensity of the chlorophyll-emission with respect to that of the hybrid host is larger (Fig. 5(b)). Therefore, featuring PV-related applications, samples with a larger contribution of chlorophyll emission (dU6/tU5–chl-2 or dU6/tU5–chl-3) are preferred as low energy photons (chlorophyll emission compared with those from the hybrid) coincide with larger Si-based PV device efficiency.
When the concentration is increased, the absolute emission quantum yield values of the dU6–chl-4 and tU5–chl-4 samples decrease to 0.03 ± 0.01 and 0.05 ± 0.01, respectively. Nevertheless, these quantum yield values are larger than those found in the solution with the same concentration (0.02 ± 0.01), indicating that at higher chlorophyll solution concentrations the hybrid hosts may prevent partial dye agglomeration. The strong quenching of the emission quantum yield for the more concentrated samples means that these are not viable for use in LSCs. Nevertheless, their potential as random lasers was evaluated, and a more concentrated sample was prepared (tU5–chl-5, Table 1). We ground tU5–chl-5 and explored if random laser action is observed in the resulting powder when increasing the pumping power at a 532 nm excitation wavelength. By using a streak camera, neither spectral narrowing nor intensity saturation of the emission spectrum could be observed up to 5000 μJ per pulse, but sample degradation occurred at such excitation energy (it became colourless). The lifetimes of the chl-a excited states were also measured for tU5–chl-5 as a function of the excitation energy. As shown in Table 4, the lifetime slightly decreases when increasing the excitation energy. Our results suggest that at high-chlorophyll concentrations and high pumping energies photodegradation occurs, and it was not possible to ensure enough amplification to induce any random laser-like effect (possibly also due to weak light scattering processes). Additionally, we employed the frequency tripled output of a ps laser to explore the spectral and temporal behaviour of tU5–chl-5 upon increasing the pumping power.

At 355 nm, random lasing was not observed either (Table 4). The emission spectra of tU5–chl-5 at different excitation energies evidence that the emission band shape does not change when increasing the excitation energy while the emission intensity saturates (Fig. 6).
 Fig. 6  Emission spectra of tU5–chl-5 pumping at 115 μJ per pulse (red line), 615 μJ per pulse (blue line), 1422 μJ per pulse (green line) and 3000 μJ per pulse (yellow line) and 4000 μJ per pulse (grey line), at 355 nm. 

Table 4 collects the change of the chlorophyll lifetime value in the employed pumping power range. Above 4000 μJ per pulse sample degradation occurs.
Focusing our attention on the less concentrated samples and aiming at selecting the chlorophyll-based hybrids with larger potential to maximize the performance of LSCs, Fig. 7(a), it is relevant to quantify the light harvesting ability,40 by the overlap integral is given by eqn (5):33 (5)where λ1 (300 nm) and λ2 (800 nm) are the limits of the spectral overlap between the absorption spectrum of each sample and the AM1.5G spectrum, ΦAM1.5G is the AM1.5G photon flux and A is the absorbance of the LSC's optically active layer. The spectral overlap is illustrated in Fig. 7(b) (shadowed area). The maximum value was calculated for dU6–chl-3, as listed in Table 3, indicating its potential to absorb ∼17% of the solar photon flux on the surface of the Earth (4.3 × 1021 photons per s per m2).7 The observed increment of O as the concentration increases results from the larger absorbance measured at higher concentrations. Further quantification of the light harvesting ability can be performed using the Beer–Lambert law, to calculate the molar extinction coefficient (ε, M−1 cm−1), where the chl-a concentration was estimated following a methodology described elsewhere.64 The ε values were quantified for the Spirulina maxima extract in ethanolic solution and after the incorporation into the hybrids, Table 3. The values found for the ethanolic solutions resemble those previously reported (7.0 × 104 M−1 cm−1, at 665 nm), Table S2 in the ESI.† After the chl-a incorporation into the hybrid, despite a small decrease in the molar extinction coefficients at 665 nm (Table S2 in the ESI†), there is an increase in the UV spectral region ascribed to the contribution of the hybrid host excited states in the UV.

(b) Absorption spectra (left axis) of dU6–chl-2 (green line) and dU6–chl-3 (orange line) and AM1.5G photon flux (right axis); the shadowed area represents the overlap integral O; (c) 2D-cross correlation between the EQE (%) and the excitation spectrum (PLE, a.u.) intensity for dU6–chl-2. 
Another relevant parameter for LSC performance is the trapping efficiency (ηt) that accounts for emission losses at the surface.8 The ηt values depend on the refractive index (n) of the optically active layer at the emission wavelength. By investigating the dispersion curves of the chlorophyll-based hybrids, (1.49 < n < 1.50 at 675 nm), trapping efficiency values ∼75% are predicted (Fig. S2 in the ESI†). The light emission efficiency and light harvesting ability can be related by the molar brightness (B), given by B = q × ε,65 allowing both properties to be compared across distinct samples. The B values were calculated for the hybrids with larger q values, Table 3, and are analogous to those reported for other organic-dye molecules, with light emission in the 530–650 nm range.66,67 We note a decrease of B as the concentration of chl-a increases for both ureasil hosts, mainly due to the concentration quenching.
Based on the results, dU6–chl-2 was selected to be tested as a planar LSC (1.0 × 1.0 × 0.3 cm3 and geometrical gain, G = 3.3) because it combines larger B values with higher integral overlap at lower chlorophyll concentration doping (Table 3). The LSC performance was quantified by the optical conversion efficiency through eqn (1) and (2), yielding ηopt = 3.70 ± 0.01% and ηopt = 5.55 ± 0.01%, respectively, in the total incident spectral range.
In an attempt to compare these values with those in the literature, care must be taken, in what concerns the LSC geometry, emitting range and the use of external devices to enhance LSC performance, as all these aspects directly contribute to ηopt. We note that considering single planar red/NIR emitting LSCs without back-reflectors, the value from eqn (1) can only be directly compared with that reported for the t-U(5000)/SiNc LSCs (ηopt = 1.5%),33 as a similar definition was used to estimate ηopt, Table 5. In what concerns the ηopt derived from eqn (2), it has been used to quantify the performance of visible (blue, green or red)-emitting devices based on organic synthetic dyes (Table 5). Independently of the followed ηopt definition, the results here highlight the potential of the chlorophyll-based hybrids as a sustainable alternative for LSCs.

Measurements performed in an LSC aged for 7 months under ambient conditions show no variation in its performance. Moreover, the photostability of the LSC was also assessed by measuring the ILSC under continuous AM1.5G illumination (1000 W m−2). The temporal relative variation of the short-circuit current reveals that the LSC is stable with a minor relative variation (ΔILSC/ILSC ∼ 1%) after 40 h (Fig. S12 in the ESI†). An analogous result demonstrating the ability of the organic–inorganic hybrid hosts to efficiently incorporate and stabilize organic dyes and lanthanide-based organic complexes for LSC applications was already reported.42
The active role of the chlorophyll-based LSC in enhancing PV device performance was inferred from the calculation of the EQE, eqn (3), on the PV device in the presence of the LSC. As can be noticed in Fig. 7(c), the EQE dependence on the wavelength correlates well with the excitation spectrum of the active layer. For the LSC based on dU6–chl-2, the EQE variation is more noticeable in the UV/blue region between 300 and 440 nm (EQE = 0.2022 ± (2 × 10−4) %), benefiting from the fact that in the UV/blue spectral range, the Si PV device has lower performance. Also, in that region the chlorophyll-based hybrids display larger sunlight harvesting and conversion efficiency (Table 3). The effective contribution of the LSCs on the PV device was further quantified by coupling the LSC to a Si-based PV device and calculating the PCE (see eqn (4) in the Experimental section for details), yielding PCE = 0.10 ± 0.01% and confirming that the use of chlorophyll-based LSCs as external devices for Si-based PV devices is advantageous. The highest value for PCE involving single planar LSCs coupled to Si-based PV devices (c-Si) without back-reflectors was reported for PbSe QDs (4.74%).72
In what concerns single dye-based LSCs, lower values were found (Table 6). An increase in dye-based LSC performance was only reported in the case of LSCs based on more than one emitting center, like the co-doping with two dyes, as listed in Table 6. The value found for chlorophyll-based LSCs although smaller than the previous examples is higher than that reported for planar Ln3+-based LSCs. This highlights the potential of the proposed approach in the use of natural-based dyes for the production of new and sustainable materials with tailored optical properties applied as efficient layers to energy conversion, enhancing the efficiency of commercial PV cells. We note that PCE is dependent on the optical properties of the semiconductor used to fabricate the PV cell. The PCE values reported for dye-doped LSCs coupled to GaAs- and CIGS-based PV cells are also listed in Table 6.

As mentioned, the coupling of PV cells to the LSC edges is a very interesting strategy for PV urban integration, as LSCs could be embedded in façades, roofs, windows and walls and coupled to efficient and small PV cells, allowing everyday buildings to be transformed into harvesting machines. We note that PCE = 0.10% indicated that the chl-based LSC will be able to provide for the PV cell an output electrical power, Pelout= 10−4 W, eqn (4). To increase this value, the scaling-up of the chl-based LSCs is required to permit its use as large-area devices applicable as PV windows able to supply enough energy, as the one delivered from a USB port and to charge low-voltage devices (e.g. such as mobile phones, sensors, wi-fi routers, Table S3 in the ESI†). Simulations of the performance of larger dimensions LSCs were carried out using a Monte Carlo ray-tracing approach, to demonstrate the feasibility of scaling-up the proposed chl-based LSC. As detailed in the next section, an average electrical power of 4 W can be provided by a 50 cm-wide waveguide (As = 2.5 × 10−2 m2) unequivocally demonstrating the potential of the chl-based LSCs for PV integration.
Modelling
Simulations of the LSC performance (ηopt) were carried out using a Monte Carlo ray-tracing approach, in which the photon propagation follows geometrical optical laws.71 The thickness of the chl-based layer (∼10−3 m) is much larger than that of the light coherent length (∼10−7 m), and thus, interference effects were neglected. The stochastic nature of the model is reflected in the fact that the propagated rays cannot split when reaching an interface but rather either transmitted or reflected, as predicted by Fresnel laws. We also note that incident light polarization is not taken into account. Modelling the path of each propagated ray it is possible to know whether the photons are trapped inside the LSC, absorbed by the luminescent species, lost due to the escape cone or absorption and if they were collected at the edges of the LSC.
The inputs of the Monte Carlo ray-tracing simulation consist of the solar spectrum AM1.5G (280–1600 nm), the absorption and emission spectra, the absolute emission quantum yield and dispersion curve of each LSC. Furthermore, we consider a thin layer of air underneath the LSC.
This model does not include individual molecules or optically active centres but applies statistical averaging of the absorption. First the absorption probability is calculated (pabs = 1–10−αd, where α is the attenuation coefficient (units cm−1) and d is the photon desired step size (0.02 cm) in each iteration) as a function of the wavelength and compared with a random generated number between 0 and 1 for each launched photon. If pabs proves to be higher than the random number the photon is absorbed otherwise, the photon continues to propagate accordingly to its direction vector. Once a photon is absorbed, the subsequent fate of the excitation (that is, emission or non-radiative relaxation) is again determined by the Monte Carlo sampling according to the emission quantum yield. The direction of the emission is randomly distributed and the emission wavelength is sampled randomly from the normalized emission spectrum. The ultimate fate of each photon is either loss due to non-radiative recombination or escape from the LSC from one of the interfaces. When a photon hits the PV interface, it counts as a PV cell absorption and the wavelength of the photon and its position on the PV interface are recorded.
The ηopt for simulation purposes is defined by the energy emitted (per unit of time) from the edge of the LSC divided by the solar energy falling on the LSC (per unit of time), as stated in eqn (1). The output of the simulation yields ηopt = 3.47 ± 0.01% for the dU6–chl-2 LSC with 1.00 × 1.00 × 0.25 cm3. This value is very close to that found experimentally (∼3.70 ± 0.01%) and to the value estimated through the ηopt definition based on the LSC main losses (eqn (S2) in the ESI†).
The good-agreement between the ray-tracing prediction and the experimental results points out that the simulation describes the main optical features and allows us to use the experimental device parameters to estimate the optical performances potentially achievable using waveguides of increasingly larger area or slab thickness.71,81
The ηopt was also estimated for lager area LSCs to discuss the feasibility of scaling-up the chl-based devices. A constant thickness of 10−3 m (typical value for a glass window) was considered in all the simulations and As was varied (10−4 < As < 10−2 m2). For these dimensions, ηopt is approximately constant (4.5%, Fig. S13(a) in the ESI†), which indicates that optical conversion efficiency can still be maintained at a relatively high level for larger devices. The PCE can be related to ηopt through the efficiency of the PV solar cells (PCE = ηPVηopt). Therefore, based on the experimental PCE value of 0.1%, we may estimate the As value expected to produce the desired Pelout, through Pelout = ηPVηoptAsIAM1.5G(6)where ηPV is the Si-PV cell efficiency (4% according to the manufacturer) and IAM1.5G = 1000 W m−2. For a set Pelout = 4 W we estimate that an LSC with As = 2.5 × 10−2 m2 is required.
Conclusions
In this work, nature-based LSCs made of chlorophyll molecules dispersed in organic–inorganic ureasil hybrids were studied. The chlorophyll-based active layer displays a large overlap with the solar irradiance on the surface of the Earth, (absorption at 300–450 nm and 600–850 nm) and emission spectra centered around 675 nm. At low chlorophyll concentration values (1017 molecules per cm3), the optical properties (fluorescence lifetime, quantum yield and brightness) are preserved after the incorporation into the hybrids hosts. The optimised hybrid sample (ηopt = 3.70 ± 0.01%) was tested as an LSC coupled to commercial Si-based PV devices, revealing an effective contribution to its performance, namely, an increase in the PCE (0.10 ± 0.01%). The use of natural red/NIR emitting dyes, such as chlorophyll molecules, as active layers in LSCs, demonstrates the huge potential of nature-inspired LSCs as a relevant step toward sustainable PV energy conversion.
