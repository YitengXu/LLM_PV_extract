In this study, the degradation mechanism of organic–inorganic halide structures in humidity was investigated computationally. Owing to the high polarity of water molecules, the unprotected organic–inorganic structure will inevitably decompose in a humid environment. To improve the ambient stability of the organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells, we introduced an interface modification method using ultrathin compact aluminum oxide (Al2O3) layers deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD). The experimental results showed the ambient stability of the organic–inorganic perovskite solar cell with an ultrathin compact Al2O3 layer was greatly improved without a significant reduction in efficiency.
Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskites have attracted significant attention owing to the very rapid progress in researching their photovoltaic properties. To date, considerable effort has been focused on the fabrication of high-performance perovskite solar cells based on CH3NH3PbI3. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been increased to a certified 17.9% and most recently to 19.3%.1 Although device stability of 500 h has been reported in nitrogen gas with encapsulation,2 it has also been reported that CH3NH3PbI3 films easily degrade into other chemical species in the presence of moisture.3 To realize the successful commercialization of organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells, it is necessary to achieve stability in the addition to high efficiencies. However, to date, studies on the degradation mechanisms of organic–inorganic halide structures have been limited, and methods to improve the stability are not well understood.
Organic–inorganic perovskites are hybrid layered materials, typically with an AMX3 structure, where A is an organic cation, M is a smaller metal cation, and X is an anion from the halide series. In these organic–inorganic halides, the organic cations are small and are typically restricted to methylammonium, ethylammonium, and formamidinium.4,5 The metal cations are typically divalent metal ions, such as Pb2+ and Sn2+,6,7 and the halide anions are I−, Cl−, and Br−.8,9 In this study, we introduced a theoretical calculation to analyze the interaction between the inorganic and organic units and to estimate the stability of the organic–inorganic hybrid structure. Based on the calculation, we found that the strength of the hydrogen bonds between the inorganic and organic units had a significant effect on structural stability. The high polarity of the water molecule will inevitably cause the decomposition of the unprotected organic–inorganic structure in a humid environment. To increase the stability of solar cells, a hydrophobic polymer (poly[2,5-bis(2-decyldodecyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione-(E)-1,2-di(2,20-bithiophen-5-yl) ethene] (PDPPDBTE)) was employed instead of spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene) as a hole-transport material (HTM). Although the hydrophobic polymer prevented water permeation into the porous perovskite, the efficiency of the solar cell was just 9.2%, which was considerably lower than that of devices based on spiro-OMeTAD.10 Solution deposition of Al2O3 on the perovskite improved the stability of the perovskite to a certain extent, but the efficiency of this solar cell was only 4.6%.11 Remarkably, a device with no HTM and a 10 μm thick carbon layer as the electrode remained stable for more than 1000 h in ambient air under full sunlight.12 This stability is the result of the excellent waterproof performance of the carbon layer; however, the efficiency of this device cannot contend with those of devices with an HTM.1 Here, we report another effective method to retard the degradation of the perovskite structure based on an interface modification method that uses ultrathin compact aluminum oxide (Al2O3) layers deposited by ALD, which has almost no negative effect on device performance. The self-terminating process in ALD enables Angstrom-scale control over the coating thicknesses. The deposited layer's thickness is precisely controllable based on the number of ALD cycles. ALD conformally coats high surface area materials. ALD allows a variation of thicknesses at atomic resolution and also penetrates deep into nanoporous structures, which makes it a superior method compared to sol–gel techniques.13–18 All of these benefits make ALD suitable for depositing ultrathin layers. Moreover, ALD techniques can produce continuous, Angstrom-level-controlled, pinhole-free oxide films19,20 and has been widely used in the production of various types of solar cells.21,22 ALD–Al2O3 films have been reported to provide effective permeation barriers against oxygen23 and moisture.24,25 We have investigated the influence of ultrathin ALD–Al2O3 layers on the performance of organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells.
Computation method
All the calculations were performed using the GAUSSIAN-03 program. The minimum-energy structures of all molecular isomers were completely optimized using density-functional theory (DFT) employing Becke's three-parameter exchange potential and the Lee–Yang–Parr correlation functional (B3LYP). The LanL2DZ basis set was used for metal and halogen atoms, whereas the 6-311++G(d,p) basis set was used for C, N, O, and H atoms. Vibrational mode analyses were systematically carried out to confirm that on a potential energy surface, all the optimized geometries corresponded to a local minimum that had no imaginary frequency mode. The structural changes of the molecules under the influence of foreign water molecules were examined. To further investigate the strength of the interaction between the organic–inorganic hybrid and water molecules, a natural bonding orbital (NBO) analysis was carried out. The interaction energies were corrected for the basis set superposition error (BSSE) using the counterpoise correction method of Boys and Bernardi.26
Experimental section
Preparation and stability characterization of CH3NH3PbI3
The CH3NH3PbI3 layers were prepared in a N2-purged glove box using a CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution containing 40 wt% of synthesized CH3NH3I powder and PbI2 in γ-butyrolactone:dimethyl sulfoxide (7:3). This solution was spin-coated onto the compact TiO2 layers by two consecutive spin-coating steps at 1000 and 5000 rpm for 90 and 30 s, respectively. During the second spin-coating step, toluene (1 mL) was introduced dropwise onto the substrate. The substrate was then dried on a hot plate at 100 °C for 10 min. To investigate the influence of modifying the CH3NH3PbI3 interface with ALD–Al2O3, ultrathin Al2O3 films were deposited either beneath or above the spiro-OMeTAD layer on CH3NH3PbI3. Because of the humidity sensitivity of CH3NH3PbI3, trimethylaluminum (TMA, Al3(CH3)3) and ozone were chosen as the aluminum and oxygen sources, respectively, to deposit Al2O3 layers using the ALD method. High purity nitrogen gas was used as both the carrier and purge gases. In each ALD cycle, TMA was dosed into the reactor for 100 ms, which was then purged for 2 s before and after O3 was dosed into the reactor for 200 ms. In this study, the deposition temperature was 70 °C, which is lower than the commonly used temperature of 200 °C. This lower temperature was chosen because of the relatively low thermal stability of CH3NH3PbI3 and spiro-OMeTAD and the strong oxidation characteristics of O3. The deposition rate was 0.1 nm per cycle. The crystal structures of the films were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis with Cu Kα radiation (D/max 2500 PC, Rigaku Corporation, Japan; 2theta/theta, λ = 0.1542 nm) at 40 kV.
Fabrication and characterization of solar cells
Usually, devices are constructed from the bottom (the side from which the light is incident) on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass that is coated with a compact layer of n-type TiO2, which acts as the electron selective contact. The perovskite layer is then deposited on the n-type compact layer, followed by the p-type hole-conductor, which ensures the collection of holes selectively at the silver cathode. To investigate the influence of the ALD–Al2O3 interface modification on the performance of the organic–inorganic hybrid solar cells, three different solar cells were fabricated: FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag, FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/Al2O3/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag, and FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Al2O3/Ag. The 30 nm thick TiO2 layers were deposited using a sol–gel method with titanium isopropoxide. The back contact, consisting of a 120 nm thick silver layer, was thermally evaporated.
The photovoltaic characteristics were measured under 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5) illumination using a Keithley 2400 source meter. A solar simulator (500 W Xe lamp) (Japan SAN-EI ELECTRIC XES-40S1) was employed as the light source and the incident light intensity was calibrated by simultaneously using a standard silicon solar cell and a light intensity meter (Radiometer FZ-A). All measurements were performed in air at room temperature with a humidity of 45–50%. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were conducted using a Zahner IM6ex electrochemical workstation in the dark with a bias of 0.9 V. A perturbation of 10 mV was applied, and the frequency ranged from 1 MHz to 1 Hz.
Results and discussion
The precursor solution of CH3NH3PbI3 is generally prepared by mixing the powders of CH3NH3I and PbI2. We first investigated the most stable configurations of CH3NH3I and CH3NH3PbI3, as shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. When CH3NH2 and HI solutions are mixed for a long time, CH3NH3I can be formed. The calculations suggest that in CH3NH3I, three hydrogen atoms are covalently bonded to the nitrogen atom, and the other three hydrogen atoms are covalently bonded to the carbon atom to form the CH3NH3+ cation, which the iodine atom interacts with through hydrogen bonding rather than covalent bonding. To form CH3NH3PbI3, usually CH3NH3I and PbI2 are mixed. As shown in Fig. 1b, the Pb atom forms ionic bonds with the three I atoms to form the inorganic PbI3− anion, which is bound to the organic (CH3NH3)+ cation through hydrogen bonds. The binding energy for the formation of CH3NH3PbI3 from CH3NH3I and PbI2 is 1.40 eV.

To investigate the interactions between the organic and inorganic molecules, an NBO analysis was carried out. In the NBO analysis, the stabilization energy E(2) for each donor NBO (i) and acceptor NBO (j) associated with delocalization (“2e-stabilization”) i → j is estimated using:  where qi is the occupancy of the donor orbital, εi and εj are diagonal elements (orbital energies), and F(i,j) is the off-diagonal NBO Fock matrix element. Vicinal interactions between the delocalizing acceptor orbital and the orbital of the adjacent bonded atom (donor–acceptor NBOs separated by one connecting bond) can influence the molecular properties through delocalization interactions, known as the hyper conjugative effect. Table 1 lists the stabilization energies (in kcal mol−1) of the main interactions between the organic unit, inorganic unit, and H2O in the CH3NH3PbI3 system with and without H2O. As shown in Table 1, in CH3NH3PbI3, there are two major types of vicinal interactions, namely, (1) n(I) → σ*H–N (the lone pair of an I atom and the antibonding orbital of an (H–N) bond) and (2) n(I) → σ*H–C (the lone pair of an I atom and the antibonding orbital of an (H–C) bond). The stabilization energies of the two stereoelectronic interactions (1) are about 19 kcal mol−1, and are considerably larger than that of interaction (2). To investigate the influence of humidity on the stability of CH3NH3PbI3, we calculated systems composed of CH3NH3PbI3 and water molecules; the most stable systems are shown in Fig. 1c and d. The energy of the CH3NH3PbI3·H2O system is 0.526 eV lower than the total energy of the free CH3NH3PbI3 and H2O molecules, which means it is very easy for water to be adsorbed onto CH3NH3PbI3. When a CH3NH3PbI3 molecule encounters one water molecule, the weak donor–acceptor interaction (2) in the CH3NH3PbI3 molecule is broken and the two stereoelectronic interactions (1) are weakened, namely, the stabilization energies decrease from ∼19 to ∼13 kcal mol−1. Moreover, two further interactions between CH3NH3PbI3 and H2O molecules are established: (3) n(I) → σ*O–H and (4) n(O) → σ*N–H. The stabilization energy of the donor–acceptor interaction (4) between the lone pair of the O atom in H2O and the antibonding orbital of an (N–H) bond in the organic CH3NH3 unit is 21.8 kcal mol−1, which is considerably larger than that between the PbI3 and CH3NH3 units. As a result, one water molecule will reduce the stability of CH3NH3PbI3. Although water weakens the interactions between the PbI3 and CH3NH3 units in CH3NH3PbI3, the structure of CH3NH3PbI3 is not completely destroyed. However, when a CH3NH3PbI3 molecule encounters two water molecules, as shown in Table 1, the hydrogen bonds between the PbI3 and CH3NH3 units are nearly broken. The interaction (4) between the CH3NH3 unit and H2O is considerably larger than that between the PbI3 and CH3NH3 units in CH3NH3PbI3, which induces complete decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3. The results of this calculation are in agreement with experimental observations,1 where in low humidity, CH3NH3PbI3 is not easily decomposed and remains relatively stable, but once the humidity is increased the structure is quickly destroyed.

It is clear from the above calculation results that hydrogen bonding between the inorganic PbI3 unit and organic CH3NH3 unit plays a decisive role in the stability of CH3NH3PbI3. Therefore, two possible approaches to improve the stability of CH3NH3PbI3 are suggested. The first is to replace I atoms with more electronegative Br and Cl atoms. The second is to replace the CH3NH3 unit with an organic group that is more polar. For this reason, we calculated the most stable structures of CH3NH3PbI2Br, CH3NH3PbIBr2, CH3NH3PbI2Cl, and CH3NH3PbICl2. The structures of CH3NH3PbI2Cl and CH3NH3PbICl2 are similar to those of CH3NH3PbI2Br and CH3NH3PbIBr2, which are presented in Fig. 1e and f. As shown in Table 1, the stabilization energy of the vicinal interactions (1) between the organic and inorganic units in the hybrid molecule increases, which means the substitution of Br or Cl for I does somewhat improve the stability of the organic–inorganic molecule. The donor–acceptor interactions between CH3NH3PbI2Br, CH3NH3PbIBr2, CH3NH3PbI2Cl, or CH3NH3PbICl2 and water molecules are also tabulated. Because H2O is highly polar, similar to CH3NH3PbI3, when the organic CH3NH3 unit in CH3NH3PbI2Br, CH3NH3PbIBr2, CH3NH3PbI2Cl, and CH3NH3PbICl2 encounters H2O, bonds to two H2O molecules will be formed and the organic–inorganic structure will be destroyed. Although the stabilities of CH3NH3PbI2Br, CH3NH3PbIBr2, CH3NH3PbI2Cl and CH3NH3PbICl2 are slightly improved compared with CH3NH3PbI3, the effect is not great enough to inhibit degradation by H2O, which is in agreement with the report on the improvement of the stability of MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 when the content of Br was controlled.8
In addition, we chose the organic molecules NH2CH2NH2 and NH2CH2CH2NH2 to replace CH3NH2 in the organic–inorganic hybrid molecules. Fig. 2 shows the most stable configurations of these molecules and the systems with two water molecules. The donor–acceptor interactions between NH2CH2NH3PbI3 or NH2CH2CH2NH3PbI3 and water molecules were also calculated, as listed in Table 2. As shown in Table 2, in structures 2a and 2c, the stabilization energy for the interaction between the lone pair of I and the antibonding orbital of (N–H) is smaller. The large n(I) → σ*(N–H) stabilization energy determined for NH2CH2NH3PbI3 suggests that compared with CH3NH3PbI3 and NH2CH2CH2NH3PbI3, this molecule is relatively more stable. Overall, the calculations suggest that because of the high polarity of water, the organic–inorganic structure will inevitably change in a humid environment. Therefore, packaging and protecting the organic–inorganic perovskite will be a prerequisite for stability.

To retard the degradation of the perovskite structure in a humid environment, we chose the ALD method to deposit ultrathin Al2O3 films on CH3NH3PbI3. Moreover, we fabricated a series of perovskite solar cells with the FTO/TiO2/perovskite/Al2O3/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag structure. Fig. 3a shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of CH3NH3PbI3 covered with Al2O3 layers deposited using 1, 2, or 3 ALD cycles. The main diffraction peaks at 14.12°, 28.44°, and 43.23° are assigned to the 110, 220, and 330 peaks of CH3NH3PbI3, respectively, with an orthorhombic crystal structure. Notably, there is the signature of a peak at 12.65°, which is the (001) diffraction peak of PbI2. As the number of deposition cycles increased, this peak became stronger, indicating an increase in the PbI2 content in the CH3NH3PbI3 layer. Although a low deposition temperature of 70 °C was chosen, the decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3 was still not completely avoided because the strong oxidizer O3 was used. The current-density/voltage (J–V) curves measured in an air environment for the solar cells with different deposition cycles of Al2O3 layers on the perovskite layer are shown in Fig. 3b. Devices fabricated without an Al2O3 layer produced a short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) of 20.35 mA cm−2 and an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.05 V, which with a fill factor (FF) of 0.71 and yielded an efficiency of 15.2%. With the deposition of Al2O3 layers on the perovskite layers, the values of Jsc, Voc, and FF all decreased. We speculated that the presence of PbI2, resulting from the decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3 during the ALD deposition process, decreased the performance of the solar cells. Therefore, we modified the solar cell structure to be FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Al2O3/Ag, with the Al2O3 layers prepared on top of the spiro-OMeTAD layers. Fig. 3c shows a comparison of the XRD patterns of CH3NH3PbI3 that has been covered with a 100 nm spiro-OMeTAD layer and subsequently treated with different cycles of Al2O3 layers. A close examination of the region around the (110) diffraction peak at 14.12° shows no measurable peak at 12.65° for PbI2, indicating a high level of phase purity, even when five cycles of Al2O3 layers were deposited. The J–V curves for these solar cells (Fig. 3d) indicate that the deposition of 1–3 cycles of Al2O3 layers had no evident effect on the performance of the solar cell; however, when the number of cycles was increased to five, the current decreased sharply. The Al2O3 layers acted as protector against air, and can reduce the permeability toward moisture, thus enhancing the stability of the solar cells. However, if the film is too thick, a significant reduction in the quantum tunneling of the holes is expected, and the charge would, therefore, not be collected. Thick Al2O3 layers, which increase the series resistance of the solar cell, would also be responsible for the lower fill factor and open-circuit voltage. To further understand the influence of the ALD–Al2O3 on the devices, EIS measurements for each the perovskite solar cells with or without Al2O3 were carried out. In our case, because ultrathin ALD–Al2O3 acted as a water proofing agent between HTM and the contact electrode (CE), we were mainly concerned with the RC elements at the HTM/CE interfaces. Nyquist plots of the devices are shown in Fig. 5. It has been reported that in the EIS spectra of perovskite solar cells, the semicircle in the high frequency range is attributed to the diffusion of holes through the HTM, which is modeled by an HTM resistance, RHTM.27–30 The series resistance (RS) is equal to the value of the high-frequency intercept on the real axis. The right incomplete semicircle in the low frequency range is a transmission line, which is mainly attributed to recombination resistance (Rrec) between the perovskite film and the TiO2 film. It can be seen from Nyquist plots in the figure that the RS and RHTM values of the perovskite solar cell with 3-cycle-ALD–Al2O3 on HTM are a little larger than those of that without ALD–Al2O3. However, the perovskite solar cell with 5-cycle-ALD–Al2O3 has a much higher RS and RHTM. The EIS analyses are consistent with the I–V measurements of the perovskite solar cells.

XRD measurements were also performed to explore film stability and the degree of degradation over time. Fig. 4 shows a comparison of the XRD spectra of perovskite films with and without ultrathin ALD–Al2O3 layers on the HTM that were stored in 50% humidity for 0–24 days. In the perovskite film without spiro-OMeTAD and Al2O3 layers, most of the perovskite peaks disappeared after 5 days and an increased signal from PbI2 was observed. In addition, the color of this film changed from dark brown to yellow because of perovskite decomposition. The perovskite film with a 100 nm thick spiro-OMeTAD layer showed XRD peaks corresponding to both crystalline perovskite and PbI2. As the number of storage days increased, the PbI2 content in the film increased (Fig. 4a). Notably, in the perovskite film with a 100 nm-spiro-OMeTAD layer and 3-cycle ALD–Al2O3 layers, the main perovskite XRD peaks remained unchanged without the formation of any new peaks, even after being exposed to air for 24 days (Fig. 4c). Based on these results, we characterized the air stability of unencapsulated perovskite solar cells as a function of storage time in air at room temperature, as shown in Fig. 4b and d. With 3-cycle ALD–Al2O3 layers deposited on the spiro-OMeTAD layer, the solar cells exhibited significantly improved stability compared with that for the solar cell without ALD–Al2O3. The PCE of 12.9% was ∼90% of the initial value, even after storage for 24 days in air (Fig. 6).

Conclusion
We used molecular structure modeling to explain the degradation mechanisms of organic–inorganic hybrid structures and found that the hydrogen bonding interactions between the inorganic PbI3 unit and organic CH3NH3 unit play an important role in determining the stability of CH3NH3PbI3. The calculations suggested that the organic–inorganic structure would inevitably change in a humid environment because of the high polarity of water. Therefore, to inhibit the degradation of the perovskite solar cells in a humid environment, the organic–inorganic perovskite must be protected. We used the ALD method to deposit ultrathin Al2O3 films on the HTM layer. Ultrathin ALD–Al2O3 acted as a waterproofing agent and isolated the CH3NH3PbI3 layers from moisture and thus realized enhanced stability of the device and as far as possible, do not affect the performance by the tunneling effect. Remarkably, the PCE of the solar cell with ALD–Al2O3 retained ∼90% of its initial value after 24 days of storage in air. The concept and method of this effective solution to improve the stability of these devices can be applied to commercialized perovskite solar cell products.
