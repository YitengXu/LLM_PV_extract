    , Accepted 16th July 2019First published on 17th July 2019AbstractHybrid organic/inorganic organometal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been attracting enormous research interest. However, their performance improvement and engineering at the molecular level remain challenging for the inverted structures. Surface traps present in semiconductor films critically influence ultimate photovoltaic behaviors. A solution-processable and stable cathode buffer layer that can passivate surface traps is thus of great importance for the application of PSCs. Here, we successfully fabricated high performance and stable inverted planar PSCs by employing calcium acetylacetonate (Ca(acac)2), a molecular modulator, as the cathode interfacial layer (CIL). The average power conversion efficiencies of PSCs based on different perovskite photoactive layers were improved. Strikingly, FA0.85MA0.15Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3-based and MAPbI3-based PSC devices were found to have champion power conversion efficiencies of 20.15% and 18.23%, respectively. Importantly, Ca(acac)2-modified PSCs also have high stability. Their power conversion efficiencies decreased by only 15% after 30 days of storage and they show much suppressed hysteresis compared with the control devices (without interfacial modification).
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials, combining the superior optoelectronic properties of inorganic materials and the good solution processability of organic materials, have attracted extensive attention in recent years, and have become a dazzling star in the field of solar cells.1–4 Planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have drawn much research attention due to their simple processing, superior optical absorption, ultralong carrier diffusion length in perovskite layers, and high power conversion efficiencies (reaching 20%).5–8 The high performance of planar PSCs is attributed to the effective extraction of charge carriers from the perovskite absorber layer. The alignment of energy bands is therefore a key consideration for achieving this condition.9,10 In particular, cathode interfacial layers (CILs), which can modulate electron extraction, play an important role in planar PSCs.11–14 To efficiently collect electrons at the cathode, a cathode interfacial layer (CIL) is typically introduced between the electron transport layer (ETL) and metal electrode (for p–i–n type structure) or between the ETL and perovskite layer (for the n–i–p type structure).10–12,15,16 Various inorganic and organic materials such as ZnO, TiO2, LiF, perylene-diimide, ethoxylated poly[3-(6-trimethylammoniumhexyl)thiophene], bathocuproine, PN4N, Ti(acac)4, Hf(acac)4, Zr(acac)4, etc. have been successfully employed as CILs to enhance charge extraction and the stability of PSCs.17–22 Among the various CIL materials, alcohol-soluble fullerene derivatives are characterized by high electron mobility, their energy levels match with the energy level of PCBM and they can effectively passivate the surface states of the perovskite. Therefore, they are a good candidate for interfacial modification.23–27 Nevertheless, most of them are either sensitive to moisture, oxygen and organic solvents during processing or unstable in thermal and light soaking environments. Stable, low-cost and simple to process CILs are essential to the development of PSCs.
In this work, we investigated the effect of a Ca(acac)2 surface passivation layer introduced between the PCBM and Ag cathode for inverted planar PSCs. The PSCs with the Ca(acac)2 layer exhibit remarkable overall PCEs of 20.15% (FA0.85MA0.15Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3-based PSCs) and 18.23% (MAPbI3-based PSCs), higher than those of FA0.85MA0.15Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3-based PSCs (17.37%) and MAPbI3-based PSCs (14.53%) prepared without Ca(acac)2. It was found that the hysteresis in PSCs was effectively suppressed, associated with the improvement of fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE). Interestingly, the lifetime of Ca(acac)2-modified PSCs was significantly improved. They retained 85% of their original performance after 30 days of storage and the hysteresis was suppressed. The enhanced stability and suppressed hysteresis can be attributed to the improved film forming quality of the PCBM layer after inert Ca(acac)2 incorporation and surface trap passivation.
2. Experimental section
Materials
Indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate with a sheet resistance of 10 Ω sq−1 was purchased from Nanbo Group (Shenzhen, China). Formamidinium iodide (FAI), methylammonium bromine (MABr), lead iodide (PbI2), lead bromide (PbBr2), Ca(acac)2, hydroiodic acid (HI, 57 wt% in H2O), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and chlorobenzene (CB) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. PCBM was bought from Luminescence Technology Co., Ltd. Methylamine (CH3NH2, ca. 40% in water) was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.
Synthesis of CH3NH3I
Methylamine (27.86 mL) and hydroiodic acid (30 mL) were mixed at 0 °C and stirred for 2 h. The precipitate was recovered by evaporation at 50 °C for 1 h. The product was washed with diethyl ether three times and finally dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h.
Device fabrication
The ITO-coated glass substrates were ultrasonicated in a solution consisting of detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol for 15 min, and subsequently dried in an oven overnight. For NiOx, nickel(II) acetate tetrahydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99.0%, 50 mg mL−1 in ethanol) was spin-coated onto the substrates at 4000 rpm for 45 s and annealed at 300 °C for 1 h. For MAPbI3, the precursor solution was prepared by dissolving the mixture of PbI2 and CH3NH3I (1:1 in molar ratio) in a mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO (4:1 in volume ratio). For the mixed perovskite precursor, FA0.85MA0.15Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 was prepared by dissolving 1.2 M metal lead salts consisting of 0.85 PbI2 and 0.15 PbBr2 and 1.2 M organic salts consisting of 0.85 FAI and 0.15 MABr in a co-solvent of DMSO/DMF (4:1, by volume). The perovskite precursor solution was then spin-coated onto the ITO/NiOx substrate at 1000 rpm for 10 s and 4000 rpm for 40 s. During the second spin-coating step, the substrate was treated with CB drop-casting. Then, the films were annealed at 100 °C for 45 min. After they were cooled down to room temperature, PCBM (dissolved into chlorobenzene (CB), 20 mg mL−1) was spun on top of the formed perovskite layers (for samples with a PCBM layer). After that, the films were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min to enable the PCBM to crystalize and diffuse into the perovskite layer. The device was finished by spin coating a Ca(acac)2 solution with different concentrations. Finally, the device was transferred to a vacuum chamber (about 10−5 Pa), and a Ag electrode (about 60 nm thick) was thermally deposited onto it.
Measurements and characterization
The thicknesses of the perovskite films were examined by a film thickness measuring instrument (KLA Tencor D-120). The morphologies of the perovskite films were characterized by SEM (S4800, Hitachi, Japan). The transmittance and absorbance spectra were obtained by using a UV-vis spectrometer (PE Lambda 950 UV-vis spectrophotometer). The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were conducted in an ultra-high vacuum using a ULVAC-PHI ultraviolet photoelectron spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic He ultraviolet source HeI (hν = 21.22 eV). The photocurrent–photovoltage (J–V) characteristics of the perovskite solar cells were measured by using a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel Class A, 91195A) with a source meter (Keithley 2450) at 100 mW cm−2 illumination AM1.5G and a calibrated Si-reference cell certificated by NREL. The J–V curves of all devices were measured by masking the active area with a metal mask of 0.04 cm2 area. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured by using a power source (Newport 300 W xenon lamp, 66920) with a monochromator (Newport Cornerstone 260) and a multimeter (Keithley 2001). The excitation and emission spectra were measured using a HORIBA Fluorolog-III spectrofluorometer (Lake Shore Cryotronics as the cryogenic refrigeration equipment).
3. Results and discussion
Crystal quality and morphology of perovskite films are very important for perovskite solar cells. According to the SEM images in Fig. S1a and c (ESI†), uniform and pinhole-free perovskite films with large grain sizes were obtained in our case. Large grain size and especially the compact, well-crystallized film morphology are prerequisites for high-efficiency PSCs, since a higher density of larger grains means less grain boundaries and can positively suppress charge recombination due to the lower local density of charge traps in these regions.28,29 Fig. S1b and d (ESI†) show the XRD patterns of MAPbI3 on the ITO substrate, confirming the good crystalline structure of the deposited perovskite film.30–33
The device structure is shown in Fig. 1a (starting from the bottom: glass/ITO substrate, hole transport layer NiOx, perovskite photoactive layer, PCBM electron transport layer, and Ca(acac)2 CIL, with a final Ag electrode deposited via thermal evaporation). The cross-sectional SEM image of the device (Fig. 1b) shows a well-defined layer-by-layer structure with sharp interfaces. The molecular structure of the Ca(acac)2 CIL is shown in Fig. 1c.34,35 The band gap of Ca(acac)2 makes it suitable as a CIL introduced between PCBM and Ag, and the band energy diagram for the inverted perovskite solar cell is shown in Fig. 1d.35

The J–V characteristics of MAPbI3-based PSCs under AM1.5G simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 2a (for the optimum concentration of Ca(acac)2, see ESI,† Fig. S2 and Table S1; and for the J–V characteristics of FA0.85MA0.15Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3-based PSCs, see the ESI,† Fig. S3). The control device exhibits a PCE of only 14.53%, with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.02 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 21.49 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 66.29%. Strikingly, employing Ca(acac)2 as the CIL can significantly improve the performance of the device, with open-circuit voltage (Voc) reaching 1.04 V, short-circuit current density (Jsc) reaching 23.02 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) reaching 75.95%, resulting in a champion PCE of 18.23%. The steady-state outputs are 14.51% and 18.02% for the control and Ca(acac)2 as CIL devices, respectively (Fig. S8, ESI†). The enhanced Jsc and FF for those Ca(acac)2-modified devices can be interpreted as a consequence of the reduced surface traps and enhanced charge carrier extraction efficiency at the PCBM/Ag interface after the Ca(acac)2 CIL was introduced, which will be confirmed by our following experimental results. Furthermore, we also employed BCP or Zr(acac)2 as cathode interfacial layers. The performance of the MAPbI3-based devices is enhanced after the insertion of BCP or Zr(acac)2 between PCBM and the Ag electrode (champion PCE of 15.24%, 17.97%, respectively) compared with the control devices (Fig. S6, S7 and Tables S3, S4, ESI†).

Fig. 2b presents the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the corresponding solar cells. The integrated current densities estimated from the EQE spectra are 20.43 mA cm−2 and 21.96 mA cm−2 for the control and Ca(acac)2-modified devices, respectively. These are in good agreement with the Jsc values obtained from the J–V curves. The Ca(acac)2-modified devices exhibit a much higher photon-to-electron conversion efficiency as compared with the control device.
To investigate the hysteresis issue, the photo response behaviors of the PSCs were investigated in both reverse and forward scan directions (Fig. 2c and d). There is a noticeable hysteresis in the J–V curves of the control device without the Ca(acac)2 CIL (Fig. 2c). This inconsistency mainly occurs at the bias near Voc, resulting in an under-(in forward scan) or over-(in reverse scan) estimated FF and PCE. This effect is due to ion motion, charge trapping and ferroelectricity, which lead to the accumulation of charge or specific ions in the vicinity of the contact area to re-shield the electric field and change the internal built-in electric field. The hysteresis can be reduced with the use of Ca(acac)2 as a CIL (Fig. 2d). The hysteresis index (HI) for these devices can be calculated according to the following equation.3 (1)where JRS (0.8Voc) and JFS (0.8Voc) denote the current densities in the reverse and forward scan directions at bias = 0.8Voc, respectively. The HI for the control PSC without the Ca(acac)2 CIL was calculated to be 0.18, whereas the HI for PSC with the Ca(acac)2 CIL was calculated to be only 0.05. The reduction in hysteresis improves the consistency of J–V curves in the two scan directions (Table S2, ESI†). These results suggest that the Ca(acac)2 CIL might reduce interface defects and suppress surface charge trapping, which result in the reduction of hysteresis in the PSCs.36 These results confirm that interfacial modification with Ca(acac)2 can effectively improve device performance by passivating surface traps and enhancing the charge extraction efficiency at the cathode.37,38
To further understand the mechanisms underlying the suppressed hysteresis and enhanced device performance, we examined the surface topography and contact potential difference of PC61BM by SEM and AFM, respectively. The surface uniformity of the film prepared with Ca(acac)2 was better than that prepared without Ca(acac)2 (Fig. 3a and d). The improved surface uniformity was further confirmed by AFM (Fig. 3b and e). For the PCBM film without Ca(acac)2 (Fig. 3b), the root mean square roughness (Rq) and the arithmetic average roughness (Ra) are 0.708 and 0.479 nm, respectively, within the scanned area. In contrast, the Rq and Ra values for the PCBM/Ca(acac)2 film (Fig. 3e) are 0.398 and 0.315 nm, respectively. Dense and uniform PCBM/Ca(acac)2 layers are able to effectively isolate perovskite from electrodes to avoid direct contact between them, which is critical to improve the performance of PSCs.39,40

The work function match at the PCBM/Ag interface is very important for high-performance inverted planar PSCs. It was already recognized that the work function of an electrode (such as Ag) can be reduced by metal acetylacetonates (MAcacs) in previous works.21,22 However, the effect of MAcac CILs on the work function of PCBM appears to be neglected, and this was investigated as follows. Fig. 3c and f show the effect of the Ca(acac)2 CIL on the work function of PCBM revealed by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). The contact potential difference (CPD) of the PCBM can be largely lifted after modifying with thin layers of the Ca(acac)2 CIL. On the basis of the equation ϕpcbm = ϕt − eVsp, where ϕt is the work function of the conductive tip and Vsp is the measured surface potential determined from the surface potential profiles,21,22,41 the work function ϕpcbm for the Ca(acac)2 modified PCBM contact was determined to be ca. 0.31 eV reduced according to the surface potential profiles. Furthermore, from the UPS spectra (Fig. S4, ESI†), the work function of the Ca(acac)2 modified PCBM sample was calculated to be ca. 4.21 eV, which is identical to the effective drop of the work function from SKPM analysis. It has been reported that the reduced work function of PCBM by Ca(acac)2 CILs is induced from the dipoles formed along the interfaces,21 which may enhance the built-in potential across the device and lead to the quasi-ohmic contact between PCBM and Ag, conjunctly promoting “barrier-free” electron extraction from PCBM to the Ag cathode and consequently leading to a significantly improved PCE. Besides, an enlarged band offset between the PCBM ETL and NiOx hole transport layer (HTL) provided an increased Voc due to the presence of the Ca(acac)2 CIL.42,43
To explore the origin of the effect of the Ca(acac)2 CIL, we studied the light intensity dependence of the performance of devices with and without the Ca(acac)2 CIL. Voc characteristics (Fig. 4a) are straightforward evidence for reduced surface traps in a device. This methodology provides a diagnostic assessment of the impact of traps on recombination. Ideally, the slope (n) of the curve should be equal to kT·q−1 in the absence of trap-assisted recombination. The Vocvs. light intensity curve of the device using PCBM/Ag shows a slope of 1.68 kT·q−1, demonstrating a significant energy loss from trap-assisted recombination. After introduction of the Ca(acac)2 CIL, the slope is reduced to 1.29 kT·q−1, which is in agreement with the reduction of trap-assisted recombination. Fig. 4b shows a logarithmic plot of Jsc as a function of light intensity in the two devices.44 The slope of curve of Jscvs. light intensity is 0.984 for the device with PCBM/Ag, indicating negligible bimolecular recombination. After introduction of the Ca(acac)2 CIL, the slope value is 0.998, showing that bimolecular recombination is not significantly related to the improvement of the performance of devices prepared here. Our results indicate that changed trap-assisted recombination is dominantly attributed to trap passivation at the PCBM interface.

To gain more insights into the photophysical origins of the enhanced characteristics of the device, we measured the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) of the perovskite films. As shown in Fig. 4c, ITO/NiOx/perovskite/PCBM demonstrates higher PL intensity. Significant PL quenching was observed for the device with the Ca(acac)2 CIL. A further quenching is expected for a complete device where the charge carriers would transfer to the corresponding contacts through the charge transport layers. The utmost PL quenching was observed for the devices with Ca(acac)2 CILs, demonstrating the highest charge carrier transfer efficiency at those interfaces. This phenomenon is more clearly illustrated by the following time-resolved PL spectra. As presented in Fig. 4d. In order to evaluate the charge carrier dynamics at semiconductor interfaces, the time-resolved PL decay was further measured via monitoring the peak emission at 525 nm. Corresponding to the bi-exponential decay process, the time-resolved PL traces of ITO/NiOx/perovskite/PCBM and ITO/NiOx/perovskite/PCBM/Ca(acac)2 show a dramatic decline in emission lifetime with fitted values of 5.28 ns and 3.09 ns, respectively. It is recognized that both non-radiative recombination and energy transfer of the charge carriers were involved in the PL decay experiment, and a faster PL decay meant that a more efficient energy transfer process was involved if a constant non-radiative recombination rate was assumed.21,45–49 The PL decay comparison shows that the Ca(acac)2 based device exhibits the shortest lifetime and the fastest carrier transport to the ITO electrode, in contrast to the PCBM only sample. The shorter lifetime induced by the Ca(acac)2 CIL quenching indicates that the cathode interface modification could promote efficient charge carrier transfer at the cathode interface and lead to the performance improvement of inverted planar PSCs.
As shown in Fig. 5a, the dark current density of the PSC with Ca(acac)2 under the reverse bias is lower than that of the PSC without Ca(acac)2, suggesting that the leakage current at the PCBM/cathode is reduced via modification with Ca(acac)2. However, in the forward bias region of 0.95–1.5 V, the injected current density of PSC with Ca(acac)2 is much higher than that of PSC without Ca(acac)2, suggesting a lowered injection barrier between PCBM and the Ag cathode and consequently improved electron transport after modification with Ca(acac)2.24,50,51 Therefore, the decrease of series resistance due to the reduced leakage current and improved electron transport is confirmed, accounting for the increase of FF.

(c) Histogram of solar cell efficiencies of the control and Ca(acac)2-modified PSCs (30 devices, respectively); (d) normalized PCE of the control and Ca(acac)2-modified PSCs vs. storage time in a glove box without encapsulation. 
In light of the reduced surface trapping, it appears reasonable to expect improved capacitive properties of the modified devices. We thus measured the impedance spectra of the PSCs. Fig. 5d shows the Nyquist plots of the impedance spectra of PSCs obtained under 1 sun irradiation (bias = Voc). In this situation, the photocurrent was entirely compensated by the recombination current, leading to a net current of zero and flat band condition at which the impact of changes in recombination was more clearly examined. As such, the total resistance of solar cells was dominated by recombination resistance (Rrec). In Fig. 5d, single RC components were used to extract the relevant parameters by equivalent circuit modeling, justified by the appearance of single arc in the medium frequency regime. An equivalent circuit modeling (ECM) with single RC components can provide satisfactory fittings. Based on ECM, the series resistance (Rs) decreases from 152.5 Ω (control device) to 140 Ω (device with Ca(acac)2 layer), consistent with the improved electron extraction at the cathode interface, indicating that a more efficient charge transfer process occurred in the Ca(acac)2-modified device. Notably, Rrec increases from 64241 Ω (control device) to 84710 Ω (device with Ca(acac)2). The increase in Rrec (under 1 sun) indicates a reduced recombination under solar cell operation, which well agrees with irradiation-dependent Voc measurements showing reduced Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination. All these results lead to an enhanced Jsc and thereby an improved PCE.
The advantages of the Ca(acac)2 CIL become further apparent when comparing the PCEs of the control PSCs and the Ca(acac)2-modified PSCs (Fig. 5c). The latter show significantly higher PCEs than the former. Therefore, high-efficiency solar cells with an average PCE of >16.5% and a high degree of reproducibility could be produced by using the Ca(acac)2 CIL. This study provides an effective method for fabricating efficient and cost-effective inorganic–organic hybrid heterojunction solar cells. Meanwhile, long-term stability is an important concern for practical applications of PSCs.52–58 We also showed histograms of the corresponding PCEs for FA0.85MA0.15Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3-based PSC devices (Fig. S9, ESI†). Fig. 5d presents the room-temperature stability of the control PSC and Ca(acac)2-modified PSC. The devices were not encapsulated and stored in a glove box. The Ca(acac)2-modified PSC exhibits excellent stability beyond 30 days, while the control device shows a significantly decreased PCE. Finally, the contact angles between water and PCBM or Ca(acac)2 were measured to investigate their hydrophobicity. Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows that the contact angle between water and Ca(acac)2 is 66 deg, far larger than that between water and PCBM (39 deg). Perovskite can easily decompose in water and Ca(acac)2 is able to slow down the diffusion of water into PCBM and perovskite.
4. Conclusions
In sum, Ca(acac)2 was used as an interfacial layer for solution-processed inverted perovskite solar cells. This study found that employing Ca(acac)2 can effectively suppress hysteresis and substantially reduce SRH charge recombination, leading to the improved performance of FA0.85MA0.15Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3-based and MAPbI3-based PSC devices with PCEs up to 20.15% and 18.23%, respectively. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) was used to observe the rising of the contact potential difference for PCBM covered with Ca(acac)2, and the results imply that the electronic structure at the cathode interface was changed. Besides, Ca(acac)2 incorporation may induce the formation of a dipole layer, which may enhance the built-in potential across the device, thereby promoting electron transport from PCBM to Ag cathode and consequently leading to a significantly improved PCE. The surface trap passivation with the incorporation of Ca(acac)2 was evidenced by the reduction in Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination based on variable light intensity open-circuit voltage (Voc) measurements. Importantly, MAPbI3-based PSC devices with a Ca(acac)2 thin layer have high stability, showing merely a 15% PCE drop after 30 days of storage in a glove box. Future efforts should possibly focus on achieving more complete trap passivation to attain further enhancement of PCE. This work demonstrates an opportunity to incorporate naturally occurring Ca(acac)2 as an interface mediator to simultaneously improve the photovoltaic performance and operational stability of perovskite-based energy conversion devices.
