    , Accepted 12th December 2019First published on 19th December 2019AbstractIn this work, we present a facile and effective protocol, the in situ tetrafluoroborate modification route, to improve the photoluminescence and stability of CH3NH3PbBr3 (MAPbBr3) nanocrystals by directly introducing tetrafluoroborate salts into the precursor solutions in the LARP process. It is found that the incorporation of tetrafluoroborate can control the optical properties and morphologies of the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals. By adjusting the amount of BF4−, the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals with tunable emission (480–525 nm) and high photoluminescence are acquired. Simultaneously, the stability of the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals can also be greatly improved via in situ tetrafluoroborate modification. More interestingly, the introduction of BF4− can induce the self-assembly crystal growth behavior of the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals, which exhibit orderly alignment and oriented self-assemblies. Such amazing results are primarily ascribed to the passivation of surface defects, the presence of a stable organic–inorganic hybrid ligand layer and formation of hydrogen bonding between BF4− and MA+ upon in situ incorporation of tetrafluoroborate.
1. Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) have achieved unprecedented development in photovoltaics (PVs) because of the impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 23%.1–3 The great success in employing HOIPs in PVs has triggered numerous corresponding research studies, among which, HOIP nanocrystals have drawn worldwide attention owing to their unique merits, such as precise tunable emission, narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM), high brightness, high color purity, high defect tolerance, high absorption coefficient, facile fabrication and low cost.4–7 These advantages have enabled HOIP nanocrystals to be widely used in many fields, such as light-emitting diodes,8–10 lasers,11,12 photodetectors,13,14 memory devices,15,16 and biological applications.17
So far, various approaches have been proposed to synthesize HOIP nanocrystals, such as a template-assisted method,18–20 nontemplate solution synthesis,21,22 ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP),23 emulsion synthesis,24 a one-pot reverse micelle method,25 a top-down approach,26 spray synthesis,27 and so on. The optoelectronic properties, chemical compositions and morphologies of HOIP nanocrystals can be precisely controlled by tuning the synthesis parameters, including precursor components and ratios, reaction temperature and time, solvent properties, ligand species, postsynthetic treatment, etc.28
Despite the recent rapid progress, the stability issue of HOIP nanocrystals remains a critical challenge to be overcome. Owing to low formation energy, high ionicity of the HOIP structure, massive surface defects and quite dynamic and labile characteristic of surface ligands, HOIP nanocrystals are vulnerable to environmental stress, such as heat, light, moisture, oxygen, etc.29,30 Therefore, stability has become the primary concern for the practical applications of the HOIP nanocrystals. To improve the stability of the HOIP nanocrystals, numerous strategies have been developed, mainly including compositional engineering,31,32 surface ligand engineering,33–35 two-dimensional (2D) perovskite phase engineering36 and encapsulation.37
Currently, there is particular interest in studies of the self-assembly behavior of perovskite nanocrystals for improved or novel applications. Many investigations have pointed out that there exists the self-organization crystal growth process of perovskite nanocrystals in liquid medium. It has been observed that perovskite quantum dots can be self-assembled to form nanowires, nanoplatelets, nanorods, nanosheets, higher order superlattices or superstructures through prolonging the aging time, changing the reaction temperature and time, and using visible light or flexible polymeric ligands.38–43
Moreover, polyatomic pseudohalogen anions have been found to be able to be incorporated into the lead halide perovskites to take the place of the halogens due to their similar ionic radii.44 Among various polyatomic pseudohalogen anions, the tetrafluoroborate anion (BF4−) has received a fair amount of attention in the past several years.45 One of the first report to investigate the application of BF4− in perovskites was described by Nagane et al., who reported that the CH3NH3PbI(3−x)(BF4)x hybrid perovskite showed enhanced electrical conductivity and photoresponse.46 Then, Han et al. developed the same mixed-anion perovskite for perovskite solar cells and dramatically improved the photovoltaic performance.47 Samanta et al. demonstrated that the BF4− ion could effectively remove excess lead atom defects on the surface of all-inorganic CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) NCs by post-treatment with tetrafluoroborate salts, boosting their photoluminescence quantum yields.48 More recently, a kind of ionic liquid additive containing BF4−, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMIMBF4), was introduced into the (FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Cs0.05Pb(I0.9Br0.1)3 planar perovskite solar cells to markedly improve the device efficiency and long-term stability.49 Apparently, the BF4− pseudohalogen anion has shown great potential in further improving the properties of perovskite materials. However, the employment of BF4− in HOIP nanocrystals has not been explored.
Inspired by these results, MAPbBr3 nanocrystals with high photoluminescence and stability have been prepared by the in situ introduction of tetrafluoroborate in the precursor solutions using the LARP method. The in situ addition of tetrafluoroborate can adjust the photoluminescence properties, improve PLQYs and enhance the stability of the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals. Interestingly, induced by tetrafluoroborate, the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals show obvious self-assembly crystal growth behavior.
2. Results and discussion
The pristine MAPbBr3 nanocrystals are synthesized following the LARP technique developed by Zhang et al.23 For our in situ tetrafluoroborate modification approach, different amounts of tetrafluoroborate salts, either NH4BF4 or NaBF4 (0, 0.0225 mmol, 0.045 mmol, 0.090 mmol and 0.180 mmol), are additionally introduced into the precursor solutions containing PbBr2, MABr, oleic acid and oleylamine in DMF, as shown in Fig. 1a. For the convenience of discussion, the samples prepared with different amounts of NH4BF4 were labeled as NH4BF4-0, NH4BF4-0.5, NH4BF4-1, NH4BF4-2 and NH4BF4-4, respectively, according to the mole ratio of NH4BF4 to MABr. Similarly, the in situ NaBF4-modified samples were labeled as NaBF4-0, NaBF4-0.5, NaBF4-1, NaBF4-2 and NaBF4-4, respectively. Fig. 1b presents the optical images of the freshly prepared MAPbBr3 nanocrystal solutions synthesized with different amounts of NH4BF4 under sunlight and a 365 nm ultraviolet (UV) lamp. Under a UV lamp, the change in the photoluminescence color from blue to green for the freshly prepared MAPbBr3 nanocrystals can be clearly observed upon increasing the amount of NH4BF4 in the precursors.

To explore the influence of in situ tetrafluoroborate modification on the optical properties of the freshly prepared MAPbBr3 nanocrystals, the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption, photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra are recorded. The relevant optical characteristics are listed in Table 1. The steady-state optical absorption and PL spectra of the freshly prepared MAPbBr3 nanocrystals via the in situ NH4BF4 modification are illustrated in Fig. 2a, b and Fig. S1 (ESI†). With the amount of NH4BF4 increasing, the optical absorption and PL emission show gradual red-shift until the mole ratio of NH4BF4 to MABr is up to 1. Similar results are also observed for the in situ NaBF4-modified samples (Fig. S2, ESI†), revealing that the change in the optical properties of the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals is mainly assigned to the inclusion of tetrafluoroborate. In our experiments, tetrafluoroborate salts mainly focused on NH4BF4 and NaBF4. However, other tetrafluoroborate salts have not been conclusively excluded and may have the same effect. Observably, each sample exhibits a narrow FWHM value of the PL peak in the range of 20–27 nm, revealing a narrow particle size distribution.31 Moreover, all samples show significant blue shifts compared to the MAPbBr3 bulk, mainly due to the quantum confinement effect.21 Meanwhile, a small Stokes shift exists between the PL peak and absorption peak of each sample, consistent with the direct exciton recombination process. More notably, significant enhancement can be found in the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals. According to Fig. 2c, the PLQY of the pristine MAPbBr3 nanocrystals is only 59%. Upon introducing tetrafluoroborate salts into the precursor solutions, the PLQYs of MAPbBr3 nanocrystals evidently increase, especially for the NH4BF4-2 sample, which is increased to 91%. The increase of PLQY indicates that the nonradiative decay is reduced due to the inclusion of tetrafluoroborate. To further investigate the origins of the improved PLQYs, the TRPL decay experiments are conducted (Fig. 2d). Expressed by the bi-exponential fitting, the average PL lifetimes are 6.8 ns, 10.2 ns, 14.1 ns, 15.8 ns, and 9.6 ns for NH4BF4-0, NH4BF4-0.5, NH4BF4-1, NH4BF4-2 and NH4BF4-4, respectively. Obviously, the PL lifetime increases upon the introduction of NH4BF4. As we know, the longer PL lifetime indicates that the non-radiative recombination is suppressed and the light-generated excitons are more prone to recombination through radiative channels, inducing higher PLQY. The result is in accordance with the PLQYs obtained for the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals prepared using different amounts of NH4BF4. It is apparent that the incorporation of tetrafluoroborate can effectively increase the PL lifetime, thereby, improving the PLQYs and optical properties of the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals.

The morphologies and crystallinity of the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals are characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements (Fig. 3 and Fig. S3, S4, ESI†). It should be noted that to avoid the aggregation or recrystallization of the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals in the drying process, we apply the freeze drying method to prepare the dried samples for analyses. For the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals prepared in the absence of tetrafluoroborate salts (i.e. NH4BF4-0 sample), spherical particles with an average diameter of 4.9 ± 0.7 nm are obtained, exhibiting the monodisperse characteristics and a narrow size distribution (Fig. 3a). The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the NH4BF4-0 sample shows diffraction rings attributed to the (110) and (200) planes (inset of Fig. 3a). Fig. 3d displays the high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the pristine MAPbBr3 nanoparticles with good crystallinity, illustrating a well-defined lattice spacing of 3.01 Å, ascribed to the (200) planes of cubic MAPbBr3. When a certain amount of NH4BF4 is introduced (i.e. NH4BF4-0.5 sample), larger MAPbBr3 nanoparticles with a mean diameter of 9.92 ± 1.6 nm are acquired (Fig. 3b). Very interestingly, these nanoparticles exhibit self-assembly behavior, which spontaneously align to form a “pearl-necklace”. Meanwhile, the HRTEM image of the NH4BF4-0.5 sample shows structural features of oriented attachment (Fig. 3e) and some bright small diffraction dots are observed in the SAED pattern of such a sample (inset of Fig. 3b). With the increase of the NH4BF4 concentration, the MAPbBr3 nanoparticles gradually self-assemble to nanowires (Fig. 3 and Fig. S3, ESI†). A typical single-crystal-like feature can be observed in the SAED pattern and the HRTEM image of NH4BF4-2 (inset of Fig. 3c and f). The larger particle sizes and self-assembled nanowires will account for the red-shift observed in the UV-vis absorption and PL spectra. The morphology change from nanoparticles to nanowires is also revealed in the narrower and stronger XRD peaks in the XRD measurements with increasing NH4BF4 concentrations (Fig. S4, ESI†). In addition, no obvious XRD peak split or shift can be observed for the in situ tetrafluoroborate modified samples. The results show that the BF4− groups do not enter and alter the crystal lattice of the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals.

In the meantime, the influence of in situ NaBF4 modification on the morphologies of the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals is explored. As illustrated in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the in situ inclusion of NaBF4 can also cause the self-assembly crystal growth behavior of the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals. With the concentration of NaBF4 increasing, the MAPbBr3 nanoparticles self-assemble to form strip-shaped nanoplates, which is different from the in situ NH4BF4-modified MAPbBr3 nanocrystals. Such a difference may be considered to be due to the different role of cations.50 The investigations on the underlying mechanism are underway. Despite the difference, it is clear that the addition of tetrafluoroborate salts can also identically induce the self-assembly behavior of MAPbBr3 nanocrystals. The above observations indicate that the in situ tetrafluoroborate modification can effectively boost the optical properties and induce the self-assembly crystal growth of the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals. Such interesting results inspire us to elucidate the underlying root originating from the in situ tetrafluoroborate modification.
As we know, surface ligand chemistry plays an important role in controlling the nucleation and growth process of nanocrystals, as well as the optical properties. Therefore, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are applied to assess the surface ligand chemistry of the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals prepared using different amounts of NH4BF4. According to Fig. S6 (ESI†), the co-existence of tetrafluoroborate, oleic acid and oleylamine as surface ligands can be definitely confirmed. The peaks at 1560 cm−1, 1652 cm−1 and 1723 cm−1 indicate the existence of oleic acid and oleylamine bound to the MAPbBr3 nanocrystal surface.41,42 The broad peaks at around 1092 cm−1 are attributed to the stretching vibration peaks from the BF4− groups bound to lead, which gradually appear with the increase of the NH4BF4 amount, demonstrating that the BF4− group places at the surface of the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals.46,48 XPS analysis for the NH4BF4-0 and NH4BF4-2 samples is shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†) and Fig. 4. For the pristine MAPbBr3 nanocrystals, there is no evidence of boron and fluorine in the XPS survey scan. However, the characteristic peaks of B 1s and F 1s core electrons can be clearly observed in the XPS survey scan of the NH4BF4-2 sample (Fig. 4a and b), further proving that the BF4− groups are bonded to the surface of the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals. Based on XPS results, the Br-to-Pb atomic ratio is 3.74 for the NH4BF4-0 sample, which shows higher bromide ions at the MAPbBr3 nanocrystal surface compared to the MAPbBr3 bulk, in agreement with the literature reports.23 Following the in situ BF4− modification, the Br-to-Pb atomic ratio increases to 3.92, revealing that some Pb are removed from the surface. This removal of Pb is further verified by the deconvolution analysis of the high resolution XPS spectrum of Pb 4f (Fig. 4c). For the pristine MAPbBr3 nanocrystals, the Pb 4f peaks can be fitted into four peaks: two intense peaks with binding energies of 138.2 eV (Pb 4f7/2) and 143.1 eV (Pb 4f5/2) and two weaker peaks with binding energies of 136.5 eV and 141.2 eV. In general, the weak peaks are mainly attributed to Pb(0) in the metallic state,48 which are not found for the NH4BF4-2 sample, implying that the in situ tetrafluoroborate modification can remove the labile Pb adatoms from the nanocrystal surface. Usually, these Pb adatoms act as surface defects, which trap the charge carriers and are responsible for the poor PLQY. Removal of such Pb adatoms will be advantageous to passivate the surface, thus leading to PL improvement. Moreover, for the Br 3d, the peak at 68.2 eV corresponds to the inner Br ions and the peak at 69.2 eV is ascribed to the surface Br ions (Fig. 4d). Observably, BF4− incorporation increases the relative intensity of surface bromide ions, resulting in the surface rich in Br ions. Furthermore, the existence of hydrogen bonds between BF4− and MA+ is confirmed using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) measurements. In general, the formation of hydrogen will cause chemical shifts to low-field (high ppm) resulting from de-shielding. As illustrated in Fig. 4e, for MABr, the proton chemical shift at 7.29 ppm is ascribed to the resonance from the NH3+, which is moves to 7.33 ppm and 7.60 ppm with the introduction of equimolar NH4BF4 and NaBF4, respectively. The result verifies the formation of hydrogen bonds between BF4− and MA+. In all, the in situ BF4− modification can effectively get rid of the surface Pb adatoms and form a stable bromine-rich organic–inorganic hybrid ligand layer, which will then passivate the surface defects and help to enhance the optical properties, as well as the stability of the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals. Simultaneously, the presence of directional hydrogen bonds between BF4− and MA+ can endow the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals with the self-assembly ability to be orderly aligned and orientated.

Peaks a, b and c are characteristic of H (a), H (b) and H (c) as labelled in the molecular structure in the inset. 
Finally, we conduct the long-term stability tests for MAPbBr3 nanocrystals prepared using different amounts of NH4BF4 in open air (T: 25–30 °C, relative humidity (RH): 50–60%). According to Fig. 5a and b, the in situ incorporation of tetrafluoroborate can greatly improve the stability of the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals. With the storage time prolonging, the PL intensity of the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals prepared without NH4BF4 gradually weakens and completely disappears after 35 days. However, when NH4BF4 is introduced into the precursor solutions, the decline tendency of PL intensity slows down. In particular for the NH4BF4-2 and NH4BF4-4 samples, the relative PL intensity remains almost 80% after 35 days. The stability of the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals prepared with different amounts of NaBF4 is also studied. Clearly, the in situ NaBF4-modified MAPbBr3 nanocrystals exhibit improved stability (Fig. S8, ESI†).

(b) The relative PL intensity variation of the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals prepared using different amounts of NH4BF4 as a function of the storage time in open air. (c) Proposed representation of in situ tetrafluoroborate modification for the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals. 
Based on our observations and analysis, we hypothesize that the BF4− groups are prerequisite for such amazing experimental phenomena and the proposed representation of in situ tetrafluoroborate modification for the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals is shown in Fig. 5c. When tetrafluoroborate is added into the precursor solutions in the LARP process, the BF4− groups will bond to the surface of the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals during the nucleation process, forming an organic–inorganic hybrid passivation ligand layer with oleic acid and oleylamine. It is known that the BF4− group has a tetrahedral structure containing four symmetric fluorine atoms. Compared with other halides, fluorine possesses higher electro-negativity and stronger electron-withdrawing ability, which can not only form the directional hydrogen bonding between BF4− and CH3NH3+, but also generate a strong dipole moment-induced-field.51 According to the classical Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (DLVO) theory, the van der Waals force and electrostatic interaction dominate the self-assembly behavior of nanocrystals. In the case of the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals, the main driving force is believed to be the dipole–dipole interaction.38 Therefore, upon inclusion of BF4−, the dipolar potential field, combined with the directional hydrogen bonding, will render the oriented attachment of MAPbBr3 nanocrystals. With a further increase of BF4− concentration, the oriented attachment of the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals will fuse to ordered self-assemblies. At the same time, the formation of the organic–inorganic hybrid passivation ligand layer will not only passivate the surface defects, but also weaken the dynamic and labile nature of oleic acid and oleylamine ligands, protecting the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals from degrading. Taken together, the in situ BF4− modification can endow the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals with improved PL emission, enhanced stability and self-assembled crystal growth, which showcase the promising applications in lighting and displays.
Preliminarily, we demonstrate the potential application of tetrafluoroborate-modified MAPbBr3 nanocrystals as phosphors in lighting technology. For acquiring white light, the green-emissive NH4BF4-2 sample with high PLQY and good stability is chosen. White light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) are designed and prepared by coating green emissive MAPbBr3 nanocrystals and red emissive CaAlSiN3:Eu2+ (CASNE) phosphors on a blue-emitting InGaN chip, which are encapsulated with epoxy resins. We have adjusted the R/G/B color composition ratio to obtain a strong white emission LED (inset of Fig. 6a). Fig. 6a exhibits the typical electroluminescence (EL) spectra of the as-fabricated WLED at a driving current of 10 mA. Three distinct emission bands at 460, 525, and 640 nm can be observed, which are ascribed to the luminescence from the blue InGaN chip, green MAPbBr3 nanocrystals and red nitride phosphor, respectively. Fig. 6b depicts the Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE1931) color coordinates of the device. The CIE coordinates of (0.3468, 0.3474) and a relative correlated color temperature (CCT) value of 4987 K are acquired, corresponding to the excellent warm white light emission. Moreover, the WLED device exhibits good optoelectronic properties, and the power efficiency (PE) reaches 48.3 lm W−1 at a current of 10 mA. EL intensity–time dependence is shown in Fig. 6c. It can be observed that the EL intensity of the WLED degrades only slightly. The results show that the tetrafluoroborate-modified MAPbBr3 nanocrystals can function as the efficient phosphor for the WLED application.

3. Conclusions
In conclusion, a facile and effective in situ tetrafluoroborate modification protocol has been developed to synthesize the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals showing high photoluminescence, improved stability and self-assembly behavior. Our in situ approach directly introduces the tetrafluoroborate salts into the precursor solutions of MAPbBr3 nanocrystals in the LARP process. The in situ incorporation of BF4− groups can effectively remove the labile surface Pb adatoms, passivate surface defects and form the stable organic–inorganic hybrid ligand layers, boosting the photoluminescence and stability of the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals. More remarkably, owing to the high electro-negativity and strong electron-withdrawing ability of fluorine in BF4− groups, the in situ BF4− modified MAPbBr3 nanocrystals show self-assembly crystal growth behavior. Given these interesting properties possessed by the in situ tetrafluoroborate modification, such MAPbBr3 nanocrystals will hold great promise for enhancing the device performance.
