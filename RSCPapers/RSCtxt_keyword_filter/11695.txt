    , Accepted 15th August 2020First published on 18th August 2020AbstractTo solve energy crisis, the engineering of highly efficient and cost-effective photoanodes is urgently required for clean fuel generation. Herein, CdSe(en)0.5 (en = ethylenediamine) hybrid photoanodes were synthesized by a solvothermal approach. It was revealed that a second in situ hydrothermal treatment successfully converts cadmium foil-based inorganic–organic CdSe(en)0.5 (en = ethylenediamine) hybrid nanosheets to an oriented cadmium hydroxide crowned CdSe nanowire-decorated porous nanosheet (Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS) heterostructure by dissolution and regrowth mechanisms. The alteration in second hydrothermal reaction conditions could modify the morphology and optical properties of the Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS heterostructure photoanodes. The possible growth mechanism of the Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS porous structure is studied at various second hydrothermal times using the control experiments of the synthesis. The optimized 3D porous Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS photoanodes exhibited an outstanding photocurrent density of 6.1 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which is approximately 7.6 times higher than that of the inorganic–organic CdSe(en)0.5 hybrid under light irradiation (>420 nm cut off filter). A mechanism is proposed to explain the enhanced charge separation at the Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS photoanode/electrolyte interface, which is supported by PL and photoelectrochemical analyses. These findings open an avenue of phase and morphology transmutation for efficient formation of other hierarchical structures of metal selenides and sulfides. Additionally, the Al2O3 co-catalyst can act as effective hole trapping sites and improves the stability of the photoelectrode through the timely consumption of photogenerated charges, particularly holes.
Introduction
The development of efficient energy conversion systems has become an urgent requirement to solve global energy problems and meet the needs of the environment and modern society. Hydrogen (H2), an attractive sustainable clean energy source, is one of the potential answers to the global energy crisis and environmental pollution.1 There has been significant interest in utilization of H2S which is generated as byproducts in hydrogenation and flue-gas desulfurization processes at chemical plants for H2 generation.2 Photocatalytic H2 production using semiconductor photoelectrodes has become a promising, green and sustainable route for solar-to-chemical energy conversion.3 To date, numerous approaches have been reported to synthesize photocatalyst nanoparticles with desirable and controlled morphologies.4 However, effective light absorption and efficient charge transfer capability are the key factors for the advancement of photocatalytic conversion efficiency of the photocatalyst material.5 Recently, great interest has been focused on metal chalcogenides such as CdSe and CdTe because of their moderate band gap, appropriate band structure, and high extinction coefficient, which offer them good visible-light driven photocatalytic activities in the presence of sacrificial reagents.6 There are many reports on the synthesis of CdSe in powder forms,7–9 which might be due to difficulties in controlling the nucleation and growth of CdSe for the fabrication of well-defined nanostructures. However, much effort has been devoted to the synthesis route, which has a direct impact on the size, composition and features of the obtained nanostructures.10,11 Compared with these metal chalcogenide semiconductors, recently, the family of II–VI-based inorganic–organic lamellar-type hybrid materials, AIIBVI(en)0.5 (A = Cd, Zn; B = S, Se, Te; en = ethylenediamine), have attracted great attention because of advantageous characteristics of both organic and inorganic parts.12 Additionally, inorganic–organic hybrids are composed of double-layered slabs and organic monoamine spacers. The presence of organic spacers prevents interactions among the adjacent inorganic counterparts, thus inducing strong quantum confinement.13 Also, the AIIBVI(en)0.5 have a unique feature of tunable functionality through the modification of the molecular or monomer structures of polymers of organic-based devices.14,15 By taking advantage of both the superior intrinsic carrier mobilities and broad-band absorption of inorganic-based devices, different photocatalysts such as polymers combined with inorganic components such as ZnO16 and Cu2ZnSnSe417 have been developed. It was reported that ultrathin semiconductor inorganic 2D slabs are intercalated with organic diamines in these materials.18 In particular, because of its linear molecular structure and the existence of amino groups, ethylenediamine has been widely used in the synthesis of CdS nanowires19 and PbS nanostructures.20 Huang et al. designed and engineered a new group of two-dimensional crystalline [(MIIQII)(L)] nanostructures (where M = Zn, Cd; Q = S, Se; and L = ethylamine, n-propylamine, n-butylamine, n-amylamine, n-hexylamine) to systematically tailor the structures and properties of II–VI semiconductor based inorganic–organic hybrid nanostructured materials.21 Deng et al. reported a novel class of inorganic–organic-layered structures, CdE·0.5en (E = S, Se, Te; en = ethylenediamine) through the solvothermal treatment of precursors. The crystal structures, incorporating inorganic slabs and organic-bridged molecules of inorganic–organic hybrid structures, were studied in detail using structural characterization.22 Huang et al. also designed and synthesized a family of novel organic–inorganic hybrid nanocomposites with various structures and dimensional frameworks. They reported that all the nanostructures exhibit a strong quantum confinement effect (QCE), while possessing a perfectly periodic arrangement.14 Li et al. also reported layered inorganic/organic hybrid (CdSe)n·monoamine nanobelts via controllable solvothermal synthesis, multiple stage amine de-intercalation transformation, and two-dimensional exciton quantum confinement effects.23 Even though the amine mediated 2D inorganic–organic sulfide and selenide powdered structures were synthesized in a few studies,16,17 thus far, there has been no report on the development of hierarchical oriented porous CdSe NW/NS photoanodes on the cadmium foil substrate from inorganic–organic hybrids for photoelectrochemical (PEC) application. Thus, the development of stable and efficient hierarchical photoanodes from the 2D inorganic–organic metal selenides for the energy harvesting application using a facile and universal approach is still in its launching stage.
Herein, for the first time we report a facile chemical conversion route for the selective in situ synthesis of the self-assembled porous CdSe nanowire/nanosheet (CdSe NW/NS) structure from cadmium-foil based inorganic–organic CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheets. We focus on understanding the structure and morphology transformation mechanism of inorganic–organic CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheets into an oriented hierarchical porous CdSe NW/NS photoanode during the in situ hydrothermal growth. The obtained porous CdSe NW/NS heterostructure photoanodes simultaneously contained the presence of nonuniform Cd(OH)2 on the surface and leaching out of (en)0.5 during the second hydrothermal reaction. Cd(OH)2 not only acts as a mediator for the in situ surface transformation of Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS photoanodes to CdS/CdSe NW/NS but also acts as a surface passivator during photoelectrochemical measurement. Additionally, CdSe nanowires in the Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS heterostructure also act as conductive bridges between the porous CdSe nanosheets and facilitate the migration of photogenerated electrons between the porous CdSe NS and conducting substrate. The resulting optimum Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS heterostructure exhibits an outstanding photocurrent density of 6.1 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which is approximately 7.6 times higher than that of CdSe(en)0.5 (0.8 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl). The charge transfer mechanism and role of Cd(OH)2 during the photoelectrochemical performance of the Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS porous structure were well discussed. Finally, attempts have been made to improve the photoelectrochemical stability of optimum Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS structures via Al2O3 passivation layers. This “bottom-up” approach of organic–inorganic transformation and integration of nanostructures will open a novel route for formation of photoanode materials for photoelectrochemical devices.
Experimental
Synthesis of CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheets on the Cd foil
The CdSe(en)0.5 complex nanosheets were grown on Cd substrates (Cd foil with 1 mm thickness and 99.6% purity) by a facile solvothermal method. Before deposition, the oxide layer on the surface of the Cd foil was carefully removed by mechanical scrapping followed by 20 min of ultrasonication in ethyl alcohol and then dried thoroughly. Furthermore, 0.1 gram of Se powder was mixed with 50 mL ethylenediamine solution followed by 5 min ultrasonication and vigorous stirring for 30 min. The Cd foils were then inserted vertically into Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclaves. The autoclaves were sealed and enclosed in an electric oven at a constant temperature of 140 °C for 12 h. Furthermore, the as-obtained CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheets were washed several times with double distilled water and then kept in ethyl alcohol solution (SAMCHUN, 94.5%) for 5 h.
Transformation of CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheets into a three-dimensional (3D) porous CdSe nanosheet/nanowire hybrid structure
The 3D porous CdSe nanosheet/nanowire (CdSe-NW/NS) hybrid structure was formed from the CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheet/Cd foil via second hydrothermal treatment at various time intervals of 3 h, 6 h, and 12 h at 160 °C. After naturally cooling down to room temperature, black porous CdSe-NW/NS films formed on the Cd foil, which were washed thoroughly with deionized water, and then dried under vacuum at 100 °C for 6 h. Furthermore, Al2O3 was deposited on 3D porous Cd(OH)2/CdSe NS/NW photoanodes using the dip coating technique at room temperature. The amount of the protective aluminium oxide layer could be controlled by adjusting the Al(Cl3)3 (Al precursor) concentration to 5 mM, 10 mM and 20 mM, respectively in the ethanol (oxygen precursor) with a 2 min dipping time. Furthermore, the samples were dried under nitrogen gas flow and were quenched at 250 °C, for 15 min in a box furnace. These Al precursor treated Cd(OH)2/CdSe NS/NW photoanodes were further termed 5 mM Al, 10 mM Al, and 15 mM Al, respectively and the untreated sample is termed 0 mM Al.
Characterization
The morphological studies of the deposited films were conducted using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) (SUPRA 40VP, Carl Zeiss, Germany) equipped with an X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the deposited metal–oxide-coated ZT was performed using a PANalytical X'pert Pro diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source (wavelength Kα1 = 1.540598 Å, and Kα2 = 1.544426 Å) in the range of 20–80° and the spectra were recorded at a scan rate of 0.02° s−1. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a JEOL ARM-200F transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV. The sample for TEM was prepared by placing a drop of sample suspension in ethanol on a standard carbon-coated copper grid. The spectra obtained by ultraviolet–visible–diffuse-reflection-spectroscopy (UV–Vis–DRS) were recorded using a dual-beam spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-2600 series) in the wavelength range of 300–800 nm. Fourier-transform infrared spectra (FTIR) were recorded on a Paragon 1000 spectrometer (PerkinElmer) with a signal resolution of 1 cm−1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine the chemical state and for elemental quantification. XPS analysis was performed using a PHI Quantera II, which is an XPS spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.6 eV). Time-resolved PL and imaging study were performed using a confocal microscope (MicroTime-200, PicoQuant, Germany) with a super-apochromat objective (UPLSAPO 40×). A pulsed diode laser (379 nm with a 30 ps pulse width) was used as an excitation source, and emission photons were detected using an avalanche photodiode (PDM series, MPD) and a time-correlated single photon counting system (PicoHarp 300, PicoQuant GmbH, Germany). The steady-state PL spectrum was measured by guiding emission photons from samples to an attached spectrometer (F-7000, Hitachi) under 379 nm laser excitation. The details of the instrumental setup are well described elsewhere.24,25
Photoelectrochemical measurements
PEC measurements of the CdSe(en)0.5 based electrodes were performed using a conventional three-electrode configuration with CdSe(en)0.5 based on the Cd-foil-based photoanode, Pt wire (0.1 cm × 10 cm), and Ag/AgCl electrodes used as the working electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode, respectively. The working electrode was illuminated from the front side using visible light (>420 nm) illumination (100 mW cm−2) that was calibrated prior to the PEC test using a Si photodiode. An electrochemical workstation (CompactStat.e20250, IVIUM) is used to record the J–V curves, to perform chronoamperometry and to measure incident-photon-to current conversion efficiency (IPCE). All the potentials refer to the saturated Ag/AgCl unless otherwise stated. Linear sweep voltammetry curves were obtained at a scanning rate of 20 mV s−1 ranging from −1.2 to 0.7 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) under Xe lamp (λ > 420 nm) illumination. An aqueous solution containing 0.1 M Na2S/0.02 M Na2SO3 was used as an electrolyte (pH ≈ 12.8) in an air-tight three-electrode PEC cell. The chronoamperometry analysis studies were performed at an applied bias of 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured using a potentiostatic mode with an ac voltage amplitude of 10 mV and a frequency range of (0.1–300) kHz under Xe lamp (λ > 420 nm) illumination. The resulting data are fitted using Zview software. The Mott–Schottky (MS) plots of the samples were collected from −1.2 to 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl at a frequency of 100 Hz in the dark. The carrier density (ND) was estimated using the following equation:26 ND = (2/eεε0)[d(1/C2)dV]−1(1)where e is the electron charge (1.602 × 10−19 C), ε is the dielectric constant of CdSe (5.8), ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum (8.854 × 10−12 F m−1), and C is the capacitance derived from the electrochemical impedance obtained at each potential (V). The IPCE is measured using a CS130 monochromator (Mmac-200, spectro) with a 300 W Xe arc lamp in the range from 300 nm to 800 nm at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The IPCE data were calculated using the following equation:27 IPCE = (1240 × Jphoto (mA cm−2))/(Iinc (mW cm−2) × λ (nm))(2)where Jphoto is the photocurrent density at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, Iinc is the incident monochromatic light power density and λ is the wavelength respectively. The photocurrent density data for IPCE were measured in an applied potential window of −0.6 to 0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl at a chopping frequency of 1000 Hz.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1A shows that the CdSe(en)0.5 photoanodes consist of nanosheets with smooth and flat surfaces, a diameter of 150–345 nm, and a length of approximately 9 μm. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of a sample synthesized at 140 °C displayed the presence of a strong peak at 2θ = 10.68°, which may be attributed to the CdSe(en)0.5 (Fig. 1B). Also, other major diffraction peaks at 2θ = 16.4°, 25.1°, and 44.0° exhibit great similarity to the experimental diffraction data of CdSe(en)0.5, as reported by Deng et al.22 Further, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image clearly reveals that the CdSe(en)0.5 sample consists of nanosheets with smooth and flat surfaces and diameters of 135–348 nm (Fig. 1C). Formation of nanosheet-like morphology is reasonable due to the layered structures. In addition, high-resolution (HR) TEM images show the presence of lattice fringes with some grain boundaries (Fig. 1(D)). The SAED pattern as shown in the inset of Fig. 1D further confirms the polycrystalline nature of CdSe(en)0.5 NS. The chemical composition of CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheet samples was further confirmed by EDS mapping (Fig. 1(E–I)) collected from the nanosheet within the rectangular region marked in Fig. 1E. The Cd, Se, C, and N elements were evenly distributed throughout the whole nanosheet, suggesting a uniform microstructure. Thus, TEM-EDS confirms that the presence of the Cd, Se, C, and N elements was mainly from the CdSe(en)0.5 hybrid.

Fig. 2(A–C) show FESEM images of CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheets after the second hydrothermal deposition for various times (3, 6 and 12 h, respectively) at 160 °C. The local structural variations of the sample prepared after 3 h hydrothermal treatment of CdSe(en)0.5 could also clearly show that the surface of CdSe nanosheets is covered with a thin mesh of nanowires. It is interesting to note that after the second hydrothermal treatment of CdSe(en)0.5, a strongly interconnected nanowire network-like structure between the CdSe nanosheets was formed. The network-like structure is not restricted to only the top but also extends to the bottom region of the nanosheets, as evidenced by the cross-sectional FESEM images (Fig. S1†). This provides an enlarged surface area for making contact between the electrode and electrolyte. Also the network structure could be helpful for efficient incident light absorption and improvement of photoelectrochemical performance. The formation of CdSe nanowires during the second hydrothermal treatment may be due to dissolution of the CdSe(en)0.5 structure and partial release of the (en)0.5 molecules between the layers of the CdSe(en)0.5 hybrid precursors. Additionally, Fig. S1† shows that the CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheets before and after the second hydrothermal treatment were almost vertically grown on the surfaces of the Cd substrate with the average length of nanosheets decreasing from 9.1 μm to 5.7 μm. To gain more insight into the morphology and lattice structure of CdSe nanosheets obtained after the second hydrothermal treatment of CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheets at 160 °C for 6 h, the TEM analysis was used. After the second hydrothermal treatment, some nanowires formed on the surface of porous CdSe nanosheets, as shown in Fig. 2D. It is clearly seen that the CdSe nanosheets are made up of small particles; the sizes determined using Image J software were ∼15–20 nm. Packed particles appear to be attached together by forming a net-like structure in the nanosheets; however, many bright regions with pores of size <18 nm were observed, demonstrating porous nature and a high surface-to-volume ratio of the single nanosheet.28 The HRTEM image (Fig. 2E) reveals that the lattice fringes with a distance of 0.34 nm matched well with the d-spacing of the (111) plane of CdSe (JCPDS No. 98-062-0436). Fig. 2F shows the HRTEM image of the red marked region in Fig. 2D, with a fringe width of 0.47 nm corresponding to the (001) peaks of hexagonal Cd(OH)2 (JCPDS No. 98-002-3415). The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern in Fig. 2F (inset) recorded for the Cd(OH)2 decorated CdSe nanowire indicates that the Cd(OH)2 is a single crystal of hexagonal phase. Similar results were reported by Zhang et al.29Fig. 2(G–I) and Fig. S2(a–c)† confirm the uniform distribution of Cd, Se, N, C, and O in the porous CdSe nanosheets formed after the second hydrothermal treatment of CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheets at 160 °C for 6 h. Furthermore, the EDS spectrum (Fig. S2d and e†) shows the elemental composition (wt% and at%) of Cd, Se, N, C and O elements of the porous CdSe nanosheets confirming the absence of unexpected impurities. A detailed chemical analysis of Cd(OH)2 present on the surface of porous CdSe nanosheets/nanowires was carried out through EDS measurement and elemental mapping. Fig. S3(a and b)† show the TEM image and EDS spectrum of Cd(OH)2-decorated CdSe nanosheet/nanowires (Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS). The absence of nitrogen (N) from the table in the inset of Fig. S3(b)† also confirms the transformation of CdSe(en)0.5 to porous CdSe NW/NS in the sample. The corresponding EDS mapping in Fig. S3(c–f)† demonstrates the discontinuous distribution of Cd, Se, and O elements, revealing the non-homogeneity of Cd(OH)2 across the CdSe NW/NS structure. A schematic illustration of the transformation of CdSe(en)0.5 to Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NSs is presented in Fig. 2J. The comparative XRD patterns of CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheets and CdSe NW/NSs obtained at 160 °C for 3, 6 and 12 h are shown in Fig. 3(A). As the hydrothermal time increases from 3 h to 12 h, the CdSe(en)0.5 peak intensity diminishes at the cost of formation of diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 23.8°, 25.39°, 27.09°, 35.13°, 41.99°, 45.81°, and 63.88°, which correspond to the (010), (002), (011), (012), (110), (013), and (023) planes of the cubic phase of CdSe (JCPDS no. 98-062-0436). Besides the cubic phase of CdSe and the CdSe(en)0.5 hybrid,18 the XRD patterns in the second hydrothermally treated CdSe sample (Fig. 3(A,c)) at 2θ values of 18.85°, 29.47°, 35.22°, 38.25°, 52.26°, and 56.0° are attributed to the (001), (010), (011), (002), (012), (110), and (111) peaks of hexagonal Cd(OH)2 (JCPDS No. 98-002-3415), respectively. Also, as the hydrothermal time increases from 6 h to 12 h the crystallinity of samples increases. This confirms the nonuniform growth of Cd(OH)2 over CdSe NW/NSs after the second hydrothermal treatment, with the presence of trace amounts of CdSe(en)0.5 in the optimized sample prepared at 6 h.30 Thus, Cd(OH)2 nanowires are present on the surface as well as in the spaces between porous CdSe nanosheets, as suggested by FESEM images, TEM images, and XRD. Such porous structure can be one of the promising candidates for the penetration of electrolytes into the high surface of CdSe NW/NR to achieve rapid charge transfer reactions owing to the short ion diffusion paths.31 The surface properties and functional groups on the surface of CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheets before and after the second hydrothermal synthesis were studied by recording the FTIR spectra in the range of 4000–500 cm−1, as shown in Fig. 3(B). The FTIR spectra of CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheets show stretching bands at 3250, 3205, 3124, and 2939–2863 cm−1, which are associated with C–H stretching. The peaks at 1574 and 1117 cm−1 are associated with H–N–H stretching, whereas those at 1364 and 1022 cm−1 are associated with H–C–H, C–N stretching. The results agree with the FTIR data on CdSe(en)0.5 reported by Deng et al.22 A broad absorption band from 3616–2734 cm−1 after the second hydrothermal treatment (Fig. 3B(b–d)) of CdSe(en)0.5 was assigned to the OH-stretching vibrations of the hydroxyl group in Cd(OH)2 and/or the N–H vibration possibly due to uncondensed diamine groups.32,33 The broad band at approximately 1383–1478 cm−1 increases from 3 h to 12 h, corresponding to the asymmetric stretching vibrations of H2O molecules, which are related to the prepared Cd(OH)2.34 However, the broad and sharp absorption band at 600–755 cm−1 can be also assigned to C–H stretching vibrations of residual organic components after the second hydrothermal treatment of CdSe(en)0.5.35 The bands at the lower wave numbers 445 and 413 cm−1 can be assigned to Cd(OH)2.35,36 Thus, FTIR analysis confirms that the increase of the second hydrothermal treatment time from 3 h to 12 h led to more transformation of CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheets into Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS porous photoanodes. Furthermore, optical diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded at room temperature with a dual-beam spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-2600 series) in the wavelength range of 300–800 nm. The diffuse reflectance spectra were transformed by applying the Kubelka–Munk transformation equation,15F(R) = (1 − R)2/2R = k/s, where R is the reflectance, k is the Kubelka–Munk absorption, and s is the scattering coefficient. Fig. S4† shows that after the second hydrothermal treatment of CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheets, the absorption edge extensively shifted towards the higher wavelength region. The absorption edges of the CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheets and CdSe NW/NS electrodes appeared at approximately 368 and 688 nm, respectively (Fig. S4(A)†). The band gap energy values were estimated from a plot of [F(R)hv]2vs. photon energy (hv).37 Furthermore, the bandgap energies obtained for CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheets and optimum CdSe NW/NSs
grown on the Cd substrate at 160 °C for 6 h are 3.49 eV and 1.8–2.02 eV, respectively (Fig. S4B†). The decreased band gap in the second hydrothermal treatment of CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheets could be attributed to the leaching out of ethylenimine from CdSe(en)0.5 and the presence of Cd(OH)2 as well as rearrangement and growth of the crystal domains of CdSe from CdSe(en)0.5. This leads to structural modification and tailoring and precise modification of electronic and optical properties of the second hydrothermally treated CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheets.38,39

Based on the above experimental results, we propose a detailed growth mechanism for Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS architectures, as shown in Fig. S5.† Ethylenediamine is known to possess strong chelating capability with metal ions and forms [2Cd(en)0.5]2+. However, during the solvothermal reaction at 140 °C, the selenium powder (Se) was reduced by the N2H4 group of ethylenediamine to obtain Se2− ions, as shown in eqn (3) and (4).40 Thus, ethylenediamine combined with metal salts (Cd ions) as well as Se. This process is the initial step in the development of CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheets (eqn (5)) and is similar to that which occurs when sulfur is activated by amines or hydroxide.41 Cd2+ + 2(en)0.5 ↔ [Cd(en)(0.5)2]2+(3) 2Se + N2H4 + 4OH− → 2Se2− + N2↑ + 4H2O(4) [Cd(en)(0.5)2]2+ + Se2− → CdSe(en)0.5(5)
In the second step, as the reaction temperature increased, ethylenediamine dissolved gradually into water from the CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheets, which could occur because ethylenediamine is a strongly alkaline liquid (boiling point = 116 °C). However, due to leaching out of ethylenediamine, the outer surface of the CdSe(en)0.5 starts to transform into CdSe. At the same time, the growth and nucleation of Cd(OH)2 nanoparticles were initiated via a dissolution–recrystallization process (Fig. S5(a)†). Here, ethylenediamine may act as the OH− source through gradual thermohydrolysis and the slow release of the OH− ions is very important for preparing the Cd(OH)2 and controlling the nucleation rate.42 A similar process was reported by Wu et al. for the dissolution–recrystallization process of ZnSe microspheres from the DETA hybrid.43 Therefore, during the second hydrothermal treatment of CdSe(en)0.5 at 160 °C, the (en)0.5 molecules could not favourably interact with the Cd2+ and Se2− ions, and therefore (en)0.5 easily dissolves in water (hydrothermal solvent, Fig. S5(b)†) which led to the porous CdSe nanosheets. Then, some of the Cd2+ in contact with the water reacted with OH− in aqueous solution at 160 °C, and nucleated to form Cd(OH)2 nanoparticles. Thus, in the hydrothermal process, the Cd(OH)2 nanoparticles recrystallized and formed through a dissolution–formation process.43,44 Similarly, CdSe(en)0.5 also formed the Cd(OH)2 layer on the surface of CdSe as follows: CdSe(en)0.5 + 2H2O → CdSe + (en)0.5 + Cd(OH)2(6) Cd2+ + 2H2O → Cd(OH)2 + 2H+(7)
More details on the Cd(OH)2 decorated porous CdSe NW/NS were studied by XPS spectroscopy (Fig. 4). Fig. 4A shows the presence of two distinct Cd 3d3/2 and Cd 3d5/2 peaks in CdSe(en)0.5 at binding energies (B.E.) of 411.3 eV and 404.7 eV corresponding to the states of Cd2+, while changes in the BE of Cd 3d of Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS (peaks at 411.1 eV and 404.27 eV) are attributed to Cd 3d3/2, which demonstrates the Cd2+ state bound with 2(OH)−, like Cd(OH)245 and CdSe.46 The presence of a broad Se 3d peak of CdSe(en)0.5 is ascribed to Cd–Se-(en)0.5 bonding and a trace amount of Se0. On the other hand, two distinct peaks centered at 53.9 and 54.8 eV in Fig. 4(B) are associated with Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2, which may be attributed to the Se2− in Cd–Se bonds of Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS,47 In addition, the presence of the regional spectrum of N 1s for CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheets and porous CdSe nanowire-decorated CdSe nanosheets seen in Fig. 4C could be attributed to C–NC.22,28 However, the N 1s XPS peak clearly decreased for the porous Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS than the CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheets, indicating the removal of (en)0.5 during the second hydrothermal treatment. The presence of the O 1s spectrum at binding energies of 531.1–531.3 eV, deconvoluted into two peaks with B.E. at 531.4 and 532.1 eV which confirms the (–OH) and O2− oxidation state to form Cd(OH)2 and surface adsorbed water, respectively, reveals the presence of hydroxide oxygen (Fig. 4(D)).45 This confirms the formation of Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS after the second hydrothermal treatment of CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheets.

To understand the impact of second hydrothermal treatment, the photocurrent performances of CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheets and Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS photoanodes were measured and compared in 0.1 M Na2S/0.02 M Na2SO3 (pH ∼12.8) under visible light (>420 nm) illumination (100 mW cm−2). Fig. 5A clearly reveals that the J–V curves of Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS photoanodes prepared at 6 h exhibit an obviously enhanced photocurrent density (6.1 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl), which is about 7.6 times larger than that of CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheets (0.8 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl), respectively. The relatively lower photocurrent in CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheets is because of less light absorption (than 380 nm) and more grain boundaries, whereas the higher values of Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS after the second hydrothermal treatment are due to high surface area porous photoanodes and transformation of Cd(OH)2 to CdS during PEC measurements, which promotes the separation of photogenerated electrons–hole pairs.48 However, photoelectrodes synthesized for 3 h and 12 h exhibited lower photocurrent density than those prepared for 6 h.

The inset of (F) is the PL lifetime images. 
This is attributed to the fact that at a lower amount of surface Cd(OH)2, less of the surface of Cd(OH)2 is transformed during PEC and longer hydrothermal treatment peeled-off the Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS from the substrate. Fig. 5B shows that the prompt regeneration of photocurrents with a reproducible response over five on/off cycles of light illumination revealed the enhanced separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs in CdS transformed Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS by the water oxidation process.49 Incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) shows the direct correlation between the light harvesting and the photocurrent of photoanodes. It was found that the IPCE of CdSe(en)0.5 at 360 nm was 5%, while Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS shows increased IPCE, reaching 39% (Fig. 5C). This can be due to effective light conversion of porous Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS and transformation of Cd(OH)2 into CdS via ion exchange reactions with sulfide ions (S2−) during the PEC measurement. The schematic of the probable in situ ion-by-ion exchange mechanism in Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS photoanodes during the PEC measurements is shown in Fig. S6.† Furthermore, to understand the effect of the second hydrothermal treatment on the charge-transfer property of CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheets, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed. The Nyquist plots of the EIS spectra of Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS's synthesized at 160 °C for 6 h show a much smaller semicircle diameter than those of the pristine CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheet structure, indicating that the Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS has a relatively smaller charge-transfer resistance under visible light irradiation (Fig. S7†). An equivalent circuit model was used to fit the EIS analysis results that consist of the series resistance (Rs) which mainly includes the sheet resistance of the substrate and resistance of external electronic circuit, the bulk charge-trapping resistance (R1), the lumped capacitance of the space-charge layer and the Helmholtz layer (CPE1), and the charge-transfer resistance. R2 and CPE2 denote the charge transfer resistance and the double layer capacitance of the CdSe(en)0.5 based photoanode and the electrolyte interface. As shown in Table 1, R1 is lower than R2, which indicates that the formation of Schottky junctions between CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheets and Cd foil could facilitate the separation of photoinduced charge carriers and interfacial transfer of electrons. When the second hydrothermal treatment time increased, the R1 values also decreased from 1322 to 75.82 Ω, indicating that the conductivity of the Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS heterostructure obtained from CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheets is enhanced owing to the severe structural transformation and regrowth. During the transformation process, CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheets split into a number of CdSe nanowires, which led to the formation of conductive channels in photoanodes, which is further attributed to reduction of the recombination of photoexcited electrons and holes in hybrid photoanodes. On the other hand, as the second hydrothermal treatment time increased from 0 to 6 h, the R2 of the as-prepared CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheets decreased substantially from 1505 to 370.4 Ω owing to the increase in the generation and transfer of charge carriers by Cd(OH)2 and CdSe nanowire/nanosheet coupling. However, as the second hydrothermal treatment time increased from 6 h to 12 h, the R2 increased again to 1251 Ω. This indicates that the serious splitting of the CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheet photoanode by the long second hydrothermal treatment time (12 h) led to reduction of the mobility of charge carriers. Thus, optimum CdSe NW/NSs synthesized for 6 h imply the increased separation efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and fast interface charge transfer, which is in accordance with the J–V curves. Fig. 5D shows the IMPS plots of CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheets and porous Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NSs grown on the Cd substrate. The electron transport time (τd) of photoanodes can be estimated using the following formula:50 τd = 1/(2πfmin)(8)where fmin represents the frequency at the minimum imaginary component in the IMPS. The average electron transport times (τd) for CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheets and Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NSs grown on the Cd substrate are 0.0026 s and 0.00053 s, respectively. This means that the Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS photoanode exhibits a shorter electron transport time compared with that of the CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheet photoanode which strongly agrees with the EIS results. Mott–Schottky analysis was used to determine the conductivity type, flat band potential and the carrier density of the CdSe(en)0.5 based photoanodes. Both the CdSe(en)0.5 and optimum Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS heterojunction photoelectrodes are n-type semiconductors because of the positive slopes of the C−2–V plots (Fig. S8†).51 The flat band potential is found to be −0.86 V and −0.93 V for the CdSe(en)0.5 and Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS, respectively. The more negative the value of flat band potential, the better the ability of the photoanode materials to facilitate the charge separation in PEC application.52 The calculated values of the carrier densities for optimum CdSe(en)0.5 and Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS photoanodes prepared at 6 h were 1.09 × 1019, and 2.52 × 1019 cm−3, respectively. Increasing their donor density led to improving the photoelectrochemical performance of the optimum Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS photoanode. The surface morphology of Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NSs after PEC measurements is shown in Fig. S9.† Also, as shown in Fig. S10(a and b)† there is not much difference in the XRD pattern of the Cd(OH)2 passivated CdSe porous nanowires/nanosheets after PEC measurement to that of before PEC analysed samples. However, XRD patterns (Fig. S10c†) and FESEM images (Fig. S11†) of the CdSxSe1−x photoelectrode prepared via addition of 0.1 M Na2S during the second hydrothermal synthesis are completely different from those of the Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS. Fig. S12(a–c)† show that the photocurrent density of the CdSxSe1−x photoelectrode is much less than that of Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NSs. This may be due to the different Cd ion exchange process from that of the ion exchange process during the photoelectrochemical analyses in solution of Na2S/Na2SO3 as a scavenger. Fig. 5(E) shows the CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheets broadly ranged emissions in the visible region with emission peaks appearing at 470 and 590 nm under 379 nm laser excitation. These broad emissions are due to high density of surface defect states in the nanosheets with a large surface to volume ratio.19,53 In the case of the porous Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS photoanodes, PL appears around near the CdSe band-edge region at 730 nm with considerable suppression of electron–hole recombination in the visible region. To more deeply understand photoexcited carrier dynamics, we performed a time-resolved PL study. From careful fitting of the PL decay curves, both the photoelectrode materials showed multiple lifetime components because of several intrinsic recombination routes in the hybrid materials. However, the time regime of the average lifetime value is obviously different from each other. The PL lifetime image clearly presents a lifetime change (Fig. 5F). The porous Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS photoanode showed much shorter lifetime (0.4 ns) compared to the CdSe(en)0.5 with an average lifetime of 47 ns (Table S1†). Contrary to the conventional heterostructure with an elongated exciton recombination lifetime,54,55 in this study, the observed fast PL lifetime in the heterostructure interestingly means that the porous Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS material undergoes an efficient non-radiative process dominantly such as charge transfer probably along with the conduction band, leaving holes in the valence band of Cd(OH)2 phase and resulting in emissive recombination in the CdSe phase. This confirms that the second hydrothermal treatment of CdSe(en)0.5 not only enhances light harvesting through CdS/CdSe NW/NS transformation of Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS, but also reduces the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. To further understand the improved PEC performance of Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NSs grown on the Cd substrate the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was determined by evaluating double-layer capacitance measurements (Fig. 6a–d).56 It was seen that the scan rate has a profound effect on the amount of observed current density. The calculated value of ECSA for optimum Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NSs is 68 F cm−2 which is significantly higher than that of CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheets (28 F cm−2). This higher ECSA normally allows more effective accessibility of active sites and is thus attributed to transport, and reducing electron recombination.57

On the basis of the above results, a possible growth mechanism of CdS/CdSe NW/NS from Cd(OH)2 decorated CdSe NW/NS photoanodes is shown in Scheme 1. Due to the leaching out of remaining (en)0.5 from the CdSe(en)0.5, in addition to the porous CdSe and some of the [Cd(en)0.5]2+, Cd2+ and Se2− ions can be formed and control the growth of Cd(OH)2 crystals on the porous CdSe NW/NS by binding the crystal facets.58 The non-uniform Cd(OH)2 layered structure on porous CdSe NW/NS was formed through a dissolution–formation process and is also confirmed from the TEM analysis.
 Scheme 1  The schematic diagram showing the probable steps involved in the ion exchange strategy during PEC measurement using Cd(OH)2/CdSe porous NW/NS photoanodes. 
In the second step during the photoelectrochemical measurements in Na2S/Na2SO3 electrolyte, the outer surface of the Cd(OH)2 starts to convert into CdS through an ion-exchange strategy by using Cd(OH)2 and S2− ions in the electrolyte (Scheme 1a). As the solubility constant of Cd(OH)2 is much lower than that of the CdS, CdS can be easily synthesized from Cd(OH)2 through the S2−/OH ion-exchange reaction.59 As the illumination time increases during the photoelectrochemical measurements, then the S2−/OH ion-exchange reaction progressed from the outer surface of Cd(OH)2 into the inside of the porous part of Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS electrodes(Scheme 1(b, c)).60,61 Thus, under visible light irradiation the newly formed CdS/CdSe NW/NSs can be excited and generate electrons and holes, the photo-generated electrons are transferred to the substrate and simultaneously the holes may be reacting with the hole scavengers in the Na2S/Na2SO3 electrolyte. The photogenerated holes reactions at the photoanode surface are explained in the literature.61 At the same time some part of the CdSe NW/NS which is not covered with the Cd(OH)2 is also directly exposed to the electrolyte and under illumination produces electrons and holes and contributes to photocurrent generation. This reduces the recombination probability of the more reactive photogenerated, electrons and holes in CdS/CdSe NW/NS. As a result, the existence of non-uniform Cd(OH)2 helps to effectively suppress the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. However, owing to its wide band gap, the unmodified Cd(OH)2 acts as a surface passivator for porous CdSe NW/NS's.60 The photocurrent response of converted CdS modified Cd(OH)2/CdSe porous NW/NSs is much higher than that of pure CdSe(en)0.5, indicating the ability of the photoanode to effectively separate and transfer charge under light irradiation.
As the illumination time increased, the photocurrent density decreased rapidly (Fig. S13†); this is due to the maximum transformation of Cd(OH)2 to the CdS (Scheme 1c) as well as band gap mismatch of CdS and CdSe. Therefore, in this system, the existence of porous CdSe nanosheets and CdS modified Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NSs enhanced the active surface area, light absorption and reduced charge-transfer resistance thereby greatly enhancing its PEC performance. Thus, the aforementioned descriptions indicate that self-supported Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS can be an active alternative for metal sulfide photoelectrodes to improve the photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution efficiency. Therefore, from the photocatalyst structure point of view, we have summarized photoelectrochemical performances of the CdSe based composite type photoanodes with recent progress for an improved HER, as shown in Table S2.† Thus, the ion-exchange strategy of Cd(OH)2 intermediates will also be suitable for constructing other porous oxide/sulfide heterostructures. However, for the practical application the stability of the photoanodes is one of the key factors. A general way to improve the stability of the sulphide based photoanodes is to modify the surface with large band gap materials or a cocatalyst to isolate the photoactive surface from the electrolyte.62,63
In the present study, we investigated the effects of aluminium precursor (Al(Cl3)3) concentrations, on photocurrent density and stability of optimum Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS synthesized at 160 °C for 6 h. Fig. 7(a) shows that photocurrent density increases with the increase in the Al(Cl3)3 precursor concentration, and achieved maximum current density for the 10 mM Al(Cl3)3 concentration. However, further increase in the precursor concentration to 15 mM leads to a decrease of PEC activity. The decrease in photocurrent density of 15 mM alumina passivated Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS photoanodes might be due to greater alumina thickness. The excessive amount of the Al2O3 overlayer leads to the increase of the electron–hole diffusion distance leading to a higher recombination rate or poor visible light absorption.64,65
 Fig. 7  (a) Linear sweep voltammograms and (b) transient photocurrent responses of 5 mM Al, 10 mM and 15 mM Al modified Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS photoanodes, (c) EIS of 5 mM Al, 10 mM Al modified Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS photoanodes, and (d) open circuit potential vs. time profile of optimum 0 mM Al and 10 mM Al modified Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS heterostructures measured at −0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl under the Xe lamp light source (λ > 420 nm. 
Noticeably, the appropriate thickness of the Al2O3 layer deposited on Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS only exhibits a higher photoelectrocatalytic performance, due to optimum photogenerated charge transport. To measure the photoresponse of the Al2O3 passivated Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS photoanodes, the J–t curves were recorded at an applied potential of −0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Fig. 7(b) further shows that the photocurrent densities of the as-prepared photoanodes can follow the order as 10 mM Al > 5 mM Al > 15 mM Al (Al2O3 passivated Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS photoanodes). To explore the charge transfer process in these photoanodes the EIS of optimum 10 mM Al was measured and compared with that of the 5 mM Al passivated Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS (Fig. 7(c)). The decreased arc of the semicircle in the low-frequency response corresponds to lower charge transfer resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface, suggesting that the photogenerated holes dramatically transfer to the electrolyte due to the high catalytic property of Al2O3 in 10 mM photoanodes. Fig. 7(d) shows the open circuit voltage (OCV) of optimum Al-10 and Al-0 (Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS) photoanodes measured under chopped light conditions.
Generally, larger OCV (the difference between OCVlight and OCVdark) indicates a higher separation efficiency of photogenerated charges and greater band bending which further lead to a high PEC performance.66 In the present work, the 10 mM Al photoanode represents the largest OCV value compared to that of the 0 mM Al (Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS), and thus exhibits the highest PEC activity. Furthermore, the surface morphology of the optimum 10 mM Al modified Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS photoanodes is shown in Fig. S14(a and b).† However there is no change in the morphology of Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS after the Al modification. The existence of elements in the 10 mM Al modified Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS and its chemical composition was further confirmed by EDS spectroscopy (Fig. S14(c–e)†). The EDS spectrum and the corresponding element tables show the peaks of Cd, Se, S, Al and O elements at their corresponding keV values, which suggest the presence of Al2O3 on the surface of photoanodes. Noticeably, the appropriate thickness of the Al2O3 layer deposited on Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS exhibits a higher photoelectrocatalytic performance, because an excessive amount of Al2O3 overlayer will lead to the increase of recombination of photogenerated charge carriers and/or blocking of incident light.
Conclusions
In conclusion, Cd(OH)2 decorated porous CdSe NW/NS heterostructures have been developed from the inorganic–organic CdSe(en)0.5 hybrid nanosheets grown on the Cd substrate via a chemical conversion approach. The morphology and phase transformation of CdSe(en)0.5 hybrid nanosheets with hydrothermal time revealed the slow dissolution of the CdSe(en)0.5 structure and self-assembly growth process of the Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS structure. Formation and influence of Cd(OH)2 content as a intermediator for CdS and passivation layers during the photoelectrochemical performance of CdSe NW/NS were systemically investigated. The photocurrent density of 6.1 mA cm−2 was achieved for the optimized Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS photoelectrode which is 7.6 times higher than that of inorganic–organic CdSe(en)0.5 nanosheet photoanodes. The combined influence of significantly improved charge transfer, visible light absorption, and suppressed recombination leads to enhanced photoelectrochemical performance of CdS modified porous Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS heterostructure photoanodes prepared under optimum conditions. The surface modification with Al2O3 treatment further improves the photoelectrochemical stability of Cd(OH)2/CdSe NW/NS photoanodes. In addition to the phase and morphology transfigured Cd(OH)2-decorated porous CdSe NW/NS heterostructures, next effort will be made to improving the performance and stability of the family of II–VI-based inorganic–organic lamellar-type hybrid photoanodes. Thus, we anticipate that our strategy will open up an alternative avenue for the development of highly efficient photoelectrode materials for solving the energy challenges in the near future.
