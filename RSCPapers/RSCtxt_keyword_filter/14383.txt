    , Accepted 30th September 2010First published on 1st December 2010AbstractIn this Perspective article we describe how the processes involving the redox shuttle—dye regeneration, recombination, and diffusion—affect the photovoltaic performance of dye-sensitized solar cells, DSSCs. Key literature on the mechanistically complicated, but ubiquitously employed, triiodide/iodide electrolyte is reviewed. Literature examples and recent results from our laboratory in utilizing one-electron outersphere redox shuttles in place of triiodide/iodide are then presented.
Introduction
It is now widely accepted that it is imperative to develop less carbon-intensive sources of energy in order to minimize the environmental, political and economic consequences associated with continued reliance on fossil fuels.1–7 Of all the carbon neutral power options that currently exist—wind, hydro, geothermal, nuclear, biomass, and solar—solar is the only one that can realistically be implemented on a large enough scale to meet our foreseeable energy demands.1–3 While efficient solar energy conversion has been around for decades the cost of electricity production from solar conversion is roughly an order of magnitude higher than conventional coal-based sources, which continues to hamper wide spread use of this technology.1–3
A significant breakthrough in the quest for a low-cost solar energy conversion technology came in 1991 with the report by O'Regan and Grätzel of a photovoltaic device based on the sensitization of nanoparticle (NP) TiO2 electrodes.8 Since they are based on an extremely inexpensive NP material, dye-sensitized solar cells, DSSCs, are a potentially disruptive technology for solar energy conversion. The best existing laboratory cells deliver an impressive overall energy conversion efficiency of 11%, while the efficiency of scaled up modules is in the 7–8% range, resulting from increased resistive losses.9–11 Despite the modest module efficiencies compared to other photovoltaic technologies, commercialization is already being pursued due to the very low materials and processing costs.12 Therefore, any additional improvements in DSSC conversion efficiency should make this technology economically compelling for large scale applications.
A diagram illustrating the energetics and key kinetic processes occurring in a DSSC is given in Fig. 1a. Light is absorbed by a chromophore (dye molecule) attached to the surface of a TiO2 nanoparticle (k1). The excited dye rapidly injects an electron into the TiO2 conduction band (k2) which is ultimately the source of the photocurrent. A redox shuttle in solution is employed to regenerate the dye (k3); diffusion of the oxidized form of the redox shuttle (Do) to be reduced at the counter electrode completes the circuit. These processes compete with several reactions that inhibit the efficient operation of a DSSC including decay (either radiative or nonradiative) of the chromophore's excited state prior to injection (k−1) as well as back-electron transfer from the TiO2 nanoparticle to the oxidized dye (k4) or the oxidized form of the redox shuttle (k5).

The k3 and Do arrows indicate the positive processes involving the redox shuttle, the k5 arrow indicates the deleterious process involving the redox shuttle, and the remaining arrows represent processes independent of the redox shuttle. b) Schematic of a DSSC device indicating the relevant processes of the redox shuttle described in the text: regeneration (k3), diffusion (Do), and recombination (k5). The tortuous path of the oxidized redox shuttle is depicted; however, the actual path is much longer and more complicated. 
In the most studied and most efficient devices to date, the chromophore is a ruthenium-based molecular dye—[Ru(4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine)2(NCS)2] (N3), (Bu4N)2[Ru(4-carboxy,4′-carboxylato-2,2′-bipyridine)2(NCS)2] (N719), or (Bu4N)2[Ru(4,4′,4′′-tricarboxy-2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine)2(NCS)3] (black dye)—that is bound to a photoanode via carboxylate groups.13–15 The photoanode consists of a ∼12 μm thick mesoporous film of 10–20 nm diameter TiO2 nanoparticles sintered together. Sometimes an additional ∼4 μm thick film of much larger (∼300–400 nm diameter) particles are also deposited to scatter light back through the film to enhance light absorption.16 The redox shuttle is generally I3−/I−, dissolved in an organic solvent such as acetonitrile.17 Optimized electrolytes also contain additives such as Li+ and tert-butyl pyridine, primarily to control the photoanode energetics.
The overall kinetic scheme of a DSSC is obviously complex, with many interdependent processes. Changing any one component (dye, redox shuttle, photoanode) is expected to affect several processes which can improve or diminish overall performance. For example, using a new dye will affect injection (k2), relaxation (k−1), recombination to the oxidized dye (k4) and dye regeneration (k3). Changing the photoanode will affect injection (k2), charge diffusion, recombination to the oxidized dye (k4) and redox shuttle (k5).18 Implementing an alternative redox shuttle will affect dye regeneration (k3), recombination to the oxidized redox shuttle (k5), diffusion to/from the counter electrode (Do), as well as the charge transfer kinetics at the counter electrode. Advancing DSSC efficiency will very likely require the use of new redox shuttles (or hole conducting materials). In this review, we discuss how the processes relevant to the redox shuttle directly affect the efficiency, what is known about these processes with respect to I3−/I−, and recent results of DSSCs employing one electron, outersphere redox shuttles. While outersphere redox shuttles have not matched the overall efficiency of innersphere redox shuttles such as I3−/I−, they are not hampered by the additional mechanistic complications of innersphere redox reactions and thus serve as excellent model systems to understand the operational principles of DSSCs.
Power conversion efficiency
The power conversion efficiency of a solar cell, η, is the ratio of the maximum electrical power output, Pmax, to the incident solar power, Pin. The maximum electrical power output is the product of the photocurrent density and the voltage at the power point, usually expressed as (1)where Jsc is the short circuit photocurrent density, Voc is the open-circuit photovoltage, and ff is the fill factor (see Fig. 2). The parameters Jsc, Voc, and ff are diagnostically informative, and expressions for these are presented below. An emphasis is placed on how the redox shuttle directly affects each parameter.
 Fig. 2  Simulated photocurrent density vs. voltage curve with Jsc = 17 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.82 V, and ff = 0.82 (values corresponding to an 11% efficient cell in response to 100 mW cm−2 illumination). 
i. Short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc)
The short circuit photocurrent density is a function of the dye absorptance, αλ, the incident photon flux, Φp, the charge injection efficiency, ηinj, dye regeneration efficiency, ηreg, and charge collection efficiency, ηcc. The absorptance is the fraction of photons absorbed at a given wavelength described by the Beer–Lambert law (neglecting any reflectance, scattering or substrate absorbance) in the form αλ = 1 − 10−ε(λ)Cd, where ε(λ) is the dye's molar absorption coefficient, C is dye concentration (which is determined by a combination of dye loading and the photoanode roughness factor), and d is the electrode thickness. Integration of the absorptance and photon flux over all wavelengths (the wavelength range of interest is limited by the optical gap of the dye, λdye, and the band gap of the TiO2, λTiO2) produces the total flux of photons absorbed.19 The photocurrent density at short circuit is then given by: (2)where q is the charge of an electron.
The charge injection efficiency is the kinetic competition between injection and the radiative or non-radiative deactivation of the excited state dye. Injection is often taken to be ‘ultra fast’ and have unity efficiency. While a fraction of injection is on the femtosecond timescale, the injection dynamics are highly dispersive.20–22 It is worth noting that efficient injection requires the slowest component of injection to be faster than competing deactivation processes, not just the fastest. Recent work has established that in a working cell, injection efficiency is highly variable and often quite a bit less than unity.22–24 There has also been some recent experimental evidence that the presence of I− in the electrolyte can affect injection dynamics;25 however, for outersphere redox shuttles, injection should be independent of the redox shuttle. Conditions can generally be found to ensure efficient injection, and will therefore not be considered further herein.
The regeneration efficiency is determined by the kinetic competition between dye regeneration and recombination with the oxidized dye. Assuming dye regeneration can be described by a simple one electron transfer reaction, the following mechanism and rate equation apply:26 (3) Ureg = k3[R][Dye+](4)where R and R+ represent the reduced and oxidized form of the redox shuttle respectively. Recombination to the oxidized dye is: (5) Urec,dye = k4ns[Dye+](6)where ns is the electron concentration at the surface of the photoanode. Therefore the regeneration yield is given by the branching ratio: (7)assuming [R] and ns are in excess compared to [Dye+]. The expression for ns is given in the Voc section below (eqn (10)); it should be noted here, however, that the regeneration yield is expected to decrease with increasing applied potential due to the potential dependence of ns.27 In addition, electrolyte concentrations under operating conditions deviate from the equilibrium values which must also be taken into account. Nevertheless, in order to have a 95% regeneration yield, regeneration must be ∼20-fold faster than recombination to the oxidized dye. Regeneration with I− is mechanistically more complicated, however, as discussed in detail below.
The charge collection efficiency is largely determined by the kinetic competition between electron transport and recombination reflected by the electron diffusion length, Ln.18,22,28,29 Halme et al. derived the following expression for the charge collection efficiency:30 (8)assuming illumination is through the photoanode side and recombination is first order in free electron concentration. Good charge collection thus requires Ln to be greater than the electrode thickness, d, or light penetration depth, α(λ,d)−1.30 Therefore, the current density can be limited (via Ln) by recombination to the redox shuttle. Recombination is discussed below.
The above description of the photocurrent density is limited to processes occurring at the interface of the electrode with the dye/electrolyte. The diffusion of the redox shuttle to/from the photoanode from/to the counter electrode is in series with the other photocurrent generation processes. The flux of the redox species through the mesoporous photoelectrode film can therefore limit the possible photocurrent density, i.e. the current density can be diffusion limited.31,32 The electrolyte diffusion receives comparatively little attention, however it is important when considering alternative redox shuttles and will be addressed below.
ii. Open circuit photovoltage (Voc)
The voltage, V, is the difference between the Nernstian potential of the solution, E(R+/R), and the quasi-Fermi level, EF/q, (i.e. potential of the semiconductor) at the contacting electrode. At open circuit, the photocurrent density is exactly offset by recombination, Urec, such that Jsc − qUrec = 0. Recombination is generally used to refer to electron transfer from the semiconductor to the oxidized dye and the oxidized form of the redox shuttle. Assuming dye regeneration is efficient (ηreg ∼1), recombination to the dye is negligible and thus consists only of electron transfer to the oxidized form of the redox shuttle, R+; the rate of recombination is then given by:26,33–37 Urec = k5[R+]ns(9)where ns refers to the free electron concentration at the electrode surface. The term ns is used here since only the fraction of electrons within ∼1 nm of the electrode surface should be able to participate in recombination. Assuming fast equilibration of electrons in the bulk of a nanoparticle with the surface (analogous to the ‘quasi-static’ approximation described below), the surface concentration is just a fraction, ζ, of the total concentration, n, of electrons in the semiconductor. The size of the nanoparticle determines the fraction, which should thus impart a particle size dependence on recombination.38 The surface electron concentration is then given by36,37,39 (10)where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, and n0 is the electron concentration in the conduction band in the dark,36,37 (11)NC is the effective density of states in the conduction band, and ECB is the conduction band energy. Assuming recombination is first order in ns (discussed in the recombination section below), recombination can be expressed as an electron lifetime according to:36,37,40,41 τ0 = (k5[R+])−1(12)Setting eqn (9) equal to Jsc/q (thus V = Voc), yields (13)and rearranging produces the following familiar expression for the open circuit photovoltage: (14)The Voc will thus increase with increasing photocurrent density and increasing lifetime (decreasing recombination). The largest increase in Voc can be realized by making the solution potential more positive, which is reflected in a decreasing n0 (eqn (11)). The open circuit photovoltage is thus highly sensitive to the properties of the redox couple, via Jsc, τ0 and n0.
iii. Fill factor
The fill factor is a term introduced to relate Pmax to the parameters Jsc and Voc, corresponding to the ratio of the area under a J–V curve defined by Pmax to the area defined by Jsc and Voc (Fig. 2).39 The maximum fill factor is strictly a function of the diode quality factor, γ, and the Voc. There are numerous processes which can cause the apparent diode quality factor to exceed the ideal value of 1, including surface state mediated recombination. Direct electron transfer from the photoanode substrate to the electrolyte (shunting) can also impact the fill factor, especially in cases where outersphere redox shuttles are used; however this can be overcome through use of a blocking layer and will not be considered further.42–45 The actual fill factor is also attenuated by any uncompensated series resistance, Rs, in the cell. Including γ and Rs, the J–V characteristics can be described in terms of the diode equation written as: (15)

Fig. 3 shows simulated J–V curves based on the modified diode equation (eqn (15)); the relevant parameters are given in Table 1. The electrolytes typically employed have a high ionic strength which makes them sufficiently conductive. The mass-transport resistance can be significant for outersphere redox couples, however, which can decrease the fill factor and thus efficiency. In addition, while platinum acts as a good catalyst for the reduction of I3− at the counter electrode, thereby minimizing the charge transfer resistance, it does not necessarily apply to all redox shuttles.46,47 For non-optimized counter electrodes, the charge transfer resistance can likewise diminish the fill factor. The diffusion of redox shuttles, and the diffusion and charge transfer resistances are addressed below.

Dye regeneration
i. Iodide electrolyte
The vast majority of DSSC research, and all reports of highly efficient (>10%) cells, have utilized I− to regenerate the dye. The mechanism of the reduction of dye cations by iodide is still under debate, however the first two steps appear to proceed by the sequential reactions: I− + Dye+ → [I−:Dye+](16) [I−:Dye+] + I− → I2− + Dye(17)where the first step is fast and the second step rate limiting.17,48–50 Subsequent steps involving the fate of I2− are discussed below. The overall yield of the regeneration reaction is thus dependent upon interaction of a second iodide ion with a [I−:Dye+] complex.48 At least in the case of the N3/N719 dyes, the intermediate complex consists of the iodide bound to the sulfur atom of the thiocyanate ligand. In this situation, the metal center is reduced, thus the complex is better represented as [I:Dye]. The intermediate complex with dyes not containing an SCN ligand, however, is unknown. Interaction of the second iodide leads to immediate dissociation of I2− from the dye molecule. In support of this, the I2− anion radical has been detected spectroscopically in numerous reports.48–50 The diiodide radicals then disproportionate, forming iodide and triiodide:17 2I2− → I− + I3−(18)
An interesting alternative secondary mechanism has recently been put forth where the diiodide radical reduces a second dye cation, instead of undergoing disproportionation.51 In this case, a [I2:Dye] complex is formed.51 Interaction with an iodide then leads to dissociation of the I3−, as described by: I2− + Dye+ → [I2:Dye](19) [I2:Dye] + I− → I3− + Dye(20)
When I3−/I− is used in combination with N3, the regeneration yield is quantitative.48 This is one reason why this system has produced the highest efficiencies over the last 18 years. Despite the excellent performance of I3−/I− as a redox shuttle with N3, the regeneration of other dyes with I3−/I− can be inefficient.48 Poor regeneration kinetics has likely prevented alternative dyes which are otherwise advantageous (e.g. they have a lower cost, larger resource base, broader absorption) from being used effectively.52–54 The complicated, subtle, innersphere nature of dye regeneration with I3−/I− further inhibits the insight needed to design new dyes which could lead to improved efficiency.
ii. Ferrocene/phenothiazine
The simpler kinetics makes the use of outersphere redox couples in place of I3−/I− very attractive as model systems. In this case, dye regeneration can be described by a simple one electron transfer reaction as presented above. The rate constant for dye regeneration should thus be describable in terms of Marcus theory using the cross relation:56–58 (21)where kD+/D and kR+/R are the self-exchange rate constants for the dye and redox shuttle, respectively, and KDR is the equilibrium constant of the reaction.57 The cross relation was developed to describe homogeneous electron-transfer reactions, not the pseudo-heterogeneous reaction between one component dissolved in solution and one immobilized on a surface.59–62 While it is not clear what the self-exchange rate constant is for a dye immobilized on a semiconductor surface, when fast self-exchange redox shuttles (very high kR+/R) such as ferrocene or phenothiazine are employed, regeneration is very fast and quantitative, in general agreement with predictions from the cross relation (see Fig. 4). Unfortunately, these fast redox shuttles also generally suffer from fast recombination which produces a low charge collection efficiency and photovoltage (described in the following section on recombination). As noted above, outersphere redox shuttles also generally suffer from fast recombination via the substrate (shunting); however this deleterious reaction can be readily overcome by using an appropriate blocking layer.43–45,63

iii. Nickel bis(dicarbollide)
Recently a novel Ni(IV)/(III) bis(dicarbollide) redox couple was employed as a one-electron outersphere redox shuttle in DSSCs.64 The overall photovoltaic performance of this shuttle is promising, with efficiencies of 1.5%. The relevant kinetic parameters were investigated to elucidate the limiting kinetic pathways of this shuttle. Transient absorption measurements of the N719 recovery kinetics indicated fast and essentially quantitative regeneration with only 0.03 M of the reduced species present; ∼5% of the typical regenerator concentration used. Regeneration was actually found to be faster compared to I−, when the same concentration was employed. Importantly, recombination was shown to be ∼1,000-fold slower compared to ferrocene, attributed to the activation barrier of reducing Ni(IV) to Ni(III) which induces a cis to trans conformation change, making this reaction less prohibitive. The relative rates of fast regeneration and slow recombination make the Ni(IV)/(III) bis(dicarbollide) redox couple a very promising system.
iv. Copper bis-2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline
A conceptually similar system was utilized with the [Cu(dmp)2]2+/+ (dmp = 2,9-dimethy-1,10-phenanthroline) redox shuttle which undergoes a distortion (flattening) of the pseudo-tetrahedral [Cu(dmp)2]+ upon oxidation which leads to ‘gated’ electron-transfer behavior.65 In the case of [Cu(dmp)2]2+/+, however, regeneration of N719 was found to be the primary limitation to good photovoltaic performance. The formal potential of [Cu(dmp)2]2+/+ is 0.66 V vs. SCE, which is only ∼50 mV negative of N719.65 The poor regeneration efficiency is therefore not surprising given the minimal driving force of this reaction.
v. Cobalt tris-4,4′-R-2,2′-bipyridine
Dye regeneration by slow self-exchange redox shuttles, such as cobalt polypyridyl complexes, is slower compared to ferrocene or phenothiazine, consistent with the cross relation (see Fig. 4). Nevertheless, outersphere redox shuttles such as [Co(R2bpy)3]3+/2+ can be better at regenerating certain dyes than I3−/I−. For example, when [Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy)]2+ is employed as a dye, both [Co(Me2bpy)3]3+/2+ and [Co(t-Bu2bpy)3]3+/2 produce higher IPCEs than I3−/I− based cells (Fig. 5).42 The low IPCE of DSSCs with I3−/I− is almost certainly due to poor regeneration despite the very large (∼1 eV) driving force of the reaction. Given what is known about the regeneration mechanism with I−, a likely reason for the poor regeneration of [Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy)]2+ is the lack of an available moiety (such as SCN) for I− to bind to. In support of this, inefficient generation with I− has also been observed with other dyes that are structurally similar to N3 but with chloride or cyanate ligands in place of the thiocyanate moieties.48 In addition to [Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy)]2+, [Co(R2bpy)3]3+/2+ shuttles were found to regenerate N3 efficiently.42 However, the driving force for regeneration of N3 by [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ is ∼0.5 eV, which is much larger than is optimal.19 Unfortunately, efficient regeneration by slow self-exchange redox shuttles like [Co(R2bpy)3]3+/2+ may be limited to such large driving force reactions, which can prevent them from achieving higher efficiency cells than I3−/I−.19 Nevertheless, use of such outersphere redox shuttles can be advantageous when investigating new dyes due to the simpler kinetics.

Charge recombination
Recombination (here referring only to electron transfer to the oxidized form of the redox shuttle) is the reaction that has largely prevented outersphere redox shuttles or hole transport materials to replace I3−/I− in a DSSC. Recombination is usually cast in terms of the electron lifetime (see eqn (12)). The electron lifetimes can be readily measured by a variety of techniques including open circuit voltage decay, impedance spectroscopy, intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy, and other transient photovoltage methods.23,28,29,40,41,49,63,66,67 Not all electrons in the anode are free conduction band electrons, however. There are sub-band gap states in the nanoparticle electrode that trap and release electrons as depicted in Fig. 6.29,36,37,40,68 The trap states have an exponential distribution, as determined by impedance, cyclic voltammetry, and charge extraction measurements.69–71 Electrons trapped in the bulk of the nanoparticle are not able to participate in recombination (or diffusion). The trap states thereby modulate the concentration of free conduction band electrons and therefore the lifetimes (and charge diffusion). The measured electron lifetimes, τn, depend on the following steady state relationship of free conduction band electrons, nc, to trapped electrons, nt, according to:35,37,40,72 (22)This relationship is generally referred to as the quasi-static approximation. As a consequence, measured lifetimes exhibit an exponential dependence on potential.

Here, EF is the Fermi energy, Ecb is the conduction band energy, E(R+/R) is the solution potential defined by the redox shuttle, Urec represents the rate of recombination of conduction band electrons, and Uss represents recombination of electrons via surface states. The trapping of electrons in an exponential density of bulk trap states or surface states and the de-trapping to the conduction band are represented by the double arrows. 
i. Surface states
An open question is the extent to which recombination occurs from surface states or whether only conduction band electrons need to be considered. Since the coordination environment of the nanoparticle electrode's surface atoms is inherently different from the bulk, there will necessarily be distinct electronic states associated with the surface (i.e. surface states). Surface states may also arise from dislocations, grain boundaries or step edges, which are expected to be present on a nanoparticle surface. If the energies of these surface states are between the redox shuttle potential and the conduction band energy, they may participate in recombination, depicted as Uss in Fig. 6. There have been some reports which provide indirect evidence of surface states playing a role in recombination, however there is very little direct evidence.43,73 A signature of recombination from surface states is a nonlinear region in the log–linear plot of lifetime vs. voltage.29,35,40 A recent report did show clear evidence of surface state mediated recombination, notably highly nonlinear lifetimes.74 An aqueous electrolyte containing a polysulfide redox shuttle was employed in that work, however, which may alter the nature (energy/reactivity) of the surface states. In addition, Cameron and Peter demonstrated that if a blocking layer is not used, shunting via the substrate can produce non-linear lifetimes, which can easily be misinterpreted as surface state recombination.37,45 It is thus still not clear if surface states play a role in more conventional configurations of DSSCs. Understanding the role of surface states in recombination is imperative if theoretical models are to be used to guide the design of new DSSCs.
ii. Iodide electrolyte
Another open question in the case of the I3−/I− electrolyte is what is acting as the electron acceptor. There are several possible acceptor species—I2, I3−, I2− and I˙—which can be present in the electrolyte.17 Several mechanistic schemes have been put forward to describe recombination to these different acceptors. Details of the possible mechanisms and their associated rate laws have recently been presented in full elsewhere.75 We point out that superposition generally holds for DSSCs.19 This implies that the ‘dark current’ is a measure of the relevant recombination process that limits the Voc. Lifetime measurements performed in the dark are also consistent with photovoltaic measurements made under illumination (see Fig. 8 and 9). We therefore discount photo-generated species (I2− and I˙) from being the significant acceptors. This leaves only I2 and I3− as the primary candidates. Select evidence for and against I2 and I3− being the acceptor is discussed below.
Transient absorption was used to measure the electron transfer kinetics from TiO2 to I2, which established first order behavior with respect to I2.76 Interestingly, no spectroscopic signal associated with I2− was observed, which was explained by assuming adsorption of the intermediate I˙ to the metal oxide surface (Iads). The overall rate of recombination was found to decrease by approximately 100-fold upon the addition of 0.7 M I− to the 0.05 M I2 solution. This result was taken as evidence that I2 is the main acceptor species. The equilibrium constant, I− + I2 ↔ I3−Keq ≈ 107 M−1(23)strongly favors the formation of I3− in the presence of I−.17 Since electrolytes generally contain an excess of I− to ensure efficient regeneration, essentially all of the I2 is converted to I3−. For example, the electrolyte prepared with 0.7 M I− and 0.05 M I2 would contain an equilibrium concentration of ∼8 nM of I2 (corresponding to approximately 1 molecule of I2 per 50,000 TiO2 nanoparticles, assuming 20 nm diameter particles); the rest of the I2 introduced is converted to I3−. Considering the extremely low equilibrium concentration of I2, the lack of direct evidence of Iads, and inconsistencies associated with alternative mechanisms, we remain skeptical about I2 being the dominant acceptor in typical I3−/I− electrolytes.17,75,76
If I2 is not the main acceptor in I3−/I− electrolytes, electron transfer to I3− may be the primary recombination reaction. The overall reaction can be described by the following net reaction:17,49,50 e−(TiO2) + I3− → I2− + I−(24)When care was taken to account for variations in solution potential with I3− concentration, first order behavior with respect to I3− was found for recombination.17 The mechanistic details for this reaction—if it occurs—are also uncertain. For example, electron transfer to I3− is a possible first step: e−(TiO2) + I3− → I32−(25)To the best of our knowledge, however, the intermediate I32− has not been observed. This may be due to the fact that the following dissociation is extremely fast: I32− → I2− + I−(26)Interestingly, the reduction of both I3− and I2 should generate the intermediate I2− (in addition to regeneration). While the intermediate I2− has been identified in functioning DSSCs, it was not observed in a spectroscopic investigation of recombination.76 We point out that there are additional alternative mechanisms proposed which are possible.38,75,77,78 Therefore a definitive answer about several mechanistic aspects of recombination with I3−/I− electrolytes, including what the acceptor and intermediate species are, remains elusive.
In addition to the intrinsic complications associated with the I3−/I− redox system, interactions of the dye with I3− needs to be considered. For example, it has been shown that when I3−/I− is used as the redox shuttle with certain organic dyes, larger dark current densities are observed compared to similar electrodes sensitized with N3.79 The increased recombination is attributed to the formation of dye–I3− or dye–I2 complexes which produce an enhanced concentration of acceptor at the semiconductor surface.80 Formation of dye–I3− complexes can also produce additional deleterious reactions such as direct quenching of the dye's excited state.79 Eliminating reactions derived from interactions with the dye should provide additional motivation to use outersphere redox systems in investigating new sensitizers, especially organic dyes.
iii. Alternative innersphere shuttles
It is further not clear that what is learned about the I3−/I− shuttle can be applied to the development of alternative redox shuttles. There have been some recent intriguing reports of alternate redox shuttles which are also likely innersphere and multi-electron couples. For example the Br3−/Br− couple, which is probably the closest analog to I3−/I−, has been investigated recently.81,82 When used in combination with carbazole dyes, to allow sufficient driving force for regeneration, Voc values of over 1 V were achieved.82 In addition, novel disulfide/thiolate redox shuttles were developed which produced efficiencies of over 6%.83 Achieving high efficiencies may actually require exploiting the complicated innersphere reactions of such shuttles. It is likely, however, that these shuttles will suffer from the same complications as I3−/I−, which makes progress in understanding general mechanistic details problematic. In contrast, electron-transfer reactions involving one electron, outersphere redox couples should behave according to a more straightforward mechanism.26,84
iv. Ferrocene
The ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc+/Fc) couple was amongst the first one-electron, outersphere redox shuttles to be investigated in a DSSC.44,84 Although ferrocene efficiently regenerates the dye (see Fig. 4), recombination with ferrocenium is prohibitively fast, thereby minimizing both Jsc and Voc.44,55 Gregg et al. showed that it is possible to use CH3SiCl3 vapor to form thin, insulating films of poly(methylsiloxane) on the TiO2 nanoparticles.44 The siloxane coatings were of sufficient quality to enable Fc+/Fc to function to some extent as a redox shuttle. Recently the siloxane coating method was re-examined, where an optimized coating procedure and dye combination produced photovoltages of over 600 mV with the Fc+/Fc shuttle.85
Another approach to control recombination is to use a barrier layer coating. Several wide band gap oxides, including ZrO2,86–89 Al2O3,86,90–93 Nb2O5,88,89 and SiO2,86 have been examined as coatings on TiO2 photoanodes in DSSCs. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a technique capable of producing highly reproducible coatings which are robust, conformal, and pinhole-free.94 Therefore, ALD was used to deposit ultra-thin pinhole-free Al2O3 barrier layers on TiO2 nanoparticle photoanodes in contact with a ferrocene redox shuttle.43 It was found that coating the nanoparticles with a single ALD cycle (∼ 1.1 Å) of Al2O3 increased the photocurrent density by an order of magnitude for DSSCs employing a Fc+/Fc electrolyte, with a concomitant ∼200 mV increase in the photovoltage, shown in Fig. 7.43 These dramatic improvements were attributed to decreased recombination. The drawback of the barrier coating method, however, is that the barrier also slows electron injection, which can limit ηinj and Jsc. Consistent with this, when more than a single layer of Al2O3 was deposited, the photocurrent density decreased.43 Durrant and co-workers characterized such a tradeoff between decreasing recombination and injection rates as minimization of kinetic redundancy.21 It thus appears that, at least in this system, a single ALD layer is the optimal balance of slowing recombination, while maintaining efficient charge injection. Thus, while Fc+/0 is not expected to be a practical choice as a redox shuttle due to its very fast self exchange kinetics, it does serve as an excellent model system to test methods of controlling recombination.

Another advantage of employing outersphere redox shuttles such as ferrocene is the ability to make systematic variations of the redox shuttle and test the predictions of the equations presented above. Note that such systematic variations are not possible with I3−/I−. For example, addition of either one or two electron withdrawing chloride groups to ferrocene was used to generate a homologous series of redox shuttles with varying redox potentials: E(Fc+/0) = 0.31 V vs. SCE, E(Fc-Cl+/0) = 0.48 V vs. SCE and E(Fc-(Cl)2+/0) = 0.62 V vs. SCE. Dark current density vs. potential curves (Jdark(E)) are a direct measure of recombination; Jdark ≈ −qUrec. The Jdark value was found to be much lower at a given potential for Fc-(Cl)2+/0, compared to Fc-Cl+/0, and both lower than for Fc+/0 (Fig. 8a). The decreasing Jdark is primarily attributed to the change in redox potential, E(R+/R), which decreases n0. The dark current density did not decrease by the full amount expected by eqn (11), however. Ideally, the Jdark(E) curves would shift linearly with the solution potential E(R+/R). The difference between the measured dark current density and that expected by changing n0 implies that the recombination rate constant (k5) increases in the order Fc+ < Fc-Cl+ < Fc-(Cl)2+. Lifetime measurements were performed with the open circuit voltage decay technique. When the voltage was corrected for the variation in E(R+/R), the lifetimes decrease in the order predicted from the dark current density measurements; τn(Fc+) > τn(Fc-Cl+) > τn(Fc-(Cl)2+) (Fig. 8b). In all cases the lifetimes were substantially shorter than τn(I3−), even with an alumina barrier layer.

v. Cobalt tris-4,4′-R-2,2′-bipyridine
Unlike ferrocene based redox shuttles, cobalt polypyridyl complexes have well-known very slow electron self-exchange kinetics, with self exchange rate constants on the order of 20 M−1 s−1.62,95 The slow self-exchange kinetics are due to large innersphere reorganization energies induced by spin changes. When employed as redox shuttles in DSSCs, such cobalt complexes have shown promising, yet surprisingly varied, results.47,96,97 In order to determine the cause of the disparate photovoltaic performances from apparently similar redox shuttles, impedance measurements were performed on DSSCs in contact with a series of redox shuttles: [Co(t-Bu2bpy)3]3+/2+, [Co(Me2bpy)3]3+/2+, and [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+, where bpy is 2,2′-bipyridine (Fig. 9a). The separation of the charge transfer resistance, RCT, and transport resistance, RT, provides insight into the charge collection efficiency through the calculation of the effective diffusion length, Ln = d(RCT/RT)1/2. Since [Co(t-Bu2bpy)3]3+/2+ has the largest ratio of RCT to RT, it has the highest Ln and thus the highest collection efficiency of the three redox shuttles studied. Incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed for DSSCs also containing the [Co(t-Bu2bpy)3]3+/2+, [Co(Me2bpy)3]3+/2+, and [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ shuttles.42 Strikingly, the trend of the IPCEs for DSSCs was found to decrease in the order predicted by the impedance results: [Co(t-Bu2bpy)3]3+/2+ > [Co(Me2bpy)3]3+/2+ > [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ (Fig. 9b). These results demonstrate the ability to control the charge collection efficiency via molecular variation of the redox shuttle. In another work on a similar series of substituted phenanthroline cobalt complexes, analogous behavior was observed.73

An interesting strategy to regenerate dyes efficiently, without suffering from concomitant fast recombination was employed by using mixtures of fast and slow self exchange redox shuttles.55 In this situation, the fast couple is used to efficiently regenerate the dye, forming the oxidized form of the fast shuttle, which is then intercepted by the slow couple. The slow shuttle is used to transport the hole to the counter electrode, thereby limiting recombination to only the slow shuttle. When ferrocene or phenothiazine was used as a fast shuttle and [Co(t-Bu2bpy)3]3+/2+ as the slow shuttle, the overall photovoltaic performance for the mixed electrolyte was found to be superior to cells employing any one of the redox shuttles.55 While this strategy can achieve fast regeneration while minimizing recombination losses, the added electron-transfer step requires an energy penalty to drive it, as well as added complexity in optimizing it. Nevertheless, it is an intriguing approach to circumvent the kinetic limitations generally imposed on outersphere redox shuttles in DSSCs.
Diffusion
The oxidized form of the redox species has a necessary role in the efficient operation of DSSCs: the diffusion of the oxidized acceptor to the counter electrode completes the circuit and this mass transport flux is in series with other charge transport processes. As stated above, the diffusion of the redox shuttle can hinder both Jsc and ff. The diffusion limiting current density, Jlim, is proportional to the porosity, εp, the diffusion coefficient, Do, the concentration of the oxidized form of the redox shuttle (i.e. electron acceptor), [R+], and inversely proportional to the electrolyte diffusion distance, l, according to:98 (27)where F is a faraday. Fig. 10 shows the transient Jsc of a DSSC with the [Co(t-Bu2bpy)3]3+/2+ electrolyte, which is known to be limited by diffusion, in response to AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2).63,99 Once the DSSC is illuminated, the concentration of [Co(t-Bu2bpy)3]3+ at the counter electrode quickly decreases to zero and the initial current density decreases to Jlim. In this case the resulting Jsc is much less than it would be if it were not limited by diffusion.

The two properties of the redox shuttle which cause DSSCs utilizing outersphere redox shuttles such as [Co(t-Bu2bpy)3]3+/2+ to be diffusion limited are [R+] and Do. Due to low solubility, [R+] cannot be increased. It is noted that even if [R+] could be increased it would result in an increased rate of recombination at the photoanode (eqn (9)). The additional hindrance for bulky outersphere redox shuttles is a low Do value. Diffusion constants can be measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, rotating disk electrode voltammetry, as well as chronoamperometry.99–101Do values for [Co(t-Bu2bpy)3]3+ have been measured in bulk solution to be in the range Do ≈ 10−6–10−7 cm2 s−1 (depending on solvent and temperature) which is roughly one third that of I3−.99,101 More importantly however, Do values for [Co(t-Bu2bpy)3]3+ have also been measured for diffusion through porous nanoparticle TiO2 films and when compared to I3− were found to be an order of magnitude lower.99 The combination of high solubility and large diffusion coefficient prevents I3− from being diffusion limited.
The obvious and already mentioned detriment of poor diffusion is the limit it places on Jsc. The additional limitation diffusion places on DSSC efficiency is through the addition of diffusion resistance, Rd, to the DSSC, which will result in a decreased ff. In addition, the resistance associated with slow electron-transfer kinetics at the counter electrode, RPt, can contribute to a poor ff. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, EIS, is a powerful technique which can be used to determine the extent to which each of these resistances, as well as other processes detailed below, affects the cell performance. EIS consists of the measurement of the alternating current response when a small (5 mV) alternating potential perturbation is applied on top of the steady state potential. Resulting impedance spectra can be fitted to an appropriate equivalent circuit, such as the one shown in Fig. 11a, which has been shown to accurately describe the behavior of DSSCs.35,63,102 In this model, RS is the total series resistance of the cell accounting for the FTO sheet resistance as well as the solution resistance, RT is the electron transport resistance through the nanoparticle TiO2 film, RCT is the charge transfer resistance of charge recombination between electrons in the TiO2 and the oxidized form of the redox shuttle in solution, Cμ is the chemical capacitance of the TiO2 film, Zd is a Warburg diffusion element representing the impedance due to the diffusion of the redox shuttle through the electrolyte, RPt is the charge transfer resistance at the counter electrode and CPt is the double layer capacitance at the counter electrode.

In order to demonstrate the effects of each of the resistances associated with outersphere shuttles on the photovoltaic behavior, EIS was performed under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2) on a DSSC employing the [Co(t-Bu2bpy)3]3+/2+ redox shuttle (experimental details are provided in the supporting information†).42,63 A characteristic impedance spectrum is shown in Fig. 11b. Three overlapping semicircular impedance features are present which are associated with charge transfer at the counter electrode, charge transfer at the photoanode (recombination), and diffusion of the redox species, as labeled in the figure. In order to extract the resistances associated with each process, the spectra were fitted to the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 11a.69 A constant phase element, CPE, was used to better fit the impedance spectra for Cμ as commonly used for porous electrodes.63,69 The magnitude of the diffusion resistance, Rd, can be determined from the Warburg element, which is used to describe diffusion, following the equation: (28)where ω is the frequency of the a.c. perturbation, and ωd (=l2Do) is the characteristic frequency of diffusion. The Rd values obtained from EIS, displayed in Fig. 11c, show how the mass transport resistance decreases as the current decreases, as expected. Due to the poor electron-transfer kinetics between [Co(t-Bu2bpy)3]3+/2+ and platinum, the charge transfer resistance at the platinized counter electrode, RPt, is another significant source of resistance. Values of RPt varied slightly with electrode preparation conditions, but were generally in the range of 70–100 Ω. Choosing an alternative material for the counter electrode can minimize RPt. For example, gold has been found to exhibit faster kinetics than platinum with such cobalt complexes and is thus often used as the counter electrode material.47,73,99,103,104
The J–V curve of the DSSC investigated with EIS is displayed in Fig. 11d. The fill factor is 0.49, consistent with what has been previously reported.42,47,63,73,97,99,104 The J–V curve can be corrected for the two resistance losses, Rd and RPt, by subtracting the ohmic drop, IR, from the applied potential, Vapp, according to Vcorr = Vapp − IR. The resultant J–Vcorr curve is displayed in Fig. 11d. After correcting for RPt and Rd, an increase in the ff from 0.49 to 0.7 is produced. Overcoming these resistive processes would thus represent an improvement in efficiency of 43%. The series resistance of ∼45 Ω was not included in the correction since that is not necessarily a result of the redox shuttle, but most likely a general feature of cell design/fabrication. Further corrections including the series resistance would bring the ff close to the ideal value of ∼0.8 (calculated using eqn (15) with Rs = 0, γ = 1, and the pre-exponential terms adjusted to produce Voc = 0.55 V) consistent with a diode quality factor close to 1.
Conclusions
Redox shuttles strongly affect several important aspects of photovoltaic performance. The triiodide/iodide redox shuttle has exhibited unmatched performance thus far due to the unique combination of fast regeneration (of N3), slow recombination, and high solubility/diffusion coefficient. The reliance on triiodide/iodide, however, complicates detailed understanding of the fundamental processes involving it. As a result, there remain many important unanswered questions. For example, the mechanism of regeneration by I−, including the identity of intermediate complexes, of dyes other than N3/N719 are not known. The identity of the dominant acceptor species is still under debate, and as a result the recombination mechanism is not fully understood. The role of the intermediate I2− in regeneration and recombination has only recently been addressed. It has also not been fully demonstrated what role surface states play in recombination. While it is difficult to match iodide’s performance, one electron outersphere redox shuttles are good model systems to probe the mechanism of DSSCs. Further systematic studies are needed; however it appears that the regeneration and recombination reactions can be generally understood in terms of Marcus formalism, thus providing a rational framework for the implementation of new redox systems. It is our hope that such advancements will enable DSSCs to be a viable technology for widespread use and ultimately compete with electricity generated from fossil fuel combustion.

 	Fig. 1  a) Approximate energy diagram displaying the major kinetic processes in the operation of DSSCs described in the text. The k3 and Do arrows indicate the positive processes involving the redox shuttle, the k5 arrow indicates the deleterious process involving the redox shuttle, and the remaining arrows represent processes independent of the redox shuttle. b) Schematic of a DSSC device indicating the relevant processes of the redox shuttle described in the text: regeneration (k3), diffusion (Do), and recombination (k5). The tortuous path of the oxidized redox shuttle is depicted; however, the actual path is much longer and more complicated.
