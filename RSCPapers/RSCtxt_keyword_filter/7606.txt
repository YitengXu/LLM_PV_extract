    , Accepted 20th April 2017First published on 20th April 2017AbstractIn recently developed high-efficiency metal organometal halide perovskite solar cells (PVSCs), electron and hole transporting materials have shown key roles in determining the growth of perovskite crystals, as well as the performance and stability of the device. However, interlayer materials which can facilitate both high efficiency and stability at low cost are still limited. Here, we demonstrate that, by controlling the thickness of solution-processed graphene oxide (GO), one can achieve a balance of high work function and conductivity. Using GO with the optimized thickness as a hole-transporting material (HTM) in PVSCs, a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.5% with no hysteresis has been achieved with excellent light-soaking photocurrent stability in comparison with a commonly used organic-based HTM. Under high humidity and continuous light soaking, the encapsulated perovskite devices retained >80% of their initial efficiency for >2000 h. Detailed studies on the GO binding energy, charge transfer efficiency with perovskite, and crystal morphology shed light on the origin of the observed improvement in photovoltaic performance. Benefiting from the merits of low temperature, solution processability and low cost, the proposed GO fabrication methods could aid scalable production of PVSCs with high PCE and excellent stability.
Introduction
Since the first observation of the photovoltaic (PV) effect from hybrid halide perovskites, the emerging field of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) has become one of the most promising technologies for the next-generation thin-film photovoltaics.1–3 As “harvesters” of light, perovskites (e.g., MAPbI3, MA: CH3NH3) have a combination of low-cost manufacturing and competitive PV efficiency.4,5 These features can be ascribed to the ease of solution-based fabrication processes and excellent photophysical properties, such as a high absorption coefficient, long charge-carrier lifetimes, long charge diffusion lengths, and photon recycling.6–8 Over recent years, PVSCs have exhibited a rapid increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of >22%.9
To realize the PV effect of PVSCs, two types of device architectures have been proposed according to the transporting behaviors of photo-generated carriers: the n–i–p structure inherited from dye-sensitized solar cells10–13 and the inverted p–i–n structure by mimicking the design concept of organic solar cells.14,15 Although the conventional n–i–p structure dominates most of the best PCE, inverted p–i–n PVSCs have also attracted extensive attention due to their better compatibility with scalable and low-temperature fabrication process.16 One typical inverted PVSC can be fabricated with the configuration of a transparent anode electrode/hole-transporting layer (HTL)/perovskite/electron-transporting layer (ETL)/cathode electrode.17 It has been shown that the HTL plays a very crucial part in inverted PVSCs. First, the morphology, crystallization, and conditions of the crystal boundary of perovskites are strongly dependent on the HTL employed, upon which the perovskite grows directly.18 Second, appropriate electrical and electronic properties of the interface between HTL and perovskite are needed to facilitate carrier extraction and collection while minimizing the charge recombination.19 Third, the reliability and chemical compatibility of the hole-transporting material (HTM) should also be taken into account to guarantee the long-term stability of the device.20 In addition, other factors must be considered if a HTM is used in inverted PVSCs: hydrophobic properties, UV light cutoff, and the costs of raw materials and processing.21 Consequently, to achieve good PV performance of inverted PVSCs in terms of lower cost per watt and better device stability for commercial uses, it is of vital importance to rationally design the HTL with appropriate material and processing to minimize the energy mismatch in a reliable and cost-effective HTL/perovskite interface for efficient carrier extraction.22
In fact, it is very challenging for a single HTM to satisfy all of the desirable requirements mentioned above. In inverted PVSCs, the most popular HTM is poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS).23 Owing to the appropriate energy level, good mobility and good transparency in visible and near-infrared regions, PEDOT:PSS has demonstrated continuous success in delivering high PCE. However, the organic PEDOT:PSS is sensitive to oxygen and especially to moisture in comparison with its inorganic counterparts.24 Furthermore, PEDOT:PSS has high acidity and hygroscopic properties, leading to detrimental effects in device stability.25 To overcome these problems, many efforts have focused on searching alternative HTM to PEDOT:PSS. Inorganic materials such as CuSCN and NiOx have been introduced into inverted PVSCs with decent PV performance.26,27 However, CuSCN-based PVSCs show poor device stability, and NiOx-based PVSCs usually require high-temperature treatment, vacuum-based processing or complicated doping protocols, which increase the processing cost and complexity for device manufacturing.28 Recently, a new organic HTM, Trux-OMeTAD, was designed by introducing triarylamine and aliphatic side-chains onto the C3h Truxene-core.29 The excellent PV performance in terms of PCE ≤ 18.6% and good stability were achieved, but a complicated synthetic process and relatively high cost may hinder application of Trux-OMeTAD in scalable production of PVSCs. Obviously, PVSCs are still suffering from a lack of well-qualified HTM. Thus, it is an urgent need to develop low-cost and simply processed interfacial materials that can balance high transparency, good passivation properties, high conductivity, adequate work function (WF) and, more importantly, better stability.
Recently, graphene oxide (GO) has been applied in various thin-film electronic devices as interlayer materials.30–32 GO can be prepared simply using a solution-based process with cost-effective raw materials.33 It is self-stable and has no reaction to perovskites films. However, it is challenging using GO in PVSCs to obtain high WF and conductivity. The high WF can lead to ohmic contact and enhance the build-in potential for a higher open circuit voltage (VOC). The high conductivity can guarantee high charge collection efficiency and high short-circuit current density (JSC). Intrinsically, GO has a high degree of oxygen contents, which results in high WF, but such high oxygen contents GO has extremely low conductivity that cannot be used as a HTL in PVSCs.34 To achieve optimal PV performance, WF and conductivity must be delicately balanced in GO for PVSCs. To increase the conductivity of GO, various chemically driven reduction approaches have been adopted to lower the oxygen contents.35 Although encouraging PV performance has been obtained by using such reduced GO, the reduction processes would lower the WF and result in poor PV performance. In addition, the reduction process complicates device fabrication and certain reducing agents and surfactants are toxic and explosive,32 leading to its inappropriateness in scalable production. Alternatively, as adopted in this work, the reduction reaction of GO can be done in thin films with moderate annealing at a low temperature in air. By carefully controlling the time, the conductivity can be enhanced without affecting the high WF of the as-prepared GO film. It is believed that this simple fabrication process to balance the WF and conductivity can facilitate the application of GO as a HTL in PVSCs at low cost. One pioneer study has shown that using GO as an alternative for PEDOT:PSS in PVSCs can lead to improved PCE.30 However, the reported highest efficiency in GO-based PVSCs is only 12% (ref. 30, 36 and 37) and no further study on the stability of GO-based PVSC has been done. In fact, a detailed study on the origin of such improvement in PV performance in GO-based PVSCs is lacking.
Here, we report that by optimizing the thickness of a GO thin film as a HTL in planar inverted PVSCs, high PCE (≤16.5%) can be achieved. Compared with conventional PEDOT:PSS HTL, GO-based devices have a significant improvement in continuous light soaking and shelf-lifetime stabilities. The devices retain >80% of initial PCE after a 2000 h stability test. This improvement is contributed by a higher WF of GO and larger perovskite crystals. Furthermore, steady-state PL and transient photocurrent results support the notion that the GO/perovskite interface has better hole-extraction efficiency than the PEDOT:PSS/perovskite interface.
Results and discussion
Inverted PVSCs with an active area of 0.1 cm2 were prepared with the configuration of glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/HTL/perovskite/fullerene (C60)/BCP/Au. The schematic of the device configuration is shown in Fig. 1a. Notably, two HTMs, i.e., GO and PEDOT:PSS, were used for comparison. Similar to PEDOT:PSS, the GO HTM can also be deposited on ITO glass at room temperature using solution process. This is attributed to the numerous polar functional groups (as shown in Fig. S1†) bonded on GO sheets, which allow GO to be easily dispersed into various polar solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or deionized (DI) water. In particular, in this work, GO suspensions in DI water at 0.3 mg mL−1 were prepared and the GO film was deposited onto the ITO glass substrate by spin-coating method. The surface morphology of GO and PEDOT:PSS films on the ITO substrate was characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 1b). The GO film had a root mean square roughness of 0.59 nm, which was smaller than that of PEDOT:PSS film (1.53 nm). The smoother surface of the GO film could provide good contact with the perovskite layer, leading to optimal growth of perovskites with larger grain sizes and high-quality crystallization. After deposition of the films, WFs of GO and PEDOT:PSS were analysed using ultra-violet photoelectron spectra (UPS) (Fig. 1c). Clearly, the prepared GO had higher WF (5.2 eV) than PEDOT:PSS (4.9 eV), implying that GO was more appropriate to form an ohmic contact with the perovskite active layer and that a higher VOC could be expected. Fig. 1d shows the energy level diagram of PVSCs using GO or PEDOT:PSS as the HTL. It has been demonstrated that minimizing the energy-level mismatch between the HTL and perovskite reduces photovoltage loss and promotes carrier extraction and collection efficiency.36

To further investigate the GO/perovskite interface, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and transient photocurrent measurement were used to study the quenching and charge collection efficiencies of perovskite on GO, respectively. Fig. 2a exhibits the PL spectra of perovskite thin films deposited on different thicknesses of GO and PEDOT:PSS, respectively. Obviously, compared with PEDOT:PSS as the HTL, the perovskite PL intensity was reduced dramatically with GO as the HTL. This observation indicates that the photogenerated holes in perovskite are transferred more easily to GO because it is expected that GO has a better energy level match with the perovskite. Conversely, with PEDOT:PSS as the HTL, the photogenerated holes were more confined in the perovskite layer due to the interfacial energy barrier and, therefore, high PL intensity. The transient photocurrent results were consistent with the PL results (Fig. 2b). A faster photocurrent decay in perovskite was observed with GO as the HTL. This finding suggests that the photogenerated holes in the perovskite were transferred more easily to GO, which has a higher WF than PEDOT:PSS as measured by photoemission spectroscopy. It also indicates that GO can more effectively extract the carriers from perovskite layers and reduce the carrier recombination because rapid carrier collection prevents charge accumulation at the interface of perovskite with the GO charge extraction layer. With increasing GO thickness, the carrier extraction efficiency decreased, which might have been caused by the poor conductivity of the thicker GO layer.

The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics under AM1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 of the planar-inverted PVSCs using PEDOT:PSS or GO as the HTL are shown in Fig. 3a. The PV parameters determined from these PVSCs are also summarized in Table 1. The PEDOT:PSS-based device exhibited a PCE of 11.9% with a VOC of 0.96 V, a JSC of 18.8 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 65.7%. When PEDOT:PSS was replaced by GO, the PCE was remarkably increased to 16.5% with a VOC of 1.00 V, a JSC of 21.6 mA cm−2, and a FF of 76.2%. The morphology of the perovskite absorber layer plays a very crucial part in determining the performance of PVSCs. Formation of a high-quality and crystallized perovskite is strongly dependent on the substrate where it will grow and the processing parameters. Fig. 3b shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the perovskite films deposited on PEDOT:PSS and GO substrates, respectively. A dense and uniform perovskite layer with grain sizes of 500–1000 nm was formed on top of the GO layer. In contrast, the perovskite domains were much smaller when perovskite grew on the PEDOT:PSS substrate, an observation that agreed well with the work of Huang et al.21 Indeed, it has been verified that a compact and well-crystallized perovskite film with grain size larger than a few hundred nanometers is necessary to achieve a high PCE of PVSC. It is because the larger grains can effectively suppress charge recombination due to their reduced concentration of grain boundaries.21 Therefore, the larger perovskite crystals obtained in GO-based devices were believed to lead to an improved PV performance. The different growth mechanisms of perovskite on GO and PEDOT:PSS were caused by various surface properties of GO and PEDOT:PSS, such as wettability or morphology. It has been reported that graphene can act as an effective template to nucleate small organic molecules at the grain boundaries of graphene and form a large crystal.38 Accordingly, it can be extrapolated that the suppressed nuclei formation of CH3NH3PbI3 on top of the GO substrate that leads to a slower growth rate compared with the perovskite film growing on a PEDOT:PSS substrate. The crystal quality of perovskite films growing on GO and PEDOT:PSS substrates were also studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig. 3c). The perovskite films growing on GO and PEDOT:PSS exhibited similar XRD patterns, indicating a tetragonal perovskite structure. Notably, the GO-based perovskite film showed stronger and narrower XRD peaks; the (110) peak showed a full width at half maximum (FWHM) value of 0.13, which was 19% smaller than that of PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3 (FWHM = 0.16), and this result was consistent with the larger perovskite grains observed by SEM in Fig. 3b.

As mentioned above, the intrinsic GO has low conductivity due to a high level of oxygen contents. To achieve the optimal PV performance based on a good balance between the WF and conductivity in GO, the thickness of GO films is carefully tailored by layer-by-layer deposition to optimize the conductivity for PVSCs. The PV performance of devices with various GO thicknesses are shown in Fig. 4 and summarized in Table 1. As expected, the PV performance of PVSCs were significantly improved when the GO thickness decreased from 10 nm to 2 nm. This observation can be ascribed to two reasons. First, a thinner GO film has higher conductivity and smaller device series resistance (the corresponding series resistance of a perovskite solar cell with different thickness in the GO interlayer calculated from J–V curves is shown in Table 1). Second, a thinner GO film would help to minimize carrier recombination. As a result, a dramatically enhanced JSC and FF can be anticipated with a thinner GO HTL. Besides the conductivity, a thinner GO film also has higher optical transmittance, leading to more photogenerated carriers. Consequently, better PV performance can be achieved by combining the high WF with the optimized conductivity and transparency by simply tuning the GO film thickness.

J–V curve of perovskite solar cells with different thickness of the GO buffer layer. 
To further investigate the origin of such improvement of PV performance, measurement of external quantum efficiency (EQE) was performed. Fig. 5a shows the EQE results of different PVSCs based on GO and PEDOT:PSS. The integrated current for these two interlayer materials was 18.5 and 20.8 mA cm−2, respectively, which matched well with the JSC extracted from the J–V curve. The EQE spectrum of the GO-based device demonstrated a similar profile with that of the PEDOT:PSS-based device. Interestingly, the EQE intensity in the range of 700–800 nm was significantly enhanced with GO as the HTL. In order to investigate the enhanced JSC, measurement of the optical reflectance of the device was performed to gain deeper insight into the optical absorption of the active layer in devices. As shown in Fig. 5b, employment of GO could effectively reduce the reflectance in both UV (350–450 nm) and visible regions (650–800 nm). The reduced reflectance implied an enhanced optical absorption and better utilization of incident photons for higher JSC. In addition, a viable HTM should also facilitate more stable device performance. We sought to test the stability of GO-based PVSCs with steady-state photocurrent to evaluate the photo-stability and the shelf aging test to explore the device lifetime under ambient humidity. Measurement of steady-state photocurrent aims to identify the actual power output and accurate characterize device efficiency. As shown in Fig. 5c, the photocurrent increased quickly to a maximum for devices using GO or PEDOT:PSS as the HTL, and the steady-state current was identical to that measured from J–V scanning. The photocurrent of the PEDOT:PSS-based device dramatically decreased when extending the light illumination to several-hundred seconds. In sharp contrast, the photocurrent of the GO-based device remained nearly invariant even when the illumination duration was prolonged to 3000 s. Obviously, the GO-based device had better photo-stability than the device employing PEDOT:PSS as the HTL during continuous light illumination.

To further demonstrate the potential of GO in the improvement of device stability, the long-term aging test under ambient humidity with a relative humidity of ≈60% was conducted. The devices used in the stability test were encapsulated within a glovebox immediately after the fabrication. After the initial J–V measurements, the devices were illuminated continuously and then stored in the dark under standard laboratory conditions. Fig. 6a shows the parameters of PCE, FF, JSC and VOC of the GO-based and PEDOT:PSS-based devices over a long-term storage/operation. The PCE of the PEDOT:PSS-based device decreased rapidly to 40% of the initial PCE after just 1400 h. Surprisingly, the GO-based device showed much better long-term stability. Its PCE decreased by only 10% after nearly 2000 h. Such a remarkable difference suggests that GO could enhance the stability of PVSCs efficaciously. The VOC remained almost unchanged during the testing processes for storage and operation. Degradation arose mainly from the JSC and FF. The J–V characteristics of the two devices were measured after different durations of operation/storage (Fig. 6b and c). The J–V characteristic of the PEDOT:PSS-based device decayed continuously but the J–V characteristic of the GO-based PVSCs showed few changes after ≈80 days of storage and operation.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated highly efficient and stable PVSCs with a simple solution and room temperature-processed GO as HTMs. By combining the high WF and optimized thickness of a GO thin film, GO-based PVSCs can achieve a high PCE of 16.5% with excellent device stability, which is superior to the reference device with the commonly used PEDOT:PSS as the HTM. The improvement in PV performance is attributed to the larger grain size of perovskite growing on a GO film, enhanced charge collection efficiency with better alignment of interfacial energy, and higher optical absorption of the active layer. More importantly, the stability of PVSCs using GO as the HTL is significantly improved in light soaking test. Overall, our results demonstrate that GO, without any other post-treatment processing, is an efficient and reliable interfacial material to facilitate low-cost and highly stable PVSCs.
Experimental section
GO was prepared from graphite powder by a modified version of the Hummers' method.39 Briefly, 0.45 g of KNO3 and 17 mL of concentrated H2SO4 were added to 0.5 g of graphite powder cooling in an ice bath. The mixture was slowly added to 2.25 g of KMnO4 for 1 h with continuous stirring. The solution was left to stir for an extra 2 h in the ice bath, and then removed and kept for 5 days with continuous stirring to insert sufficient functional groups, such as –COOH and –OH. A black viscous liquid was obtained and added to a 50 mL aqueous solution of 5 wt% HCl over 1 h with continuous stirring. After the mixture had been stirred for a further 2 h, 1.5 g of H2O2 (30 wt% aqueous) was added and the mixture left to stir for another 2 h. Then, the material was washed with DI water for several times until the pH value of the slurry was close to 7. Then, the products was freeze-dried for 2 days. In this work, a GO concentration of 0.3 mg mL−1 was prepared by adding DI water into the as-synthesized solid.
Device fabrication: The PVSCs were fabricated on an ITO substrate (15 Ω sq−1). The substrates were cleaned sequentially with detergent, DI water, isopropanol, and acetone in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min and then dried by nitrogen gas. Before coating the HTLs, ITO substrates were finally cleaned under UV-ozone treatment for 10 min. A HTL (PEDOT:PSS or GO) was deposited onto the substrates by spin-coating with a spin speed of 4000 rpm for 40 s. The layer of PEDOT:PSS was dried on a hotplate at 150 °C for 15 min in air. Compared with the PEDOT:PSS layer, the GO film was dried at 50 °C for 10 min in air.
Perovskite precursor solution and film preparation: the precursor solution was prepared by dissolving PbI2 (462 mg mL−1) in anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF) while stirring at 70 °C overnight. Methylammonium iodide (MAI) was dissolved in anhydrous isopropanol at 35 mg mL−1. The PbI2 layer was spin-coated on top of PEDOT:PSS and GO-modified ITO substrates at 4000 rpm for 40 s. PbI2 films were annealed on a hotplate at 70 °C for 10 min immediately after spin-coating. The MAI solution was added onto the PbI2 films for 90 s before spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 40 s. Finally, the perovskite films were solvent-annealed (in DMF) at 100 °C for 1 h. Then, the perovskite films were transferred from the glove box into a vacuum chamber and C60 (20 nm), BCP (5 nm) and Au (80 nm) layers were sequentially deposited on the CH3NH3PbI3 film by thermal evaporation under a base pressure of 10−4 Pa. The active area of the devices was 0.10 cm2.
