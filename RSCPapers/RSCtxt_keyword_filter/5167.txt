    , Accepted 2nd March 2022First published on 8th March 2022AbstractDeveloping efficient organic solar cells (OSCs) with strong mechanical deformability is important to be addressed to ensure their operational reliability in wearable electronics. However, it is challenging to achieve mechanically robust polymer/small molecule OSCs with an efficiency over 17% due to the abundant brittle donor/acceptor (D/A) interface. Decreasing the small molecule content can reduce the brittle D/A interface area to enhance deformability, but it may also cause discontinuous electron-conducting regions and thus deteriorate photovoltaic performance. Here, we incorporate a polymer donor (D18) into a binary PTQ10cm-BTP-PhC6 system at a constant PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 ratio of 1:1.2 to minimize the D/A interfacial area and modulate phase separation, and subsequently fabricate mechanically reliable OSCs with high efficiency. The large incorporation of D18 molecules increases the crystallinity of m-BTP-PhC6 molecules because of the poor interaction between D18 and the two host materials, affording sufficient pathways for efficient charge percolation at a large D/A ratio. More importantly, highly aggregated m-BTP-PhC6 molecules help to minimize the D/A interfacial area, enabling ternary films with better deformability than their binary counterparts. As a result, ternary OSCs with a large D/A ratio of 1.5:1.2 exhibit a high efficiency of 17.3% with a crack-onset strain (COS) of 8.8%, which significantly outperforms their binary counterparts with an efficiency of 13.8% and a COS of 4.4%. Diluting the content of small molecules and controlling intermolecular interaction through the introduction of the second polymer donor represents a promising strategy to fabricate efficient OSCs with superior deformability.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) with strong mechanical robustness and superior power conversion efficiency (PCE) are highly desirable for next-generation mobile power supply equipment and diverse Internet of things (IoT) applications.1–3 Plenty of strategies including molecular structure innovation and morphology optimization have been successfully applied to boost the efficiency of OSCs to around 17–19%.4–12 However, these strategies typically fail to enhance the mechanical properties of the active layers.13,14 For instance, increasing the backbone planarity, which is generally regarded as a feasible molecular design rule to improve charge transport ability along the conjugated plane to enhance the photon-to-electron conversion efficiency, always deteriorates the mechanical performance since it makes molecules less deformable.13 Similarly, morphology optimization for efficient OSCs has mainly followed the rule of increasing the crystallinity to decrease charge trap formation, which always embrittles the films by weakening the linkage between different crystallized regions.14,15 This mutual contradiction between the mechanical and photovoltaic properties significantly impedes progress in the fabrication of high-efficiency and mechanically durable OSCs.
Researchers have made tremendous efforts to improve mechanical properties without compromising the photovoltaic performances, such as incorporating insulating elastomers and constructing all polymer solar cells with a high molecular weight. Ye and coworkers tried to add an insulating elastomer SEBS into the PM6/N3 system to help dissipate the external stress on semiconducting films.16 The crack-onset strain (COS) of active layers could be enhanced from 6.9% to 11.2% for those without and with 10% SEBS content incorporation; however, the PCE also dropped from 15.4% to 14.2% at the same time because of the large self-aggregated SEBS region. Kim and coworkers replaced elastomers with fullerene as the third component to overcome the PCE decrease caused by the insulating characteristics of elastomers. As a result, the efficiency showed an enhancement from 5.91% to 6.80% with 30% fullerene addition. Nevertheless, the stretchability of the active layers slightly decreased due to the brittle nature of fullerene.17 Replacing the brittle small molecules with a high molecular weight polymer acceptor to introduce strong intermolecular chain entanglements is another common strategy to construct mechanically robust OSCs. However, the mechanically robust all-polymer photoactive films have only been able to return a device efficiency of no more than 11%,18–22 which is far lower than that reported for all polymer OSCs with an efficiency around 14–15%.23–28 The relatively poor PCE stems from the high molecular weight which is indispensable to introduce a large number of chain entanglements,29 which could induce poor morphology with large domains as reported by Min et al.24 Therefore, deformable OSCs with high efficiency, especially those with PCEs reaching the requirement of practical applications (over 17%), are barely reported.21,30,31
Polymer:small molecule solar cells are the most suitable candidate to be used as wearable OSCs in the future in terms of their extremely superior efficiency compared with their all polymer or all small molecule counterparts. However, blending a polymer donor with a small molecule acceptor always results in a significant deterioration of deformability even if the neat polymer donor films are very ductile.13 The brittleness of small molecules, caused by their strong tendency to form strong crystalline packing and the lack of effective intermolecular entanglements, easily makes the film crack because of the small molecule-rich region in the blend.21,31–33 It is reasonable to increase the deformability by decreasing the relative content of small molecules to reduce the vulnerable portion of the active layer. Following this, Lipomi and coworkers tried to improve the mechanical strength of P3HpT:PCBM by varying the content of PCBM.13 As a result, COS of the blend films was enhanced from 4% to 16% when the relative donor:acceptor (D/A) ratio decreased from 1:0.5 to 1:0.25. However, discontinuous electron-conducting regions induced by an insufficient content of PCBM also led to a significant loss in photovoltaic performance. Therefore, how to maintain the continuous interpenetrating network at a large D/A ratio in high-efficiency OSCs needs to be systematically explored.
In this work, a PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 binary system was selected as the model system to explore the effect of a gradually increased D/A ratio on morphology and thus on the mechanical and photovoltaic performance. Because of the amorphous characteristics of PTQ10, increasing the content of PTQ10 significantly inhibited the crystallization of m-BTP-PhC6 in binary PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 films, leading to a significant drop in PCE from 16.9% for a 1:1.2 ratio to 13.8% for a 1.5:1.2 ratio even if the COS value increased from 1.3 ± 0.3% to 3.8 ± 0.6%. To weaken the inhibition effect on m-BTP-PhC6 crystallization, a highly crystalline polymer donor (D18) was incorporated into the PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 host system when the PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 ratio was maintained as 1:1.2 to simultaneously enhance the mechanical and photovoltaic performance. Impressively, the efficiency of ternary OSCs with the PTQ10:D18:m-BTP-PhC6 ratio as 1:0.5:1.2 (totally 1.5:1.2) remarkably increased from the corresponding binary films of 13.8% to 17.3%, together with the COS enhanced from 3.8 ± 0.6% to 8.4 ± 0.4% (highest 8.8%). The improvement in PCE was mainly attributed to the stronger crystallinity of m-BTP-PhC6 in ternary films and thus enhanced electron mobility compared with its binary counterpart. Detailed analysis revealed that D18 exhibited poor interaction with m-BTP-PhC6, which can liberate m-BTP-PhC6 molecules from the PTQ10 domain. More importantly, the concentrated m-BTP-PhC6 region in ternary blend films offers a smaller D/A interface where cracks easily form and propagate, resulting in much enhanced deformability compared to their binary counterparts with the same D/A ratio. It should be noticed that an efficiency of 17.3% is the highest value reported in mechanically robust OSCs (with COS over 5%). Our work provides a useful guideline in diluting the small molecule content to design deformable OSCs with high efficiency from the view of interaction modulation.
Results and discussion
The molecular structures of PTQ10, D18 and m-BTP-PhC6 are shown in Fig. 1a and the corresponding energy levels are shown in Fig. 1b. Fig. 1c presents the absorption spectra of neat PTQ10, D18 and m-BTP-PhC6 films. PTQ10 and m-BTP-PhC6 exhibit strong absorption at 500–650 nm (absorption peak at 602 nm) and 600–900 nm (absorption peak at 804 nm). The third component D18 displays main absorption in the range of 400–600 nm with the absorption peak located at 582 nm. The absorption spectrum of PTQ10:D18 blend films with different D18 contents is shown in Fig. S1.† A stronger absorption in the range of 500–550 nm can be observed in blend films, together with a slight blue shift of the PTQ10 absorption peak because of the addition of D18.

We first compared the effect of an increased D/A ratio on the photovoltaic performance in binary and ternary systems, using conventional devices with the architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINO/Al. In this work, the D/A ratio in the binary PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 system was changed from 1:1.2 to 1.2:1.2, 1.5:1.2 and 1.7:1.2. Correspondingly, ternary PTQ10:D18:m-BTP-PhC6 blends with a total D/A ratio of 1.2:1.2 (1:0.2:1.2), 1.5:1.2 (1:0.5:1.2) and 1.7:1.2 (1:0.7:1.2) were fabricated by increasing the D18 content when the PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 relative ratio was maintained as 1:1.2. The J–V curves of these devices are shown in Fig. 2a and S2† and the relative detailed photovoltaic parameters are displayed in Table 1 and S1.† Binary PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 and D18:m-BTP-PhC6 exhibit a PCE of 16.7 ± 0.1% and 16.6 ± 0.1%, respectively. This PCE for PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 is comparable with the value (16.5 ± 0.2%) reported by Cui and coworkers with the same active layer.34 Meanwhile, this is the first time that a mixture of D18 with m-BTP-PhC6 as the active layer to fabricate OSCs has been reported. For the binary PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 system, the best PCE decreased from 16.9% to 16.3%, 13.8% and 11.5% when the D/A ratio gradually increased from the optimized D/A ratio of 1:1.2 to 1.7:1.2. In contrast, the corresponding ternary OSCs with a total D/A ratio of 1.2:1.2, 1.5:1.2 and 1.7:1.2 exhibited much higher efficiencies of 17.6%, 17.3% and 16.7% due to the remarkable enhancement in Jsc and the fill factor (FF). The best photovoltaic performance for the ternary PTQ10:D18:m-BTP-PhC6 system is achieved at a D/A ratio of 1:0.2:1.2 with the highest PCE of 17.6%, which is lower than the PCE of PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6:PC71BM because of the different post treatments we used. The obvious promotion of EQE in the range from 650 to 810 nm (the absorption range of m-BTP-PhC6) overserved in the ternary system corresponds well with their much higher photocurrent compared with the binary system with the same total D/A ratio (Fig. 2b and S3†). To better understand the enhancement of Jsc at a large D/A ratio in ternary systems when compared with their BHJ counterparts, we measured the absorption coefficient of D18 and PTQ10 films (Fig. S4†). The absorption coefficients of D18 and PTQ10 are 9.26 × 104 cm−1 and 8.67 × 104 cm−1, respectively. The higher absorption coefficient of D18 enables ternary films with enhanced light harvesting ability with a large D/A ratio compared to their BHJ counterparts, which correspond well with the higher EQE response in the range from 450 to 550 nm for ternary blends.

To understand the underlying mechanism of the better D/A ratio tolerance on the FF in the ternary system, device physics processes including charge transport and collection were analyzed. Mobility measured through space-charge-limited current (SCLC) is shown in Fig. 2c and S4.† In binary PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6, the electron mobility of the blends decreases with an increasing D/A ratio, together with enhancement of the hole mobility (μh):electron mobility (μe) ratio from 0.75 of 1:1.2 to 4.08 of 1.7:1.2. This unbalanced μh:μe results in severe charge recombination and thus a lower FF and Jsc. However, only a small variation of electron mobility can be observed in ternary films as the D/A ratio increases. Consequently, ternary blends show a stable and balanced μh:μe ranging from 1.12 to 1.21 along with an increased D/A ratio, corresponding well to their high FF. We then measured the dependence of Voc on light intensity (P) to study trap-assisted recombination (Fig. 2d and S5a†).35 The slope of Voc against Plight for binary PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 with different D/A ratios significantly increased from 1.019kT/q of 1:1.2 to 1.215kT/q of 1.7:1.2, suggesting that trap-assisted recombination is more significant in large D/A ratio devices. As for ternary blend films, the slope is close to 1kT/q against different D/A ratios, illustrating that only weak trap-assisted recombination occurs in these devices. The JSCversus light intensity (P) plots which follow a power-law formula of Jsc ∝ PSlight were recorded to analyze bimolecular recombination (Fig. 2e and S5b†).36–38 The calculated exponent S for four binary PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 films slightly drops from 0.957 ± 0.002 of 1:1.2 to 0.943 ± 0.002 of 1.7:1.2, demonstrating that bimolecular recombination becomes more severe with an increment in the D/A ratio. The higher exponent S for the three ternary blends in all three D/A ratios is in good agreement with their superior PCE.
To better explain the change of photocurrent in binary and ternary films with various D/A ratios, we compared the exciton dissociation and charge collection properties through measuring photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) (Fig. 2f and S5c†). Jph represents the difference between JL and JD, where JL and JD are the current density values under standard illumination conditions and in the dark, respectively. Veff is defined as the variation between V0 and Vbias, in which V0 is the voltage value when Jph is zero and Vbias is the external voltage bias value.39 Exciton dissociation probabilities (Pdiss) of the four binary PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 devices are 95.6%, 93.3%, 92.3% and 91.9%, while these three ternary blends possess a similar Pdiss around 96% when the D/A ratio increased. Poor Pdiss obtained in binary devices with a high D/A ratio correlates well with the much deteriorated photocurrent. The lower photoluminescence (PL) quenching efficiency in binary films than that in their ternary counterparts revealed by the PL spectra (Fig. S6†) also confirmed deteriorated exciton dissociation in the binary system when the D/A ratio increased. Therefore, the higher exciton dissociation probability as well as the more efficient quenching efficiency all prove that the incorporation of D18 helps the ternary blends to maintain a stable photocurrent at a larger D/A ratio.
After checking the dependence of photovoltaic performance on an increased D/A ratio in binary and ternary systems, we measured the stress–strain curves of these films using film on water (FOW) tensile measurement44 to illuminate the effect of a changing D/A ratio on mechanical properties. The diagram of the FOW tensile test, where the measured films are floated on water and the load and displacement recording elements are adhered to these films, is shown in Fig. 3a. We first compared the mechanical properties of the three materials used in this work. Unfortunately, the stress–strain curves of pure m-BTP-PhC6 could not be successfully recorded by the FOW test as a result of its brittleness, making it crack when the film was floating on water.45 PTQ10 and D18 used in this work have number-average molecular weights within a similar range to minimize the impact of molecular weight on material properties (Fig. S7†).46–48 Because of the high molecular weight, both neat PTQ10 and D18 films can induce sufficient intermolecular entanglements, and thus are highly mechanically stretchable with a COS of 50.1 ± 5.2% and 28.3 ± 2.9%, respectively (Fig. 3b). Nonetheless, blending m-BTP-PhC6 with highly ductile PTQ10 or D18 still returns a limited mechanical deformability (Fig. 3c and d) (a COS of 1.3 ± 0.3% and elastic modulus (Ef) of 0.878 ± 0.042 GPa for PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 and a COS of 1.2 ± 0.2% and Ef of 1.048 ± 0.065 GPa for D18:m-BTP-PhC6). This significant embrittlement after mixing with m-BTP-PhC6 is caused by the introduction of a brittle interfacial area, where cracks tend to form and propagate due to the remarkable difference of elastic modulus between the ductile polymer and brittle small molecules.49 Increasing the D/A ratio in binary PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 softens the blend films with a higher COS and lower Ef value (Fig. 3d and S8†) as the result of a smaller D/A interface caused by the diluted m-BTP-PhC6 content. Unexpectedly, the mechanical performance of ternary systems with the same D/A ratio outperformed their binary counterparts (Fig. 3d and S8†). Specifically, ternary systems with D/A ratios of 1.2:1.2, 1.5:1.2 and 1.7:1.2 have a higher COS of 5.1 ± 0.3%, 8.4 ± 0.4% and 8.9 ± 0.7% than their binary counterparts of 2.9%, 4.4% and 6.3%. We speculate that this may be related to the morphological difference between binary and ternary systems, which we will discuss specifically in the following section. As shown in Fig. 3e, the highest reported PCE value of OSCs in the literature with the COS value of active layers measured above 5% is 16.7% until now, which was reported by Kim and coworkers in ref. 31. In contrast, the highest efficiency of the PTQ10:D18:m-BTP-PhC6 system with a D/A ratio of 1:0.5:1.2 is 17.3%, together with a COS of 8.8%. It should be noticed that we have achieved the highest efficiency in OSCs with COS over 5%, illustrating that diluting the small molecule content is an effective method to fabricate high-efficiency and mechanically deformable OSCs.

Figuring out the role of D18 on morphology is of crucial importance to understand the divergent dependence of binary and ternary systems on the D/A ratio. Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was carried out to probe the molecular packing and crystallinity, which can be expressed by calculating the d-spacing and coherence length (CL), of the photoactive films.50 As shown in Fig. S9 and S10,† neat m-BTP-PhC6 and D18 show characteristic peaks at 0.42 (d-spacing of 1.49 nm) and 0.54 Å−1 (d-spacing of 1.16 nm) along the in plane direction, respectively. The characteristic crystalline peak of m-BTP-PhC6 can be clearly differentiated in PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 with a D/A ratio of 1:1.2 (CL of 7.20 nm and d-spacing of 1.48 nm in Table 2). However, this peak becomes much weaker when the D/A ratio increased and almost disappears in the 1.7:1.2 binary film (Fig. S10†), indicating the strong inhibition of m-BTP-PhC6 crystallization because of the interaction of PTQ10. The largely decreased crystallinity of m-BTP-PhC6 in binary PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 films when the D/A ratio increased results in the significant deterioration of electron mobility and thus a remarkable drop in photovoltaic performance. Moreover, this inhibition effect can also be confirmed by the significant decrease in absorption of m-BTP-PhC6 as shown in Fig. S11.† In contrast, the crystallinity of m-BTP-PhC6 is not severely changed after incorporating 50% D18, which exhibits comparable CL (7.13 nm) and d-spacing (1.49 nm) values compared to its binary counterpart (Table 2). This unchanged crystallinity of m-BTP-PhC6 indicates the poor interaction between D18 and m-BTP-PhC6. Moreover, we calculated the (100) peak location along the in plane direction of PTQ10:D18 films with various D18 contents to portray the interaction between PTQ10 and D18 (Fig. 4d). The (100) peak of pure PTQ10 and D18 along the in plane direction is located at 0.267 and 0.292 Å−1, respectively. The (100) peak location of binary PTQ10:D18 blends is located between 0.267 and 0.292 Å−1 following a linear function of the D18 content (Fig. 4d), which indicates the weak interaction between PTQ10 and D18. Therefore, the well maintained crystallinity of m-BTP-PhC6 in ternary PTQ10:D18:m-BTP-PhC6 as the D/A ratio increased enabled by the poor interaction between D18 and m-BTP-PhC6 ensures superior electron transportation and thus higher device efficiency.

Miscibility is another effective method to evaluate the interaction between different materials.51 Herein, contact angle measurement was employed to analyze the miscibility between D18, PTQ10 and m-BTP-PhC6. The corresponding images of water and glycerol droplets on the neat D18, PTQ10 and m-BTP-PhC6 films are shown in Fig. S12† and the calculated surface free energy (γs) is 34.09, 26.97 and 45.42 mN m−1, respectively (Table S2†). Correspondingly, the solubility parameters (δ), which are proportional to the square root of surface energy, are calculated to be 21.42, 19.05 and 45.42 MPa1/2, respectively. According to the Flory–Huggins model,52,53 the calculated interaction parameters between D18 and PTQ10 is 0.522 and that between D18 and m-BTP-PhC6 is 0.694. The high and similar interaction parameters between D18 and the other two materials indicate that D18 shows weak interaction with PTQ10 or m-BTP-PhC6. The results from contact angle measurements can well support the observation obtained from GIWAXS measurement.
Resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy were performed to detect the phase separation in these films. We choose an X-ray energy of 284.8 eV to ensure the highest scattering contrast of these organic materials.54Fig. 4e and S13† show the normalized RSoXS profiles of PTQ10:D18:m-BTP-PhC6 with various D/A ratios and the calculated domain sizes are listed in Table 3 and S3.† In binary PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 films, the domain size varies from 54.5 nm to 40.4, 24.4 and 21.6 nm when the D/A ratio increases from 1:1.2 to 1.2:1.2, 1.5:1.2 and 1.7:1.2, respectively. The stronger inhibition of PTQ10 to m-BTP-PhC6 at a larger D/A ratio makes it difficult for m-BTP-PhC6 to form a m-BTP-PhC6-rich region, resulting in a smaller domain size in the binary PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 system.55 Ternary blends with 1.2:1.2, 1.5:1.2 and 1.7:1.2 exhibit a similar domain size to their binary counterparts, which is 35.6, 22.9 and 20.9 nm, respectively. The TEM images shown in Fig. S14† indicate that all the binary PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 films exhibit homogeneous phase distribution and become more homogeneous as the D/A ratio increased. In contrast, the ternary systems display much more obvious phase separation in comparison with their binary counterparts due to the inferior miscibility between D18 and the two host materials. A similar domain size combined with more obvious phase separation provide the ternary films with a reduced interfacial area compared to their binary counterparts with the same D/A ratio, leading to the higher stretchability of ternary blends than the corresponding binary ones. Because of the strong tendency of D18 to crystallize and the poor interaction between D18 and m-BTP-PhC6, an obvious fiber-like structure induced by D18 can be observed in the binary D18:m-BTP-PhC6 film, which is favorable for charge transport.56,57 Ternary films retain the fibril structure of D18 and this structure becomes more apparent with the increased addition of D18, which is beneficial for charge transport at a high D/A ratio. Moreover, this clear fibril morphology of D18 also helps to prove the poor miscibility between D18 and the PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 matrix. The surface morphology evolution of these blend films is determined by the AFM test. As shown in Fig. S15,† the surface roughness of binary PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 systems decreases with a higher D/A ratio from 1.36 nm of 1:1.2 to 0.697 nm of 1.7:1.2, correlating well with the smaller phase separation in blends with a larger D/A ratio observed in RSoXS.49 This D/A ratio dependent relationship also occurs in ternary PTQ10:D18:m-BTP-PhC6 systems.

In order to illuminate the role of D18 in enhancing the D/A ratio tolerance in ternary blends, we performed in situ studies on morphology evolutions during film drying. Fig. 5a–d and S16† show the time evolution of UV-vis absorption contour maps of PTQ10:D18:m-BTP-PhC6 with different relative ratios. The corresponding raw in situ UV-vis absorption spectra are shown in Fig. S17.† The UV-vis absorption spectra are transformed from the transmission spectra based on the equation Aλ = −log10(T), where Aλ is the absorbance at a certain wavelength (λ) and T is the measured transmittance after background correction using blank glass.58 The evolution of the peak location in UV-vis absorption reveals the change of aggregation of the donor or acceptor. In all the binary PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 films, both the peak location of PTQ10 and m-BTP-PhC6 are red-shifted when solvent evaporated, suggesting that simultaneous aggregation of PTQ10 and m-BTP-PhC6 occurred. However, no obvious red-shift of D18 can be observed in D18:m-BTP-PhC6 during solvent evaporation. Incorporating D18 into PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 stabilizes the aggregation of PTQ10 as revealed by the nearly identical peak location of PTQ10 across the whole film-drying process in all three ternary films.
 Fig. 5  (a)–(d) Time-dependent contour maps of UV-vis absorption spectra, (e)–(h) time evolution of the peak location of m-BTP-PhC6 and (i)–(l) diagram of morphology of PTQ10:D18:m-BTP-PhC6 with ratios of 1:0:1.2, 1.5:0:1.2, 1:0.5:1.2 and 0:1:1.2. 
The time evolution of the m-BTP-PhC6 peak location in these films is extracted from the in situ UV-vis absorption spectrum to directly understand the influence of PTQ10 and D18 on the aggregation behavior of m-BTP-PhC6 and the relative results are shown in Fig. 5e–h and S18.† The peak location evolution of these films can be divided into three stages. For the first stage, the peak location of m-BTP-PhC6 does not vary with solvent evaporation. In the second stage, the absorption peak location of m-BTP-PhC6 shifts to the NIR region as the solvent evaporates since the solution concentration crosses the solubility limit and reaches critical supersaturation. Finally, the peak location of m-BTP-PhC6 reaches a constant at the third stage. For binary PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 systems, the duration of the second stage is prolonged as the D/A ratio increases, significantly varying from 1.2 s for 1:1.2 to 2.04 s for 1.5:1.2. The larger number of PTQ10 molecules in binary PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 systems confines the movement of m-BTP-PhC6. Therefore, m-BTP-PhC6 molecules need to take a longer time to first come out from the donor region and then to form aggregates. As a result of the stronger confinement of PTQ10 to m-BTP-PhC6 at a higher D/A ratio, m-BTP-PhC6 cannot form a sufficient self-aggregation region to maintain the continuous interpenetrating network, which is harmful for electron mobility and photovoltaic performance. Because of the poor interaction between D18 and m-BTP-PhC6, the D18:m-BTP-PhC6 binary film exhibits the shortest time of 0.88 s of the second stage. Adding 50% D18 into PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 to construct a ternary blend with a D/A ratio of 1.5:1.2 shortens the duration time of the second stage to 1.24 s, which is comparable with that of binary PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 with a D/A ratio of 1:1.2. The easy aggregation of m-BTP-PhC6 in ternary blends ensures the efficient crystallization of m-BTP-PhC6 and the formation of an interconnected interpenetrating network at a large D/A ratio, resulting in a much higher PCE than binary PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6.
With the help of multiple morphology characterization measurements, the morphology of PTQ10:D18:m-BTP-PhC6 with ratios of 1:0:1.2, 1.5:0:1.2, 1:0.5:1.2 and 0:1:1.2 can be depicted as shown by the pictures in Fig. 5i–l. For PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 with a D/A ratio of 1:1.2, m-BTP-PhC6 can easily form a large aggregated region of m-BTP-PhC6 with relatively higher crystallinity due to the low content of PTQ10, resulting in a large domain size. When the D/A ratio increases to 1.5:1.2, it is difficult for the uniformly dispersed m-BTP-PhC6 molecules in the PTQ10 matrix to aggregate and crystallize because of the strong inhibition of PTQ10, leading to a homogeneously distributed domain with lower crystallinity and a small domain size. This insufficient aggregation of m-BTP-PhC6 breaks the continuity of the interpenetrating network and thus decreases the photovoltaic performance. Nevertheless, the smaller volume of m-BTP-PhC6 benefits the mechanical ductility of binary PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 with a D/A ratio of 1.5:1.2. For ternary blends with an addition of 50% D18, the poor miscibility between D18 and m-BTP-PhC6 promises the effective aggregation and crystallinity of m-BTP-PhC6. The large number of aggregated m-BTP-PhC6 molecules not only contribute to efficient charge transport but also enable ternary blends with a smaller interface and thus higher stretchability than their binary counterparts.49 The highest crystallinity of m-BTP-PhC6 with the largest aggregated region was achieved in the binary D18:m-BTP-PhC6 blend film, together with the strong crystallinity of D18 resulting in its poorest mechanical performance.
Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a series of high-efficiency and mechanically robust OSCs by incorporating a relatively immiscible polymer donor (D18) into the PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 system to dilute the content of brittle small molecules (m-BTP-PhC6). It was found that directly increasing the content of PTQ10 in binary PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 blends indeed increased the deformability of photovoltaic films as a result of the reduction of debonding sites along the brittle interface. However, the photon-to -electron conversion efficiency also significantly decreased due to the largely restricted crystallinity of m-BTP-PhC6 by PTQ10. Replacing PTQ10 with D18 not only can effectively boost the photovoltaic performance but also benefit the mechanical stretchability, resulting in a balanced high efficiency of 17.3% and superior deformability of 8.8%. Augmented PCE at a large D/A ratio in ternary blends stems from the largely improved crystallinity of m-BTP-PhC6 and thus well maintained percolation pathways, as a result of poor interaction between D18 and m-BTP-PhC6. More importantly, the larger aggregated region of m-BTP-PhC6 enables the ternary systems with less interfacial area as compared to their binary counterparts. Our work clearly demonstrates that highly efficient polymer:small molecule OSCs with superior mechanical reliability can be achieved through diluting the content of small molecules with proper control over molecular interaction.
