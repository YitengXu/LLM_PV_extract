    , Accepted 22nd February 2021First published on 23rd February 2021AbstractA waste heat recovery unit can transfer heat at high temperatures to another energy form for specific purposes with increasing energy efficiency. The heat recovered from nature or human body systems for generating electricity or powering wearable devices is a good example of green and sustainable power sources. Currently available thermoelectric generators (TEGs) can convert heat into electricity. However, they lack mechanical flexibility and specially designed structures to efficiently harvest energy from low temperature (≤100 °C) surfaces, e.g., hot water pipes, car roofs, or human skin. Here, we report bottom-up manufacturing that scaled up molecular-level polymer-nanoparticle hybridization to device-level units, thus bridging nanoscale material interactions to macroscale energy conversion efficiency. In situ polymerization optimized the interface between polyaniline (PANi) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) to reach a higher power factor (i.e., ∼1.25 μW m−1 K−2) than the directly mixed PANi/MWNT samples (i.e., ∼0.8 μW m−1 K−2), both with a high nanotube concentration of 58.7 wt%. With a rapidly prototyped thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) substrate, the PANi/MWNT hybrids formed a bio-inspired, gill-mimicking, and flexible thermoelectric generator (fTEG). These out-of-plane structures with PANi/MWNTs as gills showed highly efficient energy transformation on the surfaces of hot water containers (∼100 °C), car roofs (∼38 °C), and human skin (∼37 °C). The PANi/MWNT fTEG showed excellent mechanical durability with improved stiffness and strength than pure PANi, fatigue resistance, and bendability most appropriate for powering wearable sensors. With a strain switch, the fTEG is able to power a sensing system that reveals biosignals, such as joint movement and respiration, in the long term. The self-powered sensing system applies to wearable smart devices and demonstrates the potential for using the thermoelectric effect as an alternative power source.
1. Introduction
Even with high energy density, batteries still suffer from limited capacity, regular charging, high maintenance in extreme environments, and expensive replacement.1–3 It is estimated that the amount of power battery waste in China will reach 34.7 kilotons in 2020,4 causing a considerable challenge for battery reuse and recycling. Other electrical energy providers, such as photovoltaic cells or wind turbines, rely heavily on solar radiation and wind speeds making their utilization challenging in remote areas.5,6 In contrast, thermoelectric generators (TEGs) can leverage temperature differences and directly convert heat into electricity through the Seebeck effect.7 TEGs do not necessarily contain a complex assembly and can be used in static or extreme environments (e.g., outer space or deep sea) with high reliability.8 The application of radioisotope TEGs in the Apollo mission has proven their stability and long service-free lifetime.9 With improved efficiency or power output, TEGs can be compatible with existing technologies and suitable to recover waste energy and serve as green and sustainable power sources.10,11
Traditionally, Bi-Te, Pb-Te, and Si-Ge-based semiconductors are frequently used in TEGs,12 such as those for commercially available modules, automotive components, and space probes. Yet, synthesizing these compounds from their elementary substances usually requires high-temperature sintering for hours and the use of expensive rare elements,13–15 which requires more investment before energy output. Therefore, organic-based thermoelectric materials are known for their light weight, low toxicity, geometry versatility, processing scalability, and cost efficiency.16 This material category includes the most studied conjugated polymers, such as poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT),17 poly(3,4 ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT),18 polyaniline (PANi),19 and polypyrrole (PPy).18 Among them, PANi is unique due to its easy synthesis, environmental stability, and broad applications.20–24 Especially, its starting material for synthesis, aniline, can be extracted as a by-product from oil and coal tar refining,25 making PANi affordable in mass production. Given the conjugated structures of conductive polymers, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can form π–π interactions and synergistic effects in PANi composites.26–29
It is easy for thermoelectric (TE) devices to produce electricity with a thermal gradient along the in-plane direction, especially for fibers and films.30–32 Nevertheless, converting waste heat from complex geometries or morphing shapes into electricity from a hot surface can be challenging. For example, for close contact with human skin, TE materials need to maintain high reliability, low weight, and reduced dimensions.33 As a result, in thermoelectric systems, the temperature variation perpendicular to the skin direction may not be large enough for high energy output or efficiency. Besides, the compliance and wrinkles of human skin may cause fatigue or bonding failure of TEGs with high stiffness. Flexible TE devices have been reported in coiled,34 chevron,35 bracelet,36 and other complex 3D structures37–39 to achieve efficient heat recovery and mechanical durability. However, these 3D morphologies require time-consuming processing and multi-step treatment.40,41 A gill-mimicking structured thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) substrate was therefore developed and one-step processed with fused filament fabrication. The customized shape is integrated with thermoelectric materials without detachment during bending. These flexible TEGs provide high compatibility for self-powered biosensing systems to detect and prevent diseases.42–44 The body temperature stability also allows continuous and constant capture of human physical data.
This research examined the nanoscale interactions between PANi and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) in in situ polymerization and direct mixing. The in situ polymerized PANi/58.7 wt% MWNTs showed the highest electrical conductivity, thermoelectric power factor, and mechanical robustness due to the PANi hybridization on MWNT surfaces. Thus, these composites were assembled with a flexible TPU substrate mimicking fish gills. Fish exchange gases of oxygen and carbon dioxide via these gill structures, inspiring our design of a flexible TEG (fTEG) that exhibits high reliability in collecting waste heat from the surfaces of a hot water container, car roof, and human skin. The integration of the fTEG with our customized, health-monitoring sensor also demonstrated a self-powering sensing system that can detect biosignals for human health monitoring, e.g., finger bending and aspiration patterns. As compared to intermediate-(450–850 K) and high-temperature (850–1300 K) thermoelectric materials, our fTEG unit for collecting low-temperature heat (<450 K) is also applicable to biomedical, robotics, sensors, actuators, and other wearable electronics.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Aniline (ACS reagent, ≥99.5%), ammonium persulfate (APS) (ACS reagent, ≥98.0%), methanol (HPLC, ≥99.9%), and hydrochloric acid (ACS reagent, 37%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Industrial-grade, commercial multi-walled carbon nanotubes (NC7000, Nanocyl, Belgium; carbon purity 90%, surface area 250–300 m2 g−1 and intrinsic volume conductivity 104 S cm−1), with an average diameter of 9.5 nm and length of 1.5 μm, were used as received. Thermoplastic polyurethane (Elastollan® soft 35 A) was kindly provided by BASF.
2.2 
          In situ polymerization of PANi/MWNTs
0.4 g MWNTs were added to 35 mL 1 M hydrochloric acid and sonicated with a tip sonicator (Model 120, Fisher brand) for 1 hour. Aniline was added to the solution afterward. APS was dissolved in 15 mL 1 M hydrochloric acid. Both solutions were precooled in an ice bath before the polymerization. The APS solution was then slowly added into the aniline solution in 0.5 h. The reaction took 6 h under a temperature of 0 °C and continuous stirring, during which the sonication continued. The synthesized PANi/MWNTs were collected with suction filtration and washed with deionized water and methanol until the filtrate was colorless. The collected solid was vacuum dried under 60 °C overnight. The MWNT weight percentage was calculated as the ratio between the mass of initially added MWNTs and the total product mass. The thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) confirmed the weight percentage, with an example shown in Fig. S1.† The MWNT weight percentage was controlled with the amount of aniline. The amount of APS was changed accordingly to maintain a molecular ratio of 5:6 between aniline and APS. Pure PANi was synthesized with the same method without adding MWNTs. The PANi/MWNT bulk materials were pressed under 10 MPa with a 10 mm × 10 mm × 1 mm pellet die.
2.3 Direct mixing of PANi/MWNTs
Pure PANi was synthesized using the above-mentioned method. Varied weights of MWNTs and PANi were added to deionized water. Tip sonication and stirring were applied for 1 h to reach homogeneity with different weight ratios. The mixed powder was collected with suction filtration and washed with deionized water and methanol. To compare the reinforcement efficiency, PANi composites containing different MWNT loadings (i.e., PANi/11.7 wt% MWNTs, PANi/23.7 wt% MWNTs, PANi/28.2 wt% MWNTs, PANi/35.6 wt% MWNTs, PANi/43.9 wt% MWNTs, PANi/58.7 wt% MWNTs, and PANi/72.1 wt% MWNTs) were used in both in situ polymerization and direct mixing.
2.4 Fabrication of customized fTEGs and wearable sensors
Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) (H-Series Benchtop 5-axis printer from Diabase Engineering) was used to print the gill structures for fTEGs. A thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) filament with a diameter of 1.75 mm was used for printing the substrate due to its stretchability and compliance to the surfaces of complex geometries. The nozzle (diameter of 0.4 mm) temperature was set to 220 °C during the printing, with a printing speed of 6 cm s−1. The STL file of the printed parts was generated with OpenSCAD. The PANi/MWNT bulks were manually inserted into the openings at the bottom of the printed substrate (Fig. S2†). Kapton® tape was applied as the binder to fix the bulks to the substrate gills (the thermogravimetric analysis of the tape till 100 °C shown in Fig. S3† showed high thermal stability). Copper wires and carbon tape were used to connect the thermoelectric bulks in series. To demonstrate the self-powering in detecting biosignals, a customized sensor with a copper wire embedded in the TPU matrix was connected to the TEG to monitor finger bending and sensitive chest expansion with aspiration. Informed consent was obtained for the human participant in the experiments.
2.5 Characterization
A scanning electron microscope (SEM) (XL30 ESEM, Phillips) was used for microstructural morphology analysis. Electrical conductivity was measured via a four-point probe van der Pauw method with a digital multimeter (DMM7510, Keithley).45 The Seebeck coefficient was measured with a homemade setup, where one edge of the thermoelectric bulk was heated with a hotplate (Isotemp), and two K-type thermocouples were glued with silver paste to the hot and cold sides of the bulk. Two copper wires were attached to the bulk next to the thermocouples to detect the local electrical potentials. The voltage between the two copper wires was measured with a digital multimeter (DMM7510, Keithley). The Seebeck coefficient was obtained with a linear fitting of multiple data points, exemplified in Fig. S4.† Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was conducted with a Bruker IFS66V/S equipped with a KBr splitter. Raman spectra were obtained with a 532 mm laser (alpha300 RA, WITec). Tensile tests were conducted using a Discovery HR-2 (TA instrument), with a strain rate of 3 μm s−1. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) of pure PANi and PANi/58.7 wt% MWNT composites was conducted between 25 °C and 350 °C with a heating rate of 3 °C min, with 0.1% axial displacement. The fatigue tests on the prepared fTEGs used controlled bending radii and a bending cycle of 1000, with each cycle for 3.9 s. The holder's moving speed was set to 6.2 mm s−1 on a tested device of 6 cm in length.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and processing of composites

Fig. 1 describes the in situ polymerization and direct mixing for preparing PANi/MWNT composites. During the in situ polymerization, aniline and MWNTs were mixed before initiating the polymer synthesis (Fig. 1a1). Precise control of the nanoscale interfaces during this procedure can significantly enhance composite properties (Fig. 1a2). The strong attraction between the conjugated structure of polyaniline and the surface of the carbon nanotubes through π–π stacking makes MWNTs a soft template to facilitate the local attachment and possible alignment of polyaniline molecules during the in situ polymerization.46 The as-synthesized powders confirmed the coated PANi on MWNTs (Fig. 1a3), showing a homogeneous nanotube size distribution with an average diameter of about 28 nm (Fig. 1a3) compared to an average diameter of 9.5 nm for the as-obtained MWNTs. The intertwined network consisted of flexible MWNTs coated with rigid PANi showing nano-cracks on the surface. A lack of compliance of the PANi backbone often causes a cracked morphology.47 The mechanically blended PANi and MWNTs, however, displayed phase-separated regions (Fig. 1b1–b2). The coexistence of aggregated MWNTs and granular PAN particles resulted in a heterogeneous morphology (Fig. 1b3). Fig. 1c and d show the chemical reaction of the oxidative polymerization of PANi (Fig. 1c), the assembly path of the fTEG (Fig. 1d1 to 1d4), and the use of these composites in 3D printed fTEGs for self-powering biosensors (Fig. 1d4).

3.2 Chemical structure of the composites
The FTIR spectra in Fig. 2a confirmed the polymerization of PANi, including the functional groups in the PANi composites. The peak at 1624 cm−1 corresponded to the carbon/carbon double bonds of quinoid rings, while the peak at 1522 cm−1 is attributed to carbon/carbon single bond stretching and C–H bending within benzenoid rings.48,49 The characteristic bands appearing at 1193 cm−1 are related to the delocalization of electrons as evidence of PANi conductivity.46,49 The peaks at 1352 cm−1, 1256 cm−1, and 832 cm−1 are assigned to C–N stretching, C–H in-plane bending, and out-of-plane C–H deformation, respectively.50,51 The weak C–N stretching specifically in quinoid–benzenoid–quinoid units induces a small peak at 1452 cm−1 that is imperceptible at high MWNT concentrations.50 Regarding MWNTs, although it is reported that the stretching of the carbon skeleton will show a peak near 1550 cm−1,52,53 the signal was too weak to perceive, as has been previously reported.54–56 The position of the characteristic peaks for PANi, therefore, remained unchanged for the PANi/MWNT composites.

The Raman spectra of a series of PANi/MWNTs showed the PANi structure and indicated the universal coating composition of the composites. For the spectrum of pure PANi, as shown in Fig. 2b, the peak at 1166 cm−1 is attributed to the C–H bending vibration of the quinoid ring and benzenoid ring, which was depressed with a higher loading of MWNTs.57 The peak at 1329 cm−1 represents the C–N+ vibration of the quinoid ring.58 The peaks located at 1485 cm−1 and 1589 cm−1 were attributed to the CN stretching of the quinoid di-imine units and C–C stretching of the benzenoid rings, respectively.59,60 Clear peaks situated at 1589 cm−1 and 1341 cm−1 in the pure MWNT spectrum reflect the G-band derived from the graphite-like mode and the disorder-induced D-band, respectively.54 Apart from the spectrum of the pure MWNTs, the peaks of the composites with different weight ratios were dominated by the signal of PANi. These PANi peaks suggested the uniform coating of the PANi shell on the MWNT core since the beam reached the polymer before the MWNTs (i.e., PANi coating) and the Raman mapped random regions in the composites (i.e., coating homogeneity). The FTIR and Raman spectra of the directly mixed composites are shown in Fig. S5.† The characteristic peaks were located at the same positions and suggested the coexistence of PANi and MWNTs. However, the spectral intensity of the composites did not show consistent variation trends within the in situ polymerized composites (Fig. S5b†vs.2b). The lack of order in peak intensity for both Raman and FTIR suggested the random distribution of PANi and aggregated MWNTs (Fig. 1b3).
3.3 TEG performance as a function of MWNT loading
PANi/MWNT pellets with a ∼10 mm × 10 mm × 1 mm size were prepared by cold pressing. With different MWNT loadings and fabrication procedures, PANi displayed varying thermoelectric effects. Fig. 3a shows the trend of electrical conductivity as a function of MWNT concentrations. The inclusion of MWNTs increased the electrical conductivity of both directly mixed and in situ polymerized PANi. The pure PANi showed a conductivity of 6.4 S cm−1. The inclusion of 28.2 wt% MWNTs significantly improved the conductivity to ∼20 S cm−1 for the composites from both direct mixing and in situ polymerization, with this concentration defining the percolation threshold (i.e., 28.2 wt%). The highest conductivity for the directly mixed PANi/MWNTs was 22.7 S cm; as a comparison, the in situ polymerized PANi/MWNTs showed the best conductivity of 66.2 S cm−1. As compared to the composites from the direct mixing that had plateau regions beyond the percolation (Fig. 3a), in situ polymerization proved to be a more efficient way to enhance electron transport. The better properties of the in situ polymerized PANi/MWNT samples were due to the even distribution of MWNTs, more interactive interfaces when PANi formed uniform coatings on MWNTs (Fig. 1a3 and 1b3), and a closely packed microstructure. For example, a simple measurement of the composite density showed a value of 1.17 g cm−3 for in situ polymerized PANi/58.7 wt% MWNTs (a theoretical prediction of 1.61 g cm−3), while that of the directly mixed sample was 0.58 g cm−3 with the same MWNT loading. The density difference can be observed in the samples of different MWNTs' contents (Fig. 3b). The inclusion of highly loaded MWNTs would cause a large deviation of the composite density from the theoretical value because of the voids between adjacent MWNTs. The in situ polymerized PANi/MWNTs processed relatively higher densities owing to the uniform coating of PANi that decreased the voids, whereas under the same pressure in the directly mixed composites, it was more challenging for the larger PANi clusters to fill in the intervals between MWNTs, leaving more voids that caused lowered properties (Fig. 3a).
 Fig. 3  (a) Electrical conductivity, (b) bulk density after the cold pressing, (c) Seebeck coefficient, and (d) power factor vs. MWNT concentrations (wt%) for in situ polymerized and directly mixed PANi/MWNTs. The standard deviations in (a) were small due to the consistency of measured conductivity. 
A rough estimation of the reinforcement efficiency in in situ polymerized composites showed an intrinsic conductivity of MWNTs of 117 S cm−1 (i.e., a math fitting between 23.7 wt% and 58.7 wt% in situ polymerized PANi/MWNT composites). Note that these conductivity values are much smaller than the electrical conductivity in pure CNTs or high-quality graphene, with the intrinsic conductivity reaching ∼104 S cm−1 for single nanotubes or nanolayers.61–63 However, the cold-pressed MWNT powder resulted in complex structures containing voids, nanotube entanglements, bending of bundles, and buckling of long tubes, which led to a poor contact between nanotubes and electron scattering, inevitably decreasing electrical conductivity. Thus, the compressed pellets containing 100% MWNTs in this study showed a conductivity of only 24.7 S cm−1 (Fig. 3a), and many other reported PANi/CNT composites under mechanical blending showed a similar conductivity.64–66 This is due to the high porosity of the MWNTs (Fig. 3b).
The measure of the magnitude of electron flow in response to a temperature difference across a material is given by the Seebeck coefficient (S), with higher values corresponding to better heat-electricity energy conversion efficiency. All composites have higher Seebeck coefficient values than pure PANi or MWNTs (Fig. 3c). Compared with pure PANi with randomly conglomerated polymer chains (e.g., 0%), the fibrillar nanotubes of one-dimensional morphology have a higher density of states at the Fermi level induced by nanoscale confinement, and this endows them with better thermoelectric properties (e.g., 100% in Fig. 3c).67 However, the lack of an effectively conductive network in a pure MWNT sample, reflected in the poor electrical conductivity (Fig. 3a), limited its thermopower despite its 1D character.68 The directly mixed PANi/MWNTs showed a similar trend but higher Seebeck coefficients than in situ PANi/MWNTs (Fig. 3c and S6). This may be due to a couple of reasons. First, the exposed MWNTs, without the attachment of PANi, had better quantum confinement due to their smaller size.69 Second, more interfaces and a lack of close packing between PANi and MWNT phases may act as a barrier to electron carriers and filter low-energy carriers.70–72 This filtering effect was more distinct in the directly mixed composites and only higher-energy carriers were retained as compared to the in situ polymerized samples. This would lead to lower carrier concentrations in the directly mixed samples. As the Seebeck coefficient is inversely proportional to the carrier concentration, to the two thirds power, for degenerate semiconductors,73 the directly mixed samples showed increased Seebeck coefficient values.
Related to the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient, the thermoelectric power factor for the thermoelectric materials is given in Fig. 3d, according to eqn (1). Power factor = σS2(1)
Here σ is the electrical conductivity, and a higher power factor means more generated energy from the same temperature difference. Among all samples, in situ polymerized PANi/58.7 wt% MWNTs showed the highest power factor (i.e., ∼1.25 μW m−1 K−2) and thus was used as the optimized composition.
3.4 Mechanical robustness

Fig. 4a shows the tensile strength for in situ polymerized and directly mixed samples. For the samples with 0–23.7 wt% MWNTs, the tensile strengths were similar between these two processing strategies (i.e., in situ polymerization vs. direct mixing), with the composites showing a negligible increase compared to pure PANi. When the MWNT content was more than 28.2 wt%, the in situ polymerized samples showed evidently higher strength than the directly mixed composites. The higher loading of MWNTs increased the strength for the in situ polymerized PANi, and the strongest composite was PANi/58.7 wt% MWNTs. In contrast, directly mixed PANi/MWNTs did not show much enhancement in tensile strength. Especially for the composites with more than 28.2 wt% MWNTs, the strength remained similar to the value of MWNTs, implying nanotube aggregation and phase separation (Fig. 1b3).
 Fig. 4  (a) Ultimate tensile strength and (b) Young's modulus values as a function of MWNT concentrations for in situ polymerized and directly mixed PANi/MWNTs. (c) Storage moduli and (d) tanδ of pure PANi, directly mixed PANi/58.7 wt% MWNTs, and in situ polymerized PANi/58.7 wt% MWNTs. The values of the ultimate tensile strength, Young's modulus and tensile strain values are listed in Table S1.† 
A similar phenomenon can be observed in the modulus trend (Fig. 4b). The in situ polymerized samples possessed much higher Young's moduli than the directly mixed composites, especially when the MWNT concentration exceeded the mechanical percolation threshold (i.e., 23.7 wt%). This trend was roughly consistent with the electrical conductivity measurements, suggesting the uniform distribution of MWNTs and their efficient interfacial interactions with PANi (Fig. 3a). The mechanical enhancement in the in situ polymerized composites was closely related to the MWNT dispersions, PANi phase uniformity, and effective interfacial interactions. In contrast, the decrease of composite mechanics in the directly mixed PANi/MWNTs from PANi was because of the voids (Fig. 3b), MWNT aggregates, and phase separation between PANi and MWNTs (Fig. 1b3).
The dynamic mechanical analysis data in Fig. 4c and d show the storage modulus (E′) and the dampening parameter (tanδ). Pure PANi showed a transition at ∼30 °C, related to the β relaxation from the motion of the hydrogen-bonded solvent molecules (i.e., water residue during synthesis and washing).74 The second transition in PANi was at ∼270 °C, representing the α transition (i.e., glass transition) of the crosslinked material,74,75 and possibly crosslinking76 or degradation.77 The in situ polymerized PANi/58.7 wt% MWNTs showed enhanced stiffness (E′ in Fig. 4c) and thermal stability (tanδ in Fig. 4d), benefiting the mechanical durability of TEGs when subjected to cycled thermal stress during heating or cooling. The less dramatic transition starting at ∼270 °C in in situ polymerized PANi/58.7 wt% MWNTs than for the pure PANi also revealed that the π–π interaction slowed down the PANi decomposition. Not surprisingly, the directly mixed PANi/58.7 wt% MWNTs showed a much lower storage modulus and plateau phenomenon due to its similar microstructure to pure MWNTs when its MWNT concentration was too high to reflect the polymer transitions or compliance. This outcome agrees with the tensile test, where the poor contact between the PANi phase and the MWNT phase weakened the composites (Fig. 4a and b).
3.5 Fatigue resistance and temperature variation on substrate surfaces
We chose the in situ polymerized PANi/58.7 wt% MWNTs with its comparatively higher power factor and composite mechanics to assemble fTEGs. The gill-mimicking structure contained the PANi/58.7 wt% MWNT composites on a substrate of TPU, with each gill having dimensions of 10 mm × 10 mm × 1 mm. A dynamic fatigue test was conducted with tensile testing holders to verify the structural stability of the fTEG. Considering an average curvature radius of a human forearm,14 we set the maximum bending radius as 2 cm during the dynamic fatigue tests to ensure its wearable viability on human arms. Fig. 5a1 shows the internal resistance of the fTEG as a function of bending cycles. This gill's resistance increased from 13 Ω to several hundred Ohms (i.e., 200–400 Ω) during bending and dropped back to 13 Ω at the end of each fatigue cycle. Fig. 5a2 shows the fast response between cycles (<0.25 s), and Fig. 5a3 shows the total internal resistance of the device settling at 13 Ω with a 100% recovery after 1000 cycles, proving the structural integrity when mimicking repetitive arm movement. The inset figure in Fig. 5a2, zoomed in on the 15th and 16th cycles, shows the splitting peaks corresponding to the bending and the stretching stages. These split peaks indicate the moving of the structure, which was mainly affected by electrical contact. Many novel fTEGs have an internal resistance range from 200–300 Ω.37,78–80 Compared to those fTEGs, our gilled morphology has more flexibility in resistivity control and is highly customizable via 3D printing to allow for a more complex structural design.

To illustrate the gill-mimicking structure's general robustness, bending tests as a function of bending radius (Fig. 5b) and temperature (Fig. 5c) were conducted. The tensile testing holders were set with different gauge lengths for a series of bending radii (i.e., from ∼2.0 cm to ∼2.8 cm), and the resistance was recorded at the end of each bending. Fig. 5b shows the consistent resistance of the fTEG, well confined between 10 and 13 Ω, from an original non-bending state to the bending state with a radius between 2.0 cm and 2.7 cm. The resistance increased abruptly to ∼20 Ω with a radius of 2.8 cm. However, these resistance values between 10 Ω and 20 Ω were much smaller than the maxima during gill movement (i.e., 200–400 Ω, as shown in Fig. 5a1), suggesting the gill structure's high sensitivity to the device wearers' motion, instead of the fTEG's bending. In addition, the consistent low resistance at the beginning and end of the bending (i.e., 10 Ω to 20 Ω) suggested that the fluctuation of the resistance during the dynamic bending test (i.e., 200–400 Ω) was mainly caused by the dynamic gill vibration instead of the substrate strain. The resistance independence on the substrate bending also explained the fast recovery at the end of every cycle. As we aim at low-temperature surfaces (i.e., here in this study ≤100 °C), the fTEG was fixed to a beaker surface with a radius of 2.5 cm and put in a furnace with controlled temperatures (i.e., a range between 20 °C and 100 °C with a step of 10 °C). Structural stability within this temperature range was high, as shown in Fig. 5c. The resistance stayed within a narrow range of 12–18 Ω, confirming its usability at higher temperatures. The negligible resistance change was reversible when the temperature decreased.
The finite element analysis (FEA) method, carried out with ANSYS, simulated the temperature changes along with gill-plane directions. One example was the attachment of the fTEG on human skin, with a substrate temperature of 37 °C (Fig. 5e). The air-free convection was set to 1 W (m2 K−1), which corresponds to the heat transfer between a still body and the 20 °C, 1 atm standard atmosphere.81 The thermal conductivity of thermoelectric PANi/MWNTs and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) was considered to be 1.5 W (m−1 K−1) and 0.25 W (m−1 K−1), respectively.82 The temperature distribution profile in Fig. 5e1 showed a temperature difference of about 2.41 K along the gills, while the flat design could hardly yield a 0.1 K temperature drop across the plane in Fig. 5e2. This temperature difference is only a rough estimation to show the gill-inspired device's significant advantages (Fig. 5e1) over flat pieces (Fig. 5e2). A similar result can be seen in the temperature distribution comparison under the same thermal conditions on a curved surface as well (Fig. S7†). Fig. 5d shows a maximum temperature difference yielded from a series of hot side temperatures (i.e., the temperature distribution mapping contour is included in Fig. S8†). With the increase of the substrate (hot side) temperature, the gill-inspired structure showed a higher ability to obtain higher temperature differences. This distinct temperature difference induced by gill structures when attached to the human body demonstrated the potential to produce output power from skin temperature. In reality, moving sports persons can increase air convection, thus facilitating heat dissipation and a larger voltage generation.36 To simplify the experiments and minimize the systematic error, the following demonstration includes measuring TE effects on normal human skin without challenging exercise or extreme environmental conditions.
3.6 TEG unit demonstration for self-powered biosensors
A thermoelectric system can be integrated with existing platforms to boost energy efficiency and reduce environmental impact, e.g., collecting waste heat from a hot exhaust flue.83 We first applied the fTEG to different complex hot surfaces to examine their capability of generating a voltage. In Fig. 6a, the voltage generated with the surface temperature of the human forearm is approximately 0.14 mV. The room temperature was 20 °C without forced convection, and the human was in a static state. The voltage fluctuated between 0.10 mV and 0.16 mV during a 60 min test window. Unlike some designs under which the voltage descended perceptibly in the first two minutes,14,84 the voltage from our fTEG stabilized with slight fluctuations due to the complex heat transfer process from the body core to the generator. Given the five thermoelectric gills connected in series and the Seebeck coefficient of 14.5 μV K−1, the temperature difference between the hot-side substrates and cold-side sample-tip was calculated to be ∼1.93 K according to eqn (2). ΔV = nSΔT(2)
 Fig. 6  The voltage generated when the fTEG was attached to (a) a human forearm and (b) a hot water bottle, and (c) a car roof under the sun. The inset pictures are the photos of the test setup. (d) Voltage change as a function of finger bending, with the inset photos showing the finger gestures and circuit diagram. (e) Voltage variations as responses to the chest expansion during respiration, with the inset photos of the experimental setup and the zoomed-in figure showing voltage between 35 and 70 seconds. (f) The output voltage and output power of the fTEG as a function of different currents. The solid line represents the theoretical value, and the scattering points represent measured results. 
Here n is the number of TE bulks, S is the Seebeck coefficient, and ΔT and ΔV are the temperature difference and voltage difference between the hot and the cold sides, respectively. Compared to the simulated temperature drop of 2.41 K, the smaller difference might be because of the lower temperature of the exposed skin (<37 °C at an air temperature of 20 °C) and the imperfect thermal contact between the fTEG device and the skin.
We also recorded the generated voltage when the fTEG was attached to a hot water bottle with a bending radius of 43.2 mm. Two conditions were compared: (i) boiling water was cooled in air (i.e., 100 °C to 51.7 °C) and (ii) water constantly boiled on a hotplate (i.e., 100 °C). As shown in Fig. 6b, the voltage gradually decreased from 1.1 mV to 0.3 mV, with the water temperature cooling down from 100 °C to 51.7 °C within a time window of 80 min. In comparison, the continuously heated bottle showed a voltage fluctuation around ∼1.1 mV, consistent with the water temperature. The five broad peaks in Fig. 6b were caused by the hotplate's heating source that turned on and off alternatively to keep the temperature constant (i.e., 100 °C). This voltage variation due to small heating change also suggested the fTEG's potential to serve as a sensor for temporary temperature shifting.

Fig. 6c demonstrates the possibility of generating a voltage from a car roof that was exposed under the sun. The experiment was conducted with the outdoor air temperature being 32.8 °C (from 3 pm to 4 pm, Oct. 22nd, 2020, in Mesa, Arizona). Considering the Seebeck coefficient of 14.5 μV K−1 for each thermoelectric gill, the temperature difference between the car surface and the ambient air (measured to be 35.4 °C) was around 2.07 K, according to eqn (2). The natural wind (reported to vary from 1.34–2.68 m s−1) could cause forced convection on the cold side of the fTEG. As a result, the temperature difference experienced a slight increase when the air flowed faster, explaining the greater fluctuation of the generated voltage in the outdoor environment. The same fTEG on a heated metal substrate showed more stabilized voltage (Fig. 6c), with the five broad peaks reflecting the heating source variations.
To verify the fTEG's ability to power a sensor that detects biosignals, we connected a strain switch to the fTEG following the circuit diagram shown in the inset of Fig. 6d. In the finger bending test as shown in Fig. 6d, the fTEG was wrapped around the forearm to harvest body temperature, the same as the voltage test in Fig. 6a. Upon finger bending and stretching, the switch's copper wires will detach from and re-attach to each other due to the switch substrate's stretchability. Accordingly, the multimeter will record the open-circuit voltage and the voltage drop across one of the resistors (approximately half of the open-circuit voltage if the internal impedance is neglected) alternatively. The rectangular shape of the signal in Fig. 6d indicates a fast response to the finger movement, attributed to the voltage's immediate response in the circuit. Alternatively, we attached the strain switch to the chest close to the thoracic diaphragm. Upon inhalation and exhalation, the chest's expansion and contraction turned the switch on and off, respectively. Fig. 6e shows the voltage pattern corresponding to multiple respiration cycles within 200 s. The open-circuit voltage in the respiration test was lower and patterns were denser because we moved the fTEG closer to the chest, where the upper arm has a thicker fat and muscle layer, resulting in a different skin temperature compared to the forearm (∼0.3–0.5 °C difference). This ability to sense respiration beyond movement sensing can play an essential role in health monitoring.
To study the output characteristics of the fTEG (Fig. 6f), the generator was attached to the surface of a hotplate, the program of which was set to 40 °C. By changing the loading resistance, the output voltage was recorded, and the output power was calculated with eqn (3). (3)
Here Vext was the output voltage measured with a multimeter, and Rload was the resistance that was already known. The temperature difference between the heating program (40 °C) and the ambient temperature (20 °C) was ∼20 °C, and the measured open-circuit voltage was 0.327 mV (Fig. 6f), indicating a temperature drop within the thermoelectric gills of 4.51 K based on eqn (2). The internal resistance of the fTEG was measured to be 13.0 Ω, which determined the short circuit current to be 0.0252 mA as the x-intercept of the I–V curve. The maximum power, Pmax = V2/(4Rint), theoretically, could be reached when the external resistance was equal to the internal resistance of the generator, i.e., Rload = Rint.80 Among our measured data, the maximum power attained was 2.10 nW when the external resistance was set to 13.4 Ω. This power output can be further improved with the increase of our limited number of gills to a denser gill structure in one fTEG device, as shown in eqn (2).
In most studies regarding the thermoelectric applications of PANi, much effort has been put into pursuing high power factors (Table S2†).19,58,85 These processing methods include meta-cresol that is defined as acutely toxic by the Globally Harmonized System (GHS). Meanwhile, some drop-casting protocols demand solvent evaporation, which prolongs the processing by hours or days (Table S2†). In contrast, our strategy excluded organic solvents and shortened the processing time. Moreover, very few previous designs converted PANi into a generator capable of harvesting body temperature (Table S2†) via scalable manufacturing. For example, a flexible generator can be fabricated via screen printing a PANi solution onto a polyimide substrate, but the screen printing speeds mainly limited the processing rates.86 In addition, the lack of out-of-plane structures in those devices made it challenging to apply them to a general hot surface with uniform temperature distribution,87,88 such as human skin, a car roof, or a bottle surface demonstrated here.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we fabricated PANi/MWNT composites with improved mechanical and thermoelectric properties through an in situ synthesis method. With an optimized interfacial quality and uniformity at the nanoscale, the in situ polymerization of PANi/58.7 wt% MWNT composites as thermoelectric generator units reached the highest power factor and mechanical robustness, and superior fatigue resistance. A customized TPU flexible substrate was used to organize the thermoelectric materials in a gill-mimicking structure. The attachment of the fTEGs to the surfaces of human skin, hot water bottles, and car roofs efficiently produced well-managed voltage. The human body heat conversion into electricity was also used to power wearable sensors for detecting biosignals of finger movement and aspirational modes. These results demonstrated our fTEG's potential to be incorporated into wearable devices and other broad applications of actuators, robotics, and biomedical implants.
