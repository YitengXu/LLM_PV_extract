The thiophene based core structure is shown to be easily functionalized with four perylene diimides at the four active C–H positions. This new reactivity provides a simple synthetic pathway towards tetrameric perylene diimides which have emerged as one of the best classes of electron acceptors for organic solar cells.
Organic conjugated materials have found utility in an array of applications ranging from photovoltaics to cancer cell imaging.1–3 Interest in these materials stems from the ability to easily alter the chemical structure to fine tune materials properties.4–7 In addition, the ability to render organic conjugated materials soluble has led to major advances in the field of printed electronics.8 The development of practical organic building blocks and synthetic methods from which to construct organic materials suitable for large scale manufacturing is an active area of study.9–11 With respect to the latter, the direct (hetero)arylation reaction has emerged as one of the most useful coupling protocols to make new polymeric and molecular organic materials in a greener fashion.12–16 Direct CH bond functionalization eliminates the need for directing groups and allows for previously unavailable substrates to be utilized.
Specifically, for organic materials, their use as active materials in organic solar cells (OSCs) has been widely studied. Here the organic materials harvest the energy of photons, create free charge carriers and transport charges to electrodes.17 Within the field of OSCs, the development of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) has been one of the hottest topics.18–23 Over the past few years, two classes of NFAs based upon perylene diimide (PDI) and indancenodithiophene (IDT) building blocks have emerged as the best candidates for delivering record breaking OSCs. The IDT based NFAs have an IDT core flanked with planar, electron withdrawing end caps, with the entire molecule rendered electron accepting.24,25 The IDT core is insulated with bulky side chains and serves to shuttle electrons within the molecule while the endcaps drive self-assembly and facilitates electron transfer. The molecules typically adopt a very planar geometry. In contrast, PDI based NFAs are multi-chromophore in nature and best performing materials have highly twisted geometries to prevent strong aggregation of the PDIs, allowing for appropriate phase separation within the active layer films.26–28 While some of the best performing PDI NFAs are dimeric in nature, an emerging trend has been to construct tetrameric PDI NFAs which have recently surpassed the dimers in overall performance.29–32
In this contribution we have extended the DHA coupling method to the PDI and IDT building blocks and have uncovered unprecedented reactivity to yield a new PDI tetrameric structure. The new tetramer adopts a pseudo butterfly structure and functions as a non-fullerene acceptor leading to OSCs with high open-circuit voltages greater than 1 V. This is the first report of such reactivity and opens the possibility for many new creative structures to be constructed.
Based on the success of both PDI compounds, including our N-annulated PDI building block,33 as well as IDT based materials for use as NFAs, our original targeted compound was IDT flanked with N-annulated PDI (IDT–NPDI2) as depicted in Fig. 1A, which is similar in design to previously reported PDI–IDT compounds that showed good OPV performance.34–36 Our group has successfully extended DHA reactivity with our NPDI-Br building block with various coupling partners including diketopyrrolopyrrole37,38 (DPP), isoindigo37 (II), thienyl isoindigo37 (II-TH), squaraine,39 and most recently thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD).40 However, until this study, there is no report of using DHA for couplings between PDI and IDT. While PDI and IDT themselves have been previously coupled, they were pieced together via Stille coupling and required silica-gel column chromatography purification.34–36
 Fig. 1  Reaction between IDT and NPDI under varying conditions using the DHA cross-coupling method. 
Using our optimized DHA conditions, IDT was reacted with 2.0 equivalents of NPDI-Br (Fig. 1A). To our surprise, instead of the bis-substituted product, the reaction proceeded largely to the tetra-substituted product, IDT–NPDI4, with some tris-substituted product in addition to leftover IDT starting material. To probe this reactivity, the same reaction was set up but with 4.2 equivalents of NPDI-Br, however with the increase in NPDI-Br concentration, debromination where a loss of the Br on the NPDI-Br was observed which lead to an incomplete reaction producing the tetramer as the main product but in addition to the mono-, bis-, and tris-substituted products, suggesting a stepwise reaction (Fig. 1B). The individual products proved difficult to separate by silica-gel column chromatography but the fractions isolated were characterized by mass spectroscopy (Fig. S7–S9, ESI†) and found to be mono-, bis-, tris-, and tetra-substituted products. The 1H NMR spectra were convoluted, especially for the bis-substituted product suggesting various substitutions i.e. 2′2, 2′3, 3′3 (Fig. S3–S5, ESI†).
Typically, these alternate substitutions are unwanted and have been seen as a major drawback of DHA reactions which has resulted in studies addressing this unselective C–H activation and how it can be mitigated. This is particularly seen as a problem in direct heteroarylation polymerization (DHAP) reactions where once formed, such ‘defect’ structures are covalently incorporated into the polymer backbone and cannot be removed.41–43 However, in this study, we were eager to exploit this reactivity as a means to access new materials, specifically the tetra-substituted PDI compound, however, we needed to find a way to limit the debromination reaction. It was found that increasing the temperature from 80 °C to 120 °C proved sufficient in limiting the debromination and driving the reaction to further completion resulting in the tetramer as the main product with a small amount of tris-substitution. The tris-substituted product could be removed by an ethyl acetate wash and the tetrameric product, IDT–NPDI4, was isolated as a fine dark red crystalline powder in 70% yield (Fig. 1C). Note we have previously observed debromination of our NPDI-Br building block specifically upon increasing its concentration under DHA-type conditions and its cause is currently under investigation.
To confirm this unprecedented reactivity and tetramer formation, IDT–NPDI4, was identified by NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†), MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig. S6, ESI†) and elemental analysis (Fig. S10, ESI†). The aromatic region of the 1H NMR spectrum is depicted in Fig. 2. The downfield shifted peaks between 8.4–9.2 ppm can be attributed to NPDI (10 NPDI protons for the half molecule). The peaks corresponding to the electron rich IDT core remain further upfield with the singlet at 7.37 ppm corresponding to the para protons on the central phenyl ring of the IDT core.

The optical properties of IDT–NPDI4 were evaluated using UV-Vis spectroscopy (Fig. 3A and Table 1) and photoluminescence spectroscopy (Fig. 3B and Table 1, Fig. S12, ESI†). As expected, with four PDI units, the UV-Vis profile is dominated by NPDI with a high molar absorptivity surpassing 200000 M−1 cm−1, which is approximately four times of that observed for monomeric PDI species. The higher energy absorption from 350–440 nm is attributed to the IDT core. The lack of any significant lower energy absorption bands suggests that there is minimal electron delocalization between the IDT and NPDI units which can be expected due to the likelihood of large dihedral angles between the building blocks as a result of the inherent steric strains. Indeed, large dihedral angles of 180 °C between the NPDI units and IDT core are observed for the theoretical optimized structure calculated by density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP-6-31G(d,p) level of theory. As can be seen in Fig. 4, the NPDI backbones are orthogonal to that of IDT giving the molecule a butterfly-type shape. Minimal change in optical absorption is observed upon transitioning from solution to film suggesting no significant change in molecular organization from solution to solid state. Thin film UV-Vis spectra of the individual components (IDT and NPDI) of IDT–NPDI4 can be viewed in Fig. S11 (ESI†) and assist in the assignment of the optical transitions. The photoluminescence spectra show relatively large stokes shifts for IDT–PDI4 in both solution (0.67 eV; Fig. 3B) and solid state (0.64 eV; Fig. S12, ESI†). Typically, PDI compounds exhibit small stoke shifts so it is postulated that this large red-shifted emission observed may be the result of an intramolecular charge transfer state.

Next, the electrochemical properties were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (Fig. 5 and Table 2). IDT–NPDI4 shows stable ambipolar redox behaviour with two reversible oxidations, the first being attributed to IDT (E1/2 = 0.62 V) and the second NPDI (E1/2 = 1.03 V), and two reversible reductions attributed to NPDI (E1/2 = −1.32 V, −1.57 V) (Fig. 5). The assignments of the oxidation and reduction waves are based on the overlaid cyclic voltammograms of IDT–PDI4 with its individual components, IDT and NPDI (Fig. 5B). The ionization potentials (IP) and electron affinities (EA) were estimated by correlating the onsets of oxidation and reduction, respectively, to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), assuming the IP of Fc/Fc+ to be 4.80 eV. The IP, dominated by the IDT core, was found to be 5.3 eV and the EA, dictated by the NPDI units, was calculated at 3.6 eV.

To test the viability of IDT–NPDI4 to work as a NFA, we fabricated proof of concept OSC devices using the standard donor polymer PTB7-Th. An inverted bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architecture was utilized with active layer processing from chlorobenzene with the solvent additive chloronaphthalene (CN), a common processing method found to improve device performance of PDI OSCs.7 OSC characterization and device metrics are detailed in Fig. 6 and Table 3. The PTB7-Th:IDT–NPDI4 based OSCs showed a good photovoltaic response with devices reaching power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 3.4% using 5% v/v CN processing additive. As seen in Fig. 6A, the OSCs produced high voltages (VOC) above 1 V, but ultimately had modest currents (JSC) from 8–10 mA cm−2 and poor fill factors (FF). Photocurrent generation occurred from 300–800 nm with a maximum from 500–550 nm, which is where IDT–NPDI4 absorbs indicating its significant contribution to photocurrent generation (Fig. 6B). Investigation of the active layer morphology of the best OSC via atomic force microscopy (AFM, Fig. 6C and D) revealed a very smooth film. The electron and hole mobility of the active layer was determined via the space charge limited current (SCLC) method and found to be 4.00 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.74 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (Fig. S14, ESI†). The unbalanced charge transport of the active layer is the primary cause of the lower FF and JSC in this case. Indeed, the shunt resistance is low indicating that free charge carriers are being generated, but not being collected fast enough. While not record performance, these results are quite encouraging as the JSC and FF can be improved through further active layer processing optimization and structural modification. Change in the side-chains at the pyrrolic N-atom position44 on the PDI or replacing the N-atom with S28 or Se27,30 are logical next steps.

In conclusion, we have reported for the first time, the effective use of direct (hetero)arylation cross-coupling method to facilitate four times substitution on a thiophene based core. Specifically, we have coupled an N-annulated PDI chromophore to IDT to yield a new tetrameric molecular semiconductor, IDT–NPDI4, in high yields without the need for rigorous purification. We have demonstrated the utility of IDT–NPDI4 as a non-fullerene acceptor in OSCs. Tetrameric PDIs have emerged as top non-fullerene acceptors for OSCs and this uncovered reactivity, which does not require the use of toxic or costly directing groups, provides a new and streamlined synthetic route to these next-generation energy materials.
