    AbstractWe investigate the low-cost, earth-abundant and air-stable inorganic absorber Sb2S3 that can be processed in the air for organic–inorganic hybrid solar cell applications. To this end, we deposited thin layers of Sb2S3 with thicknesses of 45.0 ± 5, 60.0 ± 7, 80.0 ± 8, 100.0 ± 10 and 120 ± 24 nm by a thermal evaporation method. The absorber Sb2S3 and the hole transporting layer P3HT were annealed under atmospheric conditions at temperatures of 320 and 150 °C for 30 and 10 min in air, respectively, to prepare glass/ITO/TiO2/Sb2S3/P3HT/Ag heterojunction solar cells. We noticed that the values of Jsc, Voc, FF and η were changed with the thickness variation. It is interesting that the best device condition was obtained for a thickness of 100 ± 10 nm achieving an efficiency of 1.94% which was the highest efficiency among the flat structure devices. SEM, XRD, Raman and TEM studies showed that the annealed films were polycrystalline in nature. Further characterization was carried out of the best device by spectroscopic ellipsometry, UV-vis, QE, XPS and UPS. In addition, important electronic and optical properties of Sb2S3 were investigated based on first principles density functional theory (DFT) with generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The obtained experimental values of n, k, ε1 and ε2 are close to the theoretical results.
Introduction
Narrow band gap, low cost, non-toxic and earth-abundant semiconductors have drawn much attention for light-absorbing applications in organic–inorganic hybrid solar cells.1,2 To date, a diverse range of inorganic semiconductors (CdS, PbS, CdTe, CdSe, Cu (In, Ga) Se2, Sb2S3, etc.) have been used as absorbing layer.3,4 Sb2S3 is one of the most promising light harvesting candidates due to its high absorption coefficient (α = 105 cm−1) and mid-direct band gap (1.7–2.5) eV,5 which is suitable for the absorption of visible to near infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.1,2,5 It possesses high photosensitivity ((0.2–7) × 10−4 Ω−1 cm−1 W−1) and high thermoelectric power (75–1050 µV K−1 at −53 °C to 277 °C) with maximum value at 27 °C6 as well as maximum thermal stability of 556 °C.7 In addition, amorphous Sb2S3 readily crystallizes with a slight increase in temperature,7–13 and is stable upon exposure to ambient air opposed to the poor long-term stability and degradation in the atmosphere of polymer solar cells and inorganic–organic hybrid perovskite solar cells.14 A few techniques have been used to synthesize Sb2S3 layers.15–20 Savadogo et al. first deposited a Sb2S3 layer on Si by a chemical method using silicotungstic acid (STA), which led to an efficiency of ∼5.19%.20 An extremely thin absorber (ETA) layer also was deposited by chemical bath deposition for a TiO2/Sb2S3/CuSCN solar cell and achieved an efficiency of 3.37–3.7%.21,22 Chang et al. and Yong et al. reported highest efficiencies of 5.13 and 7.5% for FTO/BL-TiO2/mp-TiO2/Sb2S3/TA/PCPDTBT/Au solar cells.7,23 A solution process to construct a ITO/TiO2/CdS/Sb2S3:P3HT/PEDOT:PSS/Ag solar cell led to efficiency 4.1%24 and 1.29%.25 In addition, several authors have reported TiO2 NRs or NWs-based solar cells with efficiencies of 1.04, 1.47, 2.03, 2.32 and 2.90% for FTO/TiO2NR/Sb2S3/P3HT/Au, FTO/TiO2NW/Sb2S3/Pt/FTO, ITO/TiO2NW/Sb2S3/P3HT/PEDOT:PSS/Au, ITO/TiO2 fiber/Sb2S3/P3HT/PEDOT:PSS/Ag and FTO/ZnO NR/P3HT/Ag, respectively.26–30 To the best of our knowledge, planar structures of FTO/TiO2/Sb2S3/P3HT/Ag, ITO/ZnO/P3HT/Ag, ITO/TiO2/Sb2S3/P3HT/PCBM and ITO/TiO2/mesoporous metal oxides/Sb2S3/P3HT/PEDOT:PSS solar cells show efficiencies of ∼2–1.42%,30 1.14–3.54%,31 and 2.64–3.24%,32 respectively. There are also a few reports regarding increases of the open circuit voltage and power conversion efficiency. The surface treatment of TiO2 by decyl phosphine acid (DPA) demonstrated an increase of open circuit voltage (Voc) due to decrease of the recombination,33 and doping of Mg2+, Ba2+ and Al3+ etc. into TiO2 increases the power conversion efficiency by forming a blocking layer at the interface of the TiO2 and the Sb2S3, which reduces the recombination.34 Yong et al. reported the highest efficiency, 7.5%, of TiO2/Sb2S3 using a treatment of sulfurization with thioacetamide (TA) of an Sb2S3 film.23 In addition, a scaffold Al2O3 or ZrO2 metal oxide layer in the TiO2/Sb2S3/P3HT/PEDOT:PSS solar cell increases the open circuit voltage due to the higher conduction band of Al2O3 or ZrO2 relative to TiO2 where electron injection is impossible.32 In the literature, it is seen that the annealing of Sb2S3 and P3HT was performed in an Ar or N2 filled glove box under stringent conditions which adds to the technique complexity and cost. It should be noted that all the reported solar cells have used high electron accepting mesoporous (mp)-TiO2, nanoporous (np)-TiO2, or TiO2-NRs, TiO2-NWs. There is no report available regarding the processing of Sb2S3 in the air for TiO2/Sb2S3/P3HT heterojunction hybrid solar cell fabrication.
In this work, we deposit Sb2S3 and P3HT layers by thermal evaporation and spin coating methods, and the layers were conveniently annealed under atmospheric conditions, which is both technology-competitive and cost effective. The surface of the Sb2S3 layer was treated by thioacetamide (TA) and the process was conducted by spin-coating followed by thermal annealing at 250 °C that enables reduction of surface defect states (sulfur-deficiency, oxide and sulfate formation) and enhancement of device performance.23,35,36 The device architecture employed is illustrated in Fig. 1.

Results and discussion
Surface morphology
The surface morphology of the as-deposited and annealed films (for 100 ± 10 nm) is shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b). The as-deposited film shows a smooth surface with no observed grain size as expected from its amorphous nature that was further confirmed from the X-ray diffraction (Fig. 3)34,35 and the Raman spectra (Fig. 4). However, the annealed films show a smooth surface and large grain size, clearly identifying the polycrystalline structure. The EDX spectrum (inset Fig. 2(a)) of Sb2S3 shows Sb, O and S elemental peaks where oxygen is overlapped with Sb indicating oxide formation of the Sb2O3 phase. Fig. 2(c) and (d) show low-resolution and selected area electron diffraction (SEAD) TEM images. It is seen from LRTEM (Fig. 2c) that the average grain size is less than 100 nm in accordance with the XRD results. The SAED (Fig. 2d) image shows the crystalline nature of the film as a polycrystalline orthorhombic crystal structure.

X-Ray diffraction

Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of Sb2S3 for thicknesses of 60.0 ± 7 and 100.0 ± 10 nm. In the as-deposited pattern a broad peak is observed which is characteristic of amorphous materials whilst annealed films display several very sharp intense peaks indicating that the film has changed from amorphous to crystalline phase. Sharper intense peaks are observed for the 100 ± 10 nm thickness compared to 60 ± 7 nm, indicating that the 100 ± 10 nm film possesses better crystallinity. According to the JCPDS card no. 42-1393 the diffraction peaks of Sb2S3 at 2θ = 21.53, 25.12, 29.45, 35.41, 43.28, 46.88, 48.54 and 50.79° correspond to (220), (310), (211), (240), (250), (501), (060), and (260) planes of the orthorhombic crystal structure.37 However, an extra peak appears at 45.52° attributed to Sb2O3 in the sample27 and this peak is more significant for the 60 ± 7 nm than the 100 ± 10 nm film. This broadness indicates that low thickness films are more affected by oxygen. The lattice parameters and the grain size of the annealed (100 ± 10) nm film were calculated using relations (1) and (2), respectively: (1) (2)where d is the inter layer spacing, a, b and c are lattice constants, h, k and l are Millar indices, Lg is the average grain size, β is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) in radians, and θ is the diffraction angle. The estimated lattice constants are a = 1.120, b = 1.126, c = 0.381 nm, and the grain size is 33–46 nm for the 100.0 ± 10 nm thin film, which is consistent with the reported values.37,38
Raman spectroscopy
To investigate the degree of crystallinity of Sb2S3 Raman spectra were measured in the wavenumber range of 100–400 cm−1. The typical spectra of Sb2S3 as-deposited and annealed films are shown in Fig. 4. It is seen that as-deposited film shows broad, poorly defined Raman peaks indicating poor crystallinity which is consistent with its disordered amorphous nature,39 whilst the annealed 100 ± 10 nm film showed sharper and more intense peaks compared to the 60 ± 7 nm film, signifying the higher crystallinity of the 100 ± 10 nm Sb2S3 structure.40,41 In the annealed film spectrum, four peaks were observed, one centered at 176 cm−1 corresponding to the vibration of the Sb–Sb bond for Sb2S3 structural units.39 The other three peaks centered at 238, 281 and 304 cm−1 correspond to the antisymmetric S–Sb–S vibration, the antisymmetric vibrations of Sb–S stretching in pyramidal symmetry,39,40 and the symmetric stretching of the Sb–S structural units,41–45 respectively. The presence of these peaks suggests the formation of good crystalline product of Sb2S3.
Optical properties
Spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) is a powerful technique for the exploration of optical constants (n and κ) and the thickness of thin film materials. From the SE measurement these properties can be determined by analyzing the change in polarization state of reflected light from the film surface and developing an optical dispersion model of the film material.46 The optical constants and thickness of the film were found after the goodness of fit of the experimental data to the data generated by the optical model. The fitted transmittance and amplitude data are shown in Fig. 1S1(a and b) (ESI†), respectively. After fitting, the refractive index, extinction coefficient, dielectric constants, absorption coefficient, and the band gap of the film were found for the best device.
Fig. 2S2a (ESI†) shows the absorption spectra of the as-deposited and annealed films of 60.0 ± 7 nm and 100.0 ± 10 nm thickness. The absorption is low for as-deposited films and significantly increased after annealing which is attributed to improved crystallinity. The 100.0 ± 10 nm film shows higher absorption than the 60.0 ± 7 nm film indicating that the former possesses higher crystallinity. As the crystallinity increases, the band gap decreases, resulting in an increased absorption. The absorption coefficient α for the thickness of 100.0 ± 10 nm was calculated both from the spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) and UV-vis spectroscopy measurements and the obtained value of α is greater than 105 cm−1 (Fig. 2S2(b), ESI†). The band gap energy is determined from the (αhν)2 vs. hν curve (Fig. 5a) by drawing an extrapolation of the data points to the photon energy axis where (αhν)2 = 0. The band gap energy was found to be 2.0 eV (from UV-vis) and 2.05 eV (from SE, inset) which is in good agreement with the reported values.16,37,46–51 However, the obtained value is greater than 1.73 eV. The enhancement of the band gap, Eg under these N2 annealing conditions can be attributed to the quantum confinement effect due to nanometric grain size50,52–55 in the film when it is transformed from amorphous into a polycrystalline form. The optical properties measured by the UV-vis spectrometer are almost the same, with only negligible variations. This variation arises from the lack of precision of UV-vis-spectroscopy (or from calculating error) in determining the intrinsic optical properties compared to spectroscopic ellipsometry.

Fig. 5b shows the band dispersion of Sb2S3 along the Brillouin zone path G–Z–T–Y–S–X–U–R. The direct band gap (Eg) was obtained as 1.34 eV, smaller than the experimental values, and the band structures were consistent with a previous report.56 It is well known that DFT calculations always underestimate values due to exchange correlation functions.57 In particular, DFT seems to systematically underestimate the band gap in insulators and semiconductors by about 30–40%.58

Fig. 6a shows the change of refractive index n and extinction coefficient k of Sb2S3 derived from SE. A dominant peak is observed at ∼1.60 eV in the n plot attributed to the absorption edge (Fig. 2S2a†). The maximum values of n and k were obtained as 3.20 and 1.95 at energies of 1.60 and 3.5 eV, while from theoretical calculations, values were 3.35 and 2.25, at energies of 2.14 and 4.46 eV, respectively (Table 1). It is significant that the theoretical values of n and k are close to the experimental values. Fig. 6(b) and (c) show the dielectric nature of Sb2S3 obtained from SE and theoretical study. It is obvious that the calculated theoretical values are in very good agreement with the experiment results (Table 1). Thus, our optical study established that theoretical results are much closer to the results obtained from the SE technique.

X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and UPS
Both Sb2S3 and P3HT can be oxidized in the air which affects the device performance.58 Under atmospheric annealing conditions, samples may be contaminated which subsequently can create deep trap levels below the conduction band that can act as recombination centers of the carriers and as a result the open circuit voltage (Voc) of the device can be deteriorated.35 In view of this, we examined the chemical state of Sb2S3 and P3HT layers using highly powerful depth-profiling X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. 7(a)–(c) depict the XPS spectra for S2p, Sb3d and C1s up to 10.15 nm depth, respectively. From Fig. 7(a) and (c) it is seen that both S2p and C1s core level positions are shifted toward lower binding energy and the intensity of the shifted peak decreases with increasing sputtering thickness which indicates that the P3HT surface is contaminated, and is attributed to ambient oxygen. The shifting is found to be 0.74 and 0.75 eV for C1s and S2p, respectively. After sputtering 10.15 nm no peak shift is observed (not shown here). The Sb3d core level exhibits two chemical states of Sb2S3 at 530.0 eV (Sb3d5/2) and 538.25 eV (Sb3d3/2) (Fig. 7b′) and their spin–orbit splitting is found to be 8.25 eV, in good agreement with results in refs. 30 and 49. In Fig. 7b′ (inset) the deconvolution reveals Sb2S3 (1 and 1′), Sb2O3 (2 and 2′) and an oxygen overlapping peak (3).30 These spectra confirmed that the Sb2S3 film could be easily oxidized and form Sb2O3 (531.63 eV) which is in accord with XRD results. When the sample is etched by Ar+ ion sputtering for 60 s (10.15 nm thickness), the O1s peak disappeared as shown in Fig. 7b, indicating the Sb2O3 phase is only present on the surface of the Sb2S3 film.30

The thickness of the oxide layer is estimated using the following formulae (3) (3)where, IO and ISb are the intensities of the overlapping peak oxygen (18%) and Sb peak (82%), λ = 1.2 nm is the inelastic mean free path for ∼500 eV photoelectrons, θ = 0° is the polar angle, d is the oxide thickness and the value of overall peak intensity was found to be 82% (Sb2S3) and 18% (Sb2O3). The obtained oxide thickness is found to be ∼0.51 nm. The Sb2O3 chemical state in the Sb2S3 may be introduced from the two possible sources, (i) when the evaporation chamber is cooled down to RT and immediately exposed to air and (ii) under an atmospheric N2 annealing process which is more favorable for O2 formation. Under these conditions Sb would more readily react with O2 than S due to the higher standard molar reaction enthalpy (−718 kJ mol−1) and larger Gibbs free energy (−605 kJ mol−1) of Sb2O3 than enthalpy (−262 kJ mol−1) and Gibbs free energy (−222 kJ mol−1) of Sb2S3.2

Fig. 7d shows the UPS, illustrating the band alignment of Sb2S3. The work function, φ was calculated using the relation, φ = photon energy (hν) − high binding energy cutoff. Thus, φ = 21.22 − 16.65 eV = 4.57 eV, which is equivalent to the possible Fermi level position with respect to the vacuum level. The lower binding energy onset and the higher binding energy cutoff are found to be 2.45 and 16.65 eV (corrected for −5 V) (shown as insets, Fig. 7d(i) and (ii)). The valence band maximum and the conduction minimum were determined to be V.B = φ + B.Eonset = 4.57 + 2.45 = 7.02 eV and C.B = (7.02 − 2.0) eV = 5.02 eV, and Fermi level = 5.02 − 4.57 eV = 0.45 eV below the conduction band, where 2.0 eV is the optical band gap as found from UV-vis spectroscopy data. UPS analysis demonstrates that the ionization potential and work function of this oxidized Sb2S3 surface is at 7.02 and 4.57 eV, respectively. This thin oxide layer at the interface passivates the Sb2S3 surface, consequently electron–hole recombination is reduced, that helps to improve the device performance.
Photovoltaic conversion efficiency and external quantum efficiency

Fig. 8 shows the J–V characteristics of glass/ITO/TiO2/Sb2S3/P3HT/Ag hybrid solar cells. It is seen that the thickness of Sb2S3 strongly affects the power conversion efficiency of the device. The solar cell parameters of all devices were determined from the J–V characteristics which are listed in Table 2. It is obvious that the solar cell parameters were varied: Jsc = 2.41–7.41 mA cm−2, Voc = 385–605 mV, FF = (37.8–43.2)%, and η = 0.36–1.94% (Table 2) with the variation of absorber thickness. The device with a thickness of 45 ± 7 nm shows the lowest power conversion efficiency. The low conversion efficiency arises from the low light absorption implying that photon energy cannot induce many excitons.59 The shunt resistance decreases with the increase of film thickness, due to the variation of the specific electronic structure of the film, which increases the absorbance (Fig. 2S2a†) (α = 2.303A/d, where A is the absorbance and d is the film thickness) of the photon energy resulting in an increase in the photogeneration electron–hole pairs.26 It is clear from Table 2 that Voc and Jsc change in a systematic manner with the thickness variation. The increase of Voc and Jsc with thickness is attributed to the variation of the electronic structure (reduction in band gap)60 and increase in built in voltage (Vbi)61 as well as the increase of crystallinity. It should be noted that the Sb2S3 and P3HT layers were annealed in the air and there is an induced oxygen affect on the device performance. It is clearly seen in the XRD patterns (Fig. 3) that the 60 ± 7 nm film shows a broader Sb2O3 peak than the 100 ± 10 nm film. Thus the 60 ± 7 nm film is more affected by oxygen than the 100 ± 10 nm film. This oxide layer subsequently can create deep trap levels below the conduction band that can act as recombination centers of the carriers and as a result the open circuit voltage (Voc) of the device can be deteriorated.35 As the absorber thickness is increased, the oxide layer thickness presumably decreases, resulting in lower parasitic and or recombination losses and hence the short circuit current and the open circuit voltage increased. It is interesting that a maximum power conversion efficiency is obtained for 100 ± 10 nm thickness which is attributed to the increase of crystallinity (Fig. 3), shunt resistance (Table 2), and interfacial properties of electrically active Sb2S3/P3HT interfaces.30 However, when the film thickness is increased to 120 ± 24 nm, the power conversion efficiency, short-circuit current density, and open circuit voltage are a slightly decreased. The decrease of Voc and Jsc might be associated with both the eventual electric shunts due to the crystal structure, energy level alignment, and the increase of the internal recombination process.26,30 In general, thick films provide high absorbance and thus more likely generation of a higher quantity of excitons. However, excitons rather recombine than dissociate and can recombine before reaching the p–n interfacial layer with a built-in electric field and hence the power conversion efficiency of a thick film device deteriorates.26,29,30 It is reported that the exciton binding energy in bulk Sb2S3 is in the range 10–50 meV.62,63 The lower value of the exciton binding energy indicates that the excitons in Sb2S3 are loosely bound.63

Fig. 9(a) and (b) show the J–V characteristics and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the best device. It can be seen that the onset of carrier generation contributing to Jsc occurs at a wavelength of 740 nm and the offset at wavelength 350 nm, which indicates that the Sb2S3 layer actively participates in the photocurrent generation within the wavelength range 350–740 nm (Fig. 9b) and its maximum value is ∼34%. No EQE response is observed above 750 nm which indicates the absence of a charge contribution from Sb2S3 to P3HT. The short circuit current density is 6.12 mA cm−2 and the band gap is 1.80 eV. The obtained value of Jsc from EQE is lower than obtained from J–V measurement (7.40 mA cm−2). This discrepancy could arise due to the refractive index of the material (P3HT) used on the front surface of the device where light is reflected and absorbed. A peak is observed at wavelength ∼688 nm, consistent with the absorption edge (Fig. 2S2a†), and is equivalent to a band gap energy ∼1.80 eV. In the wavelength range 450–650 nm, the EQE value decreases attributed to the absorption of light by the P3HT surface, however, the charges generated by P3HT were incompletely transferred to the Ag electrode. On the other hand, a sharp decline of the EQE value is observed between wavelengths of 688 and 740 nm presumably due to deeper penetration of light into the film and hence charge carrier collection decrease, resulting in EQE decrease from 30 to 3%. A decrease of EQE seen in the wavelength range 400–500 nm is associated with parasitic absorption by the Sb2S3 absorber layer. In addition, the peak at 390 nm is caused by the UV light absorption of TiO2. A fraction of short wavelength photons is absorbed at shorter wavelength and hence the PCE is lower for this device. From Fig. 9b it is also seen that the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) is larger than the EQE, which indicates that absorbed photons are converted to photocurrent, which satisfies the general relation IQE = EQE/(1 − reflection − transmission). In addition, a lower value of EQE than IQE implies that some produced internal photocurrent is lost by inefficient charge collection and inefficient electron extraction through the Sb2S3/P3HT interface.

Conclusion
A series of glass/ITO/TiO2/Sb2S3/P3HT/Ag hybrid solar cells was successfully processed in the air. Both the absorber and hole transporting layer are oxidized as confirmed from XRD and XPS depth profiling studies. The values of solar cell parameters were varied with the absorber thickness variation: Jsc = 2.41–7.41 mA cm−2, Voc = 385–605 mV, FF = 37.8–43.2%, and η = 0.36–1.94% . The maximum power conversion efficiency was found to be 1.94% and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) was ∼34%. The obtained theoretical results are in excellent agreement with the experiment results. Our optical study established that theoretical results are much closer to the results obtained from the viable SE technique. However, the large dielectric constant and refractive index, suggest that the exciton binding energy in Sb2S3 should be relatively small and an anti-reflective coating is recommended to enhance the light absorption for application as a promising photoactive material of n–i–p hybrid solar cells, and to improve the device efficiency, the process should be done and optimized in an air protecting environment.
Experimental
Device fabrication
Indium doped tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrate (1.7 × 1.7 cm) with a sheet resistance of 10 Ω sq−1 was used as a cathode to fabricate a hybrid photovoltaic solar cell. A sol–gel solution of 0.254 M titanium isopropoxide and 0.02 M HCl in anhydrous ethanol was spin cast at 2.5k rpm for 60 s and annealed in air at 250 °C for 10 min. The process was repeated a second time to ensure a uniform film, followed by thermal annealing on a hot plate at 500 °C for 30 min, and a crystalline compact thin film of TiO2 was obtained with a thickness ∼32 nm. Prior to depositing a compact layer of TiO2, the substrate was subsequently cleaned in Decon 90, acetone, ethanol and deionized water with the assistance of an ultrasonic agitation bath, each for 15 min, and then dried in nitrogen gas flow and finally cleaned in a UV–ozone cleaner chamber for 10 min. A series of 45.0 ± 5, 60.0 ± 7, 80.0 ± 8, 100.0 ± 10 and 120 ± 24 nm thin films of Sb2S3 were prepared by thermal evaporation method at a base pressure of 2.4 × 10−6 mbar with a deposition rate of 0.04 nm s−1. The deposited Sb2S3 layers were annealed at a temperature of 320 °C for 30 min on a hot plate covering with a pyrex beaker and N2 was flowed into the beaker.64 After 30 min annealing, the hot plate was set at 200 °C and heated for 10 min in air to prevent oxide formation. Moreover, the surface of Sb2S3 was modified by 0.15 g mL−1 thioacetamide (TA) in DMF solution spin cast at 2.5k rpm for 60 s, followed by thermal annealing at 250 °C for 2 min under N2 flow. A layer of P3HT (∼60 nm) was then deposited on the TA treated Sb2S3 layer by spin coating using a solution of P3HT (15 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) followed by annealing on the hot plate at 150 °C for 10 min to increase the interface contact between Sb2S3 and P3HT as well as increase the charge carrier mobility of P3HT.65 Finally, the anode Ag (150 nm) layer was deposited (a shadow mask was used) by thermal evaporation method with a deposition rate of 0.15 nm s−1. The solar cell area was 0.09 cm2.

Fig. 1a shows the cross-section and architecture (inset, 100 ± 10 nm) of the full device that also comprises a TiO2 blocking layer that is needed to prevent the holes reaching to the ITO electrode. The Sb2S3 layer serves as the photoactive layer that generates electron–hole pairs. P3HT is chosen as a hole-transporting layer owing to its high drift mobility. The Ag and ITO layers serve as the anode and cathode, respectively. The device function and performance are strongly dependent on the charge transfer process across the interfacial structures of the organic and inorganic semiconductors as well as the electrode. The charges are generated in the Sb2S3 layer, electrons jump from the valence band to the conduction band of Sb2S3 and then move towards the conduction band of TiO2 meanwhile holes into the P3HT layer (Fig. 1b) and they recombine in the output circuit through the connecting ITO and Ag layer.
Characterization
The surface morphology and the cross-section of the device were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (Philips XL30 FEG). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were collected by a high resolution TEM with 200 keV (Philips FEG TEM CM200). X-Ray diffraction (analytical Philips X’Pert diffraction) data were taken in the range 20–70° with a step width 0.02°. UV-vis measurements were conducted at RT in the wavelength range 380–800 nm (Perkin Elmer lambda 2S) and spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) measurement was carried out using a J.-A. Woolson Jewel (M-2000) apparatus. To investigate crystallinity, the Raman spectra were taken on a Renishaw-Invia micro-Raman spectrometer (excitation wavelength 514 nm). X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS: PHI 5802) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS: VG ESCALAB 220i-XL) readings were taken to examine any oxidition effects and the band alignment. The external quantum efficiency was measured by an Oriel IQE 200 set-up and current density–voltage (J–V) readings were measured with the assistance of air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) illumination, a calibrated solar simulator with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (1 sun).
To study the electronic and optical properties of Sb2S3, the first principles ultrasoft pseudopotential method was used within the framework of density functional theory (DFT) with generalized gradient approximation (GGA) as implemented in the CASTEP code.66 The basis set of the valence electronic states is taken as: 5s25p3 and 3s23p4 for Sb and S, respectively. The cutoff energy is taken as 500 eV and using a 3 × 9 × 3 Monkhorst–pack grid for the sampling of the Brillouin zone. The space group of Sb2S3 is pm (No. 62) and the atomic positions are: Sb1 (0.5293, 0.25, 0.1739); Sb2 (0.6495, 0.75, 0.4640); S1 (0.6251, 0.75, 0.0614); S2 (0.7079, 0.25, 0.3083) and S3 (0.4503, 0.75, 0.3769). Geometrical optimization was conducted using the convergence of thresholds of 5 × 10−6 eV per atom for the total energy and 0.01 eV Å−1 (maximum force), 0.02 GPa (maximum stress), 5 × 10−4 Å (maximum displacement), 0.5 (Gaussian smearing), respectively.
