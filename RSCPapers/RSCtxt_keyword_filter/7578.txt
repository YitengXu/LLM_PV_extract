    , Accepted 20th June 2021First published on 21st June 2021AbstractColloidal quantum dot solar cells (CQDSCs) have achieved remarkable progress recently in terms of mainly surface passivation and composition-matching matrices on CQDs, while improving the overall photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) through electron transport layer (ETL) modifications is less explored. We report a low-temperature solution route to synthesize donor (Al3+/Ga3+/In3+) incorporated zinc oxide (AZO/GZO/IZO) ETL films for PbS CQDSCs. Spectroscopic characterization studies indicate that the IZO ETL fabricated with 150 °C annealing can increase the bandgap the most from 3.56 eV to 3.74 eV, possesses enhanced light transmission (∼94%) and finer particle sizes, and importantly shows the most suitable band alignment and charge transfer ability. Well-dispersed PbS CQDs of around 3 nm are synthesized by a N2-protected reflux method and are surface exchanged with 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (EMII) to allow I− grafting and ethanedithiol (EDT) for the active layer and hole transport layer, respectively. The IZO based PbS CQDSC, with a device architecture of ITO/IZO/PbS-EMII/PbS-EDT/Au, shows an enhanced PCE of 11.1% (comparatively 18% higher than that of the ZnO ETL), a VOC value of 0.64 V, and a JSC of 25.8 mA cm−2. The improved performances benefit from the higher recombination resistance and constrained photoluminescence emission with the utilization of the IZO ETL that provides a superior charge transfer property.
1. Introduction
Inorganic photovoltaic devices e.g. solar cells, due to their superior stability, have gained extensive interest over the years. Among the emerging new-generation photovoltaic materials, colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) have been extensively studied because of their facile solution synthesis path and size-tunable features that enable efficient absorption across the solar spectrum.1,2 This allows the CQD solar cells (CQDSCs) to benefit from the effective multiple exciton generation,3,4 their energy levels,5 carrier concentration,6,7 stability,8 and lifetime9 that can be controlled through the surface chemistry. These advantages allow the CQDSCs not only to bring about performance optimizations for single-junction cells but also to demonstrate great potential in multi-junction cells that complement perovskites and silicon.
Having demonstrated increasingly enhanced power conversion, PbS CQDSCs are quite promising because of the large Bohr exciton radii (≈18 nm) for PbS,10 high light conversion quantum yield, etc. In particular, PbS has high photo-sensitivity in the near-infrared spectrum11 that allows the optical band gap to be tuned to a wide range of around 0.7–2.1 eV.12 The electronic structure or band edges of PbS CQDs could be shifted significantly only through slightly modifying the chemical ligands which provides a better chance to achieve full use of solar light.13 In order to further improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE), considerable efforts have been devoted to explorations, modifications, and optimizations of aspects such as surface passivation and device layout.14,15 These actions, on the one hand, could improve the carrier mobility or photocarrier diffusion length for PbS CQDSCs, and on the other hand, could facilitate the charge transfer in-between the CQDs while simultaneously preventing the formation of surface-located electronic trap states. Although the PbS CQDSCs have realised significant developments and progress as the single-junction based cells have achieved a power conversion exceeding 10.6%, the photocarrier diffusion length is normally limited to within a thickness of 300 nm, because the photocarrier transport is quite sensitive to the thickness of the active layer.16 Fortunately, Xu et al. proposed a matrix engineering strategy by introducing a two-dimensionally confined matrix to increase the structural and energetic disorder, which increases the diffusion length up to 600 nm while achieving a PCE of 12%.17 Very recently, Sun et al. implemented a perovskite (FABr) monolayer bridge to improve the interdot coupling of PbS CQDs and meanwhile minimize the gap across which carriers need to tunnel. The highest PCE of 13.8%, to date, with an optimum active layer (FABr-PbS) thickness of ≈440 nm, was achieved.18 These merits render the PbS CQDSCs furthermore promising for photovoltaic applications.
As a matter of fact, like the light absorber layer, the electron transporting layer (ETL), such as zinc oxide (ZnO),19,20 titanium dioxide (TiO2)21 and tin dioxide (SnO2),22 also plays a crucial role in improving the overall PCE, which however is less explored. ZnO is currently a prominent ETL for PbS CQDSCs due to its solution processing and well matched energy level. The ZnO ETL could not only carry the electrons but also block the holes in PbS CQDSCs; however, the preparation of a high-quality ZnO ETL by the sol–gel process normally needs a high sintering temperature, e.g. >300 °C.20,23 Additionally, a better ETL requires a relatively wide bandgap to transmit more high-energy photons for the generation of photocurrent products and meanwhile maintains high mobility and high conductivity.24 To increase the bandgap, the ZnO ETL was doped with, e.g., gallium (Ga), magnesium (Mg) and aluminum (Al), to effectively change its properties.25–27 Hu et al. employed ZnMgO/PbS CQDSCs with the incorporation of graphene and chlorinated graphene oxide into TBAI-PbS and EDT-PbS to achieve a PCE of 9.0%.28 It is thus believed that a proper incorporation into ZnO using low-temperature solution strategy, would potentially open a simple and powerful avenue to break through the carrier transport bottleneck, upgrading the CQDSCs’ performance to a new level.
Targeting further efficiency improvement in PbS CQDSCs, in this work, we chose donor indium (In3+), aluminium (Al3+) and gallium (Ga3+) to incorporate into the ZnO ETL in terms of broadening the bandgap and tailoring the transport properties. It is promising that previously the IZO has been confirmed as an ETL showing an improved PCE, e.g. in inverted polymer solar cells (9.27%),29 planar perovskite solar cells (16.25%),30 and flexible perovskite solar cells (18.1%).31 Although a ZnO ETL with 3 at% In3+ doping has been adopted by Liu et al. and a PCE of 10.8% has been achieved using PbS-TBAI as an active absorber layer,32 single junction CQDSCs with PbS-EMII active absorber layers have not been explored. Herein, the IZO ETL was fabricated by a low-temperature (<300 °C) solution spin-coating method and PbS CQDs were synthesized by a N2-protected reflux method. The as-synthesized PbS CQDs are well dispersed and uniform with an average size of 3 nm, and are further surface exchanged with 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (EMII) to allow I− grafting and ethanedithiol (EDT) for the active layer and hole transport layer, respectively. A single-junction solar cell having the device configuration of glass/ITO/IZO/PbS-EMII/PbS-EDT/Au was adopted for CQDSCs and demonstrates a superior performance with open-circuit voltage (VOC) = 0.64 V, short circuit current density (JSC) = 25.8 mA cm−2, fill factor (FF) = 68% and PCE = 11.1%, which is 18% higher than that of the ZnO ETL (9.4%).
2. Experimental section
2.1. Synthesis of lead sulfide (PbS) colloidal quantum dots (CQDs)
To synthesize PbS CQDs, 0.9 g of lead oxide (PbO) was first dissolved in a three-neck round bottom flask containing 20 ml of 1-octadecene (ODE) and 3 ml of oleic acid (OA).22 The system was stirred and degassed for 15 hours. Then, the temperature of the system was raised gradually from room temperature to 105 °C. After the PbO was wholly broken down to form lead oleate (the color changes from yellow to clear), 320 μl of bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide (TMS) dissolved in 10 ml of pumped ODE was rapidly injected into the three-neck flask under a N2 environment. Following this, the reaction mixture changes color from colorless to dark brown. After reaction for a few minutes, PbS nanocrystals (or CQDs) form. After cooling down to room temperature naturally, the solution in the flask was dissolved in 3 ml of octane and was precipitated with acetone, followed by centrifugation. By washing 4–5 times, purified CQDs can be obtained. Finally, the PbS CQDs were dried in a vacuum and dissolved in octane with a concentration of 45 mg ml−1.
2.2. Synthesis of ZnO and IZO films
A sol–gel combined spin coating method was adopted for the synthesis of the ZnO and IZO films based on a previously reported method in the literature.33 The undoped ZnO sol–gel was prepared by dissolving 60 μl of ethanolamine (C2H7NO) and 0.2 g of zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(Ac)2·2H2O) in 2 ml of 2-methoxyethanol (C3H8O2). Solutions of In3+, Al+3 and Ga+3 doped ZnO were obtained by adding indium chloride (InCl3), aluminium chloride (AlCl3) and gallium chloride (GaCl3) with a molar ratio of 1%. Afterward, the solution was stirred at room temperature for 24 hours to form a homogeneous and transparent solution.
For the spin-coating fabrication of the films, the ITO/glass substrates were ultra-sonicated in deionized water for 15 minutes, and then in ethanol for 20 minutes. All the washed ITO substrates were dried for 30 minutes in an oven at 75 °C, followed by a UV ozone treatment for 15 minutes, and then kept overnight. ZnO, AZO and GZO precursor solutions were spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 40 seconds on a precleaned ITO/glass substrate and annealed for 30 minutes at 150 °C in air to allow crystallization followed by repeating these steps 3 times to get the required thickness of the film. Similar conditions and procedures were performed for the synthesis of the IZO films, which were further annealed at 150 °C, 200 °C, 250 °C and 300 °C, respectively.
2.3. Fabrication of the IZO or ZnO based PbS CQDSC devices
The as-deposited ZnO or IZO ETL films were transferred into a N2 filled glove box for the deposition of the PbS CQD active layer. The active layer was fabricated by a layer by layer (LBL) method. EMII was used for ligand exchange. PbS CQDs were dropped on the ZnO or IZO coated ITO substrate and spun at 2500 rpm for 30 seconds. After the first layer deposition, EMII solution (10 mg ml−1 in methanol) was deposited for OA exchange, followed by three-time washing in methanol to remove the residual EMII at a spinning speed of 2500 rpm for 10 seconds. The above PbS-EMII CQDs depostion steps, were repeated 8–10 times to get the required absorber layer thickness. Subsequently, two layers of EDT (0.02% volume EDT in ACN solution) exchanged PbS CQDs as the HTL layer were spin-coated, followed by two-time washing with ACN. Finally, the Au electrode layer was coated on the PbS-EDT layer via a thermal evaporation method. After thermal evaporation, the solar cell devices were annealed at 80 °C for 5 minutes, and were used for characterization studies and photoelectric measurements.
2.4. Structure characterization methods and photoelectric measurements
The crystalline structures and the phase purity of PbS CQDs, ZnO, and IZO were examined by using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Smartlab). The absorption spectra of PbS CQDs and the transmittance of ZnO and IZO were obtained using a UV-Vis spectrometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 650S and 1050). The valence states and chemical compositions of ZnO, IZO and PbS-EMII films were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Fisher Escalab 250Xi) with Al Kα source radiation. Surface morphologies, particle sizes and dispersions were determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Zeiss Gemini 500), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F) and atomic force microscopy (AFM, Asylum Research Cypher S). Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on a photoluminescence spectrometer (Edinburgh FLS 1000). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on an IR spectrometer (Bruker ALPHA II). The photoelectric properties e.g., current-density and external quantum efficiency (EQE) were measured on a semiconductor system (Keithley 2400 and Agilent A1500) under simulated AM1.5G (100 mA cm−2) illumination from a 150 W xenon lamp as the light source at room temperature. AC impedance spectroscopy measurements were performed using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E) under stimulated AM1.5G (100 mA cm−2) illumination. The frequencies ranged from 1 Hz to 1 MHz with an alternating signal amplitude of 0.01 V.
3. Results and discussion
The steps followed from PbS colloidal quantum dot (CQD) synthesis and modifications to multi-layer film formation for colloidal quantum dot solar cells (CQDSCs) are presented in Fig. 1. Firstly, we focused on the synthesis and fabrication of the electron transporting layer (ETL), i.e. the ZnO or In3+, Al3+ and Ga3+ doped ZnO (IZO, AZO and GZO) film, which was synthesized by a spin coating method. The sol/solution used for spin coating consists of zinc acetate [Zn(CH3COO)2] and/or InCl3, AlCl3 and GaCl3 in stoichiometric amounts that were dissolved in ethanolamine and 2-methoxyethanol. The spin-coated films were then annealed at different temperatures, e.g. 150–300 °C for 30 minutes, to remove the solvents and reach crystallization.

As the compatibility and matching ability between the ETL and absorption layer directly determine the charge transfer and transport behaviors, the spectroscopic characterization methods e.g. UV-vis and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) were performed to shed light on the bandgap (Eg) structure. Fig. 2a shows the Tauc plots of the ETL films calculated from the UV-vis spectra, which yield Eg values for the ETL, i.e. 3.56 eV for ZnO, 3.58 eV for AZO, 3.60 eV for GZO and 3.74 eV for IZO, respectively. It is clear that IZO exhibits the largest Eg, that is, In3+ incorporation into ZnO could increase the bandgap the most, thus being favorable for CQDSCs. Fig. 2b–e show the UPS measurements that give rise to the energy level of the ETL and PbS-EMII. The corresponding low binding energy tail (Eon-set), high binding energy cutoff (Ecut-off) and valence band maximum (VBM) values were obtained (also summarized in Table S1†). Based on the VBM and Eg results, conduction band minimum (CBM) values can be calculated, i.e. 4.11 eV for ZnO, 4.13 eV for AZO, 4.16 eV for GZO and 4.22 eV for IZO. Accordingly, an energy band diagram was proposed as shown in Fig. 4f, where IZO demonstrates the deepest ECB and VBM compared to ZnO, AZO and GZO. Therefore, the IZO ETL shows the superior ability, on the one hand, to align well with the PbS-EMII absorber layer that facilitates the achievement of a barrier-free energetic configuration and realization of faster electron injection and transport from PbS-EMII to the ETL, and on the other hand, to block the holes efficiently to prevent flow back that helps to increase the JSC value of the solar cells. Besides matching the band alignment, the IZO ETL was chosen for the systematic investigation on the photoelectric responses, while undoped ZnO was also studied for comparison.

First of all, the as-prepared IZO and ZnO ETL films were fully characterized to obtain the quality and microstructural information. XRD analysis was performed to check the overall structure and phase purity of ZnO and IZO (Fig. 3a). All the diffraction peaks for both ZnO and IZO annealed at different temperatures can be indexed to the hexagonal wurtzite structure of ZnO (JCDPS no. 36-1451). The diffraction lines for the 2θ positions at around 31.70, 34.20, 35.90, and 56.60 correspond to the (100), (002), (101), and (110) planes of the ZnO crystal lattice, respectively.34–36 No peaks related to the Zn/In-based or other impurities were observed in the XRD pattern, indicating that pure ZnO or IZO films were synthesized. It is also clear from the XRD patterns that at a low annealing temperature, peaks are slightly widened, indicating small size particles for the IZO films that are consistent with the SEM and AFM observations. To explore the possible electronic state structure upon In3+ doping, XPS was conducted. As expected, In and Zn have normal stable oxidation states, i.e. In3+ and Zn2+, respectively (Fig. S1 & Table S2†). Fig. 3c and d show the core-level spectrum of oxygen (O) 1s for ZnO and IZO films. The binding energy centered at 530.3 eV for ZnO and 529.3 eV for IZO corresponds to the lattice oxygen, while the quite strong peak at a higher energy shoulder (531.8 eV for ZnO and 530.6 eV for IZO) is attributed to the surface oxygen, e.g. hydroxyl OH groups.37 It is clearly seen that the oxygen vacancies have been greatly reduced by incorporating In3+, which would reduce the electron trapped states in IZO, thus favoring the charge/electron transportation.38 Due to their significant influences on the photovoltaic effect, the transmittance and absorption properties of ZnO and IZO were investigated, with the room-temperature recorded spectra shown in Fig. 3b. All the film samples have a similar thickness of ≈50 nm and display a high transparency of over 90% in the visible region. The stable transmittance curves imply that all films are uniform and smooth. As clearly seen from the inset of Fig. 3c, the pure ZnO film annealed at 150 °C has a transmittance of about 92%, while this is slightly higher for IZO films at over 93%. A higher annealing temperature leads to a slight decrease in transmittance, which may be due to the defect-induced photon and crystalline scattering. Eventually, the microstructure and topography of the ZnO and IZO films annealed at 150 °C were characterized (Fig. 3e–h). As observed from SEM and AFM, both films demonstrate good crystallinity, smooth surface, and uniformly distributed particles as well as sizes, but IZO possesses obviously finer particles that enable increasing the effective contact with the active layer. On increasing the annealing temperature, the particle size and roughness of the films increase, as confirmed by the SEM and AFM observations (Fig. S2†). Due to its multiple advantages, the IZO film annealed at 150 °C was used to fabricate the CQDSCs further.

Before the assembly of the entire CQDSCs, we firstly performed the synthesis and structural characterization studies of the PbS CQDs, as shown in Fig. 4a and S3.† The PbS CQDs were synthesized by a N2-protected reflux method in a three-neck round flask using OA as the capping ligand and ODE as the reaction solvent which has a relatively high boiling point necessary for high-temperature reactions. The synthesized PbS CQDs have a cubic structure (Fig. S3†) and were well dispersed with average dimensions of around 3 nm (Fig. 4a-inset) that can be ascribed definitely to the colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) as PbS has a Bohr exciton radius of 18 nm. Before ligand exchange with EMII, the OA capped PbS CQDs, as characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy (Fig. 4a), demonstrate a maximum adsorption peak at 870 nm, consistent with the characteristic of the d-d electron hopping for PbS. The PbS CQDs can completely cover the visible-light range absorption with an absorption edge at around 972 nm (∼1.28 eV), benefiting photovoltaic devices. By using the Moreels equation, the particle size of the PbS CQDs can be estimated to be 2.8 nm,39 consistent with the TEM observations.

The synthesized PbS CQDs were further deposited on the ZnO and IZO ETL films to fabricate the solar cell active layer via a LBL technique following the steps illustrated in Fig. 1b-II. To enhance the light absorption for the active layer, the as-deposited PbS CQDs were further treated to allow surface adsorbed organic ligand exchange with EMII (Fig. 1b-III).22,40 The ligand exchange principle is given in Fig. 1a, in which the surface OA was replaced by the iodine group. This process can be well clarified from the FT-IR spectra by comparing the PbS CQDs before and after EMII treatments (Fig. 4b). The results showed that the directly synthesized PbS CQDs are covered with a layer of surface OA, while the PbS-EMII treated film has almost no typical OA ligand vibration peaks (i.e., C–H, CO). XPS spectroscopy was performed to determine the valence states, with the profiles for Pb 4f, and S 2p levels shown in Fig. 4c and d (broad-scan survey spectra, I 3d and oxygen peaks are seen in Fig. S4 & Table S3†). Pb exhibits two main peaks with binding energies at 138.1 eV and 142.9 eV that can be attributed to the Pb f5/2 and f7/2 levels, respectively, as well as noticeably two minor higher-energy shoulders, suggesting the existence of a tiny amount of oxidized Pb (Fig. 4c). This is consistent with the results that the O 1s was also detected in terms of the oxygen-based ligands (like –COO and –OH groups) that are linked to the (111) facets of PbS CQDs.13 The profiles for I 3d (Fig. S4b†) and S 2p (Fig. 4d) are highly symmetric and their binding energy (619.2 and 630.6 eV for I 3d; 161.1 and 162.3 eV for S 2p) is coincident with the results indicating the normal states, i.e. I1− and S2− anions.
To investigate the quality and surface structure of the as-deposited PbS CQD films and EMII treated PbS films, SEM and AFM were employed (Fig. 4e–h). It is clear that both the PbS film and PbS-EMII films are uniform and compact in surface morphology with a quite small roughness. After the EMII ligand exchange, the PbS-EMII film (Fig. 4g and h) becomes denser, and smoother, which is beneficial for the further fabrication of the hole transport layer (HTL). The HTL fabrication proceeded on the ITO/IZO/PbS-EMII film, using the directly EDT treated PbS CQDs by the spin coating method (Fig. 1b-IV). Analogous to the PbS-EMII, the EDT (in acetonitrile) can also remove the surface OA from the as-synthesized PbS by ligand exchange to form PbS-EDT (Fig. 1a). Eventually, the PbS CQDSC device was fabricated by a final step of electrode Au layer deposition (Fig. 1b-V).
The optimum PbS CQDSC device was then used for photoelectric measurements. Along with the designed device architecture, the cross section of the IZO based CQDSCs was examined by SEM (Fig. 5a). It is clearly seen that the IZO ETL layer has a thickness of ≈50 nm. The PbS CQD film layer including the PbS-EMII active layer with a thickness of approximately 400 nm and the PbS-EDT HTL (≈40 nm) are also presented. The performance of the IZO/ZnO CQDSC devices was evaluated with an active area of 0.16 cm2 based on the measurement scheme presented in Fig. 5b. 60 cells were designed and tested to ensure the reproducibility of the measurement results (Table S4†). Fig. 5c shows the current–voltage (J–V) curves of CQDSCs using IZO and ZnO as ETLs. It is clear that the IZO based CQDSC annealed at 150 °C possesses a superior photoelectric performance than the ZnO based CQDSC. The IZO-based device has a higher fill factor (FF) of 68%, a current density (JSC) of 25.8 mA cm−2, and an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.64 V, giving an overall PCE of 11.1%, compared to a PCE of 9.4% for the ZnO based device. The photoelectric properties (e.g., VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE) of ZnO and IZO prepared at various temperatures are also summarized in Table 1. Moreover, the PbS CQDSC device fabricated by annealing the IZO layer at 150 °C has the highest PCE, as compared to the devices annealed at 200 °C, 250 °C, and 300 °C (Table 1, and Fig. S5†). The decrease in the overall properties (VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE) with higher annealing temperature may arise from an increase in series resistance (RS) as well as in the shunt resistance (RSh).41 In addition, the rough morphology of IZO films at a higher temperature also leads to a decrease in the PCE because these are not well compacted and smooth films (Fig. 2e–h & Fig. S2†).42 The fact that the PbS CQDSC device fabricated by annealing the IZO layer at 150 °C has the highest PCE is also rightly consistent with the multiple advantages, e.g. bandgaps and transmittance. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the IZO and ZnO based PbS CQD solar cells within a wavelength range of 300–1100 nm are shown in Fig. 5d. The increase in the EQE in the blue-light region may be due to a favorable heterojunction band alignment of IZO/PbS-EMII and PbS-EMII/PbS-EDT, facilitating the efficient load separation and, consequently, system selection. The built-in EQE and AM1.5 G photocurrent spectra are in agreement with the JSC value. This newly developed ETL with PbS-EMII (light absorber layer), in CQDSCs results in a high PCE (11.1%), which is, certainly, still far behind the highest reported PCE (13.8%) in CQDSCs that is due to the implementation of a perovskite (FABr) monolayer.18 However, the advance in the present ZnO and IZO ETLs prepared by a simple solution-processed method at a low temperature would endow the relevant CQDSCs with potential.

To gain insight into the improved VOC and JSC in the representative unit, impedance spectroscopy (EIS), an essential method for understanding the knowledge about the CQDSC system interfaces,43,44 was also employed. Fig. 6 shows the impedance spectra (Nyquist plot Z′′ vs. Z′)of IZO and ZnO based CQDSC devices under dark and one-sun illumination conditions that were performed to determine the series resistance (RS) and recombination resistance (Rrec). Under dark conditions, only one semicircle is obtained for both ZnO and IZO ELTs, corresponding to their Rrec (Fig. 6a and b), while two semicircles are seen under the illumination conditions (Fig. 6c and d). Their series resistance (RS) and Rrec could be fitted using the equivalent model shown in Fig. 6d-inset, and correspond to the high-frequency and low-frequency region data. Fitting yields the Rrec and RS values at different applied biases for ZnO and IZO based PbS CQDSC devices, which are shown in Fig. 6e–h as a function of the applied bias. It is clear that the IZO based devices always show a higher value of Rrec and lower RS compared to the ZnO based devices. The lower RS values of the IZO ETL show the best charge carrier rate and the enhanced interface. On the other hand, the higher Rrec, that is, a higher charge carrier rate in the case of IZO based devices, confirms the higher VOC in these devices.

As it is closely associated with the photoelectric conversion, the charge dynamics was studied to better understand the impacts of IZO and ZnO on the PbS CQDSC devices. To achieve this, room-temperature photoluminescence (PL) was performed, as shown in Fig. 7. The charge extraction from the PbS layer by the IZO or ZnO ETL is thus assessed. Without the IZO or ZnO ETL, the PbS CQD film presents a typical and strong PL peak at around 1060 nm. However, the PL emissions of the PbS CQDs can be significantly constrained by using the IZO or ZnO ETL. Obviously, the utilization of the IZO ETL can maximally decrease the PL intensity to a relatively low level. Its lower intensity compared to that of ZnO shows a superior charge transfer property for the IZO ETL.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, the donors indium (In3+), aluminium (Al3+) and gallium (Ga3+) were chosen to incorporate into ZnO (IZO, AZO and GZO) as electron transport layers (ETL) with PbS-EMII as the active absorber layer in colloidal quantum dot solar cells (CQDSCs). Systematic UV-vis and UPS spectral investigations indicate that In3+ incorporation in ZnO (IZO) can effectively increase the bandgap the most (from 3.56 eV to 3.74 eV) and show the most suitable band alignment and charge transfer ability. Moreover, In3+ incorporation leads to an increase in visible-light transmission (up to 94%) and a decrease in the particle sizes and surface roughness. The PbS CQDs with a dispersed and uniform size of 3 nm were well controlled by a N2-protected flux method using 1-octadecene (ODE) as the reaction solvent, and oleic acid (OA) as the capping ligand, which were exchanged by using 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (EMII) and ethanedithiol (EDT). The PbS CQDSCs were precisely fabricated by a layer-by-layer process to achieve a device configuration of ITO/IZO/PbS-EMII/PbS-EDT/Au. The photoelectric characterization studies demonstrate that the IZO-based CQDSC device achieved a PCE of 11.1%, which is 18% higher than that of the ZnO-based CQDSCs, and also higher FF (68%), VOC (0.64 V), and JSC (25.8 mA cm−2), revealing a more effective energy system, more enduring light capacity, and a faster-charging characteristic for IZO-based CQDSCs. This newly developed IZO ETL with EMII capped PbS CQDs (active layer), which demonstrates a superior coupling capability, may pave a new path to produce high performance CQD photoelectric devices.
