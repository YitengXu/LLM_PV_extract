The ALD-Al2O3 thin film functions as a contact doping layer with MoS2 to control its electron distribution and Fermi level through intrinsic negative charges. It was found that the electron density and mobility of MoS2 both increased when Al2O3 was introduced. The Fermi level of the doped MoS2 upshifted toward its valence band, decreasing the work function to 3.92 eV and enlarging the MoS2/p-Si energy level splitting. After Al2O3 doping, the built-in field (Vbi) of the MoS2/p-Si junction enhanced significantly to 610 mV, and the diffusion mechanism dominates the carrier transport process here. Under the synergistic effects of surface passivation and n-type doping of Al2O3, the Vocs of MoS2/p-Si solar cells improved by ∼26%. Besides, the lower reflectivity in the Al2O3/MoS2 window layer leads to light absorption enhancement in a short wavelength and Jsc increasement in solar cells. Finally, we obtain an optimized bulk-like MoS2-based solar cell with a conversion efficiency of 5.02% (Voc 302.5 mV, Jsc 33.29 mA cm−2, and FF 49.88%) by energy band engineering. The depth-UPS analysis and C–V fitting results revealed the nature of improvement of MoS2/p-Si photovoltaic properties, where the electrons directionally transporting and accumulating in MoS2 under electric fields caused by Al2O3 mainly influence the energy band alignment and p–n junction behavior at the MoS2/Si interface.
1. Introduction
The emerging two-dimensional (2D) materials represented by graphene (Gr) and transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have been flourishing in the optoelectronic, photochemical, and photovoltaic fields due to their distinctive optical, electronic, and mechanical properties.1,2 Nowadays, the aggressive scale expansion of silicon-based solar cells has motivated the photovoltaic device community to explore alternative contact materials and device architectures for future industrial applications. In this context, the typical TMDC member molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has been extensively investigated by researchers; it is observed that it offers a tunable optical band gap (Eg 1.2–1.9 eV) and desirable optical–electrical characteristics (absorption coefficient 5 × 105 cm−1, room-temperature carrier mobility 200–350 cm2 V−1 s−1).3 Many more reports are devoted to the photovoltaic applications of MoS2 films as the passivating buffer or electrical-contact candidate in Si-based solar cells, which manifested excellent photovoltaic performance. In particular, a few reports on Gr/MoS2/Si type solar cells have described amazing power-conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 15.8% with chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown MoS2.4,5 By virtue of the tunable band structure and chemically inert 2D surface, the CVD-MoS2 can even perform well on other bulk semiconductors, e.g., GaAs, CH3NH3PbI3, InP, and so on. Despite the numerous achievements above, these few-layer MoS2 may not be well-suited for solar cell production at an industrial scale due to the extremely confined active area, unreliable repeatability and expensive manufacturing cost during the highly technical CVD process.6–8 To achieve device-level MoS2 synthetic techniques, magnetron sputtering and pulse laser deposition are introduced, which enable facile, scalable, and economical technical processes.9,10 The prepared MoS2 presents a bulk-like crystalline structure and exhibits more rapid charge collection along the perpendicular direction. The Eg of this bulk-like MoS2 is analogous to that of silicon (1.12 eV), making it more suitable for fabricating devices with a wide spectral response.11 However, the cell's performance is limited due to the unusual Fermi-level pinning at the metal/MoS2 interface and on the microcrystalline MoS2 grain surface. Furthermore, inherent lattice structure differences between 2D and 3D semiconductor materials would inevitably cause high-density defect states (mainly stress and dangling bonds) at their interface, detrimental to the photovoltaic properties.12 Control of the electronic recombination losses and concurrent improvement of the extraction of photogenerated charges at the MoS2/Si heterojunction interface have become essential for meeting the demands for MoS2 device functionality.
Previous solutions to such interfacial issues were primarily managed through passivating the undercoordinated atoms and dangling bonds and thus reducing the interfacial carrier recombination rate.13 The practical passivation scheme is required to be applicable and compatible to both Si-based and MoS2 manufacturing, like SiO2 buffer and Al2O3 dielectric layers.14,15 To our knowledge, the best-operating bulk-like MoS2-based solar cells were just fabricated using atomic layer-deposited (ALD) Al2O3-based passivation at the MoS2 surface.15 It is reported that the Al2O3 thin films feature distinctive field-effect passivation by negative fixed charges, except for the chemical passivation. The ALD-Al2O3 could even produce a conformal oxide layer on textured-Si, which is a high-k dielectric and acts as an electron blocking layer.16 Several research works have proven and elaborated the state-of-the-art level surface passivation of Al2O3 in Si-based solar cells.15,17 Beyond the passivation enhancement effect, the authors also put forward a point that Al2O3 could result in electrostatic doping on multilayer MoS2 and change the MoS2 film doping concentration, which could contribute to the improvement of Vbi and PCEs of solar cells but have not been studied extensively till now.15 In previous studies, the Al2O3 doping effect was also demonstrated on monolayer MoS2 using charge-transfer techniques.18 The concentration of electrons and holes at the semiconductor interface is altered by electrostatic shielding through an internal electric field presented by Al2O3 with a high density of built-in negative charges of up to ∼1013 elementary charges cm−2.19 The investigations on the complicated effect of Al2O3 passivation conducted so far are insufficient, and the origin of improvement of MoS2/Si photovoltaic properties needs to be additionally and insightfully clarified.
In this work, we adopted the ALD-Al2O3 film as the passivation-doping layer to study the electronic energy band modulation of magnetron sputtering MoS2 and its photovoltaic performance in Si-based heterojunction solar cells. The in-depth UPS combined with the Hall effect and capacitance–voltage measurement are implemented to get a deeper understanding of the fundamental influencing mechanism of Al2O3 insertion on MoS2/Si photovoltaic properties. The Al2O3 doping process here represents a viable technique to improve the carrier transportation efficiency and device photovoltaic characteristics by aligning the interface energy band, which lays a foundation for the interfacial modification and device configuration design of other TMDC materials in hetero-structured photovoltaic devices.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Raw materials
Sputtering MoS2 thin films are generally a bulk-like material, which was deposited in a direct-current (DC) magnetron sputtering system. The sputtering target is a 2.36-inch diameter, cold-pressed MoS2 (99.99% pure) target with a substrate-to-target distance of ∼85 mm. The sputtering process of the MoS2 films was carried out in a 99.99% high-purity argon–hydrogen mixture (Ar + 10%H2) atmosphere, whose gas flow rate was modulated by mass-flow controllers. The specific deposition parameters are shown in Table 1. The Al2O3 thin films were prepared using atomic layer deposition (ALD) technology in a LabNano 9100/9200/9300 ALD reaction chamber with the substrate temperature maintained at 250 °C. During the deposition process, trimethylaluminum (TMB) and deionized water were selected as the aluminum source and oxygen source, respectively, and the Al2O3 film growth rate was ∼1.1 Å per cycle. For the analysis of MoS2 film properties before and after Al2O3 modulation doping, the as-deposited and doping MoS2 thin films were prepared on quartz (SiO2), crystalline silicon (c-Si) and SiO2-buffered silicon (SiO2/Si) substrates.

2.2. Sample preparation
The device configuration of MoS2/p-Si heterojunction solar cells is depicted in Fig. 1. Double-side polished p-type Czochralski c-Si wafer (500 μm thick, 〈100〉 oriented, 1–10 Ω cm) was used as a substrate. Prior to deposition, the c-Si wafers were chemically cleaned via a 10% HF solution to remove the natural oxide from the silicon surface. Right after that, a thin SiOx layer was formed on both sides in 68 wt% HNO3 acid at 110 °C for 10 min, thus ensuring a superior surface passivation quality for c-Si substrates. Then, the MoS2 films (10 nm in thickness, unless otherwise stated) were immediately grown on the surface of this thin chemical oxide layer, and the MoS2/Si p–n junction was successfully prepared. Subsequently, the ALD-Al2O3 doping layer (var.) was deposited on top of the MoS2 layer. In order to lower the effective surface recombination velocity on the backside of the devices, a 50 nm heavily boron-doped μc-SiOx:H layer, acting as the back surface field (BSF), was introduced by means of plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). The front- and rear-metal contacts used in the MoS2/p-Si devices were 700 nm Ag fingered grids and Ag full area back contact, respectively. Before the Ag electrode preparation, a 70 nm ITO transparent conductive electrode was deposited on both sides of the solar cells via sputtering to enhance the carrier lateral transportation and collection efficiency. The details of the deposition process parameters and the fabrication specifications of the MoS2/p-Si heterojunction devices can be referred to in the work of Zhang et al.20

2.3. Characterization
To identify the effect of Al2O3 doping on the electronic properties of the MoS2 films, we investigated the Raman spectra of the as-deposited and doping MoS2 samples recorded using Jobin-YvonHR800 Raman spectroscopy on SiO2/Si substrates (with an incident wavelength of 532 nm). For the crystal orientation characteristics of the MoS2 films, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrum was collected on silicon substrates using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer (with the Cu Kα radiation of 1.5406 Å). The bulk-like MoS2 crystal morphology was observed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEINova NanoSE M450) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, FEI, Tecnai G2). The elemental composition and chemical binding of the MoS2 samples on c-Si substrates were determined via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and their energy band structure characterization was performed via ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), both of which were conducted on a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi photoelectron spectrograph. Before the data collection, all the films were sputter-cleaned to remove atmospheric contamination in the XPS chamber for approximately 30 s, with the lower energy of Ar+ operated at 2–3 keV. The vacuum pressure of the analysis chamber was better than 2 × 10−8 Pa. For XPS, survey scans to identify the overall surface composition and chemical states were performed using a monochromated Al Kα X-ray source (¼1486.68 eV), detecting photoelectrons at a 100 eV pass energy and a channel width of 1 eV. High-resolution scans to identify the bonding states were performed at a 20 eV pass energy and a 10 meV channel width. The surface carbon signal at 284.8 eV was used as an internal standard. UPS was carried out using He I radiation at 21.22 eV from a discharge lamp operated at 25 W, a pass energy of 1 eV, and a channel width of 100 meV. A −10 V bias was applied to the samples in order to separate the sample and analyzer low-kinetic-energy cutoffs. The electrical properties of the MoS2 samples (1 × 1 cm2) on SiO2 substrates were evaluated using an ET9007 Hall effect measurement system with the four-point contact configuration at room temperature. The optical absorption spectra of the single MoS2 films were collected with an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (UV-Vis, Hitachi UV-4100) in the range of 300–1200 nm, and the optical parameters of the Al2O3/MoS2 stacks were obtained via HORIBA Jobin-Yvon spectroscopic ellipsometry. In order to analyze the photovoltaic performance of the fabricated MoS2/p-Si heterojunction devices with Al2O3 doping, the current density–voltage (J–V) measurement was implemented using a semiconductor parameter analyzer (Agilent B1500-A) under an AM 1.5 solar simulator and in the dark at 25 °C. Additionally, the capacitance–voltage (C–V) curves were also acquired using an Agilent B1500-A setup. The systematic spectral response, i.e., external quantum efficiency (EQE), of the MoS2/p-Si devices was measured in the wavelength range of 350–1100 nm by employing a CrownTech 1000ADX QE setup.
3. Results and discussion
The fundamental properties of the bulk-like MoS2 films are presented in Fig. 2. As shown in the SEM and HRTEM images in Fig. 2(a) and (b), there are visible MoS2 crystal domains unevenly embedded in the MoS2 matrix. It can be obscurely seen that the loosely packed small clusters (marked by red dotted circles) appear in the 10 nm bulk MoS2, surrounded by the original amorphous precursor. These clusters are some ordered regions with a layered crystal structure and intensively distribute on the surface of the amorphous MoS2 matrix, indicating the slight crystallization of the MoS2 films.

(d) The XRD diffraction pattern of the MoS2 film covered with different thicknesses of the Al2O3 layer. 
To identify the crystal structure variation of MoS2 films after Al2O3 doping, the typical XRD pattern of the 10 nm MoS2 films on Si substrates is presented in Fig. 2(d). A single diffraction peak centered at 13.5° is mainly indexed to the (002) crystal orientation of the hexagonal molybdenite structure with its crystal plane parallel to the basal plane.21 This preferred-orientation growth mechanism in 10 nm bulk-like MoS2 films is caused by the higher energetic ion bombardment of conventional DC sputtering, which promotes the growth of (002)-oriented MoS2 by creating high-energy sites for atom adsorption.21 As the Al2O3 layer thickness increases, the intensity of this typical diffraction peak improves first and then slightly drops, suggesting a better MoS2 crystallization quality with appropriate Al2O3 decoration. The relatively broader diffraction peaks here imply the matrix structure of MoS2 existing in an amorphous form.
The optical properties of the as-deposited MoS2 films on quartz substrates were studied by optical absorption analysis. Fig. 2(e) illustrates the absorption spectra of the MoS2 thin film. Its optical bandgap Eg can be calculated according to the Tauc formula22 to be 1.37 eV, indicating a pristine bulk-like MoS2 in this work.23 Besides, the absorption coefficient (α) of the MoS2 sample is greater than 1 × 105 cm−1 when the photon energy exceeds 2.3 eV. This suggests that the pristine MoS2 film has strong incident light absorption ability in the ultraviolet and visible light range.
The chemical characteristic changes of the MoS2 films before and after Al2O3 contact doping were studied using the XPS measurements on c-Si substrates and are exhibited in Fig. 3. The XPS spectra have been fitted by Gaussian–Lorentzian curves corresponding to Mo 3d peaks, and the relative contents of the various valence states of Mo are estimated from the cover of the Gaussian curves, as summarized in Table 2. From the fitting results of MoS2 without doping, the XPS spectra show three main spin–orbit doublets, in which a dominant Mo 3d doublet with peaks at 229.4 eV and 232.6 eV corresponds to the Mo4+ 3d5/2 and Mo4+ 3d3/2.24,25 The obvious S 2s peak at 226.6 eV suggests the formation of bulk-like MoS2 by magnetron sputtering, and the Mo4+ peaks here belonging to MoS2, with the S 2p doublet at 162.0 eV and 163.1 eV.24 At a higher binding energy, a weaker but wider Mo 3d doublet is also observed at 229.8 eV and 233.2 eV, associated with Mo cations in the higher oxidation state (Mo5+). This is related to the appearance and formation of oxygen vacancies (Ov) in the MoS2 film.24,25 The study of density functional theory has indicated that MoS2 is highly susceptible to oxidation by oxygen atoms, so it could be inferred that the Mo4+ there in MoS2 was partially oxidized into higher valence state cations Mo5+.26 These cations occupy the defective states within the MoS2 band gap and act as like-accepter defects, pushing the MoS2 Fermi level to its valence band edge.27,28 From the fitting results in Table 2, the relative content of Mo5+ reaches up to 30.44%, indicating that the Ovs should be the major defects in as-grown MoS2 films. Moreover, there occurs an even smaller Mo 3d doublet at much higher binding energies (232.1 eV and 235.9 eV) with a spin–orbit splitting of 3.8 eV, which corresponds to the Mo6+ species characteristic of stoichiometric MoO3, a stable molybdenum oxide.24,25 For 0.5 nm Al2O3/MoS2 samples, the S 2s peak shifts ca. 0.3 eV to lower binding energy, and the peak intensities of the Mo4+ 3d doublet (229.3 eV, 232.6 eV) and the Mo6+ 3d doublet (232.2 eV, 235.7 eV) both obviously improve. The intensities of Mo5+ 3d5/2 and Mo5+ 3d3/2 decrease, and the corresponding Mo5+ relative content reduces to 14.72%. This result indicates that the chemical passivation effect of Al2O3 effectively modified the O vacancies.19 As the Al2O3 thickness increases, the Mo5+ content in MoS2 shows a progressively descending trend and obtains its minimum of 14.19% in the 1 nm Al2O3/MoS2 sample. Besides, the Mo4+ content also decreases with increasing Al2O3 thickness, indicating that even Mo4+ in the MoS2 films may be oxidized to Mo2O5 and MoO3 by the oxygen atom from the Al2O3 capping layer. The Mo4+ 3d5/2 and Mo4+ 3d3/2 doublets here shift to lower binding energies (0.5 nm: 229.3 eV, 232.6 eV; 1 nm: 229.2 eV, 232.7 eV), suggesting the decreasing MoS2 stoichiometry.29 After the Al2O3 thickness exceeds 1.5 nm, the S 2s peak shifts to 226.1 eV and the relative content of Mo4+ and Mo5+ inversely increases, which is likely related to the reduction reaction of Mo6+ with electron injection in MoS2 (demonstrated later).

To confirm the doping effect of the Al2O3 layer, we investigated the electronic and vibrational properties of the MoS2 samples on SiO2/Si substrates by Raman spectroscopy.
As shown in Fig. 4, there were two main Raman characteristic peaks in all samples, corresponding to E12g (in-plane vibration) and A1g (out-of-plane vibration) modes.30,31 The original Raman spectrum of MoS2 before doping presents lateral E12g and vertical A1g vibration modes around 380 and 412 cm−1, respectively. The frequency difference between these two prominent peaks is around 32 cm−1, typically correlated with the formation of few-layer MoS2 with high crystalline quality.30,32 After being doped with Al2O3, the E12g peak position of MoS2 films remains essentially constant, while the A1g peak shows a downshift trend and becomes more and more distinct as the Al2O3 thickness increases. This phenomenon can be explained by the changes in the electronic distribution of MoS2; that is, the electron–phonon coupling of the A1g modes suggested to be stronger than that of the E12g modes.28,33,34 The A1g vibrations are more susceptible to the electron concentrations than the E12g modes, and the red shift of the A1g vibrations in Raman spectrums results from the electron injection effect.35,36 These spectroscopic observations demonstrate the change of doping level in MoS2, i.e., the increasing electron density and then the rising Fermi level in the energy space,27,35,36 which is consistent with what was reported on the n-type doping of MoS2.27,36,37 Except for the peak position variation, the integrated intensities of both E12g and A1g peaks obviously increase when the Al2O3 thickness is less than 2 nm, likely relative to the improved crystallinity in MoS2 samples by the Al2O3 passivation effect.30,35
 Fig. 4  Raman scattering spectrum of MoS2 films capped with different thicknesses of the Al2O3 passivation layer on the SiO2/Si substrate. 
We adopted the Hall effect measurements to quantitatively analyze the influence of Al2O3 doping on the carrier density and mobility of the MoS2 films. Clearly, the pure MoS2 thin film here manifested n-type behavior, and its electron concentration and mobility are 9.82 × 1014 cm−3 and 182 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. This is consistent with the results reported in previous literature.38,39 According to the Hall measurement results, the MoS2 film still exhibits n-type conductivity with a resistivity of 8.36–11.1 Ω cm after coating with an Al2O3 overlayer. The relatively lower resistivity in doped MoS2 films can be attributed to the reducing defect recombination by the chemical passivation effect of Al2O3. In the Al2O3/MoS2 samples, the electron concentration increases with the increasing Al2O3 thickness (from 4.5 × 1014 to 3.59 × 1015 cm−3). The extracted electron mobility is actually declining, especially in thicker Al2O3/MoS2 stacks. The relatively higher carrier density enhances the electrons scattering effect and thus contributes to the decreasing charge carrier mobility in these Al2O3/MoS2 samples (Table 3).40

The energy level evolution of MoS2 films with Al2O3 doping was further elaborated using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). Since the detection depth in this measurement is extremely thin (∼3 nm), a series of MoS2/Al2O3/MoS2 stacking structures were designed on c-Si substrates. The full UPS information of the as-deposited MoS2 sample (pristine MoS2) and the doping MoS2 samples (x-nm Al2O3) is shown in Fig. 5(a).
 Fig. 5  (a) UPS full spectrum of 10 nm pre-deposited MoS2 thin film samples (pristine MoS2) and a series of MoS2/Al2O3(var.)/MoS2 samples on a c-Si substrate, where the Al2O3 thickness is variable; (b) the valence band region and (c) the secondary electron cut-off edge of the UPS spectrum of all the samples are used to derive their work function WF. 
For the MoS2 samples, the UPS spectra are roughly consistent before and after doping, but there arises an upshift at higher binding energy (ca. 16 eV) after doping with Al2O3, indicating a Fermi level shifting in MoS2.25,41 To deeply analyze the band features of these samples, we focused on the valence band and secondary-electron cutoff regions of the UPS spectra, respectively. From the expanded valence spectra in Fig. 5(b), the Fermi level EF of the MoS2/Al2O3/MoS2 sample moves away from its valence band minimum (VBM) gradient as the Al2O3 thickness increases. We derive the (EF-VBM) and work function (WF) values of all the MoS2/Al2O3/MoS2 samples by fitting the valence band area and secondary electron cut-off area, respectively, and the deduced results are listed in Table 4. As can be seen, the WF value of pristine MoS2 is 4.28 eV, with the (EF-VBM) around 0.96 eV. According to the earlier discussion about the optical bandgap of MoS2 in Fig. 2, this result indicates that the sputtering bulk-like MoS2 film in this work is an n-type conductive semiconductor. In terms of the Al2O3 capping, the (EF-VBM) value increases from 0.96 eV for pristine MoS2 to 1.16 eV for doping MoS2 and continuously rises with the Al2O3 thickness. Correspondingly, the WF values of the doping MoS2 gradually decrease, demonstrating that the n-type doping is successfully implemented into the MoS2 films under the effect of field-induced passivation of Al2O3 (considering the optical band gap of 1.37 eV in bulk-like MoS2 here).37

To explore the influence of Al2O3 doping effect on the electric field variation of the MoS2/p-Si interface, we measured and analyzed the capacitance–voltage (C–V) characteristics of the Al2O3/MoS2/p-Si heterojunction. According to the measured C–V in the reverse voltage range, the C−2 versus voltage curves of the MoS2/p-Si heterojunction are depicted in Fig. 6. The capacitance can be expressed as 
C−2 = 2(Vbi − V)/qNcKsε0A2
(1)where q is the electron charge, Nc is the carrier density, Ks is the semiconductor dielectric constant, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, A is the surface area of a solar cell and Vbi is the built-in potential.42 Based on the equation, the Vbis of the MoS2/p-Si solar cells can be deduced by the intercept on the voltage axis of the C−2–V curve. From the extracted results in Table 5, the Vbi value of the MoS2/p-Si heterojunction without doping was about 559.48 mV, while the Vbis of the doped MoS2/p-Si heterojunction increased and a maximum of 610.52 mV was obtained at 1.5 nm, indicating the formation of an excellent p–n junction in Al2O3-doping MoS2/p-Si solar cells.43 Additionally, it could be inferred from the schematic illustration in Fig. 6 that the built-in field points from the MoS2 film to the p-type Si substrate.44 The slight decrease of the Vbi value in 0.5 nm Al2O3/MoS2/p-Si devices may be the result of increased local stress and the composite increase of interface defects caused by the uneven coverage of the Al2O3 layer. The larger Vbi is conducive to the improvement of the solar cell Vocs.

The photovoltaic properties of the MoS2/p-Si solar cells after Al2O3 introduction were studied using the current density–voltage (J–V) response, and their resulting J–V curves in the dark and under illumination by 100 mW cm−2 light source are displayed in Fig. 7. It can be seen that the photovoltaic characteristics of the MoS2/p-Si solar cells are improved by inserting Al2O3 doping layers. For pure MoS2/p-Si solar cells without doping modulation, the corresponding electrical parameters are an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 240.7 mV, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 32.296 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 50.41%, with a power conversion efficiency of 3.93%. When the Al2O3 thickness increases, the Voc improves obviously from 287.5 mV (1 nm Al2O3/MoS2/p-Si device) to 302.5 mV (1.5 nm Al2O3/MoS2/p-Si device) and gradually stabilizes at ∼300 mV, as shown in Fig. 7(b). It is reported that the Voc is primarily related to two factors, namely, carrier recombination and energy level splitting at the p–n junction interface.20,45 This result is mainly due to the dual passivation effects from the Al2O3 layer. On the one hand, the Al2O3 chemical passivation effectively saturates the Ov values distributed in MoS2 and thus reduces the defect recombination losses (demonstrated in Fig. 3). On the other hand, the field effect passivation from the fixed negative charges in Al2O3 changes the electronic properties of the MoS2 layer, and its energy band structure correspondingly rearranges (the main factor is discussed in detail later). As shown in Fig. 7(c), the Jsc values increase by ∼3% in MoS2/p-Si devices greater than 1 nm, which is mainly owing to the Al2O3 anti-reflection effect verified that followed. Compared to the pure MoS2/p-Si devices, the FFs of MoS2/p-Si devices with Al2O3 doping are uniformly reduced, attributing to the newly introduced interface and poor conductivity of Al2O3. The slightly lower FF in 1 nm Al2O3/MoS2/p-Si device is mainly attributed to the smaller Mo4+ content in MoS2 with a lower carrier mobility (357.87 cm2 V−1 s−1) and a higher resistivity (10.76 Ω cm), and its sharp drop in the 2 nm device results from the carrier blocking effect caused by the poorly conductive thicker Al2O3 layer. As is well known, the carrier transport mechanism in metal oxides, like Al2O3, is tunneling transport, and thus, the Al2O3 thickness would seriously affect the charge transportation and collection efficiency.46

By replotting the dark J–V curve of the MoS2/p-Si heterojunction solar cells using the semi-logarithmic system in Fig. 8, the carrier transport mechanism at the MoS2/Si heterojunction with Al2O3 doping was clarified. As can be seen in Fig. 8(a), all of the samples present obvious rectifying behavior, indicating the sure formation of the Schottky junction at the MoS2/Si hetero-interface.44 Among the samples with contact doping, the rectifying ratio (I+1/I−1) of the MoS2/Si heterojunction at d = 1.5 nm obtains a maximum of 6.77 × 104. This implies that the excellent diode is formed in the solar cells with 1.5 nm Al2O3 passivation, thanks to the higher Vbi and lower defect recombination at the MoS2/Si interface here.44

Fig. 8(b) exhibits the double-logarithmic dark J–V characteristics of these MoS2/n-Si heterojunction solar cells in the forward bias voltage region. As can be seen, with the bias voltage increasing from 0 to 1 V, there are three obviously linear regions with different JV-slopes on the dark J–V curves, corresponding to different dominating carrier transport mechanisms in different bias voltage regions.43 In the bias voltage at the intermediate range (region II; 0.1–0.3 V), the dominating electrical transporting process is determined by the diffusion-limited mechanism or the recombination-limited mechanism. The ideality (n) of the devices was extracted by fitting the dark J–V curve here with the following diode equation: 
J = J0[exp(qV/nKT) − 1]
(2)where J0 and n respectively represent the reverse saturation current and the ideality factor.43 According to the fitting results summarized in Table 6, the ideality of the MoS2/p-Si photovoltaic devices without doping is 1.139, and the corresponding J0 is 5.338 × 10−6 A cm−2. In MoS2/Al2O3/p-Si devices, J0 gradually decreases with increasing Al2O3 thickness, underlining the passivation effect of Al2O3. It is reported in the Sah–Noyce–Shockley theory that the diode ideality factors for the diffusion current in the neutral regions and the recombination at the space-charge regions (SCR) are n = 1 and n ≤ 2, respectively.43,47 Therefore, it can be inferred that the dominating carrier transporting here in MoS2/p-Si and MoS2/Al2O3/p-Si devices should be a diffusion-controlled process.43

For further understanding the complete gain of Jsc in all the samples with Al2O3 doping, we characterize the photo-response of the MoS2/Si heterojunction solar cells by the external quantum efficiency (EQE), which is illustrated in Fig. 9. It should be mentioned that the EQE values of the devices in this work are in accordance with their Jsc results in Fig. 7. Fig. 9(a) shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and (I − R) curves of Al2O3/MoS2/p-Si heterojunction solar cells with different thicknesses, where R is their reflectance spectrum. As the Al2O3 thickness increases, the devices’ EQEs present different variation trends in different wavelength ranges. However, the reflectance curves experience a slight increment at first and then an obvious dropping, in accordance with the changing regular of the reflectivity of Al2O3/MoS2 samples in Fig. S1 (ESI†). In the short wavelength range (<650 nm), the incident photons are mainly absorbed by the emitter regions (namely, the MoS2 layer) in the solar cells, so the EQE here strongly points to the carrier recombination and transportation at the MoS2/Si interface. Due to the extremely high light absorption coefficient of the MoS2 film (∼5 × 105 cm−1), we can deduce that the intensity of the S-band light trapped by the Al2O3/MoS2 layer is considerable.48 In the wavelength range of 300–700 nm, the EQE increases first to its maximum at 1.5 nm and then declines, mainly affected by the microstructure and optical properties of Al2O3/MoS2 composite films. From the comprehensive analysis before, the increasement of Al2O3 thickness results in the reduction of oxygen vacancies in MoS2 films (Fig. 3) and the improvement of MoS2 crystallinity (Fig. 2) and Al2O3/MoS2 transmittance (Fig. S1, ESI†), thus contributing to the promotion of EQE. The subsequent attenuation of the EQE mainly attributes to the degenerating microstructure and optical properties of the Al2O3/MoS2 film lamination. In the long wavelength range (650–950 nm), since most of the lower-energy photons are converted into photo-generated carriers in the p-Si absorber, the photo-generated electron transportation at the hetero-interface is the limiting factor for photo-response of the solar cells. The EQE originally decreases but gradually increases and stabilizes in the range of 700–1100 nm. The former possibly originates from the uneven covering of Al2O3 at the MoS2/Si interface, and the latter is owing to the higher Vbi with Al2O3 contact doping.

To gain insight into the cells’ inner photo-response, the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) curves of the Al2O3/MoS2/p-Si solar cells were determined by the formula49 
IQE(λ) = EQE(λ)/[1 − R(λ)]
(3)As can be seen in Fig. 9(b), there is a remarkable boost of IQE in the short-medium wavelength range. In accordance with the optical-property results in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the refractive index (n) of Al2O3/MoS2 lamination gradually decreases with Al2O3 thickness, thus leading to the increasement of the R spectrum with the cell window layer (Fig. 9(a)). Therefore, this significant improvement of the IQE response is mainly due to the antireflection effect of the Al2O3 layer.50
In order to address the underlying Al2O3 doping mechanism here, a set of UPS spectrums was obtained by the depth profiling measurement for the MoS2 films doped with a 2 nm Al2O3 layer and is shown in Fig. 10(a). In addition, the schematic energy level structure is drawn in Fig. 10(b) and (c) to insightfully understand the electronic behavior in MoS2 with contact doping. In Fig. 10(b), we position the conduction band edge (Ec) and the valence band edge (Ev) of the as-grown MoS2 at ∼−4.1 eV and ∼−5.5 eV, respectively, depending on the UPS results in Fig. 5. From the energy level of isolated MoS2 and Al2O3, the EF of Al2O3 is located above the Ec of MoS2. The C–V analysis in Fig. S2 (ESI†) has proven the presence of negative fixed charges in this ALD-deposited Al2O3 layer. Vfb denotes the structure flat-band voltage, representing the conductive type of charges in the dielectric layer.51 Here, the positive Vfbs are indicative of the negative charges in the Al2O3 layer. These fixed negative charges are mainly derived from Al vacancies (VAl) and oxygen interstitial (Oi) defects in Al2O3 films, whose energy level is located in the band gap of Al2O3 and close to the edge of its valence band.51,52 When Al2O3 was in contact with MoS2, an electric field was formed at the contact interface with the field direction from MoS2 to Al2O3, and then the carrier behavior in MoS2 would be affected by this electric field. The holes in MoS2 move directionally to the Al2O3/MoS2 interface forced by the electrostatic Coulomb effect and are bonded near the interface, while the electrons are shielded and repelled towards the c-Si substrates by the fixed negative charges. This process can be regarded as the electron extraction from the Al2O3/MoS2 interface and injection into the MoS2 surface. As a result, electron accumulation occurs on the MoS2 surface, which directly causes the EF upshifting on the MoS2 surface.27,45 For the 1.5 nm Al2O3 passivated MoS2 sample here, the EF moved 0.59 eV to its conduction band edge (CBM), as inferred from the (EF-VBM) variation in Fig. 5. Correspondingly, the work function WF of MoS2 can be adjusted to a minimum of 3.92 eV (decreased by 0.36 eV compared to pristine MoS2). According to the measuring result of in-depth UPS in Fig. 10(a), the consequent WF at the surface of doping MoS2 is around 4.0 eV, in good agreement with the results in Fig. 5. When under illumination (Fig. 10(b)), this promises larger Fermi level splitting at the MoS2/p-Si hetero-interface (WF of p-type c-Si around 5.15 eV), which brings about a stronger Vbi and an even higher Voc of the solar cells and thus facilitates the separation of photo-generated electron–hole pairs and extracting the charged carriers more quickly. With the etching time increasing further, the secondary electron cut-off edge shifts towards the lower binding energy, and the corresponding WF in MoS2 gradually increases and comes to the maximum of 4.50 eV after a 90 s etching process. All these confirmed the unique charge-transfer phenomenon in 2D MoS2 with ALD-Al2O3 doping.

4. Conclusion
In summary, we introduced an ALD-Al2O3 overlayer to conduct n-type doping for MoS2 films and the MoS2 Fermi-level modulation was achieved by the charge-transfer process under the electrostatic fielding effect. Our results demonstrated that by capping with a moderate Al2O3 layer, the MoS2 electronic properties (i.e., electron concentration and distribution) change. Meanwhile, the MoS2 Fermi level shifts towards its CBM with corresponding WF drops from 4.28 eV to ∼4.0 eV, resulting in enhanced Fermi energy splitting at the MoS2/p-Si interface. According to the depth-UPS analysis, this efficient doping mechanism is attributed to the electron contact transfer from inner MoS2 to its surface through the electrostatic repelling by the negative charges in Al2O3. The additional chemical passivation from the Al2O3 layer by reducing the Mo5+-related Ov defects in MoS2 minimizes the recombination losses near the MoS2/Si interface. These two effects contribute together to the increment of Vbi of the MoS2/Si heterojunction over 600 mV, and the device Voc improves well. The lower reflectivity in the device window layer enhances the light absorption and accelerates the carrier transporting at the MoS2/Si interface, thanks to Al2O3 insertion, which leads to the increase of Jsc to 33.29 mA cm−2. The authors discuss how the unique features of ALD-Al2O3 can be exploited for 2D-material energy-structure engineering and tailoring, while also providing innovation to energy level modulation for electronic devices.
