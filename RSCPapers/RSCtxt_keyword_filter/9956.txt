    , Accepted 18th February 2021First published on 19th February 2021AbstractThiacalixarenes are intriguing ligands that have attracted sustained interest because of their changeable conformations and excellent coordination ability. Thiacalix[4]arene analogues, which can bind metal ions to form modular second building units, are capable of constructing molecular-based functional materials with defined structures and various applications via directional coordination assembly. Due to rich metal–sulfur bonds, thiacalix[4]arene-based molecular clusters also exhibit diverse properties compared to other clusters. In particular, the combination of thiacalixarenes with currently popular molecular architectures, such as high-nuclearity clusters and coordination cages, has shown special catalytic performances. In this perspective, the latest advances in catalytic applications of thiacalix[4]arene-based molecular clusters, including molecular clusters themselves as catalysts and coordination cages serving as reaction vessels encapsulating metal nano-components for catalysis, are highlighted.
Introduction
Coordination-driven self-assembly has emerged as a popular strategy for constructing molecular architectures via the spontaneous organization of metal ions/clusters and organic ligands.1–5 Although the last decades have witnessed the blossom of engineering of molecular architectures,6–20 the design of chemical systems of increasing complexity and targeted functions still requires the development of novel synthesis tools for expanding the diversity of species with distinct properties.
Calixarenes, macrocyclic ligands with methylene/heteroatom-bridging phenolic groups, have been widely used for constructing molecular architectures.21–30 Thiacalix[4]arenes (including their oxidative derivatives)31,32 are tetramers of phenols joined by sulfur atoms or sulfinyl/sulfonyl groups and have been documented as a family of popular ligands for the construction of molecular clusters or coordination cages with desired structures and extraordinary properties.33–40 Thiacalix[4]arenes function as multidentate ligands due to the following two unique properties. On the one hand, a deprotonated thiacalix[4]arene in a cone conformation coordinates with divalent metal ions to form a shuttlecock-like Mx-thiacalix[4]arene (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, etc.; x is mostly 3 or 4) second building unit (SBU) (Scheme 1). In the Mx-thiacalix[4]arene SBU, the coordination of each metal ion features two adjacent phenoxide oxygen atoms, the in-between bridging sulfur (or oxygen from sulfinyl/sulfonyl) atom in a facial arrangement, and a Cl-, OH- or H2O located at the vertex position of a square pyramid formed with the metal ions. The Mx-thiacalix[4]arene SBUs are connected by auxiliary ligands to afford discrete molecular clusters, coordination cages and extended networks via a modular approach.41–55 In addition, thiacalix[4]arenes are emerging as new protecting ligands to build labile metal clusters, especially silver- and titanium-based clusters, in water media or under ambient conditions.56–61 On the other hand, the linkage through the coordination bond between metal atoms and bridging sulfur atoms (M–S bonds), such as Ag–S, Ti–S, Cd–S, Mo–S, and Cu–S in thiacalix[4]arene-supported molecular clusters provides a promising platform for developing potential catalysts.56–65 In light of these distinctive characters, chemists have sought to integrate thiacalix[4]arenes as structural elements for the construction of functional molecular assemblies that can meet applications in gas absorption and separation,49,52–55 drug delivery,50 catalysis,63–78 host–guest chemistry,79–82 supercapacitors,83 and Li-ion batteries.84

In this context, the rational design and syntheses of thiacalix[4]arene-based molecular clusters may open a new avenue for the generation of functional materials. Recently, it has not been surprising to witness the significant progress of thiacalix[4]arene-based molecular architectures. At present, some critical reviews on the progress of thiacalix[4]arene-based materials have been published;26,33–36 however, there is no review exclusively focusing on the application of thiacalix[4]arene-based molecular clusters for catalysis. Towards the future development of thiacalix[4]arene-based materials in catalysis, and some important progress having been made in this field, this perspective presents an overview of recent advances in catalytic applications over thiacalix[4]arene-supported architectures. The content of this perspective includes the following two aspects: (1) thiacalixarene-supported molecular clusters serve as catalysts through integrating multiple active sites or abundant M–S bonds; and (2) thiacalixarene-based coordination cages are applied in catalysis via their confined cavities, embedded catalytic components (active metal nodes or functional auxiliary ligands), or encapsulating cocatalysts (such as metal nanoparticles/nanoclusters or transition-metal catalysts). Accordingly, specific examples are selected to elucidate the related issues and shed light on designing molecular architectures with catalytic ability.
Thiacalix[4]arene-supported molecular clusters themselves as catalysts
Thiacalix[4]arene-based metal clusters could serve as catalysts because of their distinctive components and structures. Firstly, the capping of calixarene sheets could provide light absorption entities, which are crucial to photocatalysis, and the calixarene conformation profoundly affected the photocatalytic performances. Secondly, the Mx-thiacalix[4]arene subunits bond to fewer auxiliary ligands with more weakly coordinated molecules either by ligand symmetry or coordination hindrance modulation. The release of the weakly coordinated molecules could add the active metal sites. Thirdly, the thiacalixarene-supported metal clusters could be designed to incorporate additional site-substituted metal ions. Lastly, the unique coordination of metal ions and sulfur atoms is favourable for the assembly of catalysts. For example, the generation of Cd–S63 and Ti–S59–61 bonds could improve the photocatalytic activities of thiacalixarene-supported metal clusters. In addition, the clusters involving Mo–S64,65 bonds showed promising electrocatalytic abilities.
Photocatalysis
In 2018, Bi and co-workers synthesized a high-nuclearity Cd24 cluster by the assembly of Cd4-TC4A (H4TC4A = p-tert-butylthiacalix[4]arene SBUs) and in situ generated peroxy(mono)phosphate PO53− and peroxyphenoxide groups of TC4A (Fig. 1a).63 Because of the outer sheet of TC4A ligands and the incorporation of both peroxyphosphate and peroxide groups, which increased the coordination numbers of Cd atoms to generate more labile Cd–O/S bonds, the highest nuclearity Cd,S-co-rich Cd24 cluster showed enhanced photocatalytic water splitting activity compared with sandwich-like Cd4(TC4A)2 (Cd4) under the same reaction conditions without a cocatalyst. For example, photocatalytic investigations indicated that the hydrogen evolution values for Cd24 and Cd4 were 47.75 and 9.57 μmol (Fig. 1b), with the corresponding hydrogen evolution rates being 1.36 and 0.35 mmol gCdS−1 h−1, respectively. More importantly, the cycling performance of these two active catalysts for hydrogen production under irradiation for five consecutive cycles showed no significant decay, demonstrating the high stability during photocatalytic water splitting (Fig. 1c).

Very recently, the same group developed two TC4A-decorated polyoxo-titanium tetranuclear (Ti4) and hexanuclear (Ti6) clusters. Single-crystal structure analysis revealed that the ligand TC4A adopts a 1,2-alternate conformation in Ti4, while features a cone conformation in Ti6 (Fig. 2a). The authors found that both Ti4 and Ti6 show UV–vis absorption extending to 600 nm with band gaps at 2.19 eV (Ti4) and 2.24 eV (Ti6), respectively (Fig. 2b). Inspired by the excellent absorption properties of the clusters, they performed visible-light-driven water splitting on Ti4 and Ti6 by employing 10% TEOAs as the sacrificial electron donor. The hydrogen production catalysed by Ti4 is found to be 73.56 μmol g−1 h−1, which is an almost 4-fold increase from that with the Ti6 cluster (15.16 μmol g−1 h−1) (Fig. 2c). The authors further revealed that the different photocatalytic activities of the two clusters were attributed to the different Ti–S coordination modes stemming from the conformational disparity of TC4A ligands by density functional theory calculations.59 This example provides insight into further development of photocatalysts for efficient water splitting by thiacalix[4]arene modification.

Xiong and co-workers reported two similar TC4A-protected titanium-based clusters (Ti2Na4 and Ti6). Ti2Na4 features a dumbbell-like structure in which an octahedral Ti2Na4 core is shielded by two TC4A ligands with a cone conformation. Ti6 is composed of a bi-titanium unit and a TC4A molecule in a 1,2-alternate conformation. They revealed that both clusters exhibited semiconductor behaviour with bandgaps of 2.87 eV for Ti2Na4 and 1.97 eV for Ti6, showing highly efficient photocatalytic degradation abilities for methylene under visible light irradiation.60
Zhang and co-workers synthesized two perovskite PbTiO3-type lead-doped titanium-oxo clusters (PTC-58 and PTC-59) by the protection effect of TC4A ligands (Fig. 3a–c).61 Most importantly, these two clusters easily dissolved in chloroform and showed high stability in solution. The authors spin-coated the clusters to fabricate high-quality homogeneous films to employ as electron-transport materials in perovskite solar cells. The average power conversion efficiency values are 15.4 ± 1.9%, 15.4 ± 1.8%, and 14.9 ± 1.3% for the control devices, the PTC-58-based device, and PTC-59-based device, respectively (Fig. 3d). Moreover, the PTC-58-based and PTC-59-based devices exhibited significantly improved cell stability over 70% retention of their initial efficiency after operating for more than 500 hours (Fig. 3e).

Electrocatalysis
In 2017, Dai's group designed and synthesized two coordination containers (1-Co and 1-Ni) through the assembly of p-tert-butyl sulfonylcalix[4]arene (H4TC4A-SO2), M2+ (M = Co, Ni), and a pyridinium-functionalized angular flexible dicarboxylate ligand 4-carboxy-1-(4-carboxybenzyl)pyridinium bromide (H2BrL1), respectively. These coordination containers consist of two M4-TC4A-SO2 SBUs connected by four L1 (Fig. 4a). Because of the highly functionalized cavities originating from the pyridinium units, which facilitate hydroxide ion transport and encapsulation, the coordination cages 1-Co and 1-Ni exhibited excellent electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction activity.66 For example, 1-Co delivers a 10 mA cm−2 current density at an overpotential of 0.290 V, and 1-Ni shows a comparable overpotential of 0.302 V (Fig. 4b). Furthermore, the 1-Co and 1-Ni catalysts exhibit prominent stability over 48 h without any obvious shift in the overpotentials (Fig. 4c). This information demonstrated that pyridinium functionalization of these two coordination containers is the primary cause of the enhanced electrochemical water oxidation performance.

In 2019, Bi and co-workers successfully prepared a thiacalixarene-supported bimetallic cluster (Co4Mo8) that featured a sulfur-modified polyoxometalate Mo8 cluster capped by a Co4-TC4A unit (Fig. 5a). It was found that this cluster can directly anchor on nickel foam and employed as a working electrode, giving significantly improved electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction, achieving an overpotential of 302.8 mV at 10.0 mA cm−2 in alkaline solution (Fig. 5b). In contrast, the replacement of the Co atom in Co4Mo8 with a Ni or Zn atom (Ni4Mo8 or Zn4Mo8) and component-controlled investigations exhibited higher onset potential and lower current density under similar conditions. These results revealed that the Co–Mo synergistic effect was responsible for the extraordinary oxygen evolution reaction performance. In addition, the deliberately incorporated sulfur atoms at the lower rim of the Co4Mo8 cluster, facilitating the adherence between the cluster and nickel foam, resulted in the binder-free electrocatalyst with efficient and ultra-stable oxygen evolution reaction performance (366.8 mV at 40.0 mA cm−2 for more than 150 hours).64

Later, the same group reported two thiacalixarene-supported clusters (Co26 and Ni28) by employing an asymmetrical 1-hydroxy-2-(3-pyridinyl) ethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid (H5L, risedronic acid) auxiliary ligand (Fig. 6a). Co26 features a rod-like Co26 core built from six Co4-TC4A SBUs and four HL4− with two additional cobalt ions. Ni28 contains a flower-like Ni28 core constructed by six Ni4-TC4A SBUs, six HL4− and four extra nickel ions. The various coordination modes of risedronic acid connect with the M4-TC4A SBUs, endowing the two clusters with high-density possible coordinatively unsaturated metal sites. Co26 and Ni28 clusters were directly dispersed on carbon paper (CP) and exhibited extraordinary oxygen evolution reaction activity with overpotentials of 364.0 mV and 386.8 mV at |j| = 10 mA cm−2, respectively (Fig. 6b), and long-term stability for the oxygen evolution reactivity in alkaline media. Furthermore, these two clusters could serve as precursors to prepare serial multicomponent materials by pyrolysis at different temperatures.67

Liao's group reported a {Co26} molecular architecture (CIAC-126) assembled from six Co3-TC4A SBUs, one Co8 cubic cluster and 12 bridging imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylic ligands (Fig. 7a).68CIAC-126 featured a three-piece burr puzzle in which each piece is perpendicular to the other two as the axes in a 3D Cartesian coordination system, leading to abundant edge defects. The composite of CIAC-126 and the commercial ordered mesoporous carbon (CMK-3), CIAC-126&CMK-3 (w/w = 1/3), showed Pt-like electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction activity with an E1/2 of 0.786 V (vs. RHE), an Eonset of 0.874 V (vs. RHE), and a JL of 7.78 mA cm−2 (Fig. 7b). More importantly, the stability of CIAC-126&CMK-3 is higher than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst, and there is almost no change in the polarization curve after 3000 cycles (Fig. 7c). These results demonstrated that the Pt-like electrocatalytic activity of CIAC-126&CMK-3 is attributed to the synergistic effect of the two components, which provide both accessible active sites and electrical conductivity, respectively.

Very recently, the group of Liao successfully prepared a {Ni20} coordination wheel (CIAC-246) assembled from five Ni4-TC4A SBUs, five 2,5-dihydro-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2,5-dithiol ligands, and five sulfate anions (Fig. 8a). Because of the accessible active nickel sites and the through-hull channel with proper size, CIAC-246 showed efficient electrocatalytic activity for glucose oxidation with a low onset potential and peak potential (Fig. 8b and c).69

Thiacalix[4]arene-supported coordination cage involved active components
Coordination cages possessing chemically tuneable nanocavities decorated with catalytically active sites can not only provide restricted and isolated internal microenvironments that can bind substrates strongly and bring reactants close together but can also take part in reactions.
Wang and co-workers reported a cylindrically shaped coordination cage (MOSC-1) constructed from Co2+ ions, H4TC4A-SO2, and an angular semi-flexible organic ligand 4,4′-methylenedibenzoic acid. MOSC-1 can be viewed as two Co4-(TC4A-SO2) SBUs occupying the vertices of the cylinder linked by four dicarboxylate ligands. MOSC-1 exhibited size/shape-selectivity for Knoevenagel condensation (Fig. 9a). When the molecular shape and size of the aldehyde group match the cage cavity, the reactivity increases. In contrast, other aldehyde substrates do not fit the binding pocket, and low reactivity is observed. Furthermore, this cage can lead to increased reactivity for some unreactive aldehydes via further modulating its electrostatic microenvironment of the binding cavity and the Brønsted acidity using tetraalkylammonium-based regulators. When the 4,4′-methylenedibenzoic acid is replaced with 4,4′-iminobis(methylene)dibenzoic acid, an isostructural cage MOSC-2 was obtained. MOSC-2 exhibited excellent catalytic activity for Knoevenagel condensation owing to the electrostatic microenvironment of the binding cavity provided by its Lewis basic active sites derived from secondary amine groups (Fig. 9b).70,71

In 2018, Cui et al. presented a chiral octahedral coordination cage built from six tetravalent four-connected Zn4-(TC4A-SO2) SBUs and 12 enantiopure Mn(salen)-derived dicarboxylic acids. This nanocage possesses a large hydrophobic cavity (3944 Å) decorated with chiral metallosalen active sites, making it an efficient and reusable catalyst for asymmetric transformations.72 Only 1.0 mol% of this cage can promote the oxidative kinetic resolution of racemic secondary alcohols with good conversions (52–62%) and excellent-to-high enantioselectivities (81–99.1% ee) (Fig. 10). Additionally, the selectivity factor Krel (the ratio of relative rates of the two substrate enantiomers) is up to 35.0. Furthermore, this cage can serve as a potential catalyst for the epoxidation of olefins with up to 99% enantiomeric excess. In 2019, the same group successfully synthesized two octahedral coordination cages using Ni4/Co4-(TC4A-SO2) SBUs and the enantiopure 4,4′,6,6′-tetra(benzoate) ligand of 1,1′-spirobiindane-7,7′-phosphoric acid.73 Most interestingly, hydrophobic interactions between tert-butyl groups and intercage hydrogen bonds formed between carboxylic and phosphoric acid groups could direct the hierarchical assembly of the coordination cages into a robust porous hydrogen-bonded organic framework with chiral phosphoric acid. The framework could serve as a heterogeneous and recyclable Brønsted acid catalyst to promote asymmetric [3 + 2] coupling of indoles with quinone monoamine and Friedel–Crafts alkylation of indole with aryl aldimines with enantioselectivities up to 99.9% ee. Moreover, this catalyst can be recovered and recycled at least 10 times without any loss of activity and enantioselectivity.

In addition to serving as reaction vessels, coordination cages can provide a special microenvironment, where cocatalysts can be sequestrated within the cavity. In this way, coordination cages can prevent the reactive cocatalysts from diffusing into the bulk solution, which will improve their reactivity, stability, and lifetime. In 2016, Liao and co-workers reported a trigonal prismatic cage (CIAC-121) constructed by six Ni4-(TC4A-SO2) SBUs and 12 2,5-thiophenedicarboxylic acid (TDC). The TDC ligands were embedded in the cage, and the cage cavity was decorated with 12 sulfur (S) atoms. Owing to the suitable cage cavity size and the intense covalent interaction between S and platinum (Pt) atoms, CIAC-121 can effectively encapsulate ultrafine Pt nanoclusters (NCs, less than ∼18 Pt atoms, Pt@CIAC-121) (Fig. 11a). The obtained Pt@CIAC-121 catalyst exhibited remarkable catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction with a low overpotential (an initial potential of −0.24 V) and high current density conditions (10 mA cm−2 μg−1 Pt at a potential of −0.48 V), which is significantly higher than that of a Pt/C catalyst (Fig. 11b).74

In 2018, Liao's group also introduced a 2-mercaptonicotinic acid (H2MNA) linker to crosslink Ni3-TC4A SBUs to give a {Ni18} coordination wheel (CIAC-123) (Fig. 12a). The active nickel centres endow CIAC-123 with the ability to facilitate the electrocatalytic glucose oxidation at the initial and peak potentials of 0.30 and 0.46 V, respectively (Fig. 12b). Particularly, the catalytic reaction did not depend on the atmosphere (such as air, O2 or N2) (Fig. 12c), demonstrating that CIAC-123 would be a promising noble-metal-free electrocatalyst candidate for a compartmentless glucose–air fuel cell. In addition, the restricted pocket with sulfur atoms decorating the internal surface makes CIAC-123 a versatile template for the encapsulation of tiny metal NCs, such as Ru, Pt, Pd, Au, Ir, Rh, and AuPd. The catalyst in which CIAC-123 encapsulates the bimetallic AuPd NCs (AuPd@CIAC-123) (Fig. 12d) shows excellent electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (Fig. 12e).75

In 2018, Zhou and co-workers successfully synthesized an octahedral coordination cage (PCC-2a) assembled from six tetranuclear Co4-(STC4A) (H4STC4A = p-sulfonic-sulfonylcalix[4]arene) SBUs as vertexes and eight panel 4,4′,4′′-benzene-1,3,5-triyltribenzoic acid ligands as faces. The cage has a large cavity and 30 negative charges that endow it with the capability to trap ruthenium (Ru) precursors and regulate the sizes and structures of the Ru nanoparticles (NPs), giving unusual ultra-small (2.5 nm) face-centered-cubic Ru NPs (Ru NPs@PCC-2a) (Fig. 13a and b).76 Under the optimized conditions, the Ru NPs@PCC-2a catalyst showed remarkably enhanced catalytic activity for the methanolysis reaction of ammonia borane (NH3·BH3). The catalytic reaction could be completed (H2/AB = 3.0) within 4.5 min (Ru/AB = 3.5/1000) at 298 K (Fig. 13c), affording a TOF of 304.4 mol of H2 per mol of Ru per min.

Apart from Ru NPs, this group continued to employ PCC-2a to encapsulate first-row transition-metal NCs. In addition, they systematically investigated the charge effect of the cages on the fabrication of the NCs by using PCC-2a and its analogue PCC-2b, which contains only 6 negative charges. When these two cages were used to encapsulate Co NCs, PCC-2a could encapsulate Co NCs that have a uniform particle size with a 2.5 nm diameter and generate a homogeneous catalyst Co NCs@PCC-2a. In contrast, PCC-2b resulted in aggregated Co NPs with much larger particle size, suggesting the formation of a mixture of the Co NPs and PCC-2b, Co NPs/PCC-2b. Most importantly, the Co NCs@PCC-2a catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic activity toward the hydrolysis of NH3·BH3, which is superior to those of other NC catalysts in the first row of transition metals, while Co NPs/PCC-2b exhibited no significantly catalytic activity toward the reaction.77
In addition to metal NPs or NCs, a coordination cage can be engineered to encapsulate transition-metal catalysts to improve the catalytic reactivity and stability. Zhou and co-workers utilized the above-mentioned PCC-2a as a host to encapsulate a cationic [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (bpy = bipyridine) catalyst (Fig. 14a).78 The encapsulated [Ru(bpy)3]2+ catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic activity for the photodegradation of methylene blue (MB), and 94.9% degradation of MB was achieved after 4 h under visible light irradiation (Fig. 14b). In contrast, only 19.8% MB was degraded by the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ catalyst under the same conditions. The mechanical study demonstrated that the key for efficiency promotion is that PCC-2a reduces the distance of the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ catalyst and the substrate.

Conclusions and perspectives
Thiacalix[4]arene analogues are unique components as both structural motifs and functional genes in the assembly of molecular clusters. In this perspective, the recent important developments of thiacalix[4]arene-based molecular architectures in catalysis are presented. However, there are some challenges to be considered in future research studies.
On one side, the shuttlecock-like Mx-thiacalix[4]arene SBUs holding the desired curvature are appealing to assemble molecular clusters with various shapes and sizes via the coordination of adequate organic linkers in a modular fashion. Though significant advances have been achieved towards the rational design of thiacalixarene-supported molecular assemblies in recent years, greater insights into the many subtle factors affecting their shape and size are still required.
On the other side, thiacalix[4]arene-supported metal clusters that can be viewed as a category of metal-chalcogenide clusters, which contain rich M–S bonds, possessing desirable properties, have been demonstrated by recent works in which hydrogen evolution catalysts can be prepared from Mo–S or Ti–S clusters. Although the utilization of these architectures remains in the infancy stage, the emerging thiacalixarene-based metal clusters are a promising candidate to be multifunctional metal-sulfur-based materials.
Furthermore, stability is an important parameter for potential applications of a catalyst. Theoretically, the incorporation of the thiacalixarene sheets to the molecular clusters can effectively maintain the stability of the catalyst. It is notable that the protection effect is proved feasible through cycling the catalytic reaction or detecting the leaching of metal ions into the filtrate. However, the dispersible nature of such molecular catalysts makes it possible to use a mass spectrum to detect their integrity in practical applications. More importantly, the unique dispersible properties of molecular clusters in some common solvents make the recrystallization and subsequent X-ray diffraction feasible.
Finally, the atomically precise structures of the molecular cluster catalysts and the possible crystal structures after catalysis make it easy and feasible to set up the theoretical models. Therefore, the structure–property relationships of thiacalixarene-based metal clusters can be understood at the atomic level.
Considering the rational design (especially modular construction), M–S-rich component and some merit beyond catalysis, we believe that the intensive applications of thiacalixarene-based metal clusters can be expected.
