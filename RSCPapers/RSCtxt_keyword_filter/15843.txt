    , Accepted 22nd April 2008First published on 29th May 2008AbstractA series of [Pt(II)(diimine)(dithiolate)] complexes of general formula [Pt{X,X′-(CO2R)2-bpy}(mnt)] (where X = 3, 4 or 5; R = H or Et, bpy = 2,2′-bipyridyl and mnt = maleonitriledithiolate), have been spectroscopically, electrochemically and computationally characterised and compared with the precursors [Pt{X,X′-(CO2R)2-bpy}Cl2] and X,X′-(CO2R)2-bpy. The study includes cyclic voltammetry, in situEPR spectroelectrochemical studies of fluid solution and frozen solution samples, UV/Vis/NIR spectroelectrochemistry, hyrid DFT and TD-DFT calculations. The effect of changing the position of the bpy substituents from 3,3′ to 4,4′ and 5,5′ is discussed with reference to electronic changes seen within the different members of the family of molecules. The performance of the mnt complexes in dye-sensitised solar cells has been previously described and the superior performance of [Pt{3,3′-(CO2R)2-bpy}(mnt)] is now explained in terms of decreased electronic delocalisation through twisting of the bipyridyl ligand as supported by the EPR and computational results.
Introduction
Complexes of Pt(II) with polypyridyl ligands have been widely studied due to properties including redox activity, solvatochromism and luminescence.1,2 In most cases, ligands on the Pt centre can be readily varied, allowing for manipulation of the molecular and electronic properties of these complexes making them useful as model systems for the study of many physical properties. In recent years square-planar Pt(II) coordination complexes have also been studied for their potential use in the area of dye-sensitised solar cells (DSSCs)3–6 and in solar to chemical energy conversion.7 In a DSSC, a dye molecule is adsorbed on to the surface of a semiconductor (usually TiO2). Upon illumination with visible light, the photo-excited dye injects an electron into the conduction band of the semiconductor, which is supported on a transparent electrode. The dye is re-reduced by a redox couple (typically I−/I3−), which in turn is regenerated at the counter electrode, thus completing the circuit.8
The dye molecule in a DSSC requires a linker moiety which attaches the dye to the surface of the semiconductor9 and in the large majority of studies this has been the (4,4′-CO2H)2-bpy ligand (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridyl). The 4,4′-substituted carboxylic acid groups on the bpy bind to the surface of the semiconductor allowing electron transfer from the excited dye molecule to the semiconductor. This electron transfer reaction is facilitated by the interaction of the π* orbital on the substituted bpy with the 3d orbital manifold of the conduction band of the TiO2.
An attractive feature of [Pt(diimine)(dithiolene)] complexes is the ease with which the HOMO and LUMO of the molecule can be separately tuned. Over the past two decades, Eisenberg et al. have systematically studied the electrochemistry and luminescence of a range of these molecules by sequentially changing the substituents on the diimine and dithiolene components.2 This has shown that the excited state energies can be tuned by up to 1 eV. Such studies have demonstrated that the LUMO on [Pt(II)(diimine)(dithiolate)] complexes is located on the diimine functionality and the HOMO is a mixture of Pt(d) and S(p) orbital character. The visible charge-transfer transition for these molecules is therefore assigned as a MMLL′CT (mixed metal–ligand to ligand charge transfer) from the Pt/S HOMO to the diimine based LUMO.1,2,10 These previous studies have focussed almost exclusively on complexes with 4,4′-disubstitued diimine ligands.1,2,10
We have recently reported the synthesis and study in DSSCs of a series of [Pt(II)(diimine)(dithiolate)] complexes, that bind to the semiconductor surface through a bpy ligand substituted with carboxylic acid groups at the positions, 3,3′, 4,4′ and 5,5′ respectively. The solar-energy conversion efficiencies of the resulting complexes were studied and interestingly showed the 3,3′-disubstituted bpy molecule to be the most efficient sensitiser of those tested.6 In marked contrast, studies of Ru–bpy dyes (the most efficient class of sensitiser) in DSSCs have focussed almost entirely on 4,4′-substitution. We are only aware of one Ru dye involving 3,3′-(CO2H)2-bpy ligands that has been studied in DSSCs and this showed slightly poorer results than the analogous Ru complex with 4,4′-(CO2H)2-bpy ligands.11 Presumably, the slightly poorer performance is the reason for the lack of further interest, however our results on Pt complexes suggest that 3,3′-(CO2H)2-bpy ligands are worth revisiting.
Following this discovery, the aim of the current work is to greatly extend our understanding of the electronic properties of [Pt{X,X′-(CO2Et)2-bpy}(mnt)] (X = 3, 4 or 5; mnt = maleonitriledithiolate) by systematic electronic characterisation of each member of this family and comparison with related precursors, (Fig. 1) using UV/Vis/NIR spectroelectrochemistry, in situEPR spectroelectrochemistry and DFT calculations. In particular, this allows insight into the bpy based LUMO which influences not only the photophysical and electronic properties of the molecules, but also the coupling to TiO2 and consequent electronic properties of the composite system. We have reported some initial work on the UV/Vis/NIR spectroelectrochemistry of 1c–3c6 in our original study and this is incorporated here in the discussion.

The electrochemical properties show various trends which are common within each of the 3,3′, 4,4′ and 5,5′ motifs. In each case the free bpy ligand shows either one or two reductions within the solvent window. On binding to the Pt centre, the reduction potentials significantly shift to more positive values due to the stabilisation of the LUMO after complexation of the free ligand to the Pt metal. On substitution of the two chloride ligands with the mnt ligand, each [Pt{X,X′-(CO2Et)2-bpy}(mnt)] complex (1c, 2c and 3c) shows two fully reversible reductions, the potentials of which remain similar to those of their respective [Pt{X,X′-(CO2Et)2-bpy}Cl2] precursors (Fig. 2), particularly for the first reduction. This shows that there is only a small effect on the LUMO of the complex after substitution of the chloride ligands for mnt, consistent with assignment of the LUMO as bpy based.2

Cyclic voltammogram showing reduction processes for 2a (dash-dot green), 2b (solid black) and 2c (dashed red) in 0.1 M TBABF4–DMF at 293 K and scan rate 0.1 V s−1. 
In addition, each of the [Pt{X,X′-(CO2Et)2-bpy}(mnt)] complexes (1c, 2c and 3c) shows one irreversible oxidation at a similar potential to each other, consistent with location of the HOMO on the dithiolate moiety.

Reduction of the free ligand becomes harder in the order {5,5′-(CO2Et)2-bpy}, {4,4′-(CO2Et)2-bpy}, {3,3′-(CO2Et)2-bpy}, since the electron-withdrawing groups at the 5,5′ position of the bpy provide greater stabilisation of the monoanion than substituents at the 4,4′ or 3,3′ positions.12 The electrochemistry of [Pt{5,5′-(CO2Et)2-bpy}(mnt)] (3c) shows both reductions at the least negative potential of the series 1c–3c, as expected,12 however the first reduction potential (E1) of [Pt{3,3′-(CO2Et)2-bpy}(mnt)] (1c) occurs at less negative potential than that of [Pt{4,4′-(CO2Et)2-bpy}(mnt)] (2c) which is in contrast with the reduction potentials of the free ligands 1a and 2a. The crystal structure of [Pt{3,3′-(CO2Et)2-bpy}(mnt)] previously reported by us6 shows a significant torsion angle (30.7°) between the two pyridine rings of the bpy moiety while [Pt(II)(bpy)(dithiolate)] complexes with substituents at the 4,4′ positions have much smaller torsion angles e.g. 0.68° for a di-Me substituted bpy,13 and 12.69° for a di-tBu substituted bpy14 (the biggest for any 4,4′-disubstituted bpy). This suggests that the structural differences between the 3,3′ and 4,4′ disubstituted molecules influence their relative electrochemical responses and this results in the first reduction of 1c being intermediate between that of 2c and 3c. For each of the molecules studied, the separation of the first and second reduction is between 0.36 V and 0.66 V. This is associated with the spin pairing energy of the two added electrons in the same orbital (vide infra).
The electrochemistry of the carboxylic acid substituted complexes (1d, 2d and 3d) shows broadly similar oxidation and reduction potentials to those of the ester-substituted complexes (1c, 2c and 3c), suggesting that the more-soluble ester species used for convenience in the further studies below are good models for the acid derivatives used in DSSCs.
(ii) Spectroelectrochemistry

          UV/Vis/NIR spectroelectrochemistry of reduced 1c, 2c and 3c was reported in our prior work6 and in this work we have also studied the spectroelectrochemistry of the corresponding species 1a,b, 2a,b and 3a,b as well as oxidations of 1c, 2c and 3c, which were observed to be chemically reversible at −60 °C (observed absorptions are tabulated in the ESI, Table S1, Fig. S1–S4†). Electrochemical reduction to the monoanionic and dianionic species for 1a–c, 2a–c and 3a–c show similar trends. For the complexes 1–3b and 1–3c, similar bands appeared compared with the free ligands 1–3a consistent with the reduction electron locating on the bpy ligand. Spectral features of the reduced, substituted bpy ligands in turn were similar to the unsubstituted bpy1−.15 Upon oxidation of 1c, 2c and 3c, each of the spectra show similar features (e.g. Fig. S4†). On generation of the 1c1+, 2c1+ and 3c1+, the peaks associated with the π–π* transition of the coordinated bpy shift to lower energy. This has previously been shown in a study of [Ru(bpy)3]3+ and [Ir(bpy)3]3+ where the π–π* transition of the coordinated bpy shifted to lower energy as the positive charge on the complex was increased.16,17 In the monooxidised species, the decrease in intensity of the peak at 19000 cm−1, which has already been assigned as a MMLL′CT peak from the mnt moiety, is consistent with the site of oxidation as based at least in part on the mnt motif.
(iii) EPR in fluid solution

In situ
EPR spectroelectrochemistry was performed on each member of the [Pt{X,X′-(CO2Et)2-bpy}(mnt)] series (1c, 2c, 3c) and comparison made where possible with the precursor species 1a,b, 2a,b and 3a,b. Data observed were broadly comparable to previous studies of related complexes.18
(a) Reduced 3,3′-(CO2Et)2-bpy ligand and complexes (1a1−, 1b1−, 1c1−)

Reduction of 1c in a solution of 0.1 M TBABF4 in DMF at 233K gives an EPR active solution of 1c1−. The coupling to the ligand nuclei is best resolved at 293 K (Fig. 3) and the coupling constants for 1c1− are presented, alongside those of 1b1− (Fig. S5†) in Table 2. Coupling is observed to the Pt centre, two ring N atoms and two ring H atoms. These are most likely to be the hydrogens in the 5,5′ positions as this has previously been shown to be the most electronically important position.12 This assignment is supported by DFT calculations (vide infra) that show the LUMO of the neutral complex to have a much higher contribution from the ring carbons in the 5-position than any of the other carbon atoms of the ring (Table S4†). On introduction of another electron to each complex and formation of 1b2− and 1c2− respectively, the signal collapses as the second electron enters the same orbital as the first and they spin pair. The similarities between the spectra of 1b1− and 1c1− are consistent with the reduction electron entering an orbital primarily located on the derivatised bpy motif analogous to the results found in the UV/Vis/NIR spectroelectrochemistry experiments. We were unable to obtain the spectrum for 1a1− due to poor stability in the reduced form.

(b) Reduced 4,4′-(CO2Et)2-bpy ligand and complexes (2a1−, 2b1−, 2c1−)

In situ
reduction of the ligand (2a) gives an EPR active solution (Fig. 4) with coupling constants listed in Table 3. The reduction electron couples strongly to the ring nitrogen and to one ring hydrogen on each pyridine ring. Again, the ring hydrogen atoms that show strong coupling can be assigned as those in the 5-position through DFT calculations that show the carbons in these positions give much the largest contribution to the LUMO of the neutral compound compared with the other ring carbons (Table 3).

The solution EPR of 2b1− at 233 K in solution of 0.1 M TBABF4 in DMF shows a broad line with two 195Pt satellites and any coupling to the ligand nuclei for this species remains unresolved at a range of temperatures. This is analogous to the in situEPR spectroelectrochemistry results for the related complex 2c1−. As was the case for 1b2− and 1c2−, on introduction of another electron to form both 2b2− and 2c2− the signals collapse as the second electron enters the same orbital as the first and they spin pair forming a diamagnetic species.
(b) Reduced 5,5′-(CO2Et)2-bpy ligand and complexes (3a1−, 3b1−, 3c1−)
The in situEPR spectrum of the {5,5′-(CO2Et)2-bpy}1− ligand (3a1−) shows coupling of the reduction electron to the two ring nitrogen atoms, and two sets of two ring hydrogen atoms assigned as shown in Table 3. It is of note in this case that no large coupling to ring hydrogens occurs since the most electronically important 5-positions contain the ester substituents rather than H-atoms.
The solution EPR of 3b1− at 273 K in solution of 0.1 M TBABF4 in DMF shows coupling of the reduction electron to the 195Pt nucleus. Any coupling to the ligand nuclei for this species remains unresolved at a range of temperatures similar to the results found for 2b1−. Again in this case the EPR spectrum of 3c1− is analogous to the in situEPR spectrum for the related dichloride complex 3b1− which shows a similar magnitude of the coupling of the reduction electron to the Pt nucleus.
(iv) EPR in frozen solutions
On cooling to 173 K rhombic X-band EPR spectra were obtained for 1b1−, 1c1− and 2c1− and, following spectral simulation, the parameters obtained are listed in Table 4. For all compounds, the average of g1 + g2 + g3 is in good agreement with giso. The small shift in giso from the free electron value, ge of 2.0023 suggests that there is only a small admixture of metal orbitals in the SOMO and that the reduction electron is therefore based mainly on the bpy ligand. These results reiterate the findings of the UV/Vis/NIR spectroelectrochemical study whereby the reduction electron locates itself on the bpy motif. In each case, coupling was resolved to the 195Pt nucleus for each of the g-components but no further splittings to ligand nuclei were resolved. Experimental and simulated spectra are shown in Fig. 5 and 6 and S7.† Previous studies have shown that the singly-occupied orbital in related complexes is of b2 symmetry assuming C2v point symmetry with metal contributions to the singly occupied orbital consisting of 5dyz and 6pz contributions. (The principle axes are defined as shown in Fig. 1.18) The contribution of these orbitals to the SOMO can be determined using eqn (1)–(3).18,19 Axx = As − (4/7)Pda2 − (2/5)Ppb2(1) Ayy = As − (2/7)Pda2 − (2/5)Ppb2(2) Azz = As + (2/7)Pda2 + (4/5)Ppb2(3)

This allows us to compare the effects of mnt substitution for two chloride ligands by examination of the values for 1b1− and 1c1−. It is apparent that a reduction in Pt contribution to the SOMO occurs in the mnt complex 1c1− and this may be associated with greater electron delocalisation in the latter consistent with the extended conjugation of the mnt. Likewise, we can compare the influence of altering the ester groups from the 4,4′ to the 3,3′-positions (2c1− and 1c1−). The former shows a noticably higher Pt contribution to the SOMO. This may be rationalised in terms of a better overlap between the bpy and the Pt orbitals for the 4,4′-derivative due to greater planarity across the molecules, whereas the twist in the bpy ligand of the 3,3′-analogue reduces the orbital overlap of the bpy ligand with the Pt centre.
(v) DFT calculations and discussion
To further interpret the electronic character of these complexes, hybrid density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed on 1b, 1c, 2a, 2c, 3a and 3c (see Experimental section for details). Plots of the isosurfaces and calculated energies of the HOMO, LUMO, HOMO − 1 and LUMO + 1 orbitals can be found in Fig. 7 (1c) and in the ESI (Fig. S8–S17†). A comparison of selected angles and bond distances from the calculated structure of 1c and the XRD structure shows that the calculated structure is very close to that experimentally observed, Table S6.† All calculations are consistent with the HOMO based largely on the mnt moiety and the LUMO largely based on the bpy moiety (Table S7†) as previously reported, with a larger total contribution of Pt orbitals to the HOMO than to the LUMO (Table 5) for 1c, 2c and 3c.1,2,10 For the dichloride 1b, the Pt contribution to the HOMO is seen to be much larger than for the three mnt-complexes in keeping with the capacity of the dithiolene ligand to enhance delocalisation of the frontier orbitals in the complex. We also observe that the Pt contribution to the LUMO in 1b, 1c and 2c matches the trend for the Pt contribution to the SOMO determined from the EPR results. In fact, there is also a reasonable match with the absolute values however, although gratifying, this may be fortuitous and it is the reproduction of the trend that is most significant.

The noticable difference in the Pt contribution to the LUMO/SOMO of 1c/1c1− compared with 2c/2c1− is likely to be due to the non-planar character of the former caused by the steric hindrance at the 3,3′-positions and we can therefore surmise that this causes poorer overlap with the Pt orbitals. Furthermore, the computational results show clear evidence of the consequences of this non-planarity in the LUMO and LUMO + 1 orbitals (Fig. 7). In particular, the latter orbital is localised on one of the pyridyl rings of the ligand only, in complete contrast to the corresponding orbital for the planar 2c (Fig. S13†) which is distributed over the whole bpy ligand.
Time-dependant density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations were carried out for 1c, 2c and 3c in the presence of DMF. This method has been previously used on similar platinum–diimine–dithiolate systems to great effect with the results showing a remarkable similarity to experimental observations.21,22 A summary of relevant calculated transitions for each complex can be found in Tables S8–S10† and figures showing the calculated transitions relative to the observed absorption spectrum are shown in Fig. 8 and S18.† The calculated composition of the lowest energy transition for all three complexes was found to be 70% HOMO–LUMO and MMLL′CT in nature as expected. The calculated energy was slightly underestimated, by an average of 1660 cm−1, for all three complexes. It should be noted that the inclusion of solvent in these calculations is essential, as has been observed previously in similar systems,23 as the TD-DFT studies carried out under vacuum vastly underestimated the energy of the MMLL′CT by ∼12000 cm−1. The highest energy transitions were identified as bpy intraligand transitions and calculated to be no more than 900 cm−1 from those observed. The relative size of the oscillator strengths match the relative intensities of the observed spectra well, with the bpy intraligand transitions being the most intense and the two CT bands being of a similar magnitude to one another. Lastly, the observed trend in the energy of the HOMO–LUMO transitions was reproduced with 1c being the lowest and 2c being the highest.

In our prior work we determined that 1c showed a better solar-to-electric power-conversion efficiency than 2c (and much better than 3c).6 In particular this arose from a higher open-circuit voltage for a cell using 1c which was explained by the longer charge recombination time (between electrons in the TiO2 and the oxidised dye) that was determined for this complex.6 This charge-recombination is known as a key loss process and its inhibition is one of the widely-studied approaches to dye design for DSSCs.24
The results presented in this work suggest that the longer-lived charge-separated state for complex 1c on TiO2 is related to the non-planar geometry of the complex. We have shown, by the lower contribution of the Pt orbitals to the SOMO/LUMO of 1c compared with 2c as shown by EPR/DFT studies, that this reduces the electronic coupling between the bpy ligand and the Pt(mnt) fragment of the dye as well as reducing the electronic coupling across the bpy ligand itself. According to the electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical results, the positive charge density on the oxidised dye is located largely on the mnt ligand and this conclusion is supported by DFT calculation of the HOMO location on the neutral complexes. The poorer electron delocalisation across the dye in the case of 1c will then lead to poorer electronic communication between the cation on the dye and electrons in the TiO2 giving a longer-lived charge-separated state.
Interestingly, the observation of significantly poorer photovoltaic performance using 3c is also consistent with this analysis. The electrochemical and EPR results in this work and previous ENDOR results demonstrate that the 5,5′-positions on the bpy are the most strongly electronically coupled to the ring. Thus, the poor performance of 3c may in part be explained by enhanced charge recombination via strong electronic communication from the TiO2 to the positive charge on the oxidised dyevia the acid groups in the 5-position of the bpy.
Conclusions
This work contains the first detailed spectroelectrochemical (UV/Vis/NIR and EPR) and DFT study on a family of [Pt(diimine)(dithiolate)] dyes and their synthetic precursors. These molecules are important in their relevance to the area of solar cell dyes and also more generally for their optical and electronic functionality. The optically transparent thin layer electrode (OTTLE) and in situEPR experiments confirm previous investigations which assign the location of the bpy based LUMO, although they also demonstrate partial involvement of the metal centre in the LUMO as indicated by coupling of the reduction electron to the Pt nucleus, supported by computational results. Trends in the OTTLE study of the mnt dyes indicate that in general the location of the reduction electron is similar within the 3,3′, 4,4′ and 5,5′ motifs.
Most significantly, the EPR and DFT studies provide a rationale for the superior performance of the 3,3′-substituted bpy-complex over the 4,4′-substituted bpy counterpart in DSSCs. This provides important guidance in the optimisation of such solar cell dyes in future studies and we suggest that the focus in the DSSC field on 4,4′-bipy ligands with almost no investigation of 3,3′-bipy may be a missed opportunity for dye enhancement.
Experimental
The synthesis of each compound 1–3(a–d) has previously been reported.6 Electrochemical studies were carried out using a DELL GX110PC with General Purpose Electrochemical System (GPES), version 4.8, software connected to an autolab system containing a PGSTAT 20 potentiostat. The technique used a three electrode configuration, with a 0.5 mm diameter Pt disc working electrode, a Pt rod counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) reference electrode against which the ferrocenium/ferrocene couple was measured to be +0.55 V. The supporting electrolyte was 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TBABF4), solvent was dry, degassed DMF and concentration of compound approximately 1 mmol.

        OTTLE measurements were taken using a quartz cell of 0.5 mm, a Pt/Rh gauze working electrode, an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a Pt wire counter electrode. UV-Vis spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 9 spectrophotometer, controlled by a Datalink PC, running UV/Winlab software. 0.1 M TBABF4 was used as the supporting electrolyte in all cases.25
All in situEPR spectra were recorded on an X-band Bruker ER200D-SCR spectrometer, connected to a Datalink 486DX PC running EPR Acquisition System, version 2.42 software. In situEPR experiments were electrogenerated using a BAS CV-27 voltammograph. Variable temperature work was carried out using a Bruker ER111VT variable temperature unit. In some cases, solution spectra were recorded at reduced temperature to ensure long-term stability of the reduced species. All g values were corrected to 2,2′-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl with gliterature = 2.0036 ± 0.0002. Spectra were simulated by manipulation of parameters until a satisfactory reproduction of experimental spectra was obtained, assuming couplings to the following nuclei: 195Pt (I = ½, 33.8% abundance), 1H (I = ½, 100% abundance) and 14N (I = 1, 100% abundance). Since each of these gives a different combination of nuclear spin (hence splitting) and natural abundance, no ambiguity in nuclear types arises in the simulations.
Density functional theory calculations of all complexes were performed using either the Gaussian 03 program package26 or the GAMESS-UK package.27 The starting structure was input using the builder program Arguslab and default convergence conditions of Gaussian 03 were used. The Becke three parameters hybrid exchange and the Perdew–Wang 1991 correlation functionals (B3PW91) were used.28,29 For the platinum atom the Hay–Wadt VDZ(n+1)ECP was used30 with the other atoms described by 6-31G*.31 The optimised structures were verified as minima on the potential energy surface by the absence of negative values in the frequency calculations. TD-DFT calculations were carried out in the presence of a polarisable continuum model (PCM) DMF32 solvation field, with the first 25 singlet transitions calculated.
