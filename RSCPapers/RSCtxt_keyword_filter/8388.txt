Introduction
With the increase of population and the improvement of economic development levels, the demand for energy is also rising. Traditional fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and natural gas, which are non-renewable energy sources, encounter the problems of environmental pollution and resource exhaustion. Therefore, the development of clean, green and pollution-free energy has become a global focus. A solar cell is a very efficient device to harvest the renewable and clean solar energy. In recent years, due to direct and tunable bandgaps,1–5 high electron/hole mobilities,6–8 strong light-absorption coefficient,9 and high defect tolerance coupled with low nonradiative recombination rates,10–12 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are receiving more and more research attention. Besides the traditional applications, PSCs, as very competitive photovoltaic devices, have also been expected to be used in many fields including photovoltaic curtains, building integrated photovoltaics, and wearable electronic devices.13–19 Great application potential promotes the rapid development of PSCs. In the last decade, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has been risen dramatically, from 3.8%20 to the present value which is beyond 23%.21,22
For PSCs, the usual chemical formula of perovskites is ABX3 (A = CH3NH3+/MA+, HC(NH2)2+/FA+, B = Pb, and X = Cl, Br, I).23 So far, both n-i-p and p-i-n planar structured devices have been developed. For the n-i-p structure device, one approach is to use compact titanium dioxide (TiO2) as the electron transporting layer (ETL) and spiro-OMeTAD as the hole transporting layer (HTL).24 However, the manufacturing process of TiO2 is complex, the material of spiro-OMeTAD has poor stability and the fabricated device usually has a large hysteresis behavior. Compared to the n-i-p structure, the device with the p-i-n structure possesses the advantages of simple manufacturing process and reduced hysteresis effect.25 Thus, the p-i-n structure device is used in this work. Besides the device structure, the method to prepare the perovskite material is also important for achieving a high device performance.26–28 Among various perovskite preparation methods, the two-step sequential deposition method27,28 is widely used. This method was first used in mesoscopic-structure devices and then soon applied to planar heterojunction devices.29 In a typical two-step sequential deposition of perovskites, PbI2 and PbCl2 in N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF) act as precursor solutions, which are subsequently converted into perovskite films by exposing them to an anhydrous isopropanol (IPA) solution of methylammonium iodide (MAI) and/or formamidinium iodide (FAI). However, it is very difficult to control the crystal quality of perovskites and achieve a highly compact and flat surface in the planar structure. The quality of the perovskite layer plays a key role in the performance of PSCs. Therefore, it is of great significance to optimize the formation process of perovskite films for solar cells. In the past few years, many methods such as interface modification,30–33 compositional engineering,34 and mixed-solvent-vapor annealing35,36 have been used to improve the perovskite film. However, most of the previous studies paid attention to improve the perovskite quality by focusing on the process before perovskite film formation. Besides that, a study about how to improve the perovskite quality after the film formation is also urgently required.
In this work, we demonstrate a facile way to improve the quality of perovskite films by using a MAI/IPA solution to post-treat the perovskite material after the film formation. Different concentrations of MAI in IPA (0 mg ml−1 MAI, 2 mg ml−1 MAI and 4 mg ml−1 MAI) are selected to investigate the effect of post-treatment on the perovskite films. It is found that an optimal, uniform, dense and highly crystalline perovskite film is formed after the 2 mg ml−1 MAI/IPA post-treatment demonstrated by the X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. The transient photocurrent (TPC) and transient photovoltage (TPV) also confirm that the devices after the post-treatment have both the outstanding ability of charge extraction and suppressed charge recombination. By using 2 mg ml−1 MAI/IPA solution post-treatment, the device performance is greatly improved and we can get a PCE of 19.08%, with a short current density (Jsc) of 23.12 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.08 V and a fill factor (FF) of 76.03%, which is improved by 12% compared to the control device. At the same time, the device shows a weak hysteresis effect. All the results show that the MAI/IPA solution post-treatment after the perovskite film formation is a facile way to improve the film quality and the PSC performance.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the schematic structure of the device and the strategy to prepare the perovskite film. A p-i-n structure with NiOx as the HTL and PCBM as the ETL is used in this work. To prepare the perovskite film, PbI2 and PbCl2 were dissolved in DMF solution (named PbX2 soluiton) and spin-coated on the NiOx layer as shown in Fig. 1(a). Fig. 1(b) shows that MAI and FAI were dissolved in IPA solution and then spin-coated on the PbX2 layer. The film was annealed at 104 °C for 10 min on a hotplate (Fig. 1(c)) so that the perovskite film could be formed by the inter-diffusion approach. It should be noted that in the conventional device fabrication, the perovskite film preparation has no further steps. However, in this work, we use the MAI/IPA solution to further post-treat the perovskite film after the film formation and anneal it for the second time. As shown in Fig. 1(d) and (e), the perovskite film is post-treated with the MAI/IPA solution after the film has been formed and then annealed for the second time. For better clarity of expression, the device without the post-treatment is named the control device, and the device with post-treatment is named the MAI device (for example, the device with the 0 mg ml−1 MAI/IPA solution treatment is called the 0 mg ml−1 MAI device).

Fig. 2(a) shows the J–V characteristic curves of the control device, 0 mg ml−1 MAI device, 2 mg ml−1 MAI device, and 4 mg ml−1 MAI device in forward scanning. The results of the reverse scanning and the dark current are shown in Fig. S1.† As can be seen from Fig. S1(b),† with MAI/IPA solution post-treatment, the devices have a small dark current. That is because after MAI/IPA solution post-treatment, the device has fewer defects37 and low leakage current, resulting in the reduction of dark current. Table 1 also shows the corresponding device parameters. Fig. 2(a), Fig. S1† and Table 1 demonstrate that the control device shows a PCE of 17.04%, with Jsc = 21.59 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.07 V and FF = 73.62% in forward scanning. And in reverse scanning, the control device shows a PCE of 16.99%, with Jsc = 21.79 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.06 V and FF = 73.34%. It can be concluded that after the MAI/IPA solution post-treatment, the device performance is obviously improved. The 0 mg ml−1 MAI device shows a PCE of 17.27%, with Jsc = 22.06 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.08 V and FF = 72.48% in forward scanning. And in reverse scanning, the 0 mg ml−1 MAI device shows a PCE of 17.14%, with Jsc = 22.22 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.06 V and FF = 72.11%. When the 2 mg ml−1 MAI/IPA solution is used to post-treat the film, the device performance is further improved. The 2 mg ml−1 MAI device achieves the highest PCE of 19.08%, with Jsc = 23.12 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.08 V and FF = 76.03% in forward scanning. And in reverse scanning, the 2 mg ml−1 MAI device shows a PCE of 18.60%, with Jsc = 23.11 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.07 V and FF = 74.65%. When a higher MAI concentration of 4 mg ml−1 is used to post-treat the film, the device performance begins to decrease. The 4 mg ml−1 MAI device achieves a PCE of 17.87%, with Jsc = 21.84 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.09 V and FF = 74.68% in forward scanning. And in reverse scanning, the 4 mg ml−1 MAI device shows a PCE of 17.14%, with Jsc = 21.80 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.09 V and FF = 72.15%. Generally, all the devices with the MAI/IPA solution post-treatment show an enhanced performance compared to the control device and the 2 mg ml−1 MAI/IPA solution is optimal. At the same time, it can be seen that all the devices show a negligible hysteresis effect, which shows the advantages of our used inverted p-i-n structure by using NiOx and PCBM as the HTL and ETL, respectively.

Fig. 2(b) shows the obtained IPCE spectra, which are used to check Jsc of these devices. When the perovskite films are post-treated with the 0 mg ml−1 and 4 mg ml−1 MAI/IPA solution, the IPCE values are mainly increased in the range of 350 nm to 450 nm. And when the optimal 2 mg ml−1 MAI/IPA solution is used, it can be seen that the IPCE value is obviously increased for the entire absorbed light wavelength. The integrated Jsc values from the IPCE measurement are 20.69 mA cm−2, 21.03 mA cm−2, 22.15 mA cm−2 and 21.11 mA cm−2 for the control device, 0 mg ml−1 MAI device, 2 mg ml−1 MAI device, and 4 mg ml−1 MAI device, respectively. It can be concluded that the obtained Jsc of IPCE matches well with the J–V measurements and this confirms the validity of our J–V measurement.
Steady-state output measurements of the control device, 0 mg ml−1 MAI device, 2 mg ml−1 MAI device, and 4 mg ml−1 MAI device are shown in Fig. 2(c) and S2.† The steady-state output was measured at the maximum power output point. From Fig. 2(c) and S2,† it can be seen that the steady-state output is relatively stable. The control device was measured at a PCE of 16.61% and a current of 19.25 mA cm−2 at a voltage bias of 0.81 V. The 0 mg ml−1 MAI was measured at a PCE of 17.83% and a current of 19.93 mA cm−2 at a voltage bias of 0.84 V. The 2 mg ml−1 MAI was measured at a PCE of 18.75% and a current of 20.43 mA cm−2 at a voltage bias of 0.90 V. The 4 mg ml−1 MAI was measured at a PCE of 17.15% and a current of 19.71 mA cm−2 at a voltage bias of 0.86 V. They are all close to the measurements of the J–V characteristic curve. In other words, the stability of the J–V characteristic curve and the dependence of solar cell performance on the MAI/IPA post-treatment are verified.
The statistics results of PCE for the control, 0 mg ml−1 MAI, 2 mg ml−1 MAI, and 4 mg ml−1 MAI devices are shown in Fig. 2(d). Other statistics results of Jsc, Voc, and FF are shown in Fig. S3.† It is demonstrated that after the post-treatment, all the parameters Jsc, Voc, and FF are enhanced, which leads to the improved device performance. As shown in Fig. 2d, the average PCE values of the control, 0 mg ml−1 MAI, 2 mg ml−1 MAI, and 4 mg ml−1 MAI devices are 16.79%, 16.83%, 18.57% and 17.50%, respectively. Obviously, when the concentration of MAI/IPA solution is 2 mg ml−1, the devices achieve the highest PCE, which is consistent with the results in Fig. 2(a).

Fig. 3(a) shows the optical absorption spectra of ITO/NiOx/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx with/without the MAI/IPA solution post-treatment. It can be seen that the control device has a relatively weak absorption ability. After the post-treatment, the absorption ability of the perovskite film is increased. The absorption of the 0 mg ml−1 MAI device is higher than that of the control device. And when the optimal 2 mg ml−1 MAI/IPA solution is used, the absorption ability of the perovskite film is further improved. Compared with the 2 mg ml−1 MAI device, the absorption of the 4 mg ml−1 MAI device is decreased again. This trend is consistent with the measured PCE as shown in Fig. 1(a). Besides the light absorption ability, it is believed that the post-treatment could also improve the crystallinity of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx, and thus XRD measurement is used to investigate the perovskite films and Fig. S3† shows the comparison of the (110) peaks for all the samples. Fig. 3(b) shows the XRD patterns of the perovskite films with/without MAI/IPA post-treatment. The crystal phases of XRD (110), (220) and (310) are near 14.16°, 28.54°and 31.98°, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3(b) and Fig. S3,† MAI solution of different concentrations has different effects on perovskite crystallization and all the perovskite films show higher peak intensity than the control sample. The peak value of the 2 mg ml−1 MAI device is higher than others, indicating that the crystallinity of the perovskite is increased significantly after the post-treatment of 2 mg ml−1 MAI/IPA solution. Therefore, the 2 mg ml−1 MAI device can achieve higher efficiency than others.

Fig. 3(c) shows the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the perovskite films with/without MAI/IPA solution post-treatment. The perovskite films are spun onto the ITO substrate directly for all the samples. Compared to the control film, the PL intensities increase for all MAI/IPA post-treated samples. Because the samples have the same interface between the substrate and the perovskite material and measurement was conducted at the same conduction for all the samples, the enhancement of PL intensity implies that the non-radiative recombination of excitons is greatly suppressed in the MAI/IPA post-treated samples. In addition, the film post-treated with 2 mg ml−1 MAI/IPA solution achieves the highest PL intensity, which is corresponding to the best performance of the device. On further increasing the MAI solution concentration, the PL intensity begins to decrease. It indicates that 2 mg mL−1 MAI/IPA post-treatment could achieve the best effect with significantly reduced non-radiative recombination and enhanced radiative recombination.
To further understand the decay behaviour of photon-generated carriers in the prepared samples, the time-resolved PL (TRPL) decay was measured, and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. 3(d). It is clearly found that the perovskite film post-treated with 2 mg ml−1 MAI/IPA solution has a longer carrier lifetime compared to other samples, suggesting good crystallinity and suppressed recombination due to less material defects of the perovskite film. The PL and TRPL clearly demonstrate that the quality of the perovskite film is increased and the non-radiative recombination is greatly suppressed. It is well known that perovskite films have many point defects, such as vacancies, interstitials and substitutions, located at the surface or grain boundary, which are recognized as one of the big obstacles toward high efficiency PSCs. It has been reported that formamidinium iodine (FAI) solution can be used to repair the surface defects of the perovskite film,37 which universally enhanced the device performance. Here, a similar function is achieved by the MAI solution, which in post-treatment is to react with the PbI2 residue and at the same time to repair the defects so that the performance of PSCs can be improved. Thus, after the post-treatment there is a good crystallinity and suppressed recombination due to less material defects of the perovskite film.
The charge recombination and charge extraction properties are further investigated by the TPC and TPV measurements for the devices with/without the MAI/IPA solution post-treatment. As shown in Fig. 3(e), the charge extraction time decreases for the post-treated devices compared with the control device. It is found that the device with 2 mg ml−1 MAI post-treatment has fast extraction (418.79 ns), and the control device has slow extraction (799.46 ns). For 0 mg ml−1 MAI and 4 mg ml−1 MAI, the excitation time is 670.81 ns and 566.40 ns, respectively. The charge extraction time for the device with 2 mg ml−1 MAI/IPA solution post-treatment is the shortest, which reveals the outstanding ability of charge extraction for this device. As shown in Fig. 3(f), the charge recombination lifetime increases after the post-treatment. Similar to the TPC measurement, the device with the 2 mg ml−1 MAI/IPA solution post-treatment achieves the longest charge recombination lifetime compared to other devices. This shows that the recombination is partially suppressed after the treatment. Both the TPC and TPV confirm that the devices after the post-treatment have both the outstanding ability of charge extraction and suppressed charge recombination, which will benefit the device performance.
In order to study the effect of MAI/IPA solution post-treatment on the growth of perovskite thin films, we employed SEM to investigate their morphology evolution. Fig. 4(a)–(d) show the SEM images of perovskite films with/without MAI/IPA solution post-treatment, and the statistics of the grain size of perovskite films in the SEM images are shown in Fig. S2(a).† As can be seen from Fig. 4(a), the grain size is not uniform and relatively small. Fig. 4(b) shows that the grain size increases after the 0 mg ml−1 MAI/IPA solution post-treatment. As MAI was easily soluble in IPA solution, unstable organic components on the surface of the perovskite were soluble in IPA solution with IPA post-treatment. Moreover, the organic components (MA) can easily evaporate. Therefore, it is observed that there are some bright small spots between the grains, which is believed to be the PbI2 residues.38 After the 2 mg ml−1 MAI/IPA solution post-treatment, the grain size is further increased and the distribution is relatively uniform as shown in Fig. 4(c). At the same time, the PbI2 residues disappear, and it is believed that the MAI reacts with the PbI2 residues and thus improves the film quality. Grain size and uniformity are critical for carrier transport. The larger grain size and the more uniform distribution will result in a stronger carrier transport capacity. Compared with 2 mg ml−1 MAI/IPA solution post-treatment, the grain sizes almost remained unchanged with 4 mg ml−1 MAI/IPA solution post-treatment. And there are also no PbI2 residues. However, 4 mg ml−1 MAI/IPA solution post-treatment makes the film rougher, which will be demonstrated by the AFM measurement.
 Fig. 4  (a) The SEM images of the ITO/NiOx/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films for the control device (a), 0 mg ml−1 MAI device (b), 2 mg ml−1 MAI device (c), and 4 mg ml−1 MAI device (d). 

Fig. 5 shows the AFM images (5 μm × 5 μm) of perovskite films with/without MAI/IPA solution post-treatment. Fig. 5(a) shows that the perovskite film for the control device is relatively smooth and has an RMS value of 7.46 nm. With 0 mg ml−1 MAI/IPA solution post-treatment, the RMS of the perovskite film slightly increases and reaches the value of 9.33 nm. It is believed that the IPA solution can partially wash away MAI and then increase the roughness, which can be verified by the PbI2 residues shown in Fig. 4(b). With the 2 mg ml−1 MAI/IPA solution post-treatment, the RMS of the perovskite film further decreases to 8.33 nm. This may be because the MAI in the MAI/IPA solution can react with the PbI2 residues and then make the perovskite film denser. Fig. 5(d) shows that the perovskite film with 4 mg ml−1 MAI/IPA solution post-treatment has an RMS value of 8.48 nm. Compared with 2 mg ml−1 MAI/IPA solution post-treatment, 4 mg ml−1 MAI/IPA solution post-treatment has made the surface of the perovskite film slightly rougher. The slightly increased RMS value is attributed to the enlarged crystal sizes after 4 mg ml−1 MAI treatment, and it may be one possible reason which leads to a decrease in efficiency. Taken together, the perovskite film with the 2 mg ml−1 MAI/IPA solution post-treatment has a large and uniform grain size, and at the same time it possesses a relatively smooth surface, which will benefit the device performance.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a facile way to improve the quality of perovskite films using a MAI/IPA solution to post-treat the perovskite material after the film formation. XRD, SEM and AFM show that optimal, uniform, dense and highly crystalline perovskite films are achieved after the MAI/IPA solution post-treatment. The TPC and TPV also confirm that the devices after the post-treatment have both the outstanding ability of charge extraction and suppressed charge recombination. By using 2 mg ml−1 MAI/IPA solution treatment, a maximum PCE of 19.08%, which is 12% higher than that of the control device, is obtained with a Jsc of 23.12 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.08 V and an FF of 76.03%. Simultaneously, the device shows negligible hysteresis. All the results show that the MAI/IPA solution post-treatment after the perovskite film formation is a facile way to improve the film quality and the PSC performance.

A p-i-n planar PSC was fabricated on pre-patterned ITO (indium tin oxide) glass substrates (around 2 × 2.5 cm2 in size, 10 Ω per square). The ITO glass substrates were ultrasonically cleaned with a detergent, deionized water, acetone, and ethanol for 30 min, respectively. Then, ITO glass substrates were treated in a UV-ozone system for 30 min to remove organic materials from the surface and improve the hydrophilicity. NiOx films were spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 45 s and annealed at 250 °C for 45 min on a hotplate. The two-step sequential deposition of the perovskite, which is widely used in PSCs, provides a low cost and efficient route to prepare perovskite films. Fig. 1 shows the strategy for the preparation and the treatment used in this work. Briefly, PbI2 and PbCl2 are dissolved in DMF solution and spin-coated on the NiOx layer with a speed of 3000 rpm and a time of 45 s as shown in Fig. 1(a). Fig. 1(b) shows that MAI and FAI were dissolved in IPA solution and then spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 45 s. The device was annealed at 104 °C for 10 min on a hotplate (Fig. 1(c)) so that the perovskite film could be formed by the inter-diffusion approach. In the conventional device fabrication, the perovskite film preparation has no further steps. However, we will use a facile way to further treat the film and improve the material quality. As shown in Fig. 1(d), the perovskite film is post-treated with the MAI/IPA solution after the film has been formed. MAI of different quantities was dissolved in IPA to prepare the solution (0 mg ml−1 MAI, 2 mg ml−1 MAI, and 4 mg ml−1 MAI). Then the MAI/IPA solution was spin coated on the perovskite films at 3000 rpm for 45 s as in figure (d). Figure (e) shows that post-treated films were formed after annealing at 104 °C for another 10 min. Then, the prepared perovskite films were covered with PC61BM. PC61BM was spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 45 s. Next, BCP films were spin-coated at 6000 rpm for 45 s. The thickness of the PCBM film was about 50 nm. The thin layer of BCP (0.5 mg ml−1 in IPA) was deposited on the top of the PCBM layer at 6000 rpm for 40 s. Finally, the films were transferred to a metal evaporation chamber, and 100 nm thick Ag contacts were deposited under high vacuum (<4 × 10−4 Pa). The active area was 0.07 cm2 defined by a shadow mask. The finished device in this work is shown in Fig. 1(f), which is an inverted p-i-n planar heterojunction structure. The schematic structure of the device is glass/ITO/NiOx/CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x/PC61BM/BCP/Ag. Here, NiOx and PCBM act as the HTL and ETL, respectively. BCP is used as the hole blocking layer and interface modification layer. The ITO and the Ag films act as the bottom and top transparent electrodes.
Device characterization
Photocurrent density versus voltage (J–V) curves were acquired using a solar simulator (Sanei Electric, XES-300T1) with a Keithley 2400 source meter and an AM 1.5 G filter with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The system was calibrated against a NREL certified reference solar cell. The incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a quantum efficiency measurement system (SCS10-X150, Zolix instrument. Co. Ltd). The UV-VIS system (PerkinElmer Lambda 950, Waltham, MA) was used to measure absorption. TPC measurement was performed with a system excited with a 532 nm pulse laser (MPL-H-532). TPV measurement was performed with the same system excited with a 405 nm CW laser (MDL-III-405) modulated by a square signal (200 Hz, 5 ms) generated by an arbitrary function generator (Tektronix, AFG3051C). A digital oscilloscope (Tektronix, MSO5204B) was used to record the photocurrent or photovoltage decay process with a sampling resistor of 50 Ω or 1 MΩ, respectively. The film morphology was characterized using a JSM-7800F extreme-resolution analytical field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) (Agilent 5500, Santa Clara, CA, USA). XRD spectra were obtained by probing samples with an X-ray diffractometer. All measurements of the solar cells were performed under ambient atmosphere at room temperature without encapsulation.
