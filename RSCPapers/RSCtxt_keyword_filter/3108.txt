Copper–boron–selenium (CuBSe2) is a chalcopyrite material with a near-optimum band gap of ∼3.13 eV. Semiconductor CuBSe2 nanorods were successfully prepared via a relatively simple and convenient solvothermal route. The device parameters for a single junction CuBSe2 solar cell under AM 1.5 G are as follows: open circuit voltage of 310 mV, short-circuit current of 25.5 mA cm−2, fill factor of 24%, and a power conversion efficiency of 1.89%. Based on a series of comparative experiments under various reaction conditions, the probable formation mechanism of crystals CuBSe2 nanorods is proposed.
1. Introduction

        Chalcopyrite compound semiconductors have been regarded as one of the most promising materials for thin film solar cells because of their unique structural and electrical properties, as well as high conversion efficiency and low toxicity.1–4 The chalcopyrite ternary semiconductor has been of interest as a crystalline thin film material for high efficiency solar cell applications.5,6 However, the widespread utilization of I–III–VI2 based solar cells requires the use of high-cost vacuum deposition techniques.7,8 The creation of a suitable inorganic nanocrystal for use in a scalable wet-chemical process is a key step in the development of low-cost solar cells.9–11 These methods require either very high temperature (typically 600–900 °C), high pressure or special apparatus. In addition, these methods have relatively long reaction times.
The device properties of I–III–VI2 based thin film solar cells are known to be critically influenced by their stoichiometric compositions, defect chemistry and structure, which are strongly related to the preparation conditions. For example, a I–III–VI2 film that was made by controlling the size, shape and composition of the layers at the nanoscale to form a reduced-dimensionality structure, has stronger absorption compared to bulk semiconductors.12–18 Here, we present the first report of a new material, chalcopyrite CuBSe2 nanorods and demonstrate that solvothermal based synthesis of these nanocrystals can be used to create simple thin film solar cells. In our work, a tandem solar cell with conversion efficiency of 1.89% under AM1.5 illumination has been reported. The main advantages of solvothermal synthesis are related to homogeneous nucleation processes due to elimination of the calcinations step to produce very low grain sizes and high purity powders.19–21To the best of our knowledge, CuBSe2 nanorods have never been grown and studied. Boron should yield a higher band gap, closer to the ideal value of 3.17 eV, for lower concentrations of boron than either gallium or aluminium.22 We have been interested in the use of solvothermal process, which are carried out at low temperatures and do not require toxic precursors, to prepare CuBSe2 nanocrystalline with a wide range of optical and electronic properties accessible in the nanoscale.
Experimental
Chemicals
All chemicals were used as received without further purification. Copper(II) chloride (CuCl2; 99.99%) from Aldrich Chemical Co.; elemental selenium (99.99%) from Strem Chemicals; boron oxide (B2O3; 99.99%) from Alfa Aesar; ethanol absolute and hydrochloric acid were from PA Panreac; diethylenetriamine, oleylamine and ethylenediamine were from Osaka Japan.
Preparation of chalcopyrite ternary CuBSe2 nanocrystals by solvothermal
In a typical experimental procedure, the product CuBSe2 can be prepared from a stoichiometric mixture of selenium (0.7896 g, 0.01 mol), copper(II) chloride (0.67 g, 0.005 mol), and boron oxide (0.3481 g, 0.005 mol) with magnetically stirred in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. The reagents were loaded into a 50 mL Teflon lined autoclave, which was then filled with anhydrous diethylenetriamine up to 80% of the total volume. The autoclave was sealed and was maintained at 180 °C for 36 h, and then allowed to cool to room temperature naturally. The black precipitate was filtered and washed with dilute hydrochloric acid, distilled water and absolute ethanol several times to remove the by-products. Finally, the product was dried under vacuum at 60 °C several hours and collected for its characterization.
Structural, optical and electrical characterization of chalcopyrite nanocrystals
The as-prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. XRD was carried out on a D/MAX-500 X-ray powder diffraction system with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). A scanning rate of 0.02 s−1 was applied to record the patterns in the 2θ range of 15–85°. TEM characterization was conducted on a JEM-2000EX system using an acceleration voltage of 160 kV. Vis-NIR absorption spectra of the nanomaterials in toluene were recorded at room temperature using a PerkinElmer, Lambda 750 UV-vis-near-IR spectrophotometer. Current–voltage characteristics were acquired using an Agilent 4155C semiconductor parameter analyzer, its scanning voltage tuned from 0 to 0.7 V.
Results and discussion
Crystalline structure and morphology of chalcopyrite ternary CuBSe2 nanocrystals
As known, X-ray diffraction (XRD) is the most convenient and effective tool for investigation of a crystalline structure; however, the standard XRD patterns of CuBSe2 could not be found in the literature and JCPDS card database. Nevertheless, we noticed that the XRD patterns of chalcopyrite CuxInySe0.5x+1.5y nanocrystals remain unchanged when the ratios of Cu to In were 1:1.23 Given their similar compositions, ternary CuBSe2 nanocrystals should exhibit chalcopyrite crystalline structures similar to those of the CuxInySe0.5x+1.5y. XRD patterns of the samples prepared in diethylenetriamine are shown in Fig. 1. The average crystal domain size of the nanocrystals calculated using Scherrer's equation based on the (112) peak is 65 nm (D = Kλ/(βcosθ); K = 0.89, λ = 0.15418 nm, β = FWHM, θ = diffraction angle). The major diffraction peaks observed at 26.65, 44.22, 52.39, 64.36, 70.90, and 81.38° 2θ can be indexed to the (112), (204)/(220), (116)/(312), (008)/(400), (316)/(332), and (228)/(424) of the sphalerite and chalcopyrite crystal structure, respectively. Thus, in order to determine that the nanocrystals are chalcopyrite, it is crucial to observe the minor peaks that are unique to the chalcopyrite structure. For instance, the minor peaks at 17.14°, 27.74°, and 35.55° corresponding to the (101), (103), and (211) peaks, respectively, are unique to the chalcopyrite structure (JCPDS 40-1487) and are shown as an inset of Fig. 1. As the reaction time increases to 36 h, the three minor diffraction peaks could be obtained gradually, indicating that the sphalerite phase form the chalcopyrite phase. According to the Vegard's law, the lattice constants measured for the samples were a = 5.782 ± 0.002 Å and c = 11.614 ± 0.002 Å, with the c/2a ratio of 1.007 ± 0.001. The observed lattice parameters and c/2a ratio agree very well with the reported values for the chalcopyrite phase.24

Fig. 2 shows the TEM image of chalcopyrite ternary CuBSe2 nanorods prepared in diethylenetriamine for 36 h. The sample of CuBSe2 synthesized in diethylenetriamine appears to display rod-like morphology with widths of 60 ± 5 nm, which is in agreement with the XRD result of 65 nm calculated from the Scherrer formula. The image is taken along the [10] zone axis with the (20), (02), and (04) crystallographic planes indicated by white lines. Spacing measurements based on 10 planes indicated d-spacings of 2.06 ± 0.02 Å for the (20) and 2.15 ± 0.02 Å for the (02) and (04). The measured angle between the (20) and (04) planes is 56.4 ± 0.2° and is 67.2 ± 0.2° between (02) and (04) planes. If the structure were sphalerite, the measured angles should be 60° between all three planes, and the measured d-spacings should be 2.02 Å. The zone axis of the SAED pattern was determined to be [10], and the pattern is typical for nanocrystals from this same synthesis procedure. We also observed additional diffraction spots, circled in white in Fig. 2b. These extra spots correspond to 2/3 the distance of the (4) or (21) fundamental reflections and have a d-spacing of 3.2 Å. Both high-resolution TEM (Fig. 2c) and XRD (Fig. 1) confirmed that the nanocrystals are crystalline with chalcopyrite ternary structure. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported solvothermal synthesis of chalcopyrite ternary CuBSe2 nanorods.

In this work, the solvent plays an important role in the formation of the chalcopyrite ternary CuBSe2 nanorods. Diethylenetriamine was selected as the solvent due to its strong basic capacity and strong chelation.25 It is well known that boron oxide and Se powders are soluble in diethylenetriamine at room temperature. In the solvothermal process, a nucleophilic attack by diethylenetriamine can activate boron oxide and elemental selenium to form B3− and Se2− ions. Furthermore, in this electron transfer reaction, diethylenetriamine, as a reducing solvent, can reduce Cu2− to Cu− ion, then Cu− complexes with diethylenetriamine to form [Cu (DIEN)2]+. The mechanism of the solvothermal process using diethylenetriamine as solvent was proposed as follows. 2B3+ + 3Se2− → B2Se3(1) B2Se3 + Se2− → 2(BSe2)−(2) Cu2+ + 2DIEN → [Cu(DIEN)2]+(3) (BSe2)− + [Cu(DIEN)2]+ → CuBSe2 + 2DIEN(4)
In addition, diethylenetriamine plays an important role in controlling the nucleation and growth of the product. Because of its N-chelation and special structure, it can easily chelate Cu+ (reduced from Cu2+) and form a relatively stable complex [Cu(DIEN)2]+. The formation of the complex can effectively prevent the formation of binary copper chalcogenides. To improve our understanding of the above mechanism, experiments were performed under similar conditions when diethylenetriamine was replaced by other solvents such as ethylenediamine and oleylamine. In oleylamine, many diffraction peaks appeared in the XRD patterns which could be indexed to copper selenide, and copper boron, but no characteristic peaks of chalcopyrite structure appeared (as shown in ESI, Fig. S1).† In ethylenediamine, a longer reaction time (at least 72 h) was required in order to obtain the product with almost the same crystalline as that in diethylenetriamine (as shown in ESI, Fig. S2).† The above results indicate that diethylenetriamine is the optimal solvent for this reaction.
Uniform single-crystalline CuBSe2 nanorods were successfully obtained by solvothermal route with diethylenetriamine at 180 °C for 36 h. The detailed formation process of CuBSe2 nanostructures with various solvent was studied (Fig. 3a–3c) and a clear solvent-dependent morphology evolution pathway from particle to rod-like shapes could be observed. Large-scale CuBSe2 contained particle were obtained with oleylamine and ethylenediamine as solvent (Fig. 3a and 3b). The nanorods began to grow up out of the particle surfaces and became longer and longer, but in contrast, the large-scale particles gradually diminished. The products obtained with diethylenetriamine as solvent almost exhibited 1D nanostructure could be observed (Fig. 3c).

The growth habits always directly determine the final crystal shape, which in turn is greatly influenced by its growth conditions. On the basis of the time-dependent morphology evolution evidence, we could hypothesize that formation of nanostructures and morphology evolution from particle to rod can be rationally expressed as a nucleation–dissolution–recrystallization mechanism.26,27 The schematic mechanism for the chalcopyrite semiconductor CuBSe2 nanocrystals obtained during different solvothermal stages is illustrated in Fig. 4. The detailed formation process of CuBSe2 nanostructures with various reaction times was studied (Fig. 4a–4c). At the very beginning, when the redox reaction was carried out in the solvothermal system at 180 °C for 36 h, the CuBSe2 nanocrystals with irregular shapes were formed in the solution through a homogeneous nucleation process. During the solvothermal process, large quantity of CuBSe2 nuclei were first formed due to the decomposition of a part of B2Se3 and CuSe precipitates, as shown in Fig. 4. On the other hand, certain B2Se3 and CuSe precipitates transformed into the growth units of (BSe2)− and [Cu(DIEN)2]+ under alkaline condition. As a consequence, the rod-like CuBSe2 crystals were formed. In our experiment, when using diethylenetriamine as the capping molecules, most of (BSe2)− and [Cu(DIEN)2]+ ions were precipitated into CuBSe2. Under solvothermal conditions, the obtained CuBSe2 nanoparticles could then agglomerate and self assemble to give the well-defined nanorods. So, the dissolved CuBSe2 in the solution might nucleate onto the active sites of the small protuberances, grow along 1D direction and recrystallize into CuBSe2 nanorods until the CuBSe2 particles almost completely dissolved. The recrystallization of CuBSe2 nanostructure as nanorod might be due to system alkalinity and the inter-reaction between certain crystal planes and alkaline ions. Alkaline ions have been proved to have structural-direction effect in other nanostructure formation.28

Optical and electrical characterization of chalcopyrite ternary CuBSe2 nanocrystals

Fig. 5 shows UV-vis absorption spectra and optical micrographs of the chalcopyrite ternary CuBSe2 nanorods synthesized by a solvothermal process at 180 °C for 36 h. With increasing the reaction time (at 180 °C for 20, 24, 30 and 36 h, respectively), the nanocrystals dispersed in toluene change their color from light to dark. The band gap energy determined from absorbance spectra (Fig. 5) of optically clear dispersions of nanocrystals was found to be 3.13 eV (396 nm), which is in good agreement with the reported in literature.22 Theoretical calculation shows that band gap of this new material CuBSe2 (CBS) should be 3.17 eV. To estimate this, the band gaps of CIS, CuGaSe2 (CGS), and CuBSe2 (CBS) were plotted as a function of the atomic mass of the column IIIA elements. Using following the band-structure theory equation:22Eg(CuIn1−xYxSe2) = (1 − x)Eg(CuInSe2) + xEg(CuYSe2) − bx(1 − x)Where Eg is a band gap, Y represents element of group IIIA periodic table, x is the fraction of Y concentration and b is a parameter, whose value ranges from −0.07 to 0.28.

UV-vis absorption spectrum of the as-synthesized CuBSe2 nanorods. The band gap of the nanocrystals is approximated using the direct band gap method by plotting the absorbance squared versus energy, and extrapolating to zero as shown in the inset. 
The CuBSe2 absorber layer may be formed simply by drop-casting on molybdenum coated soda-lime glass substrate. The films are annealed under flow of Ar at 500 °C for 3 h to remove the organic capping molecules. We fabricated the first batch of thin film solar cells in our laboratory using these films following chemical bath deposition of CdS layer, and RF sputtering of 60 nm intrinsic zinc oxide and 200 nm of ITO layers. The corresponding I–V characteristic and device structure of the solar cell are shown in Fig. 6. The final devices are scribed into small areas of 0.12 cm2 with a small drop of silver paint applied to form the top contact. The device parameters for a single junction CuBSe2 solar cell under AM1.5G are as follows: open circuit voltage of 310 mV, short-circuit current of 25.5 mA cm−2, fill factor of 24%, and a power conversion efficiency of 1.89%. Device efficiencies might be improved by increasing the CuBSe2 film thickness to absorb more photons. However, lower fill factor due to high series resistance causes lower performance of the present device. Overall, the fill factor of the CuBSe2 devices are lower than those typically reported for high-efficiency CIGSe solar cells, partly due to the large amount of dark areas from the silver contacts and shadow from the probe.29,30

Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully synthesized chalcopyrite semiconductor CuBSe2 nanorodsvia a relatively mild and convenient solvothermal process. The solvent plays an important role in the formation of the product and diethylenetriamine is the optimal solvent for this reaction. The size of the resulting nanorods could be controlled under the temperature at 180 °C for 36 h. The CuBSe2 nanorods with diameters in the range of 60–65 nm were obtained. Active area cell efficiencies up to 1.89% (Voc = 310 mV, Jsc = 25.5 mA cm−2, FF = 0.24%) have been demonstrated using the I–III–VI2 based absorber layer fabricated. However, we believe that synthesize process played a very important role in the result, because only solvothermal with diethylenetriamine as a solvent was found to be effective to form chalcopyrite nanocrystals. The optical band gap and lattice parameters of the alloyed nanocrystals are composition-dependent, following the equation and Vegard's law. These nanocrystals have good solubility in common solvents and may be potentially used as absorber and window materials in multi-junction photovoltaic cells and other applications.
