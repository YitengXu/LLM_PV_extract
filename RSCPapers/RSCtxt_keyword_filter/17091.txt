    , Accepted 26th February 2021First published on 6th April 2021AbstractInorganic perovskite CsPbBr3 is a suitable candidate owing to its excellent stability and outstanding visible light absorption.

1. Introduction
Recently, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted extensive interest owing to their low cost and outstanding photovoltaic performance.1–3 However, the intrinsic instability derived from the volatile, hygroscopic and labile properties of the organic cations still impedes the development of practical applications.4,5 Thereupon, it is a tendency that the development of inorganic perovskites is promoted by employing cesium (Cs+) instead of organic cations for overcoming the stability issues. Among CsPbX3 (X = I, Br, Cl) perovskites, CsPbBr3 is most balanced between light harvesting and stability, which makes it an alternative material for application in PSCs.6–8 The CsPbBr3 perovskites can maintain a stable structure at 460 °C close to their melting point without significant loss of mass9 and have a band gap of about 2.3 eV.10–14 However, it is a huge challenge to prepare single phase CsPbBr3 crystals.
Usually, the main CsPbBr3 crystals are produced with some secondary crystal phases, such as CsPb2Br5 and Cs4PbBr6 phases due to the different solubilities of PbBr2 and CsBr in solvents.15–17 An excess of PbBr2 dissolution in a solvent causes the increase of the CsPb2Br5 phase, and an excess of CsBr dissolution in a solvent leads to the increase of the Cs4PbBr6 phase.18–20 Chang et al. reported a CsPbBr3 crystal film method by using PbBr2 dimethylformamide (DMF) solution and CsBr methanol solution via a spin-coating procedure on FTO.21 Jiang et al. used the high solubility of CsAc to solve the problem of low solubility of CsBr in DMSO, and prepared CsPbBr3 films by one-step spin-coating.15 In order to improve the quality of the CsPbBr3 film, Huang et al. made an improvement on this basis. MABr and PbBr2 were dissolved in DMSO as solution A, and CsAc was dissolved in the mixed solution of DMSO and MAAC as solution B to form CsPbBr3 precursor solution, and the CsPbBr3 film was prepared by a one-step spin-coating substrate.16 Two secondary crystal phases (CsPb2Br5 and Cs4PbBr6 phases) are easily produced by using these methods. To solve this problem, Tang et al. developed a multi-step solution spin-coating method to fabricate CsPbBr3 films by repeating spin-coating PbBr2 film and CsBr procedures.17 It was found that the generation of CsPb2Br5 and Cs4PbBr6 phases in CsPbBr3 films is related to the repeating numbers. Nevertheless, it is true that the generation of secondary phases (both CsPb2Br5 and Cs4PbBr6) is still unavoidably associated with the preparation method of CsPbBr3 films.
In this work, we report an in situ metal reaction method to fabricate single phase CsPbBr3 films. As a precursor, the Pb film was firstly prepared by sputtering a Pb metal on to FTO. Secondly, CsPb2Br5 can be formed by reacting the Pb film with CsBr/HBr in a methanol solution. Finally, the single phase CsPbBr3 film was prepared via the reorganization of CsPb2Br5 and CsBr. Therefore, the thickness of the Pb film plays a key role in controlling the formation of the secondary CsPb2Br5 phase. The resulting single phase CsPbBr3 films have a uniform highly crystalline morphology with a close-grained structure. The CsPbBr3 films were used to fabricate FTO/SnO2/CsPbBr3/P3HT/carbon solar cells, which exhibit a promising efficiency of 4.08% and an outstanding stability.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials

Poly(3-hexylthiophene-2, 5-diyl) (P3HT, >90%) was bought from Sigma-Aldrich. Hydrobromic acid (HBr, 40% wt) was from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. Methyl alcohol (99.9%) was from Tianjin Fine Chemical Co. Ltd. The etched FTO (tin fluoride oxide, 8 Ω per square) glass substrates and the carbon paste (50% wt) were from Shanghai Zaofu New Material Technology Co. Ltd. Lead target (Pb, 99.99%) was purchased from Beijing Gaodewei Metal Technology Co. Ltd.
2.2 Pretreatment of FTO substrates
The etching of FTO glass substrates was performed by ultrasonic cleaning with detergent and deionized water for about 30 min. Subsequently, the FTO glass substrate was immersed in acetone solution and ultrasonic treatment was continued for 30 min. The treatment of FTO glass substrate was performed by using ultrasonic treatment again with deionized water for 20 min, followed by drying it at 80 °C and 30 min ultraviolet ozone treating.
2.3 Synthesis of SnO2 QDs
The synthesis of SnO2 QDs was fabricated according to ref. 22.
2.4 Fabrication of CsPbBr3 films
Firstly, a SnO2 QD layer was deposited onto FTO glass by spin-coating at 2000 rpm for 30 s and annealing in air at 200 °C for 1 h. CsPbBr3 perovskite films were prepared by direct metal surface element reaction (DMSER), as shown in Fig. 1(a). All the processes were conducted in air atmosphere without humidity control. The FTO/SnO2 substrates were cleaned by UV light for 30 min before the deposition of the perovskite film. Then 20 nm, 40 nm and 60 nm of Pb were successively deposited on FTO/SnO2 substrates by using a Pb target. This process was conducted in a DC magnetron sputtering system (EMITECH K575X) with a base pressure of 4 × 10−4 Pa. Due to the sputtering system itself, the actual thicknesses of Pb layers are about 21.05 nm, 44.48 nm, and 64.10 nm (see S1†). A concentration of 0.1 M CsBr/HBr in methanol solution (nCsBr:nHBr = 1:2) was spin-coated on the deposited Pb layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s and annealed in air at 250 °C for 15 min, and afforded CsPbBr3 films. This process was repeated n times (n = 2, 4, and 6, corresponding to 20 nm, 40 nm and 60 nm Pb layers, respectively).

2.5 Device assembly
A concentration of 10 mg mL−1 P3HT/chlorobenzene solution was deposited on FTO/SnO2/CsPbBr3 films by spin-coating at 2500 rpm for 60 s. The carbon electrode was deposited by doctor-blade coating of carbon paste.
2.6 Characterization
The crystal structures were characterized by an X-ray powder diffractometer (Bruker D8-Advanced) with a Cu Kα (λ = 1.54056 Å, 40 kV, 40 mA) source at a scanning step of 0.02°. The morphologies of the samples were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Nova NanoSEM 50) at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. The UV-visible spectrum was recorded by the Carry 5000 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer. The steady-state photo luminescence (PL) measurements were performed on an F4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 400 nm. A 355 nm pulse laser was used as a light source to excite the CsPbBr3 films and the voltage signals were recorded by an oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS 3054C, 500 MHz). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were evaluated by a CHI660E electrochemical station in the frequency range from 106 to 1 Hz. The J–V plots were measured under AM 1.5G simulated solar illumination (100 mW cm−2, Newport Model 91150V, USA). The light intensity was calibrated with a standard Si solar cell for 1 sun.
3. Results and discussion
The schematic diagram shows the fabrication procedure of the CsPbBr3 film (Fig. 1a). The gradient thicknesses (20 nm, 40 nm and 60 nm) of Pb films were prepared by controlling the sputtering conditions. The diverse CsPbBr3 films (20 nm Pb@CsPbBr3, 40 nm Pb@CsPbBr3 and 60 nm Pb@CsPbBr3) were obtained by reacting different thicknesses of Pb precursors with CsBr/HBr in the methanol solution (see the Experimental section for details). The phase transition dynamics can be expressed by 2 reactions as follows: Pb + 2HBr + CsBr → CsPb2Br5 + H2↑(1) CsPb2Br5 + CsBr → 2CsPbBr3(2)In reaction (1), Pb can react with HBr and CsBr to form CsPb2Br5. And then the final CsPbBr3 can be produced in the second reaction. In fact, based on the experiment, reaction (1) cannot proceed and there is no product obtained. Additionally, adding some HBr can not only promote the reaction smoothly, but also increase the solubility of CsBr in methanol because of the presence of water molecules in the HBr solution.25 The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of CsPbBr3 show the diffraction peaks at 15.2°, 21.6°, 30.7°, 34.5°, and 44.1°, which were assigned to the (100), (110), (200), (210), and (220) planes, respectively (Fig. 1b). This XRD pattern of CsPbBr3 (20 nm Pb@CsPbBr3 and 40 nm Pb@CsPbBr3) could be indexed as pure cubic CsPbBr3 (space group: Pm3m), in agreement with ref. 23 and 24. However, with an excess of Pb thickness (about 60 nm), two obvious peaks around 11.7° and 24.1° were observed in the XRD patterns of 60 nm Pb@CsPbBr3, which are in accordance with the tetragonal CsPb2Br5 (PDF code: 25-211). This result indicates that Pb could react with HBr and CsBr to form CsPb2Br5 (the reaction (1)). In fact, the formation of the CsPb2Br5 intermediate also depends on the excess of the Pb amount which was demonstrated in many literature studies.7,24,26,27
To eliminate the possible effects of physical sputtering modes, the comparison experiment was carried out. From the SEM images in Fig. S2,† the SnO2 layer does not show any changes before and after sputtering Pb films, which indicates that the physical sputtering method has little influence on the thickness of the SnO2 QD layer. Fig. 2 shows the surface and cross-section SEM images of CsPbBr3 fabricated by sputtering different Pb layer thicknesses on the FTO/SnO2 substrates. As shown in Fig. 2a–c, the morphology of CsPbBr3 varies with the thickness of Pb. In the case of the average grain size of CsPbBr3, it is found that the average sizes of 500 nm, 1000 nm and 800 nm are corresponding to 20 nm Pb@CsPbBr3, 40 nm Pb@CsPbBr3 and 60 nm Pb@CsPbBr3, respectively. For the 20 nm Pb@CsPbBr3, there are many voids between the crystal grains, and the actual thickness of the CsPbBr3 formation is very thin (about 120 nm) from the cross section SEM image (Fig. 2d), which implies that there is not enough crystal grain formation due to the lack of Pb (Fig. 2a). When the thickness of Pb is up to 40 nm, the morphology of 40 nm Pb@CsPbBr3 with the actual thickness about 250 nm is uniform and close-grained, which are beneficial to the separation of charge from holes and electron transfer (Fig. 2b and e).19,28,29 However, the SEM image of 60 nm Pb@CsPbBr3 shows the uneven distribution of CsPbBr3 crystal grains, and there are some small sizes of crystal grains among the big crystal grains (Fig. 2c). Based on the distribution of excessive crystals from the cross section view (Fig. 2f), the cross section shows roughness due to the uneven surface of CsPbBr3. Simultaneously, some pinholes emerged in the 60 nm Pb films, which has a negative impact on the performance of materials and devices.

UV-vis spectroscopy and PL measurements were conducted to understand the optical properties of the CsPbBr3 perovskite films. Fig. 3a shows that all the CsPbBr3 films have wide absorption in the visible light region and the largest absorption at 516 nm. The optical band gaps of the CsPbBr3 films were calculated using a Tauc-plot method (Fig. 3a, inset). Accordingly, the band gaps of 20 nm Pb@CsPbBr3, 40 nm Pb@CsPbBr3 and 60 nm Pb@CsPbBr3 were all calculated as 2.3 eV, which is consistent with the reported literature.5,23,26,30Fig. 3b shows the steady-state photoluminescence spectra of the CsPbBr3 films with the excitation wavelength at 400 nm and the emission peak position at 529 nm. A higher PL intensity is always related to fewer traps or defects owing to the CsPbBr3 perovskites being directly deposited on FTO substrates without a charge transport layer.30,31 40 nm Pb@CsPbBr3 showed the highest emission intensity compared to 20 nm Pb@CsPbBr3 and 60 nm Pb@CsPbBr3, which indicates that the 40 nm Pb@CsPbBr3 films have the best photoelectric quality with the highest number of photogenerated carriers.28,32,33 In other words, the 40 nm Pb@CsPbBr3 films have the highest photo-generated carrier efficiency and less carrier recombination at defects.

The transient surface photovoltage (TSPV) was measured to further study the photoinduced charge carrier dynamics of the CsPbBr3 films, such as charge carrier lifetime and transfer, charge transport direction and semiconductor conductivity type.34 The sample surface was irradiated by using a pulse laser with a wavelength of 355 nm (Fig. 4). The positive TSPV signals of all CsPbBr3 films indicate that they are n-type semiconductors due to the accumulation of photoinduced holes at the surface. The time values of maximum photovoltage (Tt) of 20 nm Pb@CsPbBr3, 40 nm Pb@CsPbBr3 and 60 nm Pb@CsPbBr3 are about 9.0 × 10−7 s, 9.0 × 10−7 s, and 1.7 × 10−6 s. And the complete recombination time (Tr) values are about 1.8 × 10−3 s, 4.9 × 10−3 s, and 3.0 × 10−3 s. The Tt values of 20 nm Pb@CsPbBr3 and 40 nm Pb@CsPbBr3 are almost the same. However the Tr value of 40 nm Pb@CsPbBr3 is larger than that of 20 nm Pb@CsPbBr3, implying easier interface charge recombination of 20 nm Pb@CsPbBr3 due to its discrete morphology. The Tt value of 60 nm Pb@CsPbBr3 is larger than those of 20 nm Pb@CsPbBr3 and 40 nm Pb@CsPbBr3, suggesting the hysteresis effect of 60 nm Pb@CsPbBr3 related to its morphology.35 In a word, 40 nm Pb@CsPbBr3 has a lower charge carrier recombination ability and better charge transfer owing to its pure phase and close-grained morphology.

Charge transfer plays an important role in solar cell devices. The thickness and crystal quality of the CsPbBr3 films will influence the charge transfer from CsPbBr3 to a FTO substrate. Therefore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to evaluate the impendence in CsPbBr3 solar cells (Fig. 5). The low frequency semicircle indicates the recombination process of interface charge, which is represented by recombination resistance (Rrec) and chemical capacitance (Crec). Rrec is a crucial parameter to evaluate the charge recombination behavior of PSCs. A large Rrec indicates a low charge recombination rate of PSCs.26,31,32 The Rrec of 20 nm Pb@CsPbBr3, 40 nm Pb@CsPbBr3 and 60 nm Pb@CsPbBr3 are 2570.8 Ω, 9582.6 Ω and 16335.4 Ω, respectively. The Rrec value of 40 nm Pb@CsPbBr3 is much higher than those of other CsPbBr3 PSCs, indicating that 40 nm Pb@CsPbBr3 has the lowest charge recombination in the interface between electron transport layers and absorption layers owing to its excellent morphology.36,37

The CsPbBr3/carbon-based PSCs were fabricated as shown in Fig. 6. The PSCs had a device structure of FTO/dense SnO2/inorganic perovskite CsPbBr3/P3HT/carbon (electrode). The cross-sectional SEM morphology is of the CsPbBr3 sandwich device. The functional layers include the SnO2 electron-transporting layer (ETL), CsPbBr3 absorber, P3HT hole-transporting layer (HTL) and carbon electrode. It can be seen from the literature that the energy levels of each layer are matched (see Fig. S3†). It is worth nothing that the blend layer was formed by dissolving P3HT in the CsPbBr3 absorber.

To evaluate solar cell performance, the J–V plots were measured in the forward and reverse scanning modes under simulated solar illumination (100 mW cm−2) with a calibrated light intensity of 1 sun. The J–V curve and photovoltaic parameters are shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 7a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the champion PSCs comprising 20 nm Pb@CsPbBr3, 40 nm Pb@CsPbBr3 and 60 nm Pb@CsPbBr3 at the reverse scan. The 20 nm Pb@CsPbBr3 device exhibits a low PCE of 1.47% as well as an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.61 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 5.89 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.41. The optimized efficiency of the 40 nm Pb@CsPbBr3 device is 4.08%, VOC is 1.08 V, JSC is 7.94 mA cm−2, and FF is 0.48. For the device based on 60 nm Pb@CsPbBr3, the PCE decreases to 1.62% with a VOC of 0.88 V, a JSC of 4.85 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.39. The reproducibility of the experiment plays a crucial role in the performance evaluation of solar cells. To demonstrate the reproducibility, at least 15 experiments were carried out to make a series of comparison charts about VOC, JSC, FF and PCE parameters (Fig. S4,†Table 1). The average PCEs of 20 nm Pb@CsPbBr3, 40 nm Pb@CsPbBr3 and 60 nm Pb@CsPbBr3 are 1.29 ± 0.18%, 3.56 ± 0.52% and 1.53 ± 0.09%, respectively. The 40 nm Pb@CsPbBr3 device has the champion performance owing to the excellent values of VOC, JSC and FF, which are closely related to its super phase purity, remarkable crystallinity and notable light absorption intensity.30 The PCE measured in the reverse scan was 4.08% and 3.83% in the forward scan direction, which reflects a certain hysteretic behaviour derived from a perovskite absorbed layer into the ETL and HTL, respectively.29,30 Accordingly, the performance of the 40 nm Pb@CsPbBr3 device is related to its pure phase and remarkable morphology.

The stability of PSCs is also a critical criterion for performance evaluation. To examine the long-term stability of PSCs, we tested the PCEs of unencapsulated CsPbBr3 devices stored in ambient air with a humidity of ∼40% at 25 °C. The PCEs of 20 nm Pb@CsPbBr3, 40 nm Pb@CsPbBr3 and 60 nm Pb@CsPbBr3 solar cells decayed in 30 days are shown in Fig. 8. It is found that the PCE is still above 95% of the initial PCE after 30 days. And there is little difference in all the PCE decay curves of 20 nm Pb@CsPbBr3, 40 nm Pb@CsPbBr3 and 60 nm Pb@CsPbBr3. Thus, CsPbBr3 solar cells show good environment stability in ambient air.

4. Conclusion
In summary, we reported an in situ metal reaction strategy to fabricate single phase CsPbBr3 perovskite films by reacting Pb precursors a the mixture of CsBr and HBr. The purity of the CsPbBr3 film is controlled by tuning the thickness of sputtered Pb. In particular, the secondary crystal phase of CsPb2Br5 could be removed completely by varying the thickness of sputtered Pb films. And the single phase 40 nm Pb@CsPbBr3 solar cell exhibits a higher PCE than other heterogeneous CsPbBr3 solar cells.
