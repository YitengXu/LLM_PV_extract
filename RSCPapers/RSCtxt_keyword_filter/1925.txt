    , Accepted 27th September 2021First published on 28th September 2021AbstractSince the emerging development of CsPbBr3 perovskite, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has become one of the most promising fabrication techniques by which to precisely deposit uniform perovskite thin films. However, there have been few reports on the growth dynamics and chemical reaction parameters (e.g., activation energy) for perovskite CVD. In this work, different deposition rates of CVD-grown CsPbBr3 thin films were obtained at different substrate temperatures. Dynamics equations were developed to relate the inflow rates, desorption coefficients and concentrations of reactants on the substrates. Only a small amount of reactant became activated at low temperature and a small amount of PbBr2 resided on the substrate at high temperature, and accordingly the maximal deposition rate was achieved at 250 °C. The Arrhenius activation energy of CVD-grown CsPbBr3 was also calculated, and found to be 31.64 kJ mol−1. We believe that our work provides a detailed picture of perovskite CVD growth.
Introduction
Since lead-halide perovskite (APbX3) was first demonstrated in 2009,1 this materials system has been extensively studied and applied in solar cells,2,3 light-emitting devices,4,5 photo detectors,6 lasers,7etc. During the decade since, the certified power conversion efficiency levels of perovskite solar cell have surged to 25%.8 Of all of the lead-halide perovskites, CsPbBr3 has been recognized to be promising for producing bright green emitters, due to its environmental stability, strong exciton oscillation and high efficiency.9–11 Although spin coating is currently widely adopted to synthesize CsPbBr3,12 the sensitivity of the environment to CsPbBr3 and the inability to achieve a mass production of CsPbBr3 in this manner have hindered industrialization of this technique. Meanwhile, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a widely accepted method for mass-producing semiconductor thin films in a controllable fabrication, due to its vacuum process and high precision. In the last few years, several works on CVD-grown CsPbBr3 have been reported.13–15 However, to date, there have been very few reports providing an in-depth understanding of CsPbBr3 CVD dynamics. The physical modes (e.g., source transportation and reaction mechanism) of this fabrication have not been developed. Therefore, in this work, CsPbBr3 thin films were grown using CVD systems with two heater zones, at substrate temperatures of 30 °C to 300 °C. Dynamics equations of the reactants CsBr and PbBr2 were calculated. Parameters including inflow of reactants, desorption coefficient, and concentrations of reactants on the substrates were derived. The highest deposition rate was achieved at a 250 °C substrate temperature. The lower deposition rates at temperatures lower than 250 °C were apparently due to limited reaction coefficients at such temperatures, whereas the lower deposition rates at temperatures higher than 250 °C were apparently due to the higher PbBr2 desorption coefficients at such temperatures. The activation energy (31.64 kJ mol−1) of the chemical reaction in the CVD system was also derived.
Experimental
Two individual furnaces were deployed as heat reactors using a 1:1 molar ratio of CsBr to PbBr2 and quartz substrates, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1. A temperature of 500 °C was used to sublimate the sources, while various temperatures (30, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300 °C) were used for the quartz substrates. Nitrogen at 30 sccm was used as the carrier gas to transport the reactants onto the substrates. During growth, CsBr reacted with PbBr2 to form CsPbBr3, along with desorption from substrates as a result of thermal vibration. A pressure of 1300 Pa was set by using the valve between the vacuum pump and reactor chamber. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) phase analysis (2θ ∼ ω) with 2θ from 10°–32° was performed using a Bruker-AXS X-ray diffractometer. Surface scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were acquired by using a Carl Zeiss apparatus (Sigma-HD). Thicknesses of deposition thin films were measured by using a step profiler (Bruker Dektak-XT). A photoluminescence (PL) spectrum was recorded by using an Andor spectrograph and charge-coupled device (CCD) excited by a 405 nm-wavelength continuous wave laser. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were collected using an Escalab Xi+ apparatus (Thermo Fisher).
After 20 minutes of CVD growth, CsPbBr3 thin films were deposited on quartz substrates. Fig. 2 shows the phase analysis and PL spectrum of typical CsPbBr3 thin films. As shown in Fig. 2a, all materials deposited using CVD appeared as an almost pure CsPbBr3(110) phase, showing no parasitic products (e.g., Cs4PbBr6 or CsPb2Br5). Under 405 nm-wavelength laser excitation, the CsPbBr3 films emitted green light centered at 532 nm in the PL spectrum. Chemical stoichiometric ratio here was confirmed using XPS, as shown in (ESI†). Average crystalline size, dislocation density and strain of perovskite could be calculated based on the diffraction angle and width of XRD curves.16–18 As shown in ESI,† CsPbBr3 thin films deposited at 200 °C displayed the lowest dislocation density.

Fig. 3 shows the surface morphologies of CsPbBr3 films visualized using SEM. Under high magnification (1000×), the CsPbBr3 thin films appeared to be uniform and compact. As the temperature was increased to 250 °C, the grain size of CsPbBr3 gradually increased, as shown in the inset. CsPbBr3 grown at 30 °C and 300 °C both showed small discrete crystal particles. However, different morphologies resulted from the use of different substrate temperatures. As the substrate temperature is varied from 30 °C to 300 °C, the chemical reaction, diffusion and desorption coefficients of the reactants all diverge, inducing different crystal grains and deposition rates. A step profiler was used to measure the thicknesses of the deposited films for the purpose of calculating deposition rates. Step scanning profiles are shown in Fig. 3e. CsPbBr3 films deposited at 250 °C were thickest, with a thickness of 420 nm.
CVD is a hybrid deposition system, involving sublimation and mass transport of reactants, diffusion of sources towards substrates, chemical reactions, surface desorption, etc. Any of these processes may impact the final thin films. Therefore, in this work, we considered three main processes—namely the inflow of reactants, the chemical reaction, and the desorption of sources—occurring on the substrate to interpret the experimental deposition rates R at various temperatures.
The dynamics processes for CsBr and PbBr2 on substrate are illustrated in Fig. 1, and could be expressed as (1)The reactant inflow (I) was consumed either by desorption (α) or deposition (R). The rate of inflow of the reactants was determined from the diffusion coefficient (D), diffusion boundary thickness (δ) and concentrations of the source on the substrate (nsub) and in the chamber (nc) by using the equation (2)The reactant concentration (nc) in the chamber was calculated based on the gas/liquid phase equilibrium equation  and ideal gas state equation PV = nRT. In these equations, ΔvapHm and R denote the molar vaporization enthalpy and molar gas constant, respectively, Pc and Tc denote, respectively, the pressure and temperature in the chamber (with Tc set to 500 °C), and (P1,T1) denotes any known vaporization point on the phase equilibrium line. The diffusion coefficient (D) could be calculated by using the equation , where  and  denote the mean velocity and diffusion length of the reactant, parameters related to temperature, molecular mass and reactant concentration. Diffusion layer thickness δ was determined from the substrate length L and Reynolds value Re by using the equation .19 A detailed description and consideration of nc, D and δ are provided in ESI.†

The coefficient of desorption (α) of reactant from substrate was ascribed to the thermal vibration of molecules. Based on the Lindemann criterion,20 molecules (CsBr and PbBr2) were considered to have desorbed from the substrate when their displacements exceeded 1/10 of the lattice distance. In this work, we estimated the desorption coefficient21 by using the equation (3)where f(T,m) and lsf denote the vibration frequency and sublimation enthalpy, respectively. The expression for f(T,m) is provided in ESI.†
The chemical reaction CsBr + PbBr2 = CsPbBr3 occurred on the substrate. In eqn (1), the deposition rate (R) was derived from the experimentally measured thickness. Meanwhile, R was determined theoretically from reaction constant A, the activation energy of the chemical reaction Ea, and the concentration of the reactants residing on the substrate22 by using the equation (4)In this work, we first used the experimental SEM and step profiler data to calculate the deposition rate , where d denotes the deposition thickness measured using the stepper, t denotes the deposition time (20 minutes), and μ denotes the coverage ratio of perovskite determined using SEM. The concentrations of reactants on the substrate (nsubCsBr and ), desorption coefficients and inflow rates were then calculated by using eqn (1). By obtaining nsubCsBr and  at different substrate temperatures, the chemical activation energy was also deduced using eqn (4). Some key parameters used in the calculation are listed in Table 1.

Fig. 4 shows the variation of deposition rates, concentrations of reactants on substrate, and inflow and desorption coefficients for substrate temperatures ranging from 30 °C to 300 °C. The reaction rate peaked at 250 °C, as shown in Fig. 4d. That is, either increasing or decreasing the temperature from this value reduced the deposition rate. This observation could be ascribed to two factors: (1) at low temperature, although nsubCsBr and  were high (as shown in Fig. 4a), the chemical reaction rate was limited by temperature with ; (2) at high temperature,  was significantly attenuated, which reduced the reaction rate by .

As shown in Fig. 4a, nsubCsBr remained nearly constant with increasing substrate temperature, while  gradually decreased to a trace amount. nsubCsBr and  were related to inflow and desorption. As shown in Fig. 4b, the inflow of PbBr2 (IPbBr2) was much greater than that of CsBr (ICsBr) when the temperature exceeded 150 °C. This result may have been due to a couple of factors: (1) the lower vaporization temperature and sublimation enthalpy of PbBr2 (917 °C@1atom and 20.75 kJ mol−1) than of CsBr (1300 °C@1atom and 23.64 kJ mol−1), with this factor having made  nearly double ncCsBr at 300 °C; and (2) a higher diffusion coefficient of PbBr2 (0.4 cm2 s−1) than of CsBr (0.0395 cm2 s−1) at 300 °C, with this factor facilitating diffusion of PbBr2 into the substrate.
However, the PbBr2 desorption coefficient (i.e., αPbBr2) was about 4 to 7 orders of magnitude greater than the CsBr desorption coefficient (αCsBr), which led to low values of  at high temperatures. The much greater desorption of PbBr2 than of CsBr resulted from the lower sublimation enthalpy lsf of PbBr2 (136.7 kJ mol−1) than of CsBr (174.3 kJ mol−1). It is worth noting that in our calculation, some parameters (e.g., diffusion velocity and diffusion layer thickness δ of carrier gas) were related to the furnace geometry, while major parameters were not. Therefore, our simulation presented a general in-depth picture of the CVD mechanism.
According to the Arrhenius theory, a chemical reaction needs to overcome an activation energy Ea to achieve the resultant product. Considering the derived nsubCsBr,  and deposition rate, Ea of the CVD-grown CsPbBr3 reaction (CsBr + PbBr2 = CsPbBr3) could be deduced using eqn (4), as shown in Fig. 4e. The Ea was determined from fitting to be 328.5 ± 51.5 meV (31.64 ± 15.6 kJ mol−1). The enthalpy of formation of CsPbBr3 from CsBr and PbBr2 was determined to be −11.82 kJ mol−1,24 and this information was used to draw the energy level diagram of the CVD reaction as shown in the inset to Fig. 4e. The reaction apparently first overcame an activation energy of 31.64 kJ mol−1, and then released 43.46 kJ mol−1 of energy to form CsPbBr3.
Conclusions
In this work, pure CsPbBr3 perovskite thin films were deposited on quartz substrates at various temperatures using CVD. The highest deposition rate was observed at a 250 °C substrate temperature. Equations of CsBr and PbBr2 on the substrate were derived to investigate the CVD dynamics, and considered the inflow, desorption and chemical reaction processes. At temperatures lower than 250 °C, the deposition rates were limited by the chemical reaction coefficient with an activation energy Ea = 31.64 ± 15.6 kJ mol−1. At temperatures higher than 250 °C, the deposition rate was constrained by high desorption coefficient of PbBr2 due its lower sublimation enthalpy. Our work has provided an in-depth picture for perovskite CVD growth, benefiting further optimization of and research into this technique.
