The discrepancy of the electron transport properties of C60-n-Py is primarily due to the difference in the coordination interaction between the pyridine moiety and the Pb2+ ion of the MAPbI3 perovskite layer, which is determined by the nitrogen site according to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) characterization and theoretical studies. The stronger coordination interaction between the pyridine moiety and the Pb2+ ion for the C60-3-Py-based device leads to reinforced passivation of the trap state within the MAPbI3 perovskite film, affording improved device performance and ambient stability of the C60-3-Py device.

Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been attracting increasing attention due to the advantages of organometal halide perovskite light absorbers in terms of high carrier mobility, tunable band gaps, large absorption coefficients and long charge carrier diffusion lengths.1–3 Up to now, the record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has reached 25.2%,4 which is competitive with those of the commercial crystalline-Si and inorganic semiconductor thin film solar cells. To further boost the PSC device performance, optimizing the device structure and/or engineering the composition, phase and morphology of the perovskite light absorber and the perovskite/electrode interface have been implemented.5–9 Among them, interface engineering fulfilled by incorporating the interfacial materials between the perovskite light absorber and electrode has been demonstrated to be determinative for efficient charge transport and extraction.9,10
Inverted (p–i–n) planar heterojunction PSCs (iPSCs) featuring an incorporated electron transport layer (ETL) between the perovskite layer and cathode are one of the commonly used structures owing to the advantages of the low-temperature solution processibility and negligible current–voltage hysteresis.9–12 The ETL plays crucial roles in promoting electron transport and extraction, adjusting the energy level alignment of devices and passivating trap states in perovskite.9,11 In particular, zero-dimensional nanocarbon materials, such as fullerene derivatives, featuring strong electron-accepting ability have been extensively used as the ETLs of iPSCs.11–14 So far, the most commonly used ETL of iPSCs is [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), which was first utilized in 201315 but suffers from high cost due to the complicated synthetic route. In order to lower the cost of the ETL of iPSCs, developing novel fullerene derivatives ideally via a one-step reaction is highly desired.14,16 For example, in 2016 Echegoyen et al. reported a novel fullerene derivative, 2,5-(dimethyl ester) C60 fulleropyrrolidine (DMEC60), synthesized via a one-step 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction, which was used as the ETL of iPSCs affording a PCE of 15.2%, which is higher than that of PC61BM (14.5%).17 Recently Chen et al. synthesized N-methyl-2-pentyl-[60]fullerenepyrrolidine (NMPFP) via a similar Prato reaction and used it as the ETL, delivering a comparable PCE (13.83%) to that of PCBM (13.87%).18 Note that, similar to PC61BM, for these fullerene derivatives the commonly employed functional groups are mainly ester and carboxyl groups, which render weak coordination interactions with the perovskite layer; thus their effects on boosting the device performance are limited.17–21 In 2016, Yip et al. grafted electron-rich oligoether chains onto fullerene derivatives and achieved significant PCE improvements compared with that of the PCBM-based device, indicating the important effect of Lewis base-acid O–Pb2+ interaction between the fullerene derivatives and perovskite on trap state passivation and device performance enhancement.22 Very recently, Echegoyen et al. synthesized several thiophene-functionalized fullerene derivatives containing one or two thiophene moieties via Bingel reactions and used them as the ETLs of iPSCs, obtaining a PCE of 17.77%, which is higher than that of PCBM (15.74%) due to the stronger ability of the thiophene moiety to passivate the trap states of perovskite induced by the interactions between S and Pb atoms.23 At the same time, we synthesized pyridine-functionalized fullerene derivatives (C60-Py) bearing different alkyl chains (methyl, butyl, and hexyl) and found that the grafted pyridine moiety had strong coordination interactions with the Pb2+ ion of the perovskite, consequently reinforcing the passivation of the trap states within the perovskite film and enhancing the electron transport of the C60-Py ETL. As a result, the C60-Py-based ETL exhibited the highest PCE of 16.83%, surpassing that of the PCBM-based device (15.87%).24 In these studies, the electron transport properties of the fullerene derivative is optimized by varying the number of functional groups or the length of the side chain; however the effect of the specific heteroatom (sulfur or nitrogen) site within the fullerene derivative on its electron transport properties has scarcely been studied. Since the heteroatom site within the functional group is decisive for the molecular packing, which consequently influences the interactions between the fullerene derivative and the bottom perovskite layer, the heteroatom site intrinsically determines the electron transport properties of the fullerene derivative.
Herein, we designed and synthesized three new pyridine-functionalized fullerene derivatives with variable nitrogen sites (abbreviated as C60-n-Py, where n is the relative position of pyridine nitrogen with the site of pyridine moieties linked to the pyrrolidine ring of fullerene derivatives, n = 2 (ortho-), 3 (meta-), 4 (para-)) via a one-step 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction. The molecular structures of C60-n-Py as well as their molecular packing were unambiguously determined by single crystal X-ray crystallography, and the effects of the nitrogen site on the molecular energy level and optical absorption were investigated. C60-n-Py were used as novel ETLs of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) iPSC devices, and their ETL performance was sensitively dependent on the nitrogen site, with the C60-3-Py-based device showing the highest PCE. The reasons for the discrepancy of the electron transport properties of C60-n-Py are elucidated, revealing the role of the nitrogen site in the coordination interaction between the pyridine moiety and the Pb2+ ion of the MAPbI3 perovskite layer. Finally, the universality of our approach in steering the electron transport properties of C60-n-Py was studied by employing C60-n-Py as the ETLs of Cs0.05FA0.83MA0.12PbI2.55Br0.45 (abbreviated as CsFAMA) iPSC devices, and C60-3-Py showed the best ETL performance as well.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and structural characterization of C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4)
C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4) with different nitrogen sites were synthesized via a facile one-step 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction (i.e., Prato reaction) between pyridinecarboxaldehydes bearing different nitrogen sites, C60 and N-butyl glycine as shown in Scheme 1.24 After purification via a silicon column, C60-2-Py, C60-3-Py and C60-4-Py exhibit comparable yields of 33.5%, 35.7% and 34.6%, respectively. Nevertheless, the solubilities of C60-2-Py, C60-3-Py, and C60-4-Py in chlorobenzene are ca. 9, 16 and 32 mg ml−1, respectively, indicating that the nitrogen site sensitively affects the solubility of C60-n-Py.
 Scheme 1  The synthetic routes to C60-2-Py, C60-3-Py and C60-4-Py. 
We characterized the chemical structures of C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4) by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. According to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, C60-2-Py, C60-3-Py and C60-4-Py all show dominant ionic peaks at m/z = 896 attributed to the monoadducts along with the decomposed signals of C60 due to laser irradiation (see ESI Fig S1†). The 1H NMR spectra of C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4) show the characteristic proton signals of the n-butyl group and pyrrolidine ring in the regions of 1.05–3.24 and 4.15–5.48 ppm, respectively. The proton signals of the pyridine moiety in C60-n-Py were observed in the region of 7.33–9.06 ppm, and the pyridine nitrogen site is found to affect the chemical shift of the neighboring aryl proton signals (see ESI Fig S2†). Furthermore, in the 13C NMR spectra of C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4), the sp3 carbon signals in the high-field range of 14.35–53.30 ppm were assigned to the n-butyl group, while the sp3-carbon signals assigned to the –CH– and –CH2– moieties within the pyrrolidine ring and the carbon atoms at the addition sites of the C60 cage were detected in the range of 66.80–83.06 ppm. In particular, the sp2-carbon signals of the pyridine ring having an obviously higher peak intensity overlap with those of the C60 cage in the range of 124.1–155.9 ppm confirming the successful synthesis of the fullerene derivatives C60-n-BPy with different pyridine nitrogen sites. In particular, the different positions of the sp2 carbon signals of the pyridine rings in the range of 124.1–155.9 ppm and the sp3 carbon atom (h carbon atom marked in Fig. S3†) of the –CH– moieties in the pyrrolidine ring in the range of 79.97–83.06 ppm further confirm the successful synthesis of the C60-n-Py fullerene derivatives with different nitrogen atom spatial positions (see ESI Fig. S3†).
FT-IR spectroscopic measurements of C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4) were then carried out to verify the successful addition of the pyridine moiety onto the C60 cage (see ESI Fig. S4†). In addition to the characteristic vibrational peaks of C60 at 1463 and 526 cm−1, the vibrational signals at 1177 cm−1 are assigned to the stretching vibrations of the C–N bonds within the pyrrolidine moiety of C60-n-Py, while those at 2924–2954 and 826 cm−1 are assigned to the C–H stretching vibration and out-of-plane bending vibration of the n-butyl group, respectively. Besides, the peaks at 1586–1597 assigned to the CN vibration of the pyridine moiety are obviously different, indicating the successful synthesis of the C60-n-Py fullerene derivatives with different nitrogen sites.
We next determined unambiguously the molecular structures of C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4) by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Crystal data of C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4) show that the pyridine moieties were grafted onto carbon cages with [6,6]-closed addition pattern which were confirmed by the bond lengths of [6,6]-bonds between two addition sites in the range of 1.539–1.615 Å. The C–C bond lengths of C1–C61 and C2–C62 were located in the range of 1.576–1.715 Å and 1.565–1.703 Å, respectively, featuring their carbon–carbon single bonds. The C–N bond lengths of C61–N1 and C62–N1 were in the range of 1.288–1.545 Å, showing the conventional C–N single bond characteristics. Comparing the three structures of C60-n-Py, we clearly observed that C60-2-Py and C60-4-Py have similar spatial configurations, which were different from that of C60-3-Py, predicating the possibility of different crystal packing. Moreover, the crystal packings of C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4) are compared in Fig. 1d–f, clearly showing their difference in molecular packing induced by the different nitrogen sites within the pyridine moiety. The crystal packing of C60-n-Py shows that the distance between adjacent carbon cages are 10.037 and 7.368 Å for C60-2-Py, 11.298, 9.052 and 9.728 Å for C60-3-Py, and 10.334 and 7.292 Å for C60-4-Py, respectively. The shortest distance between carbon cages for C60-2-Py (7.368 Å), C60-3-Py (9.052) and C60-4-Py (7.292 Å) indicates that C60-4-Py has the best electron transport ability followed by C60-2-Py and C60-3-Py due to the strong molecular interaction. Because of the electron transfer from the pyridine moiety to the fullerene cage reported in ref. 25, pyridine moieties in C60-n-Py play a bridging role to transport electrons, facilitating the electron transfer in the ETL. As for the distance between the pyridine moiety and adjacent carbon cage, C60-3-Py has the shortest distance of 7.165 Å relative to that of C60-2-Py (8.947 Å) and C60-4-Py (11.919 Å). Comparing the distances of carbon cage-carbon cage and pyridine moiety-carbon cage, C60-3-Py with the shortest distance of 7.165 Å predicates the stronger molecular interaction in the assembly state, which consequently affects the ability of the fullerene channels to conduct electrons and improve electron mobility.26

Thermal stabilities and molecular energy levels of C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4)
Given that the thermal stability of the fullerene derivative is a prerequisite for it to act as the ETL of iPSC devices for which thermal annealing is frequently needed, we further evaluated the thermal stability of C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4) through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements (see ESI Fig. S5†). The decomposition temperatures of the first weight-loss step, which correlates to the detachment of the functional groups of C60-n-Py, are 394.81 °C, 396.24 °C and 452.15 °C for C60-2-Py, C60-3-Py and C60-4-Py, respectively. Such high decomposition temperatures of C60-n-Py demonstrate their considerable thermal stability, fulfilling the requirements of iPSC device fabrication.
Suitable energy band alignment facilitates charge transport from the perovskite film to electrodes in PSC devices.9 In order to investigate the effect of the nitrogen site on the molecular energy level of C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4), we estimated the energy levels of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of C60-2-Py, C60-3-Py and C60-4-Py by cyclic voltammetry combined with UV-vis absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 2).23,24 The onset reduction potentials (Eredonset) of C60z-2-Py, C60-3-Py and C60-4-Py were determined to be −1.02, −1.00 V and −0.99 V vs. Fc+/Fc, corresponding to the LUMO energy levels of −3.78, −3.80 and −3.81 eV for C60-2-Py, C60-3-Py and C60-4-Py, respectively (see ESI Fig. S6 and Table S3†). According to the optical bandgaps correlated with the absorption onsets in the UV-vis spectra at 715, 724 and 724 nm for C60-2-Py, C60-3-Py and C60-4-Py (Fig. 2b), the corresponding HOMO energy levels of C60-2-Py, C60-3-Py and C60-4-Py are calculated to be −5.51, −5.51 and −5.52 eV, respectively. These results indicate that the nitrogen site has negligible influence on the molecular energy level and optical absorption of C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4). Besides, the energy levels of C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4) are also comparable to those of PCBM, ensuring their suitability as alternative ETLs in terms of energy band alignment with perovskite.17

ETL performance of C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4) in iPSC devices
To reveal the effect of the nitrogen site of C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4) on its ETL performance, we fabricated iPSC devices with an architecture of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/NiOx/MAPbI3/C60-n-Py/bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag (Fig. 3a), in which the NiOx film with a thickness of ∼20 nm as the HTL was prepared by a sol–gel process and the bathocuproine (BCP) layer with a thickness of ∼8 nm was thermally evaporated onto the ETL as a cathode buffer layer for hole transport blocking.27–29 Considering the dramatic solubility discrepancy of C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4) as mentioned above, for consistency we first fabricated C60-n-Py ETLs under exactly the same conditions (concentration of 9 mg ml−1 which is the saturation concentration of C60-2-Py, spin-coating speed of 1000 rpm, thickness of about 10 nm, see ESI Fig. S7†) so as to eliminate the influence of the ETL thickness. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the iPSC devices based on C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4) ETLs measured under one sun illumination are compared in Fig. S8,† and the obtained photovoltaic parameters including open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF), PCE, series resistance (Rs), and shunt resistance (Rsh) are summarized in Table S4.† Obviously the devices based on C60-3-Py and C60-4-Py ETLs exhibit higher PCE than the C60-2-Py-based device. This suggests that the nitrogen site sensitively affects the ETL performance of C60-n-Py.

(b) Cross-sectional SEM image of FTO/NiOx/MAPbI3/C60-3-Py. (c) J–V curves of the PCBM and C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4) ETL-based devices measured under illumination from an AM 1.5 solar simulator (100 mW cm−2) in air. The concentrations of PCBM, C60-2-Py, C60-3-Py and C60-4-Py are 20, 9, 20, and 16 mg ml−1, respectively. The scanning direction is from open-circuit voltage to short circuit (reverse). (d) EQE spectra of the PCBM and C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4) ETL-based devices measured in air. 
Since the PCEs of devices based on C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4) ETLs spin-coated from low-concentration solutions (9 mg ml−1) are lower than those reported for the PCBM ETL in the literature27,28 and the thickness of the ETL sensitively affects the device performance (see Table S4†), we optimized the thicknesses of C60-3-Py and C60-4-Py ETLs by increasing the concentrations of the chlorobenzene solution (20 and 16 mg ml−1 for C60-3-Py and C60-4-Py respectively, see ESI S10 and Table S6†).Under the optimized spin-coating speed, the thicknesses of the C60-3-Py and C60-4-Py ETLs are about 39.7 and 37.9 nm, respectively (see ESI Fig. S7 and Table S6†). Fig. 3b shows the cross-sectional scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the C60-3-Py-based device. Clearly, the MAPbI3 perovskite film with a thickness of ∼300 nm is compact and covered uniformly by a C60-3-Py film over a wide range. The corresponding J–V curves of the devices based on the C60-n-Py ETLs with optimized thicknesses are shown in Fig. 3c and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. Upon substituting C60-2-Py (device B) with the C60-3-Py (device C) ETL, the average PCE increases dramatically from 10.01% to 16.73%, resulting from the improvements of all the photovoltaic parameters (Voc from 0.97 to 1.02 V, Jsc from 18.24 to 21.99 mA cm−2, and FF from 56.76 to 74.33%). For the device based on the C60-4-Py ETL (device D), the PCE is lower than that of device C based on the C60-3-Py ETL due mainly to the decrease of FF, but is still much higher than that of C60-2-Py-based device B. These results confirm that the nitrogen site sensitively affects the ETL performance of C60-n-Py. Moreover, the best PCEs of the C60-3-Py- and C60-4-Py-based devices reach 17.57% and 16.51%, respectively, which surpass that of the PCBM-based device (15.89%), indicating the potential of C60-3-Py- and C60-4-Py in substituting the commonly used PCBM ETL.

The variation of photovoltaic parameters of C60-n-Py-based devices was further confirmed by analyzing the statistical data based on 30 devices fabricated independently (see ESI Fig. S11 and S12† for the box plots of each parameter and histogram of the PCE), revealing that the PCE improvements for the C60-3-Py and C60-4-Py ETLs relative to that of C60-2-Py primarily originated from the increases of both Jsc and FF.
We then carried out external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements for the devices based on the different ETLs so as to confirm their discrepancy of Jsc. As shown in Fig. 3d, the overall EQE response of the C60-n-Py-based device in the visible-light region of 400–700 nm and the integrated photocurrent density exhibit the trend of C60-3-Py > C60-4-Py > PCBM > C60-2-Py. This is consistent with the difference of their measured Jsc from J–V curves.
The current–voltage (J–V) hysteresis of the devices based on different C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4) ETLs was examined by measuring the J–V curves in different scan directions. Although p–i–n-structure iPSC devices with the PCBM ETL rarely exhibit J–V hysteresis of curves,30–32 obvious hysteresis with a relatively large hysteresis index of 10.65% is observed for the C60-2-Py-based device, suggesting the existence of traps in the perovskite layer as well as charge accumulation at the interface.33 For the C60-3-Py- and C60-4-Py based devices, however, negligible J–V hysteresis is observed (see ESI Fig. S13 and Table S7†). This confirms the discrepancy of C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4) in the electron transport behavior.
In order to reveal the dependence of the ETL performance on the nitrogen site of C60-n-Py, we carried out a series of morphological and spectroscopic characterization experiments. It is known that high-quality ETL films can decrease interfacial charge recombination and J–V hysteresis.34–37 We first compared the roughness and morphologies of MAPbI3/C60-n-Py films by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in the tapping mode (see ESI Fig. S14†). The pristine MAPbI3 perovskite film appears to be very compact and uniform with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 9.77 nm. After depositing C60-n-Py onto the MAPbI3 perovskite film, the RMS roughness of the MAPbI3/C60-n-Py film dramatically decreases to 5.10, 2.54, and 3.65 nm, indicating the improvement of film uniformity. Interestingly, the MAPbI3/C60-3-Py film exhibits the smallest roughness of 2.54 nm, which is also slightly smaller than that of the MAPbI3/PCBM film (2.83 nm). The smoothest film of MAPbI3/C60-3-Py originating from the optimized crystal packing enables better contact between the MAPbI3 perovskite layer and the C60-3-Py ETL,38 facilitates electron transport and consequently contributes to improved Jsc and FF. Contrarily, in the case of the C60-2-Py ETL, the MAPbI3/C60-2-Py film exhibits much lower coverage and obvious aggregation as well as a larger RMS roughness of 5.10 nm, resulting in inferior device performance and large J–V hysteresis (see Fig. S13†).
To analyze the interactions between the C60-n-Py ETL and the underlying MAPbI3 perovskite layer, we performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) measurements to check the change of the binding energy of the Pb2+ ion within MAPbI3 after depositing the C60-n-Py ETL. Comparing the high-resolution Pb 4f XPS spectra of the MAPbI3 perovskite films with and without C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4) ETLs, we found that the Pb 4f5/2 and Pb 4f7/2 signals at 143.35 and 138.50 eV detected for the pristine MAPbI3 perovskite film shift after incorporating the C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4) ETL, and interestingly the shifts are sensitively dependent on the nitrogen site. For the MAPbI3/C60-2-Py film, similar to the case of PCBM,24,39 both the Pb 4f5/2 and Pb 4f7/2 signals remain almost unshifted (Fig. 4a). However, after depositing C60-3-Py onto the MAPbI3 film, the Pb 4f5/2 and Pb 4f7/2 signals shift negatively to 142.81 and 137.96 eV, respectively. Upon changing to the C60-4-Py ETL, the Pb 4f5/2 and Pb 4f7/2 signals are observed at 142.98 and 138.12 eV, which are more negative than those for the pristine MAPbI3 perovskite film while the negative shifts are smaller than those for C60-3-Py. Since the negative shifts of the Pb 4f5/2 and Pb 4f7/2 binding energies have been confirmed to originate from the coordination interactions between the pyridine group and Pb2+ ions of the MAPbI3 perovskite,40–42 the largest negative shift for MAPbI3/C60-3-Py suggests that the coordination interactions between the pyridine group within C60-3-Py and Pb2+ ions is the strongest, whereas C60-2-Py barely has coordination interactions with Pb2+ ions. Likewise, the I 3d3/2 and I 3d5/2 signals of MAPbI3/C60-n-Py exhibit similar negative shifts to those of the pristine MAPbI3 film and C60-3-Py shows the largest negative shift as shown in Fig. 4b,43 confirming the strongest coordination interactions between the pyridine group within C60-3-Py and the Pb2+ ions of the MAPbI3 perovskite.
 Fig. 4  (a and b) XPS spectra of Pb 4f and I 3d signals of the MAPbI3 perovskite, MAPbI3/C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4), and MAPbI3/PCBM films. The vertical dotted lines show the shifts of the signal peaks. (c and d) Schematic diagrams of deposition of the C60-2-Py and C60-3-Py ETLs onto the MAPbI3 perovskite film via absorption on the MAPbI3 (110) surface. The DFT-calculated absorption energy (Eabs.) is given in brackets. 
To understand the influence of the nitrogen site of C60-n-Py on its coordination interactions with MAPbI3 perovskite theoretically, we calculated the absorption energy (Eabs) of C60-n-Py on the surface of MAPbI3 perovskite using density functional theory (DFT).44 The calculated Eabs values of C60-2-Py, C60-3-Py and C60-4-Py on the MAPbI3 perovskite surface are −31.64, −76.70 and −72.17 kJ mol−1, respectively (Fig. 4c–e). A more negative absorption energy means stronger coordination interaction of the pyridine moiety with Pb2+ ions, which reduces the steric hindrance between the fullerene derivative molecule and the perovskite layer, facilitating trap state passivation.45 Obviously, C60-3-Py and C60-4-Py both show more negative Eabs values than C60-2-Py and PCBM (−54.70 kJ mol−1).24 These results coincide with the sequence of the measured ETL performance of C60-n-Py, affirming the strongest coordination interactions between the pyridine group within C60-3-Py and the Pb2+ ions of the MAPbI3 perovskite. The difference in the coordination interactions between the pyridine group within C60-3-Py and Pb2+ ions is primarily due to the discrepancy of crystal packing induced by the different nitrogen sites as discussed above. C60-3-Py and C60-4-Py exhibit an interlaced arrangement between molecules whereas approximately parallel packing is preferred for C60-2-Py, resulting in a shortened intermolecular distance for C60-3-Py and C60-4-Py, which reinforces the coordination interactions between their pyridine moieties and the Pb2+ ions of the MAPbI3 perovskite.
Effect of the nitrogen site of C60-n-Py on the charge recombination kinetics of iPSC devices
In order to elucidate the effect of the nitrogen site of C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4) on the charge recombination kinetics of the perovskite film, we measured the steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the perovskite layers.46,47 The steady-state PL spectra of the MAPbI3/C60-n-Py films and the pristine MAPbI3 perovskite film were measured at an excitation wavelength of 460 nm. The strong PL peak of the pristine MAPbI3 perovskite film is detected at 764 nm. Upon depositing the C60-n-Py ETL, the characteristic PL peaks of the perovskite films were quenched by 79.2%, 87.9% and 83.1% for C60-2-Py, C60-3-Py and C60-4-Py, respectively (Fig. 5a). The highest quenching ratio of C60-3-Py suggests that C60-3-Py has the most effective charge transport due to its optimized nitrogen site. In addition, the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were also measured and were fitted with a biexponential function as shown in Fig. 5b.30 The pristine MAPbI3 perovskite film exhibits a carrier lifetime of τ = 22.63 ns, which decreases to 18.17, 4.63 and 7.91 ns upon depositing the C60-2-Py, C60-3-Py and C60-4-Py ETL, respectively (see ESI S12† for detailed analyses). The smallest carrier lifetime obtained for the MAPbI3/C60-3-Py film suggests the fastest electron transfer from the perovskite film to the fullerene derivative layer. This can effectively decrease the charge recombination at the interface of the perovskite layer and cathode, contributing to the largest Jsc.

(c) Dark current–voltage responses of the electron-only devices with the C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4) ETL, from which the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) is determined as the kink point. (d) Nyquist plots of the C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4)-based devices measured in the dark at a reverse potential of 1.0 V. The points show the experimental data and the solid lines show the fitted curves. The inset shows the equivalent circuit model used for fitting the impedance spectra. 
We further investigate the influence of the nitrogen site of C60-n-Py on trap state passivation of theMAPbI3 perovskite film. We fabricated electron-only devices with the structure of ITO/TiO2/perovskite/C60-n-Py/Ag and estimated the trap state density within the MAPbI3 perovskite film by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method.48–51 According to the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) at the kink point from the linearly ohmic regime to the nonlinearly trap-state filled regime (Fig. 5c), the calculated trap-state density (nt) of the perovskite films with C60-2-Py, C60-3-Py, and C60-4-Py are 2.946 × 1016 cm−3, 2.088 × 1016 cm−3 and 2.243 × 1016, respectively (see ESI S13† for detailed analyses). The lowest nt value for C60-3-Py indicates its maximum degree of passivation of the trap state within the MAPbI3 perovskite film due to the strongest coordination interaction with perovskite.
We next performed similar SCLC measurements based on another type of electron-only device structure of ITO/MAPbI3/C60-n-Py/Ag so as to reveal the effect of the nitrogen site of C60-n-Py on the electron mobility (μe) of the perovskite film. Based on the Mott–Gurney law,52–54 the calculated μe values of perovskite films with C60-2-Py, C60-3-Py and C60-4-Py are 1.02 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 S−1, 2.95 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 S−1 and 2.64 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 S−1, respectively (see ESI S14† for detailed analysis). The highest μe value of C60-3-Py is due to the lowest trap states within the MAPbI3 layer due to its optimal nitrogen site.
Finally, we studied the interfacial charge transport behavior of perovskite films with C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4) by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in the dark at a reverse potential of 1.0 V. The Nyquist plots of devices based on the C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4) ETLs were obtained and fitted as one arc in the high frequency regime using an equivalent circuit used for fitting (see the inset).52,55 The fitted parameters obtained from Nyquist plots are summarized in ESI Table S8,† including series resistance (Rs) and charge transfer resistance (Rct), which are related to the internal series resistance and charge transfer resistance of the device, respectively. Although the Rs values (16.62–19.85 Ω cm2) for devices with the C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4) ETL are similar, their corresponding Rct values show considerable distinction, decreasing from 511.6 Ω cm2 (C60-2-Py) to 178.5 Ω cm2 (C60-4-Py) and 53.2 Ω cm2 (C60-3-Py). The lowest Rct value of C60-3-Py indicates the most effective inhibition of the unfavorable electron–hole recombination at the perovskite/C60-3-Py interface due to the optimized nitrogen site, contributing to the highest Jsc and FF for the corresponding device.
Effect of the nitrogen site of C60-n-Py on the stability of the iPSC device
We performed the steady-state photocurrent output measurements at the maximum power point so as to verify the performance reliability of iPSC devices based on C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4) ETLs.56,57 After 300 s illumination at the maximum power point, the PCEs of iPSC devices containing the C60-2-Py, C60-3-Py and C60-4-Py ETLs were stabilized at 12.97%, 17.29%, and 16.68%, respectively (see ESI Fig. S16†). This is consistent with the trend of PCE obtained from J–V curves, confirming the reliability of the measured performance.
We further evaluated the effect of the nitrogen site of C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4) on the ambient stabilities of the devices stored in an ambient and dark environment (temperature 20 °C, relative humidity: 35%) without any encapsulation. As illustrated in Fig. 6, the ambient stability of the device sensitively depends on the nitrogen site of C60-n-Py. The PCE of the C60-2-Py device dramatically drops to ca. 9.8% of the initial value after 1400 h storage, revealing that its ambient stability is even worse than that of the device based on the PCBM ETL.58 However, upon employing the C60-3-Py or C60-4-Py ETL, the ambient stabilities of the corresponding devices increase significantly, with the PCE retaining ca. 81.8% and 73.5% of the initial values, respectively, after 1400 h storage. Since the hydrophobicities of C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4) are comparable (see ESI Fig. S17†), the highest ambient stability of the C60-3-Py device is attributed to its most efficient passivation of the trap state within the MAPbI3 perovskite film due to the strongest coordination interaction with perovskite as discussed above.20

Applications of C60-n-Py ETLs in the CsFAMA iPSC device
We also examined the universality of C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4) ETLs by using them in another commonly used Cs0.05FA0.83MA0.12PbI2.55Br0.45 (abbreviated as CsFAMA) absorber system, with a device architecture of FTO/Poly(bis(4-phenyl) (2,4,6- trimethylphenyl)amine) (PTAA)/CsFAMA/C60-n-Py/BCP/Ag (see ESI S18† for the detailed fabrication procedure). According to the comparison of the statistical data of over 10 devices (see ESI Table S9†), the photovoltaic parameters (PCE, Voc, Jsc, and FF) of the devices based on C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4) exhibit a similar tendency as those of MAPbI3 devices, confirming the universality of our approach in steering the electron transport properties of C60-n-Py. In particular, with the best electron transport performance among the three C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4) ETLs, the highest PCE of the CsFAMA devices based on the C60-3-Py ETL reaches 18.65%, which is much higher than that obtained for the corresponding MAPbI3 device (17.57%). Therefore, the strongest coordination interaction of the pyridine moieties within C60-3-Py with Pb2+ ions is applicable for the CsFAMA perovskite as well.
Conclusions
In summary, three novel pyridine-functionalized fullerene derivatives C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4) with variable nitrogen sites were synthesized via a facile one-step 1,3 dipolar cycloaddition reaction, and the effect of the nitrogen site on the electron transport properties of the fullerene derivative was elucidated for the first time. The molecular structures and crystal packing of C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4) were unambiguously determined by X-ray single crystal diffraction. Although C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4) exhibits negligible difference in the molecular energy level and optical absorption, the electron transport properties of C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4) are sensitively dependent on the nitrogen site within the pyridine moiety, with C60-3-Py showing the highest PCE of 17.57% for MAPbI3 iPSC devices. Due to the optimal nitrogen site, the pyridine moieties within C60-3-Py have the strongest coordination interactions with Pb2+ ions of the MAPbI3 perovskite, leading to the most efficient passivation of the trap state within the MAPbI3 perovskite film and consequently the most efficient electron transport and superior ambient stability. C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4) were further applied as ETLs of CsFAMA iPSC devices, and C60-3-Py shows the best ETL performance as well, confirming the universality of our approach in steering the electron transport properties of C60-n-Py. Elucidation of the effect of the nitrogen site on the electron transport properties of the fullerene derivative in our present work provides a fundamental understanding of the structure–property correlation of the fullerene derivative ETL and offers a new opportunity to design alternative ETLs for achieving high-efficiency PSC devices.

MALDI-TOF MS m/z: calculated for C71H16N2 [M]+ 896.71; found 896.41.


C60-4-Py. 
The synthesis of C60-4-Py was reported previously by our group.21 In brief, a chlorobenzene mixture of C60, N-butyl glycine and 4-pyridinecarboxaldehyde at 80 °C and in a nitrogen atmosphere afforded the C60-4-Py with a yield of 34.6%. For comparison, the 1H NMR, 13C NMR and MALDI-TOF mass spectra of C60-4-BPy are also shown in the ESI.†

X-ray crystallographic studies of C60-2-Py, C60-3-Py and C60-4-Py
Black crystals suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction were achieved by the slow evaporation of the toluene solution containing C60-n-Py and decapyrrylcorannulene as the host. After one or two weeks, small black crystals formed in the glass tubes were sent to the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF, the beamline BL17B) for the collection of X-ray diffraction data at 100 K using a wavelength of 0.71073 Å and a CCD detector. The multi-scan method was used for absorption corrections. The structures were solved by the direct method and refined with full-matrix least-squares refinement using the SHELXL-2016/6 within OLEX2. The detailed refinement parameters are listed in ESI Tables S4.†
DFT calculations
Our first-principles calculations are based on density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) with the exchange-correlation functional of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). Surface slabs with a vacuum thickness of 20 Å were modeled as (110)-terminated slabs of the tetragonal structure. In our structure, a 2 layer supercell of the 2 × 3 (110) surface with PbI2 as the terminal with the bottom layer fixed was used; the nitrogen atom in functionalized C60 binds to the Pb2+ ion. A plane-wave cutoff energy of 400 (450) eV and a 1 × 1 × 1 Γ point were used for structural optimization (self-consistent). The convergence threshold for self-consistent iteration is 10−5 eV, and all the atomic positions are fully optimized until all the components of the residual forces are smaller than 0.1 eV Å−1. The absorption energies (Eabs., eV) for C60-MAPbI3 are calculated using: Eabs. = E(C60-X@MAPbI3) − E(MAPbI3) − E(C60-X), X = 2-Py, 3-Py, 4-Py, where E(structure) is the calculated energy of the corresponding structure.
Device fabrication
The detailed fabrication procedure of iPSCs was the same as previously reported. FTO-coated glass was cleaned by sequential ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol for 15 min and then treated with ultraviolet-ozone for 20 min.
For the MAPbI3 iPSC device, a NiOx precursor solution (0.1 mmol in 10 ml ethanol and 60 μl ethanolamine) was spin-coated on the precleaned substrate at 6000 rpm for 30 s and then annealed at 280 °C for 40 min. Next, the perovskite precursor solution (CH3NH3I and PbI2 in a 1:1 molar ratio dissolved in DMSO and DMF with a volume ratio of 3:7) was then spin-coated onto the NiOx HTL at 1000 rpm for 10 s and 4000 rpm for 45 s. During the last 25 s of the second spin-coating procedure, 80 μl CB was dropped onto the substrate. The as-spun films were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min.
Then, a PCBM solution (20 mg ml−1 in CB) and C60-n-Py (n = 2, 3, 4) solution were deposited onto the surface of the perovskite layer by spin coating at different spin-coating speeds for 30 s. Finally, the devices were completed by thermally evaporating 8 nm BCP and 100 nm of silver (Ag) in a vacuum of about 10−5 Torr. The device working area was 0.1 cm2, which is defined by the overlap of the Ag cathode and FTO.
Measurements and characterization

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV 400 MHz NMR spectrometer with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard. Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry was performed on a Bruker Autoflex Speed mass spectrometer. FTIR spectra were recorded on a TENSOR 27 spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) using KBr pellets as the substrate. UV-vis absorption spectra were measured on a UV-vis-NIR 3600 spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan). Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry was carried out on a CHI630D Electrochemical Workstation, with a Pt disk as the working electrode, a Pt wire as the counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode as the reference electrode. A solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBPA) in o-dichlorobenzene was used as the electrolyte, and the scan rate was 50 mV s−1.
Current density–voltage (J–V) characterization was performed using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit under simulated AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2) with a standard xenon-lamp-based solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3A, USA), which was calibrated with a monocrystalline silicon reference cell (Oriel P/N 91150 V, with KG-5 visible color filter) and the reference cell was calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). EQE measurements were conducted on an ORIEL Intelligent Quantum Efficiency (IQE) 200 TM Measurement system, which was equipped with a tunable light source. XPS measurements were carried out on a Thermo ESCALAB 250 instrument with a monochromatized Al Kα X-ray source. The SEM image was acquired with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FEI Quanta 200). AFM images were obtained on an XE-7 scanning probe microscope in non-contact mode (Park systems, Korea). The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using an Edinburgh Instruments FLS920 fluorescence spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 460 nm. For time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra, the samples were excited using a 543 nm picosecond pulsed diode laser with a pulse width of 104 ps (Picoquant Gmbh Solea Supercontinuum Laser using the time-correlated single-photon counting method, and Timeharp 260 software was used to record the decays). Impedance spectroscopic (EIS) measurements were performed with a frequency from 1 MHz to 1 Hz at 1.0 V in the dark using an electrochemical workstation (Autolab 320, Metrohm, Switzerland). Alternating current 20 mV perturbation was applied. The resulting impedance spectra were fitted with Z-View software (v2.8b, Scribner Associates, USA).
