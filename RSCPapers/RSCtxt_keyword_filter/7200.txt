    , Accepted 21st April 2020First published on 21st April 2020AbstractOrganic small molecules like ammonium halide salts (AHSs) are widely used to suppress the non-radiative charge recombination of solution-processed halide perovskite films with defective surface and unfavorable energy levels for enhanced photovoltage, but more often than not at a cost of enlarging the band gap of perovskite materials, which limits the light absorption and thus, the photocurrent density. In addition, there is still a lack of fundamental understanding and visual characterization of the surface and bulk composition change upon subsequent surface treatment with heterogeneous ingredients. Herein, we report and identify that AHS soaking treatment enables the formation of δ-FAPbI3 on the surface of the perovskite film for defect passivation functions, thus reducing the interfacial recombination loss and increasing photovoltage. Meanwhile, the AHS molecules diffuse and alloy with the bulk perovskite material to reduce the band gap, red-shifting the absorption region and thus increasing the photocurrent. Blade-coated perovskite solar cells (PSCs) prepared via AHS treatment achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.9% with a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) up to 1.18 V under AM 1.5G sun illumination, which is remarkably higher than the pristine PSCs without any treatment (19.2%), and outperforms other blade-coated PSCs, regardless of their perovskite compositions. Surface treatment of perovskite films with functional, organic small molecules is a promising strategy for rational composition management and favorable gradient distribution, which are beneficial for realizing efficient and stable PSCs.
Introduction
Over the past decade, organic–inorganic halide perovskite materials have commanded ever-increasing attention owing to their intriguing optoelectronic properties (i.e., tunable band gap,1 long carrier diffusion length2 and high absorption coefficient3), full solution processability,4 and promising use in a variety of optoelectronic applications, such as perovskite solar cells,5,6 light emitting diodes (LEDs),7 CO2 reduction,8 photodetectors,9 sensing10 and photocatalysis,11etc. Among these applications, extraordinary success has been achieved with PSCs, as evidenced by a rocketing certified PCE, now exceeding 25%,12 which is already on a par with or even higher than other thin film photovoltaic counterparts, such as conventional polycrystalline silicon, copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) and cadmium telluride CdTe solar cells. However, the best-performing PSCs with record efficiencies are fabricated via a spin-coating method on a laboratory scale,13 which is not suitable to commercialize this attractive technology.
To date, many scalable techniques have been developed, including spray-coating,14 slot-die coating,15 inkjet printing16 and blade-coating.17 The last is regarded as one of the most promising scalable fabrication techniques being a fast, easy and economic printing method, compatible with roll-to-roll mass production. Early efforts in modifying the blade-coating parameters (e.g., adjusting the substrate temperature and wettability,18 controlling the solution flow and film drying dynamics,19 widening the processing window of perovskite inks,20etc.) have achieved uniform coatings of high-quality, large-scale perovskite films. In addition, useful strategies including composition,21 additive22 or dopant engineering23 have boosted the device performance by over 20%, improved the device stability and/or simplified the device architecture. Despite this progress, the device performance of state-of-the-art blade-coated PSCs still lags behind the best spin-coated counterparts,24 mainly due to the less controlled nucleation and/or crystal growth of the blade-coated films, presence of high densities of surface defects/trap states and a suboptimal band gap of perovskite compositions. Therefore, further enhancement in device efficiency is desirable for blade-coated PSCs, which can be achieved by developing novel strategies for achieving rational composition manipulation and effective defect passivation.
Surface treatment is an effective strategy to either passivate surface defects or form a moisture-resistant protection layer on perovskite films. For instance, organic halide salts have been widely utilized to modify the top surface of the perovskite film, which normally results in the composition of the top perovskite layer having different chemical or electric properties.25 For example, when a three-dimensional perovskite surface was treated with long-chain, organic alkyl ammonium salts like iso-butylammonium iodide (i-BAI)26 or phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI),27 a wide band gap, two-dimensional thin perovskite thin layer was formed on top of the bulk perovskite. Moreover, the thin layer was robustly resistant to moisture invasion. Very recently, Zhu and co-workers demonstrated the use of a large organic cation ammonium halide (i.e., guanidinium bromide, GABr) to treat a mixed cation and mixed halide perovskite, which significantly suppressed non-radiative recombination to achieve an extremely small Voc deficit.28 Surface treatment by GABr led to a favorable energy level alignment between the top surface and underlying bulk perovskite layer, owing to the gradient change in the conduction (or valence) band. This facilitated charge extraction and collection from the perovskite to the carrier transport layer/electrode, thus improving Voc. Incorporating Br or long-chain amines into the perovskite composition undoubtedly enlarges the band gap and thus limits the light absorption capability of the perovskite layer. Hence, there is a dilemma in the currently reported surface treatments, because in most cases Voc enhancement is achieved by sacrificing some portion of the short-circuit current (Jsc). On the one hand, it is highly promising, yet very challenging to simultaneously increase Jsc and Voc for enhanced device performance via a simple surface treatment with purposely selected molecules. Therefore, developing an efficient surface engineering protocol is highly desirable, especially one targeted for blade-coated PSC devices.
Here we report a new surface engineering strategy by simply immersing a bladed MAPbI3 perovskite film into a hot bath of formamidinium iodide (FAI), which enables an unusual reverse gradient distribution of heterogeneous compositions in the surface and bulk of the perovskite films. This is manifested in two ways. First, δ-FAPbI3 was spontaneously formed and mainly accumulated at the top surface of MAPbI3, and could effectively passivate surface defects for an enhanced Voc. Second, vertical diffusion upon thermal annealing of surplus FAI enabled its alloying with bulk MAPbI3, altering the perovskite composition with a slightly reduced band gap (from 1.57 eV to 1.55 eV) for improved light absorption. It is worth noting that the “bottom-up” gradient composition change from a black-phase (i.e., α-phase) alloyed perovskite to a yellow-phase (i.e., δ-phase) non-perovskite is energy-level favorable, and facilitates charge extraction from the perovskite to the hole transport layer (HTL) or the electron transport layer (ETL). Profiting from these synergistic functions and advantages, we achieved a PCE as high as 21.9% for blade-coated PSCs, along with a Jsc of 23.5 mA cm−2 and a Voc of 1.18 V (corresponding to a small Voc deficit of 0.37 V), which is 14% higher than those of the devices without treatment (19.2%). Moreover, the operational stability of the blade-coated devices based on FAI-modified perovskite films was dramatically enhanced.
Designing rules and proposed mechanism for rational composition management
It is well-known that the formation energy of δ-FAPbI3 (yellow phase) is much lower than that of α-FAPbI3 (black phase), especially when there is excess PbI2 existing in the perovskite compositions and the processing temperature is relatively low (<150 °C).29 However, in the presence of MA cations, the formation of black phase alloyed FA/MA perovskites with reduced band gap is more energy favorable than forming the aforementioned δ-FAPbI3 (Fig. 1a). In this work, we employed a simple FAI hot bath to treat the as-prepared PbI2-rich MAPbI3 film, aiming to achieve a rational compositional management from the surface to the bottom along the vertical direction of the bulk perovskite film (Fig. 1b). As is depicted in Fig. 1c, the MAPbI3 film was fabricated by a blade-coated process (see the Experimental section for details), subjected to post treatment in a FAI hot bath (2 mg mL−1 in isopropanol, 70 °C), and followed by thermal annealing for ion diffusion/exchange and film crystallization. To trigger the reaction or diffusion of FAI with the bulk perovskite layer, we intentionally incorporated 1 mol% excess lead iodide (PbI2) into pristine MAPbI3, which led to obviously altered optoelectronic properties, such as a reduced band gap (discussed below). Otherwise, without this excess, the FAI post treatment had a negligible effect, as indicated by photoluminescence (PL) (Fig. S1†). For comparison, we directly added 1% FAPbI3 into the MAPbI3 precursor solution to prepare a mixed cation perovskite film by the blade-coated method (denoted as MAPbI3 + 1% FAPbI3).

We have proposed a most plausible mechanism for the bladed-MAPbI3 film with FAI treatment (FT), consisting of a chemical reaction, ion exchange and resultant phase/composition distribution. At relatively low temperatures, the formation energy of δ-FAPbI3 is 0.13 eV lower than that of α-FAPbI3.30 Thus, FAI first reacted with excess PbI2 to generate δ-FAPbI3, which is thermodynamically stable, at the top surface of the bulk perovskite. Upon thermal annealing, the excessive FAI diffused into the underlying bulk perovskite. Unlike the formation of δ-FAPbI3 on the top surface, the relatively higher temperature at the bottom of the bulk, which is closer to the heated substrate, favors the enthalpy of formation for black-phase α-FAPbI3 perovskite. In this case, the α-FAPbI3 tended to alloy with MAPbI3 and convert to a FA/MA mixed cation perovskite. In addition, the MA+ cation stabilized the formation of black-phase FAPbI3, which, in principle, kept α-FAPbI3 mainly distributed at the bottom surface to alloy with MAPbI3 for the formation of the FA/MA alloyed perovskite. As a result, an unusual reverse gradient distribution of α/δ-FAPbI3 was spontaneously obtained via a simple treatment of soaking in a FAI bath with subsequent “bottom-up” thermal annealing.
Identifying the phase/composition distribution in perovskite films with FT
Non-stoichiometric MAPbI3 showed an intense X-ray diffraction (XRD) peak at 12.7°, which is assigned to excess PbI2 (Fig. 2a). After FAI surface treatment of the MAPbI3 film (denoted as MAPbI3 with FT), the PbI2 peak became weaker, while the original peaks shifted and a new XRD pattern emerged, suggesting that the reaction of FAI and surplus PbI2 led to the formation of new compositions. Specifically, there is a peak located at 11.7°, which is attributed to δ-FAPbI3 (Fig. 2a).31 The presence of δ-FAPbI3 was further confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) which identified two distinct lattice fringes; one at 3.12 Å assigned to the (220) plane of MAPbI3, and the other at 2.74 Å for the (011) plane of δ-FAPbI3 (Fig. 2b).29 In addition, the (110) peak was slightly blue-shifted, indicating lattice expansion upon FAI incorporation, which can be attributed to the exchange between methyl ammonium (MA+) and formamidinium (FA+) cations, or the occupation of MA+ vacancies by FA+ cations. Note, the ionic radius of FA+ (2.3 Å) is larger than MA+ (1.8 Å).32

It has been reported that excess PbI2 in the bulk perovskite tends to aggregate at grain boundaries (GBs) and/or the film surface.33 When the as-prepared MAPbI3 film was immersed in the FAI bath, a surface reaction between FAI and PbI2 occurred first to form FAPbI3. However, the non-perovskite hexagonal phase δ-FAPbI3 is more thermodynamically stable and thus easily formed at low temperatures. Upon annealing, the surplus FAI diffused vertically through bulk MAPbI3 to induce gradient composition change owing to the alloying behavior between different cations and anions, for instance, forming thermally stable FA/MA alloyed perovskites. Diffusion and alloying are dynamic processes that will eventually reach equilibrium. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) was used to analyze the compositional changes by evaluating the surface contact potential difference (CPD) of perovskite films upon FT (see the device configuration and setup illustrated in Fig. 2e). For comparison, a pure δ-FAPbI3 film and a MAPbI3 + 1% FAPbI3 film were prepared. Fig. 2f and g give direct visualizations of the CPD change of perovskite films with different phases and/or compositions. The pristine MAPbI3 film showed an average CPD of −159 mV (Fig. 2g and S2a†), while the FA/MA alloyed perovskite (i.e. MAPbI3 + 1% FAPbI3) had a decreased average CPD of −206 mV (Fig. 2g and S2d†). Notably, the surface average CPD of the MAPbI3 film with FAI surface treatment (i.e., MAPbI3 with FT) was significantly reduced to −250 mV (Fig. 2g and S2b†), which is very close to the pure δ-FAPbI3 film (average CPD of −275 mV, Fig. S2c†). This result, to some extent, suggests that the surface of the MAPbI3 film is rich in δ-FAPbI3 after FT. Additionally, the presence of a little δ-FAPbI3 passivates surface defects,7,29 as evidenced by the enhanced PL intensity (Fig. 2c). To verify the distribution of δ-FAPbI3, the top surface of MAPbI3 with FT film was excited by 600 nm and 461 nm laser light. It is generally believed that lasers with different wavelengths can penetrate to different depths of the film.29 Specifically, PL intensity enhanced up to 2.9 times was observed when the MAPbI3 with the FT film was excited by the laser with a wavelength of 461 nm (a depth of less than 100 nm of the perovskite surface was excited), indicating that δ-FAPbI3 was mainly distributed on the top surface and may have a lessening gradient distribution towards the deeper part of the bulk MAPbI3 (Fig. S3†). The phenomenon of surface defect passivation was further investigated by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay measurements, for which a longer PL lifetime of up to 600 ns was obtained for MAPbI3 with FT excited by a laser light of 404 nm (Fig. 2d). These results imply that surface charge trapping and non-radiative charge recombination in FAI-treated films is largely suppressed,34 owing to the effective surface defect passivation and enhanced carrier lifetime by the in situ formation of δ-FAPbI3.
In Fig. 2c, there is a noticeable red-shift of the PL peak for the MAPbI3 with FT film, which can be related to the reduced band gap of perovskite materials after FT. Furthermore, this is associated with the broadening of the absorption onset to a longer wavelength region (Fig. S4†). It should be noted that δ-FAPbI3 is a non-perovskite phase, which will not affect the band gap of the perovskite material. We thus inferred that surplus FAI can react with PbI2 (in excess) to form α-FAPbI3 and then alloy with MAPbI3 to form the FA+/MA+ mixed cation perovskite with a black phase and reduced band gap. During PL measurements, pristine MAPbI3 had a peak position at 787 nm regardless of the excitation direction from the air side or glass side (Fig. S5†). In contrast, a red-shift of 7 nm or 11 nm was observed for MAPbI3 with FT film when excited from the air side or glass side, respectively. This confirmed the change of bulk perovskite composition upon FAI diffusion and reaction, and further suggested that the band gap reduction was due to alloying between FA and MA cations. Moreover, the greater shift of the PL peak at the bottom of the MAPbI3 with FT film (i.e., on the glass side) implies that an increasing portion of α-FAPbI3 was located at the bottom of the bulk perovskite layer. Hence, α-FAPbI3 could alloy with MAPbI3 to form an alloyed perovskite with an increasing FA/MA cation ratio and thus a smaller band gap. Based on the PL, TRPL and KPFM results it was deduced that the FT results in a vertical gradient distribution of α/δ-FAPbI3 in the bulk perovskite film, in which the top surface is rich in δ-FAPbI3 and the bottom part is mainly constituted by α-FAPbI3. Another consequence of FT was a gradient composition distribution from grain interiors to GBs. α-FAPbI3 was distributed in the grain interior where it could alloy with MAPbI3, while δ-FAPbI3 was mainly located at GBs. This effectively passivated the defective grain surface and GBs, and stabilized the inner perovskite (Fig. S6†).
Film morphologies, device architectures, energy level diagram, photovoltaic performances and stability evaluation
The effect of FT on the morphology and roughness of the pristine perovskite film was also investigated. As can be seen in Fig. S7a and S8a,† the blade-coated MAPbI3 film featured small grains (average size of 200 nm) and a relatively rough surface (a root mean square (RMS) value of 21.0 nm). Some relatively bright dots randomly distributed at GBs and/or the surface are speculated to be excess PbI2, as evidenced by XRD (Fig. 2a). In contrast, these bright heterogeneous aggregations disappeared on the MAPbI3 with FT films, accompanied by enlarged grains (average size of 530 nm, Fig. S7b†) and a relatively smoother surface (RMS of 14.5 nm, Fig. S8b†). This transformation can be possibly attributed to the reaction between FAI and excess PbI2, which is able to induce secondary growth of perovskite crystals upon organic AHS surface treatment.28,35 It should be noted that the improved uniformity and smoothness of the MAPbI3 with FT film is beneficial for conformal coating of the ETL and the cathode on top of that, thus facilitating interfacial charge transport for improved device performance.
We fabricated PSC devices with a p–i–n planar heterojunction architecture, namely, ITO/HTL/perovskite/ETL/Cu (Fig. 3a), where the perovskite layer has an unusual reverse vertical gradient distribution of α/δ-FAPbI3 with the alloyed FA/MA black-phase perovskite composition at the bottom and the yellow-phase non-perovskite on top. Using reported values and our KPFM study, we sketched the energy level diagram of the completed PSCs based on MAPbI3 with FT films, with different phase/composition distributions in the vertical direction (Fig. S9†). To elucidate the effect on the interfacial charge transfer processes of α/δ-FAPbI3 distribution at the top or bottom of the bulk perovskite, we approximated the MAPbI3 with FT film into a unity and aligned the α/δ-FAPbI3 energy levels to the same level. As shown in Fig. 3b, only the band bending at the HTL/perovskite interface and charge transfer at the perovskite/ETL interface are schematically illustrated. It has been reported that alloyed α-FAPbI3/MAPbI3 (i.e., FA/MA mixed cation perovskite) can stabilize volatile MA+ ions and thus maintain the black-phase perovskite, which could release the strain in the crystal lattice and so induce upward band bending at the perovskite/HTL interface for improved hole extraction.23,36 For the perovskite/ETL interface, δ-FAPbI3 may act as an insulating contact between the perovskite and C60, which could effectively passivate the surface defects. In addition, considering the matched energy level alignment between the conduction band minimal (CBM) of the perovskite and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of C60, the photo-separated electrons are able to tunnel though the very thin δ-FAPbI3 to be collected by electron-selective contacts.37

The current density–voltage (J–V) curves for the best-performing PSCs based on MAPbI3 perovskite films with or without FT are shown in Fig. 3c. The PSC based on MAPbI3 with a FT film had an impressive PCE of up to 21.9%, which is significantly higher than that of its pristine MAPbI3-based counterpart (19.2%) or the alloyed FA/MA mixed cation perovskite-based device (19.6%, Fig. S10†). The superior device performance due to FT benefited from the concurrent enhancement of all photovoltaic parameters (Table 1), which are attributed to a reduced band gap for improved light absorption, modified energy level alignment, and enhanced defect passivation efficacy for facilitated charge extraction and suppressed charge recombination (discussed below). The Jsc of the pristine MAPbI3-based PSC was only 22.5 mA cm−2, mainly limited by its optical band gap. In contrast, we successfully red-shifted the band gap of the MAPbI3 perovskite via the simple FT, extending the absorption edge of the perovskite materials and thus increasing Jsc. As shown in Fig. 3d and S11,† the onset of the external quantum efficiency (EQE) red-shifted from 789 nm for the MAPbI3-based device to 799 nm for the MAPbI3 with FT film-based PSC, corresponding to a band gap reduction from 1.57 to 1.55 eV. For the PSC based on the alloyed FA/MA mixed cation perovskite, which was prepared by directly mixing 1% FAPbI3 into the MAPbI3 precursor solution, a red-shift of the EQE onset from 789 to 795 nm also occurred, with a band gap of 1.56 eV (Fig. S11 and Table S1†). These results confirm our deduction that band gap narrowing for the FAI-treated sample can be attributed to the formation of α-FAPbI3, which alloys with MAPbI3 to change the pristine perovskite composition. In addition, it also suggests that FAI surface treatment is more effective in reducing the band gap than directly mixing a similar portion of FA cations into the perovskite ink. The EQE value of the MAPbI3 with FT film device was higher than the control counterpart, exceeding 85% across a broad wavelength region from 450 to 750 nm. Furthermore, the integrated Jsc (22.8 mA cm−2) from the EQE spectrum was in good agreement with that derived from the J–V curve (23.5 mA cm−2), with a discrepancy of less than 3%. Notably, the Voc of the MAPbI3 with FT film device reached 1.18 V, a considerable 40 mV increase compared to the control MAPbI3 device (Voc of 1.14 V). Considering that the MAPbI3 with FT film device had an optical band gap of 1.55 eV, the high Voc corresponds to a low Voc deficit of just 0.37 V, which can be ascribed to the effective defect passivation induced by the in situ δ-FAPbI3 surface modification. The J–V hysteresis of the MAPbI3 with FT film device was negligible, with only a 1.4% absolute PCE discrepancy between the forward and reverse scans (Fig. S12 and Table S2†). Fig. 3e depicts the stabilized photocurrent density of the champion device measured at 0.98 V, yielding a stabilized PCE of 21.3% under AM 1.5G one sun illumination. The PCE histogram of MAPbI3 and MAPbI3 with FT film-based PSCs was constructed from data collected from a batch of 30 devices for each film (Fig. 3f). More than 87% of MAPbI3 with FT film cells had PCEs above 20%, while only 40% of the pristine MAPbI3 devices had efficiencies over 19% under one sun illumination, which highlights the good reproducibility of using a simple FAI treatment to improve the device performance of blade-coated PSCs. Compared with other reported blade-coated PSCs, variously based on engineered compositions or additives, or optimized processing techniques (Table S3†), the facile AHS bath treatment demonstrated in this work yielded a record PCE approaching 22%. In addition to the high initial performance, the operational stability of the blade-coated devices under realistic conditions should be considered seriously.38 The operational stability of encapsulated PSCs based on MAPbI3 with FT and MAPbI3 films was compared under continuous 1 sun illumination. The former device retained 94% of its initial PCE, while the latter had degraded to approximately 78% of its original PCE after 500 h (Fig. 3g). The improved stability after FT was attributed to four reasons. First, the formation of the alloyed FA/MA mixed-cation perovskite is more thermodynamically stable than pure MAPbI3, withstanding temperatures rises exceeding 60 °C during operation.39 Second, FT led to secondary crystal growth that improved the quality of the perovskite films by promoting large grains and less defects, thus reducing the degradation rate of the perovskite itself. Third, the unusual reverse vertical gradient distribution of different compositions within the perovskite films, to some extent, modifies the energy level and interface, which facilitates charge extraction and collection, while inhibiting charge accumulation that impairs device performance. Fourth, the self-assembly of δ-FAPbI3 (an intrinsically passivating, non-perovskite phase) on top and/or at GBs, both stabilizes the perovskite phase and passivates surface defects, which could effectively alleviate degradation induced by defects.40

Defect passivation, carrier transport and recombination dynamics
To investigate the carrier recombination dynamics in the operating devices, carrier recombination lifetimes of MAPbI3 devices with or without FT were compared using transient photovoltage (TPV) decay measurements. The open-circuited devices were irradiated under AM 1.5G illumination and a small transient photovoltaic signal was triggered by using a laser pulse (337 nm, 4 ns) to measure the TPV decay.41 The carrier recombination lifetime was increased from 0.60 μs in the MAPbI3 device to 0.85 μs for the MAPbI3 with FT film device (Fig. 4a). This result confirmed that the reverse gradient distribution of heterogeneous perovskite compositions induced by FT was beneficial to suppress charge carrier recombination, rationalizing the high Voc of up to 1.18 V in the blade-coated device. Therefore, the prolonged carrier recombination lifetime (Fig. 4a) and suppressed non-radiative recombination (Fig. 2c and d) of MAPbI3 with FT film-based PSCs can be attributed to the effective reduction of trap densities within the perovskite film. The trap density of states (tDOS) for control and target devices was measured using thermal admittance spectroscopy (TAS). As shown in Fig. 4b, the MAPbI3 with FT film device had lower tDOS than its pristine MAPbI3 counterpart, both in the deeper trap region (0.40–0.55 eV), where tDOS was nearly an order of magnitude lower and was assigned to defects at the film surface, and in the shallower trap region (0.30–0.40 eV) which corresponded to the density traps at GBs.23 This confirms that FT efficiently passivates defects on the surface and at GBs, leading to reduced charge recombination loss, and thus achieving a higher Voc in blade-coated PSCs. It should be noted that the defect passivation efficacy is more robust on the perovskite film surface, which can be attributed to the formation and distribution of δ-FAPbI3 after FT. In addition, the transient photocurrent (TPC) decay of the corresponding PSCs was compared (Fig. S13†). The charge transport time of the MAPbI3 with FT film PSC (350 ns) was much shorter than the control device (950 ns), indicating that photogenerated charges in a perovskite film with well-manipulated composition/phase distribution can more efficiently be extracted and collected. Femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy was employed to further understand the ultrafast carrier transfer dynamics of perovskite films, which is sandwiched between PTAA HTL and C60 ETL contact. As shown in Fig. 4c and d, the contour plot of the TA spectroscopy spectrum for both the MAPbI3 and MAPbI3 with FT film samples showed a distinct ground-state bleaching (GSB) peak at approximately 750 nm. The GSB peak intensity reflects the photo-induced carrier population in the conduction and valence bands of the perovskite.42 Compared to its MAPbI3 counterpart, the more rapidly fading signal in the contour plot of the MAPbI3 with FT film sample, suggests that photo-induced electrons and holes were efficiently extracted to the ETL and HTL, respectively. Notably, the induced absorption change (ΔA) intensity of the GSB signal gradually decreased with prolonged delay time. After FT, the GSB peak intensity became weaker for the same delay time, coinciding with faster signal attenuation in the TA spectroscopy spectrum contour plot (Fig. 4e and f). The decay kinetics of GSB were analyzed according to the equation: τaverage = (A1τ12 + A2τ22 + A3τ32)/(A1τ1 + A2τ2 + A3τ3)(1)

There was a much faster decay for the sample with FT, with a calculated τaverage of 900.9 ps versus 3520.8 ps for the control MAPbI3 sample (Fig. 4g and Table S4†). This result verified the benefit of the unusual reverse vertical gradient distribution of α/δ-FAPbI3 for accelerating charge extraction and collection from the perovskite to the respective carrier transport layers.43 This benefit can be ascribed to the favorable band bending and matched energy level alignment at the HTL/perovskite interface,44 where the large majority of α-FAPbI3 was condensed at the bottom of the bulk perovskite, as well as the tunneling contact junction engineering at the perovskite/ETL interface with δ-FAPbI3 mainly accumulated at the top. Overall, we concluded that the unusual reverse vertical gradient distribution of α/δ FAPbI3 in the perovskite film served three major functions, namely, δ-FAPbI3 on top could effectively passivate surface defects for suppressed charge recombination, and α-FAPbI3 at the bottom could reduce the band gap while facilitating carrier transport. Together, these play synergistic roles that can improve the device performance of blade-coated PSCs.
Conclusions
In summary, a simple and facile surface and bulk composition engineering of perovskite films was demonstrated by soaking the films in a bath of FAI, which enabled blade-coating of efficient and stable PSCs. Via surface reaction, ion diffusion and exchange, and phase stabilization, the FT altered the composition of the surface and bulk of the perovskite layer with a non-perovskite phase (δ-FAPbI3) that was largely condensed on the top, and a black perovskite phase (α-FAPbI3) mainly distributed at the bottom. This unusual reverse vertical gradient distribution of α/δ-FAPbI3 not only effectively reduced the band gap of the perovskite materials for enhanced light absorption and increased Jsc, but also effectively passivated the surface defects for suppressed interfacial charge recombination and enhanced Voc. The blade-coated PSCs with FT achieved a high PCE of up to 21.9% as well as significantly improved operational stability (as compared to the untreated device) under illumination. This new AHS-assisted surface engineering can be used as a promising strategy to manage the composition/phase distribution of bulk perovskite materials with optimized optical and electrical properties for ultimately more efficient and stable optoelectronic devices.
Experimental section
Materials
PTAA and DMF were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. MAI was purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology in China. Pb(Ac)2 and hydroiodic acid (57% wt aqueous) was purchased from Aladdin. All chemicals were used as received without further purification.
Device fabrication
The ITO glass substrates were ultrasonically cleaned successively with deionized water, acetone and isopropanol for 30 min, respectively, followed by UV-ozone (UVO) treatment for 15 min. The PTAA solution (2.0 mg mL−1 in toluene) was blade-coated onto the ITO substrate, and annealed at 70 °C for 10 min. The perovskite layers were fabricated via a previously reported blade-coating method.23 The MAPbI3 perovskite ink (1.2 M) was prepared by dissolving MAPbI3 microcrystal powders in DMF. To prepare the MAPbI3 microcrystal powders, Pb(Ac)2 and MAI were first dissolved in an excessive amount of hydroiodic acid (57% wt aqueous) at 100 °C under continuous stirring. When the as-prepared inks gradually cooled down to room temperature, the small MAPbI3 crystallites precipitated at the bottom. Then the MAPbI3 powders were collected and washed with diethyl ether and dried in vacuum for 48 h. In detail, ∼5–10 μL of the as-prepared perovskite ink was blade-coated onto a pre-heated (150 °C) ITO substrate (1.5 × 1.5 cm2), and the film applicator was swiped linearly at a speed of 7.5 mm s−1. The bladed perovskite film was soaked in a 70 °C hot bath45 of FAI solution (2 mg mL−1 in isopropanol) for 10 s, followed by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. Finally, 20 nm of C60, 5 nm of BCP and 80 nm of Cu were thermally evaporated onto the perovskite layer to complete the assembly of the PSC device.
Characterization
The morphologies and cross-sections of the perovskite films were investigated by using a FE-SEM (SU8010) scanning electron microscope. XRD patterns were obtained on a X-ray powder diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation of 1.5418 Å (Rigaku Co.). The J–V curves of the PSCs (voltage scanning rate 0.1 V s−1) and the steady photocurrent under maximum power output bias (0.98 V) were recorded with a Keithley 2400 source-meter under AM1.5G one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2) produced by using a solar simulator (Oriel, model no. 91192). The light intensity was calibrated with an NREL standard Si reference cell. A non-reflective shadow mask of aperture 0.16 cm2 was used to define the active area of the PSCs. EQE spectra were obtained on a Keithley 2000 multimeter as a function of wavelength (300–900 nm) using a Spectral Products DK 240 monochromator. Steady-state PL and TRPL decay were measured with an Edinburgh Instruments FLS980 PL spectrometer. A 461 nm laser and a 600 nm laser with intensities of 100 mW cm−2 were used as the excitation sources for PL measurement, respectively. A pulsed laser source at 404 nm was used for TRPL measurement. KPFM was conducted on a Bruker Dimension Fastscan Bio atomic force microscope. TPV was measured under one sun illumination and recorded by using a 1 GHz Agilent digital oscilloscope. TA measurement was conducted by using a regeneratively amplified Ti:sapphire laser source (Coherent Legend, 800 nm, 150 fs, 5 mJ per pulse, and 1 kHz repetition rate) and Helios (Ultrafast Systems LLC) spectrometers. A portion of the 800 nm output (75%) pulse was frequency doubled in a barium borate (BaB2O4) crystal to generate 400 nm pump light; the residual output was concentrated by using a sapphire window to produce white light continuum (420–780 nm) probe light. The 400 nm pump beam was generated as part of the 800 nm output pulse from the amplifier, and its power was adjusted using neutral-density filters. The pump beam was focused at the sample with a beam waist of ∼360 mm, and the power intensity was fixed at 14 μJ cm−2. With the aid of a mechanical chopper, the pump repetition frequency was synchronized to 500 Hz. The probe and reference beams could be split from the white light continuum and sent to a fiber optics-coupled multichannel spectrometer by using complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor sensors with a frequency of 1 kHz.
