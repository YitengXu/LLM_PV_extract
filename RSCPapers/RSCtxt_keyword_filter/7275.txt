    , Accepted 6th February 2023First published on 7th February 2023AbstractThe asymmetrical group III–VI monolayer Janus M2XY (M = Al, Ga, In; X ≠ Y = S, Se, Te) have attracted widespread attention due to their significant optical absorption properties, which are the potential building blocks for van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure solar cells. In this study, we unraveled an In2STe/GeH vdW heterostructure as a candidate for solar cells by screening the Janus M2XY and GeH monolayers on lattice mismatches and electronic band structures based on first-principles calculations. The results highlight that the In2STe/GeH vdW heterostructure exhibits a type-II band gap of 1.25 eV. The optical absorption curve of the In2STe/GeH vdW heterostructure indicates that it possesses significant optical absorption properties in the visible and ultraviolet light areas. In addition, we demonstrate that the In2STe/GeH vdW heterostructure shows high and directionally anisotropic carrier mobility and good stability. Furthermore, strain engineering improves the theoretical power conversion efficiency of the In2STe/GeH vdW heterostructure up to 19.71%. Our present study will provide an idea for designing Janus M2XY and GeH monolayer-based vdW heterostructures for solar cell applications.
Introduction
Solar energy is a significant potential substitution for fossil fuels as a clean and renewable resource.1,2 By converting solar energy directly into electric energy with the photovoltaic effect, solar cells are promising products that can efficiently capture light energy from the sun.3 Si-based solar cell modules are currently the most mainstream photovoltaic materials because of their environment-friendliness, mature process, and high-cost performance.4 However, the indirect band gap and the demand for purity limit further improvement in efficiency for Si-based solar cells.5,6 As a result, it is necessary to search for new materials for next-generation solar cell applications.7–9 In recent years, two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure-based solar cells have been proposed due to their high carrier mobilities, significant absorption coefficients, and designabilities.10–12 For example, Ti2CO2/Zr2CO213 and BP/SnSe14 vdW heterostructures have been proved to have anisotropy carrier mobilities of more than 103 cm2 V−1 s−1. The absorption coefficients of the AsI3/SbI315 and GaSe/GaTe16 vdW heterostructures reach up to ∼105 cm−1. Moreover, it is helpful to fabricate target vdW heterostructures by searching from a series of potential monolayers.17,18 Thus, searching for good candidates for solar cells from 2D vdW heterostructures is promising and of great importance.
Group III–VI monolayers have high-quality optical properties and electronic transport capabilities, which can be obtained by employing exfoliation from their bulk phases.16 For instance, atomically thin InSe in BN-encapsulation exhibits high carrier mobility exceeding 103 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature, which has been demonstrated to possess strongly suppressed recombination of electron–hole pairs.19 However, 2D MX (M = Al, Ga, In; X = S, Se, Te) monolayers in terms of InSe have large indirect band gaps near 1.8 eV,16,18 which are unsuitable for applying to solar cell absorptions. Inspired by the Janus structured MoSSe,20 Janus M2XY (M = Al, Ga, In; X ≠ Y = S, Se, Te) monolayers have been demonstrated to exhibit novel properties due to the breaking of their symmetrical structure.21 The In2SeTe monolayer was proved to have a direct band gap of 1.8 eV and higher electron mobility than the InSe monolayer because of the smaller electron effective mass and tensile strain on the Se side.21 Using density functional calculations, the Ga2STe, Ga2SeTe, In2STe, and In2SeTe monolayers were found to belong to the direct band-gap semiconductors with stable crystal lattice and great optical absorption properties.22–24 On the other hand, 2D GeH can be obtained by mechanical exfoliation and exhibits a direct band gap of 1.53 eV with high electron mobility of 18195 cm2 V−1 s−1.25,26 Therefore, it is of interest to answer the question of whether fabricating vdW heterostructures with M2XY and GeH monolayers for potential photovoltaic applications is possible. Furthermore, strain engineering can improve the electronic and optical properties in solar cell applications.14,23,27 For example, the conduction band minima (CBM) of the In2SeTe monolayer can be tuned from −5.01 eV to −4.71 eV with compression strains.23 Considering that the energy band structure has tremendous influence on the performance of solar cell absorbers, discussions for the impact of strain engineering are of great interest and importance.
Herein, we performed computational studies on vdW heterostructures fabricated by Janus M2XY (M = Al, Ga, In; X ≠ Y = S, Se, Te) and GeH monolayers via density functional theory calculations. We first screened the Janus M2XY (M = Al, Ga, In; X ≠ Y = S, Se, Te) monolayers by the lattice mismatch and band edge alignment with the GeH monolayer. Herein, the In2STe/GeH vdW heterostructure is screened out, and exhibits 18.13% theoretical power conversion efficiency (PCE), directionally anisotropic carrier mobility and good stability. Furthermore, the maximum theoretical PCE of the In2STe/GeH vdW heterostructure has been improved by strain engineering.
Computational methods
Based on density functional theory (DFT), all of the calculations were dealt with high-throughput platform ALKEMIE28,29 and performed by the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)30,31 within the projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials.30,32 To describe the exchange correlation interactions between electrons, the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)33 of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)34 pseudopotentials were adopted. Considering the interaction of the van der Waals (vdW) force, our work was conducted by using the optB86b-vdW correction.35,36 To ensure that the 2D vdW heterostructures were established, we set a sufficiently large vacuum space (∼20 Å vacuum for each layer) in the z-direction of every 2D material and a proper distance (∼3 Å) between the two layers forming heterostructures as the initial structures. The dipole correction was adopted to prevent the interactions across the periodic vacuum space. Geometric optimization was performed when the cutoff energy and the convergence criteria for energy were set to 500 eV and 10−5 eV atom−1, respectively. On the other hand, k-sampling was performed using 9 × 9 × 1 points by the Monkhorst–Pack37 mesh. To evaluate the electronic band structure more accurately, the band gap and optical property were calculated with the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06)36 hybrid functional.
To form a stable vdW heterostructure, the lattice mismatch δ must be considered, which is described by this formula:38 (1)where A and B are the lattice parameters of the M2XY (M = Al, Ga, In; X ≠ Y = S, Se, Te) and GeH monolayers, respectively. The most stable heterostructure should have the lowest total energy.
The energy difference ΔEi was expressed by:39 ΔEi = Ei − E0(2)where Ei is the total energy of each configuration of the vdW heterostructures, and E0 is the total energy of the most stable configuration. The formation energy Ef can evaluate the possibility of two monolayers forming a vdW heterostructure.16 Moreover, the binding energy Eb can demonstrate the interlayer interaction of a vdW heterostructure.16 These two parameters were calculated according to the following equations: Ef = Etotal − EM2XY − EGeH(3) (4)where Etotal is the total energy of the M2XY/GeH vdW heterostructure. EM2XY and EGeH represent the total energy of the pristine M2XY and GeH monolayers, respectively. On the other hand, EM2XY+GeH in eqn (4) is the sum of the total energy of the mutually independent M2XY and GeH monolayers fixed in the corresponding vdW heterostructure lattice, and A is the interface area.
A high light absorption coefficient indicates strong light absorption capacity, and the absorption coefficients were calculated by the following formula:40 (5)where λ is the photon wavelength, and ε2 is the imaginary part of the dielectric function. For a vdW heterostructure solar cell, the two component layers can be seen as donor and acceptor.
By referring to some very recently published works,41–44 the power conversion efficiency (PCE) η in the limit of 100% external quantum efficiency (EQE) was calculated by the following equation:45 (6)where 0.65 is the band-fill factor, P(ħω) is the solar energy flux at the photon energy value of ħω in air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5 G) diffuse radiation, the solar energy flux at the value of photon energy ħω, Edonorg is the band gap of the donor, and ΔEc is the conduction band offset between the donor and acceptor fixed in vdW heterostructure lattice. The (Edonorg − ΔEc − 0.3) term estimates the maximum open circuit voltage.
Based on the deformation potential theory, the carrier mobility was expressed by the following formulation:46–48 (7)where e is the electron charge, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature (300 K). The DFT obtained parameters m*, Ei and C2D are the effective mass, deformation potential constant of the carrier, and elastic modulus under the uniaxial strain along the transport direction, respectively.
The charge rearrangement at the vdW interface was visualized by calculating the differential charge densities according to:49 Δρ = Δρtotal(z) − ΔρM2XY(z) − ΔρGeH(z)(8) (9) (10)where Δρtotal, ΔρM2XY, and ΔρGeH are the plane-averaged negative charge densities of the M2XY/GeH vdW heterostructure, the isolated M2XY, and GeH monolayers, respectively. ∑PM2XY, ∑PGeH are the electron gains of the isolated M2XY and GeH monolayers, respectively. c1, c2, and Rcut are the distances of the bottom, top, and differential charge density cut-off positions of the M2XY/GeH vdW heterostructure lattice, respectively.
Results and discussion
The intrinsic monolayers in this research are illustrated in Fig. 1(a and b). The top layer is the Janus M2XY (M = Al, Ga, In; X ≠ Y = S, Se, Te) monolayer and the bottom layer is the GeH monolayer. These monolayers are hexagonal systems with the P63/mmc space group, and the relaxed lattice parameters are shown in Table 1. The HSE06 band structures are illustrated in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Our results are in excellent agreement with the previous research studies.22,24,25,50 To fabricate a stable van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure, the lattice mismatch δ must be evaluated, which can be described by eqn (1). It is noted that the lattice mismatches between the M2XY and GeH monolayers for Ga2SeTe, In2SSe, In2SeTe and In2STe are −2.85%, −2.44%, 2.96%, and 1.15%, respectively. These limited lattice mismatches will be contributed to establish stable vdW heterostructures.16,38

In an ideal vdW heterostructure solar cell system, the application potential of the materials depends on their band structure and absorption properties. Fig. 2 illustrates the corresponding working schematic diagram. The theoretical power conversion efficiency (PCE) η in the limit of 100% external quantum efficiency (EQE) for a type-II heterostructure can be expressed as a function of the band gap of the donor (Edonorg) and the conduction band offset between the donor and acceptor (ΔEc), which are illustrated in eqn (6). Herein, the direct band gap of 1.34 eV was supposed to produce the maximum efficiency.13,51 In addition, the smaller ΔEc tends to bring higher power conversion efficiency. Moreover, for forming vdW heterostructures, the monolayers are subjected to minor strains and weak vdW forces, so their electronic properties can be largely preserved. The properties of monolayers and vdW heterostructures can correspond to each other to some extent. In a word, it is more valuable to establish type-II heterostructures by selecting monolayers with band gaps near 1.34 eV and small ΔEc for solar cell applications.

Because of the structural asymmetry of the Janus monolayers, it is necessary to study the band edges of the top and bottom atoms in the M2XY monolayers. It can be calculated by deducting the electrostatic potential from the energy values at the CBM or VBM eigenstates. Fig. 3 shows the planar average of the electrostatic potential energy (Δφ) along the z direction. Since the X atom shows larger electronegativity than the Y atom in a M2XY monolayer, the X atomic layer side shows higher electrostatic potential, which also contributes to the lower band edge shown in Fig. 4. For example, there is a 0.52 eV potential difference between the S side and Te side in the In2STe monolayer, while the GeH monolayer has the same potential value in the two sides. As a result, the In2STe monolayer has different conduction band minima (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) energy levels relative to the vacuum energy level on the two sides. Moreover, there is a lower conduction band offset between the GeH monolayer and Te side of the In2STe monolayer. These results are consistent with recent studies.22 Furthermore, these monolayers exhibit the anticipated band gaps of around 1.3 eV for solar cell applications. Since vdW heterostructures can preserve the approximate band structure of the monolayers, it is supposed to stack the Te side of the In2STe monolayer onto the GeH monolayer to fabricate type-II heterostructures.

According to the symmetry of the hexagonal lattice, six possible configurations were considered and are shown in Fig. 5.18,35 The configurations (a to c) and (d to f) correspond to stacking the X and Y atomic layers of the M2XY monolayers onto GeH monolayer, respectively. Furthermore, the electronic natures of the monolayers imply that configurations (d to f) heterostructures are more likely to have the expected band structures for solar cell applications.

After structural optimizations for all possible heterostructure configurations, the lattice constants, formation energies, binding energies and energy bands of the most stable configuration among (d to f) and among (a to c) configurations are listed in Table 2 and Table S1 (ESI†), respectively. For the Ga2SeTe/GeH, In2STe/GeH, and In2SeTe/GeH heterostructures, the most stable configuration is (e). It is worth noting that the formation energies of the Ga2SeTe/GeH, In2SSe/GeH, In2STe/GeH, and In2SeTe/GeH heterostructures according to eqn (3) are −187.7 meV, −199.6 meV, −221.9 meV, and −204.7 meV, respectively. The negative formation energy can ensure the feasibility of forming heterostructures from the monolayers.10 Moreover, the binding energies of the Ga2SeTe/GeH, In2SSe/GeH, In2STe/GeH, and In2SeTe/GeH heterostructures according to eqn (4) are 15.3 meV, 15.5 meV, 15.5 meV, and 15.4 meV, respectively. They all have typical vdW interaction binding of around 20 meV Å−2,10 demonstrating that there is vdW interaction between two monolayers.

Fig. 6 illustrates the HSE06 band structures of the most stable M2XY/GeH vdW heterostructures among configurations (d to f). The contributions of the M2XY and GeH layers to the project bands of the vdW heterostructures are indicated by red and blue circles, respectively. The CBM contribution differences between the two layers are also shown. Herein, the PCE can be estimated from the Edonorg and ΔEc, and the vdW heterostructure can largely retain the band structures of the monolayers. Therefore, a vdW heterostructure with a lower CBM contribution difference between two layers should have a higher PCE value. It is noted that the proposed Ga2SeTe/GeH, In2SSe/GeH, and In2STe/GeH vdW heterostructures are all type-II heterostructures with direct band gaps of 1.37 eV, 0.97 eV and 1.25 eV, respectively. In contrast, for configurations (a to c), HSE06 band structures of these vdW heterostructures are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Due to the X atoms having lower band edges than Y atoms, the configurations (a to c) of the vdW heterostructures have higher CBM contribution differences between two layers than configurations (d to f). For instance, the values of the CBM level differences of the most stable Ga2SeTe/GeH, In2SSe/GeH, and In2STe/GeH vdW heterostructures among configurations (a to c) are 0.87 eV, 1.08 eV and 0.64 eV, respectively, which are higher than those values of these most stable vdW heterostructures among configurations (d to f).

To be a good solar light absorber, the material needs to have strong absorption of sunlight in a wide optical wavelength range. The absorption coefficients along the z direction of the type-II Ga2SeTe/GeH, In2SSe/GeH, and In2STe/GeH vdW heterostructures, and the isolated In2STe and GeH monolayers are shown in Fig. 7. It is divided into the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet light areas by black dotted lines. Moreover, the solar spectral irradiance curve for air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5 G) diffuse radiation is drawn at the bottom of Fig. 7.13 It is noted that these vdW heterostructures exhibit broad optical absorptions, especially in the visible and ultraviolet light areas, where the absorption coefficients can reach 5 × 105 cm−1. These results are comparable with Si (1.5 × 105 cm−1),52,53 CH3NH3PbI3 (5 × 105 cm−1)54 and the Ti2CO2/Zr2CO2 vdW heterostructure (6 × 105 cm−1).13 Because more photons can be absorbed by reducing band gaps,16 the In2STe/GeH vdW heterostructure has a higher absorption coefficient than the isolated monolayers. Therefore, the In2STe/GeH vdW heterostructure has outstanding optical properties in application as an efficient solar cell absorber.

Since these vdW heterostructures have been proved to possess suitable band gap structures and excellent optical properties, it is very worthwhile to further evaluate the PCE.
When the two initial monolayers fabricate a vdW heterostructure, they will assemble into a lattice with tiny strains. Taking the In2STe/GeH vdW heterostructure as an example, the changes in band structure brought by strain from lattice mismatch are represented in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Due to the good lattice match, the minor strain induces only −0.11 (−0.07) and 0.2 (0.06) eV changes for CBM (VBM) of In2STe and GeH in the corresponding vdW heterostructure, respectively. Moreover, it exhibits a typical type-II band structure, which can be visualized in Fig. S4 (ESI†).13 The donor and acceptor correspond to the mutually independent monolayers fixed in the lattice of the corresponding vdW heterostructure. In Fig. 8, the GeH monolayer as the donor layer exhibits a direct band gap of 1.48 eV. There is 0.24 eV ΔEc between the In2STe and GeH monolayers to separate charges.45 In addition, the Edonorg and ΔEc for the Ga2SeTe/GeH vdW heterostructures are 1.87 eV and 0.8 eV, respectively. In addition, the values of the Edonorg and ΔEc for the In2SSe/GeH vdW heterostructures are 1.82 eV and 1.04 eV, respectively. When these parameters are entered into eqn (6), the PCE values of the In2STe/GeH, Ga2SeTe/GeH and In2SSe/GeH vdW heterostructures are determined as 18.13%, 8.83% and 5.95%, respectively. Here, the PCE values of these vdW heterostructures have been highlighted as red stars in Fig. 8(c). As listed in Table 3, the calculated PCE value of the In2STe/GeH heterostructure is comparable to some vdW heterostructure solar cells. Therefore, we can infer that the In2STe/GeH vdW heterostructure is an absorber that can be utilized in high-efficiency solar cells.

To further study the stability of the In2STe/GeH vdW heterostructure, the phonon calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were performed. Fig. 9(a) shows the phonon dispersion curves of the In2STe/GeH vdW heterostructure using a 4 × 4 × 1 supercell. The limited imaginary frequency indicates that the In2STe/GeH vdW heterostructure exhibits good lattice dynamical stability. Furthermore, Fig. 9(b) illustrates that the total energy of the In2STe/GeH vdW heterostructure fluctuates within a very small range at 300 K. The structure is also retained after 9 ps thermal vibration. In addition, we investigated the thermal stability of the In2STe/GeH vdW heterostructure at higher temperatures, which is shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). It should be noted that the heterostructure can be well maintained at 600 K. However, it is broken down at 900 K. The results reveal that the In2STe/GeH vdW heterostructure has good thermal and dynamic stability, which provides a theoretical prediction for the successful synthesis of the material.

During the solar cell operation, the absorption captures light energy to create photo-excited electrons to conduct current. Therefore, since the In2STe/GeH vdW heterostructure exhibits the prospected simulated PCE values, it is important to evaluate the carrier properties. The carrier mobility μ of the In2STe/GeH vdW heterostructure and its isolated monolayers are listed in Table 4. Interestingly, for the In2STe and GeH monolayers, the electron mobility is significantly larger than that of the hole, both along the x and y directions (from 30 to 70 times larger). The In2STe monolayer has almost isotropic carrier mobility in the x and y directions, while the electron mobility along the x direction of the GeH monolayer is two times larger than that along the y direction. For the In2STe/GeH vdW heterostructure, the electron mobilities along the x (130.06 cm2 V−1 s−1) and y (25.65 cm2 V−1 s−1) directions are nearly 15 times larger than that of the hole mobilities along the x (8.18 cm2 V−1 s−1) and y (1.52 cm2 V−1 s−1) directions. In addition, the In2STe/GeH vdW heterostructure is directionally anisotropic, whose electron and hole mobilities in the y direction are about 5 times higher than those in the x direction. The high and directionally anisotropic carrier mobility of the In2STe/GeH vdW heterostructure contributes to the effective separation of the electron–hole pairs,59 indicating that the In2STe/GeH vdW heterostructure has great potential for high efficiency solar cells.

Furthermore, charge rearrangement occurs when the two interfaces of the monolayers make contact. Hence, a built-in electric field will be formed to affect the transport properties of the carriers. Fig. 10 illustrates the differential charge density of the In2STe/GeH vdW heterostructure along the z-direction, which is calculated by eqn (8). The two vertical dashed lines in Fig. 10(a) correspond to the positions of the atoms in the contact interface of the two monolayers. In the interface area, an accumulation of electrons is close to the GeH monolayer, while a depletion of electrons is close to the In2STe monolayer. Moreover, to determine the amount of electron transfer, the regions of the interface belonging to In2STe or GeH must be specified. Following the previous works,39,49 we define a GeH–In2STe cutoff distance Rcut as the distance at the zero point of Δρ in the interface between the GeH and In2STe monolayers. The region belonging to the GeH monolayer is z < Rcut, and the region with z > Rcut is assigned to the In2STe monolayer.

The schematic of the movement of charge carrier based on the (b) band alignment and (c) built-in electric field in the In2STe/GeH vdW heterostructure. The inset image on the left of (a) shows the 3D isosurface differential charge densities of the In2STe/GeH vdW heterostructure, where the yellow and blue contours represent the electron accumulation and depletion, respectively. The inset image on the right of (a) is the schematic of the built-in electric field of the In2STe/GeH vdW heterostructure. 
Based on eqn (9) and (10), the GeH monolayer gains electrons while the In2STe monolayer loses electrons, forming a built-in electric field from In2STe to GeH. The results are shown in Table S2 (ESI†). In addition, the electron transfer can be quantitatively analyzed by the Bader charges.60 The results show that the GeH monolayer gains 0.012e electrons compared to the ground state.
As shown in the schematic illustration in Fig. 10(b and c), the effects of promoting the charge carrier motion are consistent for electric field and band arrangements. Therefore, the built-in electric field is conducive to the photocurrent conduction of the In2STe/GeH vdW heterostructure, which improves the potential application in solar cells.
Due to the capability of strain engineering to adjust the band gaps, the PCE may be enhanced by applying plane strain to the vdW heterostructures.14Fig. 11 illustrates the changes of the calculated band edges under 5% compressive strain to 5% tensile strain by using the HSE06 function. It should be noted that the CBM and VBM of the materials are decreased with the expansion of the lattice. In addition, the band edge variations caused by the biaxial strain are more significant than that by the uniaxial strain. Due to the symmetry of the hexagonal lattice, strains along the x and y directions cause nearly identical band edge variations. In the whole strain process, the two monolayers maintain the direct band gap at the Γ point. Simultaneously, due to the CBMs falling faster than VBMs, the band gaps of the two monolayers decrease with the expansion of the lattice, especially for the GeH monolayer. Moreover, the CBMs of the GeH monolayer are higher than that of the In2SeTe monolayer. As a result, the ΔEc In2STe/GeH of the vdW heterostructure decreases. The PCE changes with the changing band edge are illustrated in Fig. 12. For compressive strain, PCE decreases with the increase of strain, showing no benefit to the photovoltaic properties. For the tensile strain, PCE first increases and then decreases as the strain increases, and it has a greater effect on the biaxial strain than the uniaxial strain. Interestingly, the maximum PCE of the In2STe/GeH vdW heterostructure is 19.71% under 3% uniaxial compressive strain, and that for the biaxial strain is 18.71% under 2% compressive strain. Therefore, strain engineering is proposed to enhance the photovoltaic properties for the In2STe/GeH vdW heterostructure.

Conclusions
In summary, we have studied the potential of applying vdW heterostructures fabricated by Janus M2XY (M = Al, Ga, In; X ≠ Y = S, Se, Te) and GeH monolayers to solar cells. Firstly, small lattice mismatches of Ga2SeTe, In2SSe, In2SeTe, and In2STe with the GeH monolayers indicate that they could be established as stable heterostructures. Moreover, due to the structural asymmetry of the Janus monolayers, staking the Y atomic layer of Janus M2XY onto the GeH monolayers would contribute to a smaller conduction band offset. By evaluating the formation energy, binding energy, and energy band gap, Ga2SeTe/GeH, In2SSe/GeH, and In2STe/GeH have been proved to be stable vdW heterostructures with type-II band edge alignment. Moreover, these three vdW heterostructures have great optical properties in the visible and ultraviolet light areas. Furthermore, the In2STe/GeH vdW heterostructure exhibits 18.13% theoretical power conversion efficiency (PCE). The thermal and dynamic stability of the In2STe/GeH vdW heterostructure have also been proved by phonon and AIMD calculations. It has high and directional anisotropic carrier mobility, which can contribute to the separation and propagation of photogenic electron–hole pairs. In addition, the built-in electric field from In2STe to GeH can promote photocurrent conduction in the In2STe/GeH vdW heterostructure. Finally, by strain engineering in the biaxial and uniaxial directions, the maximum PCE of the In2STe/GeH vdW heterostructure can reach 19.71% under 3% uniaxial compressive strain.
