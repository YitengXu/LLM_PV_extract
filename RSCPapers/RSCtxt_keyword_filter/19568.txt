Structures of 1, 2 and 4 have been obtained by single crystal X-ray diffraction. These complexes with pyridyl, piperonyl and furfuryl as heteroaromatic groups in the dithiocarbamate ligands have been exploited as sensitizers in dye sensitized TiO2 solar cells for converting sunlight into electrical energy. Light-to-electrical energy conversion efficiencies achieved using these sensitizers are considerably greater than those obtained with analogous compounds previously reported by us. The overall conversion efficiency (η) is found to be dependent upon the nature of the heteroaromatic conjugated linkers and increases in the order η (ferrocenylfurfuryl) > η (ferrocenylpiperonyl) > η (ferrocenylpyridyl) all values being lower than that obtained in the reference Ru dye N719 under similar experimental conditions. The conversion efficiencies also vary with the metal being higher for Ni (4, 5 and 6) than for Cu complexes (1, 2 and 3). The X-ray structural analyses reveal the existence of rare M⋯H–C intermolecular anagostic interactions involving the metal atom in chain motifs in 1 and 4, which are retained in solution as evidenced by 1H NMR spectroscopy.
Introduction
The design, synthesis and development of sensitizers to harness sunlight into electrical energy are very important in solar technology. Since the advent of ruthenium(II) diimine sensitizers, there has been remarkable advancement in both inorganic, nanostructures, organometallic1 and organic2 sensitizers. The dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) employing these efficient ruthenium based sensitizers have shown potential to become viable alternatives for the silicon based photovoltaic cells; the highest conversion efficiency (η) reported so far for the ruthenium sensitizers3 is η ≈ 11%. Although ruthenium diimine complexes have several advantages, the metal (Ru) is highly expensive and is in short supply which limits its large scale application.
In recent years some specifically designed heteroaromatic conjugated organic compounds and metal phthalocyanine dyes4 have been developed which have shown attractive conversion efficiencies. The excited state and photophysical properties of square planar Ni(II), Pd(II), and Pt(II) heteroleptic complexes involving diimine/diphosphine and dianionic 1,1- and 1,2-dithio ligands have been extensively studied;5 and some of them have been tested for their light harvesting properties also.6 In these compounds the excited state involves the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) which consists of a mixture of metal and dithiolate orbital character and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is a π* orbital of the diimine. In the majority of cases the emissive state has been assigned to metal-to-π* and ILCT/LLCT charge transfer. It is worth mentioning that when compared to Pt(II) complexes, which are highly emissive, the corresponding Ni(II), Pd(II) and Cu(II) complexes are generally weakly or non-emissive because of their well known quenching behaviour7 due to the occurrence of low energy bands in the visible region. Transition metal dithiocarbamate complexes are important because of their multifaceted chemistry and applications in diverse areas such as materials chemistry, industry and agriculture.8 The majority of the DSSCs based on Ru(II) and Pt(II) polypyridyl complex sensitizers have so far utilized the carboxylate (R-COOH) functionality appropriate for anchoring onto the TiO2 semiconductor.1f,h A few zinc–porphyrin dyes with the pyridine ring as an efficient anchoring group have been employed in DSSCs for light harvesting reactions.9 Ferrocene based compounds including dithio derivatives with two potential sulphur donors are important because of their interesting electrochemical and optical properties, uses as precursors in organic and organometallic chemistry and numerous applications.10 Our group has obtained good “light-to-electrical” energy conversion efficiencies for some ferrocene based dithiocarbamate sensitizers.11 Among these the Ni based dyes have achieved the best values of conversion efficiencies. Recently some heteroleptic Ni(II) complexes of polypyridine and quinoxaline-2,3-dithiolate have been used as sensitizers in TiO2 solar cells.12 Keeping these points in mind and encouraged by these recent studies it was considered worthwhile to synthesize some complexes of electroactive Ni(II) and Cu(II) metal ions utilizing ferrocene based dithiocarbamate ligands such as potassium (ferrocenylmethyl) (furan-2-ylmethyl)dithiocarbamate (KL1), potassium(benzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-ylmethyl)(benzyl)(ferrocenylmethyl)dithiocarbamate (KL2), and potassium (ferrocenylmethyl)(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)dithiocarbamate (KL3) containing anchoring pyridyl group9 and heteroaromatic piperonyl or furfuryl groups to test their photosensitizing activities in dye sensitized TiO2 solar cells. Albeit the metal ions Ni(II) and Cu(II), with 3d8 and 3d9 configurations, respectively, differ significantly with respect to their electronic and structural properties and chemical reactivity, both show a strong tendency to form square planar complexes with dithioligands. Furthermore the current increasing interest in these systems stems from promising features such as (i) the robustness of one electron redox behaviour of the ferrocene entity, (ii) the strong electronic communication between the ferrocene units through the spacer group, i.e. planar metal dithiocomplexes, (iii) their absorption characteristics in the visible region, and (iv) the easy structural modification with varying functionalities on the ferrocene dithiocarbamate unit. The results of these investigations are described here.
Results and discussion
The new ferrocenyl based dithiocarbamate complexes of Cu(II) and Ni(II) were prepared according to Scheme 1. The ferrocene functionalized secondary amines were obtained by condensation reaction of the ferrocene carboxaldehyde with an amine containing a heteroaromatic ring to give the corresponding imine, followed by its subsequent reduction. From these ferrocenyl containing secondary amines, the potassium salts of the dithiocarbamate ligands were prepared using KOH and carbon disulfide in equimolar ratio. The portion-wise addition of nickel acetate or copper acetate to a methanol solution of the dithiocarbamate ligand resulted in the formation of green to brown coloured solids. All the compounds are air-stable and melt/decompose in the 170–236 °C temperature range. These complexes have been characterized by microanalyses, and the structures of 1, 2 and 4 have been elucidated by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The electrochemical and light harvesting properties of all six compounds in dye sensitized TiO2 solar cells have also been investigated.

Solid-state structures
Single crystals of complexes (1, 2 and 4) were obtained by slow evaporation of dichloromethane–acetonitrile solutions. Crystallographic details are listed (Table S1, ESI†) and dimensions in the metal coordination spheres are given in Table 1. The structures of 1, 2 and 4 are shown in Fig. 1–3. In spite of our best efforts X-ray quality single crystals of complexes 3, 5 and 6 could not be obtained. All three complexes (1, 2 and 4) contain a crystallographic centre of symmetry. Complexes 1 and 4 are isomorphous. In all three complexes, the MS4 unit is perforce planar. The square planar geometry is distorted only by the small S–M–S bite angle of 77.19(7), 77.69(3), and 79.18(6)° in 1, 2 and 4 respectively. In 1 and 2, the Cu(1)–S(1) and Cu(1)–S(2) distances of 2.268(2), 2.287(1), and 2.307(2), 2.303(1) Å and the Ni(1)–S(1) and Ni(1)–S(2) distances of 2.192(2) and 2.210(2) Å in 4 are compatible with values in analogous Cu(II) and Ni(II) dithiocomplexes.11b

It is to be noted that in all three structures S(2) is the same side as the ferrocenyl substituted ligand with S(2)–C(1)–N(1)–C(21) torsion angles of 2.5(8), 3.1(8), and 0.8(4)° respectively. Further, it is interesting to note that the bond from the metal to S(2) is longer than that to S(1) in all the three cases, but the reason for this is not clear. The atoms Cu(1)/Ni(1), S(1), S(2), C(1) in the four membered chelate ring are approximately planar, showing r.m.s. deviations of 0.006, 0.034 and 0.002 Å respectively in 1, 2 and 4. The N(1)–C(1) bond lengths of 1.324(7), 1.330(3) and 1.312(7) Å in 1, 2 and 4 respectively are intermediate between single and double bond lengths, thus indicating partial double bond character. The C(1)–S(1) bond lengths ≈1.71 Å are shorter than the typical C–S single bond length (1.82 Å) due to partial π-conjugation over the N–C–S group. The intraligand S(1)⋯S(2) separations of 2.854(3), 2.878(1) and 2.806(2) Å for 1, 2 and 4, respectively, are shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii (3.60 Å) of two sulphur atoms suggesting substantial non-bonded intramolecular S⋯S interactions.
Complexes 1 and 4 are isomorphous and so have the same stacking pattern. More importantly, the packing effects and less sterically hindered methylene group on the dithiocarbamate moiety together with the electronic requirements of square planar Ni(II), d8 and Cu(II), d9 allow one methylene proton in each furfuryl group to be in close proximity to the vacant axial position around the centrosymmetric metal atom thereby resulting in a chain of rare C–H⋯M intermolecular anagostic or preagostic binding interactions13 in both 1 and 4, C–H⋯Cu: 2.79 Å, ∠C–H⋯Cu: 150° and C–H⋯Ni: 2.69 Å, ∠C–H⋯Ni: 151°. The C–H bond makes angles of 11° and 9° respectively with the equatorial planes in 1 and 4. These interactions (Fig. 4) are slightly stronger in the nickel complex 4 than the copper complex 1. Such interactions are not common, but have previously been stabilized in group 10 metal dithiocomplexes.14
 Fig. 4  (a) Linear molecular chains formed via head to head Cu⋯H–C interactions in 1. (b) The linear molecular chain formed via head to head Ni⋯H–C interactions in 4. (c) Chain of dimers formed via π⋯π interactions in 2. The black circles represent centroids of the five-membered rings. 
To the best of our knowledge, these are the first examples of rare anagostic interactions in ferrocenyl based metal dithiocomplexes. These types of interactions occurring in square planar transition metal complexes are of immense interest due to their possible implications for the mechanism of C–H bond activation.15 Unlike 1, such interactions are not observed in the Cu(II) complex 2 because the pronounced steric hindrance of the bulky piperonyl group restricts the ability of the methylene protons on the dithiocarbamate moiety to approach metal atoms in the vacant axial positions. As a result the packing of the complex in the crystal is stabilized by weaker π⋯π interactions.
Cyclic voltammetry
The electrochemical redox behaviour of all the complexes was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) at the Pt electrode in dichloromethane solution containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) as the supporting electrolyte and the results obtained at different scan rates are shown in Fig. 5 for nickel and in Fig. S1, ESI,† for copper complexes. All the complexes show virtually similar voltammograms with a single quasi-reversible oxidation wave due to the dominant redox-active ferrocenyl unit having the formal redox potentials in the range of 0.23–0.34 V vs. Ag/Ag+ (CH3CN) (Table S2, ESI†). Their redox potentials are anodically shifted in comparison to that of the ferrocene standard (E° = 0.19 V), thereby suggesting an electron withdrawing effect of the pendant groups attached to the ferrocene fragment. The appearance of a single quasi-reversible wave indicates that the two ferrocenyl units are oxidized in a single step and are electrochemically equivalent. The nickel complexes (4–6) show superior efficiencies than the copper complexes (1–3), probably because in the nickel complexes having furfuryl, piperonyl and pyridyl substituents with electron withdrawing character on the dithiocarbamate unit, the redox potential shift is at a higher potential side than the corresponding copper complexes. Also, the higher planarity of the nickel(II), 3d8 complexes in comparison to copper(II), 3d9 complexes enhances the adsorption of the nickel dyes on the TiO2 surface than the copper complexes, in turn increasing the efficiencies of the nickel complexes (4–6) than the copper complexes. The higher efficiency of nickel complexes than the copper and other metal dithiocarbamate complexes was also observed in a previous report.11b
 Fig. 5  Cyclic voltammograms of 10−3 M dichloromethane solutions of compounds 4, 5 and 6 recorded at different scan rates 40–100 mV s−1. 0.1 M Bu4NClO4 was used as a supporting electrolyte. 
The copper complex 2 having the pendant piperonyl group on the dithiocarbamate unit is slightly more anodically shifted (Table S2, ESI†) but relatively less planar than the copper complex 1 having the furfuryl pendant group and thus shows a somewhat inferior conversion efficiency (vide infra, the current potential curve, Table 3). This trend of conversion efficiency is uniformly associated with the planarity of the dye molecules11b (vide supra, X-ray crystallography). Nevertheless in the case of copper complexes 1, 2 and 3, the more facile one electron, Cu(II)/Cu(III) oxidation and reduction peak due to the copper dithiocarbamate fragment16 in the same vicinity is suppressed by the dominant redox active ferrocene centre resulting in a somewhat broad peak as compared to the corresponding nickel complexes. For all complexes, the peak potential separation (ΔEp) and peak current ratio (Jp,a/Jp,c) were not found to satisfy the condition for the reversible one electron transfer process, indicating thereby the involvement of the EC mechanism.
UV-visible spectroscopy
Optical properties are the most important deciding factors for the utility of a compound to act as a photosensitizer. The UV-vis absorption characteristics of all the compounds in dichloromethane solution and in the solid as nujol mulls are almost equivalent, thus indicating that their structures are retained in solution. They absorb light in the visible range of 400–500 nm (molar extinction coefficients, as given in Table 2) with slightly more bathochromic shifts for copper complexes (Fig. 6) than nickel complexes characteristic of the ferrocene moiety and LMCT transitions from the ligand (S) to metal [Cu(II)/Ni(II)] orbital.17 All the complexes exhibit a weak broad band around 650 nm which is assigned to a d–d transition consistent with the square planar geometry around Cu(II) and Ni(II).11b

The UV-vis absorption spectra of complexes (1–6) on TiO2 thin film exhibit a moderately weak broad band between 380 and 520 nm (Fig. 6b), almost similar to the absorption spectrum of the respective complex in solution but with a slight blue shift. This result revealed the successful adsorption of these sensitizers on nanoporous TiO2 film.
Photosensitization

Energy-levels for the cell components. 
The thermodynamic feasibility of electron injection by a photo-excited dye molecule into the conduction band of the semiconductor electrode and regeneration of the dye molecule from its oxidized form were primarily ascertained on the basis of the relative positions of the electron exchange energy levels of the cell components. The formal redox potential of the complex determined by cyclic voltammetry provided the electron donating energy level of the compound in its ground state (ED). This coupled with the excitation energy of the compound corresponding to its λmax provides the electron transfer energy level of the excited dye molecule ED*. The ED* being above the lower edge of the conduction band of the semiconductor electrode ensures the thermodynamic feasibility of the photo-induced electron injection. Further, the redox potential of I−/I3− in propylene carbonate (the medium of the cell electrolyte) being above the ED ensures the regeneration of dye molecules from its oxidized form (D+ + I− → D + 1/2I2).

Current–potential curve
The sandwich type cells (TiO2–dye/electrolyte containing I−/I3−/Pt counter electrode) were fabricated using different dyes (1–6) and their J–V curves were determined under illumination with 100 mW cm−2 light intensity (Fig. 7). The cell output parameters, namely, short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open circuit potential (Voc), fill factor (FF), and overall light to electrical energy conversion efficiency (η) derived from these curves, are given in Table 3. Although the overall conversion efficiencies achieved with the use of compounds 1–6 are lower than that of N719 under identical experimental conditions, these values are quite encouraging. It is to be noted that better photovoltaic performances have been achieved for these Ni(II) based ferrocenyl dithiocarbamate dyes in comparison to previously reported11b metal dithio sensitizers under virtually identical experimental conditions. The efficiencies of complexes (1–6) may be associated with the electronic properties of the pyridyl,9 furfuryl and piperonyl functionalities in the dithiocarbamate ligands together with the planarity of the dye molecules; the higher the planarity,11b more is the adsorption of the dyes on TiO2 and higher the conversion efficiency.

Power conversion efficiency (η) and fill factor (FF)
For determining the power output and related parameters of the dye sensitized PEC cells, the photocurrent–potential curves determined under illumination with 100 mW cm−2 (Fig. 7) have been used. The fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (η) are evaluated using the following relationships: (1) (2)Here Jsc, Voc and Iinc are short-circuit photocurrent, open-circuit potential and intensity of incident light respectively. The η and FF values calculated from these equations for different cells are given in Table 3.
Photocurrent action spectrum (IPCE–λ)
In order to ascertain unambiguously the sensitization of photocurrent by the dyes under investigation, the short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) spectra of bare and dye modified TiO2 electrodes were determined. Since the total photocurrent obtained under illumination with IR-filtered light (still having UV part) is likely to be contributed partly by the semiconductor (TiO2) electrode (as it can be excited by high energy photons of the UV part of light), the exclusive contribution of the dye/complex can be obtained by determining the photocurrent spectrum (IPCE vs. λ) in the visible region because only the dye/complex, not TiO2 (band gap 3.2 eV), can absorb in the visible range and generate photocurrent. From the values of Jsc and the intensity of the corresponding monochromatic light (Iinc), the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was calculated at each excitation wavelength (λ) using the following relationship: (3)
The action spectra (% IPCE vs. λ) thus obtained for TiO2 electrodes coated with different complexes (1–6) are shown in Fig. 8. The close resemblance of the nature of the absorption spectrum of the complex to the respective action spectrum confirms the sensitization of the photocurrent by dye. Further, in each case the maximum IPCE value is observed at the characteristic wavelength (λmax) of the complex. This indicates that there is no aggregation of the complex molecules on the surface of the TiO2 film. The maximum IPCE values observed at the characteristic wavelengths of the complexes are 42, 39, 35, 50, 46 and 48 for complexes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, respectively (Table 3).

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
For investigating the electron transport properties of the TiO2–dye–electrolyte interface in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has been used. In EIS the study of the semicircle in the middle frequency region is associated with the electron/charge transfer at the TiO2–dye–electrode interface.18–21 The EIS Nyquist plots of the DSSCs based on the TiO2–dye–electrolyte interface are shown in Fig. 9. According to the EIS spectra shown in Fig. 9, the charge-transfer resistance for the TiO2–dye–electrolyte interface decreases with decreasing the semicircle diameter. The charge transfer resistance decreases with the dyes in the following trend: 3 > 2 > 1 > 6 > 5 > 4 at the TiO2–dye–electrolyte interface. The study of EIS spectra is in good agreement with the highest and lowest efficiency of the 4 and 3 dyes respectively.

Conclusions
In this contribution six ferrocenyl bearing planar Ni(II) and Cu(II) dithiocarbamate complexes with varying functionalities on the dithiocarbamate fragment have been synthesized and fully characterized by spectroscopic techniques and X-ray crystallography. These complexes have been exploited as sensitizers in dye sensitized TiO2 solar cells, taking advantage of their quasi-reversible redox behaviour, electronic absorption features in the visible region together with the presence of heteroaromatic groups on the ligands. The Ni complexes 4, 5 and 6 showed comparatively higher light to electrical energy conversion efficiencies (3.87, 3.46, and 3.69% respectively) than copper complexes 1, 2 and 3 (3.14, 2.80, and 2.59% respectively). These efficiencies are remarkably enhanced in comparison to previously reported sensitizers from our group because of the suitable orientation of the ferrocenyl groups in these dyes, one of the ferrocenyl fragments acts as an antenna for light harvesting and the pyridyl9 anchors onto the TiO2 semiconductor in 3 and 6 whereas in the case of the sensitizers 1, 2, 3 and 4 having heteroaromatic furfuryl and piperonyl groups, the remote interfacial electron transfer may be suggested1e,h as one of the ferrocenyl fragments acts as an antenna for light harvesting and the other ferrocenyl group anchors onto the TiO2 surface.11b Furthermore, the sensitizers anchored to TiO2 through non-chromophoric ligands or without a direct chemical bond may also act as potential sensitizers via efficient remote interfacial electron transfer from supramolecular sensitizers.1e,h These studies demonstrate the scope for development of cost effective ferrocenyl based dithiocomplex sensitizers with structural and electronic modifications on the thio functions. As far as we are aware 1 and 4 are unique examples of ferrocene based planar dithiocomplexes which contain unusual M⋯H–C intermolecular anagostic interactions in their crystal structures.
Experimental section
General details
Reagent grade chemicals were purchased from commercial sources and used as such. The synthesis of the compounds was carried out under an inert-gas atmosphere of N2. Solvents were purified and dried before use according to standard literature procedures. Acetonitrile (ACN) (Spectrochem, HPLC grade), used as the medium of the electrolyte solution, was purified as described earlier.22 Propylene carbonate (Merck), used as the medium of the cell electrolyte solution (Merck), anhydrous Bu4NClO4 (Purum, Fluka) supporting electrolyte, LiI (Aldrich), and I2 (BDH) redox couple were used without any further purification. Dichloromethane (DCM) was used as the medium of solution for obtaining cyclic voltammograms of dyes. Titanium paste (HT) used for preparing the TiO2 electrode, platinum catalyst (T/SP) for the counter electrode and the sealing agent (SX1170-60, 50 μm) were obtained from Solaronix. Experimental details pertaining to microanalysis are the same as those described previously.11b The ESI-mass spectra of complexes 3, 5, and 6 were obtained on an Agilent 6310 Ion Trap mass spectrometer. Cyclic voltammograms of the complexes were obtained using a bipotentiostat (model no. AFRDE 4E, Pine Instrument Company, USA) and an e-Corder (model 201, eDAQ, Australia). For this purpose, a 10−3 M dichloromethane solution of the complexes was used with a 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate supporting electrolyte. The reference electrode was Ag/Ag+ (in acetonitrile) and a platinum wire was used as the working electrode. For photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements, a 150 W xenon arc lamp (Oriel Corporation, USA) was used as the light source and the semiconductor electrode was illuminated after passing the light beam through a 6 inch long water column (to filter IR) and condensing it with the help of fused silica lenses (Oriel Corporation, USA). The light was monochromatized, when required, by using a grating monochromator (Oriel Model 77250 equipped with model 7798 grating). The width of the exit slit of the monochromator was kept at 0.5 mm. To obtain the action spectrum (Jphoto–λ) of the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode, monochromatic light-induced photocurrent was measured with the help of a digital multimeter (Philips model no. 2525) in combination with the potentiostat. The intensities of light were measured with a digital photometer (Tektronix model J16 with model J 6502 sensor) in combination with neutral density filters (model no. 50490-50570, Oriel, USA). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed on a CH 660C electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments, Shanghai, China) in a two electrode configuration. The photoanode was used as a working electrode and the Pt electrode as a counter electrode. The electron transport properties were investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with 10 mV ac signal in the frequency range of 102–105 Hz.

Preparation of the TiO2 electrode (photoanode), the counter electrode and the electrolyte. 
TiO2 thin film electrodes (photoanode) were prepared by spreading highly transparent paste of TiO2 (titanium-HT) on a conductive glass plate (15 Ω cm−2, Pilkington, USA) by the doctor's blade method and annealed at 450 °C for half an hour in air. The dye was attached to the TiO2 surface by immersing for 8 h the TiO2 coated electrodes in dichloromethane solution of the dye(s). The non-adsorbed dye was washed with anhydrous ethanol. The platinum counter electrode was prepared by deposition of Pt catalyst T/SP paste on another conductive glass and annealed at 400 °C for half an hour in air. The electrolyte consisted of 0.2 M lithium iodide mixed with 0.02 M iodine in propylene carbonate.


DSSC assembly. 
DSSCs were assembled by placing the platinum catalyst-coated counter electrode on the top of a dye-coated TiO2 electrode, and using a sealant the cell was sealed on three sides leaving one side open for the injection of electrolyte solution. The iodine/iodide electrolyte solution was placed at the edges of the plates. The electrolyte was drawn into the space between the electrodes by capillary action. With the help of araldite the remaining open part of the cell assembly was sealed and the contact was made by copper wire using silver paste and then sealed with araldite (Fig. 10).

Crystallography. 
For crystal 1, data were collected at 293 K on a Bruker SMART diffractometer system equipped with graphite monochromated Mo-Kα radiation, λ = 0.71073 Å. The final unit cell determination, scaling of the data, and corrections for Lorentz and polarization effects were performed with the SAINT program.23 For crystals 2 and 4 the intensity data were collected at 298 K on a Sapphire2-CCD, OXFORD diffractometer system equipped with graphite monochromated Mo-Kα radiation, λ = 0.71073 Å. The final unit cell determination, scaling of the data, and corrections for Lorentz and polarization effects were performed with CrysAlis RED.24 For all three crystals, symmetry related (multiscan) absorption corrections were applied. Structure determinations followed by full-matrix least squares refinement on F2 were performed using the WINGX-1.70 suite25 of programs. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically; hydrogen atoms were located at calculated positions and refined using a riding model with isotropic thermal parameters fixed at 1.2 times the Ueq value of the appropriate carrier atom.


Synthesis of potassium salts of ligands (KL1–KL3): potassium(ferrocenylmethyl)(furan-2-ylmethyl)dithiocarbamate (KL1). 
Ferrocene carboxaldehyde (0.107 g, 0.5 mmol) and furfurylamine (0.047 g, 0.5 mmol) were dissolved in 5 mL ethanol and the mixture was refluxed for 5 h. The mixture was kept in an ice bath and reduced with NaBH4 in methanol and the product was extracted with dichloromethane (50 mL) and washed thrice with water (3 × 25 mL). An oily yellow solid was collected on solvent removal. The resulting 1-ferrocenyl-N-(furan-2-ylmethyl) methanamine was dissolved in a THF–ACN mixture (50:50 v/v), and then KOH (0.028 g, 0.5 mmol) followed by CS2 (0.076 g, 1 mmol) were added. The mixture was stirred for 2 h. The solvent was removed under vacuum and the product was washed with diethyl ether (3 × 15 mL). A light yellow solid product was obtained, yield: 0.170 g, 83%. 1H NMR (300.40 MHz, CDCl3): δH 7.41 (d, 1H, C4H3O), 6.30 (m, 2H, C4H3O), 5.38 (s, 2H, CH2C4H3O), 5.09 (s, 2H, CH2Fc), δ 4.44–4.18 (m, 4H, Fc), δ 3.89 (s, 5H, Fc) and 13C{1H} NMR (75.45 MHz, CDCl3): δ 214.1 (CS2) 152.4, 141.4 (–C4H3O), 110.3, 107.4 (Fc), δ 48.6 (–CH2Fc), δ 46.2 (–CH2C4H3O), IR (KBr, cm−1): 1320 ν (CN), 1011–1025 ν (C–S).


Potassium(benzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-ylmethyl)(ferrocenyl methyl)dithiocarbamate (KL2). 
Ferrocenecarboxaldehyde (0.107 g, 0.5 mmol) and piperonylamine (0.075 g, 0.5 mmol) were dissolved in 5 mL toluene and the mixture was refluxed for 6 h. The Dean–Stark apparatus was used to remove water from the reaction mixture in order to facilitate the completion of the reaction. Toluene was vacuum evaporated and the oily solid thus obtained was dissolved in dry methanol (25 mL). This was kept in an ice bath and reduced with NaBH4 under an inert atmosphere of N2 with continuous stirring for 2 h and the product was extracted into dichloromethane (50 mL) and washed thrice with water (2 × 25 mL). The yellowish oily-solid thus obtained was dissolved in THF–ACN (50:50 v/v, 10 mL), and KOH (0.028 g, 0.5 mmol) and CS2 (0.076 g, 1 mmol) were added in an ice cold condition. The reaction mixture was further stirred for 2 h. The solvent was removed under vacuum and the yellow product thus obtained was washed with diethyl ether and dried under vacuum. Yield: 0.177 g, 76%. 1H NMR (300.40 MHz, CDCl3, ppm): δH 6.77–6.72 (–C6H4CH2O2), 5.99 (s, 2H, –CH2C6H4O2), 5.12 (s, 2H, CH2C7H6O2), 4.95 (s, 2H, –CH2Fc), 4.49–4.19 (m, 4H, Fc) 4.03 (s, 5H, Fc), and 13C{1H} NMR (75.45 MHz, CDCl3, ppm): δ 215.3 (CS2), 146.9, 145.6, 134.5, 120.5 (–C6H4CH2O2), 108.3, 107.6, 100.6 (Fc), 49.3 (–CH2Fc), 47.2 (–CH2C6H5O2), IR (KBr): 1319 ν (CN), 1011–989 ν (C–S).


Potassium(ferrocenylmethyl)(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)dithiocarbamate (KL3). 
This yellowish orange ligand was synthesized and isolated by a similar method to that used for the synthesis of KL2 using picolyl-2-amine (0.053 g, 0.5 mmol). Yield: 0.165 g, 78%. 1H NMR (300.40 MHz, CDCl3): δH 8.27 (d, 2H, C5H4N), 7.04–6.48 (m, 3H, C5H4N), 5.22 (s, 2H, CH2C5H4N), 5.03 (s, 2H; FcCH2), 4.37–4.24 (m, 4H, Fc), 4.17 (s, 5H, Fc), and 13C{1H} NMR (75.45 MHz, CDCl3): δ 215.0 (CS2), 154.3, 148.7, 136.8, 122.8 (–C5H4N), 52.4 (–CH2Fc), 108.3, 106.6, 101.3 (Fc), 48.3 (–CH2C5H4N), IR (KBr): 1285 ν (CN), 1012–1027 ν (C–S).


Synthesis of complexes (1–6). 
The complexes were prepared according to the general procedure. To a 10 mL methanolic solution of the ligand KL1 (0.204 g, 0.5 mmol), KL2 (0.231 g, 0.5 mmol) or KL3 (0.210 g, 0.5 mmol) was added slowly a 5 mL solution of Ni(CO2CH3)2·4H2O (0.063 g, 0.25 mmol) or Cu(CO2CH3)2·H2O (0.050 g, 0.25 mmol) with continuous stirring for about 4 h. The solvent was vacuum evaporated and the solid was extracted with dichloromethane and washed with water followed by brine. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and then filtered to collect the filtrate. The solvent was removed to leave a solid product.
