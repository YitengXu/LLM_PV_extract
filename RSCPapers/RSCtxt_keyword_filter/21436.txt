    , Accepted 10th March 2015First published on 10th March 2015AbstractA push–pull thienoquinoidal chromophore, 4,4′-((4-((5-(dicyanomethylene)thiophen-2(5H)-ylidene) methyl)phenyl) azanediyl) dibenzoic acid (QT-1), was synthesized and used as a sensitizer in a p-DSC, giving a short-circuit photocurrent density of 8.2 mA cm−2 under standard AM 1.5 conditions.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have been intensively investigated as one of the most promising alternatives to conventional silicon-based devices owing to their potential low production costs and high conversion efficiencies.1 In a typical DSC, an n-type semiconductor electrode (usually, TiO2) is sensitized as an active photoanode in combination with a passive platinized cathode. In this n-DSC, light-induced electrons are injected from the excited sensitizer into the conduction band of TiO2, followed by hole injection into an electrolyte (usually containing an I−/I3− based redox couple), where the photovoltage is defined by the difference in chemical potential between the TiO2 photoanode and the electrolyte. As for a p-DSC using a p-type semiconductor (such as NiO), an inverse mode occurs, that is, dye-excitation is followed by rapid electron transfer from the p-type semiconductor to the sensitizer, where the photovoltage is decided by the difference in chemical potential between the NiO photocathode and the electrolyte.2 Thus, it is expected that a tandem solar cell can be constructed using both the active electrodes in a single device (np-DSC),3 leading to a high open-circuit voltage, namely a sum of the photovoltages obtained in the corresponding p and n devices, and thus potentially enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE). So far, however, high efficiencies have not been obtained as expected in such tandem DSCs, mainly due to the poor performance of p-DSCs.2,3
In an np-DSC with the given electrodes, in principle, the maximum possible open-circuit voltage (Voc) that can be delivered is directly related to the energy difference between the conduction band of the n-type semiconductor and the valence band of the p-type counterpart. Thus, maximizing short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) is a main means to an end through developing highly efficient sensitizers. In the past few years, great attention has been paid to the development of p-DSCs, including semiconductor electrodes,4 electrolytes5 and sensitizers.6 In spite of high Jsc values up to 21 mA cm−2 achieved in n-DSCs,7 the photocurrent obtainable from a p-type-DSC is much lower, partly due to the lack of a rational design of sensitizers. Considering the different working mechanisms of the n-DSC, a series of sensitizers have been specifically designed and synthesized for p-DSCs.6 In 2008, Sun and co-workers first developed an electron push–pull dye (P1) featuring anchoring groups on the triphenylamine moiety. In the P1-based p-DSC, a maximum incident-photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE) of 18% was initially reported with a Jsc of 1.52 mA cm−2.8 Furthermore, a Jsc of about 2.5 mA cm−2 was achieved for P1 and P4 with optimized NiO films.9 Recently, large and heavy perylene dyes were developed, where a long oligothiophene unit was used a linker to separate a triphenylamine unit and a perylene moiety, leading to a long-lived charge-separated state.10,11 Still, it is a challenge to develop highly efficient p-DSC sensitizers which can combine structural simplicity, broad spectral response and high efficiency.
In this paper, a quinoidal thiophene based organic dye (QT-1) with a D–π–A structure was designed and synthesized for use in p-DSCs. In QT-1, quinoidal thiophene is used as a bridge to connect a triphenylamine donor and a malononitrile acceptor. The dye was designed with the following structural characteristics: (i) the incorporation of quinoidal thiophene as a π-linker into the D–π–A system can enable the construction of a rigid and planar π-system, favoring photo-induced intramolecular charge transfer and separation from the donor to the acceptor; (ii) two cyano groups attached to quinoidal thiophene by a C–C double bond can stabilize the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and lower the energy level, resulting in a relatively narrow optical band gap, which is particularly attractive for light harvesting at longer wavelengths; (iii) the quinoid sensitizer is simple in structure, and can be readily prepared using a short synthetic route.
The synthesis of QT-1 is described in Scheme 1. Dimethyl 4,4′-((4-formylphenyl)azanediyl)dibenzoate (1) was synthesized according to a previous report,12 and 2-(thiophen-2-yl)malononitrile (2) was synthesized by the Gompper coupling reaction of 2-iodothiophene with malononitrile according to the method reported by Takahashi and Tarutani.13 The compound 3 was prepared by the Knoevenagel condensation reaction of 1 and 2 in acetic anhydride. Finally, the methyl ester was hydrolyzed using hydrochloric acid to afford the target compound QT-1 (see ESI†).

The UV-vis absorption and emission spectra of QT-1 in methanol are shown in Fig. 1. The absorption spectrum has two bands with peaks at 333 and 550 nm covering the entire visible region from 300 to 750 nm. The first band comes from the donor TPA, and the second band is attributed to the π–π* electron transition and charge transfer transition from the TPA moiety to the dicyanovinyl unit.6f,14 The maximum extinction coefficient is 5.8 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 550 nm. With the dye loading on the NiO film, the absorption spectrum was slightly blue-shifted, being attributed to the deprotonation of the carboxylic group and/or the H-aggregation of the dye molecule on the semiconductor. When QT-1 is excited within the π–π* band, luminescence can be observed with a maximum at 678 nm. The large Stokes shift in methanol indicates a large structural difference between ground and excited states, suggesting the possibility of the formation of the charge-transfer state, which is preferable for hole injection from a D–π–A type dye to a NiO valence band. The optical bandgap is 1.98 eV, estimated from the intersection of the normalized absorption and emission spectra.

The electrochemistry of QT-1 was measured in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution by cyclic voltammetry (CV) as shown in Fig. 2. On the oxidation side, QT-1 shows a reversible oxidation wave at 0.66 V vs. Fc/Fc+ (1290 mV vs. NHE), which is assigned to the TPA moiety. On the reduction side, QT-1 shows a reversible wave at −1.26 V vs. Fc/Fc+ (−630 mV vs. NHE), corresponding to one-electron reduction of the dicyanomethylene unit. The energy levels of both the LUMO and HOMO are inward-shifted about 200 mV respectively in comparison with the thiophene-bridged dye reported previously,14 resulting in a relatively lower bandgap of 1.92 eV, which is in reasonable agreement with the optical band gap calculated above. The energy diagram of the p-type DSC is shown in Fig. 3. The HOMO level (1.29 eV) of QT-1 is well below the energy level (0.54 eV) of the top of the valence band,9 and the LUMO level (−0.63 eV) is above the potential of the redox I−/I3− system (0.40 eV). Thermodynamically, it is possible for hole transfer from the HOMO energy level of the dye to the valence band of NiO and electron transfer from the reduced dye molecule to the oxidized species (I−/I3−) in the electrolyte after the dye is excited by light.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations in Gaussian 03 at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level were performed for QT-1 to study its optimized structure and electron density distribution profiles of frontier molecular orbitals. As shown in Fig. 4, the HOMO is delocalized over the entire molecular skeleton with some distribution from the anchoring groups on TPA, and the LUMO level, on the other hand, is mainly localized on the quinoidal thiophene and cyano units with partial extension on the adjacent phenyl group. The results indicate that light-induced excitation on QT-1 could effectively move the electron distribution from the anchoring groups to the opposite acceptor moiety, and thus favor the interfacial electron transfer from the valence band of NiO to the anchoring groups and further to the acceptor moiety of the dye.

For the fabrication of a p-type DSC, a nanostructured NiO film is employed as the p-type-electrode for the adsorption of QT-1. The film was prepared on a FTO glass substrate by the doctor blading method according to a previous method.4b The paste was prepared using a basic aqueous solution containing NiCl2 and a polymer template. The prepared NiO electrodes (1.5 µm thick) were immersed in a 0.3 mM dye solution in ethanol overnight. The active photocathode and a Pt counter electrode were sandwiched for the p-type DSC using an I−/I3− or Co2+/Co3+ based liquid electrolyte. The I−/I3− based electrolyte (EL1) is composed of 0.68 M dimethyl imidazolium iodide, 0.03 M iodine, 0.10 M LiI, 0.05 M guanidinium thiocyanate, and 0.40 M tert-butylpyridine in the mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15, v/v). In addition, the Co2+/Co3+ based liquid electrolyte (EL2) was also used, which contains 0.1 M [Co(L)3](PF6)3 and 0.1 M [Co(L)2](PF6)2 in acetonitrile, where L represents 2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine.

Fig. 4a shows the J–V curves of the QT-1 sensitized p-type DSCs with the I−/I3− based electrolyte EL1 and the Co2+/Co3+ based electrolyte EL2. With EL1, the best device showed a Jsc of 8.2 mA cm−2, a Voc of 120 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.34, resulting in an overall efficiency (η) of 0.33%. The Jsc obtained is the highest value achieved for p-type DSCs, which is essential to construct highly efficient np-DSCs as mentioned above. The high Jsc is clearly ascribed to the broad light absorption of QT-1 in the visible region as shown in Fig. 1. In addition, the surface coverage of QT-1 on the NiO film was measured to be 8.5 × 10−8 mol cm−2, which is about 3 to 4 times higher than those reported with large and bulky perylene dyes.11 Thus, the small molecule QT-1 is more easy to assemble on the film with high surface coverage, which, on one hand, improves light harvesting ability and thus photocurrent, on the other hand, reduces charge recombination between the injected hole and the electrolyte. For most of the p-DSCs, the charge recombination between the injected hole and the reduced dye was reported to be very fast, causing significant loss of photocurrent. In QT-1, dicyanomethylene capped quinoidal thiophene can stabilize the LUMO energy, and would reduce charge recombination between the reduced QT-1 and the injected holes on NiO. With EL2, the best device showed a Jsc of 6.5 mA cm−2, a Voc of 226 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.34, giving an overall efficiency (η) of 0.50%. the high Voc (226 mV) is due to the relatively large difference in chemical potential between the NiO photocathode and the Co2+/Co3+ based electrolyte EL2 as compared with that (120 mV) using the I−/I3− based electrolyte EL1. Fig. 4b shows the incident photon to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum of the p-DSCs using EL1. Two peaks were observed with the values of 60% at 400 nm and 57% at 550 nm, which is among the highest reported efficiencies for p-DSCs.
In conclusion, a quinoidal thiophene unit was first employed as a π-conjugated linker in a push–pull dye QT-1 used as a sensitizer for p-DSCs. The introduction of the quinoidal thiophene unit greatly enhances intramolecular charge transfer in the D–π–A system, yielding high molar absorptivity and a relatively narrow band-gap. The small molecular weight QT-1 can be readily prepared using a short synthetic route with high yield. In the QT-1 sensitized p-DSC, a high short-circuit photocurrent density of 8.2 mA cm−2 was achieved under standard AM 1.5 conditions, which is the highest value achieved for p-DSCs. Our results demonstrate that quinoid-based dyes would represent new and efficient organic semiconductor sensitizers for use in p-DSCs and other organic optoelectronic devices.
