Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were prepared by capitalizing on a TiO2 bilayer structure composed of P-25 nanoparticles and freestanding crystalline nanotube arrays as photoanodes. After being subjected to sequential TiCl4 treatment and O2 plasma exposure, the bilayer photoanode was sensitized with N719 dye. DSSCs based on a 20 μm TiO2 nanoparticle film solely and a bilayer of 13 μm TiO2 nanoparticles and 7 μm TiO2 nanotubes exhibited the highest power conversion efficiency, PCE, of 8.02% and 7.00%, respectively, compared to the devices made of different TiO2 thicknesses. On the basis of J–V parameter analysis acquired by equivalent circuit model simulation, in comparison to P-25 nanoparticles, charge transport in nanotubes was found to be facilitated due to the presence of advantageous nanotubular structures, while photocurrent was reduced owing to their small surface area, which in turn resulted in low dye loading, as well as the lack of cooperative effect of anatase and rutile phases.
As one of the major renewable energy sources, solar energy has the potential to become an essential component of future global energy production. Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)1,2 are promising photovoltaic devices for low-cost, high-efficiency solar-to-electric conversion to challenge conventional Si solar cells, which require a high-temperature and high-vacuum vapor-deposition process. The configuration of a DSSC consists of a wide band gap semiconductor with a large surface area, a dye as sensitizer, and an electrolyte. Nanostructured TiO2 with a high surface to volume ratio is one of the most widely used wide band gap semiconductors (band gap, Eg = 3.2 eV). Ruthenium-based complexes (e.g., N719 and Z907)3,4 or metal-free dyes (e.g., indoline D149)5 are typically employed as photosensitizers because of their broad range of visible light absorption and well-matched energy levels with TiO2. An ionic liquid electrolyte containing iodide and triiodide redox couple is the medium of choice due to its non-flammability, high thermal stability, low vapor pressure, and low toxicity. Acetonitrile is used to reduce the viscosity and increase the diffusion rate of iodide and triiodide ions.6 An overall power conversion efficiency, PCE, of 11.20% for a DSSC has been achieved in which N719 dye was adsorbed on a mesoporous nanocrystalline TiO2 particle film in an iodide and triiodide electrolyte dissolved in acetonitrile.3
Mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticles are commonly used in DSSCs because they offer large surface to volume ratios, which facilitate efficient dye adsorption.7 However, the photogenerated electrons have to transport through the network of randomly dispersed nanoparticles, thereby leading to increased scattering of free electrons and charge recombination at the grain boundaries and reducing charge mobility.8 Recently, one dimensional (1D) nanostructures, such as nanorods,8–11nanowires,12–15 and nanotubes,16–21 have been exploited to facilitate vectorial charge transport through the long axis of 1D structures.8,16 Notably, most of the studies were performed with anatase TiO2 nanotubes obtained by electrochemical anodization of Ti foils followed by high temperature annealing.18,20,22 One disadvantage of TiO2 nanotubes anchored on the Ti foil is the opacity of the latter that prohibits the front-side illumination of DSSCs. As a result, photons have to enter from the backside of the device (i.e., in a backside illumination mode) and pass through the electrolyte, thus experiencing an absorption loss.23 This shortcoming can be eliminated by detaching the formed TiO2 nanotubes from Ti foil and depositing them on transparent fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass to allow front-side illumination, forming a nanotube/nanoparticle structure.24
Surface treatment of TiO2 photoanodes has been proven very beneficial in increasing dye loading and promoting the interaction between dyes and the TiO2 surface.18,25 Immersing a photoanode in TiCl4 solution leads to the formation of a very thin TiO2 extra layer on the photoanode surface. Consequently, charge recombination on the surface is inhibited and the dye/TiO2 interaction is thus enhanced.9,18 Additionally, exposing a photoanode to O2 plasma saturates the TiO2 surface with hydroxyl groups, which in turn facilitates dye adsorption on the TiO2 surface.26 In our previous study,23 an impressive PCE of 7.37% was achieved with TiO2 nanotubes fabricated by anodizing high purity Ti foil after sequential TiCl4 treatment and O2 plasma exposure prior to dye loading.
Herein we report dye-sensitized TiO2 nanoparticle/nanotube bilayer solar cells and perform the equivalent circuit model simulation to analyze the results of current density–voltage (J–V) curves. Freestanding crystalline nanotube arrays were produced by a two-step potentiostatic anodization of Ti foil and readily detached from the foil and pasted onto transparent FTO glass using P-25 TiO2 nanoparticle paste. After being subjected to sequential TiCl4 treatment and O2 plasma exposure, the bilayer photoanode was sensitized with N719 dye. DSSCs based on a 20 μm TiO2 nanoparticle film solely and a bilayer of 13 μm TiO2 nanoparticles and 7 μm TiO2 nanotubes exhibited the highest power conversion efficiency, PCE, of 8.02% and 7.00%, respectively. On the basis of J–V parameter analysis acquired by equivalent circuit model simulation, in comparison to P-25 nanoparticles, charge transport in nanotubes was found to be facilitated due to the presence of advantageous nanotubular structures, while photocurrent was reduced owing to their small surface area,10 which in turn resulted in low dye loading, as well as the lack of cooperative effect of anatase and rutile phases.11,27–29
Freestanding TiO2 nanotube arrays were produced in two steps according to the work by Xu and Chen.24 First, highly ordered, vertically oriented TiO2 nanotube arrays with a high aspect ratio of length/diameter on a Ti foil were fabricated according to our previous studies.23,30–34 Briefly, Ti foil (Sigma-Aldrich, 0.25 mm thick, 99.7% purity) was cut into 2.5 × 1 cm2 pieces and degreased by ultrasonication for 30 min in a mixture of acetone, methanol and methylene chloride, followed by a thorough rinse with DI water and blow dried with N2. Electrochemical anodization of Ti was carried out in a two-electrode cell (a piece of cleaned Ti foil was attached to the anode and a piece of pure Pt foil (Sigma-Aldrich, 0.1 mm thick) was connected to the cathode) at room temperature using an EC570-90 power source (Thermo Electron Corporation) at 60 V for several hours. Ethylene glycol (Fisher Scientific) containing 2.5 wt% ammonium fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the electrolyte. After anodization, Ti foil with TiO2 nanotube arrays grown on one side of its surface was extensively washed with DI water and ethanol, then dried with N2 (the backside of Ti foil was protected with a layer of insulating resin to prevent oxidation during the anodization process). The TiO2 nanotube arrays were then annealed at 500 °C for 2 h to obtain a crystalline TiO2 nanotube film. This annealed Ti foil was anodized again in the same electrolyte at 60 V for 0.5 h. After rinsing with DI water and ethanol, the anodized Ti foil was transferred to a 5% H2O2 solution for 1 day to dissolve amorphous TiO2, thereby separating the crystalline TiO2 nanotube arrays from Ti foil,24 yielding a freestanding TiO2 nanotube film.
FTO glass (3 mm thick) was cut into 2 × 2 cm2 pieces and sonicated in acetone, methanol and isopropanol baths sequentially for 30 min. 25 nm TiO2 nanoparticles (P25, Degussa) and poly(ethylene glycol) were mixed with DI water and ethanol (DI water/ethanol = 1/1; v/v) and then stirred and sonicated overnight. A layer of TiO2 nanoparticles was deposited on the FTO glass by doctor blade coating to serve as a paste for anchoring of TiO2 nanotubes. Subsequently, the freestanding TiO2 nanotube arrays noted above were transferred onto the TiO2 nanoparticle-coated FTO glass. The resulting TiO2 nanoparticle/nanotube bilayer film on the FTO substrate was dried and annealed at 500 °C for 2 h.
Prior to dye adsorption, the TiO2 nanoparticle/nanotube bilayer film was processed with TiCl4 by immersing the film in 100 ml of 0.2 M TiCl4 aqueous solution in a beaker sealed with parafilm and kept in a 60 °C oil bath for 1 h, followed by rinsing with ethanol and annealed at 500 °C in air for 30 min. The TiCl4-treated TiO2 nanotubes were further exposed to O2 plasma at 30 W for 10 min. The annealed film was exposed to O2 plasma for 10 min, at which the best device performance was achieved according to our previous work.23
The surface-treated TiO2 nanoparticle/nanotube film was immersed in a 0.2 mM dye ethanol solution for 24 h. The dye used in the study was cis-diisothiocyanato-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II) bis(tetra-butylammonium) (N719, Solaronix). Platinum (Pt)-coated FTO glass was used as the counter electrode, prepared by placing a drop of 0.5 mM H2PtCl6 isopropanol solution on a clean FTO glass substrate and subsequently sintered at 380 °C for 30 min. The N719 dye-sensitized solar cells were sandwiched between the FTO glass (anode, i.e., a TiO2 nanoparticle/nanotube bilayer film on FTO glass) and the Pt-coated FTO glass (cathode) by applying 25 μm thick hot-melt sealing foil as the spacer (SX1170-25, Solaronix). An ionic liquid electrolyte containing 0.60 M BMIM-I, 0.03 M I2, 0.50 M TBP und 0.10 M GTC in acetonitrile/valeronitrile 85/15 (v/v) (ES-0004, purchased from io.li.tec, Germany) was injected between two electrodes driven by capillary force through holes on the hot-melt sealing foil.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging was performed with a JEOL Model LV 5800 microscope. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) was measured by a Scintag Powder X-Ray 2000. J–V curves were measured using a Keithley Model 2400 multisource meter. Sunlight was simulated by a solar simulator (SoLux Solar Simulator), with an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−1,2 calibrated with a Daystar meter. The photoactive area for solar cells was 0.1 cm2. Dye loading measurement was conducted by immersing samples in 0.2 M NaOH solution (water/ethanol = 1/1; v/v) for 15 min, and then measuring the absorption of dye solution.

Fig. 1 shows SEM images of freestanding TiO2 nanotube arrays. The average inner and outer diameters of nanotubes were 90 nm and 120 nm, respectively (Fig. 1c). As the nanotube diameter is primarily determined by the temperature of ethylene glycol electrolyte,31 the average diameter of nanotubes was kept constant in the present study due to the same temperature at which nanotubes were fabricated. By adjusting the anodization time, nanotube arrays with different thicknesses can be readily obtained at an average growth rate of 6–7 μm h−1. 7 μm and 15 μm thick nanotube films obtained after 1 h and 2 h anodization are shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. After the first anodization, these amorphous TiO2 nanotubes were annealed at 500 °C for 2 h to transform into anatase TiO2 crystals while retaining nanotubular structures.

(a) Cross-sectional view: sample was obtained after anodization for 1 h; (b) cross-sectional view: sample was obtained after anodization for 2 h; (c) top view: sample was obtained after anodization for 2 h; (d) top view: sample was obtained after anodization for 2 h and being subjected to sequential TiCl4 treatment and O2 plasma exposure. 
A three-layer structure was yielded after the second anodization, i.e., crystalline anatase TiO2 nanotubes produced by the first anodization followed by subsequent high-temperature annealing (i.e., the top layer), amorphous TiO2 nanotubes formed by the second anodization (i.e., the middle layer), and a Ti substrate covered by a layer of compact TiO2 (i.e., the bottom layer) as revealed by SEM (Fig. 2a). The crack between the top and the middle nanotube layer may arise from the cross-sectional sample preparation as the connection between these two nanotube layers was not very strong. The middle amorphous TiO2 was dissolved in the H2O2 solution, separating the top crystalline nanotubes from the bottom Ti foil (i.e., yielding freestanding TiO2 nanotubes). A 50 μm thick spacer (3 M) was used to control the thickness of a P-25 TiO2 nanoparticle layer coated on the FTO glass by the doctor blade method. The variation of the concentration of P-25 nanoparticle paste solution resulted in different thickness of nanoparticle layers. In this work, the paste concentration was fixed at 10 wt% in order to form a 6–7 μm nanoparticle layer with one layer of spacer applied, 12–14 μm with two layers of spacer, and so on. The P-25 paste also served as a paste to facilitate the anchoring of freestanding TiO2 nanotube arrays on the FTO substrate, resulting in a TiO2 nanotube/nanoparticle bilayer structure on the FTO glass (i.e., nanotube/nanoparticle/FTO) as shown in Fig. 2b. The diameter of the top nanotube layer was approximately 120 nm. The bottom was the nanoparticle layer.

Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of annealed TiO2 nanotube arrays on the Ti foil and nanoparticles on the FTO glass. The XRD pattern of annealed TiO2 nanotube arrays revealed that the crystallized TiO2 was pure anatase with no existence of rutile (Fig. 3a). Although the rutile phase is the most stable phase for TiO2 crystals, such phase transition usually occurs at temperatures higher than 600 °C. Notably, in the present study the annealing temperature was 500 °C. Therefore only the anatase phase appeared after the annealing process. On the other hand, the XRD pattern of annealed TiO2 nanoparticles showed the peaks not only for the anatase phase, but also for the rutile phase despite its peak intensity was not very strong (Fig. 3b). The rutile phase was originated from the P-25 nanoparticles, which was a mixture of anatase and rutile (anatase:rutile = 3:1, ref. 35). The rutile phase remained even after a low temperature annealing. Prior to soaking with N719 dye, the TiO2 nanotube/nanoparticle bilayer was subjected to sequential TiCl4 treatment and O2 plasma exposure. The TiCl4 treatment decorated the TiO2 nanotube with small nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 1d, leading to a significant increase in PCE.36 The same treatments were applied to the P-25 TiO2 nanoparticle film deposited on the FTO substrate. Subsequently, they served as corresponding photoanodes when assembled into DSSCs.

Table 1 shows the open circuit voltage, VOC, short circuit current, ISC, fill factor, FF, and PCE for DSSCs made of different thicknesses of nanoparticle single layer (i.e., nanoparticles solely) and nanoparticle/nanotube bilayer. Clearly, the devices based on a 20 μm TiO2 nanoparticle film solely and a bilayer of 13 μm TiO2 nanoparticles and 7 μm TiO2 nanotubes exhibited the highest power conversion efficiencies, PCEs, of 8.02% and 7.00%, respectively as compared to the devices made of other different TiO2 thicknesses. The PCEs of DSSCs assembled with a total thickness of 20 μm (i.e., PCE = 8.02% for a 20 μm thick nanoparticle layer, PCE = 7.00% for a bilayer of 13 μm thick nanoparticles and 7 μm thick nanotubes, and PCE = 6.02% for a bilayer of 6 μm thick nanoparticles and 14 μm thick nanotubes) were higher than those made of a lower total thickness of 13 μm TiO2 (i.e., PCE = 5.55% for a 13 μm thick nanoparticle layer; PCE = 5.52% for a bilayer of 6 μm thick nanoparticles and 7 μm thick nanotubes) as well as higher than those made of a higher total thickness of 26 μm TiO2 (i.e., PCE = 6.74% for a 26 μm thick nanoparticle layer, PCE = 5.14% for a bilayer of 20 μm thick nanoparticles and 6 μm thick nanotubes, and PCE = 3.69% for a bilayer of 13 μm thick nanoparticles and 13 μm thick nanotubes), suggesting that PCE was primarily governed by the total thickness of nanoparticle and nanotube layers. The light harvesting in thin layer is lower than that in thick layer due to less dye loading and the absorption length, while the electron transport resistance and recombination are larger in thick layer. Thus in the present study the optimum thickness was 20 μm. Although the nanotubular structure carried the advantage of promoting charge transport,8,16VOC, JSC and PCE decreased with longer nanotube length for photoanodes with the same total thickness, while only FF increased (Table 1). Low photocurrent generation may be responsible for the decreased device performance in nanotube solar cells.

To further understand these results, J–V parameter analysis was performed using an equivalent circuit model. The equivalent circuit of a solar cell is shown in Fig. 4. The equivalent circuit mainly considered the photoanode of a DSSC as the electrolyte and the counter electrode was the same for all the samples in the present study. According to Kirchhoff's law, the relation between the output current density and voltage can be written as: (1)where J and V are the output current density (A cm−2) and voltage (V), respectively. Jph is the photo current density (A cm−2). Rs and Rsh are series and shunt resistances (Ω cm2), respectively. J0 and n are the inverse saturation current density (A cm−2) and ideality factor of a diode D. T is the temperature; k is the Boltzmann constant, and q is the charge of electron. By fitting experimental J–V curves with eqn (1), five parameters (i.e., Jph, J0, n, Rs and Rsh) can be extracted. In order to yield more precise fitting results, an estimation of J–V parameters37 and a successive large perturbation method38 were used. The J–V curve measurement range was extended below 0 V and to negative values.37 When the voltage was near 0 V, the diode current density () was approximately 0.37 Moreover, Rs was usually much smaller than Rsh. Thus, eqn (1) can be simplified as: (2) (3)
 Fig. 4  Equivalent circuit of a solar cell. 
It is a linear relationship between J and V. Thus, an estimation of Rsh can be obtained by fitting the J–V curve near 0 V (i.e., from the slope).37 Similarly, the following four parameters can be estimated from eqn (1) as initial values for fitting according to the literature.38 Jph = JSC(4) (5) (6) Rs = 0(7)
These parameters were then fitted by a Newton-like iteration to minimize the mean square of deviation between the experimental and fitted data.38 The fitted parameter was then set to be an initial parameter for the next iteration until the difference between initial and fitted values was small enough. In the successive large perturbation method,38 the previously fitted parameter was largely disturbed and set to the initial value. The iteration continued until the difference between the previously fitted parameter and newly fitted one with disturbed initial value was small enough.38

Fig. 5 shows the experimental (symbols) and fitted (lines) J–V curves of DSSCs. Obviously, all experimental curves were well fitted. The values of fitted parameters are shown in Tables 2 and S1 (see ESI†). Under the same total TiO2 thickness, as the nanotube thickness increased, Jph decreased from 11.4 to 9.5 mA cm−2 for 13 μm thick TiO2, from 16.2 to 14.5 to 11.9 mA cm−2 for 20 μm thick TiO2, and from 12.8 to 11.0 to 7.4 mA cm−2 for 26 μm thick TiO2, respectively. Correspondingly, Rs decreased from 5.12 to 2.65 Ω cm2 for 13 μm thick TiO2, from 5.04 to 3.26 to 1.46 Ω cm2 for 20 μm thick TiO2, and from 3.38 to 2.63 to 1.85 Ω cm2 for 26 μm thick TiO2, respectively, while Rsh increased from 1590 to 2040 Ω cm2 for 13 μm thick TiO2, from 1110 to 1310 to 1890 Ω cm2 for 20 μm thick TiO2, and from 1280 to 1720 to 2860 Ω cm2 for 26 μm thick TiO2, respectively (Table 2).

The decreased Rs and increased Rsh signified that charge transport was facilitated due to the presence of nanotubes, which is in good agreement with experimental observations in the literature.8,16,39 The short and direct pathway provided by the nanotubular structures contributed to a lower resistance for charge transport in TiO2 nanotubes and a reduced chance for charge recombination with the redox couple at the TiO2/electrolyte interface.8,10,13 It is noteworthy that a decrease in Rs and an increase in Rsh were advantageous; however, a low photocurrent, Jph, in nanotube solar cells determined the overall device performance, leading to a low VOC, JSC, and PCE (Table 1). The low performance of TiO2 nanoparticle/nanotube solar cells compared to TiO2 nanoparticle solar cells can be rationalized as follows. First, the dye loading on nanotubes was less than the nanoparticle counterpart,39 which in turn led to a lower photogenerated current. Our experiments on dye loading showed that the dye adsorbed on a 7 μm thick TiO2 nanotube sample subjected to TiCl4 treatment and O2 plasma exposure was 0.08 μmol cm−2. By contrast, it was 0.10 μmol cm−2 for a TiO2 nanoparticle sample that had the same thickness and underwent the same treatments. It has been demonstrated that longer nanotubes had relatively lower dye loading resulting from less accessibility of nanotubes to dyes due to one-side open nature of nanotubes.16,23 In the present study, the porosity of nanoparticles was estimated to be 79%, while it was only 56% for nanotubes (see ESI†). Lower porosity indicated that smaller surface area is available and thus less dye adsorptions. Both less accessibility and smaller surface area resulted in lower dye loading, and thus less photocurrent for nanotubes, compared to nanoparticles. Second, as verified by the XRD measurements, TiO2 nanotubes possess pure anatase phase, while P-25 nanoparticles are a mixture of anatase and rutile (the ratio of anatase to rutile = 3:1, ref. 35). It has been shown that the charge separation efficiency in P-25 is better than single phase TiO2 due to the interfacial charge transfer between anatase and rutile in P-25 nanoparticles.11,27–29 Thus, larger photocurrent was generated in P-25 nanoparticles than that in pure anatase nanotubes. Consequently, the low photocurrent generation was disadvantageous and overpowered advantageous charge transport imposed by nanotubular structures of TiO2, thereby hindering the overall increase of PCE in TiO2 nanotube solar cells.
In summary, freestanding anatase TiO2 nanotube arrays were fabricated by a two-step electrochemical anodization. A layer of P-25 nanoparticle film coated on the FTO glass and a bilayer of P-25 nanoparticle/freestanding nanotube film deposited on the FTO glass were employed as photoanodes (i.e., P-25 nanoparticle/FTO and TiO2 nanotube/P-25 nanoparticle/FTO), respectively, and assembled into corresponding DSSCs after treating with TiCl4 solution followed by exposing to O2 plasma. An optimal total thickness of 20 μm TiO2 composed of nanoparticle and nanotube layers was found to yield the highest JSC. DSSCs based on a 20 μm TiO2 nanoparticle film solely and a bilayer of 13 μm TiO2 nanoparticles and 7 μm TiO2 nanotubes exhibited the highest power conversion efficiency, PCE, of 8.02% and 7.00%, respectively. The J–V parameter analysis acquired by equivalent circuit model simulation revealed that on one hand, nanotubular structures were advantageous and imparted better charge transport in nanotubes. However, on the other hand, the photocurrent generation was reduced owing to the less accessibility of nanotubes to dyes due to the one-side open nature of nanotubes and their small surface area, which in turn resulted in lower dye loading, as well as the lack of cooperative effect of anatase and rutile phases as in P-25 nanoparticles. Although the PCE of dye-sensitized TiO2 nanoparticle/nanotube bilayer solar cells did not exceed the TiO2 nanoparticle counterpart (same results may be expected for solar cells with a reversed order of nanotube/nanoparticle bilayer structure), the advantage and disadvantage of the nanoparticle/nanotube structure were thoroughly elaborated. The nanotubes facilitate the charge transport and inhibit the recombination, leading to the possibility of higher performance of DSSCs. Future work focusing on increasing the surface area of nanotubes and dye loading to improve PCE is currently underway.
