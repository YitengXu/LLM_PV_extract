    , Accepted 12th April 2016First published on 13th April 2016AbstractZnTe, a non-toxic low band gap semiconductor, has a direct band gap of 2.26 eV, and can be a promising candidate for non-toxic semiconductor sensitized solar cells (SSSCs). Herein, we report a simple and low-cost solution-processing approach to synthesize ZnTe nanocrystals by using dendrite-like ZnO nanorods as templates via an in situ method for application in solar cells. Structural and morphological analyses and systematic optical property investigations evidenced the successful synthesis of ZnTe nanocrystals and ZnO/ZnTe heterostructures. The measured band alignment of the heterostructures directly points to the strong effect of strain and the possibility to engineer the band offset at the ZnO/ZnTe interface. As ZnO and ZnTe exhibit a type-II energy level alignment, both significant absorption and efficient charge transfer are enabled between the two. Finally, solar cells based on the ZnO/ZnTe heterostructure were fabricated and a short-circuit photocurrent density of over 5 mA cm−2 was achieved, benefiting from the preeminent absorption, high charge separation and transfer efficiency. A ZnS passivation layer dramatically improved the performance of the solar cells reaching a short-circuit photocurrent density of over 10 mA cm−2, along with an increase in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 0.46% to 1.7%. Potential pathways towards further increasing this figure are discussed.
Introduction
Due to the growing concern of global warming and the increasing demand for clean energy, there is an urgent need to develop low-cost photovoltaic devices that can achieve a high power conversion efficiency (PCE). Along with the more mature technology of dye-sensitized solar cells and the emerging organolead halide perovskite cells, semiconductor sensitized solar cells (SSSCs) have become one of the most promising candidates for the next generation of solar cells. The efficiency of SSSCs has improved tremendously in recent years, reaching up to about 9%.1 However, the commonly used semiconductors (PbS,2 CdS,2,3 CdSe4 and CdTe,5 as well as the best performing perovskite materials) contain toxic heavy metals – mostly lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd). These may limit commercial applications, particularly for portable devices. Thus, there has been an ongoing effort towards the development of SSSCs based on more environmentally friendly semiconductors.
ZnTe, with a direct band gap of 2.26 eV, is a non-toxic low band gap semiconductor which should be a promising candidate for non-toxic SSSCs. However, ZnTe is not usually applied as a sensitizer or an absorber material. Rather, it is used as a p-type doped window material6 or a top layer over p-CdTe for achieving low contact resistance in CdS/CdTe photovoltaic heterojunctions,7,8 switching devices and infrared and X-ray detectors.9,10 With oxygen doping, it has also been used in intermediate band solar cells.11 Only a handful of studies report on the use of zinc chalcogenides as the basis of solar light harvesting cell systems. Tanaka et al. constructed a homojunction ZnTe solar cell by combining n-type ZnTe and p-type ZnTe and achieved a high open circuit voltage of up to ∼1 V.12 Wang et al. showed a clear photovoltaic response based on the ZnO/ZnSe/ZnTe heterojunction system.13 Parikh et al. used ZnO/ZnTe as an interconnect for II–VI tandem solar cells.14 More recently, Chang et al. fabricated well-aligned ZnO/ZnTe core–shell nanowires by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and applied the core–shell nanowires to a photovoltaic device.15,16 Moreover, the work by Schrier et al. showed that ZnO/zinc chalcogenide heterostructures are potential candidates for photovoltaic applications, and it is possible to modify the band alignment between the materials by strain, which may depend on the growth method.17 In all these reports, however, current densities were below 3 mA cm−2, reflecting a very low collection efficiency of excited carriers.
Herein, we report a simple and low-cost approach for synthesizing ZnTe nanocrystals by using dendrite-like ZnO nanorods as templates via an in situ method. It should be noted that the ZnO/ZnTe heterostructure has previously only been fabricated using the CVD method,15,16 which is a much more complex and costly method. Structural and morphological analyses and systematic optical property investigations of the as-synthesized samples were first performed in detail as evidence of the successful synthesis of ZnTe nanocrystals and the ZnO/ZnTe heterostructure. A study of the energy band structure was performed to directly characterize the effect of strain on the band alignment at the ZnO/ZnTe interface. Furthermore, SSSCs based on the ZnO/ZnTe heterostructure were fabricated and optimized by adding a ZnS passivation layer leading to significantly enhanced performance. The origins of this improvement were investigated in depth by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and steady-state photoluminescence (PL).
Results and discussion
The formation of the as-synthesized products is confirmed by the XRD results in terms of the crystal structure. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of ZnO/ZnTe dendrite-like heterostructures on FTO glass, ZnO nanorods on FTO glass and FTO-coated glass substrates. Compared to JPCDS PDF#15-0746, the diffraction peaks at around 25.3°, 41.8° and 49.5° are attributed to the diffraction from the (1 1 1), (2 2 0) and (3 1 1) planes of ZnTe, respectively. It is noted that all the peaks for ZnTe and ZnO are accurately indexed using the standard diffraction pattern (JPCDS PDF#15-0746, a = 6.103 Å) to a cubic structure and pattern (PDF# 36-1451, a, b = 3.25 Å and c = 5.207 Å) and a wurtzite-hexagonal crystal structure, respectively. Notably, the narrow and sharp XRD patterns indicate the formation of a ZnO/ZnTe heterostructure since all the peaks from cubic ZnTe and hexagonal ZnO with a highly crystalline nature are present. Moreover, the product of ZnO/ZnTe purely consists of ZnTe and/or ZnO only, as no extra peaks can be observed corresponding to impurities, such as elemental tellurium and/or zinc. Notably, the growth of ZnTe nanocrystals affects two crystal planes in the XRD patterns of ZnO nanorods, which are encircled with a dotted line. The peak intensity ratio between the (1 0 0) and (0 0 2) crystal planes for the ZnO/ZnTe heterostructure increases compared with that of ZnO nanorods. This is possibly due to the presence of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in the solution as a byproduct due to the oxidation of the counterions in the Te precursor solution. NaOH may act as a capping agent on the (0 0 2) crystal plane of ZnO, or alternatively facilitate the dissolution of ZnO along the (0 0 2) plane.18

The SEM images of the as-prepared ZnO nanorods and ZnO/ZnTe are shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b), exhibiting the formation of dendrite-like ZnO and ZnO/ZnTe nanostructures with diameters of 50–200 nm and lengths of several micrometers. As can be seen in the SEM image of Fig. 2(b) and the HRTEM of Fig. 2(d) and (e), ZnTe is formed as small spherical particles which are relatively uniformly distributed on the ZnO nanorods. The formation of a ZnO/ZnTe heterostructure can be further confirmed by TEM images. Fig. 2(c)–(e) show the TEM images of ZnO/ZnTe heterostructures and ZnTe nanoparticles. The characteristic radius of ZnTe nanoparticles is approximately 5 nm, which is near the exciton Bohr radius of ZnTe (6.2 nm),19 revealing the formation of ZnTe quantum dots (QDs) with large diameters. The fringe spacing of 0.354 nm and 0.217 nm in Fig. 2(e) matches well the interplanar spacing of (1 1 1) and (2 2 0) planes of ZnTe, respectively. The sample was further characterized by elemental energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping (Fig. 2(f)–(h)). Brighter regions indicate higher element contents. The EDS results confirm that ZnTe nanocrystals are homogeneously cover the ZnO nanorods. This core–shell shape can also be confirmed by the results of line-scanning elemental profiles. Line-scanning elemental profiles across a ZnO/ZnTe core/shell nanorod (red line in Fig. 2(c)) are shown in Fig. 2(j). The profile of Te shows two peaks, on the right- and left-hand sides, with lower intensity in the center, whereas the profiles of both Zn and O show a broad peak at the center.

The performance of nanocrystals used for sensitized solar cells is strongly dependent on the alignment of energy levels between the sensitizer and the electrode material. As discussed previously in the Introduction, the band alignment between ZnO and ZnTe can be modified by strain and this effect may depend on the growth method. Here, XPS and UV/Vis/NIR measurements were executed to study the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) positions of ZnTe nanocrystals alone and within the ZnO/ZnTe heterostructure. Fig. 3(a) displays the XPS spectra of the ZnO film, ZnTe nanocrystals alone and the ZnO/ZnTe heterostructure. Detailed atomic percentages of Zn, Te, O elements are presented in Table S1 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 3(a), ZnTe and ZnO/ZnTe exhibit characteristic peaks at 586.8 eV, 575.4 eV, 1021.1 eV and 1044.4 eV, attributed to the 3d3/2, 3d5/2 binding energies for Te2−, Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2, respectively. It is noted that the intensity of characteristic peaks for O 1s and Zn 2p is lower in the ZnO/ZnTe heterostructure and the characteristic peak for O 1s almost completely disappears in ZnTe films as compared to the bare ZnO film, indicating that the vast majority of the ZnO nanorods were etched away. This could also be further confirmed by XRD (Fig. S1, ESI†). Fig. 3(b)–(d) show the valence spectra of ZnO nanorods, ZnTe nanocrystals alone and the top of the ZnO/ZnTe heterostructure. The work function for the XPS instrument used in this work is 4.75 eV. Thus, the VB maximum for ZnO, ZnTe and ZnO/ZnTe is estimated to be −7.51 eV, −6.08 eV and −5.20 eV relative to vacuum, respectively.24 These results serve as evidence for a significant change in the band positions between ZnTe nanocrystals alone and the ZnO/ZnTe heterostructure, which is ascribed to the effect of strain.17

To determine the band gap energy (Eg) of the as-synthesized ZnTe nanocrystals, the optical absorption properties were studied (Fig. S2, ESI†). The value of the optical band gap for the ZnO/ZnTe heterostructure was obtained using the equation for the near-edge absorption and the extrapolation of the linear region of the plot of (αhν)2 against photon energy (hν)28 as shown in Fig. 4. This procedure yields three band gaps of about 3.31 eV, 2.27 eV and 1.00 eV. It is natural to associate the Eg values of 3.31 eV and 2.27 eV with the ZnO nanorods and ZnTe nanocrystals, respectively. Accordingly, the CB minimum of ZnO nanorods, ZnTe nanocrystals alone and ZnTe nanocrystals in the ZnO/ZnTe heterostructure is −4.20 eV, −3.78 eV, −2.93 eV, respectively. Based on the above analysis, the alignment of energy levels for the ZnO/ZnTe heterostructure can be drawn as shown in Fig. 5. After the formation of the ZnO/ZnTe heterostructure, the band alignment between ZnO and ZnTe was modified significantly. In addition, the observed absorption edge at ∼1.00 eV for ZnO/ZnTe agrees very well with the calculated energy level difference between the VB of ZnTe and the CB of ZnO. This absorption edge is thus attributed to the carrierstype-II spatially indirect transition from the VB of ZnTe to the CB of ZnO at the ZnO/ZnTe interface. Notably, similar results have been reported in the TiO2–(MoO3) system.20 This type of type-II band alignment and the observation of the spatially indirect transition in the absorption measurement strongly support our claim of the formation of a heterostructure with strong chemical interaction between ZnTe and ZnO.

The as-shown alignment of energy levels for the ZnO/ZnTe heterostructure (Fig. 5) can be further confirmed by PL measurements. The steady-state PL spectra of ZnO nanorods, ZnTe nanocrystals alone, and the ZnO/ZnTe heterostructure are shown in Fig. 6. Two emitting bands, including a narrow ultraviolet emission peak at 384 nm along with an intense and broad red emission centered at ∼640 nm, have been observed in ZnO nanorods (Fig. 6). It is reported that the ultraviolet emission originates from the recombination of free excitons in the near-band-edge of the wide band gap ZnO, while the broad visible luminescence is commonly attributed to the radiative recombination of a delocalized electron close to the conduction band with a deeply trapped hole in the single negatively charged interstitial oxygen ion Oi− center inside the grain.21–24 The PL spectrum of ZnTe exhibits only a broad weak peak centered at about 640 nm, near the reported PL characteristics in bulk ZnTe.25,26 The synthesis of ZnTe nanocrystals on ZnO nanorods clearly brought about quenching of the ZnO PL at both the ultraviolet and visible emission, as compared to that of pure remaining ZnO nanorods and the numerical sum of remaining ZnO with ZnTe. This phenomenon is attributed to the type II energy level alignment between ZnO and ZnTe (Fig. 5), leading to photogenerated hole transfer from the VB of ZnO to that of ZnTe and thus high charge separation efficiency in the ZnO/ZnTe heterostructure. Moreover, it is noted that the ultraviolet emission of ZnO/ZnTe shifted to 377 nm from 384 nm. This blueshift is attributed to the passivation of near-band edge surface traps. Notably, a similar change in the band edge PL characteristics (i.e. PL associated with the presence of shallow traps and their passivation) was recently observed in perovskite materials.27 This indicates that the growth of ZnTe is also beneficial for the passivation of trap states in ZnO. The results shown above indicate that the ZnO/ZnTe heterostructure promotes the separation of photoexcited free hole and electron pairs toward the electrolyte and FTO glass, respectively, which should make it a promising candidate for SSSCs based on this structure.
 Fig. 6  Steady-state PL spectra of ZnO nanorods, ZnTe nanocrystals, and the ZnO/ZnTe heterostructure. An excitation wavelength of 300 nm was employed to detect the PL properties from 350 nm to 460 nm, and 404 nm was used to detect the PL properties from 460 nm to 790 nm. When measuring the approximate PL intensity of remaining ZnO nanorods, the thickness of a ZnTe layer was considered as ∼50 nm (shown in Fig. 2(c)). 
To confirm the above prediction, SSSCs based on ZnO/ZnTe were fabricated to evaluate their photovoltaic performances. Considering that ZnO/ZnTe would be easily corroded in the solar cell system owing to solar light illumination or interaction with the electrolyte,28–30 ZnS, a wide bandgap semiconducting material commonly used for passivation of semiconductors, was deposited on the ZnO/ZnTe heterostructure via a facile successive ion layer absorption and reaction (SILAR) approach.31Fig. 7 shows a schematic diagram of a cell (Fig. 7(b)) and the photocurrent density–photovoltage curves (J–V curves) based on ZnO/ZnTe photoanodes with and without a ZnS passivation layer, for which detailed parameters including the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and power conversation efficiency (η) are summarized in Table 1. It is worth mentioning that the Jsc of the bare ZnO/ZnTe based solar cell is already much higher than that obtained in previous reports, though with lower Voc and FF, attributed to high charge separation efficiency created by the ZnTe–ZnO p–n junction. Clearly, the ZnS protection layer markedly enhanced the initial performance of the ZnO/ZnTe based solar cell in all photovoltaic parameters (Jsc, Voc, FF and η). In particular, the Jsc increased from 5.46 mA cm−2 to 10.12 mA cm−2, an approximately 2-fold increase compared to the bare ZnO/ZnTe heterostructure without a ZnS passivation layer. This result correspondingly optimized the solar cell efficiency from 0.46% to 1.7%. In addition, the IPCE values (Fig. S3, ESI†) were in good agreement with the trend of Jsc values. The improvement of the solar cell by passivation of a ZnS layer indicates that the ZnO/ZnTe cell retains its activity even when passivated with a ZnS layer, and most importantly, ZnS plays an important role in the passivation and protection of both ZnTe and ZnO, which is consistent with and can be evidenced by the analysis of EIS and PL spectra below.

To further analyze the underlying mechanism of how the ZnS passivation layer influenced the cell performance, EIS, which is a well-known technique to study the charge-transfer processes, was employed. Here, the Nyquist spectra are plotted in Fig. 8, which generally consist of three components corresponding to the charge transfer at the interface of the Pt|electrolyte (leftmost) and the TiO2|electrolyte (middle), as well as diffusion of I3− in the electrolyte (rightmost), respectively.32,33 On account of the fact that the rightmost one often overlaps with the mid-frequency peak, two semicircles were observed in the frequency range from 105 Hz to 0.1 Hz in our present study. As can be clearly seen from Fig. 8, the leftmost semicircles for two kinds of solar cells are almost the same, indicating similar charge transfer processes at the Pt|electrolyte interface, due to the same Pt counter electrodes. Furthermore, there existed a distinct difference between the semicircles in the middle, which contained the information about charge transfer processes in the photoanodes we focused on. The recombination resistance (Rct) of the solar cells could be estimated by the diameter of the second semicircle in the intermediate frequencies, thus the cell based on ZnO/ZnTe with a ZnS protection layer possessed a larger Rct, revealing a smaller recombination than the bare ZnO/ZnTe based one. The reason should be similar to many previously reported studies,28–30,34 on one hand, the ZnS layer protected both ZnTe QDs and ZnO from direct contact with the iodide electrolyte and being corroded by it. On the other hand, ZnS strongly suppressed the undesired direct recombination channels from both ZnO and ZnTe QDs to the electrolyte. Another effect of ZnS is that, as a commonly used passivation material, ZnS passivates surface states of ZnO and ZnTe, which results in inhibited non-radiative recombination in ZnO and ZnTe themselves. This could be confirmed by the PL measurements below.

Fig. 9 shows the steady-state PL spectra of ZnO/ZnTe and ZnO/ZnTe/ZnS photoelectrodes. Deposition of ZnS increased the PL intensity of the ZnO/ZnTe heterostructure at peaks of ∼640 nm and ∼377 nm, corresponding to enhanced luminescence quantum yields compared to ZnO/ZnTe. This result revealed that ZnS deposition acted as an effective passivation layer for both ZnO and ZnTe, and reduced the number of surface dangling bonds which always serve as trap states for charge carriers.35 In addition, the ZnS shell physically protected the active ZnO/ZnTe from the surrounding medium, thus the sensitivity of the emission properties towards oxygen or water molecules was reduced, and in turn, the photovoltaic performance of the ZnO/ZnTe/ZnS photoelectrode in the iodide electrolyte was improved.

Conclusion
To summarize, a simple and low-cost approach was explored to synthesize ZnTe nanocrystals by using ZnO nanorods as templates via an in situ method for application in SSSCs. The key point of the method is to utilize the large difference in solubility between ZnTe and ZnO for effective transformation. The study of the energy band structure showed that a type-II energy level alignment existed between ZnTe and ZnO which was strongly affected by strain. Even bare SSSCs based on the ZnO/ZnTe heterostructure obtained high Jsc, which was further improved by a ZnS passivation layer, resulting in a dramatic improvement of PCE to 1.7% and Jsc to 10.12 mA cm−2. Considering that the Voc and FF values are a bit low which prevents achieving high efficiency, further improvement of the photovoltaic performance of this device might be expected by going to a somewhat less strained configuration. This would, on the one hand increase the type-II band gap between the ZnO and the ZnTe and on the other hand may reduce the number of traps at the interface between the two materials. This study provides an evolution thread of efficiently synthesizing photovoltaic devices based on non-toxic materials, which might serve as a reference and a benchmark for the preparation and application of other non-toxic nanocrystals in sensitized cells.
Experimental
Synthesis of ZnO nanorods
ZnO nanorods were prepared by a dip-coating method.36,37 A typical experimental procedure is described as follows. A zinc acetate ethanol solution (5.0 mM) was dip-coated on a clean FTO glass and then dried under nitrogen flow. This coating step was repeated three to five times. The as-prepared film was then heated at 350 °C in air for 20 min to form a layer of ZnO seeds. ZnO nanorods were then grown by immersing the seeded substrates in an aqueous solution containing zinc nitrate hydrate (25.0 mM), hexamethylenetetramine (25.0 mM), and polyethylenimine (5.0 mM) at 90 °C for 6 h. The samples were then taken out from the solution, washed with deionized water and ethanol, and then dried in air.
Synthesis of ZnO/ZnTe core/shell heterostructures and ZnTe nanotubes
Our strategy for the synthesis of ZnTe nanocrystals is illustrated in Scheme 1. The solubility product constant, Ksp, of ZnO is much larger than that of ZnTe, which implies that the ZnO nanorods can be used as sacrificial templates to synthesize more stable ZnTe by anion exchange. This process is analogous to the Kirkendall phenomenon which has been successfully developed for nanoscale fabrication of a variety of hollow crystals.38,39
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of the growth mechanism of the ZnO/ZnTe core/shell heterostructure. 
A 16 mM Te2− source solution was first prepared by dissolving Te powder and NaBH4 in water, using a simple air-free technique, with a duct connecting the reaction flasket immersed in water. The ZnO/ZnTe core/shell heterostructure was prepared by keeping ZnO nanorods in excess Te2− solution at 50 °C for 6 h in a sealed box. ZnTe nanotubes were prepared for studying the properties of ZnTe alone by immersing the prepared ZnO/ZnTe core/shell heterostructure in an acetic acid solution for about 30 min to completely remove the inner ZnO core. The samples were then washed with deionized water, ethanol and dried in air with a hair drier, and then kept in a glove box for protection.
Device fabrication
The cells were fabricated by assembling counter electrodes with sputtering platinum (Pt) onto the FTO glass and respective ZnO/ZnTe based photoanodes with a 60 μm thick Surlyn hotmelt ring (DuPont, USA). For solar cell measurements, an electrolyte solution consisting of 0.025 M I2, 0.6 M PMII, 0.1 M GNCS and 0.5 M TBP in acetonitrile was injected.
Characterization
The structural properties of the as-prepared ZnO/ZnTe core/shell heterostructure were determined using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D8 advance, Bruker, Germany), operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. The morphology of the samples was characterized using a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM: LEO 1530, Gemini, Zeiss, Germany). High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) measurements were conducted using a JEM-2100 electron microscope (JEOL, Japan). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded on an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (ESCALAB 250Xi, Thermo Fisher SCIENTIFIC INC., USA). Reflectance and transmittance spectra of the as-prepared samples were obtained by employing a UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometer (Lambda 950, Perkin Elmer, USA). The absorbance spectrum was calculated from the reflectance and transmittance data using bare conductive glass (fluorine-doped SnO2, FTO) as a reference: %Abssample = (%T + %R)FTO − (%T + %R)sampleonFTO.40 Steady-state PL spectra were obtained using a fluorescence spectrometer (FLS920, Edinburgh Instruments, UK). Photovoltaic tests for all cells, with an active cell area of 0.4 × 0.4 cm2, were carried out under AM 1.5 100 mW cm−2 illumination generated by a solar simulator (91192, Oriel, USA) equipped with a 450 W xenon lamp (Newport 69920) and a Keithley 2400 source meter. EIS was measured using a CHI650C electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua, China) under dark with a magnitude of the modulation signal of 5 mV, ranging from 105 Hz to 0.1 Hz. Then, the spectra were fitted by Z-View software in terms of appropriate equivalent circuits.

 	Fig. 1  XRD patterns of the ZnO/ZnTe dendrite-like heterostructure on FTO glass, ZnO nanorods on FTO glass and a FTO-coated glass substrate.	 

 	Fig. 2  SEM image of ZnO nanorods (a) and ZnO/ZnTe heterostructure (b) with an ultra-high magnification image of a single branch (inset). (c) TEM image of the ZnO/ZnTe heterostructure. (d and e) TEM images for ZnTe nanoparticles distributed on ZnO nanorods, the inset of (e) shows the magnified TEM images. (f–h) O, Zn and Te elemental EDS mapping for the ZnO/ZnTe heterostructure shown in (c), respectively. (j) Line-scanning (indicated by a red line in (c)) elemental mapping displaying O, Zn, and Te spatial elemental distribution profiles across the ZnO/ZnTe core/shell nanorods.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) XPS spectra of the ZnO nanorods, ZnTe nanocrystals alone and the ZnO/ZnTe heterostructure. (b–d) XPS valence spectra and the linear interpolations of the leading edge of ZnO, ZnTe and ZnO/ZnTe, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 4  The dependence of (αhν)2 against photon energy (hν) for the ZnO/ZnTe heterostructure using linear extrapolation for the proposed direct forbidden transition.	 

 	Fig. 5  Band alignment modification upon the formation of a ZnO/ZnTe heterostructure and the corresponding charge transfer process upon illumination.	 

 	Fig. 6  Steady-state PL spectra of ZnO nanorods, ZnTe nanocrystals, and the ZnO/ZnTe heterostructure. An excitation wavelength of 300 nm was employed to detect the PL properties from 350 nm to 460 nm, and 404 nm was used to detect the PL properties from 460 nm to 790 nm. When measuring the approximate PL intensity of remaining ZnO nanorods, the thickness of a ZnTe layer was considered as ∼50 nm (shown in Fig. 2(c)).
