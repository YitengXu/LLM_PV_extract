    , Accepted 13th February 2018First published on 13th February 2018AbstractRecent success stories of perylenediimide (PDI) derivatives have stimulated tremendous interest. They are under intense investigation to replace fullerenes as the electron acceptor in organic solar cells. In priciple, the strategy of linking two PDI rings to get a PDI dimer could efficiently suppress the excessive π–π stacking tendency and avoid the large phase separation. However, almost all the reported PDI dimers are symmetric structures, asymmetric building blocks as the π-bridge are rare. Here, we used an asymmetric 6-(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[b]thiophene (T-BTh) group as the π-bridge to connect two PDI units, affording compound A101. Through annulation of A101, we further synthesized the fused PDI dimer of A102. Fused A102 shows increased effective π-conjugation and reduced twist angle between the two PDI subplanes, resulting in a favorable morphology and strong π–π stacking. As a result, A102 showed an improved power conversion efficiency of 5.65% in comparison with that of A101 (3.57%), due to the higher open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current (JSC). The higher VOC results from the higher lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of A102 and the higher JSC can be explained on the basis of better charge carrier mobilities. These results provide important information and open a new way to design novel PDI-based or other small molecular electron acceptors.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted tremendous interest due to their advantages, such as their environmental friendliness, low cost, light weight, easy processability, large area fabrication, as well as potential for flexible production.1–3 In recent years, the design of new non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) has become one of the hottest research fields related to OSCs, including small molecules4–8 and polymers.9–13 Among a variety of small molecular NFAs, there are two kinds of representative materials, one is the narrow-bandgap 2,2′-[[6,6,12,12-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-6,12-dihydro-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,8-diyl]bis[methylidyne(3-oxo-1H-indene-2,1(3H)-diylidene)]]bis[propanedinitrile] (ITIC)14 and its derivatives, and the other is the wide-bandgap perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives.15,16 Both kinds of NFAs could realize an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of beyond 10% by choosing suitable donor polymers.17–22
Historically, PDI derivatives were used as photovoltaic electron acceptors as early as in 1986,23 and then they won considerable attention because of their unique properties: (i) excellent electron-accepting ability with an electron affinity (EA) of −3.9 eV similar to fullerene acceptors,24 (ii) high electron mobility, (iii) diversity of the molecular structure, (iv) easy tunability of the electronic energy levels, (v) crystallization tendency in solid film, and (vi) durability and strong absorption spectrum. However, in early years, the strong π–π stacking tendency of the PDI ring was the main obstacle to realize a high efficiency,25,26 which comes from the large planar π-conjugated system. It prevents the formation of a sufficiently large donor–acceptor interfacial area for the exciton diffusion/separation. On the other hand, strong π–π stacking is also responsible for low solubility in common solvents. After the research of a few years, scientists have successfully reduced the aggregation tendency by adopted PDI dimer structures. Due to the large steric hindrance, PDI dimers demonstrate a twisted structure, which could efficiently avoid the excessive π–π stacking tendency and avoid the large phase separation. This strategy was extensively used in the design of PDI-based NFAs and many PDI-dimers have been reported, as shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Reported perylenediimide dimers as electron acceptors in fullerene-free organic solar cells, the PCEs and corresponding donor materials are also listed. 
On the other hand, although twisted PDI dimers could avoid large phase separation and become a successful strategy to construct promising NFAs, the large steric hindrance will also affect the planarity of the PDI ring and thus decrease the electron mobility. In order to resolve this problem, an effective way is to fuse the PDI ring with an aromatic ring, or S, Se and N atoms, which is a promising approach to increase planarity and electronic delocalization.27–32 Thus, fused-ring functionalization on PDIs could reduce reorganization energy and extend effective π-conjugation, which is beneficial for facilitating exciton diffusion and charge transport.
From Fig. 1, an interesting phenomenon could be found that all the middle linking units have a symmetric chemical structure, which should be mainly due to the easy synthesis. In fact, asymmetric units, such as thieno[3,4-b]thiophene,33 dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyran,34–36 and indenothiophene,37 have been strongly investigated to construct p-type photovoltaic polymers and could realize excellent photovoltaic performance. However, the n-type photovoltaic polymers38,39 or small molecules containing asymmetric units were rarely reported. In principle, the asymmetric unit could improve the solubility of the final material and increase the miscibility with a p-type polymer. Thus, from the fundamental and scientific perspectives, it is very necessary to explore and investigate the structure–properties relationship of PDI dimers containing an asymmetric π-bridge.
Thus, we report here an asymmetric structure of a PDI dimer by using the 6-(thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[b]thiophene (T-BTh) group as the linker, as shown in Fig. 2. T-BTh could be considered as the derivative of benzodithiophene (BDT) by molecular tailoring. The asymmetric PDI dimer is named A101, which was further fused to get the analog A102. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time an asymmetric PDI dimer and corresponding fused derivative are synthesized. The optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties were investigated in detail. Our results provide important information and open a new way to design novel PDI-based or other small molecular electron acceptors.

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis and characteristics
The targeted compounds A101 and A102 were synthesized with a responsible yield of 83% (Scheme S1, ESI†). The new compounds show good solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB), and o-dichlorobenzene (DCB), which guarantees them as suitable candidates for a solution-processible fabrication process. The chemical structures of A101 and A102 were characterized by 1H NMR and MALDI-TOF (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†). The thermal behaviors of A101 and A102 were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, in Fig. S3, ESI†). Both materials showed excellent stability with decomposition temperatures (5% weight loss) of ∼450 °C.
2.2 Molecular geometry
The spatial distributions of the frontier orbital wave functions and the first excited state electron density difference maps for A101 and A102 are given Fig. 3. These parameters were calculated using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G level. The alkyl chain on the N atom was replaced by methyl to simplify the calculations. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, the fused small molecule of A102 shows smaller twist angles than that of the unfused analog A101 along the whole backbone. The more planar and extended conjugation structure was expected to induce a high electron mobility for A102. For both A101 and A102, it is interesting that the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is mainly located on the benzo[b]thiophene-connected PDI unit, while the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is mainly located on the opposite PDI unit. The asymmetry in the location of the HOMO and LUMO suggests that the charge transfer from the benzo[b]thiophene-connected PDI unit to the other PDI unit might be able to occur, while this is not found in the symmetric bithiophene-connected PDI dimer.28 The predicted values of the LUMO/HOMO are calculated to be −3.68/−5.88 and −3.59/−6.12 eV for A101 and A102, respectively. The more planar and extended conjugation structure in fused A102 could strengthen the delocalization of frontier orbitals and weaken the intramolecular charge transfer between benzo[b]thiophene and PDI moieties. As a result, compared to the unfused PDI dimer A101, the fused analogue A102 exhibits higher LUMO values and lower HOMO values. The higher LUMO levels of A102 will afford a higher VOC, which has been proved in many kinds of NFAs, such as benzotriazole-based small molecules.40–42

2.3 Optical and electrochemical properties
The thin film UV-vis absorption spectra of A101 and A102 are recorded in Fig. 4a and the UV-vis absorption spectra in CHCl3 solution are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The according data are summarized in Table 1. The UV-Vis spectra of solutions of A101 and A102 are similar to their corresponding solid-state UV-Vis absorption spectra, both with multiple absorption peaks throughout the wavelength range of 300–600 nm. There is no significant shift between the absorption in solution and in the solid state for fused A102, as well as unfused A101, which indicates weak aggregation in the sold state. Differently, upon ring fusion, the vibronic structure of the absorption shifts to a higher energy for A102. The optical band gaps of A101 and A102 estimated from the onset of thin-film spectral absorption are 1.98 eV and 2.17 eV, respectively.

The electronic behaviors of A101 and A102 were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) with a ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) reference as an external standard,43 and the data are listed in Table 1. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of A101 obtained from the onset oxidation/reduction potentials of the cyclic voltammograms (Fig. S5, ESI†) are −5.78 eV and −3.72 eV, respectively. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of A102 are −5.84 eV and −3.65 eV, respectively. The energy gaps for A101 and A102 calculated from the CV curves are 2.06 and 2.19 eV, respectively. Compared with A101, a higher open-circuit voltage (VOC) can be anticipated in fused A102 based devices, because their higher LUMO levels enable a larger energy offset between the LUMO of the acceptor and the HOMO of the donor.
2.4 Photovoltaic properties
In order to explore the effect of an asymmetric connector between PDI dimers on the photovoltaic performance, OSC devices were fabricated using a conventional configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/Ca/Al with A101 and A102, respectively, as acceptors and PBDB-T as the donor. Here, PBDB-T was chosen as the donor polymer since it has complementary absorption and suitable energy levels (Fig. 4b) that match with these acceptors.44–46 The detailed optimization conditions are shown in Tables S1–S3 (ESI†). The optimized current density–voltage (J–V) curves are depicted in Fig. 5a and the photovoltaic performance data are listed in Table 2 for a clear comparison.

Firstly, the devices with a varying donor:acceptor (D:A) ratio from 1.5:1 to 1:2 were prepared and tested. The solar cells with a 1:1.5 blend ratio show the optimized PCEs. A102 shows the higher PCE of 4.18%, with a higher VOC of 0.96 V, a short-circuit current (JSC) of 8.75 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.56. In contrast, the unfused A101 shows an inferior efficiency of 2.23% with a lower VOC of 0.88 V and JSC of 5.41 mA cm−2, as well as a FF of 0.47. Next, we further studied the effect of solvent additive on the photovoltaic performance at this D:A ratio. When using 2% diphenyl ether (DPE) (v/v) as the solvent additive, the PCE of fused A102 was increased from 4.18% to 5.65% with a VOC of 0.96 V, a JSC of 9.66 mA cm−2, as well as a FF of 0.61. Differently, when 0.5% (v/v) 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was chosen as the solvent additive, the unfused A101 showed a dramatically improved PCE of 3.58% with a VOC of 0.85 V, a JSC of 6.56 mA cm−2, as well as a FF of 0.64. As expected, the fused A102 provides the higher VOC (0.96 V vs. 0.85 V), which can be attributed to its higher LUMO level than that of A101.
External Quantum Efficiency (EQE) is an effective way to measure how efficiently the device converts the incident light into electrical energy at a given wavelength. As shown in Fig. 5b, the EQE spectra of the PBDB-T:A102/A101 based devices are similar to the absorption spectra of the corresponding active layers (Fig. S6, ESI†), with a similar photoresponse range from 300 to 700 nm. Differently, the PBDB-T:A101-based devices show very low EQEs in the whole response range from 300 to 700 nm, while for the PBDB-T:A102 based devices, the EQE values exceed 50% in most of the absorption region and they even surpass 60% in the range of 500–700 nm. These experimental data show that more incident photons in the PBDB-T:A102 based active layer can be converted into electrons, resulting in a higher photocurrent of the PBDB-T:A102 based device. The JSC calculated by the integration of the EQE spectra of PBDB-T:A101 and PBDB-T:A102 is 6.45 and 9.62 mA cm−2, respectively, which agree well with the values obtained from the J–V measurement.
2.5 Morphological properties and charge mobilities
Film morphology plays a very important role in improving the device performance of the OSCs. To gain insight into the thin film morphology of PBDB-T:A101 and PBDB-T:A102 with or without a solvent additive, tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed. As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), the images for both PBDB-T:A101 and PBDB-T:A102 based blends without solvent additive show relatively smooth surfaces with smaller root mean square (RMS) roughness values of 1.24 and 0.734 nm, respectively. As shown in the height images (Fig. 6a and c) for PBDB-T:A101 and PBDB-T:A102 with a solvent additive, the root mean square (RMS) roughness values are increased to 1.72 and 1.44 nm, respectively. In addition, the addition of a solvent additive also has some effect on the phase separation feature. With DPE, the phase separation feature for the PBDB-T:A102 blend becomes slightly more obvious, while with DIO, the phase separation with a fibrillar structure for the PBDB-T:A101 blend is observed. A smaller RMS of A102 indicates that A102 has better miscibility with PBDB-T than A101. In addition, as shown in the phase images (Fig. 6b and d), both the blends show continuous interpenetrating networks. Differently, the more planar molecular structure of A102 results in a sizable phase separation in the PBDB-T:A102 blend film, compared to that of the PBDB-T:A101 based blend film, which is beneficial for the efficient exciton diffusion/dissociation and charge transport. All of these characteristics will contribute to the increased JSC.

To further investigate the influences of the structural order on the charge transport properties, 2D grazing-incidence X-ray scattering (GIXS) was carried out. Fig. 7a–c shows the 2D GIXS patterns of the pure PBDB-T film and blend films of PBDB-T:A101 and PBDB-T:A102, respectively. The corresponding scattering profiles in the in-plane and out-of-plane direction are also displayed in Fig. 7d and e. The PBDB-T pure film showed a strong π–π stacking (010) peak located only in the out-of-plane direction at qz ≈ 1.70 Å−1, which indicates a preferential face-on orientation of the conjugated core relative to the substrate.47 After being blended with A101 and A102, the chain packing features of the blends are similar to those of the neat PBDB-T film. Differently, the integrated intensity of the π–π peak in the out-of-plane direction for PBDB-T:A102 is larger than that of PBDB-T:A101, which indicates the more ordered orientation of the polymer with a preferential face-on stacking orientation in the blend films. This result reveals that the π–π stacking ordering of PBDB-T can be significantly suppressed by blending with A101, because of the larger twist angles of A101. Further, the introduction of inside-fused PDI can keep the effective π–π stacking ordering of PBDB-T, which is beneficial for efficient charge transport and results in the high charge mobilities.48,49

Since carrier mobility is an important factor influencing the JSC and FF, we measured the electron (μe) and hole (μh) mobility of two blend films of PBDB-T:A101 and PBDB-T:A102 using the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S8 and S9, ESI†). The hole mobility for the PBDB-T:A101 based device was calculated to be 1.05 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the electron mobility is 2.53 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. The devices of PBDB-T:A102 show higher charge mobilities, especially electron mobility (μh = 1.27 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe = 8.63 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), which can be attributed to the stronger π–π stacking and the sizable phase separation in the PBDB-T:A102 based device. These data indicate that the transport of holes and electrons in the PBDB-T/A102 based device is easy and efficient, which can effectively prevent the accumulation of charge and afford higher FF and JSC values.
3. Conclusions
We designed a novel PDI dimer of A101 by utilizing an asymmetric 6-(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[b]thiophene unit as the linker, and then through annulation of A101, we got the fused PDI dimer of A102. Compared to the unfused counterpart A101, A102 has extended effective π-conjugation, which facilitates exciton diffusion and charge transport. A fused-ring PDI dimer also shows a higher-lying LUMO energy level, affording an increased VOC. More importantly, the fused dimer of A102 with the smaller twist angle between two PDI subplanes shows stronger π–π stacking in the blend film, leading to higher hole and electron mobilities, and consequently the better PCE of 5.65%. These results demonstrate that fused PDIs bridged by asymmetric heterocycles are a novel class of promising nonfullerene acceptors. The rational design of an asymmetric bridge in PDI dimers can lead to further improvement of photovoltaic performance.
