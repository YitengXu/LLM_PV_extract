1 Introduction
Chalcopyrite photovoltaics, based on CuInxGa1−xSe2 and related alloy absorbers, are currently being manufactured to take advantage of high power conversion efficiencies1,2 achieved with low material utilization. However, concerns over indium scarcity arise. Recent models predict manufacturing limits of ∼20 GWp per year for CIGSSe manufacturing by 2020 (though this value increases somewhat by mid-century),3 while others cap production at even lower values.4 Regardless of the exact values, high materials prices and uncertainty with respect to indium make alternatives attractive.
Kesterite-based photovoltaics from Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 and related alloys have emerged as a potential replacement for the chalcopyrite absorber. Promising research has recently yielded over 11% efficiency for solution-processed kesterite devices,5 yet this is barely half the efficiency achieved for record chalcopyrite devices despite the similarities between the materials. As researchers find more and more similarities between these two materials, it is important to learn lessons from the chalcopyrite community that can be used to increase kesterite device efficiency, and identify areas where the kesterites may need unique solutions.
Kesterites and chalcopyrites are expected to exhibit closely-related characteristics due to isovalency and similarities in crystal structure. The kesterite structure is obtained by replacing every two group III atoms in the chalcopyrite with a group II and group IV atom, as shown in Fig. 1. The possibilities for arrangement of the group II and IV atoms are discussed further in the literature.6–8 In this paper, the chalcopyrite copper indium gallium sulfoselenide, i.e. CuIn1−xGax(SxSe1−x)2, will be referred to as CIGSSe, with CIGSe indicating the S-free composition, CIS the Ga- and Se-free composition, etc. Similarly, the kesterites copper zinc tin sulfoselenide, e.g. Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4, will be referred to as CZTSSe, with CZTS and CZTSe referring to the Se-free and S-free compositions, respectively.

To identify kesterite research needs, a meeting of experts in devices, materials characterization, and computational modeling of CIGSSe, CZTSSe, and related materials was held in January 2013. The general consensus of this meeting (referred to from here on as “the meeting”) is that low open-circuit voltage (Voc) in CZTSSe cells is the primary hurdle limiting this technology from performance parity with CIGSSe materials (>20% power conversion efficiency). Whereas the Voc deficit Eg/q − Voc ≈ 500 meV in good-quality CIGSSe devices (up to Voc ≈ 0.8 V with a ∼1.3 eV absorber bandgap),9 CZTSSe cells exhibit a Voc deficit of over 650 mV in even the best performing devices.5 Voc generally caps around 0.6 V even for devices using wide-bandgap (1.45 eV) kesterite films,10 though 711 mV was recently achieved using void-free, ultrathin (∼600 nm) films.11 Three key areas were identified to address this problem, as listed here in rough order of priority: (1) defect characterization and passivation, (2) phase stability and processing control, and (3) interface optimization. This paper will focus on these three topics, drawing comparisons between state-of-the-art CIGSSe and CZTSSe. Each topic will consist of both a review-type overview followed by a summary of recommendations reached at the meeting regarding future research in that topic. It should be noted that although the recommendations in this paper are drawn directly from consensus reached at the meeting and the paper itself was reviewed by meeting participants prior to publication, both the brief overview and meeting recommendations sections of each topic have been primarily compiled by the organizers and main authors, and thus may not exactly represent the opinions of each individual participant.
2 Defect characterization and passivation
The limited Voc in CZTSSe devices is likely due primarily to the activity of defects and the resulting increased reverse saturation current. This activity is evident in several types of data. For example, even CZTSSe films used in relatively high-efficiency devices exhibit low (a few ns) lifetimes.12 Not surprisingly, the reverse saturation current in these devices is ∼10−6 to 10−3 mA cm−2,13,14 orders of magnitude higher than that seen in high-quality CIGSSe. Diode quality factors for CZTSSe devices are between 1.5 and 2,5,15 indicating substantial recombination in the space charge region (SCR). By contrast, carrier lifetimes in CIGSSe often exceed 30 ns in commercial films16 and 100 ns in laboratory films,17,18 and diode quality factors under 1.15 have been reported for highest-quality cells.1,19 The result of this high film quality is a low reverse saturation current, measured in recent world record cells as low as 10−9 to 10−7 mA cm−2.1,19 This indicates relatively low recombination, and is in agreement with the high efficiencies seen in these devices. Short-circuit current collection in CZTSSe devices is on par with that achieved in CIGS devices,12 which along with the high observed reverse saturation current is consistent with losses primarily due to recombination.20
The defects responsible for Voc loss in CZTSSe devices likely include deep recombination centers in the bulk material and recombination centers at interfaces and grain boundaries. Additionally, defects can cause bandgap fluctuations due to non-uniform chemical stoichiometry or structure, as well as local potential fluctuations and consequently band structure fluctuation due to point defects. The following sections include a detailed discussion of these various defect classes, comparison with those in CIGSSe devices, and an outline of potential paths forward to improve control of bulk and interfacial defects.
2.1 Bulk defects and defect complexes
Both CIGSSe and CZTSSe have a significant number of both deep and shallow defects that can affect the device performance. Fig. 2 shows a selection of the most prevalent defects in these materials and their electronic levels within the bandgap. Many of the mid-gap defects may cause nonradiative recombination, thus significantly decreasing Voc. First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been performed to understand these issues,7,8,22–25 but new models are constantly refining the understanding of the complicated defect structures of CIGSSe and CZTSSe. For instance, earlier DFT calculations for CIGSSe films implicated the III-on-Cu antisite defect InCu2+ (or GaCu2+) as the major recombination center especially under Cu-poor equilibrium processing conditions,7,23 while recent models have shown these IIICu2+ defects as shallow donors.26 In CZTSSe, the CuSn3− and SnZn2+ antisite defects are predicted to have deep levels inside the band gap and relatively low formation energy for stoichiometric CZTS samples8,22 especially when they form defect complexes with other low energy compensating defects (e.g., SnZn2+ + 2CuZn−). As such they have been suggested as likely recombination centers.8,27 However, this has yet to be experimentally validated. It should be noted as well that it is still unclear how the predicted defect formation under equilibrium conditions relates to real-world fabrication processes which often involve nonequilibrium conditions such as growth at lower temperatures and for a shorter duration, as well as off-stoichiometry composition.5,15
 Fig. 2  Energetic levels of select defects for CISe, CGSe, CZTS, and CZTSe from DFT calculations. Exact formation energies and relative abundances (not depicted here) are highly composition dependent; for more information see ref. 7 and 8. 
Both the electronic nature of deep traps and their physical origins are still largely a matter of conjecture in CZTSSe and to a lesser extent CIGSSe. Recent deep level capacitance work has shown a response near 0.8 eV above the valence band maximum (VBM) but the physical origins of this response are unknown.28 A similar response is seen in CIGSSe films.29 Admittance and related capacitance spectroscopy techniques have been mostly successful at characterizing only the shallow acceptors in CIGSSe30–33 and CZTSSe films.13,34 That said there is a significant gap in the literature on deep traps in CZTSSe. Efforts to probe near midgap energy states and gain an accurate understanding of these near midgap trap levels will be necessary in order to better address recombination in these devices.
DFT calculations predict that many defects in both CIGSSe and CZTSSe are self-passivated, forming defect complexes.7,22 In CIGSSe for example InCu is largely passivated by VCu, forming the (2VCu + InCu) complex, especially under Cu-poor conditions.23 In CZTSSe films, (CuZn + ZnCu) is likely the dominant defect complex with a formation energy 0.21 eV per pair for a variety of compositions.22 This formation energy can be further reduced through the formation of ordered patterns, leading to phases with stannite-like symmetry.6 (CuSn + SnCu) may serve to neutralize the potential recombination center CuSn, but has high formation energy under slightly Cu-poor, equilibrium conditions.22 It is also predicted that (CuZn + SnZn) and (2CuZn + SnZn) defect clusters are prevalent in films with compositions close to stoichiometry. The partially compensated (CuZn + SnZn) is predicted to form a deep level ∼0.6 eV below the CZTS conduction band minimum (CBM), while the (2CuZn + SnZn) cluster may, in addition to the (CuZn + ZnCu) cluster, cause the effective bandgap to decrease when present in large numbers8,24 as shown in Fig. 3a. This effect may be the origin of the need for excess Zn to produce the highest efficiency devices, because the detrimental (2CuZn + SnZn) complex is significantly reduced under the Zn-rich and Cu- and Sn-poor condition.35 Other defect pairs, though not prevalent in stoichiometric samples, are expected to form in Cu-poor films. It has been posited that some of these, particularly (VCu + ZnCu), may facilitate the formation of beneficial secondary phases.25
 Fig. 3  (a) Bandgaps of CZTSSe with heavily doped defect complexes. Most of these including the prevalent (CuZn + ZnCu) have bandgaps smaller than bulk kesterite. (b) Illustration of band tail recombination due to band edge potential fluctuations, which may reduce Voc (figure from ref. 21). 
Recent data indicate a possible abundance of localized potential fluctuations within CZTSSe films.21 These potential fluctuations, illustrated in Fig. 3b, are believed to be caused by a high degree of doping compensation,36 and thus local fluctuations in the position of the Fermi level relative to the band edges. Such fluctuations have also been observed in CIGS,20,37,38 but the depth and width of these fluctuations are such that they neither significantly impede transport nor promote recombination. It is yet unknown in the kesterites whether carrier transitions between physically proximal peaks and valleys in the potential fluctuations may contribute significantly to Voc loss.
Both chalcopyrite and kesterite films easily form relatively shallow acceptors. Measured free carrier densities in CIGSSe can vary widely and typically lie between 1015 to 1016 cm−3 (though individual cells can vary by an order of magnitude or more).39,40 Free carrier densities in CZTSSe cells also vary widely though these films often exhibit slightly higher concentrations than for CIGSSe, with values above 1016 cm−3 often being reported.12,34,41 It is believed that VCu is the dominant acceptor in CIGSSe films whereas CuZn is expected to dominate in CZTSSe films. This is consistent with recent admittance spectroscopy showing a dominant acceptor 0.13–0.2 eV above the CZTSSe VBM.12,13,34 The Fermi level in CIGS is estimated to be ∼200 meV above the valence band edge for hole concentrations between 1015 to 1016 cm−3,42,43 and so the deeper position of the acceptors in CZTSSe films with similar Fermi levels may have little effect on the built-in voltage. However, the future implications of a shallow (VCu) vs. deeper (CuZn) acceptor on device performance are not fully known. It may be possible, given sufficient carrier lifetimes, to increase Voc for CIGSSe devices by increasing doping level (and thus lowering the Fermi level closer to the VBM),44 whereas similar efforts in a CZTSSe films risk Fermi-level pinning by the CuZn acceptor. However, particularly because increasing doping concentrations narrows the space charge region (SCR)45 thus increasing the chance of interfacial tunnelling, higher free carrier lifetimes must be achieved in both materials and particularly CZTSSe before these kinds of Voc gains can be pursued.
2.2 Defects at surfaces and grain boundaries
The success of a polycrystalline semiconductor in forming high-efficiency photovoltaic devices requires benign surfaces and grain boundaries (GBs). That is to say, surfaces and GBs should not contribute significantly to the recombination in the device. Devices from polycrystalline CIGSSe consistently outperform monocrystalline films, implying beneficial GBs. However the origins of this benign behaviour are still a topic of intense research, and significant work is still necessary to understand the nature of GBs in both CIGSSe and CZTSSe.
One theory that has gained prominence is that Cu-poor regions at the GBs23,46–50 and surface7,51–53 are responsible for the benign behaviour. Up to ∼50% Cu deficiency has been theoretically predicted54 and experimentally suggested by some studies55 at exposed, cation-terminated (112) boundaries of even moderately Cu-poor CIGSSe films, believed to be due to VCu stabilization of dangling bonds. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), microluminescence, and other techniques21,56 have identified the n-type CuIn3Se5 under Cu-poor conditions at grain surfaces, which can be envisioned as a highly localized concentration of the (2VCu + InCu) defect complex.7,23 This copper-poor ordered defect compound (ODC) is believed to decrease both the valence and conduction band edge energies relative to the bulk material.7,54,57 This ODC model may thus explain the observed surface potential barrier46 and reduced GB recombination. As a consequence, GBs may act as efficient conduction channels for excited electrons.50,58 Computational as well as cathodoluminescence, STM, and other empirical measurements have suggested limited hole concentrations at grain surfaces.54,59 The result of band bending via ODCs at the film surface is believed to be charge inversion and a buried homojunction that minimizes recombination at the absorber–CdS interface.53,60–62
The Cu-poor ODC theory has yet to be conclusively confirmed, however. Some recent studies show instead that compositional changes are limited to very thin (<1 nm) regions at GBs due to atomic redistribution rather than secondary phase formation, and that depending on the cleavage plane this atomic redistribution can vary greatly.63,64 These studies in fact detect Cu-rich composition within 1–2 nm of random non-twin GBs in CIGSSe63,64 though reconfirm the Cu-depletion model for twin boundaries.64 Further work is needed to clarify this and similar discrepancies in the literature.
Alternate or complimentary explanations for benign GBs have been proposed. Some calculations, for example, suggest that atomic relaxation at GBs shift deep states out of the band gap, resulting in reduced nonradiative recombination at GBs.65 This and other work further suggests that Na and O segregation to GBs repels holes via formation of a surface potential65 and that OSe and CuIII defects may passivate surface traps.66
There are some preliminary indications that surfaces and GBs might play a similar role in CZTSSe as in CIGSSe. Downward band-bending and higher current flow have been observed via scanning Kelvin-probe microscopy (SKPM) and conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM)67,68 at CZTSSe GBs, similar to in CIGSSe films. As well, redshifts in luminescence spectra have been observed at the GBs of both materials, implying a high concentration of small-scale electronic fluctuations which may be associated with VCu.21 These grain-boundary photoluminescence data show CZTSSe film properties better approximating those of CIGSSe for CZTSSe devices of higher efficiency.
It is possible that a Cu-poor-surface model may apply to CZTSSe in a similar fashion as is described for CIGSSe. The energetically favorable occurrence of (VCu + ZnCu) defect clusters is predicted to lower the valence and conduction band edge energy22 in a manner that may attract electrons and repel holes from Zn-rich, Cu-poor areas (see Fig. 3 for band offsets between CZTS and the (VCu + ZnCu) cluster). As well, while some calculations have indicated that CZTSSe films may form deep defects at grain boundaries under stoichiometric conditions,35,69 it is predicted that the dominant surface configuration under Zn-rich, Cu-poor conditions does not create defect levels.35 However, more studies are needed to determine if CZTSSe can form CIGSSe-like ODCs, or if in fact such a composition would be beneficial.
Under the Zn-rich, Cu-poor conditions associated with higher efficiencies, ZnS is the primary secondary phase formed during CZTSSe deposition. Experimental analysis has confirmed Zn(S,Se) precipitation for several deposition methods,70–74 in agreement with computational work that predicts ZnS to form under Cu-poor conditions.25 The implications of ZnS for devices are not yet well understood. ZnS exhibits an ∼1.1 eV higher CBM and ∼1.3 eV lower VBM compared to CZTSSe.75,76 Therefore despite being an n-type semiconductor ZnS may not cause effective type inversion with CZTSSe.75,76 A thick (>2 nm) interfacial layer at the front contact or buildup at the back contact may act as a high-resistivity barrier to charge transfer.75,76 That said due to this high barrier it may be possible for ZnS to provide effective hole and electron repulsion from the defect-rich GBs, but evidence of ZnS benefiting devices in this way has not yet been observed. Moreover, if present at lateral GBs this ZnS layer may also need to be sufficiently thin (∼1–2 nm) to accommodate charge tunnelling through the large (>1 eV) barrier.
Despite potential for ODC-like or otherwise benign behavior, it appears that thus far CZTS surfaces do not fully display the characteristics needed to create high-efficiency devices. When plots of Voc vs. temperature are extrapolated to 0 K, CIGSSe Voc approximates the bandgap. Under the same extrapolation, CZTSSe Voc often falls far short,77 implying an elevated level of interface recombination.78 Some studies have shown no such deficit for pure selenide films, implying a possible composition dependence of the dominant recombination pathways.79 However, more investigation is necessary to corroborate these claims. Luminescence redshifts that are believed to be associated with beneficial Cu-poor regions at the GBs, although observed, are not as prevalent in CZTSS as in CIGS.21 Moreover, DFT studies predict higher instances of midgap defects at CZTSSe surfaces compared to CIGSSe in the absence of surface modifications (such as potential ODC formation), underscoring the need for surface passivation.69 For these reasons, the short (<15 ns) minority carrier lifetimes in CZTSSe5,13,77 may be at least partially related to recombination at surfaces and GBs. It has been experimentally suggested that it is possible to form copper-poor CZTSSe surfaces via preferential etching of Cu and to some extent Sn, but thus far these studies have been unable to demonstrate interfacial type inversion as in CIGSSe.80
2.3 Meeting recommendations regarding intrinsic defects
It has become increasingly clear that high-quality films with low defect concentrations are necessary for good CIGSSe devices, and all indications point to the same being true for CZTSSe films. More characterization and modeling efforts are needed to determine what defects are present in the bulk, GBs and interfaces of CZTSSe films, to what extent complexes passivate these defects, the exact origins of benign GBs in CIGSSe films, and the consequences of a given defect on device performance. Some possible pathways forward, as described below, were identified in the meeting.
A key component will be rigorous comparison of first-principles modeling to experimental results. This will require advanced modeling studies – though formation of bulk defects under equilibrium conditions has been well described, future studies must elucidate both shallow and deep defect formation in thin films and at film interfaces, and ideally describe their formation in several non-equilibrium scenarios, which can better approximate real-world fabrication conditions. These models must then be tested through a comprehensive suite of experimental analysis techniques such as photoluminescence, drive-level capacitance profiling, electron microscopy, synchrotron X-ray spectroscopy, admittance spectroscopy, transient photocapacitance spectroscopy, and potentially new techniques that will provide further reliable information on defects. As there is little experimental evidence describing the particulars of defects in CZTSSe, development or application of techniques that are new to this materials system will be an important part of effective research.
By modifying composition and growth parameters to intentionally engineer in or out desired defects and then comparing these modifications with analytical data, it may be possible to identify and link characteristic spectroscopic signatures to a particular defect, compare structural defects to local potential fluctuations, and correlate densities of a given defect with processing techniques. Techniques of this type have been applied to some extent with CIGSSe; for example, admittance spectroscopy has been used to correlate concentrations of a defect with ∼0.3 eV activation energy with device performance and Ga concentration,81 and studies have correlated processing conditions for solution-processed CIGSSe films with defect concentration and device performance.82 However, more advanced analysis is necessary to link device performance, defect concentrations and activation energies, and physical origins of defects in both CIGSSe and CZTSSe.
Critical questions to answer during these investigations include: is CuZn necessarily the major acceptor or can VCu be promoted using nonequilibrium growth conditions? If so, will promoting VCu formation raise Voc? How do the relative concentrations and depths of shallow donors and acceptors affect the Fermi-level fluctuations seen in luminescence studies, and do these fluctuations significantly affect Voc? Are CuSn, SnZn, or other deep levels responsible for significant recombination and if so can they be avoided, e.g. using nonequilibrium growth conditions? What is responsible for the deep level at ∼0.8 eV above the VBM that is seen in transient photocapacitance studies? What is the level of compensation and to what extent do complexes passivate these films? Is this to the detriment of Voc via fluctuations in the absorber bandgap, and how large are these fluctuations? To what extent is recombination at GBs limiting minority carrier lifetime and Voc in CZTSSe devices? If so, how can one form benign GBs similar to those observed in CIGSSe, and are the current models (Cu-poor ODCs, etc.) sufficient to explain this behaviour in CIGSSe? What portion of the present Voc deficit can be attributed to interface recombination? Once the physical origins and conditions for formation of these defects are better understood, it may be possible to engineer out harmful ones while promoting beneficial donors and acceptors.
3 Phase stability and processing control
In addition to large defect densities, CZTSSe films have a very complicated phase space that makes both defect and secondary phase formation difficult to control and analyze. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM),74,83 X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES)72,83,84 as well as a variety of other techniques have been used to detect areas of secondary phases in CZTSSe, but further work is necessary. Growth of single-phase CIGSSe or CZTSSe requires tight control of chemical composition during growth, particularly the Cu/cation ratio for both materials and Zn/Sn ratio for CZTSSe. Cu-poor films of both materials (and Zn-rich CZTSSe) have thus far produced the highest-efficiency devices.10 High-quality CIGSSe devices range from ∼22–24 at.% Cu, or Cu/(In + Cu) ratios from ∼0.7 to nearly 1.85 Preliminary indications are that CZTSSe films have more stringent conditions for growth, and best-performing CZTSSe devices historically exhibit ratios of Cu/(Zn + Sn) ≈ 0.8–0.9, and Zn/Sn ≈ 1.2–1.3.10
3.1 Phase space and secondary phases
First-principles calculations elucidate the limits of the narrow phase space for single-phase kesterite formation. For stoichiometric samples, the formation energy for the kesterite must keep the host sample stable, (i.e. 2μCu + μZn + μSn + 4μS = ΔHf(Cu2ZnSnS4) = −4.21 eV), and the formation of all elementary precipitates or secondary phases unfavorable (e.g. avoiding ZnS by satisfying μZn + μS < ΔHf(ZnS) = −1.75 eV). As shown in Fig. 4, single-phase kesterite was found in a very narrow range around ∼−0.4 < μCu < 0 (or ∼−0.28 < μCu < 0 in the presence of H2),25,86,87 with low instances of secondary phases predicted for μCu = −0.2, μZn = −1.23, μSn = −0.5, and μS = ∼−0.52 eV.25 Under equilibrium conditions, high μCu compared to μZn is required for single-phase kesterite, contrary to the significantly Cu-poor, Zn-rich conditions associated with higher-efficiency devices.88 In other words, under equilibrium conditions, the significantly Cu-poor, Zn-rich conditions used for growth of record CZTSSe devices10 will likely produce secondary phases, specifically ZnS.
 Fig. 4  The calculated chemical-potential stability diagram of Cu2ZnSnS4 in a 2D Cu-rich plane (stable 3D region in inset). All values are in eV (figure from ref. 86). 
In this sense, film quality, defect formation, and secondary phase formation are coupled, and it will likely be necessary to innovate non-equilibrium processing techniques to avoid harmful phases and defects while promoting uniform Cu-poor, Zn-rich growth with likely preference for the copper vacancy.
This narrow single-phase range is further complicated by Zn and especially Sn volatility during deposition. Moderate losses are seen at temperatures as low as 400 °C.10 This is a universal problem seen during in vapor deposition15 as well as solution processing.89 Mitzi et al. have suggested annealing under ambient pressure for short durations to reduce volatility,10 while co-evaporation work by Repins et al. has used a constant overpressure of Sn.15 However, compositional control remains a major challenge for CZTSSe fabrication.
Preliminary experimental work has been done to validate the calculated equilibrium phase space. Fig. 5a shows the experimentally determined pseudoternary Cu2S–ZnS–SnS2 system, with single-phase CZTS occupying a small region in the center90 allowing only a few mol% absolute deviation of any of the constituent binaries.91,92 Experimental work has confirmed kesterite structure in Cu-poor films,93 but does not address interpretations of (2ZnCu + ZnSn) or (SnZn + 2CuZn) defect clusters, which in the highest concentration limit result in ZnS or Cu2SnS3, respectively. Work on the pseudoternary system probed several formation pathways to CZTS under 670 K anneal conditions and synthesis temperatures of up to ∼1000–1400 K,90,91 demonstrating the plethora of temperature- and composition-dependent reaction pathways as well as secondary products.
 Fig. 5  (a) Pseudoternary phase diagram showing a very small central area where CZTS forms (figure from ref. 90). (b) Any given pathway to CZTS is highly dependent on temperature and composition (figure from ref. 92). 
Several of the investigated tie lines are included in Fig. 5a. Recent solution-based crystal growth studies investigated the CZTSe–Sn pseudobinary in depth, shown in Fig. 5b, to grow single-crystal CZTSe.92 This tie line further underscores the temperature- and composition-dependence of secondary phase formation in the kesterite family. These and similar studies constitute an important step to understanding the complex phase space in which CZTSSe kesterite exists. However, both these studies take place at near-equilibrium conditions (i.e. long duration and high temperature). The next generation of studies should expand the picture of this phase space to further include lower-temperature synthesis conditions (<∼800 K) and time-dependency of phase formation (i.e. simulating a variety of realistic deposition conditions), as well as the influence of alloying CZTS with similar compounds such as CZTSe, CZGeS, etc.
3.2 Meeting recommendations regarding phase stability and control
High quality films will require firm understanding of the CZTSSe phase space and particularly the pseudobinary phase diagrams. Careful empirical examination of several pseudobinary phase diagrams will help establish what compounds are formed on a given path to the empirically established optimal Cu-poor, Zn-rich kesterite from constituents. Recent work used careful analysis of the CZTSe–Sn pseudobinary diagram to grow single-crystal, slightly Cu-poor, Zn-rich CZTSe.92 This and similar work may help answer key questions: is it possible to form single phase films at the ideal compositions for high performance? Can the flexibility of the phase space be expanded by alloying (S/Se, Sn/Ge)? Since phase formation and defect formation are coupled, can nonequilibrium processing be used to affect the phase space while promoting shallow acceptors such as VCu and suppress deep level recombination centers such as CuSn or SnZn?
The meeting recommended both analysis of kesterite films directly, as well as through correlation of current–voltage (J–V) and biased quantum efficiency (QE) characteristics with processing conditions, to determine how secondary phases affect the devices and what balance can be achieved between defect control and secondary phase control. Combining such data with device modeling will help focus experiments and refine the models.
Simultaneously, advances in materials modeling should provide a kinetic component to next-generation phase diagrams, in order to predict phase formation under non-equilibrium conditions. As mentioned in Section 2.3, predictive ability under commonly used non-equilibrium conditions is critical to understanding real films grown via a variety of deposition methods and designing the most effective path to the final product.
In the process of probing the phase space, these investigations must also define the parameters for formation of secondary phases such as ZnS and CuxSnSy. Control of the formation and placement of these phases within the device (i.e. accumulation at back contact vs. at GBs) may illuminate ways to mimic CuIn3Se5 formation at CIGSSe GBs, which as discussed in Section 2 may assist in charge separation and collection.
4 Interface optimization
In addition to high-quality material, CZTSSe cells must have optimized window and back-contact interfaces to minimize recombination, resistive losses, and parasitic absorption.
4.1 Front interface
The highest-efficiency CIGSSe and CZTSSe devices utilize a specific band alignment at the front (CdS) interface to minimize interface recombination, in which the window layer has a slightly higher conduction band minimum than the absorber (referred to as a “spike”) and a lower valence band maximum. This so-called positive conduction-band offset (ΔEc) retains some of the electrons in the p-type absorber facilitating charge inversion and band bending near the absorber surface and blocks holes from entering the interface, and has been shown to minimize interfacial recombination.60,94 Under operating conditions, photoexcited electrons are predicted to flow through the spike via thermionic transmission95 for spikes below ∼0.5 eV.96 Experimental results corroborate this claim with highest-performing junctions exhibiting 0 to ∼0.4 eV spikes.94,96–99 Calculations show a sharp drop in Voc due to interfacial recombination in the absence of a CBM spike or with a negative ΔEc, known as a “cliff”.94–96,100
For devices with the non-ideal, cliff-type conduction band alignment, it has been shown that the energy of the valence band maximum is a key parameter in regulating the dominating interface recombination current.94,101 However, this paper focuses on identifying the path to high-efficiency (>18%) devices, which must incorporate optimum conduction band alignment and the associated lower interface recombination currents. Thus, conduction band, rather than valence band, alignment is the key issue for such devices.
Both CIGSSe and CZTSSe films may experience off-optimum band alignment as more Ga or S is introduced to increase the band gap. For CIGSSe films, increasing Ga content primarily moves the CBM upward. The valence band offset between Cu-poor CIGSe surfaces and CdS remains essentially constant at ∼−0.8 to 0.9 eV and is insensitive to Ga concentration,53,102,103 while modeling predicts anywhere from a ∼0.4 eV CBM spike at the CISe–CdS interface to a ∼−0.35 eV cliff at the CGSe–CdS interface.22,94 In this way, CdS is optimized for a CIGSSe absorber with Eg = 1.15 eV and is unsuitable for higher-Eg devices. CZTSSe films are expected to exhibit similar behavior. Some UPS and IPES data have indicated a ∼0.3 eV cliff at the Se-free CZTS–CdS interface,104 in qualitative agreement with some previous computational20 work suggesting a cliff-type interface for CZTS–CdS systems. These same experimental and computational studies also indicate a ∼0.9–1 eV valence band offset (VBO) at the CZTS–CdS interface.22,104 It should be noted that the values of these offsets are still under debate, and several groups have measured a spike CBM offset for a variety of compositions.99,105 Computational work using hybrid functionals can also be found to support the spike-like interface in CZTSSe–CdS.76 It should also be noted that kesterite has two non-equivalent (001) cation surfaces [(Cu + Sn) and (Cu + Zn), see Fig. 1]. This indicates that charge imbalance and electric field may exist in the sample. Therefore, the experimentally determined band offsets could be orientation dependent.
There has been considerable success in engineering alternative buffer layers to tailor band offsets and minimize absorption. For CIGSSe, research on alternative buffer layers, particularly zinc oxysulfides and other II–VI materials,106 has attempted to improve band matching while reducing parasitic absorption (CdS absorbs blue photons due to a narrow direct bandgap of 2.4 eV). A VBM offset with 1.13 eV CIGSSe of −1.94 eV and a CBM spike of ∼0.3 eV was achieved using Zn(O0.82S0.18) buffers,97 and NREL has recorded CIGSSe efficiencies near those achieved with a CdS window using ZnS(O,OH) buffers.107,108 ZnMgO109 and ZnSnO110 have also been demonstrated as effective buffers and can be alloyed for optimal band alignment. Similar engineering should be possible for CZTSSe devices. IBM recently demonstrated In2S3 buffers for CZTSSe cells with a favorable 0.15 eV ΔEc and −0.75 eV VBO cliff, with low parasitic absorption due to an indirect (although small, 2.1 eV) bandgap.75
4.2 Absorber–back contact interface
There is some debate over the role of secondary phase growth at the back contact, primarily involving MoSe2. In CIGSSe cells, a thin (up to 100 nm) layer of MoSe2 has been observed via SIMS depth profiling under Cu-poor growth conditions and has been shown to help provide an ohmic contact between the absorber and Mo back contact.111 World-record CIGSSe cells, consequently, exhibit low series resistance below ∼0.5 Ω cm2.1,19 It should be noted that investigations have been done on a variety of alternative back contact metals, with similar or worse results as those for Mo.112
Requirements on the absorber–Mo back interface may be more involved in CZTSSe than in CIGSSe devices. World-record CZTSSe cells exhibit low series resistance in the range of 0.4–0.6 Ω cm2.5 Thus, earlier concerns that Mo might always form a blocking contact with the absorber77 have been relieved. However, the back contact may play a role in film growth and the resulting bulk properties, including the formation of interfacial voids74 or potentially resistive secondary phases113 in addition to MoSe2 (ref. 114) via reactions at the back contact during annealing. Thick MoSe2 layers (>100 nm for MoSx/>1000 nm for MoSex) have been observed in CZTS and CZTSe devices,74,77,114 and have been observed in the latter case to affect both device resistance and Voc.114 A TiN diffusion barrier was shown to limit MoSe2 growth to ∼200 nm under normal processing conditions and significantly improve lifetime and device performance.114 Several studies have observed secondary phases, such as ZnS (or ZnSe) or Cu2SnS3, at the back contact,27,74,113,115 which may have implications for device resistance, film growth, or stability. It is unclear whether elevated series resistance (>3–4 Ω cm2) observed in higher-bandgap (∼1.3 eV or higher) CZTSSe devices10,116 is related to the back contact or the bulk of the film.
4.3 Meeting recommendations regarding interface optimization
While the present CdS buffer may be adequate to address some of the most urgent absorber development needs, moving to higher bandgaps and improved light transmission will require buffer development similar to that being carried out for CIGSSe devices. According to conversation at the meeting, this engineering requires not just synthesis and analysis of new materials but also a thorough analysis of the interface itself. In addition to determining and optimizing the interfacial band offset, understanding band bending, interfacial defect concentration, inter-diffusion and stability among other properties is necessary to maximize depletion and minimize recombination. Additionally because of the high interfacial recombination seen in CZTSSe cells, some researchers at the meeting recommended incorporating an additional thin (possibly amorphous) charge-blocking layer that has been used in other metal chalcogenide photovoltaics.
The present CZTSSe–Mo back contact interface appears sufficient to supply a low contact resistance, but questions remain regarding its long term stability and role in absorber growth. These questions are coupled with the need to further understand and control harmful defects and secondary phases in the absorber.
5 Conclusions
CZTSSe is a complex material that combines the alloying flexibility of CIGSSe with an earth-abundant makeup. Several high-impact research categories were identified that are likely to accelerate CZTSSe technology from promising lab-scale experiments to the necessary 18+% efficiency demonstration. These needs are summarized briefly below, in approximate order of priority. First, the formation and impact of defects must be understood to decrease the present Voc deficit in the best CZTSSe devices. Such efforts include characterization and modeling to determine what defects are present in the bulk, surfaces, and grain boundaries of CZTSSe films, to what extent these defects are passivated by forming complexes, consequences of a given defect on device performance, how to enhance favorable defects and suppress detrimental ones, and development or application of characterization techniques that are specific to the CZTSSe materials system. Second, high-quality films require a higher degree of understanding and control of the CZTSSe phase space, development of a kinetic component to next-generation phase diagram modeling and correlation of device characteristics with processing conditions and existence of secondary phases. Finally, though the present front and back interfaces to the absorber may be adequate to address some of the most urgent absorber development needs, changes will likely be needed as absorber quality improves. Moving to higher bandgaps and improved light transmission will require buffer development similar to that which has been performed recently for CIGS devices, and the role of the back contact in absorber growth needs to be better defined.
