    , Accepted 24th November 2019First published on 25th November 2019AbstractOrientation and morphology of metal-oxide nanomaterials have a major impact on their properties and applications. Here, we developed a hybrid 3D ZnO nanowall (NWL) architecture on a FTO glass substrate via a low-temperature solution process. The as grown hybrid 3D ZnO NWL architecture is a perfect single crystal with a wurtzite structure, and its orientation along the [100] direction is confirmed using transmission electron microscopy. Such an architecture has a unique combination of a high surface-area with cage-like pores, which was applied as an electron transporting material (ETM) in porphyrin-based dye-sensitized solar cells. These devices exhibited a maximum photocurrent density of 11.86 mA cm−2, a power conversion efficiency of 4.08%, which was higher than those of pristine ZnO nanowall (2.76%) and nanowire (1.92%) devices; due to their surface area and orientation. Their orientation and surface area led to a faster charge transport rate than those of the ZnO mesoporous films and the [0001] oriented ZnO nanostructure. The unique crystallographic orientation of the 3D ZnO NWL architecture opens up a novel configuration for designing high-performance optoelectronic devices and expands their application fields.
1. Introduction
A single-crystalline hybrid 3D ZnO nanostructure grabbed great attention because of its high specific surface-area, it offers a direct path for electrons, and has great potential for water splitting and optoelectronic applications.1–7 In the past, single-crystalline ZnO nanostructures were grown on metal catalyst coated substrates by the vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) method.8,9 Metal catalyst nanoparticles function as nucleation sites for growth of aligned nanostructures with a particular orientation.10 1D single-crystal nanostructure growth follows thermodynamic energy rules; in the case of ZnO, it can grow along the polar (high energy) and non-polar (low energy) plane directions.11 Hence, the ZnO nanostructure generally has a wurtzite structure, and highly preferential fastest growth along the [0001] direction.12 Meyyappan et al. developed 1D ZnO nanostructures and adopted for 3D nanowall (NWL) growth on electrically conducting substrates by the VLS process. This approach provides a highly crystalline aligned ZnO nanostructure (2D or 3D), but it required substrates, which have excellent thermal stability and can operate at a higher temperature (>600 °C) (Al2O3 (sapphire), GaAs and Si), limiting its technical viability for various applications.13,14 Afterwards, researchers attempted to grow aligned 3D ZnO NWLs by a solution-based approach on the Al2O3 substrates for use in photocatalysis applications.15 In 2013, Kim et al. developed aligned 3D ZnO NWLs on Al-coated polyethersulphone flexible substrates using a low-temperature solution approach and applied for fabricating a piezoelectric DC nanogenerator.16 For growing 3D ZnO NWLs, Al atoms are necessary, which play a main role in the formation of 3D ZnO NWLs. Here, Al undergoes reaction with growth solution of the ZnO nanostructure resulting in an Al(OH)4− complex, which in turn binds to the positively charged Zn2+ surface and partially restricts ZnO growth along the (0001) direction while promoting lateral growth along the low-energy plane direction.15 Hosono et al. prepared layers of hydroxide zinc carbonate sheets on glass substrates by a solution approach, and these hydroxide zinc carbonate sheets were converted into ZnO nanosheets (NS) by the annealing process (300 °C).17 By taking advantage of this approach, Kim et al. prepared single-crystalline vanadium-doped 3D ZnO NWLs on ITO/PET substrates through a solution technique. The ZnO NWL also was grown, akin to the nanowire (NW), along the high-energy (0001) polar plane but unfortunately growth in the [0001] direction has limited applications.18 The [100] oriented ZnO nanostructure has better electrical and optical properties as compared to the [0001] oriented nanostructure, due to the nonpolar surface and high atomic connectivity.19 The higher atomic connectivity plane can transport the electrons faster as compared to polar planes and does not react with moisture.20–22 Kai Zu and his group developed [100] oriented multichannel 1D ZnO NWs and applied them as the electron transport layers [ETLs] in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), whose performance was enhanced compared to conventional ZnO NWL arrays. [100] oriented multichannel 1D ZnO NWs have a higher surface area as compared to the [0001] oriented ZnO NW arrays.23 After that, many groups have worked on improving the surface area of ETL electrodes with growth time and hybridization (with a combination of two different morphologies) of the nanostructure.1 The hybridization and growth time improved the specific surface area, increased the dye-loading, offering a shorter path for electrons and reducing the recombination at the interface of the dye/nanostructure.2 Here, we developed a [100] oriented single-crystalline hybrid 3D ZnO NWL architecture with a combination of 3D NWLs with NWs on a transparent conductive substrate by a hydrothermal method. The 3D ZnO NWLs have large void spaces, and these gaps were functionalized with 1D ZnO NWs; without affecting the original morphology and length. The crystallinity and orientation of the ZnO nanostructure were confirmed using transmission electron microscopy. Such, oriented ZnO nanostructure offers the larger surface area, shorter path for electrons and it is more suitable as electron transport layer in optoelectronics device.
In DSSCs, dye-molecules play a crucial role in absorbing light and injection of electrons into metal-oxide nanostructures. Recently, Grätzel et al. replaced established ruthenium dyes with newly π-extended porphyrins as a sensitizer; device efficiency reached around 14% showing better durability.24 The porphyrin dye-molecules have non-planarity, high π-conjugation, broad absorption across the UV-Vis/NIR region and less aggregation as compared to the ruthenium complex. The porphyrin dye-molecules have better band alignment with redox coupled base electrolytes which allows faster dye-regeneration and reduces charge recombination at the dye/electrolyte interface. Here, we fabricated a DSSC with a combination of the [100] oriented hybrid ZnO nanostructure and porphyrin dye. The device shows high performance as compared to ruthenium complex and conventional NW/NWL based solar cells. In light of these results, we conclude that DSSCs composed of [100] oriented hybrid ZnO NWLs and porphyrin dyes are attractive options for water splitting, tandem solar cell and other optoelectronic applications.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Materials
Zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn-(O2CCH3)2(H2O)2, purity: >98%), aluminum chloride hexahydrate (AlCl3·6H2O, purity: 99%), zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, purity: 98%), hexamethylenetetramine (C6H12N4, purity: 99%), and sodium hydroxide (ACS reagent, ≥97.0%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.
2.2 3D ZnO nanowall growth
A 3D ZnO NWL architecture was grown on an Al (3%)–ZnO seed layer coated FTO glass substrate via a low-temperature hydrothermal method. Here, the Al(3%)–ZnO seed layer was deposited via spin coating at 4000 rpm for 20 s, by dissolving 0.1 M zinc acetate dihydrate and aluminium chloride hexahydrate (3 at%) in an organic polar solvent. After deposition of seed layer coated substrates dried at 100 °C/10 min, annealing was performed at 450 °C for 30 min. The Al–ZnO seed layer coated FTO substrates were loaded into the autoclave, which contains an equal molar of zinc nitrate hexahydrate/hexamethylenetetramine in DI-water and then applied reaction temperature of 95 °C for 3 h. After completion of the reaction, substrates were removed from the growth solution and washed with Di-water and annealed at 350 °C for 30 min. For the growth of hybrid 3D ZnO NWLs, the ZnO seed layer was deposited on 3D ZnO NWLs; the seed solution contains 0.1 M zinc acetate dihydrate in ethanol. These electrodes were placed in an autoclave and heated at 95 °C for 2 h. Finally, these electrodes were treated with 0.25 mM TiCl4 solution at 3 °C for 30 min, before annealing at 400 °C for 30 min.25,26
2.3 Single-crystal orientation and microstructural characterization
The surface and cross-sectional morphologies of the 1D and 3D ZnO NWL and hybrid 3D ZnO NWLs were characterized using a scanning electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 25 kV (JEOL JSM-7610F). A cross-sectional sample was prepared for characterizing the structure and crystal orientation using a transmission electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV ((Tecnai G2 F20 X-TWIN, FEI)) and the cross-sectional sample preparation is shown in Fig. S1.†
2.4 Electrical properties of ZnO nanostructures
ZnO NWs, 3D ZnO NWLs, and hybrid 3D ZnO NWLs were grown on the patterned FTO substrates and their electrical properties were investigated. Then, the as grown substrates were used for measuring the qualitative electrical properties with two-probe I–V characteristics. In comparison, the hybrid 3D ZnO NWLs show a higher current of 1.55 μA than those of the ZnO NWs (0.95 μA) and 3D ZnO NWLs (1.10 μA) due to the faster electron transport. The higher current reveals higher electrical properties and the two probe I–V characteristics are shown in Fig. S2.†
2.5 Dye-sensitized solar cell fabrication
After annealing, the electrodes are carefully patterned to areas of 0.36 cm2, immersed into 0.2 mM of the porphyrin dye-solution for 3 h and then assembled with a Pt counter electrode with the help of a surlyn polymer sheet at 110 °C. A detailed procedure of porphyrin dye synthesis and stock solution preparation of porphyrin and (0.2 mM) N719 dye has been published elsewhere.27,28 The space between the electrodes was filled with an iodide/tri-iodide (I−/I3−) redox couple electrolyte solution. After 3 h, the power conversion efficiencies of the as-fabricated DSSCs were measured in the dark and under simulated solar light conditions (Newport, 94043A). All the mentioned solar cell performance values are an average of 8 cells.
3. Results and discussion
A seed layer is essential to grow an aligned ZnO nanostructure on an arbitrary substrate and it reduces the lattice mismatch between the substrate/nanostructure. The seed layer and its effects were briefly discussed in the previous work.25 Here, we grew the ZnO nanostructure on ZnO and 3% Al–ZnO seed layer coated FTO substrates via a hydrothermal process with a growth time of 3 h at 95 °C. After completion of the reaction, the as grown nanostructure morphology was investigated using SEM. Fig. 1 shows the surface and cross-sectional micrographs of the ZnO nanostructures on ZnO seed layers (Fig. 1(a and d)), which are different from those grown on Al–ZnO seed layers because of the reaction of the Al–ZnO seed grains with amine forming Zn–Al(OH)4, which in turn binds to the positively charged Zn2+ surface and partially restricts ZnO growth along the (0001) direction and promotes lateral growth along the low-energy plane direction.23 Accordingly, we varied the percentage of Al in the seed layer and the morphology of NW arrays was transformed into the 3D ZnO NWLs;29 the thickness of the NWLs was around 20–25 nm with a length of 2 μm (Fig. 1(b and e)). The systematic morphology transformation of the nanostructure is shown in Fig. S3.† However, upon changing the morphology from the 1D to 3D ZnO NWL, the surface-area is increased. Further increasing the surface-area of the electrode, the NWLs are functionalized with NWs without disturbing their thickness and length (Fig. 1(c and f)). This hybrid morphology is well suitable for optoelectronic applications as an ETL.1 The as grown ZnO NWs on ZnO seed layers have a diameter of ca. 55 nm and a length of 2 μm. The diameter of NWs directly depends on the grain size of the seed layers and growth time12 (Fig. S4(c and d)).† These results are in good agreement with those of our previous report and other published literature (Fig. 2).23

In the solution approach, the growth and orientation of 3D ZnO NWLs highly depend on seed layers. In the growth of 3D ZnO NWLs, the hydroxyl-ions originate from the Al source of a seed layer; Al undergoes chemical reactions under alkaline conditions in the presence of amine and forms an amine–Al(OH)4− complex (eqn (1)), which in turn binds to the positively charged Zn2+ surface to grow NWLs and the remaining bare seeds used to grow NWs are observed29 (Fig. S3†). The amine–Al(OH)4− complex is like a chelating agent and would preferentially attach to the non-polar facets of ZnO to form a NWL, thereby exposing only the non-polar Zn-terminated (100) plane for epitaxial growth. It promotes the growth along the [100] direction which is effectively blocked and leads to lateral growth.23 CH3–Zn(OH)2–Al–CH3 forms spontaneously in the solution and proceeds to dehydrate into ZnO (eqn (2) and (3)). The cross-sectional schematic view reveals that at the initial stage, the amine–Al-complex is formed surrounding the ZnO seed and attracts more hydroxyl-ions. Then, isolated NWLs start to grow along the [100] direction and evolve into an NWL structure with increasing reaction time. The NWLs are extended in the direction of the non-polar surface, which is connected and form a cage-like 3D morphology as shown in Fig. 3. Al–ZnO seed layer + (CH2)6N4 + H2O → 4NH3 (g) + 6HCHO (g) + [Al(OH)4−] + amine(1) Zn2+ + 2OH− + [Al(OH)4−] + amine ↔ Zn(OH)2 (s) + amine and Al complex(2) Zn(OH)2 ↔ ZnO (s) + H2O(3)

ZnO easily grows along the c-axis plane direction, because of the c-axis plane's relatively higher surface energy than the other planes.27 The sequence alignment growth and orientation of the 3D ZnO NWLs and NWs were investigated using cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the details of sample preparation are discussed in the ESI Fig. S1† and in the Experimental section. The low-magnification, high-resolution and selected area electron diffraction patterns of the 3D ZnO NWL/Al–ZnO seed layer/FTO substrate are shown in Fig. 3. For the growth of an aligned nanostructure, the seed layer is necessary to reduce the lattice mismatch between the nanostructure/substrate. There were two directional stresses along the ZnO [0001] (polar) or [100] (non-polar) directions due to a lattice mismatch between the ZnO (0001) or (100) and the FTO (110) planes.30 The surface/strain energy of ZnO (0001) or (100) and the FTO (110) plane has a lattice mismatch of more than 25% (ref. 22 and 31) (Fig. S5†). Fig. 3(a) shows the low-magnification of NWLs grown perpendicularly to the substrate with the help of a seed layer (lattice mismatch less than 1%). These NWLs have a smooth surface with a uniform thinness of ca. 20–25 nm along their entire length. The circular region in Fig. 3(a) represents the selected area apertures used in the TEM analysis. The SAED patterns obtained for NWL (SAED1), Al–ZnO (SAED2) and FTO (SAED3) are shown in Fig. 3(b–d). The SAED patterns of the NWL/Al–ZnO seed layer reveal a single crystalline phase with a wurtzite structure as shown in Fig. 3(b and c) and FTO grains are in the polycrystalline phase with a tetragonal structure (Fig. 3(d)). The interplanar spacing of the 3D ZnO NWL/seed layer is calculated to be 0.28 nm from an HR-TEM image shown in Fig. 3(e), corresponding to the wurtzite ZnO (100) plane, thus indicating the [100] orientation.32 In this case, the [100] orientation arises because Al and amines are low-temperature active components; after keeping the Al–ZnO seeded FTO substrate in the growth solution, an Al-complex is immediately formed and started growing along the direction of the low energy plane. The low energy planes have non-polar surfaces and are stable under acidic conditions compared to those having polar surfaces. The non-polar surface has high atom to atom connectivity and fast electron transport. Therefore, [100] oriented ZnO nanostructures are well suited for optoelectronic applications. The high-magnification cross-sectional SEM and TEM images of the aligned ZnO nanostructure/seed layer are shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4(a and b) shows the interface between the NWL/seed layer, a clear boundary and no relation between the NWL thickness and grain size of the seed layer. Using a similar approach, we demonstrated the NW/seed layer relation in Fig. S4.† NWs are perpendicularly grown on seed layer grains. Here, strong evidence confirming that the ZnO NW diameter and orientation are directly influenced by the seed layer grain size is provided in Fig. 4(c and d). The average diameter of ZnO NWs and the size of the seed grains were estimated from 5 NW-seed interfaces (Fig. S4(c and d)†). The SAED patterns (Fig. S6(b–d)†) suggest that the solution grown aligned ZnO NW/seed layer has a single crystalline phase.

The scanning and transmission electron microscopy micrographs reveal that the seed layers play the major role in the transformation of the morphology from 1D NW to 3D NWLs and these 3D NWLs were functionalized with NWs without affecting the morphology and length of the nanostructure (Fig. 4(a)). By changing the morphology of the electrode, the surface area is enhanced, which was confirmed by the dye absorption using UV-Vis spectroscopy. After patterning the electrodes to an active area of 0.36 cm−2, they were separately immersed into the solution of 0.2 mM porphyrin and N719 dyes for 3 h (the digital photographs of the dye absorbed electrodes are shown in Fig. 4(b and c)).25 Then dye-molecules are desorbed from electrodes using 0.1 M NaOH in polar solvents and analysed. Compared to the 1D and 3D ZnO NWLs, hybrid 3D ZnO NWLs have more dye adsorption as shown in Fig. 4(d and e) (Tables 1 and S1†). The hybrid 3D ZnO NWLs have a higher surface area as compared with 1D and 3D ZnO nanostructures. The ZnO nanostructure electrodes have more porphyrin molecules adsorbed as compared to the N719 dye due to the porphyrin dyes.28 After desorption of dye-molecules from the electrodes, the electrode morphology was analysed using SEM (Fig. S7†). The surface of ZnO nanostructures starts to become damaged in the N719 dye because this dye has more acidic groups and the pH of the solution being approximately 4. Here, acidic groups react with ZnO and release H+ ions which affect the surface of ZnO nanostructures.26 The ZnO nanostructures are stable in the porphyrin dye due to their less acidic nature.

After confirmation of orientations and surface-areas, the ZnO nanostructures were applied as electron transport layers in dye solar cells. Before fabricating solar cells, all electrodes were treated with 0.25 mM TiCl4 solution at 3 °C for 30 min and annealed at 400 °C for 30 min. Fig. 5(a) shows the cross-sectional schematic illustration of dye-adsorption and electron transport in hybrid 3D ZnO NWLs. As compared to the previous literature, the porphyrin dye has better band alignment and redox coupling with ZnO as compared to the N719 dye. It allows faster electron injection, dye-regeneration and reduces the charge recombination at the dye/electrolyte interface. The porphyrin dye has a high π-conjugation and a non-planar structure,28 which can lead to rapid dye-regeneration, avoiding the charge recombination at the interface of dye/ZnO. After the fabrication of solar cells, the current–voltage characteristics were measured under 1 sun conditions (100 mW cm−2, air mass 1.5 G) and are shown in Fig. 5(b). The hybrid 3D ZnO NWL based porphyrin sensitized solar cells show a maximum Jsc of 11.86 mA cm−2, higher than those of NW (5.61 mA cm−2) and 3D NWL (8.25 mA cm−2) devices, but there is a slightly notable difference in Voc and the fill factor (FF). Accordingly, a maximum power conversion efficiency of 4.08% was achieved in hybrid 3D ZnO NWL solar cells and other parameters of the devices are listed in Table 1. These results are in strong agreement with the UV-Vis spectra of dye-desorption as shown in Fig. 4(d and e) and the dark-current of the 3D-ZnO NWL based solar cells is higher than those of the 3D ZnO NWL and NW (Fig. 5(c)). Furthermore, higher Jsc of hybrid 3D ZnO NWL-based porphyrin solar cells was confirmed using dark-current characteristics.27 The hybrid 3D ZnO NWL architecture acts as a light-scattering layer and allows more electrolyte infiltration as compared to the NW and NWLs. The better electrolyte penetrated devices (hybrid 3D ZnO NWL architecture) has better contact with the counter electrode; it reduces the recombination at the interface of dye/electrolyte and lower dark-current density. The dark current density is lower due to the higher potential barrier and there is no leakage current from the device; therefore, the corresponding devices exhibited higher Jsc. It is worth mentioning here that conventional N719 based DSSCs fabricated with NW, 3D NWL and hybrid 3D ZnO NWL photoanodes also exhibit a similar trend in the electrical properties, but these devices show lower performance than the porphyrin-based solar cells (Fig. S8 and Table S1†); due to the higher absorption and better band alignment. Furthermore, we have prepared solar cells using the equal amount of dye adsorbed by the electrodes and these devices also shown a similar trend in the performance to the 2 mM dye based devices. These data are shown in ESI Fig. S9† and device parameters are listed in Table S2.† In this case also, the hybrid 3D ZnO nanowall based solar cells exhibited higher performance as compared to the NW and 3D ZnO NWL based solar cells. The hybrid 3D ZnO nanowall has a higher specific surface area and a shorter path for electrons as compared to the other structures with a specific orientation. The specific orientation with large surface area electrodes is more apt for perovskite solar cells as electron transport layers and other optoelectronic applications.

4. Conclusion
In summary, we grew a [100] oriented 3D ZnO NWL architecture on a seed layer coated FTO glass substrate via the hydrothermal method, then functionalized with 1D ZnO NWs to increase the surface-area of the electrode. [100] oriented planes have a non-polar surface with more connectivity between planes and better electrical properties, which increase their stability under acidic conditions as compared to those having a polar surface. The non-polar planes slowly react with dye-molecules and form a strong ester linkage on ZnO without aggregation. [100] oriented hybrid 3D ZnO NWL architecture based solar cells show higher power conversion efficiencies than the conventional oriented ZnO nanostructures. Such an architecture and combination will be of broad academic and industrial interest, for example, for the use in light emitting diodes, photodetectors, perovskite solar cells and so on.
