    , Accepted 26th November 2020First published on 26th November 2020AbstractA novel kind of highly efficient photoanode was constructed with a SbSI/WO3 heterostructurefabricated through two hydrothermal reactions followed by an iodination reaction (WO3 → Sb2S3/WO3 → SbSI/WO3). After optimizing the solvent [carbon disulfide (CS2)] for SbI3, the SbSI(CS2)/WO3 photoanode shows high-density single-crystalline SbSI nanorods growing along the polar [001] direction on WO3 nanoplates, resulting in excellent photocurrent performance (∼2.1 mA cm−2@1.23 V vs. RHE) and an improved photostability. It is evidenced that the higher crystallinity of SbSI has a positive effect on the photostability of the constructed SbSI/WO3 photoanodes.
Antimony sulphoiodide (SbSI) is a group of classic ferroelectric semiconductor materials with a bandgap around 2.0 eV. It possesses a small effective mass of electrons and holes with high transport capability, which facilitates the migration and separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. SbSI is also the first material to be observed for the ferroelectric photovoltaic effect. Based on the excellent visible light absorption and photoelectric response ability, SbSI has been reported in a large number of applications of photo-detectors,1,2 gas detectors,3 solar cells4,5 and photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants.6,7 For instance, Nie et al. fabricated an SbSI solar cell by the reaction of Sb2S3 and SbI3 solution in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), which reached a power conversion efficiency of 3.05%.4 Choi et al. fabricated a dense SbSI thin film solar cell by the corresponding reaction between amorphous Sb2S3 and SbI3 solution, which dissolved in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) or DMF solvent, and reached a power conversion efficiency of 0.93%.5
The construction of semiconductor heterojunctions has been demonstrated as an efficient way of improving the photo-excited charge separation in solar energy conversion.8–11 Although the electron–hole separation in the polarized heterojunction SbSI/SbSBr structure for high-efficiency solar energy conversion has been proposed in theory,12 further SbSI heterostructure-related experimental research is still lacking. As a classic sulfur–iodine crystal material, the photoelectro-chemical (PEC) properties of SbSI as anodes are rarely reported, so it would also provide valuable information, including the stability under anodic and photoanodic conditions.
In this article, we report that the SbSI material serves as a light harvester to construct an SbSI/WO3 heterostructure as a highly efficient photoanode. By optimizing the solvent (carbon disulfide, CS2) for SbI3, single-crystalline SbSI nanorods grow along the [001] direction on WO3 nanoplates, resulting in excellent photocurrent performance (∼2.1 mA cm−2@1.23 V vs. RHE) and a better photostability. Furthermore, we studied the photocurrent stability of the SbSI/WO3 photoanode, whereas the photocorrosion of SbSI is a vital problem to discuss for the application in water oxidation. We found that the stability of the photocurrent depends on the choice of the electrolyte, and it shows a better stability in saturated Na2SO4.
Due to the relatively low roughness of the commercial FTO surface (Ra: 10–20 nm),13 we find that it is difficult to obtain the massive growth of SbSI nanorod materials with a diameter greater than 100 nm on the FTO substrate. Varghese et al. successfully fabricated vertically oriented ferroelectric SbSI nanorods on anodic aluminum oxide/titanium/silicon (AAO/Ti/Si) by vapor phase deposition and proposed the surface roughness of substrates is a control mechanism.14 Here we select WO3 as the substrate material for the growth of single crystalline SbSI nanorods. The as-prepared WO3 sample shows strong diffraction peaks (Fig. 1a) in the monoclinic phase (JCPDS No. 75-2072) without impurity and presents an irregular nanoplate structure consisting of nanoplates with a side length up to 2–3 μm and a thickness up to 0.3–0.4 μm, stacked on top of each other (as shown in Fig. 2a). In the next step, a hydrothermal process was performed for the Sb2S3 deposition on WO3/FTO. As shown in Fig. 2b, the spherical Sb2S3 with an average diameter of ∼0.3 μm are uniformly grown and distributed mainly on the edges of the WO3 nanoplates. Based on the deposited Sb2S3, the fabrication of SbSI follows an iodination reaction: Sb2S3 + SbI3 = 3SbSI, as mentioned in the literature.4,5 The precursor for iodination, SbI3 solution, was prepared in the selected solvent and spin-coated on Sb2S3/WO3/FTO. Inspired by the literature,5 Choi et al. emphasized that “the solvent used for the SbI3 dissolution played an important role in determining the SbSI morphology”, here we select three kinds of solvents for SbI3: NMP, DMF and CS2. By using various solvents for SbI3, very different morphologies of SbSI have been produced, which are denoted as SbSI(NMP)/WO3, SbSI(DMF)/WO3 and SbSI(CS2)/WO3, respectively. When using NMP, the morphology of SbSI shows densely aggregated nanoparticles with indistinguishable boundaries, grown on the WO3 nanoplates (Fig. 2c). The original diffraction intensity of the SbSI on FTO or WO3/FTO was very low (for clear identification, 5-factor multiplied in Fig. 1a). Nevertheless, the orthorhombic structure of the pure phase SbSI could be confirmed. In the sample of SbSI(DMF)/WO3, the SbSI morphology presents in the nanorod structure with an average length of 1.4 μm and a diameter of 0.2 μm. A considerable part of SbSI nanorods are bound together and present in the disorder directions (Fig. 2d). The diffraction peaks that belong to SbSI increased significantly. As shown in Fig. 2e, the sample of SbSI(CS2)/WO3 is composed of densely isolated SbSI single-crystalline nanorods array, with average length of 2.5 μm and diameter of 0.2 μm. The anode gives the strongest diffraction intensity of SbSI, suggesting the best crystallized SbSI. Here this is the first time, as we know, where CS2 is used as an SbI3 solvent to iodize Sb2S3 for preparing SbSI. We choose the diffraction peak (2θ = 29.8°) as an internal standard for the crystalline SbSI: the crystalline SbSI(CS2)/WO3 was enhanced about 2-fold, compared to SbSI/WO3 using DMF and NMP, as indicated by the normalized peak intensities (Fig. 1b). In addition, the chemical composition of SbSI(CS2)/WO3 was analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS, Fig. 2f), and the atomic ratio of Sb:S:I equals 1.13:1.03:1. Regarding the potential instrumental error, this value is very close to the ideal one. Note that the samples of SbSI(DMF)/WO3 and SbSI(NMP)/WO3 have similar ideal chemical compositions based on EDS analysis (data not shown). Regardless of which solvent is used for SbI3 (from Fig. 2b–e), the SbSI nanostructures (particles/nanorods) grew on the surface of the WO3 nanoplates with a distinguishable interface, which confirms that the SbSI/WO3 heterojunctions are formed in all the three kinds of SbSI/WO3 samples.

(b) The comparison of the normalized intensity (I/I0, I0 refers to SbSI(CS2)/WO3) of the diffraction peak at 29.8°, which belongs to the intensive diffraction plane (121) in the standard XRD pattern of SbSI.

The crystalline state of SbSI(CS2)/WO3 was further characterized by TEM and HRTEM (Fig. S1, ESI†), suggesting the single crystal feature of SbSI in the SbSI(CS2)/WO3 sample. As far as the method is concerned, we observed the rapid spreading of the SbI3 solution dissolved in CS2 when it was spun coat on the surface of the Sb2S3/WO3 substrate, which may be due to the extremely low boiling point (46.2 °C) of CS2, much lower than those of DMF (153 °C) and NMP (202 °C). In contrast to the viewpoint of low volatility enabling the formation of uniform nucleation and obtaining uniform and dense SbSI films,5 in our case the rapid volatilization of the solvent facilitates fabrication of the highly crystalline SbSI. More details on the solvents (NMP, DMF, and CS2) and physical and chemical effects on the crystalline SbSI and the morphology are still under investigation.
Besides providing the nucleation sites, the assembled SbSI/WO3 heterostructure shows excellent PEC performance, suggesting high electron–hole separation efficiency. Compared to the bare WO3 photoanode (Fig. 3b), the composite photoanodes offer a higher photoanodic current: SbSI(CS2)/WO3 (2.1 mA cm−2), SbSI (NMP)/WO3 (2.5 mA cm−2), and SbSI(DMF)/WO3 (1.9 mA cm−2) at 1.23 VRHE. The performance of the bare SbSI on FTO is extremely low. Based on the EIS Nyquist plots (Fig. 3c) and the fitted equivalent capacitance results (CPE, Table S2, ESI†), no matter if the results were obtained under the light or in the dark (compare the slopes in Fig. 4b), the capacitance of the photoanodes with SbSI grown on the surface of WO3 is higher than that of the bare WO3, indicating that the composite of SbSI and WO3 actually reduces the width of the depletion layers at the semiconductor–liquid interface. The integrated IPCE of SbSI(CS2)/WO3 is about 3 times that of WO3 at 0.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl, Fig. 3e), which coincides with the photocurrent results. Although SbSI-based photovoltaic cells achieved high efficiency,4 the performance in terms of the photostability of the SbSI/WO3 photoanodes was bad in 0.5 M Na2SO4 (Fig. 3d). An improved photostability of the SbSI(CS2)/WO3 photoanode was accomplished in saturated Na2SO4 solution (Fig. S10 and S11, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 3f, the SbSI(CS2)/WO3 photoanodes offer the best stability (the same result for bare SbSI/FTO, Fig, S2, ESI†), which matches well with the discussion on the crystallinity of SbSI on SbSI/WO3 photoanodes, indicating that the higher crystallinity of SbSI(CS2) has a positive influence on the photostability of the constructed SbSI/WO3 photoanodes.

The flat-band potential of SbSI and WO3 was independently measured by Mott–Schottky (M–S) analysis (Fig. 4a and b). The SbSI and WO3 materials exhibited n-type conductivity. Extrapolating the Mott–Schottky (M–S) curves to 1/C2 = 0 led to flat-band potentials (Vfb) of +0.23 VRHE for all the SbSI samples (apart from the bare FTO), regardless of the solvents used for SbI3. For the bare WO3, the flat-band potential is +0.62 VRHE (whether or not it had been calcined in nitrogen, Fig. S3, ESI†). Surprisingly, the composite SbSI with WO3 shows the same flat-band potential (+0.62 VRHE) as WO3. This value agrees well with the onset potential of the anodic photocurrent (Fig. 3b).
According to the literature,15 two mechanisms are proposed for the origin of the photovoltage in PEC systems: semiconductor–liquid junction (SCLJ) and solid–solid interface (buried junction). In our case, a photovoltage of 0.4 V was obtained from the potential difference between light and dark (Ephoto) for the same current density16 (Fig. 4c, SbSI(CS2)/WO3 in the two-electrode PEC system). The positive photovoltage value indicates that a built-in electric field was formed at the interface, which facilitates the photo-excited electron and hole separation. Considering the fact that WO3 dominated the flat-band position of SbSI/WO3 at contact with the electrolyte, we speculate that a space charge region was formed by the interface between WO3 and the electrolyte, which is the origin of photovoltage as shown in Fig. 4c (see part 4 analysis in the ESI†). And the SbSI nanorods, which are sandwiched between WO3 and the electrolyte, act as a photoactive layer: under light irradiation, the electrons and holes inside the SbSI nanorods are separated to generate an active photocurrent under the influence of the space charge region formed by WO3 and the electrolyte. The SbSI/WO3 heterostructures follow the semiconductor–liquid junction (SCLJ) mechanism for the performance as photoanodes.
The energy diagram of the SbSI(CS2)/WO3 heterostructure is depicted in Scheme 1 (part 4 in the ESI†). In this diagram, WO3 and SbSI form a type II heterostructure.17 As mentioned above, since the flat band position of WO3 dominates the entire space charge region of the semiconductor–liquid interface after the electrode is polarized, the photo-excited electrons and holes in SbSI are separated in this internal electric field. SbSI in this structure produced a significant charge separation under illumination: besides the responsive IPCE reaches 650 nm (Fig. 3e, average IPCE ∼8% in 450–650 nm), a great boost of IPCE up to 50% was induced in 300–350 nm, whereas SbSI and WO3 are simultaneously excited, confirming the effectiveness of the SbSI/WO3 heterojunction.

In almost all instances with visible light-responsive sulfides as photoanode materials, they are more or less facing the photo-corrosion problem. It is not surprising that sulphoiodide (SbSI) suffers from this issue in a PEC anodic environment (see part 5 in the ESI†). Note that a similar problem exists when exploiting hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskites for PEC applications and photocatalysis.18 This may weaken its O2 evolution capability from PEC water splitting: regarding the electrochemical water oxidation by semiconductors, the bonding of metal ion and hydroxyl is a necessary step.19 Nevertheless, a bubble was observed near the SbSI(CS2)/WO3 photoanode after a 1200 s photo-duration test when 1 M H2SO4 was used as the electrolyte, with a bias of 0.8 VAg/AgCl. Evidently for practical application, an effective layer deposition20–22 for protection of SbSI/WO3 against photocorrosion and an OER catalyst decoration for achieving high Faraday efficiency in PEC water oxidation are required in future.
In summary, we select WO3 as the substrate material for the c-axis growth of single crystalline SbSI nanorods, by optimizing and choosing CS2 (from NMP, DMF and CS2) as the solvent for SbI3. The higher crystallinity of SbSI offers a positive influence on the photostability. It was speculated that the SbSI/WO3 heterostructures follow the semiconductor–liquid junction (SCLJ) mechanism for the performance as photoanodes, whereas SbSI acts as a photoactive layer and WO3 dominates the band bending of the SbSI/WO3 photonanode–electrolyte interface. This work demonstrates a good strategy of utilizing SbSI nanostructures for high efficiency solar energy conversion.
