    , Accepted 17th January 2019First published on 17th January 2019AbstractFor their wide applications in wearable devices, flexible organic solar cells (FOSCs) should have high power conversion efficiency (PCE), bendable and even foldable flexibility, and low fabrication cost. Herein, all-solution-processed FOSCs based on flexible hybrid transparent electrodes (FTE) of Ag nanowires (NWs) combined with PEDOT:PSS PH1000 doped with a small amount of ethylene glycol (EG) were fabricated. The photovoltaic performance of FOSCs is closely related to the substrate and the content of EG. The optimal content of 6 vol% EG doped in PH1000 has a positive effect on electrical conductivity, surface morphology and even flexibility. These FOSCs yield the best PCE of 10.30% with a short-circuit current density of 19.17 mA cm−2 under optimal condition, which represent the highest efficiency reported to date for FOSCs with Ag NW electrodes. Furthermore, the optimal FOSCs demonstrate excellent mechanical flexibility, which can retain around 90% of the original PCE after 1000 bending cycles and exhibit over 75% of the original PCE even after complete folding. Our results demonstrate a new avenue to fabricate efficient and robust FOSCs with promising application potentials.
1. Introduction
The recent rapid progress of organic solar cells (OSCs) in terms of not only high efficiency1–3 but also stability4–6 demonstrates the bright future of OSCs in several applications. Flexibility, low cost and high efficiency are the three important factors to realize the commercialization of organic solar cells. Compared to rigid OSCs, flexible organic solar cells (FOSCs) deserve significant attention due to their robustness and promising application potential in wearable devices7 and even spaceships.8 Foldable flexibility should also be considered in practical applications such as in wearable devices, rechargeable bags and tents, and solar airships. A flexible substrate is an important part of solar cells and suitable for spin-coating, printing or roll-to-roll manufacturing;9,10 instead of traditional indium tin oxide (ITO), which is mechanically brittle11 and incurs a relatively high cost. Flexible electrodes, such as Ag nanowires (NWs),12,13 graphene,14,15 hybrid films,16,17 carbon nanotubes,18,19 and metal grids,20,21 have been reported as substrates for FOSCs. Among them, Ag NWs are one of the most suitable candidates as electrodes because of their abstractive mechanical flexibility, excellent conductivity, good transmittance, easy fabrication over large areas and low cost.
In 2008, Peumans et al.22 first reported that the Ag NW mesh was a great substitute for traditional metals as flexible transparent electrodes (FTE), which showed a 19% increase in photocurrent as compared to those based on ITO. After this, the first FOSCs were fabricated by You et al. based on the Ag NW/PET anode with PBnDT-DTffBT/PCBM as the active layer.23 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) reached 2.5% and remained 2.3% after 10 bending cycles. Kang et al.24 demonstrated that the flexibility of FOSCs based on Ag NW/PET was much higher than that of those based on ITO/PET, and a PCE of 5.02% was achieved using PTB7-F20:PC71BM as the active layer. Ma et al.13 reported an inverted flexible solar cell with a PCE of 6.58%; however, the flexibility of the FOSC was not investigated. Later, Seo et al.25 used cold isostatic pressing (CIP) to make highly conductive silver nanowire electrodes, and the PCE of the OSCs based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM increased up to 8.75%, which was the highest efficiency reported to date for the OSCs based on Ag NW electrodes.
Ag NW films as FTE suffer from electrical puncture without modification by the anode interfacial layers. A direct contact between the Ag NW film and the active layer led to high resistance and low efficiency. Since polymeric PET substrates cannot endure high temperatures, the inorganic semiconductors TiO226 and ZnO27 demanding high-temperature annealing cannot be utilized to modify the work function of the Ag NWs underlying the polymeric substrate. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is a promising alternative as an FTE in FOSCs28–30 because of its high transmittance, great conductivity, easy solution processing and flexibility. FOSCs with Ag NW/PEDOT:PSS composite electrodes have been reported13,31,32 with the highest efficiency of only 8.75%;28–30 this demonstrates that the achievement of 10% efficiency for FOSCs with a Ag NW substrate still remains a big challenge.
Herein, we report highly efficient bendable and foldable FOSCs based on hybrid electrodes containing Ag NW/PET films with different sheet resistance and PEDOT:PSS PH1000 doped with various amounts of ethylene glycol (EG) to enhance the conductivity. A systematic investigation was carried out to illustrate the influence of EG doping in PH1000 on the elementary composition, surface morphology, carrier mobility and device properties of PEDOT:PSS PH1000. In this study, 1% Zonyl was added to PH1000 as a fluorocarbon surfactant to enhance the wetting properties of PH1000 and thus enable its facile deposition on the PET substrate.33 A blend of poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexylthio)-4-fluorothiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PM6) and 3,9-bis(2-methylene-((3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-6,7-difluoro)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (IT-4F) was employed as the active layer, whereas poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium-propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)]dibromide (PFN-Br) was used as the cathode interfacial layer (Fig. S1†). Under optimal conditions, FOSCs with the structure PET/Ag NWs/PEDOT:PSS PH1000/PEDOT:PSS 4083/PM6:IT-4F/PFN-Br/Al exhibited the highest PCE of 10.30% with a Jsc of 19.17 mA cm−2. To the best of our knowledge, 10.3% efficiency is the highest reported value for flexible organic solar cells based on all kinds of Ag electrodes including Ag NWs, meshes and grids. Notably, the FOSCs with Ag NWs and PEDOT:PSS composite electrode displayed excellent mechanical robustness, retaining 90% of the initial efficiency after 1000 bending cycles (bending radius, r = 3 mm) and over 75% original efficiency after complete folding; these robust FOSCs illustrated application potentials in portable or wearable devices with large area at low cost.
2. Results and discussion
We first investigated the transmission spectra of PET underlying the Ag NW films and pristine PET. As plotted in Fig. 1a, the Ag NW film with 80 Ω sq−1 showed highest transmittance, especially in the 350–600 nm region. Although the Ag NW film with 25 Ω sq−1 had the best electrical conductivity, its transmittance was lowest due to the high content of Ag NWs, leading to a relatively lower performance of the corresponding FOSCs. Transmittance of the Ag NW films with 50 Ω sq−1 or 60 Ω sq−1 was roughly the same. Transmittance of the film with 50 Ω sq−1 was better than that of the film with 60 Ω sq−1 in the 300–600 nm region, but was slightly lower in the 600–850 nm region. As expected, the Ag NW film with 80 Ω sq−1 exhibited best transmittance. Fig. 1b shows the transparency spectra of Ag NW/PET/PH1000 without and with doping of EG at different contents. We calculated the figure of merit (FoM) using the following equation34,35 (1)where T(λ) is the transmittance at 550 nm, Rsheet is the sheet resistance, σdc is the direct current conductivity and σop is the optical conductivity.36,37 The FoM values for pure PH1000 and PH1000 containing 3, 6 or 9 vol% EG were 5.4, 35.8, 46.5 and 43.0 with the corresponding sheet resistances of 456 Ω, 70 Ω, 54 Ω and 62 Ω, respectively. All the FoM values were over 35, which indicated commercial viability.38,39 With EG doping, the transmittance slightly improved; this could be ascribed to the rearrangement of the PEDOT:PSS film and the slight reduction of thickness caused by the close packing of nanocrystals.40 Upon doping with 3 vol% or 6 vol% EG, the transparency spectra of Ag NW/PET/PH1000 showed no significant differences. Upon doping with 9 vol% EG, the transmittance improved by ca. 2.4% in the 650–850 nm region as compared to the case of 3 or 6 vol% EG doping. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out to illustrate the influence of EG doping on the composition of PEDOT:PSS. As shown in Fig. 2a–d, the thiophene rings of PEDOT and the sulfonate moieties of PSS corresponded to the binding energies (BEs) of 162–166 eV and 166–172 eV, respectively. For the film without EG doping, the ratios of –S– in PEDOT and –SO3H in PSS were 17.1 at% and 82.9 at%, respectively. Upon doping 3% or 6% EG, the ratio of –S– in PEDOT increased respectively to 20.9 at% and 23.0 at%. However, when the doping content of EG was increased to 9%, the ratio of –S– in PEDOT decreased to 20.3 at%. An appropriate doping amount and EG drop-casting treatment cause rearrangement of the PEDOT:PSS film as well as the removal of PSS.40 The accurate reason for this may need further exploration. Moreover, SO3H in PSS showed a similar variation trend with an increase in the doping content of EG. Generally, the solubility of PEDOT:PSS improves with an increase in the PSS content; however, the conductivity decreases owing to insulation of the transport of charges.41 Thus, there was a negative correlation between the content of PSS in PEDOT and the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS.40,42,43 Therefore, the conductivity of FTE containing 6 vol% of EG was the best.

To investigate the microstructure of the PEDOT:PSS (PH1000) based on the Ag NW films with different sheet resistances, atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of nine combinations were obtained. The root-mean-square roughness (RMS) of the three kinds of EG-doped Ag NW/PH 1000 films (Fig. 3a–i) was 1.66, 2.05, and 2.28 nm for the films with 50 Ω sq−1, 3.95, 4.27, and 5.33 nm for the films with 60 Ω sq−1, and 1.71, 1.93 and 2.01 nm for the films with 80 Ω sq−1, respectively. Obviously, the roughness increased with the increasing EG doping content. In particular, the increasing tendency of RMS for the Ag NW films with 60 Ω sq−1 was more obvious, and the surface became definitely rougher with the RMS > 5 nm upon doping with 9 vol% EG. Furthermore, it was clear that the size of the PEDOT-rich domains enhanced when the EG content was increased from 3 vol% to 6 vol%, which was beneficial to increase the electrical conductivity and fill factor (FF). However, when the EG content was increased to 9 vol%, the size of the abovementioned grains decreased, as clearly seen in Fig. 3e and f; this implied a decrease in conductivity.44 These results are in well agreement with the mobility characterization and performances of the FOSC devices as discussed hereinafter. The AFM images for PH1000 based on the Ag NW films with 25 Ω sq−1 are shown in Fig. S3,† and no further study has been performed due to its poor optical transmittance.

Fully solution-processed FOSCs with the architecture of PET/Ag NWs/PEDOT:PSS PH1000/PEDOT:PSS 4083/PM6:IT-4F/PFN-Br/Al were fabricated (see Fig. 4a), in which IT-4F served as the electron acceptor, PM6 served as the electron donor,45 and PFN-Br worked as the cathode interfacial layer. As shown in Fig. 4b, the energy levels of the layers matched very well; this could benefit the transport of carriers and improve the efficiency of the FOSCs. In this study, four kinds of Ag NW films with different sheet resistivities were chosen as substrates. At their best photovoltaic performance, the FOSCs achieved the PCEs of 8.33%, 9.50%, 10.30% and 8.34% for 25, 50, 60 and 80 Ω sq−1 Ag NW films, respectively. As abovementioned, due to poor transmittance, FOSCs based on the Ag NW film with 25 Ω sq−1 displayed the lowest PCE of 8.33%. Considering the transmittance, square resistance, as well as surface topography, the best PCE of FOSCs with the Ag NW film (60 Ω sq−1) as a substrate was over 10%. Fig. 4c shows the corresponding current-density–voltage (J–V) curves obtained under illumination. To investigate the effect of ethylene glycol doping on the photovoltaic performance, we have also fabricated FOSCs with FTE containing different contents of EG based on the 3 types of Ag NW films. As shown in the Table 1, when the content of EG was increased from 3 vol% to 6 vol%, the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and FF values of FOSCs enhanced, which were also highest among those of the corresponding devices and indicated efficient carrier transport and collection by the composite electrodes. Moreover, their respective calculated square resistance (Rsq) was lowest. This can be attributed to the favorable surface morphology and increased PEDOT-rich domains. On increasing the content of EG to 9 vol%, the current and FF decreased. On the one hand, it was caused by an increase in roughness; on the other hand, the reduction of PEDOT-rich domains was not conducive for the increment of Jsc. Fig. 4d–f display the J–V characteristics of FOSCs related to the values listed in Table 1. To verify the effect of additives on organic solar cells, we also fabricated OSCs based on the Ag NW film with 60 Ω sq−1 with pure PH1000 as the FTE, FTE containing 6 vol% EG and FTE containing 1 vol% Zonyl. As shown in Table S2,† the OSCs with pure PH1000 as the FTE showed efficiency as low as 3.36%, with Jsc of 16.67 mA cm−2 and FF of 27.16%. When only 6% EG was doped, the Jsc increased to 18.63 mA cm−2, and FF increased to 37.76%; this indicated that the main function of EG was to increase the current besides optimizing the surface. With only 1% Zonyl doping, the FF increased to 42.28%. These results demonstrated that 1% Zonyl and 6% EG had positive effects on OSCs.

Hole transportation, separation and collection are important processes occurring in the FTE layer. Thus, to characterize the hole mobility (μh) of the FOSC devices, space charge limited current (SCLC) model was adopted with the following
Mott–Gurney square law:46,47 (2)where ε0 represents the dielectric constant of vacuum, εr (∼3)46,47 represents the relative dielectric constant of active layers, Vappl represents the applied voltage, Vbi represents the built-in voltage and L (∼100 nm) represents the thickness of the blend film. Fig. 5 displays the J–V curves of the hole-only devices. The μh of FOSCs was calculated to be 0.96 × 10−5, 1.35 × 10−5, 1.80 × 10−5 and 0.82 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 25, 50, 60 and 80 Ω sq−1 Ag NWs films, respectively. After using PH1000 as the FTE, the sheet resistance values were 48, 51, 54 and 61 Ω for the composite electrodes based on 25, 50, 60 and 80 Ω sq−1 Ag NW films, respectively. The Ag NW films with higher square resistance have lesser silver nanowires and smoother surfaces. Hence, an active layer with better morphology could be formed on a smoother composite electrode. For the composite electrode based on the 80 Ω sq−1 Ag NWs film, the slightly lower μh was caused by a higher sheet resistance. All μh values were in the same order of magnitude with small differences. Moreover, based on the 60 Ω sq−1 Ag NW film, we investigated the effect of ethylene glycol doping on hole mobility. As shown in Fig. 5b, the devices without EG doping showed lowest hole mobility (μh = 3.98 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1), indicating low efficiency of the corresponding FOSCs. With doping of 3 vol% EG, the hole mobility significantly improved to 0.86 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. When the EG content was increased to 6 vol%, the hole mobility reached the highest value of μh = 1.80 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. Due to the highest carrier mobility, devices based on the FTE containing 6 vol% EG exhibited the best efficiency up to 10.30% with an increased Jsc of 19.17 mA cm−2 as well as an FF of 65.08%. When the EG content was increased to 9 vol%, the hole mobility decreased (μh = 1.21 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). These results for the hole mobility agreed well with the results of the photovoltaic performance of the FOSCs, XPS and surface morphology.

In addition to PCE, mechanical flexibility and durability during the bending cycles are crucial properties for the utilization of FOSC in devices such as wearables. Thus, we researched the flexibility of FOSCs based on 3 different substrates and with different contents of EG doped into FTE. In a nitrogen-filled glove box, FOSCs without encapsulation were subjected to continuous 1000 bending cycles. As shown in Fig. 6a–c, all the FOSCs based on the Ag NW films exhibited significant durability and flexibility. After 1000 times bending, most devices sustained around or over 80% of their original PCE, and the best devices even retained around 90% PCE owing to all-solution-processing method with non-multilative composite electrodes. FOSCs with FTE containing 6 vol% EG not only achieved the highest PCE but also displayed the best mechanical flexibility. Because PSS was stabilized by polar groups on one side of EG, the PEDOT nanocrystals rearranged from a benzoid to a quinoid structure due to the interaction between the other side of EG and the coil-like polymer chains next to the grain boundaries of PEDOT.40,41,48 The formation of a linear and more expanded chain network structure was conducive for both efficiency and robustness. Thus, 84.7%, 85.8% and 88.5% of the initial PCEs was retained by the FOSCs based on 50, 60 and 80 Ω sq−1 Ag NW films, respectively. Upon increasing the EG content to 9 vol%, this co-solvent effect seemed to get saturated, and an inter-granular fracture with enlarged PEDOT:PSS was formed.40,41 Furthermore, based on our results, the flexibility of FOSCs with FTE containing 9 vol% EG was better than that of FOSCs with FTE containing 3 vol% EG. Fig. 6d displays the J–V characteristics of the flexible Ag NW (60 Ω sq−1)/PET/FTE (6 vol% EG, 1 vol% Zonyl)/FOSCs with different bending cycles. J–V curves of all others corresponding to different bending cycles are shown in Fig. S7.† As shown in Fig. S6,† the FOSCs based on the Ag NW (25 Ω sq−1) films exhibited unfavorable flexibility and lowest PCE. We decided to not to investigate the effect of different doping contents of EG on the PCE and the corresponding bending tests. We have also provided the SEM images corresponding to the AgNW films with different sheet resistance values after the bending test in Fig. S10.† All the AgNWs had minor changes. This proves that the AgNW films are a good substrate for flexible OSCs because of the ductility of silver. To verify the active layer state after the bending test, AFM characterization of the active layer was carried out after 0, 50, 100, 200, 300, 500 and 1000 bending cycles. As shown in Fig. S11,† the active layer showed a very good surface morphology before bending, and the amount and depth of creases increased with the increasing bending cycles. Small empty holes started appearing from 300 bending cycles. Although RMS calculated from the height image is 2–3 nm, these creases and empty holes are not conducive for carrier transportation. This was one of the reasons for the decrease of Jsc and FF after the bending cycles.

(d) J–V characteristics of the flexible Ag NWs (60 Ω sq−1)/PET/FTE (6 vol% EG, 1 vol% Zonyl)/FOSCs with different bending cycles. 
To investigate the limit bending-flexibility of the FOSCs, we totally folded the FOSCs in the middle region (loading time: > 60 s) after 1000 bending cycles. This led to a vertical warping, and then, we spread it out again to measure its photovoltaic performance (Fig. S5†). All the performance parameters of the folded FOSCs are listed in Table 2. Note that all the FOSCs retained over 60% of their initial PCEs even after the harsh bending process. The best device retained over 75% efficiency, indicating potential applications in some extreme situations. As shown by the J–V characteristics of the folded FOSCs in Fig. S8,† the limit-bending flexibility of the FOSCs based on Ag NWs (80 Ω sq−1) was best; this was probably due to the presence of minimum silver nanowires in PET. Consequently, the amount of broken silver nanowires would also be least.

3. Conclusion
In summary, the Ag NW (60 Ω sq−1) film was the preferable substrate due to the mutual restriction of square resistance and transmittance. Moreover, the carrier mobility, surface morphology, PCE and flexibility were greatly influenced by the volume percent of EG. We found that 6 vol% EG was optimal. The best performance of FOSCs was achieved as Voc of 0.825 V, Jsc of 19.17 mA cm−2, FF of 65.08% and PCE of 10.30% based on the optimal condition, which is the highest reported PCE in FOSCs based on Ag NW films (see Fig. S12†). All the FOSCs maintained significant bending flexibility and retained over 80% of the initial PCE after 1000 cycles. Among them, the FOSCs with FTE containing 6 vol% EG also exhibited the best mechanical flexibility. According to our results, the limit-bending flexibility of FOSCs turned out to be significant (around 75% of initial PCE) even after total folding. Therefore, these FOSCs based on the Ag NW film with FTE containing 6 vol% EG are promising for applications in wearable or portable devices in the future market.
4. Experimental
4.1. Materials
PM6, IT-4F and PFN-Br were purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc, Beijing. The Ag nanowire films were purchased from Gu's New Material, Suzhou. 1,8-Diiodooctane, ethylene glycol and dehydrated chlorobenzene were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific Chemicals Co., Ltd. Zonyl FS-610 was purchased from DuPont Co., Ltd. The PEDOT:PSS aqueous solutions of Clevios PH1000 and Clevios P VP 4083 were purchased from Heraeus, Germany.
4.2. Preparation of the PH1000 FTEs
The Ag nanowire films were washed sequentially in an ultrasonic bath with deionized (DI) water, acetone, and isopropanol. A PEDOT: PSS aqueous solution (Clevios PH1000, Heraeus, Germany) with 1 vol% Zonyl FS-610 was doped with ethylene glycol at different contents (i.e., 3, 6 or 9 vol%) and then filtered through a 0.45 μm syringe filter. The pristine PEDOT: PSS films were formed by spin-coating the abovementioned PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution on the Ag nanowire films of size 1.5 × 1.5 cm2 at 2400 rpm for 50 s. After this, the pristine films were annealed at 110 °C for 15 min on a hot plate. Then, the drop casting treatment was carried out by dipping the ethylene glycol droplets on the pristine films at 100 °C for 15 min. After this, the films were washed thrice with DI water and isopropanol. Finally, the PH1000 FTEs (∼40 nm) were obtained after drying the washed films at 110 °C for 15 min.
4.3. Fabrication of devices
The conventional device structure was Ag nanowire films/PH1000 FTE/PEDOT:PSS, (Clevios P VP 4083)/PM6:IT-4F/PFN-Br/Al. Indium materials were pasted at two corners to form favorable electrical contacts. The PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution (Clevios P VP Al 4083) was filtered through a 0.45 μm syringe filter and spin-coated at 3500 rpm for 60 s onto the PH1000 FTEs. Then, an anode buffer layer was formed via annealing at 110 °C for 30 min. After this, on the top of the anode buffer layer, an active layer of PM6: IT-4F (1:1 w/w, 20 mg mL−1 of total concentration) in chlorobenzene with 0.6 vol% of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as an additive was spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 60 s and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The thickness of the PM6: IT-4F active layer was ∼100 nm. Next, PFN-Br dissolved in methanol (0.5 mg mL−1) was spin-coated on the active layers at 3000 rpm for 60 s as an interface layer (thickness: 5 nm). The films were then transferred into a vacuum chamber for evaporation. Finally, Al electrodes (thickness: 100 nm) were deposited at a pressure of 5 × 10−5 Pa over a precise area of 4.0 mm2. Under dark condition, hole-only devices with the configuration Ag nanowire films/PH1000 FTE/PEDOT: PSS (4083)/PM6: IT-4F/MoO3 (10 nm)/Al (100 nm) were fabricated and characterized for the space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements.
4.4. Characterization and measurements
The film thickness was investigated by a surface profile-meter (Dektak 150, Veeco). Film conductivity was analyzed by the van der Pauw four-point probe technique using the Keithley 2400 Source Meter. Transmission spectra were obtained using a spectrophotometer (Lambda 950, Perkin-Elmer). Film morphology was investigated by atomic force microscopy (Dimension 3100, Vecco) and scanning electron microscopy (Verios G4 UC, Thermo scientific). Chemical compositions and chemical states of the component elements were analyzed using XPS (Axis Ultra DLD, Kratos). Using a source meter (Keithley 2440) in combination with an AM 1.5 G solar simulator (Newport-Oriel® Sol3A 450 W), the current–voltage (J–V) curves of the solar cells were characterized in a nitrogen-filled glove box. The intensity of the simulated solar light was calibrated with a standard Si photodiode detector. For the evaluation of device flexibility, the solar cells were repeatedly bended on a cylinder with a radius of 3 mm, after which their optoelectronic properties were characterized.
