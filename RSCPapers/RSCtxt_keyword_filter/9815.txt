    , Accepted 16th June 2020First published on 17th June 2020AbstractBlack phosphorus (BP) is a promising anode material for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) due to its extremely high theoretical capacity. However, the large volume change and breaking of the layered structure result in rapid capacity decay during cycling. Herein, our in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) study reveals the highly anisotropic Na diffusion and the formation of alternating layered and amorphous lamellas in BP nanosheets with small volume expansion induced by partial sodiation. Inspired by these results, we investigate systematically the cyclability of BP at controlled discharge capacities using half-cell SIBs, expecting to achieve good cyclability by sacrificing some of the capacity and preserving the layered structure of BP. Our results show that the cycling stability of BP is obviously improved by controlling the capacity appropriately. When the discharge capacity is limited at 400 mA h g−1, the half-cell can sustain more than 100 cycles with an active material mass loading of ∼2 mg cm−2, which is at least 4 times longer than when the capacity is limited at 600 mA h g−1 or above. The in situ TEM and electrochemical tests indicate that maintaining the layered structure by controlling the capacity is key to improve the cyclability of BP as an anode in SIBs.
Introduction
Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) attract enormous attention from researchers due to the abundant sodium resources in Earth and environmental friendliness of sodium.1 SIBs are highly promising to be used for large-scale green electrical energy storage technologies in the future, e.g. home storage, off-grid housing, optimization of power grids and localized energy storage at the location of wind and solar farms.3 Although SIBs have a similar rocking-chair structure to lithium ion batteries (LIBs) and the knowledge and technology for developing LIBs can be partially transferred to the development of SIBs,2 the investigation of suitable anode materials for SIBs is still in its infancy and few electrode materials meet the performance requirement for practical applications. The major challenge for ambient-temperature SIBs is the lack of suitable negative electrodes with high energy density and stable cyclability, which has seriously hindered the commercialization of SIBs. The electrode materials used in LIBs may not be capable of insertion of Na+ ions because the ionic radius of Na+ is larger than that of Li+ ions. For example, graphite, the commercial anode material for LIBs, shows extremely low capacity for SIBs, with only forming NaC64 when there is no solvent-co-intercalation in layers. Many extensively studied materials, such as Si-based materials,4 with alloying or conversion reaction in LIBs, have no reaction activity with sodium ions at all. Therefore, numerous attempts have been made to find suitable anodes for SIBs.5
Recently, black phosphorus (BP) has aroused great attention for various applications,6–11e.g., field effect transistors (FETs),12 humidity13 and metal ion sensing,14 and batteries,15,16 due to its unique electric properties and orthorhombic structure. BP (space group: Cmca)17 is composed of puckered layers built of P6 rings, and each phosphorus atom is covalently bonded to three other phosphorus atoms. The layers are stacked together via weak van der Waals forces. The distance between adjacent layers is 5.4 Å.18 BP shows potentially excellent electrochemical performance for both LIBs and SIBs.19,20 A high theoretical specific capacity of 2596 mA h g−1 can be achieved based on its sodiation mechanism (P + 3Na+ + 3e− → Na3P), which is approximately seven times higher than that of the graphite negative electrode used for LIBs (372 mA h g−1). However, black phosphorus as a SIB negative electrode has significant defects, including instability when it is exposed to water and oxygen conditions, and fast capacity decay during cycling.10,21–23 To solve these problems, modifying the structure or composition of BP24–28 by introducing other materials such as graphene and carbon nanotubes25,29 has been proposed and verified as an effective measure to protect BP from reacting with oxygen to form PxOy and improve the cycling stability.12,30
The electrochemical sodiation mechanism of BP is generally revealed to be a two-step process in series: an intercalation process along the pucker channels, followed by an alloying reaction transforming the layered structure to sodium phosphide (Na3P).8,31–33 The intercalation expands the interlayer spacing but preserves the layered structure of black phosphorus, while the alloying process breaks the P–P bonds and forms amorphous NaP which is further transformed into crystalline Na3P.8,31–33 Calculations have shown that, due to the different sodium diffusion barriers in different directions (0.18 eV in the [100] direction and >0.76 eV in the [010] and [001] directions), the Na+ transport at the initial intercalation was suggested to be anisotropic and may cause atomic stack reordering.8,31,33,34 However, experimental evidence for the anisotropic intercalation and atomic stack reordering still remains lacking, and their influence on the cycling performance of BP is not clarified yet.
Here we reveal through in situ TEM that partial sodiation can lead to the formation of a laminate structure of an alternating crystalline phase and amorphous phase, appearing as multiple stripes in BP nanosheets. The laminate structure is expected to be beneficial to the cycling performance of BP as it leads to a small volume expansion, and can improve the structural stability during cycling. Thus, we further investigate systematically the cyclability of pristine BP at different discharge capacities (400 mA h g−1, 600 mA h g−1, 800 mA h g−1, 1000 mA h g−1 and fully discharged, corresponding to the sodiation depth of 15%, 23%, 30%, 38%, and 100%, respectively) using half-cell SIBs. It is found that the cycling stability of BP is obviously improved by controlling the capacity appropriately. When the specific discharge capacity is limited at 400 mA h g−1, the half-cell can sustain more than 100 cycles with a high active material mass loading (∼2 mg cm−2) at a current density of 100 mA g−1, which is at least 4 times longer than when the capacity is limited at 600 mA h g−1 or above. The in situ TEM and electrochemical tests indicate that maintaining the layered structure by controlling the capacity is key to improve the cyclability of BP as an anode in Na-ion batteries.
Experimental
Synthesis of BP nanosheets
BP nanosheets were prepared by a liquid-phase exfoliation method.14,21,30,32,35 Pristine BP was dispersed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) at a concentration of 1 mg ml−1 and sonicated in a tip sonic with a power of 800 W for 3 h in an ice-water bath. The resultant dispersion was centrifuged for 15 min at 500 rpm to remove sediments to obtain the supernatant. Then, the supernatant was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min. The color of the dispersion changed from brown to yellow, indicating different concentrations of BP. After centrifugation, decantation was carried out by pipetting off the top dispersion and the remaining part was washed with ethyl alcohol to remove the NMP.
Material characterization
The structure and phase information of the BP nanosheets was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker-D2, Germany) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) in the range of 10° to 80°. The Rietveld refinement was performed using FullProf software to analyze the structure of the black phosphorus. The BP nanosheet was attached to a gold wire to build an in situ Na-ion nanobattery inside the TEM. The partial sodiation experiments were carried out inside a JEOL JEMARM200CF STEM.
Electrochemical measurements
The electrode slurry contained 75 mg of pristine black phosphorus, 15 mg Ketjenblack,36 and 15 mg of sodium carboxmethylcellulose (NaCMC) binder37 in ultra-pure water. The slurry was stirred by hand-milling for 40 min, then was casted onto Cu foil. Finally, it was dried at 70 °C for 5 h. The specific capacity was calculated based on the weight of the pristine black phosphorus, and the active material mass loading was ∼2 mg cm−2. Half-cells were assembled in an Ar-filled glove box (<0.5 ppm for both oxygen and H2O) using BP as the working electrode, a sodium metal disk as the counter and reference electrode, glass fiber as the separator, and 1 mol L−1 NaClO4 in an ethylene carbonate (EC)–diethyl carbonate (DEC) solution with addition of 5 vol% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as the electrolyte. Coin cells were sealed using a hydraulic crimping machine.
Galvanostatic charge–discharge curves, cycling performance and rate capabilities were measured between 0.05 V and 2.5 V (vs. Na/Na+) on a CT2001A LAND test system at 25 °C. The batteries were cycled with a current density of 0.1C (1C = 1000 mA g−1). The partial sodiation strategy was chosen to investigate the cycling performance of the BP electrode. In capacity-control tests, the sodiation process is terminated at a preset value of sodiation capacity which was then followed by the desodiation process. The cut-off voltage during sodiation decreases as the cycles increase as shown in Fig. S5.† Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed at a scan rate of 50 μV s−1. The first sweep scanning interval is from open circuit voltage to 0.005 V, and the scan range is from 2.5 V to 0.005 V for the latter three cycles.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a displays the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the as-prepared BP nanosheets, which is consistent with the standard XRD pattern of pure black phosphorus (PDF#47-1626). The diffraction peaks at 17.08°, 26.74°, 34.45° and 52.54° correspond to the crystal planes of (020), (021), (040) and (060), respectively. The Rietveld refinement (Rp = 13.3, Rwp = 14.3, Rexp = 7.99 and χ2 = 3.21) conducted by using FullProf software confirms the Cmca space group of the BP nanosheets, and the lattice parameters are refined to be a = 3.316 Å, b = 10.483 Å, and c = 4.38 Å. The crystal structure of the BP nanosheets was also examined by TEM. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the BP nanosheets collected along the [110] zone axis is shown in Fig. 1b, which indicates their high crystallinity and single-crystal structure. Fig. 1d shows the HRTEM image of the BP nanosheets. The d-spacings along the two directions marked in Fig. 1d are found to be about 0.2602 nm, corresponding to the (1) plane and (1) plane, respectively. Fig. 1e shows the EDS mapping of the BP nanosheet, and it can be seen that the P element is uniformly distributed in the BP nanosheet. These characterization results show that the BP nanosheets have a high crystallinity and a single crystal structure.

Fig. 2 shows the TEM image and the elemental mapping of the partially sodiated BP nanosheet, which reveals the chemistry of the reaction front. The sodium source is loaded onto the Nanofactory holder (as marked by red dashed circles in Fig. 2a) directly touching the BP nanosheet, and forming a nanobattery under in situ TEM. Fig. 2b and c show that phosphorus and sodium can be found throughout the whole area. Oxygen can be detected in the nanosheet (Fig. 2c), which is due to the diffusion of oxygen from the Na2O formed on the surface of the sodium metal to the BP nanosheet. In order to gain more insight into the structural evolution of the BP nanosheets during the partial sodiation, the atomic-scale HAADF and ABF images were acquired and analyzed.

The HAADF and ABF images of the BP nanosheets after the partial sodiation exhibit clearly many dark-contrast (Fig. 3a) or bright-contrast (Fig. 3b) stripes, revealing a highly anisotropic diffusion38 for the sodium ions in BP, which is consistent with the first-principles calculations in the literature.33 The favorable diffusion pathway of the sodium ions is expected to be along the [100] direction because of its relatively low energy barrier.33 A closer examination of the crystal structure of the partially sodiated BP nanosheets was done by analyzing the ABF-STEM images. Interestingly, the partially sodiated BP nanosheets present a laminate structure of an alternating crystalline phase and amorphous phase, as shown in Fig. 3c. The crystalline part maintains the layered structure of BP, as evidenced by the FFT pattern (Fig. 3e) and the simulated DP (Fig. 3f). The amorphous part results from the alloying of the BP with sodium to form the NaP phase.39 The ABF-STEM image along the [101] direction also confirms the laminate structure of the partially sodiated BP nanosheets. The formation of the laminate structure is in line with the well-established sodiation mechanism of BP – an intercalation process followed by an alloying reaction39 and the present work reveals further at the atomic scale how the structure of the BP evolves in the initial stage of the sodiation. In the first step of sodiation, the sodium ions intercalate into BP along the pucker channels ([100] direction), expanding the interlayer spacing but maintain the layered structure of BP.40 Secondly, further insertion of sodium ions breaks the P–P covalent bonds and transforms the layered structure to an amorphous NaP phase. Our experimental observations demonstrate for the first time that the formation and morphology of the amorphous NaP phase layers are sandwiched by crystalline BP phase nanosheets. A final transformation of the amorphous NaP phase to the crystalline Na3P in the fully sodiated stage is not discussed in the present work.41 The laminate structure is schematically illustrated in Fig. 3g that the crystalline phase and amorphous phase distribute layer-by-layer, and the Na atoms are intercalated in the pucker channels along the [100] direction in the crystalline phase.

The in situ TEM results provide crucial insight into the sodiation process of BP, which is of importance to improve the electrochemical performance of BP-based materials for SIBs. The poor electrochemical performance, especially the poor cycling stability, of BP generally originates from the alloying-induced large volume expansion and structural failure. Preserving effectively the integrity of the whole electrode materials is key to improving the cycling stability. The formation of the laminate structure implies that the high cycling stability could be achieved by partial sodiation, i.e., by controlling the discharge capacity appropriately. It is worth noting that the laminate structure preserved partially the crystal structure of BP and the slices of the amorphous phase are very thin in thickness (<2 nm), as shown in Fig. 3c. Meanwhile, the partial sodiation will result in much smaller volume expansion in comparison with full sodiation. Thereby, a high structural stability and cycling stability can be achieved. To verify the above presumption, we investigated systematically the cyclability of the BP as the SIB electrode at different discharge capacities using half-cells. Fig. 4a shows the potential profiles of the BP under full charge–discharge conditions at a current density of 100 mA g−1 between 0.005 V and 2.5 V. A high specific discharge/charge capacity of 2025.8/1555.7 mA h g−1 is obtained in the first cycle with an initial coulombic efficiency of 76.8%. However, the half-cell fails within merely three full cycles. Fig. 4b–e show the potential profiles of selected cycles when the discharge capacity is limited to be 1000 mA h g−1, 800 mA h g−1, 600 mA h g−1, and 400 mA h g−1, respectively. The discharge curve of the first cycle under fully discharged conditions presents obviously two plateaus which correspond to the two reduction peaks observed in the cyclic voltammetry curves (the first cycle) in Fig. S3,† indicating two structural transitions in sequence of the BP during sodiation. It is seen that the second plateau, corresponding to the alloying reaction with Na, is gradually shortened with decreasing the discharge capacity and completely disappears when the capacity is set to be 400 mA h g−1. As discussed previously, full alloying of the BP is averse to the structural stability during sodiation–desodiation cycling, and high structural stability can be achieved by controlling the sodiation process which is realized through limiting the discharge capacity here. Fig. 4f shows that the cyclability of the BP is extensively improved by limiting the discharge capacity to be 400 mA h g−1, and the capacity remains almost 100% after 100 cycles. However, the half-cells can be cycled only 7, 16 and 28 times when the discharge capacity is limited to be 1000 mA h g−1, 800 mA h g−1, and 600 mA h g−1, respectively. The electrochemical test demonstrates that the cycling performance of the BP can be improved by limiting the discharge capacity to be 400 mA h g−1. This is reasonable by taking the above in situ TEM analysis into consideration. Because the capacity of 400 mA h g−1 corresponds to a global Na concentration of ∼0.15 in the BP, which is lower than the Na concentration needed for the formation of amorphous NaP alloys, it is expected that the laminate structure of the alternating crystalline phase and amorphous phase by intercalation is formed during cycling. The comparison of the XRD patterns before and after cycling (Fig. S5†) further indicates that the crystal structure of BP is partially maintained when the discharge capacity is limited to be 400 mA h g−1. The electrochemical performance of BP at controlled current densities of 100 mA g−1, 200 mA g−1, and 1000 mA g−1 when the discharge specific capacity is limited to 400 mA h g−1 is shown in Fig. 4g. Although the cycling performance degrades with increasing current density, the BP electrode still sustains more than 40 cycles at 1 A g−1, much better than the cycling performance when the discharge capacity is controlled at 600 mA h g−1 and above. Thereby, a high structural stability is achieved, resulting in improved cycling performance, although the coulombic efficiency decreases gradually in the last few cycles.

The morphology of the BP electrode after cycling at different discharge capacities of 400 mA h g−1 and 1000 mA h g−1 was characterized by TEM, as shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5a shows that the BP maintains an intact particle shape after 5 cycles at a controlled capacity of 400 mA h g−1. Meanwhile, the HRTEM image (Fig. 5b) demonstrates that the crystalline structure of BP was partially maintained (as marked by the green circles) and some disordered structures were also observed (as marked by the red circles). The d-spacing of the (1) crystal plane after cycling was found to be 0.26 nm, slightly larger than that of the pristine BP (0.2564 nm). In contrast, no BP particles can be found any longer after 5 cycles at a controlled discharge capacity of 1000 mA h g−1, as shown in Fig. 5c. At higher resolution, it is found that some tiny amorphous-like nanoparticles can be observed. Thus, it can be concluded that the BP electrode exhibits much higher structural stability and particle integrity when the discharge capacity is limited to 400 mA h g−1 than when limited to 1000 mA h g−1, which results in much better cycling performance at a controlled capacity of 400 mA h g−1.

Conclusions
The in situ TEM study shows that Na ions initially prefer to diffuse along the [100] direction in the BP crystal, and partial sodiation could lead to the formation of alternating layered and amorphous lamellas in BP nanosheets with small volume expansion. To further investigate the influence of the laminate structure on the cycling performance of BP as an anode for SIBs, the half-cells assembled using pristine BP are cycled under controlled discharge capacities, e.g. 1000 mA h g−1, 800 mA h g−1, 600 mA h g−1, and 400 mA h g−1. It is found that, with the decrease of the controlled discharge capacity, the cycle numbers increase from 8 to >100, indicating that the layered structure of BP is destroyed seriously when cycled at high capacities (e.g. 1000 mA h g−1). The layered structure of BP survives at a low discharge capacity and leads to a much larger cycle number. Our results indicate that maintaining the layered structure is of vital importance to realize high cycling performance of BP as an electrode of SIBs.
