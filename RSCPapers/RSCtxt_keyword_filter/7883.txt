Introduction
The improvement in the performance by scaling of silicon-based metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) has gained the attention of the semiconductor industry for the past few decades. On the other hand, with the uninterrupted reduction in size and the exponential upsurge in the number of transistors, the performance of the devices has decreased because of the short channel effects (SCEs) that put a limit on further size reduction.1 There is an urge to invent new methods and materials to tackle these issues. The discovery of graphene is one kind of revolution that opens up several possibilities and opportunities in the field of the semiconductor industry.2
Graphene has attracted significant attention because of its captivating electronics, and thermal, magnetic, and mechanical characteristics.3 The extraordinary value of the mobility of graphene (>200000 cm2 V−1 s−1) provides new horizons for emerging optoelectronic devices. The ultrahigh mobility appears because of its zero-bandgap nature which leads to a low On/Off current ratio that restricts its applications in the industry.4 Therefore, it is compulsory to realize a two-dimensional material with a tunable bandgap that can be used in multi-functional nanoscale devices. These requirements lead researchers to explore two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D-TMDs).5
The van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures made by assembling TMD materials are considered to be more capable and flexible because of sharp interfaces and high compatibility interfaces.6 Though, the rectifying behavior because of the sharp interface in 2D-TMD vdW heterostructures is a debatable matter, in this viewpoint, the role of contact resistance in devices is highlighted to improve the rectifying behavior. Researchers have reported a high diode rectification ratio in TMD heterostructures.7–9 To design extraordinary optoelectronic devices, the TMD based heterostructures have been introduced. To construct FETs, sensors, MOSFETs, and photovoltaics, the heterostructures that consist of TMDs/TMDs are preferred over TMDs and metal oxide semiconductor heterostructures.10,11 Various methods have been used for the design of p–n diodes with a high rectification ratio. In such techniques (chemical and electrostatic doping), the density of charge carriers is regulated successfully but short-term instability and degradation of the performance of devices are observed.12,13
The successful design and control of the functionalities of FETs, photodetectors, flexible sensors, and photovoltaics have been demonstrated by using TMDs. A TMD material, black phosphorus (BP) which is intrinsically p-type, was introduced with large hole charge carrier density and an improved value of the on/off current ratio. It is unstable in air and easily oxidized that limits its functionalities in practical applications.13 A 2D material, gallium telluride (GaTe), is an intrinsically p-type TMD with a direct bandgap of ∼1.7 eV.14 GaTe MOSFETs show an on/off current ratio of up to 105 with minor gate hysteresis. Additionally, the hole charge carrier density is easily controlled by regulating the thermally activated Ga vacancies. Large-scale growth of multilayered GaTe with excellent features is considered an important approach for optoelectronics applications.15 So, GaTe has also incredible potential for designing n and p-MOSFETs.
On the other hand, a hafnium-based TMD semiconductor has a small bandgap and high work function with high electron charge carriers that make it appropriate for electronic and optoelectronic applications.16 Recently, it has been suggested theoretically (density functional theory) that HfSe2 is a suitable n-type channel material. Furthermore, its electrical properties are strongly based on the strain. The bandgap of HfSe2 has a strong dependence on the lattice parameters. So, HfSe2 is an n-type TMD with a bandgap of 1.1 eV.17,18
In this work, we demonstrate a gallium telluride (p-GaTe)/hafnium diselenide (n-HfSe2) heterostructure photodiode with strong rectifying behavior that is modulated by an external voltage. An extraordinary rectification ratio (RR) of 6.3 × 105 at a back gate voltage (Vbg = −40 V) has been achieved because of Ohmic contacts. Furthermore, the photovoltaic parameters of the p-GaTe/n-HfSe2 photodiode were studied under laser light at different illumination intensities (20–100 μW). An astonishing photoresponsivity of  and external quantum efficiency (EQE = 54%) were perceived under the laser light. A fast photoresponse was observed under the laser light. The gate-modulation of rectifying behavior and photovoltaic outcomes is of prodigious significance in optoelectronics which might be helpful in growing greatly effective devices.
Results and discussion
The schematic illustration of the GaTe/HfSe2 vdW heterostructure photodiode is displayed in Fig. 1(a). The optical image of the GaTe/HfSe2 photodiode is demonstrated in Fig. 1(b). Firstly, GaTe TMD materials were mechanically exfoliated and transferred on the SiO2/p-Si substrate. The nanoflake of HfSe2 is precisely transferred over GaTe with the help of a micro-aligner. To check the surface and thickness, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used. The thicknesses of GaTe and HfSe2 are 13 nm and 17 nm respectively, and are presented in the ESI,† Fig. S1(a)–(c). We have tested multiple samples to observe the rectification of each sample as shown in Fig. 1(c) which indicates the self-consistency in the obtained outcomes. The thickness of each sample was similar which is confirmed by using AFM. The surface characterization of GaTe and HfSe2 was investigated with Raman spectroscopy. The Raman spectra of GaTe, HfSe2, and GaTe/HfSe2 heterostructures are presented in Fig. 1(d). The identification and purity of crystals of p-GaTe and n-HfSe2 were confirmed and the observed peaks matched with previously reported results.18,19 The types of charge carriers in GaTe were confirmed with the transfer (Ids–Vbg) curve at a constant Vds = 1 V, which confirms the p-type nature of GaTe. Vbg was swept in the ±40 V range and the current (Ids) was measured. A threshold was observed at ∼8 V during negative to positive gate-voltage sweep as revealed in Fig. 2(a), with an on/off current of up to 1 × 104. To confirm the n-type behavior of the HfSe2 device, Vbg was swept in the ±40 V range under a constant Vds = 1 V. A threshold appeared at ∼−25 V during the positive to negative Vbg sweep (Fig. 2(b)), which confirms that the HfSe2 sheet was n-type. The maximum ON/OFF current ratio of the HfSe2 sheet was measured as 6.1 × 106, which is significantly higher than that of the p-GaTe sheets. For low barrier Schottky contact,31 the electrodes were designed by the standard photolithography and electron beam (e-beam) lithography technique. A Pd layer (6 nm) was deposited on the p-type GaTe followed by a 60 nm thick Au capping layer with the help of a thermal evaporator. The linear behavior of the current–voltage curves is displayed in Fig. 2(c) at various Vbg which verifies the ohmic behavior due to the low potential barrier between GaTe and Pd. The Ti (6 nm)/Au (60 nm) contacts were deposed on HfSe2 to prevent Schottky contribution32–34 and the current–voltage curves indeed show the ohmic behavior as shown in Fig. 2(d). To observe the electrical performances, the Ion/Ioff current and mobility (μFE) of p-GaTe and n-HfSe2 were measured. The μFE of both materials was extracted by using a relation given as:20 (1)where L and W indicate the channel length and width,  gives the slopes, and (Cbg ∼ 115 aF μm2) represents the gate capacitance. The estimated μFE values of 50 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 75 cm2 V−1 s−1 with GaTe and HfSe2, respectively, are better than those of the other TMD FETs on SiO2 substrates.21–24 Fundamentally, the linear behavior of the current–voltage (Ids−Vds) curves is based on the difference of work function of metals and TMDs (metal–TMD junction). That is why the Pd contacts for GaTe and Ti for HfSe2 were used to tune the charge carrier density (holes and electrons) into GaTe and HfSe2, respectively.25 These metal contacts produced negligible potential barriers to form ohmic contacts that give linear current–voltage characteristics.26,27

To investigate the Schottky barrier between two metals (Pd and Ti) connected with p-GaTe and n-HfSe2, the electrical measurements were achieved at various temperatures as presented in Fig. 3(a and b) respectively. The Schottky barrier height ϕB is calculated for Pd-GaTe and Ti-HfSe2 as revealed in Fig. 3(c and d) by using the standard current model for thermionic emission given as (2)in eqn (2). The symbol A represents the area of the junction, A* is the effective Richardson constant, q is the elementary charge, kB is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature, respectively. In Fig. 3(c) for p-GaTe and Fig. 3(d) for n-HfSe2,  is plotted vs. which is used for the estimation of ϕB height at metal–TMD junctions. The values of ϕB for Pd-GaTe and Ti-HfSe2 are extracted in the range of 40 meV and 27 meV respectively. Fig. 4(a) and (b) shows the band diagram of metals (Ti and Pd) with HfSe2 and GaTe TMD materials before and after the contact formations. The Ti (ϕTi < ϕHfSe2) and Pd (ϕPd ≥ ϕGate) metal contacts are used for n-HfSe2 and p-GaTe respectively to form ohmic contacts due to the very small potential barrier.

Gate-dependent rectification ratio of the p-GaTe/n-HfSe2 vdW photodiode
To estimate the rectifying behavior of the p-GaTe/n-HfSe2 vdW photodiode, the current voltage (Ids–Vds) curves are measured at different Vbg (Fig. S4(a), ESI†). The Ids–Vds characteristics in the semi-log scale at various Vbg values are shown in Fig. 5(a). The Vds was swept from +5 V to −5 V at each Vbg. We observed an extraordinary rectifying current that is successfully controlled with the Vbg. At positive gate voltages, the forward, as well as reverse currents increase simultaneously that quashes the rectification ratio “the ratio between the forward and reverse currents.” At −Vbg, a large value of the rectification ratio is obtained because of a decrease in reverse or leakage current in the GaTe/HfSe2 photodiode. At Vbg = −40 V, the change in If is small, while the Ir is significantly reduced that enhances the rectification ratio up to 6.3 × 105.

(b) The RR plotted as a function of Vbg which also shows the comparison with previously reported literature. (c) The current across the p-GaTe/n-HfSe2, p–n junction plotted on the semi-log scale as a function of Vds. The slope from the fitting is used to calculate the ideality factor (d) η of the GaTe/HfSe2 vdW heterostructure as a function of Vbg. 
The huge modulation in the rectification characteristics as a function of gate voltages was attributed to the carrier density and electrostatic inversion of TMDs from semiconducting to the semi-insulating nature.28,29 In this work, a higher RR was accomplished for the p-GaTe/n-HfSe2 photodiode than those for the previously reported TMD based p–n devices.30–35Fig. 5(b) displays the variation in RR with Vbg in comparison with previous reports. Moreover, the reverse current through HfSe2 is small as compared with GaTe which also causes an increase in the RR at the negative Vbg. The relation for output current in the GaTe/HfSe2 photodiode is given by the Shockley diode equation as:36 (3)
In eqn (3), Io is the reverse saturation current, q denotes the elementary charge,  is the ideality factor, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T indicates the temperature. Fig. 5(c) indicates the graph between lnI and Vds. The ideality factor is estimated by finding the slope in the linear region. η estimated from fitting the lnIds–Vds curves in a small forward-bias regime at various Vbg values is shown in Fig. 5(d). The ideality factor was determined to be 1.12 at VG = −40 V which is very close to the ideality factor of an ideal diode (η = 1). At the positive gate voltage values, the ideality factor approached ∼2. These findings show the significant improvement in the η for the GaTe/HfSe2 photodiode as compared to the η in previously reported literature.29,37
The reduction in η revealed that the recombination rate is decreased at the sharp interface of the GaTe/HfSe2 photodiode under the electric field. We believe that the efficiency of the GaTe/HfSe2 photodiode can be improved if the polymer residual impurities and water vapors at the interface are removed effectively. The effect of thickness on the RR is also studied. A small RR is conceived in thin TMD based devices because of a large leakage current.25,38 To check the effect of thickness on the performance of the GaTe/HfSe2 vdW heterostructure, the devices were characterized with different thicknesses of each material. First, the thickness of GaTe was varied (0.8 nm–13 nm) and the thickness of HfSe2 (17 nm) remained constant (Fig. S5(a), ESI†). The rectification ratio was increased with increasing thickness of GaTe (Fig. S5(b), ESI†).
Furthermore, we also change the thickness of HfSe2 from 0.61 nm to 17 nm and estimated the rectification ratio (Fig. S5(c) and (d), ESI†). The thickness of GaTe (13 nm) remained constant. In both cases, the rectification ratio was increased with the thickness of each material. In the monolayer and bilayer case of each material, we observed a large leakage current because of direct tunneling through the materials. In the case of mono and bi-layers, the barrier width is so small and electrons can easily tunnel through the thin depletion region. Therefore, ineffective rectification occurs. But in the case of a multi-layer, a rectifying behavior with a large rectification ratio (>105) was observed. So, we used multilayer flakes (GaTe = 13 nm & HfSe2 = 17 nm) for optoelectronic applications. As the thickness of TMD materials is deceased, the tunneling current is increased from the interface of the GaTe/HfSe2 photodiode.28,36,39 The tunneling mechanism is suppressed in the thick devices and rectification is enhanced. The RR could be enhanced in the thick GaTe and HfSe2 based devices.25,38 In p-GaTe and p-HfSe2, the bandgap (electron affinity) lies in the range of 1.7 eV (3.2 eV) and 1.1 eV (4.35 eV), respectively.16,17,19,40 The electrons in huge numbers are moved from HfSe2 to GaTe during forward biasing.
Finally, we observed a large If. In contrast to this, the transport of electrons was suppressed due to the large potential barrier in the reverse biasing. The Vbg has also modulated the charge carriers in the diode. The electric field stimulated the charge carrier density in HfSe2 at Vbg = +40 V and it also reduces the barrier and as a result huge If and Ir currents flow through the p-GaTe/n-HfSe2 heterostructure.39 At Vbg = −40 V, the Fermi-level shifts towards the valence band that causes suppression of the reverse/leakage current and RR is amplified. Thus, this electrostatic modulation of the charge carrier transport provides a platform to design high performance and fast switching devices.
Photovoltaic measurements
The GaTe/HfSe2 photodiode is exposed under the laser light (λ = 532 nm) to extract the photovoltaic key parameters. Fig. 6(a) shows that the photocurrent–voltage (Iph–Vds) features are measured under the laser illumination at a constant Vbg = 0 V with different powers of 20–100 μW. As the power of laser light is increased from 20 μW to 100 μW, the photocurrent is continuously increased linearly. The irradiated light generates more electron–hole (e–h) pairs that increase the reverse and forward currents.28,41 The excess e–h pairs are alienated at the interface because of the build-in electric field.42,43 The improved values of the short-circuit current (Isc = 3.41 μA) and the open-circuit voltage (Voc ≈ 0.49 V) are perceived with the incident light with a power of 100 μW. As the power of the incident laser is increased, the e–h pair generation is also enhanced. Basically, the incident photon has more energy that generates more e–h pairs at the interface. To estimate the photoresponse of the photodiode, time-dependent photoresponse is measured (Fig. 6(b)). For the rise and decay times, the temporal curves are fitted by using the following equations,  and , respectively. Fast rise and decay times  are perceived as shown in Fig. 6(c and d).44–46

(e) The responsivity of the device is based on the GaTe/HfSe2 vdW heterostructure under various powers of incident laser light. (f) The comparison of the obtained responsivity with other recently reported results for different heterojunctions. 
The photoresponsivity R of the GaTe/HfSe2 photodiode device is estimated as R = Iph/PA,47,48 where Iph is the current under illumination, and A denotes the channel area of the GaTe/HfSe2 heterostructure. The extraordinary value of R of the presented device is observed as  at 20 μW (Fig. 6(e)). The responsivity values obtained in this work are much higher as compared to the recently reported values by several research groups (Fig. 6(f)).49–52 We also calculated the maximum photoelectric conversion efficiency (Pel = Ids × Vds) of the GaTe/HfSe2 vdW heterostructure photodiode (Fig. S6, ESI†) at different powers.53,54
Furthermore, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) is also determined by using a formula given as , where λ, h and c indicate the wavelength, Planck's constant, and the speed of light, respectively. The obtained value of EQE is 54% in the GaTe/HfSe2 vdW heterostructure photodiode. Therefore, the enhanced value of photoresponsivity and EQE are accredited to the excellent ohmic contacts, sharp interface and direct bandgap nature of HfSe2. The presented heterostructure of p-GaTe/n-HfSe2 might be useful in improving the photovoltaic characteristics and its applications in solar cells.
Conclusions
In this research, a novel and unique p-type GaTe/n-type HfSe2 vdW heterostructure photodiode is reported. A large RR of 6.3 × 105 is extracted at negative Vbg because of the low resistive electrodes and the clean interface between GaTe/HfSe2 vdW heterostructure photodiodes, and is much higher than that of the previously reported TMD based vdW heterostructures. The photovoltaic parameters of the GaTe/HfSe2 photodiode are inspected at various intensities of incident lights as 20–100 μW. The improved values of Voc = 0.49 V and Isc = 3.41 μA are achieved under the incident laser light with an intensity of 100 μW. Fast λ1 (18 μs) and λ2 (24 μs) values are attained under a laser light of power 100 μW. The extraordinary R () and EQE (54%) are achieved in the GaTe/HfSe2 heterostructure photodiode. The TMD vdW heterostructures are imperative for electronics and optoelectronics to design high-performance and efficient energy harvesting devices.
Device fabrication
The flakes of TMDs n-HfSe2 and p-GaTe were exfoliated with standard Scotch tape. To make the heterostructure, the HfSe2 nano-flake with suitable thickness is transferred on GaTe by the dry transfer method. First, the thickness of HfSe2 and GaTe is confirmed by the interference effect. The flakes were annealed to remove the residue and enhance the charge carrier density. The PDMS stamp that accommodates the p-GaTe flake with a thickness of a few nanometers was shifted onto the HfSe2 flake with a micro-aligner stage. The source and drain contacts were fabricated using the state-of-the-art electron-beam lithography (EBL) process to measure the electrical and optical characteristics. For metallization, the thermal evaporation system was used. For the lift-off process, acetone was used. The area of the p-GaTe/n-HfSe2 heterojunction is 15 μm × 20 μm.
Device characterization and transport measurement
All electrical and photovoltaic characteristics are measured in a vacuum box with Keithley-2400 and Keithley-6485. The photovoltaic measurements were performed using laser light with wavelength λ = 532 nm. To examine the structural characteristic of p-GaTe and n-HfSe2 by Raman spectroscopy, a micro Raman system (Renishaw, InVia systems) having a laser beam of wavelength λ = 514.5 nm (argon ion) was used under ambient conditions. The power and the spot size of wavelengths were fixed at P ≈ 1.0 mW and λ ≈ 1 μm respectively to protect the device from local heating. To determine the precise thickness and the surface morphology of TMD nanoflakes, a commercial atomic force microscope (AFM) (XE-100 by Park systems Inc.) was utilized in the contact mode.
