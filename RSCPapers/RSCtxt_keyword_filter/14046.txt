    , Accepted 5th November 2019First published on 11th November 2019AbstractOrganic molecular hole-transport materials (HTMs) are appealing for the scalable manufacture of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) because they are easier to reproducibly prepare in high purity than polymeric and inorganic HTMs. There is also a need to construct PSCs without dopants and additives to avoid formidable engineering and stability issues. We report here a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.6% with a molecular HTM in an inverted (p–i–n) PSC without any dopants or interlayers. This new benchmark was made possible by the discovery that, upon annealing, a spiro-based dopant-free HTM (denoted DFH) containing redox-active triphenyl amine (TPA) units undergoes preferential molecular organization normal to the substrate. This structural order, governed by the strong intermolecular interactions of the DFH dioxane groups, affords high intrinsic hole mobility (1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). Annealing films of DFH also enables the growth of large perovskite grains (up to 2 μm) that minimize charge recombination in the PSC. DFH can also be isolated at a fraction of the cost of any other organic HTM.

Broader context
Hole transport materials (HTMs) are critical to the function of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Organic molecular HTMs are generally easier to reproducibly prepare in high purity than polymeric and inorganic HTMs. A key challenge with organic molecular HTMs, however, is that they usually require dopants to reach the high conductivities necessary for high device power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). These dopants, which can attract moisture and can migrate during device operation, can adversely affect the long-term performance of the PSC. These collective factors have inspired the design of dopant-free organic molecular HTMs. In this study, we report a rare example of such a material, which we named DFH, that is capable of hitting a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of >20% in the PSC. Importantly, DFH can be obtained in 2 synthetic steps and at a materials cost of merely 3 USD per g. This material is order(s) of magnitude cheaper than all other reported organic HTMs that produce high PCEs in PSCs. These results highlight the importance of making high-performance HTMs that are compatible with commercial manufacturing.

Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) rely on hole-transport materials (HTMs) to efficiently extract holes from the perovskite layer and minimize charge recombination at the anode.1–4 A wide range of inorganic metal oxides,5 organic π-conjugated polymers6 and organic small molecules7 have proven to be effective HTMs in the PSC (Fig. 1). Organic small molecules are particularly appealing because they offer acute control of physicochemical properties, and are relatively easy to synthesize, purify, and process.7–9 Moreover, the hole transport layer of the state-of-the-art PSC is based on organic small molecules.10
 Fig. 1  Benchmark PCEs for devices containing organic HTMs with and without dopants. DFH can be synthesized at a fraction of the cost of the other HTMs and does not require interlayers (P3HT requires interlayers to reach 20%). The champion PSC device with an inorganic HTM is 20.6% (not listed). 
A key challenge with molecular HTMs is that they usually require dopants to reach the high conductivities necessary for high device power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).10–12 Dopants can compromise device performance by accelerating deleterious moisture permeation, ion migration, and interfacial charge recombination during device operation.12–16 This situation can be addressed in part with barrier layers,17,18 but a simpler solution is to design HTMs that do not require dopants. This has prompted the design of dopant-free molecular HTMs consisting of large planar π-stacked19–22 or π-conjugated donor–acceptor molecules.23–26 While dopant-free polymeric HTMs have yielded PCEs as high as 22.7% in devices containing additional interlayers,27 these interlayers complicate the device fabrication process and can reduce the thermal stability of the cell.10 Molecular HTMs have not previously reached the 20% PCE threshold without the use of dopants.19,28–30
We report herein a new benchmark for dopant-free molecular HTMs by showing that devices containing N2,N2,N7,N7-tetra-p-tolylspiro[fluorene-9,2′-[1,3]dioxolane]-2,7-diamine (DFH) as the HTM can yield a PCE of 20.6% (Fig. 1 and 2a).30 This breakthrough was realized in an inverted PSC architecture without the assistance of p-dopants or interlayers, and made possible by designing DFH: (i) with an appropriately positioned HOMO energy for efficient charge extraction from the perovskite layer; and (ii) with functional groups that encourage anisotropic molecular ordering of the film to mediate high electronic conductivity and hole mobility normal to the perovskite layer. This layer also accommodates the growth of large crystalline domains for the perovskite layer (Fig. 2b). Moreover, this rationally designed DFH can be isolated by the reaction of inexpensive reagents followed by a facile purification process that could enable it to be scaled at a cost of ∼$3 g−1 (Tables S1 and S2, ESI†). These economics, which cannot be matched by any champion organic HTM (Fig. 1), compare favorably to the inexpensive sol–gel chemistry used to make inorganic HTMs.31,32 This feature is important because molecular organic HTMs are viewed to be generally easier to scale since they do not suffer from the same batch-to-batch variability as inorganic and polymeric HTMs.33,34

The structure of DFH features two fluorene-bridged triphenylamine (TPA) moieties linked to a 1,3-dioxolane group through a spiro carbon center (Fig. 1). The HTM is formed through a successive Buchwald–Hartwig amination of 2,7-dibromo-9-fluorenone and acid-catalyzed condensation with ethylene glycol. Products from each reaction can be purified by recrystallization rather than column chromatography to yield DFH in 73% overall reaction yield.8 The design of DFH was inspired by the knowledge that spiro-type HTMs exhibit low redox reorganization energies, high glass transition temperatures (Tg) and good morphological stabilities.35–40 The two TPA groups were positioned across the fluorene bridge to mediate strong electronic coupling between the two redox-active units (Fig. S4, ESI†). This strong electronic coupling leads to a 0.32 V difference between the first and second TPA+˙/TPA reduction potentials and raises the HOMO energy to −5.27 eV. This value that maintains a high cell voltage while still accommodating hole extraction from the perovskite with a valence band maximum of −5.4 eV.41 The high LUMO energy of −2.29 eV preserves a large optical band gap of 2.98 eV to avoid the undesirable absorption of visible light (Fig. S4, ESI†).
A powerful feature of DFH is the propensity for the molecules, upon annealing, to dimerize and preferentially order orthogonal to the substrate, but without additional long-range order in the film. This molecular ordering therefore presents the opportunity to balance the need to provide sufficient structural order for charge transport,42–44 while avoiding the formation of large crystalline domains that introduce cracks or pinholes and impair interfacial electronic contacts.45,46 This axial growth of DFH is largely a consequence of the cyclic, polar 1,3-dioxolane group (Fig. 3a) facilitating strong intermolecular interactions to form tightly bound dimers of DFH. A single-crystal structure determination of DFH confirms these intermolecular C–H⋯O and C–H⋯π interactions between the dioxane groups on neighboring DFH molecules parallel to the b-axis (Fig. 3b and Fig. S5, S6, ESI†). The strengths of these intermolecular interactions are calculated to be as strong as 110 kJ mol−1 per pair of DFH (ESI). Amorphous DFH transforms into paracrystalline dimers when DFH is heated above the glass transition temperature (Tg) of ∼120 °C (Fig. 3c). Slow crystallization occurs at higher annealing temperatures below the onset temperature of cold-crystallization (Tcc) of 160 °C where heterogeneous nucleation becomes operative. Solid-state NMR spectroscopic experiments were employed to track the chemical environment about the carbon atoms of DFH upon heating. It is evident that heating amorphous DFH to 120 °C causes the ethylene 13C resonance of the 1,3-dioxane group to sharpen towards a full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) approaching that of the crystalline material (Fig. 3d, Fig. S9 and S10, ESI†), and the sharpening of the peaks corresponding to crystallization occurs at much higher temperatures.

(e) Powder XRD diffractograms of DFH before and after thermal crystallization (black) and GIXD traces of 150 nm spin-coated DFH thin films before and after annealing at 150 °C (blue). 
Powder XRD data recorded upon heating amorphous DFH confirms that crystallization begins to occur at 120 °C, and that higher temperatures yield progressively sharper reflections (Fig. 3e). We then performed 2θ scans on a 150 nm thin film of DFH using parallel-beam grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) and observed the onset of only a single peak upon annealing to 150 °C, which is assigned to diffraction signal of the (010) crystallographic planes (Fig. S7, ESI†). This peak at low 2θ points to the preferential ordering of DFH normal to the plane of the substrate and along the direction of dimerization, with the broad baseline indicating a lack of long-range order for the balance of the film.
An important outcome of the paracrystalline ordering of DFH molecules is that the redox-active TPA groups are drawn close to each other without the growth of large crystals. We infer that this feature is responsible for the high hole mobilities (μh) of ∼1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the amorphous and annealed films of DFH measured normal to the plane of the substrate. These values are comparable to single-crystal Spiro-OMeTAD,42 and are greater than those of the previous state-of-the-art dopant-free molecular HTM20 and heavily p-doped thin films of spiro-OMeTAD.39,47 The electric conductivity of DFH thin films also doubled upon annealing (Table S5, ESI†). Another notable observation is that we were able to grow pinhole-free perovskite thin-films with large grain sizes (Fig. S14, average 0.6 μm2, ESI†) on layers of DFH annealed at 135 °C, while smaller grains were observed with other DFH layers (Fig. S15, ESI†). Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) of the perovskite layer showed a slightly higher tendency of out-of-plane growth on DFH annealed at 135 °C, compared to as-prepared and DFH annealed at 120 °C (Fig. S16, ESI†). It is possible that a low degree of DFH crystallization at 135 °C is critical for the growth of large perovskite grains whereas its impact on perovskite crystal orientation is relatively small.
This combination of high axial μh for DFH and large grain sizes of the light-absorbing layer provides the ideal conditions for high PSC performance. We therefore tested DFH in a planar inverted (p–i–n) PSC with an ITO|DFH|perovskite|C60|BCP|Ag configuration (where ITO = indium-doped tin oxide; perovskite = MA0.9FA0.1PbI3−xClx; BCP = bathocuproine). A mixed methylammonium/formamidinium perovskite was deposited onto spin-coated DFH layers using established methods.48 Devices containing as-prepared DFH generated PCE values of merely 10%. This output was increased up to 20.6% when the DFH films were annealed at 135 °C (Fig. 4a). This PCE represents the highest value ever reported for a dopant-free molecular HTM, and the highest value for a device with any dopant-free HTM without interlayers. This PCE also compared favorably to the PCEs that we were able to produce in optimized devices containing the champion dopant-free polymeric HTM, poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA; Table 1 and Fig. S11, ESI†).9

The PSC efficiency was doubled by annealing amorphous DFH films to temperatures between Tg and Tcc to encourage dimerization and a small degree of crystallization. The best devices we tested were those where DFH was annealed at 135 °C (Fig. 4a). An annealed DFH film quenched >95% of the baseline photoluminescence of the perovskite, indicating a band alignment that enables effective extraction of holes from the perovskite layer (Fig. 4b). The temporal resolution of the perovskite photoluminescence shows that 99% of holes are extracted within 20 ns by annealed DFH (Fig. 4c). The same set of steady-state and kinetic experiments recorded with amorphous DFH films showed relatively inferior hole extraction properties: ∼60% quenching of steady state photoluminescence and >40 ns to extract 99% of holes. We assume that the large defect-free grain sizes play a critical role in mitigating ohmic losses and producing the high measured fill factor (FF) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) values.19,41,49–51
Conclusions
We have demonstrated that a molecular organic HTM with redox-active TPA groups yields electronic properties conducive to high performance in an inverted PSC without the need for dopants. The ability to produce a PCE > 20% with a synthetically accessible HTM and a simple device structure (i.e., no interlayers or barrier layers) offers the opportunity for scalable manufacturing. This record device performance for a dopant-free molecular HTM is a result of the molecular organization of HTM molecules with carefully tailored energy levels, as well as the large grain sizes of the perovskite layer grown on the HTM. This work also shows how thermal annealing of HTMs capable of supramolecular interactions can also affect the quality of the perovskite layers to further drive up device performance. The success with DFH also challenges the accepted dogma that dopant-free HTMs need to exhibit large, planar π-stacking structures or complex donor–acceptor moieties.

Broader context
Hole transport materials (HTMs) are critical to the function of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Organic molecular HTMs are generally easier to reproducibly prepare in high purity than polymeric and inorganic HTMs. A key challenge with organic molecular HTMs, however, is that they usually require dopants to reach the high conductivities necessary for high device power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). These dopants, which can attract moisture and can migrate during device operation, can adversely affect the long-term performance of the PSC. These collective factors have inspired the design of dopant-free organic molecular HTMs. In this study, we report a rare example of such a material, which we named DFH, that is capable of hitting a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of >20% in the PSC. Importantly, DFH can be obtained in 2 synthetic steps and at a materials cost of merely 3 USD per g. This material is order(s) of magnitude cheaper than all other reported organic HTMs that produce high PCEs in PSCs. These results highlight the importance of making high-performance HTMs that are compatible with commercial manufacturing.


 	Fig. 1  Benchmark PCEs for devices containing organic HTMs with and without dopants. DFH can be synthesized at a fraction of the cost of the other HTMs and does not require interlayers (P3HT requires interlayers to reach 20%). The champion PSC device with an inorganic HTM is 20.6% (not listed).	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Current–voltage traces of the champion device in the forward and reverse directions (scan rate = 160 mV s−1). (b) Cross-sectional scanning electron microscope images of an inverted (p–i–n) PSC containing DFH as the HTM (ITO = indium tin oxide; BCP = bathocuproine).	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Molecular structure of DFH with the ethylene and spiro carbon atoms of the cyclic 1,3-dioxolane group highlighted in red and blue, respectively. (b) The propensity of CH⋯O interactions between DFH molecules illustrated by a ball-and-stick model derived from the X-ray crystallographic data. The spiro carbon and carbon atoms on the ethylene group are highlighted in blue and red, respectively. (c) Differential scanning calorimetry data of amorphous DFH powder obtained at a scan rate of 10 K min−1. (d) Measured solid-state NMR peak width of selected carbon atoms in terms of FWHM of amorphous and annealed DFH solids. (e) Powder XRD diffractograms of DFH before and after thermal crystallization (black) and GIXD traces of 150 nm spin-coated DFH thin films before and after annealing at 150 °C (blue).	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) J–V curves of PSCs based on DFH hole transport layer annealed at different temperatures. (b) Steady-state fluorescence quenching of perovskite thin films by the underlying DFH layers; (c) fluorescence decay kinetics of PMMA encapsulated perovskite thin films on different DFH thin films illuminated by a 553 nm laser.
