    , Accepted 1st April 2022First published on 6th April 2022AbstractInefficient minority carrier extraction and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics are two principal contradictions restricting photoelectrochemical water oxidation. Here, the aforementioned restrictions could be simultaneously alleviated by coupling ultrathin black phosphorus (BP) nanosheets, taking the monoclinic WO3 nanoflake array as a prototype. Derived from the unequal work functions, a large built-in electric field was formed, and the surface hole extraction efficiency was improved from 41.7 to 70.9% at 1.23 V. The efficient carrier exchange, in turn, inhibited self-oxidation of the exfoliated BP nanosheets and resulted in fine durability during the 12 h of stability testing. Moreover, density functional theory calculations revealed that coordinatively unsaturated phosphorus atoms intensified affinity to O species intermediates and lowered the activation energy, thereby reducing the OER overpotential. Consequently, a low onset potential of 0.21 V and a high photocurrent density of 1.88 mA cm−2 were achieved. This work paves a way to rationally design the harmonious coexistence of BP-based electrocatalysts and photoanodes to achieve enhanced solar energy conversion.
1. Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting technology delivers a environmentally friendly carbon-free method to convert renewable solar energy into hydrogen under mild conditions.1 However, the developed PEC water splitting systems remain far below the requirements for practical application due to their unsatisfactory photocurrent density and energy conversion efficiency. The fatal problems are that the slow migration dynamics and surface recombination of minority carriers (photo-induced holes for n type semiconductors) initially reduce the driving force for PEC water splitting.2–4 Furthermore, the surface oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is deemed as the rate-determining step and governs the overall efficiency of water splitting. It is plagued by sluggish water oxidation kinetics due to the inefficiency of multi-proton-coupled electron transfer.5 Therefore, improving the photoinduced hole extractions and OER reaction kinetics is the fundamental precondition for extending PEC water splitting technology toward upscaling and commercialization.
Recently, emphasis has been placed on developing the ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) materials with thicknesses that retain only a single- or few-atom layer.6–9 As a cutting-edge and novel 2D family of materials, exfoliated black phosphorus (BP) nanosheets are considered a promising structural motif for solar energy conversion, benefitting from excellent electrical and optical properties.6,7 Essentially, the BP nanosheets consist of wrinkled layers of phosphorus that are linked by an interlayer of weak van der Waals forces with a honeycomb network unit and sp2-hybridized orbitals, which consequently induces extremely low carrier effective mass, fast hole mobility of up to 103–104 cm2 V−1 s−1, and large in-plane anisotropy, like graphene.8,9 Bearing this in mind, the aforementioned advantages and intrinsic lone pairs are instrumental in proton-coupled electron transfer, which enables BP nanosheets for use as a potential electrocatalyst for water splitting. Moreover, overcoming the failings of graphene, such as its zero band gap, can be easily achieved in BP by regulating the number of layers, indicating the wide light absorption across the ultraviolet and near-infrared regions.10,11 The semiconducting BP nanosheets not only hold direct band gap properties but also maintain their unique advantages such as huge surface-to-volume ratio and abundant active sites, which are perfectly profitable for photocatalysis energy conversion. The aforementioned merits theoretically endow the ultrathin BP nanosheets with the potential of heterojunction and OER cocatalysts.
Herein, we highlight that the ultrathin BP nanosheet can serve as a heterojunction and an OER cocatalyst and efficiently improve PEC performance in solar water oxidation, taking the monoclinic WO3 nanoflake array, with a narrow band gap and a large specific surface area, as a prototype. Benefitting from the great interface affinity between WO3 and BP, the resultant heterojunction interface produced a built-in electric field and efficiently extracted the photogenerated holes, as confirmed by systematic experimental and computational evidence. Moreover, the coordinatively unsaturated sites on the surface of the ultrathin BP nanosheets significantly improved the OER kinetics by efficiently bonding to O species intermediates, thereby improving the potential limiting step. Consequently, a negative shift of 0.51 V on the onset potential was achieved, and a plateau photocurrent density of 1.88 mA cm−2 was recorded at the champion photoanode, which was 2.8 times higher than that of unmodified WO3. Significantly, compared with the reported BP-based photocatalysts, no distinct decays of PEC performances were observed during the 12 h illumination experiment, demonstrating that the rational design of BP electrocatalysts and semiconductor photoanodes is a promising method for solar to fuel conversion.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of BP@WO3 photoanodes
The monoclinic WO3 nanoflake array photoanodes were prepared based on the work of Su.12 Bulk BP crystals were exfoliated by continuous ultrasonic treatment in absolute alcohol. Typically, a given number of 50 mg primordial BP crystals was transferred into 100 mL absolute alcohol, following flowing N2 for 30 min to eliminate the dissolved oxygen. Then, this mixture was sonicated for 12 h under 80 W ultrasonic power and the system temperature was maintained at 10 °C through circulating water. The resultant dispersions were initially separated by 2000 rpm centrifugation for 15 min to remove the massive BP crystals. Then a higher revolution of 16000 rpm was used to obtain the ultrathin BP nanosheet dispersion. The as-prepared WO3 photoelectrode was immersed in the exfoliated BP nanosheet dispersions for 24 h. After soaking, all BP@WO3 photoanodes were dried with flowing nitrogen gas.
The obtained composite photoanode is denoted as BP@WO3.
2.2 Characterization
The crystal structure was characterized using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) using a D8 Advance instrument (Bruker). The surface morphology information was detected by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (JEOL, JSM-7001f). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained by using JEOL JEM 2100plus equipment. The height profiles of the exfoliated BP nanosheets were detected using an atomic force microscopy (AFM) device (Asylum Research, MFP-30). The surface electronic information was acquired from the X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, ESCALAB 250 Xi), using a carbon 1s binding energy of 284.8 eV as a reference. Raman spectroscopy was carried out using a Thermo Fisher DRX instrument. UV/Vis absorption was analyzed using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV2450). Surface photovoltage spectra (SPS) were recorded using a CEL-SPS1000 surface photovoltage spectrum apparatus equipped with monochromatic light supported by an electronic chopper (SBP 300), under a frequency range of 20–70 Hz.
2.3 PEC measurements
The PEC performances were evaluated using CH Instruments (760e), and a typical three-electrode electrochemical cell was used. The obtained sample, Ag/AgCl (soaked in 3 M KCl solution) and a platinum electrode served as the working electrode, the reference electrode, and the counter electrode, respectively. The intensity of simulated sunlight illuminating the electrode surface was regulated to 100 mW cm−2, and all the obtained photoelectrodes were front-side illuminated, with 0.5 M Na2SO4 (pH = 6.85) as the electrolyte. The current–potential curves were recorded at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The applied potentials vs. the Ag/AgCl electrode were sampled to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to eqn (1): φRHE = φAg/AgCl + 0.059 × pH + 0.197 (V),(1)where φRHE and φAg/AgCl refer to the RHE and installed external potential. Unless otherwise specified, all applied bias voltages were converted into reversible hydrogen electrode potentials. The pH herein was valued at 6.85. Applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) was obtained using eqn (2): ABPE (%) = 100% × j × (1.23 V − φ)/Plight,(2)where j is the monitored photocurrent density and Plight is 100 mW cm−2. The surface charge separation efficiency (ηsur) was obtained using eqn (3): ηsur (%) = 100% × j(Na2SO4)/j(hole scavenger),(3)where j(Na2SO4) (mA cm−2) and j(hole scavenger) (mA cm−2) were the current density in 0.5 M Na2SO4 and Na2SO3 solution as a hole scavenger, respectively. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed under open-circuit voltage following a frequency range of 105–10−2 Hz under radiation, and the resulting fitting was quantified using ZSIMPWIN software. Monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency values were obtained using eqn (4): IPCE (%) = 1240 × jmono/Pmonoλ,(4)where λ (nm) refers to the incident light wavelength, and jmono (mA cm−2) is the monitored current density, and Pmono (mW cm−2) refers to the measured irradiance.
2.4 Computational details
All calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT) were performed using the plane-wave basis sets in the VASP.13 The electronic correlation and pseudo-potential were expressed with Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) within generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and the projected-augmented wave (PAW) method.14,15 A 1 × 2 × 2 supercell of monoclinic WO3 including 64 atoms was constructed and a vacuum length of 25 Å along the z-direction was set to eliminate the interactions between mirror images. The Brillouin zone was analyzed using 1 × 1 × 1 for bulk geometry optimization and 3 × 3 × 1 Gamma centre grid for static self-consistency. An energy cut-off of 550 eV was adopted. The convergence criteria for geometry optimization and static self-consistent computation were 0.02 eV Å−3 and 1 × 10−5 eV, and following that the DFT + D2 algorithm was used to describe the vdW corrections of Grimme.16 Gibbs free energy changes for related intermediates in the OER process in the neutral medium were computed as eqn (5)–(9): ΔEM*OH = EM*OH − EM – [EH2O – 0.5 × EH2],(5) ΔEM*O = EM*O − EM – [EH2O – EH2],(6) ΔEM*OOH = EM*OOH − EM – [2 × EH2O – 1.5 × EH2].(7)
The EM, EM*OH, EM*O, and EM*OOH refer to the energy of the slab, M*O, M*OH, and M*OOH, respectively, and the * stands for adsorption. EH2O and EH2 denote gaseous free H2O and H2 energy, respectively. Gibbs free energy was found using eqn (8) and (9): ΔGi = ΔEi + (ΔZPE)i − Δ(TS)i (i = 1, 2, 3),(8) ΔG4 = 4.92 eV − ΔG3 − ΔG2 − ΔG1,(9)where the ΔEi (i = 1, 2, 3) refers to the calculated energy from eqn (5)–(7), respectively, and the ZPE and TS refer to the vibration frequency calculated by VASP. The theoretical overpotential (η) could then be deducted using eqn (10). η (V) = Max[ΔG1, ΔG2, ΔG3, ΔG4]/e – 1.23 V,(10)where Max [ΔG1, ΔG2, ΔG3, ΔG4] is the maximum Gibbs free energy change over four intermediate reactions.
The work function is defined as: Φ = Evac − Ef,(11)wherein Evac and Ef refer to the energy of a stationary electron in the vacuum near the surface and Fermi level, respectively, and are calculated by VASP.
3. Results and discussion
Surface morphology observations are presented in Fig. 1(a) and (b). The well-aligned WO3 nanoflakes grow on the FTO substrate. The nanoflake arrays are beneficial for diminishing light reflection and provide a large specific surface area for charge transfer. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the exfoliated BP nanosheets are deposited on WO3 nanoflakes via natural adsorption during soaking WO3 in a BP dispersion. Moreover, the most transparent structure of BP nanosheets implied that an ultrathin layer was obtained. Furthermore, the AFM profile in Fig. 1(c) indicates that the exfoliated BP nanosheet displayed an obvious 2D morphology with an average thickness of ∼0.98 nm, corresponding to the 2-layer slab thickness.17 The ultrathin structure endows the BP nanosheet with not only abundant coordinatively unsaturated sites but also intensified surface energy.18 Moreover, the crystalline phases of the obtained WO3 nanosheet arrays and the bulk BP crystal are monoclinic and orthorhombic, as evidenced by XRD in Fig. S1.† Within this context, the exfoliated BP nanosheets spontaneously combine with WO3 nanoflakes, and the coordinatively unsaturated phosphorus atom potentially plays an imperative role in regulating multiple electron–proton coupling processes during the OER loop. Fig. 1(d) shows that the obtained BP nanosheets adhere to WO3. The TEM and HRTEM images of the single WO3 and BP nanosheet are shown in Fig. S2.† As displayed in Fig. 1(e), the HRTEM image reveals that the distinct fringe spacing of 0.36 nm and the interplanar spacing of around 0.52 nm can be attributed to the WO3 (200) and BP (020) planes, respectively. It is worth noting that the white dotted area in Fig. 1(e) shows distinct lattice distortion, suggesting that the atoms in the interface region receive some impact derived from an interface built-in electric field – namely, the heterostructure may be formed. Raman spectroscopy was further utilized to detect the composition of the as-prepared photoelectrodes. As shown in Fig. 1(f), the Raman peaks at 130 and 180 cm−1 indicate (W2O2)n chains.19 Moreover, the peaks emerging at 274 and 328 cm−1 can be ascribed to the W–O–W bending modes,20 while the peak positions of 716 and 805 cm−1 signify the W–O–W stretching mode of the lattice network.21 Compared with the bare WO3, the slight Raman signals with respect to 358, 432, and 453 cm−1 can be classified as Ag1 (out-of-plane), B2g (in-plane), and Ag2 (in-plane) phonon modes of the BP, respectively.22

XPS analysis was carried out to reveal the surface chemical composition. As presented in Fig. 2(a), when compared with WO3, the W 4f peaks of BP@WO3 showed positive shifts of 0.36 and 0.37 eV, indicating the decrease of electron density around the W atoms after the introduction of the BP nanosheets.23Fig. 2(b) shows that the O 1s peak of BP@WO3 positively shifts to 0.53 eV, implying that the O atoms catch electrons from the phosphorus atoms.24 The interactions between WO3 and the BP layers potentially build an interface electric field, which is crucial for the interface charge separation.25Fig. 2(c) displays the P 2p core-level spectrum, where the fitted two peaks associated with 131.0 and 129.8 eV can be ascribed to P 2p 1/2 and 2p 3/2, respectively, corresponding to the P0 species.26 In addition, the P content was found to be 1.46% based on the XPS analysis.

The PEC performances were initially evaluated by the j–V curves. As outlined in Fig. 3(a), the bare WO3 photoanode yields a photocurrent density of 0.49 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V, which is inferior to the theoretical maximum. Upon coupling of the ultrathin BP nanosheets, remarkably, the current density was increased to 1.88 mA cm−2, which is 3.84 times as great as that of the WO3 photoanode. Notably, a negative shift of 0.51 V over the onset potential was achieved, suggesting that the ultrathin BP nanosheets significantly improved sluggish water oxidation kinetics and reduced the thermodynamic barrier of the OER. The current density was rapidly intensified at 0.6 to 1.2 V, which demonstrated a remarkable fill factor of the BP@WO3 photoanode. Furthermore, the seven cycles of chopped transient response measurements also demonstrated an approximate 3-fold enhancement in the photocurrent density, as shown in Fig. 3(b). Fig. 3(c) displays the half-cell ABPEs of the bare WO3 and BP@WO3 photoelectrode. The maximum ABPE values were calculated as 0.04% and 0.27% based on the j–V curves, respectively. The surface charge separation efficiency was measured in 0.5 M Na2SO3 as a hole scavenger. As shown in Fig. 3(d), the ηsur values of BP@WO3 are significantly higher than those of the bare WO3, demonstrating that the coupling of ultrathin BP nanosheets greatly improves the surface charge separation process. Furthermore, the IPCE plots were generated to estimate the external quantum efficiency. As illustrated in Fig. 3(e), the as-prepared samples all show an active IPCE value up to 460 nm, which matches with the optical absorption range of the monoclinic WO3 photocatalyst. As expected, BP@WO3 showed a maximum IPCE value of 26.55% at 340 nm, whereas WO3 presented a value of 8.82% at 360 nm, meaning that the ultrathin BP nanosheets were effective activators for solar energy conversion. Fig. 3(f) shows the long-term stability measurement of the BP@WO3 composite photoanode. After the 12 h light illumination experiment, the observed photocurrent density (1.58 mA cm−2) remained at 94.8% of the initial value (1.62 mA cm−2), indicating that the as-prepared BP@WO3 composite photoelectrode is an excellent candidate for PEC water splitting.

The UV/Vis absorption spectra (Fig. 4(a)) show that the absorption edge of the bare WO3 is 460 nm, relating to the band gap of 2.70 eV and matching the reported monoclinic WO3 photoanode. The light response was enhanced upon coupling of the BP nanosheets, especially in the visible light region. The enhanced light absorption can be attributed to the fact that the p-type BP possesses a small band gap.27 To reveal the interface charge transfer kinetics, the EIS spectra were measured, as shown in Fig. 4(b). In the analogous circuit, Rs, Rct, and CPE indicate the charge transfer resistance in the WO3 bulk, charge transfer resistance in the semiconductor/electrolyte, and the constant phase angle element, respectively.28 The fitted Rct values of the WO3 and BP@WO3 films are 3891 and 1266 Ω, respectively, indicating that charge migrations suffer from a larger resistance at the WO3/electrolyte interface than at the BP nanosheet/electrolyte interface. It can be deduced that the electron transfer resistance across the catalyst/electrolyte interface was reduced by the coupling of the ultrathin BP nanosheets, thereby boosting the PEC performances. Furthermore, the SPS technology was employed to determine the minority carrier diffusion behaviours. As displayed in Fig. 4(c), the bare WO3 exhibits a negligible photovoltage signal under ultraviolet and visible light irradiation, and suffers from serious bulk and surface recombination. However, BP@WO3 presented a higher photovoltage response in the UV region, indicating that the ultrathin BP nanosheets were instrumental in hole extraction. Because the SPS signal is intrinsically derived from the separated carriers, a higher SPS response means a higher concentration of photogenerated holes on the surface for the WO3 photoanode.29

The work function of the material is an essential indicator to evaluate the capability of gains and losses of electrons. The electrostatic potential profiles for WO3 and BP nanosheets are shown in Fig. 5. The calculated Φ value (4.49 eV) of the BP nanosheet is lower than that of WO3 (7.68 eV), indicating that the electrons flowed from BP to WO3 until the ground state formed. Consequently, the accumulated negative and positive net charges induced an interface electric field. This electric field is crucial for driving the interface electron and hole separation and thus governs the photocatalytic performance of the heterostructure.

To further shed light on the interfacial charge distribution, the charge density difference was utilized to simulate the BP@WO3 heterojunction interface. As shown in Fig. 6(a), the electronic localization and confinement region are visible in the interface, indicating that the electrons flow from WO3 to BP until electrostatic balance. The charge redistributions of the BP@WO3 interfaces were quantitatively revealed by the planar-averaged charge density difference in the ground state, as shown in Fig. 6(b). Owing to the charge redistribution in the interface, a built-in electric field with the direction from WO3 to BP was generated, which was crucial for overcoming the potential energy barriers and accelerating hole extraction.30Fig. 6(c) shows the optimized geometrical structure of the OER reaction intermediates terminated on the catalyst surface and the corresponding differential charge density map. The bond lengths of the pivotal intermediates (*OH, *O and *OOH) bonding with the host material atoms in the BP@WO3 case were all shorter than those of the WO3 counterparts, indicating that the coordinatively unsaturated phosphorus atoms intensified affinity to O species intermediates and thus tuned the OER process.31 Upon confirming the geometric models in the OER process, it was possible to evaluate the Gibbs free energy based on that. The elementary steps for the OER in the neutral medium are confirmed as shown in Fig. 6(d). The OER rate-determining step of the bare WO3 primarily originates from the dissociation of water molecules to the OH group on the surface, suffering from the low efficiency of the proton-coupled electron transfer process due to the few unsaturated catalytic sites. As for BP@WO3, the rate-determining step is determined by the emerging O–P–O configuration, as evidenced by the geometrical structure in Fig. 6(c). The overpotential (η) was decreased from 0.89 to 0.6 V, indicating that the rate-determining step of the OER was significantly improved and thus led to enhanced solar water oxidation.

4. Conclusions
In summary, the ultra-thin BP nanosheet coupled with WO3 nanoflake array heterojunction photoelectrodes were synthesized via a facile natural adsorption method. The built-in electric field of the heterojunction significantly accelerated the hole extraction and overcame the potential energy barriers. Moreover, the coordinatively unsaturated phosphorus atoms intensified affinity to O species intermediates and improved the rate-limiting step, thereby reducing the OER overpotential, as demonstrated by the experimental and DFT evidence. The photocurrent density was increased by 2.84 times and the onset potential of the OER reactions was reduced by 0.51 V. Moreover, the BP@WO3 composite photoanode maintained the initial photocurrent density during the 12 h durability assessment, benefiting from the efficient carrier exchange. This work may provide new opportunities for rationally designing the harmonious coexistence of BP-based electrocatalysts and photoanodes in solar water splitting.
