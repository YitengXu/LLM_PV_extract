        Y3Al5O12:Ce phosphors have been prepared and used as an effective scattering layer on top of a transparent layer of nanocrystalline TiO2 for dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The Y3Al5O12:Ce scattering layer increases the photocurrent of DSSCs due to the enhanced light harvesting mainly via the improved light absorption and scattering. Under one sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2), a high efficiency of 7.91% was achieved for the cell with a Y3Al5O12:Ce scattering layer, which is an increase of 13.5% compared to the cell without a scattering layer (6.97%).
Since the first report of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) by O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991, the DSSCs have attracted considerable attention and represent a key class of cell architecture that has emerged as a promising candidate for the development of next generation solar cells due to their high power conversion efficiency and low production cost.1–4 In the last decade, plenty of research has been carried out to improve the performance of DSSCs by various methods.5–10 It is known that the conventional semiconductor photoanode, typically TiO2, which is composed of small nanoparticles with size of 10–30 nm is transparent to the solar light and could not effectively utilize the incident light.11–13 Therefore, an efficient light scattering layer on a TiO2 layer has been suggested to localize the incident light within the electrode and enhance the light absorption by increasing the optical path length.14–18 However, it should be noticed that to date, the scattering layer is almost composed of large metal oxide particles such as ZnO, TiO2, and ZrO including aggregates, nano-embossed hollow spherical structure, meso or nanoporous beads, and nanoplates.19–24
Currently another attractive strategy to improve the light harvesting is the utilization of the light-converting materials including up-converting and down-converting materials, which transform lower (higher) energy photons into high (low)-energy visible photons that are easily absorbed by the dye.25,26 Several studies have doped the light-converting materials into TiO2 nanocrystallites26–28 or introduced the external light-converting layer onto the DSSCs device29 to improve their performance. However, such light-converting materials are seldom directly used onto the TiO2 layer for DSSCs.
In this study, we report a novel bifunctional structure layer composed of Y3Al5O12:Ce microparticles, offering both light scattering and light down-converting properties, on the top of the TiO2 layer for DSSCs. Y3Al5O12:Ce phosphors can absorb the higher energy photon well and remit the visible light at a longer wavelength which matches the absorption range of the dye. In the meantime, Y3Al5O12:Ce phosphor microparticles have a large size of 200–300 nm, similar to the ones of traditional metal oxide scattering particles, which is suitable for the light-scattering application. The as-synthesized DSSCs with a Y3Al5O12:Ce scattering layer show a conversion efficiency of 7.91% under one sun illumination, which is an increase of 13.5% compared to the cell without a scattering layer (6.97%).

        Y3Al5O12:Ce phosphors were fabricated by the co-precipitation method reported in our previous works.30 In brief, stoichiometric amount of Y(NO3)2·6H2O, Al(NO3)3·9H2O and Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (Sinopharm Chemical Reagents Co. Ltd.) were dissolved in deionized water to form a transparent stock solution of mother salts. The 2 M ammonium bicarbonate solution was prepared and used as the precipitant solution. The precursor precipitate was produced by adding the mixed salt solution at a speed of 3 ml min−1 from a burette into the ammonium bicarbonate solution. The as-prepared precursor powder was placed in an alumina crucible and calcined at 1000 °C for 4 h in an alumina tubular furnace in N2 gas. (See the detailed experimental procedure in ESI† for preparation and characterization.)

Fig. 1 shows the field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800) image of Y3Al5O12:Ce particles. The Y3Al5O12:Ce particles have a diameter in the range of 200–300 nm and are monodisperse. The composition of the sample was identified by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) measurement, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1.

UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra of P25 and P25/Y3Al5O12:Ce electrodes were measured using a UV-vis spectrophotometer with integrating sphere (Hitachi U-3900), as shown in Fig. 2(a). It is observed that the P25/Y3Al5O12:Ce electrode has a higher light reflectance than bare P25 electrode. Fig. 2(b) shows the photoluminescence (PL) excitation and emission spectra of Y3Al5O12:Ce phosphors using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon, FluoroMax-4). Two absorption peaks at 340 nm and 456 nm are assigned to the characteristic 4f1 → 5d1 transition of Ce3+ions. A broad emission spectrum with a peak at 526 nm was observed under the excitation of 456 nm, it is a typical 5d1 → 4f1 broad emission of Ce3+. The luminescence at 526 nm falls in the good absorption range of the dye sensitizer N-719. Therefore, the result indicates that Y3Al5O12:Ce can be used as effective light down-converting materials to improve the light harvesting for DSSCs.

The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves of DSSCs with P25 and P25/Y3Al5O12:Ce photoanodes are shown in Fig. 3(a). The open circuit potential (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and conversion efficiency (η) of all the cells are listed in Table 1. It can be observed that the Jsc and η have largely increased from 12.97 mA cm−2 and 6.97% for the cell with P25 to 14.91 mA cm−2 and 7.91% for the cell with P25/Y3Al5O12:Ce photoanode, respectively. However, the change of Voc and FF is small, which is ascribed to the following reasons. (1) The value of Voc is determined by the difference between the Fermi level of the TiO2 electrode and the redox potentials of I−/I3,31 and the Fermi level of the TiO2 electrode has been not changed by adding a Y3Al5O12:Ce layer. (2) The FF is mainly dependent on the series resistance (Rs).32 However, the Rs values of the cells with and without a Y3Al5O12:Ce layer are almost same (11.6 and 11.1 Ω) derived from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra in Fig. 3(c). The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra show that the cell with the P25/Y3Al5O12:Ce photoanode exhibits a maximum IPCE value of 50% at 530 nm, while for the cell with the P25 photoanode, the peak reaches 48%, as shown in Fig. 3(b). Moreover, an increase of IPCE value in the range from 400 to 450 nm for the cell with the P25/Y3Al5O12:Ce photoanode is observed due to the absorption of the Y3Al5O12:Ce layer.

The advantages of using Y3Al5O12:Ce as a scattering layer in DSSCs could be summarized as follows: (1) improved absorption of the Y3Al5O12:Ce layer in the range of 400–450 nm, which favors improvement of the Jsc for the cell,33 and light down-converting performance of Y3Al5O12:Ce, which has been confirmed from the PL excitation and emission spectra. The light harvesting of the dye can be increased by absorbing more suitable photons, leading to the improvement in conversion efficiency for DSSCs;25–29 (2) increased light scattering, which has been confirmed from the enhanced diffuse reflection of the P25/Y3Al5O12:Ce electrode; (3) lower electron transfer resistance. The EIS spectra of the cells with P25 and P25/Y3Al5O12:Ce photoanodes were performed under 100 mW cm−2 illumination and shown in Fig. 3(c). The spectra are composed of three semicircles situated in high, intermediate, and low frequency regimes. In general, three semicircles extending from total series resistance (Rs) can be recognized and fitted according to an equivalent circuit model shown in Fig. 3(d), where the finite diffusion element is also represented by the shunt resistance and low frequency constant phase element (CPE).32 The semicircle in the high frequency region represents the impedance corresponding to charge transfer at the counter electrode (RCT1), while those in intermediate frequencies and the low-frequency region give information on the impedance at the TiO2/electrolyte interface (RCT2) related to the charge transport/recombination and finite diffusion of the electrolyte (RW), respectively.31,32 The fitted RCT2 of the cell with the P25/Y3Al5O12:Ce photoanode at intermediate frequency is lower than that of the cell with the P25 photoanode, reflecting the acceleration of the electron transfer process in the photoanode. This result indicates that the introduction of the scattering layer of Y3Al5O12:Ce favors the electron transfer and suppresses electron recombination. However, it is observed that the adsorbed amount of dye in P25 and P25/Y3Al5O12:Ce electrodes is almost the same from the absorption spectra of the dye loading in the electrodes, as shown in Fig. 3(e), which indicates that most of the dye is not absorbed in the Y3Al5O12:Ce layer but in the TiO2 layer. That is due to a much lower Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of Y3Al5O12:Ce micro-particles (5.10 m2 g−1) than P25 (53.86 m2 g−1). It also shows that the dye loading doesn't play an obvious role in the improvement of the cell performance in this work.
In summary, Y3Al5O12:Ce phosphors have been employed as a scattering layer for DSSCs. Due to the enhanced light harvesting mainly via the improved absorption and scattering, the as-prepared DSSCs with a Y3Al5O12:Ce scattering layer show a marked improvement in conversion efficiency (7.91%) compared with the cell without a scattering layer (6.97%).
