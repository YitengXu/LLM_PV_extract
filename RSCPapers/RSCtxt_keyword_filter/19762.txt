The carrier transport layer in most polymer solar cells is composed of a TiO2 layer, and the thickness and homogeneity of this layer strongly influence the cell's power conversion efficiency. However, despite considerable development efforts, it is difficult to produce precisely-controlled TiO2 layers at room temperature with low fabrication times and without using materials that are toxic to humans. Here, we demonstrate semitransparent polymer-based solar cells fabricated via a simple wet lamination process with a TiO2 layer produced by an automatic spray layer-by-layer (spray-LBL) self-assembly method for improved solar cells. The spray-LBL method produced nano-ordered precursor films, composed of the non-toxic materials poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) and titanium(IV) bis(ammonium lactato) dihydroxide (TALH), from water solutions with high uniformity in a short fabrication time, and these films were then annealed to transform them into TiO2 layers at different temperatures. After TiO2 layer preparation, the polymer solar cells were fabricated via a lamination process. The resulting cells were semitransparent and generated electricity by using the incident light from both the front and back sides. These semitransparent polymer-based solar cells produced power conversion efficiencies of more than 2% by varying the TiO2 layer thickness via control of the spray-LBL process and the annealing temperature.
Introduction
Organic solar cells offer numerous specific advantages as renewable energy sources since the development of semiconducting polymers, which has made these cells highly suitable for flexible applications. In term of their properties, organic solar cells are lightweight, have large surface areas and can be colourful. While the widespread use of inorganic solar cells remains limited because of the cost of the required fabrication processes, which require elevated temperatures of between 400 °C and 1400 °C, high vacuum processing and several lithographic steps, polymer-based solar cells can be processed more simply from solution. This has enabled these devices to resolve the processing challenges and emerge as a low-cost alternative to inorganic solar cells over the past few decades.1–4
The simplest polymer solar cell structure consists of an electrode, an electron transport layer, an activated polymer layer, a hole transport layer and another electrode. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is one of the most popular materials for use as a carrier transport layer in bulk heterojunction solar cells because of its high band gap and high transparency in the visible range.5–7 Control of the thickness of the titanium dioxide layer is very important, because this layer affects both the series resistance and the shunt resistance of a solar cell. The TiO2 phase also has a correlation with the characteristics of polymer-based solar cells. In bulk heterojunction solar cells, TiO2 has three possible phase states, where the anatase phase has a higher band gap and lower resistivity than the rutile and brookite phases.8,9 In this experiment, we fabricated TiO2 layers using non-toxic materials such as TiF4, TiCl4 and acetylacetone10–13 at room temperature, which is promising for industrial-scale processing of these layers in the future.
We report here the successful demonstration of semitransparent polymer-based bulk heterojunction solar cells using these TiO2 layers to increase the maximum efficiency of the solar cells. Each TiO2 layer was processed from water-based solutions with a simple fabrication process (Fig. 1), and this process is likely to be applicable to other types of solar cells, e.g., dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)14 or perovskite solar cells.15 To improve the maximum efficiency of the solar cells by modifying the TiO2 layer, an automatic spray layer-by-layer (spray-LBL) self-assembly method that we established in our previous study was used.16–19

Spray-LBL19 is a technique for thin film fabrication that was developed from the layer-by-layer self-assembly process.20–24 The thin film formed by this fabrication method has many benefits when compared with other fabrication methods that are suitable for industrial applications, including deposition at room temperature, large area deposition, atmospheric deposition, and use of non-toxic solutions. Also, this method is suitable for TiO2 layer fabrication, and the use of this fabrication technique with a titanium(IV) bis(ammonium lactato) dihydroxide (TALH) water-based solution for solar cells has not previously been reported. In this study, we report the fabrication of electron transport layers in solar cells with controlled film thicknesses and structures by the spray-LBL method.
Experimental
Materials
This section presents the names of the chemicals used in the fabrication processes for the semitransparent solar cell, along with their suppliers. We used poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), titanium(IV) bis(ammonium lactato) dihydroxide (TALH) (50 wt% suspension in water, Sigma-Aldrich) and fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (SPD Laboratory, Inc., Hamamatsu, Japan) to produce the TiO2 layer for the solar cells. Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan), [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methylester (PCBM) (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (PH500, Clevios, Heraeus, Leverkusen, Germany), D-sorbitol (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates with Ag nano-networks (Toda Kogyo Corp., Hiroshima, Japan) were used to fabricate the semitransparent polymer-based solar cells.4,25 Glass substrates (76 × 26 mm, thickness = 1.0 mm, refractive index = 1.52, Matsunami Glass Ind., Ltd., Kishiwada, Japan) were used for each analysis process (X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ellipsometry measurements). All LBL solutions were fabricated using ultra-pure water (Aquarius GS-500.CPW, Advantec, Japan). The FTO glass and the glass substrates were cleaned in acetone and a KOH solution (1:120:60 wt% KOH/H2O/IPA) for 5 min and 10 min, respectively, and were then rinsed thoroughly using ultra-pure water before use.
Preparation of titanium dioxide electron transport layer
The TiO2 electron transport layers were fabricated on the FTO glass and the glass substrates by the spray-LBL process for semitransparent polymer-based solar cells. An automatic spray-LBL machine was developed in our previous research.19 To prepare a single bilayer, the FTO glass and the glass substrate were alternately sprayed with a PDDA cationic solution (10 mM, pH 5.5) and a TALH anionic suspension (0.1 wt%, pH 3.5), and were rinsed three times with pure water after deposition of each layer. The film thickness was controlled by controlling the number of bilayers that were applied. The spray conditions included a spray nozzle diameter of 1.2 mm, droplet sizes in the 10–100 μm range, solution and water flow rates adjusted to 4.0 mL min−1. The distance between substrate and nozzle was fixed at 15 cm, and the spray pressure was controlled at 0.05 MPa. After precursor film preparation by spray-LBL, the samples were annealed at various temperatures (300, 350, 400, 450 and 500 °C) for 20 min to prepare anatase-type titanium dioxide layers.
Semitransparent polymer-based solar cells fabrication
The P3HT and PCBM blend solutions were prepared with 50 mg mL−1 concentrations of monochlorobenzene. The weight ratio of P3HT to PCBM was 1:1. The solutions were deposited on TiO2 layers by spin-coating at 1200 rpm and were then annealed at 150 °C for 15 min on a hot plate. Simultaneously, PEDOT:PSS solutions containing D-sorbitol at a concentration of 1 wt% were deposited on the Ag nano-network (Ag NW) PET films by spin-coating at 3000 rpm. The final solar cells were then fabricated by pressing the Ag film component and the active layer component together at approximately 0.01 MPa in a simple wet lamination process; the resulting devices were then annealed at 140 °C for 10 min.
Characterization
Field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, S-4700, Hitachi, Japan) images were taken with an accelerating voltage of 5 kV to characterize the surface topographies of the films. The thicknesses and refractive indexes of the thin films that were coated on the substrates were determined by ellipsometry (MARY-102, Five Lab, Japan) and film thickness measurements (Dektak 3030, ULVAC, Japan). Transmittance in the 200 to 1000 nm spectral range was measured using a spectrophotometer (UVmini-1240, Shimadzu, Japan). The haze values of these films were measured using a haze meter (NDH-5000, Nippon Denshoku Industries, Tokyo, Japan) with a white light-emitting diode (5 V, 3 W) as an optical source. Crystallization of the TiO2 layer was analysed by XRD (D8, DISCOVER, Bruker, Japan) using Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 40 mA), at a scan rate and a step size of 2° min−1 and 0.01°, respectively. The surface elemental compositions of the samples were identified by XPS (JEOL JPS-9000MX). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cells were measured using an AM 1.5 solar simulator (100 mW cm−2) and an automatic polarization system (Hokuto Denko HSV-100) that used a 500 W Xe lamp (UXL-500SX, Ushio) as a light source. The active areas of these devices are fixed at 0.2827 cm2. The series resistance (Rs) and the shunt resistance (Rsh) were approximated using a one-diode model via a simulation program (the fitting of the J–V characteristic is shown in detail in the ESI†).26–28
Result and discussion
The spray-LBL process consisted of four steps for one bilayer: (1) spraying of cations; (2) first rinse; (3) spraying of anions; and (4) second rinse, which promoted uniform film growth with 5 nm film thickness per bilayer (Fig. 2). Based on the difference in mass for a single bilayer (Fig. 3), the TALH spraying solution had more of an effect on film growth than the PDDA spraying solution.

The crystalline structures of the TiO2 films that were deposited on glass after the spray-LBL and annealing processes at different temperatures were analysed using XRD measurements (Fig. 4). The film changed into an amorphous form at annealing temperatures of more than 450 °C. The main peaks of the two-theta angles at approximately 37.36° and 43.59° corresponded to anatase (004) and rutile (210) phases, respectively. The crystalline sizes of anatase (004) and rutile (210) phases at the different annealing temperatures were determined using Debye–Scherrer's formula (Fig. 4, Table 1, and ESI, Fig. S1†):29 
D = 0.94λ/(βcosθ)
(1)where D is the crystalline size, λ is the wavelength of the Cu Kα X-ray source, which was equal to 0.154 nm, β is the full width at half maximum of the peak and θ is the maximum peak angle. The crystalline size of the anatase phase was higher because the PDDA compound evaporated at annealing temperatures lower than 300 °C.30 In the case of annealing temperatures of between 300 °C and 400 °C, the crystalline content of the anatase phase and the rutile phase were both reduced because of thermal decomposition. In particular, annealing at temperatures between 310 °C and 385 °C caused low evaporation rates in terms of weight loss, and the crystalline sizes after annealing at between 300 °C and 400 °C were also reduced, which indicated that the TiO2 structure was mixed with the PDDA compound and formed a metal–organic structure. In the case where the annealing temperature was higher than 450 °C, the crystalline size was large and changed into an amorphous form, because the PDDA compound was completely evaporated at approximately 415 °C. Therefore, in this temperature range, the thin films contained only the TiO2 compound. However, in this annealing temperature range, the crystallinity of TiO2 was again reduced because of the calcination effect.31

XPS measurements were performed to investigate the effects of the different annealing temperatures on crystalline change and to confirm the changing crystallization of the amorphous TiO2 nanoparticles at temperatures of more than 400 °C (Fig. 5). The oxygen peaks at 530 eV and 531.5 eV, which corresponded to O2− and OH−, derived from the oxygen component of the TiO2 nanoparticle and the hydroxyl group of titanium ammonium lactate, respectively.9,32 After annealing, the intensity at the OH− peak was reduced and that at the O2− peak was increased because of the oxidation effects of the titanium ammonium lactate component containing the OH− compound in this chemical functional group in the films. The OH− component has been found to be acceptable for inverted organic solar cells in previous reports.33,34 The titanium ammonium lactate was changed into titanium dioxide according to the XPS peak, which showed the high quality TiO2 thin film crystallization at annealing temperatures higher than 450 °C. These results and the associated discussion were supported by the results of previous research,35,36 which resulted in the oxidation of titanium nitride at annealing temperatures higher than 400 °C.

The surface morphologies of the TiO2 films deposited on glass before and after annealing at the different temperatures are shown in Fig. 6. The film surfaces consisted of titanium oxide nanoparticles. As the annealing temperature increased, more of the PDDA compound evaporated, which indicated that the more porous film structure was derived from the nanoparticles on the surfaces of the films. The thin film roughness also increased with increasing annealing temperature, because the crystalline sizes of the rutile and anatase phases were dependent on the annealing temperature. The high surface roughness can increase the efficiency of the resulting solar cells,37 and therefore was appropriate for use in solar cells. The surface morphology of the TiO2 layer deposited on FTO glass after annealing at 450 °C is shown in Fig. 7. The surface roughness and the sizes of the TiO2 nanoparticles on FTO glass were larger and the films were more porous than those fabricated on the glass substrates (ESI, Fig. S2†).

Fig. 8 shows the transmittance of a TiO2 layer on a glass substrate (see also ESI, Fig. S3†). The transmittance of the TiO2 layer before annealing showed the highest value, because the polymer compound was blended with the titanium dioxide layer and reduced the refractive index. However, with increasing annealing temperature, the transmittance was reduced, because the polymer compound in the film evaporated and the refractive index thus increased. The refractive index increased from 1.68 (before annealing) to 1.90 (after 350 °C anneal). The refractive index, the haze value and the energy band gap are shown in Table 2. The haze value was saturated at temperatures higher than 350 °C.

A Tauc plot is shown in Fig. 9 that can be used to indicate the energy band gap from the following relation: 
(αhν) = A(hν − Eg)2
(2)where α is the absorption coefficient determined from the transmittance value, hν is the optical energy, A is a constant and Eg is the optical band gap. The energy band gap also depended on the annealing temperature, and it was reduced from 3.30 eV in the as-deposited case to 3.20 eV at annealing temperatures of around 350 °C. This result corresponds with the XRD results: the energy band gap has a relationship with the crystalline quality of the TiO2 layer, where the crystalline quality can be determined based on the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the XRD data (shown as part of the ESI†). The reduction in the energy band gap was caused by the evaporation and thermal decomposition of the polymer component in the TiO2 layer. The reduction of the crystalline quality of the rutile type and contrasting increase in crystalline quality of the anatase phase can be estimated from the XRD analysis, which was explained earlier. For annealing temperatures higher than 350 °C, the optical energy band gap was stable at around 3.20 eV, corresponding to the energy band gap of the anatase and rutile phases of titanium dioxide.38 Also, the haze value of TiO2 on FTO increased after annealing (Table S1†) because the PDDA compound evaporated after annealing and was replaced by air gaps that produced a more porous structure in the thin films.
 Fig. 9  Tauc plot of TiO2 layers fabricated by spray-LBL method on glass substrates before and after annealing at various temperatures. 
The variations in the properties of solar cells with changing annealing temperature are shown in Table 3. The characteristics of the solar cells depended on the annealing temperature, because the structures and grain sizes of the TiO2 nanoparticles varied. The maximum efficiency was 1.51% after annealing at 450 °C. As shown in the XRD results, when the grain size was large, the grain boundary was reduced according to the peak of the anatase (004) phase after annealing at 450 °C, and the rutile (210) phase was formed, which reduced the conductivity and increased the recombination at the interface between TiO2 and the active layer. The series resistance (Rs) was reduced at annealing temperatures below 450 °C, because the TiO2 phase was changed to the amorphous anatase phase. At annealing temperatures above 450 °C, Rs increased, because the TiO2 rutile phase had higher resistivity than the anatase phase.8 The shunt resistance (Rsh) was higher at annealing temperatures below 450 °C, because the crystal quality of the TiO2 anatase phase was higher. However, at annealing temperatures above 450 °C, Rsh was reduced, because the anatase phase changed to the rutile phase and the grain size (from XRD and SEM imaging) was reduced because of the increased grain boundaries that make the mobility in the titanium dioxide layer decrease and the efficiency of the solar cell drop. These results are in good agreement with the results of the experimental report by Roy et al.39 They fabricated TiO2 nanorods for DSSCs, and found that the annealing temperature affected both the grain size and the crystalline structure of the TiO2 nanorods: at annealing temperatures above 500 °C, the crystalline phase changed from the anatase to the rutile phase. In addition, they explained that the changes in the grain boundaries and the mobility in the TiO2 layer also have a major effect in changing the efficiency of solar cell devices.39

Tables 4 and 5 show the J–V characteristics of bulk heterojunction solar cells and the optical characteristics of the TiO2 layer, depending on the TiO2 layer thickness, respectively. The thicknesses of the TiO2 nanoparticle layers were controlled by changing the number of bilayers of TALH and PDDA. In the case where there are 22 bilayers (112 nm), the efficiency, the open circuit voltage (Voc), the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and the fill factor (FF) were 2.04%, 0.54 V, 6.73 mA sq−1 and 0.56, respectively. The benefit of the TiO2 layer is that it can reduce recombination between the generation area and the electrode contact, and the leakage current can be also reduced by the TiO2 layer. However, the TiO2 layer has high resistivity when the film is thick, and Rs also increased, which has a further negative effect on the solar cell efficiency. In this case, Rs increased when the TiO2 layer was more than 22 bilayers (112 nm) thick. In contrast, the recombination effect increased when the TiO2 layer was thin, and Rsh increased when the number of bilayers was increased from 20 (103 nm) to 22 bilayers (112 nm). In this experiment, the film thickness of 112 nm was found to be the most appropriate thickness for bulk heterojunction solar cells in terms of efficiency. Ou et al. fabricated the TiO2 layers by CVD.40 Their film thickness at maximum efficiency was thinner than that of our solar cells, because our solar cells consisted of a TiO2 layer with lower density and higher porosity than that produced by the CVD technique, because they were derived from a solution process to form a metal–organic compound followed by the evaporation of the organic compound to transform the layer into a film of titanium dioxide alone.

The transmittance of solar cells at light wavelengths longer than 700 nm was higher than 60%, as shown in Fig. 10, which showed better results than those of the previous report4 because of the increased haze value caused by high surface roughness on the TiO2 layer (the haze values are shown in ESI, Table S1†). As the haze value increased, the transmittance in the near-infrared region also increased because of the diffuse transmittance.41 Fig. 11 shows the current density–voltage characteristics of the semitransparent solar cells for optical incidence in the directions from both the front and back sides of the solar cells. The efficiency under front side illumination was higher than that under back side illumination, because the structure of the PEDOT:PSS layer offered a lower bandgap than PCBM and P3HT, which absorbed the high energy photons and reduced the generation effect at the active layer. The transmittance under front side illumination was also lower than that under back side illumination because of differences in photo-adsorption. The cells under back side illumination had lower conversion efficiencies than those under front side illumination, which was caused by the 60% transmittance on the press-Ag NW counter electrode covered with PEDOT/PSS (PEpress-Ag NW); in other words, the PEpress-Ag NW counter electrode prevented 40% of the light transmission that should enter into the cells, as proved by the lower photocurrent densities (Jsc) of cells under back side illumination. Although electrons were generated by illumination on both sides, the cells showed lower cell performances during back side illumination.25 Also, we successfully fabricated bulk heterojunction solar cells without an annealing process (Fig. S4 and Table S2†), showing that the maximum efficiency was 0.7% when using 24 bilayers.

We improved the efficiency of the solar cell module. Based on related studies using PCBM and P3HT for the active layers in bulk heterojunction solar cells,42–44 the maximum efficiency of this type of solar cell was improved by changing the electrode contact to a vapour-deposited silver thin film on a PET substrate (Fig. 12). The conditions of the solar cells with 22 bilayers after annealing at 450 °C were selected (because they were the best conditions shown in Table 4). The maximum efficiency of this type of solar cell was 2.90%. The efficiency of the cells with the silver thin films was higher than that of the cells with the silver nano-network, because the sheet resistivity of the silver thin film (less than 0.5 Ω sq−1) was lower than that of the silver nano-network (around 10 Ω sq−1), which thus reduced the series resistivity of the solar cells.

Conclusions
We have successfully fabricated TiO2 electron transport layers, based on PDDA and TALH from a water-based solution, via the spray-LBL method for solar cell applications. The titanium dioxide structure deposited on glass by the spray-LBL method was composed of both anatase (004) and rutile (210) phases. The largest crystalline sizes of the anatase (004) and rutile (210) phases were achieved after annealing at 450 °C and without annealing, respectively. Before annealing, the films had high surface roughness that was derived from the titanium nanoparticles. After an increase in the annealing temperature, the film refractive index was increased by increasing the high crystallinity of TiO2, and the haze value was also increased because of the formation of a porous structure in the film. The optical energy band gap was reduced from 3.30 eV to 3.20 eV. After preparation of the TiO2 layer via the spray-LBL using a water-based solution with the best conditions for the surface morphology, precise thickness control and the optical properties, semitransparent bulk heterojunction solar cells were successfully fabricated. The efficiency of these organic thin film solar cells depended on the thickness of the titanium dioxide layer, and the semitransparent polymer-based solar cells had power conversion efficiencies of more than 2% after improving the TiO2 layer thickness, which was controlled via the spray-LBL method. This study will contribute to the development of semitransparent polymer solar cells through non-toxic processes with low costs, eco-friendly processing and short fabrication times for larger area devices in the future.
