    , Accepted 10th February 2017First published on 10th February 2017AbstractLike other polymer industries, the polymeric semiconductor industry is under pressure due to the need for eco-friendly processes and regulations on the emission of harmful solvents. However, in the case of polymeric semiconductors, the use of halogenated solvents (or at least aromatic solvents) has been considered essential because the self-assembly properties of the alkyl chain determine the performance of the final device; however, these solvents are harmful to the environment. In this review, the research efforts to avoid using toxic organic solvents without sacrificing high semiconductor performances are summarized for: (1) non-halogenated solvents, (2) polar solvents, and (3) aqueous media. More specifically, methodologies to achieve stable dissolution or dispersion of polymeric semiconductors in greener solvents are introduced: polymerization with new backbone structures, polymerization with new side chain structures, and various mini-emulsion-based nanoparticle production methods. This review aims to contribute to the development of new technologies that enable eco-friendly/high-performance processes in the field of organic semiconductors by providing up-to-date information on the eco-friendly processes of organic semiconductors.

Introduction
Polymeric semiconductors are key building blocks for future lightweight, flexible, and portable electronic devices.1,2 Although the issues related to low charge-carrier mobilities have been greatly overcome by novel molecular design and synthesis, undesirable processing conditions still limit their compatibility with low-cost, flexible, and printable electronics. Until now, all the “record-high mobility” values (>5 cm2 V−1 s−1) have been obtained for polymeric semiconductors processed from toxic solvents, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, and other aromatic organic solvents.3–6 Various morphological/structural analyses have shown that chlorinated solvents can impart a high solubility to the polymer semiconductor, a high degree of crystallinity, and the preferred orientation at the time of thin film formation.3–7
However, it should be noted that such chlorinated organic solvents and other aromatic organic solvents, which usually enable the high performance of polymeric semiconductors, are actually very toxic in terms of environmental effects and effects on human health.8 Considering the industrial trend to be more environmentally conscious, solvent-borne fabrication processes using toxic organic solvents should be avoided to restrict solvent emissions, especially when polymer coatings are being applied. Accordingly, there have been meaningful research efforts to develop greener fabrication processes for polymeric semiconductors with the same desirable electrical properties that have often been obtained with solvent-based polymeric semiconductors. Nonetheless, such green fabrication methods still possess some limited performances; thus, there is room for further development. Nowadays, in most other polymer industries, water-borne polymer techniques have replaced the traditional role of solvent-based polymer techniques. Processes that use environment-friendly solvents for conjugated polymers have already achieved great success in similar areas, such as electrode fabrication.9 Therefore, the field of organic semiconductors also needs to find a break-through technique for realizing high performances without sacrificing environmental issues. In this review, we summarize the research efforts made for developing greener fabrication methods for polymeric semiconductors with high charge carrier mobilities and free from toxic organic solvents so that the readers can find helpful information for their own research (Fig. 1–3). In particular, considering the rapid growth of organic semiconductors in terms of the charge carrier mobility, which is now exceeding the minimum industrial requirement,10 the development of an environmentally benign process is a very urgent task. In this review, we focus on polymeric semiconductors for field-effect transistor (FET) applications fabricated using green fabrication processes; however, in the last section, we also introduce recent research results for other opto-electronic applications fabricated via green methods.

1. Overview of high-mobility polymer field-effect transistors (PFETs) processed using toxic, chlorinated non-polar solvents
For several decades, FETs based on various organic materials with semiconducting properties, such as conjugated polymers, oligomers, and small molecules, have been developed as alternatives to Si-FETs.11–14 Among those, polymeric semiconductors have been regarded as the mainstream research theme because of their mechanical robustness and compatibility with flexible substrates. The charge carrier mobility of such solution-processed polymeric semiconductors is strongly influenced by the microstructure, molecular ordering, and localized aggregation via the planar backbone structure. Therefore, molecular engineering to maximize such a favorable arrangement of the polymer backbone has been the major research issue. Before 2012, the governing idea of maximizing the charge carrier mobility of polymeric semiconductors was realized with a self-organized edge-on orientation on the substrate so that charge carrier hopping could proceed along the π–π stacking direction. However, more recently, the presence of localized polymer aggregates was determined to have a more decisive role in charge transport regardless of the preferential edge-on/face-on orientation of the polymeric semiconductor.11 For instance, near-amorphous polymers based on indacenodithiophene showed hole mobilities of 1.0 cm2 V−1 s−1. In this case, face-on oriented polymers showed higher mobilities than those oriented in an edge-on fashion.15–17 Dense molecular packing is also an important factor for efficient charge transport in PFET applications.15,16 From the perspective of molecular packing engineering, the π–π stacking distance, degree of crystallinity, and degree of crystalline perfectness are widely studied in line with aggregates of conjugated polymers.11 These research trends of more aggregation and denser crystalline packing inevitably required very rigid backbone structures, which would limit the solubility of polymeric semiconductors.16
Early PFET studies focused on regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) with a maximum hole mobility of 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 driven by the optimal edge-on orientation.18 The analogue of P3HT with a decreased side chain density, poly(3,3′′′-dialkyl-quaterthiophene) (PQT), was also developed with a higher hole mobility of 0.12 cm2 V−1 s−1.19 Another representative classic conjugated polymer, poly(2,5-bis(3-tetradecylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2,-b]thiophene) (PBTTT), was developed to further improve the molecular packing over that of polythiophene; PBTTT provided a hole mobility of 1.0 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was characterized by extended π–π stacking. These classic polymeric semiconductors were strongly influenced by the choice of the processing solvent.20–22 Usually, the use of chlorinated organic solvents, such as chlorobenzene, resulted in higher charge carrier mobilities than those resulting from the use of non-chlorinated solvents, such as toluene.
More recently, researchers targeted planar fused-ring aromatic cores, which could boost the π-overlap between neighboring cores. The new donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers, such as diketopyrrolopyrrole and isoindigo-based polymers, were successful in reducing the π–π stacking distance and enhancing the backbone planarity.23–25 The charge carrier mobilities of these new D–A copolymers reached breakthrough hole mobilities exceeding 1.0 cm2 V−1 s−1, which are comparable to those of amorphous silicon semiconductors. For instance, 1,4-diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene moieties (PDBT-co-TT) showed a hole mobility of 0.94 cm2 V−1 s−1, and selenophene-containing poly-[2,5-bis(2-decyltetradecyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-(2H,5H)-dione-(E)-(1,2-bis(5-(thiophen-2-yl)selenophen-2-yl)ethene] (PDPP-SVS) exhibited a hole mobility of 1.5 cm2 V−1 s−1. Li and coworkers reported diketopyrrolo-pyrrole-dithiophene-thienothiophene (DPP-DTT) with a high hole mobility of 10.5 cm2 V−1 s−1 by controlling the conjugation in the donor portion.3,26,27 In addition, poly[2,5-bis(alkyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione-alt-5,5′-di(thiophen-2-yl)-2,2′-(E)-2-(2-(thiophen-2-yl)vinyl) thiophene] (PDVT) revealed a hole mobility of 8.2 cm2 V−1 s−1 achieved by incorporating the highly π-extended structure between two thiophene rings adjacent to the diketopyrrolopyrrole units in the main chain.4 Side chain engineering enabled further improvements, as shown by Kang and coworkers, with the highest field-effect hole mobility of 12.0 cm2 V−1 s−1 using the diketopyrrolopyrrole polymer.5 In a similar context, the isoindigo series (representative donor–acceptor copolymers) also showed a hole mobility of 3.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 by controlling the polymer symmetry and backbone curvature.28 Combined with side chain engineering efforts, an isoindigo-based conjugated polymer that adopted a siloxane-terminated solubilizing group resulted in a mobility of 2.48 cm2 V−1 s−1.29 As follow-up research progresses, Kim and coworkers accomplished the highest field-effect hole mobility of 14.4 cm2 V−1 s−1 based on poly(thienoisoindigo-alt-naphthalene) (PTIIG-Np).6 Recently, with an amorphous polymer, the indacenodithiophene–benzothiadiazole copolymer exhibited a hole mobility of up to 3.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 upon increasing its molecular mass.30 Interestingly, well-aligned polymer fibers of poly[4-(4,4-dihexadecyl-4H-cyclopenta[1,2-b:5,4-b′]dithiophen-2-yl)-alt-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine] (PCDTBT) showed a hole mobility of 23.7 cm2 V−1 s−1, the highest value reported for a PFET.7 In keeping with the steep progress in p-type semiconductors, n-type semiconducting polymers have also been developed by many researchers. For example, Kwon et al. reported the ambipolar DPP-based copolymer, poly[2,5-bis(2-octyldodecyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione-(E)-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)-3-(thiophen-2-yl)acrylonitrile]) (PDPP-CN-TVT), incorporating the cyano group as an electron-withdrawing group. PDPP-CN-TVT showed hole/electron mobilities of 0.75 and 7.0 cm2 V−1 s−1.31
Despite the advantages of D–A copolymers with strong aggregation properties, these copolymers have the common disadvantage of low solubility. The solubility of a solute is determined by the relative solute–solvent and solute–solute intermolecular interactions. The strong intermolecular interactions of high-mobility donor–acceptor copolymers incorporating planar repeating moieties prohibit efficient solute–solvent intermolecular interactions. Normally, the solution concentration of such rigid copolymers cannot exceed 10–20 mg mL−1 in dichlorobenzene.32 Such a low solubility seriously limits the availability of the rigid copolymers despite their superior electrical characteristics. The solubilities of these new polymeric semiconductors are very limited even when bulky, branched alkyl chains were applied to donor–acceptor copolymers to enhance the solubility.28 Therefore, the toxic fabrication processes became even more serious for the new, high-mobility polymeric semiconductors with a planar backbone.
2. PFET fabrication using conjugated polymers dissolved in non-chlorinated non-polar solvents
As discussed above, most of the polymeric semiconductors with high performances have been processed using chlorinated solvents, such as chloroform and chlorobenzene. However, environmental regulations restrict the use of toxic chlorinated solvents because of safety and pollution concerns;33 thus, alternative methods for processing the conjugated copolymers using non-chlorinated solvents are needed.
To make polymeric semiconductors soluble in environmentally benign, non-chlorinated solvents, we need to understand the factors related to solubility. Here, we introduce the Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs) to calculate the degree of solubility between the polymers and solvents. The theoretical solubility parameter space (Ra), which describes the different HSPs of the polymers (1) and solvents (2), can be obtained by eqn (1),34 (1)where δd, δp, and δh are the dispersion force solubility parameter, dipolar intermolecular force solubility parameter, and hydrogen bonding solubility parameter, respectively. The HSPs provide simple, but powerful, information to better understand the degree of molecular interaction between the polymers and solvents; lower Ra values can be related to a higher degree of molecular interaction between the polymer and a solvent. Based on this method, Fu et al. reported a comparative analysis for the solubility of DPP-based D–A copolymer in various solvents and showed that a small change in the HSPs can result in significantly different solubilities.35 Specifically, we can adjust the solubility of a polymer in a target solvent by controlling the intermolecular forces, such as the dispersion force, dipole intermolecular force, and hydrogen bonding in polymer molecules.
In this section, we hope to provide meaningful guidelines for D–A copolymer synthetic strategies for improving their solubility in non-chlorinated solvents while preserving their high charge-carrier mobilities. The synthetic approach of polymeric semiconductors to achieve a reasonably high solubility in non-chlorinated organic solvents can be categorized into three methods: (1) random copolymerization, (2) asymmetric structuring, and (3) enriching the volumetric portion of alkyl chains so that the resulting copolymer can possess a higher solubility in relatively nonpolar, non-chlorinated solvents. Both (1) and (2) enable lower degrees of intermolecular forces.
2.1. Random copolymerization
Random copolymers consisting of two differently shaped building blocks can simply exhibit weaker molecular interactions than homopolymers because of the decreased intermolecular forces that increase the solubility.36
Yun et al. suggested a novel synthetic strategy for designing D–A copolymers that provide sufficient solubility in environmentally benign solvents, such as tetralin, via random copolymerization.37,38 They focused on minimizing the polymer–polymer interactions, such as dipole intermolecular forces, by irregular polymer backbone structuring. They synthesized three different random copolymers, PDPP-BTT(1)-SVS(9), PDPP-BTT(3)-SVS(7), and PDPP-BTT(5)-SVS(5), each of which contains two slightly different repeating units, DPP-selenophene-vinyleneselenophene (DPP-SVS) and DPP-bithienothiophene (DPP-BTT).37 Based on a tetralin–fabrication process, they achieved the highest mobility of 6.51 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PDPP-BTT(1)-SVS(9), corresponding to a random copolymer with the smallest BTT portion. To further understand the underlying mechanism of random copolymers, the same group reported similar but more in-depth studies using two-dimensional grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (2D GIXD) studies.38 In this study, they synthesized random copolymers using two different repeating units, the DPP-thienothiophene (DPP-TT) unit and the DPP-selenophene-vinylene-selenophene (DPP-SVS) unit, both of which already showed high mobilities as homopolymers (>10 cm2 V−1 s−1). They introduced various composition ratios (PDPP-TT(9)-SVS(1), PDPP-TT(7)-SVS(3), PDPP-TT(5)-SVS(5), PDPP-TT(3)-SVS(7), and PDPP-TT(1)-SVS(9)) for comparative studies.
PDPP-TT(5)-SVS(5), which was expected to have the highest segmental randomness from the initial intuitive, did not show a strong π–π stacking behavior along the in-plane profile GIXD data. Even for the out-of-plane diffraction spectra, the Bragg peak intensity was the lowest for this random copolymer with equal amounts of the two repeating units. However, all other random copolymers with composition ratios of 1:9, 3:7, 7:3, and 9:1 showed well-ordered crystalline features with clear evidence of π–π stacking. Based on these observations, they concluded that random copolymerization did not seriously interrupt the long-range ordering of polymer chains within this series of copolymers, possibly because of the strong aggregation properties of both the repeating units, DPP-TT and DPP-SVS. As a result, they could demonstrate high charge carrier mobilities >5 cm2 V−1 s−1 using tetralin as a processing solvent.
2.2. Asymmetric copolymer
Decreasing the dipolar intermolecular force is another solution for dissolving D–A copolymers in non-chlorinated solvents, as introduced by Choi et al.39 They synthesized asymmetric D–A copolymers ((E)-2-(2-(thiophene-2-yl)vinylselenophene, TVS) without a strictly regular alternating structure. The DPP moiety could chemically couple with a thiophene (T) or selenophene (S) end in a TVS moiety, so that T and S were irregularly distributed in the donor moieties along the PDPP-TVS conjugated backbone. These pseudo-regular alternating copolymers were highly soluble, even in non-chlorinated solvents, such as toluene, o-xylene, and tetralin, unlike PDPP-TVT and PDPP-SVS. Choi et al. utilized 2D-GIXD data to investigate how the processing solvents affected the crystallinity and molecular orientations in the film state.
The 2D-GIXD patterns and the corresponding out-of-plane and in-plane profiles are shown in Fig. 4. The (00h) and (010) diffraction peaks were predominantly observed along the out-of-plane (qz) and in-plane (qxy) directions, respectively. These observations indicate that polymers in all thin films tend to have a long-range ordered lamellar crystalline structure and an edge-on structure relative to the substrate. The crystalline properties of the thin films were not significantly different from the corresponding properties of films prepared from the regularly alternating copolymers. The PDPP-TVS PFETs exhibited excellent charge carrier mobilities of up to 8.2 cm2 V−1 s−1. More recently, Ji et al. reported an asymmetric D–A copolymer, PDPPMT-2T, with a higher charge carrier mobility of up to 12.5 cm2 V−1 s−1 which is among the highest among PFETs processed with non-chlorinated solvents. To improve the charge-carrier mobility, they induced high aggregation and crystallinity using a binary solvent system of toluene/biphenyl ether.40

2.3. Enriching the volumetric portion of the alkyl chain in polymer molecules
The solubility of a polymer depends on the alkyl chain density in the polymer molecule because the higher volumetric portion of the hydrophobic side chain can induce a higher solubility in nonpolar solvents. Some D–A copolymers could be dissolved in non-chlorinated solvents by using a long branched alkyl chain. Fu et al. reported a bithiazole-based n-type conjugated polymer, poly(dithienyldiketopyrrolopyrrole-bithiazole) (PDBTz).41 Although most of the DPP-based conjugated copolymers including a long branched alkyl chain are more soluble in chlorinated solvents than non-chlorinated solvents, the solubility of the PDBTz in non-chlorinated solvents was higher than that in the chlorinated solvents. In addition, they obtained the electron mobility of 0.31 cm2 V−1 s−1 in p-xylene, higher than the electron mobility of 0.26 cm2 V−1 s−1 obtained from dichlorobenzene. To explain this characteristic, they calculated HSPs of PDBTz by using requisite software (Hansen Solubility Parameters in Practice 3rd edition). The calculated Ra of PDBTz was more similar to the HSPs of non-chlorinated solvents than the HSPs of chlorinated solvents. Similarly, Sonar and coworkers reported an ambipolar DPP-based conjugated polymer, poly{3,6-difuran-2-yl-2,5-di(2-octyldodecyl)-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione-alt-3,4-difluorothiophene} (PDPPF-DFT), processed by hexane. They used the substitution of a fluorine atom, which is a popular electron-withdrawing group of a D–A copolymer. Therefore, the PFET based on PDPPF-DFT showed a high and balanced hole/electron mobility of 0.26 and 0.12 cm2 V−1 s−1.42
More recently, Bao et al. suggested the synthesis and characterization of a fused thiophene-diketopyrrolopyrrole-based semiconducting polymer for increasing the solubility of the D–A copolymer.43,44 They synthesized a DPP-based polymer including fused thiophene-diketopyrrolopyrrole with four linear alkyl chains, which was dense enough to impart significant solubility to the resulting copolymer, PTDPPTFT4. PTDPPTFT4 can be dissolved in non-polar solvents, such as tetralin, because of its larger alkyl chain density than conventional DPP-based polymers. The PTDPPTFT4 film exhibited highly ordered (100), (200), and (300) Bragg peaks along the out-of-plane qz axis, and the π–π stacking distance was comparable to conventional DPP-based copolymers. As a result, they achieved a high hole mobility in excess of 2 cm2 V−1 s−1, an on/off ratio of 106, and a threshold voltage below 2 V.
3. PFET fabrication using conjugated polymers with polar side chains dissolved in polar solvents
In this section, we summarize the research efforts to use polar solvents, including alcohols, which are generally more environmentally benign than aromatic organic solvents. These polar solvents have high intermolecular forces, such as dipole intermolecular forces or hydrogen bonds, which can dissolve polymers with hydrophilic functional groups. Conventional polymers that include ethylene glycol side chains have shown high solubilities in alcohols because an intermolecular hydrogen bond between the oxygen in the ethylene glycol moiety and the hydrogen atom of the polar solvent can form strong hydrogen bonds. Therefore, some researchers have tried to tune the side chains of polymeric semiconductors from alkyl-based side chains to molecularly engineered side chains containing oxygen aiming at solubility enhancement in polar solvents.
For example, Lu et al. synthesized oxetane-substituted conjugated polythiophenes (PTHOTs) that dissolve in alcohols.45 Oxetane is well known as a hydrogen-bond acceptor that can induce dipole–dipole attractions between oxygen and hydrogen. Shao et al. reported a thiophene-based conjugated polymer (P3TEGT) with triethylene glycol side chains that can be dissolved in water.46 These two results could not achieve reasonably high charge carrier mobility values (∼10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1), which could be attributed to the lack of lamellar structuring of the polymer chains. However, some research studies have shown that the use of oligo(ethylene glycol) could lead to better lamellar structuring of the resulting polymeric semiconductor than the use of a conventional alkyl chain, which may potentially promote OFET mobility.47,48
Very recently, the successful use of a polar side chain was reported by Kanimozhi and coworkers.49 A DPP-DPP-based conjugated copolymer (N-CS2DPP-OD-TEG) was synthesized with an alkyl chain and an oligoether chain as side chains, resulting in an enhanced solubility even in polar organic solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran. They revealed that the use of both oligoether chains and alkyl chains could increase the solubility of the conjugated polymer without sacrificing the common lamellar structure and a short π–π stacking distance, resulting in a high electron mobility of 3 cm2 V−1 s−1, as displayed in Fig. 5.

4. PFET fabrication using semiconducting polymer nanoparticles dispersed in polar solvents
Although the approach of using polar functional groups enables polymer dissolution in polar solvents, it limits the charge transport nature of the resulting polymers because of a lack of well-ordered lamellar stacking and charge trapping effects originating from the polarity of the side chain.45,46 To solve these problems, some researchers have tried to fabricate electronic devices using semiconducting polymer nanoparticles. However, these nanoparticles must meet several conditions to be dispersed in environmentally benign solvents via the solution process. First, the nanoparticles need repulsive forces between the particles to prevent Ostwald ripening. Second, the size of the nanoparticles must be rigorously controlled to achieve sufficient coalescence.50
Dimitrov et al. reported that nanoparticles below 300 nm are needed for strong coalescence between the nanoparticles and the substrate.50 This is also essential to fabricate fine thin films based on nanoparticles via a solution process. A simple method for synthesizing semiconducting polymer nanoparticles that could satisfy all the above conditions was introduced by Landfester et al.51 They made surfactant-containing nanoparticles from semiconducting polymers with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) using a miniemulsion process. The negative charge of SDS adsorbed at the surface of the particles prevented aggregation between the nanoparticles in the aqueous phase. As shown in Fig. 6, they produced stable semiconducting polymer nanoparticles with diameters ranging from 70 to 250 nm, which resulted in high-quality films with low roughness. After that, the surfactant-containing nanoparticles were applied in various devices, such as organic light emitting diodes, organic solar cells, and organic transistors, which were reported by Landfester.52–55 However, the transistor fabricated from surfactant-containing nanoparticles only showed low device performance because of the remaining electrically inert surfactants within the active layers. Therefore, one can see that the key research topic for the approach of polymer nanoparticles would be reducing the amount of residual surfactants after fabricating the target devices. In this section, we will introduce two major methods for tackling this problem: device fabrication using (1) surfactant-free nanoparticles and (2) surfactant engineering.

4.1. Surfactant-free nanoparticles
Normally, repulsive forces that prevent interparticle aggregation are not strong enough for surfactant-free nanoparticles made from hydrophobic polymers. Therefore, there are not many research approaches using this point-of-view.
Millstone and coworkers reported a method for fabricating surfactant-free nanoparticles that could be dispersed in alcohol using P3HT via a miniemulsion process.56 The particle size was rigorously controlled by their synthetic method using various initial concentrations. In addition, they showed comparative data between the surfactant-containing nanoparticles dispersed in ethanol and the surfactant-free nanoparticles dispersed in water. The FET mobility of the surfactant-containing nanoparticles was 1.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, and that of the surfactant-free nanoparticles was 1.6 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1. They demonstrated that the different electronic performances between the two particles were related to the degree of molecular packing for the films consisting of P3HT nanoparticles. Based on UV-vis and 2D-GIXD data, the authors showed a high degree of molecular packing for the particle-based films, which was comparable to that of chloroform-based P3HT films.
Chung et al. introduced a simple method for fabricating a sub-micron colloidal solution of polymeric semiconductors dispersed in a polar solvent, using sonication. They used a D–A semiconducting polymer with a high charge carrier mobility of up to 10 cm2 V−1 s−1 with the conventional organic solvent process, the so-called poly-diketopyrrolopyrrole-thienothiophene (PDPP-TT) in Fig. 7.57 In this work, the sub-micron colloids consisting of PDPP-TT showed a high charge carrier mobility of 2.7 cm2 V−1 s−1 in butyl acetate. More recent research from the same group includes a PFET consisting of a sub-micron colloid based on a D–A semiconducting copolymer using a more environmentally benign solvent, such as ethanol or butanol.58 Normally, it is hard to disperse a hydrophobic polymer, such as a semiconducting polymer, in alcohols because of the large hydrogen bonding parameter difference between the semiconducting polymers and alcohol according to HSPs. There were three strategies to fabricate fine thin films from polymer particles dispersed in alcohol: (1) using a random copolymer with a better dispersibility than conventional semiconducting polymers, (2) decreasing the surface tension of the target solvent, and (3) enhancing the coalescence behavior for achieving the fine film morphology.
 Fig. 7  Molecular structures of high mobility semiconductors and surfactants used for surfactant-assisted colloid fabrication. 
The authors used P-DPP-TT(7)-SVS(3),38 a random copolymer with a better dispersibility than a homocopolymer. Moreover, they tried to decrease the surface tension of the alcohols by mixing them with a small amount of an aldehyde, mainly to optimize the HSPs; the weakened hydrogen bonding of the alcohol can enhance the dispersibility of the particles.59 They successfully fabricated sub-micron sized polymer particles dispersed in alcohols. To further accelerate their sufficient coalescence behavior so that fine and even thin films could be generated, they added polyvinylidene fluoride as an additive, which could be dispersed in alcohol in a smaller size compared to P-DPP-TT(7)-SVS(3). Finally, by adopting all of these strategies, they demonstrated a continuous, crystalline, uniform semiconductor thin film from an alcohol.
The 2D-GIXD analyses results obtained for the films fabricated from alcohol-based colloids of P-DPP-TT(7)-SVS(3) together with those from chloroform are summarized in Fig. 8. The colloid-based films exhibited highly ordered but somehow broadened Bragg reflection peaks along the out-of-plane (qz axis). The pole figure analysis demonstrated that the colloid-based films prefer the edge-on orientation, which is favorable for charge transport. In addition, the π–π stacking distance was also comparable to that of the chloroform-based film. Collectively, these crystalline analyses indicated that films fabricated from an optimized colloidal solution maintained the polymer's own crystalline nature. As a result, a high charge carrier mobility of up to 1 cm2 V−1 s−1 could be demonstrated for the colloid-based PFET.

4.2. Surfactant engineering
Although the surfactant-free method is ideal for charge transport of the resulting polymer film, a relatively lower stability of the surfactant-free colloidal solution in the aqueous phase again proved the importance of a surfactant for the actual application of colloid polymer particles. Indeed, it is much easier to tune the particle size for a specific application using an appropriate surfactant. However, as highlighted earlier, the amount of remaining surfactant molecules in the active layer should be minimized because they are electrically inert, which can deteriorate the electrical performance of the final device. The simplest way to minimize such surfactant molecules would be by eliminating them after producing the active layer. In the reports of Landfester and coworkers, the adsorbed surfactants were eliminated by a post-washing step using pure water. However, as informed by poor FET performances with a charge carrier mobility of 1.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, the elimination of the surfactant was not satisfactory.55
To accomplish the actual minimization of the remaining surfactant, a heat-assisted surfactant elimination method was introduced by Chung et al., using a thermal window between a surfactant and a polymeric semiconductor with largely different molecular weights.60 They chose the optional elimination temperature by measuring the thermal degradation temperatures of both the semiconducting polymer and the surfactant. PBTTT, which shows a second transition characteristic at an annealing temperature of above 240 °C, was used as a semiconductor and fabricated as colloidal nanoparticles with the assistance of SDS using a miniemulsion method. Films cast from the PBTTT colloidal solution showed a well-ordered crystalline structure at the optimal elimination temperature of 270 °C, as confirmed by 2D-GIXD, with clearly decreased surfactant amounts, as confirmed by Fourier transform infrared analyses. The resulting PFET fabricated from water-borne polymer colloids exhibited a high charge carrier mobility of 0.2 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was similar to that of FET in the chloroform-based PBTTT film.
More recently, a novel strategy to eliminate the surfactant was introduced using a non-ionic surfactant, such as C12E4, C16E10, and C18E20, by Chung et al.61 They argued that the low electronic performances of the PFET based on surfactant-containing nanoparticles are due to a charge trapping effect driven by the strong polarity of the surfactant molecules. They also focused on the surface density of the surfactant, which can also influence the inter-particle charge transport. They paid attention to non-ionic surfactants, such as polyethylene glycol, which have a larger volume of hydrophilic moieties. In this case, the surface adsorption density of non-ionic surfactants could be lower than that of ionic surfactants, such as SDS, with a much smaller volume of hydrophilic moieties because of a steric hindrance issue. More importantly, they also found that these non-ionic surfactants were more easily eliminated by a post-washing process using ethanol because of a relatively lower adsorption density and a higher solubility in alcohol. In addition, they introduced the intrinsically high-mobility polymer, PDPP-SVS, to maximize the charge transport nature of the resulting polymer film.
The crystalline structures of the polymer films fabricated from water-borne colloids with non-ionic surfactants and the post-washing processes are shown in Fig. 9, and are compared to those from chloroform or the SDS-based colloid. One can see that after the washing step, the surfactant-containing nanoparticle films based on a non-ionic surfactant showed a long-range ordered lamellar crystalline structure and a preferential edge-on orientation comparable to that of the chloroform-based film; however, the surfactant-containing nanoparticle films based on SDS showed only a poor molecular packing behavior. As a result, they could demonstrate an unprecedentedly high charge carrier mobility of 2.5 cm2 V−1 s−1 from the water-borne colloid of polymeric semiconductors.

5. Organic semiconductors with an environmentally benign fabrication process for other opto-electronic applications
Similar to the cases of organic FETs, solution processes provide more attractive advantages for fabricating low-cost organic light emitting diode (OLED) and organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices compared to vacuum-based deposition techniques with high initial investments and low yields.62 Therefore, studies of OLEDs and OPVs with high performances using an environmentally benign fabrication process have been reported by many researchers. The first attempt to fabricate OLEDs using semiconducting conjugated polymer nanospheres using an environmentally benign process was reported by Landfester and coworkers.51 The resulting device achieved a maximum brightness of 0.3 cd A−1. In addition, Huebner and coworkers reported a high-performance OLED using water-borne nanoparticles composed of two different polymers: a green emitter and a blue emitter.63 The devices exhibited a maximum luminance value of 200 cd m−2 at 7.5 V, drawing less than 80 mA. In the case of OPVs, many researchers have focused on the long-term stability of the resulting devices and environmentally benign fabrication processes, which can complement the disadvantages of other high performance PVs with toxic chemical components, such as perovskite.64,65 Therefore, the environmentally benign processes employed for OPV production have been widely reported; currently, the electrical performance of OPVs from greener fabrication processes is comparable to that for OPVs processed using halogenated solvents.66–68
Recently, Zhao and coworkers reported an OPV from a non-chlorinated solvent with a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.47%, which was comparable to an OPV with the highest PCE (∼10%) processed using a chlorinated solvent.69 They used a relatively greener and unique solvent system, the so-called o-xylene/N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), which rendered a similar surface morphology for the organic active layer as the cases using chlorinated solvents. Colsmann et al. introduced a similar approach using a binary solvent system of o-xylene/anisaldehyde with a high PCE of 9.1%.70 Solvents that are more environmentally friendly than aromatic organic solvents were also intensively developed. Landfester et al. reported that phase-separated nanoparticles can be fabricated using a mini-emulsion method from a binary p/n polymer mixture system.52,53 The nanoscale phase separation between p-type and n-type semiconductors could contribute to an effective charge transport through a continuous percolation pathway. These approaches provide a guideline to other researchers for the bulk heterojunction solar cell with a high PCE from polar solvents.71–80 Using bulk heterojunction nanoparticles, Gärtner et al. reported OPVs fabricated from nanoparticles dispersed in alcohol with a PCE of 4.1%.75 Dastoor and Yamamoto realized a PCE of up to 2.5% from nanoparticles dispersed in an aqueous solution.71,76,77
The efforts made to overcome the use of toxic organic solvents in the field of organic opto-electronic devices are not confined to the active layer. The efforts to replace toxic organic solvents with environmentally benign solvents have been continuously made for various electronic components, including the electrode, dielectric layer, interlayer, and passivation layer.81 Interestingly, all-printed OPVs deposited from an aqueous solution were also reported by Søndergaard et al. with a PCE of 0.7%, which suggested the future prospects of all solution-processed devices fabricated using environmentally benign processes.82 The development of environmentally benign solution processes will dramatically change the demands of the organic semiconductor market.
Conclusions
Research over a long period has shown that the semiconductor properties of polymeric semiconductor materials are caused by self-assembly between polymer chains. Therefore, organic solvents can easily control the degree of self-assembly; among them, halogenated organic solvents have been widely used as the main solvents for polymeric semiconductors. However, considering the solvent emission regulations, it is difficult to commercialize polymeric semiconductor manufacturing technologies based on organic solvents; therefore, the development of an environmentally friendly polymeric semiconductor manufacturing technology is essential. This review focuses on technologies that successfully dissolve or disperse hydrophobic polymeric semiconductors in non-halogenated solvents, alcohols, or water. We comprehensively examined the design/synthesis of various new polymers, mini-emulsion-based nanoparticle preparations, and high-performance thin film manufacturing methods (Table 1). The performance of organic semiconductors has already reached a considerable level; thus, if this is supported by environmentally friendly manufacturing technologies, commercialization of organic semiconductors in various fields is expected to occur in the near future. We hope that this review will contribute greatly to the development of new technologies that enable environmentally friendly manufacturing of organic semiconductors.
