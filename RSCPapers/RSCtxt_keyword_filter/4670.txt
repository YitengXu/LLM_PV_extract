    , Accepted 23rd May 2014First published on 26th May 2014AbstractWe report one dimensional (1-D) transparent-conducting-oxide arrays coated with light-absorbing semiconductors to simultaneously maximize light harvesting and charge collection in a photoelectrochemical (PEC) system. Tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) nanowire (NW) arrays are prepared on ITO thin-film substrates as the transparent-conducting-oxide, and TiO2 or CdSe/CdS/TiO2 thin layers were coated on the ITO NW arrays as the solar light-absorbing layers. The optimal PEC performance, 0.85% under 100 mW cm−2 of light illumination, is obtained from ∼30 μm-long ITO NW, which is covered with ∼20 nm-thick TiO2 nanoshell. We finally demonstrate that the ITO NW-based photoelectrode is also compatible with one of the most efficient visible-light sensitizers, the CdS/CdSe quantum dot. Our approach using the transparent conducting 1-D array has wide potential to improve the PEC performances of conventional semiconducting materials through liberation from the poor charge transport.
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, one of the methods of artificial photosynthesis, is a topic of great interest due to its potential to develop a sustainable energy supply system.1–4 PEC water splitting produces chemical energy, i.e. hydrogen/oxygen molecules, by using the solar power and water source, which is an almost endless, renewable, and eco-friendly system. Recently, the research on the PEC reaction was extended to generating hydrocarbon fuels by using the chemical reaction of hydrogen and CO2, which can recycle CO2, a greenhouse gas.5
In general, photoelectrodes for the PEC system are based on semiconducting materials that absorb light, separate the photo-generated charges, and transport the charges. If it is not a tandem structure, the semiconductor must have a higher conduction band edge than the hydrogen reduction level and a lower valence band edge than the oxygen oxidation level. Simultaneously, it is essential to have a sufficiently narrow band gap to fully absorb the solar light. Another requirement for the semiconducting material is a high chemical stability such that it will not react with electrolytes under an extreme condition, such as non-neutral pH. There are not many materials that can satisfy all of the above requirements. Up to now, metal-oxide semiconductors, such as TiO2,6–8 ZnO,9 α-Fe2O3,3,10 and WO3,11 have been intensively investigated as highly efficient photoelectrode materials. However, they have not yet fully proven their expected PEC performance. For instance, α-Fe2O3 has a high theoretical solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of ∼13% under air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) solar irradiation,12 whereas the reported experimental performance is less than 25% of the theoretical limit.10 One of the main reasons for the worse-than-expected performance is the large loss of photocharges before their reaching the electrolyte or conducting electrode, due to a short charge diffusion length.13 TiO2, one of the most famous ultraviolet (UV)-based catalysts, is also under a similar situation; the short charge-diffusion length of <70 nm for a hole14 and a narrow depletion layer of ∼40 nm (in KOH electrolyte),15,16 despite a long optical path (>few μm) necessary for the full absorption of incident light.17 Therefore, it seems that recent efforts towards testing various nanostructures are essential to find a compromise.
One-dimensionally (1-D) nanostructured semiconductors, such as nanotubes18,19 and nanowire (NW) arrays,6,20,21 have been intensively studied as a prospective alternative to conventional thin-film- or nanoporous (NP) film-based photoelectrodes. Those 1-D nanostructures offer better charge separation/transport and light absorption than thin films or NP films, owing to a shorter charge carrier path to the electrolyte and fewer charge-trapping sites, thus enabling loading of a larger volume of light-harvesting material by lengthening the 1-D semiconductor. However, 1-D semiconductors cannot increase the length infinitely because they, also, cannot completely decouple the charge-transport and light-harvesting issues.
Therefore, we herein suggest a strategy to decouple the charge transport and light harvesting: limit the role of the semiconductor to light harvesting and charge separation, and give the role of charge transport to 1-D transparent conducting oxide (TCO). To demonstrate it, we synthesized TiO2 nanoshell coated, Sn-doped In2O3 (ITO) NWs vertically on an ITO thin-film substrate. In this structure, the conductive and simultaneously transparent ITO NW core can minimize the electron loss and light interruption, whereas the extremely thin but sufficiently large volume of TiO2 layer, because of tens of micrometer-long ITO NWs, minimizes the hole-transport path to the electrolyte while maximizing the light absorption. We previously reported a similar structure (TiO2/ITO NW) on a metal-mesh substrate.16 However, it was difficult to increase the PEC performance using this structure at a high level because the metal mesh and radially grown ITO NWs on it block or scatter a large amount of incident light. Moreover, exposure of a very small area of metal substrate would deteriorate the photoelectrode by the corrosion reaction with the electrolyte. In this work, we present a vertical TiO2/ITO NW array on a flat ITO/glass substrate and optimize the length of ITO NWs and the thickness of TiO2 nanoshell for PEC performance of the photoanodes. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of this novel photoanode for highly efficient visible-light-active PEC water splitting by adopting CdS/CdSe quantum dots (QDs) at the surface of the TiO2 nanoshell.
ITO NWs were grown on ITO substrates (200 nm-thick ITO thin film on glass) by a vapor-transport method (VTM), in a fused silica-tube furnace, using indium and tin powders as sources (see Experimental methods for more details). The sources were evaporated at 800 °C, and NWs were grown at 600 °C with Au as a catalyst. As shown in Fig. 1a–c, ITO NW arrays are grown vertically on ITO substrates. The NWs can be grown up to about 50 μm in just 30 min at 600 °C. The length of the grown NW is almost proportional to the consumed (i.e. evaporated) source amount (see Fig. S1, ESI†). Because the evaporation amount of the metal source increases with reaction time, the length of the NWs is controlled by varying the reaction time, i.e. oxygen gas flowing time. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the NW array (see Fig. S2, ESI†) shows that the NWs have the cubic crystal structure of In2O3. The 2θ peak position of the NW array is identical to that of the ITO substrate, but the extraordinarily high (400) peak intensity, compared with that of ITO substrate, verifies a good vertical alignment of ITO NW with preferred orientation to (400) plane. Fig. 1d–f are TEM images of a typical individual ITO NW. The selective area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern shown in Fig. 1g reaffirms that the NWs are grown to [100] direction of the In2O3 cubic structure (a = b = c = 10.1 Å). The single crystallinity of the NW is confirmed by the fact that the SAED pattern does not change when taken at different spots along the NW axis; NWs rarely had grain boundary and void. EDS analysis (see Fig. S3, ESI†) shows that indium oxide is doped with ∼3.8 at% of Sn, thereby forming ITO (tin-doped In2O3) NW. The electrical resistivity of the ITO NWs grown via similar VTM has been reported as about 4.7 × 10−4 Ω cm (4.1 at% of Sn),22 and 7.15 × 10−4 Ω cm (∼3.8 at% of Sn).23 In this study, we also obtained a comparable resistivity (6.2 × 10−4 Ω cm, using the four-probe method) from our typical ITO NW, which is also comparable to commercially available ITO thin films (6 × 10−4 Ω cm) deposited on glass.24 From the spherical heads at the tips of the NWs, Au (0.7 at%), In (12.8 at%), Sn (22.1 at%) and O (64.4 at%) are detected. The presence of Au and extremely high concentrations of Sn at the spherical head implies that the ITO NW is grown by formation of Au/Sn eutectic, which is a well-known soldering alloy. Although ITO NWs could be grown on a bare ITO substrate without Au seeds (see Fig. S4, ESI†), the growth rate without Au is fairly slow (by ∼18 times; 3 μm long NWs for 30 min of growth). Therefore, it is likely that ITO NWs grow mainly in the manner of vapour–solid–liquid (VLS) mechanism.23,25 Recent reports also support the VLS growth of ITO with the aid of an Sn–rich In–Sn–O formation when it is grown with Au catalyst.26,27

When applying to a PEC system, light harvesting materials having appropriate band-gap energy and conduction-band edge need to be coated onto the ITO NWs. We selected TiO2 as the light-harvesting material, which is one of the most stable and efficient UV-light-active photocatalysts. A TiO2 nanoshell is well formed on the surface of the ITO NWs by the atomic layer deposition (ALD) method. The thickness of the TiO2 nanoshell varied from ∼3 nm to ∼40 nm with increasing deposition cycles from 300 to 1500 (see Fig. S5, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 2a and b, the TiO2 nanoshell uniformly covers the ITO NW single-crystalline core without any cracking. Otherwise, the ITO NWs would contact directly with an electrolyte during the PEC measurements, which can cause undesirable backward current leakage. Using HRTEM, a smooth and continuous interface of the TiO2 nanoshell and ITO NW is confirmed (Fig. 2c). The SAED pattern (Fig. 2d) of the TiO2 nanoshell shows the bright spots that make concentric rings, indicating that the nanoshell is polycrystalline TiO2. The SAED and XRD pattern (Fig. 2e) of the nanoshell are indexed to the anatase phase, which is known as the best phase for the PEC system among the TiO2 polymorphs, owing to its highly active surface,28 fast (slow) charge transport (recombination),28,29 and conduction-band edge position.30 After ALD, we annealed the as-deposited samples at 450 °C for 1 h because the as-deposited samples exhibited several times lower PEC performances, compared with the annealed samples, in a preliminary test (not shown here). The increased anatase (101) peak intensity after annealing (Fig. 2e) appears to have resulted from the improved crystallinity of the TiO2 nanoshell, which is a decisive factor for determining the PEC cell performance.

Photocurrent density (J)–applied voltage (V) curves of the ITO NW-based photoelectrodes with 20 nm-thick TiO2 nanoshells are plotted in Fig. 3a. In darkness, the current density was negligible (<10−5 A cm−2, not shown) in the presented voltage range. Under illumination, the photocurrents increase drastically, and the open-circuit voltages are about 0.2 V vs. RHE. The photocurrent density increases significantly with increasing the length of the ITO NW. The 30 μm-long ITO NW-based photoelectrode shows the highest photocurrent, 1.9 mA cm−2 (at 1.23 V vs. RHE), which is ∼7.5 times larger than that of the 0 μm-ITO NW-based photoelectrode (i.e. ALD TiO2-coated ITO thin film, without NW)-based photoanode. The photoconversion efficiency (η) curves for the 20 nm-thick TiO2-based photoelectrodes are presented in Fig. 3b, which are calculated using the following equation,21  where jp is the photocurrent density, E0rev the standard state-reversible potential (i.e. 1.23 V vs. RHE), I0 the intensity of the incident light, and Eapp the applied potential vs. RHE. The photoanode with 30 μm-long ITO NW shows the highest maximum efficiency (ηmax) of 0.85% (at 0.55 V), which is ∼8.7 times higher η, compared with the 0 μm-ITO NW. The photocurrent density at 1.23 V (vs. RHE) as the function of ITO NW length is plotted in Fig. 3c. The photocurrent increases as the length of ITO NW increases, and it saturates over an optimal length. It is noteworthy that the increasing rate of the photocurrent is larger in a thicker TiO2 nanoshell. Given that the increase of TiO2 thickness improves the light absorption due to the overall volume increase of the light-harvesting material, this result is reasonable. It can be considered that the optimal length, of course, decreases as the thickness of the TiO2 nanoshell increases, although the optimal lengths of the 3 nm- and the 10 nm-thick TiO2-based photoanodes could not be obtained in this study due to the limit of the ITO NW length (< ∼55 μm). We checked the optical absorption property of the TiO2/ITO NW samples by measuring the absorptance (= 100% − transmittance − reflectance). Fig. 4 shows that the light absorptance increases and finally saturates as the length of the ITO NW increases. Non-absorbed 25–35% of UV light after saturation is regarded as loss due to the scattering/reflection at the surface of the TiO2 or TiO2/ITO interfaces. The ITO NW length for the saturation reduces as the TiO2 thickness increases, which is consistent with the trend of PEC performance shown in the inset of Fig. 3c. Therefore, the decrease of the optimal length for PEC performance with increasing TiO2 thickness can be attributed to the increase of TiO2 loading volume per NW length. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the saturated (i.e. maximum) value of absorptance gradually decreases by 18% (from ∼80% to ∼65%) with increasing TiO2 thickness, which is a similar trend with the optimal photocurrent. The decrease in the maximum absorptance by increasing the TiO2 shell thickness is partly responsible for the decrease of the optimal photocurrent density with increasing TiO2 shell thickness. However, light-absorption behaviour cannot fully explain the significant drop of the optimal photocurrent by ∼25% (1.9 mA cm−2 in the 40 nm-thick TiO2 to 1.4 mA cm−2 in 20 nm-thick TiO2). It may be explained by the fact that the photocurrent of the 40 nm-thick TiO2/ITO thin film (0 μm-ITO NW) is lower than that of the 20 nm-thick TiO2/ITO thin film (0 μm-ITO NW) (Fig. 3c), despite the higher absorptance (absorptance of the 0 μm-ITO NWs in Fig. 4). The photogenerated charge collection is strongly influenced by the photocharge separation, which is promoted by a depletion layer (i.e. space charge layer) at the TiO2/electrolyte interface. The depletion layer of TiO2 is reported to be less than 40 nm in KOH.16 Therefore, it is expected that the photogenerated charges become more difficult to separate when the TiO2 shell gets thicker. On the other hand, the 30 μm-long ITO NWs with 3 nm- and 10 nm-thick TiO2 show worse PEC performance, compared with the 30 nm-thick TiO2/30 μm-long ITO NW sample, in spite of similar light absorption, and presumably similar surface area and charge separation properties. Considering their low fill factors of the J–V curves (Fig. S6, ESI†), such a thin TiO2 layer may not be sufficient for blocking the back electron transfer, which may cause the poor PEC performances of the thin TiO2-based photoelectrodes.

The electrolyte is KOH aqueous solution (1 M). J–V curves of the other photoelectrodes are shown in Fig. S6, ESI.† (c) The photocurrent density at 1.23 V (vs. RHE) of each photoelectrode as the function of ITO NW length.

In Fig. 5, the photoconversion efficiencies of various-types of TiO2-based photoanodes, such as TiO2 thin film, TiO2 NP film, TiO2 nanotube (NT), and TiO2 nanoshell-coated ITO NW (TiO2/ITO NW), are compared as the function of the thickness of the photoactive layer. The optimal photoconversion efficiencies of the thin film and the NP film are less than 0.2% (J–V curves of the NP film samples are shown in Fig. S7, ESI†). On the other hand, TiO2/ITO NW-based photoanode exhibits ∼0.85% of ηmax. It is comparable in performance to TiO2 NT,19 which is known as one of the most efficient nanostructures for PEC water splitting. It is very impressive that the photoconversion efficiency of the ITO NW-based photoanode constantly increases until the thickness of photoactive layer reaches a few tens of μm in length. The excellent performance of the TiO2/ITO NW-based photoanode might be owing to the excellent light-harvesting ability as well as the efficient charge separation because of the extremely long and highly conductive ITO NWs that are covered with sufficiently thin TiO2 layers, which are thinner than the charge-depletion layer. Strikingly, the PEC performance of the TiO2/ITO NW-based photoanodes could be improved further (η ∼1.5%) by H2-annealing at 350 °C for 2 h, the results of which are also plotted in Fig. 5 (J–V curves of the H2-annealed samples are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†)). We post-annealed the air-annealed TiO2/ITO NWs in a reductive atmosphere (H2) for the purpose of enhancing the electrical conductivity of ITO NWs and the TiO2 nanoshell. An inevitable degradation of electrical conductivity of ITO by oxidative annealing at more than 300 °C (ref. 31) can be successfully recovered to the initial conductivity by the H2 annealing, as we previously reported.32 Moreover, recently, it was reported that the H2 annealing of TiO2 at more than 350 °C improves the PEC performance dramatically, owing to the ∼3 orders of magnitude increase of donor density, which is derived from the upsurge in oxygen vacancies in TiO2.21 The X-ray photoemission spectra of our samples (Fig. S8, ESI†) show a similar result with the reported H2 annealed TiO2;21 the O 1s XPS peak of TiO2 at around 529.6 eV of binding energy (BE) shifted to a lower BE, and the intensity of peak at around 531.5 eV of BE deceased, which indicate an increase of electron density in nearby oxygen atoms and hydroxyl group.

The inset illustrates the compared nanostructures: thin film, NP film, NT, and TiO2/ITO NW. The NP films were fabricated using a commercial TiO2 nanoparticle (P25). The TiO2 NT data is cited from the literature (100 mW cm−2, filtered Xe lamp, 1 M KOH).19 
In this TCO NW-based photoanode, neither the light absorption nor the charge-transport properties of the nanoshell material can be important factors that limit the PEC performance because light absorption can be simply enlarged by increasing the NW length not by increasing the light-harvesting materials thickness, hence it does not bring about the increase of the recombination probability in the light-harvesting material. Therefore, one of the greatest advantages of the TCO NW vertical array is that it offers a wide choice of light-harvesting materials as the nanoshell. For instance, the TiO2 nanoshell can be alternated to or combined with visible-light-harvesting materials. We demonstrate it by sensitizing the TiO2/ITO NWs with CdS/CdSe QDs, which have smaller band-gap energy (2.4 eV for CdS and 1.7 eV for CdSe in bulk) than TiO2 (3.1 eV). CdSe and CdS QD layers are sequentially coated on the surface of the TiO2/ITO NW photoanodes via a chemical bath deposition method (see Experimental methods for more details). The morphology and phase of CdSe and CdS layers are checked by TEM (the inset of Fig. 6a) and XRD analysis (see Fig. S9a, ESI†). CdS/CdSe crystallites (see HRTEM image shown in Fig. S9b, ESI†) cover well the surface of TiO2 nanoshell. The QD-sensitization enables visible-light absorption up to 700 nm (i.e. ∼1.7 eV) as shown in Fig. 6a. The PEC J–V curves (Fig. 6b) of the QD-sensitized TiO2 (20 nm)/ITO NW photoanodes, measured under the simulated solar light (1.5AM, 100 mW cm−2), show a gradual increase of photocurrent with increasing the length of ITO NW. The optimal photoconversion efficiency from the measured samples is 2.1%. Given that the processes for the CdSe and CdS sensitization were not optimized in this study, the PEC performance of the ITO NW-based photoelectrode under visible light is still promising. Additionally, given that the resistivity of the ITO NW can be lowered to ∼2 × 10−4 Ω cm by increasing the Sn content in ITO NW,27,33 the PEC performance can be further improved.

(b) J–V curves of the QD-sensitized TiO2/ITO NW-based photoanodes, measured in a three-electrode system under illumination of simulated solar light (1.5 AM, 100 mW cm−2). A mixed solution (1:1 volume ratio) of Na2SO3 (0.35 M) and Na2S (0.25 M) were used for the electrolyte. 
In summary, to simultaneously optimize the light absorption and the charge-transport properties by separating the responsible layers for each part, transparent conducting ITO NW arrays with light-absorbing TiO2 shell layers, are prepared as photoanodes for PEC system. By varying the ITO NW length and the TiO2 nanoshell thickness, an optimal photocurrent of 1.9 mA cm−2 (at 1.23 V vs. RHE) and photoconversion efficiency of 0.85% were obtained under 100 mW cm−2 of light (filtered Xe lamp) illumination. By H2-annealing, the photoconversion efficiency was enhanced to 1.5%. The photoconversion efficiency of the photoanode increased until the length of the ITO NW reached a few tens of μm. After sensitization with CdS/CdSE QDs, the TiO2/ITO-based photoanode exhibits considerable photoconversion efficiency (2.1%) under the 1.5 AM solar-light illumination (100 mW cm−2). This result suggests that the transparent-conducting-oxide NW vertical array is likely to be compatible with other efficient photocatalysts, which may open a new prospect in exploring new materials for efficient solar-driven artificial photosynthesis.
Experimental methods
Materials preparation: synthesis of ITO NWs, deposition of TiO2 nanoshell, and QD sensitization
ITO NWs were grown on as-received ITO substrates (200 nm-thick ITO thin film on glass, 10 Ω □−1) by a vapor-transport-method in a fused silica-tube furnace. Indium (99.99%) and tin (99.99%) powders (Sn:In = 1:3, atomic ratio) were placed at one end of the tube furnace and evaporated at 800 °C. Au-sputtered (∼10 nm) ITO substrates were placed at the other side of the tube furnace and maintained at 600 °C during the growth reaction. The growth of ITO NWs was triggered by oxygen inflow (1.5 sccm) into the furnace at 2 mTorr of basal pressure. The length of the ITO NW was controlled by the reaction time, i.e. oxygen flow time. Without the oxygen flow, nothing was grown on the ITO substrate. TiO2 was deposited on the grown ITO NWs by a plasma-enhanced ALD method at 300 °C using titanium tetra-isopropoxide and H2O as the Ti precursor and oxidant. The thickness of the TiO2 nanoshell was controlled by the ALD deposition cycles. After ALD, the as-deposited samples were annealed at 450 °C for 1 h, which is the optimized annealing condition for the PEC performance by preliminary experiments. A following reductive annealing was conducted in H2 atmosphere (H2:N2 = 1:3) at 350 °C for 2 h in a tube furnace.
The CdSe and CdS QD layers were formed on the surface of the TiO2/ITO NW by following a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method.34 First, the TiO2/ITO NW photoanodes were alternately immersed in Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.5 M in ethanol) at room temperature for 5 min and Na2S (0.5 M in methanol) at room temperature for 5 min. These steps were repeated four times, followed by annealing at 300 °C for 30 min in air. The photoanodes were then alternately immersed in Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.5 M in ethanol) at room temperature for 5 min and Se solution (0.3 M Se dissolved in aqueous 0.6 M Na2SO3) at 50 °C for 60 min; these steps were repeated four times. Finally, the photoanodes were alternately immersed in aqueous Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O (0.1 M) and aqueous Na2S (0.5 M), and repeated twice (30 s each), followed by annealing at 150 °C for 30 min in air.
In order to compare the TiO2/ITO NW-based photoanodes with several representative conventional TiO2-based photoanodes, TiO2 thin film-based, and NP film-based photoanodes were prepared. The TiO2 thin films were deposited on the thin film ITO substrate via ALD. The NP films were fabricated by spin coating commercial TiO2 powder (P25, Degussa)-based slurry (dispersed in water/ethanol with 10 vol% of acetyl acetone) on the thin-film ITO substrate. Both types of photoanodes were post-annealed at 450 °C for 1 h in air.
Characterization of the nanostructures and PEC properties
The nanostructures were analyzed by using a HRTEM (JEM 3000F, JEOL) and an SEM (model JSM-6330F, JEOL). The crystalline structures were identified using an XRD (M18XHF-SRA, MAC-Science Instruments). XPS (SIGMA PROBE, ThermoVG, UK) spectra were acquired using a monochromatic Al-K source (100 W), and the binding energy was calibrated with respect to the C (1s) peak set as 284.6 eV. The optical absorbance, transmittance and reflectance of the samples were measured using a UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer (U-4001, Hitachi) and a quantum efficiency measurement system (QE-1100, Otsuka Electronics) equipped with an integrating sphere. The resistivity of the ITO NWs was measured by a four-probe method using a source meter (Model 2400, Keithley). The metal electrodes were patterned via photolithography and Au/Ti (100 nm/30 nm) sputtering. The PEC characteristics of the prepared photoanodes were measured in a quartz reactor with the aid of a potentiostat (CHI 608C, CH Instruments), under illumination of white light (100 mW cm−2, filtered Xe lamp), or simulated solar light (100 mW cm−2, 1.5 AM; HAL-320, Asahi spectra). All the light intensities were double-checked using a spectroradiometer (ILT950, International Light Technologies). The prepared samples were used as photoanode (1 cm2 of active area). The saturated calomel electrode and Pt-plate were used as reference and counter electrodes. For the electrolytes, an aqueous solution of KOH (1 M, pH 13.6) or an Na2SO3 (0.35 M)/Na2S (0.25 M)-mixed solution (1:1 volume ratio, pH 12.6) were used. The scan rate for the J–V measurement was 50 mV s−1.
