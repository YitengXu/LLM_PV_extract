    , Accepted 24th January 2018First published on 25th January 2018AbstractKnowledge of band alignments and heterostructure formations is fundamental for a new generation of optoelectronics based on two-dimensional layered materials. Herein, band alignments and heterostructures of IVB-VIA monolayer MX3 (M = Zr, Hf; X = S, Se) and VIIB-VIA monolayer MX2 (M = Tc, Re; X = S, Se) are calculated by density functional theory with hybrid functionals. The results indicate that for monolayer MX3, the valence bands mainly depend on the p state of the chalcogens and the conduction bands mainly depend on the d state of the transition metals. In contrast, for monolayer MX2, both valence and conduction bands depend on the d state of the transition metals. This suggests that their work functions are obviously different. Meanwhile, the characteristics of the band alignments and the planar-averaged local density of states show that ZrS3, HfS3, TcSe2 and ReS2 could be favorable candidates for photocatalytic water splitting. ZrS3, HfS3 and MX2 with the same structures are able to form type II heterostructures at their interfaces, which could be used for solar energy conversion. The power-conversion efficiency of an MX3 thin-film solar cell is approximately 16–18%, which is higher than those of MX2 thin-film solar cells. In addition, for heterostructures composed of MX3, both of the two kinds of material (M and X) play an important role in every band formation. Meanwhile, for MX2 heterostructures, almost every band depends only on a single material. The charge density difference of the heterostructures demonstrates a higher charge accumulation at the interface of MX3 heterostructures than that of MX2 heterostructures. These phenomena show that type II heterostructures formed of MX3 are more stable than those of MX2.
1. Introduction
The successful realization of layered materials such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and transition metal trichalcogenides (TMTs) has opened a whole new era of two-dimensional (2D) electronics and photonics connected with novel concepts and potential applications.1–3 These new kinds of application include photocatalysts,4,5 photovoltaics,6,7 photodetection,8,9 spintronics,10 wearable optoelectronics,11 and electroluminescence devices,12 due to the excellent optoelectronic properties of 2D materials. In these applications, heterojunction formations and band alignments play a key role in the design and tuning of carriers at interfaces by heterostructures. The band alignment is the energy band profile, which demonstrates discontinuities in both the conduction and valance bands, resulting in the energy change of the carriers passing through the heterojunction. 2D materials contain strong covalent bonds in plane and van der Waals (vdW) interactions out of plane.13 The surface flatness of 2D materials can reach the atomic scale and there are no dangling bonds, strain, or defects at their surfaces. The lattice matching conditions of 2D materials at interfaces are dynamically relaxed once different 2D materials are stacked to form heterojunctions. There are many kinds of 2D materials, including approximately 40 different kinds of VIB-VIA 2D TMDs (MX2, M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te, band gaps between 1 eV and 2 eV).14 Schottky junctions, semiconductor–semiconductor heterojunctions, and tunnel junctions can be easily obtained by controlling the stack order and materials.13 The potential field gradient of heterojunctions composed of 2D materials is at the atomic level. Furthermore, heterojunctions formed by 2D materials have a strong capability for carrier separation with a high gate response.15 Finally, 2D materials display strong light–matter interactions.16 The photoelectric conversion efficiency of heterostructures composed of 2D materials is approximately 1–3 orders of magnitude higher than that of traditional semiconductor materials.6 Thus, 2D materials provide an excellent platform for the study of band alignments and heterostructures, which may provide clues to the next generation of optoelectric devices and high performance photocatalysts.13,17,18
Recently, there have been some reports on the band alignment properties of the most studied 2D TMDs, MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te), and heterostructures.19–22 The results suggest that they could form type II heterostructures, which could be used for optoelectronics and energy conversion. Moreover, the photoelectric properties of heterojunctions are barely affected by interlayer interactions. However, as a new family of 2D TMTs, the band alignments and heterostructures of IVB-VIA layered compounds, MX3 (M = Zr, Hf; X = S, Se), and VIIB-VIA layered compounds, MX2 (M = Tc, Re; X = S, Se), are relatively less studied.23 In-depth investigations on the applications of MX3 and MX2 are rare. Compared with conventional TMDs such as MoS2, there are extra X–X bands in trichalcogenide monolayer MX3, introducing states far below the Fermi level, which affects the electronic properties of MX3. The highly anisotropic nature of the layered structures gives MX3 and MX2 highly anisotropic effective masses and anisotropic physical properties.24,25 Through applying in-plane tensile strain, MX3 show excellent transport properties and could be used as high-performance thermoelectric (TE) materials.26 One significant property of VIIB-VIA 2D TMDs MX2 (M = Tc, Re; X = S, Se) is the existence of additional valence electrons, which make them display unique in-plane anisotropy in optical, electrical, and mechanical properties.27,28 The additional valence electrons also confine the charge of VIIB-VIA 2D TMDs MX2, and as there is no charge coupling between layers, they have different electronic properties from those of MoS2. Take ReS2 as an example; all kinds of ReS2 including bulk, few layer, and monolayer are direct band gap semiconductors. Such a vanishing interlayer coupling could overcome the challenge of preparing large-area, single-crystal monolayers.27 Furthermore, the band gaps of all IVB-VIA 2D TMTs MX3 and VIIB-VIA 2D TMDs MX2 are located in the visible-infrared region,25,29–32 so they could be applied in photocatalysis and photovoltaics.
In this paper, not only are the band gaps and work functions of monolayer IVB-VIA 2D TMTs MX3 and VIIB-VIA 2D TMDs MX2 calculated by universal density functional theory (DFT) with hybrid functionals, but their band alignments and the relevant physical origins of the band alignments are also investigated. For MX3, the edges of the valence band and conduction band depend mainly on the chalcogens and transition metal elements, respectively. However, for MX2, transition metal elements play an important role in both the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM). The characteristics of the band alignments relate not only to the electronegativity of chalcogens, but also to the reactivity of the outermost electron of transition metal elements, which influences the band gaps of the materials. The diverse positions of band edges and work functions of monolayer structures suggest that ZrS3, HfS3, TcSe2, and ReS2 have great potential for application in photocatalytic water splitting. In addition, the planar-averaged local density of states (DOS) of MX3 and MX2 thin-films suggest that they could be used for the development of type II heterostructures. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of MX3 thin-films is higher than that of some other common materials such as MoS2-based thin-films. The charge density differences of these heterostructures indicate that type II heterostructures composed of MX3 are more stable than those of MX2. This work could increase understanding of the properties and applications of IVB-VIA 2D TMTs MX3, VIIB-VIA 2D TMDs MX2, and related heterostructures.
2. Computational method
All the calculations on the band alignments of IVB-VIA 2D TMTs MX3 (M = Zr, Hf; X = S, Se) and VIIB-VIA 2D TMDs MX2 (M = Tc, Re; X = S, Se) are performed by the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)33,34 based on universal DFT with different kinds of van der Waals correction term as put forward by some groups,35–37 Grimme et al.,38 and Bučko et al.39–41 In addition, Quantum ESPRESSO code42 is utilized to perform qualitative analysis on the planar-averaged DOS of the interfaces of the materials. Projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudo-potentials43 are adopted to describe the electron–ion interactions, and the Green–Wannier (GW) version of the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) parameterization of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)44 as exchange correlation is used for all calculations. The cut off energy of the plane-wave basis set is 650 eV and the relaxation of energy is taken as 1.0 × 10−5 eV. The Hellmann–Feynman force between each atom is set to less than 0.01 eV Å−1. The 7 × 7 × 7 and 7 × 7 × 1 Monkhorst−Pack grids45 are utilized for sampling the Brillouin zones of both the bulk and monolayer MX3. In addition, the 5 × 5 × 5 and 5 × 5 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack grids are used for sampling the Brillouin zones of bulk and monolayer structures of MX2. For the calculations of the monolayer structures, a vacuum layer with a thickness of 20 Å is employed to avoid interactions between adjacent layers. All the calculated parameters adopted have been checked for the convergence of total energy and meet the stability and accuracy criteria. In consideration of the deficiency of traditional DFT which frequently underestimates the band gaps of semiconductors, the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional46 is utilized to obtain accurate band alignments of the materials.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Crystal structure and stability
IVB-VIA 2D TMTs MX3 are typical vdW-stacked layered structures.47 Transition metal elements are located between chalcogen atomic layers and form a sandwich structure. They crystallize with a monoclinic framework structure and their space group is P21/m, with two formula units per unit cell. The stable phase of VIIB-VIA 2D TMDs MX2 is a distorted octahedral (T) phase, whose overall symmetry is not hexagonal or rhombohedral. It appears that chalcogen layers are buckled and the metal atoms form zigzag chains along the direction of the lattice vector.48 The van der Waal's correction terms are necessary for accurate calculation of the lattice parameters of the materials, and also affect investigations on band alignments. In order to obtain the properties of the band alignments as accurately as possible, three different kinds of van der Waal's correction term including vdW-DF, vdW-D3 and vdW-TS/HI were utilized to relax the structures of materials. Then, the reasonable structures which were closest to the experimental results were chosen to simplify and construct monolayer structures for the calculations. Table S1 in the ESI† shows the relaxation results of VIIB-VIA 2D TMDs MX2 from three kinds of van der Waal's correction terms.
It was found that the lattice constants of relaxed structures of TcX2 (X = S, Se) based on vdW-D3 are closest to those from experimental measurement, while those of ReS2 based on vdW-TS/HI are closest to the experimental values. For TcX2, the lattice constants including values of a, b, and c increase when X changes from S to Se. In other words, the values of a, b, and c are proportional to the ionic radius of X. The different physical trends in c-vector between ReS2 and ReSe2 may be because the unit cell of ReS2 contains eight formula units while that of ReSe2 contains four formula units. The crystal structures of MX2 are illustrated in Fig. S1 in the ESI.†
For TMTs MX3 (M = Zr, Hf; X = S, Se), all the relaxation structures based on vdW-D3 are closest to the experimental results. Table S2 in ESI† shows the relaxation results of MX3 from three kinds of van der Waal's correction terms. Fig. S2 in the ESI† displays the crystal structures of MX3.
3.2 Band alignments of materials
Analysis of the band gap formation is based on calculations by PBE with spin–orbit coupling (PBE-SOC), and the features of their band alignments are illustrated with HSE06. Taking HfS3 and ReS2 as examples, the effect of different kinds of atom on the band gaps of monolayer MX2 and MX3 are analyzed. Fig. 1 illustrates the band structures of monolayer HfS3 and ReS2.

The effect of different kinds of atom on band structures is expressed in different colors in Fig. 1. Blue indicates that X (X = S, Se) atoms play a major role in the band whilst red indicates that M (M = Zr, Hf or Tc, Re) atoms play a major role in the band. The VBM and CBM of monolayer MX3 as shown in Fig. 1(a) depend mainly on the chalcogens and transition metal elements, respectively. However, both VBM and CBM depend on the transition metal elements in monolayer MX2, as shown in Fig. 1(b). The relationship between the density of states (DOS) of monolayer HfS3 and ReS2 is analyzed in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 2  (a) and (b) The DOS of Hf and S in monolayer HfS3. (c) and (d) The DOS of Re and S in monolayer ReS2. 
It was found that the p states of sulfur form the main part of the VBM in HfS3, and the d states of Hf mainly affect the CBM (Fig. 2(a) and (b)). For monolayer ReS2, it is the interaction of chalcogens and transition metal elements that leads to the change in levels of Re d states and constitutes the VBM and CBM of monolayer ReS2 (Fig. 2(c) and (d)). These characteristics are obviously different from some other monolayer TMDs MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) as both their VBM and CBM result from hybridization of the states of sulfur atoms with the d-states of the transition metal atoms.49 The band gaps of monolayer MX3 and MX2 as calculated by PBE-SOC are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1 shows that the work functions of monolayer MX3 are about 5.1–5.6 eV, and those of MX2 are in the range of 4.4–5.5 eV. There have been reports that monolayer VIB-TMDs MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se) are in the range of 4–5 eV and IVB-TMDs MX2 (M = Zr, Hf; X = S, Se) are approximately 6 eV.19 Therefore, the materials mentioned above are able to form many kinds of junctions, which can be used for electronic devices such as tunnel field effect transistors (TFETs).
The band alignment features of monolayer MX3 and MX2 are shown in Fig. 3. With respect to the vacuum level, the standard water redox potentials are −4.44 eV and −5.67 eV for reduction (H+/H2) and oxidation (O2/H2O), respectively.50 The standard water redox potentials are also shown in Fig. 3 with dashed lines.

It is known that monolayer structures could be excellent candidates for photocatalytic water splitting once they meet the following conditions. First of all, their band gaps should be greater than 1.23 eV, as this will not only drive the kinetics of hydrogen, but also promote the oxygen evolution reaction. Concurrently, the band gaps have to be smaller than 3.00 eV to enhance the absorption of solar radiation. Secondly, the VBM and CBM of the materials are required to be lower than the potential of oxidation (O2/H2O) and higher than the potential of (H+/H2), respectively. From these criteria, ZrS3, HfS3, TcSe2, and ReS2 could be regarded as promising materials for photocatalytic water splitting, as shown in Fig. 3. The value of the band gap mainly depends on the electronegativity of the chalcogens, which can affect the intralayer bonding.51 When X goes from S to Se, the electronegativity of the chalcogen decreases, causing the intralayer bonding to weaken, and consequently, the band gap decreases. Hence, the band gaps of common-M systems change due to the decrease in electronegativity of chalcogens as atomic number increases. It can be inferred from Fig. 2 that the positions of the VBM and CBM depend on the interaction between the p states of sulfur and the d states of transition metal atoms. P states become shallower when the ionic radius of the chalcogen increases, which can push the d states of transition metal atoms upwards. Meanwhile, the bond length of M–X will increase, which could weaken their interaction. For IVB-VIA TMTs MX3, the bond length may play a dominant role. Hence, the position of the CBM would decline and that of the VBM would rise when the atomic number of the chalcogen increases. For VIIB-VIA TMDs MX2, the interaction between the p states of the chalcogens and the d states of the transition metal atoms may play the leading role. As a consequence, both CBM and VBM increase with an increase in the ionic radius of X. Compared with the band alignment of VIB-TMDs MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) and IVB-TMDs MX2 (M = Zr, Hf; X = S, Se) which is a broken-gap band alignment,19 the gaps in band alignments of MX3 (M = Zr, Hf; X = S, Se) and MX2 (M = Tc, Re; X = S, Se) change gently. This means that there may be more choices for preparing the same type of heterostructures.
3.3 Electronic structures of staggered gap heterostructures formed by IVB-VIA TMTs and VIIB-VIA TMDs
Because free electrons and holes would be spontaneously separated in staggered gap (type II) heterostructures, they could play an important role in optoelectronics and solar energy conversion.52 Therefore, the properties of type II heterostructures attract broad attention and have been extensively studied. In Fig. 3, it can be seen that the relative positions of the band edges of these materials meet the essential conditions for the formation of type II heterostructures. Henceforth, electronic structures of thin films formed by ZrS3/HfS3 and TcS2/ReS2 are taken as an examples for further investigation. The vacuum gaps of the heterostructures and the calculation parameters we utilized are displayed in the ESI.†Fig. 4 shows the structures, electronic properties, local planar-averaged DOS and charge density differences of both the ZrS3/HfS3 and TcS2/ReS2 thin film. The vacuum gaps of the heterostructures and calculation parameters are introduced in the ESI.†

(g) and (h) The charge density differences for ZrS3/HfS3 and TcS2/ReS2 heterostructures. The red section and blue section represent charge accumulation and charge dissipation, respectively. 
ZrS3 and TcS2 are the bottom materials shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b). For convenience, the lattice constants of ZrS3/HfS3 and TcS2/ReS2 are same as ZrS2 and TcS2, respectively. Fig. 4(c) and (d) illustrate the electronic properties of ZrS3/HfS3 and TcS2/ReS2. Along the lines connecting high-symmetry points, both ZrS3 and HfS3 play an important role in every energy band of ZrS3/HfS3. The VBM and CBM depend on HfS3 and ZrS3, respectively. For TcS2/ReS2, almost every band relies only on a single material (either TcS2 or ReS2). The first valence band is decided by ReS2 and the first conduction band is decided by TcS2. The band gaps of ZrS3/HfS3 and TcS2/ReS2 are 0.98 eV and 0.92 eV, respectively, which are lower than that of any other compositions (the band gaps of ZrS3, HfS3, TcS2 and ReS2 are 1.13 eV, 1.08 eV, 1.28 eV and 1.36 eV, respectively). This suggests that constructing bilayer materials could be viewed as an effective method for band tunability. The decrease in band gaps may be caused by the change of thickness of the ingredients and vdW interactions between the two monolayer materials. It is reported that for some TMDs such as MoS2, the band gaps are sensitive to their thickness.53,54 The emergence of vdW interactions could lead to the increasing number of antibonding states formed by the pz orbitals of the chalcogen and dz2 of the transition metal element.55 As a consequence, the value of the band gaps decrease. Qualitative calculations on the local planar-averaged DOS of ZrS3/HfS3 and TcS2/ReS2 are shown in Fig. 4(e) and (f). It was found that the value of local planar-averaged DOS for their interfaces is not zero. Combined with the properties of their band alignments, one conclusion is that ZrS3/HfS3 and TcS2/ReS2 interfaces allow type-II staggered gap heterostructures. Therefore, they are candidates for photovoltaic applications. Fig. 4(g) and (h) display the charge density difference for forming ZrS3/HfS3 and TcS2/ReS2 thin films, respectively. The red area indicates an accumulation of charge while the blue area indicates a dissipation of charge. For ZrS3/HfS3, the charge mainly gathers at the interface, while for TcS2/ReS2, charge mainly gathers inside the materials, with little at the interface. Moreover, the crystal structural symmetry and lattice constants of the thin films suggest that the degree of lattice mismatch among the IVB-VIA monolayer TMTs is lower than that of VIIB-VIA monolayer TMDs. This suggests that the interaction in the heterostructures formed of IVB-VIA TMTs is stronger than in those formed from VIIB-VIA TMDs, and the stability of the former is higher than that of the latter.
3.4 PCE of photovoltaic cells formed by IVB-VIA TMTs and VIIB-VIA TMDs
The threshold value of PCE η under conditions of 100% external quantum efficiency can be expressed by the following formula:56–58  where 0.65 is the parameter of the band-fill factor. Edg is the band gap of donor materials. ΔEc is the band offset of the CBM of the components. The (Edg − ΔEc − 0.3) term is the maximum estimation of open circuit voltage. Jph(ħω) indicates the AM 1.5 solar energy flux at the photon energy ħω, the unit of which is W m−2 eV−1. The integral in the numerator is the short circuit current Jsc. Fig. 5(a) and (b) display the band offsets of components and the skeleton map of PEC, respectively. Horizontal coordinates indicate the value of the band gap of the donor and vertical coordinates indicate the band offset of the CBM of the components. The results suggest that the PCE of ZrS3/HfS3 bilayer thin film could reach approximately 16–18%, which is higher than those of both MoS2/WS2 (12–14%) and MoSe2/WSe2 (14–16%).20 However, the PCE of TcS2/ReS2 is approximately 8–10%. It has been reported that PCE is related to dipole transitions among large joint density of states and oscillator strengths between localized d states which show strong spatial overlap.16,59 For monolayer MX3, symmetry-breaking results in not only spin–orbit (SO) splitting which promotes dipole transitions, but also excitonic effects60 which could improve the oscillator strengths. However, SO splitting and excitonic effects are weak in monolayer MX2, as there is inversion symmetry in monolayer structures.61 As a consequence, the PCE of MX3 heterostructures is higher than that of MX2 heterostructures. Fig. 5(c) is a schematic of a thin-film solar cell with fluoride-doped tin oxide (FTO) transparent conductive glass electrodes. Once photons are absorbed in type II heterostructures, electron transition could happen between donor and acceptor.

Conclusions
In summary, investigation into the band alignments, work functions, local planar-averaged DOS and PCEs of IVB-VIA monolayer TMTs MX3 (M = Zr, Hf and X = S, Se) and VIIB-VIA monolayer TMDs MX2 (M = Tc, Re and X = S, Se) shows that these materials could be regarded as favorable candidates for photocatalytic water splitting, optoelectronic devices and solar energy conversion. For monolayer MX3, the VBM is dominated by chalcogens and the CBM is dominated by transition metal elements. The band gap of MX3 is made up of the p states of the chalcogens and the d states of the transition metal elements. Compared with MX3, both the VBM and the CBM of MX2 are dominated by the d states of the transition metal elements. Because of the decreasing electronegativity, the band gaps of MX3 and MX2 would decrease when X goes from S to Se. The trend in band alignments of monolayer MX2 is different from that of MX3. It is the reason why interactions between electronic orbits play a more important role in MX3, while bond length plays a dominant role in MX2. Besides, the heterostructures of IVB-VIA monolayer TMTs MX3 are more stable than those composed of VIIB-VIA monolayer TMDs MX2, which is the result of the different strengths of van der Waals interactions caused by different degrees of lattice mismatch.
