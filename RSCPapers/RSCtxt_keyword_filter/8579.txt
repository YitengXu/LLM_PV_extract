Here, two new nonfullerene acceptors, namely M1 and M4, are developed to investigate the synergistic effect of side-chains and end-groups on the photovoltaic properties of nonfullerene acceptors. Compared with M1 with nonfluorinated end-groups and shorter side-chains, M4 exhibits a red-shifted absorption, lowered energy levels, more ordered molecular packing and increased crystallinity due to its longer side-chains as well as fluorinated end-groups. Moreover, when blended with the polymer donor of PM6, the M4-based blend shows an enhanced face-on molecular orientation and more favorable phase separation in comparison with the M1-based counterpart thereby leading to increased charge carrier mobilities and decreased charge recombination for the PSCs based on M4. As a consequence, a significantly enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.75% with an increased short-circuit current density of 23.44 mA cm−2 and a fill factor of 71.52% is achieved for the M4-based devices outperforming that of the M1-based devices (PCE = 8.06%). This study provides an important strategy to improve the photovoltaic properties of nonfullerene acceptors.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) can be a novel type of power supply in portable electronics and building-integrated photovoltaic systems considering their merits of good portability, flexibility, non-toxicity, semitransparency, light-weight, and low-cost by solution processing.1–6 As the key component of PSCs, the active layer usually adopts a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) structure, which can be prepared by blending a donor material with an acceptor material. In the early stages of organic photovoltaic research, fullerene derivatives are dominant acceptor materials, and the corresponding best-performance PSCs could deliver power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 11%.7–9 However, it becomes a tremendous challenge to further improve the performance of fullerene-based PSCs with PCEs beyond 12% considering the relatively fixed bandgaps as well as energy levels of the fullerene derivatives. Therefore, nonfullerene acceptors are emerging among which acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type nonfullerene acceptors are the most investigated.10 Compared with traditional fullerene derivatives, these nonfullerene acceptors not only exhibit stronger and broader absorption bands, but also show wide-range tunable energy levels thereby leading to solar cells with reduced energy losses.11–13 In combination with appropriate donor materials and suitable device optimizations, PCEs of nonfullerene-based PSCs are much higher than those of state-of-the-art fullerene-based PSCs.14–21
Generally, A–D–A type fused-ring electron acceptors have three basic components: a ladder-type fused-ring core, out-of-plane side-chains, and two electron-withdrawing end-groups.22,23 The three components can be tailored independently, thus providing great flexibility and convenience to adjust the optical and electronic properties of the target nonfullerene acceptors.24 The fused-ring core is important for non-fullerene acceptors because it not only affects their energy levels and bandgaps, but also governs their intermolecular interactions and molecular orientations.25,26 At the same time, end-groups and side-chains are the other two important components that cannot be neglected. Although alkyl chains were only thought to be insulating groups to increase solubility, recent studies showed that for nonfullerene acceptors based on a given fused-ring core, side-chain engineering can be used to further improve their photovoltaic performance.27 There are some successful examples on the side-chain engineering of nonfullerene acceptors in recent years.28–36 For example, our group reported that replacing the linear hexyl chains on the dithienonaphthalene-based nonfullerene acceptor (DTNIC6) with the branched 2-ethylhexyl chains (DTNIC8) led to an improved BHJ film morphology thereby leading to a PCE improvement from 3.22% to 8.72%.37 Bo and co-workers found that the introduction of asymmetric alkyl chains improved the intermolecular packing and electron mobility of the resulting acceptor (IDT-OB). When combined with a donor polymer of PBDB-T, PCEs of the corresponding devices increased from 6.42% to 10.12%.38 On the other hand, the functionalization of end-groups, especially fluorination on the end-groups, has also been proven to be a simple and effective strategy for modulating the energy levels, bandgaps, and intermolecular interaction of nonfullerene acceptors.39 For instance, the benchmark nonfullerene acceptor, IT4F, was developed by the fluorination of ITIC in the end-groups.40 IT4F shows a red-shifted absorption, a larger absorption coefficient and a higher electron mobility than ITIC thereby leading to an increased short-circuit current density (JSC) over 20 mA cm−2 and an enhanced PCE over 13% when blended with a wide bandgap polymer of PBDB-T-SF.40 As has been demonstrated above, to further improve the performance of nonfullerene acceptors, both end-groups and side-chains should be specially designed. Thus, the study of the synergistic effect of side-chain engineering and end-group fluorination is of great importance in the organic photovoltaic field.
Very recently, our group reported a promising class of A–D–A type nonfullerene acceptors by using a novel ladder-type heteroheptacene core which is free of sp3 carbon-bonded side-chains.41,42 The effect of the heterocycles in the electron-donating core on the resultant nonfullerene acceptors was first investigated.41 It was found that replacing the furan rings in the electron-donating core (M8) with thiophene rings (M34) increased the aromaticity index of the acceptor, which in turn led to a blue-shifted absorption and a down-shifted HOMO energy level. Moreover, this replacement induced a higher tendency for face-on molecular orientation in the blend film. As a result, the M34-based device showed a higher PCE of 15.24% than 4.21% for the M8-based counterpart.41 The optimization of lateral alkyl chains was then performed on the heteroheptacene core, and we found that both large-size and small-size alkyl side-chains lead to increased intermolecular π–π stacking distances, thus hindering efficient electron transport and reducing the efficiency of the corresponding PSCs.42 However, the effect of fluorination on the end-groups, especially when combined with side-chain engineering, on the properties of these heteroheptacene-based nonfullerene acceptors has not been investigated, and it shall be useful for developing high-performance nonfullerene acceptors.
Our group has previously designed and synthesized a nonfullerene acceptor based on the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]bis(4-H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole) (BDTPT) core (M2) with 2-ethylhexyl side-chains and fluorinated end-groups in the terminals.42 With its relatively poor solubility and excessive aggregation in the blend film, M2 only delivered a moderate PCE of 11.16%. In this work, we present two new nonfullerene acceptors (M1 and M4) by using the same electron-donating core of BDTPT to investigate the synergistic effect of side-chain engineering and end-group fluorination on the BDTPT-based nonfullerene acceptors. Among the three nonfullerene acceptors shown in Fig. 1, M1 and M2 have the same alkyl chains of 2-ethylhexyl in the BDTPT core but with different end-groups of 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IC) and fluorinated IC (IC2F), respectively. Conversely, M2 and M4 share the same end-group of IC2F, but they differ in the alkyl chains on the oxygen atoms in the BDTPT core (2-ethylhexyl for M2, 2-butyloctyl for M4). The photophysical, electrochemical, molecular orientation, crystallinity, charge transport and photovoltaic properties of the two new nonfullerene acceptors (M1 and M4) were studied and compared with those of M2. Combined with a wide bandgap polymer donor of PM6, the best-performance device based on M4 showed a much higher PCE of 14.75%, with a JSC of 23.44 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.88 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 71.52%, which is higher than that of the M1-based counterpart (PCE = 8.06%) as well as that of the M2-based counterpart (PCE = 11.16%) we reported previously.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of acceptors
The synthetic routes to M1 and M4 are depicted in Scheme 1. The key dialdehyde intermediates, 1a and 1b, were prepared using the procedure reported by our group previously.41,42 To obtain the target nonfullerene acceptors, the aldehyde compound 1a (or compound 1b) was reacted under Knoevenagel condensation conditions with an 8-fold excess of IC (IC2F) in 86% (or 82%) yield. Note that the synthesis of M4 was carried out at a relatively lower reaction temperature than that of M1 due to the higher reactivity of IC2F. The specific synthetic procedures and structural characterization data are described in the ESI.† Both acceptors can be dissolved in common organic solvents such as chloroform and chlorobenzene, which ensures that the material purification and device fabrication can proceed smoothly.

Optical and electrochemical properties
The absorption spectra of M1 and M4 in chloroform solutions (5 × 10−6 M) and thin films are shown in Fig. 2 and their optical data are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2a, both the acceptors exhibit strong absorption bands ranging from 600 to 800 nm in chloroform solutions, which is mainly ascribed to the strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect between the BDTPT core and the end-groups. Especially, in comparison with M2, M4 exhibits very similar optical properties (Table 1) in both the solution and thin-film state, suggesting a negligible effect of side-chains on the absorption and bandgaps of the nonfullerene acceptors. Compared to M1, M4 shows a 16 nm redshifted absorption spectrum in solution indicating that the introduction of the more electronegative fluorine atoms into the end-groups enhances the ICT from the central electron-donating core to the end-groups. In addition, M4 features a slightly higher extinction coefficient (2.35 × 105 M−1 cm−1) than M1 (2.25 × 105 M−1 cm−1) in solution. In going from solution to thin films, distinctly red-shifted and broadened spectra are observed for both the acceptors, suggesting their strong aggregation behaviors in the solid state. Especially, the absorption peak for M4 in thin films exhibits a bathochromic shift of 56 nm in comparison with that in solution. However, in the case of M1, a relatively smaller value of 48 nm is observed which indicates a stronger intermolecular interaction of the acceptor with the fluorinated end-groups (M4). The optical bandgaps of M1 and M4, estimated from their absorption onsets in thin films, are 1.44, and 1.38 eV, respectively. Both the nonfullerene acceptors have complementary absorption bands with the benchmark polymer of PM6 which has a strong absorption band at 300–700 nm (Fig. 2b).

The electrochemical energy levels of M1 and M4 in thin films were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Fig. 2c presents the CV curves of two nonfullerene acceptors, and Table 1 summarizes the corresponding data. The onset reduction/oxidation potentials (φred/φox) for M1 and M4 versus Ag/Ag+ were measured to be −1.02/0.66 and −0.85/0.79 V, respectively. According to the formula of ELUMO/EHOMO = −(φred/φox + 4.82) eV, the corresponding lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels were calculated to be −3.80/−5.48 and −3.97/−5.61 eV for M1 and M4, respectively. In comparison with M2 (Table 1), one may find that the alkyl chains have little effect on the energy levels of the resulting acceptors, and the introduction of the more electronegative fluorine atoms could lower the energy levels, especially for the LUMO levels of the resulting nonfullerene acceptors. With the up-shifted LUMO level of M1, M1-based PSCs are expected to have enlarged VOC values. Photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiments were then conducted to investigate the photo-induced charge transfer in the blend films. As displayed in Fig. S1,† the PL intensity of PM6 is significantly quenched in both the PM6:M1 and the PM6:M4 blend films, indicating efficient electron transfer from PM6 to both the acceptors. However, compared to the PL spectra of their pure acceptor films, the PM6:M4 blend film displays a much higher PL quenching efficiency than the PM6:M1 blend film. This means that the hole transfer from M1 to PM6 is not efficient due to the negative HOMO offset (−0.02 eV) between PM6 and M1.
Theoretical calculations
The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-311G** level to illuminate the fluorination effect on the energy levels, the molecular geometries and the surface electrostatic potentials (ESPs) of the nonfullerene acceptors. In order to simplify the calculations, all long branched alkyl chains were replaced by shorter isobutyl groups. As shown in Fig. S2,† the acceptors in this work possess nearly planar and linear backbone configurations (side and top views, respectively), which would help to shorten the intermolecular π–π stacking distance thus improving the charge carrier mobility. Moreover, the two acceptors exhibit similar wave function distributions in Frontier orbitals, i.e., the electron densities of LUMO levels are delocalized along the whole molecular backbones while the electron densities of HOMO levels are more localized at the donor segments. With the fluorination, the calculated HOMO/LUMO levels were down-shifted from −5.70/−3.50 eV to −5.77/−3.66 eV (as shown in Fig. 3), which are consistent with the results from the CV measurements.

The ESP distributions of the two simplified molecular models of M1 and M4 on their van der Waals surfaces were further investigated. It can be found that the positive ESP of M1 is mainly distributed at the BDTPT core and the non-conjugated alkyl groups while the negative ESP is located mainly on the strong electronegative groups like carbonyl and cyano groups. As for M4, negative ESPs are also located on the functional groups with strong electronegative atoms, but the positive ESP regions are extended from the donor core to the end-groups. The larger distributed positive ESP will induce a stronger intermolecular electric field between M4 and the polymer donor PM6, which can help to enhance intermolecular interactions and facilitates charge generation.43
GIWAXS measurement of pure acceptor films
Grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was employed to investigate the molecular stacking and crystallization behaviors of the two acceptors. The 2D GIWAXS patterns and 1D cut-line profiles are shown in Fig. 4 and corresponding parameters are summarized in Table S1.† It was found that both M1 and M4 in neat films display a (010) diffraction peak in the qz direction and a (100) diffraction peak in the qxy direction, indicating that both the acceptor molecules prefer a face-on orientation with respect to the substrate, which is the same as M2. Undoubtedly, the face-on molecular orientation is beneficial for efficient charge transport in the vertical direction across PSC devices. For M1, the (010) and (100) diffraction peaks are located at 1.74 and 0.35 Å−1, corresponding to a π–π stacking distance of 3.61 Å and a lamellar stacking distance of 17.84 Å, respectively. According to the Scherrer equation, the coherence lengths (CLs) of these two diffraction peaks were calculated to be 0.93 and 3.95 nm, respectively. After the replacement of the 2-ethylhexyl side-chains with 2-butyloctyl side-chains on the oxygen atoms and the hydrogen atoms with fluorine atoms on the end-groups, the (010) diffraction peak of M4 film shifted to 1.80 Å−1 in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, suggesting a decreased π–π stacking distance of 3.48 Å. At the same time, the CLs calculated from the (010) and (100) diffraction peaks for M4 increased to 2.68 and 6.21 nm, respectively. It can be easily calculated that the CL of the (010) peak for M4 corresponds to around 7.7 molecular layers of the π–π stacking. However, for the M1-based counterpart, only 2.6 molecular layers of the π–π stacking are observed. These results indicate that the combination of end-group fluorination and side-chain engineering leads to the nonfullerene acceptor (M4) with an enhanced molecular packing order as well as a slightly reduced π–π stacking distance.

Photovoltaic performance
The photovoltaic performances of the two acceptors were investigated by fabricating BHJ PSCs with a conventional device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/2,9-bis(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)anthra[2,1,9-def:6,5,10-d′e′f']diisoquinoline−1,3,8,10(2H,9H)-tetraone (PDIN)/Ag, where PM6 was selected as the donor polymer due to its complementary absorption with the acceptors and PDIN was used as the cathode interface layer.44 Device fabrication conditions, such as the donor:acceptor weight ratio, the amounts of 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) additive, and the thermal annealing temperature, were optimized to maximize the device performance. The detailed device parameters of PSCs fabricated under different conditions are listed in Tables S2–S4 (ESI†). The optimal active layers were prepared at a donor:acceptor weight ratio of 1:1, a total concentration of 16 mg mL−1 in chloroform, 0.5% (volume) of CN, and a thermal annealing temperature of 90 °C for 5 min. Fig. 5 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the best-performance devices based on PM6:M1 and PM6:M4, and Table 2 lists the corresponding photovoltaic parameters.

Under the optimal conditions, the best-performance PM6:M1-based PSC yielded a moderate PCE of 8.06% with a VOC of 1.01 V, a JSC of 14.59 mA cm−2, and a FF of 54.68%. For the devices based on M4, despite a lower VOC of 0.88 V, the simultaneously improved values in JSC (23.44 mA cm−2) and FF (71.52%) boosted the overall PCE to 14.75%. Obviously, the incorporation of fluorine atoms on the end-groups of M1 leads to a decrease in VOC, which is reasonable considering the down-shifted LUMO energy levels. To study the repeatability of PSCs based on each acceptor, 20 devices from three different batches were fabricated to obtain the average PCEs and the corresponding standard deviations. The results are listed in Table 2 and the corresponding statistical distribution histograms of PCEs are displayed in Fig. 5b. The results indicate the good reproducibility of PSCs based on both acceptors. It should be mentioned that another benchmark donor polymer of PBDB-T with an elevated HOMO energy level was also used to pair with M1 (Table S5†). In the polymer blend system of PBDB-T:M1, the HOMO offset is large enough for M1. Thus, the best-performance device based on PBDB-T:M1 showed a higher PCE of 10.17% than the PM6:M1-based counterpart (8.06%).
External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were then carried out to confirm the JSC values obtained from the J–V curves. As displayed in Fig. 5c, the best-performance M4-based device exhibits a strong photo response in the range of 300–900 nm, obviously higher and broader than that of the M1-based device. This is consistent with the absorption spectrum tendency of M1 and M4 films (in Fig. 2b). The integrated JSC values from the EQE spectra of the M1 and M4-based PSCs (Fig. 5d) were calculated to be 14.32 and 22.39 mA cm−2, respectively, which agree with the JSC values obtained from the J–V measurements within 5% errors.
To explore the reason for the different photovoltaic performances of M1 and M4, we evaluated the charge transport, extraction and recombination behaviors of photo-generated charges in the corresponding devices. The hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities were calculated by fitting the dark current density using the space charge limited current (SCLC) model. The hole-only and electron-only diodes with architectures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag and ITO/ZnO/active layer/Ca/Al, respectively, were fabricated to measure the dark current density. The J–V characteristics are shown in Fig. 6c and d and the corresponding μh and μe values are listed in Table 2. For the PM6:M1 blend film, the μh and μe were estimated to be 4.46 × 10−4 and 8.10 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with a high μh/μe ratio of 5.51. By contrast, the PM6:M4 blend displayed a higher μh of 7.38 × 10−4 and μe of 4.17 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a more balanced μh/μe ratio of 1.77, all of which are favorable for inhibiting the charge recombination and improving the JSC value in the PM6:M4-based devices.

To gain insight into the charge generation properties of the PSCs with M1 and M4 as the acceptors, the relationship between the photocurrent density (Jph) and the effective voltage (Veff) was investigated. As shown in Fig. 6a, the Jph increased continuously with the increase of Veff in the low Veff region, and then saturated (Jsat) when Veff approached 2 V, which means that the charge generation and collection in the PSC device are both effective. The exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss) can be assessed by the Jph/Jsat ratio. Under the short-circuit condition, the Pdiss values for the PM6:M1 and PM6:M4-based devices are 83.19% and 93.46%, respectively. Obviously, the probability of exciton dissociation of the PM6:M1-based PSC was smaller than that of the PM6:M4-based counterpart, which is consistent with the lower JSC and FF values for the PM6:M1-based device. Furthermore, to track the charge recombination kinetics in the M1-and M4-based devices, we measured the J–V curves under different light intensities (P). The relationship between JSC and P can be described as the formula of JSC ∝ PS, in which S is an exponential factor that represents the bimolecular recombination degree. When all free carriers are swept out with negligible recombination, the S value in the equation approaches 1.45 The plots of JSCversus P for the PSCs based on M1 and M4 are drawn in a double logarithmic scale and shown in Fig. 6b. The S values are 0.89 and 0.95 for the devices based on M1 and M4, respectively, suggesting the weaker bimolecular recombination of the M4-based device therefore its higher JSC value in comparison with the M1-based counterpart.
Blend film morphology
The morphology of the photoactive layer has a great influence on the final device performance. Here, atomic force microscopy (AFM) in trapping mode was carried out to characterize the surface morphologies of these blend films (Fig. S3†). As shown in AFM height images, both PM6:M1 and PM6:M4 blend films show a smooth surface morphology with small root-mean-square roughnesses of 0.91 and 1.07 nm, respectively, suggesting good miscibility between the two acceptors and PM6. The slight increase in the roughness of the PM6:M4 blend film may be correlated with its high crystallinity. From the AFM phase image, slightly enhanced phase separation was observed for the PM6:M4 blend which could be beneficial for its more efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport thereby resulting in its higher JSC and FF values.
GIWAXS was employed to investigate the molecular packing behaviors of the two blend films. For comparison, the molecular orientation and ordering behaviors of the neat PM6 film were also measured. The 2D patterns of the PM6 neat film and two blend films as well as the extracted 1D profiles are shown in Fig. 7. Similar to the previously reported results,41 the polymer donor PM6 mainly adopts a face-on orientation. The (010) peak is located at qz = 1.69 Å−1 (corresponds to a π–π stacking distance of 3.71 Å) in the OOP direction with a CL of 1.06 nm (estimated via the Scherrer equation), while the lamellar stacking (100) peak is located at qxy = 0.29 Å−1 (corresponds to a d-spacing of 21.58 Å) in the in-plane direction (IP) with a CL of 6.28 nm. After blending the two acceptors separately with PM6, both blend films showed combined diffraction features of the corresponding single-component materials. From the 2D patterns shown in Fig. 7a and b, we can find that the two blends display different molecular stacking features. In the PM6:M1 blend film, weak π–π stacking diffractions appeared along both the OOP and the IP directions, suggesting that edge-on and face-on crystallites co-exist in the blend film. This is consistent with its low electron mobility discussed in the previous section. The (010) diffraction peak in the OOP direction was located at approximately qz = 1.70 Å−1, corresponding to a π–π stacking distance of 3.69 Å. Moreover, the corresponding CL of the π–π stacking structure was estimated to be 1.22 nm. Interestingly, with the combination of side-chain engineering and end-group fluorination, the molecules in the PM6:M4 blend adapt face-on orientation more predominantly than those in the PM6:M1 counterpart, which is beneficial for efficient charge transport in the vertical direction of the PM6:M4-based device as demonstrated by the SCLC measurements. Moreover, similar to the variation in the pure acceptor films, the PM6:M4 blend film exhibited a better ordered molecular packing with an increased (010) CL of 1.54 nm and a decreased π–π stacking distance of 3.58 Å compared to the PM6:M1 blend film, which consequently assists the enhanced charge transport and improves the JSC and FF values for the M4-based PSCs. In general, the differences in molecular orientation and crystallinity of the two blend films are well correlated with their charge carrier mobilities and photovoltaic properties.

Conclusions
In summary, two A–D–A type nonfullerene acceptors, namely, M1 and M4, were designed and synthesized by using a ladder-type heteroheptacene as the donor core. The synergistic effect of end-group fluorination and side-chain engineering on the optical properties, energy levels, molecular orientation behaviors, carrier transport, thin-film morphology and photovoltaic performances of the nonfullerene acceptors was systematically investigated. It was found that with suitable alkyl chains and fluorinated end-groups, M4 exhibited red-shifted absorption bands, down-shifted energy levels and enhanced π–π stacking and crystallinity, which allow for its more complementary absorption and better matched energy levels with PM6. Compared with the blend film based on PM6:M1, the PM6:M4 blend film tended to form a more ordered molecular packing with a larger population of face-on orientation. These favorable factors lead to enhanced charge transport and decreased charge recombination in the PM6:M4-based devices. As a result, the best-performance PM6:M4-based PSC showed a higher PCE of 14.75% compared to those based on PM6:M1 (8.06%) and PM6:M2 (11.16%) that we reported previously. Our results demonstrate that the synergistic effect of end-group fluorination and side-chain engineering can broaden the absorption bands and enhance the molecular packing order of the resulting nonfullerene acceptors thereby leading to improved charge transport and enhanced photovoltaic performance.
