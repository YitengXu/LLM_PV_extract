    , Accepted 23rd July 2018First published on 24th July 2018AbstractWe report on the preparation and performance of catalysts from earth abundant materials and their implementation in a stand-alone photovoltaic-electrochemical (PV-EC) module with 64 cm2 active area. NiFeOX as the oxygen evolution reaction catalyst and NiMo as the hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst were electrodeposited on nickel sheets. We compare the NiFeOX/NiMo catalysts to a noble metal catalyst system consisting of IrOX and Pt regarding their potential for upscaling to large areas and their application and performance in the PV-EC module with a triple junction thin film silicon based solar cell. Additionally, we present long-term stability measurements of the catalyst systems (i) NiMo/NiFeOX and (ii) Ni/Ni under simulated day-night cycles. Overall, we show the feasibility of using earth abundant catalysts in an upscaled stand-alone PV-EC module. The NiMo/NiFeOX catalyst pair outperforms the precious metal catalysts with a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of ηSTH(NiMo/NiFeOX) = 5.1% (ηSTH(Pt/IrOX) = 4.8%) and shows an excellent long-term stability in the simulated day-night cycles.
Introduction
One promising approach to generate hydrogen as a renewable fuel and energy storage medium1,2 is solar driven water splitting using integrated photovoltaic-biased electrosynthetic3 (PV-EC) devices. In such a device a photovoltaic (PV) cell is directly connected with an electrochemical (EC) cell. In order to perform the electrolysis of H2O, the illuminated PV cell has to deliver a voltage that exceeds the thermodynamic water splitting potential of Ethermo = 1.23 V plus electrode overpotentials Eover (Etotal > 1.5 V). Thin film silicon multi-junction cells are well suited to obtain such high output voltages and at the same time make effective use of the solar spectrum. Thereby they deliver high photocurrents at the operation point and thus high solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiencies. The electrically and optically optimized silicon multi-junctions can provide open circuit voltages (VOC) in the range of 1.5 to 2.8 V, depending on the number of sub cells connected in series.4 We investigated PV-EC devices employing different types of thin film silicon multi-junction cells and reported on a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency ηSTH of 9.5% for a triple junction solar cell. The cell stack consisted of sub cells made of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H)/hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H)/hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon (μc-Si:H) absorber layers; together with platinum and ruthenium oxide as catalysts in alkaline media. In this configuration the size of the photocathode was below 1 cm2. Subsequently, the upscaling of the device area was investigated. We reported on different approaches and concepts using thin film silicon solar cells to increase the solar cell's active area5,6 as well as a modular device for the evaluation of photoabsorbers and catalysts.5 For an active area of 64 cm2 solar-to-hydrogen efficiencies ηSTH = 4.8% and ηSTH = 2.1% were reported for noble metal based Pt/IrOX and for earth abundant Ni/Ni catalyst systems, respectively.
However, for such an integrated PV-EC system to be a large area stand-alone device for efficient generation of hydrogen from sunlight, a number of scientific and technological challenges have still to be met. Among these are, besides the obvious increase in efficiency and scale-up of area, the stability under long-term operation, cost, which to a large extent is related to the choice of materials for catalysts, and ease of preparation for the individual components and the entire systems.
In the present work we address these challenges based on our previously reported PV-EC cassette system5 with an active solar cell area of 8 × 8 cm2. Our focus was on the preparation and application of catalyst materials from earth abundant components for both the hydrogen- and the oxygen-evolution reaction side, the stability of the system under extended simulated day-night cycle operation, and the solar-to-hydrogen efficiency.
For the choice of catalyst materials we have consulted the extensive research activities on the development of catalysts and their integration into water splitting devices or electrolyzers as reported in the literature,7–15 considering the simplicity of preparation and the use for the targeted electrode area of 50.3 cm2 for the modular cassette device. Promising alternatives to the precious metal catalysts exist especially in the alkaline media.7,15 For the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) side, materials based on nickel or cobalt show overpotentials similar to iridium oxide, ruthenium oxide and platinum, respectively.7,12,15–19 The reported overpotentials are in the range of 0.34–0.47 V (OER) and between −0.07 to −0.30 V for the HER side.7,20
Based on these reports we chose NiFeOX for the OER side and NiMo for the HER side.7,20 Both materials have been studied intensively and different synthesis routes14,19,21,22 as well as extensive characterization concerning not only the electrochemical properties7,13,14,16,21,22 but also the structure and mechanism16,23,24 have been carried out. Fang et al. have shown that these two materials, NiMo and NiFeOX, hydrothermally deposited on nickel foam can be combined in an alkaline electrolyzer without any performance loss due to the use of earth abundant catalysts compared to noble metal catalysts.14 In contrast to the application in electrolyzers (typical operation current density JOP in A cm−2 range22), the current density in a PV-EC device is limited by the solar cell and its current density. The current densities delivered by solar cells, which generate a voltage >1.5 V, are usually between 6–9 mA cm−2 at the operation point.4,25,26 Therefore, in this respect the requirements for the catalysts employed in PV-EC cells are relaxed compared to the application in electrolyzers.
Concerning preparation of the catalysts the targeted area for the application as electrode in our cassette device is 50.3 cm2. Therefore, the synthesis method should allow the preparation on an area beyond typical laboratory scale (e.g. >1 cm2). NiMo and NiFeOX can both be deposited via electrodepostition,19 which is an easily feasible and wide spread method for catalyst fabrication and which allows the deposition on large areas. While so far electrodeposition of these materials had been reported on substrates like transparent conductive oxides (TCO) covered with titanium and gold20 or glassy carbon disks (GC),7,13 we used nickel sheets as substrates to be compatible with our PV-EC cassette design as described in detail elsewhere.5 The nickel sheets should not only serve as substrate but also as a fall back solution if the catalyst layer is detached. In that case the PV-EC device is still able to operate due to the active electrode material, although the performance will decrease.
We report on the development of the NiFeOX and NiMo catalyst coated nickel electrodes of 50.3 cm2 size via electrodeposition, their implementation into the PV-EC device, the long-term stability of the catalyst system and the overall performance of the 64 cm2 area cassette with ηSTH = 5.1% using the developed catalyst materials.
Experimental
Catalyst deposition

Cleaning. 
The nickel sheets (99.2%, supplied by Metall Jobst, Germany), which were used as substrates, were cut into 1.5 × 1.5 cm2 samples for a deposition area of 0.5 cm2 and round samples with a diameter of 8.5 cm for the deposition area of 50.3 cm2. Prior to the catalyst depositions, the samples were cleaned for 30 min of sonication using the following solvents (i) acetone (AnalaR NORMAPUR), followed by rinsing with deionized (DI, Millipore) water and (ii) 3 M HCl solution (mixing HCl (25%, Emsure) and DI water). After the ultra-sonic cleaning, the samples were rinsed with DI water and ethanol (GPR rectapur, 99.5% denaturated with 1% MEK) and dried with compressed air.


Electrodeposition of NiFeOX for OER. 
The deposition electrolyte was a 0.1 M solution consisting of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (98% Alfa Aesar) and FeCl2·4H2O (Emsure) dissolved in DI water. The ratio of Ni to Fe was varied from 100:0 to 60:40 (mol:mol). Nitrogen was sparged into the electrolyte for 20 min prior to the film deposition in order to prevent oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III).20 The electrodeposition was carried out using a Gamry Reference 600 potentiostat in a two-electrode setup. In the case of the small deposition areas (0.5 cm2), a carbon rod was used as counter electrode. For the large deposition areas (50.3 cm2), Ni sheet was employed as counter electrode, respectively. The deposition areas are defined by O-rings with the respective diameters. Schematic deposition setups are shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Electrodeposition setups for the deposition on an area of (a) 0.5 cm2 and (b) 50.3 cm2. The deposition areas are defined by O-rings with the respective diameters. In (a) the cell body is made of Teflon and a carbon rod was used as counter electrode (distance between working electrode and counter electrode: 1.5 cm). For the setup shown in (b) the cell body consisted of polymethylmethacrylat (PMMA) and a nickel sheet of 50.3 cm2 was used as counter electrode (distance between electrodes: 7 mm). 
Besides the varied Ni:Fe ratio, different deposition times between 10 s to 40 s, deposition charge densities (−100 to −400 mC cm−2) as well as deposition methods (continuous vs. pulsed20) were investigated. For the implementation into the modular device, the electrodeposition on the 50.3 cm2 electrodes was carried out using the following deposition parameters: Ni:Fe ratio of 80:20 mol%, Jdep = −10 mA cm−2, tdep = 40 s, pulsed deposition mode (5 s pulse, 10 s stirring), Tdep = room temperature (RT). After deposition, samples were cleaned with DI water to remove possible contaminants.


Electrodeposition of NiMo for HER. 
The electrodeposition of NiMo was performed according to the literature.7,19 The electrolyte solution consists of NiSO4·6H2O (1), Na2MoO4·2H2O (2) and Na3C6H5O7·2H2O (3) (quantities: 3.16 g (1), 1.92 g (2), 3.52 g (3)19) dissolved in NH4OH.7,19 All reagents were in reagent grade. The electrodeposition was performed with a Gamry Reference 600 potentiostat in a two-electrode setup. The same deposition setups and electrode configurations as mentioned above were used (see Fig. 1a and b). Different deposition times at a constant deposition current density of −160 mA cm−2 were investigated on a substrate size of 0.5 cm2. Additionally, the influence of a constant deposition charge density was investigated on the same substrate size of 0.5 cm2 (e.g.: Q = Jt = constant → Jdep1 = −160 mA cm−2 for tdep1 = 1200 s, Qdep1 = −192 C cm−2; and Jdep2 = −1200 mA cm−2 for tdep2 = 160 s, Qdep2 = −192 C cm−2).
For the deposition on the nickel sheets of 50.3 cm2, the following parameters were used: 80 mL of NH4OH, 6.32 g of NiSO4·6H2O, 3.84 g of Na2MoO4·2H2O, 7.04 g of Na3C6H5O7·2H2O, tdep = 19200 s, Jdep = −10 mA cm−2, Qdep = −192 C cm−2, Tdep = room temperature (RT), stirring 800 rpm, continuous mode.

Electrochemical measurements
All electrochemical measurements were performed in 1 M potassium hydroxide solution at room temperature using a Gamry Reference 600 potentiostat. If a three-electrode setup was used, then Ag|AgCl served as reference electrode. The following measurement sequence was performed:
(1) Open circuit potential (OCP) for 600 s.
(2) Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) between 100 kHz and 0.01 Hz.
(3) Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements in a non-faradaic region at different scan rates (5, 25, 75, 125, 175, 200 mV s−1).
(4) Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1.
(5) Chronopotentiometry measurements were applied at (±)10 mA cm−2 for 900 s.
The uncompensated cell resistance, which is determined by means of electrical impedance spectroscopy, was calculated using Gamry Echem Analyst software with the included “CPE with diffusion model” and was used for the iR correction. The performed CV measurements were used to calculate the electrochemically active surface area (ESCA) according to McCrory et al.7 The overpotential was evaluated at a current density where no overlapping reactions occurred. The error bars shown in Fig. 3 and 4 represent the standard deviation evaluated from measurements of several samples deposited with the same deposition conditions.
Scanning electron microscopy
The morphologies of the catalysts' surfaces were investigated prior and after the electrochemical measurements. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of NiFeOX samples were collected using an Oxford instrument X-MaxN 150 mm2 at 20 kV. For NiMo samples, a Zeiss 1550 SEM was used. The obtained images can be found in the ESI (see Fig. S1 and S2†).
Solar cell fabrication
The a-Si:H/a-Si:H/μc-Si:H triple junction cell used in this study was prepared on a 10 × 10 cm2 glass substrate coated with SnO2:F as front contact material. The thin film silicon was deposited via plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. Additional information on the deposition and the patterning procedures can be found elsewhere.4,5 As reflecting back contact, ZnO:Al/Ag was deposited via magnetron sputtering and thermal evaporation on the solar cell back side. The solar cell has an active area of 64 cm2.
Implementation and measurements of the PV-EC device
A schematic of the modular device can be seen in Fig. 2.5 The cell body is made of Polymethylmethacrylat (PMMA). Metal sheets between the back side of the solar cell and the catalyst serve as electrodes as well as protection of the solar cell against the corrosive electrolyte. The electrolyte chambers can be separated by a membrane.

The measurements were carried out in 1 M potassium hydroxide solution (without temperature control) and under AM1.5G illumination (1000 W m−2, class AAA spectrum) supplied by a Wacom sun simulator WXS-140S-Super. The current–voltage (I–V) curves and the chronoamperometric measurements (CA, current over time) were measured with a Keithley SMU. Platinum (Ti substrate, supplied by Metakem) and IrOX (Ti substrate, supplied by Metakem) were used as precious metal reference electrode system. This pair of catalysts represents very active, however less abundant, precious metal catalysts.
The solar-to-hydrogen efficiency ηSTH of the PV-EC device was calculated from the I–V curves under illumination according to the following equation: (1)here, ΔE is the thermodynamic potential (ΔEH2O = 1.23 V), ηF is the faradaic efficiency, which is assumed to be equal to unity for the used modular device.5,7JOP is the current density at the operation point of the device. The total integrated power input density is the incident light intensity (e.g. 1000 W m−2 of the AM1.5G spectrum).
Results and discussion
Deposition parameters for OER and HER side
Deposition parameters, such as the precursor ratio, deposition current density, deposition time and deposition method (pulsed vs. continuous) influence the properties and performance of the catalyst layer regarding the respective gas evolution reaction. Therefore, we investigated a wide range of parameters for the deposition of the materials and evaluated its suitability with respect to OER and HER reactions.

NiFeOX for OER. 

Fig. 3 shows the potential at 20 mA cm−2 and the respective overpotential as a function of iron concentrations. The potential at 20 mA cm−2 was chosen for the comparison because at lower current densities (e.g. at 10 mA cm−2) an overlap between a Ni oxidation peak20 and the oxygen evolution reaction could be observed, hence the reactions could not be clearly separated. Different charge densities (constant deposition current densities Jdep, varying deposition times tdep) and continuous vs. pulsed deposition methods are indicated. The samples were deposited on an area of 0.5 cm2 using the setup shown in Fig. 1a. The electrochemical characterization was carried out in a three-electrode setup using platinum as counter electrode.
 Fig. 3  Electrode potential of NiFeOX catalysts on 0.5 cm2 area measured in three-electrode configuration vs. Ag|AgCl reference and Pt counter electrode as a function of the Fe concentration evaluated at a current density of J = 20 mA cm−2. Pulsed and continuous depositions at different deposition times and charge densities are indicated. Right hand side axis indicates the corresponding overpotential voltages. 
One of the key parameters investigated here is the iron to nickel ratio in the deposition solution. In Fig. 3, one can see that already with 5 mol% Fe the overpotential is reduced by ∼100 mV. This positive effect has been extensively investigated and reported in the literature.13,27–29 Possible reasons for the increase in OER activity are an increase in conductivity as well as changes in the electronic structure and the Ni–O local environment due to the iron incorporation. The role of Fe induced partial-charge-transfer mechanism is also discussed.13,23,29 In our study the best performance of the NiFeOX catalyst, i.e. the lowest overpotentials, are generally found in the range from 15–25 mol%. Increasing the deposition charge density in the continuous deposition mode via an increase in deposition time (compare the black and green curves) leads to a lower overpotential for all Fe concentrations investigated. This effect is probably due to a higher active surface area deposited during the higher deposition time (10 s vs. 40 s). Concerning the deposition mode for a given deposition charge density/time, we would expect lower overpotentials for the samples deposited in the pulsed deposition mode. The benefits of the pulsed mode over the continuous mode are well investigated and have been discussed in literature.20,30 The disadvantage of the continuous mode is related to the lower catalyst packing density due to the deposition mechanism. During the continuous deposition, the nitrate reduction at the surface leads to a local pH gradient and therefore to precipitation of metal hydroxides on the electrode surface and on the outer surface layers.20 For a deposition charge density of −100 mC cm−2 (compare the black and blue curves in Fig. 3), the pulsed deposited samples indeed show lower overpotentials. However, for higher charge densities (−400 mC cm−2) (green and red curves) no difference between the deposition modes can be seen. SEM images prior and after the electrochemical measurements of NiFeOX containing 20 mol% Fe, deposited for 40 s in the pulsed deposition mode can be found in the ESI (Fig. S1†).
In summary, NiFeOX compounds were prepared by electrodeposition to be used as catalysts for the OER in a water splitting device. Materials with a range of 5–40 mol% Fe in the process solution yielded considerable reduction of the electrode overpotential as compared with pure Ni substrates. Best performance was obtained for 15–25 mol% Fe for various deposition conditions (η in the range of 0.28–0.30 V). For comparison the reported overpotentials for nickel iron oxides are in the range of 0.34–0.38 V measured for samples of 0.2 cm2 substrate size in 1 M sodium hydroxide solution.7 Based on these results on 0.5 cm2 electrodes, we chose for the deposition on larger size electrodes of 50.3 cm2 in our PV-EC cassette system, the parameters of 20 mol% Fe, 40 s, −400 mC cm−2 and pulsed deposition mode.


NiMo for HER. 
The same deposition setup as shown in Fig. 1a was used for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst NiMo. The geometrical area of the deposited films was 0.5 cm2. All depositions were performed in the continuous deposition mode. The parameters investigated were the deposition time at a constant deposition current as well as the effects of a constant deposition charge density of 192 C cm−2.19 The effects of the constant deposition charge density are of interest for the deposition on an electrode area of 50.3 cm2 using Gamry Reference 600 potentiostat (current limit: 600 mA). Since with this power supply the current – and therefore the current density – is limited, the charge density could possibly be kept constant by increasing the deposition time at a lower deposition current density (Q = Jt). In Fig. 4 the overpotentials of the different samples prepared with different conditions, which are listed in Table 1, are shown. The overpotentials of the different samples were evaluated at −10 mA cm−2, since no overlapping reaction was observed. The electrochemical characterization was carried out in a three-electrode setup using iridium oxide as counter electrode. The measured overpotentials of platinum and nickel are shown for comparison.

The samples A–D were deposited with the same deposition charge density of −192 C cm−2. Therefore, the deposition time as well as the deposition current density was varied. All samples show a similar HER overpotential in the range of −71 to −84 mV, which is less than half of the overpotential measured for nickel. Hence, the variation in current density is compensated by the variation in deposition time. SEM images prior and after the electrochemical measurements of the NiMo samples B and D can be found in the ESI (see Fig. S2†).
For the samples E–I the deposition current density was kept constant at −160 mA cm−2 and the deposition time was varied from 600–1800 s. Therefore, the deposition charge density varies from −96 to −288 C cm−2. The samples F–H show similar overpotentials to the samples A–D (−60 to −82 mV). For the samples E and I (600 s and 1800 s) the overpotentials account for −193 mV and −208 mV, respectively. In the case of sample E (600 s), one possible reason for the high overpotential could be due to the short deposition time resulting in a too thin film on the nickel substrate and therefore less catalytic active sites. The high overpotential of sample I could possibly be due a detachment of the catalyst due to low mechanical stability of thicker layers deposited.
Overall, electrically deposited NiMo alloys allow a wide range of deposition conditions, since the effects of a varied deposition time at a constant deposition current density or the constant charge density are not significant. The overpotential towards the HER reaction is significantly reduced compared with pure nickel substrates. The lowest overpotentials in the range of −60 mV to −84 mV were found, for a constant deposition charge density (−192 C cm−2) and for deposition times from 900–1500 s at −160 mA cm−2 (deposition charge density −144 to −240 C cm−2). For comparison the reported overpotentials of NiMo deposited on 0.2 cm2 substrates and measured in 1 M sodium hydroxide are in the range of −0.04 V to −0.07 V.7 Based on these results obtained for 0.5 cm2 electrodes, we performed the deposition on large sized electrodes (50.3 cm2) under constant charge density conditions. The parameters used for the deposition were tdep = 19200 s, Jdep = −10 mA cm−2, Qdep = −192 C cm−2 and continuous deposition mode.

HER and OER catalysts on electrodes of 50.3 cm2 and their implementation in the PV-EC device
Next, we investigated the performance of the NiMo (HER) and the NiFeOX (OER) catalysts in combination on both electrodes. The catalyst layers were deposited on an increased area of 50.3 cm2 to implement them in the large scale modular device.5 The depositions were carried out with the parameters described in the Experimental section. Prior to the implementation in the device, different catalyst systems were electrochemically characterized according to point 4 and 5 of the measurement sequence described in the Experimental section (LSV and CP measurement). Fig. 5 shows the LSV curves of the main systems investigated on electrode areas of 50.3 cm2 (Pt/IrOX, NiMo/NiFeOX and Ni/Ni), while the additional results on various catalyst systems (LSV and CP) can be found in the ESI (Fig. S3 and S4†).
 Fig. 5  
J–V curves of the NiFeOX/NiMo catalyst pair deposited each on 50.3 cm2 nickel sheets, compared with precious metal based IrOX/Pt catalysts and pure Ni/Ni sheets. The measurements were performed in two-electrode configuration in 1 M KOH. 
The system consisting of nickel sheets for both electrodes is showing the highest overpotential of ∼690 mV (vs. 1.23 V) at 10 mA cm−2 (horizontal guideline). With the NiMo and NiFeOX catalysts deposited both on Ni sheets, the overpotential can be substantially reduced down to ∼455 mV at 10 mA cm−2 on 50.3 cm2 geometrical area. This is very close to the Pt/IrOX reference system based on precious metals, which shows an overpotential of ∼450 mV at 10 mA cm−2. Hence, the improved earth abundant system of NiMo/NiFeOX on 50.3 cm2 nickel sheets is a very good alternative to precious metal systems in alkaline media, since the system fulfills the requirement for a 10% efficient integrated water splitting device, where the combined overpotentials should not exceed 0.45 V.7,31–33 Further improvements to reduce the overpotential can be made regarding the substrate and its structure. As an example for the use of three-dimensional substrates, Fang et al. reported an overpotential of ∼300 mV for NiMo/NiFeOX prepared on nickel foam of 3 cm2 geometrical size in alkaline media.14 This shows that lower overpotentials can be achieved by replacing the two-dimensional with a three-dimensional substrate creating a higher surface area.
In the following the performance of the entire PV-EC device will be discussed. Therefore, we combine the I–V curves of the solar cell (active area APV = 64 cm2) and the NiMo/NiFeOX catalyst system (electrode area of 50.3 cm2), both individually measured. Again the Pt/IrOX reference system was measured for comparison.

Fig. 6 shows the corresponding I–V-curves. The PV parameters of the solar cell are listed in Table 2. The intersection of the I–V curves shows the expected operation point of the PV-EC device. As could be already expected from the results shown in Fig. 5, for both catalyst systems the same operation current Iop,PV-EC = 265 mA was found. According to eqn (1), the solar-to-hydrogen efficiency for both systems account for 5.1%.

The intersection point delivers the current (265 mA) and voltage (1.7 V) at the theoretical operation point of the PV-EC device. Using eqn (1) the theoretically expected solar-to-hydrogen efficiencies can be calculated for both systems (ηSTH = 5.1%).

Finally, we integrated the catalyst systems together with the triple junction solar cell into our cassette device to investigate the performance of this compact PV-EC device under AM1.5G simulated solar illumination. Fig. 7 shows the I–V curves for the integrated PV-EC device consisting of the 64 cm2 a-Si:H/a-Si:H/μc-Si:H triple junction solar cell combined with the two catalyst systems of Pt/IrOX (black curve) and NiMo/NiFeOX (red curve) discussed above. The currents measured at 0 V, are the operation currents for unbiased water splitting employing the different catalyst systems. The solar-to-hydrogen efficiencies calculated according to eqn (1) result in ηSTH(NiMo/NiFeOX) = 5.1 (±0.1)% and ηSTH(Pt/IrOX) = 4.8 (±0.1)%, respectively, very similar to the predictions made from the results presented above (Fig. 6).

The current at V = 0 V (grey vertical line) is the operation point for unbiased water splitting. The different operation currents for both catalyst systems are indicated and the resulting solar-to-hydrogen efficiencies are calculated to be ηSTH(NiMo/NiFeOX) = (5.1 ± 0.1)% and ηSTH(Pt/IrOX) = (4.8 ± 0.1)%. 
One possibility to further increase the PV-EC device performance is to reduce the occurring series resistance losses. Therefore, the distance between the electrodes, which was in this case 11 mm, can be decreased towards a zero gap configuration. In that case, the catalysts would have to be deposited on a porous substrate of a geometrical area of 50.3 cm2 and be implemented in the device. Such an approach has been reported by Fang et al. who synthesized NiMo and NiFeOX on nickel foam, however only on 3 cm2 size.14
As concerns the fill factor of the solar cell in the PV-EC cassette system (in the present study 52.5%), it is so far mainly determined by the contact between the ZnO:Al/Ag back contact and the electric parallel connection of the 64 individual solar cells employed by using conductive metal tape (3M) as well as the front contact grid.5 A better contact arrangement to reduce the internal series resistances should be possible which would improve the performance of the combined system further.5
In summary, we have successfully upscaled a catalyst system pair based on non-precious metals from 0.5 cm2 to 50.3 cm2 (factor 100) to be used in an integrated PV-EC cassette device. The NiMo/NiFeOX catalyst pair shows overpotentials as low as 455 mV at 10 mA cm−2. In combination with a triple junction solar cell of 64 cm2 area it even slightly outperforms a corresponding device with noble metal based Pt/IrOX catalysts to yield a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of ηSTH = 5.1 (±0.1)%.
Performance stability of the PV-EC cassette system
A crucial issue for the operation of integrated PV-EC systems is their stability against chemical corrosion and, related to that, mechanical stability of the layer stacks under oscillating temperature and illumination conditions. In order to investigate the stability over time, the cassette device using the same 64 cm2 solar cell and employing the different catalyst systems were tested for 600 s each under illumination, while the current was monitored (Fig. 8). In agreement with Fig. 7, the PV-EC device employing the NiMo/NiFeOX catalyst system shows a slightly higher current throughout the measurement as compared with the Pt/IrOX catalysts. After an initial rapid decay of the current of about 10% of its initial value, the currents remain stable with some noise as a function of time which can be for example due to formation and detachment of gas bubbles on the electrodes surfaces. The earth abundant system delivers an average current of IOP(NiMo/NiFeOX) = 214 ± 9 mA and the precious metal system yields IOP(Pt/IrOX) = 197 ± 38 mA. The average current reported earlier5 for the earth abundant system Ni/Ni employed in the PV-EC device with the same 64 cm2 solar cell is shown for comparison (IOP(Ni/Ni) = 110 mA). Therefore, the improved NiMo/NiFeOX system remains stable within 10 min and yields almost twice as much current at the operation point than the previously used earth abundant system.5
 Fig. 8  Chronoamperometric measurements of the fully integrated PV-EC device under bias-free conditions featuring different catalyst systems in 1 M KOH and under 1000 W m−2 illumination. The previously reported current over time of the earth abundant Ni/Ni system is shown for comparison (blue dashed line).5 
In addition, we performed long-term stability measurements of the catalyst systems with simulated day-night cycles. We consider that under such conditions additional effects could occur like the oscillating illumination and related temperature exposure, which could add to instability, but also possible curing and re-formation of the catalyst electrodes during the dark cycle, which could be beneficial. As an example, during illumination and operating electrolysis the catalyst performance could be decreased due to detachment or dissolution of the catalyst layers. The effect of a decreased catalyst performance then could be inverted during the recovery time, due to precipitation on the electrode surfaces, and the catalyst potentials could be restored after the recovery time.34
We investigated two different catalyst systems under these conditions, Ni/Ni and NiMo/NiFeOX. We performed the experiment similar to a day and night cycle, with 6 h of operation under −10 mA cm−2 provided by the potentiostat (simulating illumination) and keeping the system without bias overnight (open circuit conditions, simulating no illumination, no electrolysis). The temperature was not varied during the measurements, although it was shown that additional heating caused by the illumination is beneficial for the device performance.35,36

Fig. 9a shows the potential over time at −10 mA cm−2 for the Ni/Ni system for four days. One can see that the potential generally decreases during the time of operation for each day. This is probably due to partly dissolution of the electrode surface in the alkaline media or coverage with a less active material.37 However, this process is more than reversed during the recovery time from day to day to yield a decrease of the potential of about 300 mV after 4 days of operation and resting (compare potential at day 1 (black curve) and potential at day 4 (magenta curve) in Fig. 9a). One possible explanation is that during the recovery time, a more active species precipitates on the electrode surface (e.g. NiOX). Another explanation is that the electrode's surface area is increased due to precipitation forming a higher electrochemically active surface area compared to the initial electrode area.34 An increase in electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was shown by means of cyclic voltammetry measurements with different scan speeds (see ESI, Fig. S5†).
 Fig. 9  The electrode potential to maintain a current density of −10 mA cm−2 over time of the catalyst system consisting of (a) Ni/Ni and (b) NiMo/NiFeOX. The systems were operated for 6 h per day, 4 days in a row, intercepted by about 18 h resting time. The magenta curve “Ni/Ni day 4” (in (b)) is shown for comparison of the systems. 
In Fig. 9b, the potential over time at −10 mA cm−2 is shown for the NiMo/NiFeOX catalyst system. Additionally, the potential over time for the Ni/Ni system on day 4 (taken from Fig. 9a) is shown for comparison. In accordance with the above presented data, the electrode potential to drive the electrolysis at −10 mA cm−2 is considerably lower for the NiMo/NiFeOX system as compared with the Ni/Ni electrodes. Different from the observation for the Ni/Ni system, the potential measured for the NiMo/NiFeOX system during the operation time remains constant and does not show any significant changes during the dark/resting period from day to day. Confirming the observation, SEM images (see Fig. S6†) show in both cases surface morphologies similar to the initial states (see Fig. S1 and S2†) before the stability test.
We conclude that the earth abundant material based NiMo/NiFeOX catalyst system for water splitting shows very good stability during a simulated day-night cycle measurement and outperforms the earlier reported system with Ni/Ni catalysts considerably while it shows even slightly better performance than a system with Pt/IrOX catalysts.
Conclusions
NiMo (for the hydrogen evolution reaction) and NiFeOX (for the oxygen evolution reaction) catalysts were successfully prepared via electrodeposition on geometrical areas of up to 50.3 cm2 to be used in an integrated PV-EC cassette system with a triple junction a-Si:H/a-Si:H/μc-Si:H solar cell for solar water splitting. With the NiMo/NiFeOX catalyst system a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of ηSTH = (5.1 ± 0.1)% was achieved, slightly higher than with the precious metal catalysts Pt/IrOX which showed an efficiency of ηSTH = (4.8 ± 0.1)% and about twice as high as for the previously used earth abundant system (Ni/Ni).5 The system with NiMo/NiFeOX catalysts showed excellent stability over 4 days simulated day-night cycles with a potential as low as 1.75 V to drive a constant −10 mA cm−2 current density. Overall, the earth abundant materials based NiMo/NiFeOX catalyst system developed here is suitable for the application in PV-EC devices for solar water splitting with areas ≫1 cm2 and it shows a performance close to or even better than systems based on precious metal catalysts.
