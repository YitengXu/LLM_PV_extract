    , Accepted 18th October 2011First published on 17th November 2011AbstractThe ordered-bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaic device comprising a semiconducting donor polymer incorporated into pristine/unmodified vertically aligned arrays of metal oxide acceptor nanotubes/nanorods is widely perceived as being structurally ideal for energy conversion but the power conversion efficiencies of such devices remain relatively low (in the order of η = 0.6%) when compared with bilayer or non-ordered bulk heterojunction systems. We explain the incongruity by investigating the morphology and microstructure of regio-regular poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT) infiltrated and confined within the cavities of TiO2 nanotube arrays. A series of TiO2 nanotube arrays with different nanotube diameters and inter-nanotube spacings are fabricated by the liquid-phase atomic layer deposition (LALD) technique, and P3HT is infiltrated into the array cavities via a vacuum-annealing technique. X-Ray diffraction studies reveal that the P3HT chains in both nano-confined and non-confined (i.e. planar film) environments are well-aligned and oriented edge-on with respect to the underlying substrate. Up to 2.5-fold improvement in the incident-photon-to-converted-electron efficiency (IPCE) is observed in ordered-BHJ structures over benchmark planar devices which we attribute to the increase in interfacial area resulting from the use of the nanostructures. However, the large effective surface area conferred by the nano-arrays (up to 9.5 times that of the planar system) suggests that much higher efficiencies could be harnessed. Our study shows that the morphology and orientation of the infiltrated polymer play a critical role in the charge transport of the device, and suggests that better understanding and control of polymer morphology under nano-confinement in the nano-array will be the key to fully reaping the promised benefit of ordered-BHJ devices.
1. Introduction
The intense interest in the field of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) is driven by the vision that OPVs may one day rival silicon technology in terms of material and production cost, and emerge as the next generation of renewable energy. A variety of OPV device architectures have been investigated to date, and they can be broadly categorized into dye sensitized solar cells, all-organic solid state solar cells and organic–inorganic hybrid donor–acceptor based heterojunction solar cells. Of these, hybrid ordered bulk-heterojunction (BHJ)1–4 with inter-digitated donor–acceptor (D–A) domains (Fig. 1a) has fascinated the research community due to its potential in addressing several critical issues related to OPV device performance. An inter-digitated architecture consisting of fingers around 10–20 nm in diameter is expected to (i) provide D–A interfaces that are within the exciton diffusion length-scale (3 to 20 nm) for dissociation of the majority of excitons;5 (ii) maximize D–A interfacial area for exciton dissociation and charge carrier generation, and (iii) create direct percolation pathways for charges to reach the respective electrodes and minimize charge recombination.

An interesting development in inter-digitated BHJ systems is the use of ordered arrays of n-type metal oxide semiconductor nanotube/nanowire as the acceptor material in the system. The ordered arrays function as mechanically robust scaffolds over which p-type donor materials are deposited and infiltrated to form well-defined inter-digitated D–A structures. The surfaces of these arrays are often highly reactive and can be functionalized to enhance exciton dissociation and prevent charge recombination at the D–A interface.6 Furthermore, the energy levels of the semiconductors can be tuned by doping the semiconductor to enhance open-circuit voltage (Voc)7 or the absorption of light.8 Semiconductor arrays comprising TiO2 and ZnO nanotubes/wires have been widely employed9–16 as they are optically transparent, possess high electron mobilities and are environmentally benign. Photovoltaic cells consisting of TiO2 or ZnO nanowire arrays (with pristine/non-chemically modified surfaces) embedded in regio-regular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) or poly(2-methoxy-5-(2′-ethylhexyl-oxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene) (MEH-PPV) have shown power conversion efficiencies between 0.4 and 0.6%.9,11–13,17 They represent a 3 to 4-fold efficiency improvement over bilayer devices comprising the same metal oxide and polymers.9,12,16 The efficiencies of array-based BHJ systems can be further enhanced through the modification of nanowire surface to encourage better charge separation at the active interface,18–21 and the re-engineering of nano-array dimensions to better match exciton diffusion length-scales.22,23
Another critical factor that determines the efficiency of array-based organic–inorganic BHJ is the morphology and orientation of the organic component, especially with respect to its confinement in nanostructures. For example, the direction of π–π stacking in P3HT is known to influence charge transport in a device24–29 and it has been demonstrated that charge mobility could be increased by a factor of 100 when P3HT chains were π-stacked in the direction of charge transport.30 Recent studies on P3HT/ZnO nanowire devices show that sparsely spaced ZnO nanowire arrays provided better-performing devices than dense arrays although the latter offered larger interface for exciton dissociation.22,23 The large nanowire spacings presumably allowed for better P3HT orientation in the direction favorable to charge transport. Therefore, in addition to interfacial area optimization, a deeper understanding of the interplay between nano-array morphology and polymer chain orientation and packing within the nano-arrays is also essential for improving the performance of such a system.
In this study, the physical properties of the regio-regular P3HT polymer was investigated for the first time in relation to its confinement in the metal oxide nanotube. TiO2 nanotube arrays of different nanotube dimensions, inter-nanotube spacings and array densities were fabricated by liquid-phase atomic layer deposition (LALD) over anodic alumina templates (AAO).9 The chain orientation of P3HT under various degrees of nano-confinement in the nano-arrays was elucidated by optical and X-ray diffraction studies. These physical observations were then compared with corresponding OPV device performances. We found that in addition to the interfacial area, the orientation of P3HT polymer chains was also a critical factor in governing device performance. The P3HT chains in our system were found to orientate edge-on with respect to the underlying substrate regardless of the degree of nano-confinement. A vertical or face-on alignment31,32 is however expected to provide better pathways for charge transport in an interdigitated ordered BHJ system. This observation could explain the widely reported low conversion efficiencies in hybrid BHJ systems. Our findings have important implications in the design of nanotube arrays and the choice of complementary donor materials for device optimization.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Preparation of AAO templates for nano-array deposition
ITO-coated glass substrates (sheet resistance of 10 Ω sq−1, Merck Display Technologies) were cleaned by successive ultrasonication in detergent, acetone and isopropanol. After drying in a stream of pressurized N2, the substrates underwent 10 min of UV-ozone cleaning at 100 °C. Next, 40 nm TiO2 hole-blocking layers (Fig. 2a) were spin coated on the substrates from a sol solution prepared by room temperature acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TIP) in ethanol with a reaction molar ratio TIP:H2O:ethanol:HNO3 of 1:1:50:0.2.9 The TiO2 films were dried at 120 °C and converted to the anatase crystal phase by annealing at 500 °C for 2 hours in air. Al films (∼150 nm) from which AAO templates were fabricated were deposited on the TiO2-coated ITO–glass substrates by electron-beam evaporation of Al (99.9999%, Super Conductor Materials) at a rate of 5 nm s−1 (Edwards FL400). AAO templates were produced by anodizing the Al-coated substrates opposite a Pt mesh counter electrode in 0.2 M sulfuric acid, 0.3 M oxalic acid, or 0.3 M phosphoric acid with a constant applied voltage of 25 V, 60 V and 120 V to produce templates of 3 different pore diameters and spacings. All solutions were maintained at 2 °C. The templates were then immersed in 5 wt% H3PO4 for various durations (Table 1) to allow through connectivity to the substrate and simultaneously adjust the pore diameter.9,33

When treated under atmospheric pressure, voids can be seen in the nano-arrays and the P3HT overlayer remained smooth. In contrast, voids are absent when the system was treated under vacuum, and there was complete intercalation of P3HT with the nano-arrays, with the tips of the nanotubes clearly visible. All scale bars represent 150 nm. 
2.2 Preparation of TiO2 nanotube arrays
The TiO2 nanotube arrays on TiO2-coated ITO–glass substrates were fabricated by LALD9 of TiO2 in the above described AAO templates. A typical deposition cycle involved sequential chemisorption and hydrolysis reactions by successively immersing the AAO templates in (1) TIP/toluene solution and (2) ethanol hydrated with 10 vol% DI water respectively. Procedures 1 and 2 were repeated until the desired nanotube wall thickness was achieved. The AAO templates were removed by immersing the substrate in 0.01 M KOH for 1 hour. Detailed procedures for LALD and nano-array fabrication are provided elsewhere.9 The resulting arrays were converted to the anatase crystal structure by sintering at 500 °C for 2 hours in air.
2.3 
          P3HT deposition, infiltration and characterization
All spin coating, device fabrication and characterization procedures were conducted in a N2 filled glove box (MBraun). The main P3HT employed for our studies (BASF P200 Sepiolid) had a Mw of 21.3k and a regio-regularity of 98%. Its higher molecular weight counterpart (ESI†) had a Mw of 55–60k and a regio-regularity of 90–93%. P3HT was spin coated on the TiO2 nanotube arrays from chlorobenzene solutions with concentrations and spin speeds adjusted to achieve the desired film thickness. To enhance P3HT infiltration, the substrates were heated to and maintained at 250 °C in a vacuum oven evacuated to 20 mTorr for 1 hour. The substrates were allowed to cool naturally to room temperature under vacuum. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of the films and nanostructures were captured on the JEOL 6700F system at an acceleration voltage of 5 kV. UV-vis and PL spectra were measured on Perkin-Elmer LS60B and Shimadzu 2501-PC spectrophotometers respectively. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) was performed on the Bruker General Area Detector Diffraction System (GADDs). The GADDs employs a Cu Kα target and has a 2D detector that allows for simultaneous data collection of the user-defined 2θ range without sample or detector movement. Parameters employed for the scans were a voltage of 40 kV, a current of 40 mA, a 2θ angle range of 17° and a scanning duration of 15–60 min. Device fabrication involved spin coating a layer of P3HT in 20 mg ml−1 concentration at 1000 rpm for 1 min followed by vacuum-annealing and evaporating a layer of Ag (80 nm) to complete the device. Both ITO and Ag electrodes were patterned to yield device pixel areas of ca. 0.09 cm2. For incident-photon-converted-to-electron efficiency (IPCE) measurements, white light from a Newport-Oriel 150 W Xenon lamp was focused into a Cornerstone 130 1/8 m monochromator and the monochromatic light channeled into the glove box and onto the device through an optic fibre. A mechanical chopper wheel was placed between the Xe lamp and monchromator to modulate the light in square pulses at 237 Hz and a Stanford Research 830 lock-in amplifier programmed to lock on to that frequency and measure the voltage signal due only to the monochromatic light.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Nano-arrays of different dimensions and densities
Nanoporous anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) templates are arguably the most ubiquitous templates employed for nano-array fabrication. An AAO template can readily be prepared by anodizing aluminium in dilute acids33–35 to give a high density of parallel pore channels where materials can be deposited.36,37 The pore diameters and densities can be controlled by varying the applied voltage and acid electrolyte during anodization.38 In this work, three sets of AAO templates with different pore dimensions (Fig. 1b–d) were fabricated on ITO–glass substrates using voltages and acids shown in Table 1. We employed a sol–gel-derived TiO2 adhesion layer and elevated anodization voltages to overcome the common problem of ITO corrosion and template delamination associated with anodization on ITO–glass.39 Arrays of TiO2 nanotubes were subsequently formed by conformal coating of the AAO pore channels with TiO2via liquid-phase atomic layer deposition (LALD)9 followed by AAO dissolution, and are shown in Fig. 1e–g. The physical dimensions of the resulting TiO2 nanotube arrays (nano-arrays A–C) are summarized in Table 1. It was observed that the larger the anodization voltage applied, the larger the AAO pore diameter and inter-pore spacings. Correspondingly, the nanotube diameter and inter-nanotube spacings were also larger but the density of nanotubes and effective surface area were reduced substantially.
3.2 Filling P3HT into the array cavities
It is essential that the polymer fills the cavities of the nanotubes completely in order to maximize the interfacial contact between the donor and acceptor materials for exciton dissociation. Studies have shown that the degree of polymer infiltration in nanotube arrays has direct correlation with device efficiency.22 In our earlier study, we found that it was challenging to completely infiltrate the nano-arrays with spin-deposited P3HT. Annealing the P3HT at 200 °C after polymer deposition9,40 and modifying the surface of TiO2 to improve wettability between hydrophobic P3HT and hydrophilic TiO29 failed to achieve complete polymer infiltration. Annealing the polymer at higher temperatures of 250 °C improved the degree of infiltration, but voids in the nanostructure were still evident from cross-section FESEM images (Fig. 2b). Clearly, gravity and capillary forces are not by themselves sufficient to drive P3HT completely into the arrays.
Recently, Baek et al. fabricated arrays of P3HT nanorods by forcing molten P3HT into AAO pore channels (1 μm in length, 55–80 nm in diameter) using vacuum.41 Their approach involved placing AAO on top of a P3HT-coated substrate and heating the assembly to 250 °C inside a vacuum oven (0.855 Torr) to achieve complete polymer infiltration. In a modification of Baek's technique, we spin-coated a layer of P3HT directly onto our TiO2 nano-arrays and attempted to realize complete polymer infiltration by annealing the system in an oven at 250 °C and under a vacuum of 20 mTorr (Fig. 2a). The cross-section FESEM image of P3HT in nano-array A (nano-array of the smallest dimensions, Fig. 2d) shows that the array is completely void-free and that complete infiltration of polymer has been achieved. The plane-view image (Fig. 2e) shows intercalation of P3HT and the nanotubes, with the tips of the nanotubes remaining visible and unobstructed (Fig. 2e). This compares with poorly infiltrated P3HT (as with pristine spin-coated P3HT) where a featureless plane was observed (Fig. 2c).
3.3 Microstructure of nano-confined P3HT
We examined the microstructure (crystallinity and chain orientation) of P3HT confined in TiO2 nanotube arrays as well as non-confined P3HT using UV-vis spectroscopy and XRD. For these measurements, samples of P3HT confined in the nano-arrays were prepared by carefully optimizing the thicknesses of P3HT that were deposited such that all P3HT would infiltrate into the arrays after vacuum-melt infiltration and that little to no over-layer would remain on top of the nano-arrays. This ensures that measurements for nano-confined P3HT will have minimal contribution from the non-confined P3HT over-layer. An OPV device fabricated from such a sample instantly short-circuited upon operation, demonstrating that there was indeed little or no residual P3HT residing above the TiO2 nanotube arrays. Non-confined P3HT samples were prepared by spin coating a layer of the polymer over a glass substrate or a plane layer of TiO2. All P3HT samples were subjected to the same vacuum-annealing treatment to ensure consistent thermal histories.
The absorption spectra of all non-confined and nano-confined P3HT samples (Fig. 3) showed well-defined vibronic peaks at 525, 550 and 600 nm, characteristic of pure P3HT polymer in solid state. There was no significant spectral shift across all samples, indicating that the crystallinity found in pristine non-confined P3HT was preserved in nano-confined P3HT. The size and density of the nanotubes did not significantly influence the crystallinity of nano-confined P3HT (Fig. 3), presumably due to the small radius of gyration of P3HT (<6 nm)42 relative to the size of the nano-array cavity (ca. 30–165 nm for nano-arrays A–C). The polymer chains were thus able to order themselves reasonably well even when confined. Only a slight decrease in peak definition at 550 and 600 nm was observed in P3HT infiltrated into nano-array A (the smallest dimension), probably due to the small loss in polymer ordering as the polymer was subjected to a higher degree of confinement. Intuitively, such observation is not surprising because the higher the degree of confinement, the higher the likelihood of the loss in polymer ordering.42
 Fig. 3  Normalized absorption spectra of non-confined and nano-confined P3HT. All films were vacuum-annealed at 250 °C and 20 mTorr for 1 hour. 
We examined the ordering direction of P3HT chains by conducting out-of-plane (α = 0.18°) grazing angle XRD. The XRD peak positions for all samples were observed to be very similar (Fig. 4b). All spectra showed a peak at 2θ = 5.4° (and higher order peaks, Fig. 4d) that corresponds to the lamellar layer structure of P3HT with (100) reflections normal to the substrate (i.e. edge-on orientation, Fig. 4f). Furthermore, a characteristic peak at 2θ = 23.6° that would have corresponded to (010) reflections due to π–π inter-chain stacking of P3HT43 (i.e. face-on orientation) was visibly absent in all samples (Fig. 4e). Taken together, these observations imply that the P3HT chains in all samples—both nano-confined and non-confined—are uniformly well aligned and oriented edge-on with respect to the underlying substrate, with the P3HT hexyl chains directed perpendicular to the substrate. The same edge-on orientation was observed by Kim et al. in P3HT deposited on the PEDOT:PSS-coated ITO substrate, and it was surmised that an edge-on configuration was energetically favorable because the area of contact between the hydrophobic alkyl side-chains of P3HT and the hydrophilic substrate would be minimized.43 Although the XRD spectra of all samples are similar, obvious differences in the intensities of the peaks at 2θ = 5.4° can be observed; the intensity of the peaks of non-confined P3HT (on both ITO–glass and planar TiO2) is about twice that of nano-confined P3HT (Fig. 4c). This indicates a higher degree of crystallinity in non-confined P3HT, and the presence of smaller or scattered domains in nano-confined P3HT in which the polymer orientation is random or disordered.

(f) Schematic representation of the three preferred configurations that P3HT chains can adopt when deposited on a surface. 
While an edge-on orientation has been widely observed for regio-regular P3HT deposited on a hydrophilic planar surface, and in our case similarly observed for P3HT confined in TiO2 nanotube arrays, we note that a partial face-on alignment was observed by Kim et al. for P3HT confined within vertical pore channels of the pristine AAO template.43 The authors attributed the preferential alignment to the complex interactions between the hydrophobic P3HT hexyl side chains and the hydrophilic AAO pore walls which run perpendicular to the substrate. In the same vein, Sirringhaus et al. suggested that P3HT regio-regularity may have a significant effect on the self-organization and orientation of the polymer, with low-regio-regularity P3HT having a greater preference for face-on alignment than high-regio-regularity P3HT.30 We repeated our experiments using P3HT polymers of a lower regio-regularity (90–93%), but the observation was invariably that of the edge-on alignment for nano-confined P3HT as with the high-regio-regularity samples (see ESI†). The reason for the differences in the polymer orientation in the various systems is not entirely clear. However, we note that the P3HT polymers prepared by Kim et al. were entirely confined within vertical AAO pore channels whereas the P3HT in our system could either be confined within nanotubes or be found within the network of inter-connected inter-nanotube spaces. Processing conditions such as the level of vacuum applied and the rate of heating and cooling and their influence on polymer flow behavior may also play a part in determining the stacking direction of P3HT, though more studies will be needed to verify these postulations.
3.4 Effects of P3HT orientation on charge separation and transport
To study the effect of nanotube dimensions and P3HT microstructure on the charge separation and transport properties in a device, hybrid ordered-BHJ devices were fabricated with nano-arrays A–C using the vacuum-melt infiltration conditions described earlier. The amount of P3HT deposited on the nanotube arrays was increased so that a thin over-layer of P3HT remained above the arrays after the vacuum-melt infiltration process to prevent short circuit. Fig. 5a shows the IPCE of a series of ordered-BHJ and bilayer devices. The IPCEs of nano-array-based devices were 2 to 2.5 times higher than that of the benchmark bilayer device. The improvement in conversion efficiency arises from the multifold increase in the donor–acceptor interfacial area available for exciton splitting in the inter-digitated BHJ architectures. However a closer study of the interfacial area ratios between the interdigitated and planar system (Table 1) reveals a very weak correlation between the interfacial area and conversion efficiency. For example nano-array A has a surface area about 9.5 times that of a plane layer, yet the increase in conversion efficiency for the corresponding device is only twofold. This discrepancy has been widely reported in the literature9,11–13,17,22,23 and the reason remains unclear, though factors such as the degree of polymer infiltration and wettability have been suggested. In our system, the vacuum-melt infiltration technique has provided a high degree of P3HT infiltration into nano-arrays with no visible voids, so the donor–acceptor interface has already been maximized.
 Fig. 5  (a) Incident-photon-to-converted-electron efficiency (IPCE) and (b) photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the P3HT/TiO2 samples. 
Instead, we suggest that the morphology and microstructure of the polymer play determining roles in the charge generation and charge transport processes in the photovoltaic cell. When P3HT is deposited on a planar surface, it typically crystallizes in sheet-like structures in one of three possible configurations—edge-on, face-on or vertical (Fig. 4f). In a classical OPV sandwich architecture with P3HT as an active component, the holes generated within the OPV will then be transported to the anode by hopping either across the polymer alkyl side chains (edge-on), through interchain contacts in the π–π stacking direction (face-on) or along the conjugated backbone (vertical).31,32,45 Charge transport in P3HT is anisotropic, and the rate of transport has been found to be in the order vertical > face-on > edge-on. Therefore in an OPV device, one would prefer that P3HT is oriented face-on or vertical relative to the substrate so that hole collection can be optimized to improve device performance. In our XRD studies, we observed that the P3HT in all our confined systems is edge-on with respect to the underlying substrate. This is the least-preferred of the three orientations for achieving good charge transport. Given that in an ordered BHJ the direction of charge transport is bounded by the finger-like structures running perpendicular to the substrate, the orientation of P3HT will be even more critical in determining the hole mobility of the system. This provides a reason for the relatively low conversion efficiencies conferred by our devices. In addition, P3HT has been documented to take on an edge-on orientation in other BHJ systems43 which probably explains the generally low efficiencies reported in other hybrid ordered BHJs.
We performed a series of photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiments on the three devices to investigate exciton dissociation at the P3HT–TiO2 interface. P3HT was deposited and annealed under the exact same conditions. The PL spectra are carefully normalized to correct for differences in P3HT thicknesses across the samples measured, and are shown in Fig. 5b. Surprisingly, there were no appreciable PL quenching observed in the three devices despite them being working photovoltaic devices. Instead, the PL intensities recorded in all samples were comparable, if not higher, than that of pristine P3HT. This intuitively puzzling phenomenon was previously reported and attributed to the interaction between polarons and excitons at the P3HT–TiO2 interface causing some non-emissive triplet excitons to be converted to emissive singlet excitons and resulting in enhanced luminescence.46 Such interaction appears to be unique for the P3HT–TiO2 interface as it is not observed in other common material systems such as P3HT/ZnO and P3HT/phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PBCM). Nonetheless, the relative intensities of the PL curves of the bi-layer and ordered-BHJ structures are in close agreement with the trends observed in IPCE measurements. For example, the degree of PL quenching in devices derived from nano-arrays B and C was greater than that from nano-array A or bilayer devices, and this corresponded with the higher IPCE values observed in devices from nano-arrays B and C. These observations suggest that the PL quenching, and hence exciton dissociation, could be governed by a combination of factors including surface area, polymer orientation and electronic interactions at the interface.
3.5 Improving ordered-bulk heterojunction OPV performance
To advance this area of research, it would be worthwhile investigating the effects of vacuum-annealing conditions (e.g. level of the applied vacuum and the rate of heating/cooling) on the P3HT orientation. Modifying the side chains of P3HT could also improve the polymer interaction with the TiO2 nanotube surface and thus the way the polymer chains organize. Interfacial interactions can also be altered by incorporating fullerenes and hole-injecting layers such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and MoO3 into the device system. It is also necessary to identify or develop a palette of complementary donor materials (e.g. planar small molecules or oligomers) that when confined would orientate in the direction favorable to charge transport. The degree of crystallinity in these materials has to be better than that achievable in P3HT. Alternatively to avoid confinement issues, amorphous materials of high hole mobility may be considered. We are in the process of evaluating some commercial and in-house synthesized materials for their orientation and charge transport properties under nano-confinement.
4. Conclusions
In summary, the physical properties of regio-regular P3HT infiltrated and confined in the cavities of vertically aligned TiO2 nanotube arrays were investigated. The vacuum-melt infiltration technique was successfully employed to ensure complete infiltration of P3HT into the TiO2 nano-arrays and optimisation of the P3HT/TiO2 interface for exciton dissociation. Ordered-bulk heterojunction solar cells fabricated from the hybrid system showed a 2- to 2.5-fold increase in the IPCE over a planar bilayer device (in line with literature reports), and the increase is attributed to the increase in the surface area conferred by the nanotube arrays. On the other hand, the increase in performance is less than what one might expect from the ∼4 to 9.5-fold increase in the effective surface area. We postulated that besides surface area, the crystallinity and orientation of nano-confined P3HT played a more critical role in influencing the charge separation and transport processes in the device. A slight decrease in crystallinity was observed in nano-confined P3HT compared with non-confined P3HT. XRD studies further revealed that nano-confined P3HT chains were aligned edge-on with respect to the underlying substrate, an orientation that is non-ideal for transport of charges from the exciton dissociation interface to the electrodes. The P3HT alignment was the same regardless of the degree of confinement in the nanotube arrays or the regio-regularity of P3HT. As charge transport in P3HT occurs predominantly along the polymer chain and in the π–π stacking direction, transport and hence device efficiencies can potentially be improved if the polymer chains are aligned face-on or vertical to the substrate. This finding can be extended to other nano-confined polymer systems, and should serve as a reference for improving conversion efficiencies in ordered-bulk heterojunction solar cells.

 	Fig. 1  (a) Schematic representation of an ideal ordered-BHJ device structure featuring inter-digitated donor–acceptor domains sandwiched between two electrodes. Plane view field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) images of anodized aluminium oxide (AAO) templates (b–d) and the corresponding TiO2 nanotube arrays (e–g) prepared via the liquid-phase atomic layer deposition (LALD) of TiO2 (10 nm) on the AAO templates followed by template removal.	 



Nano-array A	Anodized at 20 V, 0.2 M sulfuric acid, 30 min pore widening	150	50	75	225	9.5
Nano-array B	Anodized at 60 V 0.3 M oxalic acid, 75 min pore widening	150	90	120	60	5.5
Nano-array C	Anodized at 120 V 0.3 M phosphoric acid, 180 min pore widening	150	185	300	20	4.3

 	Fig. 2  (a) Schematic representation of the vacuum melt infiltration process where P3HT is melted under elevated temperatures and drawn into the TiO2 nano-arrays as the applied vacuum removes air from the nano-array cavities (black arrows). The FESEM cross-sections of the P3HT/TiO2 nano-array system after annealing at 250 °C under (b) atmospheric pressure and (d) 20 mTorr, and their corresponding plane views (c and e, respectively). When treated under atmospheric pressure, voids can be seen in the nano-arrays and the P3HT overlayer remained smooth. In contrast, voids are absent when the system was treated under vacuum, and there was complete intercalation of P3HT with the nano-arrays, with the tips of the nanotubes clearly visible. All scale bars represent 150 nm.	 

 	Fig. 3  Normalized absorption spectra of non-confined and nano-confined P3HT. All films were vacuum-annealed at 250 °C and 20 mTorr for 1 hour.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Out-of-plane XRD pattern of P3HT in nano-array A. The diffraction pattern is similar for P3HT on glass or planar TiO2 (non-confined), or in nano-array B or C (nano-confined). (b) XRD spectrum of non-confined and nano-confined P3HT with magnified views in (c–e) showing (c) the relative intensities of the (100) peak; (d) the family of (100) planes corresponding to the lamellar44 planes characteristic of P3HT; and (e) the absence of the peak at 23.6° (which when present indicates π–π stacking). (f) Schematic representation of the three preferred configurations that P3HT chains can adopt when deposited on a surface.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Incident-photon-to-converted-electron efficiency (IPCE) and (b) photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the P3HT/TiO2 samples.
