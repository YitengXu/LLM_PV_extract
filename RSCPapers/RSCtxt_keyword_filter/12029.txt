    , Accepted 16th September 2020First published on 17th September 2020AbstractIn general, it is hard to grow large single crystals with a one-dimensional chain structure due to the preferred growth direction and chain breakage. Most reported one-dimensional lead iodine chain single crystals can grow long, but they are difficult to grow thick. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the growth of 2 mm × 4 mm × 8 mm sized single crystal one dimensional organic lead iodine perovskite – DMAPbI3 ((CH3)2NH2PbI3). Benzylamine addition to the solution may help to dissolve crystals with high defect concentrations so that the crystal can grow larger. Through the measurement on the large single crystal, we found that DMAPbI3 is ferroelectric below 260 K, and the dielectric constant of DMAPbI3 at various frequencies at room temperature is as high as more than 100. Blue photoluminescence centered at 2.6 eV was reported. The ferroelectricity of DMAPbI3 may be used to design more stable and efficient organometal halide perovskite solar cells and photoelectric devices.
Introduction
Perovskite structure materials with an ABX3 component have been studied intensively and extensively during the past decades due to their amazing variety of interesting properties, such as photovoltaic properties,1,2 ferroelectricity,3–12 ferromagnetism,13 superconductivity,14 multiferroicity,15etc. Since organometal halide perovskite solar cells were found to possess excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE),16–18 the design and growth of new organometal halide perovskite functional materials have attracted great attention. In recent years, many new molecular ferroelectrics have been found and studied,19–28 many of which are multifunctional materials with novel physicochemical properties. The ferroelectricity in methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) is widely studied through different kinds of methods.29–33 But whether MAPbI3 has ferroelectricity is still controversial. Some believe that the existence of polar domains in MAPbI3 can induce charge separation, lowers charge recombination, and allows high conductivity due to local degeneracy of the semiconductor along the domain walls.34,35 The others prove that MAPbI3 polycrystalline films do not have ferroelectricity.36,37 Different synthetic methods and cell architectures can affect the final efficiency of MAPbI3 solar cells, implying that various factors can affect the photovoltaic efficiency.33 The bulk photovoltaic effect, which usually exists in ferroelectric materials, may contribute greatly to the high-power conversion efficiency of hybrid halide perovskite solar cells. Therefore, research on the ferroelectricity of hybrid halide perovskite materials may be helpful to study the photovoltaic properties of hybrid halide perovskite solar cells.
1D organic–inorganic hybrids have attracted great attention due to their good moisture resistance and excellent optoelectronic properties.38 In 1D chain compounds, 1D inorganic chains are separated by organic cations to form a quantum wire structure, in which charge carriers are confined within the 1D inorganic framework.39 Research on 1D organic–inorganic hybrids may have promising application prospects. However, large 1D chain single crystals are hard to grow due to the chain breakage and preferred growth direction. The thinnest side of most reported 1D organic lead iodine single crystals is less than 0.5 mm.
DMAPbI3 ((CH3)2NH2PbI3) is a 1D perovskite consisting of infinite chains of face sharing [PbI6] octahedra separated by chains of DMA cations. The structure of DMAPbI3 is similar to that of δ phase FAPbI3. Both DMAPbI3 and δ-FAPbI3 can be used as stable parts in Cs/MA/FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells.40–44 In the literature, the size of single crystal DMAPbI3 is small with the thinnest side less than 0.2 mm. Here we report a new method to synthesize large single crystals of 2 mm × 4 mm × 8 mm. As far as we know, it is the largest 1D lead iodine single crystal ever reported. DMAPbI3 has a phase transition at around 261 K. García-Fernández et al. reported that the low temperature phase of DMAPbI3 is the P21/c structure.45,46 But we measured a ferroelectric hysteresis loop in the DMAPbI3 single crystals, indicating a polar structure of low temperature phase. The temperature dependent dielectric constant measured on the single crystals shows switchable behaviour. The dielectric constant is as high as more than 100. The UV–visible absorption spectrum shows that DMAPbI3 has a direct band gap of 2.58 eV.
Experimental
Synthesis
0.5 mmol benzylamine and 1 mmol PbI2 were mixed in 10 ml DMF. Then 5 ml hydroiodic acid (57% wt) was dropped into the solution. 2 ml 50% phosphorous acid solution was added to stabilize hydroiodic acid. A clear yellow solution was formed finally. Large single crystals of DMAPbI3 were acquired by evaporation of the solution at room temperature for about two weeks.
Measurement section
Elemental analysis was carried out on a Heraeus CHN-0-Rapid elemental analyser. The absorption spectra were measured on a PV Measurements model QEX10 using the integral sphere method from 300 nm to 1100 nm. Single crystal X-ray diffraction was performed using a Bruker D8 QUEST. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was performed on a Rigaku D/MAX 2000 PC X-ray diffractometer. DSC measurements of the single crystals were recorded by using a NETZSCH DSC 200F3 in the temperature range of 100–300 K. The complex permittivity was measured using a Tonghui TH2828A LCR meter. The photoluminescence spectra were detected by time resolved fluorescence spectroscopy (FLSP20, Edinburgh, lhstrcamenss). The absorption spectra were measured using a quantum efficiency tester. Raman spectra were collected using a Horiba Jobin Yvon HR800 spectrometer device by means of a 488 nm laser line. P–E hysteresis loops were recorded on a Precision Premier II (Radiant Technologies, Inc.) using a Sawyer–Tower circuit.
Results and discussion
In previous work, the raw material used for crystal growth of DMAPbI3 is dimethylamine. Here, dimethylamine comes from the reaction of DMF and hydroiodic acid (DMF + HI + H2O → DMAI + HCOOH). Benzylamine was added to assist the growth of DMAPbI3 large crystals. Without addition of benzylamine, the acquired DMAPbI3 single crystals are usually small and have poor quality. With benzylamine addition to the solution, millimetre-size single crystals can be easily acquired. Fig. 1(a) shows the digital photo of the large single crystal of DMAPbI3 grown from this method. The crystal size is about 2 mm × 4 mm × 8 mm. It has been reported that benzylamine can protect MAPbI3 solar cells from photo-oxidative degradation.47,48 Here, it is found that benzylamine can assist the growth of 1D DMAPbI3. Without the addition of benzylamine, many small crystals are formed and it is hard for them to grow into large crystals. Fig. S1† shows the microscopy photo of small cuboid shape DMAPbI3 single crystals at the beginning of the crystal growth without the addition of benzylamine. Obviously, the density of the nucleus site is high. After some time, the regular shape single crystals continue to grow. The single crystal shape become irregular (Fig. S2†). There are two kinds of crystal shapes, irregular cuboid and hexagon. The hexagon shape single crystal is not clear. With benzylamine addition, the shape of the single crystals grown from the solution is similar to that without benzylamine addition. But the addition of benzylamine can greatly reduce the number of crystal nuclei and help the crystals grow into large crystals. This finding may be helpful for understanding the protection mechanism of benzylamine in MAPbI3 solar cells. A possible mechanism for the action of benzylamine is proposed. Benzylamine can react with HI and PbI2 to form (benzylammonium)2PbI4(BA2PbI4). At room temperature, the solubility of BA2PbI4 is much higher than that of DMAPbI3. At the beginning of the growth process, only DMAPbI3 crystals can grow due to the differences in saturation solubility. It is known that the growth of crystals from solution is a dynamic equilibrium process. During the growth process, the crystals that have grown can be re-dissolved. Benzylamine may re-dissolve the part with more defects in the DMAPbI3 crystal by forming BAPbI4 so that a large DMAPbI3 single crystal with good quality can be formed.

The structure of the acquired single crystals was confirmed by both single crystal X-ray diffraction and powder X-ray diffraction (Fig. 1). The single crystal XRD data were solved using SHELXTL. When solving the structure of the crystal, it is hard to determine the space group. Five possible space groups were given by the Xprep method, namely, P1c, P31c, P6(3)mc, P6(3)/mmc and P2c. But the CFOM values of the five possible space groups are all too large. The least CFOM is 10.32 for P1c. From the view of crystallography, it is hard to determine the real space group of 1D DMAPbI3, which is similar to that of MAPbX3 (X = Cl, Br and I). Whether MAPbX3 (X = Cl, Br and I) is polar is still controversial.49 Based on previous work, P6(3)/mmc is the space group with the highest symmetry, so P6(3)/mmc is chosen as the space group of DMAPbI3. The structure can be solved very well with the P6(3)/mmc structure. However, considering the large CFOM, the P6(3)/mmc space group is not so believable. We believe that DMAPbI3 may have a polar phase or have a polar part in the single crystals at room temperature.
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was also performed to examine the structure of the acquired single crystals (Fig. 2(b)). The measured PXRD pattern corresponds well with that simulated from the solved structure. Both single crystal XRD and PXRD prove that large 1D DMAPbI3 single crystals can be grown with this modified method. Compared with the methods reported before,45,50 the growth method we developed is different and easier, without heating and recrystallization.
 Fig. 2  (a) DSC curves of DMAPbI3 measured at 10 K min−1. (b) The temperature dependent real part of the dielectric constant in the heating process and the cooling process. 
The temperature-dependent DSC curves (Fig. 2a) show an endothermic peak at 260.8 K in the heating process and an exothermic peak at around 251.4 K with a hysteresis of 9.4 K, indicating that a phase transition happened. It was reported by García-Fernández that the endothermic peak is at 257 K (Tc) and the exothermic peak is at 250 K with a hysteresis loop of 7 K. The phase transition temperature of the DMAPbI3 synthesized by our group is higher than the reported one, which may be due to different defect concentrations. In addition, the enthalpy change (ΔH) in the heating process is found to be 9434 J mol−1 and the enthalpy change (ΔH) in the cooling process is found to be 10575 J mol−1. The enthalpy changes obtained by our group are almost four times that reported by García-Fernández. The larger enthalpy in the crystal we have grown may be because the larger crystals have more chain breakage defects, and therefore have a greater defect energy. The large enthalpy changes and the large hysteresis both prove that the DMAPbI3 grown by this method has a more order–disorder transition change level. The defects introduced by benzylamine and the mixed solvent may be responsible for the disorder level change.
According to the single crystal XRD of DMAPbI3 performed below Tc by García-Fernández, the DMAPbI3 single crystal is twinned at low temperature. One of these twin domains was used to solve the crystal structure. The low-temperature structure that we gave can only be used as a reference, and there are errors in the crystal structure data. The space group of DMAPbI3 at low temperature was determined to be P21 considering the ferroelectricity at low temperature. At room temperature, DMA in the crystal is disordered (Fig. 1c). But below Tc, DMA is totally ordered (Fig. 1d). Single crystal XRD indicates that the phase transition at Tc is an order–disorder phase transition. Near the phase transition temperature, the spatial position of DMA group rotates. The direction of the largest area of the single crystal is along the b axis of the P21 phase, which is the polar direction of the P21 space group. Due to the characteristics of twins, it is difficult to determine the absolute configuration of the crystal.
Temperature dependent dielectric measurements were taken on the (100) face of the single crystal at different frequencies (Fig. 2b). The dielectric phase transition of the single crystal has lower frequency dependence above the phase transition temperature than that of the pelletized polycrystalline sample. The dielectric phase transition of the DMAPbI3 single crystal shows a switchable behaviour with a sharp transition, which is different from the slow change of the polycrystalline sample. The difference may originate from the different sizes of the crystal and grain interface. It is worth noting that this dielectric phase change has reached 50%, implying that the phase transition may be a ferroelectric phase transition. The switchable dielectric may originate from the order–disorder phase transition of the system and the changing dynamics of the polar dimethylammonium (DMA) cation. In addition, the dielectric constant at room temperature at various frequencies is as high as more than 100. For comparison, the dielectric constant of (CH3)3NCH2IPbI3 with a similar 1D chain structure is below 20.8 Meanwhile, the dielectric loss is very small. Even at 500 Hz, the dielectric loss is below 0.5 (Fig. S7 and S8†).
To examine the ferroelectricity of DMAPbI3, the ferroelectric hysteresis loop was measured with 50 Hz at different temperatures (Fig. 3). Above 260 K, the ferroelectric loop looks like a leakage current loop. It is hard to distinguish whether the sample is ferroelectric or not. But at about 237–231 K, the ferroelectric hysteresis loop presents parallelogram shapes, indicating that DMAPbI3 is ferroelectric below 260 K. The spontaneous polarization of DMAPbI3 along the (100) direction is about 0.2 μC cm−2 and the coercive field is only 1 kV cm−1.
 Fig. 3  The ferroelectric hysteresis loop of DMAPbI3 measured at the (100) face with 50 Hz frequency. 
The dielectric transition does not obey the Curie–Weiss law but shows a switchable behaviour. So 1D DMAPbI3 is an improper ferroelectric in which the ferroelectric phase is caused by some physical quantities other than the polarization.
According to the result of García-Fernández, below the phase transition temperature, the crystal structure was refined as a 3-component twin. The space group was determined as P21/c. The R factor for all data is 9.6% and the wR factor for all data is 19.01%. P21/c belongs to the centrosymmetric space group, which cannot introduce ferroelectricity in DMAPbI3. In many cases, it is difficult to determine whether a crystal has a central symmetry based only on crystallographic data. In addition to crystallographic data, piezoelectricity, pyroelectricity, ferroelectricity and SHG are usually used to determine whether a crystal has a central symmetry. The ferroelectric hysteresis loop measured on DMAPbI3 suggests a polar space group at low temperature. The twin crystal would make it harder to determine the space group. So polar P21 is more conceivable than P21/c.
The absorption spectra of the DMAPbI3 powder were measured (Fig. 4). For direct band gap optical transition, the optical coefficient α corresponds to the Kubelka–Munk function ((αhν)2 = C(hv − Eg), Eg is the band gap energy). Fig. 4a shows the absorption spectrum measured with the integral sphere method. The (αhν)2–hν curve indicates that the optical band gap of the DMAPbI3 is 2.58 eV, which originates from the direct band gap.

In addition to the ferroelectric materials, DMAPbI3 shows intriguing luminescence due to the optical band. Under ambient light, the crystal is clear yellow. However, when irradiated with 365 nm ultraviolet light, the crystal emits blue light. The insert picture in Fig. 4b shows the photo of the crystals when irradiated by 10 W 365 nm UV light. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were also measured. When the DMAPbI3 polycrystalline sample was excited by 200 nm UV light, a clear PL peak centred at 2.6 eV appears. The PL peak corresponds well with the optical band indicating that the optical band originates from the direct band gap. DMAPbI3 is a good candidate for blue emitting materials.
Conclusions
In conclusion, large single crystals of 1D DMAPbI3 were grown with a modified solution method. Benzylamine was added to the solution to assist the growth of large crystals. Different from previous work, DMAI comes from the reaction of DMF and HI. Below 260 K, DMAPbI3 is ferroelectric with a spontaneous polarization of 0.2 μC cm−2 along the (100) direction. In addition to ferroelectric materials, DMAPbI3 shows blue luminescence, making it a good candidate for multifunctional materials.
