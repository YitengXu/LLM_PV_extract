    , Accepted 30th March 2023First published on 30th March 2023AbstractState-of-the-art and innovative research is being intensively employed on perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to expand their frontiers further. This study is a successful attempt to drive the limit of photocurrent density (Jsc) beyond conventional PSCs (which typically utilize the visible spectrum alone) through a nonlinear optical phenomenon called down-conversion (DC). The use of DC luminescence to harness the UV region from the solar spectrum is explored by utilizing Eu3+ activated RbCaF3, a fluoroperovskite-based phosphor material. It is observed that PSCs, which used RbCaF3:Eu3+ incorporated TiO2 electron transport layer (ETL), enhanced their Jsc and UV stability compared to those with pristine TiO2-oriented ETL. Such improvement in the aforementioned devices is due to the result of converting high-energy UV photons to effectively absorbable low-energy visible photons for perovskite absorbers. Overall, the DC-aided PSC offered a substantial Jsc of 23.54 mA cm−2 (9.2% superior to the conventional PSC) and boosted its power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 11.2% to 13.3%. It is evident that DC-based PSCs show a much better shelf-life when compared to conventional PSCs. This unique approach for boosting the Jsc with enhanced stability can be utilized for the potential applications of PSCs.
1 Introduction
Perovskite solar cells are theoretically less expensive to make in large quantities when compared to silicon solar cells (SiSCs). For the commercialization of PSCs, we have to overcome its bottlenecks (i) by replacing the pricey materials in PSCs, (ii) by ameliorating the stability and (iii) by improving the device performance (current density and PCE).1–3 To replace the expensive metal electrode (Au or Ag) and unstable organic hole transport material (Spiro OMeTAD, which is a pricier one), a low-cost conductive carbon electrode was substituted for both. This architecture is called carbon electrode-based perovskite solar cells (C-PSC).4,5 In terms of stability, PSCs are well known for their susceptibility to moisture and UV light. Though the hydrophobic nature of carbon electrodes protects the C-PSC from moisture, poor stability due to UV light is still challenging.6 In the entire solar spectrum, PSCs (based on conventional MAPbI3) exclusively absorb photons in the visible region because of their bandgap (∼1.5 eV). Conversely, photons with lower energy (infrared light) are easily transmitted through the device and are not absorbed by PSCs.7,8 However, photons with higher energy (blue-ultraviolet region) generate hot electron–hole pairs, which are vulnerable to the perovskite layer.9 These hot electron–hole pairs trigger the dissociation of organic cations in perovskites. Furthermore, this dissociation can be considerably accelerated by the presence of oxygen in the air or the device.10,11 However, under such high-energy ultraviolet (UV) light, the mesoporous TiO2 layer, which serves as the electron transport layer (ETL), produces oxygen vacancies (due to oxygen desorption) on the surface of TiO2 owing to its excellent photocatalytic effect. These oxygen vacancies act as a trap center between the interface of the TiO2/perovskite layer and further reduce the performance of PSCs.10 Therefore, unless a solution for this UV-based deterioration in PSCs is found, it is extremely challenging to bring this to the market.
In this vein, we attempted to tackle both of the aforementioned challenges (i.e., UV stability and current density) in PSCs with a nonlinear optical phenomenon known as down-conversion (DC), where a high-energy UV photon is converted into multiple low-energy visible photons. In addition, to defend PSCs from UV degradation, this DC phenomenon extends the device spectral response range, which increases the count of an absorbable photon to the perovskite. Consequently, the photocurrent density and PCE of the respective devices are enhanced.
Owing to the profitable qualities, such as long life and rich transition channels (f–f and d–f transitions), rare-earth trivalent ions, such as Ce3+, Pr3+, Nd3+, Sm3+, Eu3+, Tb3+ and Dy3+, play a major role in various optical applications, such as lasers, light emitting diodes and displays.12,13 Because of their abundant discrete energy levels, such trivalent lanthanide ions are suitable for DC.14 Photovoltaic researchers are using the DC ability to protect solar cells from UV light and to improve their performance by increasing the photon count.15 Among the earlier-mentioned elements, Eu3+ is considered one of the most efficient down-converting lanthanide ions with the highest intensity of emission.16 Depending on the host matrix, this Eu3+ re-emits the photons in the wavelength range of 575–700 nm.14,17 Because it is well known that the perovskite absorption spectrum has minimal absorption in the tail of the visible region, choosing a host material that allows Eu3+ to re-emit at a shorter wavelength is a wiser choice.
Nowadays, researchers are focusing on fluoride-based host materials that have peculiar features that aid in the conversion of high-energy UV photons to low-energy visible photons. Consequently, they can boost the number of usable photons in solar cells and lighting systems to enhance their efficiency and performance. Among the various fluoride materials, perovskite-type fluoride materials (ABF3), also known as fluoroperovskite, are much more interesting because of their excellent physical, chemical, mechanical and thermal stability, which makes them suitable for use in harsh environments.17,18 The non-toxicity and low-cost synthesis of fluoroperovskite are making it attractive for use in consumer products with large-scale production. The wide range of emissions is the main advantage of the perovskite structure, which provides opportunities to tune the down-conversion properties for specific applications with a re-emission ranging from blue to red.19 Moreover, the high optical transparency of the perovskite-structured fluoride materials makes them very useful for developing transparent electrodes.17 In addition, fluoroperovskites doped with lanthanide ions have a long life, tunable colour emission and are environmentally friendly, making them supportive in the improvement of the performance of PSCs. Although such fluoroperovskite is used in many applications, such as amplifiers, solid-state lasers, lightings and dosimetry, it is very rarely used in solar cells.
Raja et al. utilized rubidium magnesium fluoride (RbMgF3), a fluoroperovskite host material, to dope Eu3+ and spotted that it re-emits the absorbed UV light at a wavelength of 610 nm.17 Though the re-emission at this wavelength is adequate for perovskite absorbers, there is still the potential to pull the re-emission towards a shorter wavelength. Hence, we investigate the application of Eu3+-activated rubidium calcium fluoride (RbCaF3) as a DC phosphor in PSCs. Several promising photo-physical assets of RbCaF3 such as low phonon energy, high quantum energy, optical transparency, high thermal and mechanical durability, and high radiation opposition triggered us to employ it as a host for the most efficient Eu3+ lanthanide ion. With this novel combination of RbCaF3 with Eu3+ ion, we recognized its potential optical properties to utilize its luminescence for photovoltaic applications. Moreover, this RbCaF3 plays a major role in ensuring the re-emission of Eu3+ predominantly at a wavelength of ∼590 nm (instead of ∼610 nm) by creating the inverse symmetry site in which the activator ion resides.
We investigated the effect of the DC phenomenon of this RbCaF3:Eu3+ in the simple and economical HTM (hole transport material) free C-PSC. The so-called devices are integrated as FTO-coated glass substrate/c-TiO2/m-TiO2 (with and without RbCaF3-based DC phosphors)/MAPbI3/carbon electrodes. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report on such an application of fluoroperovskite-based DC phosphors in HTM-free C-PSC to improve current density and stability economically.
In this study, we used a simple solid-state reaction method to synthesize Eu3+-activated RbCaF3 phosphors, and it was included in a mesoporous TiO2 layer to achieve a better ETL with an extended spectral response range for PSCs. The processed ETL was further developed into a fully fabricated device, and the performance of the RbCaF3:Eu3+ added TiO2 layer was studied extensively. From the photovoltaic characterizations, it is evident that the PSC without DC phosphors (RbCaF3:Eu3+) failed to utilize the UV photons, which results in a low current density of 21.56 mA cm−2. Simultaneously, the PSC with RbCaF3:Eu3+ included TiO2-based ETL has effectively converted high-energy UV photons into low-energy visible photons. This phenomenon is attributed to stream extra photo-generated carriers from the perovskite absorber, which in turn improved the current density of the device from 21.56 to 23.54 mA cm−2. Moreover, although numerous studies on PSCs claim the current density of 20 ± 2 mA cm−2,14,20,21 our synthesized fluoroperovskite-based DC phosphors enhanced the device current density to 23.54 mA cm−2, which is 86.5% of the theoretical maximum Jsc (27.2 mA cm−2).22 Furthermore, we achieved that the incorporation of RbCaF3:Eu3+ into TiO2 protects the devices well from UV-oriented degradation, and it is discussed elaborately.

Carbon paste was purchased from Dyenamo. All the chemicals were utilized directly without any further purification.
2.2 Characterization of films and devices
XRD analysis of powder and films was performed using a PANalytical X-ray diffractometer with a monochromatic CuKα (1.54056 Å) radiation source. Morphological studies of the synthesized phosphors were performed using FE-SEM (SUPRA 55) – CARL ZEISS, Germany. SEM images with EDAX and elemental mapping were analyzed by SEM (EVO 18) – CARL ZEISS. Surface analysis of the perovskite layers was performed using FE-SEM (CARL ZEISS, Model: RA-ZEI-001). UV-vis absorption, diffused reflectance and transmittance spectra of the phosphors, as well as films, were measured using a UV-vis NIR spectrophotometer, UV-2600i with ISR 2600 Plus (Shimadzu, Japan). Photoluminescence excitation and emission were studied by employing a spectrofluorometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon Fluoromax – 4) equipped with an excitation source of 150 W Xe. XPS measurement for the elemental analysis of the DC-integrated ETL was performed using XPS, PHI Versaprobe III. The J–V measurement of the fabricated devices was done using a solar simulator (Class-AAA, Science Tech) equipped with a Keithley source meter under one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2). The IPCE spectrum with an integrated current density was measured using QE-R (Enlitech, Taiwan).
2.3 Synthesis of DC phosphors
The RbCaF3:Eu3+ phosphors were synthesized through the conventional high-temperature solid-state reaction (SSR) method: a low-cost, environmentally friendly, and toxic-free method.23 Laconically, the equimolar stoichiometric ratios of analytical grade raw materials of rubidium fluoride (RbF), calcium fluoride (CaF2) and 0.5 mol% europium fluoride (EuF3) were balanced, followed by homogeneously mixing it in an agate mortar using a pestle. The finely ground powder was transferred to an alumina crucible, and it was sintered in a muffle furnace at 850 °C for 12 h, followed by cooling to room temperature naturally. Finally, the grinding of the obtained product yielded a fine powder, which was then subjected to various characterizations.
2.4 Fabrication of C-PSC with synthesized DC phosphors
The part of the substrate cleaning process and the preparation of precursor and colloidal solutions are presented in the ESI.† To form a compact TiO2 (c-TiO2) layer over the cleaned FTO-coated glass substrates, the c-TiO2 precursor solution was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s and sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. To develop various wt% of DC phosphors added to m-TiO2 layers, the respective colloidal solution was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 20 s on the c-TiO2 layer and sintered at 450 °C for 30 min to evaporate the binder materials from the m-TiO2 layer. To perform titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) treatment on the surface of the m-TiO2 layer, 2 ml of TiCl4 solution was added to 100 ml of DI water at 0 °C, and the substrates were immersed into that solution with the m-TiO2 layer facing upward. The setup is then maintained at 70 °C for 30 min, and the substrates were washed with ethanol, followed by sintering at 450 °C for 30 min. Thus, efficient ETLs with various weight percentages of DC phosphors were successfully developed for the vital perovskite layer part of the device.
The deposition of the perovskite layer was done using the hot-casting method in an argon atmosphere with <0.1 ppm of both oxygen and H2O. Moreover, the prepared MAPbI3 precursor solution was spin-coated by a two-step spin coating method at 1000 rpm for 10 s and 6000 rpm for 30 s over the pre-annealed architecture of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2 (with and without DC material). Then, the substrates were immediately annealed at 110 °C for 20 min. Finally, the carbon electrode was coated on the produced perovskite layer using the doctor blading technique and annealed at 120 °C for 20 min.
The pristine TiO2 layer and the layers with 5 wt%, 10 wt% and 15 wt% of DC phosphors containing TiO2 are labelled as 0-DCP, 5-DCP, 10-DCP and 15-DCP, respectively, to specify the term down conversion phosphors.
In this way, we constructed 10 devices at a time for each variation to study the reproducibility of the devices. The performance of all the fabricated devices was studied using J–V characteristics. The active area of the device was defined to be 0.25 cm2 by a metal mask, and the device that shows the highest performance in each variant is taken as a champion device. Moreover, the average performance of the 10 devices in each variant studied is analyzed with the statistical boxplot of the J–V parameters and the PCE distribution histogram in a later section.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Characteristic confirmation of synthesized RbCaF3:Eu3+ phosphors

Fig. 1(a) shows the PXRD pattern obtained for the synthesized Eu3+-activated polycrystalline RbCaF3 phosphors. RbCaF3 crystallized in the cubic system with a perovskite-type cubic structure in a space group of Pmm (221).23 The main diffraction peaks of the sample at 19.90°, 28.29°, 34.84°, 40.44°, 45.67°, 50.11°, 58.56°, 62.63°, 66.29° and 69.97° are assigned to the diffraction planes of (100), (110), (111), (200), (210), (211), (220), (300), (310) and (311), respectively. These diffraction planes with their respective peaks agree with the standard powder diffraction file (PDF) card no. 84-0440 (as shown in Fig. 1(a)), which infers that the synthesized Eu3+ doped RbCaF3 is in its pure phase without any other impurities. The strongest diffraction peak at the (110) plane indicates that the synthesized phosphors grow majorly on the corresponding plane. Using the Scherrer equation and assuming that the particles are stress-free, the crystallite size of the synthesized RbCaF3:Eu3+ phosphors is calculated from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) value of the strongest peak at 28.29°. The calculated crystallite size of the sample is ∼52 nm.
 Fig. 1  (a) PXRD and (b) UV-vis absorption spectrum of RbCaF3:Eu3+. 
The photon absorption behaviour of the synthesized phosphors was studied using the UV-vis absorption spectrum, as shown in Fig. 1(b). It is evident that the synthesized material exhibits strong absorption in the UV region and better transmission in the entire visible region. However, the embedded information in the spectrum is particularly useful for understanding the excitation spectrum of photoluminescence. Generally, to emit radiation, a luminescent material should absorb excitation energy. In this sense, several peaks are observed in the absorption spectrum, starting from the high-energy side (i.e., short wavelength).
(i) A very strong absorption region is observed at λ ≤ 240 nm (black), which is responsible for the absorption by the RbCaF3 host lattice (HL).
(ii) An overlapped band in the absorption edge is spotted in the range of 240–350 nm (blue-colored and apparent in the PL excitation spectrum), which is due to the Eu3+–O2− charge transfer (CT) transition.
(iii) In the range of 350–800 nm (red), multiple weak absorption peaks are noted (shown in the inset), corresponding to the transitions within the 4f6 configuration of Eu3+.24 Moreover, all the peaks in the region (shown in the inset) match well with the PL excitation spectrum.
The presence of HL absorption, CT transition and transitions within the Eu3+ 4f6 configuration confirms that there is a transfer of energy from the host to the activator (Eu3+).
Fig. S1† shows the diffused reflectance spectrum of the Eu3+-activated RbCaF3 phosphors. The spectrum indicates that the incident photons in the visible region are scattered within the phosphors and give more than 90% reflectance in the respective regions using their trapping ability. Hence, it is evident from both the UV-vis absorbance and diffused reflectance spectrum that the synthesized DC phosphors efficiently absorb the photons in the UV region for DC and effectively transmit the visible region photons through scattering for the perovskite absorber, respectively.
The successful doping of trivalent Eu ions into the RbCaF3 matrix was further demonstrated by the PL excitation and emission spectrum, and they are shown in Fig. 2 with an illustrated diagram of the energy transition process. By monitoring the emission of Eu3+ at 590 nm, an excitation spectrum was acquired. As discussed in the UV-vis absorption spectrum, the charge transfer band (CTB) between O2− and Eu3+ produces a broad excitation band between the wavelengths of 280 and 350 nm.
 Fig. 2  PL excitation and emission spectrum of RbCaF3:Eu3+ with energy transition diagram. 
With the peaks at 385 and 465 nm (due to 7F0 → 5L7 and 7F0 → 5D2, respectively), the excitation spectra showed the strongest excitation peak at 394 nm, which corresponds to the intra-configurational f–f forbidden transition (7F0 → 5L6) of Eu3+ ions.25 Therefore, when the phosphor material was excited at the wavelength of 394 nm, the energy from the charge transfer band non-radiatively relaxed to a lower excited 5D3 state and further to 5D2 → 5D1 → 5D0, as illustrated in the energy transition diagram. Owing to a grander energy gap between the lowest excited states 5D0 → 7Fj, multiple emission peaks corresponding to various colours were observed in the visible region at wavelengths of 576, 591, 616, 642 and 700 nm, which are accountable for 5D0 → 7F0, 5D0 → 7F1, 5D0 → 7F2, 5D0 → 7F3 and 5D0 → 7F4 electronic transitions, respectively. The more intense peak at 591 nm due to the 5D0 → 7F1 transition (magnetic dipole transition) indicates that the trivalent Eu ion is situated in the RbCaF3 matrix with inversion symmetry.17,26 Otherwise (i.e., if it is situated with non-inversion symmetry), the dominant transition is 5D0 → 7F2 (at 616 nm), which is termed a hypersensitive forced electric dipole transition. In this way, RbCaF3 was successfully utilized to tailor the emission of Eu3+ ions. Moreover, the emission at 576 nm contributes to the perovskite layer in the effective absorption of visible photons, as discussed in the Introduction section.

Fig. 3 shows the FE-SEM images of the synthesized fluoro-phosphors in various spatial resolutions (1000 and 200 nm). Both Fig. 3(a) and (b) indicate that the sample has a distribution of various grain sizes, which is mainly due to the formation of clusters through good agglomeration with each other. It is also found that the phosphors have minimum and maximum sizes in the range of ∼50–1500 nm. Furthermore, the cubic-surfaced facet of the phosphors is observed in both images, which are boxed in pink. In addition to the cubic facets, a mixture of polygonal or irregularly shaped phosphors of various sizes is observed. Such a combination of cubic or multi facets may be the reason for the light scattering and trapping ability (which are discussed in the diffused reflectance part) of the respective DC phosphors, and this leads to the provision of multiple photons to the perovskite absorber.14,27,28 A schematic diagram of the plausible diffusion, scattering and trapping of light due to such different-sized cubic or multi-facets and irregularly shaped materials is shown in Fig. S2.†

3.2 Film characterizations
To study the effect of the inclusion of DC phosphors in the TiO2 film, XRD measurement was taken for samples 0 and 15-DCP, and the obtained XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 4. Sample 0-DCP exhibits typical diffraction planes of (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), (204), (116), (220) and (215), which correspond to the anatase phase of TiO2 alone with peak positions of 25.34°, 37.90°, 47.99°, 54.11°, 55.13°, 62.92°, 69.04°, 70.14° and 75.10°.29
 Fig. 4  XRD pattern of 0-DCP and 15-DCP films. 
However, an increase in a new peak at the peak position of 28.31° is found in sample 15-DCP, which is responsible for the (110) plane of RbCaF3 and can correlate well with the obtained PXRD pattern of RbCaF3:Eu3+ (Fig. 1(a)). Moreover, the XRD pattern of both films confirms that the inclusion of DC phosphors in the TiO2 layer does not affect the original phase of each material after it is sintered up to 450 °C.
The elemental existence of RbCaF3:Eu3+ with TiO2 in ETL was confirmed by XPS measurement, and the results of the XPS measurement of sample 10-DCP are shown in Fig. 5. From the XPS spectrum's survey scan, besides the C signal, the peak corresponding to Ti, O, Rb, Ca, F and Eu confirmed that the Eu3+-activated RbCaF3 exists in the respective TiO2 layer. The high-resolution (HR) XPS spectra of Ti and O are shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b), respectively. For the Ti 2p spectrum, the two individual peaks at the binding energy of 458.1 and 463.8 eV with a split value (ΔE) of 5.7 eV are, respectively, accountable for Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2, which confirmed the existence of Ti with oxide. These peak positions are very close to the reported values, and they confirm that the chemical state of titanium is in Ti4+ oxidative state.30–34 The obtained O 1s spectrum is shown in Fig. 5(c), and it combines two peaks. The peak at lower binding energy (529.2 eV) is responsible for the metal oxide (simply called lattice oxygen (O–Ti)), and the peak at higher binding energy (532.4 eV) is responsible for the defective oxygen ions (due to oxygen vacancy or hydroxyl groups (O–H)). Ren et al. and Archana et al. reported similar results.33,35 The atomic percentages of both Ti 2p and O 1s were found to be 20.8 and 66.8%, respectively.

Furthermore, the deconvoluted high-resolution XPS spectrum of Rb 3d is shown in Fig. 5(d). The presence of Rb is confirmed by the two individual peaks, which represent Rb 3d5/2 and Rb 3d3/2 with binding energies of 109.3 and 110.8 eV, respectively. For the Ca 2p spectrum (Fig. 5(e)), the two different peaks at binding energies of 347.9 and 351.6 eV correspond to Ca 2p3/2 and Ca 2p1/2. The element fluorine is confirmed from the HR F 1s spectrum (Fig. 5(f)). Finally, the HR spectrum of Eu 3d evidenced that Eu is doped in the RbCaF3 by a peak at a binding energy of 153.2 eV, and the respective spectrum is shown in Fig. 5(g). The atomic percentages of the compositions Rb, Ca, F and Eu are 4.5, 1.1, 4.7 and 2.1%, respectively. Moreover, the composition of the 10-DCP ETL is tabulated, as depicted in Fig. 5(h). From the XPS results, the existence of synthesized Eu3+:RbCaF3 in TiO2-based ETL is confirmed with proper evidence.
Additionally, the surfaces of the pristine TiO2 and DC phosphors added TiO2 were studied by SEM analysis, and the elements on the surface of the film were further evaluated by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum and elemental analysis. A complete discussion of the SEM, EDX and elemental analysis results is provided in the ESI.†
The role of different wt% of DC phosphors in the behaviour of light absorption and transmission of the prepared ETL was studied with UV-vis absorption and transmittance spectra, respectively. The obtained absorbance spectrum is shown in Fig. 6(a), and it is apparent that the pristine TiO2 film exhibits complete transmittance in the visible region with a small absorbance in the UV region. When the DC phosphor wt% in the TiO2 layer is increased, the respective spectra also exhibit higher absorbance in the range of 300–400 nm. Notably, the increase in the small humps at the approximate wavelengths of 400 and 475 nm (which do not exist in the pristine TiO2 film) is due to the DC phosphors. Fig. S7† shows the transmittance spectrum of the same ETLs. From the lower to the higher-energy side, three grooves are observed in the transmittance spectrum of DC-incorporated ETLs, which are due to the respective phosphor absorption. The decrease in the transmittance and increment of absorbance in the range of 400–300 nm by incorporating DC phosphors in TiO2 ETL evidenced that the RbCaF3:Eu3+ efficiently absorbs a specific amount of UV light to provide an appropriate wavelength of photons to the perovskite absorber.
 Fig. 6  (a) UV-vis absorption spectrum of different ETLs and (b) XRD pattern of perovskite film over different ETLs. 
The influence of different wt% of DC phosphors containing ETL on the formation of the perovskite layer was studied using XRD measurement, and the XRD patterns of the prepared perovskite layer over different ETLs are shown in Fig. 6(b). The major peaks of the planes (110) and (220), respectively, at 14.08° and 28.39° confirm that the perovskite layer over different ETLs is formed with its tetragonal structure. When wt% of DC phosphors in ETL is increased, the intensity of the perovskite layer increases, which indicates that the inclusion of such fluoro-phosphors into m-TiO2 significantly aids in the crystallization of the perovskite layer. This may be due to the high surface area of the DC phosphors incorporated in ETL, which arises from the mixture of various sizes and structures of DC phosphors with the TiO2, as seen in the SEM image of the respective layer. Such high surface area due to the various sizes and structures of DC phosphors and TiO2 provides more adhesion, infiltration and nucleation sites to promote perovskite crystallization.19,36 It was further confirmed by the field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) imaging of the respective perovskite layer surface.

When compared to the perovskite films over DC-incorporated ETL, the film over 0-DCP shows some pin-holes. To conclude these defects, FE-SEM analysis was performed on the perovskite film coated over 0-DCP and 10-DCP-based ETLs at low (10k×) magnification, and the images are shown in Fig. S8.† The crystallized perovskite grains are in the size range of 2–3 μm. It is also evident that the roughness of the respective films is slightly higher when compared to that of the other perovskite films. We assume that such pin-holes are the reason for the lower diffraction peak intensity in the XRD measurement. Though the grain boundaries are larger in the perovskite film over 5-DCP-based ETL, it is found that the respective film is free from pinholes, and the roughness is quite low compared to that of the film over 0-DCP. Similarly, the perovskite film developed over 10-DCP and 15-DCP showed homogeneous and large grains free of pin holes. This result again shows that the incorporation of DC phosphors into ETL helps to provide a better scaffold for the crystallization of perovskite. Moreover, the largest perovskite grains over both 10 and 15-DCP are found to be ∼6 μm. In addition to the DC phosphors, the employment of the hot-casting method also leads to much larger perovskite grains.37 Hence, it is evident that the incorporation of DC phosphors into TiO2 ETL provides highly crystallized, homogeneous, large and pin-hole-free perovskite film. Such features significantly help to suppress charge carrier recombination.
The spectral absorbance property of the perovskite layer developed over different DCP-incorporated ETLs is studied using UV-vis absorbance and the results are shown in Fig. 8. It is evident that the absorption behaviour of the perovskite layer significantly depends on the amount of DC phosphors in the ETL. The absorption profile of the perovskite layer in the absorption spectrum increases as DC phosphors in the ETL increase. As we observed in previous studies, the increased crystallinity, homogeneity and reduced pinholes in the perovskite layer with increasing DC phosphors may be the reason for such an enhancement of the absorption profile with increasing DC phosphors. However, the light scattering property of the DC phosphors (due to their dimension) also plays a major role in the enhancement of absorption in perovskite.14 Moreover, the excitation peaks (particularly belonging to CTB) observed in the PL excitation spectrum are distinguished in the UV region of the absorption spectrum when the wt% of phosphor is increased, which confirms the occurrence of the DC phenomenon. Because we use a monochromatic light source to study the absorption spectrum, it is impossible to observe the PL emission in the UV-vis absorption spectrum. We were able to confirm the DC phenomenon through the corresponding excitation profile.

3.3 Photovoltaic characterizations
To study the contribution of different wt% of Eu3+-activated fluoroperovskite phosphors to the device performance and to obtain a convincing conclusion for those performances, 10 devices (C-PSC) in each variation were fabricated, as mentioned in the device fabrication part. The performance of the fabricated devices based on 0, 5, 10 and 15-DCP was assessed through photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) measurement. A summary of the statistical J–V parameters is tabulated in Table 1, and the J–V curve of the champion cell among each variant is shown in Fig. 9(a).

From these results, it is clear that the devices with pure TiO2 as the ETL have an average PCE of 11.0% with 20.41 mA cm−2 of short circuit current (Jsc), while the devices with 10-DCP exhibit an average PCE of 13.0% with Jsc of 23.12 mA cm−2. Compared to the device with unutilized RbCaF3:Eu3+, the device that utilized 10 wt% of the same improved the Jsc by ∼9.2%. A similar enhancement was observed in the previously reported studies.38–40 Such improvement was attributed to the extra visible photons emitted from the DC phosphors by absorbing the UV light that did not occur in the pre-stated device. In this way, we achieved a PCE of 13.3% for the champion cell (10-DCP) with Jsc of 23.54 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.992 V and 57% of FF. Such enhanced Jsc value (23.54 mA cm−2) is ∼86.5% of the theoretical maximum Jsc (27.2 mA cm−2).22 Though the utilized UV light contributes to the escalation of Jsc, the highly crystallized perovskite layer with pin-hole-free large grains over respective ETL contributes to the enhancement of both FF and Voc.
However, it is observed that the addition of more than 10 wt% of DC phosphors in the m-TiO2 layer decreases the cell performance by lowering its parameter values (particularly by Jsc). This contrast in the results may be due to the over wt% of phosphors, which is an insulating material and hence increases the cell resistance.41,42 Moreover, when the wt% of DC phosphors increases more than the optimum level (i.e., 15 wt%), there are possibilities for the formation of more grains, phases and domain interfaces in the ETL. They act as traps for the photo-generated electrons and holes, which hinder carrier transport and reduce the photocurrent. Hence, the Jsc increases and then decreases with an increase in DC phosphors. The power maximum (Pmax) of the champion device (10-DCP) was calculated, and the respective curves are shown in Fig. 9(b). The Pmax value of the champion device was found to be 3.33 mW.
As aforementioned, to demonstrate the reproducibility of the PSCs, 10 devices for each type (0, 5, 10 and 15-DCP) were constructed, and the relative statistical box-plot of the J–V parameter distribution is plotted, as illustrated in Fig. 10. The figure indicates that the incorporation of DC phosphors into the ETL did not affect the reproducibility of the devices. Undoubtedly, the lower PCE of the 0-DCP is mainly due to the lower Jsc of the same device. Moreover, the statistical boxplot reveals a significant improvement in 10-DCP-based devices in all the parameters, such as Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE (particularly in Jsc) when compared to the other variant-based devices. These findings suggest that the incorporation of DC phosphors into ETL could be a viable strategy for enhancing the performance of PSCs.

Fig. 11 depicts the PCE distribution histogram of the as-fabricated devices, and it indicates that all the sets of devices 0, 5, 10 and 15-DCP show good reproducibility with the average PCE of 11.0%, 12.2%, 13.0% and 12.6%, respectively. In addition, the distance between the peaks belonging to the PCE distribution curve of the 4 sets of devices highlights the significance of the DC process, which gives additional energy to the perovskite absorber by converting high-energy UV light into low-energy photons.

There is no doubt that the device performance improved significantly for the set of 10-DCP-oriented C-PSC. However, to further conclude that the enhancement was provided by the DC phosphors, incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) with integrated short circuit current was measured for the champion devices in each variant. The results are shown in Fig. 12(a). The obtained integrated Jsc values of the devices 0, 5, 10 and 15-DCP are 20.39, 21.05, 22.44 and 21.88 mA cm−2, respectively. These integrated Jsc values are slightly lower when compared to the values obtained from the J–V measurement. Such a decrease in Jsc values in the IPCE than in the J–V measurements may be due to the dependence of the respective parameters on the intensity of light. Because the IPCE measurements were performed under the monochromatic light source without any bias light, a lower charge carrier density, and a lower filling level of trap state were achieved when compared to the J–V measurement, which was performed under 1 sun illumination.43 Additionally, using such a monochromatic light source, it is impossible to observe the PL emission in the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum. We were able to confirm the DC phenomenon through the corresponding excitation profile. From the IPCE spectrum, it is apparent that the profiles of DC phosphors incorporated devices show enhancement in EQE at the wavelength region of 385, 394 and 465 nm. Such an enhancement of IPCE at the specified range is well correlated with the discussions on the optical studies of RbCaF3:Eu3+ phosphors, in which the same show better excitation features at the equivalent wavelength. Notably, the IPCE spectrum of devices 10 and 15-DCP showed enhancement throughout the wavelength range of 480–760 nm. This may be due to the effect of larger perovskite grains with better crystallinity and minimum grain boundaries (which are confirmed through XRD and FE-SEM), which may help to suppress carrier recombination. Hence, the EQE shows enhancement in the respective wavelength region, particularly for the higher amount of DC phosphors incorporated devices (10 and 15-DCP). Moreover, we believe that the light trapping or scattering centers of DC phosphors (due to the cubic and multi facets) and the different excitation profiles in the multi-layer system help to enhance the EQE throughout the spectrum.14,28 Among all the champion cells, the highest EQE of ∼80% was observed for the device based on 10-DCP, which already shows better features and performance in all the above discussions. Although the 15-DCP-based ETL was superior in their optical studies, its potential in device performance was reduced but not less than the device based on 5-DCP. Overall, the enhancement of Jsc over the spectral photoelectric response of PSCs is caused by photon re-emission from the phosphors.

3.4 Stability
Device stability is a major barrier to the commercialization of PSCs, and it is a critical issue to address. Therefore, to examine the effects of DC phosphor in terms of stability, all 4 variants of PSCs were tested by storing them under ambient conditions at room temperature without any encapsulation in a relative humidity range of ∼50–60%. Fig. 12(b) shows the recorded stability data of the aforementioned devices for 50 days. It is noted that DC-based devices exhibit better stability when compared to conventional PSC. However, unlike the results discussed in the device performance, the documented results of device stability differ somewhat. The addition of phosphor content to the m-TiO2 layer improves the stability of the device. The obtained retention PCE of the devices 0, 5, 10 and 15-DCP after 50 days under the ambient atmosphere is 64%, 77%, 78% and 83%, respectively. The highest retention PCE of the 15-DCP-based device may be due to the larger amount of RbCaF3:Eu3+ phosphor in the m-TiO2 layer, which protects the perovskite absorber from UV light by converting them more efficiently into visible light. To confirm such an interesting result, we developed a perovskite layer over the ETLs based on 0, 5, 10 and 15-DCP and subjected them to 365 nm UV irradiation under ambient conditions (Fig. S9† shows the photograph of perovskite films under UV irradiation), followed by an examination of their absorption behaviour often through the absorption spectra of each film. Fig. 13(a) and (b) show the absorption spectra of perovskite film, respectively, over 0-DCP and 15-DCP for intervals of 6, 12, 18, 24 and 48 h under UV irradiation.
 Fig. 13  UV stability of perovskite film over (a) 0-DCP and (b) 15-DCP. Inset: digital images of the perovskite film, which were subject to a UV stability test. 
From Fig. 13(a), it is clear that the perovskite layer over 0-DCP is significantly affected by UV radiation. Because the perovskite crystal structure is more sensitive to UV light, the layer over 0-DCP shows a sudden decrease (after 6 h) in its absorption spectrum. However, in the case of the perovskite film over 15-DCP (Fig. 13(b)), an apparent but diminutive decrease in the UV region of the absorption spectrum was observed after 6 h. Moreover, the respective films showed higher stability even after 24 h of UV irradiation, whereas the perovskite film over 0-DCP almost lost its absorption ability after 18 h of UV irradiation. The perovskite film over 15-DCP shows a slight decrease in its overall absorption after 48 h. Moreover, the perovskite film over 0-DCP shows its degradation apparently after 12 h. Furthermore, a small degradation spot at the corner of the perovskite film over 15-DCP is spotted after 48 h. The digital images of the perovskite films over 0-DCP and 15-DCP, which were subjected to UV stability, are shown in the inset of the respective absorption spectra (Fig. 13), where the importance of DC phosphors is achieved. From the entire stability analysis, it is understood that the inclusion of RbCaF3:Eu3+ in the ETL considerably reduces the degradation of the perovskite layer due to UV light, even though environmental influences, such as humidity and oxygen, slightly affect only the device stability.
4 Conclusion
In this study, we synthesized novel cubic-structured fluoroperovskite-based phosphors and utilized it as a DC luminescence material. Without changing the n-i-p configuration of HTM-free C-PSC, we included the synthesized RbCaF3:Eu3+ into the m-TiO2 layer of the PSC to utilize the high-energy UV region of the solar spectrum by converting them into low-energy visible emission. Though the DC-based PSC with a high content of DC phosphors (15-DCP) outperformed the other devices in terms of stability, the device based on 10-DCP exhibits significant improvement in the photocurrent density from 21.56 mA cm−2 to 23.54 mA cm−2 (9.2% improvement). Such improvement in Jsc leads to an elevated PCE of 13.3% for the equivalent device. The enhancement of Jsc is mainly due to extended excitation in the UV region. Additionally, the 5D0 → 7F1 transition state, resulting in intense emission at 590 nm, is absorbed by the perovskite layer more effectively than the typical Eu3+ emission at 614 nm. Moreover, DC phosphors support light scattering and enhancement in crystallinity as well as the grain size of the perovskite layer. Briefly, the three bottlenecks for the commercialization of PSC, i.e. the need for expensive metal electrodes, poor stability and lower current density as well as PCE of PSC, are addressed with a facile synthesized Eu3+-activated RbCaF3 by tailoring its emission and their application in the economical HTM free C-PSCs. We believe that these findings will provide new hope to the PV research community.
