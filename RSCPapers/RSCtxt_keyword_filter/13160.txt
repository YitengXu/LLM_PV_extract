    , Accepted 26th March 2018First published on 29th March 2018AbstractThanks to their high stability, good optoelectronic and extraordinary electrochromic properties, tungsten oxides are among the most valuable yet underexploited materials for energy conversion applications. Herein, colloidal one-dimensional carved nanocrystals of reduced tungsten trioxide (WO3−x) are successfully integrated, for the first time, as a hole-transporting layer (HTL) into CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells with a planar inverted device architecture. Importantly, the use of such preformed nanocrystals guarantees the facile solution-cast-only deposition of a homogeneous WO3−x thin film at room temperature, allowing achievement of the highest power conversion efficiency ever reported for perovskite solar cells incorporating raw and un-doped tungsten oxide based HTL.
Introduction
In the search for high-efficiency and environmentally sustainable energy sources, the recent breakthroughs in organic–inorganic perovskite-based solar cells have drawn the attention of the photovoltaic community.1–3 Hybrid halide perovskites outperform conventional solution processable materials in various solar cell layouts, spanning from the dye-sensitized mesoporous-type to planar and bulk-heterojunction-type device geometries.4–6 Disparate fullerene derivatives, polymers, small molecules and metal oxides, either available commercially or synthesized on purpose, have been tested as hole- (HTL) or electron-transporting layers (ETL) in hybrid perovskite solar cells with the aim of combining ease of processing and high efficiency.7–11 In particular, transition-metal oxide semiconductors have been extensively studied as transporting layers because of their capability of efficiently conducting photo-generated carriers and achieving charge injection for nearly any type of electrode.12,13 Among these, the interest in the broad family of tungsten oxides (henceforth broadly referred to as WOx), which includes stoichiometric (WO3) or sub-stoichiometric (WO3−x) compounds, for photovoltaic applications, derives from their extraordinary electrochromic properties,14 based on which their successful integration as a charge-transporting layer in solar cells could open a path for the development of innovative multifunction photovoltachromic devices suitable for building integration.15–19 To date, a few attempts have been made to integrate tungsten oxides into perovskite solar cells. The PCE of solar cells employing both thermally evaporated20 and solution-processed21 amorphous WOx as either HTL or ETL, respectively, could not overcome ∼9%. To raise the performance, several elaborate strategies have been developed. In an alternative solar cell architecture, a mixed amorphous WOx–TiOx nanocomposite was utilized as the basis to construct an electron-selective layer, in which the TiOx component was crucial not only to enhance light transmittance, charge transport and dissociation, but also to guarantee the concomitant suppression of charge recombination, thereby affording devices with a record PCE of ∼14.5%.22 On the same lines, a recent, elegant approach exploited solution-grown mixed WO3/TiO2 core/shell hetero-nanostructures based on either 1D nanorods or 2D nanosheets.23 The elongated shape of the 1D nanorods facilitated electron transport and the infiltration of the perovskite absorber, when compared with spherical nanoparticles. In addition, the 2D WO3 nanosheets were proven to further enhance the absorber infiltration, as compared with 1D nanostructures, resulting in the best performing perovskite/WO3 devices with a PCE of ∼11.2%. The electron transport of bare amorphous WOx was improved upon doping with Nb, which allowed obtaining a PCE of ∼13–15%, depending on the temperature at which the ETL was processed.24 In one of the cases reported, the PCE was dramatically improved to a level of ∼10% to ∼15% only upon modifying the perovskite/tungsten oxide interface with a cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3)/phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) interlayer,25 or with a C60 interlayer (with WOx annealed at 150 °C),26 respectively. Overall, the use of tungsten oxide has not allowed meeting the expected enhancement in PCE due to the modest structural quality of the interface formed between the amorphous WOx layer and the perovskite active layer.13,20–22 Wang et al. in fact demonstrated with the electrochemical characterization that WOx exhibits a low open-circuit voltage, mainly caused by interface related charge recombination.21
It is worth underlining that in all studies reported to date, WOx has been integrated into perovskite solar cells via a post-deposition annealing step, but the use of the room temperature-processed WOx as HTL in perovskite solar cells has never been demonstrated. Inspired from the previous findings summarized above, here we have engineered novel nanostructured WO3−x interlayers, acting as HTL in CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) perovskite solar cells, by exploitation of a recently developed prototype of colloidal nanocrystals as building blocks, namely, WO3−x carved nanorods (CNRs).19 The architecture of these solution-processable nanocrystals offers intriguing structural motifs that can be expected to greatly affect their fundamental charge-transport capabilities to an extent that may not be merely traced to their surface-to-volume ratio, when compared, for example, to their all-solid-filled nanorod counterparts.19 Indeed, the CNRs advantageously combine some features of 1D and 2D curved nanostructures: (i) an anisotropically extended crystal habit, which may underlie efficient, directional charge transport; (ii) a channel-like space structure, delimited by thin sidewalls and enclosed by a majority of concave and convex surfaces, which can be expected to improve the degree of intimate mixing at the interface between the perovskite and WO3−x components on the nanoscale. By tuning the surface properties of CNR films through gentle post-deposition processing routes, which were based on mild acetic-acid treatment in combination with UV-light irradiation, we were able to raise the photovoltaic device performance of WO3−x/MAPbI3 solar cells up to ∼13.3%. This efficiency value is the highest ever reported for perovskite devices incorporating an unmodified crystalline WO3−x as the interlayer, processed at room temperature.
Results and discussion
Solution-grown colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals with a precise composition, size and shape27–30 can be easily processed for device-fabrication purposes at room-temperature, in a way that their inherent properties may be retained.31–33 For the purposes of the present study, organic-soluble monocrystalline WO3−x carved nanorods (CNRs) have been exploited as building blocks to assemble the corresponding WO3−x interlayers to be integrated into perovskite solar cells. The CNRs were synthesized by a recently developed surfactant-assisted non-hydrolytic route, which relies on the high-temperature reaction of tungsten hexachloride, oleyl amine and oleic acid (see Experimental section for details).19 The representative scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image (Fig. 1a) of CNRs utilized in this work shows that the nanocrystals possessed all-longitudinally grooved (hence, concave) rod-like bodies with a mean length of ∼50 nm, an overall transverse cross-sectional diameter of ∼5–7 nm and ∼2 nm thick sidewalls. In the corresponding transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Fig. 1b), the rectangular-shaped projections of the CNRs revealed stripy amplitude-contrast profiles, which reflected the expected changes in electron-diffraction conditions across the channel-like bodies of CNRs randomly oriented on the substrate.19 The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the CNR powders (Fig. 1c) suggests that the nanocrystals possessed a crystal structure close to that of the monoclinic W18O49 reference phase (space group P2/m; ICSD code #15254). In general, due to being a high work function metal oxide, W18O49 is suitable as the hole-injecting buffer layers for the anode.12 The higher and sharper (010) and (020) reflections, compared to those expected for the bulk reference, indicated that the CNRs had preferentially grown in the [010] direction, which indeed is coincided with the major (longitudinal) elongation axis of the CNRs, as proved by previous structural studies on individual nanocrystals.19 These CNRs naturally integrate structural features at the crossover between 1D and 2D nanostructures: a dominantly linear-extended lattice with well-defined crystallographic orientation, forged into an ultrathin open-shell habit that offers easily accessible curved surfaces and a large nanoscale concave region.

The as-synthesized WO3−x CNRs, which were grown in hot mixtures of long-chain surfactants (i.e., oleyl amine and oleic acid), were ultimately capped with a hydrophobic organic shell that ensured their solubility in nonpolar organic solvents and guaranteed ease of processing into smooth, dense and homogeneous WO3−x layers by conventional spin-coating (Fig. 2a and Fig. S1a, ESI†). We constructed conductive WO3−x CNRs-based films on indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) transparent electrodes by an assembly strategy that involved multiple cycles of sequential nanocrystal-deposition and surface-treatment steps. Such post-deposition treatments are essential to remove the native insulating shell, with the purpose of improving charge transport and inter-nanocrystal electronic coupling across the functional nanocrystal-based films that are intended to be integrated into solar-cell devices.34–36 In each step, the freshly deposited WO3−x CNRs-based film, spin-coated from a chloroform solution, was washed with a dilute solution of acetic acid (AcOH) in methanol to promote stripping of the surface-adhering organic molecules.37 The films were also exposed to UV light at room temperature in air to stimulate, upon band-gap photoexcitation of WO3−x, photocatalytic pathways that could lead to the degradation of the surface organics, partial surface hydroxylation and/or oxidation of the CNRs.38–41 Removal of the surface ligands made the just-deposited CNRs insoluble, thus hard to be leached out into chloroform if spin-coating had to be reiterated to increase film thickness. Thus, our technique allowed two important objectives, relevant to the fabrication of high-quality WO3−x thin-film, to be simultaneously met: first, the film conductivity could be increased because of the enhanced inter-NC coupling, which would otherwise stay severely hindered by the original insulating surface ligands; second, the thickness of the WO3−x film could be systematically adjusted by simply controlling the number of deposition steps. Ultimately, the sequential spin-coating and AcOH/UV-irradiation treatments led to uniform multi-layer WO3−x films with a crack-free structure (scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization, Fig. S1 in the ESI†) and the desired thickness, which are critically important prerequisites to prevent the formation of leakage paths to the ITO underneath.31,42 For comparison purposes, the reference samples were WO3−x films that had been subjected either to AcOH washing or to UV irradiation only, respectively. In the atomic force microscopy (AFM) topographic images the corresponding sample (reported in Fig. 2a and d) grains for the pristine WO3−x film (Fig. 2a) appeared to be larger and less defined if compared to the treated ones (Fig. 2b and d). This could be due to the presence of the bulky surfactants anchored on the CNR surface, which exposed their long alkyl chains outwards. We verified the improved conductivity of the treated WO3−x films by measuring the sheet resistivity of the WO3−x CNR layer before and after the different post-deposition treatments. The pristine WO3−x behaved as an insulator, consistent with the presence of native insulting organic molecules on the film surface, which hindered the carrier transport. As expected, the AcOH washing, UV irradiation, and combined AcOH/UV treatment all reduced the sheet resistance of the WO3−x CNR film, down to ∼2.7 × 108 Ω sq−1, ∼9.4 × 107 Ω sq−1, and ∼5.1 × 107 Ω sq−1, respectively. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra of the pristine WO3−x film and those of the corresponding AcOH-, UV- and AcOH/UV-treated WO3−x films were examined (Fig. 2e). The spectrum of pristine WO3−x (Fig. 2e, black curve) revealed some characteristic bands attributable to weakly surface-adsorbed oleyl amide, the elimination byproducts derived from the high-temperature aminolysis reaction of tungsten carboxylate complexes formed in situ during the synthesis.43,44 These signals include the weak N–H stretching at ∼3310 cm−1 and the nonequivalent CO stretching vibrations at ∼1635 and ∼1550 cm−1 of dioleamide tautomers; the intense asymmetric and symmetric C–H stretching vibrations of the CH2/CH3 moieties of the alkyl chains at 2920–2855 cm−1, and the sharp CH2 bending signal at 1463 cm−1.45 The spectrum of the AcOH-treated WO3−x film (Fig. 2e, orange curve) showed suppression of the aliphatic C–H stretching and CO stretching vibrations,46 which indicated almost complete removal of the surface-adsorbed dioleamide coating47,48 (the residual C–H stretching signal could be due to contamination by AcOH that remained adsorbed after the washing treatment). The pristine and UV-treated samples (black and purple curves in Fig. 2e) exhibited nearly identical peaks. Accordingly, exposure of the AcOH-washed sample to UV irradiation (Fig. 2e, blue curve) did not result in substantial modification of its spectral features (cf.Fig. 2e, orange curve). Notwithstanding, we found that the wettability of the WO3−x films was modified by the diverse post-deposition treatments (inset in Fig. 2f). Both AcOH washing and UV irradiation resulted in a reduction of the contact angle of water, indeed. The combined effect of AcOH and UV led to a further enhancement of the wettability, reaching a contact angle of ∼38.6%. These observations suggested that UV treatment mainly led to a modification of the top surface of the film, eventually inducing enhanced hydrophilicity and reduced surface resistivity, but no degradation of the surface-adhering organic molecules (dioleamide) could be recognized within the detection limits of the FT-IR analyses. The latter evidence appears to be consistent with the lower photocatalytic activity of WO3−x,39,41 if compared to other oxide materials, such as TiO2 which can lead to a massive degradation of the capping molecules under UV irradiation.31,49 Considering that the results of the contact-angle measurements and that the 4-point technique provides a measure of in-plane conductivity, we speculate that the UV treatment could have exerted a mild photocatalytic action, resulting in partial removal of the surface organic molecules (yet to an extent undetectable by FT-IR),41,50,51 along with partial hydroxylation or oxidation of the native WO3−x CNRs.38,40 These mechanisms are believed to be, therefore, at the origin of the increased hydrophilicity.52 Importantly, according to the literature, the filling of oxygen vacancies would increase the hole concentration, thereby improving the p-type conductivity of the materials.53,54 Moreover, it has been demonstrated that UV irradiation can enhance inter-particle connection in TiO2- and SnO2-based materials, which could be beneficial for photovoltaic applications.55,56 Notably, we found that our developed surface treatments on WO3−x were essential to achieve the deposition of a uniform perovskite layer suitable for photovoltaic device integration. We ascertained, indeed, that the scarce wettability of the pristine untreated WO3−x film (due to its hydrophobic organic capping) by the perovskite precursor solution hindered the deposition of perovskite layers thereon and, consequently, the fabrication of a working device. Conversely, the deposition of perovskite on AcOH-, UV- and UV-treated WO3−x resulted, in all cases, in pinhole- and crack-free films, thus suitable for device integration. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the perovskite layer deposited on the AcOH-, UV- and UV-treated WO3−x films are reported in Fig. 3a–c. The perovskite films deposited on AcOH-washed WO3−x, which had undergone no UV treatment (Fig. 3a) or either UV irradiation (Fig. 3c), featured larger morphological structures that are, in general, associated with reduced bulk defects and improved charge carrier mobility,57 when compared to the smaller structures’ grains, detected in perovskite films deposited on WO3−x only UV irradiated (Fig. 3b). This difference could be attributed to the interaction of perovskite precursors with the residual surface organic contaminants or AcOH. With the purpose of evaluating the as-prepared WO3−x buffer layers in perovskite solar cells, we fabricated devices consisting of a simple sandwich-like inverted geometry: ITO/WO3−x CNRs/MAPbI3/PCBM/LiF-Al, where the holes and electrons are extracted through the WO3−x layer at the ITO and through the PCBM at the LiF–Al contacts, respectively. In Fig. 3e, we report a sketch of the device structure and the results of the comparative evaluation of the impact of the WO3−x interlayer that had undergone different treatments, on the photovoltaic performance. The positive effect of the combined UV/AcOH treatment on WO3−x can be readily observed, resulting in devices that outperformed those involving both the UV and AcOH treatment only. The champion device, based on the AcOH/UV-treated WO3−x HTM, exhibited a FF = 74, VOC = 0.87 V, a current density of 20.7 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 13.3% with negligible hysteresis (Fig. S2a, ESI†) that is the highest ever reported for perovskite devices with unmodified WO3−x HTL deposited at room temperature.20 For this case, Fig. 3g displays the relevant J–V curve and the current density at the maximum power point. The results of the screening of the performances of solar cells incorporating either UV-, AcOH- or AcOH/UV-treated WO3−x interlayers, respectively, are reported in the ESI† (Fig. S2b). The SEM image of the cross-section of the active material in the device (Fig. 3e) demonstrated the formation of a compact and sharply defined WO3−x/perovskite bi-layer film, which favored the establishment of good electric contact at the interfaces with the anode. The dependence of the performances of solar cells, based on AcOH/UV-treated WO3−x, on interlayer thickness is reported in the ESI† (Fig. S3). We observed that the thicknesses exceeding two layers (∼40 nm) of WO3−x resulted in a reduction of PCE, caused by a net decrease of FF and JSC. This fact suggested that in such thick films, the paths for charge-recombination losses in WO3−x became substantial. When the WO3−x film was too thin, as for the single layer, the efficiency of solar cell dropped as well, possibly due to the inhomogeneous coverage of the anode, as suggested by the lower VOC. In order to deepen our comprehension of the capability of tungsten oxide CNR films to efficiently extract the charge from the perovskite layer, we performed steady-state and time-resolved optical emission measurements at visible frequencies (Fig. S4, ESI†).

The bare perovskite layer deposited on glass and protected from moisture by the poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) inert polymer,58 showed very long photoluminescence (PL) decays, indicating low electronic trap densities and balanced carrier transport.59,60 By comparison, the decays associated with the same emission were faster when the perovskite active layer was coupled to the WO3−x substrate, yet with no appreciable differences among the behaviors of the differently treated samples (the parameters of the radiative decay fits are reported in Table S1 in the ESI†). This fact suggested the occurrence of an efficient hole-extraction process.61 Noticeably, in the investigated systems, only the WO3−x/perovskite interface was active; for this reason, the quenching of the perovskite emission was not complete.62 This observation suggests that the nanostructured surface of the WO3−x films, consisting of assembled CNRs, promoted an intermixing with the perovskite active layer, which allowed an efficient charge injection into the oxide. Very interestingly, we did not find differences in PL decay time among the devices incorporating WO3−x that had been subjected to different treatments; therefore, the different photovoltaic performances of the devices should be traced to mechanisms other than the hole-transfer. Post-deposition surface treatments, which could influence the density and distribution of surface defects, are known to affect the electrical properties of transition-metal oxides in general.30 Surface defects, which are most commonly believed to be oxygen vacancies63 and/or terminal hydroxyls groups, can also affect surface states and the Fermi level.64,65 In transition-metal oxides, in particular, even small amounts of surface adsorbates can significantly alter the work function (WF),66 in particular, the unavoidable contamination of the surrounding gas molecules lowers the WF (on the absolute scale).67 For these reasons, a large spread of WF values have been reported for WOx materials, which originates from the diversity of deposition techniques and post-deposition treatments (air exposure, sintering, high-vacuum, microwave) that have been applied to meet different purposes.54,67–69 Therefore, we expected that the different surface treatments applied to WO3−x CNR films might have significant repercussions on the material's WF.63 With the purpose of analyzing the substrate surfaces, shifts in the oxide WFs were evaluated by means of a macroscopic Kelvin probe (KP), a very sensitive non-invasive technique that utilizes a parallel plate capacitor with a vibrating plate (tip) to measure the surface potential i.e., the contact potential difference between the tip and sample surface. Using a gold tip as reference, the observed measured shift of surface potential can be related to a shift of the WF.70 We studied the surface potential variation across the differently treated WO3−x films deposited on ITO, as portrayed in Fig. 4, where the values measured on ITO and aluminum films are also reported as references. In agreement with the similar WF values reported in the literature,71 the ITO showed a minimal deviation of ∼60 meV from the gold tip surface potential. A significant mismatch was revealed between the WO3−x samples treated with AcOH and UV. The surface potential of the AcOH-treated WO3−x was shifted by ∼180 mV towards positive values with respect to the gold tip, whereas the UV-exposed sample features a significant deviation of ∼700 mV towards negative values. This negative shift is in accordance with the picture of the partial hydroxylation of the WO3−x surface upon UV irradiation.72 Accordingly, the AcOH-washed sample that had also been exposed to UV light featured an intermediate situation, exhibiting a negative surface potential shift of about ∼210 mV from the gold tip. Overall, the KP data thus evidenced that the UV irradiation treatment caused a negative surface potential shift, which could be correlated with a lowering of the WF in the samples. This exceedingly large shift of the UV-irradiated WO3−x surface potential towards negative values, regardless of its higher conductivity, could hinder the hole-injection to the ITO anode lowering the efficiency of the corresponding photovoltaic devices.73 In parallel, the AcOH–WO3−x, although having a suitable low shift towards positive values if compared to ITO, had the lowest planar conductivity that possibly caused a drop in the photovoltaic performance. Overall, the cooperative action of surfactant removal by AcOH and UV irradiation gave the best compromise results in term of conductivity, surface potential shift and photovoltaic device efficiency. The AcOH washing only seemed to be insufficient to raise solar cell performance. Consequently the UV irradiation, by exerting a mild photocatalytic action and inducing partial hydroxylation/oxidation of the native WO3−x CNRs, as suggested by previous studies, could increase the hole concentration improving its p-type conductivity53,54 and enhance inter-particle connection.55,56

Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully engineered novel nanostructured HTL based on preformed colloidal WO3−x CNRs, obtaining the highest PCE for raw and un-doped tungsten oxide based HTL in perovskite solar cells. An in-depth experimental analysis suggested that a combined AcOH/UV WO3−x surface treatment, if compared to UV irradiation or AcOH washing only, resulted in the best performing devices. Overall, the good charge-transfer/conduction properties, ligand removal procedure and interfacial modification all contributed to the achievements of the highest PCE for AcOH/UV WO3−x HTL processed at room temperature. Our approach is simple and straightforward and offers an effective path towards the integration of WOx as an interlayer in perovskite solar cells, which can be potentially extended to more elaborate multifunctional device architectures.
Experimental section
Synthesis of WO3−x carved nanorods (CNRs)
All syntheses were carried out under an inert atmosphere in 50 mL three-neck flasks connected to a standard Schlenk line set-up, according to a recently developed protocol, with minor modifications.19 In a typical preparation of WO3−x CNRs with an aspect ratio of ∼8, 0.3 mmol of WCl6 (99.9%, Aldrich), 9.5 mmol of ODE (90%, Aldrich), 4.5 mmol of OLAM (70%, Aldrich) and 4.5 mmol of OLAC (90%, Aldrich) were degassed together at ∼120 °C for 1 h under vigorous stirring. The mixture was then slowly heated up to 310 °C under N2 flow and kept at this temperature for 2 h. Finally, the heating source was removed and the system was allowed to naturally cool down. After the synthesis, the nanocrystals were induced to flocculate out of the crude reaction mixture upon addition of acetone, then recovered by centrifugation, and finally washed twice with acetone. The as-extracted and purified hydrophobic-capped CNRs were easily re-dissolved in anhydrous chloroform and stored under N2 in a glove box prior to further use.
Device preparation
Patterned ITO-coated glass substrates (Visiontech) were cleaned by ultrasonication in deionized water, 2 propanol and acetone. The substrates were treated according to the following washing procedure: they were immersed into a 5:1:1 v/v mixture of double distilled Milli-Q water, hydrogen-peroxide (H2O2) and ammonia (NH3) at 80 °C for 10 min to remove organic contamination, then rinsed 10 times with water prior to the next deposition steps. The WO3−x CNR coatings were fabricated under ambient laboratory conditions as follows. A solution of purified WO3−x CNRs in CHCl3 was spin-coated onto patterned ITO cleaned substrates at 2500 rpm for 30 s to form a WO3−x thin layer of ∼20 nm. A solution of acetic acid (AcOH) in methanol (4 M) was dispensed on top of the film and then spin-cast. The WO3−x coatings were irradiated with a continuous-wave ultraviolet (cw-UV) lamp (Bromograph Nuova Delta Elettronica mod. MF1030 Lamps Silvenia BL350 with excitation wavelength centered at 320–380 nm) positioned at a distance of 10 cm from the sample. This procedure was repeated until the desired film thickness (∼40 nm) was reached (∼two layers).
CH3NH3I (MAI) was synthesized according to a literature procedure.74 CH3NH2 (27.86 mL, 40% in methanol, TCI) and hydroiodic acid (30 mL, 57 wt% in water, Aldrich) were mixed at 0 °C and stirred for 2 h. The precipitate was recovered after solvent evaporation at 50 °C for 1 h. The product was washed with diethyl ether three times and finally dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h.
To prepare the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite precursor solution (43 wt%), the as-synthesized MAI and commercial PbI2 (ultra-dry, 99.999%, Alfa Aesar) were dissolved in a mixture of dimethylformammide (DMF, ≥99%; Sigma-Aldrich) and DMSO (DMSO, 99.8%; Sigma-Aldrich) at a DMF:DMSO:PbI2 8.2:1:1 w/w, then stirred at ambient temperature for 1 h.75 The CH3NH3PbI3 solution was spin-coated onto the WO3−x-coated ITO substrate by a single step procedure at a rate of 4000 rpm. for 25 s. Solvent dripping was made with a 250 μL of toluene 14 s before the end of the spin-coating process. Eventually, the perovskite film was thermally annealed for 10 min at 100 °C. After cooling to room temperature, a PC60BM (99.8%, Sigma Aldrich) solution (25 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) was spin-coated on the perovskite layer at 1000 rpm for 60 s. The device cathode, consisting of a 0.5 nm-thick LiF layer and a 150 nm-thick Al layer, was thermally evaporated atop the device at a pressure of 5 × 10−6 mbar.
X-ray diffraction (XRD)
XRD patterns were recorded with a D8-Discover Bruker diffractometer (3.3 kW) equipped with a Cu source (operated at 40/40 mA/kV), a Goebel mirror, an Eurelian cradle goniometer, and a scintillator detector. The samples for measurements were prepared by depositing CNRs from a concentrated colloidal solution onto silicon substrates, and then allowing the solvent to evaporate. XRD patterns were collected, in 2θ scan mode with a fixed incident angle of 5°, moving the detector over the 2θ range 10°–120° with a step size of 0.05°.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
Conventional TEM investigation was performed on the as-synthesized WO3−x CNRs with a JEOL JEM 1400Plus microscope, equipped with a GATAN Orius SC600 CCD camera and a W filament-source operating at 120 kV. The samples for TEM analysis were prepared by drop-casting a few drops of suitably dilute CNR solutions onto standard carbon-coated copper TEM grids in a N2-protected glove-box and allowing the solvent to evaporate. The as-prepared sample grids were then transferred into the TEM microscope.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM)
AFM characterization was obtained with a park scanning probe microscope (PSIA) operating in air and in a noncontact mode to reduce tip induced surface degradation. The image acquisition was performed in air at room temperature.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
SEM images of the samples were recorded with a Carl Zeiss Auriga40 Crossbeam instrument, equipped with a Gemini column and an integrated high efficiency In-lens detector, working at an applied acceleration voltage of 5 kV and a short acquisition time to avoid beam-damage of the samples, in high vacuum and high-resolution acquisition mode.
UV-vis absorption
UV-vis absorption spectra of the WO3−x films were recorded using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 1050 spectrophotometer at room temperature.
Contact angle measurements
Static water contact angles were measured using the sessile drop method and a CAM 200 (KSV Instruments Ltd Finland) instrument. Solvent contact angles were measured on WO3−x samples treated in the same way as the WO3−x films destined for devices. The presented results correspond to an average of measurements performed onto many areas of three samples.
Solar cell characterization
The devices were characterized using a Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit and a calibrated Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5G) solar simulator (Newport 91160A) with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The solar simulator irradiance was set to 100 mW cm−2 using a thermopile radiant power meter with a fused-silica window (Spectra Physics Oriel, model 70260). The active area of the complete device was 0.04 cm−2. All devices are tested using 100 mV s−1 or 1000 mV s−1 scan rates, under a nitrogen atmosphere at 22 °C. A calibrated filtered Si diode (Newport, 91150V) served as the reference cell for J–V measurements.
Transient PL measurements
Steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence were measured by an Edinburgh FLS920 spectrometer equipped with a Peltier-cooled Hamamatsu R928 photomultiplier tube (185–850 nm). An Edinburgh Xe900 450 W Xenon arc lamp was used as the exciting light source. Corrected spectra were obtained via a calibration curve supplied with the instrument. Emission lifetimes were determined with the single photon counting technique by means of the same Edinburgh FLS980 spectrometer using a laser diode as the excitation source (1 MHz, λexc = 635 nm, 57 ps pulse width and about 30 ps time resolution after deconvolution with an excitation power of 0.52 mW cm−2) and a Hamamatsu MCP R3809U-50 (time resolution 20 ps) as detector. Perovskite thin films sealed with a 50 nm-thick poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) layer were excited at 635 nm with a 250 W Tungsten continuous-wave light source, resulting in an effective excitation power of 1.6 mW cm−2.
Kelvin probe (KP) measurements
Macroscopic KP measurements were performed under ambient conditions using a 2 mm diameter gold tip amplifier (Ambient Kelvin Probe Package from KP Technology Ltd). The KP technique provided a voltage resolution of about 5 mV on a sampled surface area of about 3 mm2. A comprehensive description of the technique can be found elsewhere.54,69
Four-points probe measurements
The sheet resistance of WO3−x films on glass was performed in air and at RT conditions using an Ecopia 3100 system in the van der Paw configuration where gold tips were placed on the four corners of squared samples.
