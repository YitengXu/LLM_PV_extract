PIC2 has been incorporated into block-copolymers with either regioregular poly(3-dodecylthiophene) (P3DT → P(3DT-b-IC2)) or regioregular polythiazole (PTzTHX → P(TzTHX-b-IC2)). Block copolymer batches with different block-sizes have been isolated and their properties have been studied. Fluorescence quenching in the solid state and transient absorption spectroscopy indicate energy transfer from the donor- to the acceptor block upon photo-excitation. Fabrication of proof-of-principle organic photovoltaic cells with P(3DT-b-IC2) gave cells with an open circuit voltage (VOC) of ca. 0.89 V. The aggregation behavior of P(3DT-b-IC2) from solution was also studied, which revealed self-assembly into discreet microspheres of 1–8 μm diameter, with a size distribution of 1.72 (±0.37) μm under optimized aggregation conditions.
Introduction
Key challenges in the fabrication of organic solar cells (OSCs) are the control over the phase separation of the electron donor- (p-type) and the electron acceptor-material (n-type) in the active layer, as well as the long-term stability of the active layer morphology.1 The self-organization of block copolymers (BCPs) has been proposed as an elegant way to reproducibly generate a stable bulk morphology,2 due to the inherent ability of BCPs to phase separate into distinct phases on a nanometer scale. The potentialities of this approach were demonstrated, for instance by Thelakkat,3 well as, by Russel and Emrick,4 who showed that the phase separation of a poly(3-hexylthiophene)-block-poly(perylene diimide acrylate) can indeed be efficiently controlled. The key to the preparation of this block copolymer was the synthesis of the poly(3-hexylthiophene)-block (P3HT) via quasi-living cross-coupling polycondensation, different methods of which – termed Catalyst-Transfer-Polycondensation, CTP – have attracted increasing interest in recent years.5 CTP has been used to generate chain-end functionalized conjugated polymers that can be converted into BCPs.2a–d,g,3,4 Likewise, all-conjugated BCPs can be prepared via sequential addition of bifunctional monomers under CTP-conditions.5 This approach has been extensive employed to prepare BCPs featuring different electron-rich building blocks, while few examples of all-conjugated donor–acceptor BCPs have been reported so far: Seferos and coworkers were able to add a poly(2H-benzotriazole) co-block to P3HT (A, Chart 1),6 while Koeckelberghs et al. reported the preparation of BCP B, featuring a poly(thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine) co-block.7,8

Notably, when polythiophenes (PTs) are prepared by Kumada-coupling CTP, the reactive nickel-catalyst, that remains coordinated to the polymer chain-end, is also capable of polymerizing isocyanides and thereby allows to add a polyisocyanide (PIC9) co-block.10 This discovery has led to an increased interest in polyarene and PIC-containing BCPs,11,12 including the donor–acceptor BCP C (Chart 1), equipped with perylene diimide acceptor-groups.13
Until recently, OSCs based donor–acceptor-BCPs showed comparatively poor performance.2a However, significant progress in the last two years yielded power conversion efficiencies (PCE) exceeding 6%,14 albeit with an active material that had been synthesized by coupling separately prepared alternating copolymers. In contrast, strategies for the preparation of new and structurally diverse BCPs by elegant sequential copolymerization remains challenging. In this work, we report significant progress towards this end, by introducing the first examples of all-conjugated donor–acceptor BCPs featuring a new type of PIC co-block as acceptor component.
In the recent past, we showed that regioregular polythiazoles (rr-PTzs) can be prepared by CTP,15–17 and developed a new class of electroactive PICs equipped with conjugated fulvenyl-groups (Chart 1, PIC1–PIC3).18 In this paper we report the charge transport characteristics of PIC1, PIC2, and PIC3, and the synthesis, and properties of donor–acceptor BCPs (P(3DT-b-IC2) and P(TzTHX-b-IC2)) featuring PIC2 as acceptor-co-block.
Results and discussion
Semiconducting properties of fulvenyl-functionalized PICs
We investigated the charge transport abilities of the previously reported polymers PIC1, PIC2 and PIC3,18 in order to evaluate their potential use in organic electronic applications (see section 5.2 of the ESI†). To this end, a series of single carrier electron-only and hole-only devices was prepared, and the charge carrier mobilities were extracted by analyzing the current–voltage characteristics according to Space Charge Limited Current (SCLC) theory. These measurements yielded electron- (μe) and hole-mobilities (μh) in the suitable range for device fabrication of 10−4 to 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for all compounds. PIC2 proved a surprising exception, however, as it showed a high electron transporting capability of μe = (1.04 ± 2.5) × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, this value is the highest electron mobility yet observed under SCLC conditions. Under comparable experimental conditions, electron mobilities above 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 have been reported for high performance n-type acceptor polymers.1,19 However, higher SCLC mobilities in the range of 10−2 to 10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1 have only been reported for hole conducting (p-type) semiconducting polymers.20 The origin of the high electron mobility in PIC2 could not be ascertained at this point. PIC2 does not melt prior to decomposition, and is amorphous, according to X-ray analyses.‡ Also, since all three PICs are exclusively composed of conjugated π-systems, this lack of insulating alkyl-sidechains should be beneficial for charge transport in all cases. What makes PIC2 unique, however, is the three-dimensional structure of the tetraphenylcyclopentadienyl-moiety.18,21 Combined with the non-planar structure of the polyisocyanide backbone,9 this may allow interdigitation of phenyl-rings of neighbouring polymer chains in three dimensions, and may thereby improve electronic coupling and charge hopping between chains.

PIC2 undergoes reversible electrochemical reduction with a low LUMO-level of −3.60 eV,18 and has a large optical gap (λonset = 560 nm, Eoptg = 2.27 nm), which indicates a HOMO-level of ca. −5.85 eV. This combination should make PIC2 suitable for use as n-type acceptor co-block in combination with PTs and other electron rich donors. We therefore further explored the potentialities of PIC2 by preparing the corresponding BCPs with poly(3-dodecylthiophene) (P3DT → P(3DT-b-IC2) and poly(4-((trihexylsilyloxy)-methylene)-thiazole) (PTzTHX17 → P(TzTHX-b-IC2).
PIC2-containing block-copolymers
In a one-pot reaction, macroinitiators (MI1, MI2) bearing ortho-anisyl- and Ni(II)-end-groups were prepared from 2-bromo-3-dodecyl-5-iodo-thiophene (1)22 and 5-bromo-2-chloro-4-((trihexylsilyloxy)-methylene)-thiazole (2),15via Kumada-coupling CTP using 2% Ni(o-anisyl)(dppe)Br15 as pre-catalyst (Scheme 1, dppe = 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane). The polymerization was left to proceed for 20–30 minutes, and the isocyanide 3 was then added in different ratios (Table 1) to generate the PIC co-block. Subsequently, the BCPs were isolated by precipitation into methanol, and were purified by washing and extraction with different solvents.§

Analyses of the BCP batches by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) gave number-average molecular weights of Mn = 22.9 kg mol−1 at a polydispersity (PDI) of 1.06 for BP11, and Mn = 24.5 kg mol−1 (PDI = 1.03) and 21.4 kg mol−1 (PDI = 1.03) for BP21 and BP31, respectively (see Fig. S1a/b in the ESI†). Control-samples of the macroinitiators MI1 taken prior to addition of the isocyanide showed Mn values of 15.7 kg mol−1 (PDI = 1.05) for BP11, and 20.8 kg mol−1 (PDI = 1.02) for BP21 and BP31, which were prepared in a combined experiment.¶ For BP4 a similar increase of the molecular weight was achieved from Mn = 33.6 kg mol−1 (PDI = 1.13) for the macroinitiator MI2 to Mn = 38.4 kg mol−1 (PDI = 1.04) in BP4. The reaction was not quite as clean, however, and the crude polymer required additional purification by preparative GPC (Fig. S2 in the ESI†). The GPC data show a direct correlation of the BCP-composition to the feed ratio in BP11 through BP31 (Table 1), in so far as the lengths of the PIC-blocks decreases with the lowered thiophene (n) to isocyanide (m) ratio. However, GPC seemingly underestimates the incorporation of isocyanide 3. For instance, a thiophene:isocyanide feed ratio of 1:1 results in an n:m ration of 4:1 ratio in BP11, while for BP31 the GPC data correspond to addition of only one isocyanide monomer per polymer chain. We attribute this finding to the known overestimation of the MW of the rod-like PTs by GPC.23 In the present case, this is then compensated by addition of the bulkier isocyanides in the PIC2-co-block.|| This conjecture was corroborated by energy dispersive X-ray-spectroscopy (EDX), and end-group analyses via1H NMR, as well as thermal analyses: an estimate of the degree of polymerization by referencing the aryl- and alkyl-signals in 1H NMR spectra against the o-anisyl-groups introduced at the polymer chain end,15** (Table 1, see Fig. S3 through S5 in the ESI†) gave invariably lower MWs for the P3DT- and PTzTHX-blocks, and showed 4–8-times larger PIC-contents. Likewise, determination of the sulphur- and nitrogen-content of aggregated BCPs by EDX-analyses (Table 1, see also Table S2 in the ESI†) gave molar n/m ratios that are in good agreement with the values derived from 1H NMR data.
Thermal analyses: analysis by thermal gravimetry (TGA, Fig. S6 and Table S1 in the ESI†) shows that PIC2 degrades above 365 °C and leaves 43% residual mass at 800 °C. The homo polymers P3DT and PTzTHX decompose rapidly above 457 °C and 408 °C to leave just 17% and 14% of residual mass, respectively. Sequential decomposition of the individual blocks of the BPCs could not be directly observed. However, the residual masses of the BCPs at 800 °C directly correlate with the relative content of PIC2, for both types of BCPs. The homo- and block-copolymers were also analysed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, Fig. S7†). PIC2 decomposes without melting,18 while for P3DT melting (Tm = 165 °C) and crystallization (Tc = 135 °C) was observed in agreement with literature.24 Phase transitions of the P3DT-block were observed at increasingly lower temperatures for BP31 (Tm = 165 °C, Tc = 108 °C) and BP21 (Tm = 147 °C, Tc = 97 °C), while for BP11 no phase transitions were observed. The phase-transitions in the block-copolymer were unambiguously assigned to crystallization of the P3DT-block by subsequent analyses of the DSC samples of BP31 and of a P3DT-reference sample by small- and wide-angle powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). Both samples show a diffraction peaks at 2Θ = 3.56° that correspond to a distance of 24.7 Å, as expected for the lamellar spacing of the PT main chains in P3DT26 (see Fig. S15 in the ESI†). Weaker refraction peaks assigned to π–π-stacking are also present at 23.0° (3.95 Å).
Notably, according to these data, all BCPs have an appreciable PIC2-content, ranging from 23 mass% for BP31 to 70 mass% for BP11, all of which is π-conjugated material that can contribute to charge transport.
UV-vis absorption spectra of the BCP also allow to deduce their composition. PIC2 has a longest wavelength absorption maximum (λmax) in solution at 365 nm, while the λmax of P3DT is 445 nm. Consequently, the absorption maxima of BP11 through BP31 the increasingly shift to longer wave-length (Fig. 1A) with increasing content of P3DT. This assumption about the origin of the red-shift was corroborated by reproduction of the BCP absorption spectra through overlay of spectra of the respective homopolymers (see Fig. S13 in the ESI†). Film spectra also allowed to directly observe the P3DT-block (Fig. 1B). As-cast films of the BCPs show new red-shifted absorption bands compared to solution, that exhibit with weak vibronic structuring. The relative intensity of the newly emerging band scales with P3DT-content, and the vibronic structuring becomes more pronounced after annealing, indicating crystallization of the P3DT block.26 However, an investigation of the annealed films by Gracing Incidence X-ray Diffraction (GIXD), showed no refraction that would indicate the presence of separate crystalline phases. For BP4 the presence of the PIC2 block has a only a limited impact on the absorption spectra. Its main contribution is increased absorption of BP4 below 450 nm.

The BCPs remained fluorescent in solution and showed emission corresponding to the respective P3DT- and PTzTHX-blocks, while in all cases fluorescence was quantitatively quenched in thin films (see Fig. S8A/B in the ESI†). Since PIC2 is inherently non-fluorescent,18 and both PTs25 and PTzTHX17 exhibit fluorescence in the solid state. This indicates that intramolecular charge-transfer onto the acceptor block does not occur in solution, but may be present in films.
The bulk morphology of the active layer is one of the most important factors determining the performance of organic photovoltaic cells. However, since GIXD investigations of films did not indicate the occurrence of phase-separation, we investigated the potential self-assembly of the BCPs in solution. PIC2 is insoluble in n-alkanes, while PTzTHX and P3DT can be dissolved in these solvent at ambient to elevated temperatures. BP11 through BP4 were therefore each dissolved in hot n-heptane or n-hexane, and changes to the optical properties during slow cooling where continuously monitored by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy (Fig. 1D, Fig. 2, see Fig. S9–S12 in the ESI†). All BCPs initially appear molecularly dissolved, but begin to aggregate below 55–60 °C. For BP11 through BP31, the characteristic absorption bands of the PT-block emerge, accompanied by a weakening of the corresponding band of the molecularly dissolved polymer fraction between 300 and 500 nm. This process reveals isosbestic points (IPs) for all three PT-containing BCPs between 486 and 509 nm (BP11: λIP = 505 nm, BP21: λIP = 509 nm, and BP31: λIP = 486 nm). In the aggregation of neat P3DT an IP is also observed at 486 nm (Fig. S9 in the ESI†). The effect is attributed to serendipitous compensation of the higher absorption coefficient of the aggregated polymer against the lowering concentration of the solubilized polymer. The underlying absorption of the PIC2-block hardly changes between solution and solid state,18 but causes the shift of the IP longer wavelength with increasing PIC2-content. Furthermore, the relative intensity of the aggregation bands again directly scales with the relative P3DT-content, while the vibronic fine-structures are much more sharper than those observed in film spectra (Fig. 1B). This latter observation indicated the presence of structurally well-defined aggregates, and prompted us to analyze the aggregated BCPs in more detail. PXRD of aggregated precipitates revealed low overall crystallinity (see Fig. S13A/B in the ESI†). However, refraction peaks associated with the lamellar spacing of P3DT26 at 2Θ ≈ 3.75° (23.6 Å) indicate the presence of crystalline P3DT in aggregated BP11 and BP21.

Further analyses of the aggregates by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) showed BP11 and BP21 to form unspecific aggregates, without larger scale ordering (see section 4 of the ESI†). BP31, on the other hand, reproducibly self-assembled into microspheres with sizes ranging from 0.5 to 5 μm (Fig. 3E–G, and section 4 of the ESI†). An analysis of the size distribution showed the BCP-particles to have an average diameter of 5.33 μm with a broad standard deviation of σ = ±1.28 μm (Fig. 3H), along with a significant portion of unspecifically aggregated material similar to BP21. Slower cooling of a more dilute solution allowed better control over the particle formation, and resulted in microspheres with an average diameter of 1.72 μm (σ = ±0.37 μm) and a much narrower size distribution (Fig. 3A–D).
 Fig. 3  SEM-micrographs (A–C, E–G) and size histograms (D/H) of microspheres formed by self-assembling of BP31 under different conditions. 
Analogous aggregation experiments with BP4 also confirmed aggregation of the PTzTHX-block (Fig. 2, see also Fig. S10 through S12 in the ESI†17). Initially, absorption and fluorescence correspond to those of neat PTzTHX in solution, while lowering of the temperature yields spectra that correspond to PTzTHX in the solid state. Hence, these observations indicate that charge transfer from PTzTHX to the PIC2-block is not taking place in the polymer aggregates. Analyses of these aggregates by SEM did not show distinct aggregate formation.
Time-resolved fluorescence, transient absorption spectroscopy, and block-copolymer solar cells
Time resolved fluorescence measurements by time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC, see ESI† for details) on BCP films, showed faster fluorescence quenching in BP11, BP21 and BP31 than in neat P3DT. We interpret this as a clear evidence of electron transfer from P3DT to the PIC2-acceptor block (Fig. 4A). Curiously, fluorescence quenching was faster in BP21 and BP31, in spite of the lower acceptor content in these polymers. A reason for this observation may be a higher crystallinity of the P3DT-phase in these materials, which would also lead to more self-quenching than in BP11.

D: Kinetics of photo luminescence decay. E/F: Kinetics of exciton- and charge-generation derived by global analysis of transient absorption spectra with charge as reference. 
The fluorescence quenching results are confirmed by transient absorption experiments (Fig. 4D). Global analysis of transient absorption data for neat P3DT (Fig. 4B/E) showed the decay of excitons on a ∼50 ps timescale with a very small number of excitons being converted to geminate charge pairs, which also decays on the ∼ns timescale. BP11 (Fig. 4C/F) in contrast shows faster decay for excitons assisted with appearance of a polaron signal. This indicates efficient exciton dissociation to charges at ∼2 ps timescale. Photo-generated carriers in BP11 are much less prone to recombination in agreement with the observed photocurrent generation in photovoltaic devices. Overall, ultrafast experiments indicate very efficient early stages of photon-to-charge conversion in all the studied block-copolymer materials.
Tests of all three BCPs in single-component photovoltaic cells gave the best performance (see section 5.1 of the ESI† for details) for a device fabricated from BP21. BP21 showed a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.01% at an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.65 V, a short circuit current (ISC) of 66.2 μA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 30%. BP11 gave the highest VOC (0.89 V), but showed much lower overall performance (PCE = 0.005%) due to a lower ISC (24.4 μA cm−2) and a moderate FF (25%). BP31 showed an intermediate performance (PCE = 0.008%), due to a lower VOC (0.48 V), and a reasonably ISC (56.9 μA cm−2). Device performance generally improved upon thermal or solvent vapour annealing (see ESI† for details), which indicates that all devices benefit from crystallization of the P3DT-phase. The results highlight the importance of the relative donor- and acceptor content in the BCO, which appears to be best in BP21. Too low P3DT content in BP11 may hamper hole extraction and also phase separation, since PIC2 does not melt. While the lower content of PIC2 in BP31 does not provide percolation pathways for electron transport. The reason for the low performance seems to be inefficient donor–acceptor phase-separation in the active layer, which prevents charge extraction and favours recombination.
These results show that the combination of PIC2 with a PT is a viably strategy to generate functioning OSCs. However, given the known challenges in development of BCP-based organic solar cells, further optimization will be required to improve the performance of systems reported herein.
Conclusions
We have established fulvenyl-functionalized PICs, as a promising new class of semiconducting polymers. Particularly the electron mobility exhibited by the acceptor-polymer PIC2 (μe = 1.04 × 10−2 (±2.5) cm2 V−1 s−1) rivals that of known high performance polymeric n-type semiconductors. Furthermore, we have shown, that PIC2 can be readily incorporated into all-conjugated BCPs (P(3DT-b-IC2) and P(TzTHX-b-IC2)) with PT- and PTz co-blocks that are accessible via nickel catalyzed cross-coupling polycondensation. Fluorescence quenching in BCP-films, and transient absorption spectroscopy data indicate energy transfer from the donor- onto the acceptor-blocks upon photoexcitation. Preparation of proof-of-principle-devices also indicates that P(3DT-b-IC2) is a promising material for the fabrication of single-component block-copolymer solar cells. Investigation of the aggregation behaviour of P(3DT-b-IC2) showed that its self-organization can be controlled by varying the relative block-sizes, and aggregation conditions. These findings show that fulvenyl-functionalized PICs constitute a highly versatile class of new electroactive polymers that may be employed in various organic electronic applications.

Poly(thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine) is a low band gap polymer (Eoptg ≈ 1.0 eV) with high electron affinity (LUMO ≈ −4.1 eV), but also a very high HOMO-level (ca. −5.1 eV), which renders it unsuitable e.g. as acceptor material in OPV.
