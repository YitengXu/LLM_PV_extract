    , Accepted 15th January 2020First published on 5th August 2020AbstractConventional desalination technologies play a central role in alleviating the crisis of increasing freshwater shortages; however, they are impeded by high cost, intensive energy consumption and environmental pollution. Solar-driven interfacial evaporation (SDIE) for desalination has been recognized as one of the most promising alternatives to conventional desalination technologies for years, owing to its high evaporation efficiency induced by heat localization, sustainability and low cost. In this review, we comprehensively analyze the critical issues involved in solar-driven interfacial desalination from the energy flow perspective in light of the progress in state-of-the-art research, including photothermal conversion mechanisms and the regulation of light absorption, as well as the thermal management, water transport, salt rejection and vapor condensation of the system. In addition, we also discuss how to improve the evaporation rate above the theoretical limit and the additional electricity generation. Finally, we put forward obstacles between the theoretical research and the practical application, which we should overcome.Xinghang LiuXinghang Liu received his MS degree under the supervision of Prof. Xianbao Wang from Hubei University in 2019.

1. Introduction
According to the United Nations World Water Development Report 2019, global human water consumption has reached six times that of a century ago and is expected to increase by another 20% to 50% by 2050. Now, more than one-quarter of the world's population lives under severe water scarcity, and nearly half of the population suffers from severe water scarcity at least one month every year.1–3 To solve this widespread and devastating problem, researchers have turned their attention to seawater desalination because about 97.5% of the world's total water is not directly drinkable seawater.4 Therefore, it is extremely urgent to seek efficient, large-scale and sustainable desalination technologies. Traditional desalination technologies, including reverse osmosis (RO),5 multi-stage flash distillation (MSF),6 multi-effect distillation (MED)7 and vapor compression distillation (VCD),8 require not only high-cost and complex infrastructure and installations, but also intensive traditional energy consumption. This is an insurmountable obstacle for off-grid or poor regions. In addition, these technologies at the cost of energy and the environment run counter to global sustainable development.
Inspired by natural evaporation as an important part of the terrestrial freshwater supply, solar-driven vapor generation for desalination using solar energy as the only energy source is a prospective strategy to produce fresh water with negligible environmental impact.9 However, the natural vaporization efficiency is too low to meet the actual requirements of freshwater supply due to the poor light-absorption of water and serious heat loss to the non-evaporative part. With the development of nanophotonics theory and nanofabrication technology, SDIE technology has been proposed.10–15 Through the structural design of nanomaterials as well as the effective regulation of optics and thermology, the solar energy harvested by the photothermal materials is sufficiently converted into heat energy and localized to heat the thin layer of water at the water–air interface to generate vapor, which is subsequently condensed to produce fresh water.16–18
Although solar-driven evaporation technologies have attracted widespread attention in recent years (nearly 1000 publications have been published over the past 15 years), no comprehensive and in-depth review of the whole process of SDIE for desalination has been reported using the water productivity rate as a target performance metric (Fig. 1). For example, Hu et al. discussed the diverse structural design and engineering strategies used to improve evaporation performance, including the design principles for high-efficiency light-to-heat conversion, optimization of thermal management, water transport, interface wettability, and anti-salt-blocking structures.19 And they also described the potential applications of this attractive technology in a variety of energy and environmental fields. Nevertheless, they mainly highlighted materials and structural engineering toward high evaporation performance, ignoring the subsequent vapor condensation process and how to achieve a high water production rate synergistically. From quite a different perspective, Lin et al. critically discussed the fundamental principles of designing an efficient solar-thermal desalination system from both material development and system design perspectives.20 And the limitations of energy efficiency for solar-thermal desalination systems were also discussed by comparing solar-thermal desalination to the energy efficiency of solar desalination based on photovoltaic-driven reverse osmosis. Importantly, they elucidated the potential of markedly enhancing the performance of solar-thermal desalination systems by implementing measures for latent heat recovery, but neglected the collection of environmental energy and the reduction of vaporization enthalpy. As the only review currently devoted to solar-driven interfacial desalination, Zhou et al. combined mathematical models to summarize and analyze the critical processes occurring in the solar desalination system, including thermal conversion and transport, salt dissipation, and vapor manipulation.21 However, they focused primarily on mathematical models of heat transfer and salt dissipation for quantitative analysis of systematic performance relative to the properties of employed materials and system designs. Most previous review articles focused on only one aspect, such as the photothermal materials, thermal management or structural design, ignoring the fact that solar-driven interfacial desalination is a complex coupling process.21–28

Section 4 discusses the thermal management, water transport, salt rejection and vapor condensation in the process of efficient evaporation and condensation, and reviews the state-of-the-art developments of the four aspects via materials and structural engineering. Section 5 focuses on how to improve the evaporation rate above the theoretical limit. Section 6 introduces the additional electricity generation in the process of solar-driven interfacial desalination, and reviews the latest advancement regarding the impact of additional electricity on evaporation performance. Finally, Section 7 summarizes the whole review, pointing out the main challenges for fundamental research and practical application.

2. Development and analysis of the energy flow of SDIE
2.1. The development of the solar-driven evaporation system
Solar-driven evaporation, as a fundamental thermodynamic process, has been widely used in life and industry since ancient times.3,35,36 Solar-driven evaporation systems can be classified into three types according to the location of the photothermal material in the fluid: traditional bottom-heating-based evaporation system, suspending evaporation system, and SDIE system.37 Traditional bottom-heating-based evaporation systems (Fig. 3a), such as solar stills, enhance light absorption by blackening the bottom of water storage devices.38 However, their evaporation efficiency is relatively low (30–45%) due to the fact that the heat generated is used to heat the bulk water rather than being used directly for vapor generation.39 To reduce the heat dissipation to the bulk water, the suspending evaporation system generates vapor by dispersing plasmonic metallic, carbon-based and other nanoparticles in the fluid which in turn effectively improves evaporation efficiency by increasing the light absorption of the system and reducing the thermal resistance (Fig. 3b).40–45 However, even now, the evaporation mechanism of the suspending system is still a debatable topic. Halas et al. believed that when light was absorbed by nanoparticles, a temperature difference existed between the nanoparticles and the surrounding liquid because of a reduced thermal conductivity at the metal–liquid interface. This local temperature rise caused a vapor cladding on the surface of nanoparticles. Under continuous illumination, the vapor cladding expanded continuously and finally left the water body by buoyancy.40,46,47 Chen et al. developed numerical and analytical heat transfer models that suggested that nanofluid heating and vapor generation were attributed to the classical global heating of the suspension fluid.48 In addition, Wen et al. indicated that the initial stage of vapor generation was mainly because of the partial boiling and vaporization of the super-heated area resulting from the highly uneven temperature and radiant energy distribution.49
 Fig. 3  The development of solar-driven evaporation systems. (a) Traditional bottom-heating-based evaporation system; (b) suspending evaporation system; (c) SDIE system. 
Regardless of the vaporization mechanism of the suspending system, it is inevitable that the thermal energy converted by the photothermal materials will be dissipated to the non-evaporative portion through heat radiation, conduction and convection, resulting in a decrease in evaporation efficiency.50,51 In addition, the high cost, inhomogeneity and difficulty in recycling of nanoparticles are also huge challenges in practical applications.10 In 2014, Chen et al. proposed a revolutionary study, where a double-layer carbon-based material was applied to solar vapor generation through heat localization, reducing the unnecessary heating of the bulk water to greatly improve the evaporation efficiency.52 In the past five years, researchers have conducted in-depth research on solar-driven interfacial vapor generation from the aspects of light-to-heat conversion, thermal management, water supply and vaporization enthalpy. In the SDIE system (Fig. 3c), photothermal materials are directly set on the water surface or indirectly brought into contact with the bulk water through the confined water channel. The converted thermal energy is continuously transmitted to heat the water molecules at the water–air interface, reducing the transfer of thermal energy to the bulk water. With the introduction of various new structures, this selective heating method achieves vaporization efficiency greater than 90% without optical concentration.53–60
2.2. Analysis of the energy flow of SDIE
The SDIE system exhibits high evaporation efficiency and rate attributed to the control and management of the energy transfer process, and is widely used in various fields, especially seawater desalination.19Fig. 4 shows a schematic representation of the steady-state energy transfer process of the SDIE model. Under solar illumination, the photothermal material not only absorbs solar energy but also utilizes the underlying microstructure to pump seawater, and the heat energy produced converts the free surface seawater into vapor. The energy transfer process has been classified into three parts, viz. the light-to-heat conversion, heat-to-vapor conversion and vapor condensation processes.
 Fig. 4  Schematic diagram of the energy flow and energy balance for the SDIE device. The evaporation generator is a typical double-layer structure: the upper layer is a photothermal conversion layer, and the lower layer is a bifunctional layer of thermal insulation and water supply. 
In Fig. 4, when solar energy radiates onto the surface of the SDIE device, some of it is lost through transmission and reflection, but most of it is absorbed. According to the formula A% + R% + T% = 1 (A%, R% and T% represent the percentage of absorption, reflection, and transmission of incident light, respectively), the absorbance and photothermal conversion performance of the system can be effectively improved by reducing the reflection and transmission of the solar absorber. Since most photothermal materials of the SDIE device have a certain thickness, the transmittance is often neglected.61 Almost all photothermal materials (especially inorganic photothermal materials) have a refractive index greater than two, and according to the Fresnel equation, they have a light reflection greater than 11%.62 In the field of SDIE, the photothermal materials are usually prepared into porous nanostructures in order to reduce reflection loss of light, which reduces the effective refractive index and increases the gap reflection by the waveguide effect.63–65 In the follow-up content, we will discuss the state-of-the-art developments in detail.
The SDIE device captures the input sunlight (qsolar, W m−2) and converts it into thermal energy (assuming that all absorbed solar energy is completely converted into thermal energy by non-radiative relaxation), which is mainly used for the total enthalpy required for evaporation (qsteam). The rest is dissipated by heat conduction (qcond) to the underlying bulk water, thermal convection (qconv) with air, and heat radiation (qrad) to the environment.21 According to the analysis, the input energy and the output energy can be described by the following equation: qsolar = aqsolar + qref + qtrans(1)where a is the solar absorbance of the photothermal materials, and qref and qtrans are the solar-energy consumption by the reflection and transmission of the absorber. Moreover, the equation of heat transfer can be defined as follows:66 aqsolar = qsteam + qcond + qconv + qrad(2) (3)where νevap is the evaporation rate (kg m−2 h−1), hlv is the total enthalpy of the liquid–gas phase change (phase-change enthalpy Lv and sensible heat Q) (J kg−1), hcond is the thermal conductivity of the wetted absorber (W m−2 K−1), Tinsulator,upper, Tinsulator,bottom, Tabsor and Tambient are the temperatures of the upper layer of the insulator, the bottom layer of the insulator, the absorber and the ambient environment, respectively (K), hconv is the convective heat transfer coefficient (W m−2 K−1), d is the thickness of the insulator, εeff is the effective thermal emissivity of the absorber, and σ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant (5.67 × 10−8 W m−2 K−4).55
The evaporation efficiency (η) is a widespread index used to evaluate the evaporation performance of different photothermal materials, which can be calculated using the following equation:67,68 (4) (5)where C is the specific heat capacity of water (4.2 J g−1 K−1), and Tvapor and Twater are the temperatures of vaporization and source water, respectively (K). The vapor generated by the SDIE device is collected through condensation to produce fresh water, which releases latent heat during condensation. The recycling latent heat not only provides potential opportunities for green energy production but also improves the evaporation efficiency and rate. The collection and utilization of latent heat will be discussed in detail in Section 5.3. In order to provide readers with a more intuitive understanding of the progress of solar-driven interfacial desalination, the design concepts and performance indices of the state-of-the-art systems are summarized in Table 1.

3. Efficient light-to-heat conversion and regulation of light absorption of the SDIE system
According to eqn (1) and (2), in order to achieve efficient evaporation efficiency and rate of the system, the initial input solar energy (aqsolar) of the system should be maximized. This means that the solar absorber should maximize light absorption and light-to-heat conversion.
3.1. Efficient light absorption
High-efficiency light absorption is the primary condition for maximizing external quantum efficiency. Thus, the solar absorber should have broadband and high intensity over the entire solar spectrum (280–2500 nm, ASTM G-173, AM1.5) with minimal reflectance.26 To quantitatively describe the light absorption properties of the solar absorber, solar absorbance (a) defined as the weighted fraction between the absorbed solar energy and incident solar energy is employed:78,89 (6)where R(λ) is the reflectance of the absorber at wavelength λ, and S(λ) is the solar spectral irradiance (W m−2 nm−1) referred to as solar radiant flux density per unit area.
The distribution of illuminance and wavelength under the AM1.5 solar spectrum is as follows: the ultraviolet region (UV, 280–380 nm, 3% of the total power), the visible region (VIS, 380–780 nm, 50% of the total power) and the near-infrared region (NIR, 780–2500 nm, 47% of the total power).26 Therefore, the photothermal materials of the SDIE device should possess high absorbance in the UV, VIS and NIR regions to ensure the maximum input energy.
3.2. Effective light-to-heat conversion
As we mentioned above, the efficiencies of light absorption and light-to-heat conversion determine the initial input energy of the system, and play a decisive role in the evaporation system. However, the light-to-heat conversion performance of the solar absorbers has attracted less attention than the light absorption. In the field of SDIE, it is desirable for the absorber to lower radiation re-emission loss to maximize the solar-thermal conversion. In fact, most photothermal materials have remarkable light-to-heat conversion performance. Govorov et al. performed a set of light-induced heating experiments in water droplets containing gold nanoparticles, which indicated that their photothermal conversion efficiency was very close to 1.90 Wu et al. applied a modified photocalorimetric method to determine that Ti2O3 nanoparticles could convert almost all the absorbed photons to heat.75 Wang et al. reported MXene Ti3C2 and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with nearly 100% light-to-heat conversion efficiency through a droplet-based light absorption and heat measurement system.91 Therefore, it is generally believed that the light absorbed by photothermal materials can be effectively transformed to heat energy for utilization. At present, in order to maximize the heat utilization of the vaporization system, researchers mainly maximize the heat production by improving light absorption, and minimize the heat loss by controlling heat conduction, convection and radiation.
3.3. Photothermal conversion mechanisms
When solar energy is captured, it can be converted into various types of energy by photoexcitation, such as thermal, electrical and chemical energy. Among them, conversion into thermal energy is a direct conversion process with the highest energy efficiency. The materials absorb electromagnetic radiation, and the temperature is raised through lattice vibration or electronic oscillation. Based on the electronic structure or band structure of the materials, the photothermal conversion mechanism is classified into three categories: plasmonic resonance heating, non-radiative relaxation of semiconductors and thermal vibration of molecules.19,26

3.3.1. Plasmonic resonance heating. 
The unique negative dielectric response of metals allows them to support only surface plasmon modes (optical coupling modes of collective oscillation of free electrons near the metal surface). Metallic nanoparticles with a curved surface possess localized surface plasma modes that are related to the photoexcitation frequency and independent of the wave vector of the excitation light.24,92 Due to its unique sub-wavelength light limitation, size- and shape-tunable resonance frequency and controllable preparation, plasmonic metallic nanoparticles have attracted extensive attention in the field of SDIE. As shown in Fig. 5a, when the incident light illuminates the surface of the metallic nanoparticles, if the frequency of the incident light matches that of the collective oscillation of the free electrons, the so-called localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect would occur. This would cause three consecutive phenomena: near field enhancement, thermal electron generation and photothermal conversion.25,26,93 The frequency resonance triggers the collective excitation of electrons into hot electrons. These excited hot electrons oscillate consistently with the incident electromagnetic field, then carriers are multiplied by radiation attenuation or electron–electron interaction.92,94 In addition, the electron–electron scattering process causes the carriers to redistribute energy, resulting in the self-heating of the plasmonic structure; thereby, thermal energy is transferred to the environment through thermal conduction.95,96 Since the metallic nanoparticles have abundant free electrons and energy density higher than the Fermi level EF, as well as high thermal conductivity, they exhibit a faster photothermal response compared with the semiconductors and the conjugated materials. So far, plasma metallic materials such as gold (Au),18,58,69,97 silver (Ag),72,98 platinum (Pd),65 aluminum (Al),70 copper (Cu)99 and indium100 have been widely explored in the SDIE.
 Fig. 5  Three types of the photothermal conversion mechanisms of the photothermal materials. (a) Plasmonic resonance heating; (b) non-radiative relaxation of semiconductors; (c) thermal vibration of molecules. 
Last but not least, semiconductor materials such as copper sulfide compounds (Cu2−xS, Cu9S5) and transition metal oxides (WO3−x) show the LSPR effect due to structural defects (they are different from the non-radiative relaxation of intrinsic semiconductors), and they have strong absorption in the NIR region.101–104 The intensity of the plasmon resonance effect is determined by the carrier concentration regardless of the morphology, which is responsible for their good photothermal stability.


3.3.2. Non-radiative relaxation of semiconductors. 
For intrinsic semiconductor materials, the broad spectral absorption can be achieved through adjusting their bandgap energy (Eg). When the incident photon energy (Eph) is higher than the Eg, the semiconductor material excites the transition to generate electron–hole pairs (Fig. 5b).75 Then the electron–hole pairs relax to the edge of the energy band, and the energy is released through Auger recombination, radiation relaxation in the photon form or non-radiative relaxation in the phonon form through transferring the energy to the impurities/defects or surface dangling bonds of a permissible energy level.25,105 When energy is released in the form of phonons, it can cause lattice heating to convert energy into heat. Due to their low cost, ease of preparation, good chemical stability and adjustable absorption spectrum, semiconductor materials, such as titanium-based semiconductors (Ti2O3,75 black TiO2,56,106,107 black TiOx (ref. 108) and Ti3C2 MXene91), magnetic particles (Fe3O4,77 ZnFe2O4, MnFe2O4 and CoFe2O4 (ref. 109)), commercial spectrally selective solar absorbers,30,66,110 Cu2ZnSnSe4,111 HCuPO,112 Cu12Sb4S13 (ref. 113) and MoS2,114,115 have been widely used as effective photothermal materials in SDIE.


3.3.3. Thermal vibration of molecules. 
Carbon-based materials and conjugated polymers have abundant π bonds, and their electron binding strength is weak. Usually, the lower energy can excite the π bond to a π* bond, and the increasing π bonds can reduce the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). When the incident photon energy matches with the intramolecular electron transition, the electron is excited from the HOMO to the LUMO, and relaxes to the ground state by electron–phonon coupling relaxation. The macro-temperature of materials is increased by releasing thermal energy of the lattice vibration during the process (Fig. 5c).24,25 Carbon-based materials and conjugated polymers have high absorption in the NIR region due to their conjugated structure, and carbon-based materials are more suitable for broadband light absorption if they have a certain thickness. So far, carbon-based materials, such as carbon black (CB),17,79,116 CNTs,67,117 graphite,52,118,119 graphene,64,120 graphene oxide (GO),121–123 reduced graphene oxide (rGO)87,124 and graphdiyne,125 and conjugated polymers, such as polypyrrole (PPy),88,126,127 polyaniline,128 polydopamine (PDA),129–132 polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)31,87,88 and poly(1,3,5-hexahydro-1,3,5-triazine),128 have been extensively explored for SDIE.

3.4. Tuning of efficient light absorption
The foremost condition for the system to achieve efficient vaporization efficiency and rate is that the solar absorber should have high intensity and broadband light absorption capability so that the system can obtain the largest energy input. The methods of light absorption regulation are also different due to the difference in dielectric response and absorption mechanism of the materials. Next, we will discuss the tuning methods of light absorption for plasmonic metals, semiconductors, carbon-based materials and conjugated polymers, respectively (mainly based on examples in the SDIE field).

3.4.1. Plasmonic metals. 
The light absorption properties of metallic nanoparticles are mainly determined by the LSPR effect, which is affected by the nanoscale-confined geometry, dielectric environment and assembled structure of the plasmonic metals. In this section, we mainly start from microscopic regulation (geometry regulation, local dielectric environment) and macroscopic regulation (arrangement distribution, introduction of porous nano-/micro-structures and material hybridization). As shown in Fig. 6a and b, by adjusting the aspect ratio or size of the metallic nanoparticles, the position of the resonance band can be changed, but the absorption peak is still limited and the absorption range cannot be expanded.133,134 However, the light absorption range of nanoparticles can be expanded by creating a hollow structure or changing the geometry (Fig. 6c and d).134,135 Furthermore, a change in the dielectric environment can influence the formant position of the LSPR effect and extend the absorption range.136 Wang et al. prepared hybrid nanoparticles composed of a Au core and Cu2O dense shell; by adjusting the dielectric constant of the shell Cu2O, the plasmonic resonance peak of the Au particle gradually red shifted and was significantly enlarged (Fig. 6e).137

Plasmonic metallic nanoparticles are used in the SDIE field, usually by introducing porous nano-/micro-structures and a delicate arrangement distribution inducing plasmonic coupling to obtain the efficient light absorption. Deng et al. utilized a self-assembly process to fabricate self-floating films of Au nanoparticles at the water–air interface to achieve the broadband light absorption.138 In order to enhance the system's stability, they then deposited Au nanoparticles on air-laid paper to achieve 87% light absorption, because air-laid paper with large-scale surface roughness could increase the scattering of incident light and improve the light absorption (Fig. 6f).69 Yin et al. deposited black Ag nanoparticles on the surface of filter paper through a vacuum filtration process, which showed 92% light absorption in the full spectrum (280–2500 nm).73 In 2015, Kang et al. fabricated flexible thin-film black Au membranes with multiscale and funnel structures to achieve the average light absorption of 91% in the range of 400–2500 nm (Fig. 6g), which was attributed to the small taper angle and varying nanogaps between aggregated metallic nanowires.97 To further improve light absorption, in 2017, Zhu et al. fabricated plasmonic absorbers through self-assembly of Au nanoparticles onto nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) by a one-step deposition process to achieve light absorption of ∼99% (400 nm to 10 μm) (Fig. 6h).18 In this absorber, Au nanoparticles with random sizes and distributions enabled a high density of hybridized LSPRs to effectively absorb light in a wide wavelength range, and the nanoporous AAO templates provided an impedance match for efficient reflection reduction and coupling to the optical modes. To reduce the cost of the system, they also synthesized a 3D porous membrane with an effective solar absorption of over 96%, fabricated by depositing Al nanoparticles on an AAO template.70 In 2017, Hu et al. uniformly decorated fine metal nanoparticles (Au, Ag and Pd) into the 3D mesoporous matrix of natural wood, which exhibited 99% light absorption (200–2500 nm). This was due to the plasmonic effect of metallic nanoparticles and the waveguide effect of microchannels in the wood matrix (Fig. 6i).65
Furthermore, the hybridization of materials is also an effective control method due to the synergistic effect. Metallic nanoparticles combined with other materials can not only improve light absorption but also form multifunctional nanocomposites.139,140 El-Shall et al. reported plasmonic graphene polyurethane nanocomposite materials (Ag/Au-GO-PU) with a very wide-ranging light absorption.141 Tao et al. designed a bifunctional membrane consisting of a top layer of TiO2 nanoparticles, a middle layer of Au NPs, and a bottom layer of AAO, which opened up a new strategy for maximizing solar energy conversion and utilization (Fig. 6j).142


3.4.2. Semiconductors. 
From the microscopic point of view, the light absorption properties of semiconductors are determined by their electronic band structure. Doping is an effective method to broaden the light absorption range of semiconductors. According to the change in the energy band structure of the doped semiconductors, the doping methods can be classified into three categories.26
In the first category, doping extends the spectral absorption range by introducing shallow- and deep-level states without changing the bandgap of semiconductors (Fig. 7a). In 2017, Guo et al. fabricated an evaporation membrane by depositing MoO3−x quantum dots on cellulose acetate filter, which resulted in a broad and strong photoabsorption band caused by the oxygen defect level (Fig. 7d).104 The second category is of doping to reduce the bandgap of semiconductors without introducing a localized state (Fig. 7b). In 2016, Huang et al. designed and synthesized hydrophobic black TiO2 films with a unique nanocage structure to obtain enhanced visible-light absorption (Fig. 7e), which was mainly due to the trapping effect of nanocages as well as the introduction of surface disorder and oxygen vacancies that destroyed the lattice periodicity and reduced the bandgap.106 Thereafter, reduced black TiOx,108 moth-eye-like black TiO2 (ref. 56) and narrow-bandgap Ti2O3 (ref. 75) have been reported, respectively, all of which had excellent full-spectrum absorption. In the last category, degenerately doped semiconductors with a distinct free carrier concentration exhibit the LSPR effect (Fig. 7c). Chen et al. synthesized a 3D plasmonic covellite CuS hierarchical nanostructure with broadband and highly efficient light absorption in the wavelength range of 300–2500 nm; the strong light absorption over the NIR region > 700 nm originated from the LSPRs of the free carrier in CuS nanoparticles.143

Besides the above microscopic control methods, from a macroscopic point of view, the light-trapping structure design of semiconductor materials and hybridizing them with other materials are also good methods to improve the light absorption. Wang et al. designed and fabricated MoS2 nanoflower and moth-eye-like black titania nanocomposites to achieve light absorption greater than 90%.56,114 The light-trapping structure not only results in multiple reflections and lengthens the light absorption path but also reduces the dependence on the incident light angle. In addition, analogous to TiO2/C,144 MoS2/SWNTs (single-walled nanotubes)76 and Fe3O4/C,77 composites of materials also significantly improve the light absorption of the system.


3.4.3. Carbon-based materials. 
Carbon-based materials such as CB,17 CNTs,146 graphite,147 graphene,120 GO,148 rGO,149 graphdiyne (GDY),125etc. have become the most popular photothermal materials in the SDIE field due to their broadband light absorption. The increase in light absorption capacity of carbon-based materials is mainly through achieving high absorption intensity and low reflectance. The most effective method is to design nanostructures with different geometries, including porous, aligned and hierarchical nanostructures. The use of these structures can prolong the effective propagation path of light to increase the reflection and scattering of light, thereby enhancing light absorption while at the same time reducing the dependence on the angle of incident light.
In 2014, Chen et al. developed a double-layer porous structure consisting of a carbon foam layer supporting an exfoliated graphite layer to achieve a light absorbance of 97% (250–2250 nm).52 Subsequently, 0D, 1D and 2D carbon materials have been used to prepare porous SDIE devices with high light absorption, respectively. For example, the unique structure of Janus possessed a full-wave band absorbance of about 97%, consisting of an upper hydrophobic carbon black nanoparticle coated polymethylmethacrylate layer and a lower hydrophilic polyacrylonitrile layer.150 A bilayer aerogel structure employing cellulose nanofibrils as basic building blocks as well as a CNT layer for efficient solar utilization achieved light absorption of over 97.5% in the wavelength range from 300 nm to 1200 nm.146 Porous rGO-polyurethane nanocomposite foam absorbed 91% of the irradiated sunlight (300–1500 nm).151
The microchannels of the vertical array can effectively capture light and are widely used in the light absorption control of carbon-based materials. In 2017, Qu et al. prepared a long-range vertically aligned graphene sheet membrane (VA-GSM), which could absorb approximately 93% of the UV, 98% of the visible, and nearly 100% of the near-infrared solar irradiation (Fig. 8a).152 They also fabricated highly vertically ordered pillar arrays of graphene-assembled framework (HOPGF) with ca. 98–98.5% sunlight absorption in the full solar spectrum range (Fig. 8b).153 In addition, Zhang et al. reported vertically aligned CNT arrays with optical absorption of 0.98–0.99 over a large spectral range of 200 nm–200 μm.117 Natural array structures in natural wood are also widely used as photothermal materials (after carbonization) and matrix materials.65,118,154,155 Hu et al. proposed surface-carbonized longitudinal and horizontal woods for scalable solar vapor generation, which showed excellent light absorption properties (Fig. 8c).81,156 Many other carbonized biomass materials, such as mushrooms,157 eggshell membrane,158 lotus seedpods159 and daikon,160 have been reported. In addition, carbonized carbonaceous materials, such as carbonized melamine foams,161 carbonized bread162 and carbonized tissue membrane,163 also exhibit outstanding light absorption.

Besides improving light absorption, 3D hierarchical nanostructured carbon-based materials can also accomplish omnidirectional light absorption. In 2017, Liu et al. reported hierarchical graphene (h-G) foam with continuous porosity to achieve high absorption of the full spectrum and minimize the dependence of the incident light due to a porous and oriented hierarchical structure (Fig. 8d).64 In addition, they designed a hierarchical graphdiyne-based architecture with vertical 2D GDY nanosheets anchoring 1D CuO nanowires, which showed an average light absorption of 92% in the visible to near-IR range and 86% over the whole range of the solar spectrum.125


3.4.4. Conjugated polymers. 
Due to their low cost, light weight, flexibility and controllable manufacturing, conjugated polymers (π-conjugated backbones of contiguous sp2-hybridized carbon atoms) have become promising photothermal materials in the field of SDIE.164 However, their absorption bandwidth is narrow. Broadening of the absorption spectrum of the conjugated polymers is mainly through molecular structure design and doping, such as the donor–acceptor (D–A) approach,165,166 oxidative doping167 and protonic acid doping,168 which can effectively reduce the bandgap. In 2015, Wang et al. reported a photothermal membrane (the bipolaronic metallic state of doped PPy, with Fe3+ acting as the oxidizing agent) with hydrophobicity self-healing capability for interfacial solar heating based on a PPy coated stainless steel (SS) mesh to achieve the broadband absorption.126 Niu et al. fabricated novel PPy–FexOy–CTS gel membranes via synthesizing PPy in chitosan (CTS) sol in situ, showing good light-absorbing properties (Fig. 9a).169 In 2017, Ji et al. designed and synthesized new porous polymers (1,3,5-hexahydro-1,3,5-triazines, consisting mainly of the aniline trimer) with light absorption of 95.2% (Fig. 9b).128 In 2018, Yu et al. reported a highly hydratable light-absorbing hydrogel (h-LAH) consisting of polyvinyl alcohol and chitosan as the hydratable skeleton and PPy as the light absorber, which achieved outstanding light absorption performance (Fig. 9c).88

Besides the intrinsic strategy, the introduction of a light-harvesting structure can also improve the light absorption capacity of the conjugated polymer system. Xu et al. fabricated multilayer PPy nanosheets with spontaneously formed surface structures such as wrinkles and ridges via sequential polymerization on paper substrates, capable of absorbing more than 99% of the solar energy (Fig. 9d).85 And Jiang et al. designed a 3D photothermal cone with a PPy coating layer that yielded satisfactory light absorption of around 99.2% in the entire solar spectrum.127

4. Efficient heat-to-vapor conversion and vapor condensation
Heat-to-vapor conversion is an extremely complicated process in SDIE for desalination. Only a reasonable solution to the problems of thermal management, water transport, salt deposition and vapor condensation can achieve efficient seawater desalination. These four issues will be discussed in depth in this section.
4.1. Thermal management
According to eqn (3) and Fig. 4, the solar absorber captures the incident sunlight and converts it into heat energy, which is not only used for vapor generation but also dissipated to the underlying bulk water and the surrounding environment through heat conduction (qcond), heat convection (qconv) and heat radiation (qrad). In order to obtain high evaporation efficiency and rate, the system must achieve effective thermal management and reduce thermal losses in three channels to localize thermal energy for vapor generation. Next we will discuss the intrinsic strategies (material modification) and the extrinsic strategies (structural design) for the manipulation of heat loss.

4.1.1. Heat conduction. 
As shown in Fig. 10 (SE model), when the solar absorber is in direct contact with the bulk water without any insulation, the system approximately dissipates 43% of its energy into the underlying bulk water by heat conduction, which accounts for the largest portion of the total heat loss.82 Suppressing the heat conduction loss is therefore extremely critical for the SDIE system. The conductive heat loss can be quantified in accordance with Fourier's law of heat conduction (based on the model in Fig. 4): (7) (8)where ∅ denotes the conduction heat flux (W),  is the temperature gradient from the upper surface to the bottom surface of the insulator (K m−1), and A is the upper surface area of the insulator (m2). Based on the above equations, it can be concluded that the heat conduction loss flux depends on the thermal conductivity (hcond) and temperature gradient  In the field of SDIE, heat conduction loss can be suppressed mainly by reducing thermal conductivity (intrinsic strategy) and designing an insulation structure (extrinsic strategy).
 Fig. 10  Evolution of the water transport structure of SDIE and COMSOL simulation of temperature distribution. Section diagram (upper) and 3D diagram (lower) of heat transfer. SE: self-floating absorber (without any thermal barrier) using its own porous structure for water supply; BI: bifunctional water channel (thermal barrier and water supply); 2D: 2D water channel; 1D: 1D water channel. Note: COMSOL simulation parameters: (1) solar intensity (1 kW m−2); (2) the absorbance of the solar absorber (carbon-based material) is 0.95; (3) the thermal conductivity of the bifunctional water channel is 0.426 W m−1 K−1; the white PS foam with a thermal conductivity of 0.04 W m−1 K−1 acts as a thermal barrier (model of 2D water channel), and the air-laid paper with a thermal conductivity of 0.6 W m−1 K−1 acts as 2D and 1D water channels because it is filled with a lot of water. 
The straightforward way to reduce the thermal conductivity is to design materials as microporous structures. Microporous structural materials utilize air as the thermal barrier to reduce the thermal conductivity; the greater the porosity, the lower the thermal conductivity. Qu et al. fabricated highly vertically ordered pillar arrays of graphene-assembled framework to obtain a low thermal conductivity of 18–35 mW m−1 K−1.153 Zhu et al. reported a free-floating GO-based aerogel with a thermal conductivity of 0.0047–0.035 W m−1 K−1.123 Chen et al. fabricated nitrogen-doped porous graphene sheets which exhibited a low thermal conductivity of 9.0 ± 1.2 W m−1 K−1 (Fig. 11a).170 It is worth noting that the effective thermal conductivity of a material cannot reach the expected value because water entering the pores can destroy the thermal insulation performance in the evaporation process. For example, Liu et al. fabricated pre-pressed melamine foam with PPy coating, and the PPy layer had a thermal conductivity of 0.06 W m−1 K−1 in the dry state and 0.48 W m−1 K−1 in the wet state.171 The thermal conductivity of the wet-state material should therefore be regarded as the effective thermal conductivity in the vaporization process while optimizing the water permeability of the material to obtain the lowest possible thermal conductivity.

Another way to suppress heat conduction loss is to introduce a thermal insulation structure, which can physically separate the evaporation hotspot from the bulk water. As shown in Fig. 10, effective thermal insulation has been achieved to date mainly by designing bifunctional (heat barrier and water transport), 2D and 1D water channels. In order to more intuitively evaluate the influence of different water channels on the heat transfer of the system, we constructed four models using COMSOL Multiphysics software. The thermal conduction loss is significantly suppressed by the optimizing water channel, and the thermal energy is further localized for vapor generation. In 2014, Chen et al. proposed a double-layer structure composed of a carbon foam layer supporting an exfoliated graphite layer, and the carbon foam layer was used for thermal insulation and water transport (Fig. 11b).52 Subsequently, a range of comparable double-layer systems have been reported (Fig. 10, BI model), in which air-laid paper,69,107 cellulose,172,173 AAO,18,70 leaf,174 wood,65,122 carbon foam,175 geopolymer176 and electrospun polyacrylonitrile13 were used as the materials of the bottom layer for thermal insulation and water transport. However, the performance of this thermal insulation structure is not satisfactory as water entering the pores weakens its role as a thermal barrier.
In 2016, Zhu et al. proposed GO film with a confined 2D water path, in which cellulose wrapped over the surface of polystyrene foam physically separated the photothermal material GO from the bulk water to reduce heat conduction loss and improve solar efficiency to 80% under 1 sun (1 kW m−2) (Fig. 11c).121 Compared with the double-layer evaporation structure, the introduction of the 2D water channel not only separates the photothermal materials from the bulk water but also reduces the area of the water channel. In 2019, Liu et al. fabricated modified carbon fibers affixed to polystyrene foam to achieve a high thermal efficiency of 92.5% (1 kW m−2) and heat conduction loss of 3%.80 In order to further reduce the heat conduction loss, transpiration-inspired 1D water channel was designed, further reducing the area of the water channel (Fig. 10, 1D model). In 2017, Zhu et al. fabricated a carbonized mushroom which showed an energy conversion efficiency of 78% and heat conduction loss of only 0.2% (Fig. 11d).157 In 2018, Miao et al. designed an evaporation device where carbonized natural wood as a solar absorber was embedded in expanded polyethylene foam and an air-laid paper wick served as a water channel, which achieved a solar vapor generation efficiency of 91.3% (1 kW m−2) and heat conduction loss of 4.5%.55 In 2019, Huang et al. proposed a carbon-black/cellulose-sponge system with water supply through injection, achieving not only an evaporation efficiency of 91.5% (1 kW m−2) but also a heat conduction loss of only 0.714%.177 Although the optimization of the water channel significantly improves the evaporation efficiency and reduces the heat conduction loss, the problem of salt deposition should be avoided. We will discuss the balance between water transport and salt deposition later.


4.1.2. Heat radiation. 
The top surface of the SDIE system is primarily based on heat radiation and heat convection loss. Especially at high temperatures, heat radiation loss can be significant. The heat radiation loss can be calculated using the Stefan–Boltzmann law: qrad = εeffσTabsor4 − εambientσTambient4(9)where εambient is the thermal emissivity of the ambient environment. Currently, there is controversy about the selection of Tambient in the state-of-the-art literature because vapor and water are semitransparent to heat radiation.175 Some researchers believe that room temperature should be selected,178 and others believe that the upper vapor temperature should be selected due to the presence of a hot vapor and water layer above the photothermal materials.117 No matter which temperature is selected, εeff < εambient < 1. Therefore, eqn (9) can be simplified as the following: qrad = εeffσ(Tabsor4 − Tambient4)(10)
The effective thermal emissivity (εeff) can be calculated as179 (11)where Mabsor(Tabsor) and Mbb(Tabsor) are the spectral radiation emittance of the absorber and the standard blackbody at the temperature of the absorber, ε(λ) is the thermal emissivity of the absorber, and Ebb(Tabsor,λ) is the thermal irradiance of the standard blackbody. According to eqn (10), the heat radiation loss depends on the effective thermal emissivity (εeff) and the temperature of the absorber (Tabsor).
The surface temperatures of the solar absorbers determine the region of the thermal radiation window. Ideal solar absorbers require not only high solar absorption in the solar spectrum (280–2500 nm) but also low thermal emissivity in the region of the thermal radiation window (2000 nm–25 μm), which can effectively suppress the thermal radiation loss.89 Spectrally selective absorbers with these two properties have been used in the field of SDIE. For instance, Chen et al. proposed a spectrally selective solar absorber (cermet-type absorber, α = 0.9 and εeff = 0.07) for generating 100 °C vapor under ambient air conditions without optical concentration, which only lost 5% heat energy through thermal radiation (Fig. 11e).66 However, spectrally selective absorbers face some challenges in SDIE applications, such as poor long-term resistance to seawater,180 and the dense substrate preventing the escape of vapor and requiring the manual cutting of the evaporation slot. With the introduction of the solar membrane distillation system, the vapor was compelled to flow downward, breaking the limitations of spectrally selective absorbers.30,110
Structural design is also an effective method to reduce the surface temperatures of the absorber, thereby decreasing the thermal radiation. Increasing the effective evaporation area of the absorber can effectively reduce its evaporation temperature. Zhu et al. proposed a 3D artificial transpiration device to not only achieve an evaporation efficiency of 85% but also lose only 7% of the thermal energy through thermal radiation, and its evaporation temperature was 32.7 °C (Fig. 11f).82 Similar structural designs include carbonized mushrooms,157 a 3D cylindrical cup-shaped structure78 and an environmental energy-enhanced interfacial solar vapor generator.79 The latter two types of evaporation devices can not only reduce the heat radiation loss by decreasing the evaporation temperature, but also acquire energy from the environment to improve the evaporation efficiency and rate above the theoretical limits (this will be discussed in detail in Section 5.1). In particular, the 3D cylindrical cup-shaped structure can utilize the inner wall to recycle the cup bottom radiation and convection heat loss in addition to using the low temperature outer wall to reduce heat radiation. Chen et al. recently proposed a contactless evaporation device to generate superheating vapor via thermal radiation, which cleverly utilized heat radiation and solved the problem of scale fouling of the absorber.181


4.1.3. Heat convection. 
Heat convection is a complex heat transfer phenomenon combining heat conduction with fluid movement. The heat convection loss can be calculated using Newton's law of cooling: qconv = hconv(Tabsor − Tambient)(12)
According to the above equation, in addition to decreasing the surface temperatures through structural design to suppress heat convection loss, another method is to reduce the convection heat transfer coefficient (hconv). However, hconv is affected by many intrinsic and extrinsic factors: (1) type of fluid and phase change; (2) fluid properties, such as viscosity, specific heat, density and volume expansion coefficient; (3) temperature of the fluid; (4) fluid flow state; (5) cause of fluid flow (forced convection, natural convection); (6) shape, size and position of the heat transfer surface. Because it is difficult to separately regulate heat convection, there are few studies on heat convection control to date. A special mention goes to Chen's group, who utilized a bubble wrap cover to transmit sunlight and minimize convective loss.66 Thus, reducing convective space is also an alternative method.

4.2. Water transport and salt dissipation
Water transport is an extremely critical factor in the vapor generation process. The water supply rate needs to be exactly matched with the vapor generation rate. Excessive water is transported, leading to increased heat conduction loss, while too little water cannot meet the requirements of vapor generation, causing the deposition of salt on the surface of the absorber, which affects the optical properties and water supply of the system. In this section, we will discuss the design of the water transport pathway, theoretically analyze factors influencing salt deposition and summarize the salt-rejection methods reported in recent years.

4.2.1. Designs of the water pathway. 
In the field of SDIE, water transport generally relies on the capillary forces generated by the porous structure. The capillary action is dependent on many factors, including the pore size and geometry, porosity, the wettability of the medium and fluid properties. In addition, the top negative pressure caused by evaporation can increase this action. In order to quantitatively analyze the water supply performance of the porous structure, a simplified model in which all the pores have a cylindrical shape is established (Fig. 12). The semi-empirical relationship proposed by Leverett is used to calculate the capillary pressure of the porous structure.182 Ergun's equation is employed to predict the pressure drop of the porous structure, which includes the viscous resistance in laminar flow (Pv) and inertial resistance loss in the turbulent regime (Pi).183,184 Besides, the gravity effects (Pg) can also cause pressure loss during water transport. The following equations can be obtained according to momentum conservation in the steady state: Pcp = Pv + Pi + Pg(13) (14)where J0 is a dimensionless function of water saturation describing the capillary pressure, σ is the surface tension (N m−1), θ is the contact angle, k is the permeability (m2), φ is the porosity, μ is the dynamic viscosity (Pa s), u is the flow rate through the cross-section of the material (m s−1), dp is the equivalent particle diameter (m), ρ is the liquid density (kg m−3), g is the gravitational acceleration (9.8 m s−2), and h is the height of water transport. The water transport rate ν can be calculated according to the superficial velocity u and the dimensional homogeneity (ν = u × ρ × S, S is the surface area of the water supply material).
 Fig. 12  Analysis of water transport in the steady state (based on the model of “BI” transport structure). 
In early evaporation devices, the vapor generators are primarily hydrophobic membranes or simplified absorbers (directly set on the water surface, without specific thermal insulation).126,185 The former does not involve the water transport design, and the latter supplies water through the capillary action of its own porous structure. For optimal trade-offs between heat conduction loss and water transport, bifunctional, 2D and 1D water pathways have been successively proposed (Fig. 10). Hu et al. proposed to use nature-made 3D interconnected micro-/nanochannels to supply water for the evaporation device of surface carbonized wood (a similar structure is summarized in Section 4.1.1).186 In order to achieve further optimization, Zhu et al. proposed to physically separate the photothermal materials from the bulk water by using 2D water pathways consisting of cellulose paper wrapped polystyrene foam and 1D water channels composed of commercial absorbent cotton rods, respectively.82,121 Subsequently, a range of comparable waterway structures have been reported. For instance, Liu et al. fabricated an activated carbon fiber cloth device with cotton fiber nonwoven fabrics as 2D water pathways for desalination, and explored the impact of the layer number of water pathways on the evaporation efficiency.187 Bai et al. reported a 3D polyacrylamide based aerogel with a radial and centrosymmetric structure to achieve a long-distance and quick antigravity water transport.188 Water transport and energy transfer are a coupling process. Thus, how to precisely match the water supply rate with the evaporation rate, minimize heat loss and avoid salt deposition simultaneously requires further research.


4.2.2. Theoretical analysis for salt deposition. 
The salt concentration on the evaporation surface gradually increases during the vapor generation process. At the same time, the salt ions diffuse back into the underlying bulk water along the water channels driven by the concentration gradient, and salt deposition occurs when the salt accumulation rate is greater than the diffusion rate. In fact, both advection and diffusion play a role in the salt rejection.189 Here we are mainly based on diffusion to conservatively calculate (ignoring the influence of advection). As shown in Fig. 4, in order to avoid salt deposition, the salt accumulation rate on the evaporation surface should be less than or equal to the rate at which the salt diffuses back into the bulk water in the steady state. Based on Fick's law of diffusion, we can obtain the following equations: (15) (16)where asalt,acc and asalt,diff are the salt accumulation rate and salt diffusion rate, respectively, Csalt,bulk and Csalt,evap are the mass fraction of salt in the bulk water and on the evaporation surface, respectively, DNacl is the diffusion coefficient of NaCl (7.16 × 10−6 m2 h−1), ρ is the density of seawater (1.04 × 103 kg m−3, the salt diffusing back into the bulk water is dispersed by natural convection), φ is the porosity of the water transport material, and dwater is the thickness of the water transport material.175Csalt,evap is assumed to be saturated (26 wt%), and the concentration of ordinary seawater (3.5 wt%) is taken as Csalt,bulk. Combining eqn (15) with (16), the following equation can be obtained: (17)
According to eqn (17), the salt deposition is related to the porosity and thickness of the water transport material as well as the light intensity. In the 2D water pathway structure, the ratio of the water pathway area to the evaporation area is equal to that of the salt diffusion rate to the evaporation rate.189 Although both reducing the thickness and increasing the porosity of the water transport material contribute to the salt rejection, the heat conduction loss is correspondingly improved. This is a complicated coupling process and should be controlled within an optimal range.


4.2.3. Salt-rejection methods. 
Although the material/structural design and vaporization efficiency/rate in the field of SDIE have been significantly developed and improved in recent years, implementing the large-scale application in seawater desalination has not been practical. The poor stability caused by the salt blockage is one of the major problems that should be solved.
The conventional methods to solve the problem of salt blockage are repeated washing, mechanical exfoliation and dip-squeezing.19,64 However, these methods not only increase production costs but also reduce production efficiency. In order to solve this issue, four kinds of innovative methods have been proposed in succession recently. The first method is to make the salt stay within the water environment of the lower layer through the hydrophobic interface.119 For example, Zhu et al. reported Janus absorbers consisting of an upper hydrophobic carbon black nanoparticle coated polymethylmethacrylate layer (CB/PMMA) and a lower hydrophilic polyacrylonitrile (PAN) layer, where salt ions would stay within the PAN layer instead of crystallizing on the CB/PMMA layer in the desalination process.13 And the evaporation rate of the Janus absorber was found to be stable over 16 d (1 kW m−2) (Fig. 13a). Although this method can effectively prevent salt deposition, it sacrifices the thermal insulation effect of the system. The second method is to use diffusion and convection to dissolve salt ions from the evaporation surface into the underlying water bulk.29,124,187 For instance, Hu et al. utilized surface-carbonized bimodal porous balsa wood membrane for high-salinity (15 wt%) water desalination. The unique bimodal porous and 3D interconnected microstructure was capable of rapidly replenishing surface-evaporated brine by diffusion, convection and capillary pumping to ensure continuous and rapid generation of water vapor. Its evaporation rate was almost unchanged (1.7 kg m−1 h−1) when exposed to 2 suns for 20 days, with 7 h per day (Fig. 13b).186 In addition, Chen et al. designed and fabricated a floating solar still with simultaneous salt-rejection and heat localization capability. The top layer was a solar absorbing layer of hydrophilic black cellulose fabric, and the lower layer was made from alternating layers of expanded polystyrene foam and white cellulose fabric.2 They carefully calculated the wick-to-evaporation area ratio to ensure that the salt ions accumulated in the evaporation surface could be dissolved back into the underlying bulk water by diffusion and convection. This evaporation structure could not only reject salt for 7 d but could also dissolve and reject salt deposits under one sun (Fig. 13c). By regulating diffusion and convection, both heat localization and salt resistance can be achieved, which is currently the most prevalent technique. The third method is to achieve both salt rejection and collection through structural design. For instance, Zhang et al. proposed a novel structural design to spatially isolate salt crystals from the evaporation surface to achieve edge-preferential crystallization and gravity-assisted salt harvesting (Fig. 13d).190 The final method is that the evaporation structure is not in contact with water, which was proposed by Chen's group (Fig. 13e).181 In this non-contact evaporation device, the surface water was heated by thermal radiation in order to avoid salt deposition in the absorber, and superheated vapor was produced in one sun and without the need for pressurization.

4.3. Vapor condensation
In the process of solar desalination, a transparent cover is usually used to condense and collect the vapor generated by the solar energy, thereby obtaining freshwater resources. Compared with the evaporation rate, the water production rate is a more intuitive performance index, which depends on the vaporization rate and condensation collection rate. Although the evaporation efficiency and rate have achieved high levels at present, the vapor condensation effect is poor or even neglected, which is a major bottleneck restricting practical application (Table 1). In the vapor condensation process, the vapor forms a water film or an array of water droplets on the transparent cover through condensation, coalescence and transportation, which causes optical loss and in turn affects the water production rate.191 In addition, when the vapor condensation rate is lower than the vapor generation rate, the temperature of the evaporation surface and the relative humidity of the system are increased to suppress vaporization.
In an experiment performed by Chen and coworkers, substituting glass covers with polyester covers in their floating solar still resulted in an optical loss of 35%.189 This is primarily due to the high contact angle between water and a hydrophobic polymer, which makes it easy to form an array of water droplets. However, the water film is more transparent than the array of water droplets (Fig. 14a).192 Therefore, the optical loss can be reduced using a hydrophilic transparent polymer cover, and the contact angle should be less than 50°.193 Although the glass cover has better light transmittance and higher water yield, it is considered to be fragile and has high replacement cost. Historically, the polymer cover is more in line with practical requirements. In addition, changing the vapor condensation position is also an effective way to eliminate the impact of condensed water on the transparency of the cover. For example, Yu et al. used airflow as the carrier to transport the vapor to the lower part of the condensation chamber, staggering the condensation position from the energy input position to eliminate the effect of condensation on the light transmission (Fig. 14b).86 In addition, Zhou et al. designed and fabricated a compact solar-thermal membrane distillation system that utilized a microporous hydrophobic membrane to force the vapor to flow downward and condense, thereby separating the energy input and vapor condensation on both sides of the membrane to avoid the effects of condensation on the incident light.30 At the same time, it eliminated the reduction of condensation rate due to the temperature rise of the transparent cover during the condensation (Fig. 14d).

In practical operations, the vaporization efficiency and water production rate are suppressed when the vapor condensation is insufficient, especially in closed water collection systems. Zhu et al. demonstrated that the evaporation efficiency fell from 75% to 18% from the open system to the semi-closed system.173 Therefore, the increase in the condensation area can increase the water production rate (Fig. 14c).194 In addition, by reducing the temperature of the condensing cover through external cooling,195 adjusting the inclination angle,196 and reducing the thickness and thermal conductivity,192,197 the water yield can be increased.
5. Improving the evaporation rate above the theoretical limit
To improve the evaporation rate in the recent past, most of the research has focused on enhancing the optical properties of the absorber and diminishing the heat loss of the system (but not completely eliminating it). A common feature of these studies is that the temperature of the absorber (Tabsor) is higher than the environmental temperature (Tenvironment). Under these circumstances, according to eqn (4) and (5), assuming a 100% evaporation efficiency, the evaporation process is from 25 °C water to 25 °C vapor (hlv = 2456 kJ kg−1), and the theoretical maximum evaporation rate is 1.47 kg m−2 h−1 under 1 kW m−2 solar illumination, which cannot meet the practical demand for water supply. In order to break through the limit rate value, three effective methods have been proposed, namely collecting the environmental energy, reducing vaporization enthalpy and recycling latent heat. In this part we will discuss the principle and implementation of these three methods on the basis of the state-of-the-art developments.
5.1. Collecting environmental energy
Water evaporation is a natural process that occurs under all conditions regardless of solar radiation.198 In the darkness, dark evaporation occurs when the humidity of the wet absorber is higher than that of the environment, which is often subtracted as the background in conventional interfacial vaporization (the dark evaporation is negligible compared with light-driven evaporation). In addition, the evaporation rate is strongly associated with temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, and air convection. The lower relative humidity/higher ambient temperature may result in higher evaporation rate, and lower relative humidity may increase the evaporation surface temperature. As shown in Fig. 15a, when Tabsor is higher than Tenvironment, solar energy is the only source of energy (qtotal = aqsolar). The converted heat energy is not only used for vaporization but also lost to the environment through heat transfer, resulting in a lower vaporization rate than the theoretical limit. However, when Tabsor is lower than Tenvironment, the input energy channel from the environment is opened. The system obtains energy from the environment through heat conduction, radiation and convection in addition to absorbing solar energy (qtotal = aqsolar + qenvironment), and the vaporization rate can be increased above the theoretical limit (Fig. 15b).

In 2018, Zhu et al. designed and fabricated a cylindrical vapor generator consisting of various cotton cores wrapped with plant cellulose coated with carbon black nanoparticles (96% light absorption).79 This solar evaporator with a low projection ratio (0.085, the projected area relative to the actual area) was designed to effectively separate light absorption and evaporation to achieve environmental energy input (Fig. 15c). The top surface of the absorber absorbed solar energy for evaporation, and the top evaporation removed some of the heat energy of the side surface. However, the side surface absorbed less solar energy that the top surface, causing a much lower temperature of the side surface than the ambient temperature. The temperature difference drove the system to take the ambient energy through heat convection and radiation injection to increase the evaporation rate. Under the illumination of 1 kW m−2, this environmental energy-enhanced interfacial solar vapor generator obtained an energy of 123 W m−2 from the environment and achieved evaporation rates of 1.62 kg m−2 h (pure water) and 1.59 kg m−2 h−1 (seawater). It has also been confirmed that the lower light intensity and lower absorber surface temperature can gain more energy from the environment and achieve higher enhancement factors (the ratio of the actual evaporation rate to the theoretical limit). In the same year, Wang et al. fabricated 3D cylindrical cup-shaped structures of mixed metal oxide as a solar evaporator. The energy loss due to the light diffuse reflection and thermal radiation from the 2D bottom and the environmental energy could be reused and acquired by the upper and cooler walls of the 3D structure, respectively. It achieved an extremely high vapor generation rate of 2.04 kg m−2 h−1 (pure water) and 1.59 kg m−2 h−1 (seawater) under one sun (Fig. 15d).78 In 2019, Xu et al. designed a 3D all-in-one photothermal reservoir for a highly efficient solar-vapor generation without bulk water. The photothermal reservoir was composed of a cotton core which is able to absorb and store a large amount of water, encased in a photothermal RGO–agarose–cotton aerogel sheet which served as a water retainer, light absorber and evaporation surface. During solar-vapor generation, since no bulk water is involved, the photothermal reservoir minimizes heat conduction loss, and maximizes both the exposed evaporation surface area and net energy gain from the environment, leading to energy efficiency beyond the theoretical limit. An extremely high water evaporation rate of 4.0 kg m−2 h−1 over a photothermal reservoir with a height of 15 cm was achieved.199
Reducing the projection ratio is the most straightforward way to realize the surface temperatures of the absorber below the environmental temperature. Wang et al. explored the effect of the projection ratio on the vaporization rate by increasing the wall height of the 3D cup-shaped structure.78 The increase in wall height correspondingly decreased the projection ratio and increased the evaporation region of absorbing environmental energy, resulting in a higher evaporation rate. Gan et al. fabricated a set of triangular structures with different apex angles (θ). When θ was less than 22.4° (the carbon-coated paper was placed on the triangular foam), the temperature of the majority of the area was lower than room temperature, and the evaporation rate could reach 2.02 kg m−2 h−1 (1 kW m−2).198 When the foam was removed to further enhance the energy input of the environment to the system, an evaporation rate of 2.20 kg m−2 h−1 could be achieved.
5.2. Reducing vaporization enthalpy
In the absence of additional energy input, the evaporation rate is below the theoretical limit due to the intrinsic energy requirements of water vaporization. In 2018, Yu et al. proposed and fabricated a hierarchically nanostructured gel (HNG) for solar vapor generation. They demonstrated by evaporation and DSC measurements that the vaporization enthalpy required for water confined to the HNG molecular network (ca., 1300 J g−1, HNG3) was less than that for the bulk water (Fig. 16a–c).88 They turned to the water cluster theory to explain the decrease in evaporation enthalpy. They proposed a hypothesis that water is more likely to evaporate as small clusters rather than individual molecules due to the limitation of the HNG molecular network.

Water molecules in the liquid phase are linked through hydrogen bonds. Water clusters with minimum energy are formed by configuration variation, and the liquid water is not easily evaporated due to the dynamic stable cluster limitation.87,200 However, the hydrated solutes in water can affect the phase transition of water by changing the state of the water.31,201 According to the difference of hydrogen bonding between molecules, the water in the polymer network can be divided into three types: bound water, intermediate water and free water. The water molecules in bound water and polymer chains have strong hydrogen bonding, and the bound water easily forms weak hydrogen bonding with the surrounding water molecules.201 The free water plays the role of bulk water. The intermediate water is between the bound water and the free water, and has weak interactions with adjacent water molecules and polymer chains. Therefore, the presence of intermediate water makes polymer networks have lower evaporation enthalpy. The evaporation enthalpy can be further reduced by adjusting the proportion of intermediate water. For the qualitative analysis of water clusters for the reduction of evaporation enthalpy, the vaporization enthalpy of pure water (ΔHp-water) and water confined in the hydrogel network (ΔHcluster) can be calculated using the following equations, respectively:88 ΔHp-water = −Uinterl-water + NkT(18) ΔHcluster = −[xUinterl-water + (1 − x)Ucluster-water] + NkT(19)where Uinterl-water and Ucluster-water are the cohesive energy of the liquid water and the energy required for water clusters to escape from the water, respectively. N is the number of water molecules, T is the temperature, k is the Boltzmann constant, and x is the fraction of gas molecules in the vapor phase. The change of evaporation enthalpy can be obtained: ΔHcluster − ΔHp-water = (1 − x)[(−Ucluster-water) − (−Uinterl-water)](20)
The number of hydrogen bonds that are broken due to evaporation of the water cluster is less than that required for the monomer evaporation. Therefore, ΔHcluster − ΔHp-water < 0, the thermodynamic analysis indicate that the presence of water clusters reduces evaporation enthalpy.
Yu et al. fabricated an HNG consisting of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and PPy to achieve an evaporation rate of 3.2 kg m−2 h−1 and evaporation efficiency of 94% via optimizing water transport (1 kW m−2).88 In addition, the presence of the three types of water and the possibility of water clusters in the gel network have been proved by Raman spectroscopy and Li+ ion tracking (Fig. 16d–f). In the past two years, their group has proposed a range of photothermal material-modified hydrogel polymers for vaporization, which achieved an exceptionally high evaporation rate.31,86,87 In 2019, they utilized an in situ polymerization method to fabricate a light-absorbing sponge-like hydrogel (LASH) based on PVA with uniformly distributed Ti2O3 nanoparticles (Fig. 16g).86 When the Ti2O3/PVA weight ratio was 4:30, the LASH exhibited an evaporation rate of 3.6 kg m−2 h−1 (pure water) and a water production rate of 3 kg m−2 h−1 (seawater, air-flow assisted, ca. 40 ml min−1) due to the synergistic energy nanoconfinement reducing heat loss and PVA network lowering vaporization enthalpy (924 ± 104 J g−1) under one sun.
Although the hypothesis of water cluster evaporation still lacks direct experimental evidence, it is an effective method to increase the vaporization rate. In addition, the water clusters have been discovered in other solid phase materials long ago, but the application in SDIE is presently restricted to hydrogel materials.202,203 Therefore, exploiting materials for reducing evaporation enthalpy needs further research.
5.3. Recycling latent heat
In most previous studies of SDIE (if not all), the latent heat released through vapor condensation is usually dissipated to the environment as waste heat. If the internal enthalpy of vapor can be effectively recycled, the rates of vaporization and water yield can be significantly increased. Attempts have been made to use the traditional solar distiller to recycle latent heat of condensation, which requires active components and is likely to contaminate the condensate.204,205 Recently, multi-stage recycling latent heat systems have been proposed that utilized a hydrophobic microporous membrane to separate the vaporization and condensation processes on both sides of the membrane, where the mass transfer occurred only in the vapor phase, thus avoiding contaminating the condensate.206 The vapor pressure gradient and the temperature difference force the vapor to flow downward, and release latent heat on the condenser to produce fresh water and drive the evaporation of the next stage (Fig. 16h).110 The total water production rate (Mtotal) in a multi-stage system can be calculated using the following equation: (21)where ηn is the evaporation efficiency of the nth stage of the recycling latent heat unit. According to eqn (21), Mtotal depends on ηn and the number of recycling stages. Zhou et al. fabricated a two-stage membrane distillation system with a poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) nanofiber network as a hydrophobic membrane and a commercial spectrally selective absorber as a light absorber. It achieved a total water productivity of about 1.02 kg m−2 h−1 and solar efficiency of about 72% (1 kW m−2).30 However, the one-stage system had a total water productivity of only 0.727 kg m−2 h−1 and 51% solar efficiency. In addition, this two-level collector prototype reached a total water productivity of 3.67 kg m−2 d−1 under outdoor conditions. The increase in the number of recycling stages is the most direct and effective way to increase the total water production rate. Asinari et al. fabricated a ten-stage recycling latent heat system to obtain a specific mass flow rate of 2.479 kg m−2 h−1 under a solar intensity of 900 W m−2, which is a 2-fold enhancement compared with the theoretical limit of the vaporization rate (Fig. 16h).110
6. Electricity generation in the process of solar-driven interfacial desalination
Various forms of energy come out inevitably in the process of SDIE, and its multi-effective utilization can not only improve the overall efficiency but also meet various demands. Most regions of freshwater scarcity usually have the problem of electricity shortages. Collecting additional energy from the evaporation process for the electrical energy generation can provide a new opportunity for solving both freshwater and power shortage problems in off-grid and resource-constrained areas.
In 2017, Zhou et al. proposed a device for evaporation-induced electricity generation consisting of carbon black and multiwalled carbon nanotubes which can generate sustained voltages of up to 1 V in the event of evaporation under ambient conditions.207 They claimed that the key to electricity generation was the interaction between water molecules and the carbon layer as well as evaporation-driven water flow in the carbon black sheet. Although this device cannot be used to collect fresh water simultaneously, it provides ideas for the utilization of multi-effect energy in seawater desalination. In the SDIE for desalination, due to rapid vaporization, a significant difference in salinity exists between the water underlying absorber and the bulk water, and such a salinity gradient can also be used for electricity generation. Zhou et al. designed a hybrid system composed of CNT modified filter paper as a photothermal material, commercial Nafion film as the ion selective film and Ag/AgCl electrodes. It simultaneously achieved an evaporation rate of 1.15 kg m−2 h−1 and an output electric power of 1 W m−2 under one sun illumination.32 In addition, it has been proven by experiments that this hybrid system not only utilized the salinity power, but also recycled some of the dissipating heat (Fig. 17a).

The latent heat released through the vapor condensation process can be used for electric energy generation in addition to being recovered by the multi-stage membrane distillation system for improving the water production rate. In 2018, Zhu et al. designed a synergetic coupling device for the simultaneous generation of fresh water and electricity. It introduced high-temperature vapor into an aluminum chamber containing thermoelectric (TE) modules through a thermally insulated tube, and used the temperature difference between the chamber and the room to generate electricity.173 This device achieved an evaporation efficiency of 72.2% with extra electricity (with 1.23% efficiency) generated simultaneously under 30 kW m−2 (Fig. 17b). In order to further utilize waste heat to generate electricity, Ho et al. proposed to utilize a ferroelectric fluoropolymer polyvinylidene fluoride film to obtain a thermomechanical response during the evaporation of nitrogen-enriched carbon sponge. The temperature changes and vaporization-induced thermo-piezoelectric effects coupled to generate the highest output power of 240.7 μW m−2.208 In addition, there is a significant temperature difference between the absorber and the bulk water due to the thermal localization effect, and the triggered Seebeck effect can also be used for electricity generation. In 2019, Ho et al. designed and fabricated a seamlessly integrated system with properties of solar evaporation and waste heat-to-electricity conversion, which consisted of a highly compressible and readily reconfigurable 3D PCC sponge (CNT/cellulose nanocrystal nanocomposite on polydimethylsiloxane sponge) and a TE module (Fig. 17c).33 The 3D PCC foam conformally covered the upper side of the TE module, and the lower side of the TE module was just immersed in the bulk water with the support of the PS foam. Moreover, the TE module, as the thermal barrier, not only caused the temperature difference between the upper and lower ends but also improved the evaporation rate. Under solar radiation of 1 kW m−2, the integrated device had an evaporation rate of 1.36 kg m−2 g−1 and an output power density of 0.4 W m−2.
Apart from the above-mentioned electricity generation techniques, it is also an innovative idea to use the condensed water droplets to generate electricity during sliding friction due to the gravity in the vapor condensation process. In 2018, Ho et al. designed a triboelectric nanogenerator composed of a 3D plasmonic solar absorber gel and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) film.34 Electric signals could be generated due to the electrification of the water and the PTFE when the condensed droplets slid down on the PTFE film (Fig. 17d). The sliding condensate was gathered in a round bottom vessel similar to a tumbler toy, which could utilize omnidirectional mechanical energy, such as wind energy. As the centroid of the vessel changed, the condensed water interacted with the vessel to generate triboelectricity.
The simultaneous generation of fresh water and electricity has made exciting progress over the past few years, but further research is required to improve the output power. In the future, the use of co-produced electricity in turn to synergistically improve the water production rate is also a direction of effort. Based on this idea, it has been proposed that the introduction of solar cells in seawater desalination can effectively increase the water production rate by using the photo-electro-thermal effect. Qu et al. designed and fabricated an all-graphene hybrid architecture with a solar cell to achieve a high water production rate of 2.01–2.61 kg m−2 h−1 under one sun illumination.83 On the one hand, porous graphene sponge as the photothermal layer localized heat to generate vapor. On the other hand, graphene foil as an electrothermal layer further converted the electrical energy resulting from solar-to-electrical energy conversion by the solar cell into heat energy to generate vapor.
7. Summary and outlook
SDIE for seawater desalination is considered as one of the most promising techniques to address freshwater shortages owing to its sustainability, high efficiency, low cost and easy operation. In this review, we mainly divide the process of solar-driven interfacial desalination into three parts to discuss it from the perspective of energy flow: (1) light-to-heat conversion. Three photothermal conversion mechanisms of photothermal materials and the regulation methods for achieving efficient light absorption are mainly discussed. (2) Heat-to-vapor conversion. The principle of three heat loss channels and management methods based on intrinsic and extrinsic strategies are discussed. In addition, three water supply designs commonly used in the field are summarized, and we theoretically analyze the salt deposition as well as summarizing the four salt-rejection methods in combination with the progress in state-of-the-art research. (3) Vapor condensation. The influence of the vapor condensation process on the water production rate of the system is analyzed, and the methods of improving the condensation efficiency are summarized. In addition, we discuss three methods to improve the evaporation rate above the theoretical limit. Finally, the principle and latest developments of additional energy for electricity generation in the solar-driven interfacial desalination process are reviewed.
Over the past five years, remarkable progress in the field of SDIE has been achieved through the concerted efforts of global researchers, including the development of materials and systems, the improvement of evaporation efficiency/rate and the water production rate. However, there are still a number of obstacles that we should overcome.
(1) Establishing standardized measurement techniques and associated efficiency/rate calculations. There have been no uniform and clear experimental parameters and calculation details in previous reports, making it hard to assess and compare them, especially for distinct systems (open systems, semi-closed systems and closed systems).
(2) The development of mass produced, highly efficient, stable, environmentally friendly, and low-cost SDIE materials. The improvement of evaporation efficiency and rate has been pursued blindly in the preliminary studies of solar-driven evaporation technologies, ignoring the production costs and environmental problems. The current evaporation efficiency and rate are already high enough, and the space for improvement is limited. The next phase of research should pay more attention to the cost and sustainability of the materials.
(3) Improving evaporation efficiency and rate under natural flux. Natural weather changes rapidly in practical applications. Further research is required on how to achieve intelligent regulation of the system to obtain efficient evaporation even under low light or even without solar radiation.
(4) Achieving precise matching between water transport, thermal management and salt resistance. Solar-driven interfacial desalination is a pluralistic process. It is also essential to avoid salt deposition and minimize heat loss in addition to meeting the demand for water supply required for evaporation, which has an optimal operating point and needs further research.
(5) Further research on the desalination treatment of complex seawater. In experiments of conventional seawater desalination, researchers usually simulate the seawater sample with formulated brine. However, the real environment of seawater is not only complex in composition, but also has internal convection, salt corrosion, biological corrosion and electrochemical corrosion.
(6) Increasing the condensation collection rate. The freshwater productivity depends on the evaporation rate and the condensation collection rate. Now the evaporation rate can be raised above the theoretical limit, but the condensation collection technology is slow or even neglected, which seriously restricts the freshwater productivity.
(7) Further research on a centralized solar-driven interfacial desalination device for large-scale application. Currently, research on solar-driven interfacial desalination devices is primarily focused on the portable equipment (reservoir, evaporation generator, condensation cover and collecting basin), and its freshwater production is limited, which makes it difficult to alleviate the large-scale urban water shortage crisis. The establishment of centralized solar-driven interfacial desalination devices along the coast should be the mainstream trend of development in the future. The centralized solar-driven interfacial desalination device is a complex engineering system involving continuous water supply, efficient evaporation, and effective condensation and freshwater collection. Economic viability, yield stability, mechanical stability and chemical stability and so on are necessary.
(8) Further research on the collection and utilization of additional energy in the solar-driven interfacial desalination process. This not only provides a new path to solve the shortage of fossil resources, but can also further “regurgitation-feed” the freshwater production rate.
We believe that the efforts will eventually bridge the gap between state-of-the-art solar desalination and practical applications with the vigorous development of diverse disciplines, and the ideal of quenching the thirst for the whole world will be realized in the future.

 	Fig. 10  Evolution of the water transport structure of SDIE and COMSOL simulation of temperature distribution. Section diagram (upper) and 3D diagram (lower) of heat transfer. SE: self-floating absorber (without any thermal barrier) using its own porous structure for water supply; BI: bifunctional water channel (thermal barrier and water supply); 2D: 2D water channel; 1D: 1D water channel. Note: COMSOL simulation parameters: (1) solar intensity (1 kW m−2); (2) the absorbance of the solar absorber (carbon-based material) is 0.95; (3) the thermal conductivity of the bifunctional water channel is 0.426 W m−1 K−1; the white PS foam with a thermal conductivity of 0.04 W m−1 K−1 acts as a thermal barrier (model of 2D water channel), and the air-laid paper with a thermal conductivity of 0.6 W m−1 K−1 acts as 2D and 1D water channels because it is filled with a lot of water.
