    , Accepted 3rd October 2017First published on 3rd October 2017Abstractπ-Conjugated donor–acceptor (D–A) polymers containing electron withdrawing non-S-oxidized 4H-1,2,6-thiadiazines and electron donating (het)aryl-substituted indacenodithiophenes (IDTs) were prepared and used in organic solar cell (OSC) devices with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the fullerene acceptor. The non-S-oxidized 4H-1,2,6-thiadiazine containing polymers were wide bandgap absorbers (Eoptg 1.80–1.95 eV) with low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital energy levels (EHOMO −5.5 to −6.1 eV) affording high open circuit voltages (Vocs 0.82–0.96 V) for polymer:fullerene bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs. Owing to enhanced short circuit currents (Jscs) and fill factors (FFs), the 1,2,6-thiadiazin-4(H)-one-based polymers had significantly higher performances (up to 3.83%) vs. the N-(perfluorophenyl)-1,2,6-thiadiazin-4(H)-imine based-polymers (up to 1.37%).
1. Introduction
Organic semiconductors can offer unique optical and electronic properties1–3 for use in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs),4 organic field effect transistors (OFETs)5–7 and organic solar cells (OSCs).8–10 Optimising device performance via modification of the organic semi-conductor's chemical structure can be achieved via synthetic organic chemistry, a powerful molecular toolbox, and guided by theory and/or empirical data provided by chemists, physicists and engineers.11 Polymer-based organic semiconductors represent a challenging sub-category, and the control and optimization of their chemical structures for different optoelectronic applications involves many parameters, such as: (i) molecular weight; (ii) bond length alternation; (iii) planarity; (iv) aromatic resonance energy; (v) substitution; and (vi) intermolecular interactions.8,12 Important parameters such as band gap and energy-level alignment of conjugated polymers are manipulated by two main methods: the first relies on the donor–acceptor (D–A) approach and the other relies on the stabilization of the quinoid structure.8,12
The D–A approach is the most common tool for preparing conjugated polymers due to the plethora of functional electron-donating and electron-accepting building blocks. Common electron donating monomers include bridged biphenylenes and bithiophenes, benzodithiophenes, thienothiophenes, benzotrithiophenes, naphthodithiophenes, etc.9,13 Electron acceptors used to construct D–A polymers typically possess at least one or more strong electron withdrawing groups, e.g. sp2-hybridized imine nitrogen, carboxyl or ylidenemalononitrile units, and are often quinoidal in structure.14 Other parameters influencing the optoelectronic properties of polymer-based semiconductors are the side chains whereby the length, degree of branching, substitution and their relative positions on the polymeric backbone can influence the solid-state morphology.15,16 An ongoing OSC challenge is to develop high-performance conjugated polymers as electron-donating or electron-accepting active layer components. Unfortunately, to date, the optimization of their chemical structure remains a complex task owing to the lack of accurate guidelines.17–21
As such, there is a lot of interest in new monomer units for constructing D–A conjugated polymers for use in OSCs. Sulfur-nitrogen (S,N) heterocycles such as benzo-, azino- and thieno-fused 1,2,5-thiadiazoles have been successfully used as electron-withdrawing components of OSC donor materials and led to an improved device performance.22–24 The related S,N-heterocycle that attracted our interest is the non-S-oxidized 4H-1,2,6-thiadiazine 1,25–29 which is formally a ring expanded analogue of 1,2,5-thiadiazole 2 (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Structure of non-S-oxidized 4H-1,2,6-thiadiazine 1 and its charge separated resonance form 1′ together with the structurally similar 1,2,5-thiadiazole 2. IUPAC ring numbering (in red) and the common atoms and bonds between the two heterocycles (in blue) are highlighted. 
Formally, non-S-oxidized 4H-1,2,6-thiadiazines share many common structural features with 1,2,5-thiadiazoles such as five atoms with the same connectivity and planarity, but display only moderate aromaticity (the Bird's aromaticity index for thiadiazinone is IA 5430,31cf. furan IA 5331vs. 1,2,5-thiadiazole IA 10431) and a favourable partially quinoidal orientation of the π electron density. Importantly, non-S-oxidized 4H-1,2,6-thiadiazines are also more electron deficient than 1,2,5-thiadiazoles owing to the distribution of six π electrons over six atoms rather than over five ring atoms in 1,2,5-thiadiazoles.32 Resonance structures, e.g. 1,2,6-thiadiazinium 1′ (Fig. 1), particularly where Q is a strongly electronegative or electron-withdrawing group, support the electron deficient character of non-S-oxidized 4H-1,2,6-thiadiazines. Not surprisingly, 4H-1,2,6-thiadiazines have been proposed as potential radical anion precursors.32
Furthermore, cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies support that appropriately substituted non-S-oxidized 4H-1,2,6-thiadiazines can act as electron-withdrawing components in OSC devices.33 To date, only one report of a BHJ-OSC device based on the non-S-oxidized 4H-1,2,6-thiadiazine 3, a small molecule D–A–D donor, with the [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) acceptor has given a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.7%.34 Interestingly, no polymers based on this S,N-heterocycle have been reported, despite proposals by both Woodward35 and Rees36–38 that π-conjugated polymers of non-S-oxidized 4H-1,2,6-thiadiazine, e.g., polymer 4, could be stable alternatives to the superconductor poly(sulfur nitride) (SN)x (Fig. 2).

Herein, we report the first examples of π-conjugated polymers of non-S-oxidized 4H-1,2,6-thiadiazines for use as D–A polymer components in OSC devices (Fig. 3). Arylated indacenodithiophenes (IDTs), which are favourable electron-rich building blocks for the synthesis of p-type polymers for OPVs39–53 owing to their planarity and good charge carrier mobilities, were used as the electron-donating moieties. Details of optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties were reported.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis
A range of thiadiazine–indacenodithiophene polymers (5–12, Fig. 3) were synthesized containing minor structural variations to enable a correlation between their structure, opto-electronic and OSC properties. 4-n-Hexylphenyl- and 5-n-hexylthien-2-yl-substituted indacenodithiophenes (IDTs) 13 and 14, respectively, were chosen as the electron-donating units, the n-hexyl side chains providing improved solubility and processing properties. Meanwhile, thiadiazinones (Q = O) and N-(perfluorophenyl)thiadiazinimines (Q = NC6F5) were selected as the electron withdrawing moieties, and RB3LYP/6-311G(d) DFT calculations show that 3,5-di(thien-2-yl)-4H-1,2,6-thiadiazin-4-one and N-(perfluorophenyl)-3,5-di(thien-2-yl)-4H-1,2,6-thiadiazin-4-imine have frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) with similar energy levels and bandgaps (Section S2, ESI†); however, the perfluorophenyl group in the latter was expected to positively affect the morphology of the polymers in a manner similar to that reported for fluorinated aryl and alkyl groups.54–56
Specifically, Stille coupling mediated polymerisation57 [Pd2(dba)3 (2 mol %) and P(o-tol)3 (4 mol %) in PhMe at ca. 110 °C for 48 h] was used to combine bis(trimethylstannyl)tetra(n-hexyl)-substituted phenyl-IDT and thien-2-yl-IDTs with readily available 3,5-dichloro-4H-1,2,6-thiadiazin-4-one (15)25 or 3,5-dichloro-N-(perfluorophenyl)-4H-1,2,6-thiadiazin-4-imine (16) to provide polymers 5 and 6 or 7 and 8, respectively (Scheme 1). Similarly, IDTs 13 and 14 were combined with readily available 3,5-bis(5-bromothien-2-yl)-substituted 4H-1,2,6-thiadiazin-4-one 1726 or N-(perfluorophenyl)-4H-1,2,6-thiadiazin-4-imine 18 to provide polymers 9 and 10 or 11 and 12, respectively (Scheme 1).

Crude polymers were purified by successive Soxhlet extraction and were collected by precipitation from the chloroform fraction (Section S1.3, ESI†). The average molecular weights per number (n) and per weight (w) and the polydispersity index (Đ) of the polymers were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) based on monodispersed polystyrene standards at 150 °C with 1,2-dichlorobenzene as an eluent (Table 1 and Fig. 4).

 Fig. 4  GPC profiles of (a) 1,2,6-thiadiazin-4(H)-one-based polymers 5, 6, 9 and 10, and (b) N-(perfluorophenyl)-1,2,6-thiadiazin-4(H)-imine-based polymers 7, 8, 11 and 12. 
The thiadiazinimine-based polymers (Q = NC6F5, 7, 8, 11 and 12) exhibit higher n and w values as compared to thiadiazinone-based polymers (Q = O, 5, 6, 9 and 10). Furthermore, a major difference between the thiadiazinone-based polymers vs. the thiadiazinimine-based polymers was that the former show both high and low molecular weight components while the latter (except polymer 12) afford only one peak that is attributed to a lower molecular weight. Tentatively, the higher molecular weight fraction in polymers 5, 6, 9, 10 and 12 can be attributed to aggregates that did not dissolve at the temperature in which the GPC measurements were performed (150 °C) and did not allow the polymer chains to adopt the coil conformation. Finally, a comparison of the GPC data supports that the non-π-extended (x = 0) polymers 5–8 have a lower Đ, which is attributed to a more controlled polymer chain growth, as compared to π-extended (x = 1) polymers 9–12.
Elemental analysis and NMR spectroscopy supported the chemical structures of polymers 5–12 (Section S3, ESI†). 1H NMR spectra of the polymers showed typically broad resonances, but several notable and characteristic peaks could be readily assigned based on their chemical shifts. These included the IDT H-5/10 signals at δH 8.13–8.06 ppm for the 4-n-hexylphenyl-substituted IDTs and δH 8.38–8.17 ppm for the 5-n-thien-2-yl-substituted IDTs, and the α-methylene protons at δH 2.56–2.58 ppm for the 4-n-hexylphenyl groups and δH 2.71–2.74 ppm for the 5-n-hexylthien-2-yl groups. The remaining signals were more difficult to definitively assign owing to overlapping signals. The desymmetrising influence of perfluorophenylimine stereochemistry can lead to polymer regio-randomness further complicating the spectra cf. the 1H NMR spectrum of the bis(bromothienyl)thiadiazine 18 (ESI,† Fig. S10), which shows four thienyl H resonances indicating a non-symmetric structure. 19F NMR spectroscopy also supported the incorporation of the N-(perfluorophenyl)thiadiazinimines in polymers 7, 8, 11 and 12 (Section S3, ESI†). The ortho-, meta- and para-fluorines of the perfluorophenyl substituent appeared as broad and/or complex peaks in their characteristic chemical shift positions: δF (ortho) −147.6 to −145.8 ppm, δF (meta) −162.7 to −161.4 ppm, and δF (para) −160.0 to −159.8 ppm. In contrast, the fluorine chemical shifts in monomers 16–18 showed well-defined splitting (Fig. S6, S9 and S12, ESI†).
The thermal stability of polymers 5–12 was assessed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements (Section S4, ESI†). Interestingly, all polymers were thermally stable up to 270 °C and some noticeable trends were observed: (i) the phenyl-IDT containing polymers (5, 7, 9 and 11) were more thermally stable than their respective thien-2-yl-IDT containing analogues (6, 8, 10 and 12) with the differences ranging between 4.2 and 19.1 °C; (ii) the thiadiazinones (5, 6, 9 and 10) were less thermally stable than their respective thiadiazinimine analogues (7, 8, 11 and 12) with the differences in the 1st decomposition onset temperatures of ca. 100 °C; and finally, (iii) increasing the conjugation of the polymers by incorporating extra thien-2,5-yl moieties had a negligible effect on thermal stability.
2.2. Optical and electrochemical properties
The absorption spectra of polymers 5–12 in chloroform (Fig. 5a and b) and their optoelectronic characteristics (Table 2) indicated that the non-π-extended analogues 5–8 (x = 0) qualitatively displayed a similar spectral shape with two well-resolved vibronic features (Fig. 5a). Meanwhile, the thien-2,5-yl π-extended (x = 1) polymers 9–12 gave similar but broader absorption spectra with less resolved vibronic features (Fig. 5b). In general, the absorption peak maxima of both the high- and low-energy transitions of the thiadiazinone-based copolymers 5/6 (Q = O, x = 0) and 9/10 (Q = O, x = 1) are red-shifted with respect to their analogous thiadiazinimine-based copolymers 7/8 (Q = NC6F5, x = 0) and 11/12 (Q = NC6F5, x = 1), regardless of the nature of the IDT aryl substitution (i.e. R = 4-n-hexylphenyl vs. 5-n-hexylthien-2-yl) (Table 2). Furthermore, the absorption peak maxima of the 4-n-hexylphenyl-substituted IDT polymers 5/7 (x = 0, R = 4-n-hexylphenyl) and 9/11 (x = 0, R = 4-n-hexylphenyl) are red shifted with respect to the analogous 5-n-hexylthien-2-yl-substituted IDT polymers 6/8 (x = 0, R = 5-n-hexylthien-2-yl) and 10/12 (x = 1, R = 5-n-hexylthien-2-yl) regardless of the nature of the thiadiazine (i.e. Q = O vs. NC6F5) (Table 2).

In the solid state (Fig. 5c and d), both the low and high wavelength absorption peaks of polymers 5–12 are red shifted with respect to their solution spectra, except polymers 7 and 9 (Table 2). This supports the efficient π–π stacking of the polymer chains passing from solution to the solid state for 5, 6, 8 and 10–12. The optical bandgaps of polymers 5–12 (Eoptg 1.80–1.95 eV) (Table 2) support that these copolymers are potential wide bandgap semiconductors. The thiadiazinone-based polymers 5 and 6 (x = 0) and N-(perfluorophenyl)-1,2,6-thiadiazin-4(H)-imine based-polymers 7 and 8 (x = 0) have similar optical bandgaps [Eoptg(5) 1.85 eV vs. Eoptg(6) 1.87 eV] and [Eoptg(7) 1.93 eV vs. Eoptg(8) 1.95 eV], indicating that the aryl substituent of IDT did not affect significantly the Eoptg. In contrast, varying the electron withdrawing units, i.e. thiadiazinone (Q = O) vs. thiadiazinimine (Q = NC6F5), led to a meaningful change in the optical band gap irrespective of whether a thien-2,5-yl spacer was present (x = 0 or 1), e.g., Eoptg(6) 1.87 eV vs. Eoptg(8) 1.95 eV and Eoptg(10) 1.80 eV vs. Eoptg(12) 1.92 eV, supporting lower optical band gaps when the more electron withdrawing thiadiazinone moiety was present (Table 2). Finally, the impact of thien-2,5-diyl π-linkages in the polymer backbone was examined (x = 0 vs. 1). In the thiadiazinone-based polymers 9 and 10 (x = 1), the insertion of thien-2,5-diyl π-linkages in the polymer backbone reduced the Eoptg by 0.03 eV and 0.07 eV vs. the thiadiazinone-based polymers 5 and 6 (x = 0), respectively (Table 2). A similar observation is detected for the thiadiazinimine-based polymers 7 and 8, and 11 and 12. In the thiadiazinimine-based polymers 11 and 12 (x = 1), the insertion of thien-2,5-diyl π-linkages in the polymer backbone reduced the Eoptg by 0.06 eV and 0.03 eV vs. the thiadiazinimine-based polymers 5 and 6 (x = 0), respectively.
To estimate the energy levels and the electrochemical bandgap (ECVg) of polymers 5–12, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to identify the oxidation and reduction potentials (Table 2 and Section S5, ESI†). In general, all of the polymers 5–12 exhibit irreversible reduction peaks (Fig. S33a, ESI†), but the non-π-extended (x = 0) polymers 5–8 showed irreversible oxidation peaks, while the π-extended (x = 1) polymers 9–12 showed reversible oxidation peaks (Fig. S33b, ESI†). A schematic illustration of the energy levels of polymers 5–12 (Fig. 6) highlights that between the pairs of 5/6, 7/8, 9/10 and 11/12 the 5-n-hexylthien-2-yl-substitution on IDT affords lower EHOMO levels than the 4-n-hexylphenyl-substituted IDT analogues, which is unexpected as thien-2-yls are typically stronger mesomeric electron donors than phenyl groups.58 A tentative explanation for the lower EHOMO levels can be attributed to steric constraints that prevent the planarity of the (het)aryl substituents leading to a low mesomeric effect and more prominent σ-inductive effect of the thienyl side groups.59 Similar observations have recently been reported with small-molecule non-fullerene acceptors consisting of phenyl- and thienyl-substituted indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene building blocks.60 Moreover, polymers 9–12 reveal ELUMO levels in the range of −3.9 to −4.1 eV, which are typically lower than those of polymers 5, 7 and 8 (Fig. 6). Polymer 6 is an exception and exhibits a low-lying ELUMO (−4.24 eV) and EHOMO (−6.02 eV), leading to a relatively low ECVg of 1.78 eV. Finally, while in polymers 5–8, the thiadiazinone-based polymers 5 and 6 present a lower ECVg than the thiadiazinimine-based polymers 7 and 8, in polymers 9–12 the opposite trend is observed (Table 2).

2.3. Photovoltaic and charge carrier transport properties
The photovoltaic performance of the 5–12:PC71BM systems was investigated by fabricating OSCs in an inverted device architecture of ITO/zinc oxide (ZnO)/polyethylenimine (PEI)/polymer:PC71BM (1:1.5 w/w)/molybdenum oxide (MoO3)/silver (Ag). The current density vs. voltage (J–V) and the IPCE curves are presented in Section S6, Fig. S34 (ESI†). From the data extracted (Table 3), several correlations between structures and OPV performance were observed.

All devices had comparably high (0.82 to 0.96 V) open circuit voltages (Vocs) for polymer:fullerene BHJ-OSCs, which was attributed to the D–A copolymer's deep lying EHOMO levels vs. vacuum (−5.57 to −6.10 eV, Fig. 6). Nevertheless, variations within the observed Vocs did not directly correlate with variations of the EHOMO levels of the polymers based on the empirical equation predicting the Voc.61–63 Tentatively, this was attributed to charge transfer states (CTs),64–66 which can form at the interface between an electron donor polymer (in our case, polymers 5–12) and the electron acceptor fullerene derivative (PC71BM in this work), being generated at different energy level positions in each polymer:PC71BM system.
Furthermore, all the devices suffered from low fill factors (FFs 0.26–0.53) which limited the performance of the OSCs; interestingly, the most promising polymer 9 had by far the highest FF of 0.53. In general, the 9–12:PC71BM systems exhibited on average higher PCEs (0.77–3.57%, average 1.87%) than the corresponding 5–8:PC71BM systems (0.38–0.79%, average 0.59%), which we attribute to their increased short circuit currents (Jscs(9–12) 3.20–7.82 mA cm−2vs. Jscs(5–8) 1.14–2.91 mA cm−2). The higher Jscs(9–12) vs. Jscs(5–8) are in agreement with the observations of Da Como et al.67 and Chochos et al.,68 where D–A polymer semiconductors with closely spaced D and A moieties suffer from fast recombination owing to the close average separation of the correlated geminate pairs; this highlights the beneficial role of more π-extended structures, e.g., those containing thien-2,5-diyl as π-linkers (x = 1, Fig. 3), in increasing the recombination lifetime.
The highest PCE among the studied polymers was 3.57% for 9:PC71BM (Voc = 0.86 V, Jsc = 7.82 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.53), while a lower PCE (1.76%) was obtained for 10:PC71BM (Voc = 0.95 V, Jsc = 5.29 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.35). The PCEs of both were further improved by adjusting the processing conditions: increasing the speed of the spin coater from 1000 to 2000 rpm for 9:PC71BM increased the PCE to 3.83% (Voc = 0.91 V, Jsc = 9.39 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.45), while increasing the content of PC71BM from 1.5 to 2 w/w in 10:PC71BM increased the PCE to 3.24% (Voc = 0.95 V, Jsc = 8.51 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.40) (Fig. 7).

We continued our analysis by investigating the charge transport properties of the polymer:PC71BM blend films utilizing the space charge limited current (SCLC) model. For each system, unipolar devices were fabricated and their dark J–V characteristics were recorded (Fig. 8). The charge transport characterization of all devices is summarised in Table 3.

Generally, polymers 5–12 displayed hole mobilities (μh) of ∼10−6 to 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 which are typically lower than those reported for typical high-PCE BHJ films69,70 (Table 3). There was an overall improvement in hole mobility when the thien-2,5-diyl π-linkages were incorporated into the polymers: cf. polymers 5–8 (x = 0) μh 1.3 × 10−6 to 1.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1vs. polymers 9–12 (x = 1) μh 1.3 × 10−5 to 1.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1. Furthermore, hole mobilities in all but one case improved when the IDT side chain was changed from 4-n-hexylphenyl to 5-n-hexylthien-2-yl: cf. μh(7) 8.5 × 10−6vs. μh(8) 1.3 × 10−6 cm2 V−1, μh (9) 1.3 × 10−5vs. μh (10) 1.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 and μh (11) 3.5 × 10−5vs. μh (12) 1.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1; it is unclear why this trend was not observed between polymers 5 and 6. Finally, thiadiazinone polymers 5 and 6 (Q = O, x = 0), without the thien-2,5-diyl π-linkages, had noticeably higher hole mobilities than their thiadiazinimine analogues 7 and 8 (Q = NC6F5, x = 0) (μh 1.0 × 10−4 and 5.2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1vs. 8.5 × 10−6 and 1.3 × 10−6 cm2 V−1, respectively); however, this noticeable difference in behaviour was not observed for the analogous thien-2,5-diyl π-extended analogues 9–12.
The data supported that hole mobilities improved when thiophenes were included either as π spacers or as substituents on IDT. Since in SCLC the mobility of the charge carriers is measured perpendicular to the substrate,71 we tentatively consider that as the conjugation path increased on inclusion of the thien-2,5-diyl π-linkages in polymers 9–12 this improved their inherent ability to self-assemble via face-to-face π interactions. Similarly, replacing the n-hexylphenyl IDT side chain by the less sterically demanding 5-n-hexylthien-2-yl, which can participate in interchain S⋯S contacts, also aided self-assembly. Nevertheless, the orientation of the polymer chains when blended with PC71BM remains unclear. In the future, advanced crystallographic techniques like two-dimensional grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering and grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering can be used to understand how the polymer chains self-assemble and pack either as pristine films or in blends with the PC71BM.
Finally, while the hole mobility of the 9:PC71BM device was one order of magnitude lower than that of the 10:PC71BM device (Table 3), it presented higher Jsc and FF, and the corresponding PCE. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies on the 9:PC71BM and 10:PC71BM devices revealed similar morphological features (Fig. 9), which did not explain the increased Jsc and the FF of the 9:PC71BM device.

Tentatively, since the molecular weight and morphological deviations between polymers 9 and 10 can be excluded for the observed differences on the Jsc and FF, we propose that charge carriers formed during photoexcitation in the 9:PC71BM and 10:PC71BM devices may be recombining through other energy pathways, e.g., CT states, as mentioned above. In particular, for the 10:PC71BM device, these energetic pathways could be preventing the efficient charge separation and collection to the representative electrodes and influencing the charge recombination. Systematic advanced spectroscopic studies will be needed to elucidate the charge separation and extraction mechanisms in these polymer:PC71BM devices.
3. Conclusion
A series of D–A conjugated polymers based on 1,2,6-thiadiazin-4(H)-one or N-(perfluorophenyl)-4H-1,2,6-thiadiazin-4-imine as the acceptor moieties and (het)aryl-functionalized IDT derivatives as the donor units were prepared via Pd(0)-catalysed Stille cross-coupling polymerization. Correlations were made between the chemical structures, optoelectronic properties and organic solar cell performances of the polymers: combining 1,2,6-thiadiazin-4(H)-one or N-(perfluorophenyl)-4H-1,2,6-thiadiazin-4-imine in the polymer backbone gave wide bandgap semiconducting polymers (Eoptg 1.80–1.95 eV) with low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO) energy levels (−5.5 to −6.1 eV), which resulted in high Vocs (0.82 to 0.96 V) in OSCs. Furthermore, thien-2,5-diyl π-extended 1,2,6-thiadiazin-4(H)-one-based polymers 9 and 10 exhibited noticeably higher performances (PCEs 3.2–3.8%) in BHJ solar cells when combined with PC71BM than those of the analogous N-(perfluorophenyl)-4H-1,2,6-thiadiazin-4-imine-based polymers 11 and 12 (PCEs 0.77–1.37%), or the less π-extended related structures 5–8 (PCEs 0.38–0.79%) due to the enhanced Jscs and FFs. These results pave the way for further development of alternative electron donor materials for OSCs based on semiconducting non-S-oxidized 4H-1,2,6-thiadiazine polymers.
