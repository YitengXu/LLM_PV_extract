    , Accepted 22nd January 2013First published on 23rd January 2013AbstractQuantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) present a promising technology for next generation photovoltaic cells, having exhibited a considerable leap in performance over the last few years. However, recombination processes occurring in parallel at the TiO2–QDs–electrolyte triple junction constitute one of the major limitations for further improvement of QDSSCs. Reaching higher conversion efficiencies necessitates gaining a better understanding of the mechanisms of charge recombination in these kinds of cells; this will essentially lead to the development of new solutions for inhibiting the described losses. In this study we have systematically examined the contribution of each interface formed at the triple junction to the recombination of the solar cell. We show that the recombination of electrons at the TiO2/QDs interface is as important as the recombination from TiO2 and QDs to the electrolyte. By applying conformal MgO coating both above and below the QD surface, recombination rates were significantly reduced, and an improvement of more than 20% in cell efficiency was recorded.
Introduction
Quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs)1–5 have been rapidly evolving over the past few years, resulting in a significant improvement of light to electric power conversion efficiencies of up to about 6%.6–8 The operation of QDSSCs is similar to that of the well-known dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).9–11 Under illumination, photons are absorbed by the sensitizer, which injects excited electrons into the conduction band (CB) of the wide band gap semiconductor electrode while the holes are removed by the redox electrolyte and regenerated at the counter electrode.
Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) such as CdS,12–14 CdSe,13,15,16 PbS,17,18 PbI2,19 InAs,20 HgTe21 and InP22 as well as extremely thin inorganic absorber layers23 have been used as an alternative to dye molecule sensitizers in these cells due to the fact that QDs possess the ability to manipulate their solar spectrum absorption by tuning the particle size and therefore the optical band gap.16 Moreover, the use of QDs opens new possibilities for third-generation solar cell configurations such as multiple exciton generation (MEG).24 However, despite their great potential, the conversion efficiencies of QDSSCs6 are still low compared to those of conventional DSSCs.25 The rather low efficiency of QDSSCs is attributed to the relatively low photovoltage in the cell compared to DSSCs and to the recombination paths induced by the electronic properties of the interfaces formed at the nanoporous TiO2–QD–electrolyte triple junction.26,27 In order to reach higher conversion efficiencies, a way should be found to slow down the recombination processes occurring at the different interfaces of the working electrode.28
We have recently shown that QDs play a major role in the recombination processes occurring in QDSSCs due to the fact that they can store charge in their electronic surface states.29,30 As a result, several important recombination paths are formed at the TiO2–QDs–electrolyte triple junction, including recombination from TiO2 to the electrolyte, from TiO2 to the QDs and from QDs to the electrolyte.
A common route for inhibiting electron recombination from the TiO2 or QDs to the electrolyte in QDSSCs involves the application of surface coatings which act as an energy barrier preventing electrons from recombining.31 Until now, QDSSC photoanodes were usually coated with a thin layer of ZnS,32,33 introduced by the successive ion layer adsorption reaction (SILAR),34 which covers the bare mesoporous TiO2 alongside the surface of QDs toward the electrolyte. The ZnS coating was found to increase all cell parameters due to the passivation of the QD surface states, resulting in strong inhibition of the recombination processes within the cell. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no efficient treatment addressing the recombination path formed at the TiO2/QDs interface. Consequently, there is a need to understand the contribution of each interface to the total recombination of the solar cell and to find a solution that inhibits losses at the untreated TiO2/QDs interface also.
In this study we explored the dominating recombination paths in QDSSCs by isolating the different interfaces of the photoanode with respect to the electrolyte. Between each interface we deposited a thin MgO coating layer from a sol–gel solution using the electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method.35 Due to its wide band gap properties, the MgO layer can act as an energy barrier for preventing recombination losses.36–39 The coating deposition enabled us to monitor and treat each of the recombination pathways formed at the interfaces assembling the photoanode. Our results provide new insights into the role that the different interfaces play in the cell's recombination losses; this understanding is critical for further improvement of the QDSSCs.
Experimental
MgO coating preparation and characterization35
Iodine (28 mg) and acetone (4 ml) were dissolved in 250 ml of ethanol. Using an inert atmosphere glove box, 0.3 g of magnesium ethoxide was placed in a bottle, hermetically sealed and transferred outside the glove box, where under ambient conditions the ethanol solution was added to the bottle under vigorous stirring, after which the solution was cooled in an ice bath. The solution was then sonicated until the magnesium ethoxide was dissolved; then, under vigorous stirring, 2 ml of deionized water was added together with 5 μl of HNO3, and the solution was stirred for 24 h. The resulting solution, which was slightly turbid, was purified by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 5 min. The color of the solution gradually changed from yellow to colorless. The solution was left to age in a closed vessel, without stirring, under ambient conditions for one week before it was used for sol–gel EPD. In a closed vessel under ambient conditions, this solution remained transparent and stable for at least several months. The current density for the deposition in all cases was 10 μA cm−2.
High-resolution transmission electron microscopy – HRTEM (JEOL, JEM-2010 microscope) – was used to determine the uniformity, conformity and thickness of the coating.
Photoelectrode preparation
The transparent conductive oxide (TCO), which is the Fluorine doped Tin Oxide (FTO) used in this study and purchased from Pilkington (8 Ω per square), was cleaned with ethanol and mild soap, thoroughly rinsed with deionized water and dried in a filtered dry air stream. Commercial TiO2 paste (TiO2 Paste DSL, 18NR-AO DYESOL, Australia) was spread using the doctor blade technique, dried and sintered at 450 °C for 30 minutes. The mesoporous film thickness was 10 μm, measured using a profilometer (Surftest SV-500). A seeding layer of CdS was deposited by the SILAR method prior to the CdSe sensitization.34 The TiO2 electrodes were dipped into 0.1 M Cd(ClO4)2 for 1 minute, washed with de-ionized water, immersed into 0.1 M Na2S aqueous solution and washed again. After seeding, chemical bath deposition (CBD) was used to sensitize the electrode with CdSe QDs, following the procedure of Gorer and Hodes.13 Sodium selenosulphate (Na2SeSO3) solution (80 mM) was prepared by dissolving Se powder in a 200 mM Na2SO3 solution (solution A). CdSO4 (80 mM) and trisodium salt of nitrilotriacetic acid (N(CH2COONa)3) (120 mM) were mixed in a volume ratio of 1:1 (solution B) before solutions A and B were mixed in a volume ratio of 1:2. The mesoporous TiO2 electrodes were immersed into the final solution for 24 hours at 10 °C and kept in the dark.
Solar cell characterization
Current–potential (i–V) measurements were performed with an Eco-Chemie Potentiostat at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1, using a sandwich cell configuration. The aqueous polysulfide electrolyte consisting of 1 M sodium sulfide (Na2S), 0.1 M sulfur and 0.1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was used as a redox electrolyte.40,41 To close the circuit, a PbS counter electrode was prepared using the procedure reported elsewhere.42,43 A solar simulator class triple A (newport) calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5 spectrum) served as a light source. The illuminated area of the cell was 1 cm2.
Transient photovoltage (TPV) and charge extraction measurements were performed using a home-built system consisting of an array of white LEDs for bias light and a pulsed red LED for transient measurements. For TPV measurements, the QDSSC was kept under open circuit conditions while the potential was adjusted by the light intensity of the white LEDs. A pulse from the red LED was used to generate a small potential perturbation, recorded by an analog to digital card (National Instruments), while a single exponential decay was fitted to the potential signal using a Labview program. For charge extraction measurements, the bias light was extinguished, and the QDSSC was simultaneously discharged via a 10 Ω resistor. Charge integration was automatically carried out using Labview software.
Results and discussion
The TiO2–QDs–electrolyte triple junction formed at the photoanode in QDSSCs creates several paths for charge recombination, as illustrated in Fig. 1: (a) photo injected electrons from the TiO2 can react with the electrolyte or (b) with the QDs, (c) photo excited electrons from the QDs react with the electrolyte.

In order to check the effect of MgO coating on the recombination processes, 4 photoanodes were fabricated (Fig. 2): first, an electrode with no coating, to serve as a reference (Fig. 2a); second (Fig. 2b), an electrode consisting of MgO coating at the interface between TiO2 particles and CdSe QDs (intermediate); third (Fig. 2c), an electrode with MgO coating over the CdSe QD layer (upper layer), and a fourth electrode (Fig. 2d), with both types of coatings, between the TiO2 and the CdSe QDs covering the CdSe QDs (both layers).

Absorption spectra were taken for all solar cells; revealing similar spectral responses in all cases (see Fig. S1, ESI†). We can thus conclude that the use of MgO coating as an intermediate does not affect the growth of the CdSe QDs on the mesoporous electrode.
The optimal MgO thickness of 2 nm was determined by performance measurements of an electrode series that differed by the coating durations. The results for this comparison are summarized in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Fig. 4 shows current–voltage (i–V) characteristics of QDSSCs measured on optimised MgO coated mesoporous TiO2 films under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). The solar cell parameters are summarized in Table 1. We observe an increase in the short circuit current density (Jsc) when intermediate coating is applied on the mesoporous films prior to CdSe deposition. A similar improvement can be achieved when using the MgO coating following CdSe QD deposition. The strongest photocurrent enhancement is achieved using both coatings (intermediate and upper coatings), from 9.3 to 12.4 mA cm−2. The photovoltage remains nearly unchanged in all 4 electrodes but still in favor of the coated electrodes. As a result, the light to electric power conversion efficiency increases from 2.7% for the reference electrode up to 3.3%. The results presented in Table 1 accord with the results obtained by using incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) measurements; both showing the same trend in using MgO coating as a recombination inhibitor thereby gaining higher photocurrents compared to the reference electrode (see Fig. S3, ESI†).

It is clearly seen that the application of MgO coating at the intermediate and upper layers results in a similar improvement in photocurrents, while using both coatings yields the highest solar cell efficiency. All measurements were taken under one sun illumination at an active area of 1 cm2.

It is noteworthy that the current gained by adding the intermediate coating is similar to that obtained by the upper coated electrode. We can also see that the difference in the measured current between the electrode with both coatings and the reference is approximately the sum of current addition of the two types of coated electrodes. Thus, one cannot underestimate the importance of both TiO2/QDs and QDs/electrolyte interfaces in the recombination process.
To clarify the role of the MgO coating, we performed transient photovoltage (TPV) and charge extraction measurements.11,30,44 Charge extraction is a technique that measures the charge and electron density in the photoactive electrode as a function of the steady state open circuit photovoltage. Fig. 5a shows the electron density as a function of the photovoltages. The plot is divided into two sections: for photovoltages below 0.51 V, the reference electrode possesses the highest electron density per given photovoltage, while for photovoltages above 0.51 V all coated electrodes exhibit higher electron densities per given photovoltage compared to the reference electrode. In addition, we notice that the slopes of all coated electrode curves are larger than that of the reference electrode. Consequently, the difference between the charge accumulations per given photovoltage results from a broadening of the electronic density of states (DOS)45 combined with a possible shift of the TiO2/QD energy bands. We have previously shown that the inhibition of recombination processes attributed to the QDs enabled us to observe QDs' contribution to the total density of states of the TiO2–QD system.29 Thus, the DOS broadening for all coated electrodes could be ascribed to the addition of QDs to the system's DOS, implying that the application of MgO coating at the different interfaces inhibits recombination and improves cell's performance.
 Fig. 5  Comparison of MgO coated and uncoated QDSSCs based on: (a) the number of extracted electrons as a function of the photovoltage, showing the contribution of the QDs to the system's total density of states (DOS) as a result of recombination inhibition by the MgO coatings, (b) electron lifetime as a function of the photovoltage, providing additional evidence that MgO coatings reduce recombination rates at the different interfaces of the photoanode. 
In order to further understand the effect of MgO coating on recombination kinetics at the different working electrode interfaces, an additional analysis of the QDSSC coated electrodes is provided by TPV measurements. TPV is frequently used to reveal the electron lifetimes (τ) in solar cells. Fig. 5b shows a plot of electron lifetime (τ) against photovoltage, revealing significant differences between the untreated reference electrode and the MgO coated electrodes; this directly confirms that MgO coating acts as an efficient recombination blocker. The longest electron lifetime is recorded when using the electrode with both coatings, followed by the electrodes with the upper and intermediate coatings, while the reference cell exhibits the shortest lifetime. This result is in excellent agreement with the measured photocurrents of the different cells, providing another explanation for the higher photocurrents obtained for the coated electrodes compared to the reference electrode. Although it is also common to plot the electron lifetime against charge density, in this case the observed change in the electrodes' DOS rules out the possibility of comparing between the coated electrodes and the reference electrode.
In summary, this work demonstrates the importance of controlling the electronic properties at the TiO2–QDs–electrolyte triple junction. We have shown that by applying a thin MgO coating at the TiO2/QDs intermediate interface, we can reduce the recombination of electrons from the TiO2 to the QDs, which proved to be as beneficial as the standard coating at the interface between the QDs and the electrolyte. Furthermore, coating the electrodes with both types of coatings enables us to benefit from the advantages of each of the two coatings while improving the conversion efficiency of the cell by more than 20%.
Conclusion
In this work, we have demonstrated that a coating layer of MgO preceding and/or following QD deposition is essential for decreasing recombination from the TiO2 and from the QDs to the electrolyte and from TiO2 to the QDs. Electrical characterization methods, such as i–V, IPCE, charge extraction and TPV measurements, reveal that the interface between TiO2 and QDs is equally important for the recombination process as are the other interfaces in the TiO2–QDs–electrolyte triple junction in CdSe sensitized solar cells. More than a 20% improvement in cell efficiency was achieved when using the MgO coating layer prior and after QD deposition. These new understandings on the different recombination losses in QDSSCs should promote the development of new optimization paths toward the fabrication of highly efficient, low-cost QDSSCs.

i–V characteristics of the three different types of MgO coated QDSSC electrodes. Both (red), the upper layer (green), an intermediate (blue), along with a reference electrode (black). It is clearly seen that the application of MgO coating at the intermediate and upper layers results in a similar improvement in photocurrents, while using both coatings yields the highest solar cell efficiency. All measurements were taken under one sun illumination at an active area of 1 cm2.

 	Fig. 5  Comparison of MgO coated and uncoated QDSSCs based on: (a) the number of extracted electrons as a function of the photovoltage, showing the contribution of the QDs to the system's total density of states (DOS) as a result of recombination inhibition by the MgO coatings, (b) electron lifetime as a function of the photovoltage, providing additional evidence that MgO coatings reduce recombination rates at the different interfaces of the photoanode.
