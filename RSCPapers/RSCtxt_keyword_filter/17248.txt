The as-synthesized CdS nanoparticles can be well re-dispersed in toluene to form a uniform and stable CdS ink. On this basis, a CdS electron-selective contact layer can be directly prepared by spin-coating CdS ink and without a further annealing process. The CdS electron-selective contact layer has high optical transmittance at visible wavelengths. Its electron extraction and transfer properties are also investigated using current density–voltage curves, incident photocurrent conversion efficiency, stabilized current density and photoluminescence spectra. The use of a CdS electron-selective contact layer in a planar perovskite solar cell equipped with a Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 light-absorption layer results in a high power conversion efficiency of 16.5%.
1. Introduction
Organometal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have drawn extensive attention due to their high efficiency in generating electricity from sunlight.1–4 In the past eight years, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has increased from 3.8%5 to 22.1%.6 Typically, a PSC includes five components, a conductive substrate, an electron-selective layer (ESL), an organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite light-absorption layer, a hole-transporting layer and a metal top electrode.7 An appropriate ESL not only helps to transport electron, but also serves the purpose of suppressing charge recombination. Currently, in a regular architecture of a PSC, the most widely used inorganic electron-selective material (ESM) is TiO2.8,9 Conventional TiO2 ESLs are usually obtained by sintering a precursor solution at 450 °C or 500 °C. This procedure not only increases manufacturing costs, but also restricts the applications of flexible plastic substrates. Therefore, other alternative inorganic ESMs for PSCs have been developed, such as ZnO,10,11 SnO2,12,13 Fe2O3,14 In2S3,15 WOx,16 CdS,17–25 ZnS,26 and CdSe.27 Later on, a few ternary metal oxides: BaSnO3,28,29 SrTiO3,30 Zn2SnO4,31,32 Nb:SnO2,33 W(Nb)Ox,16etc., were also investigated as ESMs in PSCs.
In this work, CdS is adopted as an ESM in PSCs. CdS is a direct-gap semiconductor. It possesses good merits: high electron conductivity, superior electron transport ability and an appropriate conduction band level, which makes CdS a potentially effective ESM. In 2014, E. J. Juarez-Perez et al. adopted compact CdS as the ESL of a PSC device for the first time.17 They fabricated the CdS ESL using a sputtering method and achieved a PCE of 1.53%. In 2016, I. Hwang et al. prepared a CdS ESL by thermal evaporation and achieved an optimized PCE of 12.2%.20 Usually, most of the time, CdS ESLs are fabricated by direct deposition using a chemical bath or hydrothermal growth method. In 2016, H. Peng et al. prepared a CdS ESL by chemical bath deposition under low temperature and they achieved a high PCE of 16.1%.22Table 1 lists the preparation methods and morphologies of CdS ESMs, and the corresponding device PCEs.

Current




In this study, a CdS ESL was prepared by spin-coating a home-made CdS toluene solution. Using the as-prepared CdS ESL, equipped with a Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 light-absorption layer, the PSC device based on the optimized CdS ESL exhibited a PCE of 16.5%, which is higher than those of the PSCs based on CdS ESLs using other preparation methods. Compared with conventional TiO2 ESLs, the spin-coated CdS ESL doesn't need any further high temperature sintering process or high temperature drying process, making the CdS ESL compatible for flexible PSCs. On the other hand, compared with other preparation methods of CdS ESLs, spin-coating redispersable CdS nanoparticles with an annealing-free process will greatly simplify the assembly process of a PSC device.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Synthesis of CdS nanoparticles
The CdS nanoparticles were synthesized using a solvothermal method. In brief, 0.6 g NaOH was dissolved in a mixed solution of 10 mL deionized water and 30 mL absolute ethyl alcohol. Then 6 mL oleic acid was added in dropwise under magnetic stirring. After the solution was stirred for about 10 min, 10 mL CdCl2·2.5H2O aqueous solution (0.1 M) was added in. 5 min later, 10 mL Na2S·9H2O aqueous solution (0.1 M) was added in. After being stirred for another 10 min, the solution was transferred to a 100 mL autoclave and reacted at 180 °C for 12 h. After being cooled down to room temperature, the yellow precipitate was collected by centrifuging and thoroughly washed three times with absolute ethyl alcohol. Finally, the wet product was directly dispersed in 20 mL toluene to form CdS ink.
2.2. Fabrication of PSCs
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates were etched using a laser etching machine. After that the etched FTO glass substrates were successively cleaned with detergent, deionized water and absolute ethyl alcohol. The FTO substrates were treated with an ultraviolet and ozone processor for 30 min. The CdS ESLs were prepared by spin-coating CdS ink at different speeds via a one-step spin-coating process. The spin-coating speed was controlled at 2000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 rpm, respectively. And the acceleration speed was half of the corresponding spin-coating speed. The relevant CdS ESLs were simply denoted as CdS-x (x was spin-coating speed). The advantage of this CdS ESL preparation method is that it is annealing-free. Before depositing a perovskite light-absorption layer, the CdS ESL was treated with oxygen plasma for 5 min. The precursor solution for the Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 light-absorption layer was 163.4 mg FAI, 481.7 mg PbI2, 21.3 mg MABr, 76.7 mg PbBr2 and 50 μL CsI (1.5 M in DMSO) dissolved in 950 μL of a mixed solution of anhydrous DMF and DMSO (The volume ratio was 4:1).34 The precursor solution was stirred at room temperature for 3 h and then spin-coated onto the CdS ESL via a consecutive two-step process at 1000 and 6000 rpm for 10 and 20 s, respectively. During the high speed step, 140 μL chlorobenzene was dropped onto the substrate at 15 s. The substrates were then annealed at 100 °C for 40 min. The hole-selective contact material was spiro-OMeTAD. The spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg spiro-OMeTAD in 1 mL chlorobenzene with addition of 17.5 μL Li-TFSI solution (520 mg in 1 mL acetonitrile) and 28.8 μL t-BP. The spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin-coated on the perovskite light-absorption layer at 4000 rpm for 20 s. After that, they were kept in a desiccator for 12 h. Finally, 90 nm gold electrodes were deposited with a thermal evaporator.
2.3. Characterization and measurements
The crystal structures of the as-synthesized powder were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Cu Kα radiation, SmartLab 3 kW, Rigaku, Japan). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out on a Thermo Fisher Scientific. The morphologies of CdS were observed by field emission transmission electron microscopy (FETEM) (Tecnai G2 F20) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (SU8010, HITACHI). The sectional view of CdS films on FTO were measured by FESEM (Quanta FEG 250). The optical transmittance of the CdS film on the FTO substrate was conducted by UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometer (Lambda950, PE). The current–voltage (J–V) characteristic curves were examined using a Keithley 2400 source meter. The illumination of AM1.5G simulated solar light was provided by an AAA solar simulator (Newport-94043A) which was equipped with a Xe lamp (450 W) and an AM1.5G filter. The light intensity was adjusted with a reference Si solar cell (Oriel-91150). The effective area of the cell was about 0.13 cm2. The devices were measured by reverse (2.0 to −0.1 V) and forward (−0.1 to 2.0 V) voltage scanning and 100 data points were measured in this scope. The pre-sweep delay time was 40 ms and the dwell time at each voltage step was 30 ms. The incident photocurrent conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum was measured by an IPCE measurement system (Newport, USA). The stabilized current density was measured on a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation. Steady-state photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) measurements were recorded using a Thermo scientific lumina flourescence spectrometer instrument (LF-1303003). Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were acquired with an OmniFluo-TRPL510HQ from ZOLIX INSTRUMENTS CO. LTD.
3. Results and discussion
The compositions and crystal phase of the as-synthesized product were investigated by XRD. The XRD pattern in Fig. 1(a) shows that the product has a good crystallinity and is mainly composed of cubic CdS because the main diffraction peaks are matched well with PDF #10-0454. Three strong diffraction peaks located at 26.4, 43.8 and 51.9° can be well indexed to the crystal planes of (1 1 1), (2 2 0) and (3 1 1). Fig. 1(b) shows the XRD patterns of perovskite films on the CdS ESLs and blank FTO substrate. Compared with the XRD pattern of the perovskite film on a blank FTO substrate, there is no evident secondary phase in the XRD patterns of the perovskite films on the CdS ESLs. In a previous report, Dunlap-Shohl et al. found that CdS could react with MAI to form a new phase (CH3NH3)2CdI4 and it is not good for device performance.21 However, the result of Fig. 1(b) shows that the annealing-free CdS ESLs are very stable and don’t have a significant influence on the crystallization of the perovskite layer. Furthermore, XPS measurements of perovskite layers on the CdS-6000 ESL and the FTO substrate were conducted to confirm this conjecture. The results are shown in Fig. 1(c–f).

According to the survey spectra in Fig. 1(c), the two samples are mainly composed of Cs, I, N, C, Pb and Br, and there is no obvious presence of Cd in the sample of the perovskite layer on the CdS-6000 ESL. Given that the signature of the harmful phase is the presence of a Cd–I bond, we focus on the analysis of I 3d. As shown in Fig. 1(f), the I 3d peak observed in the sample of the perovskite layer on the CdS-6000 ESL does not display any shift in the binding energy with respect to the sample of perovskite layer directly deposited on the FTO substrate, indicating that all iodine atoms in the perovskite layer deposited on the CdS-6000 ESL are surrounded by a uniform chemical environment and there is no obvious presence of the Cd–I bond. This result also implies that the annealing-free CdS ESLs are very stable and they don't have a significant influence on the crystallization of the perovskite layer.
The morphology of CdS was observed by FETEM. The FETEM image in Fig. 2(a) shows that CdS exhibits an irregular particle shape. The diameters of small particles will be less than 5 nm while the diameters of large particles will be over 10 nm. A lot of particles will agglomerate. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern in Fig. 2(b) shows the presence of distinct diffraction rings, confirming that CdS nanoparticles are well-crystallized. What's more, the SAED pattern also reveals that the CdS nanoparticles have a polycrystalline structure. Commonly, a single crystal has a relatively regular appearance while a polycrystalline structure does not. This also explains to a certain extent, why the CdS nanoparticles prepared in this experiment don't have a regular appearance.

Fig. 2(d)–(g) displays top-view FESEM images of CdS films on FTO. For comparison, Fig. 2(c) gives the top-view FESEM image of the blank FTO substrate and the blank FTO layer is scalelike. As shown in Fig. 2(d), when CdS solution is spin-coated on the FTO substrate at 2000 rpm, the resulting CdS film cannot be well-covered on the FTO substrate. This will result in the direct contact of the perovskite light-absorption layer with the FTO substrate, bringing about short circuit. By contrast, the CdS films cover the FTO substrate better when the spin-coating speed is controlled at 6000 or 8000 rpm. The thickness of the CdS films on FTO was measured by sectional view FESEM and the corresponding FESEM images are inserted in Fig. 2. The thickness of the CdS films on FTO has much to do with the spin-coating speed. The thicknesses of the CdS films are about 168, 123, 116, and 104 nm for CdS-2000, CdS-4000, CdS-6000, and CdS-8000, respectively. Fig. 2(h) is a photograph of CdS nanoparticles dispersed in toluene. It shows that CdS nanoparticles can be well re-dispersed in toluene and form a uniform yellow solution.

Fig. 3 gives the optical transmittance spectra of CdS nanoparticles spin-coated on the FTO substrate with different spin-coating speeds. After being covered with CdS nanoparticles, the optical transmittance remains over 79% in the range from 520 to 800 nm, while it shows a slight decrease in the wavelength range of 350–520 nm. However, as a whole, these four kinds of CdS films all exhibit superior transmittance in the range of visible light. The results of the optical transmittance spectra indicate that the majority of sunlight can penetrate through the CdS films to the perovskite light-absorption layer to produce photon-generated carriers.

Fig. 4 displays the J–V curves of planar devices with CdS ESLs measured under AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. From Fig. 4, after optimization, the device assembled with the CdS ESL gives a superior photovoltaic performance with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.5%, short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 21.58 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.092 V, and fill factor (FF) of 0.700 when the spin-coating speed was controlled at 6000 rpm and measured under reverse scan. Meanwhile, the other three PSC devices acquire PCE values of 13.76%, 14.49% and 15.89%, respectively, when measured in the same situation. It is clear that a lower spin-coating speed cannot give a satisfactory photovoltaic performance, possibly due to the unsatisfactory coverage of the CdS films on the FTO substrate, causing the direct contact of the FTO and perovskite, resulting in short circuit. Moreover, the J–V curves were also measured in the forward scan direction. Under this circumstance, the devices with CdS ESLs obtained PCE values of 9.61%, 10.16%, 12.01% and 11.44%, respectively.

The IPCE and stabilized current density of the optimized PSC device with CdS-6000 ESL were determined. The results are shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b). As shown in Fig. 5(a), the IPCE curve of the PSC device with CdS-6000 ESL shows an outstanding photo-response from 360 to 750 nm, indicating that photo-generated carriers can be effectively collected by the CdS ESL. Besides, the integrated current density is 18.54 mA cm−2 which is close to the measured value from a photovoltaic performance test. Fig. 5(b) shows the stabilized current density and it was measured at a maximum power point (0.85 V). According to Fig. 5(b), this PSC device achieves a constant current density of 18.72 mA cm−2 within 400 s, leading to a steady-state PCE of 15.91%. The favorable steady-state output suggests that the CdS-6000 film is an ideal ESL.

The electron extraction and transporting properties were further investigated by steady-state PL spectra and TRPL spectra. Fig. 6(a) displays the steady-state PL spectra of perovskite films on the CdS ESLs and the blank FTO substrate. It is quite clear that the PL intensity shows a considerably obvious quenching when the perovskite films are deposited on the CdS ESLs, suggesting efficient charge separation between the perovskite light-absorption layer and CdS ESLs. The steady-state PL intensity quenches follow the order of CdS-6000 > CdS-8000 > CdS-4000 > CdS-2000, indicating that the electron extraction and transporting properties follow the order of CdS-6000 > CdS-8000 > CdS-4000 > CdS-2000 which is completely in accordance with the photovoltaic performances of the corresponding devices. Fig. 6(b) shows the TRPL spectra of the perovskite film on different substrates. The TRPL curves in this experiment were analyzed with the tri-exponential decay function using the software of FluoFit and the extracted data are shown in Table 3. TRPL spectra can effectively demonstrate charge transfer kinetic processes, and a fast decay process tends to lead to prompt charge carrier extraction between the perovskite light-absorption layer and ESLs.14 In the case of the perovskite film on the FTO substrate, the PL decay times are τ1 = 67.82 ns, τ2 = 13.38 ns and τ3 = 770.00 ns, and the corresponding amplitudes are 74.03%, 25.38% and 0.59%. The average decay time (τave) is 58.16 ns. In comparison, when the perovskite is deposited on the CdS ESLs, the PL decay time drops distinctly, indiacting that the CdS ESLs are able to extract photo-generated carriers effectively. The τave of the perovskite deposited on the CdS ESLs is 31.52 ns, 15.75 ns, 9.08 ns and 9.80 ns, respectively.

4. Conclusions
In summary, CdS nanoparticles were fabricated using a facile solvothermal method and the as-synthesized CdS nanoparticles can be well re-dispersed in toluene to form a transparent uniform yellow solution. As a result, CdS films can be easily prepared by using a spin-coating method. More than that, this technology makes CdS films a special annealing-free ESL with high transparency and stability. Besides, the results of PL spectra demonstrate that CdS has outstanding electron extraction and transfer properties. The PSC device with the optimized CdS ESL achieves a significant PCE of 16.5%. This work indicates that taking the low-temperature solution-processed technology into consideration, CdS is an excellent ESM for low-cost, high-performance PSC devices. Furthermore, the prepared anhydrous CdS ink is also suitable for ESMs in inverted PSCs.
