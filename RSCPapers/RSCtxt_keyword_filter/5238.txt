    , Accepted 20th June 2020First published on 10th July 2020AbstractCesium–lead–bromide (CsPbBr3) is the simplest all inorganic halide perovskite. It serves as a reference material for understanding the exceptional solar cell properties of the organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskites and is itself discussed as an alternative absorber material. Broadband dielectric spectroscopy has proven to yield an in depth understanding of charge screening mechanisms in the halide solar cell absorbers based on methylammonium and modifications hereof. For a deeper understanding of charge carrier screening, we have investigated CsPbBr3 across wide temperature (120 K–450 K) and frequency ranges. Besides the two known phase transitions at 403 K and 361 K, the dielectric data show another anomaly around 220 K, which can be interpreted as another phase transition. XRD and EPR studies confirm the presence of this anomaly, but Raman scattering spectra do not show any lattice anomalies in the vicinity of 220 K. This additional anomaly is of first order character (different transition temperatures upon cooling and heating) but hardly influences the lattice dynamics. Our broadband dielectric investigations of CsPbBr3 display the same microwave limit permittivity as for MAPbX3 (εr ≈ 30, X = Cl, Br, I, MA = CH3NH3+) but do not afford a second permittivity relaxation up to this frequency. Our prior assignment of the second contribution in the methylammonium compounds being due to the relaxation dynamics of the methylammonium ion as a dipole is herewith proven. Nevertheless, CsPbBr3 shows large charge carrier screening up to very high frequencies which can still play a vital role in charge carrier dynamics and exciton behaviour in this material as well.
1. Introduction
During the past decade, the scientific community has witnessed a revival of lead halide perovskites. The primary interest of these materials is currently driven by their high photovoltaic efficiency, which by now exceeds 25% and may lead to high performance solar cells.1–3 These materials are also promising for applications as light emitting diodes (LEDs) and photodetectors.4 Their general chemical formula is APbX3, where X = I, Cl, Br, and A is a monovalent inorganic or organic cation. The A-site cation is located in a cuboctahedron cage formed by PbX6 octahedra. The most popular compositions amongst this family of materials are the methylammonium (MA = CH3NH3+), formamidinium (FA = NH2CHNH2+) and cesium (Cs+) lead halides.5
The high photovoltaic efficiency of the halide perovskites has been attributed to the effective exciton breakup,6 the long lifetime of the generated charge carriers7 and the high carrier mobilities.7 All these properties are closely related to the features of the dielectric response. The large high frequency (THz) dielectric permittivity is dominated by the relaxation of the PbX6 sub-lattice. It results in the low exciton binding energy. The dynamics of the MA cations having their proper dipole moment contributes to the large permittivity in the GHz range allowing for an effective screening of defects and the formation of hyperpolarons.8 There is still discussion about the necessity of having an organic molecule at the A-site to reach the high photovoltaic efficiencies.9,10 CsPbBr3 photovoltaic cells show an open circuit voltage comparable to MAPbBr3 cells.9 There are several reports showing that all-inorganic CsPbX3 solar cells can exceed the efficiency of around 10%.11–16 The most attractive feature of such solar cells is their stability compared to hybrid halides.11,17–19 Both MAPbBr3 and CsPbBr3 show similar band-edge carriers dynamics including low carrier trapping rate constants.10 On the other hand, according to transient photoluminescence and transient infrared spectroscopy studies, the lifetimes of the polarons in CsPbBr3 are one order of magnitude shorter than in MAPbBr3.20 Also, the polaron formation time in CsPbBr3 is more than two times longer as compared to MAPbBr3.21
In general, the dielectric response of materials is strongly connected to their crystalline structure. The studies of structural aspects of phase transitions in lead halide perovskites started several decades ago.22–26 In hybrid MAPbX3 (X = Cl, Br), the high temperature phase is cubic and belongs to the Pmm space group.27 MAPbCl3 (ref. 27 and 28) and MAPbBr3 (ref. 29 and 30) undergo transitions from the cubic to the tetragonal P4/mmm and I4/mcm phases, respectively, and afterwards from the tetragonal to the orthorhombic Pnma phase. In MAPbBr3, an intermediate phase between tetragonal and orthorhombic phases was reported, which was classified as either tetragonal P4/mmm27 or incommensurate.31
Inorganic CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br) perovskites also have the cubic Pmm structure at high temperatures. CsPbCl3 undergoes three consecutive phase transitions at 320 K, 315 K and 310 K.22,24,26 Fujii et al.25 determined the microscopic models of each phase by neutron scattering and showed that the phase transition sequence is cubic (Pmm)–tetragonal (P4/mbm)–orthorhombic (Cmcm)–monoclinic (P21/m).25 In contrast, only two phase transitions have been reported for CsPbBr3.23 One transition takes places at 403 K from a cubic to the tetragonal (P4/mbm) phase, and the second one at 361 K – from the tetragonal to the orthorhombic (Pmbn) phase. A third phase transition has not been reported so far for CsPbBr3, but, to our knowledge, only data above room temperature are available. All phase transitions in the cesium lead halides are of antidistortive type and occur due to the condensation of the soft mode at the Brillouin zone boundary, i.e. they are related to octahedral tilting.23
There is still a controversy about the nature of the low temperature state of MAPbBr3. Some reports claim that the lowest symmetry phase is polar,27 which leads to speculations about the ferroelectricity of these compounds. However, the absence of polarization switching, the character of the dielectric anomaly, the results of pyroelectric measurements and Monte Carlo simulations indicate the antipolar nature of this state.8,32 The centrosymmetric space group of the cesium lead halides excludes the ferroelectricity, but may allow for antipolar ordering.
It has been argued that local thermal polar fluctuations related to disorder in the PbX6 sub-lattice might be one of the reasons for the high photovoltaic performance.21,33,34 These fluctuations manifest themselves as a central peak in Raman spectra of the cubic and tetragonal phases. It was shown that the orthorhombic phase of CsPbBr3 has less pronounced disorder than the MAPbX3 halides.33
Contrary to the methylammonium lead halides, the cesium analogues are less studied, especially below room temperature. Low frequency dielectric permittivity down to room temperature was measured by Hirotsu et al. on CsPbCl3 crystals.22 They concluded that it does not possess any ferroelectric properties. However, there have not been thorough studies on the broadband dielectric properties of CsPbBr3 single crystals at different temperatures. A very recent publication by K. Miyata et al. reports on room temperature dielectric spectra of CsPbBr3 in the 106 Hz to 1011 Hz frequency range20 but it lacks the microwave data. The dielectric response is not only important for solar cell applications, but it is relevant for the newly emerging field of triboelectric nanogenerators.35–37
In this work, we report detailed structural, dielectric, Raman, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies of a CsPbBr3 single crystal and powder in a broad temperature range. In particular, we display a very high dielectric constant at high frequencies and reveal a new structural phase transition at 220 K. Since CsPbCl3 has three phase transitions,22,24,26 one would also expect a third transition in CsPbBr3.
2. Sample preparation and experimental details
CsPbBr3 single crystals were prepared by a low temperature solution-growth method described by Rakita et al.38 The precursor solution was prepared dissolving stoichiometric amounts of CsBr (Across organics 99.9%) and PbBr2 (Alfa Aesar 98+%) in DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide, Roth 99.5%) at 323 K at ambient conditions under stirring. After cooling, acetonitrile (analytical grade) was added dropwise to the solution until a permanent solid precipitate was formed. This precipitate (Cs4PbBr6) is a secondary product38 that is formed during the reaction and has been removed from the reaction mixture by filtration with a PTFE membrane filter with 0.2 μm size. The filtrate can be used as a precursor solution for crystal growth. The crystal growth was performed by the slow vapor saturation of acetonitrile as antisolvent. For this purpose, the filtered precursor solution was placed in a crystallization flask and covered with a filter paper and a glass Petri dish to control the antisolvent vapor diffusion. The covered crystallization flask was placed inside a bigger crystallization dish containing acetonitrile as the antisolvent. This big crystallization flask was also covered in a similar way as the smaller crystallization flask to maintain the antisolvent atmosphere in the closed system and avoid solvent loss. The crystals were obtained by heating the big crystallization flask at 313 K on a hot plate from two to three days. After 40 hours CsPbBr3 single crystals with approximate size of 1.5 × 4 × 1 mm3 were obtained. Larger crystals with the dimensions ranging from 4 × 6 × 2 mm3 to 6 × 8 × 2 mm3 have been obtained by further growth of the small crystals repeating the following procedure several times: filtration of the “mother” precursor solution plus addition of a small amount of fresh precursor solution and then putting this mixture into the antisolvent atmosphere on the hot plate under the same conditions as described above.
The XRD studies of the grown single crystals are presented in Fig. S1 of the ESI.† The 2θ scan of the single crystal only shows diffraction peaks from the (101), (202) and (303) planes indicating its single crystal nature. Rietveld analysis (GoF-index 2.8) of the pulverized crystal shows that the obtained data is in good agreement with the crystallographic data of PDF no. 98-009-7851, which corresponds to an orthorhombic crystal structure. No secondary phases can be seen in the XRD spectra, suggesting that the CsPbBr3 crystals are of good quality without impurities.
Some CsPbBr3 crystals were reduced into a fine powder and used for X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization. In situ XRD study of the powders was performed using a PANalytical X'Pert MPD PRO diffractometer (Ni-filtered Cu-Kα radiation, PIXcel1D detector, and an exposition time corresponding to 2 s per step of 0.02° over the angular range of 10°–70°). The measurements were conducted in Anton Paar chambers HTK 16N and TTK 450 in the temperature ranges of 298–453 K and 298–100 K, respectively. Rietveld refinement of the crystal structure was performed using the FullProf package.39
The powder of CsPbBr3 doped with paramagnetic Mn2+ ions was synthesized according to a previously published procedure40 by grinding the reactants in a ball mill (Retsch Ball Mill MM 400) using a grinding jar (10 ml) and a ball (ø10 mm) for 30 min at 25 Hz. The resulting perovskite powder was annealed at 523 K for 5 minutes to remove grinding-induced defects. The amounts of reagents taken into the synthesis were as follows: CsPb0.995Mn0.005Br3: 212.8 mg CsBr (1 mmol), 1.1 mg MnBr2 (0.005 mmol), 365.2 mg PbBr2 (0.995 mmol).
Complex dielectric permittivity was measured in two different frequency bands by two different techniques. A HP4824A LCR meter was used to cover the 20 Hz to 1 MHz frequency range. The sample was placed between two metal plates, and its capacitance and loss tangent (tanδ) were measured. The complex dielectric permittivity was calculated according to a flat capacitor model.
An Agilent 8714ET vector network analyzer was used for the experiments in the 1 MHz to 1 GHz frequency range. A coaxial line was connected to the analyzer, and the sample was placed at the end of the coaxial line. The complex reflection coefficient was measured. In order to get accurate results, a so-called “multimode capacitor” model was implemented, which takes into account higher order modes propagating in the vicinity of the sample. Thus, more accurate results can be obtained compared to a simple capacitor model at the end of the coaxial line. Details about the model can be found in the literature.41,42
The temperature during the dielectric spectroscopy experiments was measured using a Keithley Integra 2700 multimeter coupled with a T-type thermocouple or 100 Ω platinum resistor.
The continuous-wave (CW) EPR measurements were performed using a Bruker ELEXSYS E580 EPR spectrometer operating at X-band microwave frequency and equipped with a standard rectangular TE102 cavity. The strength and frequency of the modulating field were 5 G and 100 kHz, respectively. A variable nitrogen temperature control system was used to vary the temperature.
Raman spectra were collected on a Bruker MultiRAM spectrometer. The wavelength of the laser beam was 785 nm (below bandgap 2.34 eV corresponding to 525 nm). The laser power was 250 mW. The experiments were carried out in a backscattering geometry. During Raman scattering measurements the temperature of the samples were changed and maintained using a Linkam FTIR600 temperature-controlled stage.
Calorimetric measurements were performed using a differential scanning calorimeter (Netzsch, DSC 204 Phoenix). The sample was placed in gas tight aluminium crucibles to avoid any environmental perturbation. Temperature was changed in the range 130 K to 480 K with a rate of 10 K min−1. The measurement was performed on a single crystal of 9 mg mass in air.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 presents the DSC data on a CsPbBr3 single crystal. Several anomalies can be seen in the graph. The most evident anomaly is due to the phase transition slightly above 400 K from the cubic to the tetragonal phase. A much weaker anomaly is observed around 360 K, which indicates another phase transition to the orthorhombic phase. The temperatures of these transitions are consistent with the structural analysis data published by Hirotsu et al.23 However, there is another broad anomaly at around 220 K, which has not been reported in literature. Note that one of the previous studies showed that some changes of the light absorption spectrum occur around this temperature.43 The distortion around room temperature is due to an apparatus artifact.

Fig. 2a shows the temperature dependence of the real part of the dielectric permittivity measured at a frequency of 100 kHz. Step like anomalies corresponding to the cubic-tetragonal (∼410 K) and tetragonal-orthorhombic (∼360 K) transitions can be observed on cooling. A third anomaly at around 220 K is also visible, which can be seen more clearly in the inset of Fig. 2a. This anomaly is accompanied by a thermal hysteresis in accordance with the DSC data. Fig. 2b shows the temperature dependences of the real part of the dielectric permittivity measured at different frequencies. A strong dielectric dispersion is observed, which is related to the electronic conductivity of the crystal.

The inset shows the curves measured on both heating and cooling. (b) Temperature dependences of the real part of the dielectric permittivity measured at different frequencies. 

Fig. 3 presents the frequency dependences of the complex dielectric permittivity of the CsPbBr3 single crystal. It is evident that there is no dispersion at microwave frequencies even in the vicinity of the phase transitions. The situation differs from MAPbX3, where the mean relaxation time diverges in the vicinity of the tetragonal–orthorhombic phase transition (refer to Anusca et al.8 and Miyata et al.20). This suggests that the critical slowing down is absent in this material. Unfortunately, our single crystals were too small for dielectric measurements at higher frequencies. The data above 1 MHz yield a dielectric permittivity, ε∞ ∼27, having the same magnitude as the phonon contribution to the dielectric constant in the methylammonium lead halides.8 This assumption is in agreement with the recent paper by K. Miyata et al., who reported on the absence of the dielectric dispersion in the frequency range of 108 Hz to 1011 Hz (ref. 20) at room temperature. Yaffe et al.33 concluded that dynamic disorder and the central peak in all-inorganic and hybrid halides are very similar. Dielectric spectroscopy is capable of probing polar fluctuations directly. Our results show that the relaxation at microwave frequencies is absent in all-inorganic halides as opposed to the hybrid lead halides. This is an indication that the polar fluctuations are weaker in CsPbBr3. The reason behind the difference is the absence of a rotational movement of the Cs+ ion at the A-site which is different from the MA+-ion dipole which does rotate.
 Fig. 3  Frequency dependences of the complex dielectric permittivity of a CsPbBr3 single crystal at different temperatures. 
Let us discuss this last fact with respect to the outstanding solar cell performance of certain members of this class of materials. A high dielectric constant that acts on the unit cell level permits to lower the exciton binding energy which is very simply given by Coulomb's law. The interaction force linearly drops with the local dielectric constant. Thus, a high value of εr will directly yield a dissociation level on the order of kT and circumvents the problem of too tight binding of the charge carriers within the exciton. Furthermore, polarons which are electronic states coupling to the phonon bath, will have a considerably different effective cross section when moving through the lattice. Similarly, point defects (be they electronic or ionic of nature) are screened as well yielding a very small cross section as well. As long as the additional energy of the polaron relaxation around an electron (or hole) is low enough not to generate a small polaron (meaning it generates its proper band gap state), this is advantageous for the mobility and lifetime of the charge carriers in the halide perovskites. For a further discussion hereon, please refer to ref. 8. Apparently, this is optimal for MAPbI3 and dual or triple cation versions hereof including Cs.
To explore the low temperature anomaly at 220–230 K more thoroughly, CW EPR experiments on Mn-doped CsPbBr3 were performed. Furthermore, single crystals were also investigated by Raman spectroscopy. These two methods probe the local environment of the lattice revealing more details about the low temperature anomaly.

Fig. 4a presents CW EPR spectra of the Mn-doped CsPbBr3 powder taken at different temperatures. The spectra are typical for the Mn2+ ions having S = 5/2 electron and I = 5/2 nuclear spins.44 The observed hyperfine splitting of the central EPR transition is 234 MHz, which is typical for the Mn–Br bond.44 This indicates that Mn2+ substituted Pb2+ ions and forms MnBr6 octahedra.
 Fig. 4  (a) Temperature dependent CW EPR spectra of CsPbBr3:Mn. The arrows indicate fine structure lines, which were used to estimate the temperature dependence of the fine structure splitting presented in (b). 
In addition to the hyperfine splitting of the central transition, the outer fine structure lines are also partially resolved (indicated by the arrows in Fig. 4a). We used these lines to roughly estimate the temperature dependence of the fine structure, which is presented in Fig. 4b. A clear onset of the anomalous behavior of the fine structure is observed at 200 K indicating local structural changes of the Mn2+ ion environment. The splitting becomes noticeably smaller upon cooling, which is a rather unusual behavior.

Fig. 5 presents temperature dependent Raman spectra of the CsPbBr3 single crystal. Different representation of Raman spectra can be found in the Fig. S4 and S5 of the ESI.† The parent cubic phase (space group Pmm) is not supposed to have Raman active modes, but they are clearly observable at 450 K (40 K above the phase transition temperature). Such a situation is quite common for ferroelectric perovskite oxides like barium titanate.45 The persistence of Raman modes in the cubic phase indicates that some local distortions remain in the crystal lattice.46 Indeed, earlier studies of low frequency Raman spectroscopy of MAPbBr3 and CsPbBr3 by Yaffe et al. revealed that the central peak emerges with increasing temperature.33 The phase transitions in these perovskites are related to the octahedral tilts (which yield an antidistortive phase transition). The gradual decrease of the intensity of the spectral bands is observed when approaching the transition temperature at 406 K. The Raman fitting procedure reveals that the phonon mode at around 130 cm−1 undergoes softening (Fig. 6). This could indicate that the polar fluctuations are coupled with the octahedral tilts, which are responsible for the antidistortive phase transition (the softening in this case is away from the Brillouin zone center). Such phase transition should not be visible in Raman spectra unless it has some coupling to the local polar distortions.

 Fig. 6  Temperature dependence of mode frequency obtained from analysis of the Raman spectra. 
The tetragonal–orthorhombic phase transition at 360 K does not show any pronounced phonon anomaly. The mode at 130 cm−1, which acts as a “soft mode” around the cubic-tetragonal phase transition, only monotonously hardens with the decrease of temperature (Fig. 6). Higher frequency modes (at 160 cm−1 and 310 cm−1) monotonously soften with increasing temperature (Fig. 6). No anomaly can be observed at around 220 K. However, the accuracy of the analysis may not be sufficient to observe very small changes in the Raman spectra, as the experimental results discussed above reveal that the anomaly is rather weak. This indicates that different octahedral tilts suppress the polar fluctuations. Thus, they do not give such a contribution in the lower symmetry phases. We assume that the polar fluctuations are negligible in tetragonal and orthorhombic phase. This gives a hint that the most efficient materials for solar energy conversion should be in the cubic phase so that the polar fluctuations contribute to the solar conversion via contribution to the dielectric properties. Namely ease exciton splitting and polaron formation.
To clarify the nature of the low temperature anomaly at 220 K, the crystal structure behavior of CsPbBr3 was thoroughly studied. XRD data were collected first on the as-prepared powder upon cooling, then upon heating to 453 K followed by cooling. The powder thermally treated at 453 K for 15 min was studied again upon cooling from room temperature down to 100 K. From the visual inspection of the obtained XRD patterns, it was found that the crystal structure of CsPbBr3 is orthorhombic below 360 K, tetragonal between 360 K and 410 K and cubic above 410 K, which is in agreement with literature.23,47 All studied samples show the perovskite phase without impurities. No variation in the XRD patterns that could indicate a symmetry change has been detected in the vicinity of 220 K. Crystal structure refinement was successful using the space groups Pbnm (orthorhombic phase), P4/mbm (tetragonal phase), and Pmm (cubic phase).23,47 Crystal structure distortions of the cubic lattice associated with decreasing temperature are induced by in-phase octahedral tilting about the c-axis that results in tetragonal symmetry and appearance of the √2ap × √2ap × ap superstructure (where ap is the pseudocubic perovskite unit-cell parameter). The next reduction in symmetry occurs because of an onset of anti-phase octahedral tilting along the axes a and b. This leads to the orthorhombic symmetry with the √2ap × √2ap × 2ap superstructure. Using Glazer's notation,48 the aforementioned sequence can be expressed as: a0a0a0 → a0a0c+ → a−a−c+.
For easy comparison and analysis, the lattice parameters of the orthorhombic and the tetragonal phases obtained from Rietveld refinement were recalculated to the parameters of the primitive perovskite unit cell: ap = bp≠ cp, αp = βp = 90° ≠ γp (Pbnm phase) and ap = bp ≠ cp, αp = βp = γp = 90° (P4/mbm phase). Fig. 7 demonstrates the temperature behavior of the parameters ap, cp and γp.
 Fig. 7  The primitive perovskite cell parameters of CsPbBr3 as a function of temperature upon heating. 
The observed change in the ap(T) and bp(T) behaviors clearly displays the phase transitions. In the range of the tetragonal phase, the thermal expansion along the cp-axis is negative; after the tetragonal-to-cubic transformation, ap = cp.
The phase transition between the tetragonal and cubic phases was studied upon heating and cooling by estimation of the full width at half maximum of the diffraction multiplet (002)p, which is sensitive to the tetragonal distortion. It was found that this first-order transition47 demonstrates a temperature hysteresis of around 7 K (Fig. S2 in the ESI†). No temperature hysteresis has been detected at the Pbnm–P4/mbm transition, which indicates that it is of second-order nature.
Above 360 K, the primitive perovskite unit cell angle γp is 90° indicating the disappearance of the anti-phase tilting. Below 360 K, it decreases monotonically, and between 220 and 100 K the γp(T) dependence is almost linear.
It was revealed that the diffraction reflections in the XRD patterns become narrower after the thermal treatment (annealing) at 453 K. This clearly indicates a stress release or/and annealing of defects.
The primitive perovskite unit cell volume (Vp) as a function of temperature is shown in Fig. 8. One can see that the near-linear Vp(T) dependence changes slope at the temperature of the Pbnm–P4/mbm and the P4/mbm–Pmm transitions. This is in agreement with the results on the linear expansion of single-crystal CsPbBr3 reported by Rodová et al.47 It is seen from Fig. 8 that a change of the slope similar to those that occur at the aforementioned phase transitions is also observed at around 220 K within the range of the orthorhombic Pbnm structure of CsPbBr3. The peculiar temperature behavior of Vp in the vicinity of 220 K is more pronounced in the sample annealed at 453 K (see inset in Fig. 8).

Red solid lines represent linear fits of the Vp(T) dependence in the ranges of the cubic and the tetragonal phases as well as in the range of 100–220 K of the orthorhombic phase. The inset shows the temperature dependences of Vp for the same powder sample before and after annealing at 453 K for 15 min. 
The observed anomaly of the temperature dependence of the unit cell volume of the orthorhombic CsPbBr3 can indicate a redistribution of the lead–bromine bond distances within the PbBr6 octahedra. Non-monotonic and other unexpected thermal behaviors of the crystal lattice parameters have been observed in a monoclinic phase of La(Mg1/2Ti1/2)O3,49 in a hexagonal high-temperature phase of YMnO3,50 in a orthorhombic phase of Sr3Sn2O7 (ref. 51) and have been attributed to isostructural transitions (transformations). It should be noticed that all the above-mentioned oxygen-octahedral compositions demonstrated anomalies of their dielectric behavior in the respective temperature ranges.
Finally, for the sake of an argument about the absence of ferroelectric order, polarization hysteresis loops were measured below room temperature. In MAPbBr3 the low temperature state is antipolar. The obtained data for of CsPbBr3 are presented in the ESI (Fig. S3†) clearly indicating lack of spontaneous polarization. This means that even below 220 K, the material does not go into a ferroelectric phase. This is an unambiguous experiment that concludes on the speculations of ferroic order in these materials.
Conclusions
DSC, broadband dielectric, and EPR studies revealed an anomaly in CsPbBr3 at around 220 K. Detailed XRD studies confirm an isostructural phase transition at 220 K. This transition shows a thermal hysteresis and, from the structural point of view, it can be related to a redistribution of the lead–bromine bond distances within the PbBr6 octahedra. According to the dielectric data and polarization measurements, the crystal remains paraelectric at all temperatures.
Similar to the MAPbX3 compounds, CsPbBr3 shows a high dielectric permittivity in the microwave frequency range. The lattice relaxation contribution to the dielectric response is of the order of εr ∼ 30. There is no additional relaxation in the microwave range of frequencies, so this is the only contribution present in the all inorganic CsPbBr3. The value is exactly the same as the high frequency value for the methylammonium compositions MAPbX3 (the same for all three halides). The organic molecular cation MA provides yet another contribution of Δεr = 30. So screening is very effective in CsPbBr3, but it is still stronger in the organic-inorganic hybrids. This can essentially explain the differences and similarities in exciton breakup, polaron formation, charge carrier lifetime and charge carrier mean free path between the all inorganic CsPbBr3 and hybrid MAPbX3 compounds. A weaker screening of charge carriers in CsPbBr3 results in their faster scattering on defects and may be a reason of the lower photovoltaic efficiency.
