    , Accepted 15th May 2019First published on 20th May 2019AbstractTwo regioisomeric wide-bandgap (WBG) polymers, PDBT(E)BTz-p and PDBT(E)BTz-d, with different nitrogen topologies along the conjugated backbone were developed and applied in non-fullerene polymer solar cells. Both polymers exhibit deeper ionization potential (IP) enabled by the synergistic electron-withdrawing effect of chlorine atoms and ester substituents. The effects of different nitrogen topologies on polymeric backbone linearity and optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties are systematically investigated. When blended with the electron acceptor IT-4F, the PDBT(E)BTz-p-based device delivers a PCE of 6.96% with a high VOC of 0.98 V and a low energy loss of 0.55 eV, while the PDBT(E)BTz-d-based device exhibits a higher PCE of 7.81% with an improved FF. Furthermore, PDBT(E)BTz-d is found to be effective as the third component in a binary PBDB-T-SF:IT-4F system to enhance device efficiencies from 12.1% for the binary device to 13.4% for the ternary device with 5 wt% PDBT(E)BTz-d relative to PBDB-T-SF. It is observed that an internal Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between PDBT(E)BTz-d and PBDB-T-SF gives rise to the improvement of external quantum efficiency and JSC. These results demonstrate that the WBG polymer featuring deeper IP can not only enhance the VOC but can also act as a sensitizer to transfer energy through the FRET mechanism toward highly efficient ternary PSCs. In addition, this contribution provides a new idea for the design and synthesis of conjugated polymers for organic electronics.
Introduction
Polymer solar cell (PSC) technology has attracted intense interest during the past few decades with significantly improved performance and versatile potential.1–8 Typical binary PSCs consist of a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) active layer formed by casting a mixed solution of an electron donating polymer and an electron accepting molecule(s) such as a fullerene derivative.9–11 Recently, non-fullerene (NF) small molecule acceptors (SMAs) as alternatives to traditional fullerene derivatives have been seriously considered due to their advantage of high flexibility in tuning electrochemical and optoelectronic properties via a relatively simple synthesis route.12–23 So far, state-of-the-art single-junction PSCs based on these novel SMAs have achieved a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) in excess of 15% and a better thermal stability as well, indicating the significance of molecular engineering in organic photovoltaics.24–26
Thanks to the rapid development of medium-bandgap (MBG) and narrow-bandgap (NBG) NF SMAs, the selection of an ideal wide-bandgap (WBG) polymer with complementary absorption in the short wavelength region and a deeper highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level as the electron donor material is reasonable to surmount the fundamental compromise between the photocurrent and photovoltage output.27–33 For example, Li et al. synthesized a series of WBG PDTB-EF-T polymers which achieved an open circuit voltage (VOC) of ca. 0.90 V as well as a short-circuit current density (JSC) of ca. 20 mA cm−2 when blended with the MBG acceptor material IT-4F.34 Yuan et al. recently reported a newly designed NBG SMA Y6. PSCs based on the acceptor material Y6 and donor material PM6 exhibited a record PCE of 15.7% with a JSC of ca. 25 mA cm−2 and FF of ca. 0.75,24 while the VOC was only ca. 0.83 V. On the other hand, the development of WBG polymers is also crucially important for a given tandem or ternary blend device with the aim of harvesting more photons from the solar spectrum.35–37 However, the exploration of electron donating polymers has lagged far behind, especially for polymers with a bandgap greater than 2.0 eV, compared to the progress made on SMAs. Therefore, investigations on a novel WBG polymer featuring a deep HOMO energy level and its structure–property relationship have important implications for not only the understanding of judicious molecular design in organic electronics but also the enhancement of PSC device performance.
The classic WBG polymers are mainly homopolymers such as MDMO-PPV and P3HT. This type of polymer usually comprises a single aromatic unit or fused aromatic rings and has been studied for several decades. Subsequently, the strategy of constructing conjugated copolymers based on the donor (D) and acceptor (A) units has been widely adopted to tune the structural and optoelectronic properties.38–40 The modulation of the bandgap is very often accompanied by a careful choice of the D and A units due to the fact that the HOMO and lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels are mainly localized on the D unit and the A unit, respectively. To obtain WBG copolymers based on this design strategy, both the electron-donating ability of the D moiety and the electron-withdrawing ability of the A moiety should be relatively weak for lowering the HOMO energy level and raising the LUMO energy level simultaneously. Among various A units used to design WBG polymers, bithiazole (BTz) deserves special attention because of its weak electron-withdrawing ability and coplanar structures. In addition, polymers based on the bithiazole unit exhibit lower/deeper energy levels than the bithiophene-based analogues.41 In the fullerene PSC era, alkylated 2,2′-bithiazole units had been commonly used for polymerization with various D units and these polymers blended with PC61BM exhibited PCEs over 6%. Guo et al. recently reported a newly designed WBG polymer PTZ6 based on nonyl-substituted 2,2′-bithiazoe units, exhibiting an ionization potential (IP) of −5.36 eV and a high PCE of 10.3% with a VOC of 1.01 V, when blended with ITIC.42 However, polymers based on bare 2,2′-bithiazole units have been seldom explored, and their application in NF–PSCs is quite rare. In addition, another regioisomer of 2,2′-bithiazole, i.e. 5,5′-bithiazole, has rarely been reported regarding its synthesis and application in organic photovoltaics. Furthermore, it remains unclear how the regiochemistry of nitrogen atoms in bithiazole affects the optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties of the polymers.
Herein, we designed and synthesized two regioisomeric WBG polymers based on 2,2′-bithiazole and 5,5′-bithiazole respectively, namely PDBT(E)BTz-p and PDBT(E)BTz-d (Fig. 1a), with a deeper IP enabled by the synergistic electron-withdrawing effect of chlorine atoms and ester substituents. The influence of different nitrogen topologies on polymeric backbone linearity and optoelectronic, π–π stacking and photovoltaic properties is systematically investigated. As will be shown, the two regioisomeric polymers have comparable frontier molecular orbital energy levels; however, the dihedral angle between ester-substituted thiophene and thiazole for PDBT(E)BTz-p is larger than that for PDBT(E)BTz-d, inducing different polymer chain conformations. As a result, PDBT(E)BTz-d based on 5,5′-bithiazole shows better backbone coplanarity than 2,2′-bithiazole-based PDBT(E)BTz-p, resulting in a small red-shifted absorption spectrum, enhanced extinction coefficient of a thin film and up-shifted IP. Using IT-4F as an electron acceptor, the PDBT(E)BTz-p-based PSC device delivered a PCE of 6.96% with a VOC of 0.98 V, a JSC of 14.38 mA cm−2 and a FF of 48.2%, while the PDBT(E)BTz-d-based PSC device showed a higher PCE of 7.81% with a VOC of 0.95 V, a JSC of 14.68 mA cm−2 and a FF of 54.4%. Further exploration focused on the ternary PSCs. Starting from the host binary PBDB-T-SF:IT-4F system, we incorporated PDBT(E)BTz-p and PDBT(E)BTz-d as the third component respectively. The device efficiencies were shown to increase from 12.1% for the control binary device to 13.4% for the ternary device after the addition of 5 wt% PDBT(E)BTz-d relative to PBDB-T-SF. We found that internal Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between PBDB-T-SF and PDBT(E)BTz-d gives rise to the enhancement of external quantum efficiency in the wavelength region between 300 nm and 600 nm and the ultimate PCE.

Results and discussion
Molecular design consideration and theoretical calculation
In order to obtain the WBG polymer with deep HOMO energy levels, two main molecular design points were considered: (i) a careful choice of the A unit with relatively weak electron-withdrawing ability and good backbone coplanarity; (ii) introducing strong electron-withdrawing substituents and functional groups. In this work, bithiazole was chosen as the A unit, and meanwhile, we introduced Cl atoms on the two-dimensional conjugated thiophene in D units and ester substituents on the thiophene π bridge. For enhancing the solubility of the polymer, branched 2-butyloctyl was chosen as the side chains. Furthermore, to gain a finer degree of structural understanding for rational molecular design, we also investigated how different nitrogen topologies along the polymeric backbone affect the properties of polymers.
The optimized molecular geometries and frontier orbital structures of the two polymers were calculated using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G (d, p) level. Alkyl chain 2-butyloctyl groups in the polymers were truncated to methyl groups for simplifying calculations. As shown in Fig. 1b, the differences in the two polymers lie mostly in the dihedral angles between the ester-substituted thiophene and the adjacent thiazole, i.e. θ2 and θ4. The value of θ2 in PDBT(E)BTz-p is 20.60°, whereas this angle in the PDBT(E)BTz-d is reduced to 0.29°. The torsion angle of θ4 is 20.83° in the polymer PDBT(E)BTz-p versus 0.53° in the PDBT(E)BTz-d. These results indicate that PDBT(E)BTz-d based on 5,5′-bithiazole has better backbone coplanarity compared to 2,2′-bithiazole-based PDBT(E)BTz-p. With regard to the molecular orbitals of the two polymers, the HOMO molecular orbitals are well delocalized along their backbones, while the LUMO molecular orbitals are mainly localized on the ester-substituted thiophenes and the bithiazole. The calculated HOMO energy level of PDBT(E)BTz-p is −5.14 eV, lower than the −5.08 eV of PDBT(E)BTz-d, while the LUMO energy level of PDBT(E)BTz-p is higher than that of PDBT(E)BTz-d, i.e. −2.66 eV versus −2.70 eV.
Synthesis routes and characterization
Detailed synthetic routes to monomers and polymers are described in Scheme 1. The monomer (4,8-bis(2-(2-butyloctyl)-3-chlorothiophene)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) (3) was synthesized according to the methods commonly used for the preparation of two-dimensional benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene analogues. The monomers bis(2-butyloctyl) 2,2′-([2,2′-bithiazole]-5,5′-diyl)bis(5-bromothiophene-3-carboxylate) (9) and bis(2-butyloctyl) 2,2′-([5,5′-bithiazole]-2,2′-diyl)bis(5-bromothiophene-3-carboxylate) (13) were differentiated by the position of nitrogen atoms along the conjugated backbone. Compound 1 was obtained in 83% yield from 3-chlorothiophene. Selective lithiation with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) of compound 1 and subsequent reaction with dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-5,10-dione afforded compound 2 in 63% yield, which was then stannylated to give compound 3. Compound 6 and 10 were synthesized in 60% and 40% yields via a Pd(OAc)2-catalytic homocoupling reaction of 2-bromothiazole and 5-bromothiazole, respectively. Then, compound 6 was stannylated at the 5-position to give compound 7 in 90% yield. However, the synthesis of 2,2′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-5,5′-bithiazole failed, which may be caused by the instability of the lithio-5,5′-bithiazole salts during the lithiation/stannylation reactions of compound 10 according to the literature.43 Hence, we chose the bromination reaction of compound 10 with N-bromobutanimide to give compound 11 in 40% yield. Compound 8 was synthesized by the Stille reaction between compound 7 and compound 4 in 90% yield, whereas the isomeric compound 12 was prepared by the Suzuki reaction between compound 11 and compound 5 in 82% yield. The polymers were prepared via the Stille coupling reaction using Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst and toluene as the solvent at 110 °C.

The molecular weights of polymers were measured by high-temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the eluent at 150 °C. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) of PDBT(E)BTz-p and PDBT(E)BTz-d are 15.0 and 17.5 kDa with polydispersity indices (PDIs) of 2.46 and 2.90, respectively. All the polymers exhibited sufficient solubility in commonly used organic solvents and good thermal stability with 5% weight loss temperatures higher than 300 °C (Fig. S1 in the ESI†).
Optical, electrochemical, and electronic properties
The absorption spectra of the polymers in chloroform solutions and thin films are shown in Fig. 2 and the detailed optical data are summarized in Table 1. The absorption spectra (Fig. 2a) of PDBT(E)BTz-p and PDBT(E)BTz-d in chlorobenzene (CB) solutions exhibit similar absorption profiles with two spectral features, i.e., a high-energy absorption peak that is attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interaction and a low-energy absorption peak that is caused by the molecular packing, implying the strong aggregation properties of both polymers. Besides, the spectra show almost the same maximum absorption peak intensity with identical polymer concentration. However, the maximum absorption peak of PDBT(E)BTz-d is red-shifted by 17 nm compared to that of PDBT(E)BTz-p, implying that the PDBT(E)BTz-d has a more effective electronic delocalization than the PDBT(E)BTz-p, which is consistent with the theoretical calculation results. In the thin films (Fig. 2b), the absorption features of each polymer show no significant difference compared to those in the solution state, indicating that the molecular packing arrangements of aggregates are not altered by solidification. The absorption coefficient (ε) of the PDBT(E)BTz-p film is 6.31 × 104 cm−1, while the ε value of PDBT(E)BTz-d is increased to 8.76 × 104 cm−1. According to the absorption onset in the film spectra, the optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of PDBT(E)BTz-p and PDBT(E)BTz-d are 2.02 ev and 2.00 eV, respectively.

The electrochemical properties of the two polymers were probed by cyclic voltammetry (CV), using a glassy carbon disk, a platinum (Pt) wire, and an Ag/Ag+ electrode as the working electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode, respectively, with a scanning rate of 20 mV s−1 in a 0.1 mol L−1 tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) acetonitrile solution. Additionally, ferrocene was used as an internal standard for electrochemical measurements. Fig. 2c shows the CV plots of the polymers. The ionization potential (IP) and electron affinity (EA) were determined from the onsets of the oxidation potential and reduction potential, respectively. The estimated IPs and EAs of PDBT(E)BTz-p and PDBT(E)BTz-d were −5.65 eV/−3.65 eV and −5.60 eV/−3.68 eV, respectively. The space-charge-limited current (SCLC) technique was employed to measure the hole mobility of neat polymer films.44 The device structure is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer/CuPc:Spiro-TPD/Au. Fig. S2† shows the current dependence on applied field plots of hole-only transporting devices. The hole mobilities of PDBT(E)BTz-p and PDBT(E)BTz-d were calculated to be 7.3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.
Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic properties of polymers PDBT(E)BTz-p and PDBT(E)BTz-d were investigated with a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BHJ active layer/PFN-Br/Ag (shown in Fig. 3a). To achieve complementary light absorption and well-matched energy levels with both polymers, a small molecule IT-4F was selected as the acceptor material to fabricate the binary devices. The chemical structures of IT-4F and PFN-Br are provided in Fig. 3b. In addition, to better evaluate the suitability of the energy levels between the polymers and IT-4F, the electrochemical properties of IT-4F were also measured by CV together with those of the polymers (Fig. S3†), and the energy-level alignments are presented in Fig. 3c. The devices were optimized by varying the blend ratio, thermal annealing and solvent additive to achieve the optimal photovoltaic performance. The optimal conditions for the devices of PDBT(E)BTz-p:IT-4F and PDBT(E)BTz-d:IT-4F are identical to those for a blend D/A ratio of 1/1 (wt/wt) without any post treatment. Fig. 3d shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of solar cells under AM 1.5 G 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) simulated solar illumination and the detailed parameters are listed in Table 2. The device with the as-cast PDBT(E)BTz-p:IT-4F film gave a VOC of 0.98 V, a JSC of 14.93 mA cm−2 and a FF of 47.6%, yielding a best PCE of 6.96%, while the PDBT(E)BTz-d:IT-4F-based device showed a slightly decreased VOC (0.95 V) owing to the up-shifted IP, a comparable JSC of 15.09 mA cm−2, and an improved FF (54.5%), achieving a PCE of 7.81%. It is worth mentioning that the energy loss (Eloss) estimated using the equation Eloss = Eoptg − eVOC is 0.55 eV in the PDBT(E)BTz-p:IT-4F-based device, which is the lowest reported Eloss value in IT-4F based OPV devices. Eoptg is obtained from the optical bandgap of IT-4F (1.53 eV). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the optimal devices are provided in Fig. 3e. The integral current densities calculated from the EQE curves are 14.93 and 15.44 mA cm−2 for the PDBT(E)BTz-p:IT-4F- and PDBT(E)BTz-d:IT-4F-based devices, respectively, which are consistent with the measured JSC values in the J–V test.

The ternary blend strategy has been proven to be very successful for improving the device performance.45–57 We therefore fabricated ternary solar cells by using PDBT(E)BTz-p or PDBT(E)BTz-d as the third component in the base binary system PBDB-T-SF:IT-4F.58–60 The absorption coefficient spectra of PBDB-T-SF and IT-4F in thin films are displayed in Fig. 2b. The electrochemical properties of PBDB-T-SF were also measured by CV (Fig. S3†) together with those of the aforesaid materials and the energy level alignments are presented in Fig. 3c. We found that the IPs of PDBT(E)BTz-p and PDBT(E)BTz-d are about halfway between those of PBDB-T-SF and IT-4F, implying a possible cascade energy heterojunction in ternary blends. In this work, we use the recipe reported by Hou et al. (inverted structure) to fabricate the control binary devices, but with a conventional device structure (Fig. 3a).61 The detailed procedures are presented in the ESI.† The binary device based on PBDB-T-SF:IT-4F showed a VOC of 0.86 V, a JSC of 19.49 mA cm−2 and a FF of 72.2%, delivering a PCE of 12.1%. The relative content of the third component with respect to the host PBDB-T-SF was optimized by fixing the total D/A (D = PBDB-T-SF + third component polymer) ratio to 1:1. As shown in Fig. 3d and Table 2, after blending with 5 wt% PDBT(E)BTz-d relative to the polymer PBDB-T-SF as the third component, the device efficiency increases to 13.4%, which resulted from obvious improvement in the JSC (20.68 mA cm−2) and FF (75.3%). When using PDBT(E)BTz-p as the third component, the PCE was slightly increased to 12.5% with an improvement of the JSC (19.93 mA cm−2). The EQE difference (ΔEQE) was calculated to understand the reason for the increased photocurrent. As shown in Fig. 3f, the EQE response of the PDBT(E)BTz-d-based ternary device exhibits an improvement in the wavelength region between 300 nm and 720 nm. Since the third component polymer (5%) showed negligible absorption in this range, the EQE increase here should originate from the evolution in the host PBDB-T-SF and IT-4F.
To explore the charge generation in the aforesaid optimal devices, the photocurrent density (Jph) (Jph = JL − JD, JL and JD are the current density under illumination and in the dark) as a function of the effective voltage (Veff) (Veff = V0 − Va, V0 is the voltage at Jph = 0 and Va is the applied voltage) of the optimal devices is plotted in Fig. 3g. The ratios of Jph/Jsat under short circuit conditions were used to estimate the exciton dissociation efficiency. Comparable Pdiss values of 96.5% and 94.8% were achieved for the optimal PDBT(E)BTz-p:IT-4F- and PDBT(E)BTz-d:IT-4F-based devices, respectively. It is worth noting that the charge generation in the PDBT(E)BTz-p:IT-4F system is efficient even though the ΔEIP between PDBT(E)BTz-p and IT-4F is very small −0.07 eV. For the PBDB-T-SF:IT-4F-based control device, the Pdiss is 97.5%, which is higher than that for the PDBT(E)BTz-p-based ternary device (94.1%) and PDBT(E)BTz-d-based ternary device (94.2%). Light intensity dependent JSC and VOC measurements were carried out to investigate the charge recombination mechanism in devices. According to the relationship of JSC ∝ Pαlight, if the bimolecular recombination of the charge carriers is negligible, the power-law exponent α equals to 1. As displayed in Fig. 3h, the slopes of α for the optimal PDBT(E)BTz-p:IT-4F- and PDBT(E)BTz-d:IT-4F-based binary devices were 0.783 and 0.883, respectively, suggesting a significant charge recombination in corresponding devices. In PDBT(E)BTz-p- and PDBT(E)BTz-d-based ternary devices, the slopes of α were increased to 0.978 and 0.971, respectively, compared to that (0.932) of the PBDB-T-SF:IT-4F-based control device, implying that the small addition of the third component polymer has no detrimental effect on the charge recombination of devices. The VOC as a function of the natural logarithm of Plight was plotted to distinguish the main loss mechanism in devices. According the relationship of , the value of n = 2 represents significant monomolecular recombination and n = 1 represents dominant bimolecular recombination (T = 300 K). As observed in Fig. 3i, the values of n for PDBT(E)BTz-p:IT-4F- and PDBT(E)BTz-d:IT-4F-based binary devices were 1.59 and 1.42, respectively, indicating the significant Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination in these two devices. For PDBT(E)BTz-p- and PDBT(E)BTz-d-based ternary devices, the values of n were 1.22 and 1.21, respectively, which are comparable to that (1.26) for the PBDB-T-SF:IT-4F-based control device. Overall, the results indicate that the charge extraction in PDBT(E)BTz-p:IT-4F- and PDBT(E)BTz-d:IT-4F-based binary devices is limited by serious charge recombination and SRH recombination, in agreement with the low FF values obtained for the devices. However, when these two deep HOMO polymers PBDT(E)BTz-p and PBDT(E)BTz-d were used as the few additions of the third component polymer in the PBDB-T-SF:IT-4F-based control device, the recombination losses can be reduced effectively. In addition, the larger non-geminate recombination losses (including bimolecular charge recombination and SRH recombination) in the PDBT(E)BTz-p-based binary device than in the PDBT(E)BTz-d-based counterpart may suggest the relative inferiority of PDBT(E)BTz-p as the third component compared to PDBT(E)BTz-d. Actually, as the content of the third component polymer increased, the PCE of the PDBT(E)BTz-p-based ternary device dropped more pronouncedly compared to that of the PDBT(E)BTz-d-based ternary device, as shown in Table S1.†
Photoluminescence analysis and morphology analysis
The photoluminescence (PL) technique was employed to study the charge transfer and energy transfer behaviours in the blend films. Fig. 4a shows the PL spectra of pure PDBT(E)BTz-p, PDBT(E)BTz-d, PDBT(E)BTz-p:IT-4F and PDBT(E)BTz-d:IT-4F films under excitation at 530 nm and 545 nm, respectively. The pure PDBT(E)BTz-p film exhibits a broad PL emission region from the wavelength of 565 nm to 800 nm with a maximum at 620 nm, while the PL maximum of the pure PDBT(E)BTz-d film demonstrates a slight (7 nm) red-shift compared to that of PDBT(E)BTz-p. As shown in Fig. 4d, the pristine IT-4F film displays a PL maximum at 800 nm under excitation at 765 nm. In the blend films of PDBT(E)BTz-p:IT-4F and PDBT(E)BTz-d:IT-4F, the PL emissions of PDBT(E)BTz-p and PDBT(E)BTz-d are almost completely quenched by IT-4F. The PL emission of IT-4F can also be efficiently quenched by the PDBT(E)BTz-p and PDBT(E)BTz-d, indicating the efficient exciton dissociation in the two blend films. To understand the ternary systems, the PL emissions of PBDB-T-SF:PDBT(E)BTz-p and PBDB-T-SF:PDBT(E)BTz-d blend films with different weight ratios were studied, and showed evidence of energy transfer between PBDB-T-SF and PDBT(E)BTz-p as well as PDBT(E)BTz-d. As shown in Fig. 4b, a small addition of PDBT(E)BTz-p to the PDBDB-T-SF with a weight ratio of 0.05/1 results in a remarkable enhancement (by a factor of ∼3) of the PL intensity compared to that of the pristine PBDB-T-SF film. In addition, the intensity of PL peaks in PDBT(E)BTz-p:PDBDB-T-SF blend films shows a varying trend which firstly increases (up to 0.1/1 ratio) then decreases along with the increase of the PDBT(E)BTz-p content. Similar phenomena were observed in the PL spectra of PDBT(E)BTz-d:PDBDB-T-SF blend films, shown in Fig. 4c. Taking into account that there is an apparent overlap between the absorption of PBDB-T-SF and the PL spectra of PDBT(E)BTz-p and PDBT(E)BTz-d (Fig. S4†), we suggest that an internal excitation transfer between PBDB-T-SF and PDBT(E)BTz-p/PDBT(E)BTz-d via FRET gives rise to the improvement of the PL intensity, resulting in the enhancement of charge generation and ultimately of JSC.

(b) PL spectra of PBDB-T-SF, PBDB-T-SF/PDBT(E)BTz-p (with different weight ratios), and PDBT(E)BTz-p (ternary) films, the samples were excited at 616 nm.

Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was performed to investigate the molecular packing and crystallinity properties of the pristine polymer, small molecule and blend films.62–68 Fig. S5† displays the 2D GIWAXS patterns of the pristine films and the corresponding intensity profiles in the out-of-plane (OOP) and in-plane (IP) directions. The pristine PDBT(E)BTz-p and PDBT(E)BTz-d films exhibit clear lamellar (100), (200), and (300) scattering peaks along the OOP direction and a π–π stacking (010) reflection along the IP direction, indicating that they are highly “edge-on” oriented. The pristine PBDB-T-SF film shows a preferential “face-on” orientation, indicated by the pronounced π–π peak along the OOP direction. The π–π stacking distances of PDBT(E)BTz-p, PDBT(E)BTz-d and PBDB-T-SF films are 3.63 Å (1.73 Å−1), 3.63 Å (1.73 Å−1), and 3.70 Å (1.70 Å−1), respectively, while the lamellar distances are 20.9 Å (0.300 Å−1), 21.3 Å (0.295 Å−1), and 19.9 Å (0.315 Å−1), respectively. The pure IT-4F film exhibits a (100) diffraction peak at 0.420 Å−1 (15.0 Å) and a (010) peak at 1.54 Å−1 (4.08 Å). After binary blending, PDBT(E)BTz-p:IT-4F exhibited relatively higher aggregation and tighter packing compared with PDBT(E)BTz-d:IT-4F, as shown in Fig. 5. This is demonstrated by the overall higher scattering intensity and the shifting of lamellar distances and peaks to higher q values (0.315 Å−1 and 1.78 Å−1 respectively), whereas the peak position remained unchanged for the PDBT(E)BTz-d:IT-4F film (0.300 Å−1 and 1.77 Å−1 respectively). The orientation of the molecular packing became randomized for both films. The scattering patterns of PBDB-T-SF:IT-4F and the ternary films presented similar scattering intensity, “face-on” orientation and lattice constants (dlamellar = 20.3 Å−1 and d = 3.55 Å−1). These results suggest that the ternary films retained the molecular packing of the binary PBDB-T-SF:IT-4F film, which is consistent with the low concentration of the third component (PDBT(E)BTz-p or PDBT(E)BTz-d). In our former study of multiple donor polymer solar cells with a PCBM acceptor, we have found that the polymer compatibility–preferred molecular orientation matching is an important factor determining the multiple-donor polymer solar cell efficiency, when each multiple donor has significant loading in the blend film.69 In this work, although the third component is of different preferred molecular orientation, the low loading does not seem to affect the nano-morphology (and thus transport) in the PSC system. When the concentration of the third component increased, we observed an efficiency drop (Table S1†).

The morphologies of PDBT(E)BTz-p:IT-4F and PDBT(E)BTz-d:IT-4F blend films were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to get more information on the different device performance.70 The AFM topography images (Fig. S6a and c†) indicate that the top surface of the PDBT(E)BTz-p:IT-4F blend film is more smooth compared to that of the PDBT(E)BTz-d:IT-4F blend with a mean square surface roughness (Rq) of 2.53 nm versus 4.37 nm. The AFM phase images (Fig. S6b and d†) show that the PDBT(E)BTz-p:IT-4F film is relatively uniform, whereas phase aggregations with orientational texture in the PDBT(E)BTz-d:IT-4F blend film can be observed. In addition, as displayed in Fig. S6(e) and (f),† the TEM images of the PDBT(E)BTz-p:IT-4F film are featureless; however, the PDBT(E)BTz-d:IT-4F film exhibits some fibrillar-like structures. These results demonstrate that a better interpenetrating network can be formed in the PDBT(E)BTz-d:IT-4F blend film compared to the PDBT(E)BTz-p:IT-4F blend film. As is well known, the nanoscale networks are beneficial for charge generation and collection in devices, which may be responsible for the higher performance of the PDBT(E)BTz-d:IT-4F-based device relative to that of PDBT(E)BTz-d:IT-4F.
Conclusions
In conclusion, two regioisomeric WBG polymers PDBT(E)BTz-p and PDBT(E)BTz-d with deeper IP were designed and synthesized. The nitrogen topologies along the backbone have an important effect on the dihedral angle between ester-substituted thiophene and thiazole, resulting in the different chain conformations and optoelectronic properties of polymers. After blending with the electron acceptor IT-4F, the PDBT(E)BTz-p-based device delivered a PCE of 6.96% with a high VOC of 0.98 V, suggesting a low energy loss of only 0.55 eV, while the PDBT(E)BTz-d-based PSC device showed a higher PCE of 7.81% with a comparable VOC of 0.95 V and a slightly improved JSC and FF. The two polymers, as the third component in the host binary PBDB-T-SF:IT-4F system, enable PCE enhancement. With 5 wt% PDBT(E)BTz-d relative to PBDB-T-SF, the PCE improves from 12.1% to 13.4% for ternary devices. The low loading of the third component does not disturb the molecular packing in the ternary system, while at the same time, FRET between PDBT(E)BTz-d and PBDB-T-SF improves the device EQE (JSC) and leads to a slightly higher VOC, resulting in the PCE enhancement. This work shows that the newly designed WBG polymers featuring deeper IP can not only enhance the VOC of binary PSC devices, but can also act as a sensitizer to transfer energy through the FRET mechanism toward highly efficient ternary PSCs.
