    , Accepted 8th June 2011First published on 22nd July 2011AbstractWe herein describe our use of a water–ethylene method to prepare a composite material consisting of platinum nanoparticles and graphene. Results obtained using XPS and XRD show that the degree of reduction of graphene was increased by the incorporation of Pt, and in addition, the increased concentration of defects was confirmed by the D/G ratio of the Raman spectra obtained. In comparison with Pt films, results obtained using CV and EIS showed that the electrocatalytic ability of the composite material was greater, and afforded a higher charge transfer rate, an improved exchange current density, and a decreased internal resistance. SEM images showed that the morphology of PtNP/GR counter electrodes is characterized by a smooth surface, however, resulting in a lower resistance to diffusion, thereby improving the total redox reaction rate that occurs at the counter electrode. PtNP/GR electrodes have a number of advantages over other electrodes that consist solely of graphene or Pt films, including a high rate of charge transfer, a low internal resistance, and a low resistance to diffusion. In our study, we showed that DSSCs that incorporate platinum-grafted graphene had a conversion efficiency of 6.35%, which is 20% higher than that of devices with platinized FTO.
1. Introduction
Ever since the first demonstration of a dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) by O'Regan and Grätzel, this alternative photovoltaic system became a potentially attractive candidate for development, as a result of its low cost of fabrication and high energy conversion efficiency.1 The operational principle of DSSCs involves, the photo-induced oxidation of a dye molecule on a working TiO2 electrode, and the oxidized dye molecule is reduced by I− in the process. The oxidized species diffuses from the surface of the dye to the counter electrode and regenerates the I− with the help of a catalyst. Platinum (Pt) is a conventional catalyst for a DSSC, and induces an intense level of electrocatalytic activity for the iodide/triiodide pair. However, due to its scarcity and high cost, there is a need for decreasing the use of platinum for the counter electrode of DSSCs, even though Pt offers high electroreactivity and is highly stable.
A number of authors have shown that carbonaceous materials, such as carbon black,2–4carbon nanotubes,5–10graphite,11,12 and graphene,13–16 show promise as alternative catalyst materials to Pt. Among these alternatives, the two-dimensional carbon-based material graphene is perhaps the most attractive alternative to Pt, due to its high electrical conductivity and high specific surface area. Several authors have shown the correlation between the characterization of graphene and its electrochemical properties, especially in terms of its charge transfer resistance.13–16 Xu et al. demonstrated the use of soluble graphene as an electrocatalytic layer that can modify the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) counter electrode of a DSSC.13 They showed that, in comparison with unmodified FTO, the graphene significantly improved the performance of the counter electrode. Hasin and co-workers reported on the electrocatalytic activity of graphene in iodide/triiodide.14 They demonstrated that the graphene film obtained from chemical or thermal reduction exhibited various electrocatalytic properties. Roy-Mayhew et al. reported that a graphene sheet provides the catalytic and electrical properties as well as the flexibility to serve as a potential counter electrode.15 They showed that the performance of DSSCs was controlled by the C/O ratio of graphene following reduction by a thermal process. Kavanet al. demonstrated that the electrocatalytic properties of the graphene nanoplatelets that take part in a redox reaction are related to the concentration of defects and of oxygen-containing groups.16 According to a number of different studies in the available literature, defect-rich graphene appears to be a favored alternative material for use as a counter electrode, as a result of its high concentration of active sites and the hydrophilicity of its oxygen-containing groups. However, due to the electronic structure of graphene, a higher concentration of defects on the graphene results in a reduced electrical conductivity because of the contribution of decreased range of the delocalized π-electrons in graphene.17,18 A key aim is therefore to strike the appropriate balance between the electrical conductivity and the electrocatalytic properties of the graphene used. The conversion efficiency of DSSCs when graphene counter electrode is used is still lower than that of a Pt-based cell due to its internal resistance and the retardation of the electrolyte in carbon-based materials, even though graphene possesses significant electrocatalytic properties and a high specific surface area.
In the present study, we prepared a counter electrode by incorporating a composite material of platinum nanoparticles supported on graphene (PtNP/GR) coated on FTO. Synthesized using a water–ethylene glycol method,19 this material was cast on the FTO as a composite paste, thereby forming the desired PtNP/GR composite electrode. To our knowledge, the present paper is the first report on the use of PtNP/GR as a composite on the counter electrode of a DSSC. The characterization of the PtNP/GR was carried out using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectrophotometry (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). We also investigated the electrocatalytic properties of the PtNP/GR composite using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The mechanisms at play are herein explained by reference to the morphologies involved, which were studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It is herein shown that the performance of this composite electrode was better than that of conventional Pt-based and graphene-containing counter electrodes.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Preparation of graphene oxide, graphene, and PtNP/GR
The modified Hummers method20 was used to oxidize graphite flakes (98% purity, 325mesh, Alfar Aesar) in order to synthesize graphene oxide (GO). 10 g of graphite flakes were stirred for 7 days in a solution of 50 g potassium permanganate (KMnO4) in concentrated H2SO4 and HNO3 (the weight ratio of H2SO4 to HNO3 was 4:1), and were then reacted with H2O2 and washed with 5 wt% aqueous hydrochloric acid solution to complete the oxidation and remove the sulfate ions. The suspension was washed with deionized water and centrifuged repeatedly until the solution was neutral. The resulting brown powder was dried in vacuum at room temperature in order to obtain GO. In order to compare the electrocatalytic properties of the electrode with those of PtNP/GR, we obtained graphene from a chemical reduction using sodium borohydride (NaBH4). PtNP/GR composites were prepared using water–ethylene glycol method. A solution containing 10 mg GO and 10 ml of deionized water was dispersed by means of an ultrasonic horn for 5 min. Subsequently, a mixture containing 20 ml of ethylene glycol and 0.1 ml of 0.05 M H2PtCl6 aqueous solution was added to the solution with stirring for 1 h. This mixture was then heated at 120 °C for 6 h. The composite was washed and centrifuged with deionized water a total of six times, and the resulting black powder was then dried in vacuum at 40 °C.
2.2 Preparation of various counter electrodes and fabrication of DSSCs
The paste containing graphene and PtNP/GR was fabricated as follows. First, 85 wt% carbon materials, 10 wt% polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), and 5 wt% XC-72 were dispersed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) by using an ultrasonic horn for 1 h, thereby producing the carbon paste. The counter electrode with carbon materials was fabricated by solvent-casting in a vacuum at 120 °C overnight. Platinized counter electrodes with a thickness of 50 nm were prepared by using an E-gun evaporator (VTI-940503, Vactech) which equipped an oscillating quartz thickness controller (CRTM-5000, Ulvac) to monitor the thickness of Pt films on FTO glass.21 In order to prepare the DSSC photoanodes, a layer of paste was coated on fluorine-doped tin oxide glass (TEC-7, 7 Ω square−1, Hartford Glass Co., USA) plates. The coated electrodes were heated in air at 500 °C for 30 min. The thickness and active cell area of the TiO2 film were about 10 μm and 0.16 cm2, respectively. Prior to the fabrication of the DSSCs, the working electrodes were sensitized by soaking for 24 h in a 3 × 10−4 M solution of ruthenium dye (cis-dithiocyanato-N,N′-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4-carboxylic acid-4′-tetra-butylammonium carboxylate) ruthenium(II); N719, Solaronix SA, Switzerland) in acetonitrile/tert-butyl alcohol (v:v = 1:1). The sensitized electrodes were then immersed in acetonitrile for 12 hours. The DSSC was comprised of a sensitized working electrode, various counter electrodes and an electrolyte with a 60 μm thick hot-melt sealing foil (SX1170-60, Solaronix SA, Switzerland) between each layer. The electrolyte used in this study consisted of 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII), 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 0.03 M iodine, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile/valeronitrile (volume ratio: 85:15).22
2.3 Characterization of composite counter electrodes

X-Ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were conducted at room temperature at a scan rate of 2° min−1 using a Shimadzu XD-5 X-ray diffractor (40 kV, 30 mA, λ = 0.1542 nm) with a copper target and Ni filter. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out using a DuPont-TGA951 with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 in air. X-Ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were obtained using a PHI Quantera SXM/AES 650 Auger Electron Spectrometer (ULVAC-PHI INC., Japan) equipped with a hemispherical electron analyzer and a scanning monochromated Al Kα (hυ = 1486.6 eV) X-ray source. A small spot lens system allowed the analysis of samples with an area of less than 1 mm2. Raman spectra were recorded using a LabRam I confocal Raman spectrometer (Dilor, France). The excitation wavelength was 488 nm from a He–Ne laser with a laser power of ca. 15 mW at the surface of the sample. The morphology of the composite working electrodes was then studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4700I, Japan), and the microstructures of the carbon materials were also investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 2100F, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Cyclic voltammetric measurements were carried out using a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 302N, Autolab, Eco Chemie, Netherlands) in a three electrode configuration. Pt wire and an Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were obtained using the aforementioned potentiostat/galvanostat equipped with a Frequency Response Analysis (FRA) module. In the scan, the frequency ranged from 106 to 10−1 Hz, and used an applied voltage of 10 mV. Impedance spectra were analyzed using an equivalent circuit model with Autolab FRA software (v4.9, Eco Chemie B.V.). The photocurrent–voltage characteristics of the electrodes were also measured using a 2400 digital source meter (Keithley, USA) under illumination by a Class A sunlight simulator of 100 mW cm−2 (91160A, AM 1.5, Oriel, Newport Corporation, USA), which was equipped with an AM 1.5G filter (81088A, Oriel, Newport Corporation, USA) and a 300 W xenon lamp (6258, Oriel, Newport Corporation, USA). The intensity of the simulated incident light was calibrated up to 100 mW cm−2 using a reference Si solar cell, which was calibrated at NREL (USA).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Analysis of graphene oxide, graphene, PtNP/GR, and Pt films

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns for graphene oxide, graphene, PtNP/GR, and Pt films. In general, the graphite showed a significant (002) peak at 26.3° and a d-spacing of 0.34 nm.23 As the graphite was oxidized to GO, the (002) graphite peak was shifted to a lower angle of 10.68° with a d-spacing of 0.83 nm. The large interlayer distance of the GO was attributed to the presence of hydroxyl, epoxy, and carboxyl groups. In the present study, the common reducing agent NaBH4 was used to reduce GO to graphene. Following the reduction, the sharp peak (002) of GO disappeared and the 002 peak may be seen at 24.2° with an interlayer distance of 0.37 nm, indicating that the graphene removed some of the oxygen-contained functional groups. The XRD pattern of the PtNP/GR composite shows that the Pt metals were formed after a reducing reaction with the water–ethylene glycol solution. In addition, the peaks of the composite at 2θ = 40°, 46.54°, 67°, 81.46° may be respectively assigned to the (111), (200), (220), and (311) crystalline plane of Pt, which is consistent with the XRD pattern of Pt films. Interestingly, there are no obvious peaks of graphene oxide or graphite to be seen in the XRD pattern of PtNP/GR. This finding could perhaps be attributed to the high catalytic activity of the Pt nanoparticles, which enhanced the reducing power of ethylene glycol and caused the extension of the aromatic domain on the graphene.18

In the present study, we focused on the surface composition of GO, graphene, and PtNP/GR, and used this to try to explain the correlation with the performance of each material by obtaining the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) in each case. Fig. 2 shows the C1s peak of GO, graphene, and PtNP/GR, indicating the functional groups and composition of the structure, including the aromatic CC and aliphatic C–C, hydroxyl carbon C–O, epoxy carbon C–O–C, carbonyl carbon CO and carboxyl carbon C(O)O groups.18 The areas of the contributing peaks are summarized in Table 1. The C1s core level spectra of GO shows a high degree of oxidation, which consists of three main components assigned to the C–O–C (epoxy, 286.6 eV), C–C (sp3carbon, 284.8 eV), and CC (sp2carbon, 284.3 eV) groups and three minor components assigned to the C–O (hydroxyl, 286.1 eV), CO (carbonyl, 287.4 eV), and C(O)O (carboxyl, 288.7 eV) groups. Following reduction by NaBH4, the spectra of graphene demonstrated that the C–O–C groups were almost entirely removed and transformed into C–O groups, while some of the carbonyl and carboxyl groups were also removed. The percentage of CC groups was increased because of the increased extent of the aromatic domain, as seen in the appearance of the π–π* satellite peak at 291.0 eV, which reflected the delocalization of the π-electrons in the aromatic network in graphite. The XPS spectra of PtNP/GR showed that the percentage of the C–O–C groups was lower than in graphene, indicating that the more epoxy groups were transformed into C–O groups by incorporation of high catalytic Pt metals. Interestingly, the increased percentage of CC groups points to the repair of the structure on the basal plane of graphene, further implying that the reduction in a number of oxygen-containing groups attributed to the d-spacing of graphene, which is consistent with results seen in the XRD data. This result may be attributed to the enhancement of the reducing ability of the water–ethylene glycol solution as this affects GO, through the action of the highly catalytic properties of Pt nanoparticles (NPs) as a result of the improved connection of the isolated aromatic domains. In addition, a slight decrease in the number of hydroxyl groups could be at least partially caused by the chemical bonding of the Pt NPs. In order to identify the chemical bonding between the Pt NPs and graphene, we used the XRD spectra of Pt4f to help explain the correlations, which are shown in Fig. 3 and listed in Table 2. The XPS spectra of Pt4f are characterized by three pairs of doublets with low binding energies of 71.2 eV, 72.6 eV, and 74.63 eV.24 The major peaks at 71.2 eV and 74.55 eV may be assigned to the zero valence state of Pt metals, and in addition, the peak at 74.55 eV may be attributed to the interaction between the Pt NPs and the graphene support.25 The doublets at 71.9 eV and 75.5 eV may be attributed to Pt(II) species, indicating the amorphous state, and the broad doublets at 76.4 eV and 77.9 eV may be assigned to Pt(IV) species. This result shows that the metallic Pt was reduced on the graphene due to the percentage of zero-valence state of Pt (53.5%). According to the large decreased C–O–C groups, it is a rational reason that the C–O–C groups transformed into C–O groups, thus forming Pt(II) and Pt(IV) groups. Based on the distribution of oxygen-contained groups on graphene, the Pt(II) groups may occur on the edge plane or basal plane of graphene, and the Pt(IV) groups may exist at the two-isolated aromatic domain of graphene. However, the C–O groups of PtNP/GR are slightly smaller than those of graphene. Due to the high catalytic properties, it was supposed that the decreased C–O groups may be transformed into the CC groups compared to the graphene reduced by NaBH4.

Raman spectroscopy is an effective tool for investigating the structural variations that occur in carbonaceous materials because it shows both the D band (∼1345 cm−1, breathing mode of A1g) and the G band (the in-plane bond-stretching motion of pairs of C sp2 atoms, E2g mode).26–28Fig. 4 shows the position of the various peaks of the two bands and the differences in the D/G ratios for various different carbonaceous materials. An increase in the D/G ratio is generally the result of (a) an increase in the amount of amorphous carbon, (b) a higher defect density, or (c) a decrease in the crystalline size.14 In our case, the increased D/G ratio of chemical-reduced graphene may be due to the high density of the defects on the structure of the graphene, which is consistent with the C/O ratio seen in the XPS results. It is reasonable to assume that this trend is similar to that of the D/G ratio of PtNP/GR. However, this finding seems to be in contrast with the general belief that an increased percentage of CC groups should be reflected in a decrease in the D/G ratio due to the increased extension of the delocalized π-electrons.17,27 According to XPS spectra of Pt4f, the metallic Pt particles were bonded to the surface of graphene through the assistance of Pt(II) and Pt(IV) groups, which were present on the edge and on the basal plane of graphene. As a result of these factors, the range of the aromatic domains on the graphene was extended, its electrical conductivity was improved, and the electrocatalytic properties of the graphene were retained.
 Fig. 4  
Raman spectra of GO, graphene, and PtNP/GR with the corresponding D/G ratios. 
The morphology of carbonaceous materials was investigated using TEM to observe the differences between GO, graphene, and PtNP/GR. Fig. 5(a) shows that morphology of GO is characterized by an even surface with a slight wrinkle and an area with a dimension of 5.85 μm × 6.75 μm. Following reduction by NaBH4, Fig. 5(b) shows a morphology with a wrinkled, rough surface with small dimensions, which may be attributed to the stacking of several different pieces of graphene due to the strong π–π staking interaction on the surface of the graphene. In contrast, Fig. 5(c) shows that the morphology of PtNP/GR is characterized by a surface that is less wrinkled, which was grafted with Pt particles of size 4–7 nm. The slight aggregation of the Pt particles may be attributed to the pH of the Pt precursor. In addition, the TEM image shows the fewer layers in the graphene, indicating an increased dispersion due to the inhibition of the π–π interactions within the graphene. Furthermore, the quantity of Pt metal on the graphene was investigated using TGA. The as-prepared materials were heated at 100 °C for 5 min in order to remove the adsorbed water. Fig. 5(d) shows the thermal behavior of GO, graphene, and PtNP/GR. The main weight loss of GO occurred at 200 °C–300 °C due to the decomposition of the oxygen-containing functional groups to CO, CO2, and H2O. Thus, the degradation of GO at 300 °C–800 °C may be associated with the removal of other oxygen moieties that are more thermally stable, together with the thermal decomposition of graphite oxide. In contrast to GO, the thermal analysis of graphene and PtNP/GR demonstrates behavior that is more thermal stable. The weight loss of 20 wt% below 450 °C reflects the presence of residual oxygen-containing functional groups or water absorbed on graphene. The weight loss that occurs at 450–600 °C, may be attributed to the thermal decomposition of graphene. Hence, the residue is calculated to be 15 wt%, which is assigned to the presence of Pt metals on the graphene.

The foregoing results show that the graphene and PtNP/GR both possess oxygen-containing functional groups, and furthermore, the XPS results related to graphene have demonstrated the considerable percentage of sp2carbon. The electrical conductivity and the electrocatalytic properties of graphene were thus improved. In contrast, the PtNP/GR contained a higher amount of sp2carbon as a result of the Pt particles that were grafted between the nano-scale aromatic domains. As a result of the favorable electrocatalytic properties of graphene and PtNP/GR, including their oxygen-containing functional groups, their high percentage of sp2carbon, and their concentrations of defects, we next used these materials to investigate the electrochemical properties of the electrolyte containing Fe2+/Fe3+ and I−/I3−.
3.2 Analysis of the electrochemical properties and cell performance of Pt films, graphene, and PtNP/GR electrodes

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is a powerful and efficient method of analyzing the catalytic mechanisms that occur in an electrochemical system. We herein used two types of electrolyte, including (1) single electron transfer media (Fe2+/Fe3+) and (2) two electron transfer media (I−/I3−), in order to investigate the electrocatalytic properties of a number of carbonaceous materials. Fig. 6(a) shows the CV results obtained from Pt films, graphene, and PtNP/GR in aqueous solutions containing 6 mM K3Fe(CN)6 and 1 M KNO3. According to the literature,29,30 the value of peak separation (ΔEp) is related to the electron transfer rate, with a higher electron transfer rate (k) being associated with lower ΔEp value. The ΔEp is 159 mV for Pt films and 110 mV for graphene. This result indicates that the electron transfer rate of graphene is higher than that of Pt films, which may be attributed to the high concentration of defects and the hydrophilicity of the oxygen-containing graphene. In addition, the exchange current density of graphene is higher than that of the Pt films due to its larger specific surface area. Furthermore, the electron transfer rate and exchange current density of PtNP/GR is higher than that of other materials due to its lowest ΔEp value (80 mV). In contrast to Pt films, the PtNP/GR possesses a higher specific surface area and hydrophilicity, and therefore shows enhanced electrocatalytic properties. In order to simulate the conditions of the redox reaction of the iodide ions at the counter electrode of DSSC, a solution containing iodide/triiodide was used to perform the CV measurements, as shown in Fig. 6(b). In the case of the platinized FTO electrode, two groups of redox peaks can be seen. The middle peaks may be attributed to eqn (1) (below) and the peaks on the right may be assigned to eqn (2).11,31,32 The peaks on the left are probably partially caused by the moisture present in the carbon materials. 3I− ↔ I3− + 2e−(1) 2I3− ↔ 3I2 + 2e−(2)

According to the CV results for the graphene and PtNP/GR electrodes, the carbon electrodes exhibit a high current density in the middle peaks due to their high specific surface area. In addition, the PtNP/GR electrode exhibited a higher current density than the other electrodes due to its high specific surface area and high concentration of defects. Interestingly, the right-hand peaks of the PtNP/GR electrode that were attributed to eqn (2) showed a similar current density to that of the graphene electrode, implying that the reaction of eqn (2) was maintained even though it incorporated the highly catalytic metal. In addition, compared to graphene (417 mV), the similar ΔEp were presented in the middle peaks of Pt films (342 mV) and PtNP/GR (350 mV), it shows that the electrocatalytic properties of graphene were enhanced by the incorporation of Pt metals, even though graphene exhibits the low charge transfer rate. The CV results show that the use of carbonaceous materials as a counter electrode in DSSCs yields a marked improvement in their properties compared to that of DSSCs that use a platinized FTO, due to the remarkable electrocatalytic ability of the carbonaceous materials. In order to investigate the operation of a real DSSC device, we next used electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) to characterize the charge transfer behavior and diffusion resistance.
Recently, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has been used to analyze the kinetic behavior of counter electrodes for DSSCs.14–16 In general, the impedance spectra of counter electrodes for DSSCs form two semicircles, which represent the two different steps of the reaction in the electrochemical process, namely the charge transfer at the Pt/electrolyte interface, and the diffusion of I−/I3− ions in the electrolyte. The charge transfer resistance (RCT) is correlated with the exchange current density (J0), while the triiodide is reduced to iodide at the counter electrode.14,16 The exchange current density is calculated from the charge transfer resistance using eqn (3) as follows:33 (3)where R, T, n, and F is represent the gas constant, temperature, the numbers of electrons transferred in the reduction reaction, and the Faraday constant, respectively.
The Nyquist plots of various symmetrical devices fabricated using carbonaceous electrodes are shown in Fig. 7, which also show the equivalent circuit used for fitting the EIS spectra. The semicircle on the left at high-frequency corresponds to the charge transfer process, and the semicircle on the right at low-frequency may be attributed to the diffusion of iodide/triiodide in the electrolyte. The charge transfer resistance of graphene is lower than that of Pt films. This finding implies that the charge transfer process on the surface of graphene is faster than it is on Pt films as a result of the higher exchange current density, in agreement with the CV results. Due to the high concentration of defects and the electrical conductivity, the charge transfer behavior of chemically reduced graphene was improved, indicating its potential as an alternative to the Pt catalyst. However, the diffusion resistance of the graphene electrode was dramatically higher than that of the Pt films, indicating that the microstructure of the graphene electrode suppresses the diffusivity of redox species.15 Due to the high degree of π–π interaction of the graphene sheets, graphene may be seen to have a stacked morphology that is characterized by a significant degree of aggregation, which leads to the formation of small pores in the graphene electrode. In contrast to graphene, the PtNP/GR electrode showed a smaller charge transfer resistance and considerable resistance to diffusion. Because Pt NPs were grafted to the surface of the graphene, the dispersive ability of the graphene sheets was improved,19 and furthermore, the redox ions may be easily transferred within the composite sheets due to the size of the Pt particles. Hence, the diffusion resistance of PtNP/GR was decreased. The low charge transfer resistance caused the device to respond more quickly due to the improved electrocatalytic properties and electrical conductivity, implying an improved reduction ability for iodide/triiodide. Furthermore, the value of the series resistance was similar to other electrodes. The EIS results are summarized in Table 3.

Fig. 8 shows the morphology of graphene, PtNP/GR and Pt films, and provides some evidence to explain the differences in their diffusion resistance. Due to the strength of the π–π interaction within graphene, its morphology may be seen as a stacked surface with small pores, which indicated that I− may not easily be transferred in the limited channels of the microstructure, thus increasing the internal resistance of the counter electrode, even though the graphene had the higher rate of charge transfer. Compared with graphene, the PtNP/GR electrode showed a smooth surface. However, this result is opposite to the general belief that low diffusion resistance may occur in the free channel in the counter electrode, which resulted in low internal resistance. It was supposed that the redox species performed redox reactions in the interlayered PtNP/GR sheets due to the size of grafted Pt particles (4–7 nm) as shown in Fig. 5c and d. All the foregoing results were consistent with TEM, CV and EIS measurements, and show that the PtNP/GR electrode possesses the more favorable electrocatalytic properties for use as a potential catalytic material compared to Pt films, thereby reducing the need for the use of the platinum in counter electrodes.

3.3 The performance of DSSCs using various working electrodes
The cell performance of the DSSCs was measured using simulated sunlight (1 Sun AM 1.5). Fig. 9 and Table 4 show the characteristics of DSSCs fabricated using various different counter electrodes. Under illumination, the DSSC with the PtNP/GR counter electrode exhibited a short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) of 12.06 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.79 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.67, yielding a conversion efficiency (η) of 6.35%. For the DSSC with the graphene counter electrode and fabricated using exactly the same method, the values of Voc, Jsc, FF and η were 0.78 V, 11.59 mA cm−2, 0.32 and 2.89%, respectively. The PtNP/GR counter electrode therefore showed a marked improvement in FF compared with the graphene counter electrode, and in photocurrent compared with the platinized FTO. The high specific surface area and improved electrocatalytic properties afforded by the Pt-grafted graphene, led to an improved cell performance and a decrease in the resistance to charge transport in the DSSC devices concerned. The observed impedance also indicated that the low RCT and low diffusion resistance led to an increase in FF as a result of the decreased internal resistance of the device. Interestingly, the FF of the DSSC prepared using the graphene counter electrode was lower than that of the DSSC prepared using a pristine Pt film counter electrode. This may have been the result of the poor diffusion rate of the redox species in the small pores of the graphene, which could have led to an increased internal resistance. The FF result for the graphene counter electrode seems to be correlated with the results of the dark current measurements. During the measurements, the transfer of electrons occurred at the TiO2 matrix–electrolyte interface, the redox species were trapped in the bulk graphene counter electrode, and thus the dark current was observed at a higher applied voltage than for the platinized FTO and PtNP/GR counter electrodes. The results for the composite counter electrode show that the improved Voc is a result of the decrease in the Fermi level of the redox species.11,32 The DSSCs fabricated using the PtNP/GR counter electrode showed a comparable improvement in performance compared with those fabricated using the platinized counter electrode, providing a 13% increase in photocurrent and 20% improvement in conversion efficiency. By combining the advantages of Pt and graphene, we achieved both a high charge transfer rate and a high specific surface area at the interface, thereby producing the high performance observed in these experiments.

The incorporation of PtNP/GR materials has been shown to increase the charge transfer rate, decrease the internal resistance as a result of the favorable electrocatalytic properties of Pt nanoparticles, and decrease the diffusion resistance in the composite counter electrode. The use of PtNP/GR composite as counter electrodes in DSSCs clearly warrants further investigation.
4. Conclusions
We have described a composite material that can be used to improve the electrochemical characteristics of chemically reduced graphene through the incorporation of Pt nanoparticles. Results obtained from XPS and Raman spectra support our contention that the electronic structure and the concentration of defects in graphene can be improved by grafting it to Pt metal. Furthermore, the use of graphene has been shown to improve the electrocatalytic properties and exchange current density, as seen in the results of CV and EIS, thereby improving the electron transfer rate at the interface. The photocurrent density of DSSCs that used a PtNP/GR counter electrode was increased by 13% and the conversion efficiency was increased by 20%, compared with DSSCs that used a platinized FTO. This was a result of the increased charge transfer rate and reduced internal resistance that resulted from the incorporation of a PtNP/GR composite. Our findings show that platinum-grafted graphene composite materials possess great potential for applications related to DSSCs, and merit further investigation.
