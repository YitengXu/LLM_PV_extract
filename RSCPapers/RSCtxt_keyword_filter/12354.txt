    , Accepted 26th March 2020First published on 26th March 2020AbstractElectrocatalytic conversion of CO2 into hydrocarbons is one of the most promising approaches to reduce the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere as well as to produce various valuable chemical products from this most prevalent greenhouse gas. However, this process is still many steps away from finding practical application because of its high energy demand. Herein we report an innovative CO2/H2 fuel cell that can convert CO2 into a synthetic fuel (CH4) while generating electricity instead of consuming it. This is unlike conventional electrochemical CO2 reduction cells, which typically consume electricity to reduce CO2. In the new cell, H2 is oxidized to H+ ions (and electrons) at the anode, and the H+ ions then pass through a proton exchange membrane to reduce CO2 to CH4 at the cathode. While doing so, the cell can generate a current density of 94.1 A m−2, a peak power density of 3.9 W m−2 and CH4 at a rate of 75.29 μmol gcat−1 h−1 at 170 °C, a temperature that can be derived from waste heat from various processes. Density functional theory is applied to determine the reaction mechanism on the catalyst in the cell.
Introduction
The level of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), which has recently surpassed 400 ppm for the first time in recorded history,1–3 is still rising due to the continued, extensive use of fossil fuels around the globe. This, in turn, is leading to adverse and potentially irreversible climate change, such as global warming, sea level rise, coral reef damage and glacier retreat. Therefore, a great deal of effort is being made around the world to convert CO2 into useful chemical products and reduce the amount of CO2 going to the atmosphere. However, CO2 is a quite stable molecule, and its CO bonds possess a high dissociation energy of 750 kJ mol−1.4 Therefore, energy has to be supplied in some form such as electricity or solar energy to activate its bonds and convert it into products such as methanol (CH3OH), methane (CH4) and formic acid (HCOOH), (i.e., into useful chemical feedstocks and synthetic fuels).
Electrochemical activation is one of the most promising strategies to convert CO2 to carbon monoxide (CO), CH3OH, CH4, etc. However, in this process, a large amount of electrical energy has to be applied to drive the reaction, even in the presence of catalysts. For instance, the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CH4 over copper (Cu),5 iron (Fe)6 and silver (Ag)6 catalysts, which are widely investigated for this reaction, needs overpotentials (energy inputs) of −0.90 V, −0.53 V and −1.22 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), respectively. Even one of the best CO2 reduction electrocatalysts, four-atom-thick layered cobalt (Co), requires an overpotential of −0.24 V versus the RHE to convert CO2 into formate.7 Hence, the development of more efficient electrocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) at lower overpotentials remains an important goal in energy research.
Photocatalytic conversion is the second promising strategy to transform CO2 into synthetic fuels and valuable chemicals.8,9 However, this process also suffers from low efficiency and relatively low rates of CO2 conversion even with good photocatalysts.10,11 For example, the rate of production of CH4 by the CO2RR over mesoporous single crystals of a reduced TiO2−x photocatalyst is only 1.63 μmol gcat−1 h−1 (ref. 11) and that over a Pd7Cu1-TiO2 photocatalyst is only 19.6 μmol gcat−1 h−1.12 This is mainly due to the sluggish separation and transfer kinetics of the electron–hole pairs formed over these photocatalysts.13 In another approach, Yang's group demonstrated an artificial photocatalytic system comprising CdS nanoparticles and Moorella thermoacetica bacteria for the CO2RR.14 In this photocatalyst, the bacteria served as acceptors of photogenerated electrons from the CdS nanoparticles, facilitating the reduction of CO2 to acetic acid, giving the product with a yield of 90% and a quantum efficiency of 85 ± 12%.
Another commonly considered strategy to address the issue of atmospheric CO2 involves thermochemical hydrogenation of CO2 into hydrocarbons, CO, alcohols, aldehydes, etc. using various thermocatalysts. This process, however, often requires a relatively high temperature and/or pressure (or high energy) and consumes H2. Thus, research to develop more efficient CO2 hydrogenation thermocatalysts that can do the job at low temperature and pressure while giving the desired products in high yields is also ongoing.15,16
Inspired by previous studies on fuel cells,17–21 herein, we demonstrate a novel CO2/H2 fuel cell that converts CO2 into a hydrocarbon product while also producing electricity, instead of consuming it like typical electrochemical CO2 reduction cells do. Furthermore, compared with previously reported traditional CO2 reducing systems or fuel cells, this CO2/H2 fuel cell has the following unique or notable advantages: (i) it does not need an electrical energy input to operate (unlike conventional electrochemical cells, which do); (ii) it can deliver electricity (compared with traditional thermochemical CO2 hydrogenation systems which do), and the electricity (generated with cell stacks) can, in principle, be used to produce H2 for this new cell to use via water electrolysis; and (iii) it produces hydrocarbon products while generating electrical energy (cf. traditional fuel cells cannot do both).22,23 Moreover, the cell operates better at a relatively higher temperature; thus, it can be uniquely suited as an energy conversion system in thermal power plants, cement factories, steel plants, etc., where high CO2 emission as well as exhaust heat at moderate temperature is a common feature. To the best of our knowledge, such a cell, which can simultaneously realize the reduction of CO2 and the production of electricity at the expense of only some heat, has not been reported before. Density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations are also performed to unravel the reaction mechanism leading to the reduction of CO2 on the catalysts deployed in the cell.
Results and discussion
Assembly of the CO2/H2 cell and characterization of catalysts
The CO2/H2 fuel cell comprises a membrane electrode assembly (MEA), as shown in Fig. 1a. The detailed preparation procedure of the MEA can be found in Fig. S1 (ESI†). In the cell, carbon nanotube-supported RuO2 nanoparticles (RuO2/CNTs) and Pt/C (40 wt%) are used as cathode and anode catalysts, respectively. Unlike in many conventional fuel cells, where O2 is commonly used as an oxidant at the cathode, in this cell CO2 is used as an oxidant. Although its detailed structure looks like that of a standard cell or like the one we have reported recently,19 the use of CO2 at the cathode presents a key difference. In the cell, a more thermally stable polymer, phosphoric acid-treated-polybenzimidazole (PA-PBI) (see the section “Preparation of electrodes” for details) is used as a proton exchange membrane (PEM), in lieu of other common polymer membranes, such as Nafion.24 As depicted in Fig. 1b, the cell involves three consecutive processes to operate: (a) the oxidation of H2 to H+ ions with a release of two electrons at the anode electrode, (b) the transfer of the H+ ions from the anode electrode to the cathode electrode through the PA-PBI membrane, and (c) the reduction of CO2 at the cathode with the H+ ions coming through PA-PBI and electrons coming via the external circuit. The possible reactions and products at both electrodes are given in eqn (1)–(6) below.25–27 The reactions can ultimately result in the reduction of CO2 to either C, hydrocarbons or oxygenated hydrocarbons as well as the production of electricity.

There are more possible reactions, but we only presented those that possess positive voltages and that can proceed naturally if they are provided with H+ ions and electrons. The catalyst used at the cathode in the cell is comprised of RuO2/CNTs. This catalyst is chosen because of its excellent performances for various electrochemical reduction reactions.28,29 The transmission electron microscope (TEM) image (Fig. 1c) displays uniformly dispersed RuO2 nanoparticles over the CNTs. The size distribution of the particles, which is shown in Fig. 1d, reveals that the particles have sizes in the range of 2–11 nm and an average diameter of ca. 5 nm. In line with the TEM result, the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image (Fig. S2a, ESI†) shows that the catalyst consists of RuO2 nanoparticles that are ≤10 nm in size and that are uniformly distributed over the surfaces of the CNTs. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images (Fig. 1e and f) of the catalyst display lattice fringe spacings of 0.218 nm and 0.224 nm corresponding to the (111) and (200) planes of RuO2, with a 60° angle in between them.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the catalyst (Fig. S2b, ESI†) shows peaks that match well with those of RuO2 (JCPDS no. 43-1027). Two diffraction peaks centered at 2θ of 24.6° and 43.6° that can be indexed as the graphitic planes of graphitic carbon (JCPDS: 89-8487) are also seen. The elemental mapping images obtained for the catalyst by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) reveal the existence of Ru, O and C in it (Fig. S2c–f, ESI†). The survey spectrum obtained by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of RuO2/CNTs (Fig. S3a, ESI†) shows peaks corresponding to Ru 3d and O 1s. High-resolution XPS peaks corresponding to Ru 3d and O 1s are further displayed in Fig. S3b and c (ESI†), respectively. The spectra of Ru 3d3/2 and C 1s show overlapping peaks at a binding energy of ca. 285 eV, as previously reported.28 The peak at 280.8 eV corresponding to Ru 3d5/2 is used to identify the electronic states of Ru in the catalyst and the successful deposition of RuO2 onto the CNTs. Fig. S3c (ESI†) shows the XPS spectrum of O 1s with discrete peaks of Ru–O–Ru at 529.5 eV and Ru–O–H at 530.5 eV and a peak at 531.6 eV corresponding to C–O or surface oxygenated groups. The results, as a whole, indicate the successful synthesis of RuO2/CNTs.
Cell performance and identification of the CO2 reduction products
The performance of the cell under different conditions is then evaluated. Before each test, N2 is purged into both the anode and cathode compartments of the cell to make sure that O2, even in a trace amount, is not present and does not affect the reaction in the cell. After CO2 is supplied to the cathode and H2 is supplied to the anode, the reduction of CO2 over the RuO2/CNTs catalyst begins. As depicted in Fig. 2a, under open circuit conditions, there is a cell voltage of ca. 0.165 V, whose value changes slightly at different temperatures; this value matches well with the standard potential of the reaction given in eqn (4) or with the reaction there. Based on the current density and power density produced by the cell under different conditions, the activity of the cell is then assessed. As shown in Fig. 2a, it is obvious that the performance of the cell increases as the temperature around it is increased. For example, the current density and peak power density of the cell are 70.9 A m−2 and 2.4 W m−2, respectively, at 80 °C, but they both increase to 94.1 A m−2 and 3.9 W m−2, respectively, at 170 °C (Fig. 2b).

(a) and (b) The performances of the cell containing the RuO2/CNTs catalyst at the cathode and the Pt/C (40 wt%) catalyst at the anode in the CO2RR at different working temperatures. (c) Gas chromatograms and peaks observed with a flame ionization detector (FID) of the products when the cell is operated at different temperatures. (d) Gas chromatogram obtained with a FID of the products while the cell is discharging at different current densities at 170 °C. The inset displays the mass-spectra of CH4 (m/z = 16) produced by the cell. 
To gain further insights into the changes of the cell performance at different temperatures, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out in a frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz at different working temperatures (Fig. S4, ESI†). Based on the EIS measurements (detailed analysis can be found in the ESI†), both bulk resistance and charge transfer resistance are significantly lower at higher temperatures. This is most likely because the PBI membrane has a higher proton conductivity at higher temperatures.30,31 Thus, better cell performances can be expected at higher cell working temperatures. The EIS values at different temperatures are in line with the current densities and peak power densities of the cell depicted in Fig. 2a.
To verify the origin of the current, the gases flowing from the outlet at the cathode of the cell are measured by gas chromatography (GC) using different detectors. The results show that CH4 (Fig. 2c) and H2 (Fig. S5, ESI†) are the major gases exiting the outlet. As displayed in Fig. 2c, the peak associated with CH4 becomes higher as the cell is run at a higher temperature. Since the higher peak represents a larger amount of the CH4 product, it can be said that the cell produces more CH4 at higher operating temperatures. This result also indicates that CH4 originates as a result of CO2 reduction in the cell and that its rate of formation increases at higher temperatures. To confirm if the production of CH4 is exclusively related to the reduction of CO2 in the cell, a set of experiments involving cell discharge at different current densities is carried out (Fig. 2d). The results show that the current density increases commensurate with the amount of CH4, indicating that the rate of charge (or electron) transfer in the cell is directly related to the CH4 product. The mass spectrum, displayed in the inset in Fig. 2d, depicts a peak at m/z = 16, also demonstrating the presence of CH4 in the product. Besides, a major peak corresponding to H2 is observed with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) (Fig. S5, ESI†). This must be due to the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) or the reduction of H+ ions to H2, just like what occurs in the H+-ion concentration cell we recently reported.32 This is not surprising, as the HER is a common occurrence in many electrochemical CO2RR cells and it competes with the CO2RR.33,34 It should, however, be noted that the HER taking place in the CO2/H2 cell reported here contributes to the current generated by the cell and that it can be driven only by waste heat, just like in our recent report.32 What is even more important is that, despite its competitiveness, the HER in the cell here leads to waste heat-derived electricity that contributes to the energy required to overcome the inherent overpotential of the CO2RR. The rate of production of CH4 in this single cell (working at 170 °C), which is calculated as described in the ESI,† is 66.25 μmol gcat−1 h−1. This is obtained when RuO2/CNTs are used as the CO2RR catalyst and Pt/C is used as the anode catalyst in the cell, with a CO2 flow rate of 308 mL min−1 and at a discharging current of 120 mA. The contribution to current by the CO2RR to the total current (η), which is calculated as outlined in the ESI,† is found to be 1.18% for the single cell.
Control experiments to confirm the origin of CH4
It is important to examine whether or not the hydrocarbon product (i.e., CH4) observed by GC is not the result of processes other than the reduction of CO2 in the cell. To rule out any other possibility, a series of control experiments were conducted. First, N2 was purged into both the cathode and anode compartments of the cell, and then whether or not CH4 originated from the components of the cell, such as sealing gaskets and the membrane, is checked. The gases coming out of the outlet of the cathode were measured using both FID and TCD. In the experiments, neither CH4 nor H2 is detected, as can be seen in Fig. S6a and b (ESI†), confirming that the obtained CH4 is not the product of any of the hardware components of the cell. Second, when the cell is set to run in an open circuit voltage (OCV) state and then CO2 and H2 are purged into its cathode and anode compartments, respectively, no CH4 or H2 is detected in the gas flowing out of the cathode compartment of the cell (Fig. S7a and b, ESI†). This implies that there is no possible CH4 impurity in the CO2 used for the reaction in the cell and also that no process other than CO2 reduction is responsible for the observed CH4 in the outlet. The above experiments and results confirm that CH4 forms exclusively from the reduction of CO2 in the cell. Thus, we can conclude that eqn (4) takes place in this system. The Gibbs free energy (ΔG) of the reaction is calculated based on HSC chemistry software (Fig. S8, ESI†) and obtained as −86.68 kJ at 170 °C when the water is in a gas form, reflecting this reaction can happen naturally. The result indicates that CH4 generation is feasible from a thermodynamics point of view. Thus, this system can not only reduce CO2 and form CH4 without external electrical energy, but it actually generates electricity in the end.
To gain some insight into whether or not RuO2 would be reduced to Ru under the operating conditions of the cell and also to explore if CNT-supported Ru nanoparticles can do the job, Ru/CNTs are synthesized and tested in the same manner. Their synthesis and characterization can be found in the Experimental section. In Fig. S9a–c (ESI†), their XRD pattern and SEM image are displayed. As can be seen in Fig. S10a (ESI†), at the outset, the catalytic performance of Ru/CNTs appears to be better than that of RuO2/CNTs, as the former gives a current density of 115 A m−2 and a peak density of 5 W m−2 at 170 °C. However, the amount of CH4 produced by the former is very small, with its amount increasing only a little bit as the operating temperature is increased (Fig. S10b, ESI†). Meanwhile, the amount of H2 coming out of the cathode is greater and increases commensurate with the current density, as displayed in Fig. S10c and d (ESI†). This indicates that the Ru/CNTs at the cathode make the cell operate more like a H+-ion concentration cell, rather than a CO2RR cell.
Mechanism of the CO2RR over RuO2/CNTs leading to CH4 studied with DFT calculations
To determine the detailed mechanism leading to CO2 reduction over the RuO2/CNTs and the fate of CO2 in the cell, density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations are performed using a computational hydrogen electrode model,35 which is described in detail in the ESI.† First, the most stable surface termination of the catalyst at relevant potentials is unravelled using ab initio thermodynamics.36 The surface energy of the different surface terminations with respect to the potential at the cathode is illustrated in Fig. 3a. (Note that in the system, the potential is boosted by the fuel cell itself, instead of an outside electrical energy input.) Then, the surface termination in a high potential range, labeled as H–RuO–O–R, is introduced. The corresponding structure is shown in Fig. 3b. In this surface termination, the coordination of the unsaturated surface Ru site is bare, whereas the four-fold bridged Ru site is occupied by an adsorbed H atom.

(b) The structure and surface termination of the catalyst in a high overpotential range. (c) Most plausible calculated reaction pathway for CO2 reduction over the catalyst in the cell. 
The most preferable reaction pathway for the CO2RR starting from CO2 over the catalyst is shown in Fig. 3c. First, H is transferred to a C atom in CO2 and generates OCHO* rather than COOH* as an intermediate. Then, the OCHO* is hydrogenated to form HCOOH* and then H2COOH*. Upon further hydrogenation, H2COOH* is dissociated into H3CO* and OH*. The free energy of protonation of *H3CO to produce CH3OH is 0.76 eV higher than that of *H3CO to produce O* and CH4. This suggests that CH4 would be a more favorable final product than CH3OH. These theoretical results are in full agreement with the experimental findings described earlier. The potential-determining step is OCHO* hydrogenation to HCOOH*, and it has a free energy of 0.85 eV. This energy barrier can be overcome by the thermodynamic driving force of the fuel cell itself. It is worth noting that the free energy of formation of the CO* intermediate, where COOH* acts as a relevant intermediate, is 0.78 eV higher than the free energy of formation of the OCHO* intermediate; thus, CO is less likely to occupy the surface-active Ru site, corroborating the effectiveness of the model selected for our computational studies.
Increasing the yield of CH4 from the CO2RR using a cell-stack structure
To increase the yield of CH4, a cell-stack, in which three cells are placed in series, as shown in Fig. 4a, is designed and assembled. Compared with a single cell, the cell stack ensures that the CO2 gas goes through a longer path, allowing CO2 more chance to undergo the CO2RR and thus giving more CH4. In this assembly, the unreacted CO2 gas from the first cell can get into the second cell to undergo reduction, and any residual CO2 can still go to the third cell and have another chance to undergo reduction. The gas at the outlet, after the three cells, is collected and injected into the GC equipped with a FID, and the amount of the CH4 product in it is measured. As displayed in Fig. 4b, at 170 °C the open cell voltage can reach 0.41 V and the peak power can reach 9.6 mW for this cell-stack (Fig. 4c), whose cells have an effective reaction area of 16 cm2 each. The values of the cell voltage and peak power are both higher than those obtained for a single cell. Moreover, compared with the single cell, the yield of CH4 from the cell-stack is substantially higher at the same operating temperature; for instance, while the single cell affords 8 ppm (at a flow rate of 308 mL min−1 and at a discharge current of 120 mA) of CH4 at 170 °C, the cell-stack produces 105 ppm (at a flow rate of 80 mL min−1 and at a discharge current of 148 mA) of CH4 (Fig. 4d). The results also reveal that the contribution of the CO2RR to the total current (η) increases from 1.18% for the single cell to 3.36% for the cell-stack (see the ESI†). The significant increase in the CH4 product can be accounted by the longer reaction path that the CO2 molecules go through before exiting the cell and the higher heat energy they would naturally experience in the cell-stack, both of which can help the hydrogenation of CO2 to CH4.

(b and c) The performance of the cell stack. (d) The concentration of CH4 produced by the cell-stack at different temperatures. (e) The concentration of CH4 produced by the cell stack discharging at different currents at 170 °C. 
Notably also, the amount of CH4 is higher when the current is higher, demonstrating again that CH4 is an exclusive product of CO2 reduction in the cell (Fig. 4e). The gas chromatogram obtained with a FID detector of the products produced by the cell discharging at different temperatures or currents is shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†). The rate of production of CH4 in the cell, which is calculated as described in the ESI,† is found to be 75.29 μmol gcat−1 h−1 when RuO2/CNTs are used as the CO2RR catalyst and Pt/C is used as the anode catalyst in it, with a flow rate of 80 mL min−1 and at a discharge current of 148 mA. This value is much higher than some notable, previously reported values for photocatalytic CO2RR cells involving G0-TiO2 (10.1 μmol gcat−1 h−1),37 Pt-TiO2-0.2HF (4 μmol gcat−1 h−1),38 Pd7Cu1 (20 μmol gcat−1 h−1),12 and PtRu/TiO2 (38.7 μmol gcat−1 h−1)39 catalysts.
All this means even better cell performances (cell voltage and power) and higher yields of CH4 can still be achieved if more than three cells are connected in series in the cell-stack. This is, once again, because the CO2 molecules will have even longer flow pathways and greater chances to undergo reduction. Such a device can help the transformation of CO2 (the greenhouse gas) into CH4 (a synthetic fuel) at high rates under the assistance of only (waste) heat energy.
Nyquist plots of the cell stack working at different temperatures can be found in Fig. S12a.† The value of the bulk resistance of the cell stack is higher than that of a single cell at the same working temperature. The value also becomes lower at higher working temperatures, which is in the same trend as that of a single cell.
The stability test of the cell is carried out and the result is shown in Fig. S12b.† The result demonstrates that the cell stack is quite stable during operation for 320 min at a discharging current of 96 mA and 170 °C, which supports the potential of the CO2/H2 fuel cell for practical application in the future.
Conclusions
In summary, a CO2/H2 fuel cell structure that can convert CO2 into CH4 while producing electrical energy has been demonstrated for the first time. The cell can produce CH4 at a rate of 75.29 μmol gcat−1 h−1 at 170 °C, which can be derived from waste heat. By stacking more cells in series, CH4 with even much higher yield along with high electrical energy output (voltage) can be realized. In addition, although the cell consumes H2, the electricity generated by this new cell can be used to produce that H2 needed with water electrolysis; therefore, theoretically, the cell consumes only waste heat to operate. DFT calculations were applied to determine the possible reaction pathways leading to CO2 reduction within the cell. The reported approach can serve as a viable route to transform CO2 into hydrocarbons while producing electricity at the expense of only (waste) heat. In the future, more work focusing on the cell stack assembly as well as the synthesis of sustainable and efficient catalysts to increase the reduction efficiency of CO2 and the power output of the cell will be explored to realize the practical application of this novel fuel cell.
Experimental
Synthesis of catalysts
To synthesize RuO2/CNTs, first, CNTs (1 g) were treated with HNO3 at 110 °C for 4 h in a 500 mL round bottom flask under continuous stirring. The CNTs were then separated with filtration, washed with water and dried at 60 °C overnight. The resulting HNO3-treated CNTs (200 mg) were dispersed in 300 mL solution of distilled water and ethanol (with a ratio of 1:1 (vol:vol)) under ultrasonication for 30 min. Then, RuCl3·nH2O (196 mg) was added, and the mixture was sonicated for another 30 min. This was followed by magnetic stirring of the mixture for 1 h at room temperature. Then, 0.5 M NaHCO3 aqueous solution was slowly added at a rate of 15 mL h−1 until the pH of the mixture reached 9.00. After continuously stirring the mixture for 6 h, the precipitate was separated by filtration and then washed with deionized water several times. The material was dried at 80 °C for 12 h. It was then heated under N2 gas flow (flowing at a rate of 100 sccm) at 350 °C in a tube furnace for 6 h, after raising the temperature of the furnace from room temperature to 350 °C at a heating rate of 3 °C min−1. Finally, a black powder product, RuO2/CNTs, was obtained.
To prepare Ru/CNTs, the HNO3-treated CNTs (0.5 g) obtained above were dispersed in 10 mL distilled water in a flask under ultrasonication for 1 h. Then, RuCl3·nH2O (0.2 mol) was added into the dispersion, and the mixture was further sonicated for another 1 h and stirred with a magnetic stirrer for 2 h. The flask containing the mixture was kept open at 70 °C in an oil bath overnight to let the solvent evaporate completely. The dried material was treated in a tube furnace at 400 °C for 4 h, after raising the temperature of the furnace from room temperature to 400 °C at a heating rate of 3 °C min−1, under a flow of H2:N2 (20% H2 and 80% N2, flowing at a rate of 100 sccm). This finally led to the desired product, Ru/CNTs.
Characterization of catalysts
X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments were conducted using a PANalytical X'Pert PRO diffractometer operating with 40 kV, 40 mA and Cu Kα as a radiation source. The diffraction patterns were obtained in a 2θ range of 10° to 90°. Field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) images were acquired using a JSM-6700F instrument (JEOL, Japan), and the images were used to analyze the structures and morphologies of the materials. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) images were obtained with a JEM-2100 instrument (JEOL, Japan), and the images were used to characterize and identify the microstructures of the samples. Elemental mapping images were obtained with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) on a HR-TEM instrument to determine the compositions of the samples. The materials were also analyzed with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using an ESCALAB Xi+ instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) operating with Al Kα as an X-ray source. All binding energies were calibrated using a C 1s peak (284.6 eV).
Preparation of electrodes
Both the cathode and anode used in the cell consisted of a current collector (a carbon paper) and an active layer. To make the active layer on the cathode, 75 wt% catalyst (RuO2/CNTs or Ru/CNTs) and 25 wt% polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) solution (taken from a commercially available 30 wt% PTFE) were mechanically mixed together with ethanol under ultrasonic dispersion for 1 h to inundate the powders. The resulting slurry was then pasted onto the carbon paper and dried at 60 °C for 4 h in an oven. The loading of the catalyst was 3 mg cm−2.
The active layer on the anode was composed of 50 wt% Pt/C (40% Pt) and 50 wt% Nafion solution (5%). After adding ethanol, the mixture was uniformly dispersed by ultrasonication for 1 h and then drop-casted onto a carbon paper. Finally, the paste was dried at 60 °C for 4 h in an oven. The loading of the catalyst on the anode was 2 mg cm−2.
A polybenzimidazole (PBI) membrane that was pre-soaked in phosphoric acid solution (85 wt%) for two days at room temperature was employed as a proton-exchange membrane.
The cathode, the phosphoric acid-treated PBI membrane, and the anode were then pressed together under a pressure of 1.5 MPa and kept at 130 °C for 4 min to obtain a membrane electrode assembly (MEA). It is worth noting that the cathode and the anode should face the PBI membrane.
Tests of the performances of the cell and cell-stack
A battery-testing system (Neware Technology Limited Company, Shenzhen, China) was employed to evaluate the discharge performance of the MEA. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra were measured on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660C, CH Instruments). A flowmeter (Qixing Huachuang Flowmeter Limited Company, Beijing, China) was used to adjust and monitor the gas flow rate in the cell. The amounts of CH4 and H2 evolved from the cell were determined using a gas chromatography (GC) instrument (Techcomp, GC 7980) using Ar as a carrier gas. The presence and amount of CH4 were analyzed by using a flame ionization detector (FID) (plot U with diameter: 0.53 mm and length: 30 m and whose column temperature was increased from 50 °C to 120 °C and then kept at 120 °C). To determine the concentration of CH4, 1 mL of gas from the outlet of the cathode was injected into the GC via an airtight injection needle (SGE, Australia) into the GC. The presence and amount of H2 were determined using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) via an automated sample loop (1 mL), which is used to inject the gas sample. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS, 7890A) (Agilent) was further used to analyze CH4.
