    , Accepted 31st October 2012First published on 9th November 2012AbstractA very high open-circuit voltage (Voc) has recently been achieved in dye-sensitised solar cells (DSSCs) using cobalt complex redox couple electrolytes because of the high positive redox potential of the electrolyte. However, the obtained Voc is lower than the expected value owing to fast back electron transfer reactions from the TiO2 surface to the redox species. Recombination may be retarded by introduction of steric barrier groups into the dye structure to block the approach of the cobalt complex towards the TiO2 surface. Herein, carbazole dyes with various structural features in each dye component, i.e., number of n-hexylthiophene units in the linker, bulky appendage in the donor group, and alkyl chain length in the thiophene linker moiety, were studied in order to retard the fast back electron transfer reactions. There was a positive relationship between Voc and the number of n-hexylthiophene units, bulkiness of the appendage group in the donor segment, and shorter alkyl chains in the thiophene linker moiety. The increased Voc was attributed to the retardation of charge recombination, demonstrating that longer and larger molecules exert better blocking function.
Introduction
Dye-sensitised solar cells (DSSCs) generally employ Ru complex dyes and the iodide/tri-iodide (I−/I3−) redox system to achieve high energy conversion efficiency.1–3 To facilitate large-scale application of DSSCs, reducing the materials cost, increasing the power conversion efficiency, and extending the stability of the cell are issues that must be addressed.4 Tireless efforts have been expended in the development of alternatives to the Ru complex dyes to offset increasing Ru costs due to its scarcity.4–12 In this regard, organic dyes are attractive alternatives to Ru complexes, but the issues of increasing the molar absorption coefficient, expanding the absorption range, and reducing the cost of these dyes must still be addressed. A power conversion efficiency higher than 9% has already been achieved for solar cells that employ organic dyes.9 Electrolytes are also a significant part of the DSSCs. A cell employing the I−/I3− redox system in conjunction with a Ru complex dye (N3 dye) loses 0.7 V in the regeneration of the dye, i.e., the difference between the I−/I3− redox potential (0.42 V vs. NHE) and the HOMO potential of the N3 dye (1.1 V vs. NHE). The two-electron reaction of the I−/I3− redox system appears to account for the large voltage loss.13–17 The visible light absorption of the tri-iodide in the electrolyte also undesirably decreases the light absorption of the dyes. Consequently, alternative redox couples have been desired.18,19
The initial application of cobalt bipyridyl complex redox couples to DSSCs was carried out in conjunction with Ru complex dyes. The efficiency of the resulting DSSCs was much lower than that of the cell employing the conventional I−/I3− redox couple.20–22 Recently, however, a power conversion efficiency of over 12% was achieved by employing bulky organic and Zn centred porphyrin dyes23 owing to the high open circuit voltage (Voc) of the cells.
The attractive feature of a cobalt complex is the adjustable redox potential that can be tuned using the ligand structure. This makes it possible to achieve a higher redox potential than that of the iodide system.21,22 Moreover, the energy loss due to dye regeneration may be decreased in the cobalt system, thereby increasing the open circuit voltages. Furthermore, the visible light absorption of the cobalt complex is less than that of tri-iodide, which may offer the benefit of increased photocurrent. On the other hand, most cobalt complexes are limited in terms of the fast charge recombination between the injected electrons and the cobalt complexes.24–26 For this reason, cobalt redox couples perform well only with dyes capable of blocking the approach of the redox species towards the surface of the TiO2 electrode.27–30 However, the performance achieved with the dyes is still not satisfactory, given that the electron lifetime of the cells employing the organic dyes and the cobalt tris-bipyridyl complex electrolyte is still shorter than that of the Ru dye and iodide system. The charge recombination may be effectively reduced by increasing the molecular size of the dye as well as the cobalt complex.28 However, cobalt complex redox couples are generally limited by high diffusion resistance in the pore of the TiO2 electrode, which decreases the fill factor and efficiency at high light intensity.27,30,31 Therefore, organic dyes with a stronger blocking effect in conjunction with a high extinction coefficient or TiO2 species with large pores are desired.
Herein, the possibility of retarding the recombination process and of adding a further blocking function was evaluated on the basis of the design and modification of the dye structure. The dyad and triad of the cobalt tris-bipyridylhexafluorophosphate complex (Co-bpy PF6) were used as the cobalt redox couples as well as modified dyes based on the MK-2 dye, which has a D–π–A structure (i.e., carbazole as a donor group, n-hexylthiophene as a linker group, and cyanoacrylate as an anchoring group). The dyes examined in this study are shown in Fig. 1. The effects of molecular size were investigated by comparing MK-2, MK-1, and MK-75 as the dye, each of which has a different number of n-hexylthiophene units in the linker group. The effect of the steric barrier in the donor segment was evaluated by comparing MK-14, MK-20, and MK-1. Furthermore, the effect of the alkyl chain length in the π spacer of the alkyl oligothiophene was investigated using MK-14 and MK-33. The performance of these dyes, having different structures, was evaluated on the basis of the I–V characteristics and the lifetime of the injected electrons in the DSSCs.

Experimental procedure
F-doped SnO2 coated glass (FTO-glass), used as a transparent conductive glass for the photoelectrodes and counter electrodes, was purchased from Asahi Glass Co., Ltd. (Asahi-U, ≤12 Ohm per square). TiO2 paste (DSL18NRT) consisting of 20 nm nanocrystalline particles was purchased from Dyesol Inc. The organic dye consisting of a 0.3 mM solution in toluene was used for dye adsorption. The electrolyte comprised a mixture of 0.22 M cobalt(II)bipyridyl PF6, 0.02 M cobalt(III)bipyridyl PF6, 0.1 M LiClO4, and 0.2 M 4-tertbutylpyridine (Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC) in acetonitrile (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd). Cobalt bipyridyl(II)/(III) PF6 was synthesised by the methods reported in an earlier study.27
MK dyes were synthesised using methods listed in the literature.8,11 The synthesis of an oligothiophene linker was performed by repeating the Suzuki coupling reaction with the corresponding n-hexylthiophene or n-propylthiophene boronic acid ester and bromination with N-bromosuccinimide. These dyes were obtained using the Vilsmeier reaction and Knoevenagel condensation with cyanoacetic acid. The detailed procedures for the syntheses of the new dyes, MK-20, MK-33, and MK-34, are described in the ESI.† MK-20, a 3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-substituted carbazole dye, was prepared from 9-ethyl-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-9H-carbazole. The synthesis of the donor portion, 9-ethyl-3-(4-n-hexyloxyphenyl)-9H-carbazole, of MK-33 and MK-34 has been previously reported.12 The molecular structures of the compounds were fully confirmed using 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy.
The TiO2 mesoporous layers were prepared on FTO-glass substrates by the doctor blading method, i.e., the TiO2 paste was coated onto the substrate and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. The thickness of the transparent TiO2 layer was 4 μm. The FTO-glass was immersed in 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min prior to coating with TiO2 paste. The sintered TiO2 layer was shaped to the dimensions of 4 mm × 4 mm by scraping. Immediately after reheating the TiO2 layers at 450 °C for 30 min, the layers were immersed in the dye solution for 18 h at room temperature to facilitate dye adsorption. The counter electrodes were prepared by drilling two holes into the FTO-glass substrates for electrolyte injection followed by sputtering platinum, used as a catalyst, onto the substrate. The photoelectrode and counter electrode were sandwiched by the insertion of a 30 μm thick layer of thermo-bonding polymer (Surlyn®, DuPont™), and these electrodes were heated for sealing. After sealing, the electrolyte was injected between the two electrodes by means of the hole in the counter electrode; the hole was then sealed with Surlyn and a glass slide.
The high-performance cell was fabricated by employing a TiO2 mesoporous layer composed of a 6.5 μm semitransparent layer having 37 nm particles (Solaronix D37) and a 4 μm light scattering layer of 400 nm particles (CCIC, Japan). The TiO2 layer was annealed at 500 °C for 1 h. The resulting TiO2 electrode was immersed in 160 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 60 °C for 30 min after sintering. The methods used for dye sensitization, cell assembly, and electrolyte injection were the same as outlined above.
The photocurrent–voltage (I–V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 SourceMeter® in combination with a solar simulator (YSS-100A, Yamashita Denso Co.) with AM 1.5 G filters. The light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 was calibrated with a silicon photodiode. The active cell area was fixed at 0.090 cm2, corresponding to the aperture area, by using a photo mask on top of the cells. The electron lifetimes and densities at open circuit were measured by using the stepped light-induced photocurrent and voltage transients (SLIM-PCV)32,33 and the charge extraction method,33,34 respectively.
Results and discussion
Effect of the π-spacer length
To examine the effect of the spacer length, we compared the dyes MK-75, MK-1, and MK-2 having two, three, and four n-hexylthiophene units, respectively. Fig. 2 displays the I–V curves of the cells with these dyes under one-sun conditions and in the dark. The Voc value increased with the increasing number of the n-hexylthiophene units in the dyes, and the dye with quarter-hexylthiophene units, MK-2, exhibited a Voc that was ca. 70 mV higher than that of the bi-hexylthiophene-unit dye, MK-75 (Table 1).

The Voc values ranked according to the electron density in the TiO2 and the conduction band edge potential. Thus, both high electron injection and low charge recombination rates can increase the Voc value. Fig. 2 shows that Jsc increases with the number of n-hexylthiophene units in the dyes owing to broadening of the absorption band. Therefore, the higher Voc obtained with MK-2 is partially attributable to the higher electron injection. Considering the dark current, the onset voltage increased in the order MK-75 < MK-1 < MK-2. The onset voltage depends on the TiO2 conduction band edge potential and the charge recombination rate. If the conduction band edge potentials are the same with these dyes, the difference in the dark currents suggests that a longer spacer resulted in a longer electron lifetime in the cells. Note that for the case of the iodine redox system, a longer π spacer may result in a faster recombination rate,35 which we have attributed to the increased dispersion force between the dye and I3− molecules. In fact, the Voc of the cells utilising the iodide electrolyte decreased in the longer π spacer dye, MK-2, when compared to MK-75 (Table 1). In the case of the cobalt redox couples, the I–V curves in Fig. 2 suggest that the blocking effect induced by the increased length of the dye molecules negates (i.e., dominates) the effect of dispersion force.
Effect of additional units attached to the donor segment
To further evaluate the blocking effect, the effect of attaching an additional nonconjugated unit to the carbazole moiety was investigated. Fig. 3 shows the I–V curve of the cell employing the MK-20 dye, which has a methyl-O-phenyl group at the 3-carbon position. A higher Voc was observed for the cell containing the MK-20 dye than that observed for the cell with MK-1, and the difference between the Voc of these cells was 27 mV. The I–V curve acquired in the dark indicates that recombination was also suppressed by MK-20 in comparison with MK-1. A further increase in the Voc was obtained by employing MK-14, which possesses a hexyl-O-phenyl group instead of the methyl-O-phenyl group. The difference in the Voc of the DSSCs constructed with MK-14 and with MK-1 was 54 mV (Table 1). The dark current of the MK-14 cell was also suppressed relative to that of the MK-20 cell, consistent with the retardation of the charge recombination due to the larger molecular size of the dye.
 Fig. 3  
I–V curves of cells with the carbazole dyes having different appendage groups in donor and linker segments. The upper and lower I–V curves were measured under one-sun illumination and dark conditions, respectively. 
Effect of the alkyl chain length attached to thiophene
The aforementioned carbazole dyes possess n-hexyl groups in the oligothiophene linker units, and these chains function to fill the exposed TiO2 surface of the electrode, thereby blocking the approach of the acceptor species. In the case of the iodine redox system, the propyl side chain was sufficient to retard the recombination.36 Thus, we compared the effect of the n-hexyl group and the n-propyl group in the oligothiophene unit on the cell performance. The cell containing MK-33, having n-propylthiophene, exhibited a higher Voc and a slightly larger Jsc than the cell with MK-14, having the n-hexylthiophene appendage. The absorptivity of MK-33, 1.42 × 10−4 ± 0.02 × 10−4 mol cm−3, was approximately 17% higher than that of MK-14, 1.22 × 10−4 ± 0.09 × 10−4 mol cm−3. The method for measuring the absorptivity of the dye on the TiO2 substrate is described in the ESI.† Employing n-propylthiophene reduces the required area for dye adsorption on TiO2. The high coverage of MK-33 on the TiO2 substrate plausibly enhances the blocking effect, thereby increasing the Voc. Fig. 4 shows the absorption spectra of MK-14 and MK-33 on a 2 μm thick TiO2 layer and the IPCE spectra of the cells sensitised with MK-14 and MK-33. The absorbance in the 350 nm to 480 nm region for MK-33 on the TiO2 layer is larger than that for MK-14, and the cells constructed with MK-33 had a slightly higher IPCE than those utilising MK-14. Here, the blueshift of the absorption band of MK-33 on the TiO2 substrate may be due to H-aggregation, but this needs to be substantiated.11,37

Electron lifetime in the DSSCs
In order to elucidate the origin of the increased Voc, the electron lifetime of the cells with MK-1, MK-20, MK-14, MK-33, and MK-34 was measured. Fig. 5 shows the electron lifetime and open circuit voltage as a function of the electron density of the cells. MK-20 and MK-14 exhibited a longer electron lifetime than MK-1 and the lifetime was increased with the alkyl chain length in the donor moiety. Among the dyes containing the terthiophene linker, the dye with n-propyl groups in the oligothiophene linker, MK-33, showed the longest electron lifetime, which was approximately ten times longer than that of MK-1. This result reflects the efficiency of the blocking effect of MK-33 in comparison with MK-1, attributed to the bulky additional group in the donor and better dye coverage of the TiO2 layer with the former. MK-34 with a quarter-n-propylthiophene linker exhibited a lifetime comparable to that of MK-33. The Vocvs. n plot was comparable for all dyes, indicating that the conduction band edge potentials of the cells containing the various carbazole dyes were the same. Thus, the increase in the Voc in response to the different appendage groups in the dyes was solely due to the increased lifetime.
 Fig. 5  Electron lifetime (a) and Voc (b) as a function of electron density for the DSSCs with various carbazole dyes and with cobalt electrolyte and iodide electrolyte. 
Comparison of the iodine redox system with the cobalt redox couple shows that the Voc of the respective DSSCs at a matched electron density was 140 mV higher for the cobalt system than that for the iodine redox system. Therefore, if the DSSCs constructed with the cobalt complexes have the same electron lifetime as the DSSCs containing the iodine redox system, 140 mV higher Voc is expected for the former. However, the electron lifetimes of both the MK-1 and MK-33 cells with the cobalt electrolyte were shorter than that of MK-1 and MK-33 cells with the iodine redox electrolyte. Therefore, further modification of MK-33 is desired.
In the case of the MK-1 and MK-33 dyes coupled with the iodine redox system, a longer electron lifetime was obtained with MK-1. This may be due to the unbalanced length of the alkyl chains of MK-33; i.e., because the hexyl-O-phenyl group was not attached along the axis of the thiophene linker, the resulting angle may cause an increase in the distance between the dyes when they are adsorbed in a face-to-face orientation, whereas the propyl side chain may not provide enough coverage of the space between the dyes. For the iodine redox couple, a large space between the dyes may be deleterious.
Optimization of the TiO2 electrode
To study the effect of the dye structure, a relatively thin TiO2 electrode was utilised in order to minimise undesired electrolyte diffusion. In order to harvest more light, a thicker transparent electrode and an additional scattering layer are required. However, simply increasing the thickness of the electrode would increase the diffusion resistance, thereby decreasing the fill factor. This diffusion limitation also results in a lowered concentration of reduced redox species near the dye cation with consequently deleterious recombination between the injected electrons and the dye cation. In order to augment the performance of the DSSCs utilising the MK dyes, larger TiO2 particles were used in the preparation of the TiO2 electrodes to facilitate a larger pore size in the electrode. Fig. 6 shows the I–V curves of the DSSCs prepared with the large particle TiO2 semitransparent layer and a scattering layer. In the thin electrode study, the performance of the cell employing MK-33 was comparable to the performance achieved with MK-2. Thus, to obtain high efficiency, we employed MK-34, which has the same structure as MK-33 but has one more thiophene unit in the linker. The dye sensitization of these cells was carried out using toluene–acetonitrile–tert-butyl alcohol (1:1:1 volume ratio) mixed solvent and toluene. Higher Voc and efficiency were achieved with MK-34 than with MK-2 (Table 2). Given that the use of pure toluene resulted in too much dye adsorption, thereby decreasing the fill factor, a mixed solvent was used to obtain moderate dye adsorption to provide a balance between the fill factor and Jsc. However, the amount of dye adsorbed from the mixed solvent was not sufficient to obtain a high Jsc. For MK-34, we reverted to the toluene solution and fabricated several cells using the same dye solution. After fabricating several cells from this solution of MK-34, an efficiency of 7.9% was achieved. It is assumed that this increase in efficiency after the fabrication of several cells was due to the decrease in the dye concentration in the toluene solution, thereby furnishing the optimal concentration of the dye on the TiO2 substrate. Additional cells were also fabricated using other TiO2 particles and with MK-34 and cobalt complex redox couples; the effect of solvent and the concentration of dye in the dye solution varied depending on the pore size distribution of the TiO2. Thus, for practical applications, the dyes must be further modified to prevent the requirement for such precise preparation conditions to obtain the best performance of solar cells.

Conclusions
The relationship between the performance of DSSCs utilizing the cobalt redox system and the carbazole dye structure was evaluated by varying the bulkiness of the donor group and linker group. The Voc increased drastically with increasing bulkiness of the donor group. The optimal length of the alkyl side chains of the dye must be tuned depending on the size and direction of additional units attached to the donor segment so that the side chains can fill the spaces between aligned dye molecules. The increase in the Voc achieved with MK-33 was attributed solely to the increased electron lifetime, given that MK-33 having a hexyl-O-phenyl group in the donor portion and an n-propyl group in the linker region exhibited a longer electron lifetime than MK-1 having an ethyl group in the donor portion and an n-hexyl group in the linker region. The highest efficiency of 7.9% was achieved with MK-34, which is structurally similar to MK-33 but has four thiophene units instead of three. Though better performance was achieved using these larger molecular size dyes, their use was limited by the requirement for highly precise control of the dye adsorption conditions.
