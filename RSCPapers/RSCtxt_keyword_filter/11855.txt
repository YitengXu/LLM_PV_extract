    , Accepted 20th November 2015First published on 20th November 2015AbstractA solution-processed organometallic halide perovskite-based bulk heterojunction (BHJ) memory device with a configuration of indium-doped tin oxide (ITO)/CH3NH3PbI3:PVK/Al has been successfully fabricated. Under a threshold voltage of −1.57 V, this device shows a nonvolatile write-once read-many-times (WORM) memory effect, with a maximum ON/OFF current ratio exceeding 103. In contrast, the ITO/CH3NH3PbI3/Al device showed only conductor characteristics, while the PVK-based device exhibited insulator behavior. Upon being subjected to voltages, an interesting filamentary nature of the CH3NH3PbI3:PVK film was also observed in situ at the microscopic nanometer level using a conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) technique with a device configuration of Si/Pt/CH3NH3PbI3:PVK/Pt. The mechanism associated with the memory effect is discussed. The electric-field-induced intermolecular charge transfer effect between CH3NH3PbI3 and PVK, and the possible conformational ordering of the PVK side-chains/backbone under an applied bias voltage, may cause the electrical conductivity switching and WORM effect in the reported BHJ device.
Since the first application of an organometallic halide perovskite1,2 (CH3NH3PbI3) in dye-sensitized solar cells in 2009,3 this material and its derivatives (e.g. (C4H9NH3)2 (CH3NH3)x−1SnxI3x+1, CH3NH3PbBrxCl3−x, CH3NH3PbBrxI3−x, CH3NH3MX3 (M = Pb, Sn; X = Cl, Br, I), CH3NH3PbClxI3−x and CH3NH3SnBrxI3−x) have attracted growing attention4–7 worldwide in the fields of organic photovoltaics, photodetectors, photocatalysts, transistors, and light-emitting diodes due to their high linear absorption coefficient (1.5 × 104 cm−1 at 550 nm),8 tunable bandgap (1.17–2.3 eV),6,9,10 long exciton diffusion length (100–1000 nm),11,12 high electron mobility (e.g. 66 cm2 V−1 s−1 for CH3NH3PbI3 and 2320 cm2 V−1 s−1 for CH3NH3SnI3),13 high crystallinity and solution processability. A significant certified power conversion efficiency of 20.1% has been reported so far.14 Our current interest in perovskites mainly involves their potential applications in memory devices. Some inorganic perovskites with the chemical formula ABX3, in which the size of cation A is larger than that of cation B, and X is an anion that binds to both the cations, have been used in the fabrication of resistive random access memory devices.15,16 However, these high-temperature-processed materials with rigid structures are more breakable during device fabrication and performance measurements.17 Very recently, Yoo et al. reported the bistable resistive switching effect of a sandwich-type Au/CH3NH3PbClxI3−x/FTO (flourine-doped tin oxide) device, with a very small ON/OFF current ratio of ∼5 and a small turn-on voltage of less than 1 V.18 Although too small ON/OFF ratios will greatly restrict the practical applications of the corresponding digital devices, this is still the first example of hybrid perovskite-based memory devices.
The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) concept has been widely used for mainstream polymer solar cells, in which an interpenetrated charge channel connecting the two electrodes was formed by blending the polymer as an electron donor with an electron acceptor material.19,20 The driving force for the charge transport was ascribed either to the concentration-gradient-induced diffusion or the electric-field-induced drift of charge carriers.21 In this contribution, using CH3NH3PbI3:poly(N-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) for the blend active layers, a solution-processed halide perovskite-based BHJ memory device was fabricated for the first time (Fig. 1a). Under a threshold voltage of −1.57 V, this device exhibited a nonvolatile WORM memory effect, with a maximum ON/OFF current ratio exceeding 103. The relatively high ON/OFF current ratio can promise a low misreading rate through the precise control of the ON and OFF states, making the device work more highly efficiently. In contrast, the ITO/CH3NH3PbI3/Al device showed only conductor characteristics, while the ITO/PVK/Al device exhibited insulator behavior under the same experimental conditions. WORM memory, which can be turned ON (high conductivity state) only once and cannot be switched OFF (low conductivity state) even if a reverse bias is applied, is usually used in conventional programmable read-only memory devices and also for DVD-R and CD-R media.

PVK (Mw ∼ 90000) was purchased from Aldrich Co. The perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 was prepared as described by Im et al.8 From Fig. 1b, it can be clearly seen that the diameter of the CH3NH3PbI3 crystals was between 2 and 18 nm. Its average diameter was about 7.94 nm. Thermogravimetric analysis of CH3NH3PbI3 (Fig. 1c) indicated two weight-loss plateaus. At lower temperatures, almost no weight loss occurred. Its onset temperature for thermal bond cleavage was 334 °C, which is lower than that of PVK (480 °C). Atomic-force microscopy (AFM) of the blends showed a roughness of 13.2 nm (Fig. 1d): a smooth interface at both material/metal contacts can effectively enhance charge injection and transport in the corresponding device. In a typical fabrication procedure for a BHJ memory device, the CH3NH3PbI3:PVK (weight ratio: 1:1) active layer (∼200 nm) was spin coated on the pre-cleaned ITO substrate from a homogeneous γ-butyrolactone solution of these two components at a spinning speed of 400 rpm for 12 s and then 2000 rpm for 40 s. Afterwards, the device was thoroughly vacuum dried at 80 °C overnight. To complete fabrication of the device, Al top electrodes (200 nm thick) were thermally deposited on the surface of the active layer through a shadow mask at 10−7 Torr. All electrical measurements in this work were performed using a Keithley 4200 semiconductor parameter analyzer under ambient conditions without any protection. The sweeping step was 0.01 V. For comparison, ITO/CH3NH3PbI3/Al and ITO/PVK/Al devices were also fabricated under the same experimental conditions. An atomic force microscope (Dimension V, Veeco) equipped with a conducting cantilever coated with Pt was employed for the C-AFM measurements of the device.
As shown in Fig. 2a, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of PVK had a strong diffraction peak at 2θ = 7.67°, from which the nearest chain-to-chain distance was calculated to be 11.51 Å, and a broad, diffuse amorphous halo at 2θ = 20.64° (d = 4.30 Å). CH3NH3PbI3 has a typical tetragonal perovskite structure,22,23 whose characteristic diffraction peaks were found to be centered at 2θ = 14.1° (110), 20.0° (112), 23.6° (211), 24.5° (202), 28.4° (220), 32.0° (310) and 35.0° (312). The corresponding crystal faces are indicated in parentheses. As expected, the XRD pattern of CH3NH3PbI3/PVK blends was a simple superposition of the XRD patterns of these two components. No additional information is available. The UV/Vis absorption spectra of the thin-film samples were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer. As indicated in Fig. 2b, the absorption peaks of the PVK and CH3NH3PbI3 films were located at 304, 335 and 347 nm for the former and 402, 503, and 749 nm for the latter. After blending PVK with CH3NH3PbI3, a new peak at 422 nm was observed in the electronic absorption spectrum of the CH3NH3PbI3:PVK film when compared with PVK and CH3NH3PbI3.

Typical nonvolatile WORM memory behavior obtained from the current–voltage (I–V) profile of the Al/CH3NH3PbI3:PVK (200 nm)/ITO device in an ambient environment is shown in Fig. 3. Generally, a nonvolatile memory device will retain all stored data even if the power is switched off. Initially, as shown in Fig. 3a, the device was in the OFF state. The current increased slowly along with an increase in the voltage when a negative voltage was applied. In this state, the current was rather low. When the threshold voltage of −1.57 V was reached, the current increased suddenly from 10−6 to 10−3 A. This suggested that the device transited from the OFF state to the ON state. Generally, this procedure served as the writing process. The ON state device retained its high conductivity state in the following forward- and reverse-biased sweeps with applied voltages of up to ±3 V, and also with the power off, suggesting nonvolatile WORM electronic memory characteristics. An ON/OFF current ratio of more than 103, which can guarantee a low misreading rate when the voltage is controlled precisely, was achieved in this BHJ device. Fig. 3b shows no significant degradation in either the ON state or the OFF state during the entire measuring process, suggesting good device stability. As shown in Fig. 3c, both the ON and OFF states were insensitive to read cycles, even when more than 106 read cycles (pulse width = 10 μs, pulse period = 20 μs) were applied to the device. In contrast to the BHJ device, the ITO/CH3NH3PbI3/Al device did not exhibit any memory effect (Fig. 3d). More precisely, this device showed only conductor characteristics under the same measurement conditions. The current–voltage characteristics of the ITO/PVK/Al device are shown in Fig. 3e. During the forward and reverse biased sweeps with an applied voltage of up to ±3 V, the device remains in the single low-conductivity state.

The switching mechanism for the bistable electrical behavior in nanoparticles/electroactive polymer-based devices has been well-explored.24–26 In our device, the bistable behavior can be attributed to an electric field-induced electron transfer from PVK to CH3NH3PbI3. The electric field across the active layer will increase with the applied voltage. At the switching threshold voltage, the external electric field is high enough for the electron transfer between the PVK donor and the perovskite acceptor in the active layer, creating a conductive film. The device is thus switched from the OFF state to the ON state. The negative charges on the perovskite are stable and prevented from moving back even when the applied voltage is removed, resulting in the nonvolatile nature of the device. When a reverse (positive) bias is applied to the device, the applied electric field is opposed by the built-in electric field associated with the thin film. The built-in electric field will prevent the trapped electrons from being extracted, and the device remains in the high conductivity state, characteristic of the behavior of a WORM memory.
To gain insights into the switching mechanism of this BHJ memory device mentioned above, in situ C-AFM measurements were carried out to reveal the interesting filamentary nature of the CH3NH3PbI3:PVK film upon being subjected to voltages. As a variation of AFM and scanning tunneling microscopy, C-AFM, which uses electrical current to construct the surface profile of the studied sample, can be used to reveal electric field-induced surface morphological changes in situ. In our study, a Pt-coated conductive AFM tip was used as a movable electrode that could be positioned with nanometer-scale precision and a controlled nanonewton-range force.27 From Fig. 4a, one can see that in the high resistance state (i.e., OFF state) only a very low current (<1 nA) is observed at −0.5 V. When the applied voltage was changed from −0.5 V to −2 V, the device transited from the OFF state to the ON state. In this stage the highly conductive regions (about 5 nA) appear in the C-AFM current map (Fig. 4b) due to the electric-field-induced intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect between PVK and CH3NH3PbI3, and the possible conformational ordering of the PVK side-chains/backbone28,29 under an applied bias voltage. The diameters of the conductive areas vary from about 10 nm to 25 nm. Electrical current would flow through them preferentially once these highly conductive regions form. The other regions of the film were, however, no longer subjected to the applied field, and would not undergo any changes in physicochemical properties.
 Fig. 4  (a and b) C-AFM current maps of the CH3NH3PbI3:PVK thin film with a scanning size of 0.35 × 0.35 mm2 upon being subjected to voltage. A device with a configuration of Si/Pt/CH3NH3PbI3:PVK/Pt was used for C-AFM measurements; (c) UV/Vis absorption spectra of the CH3NH3PbI3:PVK thin film; and (d) fluorescence spectra of the CH3NH3PbI3:PVK thin film. λex = 365 nm. 
Interestingly, after a voltage of 2 V was applied to the CH3NH3PbI3:PVK film on the ITO substrate, its absorption spectrum (Fig. 4c) was found to shift to the red by Δλ = 4 nm, followed by considerable broadening of the absorption spectrum owing to the electric-field-induced ICT30 interaction between the PVK donor31 and the perovskite acceptor.32,33 The difference in the LUMO levels between PVK (LUMO: −2.2 eV) and CH3NH3PbI3 (LUMO: −3.9 eV) is much greater than 0.3 eV, implying that almost 100% charge transfer from PVK to CH3NH3PbI3 can easily occur in such a system. After the power had been switched off for several minutes, the observed absorption spectrum was the same as that obtained at 2 V. This result suggests that electric-field-induced electronic structural changes remain even when the power is off, which will favor retention of the separated/trapped charge carriers in the BHJ memory device. And more, by using 365 nm excitation light (which selectively excited the PVK entity), we recorded the steady-state fluorescence spectra of the CH3NH3PbI3:PVK film before and after applying the voltage (Fig. 4d). In the high resistance state (at 0 V), the film exhibited a strong emission peak at 413 nm. After the voltage of 2 V was applied to the film, a significant fluorescence quenching was observed. This quenching process is likely due to the electron transfer process from PVK to . In addition, it was also found that the energy bandgap of CH3NH3PbI3 as an electron acceptor (1.5 eV) is smaller than that of PVK as an electron donor (3.5 eV), implying that the energy transfer between PVK and CH3NH3PbI3 can also simultaneously occur in the low resistance state (i.e., ON state).
Conclusions
It has been demonstrated that the as-fabricated ITO/CH3NH3PbI3:PVK/Al BHJ device shows a promising nonvolatile WORM memory effect with a turn-on voltage of about −1.57 V and an ON/OFF current ratio in an excess of 103. The ON state can withstand a constant voltage stress of −1 V for 104 s and 106 read cycles at −1 V under ambient conditions. In contrast, both the ITO/CH3NH3PbI3/Al and ITO/PVK/Al devices did not exhibit any memory behavior. The electric-field-induced ICT effect between CH3NH3PbI3 and PVK, and the possible conformational ordering of the PVK side-chains/backbone under an applied bias voltage, may cause the electrical conductivity switching and WORM effect in the reported BHJ device. With the advantages conferred by the bulk heterojunctions,20 organometallic halide perovskite-based polymer BHJ devices hold great promise for the next generation of information storage applications.
