    , Accepted 12th June 2014First published on 13th June 2014AbstractDye illumination is a core factor in enhancing the electron density in the conduction band of TiO2 nanocrystallites and therefore also affects the power conversion efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). We investigated the use of anodes composed of TiO2/GeO2 nanocrystallites in DSSCs with the aim of increasing the power conversion efficiency. The interference effects from light reflected from the TiO2/GeO2 and GeO2/electrolyte interfaces significantly enhanced the intensity of the light used to illuminate the dye. We found an optimum power conversion efficiency of 7.91% (measured under standard AM 1.5 test conditions) in the DSSC using TiO2/0.5 wt% GeO2 nanocrystallites compared with 6.05% in a DSSC based on pure TiO2, an efficiency enhancement of 30.7%. This strategy provides a new opportunity for the fabrication of highly efficient DSSCs and the efficiency could be further improved using scalable techniques and components.
1. Introduction
The current increase in industrial development and improvements in living standards, combined with the need for a low-carbon economy, have created a demand for sources of renewable energy. Solar energy accounts for 99% of the total energy on the Earth. Therefore the direct conversion of solar energy into electricity with zero emissions of pollutants is a promising solution to our energy problems.1–3 As an energy alternative, perovskite-sensitized solar cells are emerging as potential generators of electricity. However, although the power conversion efficiency of these cells has already exceeded 15%, with the potential to increase further as techniques are optimized and new materials are developed,4 perovskite-sensitized solar cells still suffer from a lack of thermal stability and can also be affected by changes in humidity. More flexible designs and more environmentally friendly devices are required.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), electrochemical devices that convert solar energy directly into electricity by redox processes, are attracting much interest because of their advantages of producing clean, low-cost electricity with a relatively high power conversion efficiency and zero emissions.5–8 Compared with perovskite-sensitized solar cells, DSSC are relatively environmentally stable and can be used on flexible surfaces. A typical DSSC is composed of a dye-sensitized TiO2 anode, a redox electrolyte containing I−/I3− species, and a Pt counter electrode. The organic dye sensitizers absorb photons and jump from the ground electronic state to an excited state. As a result of the instability of the excited dye molecules, photogenerated electrons are released and transferred to the conduction band (CB) of the TiO2 nanocrystallites. The interconnected network of the TiO2 nanocrystallites provides channels for the transfer of electrons from the TiO2 to the conductive glass substrate. The oxidized dye molecules are recovered by the I− species, which are subsequently converted to I3− ions and diffuse to the interface with the counter electrode. The I3− ions are reduced to I− ions by the counter electrode as a result of an electrocatalytic effect. The electron density in the CB of the TiO2 nanocrystallites promotes the photocurrent density and therefore increases the power conversion efficiency of the DSSC.9 Many efforts have been made to increase the electron density of the CB in TiO2, such as placing a blocking layer and a reflecting layer behind the TiO2 film,10,11 or irradiating the device from the front and rear sides at the same time.12 We recently reported12 the design of a bifacial DSSC using a transparent polyaniline counter electrode. The incident light from the polyaniline electrode has a compensation effect on the light from the TiO2 anode, significantly enhancing the intensity of light available for dye illumination and therefore increasing the cumulative electron density in the CB of the TiO2 nanocrystallites.
We report here the design of TiO2/GeO2 nanocrystallite anodes, which we have developed in an attempt to increase the density of the photogenerated electrons in the CB of the TiO2 nanocrystallites. The interference light intensity is enhanced by light beams reflected at the TiO2/GeO2 and GeO2/air (electrolyte) interfaces, increasing the illumination of the dye and therefore the number of photogenerated electrons released from the excited dyes. This concept of increased light harvesting is of significance for other solar cells, such as perovskite-sensitized solar cells.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Unless stated otherwise, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.
2.2 Preparation of TiO2/GeO2 nanocrystallites
The TiO2/GeO2 nanocrystallites were prepared as follows. Under vigorous agitation at room temperature, 100 mL of deionized water was mixed with 10 mL of titanium tetrabutanolate. After 30 min the mixture was pump-filtrated to obtain dehydrated filter powders. Subsequently, 10 mL of acetic acid and 0.8 mL of nitric acid were added dropwise to these filter powders in a flask. After agitating for 15 min at 80 °C, the volume of the mixture was adjusted to 170 mL by adding deionized water. The reactant was further agitated at 80 °C for 15 min in a sealed atmosphere. GeO2 nanoparticles were then added into the reagent at stoichiometric ratios and the resulting colloid was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 200 °C for 12 h. A homogeneous mixture consisting of 65 mL of the white colloid and 0.4 g of commercial P25 was formed under ultrasonic irradiation for 30 min and then transferred to another Teflon-lined autoclave, which was subsequently heated at 200 °C for 12 h. After removing the supernatant liquid, the colloid was mixed with 0.8 g of poly(ethylene glycol) (Mw 20000) and 1 mL of OP emulsifier and then concentrated at 80 °C.
2.3 Fabrication of photo-anodes
FTO glass substrates (12 Ω square−1) with a size of 2 × 2 cm2 were thoroughly rinsed with deionized water and anhydrous ethanol and then dried by an N2 gas flow. The TiO2/GeO2 photo-anodes were fabricated by a doctor-blade method. The size of the resultant photo-anodes was controlled at 0.5 × 0.5 cm2 with an average thickness of 10 μm for the TiO2/GeO2 layer. The air-dried colloids were calcined in a muffle furnace at 450 °C for 30 min. The increase in temperature was controlled at a speed of 2 °C min−1 to 130 °C and then at 6 °C min−1 to 450 °C. The resultant TiO2/GeO2 films were immersed in a 0.50 mM N719 ethanol solution for 24 h to obtain the dye-sensitized TiO2/GeO2 photo-anodes.
2.4 Assembly of DSSCs
Each DSSC was assembled by sandwiching together a dye-sensitized TiO2/GeO2 photo-anode, a liquid electrolyte, and a Pt counter electrode (300–400 μm in thickness, purchased from Dalian HepatChroma SolarTech Co., Ltd). The redox electrolyte consisted of 100 mM tetraethylammonium iodide, 100 mM tetramethylammonium iodide, 100 mM tetrabutylammonium iodide, 100 mM NaI, 100 mM KI, 100 mM LiI, 50 mM I2, and 500 mM 4-tert-butyl pyridine in 50 mL of acetonitrile.
2.5 Photovoltaic tests
Photovoltaic tests were carried out on the DSSCs by measuring the characteristic photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, Shanghai Chenhua Device Company, China) under irradiation from a simulated solar light (a 100 W xenon arc lamp, XQ-500 W) in an ambient atmosphere. The incident light intensity was 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5). Each photovoltaic test was repeated at least five times and an average J–V curve was used.
2.6 Other characterizations
The morphologies of the resultant TiO2/0.5 wt% GeO2 and pure TiO2 anodes were observed with a scanning electron microscope (S-3500N, Hitachi, Japan). The optical absorption spectra were recorded on a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Agilent 8453) at room temperature. Fourier transform Raman spectroscopic measurements in UV light were made using a Renishaw inVia Reflex Raman spectrometer. High resolution gratings were used to give a spectral resolution of 2 cm−1. The spectra were recorded at room temperature from 3200 to 100 cm−1 using 16 scans with an exposure time of 1 s per scan. X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles of the resultant nanocrystallites were recorded on an X-ray powder diffractometer (X'pert MPD Pro, Philips, The Netherlands) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) in the 2θ range 20–70°, operating at a 40 kV accelerating voltage and a 40 mA current. For the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements, the DSSCs were scanned from 0.1 Hz to 2 MHz at an a.c. amplitude of 10 mV. XPS measurements were made on an RBD upgraded PHI-5000C ESCA system (Perkin-Elmer) with Mg Kα radiation (hν = 1253.6 eV).
3. Results and discussion
The morphology of the nanocrystallite anode is important in determining the photovoltaic performance of a DSSC.13 We describe here the top-view SEM morphologies of the resultant TiO2/0.5 wt% GeO2 nanocrystallite films prepared by our sol-hydrothermal method. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the anode surface using TiO2/0.5 wt% GeO2 is homogeneous and no aggregation is observed. Examination at higher resolution (Fig. 1(b)) indicates a mesoporous structure. However, it is difficult to distinguish the GeO2 nanoparticles from the TiO2 nanoparticles because of their similar size and shape (Fig. 1(c and d)). The task of the nanocrystallite anode is to take up organic dye molecules and to transfer electrons by forming interconnected channels using the TiO2 nanoparticles. The mesoporous TiO2/GeO2 films with connected pores favoring the mass transport of electrons are therefore useful for the fabrication of efficient DSSC devices.14

XRD is an efficient technique to use in identifying the crystal phase and size of the nanocrystallites of pure TiO2 and TiO2/GeO2. The diffraction peaks at 2θ = 25.2, 37.8, 48.1, 53.9, 55.2, 62.7, and 68.8 in the pattern for pure TiO2 are identified and attributed to the diffraction faces of the (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), (204), and (116) planes, respectively. These results show that the crystal phase of pure TiO2 is anatase (Fig. 2(a)).15 No diffraction peak corresponding to GeO2 is detected,16 indicating that the GeO2 species may have been completely covered by TiO2, or that the dosage of GeO2 is much lower. From the XPS spectrum of the TiO2/0.5 wt% GeO2 nanocrystallite (Fig. 2(b)), it is apparent that the Ge 3d5/2 photoelectron band is observed at 35.2 eV, indicating the successful combination of GeO2 into the TiO2. To reveal the effect of GeO2 on the crystalline structure of TiO2, the crystallite size was determined using the Scherrer equation and the structural parameters are summarized in Table 1:17 (1)where L is the crystallite size, λ is the wavelength of the X-ray radiation (Cu Kα = 0.15418 nm), K is usually taken as 0.89, and β is the line width at half-maximum height. In addition, the crystal lattice distortion (Δd/d) can be evaluated from the equation:18 (2)

The crystallite sizes of the TiO2/GeO2 nanocrystallites have decreased compared with that of pure TiO2, suggesting that GeO2 hinders the growth of crystallites due to the segregation of Ge4+ at the grain boundary.19 Moreover, in comparison with a Δd/d value of 0.003 in the pure TiO2 nanocrystallites, the values for crystal lattice distortion are all significantly increased. This indicates that many defects are produced in the TiO2/GeO2 nanocrystallites, providing many placeholders for dye adsorption.
UV-visible diffuse reflection spectra were recorded (Fig. 2(c)) to determine the photoabsorption behavior of the TiO2/GeO2 nanocrystallites. As a comparison, the UV-visible reflection spectrum of pure TiO2 was also determined under the same conditions. No obvious alteration in shape was observed after the integration of GeO2. A red shift was detected for TiO2/GeO2 compared with pure TiO2 because of the partial doping of Ge into the TiO2 crystal lattice.8,14 The band gap energy (Eg) can be calculated according to the equation:20 Eg = 1240/λ(3)where λ is the intercept wavelength from the UV-visible diffuse reflection spectrum. The Eg values of pure TiO2, TiO2/0.25 wt% GeO2, TiO2/0.5 wt% GeO2, TiO2/1.0 wt% GeO2, TiO2/1.5 wt% GeO2, and TiO2/2.0 wt% GeO2 are 3.03, 2.92, 2.97, 2.98, 2.95, and 2.96 eV, respectively. It is apparent that all the TiO2/GeO2 nanocrystallites have a lower Eg value than pure TiO2, which indicates that the injection of photoelectrons from the excited state of the N719 dye to the CB of TiO2 becomes easier as GeO2 increases.
The Raman spectra of pure TiO2 and the TiO2/GeO2 nanocrystallites are shown in Fig. 3(a). The characteristic bands of pure TiO2 at 396, 514, and 639 cm−1 are attributed to the B1g(1), A1g/B1g(2), and Eg(3) modes of the anatase phase. No characteristic peak at 440 cm−1 is observed,21 indicating that Ge4+ may be present in the substitution positions in the crystal lattice of TiO2. The decrease in peak intensity is associated with the lowering of the anatase TiO2 lattice symmetry induced by the doping of Ge4+ ions.22 The decrease in the Raman peak intensity also suggests that the host lattice of TiO2 is dislocated and distorted by doping with Ge4+ after the annealing treatment.23

Dye illumination and excitation have a profound influence on the electron density in the CB of TiO2 and, consequently, the power conversion efficiency of the DSSC.24 In general, simulated sunlight with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 is used as a standard light intensity to assess photovoltaic performance. From Fig. 3(b) we can determine the light intensity penetrating the FTO/10 μm TiO2 film, which shows that the dye molecules adsorbed on the outer TiO2 layer are only illuminated by 30 mW cm−2 of light. However, the light intensity across the TiO2/GeO2 film is about 40 mW cm−2. This increase in light intensity of 10% is attributed to interference effects from reflected light beams at the TiO2/GeO2 and GeO2/air (electrolyte) interfaces (Fig. 4), which give rise to an enhanced light intensity for dye illumination and excitation. The density of electrons injected from the excited dye to the CB of TiO2 is therefore increased. The interference effect between reflected light from the TiO2/GeO2 and GeO2/air (electrolyte) interfaces corresponds to the good matching of  (∼1.60) with nGeO2 (1.99), which can be fitted by the program given in the ESI.†

Fig. 5(a) shows the J–V curves of the DSSCs from pure TiO2 and TiO2/GeO2 nanocrystallite photo-anodes; the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The DSSC containing pure TiO2 nanocrystallites has a Jsc of 12.80 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.715 V, an FF of 66.1%, and a η of 7.06%. Most of these parameters are enhanced by using TiO2/GeO2 anodes. The optimum photovoltaic performance is obtained from the DSSC with TiO2/0.5 wt% GeO2:Jsc = 14.31 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.743 V, FF = 74.4%, and η = 7.91%.

There are only a few studies on the use of TiO2/GeO2 nanocrystallites as anode materials for DSSC applications. Kitiyanan et al.25 reported the synthesis of TiO2/GeO2 crystallites obtained by adjusting the Ti/Ge ratios using a sol–gel method.5 An optimum η value of ∼6.0% was determined at a Ti/Ge ratio of 9:1. In comparison with previously published values, an efficiency of 7.91% is impressive for a robust DSSC device using TiO2/GeO2 anodes. The Jsc value reflects the density of electrons injected from the excited state of the dye to the CB of TiO2. A low illumination intensity and poor excitation efficiency have previously been tremendous obstacles to overcoming current loss. Fig. 4 shows that both these problems can be solved by using TiO2/GeO2 anodes. In addition, the injection of electrons from the excited dye to the CB of TiO2 becomes facile because of the decrease in the energy of the CB level. All of these factors result in an enhancement of the Jsc value. The maximum Voc value is determined by the difference between the quasi-Fermi energy of the electrons in TiO2 and the redox potential energy of the electrolyte.26 However, the real Voc value of a DSSC is generally smaller than this theoretical limit. One of the reasons for this is a backward reaction between the electrons and the redox electrolyte.27,28 From the J–V characteristics obtained in the dark (Fig. 5(b)), it is apparent that the DSSC using the TiO2/0.5 wt% GeO2 anode has the smallest dark current density at the same voltage. The dark current density in DSSCs is attributed to the combination of the tri-iodides with the electrons in the CB of TiO2 at the TiO2/electrolyte interface.29 The smaller dark current density indicates that the reduction of the tri-iodides on the TiO2/electrolyte interface is retarded. This is a key factor for the highest Voc value for the DSSC based on the TiO2/0.5 wt% GeO2. The relatively high FF is highly dependent on the charge-transfer ability of the anode. From the EIS plots of DSSCs in Fig. 6(a) and Rct2 in Table 3, the TiO2/0.5 wt% GeO2 anode can be seen to have the lowest charge-transfer resistance (6.95 Ω cm2) compared with the pure TiO2 anode (11.76 Ω cm2). Therefore the DSSC with the TiO2/0.5 wt% GeO2 anode has the highest FF.

From Table 3, it is apparent that the W value for the TiO2/0.5 wt% GeO2 nanocrystallite anode is the lowest, indicating that the diffusion kinetics of the I−/I3− redox species within the mesoporous structure and the region between the anode and the counter electrode are more facile than for the other TiO2/GeO2 anodes and pure TiO2. The facile diffusion of the I−/I3− redox species can accelerate the recovery of dye molecules as well as the reduction reaction of the I3− ions. τ = 1/fp(4)
To determine the dependence of the lifetime of electrons on the nanocrystallite anodes (Fig. 6(b)), we calculated the lifetime using eqn (4) (ref. 30) (see Table 3). The electrons in the DSSC based on the pure TiO2 anode have an average lifetime of 30.28 ms, which is lower than the lifetimes of 31.03 ms for TiO2/0.25 wt% GeO2, 58.75 ms for TiO2/0.5 wt% GeO2, 45.12 ms for TiO2/1.0 wt% GeO2, and 33.20 ms for TiO2/1.5 wt% GeO2. The enhanced electron lifetime in the DSSCs based on the mesoporous TiO2/GeO2 anode can be attributed to the rapid electron transfer along connected conducting channels from the TiO2 nanoparticles and the easy flow of electrons from the excited dye to the decreased CB level of TiO2. Therefore we may conclude that the design of the mesoporous TiO2/GeO2 anodes is an efficient approach to accelerating electron transfer, increasing the electron density and enhancing the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs.

Fig. 7(a) shows the EIS spectra of the DSSC based on the TiO2/0.5 wt% GeO2 anode to examine the electrochemical stability of the mesoporous anode. The value of Rct2 increases from 6.95 Ω cm2 when fresh to 17.58 Ω cm2 after aging for four days. The increase in Rct2 may result from the evaporation of acetonitrile and leakage of the liquid electrolyte, which is a problem in the long-term stability of DSSCs using liquid electrolytes. Fig. 7(b) shows the stability of the DSSC using the TiO2/0.5 wt% GeO2 anode; a decrease in normalized efficiency from 100 to 87.3% over 72 h is apparent. This indicates that the mesoporous TiO2/GeO2 anodes are relatively stable against aging.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have shown that the combination of TiO2 with GeO2 is an effective strategy to enhance dye illumination and excitation in DSSCs, enhancing both electron transfer from the excited state of the dye to the CB of TiO2 and the electron density of the CB of TiO2. The DSSC based on the TiO2/0.5 wt% GeO2 nanocrystallite provides an impressive power conversion efficiency of 7.91%, compared with 6.05% from the DSSC based on a pure TiO2 anode. The work presented here is far from optimized, but these advantages, along with the simple synthesis and scalable materials, suggest that these new nanocrystallites are strong candidates for use in robust DSSCs.
