E-mail: Nripan@ntu.edu.sgReceived 27th August 2013, Accepted 7th October 2013First published on 8th October 2013AbstractA ZnO compact layer formed by electrodeposition and ZnO nanorods grown by chemical bath deposition (CBD) allow the processing of low-temperature, solution based and flexible solid state perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells. Conversion efficiencies of 8.90% were achieved on rigid substrates while the flexible ones yielded 2.62%.Solid-state organic–inorganic perovskite (CH3NH3)PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) based nanostructured solar cells have recently gained a lot of attention due to their superior performance and ease of fabrication.1–9 A power conversion efficiency of ∼17% has been identified as a realistic target, considering a short-circuit photocurrent density of 22 mA cm−2 (based on a 1.5 eV bandgap), a photovoltage of 1.1 V and a fill factor of 0.7.10 At the lab scale, power conversion efficiencies of 15% have already been achieved utilizing a solution based two-step method to deposit the perovskite.1 Now that it has been shown conclusively that the CH3NH3PbX3 perovskite layers can form highly efficient solar cells, efforts must be focused on technologically relevant challenges.Although the high efficiencies achieved are commendable, a cost effective low cost roll-to-roll production of solid state devices is only possible when the processing temperatures are brought down to 100–150 °C.11–13 A low temperature approach can have other interesting advantages such as the fabrication of flexible devices, due to the instability of plastic substrates at high temperatures. Efforts have been made to lower the processing temperature of the porous metal oxide film.14 In this regard, Al2O3 was successfully employed as a scaffold for the perovskite absorbing layer with an annealing temperature as low as 150 °C and a conversion efficiency of 12.3% was obtained.14 Nevertheless, the TiO2 compact layer used between the conducting substrate and the scaffold (Al2O3) requires high temperature sintering at 450–500 °C,1,14,15 making it incompatible with plastic substrates. In the context of dye-sensitized solar cells, low temperature electrophoretic deposition has been widely employed to fabricate mesoporous TiO2 and nano-porous ZnO on flexible indium-tin oxide (ITO) coated poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET).12,13,16 Other methods include anodization of sputtered titanium film for obtaining nanotubes directly on the Kapton HN substrate, but high temperature annealing was again necessary to obtain reasonable efficiencies (3.5%).17 More recently, Snaith et al. have developed a high electron mobility TiO2 mesoporous single crystal approach, which in combination with a spuncoated blocking layer yielded efficiencies of 7.28% with the perovskite absorber.18ZnO is a viable alternative to TiO2 for these classes of solar cells due to its comparable energy levels as well as good electron transport properties.19–21 The feasibility of electrodepositing ZnO raises the possibility of eliminating the high temperature processed TiO2 compact layer.22–24 It has already been demonstrated that growing ZnO nanorods by chemical bath deposition (CBD) on electrodeposited ZnO can lead to both electrical and optical enhancements.23 Here, we demonstrate complete low temperature processed (<100 °C) highly efficient perovskite solar cells with performance superseding previous reports.18 By utilizing electrodeposited ZnO as a compact layer and CBD grown nanorods, we extend this process to flexible devices as well resulting in promising performance.The device configuration is presented in Fig. 1(a). The ZnO nanorod film which acts as the electron transporting material and scaffold for the deposition of mesoscopic perovskite is grown on top of the ZnO compact layer. The compact layer functions as a hole blocking layer, preventing the recombination of electrons in FTO/ITO with the holes in spiro-MeOTAD. The planar (compact) ZnO film consists of angular grains which vary between 50–200 nm (Fig. 2(a)). This morphology is typical of such films as presented in previous reports.24 The typical diameters of the ZnO nanorods grown on the ZnO film are in the range of 100–150 nm and the lengths were between 400–500 nm (Fig. 2(d)). The difference in the morphology between these substrates has a direct impact on the loading of PbI2 (Fig. S2, ESI†), where the increased loading of PbI2 on the nanorods is evident. The poorer loading of PbI2 on the planar ZnO translates into a less homogeneous structure when it is converted into the perovskite. This is confirmed by Fig. 2(b) and (e) which represents the cross-section of the perovskite islands on the planar ZnO layers as well as on the ZnO nanorod sample. It is clear from the SEM images that the perovskite islands are bigger in size and perpendicular to the planar ZnO substrate as compared to the nanorod sample. Similar substrate dependence of perovskite island formation has been shown previously.1,6 Fig. 1  (a) Schematic illustration of the architecture for the perovskite devices fabricated in this work, (b) device on the FTO substrate, and (c) device on the flexible PET/ITO substrate.  Fig. 2  FESEM images of (a) top view of the ZnO compact layer electrodeposited on FTO (inset shows high resolution image), (b) cross-sectional view of perovskite islands on the ZnO compact layer, (c) cross-sectional view of the complete planar ZnO device; FTO (blue), ZnO BL (red), perovskite + spiro (light green), gold (yellow) (d) top view of ZnO nanorods grown on the ZnO compact layer on the FTO substrate, (e) cross-sectional view of perovskite islands on ZnO nanorods, and (f) cross-sectional view of the complete ZnO nanorod device; FTO (blue), ZnO BL (red), ZnO nanorod + perovskite (purple), spiro (green), gold (yellow). As the perovskite overlayer on planar devices was found to be thicker (and rougher) compared to the one on the nanorod samples, the optimum spiro-OMeTAD concentration used for the nanorod sample was lower (90 mg ml−1) compared to planar devices (120 mg ml−1). The cross-section of the full device fabricated on FTO is shown in Fig. 2(c) and (f). Similar procedures were followed for the fabrication of perovskite solar cells on flexible substrates (PET/ITO). Details of the physical characterization of the ZnO compact layer on PET/ITO are provided in the ESI† (Fig. S1). Fig. S3(a) and (b) (ESI†) depicts the top view of the ZnO compact layer and the ZnO nanorods on the PET/ITO substrate. It is interesting to note that solar cells fabricated with both planar devices and nanorods on flexible substrates yielded better performance with 120 mg ml−1 of spiro-OMeTAD. This could be again attributed to a less homogeneous perovskite overlayer on these substrates.Photovoltaic characteristics (J–V plots) of the devices fabricated on FTO and PET/ITO are presented in Fig. 3(a). The photovoltaic parameters obtained are tabulated in Table 1. The performance of the devices fabricated on FTO in general supersedes the devices fabricated on PET/ITO, which is attributed to the inherent sheet resistance of the substrates used. However, the nanorod device (Jsc = 16.98 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.02 V, FF = 51.11%, η = 8.90%) demonstrates higher conversion efficiency than the planar device (Jsc = 11.27 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.08 V, FF = 45.44%, η = 5.54%) on FTO. The less irregular perovskite overlayer permits a thinner spiro-OMeTAD overlayer on the nanorod sample and this effect is reflected in the measured fill factors. The FTO-nanorod based device has a fill factor of 51.11% compared to the FTO-planar device, which has a fill factor of 45.44%. Such an improvement of the nanorod device compared to the planar device is also observed for the PET/ITO substrates. However, the inherent high sheet resistance (60 Ω sq−1) of PET/ITO substrates plays a detrimental role. Other effects of the high sheet resistance could be non-uniformity in the electrodeposited ZnO blocking layer, which leads to lower dark current onset and consequently lower Voc of the PET/ITO substrates. Despite the differences in the substrates, the Voc values of the ZnO nanorod devices are lower compared to the planar devices where bulk of the electron transport occurs within the perovskite. This is similar to previous reports where ZrO2 and Al2O3 were used as non-injecting scaffold layers and electron transport occurred within the perovskite.14,25 The photovoltaic parameters (Jsc and Voc) as a function of light intensity are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). A linear relationship of the current density versus light intensity indicates that collection efficiency is independent of light intensity, ruling out space-charge effects.25 Fig. 3  (a) J–V plots of (i) FTO planar device, (ii) FTO nanorod device (iii) PET/ITO planar device, (iv) PET/ITO nanorod device; (b) IPCE action spectra of (i) FTO planar device, (ii) FTO nanorod device (iii) PET/ITO planar device, (iv) PET/ITO nanorod device; (c) total transmittance measured using an integrating sphere, (d) absorbed photon-to-current conversion efficiency (APCE) for the devices.

The observed effect is validated by the IPCE action spectra shown in Fig. 3(b). The Jsc value calculated from the IPCE data correlates with the Jsc value calculated from the J–V plots, tabulated in Table 1. The shape of the IPCE spectrum for devices on the FTO substrate is in agreement with the shapes reported in the literature as well.1 However, there is a slight discrepancy in the shape of the IPCE spectrum for devices on flexible PET/ITO substrates in the wavelength region of 400–600 nm as seen in Fig. 3(b). This discrepancy in shape can be understood by considering the transmittance data of ZnO on various substrates plotted in Fig. 3(c). As can be seen, the transmittance for both the planar device and the nanorod ZnO sample on the PET/ITO substrate decreases by ∼30% (at λ = 500 nm) compared to the ZnO on the FTO substrate. Due to this reason, the IPCE is limited at shorter wavelengths (λ = 400–600 nm) for the flexible PET/ITO devices. Diffuse transmittance measurement (Fig. S5, ESI†) on the ZnO substrate alone proves that nanorod morphology increases the light scattering in both FTO and flexible PET/ITO substrates. Hence, increment in the Jsc value for the nanorod morphology can be attributed to better charge generation and collection efficiency due to increased light scattering and a larger heterojunction interface. The charge collection efficiency of the ZnO nanorods is clearly seen in the FTO nanorod device which achieves high APCE values of over 90% at shorter wavelengths; see Fig. 3(d).Nanorod-based devices systematically present lower Voc than the planar ones, regardless of the higher charge generation as seen in the short circuit currents measured. In order to elucidate this loss in voltage, impedance spectroscopy was performed for both nanorods and planar devices on FTO under white LED illumination. The intensity of the white LED illumination was tuned so that the obtained Jsc in the devices matched the one obtained under AM1.5G illumination. Interestingly, the measured spectra were described by a single arc and a lower frequency feature as seen in Fig. 4(a), in contrast to previous reports on TiO2 based devices,26–28 which featured additional components. The recombination resistance extracted from the fitting of the arc (Fig. 4(b)) shows higher recombination in the nanorod-based devices, which justifies the difference in Voc. This increased recombination could occur due to the higher interfacial area. Fig. 4  (a) Examples of Nyquist plots obtained from the IS measurement of planar and nanorods devices on FTO at different applied voltages under illumination (the solid lines correspond to the fitting) and (b) recombination resistance extracted from the fitting of the arc at lower frequencies. We have demonstrated a simple yet potent methodology to fabricate complete low temperature processed perovskite solid state solar cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the foremost demonstration of perovskite solar cells employing the ZnO compact layer as a hole blocking layer and a mesoscopic scaffold layer as an electron transporter. Remarkable power conversion efficiencies of 8.90% were achieved on FTO based substrates and 2.62% on flexible PET/ITO based substrates. Additionally, the present work indicates the suitability of low temperature planar ZnO as an underlayer for perovskite solar cells opening interesting possibilities. Increasing the amount of perovskite deposited on the planar layer and its homogeneity will therefore be a promising method to increase the efficiency.We thank Mr Julianto Chua and Ms Pham Thi Thu Trang for valuable scientific discussions.Notes and referencesJ.
