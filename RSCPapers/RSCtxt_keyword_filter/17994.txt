    , Accepted 21st November 2019First published on 25th November 2019AbstractOvercoming the toxicity of hybrid organic/inorganic perovskite materials is one of the main challenges to be addressed to deploy their use in commercial optoelectronic devices. Here we demonstrate Cu–Pb binary perovskite films and their integration in solar cells. After doping the MAPbI3 films with a suitable amount of Cu, the crystal structure evolves from twisted tetragonal to cubic. This indicates that the geometric symmetry of the crystal structure improves significantly, a very challenging feat for B-site doping of perovskite films. The improved crystal quality, flatter surface morphology with typical grain sizes up to 2 μm and the six fold increase in photoluminescence intensity are attributed to this change in crystal structure. The blue-shift of emission compared to standard MAPbI3 films can be attributed to Cu doping based on the density-of-states (DOS) results from first-principle calculations and enhanced Pb–I interaction inferred from XPS results. On the other hand, upon doping the n-type carrier concentration decreases by two orders of magnitude despite the improved crystal quality, which is ascribed to the self-compensation of the Cu+ p-type dopant. A power-conversion efficiency of 5.1% with suppressed hysteresis was achieved for MAPb0.9Cu0.1I3−2xCl2x planar solar cells. Overall, doping with Cu reveals surprising effects that can be traced to structural variations that in turn cause changes in properties. These insights are promising towards optimizing the properties of Cu doped MAPbI3 films with reduced toxicity for use in future optoelectronic technologies.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHP, MAPbX3) exhibit excellent electronic and optoelectronic properties such as wide absorption spectrum, high carrier mobility, large extinction coefficient, and bipolar charge transport.1–3 On this basis, they have been used as active layers in numerous photonic technologies, including solar cells,4 light-emitting diodes,5 photodetectors6 and lasers.7,8 For instance, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells has grown very rapidly from 3.8% (2009) to 24.2% (2019).9–13 Such unprecedented improvement in performance has prompted a wealth of studies geared towards their use in commercial technologies. However, there are still several major challenges that need to be addressed before their widespread deployment, including long-term stability as well as toxicity caused by lead.
A number of recent studies has focused on designing OIHP materials with improved optoelectronic properties by elemental doping, such as the controlled substitution of I− with Cl− or Br−,14–20 or Pb2+ with Sn2+.21–23 Sn is considered as one of the most promising replacements for Pb in OIHP materials. For instance, MASnI3−xBrx thin films exhibit very promising optoelectronic properties, in particular narrow bandgaps (1.2–1.4 eV)24 and high carrier density (1014 to 1017 cm−3).21,25 The record PCE of MAPb0.75Sn0.25I3 perovskite solar cells is currently 14%.25 Unfortunately, Sn is also toxic to some extent. Therefore, it is necessary to explore alternative doping elements to substitute Pb, while maintaining good optical and electronic properties in OIHP films.
However, the perovskite symmetry is known to play a critical role in determining both the structural stability and the optical/electronic properties.26 Partial substitution of Pb with a non-toxic element leads to a distortion of the crystal structure of the perovskite due to the difference in radius, which causes a major challenge for maintaining device performance. Thus, identifying suitable environmentally friendly elements to replace lead (Pb) is a crucial step towards commercialization. The Goldschmidt model provides a good theoretical estimation of the stability of the ABX3 perovskite by comparing the ionic radii of the A, B, and X elements in OIHP films. If A = MA and X = I or Br, the metal anion of the B site can only be selected from a limited set of elements.27 The three-dimensional (3D) structural stability of OIHP materials is determined by the following tolerance factor,  where rA, rB and rX are the radii of the ions at the A, B and X positions in the ABX3 structure, respectively. Copper is a relatively common doping element in semiconductors. It presents advantages such as low toxicity, low cost and abundant supply. MACuI3 is expected to form highly stable and perfect cubic structure perovskites since its tolerance factor is 0.972, within the range of 0.89–1.0.28 At the same time, the results of theoretical calculations show that Cu can form stable perovskite structures.29 In particular, its tolerance factor is higher than that of MAPbI3 (0.82). On this basis, we anticipated that 3D Cu–Pb binary perovskite films would be stable with enhanced geometric symmetry and could be used as active layers in optoelectronic devices. Until now, the effect of partially substituting Pb with 10% Cu+ on the optical and photovoltaic properties of MAPbI3 has revealed that the incorporation of monovalent Cu+ ions does not improve solar cell performance.30 Although the radius of Cu2+ (72 pm) is smaller than that of Cu+ (96 pm), Cu+ is not as chemically stable as Cu2+ and the 2+ charge state in Cu2+ is much more suitable to satisfy the charge neutrality of OIHP. Thus, Cu2+ doping may represent an effective strategy to lower the toxicity of OIHP materials and attain other beneficial properties.
Common sources of divalent copper include Cu (AC)2 and CuCl2. The –COOH groups with large radius are not easy to incorporate into the framework of perovskite precursors. On the other hand, there is evidence to the effect that Cl doping in OIHP can significantly tune the crystallinity, morphology and particle size of the obtained films, and prolong the carrier transport length, which is beneficial for significantly enhancing photovoltaic performance.31 Thus, CuCl2 was selected as source of divalent copper in this work. Through doping with Cu2+, we demonstrate the growth of 3D Cu–Pb binary perovskite films, unveil the evolution of perovskite structure via doping concentration of a suitable non-toxic element and build structure/property relationships of the non-toxic element with the optical/electronic properties of perovskite films.
Results and discussion
MAPb0.9Cu0.1I3−2xCl2x films were first selected to optimize the synthesis technique to obtain high-quality films. The detailed preparation process is described in the ESI.† The total volume of dimethyl sulfoxide/dimethylformamide (DMF/DMSO) mixture solvent is 1 mL. According to our previous report, the optimized volume ratio of DMF:DMSO for preparing MAPbI3 films is 7:3.32 Thus, the volume ratio of DMF:DMSO in this case was adjusted systematically to be 5:5, 6:4, 7:3, 8:2, 9:1 and 10:0. The corresponding SEM images of all films were shown in Fig. S1,† indicating that the morphology of the MAPb0.9Cu0.1I3−2xCl2x perovskite film can be controlled by DMF/DMSO ratio. In our case, a film with better morphology can be obtained when the DMF/DMSO ratio is set to be 9:1. To further improve the quality of MAPb0.9Cu0.1I3−2xCl2x films, chlorobenzene was used as anti-solvent to treat MAPb0.9Cu0.1I3−2xCl2x films prepared with DMF:DMSO volume ratio of 7:3 and 9:1. The corresponding SEM images shown in Fig. S2† demonstrate that the leaf-like MAPb0.9Cu0.1I3−2xCl2x films prepared with DMF:DMSO volume ratio of 7:3 turn into flat discontinuous films after using the chlorobenzene treatment. Meanwhile, the MAPb0.9Cu0.1I3−2xCl2x films prepared with DMF:DMSO volume ratio of 9:1 turn into flat and compact films with few pinholes.
According to previous reports, both DMSO and Cl− have the effect of delaying the crystallization of perovskite films.33,34 In most cases concerning MAPbI3, an appropriate amount of DMSO is helpful to form a flat film. However, in the case of MAPb0.9Cu0.1I3−2xCl2x films, the introduction of Cl ions slows down the crystallization rate to a certain extent. If the amount of DMSO of MAPb0.9Cu0.1I3−2xCl2x is the same as that of MAPbI3, the crystallization rate will be too slow to obtain the MAPb0.9Cu0.1I3−2xCl2x film with high crystal quality. Even though the addition of chlorobenzene can promote the crystallization process,35,36 the film is not able to be compact. Therefore, the experimental results show that a proper reduction in the amount of DMSO is more conducive to form compact thin films of MAPb0.9Cu0.1I3−2xCl2x. Thus, we synthesized MAPb0.9Cu0.1I3−2xCl2x perovskite films via 9:1 volume ratio of DMF:DMSO combined with a chlorobenzene treatment process.

Fig. 1 illustrates the SEM images of MAPb1−xCuxI3−2xCl2x (x = 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.25) films to reveal the effects of Cu doping concentration on morphology. The Cu doping concentration was controlled by adding a suitable amount of CuCl2. As shown in Fig. 1a, the MAPbI3 thin films are dense yet not uniform in terms of grain size. By increasing the Cu doping concentration to 10%, the flatness of the MAPb1−xCuxI3−2xCl2x perovskite films improved slightly, while the grain size kept increasing and the maximum grain size was found to be about 2 μm in the MAPb0.9Cu0.1I3−2xCl2x film, which is more than three times the maximum grain size measured for MAPbI3. However, to further increase the Cu doping concentration results in nonuniform films again.

To more accurately confirm the elemental composition of the sample, EDS was performed on the MAPb0.9Cu0.1I3−2xCl2x film. Fig. 2a displays the top-view SEM image of the MAPb0.9Cu0.1I3−2xCl2x film. The EDS layering diagram in Fig. 2b conclusively demonstrates the presence of elemental C, N, Pb, I, Cu, and Cl in the films. Fig. 2c–g show the EDS of the C, N, Pb, I, Cu, and Cl elements, respectively, demonstrating that each element is uniformly distributed in the MAPb0.9Cu0.1I3−2xCl2x film. To further demonstrate the uniformity of all elements in the samples, we acquired cross-sectional SEM images and EDS spectra of perovskite films with 10% and 40% Cu doping concentration (Fig. S3a and b†). We find that elemental Cu element is uniformly distributed as a dopant in the perovskite layer.

The chemical composition and valence state of the doping elements in the MAPb0.9Cu0.1I3−2xCl2x film was further analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The C, N, Pb, I, Cu, Cl elements are contained in the XPS survey spectrum of MAPb0.9Cu0.1I3−2xCl2x film shown in Fig. 3a, indicating Cu and Cl elements have been successfully introduced into the perovskite films. Fig. 3b and c show the Pb 4f and I 3d XPS spectra of MAPbI3 and MAPb0.9Cu0.1I3−2xCl2x films, respectively. The binding energy of Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 shifts from the initial values of 136.75 eV and 141.61 eV in MAPbI3 film to 138.23 eV and 143.10 eV in MAPb0.9Cu0.1I3−2xCl2x film, respectively. Meanwhile, the binding energy of I 3d5/2 and I 3d3/2 shifts from the initial values of 617.60 eV and 629.10 eV in the MAPbI3 film to 619.20 eV and 630.72 eV in the MAPb0.9Cu0.1I3−2xCl2x film, respectively. That is to say, both Pb 4f and I 3d shift toward higher binding energy after Cu and Cl are incorporated into the MAPbI3 lattice, which results in a stronger interaction between Pb and I. As shown in Fig. 3d, the binding energy at 199.7 eV and 197.9 eV can be assigned to the core lines of Cl 2p1/2 and Cl 2p3/2, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3e, the binding energy of Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 are located at 930.28 eV, 932.10 eV and 952.1 eV. The presence of satellite peaks at 944.80 eV indicates the presence of Cu2+, which means that copper is mainly present in perovskite films as a bivalent ion.37 However, due to the similar peak position of Cu+ and Cu2+, the existence of Cu+ in the films cannot be excluded. The formation of Cu+ ion is mainly due to the strong reducibility of the I− ion, which reduces part of Cu2+ to Cu+. Cu+ ions usually serve as trap states and their presence overall degrades the stability of perovskite films.38 Therefore, avoiding the formation of Cu+ related impurities such as CuI in the 3D Cu–Pb perovskite film is crucial for achieving better performance in photovoltaic applications. To assess the presence of CuI in our samples, we acquired top-view SEM images of films with 30% and 40% Cu doping concentration (Fig. S4a and b†), respectively. For 40% doping, a small amount of white irregular particles appears on the top surface (Fig. S4b†). We carried out an EDS surface scan focusing on one such particle (Fig. S4d†). The main constituent elements are determined to include a large amount of Cu and O, and a small amount of I element. The main reason is that Cu and Pb have different saturation in perovskite, so that excessive Cu doping leads to the formation of substance containing Cu, I, O elements. We also acquired XRD patterns for the 30% and 40% Cu doped perovskite films (Fig. S4c†). The XRD pattern of 40% Cu doped perovskite films indicates the formation of an impurity phase, consistent with SEM results. However, neither such complex impurity nor CuI was found in the 30% Cu doped perovskite films. The sample maintained the perovskite phase and no impurity phase appeared. Therefore, we conclude that when the Cu doping concentration is less than 30%, a pure phase perovskite film is obtained without forming CuI, or the quantity of CuI is lower than the detection limit of XRD.

The XRD patterns of MAPb1−xCuxI3−2xCl2x (x = 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.25) films (Fig. 4) reveal the influence of doping concentration on their crystal structures. As shown in Fig. 4a, the strong characteristic diffraction peaks located at 13.9°, 28.25° and 31.71° in the XRD pattern of MAPbI3 corresponds to the (110), (220) and (310) crystal planes of the tetragonal perovskite structure, respectively, and the (110) plane is preferentially oriented, which is consistent with previous work.39 According to the Bragg equation 2dsinθ = nλ, the diffraction peak positions of MAPb1−xCuxI3−2xCl2x shift to higher angle since the radii of Cu (72 pm) and Cl (181 pm) are smaller than Pb (120 pm) and I (216 pm). To better visualize this effect, the magnified XRD patterns of diffraction peaks corresponding to the (110) and (220) crystal planes are displayed in Fig. 4b. The peak positions keep moving towards a large angle along with the increase of Cu doping concentration. When the doping concentration reaches 10%, two additional diffraction peaks in the XRD patterns of MAPb1−xCuxI3−2xCl2x can be detected, as highlighted in Fig. 4a. The corresponding enlarged XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 4c for detailed analysis. According to previous reports, the diffraction peak appearing at 10.4° can be assigned to PbI2 and the diffraction peak at 15.43° refers to the (100) plane of MAPbCl3.31 An appropriate amount (<5%) of PbI2 within MAPbI3 is known to passivate the grain boundaries and further improve crystal quality,40,41 which partly explains the best crystal quality of MAPb0.9Cu0.1I2.8Cl0.2 in our case. In addition, to further explore the relationship between the doping concentration and the content of MAPbCl3, the peak intensity ratio between the (100) plane of MAPbCl3 and the (110) plane of MAPbI3 (IMAPbCl3/IMAPbI3) via Cu doping concentration is summarized in Fig. 4d. IMAPbCl3/IMAPbI3 exhibits a continuously rising tendency when the Cu doping concentration exceeds 10%, which proves that the relative content of MAPbCl3 increases. The incorporation of a small amount of Cl into MAPbI3 was previously reported to cause the diffraction peak of MAPbI3 move to a large angle, but only relatively low concentration levels (about 6%) of Cl elements can be incorporated into the MAPbI3 structure.31 When the Cl content in the perovskite precursor solution further increases, the extra Cl element will no longer enter the MAPbI3 structure, but rather participate in the formation of MAPbCl3, so that the (100) and (200) peaks of MAPbCl3 appear in the XRD pattern. Meanwhile, the diffraction peaks of MAPbI3 will not shift any further.31 In our case, the XRD diffraction peak appearing at 15.13° belongs to the MAPbCl3 (100) crystal plane, which shows that the Cl element reaches a saturation value in the MAPbI3 structure at 10% Cu doping concentration. However, the continuous shift to larger degree of diffraction peaks still observed in the XRD patterns, even though Cl is saturated in the MAPbI3 structure, which is not consistent with previous results.31 The doping concentration saturation of elemental Cu and Cl in the crystal structure of MAPbI3 should be different. Since the atomic ratio of Cu:Cl is 1:2 in the divalent copper precursor, even though Cl dopant is saturated in the MAPbI3 structure, Cu dopants can continuously incorporate into the crystal structure of the perovskite, resulting in a continuous shift of the peak position and a small amount of PbI2 impurities.

In addition, as shown in Fig. 4a, the intensities of the (110) and (220) XRD diffraction peaks of MAPb1−xCuxI3−2xCl2x exhibit a significant variation via Cu doping concentration, i.e. firstly enhancing to the maximum value when Cu doping concentration is 10%, and then quenching again when further increasing the Cu doping concentration. At 10% Cu doping concentration the intensity of the diffraction peak reaches a maximum, which is nearly ten times that of MAPbI3, indicating good crystal quality. However, when the Cu doping concentration is further increased, the diffraction peak intensity of the MAPb1−xCuxI3−2xCl2x film sharply decreases by a factor of 2/3, indicating that the crystal quality of MAPb1−xCuxI3−2xCl2x films degrades. This can be tentatively ascribed to the precipitation of more PbI2.42
Closer inspection of the (220) diffraction peak in Fig. 4 shows that it is asymmetrical. Two Gaussian curves are necessary to properly fit the (220) diffraction peak, and the fitting results are shown in Fig. 4e. One of the fitting peaks located at lower angles (28.13°) can be assigned to the (004) plane of MAPbI3.17 Seok et al. pointed out that an increase in symmetry will result in a gradual disappearance of the (004) plane in their study of Br-doped perovskite solar cells. Herein, the change in the symmetry characteristics of all films was evaluated using the relative intensity ratio between (004) and (220), i.e., I(004)/I(220). The I(004)/I(220) value is 0.17, 0.09, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.17 corresponding to the MAPb1−xCuxI3−2xCl2x films with Cu doping concentration of 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%, respectively. The symmetry first increases and then decreases with the increase of Cu doping concentration. A Cu doping concentration of 10% yields the most symmetric peak, which is very close to the cubic structure.
Based on the Jahn–Teller38,43,44 we would expect Cu-based octahedral distortion, resulting in a purely two-dimensional perovskite structure. However, in our work, as shown in Fig. 4 and S4c,† the 5–30% Cu doped perovskite films only exhibit peaks that are characteristic of a 3D perovskite structure. This means that in perovskite films with less than 30% Cu doping, the Jahn–Teller effect, if present, is negligible. However, although the Jahn–Teller effect does not change the structure, it influences the symmetry of the perovskite structure. A schematic diagram of the symmetry variation mechanism of perovskite crystal structure via Cu doping concentration is illustrated in Fig. 5. Fig. 5a displays the schematic structural change with respect to an increase of Cu doping concentration. Fig. 5b shows a scheme of morphology changes with increasing doping concentration and corresponding statistics of grain size distribution. The distortion of the Cu-based octahedron can be defined by the torsion angle between the octahedrons (i.e., the dihedral angle defined by the out-of-plane chloride on the adjacent copper sites, which is marked as θ in Fig. S5†). Quarti's group45 proposed that the perovskite is a twisted tetragonal structure, and the twist of the PbI6 octahedron can also be defined by the dihedral angle of the I–Pb–Pb–I group. Based on this discussion, the symmetry change exhibited by the XRD pattern may be mainly caused by the competition of the two torsional forces. As for 10% Cu-doped perovskite, the two torsional forces are well balanced, and the symmetry of the perovskite structure greatly improves. Specifically, we find that the crystallization quality increases and the grain size increases. When the doping concentration is higher than 10%, the torsional force of the Cu-based octahedron will be stronger than that of PbI6, resulting in a decrease in the symmetry of the perovskite structure. Therefore, in MAPb0.85Cu0.15I3−2xCl2x thin films, the crystal structure twists from the cubic structure to the tetragonal structure again, so that the grain size is remarkably reduced and large voids reappear. The symmetry changes caused by the torsion of the lattice structure are also the main causes of the changes in crystallinity and morphology.

The effects of different doping concentrations on the optical properties of perovskite films were investigated by PL spectra (Fig. 6). The emission peak of MAPbI3 films appears at 770 nm, which is consistent with the literature.31 With a small amount of Cu–Cl co-doping, the emission peak exhibits a sustained blue shift until the doping concentration reaches 10%, and another new emission peak appears at 428 nm. The photoluminescence center of MAPbCl3 has been revealed to be in the range of 420–448 nm, and XRD demonstrates the presence of MAPbCl3. On this basis, we attribute the emission to MAPbCl3.42,46 After the formation of the MAPbCl3 framework, the doping concentration of Cu is continuously increased, and the emission peak starts to red shift relative to MAPb0.9Cu0.1I3−2xCl2x, while it is still blue-shifted relative to MAPbI3. Rao et al. reported that a small amount of Cl doping will cause a blue shift of the PL emission peaks. However, after the formation of the MAPbCl3 framework, even when Cl doping concentration is further increased, the blue shift will be hindered.31 However, in our case, after the appearance of the emission peak from MAPbCl3, the main emission peak shifts back slightly. The UV-vis absorption spectra of MAPb1−xCuxI3−2xCl2x (x = 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.25) are shown in Fig. 6c. The corresponding Tauc curves are reported in Fig. S6.† We summarized the calculated bandgap energy as a function of doping concentration in Fig. 6d, which is consistent with the variation trend of the PL peak position in Fig. 6a. The band gap reaches a maximum value of 1.587 eV when the Cu doping concentration is 10%.

The corresponding double exponential fitting lines are presented as well; (c) UV-vis absorption spectrum of MAPb1−xCuxI3−2xCl2x; (d) band gap energy variation as a function of Cu doping concentration. 
For all doped MAPbI3 structures, the valence band is still mainly determined by the I 5p state. The conduction band mainly originates from the combination of the Pb 6p state, but the p and d states of the dopant occupying the lead site play minor roles.47,48 Therefore, we speculate that the reason for the increase of the band gap may originate from the strong interaction of Pb–I and the small contribution of the d state of Cu. The strong interaction of Pb–I can be attributed to the change of electronegativity, which is greater for Cl (3.16) than for I (2.66), so that the interaction between Cl and Pb is stronger than that of I and Pb, which causes the blue shift of emission. After the formation of the MAPbCl3 framework, additional Cl doping will not cause the blue shift any longer as reported elsewhere.31 The electronegativity (1.9) of Cu is less than the electronegativity of Pb (2.33), which finally results in a red-shift of emission.49
To verify our hypothesis of how the Cu doping changes the bandgap, we discuss the electronic structure based on state density (DOS) and projected density of states (PDOS) shown in Fig. 7. The calculated band gaps of MAPbI3 and MAPb0.75Cu0.25I3−2xCl2x are 1.57 and 1.58 eV, respectively, which are very close to the experimental values of 1.566 and 1.575 eV. As for the MAPbI3 presented in Fig. 7a, the valence band minimum (VBM) is constituted of the I 5p orbit and the conduction band maximum (CBM) is constituted of Pb 6p orbit, which is consistent with previous reports.44Fig. 7b shows the contribution of Pb, I, Cu and Cl to the VB and CB of the MAPb0.75Cu0.25I2.8Cl0.2 structure. Simulation results for the analog MAPb0.75Cu0.25I2.8Cl0.2 structure indicates that its VBM is determined by I 5p, Cu 3d and Cl 2p orbitals, and its CBM is mainly attributed to the Pb 6p and I 5p orbitals. The detailed contribution of different ions to the VBM and CBM in MAPbI3 and MAPb0.75Cu0.25I2.8Cl0.2 are compared in Fig. 7c. We can see that the CBM for both MAPbI3 and MAPb0.75Cu0.25I2.8Cl0.2 are determined by the Pb 6p and I 5p states, but the Pb 6p states play a decisive role. However, the VBM apparently originates from I5p and Pb s states for MAPbI3, but I 5p and Cu 3d states make the main contribution to the VBM of MAPb0.75Cu0.25I2.8Cl0.2. Therefore, Cu 3d states play an important role in the electronic structure of the Cu–Pb binary perovskite, which is the main reason for the change of bandgap energy.

Moreover, the blue shift of emission may also be caused by the passivation of defects. Defects in perovskite films are known to form trapping states within the bandgap, which cause spontaneous radiative recombination, thereby causing a red shift of emission, while passivation of these trap states will result in a blue shift.50 In addition, calculations by Kim et al. showed that the defective Pb and MA vacancies in MAPbI3 would generate additional charges near the valence band and form a shallow energy level near the valence band.51 A moderate amount of Cu–Cl co-doping reduces the Pb vacancy and MA vacancy in the perovskite films, weakens the activity above the valence band, and defect passivation induces a blue shift in the photoluminescence peak.52 In our case, the XRD analysis results conclusively prove that the proper amount of Cu, Cl co-doping can improve crystal quality, indicating the passivation of defects. However, further increasing the Cu doping concentration, which is similar to the situation reported by Zohar et al., the cations above the valence band increase and the peak begins red shifting.50
The variation of PL intensity is presented in Fig. 6a. After introducing Cu and Cl, the PL peak intensity of MAPbI3 was significantly enhanced. The PL intensity of the MAPb0.9Cu0.1I3−2xCl2x film is about six times higher than that of MAPbI3. Once the doping concentration exceeds 10%, the PL intensity of MAPbI3 begins quenching, while the PL intensity of MAPbCl3 begins to increase. Such variation tendency coincides with the change of crystal quality inferred from XRD results.
To study the kinetics of photogenerated carriers in Cu–Cl co-doped perovskite films, time-resolved PL (TRPL) tests were performed on MAPbI3 and MAPb0.9Cu0.1I3−2xCl2x films. The TRPL spectra of both samples were fitted with a double exponential, as shown in Fig. 6b. The decay includes two processes: fast decay (τ1) and slow decay (τ2). A1, A2 are the amplitudes of (τ1) and (τ2), respectively. The specific fitting data are shown in Table 1. The fast decay (τ1) mainly corresponds to the exciton recombination ability of the material. The slow decay (τ2) mainly corresponds to the non-radiative recombination process of the material. As the crystallinity of the Cu–Cl co-doped material is significantly improved, the exciton recombination ability is enhanced, so that τ1 decays more rapidly. On the contrary, the non-radiative recombination process is strongly suppressed due to the lower density of defects in the films, which results in a longer τ2.53 However, it is known that the two decay processes happen at the same time and in fact compete with each other. The enhanced exciton recombination process will cause less carriers to contribute to the non-recombination process. This is the main reasons why the Cu doped films possess a very small portion of τ2 compared to pristine films. Such varying tendency of τ1 and τ2via doping concentration is consistent with XRD and PL results.

MAPb0.9Cu0.1I3−2xCl2x films were used to fabricate solar cells. As shown in Fig. 8a, we used the FTO/SnO2/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD/Ag architecture. According to the cross-sectional SEM image in Fig. 8b, the thickness of SnO2, perovskite, spiro-MeOTAD and Ag layer is about 30 nm, 240 nm, 220 nm and 85 nm, respectively. Fig. 8c shows the J–V curve and Table 2 summarizes the corresponding photovoltaic parameters. Under reverse scanning mode, we measured the following photovoltaic parameters: Jsc was 14.3 mA cm−2, Voc was 0.74 V, FF was 47.8%, and PCE was 5.10%.

The EQE spectrum and integrated current density (Fig. 8d) are in good agreement with J–V results. However, the PCE of MAPb0.9Cu0.1I3−2xCl2x based PSCs was much less than 18.49% of MAPbI3 based PSCs as shown in Fig. S7.† Table S1† summarizes the photovoltaic parameters of MAPbI3 based PSCs. Both SEM and XRD results show that the crystal quality and flatness of MAPb1−xCuxI3−2xCl2x films have significantly improved compared to the pure phase, so that it should present higher PCE in principle. Thus, we deduce that the crystallization quality and morphology were not the main factors affecting the PCE of MAPb0.9Cu0.1I3−2xCl2x based PSCs.
The carrier concentration as a function of Cu doping concentration of MAPb1−xCuxI3−2xCl2x films was measured through Hall Effect measurements (Fig. 8e). Specific parameters of Hall Effect measurements show in Table S2.† After the introduction of Cu and Cl, the carrier concentration rapidly decreases. When the doping concentration reaches 10%, the carrier concentration declines by two orders of magnitude. The co-doping of Cu–Cl introduces a small amount of Cu+ ions as shown by XPS results, which acts as p-type dopants to compensate for n-doping in the original perovskite film.51,54 This is the main reason for the PCE degradation of PSCs. Meanwhile, the carrier mobility increased from 142 cm2 V−1S−1 to 406 cm2 V−1S−1, then decreased as shown in Fig. 8e. These values exhibit the same trend as the XRD and SEM results of MAPb1−xCuxI3−2xCl2x films.
According to the literature, the interface charge accumulation is the direct cause of hysteresis, so the interface charge transfer efficiency has a great influence on improving (reducing) the hysteretic behaviour.55 As shown in Fig. S7,† the hysteresis is reduced for MAPb0.9Cu0.1I3−2xCl2x based PSCs. The decreased carrier concentration and increased carrier mobility mentioned above are beneficial for reducing the charge accumulation at the interface. To further demonstrate the effect of Cu doping on the interfacial charge transfer of the perovskite layer, we acquired time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra of MAPbI3/SnO2 and MAPb1−xCuxI3−2xCl2x/SnO2 (Fig. S8†). The TRPL decay curves are fitted using a biexponential function and the corresponding fitting parameters are summarized in Table S3.† The τ1 and τ2 represent the fast decay and slow decay, respectively. A1 and A2 are the amplitudes of (τ1) and (τ2), respectively. For MAPbI3/SnO2, the decay times are 20.7 and 51.3 ns, respectively. For MAPb0.9Cu0.1I3−2xCl2x/SnO2, τ1 decreases to 1.1 ns and τ2 decreases to 24.5 ns. The τave for MAPbI3/SnO2 and MAPb0.9Cu0.1I3−2xCl2x/SnO2 is 45.8 ns and 17.8 ns, respectively, implying that Cu-doped samples achieve efficient carrier transfer. Therefore, we can conclude that the enhanced crystallization property, which promotes carrier mobility and charge transfer, is the main reason for the improvement of hysteresis in Cu-doped perovskite films.
Conclusions and perspectives
In summary, we successfully synthesized Cu–Pb 3D binary perovskite absorption layers to partially reduce the toxicity typical of MAPbI3 films. When introducing 10% Cu doping, the geometric symmetry of the perovskite crystal structure exhibits significant improvements, which consequently results in improved crystal quality, flatter surface morphology with enlarged grain size, enhanced photoluminescence intensity by a factor of six, and suppressed hysteresis in photovoltaic conversion. Although the PCE of 5.1% is still lower than that of MAPbI3 PSCs due to its degraded electronic properties, it is already quite promising and we are currently developing strategies to improve the performance parameters. Overall, the presented results confirm the possibility of using Cu–Pb binary films in technological applications such as light emitting diodes and photovoltaic devices. The unveiled interactive relationship between non-toxic dopant and properties paves the way to explore other non-toxic or lower-toxic perovskites and providing relevant concepts for further enhancing the performance of optoelectronic devices based on such systems.
