    , Accepted 26th October 2016First published on 29th October 2016AbstractSystematic investigation of the instinctive self-assembly of diblock conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) as electron transport layers (ETLs) on the arrangement and morphology of the upper active layer in polymer solar cells (PSCs) is usually ignored. The two water/alcohol-soluble diblock CPEs with different terminal ionic groups, PFEO-b-PTNBr and PFEO-b-PTImBr, offer an ohmic contact between the ITO electrode and the active layer by substantially reducing the work function of ITO via modulation of the interfacial dipoles. More intriguingly, the spontaneous self-assembly of the diblock polymers causes an ordered scolopendra-like conformation to develop on the ITO cathode. These self-assembled diblock CPEs can act as a template to further partially induce a preferable face-on orientation of the donor component. Surprisingly, n-type self-doping is observed in the two CPEs based on the p-type conjugated backbone, particularly in PFEO-b-PTImBr with imidazolium salt. As a result, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the devices based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM are remarkably enhanced to 9.0% for PFEO-b-PTNBr and 9.4% for PFEO-b-PTImBr. Intriguingly, both ZnO/PFEO-b-PTNBr and ZnO/PFEO-b-PTImBr based PTB7-Th:PC71BM devices exhibit superior PCEs compared to that of the classical published and commonly used PFN (8.42%) and PFNBr (8.38%) ETLs based devices. These results indicate that the development of self-assembled diblock CPEs opens a new point of view and provides a straightforward approach to achieve high performance polymer solar cells by simultaneously modulating the morphology of the interlayer, active layer and interfacial work function.
1. Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention because of their advantages such as lightweight, low-cost and large-area printing through low-cost solution processing.1–5 Recently, various approaches, including new materials design, morphology modulation and device structure optimization, have been used to improve the performance of PSCs.6–9 However, the mismatch energy level between the work function of the electrode and the molecular potential of the components in active layer causes a Schottky barrier between the photoactive layer and electrode.10 Appropriate interfacial engineering not only reduces the interfacial barrier, but also passivates the surface defect of the electrode, thus reducing the leakage current and enhancing the charge injection.11 Therefore the device performance can be greatly improved by inserting an interlayer between the electrode and active layer. To date, a large number of materials have been proven to be effective as interlayers in PSCs, including metal oxide semiconductors (ZnO, TiOx, and MoOx) and conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs).12–14 However, these inorganic interlayers are not interfacially compatible with the organic active layer, which results in poor electron extraction. Furthermore, most of them typically require a high-temperature annealing process, which does meet the requirement of large-scale roll-to-roll commercial application.
Alternatively, organic CPEs have attracted growing attention for PSCs, mainly because of their environment-friendly water/alcohol solution processability and effective electrode modification functions.15 CPEs consist of a delocalized π conjugated backbone and polar ionic groups on the side chain. The π conjugated main chains endow the CPEs with typical organic semiconducting properties, while the polar ionic groups make them easily soluble in water, alcohol and other polar solvents, which could avoid intermixing with the upper hydrophobic active layer. In addition, the polar side chain pendant of the CPEs can result in the formation of an aligned interfacial dipole assembly at the CPEs/metal electrode interface, which lowers the work function of cathode electrodes, thus leading to the formation of a capacitive double layer, which boosts the charge extraction and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the device.16 Recently, highly efficient PSCs using CPEs as electron transport layers have been widely reported.17 However, the current research mainly focuses on the interfacial dipole regulation of CPEs with different types of backbones, different counterions, different pendent polar groups, and self-assembled conjugated polyelectrolyte–ionic liquid crystal complexes.18–20 However, cathode interfacial morphology is also crucial for charge extraction and transfer, and the morphology of the electron transport layer can severely affect the morphology of the upper active layer as well as the final PCE, especially for inverted-structure polymer devices. To the best of our knowledge, detailed investigation of the instinctive self-assembly of diblock CPEs as electron transport layers (ETLs) and its influences on the morphology of the upper active layer and photovoltaic properties in inverted PSCs has been ignored. Meanwhile, research on the relationships between the structural assembly of CPEs ETL on the crystalline ordering, morphology and orientation of the upper active layer and final photovoltaic performance is still lacking.
Diblock copolymers are macromolecules comprised of blocks of chemically distinct backbone repeat units. It is worthy to note that diblock copolymers with different blocks can self-assemble into thermodynamically stable microphase-separated macroscopic domains of pure polymer nanostructures, which is driven by the thermodynamic incompatibility of the two blocks.21,22 An ordered morphology has been universally accepted to enhance charge carrier mobility. Thus, if a self-assembled diblock copolymer is combined with electronically active CPEs at the molecular level, the spontaneous self-assembly of the diblock polymer would further induce the upper organic active layer to assemble into a more ordered nanostructure, as well as facilitate charge separation, transportation and collection.
Ethylene oxy and ammonium/imidazolium cationic side chains are polar groups, which are quite useful for good solubility in polar water/alcohol solvents, but also for tuning the interfacial dipole and increasing the dielectric constant.16 Herein, we design and synthesize two novel diblock CPEs, poly[(9,9-bis(2′-(2′-(2′-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethyl)-2,7-fluorene)]-block-poly[3-(((6′-N,N,N-trimethylammonium)oxy)methyl)-2,5-thiophene] (PFEO-b-PTNBr) and poly[(9,9-bis(2′-(2′-(2′-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethyl)-2,7-fluorene)]-block-poly[3-(((6′-N-methylimidazole)oxy)methyl)-2,5-thiophene] (PFEO-b-PTImBr), bearing polar ethylene oxide and cationic ammonium or imidazolium side chains. We are interested in how the self-assembled diblock CPEs as an ETL influence the interfacial properties and device performance of inverted polymer solar cells. Intriguingly, diblock CPEs PFEO-b-PTNBr and PFEO-b-PTImBr ETLs not only offer an ohmic contact between the ITO electrode and the active layer, but also act as a template to partially induce a favorable face-on orientation of donor crystalline domains. It is worthy to note that this is the first reported time that diblock CPEs as ETL induce the face-on arrangement of the upper active layer. Besides, fluorene and thiophene are both p-type conjugated polymers. Generally speaking, bare p-type conjugation cannot cause n-type doping. Nevertheless, electron paramagnetic resonance signals derived from unpaired electrons are detected from both PFEO-b-PTNBr and PFEO-b-PTImBr owing to the existence of nitrogen atoms from the side chain. The enrichment of unpaired electrons on the backbone of the ETL is found to facilitate charge transport. The PCEs of the devices based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):[6,6]-phenyl-C60-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) are remarkably enhanced in comparison to the bare ITO device (PCE = 0.8%), with 3.1% for PFEO-b-PTNBr and 3.5% for PFEO-b-PTImBr, and are even superior to that of the device with classical ZnO as the ETL (PCE = 3.0%). Moreover, these PCE values are greatly improved to 9.0% and 9.4%, respectively, in an inverted device of narrow band gap polymer poly[2,6′-4,8-di(5-ethylhexylthienyl)benzo[1,2-b;3,3-b] dithiophene] [3-fluoro-2[(2-ethyl-hexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7-Th):[6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). Better yet, the two PCEs of ZnO/PFEO-b-PTNBr and ZnO/PFEO-b-PTImBr based PTB7-Th:PC71BM devices are superior to that of the classical published and commonly used PFN (8.42%) and PFNBr (8.38%) ETLs based devices.23,24 These findings demonstrate that the development of self-assembled diblock CPEs provides a new point of view and straightforward approach to achieve high performance polymer solar cells by simultaneously modulating the morphology of the active layer and interfacial contact.
2. Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The structures of the diblock polymers FEO-b-PTNBr and PFEO-b-PTImBr are shown in Chart 1 and the detailed synthetic routes of the target diblock polymers are displayed in Scheme S1 (detailed synthetic information is provided in the ESI†). The diblock polymer PFEO-b-PTBr was first prepared by the Kumada catalyst transfer coupling polymerization between 2,5-dibromo-3-(((6-bromohexyl)oxy)methyl) thiophene and 2,7-dibromo-9,9-bis(2-(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethyl)-fluorene. The weight-average molecular weight (Mw) and number-average molecular weight (Mn) of PFEO-b-PTBr were estimated by size exclusion chromatograms (SEC) to be 16600 and 13700 g mol−1, respectively, with a dispersity index of 1.21. According to 1H NMR, the final obtained precise ratio between the two blocks polyfluorene and polythiophene is 1:2. The ionized diblock polymer PFEO-b-PTNBr was obtained through quantitative quaternization of PFEO-b-PTBr with an excess of trimethylamine in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution below −78 °C with liquid nitrogen. The final step to the target diblock polyelectrolyte PFEO-b-PTImBr was the polymer-analogous quaternization of the alkyl bromide side groups with N-methylimidazole. Owing to the polar pendant groups, quaternary ammonium salt or imidazole salt, the two ionized diblock polymers PFEO-b-PTNBr and PFEO-b-PTImBr can be readily dissolved in polar solvents, such as water, methanol (CH3OH), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). In addition, all the intermediates and final diblock polymers were thoroughly purified, and the chemical structures of all the intermediates were determined using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. The final diblock polymers PFEO-b-PTBr, PFEO-b-PTNBr and PFEO-b-PTImBr were confirmed using 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (1H NMR and 13C NMR), as shown in Fig. S1–S3 (ESI†), respectively. The SEC profiles of the 1st block synthesized (polyfluorene, PFEO) in the first step and the final diblock copolymer, PFEO-b-PTBr, after the second-stage polymerization are shown in Fig. S4† (PFEO, Mn = 6.96 kDa, Mw/Mn = 1.13, PFEO-b-PTBr, Mn = 13.7 kDa, Mw/Mn = 1.21).

The UV-vis absorption spectra of the two diblock conjugated polyelectrolytes films spin-coated on ITO from methanol solutions are shown in Fig. S5.†PFEO-b-PTNBr and PFEO-b-PTImBr show analogous optical absorption profiles with an absorption maximum (λabs) at ∼520 nm and = absorption band onset (λonset) at ∼670 nm. The optical bandgaps (Eg) calculated from the absorption band onset of PFEO-b-PTNBr and PFEO-b-PTImBr are 1.84 and 1.83 eV, respectively. In addition, the optical transmittance spectra of ITO and ITO/CPE are investigated, as shown in Fig. S6.† Compared to that of bare ITO, the optical transmittance of ITO/PFEO-b-PTNBr and ITO/PFEO-b-PTImBr are almost the same, which suggests that the introduction of the diblock conjugated polyelectrolytes ETLs does not hinder the optical absorption of the active layer.
It is well known that the formation of an interfacial dipole would most likely lead to a reduction in the interface barrier between the high work function metal electrode and polymer active layer.25–28 To verify this, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (Fig. 1a and Table 1) was used to manifest the surface work function of bare ITO and the diblock conjugated polyelectrolytes modified ITO. The high binding-energy cutoff (Ecutoff) values of ITO, ITO/PFEO-b-PTNBr and ITO/PFEO-b-PTImBr are 16.98, 17.39, and 17.09 eV, respectively, and the related Eonset values are 0.61 eV for bare ITO, 0.73 eV for ITO/PFEO-b-PTNBr and 0.11 eV for ITO/PFEO-b-PTImBr. The work function value of bare ITO is 4.85 eV, which is in accordance with the published literature.29 However, there is a significant difference in the electronic properties of the CPEs/ITO interfaces. ITO/PFEO-b-PTNBr reduced the work-function of ITO by 0.29 eV, whereas ITO/PFEO-b-PTImBr decreased the work-function of ITO by 0.61 eV (Table 1). This demonstrates that amino imidazolium derivatives can provide a larger dipole moment than quaternary ammonium salt. Fig. 1b presents the energy level diagrams of the diblock CPEs/ITO interfaces on the basis of the UPS results, which illustrate the shift in the energy levels owing to the interfacial dipole of a photovoltaic device.30,31 The tunable energy levels of ITO coated with PFEO-b-PTNBr and PFEO-b-PTImBr was also confirmed by Kelvin probe microscopy (KPM), as displayed in Fig. 1c and Fig. S7.†,32 The bare ITO possesses a typical WF value of 4.70 eV, whereas ITO/PFEO-b-PTNBr and ITO/PFEO-b-PTImBr reduce the work-function of ITO by 0.28 and 0.38 eV, respectively, which is in accordance with the UPS results. The reduced work-function of ITO treated by the diblock CPEs can lower the Schottky barrier and facilitate charge injection.33

The differences in the WF (ΔΦ) of the two diblock CPEs modified electrodes depend on the polar nature of the side chain terminal polar ionic group. Fig. 1d shows the DFT-optimized geometries and calculated dipole moments of the diblock polymers PFEO-b-PTNBr and PFEO-b-PTImBr. The different terminal ionic groups of PFEO-b-PTNBr and PFEO-b-PTImBr exert great influence on the dipole moment. For one repeat unit, the dipole moment of PFEO-b-PTNBr is calculated to be 49.9 D, whereas its analog PFEO-b-PTImBr with imidazole salt shows a bigger dipole moment of 72.5 D. On the other hand, the larger dipole of PFEO-b-PTImBr may also be due to the contribution of the hydrogen bonds between the protons of (NH(CH3)+) with the oxygen atom of ITO.
To further evaluate the interface interaction between the CPEs and ITO, X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of pristine ITO and ITO/CPEs were measured, as shown in Fig. 2a. The high-resolution N 1s XPS spectra of the bare ITO and CPEs/ITO are shown in Fig. 2b. For bare ITO, N 1s peaks are not detected. The high-resolution XPS spectrum of ITO/PFEO-b-PTNBr clearly exhibits N 1s peaks at the binding energy of 399.9 eV, whereas two peaks at 399.5 and 401.45 eV are observed for ITO/PFEO-b-PTImBr. For the new peak at 401.45 eV, which corresponds to methylimidazole (N(CH3)+), the N atom linked to methyl is partially protonated by accepting protons (H+) dissociated from water or methanol because of its basicity after deposition on ITO.34 The In 3d XPS spectra of ITO and the diblock CPEs-modified ITO are depicted in Fig. 2c. Compared to the In 3d binding energy of ITO centered at 452.4 and 444.8 eV, both ITO/PFEO-b-PTNBr and ITO/PFEO-b-PTImBr shift toward a lower binding energy by 0.25–0.8 eV. The shifts to the lower binding energy may be associated with the higher negative charge density on indium ions due to the strong interfacial interaction. The O 1s XPS spectra in Fig. 2d include various oxygen species, which could be the result of the following: (1) oxide of ITO,35,36 (2) ethylene oxide chain for PFEO-b-PTNBr and PFEO-b-PTImBr, (3) electrostatic interaction between ethylene oxide of CPEs and hydrogen of ITO and (4) hydrogen bonding for PFEO-b-PTImBr.37,38 The peak at 531.7 eV, which corresponds to O2− ions present in pristine ITO, shifts to 530.3 and 529.95 eV when PFEO-b-PTNBr and PFEO-b-PTImBr are deposited on top of ITO, respectively. Moreover, compared to ITO/PFEO-b-PTNBr, a new peak at 531.65 eV is detected in ITO/PFEO-b-PTImBr, which is due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between the protons of the protonated (N(CH3)+) and oxygen atom of ITO (inset of Fig. 2d).

To further characterize how the different terminal ionic groups influence the polarity of the molecules, pyrene was used as a fluorescence probe in the polyelectrolytes. The polarity of conjugated polyelectrolytes directly influences the intensities of the various vibronic bands in pyrene. Generally, the intensity of the 0–0 band (band 1) is sensitive to a polar environment, whereas there is little effect on band 3.39 Therefore, the ratio of intensities I1/I3 is an effective and facile pathway to research polar environmental change. The film fluorescence spectra of the reference pyrene and 0.5 mg mL−1PFEO-b-PTNBr and PFEO-b-PTImBr doped pyrene are shown in Fig. 3, and the corresponding vibronic bands parameters are described in Table S1.† From the fluorescence probe results, the calculated I1/I3 values of pyrene and PFEO-b-PTNBr and PFEO-b-PTImBr doped pyrene are 12.8, 14.8 and 16.3, respectively. This indicates that the polarity of PFEO-b-PTImBr is stronger than that of PFEO-b-PTNBr. The stronger molecular polarity could preferentially form stronger interfacial dipoles at the electrode and active layer interface, which is consistent with the above discussed KPM, UPS and DFT-optimized geometries theory calculation.

Diblock polymers composed of two different conjugated backbone blocks are well known to spontaneously self-assemble at the nanometer scale due to the immiscibility of the blocks and/or crystallinity differences.40–42 In order to investigate the self-assembly behavior of PFEO-b-PTNBr and PFEO-b-PTImBr CPEs spin-coated on ITO substrates, atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. S8†) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. S9†) were used for characterization. With the dimensions of 5 μm × 5 μm, the surface root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the diblock polymers PFEO-b-PTNBr and PFEO-b-PTImBr are 1.26 and 1.25 nm, respectively. As shown in Fig. S4,† the surface of the PFEO-b-PTNBr film on ITO shows the occurrence of ordered micelles (Fig. S8a and b†). However, for PFEO-b-PTImBr, many typical vesicles can be clearly observed (Fig. S8c and d†). Likewise, ordered micelles and vesicles are also observed in the TEM images (Fig. S9†). Since the two polymers both have polar oxyalkyl chains and quaternary ammonium salt or imidazolium on their two side chains, all of these polar groups can cause strong intermolecular interaction with the ITO substrate. Consequently, the diblock polymers PFEO-b-PTNBr and PFEO-b-PTImBr tend to develop a preferable scolopendra shape with a face-on orientation in which the backbone is parallel to the ITO substrate (Fig. 4). To verify our assumption, the out-of-plane and in-plane grazing incidence X-ray diffractions (GIXRD) of PFEO-b-PTNBr and PFEO-b-PTImBr on ITO were investigated, as shown in Fig. 4. However, the two polymers show no reflections both at low angles and high angles of in-plane diffraction under careful testing several times, which should be ascribed to the fact that films of PFEO-b-PTNBr and PFEO-b-PTImBr are too thin to detect the diffraction signals (Fig. 4a). Delightfully, from the out-of plane shown in Fig. 4b, both PFEO-b-PTNBr and PFEO-b-PTImBr deposited on ITO display distinct (010) plane reflections and (100) plane reflections are hardly seen, which indicate that the diblock CPEs are oriented with a face-on arrangement (Fig. 4b). The face-on scolopendra-like orientations of the diblock CPEs are expected to induce the spontaneous self-assembly of the upper active layer at the nanometer scale.

(c) In-plane and (d) out-of-plane GIXRD patterns of the corresponding active layer P3HT:PC61BM films spin-coated on CPEs PFEO-b-PTNBr and PFEO-b-PTImBr electron transport layers. (e) Schematic diagram of the face-on and edge-on self-assembly of the active layer induced by the scolopendra-like face-on diblock CPEs interlayer. 
To gain deeper insight into the effect of the diblock CPEs interfacial layer on the molecular packing and real orientation of the upper active layer, the typical active layer P3HT:PC61BM was selected for investigation. GIXRD was also performed to examine P3HT:PC61BM blend layers spin-coated on ITO/CPEs. Interestingly, for the in-plane situation, strong 100 peaks indicative of a face-on structure of P3HT chains with π–π stacking planes perpendicular to the substrate are discovered in both curves (Fig. 4c). Such face-on orientation of the donor is very helpful for PSCs due to the higher charge mobility along the π–π stacking direction relative to that along the lamellar direction.43 In addition, the in-plane (010) reflection originating from the edge-on structure is also presented in Fig. 4c. Fig. 4d provides the out-of-plane GIXRD of P3HT:PC61BM films fabricated on PFEO-b-PTNBr and PFEO-b-PTImBr ETLs. Also, it is obvious that both curves show obvious the (010) plane reflection at about 2θ = 15.9°, which is a signal of a face-on orientation of P3HT backbones, as depicted in Fig. 4e. Meanwhile, the peaks at 2θ = 5.45° and 10.81° assigned to the (100) and (200) diffractions of P3HT crystallites are also detected, which manifest that the P3HT chains deposited on PFEO-b-PTNBr and PFEO-b-PTImBr are oriented with a mixed face-on and edge-on orientation. Accordingly, both interface-induced face-on and edge-on orientations of P3HT crystallites coexist in the P3HT:PC61BM blend film spin-coated on the diblock CPEs ETL substrate. The face-on orientation of P3HT is ascribed to the induced template effects originating from the inherent self-assembly of the diblock CPEs substrate. Consequently, diblock CPEs interface-induced self-assembly is an original and straightforward approach to realize modulation of the face-on orientation of the active layer. Additionally, a schematic diagram of the self-assembled scolopendra-like diblock CPEs as a template to further induce the upper active layer to acquire an ordered face-on and edge-on structure is demonstrated in Fig. 4e.
In Fig. 5a, the UV spectra of P3HT:PC61BM deposited on diblock polymers show red-shifted bands with a higher intensity than that of pristine P3HT:PC61BM. The shoulder peak at 610 nm reflects a significantly improved packing arrangement in P3HT. Fig. 5b shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the P3HT:PC61BM active layer with and without the CPEs substrate. Obviously, compared with the pristine P3HT:PC61BM film, CPEs/P3HT:PC61BM shows a much sharper (100) diffraction peak at a lower angle (2θ = 5.66°) which corresponds to the lamellar structure of P3HT. Also, the film spin-coated on PFEO-b-PTImBr is more prominent than the film on PFEO-b-PTNBr, which suggests that PFEO-b-PTImBr endows P3HT with better crystallization property.

To further study the internal morphology of the active layer, we conducted transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on P3HT:PC61BM blend films processed with and without the diblock CPEs ETL. As can be seen from Fig. 6, the light and gray regions in the images are assigned to the P3HT-rich and PC61BM-rich domains, respectively.44 In Fig. 6, due to the well self-assembled diblock CPEs as a structural template for ordering the molecular orientation of the active layer, a large amount of nanofibers and columnar structures are observed in the P3HT:PC61BM blend films deposited on PFEO-b-PTNBr and PFEO-b-PTImBr interlayers, respectively. Additionally, the atomic force microscopy images (AFM) of P3HT:PC61BM deposited on bare ITO, PFEO-b-PTNBr and PFEO-b-PTNBr are displayed in Fig. S10.† The RMS roughness of P3HT:PC61BM spin-coated on the bare ITO substrate is 15.87 nm. Delightfully, the deposition of P3HT:PC61BM on PFEO-b-PTNBr and PFEO-b-PTImBr delivers films with the smaller RMS roughness of 13.51 and 7.42 nm, respectively. Besides, the three-dimensional AFM image of ITO, PFEO-b-PTNBr and PFEO-b-PTImBr and their corresponding P3HT:PC61BM are shown in Fig. S11.† The ordered and smooth morphology of the active layer is beneficial for charge transfer and transportation.

To explore the function of the diblock CPEs as an ETL on organic solar cells, the inverted devices based on the CPEs ETL were fabricated with the structure of ITO/CPEs/P3HT:PC61BM/MoO3/Ag. The illuminated current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the inverted PSCs based on the P3HT:PC61BM active layer under AM 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 7a, and the corresponding device data are summarized in Table 2. The PSC device without CPEs exhibits a very low photovoltaic performance with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.38 V, short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 6.09 mA cm−2, fill factor (FF) of 0.33 and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of only 0.80%. Fortunately, the device efficiencies are dramatically enhanced after insertion of the diblock CPEs interface layer between the electrode and the active layer, with a PCE of 3.1% for PFEO-b-PTNBr, and 3.5% for PFEO-b-PTImBr. It should be noted that all the device parameters, including Voc, Jsc, PCE, and FF, are improved simultaneously. This enhanced device performance is derived from the improved energy alignment in the device and optimized morphologies of both the CPE interlayer and active layer. Meanwhile, the device based on the PFEO-b-PTImBr interface layer shows superior efficiency, open circuit voltage and short circuit current in contrast to PFEO-b-PTNBr, which is indicative of the superiority of the imidazolium salt. The dark J–V curves are described in Fig. 7b. The dark current densities of the PFEO-b-PTNBr and PFEO-b-PTImBr interfacial layers under reverse bias are smaller than that of bare ITO, which means that the leakage current at negative voltages was greatly inhibited by the CPEs. The dark current curve also demonstrates that the favorable interfacial dipole caused by the diblock CPEs reduces the leakage current and enhances the charge injection efficiency. The external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of the invert devices based on ITO, ITO/PFEO-b-PTNBr and ITO/PFEO-b-PTImBr were determined, as presented in Fig. 7c. Evidently, the devices based on PFEO-b-PTNBr and PFEO-b-PTImBr display better EQE values than that based on bare ITO. Also, PFEO-b-PTImBr as an ETL possesses the highest EQE value in the wavelength range of 300–650 nm among the three devices. These results are quite in agreement with the values obtained from the J–V characteristics.

Charge carrier mobility was also measured for electron-only devices and was carried out using the space charge limited current (SCLC) model according to the Mott–Gurney equations (details of the mobility measurement are shown in the ESI†).45–48 As shown in Fig. 7d, the electron mobility of the device modified with diblock CPE is enhanced by 2–3 orders of magnitude compared to that of ITO. In addition, with respect to the device based on the PFEO-b-PTNBr ETL, the electron mobility of the device treated with PFEO-b-PTImBr is enhanced from 1.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 1.9 × 10−4 V−1 s−1. We found that the enhancement of the electron mobility by the incorporation of PFEO-b-PTNBr and PFEO-b-PTImBr can be correlated not only to the ordered morphology of the interlayer and active layer, and good ohmic contact between ITO and the active layer, but also to the self-doping effect of the novel CPEs. As displayed in Fig. 3, sharp narrow peaks (peak-to-peak line width, ΔHpp, of about 3.5 G) at about 330 G are observed from electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) for both polymers. These signals imply that polarons are formed on the CPEs PFEO-b-PTNBr and PFEO-b-PTImBr conjugated backbones.49 Also, the polaron signals are more remarkable in PFEO-b-PTImBr than in PFEO-b-PTNBr, which is ascribed to the additional N atom of methylimidazole, (N(CH3))N, in the polymer PFEO-b-PTImBr.50
To further verify and testify the universality of the novel diblock conjugated polyelectrolytes ETL, inverted PSCs devices were fabricated from a blend of the low band-gap polymer PTB7-Th:PC71BM to give ITO/ZnO/CPEs/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag. Due to the fact that the work functions of PFEO-b-PTNBr (4.42 eV) and PFEO-b-PTImBr (4.32 eV) are mismatched with the HOMO energy level of PTB7-Th (5.22 eV), the CPEs deposited on ZnO as a bilayer electron transport layer are employed as a buffer layer. The photovoltaic performance curves based on the PTB7-Th:PC71BM device are displayed in Fig. 8 and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 2. Inspiringly, the best PCE of the devices was boost sharply from 8.2% for bare ZnO to 9.0% for ZnO/PFEO-b-PTNBr and 9.4% for ZnO/PFEO-b-PTImBr (as shown in Fig. 8a). Analogous to the average PCE of ZnO (8.1%), the average efficiencies of the ZnO/PFEO-b-PTNBr and ZnO/PFEO-b-PTImBr modified devices are as high as 8.9% and 9.2%, respectively. More importantly, both PCEs of ZnO/PFEO-b-PTNBr and ZnO/PFEO-b-PTImBr based PTB7-Th:PC71BM devices are superior to that of the classical published and commonly used PFN (8.42%) and PFNBr (8.38%) ETLs based devices (as shown in Table S2†).23,24 The notable efficiencies based on the ZnO/PFEO-b-PTNBr and ZnO/PFEO-b-PTImBr bilayer interface layer should be ascribed to the simultaneous enhancement of Jsc and FF. The Jsc was enhanced from 16.46 to 17.28 and 17.44 mA cm−2 and FF enhanced from 63.1% to 66.8% and 67.9% for the PFEO-b-PTNBr and PFEO-b-PTImBr based devices, respectively.

The J–V characteristics of the electron-only devices based on the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend are plotted in Fig. 8b. Compared to the device with pristine ZnO, the electron mobilities of the PFEO-b-PTNBr and PFEO-b-PTImBr-treated ZnO devices are enhanced from 1.392 × 10−3 to 4.930 × 10−3 and 5.241 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The external quantum efficiencies (EQE) are represented to further verify the device performance. As presented in Fig. 8c, the device based on PFEO-b-PTImBr exhibits the best EQE, followed by PFEO-b-PTNBr, which is completely consistent with the results obtained from the J–V characteristics. The dark J–V curves are shown in Fig. S12,† in which it is obvious that the dark current densities of the ZnO/PFEO-b-PTNBr and ZnO/PFEO-b-PTImBr interfacial layers under reverse bias are smaller than that of the bare ZnO interfacial layer.
3. Conclusions
The current research on the CPEs interlayer is limited to the interfacial dipole modulation of CPEs with different types of backbones and pendent polar groups. However, the effects of the interface layer on the morphology and arrangement of the upper active layer are still a mystery. In this work, two novel self-assembled water/alcohol soluble CPEs, PFEO-b-PTNBr and PFEO-b-PTImBr, have been synthesized for the first time and applied as an ETL for bulk-heterojunction PSCs based on P3HT:PC61BM and PTB7-Th:PC71BM. The spontaneous self-assembled diblock polymers develop an ordered scolopendra-like face-on arrangement on the ITO cathode. More significantly, the self-assembled diblock CPEs PFEO-b-PTNBr and PFEO-b-PTImBr ETLs not only provide an ohmic contact between the ITO electrode and the active layer, but also act as a template to partially induce a favorable face-on orientation of the active layer. Surprisingly, the n-type self-doping phenomenon is observed in the two CPEs based on a p-type conjugated backbone. In addition, a stronger self-doped phenomenon of PFEO-b-PTImBr is detected by EPR compared to its counterpart PFEO-b-PTNBr. As a consequence, the device performances based on P3HT:PC61BM are largely improved by the introduction of the diblock CPEs as an ETL, with the PCE of 3.1% for PFEO-b-PTNBr and 3.5% for PFEO-b-PTImBr. Notably, the inverted device based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM with ZnO/CPEs as an ETL achieves a conspicuous PCE of 9.0% for PFEO-b-PTNBr and 9.4% for PFEO-b-PTImBr. More intriguingly, both ZnO/PFEO-b-PTNBr and ZnO/PFEO-b-PTImBr based PTB7-Th:PC71BM devices exhibit superior PCEs than that of the classical published and commonly used PFN (8.42%) and PFNBr (8.38%) ETLs based devices.
The design of self-assembled diblock CPEs ETLs to realize a face-on orientation of the upper active layer is an original and promising approach for improving the photovoltaic properties of PSCs. Although the PCE of the device is not as high as the value from state-of-the-art cells, tuning the morphology of the active layer via the diblock CPEs cathode layer can provide valuable guidance for the future development of morphology and device optimization. Beyond a doubt, by optimizing the energy level of diblock CPEs, the photovoltaic performance of devices will be further enhanced. The successful realization of n-type self-doping on the p-type backbone implies that the imidazole group can play a positive role in cathode interface modification and overcoming thickness-sensitive issues in the future.
