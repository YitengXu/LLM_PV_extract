    , Accepted 19th May 2009First published on 29th June 2009AbstractA series of donor–acceptor diblock copolymers with varying molecular weight are studied in thin film and compared with an ‘equivalent’ blend formed from donor and acceptor homopolymers. Steady-state and transient spectroscopies are used to demonstrate a correlation between low molecular weight block copolymers and increased photoluminescence quenching (up to 99%) leading to higher yields of long-lived free charges. Such block copolymers are shown, by electron microscopy, to exhibit phase-segregated micrdomains whose size and periodicity are determined by their molecular weight. Photovoltaic devices made using these materials show a peak efficiency of 0.11% and correlate with our spectroscopic results, subject to a trade-off between charge generation and tranpsort/collection.
Introduction
Concerns over fossil fuel emissions and future energy supply are now motivating the development of alternative renewable energy sources. Organic solar cells based upon molecular semiconductors are attracting considerable interest for this purpose, owing to their low fabrication costs and potential for large area deposition on flexible plastic substrates.1–3 The current focus of research in the field of organic photovoltaics is split between two areas: materials selection for enhanced device efficiency and stability and process selection for large scale, high throughput fabrication. Comprehensive reviews of these topics can be found in refs. 4, 5 and 6. A typical organic solar cell is based on a nanostructured blend comprising electron-donating and electron-accepting organic semiconducting materials. The function of such a device is based upon a photoinduced charge separation reaction at the organic donor–acceptor heterojunction. Optical excitation of the donor results in the formation of excitons (coulombically bound electron–hole pairs). Efficient charge generation requires exciton diffusion to a donor–acceptor interface where exciton dissociation can occur. The nanomorpholgy of the donor–acceptor photoactive layer is thought to play a crucial role in photocurrent generation from polymer bulk heterojunction photovoltaics (OPVs).7–9 Current state-of-the-art devices of this nature have active layers of blended conjugated polymers (typically poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT)) and fullerene derivatives and reach solar-light to electricity conversion efficiencies of ∼5%10,11 and more recently, 6.7% in a tandem cell.12 Virtually all OPV devices reported to date have a heterojunction tailored by fabrication conditions, such as solvent the blend is spin-cast from,13–15 the rate of solvent evaporation after spin-casting,16 and/or post-deposition processes such as thermal annealing.9–11,17 Recent work has shown that devices formed this way are not necessarily morphologically stable,18 nor do they represent ideal structures for charge carrier transport, often with ‘un-wired’ phase-separated domains not contacting an appropriate charge collection electrode. As such, new methods are urgently required to achieve better control of nanomorphology in donor–acceptor composites for the realization of efficient organic solar cells. One approach to is to use self-organizing and supramolecular materials to control nanomorphology of the photoactive layer in organic solar cells.9,19 For example, donor–acceptor block copolymers have recently attracted attention in the field of molecular electronic devices such as OPVs,15,20–23 as they display several attractive properties, including phase-separation of p-type and n-type block components restricted to length scales commensurate with exciton diffusion lengths in these materials, and an ability to self-assemble into a range of different morphologies, one of which is hexagonally packed cylinders, which, when aligned, bear a striking resemblance to ‘optimised’ nanostructures proposed in the literature.24–26 Construction of an all-in-one molecule can also include additional components for functional enhancement such as dyes for expanding visible absorption.27,28 Recent studies have addressed the use of block copolymers in organic solar cells.15,20–22 For example, Thelakkat and co-workers have reported donor–acceptor diblock copolymers carrying perylene bisimide and triphenylamine as electron-transporting and hole-transporting groups respectively. Such polymers have been shown to exhibit bulk sample microphase-separated morphologies with domain spacings on the order of tens of nanometers, thereby rendering them desirable for OPV applications.20,29–31 More specifically, thin-section transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images from these studies show triphenylamine polymer blocks in a matrix of perylene bisimide with domain sizes of ∼0.5 µm for the blend compared to less than ∼50 nm and for the block copolymer. Devices fabricated from these materials were shown to exhibit an approximately one-order-of-magnitude improvement in short-circuit photocurrent density and overall efficiency compared to control devices fabricated employing a random blend of the corresponding homopolymers. Furthermore, the improvement in device performance was tentatively attributed to an improved charge generation process due to a higher surface area donor–acceptor heterojunction in the block copolymer relative to the blend.22 Many spectroscopic studies have recently addressed the charge separation and recombination reactions in random polymer–small molecule and polymer–polymer blend structures.32,33 To date, however, spectroscopic studies focussing on charge generation and recombination in self-assembling materials such as block copolymers remain limited. A more detailed understanding of the parameters controlling charge transfer in self-organizing systems is now needed to facilitate the rational design and synthesis of new materials required for high efficiency OPV devices. In this paper we address the dynamics of charge separation and recombination in self organizing donor–acceptor block copolymers composed of poly(triphenylamine) PvTPA and poly(perylene bisimide acrylate) PPerAcr. In particular, we investigate the influence of block copolymer molecular weight and phase-separation length scale upon the dynamics of charge separation and recombination. We show that charge-separation dynamics and yield are strongly dependent upon molecular weight, with the lowest molecular weight block copolymer resulting in the most efficient charge-separation yield. The recombination dynamics between the photogenerated charges are shown to be less strongly dependent upon block copolymer molecular weight. The present findings are discussed with relevance to the design and optimization of organic donor–acceptor solar cells.
Experimental
Materials
A number of block copolymers were synthesized as reported elsewhere.21,31 Blends were formed by 85% (wt.) of poly(perylene bisimide acrylate) (PPerAcr) with poly(vinyl triphenylamine) (PvTPA). Solutions were prepared in all cases in chloroform (all easily soluble) at a concentration of ∼1.5% by weight. Ultra-thin polymer films for spectroscopic work were spin-coated onto glass substrates, pre-coated with conducting and transparent ITO, at a spin rate of 1500 rpm for 40 s from the chloroform solutions. Before spin-coating, substrates were pre-cleaned by sonication in acetone and isopropyl alcohol for 20 min.
Photovoltaic devices were fabricated by spin-casting PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P) onto substrates as used for thin films at a spin rate of 5000 rpm for 60 s. Substrates were pre-cleaned as before and additionally cleaned by sonication in de-ionized H2O. Samples were then annealed at ∼160 °C in air before a polymer film was spin-coated at 1500 rpm for 40 s from solutions as above. Aluminium contacts were then evaporated to 100 nm thick to give devices with active area of 0.045 cm2.
Bulk samples for TEM were annealed for one hour at 210 °C, embedded into epoxy resin and microtomed. Staining was performed with vapor phase RuO4 for 10 min.
Characterization

Thin-film spectroscopy. 
Absorption and PL spectra were measured at room temperature with a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-1601) and a spectrofluorimeter (Horiba Jobin Yvon, Fluorolog-3) respectively. Transient photoluminescence data was collected by time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) (Horiba Jobin Yvon IBH Fluorocube). Excitation was at 467 nm (1 MHz repetition rate, 80 µW cm−2 average intensity and an instrument response of 250 ps full width at half maximum), while emission was detected at 630 nm, selected by grating monochromator. Transient absorption data were collected using a highly sensitive microsecond absorption systems under N2. Data was collected using an excitation wavelength of 500 nm, with pulse width 0.6 ns and pulse energy density of 60–80 µJ cm−2 at 4 Hz repetition from a dye laser (Photon Technology International Inc. GL-301) pumped by a nitrogen laser (Photon Technology International Inc. GL-3300). Samples were then probed using a quartz halogen lamp (Bentham, IL1) with a stabilized power supply (Bentham, 605). Probe light was detected by a silicon photodiode and the signal subsequently amplified and passed by electronic band-pass filters to improve signal to noise.


Solar testing. 
Current–voltage traces were obtained under AM1.5 solar spectral conditions using a ScienceTech solar simulator and solar spectral filter. Electrical measurement was conducted using a 2400 series source meter from Keithley.


Thickness and morphology. 
Thickness measurements were performed by AFM (Pacific Nanotechnology, Nano-R2) in contact mode by scanning across samples scratched with a needle. TEM was carried out using a JEOL 2000 MkII electron microscope operated at 200 kV or a Zeiss 902 at 80 kV.

Results and discussion
The chemical structure of the block copolymers studied herein are shown in Fig. 1 along with the corresponding schematic energy level diagram. A series of three block copolymers with varying molecular weights [hereafter referred to as polymer 1 (Mn ∼38 kg mol−1), polymer 2 (Mn ∼28 kg mol−1), and polymer 3 (Mn ∼9 kg mol−1)] were compared to a blend formed from 85% PPerAcr and 15% PvTPA and pristine PPerAcr homopolymer. The structures of the three polymers are shown in Fig. 1, with molecular weight, polydispersity index (PDI) and PPerAcr weight percentage for all three polymers summarized in Table 1. Thin films of the donor–acceptor block copolymers were spun-cast to thicknesses of between 150 and 200 nm. Steady-state absorption spectroscopy (see Fig. 2a) shows similar absorbance in each film due to similar numbers of absorbing species in each sample studied (since PPerAcr is the only species that absorbs in the visible in each sample); Fig. 2a shows absorption spectra from a homopolymer PPerAcr and block copolymer 1 (all spectra are similar, only two are shown for clarity). The photoluminescence spectra of all films, excited at 470 nm, is presented in Fig. 2a. Peak emission is observed at 630 nm and attributed to PPerAcr, as indicated by the PPerAcr homopolymer film. On addition of donor material, this emission is quenched by varying degrees. Block copolymer samples studied quench the emission in a trend related to their molecular weight, with the smallest polymer (3) having the largest degree of quenching; all emit less than the polymer blend film.

(b) Transient photoluminescence data comparing pristine PPerAcr (black) with polymer blend (red) and varying molecular weight block copolymers (1, 2 and 3 in blue, orange and purple, respectively). Thin films were excited at 467 nm while emission from the perylene bisimide was measured at 630 nm. The photon counting was performed for the same amount of time in each experiment. The instrument response function is shown in grey (solid line) and has a full width at half maximum of 250 ps. Traces are corrected for minor differences in optical density at the wavelength of excitation. 
Transient photoluminescence studies corroborate steady-state quenching and are shown in Fig. 2b. Under excitation at 467 nm, emission from perylene bisimide (630 nm) has a half time of 7 ± 1 ns (pristine PPerAcr) and is deemed to be fluorescence at this time scale. It can be seen that addition of donor compound leads to successively shorter fluorescence lifetimes for polymer-blend followed by block copolymers 1, 2 and 3 (blue, orange and purple). Each trace is the result of the same exposure by each sample to a fixed number of incident photons; approximately the same number of photons is absorbed by each film (minor differences in absorbance are obviated by correcting for absorbance at the excitation wavelength). By comparing the integrated areas, the yield of fluorescence relative to pristine PPerAcr is estimated, and the results are shown in Table 2.

Direct evidence for free charges in illuminated thin films of donor–acceptor material comes from observing changes in sample absorption in the red and near-infrared region of the visible spectrum. Films excited by a laser at 500 nm exhibit absorption features at 720 nm and 800 nm; one such spectrum is shown in Fig. 3. Thin films of block copolymer, optically excited at 500 nm, were probed 2 µs after excitation with light at varying wavelengths; the resultant change in absorption due to excitation is plotted and shows features we attribute to the presence of perylene bisimide anions, consistent with spectra found (by spectroelectrochemistry) in the literature.34,35 These features are not present without excitation and are not present in pristine PPerAcr films.
 Fig. 3  (a) Transient absorption data for block copolymer 2 collected 2 µs after an excitation pulse at 500 nm. Thin film samples were probed at varying wavelengths to form a transient spectrum. (b) Transient kinetic traces obtained when observing absorption due to perylene bisimide anions at 720 nm; polymer blend (red line), and block copolymers with varying molecular weights, 1, 2 and 3 (blue, orange and purple lines) excited at 500 nm. The graph inset shows transient absorption data on a log–log plot with linear fit for block copolymers 3. Samples are excited at 500 nm with energy densities of 60–80 µJ cm−2. 

Fig. 3b shows the transient of perylene bisimide anions, as observed at 720 nm, in thin films of polymer blend and block copolymers 1, 2 and 3. All samples show anion absorption with lifetimes on the order of microseconds. The amplitude of the signal (magnitude of change in optical density, ΔO.D.) in this figure is directly related to the number of anions present (Beer–Lambert law); this implies that (for time scales before 10 µs) there is a trend of increasing charge carriers present with decreasing molecular weight of block copolymer, consistent with increased exciton dissociation seen in Fig. 2. The inset in Fig. 3b shows a log–log plot of selected transient absorption traces of block copolymer 3 from the main graph; a linear fit corresponding to a single power-law (ΔOD ∼ t−α) is indicative of a single decay mechanism with competing recombination versustransport dynamics.36 We find that all traces shown in Fig. 3 exhibit power-law decays with a single exponent in the range α = 0.3–0.5, although only data and fit for block copolymer 3 is presented for clarity. The exponent taken from the inset graph, gives α = 0.49 for polymer 3, suggesting the presence of thermal traps limiting the diffusion of charges, as has been reported in MDMO-PPV:PCBM (α = 0.3–0.4)32 and P3HT:PCBM (α = 0.3–0.7)9,33 blends.

Transmission electron microscopy was employed to determine the nanomorphology of the block copolymer samples. Microscopy images in Fig. 4 show phase separation in bulk samples (5–6 µm thick) of block copolymer; dark regions denote perylene bisimide stained by RuO4 and show ∼25 nm wire-like domains in polymer 1 (Fig. 4a) and ∼12 nm wire-like domains in polymer 2 (Fig. 4b). Polymer 3 does not show discernible phase separation (Fig. 4c), this being most likely due to a low degree of polymerisation in this polymer that may reduce the order disorder transition (ODT) to below room temperature, leaving the polymer in a disordered state where chains are intermixed. Fig. 4d shows the TEM image of a thin film composed of random blend of the two homopolymers PPerAcr and PvTPA. It is apparent that the phase separation of the donor–acceptor domains is in region of ∼100–500 nm, considerably larger than the three block copolymer samples. We note that morphology in thin films may be different to that exhibited in bulk samples due to free-surface/substrate wetting effects and confinement effects. Different morphological structures may have different interfacial surface areas, however, interfacial separation (in at least one dimension) is limited by the physical length of each block in the copolymer. As such, microscopy images of bulk samples are still instructive for showing microphase-separated length scales.

In a sample of non-conjugated block copolymer (coil–coil type), equilibrium morphology is generally determined by three factors: degree of polymerization (N), relative volume fraction (for a copolymer with A and B type monomers this would be fA = 1 − fB) and an enthalpic interaction parameter (χ) measuring the energetic penalty for contact between two dissimilar monomers. Both of the former variables are controlled through chemical synthesis whereas the latter is dependent on the choice of monomers making up the chain. Conjugated diblock copolymers by contrast are often rod–coil or rod–rod type, and the stiffness of one or both chain components leads to additional interactions that alter the range and variety of possible microphase structures.37,38 The polymers with conjugated pendants under investigation in this article form a separate class to standard conjugated and non-conjugated block copolymers. A flexible backbone should allow for coil–coil type interactions of traditional polymers, however π–π interactions have led to the observation of strong crystallisation in at least one block component (PPerAcr).31 It is therefore necessary to rely on empirical techniques to probe segregated microdomain morphology in these polymers. However, from the chemical structure of these polymers it is possible to draw the following conclusions: block copolymers 1, 2, and 3 have similar block volume fractions and are composed of the same two monomer units. They differ significantly only in their degree of polymerization. This difference gives rise to differing size and periodicity of phase-separated domain spacings, or in the case of polymer 3, a disordered state. Polymer 2 has a smaller degree of polymerization (corresponding to lower molecular weight) than 1 and has a shorter bulk sample inter-domain spacing, as seen in Fig. 4. Smaller domains imply that on average, photoinduced excited states are generated closer to an interface where they are dissociated. This is evidenced by a correlation between higher degree of photoluminescence quenching (as illustrated in Table 1) and decreasing N in the block copolymer series, and also an inverse correlation between yield of free charge carriers and decreasing N in the block copolymer series, seen in Figs. 2 and 3. Comparing a block copolymer sample with a corresponding weight-for-weight homopolymer blend, the above correlations are maintained when considering domain sizes and inter-domain spacing. In general, polymer blends will phase segregate to minimise component interfacial surface area; this gives rise to large domains compared to a block copolymer, in which phase segregation is constrained.20 These large domains with low surface area to volume ratio are seen to give poor photoluminescence quenching and poorer free charge carrier yields than the block copolymer samples studied here.
It is apparent from Fig. 3b that the charge recombination kinetics are less sensitive to modulation in molecular weight of the block copolymer than luminescence lifetime. However, it is interesting to note that the charge recombination dynamics for block copolymer 1 appear retarded, relative to polymers 2 and 3 (compare Fig. 3b plot (i) with Fig. 3b plot (ii)). It is possible that the larger phase-separated domains exhibited in block copolymer 1 relative to polymers 2 and 3 serve to move the photogenerated electrons and holes further apart after exciton dissociation (increasing spatial separation of electron and hole), thereby leading to a longer recombination lifetime. This assertion is supported by recent experimental and theoretical studies of charge transport and recombination in polymer blends where larger phase-segregated domains were shown to reduce charge recombination and favour charge carrier transport.39 Further, more detailed studies addressing the effect of energetic and interface structure block copolymers upon charge-separated state lifetime are currently underway and will be reported in our future work.
Photovoltaic devices were fabricated from the materials studied using a standard architecture, glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Al. Current–voltage traces illuminated under AM1.5 simulated solar irradiation can be seen in Fig. 5, and key characteristics of these devices are presented in Table 3. The most efficient device was made from Polymer 2 (orange line), giving an average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.075% and a maximum of 0.11%. The blend device (red line) shows an improved fill factor of 0.39 but with poor open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current contributing to a lower PCE of 0.014%. Polymer 1 (blue line) and polymer 3 (purple line) by contrast have poor fill factors with higher open-circuit voltage. Polymer 3 exhibits the poorest performance due to a low fill factor and very small short-circuit current, leading to a PCE of just 0.004%. This very small efficiency does not follow the trend of increasing open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current and PCE with decreasing molecular weight set by polymers 1 and 2. Indeed, the performance of a polymer 3 device is significantly worse than that of one made using the blend. The relatively poor device performance of polymer 3 (compared to polymers 1 and 2) can be rationalized by considering the lack of phase separation as is seen in Fig. 4c. Transport in such a homogenous blend will be poor, as will contact selectivity at the aluminium electrode.

Table 3 shows a trend of increasing open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current and power conversion efficiency with decreasing domain size that correlates with our spectroscopic observations, but is broken by polymer 3. This suggests that a balance exists between domain sizes that encourage charge generation and those that aid transport and collection.
Conclusion
We have shown evidence that by using block copolymers as opposed to random blends, desirable interfacial phase separation can be achieved and controlled at the materials synthesis stage (degree of polymerization). A low molecular weight block copolymer studied herein (polymer 3) shows photoluminescence quenching of 99% compared to a control chromophore and 62% compared to an equivalent weight ratio random blend. This is attributed to the immediate proximity of excited states (excitons) to interfacial boundaries in block copolymers which also results in observable quantities of long-lived (order of µs) charge-separated states in block copolymers and significantly fewer in a blend film. The present findings demonstrate that donor–acceptor block copolymers can be used to control both the nanomorphology and charge-separation efficiency in organic solar cells. Finally, we use block copolymers to make OPVs with PCE of 0.11% that outperform a similar blend by a factor of four, but that are based on a degree of polymerization that constitutes a compromise between charge generation and transport/collection.

 	Fig. 1  Chemical structure of the polymers studied herein. Shown also shown is a schematic energy level diagram in which the donor and acceptor electron affinity and ionization potential are given in eV.	 


Block copolymer 1	PvTPA-b-PPerAcr	40000	1.97	79

Block copolymer 2	PvTPA-b-PPerAcr	27800	1.47	94

Block copolymer 3	PvTPA-b-PPerAcr	9200	1.43	73

 	Fig. 2  (a) Steady-state absorption spectrum of homopolymer PPerAcr film (solid black line) and block copolymer 1 (dotted blue line), and photoluminescence spectra of homopolymer PPerAcr (solid black line), polymer blend (dashed red line) and block copolymers 1 (dotted blue line), 2 (dotted orange line) and 3 (dotted purple line) excited at 470 nm. (b) Transient photoluminescence data comparing pristine PPerAcr (black) with polymer blend (red) and varying molecular weight block copolymers (1, 2 and 3 in blue, orange and purple, respectively). Thin films were excited at 467 nm while emission from the perylene bisimide was measured at 630 nm. The photon counting was performed for the same amount of time in each experiment. The instrument response function is shown in grey (solid line) and has a full width at half maximum of 250 ps. Traces are corrected for minor differences in optical density at the wavelength of excitation.

Block copolymer 3	0.01

 	Fig. 3  (a) Transient absorption data for block copolymer 2 collected 2 µs after an excitation pulse at 500 nm. Thin film samples were probed at varying wavelengths to form a transient spectrum. (b) Transient kinetic traces obtained when observing absorption due to perylene bisimide anions at 720 nm; polymer blend (red line), and block copolymers with varying molecular weights, 1, 2 and 3 (blue, orange and purple lines) excited at 500 nm. The graph inset shows transient absorption data on a log–log plot with linear fit for block copolymers 3. Samples are excited at 500 nm with energy densities of 60–80 µJ cm−2.	 

 	Fig. 4  
          TEM images of samples preferentially stained with RuO4 to make PPerAcr domains appear dark. (a, b, c) Thin sections cut from bulk samples of polymer 1, 2, and 3 respectively. Polymer 1 and 2 show nano-wires of perylene bisimide with diameter ∼25 nm and ∼10 nm respectively in a matrix of poly (vinyltriphenylamine). Polymer 3 exhibits no discernible phase segregation. (d) Top-down image of a thin film made from a blend of PPerAcr and PvTPA with large domains of order 100–500 nm.
