    , Accepted 20th October 2020First published on 21st October 2020AbstractGeTe as one of the most promising medium temperature thermoelectrics has progressed leaps and bounds in recent years, largely thanks to a combination of its unique electronic, thermal and structural properties. Despite its various advantages, a major factor standing in the way of wide commercial adoptions lies in its unreliable mechanical properties. This work reports Re doping as a strategy to drastically enhance the mechanical properties of GeTe, resulting in Vickers microhardness as high as 342.6 Hv in Ge0.88Sb0.10Re0.02Te, which is more than double that of pristine GeTe (145 Hv). Ge0.88Sb0.10Re0.02Te also exhibited a Young's modulus of 64.1 GPa, substantially higher than many other binary chalcogenide thermoelectrics. The significant enhancement of GeTe in mechanical properties is mainly related to the mechanism of precipitation hardening. In addition, we found that while the electronic properties were slightly compromised with Re doping, the lattice thermal conductivity was reduced due to point defects scattering brought about by Re atoms. Therefore, a high zT value (>1.6) at 600–800 K is achieved in Ge0.88Sb0.10Re0.02Te. Furthermore, above 10% device efficiency can be expected for the operating temperature between 300–800 K. Such a solution to strengthen the mechanical properties of GeTe using Re doping is expected to play a major part in the push for full-scale GeTe-based thermoelectric devices.
1. Introduction
In order for thermoelectric materials to be commercially viable for energy harvesting or cooling devices, decades of efforts have been dedicated to improving the dimensionless figure of merit zT = S2σT/(κL + κe), where S, σ, T, κL and κe are the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, absolute temperature, and lattice and electronic contributions to the total thermal conductivity, respectively. The parameters S, σ, κL and κe that make up zT are often inter-dependent. For example, S and σ are inversely correlated with the carrier concentration (n). Likewise, σ is proportional to κe, which limits the role of each of these parameters in enhancing the zT. Through decades of advances in fundamental physical understanding of thermoelectrics, a few strategies have emerged to independently enhance the thermoelectric performances.1–3 For instance, band convergence, resonant doping and energy filtering can be used to individualistically enhance the Seebeck coefficient while effective mass and carrier scattering engineering are used to independently increase the electrical conductivity.4–13 Moreover, strategies such as point defects, nanocomposites, strain engineering, dislocations, and stacking faults are prevalent in reducing the lattice thermal conductivity.14–22
Compared to most other thermoelectrics, GeTe has an additional degree of freedom in its structural phase transition at ∼700 K.23 Below this temperature, GeTe has a rhombohedral structure, in which the valence band maximum is dominated by the Σ-band, followed closely by the L-band. Above the phase transition temperature in the cubic phase, these two bands are swapped, i.e., the L-band becomes the valence band maximum, just like in the case of its cubic PbTe and SnTe counterparts. This unique feature of GeTe enables easy tuning to achieve the band convergence via doping/alloying. Not surprisingly, most of the studies on GeTe so far have focused on optimizing the carrier concentration via counter-doping using a cation of higher valence (i.e., Sb or Bi).24–35 Nevertheless, not all dopants with a higher valence are effective to tune the carrier concentration.36–38 Besides, other strategies to improve its power factor (S2σ) via resonant doping or lone-pair manipulation have been reported.39–44 In addition, studies on suppressing the phase transition to achieve cubic GeTe by alloying with Sn, Mn or Ti have been reported.45–48 It is worth mentioning that due to its tendency to form Ge-vacancies, GeTe has been a predominantly p-type material.49–51 The only n-type GeTe so far was achieved via heavy alloying with AgBiSe2.52 The combination of these strategies has enabled zT and a quality factor as high as 2.4 and 1.3, respectively.53,54 Furthermore, a record power conversion efficiency as high as 16% over a temperature difference of 400 K was recently reported.55 This is the highest among all thermoelectric materials used for power generation applications such as silicides, PbTe, and Half-Heusler.56–59 However, for practical device applications, the mechanical properties such as hardness, Young's modulus, and even coefficient of thermal expansion are important parameters that cannot be overlooked.60–66
In this work, we report on a drastic improvement in the mechanical properties of GeTe via rhenium (Re) doping. By introducing 2% of Re, Vickers microhardness as high as 342.6 Hv was achieved, which is more than twice the value of pristine GeTe of around 145 Hv. This also represents the highest value amongst binary chalcogenides. Additionally, a Young's modulus as high as 64.1 GPa was observed in the same sample, which is also higher than those of many other thermoelectric materials.39 In other words, our strategy made big progress in solving the pervasive problem of the inferior mechanical properties of GeTe. Furthermore, negligible deterioration in thermoelectric performances was observed, when co-doping with Sb to improve its thermoelectric performances. For instance, Ge0.88Sb0.10Re0.02Te achieved a zT of >1.6 at 760 K. We further showed that while the introduction of Re degrades the mobility and hence the power factor, it also reduces the lattice thermal conductivity via mass and size fluctuation, and thus results in a similar overall thermoelectric zT. We envisaged that this approach to reinforce mechanical properties by doping Re element would be applied to a wide range of other thermoelectric materials to improve their mechanical properties.
2. Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for GeTe and doped GeTe samples. XRD peaks at around 25°, 26°, 42° and 43.5°, corresponding to the signature peaks of rhombohedral GeTe, can be observed in all samples. In addition, very small diffraction peaks at 2θ of 28° and 45° belonging to elemental Ge were observed for all samples and are marked with an asterisk in Fig. 1a, which is consistent with the well-known tendency of GeTe to form Ge agglomerates throughout the samples.47–49Fig. 1(b) shows the SEM EDX mapping of Ge0.98Re0.02Te, showing that Ge precipitates are prevalent in GeTe-based compounds. It is noteworthy from the same figure that Re does not dope well into the Ge sites, as confirmed by Fig. 1(c) which shows a Re-rich region. Furthermore, the XPS spectra of Re 4f are shown in Fig. 1(d). The peak centred at a binding energy of 40.30 eV corresponds to the Re metal. The peaks at binding energies of 41.78 and 44.27 correspond to the Re native oxides, RexOy and ReO3, correspondingly. The peak at a binding energy of 45.81 eV corresponds to ReO2. All peaks in the XPS spectra are indexed based on the NIST database.67 Evidently, the XPS analysis shows that the Re dopant is not in the 2+ state, and therefore unlikely to have been doped into the Ge sites.

To examine the effect of Re doping on the mechanical properties of GeTe, nano-indentation was conducted on all doped samples, as shown in Fig. 2(a) in the load vs. displacement profile with the corresponding Vickers microhardness and Young's modulus summarized in Table 1. The load vs. displacement profile is illustrated in Fig. 2(a). Vickers microhardness and Young's modulus data of Re-doped GeTe are summarized in Table 1. Fig. 2(b) shows the comparison of the shape of Ge0.98Re0.02Te and GeTe samples after polishing. Contrary to the typical behaviour of pristine GeTe which is known to be very brittle,54,68 the Re doped sample is not easy to break. Ge0.88Sb0.10Re0.02Te exhibits superior Young's modulus and Vickers hardness to many other thermoelectric materials. The large enhancement in mechanical properties can be associated with the secondary phase strengthening/precipitation hardening, which is a well-known strengthening mechanism for metallic/metalloid materials. The Re phase impedes the dislocation movements in the GeTe matrix, which results in remarkable increase in hardness. Illustration of the precipitation hardening mechanism is illustrated in Fig. S5 (ESI†).

The electrical properties of pristine GeTe as well as Re and Sb-doped GeTe are summarized in Fig. 3. Fig. 3(a) shows the Seebeck coefficient of all samples vs. the temperature. Compared with pristine GeTe, doping of 2% Re does not change the Seebeck coefficient appreciably. Similarly, the doping of 2% Re to Ge0.9Sb0.1Te results in similar Seebeck coefficients to that of Ge0.9Sb0.1Te. Thus, it can be inferred that Re does not efficiently modulate the carrier concentration in GeTe, as evident from Hall carrier concentration (Table S1, ESI†). Likewise, the electrical conductivity does not show substantial difference upon Re doping (Fig. 3b). It is noteworthy that the slight decrease in the electrical conductivity can be associated with the lowered carrier mobility arising from point defects scattering upon Re introduction. The slight decrease to the Hall mobility upon the introduction of Re is corroborated by the trend of the weighted-mobility, which is a carrier concentration independent parameter to quantify intrinsic mobility, as shown in Fig. 3(c). The versatility and holistic nature of weighted-mobility in quantifying the electronic transport quality were discussed in detail in the recent paper by Snyder, et al.79 Interestingly, the weighted mobility for pristine GeTe is the highest amongst all samples at room temperature. This can be understood from the carrier scattering upon the introduction of point defects, which reduces the intrinsic mobility. However, Sb-doped samples Ge0.90Sb0.10Te and Ge0.88Sb0.10Re0.02Te exhibit marginally higher weighted mobility than GeTe without Sb doping when the temperature is more than 600 °C. This can be ascribed to the increased band-degeneracy between the Σ-band and the L-band due to the crystal structure distortion brought about by the introduction of Sb, which increases the interaxial angle towards 90° (cubic).51 Furthermore, the introduction of Sb doping serves to decrease the carrier concentration in GeTe to a more optimal level, as evidenced by the substantially higher power factor in both Ge0.90Sb0.10Te and Ge0.88Sb0.10Re0.02Te than Ge0.98Re0.02Te (Fig. 3d).

In fact, the manifestation of the increase in the band-degeneracy upon the introduction of Sb doping is evidently clear in the Pisarenko analysis in Fig. 4(a). For pristine GeTe (dashed black lines), the S vs. n can be fitted to mDOS* = 1.15 (density of states effective mass), which can be used to quantify the degree of the band degeneracy. Remarkably, upon doping with Sb (dashed blue line), the mDOS* increases drastically to 2.10, which is consistent with the argument in Fig. 3(c) on increasing the band degeneracy.

In addition to carrier concentration optimization, in order to further understand the effect of Sb doping and Re doping on the thermoelectric properties, it is helpful to analyze the relation between Seebeck and electrical conductivity via the Jonker analysis. Unlike the Pisarenko analysis, this analysis does not require information on the data of carrier concentration, which may be inaccurate or hard to be determined for samples with a very low carrier mobility.80Fig. 4(b) shows the Jonker plot (details in the ESI†) in the acoustic phonon scattering limited regime for all samples at 300 K. The blue and red dashed lines represent an intrinsic transport coefficient σE0 of 400 and 800 S cm−1, respectively. As expected, the pristine GeTe shows the highest intrinsic transport coefficient, which is consistent with the weighted-mobility in Fig. 3(c). However, at 760 K (Fig. 4(c) and (d)), the Sb-doped samples have higher values of σE0 (1400 S cm−1), which is due to the higher effective mass (Fig. 4(a)). It is worth noting that at about 600 K, the σE0 for Sb-doped samples increases abruptly, which is consistent with the transition from rhombohedral to cubic phase, consequently resulting in the band-convergence between the Σ-band and the L-band.
The results of thermal transport analysis are shown in Fig. 5. Unsurprisingly, the total thermal conductivity of Re- and Sb-doped samples is lower than that of the pristine GeTe. The reduction in total thermal conductivity in these samples can be ascribed to two main origins: a lower electrical conductivity due to a lowered carrier concentration and a lower lattice thermal conductivity. For Sb-doped GeTe (Ge0.9Sb0.1Te and Ge0.88Sb0.10Re0.02Te), the main reduction in thermal conductivity originates from a reduction in electrical conductivity, thus lowering the electronic thermal conductivity (Fig. S2, ESI†). In contrast, the main contribution to the reduced thermal conductivity of Ge0.98Re0.02Te stems from the reduced lattice thermal conductivity (Fig. 5b). The dashed lines in the figure represent the Debye–Callaway modelled lattice thermal conductivity in this material. The black dashed line takes into account only the phonon–phonon scattering (Umklapp) contribution, while the red and blue dashed lines, which coincide with each other, represent the contribution from point defects and grain boundaries phonon scattering. Evidently, the main contribution to the reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity originates from point defects, as corroborated by the spectral thermal conductivity in Fig. 5(c). Due to the much heavier Re (186 g mol−1) atoms compared to Ge (72.6 g mol−1), the introduction of Re into GeTe reduced the spectral thermal conductivity drastically, especially in the high-frequency regime shown in Fig. 5(c). Last but not least, zT as high as 1.7 is achieved at 773 K in both Ge0.9Sb0.1Te and Ge0.88Sb0.10Re0.02Te, as shown in Fig. 5(d).

The performances of a single leg thermoelectric device were determined and the results are summarized in Fig. 6. The single leg device has a dimension of 2 mm × 2 mm × 8 mm. For all experiments, the cold end of the device was kept at room temperature (300 K). Fig. 6(a) shows the output current vs. voltage as a function of various temperature gradients. At a ΔT of 50 K, the output voltage as high as 2.5 mV and the output current as high as 0.6 mA were observed. The maximum output power of more than 0.45 μW, equivalent to an output power density of slightly above 11 μW cm−2, was obtained in the impedance matched condition of around 3 Ω, as shown in Fig. 6(b). Such a power output is sufficient to power remote wireless sensors and handheld electronic devices.81

In addition, under a higher temperature gradient, the output power is expected to increase substantially because of the better medium temperature performance of the GeTe in this study, (Fig. 6(c)), which is using a 2 cm × 2 cm device geometry. Under impedance matching conditions, a power of 3 W can be obtained at a reasonable temperature gradient of 500 K (corresponding to the hot end of around 500 °C, which can be found in many chemical and petrochemical processes).82Fig. 6(d) shows a conversion efficiency of above 10% using this material, which is comparable to other means of energy harvesting technologies such as some commercial solar cells.83
3. Conclusions
In summary, in order to address the key factor that hinders applications of GeTe TE materials, this work demonstrates an effective strategy to considerably enhance the mechanical properties of GeTe. By adding 2% Re into GeTe, the Vickers microhardness was enhanced by more than double from 145 Hv to 342.6 Hv and meanwhile the Young's modulus was increased by 16.5% more than that of pristine GeTe, which was also higher than that of many other binary chalcogenides. The precipitation hardening is responsible for the improvement of mechanical properties of GeTe with Re doping. In addition, detailed analysis of electronic and thermal transport properties revealed that the doping of Re resulted in an overall comparable thermoelectric performance with a zT value of >1.6 to these reported GeTe. Furthermore, a single-leg TE device was fabricated and showed a decent power output of 11 μW cm−2 at a temperature gradient of 50 K. Besides, our device also proved that the conversion efficiency of 10% at a moderate temperature gradient of 500 K can be achieved. We envisaged that doping of Re to strengthen the mechanical properties would be an encouraging approach to a wide range of other thermoelectric materials and therefore represents a big step forward towards practical thermoelectric power generation.
4. Experimental section
4.1. Synthesis
Polycrystalline pellets of GeTe were prepared via mixing a stoichiometric amount of high-purity element (99.99%) followed by loading the mixture into a quartz ampoule at a high vacuum of 10−5 mbar. It was observed that GeTe upon the spark plasma sintering (SPS) process tended to be brittle after 5% Re was introduced to the mixture. Therefore, the molar percentage of Re in the mixture was controlled to be at a low level (2%). The mixtures were melted at 1223 K for 12 hours before quenching in ice water. Subsequently, the resulting solids were annealed at 850 K for 72 hours. The annealed ingots were then broken into small pieces and hand-ground into powder and consolidated using SPS at 800 K for 5 minutes under a pressure of 45 MPa and 1 Pa vacuum. Finally, the SPS pellet was cooled down to room temperature at a slow cooling rate of 15 K min−1 to avoid any possible cracking of the pellet. The pellets density was tested using the Archimedes method (∼98% theoretical density). The final rectangular bars were cut from pellets and polished before thermoelectric testing.
4.2. Characterization
Powder XRD patterns were obtained using a Bruker D8-Advance X-ray powder diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The high temperature Seebeck coefficient and electrical resistivity were measured using ZEM-3 from ULVAC. High temperature thermal conductivity was measured from LFA 457 Netzsch. Microscopy analysis was done in field emission scanning electron microscopy FESEM (JEOL JSM 7600F). A Thermo Scientific Theta Probe XPS equipped with a monochromatic Al-Kα X-ray (E = 1486.7 eV) source was used for spectra acquisition. The XRF data were collected using M4 Tornado Micro X-ray Fluorescence. Sound velocity measurement was conducted in the longitudinal mode using ultrasonic equipment (iThera Medical GmbH). The mechanical properties (Young's Modulus and hardness) were investigated using a nanoindentation system (Agilent G200 Nanoindenter XP) with a diamond Berkovich tip. For each sample, the experiment was repeated more than 5 times and an average of the obtained measurements was taken. Prior to indentation, all samples were polished using diamond paste 1/10 micron from Kemet. The thermoelectric device performance simulation was performed using a simulator from NanoHUB.84 The crystal structure visualization was prepared using VESTA.85 Scanning Electron Microscopy/Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM/EDX) was performed using a JEOL JSM-5800LV to provide mapping of elemental composition.
