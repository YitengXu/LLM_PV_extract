However, current IPCs suffer from incompatibility problems, device packing, serious carrier recombination, and long-range electron transmission path, which lead to low conversion efficiency and cycling performance. To address these issues, we propose a three-electrode quasi-solid-state IPC based on a charge-separated transition mechanism of PEDOT/RGO compatible electrode and BMIMBF4 ion gel electrolyte to accelerate carrier migration. The overall conversion efficiency of this IPC reached 5.8% and the energy storage efficiency could be maintained at 84.57%. Besides that, this bendable free-standing electrode can be applied in flexible and high-voltage IPCs as a reliable off-grid systems to supply next-generation electronics.
Introduction
To relieve energy stress, solar energy represents a mainstream resource capable of ensuring the production of energy without generating considerable environmental impact.1,2 However, the intermittent illumination of solar energy fails to meet the power demand in daily life. As a remedy, combining solar cells and energy storage devices (e.g., capacitors and batteries) to build an off-grid solar system is a new strategy that can store the electrons generated from solar irradiation and release the electricity to external loads whenever needed.3,4 To adapt to the unstable current output caused by light fluctuation, among various energy storage devices, a capacitor is a desirable tool for off-grid solar systems due to its rapid response to current change and long lifetime.5–7 In 2004, Tsutomu Miyasaka et al. first proposed a two-electrode light-driven self-charging capacitor as an efficient solar energy storage device, named integrated photocapacitor (IPC).8 Due to the high internal resistance and a schottky barrier existed in the photoelectrode of two electrode systems, resulting in a slow discharging process and poor cycle performance. In order to achieve an efficient redox reaction, a bifunctional electrode is incorporated between the photoelectrode and charge storage electrode, this three-electrode system can reduce the internal resistance to about 330 Ω.9,10 Besides, the redox electrolyte for photoconversion and a non-redox electrolyte for the energy storage device can be adopted simultaneously. Meanwhile, to solve the serious recombination of the photogenerated carriers of semiconductors in IPCs, the optimization of the compatible material becomes the focus of the study.11
The desirable compatible electrodes should have high conductivity, efficient catalytic activity, fast carrier migration, and a large specific surface area to fulfill the performance of IPC. It is also necessary to play the role of transmitting electrons in the IPC without interfering with the normal operation of the two components. Yang et al. built a self-charging IPC composed of FTO conductive glass as the shared electrode.12 The IPCs could charge to 0.68 V within 20 seconds and the overall conversion efficiencies could reach 2.13%. Although FTO and ITO can be applied as common electrodes via surface modification, which is mainly applied in left-right planar IPC, the long electron transfer distance of the planar structure may lead to low conversion efficiency.13 Compared with FTO, metal materials, such as titanium, silver, and stainless-steel mesh with excellent double-side conductivity, are also suitable as compatible electrodes for sandwich-type IPCs.14,15 Yu et al. developed an “all in one” mesh-type IPC via a shared double-sided mesh electrode coated with Cu2S film and carbon nanoparticles.16 The IPC can be charged to 0.16 V in 20 seconds and discharged for 100 seconds at 20 mA cm−2. Due to the poor energy storage property of the metal material, the compatible electrode is always prepared by growing on both sides of the metal and causing assemble complexity. Recently, conductive polymers and carbon materials with versatile allotropes are developed as flexible compatible electrodes.17,18 Liu et al. integrated a photo-capacitor via a CNT bridge, the voltage of IPC reached 0.7 V in 100 seconds and the overall energy conversion efficiency was 0.77%.19 In general, although there is a growing number of research studies on IPCs, constraints still exist such as electrolyte leakage and incompatibility.15,20,21 Whereas, due to the volatilization of the organic solvent and leakage of liquid-state electrolyte, the stability of IPCs greatly deteriorates. To solve this problem, the left-right type IPC has become a strategy to avoid electrolyte penetration,22–24 but the long distance of electrons in this integration mode is averse to the overall conversion efficiency. Considering that, we designed a top-down type IPC with gel electrolyte to assemble quasi-solid-state IPC, which has the potential to highly efficiently integrate devices for electric conversion and storage.
As mentioned above, poly (3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene)-poly (styrene sulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) as an emerging conductive polymer is available to IPCs.25 But the commercial PEDOT:PSS solution with the addition of insulation PSS dopant severely damages the conductivity, so it is not suitable as the electrode material of capacitors. To modulate the conductivity of PEDOT, positive or negative charges are introduced to increase the charge density of the PEDOT film by changing dopants and surrounding media, such as neutral hybrid, polar organic solvents, ionic salts, and acids.26,27 Except for chemical means, the electrical property of PEDOT can be reinforced with conductive materials via physical methods. Among them, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) as a two-dimensional material possesses a huge specific surface area, fast electron mobility, and excellent mechanical flexibility and has been proven to be an excellent supercapacitor electrode material.28,29 In addition, the hydrophobic interactions and π–π stacking between the functional groups in graphene can assemble with the π–π interaction between conjugated PEDOT chains. Hence, PEDOT and RGO can be co-assembled to produce PEDOT/RGO film to attain higher conductivity and activity.30,31
In this work, a quasi-solid-state IPC consisting of dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode, electro-spun PVDF membrane with I− electrolyte, free-standing PEDOT/RGO compatible electrodes, and BMIMBF4 ion gel electrolyte are shown in Fig. 1a. The PEDOT/RGO film is prepared by a simple co-assembly strategy. The conductivity and specific capacity of PEDOT-based compatible electrodes are optimized via acid treatment to enhance the conjugation length of PEDOT chains and decrease the ratio of insulative PSS. Besides, the BMIMBF4 ionic gel electrolyte has supramolecular ordering and affinity with conducting polymers, which is a contribution to accelerating electronic transmission. Under this cooperative mechanism, the IPC reaches an ultra-high overall conversion efficiency of 5.8%, and the highest energy storage efficiency recorded in this work can reach 84.57%. The flexible PEDOT/RGO film can also be applied in bendable and high-voltage integrated photo-rechargeable energy storage systems.

Characterization
The microscopic structures of the samples were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, ZEISS Gemini 300, Germany). The morphologies and roughness of the films were measured using an atomic force microscope (AFM, Bruker Dimension Icon, Germany). The chemical components were analyzed by X-ray diffraction spectrometry (XRD, Rigaku, D/MAX-2500). The infrared spectrum was measured using a Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR, thermos Scientific, Nicolet iS50) spectrometer at a scanning range from 4000 to 400 cm−1. Raman spectras were measured at room temperature under the excitation of a 532 nm-wavelength laser using a Jobin Yvon LabRAM HR 800 UV micro-Raman spectrometer. The electrical properties of the sample were analyzed by Hall Effect measurements in the van der Pauw configuration. The cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) were tested on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, Shanghai, China) in dark or light. The light power source was the CEL-PE300L-3A system (China Education Au-light Co., Ltd, Beijing, China).
Preparation of TiO2 photoanode
The TiO2 paste was prepared by mixing ethyl-cellulose (0.4 g), α-terpinol (3.2 g), and P25 (0.8 g) in ethanol (8.5 mL), followed by stirring. Next, the FTO was ultrasonically cleaned in sequence with ethanol, acetone, and deionized water. Finally, the TiO2 photoanode was prepared by spin-coating of the as-prepared paste on the FTO glasses, followed by drying and sintering at 450 °C. Then, the photoanode was soaked in N719 solution for 24 hours.
Preparation of PEDOT film (PF) and acid-treatment PEDOT film (APF) compatible electrode
PEDOT:PSS solution (5 mL, 1 mg mL−1) was slowly added into 1 M H2SO4 solution to obtain PEDOT:PSS plates. PEDOT plates were washed with deionized water, collected, and stirred for 24 hours. The diluted slurry solution was subjected to vacuum filtration, overnight drying, and soaked in acetone to remove the cellulose membrane to obtain a complete PEDOT film (PF). Finally, to achieve a high conductivity electrode, the obtained film was immersed in H2SO4 for 24 hours, dried overnight, and rinsed with plenty of deionized water. The resultant film was denoted as acid-treated PEDOT film (APF).
Preparation of acid-treated PEDOT/RGO film (APGF) compatible electrode
An aqueous dispersion of graphene oxide (GO) (5 mg mL−1) was prepared using a modified Hummers’ method. The RGO hydrogel was acquired via hydrothermal at 180 °C for 12 hours. The RGO hydrogel was freeze-dried and ground to obtain RGO powder. Next, RGO powder was obtained by grinding and ultrasound. RGO powder (20 mg) was added to the PEDOT solution and sonicated. The mixed solution was vacuum filtered to obtain a membrane, and APGF was collected, followed by soaking in acetone for stripping and treatment in concentrated sulfuric acid overnight.
Construction and measurement of quasi-solid photovoltaic cells
The quasi-solid photovoltaic device was assembled using the TiO2 photoanode (0.5 cm × 0.5 cm), PF, APF, or APGF (1 cm × 1.5 cm) as the counter electrode, and PVDF nanofiber membrane immersed I−/I3− (1.5 cm × 1.5 cm) as the spacer and electrolyte. PVDF was homogenously dispersed in acetone (10 wt%) and the resulting polymer solution was electro-spun to obtain a nanofiber membrane. The spinning voltage was 15 kV, the advancing speed was 0.5 mL h−1 and the distance between the needle and collector was 15 cm. The prepared PVDF membrane was immersed in a commercial Et23 electrolyte for 30 min to ensure the full infiltration of the electrolyte. The excess solution on the membrane was carefully wiped off with filter paper to obtain quasi-solid-state composite electrolytes (PVDF/Et23). The active area of the solar cell was 0.25 cm2. The current density (J)–voltage (V) curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra of the assembled devices were tested on an electrochemical workstation under a 300 W xenon lamp with AM 1.5 filter (100 mW cm−2).
Construction and measurement of all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor (SC)
SC was fabricated using two film electrodes (0.8 cm × 0.8 cm) and PVDF-HFP/BMIMBF4 gel electrolyte. PVDF-HFP (2 g) was dissolved in DMF (20 mL) at 60 °C for 2 hours, followed by the addition of BMIMBF4 solution (8 g) under stirring for another 2 hours. After that the above gel was poured into the mold overnight, it was cut into a suitable size (1 cm × 1 cm) and placed between two electrodes as electrolyte and diaphragm to assemble all-solid-state SC. The scan rate of cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves, the charge and discharge currents of galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) curves, and the EIS spectra of all-solid-state SC were tested on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, Chenhua, Shanghai).
Construction and measurement of an integrated quasi-solid-state photo-supercapacitor (IPC)
The IPC was a three-electrode solid-state integrated structure composed of five parts from bottom to top: APGF (0.64 cm2), PVDF/HFP-BMIMBF4 gel electrolyte (1 cm2), another APGF as a compatible electrode (0.64 cm2), PVDF/Et23 quasi-solid-state electrolyte (1 cm2), TiO2 photoanode electrode (0.25 cm2). The electrochemical performance of IPC was tested on an electrochemical workstation with a 300 W xenon lamp as a light source. The photo-charge and dark-discharge processes were controlled by a switch, as shown in Fig. 5a. In the process of photo-charging, the switch was turned on to form the closed circuit. Meanwhile, the charging current set by the electrochemical workstation was zero. In the process of dark discharging, the discharge current of IPC was applied via the workstation while the switch was turned off. The cycling performance of IPCs was measured by manually controlling the switch and lighting status and repeating the above steps. For comparison, APF and PF were used as compatible electrodes to assemble IPCs, respectively.
Construction of high-voltage and flexible IPCs
High voltage IPC was realized through the photoanode design. In detail, two FTO glasses of 1.5 cm × 6 cm and 1.5 cm × 4.5 cm were taken and etched using zinc power and HCl as shown in Fig. S12.† The resulting ITO was washed with ethanol and acetone. PEDOT/RGO dispersion was coated on the appropriate position of aforementioned as the counter electrodes, and TiO2 slurry was screen printed on the counter position as a photoanode. Finally, two APGF electrodes and an electrolyte were stacked (Fig. S12†). The test methods were the same as a single IPC, except that both sides were illuminated concurrently. Thus, the DSSC was connected in series inside the IPC, and the charging voltage increased to light the LED.
Electrochemical performance measurements
The specific area capacitance (CA) of the SCs based on two film electrodes and PVDF/HFP-BMIMBF4 gel electrolyte was calculated from the CV curves are as follows:  where I, U, v, and A are the current (A), voltage range (V), scan rate (V s−1), and electrode area (cm2).
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) and fill factor (FF) of the photovoltaic cell were calculated from the J–V curves as follows:    where Vm and Jm are the voltage (V) and the current density (mA cm−2) at the maximum power. Voc and Jsc are the open circuit voltage (V) and short circuit density (mA cm−2), respectively.
The total photochemical-electric energy conversion efficiency (ηtotal) and the energy storage efficiency (ηstorage) from GCD curves as follows:    where Vd, Id, td (t2 − t1), P, tc, and S are the discharge charge voltage (V), discharge current (mA), discharge time (s), light power density (100 mW cm−2), area of photoanode (cm2) and photo-charge time (s), respectively.
Results and discussion
Physical characterization
We prepared a uniform flexible PEDOT film (PF) electrode from a commercial PEDOT:PSS solution, as shown in Fig. 1b. To break the strong binding between PEDOT and PSS chains. First, the PEDOT:PSS aqueous was dropped into a dilute sulfuric acid to remove the out-ring PSS. PSS always acts as a dispersion agent but it also causes poor conductivity. Then, the disk-shaped precipitates were stirred completely and filtered in a vacuum. Finally, the film was dissolved in acetone, and PF was peeled off from the filter membrane. To enhance the conductivity of the electrode, the free-standing PF was immersed in concentrated sulfuric acid again to obtain acid-treated PEDOT film (APF). Similarly, the RGO powder was dispersed evenly and added it to the PF solution and acid-treated to obtain the PEDOT/RGO film (APGF). The APGF possesses certain flexibility and is still intact after being rolled and folded, as shown in Fig. 1c.
The SEM micrographs of PF, APF, and APGF are shown in Fig. 2(a–c). The PF has a well-dispersed smooth surface with micro-grains in the polymer matrix and a layered structure can be observed from the cross-sectional SEM. Defects are introduced after being treated with concentrated sulfuric acid and the surface is uneven. When PSS was removed and the conjugated length of PEDOT chains would be enhanced.32 The layered structure of APF is more obvious and regular. Compared to PF and APF, RGO flakes exhibited a wrinkled structure, as shown in Fig. S1.† Moreover, with the doping of RGO, the π–π interaction between the thiophene ring and the basal planes of RGO, hydrogen bonding between 1,4-dioxane of PEDOT and COOH/OH of RGO, and electrostatic interactions induce the RGO flakes to be completely enveloped by PEDOT.33 From the cross-section, the stratiform structure becomes loose and porous, which is expected to improve the active surface area and adsorption of the electrolyte. Similar conclusions can be obtained from the AFM images (Fig. 2d–f). The height images of PF film with a root-mean-square roughness (RMS) of 48.5 nm. The roughness increased from 48.5 nm to 60.6 nm after acid treatment, and to 122 nm after further doping with RGO.

The composition and interaction of the APGF film are illustrated by Raman spectrum, XRD analysis, and FT-IR spectra, as shown in Fig. 2g–i. As for Raman of PF and APF, two strong peaks at 1516 and 1431 cm−1 are attributed to the asymmetric CC. The two characteristic peaks of GF at 1356 and 1600 cm−1 are assigned to the sp3-bonded carbon atoms of defects and disorders (D-band) and sp2-bonded carbon atoms (G-band). Specifically, compared to GF, the peaks of APGF exhibit a combined feature with the characteristic peaks of RGO and PEDOT and show a red shift due to π–π interactions of electron-rich RGO and the aromatic structures in the PEDOT.34,35 XRD analysis was performed to examine the composition of samples (Fig. 2h). For the PF and APF films, the patterns displayed two signals at ∼16.6° and ∼25.8° indicating the amorphous halo of PSS and the interchain planar ring-stacking distance of PEDOT, respectively. For APGF, the peak at 25.8° becomes broader and the crystal plane diffraction peak at ∼16.6° shifts slightly to a small angle, indicating the increased interlayer spacing due to the intercalated RGO.36,37 The ATR-FTIR of PF and APF showed typical vibrational signatures at 1064.56, 1122.02, and 1262 cm−1 (Fig. 2i) confirming the presence of C–O–C and C–C bonds originated from the ethylene-deoxy groups present in the PEDOT structure. The vibrations at 654–960 cm−1 are ascribed to the C–S vibration mode in the thiophene ring. The characteristic FTIR peaks of GF appeared at 1032 cm−1 (C–O–C), 1384 cm−1 (C–OH), 1636 cm−1 (CC), and 1727 cm−1 (CO). It is worth noting that the peaks of APGF with a minor red shift further suggest that the PEDOT and RGO were successfully assembled.38 The electrical properties of PF, APF, and APGF were tested via the Hall effect measurements and summarized in Table 1. The carrier concentration and conductivity of APGF were higher than those of PF and APF, which provided an advanced performance guarantee for the next photoelectric conversion and storage research.

Electrochemical performance
To improve the interfacial contact between the electrolyte and electrode, an electro-spun PVDF nanofiber membrane combined with liquid electrolytes was provided to fabricate the quasi-solid composite electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 3a, the PVDF membrane is composed of a network of crosslinked nanowires, ensuring the transport of ions and electrons in the electrolyte. Fig. 3b presents the current density voltage (J–V) curves for photovoltaics based on dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode with various counter electrodes. The photovoltaic parameters, for example, Jsc (short-circuit photocurrent density), Voc (open-circuit voltage), FF (fill factor), and PCE (power conversion efficiency) are shown in detail in Table 2. The PCE of APGF was 6.87%, which was higher than that of APF (6.53%) and PF (4.94%), as also underlined by the increase in FF values. The Nyquist plots were employed to analyze the interfacial resistances in Fig. 3c. After fitting through the equivalent circuit model (inset of Fig. 3c), each Nyquist plot included two semicircles, corresponding to the charge transfer resistance between the counter electrode and electrolyte (Rct1) and the surface resistance between the TiO2 photoanode and electrolyte (Rct2). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) parameters are also listed in Table 2 and the APGF with the smallest Rct meant the highest catalytic activity and the lowest potential for an electron transfer. Besides the comparison of different electrodes, the J–V curve and EIS curve based on the liquid-electrolyte with similar PCE and Rct are shown in Fig. S2,† which proved that the PVDF membrane did not impact the photoelectric conversion efficiency. In general, the significant enhancement of APGF performance is mainly from the following aspects. Firstly, the acid treatment and RGO doping provide higher electric conductivity and carrier concentration, resulting in fast reaction kinetics in the reduction of I3− at the counter electrode. Secondly, the high rough surface of APGF increases the adsorption of liquid electrolytes and the number of catalytic active sites for I3− reduction.39,40

To investigate the energy storage capacity and the synergy enhancement of the compatible electrolyte and gel electrolyte, the all-solid-state symmetrical supercapacitors (SC) were assembled with different electrode materials and gel electrolytes into the electrons/ions sandwich structure, as shown in Fig. 4a. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of PF, APF, and APGF at 5 mV s−1 are displayed in Fig. 4b. According to CV, the obtained APGF displays a larger quasi-rectangular CV shape than PF and APF, reflecting its much higher specific capacitance. In accordance with CV results, the galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) curves of the three electrodes at the current of 0.5 mA are similar to an isosceles triangle shape with no obvious IR drop in Fig. 4c, which verified reversible electrochemical performance and fast electrons/ions transport. The outstanding specific capacitance of APGF may result from two aspects: (1) the treatment of sulfuric acid can decrease insulated PSS and greatly improve the conductivity of PF. (2) The addition of RGO also can replace PSS in APF and provide more active reaction sites and transport pathways. Moreover, the electrochemical properties of various gel electrolytes using the APGF as electrode material are shown in Fig. 4d and e. In a similar vein, it was also evaluated with CV curves at 5 mV s−1 and GCD curves at 0.5 mA. Obviously, the specific capacitance of APGF with the BMIMBF4 gel electrolyte was higher than that with an acidic or alkaline electrolyte. Here, the post-treatment with BMIMBF4 ion liquid allows for secondary doping of APGF, the positively charged BMIM cations will electrostatically interact with negatively charged PSS and increase electrical conductivity by carrying positive charge carriers.41,42 To sum up, after optimizing the electrode materials and electrolyte, the maximum specific area capacitance of SC based on APGF and BMIMBF4 gel electrolyte was 418.57 mF cm−2, which overrides that of APGF matching with KOH gel electrolyte (101.43 mF cm−2), H2SO4 gel electrolyte (205.71 mF cm−2), and is also superior to that of BMIMBF4 gel electrolyte coordinating with the PF electrode (239.71 mF cm−2), and APF electrode (307.86 mF cm−2), as shown in Fig. 4f. To investigate the stability of APGF-based SCs, the CV curves at different scanning rates from 2 mV s−1 to 100 mV s−1 were measured, as demonstrated in Fig. 4g. All the CV curves possess a stable shape even at 100 mV s−1, and the current increased with the increase in sweep speed, proving fast charge transfer and high conductivity. The CV curves at diverse scanning speeds and GCD curves at different currents of PF and APF electrodes are exhibited in Fig. S3–S6.† The EIS spectra and the Ragone plots of SCs based on different electrodes and electrolytes are represented in Fig. S7 and S8.† The Ragone plot in Fig. S7† proves that the APGF has better performance than PF and APF as electrodes, meanwhile, the APGF delivers optimized energy density and power density when in the BMIMBF4 gel electrolyte. The excellent electrochemical performance is attributed to the low resistance and high conductivity, as shown in Fig. S8,† which promotes ion diffusion and electron transport efficiently. Fig. 4i exhibits the long-term stability of all-solid-state SC discharged at 1 mA, the specific capacitance was still maintained at 89.5% after 1000 cycles, demonstrating excellent stability, which further verified the fast charge transfer for the coordination of the APGF and BMIMBF4 electrolyte.

Quasi-solid-state IPCs performance
The quasi-solid-state IPCs were constructed by vertically stacking a TiO2/dye photoanode as the optical receiver and optoelectronic generator, an APGF as a storage electrode to receive electronics, and another APGF in the middle to separate electron–hole pairs and store charges quickly (Fig. 5a). In detail, under illumination, the photogenerated electrons originating from the dye and I−/I3− electrolyte were transmitted to the PEDOT/RGO film through an external circuit and stored. When darkness falls, part of the electrons are used to regenerate the dye, and part of the electrons are used to power the load. To evaluate the energy conversion behavior of the IPCs, the solar-to-output energy conversion (total conversion efficiency (TCE)) and energy storage efficiency (ESE) were calculated from photo-charge/galvanostatic-discharge (PC-GD) curves using the following equations.

The PC-GD curves of IPCs with PF, APF, and APGF as the common electrodes are shown in Fig. 5b. When IPC was exposed to sunlight without additional current, the voltage of IPCs rises to 0.55 V in a short time. Then, the IPCs were discharged at 2 mA without illumination, the photo-charge and dark-discharge time are shown in Table 3. After device optimization, the TCE of IPC based on APGF can reach 5.81%, which is superior to 5.34% of APGF and 3.39% of GF. Meanwhile, the highest ESE also appeared from the ICP based on APF as compatible electrodes, which reached 84.57%. The excellent TCE and ESE are ascribed to the triple modification of acid, ionic liquid, and graphene doping of APGF-compatible electrodes. The capacitance of the storage part and electron transfer rate is greatly improved. In particular, the BMIMBF4 gel electrolyte is neutral, which contributes to the compatibility of the stacked IPCs. In contrast, KOH and H2SO4 gel electrolytes will penetrate and corrode the photoanode through the intermediate electrode, which is incapable of realizing the photo-charging process (Fig. S9†). In order to verify the stability of IPCs, the IPCs were discharged at various currents and in multiple cycles (Fig. 5c and d). The TCE values of the self-charging module were calculated to be 5.01, 5.13, 5.45, 5.68, 5.72, and 5.81% for discharge currents of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2 mA, respectively. These are obviously better than those of PF and APF, as shown in Fig. S10.† The IPC circulated for 50 cycles under a large current of 2 mA, as shown in Fig. 5d, the TCEs in the first three cycles were 5.28, 5.61, and 5.69%. The TCEs were 4.96, 4.49, and 4.45% in the last three cycles and the initial conversion efficiency was maintained at 84.3% during the cycling test. Besides, the self-discharging of IPC based on various compatible electrodes is shown in Fig. S11.† The long self-discharge time proved that the IPC based on APGF can mitigate the current leakage behavior.

As mentioned above, IPCs have been proven to simultaneously realize photoelectric conversion and energy storage. To meet the practical needs of IPCs, the high-voltage IPC was designed via a series connection of photoanodes and counter electrodes, as shown in Fig. S12.† Here, the series photoanode modules are connected by etching the circuit on FTO instead of the external circuit. When the light was irradiated on the two sides of IPC, the photo-excited electrons accumulated on the photoanode and transferred to the surface of the storage electrode. The J–V curves and the open-circuit voltage of the series photoanode modules are presented in Fig. S13a and S13b.† The voltage can reach 2.3 V instantaneously with illumination. Fig. S14† displays the electrochemical performance of SC based on the BMIMBF4 gel electrolyte at different voltage windows. When the voltage was extended to 1.5 V, the shape of the CV and GCD curves were not significantly deformed. Fig. 6a depicts the charging and self-discharging behavior of high-voltage IPCs. This high-voltage IPC can be charged to 1.5 V in 42 seconds and the voltage is depleted over time by IPC in response to different externally applied currents. The stored photo charges can support a longer discharge with the illumination area increasing. The TCE values of high-voltage IPC were 5.1%, 5.23%, 5.3%, 5.29%, and 5.5%, under applied currents of 0.25 mA, 0.5 mA, 1.0 mA, 1.5 mA, and 2.0 mA. Subsequently, the stored energy of IPC was successfully used to drive red LEDs without external current (Fig. S15†). The long-term stability of high-voltage IPC was tested in an ambient atmosphere in Fig. 6b. This IPC experiences 50 photo-charge/galvanostatic-discharge cycles at 2 mA. The inset in Fig. 6b reveals that the TCE values of IPC at the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 48th, 49th, and 50th cycles were 5.51%, 5.48%, 5.45%, 4.88%, 4.85%, and 4.78%, respectively, which keeps 86.75% of the initial cycle.

(d) Schematic diagram of charge-separated transition mechanism between the compatible film and gel electrolyte. 
To adapt to the development of flexible intelligent electronics, ITO-PET was selected as a conductive collector instead of FTO (Fig. 6c inset) to assemble the flexible IPCs. In the photo-charge performance of flexible IPCs (Fig. 6c), the charging time increases slightly due to the weak contact between ITO-PET and TiO2, and the TCE of this IPC can reach 4.99% at 0.25 mA. Here, the outstanding performance of IPC contributed to the charge-separated transition mechanism of the PEDOT/RGO film and ion electrolyte, as shown in Fig. 6d. First, the autoproteolysis of concentrate H2SO4 can stabilize the segregated states of PEDOT and PSS and change the crystallographic and nanofibril structure of PEDOT. Several uncoupled PSS species also can be removed by H2SO4 to increase the conductivity. Next, due to the π–π interaction between the thiophene ring and the basal planes of RGO, as well as the hydrogen bonding between 1,4-dioxane of PEDOT and COOH/OH of RGO, the RGO was successfully assembled on PEDOT to enhance the effective surface area, carrier mobility and carrier concentration (Table 1), which is conducive to good electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction and the strong charge storage ability. Finally, the BMIMBF4 ionic liquid also provides significant polar interaction and affinity with PEDOT to improve the electronic transmission capacity.43–45 Hence, the photoelectrons originating from illumination can quickly move to the electrode to make it display negative electricity and adsorb cations in the electrolyte. The anions and cations of ion liquid gathered on the electrode surface not only improve charge storage but also can modify the conductivity of the electrode and regenerate the dye. Based on this mechanism, the IPC in this work shows excellent conversion efficiency and cycle performance.
Conclusion
In summary, this work provides a novel quasi-solid-state IPC using PEDOT/RGO as a common electrode to solve incompatibility problems. With the coordination of the BMIMBF4 gel electrolyte, the compatible electrode exhibits efficient photoelectric conversion and high charge storage capacity. Hence, this IPC possesses excellent performance in the overall conversion efficiency (5.8%) and the energy storage efficiency (84.57%). This conversion efficiency is superior compared to the most reported photoelectric conversion and storage integration devices built on dye-sensitized photoanodes. In addition, taking advantage of the flexibility and operability of the PEDOT/RGO film, wearable and practical self-power devices will be realized to adapt to a wide range of future.
