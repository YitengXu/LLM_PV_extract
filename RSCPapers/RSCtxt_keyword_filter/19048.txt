    , Accepted 21st April 2022First published on 21st April 2022AbstractThe morphology of organic solar cells (OSCs) is a core topic for achieving the ultimate photovoltaic performance. Herein, we focused on the combination of two important morphology regulation strategies, i.e., ternary strategy and cosolvent engineering. Using an amorphous polymer acceptor, BN-T, as the third component, the PM6:BTP-eC11 and PM6:eC9 host binary systems, treated by the o-xylene and 1-phenylnaphthalene solvent system and chlorobenzene and 1,8-diiodooctane solvent system, respectively, both realized an effective improvement in the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). However, the ex situ morphological characterization revealed that these two systems undergo different types of changes in phase segregation and molecular packing, which cannot be understood by the current popular miscibility analysis. In this work, an in situ investigation was carried out during the spin casting and thermal annealing processes. The time-resolved reflection spectroscopy technique showed that BN-T retained more PN in the ternary films during the casting process, thereby facilitating the aggregation of eC11 and enlarging its domain size. In contrast, the incorporation of BN-T did not affect the DIO content in the films, resulting in a less separated morphology for the eC9-based systems, as predicted by the miscibility study. In addition to state-of-the-art PCEs, this work provides an insightful understanding of the morphology evolution in ternary OSCs assisted by a high-boiling solvent additive via in situ investigation techniques.

Broader context
Constructing ternary blends has become one of the most popular strategies to enhance the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs), resulting in the best single-junction OSC efficiencies to date. During the morphology study, the majority of the research on the ternary blends was focused on the interaction among the three materials, ignoring the influence of the co-solvent on the ternary system. Herein, we carefully analyzed two ternary systems processed using two co-solvent systems by screening the formation of films via a home-built time-resolved UV reflection/absorption setup. One binary host system is CB + DIO co-solvent-processed PM6:eC9, while other is XY + PN non-halogenated co-solvent-treated PM6:eC11. The amorphous polymer acceptor BN-T was chosen as the third component in these two systems. For the first time, we provide a deep understanding on the role of the co-solvent in achieving highly efficient ternary OSCs. Consequently, a PCE of 18.49% was achieved by CB + DIO co-solvent-processed PM6:eC9 and 18.02% for XY + PN. Notably, 18.02% is among the highest values for OSCs with a non-halogenated main solvent and solvent additive in the active layer. Furthermore, the PCE of 18.49% was promoted to 18.96% by applying PEDOT:PSS modification, one of the highest values to date.

Introduction
Solution-processed bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs) have acquired >18% power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in various reports due to the success of new materials and morphology optimization strategies.1–15 Also, further efficiency gains are expected from the better understanding and more logical optimization of thin-film morphology, in parallel with new materials and interface engineering. To date, hundreds of photoactive materials have been produced with promising initial performances, where device engineering is critical to unleash the potential of these materials to achieve desirable morphologies and efficiencies. Among the device engineering approaches, the ternary-component strategy has become the most popular topic in recent years.16–35 Pursuing favorable morphological evolution in ternary systems is at the core of optimizing new OSC materials towards excellent performances. Consequently, one of the main goals of OSC research is to determine the morphology tuning effect of the ternary-component strategy. However, most research on high-performance ternary systems focuses primarily on the interaction of the three components in active layer via ex situ characterization.36–38 The possible impacts of the material-co-solvent interactions on the film formation are invisible in these studies. Thus, to fully understand the formation of ternary blend films, in situ observation is necessary, but synchrotron beamline-enabled set-ups such as in situ GIWAXS/GISAXS are not easily available. Besides the comprehensive investigation of the morphology of binary films, in situ characterization can give more insights into ternary films.39–44
Herein, we fabricated ternary blends with BN-T (poly[3,9-didodecyl-4,4,10,10-tetraphenyl-4,10-dihydrothieno[3′,2′:3,4][1,2]azaborolo[1,5-a]thieno[3′,2′:3,4][1,2]azaborolo[1,5-d]pyrazine-5,11-diium-4,10-diuide-co-2,5-thiophene]),45 a polymer acceptor proven to be amorphous in films (independently contributing nothing to crystallinity or phase separation), using two cutting-edge binary blends processed with different co-solvents, i.e., PM6 (poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)-4-fluorothiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-co-(1,3-di(5-thiophene-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione):eC11 (2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((12,13-bis(2-butyloctyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-]thieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]indole-2,10-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-dichloro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile])) with ortho-xylene (XY) and 1-phenylnaphthalene (PN) and PM6:eC9 (2,2′-[[12,13-bis(2-butyloctyl)-12,13-dihydro-3,9-dinonylbisthieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-e:2′,3′-g][2,1,3]benzothiadiazole-2,10-diyl]bis[methylidyne(5,6-chloro-3-oxo-1H-indene-2,1(3H)-diylidene)]bis[propanedinitrile]]) with chlorobenzene (CB) and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO).46–48 Given that BN-T was proven to be effective in promoting the performance of the PM6:PY-IT system and PY-IT is a polymerized BTP-core based small molecule, we believed that they can also work with PM6:eC11 and PM6:eC9, presenting a new opportunity in the scientific understanding of these state-of-the-art efficiency OSC systems.26 Consequently, the efficiency of the PM6:eC11:BN-T ternary devices increased from 17.15% to 18.10% in the binary counterpart, which is among the highest for OSCs processed by non-halogenated solvent(s) and non-halogenated solvent additive(s).
Meanwhile, the PCE of the PM6:eC9:BN-T ternary target was 18.49% (17.75% for the binary control), which further improved to 18.96% by employing a reported interface engineering. Both ternary OSCs were found to exhibit cutting-edge PCE levels, implying the importance of further morphological understanding based on them. We discovered that these two ternary blends underwent different morphology variation routes due to crystallinity and phase separation issues. The miscibility analysis can explain the change in the eC9-based ternary series, but it fails to explain the change in the eC11-based ternary series, signaling that a separate factor dominated in the morphology formation. The addition of BN-T resulted in the presence of more PN after spinning and created a more segregated phase distribution, according to the time-resolved reflectance measurement. In contrast, the PM6:eC9:BN-T films did not exhibit any variations in solvent additive (DIO) retention, resulting in phase separation, which is consistent with the miscibility prediction alone. This work uses ternary designs to generate high-performance OSCs, provides in-depth morphological understandings, and presents a novel and instructive technique for studying the working mechanism of ternary systems.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a displays the chemical structures of the fabricated photovoltaic materials, while Fig. 1b depicts their energy level distribution, as determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements (Fig. S1, ESI†). PM6, eC11, eC9, and BN-T exhibit the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) values of −5.55, −5.61, −5.70, and −5.60 eV and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) values of −3.54, −4.05, −4.02, and −3.62 eV, respectively. The energy levels of BN-T are well aligned with that of the host systems. Fig. S2a (ESI†) shows the normalized UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of the XY + PN processed PM6, eC11, BN-T, and mixed acceptor-based films and Fig. S2b (ESI†) depicts that of the CB + DIO-processed PM6, eC9, and BN-T. When PM6 was treated with XY + PN and CB + DIO, its absorbance remained almost unchanged, suggesting that these two co-solvents have no effect on its aggregation capabilities. In the case of BN-T, different absorption profiles were observed. Specifically, the XY + PN-processed BN-T film exhibited a lower 0-0 vibrational peak than that of the CB + DIO-processed BN-T film, but a stronger 0-1 vibrational peak, indicating that H-aggregation was more prominent in the XY + PN cast film. The 0-0 vibrational peak of the eC11 film processed by XY + PN was significant, surpassing the other two peaks for the monomers and H-aggregates; however, the 0-1 peak of the CB + DIO-cast eC9 has the same intensity trend as the 0-0 peak, indicating that J-aggregation is less dominant.49,50 Both eC11 (XY + PN) and eC9 (CB + DIO) exhibited a blue shift in their absorption in the constructed BN-T-integrated acceptor films, which implies the presence of less J-aggregates after the incorporation BN-T. These phenomena indicate that BN-T played a vital role in regulating the aggregation of both systems.

Fig. 1c and d illustrate the absorption spectra of the PM6:eC11:BN-T (1:1.2:0, 1:1.2:0.1, and 1:1.2:0.2) film processed using XY and PN and that of the PM6:eC9:BN-T (1:1.2:0, 1:1.2:0.1, 1:1.2:0.2) film processed using CB and DIO. It can be observed that by incorporating BN-T, the normal absorption of the XY + PN-treated films increases, suggesting the tuning effect promoted the global aggregation of eC11. By comparison, PM6:eC9 (CB + DIO) exhibited an excellent balance between its donor and acceptor absorption, indicating that that its initial aggregation is good. The addition of extra BN-T had a negligible influence on the absorption profiles of the films, but it increased the general aggregation tendency of both PM6 and eC9.
Subsequently, a series of binary and ternary solar cells were fabricated to assess the influence of the incorporation of BN-T. The composition was motivated by a recent study in which the PM6:BN-T blend demonstrated a poor device performance, and thus BN-T was added to the host systems as a third component. The optimal proportions for the ternary blends were found to be 1:1.2:0.1 for both the PM6:eC11:BN-T (XY + PN)- and PM6:eC9:BN-T (CB + DIO)-based devices. In comparison to the binary control system, the optimal PM6:eC11:BN-T-based solar cell simultaneously exhibited an improved open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF), and enhanced PCE from 17.15% to 18.02%. When the content of BN-T increased, the efficiency declined to 17.56%. Notably, the high PCE of 18.02% was achieved by using fully non-halogenated co-solvents (XY + PN), which is among the highest level for this type of OSCs. Table S1 and Fig. S3a (ESI†) summarize the efficiencies produced by the pure non-halogenated solvent, a non-halogenated main solvent with halogenated solvent additive, and non-halogenated main solvent with non-halogenated solvent additive. The benefits of the non-halogenated additive over its halogenated counterparts are well discussed in the literature.51,52 This brief comparison confirms that the performance obtained herein is at the cutting-edge of current OSC research, making upcoming morphology analyses more meaningful. The optimal efficiency of the CB + DIO-co-solvent treated devices based on PM6:eC9:BN-T was 18.49%, which is not substantially better than 17.75% of the binary control, supporting the abovementioned hypothesis that the morphological tuning effect of BN-T is not equally significant. Table 1 lists all the parameters and Fig. 1e and h show the current density versus voltage (J–V) curves of the best device in each group. These best results were from at least 20 independent devices, as shown in Fig. 1f and g. In addition, interface engineering was utilized to further improve the PCE of the optimal system.53 The J–V curves and EQE spectra are presented in Fig. S3b and c (ESI†), respectively. Consequently, the PCE was as high as 18.96%, which can compete with the most advanced progress in the field of OSCs.

The brackets contain the average and standard error of the PCEs based on at least 20 devices.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of each system was tested to ensure the accuracy of the results. The integrated JSC values are also shown in Table 1 (after the slashes). The results suggest that the measured values are within 2.5% error. Furthermore, the EQE response for the absorption peak of eC11 improved in the ternary devices, which is consistent with the optical observations. In the case of the eC9-based solar cells, the EQE spectra display very similar shapes, also consistent with previous measurements.
Subsequently, we performed device physics analyses to screen the change caused by BN-T. We measured the photocurrent versus effective voltage (Jphvs. Veff) and JSCversus light intensity (JSCvs. Plight) characteristics of the target and control systems. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the charge separation and extraction displayed no distinct change among the binary and ternary blends. The S values of PM6:eC11:BN-T are 0.986, 0.991, and 0.982 for the weight ratios of 1:1.2:0, 1:1.2:0.1, and 1:1.2:0.2, respectively, indicating that bimolecular recombination is reduced in the optimal ternary blend. These values are 0.989, 0.994 and 0.987 for the PM6:eC9:BN-T systems with the weight ratio of 1:1.2:0, 1:1.2:0.1 and 1:1.2:0.2, respectively. However, the JSCvs. Plight relationships are not meaningful here because the trap-assisted recombination is thoroughly dominated by bimolecular recombination at 1 Sun illumination.
Next, we evaluated the mobilities of each active layer using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The fabrication steps for the hole-only and electron-only devices are described in the ESI.† The results for the hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) are plotted in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The derived μhs is 4.09 × 10−4, 7.19 × 10−4, and 6.26 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an increase in BN-T in the XY + PN cast PM6:eC11 blend and μes is 1.40 × 10−3, 1.72 × 10−3 and 1.29 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The optimal blend exhibited the most efficient and balanced charge transport. In the case of the CB + DIO-processed PM6:eC9:BN-T films, the (μh and μe) values for the 1:1.2:0, 1:1.2:0.1 and 1:1.2:0.2 mass scale combinations are (4.00 × 10−4 and 14.1 × 10−4), (6.34 × 10−4 and 17.5 × 10−4) and (6.19 × 10−4 and 14.5 × 10−4) cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, demonstrating their similar variation tendency. Both optimized ternary blends exhibited more efficient and balanced charge transport compared with their binary counterparts, consistent with their superior performances and suppressed bimolecular recombination.
Subsequently, the existence of energy transfer and charge transfer between the acceptors was investigated. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the eC11:BN-T (XY) and eC9:BN-T(CB) films were measured and devices based on acceptor(s) without the presence of PM6 were also fabricated. The results are summarized in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The results suggest that slight energy transfer takes place from eC11 to BN-T in their XY cast films, and from eC9 to BN-T in the CB cast layers. Charge transfer was also observed in both ternary blends. These results are in accordance with the previous reports.
Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) experiments were performed to investigate the molecular packing characteristics of each blend.54–58 The 2D patterns and corresponding line cuts are shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively, while the calculated parameters are summarized in Tables S2–S5 (ESI†). The d-spacing and crystalline coherence length (CCL) values for both systems are also shown in Fig. 2c and d, respectively, to present the variation in molecular packing. In the case of the XY + PN-processed PM6:eC11:BN-T systems, increasing the content of BN-T did not affect the d-spacing for the in-plane (IP) directional lamellar peaks, but PM6:eC11:BN-T with the weight ratio of 1:1.1:0.1 exhibited the largest CCL. The out-of-plane (OOP) lamellar peaks also showed no significant position shift, but the CCLs continuously dropped with an increase in the proportion of BN-T. The fitting results show two coupled π–π peaks along the OOP direction. The peak with smaller d-spacing values exhibits CCLs increasing from 32.59 Å to 38.75 Å and 44.06 Å. Because BN-T was previously proven to be amorphous, this may explain the lower lamellar packing crystallinity. However, the improved crystallinity for the π–π peaks, as well as the variation in CCL of the IP directional lamellar peaks must be linked to BN-T in a more complicated way.

(c) d-Spacing and CCL variation with an increase in BN-T content in the XY + PN-treated films: in-plane lamellar peak (blue); out-of-plane lamellar peak (green); and out-of-plane π–π peak (orange). (d) d-Spacing and CCL variation with an increase in BN-T content in the CB + DIO-treated films: in-plane lamellar peak (blue); out-of-plane lamellar peak (green); and out-of-plane π–π peak (orange). As previously stated, ex situ observations were first used to obtain basic information, given that the morphology study is the basis of this work and fundamentally required for understanding the device performances. 
The packing change tendency in the CB + DIO-processed eC9 based blend films differs from that in the XY + PN-processed PM6:eC11:BN-T blend film. The IP lamellar peaks exhibit a slight drop in CCL values (79.17 Å, 77.05 Å, and 74.75 Å for 1:1.2:0, 1:1.2:0.1, and 1:1.2:0.2 ratios), and that of the lamellar peaks of the OOP direction increase from 64.74 Å to 72.84 Å and 84.09 Å, respectively. Besides, the OOP π–π peaks are located at 1.792 Å−1, 1.824 Å−1, and 1.812 Å−1 with CCLs of 21.77 Å, 23.60 Å, and 22.56 Å for the PM6:eC9:BN-T blends with weight ratios of 1:1.2:0, 1:1.2:0.1 and 1:1.2:0.2, respectively. This phenomenon suggests that adding BN-T can enhance the face-on orientation and subtly tune the crystallinity. The GIWAXS results for the two material systems processed by two co-solvent combinations display very different changes. Consequently, the morphological tuning impact of BN-T cannot be explained solely by investigating its interactions with the host materials (PM6:eC11 and PM6:eC9), which is generally enabled by the miscibility study.
The phase separation length scales of the targeted blends were measured via the grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) technique using the Debye-Anderson-Brumberger equation as the fitting model.59–62Fig. 3a and d show the experimental results and fitting curves for PM6:eC11:BN-T (XY + PN) and PM6:eC9:BN-T (CB + DIO), respectively. Fig. S7 (ESI†) shows their two-dimensional patterns. The calculated domain sizes are also shown in the graphs (Fig. 3a and d), where 2Rg represents the length scale of the most crystalline material and XDAB is the size of the intermixing phase. Herein, eC11 and eC9 exhibited the strongest crystallinity in their own blends because the XY + PN-processed eC11 neat film and CB + DIO-processed eC9 neat film displayed foggy surfaces; meanwhile, the XY + PN- and CB + DIO-processed PM6 and BN-T films exhibited normal smooth surfaces. The PM6:eC11 binary film was found to exhibit a pure acceptor phase with 12.6 nm length scale and an intermixing domain of 76.2 nm, suggesting efficient charge dissociation and extraction but potentially stronger bimolecular recombination. Then the optimal PM6:eC11:BN-T (1:1.2:0.1) blend exhibited an eC11 domain with a length scale of 25.2 nm and a mixed phase with a length scale of 41.3 nm, which potentially achieves a balance between efficient charge dissociation and transport. When the BN-T amount increased to 0.2, the length scales of the eC11 domain and mixed phase declined to 20.8 and 32.7 nm, respectively. Fig. 2b shows a comparison of the PL quenching, which verifies this conclusion, with the binary control film having the maximum quenching efficiency and the ternary target film having a lower value. The reduced phase separation is consistent with the effect of BN-T of alleviating the excessive J-aggregation of eC11. This change could facilitate a balance between charge generation and transport.

Next, we concentrated on the domain size change in the CB + DIO-processed system. The PM6:eC9-based active layer was calculated to have a 22.6 nm pure acceptor phase and a 20.8 nm intermixing phase, implying a well-distributed film morphology. The optimal PM6:eC9:BN-T (1:1.2:0.1) exhibited an eC9 domain with a length scale of 15.4 nm and a mixed phase of ∼ 33.4 nm. This film achieved a more intermixing phase (49.2 nm) with a decreased pure acceptor domain of 10.8 nm when the BN-T fraction was 0.2. These results are displayed in Fig. 2d and are consistent with the PL quenching efficiency comparison for each ratio depicted in Fig. 2e. Afterwards, atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies were employed to examine the surface morphological change in PM6:eC11:BN-T (XY + PN) and PM6:eC9:BN-T (CB + DIO), as depicted in Fig. S8 and S9 (ESI†), respectively. The observed variation tendencies of the phase segregation in both series are consistent with the GISAXS technology-based calculation.
To understand the morphology evolutions in this work, we performed a miscibility analysis based on the surface tension of each material. The contact angles of water and ethylene glycol on the films are displayed in Fig. S10 and S11 (ESI†), respectively. The surface tension of the PM6 films treated with XY + PN and CB + DIO is comparable; however, that of the BN-T neat films cast by the two co-solvents is quite different, consistent with their absorption profile changes. The surface tension of eC11 cast by XY + PN and eC9 cast by CB + DIO was also obtained, as displayed in Fig. 3c and f, respectively. According to the Flory-Huggins interaction theory and prior OSC studies, PM6 and eC9 tend to form well-separated phases. The addition of BN-T can reduce the phase separation, resulting in smaller crystallites and larger intermixing domains. This deduction can properly describe the role of BN-T in the CB + DIO-cast PM6:eC9 systems. However, the miscibility study failed in the prediction of the XY + PN-processed PM6:eC11:BN-T series, where PM6 and eC11 should also demonstrate significant phase separation in the binary films. After the introduction of BN-T, the ternary films should go through a process of reducing the pure acceptor phase length scales and enlarging the intermixing domain sizes. However, this prediction contradicts the experimental findings.
In the following step, we used time-resolved reflectance measurement to understand the transition from solution to treated film(s), and the operating mode is depicted in Fig. S12 (ESI†). The collected data are depicted as 2D contour maps, where the colors represent the reflectance signal intensity at a specific time and wavelength; subsequently, the time-resolved absorbance at fixed wavelengths of the films was extracted and derived. These results are all demonstrated in Fig. 4. The aggregation durations of the ternary films were shown to be longer than that of their binary counterparts for the XY + PN-processed series by tracking the absorbance at 820 nm, implying that the incorporation of BN-T additive retained more solvent(s), especially the higher boiling point solvent (PN). Therefore, the solvent additive removal process could be easily observed by screening the annealing-induced absorption change (Fig. 4h) for the ternary blends, where the absorption intensities went through a ca. 6-second drop, indicating the fast evaporation of the high boiling point solvent additive PN.

PM6:eC11:BN-T (XY + PN) spinning: (a) 1:1.2:0, (b) 1:1.2:0.1, and (c) 1:1.2:0.2 and annealing: (e) 1:1.2:0, (f) 1:1.2:0.1, and (g) 1:1.2:0.2. PM6:eC9:BN-T (CB + DIO) spinning: (i) 1:1.2:0, (j) 1:1.2:0.1, and (k) 1:1.2:0.2 and annealing: (m) 1:1.2:0, (n) 1:1.2:0.1, and (o) 1:1.2:0.2. Calculated time-resolved absorption intensity variations for all the blends at various positions: (d) spun PM6:eC11:BN-T systems at 820 nm; (h) annealed of PM6:eC11:BN-T films at 820 nm; (l) spun PM6:eC9:BN-T systems at 830 nm; and (p) annealed PM6:eC9:BN-T films at 830 nm. 
In contrast, the binary film displayed a very short and vague stage of PN evaporation, implying the significantly lower PN retention after spinning. Considering the prolonged film drying time and solvent additive removal period, the incorporation of BN-T is believed to impede the considerable evaporation of PN during the spinning.45 In this case, the final morphology should be determined not only by the interaction among the active materials, but also the different evaporation processes of PN. The CB + DIO-processed eC9-based films were also investigated. According to Fig. 4l, the longest aggregation time was achieved with the 1:1.2:0.1 ratio, which may partially explain its strongest π–π crystallinity, but the time differences are not equally significant. The time-dependent absorption intensities for eC9 in the films under thermal annealing (Fig. 4p) exhibit highly similar profiles, implying that the DIO removal processes are almost uniform. This phenomenon indicates that the DIO residual ratio in the films is quite similar; specifically, adding BN-T does not effectively increase or decrease the content of DIO after spinning, and thus the morphology differences for this series may be attributed primarily to the interaction among the photoactive materials.
To further reveal the aggregation behavior of BN-T in the presence of the two co-solvents, the real-time reflectance spectra of the neat film formation process were also measured, as shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†). It can be easily observed that BN-T has a longer drying time during spin casting in the XY + PN co-solvent than in CB + DIO, which is consistent with the previous discussion. Meanwhile, the real-time observation of the thermal annealing process implies that more solvent was removed from the XY + PN-cast film than the CB + DIO-processed film, also supporting the aforementioned hypothesis. Moreover, we employed Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy technology to gain a better understanding of the BN-T effect. Fig. S14 (ESI†) shows that the XY + PN-cast film exhibits significant peaks in the range of 750 to 800 cm−1, which reflect the substitution bonds of benzene, corresponding to PN. Meanwhile, the other characteristic peaks show no differences. This result demonstrates that BN-T could significantly retain more PN in the film until thermal annealing is applied, hence substantiating the abovementioned supposition.
To demonstrate the morphology evolution in this work as clearly as possible, based on the evidence obtained, a schematic diagram of the PM6:eC11:BN-T (XY + PN) systems is presented in Fig. 5. Previous time-resolved studies showed that primary solvents such as CB, XY, and o-DCB are basically eliminated after spinning, leaving solvent additives such as DIO, PN, and 1-CN as the dominant liquid composition in the films.36 Herein, an extremely small quantity of PN remained in the film for the binary system, resulting in a well-miscible donor-acceptor interpenetrating morphology. When 0.1 BN-T was included, PN continuously strengthened the phase segregation, resulting in the formation of more and larger pure eC11 domains. When the BN-T ratio increased to 0.2, the mixing domains were further reduced, enabling more pure acceptor phases. However, the length scales of the acceptor phases were slightly smaller, which is probably because BN-T is highly amorphous in the film. We attribute this intricate morphological evolution to the coupling and competition between the improved phase segregation caused by the BN-T-induced larger PN retention and the weakened segregation caused by the amorphous BN-T. This can also explain the subtle variation in the crystallinity of the PM6:eC11:BN-T films. In the case of the CB + DIO-cast PM6:eC9:BN-T films, the introduction of BN-T had a negligible impact on the retention of the solvent additive. Consequently, the removal of DIO is expected to result in equal morphological changes during casting and after treatment. As mentioned in the miscibility study, the main changes in morphology are driven by the interaction among PM6, BN-T, and eC9. Thus, the intricate change in crystallinities observed here is consistent with our prior study based on an all-polymer system.26

Conclusion
In summary, cutting-edge efficiencies were first achieved for both non-halogenated and halogenated co-solvent-processed ternary OSCs with an amorphous polymer acceptor (BN-T). Although the simple miscibility scenario enabled a reasonable understanding of the morphological changes in the PM6:eC9:BN-T blend films of different weight ratios cast from CB + DIO precursors, it failed to explain the XY + PN-cast PM6:eC11:BN-T system behaviors. Time-resolved reflectance spectroscopy revealed that the abnormity is due to the new phenomenon that BN-T could retain more solvent additive in the film, resulting in highly different evolution routes for morphology formation. This work provides a deeper understanding of the thin film morphology tuning effect of the ternary-component strategy, emphasizes the role of co-solvent selection, and provides a new and facile in situ characterization method to investigate the working mechanism when ex situ observation results contradict the prediction of the popular miscibility analysis.

Broader context
Constructing ternary blends has become one of the most popular strategies to enhance the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs), resulting in the best single-junction OSC efficiencies to date. During the morphology study, the majority of the research on the ternary blends was focused on the interaction among the three materials, ignoring the influence of the co-solvent on the ternary system. Herein, we carefully analyzed two ternary systems processed using two co-solvent systems by screening the formation of films via a home-built time-resolved UV reflection/absorption setup. One binary host system is CB + DIO co-solvent-processed PM6:eC9, while other is XY + PN non-halogenated co-solvent-treated PM6:eC11. The amorphous polymer acceptor BN-T was chosen as the third component in these two systems. For the first time, we provide a deep understanding on the role of the co-solvent in achieving highly efficient ternary OSCs. Consequently, a PCE of 18.49% was achieved by CB + DIO co-solvent-processed PM6:eC9 and 18.02% for XY + PN. Notably, 18.02% is among the highest values for OSCs with a non-halogenated main solvent and solvent additive in the active layer. Furthermore, the PCE of 18.49% was promoted to 18.96% by applying PEDOT:PSS modification, one of the highest values to date.

 	Fig. 2  (a) 2D GIWAXS patterns and (b) in-plane and out-of-plane line-cuts for each system. (c) d-Spacing and CCL variation with an increase in BN-T content in the XY + PN-treated films: in-plane lamellar peak (blue); out-of-plane lamellar peak (green); and out-of-plane π–π peak (orange). (d) d-Spacing and CCL variation with an increase in BN-T content in the CB + DIO-treated films: in-plane lamellar peak (blue); out-of-plane lamellar peak (green); and out-of-plane π–π peak (orange). As previously stated, ex situ observations were first used to obtain basic information, given that the morphology study is the basis of this work and fundamentally required for understanding the device performances.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) In-plane GISAXS intensity plots and fitting curves for XY + PN-processed PM6:eC11:BN-T systems. (b) PL spectra of eC11 neat film and blend films incorporating eC11. (c) Surface tension values of PM6, eC11 and BN-T films processed by XY + PN. (d) In-plane GISAXS intensity plots and fitting curves for CB + DIO-processed PM6:eC9:BN-T systems. (e) PL spectra of eC9 neat film and blend films bearing eC9. (f) Surface tension values of PM6, eC9 and BN-T films processed by CB + DIO.	 

 	Fig. 4  Contour maps of time-wavelength-reflection intensity for the spinning and annealing process. PM6:eC11:BN-T (XY + PN) spinning: (a) 1:1.2:0, (b) 1:1.2:0.1, and (c) 1:1.2:0.2 and annealing: (e) 1:1.2:0, (f) 1:1.2:0.1, and (g) 1:1.2:0.2. PM6:eC9:BN-T (CB + DIO) spinning: (i) 1:1.2:0, (j) 1:1.2:0.1, and (k) 1:1.2:0.2 and annealing: (m) 1:1.2:0, (n) 1:1.2:0.1, and (o) 1:1.2:0.2. Calculated time-resolved absorption intensity variations for all the blends at various positions: (d) spun PM6:eC11:BN-T systems at 820 nm; (h) annealed of PM6:eC11:BN-T films at 820 nm; (l) spun PM6:eC9:BN-T systems at 830 nm; and (p) annealed PM6:eC9:BN-T films at 830 nm.
