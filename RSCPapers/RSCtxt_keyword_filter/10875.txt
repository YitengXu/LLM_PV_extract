1. Introduction
Self-powered wearable optoelectronics have attracted a great deal of attention from researchers, as they are promising candidates to provide sustainable and mobile visual communication for a hyper-connected society.1–6 For instance, self-powered optical sensors can be conformally attached to the curved and dynamic surface of human skin, enabling smart textiles and electronic skins to collect light-based information in real time.3,7–21 A number of research groups have employed inorganic materials such as Ag, Cu, Pb(Zrx,Ti(1−x)O3 (PZT)), InGaAs, InGaN, and AlGaInP in developing flexible conductors, energy harvesters, photodetectors, and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to demonstrate self-powered optoelectronic components.22–28 However, high temperature processes including thermal evaporation deposition, furnace annealing and epitaxial growth cause serious heat shrinkage/expansion of polymer substrates, leading to non-compatibility of electronic and energy materials including metals, III–V compounds and piezoelectric ceramics.29–42 Although carbon-based organic materials exhibit high mechanical flexibility and low temperature production capability, their insufficient electrical/optical properties restrict fundamental improvement in various aspects of device performance such as energy conversion efficiency, light-detection sensitivity, and luminous efficacy.43–48
Light-material interface (LMI) technology has significant potential to offer novel solutions for realizing a self-powered wearable optoelectronic system due to its exclusive feature to control the interfacial structure and chemistry between electronic materials via instantaneous mass transport, atomic diffusion, and carrier recombination.34,49–57 Light irradiated on nanomaterials can generate an intensive interfacial reaction by various light-material interaction mechanisms including localized surface plasmon resonance, photo-reduction, direct electron excitation, and photon-induced lattice vibrations to demonstrate conducting elements of flexible LEDs and solar cells.54,55,57–63 In addition, LMI methods (e.g., laser lift-off (LLO)) have been widely used to transfer inorganic active layers onto plastic substrates through photothermally-induced interface decomposition, allowing preceding high temperature annealing for excellent performance of photonic components and energy harvesters.22,23,49,52,64–74 Recently, transient photoreactions such as interfacial atomic rearrangement or chemical reactions and metastable phase formation in nanomaterials have been exploited in unprecedented LMIs for a self-sustainable optoelectronic system.56,75–79 Shin et al. reported flash-induced physicochemical interlocking to demonstrate Cu-based robust micro light-emitting diodes (μLEDs) with outstanding output power, which were hardly attainable by conventional technologies of system on glass displays due to an inherent lattice mismatch between Cu and glass.75
Here, we introduce the representative LMI technologies and their applications for realizing a self-powered wearable optoelectronic system, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. We present the LMI methods including nanowelding, LLO, physical interlocking, and interfacial chemistry that can demonstrate inorganic materials with outstanding electrical/optical properties in heat-sensitive plastic substrates. The working mechanism of these novel approaches is thoroughly clarified on the basis of theoretical simulations and scientific results in relevant previous studies. Subsequently, we discuss various LMI-based flexible energy harvesters and optoelectronic devices such as piezoelectric nanogenerators, thermoelectric generators, and μLEDs. These perspectives will provide an outlook and innovative strategies to resolve the inherent thermal incompatibility and process complexity of inorganic materials for commercialization of high-performance self-powered flexible optoelectronics.

2. Light-material interface technologies
2.1 Nanowelding of metallic nanomaterials
LMI techniques have a unique ability to initiate photothermally-induced chemical dissociation and instantaneous atomic mass transport for material interface tuning via various light-induced processes including nanowelding and photonic sintering.59,80–97 These novel light-material interactions can demonstrate highly conductive nanomaterial electrodes for flexible energy harvesters and photonic devices by significantly expanding the current path of metallic networks without damaging plastic substrates.59,63 Garnett et al. introduced flash-induced plasmonic nanowelding at a NW junction interface to assemble AgNWs into a large conductive network for flexible electrodes of solar cells and LEDs.59Fig. 2a shows the AgNW network assembled by plasmonic welding of nanojunctions without thermal damage of the metallic nanostructures under transient light illumination of a tungsten halogen flash lamp. The flash-treated AgNW conductor exhibited an extremely low four-point resistance of 10 Ω compared to that of the pristine AgNWs, which was attributed to the remarkable current path expansion in metallic networks via interfacial nanowelding. Han et al. reported laser-induced nanowelding of CuNWs on polymer substrates via intensive plasmonic heating of NW interfaces to demonstrate a flexible transparent electrode.55 The Cu percolation networks were densely sintered without thermal oxidation or substrate damage due to selective annealing with a 532 nm wavelength laser at the boundary between metallic nanostructures, exhibiting a low sheet resistance of 37 Ω sq−1 after 20000 bending cycles, as shown in Fig. 2b. Park et al. implemented flash-activated plasmonic welding of AgNW junctions on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate for developing a highly conductive electrode for flexible piezoelectric nanogenerators.58 The flash light was electromagnetically coupled with delocalized electrons at the NW junctions, and generated intensive heat at the nanoscale interface of Ag nanostructures via gap plasmon formation, as displayed in Fig. 2c. The flash-activated interfacial heating caused strong interconnection of AgNWs without lattice defects in metallic nanostructures and heat shrinkage/expansion of a PET substrate, as presented in Fig. 2d. Fig. 2e shows that the electrical resistance of the AgNW conductor significantly decreased from 120 to 19 Ω sq−1 after transient light irradiation because of the flash-induced current path expansion in the AgNW networks. An overview of recent progress in nanowelding for developing flexible transparent conductive electrodes is provided in Table 1.

2.2 Laser lift-off and interlocking
LMI technologies (e.g., LLO and flash-induced lift-off) have been utilized to selectively transfer inorganic-based self-powered optoelectronic components including piezoelectric nanogenerators, LEDs, and thin-film transistors (TFTs) from rigid mother substrates to flexible plastics.22,23,52,64–74,98 As transient light is focused on the optically reactive interlayer between an active device and a transparent mother substrate, incident photons generate various photothermal reactions such as photonic dissociation, gas release, phase transformation, and instantaneous melting/vaporizing.34,51 Sequentially, the interfacial adhesion of various active materials including piezoelectric ceramics, LED epitaxy, and amorphous oxide semiconductors is significantly reduced, leading to selective exfoliation of active layers for a self-sustainable optoelectronic SoP. Lee et al. introduced a LLO method to transfer transparent and skin-like oxide TFT arrays on an ultrathin PET substrate with a thickness of 4 μm.67Fig. 3a shows the simulated temperature distribution of an indium zinc oxide (IZO) TFT on a mother glass substrate during XeCl laser irradiation. When the laser was irradiated onto the hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) layer between TFT arrays and the mother substrate, the temperature of the interface between a-Si:H and a buffer oxide layer increased above the Si melting point. Subsequently, intensive interfacial heat was spread along the direction of the glass substrate and the active device layer, however the TFTs were not thermally damaged due to the 1 μm thick buffer oxide, as presented in Fig. 3b. The photothermally heated a-Si:H released explosive hydrogen gas and formed crystalline Si agglomerates, deteriorating the adhesion between the laser-active layer and the glass substrate for selective TFT array exfoliation, as demonstrated in Fig. 3c.

The interfacial bonding strength between inorganic materials and substrates is a critical issue for self-powered optoelectronic devices to maintain their outstanding electrical/optical performance regardless of mechanical, thermal, and chemical stresses.2,22,75,99,100 In this regard, LMIs provide a practical solution to improve the interfacial adhesion of active components due to their capability to enable atomic rearrangement via instantaneous softening, interlocking, and nano-embedding.57,61,101–105 These interlocked or embedded interface structures can significantly increase the contact area, adhesion, and fracture energy of materials on the substrates, preventing serious structural damage of a self-sustainable optoelectronic system in spite of excessive heat, tensile/compressive strain, and moisture infiltration. Park et al. introduced flash-induced nanoscale interlocking of a photo-reduced Cu conductor and a PDMS substrate for the realization of a mechanically reliable Cu electrode.79 Under a single pulse of millisecond flash light, nanoscale interlocking was generated by the transient melting and solidification of the interface between a photo-sintered Cu conductor and a polymer substrate, as presented in Fig. 3d. The flash-activated stretchable Cu conductor exhibited consistent electrical resistance within a harsh tensile strain of 26.6% due to its interlocked structure, whereas the sputtered Cu experienced serious conductivity degradation at 7.5% strain. Ding et al. reported flash-induced CuNW embedding in a polyurethane (PU) substrate to fabricate a robust stretchable Cu conductor at room temperature in an air environment.106 During ultrafast one-step photonic sintering of a flash lamp, intensive photothermal heat was focused at the CuNW/PU interface, leading to instantaneous polymer softening and Cu nano-embedding into the substrate, as demonstrated in Fig. 3e. The flash-activated stretchable Cu conductor exhibited outstanding mechanical robustness without serious degradation of the electrical resistance after 100 bending cycles, which was attributed to the strong bonding between CuNWs and the PU substrate. Zhong et al. introduced physical embedding of CuNWs in a polycarbonate (PC) substrate via intense pulsed light (IPL) irradiation for the patterning of flexible transparent conductive electrodes.107Fig. 3f shows that the metallic NWs in the flash irradiated region strongly adhered to the substrate by the interfacial photothermal interactions between CuNW percolation networks and the flexible PC. The flash-treated CuNWs maintained their strong connection with the polymer substrate regardless of harsh chemical cleaning, whereas the pristine NWs were easily removed due to the absence of an interlocked structure. Based on this difference in adhesion between the IPL-irradiated NWs and the non-irradiated NWs, the CuNW film was patterned with high resolution by roll based wiping equipment, demonstrating continuous production of low-cost flexible Cu electrodes, as presented in Fig. 3g. Recently, LMIs have provided an effective route to improve adhesion between inorganic active components and substrates by accomplishing unprecedented interfacial chemistry, which is extremely difficult to achieve by conventional complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) and μLED technologies.75,108–110 In 2021, Shin et al. reported flash-induced chemical interlocking between a photo-reduced Cu conductor and a glass substrate to demonstrate a robust μLED electrode in spite of poor Cu adhesion on glass.75 During flash illumination, intensive interfacial heating led to a chemically interlocked structure via the formation of a 10 μm thick Cu2O interfacial layer that resolved the weak adhesion between the photo-sintered Cu and the substrate, as shown in Fig. 3h. The flash-activated durable Cu electrode with a low resistivity of 5.6 μΩ cm presented outstanding adhesion energy, which was five times higher than that of a vacuum deposited Cu film, and facilitated the stable operation of a thin-film μLED under harsh thermal stress and moisture infiltration.
3. Self-powered optoelectronic applications
3.1 Flexible energy harvesters
Flexible piezoelectric energy harvesters have attracted a great deal of attention from researchers for self-powered wearable optoelectronics due to their advantage of producing energy from waste mechanical resources including pressure, bending, and vibration. However, the high temperature sintering of active materials (e.g., PZT and Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 (PMN-PT)) seriously damages heat-sensitive plastic substrates.22,64,65,111–120 To resolve this challenging thermal issue, the LLO process has been recently utilized, which enables piezoelectric materials to be densely sintered via conventional high temperature annealing and subsequently transferred onto plastic substrates.23,66,70–72,74 Park et al. reported a highly efficient flexible PZT nanogenerator on a PET substrate using the LLO process.23 Sol–gel PZT annealed at a high temperature of 650 °C was selectively exfoliated from a mother substrate via intensive XeCl laser irradiation at the boundary between a piezoelectric ceramic and transparent sapphire, and transferred onto a plastic substrate by using a UV curable adhesive. Fig. 4a shows a 3.5 cm × 3.5 cm sized flexible PZT energy harvesting device conformally attached to a curved glass tube with a radius of 1.5 cm. Under repetitive bending and unbending of a human finger, the large-area nanogenerator produced an electrical current of ∼8.7 μA, which was high enough to simultaneously turn on 105 commercial blue LED arrays aligned in a series, as presented in Fig. 4b. Fig. 4c displays a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) type transparent energy harvester that was fabricated by transferring indium-tin-oxide (ITO) deposited PZT from a sapphire substrate to an ITO-coated PET substrate via the LMI technique.121 During a repetitive tensile and compressive strain of 0.12% at 1.2 Hz frequency, the energy harvesting device exhibited a maximum output voltage, current, and average electrical power of 0.28 V, 30 nA, and 8.4 nW cm−2, respectively. Hwang et al. introduced a highly efficient piezoelectric nanogenerator consisting of a 7 μm thick polycrystalline PZT film and a PET substrate.70 High quality PZT formed by aerosol deposition (AD) was successfully transferred from a rigid mother substrate to a plastic substrate by the LLO process without serious lattice defects or electrical property degradation. The AD PZT harvester generated an open-circuit voltage and a short circuit current of 75 V and 14 μA, respectively, by regular bending and unbending motions with a curvature radius of 21 mm, a tensile strain of 0.3%, a strain rate of 2.2% s−1, and a frequency of 0.4 Hz, as presented in Fig. 4d. Fig. 4e shows the integration of a piezoelectric energy harvester and a relaxor ferromagnetic (RFE) capacitor on a flexible substrate to develop a self-charging, ultrafast, and high-power density (SUHP) capacitor system.65 AD-processed PZT and PMN-PT films were simultaneously transferred onto a single plastic substrate via laser-induced interface vaporization between the transparent sapphire substrates and the ceramic materials. The flexible SUHP capacitor system piezoelectrically produced an output energy of ∼1.4 mJ cm−3 under a repetitive bending force of 1 N and a load resistance of 10 MΩ, and instantly stored the generated power, thus demonstrating significant potential as a sustainable power source. Meanwhile, flexible thermoelectric generators (TEGs), a promising energy source for self-powered optoelectronic devices by converting heat into electrical power, have been fabricated by the LLO process.122 Lee et al. utilized the LLO process to exfoliate a PDMS encapsulated thermoelectric layer consisting of p-type Bi0.3Sb1.7Te3 and n-type Bi2Se0.3Te2.7 from a SiO2/a-Si/quartz wafer, and demonstrated a freestanding flexible TEG, as presented in Fig. 4f.69 A flexible TEG with 72 thermoelectric units generated a high electrical power of 4.78 mW cm−2 at a temperature gradient of 25 °C, and exhibited a constant internal resistance despite 8000 bending cycles at a curvature radius of 30 mm.

3.2 μLEDs
μLEDs are promising candidates for self-powered optoelectronics due to their outstanding power efficiency and fast response time, however, they require strong bonding on substrates to be stably operated without serious performance degradation under harsh environmental stresses (e.g., heat, moisture, and chemicals).123–140 In this regard, Shin et al. developed light-induced physicochemical interlocking to provide a practical solution for increasing the interfacial adhesion energy of μLED components.75Fig. 5a illustrates a flash-activated durable Cu electrode on a glass substrate and its interconnection with AlGaInP vertical thin-film μLEDs (VLEDs) via an anisotropic conductive film (ACF) bonding process. During photo-chemical reduction of CuO NPs to a Cu conductor, intensive heating at the CuO/glass interface chemically formed an ultrathin Cu2O interlayer to resolve the intrinsic lattice mismatch between copper and the display substrate. Furthermore, physical interlocking of the Cu/glass boundary was initiated via photothermally induced instantaneous glass softening and solidification to significantly increase the interfacial adhesion energy of a display electrode. AlGaInP VLEDs were electrically interconnected to a flash-activated robust Cu conductor by an ACF, and stably operated under extreme thermal stress and moisture infiltration. Fig. 5b shows the optical power density of VLEDs on a flash-induced Cu electrode and a vacuum-deposited Cu thin film as a function of injection current. The red thin-film μLED on the flash-activated Cu conductor exhibited 35% higher optical power density than a LED on vacuum-deposited Cu at a current of 1200 mA mm−2, which could be attributed to the LMI-strengthened electrode robustness. The electrical/optical properties of AlGaInP VLEDs on photo-sintered Cu and sputtered Cu were measured under harsh environmental stresses of temperature and humidity to investigate the μLED stability improvement by flash-induced interfacial interlocking. Fig. 5c presents the forward voltage change of VLEDs during a temperature humidity storage test at 85 °C/85% relative humidity. The μLED transferred onto the flash-induced Cu electrode exhibited consistent electrical performance until 48 hours of the test, whereas the VLED on the vacuum deposited Cu experienced a drastic voltage increase after 6 hours of heat and moisture infiltration. In addition, the AlGaInP μLED integrated with LMI-processed Cu showed superior stability to a μLED interconnected with the sputtered Cu in terms of relative optical power. During the thermal shock test performed at a temperature gradient of 150 °C, the VLED on the flash-induced Cu conductor maintained its initial forward bias and optical power after 150 cycles of repetitive heating and cooling, as displayed in Fig. 5d. Fig. 5e shows the optical power distribution of 50 × 50 VLED arrays transferred onto the flash-activated Cu electrode at an injection current of 35 mA. The AlGaInP VLEDs exhibited a high illumination yield with little dark area, and uniform distribution of the forward voltage, light wavelength, and device temperature, demonstrating the feasibility of a flash-induced robust Cu conductor for thin-film μLED displays.

GaN μLEDs inevitably require metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) at a high temperature of over 550 °C, and therefore LMI methods have been utilized to transfer MOCVD grown epitaxial layers from a mother sapphire substrate onto a plastic substrate.49,52,141,142Fig. 6a illustrates the monolithic packaging of photochemically exfoliated GaN LED layers to realize high performance flexible blue VLED arrays.68 The epitaxial layers were entirely delaminated from a sapphire substrate by a KrF laser-based LLO, and pixelated as micro-sized chips, followed by AgNW-based vertical interconnection, biocompatible polymer passivation, and selective Cu foil wet etching. The flexible VLEDs with a high optical power density of 30 mW mm−2 were conformally attached onto a curved mold without serious mechanical failure, and stably operated with white light illumination via a phosphor-based color conversion layer, as presented in Fig. 6b. Furthermore, 84.1% of the 8 × 8 GaN LED arrays showed a uniform distribution of the forward voltage, which ranged from 2.5 to 2.7 V under 1 mA current injection.

Numerous researchers have attempted to operate high performance flexible μLEDs by integrating energy harvesting devices for the realization of a LMI-based self-powered optoelectronic system.4,22 Jeong et al. demonstrated a self-powered flexible light-emitting system consisting of AlGaInP VLEDs and a highly efficient piezoelectric nanogenerator on plastic substrates, as shown in Fig. 6c.22 The AlGaInP μLED chips and a thermally sintered piezoelectric film were successfully transferred onto flexible substrates by thermo-compression and the LLO process, respectively, and presented consistent electrical/optical properties regardless of repetitive bending/unbending cycles. Furthermore, 3 × 3 VLED arrays generated a pulsed red light on a plastic rod with a radius of 5 mm, resulting from ∼10 μA AC current and 140 V output voltage of the flexible energy harvester under finger flicking. Fig. 6d illustrates self-powered optogenetic neuromodulation of flexible AlGaInP VLEDs enabled by a flash-enhanced magnet-mechano-triboelectric nanogenerator (MMTENG).4 The nanoscale interlocking of the CuO/Nylon interface dramatically increased the contact area of the MMTENG, leading to a high open-circuit voltage of 134 V that was converted into an input power of 0.4 mW for VLED operation. During the energy harvesting of the MMTENG, the AlGaInP VLEDs stably irradiated a red light with an optical power density of 2.14 mW mm−2, which was high enough for optogenetic stimulation of Chrimson-expressed neurons in the primary cortex to control mouse whisker movement.
4. Conclusions
LMI technologies have provided versatile routes to realize self-powered wearable optoelectronic systems via various interfacial photon interactions that are characterized as follows: (i) nanowelding enables effective electrical interconnection of nanomaterials without damaging underlying plastic substrates by simple pulsed light irradiation instead of time-consuming and energy inefficient furnace annealing. For example, millisecond flash light incident on one-dimensional NWs initiates self-limited plasmonic welding of nanojunctions, and significantly expands the current path in metallic networks while maintaining high transparency to demonstrate flexible transparent conductive electrodes of optoelectronic devices. (ii) LLO allows the implementation of the well-established CMOS process of inorganic materials for fabricating flexible energy harvesting and photonic devices by selective exfoliation of active layers from rigid substrates via photothermally-activated interface decomposition. (iii) Light-induced physical interlocking of a multi-material interface facilitates robust operation of a self-powered flexible optoelectronic system by strengthening the adhesion between device components and substrates. This LMI technique has advanced to the level of controlling the interfacial chemistry to overcome inherent material properties related to adhesion, which cannot be accomplished by traditional μLED and Si chip technologies.
Despite substantial research on LMIs for self-sustainable flexible optoelectronics, several issues should be resolved for commercialization and scientific progress. For instance, most LMI studies have focused on performance enhancement without considering the practical correlation between processing parameters and interfacial photoreactions. Although several researchers have investigated LMI mechanisms via photothermal simulations and in situ characterization studies, in-depth theoretical models based on feedback experiments should be further established to minimize trial and errors for optimizing processing conditions. In addition, extensive research in the field of nanomaterial synthesis is required to develop uniform nanostructures, and extend the scope of LMI materials for reliable and effective photothermal treatment. Advances in material deposition techniques are necessary to develop a high yield mass-production system based on LMIs. Lastly, the resolution of LMI technologies should be improved to demonstrate miniaturized and highly integrated optoelectronic and energy harvesting devices on plastic substrates. We believe that LMIs will become significant for self-powered wearable optoelectronics, overcoming the aforementioned challenges through multidisciplinary collaboration in the fields of materials science, physics, and chemistry.
