    , Accepted 23rd November 2016First published on 12th December 2016AbstractIn this paper, foldable polymer solar cells (PSCs) were fabricated on woven fabrics by a free-standing, wet transfer method. A new concept of ‘water-borne PSCs’ was proposed to show the ultra-stability of organic photoactive materials under extremely humid conditions and even in water. There were a series of particular designs in the fabrication process: (1) flexible conductive woven fabrics were fabricated by polymer-assisted metal deposition; (2) a free-standing, wet transfer method was applied to laminate an active layer and a top electrode onto the as-prepared fabric electrodes simultaneously; (3) an interface modification layer was formed by diffusing a dilute polymer solution through fibers. The best device performances were achieved for the PSC on fabric A with a power conversion efficiency almost equal to those of the conventional devices using the same active materials, which would enrich wearable electronics by utilizing more comfortable and flexible un-modified woven fabrics.
1. Introduction
Various kinds of solar cells have emerged to satisfy the rapidly increasing energy consumption around the world. For single-junction silicon or GaAs-based solar cells, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of around 30% have been reported.1,2 As a new generation of energy conversion technology, inorganic–organic metal hybrid perovskite solar cells are booming and present the highest PCE over 20%.3,4 Competing with these high efficiency solar cells, organic solar cells especially polymer solar cells (PSCs) should take advantage of their flexibility, light weight, large area, low-cost process and wide adaptability to various substrates.5–12 Fortunately, these merits give infinite possibilities to PSCs for use as wearable power generation devices, which perfectly meet the potential application in the military, where soldiers need electricity for portable devices in remote areas,13 and also in the individual needs on portable wearable devices.14
As for wearable electronics, only being flexible is not enough but being foldable is also needed. The preferred foldable electronic carriers are textiles and garment materials of humans, and wearable devices on textiles will be more adaptable to our living. Fiber, yarn, thread, woven and non-woven fabric are all included in the category of textiles, which result in a big wearable electronics family.15–19 Fiber or yarn based PSCs attract intense attention first,20–23 while long linear conductors would bring high energy consumption and power leakage. Without gaps formed by weaving, non-woven polypropylene textile tapes can be used as conventional substrates of organic solar cells as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or polyimide (PI) sheets.24 Compared with non-woven fabrics, woven fabrics are more compatible with our clothing and give a more comfortable feeling. However, it is difficult to obtain a uniform thin film with the thickness of several to hundreds of nanometers on woven fabrics by using common film formation methods such as vacuum deposition, coating and printing due to their high roughness and breathability. To address this issue, Krebs25 smoothed the surface of a woven fabric by laminating a polyethylene film and S. Arumugam26 screened a printable polyurethane based interface paste on a woven fabric; both studies filled and leveled up the gaps of woven fabrics to a certain degree. Fabric electrodes can also be laminated on other parts of PSCs which have been prepared on a conventional substrate;27,28 the resulting devices with double substrates would lose the flexibility of fabrics. A thick TiO2 electron transporting layer can fill up the interspaces of fabrics, which would be confined to TiO2 based devices.29 Moreover, a thick inorganic film with a high Young's modulus can restrict the flexibility of fabrics.
It is obviously a big challenge to construct PSCs, in which the thicknesses of the functional layers are from several nanometers to hundreds of nanometers, on the woven fabric comprising micrometer patterns and gaps. Herein, we design new methods to prepare PSCs on woven fabrics, rather than change woven fabrics into a commonly used substrate. First, silver electrodes are directly deposited on a woven fabric by a polymer assisted metal deposition (PAMD) method in electroless deposition (ELD) solution, and the thin metal film will not change the textile texture of the woven fabric.30–35 Then, a wet transfer method is used for transferring the free-standing active layer and top electrode onto the woven fabric electrode in water together. Finally, interface modification layer (IML) between the woven fabric electrode and active layer is obtained by the diffusion of the dilute solution of the interface modification material. Active areas of the novel PSCs are studied by differentiating colors of contact areas and non-contact areas. A maximum PCE of 2.90% is achieved from the PSCs on fabric A. Besides this proof-of-concept work on PSCs, the huge substrate adaptability of polymer films is also demonstrated, which casts light on the application of polymer functional layers into diverse devices.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Woven fabrics were supplied by textile companies. Two kinds of woven fabrics with different textile textures were used as the substrates for preparing Ag electrodes. One was fabric A made of PET, and the other was fabric B made of nylon. PH1000, a solution of highly conductive poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), was purchased from Heraeus Clevios. Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) was purchased from Rieke Metals, Inc. 1-(3-Methoxycarbonyl)propyl-1-phenyl[6,6]C61 (PC61BM) was purchased from American Dye Source, Inc. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) (Mw = 4000) and potassium peroxodisulfate (KPS) were purchased from Uni-Chem. Ammonium tetrachloropalladate(II) ((NH4)2PdCl4), [3-(methacryloyloxy)propyl] trimethoxysilane (MPS), 2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl-trimethylammonium chloride (METAC) (80 wt% aqueous solution), polyethylenimine (PEI), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
2.2 Methods

2.2.1 Fabrication of the fabric Ag electrode by PAMD. 
Woven fabrics were first treated with oxygen plasma for 4 min or immersed in concentrated NaOH (1 M) for 10 min, and then immersed into a 0.5 wt% MPS solution (solvent: 95% EtOH, 1% HAc) for 1 h. After that, MPS-coated fabrics were immersed into an aqueous solution of METAC (20 wt%) and KPS (2.5 g L−1), and heated at 60 °C for 60 min for polymerization. Catalytic paste ((NH4)2PdCl4, (23 mg)), PEG (5 g, Mw = 4000 g mol−1) and deionised (DI) water (1.3 g)) were screen-printed onto the PMETAC-modified fabrics to form the ink patterns. Finally, the ink-patterned substrates were placed in the dark for 30 min to load PdCl42− by ion exchange, followed by treatment with plasma for 2 min and rinsing with DI water to remove the ink. The ELD of Ag was performed in a reducing agent consisting of a 1:1 mixture of freshly prepared solutions A and B. Solution A contains NaOH (12 g L−1) and potassium sodium tartrate (29 g L−1) in DI water. Solution B is a formaldehyde (45 mL L−1) aqueous solution. Then the activated PdCl42− loaded substrates were immersed in the Ag plating bath ([5 g L−1 Ag(NH3)2]NO3 and 50 g L−1 potassium sodium tartrate aqueous solution) for 2–10 min to achieve the printed Ag electrode.


2.2.2 Fabrication of PSCs. 
To obtain a free-standing active layer, a water-soluble sacrificial layer of PSSNa was spin-coated on silicon substrates first. The active layer of PSCs was then spin-coated on PSSNa at 800 rpm for 60 s in a glovebox from the chlorobenzene solution of P3HT:PC61BM (10:8 in weight ratio) and annealed at 145 °C for 5 min. Aqueous PEDOT:PSS PH1000 solution was mixed with 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 0.5% surfactant (Zonyl FS 300). Doped PH1000 was spin-coated on the active layer as top electrodes at 1000 rpm for 60 s, and then annealed at 120 °C for 20 min. The resulting silicon/PSSNa/active layer/PH1000 was put into water. After PSSNa dissolved in water, the active layer/PH1000 would separate from silicon substrates and transfer onto the woven fabric Ag electrode in water. A PEI IML was formed by the diffusion of its 0.1 wt% 2-methoxyethanol solution between the active layer and Ag electrode through fibers. Finally, the whole device was annealed at 120 °C for 20 min in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. Thus, the PSCs with a structure of woven fabric/Ag/PEI/P3HT:PC61BM (300 nm)/PH1000 (120 nm) were achieved.

2.3 Characterization
Optical images were recorded with a Nikon Eclipse 80i optical microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). A scanning electron microscope (TM3000, Hitachi and JEOL JSM-6700F) was used to check the cross-sectional images of the fabric based devices. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was performed by using an ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer. A Keithley 2400 source meter was used to measure the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cells, and a 300 W Oriel solar simulator (91160, Newport, 100 mW cm−2, equipped with an AM1.5 filter) calibrated by using a standard silicon solar cell was used as the light source. The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the devices were measured with a standard system equipped with a xenon lamp (Oriel 66902, 300 W), a monochromator (Newport 66902), a Si detector (Oriel 76175_71580) and a dual channel power meter (Newport 2931_C).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Study on the printable woven fabric Ag electrodes
The fabrication process of the PSCs on a woven fabric is shown in Scheme 1. Film formation methods of all functional layers were particularly designed according to the unique characteristics of the woven fabric. Woven fabrics are made of many threads woven on warps and wefts and a thread is formed by multi-strand fibers, which make woven fabrics soft, deformable, breathable and durable. The interlacing warp and weft threads illustrate the rough surface profile of the woven fabric with considerable gaps between fibers and threads. Here, a new kind of ELD method, the PAMD technique, was used for the preparation of fabric Ag electrodes. Unlike top-down fusion of nano/micro-sized metal particles in conventional printable metal inks, PAMD uses a bottom-up approach to grow dense metal layers at low temperature with the aid of a surface-grafted polymer. The superiority of the PAMD method over vacuum deposition in the preparation of an electrically conductive fabric is shown in Fig. 1. The huge resistance shown in Fig. 1b and d confirms that electrically conductive metal electrodes would not be obtained on woven fabrics through vacuum deposition, while the in situ grown silver atoms in the ELD bath solution can connect with each other in almost any irregular substrate, which is attributed to the growth mechanism of metal atoms in solution. Fabric Ag electrodes fabricated by PAMD and vacuum deposition were also checked by cross-sectional SEM (Fig. S1a and b†). We found that only a part of the fibers is covered with the Ag film by vacuum deposition due to the shadowing effect, and in the fabric electrodes fabricated by PAMD, the Ag film covered all the surface of the fibers. There were two kinds of woven fabrics with different textile textures to verify the universality of our method. Using four-probe measurements, fabric A presented a sheet resistance of 250 mΩ □−1 and fabric B presented a sheet resistance of 200 mΩ □−1 due to the different textures and surface quality of threads. Fabric A made of PET was woven by close-packed cylindrical threads, while threads knit into loose cross patterns in fabric B which was made of nylon (Fig. 2). Metal electrodes can be fabricated on plastic sheets, glass or textile by PAMD; the material and morphology of these substrates can affect the quality of the metal electrodes. So a higher conductive Ag electrode with bright metal luster formed on fabric B which is constituted by smoother threads (Fig. 2b).

3.2 Study on the wet-transfer method using free-standing polymeric thin films
Similarly, uniform active layers cannot be achieved on woven fabrics by the common solution process methods such as spin-coating and ink-jet due to the non-planar properties and rugged surface morphology on a scale of tens of micrometers. So we raise a new fabrication concept, ‘water-borne PSCs’, in which a wet transfer method was used to laminate the active layer onto the woven fabric electrode. In the dry transfer process, an upholder can give a support to the transferred film,36,37 but in this wet transfer process, a free-standing active layer is laminated on the fabric electrode in water. Compared with other solution processes such as spin-coating and ink-jet printing, the wet transfer method is much less sensitive to the morphology and materials of substrates. It is well known that most of the substrates can be stable in water. Generally, organic semiconductor films are thought to be very sensitive to water so that they are always protected from water instead of ‘be borne’ from water. In this work, the strong water tolerance of polymeric active layers is demonstrated, which is not possible for their high water sensitive perovskite counterparts. Organic materials are not as sensitive to water as they were thought to be. Many organic materials are synthesized with water added in the reaction system. Most organic compounds cannot react with water and some organic compounds can react with water at high temperature or under the stimulation of light. Only the organic compounds containing highly active functional groups can react with water easily. Similarly, some organic active materials used in optoelectronic devices are also very stable in water.38,39 Polymer based active layers of PSCs possess high compactness and toughness, which ensure that they can keep integrity after they are separated from the substrates.40 Meanwhile, they can float on the water surface due to their hydrophobic properties. The most commonly used polymer donor, P3HT blend with an acceptor, PC61BM, formed the bulk heterojunction active layer. Owing to the high molecular weight and intermolecular force of P3HT, P3HT:PC61BM can be transferred in water with a thickness as low as 50 nm. But a 300 nm active layer is used by us for the high light absorption. The whole wet transfer process over time is shown in Fig. S2.† In this work, due to their hydrophobic properties, P3HT:PCBM keeps floating on the surface of water, only the lower surface of P3HT:PCBM can contact water. Also because of the hydrophobic properties, water molecules cannot permeate into the active layer. 120 nm PH1000 spin-coated on P3HT:PC61BM served as the top transparent anode, which typically has a high optical transmittance of over 85% and an electrical conductivity of about 103 S cm. The bi-layer wet transfer of the active layer and top electrode simultaneously could ensure an ohmic contact between the active layer and the anode, and also avoid negative effects from the double transfer. Moreover, the bottom P3HT:PC61BM can give an effective protection to the hydrophilic PH1000 during the wet transfer. During the bi-layer wet-transfer, PH1000 is on top of the active layer and will not come into contact with water at all.
3.3 Study on the PEI IML of PSCs obtained by a diffusion method
IMLs of the PSCs are very important for a high PCE achievement.41–43 The work function (WF) of the fabric Ag electrode is around 4.5 eV, which mismatches with the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of acceptor PC61BM (LUMO = 4.2 eV), resulting in an electrical barrier to prevent electron extraction from the acceptor to the cathode. Moreover, the gap (0.5 eV) between WFs of Ag and PH1000 is not big enough for the effective exciton dissociation, which will lead to a low Voc. Thus, an IML between the Ag electrode and active layer is needed. IMLs of the PSCs are always within 50 nm due to their low electrical conductivities. It is also a big challenge to prepare thin IMLs on the woven fabric electrodes. To solve this problem, a thin and uniform IML on the woven fabric electrode was prepared by a very simple and ingenious method, in which the diffusion of PEI dilute solution through fibers was utilized for obtaining an ultra-thin PEI film after solvent evaporation. This was attributed to both the physisorption ability of aliphatic amine groups from PEI44 and the high diffusibility of woven fabric. After the surface modification by PEI, the WF of the Ag electrode decreased to 3.6 ± 0.2 eV, which was confirmed by UPS analysis (Fig. 4a). Moreover, as an efficient surfactant, the adhesive force between the active layer and woven fabric electrode can be enhanced by aliphatic amine groups of PEI, which would be beneficial to form an ohmic contact between them. To obtain IMLs by diffusing a dilute solution, the substrate materials should not be dissolved or swelled by the solvent of the dilute solution, which is the same as other solution technologies.
For the “water-borne PSCs”, annealing of the whole device in a N2 glovebox over 100 °C is quite necessary according to the following three aspects: (1) annealing is helpful to realize good ohmic contacts between the adjacent functional layers; (2) the electrical conductivity of PH1000 will be improved by annealing, which is helpful for decreasing the series resistance of PSCs; (3) annealing can reduce the content of water and oxygen inside a device.
3.4 Photovoltaic performance
To study device performances of the PSCs on woven fabrics, active areas of the devices should be checked first. In this work, active areas of the PSCs are from 4.0 mm2 to 10.0 mm2, which are close to those of the PSCs fabricated on the conventional planar substrates such as glass and PET. The main size restriction of this technology is the uniformity of the printed electrode on woven fabrics and the sheet resistance of doped PH1000, which are also problems for the PSCs fabricated on planar substrates. The active area of a solar cell is the light power conversion area, in which the active layer comes into contact with both the anode and cathode. For the conventional planar PSCs, the active area is equal to the overlap area of the cathode and anode, while in textile-based PSCs, the curved surface of threads brings difficulty to determine the real active area. The cross-section of the PSCs on fabric A was studied by SEM (Fig. 3a). Different from the device with the textile electrode laminating flat parts of the PSCs containing ITO glass,27 flexible free-standing polymer films can come into contact with a part of the convex place of fabric electrodes, and the contact areas are separated by non-contact areas full of air. But due to inhomogeneous fibers and geometrical joints of the woven fabrics, the real active layer cannot be calculated easily. Fortunately, because of the high reflectance of bottom Ag electrodes, the color of the contact area is different from that of the non-contact area, which is displayed clearly in the top optical images of the devices. Therefore, we used an approximate but effective method to determine active areas of the PSCs by differentiating colors from the microscope images.45 A higher ratio of the active area to the overlap area of two electrodes was shown in the close-packed fabric A, and the ratios around 50% and 20% were obtained from two best performance devices based on fabric A and fabric B respectively (Fig. 2c and d), according to a digital photo processing program.
 Fig. 3  (a) Cross-sectional SEM images of the PSC fabricated on fabric A and (b) schematic diagram of a part of PSC on fabric A. 
In view of the real active area, the PSC on fabric A presented a PCE of 2.90% with a Voc of 0.58 V, a FF of 0.41 and a Jsc of 12.10 mA cm−2, which is close to the photovoltaic performances from a conventional device (Fig. 4b). 0.58 V is a normal Voc of the P3HT:PC61BM based solar cells, which demonstrates that the diffusion of PEI solution through fibers is an effective method to form an IML on the fabric electrode. The distribution of the PCEs from 20 devices on fabric A is shown in Fig. S3,† which shows an average PCE of around 2.50% from the PSCs on fabric A. The best device on fabric B presented a PCE of 1.85% with a Voc of 0.46 V, an FF of 0.29 and a Jsc of 13.58 mA cm−2. A Voc of 0.46 V indicates that the PEI IML between the active layer and fabric B electrode is not fully covered or thick enough to block the hole injection to the cathode. In the process of PEI diffusion, there may be less quantity of PEI retained in the smooth curve surface of fabric B than that in the rough curve surface of fabric A. It is noted that 300 nm P3HT:PC61BM will bring a higher Jsc and a lower FF to the PSCs, and a part of Jsc of the devices may come from the light scattering of the curved fabric electrode. The FF of 0.41 achieved from the PSCs on fabric A is very promising for the devices with such rugged electrode profiles, which will cast light on the application of the free-standing transfer method in organic electronics.

(b) J–V characteristics of the PSCs on a woven fabric under AM 1.5 illumination (inset: dark J–V characteristics of the PSCs on fabric A). (c) EQE spectra of the PSCs on a woven fabric. (d) Performance degradation of the PSCs on fabric A in the folding test. 
Good diode characteristics with low leakage current and high rectification ratio are clearly shown in the dark J–V curve of the PSC on fabric A. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the PSCs based on fabric electrodes are shown in Fig. 4c. The diffraction of the curved surface metal electrodes resulted in relatively flat photocurrent response profiles at different wavelengths. Because fabric-based devices are potential wearable technologies, we also checked the flexibility of the PSCs on fabric A. Due to the low Young's modulus of woven fabrics, devices can be folded in half easily, which simplifies the bending test compared to the folding test. The degradation of device performances can be seen in Fig. 4d; a slightly decreased PCE appeared within 6 folding cycles and PCE dropped in half after 10 folding cycles. The PSCs fabricated on most flexible substrates can not be folded over, which will lead to an unrecoverable deformation of the substrates. While woven fabrics have the unique advantage for foldable devices. Although the fabric based PSCs is foldable enough to be bended by 180°, the stability of the device upon folding needs to be improved in the future. Here, the PSCs were not encapsulated and the photovoltaic performances were obtained in air. We believe that the stability of PSCs can be improved further by using appropriate encapsulation layers. Washability is another merit of this kind of PSC; devices can be washed with water and used again by diffusion of PEI dilute solution and annealing in a nitrogen-filled glovebox.
4. Conclusion
We have demonstrated the first example of comfortable, foldable and washable PSCs on woven fabric electrodes by a free-standing, wet transfer method, and a very attractive new concept of ‘water-borne PSCs’. Two kinds of woven fabrics were used to display the feasibility of our method, the PSCs on packed fabric A presented a PCE of 2.90% with a Voc of 0.58 V, a FF of 0.41 and a Jsc of 12.10 mA cm−2, which is a wonderful photovoltaic efficiency achieved from the PSCs on un-modified woven fabrics. There are two valuable clues on the integration of several to hundreds of nanometers thick functional layers with micro-meter patterned substrates: one is the wet transfer method used to laminate polymer films onto irregular substrates and the other is to utilize the diffusion method to form thin functional layers.
