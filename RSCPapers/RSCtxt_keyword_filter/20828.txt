    , Accepted 11th May 2015First published on 13th May 2015AbstractPerovskite solar cells have attracted increasing interest among the photovoltaic community in the last few years owing to their unique properties and high efficiency. In the present work, we report the fabrication of perovskite solar cells based on highly ordered 1-dimensional porous TiO2 photoanodes, which are uniform on a large area. These nanocolumnar porous TiO2 photoanodes were deposited by physical vapor deposition in an oblique angle configuration (PVD-OAD) by varying the zenithal angle between the target and the substrate normal. Perovskite infiltration into these 1-dimensional nanocolumnar structures was homogeneous through the entire thickness of the porous layer as revealed by secondary ion mass spectroscopy studies. The fabricated solar cells, with an optimized thickness of the photoanode and with industrially accepted methods, will pave the way for easy implementation on a large scale.
A Introduction
Perovskite based solar cells have attracted a surge of attention in a very short time frame owing to their remarkable power-conversion efficiency (PCE) which can match those of well-established and mature technologies.1–4 The light harvesting ability of these devices has positioned them as a strong competitor within the thin film category of solar cells with the PCE approaching 20% in laboratory.5,6 The versatility of perovskite deposition, by wet chemistry,1,3,5,6 vapor deposition7 or the mixed process comprising the solution process for the inorganic precursor followed by vapor assisted deposition of the organic component,8 makes it attractive for the manufacture of a large variety of cell architectures. These deposition methods have proved to be compatible with different photoanode materials like the most extended TiO2,3,5,6,9 ZnO10,11 or even mesoporous scaffolds made of electron non-injecting oxides like Al2O3 (ref. 2 and 12) or ZrO2.13 Classical hole transporting materials (HTMs), Spiro-OMeTAD,1–3,6 as well as other polymeric,5,14 organic15,16 and inorganic17 materials were found suitable for efficient device fabrication, though the use of HTMs is not mandatory.9 The high open-circuit potential in these devices is due to their low thermodynamic losses. Thus, for a bandgap of 1.57 eV (CH3NH3PbI3),18VOC values of 1.2 V can be achieved, mainly due to the low recombination rate characteristic of these systems.19,20
In the past, the application of vertically-aligned nanostructures (nanocolumns, nanorods, and nanowires) was found to be effective for enhancing the electron transport properties of different types of solar cells including silicon,21 III–V semiconductors,22 organic photovoltaic devices23 and dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).24–26 In addition, the idea of using these nanostructured nanocolumnar thin films is not only justified by the expected improvement of the transport properties along the nanocolumns, but also because of the fact that as low-refractive index materials they can minimize the reflection of light, thereby enhancing the amount of absorbed light and can increase the efficiency of the solar cell. The fabrication of nanostructured columnar thin films has been intended by different techniques, including the physical deposition method at oblique angles.27,28 In DSSCs this technique was found to be effective for increasing the amount of the absorbed dyes to harvest light and to improve the transport properties and carrier lifetime; all these features lead to the improvement in photogenerated current with respect to equivalent mesoporous nanoparticle cells.27,29 Based on this concept, herein we have produced TiO2 aligned nanocolumnar photoanodes by the physical vapor deposition method at oblique incidence angles (PVD-OAD) and used them for the fabrication of CH3NH3PbI3 based solar cells. To further tune and optimize the system, the influence of different morphological parameters such as porosity, thickness and angle arrangement of the nanocolumnar layers was investigated to check their influence on the photovoltaic performance magnitudes such as short circuit current (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF) and PCE.
It is important to remark that uniform and large area 1-directional nanocolumnar photoanodes can be easily prepared using this PVD technique, which is critical for future scale up of the technology. To visualize the degree of infiltration of the perovskites in the pores of the film, Time of flight-secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) was used to analyze the perovskite distribution along the photoanode thickness. It has been found that the adequate infiltration of the perovskite inside the nanocolumnar film is critical condition for the fabrication of these structures and that it can be moderately tuned by varying the porosity of the film by changing the zenithal incidence angle (α) of the evaporated flux of TiO2 onto the substrate.
In the past30–32 nanocolumnar and nanowire TiO2 based photoanodes (thickness 500–1500 nm) were utilized for perovskite solar cell fabrication and thinner films were found to be effective for device fabrication; similar to this we found that TiO2 photoanodes (between 200 and 300 nm) are even more efficient to collect the photons and, likely because of their particular tilted microstructure,28 show high JSC values (>16 mA cm−2 for 200 nm and even >18 mA cm−2 for the 300 nm thick one) in combination with a very high VOC of 949.8 mV and fill factor (∼0.64); the consequence of good transport of charge along the nanocolumns gave PCEs of 10.52%.
B Experimental
Materials
All chemicals were commercially bought from either Sigma Aldrich or Agros and were employed without any treatment or purification. 2,2′,7,7′-Tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) was acquired from Merck KGaA. Poly-triarylamine (PTAA) was acquired from EM-index (Mw = 17500 g mol−1). Methylamine iodide, CH3NH3I (MAI), was synthetized according the known literature.33
Preparation of TiO2 tilted nanocolumnar films
NC-TiO2 anatase used as an electron transporting porous film with a thickness of 100 to 500 nm was prepared at room temperature by physical vapor deposition at oblique incidence (PVD-OAD) using a procedure reported in previous studies.27–29 Basically, this method consists of physical vapor deposition where the substrate surface is placed forming a glancing angle with respect to the evaporation source. A zenithal evaporation angle (α) is defined as the angle between the normal to the substrate and the flux of the evaporation material as illustrated in Fig. 1a. By varying the mentioned zenithal angle, the tilting angle of the nanocolumns can be tuned, as well as the porosity and other properties of the films.28

Device fabrication
First, FTO-coated glass, TEC15 from Pilkington, was patterned by laser etching. Then, the substrates were cleaned using Hellmanex solution and rinsed11,19 with deionized water and ethanol; subsequently they were ultrasonicated in 2-propanol and rinsed again using ethanol and acetone and finally dried with compressed air. Prior to the compact layer deposition, the samples were cleaned with ultraviolet/O3 treatment for 30 minutes.
A TiO2 compact layer was deposited by spray pyrolysis at 450 °C using 0.5 mL of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetyl acetonate) precursor solution (75% in 2-propanol, Sigma Aldrich) in 19.5 mL of absolute ethanol using O2 as a carrier gas. After finishing the spray pyrolysis deposition, the samples were kept for another 30 minutes at 450 °C to facilitate the anatase formation. Once the samples are at room temperature, they are subjected to TiCl4 treatment, immersing them in a 0.02 M TiCl4 solution in deionized water at 70 °C for 30 minutes. This was followed by washing with deionized water, heating at 500 °C for 15 minutes and left to cool down slowly until room temperature.
After that, the porous electron transporting layers (TiO2 tilted nanocolumns) were deposited according the above-mentioned procedures. For the mesoporous devices, 18NR-T paste (Dyesol) was diluted in absolute ethanol (1 g paste in 3.5 g of ethanol) and deposited by spin coating at 5000 rpm for 30 s.
Later, perovskite was prepared by sequential deposition, following the currently reported article guidelines for high-performance perovskite cells.3 Therefore, a lead iodide (PbI2) film was deposited by spin coating (6500 rpm for 30 s with 5500 rpm s−1 as acceleration) using 50 μL per cell of PbI2 solution in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) that was kept at 70 °C under vigorous stirring. To avoid insolubility issues, the PbI2 solution in DMF was previously dissolved at 115 °C and cooled down until reaching 70 °C, the temperature which is maintained during the whole PbI2 deposition process. After the spin coating process, the cells were placed on a hot plate at 70 °C for 30 minutes for annealing. After cooling down the samples to room temperature, the cells were dipped in the MAI solution in 2-propanol (8–10 mg mL−1 depending the case) for 20 s, the moment when the change of color from yellow to dark brown-black was observed; when prewetting technique was employed, the samples were dipped in pure 2-propanol for 5 s before dipping for 30 s in the MAI solution. Subsequently they were rinsed in 2-propanol and dried using a spin coater at 4000 rpm for 30 s, and finally it was annealed again at 70 °C for 30 minutes.
The hole transporting materials (HTMs) were deposited later: either using a Spiro-OMeTAD or PTAA. For Spiro-OMeTAD, 35 μL of solution were dropwise added onto substrates and deposited by spin coating at 4000 rpm for 30 s using an acceleration of 1650 rpm s−1; for PTAA, 2000 rpm for also 30 s was selected. Spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg of Spiro-OMeTAD in 1 mL of chlorobenzene; 21.9 μL of tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyrydine)cobalt(III) bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide (FK209) stock solution (400 mg of FK209 in 1 mL of acetonitrile), 17.5 μL of lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide (LiTFSI) stock solution (520 mg of LiTFSI in 1 mL of acetonitrile) and 28.8 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine (t-BP) were also added to the solution as additives. PTAA solution was prepared by dissolving 30 mg of PTAA in 1 mL of toluene; 18.8 μL of lithium LiTFSI stock solution (170 mg of LiTFSI in 1 mL of acetonitrile) and 9.4 μL of t-BP were added as well. The device fabrication was finished with 80 nm of gold as metallic contact (cathode) deposited by thermal evaporation under a vacuum (1 × 10−6 and 1 × 10−5 torr).
PbI2, MAI, Spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA solutions were prepared inside an argon glove box with controlled moisture and oxygen conditions (H2O level: <1 ppm and O2 level: <10 ppm). PbI2 spin coating, MAI dipping and HTM spin coating deposition were performed inside a dry box.
Characterization
For J–V curves, a 450 W Xe lamp (Oriel) with a Schott K113 Tempax sunlight filter (Praezisions Glas & Optik GmbH) was employed as a light source. A digital source meter (Keithly Model 2400) was used to supply the voltage to the cell while the current was recorded. Sun intensity was measured just before each single device with the help of a Si reference cell.
For IPCE measurements, a 300 W Xe lamp (ILC Technology) was connected to a Gemini-180 double monochromator (Jobin Yvon Ltd.) to obtain an appropriated light beam. A constant white light bias (5–10% of the received light) was found recommendable to measure perovskite cells, so an array of white LEDS was used for that purpose. A Model SR830 DSP Lock-in Amplifier (Standford Research Systems) was utilized to record the performance. For both J–V and IPCE measurements the active area was fixed to be 0.285 cm2 using a mask unless other indications were specified at a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1. The scan rate and the active area used for measuring the devices were optimized as such to calculate the real value of efficiency without the hysteresis effect. To measure the absorbance spectra of the cells, a (Hewlett Packard 8453) spectrophotometer was used. The scanning electron microscopy images were imaged by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) using a Hitachi S5200 field emission microscope operating at 5.0 keV.
C Results and discussion
A schematic configuration of the Physical Vapor Deposition at oblique angles (PVD-OAD) is shown in Fig. 1a from which it is apparent that by controlling the position of the samples along the x-axis it is possible to select a given zenithal deposition angle (α). The basic characteristic of the PVD-OAD method is that both the tilting angle of the nanocolumns and the porosity of the film can be tuned by adequately regulating the deposition angle α.27–29 In general, the porosity and the tilting angle of nanocolumns increase with the deposition angle, with the previously reported tilting angles (β) of 34° and 47° and porosities of 49% and 67% (v/v) for TiO2 thin films deposited at zenithal angles (α) of 70° and 85°, respectively.28Fig. 1b shows a scheme of a cell device incorporating a TiO2 nanocolumnar thin film structure as a photoanode. To confirm the shape of the nanocolumnar TiO2 layer, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) studies were carried out. Fig. 2a and b show cross-sectional SEM micrographs of the nanocolumnar films deposited on a silicon wafer for the two zenithal evaporation angles (α = 70° and 85°) used in the present work. These micrographs show that α = 70° (Fig. 2a) renders less tilted nanocolumns (tilting angle β = 34°) than α = 85° (β = 47°) (Fig. 2b) and confirm that the 85° film is less compact and presents a higher porosity than the 70° film in agreement with previous results.27,28 In Fig. 2c, a top view SEM from a nanocolumnar PVD-OAD TiO2 film deposited on silicon confirms that the nanocolumns are extremely well ordered and homogeneously packaged, featuring the contrast of the microstructures of TiO2 thin films obtained by chemical routes generally characterized by an uneven distribution of their building blocks. When the perovskite film is deposited on the surface of this TiO2 (Fig. 2d) it forms a very conformal capping layer terminated on a flat surface, a condition required for highly efficient perovskite solar cells. To illustrate the topology of the system when it is prepared on FTO glass containing the compact TiO2 layer, the SEM micrograph in Fig. 2e shows the cross-section after deposition of the perovskite. From bottom to top of this image, layers due to FTO (400 nm), compact TiO2 (ca. 100 nm), and nanocolumnar TiO2 deposited by PVD-OAD (ca. 530 nm, thicker than the optimum value for better visualization) and perovskite (ca. 100 nm) are clearly distinguished. A cross-sectional image of the full cell device with a 200 nm thick TiO2 layer including the hole collector layer and the gold upper electrode is shown in Fig. 2f. In this figure there are some hints that the TiO2 nanocolumnar film deposited at 85° is infiltrated by the perovskite (i.e., it consists of a NC-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 hybrid layer). Over this photoanode, a capping CH3NH3PbI3 layer and a ∼150 nm thick Spiro-OMeTAD overlayer can be also observed. Overall, these two images show that the subsequent deposition of the different layers stacked in the cell according to the scheme in Fig. 1b proceeds homogeneously in a layer by layer fashion without patches or large inhomogeneities.

Note that (a) is more focused and zoomed. 
To prove the homogeneous infiltration of the perovskite within the pores of the TiO2 nanocolumnar films, ToF-SIMS measurements were carried out with the FTO/NC-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 structure depicted in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 shows the elemental depth profiles obtained for this structure where a rather thick NC-TiO2 photoanode (530 nm) has been included to prove the excellent infiltration properties of the perovskite material even for a less advantageous case. This figure shows the evolution of the peak intensity as a function of etching time for selected ion masses corresponding to Ti+, SiO+, Sn+, PbO+ and Pb+ species. An attribution of depth zones according to the scheme in Fig. 1b is included in the depth profile figure. The lead species (PbO+ and Pb+) can be taken as a probe for the distribution of the perovskite within the NC-TiO2 layer. Other species such as I+, ionized methyl and ammonia groups and other fragments of the perovskite structure were also detected during this investigation and presented profiles that run in parallel to those of Pb+ and PbO+. The most outstanding feature from this analysis is that the Ti+ signal in the zone corresponding to the porous TiO2 runs parallel to the signals attributed to the perovskite, a feature demonstrating that CH3NH3PbI3 has been completely infiltrated within the NC-TiO2 film and it is well distributed through its pore structure. Also, a closer look of the plots in Fig. 3 provides some additional information about the different layers existing in the perovskite solar cell. For example, by looking at the initial stages of the ion etching process it is apparent that the Pb+ and Ti+ lines have, respectively, slightly higher and lower intensities than in the central plateau of the profile. This agrees with the cross-sections in Fig. 2e and f and, particularly, Fig. 2d (SEM images), showing that a thin perovskite layer is covering the NC-TiO2 film in the form of a capping layer. Similarly, the Pb+ line decreases prior to the Ti+ signal, confirming the existence of a 100 nm compact TiO2 layer at the bottom of the structure (Fig. 2e and f). On the other hand, the line attributed to Sn+ must proceed from the FTO substrate since it sharply increases in intensity when etching this zone of the structure. Moreover, the stepped shape of the Sn+ profile with some minute intensity within the “100 nm TiO2 zone” suggests some minor diffusion (note the logarithmic scale of the plot) of tin within this TiO2 layer during the different annealing treatments of the system.

To fabricate efficient devices, some preliminary studies with the same TiO2 nanocolumnar film were carried out to optimize the perovskite deposition methodology. The selected thickness to carry out these previous studies was 300 nm, since this value is common in the studies using mesoporous TiO2 based systems.3 Meanwhile, the deposition angle was chosen at 70° similar to TiO2 PVD-OAD films previously tested in liquid DSSCs.27 The obtained results are summarized in Table S2 and the J–V curves are shown in Fig. S1.† It was found that an increase in VOC and a decrease in JSC are observed when the methyl ammonium iodide (MAI) concentration is increased until 10 mg mL−1. The best CH3NH3I concentration was then established at a compromise value of 8 mg mL−1. On the other hand, regarding lead iodide, the JSC remained relatively high and stable around 18 mA cm−2 up to concentrations of 1.45 M, where it starts to decrease. An analogous evolution was found for the fill factor that remained relatively stable at around 0.6 with the exception of a decrease observed for the most concentrated solutions. Meanwhile a maximum value of VOC was found for 1.25 M solutions, conditions that also yield an optimum value of the PCE of the device. Therefore 1.25 M for PbI2 and 8 mg mL−1 for MAI solutions were considered as the best conditions for the deposition of the perovskite over the 300 nm NC-TiO2 photoanodes, obtaining 10.22% of PCE at full sun and a slightly higher efficiency (10.39%) at 10% of sunlight. Increasing the loading of PbI2 (chromophore) to 1.25 M increases the light harvesting capability of the system, however at much higher loading it may slow down the conversion process of perovskites.
Next, a study of the photoanode architectures was carried out to check the influence of thicknesses and evaporation angles in the performance of the devices. A summary of the obtained results is shown in Table 1 and Fig. 4. Minute differences in PCE were observed on comparing the 200 and 300 nm thick photoanodes or as a function of the evaporation angle used. The best cell was obtained with a 200 nm thick NC-TiO2 layer deposited at 85° angle, which showed a PCE of 10.53% (JSC = 16.68 mA cm−2, VOC = 949.8 mV and FF = 0.639).

 Fig. 4  (a) Short-circuit current (JSC), (b) open-circuit voltage (VOC), (c) fill factor and (d) power conversion efficiency shown for the perovskite sensitized solar cells as a function of thickness and angle of the photoanode deposition. Solid rhombus, squares, triangles and circles linked with solid lines were prepared with 70° as the evaporation glancing angle (α). Hollow rhombus, squares, triangles and circles linked with dashed lines were prepared with 85° as the evaporation glancing angle (α). 
In contrast to these optimum conditions, 100 and 500 nm thick photoanodes did not render efficient solar cells. In the former case, a low JSC value was determined, very likely because of a very poor conversion of incident photons into electrons (IPCE) (Fig. 5a and b). This suggests that not enough perovskite was deposited over and infiltrated inside these films. Moreover, for the 100 nm film thickness, the 70° films were surprisingly better than the 85° ones, in apparent contradiction with the higher porosity of the latter (i.e., 67% pore volume versus 49%, respectively27,28). In principle, when the NC-TiO2 film gets thicker, it is expected that more perovskite becomes infiltrated within the films, leading to a higher efficiency in photon collection and conversion into electrons, as shown by the IPCE curves in Fig. 5b. Consequently, a tradeoff maximum in the photogenerated current was found with the 300 nm thick photoanodes that presented short circuit current values similar to the maximum ones presented in the literature.34,35 When films become thicker than 300 nm, JSC starts to decrease again. This phenomenon has also been reported31,32 (Table S1†) and identified by a decrease in JSC always in that the 1-dimensional photoanode becomes thick. For the 300 nm NC-TiO2 films, no differences with the variation of the deposition angle α were observed, while for the 200 nm thick films, JSC did improve for the highly porous films prepared at α = 85°. Considering VOC, a maximum value was also observed at 200 nm and then decreases for thicker films (Table 1, Fig. 4 and 5a). A decrease in VOC with the photoanode thickness is in accordance with previous results in the literature31,32,34 and can be easily explained by considering that for too long 1-dimensional fibers (nanowires, nanorods or nanocolumns) recombination phenomena at the larger interface of photoanode–absorber can significantly augment as well. Another interesting observation is that the FF decreases with the thickness of the photoanode, a feature that can be related to the increment of series resistance related to longer wires and recombination because longer columns have more surface for recombination at the interface of TiO2–perovskite and issues. This general tendency agrees with our values (Table 1, Fig. 4 and 5) with the exception of the thinnest TiO2 layers (100 nm) for which the low efficiency hampers the achievement of acceptable fill factors. Transient photocurrent experiments were carried out (Fig. S2†) and it shows a relatively slow response for thicker NC-TiO2 (500 nm), while in the case of 200 nm (85°) and 300 nm (70°), a linear response was observed, which is in well agreement with the results.

To summarize, the PCE of the NC-TiO2 based devices is directly related to JSC, VOC and FF, so that the overall efficiency of the devices is a tradeoff between these parameters. 300 nm thick NC-TiO2 photoanodes were the best in terms of current but 200 nm thick ones showed a significantly better voltage performance and a higher FF and, as a result, gave the best PCE of 10.53%. The 200 nm NC-TiO2 photoanode prepared at α = 85° resulted better in terms of PCE (10.53% when α = 85° for only 9.29% for α = 70°) due to the differences in JSC. For the 300 nm thick films prepared at two deposition angles, the differences in the photovoltaic parameters were really small leading to a similar PCE (9.75% when α = 85°; 10.22% for α = 70°). It is important to note that very homogeneous porous structures have been fabricated with the implementation of the PVD-OAD technique, obtaining efficient cells with the thinnest films reported for perovskite solar cells over nanocolumnar films.31,34,35
The NC-TiO2 films prepared were also tested with a poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) hole transporting material. The fabricated devices gave low PV performance and a PCE of 3.62% (JSC = 7.291 mA cm−2, VOC = 825.3 mV and FF = 0.576) was measured. PTAA is a polymer with a higher molecular weight than Spiro-OMeTAD (17500 Da w.r.t only 1225.45 Da). In the case of PTAA a bilayer contact between perovskite and HTM was expected compared to the infiltrated Spiro-OMeTAD. We believe that the lower voltages and fill factors obtained here are due to inefficient charge collection through the nanocolumns indicating that optimization of perovskite infiltration is required.
The absorbance spectra (Fig. 5c) of the cell prior to the deposition of gold show very high absorbance for the 200 nm NC-TiO2 thick films. Fig. 6 represents the PV parameters plotted as a function of time to evaluate the stability of the fabricated perovskite solar cells using the nanocolumnar photoanodes prepared by PVD-OAD. The devices were used as such and were not encapsulated. The time dependent performance was then compared with a standard mesoporous (mp-TiO2) based photoanode cell of comparable PV performance. For this experiment all solar cells were kept under dark conditions and dry air (<2% R.H.) until performing the measurement. In general, comparable trends were observed for the efficiency of both photoanode structures (NC-TiO2 and mp-TiO2), with the best values obtained after one day, in all likelihood due to better infiltration of active materials inside the structure. However, in the case of NC-TiO2 devices, an improvement of VOC was observed after this period of time, while for the mp-TiO2 cell this enhancement was due to a shift in JSC. Regarding JSC, stable values were obtained for NC-TiO2, while the short-circuit current was increased after one day and then decreased with time for the mp-TiO2 sample. FF was found to have a negligible effect in both cases and improved efficiencies with time were obtained for NC-TiO2 photoanodes. Thus relatively stable solar cells were obtained with the presented photoanode prepared by the PVD-OAD technique due to its 1-directional orientation and less exposure of the perovskite. The calculated decrease in efficiency after a week was only 14.7% (from 10.53% to 8.58%), while for the standard one, the decrease was about 25% (from 10.59% to 7.94%). This suggests that the infiltration of the perovskite in this NC-TiO2 porous film is advantageous compared to the mesoporous TiO2 layers with respect to the perovskite stability.

D Conclusions
A simple, efficient, facile and industrially scalable method is presented here for the deposition of 1-dimensional nanocolumnar TiO2 to be used as photoanodes in perovskite solar cells. Porous and homogeneous 1D-TiO2 nanocolumnar thin films were fabricated through this proven methodology. The prepared photoanodes were then employed for perovskites solar cell fabrication and power conversion efficiencies close to 11% were obtained, which is the highest for TiO2 1-dimensional nanostructures ever reported to date. This performance proves that the presented methodology can meet the standards required for practical application and large area integration. The thickness of TiO2 and angle of deposition has bearing on its PV properties. Thinner NC-TiO2 1-dimensional films yielded an enhancement in the JSC that has been related to an the increment of the porosity and the excellent infiltration of the absorber along the thin film structure. Nanocolumunar structures with a 200 nm thickness gave optimum efficiencies showing remarkable JSC keeping VOC and fill factor high. The facile electron collection in these 1-dimensional nanocolumn devices resulted in more stable systems than those mesoporous ones prepared by spin coating TiO2. Surface analyses (SIMS and SEM) have shown that the perovskites are fully infiltrated in these nanocolumnar structures and fully cover the TiO2 surface. We believe that the presented thin film process techniques bring new dimension for perovskite solar cell fabrication and for their industrial integration.
