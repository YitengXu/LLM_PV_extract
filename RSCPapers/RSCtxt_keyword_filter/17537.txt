    , Accepted 2nd December 2016First published on 2nd December 2016AbstractEthylenediamine (EDA) functionalized fullerene nanoparticles as independent electron transport layers (ETLs) for inverted polymer solar cells exhibited high electronic conductivity and low work function. Compared with ZnO, the power conversion efficiency of the devices based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM was increased from 9.1% to 10.06% with C60–EDA ETLs and to 9.49% with Gd@C82–EDA, mainly due to the greatly improved short current density.
Photovoltaic technology has been acknowledged as a promising way to provide green and renewable energy for the growing needs. In recent years, inverted polymer solar cells (i-PSCs) have attracted tremendous attention due to their synergetic advantages of high power conversion efficiency (PCE), good long-term stability and nice flexibility for roll-to-roll manufacturing.1–8 The performance of i-PSCs is majorly dependent on the optical and electrical properties of electron transport layers (ETLs) as well as the interfacial contact between ETLs and the active layer.9–12 ZnO is treated as the most common ETL of i-PSCs because of its relatively high electron mobility, good optical transparency and ease of preparation with low-cost solution methods.7,13–18 However, ZnO-based devices always suffer from serious trap-induced recombination at the interface between ZnO and the active layer.19–23 Therefore, fullerene-based interlayers that are structurally similar to fullerene acceptors have been widely implemented to pursue excellent compatibility with the active layer and better electron collection.24–29 They are introduced to effectively reduce the interfacial charge recombination, improve the morphology of the active layer and enhance the charge selectivity.30–33
Herein, we developed ethylenediamine (EDA) functionalized fullerene nanoparticles (NPs) as a high-efficiency independent ETL, which overtook ZnO to obtain better electron conductivity and lower work function. Fullerene–EDA NPs were prepared via a facile solid–liquid reaction, and they could be coated on ITO and annealed at a relatively low temperature compared with ZnO. In addition, metallofullerene-based acceptors with a relatively high LUMO level have effectively improved the PCE of PSCs,34,35 and metallofullerene Gd@C82 is initially involved in photovoltaic application as an efficient ETL. Compared with ZnO that improved the PCE of PTB7-Th:PC71BM based inverted devices from 3.02% to 9.10%, Gd@C82–EDA improved the performance to 9.49%, and C60–EDA successfully increased that to 10.03%. The PCE improvement is majorly ascribed to the enhancements of the short current density (Jsc), and an analogous performance elevation is also observed for PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM based devices, indicating that fullerene–EDA ETLs work efficiently for various i-PSCs.
C60–EDA and Gd@C82–EDA NPs were prepared separately via a facile solid–liquid reaction as described in the ESI.† Multiple EDA moieties were directly bonded to a fullerene cluster through nucleophilic addition to afford fullerene–EDA nanoparticles (Scheme S1†). Moreover, as EDA exhibits a common affinity for various fullerenes, a variety of EDA-modified fullerene nanoparticles can be analogously prepared, which provide numerous candidates for efficient ETLs. Elemental analysis (EA) was performed to reveal the average chemical composition of fullerene–EDA NPs. Considering the relative contents of carbon and nitrogen (Table S1†), their average compositions are estimated as C60–(EDA)9 and Gd@C82–(EDA)8.
The interaction between fullerenes and EDA moieties was further confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier translation infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The vibrational bands of –NH (ca. 3300–3400 cm−1) and –CH (ca. 2880–3000 cm−1), and the stretching bands (ca. 1450, 1650 cm−1) of the carbon cage are observed for C60–EDA and Gd@C82–EDA (Fig. 1a and b), definitely indicating that EDA moieties have been bonded to C60 and Gd@C82, respectively. The C1s peaks centered at the binding energies of 284.7 eV and 285.7 eV are assigned to C–C and C–N(H) for C60–EDA (Fig. 1c), and the C1s peaks located at 284.8 eV and 286.1 eV correspond to C–C and C–N(H) for Gd@C82–EDA (Fig. 1d). As there exist multiple EDA moieties on their surface, C60–EDA and Gd@C82–EDA exhibit positive zeta potentials of 23.0 eV and 34.3 eV in water (Fig. S3†), respectively, indicating that they possess good stability as nanoparticles.

In order to study the performance of i-PSCs after introducing fullerene–EDA ETLs, the inverted devices based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM with or without the ETLs were fabricated. As shown in Scheme 1, the basic structure of the i-PSCs with the ETL is ITO/ETL/active layer/MoO3/Ag, and they are characterized under simulated AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). Compared with ZnO that decreases the Jsc from 17.20 to 17.06 mA cm−2, Gd@C82–EDA majorly increases it to 18.63 mA cm−2, and C60–EDA improves it to 18.64 mA cm−2 (Fig. 2a and Table 1). As a result, Gd@C82–EDA improves the PCE of the i-PSC up to 9.49%, and C60–EDA improves that to 10.06%. Recently, with the developments of novel interface materials and device engineering, high efficiencies of over 10% have been achieved by employing PBDTTT polymers in single-junction PSCs with multiple device structures.36 However, compared with the excellent interface materials like PFN and FPI–PEIE that respectively improve the PCE of single-junction PSCs up to 10.61% and 10.4%,3,37 fullerene–EDA NPs are more feasibly prepared and C60–EDA NPs exhibit a similar high performance as an independent ETL for i-PSCs. A slightly lower PCE is obtained with Gd@C82–EDA for the relatively lower fill factor compared with C60–EDA, which might be attributed to the less compatibility between Gd@C82–EDA and the acceptor PC71BM arising from the remarkably different electronic structure of Gd@C82 and C70. Furthermore, as various fullerene–EDA nanoparticles can be analogously prepared with other fullerenes like C70, we are still trying to investigate other fullerene–EDA ETLs to pursue a better performance.

Furthermore, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices with and without the ETLs were performed to confirm the photocurrent improvement after the introduction of fullerene–EDA ETLs (Fig. 2b). The integrated currents from the EQE analysis are 16.73 mA cm−2 for the device without the ETL, 16.71 mA cm−2 for the device with ZnO, 17.89 mA cm−2 for that with Gd@C82–EDA, 17.83 mA cm−2 for that with C60–EDA, which well correspond to their Jsc in Table 1. The EQE responses of the devices with fullerene–EDA ETLs are comparably higher than that of the device with ZnO over the regions of 300–430 nm and 530–750 nm, and this well manifests that fullerene–EDA ETLs have improved the EQE of devices.
In addition, to confirm the universality of the fullerene–EDA ETLs in different active layer systems, we fabricated analogous ETL-incorporated i-PSCs based on PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM. Compared with ZnO that improves the PCE of PBDTTT-C-T based devices from 0.5% to 7.10%, Gd@C82–EDA improves the performance to 7.44%, and C60–EDA enhances that to 7.55% (Fig. S4 and Table S2†). These improvements in the PCE are also attributed to the enhancement of Jsc, suggesting that fullerene–EDA NPs are high-efficiency ETLs for various systems.
In order to reveal the improved Jsc of the i-PSCs with fullerene–EDA ETLs, the electronic conductivities of ZnO and fullerene–EDA thin layers were investigated at a bias voltage of 0.5 V by atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 3, the surface currents are observed to be equably distributed on the whole films of ZnO and fullerene–EDA. The maximum current observed for ZnO is about 1.5 nA, whilst that for C60–EDA is 3.5 nA and 3.3 nA for Gd@C82–EDA. C60–EDA exhibited slightly better conductivity than Gd@C82–EDA, which was probably attributed to the fact that C60–EDA possessed one more EDA moiety bonded on the carbon cage in average than Gd@C82–EDA and the EDA moieties help improve the compatibility between fullerene–EDA and the ITO cathode. Compared with ZnO, much better electronic conductivity is achieved with fullerene–EDA ETLs. This high surface electronic conductivity induces the transport of separated electrons from the active layer through the fullerene ETL to the respective cathode,38–40 and thus a higher Jsc was achieved for the i-PSCs with fullerene–EDA ETLs rather than with ZnO. Moreover, smooth surfaces are obtained with fullerene–EDA ETLs as shown in Fig. S5,† which also play important roles in the high-performance i-PSCs.

ETLs should possess a matched work function to promote the efficient extraction of electrons, so ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was carried out to study the work functions of the ITO and ITO/fullerene–EDA layers separately. Considering the secondary electron cutoff regions in Fig. 4, the work functions of ITO, ITO/ZnO, ITO/C60–EDA and ITO/Gd@C82–EDA are determined to be 4.56, 3.98, 3.77, and 3.92 eV, respectively. Therefore, compared with ITO/ZnO, the work function of ITO/C60–EDA decreases by 0.21 eV, and that of ITO/Gd@C82–EDA drops by 0.06 eV, which is attributed to the spontaneous interfacial dipoles derived from fullerene–EDA ETLs.41–44 These decreased work functions facilitate the electron extraction and collection of the cathode, consequently improving the Jsc of the corresponding devices.

In addition, the role of the fullerene–EDA ETLs was further clarified by measuring the reflectance spectra of the devices according to the reported procedure.45 As shown in Fig. 5, the reflectance spectra exhibit additional absorption in the range of 300–800 nm for the ITO/fullerene–EDA ETL/PTB7-Th:PC71BM (1:1.5 w/w, 90 nm)/MoO3/Ag devices compared with the reference (ITO/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag). Since the spectral features of the active layer (PTB7-Th:PC71BM) are evident in the additional absorption, the increased absorption arises from a better distribution of the light intensity in the PTB7-Th:PC71BM composite film, which improves the photocurrent by increasing the photogeneration of excitons.46 The two devices are identical except for the fullerene–EDA ETL, and thus it's revealed that fullerene–EDA ETLs facilitate the production of more excitons in the active layer to improve photocurrents. In comparison with ZnO as the ETL, the devices with Gd@C82–EDA or C60–EDA as the ETL exhibit comparably stronger absorption over the range of 550–800 nm, which is also in accordance with their EQE responses in Fig. 2b. Therefore, fullerene–EDA ETLs induce more excitons at the active layer to improve the photocurrent, which synergistically contributes to the high Jsc of the devices.

Conclusions
We have prepared fullerene–EDA NPs via a facile solid–liquid reaction, which worked efficiently as independent electron transport layers to exhibit high electronic conductivity and low work function. The introduction of fullerene–EDA ETLs enhanced the photocurrent by inducing more excitons at the active layer, facilitated the transport of separated electrons, and promoted the efficient electron extraction and collection of the cathode, which synergistically improved the short current density of i-PSCs. Therefore, compared with ZnO as the ETL, the PCE of the devices based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM was increased from 9.1% to 10.06% with C60–EDA as the ETL and to 9.49% with Gd@C82–EDA, mainly due to the great improvements of the Jsc. Moreover, an analogous performance elevation was also observed for the PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM based devices with fullerene–EDA ETLs, indicating that fullerene–EDA ETLs are quite efficient for various inverted polymer solar cells.
