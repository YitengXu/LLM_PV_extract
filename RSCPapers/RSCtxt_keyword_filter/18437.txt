    , Accepted 27th July 2018First published on 27th July 2018AbstractA 3D type perylenediimide (PDI)-based molecule (TPE-PDI4) is successfully applied as an efficient electron transporting material in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). TPE-PDI4 has been previously demonstrated as an excellent non-fullerene electron acceptor in high-performance bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells. Considering its decent electron mobility and outstanding solution processability with favorable thin-film morphology, as well as compatible energy levels with perovskite materials, TPE-PDI4 serves as a promising candidate as the electron transport layer (ETL) material for perovskite solar cells. Herein, we report the fabrication of inverted perovskite solar cells using TPE-PDI4 as the electron transporting layer. A high PCE of 16.29% is obtained, which is higher than that obtained using a PCBM-based electron transporting layer under the same testing conditions. On the other hand, TPE-PDI4 also works well as an interfacial layer between perovskite and C60. A high efficiency of 18.78% is achieved in PSCs with TPE-PDI4 compared to a lower efficiency of 16.56% without this interlayer, indicating an enhanced charge transport/collection with the insertion of TPE-PDI4. Additionally, TPE-PDI4 shows a better water-resistibility than PCBM, which could more effectively protect the perovskite layer beneath. Therefore, devices with a TPE-PDI4-based ETL exhibit an enhanced stability. Our results demonstrate the great potential of TPE-PDI4 to replace expensive fullerene-based ETLs.
Introduction
The rapid development of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in recent years reveals a powerful competitor in the photovoltaic community.1–5 Perovskite materials have many merits such as high absorption coefficients, a wide absorption range, a direct bandgap, and long charge diffusion lengths.6,7 Since the first effort of perovskite materials being used as a light absorber in dye-sensitized solar cells, that enabled an efficiency of 3.8%, a 22.7% certified maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been realized in less than a decade.8–10 In this regard, PSCs have generated broad research interest in the fields of both photovoltaic technology and material development.
Generally, there are two device architectures for PSCs, that are, conventional n–i–p and inverted p–i–n configurations with appropriate charge extraction materials. For the n–i–p type device, a hole transporting material (HTM) is deposited between the perovskite layer and the metal electrode (Ag or Au). As a typical example, spiro-OMeTAD (2,2-7,7-tetrakis(N,N′-diparamethoxy-phenylamine) 9,9′-spirobifluorene) is one of the most efficient HTMs.11 However, the hygroscopic dopants tend to affect device stability. In contrast to the n–i–p PSCs, in the p–i–n architecture, an electron transporting material (ETM) is needed to extract electrons from the perovskite layer and then transport them to the counter electrode. Inorganic metal oxides (TiO2, ZnO, SnO2, etc.) have been employed as ETMs, but a high annealing temperature is often required, which limits the potential large-scale production and flexible application of this device platform.12–15 In contrast, the electron transporting layer made from organic materials like fullerene and its derivatives, e.g. [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) can avoid the annealing procedure.16,17 These organic semiconductors have compatible lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels and high electron mobilities, and are commonly used as ETMs in PSCs. However, fullerenes are expensive, and they usually have poor ambient stability.18 In addition, they are prone to aggregation, which may result in a poor film morphology, which is detrimental for charge extraction and conduction.19 Therefore, there is a strong demand to develop cost-effective non-fullerene organic ETMs with comparable performances to fullerenes in inverted PSCs.
Efforts have been devoted to synthesizing organic ETMs for PSCs. For instance, n-type hexaazatrinaphtho[2,3-c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (HATNT), hexaazatrinaphthylene derivatives, naphthalene diimide (NDI) and perylene diimide (PDI)-based compounds were developed.20–25 Among these organic materials, PDIs with rigid planar aromatic structures typically show high electron mobilities (SCLC, 0.2–1.3 cm2 V−1 s−1)26–28 and conductivities (3.3 × 10−3–4.4 × 10−2 S cm−1),29,30 and are recognized as potential candidates to replace fullerenes. Despite the fact that PDI derivatives show excellent performance as non-fullerene acceptors in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells, they are not fully explored in p–i–n type inverted PSCs. Recently, P. A. Troshin and coworkers pointed out that MAPbI3 volatile products may diffuse through the PCBM layer and reach the metal electrode, which is detrimental for device performance of such inverted PSCs. Instead, PDI derivatives were proved to provide good isolation for MAPbI3 films and prevent decomposition of the perovskite.31
Structurally speaking, the large planar aromatic rings in PDIs tend to aggregate, which provides the molecules too large a propensity to aggregate and decreases the solution processability as well as film quality. Through judicious modification of their chemical structures, molecular twisting can be introduced to prevent PDIs from forming excessively large aggregates. An archetypal example demonstrating this design rule is a 3D type molecule, TPE-PDI4, comprising a tetraphenylethylene core surrounded by four PDIs, which has been successfully applied as an efficient non-fullerene acceptor material for organic solar cells (structure shown in Fig. 1).32,33 The electron mobility of TPE-PDI4 determined by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method is about 1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, comparable to that of PC61BM (2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 by the same method).34,35 Moreover, TPE-PDI4 has similar energy levels to PCBM.32 With a highly-twisted 3D molecular structure, it has a good solubility in common organic solvents (Fig. 1). Taking all these merits into account, TPE-PDI4 has great potential to serve as an effective ETM in inverted perovskite solar cells. Consequently, in this work, we investigated the electron transport properties of TPE-PDI4 and evaluated its performance in inverted perovskite solar cells, alongside the commonly used PCBM for comparison. It turned out that the PSC with a TPE-PDI4 ETL provides a PCE of 16.29%, which is slightly higher than that with PCBM (15.27%). Notably, the optimized performance of PSCs employing TPE-PDI4 as the ETL rivals those of most of the PSCs using non-fullerenes ETMs with a similar device configuration.25,36–40 In addition, TPE-PDI4 has also been demonstrated to be a decent interfacial material, and a high efficiency of nearly 19% was achieved with this interlayer. In contrast, a lower efficiency of 16.56% was obtained without the TPE-PDI4 interlayer. Also, TPE-PDI4 showed a better water-resistibility than PCBM. Therefore, the results demonstrate that TPE-PDI4 has great potential to replace the expensive PCBM in perovskite solar cells.

Results and discussion
Inverted planar perovskite solar cells (p–i–n) were fabricated, and the electron transport properties of TPE-PDI4 were systematically studied by employing it as the ETL and as the interfacial layer between perovskite and a C60 ETL, respectively. Consequently, devices with a configuration of ITO/P3CT-Na/perovskite/TPE-PDI4/rhodamine 101/LiF/Ag were fabricated, in which TPE-PDI4 served as the electron transport material and rhodamine 101 and LiF as thin buffer layers. In addition, the ITO/P3CT-Na/perovskite/TPE-PDI4/C60/BCP/Ag type devices were also fabricated, where TPE-PDI4 served as the ultrathin interfacial layer to assist electron extraction from perovskite to C60 ETM. In both types of devices, CH3NH3PbI3 was deposited in a two-step process to form the perovskite layer. P3CT-Na was applied as the hole transport material, which was spin-coated onto the ITO substrate following methods reported previously.41 For devices with the TPE-PDI4 ETL, a rhodamine 101 buffer layer was spin-coated on top of the TPE-PDI4 layer,42 and according to the literature, 1 nm thick LiF was then thermally evaporated followed by the deposition of 100 nm Ag as the counter electrode. For the device using TPE-PDI4 as a thin interlayer, C60 (20 nm) and BCP (8 nm) were evaporated under high vacuum on top of the ITO/P3CT-Na/Perovskite/TPE-PDI4.
The morphology of the ETL on top of the perovskite layer beneath was studied by AFM, as shown in Fig. 2. The bare perovskite film exhibits large crystal domains with a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 24.6 nm. Obviously, the film roughness decreases significantly when PCBM or TPE-PDI4 is deposited on top, resulting in lower RMS roughness of 17.7 nm for PCBM and 11.1 nm for TPE-PDI4, suggesting that the deposited ETM has a high coverage on the perovskite layer, which makes the surface smoother. It is noteworthy that TPE-PDI4 exhibits a smoother surface morphology than PCBM, which is favorable for reducing the contact area between the perovskite and the counter electrode and increasing the selective charge extraction. The cross-sectional SEM images of the devices in different configurations are shown in Fig. S1.† For the two device architectures, a perovskite layer with large grains is sandwiched between a P3CT-Na layer and an electron transport layer. The perovskite layer expands across the whole thickness, and also confirms a high coverage on the substrate.

To investigate the effect of the ETM on photoluminescence quenching and charge extraction, steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were measured. Fig. 3a shows the steady-state PL curves of glass/perovskite and glass/perovskite/ETM. When excited at 480 nm, the perovskite film shows a strong emission at 780 nm. After depositing TPE-PDI4 or PCBM on top of the perovskite layer, the emission is significantly quenched. Notably, both materials have similar quenching efficiency of up to 90%, revealing that both materials are good quenchers of the electrons from the perovskite. Fig. 3b presents the TRPL spectra of the perovskite, perovskite/TPE-PDI4 and perovskite/PCBM films. Obviously, when TPE-PDI4 or PCBM is coated onto the perovskite layer, the PL lifetime exhibits a sharp decline. The fitted PL lifetime for the bare perovskite film is about 243 ns, upon coating with a TPE-PDI4 or a PCBM layer, the PL lifetime dramatically decreases to 9.2 ns and 15.3 ns, respectively. The more accelerated PL decay with TPE-PDI4 ETL suggests that the electron quenching/extraction properties of TPE-PDI4 is even higher than PCBM, further demonstrating its potential as an alternative to PCBM to construct efficient PSCs.

To study the photovoltaic performance, inverted planar PSCs were fabricated with TPE-PDI4 as the ETL and rhodamine 101 and LiF as thin buffer layers (Fig. 4a). With different thicknesses of the TPE-PDI4 layer, the corresponding devices show different performances. The J–V curves are presented in Fig. 4, and the data are summarized in Tables 1 and S1.† As shown in Fig. 4b, too thin a TPE-PDI4 layer leads to a leakage current behavior, and thus quite low Voc, Jsc and FF values. When the film thickness of TPE-PDI4 increases from 5 nm to 37 nm, the power conversion efficiency of PSCs gradually increases. However, further increase of the thickness (∼45 nm) leads to a decline of the device performance, due to the increased series resistance. As a result, the optimized thickness of the TPE-PDI4 electron transport material is 37 nm, reaching the highest efficiency of 16.29%, with a Voc of 1013 mV, a Jsc of 21.68 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.74. In addition, the average PCE is 15.75%, with a deviation of 0.52. The PCE distribution is shown in Fig. 4f, suggesting a good reproducibility of the PSCs. Notably, the optimized performance of PSCs employing TPE-PDI4 as the ETM rivals those of most of the PSCs using non-fullerenes ETMs with a similar device configuration. The PCBM-based device, under the same testing conditions, shows a comparable efficiency of 15.27%, with a Voc of 1022 mV, a Jsc of 20.60 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.73. The performance of the TPE-PDI4-based device is superior to that of PCBM-based device mainly in Jsc values, which might come from the more efficient electron extraction properties of the TPE-PDI4, as discussed in Fig. 3. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the TPE-PDI4-based device exhibit high responses ranging from 400 nm to 750 nm. The integrated Jsc from IPCE is about 20.5 mA cm−2, which is consistent with the result measured from J–V curves.

The J–V characteristics of the PSCs using TPE-PDI4 or PCBM by scanning from forward and reverse directions are shown in Fig. 4c (detailed data summarized in Table S2†), where little hysteresis is observed. It has been recognized that hysteresis comes from ion migration in the perovskite layer. Therefore, in our inverted PSC structure, the ion migration could be efficiently suppressed, indicating that TPE-PDI4 and perovskite do not penetrate into each other. Fig. 4e shows the stabilized output over time under a voltage bias of 0.81 V for PSCs employing TPE-PDI4 and PCBM as the ETM. A stabilized photocurrent of 19.87 mA cm−2 and a stable PCE of 16.10% are observed within 150 s. The PCBM-based device delivers a stabilized photocurrent of 18.46 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 15.05% in 150 s. These results further demonstrate the effectiveness of TPE-PDI4 as an efficient ETM for perovskite solar cells.
To explore other applications of TPE-PDI4, the performances of TPE-PDI4 as an interfacial layer to assist electron transport in perovskite solar cells were also investigated. The J–V curves of the devices in the absence and presence of TPE-PDI4 are presented in Fig. 5, and detailed data are summarized in Table 2. Fig. 5a shows the device configuration of ITO/P3CT-Na/Perovskite/TPE-PDI4/C60/BCP/Ag, in which C60 is the electron transporting layer as well as hole blocking layer, and BCP is the cathode modification layer for C60. TPE-PDI4 is spin-coated on the perovskite layer as a thin interfacial material layer. Obviously, devices with TPE-PDI4 show better performance than those without this layer (Fig. 5b). The photovoltaic performances of PSCs could be controlled by tuning the interlayer thickness, and 5 nm of TPE-PDI4 provides the corresponding device with the best efficiency of 18.78%, with a Jsc of 21.98 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1052 mV, and a high FF of 0.81. In contrast, devices without TPE-PDI4 exhibit a lower PCE of 16.56%, with a Jsc of 21.01 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1038 mV, and a FF of 0.76. Thus the TPE-PDI4 interfacial layer contributes to the enhanced Jsc and FF prominently, by enhancing the electron extraction from the perovskite to the C60 ETM. The IPCE spectrum of the champion device is shown in Fig. 5d. A high spectral response ranging from 400 nm to 750 nm is observed. The integrated current density derived from IPCE is 20.72 mA cm−2, consistent with the Jsc value (21.98 mA cm−2) measured from the J–V curves. The stabilized photocurrent and PCE output over time under a voltage bias of 0.90 V for PSCs containing the TPE-PDI4 interlayer are shown in Fig. S3.† It is observed that the champion device shows a stabilized photocurrent of 20.70 mA cm−2, and a stable power output of 18.63% within 150 s. Moreover, PCE statistics distribute in a narrow range (17.5–18.8%) and 75% of the cells show performances exceeding 18%, confirming the good reproducibility of these devices (Fig. S3†).

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to disclose the interfacial charge transport properties of PSCs with the TPE-PDI4 interlayer. EIS of the devices were measured at an applied voltage of 0.9 V under dark conditions, as shown in Fig. S5.† The inset depicts an equivalent circuit model consisting of the series resistance (Rs) and the charge transfer resistance (RCT) at the interfaces. Rs is correlated to internal series resistance, which is consistent for devices with the same architecture and fabrication procedures.43 Therefore, the differences in RCT are mainly from the interfacial resistance at perovskite/C60 and perovskite/TPE-PDI4/C60 interfaces. From Fig. S5,† the RCT of devices with the TPE-PDI4 interlayer is much smaller than that without the interlayer, revealing more efficient charge transfer in PSCs containing the TPE-PDI4 interlayer. The results agree well with the photovoltaic performances discussed above, and the improved electron extraction contributes to the enhanced FF.
The stability of the devices using TPE-PDI4 as the ETL was studied under ambient conditions. For comparison, the stability of the control device with PCBM ETL was also studied. The ambient stability was examined by storing the unencapsulated devices in air with a controlled humidity of about 35–40%. It turned out that devices under ambient conditions exhibit a significant decrease in PCE in 200 h. The efficiency of TPE-PDI4-based and PCBM-based devices show a 28% and a 51% decrease, respectively. This should be related to the differences between TPE-PDI4 and PCBM. To investigate the differences, water contact angles for TPE-PDI4 and PCBM-coated perovskite films are measured. As shown in Fig. 6, the contact angle for the perovskite/TPE-PDI4 surface is 92.9°, which is higher than that for the perovskite/PCBM surface (84.6°). The results suggest that TPE-PDI4 is more hydrophobic than PCBM, thus providing better device stability.

Conclusions
In summary, we systematically evaluated the potential of a TPE-PDI-based 3D small molecule (TPE-PDI4) in inverted perovskite solar cells. TPE-PDI4 shows compatible energy levels with perovskite, a good solution processability and a high electron mobility. Steady state and time-resolved PL decay experiments revealed an enhanced charge carrier quenching and electron extraction at the perovskite/TPE-PDI4 interface. When introduced as the electron transporting material, the corresponding PSCs exhibit a high PCE of 16.29%, which is slightly higher than PCBM under the same testing conditions. Moreover, TPE-PDI4 also served well as a thin interfacial layer, and the best efficiency of 18.78% is achieved. In contrast, a lower efficiency of 16.56% is obtained without the TPE-PDI4 interlayer. Additionally, TPE-PDI4 has a better water-resistibility than PCBM, which could more effectively protect the perovskite layer beneath, and thus provides a better stability for the PSCs. Therefore, TPE-PDI4 is able to serve as a promising alternative to replace PCBM in perovskite solar cells.
