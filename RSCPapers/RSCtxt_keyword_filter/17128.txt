    , Accepted 5th March 2015First published on 6th March 2015AbstractThe influence of the monomer's isomeric structure on the optical, electrochemical, charge transporting properties and photovoltaic performance of donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated polymers has been demonstrated for the first time by studying two D–A copolymers consisting of bis(3-octyloxy)phenyl)quinoxaline as the electron deficient unit and the two isomeric structures of thienothiophene (thieno[3,2-b]thiophene and thieno[2,3-b]thiophene) as the electron rich units. The drastic effect of incorporating two different isomeric structures on the polymer backbone of these copolymers, manifests in changes observed in their optical, electrochemical and charge transporting properties. In contrast, the overall photovoltaic performance of the copolymers is similar, but distinct differences in the device photocurrents occur. These differences were attributed to morphology variations rather than the balanced mobility ratio. For further developments in the field, the isomeric structures of different functional monomers should be considered in the designing of new materials with even superior performance.
1. Introduction
Polymeric semiconductors are materials where unique optical and electronic properties often originate from a tailored chemical structure.1,2 During the past few decades a vast number of conjugated polymers have been developed and various chemical modifications are used to engineer and optimize the physical and optoelectronic properties that suit their specific purpose.3,4 Two major methodologies are employed to fine tune the band gap and energy level alignment of conjugated polymers. One methodology relies on the donor–acceptor (D–A) approach and the other on the stabilization of the quinoid structure.5
Common monomer units which function as electron donors include the bridged biphenylenes and bithiophenes, benzodithiophenes, thienothiophenes, benzotrithiophenes, naphthodithiophenes, etc.6 On the other hand, the electron acceptor units used to construct D–A polymers possess at least one or more strong electron withdrawing groups, like an imine nitrogen, or a carboxyl unit. Typical electron deficient moieties are thiazole-, thiadiazole-, pyrazine- and annulated amide- or imide-based derivatives.7 Other parameters influencing the optoelectronic properties of polymeric semiconductors are the electron donating or electron accepting side groups, while side chains with different nature regarding length and branching, and their positioning onto the polymeric backbone are mostly employed to influence the regioregularity, through solid state packing, and solubility.8
Recently, many issues related to how the relative strength, the placement and the ratio of the donor and acceptor moieties in the backbone of D–A conjugated polymers influence the positioning of the HOMO, LUMO levels and as a consequence the electrochemical band gap, as well as the optical band gap have been addressed.9,10 However the critical issue of the effect of the monomer's isomeric structure on the optoelectronic properties and performance in different applications of various polymeric semiconductors has been poorly addressed. The most common electron rich building blocks, 4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene along with the silicon and germanium bridged analogues, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene and naphtha[2,3-b:6,7-b′]dithiophene (Fig. S1 in ESI†) are extensively used as the electron rich moieties for the development of new D–A conjugated polymers.11 However, the majority of the different isomeric structures of these monomers has been rarely employed (Fig. S1 in ESI†).
Very few examples have been reported studying the influence of the different isomeric structures on the optical, structural and transporting properties in fused polythiophene derivatives and all these examples are related to organic field effect transistors (OFETs). Müllen et al. compared five polythiophene derivatives containing different benzodithiophene isomers in OFETs.12 It has been shown that the optical gap increased with increasing curvature of the polymers. The more highly curved polymers possess reduced order in the film, whereas the less curved ones have too low solubility for processing. McCulloch, Heeney et al. have developed a series of quaterthiophene derivatives based on the two isomeric structures of thienothiophene (thieno[2,3-b]thiophene and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene) and various alkyl side chains and examined their structural conformation along with the OFET performance.13 A maximum mobility of 0.15 cm2 V−1 s−1 was found for T23 T quaterthiophene with decyl side chains. On the other hand, T32 T quaterthiophene derivatives exhibit higher structural order combined with increased backbone rigidity. This is reflected in mobilities as high as 0.72 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the tetradecyl-substituted T32 T quaterthiophene copolymer. Takimiya et al. have studied in detail the electronic properties of the four isomeric structures of fused naphthodithiophenes, as well as their polymeric analogues, and evaluated their performances in organic and polymeric FETs.14 The angular-naphthodithiophene-based polymers displayed lower HOMO levels and larger band gaps than their linear counterparts. The polymers with angular naphthodithiophenes, on the other hand, provided highly ordered structures with a very close π-stacking distance of 3.6 Å, whereas those with linear naphthodithiophenes had a very weak or no π-stacking order. As a result, the polymer bearing naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene, an angular-shaped naphthodithiophene, exhibited the highest mobility of ∼0.8 cm2 V−1 s−1 among the four polymers with isomeric naphthodithiophenes.14
Hitherto, no studies have been conducted on the effect of the monomers of isomeric structures in donor–acceptor copolymers in the organic photovoltaic performance. For this reason we present here, the design rules for and to demonstrate the synthesis of two donor–acceptor conjugated polymers consisting of quinoxaline as the electron withdrawing unit and the two isomeric forms of thienothiophene (T23 T and T32 T) as the electron rich units (Scheme 1). Our results highlight the influence of the isomeric structures of the thiophene-fused aromatic compounds on the optoelectronic properties and photovoltaic performance of the corresponding donor–acceptor polymeric semiconductors. The obtained electronic properties and photovoltaic performances for the two thienothiophene-alt-quinoxaline copolymers are compared and discussed using TQ1 polymer as a reference (inset in Scheme 1). TQ1 namely poly(2,3-bis-(3-octyloxyphenyl)quinoxaline-5,8-dyl-alt-thiophene-2,5-diyl) is the unfused thiophene analogue of T32TQ and T23TQ which can be easily synthesized,15 has a relatively high bandgap (1.7 eV) ideal for tandem solar cells and exhibits high PCE up to 7.0%.16 Very recently, the influence of the quinoxaline's side-chain geometry on the ability of the TQ1 to order as well as on the backbone conformation was presented in detail.17

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis
The D–A copolymers of Scheme 1 were synthesized by Stille aromatic cross-coupling polymerization utilizing tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (Pd2dba3) in 1% per mole and tri(o-tolyl)phosphine (P(o-tol)3), 2% per mole, as the catalytic system in toluene solution between the 5,8-dibromo-2,3-bis(3-(octyloxy)phenyl)quinoxaline (1) and the distannyl derivatives bearing either thiophene (2), thieno[3,2-b]thiophene; [T32 T] (3) and thieno[2,3-b]thiophene; [T23 T] (4). In this series of oligothiophene copolymers, the thiophene, T32 T and T23 T units constitute the electron rich units while the quinoxaline unit is the electron deficient moiety. The polymerization reactions were performed at 110 °C under an argon atmosphere for 48 h. After purification using Soxhlet extraction, the chloroform-soluble fractions of the TQ1, T32TQ and T23TQ copolymers exhibit molecular weights of Mn = 33000 g mol−1 (PDI = 2.6), 20000 g mol−1 (PDI = 2.0) and 20000 g mol−1 (PDI = 2.0), respectively as measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) based on monodispersed polystyrene standards. Copolymers T32TQ and T23TQ provide the same molecular weights (Mn) despite the fact that there are two different thienothiophene isomeric forms. The thermal stability of the copolymers is characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in a nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. S2 in ESI†). While TQ1 and T32TQ are stable up to 450 °C, T23TQ exhibits a 5% weight-loss at this temperature. After 450 °C all the copolymers are degraded.
2.2. Optical and electrochemical properties
The absorption spectra of co-polymers T23TQ, T32TQ and TQ1 in chloroform solution and as thin films are presented in Fig. 1, and the corresponding optoelectronic properties are summarized in Table 1. The incorporation of the two different isomeric forms of thienothiophene has a noticeable impact on the optical properties of the T23TQ and T32TQ, as shown in the absorption spectra of Fig. 2. While T23TQ exhibits pronounced double absorption peaks at 342 nm and 600 nm in solution, qualitatively similar to TQ1, T32TQ displays three absorption bands at 353 nm, 616 nm and 656 nm (Fig. 1a). The absorption peak of TQ1 at 600 nm can be attributed to a combination of the intramolecular D–A charge transfer (ICT) and the intermolecular interactions between the polymeric chains as upon heating at 100 °C the intermolecular interactions are prevented and a maximum absorption peak at 555 nm is observed which is assigned solely to ICT interactions.15,16 Similar to TQ1, the absorption peak of T23TQ at 600 nm can be assigned to a combination of the ICT and the intermolecular interactions, respectively. On the other hand, the absorption peak of T32TQ at 616 nm in solution can safely be assigned to the ICT interactions, whereas the higher absorption band at 656 nm could safely be attributed to vibronic transitions from the interchain interactions, similar to those observed for other conjugated polymers. Furthermore, the low-wavelength peak observed at 353 nm for T32TQ is situated at longer wavelengths than T23TQ (342 nm) showing that the selection of the T32 T provides enhanced conjugation in the polymer backbone.

Despite the fact that T23TQ and TQ1 reveal different molecular weights (Table 1) and different dihedral angles (Fig. S3 in ESI†), their absorption spectra are the same both in solution and in the solid state, as mentioned previously. The identical absorption spectra and the same optical band gap (Eoptg) of T23TQ and TQ1 are somehow surprising, since the simple DFT calculations (see Fig. S6 in ESI†) support a wider predicted band gap. The possible explanations are the differences in molecular backbone structures and the resonance structures of T23TQ and TQ1 or a combination of both. T23TQ exhibits a more linear backbone in comparison with TQ1 – which has a significant curvature (Fig. S6 in ESI†). In addition, the resonance structures of the copolymers are presented in Fig. 2. T23TQ demonstrates the same short conjugated segment as TQ1, due to the cross conjugation of T23 T along the polymer backbone, and therefore inhibits the full delocalization. In contrast, T32 T allows the full delocalization on T32TQ, hence T32TQ shows a longer conjugated segment as compared to T23TQ and TQ1 and a different absorption spectrum.
Upon a film formation the longer wavelength peak of T23TQ, T32TQ and TQ1 increases in intensity relative to the solution and slightly red-shifts indicative of enhanced interchain interactions (Fig. 1b). TQ1 and T23TQ exhibit a higher absorption coefficient (1 × 105 cm−1) at the maximum absorption peak as compared to T32TQ (9 × 104 cm−1). The absorption maxima of the copolymers as thin films are red shifted as compared to the solution. T23TQ and TQ1 exhibit absorption maxima at 627 nm, whereas T32TQ at 665 nm in the solid state. The optical band gaps, as measured by the onset of UV-Vis absorption in the solid state are 1.75 eV for T23TQ and TQ1, and 1.68 eV for T32TQ. Finally, the trend on the low-wavelength peaks of the copolymers in the solid state is the same as in solution. T23TQ and TQ1 exhibit an absorption peak at 365 nm while T32TQ at 379 nm. The absorption spectra of TQ1:PC70BM, T23TQ:PC70BM and T32TQ:PC70BM as thin films in various compositions (1:1, 1:2 and 1:3) were also recorded (Fig. S4 in ESI†). Upon addition of PC70BM the absorption coefficient of all systems decreases, even in a 1:1 ratio, as compared to pristine films (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the intensity of the low energy absorption maximum peak decreases for the TQ1 and T32TQ, while T23TQ seems to be insensitive due to the increment of the PC70BM content (Fig. S4†), whereas the absorption peak at around 500 nm (characteristic of the PC70BM18) increases in all cases.
The emission spectra of the copolymers in solution are presented in Fig. 1a. The emission spectra of T23TQ and TQ1 are identical in shape with the appearance of a maximum peak and a shoulder. However, the maximum emission peak at 671 nm and the shoulder at 722 nm of T23TQ are slightly red shifted as compared to TQ1 (667 nm the maximum emission peak and 715 nm the shoulder). On the other hand, T32TQ shows only a maximum emission peak at 695 nm without the appearance of a shoulder.
The energy levels of the copolymers were investigated by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in the thin film form. The reduction potentials of TQ1, T23TQ and T32TQ are shown in Fig. 3, while no obvious oxidation potentials appeared for all the copolymers. The reduction peak potentials of TQ1, T23TQ and T32TQ versus Fc/Fc+ are −1.64 V, −1.69 V and −1.53 V, respectively (Table 1) resulting in the estimated LUMO energy levels (ELUMO) of −3.49 eV (TQ1), −3.44 eV (T23TQ) and −3.60 eV (T32TQ) vs. vacuum as derived from the equation ELUMO = −5.1 + Eredpeak eV. Based on these results, we can realize that the selection of the different isomeric structure of thienothiophene (T23 T versus T32 T) significantly influences the ELUMO of these D–A copolymers, even though the electron accepting unit (quinoxaline) is the same. The incorporation of the cross conjugated T23 T in the polymer backbone leads to the upshifted LUMO level as compared to TQ1 and consequently to a lower electron affinity copolymer. However, the integration of the fully conjugated T32 T in the polymer backbone drives the LUMO level to deeper values, as compared to TQ1, and therefore to a higher electron affinity copolymer. The reduction potentials of PC60BM have been also determined by cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S5 in ESI†). The first reduction potential of PCBM is detected at −1.20 V versus Fc/Fc+, resulting in an ELUMO of −3.90 eV vs. vacuum. Thus, the ELUMO offset (α) between the PCBM and the copolymers is calculated and is 0.41 eV for TQ1, 0.46 eV for T23TQ and 0.30 eV for T32TQ (Table 1).

In order to gain more insight about the differences observed for the ELUMO of the copolymers, quantum chemical (DFT) calculations19 were performed to predict the molecular energy levels and model the distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals of the copolymers (Fig. S6 in ESI†). The calculated LUMO energy levels of the tetramers follow the same trend as the DPV. However distinct differences are observed in the shape of the molecular orbitals of the corresponding LUMO levels, which are related to the type of the thienothiophene isomeric form that is used. For example, the LUMO levels for both the model compounds of TQ1 and T32TQ assume a more quinoidal form as shown by the presence of orbital lobes in the bonds between the thiophene and quinoxaline (TQ1) and T32 T and quinoxaline (T32TQ) along with a significant localization of the LUMO on the quinoxaline unit. This orbital lobe pattern is similar to the HOMO of a series of thiophene oligomers that are quinoidal in the ground state.20 In contrast, the LUMO level of the model compound of T23TQ is mainly localized on the quinoxaline unit and the neighboring carbon atoms of T23 T. In this case the quinoidal form is absent. Therefore, it seems that in these quinoxaline based D–A copolymers, the use of thiophene or T32 T (which are short and fully conjugated) enables the formation of the quinoidal structure, whereas the use of T23 T (short and cross conjugated) prevents the formation of the quinoidal structure. As a conclusion, even if all the copolymers contain the same electron accepting unit (quinoxaline) and might be expected to show similar LUMO level values, the use of electron rich building blocks that contribute to the formation of the quinoidal structure on the LUMO levels results in D–A copolymers with enhanced electron affinities as compared to those electron rich monomers that prevent the formation of the quinoidal structure. Finally, it is possible to observe that in all three copolymers the HOMO level is fully delocalized along the polymer chain axis.
2.3. Structural (X-ray) characterization
The ordering of drop cast films of the polymers was investigated by X-ray scattering (XRD) as shown in Fig. 4. All polymers diffract rather weakly, but there are nevertheless distinct diffraction features in pure TQ1 and T23TQ films that are detected at 2θ = 4.21 Å, corresponding to a d-spacing of 21.0 nm. This diffraction peak in TQ1 has been attributed to an ordered lamellar packing motif with a presumably edge-on orientation.16 In contrast, there is no peak present for T32TQ which indicates a more amorphous structure. The combination of in and out of plane solubilising groups, as presented in Fig. S6 in ESI† for T32TQ, appears to frustrate the ordering of the polymer similar to the results presented elsewhere.21–23

2.4. Charge transporting properties

2.4.1. Transistor field-effect measurements. 
Bottom-gate, bottom-contact (BG/BC) field-effect transistors were fabricated in order to investigate the charge transport characteristics of this series of copolymers. The transistor architecture used together with representative sets of the transfer characteristics of these devices are shown in Fig. 5. All of the three pristine copolymers exhibited typical unipolar hole transporting (p-type) characteristics. The extracted hole mobility values measured in the saturation regime are 4.0 × 10−5 ± 3.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for TQ1, 3.0 × 10−5 ± 7.8 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for T23TQ and 3.7 × 10−7 ± 1.6 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1 for T32TQ. TQ1 and T23TQ yielded hole mobilities of the same order of magnitude, while T32TQ showed lowered mobility of about two orders of magnitude. The hole mobility results correlate well with the X-ray structural characterization, where T32TQ indicated a more disordered packing mode due to a disrupted and weaker interaction between the polymer chains.

2.4.2. Space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements. 
The charge transport properties of the pristine polymers and polymer:PC70BM blend films were also studied by utilizing the space charge limited current model. For each system, unipolar devices were fabricated and their dark J–V characteristics were recorded. For all systems studied, the carrier mobility values were determined based on the Mott–Gurney equation, by taking into account the Poole–Frenkel effect.24 The dark J–V curves are presented in Fig. S7 in ESI.†Table 2 summarizes the results of the charge transport characterization of all devices. The hole mobility of the pristine TQ1, T23TQ and T32TQ devices are calculated to be 4.5 × 10−4 ± 1.7 × 10−4, 5.3 × 10−10 ± 2.0 × 10−10 and 7.1 × 10−9 ± 6.1 × 10−9 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The hole mobilities of T23TQ and T32TQ polymers are found to be comparatively very low as compared to TQ1 and are different from the results obtained on FETs. One possible explanation is that the two techniques measure the mobility of the charge carriers parallel (FETs) and perpendicular (SCLC) to the substrate. As TQ1 and T23TQ presumably exhibit an “edge on” orientation their FET mobilities are higher than that of T32TQ in agreement with the XRD analysis. On the other hand, it is unclear whether the orientation of the polymer chains is perpendicular to the substrate, hence advanced crystallographic techniques like 2D-GIWAXS, SAXS should be performed in order to obtain a full understanding of polymer chain packing behaviour. Considering the case of the polymer:PC70BM blends, with increasing PC70BM content both hole and electron mobility of the systems are found to increase, except in the case of TQ1, where the hole mobility decreases by almost two orders of magnitude.25,26 This leads to more balanced hole and electron transport systems. Table 2 presents the extracted hole, electron mobility and the mobility ratios for the polymer:PC70BM blend systems in different compositions.

2.5. Photovoltaic performance
The photovoltaic properties of the TQ1:PC70BM, T23TQ:PC70BM and T32TQ:PC70BM systems were tested in conventional OPV devices with the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC70BM/Ca/Al geometry. For each polymer:PC70BM three different composition ratios (1:1, 1:2 and 1:3) were studied in order to identify the effect of increasing PC70BM content on the device performance. Fig. 6a–c present the photo J–V curves of these systems and Fig. 6d–f present the corresponding EQE spectra of these devices. Table 3 summarizes the findings of the electrical characterisation and presents the main output device characteristics of each system, that is the open circuit voltage (Voc), the short-circuit current density (Jsc), the fill factor (FF) and the power conversion efficiency (PCE).

The effect of increasing the PC70BM content is different in the three polymer:PC70BM OPV systems. Notably, the increase of PC70BM results in an increase of the PCE in the case of the TQ1:PC70BM system, where an average PCE of 5.7% and a maximum PCE of 6.6% are obtained for a composition ratio of 1:3. This result is in accordance with the PCE obtained by Wang et al.15 and Kim et al.16 The effect is different in the case of the T23TQ:PC70BM and the T32TQ:PC70BM. In the former, doubling the relative PC70BM content does not affect the device performance but for the 1:3 ratio the device efficiency decreases. A PCE of 5.0% is obtained for the T23TQ:PC70BM in a 1:2 ratio. In the T32TQ:PC70BM, doubling the relative PC70BM content is found to slightly increase the device PCE but for the 1:3 ratio the device efficiency is again reduced exhibiting device characteristics closer to the device with the 1:1 ratio. A maximum PCE of 5.0% is obtained for the T32TQ:PC70BM in a 1:2 ratio.
The results presented in Table 3 indicate that the observed trends in device performance of these systems are a consequence of the variation of the FF and the Jsc parameters of the cells as the polymer:PC70BM composition alters. It is very likely that the change of the PC70BM content influences the morphology of the OPV blend so that the charge carrier properties vary, hence the collection of the photogenerated charges is influenced accordingly. In addition, the change in the Jsc values for different PC70BM content implies that the amount of PC70BM in the blend results in changes in the charge carrier generation efficiency. The composition dependent device study of the T23TQ:PC70BM and T32TQ:PC70BM systems found that the optimum blending ratio for both systems is 1:2. Table 2 shows that with respect to the rest of the compositions tested, the hole/electron mobility ratio is balanced for the 1:2 mixing ratio. However by comparing the Jsc of the two systems at each composition, it is found that the T23TQ:PC70BM system outperforms the T32TQ:PC70BM system, regardless of how the charge transport is balanced in the blends.
Apart from the necessity for balanced charge transport, photocurrent generation depends also on the extent of phase separation between the polymer matrix and the PC70BM component. Extended phase separation of the blend components leads to inefficient exciton dissociation whereas fine mixing of the blend components is detrimental to the efficiency of full charge separation due to the prevalence of charge recombination. We have studied the surface topography of the TQ1:PC70BM, T23TQ:PC70BM and T32TQ:PC70BM blend films in their optimized composition ratio by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 7) and it is found that the T23TQ:PC70BM exhibits an optimum phase separation with the formation of domains of 5–10 nm size, similar to TQ1:PC70BM. In contrast the surface topography of the T32TQ:PC70BM suggests a larger degree of phase separation for the T32TQ and PC70BM components that results in the formation of larger size domains of 10–20 nm.

In each of the three systems when the mixing ratio is changed the device photocurrent is optimized because the mobility ratio is optimized. However this is not the case when different systems are compared. Therefore the comparison of the three different systems finds that the balanced mobility ratio is not the key-parameter that determines the efficiency of the device photocurrent. AFM images suggest that morphology variations in the three systems lead to different domain sizes that are likely to affect the process of charge photogeneration.
In agreement with the photo J–V curves, the EQE spectra in Fig. 6d–f show that the TQ1:PC70BM 1:3 exhibits the highest photocurrent generation efficiency among all the studied systems. According to the registered EQE spectra of all devices, both the polymer and PC70BM components contribute to the overall photocurrent generation efficiency. The EQE values are in full agreement with the device photocurrent measured under simulated solar illumination. We have calculated the expected Jsc values based on the registered external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the studied systems. Table S4 (ESI†) compares the experimentally determined Jsc values as recorded under simulated solar illumination with the corresponding values as calculated by the EQE spectra. An excellent agreement is found between the two Jsc values indicating that the recorded EQE spectra reflect realistic results. The device Voc remains nearly unaffected by the change in the polymer:PC70BM ratio used in each blend. In all cases the variation of the Voc values is below 8%.
3. Conclusions
In summary, isomeric series of thienothiophene containing D–A copolymers utilizing bis(3-octyloxy)phenyl)quinoxaline have been successfully synthesized by the Stille cross coupling polymerization procedure. By UV-vis spectroscopy, it has been shown that the optical gap of the cross-conjugated T23 T based copolymer is higher than that of the fully-conjugated T32 T and the absorption profiles of T23TQ are the same as TQ1 both in solution and in the solid state. T32TQ exhibits higher electron affinity than T23TQ due to the presence of the quinoid form along the LUMO level. T23 T enables the corresponding T23TQ to obtain a higher degree of structural order than T32 T in T32TQ with the appearance of a lamellar packing motif with a presumably edge-on orientation. The FET hole mobilities providing two orders of magnitude enhanced hole mobilities for the T23TQ as compared to T32TQ. The photovoltaic performance of T23TQ and T32TQ shows that both copolymers exhibit similar PCE of around 5.0% with a low loading of PC70BM, despite their differences in optical, electrochemical, structural and charge transporting properties. However, even if the maximum PCE of the two isomeric polymers is the same, distinct differences in device photocurrents occur that are primarily related to the different domain sizes of the blend films rather than the balanced mobility ratio.
4. Experimental section
All reactions were treated as air and light sensitive and performed under argon and in the dark. All glassware used were washed using the teepol surfactant, rinsed with excess water, acetone and methylene dichloride and dried in an oven at 120 °C. All solvents and reagents were sourced commercially from Aldrich. The synthesis of 5,8-dibromo-2,3-bis(3-(octyloxy)phenyl)quinoxaline, 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene, and 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thieno[2,3-b]thiophene were performed according to the previously reported literature.27–29
4.1. Synthesis of TQ1
2,5-Bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene (0.5 mmol, 204.88 mg) and 5,8-dibromo-2,3-bis(3-(octyloxy)phenyl)quinoxaline (0.5 mmol, 348.29 mg) were dissolved in dry toluene (25 mL). Then, tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (Pd2dba3) (0.005 mmol, 4.58 mg) and tri(o-tolyl)phosphine (P(o-tol)3) (0.01 mmol, 3.04 mg) were added and the reaction mixture was stirred at 110 °C under an argon atmosphere for 17 h.

The 1H-NMR and GPC profile are presented in the ESI file (Fig. S9 and Fig. S10 in ESI†).
4.3. Synthesis of T32TQ
2,5-Bis(trimethylstannyl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (0.5 mmol, 232.92 mg) and 5,8-dibromo-2,3-bis(3-(octyloxy)phenyl)quinoxaline (0.5 mmol, 348.29 mg) were dissolved in dry toluene (25 mL). Then, Pd2dba3 (0.005 mmol, 4.58 mg) and P(o-tol)3) (0.005 mmol, 3.04 mg) were added and the reaction mixture was stirred at 110 °C under an argon atmosphere for 17 h. Then, the toluene solution was evaporated, and the mixture was solubilised in CHCl3. The polymer was purified by precipitation in acetone, filtered and washed on Soxhlet apparatus with methanol, hexane and chloroform. The chloroform fraction was evaporated under reduced pressure and the polymer was precipitated in acetone, filtered and finally dried under high vacuum, providing a dark blue solid with 81% of yield. The 1H-NMR and GPC profile are presented in the ESI file (Fig. S9 and S10 in ESI†).
4.4. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV-400 (400 MHz for 1H and 100 MHz for 13C), using the residual solvent resonance of CDCl3 as an internal reference.
4.5. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC)
Molecular weights (Mn and Mw) were determined by GPC (ultrastyragel columns with 500 and 104 Å pore size; CHCl3 (analytical grade) was filtered through a 0.2 μm Millipore filter; flow 1 mL min−1; room temperature) using narrow polystyrene standards for calibration.
4.6. Thermogravimetric analysis
The thermogravimetric analysis was performed using a TGA Q500 V20.2 Build 27 instrument by TA in an inert atmosphere of nitrogen. In a typical experiment 2 mg of the material was placed in the sample pan and the temperature was equilibrated at 40 °C. Subsequently, the temperature was increased to 800 °C with a rate of 10 °C min−1 and the weight changes were recorded as a function of temperature.
4.7. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV)
Electrochemistry studies were performed by using a standard three-electrode cell. Platinum wire was used as a pseudo-reference electrode, platinum disk 1.6 mm diameter was used as a working electrode and platinum, 52 mesh, was used a counter electrode. TBAPF6 (98%) was used as the electrolyte and was recrystallized three times from acetone and dried in a vacuum at 100 °C. Before each experiment the cell was purged with high purity N2 for 5 min. Before the start of the measurement the inert gas was turned to “blanket mode”. Measurements were recorded by using an EG&G Princeton Applied Research potentiostat/galvanostat Model 2273 connected to a personal computer running PowerSuite software. The working electrode was cleaned before each experiment through polishing using a cloth and 6, 3, and 1 mm diamond pastes. DPV experiments were performed by using pulse PH/PW: 0.025 V per 20 ms, step time 40 ms and a scan rate 50 mV s−1. All measurements were taken at room temperature and were calibrated by using ferrocene as the internal standard.
4.8. Theoretical calculations
All calculations of the model compounds studied in this work have been performed using the Gaussian 03 software package.19 The octyloxy substituents anchored onto the peripheral phenyl rings of quinoxaline have been replaced with methoxy groups in the model compounds for our calculations. While the presence of these long alkyl chains enhances the solubility of these polymers and affects the charge carrier mobility and photovoltaic behavior of the polymer,30 from a computational point of view their replacement with shorter chains does not affect their optoelectronic properties (HOMO, LUMO and band gap) and thus the optimized structures of the molecules.31 The ground-state geometry of each model compound has been determined by a full geometry optimization of its structural parameters using the DFT, upon energy minimization of all possible isomers. In this work, the DFT calculations were performed using the Becke's three-parameter hybrid functional, B3, with non-local correlation of Lee–Yang–Parr, LYP, abbreviated as B3LYP in conjunction with the 6-31G(d,p) split valence polarized basis set. All calculations were performed in a vacuum. No symmetry constraints were imposed during the optimization process. The geometry optimizations have been performed with a tight threshold that corresponds to root mean square (rms) residual forces smaller than 10−5 au for the optimal geometry. The energy levels of the HOMO and the LUMO of the repetitive units of each polymer were carried out by using the same set of calculations. DFT/B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) has been found10c to be an accurate formalism for calculating the structural and electronic properties of many molecular systems. In our studies the theoretical calculations have been performed on tetramer model compounds. The visualization of the molecular orbitals has been performed using GaussView 5.0.
4.9. Solution and thin film prepration
The solutions of the polymer (either TQ1 or T23TQ or T32TQ): phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) blend were prepared in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) solvent in a N2-filled glovebox. Three different compositions were tested; 1:1 (22 mg mL−1), 1:2 (24 mg mL−1) and 1:3 (28 mg mL−1). The solutions were stirred for 48 hours at 100 °C to get a clear solution and were deposited by spin-coating on quartz subsrates for spectroscopic studies. Surface profilometry (Bruker, D150) was used for determining the film thickness and for optimizing the thickness of the blend films.
4.10. Time integrated UV absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy
UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence spectra of the blend films were recorded using a Perkin Elmer, Lambda 1050 spectrometer and a Horiba Jobin Yvon NanoLog spectrofluorimeter, respectively.
4.11. X-Ray characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on the PANALYTICAL X′ PERT-PRO MRD diffractometer equipped with a nickel-filtered Cu Kα1 beam and X′ CELERATOR detector, using current I = 40 mA and accelerating voltage V = 40 kV. Samples were prepared by drop casting.
4.12. Organic field effect transistor (OFET) fabrication
Fraunhofer substrates, bottom gate/bottom contact architecture with ∼230 nm n-doped SiO2 as gate dielectric, were cleaned with acetone, water and isopropanol for 15 min, respectively, under ultrasonication. The substrates were blow dried with nitrogen before being treated with UV ozone for 15 min. The substrates were then modified with hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS). The polymers were dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene by stirring for 48 h at 100 °C to reach the concentration of 16 mg mL−1 for TQ1, 20 mg mL−1 for T23Q and 20 mg mL−1 for T32Q. The semiconductor layer was then spin coated from the polymer solution at 900 rpm for 120 s at room temperature. The solvent residue was removed under vacuum before the devices were tested with an Agilent B2902A source/measure unit. The channel width and length of the transistors are 10 mm and 10 μm, respectively. The mobility was extracted from the slope of ID1/2vs. VG.
4.13. Space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements
Single carrier devices with photoactive layers were prepared in an identical fashion as in the case of the OPV devices. Electron-only devices were prepared using electrodes of glass/ITO/ZnO and Ca/Al, whereas hole only devices were prepared using electrodes of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS and Au. Dark J–V characteristics of the fabricated single carrier devices were recorded with a 2440 Keithley source-measure unit. The determination of the charge carrier mobility for each device was based on the space charge limited current mode like previously described.24
4.14. Solar cell fabrication and characterization
Solar cell devices were fabricated by depositing a 90 nm-thick polymer:PC70BM blend films onto glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrensulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) substrates by spin-coating in a N2-filled glovebox. Prior to PEDOT:PSS deposition, the ITO substrates (Xin Yan Technology Ltd, sheet resistance – 15 Ω per square) were ultrasonically cleaned using acetone and isopropanol. They were then treated with the Hellmanex III surfactant to remove contaminants and residues from the ITO surface and were cleaned again with succesive 15 min-long cycles of ultrasonication in deionized water, acetone and isopropanol. The cleaned ITO susbtrates were oxygen plasma etched at 100 W for 10 min and a 40 nm thick PEDOT:PSS layer was deposited by spin coating in air. The glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS film was dried in air at 150 °C for 30 minutes. Following the deposition of the polymer:PC70BM photoactive layers the metal electrode of Ca/Al was deposited by thermal evaporation in a vacuum (1 × 10−6 m bar) onto the top of photoactive film by using a prepatterned shadow mask. The obtained OPV devices were encapsulated with degassed epoxy and 1 mm thick glass slides inside the N2-glove box. The electrical characterization of the solar cell devices was performed by means of current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics recorded under simulated solar light (AM1.5G, 0.98 Sun) and by registering the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra under monochromated light. For each system at least four to six devices were characterized for confirming the reproducibility of the obtained results.
4.15. Atomic force microscopy (AFM)
AFM images were obtained using a Picoscan PicoSPM LE scanning probe in the tapping mode under ambient conditions. Thin films of polymer blends were fabricated following identically the same procedure as the OPV device fabrication, except that the evaporation of electrodes was not performed.
