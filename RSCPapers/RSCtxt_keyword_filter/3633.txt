    , Accepted 20th April 2015First published on 5th May 2015AbstractTi3+-doped amorphous TiO2 nanoparticles (a-TiO2:Ti3+), which are an intermediate band semiconductor, were fabricated by high intensity ultraviolet pulsed laser ablation in water. The absorption band of a-TiO2:Ti3+ nanoparticles, which appears between the visible and infrared regions, is much wider than that of the rutile TiO2 nanoparticles. The intermediate band, which has a recombination lifetime of 0.71 μs, is found to be 1.61 eV above the valence band (VB) top of TiO2. It can be shown that the a-TiO2:Ti3+/TiO2 nanotube hybrid dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) not only have a high fill factor and large open circuit voltage, but also have high photovoltaic conversion efficiency as compared to TiO2 nanotube DSSCs. Considering that most of the current solar cells use only a single photoelectric conversion material (PCM), our results will promote the research on multi-PCM hybrid solar cells.
Introduction
Harvesting solar energy is one of the most interesting approaches towards fulfilling the need for a clean energy supply and environment depuration.1 The intermediate band (IB) materials, such as GaNxAs1−x alloy,2 Sn-doped chalcopyrites,3 O-incorporated ZnTe,4,5 and V-substituted In2S3,6 have recently evoked a lot of interest because of their wide absorption spectrum and greatly enhanced photocatalysis, water splitting and photovoltaic performance.4–12 The partially filled intermediate states can act as a ladder, upon which the sub-band gap photons are absorbed through the transition from the valence band (VB) to the IB and from the IB to the conduction band (CB).10,13 The solar response of IB materials can extend to a long wavelength region, especially to near-infrared (NIR) areas, and thus can provide wide range absorption in the solar spectrum from visible to infrared. For example, the efficiency of the IB solar cells is anticipated up to 63.2%, which exceeds the 41% efficiency limit for single junction solar cells.13
As a well-known “solar material”, TiO2 has been widely applied for solar energy conversion and environment circulation, such as in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), hydrogen generation of water photolysis, and photodegradation of pollutions. Due to the wide band gap (3.0 eV for rutile and 3.2 eV for anatase) TiO2 absorbs only a small portion of the solar spectrum in the ultraviolet region. Doping is the most accepted strategy to extend the spectral response of TiO2, and various metal ions and nonmetallic elements, such as Fe, N, C, S, have been explored.1,14–19 Through doping, the absorption efficiency of TiO2 in the visible light range has been evidently enhanced. The absorption edge and band gap generally red-shift to the visible light region upon doping, the absorption in the NIR region is still feeble and the stability of the doped TiO2 is not satisfactory. Because of wide optical absorption spectra, high absorption efficiency and stability, melanocratic Ti3+-doped TiO2, such as black and smalt, has also attracted enormous attention for high performance hydrogen generation,20–22 photocatalysis23 and chemical sensing applications.24 Very recently, the disorder engineering has been theoretically proposed as a fantabulous route to enhance the absorption efficiency of TiO2 in the visible and NIR range through introduction of the mid-gap states.25 Nevertheless, clear experimental evidence on the existence of the intermediate band states in doped TiO2 is lacking, and the implementation of the IB states in TiO2 is still a challenge.
In this study, the IB states have been engineered in amorphous Ti3+-doped TiO2 (hereafter referred as a-TiO2:Ti3+) via a pulsed laser irradiation technique. We found that long-time and high-intensity ultraviolet laser irradiation can induce a complete transformation of crystalline TiO2 nanoparticles to an amorphous state. The dye-sensitized hybrid solar cells based on the a-TiO2:Ti3+ nanoparticle-grafted TiO2 nanotube array show a high fill factor, a large open circuit voltage and a high photovoltaic conversion efficiency compared with simple TiO2 nanotube dye-sensitized solar cells, demonstrating that the a-TiO2:Ti3+ can act as a new intermediate band material for solar cell applications.
Results and discussions
The a-TiO2:Ti3+ nanoparticles were prepared by a 355 nm ultraviolet pulsed laser ablation of TiO2 nanoparticles in water. After laser ablation the TiO2 nanoparticles completely transform into amorphous TiO2 nanoparticles (a-TiO2:Ti3+ nanoparticles), as shown in Fig. 1(a). The existence of Ti4+ and Ti3+ in a-TiO2:Ti3+ has been proved by an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiment.24 According to the XPS quantitative analysis, the amount ratio of Ti3+/(Ti3+ + Ti4+) is about 13.8%, as shown in Fig. S1(b) and Table S2 in the ESI.† The percentage of Ti3+ states is close to the values reported by Cottineau.26 The existence of Ti3+ was further confirmed by an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiment at 100 K, as shown in ESI Fig. S1.† The line shape of an EPR signal is Lorentzian type with a g-factor around 1.927, which is consistent with the value reported by Cottineau and Pattier, respectively.27,28

The AM 1.5G solar spectrum is drawn as the background in (b). The inset in (b) shows the Tauc plot (αhν)2 ∼ hν for the a-TiO2:Ti3+ and rutile TiO2 nanoparticles. 
The light absorption of rutile TiO2 nanoparticles, a-TiO2:Ti3+ nanoparticles and a-TiO2:Ti3+-grafted TiO2 nanotubes (NTs) was deduced from the corresponding UV-Vis-NIR diffuse reflection spectra based on the modified Kubelka–Munk function of F(R) = (1 − R)2/(2R) = α/S, where R is the reflectance, and α and S are the absorption of scattering coefficients,3 as shown in Fig. 1(b). For rutile TiO2 nanoparticles without UV laser illumination, the absorption spectrum shows a semiconductor feature with an absorption threshold of about 410 nm and a low absorption in the visible and NIR wavelength ranges, as shown in curve (1) of Fig. 1(b), which is consistent with results obtained for rutile TiO2 nanoparticles.29 However, for the a-TiO2:Ti3+ nanoparticles there appears a wide absorption band at 670–880 nm, as shown in curve (2). This result indicates that the visible and NIR spectral response of the a-TiO2:Ti3+ can be enhanced substantially.
The band gap transition between the VB maximum (VBM) and the CB minimum (CBM) of a-TiO2:Ti3+ can be evidently distinguished with the intermediate band transition. The absorption edge of the a-TiO2:Ti3+ nanoparticles can be analyzed according to the Tauc equation:30 (1)where a, α and Eg are a proportionality coefficient, the absorption coefficient, and the optical band gap of a-TiO2:Ti3+, respectively. The coefficient n can be assigned the values 2.0 and 0.5 for an authorized direct and indirect transition, respectively. Rutile is the most stable and dense state of the TiO2 polymorphs. Optical absorption measurements have revealed that rutile TiO2 has a direct band gap with a gap energy of 3.0 eV.29,31,32 By Tauc plotting, the direct optical band gap of the a-TiO2:Ti3+ nanoparticles is determined to be 3.04 eV at the intercept of the linear part of the curve with (αhν)2 = 0, as shown in the inset in Fig. 1(b). The immovability of band gap and absorption edge in the a-TiO2:Ti3+ nanoparticles is different from those previously reported for other doped TiO2, in which the absorption edge and band gap show a red-shift after doping. The high and broad absorption around 670–880 nm is associated with the absorption of extra photons of the VBM → IB and IB → CBM transition, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 2(b).

The photoluminescence (PL) measurement is an effective method to understand the band structures of IB semiconductors.3–5 To explore the intermediate band, the PL spectra of rutile TiO2 and a-TiO2:Ti3+ nanoparticles in the wavelength range between 330 and 950 nm under the excitation of 310 nm are recorded, and the results are shown in Fig. 2(a). An emission peak predominantly at 410 nm (∼3.02 eV) was found for the a-TiO2:Ti3+ nanoparticles, corresponding to the recombination between the CB and VB of the a-TiO2:Ti3+ nanoparticles, which is well consistent with the optical band gap of 3.04 eV shown in Fig. 1, and the divergence of about 0.02 eV is due to Stokes shift. Rutile TiO2 is a direct band gap semiconductor, but the dipole transition between conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) is forbidden which is due to the same parity symmetry of CB and VB wavefunction.33,34 The wavefunction symmetry depends on the lattice symmetry, which can be altered after transition from the ordered state (crystalline) to the disordered state (amorphous). The dipole forbidden property of rutile TiO2 will be lost due to the change of wavefunction symmetry in amorphous states. As a result, the strong luminescence between CB and VB can be observed in amorphous TiO2.
An extra weak emission at 770 nm (about 1.61 eV) can only be observed in the a-TiO2:Ti3+ nanoparticles, which is considered to have originated from the recombination from the IB to the VB. With the increase of laser irradiation time, the emission intensity at 770 nm increases slightly for the a-TiO2:Ti3+ nanoparticles. This indicates that there is an increase in the concentration of IB, as shown in the inset in Fig. 2(a). However, the emission peaks at 410 and 770 nm show no wavelength shift with the varying excitation wavelength (ESI Fig. S3†). These two emission peaks at 410 and 770 nm are attributed to the band-to-band transitions from CB to VB and from IB to VB respectively, as shown schematically in Fig. 2(b). On the other hand, the oxygen vacancy defect-related emission peak at ∼680 nm in pristine TiO2 shifts with different excitation wavelengths, as shown in ESI Fig. S4,† which is consistent with the literature.35
The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) is an effective method to probe the photocarrier dynamics process in semiconductors.36Fig. 3 shows the typical TRPL curves of the rutile TiO2 nanoparticles and a-TiO2:Ti3+ nanoparticles irradiated for 300 min. The PL decay profile, I(t), versus time, t, can be fitted by an equation with two exponential functions, (2)where τ1 and τ2 denote the decay times for the faster and the slower components, and A1 and A2 are the PL amplitudes. The dominant faster lifetimes τ1 for rutile TiO2 and a-TiO2:Ti3+ nanoparticles are all about 0.49 ns and are attributed to the instrument response. The slower lifetimes τ2 are about 33 ns and 26 ns for TiO2 and a-TiO2:Ti3+ nanoparticles, respectively, which are very close to the reported value of 24 ns for a TiO2 single crystal,36 as shown in Fig. 3(a). The IB emission at 770 nm for the a-TiO2:Ti3+ nanoparticles displays a very slow recombination process with a lifetime of 710 ns, as shown in Fig. 3(b), which is well consistent with the reported value observed in other intermediate band semiconductors, such as ZnTe:O thin films.4

(b) Emission at 770 nm from the intermediate band of a-TiO2:Ti3+ nanoparticles. The solid lines are fitting curves using eqn (2). The illumination time is 20 min for the PL decay measurement. 
XPS is a powerful tool to investigate the electronic band position of materials.22,26Fig. 4 shows the XPS spectra of rutile TiO2 and a-TiO2:Ti3+ nanoparticles, in which the adventitious C 1s peak was set to 284.8 eV for charge correction. The valence band maximum (VBM) is estimated by a linear extrapolation of the peak to the baseline. The a-TiO2:Ti3+ have a band edge position of 2.43 eV below the Fermi energy. The band edge of rutile TiO2 is slightly lower (ca. 0.1 eV) than that of the a-TiO2:Ti3+ due to the increased Fermi level caused by the n-type doping from the Ti3+ species37 in a-TiO2:Ti3+. Since the optical band gap of the a-TiO2:Ti3+ is 3.04 eV, the CBM should be at 0.61 eV. However, from Fig. 4(b) an intermediate band located at 0.8 eV between the Fermi level (binding energy: 0 eV) and the top of the VB can be clearly observed, providing a solid evidence of the existence of an intermediate band in a-TiO2:Ti3+. There is no clear observation of electronic states in the range of −1 to 2 eV for pristine TiO2. The existence of intermediate band electronic states within the band gap is further proved by the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), as shown in ESI Fig. S5.† The formation of the intermediate state, which has been theoretically proposed recently by Liu et al.,25 can be attributed to the lattice disorder in the a-TiO2:Ti3+.

Scanlon and co-workers demonstrated that a type-II and staggered band alignment of about 0.4 eV exists between anatase and rutile.29 The band diagram of rutile a-TiO2:Ti3+ and anatase TiO2 NTs is schematically shown in Fig. 5(a). The partially-filled intermediate band can receive electrons from VBM pumped by photon (i.e. process (1) in Fig. 5(a)), and then the electrons are pumped to CBM by photon (i.e. process (2) in Fig. 5(a)). The solar response is significantly extended to lower energy photons, especially in the NIR region. The type-II band alignment facilitates the photogenerated conduction electrons flowing from rutile a-TiO2:Ti3+ to anatase TiO2 NTs.

Fig. 5(b) shows schematically the fabrication process of a-TiO2:Ti3+-grafted TiO2 nanotube (NT) array DSSCs. TiO2 NTs were soaked in a-TiO2:Ti3+ colloidal solution for a certain time interval. To improve the interface wetting, the a-TiO2:Ti3+ solution containing TiO2 NTs was illuminated under a UV lamp.38 The hydrophilic TiO2 NTs facilitate the surface adsorption of a-TiO2:Ti3+ nanoparticles, as shown in ESI Fig. S6.† The absorption spectra of TiO2 NTs and a-TiO2:Ti3+-grafted TiO2 NTs are shown in ESI Fig. S7.†
The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the a-TiO2:Ti3+/TiO2 NT hybrid solar cells with different soaking times in a-TiO2:Ti3+ colloidal solutions are shown in Fig. 6(a) and Table 1. One can see that the open circuit voltage (Voc) of the hybrid solar cells increases substantially for all the soaking times accompanied by an apparent enhancement in the fill factor (FF) value compared with that of TiO2 NT DSSCs. The Voc first increases from 0.72 V for a TiO2 NT DSSC to 0.77 V for the hybrid solar cell soaked for 10 min, and then slightly decreases with increasing soaking time (to 0.75 V for 60 min soaking) and finally remains at a constant value with further increase in soaking time. The increase in Voc can be attributed to a higher quasi-Fermi level of the a-TiO2:Ti3+ nanoparticles as compared with anatase TiO2 nanotubes, as shown in Fig. 5(a). The FF also increases from 0.59 for the TiO2 NT DSSC to 0.7 for the hybrid solar cell with soaking for 10 min, with an increment of about 19%. The FF of the hybrid solar cell slightly decreases with the increase in the soaking time, but is still higher than that of the TiO2 NT DSSC. The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) provides further evidence of the enhancement of the photocurrent in the wavelength range from 520 nm to 700 nm, as shown in ESI Fig. S8,† which is due to the intermediate band absorption under the same dye loading concentration. The IPCE was reduced from 400 to 460 nm in a-TiO2:Ti3+/TiO2 nanotube solar cells. As a result, the integrated areas (S, correlated with the total photocurrent) of IPCE with and without a-TiO2:Ti3+ decoration are close to each other (STiO2 NTs/Sa-TiO2:Ti3+/TiO2 NTs = 0.98). This is consistent with the variation of short circuit current density Jsc in Table 1 (JTiO2 NTs/Ja-TiO2:Ti3+/TiO2 NTs = 1.1). The short circuit photocurrent density Jsc slightly decreases for all the hybrid solar cells due to the recombination process caused by the amorphous a-TiO2:Ti3+. The lifetime of electrons on the conduction band in a-TiO2:Ti3+ is 26 ns, which is shorter than that on the conduction band in anatase TiO2 of 50 ns.36 The fast radiative recombination (luminescence) in a-TiO2:Ti3+ is due to the short lifetime that will reduce the photocurrent. Although the lifetime of electrons at intermediate states is long, those electrons at the intermediate band are not extended due to the Anderson localization effect.39 Only the extended state electrons on the conduction band contribute to the photocurrent. Because of the enhancement in both Voc and FF, the overall photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) of the hybrid solar cell reaches a maximum value of 5.19% by soaking for 30 min in a-TiO2:Ti3+ solution.

To obtain the information about the interfacial characteristics of the photoelectrodes, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements are employed to investigate the recombination processes of DSSCs. The Nyquist curves of the EIS results are shown in Fig. 6(b). The inset in Fig. 6(b) illustrates the equivalent circuit simulated to fit the impedance spectroscopy. The data are numerically fitted by the equivalent circuit with the fitted parameters listed in Table 2. The electron lifetime can be estimated by two routes: (1) τR2×C2 = R2 × C2, and (2) τ1/2πfmax = 1/(2πfmax), and the fmax is the corresponding peak frequency of the mid-frequency semicircle. From Fig. 6(b) one can see that both the charge transfer resistance R1 for the electron transfer process at the counter-electrode/electrolyte interface (high frequency range, left semicircle) and chemical capacitance (C1) of the hybrid solar cells are generally smaller than those of pure TiO2 NT DSSCs. The recombination resistance (R2), which is associated with the charge transfer process across the interface, increases after being grafted with a-TiO2:Ti3+. The increase in R2 can be ascribed to the existence of amorphous a-TiO2:Ti3+ on TiO2 NTs which acts as trap states for electrons. The enhancement of FF can be attributed to the increase in recombination resistance after grafting with a-TiO2:Ti3+ nanoparticles. The high recombination resistance R2 will spatially separate photogenerated charges, inhibiting their recombination across the interface between a-TiO2:Ti3+ nanoparticles and dye molecules, and thus leading to an increased fill factor. The same mechanism has also been observed in colloidal PbS quantum dot solar cells.40 However, the fitted capacitance and resistance exhibit abnormal behavior for the soaking time longer than 120 min. The possible reason may be the different electrochemical cell structures. Due to a large amount of a-TiO2:Ti3+ nanoparticles loaded on TiO2 NTs after long soaking time, the excessive a-TiO2:Ti3+ nanoparticles will directly make contact with the electrodes to act as the photoanodes, which is different from the proposed hybrid DSSC structure shown in Fig. 5.

Conclusion
In conclusion, a-TiO2:Ti3+ has been facilely fabricated by pulsed laser ablation of rutile TiO2 in water. The blue color appearance of the a-TiO2:Ti3+ provides direct evidence of the enhancement in the visible light absorption compared with pristine TiO2. There is a partially filled intermediate band in the a-TiO2:Ti3+ nanoparticles located at 1.61 eV with a lifetime of 0.71 μs above VBM as determined by XPS, steady-state and time-resolved PL measurements. The DSSCs based on the a-TiO2:Ti3+ nanoparticle-grafted TiO2 nanotube array show a high fill factor, a large open circuit voltage and a high photovoltaic conversion efficiency when compared with those of the simple TiO2 nanotube DSSCs. These verified that the a-TiO2:Ti3+ can act as a new intermediate band material for solar cell applications.
Methods
Fabrication of Ti3+-doped TiO2 nanoparticles
5–50 mg of commercially available rutile TiO2 nanoparticles (Aladdin Industrial Corporation, 99.8%, with an average diameter of 60 nm) was poured into a glass bottle containing 5 mL DI water and stirred for 5 min. A pulsed laser beam (Nd:YAG, 6 ns, 10 Hz) with a wavelength of 355 nm, a beam diameter of 5 mm and laser energy fluence of 1 J per pulse cm2 was irradiated onto the mixture of TiO2 and water. After 10 min of irradiation, the color of the mixture turned dark blue. The absorptance evolution of the blue “transparent” colloidal solutions at 750 nm wavelength with laser irradiation was employed to calibrate the transformation of TiO2 to a-TiO2:Ti3+, as shown in ESI Fig. S9.† We define the complete transformation of TiO2 to a-TiO2:Ti3+ when the absorptance at 750 nm reaches maximum.
Characterization
UV-Vis-NIR spectra were obtained by a diffused reflection method with a spectrometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu Ltd.) using BaSO4 as the standard background. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (ESCALAB 250, Thermo-VG Scientific, pass energy: 30.0 eV) was used to determine the VB spectra with calibration of the C 1s peak (284.81 eV). For XPS measurement, the a-TiO2:Ti3+ nanoparticles were separated from the colloidal solutions by vacuum filtration, and then the slurry was carefully dried at 80 °C in the oven under the protection of Ar gas for 24 hours. The steady and time-resolved photoluminescence spectra were collected by Fluorolog-3 and IBH-TEMPRO-01 (Horiba Jobin Yvon), respectively.
Fabrication and characterization of solar cells
TiO2 nanotubes were fabricated in a two-electrode electrochemical cell through potentiostatic anodization. Ti foil (0.125 mm in thickness, Strem Chemicals, Newburyport, MA, USA) was used as the working electrode and Pt foil as the counter electrode.41 Firstly, the Ti foil was pretreated for 0.5 h at 60 V in an ethylene glycol electrolyte containing 0.5 wt% NH4F and 3 vol% H2O. After being peeled off by intense ultrasonication to expose the substrate, the pretreated Ti was processed in the electrolyte at 60 V for about 1 h. The as-grown nanotubes were annealed at 200 °C for 2 h and then peeled from the Ti foil by anodization at 60 V in the electrolyte to obtain the freestanding membranes with both ends open.
The freestanding membranes were adhered to the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate with a TiO2 nanoparticle paste via a doctor-blade method. The photoanodes were sintered at 450 °C for 2 h, and then were soaked in the Ti3+-doped TiO2 nanoparticle solutions (concentration: 0.8 mg mL−1) for different durations under the irradiation of an 8 W ultraviolet lamp (365 nm). The pretreated photoanodes were soaked in a dye-containing solvent (N719 dye, 0.3 mM in ethanol, Dyesol, Queanbeyan, New South Wales, Australia) for 2 days. A H2PtCl6 isopropanol solution was thermal decomposited on FTO glass followed by annealing at 380 °C for 30 min to prepare the counter electrodes. Then the 25 μm-thick hot-melt spacer was used by filling the interspaces with a liquid electrolyte of DMPII/LiI/I2/TBP/GuSCN in 3-methoxypropionitrile.
The active area of the solar cells was 0.16 cm2 (defined by a template). A mask was added during the measurement. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured by a source meter (Model 2420, Keithley Instruments, Inc., Cleveland, OH, USA) under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) provided by a 300 W solar simulator (Model 91160, Newport Corporation-Oriel Instruments, Irvine, CA, USA). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was acquired with an IPCE system equipped with a xenon lamp (Oriel 66902, 300 W), a monochromator (Newport 66902), and a dual-channel power meter (Newport 2931-C) with a Si detector (Oriel 76175_71580). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in the darkness at a bias voltage of 0.68 V with the CHI 660C electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, USA). The magnitude of the alternative signal is 10 mV and the frequency ranges from 10−1 to 105 Hz.
