    , Accepted 18th May 2017First published on 18th May 2017AbstractIn this research work, new types of ruthenium sensitizers used in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), named S3 and S4, consisting of carbazole–diazafluorene based bipolar ancillary ligands, have been synthesized and characterized by 1H NMR, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. The energy levels and band gaps of the sensitizers were evaluated using electrochemical measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Both sensitizers show blue shifted low energy metal to ligand charge transfer bands, which could be ascertained from the relatively large dihedral angle between the secondary electron donor (carbazole) and acceptor (4,5-diazafluorene) units. The frontier molecular orbital surfaces obtained from DFT calculations revealed that the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of both sensitizers are dominantly populated on the secondary electron donor carbazole antenna, indicating the increased spatial separation of the HOMO away from the TiO2 surface. The DSSC fabricated using sensitizer S4 exhibited a higher photon-to-current conversion efficiency (2.11%) and these results were compared to those obtained with commercial sensitizer N719. The implications of this study may contribute to the design of new molecular architectures to be applied in DSSCs.
Introduction
Solar energy emerges from the sun and it is the cleanest and most abundant renewable energy, which can be harnessed by means of photovoltaic (PV) devices to meet the energy crisis in the near future.1 Due to the significant advances in PV technology, many types of alternative PV devices are being developed, but still inorganic silicon based solar cells are the most efficient solar cells. On the other hand, dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) due to their low cost and easy fabrication techniques, with commercially realistic conversion efficiencies (11.18%),2 are often believed as an alternative to silicon solar cells. Seminal reports on DSSCs have stimulated extensive research interest in improving their efficiencies through the modification of the device components.3 Sensitizers used for harvesting solar radiation play a vital role in determining the conversion efficiency of solar cells. Several types of photo-sensitizers, including metal complexes,4–6 phthalocyanines,7,8 porphyrins9–11 and metal-free organic dyes,12–14 have been investigated for their use in DSSCs in the past few decades. Remarkably, N719 has been considered as a benchmark dye in DSSCs with its record efficiency (11.18%).2 In order to achieve high energy conversion efficiency, primary work has been focused on the preparation of ruthenium sensitizers exhibiting superior light harvesting properties and near infra-red metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) bands. Ancillary ligands, consisting of triphenylamine (TPA),15–17 carbazole,18–22 thiophene23 or ethylenedioxy thiophene (EDOT),24 have been used to prepare ruthenium photo-sensitizers with superior light capturing abilities to match solar radiation. Consequently, a conjugated bridge such as the ethylene group (–CHCH–),21,22 or an electron donor spacer such as thiophene,16,20 between the bipyridyl and the electron donor antenna, enhances the molar extinction coefficient of the resultant photo-sensitizer and, in turn, allows for higher conversion efficiency. For instance, Cao et al.16 designed two photo-sensitizers named KW1 and KW2 without and with the electron donor spacer thiophene between TPA and bipyridyl for DSSC applications. Among them, KW2 exhibited a red-shifted MLCT band centred at 554 nm with a high molar extinction coefficient of 2.43 × 104 M−1 cm−1, due to the high electron delocalization originating from the TPA–thiophene–bipyridyl ligand. The photovoltaic device using the KW2 sensitizer showed high photovoltaic conversion efficiency (10.7%), which is nearly 20% greater than that of the Z907-based reference device under full sunlight irradiation (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). Hence, the spacer influences the photo-physical and electrochemical properties of the ruthenium complexes for efficient light-induced charge separation. Alternatively, NCS free Ru-sensitizers prepared using visible light absorbing dipyrrin chromophores25,26 and strong donor cyclometallating ligands such as phenylpyridine27 and pyrid-2-yltetrazolate28 were demonstrated as potential DSSC components. Another promising approach is to super-sensitize the dye molecule by the addition of a secondary electron-donor group such as triphenylamine in the ancillary ligand.29,30 Such a supramolecular system provides a potentially attractive approach for controlling the charge separation, and recombination dynamics in molecular/nano crystal devices. Haque et al.30 reported a supermolecular dye sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 film which showed a remarkably long lived (4 second) charge separated state. This effect is caused by the increase in the spatial separation between the HOMO of the sensitizer and the TiO2 surface. Therefore, the introduction of secondary electron transfer functions into the sensitizer retards the charge recombination dynamics, while still retaining light induced charge separation at the semiconductor/TiO2 interface. Thus, an innovative and systematic design of ruthenium sensitizers to surpass the photovoltaic performance of commercial N719 dye is needed.
Introduction of spiro-conjugated donor–acceptor ancillary ligands into ruthenium sensitizers is another way to introduce secondary electron donor substituents.31,32 As a continuation of our effort towards the design of improved heteroleptic Ru-based sensitizers,32 here we employ 4,5-diazafluorene with carbazole antenna units to synthesize new types of sensitizers that were named S3 and S4 (Fig. 1), with the aim of further enhancing the conversion efficiencies and of gaining new insights into the opto-electronic properties of these chromophores. Bipolar ligand precursor systems (L1 and L2), containing electron transporting 4,5-diazafluorene units and hole transporting carbazole units, were prepared via a simple one-step procedure (Scheme S1, ESI†). Bromination of L1 and L2 with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in dichloromethane (DCM) selectively produced the corresponding dibromo compounds Br-L1 and Br-L2. Subsequently, Ullmann coupling of carbazole with Br-L1 and Br-L2 in the presence of copper(I) iodide, 18-crown-6 and potassium carbonate in 1,2-dichlorobenzene at reflux temperature resulted in ligands L3 and L4 as white solids with high yields of 82% and 85%, respectively. Finally, the ruthenium complexes S3 and S4 were synthesized via a typical one-pot synthesis (Scheme S1, ESI†). The scope of the present synthetic strategy is to utilize the electron donating ability of the carbazole unit to increase the lifetime of the charge-separated state of the dye in a DSSC, thereby reducing the recombination of the injected electron at the dye/semiconductor interface. In order to gain insights into the electronic structure and properties of these sensitizers, computational calculations using density functional theory (DFT) have been carried out.

All other chemicals used in this work were of analytical grade purchased from Merck and were used without further purification. 4,5-Diazafluoren-9-one, 9,9-bis(9-ethylcarbazol-3-yl)-4,5-diazafluorene (L1) and 9,9-bis(9-phenylcarbazol-3-yl)-4,5-diazafluorene (L2) were synthesized according to a procedure reported previously in the literature.32 Synthetic methods for the synthesis of the other intermediate compounds are presented in the ESI.†
Analytical measurements

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 500 MHz and 100 MHz spectrometer, respectively. The reported chemical shifts were in parts per million (ppm) against tetramethylsilane (TMS). Elemental analyses were performed using a Fison EA 1108 analyzer. UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded in a 1 cm path length quartz cell using a JASCO V-760 spectrometer (Tokyo, Japan). Electrochemical measurements were performed using a CHI604E electrochemical analyser. A conventional three-electrode cell assembly consisting of a glassy carbon (GC) working electrode, a platinum wire auxiliary electrode and a silver wire as a reference electrode was employed. The cyclic voltammograms were recorded at a scan rate of 0.05 V s−1 using the sample solutions containing 3 × 10−4 M of the sensitizer and 0.1 M TBAPF6 in anhydrous N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF) as a supporting electrolyte under an argon atmosphere.
Dye-sensitized solar cell fabrication
The transparent titania electrodes (active area, 0.36 cm2; thickness, 10–12 μm) were impregnated with a 0.05 M titanium tetrachloride solution and sintered at 500 °C and then cooled to 50 °C before being dipped into dye solution. The dye solution was prepared at a concentration of 3 × 10−4 M in ethanol and the electrodes were dipped into the dye solution for 24 h. After the dye adsorption was complete, the electrode was withdrawn from the solution and dried under a stream of argon gas of purity 99.99%. The platinum counter electrode and the dye-coated TiO2 films were then put together. A thin transparent film of the Surlyn polymer frame (25 μm) was sandwiched between these two electrodes. The sandwiched electrodes were tightly held, and heat (130 °C) was applied around the Surlyn frame to seal the two electrodes. A thin layer of electrolyte, consisting of 0.6 M propyl methyl imidazolium iodide (PMII), 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, and 0.5 M tert-butyl pyridine in 3-methoxypropionitrile, was introduced into the inter-electrode spacing from the counter electrode side through predrilled holes. The drilled holes were sealed with a microscope cover slide and Surlyn to avoid leakage of the electrolyte solution.
Photovoltaic measurements
A solar simulator device (Model: CT80AAA, PET Photo Emission Tech., Inc., USA) consisting of a 300 W xenon light source was used to illuminate 1 Sun AM1.5G (100 mW cm−2) over the surface of the test cell. During each measurement, the temperature of the platen which holds the cell was maintained at 25 °C using a control system attached to the solar simulator. The power of the simulated light was calibrated using a reference silicon photodiode (20 mm × 20 mm) provided with the instrument. The test cell was placed at the same position as the calibration cell. Photocurrent–voltage plots for all the cells were recorded using a Keithley 2400 digital source meter, from +950 to −300 mV, in steps of 10 mV. All cells were measured using a mask with an aperture size of 0.64 cm2.
Computational studies
The geometry optimization, electronic structure calculation and localization of the frontier molecular orbitals (MOs) for complexes S3 and S4 were carried out using density functional theory (DFT) calculations in DMF as a solvent. Calculations were performed using the Becke's three parameter hybrid exchange functional and Lee–Yang–Parr correlation functional (B3LYP method)33 in conjunction with the 6-31G(d) basis set for H, C, N, O and S atoms and the LANL2DZ34,35 basis set and pseudopotentials for the Ru metal atom. The optimized geometries were used to obtain the frontier MOs and to carry out time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) studies at the same level of theory. Solvent effects were taken into account using the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM)36,37 as implemented in Gaussian 09 software.38 All electronic structure calculations were accomplished by using Gaussian 09W on a 64-bit processor (64 GB RAM) DELL server and the GaussView 539 interface program was used for visualization and analysis of chemical structures and their electronic properties.
Results and discussion
Optimized structures of sensitizers S3 and S4
The ground state geometries of sensitizers S3 and S4 optimized through DFT calculations are shown in Fig. 2. The ground state optimized geometries suggest that the carbazole donor antenna units and the 4,5-diazafluorene core in sensitizers S3 and S4 are non-planar. With the aim of understanding the non-planarity behaviour in these molecular systems, the dihedral angle between the carbazole moiety attached to the 4,5-diazafluorene unit and the diazafluorene core was measured from the optimized geometries of the sensitizers (Fig. 2). Owing to the tetrahedral character of the sp3 hybridized carbon atom (C21), in sensitizer S3, the dihedral angle (Φ) between the left carbazole moiety and the 4,5-diazafluorene unit is 66.9° (Φ1; C20–C18–C21–C32), and that between the right carbazole and the 4,5-diazafluorene unit is 65.8° (Φ2; C15–C14–C21–C26). Similarly, for sensitizer S4 (sp3 carbon; C21), the dihedral angle values are 66.3° (Φ3; C20–C18–C21–C32) and 66.5° (Φ4; C15–C14–C21–C26) for left and right carbazoles, respectively. This implies that the tetrahedral character of σ-bonds in this C21 atom maintains the relative perpendicular orientation of the electron donor (carbazole)–acceptor (4,5-diazafluorene) units. These twists in the molecular structure could prevent the inter-molecular π–π stacked aggregation of donor units between the sensitizers.

Carbon atoms are shown in magenta, nitrogen atoms in orange, sulfur atoms in yellow, oxygen atoms in red, hydrogen atoms in cyan, and ruthenium atom in light pink. Dihedral angles Φ1 (66.9) and Φ2 (65.8) for sensitizer S3 and Φ3 (66.3) and Φ4 (66.5) for sensitizer S4 are also shown. 
Besides, the steric hindrance of the tail in carbazole moieties as antennae could also prevent unfavorable aggregation of the sensitizers on the TiO2 surface and the charge recombination at the TiO2/electrolyte interface, both of which have an adverse effect on the photocurrent and photovoltage and, therefore, contributes to an increase in the efficiency of DSSCs.
Optical properties
The electronic absorption spectra of sensitizers S3, S4 and N719 measured in DMF are given in Fig. 3 and the peak wavelength and molar extinction coefficients are compiled in Table 1. The absorption peaks at 263 and 268 nm of sensitizers S3 and S4, respectively, are assigned to the carbazole-centered n–π* transition.40 The peak at 291 nm for both sensitizers S3 and S4 is mainly attributed to the π–π* transitions centred at the 4,5-diazafluorene core,41 whereas for N719 the bands at 303 and 310 nm are due to π–π* transitions arising from the 4,4′-dicarboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine (dcbpy) ligand. From a careful comparison with the homoleptic complex N719, other absorption bands in the UV region at 341 and 342 nm, with high molar extinction coefficients, were observed for sensitizers S3 and S4, respectively. This longer wavelength absorption band can be assigned to the photo-induced electron transfer (PET) that originates from the electron-donating carbazole moiety to the electron-accepting 4,5-diazafluorene moiety.42,43 This additional band merges with the broad band in the region between 380 and 385 nm, arising from a mixture of ligand-to-ligand charge transfers (LLCTs) and high energy metal-to-ligand charge transfers (MLCTs), as observed in the case of N719. The absorption maxima of the low energy MLCT bands of S3 (516 nm; 0.64 × 104 M−1 cm−1) and S4 (518 nm; 1.03 × 104 M−1 cm−1) are blue shifted and exhibit low molar extinction coefficients in comparison with the standard N719 sensitizer (1.47 × 104 M−1 cm−1). This could be associated with the large dihedral angle between carbazole and 4,5-diazafluorene units (see Fig. 2) in the ancillary ligand that limits both the π conjugation and the intra-molecular interaction between them. This also suggests that the carbazole moiety substitution on the ancillary ligand has no influence on the molar extinction coefficient of the low energy MLCT absorption band. Therefore, the non-planar geometry of the ancillary ligand causes the MLCT band of the sensitizers to remain at higher energy levels.

Electrochemical properties
The cyclic voltammograms for sensitizers S3 and S4 in DMF are shown in Fig. 4. Sensitizers S3 and S4 show a quasi-reversible wave for the RuII/RuIII redox couple. Using the onset oxidation potential values, the HOMO energy values were calculated using the equation  (Table 2), with ferrocene (0.42 V Ag/AgCl) as a standard. The HOMO level values for sensitizers S3 and S4 were found to be −5.03 and −5.08 eV, respectively, which are notably lower when compared to that of the I3−/I− couple (−4.60 eV vs. vacuum).44 This indicates that dye regeneration is thermodynamically favourable and avoids the recombination between photo-injected electrons on the TiO2 film and oxidized dye molecules. Furthermore, the LUMO values for the sensitizers were calculated from ELUMO = EHOMO − E0–0, where E0–0 is the absorption onset estimated from the electronic absorption spectra of the sensitizers. The LUMO values for sensitizers S3 and S4 were found to be −3.24 and −3.28 eV, respectively, which are higher than the experimental conduction band of TiO2 (−4.00 eV).44 Thus, these LUMO values indicate the thermodynamic driving force for electron injection from the excited dye into the TiO2 conduction band.

DFT and TD-DFT calculations
To gain more insights into the relationships between the structural, electronic and optical properties of the studied molecular systems, DFT and TD-DFT calculations were performed on sensitizers S3 and S4. The electron density distributions of the frontier molecular orbitals HOMO, HOMO−1, HOMO−2, LUMO, LUMO+1 and LUMO+2 for complexes S3 and S4 are depicted in Fig. 5. The calculated ground state values for the HOMO energy levels of the optimized sensitizers S3 and S4 were −5.35 eV and −5.38 eV, respectively, which agree well with the electrochemically determined HOMO energy levels (see Table 2). It is observed from Fig. 5 that the electron densities of the next lower energy highest occupied molecular orbitals of S3, HOMO−2 and HOMO−3 (Fig. S1, ESI†), and of S4, HOMO−1 and HOMO−3 (Fig. S1, ESI†), are dominantly populated at the ruthenium atom and the two axial isothiocyanate (NCS) ligands. Markedly, the HOMO and HOMO−1 of S3 and HOMO and HOMO−2 of S4 are localized on the carbazole moiety of ligands L3 and L4, respectively. Although π-clouds localized on the carbazole units are observed on HOMOs, the π-orbitals are not delocalized over the 4,5-diazafluorene unit due to the large dihedral angle between both units. This also clarifies that the electron-transporting diazafluorene unit and hole-transporting carbazole unit ensembles a bipolar charge transporting molecule. Thus, the poor π-bonding orbital overlap between the ruthenium atom, NCS ligands and electron donor units may be responsible for the blue shift and low molar extinction coefficients of the low energy MLCT absorption bands in the sensitizers. It is also worth noting that the highest occupied molecular orbitals HOMO, HOMO−1 and HOMO−2 (Fig. 5) are very close in energy in both sensitizers, with energy differences among them of less than 0.04 eV. This explains the different order seen for the MOs in sensitizers S3 and S4. On the other hand, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals LUMO, LUMO+2 and LUMO+3 (Fig. S1, ESI†) of sensitizers S3 and S4 have amplitudes mostly on the anchoring bipyridyl ligands, while the LUMO+1 in S3 and S4 are localized on the electron-deficient 4,5-diazafluorene ligands, L3 and L4, respectively. From TD-DFT calculations, the lowest singlet–singlet vertical excitation energies (E0–0) for sensitizers S3 and S4 gave values of about 1.87 eV (Table 2), which agree relatively well with the experimental values obtained from optical analysis. It is also possible to see that the ethyl and phenyl groups, which are linked to the nitrogen atom of the carbazole units, did not contribute to the energetics of the entire molecule, although there are small differences in their absorption intensities. On the other hand, using the relation, ESOPsinglet = EHOMO − E0–0, the excited state oxidation potentials (ESOPs) for sensitizers S3 and S4 gave values of about −3.48 and −3.51 eV, respectively. These values are positively shifted relative to the conduction band edge of TiO2 (−4.04 eV),45 which indicates that electron injection from both sensitizers is thermodynamically favourable.

Photovoltaic properties
The photocurrent density (J)–voltage (V) characteristics of photovoltaic devices fabricated using sensitizers S3, S4 and N719, under illumination of 100 mW cm−2, are shown in Fig. 6. The photovoltaic parameters such as the short circuit photo-current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (η), as estimated from these curves, are compiled in Table 3. Sensitizers S3 and S4 exhibit power conversion efficiencies (η) of 1.88% and 2.11%, respectively, whereas N719 exhibits a η value of 4.37% under similar conditions.

It appears that the specific molecular structures of S3 and S4, in particular, the presence of carbazole groups at larger dihedral angles, reduce the recombination rate, most likely by inhibiting the access by iodine/iodide electrolyte to the TiO2 surface. Also, the bi-polar ancillary ligand (electron donating carbazole group and electron accepting 4,5-diazafluorene unit) undergoes efficient photo-induced electron transfer upon light absorption (S3, 341 nm; S4, 342 nm, as shown in Table 1) and acts as a source of electrons in the excited state, reasonably stabilizing the hole produced after electron injection, thereby slowing down the charge recombination (Scheme 1). Despite this setback, both Voc and Jsc were significantly improved relative to sensitizers S1 (Voc = 0.49 V, Jsc = 1.09 mA cm−2, η = 0.36%) and S2 (Voc = 0.50 V, Jsc = 1.23 mA cm−2, η = 0.42%) documented in an earlier report.32 Moreover, from DFT studies, it is realized that the HOMO for both sensitizers S3 and S4 is shifted to the secondary electron donor carbazole moiety, potentially displacing away, from the NCS ligands and closer to the carbazole moiety, the positive charge (hole) in the oxidised form of the sensitizer. Hence, the HOMO located over the electron rich carbazole might offer indirect evidence that the carbazole moiety maintains the “hole” produced away from the TiO2 surface after electron injection from the dye-excited state into the TiO2. This results in an increased spatial separation of the cation center of the sensitizer away from the semiconductor TiO2 electrode surface. As a consequence, the secondary electron donor carbazole antenna in sensitizer S4 slows down the interfacial charge recombination dynamics at the dye/semiconductor interface, as depicted in Scheme 1, and a long-lived charge separated pair could be formed at the interface region.29,30 It is obvious that similar effects may also occur in sensitizer S3. Hence, utilization of bipolar ancillary ligands can balance the charge carriers and broaden the recombination zone in the dye/semiconductor interface, thereby reducing the recombination process. This phenomenon plays a key factor in the operation of sensitizers S3 and S4 for the achieved photon-to-current conversion efficiencies. It is important to notice that the HOMO, HOMO−1 and HOMO−2 represent degenerate states in both sensitizers and therefore a more complex mechanism may also take place in the DSSC, where the electron holes may also be formed on the NCS ligands. In spite of this, it is expected that carbazole groups have the greatest contribution to the formation of long-lived charge separated states. Further computational studies where these dyes are linked to the TiO2 surface may shed more light on this point.

Although the efficiencies of sensitizers S3 and S4 are marginally higher than S1 and S2,32 they are still low when compared to the standard N719. As explained above, this might be attributed to the long-lived charge separated states which diminish the regeneration of the neutral dye by iodide, as regeneration of well separated charge species by iodide does not occur faster than recombination of the electron–hole pairs produced.46 Therefore, these sensitizers suffered from poor regeneration of the oxidized dyes formed upon light absorption. Furthermore, it has been seen that triplet intra-ligand (IL) excited states coming from the ambi-polar ligands formed between carbazole and 4,5-diazafluorene43 lead to longer lifetimes, resulting in low radiative rates for the sensitizer,47 and thus slowing dye regeneration. In line with this, ruthenium complexes appended with triphenylamine and pyrene are dominant with intra-ligand excited states and so show low DSSC efficiencies.48 Hence, the poor conversion efficiency in sensitizers S3 and S4 may be attributed to the well separated charged species at the dye/TiO2 interface and IL excited states. The simple methodology proposed here for the supermolecular design of dyes is a versatile approach to control the interfacial charge transfer in molecular electronic devices.
Conclusions
We have successfully synthesized and characterized two novel sensitizers, S3 and S4, and demonstrated their optical, electrochemical and photo-voltaic properties. A carbazole antenna was introduced to function as a secondary electron donor system in the sensitizer, with the aim of enhancing the solar cell conversion efficiency. The non-planarity and a wide range of dihedral angles between the donor and acceptor units reduced the electronic communication and orbital overlap between them. It remains clear that a perpendicular arrangement of the secondary electron donor antenna units to the coordinating diazafluorene unit is crucial for the observed absorption spectra of the sensitizer. Whilst this low absorption is not ideal for use in a DSSC, the bipolar nature of the ligand in the sensitizer helps in slowing down the charge recombination at the dye/semiconductor interface. This phenomenon provides an ideal opportunity to study chromophores such as anthracene, pentacene, fluorene and pyrene, linked to diazafluorene units, which might help in stabilizing the hole produced and also play a role in improving the light-harvesting ability of the sensitizer. Thus the combination strategy of inorganic chromophores and organic chromophores offers an alternative way for the construction of more efficient sensitizers in which multiple electron donors and chromophores can be organised in an orderly fashion to facilitate panchromatic absorption for increased device efficiency. We believe that this highlight provides a complete overview of the state of the art in this particular field and will provide guidance for strategies to design efficient donor–acceptor metal complex systems towards much improved DSSCs.
