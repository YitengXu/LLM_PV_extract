    , Accepted 18th October 2022First published on 20th October 2022AbstractWe synthesized POBA dye and studied its performance as a sensitizer and co-sensitizer. In addition, we present a simple method for producing Ni-doped TiO2 with various molar concentrations for use as a photoanode in a DSSC. Further, poly(vinylidene fluoride)/polyethylene glycol (PVDF-PEG) gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) having different concentrations of 1-n-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide were prepared and optimized for usage in DSSCs. We initially tested the performance of POBA dye on TiO2 and Ni-doped TiO2 photoanode materials. Among the POBA sensitized devices, 4% Ni–TiO2 showed a high efficiency of 1.85%. Then, we sensitized Z907 dye on the 4% Ni–TiO2 photoanode, followed by sensitizing it with POBA, which compensated the absorption defect of the Z907 dye as well as filling the gap between the standard dye molecules. This approach enhances and broadens the absorption spectrum of the dyes by molecular filling, compensates for the lack of absorption of Z907, and reduces the recombination of charges. The Z907-based DSSC showed 4.52% efficiency, and after co-sensitization, the DSSC showed an increase in efficiency (5.77%). These findings show that co-sensitizers can cover the naked spectrum in the ultraviolet-visible region, fill the empty space on Ni–TiO2, and reduce recombination reactions. The main motive of this research is to enhance the photo-ability of sensitizers and metal-free co-sensitizers in a Ni–TiO2 photoanode and blend gel polymer electrolyte-based DSSCs.
1. Introduction
One of the promising technologies used to solve environmental and energy issues is solar energy, which has received increasing attention from researchers over the last decade and will continue to do so in the research area of renewable energy. In this context, dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted most of the attention of researchers owing to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and low cost.1–4 In DSSCs, there are five main components, a conductive mechanical support, a semiconductor layer, a sensitizer, a redox couple, and a counter electrode.5–7 Even though all the components play a crucial role in the overall performance of the DSSC, the photosensitizer plays a more vital role in improving its efficiency.8,9 Ruthenium (Ru) complexes have been extensively studied recently and efficiency over 11% has been observed for small cells.10–12 Due to the scarcity and high cost of noble Ru metal, metal-free organic dyes were quickly developed, offering benefits such as simple molecular design, easy synthesis, fine-tuning of optical and electrochemical characteristics, a high molar extinction coefficient, and low cost.13–18 Among various metal-free sensitizers, the phenothiazine (PTZ)-based dyes have piqued curiosity, and they have been used as a donor unit in the sensitizer structure, which has resulted in good photovoltaic performance because of their non-planarity and butterfly-like shape in the ground state, which reduces aggregation.19–28 More importantly, PTZ is a six member heterocyclic molecule that has a nitrogen and a sulphur atom, which act as powerful donors compared to other donor moieties such as triphenylamine and carbazole.19,29–36 Furthermore, the carboxylic acid group (COOH) is the most common acceptor/anchor unit used in dye structures since the COOH unit extracts electrons efficiently from the excited sensitizer into the metal oxide semiconductor's conduction band, while increased loading of dye molecules on a metal oxide semiconductor ultimately improves the performance of DSSCs. However, the proton of the carboxylic acid functionality adsorbs on the surface of the metal oxide semiconductor and induces a positive shift in the semiconductor's conduction band, which results in open circuit photovoltage (VOC) loss. The adsorption mode is widely recognized to have a substantial impact on DSSC photovoltaic characteristics such as VOC and short circuit current density (JSC).37 Therefore, with wide absorption and high molar absorptivity, an ideal photosensitizer should gather as much sunlight as possible. But, designing a sensitizer with photon absorbing capacity over the whole spectrum of sunlight is extremely difficult. Thus, various studies have concentrated on the development of co-sensitized devices. Co-sensitization is a method where two or more distinct dyes are made to adsorb on a metal oxide semiconductor electrode to improve the DSSC's light-harvesting capacities by extending the light absorption range.38 Luo et al.39,40 recently used a similar technique to make high-efficiency DSSCs by co-sensitizing PTZ-based dyes with the standard N719 dye. These dyes exhibited high molar extinction coefficients and strong absorption, which compensates for N719's poor absorption in the low wavelength region, notably between 300 and 500 nm. As a result, compared to sensitization with N719 alone (6.97%), co-sensitization of the PTZ-based dyes with the standard N719 yielded efficiencies of 8.01–8.42%. Hence, in the present study, we combined a PTZ-based organic dye with Ru(II) complex dyes (Z907) to fabricate a device with increased light harvesting ability.
In DSSCs, the working electrode is usually obtained by coating a semiconductor such as TiO2, SnO2 or ZnO on a transparent conducting substrate. Among the different semiconductors, TiO2 is the most widely utilized semiconductor due to its photocatalytic characteristics and high efficiency.41 However, low electron transport, significant charge recombination, and a wide band gap limit the utilization of TiO2 as a semiconductor.42 In order to overcome these issues, researcher have attempted to dope TiO2 with other elements such as metals that enhanced the trapping-to-recombination rate ratio of TiO2.43 In the doping process, small amounts of impurities were introduced into the semiconductor, to modify the parent material's morphological, structural, electrical, and optical characteristics.44 Doping can also narrow or enlarge a semiconductor's band gap, resulting in impurity energy levels and oxygen vacancies.45,46 In order to further improve the photoresponse, the addition of a layer of large particles over a nanocrystalline layer of TiO2 can improve the efficiency by strengthening the light scattering effects of the most intense red light in the solar spectrum. Moreover, large microstructures, with size comparable to the incident light's wavelength, are typically chosen in DSSCs because they enhance light scattering.47 A layer of large particles is fabricated for light scattering over the bottom layer in the double layer photoanode film, which contains nano sized TiO2 particles. Because of its extended wavelength absorption and improved electron transport characteristics, this bilayer nanostructure photoanode can gather a lot of light.48 Thus, we proposed nickel (Ni)-doped TiO2 having a mixture of sheet and spherical morphology fabricated as a scattering layer above the nanocrystallite layer as a viable photoanode for DSSCs in the present work.
In DSSC fabrication, liquid electrolytes are commonly utilized since they have a high conversion efficiency. But, they have disadvantages such as being prone to leaking, evaporation, corroding the counter electrode, and they can induce dye photodegradation, thus making the DSSC unstable. Polymer electrolytes have been developed as possible liquid electrolyte replacements to address these flaws.49–59 Polymer electrolytes are made out of polymer matrixes into which a variety of salts have been incorporated. The majority of polymer-salt binary systems do not have adequate conductivity for applications.60–62 As a result, many techniques have been implemented to enhance the conductivity of polymer electrolytes utilizing plasticizers,63,64 inorganic fillers,56,65,66 and ionic liquids.67–69 The use of ionic liquids as a conductivity booster is our strategy. Organic cations and inorganic anions make up ionic liquids.70,71 Ionic liquids provide a number of benefits over the rest of the organic plasticizing solvents, including non-volatility, non-flammability, chemical stability, and thermal stability.72–74 Ionic liquid doped polymer electrolytes are ideal candidates for use in DSSCs because of these characteristics. Mohammadi's research group75 developed a DSSC employing a gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) based on hydroxypropyl cellulose/1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide and achieved an efficiency of 7.44%. Whereas, Narasimha et al.76 produced poly(ethylene oxide)/poly(ethylene glycol) dimethyl ether based GPEs with added acetamide and NaI/I2, and achieved an efficiency of 5.92%. For DSSC application, Manafi et al.77 used a poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoro propylene) and poly(ethylene oxide) blend with a 1-butyl-3-methylimidozium iodide-based electrolyte and achieved a 5.78% efficiency.
Inspired by the findings stated above, we synthesised nickel (Ni)-doped titanium dioxide (TiO2) particles with various molar concentrations of nickel precursor in the current study. For better suitability as a photoanode in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), the influence of Ni doping on the compositional, morphological, structural, and electrical characteristics of TiO2 was extensively investigated. Further, the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs was improved by employing auxiliary molecules as co-sensitizers in addition to the standard dyes. To obtain an effective DSSC, a metal-free phenothiazine-based co-sensitizer (POBA) was used in combination with a ruthenium complex dye (Z907) and 1-n-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide doped poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)/polyethyleneglycol (PEG) gel polymer electrolytes. From the results, it can be seen that the 4% Ni–TiO2-based DSSC displayed better performance compared to the other devices. Thus, this anode material was utilized to fabricate a co-sensitized device. Interestingly, the highest efficiency was achieved for a co-sensitized device (5.77%). Similarly, the efficiency of the Z907-based device was found to be 4.52%.

All the chemicals used in this study were procured from Merck, India and utilized without additional purification. A Shimadzu-8400S spectrometer was used to record FTIR spectra using the KBr pellet method in the range of 400–4000 cm−1. With TMS as an internal reference, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded using Bruker (400 MHz and 100 MHz, respectively) spectrometers. A Bruker Miniflex 600 model was used to record the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. A BioLogic SP-150 was used for all electrochemical measurements. A Keithley 2450 source meter was used to characterize the I–V of the produced DSSCs.
2.2. Synthesis of 4-(3-(10-ethyl-10H-phenothiazin-2-yl)-3-oxoprop-1-en-1-yl)benzoic acid (POBA)

Step 1: Synthesis of 1-(10-ethyl-10H-phenothiazin-2-yl)ethan-1-one. 
1-(10H-Phenothiazin-2-yl)ethan-1-one was firstly dissolved in DMF, then supplemented with an appropriate amount of K2CO3 and stirred for some time. To this mixture, bromoethane was added dropwise and refluxed (12 hours). The obtained solution was added to water slowly and the obtained precipitate of 1-(10-ethyl-10H-phenothiazin-2-yl)ethan-1-one was filtered.


Step 2: Synthesis of POBA. 
The product obtained in step 1, 1-(10-ethyl-10H-phenothiazin-2-yl)ethan-1-one, and 4-formylbenzoic acid (1:1) were dissolved in an appropriate amount of ethanol and 10% NaOH solution was added. The prepared reaction mixture was kept stirring at room temperature for about 15 hours. Completion of the reaction was checked using TLC. After that, the reaction mixture was added to water and neutralized with HCl. The obtained precipitate was filtered using a Buckner funnel and washed thoroughly with water. The obtained precipitate was further purified using column chromatography using a hexane and ethyl acetate mixture to get pure POBA (Scheme 1). Yield: 80%. FTIR (cm−1): 3178.5 (OH), 2915.4 (CH),1680.2 (–CO), 1585.2 (CC); 1H NMR (DMSO) δ (ppm): 8.82 (s, 1H), 8.01 (s, 3H), 7.91 (d, J = 15.7 Hz, 1H), 7.75 (d, J = 15.5 Hz, 1H), 7.65 (d, J = 8.2 Hz, 1H), 7.31 (s, 1H), 7.10 (d, J = 7.8 Hz, 1H), 7.01 (t, J = 7.7 Hz, 1H), 6.93 (d, J = 7.5 Hz, 1H), 6.78 (t, J = 7.6 Hz, 1H), 6.67 (d, J = 8.1 Hz, 1H), 4.34 (q, J = 6.9 Hz, 2H), 1.34 (t, J = 6.8 Hz, 3H); 13C NMR (DMSO) δ (ppm): 188.42, 165.75, 142.65, 142.61, 141.53, 139.61, 137.09, 131.54, 130.02, 129.41, 128.52, 126.76, 126.66, 124.76, 124.46, 123.22, 122.63, 115.61, 115.09, 113.33, 61.45, 14.62; ESI-MS (m/z): [M + H]+: 402.2.

2.3. Synthesis of pristine and Ni-doped TiO2 (Ni–TiO2)
To prepare TiO2 particles, 4 mL of acetic acid was mixed with 20 mL of ethanol in a beaker and stirred for some time at room temperature. To this, 7.4 mL of titanium isopropoxide (TTIP) was added dropwise under stirring. After homogenization of the mixture, it was added dropwise to 40 mL of paraffin oil at 120 °C and stirred for 10 min. The obtained precipitate was filtered (obtained filtrate of oil was reused for Ni-doped TiO2 synthesis) and calcined at 450 °C for 3 h. In order to prepare Ni–TiO2 particles, the appropriate amount of nickel nitrate (2, 4 and 6 mol%) was added to the mixture after the addition of TTIP and followed by the same procedure as described above.
2.4. Preparation of PVDF and PEG based GPEs
Appropriate amounts of PVDF and PEG were added to DMF and stirred until the formation of a homogenous solution. After that, potassium iodide (KI), 1-n-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (ionic liquid) and I2 were added slowly to the mixture under stirring. Then, this prepared mixture was poured onto a Petri plate and kept in a vacuum oven at 70 °C for 24 hours to form a gel type film. The following table shows the composition of the prepared gel polymer electrolytes with varied amounts of ionic liquid Table 1.

2.5. Fabrication of devices
Photoanodes made of TiO2 and Ni–TiO2 as well as the platinum-based counter electrodes were fabricated using the procedures described in a previous report.17,78 Further, the fabricated TiO2, 2% Ni–TiO2, 4% Ni–TiO2, and 6% Ni–TiO2 photoanodes were soaked in pure POBA dye solutions (0.5 mM in ethanol) for 24 hours, and the two 4% Ni–TiO2 based photoanodes were soaked in pure Z907 solutions (0.5 mM in ethanol). To achieve the co-sensitization effect, one photoanode sensitized with pure Z907 dye was separately soaked in a POBA solution for the next 24 hours. After that, a PVDF-PEG based electrolyte was placed between the prepared photoanode and counter electrode.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Optical and electrochemical properties of POBA dye

Fig. 1(a) shows the absorption spectrum of the synthesised dye in THF solution, and the relevant statistics are listed in Table 2. The absorption band of POBA dye is located at about 450.26 nm. This band is associated with an intramolecular donor → acceptor charge transfer (ICT) transition from PTZ to the acceptor moiety.79–81 The absorption spectra recorded when POBA is anchored on the bare TiO2, 2% Ni–TiO2, 4% Ni–TiO2, and 6% Ni–TiO2 surfaces are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The solid film absorption spectra were broadened in comparison to the absorption spectra of the dye solutions, demonstrating that the majority of the dye molecules adsorbed onto the semiconductor surface. The interaction between the carboxylate group of POBA and the Ti4+ ions of the semiconductor is responsible for the broadening of the spectra. This lowers the dye's π* energy level, which is good for DSSC behaviour, particularly the photocurrent.82–84 The pristine and doped TiO2 surfaces were dyed in the following order: 4% Ni–TiO2 > 6% Ni–TiO2 > 2% Ni–TiO2 > bare TiO2. Fig. 1(b) shows the typical cyclic voltammogram response of the synthesised POBA. The POBA dye's oxidation potential or highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is around 0.93 V versus NHE, which is higher than the typical potential of the iodine/iodide redox pair (0.4 V vs. NHE), ensuring a stronger driving force for dye regeneration via the electrolyte.85 The dye's reduction potential or lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) values were calculated using the formula ELUMO = EHOMO − E0–0, where the optical band-gap energy (E0–0) was estimated from the absorption onset. The LUMO of POBA dye was calculated to be around −1.28 V vs. NHE, which is more negative than TiO2's conduction band edge (−0.5 V vs. NHE), implying that the dye's excited electrons can be efficiently injected into the TiO2 conduction band.86,87 As a result of the electrochemical experiments, the produced POBA dye may thermodynamically operate as a sensitizer for TiO2 in a triiodide redox electrolyte.

3.2. Theoretical calculations of the POBA dye
Density functional theory calculations were done by using the Schrodinger material suite software with the B3LYP-D3 functional and 6-31G** basis set to better understand the structural and electron distributions of the POBA dye. Fig. 2 depicts the frontier molecular orbitals (HOMO and LUMO) of POBA dye. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the POBA dye molecule are −5.1 and −2.49 eV, respectively, with an energy band gap of 2.6 eV, which is close to the band gap of 2.21 eV obtained by optical measurements. The LUMO for the POBA dye is located above the TiO2 conduction band edge (−4 eV vs. vacuum), allowing for the transport of electrons to the conduction band of TiO2 from the LUMO of POBA. Conversely, the HOMOs are situated below the iodine/iodide redox potential (−4.60 eV vs. vacuum), permitting its regeneration.88–90 Further, charge separation in the POBA dye can be described by the distribution of electron density on the HOMO and LUMO, which helps in understanding electron transport in the dye. The electron density of the HOMO is largely dispersed over the PTZ moiety, whereas the electron density of the LUMO is mostly spread over the carboxyphenyl acceptor moiety. This electron density distribution pattern of the HOMO and LUMO in POBA dye revealed that electron transfer occurs in the excited state from the donor unit to the acceptor core, resulting in the creation of an efficient charge separation system. This charge separation also makes it easier for dyes to expel electrons into the TiO2 conduction band, indicating that POBA dye is suitable for DSSC applications.

3.3. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of TiO2 and Ni–TiO2
The XRD patterns of TiO2 particles with various Ni doping levels are shown in Fig. 3. The XRD peaks at 25.3° (101) and 27.5° (110) correspond to the anatase and rutile crystal phases, respectively.91,92 From the graph, it is clear that the intensity of anatase peaks grew as the level of Ni doping increased. By using the Debye Scherrer equation, the crystallite size of the pure TiO2, and 2%, 4%, and 6% Ni-doped TiO2 particles was calculated to be 18, 14, 15, and 16 nm, respectively. The crystallite size was reduced until it reached an optimal point, and then grew as Ni doping quantity increased. According to the findings, the Ni doping reduced the expansion of crystallite size and hindered the change of TiO2 from anatase to rutile since no Ni phase could be found. The inclusion of Ni into the TiO2 lattice might account for this.93,94

3.4. Morphology and structures of TiO2 and 4% Ni–TiO2
The 4% Ni–TiO2-based DSSC showed the highest efficiency compared to the other photoanode materials. Hence, for further characterization, 4% Ni–TiO2 was used. The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of TiO2 and 4% Ni–TiO2 are depicted in Fig. 4(a and b), respectively. From the figure, it can be seen that TiO2 and 4% Ni–TiO2 have a mixture of sheet- and spherical-like morphology. Further, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of TiO2 and 4% Ni–TiO2 are depicted in Fig. 5(a, b and d, e), respectively. Bare TiO2 displayed interplanar spacings of about d = 0.35 nm and d = 0.32 nm, which are attributed to the (101) plane of anatase TiO2 and (110) plane of rutile TiO2, respectively.95–97 On the other hand, interplanar spacings of about d = 0.35 nm and d = 0.20 nm were exhibited by 4% Ni–TiO2 particles, which are attributed to the (101) plane of anatase TiO2 and (200) plane of NiO.98,99 This observation confirms the effective doping of Ni into the TiO2. In addition, the test results also show that Ni doping helps to suppress the transformation of TiO2 from anatase to rutile (the same result as that of XRD). The existence of the anatase TiO2 (101) plane was also confirmed by the related selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns depicted in Fig. 5(c and f), respectively. Fig. 6(a–d) display the elemental maps that were acquired for the 4% Ni–TiO2 sample. The findings showed the presence of Ti, O, and Ni in relatively consistent amounts, suggesting that Ni was evenly doped in the TiO2 and did not form segregated nickel oxide particles. Furthermore, Ti, O, and Ni were found in the 4% Ni-doped TiO2's EDAX spectrum, which is shown in Fig. 6(e). These findings demonstrated that Ni had been successfully incorporated into TiO2.

3.5. Electrochemical performance of TiO2 and 4% Ni–TiO2
Using CV, the electrochemical behaviour of TiO2 and Ni–TiO2 was investigated (Fig. 7(a)). CV analysis was performed in an aqueous 0.5 M potassium hydroxide solution containing platinum as the CE, with TiO2 and 4% Ni–TiO2 thin films utilized as the working electrodes, and Ag/AgCl as the reference. Compared to the bare TiO2, the Ni-doped TiO2 electrode showed a high double layer charge and reasonable hydrogen evolution current in the cathodic scan direction, which may be attributed to its strong photocatalytic activity.100–103
 Fig. 7  (a) CV plots, (b) EIS plots, and (c) Tafel plots of TiO2 and 4% Ni–TiO2. 
To compare the conductivity and charge transfer kinetic properties of the bare TiO2 and 4% Ni–TiO2 particles, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was performed using symmetric cells. The symmetric cells were fabricated with an electrolyte separated by two identical electrodes. The EIS plots of TiO2 and 4% Ni–TiO2 particles are displayed in Fig. 7(b). From the graph, it can be noted that the grain boundary resistance of TiO2 was higher than that of 4% Ni–TiO2, which confirms the increase in conducting nature of 4% Ni–TiO2. Moreover, doping of the TiO2 matrix with Ni ions increases the mobility and enhances the charge carrier ability thus confirming the rapid interfacial electron transfer and the lowest rate of recombination within composite samples.104,105
Variation in curve nature was observed in the Tafel plot for the 4% Ni-doped TiO2 and bare TiO2 (Fig. 7(c)), and this can be attributed to different mechanisms of charge-transfer at the photo-anode interface. Moreover, with a negative bias supplied to a semiconductor electrode, initially the charge will fill the vacant surface states (below the conduction band edge), followed by concentrating in the space charge layer.106 In addition, the polarisation curve for 4% Ni–TiO2 revealed a negative shift compared to TiO2, implying that the flat band potential (Efb) of TiO2 after Ni-doping shifted negatively. VOC can be measured using the electrode Efb and electrolyte redox potential, and a change in Efb reflects variation of a device's VOC. A negative shift of Efb indicates a shift away from the redox potential and therefore a rise in the value of VOC.107,108 However, it has been previously discovered that doping of TiO2 with transition-metal ions can shift the conduction band edge downward and alter the driving force of the sensitizer's electron injection, leading to an improvement in JSC.109,110
3.6. Ionic conductivity analysis of GPEs
The ionic conductivity of the PVDF-PEG GPEs was investigated using impedance spectroscopy. The impedance plots of the PVDF-PEG electrolytes are shown in Fig. 8(a), and the ionic conductivity graph is presented in Fig. 8(b). Fig. 8(b) shows that when the amount of ionic liquid added increased from 0% to 15%, the ionic conductivity increased. When compared to the pure PVDF-PEG electrolyte, the PVDF-PEG electrolyte containing 15 wt% ionic liquid had the maximum conductivity of 3.41 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature. Conversely, the conductivity fell above the optimal threshold when ionic liquid was added. This finding is linked to the creation of ion pairs, which reduces the concentration of free ions in mixtures.111 At room temperature, ionic liquids have a plasticizing effect. As a result, they soften the polymer's backbone, and also increase polymer segmental mobility and ionic transport by creating additional conducting routes for charge carriers. This enhances the amorphousness of the polymer electrolytes, which improves ionic conductivity even further.112Fig. 8(c) shows the ionic conductivity measurements of an ionic liquid-15% gel electrolyte sample at 303 to 343 K. Ionic conductivity measurements revealed that the conductivity of the sample was enhanced with increased temperature and this observation is due to an increase in the kinetic energy of ions as the temperature rises, which further allows the ions to travel faster.

3.7. Dielectric behavior of polymer electrolytes
For the doped PVDF-PEG gel electrolyte samples (0–20% IL), we investigated the fluctuation of log dielectric constant (logε′) and log dielectric loss (logε′′) versus log frequency (Fig. S6(a and b), ESI,† respectively). At lower frequencies, higher values of logε′ and logε′′ were observed due to ion polarisation, whereas at higher frequencies, logε′ and logε′′ decreased because there was no excess of ion diffusion in the field direction, resulting in a rapid periodic reversal of the electric field. The logε′ and logε′′ values rose from ionic liquid-0% to ionic liquid-15% when additional ionic liquid was added to the gel polymer electrolyte. The charge carrier density dominated the increasing values of logε′ and logε′′. The number of free ions increased as the value of charge carrier density grew, facilitating the rise in ionic conductivity.113–116 The temperature-dependent dielectric behaviour of the ionic liquid-15% sample is shown in Fig. S6(c and d) (ESI†). At low frequencies, the ionic liquid-15% polymer electrolyte has a high dielectric constant and dielectric loss, which steadily decreases with increasing frequency and approaches zero at higher frequencies. This pattern suggests the presence of the electrode polarisation effect. Due to the increasing flexibility and segmental motion of the polymer chain, the dielectric behaviour of the composite polymer electrolytes improves as the temperature rises (303–373 K).117,118
Fig. S7 (ESI†) shows the real (M′) and imaginary (M′′) components of the electric modulus against log frequency for various ionic liquid doped PVDF-PEG gel polymer electrolyte samples. The M′ and M′′ values rose at a higher frequency, as shown in Fig. S7(a and b) (ESI†). The PVDF-PEG gel polymer electrolyte samples can be identified as ionic conductors based on this. This was due to the presence of charge carriers, which can aid in increasing ionic conductivity. Both M′ and M′′ revealed zero values with a decreased frequency. Capacitance has been shown to be connected to the electrodes via the tail. Because there was capacitance associated with the electrolyte, the effect of polarization was extremely small.113–116 The M′ and M′′ behaviour of ionic liquid-15% as a function of temperature is depicted in Fig. S7(c and d) (ESI†). M′ is dispersed at higher frequencies and is near zero at low frequencies, as shown. From the figure, it may be deduced that at higher temperatures, ionic liquid-15% has a shorter relaxation period and, by free ion hopping, the sample is thermally activated.119
3.8. Photoelectrochemical properties
The TiO2 film thickness has a significant impact on PCE because it can enhance dye loading and photocurrent density. Thus, we fabricated DSSCs with different TiO2 film thicknesses sensitized with POBA dye. The photovoltaic characteristics of the DSSCs with different TiO2 film thicknesses are displayed in Table S1 (ESI†). It can be seen that JSC increases from 3.04 to 3.57 mA cm−2 when the thickness of TiO2 film increases from ∼5.5 to ∼15.3 μm and it decreases to 3.45 mA cm−2 when the thickness of the film is about ∼20.8 μm. The DSSC efficiency largely follows the same pattern with respect to TiO2 film thickness, showing a maximum efficiency value of 1.21% for a TiO2 film thickness of ∼15.3 μm. Based on these findings, it appears that the maximum electron injection rate from the excited dye into the conduction band of TiO2 and the maximum rate of photon absorption by the dye both clearly occur at ∼15.3 μm thickness. Also, by increasing the film thickness, more trapping surface states are likely to be created, which would enhance the back electron transfer and reduce VOC. Further, we also optimized POBA concentration for sensitization. From the results, it was observed that the 0.5 mM POBA sensitized device showed the highest efficiency compared to the other concentrations (Table S2, ESI†). The photovoltaic characteristics of DSSCs constructed using photoanodes made of bare TiO2 and Ni-doped TiO2 were investigated (thickness around 15.3 μm). The plots of current density (J) versus potential (V) for the prepared cells are shown in Fig. 9. Table 3 lists the relevant characteristic parameters of the DSSCs. The solar conversion efficiency (η) and JSC of Ni-doped TiO2 were found to be greater than those of bare TiO2. 4% Ni-doped TiO2 had the greatest photovoltaic performance of all the Ni-doped TiO2 because of its anatase phase (in terms of device efficiency, anatase's energy levels are more suited to greater device performance).120–124 This result can be attributed to the higher number of adsorbed molecules at the same time. Increased absorption of visible light may make sunshine more useful (Fig. S5, ESI†). Nonetheless, the VOC of Ni–TiO2 is larger than that of bare TiO2. The low efficiency of the DSSC with 6% Ni–TiO2 might be due to a lack of connection between the sheet/sphere-like particles, resulting in poor electron transport. Further, POBA dye showed lower efficiency (1.85%) than Z907 dye (4.52%) utilizing the 4% Ni–TiO2 photoanode. The low efficiency of POBA dye was mainly due to the dye's self-quenching process, the recombination mechanism, and the intermolecular π–π stacking aggregation.

In order to co-sensitize the 4% Ni–TiO2 anode material, different concentrations of POBA were co-sensitized after the photoanode was dipped in 0.5 mM Z907 dye. Co-sensitization with POBA effectively increased the JSC and VOC of the DSSC to an optimum point (i.e. 0.5 mM). Co-sensitized DSSCs showed efficiencies of 4.98%, 5.77%, and 5.06% for POBA concentrations of 0.3 mM, 0.5 mM, and 0.7 mM, respectively (Table S3, ESI†). The decrease in PCE value for the 0.7 mM POBA concentration based co-sensitized DSSC may be due to the competitive adsorption of the POBA and the Z907 dye as well as the aggregation of POBA itself. Finally, it was determined that 0.5 mM was the ideal concentration for POBA for co-sensitization. From the J–V graph of the co-sensitized device (Fig. 9), it can be noted that the co-sensitized device outperformed that of Z907 alone in terms of performance. The DSSC having both Z907 and POBA exhibited a PCE of 5.77%, while that with Z907 alone had an efficiency of 4.52%. The better performance of the co-sensitized device can be attributed to its enhanced JSC and VOC values. The enhanced VOC value (0.73 V) for the Z907 + POBA device may be due to the adsorption of POBA dye in the vacant spaces available on the bulky Z907 dye adsorbed TiO2 surface. As a result, the VOC value was improved by the co-sensitization technique. In order to more thoroughly examine the co-sensitization impact of POBA, absorption spectra of the DSSCs co-sensitized with Z907 and POBA anchored on 4% Ni–TiO2 were also measured and are depicted in Fig. S8 (ESI†). When compared with the Z907 anchored 4% Ni–TiO2 DSSC, it is noteworthy that in the range of 300–440 nm, the co-sensitized photoanode showed superior absorption spectra. In conclusion, POBA provided the strongest co-sensitization effect since it raised VOC by reducing unfavourable charge recombination, and increased JSC by a sufficient expansion of both light harvesting capabilities and an improved fill factor.
3.9. EIS analysis of DSSCs

Fig. 10 depicts the EIS spectra of the DSSCs, whereas the inset of Fig. 10 depicts their equivalent circuit. In general, three arcs represent a typical impedance spectrum of DSSCs (semicircles). Charge transfer in the counter electrode (high frequency), electron recombination and diffusion in the TiO2 conduction band (intermediate frequency), and diffusion of electrolytes in solution (low frequency) are the three semicircles that can be allocated.125,126 Only one semicircle was found in our investigation, and this behaviour may be explained by charge collecting in the photoanode. Because all cells produced poor charge collection, only a modest amount of charge is transferred to the counter electrode, preventing semicircle development at high frequencies. The diameter of this semicircle is related to the resistance of the photoanode interface. When charge recombination resistance increases, the VOC of the device also increases.127 We can see that interface resistance follows the sequence of Cell 1 < Cell 2 < Cell 4 < Cell 3 < Cell 5 < Cell 6 in Fig. 10, which is consistent with the VOC values in Table 3. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) for the POBA dye based device (4% Ni–TiO2) was determined to be around 287.11 Ω using EIS. This low Rct suggests that at the interface of photoanode and electrolyte, there is a lot of dark current and a high rate of charge recombination. The Rct of Cell 6 has a better resistance to recombination of charges, resulting in a longer lifetime of electron transport, as indicated by the enhanced PCE, as shown in Table 3 and Fig. 10. It was also observed that Cells 1 to 5 had lower Rct values than that of Cell 6, proving the co-sensitization method's efficacy. The enhancement in electron lifespan caused by co-sensitization might be attributed to the dye on TiO2 increasing its surface coverage. Because of the dye's great surface coverage, fewer electrolyte molecules reach the TiO2, which reduces recombination and thus enhances the PCE of the co-sensitized device.128,129

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, we designed and synthesized a novel phenothiazine-based dye named POBA dye with phenothiazine as the donating moiety and an acid functional group as the acceptor moiety. The synthesized dye was characterized using IR, NMR, and mass spectral analysis. Also, TiO2 and Ni-doped TiO2 were synthesized, characterized, and studied using XRD and TEM analysis. Moreover, different concentrations of ionic liquid doped PVDF-PEG gel polymer electrolytes were prepared and their conductivity was examined. Further, DSSCs were fabricated using highly conductive polymer electrolytes and exhibited efficiency up to 1.85% with the POBA containing 4% Ni–TiO2 photoanode. When all J–V characteristics were compared, the co-sensitized Z907 + POBA device had a higher JSC (11.15 mA cm−2) because of the dyes’ maximum absorption of light and the proper loading of dyes, a higher VOC (0.73 V) due to enhanced surface coverage of TiO2 and reduced recombination of charge, and a higher fill factor of 71%. We expect that fine-tuning the molecular architectures of simple organic sensitizers will lead to an enhancement of the efficiency of co-sensitized DSSCs.
