    AbstractEmerging alternative photovoltaic technologies such as dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and organic solar cells (OSCs) have recently gained much attention as well as maturity and are on the step of being commercialized. Bulk heterojunction hybrid solar cells containing inorganic nanoparticles and semiconducting polymers are still lagging behind in respect of device performance although they have theoretically the potential to exhibit better performances than devices containing solely organic compounds. In this article we review the recent state of the art development of bulk heterojunction hybrid solar cells. Critical factors limiting the solar cell device performance are highlighted and strategies for further device improvement are demonstrated by giving recent examples from literature.Yunfei ZhouYunfei Zhou received his BS degree in physics in 2004, and ME degree in optical engineering in 2006 from Sun Yat-sen University, China.

Broader context
Hybrid organic photovoltaics based on blends of inorganic nanoparticles and conjugated polymers as photoactive layers are still lagging behind organic photovoltaics based on fullerenes and conjugated polymers in respect of device performance. Nevertheless in recent years quite some progress occurred. In principle hybrid organic photovoltaics has the potential to exceed in performance beyond the one of organic photovoltaics while having all the benefits such as low-cost, thin and flexible and easy to produce. Recent progresses and critical factors limiting the solar cell device performance are highlighted in this review article as well as strategies for further device improvement are demonstrated with recent examples from literature.

1. Introduction
Photovoltaic (PV) energy conversion is attracting more and more attention as the need for renewable energy sources replacing current environmental critical technologies becomes more urgent. PV is an attractive way of producing electrical energy directly from sunlight, without producing noise, toxic substances and greenhouse gas emission, while requiring very little maintenance. PV technologies have found markets in various fields, ranging from consumer electronics and small scale distributed power systems to megawatt scale power plants. Currently, the PV market is still dominated by crystalline silicon wafer based solar cells, so-called first generation solar cells. The best single crystalline silicon solar cells have shown power conversion efficiencies (PCEs, defined as the percentage of maximum output of electrical power to the incident light power) of about 25%.1 Commercial products typically achieve module efficiencies of about 15–18%.2 However, silicon wafers are fragile, making the manufacturing processes complex limiting potential applications. In addition, high purity crystalline silicon wafers are very expensive, resulting in inherently high-cost and it may take several years to gain the payback for their purchasing and installation costs. In order to simplify manufacturing and reduce costs, second generation solar cells, which are mostly associated with thin film solar cells, were developed. Second generation solar cells are much cheaper to produce than first generation cells since they are fabricated by depositing thin films of photoactive materials on substrates, using less materials and cheaper manufacturing processes. Copper Indium Gallium Selenide (CIGS), CdTe, amorphous silicon (a-Si), and nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si) are the most commonly used materials.3 However, the PCEs remain lower than for the first generation solar cells, and the promise of low cost power has not been realized yet. Third generation solar cells are the cutting edge of solar technology and still in the research phase. They are expected to achieve reasonable efficiencies at lower costs than first and second generation technologies4 and contain a wide range of promising technologies including multijunction tandem cells,5 dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),6 organic solar cells based on small-molecule7,8 and conjugated polymer,9–17 and organic/inorganic hybrid solar cells.16,18–21Fig. 1 summarises the progress of the best research-cell PCEs based on various materials and technologies updated till June 2010.

Generally, PV technologies are currently dominated by inorganic semiconductor based solar cells. However, the manufacturing processes of traditional inorganic solar cells often involve elevated temperature, high vacuum, and numerous lithographic steps, resulting in high production costs and energy consumption. Alternatively, solar cells based on organic materials such as small molecules and conjugated polymers offer a cost-effective way to convert solar energy into electricity. In contrast to their inorganic counterparts, organic solar cells (OSCs) have several advantages. They are able to be manufactured by low-temperature processing: either from small molecules from the vapor phase, or polymers from solution. The organic materials are relatively inexpensive, and only 100–200 nm thick films are required due to the high optical absorption capabilities of organic semiconductors. Additionally, roll-to-roll processing like low cost printing techniques22 can be used for manufacturing. In Fig. 2a a photograph is shown illustrating a roll-to-roll manufacturing machine for fabricating flexible polymer solar cells.23 Therefore, OSCs have the promising potential to be applied in consumer products with the features of thin, flexible, light weight and low cost. Additionally, the properties of small molecules or polymers can be tailored by modifying their chemical composition, resulting in greater customization than traditional inorganic solar cells. Since Tang's pioneering work on the bilayer heterojunction OSC reported in 1986,24 intensive investigation has been performed and the PCEs of devices have been improved substantially. Currently, OSCs with small active area have reached a PCE level above 7%25 approaching 8% (announcement by Solarmer Energy Inc. with a certified PCE of 7.9%26), which are close to the requirement for entering the business market.27 Several companies such as Konarka, Heliatek, Solarmer, and Plextronics have already started or are preparing to make commercial available products to offer alternative inexpensive solar power modules. It has to be mentioned that the PCEs of solar power modules based on OSCs are currently in the range of 2–4%. For example, solar bags with a polymer based OSC panel on the surface are already commercially available on the market based on the technology developed by Konarka.28 They are able to provide electricity to charge mobile phones and other handheld devices from solar power (shown in Fig. 2b). The light-weight, thin-film photovoltaic material is much more versatile for various applications than traditional solar panels.

Conjugated polymers generally have relatively high hole mobilities but low electron mobilities. This intrinsic imbalance in carrier mobility can be overcome by the incorporation of an n-type semiconductor material as electron acceptor to provide a pathway for electron transport. Fullerene derivatives (e.g. [6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)) are the most commonly used electron acceptor materials in polymer solar cells.29 Solar cells based on conjugated polymer and fullerene derivatives exhibit state-of-the-art PCEs up to 7–8%.25Fig. 3a shows some structures of semiconducting organic materials commonly used in polymer solar cells and Fig. 3b illustrates different shapes of inorganic semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) used in hybrid solar cells as electron acceptor materials such as spherical quantum dots (QDs), nanorods (NRs) and tetrapods (TPs). They exhibit size dependent absorption properties based on quantum confinement which is demonstrated in Fig. 3c for CdSe QDs.

2. Hybrid solar cells
Replacing the fullerenes as organic nanoparticles by inorganic NCs such as colloidal inorganic semiconductor NCs as electron acceptors is an alternative approach leading to so-called hybrid solar cells.19–21,30,31 NCs based on CdS, CdSe, CdTe, ZnO, SnO2, TiO2, Si, PbS and PbSe have been used so far as electron acceptors. Colloidal NCs synthesized in organic media are usually soluble in common organic solvents thus they are able to be incorporated into conjugated polymers which are soluble in the same solvents. By tuning the diameter of the NCs, their band gap as well as their energy level can be varied based on the quantum size effect.32 As shown in Fig. 3c, along with the increasing size of the CdSe NCs from about 3 nm to 6 nm, the band gap is reduced, resulting in light absorption at longer wavelength. Furthermore, quantum confinement leads to an enhancement of the absorption coefficient compared to that of the bulk materials.33 As a result, in the NCs/polymer system, both components have the ability to absorb incident light, unlike the typical polymer/fullerene system where the fullerene contributes very little to the photocurrent generation.34,35 In addition, NCs can provide stable preformed structures on the length scale of 2–100 nm with desirable exciton dissociation and charge transport properties.36 The device structure and principle of hybrid solar cells are similar to that of the polymer solar cells and are described later in detail.
In this review, we will focus on bulk heterojunction hybrid solar cells based on colloidal NCs and conjugated polymers. Recent state-of-the-art results will be summarized and concepts for improving the device performance are highlighted.
2.1. Device structure and working principle
NC/polymer hybrid solar cells usually have a similar device architecture as organic solar cells, i.e. a thin film device consisting of photoactive layer(s) between two electrodes of different work functions (see Fig. 4a). High work function, conductive and transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) on a flexible plastic or glass substrate is often used as anode. The conducting polymer poly(3,4-alkenedioxythiophenes):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is usually used as anode buffer material for smoothing the ITO surface, enhancing the adhesion to the upper light absorbing layer, and improving the device stability by hindering oxygen and indium diffusion through the anode.37–39 The photoactive layer is usually made by spin-coating a NC/polymer blend solution onto the ITO substrate to form a thin-film of around 100–200 nm. Finally, a top metal electrode (e.g. Al, LiF/Al and Ca/Al) is vacuum deposited onto the photoactive layer. In contrast to bulk inorganic semiconductors, optical absorption in organic semiconductor materials as well as in NCs does not generate directly free charge carriers, but strongly bound electron–hole pairs so-called excitons.40 Since the exciton diffusion lengths in conjugated polymers are typically around 10–20 nm,41–43 the optimum distance of the exciton to the donor/acceptor (D/A) interface, where charge transfer takes place and excitons dissociate into free charge carriers, should be in the same length range. This can be realized by a so-called bulk-heterojunction structure44,45 as shown in Fig. 4b. The bulk-heterojunction composite is made by mixing both the electron donor and acceptor intimately together, thus the interfacial area is dramatically increased and the distance that excitons have to travel to reach the interface is reduced. After exciton dissociation into free charge carriers, holes and electrons are transported via polymer and NCs percolation pathways towards the respective electrodes. The nanoscale phase separation in a thin composite film containing 87.5 wt% CdSe QDs and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) measured by transmission electron spectroscopy (TEM) is shown in Fig. 4c as an example. A TEM image of the cross-section of a film containing 40 wt% CdSe NRs (7 nm in diameter and 60 nm in length) mixed with P3HT36 is also shown (Fig. 4d).

Similar to organic solar cells, photocurrent generation is a multistep process in NC–polymer hybrid bulk heterojunction solar cells, as demonstrated in Fig. 5. The physics of organic/hybrid solar cells is reviewed in detail elsewhere.10,20,31 In short, there are following four main steps which have to be considered: photon absorption, exciton diffusion, charge transfer, and charge carrier transport and collection.

(a) Schematics of the different energy levels and the individual processes: exciton generation (1), exciton diffusion (2), charge transfer (3), charge carrier transport and collection (4). (b) Schematic of a bulk-heterojunction contact at the polymer–NC interface. The same processes mentioned in (a) are illustrated directly at the donor–acceptor interface. 

2.1.1. Photon absorption. 
First, incident photons with an energy hν are absorbed by the donor polymer material and partially also from the inorganic NCs and excite the electrons from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level, creating excitons with a certain binding energy (typically 200–500 meV46,47). For example in blends containing 90 wt% CdSe nanoparticles in P3HT, about 60% of the total absorbed light energy can be attributed to P3HT due to the strong absorption coefficient.48


2.1.2. Exciton diffusion. 
In order to generate separated negative and positive charges, the excitons need to diffuse to the D/A interface. Since excitons are neutral species, their motion is not affected by any electric field and they diffuse via random hops driven by the concentration gradient. Note that the exciton diffusion lengths are typically around 10–20 nm41–43 for most conjugated polymers before recombination takes place. Excitons that do not reach the D/A interface are lost for the energy conversion and have no contribution to the photocurrent.


2.1.3. Charge transfer. 
Excitons dissociate at the D/A interface by charge transfer which is energetically favored (Fig. 5a): the LUMO level of the NCs is lower than that of the polymer, and the HOMO level of the polymer is higher than that of the NCs. The offsets in both HOMO and LUMO levels must be larger than the exciton binding energy minus the columbic binding energy of the charge-separated state.49 The energy levels (in eV) of commonly used conjugated polymers as donor and NCs as acceptor are shown as examples in Fig. 6, and the Fermi levels of the electrodes are also shown. The variation of the values for the energy levels derived from ref. 50–61 is due to different applied measurement methods for extracting the respective values of the HOMO–LUMO levels such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), and due to different experimental boundary conditions.
 Fig. 6  Energy levels (in eV) of commonly used conjugated polymers and semiconductor NCs, as well as the electrode Fermi levels (in eV). Values are taken from ref. 50–61. Values for CdSe are 4.8 nm QD (ref. 55) and 4.6 nm QD (ref. 60), respectively. ZnO values correspond to NRs with diameters of 55 nm (ref. 56) and 100 nm (ref. 57), respectively. In the literature values published for the energy levels of the donor and acceptor materials differ slightly depending on e.g. different applied experimental methods to extract the HOMO–LUMO levels such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and due to different experimental boundary conditions. 


2.1.4. Charge carrier transport and collection. 
In the final step, once charge transfer has occurred at the D/A interface, separated holes and electrons are distributed within the donor and acceptor phases, respectively. Holes and electrons are then transported towards their respective electrode driven by an internal electric field deriving from the Fermi level difference of the electrodes with efficiencies depending on their mobilities during the hopping process, and consequently being collected at the respective electrodes.

2.2. Device characterization
PCE is one of the most import parameter to characterize solar cell performances. It is defined as the percentage of maximum output of electrical power to the incident light power. Fig. 7 shows a schematic of a current density–voltage (J–V) characteristic for a typical hybrid solar cell in the dark and under illumination. The PCE can be described as (1)where Pm is maximum power point, Pin is the incident light intensity, Jsc is the short-circuit current density, and Voc is the open-circuit voltage, and FF is the fill factor, which is defined as the ratio of Pm to the product of Jsc and Voc. (2)
 Fig. 7  Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristic of a typical solar cell in the dark (dashed line) and under illumination (solid line). Typical solar cell parameters such as short-circuit current density Jsc, open-circuit voltage Voc, and the maximum power point Pm are illustrated on the graph. 
In order to compare results from various devices, solar cells are characterized based on international accepted standard reporting conditions (SRCs), which are referred to a cell temperature of 25 °C under air mass 1.5 global (AM1.5G) illumination spectrum at an intensity of 1000 W m−2. This AM1.5G condition corresponds to the spectrum and irradiance of sunlight incident upon an inclined plane at 37° tilt towards the equator with an elevation of 41.81° above the horizon.62 External quantum efficiency (EQE) is another important parameter for solar cell characterization. It is calculated by the number of electrons extracted in an external circuit divided by the number of incident photons at a certain wavelength under short-circuit condition. (3)where λ is the wavelength, e is the elementary charge, h is the Planck constant, and c is the speed of light in vacuum.
Several different colloidal inorganic semiconductor NCs have been investigated as electron acceptors in hybrid solar cells with promising results, such as CdSe,36,48,63–78 CdS,79,80 CdTe,81,82 ZnO,57,83–96 TiO2,97–107 PbSe,108,109 PbS,110–112 SnO2,113–116 Si,117,118 CuInS2,119etc. The blends of NCs and polymer are normally prepared by spin-coating a solution which contains dissolved polymer and suspended nanoparticles.
2.3. Devices based on CdSe NCs
CdSe NCs were the first NCs being incorporated into solar cells which still exhibit the highest PCEs compared to devices with NCs from other materials, and are still under extensive studies for utilization in hybrid solar cells. CdSe NCs have some advantages: they absorb at a useful spectral range for harvesting solar emission (shown in Fig. 3c), they are good electron acceptors in combination with conjugated polymers, and the synthetic methods for their synthesis are well-established. In 1996, Greenham et al.76 firstly reported on the incorporation of CdSe spherical quantum dots (QDs) into poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MEH-PPV). At a high concentration of NCs of around 90% by weight (wt%), external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) up to 10% were achieved, indicating an efficient exciton dissociation at the polymer/NCs interface. Although the phase separation between the polymer and the NCs was observed to be in the range of 10–200 nm, the PCEs of devices were very low of about 0.1%. This was attributed to an inefficient electron transport via hopping from NCs to NCs. After the breakthrough synthetic work of Peng et al.,120 shape control of CdSe NCs was introduced and different elongated CdSe structures were obtainable. Numerous approaches were published regarding synthesizing various morphologies and structures of CdSe NCs and their application in hybrid solar cells. A significant advance was reported in 2002 by Huynh et al.,36 who demonstrated efficient hybrid solar cells based on elongated CdSe nanorods and P3HT. Elongated nanorods were used which naturally provide direct pathways for effective electron transport.48 Additionally, P3HT was used as donor material since it has a comparatively high hole mobility and absorbs at a longer wavelength range compared to PPV derivatives.121 By increasing the nanorod length, improved electron transport properties were demonstrated resulting in an improvement of the EQE (Fig. 8a). The optimized devices consisting of 90 wt% pyridine treated nanorods (7 nm in diameter and 60 nm in length) and P3HT exhibited an EQE over 54% and a PCE of 1.7%. Fig. 8b shows a J–V characteristic of an optimized device under AM1.5G illumination. This work highlights the importance of shape control of materials on the nanometre scale, which opens new opportunities for the development of future generation solar cells. Later on, numerous literatures have been published for hybrid solar cells based on conjugated polymers and spherical quantum dots (QDs),65,68,74,75 nanorods (NRs),36,67,69,70,77 tetrapods (TPs)63,71–74 and hyperbranched64 CdSe NCs, exhibiting the highest PCEs of 2.0%,75 2.6%,70 3.2%,63 and 2.2%,64 respectively. The selected performance parameters of hybrid solar cells based on CdSe NCs and conjugated polymers are summarized in Table 1.

2.4. Strategies for PCE improvement

2.4.1 NC surface modification. 
In principle, polymer/NC hybrid solar cells should perform better compared to polymer/fullerene systems due to the additional higher absorption coefficient of inorganic semiconductor NCs and potential higher intrinsic electron mobility compared to that of PCBM (10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (ref. 122)). Nevertheless, there has been no higher PCEs reported in hybrid solar cells compared to fullerene based OSCs so far. One important reason is that despite the relatively high intrinsic conductivity within the individual NCs, the electron mobility transport through the NC network in hybrid solar cells is quite low, which could be mainly attributed to the electrical insulating organic ligands on the NC surface.75 In most cases, the ligands used for preventing aggregation during the growth of the NCs contain long alkyl chains, such as oleic acid (OA) or trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO), which form electrically insulating layers thus impedes an efficient charge transfer between NCs and polymer, as well as electron transport between NCs.76,78 Ginger and Greenham123 have investigated charge injection and charge transfer in thin films of spherical CdSe NCs covered with TOPO ligand sandwiched between two metal electrodes. Very low electron mobilities in the order of 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 were measured, whereas the electron mobility of bulk CdSe is in the order of 102 cm2 V−1 s−1.124 In order to overcome this problem, extensive investigations on the surface modification of NCs have been reported based on ligand exchange approaches using various shorter capping ligands. The interparticle distance is expected to be reduced, thus facilitating the electron transport through the NC domain phases. For example, post-synthetic pyridine treatment of the NCs is the most commonly used and effective procedure, leading to the state-of-the-art efficiencies for hybrid solar cells.36,63–67,70–74 Generally, as-synthesized NCs are washed by methanol several times and consequently refluxed in pure pyridine at the boiling point of pyridine around 115 °C under inert atmosphere overnight. Afterwards, the NCs are precipitated with hexanes, recovered by centrifugation, and then dispersed into a mixture of chloroform/pyridine (90:10, v/v) solvent. This pyridine treatment is believed to replace the synthetic insulating ligand with shorter and more conductive pyridine molecules. Treatments with other materials such as chloride,125 amine,68 and thiols126,127 were also investigated. Aldakov et al.127 systematically investigated CdSe NCs modified by various small ligand molecules with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), optical spectroscopy and electrochemistry, although their hybrid devices exhibited low efficiencies. Olson et al.68 reported on CdSe/P3HT blended devices exhibiting PCEs up to 1.77% when butylamine was used as a shorter capping ligand for the NCs. In an alternative approach, shortening of the insulating ligands by thermal decomposition was demonstrated and led to a relative improvement of the PCEs of the CdSe/P3HT-based solar cells.69 However, NCs after ligand exchange with small molecules tend to aggregate and precipitate out from the organic solvent once the long alkyl chain ligands are replaced,36,128 resulting in difficulties to obtain stable mixtures of NCs and polymer. Recently, we have demonstrated a novel post-synthetic treatment on spherical CdSe QDs with non-ligand-exchange approach,75 where the NCs were treated by a simple and fast hexanoic acid-assisted washing procedure. Devices with optimized ratios of QDs to P3HT exhibited reproducible PCEs up to 2% after spectral mismatch correction which could meanwhile be exceeded (Fig. 9a). This is the highest reported value for a CdSe QDs based hybrid solar cell so far. It is notable that the FF is relatively high up to 0.54, implying a good charge carrier transport capability in the devices. A simple reduced ligand sphere model was proposed to explain the possible reason for improved photovoltaic device efficiencies after acid treatment as shown in Fig. 9b. By the assistance of hexanoic acid these “immobilized” insulating spheres formed by hexadecylamine (HDA) ligand are effectively reduced in size due to the salt formation of HDA. This organic salt is also much more easily dissolved in the supernatant solution than unprotonated HDA and can be separated easily from the QDs by subsequent centrifugation. Another advantage of avoiding the exchange of the synthesis capping ligands is that the QDs retain a good solubility after acid treatment, resulting in reproducible performance as well as allowing a high loading of the CdSe QDs in the blend, which is preferable for an efficient percolation network formation during the annealing of the photoactive composite film.

2.4.2 Polymer functionalization. 
From the polymer side, modifications such as end-group functionalization have been demonstrated as a route for improving the dispersion in solvents and electronic interaction between polymer and NCs.129 Liu et al.67 have shown that pyridine-treated CdSe NRs can form well dispersed composite films with amine-terminated regioregular P3HT, exhibiting a maximum PCE of 1.4%. The end-group amine-functionalized P3HT is expected to provide intimate contact between NCs and polymer through covalent interactions, and thereby enhancing the NRs miscibility with P3HT, resulting in a favorable morphology improving the charge transfer between them. Other approaches to end-group functionalization of P3HT such as using H/(–SH), H/Br, and Br/allyl as terminating chemical groups have been reported.130 Hybrid solar cells with CdSe QDs and Br/allyl-terminated and H/(–SH)-terminated P3HT led to efficiencies of 0.9% and 0.6%, respectively. Zhang et al.131 have demonstrated a route for directly attaching P3HT on CdSe NR surfaces, by coupling vinyl-terminated P3HT to CdSe NRs with arylbromide-functionalized phosphine oxides and thiols. Additionally, the direct synthesis of uncapped NCs inside the polymer phase is expected as an ideal situation, since the effects of the capping ligand on charge transfer and charge transport are eliminated and the step for transferring NCs to the polymer solution can be bypassed. Dayal et al.132 have reported on the direct synthesis of homogeneously dispersed CdSe QDs in a P3HT solution. Photoinduced charge separation was observed, indicating that this composite could be a promising material for hybrid solar cells.


2.4.3 Photon absorption. 
In order to harvest the maximum possible amount of the solar energy, absorption of a large fraction of the incident photons is required. Previous work mostly focused on systems based on CdSe NCs and P3HT as a high hole mobility polymer. For examples, by using P3HT as donor material, hybrid solar cells with spherical QDs, NRs, and hyperbranched CdSe NCs exhibited the best efficiencies of 2.0%,75 2.6%,70,77 and 2.2%,64 respectively. However, due to the poor overlap between the P3HT absorption spectrum and the solar emission spectrum,61,62 further improvement on PCEs seems to be difficult to obtain with this polymer system. Fig. 10 shows the photons flux and its integral AM1.5G conditions (the AM1.5G solar irradiance data are taken from National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)133). Two different scales are shown on the right side: one axis shows the integral from 280–4000 nm of the number of photons which can be absorbed by having a certain band gap. The second axis shows the maximum theoretical Jsc calculated by assuming that all photons are absorbed up to the band gap and converted into electrons without any losses (e.g. EQE is constant 1). Crystalline silicon has a band gap of 1.1 eV and can absorb up to 64% of the photons under AM1.5G illumination, with a theoretical achievable current density Jsc of about 45 mA cm−2, while in the case of P3HT having a band gap of 1.85 eV, only 27% photons can be absorbed, resulting in a maximal Jsc of 19 mA cm−2. By using the low band gap polymer PCPDTBT with a band gap of about 1.4 eV, more photons can be absorbed theoretically, leading to a maximum Jsc up to 32 mA cm−2.
 Fig. 10  AM1.5G photons flux (black) and the integrated values (red) of photons as well as the maximum theoretically achievable short circuit current densities as a function of the maximal absorbed wavelengths (which result from the band-gap of the respective material). Crystalline silicon, P3HT, and PCPDTBT are shown as examples for comparison. 
Therefore, polymers with a smaller band gap absorbing at longer wavelengths are promising donor materials to increase the PCE of devices. Dennler et al.9 demonstrated that for a minimum energy offset of 0.3 eV between the donor and acceptor LUMO level, PCEs of >10% are practically available for a donor polymer with an ideal optical band gap of ∼1.4 eV. Most low band gap polymers are from the material classes of thiophene, fluorene, carbazole, and cyclopentadithiophene based polymers, which are reviewed in detail elsewhere.9,61,134 Among those low band gap polymers, poly[2,6-(4,4-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b]-dithiophene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PCPDTBT, chemical structure shown in Fig. 3) with a band gap of ∼1.4 eV and a relatively high hole mobility up to 1.5 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 (ref. 135) appears to be an excellent candidate as a photon-absorbing and electron donating material.136 OSCs based on PCPDTBT:PC70BM system achieved already efficiencies up to 5.5%137 and 6.1%.138 Recently, a bulk-heterojunction hybrid solar cell based on CdSe tetrapods and PCPDTBT was reported by Dayal et al.63 with a certified PCE of 3.13% (measured by NREL). This is up to date the highest efficiency for colloidal NCs based bulk-heterojunction hybrid solar cells. As shown in Fig. 11, devices out of PCPDTBT and CdSe tetrapods exhibited an EQE of >30% in a broad range from 350 nm to 800 nm, which is the absorption band of the polymer. It is notable that the devices reached very high Jsc values above 10 mA cm−2, indicating that the broad absorption ability of the photoactive hybrid film consequently contributes to the photocurrent.
 Fig. 11  EQE and absorption spectra of a device containing CdSe tetrapods and PCPDTBT exceeding a PCE of 3% (reproduced from ref. 63). 
It should be noted that lowering the band gap of photo-absorbing materials below a certain limit will lead to a decrease in efficiency, because the maximum Voc is limited by the band gap. In addition, the energy of absorbed photons with a larger energy than the band gap will be wasted as the electrons and holes relax to the band edges. This limitation might be overcome by multiple exciton generation in semiconductor NCs, where a single high-energy absorbed photon can produce multiple electron–hole pairs. This phenomenon has been studied using PbSe, CdSe, and PbS NCs.139–141 Very high efficiencies exceeding 42% for solar cells with NCs having a band gap of 0.45 eV are theoretically possible, assuming that additional carriers from multiple exciton generation can be extracted efficiently.142 Nevertheless the contribution of multiple exciton generation in inorganic NCs to the solar cell efficiency is quite controversial in literature up to date143 since initial results could not be verified and it needs furthermore convincing experimental verification. So far there is no practical evidence that the additional carriers can be extracted quickly enough to compete with the rapid exciton recombination processes within the NCs.


2.4.4 Control of the nanomorphology. 
Generally, by controlling the morphology of the active layer, the performance of bulk-heterojunction solar cells can be increased, because the efficient charge transfer, transport and collection strongly depend on the nanoscale morphology of the composite film.144,145 For example, the crystallization of P3HT, induced during a thermal annealing step during device preparation, improves the absorption property and hole mobility of the polymer.146–148 There are many factors which can have an influence on the formation of phase separated morphologies in the polymer/NC blends, including the different solubilities of polymers and NCs in solvents, differential evaporation in solvent mixtures, NC aggregation in concentrated solutions, entropic effects, spinodal decomposition, convective instabilities during spin coating, and surface energies at the substrate and air interfaces.31
Huynh et al.78 have investigated intensively the morphology control in P3HT/CdSe NC hybrid solar cells. Solvent mixtures of chloroform and pyridine were demonstrated as an effective way to control the morphology of polymer/NCs films. The nanoscale phase separation between NCs and polymer could be adjusted by varying the concentration of the solvent mixture. An optimum concentration for pyridine in chloroform of about 8% by volume was observed. Thermal annealing has been found to be an effective method to control the nanoscale morphology of photoactive films thus enhancing the performance of hybrid solar cells.68,78 Besides the effect of polymer crystallization, the strong enhancement of the photocurrent after annealing is explained by removal of both interfacial and excess ligands, which act as a barrier for charge transfer from polymer to NCs and NCs to NCs. Furthermore, ligands can act as non-radiative recombination sites for excitons in the polymer.78
In addition, using suitable solvents for processing NC/polymer blends has been demonstrated as another crucial approach for nanomorphology control. Sun and Greenham70 reported on an improved PCE of P3HT/CdSe nanorod devices by using the high boiling point solvent 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB). Fig. 12 shows the comparison of EQE (a) and J–V characteristics (b) for devices fabricated by using TCB, thiophene, and chloroform as solvents for the materials during the spin coating of the respective photoactive layers. By using TCB as solvent, the EQE and the Jsc of the device have significantly improved. It is proposed that the slow evaporation rate during the spin-coating process results in a favorable ordering of P3HT, which improves the hole mobility. By using branched CdSe NCs, e.g. tetrapods and poly(2-methoxy-5-(3′,7′-dimethyloctyloxy)-p-phenylenevinylene) (OC1C10-PPV) as the donor polymer processed with high boiling point solvent TCB, further improvement on the PCE up to 2.8% has been achieved.72 It is explained that the tetrapods seem to preferentially segregate towards the vertical direction to the electrodes, which is beneficial for efficient electron transport through the NC phases.
 Fig. 12  (a) EQEs of hybrid solar cells with 90 wt% CdSe NRs and P3HT fabricated by using chloroform (solid line), thiophene (dashed line) and TCB (dotted line) as solvents for the materials during the spin coating process. (b) J–V characteristics for the same devices under AM1.5G illumination (reproduced from ref. 70). 
Similar to thermal annealing, solvent annealing is another effective way to improve the device performance, while the film is still in the liquid phase after spin-coating stored in a confined volume (such as a glass Petri dish) allowing the solvent to evaporate very slowly.148,149 Recently, Wu et al.77 have demonstrated an approach to enhance the charge separation and charge transport by using chemical vapor annealing treatment. The film of pyridine treated CdSe NRs mixed with P3HT was put in a closed glass vessel while the film was still wet. Benzene-1,3-dithiol was then added at the bottom edge of the vessel and the whole vessel was heated under 120 °C for 20 min. Compared to the non-treated devices, the PCEs have been significantly improved from 1.56% to 2.65%, along with an enhancement of Jsc from 5.8 mA cm−2 to 9.7 mA cm−2. The effective ligand exchange reaction and related phase separation during the annealing process are suggested to be the responsible reason for the performance enhancement.
Ideally, an interdigital donor acceptor configuration would be a perfect structure for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport (Fig. 13). In such an ideal structure, the distance from exciton generation sites, either in the donor or the acceptor phase, to the D/A interface would be in the range of the exciton diffusion length. After exciton dissociation, both holes and electrons would be transported within their pre-structured donor or acceptor phases and find their direct percolation pathway to the respective electrodes easily. One way to approach this nanostructure is to use a polymer brush as the electron donor in the device, where polymer chains are grown directly from a substrate.150,151 Snaith et al.150 have demonstrated polyacrylate brushes with triphenylamine side groups grown onto ITO substrates, showing improved hole transport properties compared to spin-coated films of the same polymer. Afterwards the brushes were soaked in the CdSe NCs solution, resulting in a nanostructured photoactive layer. Although the PCEs of devices are relatively low due to the insufficient light absorption from a large band gap polymer, internal quantum efficiencies as high as 50% were measured, indicating good exciton dissociation and charge collection properties within the nanostructured film. More practically, He et al.152 have demonstrated a nano-imprinting process to form a nanostructured polymer blend film which demonstrated substantial improvement of the device performance. The spin-coated film of the electron donor P3HT was firstly patterned by a structured Si mold, as shown in Fig. 13b. Then the patterned P3HT film was used as a mold in the second imprinting step for the acceptor polymer poly((9,9-dioctylfluorene)-2,7-diyl-alt-[4,7-bis(3-hexylthien-5-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole]-2′,2″-diyl) (F8TBT), which was spin-coated on a thermally evaporated Al cathode. This so-called double imprinting process can produce an interdigitated polymer bilayer film with a precisely defined structure. The smallest feature sizes of nanostructure are as small as 25 nm on a 50 nm pitch, leading to the distance between neighboring heterojunctions at or below the exciton diffusion length. OSCs with optimized interpenetrating nanostructure exhibited PCEs of 1.9%, which is among the best for polymer–polymer blend devices. Although only few systematic approaches have been reported, such kind of device structuring could be also applied to hybrid solar cells.

In addition, three dimensional TEM tomography has been demonstrated helpful to get feedback about the nanoscale morphology towards understanding the structure–function relations.153 For bulk heterojunction solar cells this method delivers the possibility of an accurate three dimensional analysis of the nanophase distribution of the donor–acceptor blend. Therefore, charge extraction pathways as well as the volume fractions of donor and acceptor phase can be completely visualized. Oosterhout et al.91 demonstrated the visualization of P3HT/ZnO NC bulk heterojunction nanoscale morphologies in three dimensions (Fig. 14). By statistically analyzing the three-dimensional morphology, information about the spherical contact distance and percolation pathways can be extracted, obtaining a consistent and quantitative correlation between device performance and nanoscale morphology.

3. Hybrid solar cells based on other semiconductor NCs
ZnO NCs have also attracted a lot of attention for being used in hybrid solar cells because they are less toxic than typical II–VI semiconductors and are relatively easy to synthesize in large quantities. Devices based on blends of poly[2-methoxy-5-(3′,7′-dimethyloctyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MDMO-PPV) and ZnO NCs at an optimized NC content (67 wt%) presented the best PCE of 1.4%.94 By using P3HT as donor polymer which has higher hole mobility, the efficiency was optimized up to 2% with a composite film containing 50 wt% ZnO NCs.91 However, because of the relatively large band gap, the contribution to the absorption of light from ZnO NCs is very low. Another disadvantage is the low solubility of ZnO NCs in solvents which are commonly used for dissolving conjugated polymers.96 This problem of processing ZnO NCs together with polymers to obtain well-defined morphologies hindered up to now further improvement of the solar cell performance of ZnO based hybrid solar cells.
Low band gap NCs such as CdTe, PbS, and PbSe NCs are promising acceptor materials due to their ability of absorbing light at longer wavelengths which may allow an additional fraction of the incident solar spectrum to be absorbed. For instance, CdTe NCs have a smaller band gap compared to CdSe NCs, while their synthesis routes including shape control are similar to CdSe NCs.154 However, suitable CdTe/polymer systems have not yet been found, and reported PCEs based on CdTe/MEH-PPV are quite below 0.1%.82 A systematic investigation on hybrid solar cells based on MEH-PPV blended with CdSexTe1−x tetrapods demonstrated a steady PCE decrease from 1.1% starting from CdSe to 0.003% with CdTe.74 The reason of the dramatical decrease in efficiency could be attributed to the possibility that energy transfer rather than charge transfer could occur from the polymer to CdTe NCs in CdTe/polymer blends, resulting in an insufficient generation of free charge carriers.74,155 Further lowering of the NC band gap could be achieved by using semiconductors such as PbS or PbSe. Zhang et al. have reported hybrid solar cells based on blends of MEH-PPV and PbS NCs, but unfortunately the PCEs were very low (0.001%).156 Watt et al. have developed a novel surfactant-free synthetic route where PbS NCs were synthesized in situ within a MEH-PPV film.110,157 In general, using low band gap NCs as electron acceptor in polymer/NCs system has been not successful yet, because energy transfer from polymer to low band gap NCs is the most likely outcome, resulting in inefficient exciton dissociation.
Recently it has been demonstrated that Si NCs are promising for hybrid solar cells due to the abundance of Si compounds, non-toxicity, and strong UV absorption. Hybrid solar cells based on blends of Si NCs and P3HT with a PCE above 1% have been reported.117,118 Si NCs were synthesized by radio frequency plasma via dissociation of silane, and the size can be tuned between 2 and 20 nm by changing chamber pressure, precursor flow rate, and radio frequency power. Devices made out of 35 wt% Si NCs, 3–5 nm in size, exhibited a PCE of 1.15% under AM1.5G illumination which is a promising first result. The J–V characteristic is demonstrated in Fig. 15.

4. Conclusions and outlook
There has been an impressive progress achieved for OSCs during the last couple of years regarding their device performance mainly referring to their PCE values. Hybrid solar cells based on semiconducting polymers and inorganic nanoparticles are still lacking behind in PCE values by roughly a factor of 2 and more compared to the best known OSC systems based on PCBM–polymer composites. One critical aspect is the control over the nanomorphology of the donor and acceptor phases in the photoactive bulk-heterojunction films. Beside size and morphology inhomogenities, the surface constitution of semiconductor NCs is usually hard to control which leads to fluctuations in material quality, solubility and device performance. The ligand surface constitution automatically affects the solubility and ink stability of NC solutions. Up-scaling of high reproducible synthesis methods of high quality semiconductor NCs has to be implemented. In order to form optimized photoactive hybrid films a systematic evaluation of the device performance as a function of various film processing parameters such as concentrations within the composite, active layer film thickness, film annealing temperature, etc. have to be performed. Deeper understandings of the structure–function relationship within bulk-heterojunction composite layers are still lacking. New technologies such as three dimensional TEM tomography might enhance the understanding of the structure–function relationship of hybrid solar cells and enable a more direct correlation of the three dimensional film constitution with key solar cell parameters such as FF, Voc and PCE values. Additionally, interdigital nanoelectrode structures based on e.g. nanoimprint technologies might lead to a more ordered and reproducible device structure resulting in higher PCE values and improved device performances. The development and synthesis of novel low band gap semiconducting polymers will allow a more efficient energy harvesting from the solar radiation and additional band gap engineering will help to promote the usability of nanocrystal systems based on e.g. PbS, PbSe and Si NCs leading to an improved utilization of the solar energy as well. Improved surface treatments of the NCs and surface active additives might help to promote phase segregation, charge dissociation between the donor and acceptor interface and increase the charge carrier mobilities within the donor and acceptor phases leading to an increase of the photocurrent. Combining all these efforts requires a highly interdisciplinary research collaboration of chemists, physicists and engineers. Potential PCE values of 10% for OSCs as stated by Coakley and McGehee17 and Scharber et al.61 seem to be possible also for optimized hybrid solar cells which would allow to cross the threshold for commercialization, competing with already existing technologies such as DSSCs and thin film technologies. Additional factors have to be considered such as e.g. material toxicity, material costs and recovery, device long-term stabilities, achievable module efficiencies and energy payback time to directly compare different competing technologies. Nevertheless, with increased funding and research efforts in academia and in companies the probability for a sufficient device improvement for commercialization of hybrid solar cells and OSCs in general is realistic within the next couple of years.

Broader context
Hybrid organic photovoltaics based on blends of inorganic nanoparticles and conjugated polymers as photoactive layers are still lagging behind organic photovoltaics based on fullerenes and conjugated polymers in respect of device performance. Nevertheless in recent years quite some progress occurred. In principle hybrid organic photovoltaics has the potential to exceed in performance beyond the one of organic photovoltaics while having all the benefits such as low-cost, thin and flexible and easy to produce. Recent progresses and critical factors limiting the solar cell device performance are highlighted in this review article as well as strategies for further device improvement are demonstrated with recent examples from literature.
