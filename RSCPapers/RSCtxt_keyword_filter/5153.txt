    , Accepted 3rd May 2022First published on 4th May 2022AbstractGrain boundary and surface defects can be reduced by nucleation and crystallization management for designing high-quality perovskite films, which further improves the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, high-quality perovskite films are prepared by a two-step method using urea, a typical Lewis base, as an additive. The formation of a PbI2·urea complex by doping urea additive into a PbI2 precursor can slow down the crystallization of PbI2, and facilitate the formation of large grain PbI2 film. The PbI2 films with large grains have fewer nucleation sites, leading to high-quality perovskite films with large grains, excellent crystallinity, and high coverage. The increase of grain size and decrease of grain boundary density led to a decrease in defect density and charge carrier recombination, which significantly improves the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. Finally, the best performance of the PSC device is obtained for 0.2 M urea as the additive, with a PCE of 22.12%, negligible hysteresis and great stability.
Introduction
Over the years, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have found broad applications especially in the field of photovoltaics due to their low exciton binding energy, excellent ambipolar charge carrier transport properties, long carrier diffusion length, high dielectric constant and excellent film crystallinity.1–5 As a consequence of the rapid development of materials and device manufacturing, the PCE of photovoltaic cells has risen from 3.8% to 25.7% within just eleven years.6–15 In order to further push the performance and stability forward, various key factors that affect the properties of perovskite films like the deposition method, crystallization behaviour, the reactant components and additive engineering should be paid special attention.16–20 Addition of CsI to the PbI2 precursor solution has been proved to significantly enhance the morphology of the perovskite film along with the stability of the device owing to the decelerated crystallization kinetics and selective crystallographic orientation.21 Besides, cation engineering has been shown to be effective in modulating the electronic energy structure, thermal and moisture stability, and ion migration behaviors.22–25 Moreover, the strategy of doping with a Lewis base, which provides an electron donating effect, greatly modifies the optophysical properties of perovskite film.26–30
From the underlying view of the photoelectronic conversion mechanism for the optimized PCE of PSCs, the losses due to defect-related non-radiative transition are crucial in sequentially deposited perovskite films. Usually, the shallow-level states located in the perovskite grain interior are dominant while the deep-level defects are usually distributed at the grain boundaries.31–33 Hence, controlled nucleation contributes to the device performance by reducing the overall non-radiative losses in PSCs as a consequence of larger grain size along with fewer empirical grain boundaries. The normal approach to manipulate nucleation is the doping of Lewis acid and base additives where an intermediate state is formed by the reaction between the Lewis acid and base. The crystallization process of perovskite can be inhibited due to the existence of the intermediate, thereby improving the film-forming quality of the perovskite layer. Lewis bases are electron donors while basic reactants like PbI2 act as Lewis acids due to their ability to accept electrons. PbI2 is known to coordinate with three types of Lewis bases: O-donor (dimethyl sulfoxide), S-donor (thiourea) and N-donor (aniline).34–36 Urea is known to be one of the promising candidates for the formation of an intermediate phase due to its high boiling point and the ability to build weak Lewis acid–base adducts with PbI2. Moreover, it has been reported that urea, when added to the precursor solution, has the ability to retard the crystallization of perovskite.37–39 We believe that the presence of urea will have a similar effect in the sequential deposition method, which could result in increasing grain size, thereby decreasing the nucleation.
In this study, we mainly focussed on the effect of addition of urea, as a Lewis base additive, on the crystallinity and morphology of the initial PbI2 films as well as the final perovskite films. It is found that PbI2 grains are enhanced, which may be attributed to the formation of a PbI2–urea complex. The slower crystallization process helps in the growth of larger PbI2 grains. During the two-step preparation of an n–i–p PSC, urea is found to be vital in controlling the morphology and improving the quality of the final perovskite film. It is well known that the nucleation of formamidinium iodide (FAI)/methylammonium bromide (MABr)/methylammonium chloride (MACl) at the grain boundaries and defects of PbI2 films is more favourable for the two-step preparation method. Therefore, the morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite layer will be strongly dependent on the morphology of the initial PbI2 film. The larger the grain size of PbI2, the fewer the grain boundaries and defects, and consequently fewer the nucleation positions of the perovskite. In addition, the crystallization of perovskite films is delayed due to the formation of an FAI/MABr/MACl·PbI2·urea complex as an intermediate phase. These two factors are responsible for the promotion of grain growth and formation of high-quality perovskite films having large grain size and good crystallinity. Due to the reduction of defects of the perovskite film, the PCE of the PSCs is found to increase from 19.12% in the absence of urea to 22.12% in the presence of 0.2 M urea as the optimum additive.
Experimental
Materials
Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), isopropanol (IPA), acetonitrile, chlorobenzene (CB), urea, and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) are bought from Sigma-Aldrich. Lead iodide (PbI2) is directly obtained from Tokyo Chemical Industry (TCI). Tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) colloid precursor is obtained from Alfa Aesar. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates are obtained from Pilkington. Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulphonyl)imide (Li-TFSI), cobalt(III) FK209 TFSI salt (99.9%), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), methylammonium chloride (MACl), methylammonium bromide (MABr), spiro-OMeTAD, and formamidinium iodide (FAI) are produced by Xi'an Polymer Light Technology.
Fabrication of perovskite solar cells
Perovskite solar cells are prepared on FTO substrates. The FTO glasses need to be washed with deionized water, acetone, and IPA in an ultrasonicator for 30 min prior to the preparation. After cleaning and drying, the FTOs are treated with oxygen plasma for 3 min to improve the surface wetting. Before spin coating, all the solutions are filtered through a membrane filter having pore diameter of 0.22 μm. Then, a solution of SnO2 nanoparticles (Alfa Aesar SnO2 colloidal solution/deionized water = 1:4, v/v) is spin-coated on the FTO substrates at 4000 rpm for 30 s. This is followed by ambient air annealing at 150 °C for 30 min. The perovskite film is prepared inside a glove box under a nitrogen atmosphere. For perovskite film deposition, the electron transport layer of SnO2 film is spin-coated with PbI2 (692 mg of PbI2 in 1 mL of DMF and DMSO mixed solvent) solution at 1500 rpm for 30 s, which are then annealed at 65 °C for 1 min and then cooled to room temperature. A mixed solution of FAI, MACl, and MABr (270 mg, 27 mg, and 27 mg, respectively, in 3 mL IPA) is spin-coated onto the PbI2 layer at a spin rate of 2000 rpm for 30 s and then annealed inside a sealed box at 150 °C for 15 min (air humidity about 20–35%). The precursor solution of hole transporting layer (HTL) is prepared by dissolving spiro-OMeTAD in 1 mL CB. The spiro-OMeTAD solution is then doped with 28.8 μL of cobalt(III) FK209 (300 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile), 17.5 μL Li-TFSI (520 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile), and 28.8 μL TBP. Then the HTL is spin-coated on the surface of the perovskite at 4000 rpm for 30 s using the mixed spiro-OMeTAD solution. Finally, a gold electrode with a thickness of 85 nm is vapor-deposited on the surface of the HTL with a shadow mask. The effective area of the device is 0.1 cm2.
Characterization
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements are performed with a Thermo Scientific system. The surface roughness of the perovskite films is obtained from atomic force microscopy (AFM, Dimension ICON, Bruker). Surface morphologies of the PbI2 and perovskite films are investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Hitachi SU8010). The crystallinity of perovskite films is determined using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Shimadzu XRD-7000 with a 0.1541 nm Cu Kα X-ray source) at a 4° min−1 scan rate in the 2θ range of 10–60°. A Cary 50 spectrometer is used to measure the absorption spectra of the perovskite films. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy is measured using an Edinburgh FLS 980 spectrometer under a xenon lamp. An Edinburgh FLS 980 spectrometer is used to perform TRPL spectroscopy under excitation with a 475 nm laser. Space-charge limited current (SCLC) measurements are performed using a Keithley 4200 system under dark conditions. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and steady-state power outputs (SPO) of the PSCs are measured under a simulated AM 1.5G spectrum (100 mW cm−2 calibrated using a standard silicon reference cell). J–V curves of all the devices are scanned in the reverse and forward directions at a scan rate of 0.16 V s−1. Impedance spectroscopy is performed using a Zahner Zennium electrochemical workstation in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 1 Hz. The TA spectra are measured by employing a HELIOS TA system. The laser source is the Coherent Legend regenerative amplifier (150 fs, 1 kHz, 800 nm) seeded by a Coherent Vitesse oscillator (100 fs, 80 MHz). A small portion (around 10 mJ) of the laser fundamental 800 nm laser pulses is focused into a sapphire plate to produce broadband probe pulses in the visible region. In addition, the TOPAS-C optical parametric amplifier generates 650 nm pump pulses.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of the fabrication procedure used in this work both in the absence and in the presence of urea. First, PbI2 solution or the urea-containing PbI2 precursor is spin-coated on the prepared SnO2 film followed by thermal annealing for the preparation of weakly crystallized PbI2 film. Then a mixed solution of FAI/MABr/MACl is dipped on the rotating PbI2 film. After that, the film is annealed at 150 °C for 30 min in air in the presence of controlled humidity to obtain perovskite films with different grain sizes and morphologies.

The surface morphologies of PbI2 films obtained with different concentrations of urea additive as observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) are shown in Fig. S1 a–d.† It is clearly evident that with increasing urea concentration, there is a gradual increase in the grain size of PbI2. Addition of Lewis base urea to the PbI2 precursor solution can form a PbI2·urea complex, which can result in the slowing down of the crystallization of PbI2, thus forming large grain size PbI2 film. When the mixed cation FAI:MABr:MACl is deposited on the PbI2 films, the preferred nucleation point of the perovskite is at the PbI2 grain boundaries and defects. The PbI2 thin films with large grain size have fewer nucleation centers, thus favoring the formation of high-quality perovskite thin films with large grain size. In contrast, the pure PbI2 films due to smaller grain size have more nucleation sites, thus resulting in the formation of low-quality perovskite films with small grain size. Therefore, the nucleation and crystal growth process of the perovskite is regulated with the help of urea as an additive, resulting in the formation of high-quality perovskite thin films without pinholes and large grains, which can reduce the defects of perovskite film and thereby improve the efficiency and stability of PSCs. The potential efficacy of urea addition is measured by monitoring the crystal parameters via XRD. As shown in Fig. S2,† the main diffraction peak of PbI2 corresponds to the (001) surface located at 12.6°,40 and as the urea doping concentration increases from 0 to 0.3 M, the diffraction intensity of the (001) plane increases while the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) becomes sharper. The decrease of the FWHM as shown in Fig. S2† provides direct evidence for the enhancement of crystallinity of the PbI2 thin films, matching well with the results of SEM.
The formation of the PbI2·urea intermediate is further proved by studying the XPS spectrum (Fig. S3†) of a PbI2 film prepared in the presence of 0.2 M urea in the precursor solution. The presence of a small peak at 136.8 eV in the PbI2 film having urea doping which corresponds to the formation of Pb–O bonds indicates the existence of a PbI2·urea intermediate which is absent in the film with no urea doping.41
The SEM images of the perovskite films with varying concentration of urea doping are shown in Fig. 2 and an obvious increase in the grain size can be found with increasing the doping concentration of urea with the maximum grain size reaching 3.5 μm. Formation of enlarged PbI2 grains strongly facilitates the growth of larger perovskite grains and the introduction of urea can obviously promote the grain growth by controlling the nucleation and crystallization process. However, with the increase of urea concentration, some impurities were observed on the perovskite surface (Fig. 2d). This may be due to the fact that there is excess urea residue after annealing, and the accumulation of urea on the perovskite surface can lead to the recombination of carriers, which leads to the degradation of photovoltaic performance of PSCs.

As shown in Fig. 3a, XRD spectra of the perovskite films show stronger and sharper peaks with increasing urea doping (peaks at ∼14.16° and 28.45° correspond to the (001) and (002) crystal planes, respectively).42 The FWHMs of the peak corresponding to the crystal plane (001) for the perovskite films are 0.308°, 0.225°, 0.202° and 0.186° when the doping concentration of urea increases from 0 M to 0.3 M, successively, indicating that the enhancement of the crystallinity of the perovskite film is related to the presence of the additive. It is well known that the improved crystalline properties would result in the reduction of trap states in the perovskite films and thus would also suppress the unprovoked recombination of carriers, which can be detected from the photoluminescence characterization. To understand the effect of defects in the perovskite films on charge recombination, the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra and time-resolved luminescence (TRPL) of perovskite films having varying urea content are measured and are shown in Fig. 3b and c. A careful observation of the PL spectra shows a slight red shift of the PL emission peak of the perovskite film containing urea (Fig. 3b). The PL strength of the perovskite film containing urea exhibits significant enhancement compared to the film without urea, especially for the film with 0.2 M urea doping, due to the increasing grain size of the perovskite thin films caused by the addition of urea. In order to support the rationality of the PL spectrum, comparable UV-vis spectra are also recorded which are provided in Fig. S4.† In addition, from the TRPL (Fig. 3c) accurate prediction of the carrier dynamic lifetime can be obtained by fitting the data using the biexponential decay kinetics function:43,44f(t) = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2) + Kwhere τ1 and τ2 are the decay times, A1 and A2 are their pre-exponential factors, and K is a constant. τ1 is the fast decay component, representing the trap-assisted non-radiative recombination, while τ2 is the slow decay component representing the recombination of free carriers between the bands.45,46 The recombination of free carriers and defect trapping are usually responsible for the attenuation of TRPL. From the obtained values of τ1 and τ2, the average decay time (τave) is calculated using the following equation:τave = (A1τ12 + A2τ22)/(A1τ1+ A2τ2)

The fitting results are shown in Table S1.† The τave of the perovskite layer without doping of urea is 326 ns, which is shorter than that of the perovskite layer doped with 0.2 M urea (1687 ns), indicating the inhibition of defect recombination.
We conjectured that the reduction of grain boundary defects may be mainly responsible for the sharp reduction of trap-assisted recombination. In addition, we adopt transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy measurements to determine the dynamics of photoexcited states.47,48 During the TA measurements, a femtosecond pump pulse (650 nm, 1 kHz, 100 fs, 2 μJ cm−2) is used to excite the perovskite films and the photo-induced absorption changes (ΔA) are probed by using a time-delayed white light pulse. As shown in Fig. S5,† for both the films with and without urea doping, a predominant ground state bleaching centred at ∼770 nm is observed. As predicted, the decay transient obtained from the fitting using a single exponential time is 74.42 ns for the perovskite films containing 0.2 M urea, which is significantly longer than the control one (37.88 ns). These results corroborate the PL and TRPL characterization results. As the crystallinity of the perovskite film is improved and the grain size of the film becomes larger due to the addition of urea, the number of interface defects is reduced and the interface around the perovskite grain is passivated, thus resulting in less defect capture. It can further improve the open circuit voltage (VOC) of the PSCs.
Spectroscopic investigations indicate that the presence of urea as an additive mediates the trap state properties of the perovskite films; space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements provide direct evidence as shown in Fig. 3d. The trap state density (Nt) is calculated using the formula Nt = 2ε0εVTFL/eL2,49,50 where e represents the elementary charge, ε and ε0 represent the permittivity of the perovskite and vacuum, respectively, VTFL is the trap-filled limited voltage, and L is the thickness of the perovskite film. The Nt of the perovskite film without urea and with 0.2 M urea is calculated to be 3.8 × 10−15 cm−3 and 2.3 × 10−15 cm−3, respectively, thus indicating that the presence of urea as an additive can significantly reduce the trap state density of the perovskite film and further improve the VOC of PSCs.
In the preparation of a complete photovoltaic device, the contact interfaces are key factors that should be considered. Thus, further fabrication of the hole transport layer would be easier on a smooth perovskite substrate. Therefore, AFM is used to evaluate the roughness of the perovskite film and the images are shown in Fig. 4a and b. The surface root mean square (RMS) of perovskite films in the presence of 0.2 M urea as an additive (RMS = 29.2) is found to be smaller than that without urea (RMS = 39.4), indicating that the presence of urea results in a much smoother surface. Moreover, the results of AFM images are well consistent with the SEM results, as due to the mediation of urea larger grains are produced. Moreover, as the cross-sectional view shows (Fig. 4c and d), the presence of a single large grain in the device containing urea as the additive plays a positive role in charge transportation though the film thicknesses in both the devices are ∼710 nm.

The J–V curves of PSCs having different concentrations of urea doping are shown in Fig. 5a. Table S3† lists the specific parameters of the device, among which the PCE of PSCs without urea and with 0.2 M urea doping is 19.12% and 22.12%, respectively, and all the related photovoltaic parameters are also found to be significantly improved in the presence of urea. The J–V hysteresis tests are also carried out and the results are shown in Fig. S6,† with the calculated hysteresis indexes found to be 7.0% and 3.8% for the devices without and with 0.2 M urea doping,55,56 respectively, suggesting the suppression effect of urea doping. Fig. 5b shows more efficient EQE of PSCs with 0.2 M urea compared to the PSCs without urea in the whole wavelength range of 300 nm to 810 nm, and the respective integral JSC is 23.38 mA cm−2 and 24.01 mA cm−2, which is consistent with the JSC obtained from the J–V curve. The long-term stability and repeatability of the devices prepared in the presence of urea as an additive are excellent, as presented in Fig. 5c and d. The steady-state PCE of the device with 0.2 M urea can maintain 94.8% of the maximum PCE after 450 s of measurement.

As shown in Fig. 6a, lower dark currents and higher rectification ratios for the PSCs having 0.2 M urea doping in comparison to the PSCs without urea additive are the benefits obtained from the properties of improved crystallinity and suppressed trap states. The intensity-dependent VOC measurements are provided in Fig. 6b, and can be mathematically described via an equation:51–53dVOC/dln(Plight) = nkBT/qwhere kB is the Boltzmann constant, n is the ideality factor, and T and q represent the absolute temperature and elementary charge, respectively. The calculated ideality factor of the two devices in the presence of urea as additive and in the absence of urea is 1.50 and 1.89, respectively. Generally, n = 1 indicates only bimolecular charge recombination, and the smaller value of n obtained for the device with urea doping suggests suppressed trap assisted recombination, which supports the evaluation of density of states from SCLC. As shown in Fig. S7a and b,† the Fermi levels (EF) of perovskite films without and with 0.2 M urea were calculated by UPS, which were −4.77 and −4.64 eV, respectively. It is found that the Fermi level (EF) of the perovskite film added with 0.2 M urea increases because a small amount of urea exists at the grain boundary after adding urea, which can passivate the grain boundary defects and remove the trap state,54 which will promote charge transmission and thus improve the VOC of the PSCs. The band gaps (Eg) of the perovskite films without and with 0.2 M urea are estimated to be 1.552 and 1.548 eV, respectively, using Tauc plots (Fig. S7c†). Conduction band (ECB) edge values were obtained by adding the Eg to the valence band maximum (EVB). Fig. S7d† shows the energy level diagram of PSCs.

Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is an effective means for studying the recombination kinetics of PSCs. The Nyquist diagrams of the PSCs are fitted according to the equivalent circuit model (Fig. 6c), and the measured fitting parameters are displayed in Table S5.† As expected, compared to the PSC having perovskite layer without any urea doping, the series resistance (Rs) is found to be smaller and the recombination resistance (Rrec) higher for the PSC based on the perovskite layer with 0.2 M urea doping. The larger value of Rrec for the PSCs with 0.2 M urea indicates that in this device, the recombination loss is lower as there are fewer defects. Thus, addition of urea improves the crystallization of the film and reduces grain boundary defects which are responsible for the increase of Rrec. In order to further evaluate the long-term stability of the corresponding solar cells, the performance of the equipment is recorded regularly by exposing the unpackaged bare devices to a dark environment at room temperature in the presence of ∼30% humidity. Fig. 6d shows the relationship between normalized PCE and time. Compared with the control sample, the long-term stability of the device with 0.2 M urea is significantly improved. The PCE of the unsealed PSC with 0.2 M urea doping is about 70% of its initial value, while the PCE of the PSC without urea additive decreased to 51% of its original value.
Conclusions
In this work, large particles of PbI2 are obtained via addition of economical and environmentally friendly urea as an additive in the precursor solution, which promoted the complete transformation of perovskite and resulted in larger grain size of the perovskite in a two-step sequential deposition method. Eventually, the PCE is boosted from 19.12% to 22.12%. The potential efficacy of urea doping is thoroughly investigated. When urea is added into the precursor solution of PbI2, Lewis acid–base interactions result in the formation of a PbI2·urea intermediate. A highly crystalline perovskite film with a smooth surface is obtained, and the grain size exceeds 3 μm. The carrier lifetime is prolonged due to the inhibition of the trap state density of the perovskite film. The long-term stability of the photovoltaic device is enhanced, and the hysteresis effect is also significantly suppressed. The optimum concentration of urea is found to be 0.2 M for obtaining the best performance of the PSCs. This work provides an excellent means to control the crystallization process of perovskite films in the two-step process and to obtain high efficiency perovskite solar cells.
