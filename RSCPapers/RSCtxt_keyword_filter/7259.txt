1. Introduction
The development of clean alternatives to current power generation and to mechanical/electrical energy transformation technology is immensely important in order to preserve the global environment and assure sustained economic growth. Complex fluids, which may change their properties under the external electric, magnetic or optical stimulation,1,2 developed from these “future” technologies include dye-sensitized solar cells,3–5 electrorheological (ER) fluids6,7 and magnetorheological (MR) fluids.8,9 Normally, ER/MR fluids are suspensions composed of the particles dispersing into the liquid medium, and their apparent viscosity could be increased sharply within several milliseconds under the external electric/magnetic fields. This interesting phenomenon is denoted as ER/MR effect and resulted from the dielectric/magnetic polarization of the dispersed particles.10,11 Because of its swift, controllable and reversible superiority, these systems could be extensively applied in many fields.12 However, improving the mechanical/electrical energy transformation efficiency of complex fluids has been fairly difficult.13
In response to these considerable challenges, materials with predominant dielectric properties have been used as the dispersed phase of ER fluids.14–17 In recent years, particles possessing a multi-layered structure,18 rare-earth doped porous structure,19–22 micro/meso hierarchical porous structure,23,24 nanometre scale25,26 and micro/nano complex structure27,28 have been designed and synthesized for ER materials. It is found that the dielectric polarization and sedimentation stability of these particles can be largely improved from their specific structure. Zhao et al. developed the rare-earth doped titania ER materials and found the distinct enhancement in their yield stress due to defect and impurities of TiO2 doping with ions.21 Furthermore, the mesoporous rare-earth-doped TiO2 particle have been proofed to have high ER activity in which both the active internal structure and interface or surface structure merit the pursuit of suitable dielectric and conduction properties of the particles.22 Moreover, it is also found that the integrative ER performance was enhanced by the meso/micro hierarchical porous structures comparing with the single porous structures.24 Although much progress has been achieved in specific aspects within the fields,29–33 it is still a narrow neck to enhance the efficiency of mechanical/electrical energy transformation for complex fluids.
One major challenge in energy generation and conversion is to master the energy and information on the nanoscale to create materials and technologies with capabilities rivalling those of living systems. In biology, cells develop very sophisticated protein channels to transport fluid and ions across cell membranes, and the identification of the structure and function of such channels was hailed as some of the greatest scientific discoveries. Selective cation diffusion in ion channels is accomplished by structural matching of the coordinates with the cations.34–37 These results suggest that selective and effective transport can be achieved during synthesis of materials by precisely designed nanochannels through rational consideration of the interfacial interactions, channel sizes, and molecular and nanoscale structural refinement. Integration of materials and functions to achieve performance that is not possible with individual components is one of the most significant challenges in energy generation and conversion. Recently, metamaterials which contain inclusions embedded in host media38,39 with electromagnetic and acoustic characteristics, have been studied extensively and have shown promising application prospects.40–43
Inspired by biological cells consisting of nuclei and cytoplasm surrounded by a semi-permeable cell membrane and the calcium ions can function after excitation, herein, a novel kind of metamaterial particles (MMPs) with cell-like multicores/hierarchical structures have been designed and synthesized by a “one-pot” template assistant self-assembly methods focusing on enhancing the mechanical/electrical energy transformation efficiency of ER fluid. It is shown that the MMPs contain multiple rare-earth doped titania particles (about 200 nm in diameter) embedded into the amorphous carbon matrix with the size of about 8 μm. Furthermore, the carbon matrix of MMPs possesses hierarchical porous structure with average size of about 5.8 nm for mesopores and 1.8 nm for micropores. The efficiency of mechanical/electrical energy transformation for MMPs ER fluid can be largely improved near 8 times from 20.1 to 156.3 with the doping ratio of cerium (Ce) to titania particles, which benefit from the cell-like metamaterial structures. By adjusting the property of materials both treated as core and matrix, the MMPs can have extensive and exciting prospects in MR suspensions, dye-sensitized solar cells,44,45 electro- or photo- luminescent powders46,47 and so on.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of MMPs
Herein, the native edible starch was used as the carbon source, the silica sol (20 wt%, PH≈8-9) as the template, prehydrolyzed CeCl3·7H2O/TiCl4 (aq) as the precursor of doped-titania were used to synthesise MMPs. All chemical reagents used were analytical purity as reagents which were used as received without further purification.
Firstly, TiCl4 was mixed with the deionized water (H2O) at 0 °C. Then CeCl3·7H2O was dissolved into the solution to form the Ce-doped prehydrolyzed TiCl4 solution, in which the molar ratio between Ce and Ti varied from 0.02 to 0.10 (2%–10%). The silica sol solution was added into deionized water, and then H2SO4 (5 wt%) was used to adjust the PH value of this system to about 7. Secondly, the prepared CeCl3/TiCl4/H2O solution with determined Ce/Ti molar ratio was added dropwise into the silica sol and stirred for 2 h. Thirdly, the native starch was added to form an ivory-white suspension. Then the suspension was transferred into a flask with reflux at 100 °C and maintained for 4 h. After that, the semi-transparent gel was observed and preserved under 5 °C for 3 d. Finally, the frozen gel was washed using anhydrous ethanol for 2 h to dehydrate any water to obtain the white doped TiO2/SiO2/expanded starch precursor powders.
The precursor particles were then carbonized under N2 flow of 100 ml min−1 flux in a tubular furnace. The particles were firstly maintained at 100 °C and 200 °C for 1 h to stabilize the porous phase. The final calcination was then carried out at 450 °C for 3 h to produce the black as-made doped-TiO2/SiO2/porous carbon materials. The SiO2 was removed by immersing the as-made particles into a KOH solution (aq., 5 M) with ultrasonic for 12 h. Finally, the black doped-TiO2/hierarchical porous carbon MMPs were then obtained after filtration and desiccation. The MMPs were denoted as DTHPCx, where the number x presents the doped molar ratios to Ti. The undoped titania/hierarchical porous carbon materials were synthesized under the condition of Ce/Ti molar ratio was 0, and denoted as DTHPC0. As a reference, the hierarchical porous carbon particles were prepared following reference 24 and denoted as HPC.
2.2 Characterization of MMPs
The natural and structural properties of MMPs were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (D/MAX-IIIA X-ray diffraction analyzer, Rigaku, Japan) with Cu-Kα radiation, by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JSM-6460, JEOL Co. Tokyo, Japan), by laser size distribution (LSD) (Zetasizer-90 Laser size distribution analyzer, Malvern Instruments, UK) and by element dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) with Link ISIS instrument (Oxford Co., UK). The porous properties of samples were measured at 77 K using NOVA-2000e Surface area & Pore size analyzer (Quantachrome Inc. US). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method was utilized to calculate the specific surface areas (SBET) using adsorption data in a relative pressure range from 0.04 to 0.2. The pore size distributions of samples were derived from the adsorption branches of isotherms using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model for mesopores, and the Horvath-Kawazoe (HK) model for micropores. The densities (ρ) of MMPs were obtained by pycnometer. The wettability test between particles and liquid droplets was carried out using CAM-100 surface/interface contact angle recorder (Powereach Co., Shanghai, China).
2.3 Preparation and characterization of MMPs ER fluids
The obtained MMPs and HPC powders were desiccated in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h and then mixed with silicone oil (ρ = 0.993∼1.001 gcm−3, εf = 2.60∼2.80, η = 50 mPas) to form the ER fluids (Φ = 15 vol%). The fluids were heated at 120 °C to remove any residual water and fully ground for another 3 h before rheological and dielectric measurement.
The rheological features of the ER fluids were measured by Haake RheoStress-600 Rheometer (Haake Co., Germany), using PP35 ER plate-plate system at 25 °C via controlled rates (CR) model. The gap of two plates is 1.000 ± 0.001 mm and the shear rates are from 0.01 to 1000 s−1. The sedimentation stability of the ER fluids was obtained by calculating the height ratio of particles-rich parts and the total suspension after standing. The dielectric spectrum of the ER fluids were detected by the Precision LCR meter (HP 4284A, Agilent) and the frequency was ranged from 20 to 1M Hz at 25 °C. The ER fluids were put into liquid fixture (HP 16452A) and about 1 V of bias electrical potential was applied to the ER fluid.
3. Results and discussion
According to the design principles for good ER materials, including dielectric match, combination of physical and chemical modification and so on, the MMPs with multicores rare-earth doped titania/hierarchical porous carbon were synthesized by a “one-pot” template assistant self-assembly method and subsequent carbonization. A schematic diagram illustrating the overall synthesis procedure of MMPs is shown in Scheme 1.

In a typical experiment, the amorphous section of the starch granule swells and expands in boiling water, forming a semi-transparent paste. After that, the low temperature makes the paste gelate and recrystalize (retrogradation) to form new structures different from the original, and some porous structures were also obtained in this process.48 The Ce doped-titania derived from prehydrolyzed TiCl4 and SiO2 nanoparticles in silica sol were then immobilized within the expanded starch matrix (Step I). After the carbonization (Step II) and SiO2 etching, the micro/meso hierarchical porous structures were actualized in the carbon matrix (Step III). Then, the cell-like multicore doped titania/hierarchical porous carbon materials were obtained.
The SEM photograph of MMPs is shown in Fig. 1A and the particle size of DTHPC10 is about 8 μm. It is found that the TiO2 loading may be beneficial for the spherical morphology of MMPs, and the sheet morphology of HPC materials was obtained without any TiO2 loading (Fig. 1B). In a parallel experiment, the initial adjustment for pH values with H2SO4 proved to be essential and propitious to stabilize the hydrolyzation of TiCl4 and gelation formation for starch.

A broad diffraction peak at 2θ value of about 43° is observed from the XRD patterns of DTHPC10 (Fig. 2A), which corresponded to the amorphous carbon. Another weak diffraction at 2θ value of about 24° is a superposition of the 002 reflections of carbon and 101 reflections of anatase. These results clearly suggest the coexistence of amorphous carbon and nanocrystalline TiO2 in the DTHPC10, although amorphous TiO2 could not be excluded. After the template etching, the EDS of DTHPC10 particles in Fig. 2B shows the characteristic peaks of three elements within it: carbon (C), oxygen (O) and titanium (Ti). The insert shows the unique distribution of Ti element, indicating the equable distribution of doped-TiO2 particles within the MMPs. The peak for Cerium (Ce) is inconspicuous mainly due to its lower Ce-TiO2 content within the matrix. Further, the absence of peaks for silicon (Si) in MMPs also shows the successful removal of the SiO2 template.

To further confirm the state of the doped-TiO2 particles within the matrix, the precursors were annealed without N2 protection with the purpose of absolute deletion of carbon. The XRD patterns of the corresponding product shows five broad diffraction peaks, indexed as 101, 004, 200, 105 and 204 reflections of anatase phase (JCPDS File No. 89–4921), suggesting the formation of TiO2 nanocrystals after calcination at 450 °C (Fig. 2C). The LSD (insert in Fig. 2C) illustrates their average particle size is about 200 nm. The corresponding EDS shows the characteristic peaks belong to the titanium (Ti), oxygen (O) and cerium (Ce), indicating the well doped of Ce in TiO2 (Fig. 2D).
The N2adsorption-desorption curves and pore size distribution for MMPs are illustrated in Fig. 3. Table 1 summarizes the porous property and density of MMPs. It is found that the carbon matrix of DTHPC10 and DTHPC8 possess both mesoporous structures (2–50 nm) and microporous structures (< 2 nm), which indicate the existence of micro/meso hierarchical porous structures. The average size for mesopores within the DTHPC10 calculated by the BJH method (DBJH) is about 5.8 nm, and for micropores calculated by the HK method (DHK) is about 1.8 nm. This micro/meso hierarchical porous structure markedly increases the BET surface areas of MMPs which is an important factor for the ER effect.

The mesoporous and microporous structures within the carbon matrix of MMPs have the different origins. The mesoporosity is mainly derived from the cavity from the SiO2 template etching, and their pore size distribution was related to the size of SiO2 particles. Correspondingly, a great deal of microporosity originated from the porous structures formed in the expanded starch precursor, which collapsed and shrunk to transform the micropore during carbonization and dehydration, whose size was mainly affected by the heat-treated temperatures.24
As illustrated in Fig. 4A, the DTHPC10 based ER fluid shows the changes of its flow type from Newtonia to Bingham model under the electric field, which indicates its behaviour of mechanical/electrical energy transformation. Under 3 kV mm−1 DC, the dynamic yield stress (τD, defined by extrapolating the curves of shear stress as a function of the shear rates to  = 0) of this ER fluid is 500 Pa, and the ER efficiency (ηE, defined by (τE-τ0)/τ0, wherein τE is the shear stress value under electric fields and τ0 is the shear stress value under no electric field) of this ER fluid is 156.3 and 7.2 at shear rate of 0.2 s−1 and 1000 s−1, respectively (Table 2). Under the same conditions, the τD of HPC based ER fluid is 225 Pa while its ηE is 47.4 and 4.0, respectively (Fig. 4B and Table 2). It is also found that for DTHPC0 based ER fluid, the ηE is only 20.1 and 1.4 at shear rate of 0.2 s−1 and 1000 s−1, respectively. Evidently, the efficiency of mechanical/electrical energy transformation of DTHPC10 is over 7 times than that of DTHPC0 and 3 times than that of HPC.

The behaviors of mechanical/electrical energy transformation for ER fluids based on MMPs with variational doped molar ratios are shown in Fig. 5. It is also found that the τD and ηE increase with the doping ratio for MMPs, and the higher doped molar ratio may lead to the higher ηE, which have some similarity to the functions of calcium ions in the biological cells. Furthermore, for all ER fluids based on both MMPs and HPC, the values of τD agree with the dielectric polarization model and shows the exponential function to the electric field which can be expressed by τ ∝ Eα, wherein α have a little departure from 2 (Fig. 6).

Solid symbols are experimental data and the lines are the corresponding fitting curves for the experimental data. The reference line (starting at 0.8 Pa) shows the standard curve agreed with the classical dielectric polarization model in which the index α equal to 2, that is τ ∝ Eα. 
The ER fluids based on MMPs have relatively better sedimentation stability compared with that on traditional micrometre scaled TiO2 particles, which is shown in Fig. 7. Such good stability for MMPs results from the increasing effect of daggle resistance when sedimentation occurred and the decreasing effect on density for MMPs with micro/meso hierarchical porous matrix.

The improvements in the ER effect for MMPs can be understood in virtue of the proposed MMPs model, in which some doped titania particles are “embedded and distributed” into the micro/meso hierarchical porous carbon matrix, which leads to the favorable wettability and the enhanced dielectric polarizations.
A droplet of deionized water shows the approximate spherical shape on the deposited surface of DTHPC10 particles, and the contact angle (CA) is calculated to be 121.5 ± 1.5° (Fig. 8A). While, the smaller CA value (calculated to be about 20.0 ± 0.5° from Fig. 8B) for droplet of silicone oil on the deposited surface of DTHPC10 illustrates the surface of DTHPC10 is oleophilic. Such good wettability to silicone oil of MMPs can be attributed to the hierarchical porous carbon-rich surfaces with large BET specific surface areas and the hydrophobic property. Thus, the ER effect and sedimentation stability of MMPs would be improved due to their dispersive state.26

From the microscopic view, the dielectric property (expressed by ε = ε′−iε′′, where ε′ represents the dielectric constant and ε′′ represents the dielectric loss) can affect the ER behaviors largely. A good ER effect requires two important factors, including a large Δε′ (Δε′ = ε′100 Hz - ε′100 kHz) and a dielectric relaxation peak in ε′′ (expressed by σ/2πf, where σ is the conductivity and f is the frequency) within the range of 102–105 Hz.49–51 The dielectric spectra shown in Fig. 8C and Fig. 8D illustrate the ER fluids based on MMPs possess relatively large Δε′ and dielectric loss peak, which are two factors related to the interfacial polarization and enhancement of yield stress corresponding to their ER effect. Due to the doped-TiO2 loading and its hierarchical porous matrix, the ε′ of MMPs based ER fluids increases and the polarized response is enhanced. The micro/meso hierarchical porous structures within the carbon matrix could facilitate the response of polarization as different porosity has different responsive behaviours. The mesoporosity result in a large specific surface areas and optimized the polarization while the microporosity stabilized the polarization. Furthermore, the doping to TiO2 may improve the conductivity of MMPs. The presence of the large Δε′ and the dielectric loss peak resulted from the dielectric matching between the doped-TiO2 and the hierarchical porous carbon matrix leads to the enhanced interfacial/surface polarization for MMPs. Thus, the higher ER efficiency was achieved for MMPs compared with HPC particles.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, a novel kind of MMPs, in which carbon with micro/meso hierarchical porous treated as the matrix and some “embedded” rare-earth doped titania particles as the cores, were designed and synthesized by a “one-pot” template assistant self-assembly method and carbonization, aiming at enhancing the mechanical/electrical energy transformation efficiency of smart fluids. The size of the typical MMPs is about 8 μm, consisting of anatase crystal Ce-doped TiO2 particles (about 200 nm) “embedded and distributed” into the amorphous carbon matrix. The carbon matrix of the MMPs possesses micro/meso hierarchical porous structures, and the average size of mesopore and micropore are calculated to be about 5.8 nm and 1.8 nm, respectively. The efficiency of mechanical/electrical energy transformation for ER fluid based on MMPs can be largely improved to 156.3 comparing with 47.4 for HPC, and even more than 7 times improved by the doping ratio of Ce to titania particles. It is concluded that the enhanced dielectric surface/interfacial polarization of MMPs, which can be profited from the hierarchical porous carbon and doped-titania particles, play an important role in the improvement for the efficiency of mechanical/electrical energy transformation. By avoiding fabricating core-shell structure or hierarchical porous structure separately or even combining two of them on the nanometre scale, the method used here provides a easy approach to fabricate MMPs. Owing to the flexibility of the method, adjustability and functionality of the materials both treated as core and matrix, a wide variety of MMPs could find their broad applications, not only as MR fluids, but also as advanced dye-sensitized solar cells and electro- or photo-luminescent powders to largely improve the absorbing light regions and the power conversion efficiency.
