The ordered Pb–I cage in such hybrid perovskites can induce the polarized cations to form a variety of polarization domains with long-range order, which will lead to the formation of specific atomic conformations or metastable crystalline phases, unique electronic band structures and optical absorption properties. Such domain-dependent characteristics play a critical role in the phase transition and service stability of such solar cells, and also open up the opportunity of tuning their electronic structure. In the present study, we systematically investigate the band structures and optical absorption properties of different electronically ordered domains in CH3NH3PbI3. By comparing different perovskites containing various cations, we have clarified the important influence of cation polarization on domain-dependent properties. Our results provide not only a possible pathway for the manipulation of band structure by applying an external field, but also a novel scheme for improving the performance and stability of hybrid perovskites.
The hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite methylammonium lead halide (CH3NH3PbI3), which emerged from the field of dye-sensitized solar cells, was first introduced into the photovoltaics community in 2009. Following the pioneering work on nanostructured cells by Miyasaka et al.,1 nanostructured halide perovskite solar cells have experienced an unprecedented increase in their power conversion efficiencies,2 which have risen from less than 10% in 2011 to more than 20% at present and have rapidly surpassed the values of both conventional dye-sensitized and organic photovoltaic cells.3–12 The success of perovskite solar cells is attributed to their excellent semiconductor properties such as a moderate band gap, broad absorption of light across the solar spectrum, high charge carrier mobility and long electron–hole diffusion lengths.2 In particular, their ease of synthesis, tailoring of their optical absorption by chemical substitution, electron transport, and high stability in dry air make them more attractive for commercial photovoltaics applications.12–16
Modification of the composition of perovskites has been demonstrated to be an effective way of optimizing their performance, which is attributed to its effect on their structural stability and the adjustability of the band structure. In general, researchers have focused mostly on the substitution of the Pb or I atoms, e.g., in MASnI3, MAPbCl3, MAPbBr3 and their variants, whereas less study has been made of the MA moiety.17–23 Recently, it has been demonstrated by Jeon et al. that the partial substitution of the cationic group by a formamidinium moiety can achieve much better performance, which shows the important role of the organic moiety and provides an alternative pathway for developing new types of perovskite solar cells.24 An important feature of an organic group lies in its electric polarization, which results from the unequal electronegativities of its different elements. As a result, various nanoscale long-range polarization orders may form within the ordered Pb–I framework, especially under external or internal electric fields, or in conditions where the temperature is not very high.25,26 This will in turn have a major impact on the properties of the hybrid perovskite. Firstly, the formation of different polarization domains can make a perovskite possess a different electronic structure, which exerts a remarkable influence on the optical properties and efficiency of a solar cell.27 Secondly, the versatility of MA and variations in the order of domains can help in the manipulation of its optical performance by an external electric field, which provides an opportunity for its potential application in optoelectronics.28 Thirdly, the domain transformation may induce a lattice distortion, which is regarded as an origin of the collapse of a long-range ordered phase into a disordered state.29 In principle, any singly charged MA can be used if there is sufficient space available within the inorganic cage, and accordingly the variety of cations provides a wide range of options to modulate the properties of hybrid perovskites. However, in most experiments, although the average properties may be determined, it is hard to distinguish each domain region clearly because of their complexity and the localized features of domain regions cannot be specified. Therefore, although the effect of polarization domains has been recognized for a long time, further effort is still required to address many critical issues such as a qualitative correlation between a feature of a domain and its derived properties.

Ab initio computations of electronic structure provide a promising way to confirm the microscopic mechanism of the correlation between the domain-dependent characteristics and properties of perovskite. A series of theoretical studies have recently been conducted to reveal the principles behind the service performance of perovskite and/or to understand the fundamental mechanisms behind experimental observations,30–32 and some of them have paid attention to the formation of organic polarization domains in perovskite, which may form at either room or high temperature or on exposure to an internal or external electric field.10,33–35 However, owing to the complexity of domains and the variety of types of cation, a clear understanding of the mechanism of domain-dependent and polarization-dependent properties and their electronic origins is still distant, and this should be clarified by comprehensive comparisons between various polarization orders or polar cations. In particular, the optical properties of different domains, which are critical for the light absorption efficiency of perovskite and the performance of solar cells, have rarely been investigated. Therefore, a systematic study is required to investigate the effect of variations in domains in hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites, in particular when MA cationic groups with different electric polarizations act as the organic moiety. With these aims, we have performed a detailed first-principles study in the present work of various polarization domains on the nanoscale, which was performed by varying the order and direction of the arrangement of MA cations in order to study the effect on tuning the electronic structures and features of optical absorption. Furthermore, by a comparison between different alternatives to MA, we attempted to establish a pathway to improving the performance of solar cells based on perovskite, or to realize its application as an optoelectronic material via fine-tuning its domain-dependent properties.
The computations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) in the framework of density functional theory (DFT).36,37 The projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotential was adopted and the GGA exchange–correlation functional was as described by Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE).38,39 A supercell with the chemical stoichiometry of MA8Pb8I24 was adopted as the modeling system, and Fig. 1 shows the arrangements of cationic groups for three different cases of polarization domains, which are here termed ferro-polarized (FM), hybrid ferro-polarized (HFM) and antiferro-polarized (AFM) domains (illustrated in Fig. 1(a)–(c)), respectively, which served as simulation objects for modeling different long-range polarization orders. The term FM domain means that all the cations are polarized in the same direction and display ferro-polarized order. The term AFM domain means that neighboring cations are polarized in opposite directions and exhibit antiferro-polarized order. The term HFM domain means that in-plane cations are polarized in the same direction, but the polarization directions for neighboring planes are opposite, displaying hybrid ferro-polarized order. For all these kinds of domain, the cationic groups located at the center of the Pb–I framework and the orientations of the bonds that form between two functional groups are approximately parallel to the edges, face diagonals and body diagonals, respectively, which are indicated by S-, P- and B-, correspondingly. One combination of two sets of abbreviations can represent a type of domain. For example, the term S-FM indicates that the cationic groups are all polarized in ferro-polarized order along the edge directions. The nine types of polarization order that were selected represent typical long-range domains with relatively short arrangement periodicities, including parallel or antiparallel patterns, and also take into consideration the possible directions of the cations. Our simulation concentrates on the band structure and optical absorption spectrum, which are critical for determining the photoelectric properties of solar cells. Besides CH3NH3PbI3, we will also study other kinds of MAPbI3 phases by substituting MA groups with different elements and different dipoles, which provides a systematic comparison as regards the electronic structure and energetic stability.
 Fig. 1  Molecular arrangements for different polarization domains. These are: (a) ferro-polarized (FM), (b) hybrid ferro-polarized (HFM) and (c) antiferro-polarized (AFM), in order. The red and blue balls represent organic groups with high electronegativity and low electronegativity, respectively, which will lead to a shift in electron distribution from the center of the MA cation. 
Firstly, we compute various atomic conformations and electronic structures for different polarization domains of CH3NH3PbI3, which are illustrated in Fig. 2. Here, nine kinds of models of long-range domains were selected, all of which have been proved to be stable. According to the lattice constants listed in Table S1 in the ESI,† all these domains retain the features of cubic structures well. These domains possess different orders and directions of the arrangement of cations. Table 1 lists the calculated values of the band gap and the band character (direct or indirect gap) for these domains. It can be seen that as the polarization order and polarization direction change, the magnitude of the band gap can be quite different. The largest band gap, at Eg = 1.74 eV, can be induced by the B-FM domain, whereas the smallest, at Eg = 1.50 eV, can be achieved by the S-HFM domain. Therefore, the difference between them can be as large as 0.24 eV. Considering the moderately semiconducting (with a band gap in the region of 1.3–1.6 eV) nature of CH3NH3PbI3, such a domain-dependent fluctuation in energy is remarkable. For the B-FM domain, in particular, the band gap even switches from direct to indirect character, with the conduction band minimum deviating from the Γ point, which represents a fundamental change in the nature of the band structure. The band gaps for different kinds of ferro-order can be quite different, such as the S-HFM, P-AFM and B-FM domains, whereas the band gaps for the same ferro-order with different polarization directions are also distinct, such as the S-HFM, P-HFM and B-HFM domains. The energies for various domains are different, and the relative fluctuations in energy per cation are in the region of ∼0.11 eV, as shown in Table 1, which is comparable with the results of calculations in previous works.40 In addition to the band structure, we also investigated the distortion of the crystalline structure of these domains (see Table S1 in the ESI† for the detailed lattice parameters). Here, the mean square displacement (MSD) is adopted to represent this phenomenon, and this is also listed in Table 1 (see the caption for a detailed definition of the MSD). It can be seen that the magnitudes of the MSD are within the range of 0.03–0.41 Å2 and the largest lattices are observed for the B-FM and B-HFM domains.

For simulations of the band structure, the k-points we selected are along the line of R → Γ → X → M → Γ. R: (0.5, 0.5, 0.5), Γ: (0, 0, 0), X: (0.5, 0, 0), M: (0.5, 0.5, 0). 
Table 1 Gap character refers to a direct or indirect band gap. The relative energy is the difference in energy per cationic group between different domains, where the domain with the lowest energy is chosen as a reference. The MSD is used to describe the degree of lattice dislocation. The crystalline structure of the domain with the lowest energy is used as a comparison and for other domains we calculate the average square displacement of the atomic deviation, which can be expressed as . The larger is the value of MSD, the more severe is the lattice distortion

To reveal the mechanism of the domain-dependent properties, the electronic features of the edge states, namely, the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) states, which are the most important factors that determine the properties of the band structure, are analyzed. Here, we extract domains with distinct band structures and band gaps for comparison. Fig. 3 shows the three-dimensional and two-dimensional distribution of spatial charge at the VBM and CBM for the S-FM (a) and B-AFM (b) domains, respectively. It can clearly be seen that the two edge states experience different conditions as the ferro-order changes. The VBM state originates from strong hybridization between an s orbital on a Pb atom and a p orbital on an I atom, which immobilizes both orbitals pointing along the I–Pb bonding direction, and displays a weak response to the direction of orientation of the cation. The influence of the polarization pattern and polarization direction on the VBM state can mainly be attributed to two factors, both of which can change the electronic state and lead to a shift in energy. Firstly, an inhomogeneous distribution of electron density on the polar I–Pb bonds can be induced when the cations point in different directions, which is clearly seen from the fact that the I–Pb bonds along the 〈010〉 direction contribute much more to the VBM state than those along the 〈100〉 direction in the S-HFM domain, but the electron density on the I–Pb bonds is uniformly distributed within the B-AFM domain. Secondly, different arrangements of cations can distort the crystalline structure, and bending of the Pb–I framework causes changes in bonding direction and bonding strength. For the CBM, the situation is quite different. According to the analysis of orbitals, the CBM is mainly contributed by p orbitals of Pb atoms, which are surrounded by much weaker hybridization with neighboring I atoms. Therefore, the direction of p orbitals always corresponds to the direction of alignment of cations instead of the I–Pb framework, which can clearly be seen from a comparison between the CBMs of two domains. As an anti-bonding state, the p orbital is always orientated perpendicularly to the polarization direction of the cations, and such an alignment leads not only to a shift in energy but also a change in band dispersion, and even a transition between direct and indirect characters can occur when the domain varies.

Differences in band structure, especially in the bands near the Fermi level, can lead to differences in optical absorption properties, which can directly govern the performance of a solar cell. Here, we calculated the optical absorption curves across the visible wavelength region for four selected kinds of domain order and plotted them as Fig. 4(a). Generally speaking, their overall trends are similar, with the main light absorption window located in the range of 350–600 nm. This indicates that CH3NH3PbI3 possesses good visible light absorbance and is supported by experimental measurements.41 However, there still exist remarkable distinctions between different domains. For the S-FM and S-HFM domains, a broad peak is located in the region of 360–470 nm, which can probably be attributed to a smaller band gap and anisotropic interactions with cations. Such a broad absorption spectrum can guarantee their efficiency in solar cells. For the B-AFM and P-FM domains, in contrast, the peak is much narrower. This change originates from the enlarged band gap, which we have mentioned above. It is obvious that the domain-induced variation in electronic structure and the shift in the absorption peak can change the intensity of light absorption. For the B-AFM and P-FM domains, the absorption intensities are 20–40% lower than those of S-FM and S-HFM in the range of 450–600 nm, which indicates a significant loss of energy utilization. Therefore, domains with different orders and different polarization directions can produce quite distinct optical properties.
 Fig. 4  Optical absorption curves of (a) CH3NH3PbI3, (b) CF3NH3PbI3 and (c) CH3SH2PbI3. For each kind of material, four kinds of domain with distinct band structures are selected. 
Based on the computations for CH3NH3PbI3, we extended our study to other kinds of perovskite material containing MA groups with distinctive polar features. The materials we selected for detailed computations are CF3NH3PbI3 and CH3SH2PbI3, respectively. The former was suggested in a previous work,28 and the introduction of fluorine can increase the polarization of the organic group in comparison with that of CH3NH3+. According to our calculations, the molecular dipole moment for the CF3NH2 molecule is 2.60 Debye, which is larger than that induced by the CH3NH2 molecule, which is calculated to be 1.41 Debye, and this can be viewed as a good model material for simulating strong polarity. For the latter compound, we chose the –SH2– group based on considerations of the comparison of valence between S and N, and its coordination can also guarantee the +1 ionic charge of the cation and the semiconducting nature of this perovskite. Owing to the similar electronegativities of carbon and sulfur, the dipole of the CH3SH molecule is very small and is calculated to be 0.65 Debye, and therefore this compound can be regarded as representative of a weakly polar hybrid perovskite. We computed the band gap values, band gap characters, and relative distortions of the crystalline structure for different molecular alignment orders for both kinds of material and have listed these parameters in Table 1, as we have done for CH3NH3PbI3. Moreover, we also present their detailed band structures as Fig. S2 and S3 in the ESI.† For CF3NH3PbI3, great distinctions exist between phases with different polarization orders. The magnitude of the disparity in the band gap between these domains is ∼0.44 eV, which is larger than that in the case of CH3NH3PbI3. In particular, there are a number of phases that exhibit indirect band gaps, which indicates that the phase transition from a direct to an indirect gap has more chance of occurring. The fluctuations in energy as the domain changes are more intense, and the relative energy per cation can be as large as 0.13 eV. Furthermore, the deformation in the crystalline lattice that is induced is also more remarkable, and the largest MSD values can reach 0.51 Å2, which indicates much more severe distortion compared with CH3NH3PbI3. For CH3SH2PbI3, however, the band gaps of different domains are more or less the same at around 1.60 eV, with a slight fluctuation of ∼0.04 eV, and it maintains its direct gap nature no matter what the arrangement of MA cations is. Moreover, the variations in energy and lattice distortion are also much smaller (the relative energy per cation is no greater than 0.06 eV, whereas the MSD value is no greater than 0.16 Å2). Therefore, the properties of CH3SH2PbI3 are insensitive to changes in domain from the aspects of both band structure and crystalline structure. Simulations of extreme cases for both extraordinarily strongly polar and weakly polar MA cations confirmed again the effect of electric domains on the electronic structure and crystalline structure.
Different intensities of polarization can result in fundamental differences in optical spectra. Fig. 4(b) and (c) show the calculated absorption spectra for four selected domains of two kinds of material, respectively. For CF3NH3PbI3, a drastic change in band structure can induce a strongly anisotropic response in optical absorption. For the spectra of the S-AFM and S-HFM domains, the absorption peak exhibits a red shift of as large as 100 nm, from 300 to 400 nm. In particular, such a shift can lead to a complete removal of optical absorption from the visible-light region. Therefore, a transformation among domains can fundamentally change the optoelectronic features of strongly polar hybrid perovskites, which can even be viewed as a switch for turning on/off visible-light absorption. For CH3SH2PbI3, in contrast, the optical absorption displays isotropic character, where the absorption peak appears almost at the same wavelength (∼400 nm) and the absorption intensities are similar in the entire visible region, which means that such weakly polar materials can exhibit steady optical performance, regardless of the versatility of MA. Furthermore, the absorption spectra of CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3SH2PbI3 display comparable features, in particular around ∼400 nm, which is probably due to their similar band gaps and band structures around the Fermi level.
According to previous studies, domains with long-range order can be built up when the temperature is not high (commonly believed to be lower than ∼160 K for CH3NH3PbI3),28,40 under which conditions the free rotation of molecules can be effectively suppressed. The probability can be higher when there exists an internal/external field, or when the hybrid perovskite is of nanoscale size. Furthermore, when a cation with a large radius is employed, such as CF3NH3PbI3, rotation of the cation could be much more difficult and an ordered phase is easier to form and can exist stably.25 This can clearly be seen from the high activation barrier between domains (see Fig. S4 in the ESI†). Therefore, domains can be expected in such hybrid structures, especially those with relatively low energies such as the P-AFM, B-FM or B-AFM domains for CH3NH3PbI3 and P-HFM or B-AFM domains for CF3NH3PbI3. The formation of domains can bring both advantages and disadvantages at the same time. On the negative side, owing to the tunable band structure induced by domains, the optical properties may be easily altered by an external or internal field, which is harmful for the stable operation of solar cells. Furthermore, ferroelectric order can cause structural distortion, which leads to the breakdown of long-range order and even phase transition.42 Therefore, perovskites with a weakly polar MA, e.g., CH3SH2PbI3, appear to be good candidates for applications in solar cells. On the positive side, the adjustability induced by a polar MA provides a good pathway for realizing optical manipulation in hybrid perovskite materials. For this purpose, perovskites with a strongly polar MA, e.g., CF3NH3PbI3, can be used. Because there are a variety of MA groups to choose from, there exists a very large range of options to tune the properties according to the demands of the application, and the optical properties of MAPbI3 perovskites can be tailored by choosing a suitable type of organic cation.
Finally, we would like to extend the study to more kinds of MAPbI3 with a variety of MA cations and, in addition, pay special attention to the discussion of the stability of such hybrid perovskites with different MA cations from the aspects of both energy and structure. As well as the three types investigated above, nine other kinds of MA cation were also employed in this study, as listed in Table 2, while their atomic structures are illustrated in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† Geometry optimizations were employed to test whether a specific MA cation can form a stable perovskite structure. For stable phases, the formation enthalpy was used, which is calculated by ΔH = E(MAPbI3) − E(MAI) − E(PbI2) (the formation energy per MA group). A smaller value of ΔH means that a much greater gain in energy is generated during the chemical reaction and thus the resulting perovskite is thermodynamically more stable. It can be seen that the hybrid structures with the MA cations CF3NH3+, CH3SH2+, CFH2NH3+, CF3SH2+, NH3OH+, NH3SH+, CH3BH3+ and CH3PH3+ are stable with relatively standardized perovskite structures, which means that they are available from the aspect of energy and have a high probability of being realized in experiments, and can be viewed as good candidates for hybrid perovskites with different kinds of cation. However, the perovskites with the MA cations CF2HNH3+, CH2ClNH3+, CHCl2NH3+ and CH3NF3+ are not stable because geometry optimization will lead to a large deviation from the perovskite structure. For these cases of failure, there always exists an organic group or element with a large radius such as CF2H+, CH2Cl+ and NF3+, and the cage formed by the Pb–I framework does not have enough space to contain it. This is also the reason why structural instability is observed in experiments when the organic group is formamidinium.27 In particular, symmetry may also play an important role in the generation of a hybrid perovskite phase, which has been suggested from the fact that cations with CF3+ groups (such as CF3CH3+ or CF3SH2+) can be stable but that those with CF2H+ groups (such as CF2HCH3+) cannot, although the radius of CF3+ is larger than that of CF2H+. For the successful cases, different MA cations can lead to different ΔH values when forming a perovskite phase. The absolute values of ΔH for CH3SH2PbI3, NH3OHPbI3, and NH3SHPbI3 are all larger than that of CH3NH3PbI3, which means that they are more stable in comparison with this commonly used material from the aspect of energy and may be suitable for usage in solar cells with high stability. In contrast, the ΔH values for other phases are low, which may also be due to the large radius of the functional groups. These MAPbI3 perovskites exhibit band gaps ranging from 1.60 to 2.00 eV, and all of them can be viewed as moderately semiconducting.

In conclusion, we have presented a detailed study of several kinds of hybrid halide perovskites to emphasize the effect induced by polarization domains of organic cations. The band structure of perovskites can exhibit quite different features for a variety of perovskites that consist of different polarization domains, including the band gap and its direct character, and distinct optical properties can be induced, which are determined by the magnitude of the electric polarization of the organic cation. In the case of a strongly polar organic cation, the optical absorption spectrum varies drastically as the domain changes and simultaneously the lattice structure experiences a large distortion. In contrast, the band structures and optical properties of weakly polar cations are almost independent of polarization domains, and the generation of ferro-order has little effect on the lattice structure. Our study reveals that the type of organic group has a critical influence on the electronic structure, optical properties and stability of halide perovskites. In view of these facts, we propose that the modulation of domains may provide an effective pathway for optimizing the performance of these kinds of solar cell and that moreover it is possible to achieve optoelectronic manipulation by applying an external field.
