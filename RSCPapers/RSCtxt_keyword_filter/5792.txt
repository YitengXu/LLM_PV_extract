    , Accepted 18th January 2020First published on 20th January 2020AbstractAn asymmetric heptacyclic electron-donating core, namely DTPPSe, was developed by integrating selenophene and dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) building blocks. Three DTPPSe-based narrow band gap asymmetric fused-ring acceptors (FRAs) (ca.DTPPSe-IC, DTPPSe-2F and DTPPSe-4F) have been synthesized to specifically explore the effect of fluorinated end groups on their photovoltaic performance. The two fluorinated FRAs (ca.DTPPSe-2F and DTPPSe-4F) exhibit red-shifted absorption and significantly deeper energy levels relative to non-fluorinated DTPPSe-IC. When blending with a PBDB-T donor, the DTPPSe-2F blend films show a better miscibility with fibrous and uniformly ordered phase separation morphology compared with the other two counterparts. As a result, a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.76% was achieved for DTPPSe-2F based organic solar cells (OSCs) with a low energy loss (Eloss) of 0.60 eV. To the best of our knowledge, this PCE is among the highest values for OSCs in the literature using selenophene-containing FRAs. Our results not only indicate the great potential of the asymmetric heptacyclic donating core DTPPSe for developing efficient FRAs, but also demonstrate the fluorination of the end groups of FRAs as key to modulate the energy levels in molecular engineering.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have been considered to be promising as the next generation of green energy technology due to their characteristics such as light weight, extensive absorption and large-area processing.1–5 Over the past decades, new donor polymer development has been the principal pathway to achieve efficient OSCs, while the exploration of electron acceptors has lagged behind. Fullerene derivatives (e.g., PC61BM, PC71BM, ICBA, etc.)6,7 have been widely explored as electron acceptors due to their high electron mobility (μe) and isotropic charge transporting properties.8 However, several inherent defects including weak optical absorption and limited energy level variability impede their further application in OSCs,9 which drives us to further develop novel acceptors to address these problems. The star molecule ITIC adopting an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structure has thus opened a new era of fused-ring acceptors (FRAs) to pursue pioneering OSCs.10 Benefiting from prodigious endeavours of FRAs and device engineering in recent years, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 17% have been achieved for both single-junction and tandem OSCs.11–13
Expanding the light absorption range of FRAs is one of the most direct strategies to improve the short-circuit current (JSC) of their related OSCs. It is noted that many FRAs featuring a narrow optical band gap (Eoptg < 1.45 eV) contribute significantly for high-performance OSCs due to their high JSCs.14–17 For instance, by expanding the D blocks, Zhan et al.18 developed F6IC, F8IC and F10IC to achieve stronger light absorption, resulting in a maximum JSC of 25.12 mA cm−2 in OSCs. However, this high JSC was obtained at the expense of open-circuit voltage (VOC), i.e., the best PTB7-Th:F8IC devices only obtained a moderate PCE of 10.9%, where a quite low VOC of 0.64 V was observed with a high voltage loss (Vloss) of 0.63 eV. Such status quo highlights that the simultaneous improvement of JSC and VOC is the key to achieve high PCEs. In general, utilizing a more electron-rich D core is the most effective avenue to narrow Eoptg for up to near-infrared (NIR) absorption. Extending the conjugated length and introducing heteroatom groups are two typical methods for building a strong electron-donating core.18–21 However, such FRAs are detrimental to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy offset between donor and acceptor, which imposes restriction on the option of polymer donors. Besides, matching with a suitable donor will inevitably affect the VOC of the device. To address the trade-off between JSC and VOC, it is necessary to design efficient narrow band gap FRAs adopting appropriate electron-rich central cores.
In most cases, thiophene is proverbially used as a modular D unit while selenophene is relatively unpopular. As a chalcogen element, selenium has a large atomic radius and great polarization, which endows selenophene with the capability to induce intermolecular Se–Se (chalcogen interaction) or selenium–aromatic interactions among selenophene-derived FRAs.22–24 In addition, stronger electron-donating ability and reduced aromaticity of selenophene relative to thiophene increase the quinoidal character.25 As a result, selenophene-based FRAs present improved planarity, increased effective conjugation length, and narrower Eoptg values compared to thiophene-based counterparts.26–29 Hou and co-workers30 reported an indacenodiselenopheno[3,2-b]thiophene cored FRA (SeTIC-4Cl) with an Eoptg of 1.44 eV. When blending with a PM6 donor, the OSCs exhibited an impressive PCE of 13.32%. Also, the devices’ PCEs were insensitive to the variation of blend film thickness up to 300 nm. Very recently, Peng and co-worker developed a novel FRA named TSeTIC by adopting an indacenodithiophene[3,2-b]selenophene core.26 Compared to its thieno[3,2-b]thiophene counterpart (Eoptg = 1.58 eV), TSeTIC showed red-shifted absorption and thus narrower Eoptg (1.53 eV). The PM6:TSeTIC based OSCs delivered an outstanding PCE of 13.71% with simultaneously increased electron and hole mobilities. It is obvious that fusing selenophene into a central donating core to design asymmetric FRAs has great potential for obtaining efficient OSCs.
Recently, our group has successfully explored dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) fused-ring cored symmetric (ca. INPIC-4F,31 IPIC-4CI32) and asymmetric FRAs like IPT-2F33 for high-efficiency OSCs. DTP stands out for its sp2-hybridized nitrogen, whose lone pair electrons in the vertical p-orbital can delocalize along the π-orbitals of the molecule. Extending the delocalized π-electron system can thus not only narrow the Eoptg but also strengthen the intermolecular π–π stacking among the resultant molecules.34–36 Consequently, the three FRAs mentioned above exhibit narrow Eoptgs (ca. 1.32–1.44 eV), rendering satisfactory PCEs over 13% for OSCs based on their blends with polymer donors. More inspiringly, all OSCs have shown quite low Vloss (0.51–0.54 eV).31–33 Our results demonstrate DTP as a promising electron-rich block in exploiting efficient narrow band gap FRAs. In particular, compared to symmetric counterparts, asymmetric FRAs boast higher binding energy and more compact π–π stacking (induced by larger dipole moment), facilitating better intramolecular charge transfer (ICT).37–39 Taking all these into consideration, we are keen to flank selenophene into a DTP fused donating core to explore narrow band gap asymmetric FRAs for efficient OSCs.
In this work, a novel electron-rich D core named DTPPSe was developed by fusing a central benzene ring with selenophene and DTP units on two sides via a cyclopentadiene bridge. In addition, in order to systematically study the effect of fluorinated end groups of selenophene-fused FRAs on their photovoltaic performance, we synthesized three novel acceptors (DTPPSe-IC, DTPPSe-2F, or DTPPSe-4F) (Fig. 1b), end-capped with a corresponding electron-deficient terminal unit of 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC), mono-fluorinated IC or and di-fluorinated IC, respectively. As the substituted fluorine atom increases, the three FRAs exhibit gradually narrowed Eoptg and significantly red-shifted absorption, which can promote the ICT effect to achieve a better device performance empirically. Surprisingly, when blended with a wide band gap donor polymer PBDB-T40 (Fig. 1a), DTPPSe-2F based OSCs contribute an optimal PCE of 13.76% with a VOC of 0.84 V, a JSC of 22.16 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 73.70% and a low Eloss of 0.60 eV. As a contrast, DTPPSe-IC and DTPPSe-4F based devices achieved a much lower PCE of 9.88% and 12.03%, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 13.76% is among the highest values so far reported in the literature for OSCs adopting selenophene-fused FRAs (Table S1, ESI†).

Results and discussion
The synthetic route to three selenophene-fused asymmetric FRAs is depicted in Scheme 1, and the detailed experimental procedures are outlined in the ESI.† As shown, the flanking of selenophene and DTP on two sides of a benzene ring is realized via a Stille coupling reaction between tributyl-(selenophen-2-yl)stannane and compound 133 using Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst to afford compound 2. Bimolecular nucleophilic addition between diester 2 and 4-hexylphenyllithium occurred, which was then followed by Friedel–Crafts intramolecular cyclization to form the asymmetric heptacyclic core, i.e., DTPPSe. Compound 3 was prepared by performing the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction on DTPPSe with POCl3 in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). Subsequently, the Knoevenagel condensation reaction between compound 3 and three IC-based end groups afforded DTPPSe-IC, DTPPSe-2F and DTPPSe-4F in 70%, 61% and 65% yield, respectively. The structural characterization data including 1H NMR, 13C NMR and mass spectra can be found in Fig. S1–S15 (ESI†). All three FRAs exhibit good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform and chlorobenzene at room temperature. The thermal properties of three FRAs were measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), with the TGA traces shown in Fig. S16 (ESI†). The results indicate that all the acceptors have good thermal stability with the decomposition temperature (5% weight-loss, Td) of 338 °C observed for DTPPSe-IC, 333 °C for DTPPSe-2F and 340 °C for DTPPSe-4F, respectively.

The normalized ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of DTPPSe-based FRAs were investigated both in chloroform (CF) solutions (Fig. S17, ESI†) and thin films (Fig. 1c). All FRAs in CF solutions exhibit strong absorption in the range of 620–800 nm, with a maximum absorption peaking at 742, 748 and 751 nm for DTPPSe-IC, DTPPSe-2F and DTPPSe-4F, respectively. In the state of a solid film, a broader absorption range is observed compared to that in solution. Besides, both the maximum absorption peaks and the absorption edges are red-shifted relative to their solutions, which is due to more significant intermolecular π–π stacking in the solid state.41,42 Compared with DTPPSe-IC (Eoptg = 1.46 eV), fluorinated DTPPSe-2F and DTPPSe-4F have a red-shifted absorption edge of 35 nm and 46 nm, leading to a narrower Eoptg of 1.40 eV and 1.39 eV, respectively. The detailed optical data are summarized in Table 1. All three FRA films show complementary absorption with the-state-of-the-art PBDB-T (Fig. 1c), which guarantees the capture of photons to promote high JSC values in the corresponding OSCs.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was then used to measure the frontier orbital energy levels of three FRAs in thin film. The onset oxidation potential of the ferrocene external standard was determined to be 0.34 V relative to Ag/AgCl (Fig. S18a, ESI†). According to the oxidation and reduction onsets (derived from the curves in Fig. S18b, ESI†), the LUMO/HOMO levels of DTPPSe-IC, DTPPSe-2F and DTPPSe-4F are calculated to be −3.84/−5.38 eV, −4.05/−5.52 eV and −4.10/−5.53 eV, respectively. The corresponding electrochemical data are summarized in Table 1. Compared with DTPPSe-IC, the down-shifted LUMO levels of DTPPSe-2F and DTPPSe-4F can be attributed to the fact that the fluorinated ICs have stronger electron-withdrawing ability than the non-fluorinated one. As the LUMO/HOMO levels of the polymer donor PBDB-T locate at −3.18/−5.23 eV, there is enough driving force for exciton separation between the donor and the FRAs. In order to more intuitively reflect the energy levels of these materials, the energy level diagrams of PBDB-T, DTPPSe-IC, DTPPSe-2F and DTPPSe-4F are shown in Fig. 1d.
To further explore the influence of fluorinated end groups on the electron density distribution of the three FRAs, density functional theory (DFT) calculations using Gaussian at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level were performed, where we simplified the alkyl chain to ethyl for the conjugated skeleton and methyl for the non-conjugated structure. As shown in Fig. S19 (ESI†), all the FRAs exhibit a high degree of planarity. The LUMOs are delocalized throughout the backbone to facilitate efficient electron transport, while the HOMOs are primarily located on the central donating core.38 The LUMO/HOMO energy levels are calculated to be −3.26/−5.29 eV for DTPPSe-IC, −3.32/−5.36 eV for DTPPSe-2F, and −3.42/−5.42 eV for DTPPSe-4F. The significantly deeper energy levels of DTPPSe-2F and DTPPSe-4F than those of the non-fluorinated counterpart can be attributed to the electron-deficient properties of the fluorinated end groups. The DFT quantum chemistry calculation results are in accordance with the CV measurements. To further visualize the electron density distribution in the three FRAs, the electrostatic potential (ESP) analysis of their simplified models on van der Waals surfaces (electron density isosurfaces at 0.001 a.u.)43 was performed from DFT calculations. As presented in Fig. 1e, the most part of their surface has positive ESP while negative regions are only localized at their end groups, which is favorable for exciton dissociation, facilitating the electron transfer from the donor to acceptors.44
In order to evaluate the photoelectric properties of the three FRAs, we fabricated the OSCs with an inverted device structure of ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T:FRAs/MoO3/Ag using PBDB-T as the donor. The donor PBDB-T has an absorption complementary to the acceptors and mutually matched energy levels to facilitate exciton dissociation. The PBDB-T and FRAs were miscible in chlorobenzene, and the active layers were prepared by solution spin-coating. Also, various considerations such as donor/acceptor (D/A) weight ratios, additives and thermal annealing were used for device optimization. The characteristic device data reflecting the optimization process and J–V curves are provided in Tables S2–S4 (ESI†) and Fig. S20–S22 (ESI†). The optimized PBDB-T:DTPPSe-IC devices exhibit a moderate PCE of 9.88% with a VOC of 0.90 V, a JSC of 17.32 mA cm−2, and an FF of 63.36%. The high VOC is ascribed to the large energy difference between the LUMO of the DTPPSe-IC and the HOMO of PBDB-T. With the introduction of mono-fluorinated end groups, a significantly increased JSC of 22.16 mA cm−2 was obtained by PBDB-T:DTPPSe-2F devices due to the red-shifted absorption and efficient charge transport. As a result, the DTPPSe-2F based devices delivered an impressive PCE of 13.76% with a slightly reduced VOC of 0.84 V and an FF of 73.70%. Compared with DTPPSe-2F, DTPPSe-4F has a narrower Eoptg. However, the PBDB-T:DTPPSe-4F devices showed a slightly inferior PCE of 12.03% with an FF of 72.84%, a reasonably lower VOC of 0.78 V but an unexpectedly low JSC of 21.18 mA cm−2, which may be mainly attributed to poor active layer morphology. The optimized photovoltaic parameters of the three FRA-based devices are summarized in Table 2, and their corresponding J–V curves are depicted in Fig. 2a. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 13.76% obtained by the PBDB-T:DTPPSe-2F devices is among the highest value reported in the literature so far among selenophene-containing FRA-based OSCs (Table S1, ESI†).

The corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the optimized devices are presented in Fig. 2b. Obviously, all three FRA-based devices yield a broad photon response in the wavelength region from 300 to 850 nm with the EQE values exceeding 50% at most wavelengths, suggesting that the polymer donor and DTPPSe-based FRAs concurrently make a contribution to the photocurrent. The highest EQE values of PBDB-T:DTPPSe-2F and PBDB-T:DTPPSe-4F based devices both reached over 75%, which are much higher than those of PBDB-T:DTPPSe-IC based devices. The broader spectral response and higher maximum EQE values exhibited by these two fluorinated FRA-based devices illustrate that the introduction of fluorinated end groups is beneficial for the photoelectric conversion process, which explains their higher JSC compared with DTPPSe-IC based devices. The calculated JSC integrated from the EQE curves is 17.21, 21.14, and 20.39 mA cm−2 for DTPPSe-IC-, DTPPSe-2F- and DTPPSe-4F-based devices, respectively, which are consistent with the corresponding JSC values measured from their J–V curves (within 5% mismatch).
To check the photoinduced exciton dissociation and charge-transfer behaviours of the three DTPPSe-based FRAs in the blend films, photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiments were performed on their pure films and blend films with PBDB-T. As depicted in Fig. 2c, all three FRAs exhibit PL emission bands at 750–930 nm when excited at an excitation wavelength of 660 nm. The PL emissions of DTPPSe-2F and DTPPSe-4F are almost completely quenched by PBDB-T, indicating efficient hole transport from these two FRAs to PBDB-T. However, the DTPPSe-IC is less quenched by PBDB-T in comparison to the above two PBDB-T:FRA blends. Regarding the electron transfer, the PL emission band of PBDB-T is located in the range of 630–850 nm when excited at 550 nm (Fig. 2d). The strong emission of PBDB-T is almost completely quenched by both DTPPSe-2F and DTPPSe-4F, suggesting efficient charge transport from PBDB-T to DTPPSe-2F and DTPPSe-4F. However, the PL emission of PBDB-T is less quenched in the devices of PBDB-T:DTPPSe-IC, which can be partly attributed to its different blend film morphology. These results indicate that the introduction of fluorine atoms on the terminal groups has a huge impact on exciton dissociation and charge transport efficiencies.45
The effect of fluorinated end groups on charge transport behaviour in blend films was further investigated using the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method. The electron-only device structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/PDINO/Al was used for μe measurement, while the hole-only device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag was used for μh (shown in Fig. S23 and Table S5 in the ESI†). The μe/μh of PBDB-T:DTPPSe-IC, PBDB-T:DTPPSe-2F and PBDB-T:DTPPSe-4F based devices was measured to be 4.53 × 10−4/2.48 × 10−4, 5.12 × 10−4/4.74 × 10−4 and 4.96 × 10−4/4.23 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, corresponding to a μe/μh ratio of 1.82, 1.08, and 1.17, respectively. The results demonstrate that the fluorinated end groups can simultaneously improve the μe and μh. It is worth noting that, compared with the blend films based on DTPPSe-IC and DTPPSe-4F, the DTPPSe-2F based devices exhibit higher μe and μh and a more balanced μe/μh ratio, indicating a reduction in carrier recombination for higher JSC and FF.38,46
We also performed dark current testing on the optimized devices to evaluate the device fabrication process and understand the charge recombination. The corresponding test circuit diagram is plotted in Fig. S24 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 3a, region I accounts for leakage (shunt) currents, region II stands for recombination currents, and region III represents series resistance. The device based on PBDB-T:DTPPSe-2F shows the lower leakage current, illustrating that the shunt resistant of the device is higher than that of the other two devices, thus contributing to the higher FF from J–V measurements. Meanwhile, the series resistance (RS) of devices based on different acceptors DTPPSe-IC, DTPPSe-2F and DTPPSe-4F is 18.8, 7.6, and 8.8 Ω, respectively. And shunt resistance (RSh) is 12.8, 44.9 and 21.2 kΩ in sequence. The lowest RS and the highest RSh of the PBDB-T:DTPPSe-2F device affirm that the device has the best electron selectivity and slightest charge recombination loss.47

To study the exciton dissociation and charge collection properties, the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) of the OSCs was measured. As shown in Fig. 3b, the value of Jph increases with the increment of Veff, and finally reaches the saturation current (Jsat) at high Veff (>2 V), indicating that all the photogenerated excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers and collected by the electrodes.27,48,49 The value of Jph/Jsat is used to estimate the exciton dissociation probabilities (Pdiss), and the corresponding values are calculated to be 94.9%, 98.8% and 95.1%, respectively, for the optimized PBDB-T/DTPPSe-IC, PBDB-T/DTPPSe-2F, and PBDB-T/DTPPSe-4F blend films under short circuit conditions. The results demonstrate that the DTPPSe-2F based devices achieved the most efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiency relative to the other two devices, which is highly desirable to obtain high FF.
The light-intensity (P) dependence of JSC and VOC were examined to understand the bimolecular and trap-assisted recombination behavior in these three devices. The correlation between light intensity and JSC follows the relation, JSC ∝ Pα, where the exponential factor α represents the extent of the bimolecular recombination.50,51 As presented in Fig. 3c, the α values of the PBDB-T:DTPPSe-IC, PBDB-T:DTPPSe-2F and PBDB-T:DTPPSe-4F devices are all very close to 1, indicating that only minor bimolecular recombination occurred in these three devices. The results from the plot of the light intensity versus VOC (Fig. 3d) show significant correlation with the fluorinated end groups. The devices based on PBDB-T:DTPPSe-IC exhibit a slope of 1.36 kT/q while the other two devices have smaller slopes of 1.05 kT/q for PBDB-T:DTPPSe-2F and 1.10 kT/q for PBDB-T:DTPPSe-4F devices, indicating that the introduction of fluorine atoms on the end groups tends to have less trap-assisted recombination in the active layer.52 Among all three devices, the PBDB-T:DTPPSe-2F based device featured the smallest slope, suggesting that there is minimal trap-assisted recombination in its blend film, which is conducive to obtaining higher JSC and FF.
It is well known that the morphology of the blend films is closely related to device performance. Therefore, in order to investigate the effect of blend film morphology based on different end group-based FRAs on device performance, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed. As depicted in AFM height images (Fig. 4a–c), all three FRA-based blend films exhibit a smooth and uniform surface with relatively small root-mean-square surface roughness (Rq) of 2–3 nm. However, the difference of the three blend films can be observed from the AFM phase images (Fig. 4d–f). Compared with the large domain size in PBDB-T:DTPPSe-IC blend film, the PBDB-T:DTPPSe-2F blend exhibits a fibrous and ordered phase separation and the PBDB-T:DTPPSe-4F blend shows slightly rougher phase separation morphology than the PBDB-T:DTPPSe-2F blend. According to the TEM images in Fig. 4g–i, the PBDB-T:DTPPSe-2F blend film displays a more homogeneous morphology with the clearly visible nanofibrous phase zone relative to the other two blends, indicating the construction of a well-developed interpenetrated charge transfer network.53 The results suggest that the excellent phase separation morphology due to good miscibility of DTPPSe-2F and PBDB-T facilitates charge transport and dissociation, which strongly explains the highest JSC and FF obtained by PBDB-T:DTPPSe-2F based devices.

In order to investigate the miscibility between donor and DTPPSe-based FRAs in the three blends, we measured the contact angle for all four pristine materials and their corresponding blend films. As presented in Fig. 5, the water contact angle (WCA) is determined to be 103.8°, 95.7°, 96.6° and 99.5° for PBDB-T, DTPPSe-IC, DTPPSe-2F and DTPPSe-4F, respectively. The surface tensions (γ) are further calculated from the contact angle data in water and glycerol by Wu models,54,55 and the corresponding data are listed in Table 3. The results indicated that the film of PBDB-T shows lower surface tension than the other three DTPPSe-based FRAs. The same trend was observed for glycerol contact angles. Among the three blend films, the WCA value of PBDB-T:DTPPSe-2F is determined to be 104.7°, which is close to that of the pure film of PBDB-T (103.8°). The results indicate that more PBDB-T gathers on the blend film superficially, suggesting different vertical phase separations relative to the two other blends.56 Then the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χ) (defined by χ ∝ (γdonor1/2 − γacceptor1/2)2)57,58 was used to further compare the miscibility of the three blends. As far as the binary systems are concerned, poor miscibility causes inordinate self-aggregation to lower device performance, while too good miscibility leads to excessive impure phase domains and thus more bimolecular recombination.53,59 Therefore, a suitable miscibility is vital in the eventual photovoltaic performance. The χ parameter of PBDB-T:DTPPSe-IC, PBDB-T:DTPPSe-2F and PBDB-T:DTPPSe-4F blends is calculated as 1.92, 1.36 and 1.00, respectively. The χ value of PBDB-T:DTPPSe-2F blends achieved is between those of the other two devices, which may indicate that suitable miscibility and excellent phase separation morphology can be obtained for efficient charge transport and high FF.54,60 The results are in accordance with the WCA values, AFM and TEM images of the three blends.

We all know that energy loss (Eloss), defined by Eloss = Eoptg − qVOC, is an important parameter in evaluating device performance in OSCs (the Eoptg is calculated based on the absorption onset of the blend films).61 Typically, the Eloss in organic photovoltaics is around 0.6 eV or higher, while the Eloss in perovskite solar cells is generally between 0.4 and 0.55 eV.62 Before us, Peng et al. and Hou et al.26,30 independently developed selenophene-containing FRAs named TSeTIC and SeTIC4Cl, respectively, and over 13% PCEs were achieved by their corresponding devices. However, due to the factors such as morphology, electric field dependent geminate recombination, etc.,63 their devices suffer a slightly high Eloss of 0.6 eV for PM6:TSeTIC and 0.66 eV for PM6:SeTIC4Cl. In this work, the Eloss values of DTPPSe-IC, DTPPSe-2F and DTPPSe-4F based devices are 0.57 eV, 0.60 eV and 0.65 eV, respectively. The Eloss of 0.60 eV is quite low in both selenophene-containing NFAs and asymmetric NFA-based OSCs (Fig. S26 and Table S6, ESI†).
Conclusions
In summary, we have developed an asymmetric heptacyclic electron-donating core (DTPPSe) by flanking DTP and selenophene on two sides of a benzene ring via two cyclopentadienyl bridges.
Three novel selenophene-containing FRAs (DTPPSe-IC, DTPPSe-2F and DTPPSe-4F) were further synthesized to explore the effect of fluorinated end groups on their optoelectronic properties. Two FRAs with fluorinated end groups exhibit narrower Eoptgs and down-shifted LUMOs/HOMOs, and the corresponding devices achieve simultaneous increased μe and μh relative to DTPPSe-IC and its device. In particular, the better miscibility of DTPPSe-2F and PBDB-T endows the blend film with a homogeneous morphology featuring nanofibrous and ordered phase separation, which is beneficial for charge transport and exciton dissociation. As a result, the OSCs based on PBDB-T:DTPPSe-2F delivered an impressively high PCE of 13.76% with a JSC of 22.16 mA cm−2 and a FF of 73.70%, outperforming PBDB-T:DTPPSe-IC- and PBDB-T:DTPPSe-4F-based OSCs (9.88% and 12.03%, respectively). The PCE of PBDB-T:DTPPSe-2F is among the highest values for selenophene-containing FRA-based OSCs reported so far in the literature. Notably, the DTPPSe-2F-based device has a low Eloss of 0.60 eV, which is quite low in both selenophene-containing NFAs and asymmetric NFA-based OSCs. Our results not only indicate that the asymmetric heptacyclic intermediate core DTPPSe has the potential to design efficient narrow band gap FRAs, but also demonstrate that the monofluorinated end group can be utilized for efficient FRA structure construction.
