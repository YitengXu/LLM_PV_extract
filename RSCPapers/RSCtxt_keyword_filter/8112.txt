Perylene diimides are among the most investigated due to their excellent electron mobility, high electron affinity and feasible chemical modification. In this review, we summarize reports of small molecule acceptors based on perylene diimides in recent years and highlight the effect of molecular structure on their performance in bulk heterojunction organic solar cells with the hope of providing criteria for designing acceptors based on perylene diimides.Zhitian LiuZhitian Liu is a full professor of materials science and engineering at Wuhan Institute of Technology.

1. Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have been widely investigated for their light weight, short payback time, and the capability to fabricate flexible devices.1–9 The typical BHJ blend films consist of polymer donor materials and fullerene acceptor materials.10–12 Great advances in developing high efficiency polymer donor materials have been achieved.13 Fullerene and its derivatives are still the most popular electron acceptors because they exhibit strong electron affinity, high electron mobility, and ultrafast photo-induced charge transfer and charge separation.14 However, fullerene and its derivatives are too expensive for large-scale production and it is difficult to modify their chemical structure.12,15 During the last few years many efforts have been made to design and synthesize non-fullerene acceptors.16,17 Some new non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have shown potential to outperform fullerenes in comparative devices.18–22 To date, maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of BHJ OSCs based on NFAs over 12% has been reported.23 Research papers21,23–27 and a review28 are recommended for better understanding this kind of high efficiency fused-ring NFAs. Among the vast library of non-fullerene acceptors, perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives are also widely investigated due to their good electron-accepting ability, high electron mobility, especially various feasible methods to modify the frontier molecular orbital levels.29–34 However, it appears rather surprising that the utilization of PDIs in OSCs is still lagging behind fullerenes. This can be attributed to that PDI based acceptors are inclined to aggregate in large size in BHJ active layers due to their strong π–π stacking tendency.4 The micrometer-sized crystallite, namely, micrometer-sized domain inhibits charge separation at the donor/acceptor interface.9 Since the diffusion length of excitons is only 5–20 nm,31,35 moderate phase separation plays a vital role in achieving high efficiency. Besides, large aggregates facilitate excimer formation which traps excitons and thereby limits the diffusion length in PDIs and causes terminal loss of photo-induced excitons.32,36
To solve this problem, disrupting the planarity of PDIs has been proved to be a useful way to suppress the aggregation and enhance the photovoltaic performances. However, a decline in electron mobility usually comes with a twisted configuration. Since device performance depends largely on the charge-transport properties,37,38 it is important to suppress the aggregation while preserving high electron mobility. Besides, the modulation of photoelectric properties should also be taken into account when a new acceptor is designed.39 There are three functionalization positions in the PDI moiety: bay positions (1,6,7,12-positions), ortho positions (2,5,8,11-positions) and imide positions, as shown in Fig. 1. All of them can be used to construct the twisted configuration. (1) Functionalization at the bay position is a facile synthesis route to tune the optical and electronic properties and it is the easiest method to minimize the aggregation of PDI derivatives.34 Monobrominated or dibrominated perylene diimide is usually used as the initial raw material. With the help of large steric substituents at the bay position or formation of PDI dimers, aggregation can be effectively suppressed. (2) Functionalization at imide positions is not as effective as functionalization at the bay position to adjust the optical and electric properties because there are nodes at the imide nitrogen positions.26 But substituents at imide positions will not lead to distortion of the PDI core and thus maintain intermolecular interactions in the solid state while the non-planar conformation between the PDI core and substituents suppresses the intrinsic π–π stacking of PDIs in films. (3) Functionalization at the ortho position opens a new route to tune the properties of PDI effectively without disturbing the planarity of the perylene core, which combines a planar core and variable substituents with tunable properties and is considered as the most promising position to modify PDIs.32 (4) Another effective strategy to reduce aggregation is to construct a fused nonplanar configuration. It inhibits the rotation of the single bond and enhances the solid order for improving charge mobility, while maintaining a nonplanar structure to suppress aggregates.40,41 However, it is less investigated due to the relatively complicated synthesis route. Every method has its unique superiority and it is feasible to combine two or more methods to achieve optimal molecular geometry with desirable optical and electronic properties.

There is growing attention in developing non-fullerene acceptors in BHJ solar cells. This review focuses on small molecular NFAs based on perylene diimides with regard to not only remarkable high PCEs as described in other reviews, but also the development and optimization processes. The relationships between chemical molecular structures and energy levels, aggregation behaviors and the mobility are discussed, as well as the relationship between molecular geometry and OSC performances. This review probably sheds light on designing novel high efficiency acceptors based on perylene diimides. In order to make this review more readable, the structures of donor materials mentioned are drawn in Fig. 8 and the significant parameters of the acceptors are listed in Table 1.

2. Bay positions
Modifying PDI via the bay position is the most investigated way to functionalize PDI due to synthesis feasibility which has been proved successful in minimizing PDI aggregation.34 Introduction of alkyl chains or aromatic substituents to the PDI core results in a moderate dihedral angle between the two naphthalene planes and a large dihedral angle between the PDI core and substituent units due to steric effects. Moreover, the substituents also modify PDI with diverse properties, for instance, light absorption, carrier transport, frontier molecular orbitals, miscibility with donor materials and so on.
2.1 Mono PDI
X. Zhang et al. synthesized a series of solution-processable perylene diimide monomer-based acceptors (molecule 2.1, in Fig. 2) by replacing the 2-methoxylethoxyl groups in molecule 2.1a, one-by-one, with 4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene) (BDT) moieties in the bay region.42 Such structural modification not only enhanced the absorption in the wavelength range from 650 to 800 nm, but also reduced the aggregation tendency as a result of the twisted configuration. Molecule 2.1c (in Fig. 2) was twisted with a dihedral angle of 21° between the two naphthalene planes in the PDI core and 53° between the PDI unit and BDT unit. A smaller domain size of molecule 2.1c around 20 nm was observed while the domain size of its counterpart, molecule 2.1a, was around 0.5–1 μm. Due to the complementary absorption to the donor material, i.e. P3HT, and reduced phase size, a higher PCE of 1.66% based on molecule 2.1c was achieved although a sharp decrease of electron mobility comes with a twisted configuration. The electron mobility of P3HT:molecule 2.1a blends was estimated to be 6.71 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, while it is 1.96 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for P3HT:molecule 2.1c blends. Yunhao Cai et al. reported that when four phenyl groups were attached to the PDI unit at bay positions, molecule 2.2 showed a dihedral angle of 15° between the two naphthalene planes in the PDI core and 42° between the PDI unit and phenyl unit.43 With the PTB7-Th:molecule 2.2 blends, a maximum PCE of 4.1% was achieved with a Voc of 0.87 V, a Jsc of 10.1 mA cm−2, and an FF of 46.4%. Since symmetrical bis-substituted PDI derivatives are usually composed of 1,6- and 1,7-isomers,44 Jinduo Yi et al. synthesized a series of mono-aryl-substituted PDI molecules (molecules 2.3a–f, in Fig. 2).45,46 Results indicated that the para-alkyl side chain length showed negligible influence on the spectroscopy and frontier molecular orbital levels of the materials. The propyl substituted compound 2.3a showed the best photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 0.77%, Voc of 0.63 V, Jsc of 1.93 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.63. Then bulky isopropyl groups were introduced on the bay-phenyl unit to finely tune the molecular geometry of mono-substituted PDI derivatives. Although the bulky isopropyl group on the para- and meta-position of the bay-phenyl group has a negligible influence on optical properties and energy levels, better device performance was achieved using the meta-substituted PDI compound 2.3b because of the appropriate nano-scale phase separation and high electron mobility of the blend film.

2.2 PDI dimer
Constructing PDI dimers is an effective method to obtain highly efficient NFAs. Two PDI units can be linked by a single bond, single or fused aromatic rings. Molecule 3.1a (in Fig. 3) was linked by a single bond at the bay position which has a torsion angle of 70° between the two PDI units. It has been widely investigated.47–53 The LUMO and HOMO levels were −3.87 eV and −5.95 eV, respectively. Paired with PBDTTT-C-T, a PCE of 3.63% with a Voc of 0.73 V, a Jsc of 10.58 mA cm−2 and an FF of 46.80% was achieved.47 Since the value of Voc is closely related to the difference between the HOMO levels of donors and the LUMO levels of acceptors, deeper HOMO levels of donors yield higher Voc, which provides a higher PCE.10,54,55 When PBDTTT-CT was replaced by PBDTBDD which has deeper HOMO levels, it showed an enhanced Voc of 0.87 V and FF of 61.1%. Thereby, the PCE was improved to 4.39%.48 Long Ye et al. investigated the selection of donor polymers in achieving high efficiency by combining molecule 3.1a with different donor materials (PBDTTPD, PBDTTT-EFT, PSBTBT and PDPP3T, in Fig. 8), which have different energy levels, hole mobility and crystallinity.50 A PCE of 4.5% was achieved based on PBDTTT-EFT:molecule 3.1a as a result of complementary absorption, well-matched energy levels and moderate crystallinity of PBDTTT-EFT. Due to the high crystallinity, devices based on PDPP3T:molecule 3.1a exhibited a low PCE of 0.98%. Yue Zang et al. improved the efficiency of OSCs based on molecule 3.1a further to 5.90% in inverted cell architecture with a PC61BM-SAM modified ZnO layer.49 The Voc, Jsc and FF values were 0.8 V, 11.98 mA cm−2 and 59%, respectively. In their work, a more intense absorption fraction in the inverted device than that in the conventional device was observed. It might be attributed to the different sequences and optical properties of each layer. The inverted devices exhibit higher charge generation than the conventional ones due to better optical distribution. Moreover, in an inverted structure, the metal oxides can provide sufficient protection to the active organic layer.56 It was also reported that the number of donors and acceptors at the active layer surface (RD/A) is always larger at the top surface than at the bottom surface, which is beneficial for charge extraction in the inverted devices.57 The PC61BM-SAM layer was used to passivate the charge-trapping hydroxyl groups on the ZnO layer and help the charge extraction from the BHJ to the electrode, resulting in reduced recombination both in the BHJ layer and BHJ/electrode interface. When strong electron withdrawing cyano groups were attached to molecule 3.1a, the resulting molecule 3.1c (in Fig. 3) exhibits a deep LUMO level of −4.56 eV which is the lowest among electron acceptors based on PDI derivatives at present.58 OSCs based on molecule 3.1c exhibited a low PCE of 1.4% due to enhanced energy loss which is usually linked to the large LUMO offset between donors and acceptors.59
 Fig. 3  PDI dimers bridged via bay positions. 
Other than the single bond, the linkage units can also be π-bridges, for example thiophene units.57,60–68 Xin Zhang et al. linked two PDI units via a thiophene group, and a PCE of 4.03% was achieved based on molecule 3.2d (in Fig. 3) with a Voc of 0.85 V, a Jsc of 8.86 mA cm−2 and an FF of 54.1%.60 The LUMO and HOMO levels were estimated to be −3.84 eV and −5.65 eV by cyclic voltammetry (CV), which has balanced energy offsets to the polymer donor, PBDTTT-C-T, i.e., ΔELUMO ≈ ΔEHOMO (0.59 eV vs. 0.54 eV). The balanced offsets ensure effective hole and electron transfer in both donor and acceptor phases. It was indicated by molecular modeling that the molecule 3.2d had a highly twisted configuration with the dihedral angles of 50–65° between the PDI unit and thiophene unit. Compared to its monomeric counterpart molecule 2.1a, the domain size of which was around several hundred nanometers, molecule 3.2d showed dramatic reduced aggregation with a phase domain around 30 nm. Besides, molecule 3.2d showed a broader absorption spectrum owing to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition and extension of the conjugated length. When Xin Zhang et al. fine-tuned the parameters of fabrication such as solvent vapor annealing (SVA),69 annealing time and content of solvent additives used in the film forming process, the monomolecular and bimolecular recombination reduced and the electron mobility improved.64 The Jsc significantly increased from 5.4 to 12.85 mA cm−2 and a maximum PCE of 6.08% was achieved. By screening the content of additives, the phase separation, phase size and aggregate order can be optimized. It was reported that blends processed with DIO exhibited higher charge mobility as a result of increased structural order as well as phase separation.61,70 Besides, solvent additives are beneficial for electronic coupling of adjacent PDI aggregates and thus achieve more balanced hole/electron transport.71,72 It was also reported that surface D/A composition of the active layer can be optimized by adjusting the content of DIO, which can be ascribed to the different boiling points of DIO and the main processing solvent, different solubilities of the donor and acceptor in DIO, and different wettabilities of the donor-DIO and acceptor-DIO solutions on the PEDOT:PSS or ZnO substrates.57,64,68 In the work of Zhenhuan Lu and co-workers in the active layer of PBDTT-C-T:molecule 3.2c, as [DIO] ranges from 0 to 15%, the RD/A on the top surface was in the range of 2.0–5.3 while the RD/A on the bottom surface was in the range of 0.3–0.84.57RD/A on both the top and bottom surfaces showed an increasing tendency with the content of DIO increasing. The best PCE of 4.34% in the inverted devices was obtained at a low [DIO] of 2%, while the best PCE of 3.28% in conventional devices was obtained at a high [DIO] of 7% (as shown in Table 1). The holes are extracted from the bottom surface in the conventional devices and the electrons are extracted from the bottom surface in the inverted ones. At low [DIO], the bottom surface exhibited low RD/A, i.e. acceptor abundance, which was favourable for electron extraction in the inverted devices. At higher [DIO], relatively higher donor abundance was favourable for hole extraction in the conventional devices. In addition, whether in the inverted devices or conventional devices, devices processed without [DIO] exhibited the lowest PCE. Recently, Xin Zhang et al. improved the PCE of molecule 3.2d based OSCs further to 7.24% by integration of film-morphology optimization, and cathode interlayer engineering and using PBDT-TS1 as the donor material.65 A combination of solvent annealing (SA) and SVA treatments was used to optimize film morphology, which helped to achieve more balanced hole/electron mobility. Additionally, Ca and PDINO were used as the cathode layer in their work to reduce bimolecular loss. Zhenhuan Lu et al. synthesized molecule 3.2b, molecule 3.2d and molecule 3.2e (in Fig. 3) to investigate the impact of molecular solvophobicity versus solvophilicity on the performance of devices based on PDI.73 2-Methoxyethoxyl (EG) groups were introduced to the thiophene-bridged PDI dimers at bay positions to adjust molecular solvophobicity (0 EG for molecule 3.2b, 2 EG for molecule 3.2d and 4 EG for molecule 3.2e). With the number of EG groups increasing, molecular solvophobicity versus solvophilicity and solution-processablity improved, and the strong aggregation ability reduced. In consequence, the best PCE of OSC devices improved from 0.41% for molecule 3.2b to 0.76% for molecule 3.2d and then further to 1.54% for molecule 3.2e when using P3HT as the donor material. Jiayu Wang et al. synthesized a set of bay-linked PDI dimers with different oligothiophene bridges, namely molecules P0TP–P3TP (in Fig. 3) used as electron acceptors in BHJ OSCs.63 The length of spacers had a great influence on the absorption properties, energy levels, electron mobility, morphology and so on. With the introduction of the thiophene unit, the dihedral angles between two PDI units reduced, and the miscibility with the polymer donor increased, resulting in smoother morphology in blend films. With increasing length of oligothiophene bridges, the absorption spectra red shifted and the maximum extinction coefficients increased. However, the electron mobility decreased from 2.4 × 10−4 to 4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the active layer blended with PBDTTT-C-T with increasing length of oligothiophene bridges (n = 1–3). Molecule P0TP (n = 0) exhibited the lowest electron mobility of 7 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1. Molecule P1TP with one thiophene unit as the spacer has the highest electron mobility and the best PCE. The spacer geometry also has a great influence on the performance of acceptors based on PDI dimers. In the work of Xin Zhang and co-workers, they increased the number of thiophene units to six and synthesized molecules bis-PDI-1T-EG to bis-PDI-6T-EG (in Fig. 3).74 As the length of the oligothiophene bridge increased, the absorption in the near IR region from 650 to 900 nm increased due to ICT absorption from oligothiophene units to PDI units. The HOMO levels increased from −5.65 to −5.10 eV, while there was little change in LUMO levels. It was reported that the HOMO levels were mainly related to oligothiophene units, while the LUMO levels were mainly determined by perylene in these molecules. Wisnu Tantyo Hadmojo and co-workers reported two PDI dimers, molecule 3.3a and molecule 3.3b (in Fig. 3).75 Molecule 3.3a was bridged by a bithiophene unit and molecule 3.3b was obtained by inserting a 2,5-difluorobenzene (F2B) moiety to the spacer. Due to noncovalent S–F coulombic interaction,76,77 the planarity of the spacer in molecule 3.3b was improved compared to that in molecule 3.3a. Molecule 3.3b showed a dihedral angle of 2.7° between the F2B unit and the thiophenes while the dihedral angle between two thiophene units in molecule 3.3a was 21.5°. Thereby molecule 3.3b exhibited enhanced intermolecular packing which resulted in higher electron mobility (3.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1vs. 6.0 ×
10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1). In addition, molecule 3.3b still showed a twisted configuration with a dihedral angle of 59.6° between the spacer and PDI moieties which prevented excessive phase aggregation. In consequence, a higher PCE of 5.05% was achieved based on molecule 3.3b with a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 10.60 mA cm−2, and an FF of 57% while a PCE of 3.63% was achieved based on molecule 3.3a with a Voc of 0.82 V, a Jsc of 8.95 mA cm−2, and an FF of 49%. Jingbo Zhao et al. studied the relationship between the spacer geometry and the OSC performances by designing molecule 3.4a and molecule 3.4b in which two PDI moieties were linked by bithiophene spacers with two methyl groups attached to different locations as shown in Fig. 3.78 The small difference in the chemical structures of molecules 3.4a and 3.4b resulted in significant difference in molecular geometry. The dihedral angles between the two PDI moieties are about 60° in molecule 3.4a and 90° in molecule 3.4b, and the dihedral angles between the two thiophene rings were 54° and 17° in molecules 3.4a and 3.4b, respectively, resulting in a smaller domain size of molecule 3.4a than that of molecule 3.4b in the blend films when they were paired with PffBT4T-2DT (in Fig. 8). In consequence, a PCE of 4.1% was achieved based on molecule 3.4a with a Voc of 0.91 V, a Jsc of 8.0 mA cm−2, and an FF of 56% while a PCE of 3.1% was achieved based on molecule 3.4b with a Voc of 0.89 V, a Jsc of 6.8 mA cm−2, and an FF of 51%. Xin Zhang et al. reported a new PDI acceptor molecule 3.5 (in Fig. 3) by replacing the thiophene unit in molecule 3.2d with a selenophene unit.79 When paired with PBDTTT-C-T without the use of additives, a PCE of 4.01% was achieved based on molecule 3.5 with a Voc of 0.79 V, a Jsc of 10.60 mA cm−2, and an FF of 47.93%. As shown in Fig. 3, other aromatic units were also used to construct the PDI dimer, for instance, BDT (molecule 3.6),80,81 phenyl (molecules 3.7a, 3.7b, 3,7c),40,82 biphenyl (molecule 3.7d, in Fig. 3),83 9,9′-spirobi[9H-fluorene] (SBF) (molecules 3.7e, 3.7f),19,82,84,85 indaceno [1,2-b:5,6-b′] dithiophene (IDT) (molecule 3.8),86 1,1-diphenylcyclohexane (molecule 3.9),87etc. Among these PDI dimers, molecule 3.7e bridged by SBF was the mostly studied dimer. Molecule 3.7e1 was first reported by Qifan Yan and co-workers.82 SBF exhibits an orthogonal molecular structure, where two planar fluorene units are connected through a spiro-sp3 carbon.88,89 When molecule 3.7e1 was paired with P3HT, a PCE of 2.35% was achieved. When molecule 3.7e1 was combined with a well matched donor PffBT4T-2DT, a PCE of 6.3% was achieved with a Voc of 0.98 V, a Jsc of 10.7 mA cm−2 and an FF of 57%.84 Interestingly, the LUMO offset between PffBT4T-2DT and molecule 3.7e1 was merely 0.12 eV. When molecule 3.7e1 was combined with P3TEA (in Fig. 8), an impressive PCE of 9.5% was achieved with negligible driving force (energy difference between the bandgap and charge transfer states) in OSC devices.19 The LUMO levels and HOMO levels were determined to be −3.62 eV and −5.99 eV for molecule 3.7e1, and −3.57 eV and −5.37 eV for P3TEA by CV. Although the LUMO offset was merely 0.05 eV in the P3TEA:molecule 3.7e1 combination, there was still efficient charge generation and separation. The OSC devices exhibited a low voltage loss of 0.61 V and an impressive Voc of 1.11 V. In contrast, a PCE of 6.1% was achieved with a Voc of 0.965 V, a Jsc of 11.04 mA cm−2 and an FF of 57.5% based on PffBT4T-2DT:molecule 3.7e1 which exhibited a driving force of 0.16 eV, and a PCE of 7.0% was achieved with a Voc of 0.954 V, a Jsc of 12.46 mA cm−2 and an FF of 59.1% based on P3TEA:molecule 3.1b which exhibited a driving force of 0.2 eV. Their work showed that a small driving force was sufficient for charge separation. S. Dai et al. synthesized molecule 3.10 by linking two perylene diimide units by thienylene vinylene.90 Although it exhibited strong absorption in the visible region (300–800 nm), an OSC based on PBDTTT-C-T:molecule 3.10 exhibited a PCE of 0.69%.
2.3 Core(PDI)n
One advantage of fullerene derivatives is their ball or near-ball-shape structures which can possibly form a 3D charge-transporting network.1 PDI derivatives can also potentially possess a quasi-3D nonplanar structure. Usually, with the help of the steric effect, these PDI acceptors with 3D geometry exhibit interlocking or compact molecular structures that PDI moieties orientate to different directions. This suppresses aggregation of acceptors in BHJ blend films efficiently and facilitates nanoscale phase domain formation. Besides, it benefits energy transfer and electron transport among PDI moieties. More importantly, it enables multidimensional charge transport and separation.
Yuze Lin et al. reported a star-shaped molecule 4.1a (in Fig. 4) with a triphenylamine (TPA) core which possesses a quasi-3D nonplanar structure and isotropic optical and charge-transporting properties.91 TPA exhibited a starburst molecular structure due to the sp3 hybrid orbital of the core nitrogen atom.9 It was often used to construct a star-shaped structure.91–93 Molecule 4.1a showed weak molecular aggregation and strong absorption in the visible region which was complementary to that of common low bandgap polymer donors. A maximum PCE of 3.45% was achieved based on molecule 4.1a with a high Jsc of 11.92 mA cm−2 and a moderate Voc of 0.88 V. However, it showed a low FF of 33.6% which might be attributed to an unbalanced electron/hole mobility (7.17 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1/2.32 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). Qichao Wu synthesized an acceptor with perylene diimide linked through a thiophene ring with TPA, i.e. molecule 4.1b (in Fig. 4).94 A strong absorption peak appeared in the 330 nm to 450 nm region because introduction of the thiophene unit resulted in an extended molecular absorption spectrum. OSCs based on a PBDTTT-C-T:molecule 4.1b blend film with a 3% DIO additive exhibited PCE of 1.92%. Shuixing Li and co-workers synthesized a PDI trimer, molecule 4.2 (in Fig. 4), in which three PDI units were attached to one benzene core.95 It showed a twisted molecular geometry with a compact arrangement of sterically bulky PDI moieties. In the PTB7-Th:molecule 4.2 blends, PDI trimers formed nano-sized molecular particles with the aromatic π surface towards the outside. The short-range stacking of PDI molecules facilitates electron transport. A maximum PCE of 5.65% with a Voc of 0.83 V, a Jsc of 13.12 mA cm−2, and an FF of 52% was achieved for the device. A tetraphenylethylene (TPE) core-based molecule 4.3 (in Fig. 4), TPE-PDI4, with a unique 3D molecular structure of a four-wing propeller-shape was reported by Yuhang Liu et al.83 Whereas the HOMO, LUMO, and UV-Vis spectrum of molecule 4.3 are similar to those of molecule 3.7d, TPE-PDI4 exhibits enhanced electron mobility (1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1vs. 2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and smaller domain size (20 nm vs. 60–80 nm). It indicates that the 3D structure can facilitate charge transport. Spiro-bifluorene is a rigid perpendicular unit which is favorable for constructing 3D geometry. Jaewon Lee et al. reported a 3D PDI acceptor, molecule 4.4 (in Fig. 4) with a spiro-bifluorene core.96 It exhibited an interlocking geometry which reinforced uniformity of the molecular conformation. A PCE of 5.98% was achieved with a Voc of 0.9 V, a Jsc of 12.02 mA cm−2 and an FF of 54.2% in devices based on PV4T2FBT:molecule 4.4 blends. Lei Yang and co-workers made a comparison between molecule 4.4c (in Fig. 4) and molecule 3.7e2.85 In devices based on both PTB7-Th:acceptor and PffBT4T-2OD:acceptor blends, molecule 4.4c outperformed molecule 3.7e2. As shown in Table 1, the PCEs were 5.01% vs. 1.72% with PTB7-Th:acceptor blends and 4.09% vs. 3.05% with PffBT4T-2OD:acceptor blends. Besides, molecule 4.4c exhibited higher electron mobility. It once again indicated that the 3D structure with a compact and interlocked configuration was favourable for achieving high efficiency in OSC devices. Shi-Yong Liu and co-workers reported a 3D PDI acceptor, molecule 4.5c (in Fig. 4), in which the tetraphenyl-silane core was coupled with four PDI units.97 These four PDI units were compact, interlocked, and non-rotatable. When molecule 4.5c was combined with PBDTT-F-TT, a PCE of 3.54% was achieved with a Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 8.39 mA cm−2 and an FF of 49%. Yuhang Liu and co-workers made a comparison among molecule 4.5b, molecule 4.5d and molecule 4.5e, which had different core atoms (in Fig. 4).98 Although the sizes of the core atoms were different (C < Si < Ge), they showed similar 3D molecular structures and optical bandgaps. All blend films of PffBT4T-2DT with these three molecules exhibited smooth morphology and relatively small domains. However, they performed differently in the OSC devices. A PCE of 4.3% was achieved in devices based on PffBT4T-2DT:molecule 4.5b with a Voc of 0.96 V, a Jsc of 9.2 mA cm−2 and an FF of 49% and a PCE of 4.2% was achieved in devices based on PffBT4T-2DT:molecule 4.5d with a Voc of 0.94 V, a Jsc of 8.5 mA cm−2 and an FF of 53% while a PCE of 1.6% was achieved in devices based on PffBT4T-2DT:molecule 4.5e with a Voc of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 5.0 mA cm−2 and an FF of 37%. As shown in Table 1, the low PCE of molecule 4.5d could be attributed to the much lower electron mobility. Since excessive extent of twisting would hurt the charge mobility of the NFA, a comparative study of photovoltaic performance among molecules 4.3, 4.5b and 4.6 (in Fig. 4) with different extents of the intramolecular twisting was performed by Haoran Lin et al.99 Compared to molecules 4.3 and 4.5b, the tetraphenylpyrazine (TPPz) core in molecule 4.6 is less twisted because not only the core is bigger in size but also there are no hydrogen atoms attached to the center pyrazine unit. The electron mobility of pure molecule 4.6 was estimated to be as high as (2.3 ± 0.2) × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The authors ascribed the blue-shift of the main absorption peak of molecule 4.6 from solution to film to the H-aggregation process in the film. Although molecule 4.6 exhibits the lowest extent of intramolecular twisting and thus a stronger aggregation, reasonably small domain size and clear phase separation were observed in the blend film based on PffBT-T3(1,2)-2:molecule 4.6. The highest PCE of 7.1% was achieved in the inverted devices using molecule 4.6 as the acceptor with a Voc of 0.99 V, a Jsc of 12.7 mA cm−2 and an FF of 57%. As the extent of intramolecular twisting increases, the PCEs decrease not only in the blend of PffBT-T3(1,2)-2:molecule 4.6, but also in the blend of P3HT:molecule 4.6 and PTB7-Th:molecule 4.6. 9,9′-Bifluorenylidene, which could be used as an electron acceptor in BHJ OSCs,100 was chosen as the core to construct the (core)PDIn-type twisted acceptor, i.e. molecule 4.7 (in Fig. 4).101 Devices incorporating PTB7-Th as the electron donor outperformed those based on PTB7, largely due to higher short-circuit current density (Jsc), which may be a result of the broadened absorption coverage of the blend of PTB7-Th:molecule 4.7 relative to that of PTB7:molecule 4.7. Optimized PCE of 3.64% was achieved for PTB7-Th:molecule 4.7 with a Voc of 0.82 V, a Jsc of 9.35 mA cm−2 and an FF of 45.55%.
 Fig. 4  Multidimensional PDIs substituted via bay positions. 
In conclusion, the photoelectric and physical properties of PDI derivatives modified via the bay position vary with different substituents. (1) Molecular geometry. Molecular geometry, which can be modified by choosing appropriate spacer units, significantly affects the packing behaviour, electron mobility and film morphology, which has close relationship with the exciton diffusion/separation, charge transport, and, finally, the PCE. (2) Light absorption. Usually, PDI derivatives linked via bay positions exhibit strong absorption in the visible region of 400–600 nm, and introducing electron-donating groups can extend the absorption band. (3) Energy levels. Introduction of electron-withdrawing units leads to lower LUMO energy levels while electron-donating units have an inverse effect. Novel acceptors with twisted molecular geometry, high electron mobility, complementary absorption spectrum, appropriate energy levels, which can also form good film morphology with the polymer donor, are quite promising.
3. Imide positions
Functionalization at the bay position can form a twisted configuration, providing a good solution to inhibit aggregation. However, it also disturbs the planarity of the PDI core, and weakens the interaction between the molecules. Planarity is believed to favor solid-state packing and carrier transport. Intermolecular electronic orbital overlap within the stacks is essential for electron transport materials. It enhances mobility compared to that in amorphous materials.102 The crystallinity of the acceptor domains promotes charge delocalization, thereby increasing charge dissociation. Geminate recombination loss of bound polaron pairs can be reduced by ordering the solid state. Functionalization at imide positions is the simplest way to modify PDI without twisting the PDI core, but it is less investigated than functionalization at bay positions due to the limited substituents and little effect on the optical and electronic properties of PDIs.103
At first, alkyl chains and aromatic groups were introduced to imide positions of PDI monomers. They notably affect the solubility and molecular packing behaviors of PDI derivatives. Alkyl side chains of “swallow tail” at the imide positions can disturb the packing structure and thus minimize the formation of large PDI domains. PDI with alkyl chains at the nitrogen position can be readily synthesized. Hence, they were widely investigated. They exhibit good solubility, crystallinity, and PCEs ranging from 1% to 5% in different devices.70,71,104–111 The best PCE of 5.13% was obtained for the device based on p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:molecule 5.1a (in Fig. 5) with a Jsc of 10.07 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.80 V, and an FF of 63.6%. Jon-Paul Sun and co-workers studied the impact of alkyl side chains on the photovoltaic performance of PDIs in OSC cells by comparison of molecules 5.1a–5.1d (in Fig. 5). The alkyl side chains drastically affect the solubility, film formation, and packing behaviors of PDI. When paired with F-DTS, molecule 5.1a showed the best PCE of 3.21% while molecule 5.1d showed negligible PCE. Besides, all of the molecules exhibited good solubility, but molecule 5.1d showed significantly lower solubility. Because the 2-ethylhexyl side chain has a branching point on carbon 2 as opposed to carbon 1, branching at carbon 2 has a lower sterical effect and it exhibited enhanced π–π stacking among PDI chromophores.
 Fig. 5  Acceptors substituted via imide positions. 
Heinz Langhals and Wolfgang Jona linked two PDI units with a hydrazine bond at the imide position with different alkyl chains, with yields ranging from 29% to 56%.112 The PDI dimer, molecule 5.2a (in Fig. 5), which was demonstrated to be a potential alternative to fullerenes, is highly rigid with a 90° torsion angle between the two PDI planes. It was reported by Sridhar Rajaram and co-workers that the blend films consisting of the polymer donor PBDTTT-C-T and molecule 5.2a showed broad spectral coverage and moderate phase separation, yielding device efficiency of 2.78% with a Jsc of 9.5 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.76 V and a FF of 0.46.113 As is well known, the alkyl chains also affect the device performance.52 By shortening the alkyl side chain, molecule 5.2b was obtained. Additionally, by adjusting the polymer donor material, the efficiency can be further improved. In Chen-Hao Wu and co-workers' work, a promising PCE of 6.41% was achieved for the PTB7-Th:molecule 5.2b BHJ devices with a LUMO offset of 0.12 eV, while the bay-linked counterpart molecule 3.1a demonstrated a PCE of 5.56%.53 The Voc, Jsc, and FF values of OSCs based on molecule 5.2b and molecule 3.1a were 0.79 V vs. 0.79 V, 13.12 mA cm−2vs. 12.86 mA cm−2, and 60% vs. 54%, respectively. This difference can be ascribed to the charge mobility. Both of them had good miscibility with PTB7-Th, while the rigid molecule 5.2b also maintained appropriate aggregation domains which were favorable for charge transport. Besides, it was demonstrated by two-dimensional grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D GIWAXS) that the bay-linked dimer, molecule 3.1a disrupted the π–π stacking of the polymer donor severely, while PTB7-Th:molecule 5.2b blend film did not. Hence PTB7-Th:molecule 5.2b blend film exhibited higher charge mobility (4.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1vs. 9.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for electron mobility and 2.3 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1vs. 1.7 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 for hole mobility). Ningning Liang and co-workers reported a PDI trimer as an acceptor linked via the imide position with a synthesis yield of 28%.114 A PCE as high as 7.25% was achieved based on PBDT-TS1:molecule 5.3 blends. It exhibited a Voc of 0.732 V, a high Jsc of 16.52 mA cm−2, and an FF of 60.03%. It was reported that by increasing the amount of PDI units via imide positions in PDI oligomers, the extinction coefficient can be strikingly improved. More importantly, despite the nodes in both the HOMO and LUMO of PDI, linking PDI molecules via an N–N bond helps to change their reduction potential.115 When the PDI moieties are isoenergetic, rapid electron hopping can be found in these linear PDI oligomers.116 It acts as a complementary charge transfer route to intermolecular interactions based on π–π stacking. Attaching multiple PDI units via the imide position provides a potential method of molecule design for acceptors based on PDI derivatives.
The properties of functionalized PDI derivatives at the imide position also varied with the linkage units. For example, Guangpeng Gao and co-workers reported a set of chiral PDI dimers, molecules 5.4a–5.4c (in Fig. 5) which were bridged with twisted 1,2-diaminocyclohexane (DACH).117 Devices based on PDI dimers bridged with racemic DACH (molecule 5.4c) showed a maximum PCE of 4.68%, which is superior to 4.42% of a PDI dimer bridged with enantiomerically pure 1R,2R-DACH (molecule 5.4a) and 4.36% of a PDI dimer bridged with 1S,2S-DACH (molecule 5.4b). Better miscibility between molecule 5.4c and the donor polymer might account for the superiority. GiEun Park and co-workers reported a V-shaped PDI dimer which was linked by a sp3-bridge, 1,1-diphenylcyclohexane via imide positions.87 Compared to its bay-linked counterpart molecule 3.9 (in Fig. 3), molecule 5.5 (in Fig. 5) exhibited higher electron mobility (1.39 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1vs. 1.15 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1) and appropriate multi-dimensional interconnectivity of donor and acceptor phases in the BHJ blend. What's more, PPDT2FBT:molecule 5.5 blends showed relatively balanced charge transport (μh/μe ≈ 7.70), compared to that in PPDT2FBT:molecule 3.9 blends (μh/μe ≈ 37.04), which explained the higher FF of PPDT2FBT:molecule 5.5 blends. Hence, a higher PCE of 5.28% was achieved with a Jsc of 10.04 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.87 V, and an FF of 60.16% in devices based on PPDT2FBT:molecule 5.5 blends, while a PCE of 2.14% was achieved with a Jsc of 6.04 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.89 V and an FF of 39.84% in devices based on PPDT2FBT:molecule 3.9 blends. Tetraphenyl methane was selected by Wangqiao Chen et al. to construct a quasi-3D non-planar structure due to its tetrahedral architecture.118 Molecule 5.6 (in Fig. 5) possesses a dihedral angle of 110.17° between the PDI units and the phenyl core. A PCE of 2.73% was reported with a Voc of 0.77 V, a Jsc of 7.83 mA cm−2, and an FF of 45.0% based on PBDTTT-C-T:molecule 5.6.

        ortho positions
Since the functionalization at 2,5,8,11-positions of PDI was fulfilled by Satomi Nakazono et al. in 2009, it has been widely investigated.119,120 Usually, functionalization at ortho positions is achieved via ruthenium catalyzed reactions or iridium catalyzed reactions.121,122 Substitutions at ortho positions maintain the planarity of the perylene π-plane, which provides a promising method to tune the properties of perylene dyes without geometric distortion of the PDI core.32,123
Valentin Kamm and co-workers made a comparison between ortho-substituted molecule 6.1 (in Fig. 6) and molecule 5.1c (in Fig. 5) which had similar molecular weights.104 A higher PCE of 0.29% was achieved in devices based on molecule 6.1 than those based on molecule 5.1c when using P3HT as the donor material. It was indicated by time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy that a H-aggregate formed between chromophores in molecule 5.1c, while not in molecule 6.1. As is well known, the π-stacking in films plays a vital role in energy and charge transport. While rapid excimer formation usually comes with H-aggregates,124 J-aggregation prevents the necessary coupling for excimer formation and preserves good π-stacking for charge transport. A maximum diffusion length of 96 nm has been found in J-aggregates for PDI derivatives, which is much larger than that in disordered materials.125 Patrick E. Hartnett et al. reported a set of ortho substituted PDI monomers, molecule 6.2, molecule 6.3, and molecule 6.4a (in Fig. 6).126 These molecules were shown to organize in slip-tacked structures, namely J-aggregation with increasing slip angles, while PDI monomers without substitution at ortho positions self-assembled in H-aggregation. As the slip angles increased, the electron mobility of these ortho substituted PDIs in TFT devices under ambient conditions increased too. The values of electron mobility were 1.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for molecule 6.2, 4.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for molecule 6.3, and 2.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for molecule 6.4a (as shown in Table 1). When they were paired with PBTI3T, PCEs of 0.65%, 1.2% and 3.67% were achieved based on molecules 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4a, respectively, following the trend of electron mobility. Molecule 6.4a showed the smallest crystalline grains with a size around 2–5 nm. Its singlet exciton lifetime was around 200 ps, significantly longer than that in most PDI films where excimers form rapidly. Patrick E. Hartnett and co-workers later reported that the packing geometries of the ortho-substituted molecule 6.4b (in Fig. 6) can be manipulated by modulating the content of solvent additives (DIO).127 At a low concentration of DIO (<0.5 v%), the crystal motif organization in the slip-stacked structure is dominant. As the DIO concentration increased (>0.5 v%), the herringbone structure appeared. When the DIO concentration was 0.5 v%, the PDI purely slip-stacked in domains and the best PCE of 3.62% was achieved based on PBDTT-FTTE:molecule 6.4b blends. It was indicated by the photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiments that both molecular packing motifs underwent rapid charge transfer and it is even more rapid in the herringbone structure, while faster geminate recombination was observed in the herringbone structure. The acceptor with the herringbone structure exhibits stronger interaction with the polymer donor than that with the slip-stacked structure, whereas it is demonstrated that a larger D/A separation distance is beneficial for charge separation. Increased steric bulk at the D/A interface might decrease the Coulomb binding strength, thereby facilitating charge separation.128 Besides, diminished coupling between adjacent PDI chromophores in the herringbone structure stimulates formation of coulombically trapped charge transfer states.129ortho-Substituted PDI can also be used to construct dimers, and they were verified to outperform bay-linked dimers. Donglin Zhao and co-workers linked two PDI units with a BDT unit and a pyrene diimide (PDI) unit via the ortho-position, as shown in Fig. 6.81 Paired with PTB7-Th, an average PCE value of 4.76% was measured with a Jsc of 12.74 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.81 V, an FF of 46% and electron mobility of 8.00 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 based on ortho-linked molecule 6.5, while an average PCE of only 3.49% was reported for the PTB7-Th:molecule 3.6 with a Voc of 0.81 V, a Jsc of 9.8 mA cm−2, and an FF of 44% with electron mobility of 4.81 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The difference can also be found in the contrast between molecule 6.6 and bay-linked PDI dimer by the PDI unit. The torsion angle of the two naphthalimide planes in the PDI core was 2.0° in molecule 6.5, and 20.2° in molecule 3.6. However, the dihedral angle between the linker and PDI core in molecule 6.5 was 45.96°, similar to 47.79° in molecule 3.6. Hence, the blend films showed similar morphology. The domains of molecule 6.5 showed enhanced intermolecular π–π interaction and solid order, which facilitates charge transport. It accounts for the different electron mobilities. Qinghe Wu et al. synthesized a quasi-3D molecule 6.7 (in Fig. 6) with cross-like geometry.130 A maximum PCE of 8.47% was achieved based on PTB7-Th:molecule 6.7 with a Voc of 0.79 V, a Jsc of 17.9 mA cm−2, and an FF of 58%. Interestingly, with its unique molecular geometry, only one of the four PDI units in molecule 6.7 can have optimized π–π interaction with the polymer donors due to the steric effect. When charge transfer takes place at the D/A interface, the electron can transmit to other PDI units which are farther away from the donor polymer. The electron–hole binding energy between the polymer donor and acceptor reduced due to the longer distance. It opens a new avenue to manipulate the interaction between acceptors and polymer donors, which has great effects on charge separation.

5. Fused PDI
It was reported that π-extension of the PDI core can increase the packing order and anion delocalization in the solid state. Besides, it facilitates exciton diffusion. Thus, it enhances charge mobility and facilitates charge separation. Additionally, the spectral coverage is broadened and the energy levels are modified at the same time.131–133 It indicates that fused PDI with enforced rigidity is a promising generation of electron acceptors in OSC devices. Molecules such as molecule 7.1, with π-extension on the PDI core along the molecular axis (as described in Fig. 7), are widely applied as NIR dyes.134 π-Extension of the PDI core along the equatorial axis is more investigated to design electron acceptors in OSCs.

Yu Zhong et al. reported a series of helical conjugated PDI oligomers bridged by double-carbon bonds, molecules 7.2a–7.2c (in Fig. 7).135,136 A PCE of 6.05% was achieved based on PBDTT-TT:molecule 7.2a, with a Jsc of 13.3 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.803 V, and an FF of 56.6%. Blended with PTB7-Th, a PCE of 7.9% was reported based on molecule 7.2b with a Jsc of 14.5 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.81 V, and an FF of 67% and an outstanding PCE of 8.27% was obtained using molecule 7.2c as the acceptor with a Jsc of 15.1 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.81 V, and an FF of 68.2%. The high performance might be attributed to their special motifs of a mesh-like network in the solid state. It was characterized by AFM that an interpenetrating network formed in the blend film, which enabled ultrafast spatial charge separation. It indicated that ring fusion of the π-system was an effective approach to develop acceptors. Patrick E. Hartnett and co-workers reported a series of bay-linked PDI dimers, planar fused PDI molecule 7.3 (in Fig. 7) and nonplanar fused PDI molecule 7.4 (in Fig. 7).40 They found that generally nonplanar fused PDI showed better performance than bay-linked PDI dimers and planar fused PDI. For example, when paired with PBDTT-FTTE, nonplanar fused molecule 7.4 (in Fig. 7) exhibited a PCE of 3.89% with a Jsc of 7.68 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.93 V, and an FF of 54.3%, while planar fused molecule 7.3 (in Fig. 7) exhibited a PCE of 0.23% with a Jsc of 1.51 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.89 V, and an FF of 29.3% and bay-linked PDI molecule 3.7a (in Fig. 3) exhibited a PCE of 2.19% with a Jsc of 5.50 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.91 V, and an FF of 41.3%. Since all of the devices did not show large acceptor domains, the difference in performance might be ascribed to the fact that planar fused PDI interacted with polymer donors too tightly, which facilitated the formation of trapped CT states, and thus increased geminate recombination loss. Hongliang Zhong et al. reported a series of nonplanar fused PDI derivatives, molecules 7.5a–7.5c (in Fig. 7) which were fused with heterocycles.41 The dihedral angle between two PDI units increased as the atom size of O, S, and Se increased. The values were 15.8°, 24.4°, and 27.2°, respectively. It indicated a tunable geometry structure of fused PDI. The dihedral angles between the PDI planes played a critical role in molecular packing. Molecule 7.5b with modest twist angles had the best packing order. The electron mobility of molecules 7.5a–7.5c was estimated to be 3.17 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1, 1.63 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.21 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 respectively. The device efficiency decreased following the trend of electron mobility. When they were blended with PTB7-Th, a maximum PCE of 6.72% was achieved based on molecule 7.5b with a Voc of 0.94 V, a Jsc of 12.48 mA cm−2, and an FF of 58.0%, while a maximum PCE of 5.77% was achieved based on molecule 7.5c with a Voc of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 11.19 mA cm−2 and an FF of 55.0%, and a maximum PCE of 3.29% was achieved based on molecule 7.5a with a Voc of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 8.71 mA cm−2 and an FF of 40.0%. Qinqin Shi et al. synthesized molecule 7.6 through a novel method of iodination reaction.137 A maximum PCE of 4.7% was achieved in devices based on PBDTT-F-TT:molecule 7.6 blends with a Voc of 0.94 V, a Jsc of 9.74 mA cm−2, and an FF of 49.6%. Dan Sun et al. extended the molecule 3.1a with two thiophene units along the equatorial axis and obtained a new acceptor, molecule 7.7a (in Fig. 7).138 The device performance improved incredibly. An excellent PCE of 7.16% was achieved in the PDBT-T1:molecule 7.7a blend, which was much higher than the highest reported PCE of molecule 3.1a, 5.9%. The values of Jsc, Voc, and FF were 11.65 mA cm−2, 0.90 V, and 65.5%, respectively. The electron mobility of PDBT-T1:molecule 7.7a blends was estimated to be 3.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was relatively high and balanced with the hole mobility (μh/μe = 2.3). It is the high and balanced carrier mobility that accounts for the outstanding device performance. When molecule 7.7a was blended with a selenium-containing polymer donor, PBDTS-Se, a higher PCE of 8.22%, with a Jsc of 12.90 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.91 V, and FF of 70.0% was achieved.139 When the S atom of molecule 7.7a was replaced by Se atom (as shown in Fig. 7), a higher PCE of 8.47% can be achieved with Jsc of 12.75 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.91 V, and FF of 73.1% in devices based on the PDBT-T1:molecule 7.7b blend.140 Notably, the value of FF was unprecedentedly high in polymer-nonfullerene BHJ OSCs. The hole mobility and electron mobility were 3.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.8 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The better performance of molecule 7.7b than molecule 7.7a can be ascribed to more balanced charge mobility and higher FF. Unlike conditions in molecule 7.5c, molecule 7.7b showed improved interactions between Se–Se atoms compared to that in molecule 7.7a, because the selenium atom has a bigger outermost electron cloud than sulfur. Thus, molecule 7.7b exhibited enhanced charge carrier mobility. Dong Meng et al. synthesized two novel acceptors, molecules 7.8 and 7.9 (in Fig. 7).141 They displayed a twisted three-bladed propeller configuration with a compact 3D network in which PDI moieties in one molecule had strong π–π intermolecular interactions with PDI moieties in neighbouring molecules. Molecule 7.9 showed a more compact network due to Se–O interactions and it was arranged in a slipped 3D stacking structure. These compact 3D networks were favourable for electron transport. They showed high electron mobility in the blends paired with PDBT-T1, which was 1.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for molecule 7.8 and 2.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for molecule 7.9. In consequence, devices based on molecules 7.8 and 7.9 exhibited high PCE of 8.28% and 9.28%, respectively. Wei Fan and co-workers synthesized molecule 7.10 which integrated thiophene annulation in the bay region.142 The combined properties of appropriate LUMO levels, balanced carrier mobility and favourable phase separation
in the BHJ films make the organic solar cell based on acceptor 7.10 show a much higher PCE of 6.2% in comparison with acceptor 4.5a based solar cells with PCE of 3.6%, which is mainly due to higher Jsc and FF as listed in Table 1. Shuixing Li and co-workers designed and synthesized molecule 7.11 with a fully fused backbone in which two PDI units were fused with an indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) core.143 Owing to the electron-donating property of IDTT, molecule 7.11 exhibited high-lying LUMO levels of −3.75 eV and higher HOMO levels of −5.48 eV. The high-lying LUMO levels helped generation of high Voc. The fused and rigid backbone of molecule 7.11 facilitated electron transport. The electron mobility was estimated to be 3.66 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 in PTB7-Th:molecule 7.11 blend film with addition of 2% CN. A PCE of 7.33% was achieved based on molecule 7.11 with Jsc of 13.24 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.99 V, and FF of 56%.
6. Conclusion
In conclusion, the photoelectric and physical properties of PDI derivatives modified via the bay position vary with different substituents.
Recent advances in the subfield of non-fullerene acceptors based on PDIs strongly indicate that the organic n-type molecules have potential for replacing traditional fullerene acceptors. These acceptors are expected to exhibit superior optical properties, better electrical performance, higher efficiencies, and stability than traditional fullerene-based organic solar cells. Modulation of photoelectric properties and control of aggregation are the essence of designing new electron acceptors based on PDIs. (1) Molecular geometry. The twisted molecule configuration prevents the formation of oversized acceptor domains and large phase separation which are unfavourable for exciton diffusion. While excessive extent of twisting would hurt the charge mobility, great attention should be paid to keep the balance between the packing behaviour of PDI units and the twisted molecular configuration. Enhanced packing order helps to increase the electron mobility. Besides, PDI molecules should not pack too tightly which usually results in rapid excimer formation, while a slip-stacked motif helps suppress excimer formation without severely lowered electron mobility. Additionally, the interaction between acceptors and polymer donors is also vital. Modest interaction is necessary for charge transfer, because too strong interaction facilitates formation of trapped states and it is unfavourable for charge separation. (2) Energy levels. The HOMO levels of PDI-based acceptors rise as the electron donating ability increases, and the LUMO levels are almost the same unless strong electron-withdrawing units are introduced. Since low LUMO offsets proved to be sufficient for charge separation, novel high efficiency acceptors with low energy loss are anticipated. (3) Light absorption. Generation of sufficient photoexcitons depends on strong light absorption complementary to polymer donors. Usually, PDI derivatives linked via bay positions exhibit strong absorption in the visible region of 400–600 nm and it can be extended by introducing electron-donating groups, such as BDT, TPA and oligothiophene units. Highly efficient acceptors with broad absorption band are still scarce.
To achieve high efficiency of devices based on PDI, it is necessary to modulate the photoelectric properties of PDI while maintaining relatively small aggregation size with optimized packing motifs by employing the methods demonstrated above. Constructing PDI dimers is the most used approach due to synthetic accessibility. It can be achieved by linking two PDI units with variable bridges via bay positions, imide positions or ortho positions. Constructing multidimensional PDIs enables multidimensional charge transport and separation. These molecules exhibit a compact configuration which is favourable for energy and charge transfer from a PDI moiety to another moiety in one molecule. The optical, electronic, morphological and photovoltaic properties of PDI dimers and multidimensional PDIs are closely related to the length, size, geometry, intrinsic photoelectric properties and substituting positions of linkage units. As for fused PDI molecules, the nature can be modulated by planarity, axis direction and the extent of π-extension. As efforts are made to judiciously design novel organic acceptors, more efforts should be devoted to explore new packing motifs of PDI in the solid state in the future. At the same time, much more efforts should be made to understand the relationships between the molecular structure, electronic properties, materials microstructure, and photoelectric performances further. Additionally, the performance of the OSCs based on non-fullerene acceptors can be further improved by selecting or designing suitable donor materials, developing appropriate film-processing methods, and engineering the interfaces between the photoactive layer and electrodes.
