    , Accepted 17th October 2014First published on 23rd October 2014AbstractMetal Co nanoparticle-imbedded ordered mesoporous carbon (Co-OMC) materials were synthesized by a facile low-temperature hydrothermal approach of making phenolic resin-F127 composites with various amounts of cobalt nitrate and their subsequent carbonization. The synthesized Co-OMCs possess a high BET surface area, uniform 2-D hexagonal ordered mesostructure and large pore volume, and the imbedded Co nanoparticles are homogeneously distributed with sizes of 2–5 nm. In comparison with the pristine OMC, the Co-OMCs exhibit a higher graphitization degree, which is beneficial for enhancing the electrical conductivity. The Co-OMCs were applied as counter electrode catalysts in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), revealing that the electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction is improved due to a synergistic catalytic effect between the OMC and an appropriate amount of Co nanoparticles, and the electrical conductivity was also enhanced. The DSSCs based on Co-OMC counter electrodes exhibit an optimum energy conversion efficiency of 7.02%, which is larger than that of the cell based on a pure OMC counter electrode (6.18%), and comparable to that of the cell with a Pt counter electrode (7.10%) under the same experimental conditions. The high energy conversion efficiency, low cost and simple fabrication process make the Co-OMC counter electrode promising as a potential replacement of the conventional Pt electrode in DSSCs.
1. Introduction
To meet the demand for environmentally friendly and safe energy, one of the most promising technologies is to convert solar energy directly into electricity using photovoltaic devices. The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) has the most potential as a candidate for a next-generation photovoltaic device and has been widely studied due to its low cost, easy fabrication and high power conversion efficiency.1–3 A typical DSSC consists of a dye-sensitized nanocrystalline titanium dioxide (TiO2) film, an electrolyte containing iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox couples, and a counter electrode. As one of the crucial components in a DSSC, the counter electrode (CE) collects electrons from the external circuit and catalyzes the reduction of triiodide ions for dye regeneration, which plays an important role in regulating the photovoltaic performance and stability of the DSSC. The platinized FTO (fluorine-doped tin oxide) conducting glass electrode is commonly used as the CE in a DSSC due to its good conductivity and excellent catalytic activity for the reduction of triiodide to iodide.4,5 However, the high cost of Pt and its limited reserves in nature greatly restrict the practical application of DSSCs, which has stimulated great efforts to seek low-cost and Pt-free CEs. For an efficient CE, good electrocatalytic activity for the redox couples (such as I−/I3−) and enhanced electrical conductivity for the transport of electrons are required. So far, a variety of materials including carbon materials,6–8 conducting polymers,9,10 inorganic metal carbides,11 sulfides12 and nitrides13,14 have been investigated as CE catalysts in DSSCs, though few alternatives with comparable electrocatalytic activities to the Pt CE in DSSCs are available. Thus it is still a challenge to develop low-cost and high-performance CE catalysts to replace the expensive Pt electrode in DSSCs.
Currently, many carbon materials such as carbon black, activated carbon, graphite, conductive carbon, carbon nanotubes, carbon fiber and fullerene have been proven to be good CE candidates with superior electrocatalytic activity and stability.15,16 Among them, very recently, ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs) have been specifically studied as efficient CE catalysts due to their structural regularity for fast infiltration of electrolyte, high surface area for enhancement of effective catalytic sites, good chemical stability and outstanding electrocatalytic activity.17–19 Especially, amorphous OMC with graphitic pore walls is a potentially efficient CE due to its enhanced electrical conductivity.20 However, the common preparation of graphitic mesoporous carbon is implemented by a high-temperature thermal treatment (∼2500 °C).21,22 This strategy not only increases energy consumption, but deteriorates the pore structure. In contrast, catalytic graphitization with the assistance of metal salts (Fe, Ni etc.) at lower temperatures (<1000 °C) has attracted great attention.23,24 Thus, the development of graphitic mesoporous carbon with controlled textural properties by a feasible approach may be desirable for a high-performance CE electrocatalyst.
On the other hand, the incorporation of different nanosized inorganic metal compounds with tunable sizes, morphologies, and catalytic functions into mesoporous carbons has created a new way for preparing highly catalytic CE materials for DSSCs.25,26 A series of transition-metal oxides, carbides and nitrides imbedded in mesoporous carbons have been prepared by an in situ soft-template approach, and exhibited high power conversion efficiencies surpassing the performance of the DSSC using the traditional Pt CE,11,26,27 suggesting a synergetic effect. However, to the best of our knowledge, little attention has been concerned on the composites of transition metal (Ni, Co, etc.) nanoparticles and nanoporous carbons as electrocatalysts in DSSCs.
Undoubtedly, composites of mesoporous carbons with embedded transition metal nanoparticles have been successfully fabricated through the hard-templating approach.28,29 Nevertheless, the multiple step process is time-consuming and complicated, and the product often displays a disordered carbon framework and lower porosity. Moreover, the obtained metal nanoparticles are less uniform in size, and often severely aggregated. Therefore, developing a more effective route to facilely synthesize graphitic ordered mesoporous carbon embedded with controllable and uniform metal nanoparticles may be highly useful for their CE application.
Herein, a series of cobalt-imbedded OMCs (Co-OMCs) were prepared by a soft-templating approach based on the direct self-assembly of phenolic resins with F127 in the presence of Co(NO3)2·6H2O, and applied as CEs for DSSCs. The small Co nanoparticles were embedded in the carbon matrices without causing blockage of the mesopores, simultaneously increasing the graphitization degree of the OMCs, and the protective layer from the OMCs could overcome corrosion problems in the electrolyte. The resulting Co-OMCs as composite CE catalysts simultaneously provided high electrical conductivity and improved electrocatalytic activity, exhibiting superior DSSC photovoltaic performance with a higher energy conversion efficiency of 7.02% than that of the cell using an OMC CE (6.18%), and which is comparable to that of the one with a Pt CE (7.10%) under the same experimental conditions.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Preparation of materials
Co-OMCs were synthesized by a slightly modified low-temperature autoclaving method.30 1.65 g of resorcinol and 2.5 g of F127 were dissolved in a mixture of 15 ml water and 15 ml ethanol, and stirred for 15 min until the solution turned colorless. 1, 2, or 4 g of Co(NO3)2·6H2O dissolved in 10 ml of a mixed solution of ethanol and water (volume ratio 1:1), together with 0.2 g of HCl (37 wt%), was added. After 1 h of stirring, 1.25 g of 37% formaldehyde solution was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was further vigorously stirred for another 1 h, and a homogeneous red solution was obtained, which was then transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 80 °C for 2 days. The resulting polymer was washed with ethanol and water, and dried in an oven at 60 °C for 12 h. Carbonization was carried out in a tubular furnace under an inert atmosphere (N2 flow) with a heating rate of 1 °C min−1, then keeping the temperature at 800 °C for 3 h. The final product was denoted as Co-OMC-x (x = 1, 2, 4), where x represents the added amount of cobalt nitrate. Ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) was also prepared under the same conditions without adding any cobalt nitrate.
2.2 Preparation of counter electrodes
The FTO transparent glass substrates (14 Ω □−1, Nippon Sheet Glass) were ultrasonically cleaned sequentially in detergent, acetone, ethanol and distilled water for 30 min, and then stored in ethanol before use. Co-OMC-x or OMC CE was prepared as follows: 130 mg of Co-OMC-x or OMC and 15 mg of PEG-2000 were ultrasonically dispersed in 3 ml of deionized water and then continuously kept magnetic stirring for 2 h. Subsequently, TiO2 colloid (20 mg, P25, Degussa) was dropped into the prepared pastes and stirred for 2 h continuously. Then the as-prepared slurry was scraped onto the FTO using the doctor blade method and dried at 100 °C overnight. A Pt CE was fabricated by conventional thermal decomposition of 30 mM H2PtCl6·6H2O solution spin-coated on the surface of the FTO at 400 °C for 30 min.
2.3 Fabrication of DSSCs
The TiO2 photoanode was prepared by a modified method.31,32 In brief, the FTO was immersed in 50 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, the 20 nm-sized TiO2 layer was coated onto the blocking layer using the doctor blade method and then sintered at 125 °C for 30 min in air, resulting in a TiO2 film with a thickness of ca. 6 μm. The 200 nm-sized TiO2 was then printed on the FTO and sintered at 450 °C for 30 min to obtain a light-scattering layer of ca. 3 μm in thickness. The double-layer TiO2 films were finally treated with TiCl4 aqueous solution, recalcined at 450 °C for 30 min and cooled to room temperature. For the dye-sensitized TiO2 film, the two layers of TiO2 films were immersed into a 0.3 mM N719 dye (Solaronix SA, Switzerland) ethanol solution at room temperature for one night. The DSSCs were composed of a photoanode electrode, a counter electrode and an electrolyte containing 0.05 M I2, 0.5 M LiI, 0.3 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazoliumiodide (DMPII), and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine with acetonitrile as the solvent. 50 μm thick scotch tape was used as the spacer between the two electrodes.
2.4 Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 Focus diffractometer, with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) at 40 mA and 40 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were performed on a JEOL JEM 2010 microscope at 200 kV. All samples subjected to TEM measurements were ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol and drop-casted onto copper grids covered with carbon film. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured on a Quantachrome NOVA 2000e sorption analyzer at 77 K. The samples were degassed in a vacuum at 200 °C overnight prior to the measurement. The specific surface area (SBET) was calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, the pore size distributions were derived from the adsorption branches of isotherms using the BJH method, and the total pore volumes (Vtotal) were estimated from the adsorbed amount at a relative pressure P/P0 of 0.980. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves were recorded on a TA SDT Q600 analyzer under a constant air flow of 100 ml min−1 with a heating rate of 10 K min−1. Raman spectroscopy was performed on a Renishaw-1000 Raman spectrometer.
2.5 Electrochemical measurements
All photocurrent density–voltage tests of the DSSCs were carried out under an illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5) from a solar simulator (Oriel Sol 2A, Newport), calibrated by a standard silicon solar cell (Oriel Instrument). The cell active area used for the J–V measurements was 0.20 cm2. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were conducted using the three-electrode system in acetonitrile solution containing 10 mM LiI, 1 mM I2 and 0.1 M LiClO4. The as-prepared electrode served as the working electrode, Pt/FTO as the auxiliary electrode and a Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode. The geometric area of the cells was 0.25 cm2 and they were investigated with a potential scanning range of −1.0 V to 1.5 V at a scanning rate of 50 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel measurements were conducted on a Zahner Zennium impedance analyzer using symmetric dummy cells. EIS was conducted at a −0.60 V bias with a frequency range of 100 kHz to 100 mHz. The amplitude of the sinusoidal AC modulation signal was 10 mV. Tafel polarization measurements were performed at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1.
3. Results and discussion
The composites of Co nanoparticle-embedded graphitic ordered mesoporous carbons were directly synthesized using resol as the carbon precursor, triblock copolymer F127 as the mesostructure template, and cobalt nitrate as the metal Co source. The synthesis strategy is illustrated in Scheme 1. Firstly, the soluble amphiphilic F127 produced well-formed surfactant micelles in an ethanol/water solution, serving as the structure directing agent. Then the EO units of F127 interacted with the hydroxyl groups of resorcinol and the [Co(H2O)6]2+ complexes via hydrogen bonding, forming [Co(H2O)6]2+ surrounded hexagonally arranged F127 micelles.33–35 Moreover, the polymerization between the formaldehyde and resorcinol in the acidic system produced the carbon precursor. By the hydrothermal treatment, the F127, [Co(H2O)6]2+ complexes, and resorcinol–formaldehyde resols assembled into composites of F127/Co2+/resorcinol–formaldehyde copolymer, in which the Co2+ was well distributed. Carbonization of the composites at 800 °C led to the removal of F127 and the reduction of Co2+ to Co as well as the catalytic graphitization of OMC. Finally the Co nanoparticle-embedded graphitic ordered mesoporous carbon was formed.

Fig. 1 shows both the small-angle and wide-angle XRD patterns of the Co-OMC and the OMC samples. The OMC displayed a sharp and intense diffraction peak at 0.78° (2θ), which can be indexed as the (100) reflection of an ordered 2-D hexagonal mesostructure.30,33 This single diffraction peak is also present for the Co-OMCs, though the intensity decreased with the increase of the cobalt amount, accompanied with a shift of the diffractions to 2θ = 0.90°. This indicates that the structural mesopore ordering gradually degenerates and the pore size decreases with the increase of the Co content, suggesting that an appropriate amount of Co is favorable to retain the ordered mesostructure in the Co-OMCs. As shown in Fig. 1b, OMC shows a typical broad diffraction peak at 23.04° (2θ), revealing the characteristics of amorphous carbon. However, as to Co-OMC-x, it is interesting that this diffraction peak moves to a larger 2θ with the increase of the Co content. Especially, an obvious diffraction peak at 2θ = 26.00° is displayed for Co-OMC-4 sample, which can be assigned to the (002) diffraction for typical graphite-like carbon. This demonstrates that there is a partial graphitization of the carbon in the Co-OMC-x samples, and the Co loading efficiently enhances the graphitization degree of the OMC.23 Furthermore, all the Co-OMCs display relatively weak diffraction peaks at 2θ = 44.22°, 51.52° and 75.85°, which can be indexed to the (111), (200) and (220) reflections of face-centered cubic cobalt (JCPDs card number 15-0806), suggesting well crystallized Co nanoparticles in the carbon matrix. The average crystallite size of cobalt was calculated by the Scherrer's equation (D = 0.89k/βcosθ) from the integral breadth β of the strongest and well-resolved reflection peak in the [111] crystallographic direction. The corresponding average crystallite sizes for Co-OMC-1, Co-OMC-2 and Co-OMC-4 were ca. 3.5, 4.2 and 25.6 nm. No diffractions concerning cobalt carbide or cobalt oxide were detected, suggesting that Co2+ was reduced to Co during carbonization at 800 °C under N2 atmosphere.

To further investigate the structure of the synthesized Co-OMC-x, TEM was carried out and is shown in Fig. 2. For the OMC, the typical stripe-like and honeycomb-like pore arrangements confirm its well-ordered hexagonal mesostructure.
 Fig. 2  TEM images of OMC (A and B), Co-OMC-1 (C and D), Co-OMC-2 (E and F), Co-OMC-4 (G and H) and embedded Co nanoparticles in Co-OMC-4 (I and J). 
Similar hexagonal mesostructures can also be clearly observed on the Co-OMC-1 and Co-OMC-2 samples, showing stripe-like channels with d-spacings of about 10.5 and 11.2 nm, respectively. The Co nanoparticles with sizes ranging from 2 to 5 nm are highly dispersed in the carbon network of Co-OMC-1 and Co-OMC-2 samples. It can be seen that some of the Co nanoparticles are homogeneously inserted into the mesopore walls and some are partially exposed in the mesopore channels. However, for the sample Co-OMC-4, the mesochannels are present in relatively low order with a partially wormhole-like pore system due to the excessive Co nanoparticles, and the size of the Co nanoparticles has increased to tens of nanometers, much larger than the average mesopore diameter of 4.18 nm. The measured lattice spacing d111 for Co in Co-OMC-4 was about 0.204 nm. It is suggested that the size of the Co nanoparticles is dependent on the Co2+ concentration. At low Co2+ concentration, the Co(H2O)62+ complex can homogeneously distribute into the copolymer through moderately interacting with the EO units of F127 and without interrupting the self-assembly process. Upon carbonization, the spatial confinement effect from the mesoporous carbon skeleton restricts the growth and aggregation of the cobalt nanoparticles, resulting in well dispersed and small-sized nanoparticles. However, a high Co2+ concentration not only weakens the hydrogen bonding between the EO units of F127 and the phenolic resin leading to low ordered OMC, but also contributes to aggregation of large Co nanoparticles. Thus, an appropriate precursor Co2+ concentration is crucial for the generation of an ordered mesoporous structure and well dispersed cobalt nanoparticles. On the other hand, graphitic carbon is obviously observed in the Co-OMC-x catalyst, in which the graphitization led to the formation of relatively large graphite crystallites with an interlayer spacing of ca. 0.354 nm and the percentage of graphitic domains exhibits an increasing trend with the increase of Co content. This demonstrates that the pore structures of Co-OMCs slightly change from good mesopore ordering to relatively poor ordering with an increase of the Co loading, accompanying the enhanced graphitization degree.
N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and the pore size distributions of Co-OMC-x and OMC are presented in Fig. 3, and the corresponding textural properties are summarized in Table 1. The OMC shows the typical type IV isotherm with a well-defined H1 type hysteresis loop, characteristic of a mesoporous structure.30 As for Co-OMC-1 and Co-OMC-2, the isotherms remain of a similar shape, suggesting the retaining of well-defined mesostructure after loading with a small amount of Co. While for Co-OMC-4, the isotherms changed with the reduced nitrogen uptake, accompanied with a H2 type hysteresis loop, suggesting the destruction of the ordered mesostructure due to the introduction of excessive Co nanoparticles into the carbon network. Correspondingly, the BJH pore size distributions of OMC, Co-OMC-1, Co-OMC-2 and Co-OMC-4 centered at 6.45, 5.83, 5.85 and 4.18 nm, respectively, exhibiting the tendency that a higher Co loading resulted in a smaller pore diameter. As seen from Table 1, with an increase of the Co content in Co-OMC-x, the BET surface area decreased from 719 to 417 m2 g−1, and the pore volume from 0.71 to 0.40 cm3 g−1, revealing that partial damage of the ordered mesostructure and blockage of the mesopores occurred with the increase of Co nanoparticles embedded in the carbon matrices. However, Co-OMC-1 and Co-OMC-2 with an appropriate amount of Co loading still possess large surface areas and pore volumes of 676–649 m2 g−1 and 0.65–0.50 cm3 g−1, respectively. The observed high surface area and appropriate pore size for Co-OMC-1 and Co-OMC-2 are of great significance for the reduction and diffusion of triiodide.18

To quantificationally analyze the content of Co nanoparticles in the Co-OMC-x composites, TG was performed in an air stream from 30 to 800 °C (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4a, the weight loss of samples below 200 °C is due to the dehydration reaction and the weight loss between 200 and 650 °C should be ascribed to the oxidation of Co and carbon. In the range of 200–650 °C, exothermic peaks (Fig. 4b) at 605, 618, 597 and 540 °C were observed for OMC, Co-OMC-1, Co-OMC-2 and Co-OMC-4, respectively, and are due to the oxidation of carbon in the air atmosphere. The shift of the carbon oxidation peak to a lower temperature suggests the thermal stability slightly decreased with the increase of Co loading. Meanwhile the exothermic shoulder peaks located at temperatures of 607, 582 and 523 °C belong to the oxidation of Co in Co-OMC-1, Co-OMC-2 and Co-OMC-4, respectively. The temperature of the exothermic shoulder peaks of Co is lower than that of carbon, indicating the Co nanoparticles are more easily oxidized into Co3O4 nanoparticles. The Co content (x%) is calculated by subtracting the oxygen content from the Co3O4 residue content according to eqn (1). (1)where m1 and m2 are the mass of the Co-OMC-x composites and residual Co3O4 nanoparticles, respectively. MCo and MCo3O4 are the molecular weight of Co and Co3O4, respectively. Since the mass percentage of residual Co3O4 is 2.7%, 4.1% and 5.9% for the Co-OMC-1, Co-OMC-2 and Co-OMC-4 composites, their calculated Co content is 2.0, 3.0, 4.3 wt%, respectively.

Raman spectroscopy is also a powerful tool to further study the structure of Co-OMC-x. As shown in Fig. 5, the Raman spectra of all samples show two broad peaks at about 1318 and 1591 cm−1, corresponding to the disordered carbons (D-band) and the graphitized carbons (G-band), respectively. It is well known that the relative intensity ratio of ID/IG is a measure of the graphitization degree.24,36 The corresponding ID/IG ratios of OMC, Co-OMC-1, Co-OMC-2 and Co-OMC-4 are 2.08, 2.00, 1.89 and 1.67, respectively, indicating the graphitization was enhanced in the presence of Co nanoparticles, and the graphitization degree indeed enhanced along with the increase of Co loading. Especially, Co-OMC-4 possesses fine graphite crystallites resulting from the large graphitization degree of the amorphous carbon.37 These features are consistent with the wide-angel XRD patterns (Fig. 1) and TEM images (Fig. 2).

With regard to the targeted application of the counter electrodes in DSSCs, the Co-OMC-x composites with high surface areas, ordered mesoporous channels and enhanced electrical conductivity were investigated. For comparison, the pristine OMC and pure Co particles (ca. 75 μm in size) were also examined as CEs. Fig. 6 shows the performance of the DSSCs using the different CEs, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters of these cells are listed in Table 2. It can be obviously seen that the power conversion efficiency (η) of the DSSCs based on the Co-OMC-1 (7.02%) and Co-OMC-2 (6.84%) electrodes is much higher than that of the cell using the pristine OMC (6.18%) CE. Meanwhile, the DSSC with the pristine Co CE gives a η of 0.87%, suggesting a certain catalytic activity of Co in the reduction of triiodide. Thus, the improvement of photovoltaic performance for the cells with Co-OMC-1 and Co-OMC-2 CEs can be attributed to the following aspects (Scheme 1). Firstly, the retained highly ordered mesoporous structure in Co-OMC-1 and Co-OMC-2 arising from the good self-assembly between the phenolic resin and F127 is beneficial for the fast diffusion of triiodide,19 increasing the reduction rate of I3− to I−. Secondly, the increased electrical conductivity can further improve the transportation capacity of the electrons back from the external circuit based on the enhanced graphitization degree after the modification of the Co nanoparticles. Finally, a suitable amount of Co nanoparticles embedded in the mesopores or pore walls may play a certain role in the catalytic reduction of triiodide.38 Notably, the DSSCs using the Co-OMC-1 and Co-OMC-2 electrodes even display comparable short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) and open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) values to those of the Pt electrode, indicating their excellent electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of triiodide ions. Particularly, the DSSC using the Co-OMC-1 electrode shows the optimized photovoltaic performance (Jsc = 17.98 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.709 V, FF = 0.55) with a maximum η of 7.02%, which is comparable to that of the conventional Pt electrode (7.10%) under the same experimental conditions. However, for the Co-OMC-4 sample, the excessive Co nanoparticles are embedded in the carbon framework, leading to damage of the ordered mesopore structure and a decrease of specific surface area. The unfavorable structure slows down the ion diffusion and reduces the available active sites, resulting in the relatively poor photovoltaic performance compared with that of the Co-OMC-1 and Co-OMC-2 electrodes, though the large-scale graphitic carbon increased the transportation rate of the electrons.

In fact, the triiodine reduction reaction on the electrocatalyst surface could be influenced by these crucial factors, such as electron transport, electrolyte diffusion and catalytically active site. The optimum catalytic activity should be built on a good balance between these factors. As revealed by the above XRD, TEM, nitrogen adsorption analysis and Raman spectra, it can be seen that, in comparison with the graphitic carbon, amorphous carbon possesses a larger amount of catalytic active sites or defective sites due to its amorphous structure, however, the amorphous structure commonly leads to poor electrical conductivity, thus decreasing the transportation rate of electrons. The amorphous carbon modified by the appropriate amount of Co nanoparticles can not only enhance the electrical conductivity arising from the improved graphitization, but also maintain abundant catalytic sites. Furthermore, the Co nanoparticles embedded in the carbon network provide additional catalytic sites to assist the OMC in the reduction of triiodide. Both the enhanced electrical conductivity and abundant catalytic sites make Co-OMC-1 and Co-OMC-2 achieve excellent electrocatalytic activities for triiodide reduction, thus resulting in the good performance of DSSCs based on the Co-OMC-1 and Co-OMC-2 CEs. Nevertheless, the introduction of excessive Co nanoparticles into the carbon framework leads to a remarkable decrease of defective sites and disordered mesoporous channels due to the emergence of the large-scale graphitic carbon.23 The significant decrease of defective sites and slow electrolyte diffusion cannot be compensated by the enhanced electrical conductivity, thus leading to the inferior catalytic activity of Co-OMC-4 and poor performance of the DSSC using the Co-OMC-4 CE.
To gain insight into the electrocatalytic activity of the various CEs for the reduction of triiodide, EIS was measured in a symmetric cell configuration consisting of two identical electrodes.17 The obtained Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 7 and the corresponding parameters are summarized in Table 2. In a typical Nyquist plot, the intercept on the real axis at high frequency around 100 kHz represents the series resistance (Rs), including both the sheet resistance of the FTO glass substrate and the contact resistance of the counter electrode.25 The semicircle in the high-frequency region arises from the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) and the corresponding constant phase angle element (CPE) at the electrode–electrolyte interface, while the beeline in the low-frequency range represents the Warburg diffusion resistance (Rdiff) of the I−/I3− redox couple in the electrolyte.39 The Rct, a direct measure of the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of an electrode, is well accepted to be low in high-efficiency DSSCs.26,40 Co-OMC-1 and Co-OMC-2 exhibit low charge transfer resistances of 10.10 and 12.36 Ω, respectively, which are lower than those of OMC (30.50 Ω), Co (405.61 Ω) and Pt (15.36 Ω), highlighting an excellent catalytic activity. The superior catalytic activity may confirm the advantages of the unique structures of Co-OMC-1 and Co-OMC-2 on the triiodide reduction. On one hand, a highly ordered mesoporous system provides a fast ion transport network and the appropriate graphitization degree is favorable for electron transportation. On the other hand, the synergistic effect between the highly dispersed Co nanoparticles and OMC can greatly lower the electron transfer resistance, resulting in a significant improvement of the catalytic activity. However, a large charge transfer resistance was observed in Co-OMC-4, suggesting a relatively lower catalytic activity for triiodide reduction. This poor property may be attributed to the collapse of the partial mesoporous channels and the reduction of defective sites as well as the aggregation of Co nanoparticles which caused the inferior catalytic activity and a large Rct. The EIS results are in good accordance with the photocurrent–voltage experiments.

Tafel polarization measurements were carried out to further study the interfacial charge-transfer properties on the electrode surface.41Fig. 8 shows the Tafel curves of the Co-OMC-x, OMC and Pt CEs. The exchange current density (J0) is an important parameter which is closely related to the catalytic activity of the catalyst, and it can be obtained from the intersection of the cathodic branch and the equilibrium potential line.11 The curves of Co-OMC-1 and Co-OMC-2 exhibit large exchange current densities which are higher than that of the pristine OMC CE, implying lower charge-transfer resistances at the electrolyte–electrode interface and superior catalytic activities for I3− reduction. Furthermore, the exchange current densities of the Co-OMC-1 and Co-OMC-2 CEs are slightly higher than that of the Pt CE, demonstrating that they can act as more highly efficient electrocatalysts than Pt. In contrast, Co-OMC-4 gives a low J0, indicating that it cannot perform as effectively as Co-OMC-1, Co-OMC-2 and Pt. Moreover, the J0 is also closely associated with the Rct value as displayed in eqn (2).25 (2)

The order of Rct obtained from eqn (2) is in good agreement with the EIS tests. On the other hand, Jlim is another important parameter which is determined by the diffusion properties of the redox couple and the CE catalysts according to eqn (3), (3)where R is the gas constant, D is the diffusion coefficient of the triiodide, l is the spacer thickness, and T, Rct, F and n have their usual meaning. The Jlim values of the Co-OMC-1 and Co-OMC-2 electrodes are larger than those of the Pt and OMC electrodes, which means larger diffusion coefficients due to the well-defined and beneficial mesostructure.42 The much lower Jlim of Co-OMC-4 compared to that of Co-OMC-1 and Co-OMC-2 further confirms that the relatively poor mesoporous structure destroyed the diffusion of electrolyte ions and the aggregation of Co nanoparticles weakened the synergistic catalytic activity.
CV is another important tool to examine the catalytic activity of a counter electrode for the reduction of triiodide. It is well known that the cathodic current density depends on the scan rate of CV measurement.43 In this work, CV curves of various counter electrodes were obtained at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 and are shown in Fig. 9. As for the Pt electrode, two pairs of redox peaks are clearly observed, in which the left pair in the low potential range corresponds to redox reaction 4 and the right pair in the high potential range corresponds to redox reaction 5.44 I3− + 2e ↔ 3I−(4) 3I2 + 2e ↔ 2I3−(5)
 Fig. 9  Cyclic voltammograms of various counter electrodes. 
Only one pair of redox peaks assigned to redox reaction 4 is observed for Co-OMC-x and OMC. Since the reduction process of triiodide ions in redox reaction 4 is the rate-determining step for electron transfer from the counter electrode to the electrolyte,45 it is necessary to investigate the reduction process of triiodide from the CV curves. It can be noted that the reduction peaks of Co-OMC-x and OMC are more negative than that of the Pt electrode, suggesting a more irreversible process for the triiodide reduction. Notably, the Co-OMC-x and OMC electrodes exhibit much higher background current densities compared with that of the Pt electrode, which mainly results from the double-layer capacitance on the electrode–electrolyte interface due to the effective diffusion and adsorption of I3− on the large surface area. This phenomenon may promote their electrocatalytic activity toward I3− reduction. Besides, compared to that of the pristine OMC electrode, the reduction peak current densities of Co-OMC-1 and Co-OMC-2 are slightly larger, implying their enhanced electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of triiodide. However, Co-OMC-4 displays a much smaller current density than Co-OMC-1 and Co-OMC-2, due to its higher graphitization degree that reduces the catalytic sites of amorphous carbon and its disordered mesoporous channels that are unfavorable to the electrolyte diffusion. On the basis of the aforementioned CV, EIS and Tafel results, the Co-OMC-1 and Co-OMC-2 CEs with corresponding Co contents of 2.0 and 3.0 wt% show an excellent catalytic activity toward I3− reduction, explaining the good photovoltaic performance of the cells.
4. Conclusions
Co-OMC-x composites were fabricated by a one-pot organic–organic self-assembly strategy of phenolic resin and F127 in the presence of cobalt nitrate followed by subsequent carbonization. Metal cobalt nanoparticles were homogenously imbedded in the carbon network, accompanying enhanced graphitization and a well-organized mesostructure. Based on the enhanced graphitization degree, high surface area, and highly oriented mesostructure of the Co-OMC-x counter electrodes, the Co-OMC-x DSSCs showed higher energy conversion efficiencies than the pristine OMC one. The optimized conversion efficiency of the cell with the Co-OMC-1 CE (7.02%) is even comparable to that of the one using the Pt counter electrode (7.10%). It is demonstrated that Co-OMC-x with an appropriate Co content can significantly improve the electrocatalytic activity of OMC, due to the synergistic catalytic effect and enhanced electroconductivity owing to the suitable graphitization degree. The present simple fabrication method of Co-OMC-x not only provides a novel and low-cost pathway to develop Pt-free counter electrode materials for the large-scale application of DSSCs, but can also be extended to the synthesis of other metal imbedded ordered mesoporous carbon materials as efficient counter electrode catalysts.
