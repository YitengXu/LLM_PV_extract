    , Accepted 24th October 2013First published on 25th October 2013AbstractA new method is developed to prepare RuO2 films through UVO treatment of solution-processed ruthenium(III) acetylacetonate (Ru(acac)3) without thermal annealing. By introducing RuO2 as an anode buffer layer, highly efficient polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been achieved. The resultant RuO2 layer exhibits high light transmittance in the visible range. Remarkable improvements in the short-circuit current density (Jsc) of the PSCs can be achieved upon the introduction of the RuO2 buffer layer. The PSCs with the RuO2 anode buffer layer demonstrate improved photovoltaic performance in comparison with the devices using poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as the anode buffer layer. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSCs based on P3HT:PCBM and P3HT:ICBA reaches as high as 4.19% and 7.07%, respectively. An even higher PCE of 7.45% is realized by adopting a new conjugated polymer, PBDTBDD, as the donor. The results demonstrate that RuO2 has great potential as a hole collection material for highly efficient PSCs.
1. Introduction
Since solution-processed bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) were reported in 1995,1 the performance of the PSCs have been improved gradually by designing new organic photovoltaic materials2–7 and the construction of new device architectures.8–12 Until now, the highest reported power conversion efficiency (PCE) for single-junction and tandem PSCs has reached 9.2%10 and 10.6%,11 respectively. In conventional PSCs, indium tin oxide (ITO) is the most commonly used transparent conducting electrode. The work function of ITO is about 4.7 eV, which can not form an ohmic contact with most donor materials when directly used as the anode in PSCs. Therefore, in order to flatten the ITO electrode and increase its work function for efficient hole collection, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is often utilized as the anode buffer layer, because it has the advantages of high optical transparency, an appropriate work function, commercial availability and solution processability.13,14 However, the acidic and hygroscopic nature of PEDOT:PSS is detrimental to the stability of PSCs.15–18 Since the acidic PEDOT:PSS can etch ITO and lead to indium diffusion into PEDOT:PSS, problems are thus caused with respect to morphology uniformity16,19–21 and chemistry stability.16,20,21 Therefore, in order to obtain efficient and stable PSCs, it is desirable to develop alternative interlayer materials to modify the anode for efficient hole collection.
Recent studies have suggested that the interfaces formed between the active layer and the electrode are closely related to the performance and stability of PSCs. Suitable interface materials could adjust the energetic barrier height between the active layer and the electrodes, and increase the selectivity of the corresponding electrode for collecting holes or electrons.22 In addition, the interface layer could improve the rectification ratio of the PSCs,23–26 and also plays an important role in the balancing of the hole and electron harvesting rates at both corresponding electrodes.27,28 Therefore, by choosing appropriate interfacial materials, the transportation and collection of one type of charge carrier (holes or electrons) can be enhanced, and the transportation of the other type of charge carrier (electrons or holes) can be suppressed.
Metal oxides have been demonstrated to be an attractive class of anode buffer layers instead of PEDOT:PSS. Most metal oxides have the advantages of environmental stability and high transparency, which make them suitable for anode modification. In earlier studies, most of the metal oxides were deposited by vacuum based techniques,29–33 which is incompatible with the solution-processing technique used for PSCs. In recent years, some solution-prepared metal oxides, such as MoO3,34–36 VOx,37,38 NiOx,39,40 CuOx41 and WO3,42 have been demonstrated for the application as the anode buffer layer in PSCs. However, thermal annealing at higher temperatures is required to obtain such metal oxides with ideal carrier mobility, which is not compatible with the polymer substrates used in flexible PSCs. Moreover, when the metal oxides are used as the interconnection layer in solution-processed tandem polymer solar cells, the process of thermal annealing would impose restrictions on material selection for the front sub-cell. Therefore, electrode modification layers fabricated by low temperature annealing or even without any thermal annealing are necessary for large-scale flexible and tandem polymer solar cells.
Ruthenium oxide (RuO2) is an attractive electrode material due to its high electrical conductivity and high work function of around 5.1 eV.43 Recently, RuO2 has been reported to be used as buffer layers in organic light emitting devices and polymer solar cells.44 However, the RuO2 in the reported literature is fabricated by magnetron sputtering, which is incompatible with the solution-processing technique used for PSCs. As reported in the literature, ruthenium(III) acetylacetonate (Ru(acac)3) has been employed as an exciton-blocking layer in double-heterostructure small-molecule solar cells.45 In this study, we developed a new method to fabricate the RuO2 anode buffer layer on an ITO electrode for PSCs through the UVO treatment of solution-processed alcohol-soluble Ru(acac)3 without thermal annealing. The resultant RuO2 layer exhibits high light transmittance in the visible range. The devices with the RuO2 anode buffer layer demonstrate improved photovoltaic performance in comparison with the devices using PEDOT:PSS as the anode buffer layer. High PCEs of 4.19% and 7.07% can be achieved for the PSCs based on P3HT:PCBM and P3HT:ICBA respectively, by introducing the RuO2 anode buffer layer. When a new conjugated polymer, PBDTBDD, is adopted as the donor material, an even higher PCE of 7.45% can be achieved.
2. Experimental section
ITO-coated glass with a sheet resistance of 10 Ω sq−1 was used as the anode. Ru(acac)3, purchased from Alfa Aesar, was used as a precursor to obtain RuO2. PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P VP AI 4083) was used as the anode buffer layer for the control device. (6,6)-Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) was purchased from Nano-C. Poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) was purchased from Rieke Metals. Indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA)6 and the polymer PBDTBDD, based on 1,3-bis(thiophen-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo-[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione,46 were synthesized according to the previously published procedures. The molecular structures of the materials involved are shown in Fig. 1.

PSCs with RuO2 as the anode buffer layer were fabricated, based on the photoactive layers of P3HT:PCBM, P3HT:ICBA and PBDTBDD:PCBM, respectively. The devices without an anode buffer layer and with PEDOT:PSS as the anode buffer layer were fabricated as control devices. In addition, to check the effect of UVO treatment on the performance of the Ru(acac)3 complex, we also fabricated control devices with the conventional architecture (ITO/Ru(acac)3/P3HT:PCBM/Ca/Al) and inverted architecture (ITO/Ru(acac)3/P3HT:PCBM/MoO3/Al), in which the pristine Ru(acac)3 was used as the anode and cathode buffer layer, respectively. In the device fabrication, the ITO glass substrate was sequentially ultrasonicated with detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol. The pre-cleaned ITO substrate was then treated under UV–ozone exposure for 15 min. The filtered aqueous solution of PEDOT:PSS was dropped onto the ITO substrate for spin coating. Then, the coated ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate was dried at 150 °C for 10 min. The RuO2 anode buffer layer was prepared by spin-coating a 2.0 wt% Ru(acac)3–isopropanol solution at 2000 rpm for 30 s on the ITO substrate, and then treated by UV–ozone for 10 min. For the control devices with untreated Ru(acac)3 as the buffer layer, the photoactive layer was directly spin-coated onto the pristine Ru(acac)3 film. The P3HT blend-based photoactive layers were fabricated by spin coating a mixed 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution of P3HT:PCBM or P3HT:ICBA (1:1 w/w, polymer concentration of 20 mg mL−1) on the modified ITO substrate, and then solvent-annealed in covered glass Petri dishes for around two hours. Afterwards, the films were baked at 150 °C for 10 min under N2. The thickness of the active layer was adjusted to 230 nm by controlling the rotation speed of the spin-coating. The PBDTBDD blend-based photoactive layers were fabricated by spin coating a mixed 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution of PBDTBDD:PCBM (1:1 w/w, polymer concentration of 12 mg mL−1) on the modified ITO substrate. Finally, 20 nm Ca and 100 nm Al were vacuum evaporated on top of the photoactive layer.
The device's current density–voltage (J–V) performance was measured in an N2-filled glove-box using a computer-controlled Keithley 236 Source Measure Unit (SMU) under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) using a xenon lamp-based solar simulator (from Newport Co., Ltd). Input photon to converted current efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed under an ambient atmosphere at room temperature using a Stanford Research System model SR830 DSP lock-in amplifier coupled with a WDG3 monochromator and a 500 W xenon lamp. The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell.
The transmittance spectra were recorded using a HP8453 UV-vis spectrometer. A LAMBDA 950 UV/vis/NIR spectrophotometer was used to measure the reflectance spectra of the devices. The chemical component of the buffer layer surface before and after UVO treatment was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS data were obtained through an ESCA Lab220i-XL electron spectrometer from VG Scientific under a base pressure of 3 × 10−9 mbar, and 300 W Al Kα was used as the X-ray radiation.
3. Results and discussion
The chemical component of the buffer layer before and after UVO treatment was analyzed by XPS. Fig. 2a shows the survey scan spectra of the samples, where the characteristic core level peaks of O 1s and C 1s can be clearly observed, and the Ru 3d peak partially overlaps with the C 1s peak. The difference between the two samples before and after UVO treatment in the survey scan is that there is no discernable signal in the range of 460–490 eV for the as-prepared Ru(acac)3, where the Ru 3p core level peak is expected; on the contrary, apparent Ru 3p core level peaks can be observed clearly for the sample after UVO treatment. Fig. 2b shows the Ru 3d spectrum after the background has been subtracted. Due to the partial overlap of the C 1s signal with the Ru 3d core level peak, the analysis of the Ru 3d spectra is quite complicated, and a set of four individual components were utilized to achieve a good fitting result. The two peaks with binding energies of 281.3 eV and 285.6 eV, for Ru 3d5/2 and Ru 3d3/2, respectively, correspond to Ru3+.47,48 The separation distance of the two peaks is 4.3 eV, which is very close to the spin separation of 4.2 eV induced by spin–orbit coupling reported previously.49,50 The C 1s core level peaks at 284.6 and 286.5 eV are ascribed to the C–C/C–H bond and C–O bond from the acetylacetonate ligands, respectively.51 The corresponding peak areas of these two types of C, the atomic ratios of C in the C–C/C–H and C–O bonds, is 1:1.5, which is consistent with the stoichiometric ratio calculated from the molecular structure of Ru(acac)3. The UVO treatment of Ru(acac)3 results in obvious changes for the overlapped peaks of Ru 3d and C 1s. The XPS spectrum of the C 1s–Ru 3d region is deconvoluted into six individual components, with binding energies at approximately 281.4 eV, 282.2 eV, 284.5 eV, 285.7 eV, 286.4 eV and 288.3 eV. The signal at 281.4 eV in the Ru 3d5/2 region and the peak at 285.7 eV in the Ru 3d3/2 region are assigned to Ru(III).48 The other two peaks at around 282.2 eV and 286.4 eV correspond to the non-metallic Ru(IV) oxides which have typical Ru 3d5/2 binding energies of 282.2 eV.52 The separation distance of the two peaks for each type of Ru is 4.2 eV, which is consistent with the expected value reported previously.49,50 The peaks for the Ru 3d5/2 spectra are used to analyze the surface chemical component. The Ru(III)/Ru(IV) ratio obtained from the deconvolution of the Ru 3d5/2 peak is around 1:2.4. The peaks located at 284.5 eV and 288.3 eV correspond to the C 1s core level related to the C–C/C–H and –CO bonds which exist in the fragments of acetylacetonate ligands, respectively.51,53,54 According to the changes of the Ru 3d and C 1s core level peaks, it can be inferred that most of Ru(acac)3 decomposed during the UVO treatment, and the main component of the buffer layer is RuO2 (Scheme 1).

Fig. 3a and b show the structure of the device with RuO2 as the hole transport layer (HTL), and the energy levels of the materials involved in the device, respectively. RuO2 has a work function of around 5.1 eV,43 which is a little lower than that of PEDOT:PSS (5.2 eV).29

The typical J–V curves of the PSCs are illustrated in Fig. 4a–c, and the performance parameters of these devices are summarized in Table 1. For the PSCs using P3HT:PCBM as the photoactive layer, device A without the buffer layer exhibits a PCE of 2.8%, with a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 8.57 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.57 V and a fill factor (FF) of 56.2%. The parameters are relatively low for the P3HT:PCBM-based PSCs, in which the low Voc can be attributed to the non-ohmic contact between the bare ITO anode and P3HT. However, upon the introduction of pristine Ru(acac)3 as the anode buffer layer, the performance of the control device B decreases significantly, especially the Voc, which decreases from 0.57 V to 0.34 V. For the BHJ PSCs with ohmic contacts, the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the acceptor determines the Voc of the cell. Therefore, from the decreased Voc, it can be inferred that the pristine Ru(acac)3 interlayer can not form an ohmic contact with P3HT, even worse than the bare ITO substrate. The electron collection ability of Ru(acac)3 is also examined using device C with the inverted architecture of ITO/Ru(acac)3/P3HT:PCBM/MoO3/Al. Device C shows even worse performance than device B, with a Jsc of 8.87 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.31 V and a PCE of only 0.98%. The poor performance of device C can be mainly attributed to the mismatch of the energy levels of Ru(acac)3 and PCBM, and the non-ohmic contact leads to the decrease in Voc. The use of the PEDOT:PSS buffer layer increases the PCE to 3.70%, with a Jsc of 9.23 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.62 V and a FF of 64.7%. The increased Voc and FF could be ascribed to the ohmic contact formed between the PEDOT:PSS and P3HT. By using RuO2 as the anode buffer layer instead of PEDOT:PSS, the Jsc was further increased to 10.45 mA cm−2, while the Voc and FF remain almost unchanged, resulting in a PCE as high as 4.19%. As the Voc of devices D and E are the same, it can be inferred that the RuO2 interlayer can form an ohmic contact with P3HT as is the case with PEDOT:PSS as the anode buffer layer. A similar trend is observed for the P3HT:ICBA-based PSCs. Device F without the buffer layer exhibits a low PCE of 4.49%, with a Jsc of 9.78 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.83 V and a FF of 55.3%. The PCE is increased to 7.07% for device H upon the introduction of the RuO2 buffer layer, with a Jsc of 11.78 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.86 V, and a FF of 69.8%. Similarly, the Voc of device H with the RuO2 buffer layer is identical to that of device G with the PEDOT:PSS buffer layer.

To further verify the hole collection ability of RuO2 for PSCs with different donor materials, PBDTBDD, a new conjugated polymer which demonstrates an outstanding quantum efficiency in the long wavelength range of 500–700 nm, is selected as the donor for the PSCs. Fig. 4c shows the typical J–V curves of the PBDTBDD:PCBM-based devices. From the parameters listed in Table 1, it can be concluded that the PBDTBDD-based PSCs show a higher current compared with P3HT-based PSCs, which can be ascribed to the broader absorption of PBDTBDD in the long wavelength range. The control device I without the buffer layer exhibits a relatively low Voc and FF of 0.79 V and 60.1%, respectively, leading to a PCE of only 5.41%. This can be mainly attributed to the HOMO level of PBDTBDD of 5.23 eV, which is much higher than the work function of the ITO anode (4.7 eV), resulting in a non-ohmic contact between the anode and PBDTBDD, thus increasing the loss in Voc. The work function of PEDOT:PSS is 5.2 eV, which is very close to the HOMO levels of PBDTBDD, therefore, the loss in Voc can be decreased through the formation of a nearly ohmic contact. A Voc as high as 0.87 V is achieved for device J, which has a PCE of 7.05%. When using RuO2 as the buffer layer, the Voc decreases slightly to 0.84 V. This may be due to the slightly lower work function of RuO2 at 5.1 eV, and the difference between the PBDTBDD HOMO level and the RuO2 work function, causing a decrease in Voc. On the other hand, a high Jsc of 12.66 mA cm−2 is achieved, leading to a higher PCE of 7.45% for device K.
The IPCE spectra of the devices are shown in Fig. 4d–f. For the PSCs based on the P3HT:PCBM or P3HT:ICBA systems, the height of the IPCE data follows the same trend with the Jsc of the devices for each blend system. The RuO2-modified devices show higher IPCE, which agrees well with the higher Jsc of the corresponding PSCs, and the IPCE curves exhibit similar light response characteristics in the visible range. However, it can be observed that the light response of the RuO2-modified device enhances relatively in comparison with that of the PEDOT:PSS-modified device in the wavelength range of around 400–600 nm. It is also worth noting that the IPCE curves of the PSCs based on the PBDTBDD:PCBM system show different features in the visible range. The IPCE spectra of PBDTBDD:PCBM-based devices without the buffer layer and with the RuO2 buffer layer show similar characteristics. A valley is observed for the RuO2-modified device in the wavelength range of 350–460 nm, and the valley bottom is located at around 400 nm. However, the device with the PEDOT:PSS buffer layer shows a completely different light response in the wavelength range of 350–600 nm. The valley deepens and wavelength range expands to 350–560 nm, and the valley bottom shifts to around 450 nm, indicating the deteriorated light response of the PSC in this wavelength range. The only difference between the two devices is the anode buffer layer, therefore, it can be inferred that using RuO2 instead of PEDOT:PSS can improve the light response of the devices in this wavelength range.
In order to investigate the reason for this phenomenon, we measured the reflectance spectra of the devices with PEDOT:PSS and the devices with the RuO2 anode buffer layer, as shown in Fig. 5a and S1, ESI.† For the PSCs based on the PBDTBDD:PCBM system, the PEDOT:PSS-modified device shows a strong reflection peak in the 360–560 nm range. In contrast, the main reflection peak of the RuO2-modified device shifts to the range of 350–460 nm, and the intensity of reflectance decreases significantly (Fig. 5a). In order to quantify the difference of absorption induced by using RuO2 instead of PEDOT:PSS, the additional absorption, Δα(λ), is calculated from the reflectance spectra of the two PSCs according to the equation Δα(λ) ≅ −(1/2d)ln(I′out(λ)/Iout(λ)),55 where the I′out(λ) is the intensity of the reflected light from the RuO2-modified device and Iout(λ) is the intensity of the reflected light from the PEDOT:PSS-modified device. In the visible range of 430–800 nm, Δα(λ) > 0 (Fig. 5b), indicating there is an additional absorption effect of RuO2 in comparison to PEDOT:PSS in this range. On the other hand, the value of Δα(λ) is negative in the range of 360–430, which corresponds to the valley observed in the IPCE curve of the RuO2-modified device. For the PSCs based on the P3HT system, the increased light response of the RuO2-modified devices could be attributed to the additional absorption in the wavelength range of around 430–600 nm (Fig. S1†). Therefore, it can be concluded that RuO2 can decrease the light reflectance in addition to acting as the hole collection layer, thereby improving the Jsc of the devices due to the increased absorption of light with wavelengths longer than 430 nm.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, highly efficient polymer solar cells have been achieved by introducing solution-processed RuO2 as the anode buffer layer. The RuO2 layer can be easily obtained from spin coating a Ru(acac)3 isopropanol solution, followed by UVO treatment in air without thermal annealing. The RuO2 layer shows high light transmittance. The high work function of RuO2 enables it to effectively collect holes. An ohmic contact can be formed through the introduction of the RuO2 layer, which facilitates the enhancement of the PCE of the device by reducing the separated charge recombination losses. The PSCs with the RuO2 buffer layer exhibit enhanced performance compared with the PEDOT:PSS-based PSCs, and the PCE of the PSCs using a new conjugated polymer, PBDTBDD, as the donor material can reach as high as 7.45%.
