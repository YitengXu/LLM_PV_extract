1. Introduction
Energy is important for human life, stimulating intensive efforts to achieve efficient energy conversion and utilization.1–4 The conversion of clean and renewable solar energy to electricity with solar cells is one of the promising technologies to address energy and environmental issues. Among the third generation of photovoltaic cell technologies, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have prompted intensive research and development due to their low cost, environmental friendliness, and flexibility.5–8
As schematically depicted in Fig. 1, when a DSSC is exposed to light, the photoexcitation of electrons in a dye sensitizer causes them to move from the ground state to the excited state. The photoelectrons are then injected into the conduction band (CB) of a semiconductor, usually TiO2. The electrons from the photoanode are transported across the transparent conducting oxide (TCO) to the external circuit and finally to the counter electrode (CE). At the same time, the sensitizer is resumed to the ground state by the electrons donated from the electrolyte (typically I3−/I−) and the oxidized electrolyte is reduced to the reductive state by the photoelectrons at the CE. A perovskite solar cell (PSC) has a similar work mechanism to a DSSC, except that the photoelectrons are excited from the valence band (VB) to the CB of the perovskite layer.5 A standard PSC consists of a TCO substrate, a photoanode, an electron transport layer (ETL), a perovskite sensitizer, a hole transport layer (HTL), and a CE. The injected electrons travel through the ETL and combine with the diffused holes through the HTL at the CE to complete the circuit.

The electrocatalytic activity and efficient charge transport are crucial for the performance of photovoltaic solar cells including DSSCs and PSCs. Carbon nanomaterials possess excellent electrical conductivity and tunable structures, leading to their wide applications in energy devices.9–14 Among them, graphene-based materials have emerged as promising alternative materials for solar cells.5–7,15–18 Graphene-based materials are well-suited for use as CEs in DSSCs due to their high surface area, low cost, and excellent electrical conductivity. Research has shown that the performance of DSSCs can be enhanced by carefully controlling the doping configurations, defects, or functional groups of graphene CEs.19–22 Additionally, graphene-based materials can be utilized as photoelectrodes to improve the dye loadings, interface area of the dye/electrolyte, and electrical conductivity at the semiconductor layer of DSSCs.23,24 Moreover, graphene-based materials are promising as electrodes and charge transport layers in PSCs, thanks to their low cost, high stability, non-toxicity, and remarkable optoelectronic properties.25,26
However, one of the major challenges for graphene used in solar cells is the tendency for graphene sheets to restack due to attractive forces, leading to the loss of active sites. To solve this issue, three-dimensional (3D) structured graphene with a curved non-planar shape and tailored hierarchical porosity has been developed.13,27–30 These 3D graphene architectures are defined as non-graphitic structures consisting of less than 10 layers of graphene, which retain almost all the excellent properties of graphene.27 Therefore, 3D graphene can avoid the restacking of graphene sheets to retain the exceptional properties of 2D graphene, making it ideal for practical applications.31–34 This feature article provides an overview of the significant roles of 3D graphene-based materials in various components of DSSCs and PSCs, with an emphasis on 3D graphene from carbon oxides via our alkali metal chemical approaches.
2. Synthesis chemistry of 3D graphene
Three main approaches have been developed for 3D synthesis: hydrothermal or chemical reduction from graphene oxide (GO), chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or on-site polymerization (OSP) from hydrocarbons, and alkali-metal-involved chemical reactions with inorganic carbon oxides (Fig. 2).27,31,35 The fabrication methods that use GO rely on the self-assembly of GO to form 3D graphene structures, while CVD methods involve the catalytic decomposition of hydrocarbons on 3D templates. On the other hand, alkali metal chemical approaches are based on the exothermic chemical reactions between gaseous carbon oxides (CO and CO2) and alkali metals/alkali metal oxides. These methods are cost-effective and appropriate for large-scale production.

2.1 GO chemistry
GO can be produced via Hummers’ method or modified Hummers’ method, in which graphite reacts with potassium permanganate (KMnO4) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) (eqn (1)).36 Although this method requires toxic and dangerous chemicals, it enables the bulk production of graphene. 3D graphene materials can be obtained by reducing GO through various techniques such as thermal, hydro/solvothermal, chemical, electrochemical, and photo reduction.27,37 The reduction of functional groups on GO decreases the inter-sheet repulsion force, leading to the formation of a 3D network via the interconnection between neighboring sheets in the suspension.27,36 Meanwhile, the elimination of functional groups also results in curvatures, wrinkles, disorders, and defects in the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets, which contribute to the porous structure of 3D graphene. KMnO4 + 3H2SO4 → K+ + MnO3+ + H3O+ + 3HSO4−(1)
In the thermal reduction process, annealing the preshaped and dried GO bulk precursor can cause thermal exfoliation and expansion, resulting in a 3D porous structure that is dependent on the annealing temperature, time, and atmosphere.36,38 In the hydrothermal reduction process, both the π–π interactions and the hydrogen bonds between the oxygen-containing functional groups play a role in forming an interconnected 3D framework, with heat-induced supercritical water serving as the reducing agent.27 Dispersed GO in high concentration (>2 mg ml−1) can be reduced through hydrothermal methods followed by freeze-drying to form a 3D self-assembled graphene aerogel.39 Furthermore, graphene hydrogels can be converted into graphene organogels by exchanging the solvent with anhydrous acetonitrile and inducing special self-assembly behaviors of the GO sheets with interior water.40 In the chemical reduction process, GO is subjected to selective deoxygenation at lower temperatures using reducing reagents (such as HI,41 HF,42 Na2S,43etc.). The self-assembly of the chemically reduced GO may occur due to hydrophobicity and π–π interactions between the sheets, with cross-linked covalent bonds formed between the reducing agents and GO sheets. Typically, a simultaneous chemical etching and reduction process using Fe2O3 microcubes as hard templates results in 3D crumpled graphene with many folds, wrinkles, and interconnected macroporous structures.41
2.2 Hydrocarbon chemistry
The integrated 3D structures of graphene with regulated macro- and microscopic 3D morphologies can be fabricated with hydrocarbons as precursors and 3D substrates as templates.27,31 A well-known bottom-up strategy is the CVD growth of graphene sheets on metallic substrates (such as Cu and Ni) from thermal decomposition of carbonaceous sources followed by the transfer process and chemical etching.44 The cracking of methane on nickel catalysts is moderately endothermic and occurs at temperatures above 819 K where ΔG0 is below zero, producing hydrogen and carbon (eqn (2)).34 CH4 → C + 2H2, ΔH (298 K) = 74.52 kJ mol−1(2)
The properties of CVD-obtained 3D graphene can be manipulated with different carbon sources, substrates, and reaction conditions such as temperature, time, and inlet gas compositions.27,31 Since 3D porous metal substrates can catalyze the formation of 3D graphene layers on their surface, Ni foams with various pore sizes are widely used as substrates for 3D graphene production.45,46 Similar approaches were also explored for the preparation of tubular-structured monolayer graphene networks using Cu foam as a catalyst and a template.47 3D porous metal oxide substrates are more versatile and cost-effective compared to metal templates for constructing graphene structures with tailored morphologies. These substrates are also more thermally stable and easier to recycle. For example, a 3D graphene nanomesh framework with sub-10 nm pore size was synthesized on a porous layered MgO template, followed by washing with hydrochloric acid.48 To introduce functional groups, MgO was replaced with porous Mg3(PO4)2, which effectively doped the phosphorus atom into the 3D graphene material.49 The functionality of the graphene can also be enhanced by edge-enhanced modification using nitrogen plasma etching.50 Furthermore, 3D graphene–carbon nanotube (CNT) hollow fibers were successfully fabricated with radially aligned CNTs (RACNTs) sheathed by a cylindrical graphene layer using a one-step CVD method with an anodized Al wire template. The size of the graphene hollow fiber and the length of the RACNTs can be tuned by controlling the anodization time and Al wire diameter.51
Processes utilizing gaseous or vaporized hydrocarbons can be difficult to control, limited in production, and unsafe. To address these challenges, the OSP of non-gaseous hydrocarbons has been examined as an alternative approach, namely, solid or liquid hydrocarbons are mixed with catalysts/templates and subjected to high-temperature carbonization and graphenization to obtain 3D graphene nanostructures.27,31 Various solid and liquid hydrocarbons have been explored for the 3D graphene synthesis.27 For example, waste plastics containing polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were demonstrated to convert to 3D graphene nanosheets with 1–2 graphene layers on a nickel mesh catalyst bed at 850 °C.52 Furthermore, metal salts are often used in OSP of solid hydrocarbons, because they can decompose into corresponding metal oxides or reduced metal particles to facilitate the reactions during annealing at high temperatures. The resulting small metal-particles work together with macroscopic templates to create hierarchical 3D graphene structures.27,53–55 In addition, template-free OSP of polymers using laser energy has also been employed to rapidly generate a graphene network at high temperatures. One example is the conversion of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) into laser-induced 3D graphene in an ambient atmosphere.56
2.3 New alkali metal chemistry
In 2013, our group reported a new chemical reaction for 3D graphene synthesis, called the MTU reaction (eqn (3)), in which Li2O reacts with CO to give 3D graphene and carbonate.57 This discovery represents a departure from traditional catalytic processes. Since then, we have expanded the scope of the MTU reaction to include new exothermic chemical reactions between gaseous carbon oxides (CO and CO2) and alkali metals or alkali metal oxides (Fig. 3). The aforementioned reaction has negative Gibbs free energy changes (ΔG) and enthalpy changes (ΔH) according to thermodynamic calculations, indicating their thermodynamic feasibility and exothermic nature, requiring less energy input (Fig. 3(a)).57 In the process, alkali metal carbonates are generated and serve as in situ templates to direct the formation of continuous 3D networks of graphene.27 This approach is particularly suitable for the controllable synthesis of finely microstructured 3D graphene materials, making it a promising technique for large-scale production of high-quality 3D graphene. Li2O(s) + 2CO (g) → C (s) + Li2CO3 (s)(3)

At the same operating temperature, the reaction between CO and Na2O (eqn (4)) resulted in more disordered carbon sheets compared to the reaction with Li2O (Fig. 3(c)).58 This is because Na2O is more chemically active than Li2O. Na2O(s) + 2CO (g) → C (s) + Na2CO3 (s)(4)
The reactions between alkali metals and carbon oxides lead to the formation of various 3D carbon nanomaterials under different conditions due to the high reactivity of the alkali metals. The reaction between Li and CO consists of two steps (eqn (3) and (5)), producing Li2O, Li2CO3 and C in the products.59,65 The morphology and properties of the resulting materials strongly depend on the temperature. Dense mesoporous carbon with a high packing density of 1.94 g cm−3 was achieved at 500 °C,65 while 3D mesoporous graphene with a wall thickness of 2 nm was obtained at 600 °C (Fig. 3(d)),59 which exhibited large surface area (625 m2 g−1) and medium conductivity (987.2 Ω sq−1) suitable for use in DSSCs. In the reaction between Na and CO (eqn (6)), metallic Na-embedded carbon walls were obtained due to the fast formation of the carbon walls during the violent reaction (Fig. 3(e)).60 Although the carbon walls were amorphous, the fabricated DSSCs exhibited a very high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.03% due to their ultrahigh electrical conductivity.60 The reaction between K and CO (eqn (7)) produces 3D graphene with thin graphene sheets (Fig. 3(f)).61,66 The obtained K+ intercalated 3D graphene demonstrated bifunctionality in DSSCs and PSCs with a PCE of 9.19% and 8.60%, respectively, attributed to their unique structure with hierarchical pores and high intrinsic conductivity.61 2Li (l) + CO (g) → C (s) + Li2O (s)(5) xNa (l) + yCO (g) → Na@Cn (s) + zNa2CO3 (s)(6) 2K (l) + 3CO (g) → 2C (s) + K2CO3 (s)(7)
The utilization of CO2 to produce valuable chemicals can reduce CO2 emissions and repurpose waste gas. Alkali-metal chemistry has emerged as a promising method for this purpose, taking advantage of the thermodynamics of reactions between CO2 and alkali metals, and the carbon etching effect of CO2, to form 3D-structured graphene materials.28 As shown in eqn (8), the reaction involves the use of 4 mol alkali metal and 3 mol CO2, producing 1 mol carbon and 2 mol metal carbonate. Namely, the process can convert 1/3 of CO2 to carbon. The newly formed graphene walls could be in situ oxidized by additional CO2 through the following reaction (eqn (9)), generating surface micropores. 4M (l) + 3CO2 (g) → C (s) + 2M2CO3 (s) (M = Li, Na, K)(8) CO2 (g) + C (s) → 2CO (g)(9)
The features of 3D graphene derived from CO2 are dependent on the reaction temperature and the type of alkali metal used. Various structures, such as cauliflower fungus-like graphene (CFG),62,67 crape-myrtle-flower-like graphene (CMFG),63 cabbage-coral-like 3D graphene,68,69 honeycomb-like graphene (3DHG),64 and meso/microporous framework of surface microporous graphene,70 can be obtained. The CFG was produced at 500–650 °C with Li and CO2, while the reaction of Na with CO2 yielded CMFG at 600 °C, and the 3DHG was formed via the reaction between K and CO2 at 550 °C (Fig. 3(g)–(i)). The CFG synthesized at 600 °C has a large surface area (450 m2 g−1) and medium conductivity (8.6 kΩ sq−1), demonstrating an excellent PCE of 8.07%.62 CMFG and 3DHG used as CEs in DSSCs also exhibited a high PCE of 10.09% and 8.25%, respectively, due to their high conductivity and excellent catalytic activity.63,64
The reaction conditions significantly influence the properties of the resulting products. These conditions include the size and activity of the alkali metal/alkali metal oxide particles, the type of inorganic carbon compound, annealing temperature, reaction time, and gas pressure. For example, when the size of Li2O particles decreased from 10 to 1 μm, the resulting honeycomb-like 3D graphene structure was transformed into flower-like microstructures.71 Increasing the annealing temperature and time generally enhances graphenization and reduces defectiveness, which efficiently leads to the formation and separation of 3D graphene products with coproducts. The dynamic change in the Na consumption rate and carbon formation rate with the reaction temperature also leads to different morphologies of 3D graphene.63,68 A short reaction time could result in a small primary particle size and thin graphene walls with high oxygen content and low graphenization degree. Gas pressure also affects the structure of 3D products by influencing the reaction rate and driving greater release of oxygen in the product.28
The alkali-metal chemistry-based reactions with CO2 and CO are advantageous for scaling up, as they are energy-efficient and can use abundant and inexpensive alkali metals such as Na (around US$3 per kg), K (around US$13 per kg), and Li (around US$80 per kg).27 These processes can use typical industrial batch reactors. Recyclable economic strategies for alkali metal carbonates could be developed to further minimize the cost of reactants.
3. Structures and properties of 3D graphene
The different types of 3D graphene structures can be categorized into two main groups: (1) macroscopic structures, with dimensions larger than 100 mm, such as 3D graphene foams, aerogels, sponges, films, fibers, and milispheres, and (2) microscopic structures, with dimensions smaller than 100 mm, found in powder form with nanometer or micrometer-scale 3D structures.27 These various 3D architectures exhibit diverse physical and chemical properties, such as large specific surface area, excellent electrical and thermal conductivity, high mechanical strength, and good chemical stability.27,35 These unique characteristics of 3D graphene and its derivatives make them potentially suitable for solar cell applications.
3.1 Surface area and pore distribution
The specific surface area (SSA) of a 3D graphene material is mainly determined by the thickness of the graphene sheets and the presence of nanosized (1–100 nm) inplane and interplane pores. The reported SSAs of 3D rGO architectures without activation treatment are mostly in the range of 200–600 m2 g−1 due to the layer stacking.27 However, the surface area of 3D rGO can be significantly increased by controllable reduction processes. For instance, hydrothermally reduced graphene organogels followed by solvent exchange exhibited a high SSA (1298 m2 g−1), which is 2.1 times that of graphene aerogels (613 m2 g−1).40 Moreover, 3D porous graphene made by laser beam reduction of GO with well-exfoliated sheets has a large SSA of 1520 m2 g−1.72
The surface areas of 3D graphene materials obtained from hydrocarbon conversion can be easily tuned by changing the reaction temperature, time, and flow rate of the inlet gases. The generation of nanopores during the hydrocarbon conversion process contributes to a larger surface area. For instance, the removal of organic materials and reduced nickel domains during the transformation created nanopores, resulting in OSP-derived graphene with an average pore size of 40–50 nm and a porous structure.54 Moreover, 3D graphene was produced with a large specific surface area of 1628 m2 g−1 and pore sizes of 3–5 nm templated by mesoporous Mg3(PO4)2 through activation of the sheets with KOH or CO2.49
The specific surface areas of 3D graphene materials derived from inorganic carbon via alkali metal chemical reactions are ranged from 100 to 2000 m2 g−1 depending on the reaction conditions.27 For example, 3D graphene derived from the K–CO reaction displays a much higher surface area (990–1200 m2 g−1).61,66 This may be due to the formation of thin graphene sheets resulting from the dynamic interaction between K2CO3 and C. Furthermore, most of the surface area of these 3D graphene materials is accessible when they are used as electrode materials. Typically, micropores originate from the space between graphene sheets or surface pores in situ etched by CO2, while mesopores are formed after the removal of metal oxides or carbonates.27 Additionally, aggregation of oxides or carbonates during synthesis can lead to the formation of macropores. For example, 6 nm pores were observed between stacked graphene sheets, while 40 nm pores were generated by removing Li2O and Li2CO3.65
3D graphene materials with large surface areas have shown strong adsorption capacities for reactants due to their ability to strongly interact with π electrons, making them useful for applications as electrodes or catalysts. It is well-known that the surface areas of micropores with diameters smaller than 2 nm are usually inaccessible to electrolyte ions due to slow ion diffusion. However, the surface areas contributed by the surface micropores in 3D graphene can be accessed by electrolyte ions due to a very short transfer distance for ions.68 On the other hand, the voids between the graphene sheets are large, open macropores ranging from sub-micrometers to several micrometers in size that do not contribute to the specific surface area but are crucial for the efficient storage and transfer of ions or molecules.
3.2 Electrical conductivity
In most synthesis processes, the reduction of GO is incomplete, leading to 3D rGO structures with low conductivities due to the presence of defects and oxygen-containing groups, which disrupt the sp2-hybridized carbon network.36 In contrast, a 3D graphene structure obtained through CVD exhibits a higher and more uniform electrical conductivity owing to its seamless network and high-quality graphene sheets. Even with many mesopores, the primary interconnected graphene skeleton in the CVD graphene material can maintain a remarkable electrical conductivity of 3000 S m−1.48 However, macroscopic graphene foams produced by OSP with nonintegrated templates often have a lower overall conductivity due to their relatively inferior graphene sheet quality and 3D integrity.27 For example, the 3D graphene nanofoam created from PVA, which consists of 4–5 layers of graphene, exhibited a sheet resistance of 600–700 Ω sq−1 measured using a 4-point probe.54
3D graphene materials, which were synthesized from carbon oxides (CO or CO2) via the alkali metal chemical reaction, exhibited high conductivities with sheet resistances of 0.4–8 kΩ sq−1.27 Furthermore, embedding metallic Na in the material greatly enhanced the electrical conductivity of the carbon shell to 2.73 × 104–5.24 × 104 S m−1, which was two orders of magnitude higher than that (200–300 S m−1) of other 3D graphene.60 This happened because the embedded Na dopant decreased the effective mass of π electrons in the carbon framework.
The continuous conductive network of 3D graphene provides fast electron transport, while the interconnected hierarchical porosity is favorable for ion transport.73 This results in a faster heterogeneous electron transfer rate than that of 3D porous carbon.74 Additionally, 3D graphene electrodes possess high mass loading and efficient charge transport pathways throughout the entire frameworks.13 The 3D cabbage-coral-like graphene contains abundant micropores incorporated in the surface layer of the graphene walls, with an average diameter of 1.6 nm, which benefits electrolyte ion transport.68 However, there is a trade-off between conductivity and active sites that must be carefully considered when synthesizing 3D graphene electrode materials for solar cells.48
3.3 Defects and functional groups
GO sheets have various oxygen functional groups. Namely, hydroxyl and epoxy groups are often present on the basal plane, while carboxy, carbonyl, phenol, lactone, and quinone groups are mostly located at the sheet edges.36 These oxygen functional groups are electrochemically active for reduction or oxidation reactions. Furthermore, defects, such as edge defects and lattice/topological defects, typically exist in the composing layers of 3D rGO prepared from the reduction and assembly of GO sheets, which can be identified by an intensity ratio of the D band to G band (ID/IG ratio) of 1–2 in Raman spectra.27 The etching–reduction process can further increase the edge defects of 3D crumpled graphene, thereby providing more sites for triiodide reduction.41
3D graphene from hydrocarbon precursors via a bottom-up approach at high reaction temperatures (∼1000 °C) possesses lower densities of defects and surface functional groups compared to 3D rGO, leading to cleaner and less defective surfaces and thus ultrahigh hydrophobicity. Furthermore, the metal template-free approach avoids the use of strong acids in the etching process that causes a significant number of defects into the graphene walls.48
3D graphene materials derived from CO/CO2via alkali metal chemical reactions were found to be generally defective with weak Raman peaks and ID/IG around 1 in most samples.27 When alkali metals were used in the synthesis process, a unique feature of the resulting 3D graphene was the retention of oxygen-bearing groups or oxygen dopants, which can provide active sites for electrochemical reactions.57
The flexible carbon backbone of graphene provides endless opportunities for modification and functionalization. Introducing heteroatoms (such as nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, or transitional metals) into both the basal plane and reactive edges of graphene can efficiently tune the electrochemical and catalytic properties of graphene.75,76 Various methods have been explored to dope 3D graphene, including annealing in ammonia,38,49 being treated in HNO3,55 hydrothermal treatment with urea42 or thiourea,77 and N2 plasma treatment.50 The electron-withdrawing or electron-donating effects and additional structural defects of dopants can alter the electronic properties of graphene. Furthermore, these dopants also affect the density of states near the Fermi energy level, significantly enhancing the conductivity of graphene-based materials.75,76 Heteroatom doping can also increase active sites on graphene by changing the spin density distribution and atomic charge distribution, remarkably increasing its catalytic activity.75,76
4. DSSC applications of 3D graphene
Graphene materials have been widely explored as active components in DSSCs. Their high electrical conductivity and large surface area allow them to be used as counter electrodes (CEs). Furthermore, the 3D graphene materials can also be exploited for photoanodes, because their interconnected pore structures and large surface area offer more dye anchoring sites and promote the diffusion of electrolytes and their excellent electrical conductivity enhances the transfer of photoelectrons. Thus, 3D graphene can significantly improve the overall performance and durability of DSSC devices.
4.1 3D graphene-based CEs
Counter electrodes (CEs) are crucial components in DSSCs, as they collect electrons from the external circuit, facilitate the reduction of the oxidized electrolytes, and reflect unabsorbed light back to the cell, thus regulating device performance. Although platinum is an excellent CE material, its high cost and lack of stability limit its application. Due to its limited presence in nature (37 ppb), platinum is one of the most expensive metals, costing around US$50 per gram.20 It can also undergo oxidation and dissolution in the iodide electrolytes to form PtI4, potentially causing short-circuit.20,78 To address this, various alternative 3D graphene-based materials have been explored for CEs in DSSCs, either directly as electrodes or hybridized with other metal-free or active metal composites, due to their large surface area, hierarchical pore structure, efficient charge mobility, and corrosion resistance. Table 1 provides a summary of representative 3D graphene-based CEs for DSSC applications, all of which are based on the iodide/triiodide redox couple. As shown in Fig. 4(a), numerous 3D graphene CEs exhibited better performance than the platinum CE, depending on their processing. Tuning conductivity and active sites in hybrid 3D graphene CEs enhanced their efficiency. Significantly, 3D graphene was synthesized from CO or CO2via our new alkali metal reactions performed with an excellent PCE of up to 11% (1.4 times higher than that of the Pt counterpart) due to high electrical conductivity, large surface area, and suitable functional groups/defects.60

4.1.1 3D graphene CEs
Compared with pristine graphene materials that possess poor catalytic activity,18 3D graphene showed much better electrocatalytic performance due to its unique structure. It was demonstrated that microscopic 3D graphene materials synthesized via the alkali metal chemical reactions exhibited excellent performance as CEs in DSSCs.57–59,61–64 Furthermore, we conducted a systematic analysis of these microscopic 3D graphene materials, establishing the relationships between their performance in DSSCs and their specific properties, such as surface area, conductivity, and oxygen group content (Fig. 4(b)–(d)).27 As shown in Fig. 4(b), the PCEs increased from 7.5% to 10.0% as the specific surface area increased, but beyond an area of about 800 m2 g−1, a negative effect on the PCE was observed. This is probably because the effective surface area of samples with rich micro pores is much smaller than that estimated by N2 adsorption–desorption. Furthermore, a sheet resistance exceeding 10 kΩ sq−1 dramatically decreased the PCE, suggesting that sufficient intrinsic conductivity is necessary for a high-performance CE in DSSCs (Fig. 4(c)). In addition, Fig. 4(d) shows a parabolic relationship between the PCE of DSSCs and the amount of oxygen in the 3D graphene CEs, revealing that a small amount of active C–O groups (<5%) can facilitate the redox reaction. However, the trade-off between conductivity and active sites must be carefully considered to achieve optimal performance.
DSSCs with CEs of 3D graphene materials, which were synthesized from the reduction of GO or hydrocarbon decomposition with the CVD approach, usually showed relatively low PCEs. Therefore, increasing the carrier concentration through chemical doping has been explored to improve the catalytic activity of these 3D graphene materials. As a common strategy, heteroatom-doping can induce positive charges near the dopants, which results in a reduced ionization energy and a lower charge transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface, allowing faster triiodide reduction. For example, nitrogen-doped holey graphene was developed with nitrogen plasma, increasing the reducibility for I3− for DSSCs and thus improving the PCE.50 This is because the N-doping created topological defects, pyrrolic nitrogen, and pyridinic nitrogen as new active sites. Similarly, doping P into 3D graphene nanosheets could also increase topological defects as catalytic sites and thus enhance the catalytic reduction of I3− to I−.49 Furthermore, co-doping of graphene with two appropriate elements were explored to lower the energy gap and increase the conductivity and chemical reactivity. For instance, a hydrothermal route was employed to fabricate N and S co-doped 3D-graphene networks (NS-GN).77 The DSSCs with the NS-GN CE exhibited a PCE of 9.40%, which is higher than the N-GN electrode (6.29%) and the S-GN electrode (8.75%).
4.1.2 3D graphene-based hybrid CEs
3D graphene has been combined with other carbon materials to develop hybrid CEs for DSSCs, such as 3D graphene–GO hybrids,46,79 3D graphene–carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrids,51,80,81 and 3D graphene-quantum dot hybrids.79,82,83 It was demonstrated that loading 6 wt% rGO sheets onto the surface of a CVD-derived 3D graphene network as a hybrid CE achieved a larger PCE (9.79%) than those achieved when loading rGO (7.78%) and 3D graphene network (8.06%).46 This enhancement was attributed to the continuous structure that provided the conductive channels for fast electron transport and the close contact at the interface area. Since carbon nanotubes (CNTs) could serve as electrical bridges to build fast electrical transfer networks, they were combined with 3D graphene as the 3D graphene-modified CNT fiber DSSC CE, exhibiting a PCE of 6.8%, which is higher than those of the graphene CE (0.63%) and CNT CE (1.14%).51 Similarly, the introduction of single-walled CNTs into 3D rGO as a DSSC CE increased its PCE from 7.25 to 9.24%, because the larger surface area and good surface hydrophilicity increased electrolyte–electrode interactions and electrolyte/reactant diffusion that facilitate the reduction of I3− to I− in the redox couple.80,81
Moreover, carbon quantum dots were introduced into 3D graphene to develop hybrid CEs for DSSCs. It was found that the hybrid CE comprising the laser-reduced graphene quantum dots (L-GQDs) and CVD-generated 3D graphene foam exhibited a comparable PCE of 7.70% to that (7.68%) of the traditional Pt CE.79 The L-GQDs supplied additional active defective sites at the available edges for the reduction of I3−. Similarly, 3D holey graphene oxide nanosheets were modified by N-doped GQDs, resulting in a higher PCE of 9.1% than that (6.7%) without GQD modification.83 The enhanced performance was attributed to both fast electrolyte diffusion and an improved charge transfer interface via the unobstructed channels of 3D graphene, as well as the more effective surface reactivity sites provided by N-doped GQDs. Furthermore, graphitic carbon nitride quantum dots (g-C3N4 QDs) possess high catalytic activity and outstanding chemical/thermal stability but suffer from low conductivity. To overcome this limitation, porous g-C3N4 QDs were decorated on 3D graphene hybrid CEs, achieving an efficiency of 7.46%, which exceeded that of the cell with a 3D graphene CE (6.71%) and g-C3N4 CE (3.01%).82 The improved activity was attributed to the synergetic effects of the abundance of exposed sites and multiple pathways of charge and mass transport, based on the high intensity of the cathodic reduction peak current and a small charge transfer resistance of 13.5 Ω.
A conductive 3D graphene-based material is often utilized as a support for metal nanoparticles to prevent aggregation and deactivation of catalysts, as well as to enhance reactant transport and facilitate electron transfer to the electrode surface.86 The incorporation of heteroatoms and functional groups onto graphene can provide additional anchor sites for metal nanoparticles, promoting tri-iodide reduction activity and overall efficiency in DSSCs. For example, Co/N co-doped graphene nanomeshes synthesized using a CVD method and a MgO flake template displayed high electrocatalytic activity toward the reduction of I3−.84 Similar synergistic effects were observed in a 3D tremella-like mesoporous and Fe/N co-doped rGO hybrid CE.85 The metal oxide or metal sulfite nanoparticles were also combined with 3D graphene as hybrid CEs, because 3D graphene's porous framework can offer more anchor sites for the immobilizing metal compound nanoparticles, such as Fe3O4,87,88 MoS2,89–91 NixSy,92 and CoS.93 For example, the NixSy decorated 3D N-doped graphene materials exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction, resulting in a much larger PCE (7.72%) than those of bare NixSy (3.39%) and 3D N-doped graphene CEs (5.94%) (Fig. 5).92 Furthermore, the cell with hybrid CEs showed similar stability to that with Pt CEs over 4000 s under simulated AM 1.5G illumination due to the highly conductive network, highly interconnected porous frameworks, and well-aligned NixSy nanowalls (Fig. 5(c)). Recently, 3D graphene-supported multicomponent sulfide CEs have gained attention due to their ability to provide more alternatives and tune physicochemical properties by incorporating multiple cations, such as CoFeS2/rGO nanosheets43 and Cu2ZnSnS4/3D rGO.94

4.2 3D graphene-based photoanode
A photoanode in a DSSC is fabricated by sensitizing a semiconducting layer on a transparent conducting substrate with a dye. Graphene materials have been used as transparent conductors both in the semiconducting layer and as the sensitizer itself.18,23,24 Specifically, a highly reduced GO thin film can act as a transparent electrode to replace FTO at the photoanode due to its low sheet resistance (1.8 kΩ sq−1) and high transmittance (70.7% at a wavelength of 1000 nm).97 Although there have been limited reports on the use of 3D graphene as a photoanode, its unique microstructures and electronic properties suggest potential for use in semiconducting layers due to its: (1) large surface area for loading and dispersion of dye molecules, (2) hierarchical pores and functional groups that enlarge the interface area of the dye/electrolyte, (3) ability to address agglomeration and restacking of 2D graphene, (4) ability to act as a transportation layer for effective charge separation, and (5) ability to provide a barrier to minimize recombination losses of electrons from the semiconductor or from the current collector.
Various approaches have been explored to incorporate 3D graphene materials into a semiconductor (typically TiO2) to form composite photoanodes, including reduction of GO98–101 and CVD47,102–104 approaches. For example, it was demonstrated that the introduction of rGO into TiO2 in a photoelectrode increased the PCE by 55.3%.98 The promoting effect was attributed to the enhancement of electron transfer in the photoelectrode, which reduced the electron recombination. However, the promoting effect depended on the rGO content, i.e., as the rGO content increased in TiO2, the PCE increased to the maximum at 0.83 wt% rGO content and then decreased. This happened because graphene with a large content could absorb enough light to decrease the real light harvest of dye molecules. Similarly, a CVD-derived 3D graphene decorated TiO2 anode on plastic substrates exhibited a 56% PCE increase in a flexible DSSC.104
However, 3D graphene without surface functional groups would have a poor contact with TiO2, weakening the efficient electron transport at the interface. This has stimulated attempts to introduce functional groups into 3D graphene materials. For instance, the TiO2 anode decorated with 1 wt% rGO nanosheet-incorporated 3D graphene exhibited 16% larger PCE than the 3D graphene–TiO2 electrode without rGO, which was due to the enhancement in the photoinduced electron utilization ratio and the decrease in interface resistances between the graphene basal plane and TiO2 particles and between the photoanode and conductive substrate (Fig. 6).100 The O-functionalization of CVD-formed 3D graphene was demonstrated to increase N719 dye loading and enhance interfacial charge-transfer, leading to an improved performance.103

Another photoelectrode application is to use 3D graphene as a conductive scaffold for the in situ development of the MoS2 photoanode.105 In the approach, 3D rGO and MoS2 were hybridized as DSSC photoelectrodes via the hydrothermal process, achieving a high PCE (8.92%), which is much larger than that (3.31%) of bare MoS2. The superior performance of the DSSCs was due to the synergetic effects of 3D graphene with high absorption of dye molecules, rapid electron exchange with MoS2, and inhibition of the recombination of electron–hole pairs.
5. PSC applications of 3D graphene
Graphene-based materials are used in various components of PSCs, including electrodes, active layers, charge transport layers, and encapsulation layers.16,26 However, the use of increased graphene layers may lead to a reduction in electrode transmittance, making 3D graphene unsuitable for replacing TCO in PSCs.
Noble metals, typically Au or Ag, are commonly used as CEs in PSCs due to their appropriate work function and high conductivity, but their high cost and complex fabrication processes limit their practical applications.16,26 The unique structure and favorable electrochemical properties of 3D graphene meet the requirements of CEs for PSCs, indicating it as an ideal CE candidate with good chemical stability, well-matched work functions, and additional pathways for effective excited-state charge carriers and charge transport away from the PSCs. Additionally, the electron transport properties of 3D graphene make it an ideal ETL for PSCs.
The PCE values of 3D graphene-based PSCs range from approximately 8% to 17% (Table 2), which is lower than those of metal-based PSCs, but their low cost and flexibility are very promising for further development. The Voc of HTL-free PSCs with 3D graphene CEs is about 0.8 to 0.9 V, while it is found to be about 1.0 V to 1.2 V for HTL-based PSCs.7 This is because the elimination of the HTL uplifts the hole quasi-Fermi level in PSCs caused by the higher Fermi level of carbon materials than the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the HTL.7 However, removing the HTL can reduce material use and fabrication costs and enhance cell stability.

5.1 3D graphene-based CEs
Moisture can degrade perovskite and reduce electrode conductivity in PSCs, while ion diffusion and halide ion migration can also impair device stability.112 Graphene could act as a barrier to improve device stability by inhibiting the penetration of water and oxygen and suppressing perovskite component migration. For example, the PSC devices with graphene-modified CEs maintained 95% of their initial efficiencies after 5000 hours of tracking under continuous 1 sun illumination.113 Furthermore, the hydrophobic and chemically inert nature of 3D graphene CEs could also play a role in preventing moisture from entering the perovskite layer, contributing to superior stability in humid environments. Some of the PSCs with the conventional CEs suffer from an issue that the J–V curve measured from the reverse bias voltage had better performance than the J–V curve measured from the forward bias voltage. This happened because of either charge traps in low-quality perovskite films or the migration of methylammonium (CH3NH3+), iodide (I−), and photogenerated ions, thus reducing the stability of the device. However, such a hysteresis was not observed for the PSCs with the 3D graphene CEs, which were synthesized from CO/CO2via alkali metal chemical reactions.59,106–108 This indicates the high stability of the PSCs with the 3D graphene CEs.
The high work function effect of 3D graphene could promote band energy alignment, enhancing charge separation. For example, PSC devices with waste plastic derived 3D graphene nanosheets (GNs) have shown a superior PCE performance of 12.40% compared to that (11.04%) with carbon CEs.52 The band gap (0.5 eV) of the 3D GNs is a very close to the evaluated band gap (0.6 eV), indicating that 3D GNs are perfectly suited for CEs with the enhanced electrode conductivity and the reduced recombination losses.
The built-in electric field can facilitate carrier migration by increasing the difference in work function between the 3D graphene CEs and the perovskite layer. Indeed, 3D honeycomb-like graphene (3DHG) enhanced the separation of photogenerated carriers and inhibited interfacial charge recombination, resulting in an excellent PCE of 10.06%.106 The built-in potential of the 3DHG, which was extrapolated using the intercept of the linear regime with the x-axis of the Mott–Schottky plot, is equal to 0.98 V, which confirmed the generation of a Schottky barrier at the interface with the perovskite layer.
However, worse interfacial contact and higher sheet resistance than those of metals can be challenges for 3D graphene CEs. To improve contact, the 3D graphene should possess a continuous carbon structure that can be partially inserted into the perovskite layer.61,106–108 Furthermore, the addition of 3D graphene additives can passivate surface/interfacial defects and promote uniform perovskite crystal growth through bonding of their functionalities to uncoordinated ions on the perovskite surface, leading to more efficient charge extraction and suppressed charge recombination. The incorporation of the Na-embedded carbon nanowalls and the mesochannel carbon nanowalls (MCN) into the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer for PSCs increased the PCE by 71% and 121%, respectively, which outperformed the chemical-exfoliated-graphene-based devices.107,108 As shown in Fig. 7, the inserted MCN bridge plays an efficient role in decreasing the contact resistance and increasing the fill factor by about 100%. However, the chemical-exfoliated-graphene bridge was inefficient for that.107 This indicates that a suitable morphology is also important to ensure efficient perovskite precursor infiltration and sufficient contact of 3D graphene with the neighboring materials. The CO/CO2-derived 3D graphene with large surface areas and a high porosity facilitated the effective extraction and transportation of the photogenerated charge carriers with minimum recombination.

5.2 3D graphene-based ETLs
In a PSC, the role of an ETL is to facilitate the extraction and transportation of generated electrons from the perovskite active layer. One of the key functions of an ETL is to reduce interfacial energy barriers between the electrodes and the perovskite active layer. To achieve this, the work function of the ETL should be slightly lower than the conduction band of the perovskite material. Additionally, an effective ETL must possess high electron mobility to ensure efficient transportation of electrons.26
The conventional ETLs in PSCs are n-type metal oxide semiconductors, particularly TiO2, due to their low cost, easy fabrication, and suitable energy levels. However, TiO2 has limitations in stability under UV illumination and slow electron diffusion rate, which has prompted the development of alternative ETLs with graphene. As a widely used approach, 3D graphene has been incorporated into TiO2 as an ETL to improve the semiconducting properties, device stability, and charge extraction. Namely, the perovskite solution anchored into the porous structure of 3D graphene to generate sufficient contact between the two and high electron transfer efficiency. Graphene-based interlayers composed of reduced graphene scaffolds alleviated energy-level gradients, reduced charge transport barriers, and passivated defects in heterostructures, resulting in high-quality perovskite crystals with large grains.109 Compared to devices with solely TiO2 (13.5%) and the combination of TiO2 and 2D graphene layers (15.3%), the use of reduced graphene scaffolds in ETLs resulted in a lower carrier recombination and a higher PCE (17.2%) (Fig. 8).

As an ETL alternative to TiO2, SnO2 has higher mobility, transparency, and suitable band alignment. As demonstrated by UV-visible analysis and time-resolved photoluminescence, incorporating a small amount (0.25 wt%) of 3D-structured crumpled GO into SnO2 decreased the band gap and enhanced electron extraction ability, leading to a higher PCE (10.86%) than that (8.91%) of the cell with a pristine SnO2 ETL.111 Furthermore, the 3D crumpled GO also improved PSC stability under a relative humidity of 50–60%.
3D graphene was also reported as the ETL for PSCs without incorporating a semiconductor, which not only extends the active area for charge carrier extraction but also reduces interfacial resistance via topologically delicate nanostructures.110 In this approach, 3D graphene with a unique three-bladed propeller nanostructure was prepared by coupling and fusing a central triptycene hub and helical graphene nanoribbons. When these 3D nanostructures of graphene were used as ETLs in PSCs, the spokes penetrated the perovskite layer to accept electrons, which were quickly delocalized over the entire surface of the graphene nanostructures for charge transport. As demonstrated, the larger the spoke in the nanostructures, the higher the PCE obtained, with the highest being 18.0%.
6. Conclusions and outlook
This feature article provides an overview of the progress in 3D graphene-based materials for DSSCs and PSCs, with an emphasis on efforts from our group. Three major strategies have been developed for the synthesis of 3D graphene materials: reduction of GO from graphite, decomposition of hydrocarbons via CVD, and 3D graphene from carbon oxides (CO or CO2) via alkali-metal chemical reactions.
3D graphene materials (i.e., rGO) from GO reduction are not well suitable for the counter electrodes of DSSCs, because the presence of too many defects and functional groups caused their low electrical conductivity. Furthermore, although CVD-derived 3D graphene materials possess high electrical conductivity, they are also inefficient as DSSC counter electrodes due to their lack of functional groups and defects. However, the combination of these two types of 3D graphene materials has been demonstrated as an efficient way to develop 3D graphene-based hybrid counter electrodes. This will promote more efforts to develop various types of hybrid 3D graphene materials for efficient DSSCs.
3D graphene materials, which were synthesized from carbon oxides (CO or CO2) via our new alkali metal chemical reactions, exhibited excellent performance as counter electrodes for DSSCs due to their high electrical conductivity and large surface area as well as their suitable levels of functional groups and defects. All those results were obtained with I3−/I− redox based electrolytes in DSSCs. However, I3−/I− redox couple-based DSSCs exhibited a limited Voc of 0.8 V owing to low positive redox potential. Recently, a high Voc of over 1 V was achieved using a copper redox couple electrolyte, leading to a high PCE of over 15%.114,115 As future research, we will explore our 3D graphene CEs for more efficient DSSCs with copper redox couple electrolytes.
The application of 3D graphene for DSSC photoelectrodes has been focused on rGO, revealing that a small amount of rGO in TiO2 could enhance the photoelectrode performance, but the high content of rGO caused a negative effect. In future research, 3D graphene synthesized from carbon oxides (CO or CO2) via alkali metal chemical reactions should be explored as photoelectrodes for DSSCs.
The performance of 3D graphene in PSCs is still inferior, which limits the commercialization of solar cells with graphene-based materials. The poor interfacial contacts between the perovskites and 3D graphene in the assembled film result in relatively high interfacial resistance and charge recombination, leading to insufficient efficiency. Although incorporating 3D graphene into the perovskite layer could increase interfacial contact, it may influence the perovskite film quality. Adding an interlayer to the 3D graphene electrode/perovskite interface may improve the work function, reduce the energy level mismatch, and increase the contact area. This would become a future research topic. Furthermore, it is necessary to take more efforts for evaluating the long-term durability of 3D graphene-based PSCs and their manufacturing costs.
Additionally, 3D graphene materials with higher flexibility and mechanical stability also have the potential to be applied as electrodes for flexible and wearable DSSCs and PSCs.
