    , Accepted 12th June 2012First published on 14th June 2012AbstractThieno[3,2-b]thienobis(silolothiophene), a new electron rich hexacyclic monomer has been synthesized and incorporated into three novel donor–acceptor low-bandgap polymers. By carefully choosing the acceptor co-monomer, the energy levels of the polymers could be modulated and high power conversion efficiencies of 5.52% were reached in OPV devices.
The development of organic photovoltaic cells has received a lot of attention during the last decade and performances of 10% have now been achieved.1,2 The design of new semiconducting materials has played a crucial role in this development and recent donor–acceptor polymers have little structural similarity with the well studied poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT).3 These polymers must be considered as not only photon absorbers in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells, but also with regard to future commercialization, ambient stability and solution processability, which are key criteria in design. Indacenodithiophene (IDT), a ladder type donor moiety has been successfully introduced into semiconducting polymers, which exhibited excellent hole mobilities in organic field effect transistors (OFET) and good photocurrent efficiencies in organic photovoltaic cells (OPV).4–7 We have demonstrated that the judicious choice of bridging atom can not only have an influence on the crystallinity and solubility, but also allows modulating the frontier energy levels.8 The introduction of silicon as a bridging atom between adjacent aromatic units has several beneficial effects besides increasing the effective conjugation length and reducing the conformational disorder. The tetravalent silicon offers the possibility to attach solubilising alkyl side chains, which allows tuning the solubility and processability of the polymer. Given the fact that a silicon-carbon bond is slightly longer than a carbon–carbon bond, the anti-bonding lobes located on the butadiene fragments adjacent to the silicon bridge are separated further from each other, which ultimately should lead to a reduction of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level.9 This reduction of the HOMO manifests as an increase in solar cell open circuit voltage and a potential increase in efficiency.
The substitution of the central benzene ring in the IDT unit with a less aromatic thieno[3,2-b]thiophene has been shown to promote the electron donating character of the monomer.10 Due to synthetic limitations, the hexacyclic thieno[3,2-b]thiophene based donor units reported so far are substituted with para-alkylated benzene rings, which can lead to undesirable nanoscale morphologies, causing low fill factors (FF) in OPV devices and limiting performance to 2.5%.10,11 Herein we report a high yielding and versatile synthetic route towards a new silicon bridged ladder type donor, thieno[3,2-b]thienobis (silolothiophene) (Si4T). The incorporation of silicon as a bridging atom should therefore not only have an effect on the frontier energy levels, but also allow introducing linear alkyl side chains onto the hexacyclic donor moiety.
The synthesis of Si4T and the corresponding polymers is shown in Scheme 1. The α-positions of commercially available 3,6-dibromothieno[3,2-b]thiophene (1) were iodated and via a selective Negishi coupling between 2 and (3-bromothiophen-2-yl)zinc bromide, the 3,6-dibromo-2,5-bis(3-bromothiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (3) could be assembled. In order to improve solubility of 3 and to minimize the possibility of side-reactions during the following synthetic steps, the free α-positions of 3 were lithiated and subsequently quenched with chlorotrimethylsilane to afford compound 4. The ring-closure was induced by lithiation of all four brominated positions on compound 4 and by slowly quenching the reaction with dichlorodioctylsilane. Single crystals of 5 were grown from an acetonitrile/diethyl ether mixture, and X-ray studies confirmed both the chemical structure and the planarity of the fused Si4T unit, the central C14Si4S4 unit being coplanar to within ca. 0.03 Å (Fig. 1).

In order to incorporate the new hexacyclic donor unit into low-bandgap polymers via Stille coupling, the trimethylsilane groups were cleaved with N-bromosuccinimide before compound 6 was stannylated. All three polymers were synthesized by microwave assisted Stille polycondensations by reacting one equivalent of distannylated monomer 7 with one equivalent of the corresponding dibrominated co-monomer (A). All polymers were purified by a series of Soxhlet extractions and were recovered as dark fibrous solids with high molecular weights (Table 1). Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S5 in the ESI) confirmed that all Si4T polymers are stable above 420 °C. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) did not show significant thermal transitions for any of the polymers (Fig. S6 in the ESI).

Density functional theoretical (DFT) studies predict the lowest lying HOMO energy level for the Si4T-TPD polymer and a homogenous distribution of both frontier energy levels along the polymer backbone (Fig. S8 in the ESI). The energy levels for Si4T-BT and Si4T-2FBT are calculated to be the same, with the HOMO in both cases delocalized over the polymer backbone, but the LUMO mainly localized on the BT and 2FBT units respectively (Fig. S7 and S9 in the ESI).
Polymer Si4T-BT was obtained by co-polymerizing monomer 7 with benzo[c] [1,2,5]thiadiazole (BT). The polymer has a very broad thin film absorption in the visible range extending from 400 up to 800 nm with two absorption bands, one with a maximum around 450 nm from the π–π* transition and a much stronger intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) absorption band with a maximum at 714 nm (Fig. 1). The ionisation potential of the polymers were measured as thin films by photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA). The measured HOMO energy level of Si4T-BT was around −5.0 eV. Replacement of the BT unit with thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) led to an 0.3 eV lower HOMO energy level in the Si4T-TPD polymer (Table 2). However, given the fact that TPD is a weaker acceptor than BT, the absorption spectra of Si4T-TPD were significantly blue shifted, both in solution and thin film and the bandgap was raised by 0.1 eV. In thin film, the absorption band of Si4T-TPD presents a more defined vibronic structure, than in solution, with two peak maxima at 615 nm and at 668 nm, respectively. In order to reduce the HOMO energy level of the Si4T polymers without compromising the bandgap, monomer 7 was co-polymerized with 5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (2FBT). Due to the electron withdrawing character of fluorine, both frontier energy levels should be similarly lowered and therefore the bandgap is expected to remain unaffected.12 The absorption spectrum of Si4T-2FBT in solution is nearly identical to that of Si4T-BT. In the solid state, however there are significant differences between the spectra of both polymers. The Si4T-2FBT spectrum is further red-shifted than the Si4T-BT spectrum, perhaps correlated to the higher number average molecular weight of Si4T-2FBT. The Si4T-BT absorption band shows some indication of a shoulder at lower wavelengths, whereas the absorption band of Si4T-2FBT presents a well defined shoulder feature at higher energies. We speculate that the more defined vibronic structure of the Si4T-2FBT absorption band is caused by a reduction of the rotational freedom between donor and acceptor units in the polymer backbone, due to favourable attractive interactions between the sulphur's lone pair electrons on the Si4T unit and the electronegative fluorine atoms on the adjacent BT moiety. This hypothesis is also supported by the quantum mechanical calculations, which suggest a dihedral angle of 3.87° between the Si4T and the BT unit and a slightly smaller angle of 2.87° in case of the Si4T-2FBT polymer. The barrier of planarization, defined as the difference between the energy of the planar (constraint) and the fully optimized structures, of Si4T-BT amounts to 0.23 kJ mol−1, which is nearly double the energy needed to planarize Si4T-2FBT (0.12 kJ mol−1).

The HOMO energy levels of Si4T-BT and Si4T-2FBT are both higher than the corresponding silaindacenodithiophene (SiIDT) polymers previously reported.13,14 The increase in HOMO energy level confirms that the incorporation of the more electron rich thieno[3,2-b]thiophene into the IDT unit significantly increases the electron rich character of the fused ring system. The absorption spectra of Si4T polymers are about 60–80 nm red shifted compared to SiIDT polymers. When blended with [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), Si4T-BT afforded a VOC of 0.67 V and a short-circuit current (JSC) of 9.67 mA cm−2 in OPV devices, which corresponds to a rather low photocurrent efficiency (PCE) of 2.79% (Table 3). The Si4T-TPD polymer has a much lower HOMO energy level, which translates into a higher VOC of 0.80 V (Fig. 2). However, a similar JSC value of 9.42 mA cm−2 and the moderate FF of 0.46 resulted in average device performances of 3.46%. The Si4T-2FBT polymer exhibited the best performance in OPV devices. The low HOMO energy level of the Si4T-2FBT polymer manifests as a large VOC of 0.77 V comparable to the Si4T-TPD polymer, but the JSC increased by nearly 70% to 14.07 mA cm−2 which led to high device efficiencies of 5.52%. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are shown in Fig. 2 and all three devices exhibit a broad response from 350 up to 750 nm for Si4T-TPD, up to 800 nm in the cases of Si4T-BT and Si4T-2FBT, respectively. However, the lower EQE response at higher wavelengths suggests that in the case of Si4T-BT and Si4T-TPD most of the current is generated by the PC71BM and not by polymer excitons. Si4T-2FBT is the only of the three polymers with an EQE above 40% between 600 and 750 nm, which therefore contributes significantly to the charge generation in the OPV device at higher wavelengths.

The surface morphologies of the polymer:PC71BM blends were studied by atomic force microscopy (Fig. S10 to S12 in the ESI). All blends form very smooth high quality films when spin-casted from o-dichlorobenzene. The three films are very homogenous with little apparent phase separation and low surface roughness. The Si4T-2FBT film is slightly rougher than the other films and contains small granular features. The formation of these granular domains might be favoured by the higher molecular weight component of the polymer, which tends to favour phase separation from the PC71BM.
In conclusion, we have synthesized a novel thieno[3,2-b]thiophene based ladder type donor monomer, whose fused and planar structure was determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The incorporation of silicon bridging atoms allowed the introduction of linear alkyl side chains onto the novel monomer and we synthesized three soluble and easily processable new donor–acceptor polymers. By judiciously choosing the acceptor monomer, we were able to adjust the polymer frontier energy levels, which lead to high VOC values and excellent PCE values of 5.52% in OPV devices.
