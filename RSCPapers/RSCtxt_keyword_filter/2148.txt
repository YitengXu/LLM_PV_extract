    , Accepted 11th December 2016First published on 12th December 2016AbstractIn high performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the electron transport layer (ETL) has overwhelmingly been dominated by compact titanium oxide (TiO2), which typically requires sintering at around 500 °C. Such a high-temperature sintering procedure prevents TiO2-based PSCs from matching well with plastic substrates and low-cost manufacturing. Here we report cerium oxide (CeOx, x = 1.87), that was prepared facilely through a simple sol–gel method at low temperature (∼150 °C), as an alternative to high-temperature sintering processed TiO2 in the regular architecture of PSCs. With a PCE of 14.32% from the involvement of an optimized CeOx ETL through adjusting the precursor solution, and a higher PCE of 17.04% through introducing a [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) interfacial layer between the CeOx ETL and the perovskite layer, the present work about CeOx-based PSCs renders low-temperature solution-processed CeOx an excellent ETL for high performance perovskite solar cells with improved stability.
Introduction
With their low cost, easy processing and high efficiency, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) represent one of the most promising photovoltaics for the future.1–3 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has soared from 3.8% to over 20% in recent years.1,2,4–10 Typically, a high-performance PSC has a perovskite absorber layer sandwiched between an electron transport layer (ETL) and a hole transport layer (HTL). Both the ETL and HTL facilitate the transportation of the photo-generated carriers produced in the perovskite absorber layer and prevent severe carrier recombination at the interfaces.11,12
Currently, titanium oxide (TiO2) is the most widely used ETL in the regular architecture of PSCs. The thin TiO2 compact layer, however, is typically manufactured using a high-temperature sintering process (∼500 °C).1,2,7,10 This should be envisaged as a drawback for TiO2 as, for example, it is incompatible with plastic substrates and it creates an increased cost for manufacturing PSCs. Recently, Petrozza et al. reported the use of low-temperature (<100 °C) solution-processed TiOx as an ETL in perovskite solar cells, with a PCE of up to 17.6%.13 However, TiO2-based solar cells suffer from reduced stability under UV light, which has been attributed to changes occurring in the compact TiO2 and/or mesoporous TiO2 layers.14,15 This intrinsic instability will prevent TiO2-based solar cells from having commercial applications. To overcome these problems, solution-processable metal oxides, such as ZnO, WOx, In2O3, and SnO2, have been employed as the ETL in PSCs. Liu et al. developed solution-processed ZnO nanoparticles as the ETL in PSCs, with a high PCE of 15.7%.16 Susceptible to reacting with acid and alkaline solutions, nevertheless, ZnO is known to be chemically unstable and detrimental to the long-term stability of PSCs. WOx and In2O3 have also been employed in PSCs, with relatively low PCEs of 8.99% and 13.01%, respectively.17,18 Recently, Ke et al. reported that solution-processed SnO2 was an excellent ETL material for efficient PSCs with a PCE of 17.21%,19 but the processing temperature, as high as 180 °C, is still higher than the upper processing temperature (typically 150 °C) for the commonly used polyethylene terephthalate (PET) flexible substrate.20 Therefore, it seems to be imperative to develop a novel ETL with low-temperature processing (≤150 °C) and improved stability.
Cerium oxide (CeOx) is considered as one of the most important rare-earth oxides, with a wide band gap, large dielectric constant, high ionic conductivity, high thermal and chemical stability, a lattice parameter matching with silicon, and the excellent ability to store and release oxygen.21–26 Because of its outstanding properties, CeOx is a promising material for various applications, such as high-temperature ceramics,27 catalysts,28 fuel cells,29,30 capacitor devices,31 UV blocking materials,32,33 and solar cells.34–36 To our knowledge, however, PSCs using CeOx as an ETL material have not been reported before. Here, we demonstrate that solution-processed CeOx (x = 1.87) can be prepared facilely using a simple sol–gel method at low temperature (150 °C), and can serve as the ETL in planar PSCs with high performance and enhanced stability. The best-performing planar PSC using a CeOx ETL has achieved a PCE of 14.32%, through optimizing the concentration of the precursor solution. A further improvement in the PCE, up to 17.04%, has been demonstrated through introducing a [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) interfacial layer between the CeOx ETL and the perovskite layer. Besides, CeOx-based devices exhibit superior stability under light soaking when compared to TiO2-based PSCs.
Experimental
Materials
Cerium(III) 2,4-pentanedionate hydrate (Ce(acac)3·xH2O) and PbI2 (99.9985%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75 wt% in isopropanol), chlorobenzene (99.8%), and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%) were received from Sigma-Aldrich. PC61BM was obtained from American Dye Source Inc. Lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide (Li-TFSI, 95%) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, 96%) were received from J&K Chemical Ltd. 2,2′,7,7′-Tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD, 99%) was purchased from Lumtec. Methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) was synthesized and purified following a previously reported method.2 All chemicals and reagents were used as received without any further purification.
Solar cell fabrication
Patterned FTO glass substrates were sequentially cleaned through sonication in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol, followed by UV-ozone treatment for 10 min. Then a CeOx ETL was formed through spin-coating onto the substrates. To prepare the CeOx film, cerium(III) 2,4-pentanedionate hydrate was dissolved in ethanol in varying concentrations, and then treated in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min to prepare a Ce(acac)3 precursor solution. The precursor solution was spin-coated on the FTO substrate at 4000 rpm for 30 s, and then heated at 80 °C for 10 min, followed by annealing at 150 °C for 15 min under air. Reference devices based on a TiO2 ETL were also fabricated for comparison. A TiO2 film was deposited on the FTO substrate through spin-coating 0.15 M titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) in 1-butanol at 4000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 125 °C for 10 min. This process was repeated three times. Then, the TiO2 film was annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. After cooling down to room temperature, the TiO2 film was immersed in 20 mM TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min, and then washed with deionized water and ethanol. Finally, the TiO2 compact film was sintered in air at 500 °C for 30 min. After cooling down to room temperature, a thin film (∼40 nm) of PC61BM was deposited on top of the ETL layer (CeOx or TiO2) through spin-coating a solution of PC61BM (20 mg mL−1) in chlorobenzene at 4000 rpm for 30 s. The perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 film was prepared using a two-step method. Firstly, a solution of 1 M PbI2 in DMF was spin-coated on top of the prepared substrates at 5000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 70 °C for 15 min. Secondly, the PbI2 film was converted to CH3NH3PbI3 using a gas–solid crystallization process with some modifications.37,38 The gas–solid crystallization process was carried out in a closed container, in which the FTO/ETL/PbI2 substrates were placed, with the PbI2 side facing down, at a constant height of around 2 inches against the CH3NH3I powder (∼50 mg). The container was placed in a vacuum oven at a vacuum degree of ∼133 Pa, and then heated at 150 °C for 2.5 h. After the CH3NH3PbI3 film was formed and then cooled down to room temperature, a spiro-OMeTAD solution (72.3 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene), with the addition of 17.5 μL of Li-TFSI solution (520 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile) and 28.8 μL of TBP, was then spin-coated on the perovskite film at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a 100 nm Ag electrode was deposited on top of the spiro-OMeTAD layer using thermal evaporation under a vacuum of 2 × 10−4 Pa.
Characterization
UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-2550 UV-vis spectrophotometer. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained from a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were performed on a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi instrument. An AlKα (1486.6 eV) X-ray was used as the excitation source for the XPS measurements. A He discharge lamp, emitting ultraviolet energy at 21.2 eV, was used as the excitation source for the UPS measurements. All UPS measurements were performed using standard procedures with a −5.0 V bias applied to the samples. The fluorescence spectra were recorded using a Hitachi F7000 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 510 nm. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken on a ZEISS SUPRA 55 scanning electron microscope. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were measured using a Keithley 2420 source-measure unit. The photocurrent was measured under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 using a Newport Oriel 92192 Solar Simulator. A standard silicon solar cell was used to calibrate the light intensity. The area of each device is ∼0.06 cm2 for all the photovoltaic devices discussed in this work. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a Newport Oriel QE/IPCE measurement kit. The light intensity was calibrated using a single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell as the reference.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a depicts the device structure of a planar perovskite solar cell employing a CeOx thin film as the ETL. The energy band diagram of the device is shown in Fig. 1b. The CeOx ETL was prepared through a simple sol–gel method, followed by an annealing process at 150 °C. The optical band gap and valence band maximum of CeOx were determined using UV-vis absorbance spectrometry and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). The UV-vis absorbance spectrum for the CeOx film is depicted in Fig. S1.† The direct band gap energy (Eg) for the CeOx film is determined through fitting the absorption data to the direct transition equation,39 (αhν)2 = A(hν − Eg), where α is the absorption coefficient, Eg is the direct band gap and A is a constant. The plot of (αhν)2versus hν is given in the inset of Fig. S1,† and the extrapolation of linear portions of the curve towards an absorption equal to zero gives Eg for direct transitions. Eg for the CeOx film is determined to be 3.5 eV, which is close to the reported value for a ceria thin film prepared using a sol–gel method.22 Fig. S2† shows the UPS spectrum for the CeOx film deposited on an FTO substrate. The valence band energy (EVB) for CeOx is estimated at −7.5 eV below vacuum level. From the observed optical band gap, the conduction band energy (ECB) is determined to be −4.0 eV, which is slightly lower than ECB for CH3NH3PbI3,2 indicating that CeOx can be used as a suitable ETL for perovskite solar cells.

To determine the composition of the as-prepared CeOx film, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out. The full XPS spectrum (Fig. S3†) shows the presence of Ce, O, C, Sn, and F. The peak for C originates from adventitious calibration carbon, and the peaks for Sn and F come from the FTO substrate. The Ce 3d core level XPS spectrum is complicated, owing to the hybridization of Ce 4f levels with O 2p orbitals.40 As shown in Fig. 2, the Ce 3d spectrum can be assigned to 3d3/2 spin–orbit states (labeled u) and 3d5/2 states (labeled v).41 For CeO2, a mixture of Ce 3d94f0 O 2p6, Ce 3d94f1 O 2p5, and Ce 3d94f9 O 2p4 are labeled as u′′′, u′′, and u and v′′′, v′′, and v for Ce 3d3/2 and Ce 3d5/2, respectively.36,41–43 For Ce2O3, the two final states of Ce3+, including Ce 3d94f1 O 2p6 and Ce 3d94f2 O 2p5, are labeled as u′′ and u0, and v and v0, corresponding to Ce 3d3/2 and Ce 3d5/2, respectively.36,41–43 Therefore, Ce4+ has been fixed with six peaks at 916.4 (u′′′), 905.7 (u′′), 900.6 (u), 897.7 (v′′′), 887.6 (v′′), and 882.4 (v). Ce3+ has been fixed with four peaks at 885.2 (u′′), 881.1 (u0), 903.2 (v), and 898.6 (v0).36,40–43 According to reported methods,36,44 the concentration of Ce3+ in the Ce 3d spectrum is estimated to be 0.44, so x in the obtained CeOx is 1.78.

The optical and photophysical properties of the CeOx films were investigated to determine the suitability of CeOx as an ETL in perovskite solar cells. Transmission spectra of the CeOx film (∼60 nm) on FTO substrates, as well as a compact TiO2 film (∼60 nm) of similar thickness on FTO substrates, are presented in Fig. 3a. Both films exhibit high transmittance in the visible range, from 400 to 800 nm. The high transmittance of the CeOx film makes it beneficial for use as an ETL, so that more photo-flux can reach the perovskite absorber layer to generate photocurrent. To illustrate the charge extraction efficiency of the CeOx film, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurements of perovskite films on CeOx and FTO were carried out. As shown in Fig. 3b, the perovskite film deposited on the FTO/CeOx substrate shows a much lower PL intensity than the film deposited on the FTO substrate, indicating that a CeOx ETL can effectively extract photoinduced electrons in the perovskite absorber layer.

The morphology of the CeOx ETL was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to understand the influence of the CeOx interfacial layer on device performance. The rough surface with large island-like CeOx grains, as shown in the top-view SEM image of CeOx film coated on an FTO substrate (Fig. 4a), is unfavorable for charge transport and efficient charge extraction. There are no distinct peaks in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the CeOx film (Fig. S4†), indicating that the low-temperature and solution-processed CeOx ETL was almost amorphous. To fully assess the CeOx ETL, planar perovskite solar cells with the configuration of FTO/CeOx/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag were fabricated. As illustrated in Fig. 4c, the as-formed CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films grown on CeOx substrates exhibit full surface coverage and micrometer-sized grains. The XRD pattern (Fig. S4†) also shows a fully formed perovskite structure. Fig. 4d shows SEM cross-section images of the as-fabricated solar cells with CeOx as the ETL. For the optimized device in this study, the thicknesses of the CeOx, perovskite layer, spiro-OMeTAD and Ag are about 60, 250, 150, and 100 nm, respectively.

The photovoltaic performances of the PSCs employing CeOx ETLs prepared at 150 °C were measured under AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination. The thickness of the ETL has a heavy influence on photovoltaic performance. So we optimized the thickness of the CeOx film through changing the concentration of the precursor solution; different precursor concentrations (0.005, 0.01, 0.02, and 0.05 M) were prepared through dissolving different amounts of cerium(III) 2,4-pentanedionate hydrate in ethanol. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the as-fabricated solar cells, depending on the CeOx ETLs, are shown in Fig. S5,† and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S1.† A device without a CeOx ETL was prepared for comparison, which exhibited an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.93 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 19.87 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 41.16%, resulting in a low PCE of 7.61%. Employing CeOx as the ETL substantially increased the PCE of the best device to 14.32% (Table S1†). It can be clearly concluded that the PCE first increases to a maximum and then decreases significantly as the precursor concentration increases. Further investigations reveal that both Voc and Jsc seem insusceptible to the concentration of the precursor solution, but the FF is subject to the concentration of the precursor solution (Table S1†). The optimum thickness for the CeOx ETL is about 60 nm, which is prepared using a 0.01 M cerium(III) 2,4-pentanedionate hydrate precursor solution. For comparison, devices using the most common TiO2 ETL were also fabricated, which displayed a best PCE of 15.03%, with a Voc of 1.03 V, a Jsc of 22.63 mA cm−2, and a FF of 64.48%. Although both TiO2- and CeOx-based PSCs have a similar Voc and Jsc, the FF of the TiO2-based device is slightly higher than that of the CeOx-based one.
To further enhance the efficiency of the perovskite solar cells, a thin layer of PC61BM was introduced between the CeOx ETL and the perovskite absorber layer. The introduction of a PC61BM interfacial modification layer between the TiO2 or ZnO ETL and perovskite absorber layer in regular device configurations has proven to be very effective in enhancing device performance.13,45–48 Therefore, we intended to modify the surface of the CeOx film through incorporating PC61BM for better electron transport/extraction. Fig. 4b shows the morphology of the PC61BM layer formed on the CeOx film as compact and uniform, expectedly facilitating an improvement in the performance of CeOx-based devices. Notably, the transmittance of CeOx/PC61BM is slightly higher than that of CeOx (Fig. 3a), which is similar to a previous report about the higher transmittance of TiOx/PC61BM compared with TiOx.13 The J–V curves of the best-performing PSCs, based on a CeOx ETL with and without PC61BM, are presented in Fig. 5a. For comparison, devices exclusively using a PC61BM layer were also fabricated, which displayed a low PCE of 10.44%, with a Voc of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 19.03 mA cm−2, and a FF of 59.63%. PSCs employing CeOx/PC61BM showed remarkably enhanced device performance, as compared with that of the pure CeOx devices, resulting in a best-performing PCE of 17.04%, with a Voc of 1.06 V, a Jsc of 23.25 mA cm−2, and a FF of 69.14%. The average photovoltaic parameters of PSCs using different ETLs for 10 cells are summarized in Table 1. The results show that the average PCE (13.77%) of PSCs based on a pure CeOx ETL is unsatisfactory and lower than that of reference devices based on a TiO2 ETL, which mainly results from the relatively low FF. After the introduction of a thin PC61BM layer between the CeOx ETL and the perovskite layer, the average FF increased to 69.62%, leading to an average PCE of 16.85%. The enhancement in device performance can be attributed to the incorporation of PC61BM with the CeOx ETL, which can significantly reduce trap-assisted charge recombination at the interfaces, as well as in the perovskite absorber layer, so as to increase the resultant FF.45 The best-performing device using a CeOx/PC61BM ETL also achieved a steady-state efficiency of 16.34%, with a steady-state current density of 19.52 mA cm−2 at a constant bias voltage of 0.837 V (Fig. 5c). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of the best-performing PSC, based on a CeOx/PC61BM ETL, is presented in Fig. 5b. For comparison, EQE spectra for devices with a PC61BM ETL and without an ETL are also given. The EQE value of the PSC with a CeOx/PC61BM ETL is higher than that of devices with a PC61BM ETL or without an ETL, which is consistent with the higher Jsc of devices based on a CeOx/PC61BM ETL. It is noted that the maximum EQE of PSCs with a CeOx/PC61BM ETL reaches over 90%, which is mainly due to the high charge extraction properties of CH3NH3PbI3, and in part due to light reflection from the back Ag electrode.49 It is well-known that perovskite solar cells, particularly those with a planar structure with TiO2 as the ETL, often exhibit significant hysteresis. In our work, the PSCs using CeOx as the ETL also exhibit hysteresis, which is strongly dependent on the scan rate and scan direction (Fig. S6a and b†). However, less hysteresis was observed (Fig. S6c and d†) after introducing a PC61BM layer, corroborating that PC61BM can effectively passivate traps at the ETL interface and reduce hysteresis.13,45–47

The stability of perovskite solar cells has become an increasingly important issue for their commercialization.50,51 It has been demonstrated that the formation of trap states and defects at the perovskite and TiO2 surfaces is one possible reason for the degradation of TiO2-based solar cells, when aged under full solar irradiation.14,15,50,51 The employment of a PC61BM buffer layer between the perovskite film and ETL is not only facilitated to prevent the perovskite film from direct contact with the ETL, but is also beneficial for device stability.47,48 We investigated the device stability of encapsulated perovskite solar cells based on CeOx and TiO2 ETLs with a PC61BM buffer layer under a light soaking test. It should be noted that the PCE of both devices enhanced significantly after 30 min of light soaking, which is consistent with previous reports.52–55 As shown in Fig. 6, CeOx-based devices retained 85% of their initial PCE after light soaking through continuously illuminating the devices under simulated full spectrum AM 1.5 illumination under ambient atmosphere at room temperature for about 300 min, whereas the TiO2-based control device decreased to 35% of its initial value under the same aging conditions.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully developed a simple solution-processed CeOx (x = 1.87) ETL at low temperature (∼150 °C) for high performance PSCs. Through introducing a thin layer of PC61BM between the CeOx film and the perovskite layer, the PCE of the CeOx-based PSCs can be increased up to 17.04%. Moreover, CeOx-based devices exhibit superior stability under light soaking compared to TiO2-based PSCs, which involve high-temperature processing (∼500 °C). Therefore, CeOx is a promising alternative to the currently prevalent TiO2 ETL for efficient and stable perovskite solar cells, and the low-temperature processing, which is compatible with flexible substrates, provides new opportunities for making future PSCs.
