In this paper, we present a new polytriarylamine derivative, poly[bis(4-phenyl)(4-methylphenyl)amine] (PTA), which showed significantly improved photovoltaic performance compared to dopant-free PTAA. Perovskite solar cells based on the PTA/MoO3 hybrid hole-transport layer (HTL) and MAPbI3 absorber delivered a competitive 17.0% efficiency, which is currently the highest value achieved for n–i–p perovskite solar cells using dopant-free polytriarylamine-type HTLs. The enhanced device performance was attributed to a better HOMO alignment of PTA (5.38 eV) vs. PTAA (5.27 eV) with respect to the perovskite valence band.
Introduction
The discovery of semiconductor materials based on complex lead halides with perovskite crystal lattices paved the way to a new generation of solar cells with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) reaching 24.2%.1 Lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are based on APbX3 absorbers with a perovskite crystal structure, where A is a univalent cation, usually methylammonium (MA), formamidinium (FA), or cesium (Cs+) or a mixture of these, while X is a halide anion or a composition of halides. Methylammonium iodoplumbate, MAPbI3,2 was under the spotlight first, followed by the state-of-the-art MA0.17FA0.83Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 (ref. 3) and mixed-cation CsxMAyFA1−x−yPb(I1−nBrn)3 (ref. 4 and 5) perovskite formulations, which led to either higher power conversion efficiency or improved operational stability of solar cells. Currently, the performances of PSCs are becoming competitive with those of the mainstream crystalline silicon solar cells, while low intrinsic stability of lead halide perovskites hampers the commercialization of perovskite PV technology.
In particular, numerous studies showed that lead halide perovskites are not only sensitive to atmospheric oxygen and moisture but they also, more importantly, degrade at elevated temperatures or under exposure to light even in an inert atmosphere.6,7 However, major progress has been achieved in stabilization of perovskite solar cells through a proper choice of the adjacent charge transport layers. Interface engineering allowed several groups to independently achieve impressive lifetimes of >1000 h for PSCs under continuous illumination.8,9
The interface between the perovskite layer and the hole-transport material (HTM) in a regular n–i–p device architecture is currently the main limitation for the development of stable perovskite solar cells. Most commonly used organic HTMs such as polytriarylamines or spiro-OMeTAD do not have sufficiently high charge carrier mobilities and thus need to be doped in order to achieve good device performances.10
While a considerable effort has been made to identify suitable dopants that do not affect the stability of PSCs,11 a straightforward strategy would be to employ dopant-free HTMs. Significant progress has been made in this field leading to the emergence of new dopant-free polymeric and low molecular weight HTMs for perovskite solar cells.12–21 However, polytriarylamines for use as dopant-free HTMs in n–i–p PSCs are believed to have insufficient hole mobility. Therefore, only a mediocre 12.7% efficiency has been obtained so far using non-doped poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine (PTAA) in PSCs.22 Yet, PTAA represents one of the most promising HTMs for PSCs due to its favorable band alignment with the perovskite absorber and the advanced stability of the PTAA/perovskite interface. Surprisingly, only a limited effort was made to evaluate the effect of the molecular structure, chemical composition and film thickness of dopant-free PTAA-type HTMs on the PSC performance. A previous attempt to eliminate some methyl groups in the PTAA backbone was unsuccessful.23 Indeed, a similar polyarylamine with two methyl groups in the aromatic ring showed inferior performance as compared to the conventional PTAA comprising three methyl groups in each repeating unit. The observed performance deterioration was ascribed to a stronger aggregation of LiTFSI used as a doping reagent.23
However, methyl groups have an electron donating effect, which leads to an undesirable decrease in the ionization potential of the PTAA framework. Therefore, reducing the number of methyl groups in PTAA should result in a HTM with a deeper-lying HOMO energy level and improved band alignment at the HTM/perovskite interface.
In the present study, we introduce poly[bis(4-phenyl)(4-methylphenyl)amine] bearing only one methyl group in each repeating unit as a promising hole transport material for n–i–p perovskite solar cells. We show that this material has improved electronic properties (a deeper lying HOMO) and film morphology and clearly outperforms conventional PTAA as the HTM in PSCs.
Results and discussion
In this work, we compared two polytriarylamines loaded with different numbers of methyl groups as hole transport materials for perovskite solar cells (Fig. 1). For clarity, we use the commonly accepted abbreviation PTAA for commercial poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine], while poly[bis(4-phenyl)(4-methylphenyl)amine] will be referred to as PTA following the original report on the performance of this HTM in organic light emitting diodes.24

Cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S1, ESI†) was used to determine the oxidation potential of the polytriarylamines and then to estimate the HOMO levels using onsets of the oxidation waves.25 The HOMO energy of PTA was calculated to be −5.38 eV, which is expectedly lower than that of PTAA (−5.27 eV). According to these results, PTA should have better HOMO energy level alignment with the perovskite valence band (−5.4 eV) considering the energy values available in the literature.26
A comparable hole mobility of 1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 was estimated for both PTA and PTAA films using the hole-only device ITO/PEDOT-PSS/PTA(A)/F4TCNQ/MoO3/Ag and following the space charge limited current model (SCLC).
Generally, such low hole mobility implies that a sufficiently thin polymer film has to be deposited as the hole transport layer to avoid massive recombination of charge carriers.
For instance, the dopant-free PTAA is widely used in p–i–n solar cells since it is possible to obtain a uniform pinhole-free film on ITO substrates with less than 10 nm thickness.30 However, we found that such thin layers of PTAA deposited on top of the perovskite absorber layer in the n–i–p configuration do not provide sufficiently good isolation and lead to short-circuiting of a major fraction of the devices. Probably, this effect is related to the diffusion of metal (Au or Ag) through defects and pinholes in the films. The MoO3/Ag (or MoO3/Al) combination is known to increase the stability of perovskite solar cells due to the ability of molybdenum oxide to function as a diffusion barrier for perovskite degradation products, thus preventing their reaction with the top metal electrode due to the formation of insulating iodides at the interface.31 We followed this approach and showed that both PTA and PTA/MoO3 layers form uniform and pinhole-free coatings atop the perovskite absorber (Fig. S2, ESI†).
In order to evaluate the performance of PTAA and PTA as hole transport layer materials, we fabricated perovskite solar cells with the n–i–p structure with SnO2 functioning as the electron transport layer and Cs0.15FA0.85PbI2.55Br0.45 perovskite as the absorber layer (Fig. 1). The solar cells fabricated using PTA or PTAA as HTM coatings without any further treatment showed no significant difference in the photovoltaic performance while delivering comparable average PCEs of 10.9 ± 0.6% and 10.4 ± 1.1%, respectively (Fig. 2). The PTA-based cells showed an average VOC of 871 ± 11 mV, which was 25 mV higher than the average VOC of the cells assembled with PTAA (845 ± 16 mV). However, the improved open circuit voltage was partially counterbalanced by a lower average FF of 56.7 ± 2.3% as compared to the 60.5 ± 3.4% obtained for the reference PTAA cells.
 Fig. 2  The characteristics of ITO/SnO2/PCBM/Cs0.15FA0.85PbI2.55Br0.45/HTM/MoO3/Ag solar cells calculated from J–V curves measured in forward and reverse directions at a 20 mV s−1 scan rate depending on the HTM structure and processing conditions: PTA(A)/O2 – the substrates coated with polytriarylamine were left in air (RH 30–40%) for 12–16 hours to induce oxygen doping before the electrode evaporation; PTA(A)/O2/N2 – the PTA(A)/O2 devices were additionally annealed under an inert atmosphere at 85 °C for 10 minutes before the J–V measurements. Each solar cell in a batch is represented as a dot; red-colored dots represent forward scans, blue colored dots represent reverse scans. 
In order to further improve the device performance, the perovskite/HTM films were exposed to air to induce oxygen doping32 before the evaporation of top electrodes. Consequently, the average fill-factor of the PTAA cells did not change upon oxidation, while the PTA cells showed a minor increase in the average fill-factor up to 61.1 ± 2.0%. Moreover, when the solar cells were annealed after electrode deposition, the power conversion efficiency increased further mainly due to the increase of the open-circuit voltage, most probably due to the improved PTA/MoO3/Ag interface. Overall, the PTA cells showed an average PCE of 14.5 ± 0.7% with a top efficiency of 15.7%, which were considerably higher than those for the reference PTAA cells showing 12.3 ± 1.4% and 14.7% under the same conditions.
Interestingly, storage of the devices in a nitrogen glovebox (H2O < 0.1 ppm, O2 < 0.1 ppm) for 24 h further improved the device performance leading to top PCEs of 16.0% and 14.8% for the cells with PTA and PTAA HTMs, respectively (Table S1, ESI†). This improvement was mainly due to the additional increase in the fill factor upon post-annealing of the devices. These observations suggest that PTA is easier to dope through oxidation probably due to steric factors or somewhat coarser film morphology facilitating the penetration of oxygen into the material. It is worth noting that the solar cells with oxygen-doped PTA retained more than 80% of the maximal PCE for 1500 hours under constant 30 mW cm−2 illumination (Fig. S3†). At the same time, conventional doping of PTA assisted by addition of LiTFSI and tert-butylpyridine was not successful. The device performance gradually decreased with the increase in the mass of the added reagents. Such behavior corresponds to the previously reported enhanced aggregation of LiTFSI in methyl-less PTAA derivatives.23
The surface morphology of PTA and PTAA coatings deposited atop the perovskite films was studied by scanning probe microscopy (Fig. 3). The topography of the films mimicked the morphology of the underlying perovskite layer, while both HTM polymers formed almost ideal coverage of the perovskite grains. This conclusion was also supported by the cross-sectional SEM images (Fig. S4, ESI†).

Interestingly, when measuring the surface potential of the films by Kelvin probe force microscopy in the dark and under illumination, the samples show a distinct difference. Without illumination, a uniform distribution of the surface potential with ∼20 mV difference across the substrate was observed for the perovskite/PTAA sample. The perovskite/PTA sample showed a larger potential variation of 60 mV with dimple along the grain boundaries. Under illumination, the surface potential distribution remained the same, while the absolute values increased by 160 mV for PTA and by 80 mV for PTAA. A larger difference between the light and dark surface potentials suggests that a higher VOC is achievable for the system.33 Using the dark surface potentials, we estimated the average work function of the HTM polymer coating against a platinum probe calibrated on a fresh surface of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). The average work function of the PTAA film was 4.35 eV, while the PTA film showed a higher average work function of 4.40 eV. The observed difference in the work functions of PTA and PTAA HTMs correlates with the offset of the electrochemical oxidation potentials of these materials (and estimated HOMO positions) discussed above. At the same time, these results explain the origin of higher open circuit voltages delivered by devices using PTA as the hole transport material.
Inspired by the improved performance of PTA as the HTM for Cs0.15FA0.85PbI2.55Br0.45 perovskite solar cells we also fabricated devices using the conventional methylammonium lead iodide as the absorber. The J–V curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum for the top MAPbI3 cell are shown in Fig. 4. The best-performing solar cell with the PTA hole transport layer delivered a VOC of 1062 mV, JSC of 21.5 mA cm−2, FF of 74.2% and PCE of 17.0%.

A similar device with non-doped PTAA used as the HTM delivered much lower efficiency (∼10%) as confirmed by stabilized power output measurements (Fig. S5, ESI†). Notably, the achieved PCE of 17.0% represents a significant improvement in the performance of perovskite solar cells assembled with dopant-free hole transport materials based on polytriarylamines. This result also features PTA as a promising HTM for perovskite photovoltaics.
Conclusions
We have shown that polytriarylamine PTA introduced in this work comprising fewer methyl groups than conventional and commercially available PTAA can be considered as a highly promising hole transport material delivering improved performances in perovskite solar cells. In particular, PTA has deeper-lying HOMO and Fermi energy levels as compared to PTAA, thus resulting in a better match of the perovskite valence band and increase in the open circuit voltage of the devices. The optimized cells with the ITO/SnO2/PCBM/perovskite/PTA/MoO3/Ag architecture delivered maximal PCEs of 16% and 17% while using Cs0.15FA0.85PbI2.55Br0.45 and MAPbI3 perovskites, respectively. Thus, the results obtained in this work strongly suggest that PTA represents a superior hole-transport material for perovskite solar cells as compared to the widely used PTAA.
Experimental
Preparation of precursor solutions
For preparing the Cs0.15FA0.85PbI2.55Br0.45 precursor solution, 0.104 g CsBr, 0.600 g FAI, 1.600 g PbI2 and 0.184 g PbBr2 were dissolved together in a mixture of 0.280 mL of anhydrous DMSO and 1.930 mL of anhydrous DMF. For preparing the MAPbI3 precursor solution, 0.222 g of MAI and 0.461 g of PbI2 were dissolved together in a mixture of 0.800 mL of DMF and 0.200 mL of NMP. The precursor solutions were heated at 80 °C for an hour and then filtered through a 0.45 μm PTFE syringe filter.
Solar cell fabrication and characterization
Glass/ITO substrates (Kintec, 15 Ω sq−1) were sequentially cleaned with toluene, acetone, and isopropanol. Then the ITO slides were air-plasma treated for 5 minutes and immediately coated with a SnO2 layer by spin-coating a 10% aqueous tin dioxide suspension (Alfa-Aesar) at 4000 rpm for 40 s followed by annealing at 165 °C in air for 15 minutes. All subsequent steps were performed under an inert atmosphere inside a nitrogen glove box. A solution of PCBM (15 mg mL−1) was spin coated at 3000 rpm for 30 seconds. The perovskite precursor solutions (70 μL) were spin coated at 4000 rpm and quenched with 130 μL of toluene dropped 18 seconds later. The deposited films were annealed for 10 minutes at 100 °C on a hotplate. Then a solution of 4 mg mL−1 PTA or PTAA in toluene was spin-coated at 1000 rpm on top of the perovskite films. Molybdenum oxide (15 nm)/Ag (100 nm) electrodes were evaporated through a shadow mask. The device active area was 0.08 cm2 as defined by the shadow mask.
The current–voltage characteristics of the devices were measured in an inert nitrogen atmosphere inside a glove box using simulated AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) provided by a Newport VeraSol AAA class solar simulator. The intensity of the illumination was checked before each measurement using a calibrated silicon diode with a known spectral response. J–V curves were recorded using Advantest 6240A source-measurement units. EQE spectra were measured using a PV Instruments system integrated with an MBraun glove box.
Characterization techniques
Kelvin probe force microscopy measurements were performed in 2-pass amplitude modulation mode using a Cypher ES atomic force microscope installed in an Ar-filled MBraun glove box using conductive ASYELEC-01 probes. Atomic force microscopy measurements were performed in tapping mode using ASYELEC-01 probes. SEM images were obtained using a Zeiss SUPRA 25 instrument.
SCLC and CV measurements
Charge carrier mobilities were investigated using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method. To perform the measurements, hole-only ITO/PEDOT:PSS (60 nm)/polymer/F4TCNQ (1 nm)/MoO3 (22 nm)/Ag (120 nm) devices were fabricated. The charge carrier mobilities were estimated using a standard approach34 utilizing the part of the current–voltage characteristic after the trap filling threshold.
Cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed for thin films (150–250 nm thick) of the polymers PTA and PTAA deposited on a glassy carbon disc electrode (working electrode, d = 5 mm, BAS Inc.) by drop-casting from chlorobenzene. The measurements were performed in a three-electrode electrochemical cell using a 0.1 M solution of Bu4NPF6 in acetonitrile as the supporting electrolyte, a platinum wire as the counter electrode, and a silver wire immersed in a 0.01 M solution of AgNO3 in 0.1 M TBAP (CH3CN) as the reference Ag/Ag+ electrode (BAS Inc.). Ferrocene was used as the internal reference. The electrolyte solution was purged with argon before the measurements. The voltammograms were recorded using an ELINS P-30SM instrument at room temperature with a potential sweep rate of 50 mV s−1.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Band diagram for components of the solar cells and molecular structures of poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) and the synthesized poly[bis(4-phenyl)(4-methylphenyl)amine] (PTA). Band position values are taken from ref. 26–29 or measured experimentally.	 

 	Fig. 2  The characteristics of ITO/SnO2/PCBM/Cs0.15FA0.85PbI2.55Br0.45/HTM/MoO3/Ag solar cells calculated from J–V curves measured in forward and reverse directions at a 20 mV s−1 scan rate depending on the HTM structure and processing conditions: PTA(A)/O2 – the substrates coated with polytriarylamine were left in air (RH 30–40%) for 12–16 hours to induce oxygen doping before the electrode evaporation; PTA(A)/O2/N2 – the PTA(A)/O2 devices were additionally annealed under an inert atmosphere at 85 °C for 10 minutes before the J–V measurements. Each solar cell in a batch is represented as a dot; red-colored dots represent forward scans, blue colored dots represent reverse scans.	 

 	Fig. 3  AFM topography (top) and surface potential distribution images in the dark (middle) and under illumination (bottom) for ITO/SnO2/PCBM/Cs0.15FA0.85PbI2.55Br0.45/HTM stacks, where the HTM is PTA (left column) or PTAA (right column).	 

 	Fig. 4  Dark (black) and light-on J–V curves of the representative solar cell with the ITO/SnO2/PCBM/MAPbI3/PTA/MoO3/Ag architecture (A). External quantum efficiency spectrum and integrated short circuit current density of the device (B).
