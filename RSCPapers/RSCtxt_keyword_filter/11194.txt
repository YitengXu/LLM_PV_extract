Poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7) and 7,7′-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(6-fluoro-4-(5′-hexyl-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole) (F-DTS) possessing different compatibilities with EP-PDI were selected as model systems to investigate the guideline of SAs selection for different non-fullerene-based systems. According to the solubility parameter difference (Δδ) between EP-PDI and SAs, five different SAs were divided into two types: (I) strong intermolecular interactions with EP-PDI molecules (with Δδ values less than 5 MPa1/2), (II) weak intermolecular interactions with EP-PDI molecules (with large Δδ values). For PTB7:EP-PDI system with large and obvious phase separation, the introduction of type (II) SAs provided extra interactions with EP-PDI molecules, thus effectively reducing EP-PDI aggregate domains and increasing intermixed fractions. The incorporation of type (II) SAs resulted in a greater yield of dissociated polarons, and the final device efficiency increased from 0.02% to 1.65%. On the contrary, for finely mixed F-DTS:EP-PDI systems, type (I) SAs were considerably more effective because of the fact that the required pure crystalline phases were readily induced by the unfavorable interactions. The charge transport pathways optimized by type (I) SAs improved device efficiency from 0.18% to 2.82%. Hence, by processing selective SAs, the fraction of intermixed and pure crystalline phases for PDI-based non-fullerene OSCs can be well regulated; therefore, the final performance for both systems can be significantly improved.
1. Introduction
In the field of solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs), the photoactive layer based on the bulk heterojunction1,2 (BHJ) concept is always the important part. The morphology of photoactive layers covering domain size, domain purity, and aspects of crystallinity, as well as vertical phase separation, has proven to be extremely important in determining the optoelectronic properties in BHJ solar cells.3–7 The bicontinuous interpenetrating network morphology with optimal domain size and large interfacial area is the most widely accepted target in the creation of efficient devices.8 In addition, the crystalline portions of donor (and/or acceptor) materials have also been shown to be beneficial to charge transport.9 Recent attention has been turned to the ubiquitous molecular mixing between donor and acceptor materials, which results in a molecularly mixed phase, along with pure crystalline donor and acceptor phases.10–12 The presence and composition of the intermixed phase has also been demonstrated to have dramatic impact on the device performance.11,13
Because of the fact that the intermixed phase has energy levels that are shifted with respect to the pure aggregated phases, an energy cascade, which assists in the spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, can be produced,12–14 whereas, except for the role of effective charge-transport channels, the essential pure crystalline phases (including donor and acceptor crystalline regions) may be also an important or even critical driver for charge separation.14–17 Therefore, it is of great importance for controlling the equilibrium microstructure (i.e. balanced fraction of intermixed and pure phases) of BHJ OSCs. Investigations reported by numerous groups has shown that the fraction of donor–acceptor intermixed and pure crystalline phases can be well tuned via regulating the miscibility between donor and acceptor materials.18–21 Taking poly(3-hexyl selenophene) (P3HS)/PCBM system with high miscibility as an example, a larger fraction of PCBM can be dissolved in the polymer followed by a lower degree of phase segregation, thus contributing to much faster recombination kinetics.22 By varying the structure of the fullerene and decreasing polymer-fullerene miscibility, the relative fraction of polymer- and fullerene-rich domains increased, thus increasing charge collection efficiency.19
Except for fullerene-based OSCs, the critical role of the intermixed phase, as well as the pure crystalline phase, on the photophysics of the non-fullerene system is also attracting attention. By comparing the device physics and morphology of fullerene- and non-fullerene-based systems, Michael D. McGehee's group demonstrated that the low miscibility of acceptor material 4,7-bis(4-(N-hexyl-phthalimide)vinyl)benzo[c]1,2,5-thiadiazole (HPI-BT) in polymers prevented the formation of mixed-phase and energetic offsets, thus reducing the driving force for charges to separate into pure donor and acceptor phases.23 The control of miscibility and aggregation would also be achieved via the material design combined with a coating process for non-fullerene-based OSCs.15,18 A low band gap p-type polymer with modified conjugated side chains possessed comparatively good miscibility with naphthalene diimide (NDI)-based n-type polymer, thus obtaining a uniform structure. The introduction of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) increased the pure crystalline domain of the n-type polymer before significant phase separation occurred, finally greatly improving device performance.18
Compared with the control of miscibility by complicated molecular synthesis, tuning intermolecular interactions by introducing specific solvent additives (SAs) is a considerably simpler and more effective technique in regulating the fractions of the intermixed phase and relatively phase-pure regions. Although morphological control by processing SAs has been extensively used and the criteria for incorporating SAs to specific fullerene-based systems have been identified in depth,24–29 there is still a lack of systematic approach for guiding the selection of processing SAs for non-fullerene-based systems, the equilibrium microstructures of which are of equal importance. In this report, we selected N,N′-bis(1-ethylpropyl)-perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide (EP-PDI)-based non-fullerene system as a subject to tune the equilibrium microstructures of active layers via selective SAs. Poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7) and 7,7′-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(6-fluoro-4-(5′-hexyl-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole) (F-DTS) possessing different compatibilities with EP-PDI were selected as two typical model systems to explore the guidelines of SA selection. We were surprised to find that the specific types of SAs played specific roles in these systems. By utilizing selective SAs, considerably balanced intermixed and pure crystalline phases can be achieved for both PTB7:EP-PDI unmixed system and F-DTS:EP-PDI finely mixed system, thus optimizing exciton dissociation and charge transport processes. Thus, a guideline of SA selection was provided for PDI-based non-fullerene OSCs, and the roles of specific SAs in the optimization of three-phase (amorphous intermixed phase, donor pure phase and acceptor pure phase) BHJ morphology is also presented.

2.2. Device fabrication and testing
Organic solar cells were fabricated on indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates pre-treated with water, acetone and isopropanol in an ultrasonic bath followed by cleaning for 25 min with UV ozone. Poly(ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) layer with a thickness of 25 nm was spin-coated on well-cleaned ITO substrates and dried at 140 °C in a vacuum for 10 min. PTB7:EP-PDI (1:2 w/w, 30 mg mL−1) solutions with the optimal amounts of SAs in CB were spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 30 seconds on top of a PEDOT:PSS layer in a glove box to obtain an active layer of around 100 nm. For an F-DTS:EP-PDI (1:1 w/w, 30 mg mL−1) system, solutions were heated for 12 hours and casted at 80 °C to produce films with approximately 100 nm (the blended films were spin-coated at 1500 rpm for 30 seconds). Finally, a bilayer structure of Ca (30 nm)/Al (90 nm) was deposited on the top of the active layer by thermal evaporation under a vacuum of 2 × 10−4 Pa for complete device fabrication. All the devices were prepared under the same deposition condition and used without further post-treatment. Four solar cells, each with an active area of 12 mm2, were fabricated per ITO glass substrate.
2.3. Characterization
The morphology of the active layer was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). TEM experiments were performed on a TEM-1011 (JEOL Co., Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. AFM experiments were carried out using Veeco Instruments Nanoscope in tapping mode. A silicon microcantilever (spring constant 2 N m−1 and resonant frequency ≈ 70 kHz, Olympus, Japan) was used for scanning. The crystallinity of the active layer was characterized by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) studies. GIXD patterns were measured with a D8 Discover diffractometer (Bruker, Germany) (λ = 1.54 Å). A fixed grazing incidence angle of 0.2° was used to reduce the scattering from the substrates. SAED patterns were obtained with a JEOL JEM-1011 transmission electron microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. Solid-state UV-vis absorption spectra for the active layers were recorded with a Lambda 750 spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, MA). Raman spectra of the active layers were recorded using a Jobin Yvon LabRAM HR spectrometer. A 532 nm solid-state laser was chosen as the excitation light source. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the organic solar cells were measured using a computer-controlled Keithley 236 source meter under AM1.5G illumination from a calibrated solar simulator with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Classifying SAs by intermolecular interactions between EP-PDI and solvent molecules
The morphology of active layers is known to closely correlate to the degree of interaction between various materials in the film and the interactions of the materials with solvents.30 Unfavorable interactions between donor and acceptor materials often lead to large degrees of phase separation. On the contrary, for donor and acceptor materials with good miscibility, they usually exhibit a considerably lower driving force for phase separation when both materials are finely intermixed in the amorphous state. Because the relative solubility of each material in different solvents significantly influences the film morphology, the SA approach, as a simple yet effective method, is often adopted in the morphology control. In this article, five SAs, including 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), 1,8-octanedithiol (ODT), chloronaphthalene (CN), 1-benzothiophene (BT) and 2,3-benzofuran (BF) (the chemical structures are shown in Scheme 1), were employed to regulate the morphology of active layers in two PDI-based non-fullerene OSCs.
To predict the solubility, and thus provide a guideline for SA selection, the solubility parameter (δ) is utilized to estimate the miscibility between SAs and the active materials. Because the host solvent chlorobenzene (CB) molecules evaporated during the initial stage of film formation, the interactions between additives and host solvent do not present major concern here.31 Using group contribution theory of Small, Hoy and van Krevelen,32 the solubility parameters of these SAs could be easily calculated (Table S1, ESI†). However, considering the unknown factor of density value, the δ for EP-PDI material using the same approach is not readily available. Therefore, a less accurate group contribution theory proposed by Fedors33 was used to calculate the δ values for both the SAs (as shown in Table S1, ESI†) and EP-PDI material (with the δ value of 27.8 MPa1/2). The solubility parameter difference (Δδ) could be used to approximately illustrate the degree of intermolecular interactions between the additive molecules and EP-PDI molecule, despite the δ values of these SAs calculated by this approach are generally higher. It is considered that strong interactions exist between two molecules when the Δδ value is as small as possible.31

Fig. 1 displays the Δδ values between SAs and EP-PDI material and the boiling points (Tb) of five different SAs. It can be observed that the Δδ value is relatively larger for DIO and ODT SAs. On the contrary, this value for CN, BT and BF SAs is generally less than 5 MPa1/2. The profound differences in Δδ value are consistent with the solubility of EP-PDI in these solvents (Table S1, ESI†). Thus, depending on the degree of interactions with EP-PDI, these selected SAs can be divided into two types: (I) possessing comparatively weak intermolecular interactions with EP-PDI (i.e., the solubility of EP-PDI in the solvent is poor), e.g., DIO and ODT; (II) possessing strong intermolecular interactions with EP-PDI (i.e., the solubility of EP-PDI in the solvent is >50 mg mL−1), e.g., CN, BT and BF. In addition, the duration of interactions, which is directly related to the Tb, should also be considered. Compared with the host solvent CB (with the Tb of around 132 °C), the Tb of the SAs was significantly higher (as shown in Fig. 1). For type (II) SAs, three solvents with different Tb values were employed to adjust the duration of the interactions.

3.2. Reducing the aggregation of EP-PDI domains and increasing the fraction of intermixed phase for unmixed system via selective SAs
For a PTB7:EP-PDI unmixed system, EP-PDI molecules tend to form micro-sized aggregates, thus leading to large scale phase separation. Using selective SAs that have strong intermolecular interactions with EP-PDI (i.e., type (II) SAs), EP-PDI aggregated domains were dramatically reduced, and the fraction of the intermixed donor–acceptor phase significantly increased. Moreover, the intermolecular interactions of EP-PDI were also enhanced after introducing SAs. Therefore, the introduction of type (II) solvents would simultaneously promote the formation of a disordered intermixed phase and maintain a certain amount of pure EP-PDI crystalline phases with considerably stronger interactions between EP-PDI molecules.
To obtain a clear illustration of film morphologies in the PTB7:EP-PDI blends with various SAs, TEM images (Fig. 2) and AFM height images (Fig. 3) were utilized. Apparently, EP-PDI molecules prefer to form aggregation rather than completely mix in the PTB7 phase, thus resulting in large scale phase separation. The introduction of a certain amount of type (II) SAs (CN, BT and BF) favorably reduced the phase separation extent. Moreover, two weakened diffraction rings corresponding to the (004) and (211) planes of EP-PDI in the SAED patterns34,35 indicate that the crystallinity of EP-PDI was decreased after employing type (II) SAs. AFM height images presented in Fig. 3 display that type (II) SAs significantly reduced the film roughness from more than 30 nm to less than 5 nm. On the contrary, when type (I) solvent, such as DIO or ODT, was employed, the initial unfavorable morphology character almost remained unchanged. By contrasting the effects of CN, BT and BF solvents on film morphology, it can be found that the addition of a CN solvent with a higher boiling point obtained more continuous aggregates, whereas the film exhibited more distributed island-like aggregates when the latter two solvents were employed. We speculate that the duration of interactions between SAs and EP-PDI molecules might be primarily responsible for the morphological difference. The slower volatilization rate of CN solvent (with Tb as high as 259 °C) results in extended time for domain growth, thus finally establishing a more continuous pathway composed of EP-PDI-ordered aggregates. Nevertheless, the introduction of BT (Tb = 221 °C) and BF (Tb = 173 °C) with low Tb exhibited relatively weak effects on the film-forming kinetics, and thus resulted in the formation of less continuous aggregates.

UV-vis spectra and GIXD patterns were utilized for PTB7:EP-PDI (1:2, w/w) blends to further study how the fraction of disordered intermixed phase and pure crystalline phase changes with the types of additives. As Fig. 4 shows, after introducing type (II) SAs, the peak intensity at around 600 nm, which indicates the formation of H-type aggregates,36,37 weakened, followed by the remarkable enhancement of the absorption bands (0–0, 0–1 and 0–2 at 536, 495 and 466 nm, respectively) of the EP-PDI molecules. The latter generally appears in the absorption spectrum of the EP-PDI dilute solution (Fig. S1, ESI†) and reflects the property of free molecules.38 This conversion of UV-vis spectra indicates that more EP-PDI molecules exist in the amorphous state, thus providing more opportunity to form an intermixed donor–acceptor phase. GIXD patterns shown in Fig. 4(b) also reflect the impact of type (II) SAs on EP-PDI-ordered aggregation. The diffraction peaks corresponding to the (200) and (400) planes of EP-PDI became weak, indicating that the crystallinity of EP-PDI domains throughout the blended films significantly decreased. Nevertheless, UV-vis spectra, as well as GIXD patterns, exhibited little variation when type (I) SAs were employed, which were consistent with the aforementioned morphological characters.

Because selective SAs play a remarkable role in morphology control, it is necessary to explore the effect of SAs on the intermolecular interactions between EP-PDI molecules, which closely relate to the charge transport of free charges. It has also been reported by P. E. Keivanidis group that Raman spectroscopy measurements could be performed to investigate the process of PDI aggregation.39 The 1604 cm−1 peak in the Raman spectra corresponding to the in-plane CC/C–C stretching/shrinking of the perylene aromatic ring core coupled to the CO antisymmetric stretching is sensitive to perylene–perylene π–π stacking, whereas the 1300 cm−1 peak intensity and frequency do not change upon aggregation phenomena.39 Therefore, the Raman intensity ratio of 1604 cm−1/1300 cm−1 can be utilized as an effective marker to monitor the aggregation phenomena of EP-PDI component (Fig. S2, ESI†). Surprisingly, the increase seen in the 1604 cm−1/1300 cm−1 Raman intensity ratio is followed by a dramatic decrease in the film roughness with the addition of type (II) SAs (Fig. 4(c)). This implies that although selective SAs suppress the large scale aggregation of EP-PDI and add the fraction of an amorphous intermixed phase, the π–π stacking interactions between EP-PDI molecules do not diminish but instead strengthen, as shown in Fig. 4(d). Therefore, we speculate that the strong intermolecular interactions between selective SAs and EP-PDI inhibited the formation of large scale EP-PDI aggregates, thus creating more intermixed phases. In addition, the introduced SAs with high boiling points extended (compared with the host solvent) film formation time, and thus enhanced the π–π stacking between EP-PDI molecules.
3.3. Increasing the fraction of pure crystalline phases for finely mixed system via selective SAs
In a sharp contrast with the PTB7:EP-PDI system, an appearance of considerably smoother surface was presented in the F-DTS:EP-PDI system (Fig. 5 and 6), which demonstrated a strong tendency for EP-PDI and F-DTS to form a mixed phase. Using selective SAs that possess weak intermolecular interactions with EP-PDI (i.e., type (I) SAs), more pure and ordered donor phases, as well as acceptor phases, were formed. In addition, the use of type (II) SAs that could extend the duration of interactions between solvent and EP-PDI material will also facilitate the self-assembly behavior of F-DTS and EP-PDI, thus creating certain amounts of pure crystalline phases.

TEM images (Fig. 5), as well as AFM height images (Fig. 6), represent the morphological characters after the introduction of two types of SAs. Presumably because of much better compatibility between F-DTS and EP-PDI, the F-DTS:EP-PDI film spin-coated from pure CB had a uniform structure with a film roughness of around 1 nm. The introduction of type (I) SAs significantly increased the film roughness, followed by the enhanced intensity of diffraction rings corresponding to the (004) and (211) planes of EP-PDI in the SAED patterns. When type (II) SAs were used, much smoother films with roughness of less than 1 nm were obtained. Moreover, the dispersed diffraction rings, shown in Fig. 5(e)–(g), indicate that the crystallinity of the blended films continued to weaken with the addition of type (II) solvents. It should be noted that the decreased crystallinity induced by a type (II) solvent would not occur as soon as the amount of SAs, such as CN, further increased (from 0.75% to 1.0%) as shown in Fig. 5(d). This exception implies that further extended duration interactions between SAs and EP-PDI molecules also have a certain extent of positive influence on film crystallinity.
To further compare the crystallinity of F-DTS:EP-PDI blended films processed from various SAs, UV-vis spectra, GIXD patterns and Raman spectra were also obtained, as shown in Fig. 7. In contrast to the phenomenon observed in PTB7:EP-PDI system, F-DTS:EP-PDI blended films spin–coated from CB display relatively weak crystallinity. The appearance of obvious absorption bands corresponding to 0–0, 0–1 and 0–2 transitions of the EP-PDI molecules, as well as the absence of F-DTS absorption in the long-wavelength regime (around 678 nm), suggest that EP-PDI molecules serve to disturb some of the solid-state ordering of F-DTS, thus producing more efficient intermixed phases in an amorphous state.40 In GIXD patterns, the weak intensity of diffraction peaks corresponding to the (200) plane of EP-PDI (2θ = 5.23°) and (011) plane of F-DTS (2θ = 6.18°)40 is also indicative of limited intermolecular packing. When type (I) SAs were employed, the appearance of vibronic structure at 678 nm in UV-vis spectra together with three extremely strong diffraction peaks corresponding to the (001), (002) and (003) planes of F-DTS (2θ = 4.05°, 7.95°, and 11.95°)40 demonstrated the increased fraction of the pure crystalline phase of F-DTS. On the contrary, for most of the type (II) solvents employed, the crystallization process of F-DTS was severely inhibited. Unexpectedly, the crystallinity of F-DTS significantly increased when more CN additive (with a volume fraction of 1.0%) was added, which was also regarded as one of the type (II) solvents. The effect of SAs on intermolecular interactions between EP-PDI molecules was further investigated by Raman spectra, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The variation of the 1604 cm−1/1300 cm−1 Raman intensity ratio, summarized in Fig. 7(c), was in good agreement with that of the film roughness, which means that the enhanced intermolecular packing of EP-PDI molecules makes a valuable contribution to the aggregation behavior of blended films. The different variation trends for PTB7/EP-PDI (Fig. 4(c)) and F-DTS/EP-PDI (Fig. 7(c)) systems shown in Raman spectra are expected to be attributed to the different miscibility between donor and acceptor materials. Combined with the variation of F-DTS crystallization, we consider that the introduction of type (I) SAs will efficiently increase pure crystalline phases for both donor and acceptor materials, as shown in Fig. 7(d). In addition, the use of type (II) SAs that could extend the duration of interactions between solvent and semiconducting materials will also facilitate the self-assembly behaviors of F-DTS and EP-PDI, thus forming certain amounts of pure crystalline phases (including donor and acceptor materials), as well.

3.4. Achieving optimized device performance for PDI-based non-fullerene OSCs via selective SAs
For a PTB7:EP-PDI unmixed system, micro-sized EP-PDI aggregates were efficiently suppressed by the introduction of type (II) SAs. In addition, the increased fraction of an amorphous intermixed phase facilitated the formation of energetic offsets between the mixed and pure phases, thus assisting in free-charge generation.23 The optimized exciton dissociation process contributes to the final improvement of power conversion efficiency (PCE) values from 0.02% to 1.65%, whereas for a F-DTS:EP-PDI finely mixed system, the introduction of type (I) SAs increased the fraction of pure crystalline phases for both donor and acceptor materials, thus improving the percolation pathways for both hole and electron carriers. The optimized carrier transport is expected to be beneficial to the enhancement of short current density (JSC), therefore achieving significantly improved PCEs from 0.18% to 2.82%.
The effects of SAs on the device performance of PTB7:EP-PDI blend system are shown in Fig. 8(a) and (b), and the photovoltaic properties of solar cells processed with different SAs are summarized in Table 1. Because of the micron-sized aggregates of EP-PDI formed in PTB7:EP-PDI system, the donor–acceptor interfacial area was significantly decreased followed by the reduced yield of dissociated polarons, thus inducing poor JSC value. Moreover, the rough active layer caused by EP-PDI aggregates may form some shunt paths after top electrode deposition, thus resulting in a low open circuit (VOC).41 Therefore, OSCs based on PTB7:EP-PDI system without SAs exhibit extremely poor efficiency (PCE = 0.02%). As previously mentioned, the film morphology was significantly improved, and considerably more amorphous intermixed phases were generated with the introduction of type (II) SAs. The optimized phase-separated morphology, as well as the formation of more intermixed phases, is believed to facilitate charge generation.12 In addition, considerably stronger π–π stacking between EP-PDI molecules induced by the extended time for the film formation promoted free-electron transport in the acceptor phases. Thus, the device with CN SAs exhibited a significantly enhanced PCE value of 1.65%, with an open-circuit (VOC) of 0.72, short-circuit current (JSC) of 4.93, and fill-factor (FF) of 0.47. Similar to the effect of the CN solvent, BT and BF as type (II) SAs, also played positive roles in the optimization of film morphology, thus achieving PCE values to 1.2% and 0.6%, respectively. It is assumed that the shorter duration of interactions between BT (or BF) additives and EP-PDI molecules because of the lower boiling points of SAs makes it difficult to form a more continuous crystalline pathway for charge carriers, therefore obtaining comparatively lower efficiency. From the EQE spectra, shown in Fig. 8(b), it can be seen that EQE values in the range of 400–600 nm, where EP-PDI component exhibits strong absorption, significantly enhanced with the introduction of type (II) solvents with higher boiling points. This means that more and more acceptor components are involved in the generation of charge-transfer states and charge carriers after optimizing film morphology by type (II) SAs. On the contrary, film morphology, as well as device efficiencies (with PCEs of less than 0.01%, which are not shown in Fig. 8), exhibited almost no improvement by type (I) SAs. According to the morphological characters, discussed in Section 3.2, we assume that type (I) solvent molecules, possessing poor intermolecular interactions with EP-PDI, could not help to restrict interactions between EP-PDI molecules, thus reducing EP-PDI aggregation behavior. Therefore, for an unmixed system (PTB7:EP-PDI), selective SAs that possess good intermolecular interactions with EP-PDI would effectively optimize phase-separated morphology, increase the fraction of intermixed phase and enhance π–π stacking between EP-PDI molecules, and finally achieve the optimization of charge generation and charge transport.

The effects of SAs on the device performance of finely mixed F-DTS:EP-PDI blend systems are shown in Fig. 8(c) and (d), and the photovoltaic properties of solar cells processed with different SAs are summarized in Table 2. Although F-DTS and EP-PDI are finely mixed and uniform structures are formed, OSCs based on the F-DTS:EP-PDI system without SAs still exhibit poor efficiency with the PCE value of less than 0.2%. The highly mixed morphology is expected to limit the carrier transport because of a lack of continuous pathway, thus resulting in a high recombination rate.19 When type (I) SAs were employed, the fraction of pure crystalline phases for both donor and acceptor materials were remarkably enhanced, and the free charge transport paths were optimized. The best device performance with a PCE of 2.82% was obtained when DIO and ODT were used as SAs. This value is very close to the efficiency of 3.0%, in agreement with the identical system reported by Guillermo C. Bazan group, in which the close relationship between the properties of SAs and optimized morphology were not elucidated.42 In addition, the EQE spectrum of the F-DTS:EP-PDI devices show significant contributions from regions associated with both F-DTS and EP-PDI absorption. On the contrary, the addition of type (II) SAs, such as BF and BT, showed limited improvement in device performance. This is in accordance with the variation of the morphology character mentioned in Section 3.3. One exception was that the film crystallinity was further increased, and the corresponding device performance reached 2.0% when comparatively more CN (1.0%) was employed. We assume that the prolonged duration of interactions between CN solvent molecules and EP-PDI molecules promotes molecular diffusion for both F-DTS and EP-PDI, thus inducing the formation of pure crystalline phases. To demonstrate our speculation, the F-DTS:EP-PDI blended films processed with 0.75% CN were prepared under different conditions, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). A blended film was spin-coated at 1500 rpm for 30 seconds. Another blended film was spin-coated at 1500 rpm for 10 seconds, and then immediately transferred to a sealed container. The second film was kept in a sealed container for 5 minutes. Surprisingly, the colour of the blended film changed from purple to dark green after seal processing, which implies the increased film crystallinity. Moreover, the device performance significantly improved from 0.73% to 2.1%. Therefore, similar to the effect of type (I) SAs, certain amounts of pure crystalline phases for a finely mixed system can also be generated by extending the duration of the interactions, thus improving PCE values to certain extent.

4. Conclusions
According to the degree of intermolecular interactions with EP-PDI molecule, the employed SAs were divided into two types: type (I) SAs, such as DIO and ODT, possess weak interactions with EP-PDI, while type (II) SAs, such as CN, BT and BF, possess strong interactions with EP-PDI. Selective SAs was selected to obtain the desired regulation of morphology for different PDI-based non-fullerene OSCs. For a PTB7:EP-PDI system with micron-sized phase separation, the introduction of type (II) SAs provided extra interactions with EP-PDI molecules, thus effectively reducing EP-PDI aggregate domains and increasing the fraction of the amorphous intermixed phase. Moreover, the π–π stacking between the EP-PDI molecules was also enhanced. Therefore, the incorporation of type (II) SAs facilitated the generation of charge transfer states, as well as charge carriers, thus leading to increased PCE values from 0.02% to 1.65%. Nevertheless, for finely mixed F-DTS:EP-PDI systems, type (I) SAs were considerably more effective. The required pure crystalline phases were readily induced by the unfavorable interactions between SAs and EP-PDI. In addition, certain amount of pure crystalline phase could also be generated via extending the duration between type (II) SA and EP-PDI. The charge transport paths optimized by type (I) SAs resulted in the significant improvement of PCE values from 0.18% to 2.82%. Therefore, by processing selective SAs, balanced intermixed and pure crystalline phases for PDI-based non-fullerene OSCs can be achieved and the device performance for both the systems can be significantly improved.
