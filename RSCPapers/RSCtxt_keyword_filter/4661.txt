    , Accepted 13th December 2017First published on 14th December 2017AbstractA new class of copolymers containing oligothiophene moieties with different lengths and fullerene units have been designed and prepared by an easy and inexpensive one-step synthetic approach. The incorporation of small quantities of these copolymers into bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells with donor regioregular polythiophene (P3HT) and an acceptor fullerene derivate (PCBM) results in good control of the phase separation process without further affecting the BHJ optoelectronic properties. Indeed, under thermal annealing these copolymers allow the modulation of the growth of domains whose size depends on the length of the copolymer repetitive units. Domain size on the same length scale as the P3HT exciton diffusion length with a good continuity between the electrodes gives efficient exciton dissociation and charge mobility. Thus by employing copolymers containing oligothiophenic chains with a size of about 8 nm, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) (4.46%) and short current density (JSC) (16.15 mA cm−2) values are the highest reported so far for P3HT:PCBM solar cells on plastic substrates.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted considerable interest because of their potential for low-cost and simple manufacturing processes.1–4 Devices based on P3HT:PCBM thin film heterojunctions are among the most studied, providing a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3–6% in bulk heterojunctions (BHJs).5,6 In the last few years, even better PCE values have been obtained, thanks to the development of new materials and the design of new architectures.7–15 Many efforts have been made on the development of low band-gap polymers, fullerene derivatives, and additives for obtaining a controlled morphology and improved performance of the heterojunctions.16,17
The use of plastic substrates for OSCs opens new application fields allowing the development of light, portable, biocompatible, and flexible devices, thus making them implementable on tissues and curved surfaces.18–21 However, when OSCs are realized on a plastic substrate instead of glass, PCE values further decrease (0.08–2.7% for P3HT:PCBM OSCs) just due to the plastic substrate providing higher surface resistivity of the electrode and lower light transparency.22–25 In order to make OSCs suitable for large-scale implementation and successful commercialization, it is crucial to find solutions to improve their performance and this is even more important for plastic OSCs due to their lower performance.
Among the many factors that affect the device performance, morphology plays a prominent role. Different approaches are being carried out with the aim of controlling the morphology of the BHJs and tuning the nano-phase separation of donor and acceptor components. Indeed, one of the main reasons limiting the efficiency of OSCs is the poor miscibility of acceptor fullerene derivatives and donor conjugated polymers, resulting in the formation of domains with sizes significantly exceeding the donor exciton diffusion length (EDL).17,26–29 For this purpose, thermal annealing or solvent treatment has been already successfully used, achieving significantly increased PCE.30–36 Another useful approach toward adequate control of morphology is the introduction of small quantities of semiconducting additives that can interact with the blend components into BHJs to improve their miscibility.37–41 Particularly, the chemical structure of such additives may be deeply different: small molecules of compatibilizers, usually comprising oligothiophene moieties linked to a fullerene unit, shown to stabilize the morphology of the donor/acceptor blend.42–46 On the other hand, diblock copolymers have been widely studied and used as biphasic compatibilizers,47–55 exploiting their amphiphilic nature and their ability to affect the domain size and the crystallinity of the active layer. A step further has been the incorporation of fullerene into the polymer structure56–58 of diblock and triblock copolymers59–63 as well as in the backbone of conjugated polymers.64–66
Hiorns et al. reported that the introduction into P3HT:PCBM BHJs of a fullerene end-capped block copolymer based on P3HT and polystyrene moieties induces a favourable morphology with an interpenetrating network and an increase of polymer crystallinity.63 Similar results have been obtained by Chen et al. by using end-functionalized P3HTs and diblock copolymers containing P3HT.51 They showed that the decrease of domain size and the enhancement of P3HT crystallinity do not necessarily lead to the creation of BHJ structures with improved photovoltaic performances. Indeed, a good nanophase separation of the donor/acceptor blend layer can be much more important than high crystallinity. Park et al. demonstrated that the reduced crystallinity of the active layer ensures a good mixing of donor and acceptor materials and thus an optimized nanophase separation.67 In the same way, Yang et al. showed enhanced efficiency by adding 5% of diblock copolymer, due to the improved interfacial morphology between the two immiscible components of the heterojunction.60 However, most of the studies showing improved performances report only a slight increase of PCE or JSC, mainly due to the nature of the copolymer units. Indeed, the electrical properties of the blocks of copolymers play a key role in the performance of the OSCs. For example, the presence of bulky insulating blocks hinders the exciton transport to the donor/acceptor interface, resulting in an increase of the series resistance and deteriorating the charge carrier transport in the device.60,63 Moreover, the development of block copolymers involves tedious synthetic procedures with multiple post-polymerization steps, all of them requiring the complete characterization of the intermediate materials. The whole process results in high time consumption and affects both the yield and the cost of the final materials.
In the present work, three novel copolymers in which C60 units and oligothiophenes of different lengths (13, 21 and 40 thiophenes, on average, respectively) are staggered without any additional insulating spacer, have been designed, easily synthesized, characterized, and employed in P3HT:PCBM plastic BHJ OSCs. One of the main novelties relies on the synthesis and the use of a fulleropyrrolidine endowed with two bithiophene moieties with a well-defined stereochemistry that can promptly be co-polymerized with other bithiophene derivatives. Then, the effect of the oligothiophene moiety chain length in the copolymer on the structure and optoelectronic properties of the heterojunction has been investigated together with the influence of the different amounts of the copolymers on the plastic OSC performance. We anticipate that such systems allowed defining a new strategy to improve the OSC performance by controlling the nanophase morphology of the thin film BHJ resulting in record PCE values for P3HT:PCBM plastic OSCs.

Materials and methods

Spectroscopic characterization of thin films. 

1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 300 MHz spectrometer. FT-IR spectra (KBr disk) were recorded on an Agilent Technologies Cary 630 FT-IR infrared spectrophotometer. UV-vis spectra were recorded in chloroform with a Beckman Coulter DU 800 spectrophotometer. UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectra were recorded on thin films spin-coated onto ITO/PET substrates (indium tin oxide coated poly(ethylene terephthalate)) (Aldrich, surface resistivity 60 Ω sq−1), using a Specord S 600 (Analytik Jena, Jena, Germany) and Fluoromax-4 (HORIBA Jobin Yvon, Edison, USA) spectrofluorometer equipped with a 150 W xenon arc lamp as the excitation source, respectively. In particular, the pristine materials (16 mg mL−1) and the blend solutions (30 mg mL−1, P3HT:PCBM 1:0.8) in o-dichlorobenzene were stirred, filtered through a 0.45 μm filter, and subsequently spin-coated at 1500 rpm on the ITO/PET.
XPS spectra for samples 5a–c, drop cast and spin coated over ITO/PET were acquired using an ULVAC-PHI PHI 5000 VersaProbe II Scanning XPS Microprobe™, Al Kα source (1486.6 eV), 128 channel hemispherical analyzer, FAT mode. Low resolution spectra (1100–0 eV; 1.000 eV step) and high resolution spectra (C 1s, N 1s and S 2p regions; 0.050 eV step) were collected using a 200 μm beam (15 kV, 50 W) with a take off angle of 45°.

Atomic force microscopy. 
Freshly prepared BHJ thin films with and without additives have been left to dry and then promptly imaged. AFM analysis has been performed using a Multimode 5 microscope coupled with a Nanoscope V controller (Veeco, Germany). All images have been acquired by using commercial etched-silicon probes (RTESP type tips; Bruker, Germany) and rastering 512 × 512 points per image, using a constant scan rate less than 1 line per s. The domain size statistical analysis has been performed using a NanoScope (Bruker, Germany) and Gwyddion free software over tens of images.


Electrochemistry. 
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the compounds 3, 5a–c and P3HT were recorded with a potentiostat/galvanostat (Metrohm Autolab PGSTAT 128N) in a three electrode cell using a platinum working electrode, a glassy carbon (GC diameter = 3 mm, Bio-Logic SAS) counter electrode, and a Ag/AgCl (Hanna Instruments) reference electrode respectively. A solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate in a mixture of ortho-dichlorobenzene–acetonitrile (4:1 v/v) was used as the supporting electrolyte under continuous nitrogen flow. The CV characterization of the compounds was performed at a scan rate of 200 mV s−1 using concentrations ranging between 0.5 and 1 × 10−3 M. The HOMO level was calculated from the onset oxidation potential [Eonset,ox],68 according to eqn (1): EHOMO = −(E[onset,ox vs. NHE] + 4.5)(1)where E[onset,ox vs. NHE] is the potential for oxidation of the copolymer vs. Ag/AgCl compared to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), while 4.5 eV is equivalent to 0.0 V vs. the NHE.
The LUMO level was obtained from eqn (2): LUMO = HOMO + Eoptg(2)
Absorption spectra acquired on deposited compounds by drop casting on ITO/PET were used for evaluation of the optical band gaps (Eoptg) of the compounds, according to the procedure applied for an indirect band gap semiconductor. The value of the band gap, in electron volts, was calculated by the absorption spectrum fitting (ASF) method, in particular using the parameter λg from the following eqn (3): Eg = 1239.83/λg(3)where the parameter λg can be extrapolated from the linear of the (Abs(λ)/λ)1/mvs. the 1/λ curve at (Abs/λ)1/m = 0.69


Device fabrication. 
OSCs were prepared using a spin coating technique on flexible ITO/PET substrates cleaned sequentially by sonication in methanol, acetone and isopropanol for 10 min each and exposed to a UV-ozone cleaner (Procleaner Plus, Bioforce) for 60 min. The hole transport material (∼40 nm) (poly(ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate), PEDOT:PSS, Aldrich, 1.3 wt% dispersion in H2O, conductive grade) was spin-coated at 4000 rpm and dried at 100 °C for 10 min on a hot plate under air. The substrates were transferred into a glovebox system (MBraun, Germany) filled with N2 (<0.1 ppm of O2 and H2O), where heterojunctions were deposited. In particular, a blend solution (30 mg mL−1) of P3HT:PCBM (1:0.8) in o-dichlorobenzene with different copolymers was stirred, filtered through a 0.45 μm filter, and subsequently spin-coated at 1500 rpm (∼110 nm) on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS layer. Always in the gloveboxes, a 1 nm LiF layer and 100 nm Al were thermally evaporated to complete the devices. Thermal processes for device annealing and aging processes have been performed within the gloveboxes.


Electrical measurements. 
Photovoltaic devices were characterized by using a halogen lamp as the illumination source, having an irradiation power of 100 mW cm−2. I–V curves were acquired in a glovebox system (MBraun, Germany) filled with N2 (<0.1 ppm of O2 and H2O), by using a Keithley 2400 source meter.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
We designed the synthesis of a novel suitable fullerene monomer to be inserted into polymeric chains able to display a well-defined stereochemistry. For doing so we followed a slightly modified procedure recently reported in the literature.70 Thus, fulleropyrrolidine 3 was obtained by the reaction between C60, aldehyde 1, and amine 2 (obtained by means of reductive amination of 1 with octylamine using NaBH4 as a reductant71 – see ESI†). A careful optimization allowed obtaining the desired product with a good yield (51%) and a high stereoselectivity towards the trans isomer (see below for details). Finally, FeCl3-mediated oxidative polymerization of fulleropyrrolidine 3 and different amounts of 3,4′-dihexyl-2,2′-bithiophene 4 afforded the copolymers 5a–c, containing oligothiophene moieties with different lengths and fullerene units, in 58–60% yield (Scheme 1).

Physico-chemical characterization

Monomers and copolymers. 
The 1H NMR spectrum of fulleropyrrolidine derivative 3 is reported in Fig. 1a, whereas the 1H NMR spectra of copolymers 5a–c are overlapped as shown in Fig. 1b. It is worth pointing out that the synthesis of compound 3 could afford both cis and trans isomers. However, as determined by the ratio of the integrated areas of peaks centred at 6.49 and 5.86 ppm (Fig. 1a) associated with protons of the pyrrolidine moiety of trans and cis isomers, respectively, the reaction proceeds with a high stereoselectivity towards the trans isomer with a trans/cis molar ratio of 86:14. Furthermore, the peaks associated with the enantiotopic protons Ha (3.40 ppm) of the cis isomer and the diastereotopic protons Hb and Hb′ (3.28 and 2.82 ppm) of the trans isomer are shown in the magnification of Fig. 1a. The C60 monoadduct/bithienyl moieties mean that the molar ratios of the copolymers 5a–c were determined considering the portion of the spectra between 2.5 and 3.5 ppm (see magnification in Fig. 1b). In this region at 2.82 ppm there is overlapping of the signals belonging to one of the diastereotopic protons of the trans isomer, namely Hb′ (see above), and the α-methylene protons of the hexyl chain in the oligothiophene moiety (compare magnifications in Fig. 1a and b). Therefore, because of this overlapping, the different contributions arising from the fulleropyrrolidine monomer and those from the bithienyl moieties were discriminated to determine with accuracy the mean molar ratio of the C60 monoadduct/bithienyl moieties. In this way, it was possible to calculate a C60 derivative/bithienyl moiety mean molar ratio of 1:4.5, 1:8.5, and 1:18.2 for copolymers 5a–c, respectively.

Additionally, it was possible to estimate the regioregularity values of the different copolymers 5a–c, determined as the relative ratio of Head-to-Tail (HT) to non-HT couplings, by comparing the integrated areas of the peaks centered at 2.82 and 2.60 ppm corresponding to α-methylene protons of the hexyl chains in HT and Head-to-Head (HH) linkages, respectively.72,73 The calculated regioregularity values were 84, 86 and 89% for copolymers 5a–c, respectively.
The analysis of copolymers 5a–c by means of FT-IR spectroscopy showed how the IR bands at 527 and 691 cm−1, associated with the fulleropyrrolidine monomer74,75 (purple box; Fig. 1c), decrease their relative intensity compared to the bands associated with the oligothiophenic moiety (yellow boxes; Fig. 1c), passing from copolymers 5a to 5c. These results confirm the same trend obtained by NMR analysis.
The UV-vis spectrum of compound 3 recorded in chloroform is reported in the inset of Fig. 1d. Two major bands are clearly discernible at 254 and 322 nm. In addition, a sharp band at 428 nm and a broader band at 700 nm, typical of fullerene C60-monoadducts at the [6,6] junction,76,77 are also visible. The UV-vis spectra of copolymers 5a–c show the same transitions of compound 3 at 254 and 322 nm. The intensities of such bands are directly proportional to the content of the C60 derivative in the copolymers (Fig. 1d). Additionally, UV-vis spectra of copolymers 5a–c are characterized by the presence of a third band, associated with the conjugated oligothiophenic chain, which shows a redshift from 428 to 442 nm passing from the shorter oligothiophenic chain of copolymer 5a to the longer one of copolymer 5c due to the increased extension of the conjugation.
In addition, the electrochemical behavior of both compound 3 and copolymers 5a–c was analyzed by means of cyclic voltammetry (CV) (see Fig. S4 and Table S1†). The cyclic voltammogram of compound 3 shows four reduction peaks, typical of the fullerene C60 derivatives. These reduction peaks, with the exception of the fourth one, are also detected in the cyclic voltammograms of copolymers 5a–c, whereas the new voltammetric contributions at positive potentials are attributed to the oligothiophenic chains, as it is possible to deduce by comparing the cyclic voltammograms of copolymers 5a–c with that of pure P3HT (Fig. S4b–e†). Moreover, the cyclic voltammogram of pure P3HT shows the presence of a broad reduction peak at −1.81 V, which is also detected in the cyclic voltammograms of copolymers 5a–c, with the relative intensities in agreement with the length of the oligothiophenic moiety. Conversely, regarding the oxidation peaks, it is worth noting that passing from copolymer 5a to 5c, the intensity of these peaks increases while showing onsets of oxidation with ever less positive redox potentials, which results in higher HOMO energy levels (see below), in accordance with the increasing oligothiophenic chain length (Table S1†).


Thin films of copolymers 5a–c. 
The synthesized copolymers have been investigated also in the solid state by performing spin-coating of thin films onto flexible ITO/PET substrates. Quantitative XPS analysis is in agreement with the chemical structure of 5a–c.
Indeed, the relative S and N abundances showed results analogous to the C60 derivative/bithienyl molar ratios observed in NMR; 5a showed a S/N ratio of 16 (the 1:4.5 ratio of the C60 derivative with respect to the bithienyl units above observed by NMR corresponds to a 13:1 S/N ratio) while for 5b and 5c, S/N ratios of 22 and 41, respectively, (expected 21 and 40.4) were found. The N 1s and S 2p spectra show a single species (aminic N and thienyl S) while in the C 1s spectra it is possible to observe two energy loss features (shake-up and/or π–π* transition features) around 287.5 eV and 290.2 eV.
Also, UV-vis spectra of the thin films of the different copolymers were collected to evaluate the aggregation state of the oligothiophenic chains and their optical properties (Fig. S5†). Again, as seen in solution, normalized spectra show that the peak height ratio of poly-3-hexylthiophene (between 450 and 510 nm) and fullerene (325 nm) units is consistent with their stoichiometric amount.
The spin-coated films of 5a, 5b and 5c exhibit a large red shift with maxima located at 456, 480 and 508 nm, respectively, compared to those in solution (Fig. S5†). This phenomenon is attributed to the formation of a π-stacked structure in the solid state. Again, the clear trend observed going from 5a to 5c is likely attributed to the increased extension of the conjugation.


Thin films of P3HT:PCBM:5a–c BHJs. 
The copolymers 5a–c have been studied as compatibilizers for photovoltaic thin films of P3HT:PCBM BHJs.
As a first finding, the regioregularity of the copolymer oligothiophenic chains affects the packing and consequently the π–π stacking of P3HT in thin films. Indeed, XRD spectra show that the addition of a small amount of copolymers 5a–c (2 wt%) in P3HT thin films can lead to a significant alteration of their structure so that the diffraction signal from the (100) plane completely disappears (Fig. 2).
 Fig. 2  X-ray diffraction data of P3HT films with and without copolymer 5b, before (solid lines) and after thermal annealing (dashed lines). 
Interestingly, after thermal annealing at 110 °C for 5 min, both P3HT thin films with and without the copolymers show a diffraction signal at 2θ = 5.5°. The absence of any shift of the diffraction peak position suggests that the lamellar spacing is not altered by the copolymer addition. However, the annealed P3HT thin film resulted in a more intense diffraction signal as compared to that processed with the copolymers, suggesting a decreased crystallinity of P3HT when mixed with these systems. It is important to point out that the photovoltaic properties of the active layer are strongly dependent on good mixing of the donor and acceptor materials and on nanophase separation during the post-fabrication treatment process. The highest crystallinity after thermal annealing does not necessarily imply a good performance of the solar cell devices, because it may be due to an increased number of crystals with excessive size.
Indeed, a decreased crystallinity with adding the copolymers, may be consistent with a reduced phase separation of the donor and acceptor, which leads to thinner interpenetrating networks of the blend layers.67
This view is confirmed by AFM analysis of annealed (110 °C, 5 min) P3HT:PCBM BHJ thin films (Fig. 3) showing a different morphology and a modulation of the domain size triggered by the insertion of the copolymers. In particular, in Fig. 3a and c, the surface morphology of BHJs without and with the copolymer 5b (2 wt%) is reported. According to the literature,17 these samples are characterized by globular (PCBM) and fiber-like features (P3HT). These structures assemble with size visibly smaller for the BHJ with the copolymer. Indeed, the BHJ without the copolymer as shown in Fig. 3a has a RMS surface roughness of 0.86 nm whereas the BHJ with the copolymer 5b shows a reduced value of 0.43 nm. The size difference appears even more evident in the phase-lag images (Fig. 3b and d), where P3HT and PCBM domains give, respectively, bright and dark contrast. By a statistical analysis of these images, the size distribution for the P3HT domains is extracted for the BHJ without and with the copolymer. In the case of the BHJ without the copolymer, the structural size distribution extends over 30 nm and has a mean value of 12.5 nm.
 Fig. 3  AFM analysis of the thin film BHJ deposited without (upper row) and with (lower row) 5b copolymer (2 wt%), after annealing at 110 °C for 5 minutes: (a and c) morphology; (b and d) phase-lag images; (e) P3HT domain size distributions. 
On the other side, the BHJ with copolymer 5b displays a distribution with an overall downshift and a mean value of 10.6 nm. As a general trend (Fig. 3e), AFM reveals that by employing copolymers 5a–c the domain size decreases. In particular, the smallest values are given by using copolymer 5a, i.e. with the shorter oligothiophenic chains, while by employing 5b and 5c the domain size becomes increasingly larger with respect to 5a.
Furthermore, such an effect appears to be enhanced by annealing the BHJ samples with additives at higher temperatures and longer times (120 °C, 10 min) indicating that copolymers may act as nucleation seeds able to modulate the domain size in the heterojunctions.
In order to investigate more deeply the copolymer addition effect into the thin film BHJ, we performed photoluminescence (PL) measurements (Fig. 4). As expected, all samples show a significant PL quenching due to efficient charge transfer from the donor P3HT to the acceptor PCBM, suggesting a good mixing between these materials. In particular, after thermal annealing at 110 °C and 120 °C the PL intensity of pristine BHJs increases significantly due to the phase separation leading to the formation of P3HT domains with increasing sizes, larger than the EDL.17,78 In contrast, BHJs with 5a and 5b show a further improvement of PL quenching even after annealing at high temperatures, whereas the BHJ with 5c shows a slight enhancement of PL intensity after thermal annealing at 110 °C that becomes more pronounced as the temperature increases, seemingly to the pristine BHJ.

This is in agreement with AFM images and with the picture in Fig. 5 where the presence of copolymers modulates the domain size along with the phase separation process. In particular, Fig. 5 shows that this size modulation effect is more likely due to the structurally related interaction of the copolymer oligothiophene and fullerene moieties with the donor P3HT and acceptor PCBM structures, respectively. Thus, the shorter chain of copolymers 5a–b causes PL quenching under annealing in agreement with the formation of a large number of small domains allowing for charge separation processes, i.e. with sizes comparable to the EDL. Contrariwise, the presence of 5c, with longer oligothiophenic chains, leads to significantly higher PL intensity in agreement with a phase separation with domains largely exceeding the P3HT EDL.17,78
 Fig. 5  Schematic representation of the effect of the three copolymers on the domain size distribution in a BHJ. 
Indeed, with regard to the length of the repetitive units of copolymers 5a–c, the oligothiophenic chains can be estimated to be about 5 nm, 8 nm and 15 nm, respectively. Interestingly, the EDL in regioregular P3HT thin films is 6–10 nm17,79–81 and the exciton dissociation appears to be more efficient for the BHJ with the copolymers (5a and 5b) with the oligothiophenic chains in that length range.
This result is consistent with the above AFM features showing P3HT domains in an average of about 10 nm with the employment of the copolymer 5b, whereas these domains appear smaller and larger upon employing copolymers 5a and 5c, respectively. Thus the length of oligothiophenic chains in the copolymers plays a key role in the mixing and/or in the phase separation process under thermal annealing.
Cyclic voltammetry measurements have also been used in order to evaluate the energy level of the three copolymers (see Tables S1 and S2†). Fig. 6 shows the schematic diagram representing calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels of copolymers 5a–c, compared with those of PCBM and P3HT. The HOMO and LUMO levels of the copolymers are positioned between the energy level of P3HT and PCBM to form a cascade energy structure that should improve the charge transfer process.82–84 A slight increase in the HOMO energy level with increasing content of thiophene units has been observed in the literature.85,86 Contrariwise, the LUMO levels do not follow a particular trend.

However, unlike many copolymers reported in the literature, in which the repetitive units usually include insulating linkers that affect the electronic properties of the BHJ, these copolymers show good photovoltaic properties. Indeed, in order to demonstrate the cascade energy structure, current–voltage measurements have been performed on bi-component OSCs, consisting only of donor and acceptor materials, where the copolymers have been employed as n-type or p-type systems (Tables S3–S5†). All copolymers are shown to be able to act as p-type when coupled with a PCBM and as n-type when coupled with P3HT, thus confirming the position of energy level values obtained by cyclic voltammetry measurements. In particular, both copolymers show better photovoltaic parameters by acting as donor systems (p-type), as a consequence of the predominance of the oligothiophenic units compared to the fullerene units. For the same reason, the copolymer 5c with longer oligothiophenic chains exhibits better values of JSC (2.74 mA cm−2), VOC (0.80 V) and PCE (0.67%) when coupled with a PCBM. In addition, in order to further evaluate the electrical properties of different copolymers, single layer OSCs without P3HT and PCBM have been realized and tested. Indeed, these copolymers can be considered as “push–pull” systems with electron acceptor moieties (fullerene units) directly linked to donor conjugates (oligothiophenic chains). Again, the device with the copolymer 5b shows higher JSC and PCE values than those containing copolymers 5a and 5c, suggesting better electrical properties.

Effect of the copolymers on the performances of P3HT:PCBM BHJ solar cells
On the basis of the above results, we studied the effect of the copolymers 5a–c added to the P3HT:PCBM active layer of plastic OSCs with a Al/LiF/P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/ITO/PET architecture. Fig. 7 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the plastic OSCs with and without copolymers 5a–c. The corresponding open circuit voltage (VOC), JSC, fill factor (FF) and PCE values are summarized in Table 1.

Before annealing, the OSC without additives exhibits a PCE of 1.63% with a JSC of 7.71 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.63 V, and FF of 0.34. Electrical measurements with increasing amounts of copolymers 5a–c reveal that addition of just 2 wt% of copolymers strongly affects the photovoltaic performances of the devices (for details about the effect of different amounts of the copolymers, see Tables S6–S8†). In the presence of 5a, the PCE value decreases to 1.24% due to a decrement of JSC (5.22 mA cm−2), although both VOC and FF values are slightly improved (0.68 and 0.35 V, respectively). This lower JSC together with the above PL quenching data suggest that copolymer 5a induces the formation of a large number of confined domains resulting in an efficient donor/acceptor charge transfer but limited charge percolation paths to the electrodes. Instead, OSCs with 5b and 5c show improved performances with PCE values increased to 2.38% and 1.83%, respectively. The lower value obtained with 5c can be ascribed to the decrease of JSC (6.07 mA cm−2), thus confirming the above hypothesis that longer oligothiophenic chains in the copolymer lead to a phase separation with domains significantly exceeding the P3HT EDL.
Despite this, the PCE value of OSCs with 5c is greater than that without copolymers, thanks to the higher FF (0.46).
Generally, low values of JSC and high values of FF are a good indication that the domain size in the active layer is unsuitable for exciton dissociation but, at the same time, adequate for an efficient charge transport.31,87,88 Instead, the domain size obtained with 5b likely ensures an appropriate balance between exciton dissociation and charge percolation to the electrodes. Indeed, in this case both JSC and FF show an increase to 8.47 mA cm−2 and 0.45 respectively, showing the best performance among all the different devices. The difference between OSCs with and without copolymers 5a–c becomes even more pronounced when the devices are exposed to thermal annealing at 110 °C for 5 minutes, since all the solar cells show enhanced PCE values.
In particular, in agreement with the literature, the device without copolymers show an increased JSC from 7.71 mA cm−2 to 9.52 mA cm−2 resulting in a PCE of 1.97%.89,90 Even better results are obtained by annealing the OSCs with copolymers 5b and 5c showing JSC values significantly increased from 8.47 mA cm−2 and 6.07 mA cm−2 to 14.67 mA cm−2 and 13.90 mA cm−2, respectively. Thanks to this JSC enhancement, the PCE of all the OSCs with 5a–c copolymers becomes higher under this annealing process.
Interestingly, even the OSC with 5a exhibits a PCE (2.07%) higher than the reference device due to the remarkable improvement of JSC to 10.30 mA cm−2, almost double with respect to the non-annealed device. The other parameters, VOC and FF, in agreement with the literature, decrease or remain unchanged.89,90
This is in agreement with the above-mentioned picture (Fig. 5) where the presence of copolymers induces a good mixing between P3HT and PCBM, resulting in a better nano-phase separation under annealing that is regulated by the length of oligothiophenic chains.
In order to further investigate this effect of the copolymers on the performance of the BHJ OSCs, J–V measurements were performed on devices annealed at a higher temperature (120 °C) for 10 minutes. In agreement with the PL spectra, this higher annealing temperature worsens the performance of the OSC without copolymers (PCE 0.82%), which is ascribed again to the larger phase separation process leading to domains with sizes significantly exceeding the EDL. Seemingly, the PCE value of the OSCs with 5c decreases from 3.84% to 1.36%. In contrast, this higher annealing temperature further improves the performances of both OSCs with 5a and 5b, resulting in PCE values of 2.40% and 4.46% respectively. Again, these results are in perfect agreement with PL measurements showing that using these two copolymers a limited phase separation process on the EDL scale with an improved charge percolation path continuity is achieved.
Note that 4.46% obtained by employing copolymer 5b is the best PCE value ever reported for P3HT:PCBM OSCs on a plastic substrate, with the previous data giving a PCE of about 2% that is significantly lower than OSCs on glass substrates (about 6%)23,24 due to the higher surface resistivity of the electrode in contact with the plastic substrate and the lower light transparency of the plastic itself.22–25
The best PCE value obtained with copolymer 5b is again ascribed to the length of its oligothiophenic chain that is between those of copolymer 5a (too short to ensure percolation path continuity) and copolymer 5c (too long to limit the domain size).
Finally, to further explore their potential employment in flexible devices, bending tests were performed on samples with and without copolymers. Fig. 8 shows the normalized photovoltaic parameters as a function of the number of bending cycles when the films were subjected to bending radii of 18 and 8 mm. Both devices exhibit a good bending stability after 110 bending cycles, demonstrating the excellent ductility of the organic active layers. However, the reference device shows a decrease of about 10% and 16% of the original PCE at 18 and 8 mm, respectively. Contrariwise, all the photovoltaic parameters of device with copolymer 5b remain almost unchanged (<5%) at both bending radii. Only the PCE undergoes a slight decrease of 9% when the device is bent to a radius of 8 mm, indicating higher stability compared to the reference device.

The OSCs with copolymers maintain this high level of performance likely due to the smaller nanoscale domains, that limit particle cracking during the bending.
Conclusions
By employing a simple, easy and inexpensive one-step synthetic approach a class of new copolymers alternating the main units of typical donor (polythiophenes) and acceptor (fullerenes) systems employed in OSCs has been synthesized. Small quantities of these copolymers are able to tune the morphology of P3HT:PCBM BHJs, by limiting under thermal annealing the phase separation of the donor and acceptor systems. These copolymers act more likely as nucleation seeds enabling control of the domain size on the P3HT EDL scale by modulating the size of the structures in the heterojunction through the structurally related interaction of their oligothiophenic chains with the donor P3HT and of their fullerene moieties with the acceptor PCBM. In addition, a good matching of the energy levels has been observed, so that the HOMO and the LUMO levels of the donor and acceptor materials form a cascade energy band structure. Our strategy turned out to be well suited to realize an organic P3HT:PCBM solar cell showing record PCE on plastic substrates. Thus these results have great potential for the improvement of organic solar cell performances paving the way for an extended use of the cheap P3HT as a donor in large area devices. Future work will be focused on designing copolymers containing units of the more recent top-performer donor and acceptor molecules.91–93
