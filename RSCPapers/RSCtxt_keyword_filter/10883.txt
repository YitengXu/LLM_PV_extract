    , Accepted 25th April 2015First published on 28th April 2015AbstractLead halide perovskite solar cells have attracted great interest due to their high efficiency and simple fabrication process. However, the high efficiency heavily relies on expensive organic hole-transporting materials (OHTMs) such as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD), it is preferable to replace these expensive OHTMs by inorganic and low cost materials. Here, we report colloidal PbS quantum dots synthesized by a facile method and used as the inorganic hole-transporting material in a hybrid perovskite solar cell. By controlling the crystalline morphology of the perovskite capping layer, the recombination process is significantly retarded. Furthermore, a pure inorganic solar cell prepared by a two-step process demonstrated a nearly 8% power conversion efficiency due to efficient charge separation by a cascade of junctions and retarding charge recombination by a void-free capping layer. The stability of the inorganic solar cell was also tested with a little decay observed within ca. 100 h.
1. Introduction
Recently, lead halide perovskite (CH3NH3PbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) materials have attracted substantial attention as excellent light absorbers in thin film photovoltaic applications due to these exceptional advantages, including a large absorption coefficient, direct band gap absorption, high charge carrier mobility and long diffusion lengths.1–6 In addition, they are composed of earth-abundant materials and can be prepared by low-temperature solution chemical methods.3,7,8 Miyasaka and co-workers were the first to report CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Br, I)-based solar cells using a liquid electrolyte in 2009 with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2–4%.1 In 2012, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) was introduced as an organic hole-transporting material (OHTM) for replacing problematic electrolytes and the solid state perovskite solar cell achieved an efficiency of ∼10%.2 A certified efficiency of about 20% has very recently been achieved, demonstrating the great potential of perovskite solar cells for solar energy conversion.9
Despite the remarkable achievement in perovskite solar cells, there are concerns about the cost of the frequently used OHTMs which are either small molecules, e.g. spiro-MeOTAD or conducting polymer molecules, e.g. polytriarylamine (PTAA), poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) and poly[N-9-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-3,6-bis-(thiophen-5-yl)-2,5-dioctyl-2,5-di-hydropyrrolo[3,4-]pyrrole-1,4-dione] (PCBTDPP).10–13 Furthermore, these HTMs used are normally quite expensive due to complicated synthetic procedures or high-purity requirement, thus limiting these materials’ large-scale application in perovskite solar cells and raising concern about the reproducibility of the solar cells. Inorganic HTMs have the advantages of better stability, the ease of synthesis and low cost. Copper iodide (CuI) and copper thiocyanate (CuSCN) as effective HTMs have been applied in perovskite solar cells with the reported efficiency of 6% and 12.4%, respectively.14,15 However, manufacturing complexities for the inorganic thin films again hinder their large-scale application in perovskite solar cells.
PbS colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are among the most intensively studied low band gap semiconductor nanocrystals owing to their high absorption coefficient, a wide range of tunable band gaps due to their large Bohr exciton radius of 18 nm and the multiple exciton generation effect.16–18 By engineering the band alignment of the PbS QD layers through the use of different ligand treatments, rapid progress has been made in PbS solar cells (where PbS QDs are the only light absorber) with a certified efficiency of 8.55%.19 Recently, someone also tried to use PbS QDs in perovskite solar cells. Seok and his colleagues20 fabricated PbS/CH3NH3PbI3 core/shell QD-sensitized heterojunction solar cells. Etgar et al.21 reported the co-sensitization phenomenon between CH3NH3PbI3 and PbS QDs in a heterojunction solar cell. However, low efficiency of less than 4% was reported for those PbS QD perovskite heterojunction solar cells. In this work, a two-step process was applied to prepare a CH3NH3PbI3 layer and use PbS QDs as inorganic HTMs. The influence of the crystalline morphology of the CH3NH3PbI3 capping layer on the recombination resistance was investigated and the solvent effect on the energy conversion efficiency was also discussed. Finally the stability of the pure inorganic solar cell was monitored.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Lead(II) iodide (PbI2, 99%), lead(II) chloride (PbCl2, 99.999%), lead(II) oxide (PbO, 99%), titanium isopropoxide (97%), lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl) imide (Li-TFSI) (99.95%), 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP, 96%), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.9%), oleic acid (98%), 1-octadecene (90%), hydriodic acid (57 wt% in water) and hexamethyldisilathiane (TMS2-S) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Methylamine solution (40% in methanol) was purchased from TCI. Spiro-MeOTAD was purchased from Merck KGaA. All chemicals were used as received.
2.2 Synthesis

2.2.1 Synthesis of colloidal PbS QDs. 
The synthesis of oleic-acid-capped PbS QDs with a first absorption peak at 907 nm was adapted from the literature.19,22,23 The lead precursor was prepared by dissolving and degassing 0.45 g of PbO in a mixture of 1.5 mL of oleic acid and 18 mL of 1-octadecene at 100 °C for 5 h, until all of the reagents completely dissolved and formed a clear solution. Then the solution was cooled down to 80 °C under the argon flow and intense stirring, followed by the swift injection of the sulfur precursor formed with 215 μl of TMS2-S and 10 mL of 1-octadecene. The reaction mixture was additionally stirred for 30 s at 80 °C, and then the reaction mixture was cooled down to 40 °C with ice water. After synthesis, the QDs were purified and extracted. Finally, the PbS QDs were stored as a powder in the glove box.


2.2.2 Synthesis of CH3NH3I. 
CH3NH3I was synthesized according to the reported method.24 A hydriodic acid (30 mL, 57 wt% in water) was reacted with methylamine (27.86 mL, 40% in methanol) in a 250 mL round-bottom flask at 0 °C for 2 h. The precipitate was recovered by putting the solution on a rotary evaporator and carefully removing the solvent at 50 °C for 1 h. The generated yellowish powder was dissolved in ethanol, recrystallized from diethyl ether, and finally dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h.

2.3 Solar cell fabrication
Substrate preparation: fluorine-doped tin oxide (TEC, 15 Ω per square) coated glass substrates with dimensions of 2 cm × 1.5 cm were patterned by etching with Zn powder and 2 M HCl diluted in water. The etched substrates were cleaned with a detergent, ultrasonicated in pure water and ethanol for 30 min, rinsed with deionized water and ethanol, and then dried in air. Finally, the substrates were annealed at 500 °C for 30 min.
A dense blocking layer of TiO2 (bl-TiO2) was spin-coated on a FTO substrate at 2000 rpm for 30 s using a mildly acidic solution of titanium isopropoxide prepared according to a reported method,25 and then annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. The mesoporous TiO2 layer was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 30 s onto the FTO/bl-TiO2 substrate using a commercial TiO2 paste (Dyesol18NRT, Dyesol) diluted in ethanol (1:3.5, weight ratio). After drying at 50 °C, the TiO2 films were annealed at 500 °C for 30 min to remove the organic part. After cooling to room temperature, the TiO2 films were treated in a 0.04 M aqueous solution of TiCl4 at 60 °C for 1 h, rinsed with deionized water and annealed at 500 °C for 30 min.
The deposition process of perovskites on the mesoporous TiO2 films includes one-step and two-step methods. For the one-step method of preparing CH3NH3PbI3, a 40 wt% DMF solution of CH3NH3I and PbCl2 (3:1 molar ratio) was spanned on the mesoporous TiO2 films at a speed of 3000 rpm for 30 s and the perovskite was formed after heating to 100 °C for 30 minutes. For the two-step method, 462 mg PbI2 was dissolved in 1 ml N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) under stirring at 70 °C overnight, followed by filtering with a 0.22 μm pore PVDF syringe filter. The solution was kept at 70 °C during the whole procedure. A 40 μL PbI2 solution was spin-coated on the mesoporous TiO2 films at 3000 rpm for 20 s, and dried at 50 °C for 3 min and 100 °C for 5 min consecutively. After cooling to room temperature, 100 μL of CH3NH3I solution in 2-propanol (10 mg ml−1) was loaded on the PbI2-coated TiO2 films for 20 s, which was spun at 4000 rpm for 30 s and then dried at 100 °C for 5 min.
The composition of PbS QD HTM was 10 mg PbS QDs in 1 ml octane. The PbS QDs were deposited on the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 film by spin coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The composition of spiro-MeOTAD HTM was 72.3 mg spiro-MeOTAD, 28.8 μl TBP, and 17.5 μl of a solution of 520 mg ml−1 LiTFSI in acetonitrile in 1 ml chlorobenzene. The spiro-MeOTAD was deposited on the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 film by spin coating at 4000 rpm for 30 s.
Finally, 60 nm-thick Au was thermally evaporated on top of the device to form the back contact. The active area of devices was 9 mm2 determined by a black mask with dimensions of 3 mm × 3 mm.
2.4 Characterization
The surface morphology of the film was observed with a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, sirion200, FEI Corp., Holland). The TEM images were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL-2010, Japan). The UV–vis spectrum of the films was obtained using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (U-3900H, HITACHI, Japan). The current–voltage characteristics (J–V curves) were measured with a Keithley model 2420 digital source meter (Keithley Instruments, Inc., OH) under the illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5) provided by a solar simulator (solar AAA simulator, Oriel, USA). The incident-photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement was conducted using a QE/IPCE measurement kit (Newport Corporation, CA). Impedance spectra were recorded with an electrochemical analyzer (Autolab 320, Metrohm, Switzerland) at varying bias potentials from 0 V to 0.8 V where the potential step is 0.1 V. AC 20 mV perturbation was applied with a frequency from 1 MHz to 1 Hz. The obtained impedance spectra were fitted with ZView software (v2.8b, Scribner Associates, USA). The Nyquist plots and the best fit results are based on an equivalent circuit (Fig. 6).
3. Results and discussion
The oleic-acid-capped PbS QDs were synthesized according to the hot injecting method.22 The first exciton absorption peak of the oleic-acid-capped PbS QDs was measured at 904 nm, which corresponds to an optical bandgap Eg = 1.37 eV, as shown in Fig. 1a. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Fig. 1b) suggests that the PbS nanocrystals are highly crystalline and have an average diameter of 3.6 nm. Fig. 2a represents the band positions of the different layers in the perovskite solar cell,2,18 which indicates that the excited electrons can vectorially transfer from PbS to CH3NH3PbI3 and then TiO2 and the excited holes move along the opposite direction, thus photogenerated electrons and holes are separated spatially.

The morphology of the deposited CH3NH3PbI3 has been reported to be critical for the photovoltaic performance of the perovskite solar cells. Different methods have been used for the CH3NH3PbI3 layer fabrication in perovskite solar cells, leading to different efficiencies.26–28 We fabricated the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite on the mesoporous TiO2 films using traditional one-step (without using gas or toluene assisted methods26,29) and two-step methods, as shown in Fig. 2b. For the one-step spin-coating procedure of preparing CH3NH3PbI3, two precursors PbCl2 and CH3NH3I were first mixed in an N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution, and then spin-coated on the mesoporous TiO2 films. For the two-step method, the mesoporous TiO2 film was first infiltrated with a PbI2-dissolved DMF solution by spin coating, and then a CH3NH3I-dissolved isopropyl alcohol (IPA) solution was spin-coated on the TiO2/PbI2 films.
From Fig. 3a and b one can see that morphologies of the deposited CH3NH3PbI3 on the mesoporous TiO2 films are completely different due to different preparation procedures. One-step coating produces a shapeless CH3NH3PbI3 layer on the surface of the TiO2 films (Fig. 3a), whereas the two-step method leads to the formation of CH3NH3PbI3 cuboids on the TiO2 films shown in Fig. 3b. Besides the morphological difference, the TiO2 layer is not completely covered by CH3NH3PbI3 using a one-step method compared to full coverage with CH3NH3PbI3 cuboids by a two-step method, which will affect recombination of electrons in TiO2 and holes in PbS QDs as discussed later. After spinning a colloidal PbS QD octane solution, top view and cross-sectional SEM images confirm that PbS QDs have been relatively homogenously deposited on the surface of the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 film, therefore the void-free CH3NH3PbI3 cuboid capping layer would effectively inhibit the contact between PbS QDs and the bottom mesoporous TiO2 layer in the cell prepared by the two-step method. The thickness of the CH3NH3PbI3 capping layer made by the two-step method is around 200 nm, as seen in Fig. 3f. It is apparent that the surfaces of CH3NH3PbI3 are smoothed by filling with the PbS QDs, resulting in a smoother plat Au film.

Cross-sectional SEM images of the devices for (e) one-step method and (f) two-step method. The structures of the devices are FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/PbS/Au. The mesoporous TiO2 film thickness is about 300 nm and the thickness of the CH3NH3PbI3 capping layer made by the two-step method is around 200 nm. 
Because PbS QDs exhibit near-infrared absorption, some studies have reported hybrid CH3NH3PbI3/PbS solar cells with impressive Jsc due to the extended absorption. We investigated the optical absorption of the devices prepared herein. Fig. 4 shows the absorption spectra of the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 and the CH3NH3PbI3 + PbS QDs on TiO2 films prepared using the two-step method. The absorption of the CH3NH3PbI3 goes only up to 800 nm wavelength owing to its bandgap of 1.57 eV. Although the PbS QDs have an absorption in the near-infrared region as can be seen in Fig. 1a, the absorption of the CH3NH3PbI3 + PbS QDs shows little contribution from PbS QDs at the near-infrared wavelength. The PbS layer's thickness is assumed to be less than 30 nm due to the low concentration PbS QD solution (10 mg mL−1) and the fast spinning speed (3000 rpm), Compared with other literature reports20,21,30 this weak absorption contribution of the PbS QDs is reasonable. Likewise, little contribution of PbS QDs to the absorption is observed for the perovskite solar cell prepared by the one-step method, as seen in Fig. S1.†

The photovoltaic performance of the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/PbS solar cells based on one-step and two-step methods was evaluated. Firstly the dependence of photovoltaic performance on the spin-coating number of PbS was investigated at the given PbS QD concentration of 10 mg mL−1 in octane and the given TiO2 thickness of 300 nm (Fig. 3e and f). The coating time for the optimized solar cells was found to be 2 times for the one-step method and 1 time for the two-step method (ESI Fig. S2 and S3 and Tables S1 and S2†). In the case of the device based on the one-step method for CH3NH3PbI3 formation, the PCE of CH3NH3PbI3/PbS solar cells is significantly improved from 3.50% to 4.73% (35% increment) after spinning 2 times PbS QDs, which is mainly due to the increase in Voc from 601 mV to 636 mV and Jsc from 12.49 mA cm−2 to 14.17 mA cm−2. Furthermore, in the case of the device based on the two-step method, PCE of CH3NH3PbI3/PbS solar cells is substantially improved from 5.53% to 7.88% (43% increment) after spin-coating 1 time PbS, which is mainly due to the remarkable increase in Voc from 761 mV to 868 mV (14% increment) and Jsc from 16.78 mA cm−2 to 18.69 mA cm−2 (11% increment). With further increasing spin-coating number from 1 time to 4 times, no significant change in Voc is observed, whereas Jsc is gradually decreased. One reason is further increase of the HTM thickness would increase the hole transfer pathway, leading to an enhanced charge recombination but no contribution to light absorption (ESI Fig. S4†). Another reason resulting in decreased Jsc is related to the influence of the octane solvent on CH3NH3PbI3. The surface SEM images of the two-step method fabricated CH3NH3PbI3 cuboids layer before and after spin-coating the neat octane solvent are shown in Fig. S5.† After spinning the octane solvent, the apparent size and shape of these cuboids are not obviously influenced. However, the photovoltaic performances of CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells decrease after spinning the solvent. In order to find out the reason and comparing the new solar cell with the benchmark solar cell, we prepared a solar cell using the widely reported spiro-MeOTAD as HTM. The reproducible PCE shown in Fig. S6 and Table S3† is 11.11%. As can be seen in Table S3,† the pretreatment of the solar cell with different solvents before coating spiro-MeOTAD HTM decreases the performance of a solar cell. We used octane as the solvent for PbS coating, which has a detrimental effect on the solar cell, which may be due to the change of the surface state of CH3NH3PbI3, leading to weak interactions between CH3NH3PbI3 and PbS. However the detailed reason is not clear and is under investigation. Finally the optimized solar cells fabricated by one step and two step methods were characterized and are shown in Fig. 5a and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The best solar cell was fabricated by the two step method with PbS QDs as an inorganic HTM, leading to a PCE of 7.88%. The optimized solar cell fabricated by the one step method gives a PEC of 4.7%, which is similar to the very recently reported 4% achieved by a similar configuration of the solar cell,20 indicating that our experimental conditions are reliable. The nearly 70% enhancement in PCE is due to the morphology change of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer. The two step method as mentioned above gives a condense layer of CH3NH3PbI3 cuboids, which physically separate the PbS HTM layer from the TiO2 electron transfer layer, leading to reduction of the charge recombination. The IPCE spectra of the perovskite solar cells with PbS as HTM were recorded and shown in Fig. 5b. As can be seen, there was no further extended absorption peak for CH3NH3PbI3/PbS solar cells at the near-infrared wavelength due to the slight amount of PbS QDs on the surface of CH3NH3PbI3 films, as mentioned above.

We employed impedance spectroscopy (IS) to investigate the factors responsible for the different voltages (636 mV vs. 868 mV) in TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/PbS solar cells prepared by the one-step and two-step methods, as shown in Fig. 6. The recombination resistance (Rrec) is obtained from impedance spectra where the first arc in the high frequency region is related to transport in HTM21 and the second arc is related to the recombination between TiO2 and HTMs.22,23 The two arcs are fitted using a simplified equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 6d and the resulting Rrec is plotted as a function of applied bias voltage in Fig. 6c. Rrec decreases exponentially for both one-step and two-step methods with the increasing bias voltage. Rrec for solar cells prepared by the one-step method shows a lower value than that by the two-step method as the applied bias voltage increases, which indicates that recombination in the device based on the one-step method is faster compared to two-step method based devices. Thus, the solar cells prepared by a one-step method represent a lower open-circuit voltage due to higher recombination. Likewise, the two-step perovskite solar cell shows lower recombination kinetics due to its well established free-void perovskite layer to prevent the PbS QD infiltration and thus a decrease in the charge recombination, leading to 230 mV higher Voc and 4.5 mA cm−2 higher Jsc than the solar cell prepared by the one-step method. The stability of the best solar cell was also investigated, which is one of the key factors determining the practical application of the perovskite solar cells. As seen in Table 2, the best solar cell almost retains its performance after day 2 with 8% decay compared with the fresh solar cell.

4. Conclusions
In summary, colloidal PbS QDs prepared by a facile method have been successfully introduced in mesoporous perovskite solar cells as inorganic hole-transporting materials. The device based on the two-step method exhibits 70% higher power conversion efficiency than the one-step method, resulting from the denser perovskite capping layer on the surface of mesoporous TiO2 films. Impedance spectroscopy suggests that the compact crystalline morphology of the CH3NH3PbI3 capping layer significantly retarded the recombination process between electrons in TiO2 and holes in HTM. By optimizing the thickness of PbS QDs, the perovskite solar cells based on PbS QD HTM achieved a power conversion efficiency of nearly 8% with a relatively good stability. These results indicate the efficiency of PbS QDs as a low cost HTM and point out the importance of retarding recombination in a perovskite/QD hybrid solar cell.
