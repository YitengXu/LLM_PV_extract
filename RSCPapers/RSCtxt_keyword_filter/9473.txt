    , Accepted 16th June 2017First published on 16th June 2017AbstractBy using transition-metal (TM) complex cationic dyes as structure-directing agents and photosensitizers, a series of inorganic–organic hybrid metal halides, namely, [TM(2,2′-bipy)3]AgPb2I7 [TM = Ni (1), Co (2) and Zn (3)], [Co(2,2′-bipy)3]CuPb2Br7 (4) and [TM(2,2′-bipy)3]AgPb2Br7 [TM = Ni (5) and Fe (6)], have been solvothermally prepared and structurally characterized. Compounds 1–3 feature 1D [AgPb2I7]2− chains built from the condensation of [Ag2I6] dimers and [Pb4I14] tetramers, and compounds 4, 5 and 6 contain similar 1D [CuPb2Br7]2− and [AgPb2Br7]2− chains, respectively. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance measurements reveal narrow band gaps of 1.75–2.18 eV for compounds 1–6, which lead to efficient and stable photocatalytic degradation activities over organic pollutants under visible light irradiation. Among the title compounds, sample 5 shows the highest photocatalytic degradation activity. The possible mechanism for their stable photocatalytic activities is proposed based on the experimental and theoretical studies.
Introduction
Inorganic–organic hybrid lead halide materials have been intensively investigated not only for their fascinating structural diversities but also for their distinct physical properties inherited from the interactions between inorganic and organic components.1–5 For example, perovskite compound (CH3NH3)PbI3 as a solar cell has revolutionized the prospects of emerging photovoltaic technologies due to its high-power conversion efficiency and easy fabrication.14 Recently, hybrid metal halides based on Bi3+, Sn2+, Ge2+, Cd2+, Ag+, Cu+ and so on, have also been found to display intriguing optical and electronic properties because of band structure decoration,6–13 thus the design and syntheses of such hybrid metal halide materials are attracting much interest.
To date, a large number of hybrid lead halides have been synthesized using various organic counterions, giving diverse anionic Pb–X (X = Cl, Br, I) units, e.g. discrete [Pb5I16]6−, [Pb7I22]8−, [Pb10I28]8−, [Pb18I44]8−, 1D chains or tubes of [Pb2X6]2−, [Pb3X10]4−, [Pb5I12]2−, [Pb18I54(I2)9]18−, 2D layers of [Pb2I8]4−, [Pb7I18]4−, 3D framework of [Pb7I18]4−, [Pb2Cl6]2−, [Pb21Cl59]17−, etc.15–17 Recently, an effective strategy for the development of a new hybrid lead halide is to rationally construct new secondary building units (SBUs) via incorporation of heteroatoms (such as Cu+, Ag+, etc.) into the single metal phases. The introduction of heteroatoms into binary lead halide systems directly modulates the connection modes of PbX6 units and thus forms unusual structural networks. At the same time, the abundant valence electrons of heteroatoms afford more opportunities to regulate the electronic band structures and the photoelectric properties. To this end, only several anionic heterometallic units for the Cu/Ag–Pb–X system have been synthesized and structurally characterized so far, including 1D [Pb3Ag10I22]6−, [MPbI4]−, [M2Pb7I22]6− (M = Cu, Ag), [Ag2Pb2I9]3− chains and a [Cu6Pb3I16]4− layer, as well as some organic ligand coordinated neutral networks of PbCu6I8(PPh3)6, [Cu(phen)]2Cu2Pb3I10 and PbAg2I4(PPh3)2.18 Hence, it is still a greatly attractive and challenging goal to prepare new types of anionic heterometallic lead halide derivatives and understand their structure–property relationships.
Functionally, most hybrid lead halide materials feature narrow band gaps, leading to excellent optical and semiconducting characteristics such as nonlinear-optical, photochromic, luminescence, photovoltaic properties, etc.7,16 As we know, the semiconducting properties of solid state materials are mainly determined by the electronic band structures, which are greatly influenced by the templated organic cations. Therefore, the controllable preparation of functional hybrid lead halides based on a band structure design strategy via a rational selection of templated cations has become an attractive direction in addition to the structural construction. Currently, most hybrid lead halides are templated and directed by alkylammonium or aliphatic organic amine countercations, and some new templates including TM complexes are being introduced into hybrid materials. These TM complex cations occupying the conduction bands of hybrid materials feature excellent electron accepting and transferring capabilities, which not only effectively increase their photochemical stabilities, but also greatly tune their band structures and photoelectric characteristics, such as the rarely studied visible light driven photocatalytic properties.
Intrigued by the rich structural flexibilities and semiconducting photoelectric behavior of these hybrid lead halide materials, we undertook systematic studies for exploring new hybrid heterometallic Cu/Ag–Pb–X systems via incorporation of photosensitive TM complex cations as our continued research work on hybrid metal halide phases to study their bond nature and semiconducting photoelectric properties.19 Fortunately, we prepared a new type of hybrid heterometallic Cu/Ag–Pb–X phase, namely, [TM(2,2-bipy)3]MPb2X7 (TM = Cu, Ag, X = Br, I) containing 1D anionic [MPb2X7]2− chains based on [M2X6] dimers and [Pb4X14] tetramers. The optical gap analyses revealed that all compounds possess narrow band gaps of 1.75–2.18 eV, which lead to the efficient and stable photocatalytic activities under visible light irradiation. Here, we report their syntheses, crystal and electronic band structures, photocatalytic properties as well as the possible photocatalytic mechanism.
Experimental section
Materials and methods
All the analytical grade chemicals employed in this study were commercially available and used without further purification. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data were recorded on a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα, λ = 1.5418 Å) in the 2θ range of 5–80°. Elemental analyses of C, H and N were performed on a PE2400 II elemental analyzer. UV–vis absorption was monitored with a PE Lambda 900 UV/vis spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 200–800 nm. Thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) was performed by using a Mettler TGA/SDTA 851 thermal analyzer under a N2 atmosphere in the temperature range of 30–800 °C.
Preparation of compounds 1–3
A mixture of Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O (0.5 mmol), 2,2-bipy (1.5 mmol), AgI (0.5 mmol), PbI2 (1.2 mmol), KI (2 mmol), HI aqueous solution (1.0 mL, 45%) and acetonitrile (3.0 mL) was sealed in a stainless steel reactor with a 15 mL Teflon liner and heated at 140 °C for 5 days, and then slowly cooled to room temperature. A large amount of dark red and block-shaped crystals of 1 were found with a yield of 41% based on Ag and subsequently determined as [Ni(2,2-bipy)3]AgPb2I7. Compounds 2 and 3 were synthesized in an analogous manner to that of 1 with Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O and Zn(CH3COO)2·4H2O instead of Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O with yields of 21% and 15%, respectively.

Orange block crystals of compound 4 were obtained with a yield of 35% and collected. Adopting similar reaction conditions, pink block-shaped compound 5 was obtained in a yield of 26% with AgBr and Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O to replace CuBr and Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O, respectively, and dark-red block-shaped compound 6 was further synthesized in a yield of 32% with FeSO4·7H2O instead of Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O.

Crystallographic studies
Single crystals of the title compounds were collected on a Bruker SMART CCD-based diffractometer (Mo Kα radiation, λ = 0.71073 Å) at 293(2) K. Data integration and cell refinements were done by using the INTEGRATE program of the APEX2 software, and multi-scan absorption corrections were applied using the SCALE program for an area detector. The structures were solved by the direct method and refined on F2 by the full-matrix least-squares method with the SHELXL program.20 All the non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic thermal parameters, and the hydrogen atoms of organic ligands were generated theoretically onto the specific carbon atoms and refined isotropically with fixed thermal factors. The crystallographic data for all the compounds are listed in Tables 1 and 2 and important bond lengths are listed in Tables S1–S6.† More details on the crystallographic studies are given in the ESI.†

Photocatalytic activity measurements
All the single crystals of 1–6 were collected and ground into powder to study their physical properties. Note that all the powder samples of compounds 1–6 are able to dissolve in water to different extent, and the average solubility of samples 1–6 was calculated to be 0.1633, 0.1401, 0.1533, 0.1802, 0.0805 and 0.9104 mg mL−1, respectively, based on the simple solution experiments. Obviously, compounds 1–5 feature far less solubility than that of compound 6, and the latter can easily dissolve in water with a red color solution. Subsequently, the photocatalytic activities of the as-prepared powder samples 1–5 were evaluated by the degradation of organic pollutants, such as crystal violet (CV), rhodamine B (RhB) and methyl orange (MO) under visible light irradiation. However, the red solution of sample 6 led to great difficulties for analyzing and recollecting the samples. So we did not investigate the photocatalytic activity of sample 6. The simulated sunlight originated from a 50 W Xe lamp and the cut-off filter was used to remove all wavelengths less than 400 nm and more than 780 nm ensuring irradiation with visible-light only. In one photocatalytic activity measurement, 30 mg of each sample of the title compounds was added to 30 mL of 1 × 10−5 mol L−1 solution of CV, RhB and MO, respectively. After being dispersed in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min, the suspensions were further magnetically stirred in the dark for 10 hours before irradiation to ensure absorption equilibrium and uniform decentralization between the catalyst and organic pollutants. The solution was then exposed to visible light irradiation. After a given irradiation time, 4 mL of the mixture was continually taken from the reaction cell and the catalysts were separated from the suspensions by centrifugation. The degradation process was monitored through a wavelength scan on a GBC Cintra 2020 UV/Vis spectrophotometer. Photocatalytic stability was determined on the recollected suspension from the former experiment based on centrifugation, filtration and frying at 80 °C for 8 h. The radical-trapping experiments were performed by adding ammonium oxalate (AO), tert-butylalcohol (TBA), and benzoquinone (BQ) into the CV and RhB solutions before irradiation and evaluated under the same conditions.
Calculation details
The density of state (DOS) of compound 3 was calculated as represented due to the fully occupied 3d orbital of a Zn2+ ion by density functional theory (DFT) calculations based on the CASTEP code, which uses a plane-wave basis set for the valence electrons and norm-conserving pseudopotential for the core electrons.21 The number of plane waves included in the basis was determined by a cutoff energy of 320 eV, and the numerical integration of the Brillouin zone was performed using a 2 × 2 × 2 Monkhorst–Pack k-point. The other calculating parameters and convergence criteria were set by the default values of the CASTEP code, for example, an energy convergence tolerance of 1.0 × 10−5 eV.
Results and discussion
Synthetic aspects
The title compounds were solvothermally prepared from the TM2+ (TM = Co, Ni, Zn, Fe) salts, 2,2-bipy, MX (M = Cu, Ag, X = Br, I), PbX2, KX in HX and acetonitrile solutions under the same reaction conditions. In the reaction, the TM2+ ions were in situ coordinated by 2,2-bipy into saturated [TM(2,2-bipy)3]2+ cations, which has also been reported in many inorganic–organic hybrid materials.22 We also studied the effects of many reaction factors in the solvothermal process, such as reactant stoichiometry, solvent, pH value, reaction temperature and time. It is found that the dosage of KX played an important role in controlling the syntheses of hybrid materials, which maybe due to the fact that KX is not only used as the source of X−, but also effectively increases the solubility of MX and PbX2. A higher concentration of X− ions will lead to low-dimensional oligomers or chains, while the lower one results in high dimensional structures, such as 2D layers or 3D microporous frameworks. In the syntheses of title compounds, we controlled the ratio of MX:PbX2:KX to be about 1:2:4. Furthermore, the reaction temperature also greatly affects the crystalline products, and the title compounds could not be obtained when the temperature was higher than 160 °C, which maybe due to the low thermal stabilities of title compounds based on the following TGA analyses.
Crystal structures
All the title compounds 1–6 belong to the monoclinic system with the space group P21/c (no. 14) and contain the same 1D [MPb2X7]2− anion chains separated by [TM(2,2-bipy)3]2+ complex cations. Due to their isomorphic structures, compound 1 is taken as an example to depict their crystal structures. In the asymmetric unit of compound 1, one crystallographically independent Ni2+, one Ag+, two Pb2+, seven I− ions and three 2,2-bipy ligands are present. As shown in Fig. 1a, the Ag(1) atom is coordinated by four I atoms into a distorted tetrahedral AgI4 unit with Ag–I bands of 2.7366(7)–2.9867(9) Å and I–Ag–I angles of 94.17(2)–129.11(3) Å, which belong to the normal values. Two neighboring AgI4 units are condensed via edge-sharing to form a [Ag2I6] dimer with a Ag⋯Ag distance of 4.03 Å, which is evidently longer than the sum of the van der Waals radii of AgI (3.44 Å). A Pb(1) atom adopts an unusual “octahedral [PbI4]” with a cis divacant coordination sphere with Pb–I bond lengths of 2.9448(6)–3.4346(5) Å, which maybe generated by the involvement of the Ag–I bonding proved by other related studies. Moreover, the Pb(1) atom also feature two weak Pb(1)–I(7) secondary bonding interactions at slightly longer distances of 3.5068(6) and 3.6036(6) Å approximately opposite to the Pb(1)–I(1) and Pb(1)–I(4) bonds. So the coordination environment of Pb(1) can also be considered as a seriously distorted [PbI6] octahedral geometry. Similar to the Pb(1) atom, the Pb(2) atom is also surrounded by six iodine atoms in a distorted octahedral geometry with four normal Pb–I bond distances of 3.0611(6)–3.2879(5) Å and two longer Pb–I bond lengths of 3.6123(6)–3.6453(6) Å. Each of the two Pb(1)I6 and Pb(2)I6 octahedral units is successively interconnected via edge-sharing to form a [Pb4I14] ring. These [Pb4I14] tetramers are bridged by [Ag2I6] dimers via face-sharing to form a 1D [AgPb2I7]2− anionic chain along the b-axis (Fig. 1a). To date, only limited anionic heterometallic Ag–Pb iodides have been characterized, such as 1D-[Pb3Ag10I22]6−, [MPbI4]−, [M2Pb7I22]6− (M = Cu, Ag), [Ag2Pb2I9]3− chains and a 2D [Cu6Pb3I16]4− layer.18 Hence, the 1D [AgPb2I7]2− reported here represents a new 1D chain directed by TM complex cations. The neighboring 1D [AgPb2I7]2− chains feature a parallel stacking arrangement along the a- and c-axis, which are well-separated and bridged by [Ni(2,2-bipy)3]2+ complex cations via extensive C–H⋯I hydrogen bonds to form a 3D H-bonding network (Fig. 1b). In the compounds 4–6, the Cu–Br and Ag–Br bond distances fall in the range of 2.3383(16)–2.941(2) Å and 2.5841(9)–2.8861(10) Å, and Pb–Br bond lengths are 2.7277(8)–3.4923(8) Å, which are comparable with those reported in hybrid metal halides.23

Optical properties and thermal stabilities
The solid-state optical absorption reflection spectra of the compounds 1–6 were measured at room temperature. The optical band gaps (Eg) are obtained through the extrapolation of the linear portion of the absorption edges. As shown in Fig. 2, the optical band gaps of compounds 1, 2 and 6 are 1.92, 1.85 and 1.75 eV, which are in accordance with their dark red color. The band gaps of compounds 3, 4 and 5 are estimated to be 2.14, 2.07 and 2.18 eV, respectively, corresponding to the orange and pink color, which are slightly larger than those of iodides 1 and 2 mainly due to the lower band energy of 3d for a Br atom comparing with the 4d orbital of the I atom. Furthermore, the different electronic configurations of TMs lead to the evidently distinct band gaps for isostructural phases, which demonstrate the opportunity to tune the band gaps of hybrid materials by introducing different TM complexes as photosensitive dyes.

Obviously, all the title compounds have smaller band gaps and exhibit a red shift of the absorption edge compared with the primary metal halides, such as β-AgI (2.81 eV), CuBr (2.89 eV), AgBr (2.81 eV), PbI (2.3 eV) and PbBr (3.2 eV). The band gaps of the title compounds are also smaller than most of the 1D hybrid single metal halides, such as [Cu(2,2-bipy)3]Ag5I7 (2.80 eV), [Ni(2,2-bipy)(THF)2(H2O)2](Ag10I12)·32DMF (2.74 eV), [Mn(4,4-bipy)(DMF)3(H2O)]Ag5I7·4,4-bipy (3.12 eV), (H2pipe)Ag2I4 (3.74 eV), etc.24 The narrow band gaps of the title compounds are mainly driven by two possible reasons based upon our analyses. Firstly, the heterometals of Pb2+ and Ag+/Cu+ give more contribution to the top of the valence bands, pushes it up, and thus leads to the smaller band gaps. Secondly, the greater contribution to the bottom of the conduction bands and d–d transition of photosensitive TM complex cations also greatly reduces the band gaps of hybrid materials, which have been investigated and proved by molecular orbital calculations for some related studies.
The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) shows that the compounds 1–6 start to decompose at about 280 °C, 205 °C, 210 °C, 230 °C, 280 °C and 260 °C, respectively, and continuously lose weight, which may be due to the fact that the decomposition of complex organic cations simultaneously leads to the complete collapse and volatilization of the anionic networks (Fig. S1†). The low thermal stabilities of the hybrid materials are mainly due to the weak hydrogen bonds between the TM complex cations and anionic networks.
Photocatalytic properties
The photocatalytic activities of the obtained title phases were evaluated in terms of their photodegradation of organic pollutants such as CV, RhB and MO under visible light irradiation. Before the photocatalytic experiments, neither the photolysis experiment without a photocatalyst nor the catalytic experiment without light irradiation showed any observable decrease in CV, RhB and MO concentration with time. After the samples 1–5 were singly added to the solution of CV until absorption equilibrium between the photocatalyst and CV molecules, the mixture was exposed to visible light irradiation. Fig. 3 shows the plots of C/C0 of CV solutions versus irradiation time for compounds 1–5, where C and C0 represent the remnant and initial concentrations of organic dyes, respectively. Under the photodegradation action of samples 1–3, the degradation ratio of CV nearly reaches 98% exposed to the visible light irradiation for 60 min, which is also demonstrated by the change in the color of the solution (Fig. S2†). As for compound 4, the CV molecule hardly decomposed with a photodegradation of only about 30%. Surprisingly, the CV solution was rapidly photodegraded by sample 5 with degradation ratios of nearly 100% after 20 min resulting in complete decolorization (Fig. 3a). It should be noted that we also studied the photodegradation reactions of a saturated solution of samples 1–5 by filtering out the powder suspensions after the absorption balance between the organic pollutants and powder samples. Subsequently, the filtered solution was exposed to visible light irradiation, and results indicated that there is no obvious change in color and concentration of the organic pollutant solution based on the UV-vis absorption spectrum, which further proves that the saturated solution of samples feature slight photocatalytic activities (Fig. S3†). Hence, we can safely come to a conclusion that the photodegradation of organic pollutants mainly originate from the contribution of the powder sample in the former experiments.

At the same time, we studied the photodegradation properties of photocatalyst N-doped TiO2 for comparing under the completely same conditions, and the results show that more than 71% of CV is still present after irradiation for 60 min. Obviously, all the title compounds feature higher photodegradation activity than N-doped TiO2 for a CV pollutant under visible light irradiation except for sample 4. Furthermore, we continue to study the photodegradation behaviour of sample 5 for RhB and MO pollutants. The results show that RhB and MO also completely degraded within 30 min, which was faster than those of N-doped TiO2 under the same reaction conditions (Fig. S4†). Hence, sample 5 features the excellent visible light driven photocatalytic activities among the title compounds. It should be noted that sample 4 containing [Co(2,2-bipy)3]2+ features the worst photocatalytic activity, and a similar phenomenon is also found in other hybrid iodoargentates based on the same [Co(2,2-bipy)3]2+ cations.19 However, it is a pity that the detailed reason for such differences remains unclear at this stage.
To further accurately evaluate the photocatalytic activities of the samples 1–5 and N-doped TiO2, we studied the corresponding kinetic process based on ln(C0/C) = kt assuming that the photodegradation procedure belongs to the pseudo-first-order reaction, where k represents rate constants (Fig. 3b). For the CV photodegradation reaction, the calculated k values of compounds 1, 2, 3 and 5 are 0.046, 0.030, 0.035 and 0.131 min−1, respectively, which are evidently larger than that of P25 (0.016 min−1). The rate constant of compound 5 is found to be nearly 8 times larger than that of N-doped TiO2, respectively. As for RhB and MO solutions, the k value of compound 5 is nearly 14 and 12 times larger than that of N-doped TiO2, which shows the highest photocatalytic activity of 5 among these phases (Fig. 4). In addition, we know that, the visible light responding photocatalytic activities of the phase 5 are also greatly higher than those reported for hybrid binary iodoargentates, such as K[TM(bipy)3]Ag6I11, [(Me)2-bipy]2Ag7I11, [Mn(phen)3]2Ag11I15 and [Mn(phen)3]2Ag13I17, etc.13a,19b

In addition to the photocatalytic activity, the photochemical stability also plays an important role for their practical application, especially for those Ag-based photosensitive materials. Therefore, we investigated the repeated photocatalytic degradation of CV over sample 3 as an instance under the same conditions. It is found that sample 3 features a stable photocatalytic activity with no obvious decrease of the photodecomposition rate and efficiency under three repeated applications (Fig. 3c). For the photocatalytic degradation of RhB and MO pollutants, compound 5 also does not show any apparent decrease of the photocatalytic activity even after five successive operations (Fig. S5†). The final PXRD patterns of the photocatalysts after the photocatalytic reaction are almost identical to those of the as-prepared sample further confirming that there are no obvious changes in the crystal structures (Fig. S6†).
Possible photocatalytic mechanism
In order to gain insight into the photocatalytic reaction mechanism, we firstly conducted the radical-trapping experiments to check the active species in the degradation of organic dyes over samples 3 and 5 by using several scavengers, i.e., tert-butyl alcohol (TBA, an ˙OH radical scavenger), ammonium oxalate (AO, a hole scavenger) and benzoquinone (BQ, an ˙O2− radical scavenger). As shown in Fig. 3d, although the addition of TBA, AO and BQ partially inhibited the photocatalytic activities, most of the CV pollutants were photodegraded under visible light irradiation. For sample 5, the CV and RhB pollutants were also degraded under the radical-trapping action. The results show that the addition of TBA, AO and BQ has little effects on the photocatalytic activities of the title samples, which indicate that ˙OH, h+ and ˙O2− play a minimal role for the photodegradation of organic pollutants.
To further investigate the electron transfer mechanism, we calculate the electronic band structure of compound 3 based on the DFT method. Compared with the experimental band gap of 1.83 eV, the calculated indirect band gap of 1.60 eV is small. The discrepancy is due to the limitation of the DFT method that generally underestimates the band gap in semiconductors and insulators. As shown in Fig. 5, the valence bands (VB) just below the Fermi level of compound 3 (the top of the VB) arise mainly from the I-5p, Ag-4d and Pb-6s. The conduction bands (CB) just above the Fermi level (the bottom of CB) are mainly contributed by the C-2p and N-2p orbitals. Obviously, the hybridization between the I-5p, Ag-4d and Pb-6s would raise the energy position of the VB giving the smaller band gap. As for compounds 1, 2 and 4–6 based on Ni2+, Co2+ and Fe2+, the d–d transition within [TM(2,2-bipy)3]2+ ions also effectively decrease the band gap. Therefore, we believe that the optical absorptions at the low energy region can be mainly ascribed to the charge transitions from the 1D [AgPb2I7]2− chains to the [Zn(2,2-bipy)3]2+ complex chains in compound 3.

Based on these experimental and calculation results as well as the relative reports, the possible photocatalytic mechanism for charge transfer is proposed (Fig. 6). In the typical photocatalytic process, the absorbed photon of hybrid materials would be separated into photogenerated electrons and holes under visible light irradiation. The photogenerated holes on VBs directly oxide X− ions to X0, which oxidize organic dyes and become reduced to X− ions again. According to the band structure calculation, the photogenerated electrons are transferred from the VB (1D [MPb2X7]2− chains) to the CB ([TM(2,2-bipy)3]2+) complex cations, which are able to effectively trap the photoexcited electrons to inhibit the recombination of photoinduced electron–hole pairs and thus enhance their photocatalytic activities in the degradation of organic pollutants.

As far as we know, the primary silver and cuprous halides are seldom independently used as photocatalysts due to their instability under sunlight. As the stable visible light driven photocatalyst of the hybrid silver and cuprous lead(II) halides, some possible reasons are proposed upon our analyses. Firstly, the photogenerated electrons are transferred to the [TM(2,2-bipy)3]2+ cations rather than being transferred to the Cu+ or Ag+ ions of 1D anionic chains, which can effectively prevent the reduction of Cu+ and Ag+ ions and increase the photochemical stabilities. At the same time, the [TM(2,2-bipy)3]2+ complex based on conjugated organic ligands feature excellent electron absorption and transfer abilities, which is capable of promoting the separation of photogenerated electron and hole pairs. Secondly, the hybrid heterometallic lead halides feature more narrow band gaps and visible light absorption abilities than the primary binary metal halides due to the photosensitization of TM complex cationic dyes and great contribution of multiple metals for the valence bands. Hence, the introduction of heteroatoms and TM complex cations not only significantly regulate the banding characterization and crystal structures of binary lead halides, but also contribute to the electronic band structures and therefore lead to the stable visible light driven photodegradation activities of organic pollutants.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have synthesized a series of hybrid heterometallic silver and cuprous lead(II) halides with 1D [MPb2X7]2− anionic chains. The optical diffuse reflection spectra reveal that the introduction of d10 heteroatoms and photosensitive TM complex cationic dyes leads to the narrow band gaps of heterometallic lead(II) halides. The title compounds feature stable and efficient visible light driven photodegradation activities for organic pollutants, which are mainly influenced by their band gaps. The successful syntheses and visible light driven photocatalytic properties of the title compounds further illustrate the possibilities of constructing new hybrid metal halides and evident tunable abilities of band structures and physical properties by the introduction of heteroatoms and TM metal complex cationic dyes. Further studies on the structural regulation and structure–photocatalytic property relationships are in progress in our group.
