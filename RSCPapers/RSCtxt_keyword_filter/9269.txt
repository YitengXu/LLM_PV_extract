A, 2013, 1, 13679-13686Influence of cyclic versus acyclic oxygen-containing electron donor ancillary ligands on the photocurrent, photovoltage and photostability for high efficiency dye-sensitized solar cells†Ahmed El-Shafei*a, Maqbool Hussaina, Ashraful Islamb and Liyuan HanbaPolymer and Color Chemistry Program, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC 27695, USA. E-mail: Ahmed_EL-Shafei@ncsu.edubPhotovoltaic Materials Unit, National Institute for Materials Science, 1-2-1 Sengen, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-0047, JapanReceived 16th July 2013, Accepted 2nd September 2013First published on 2nd September 2013AbstractThree novel heteroleptic amphiphilic polypyridyl Ru-complexes, MH01, MH03, and MH05, with oxygen-containing-electron-donor stilbazole-based ancillary ligands were synthesized to study the influence of the cyclic-electron-donor (MH01), the presence of the cyclic electron donor coupled to acyclic electron-donor auxochromes (MH03) ortho to the CHCH bridge of stilbazole, and the presence of only acyclic electron-donor methoxy group (MH05) on molar extinction coefficient, light harvesting efficiency (LHE), ground and excited state oxidation potentials, and photovoltaic performance for DSSCs. Although MH05 has three electron donor methoxy groups, it achieved the lowest molar extinction coefficient of 18250 M−1 cm−1 and exhibited the lowest photocurrent. The highest photocurrent density (JSC) was observed for the longest interatomic distance between the CHCH bridge of the stilbazole moiety and cyclic-electron-donor auxochromes (MH01). It was also shown that while incorporation of acyclic electron-donor auxochromes ortho to the CHCH bridge (MH03) has little effect on the ground and excited state oxidation potentials, λmax of the low energy MLCT, and molar absorptivity, the lowest photovoltage and %η were observed. When compared under the same experimental device conditions using 0.3 M tert-butylpyridine (TBP), only MH01-TBA achieved 18% more in JSC and 8.6% greater in η than the benchmark dye N719. To probe the interrelationship among the cyclic-vs.-acyclic oxygen-containing electron donors of the ancillary ligands, photocurrent and photovoltage of these dyes, the equilibrium molecular geometries of the ancillary ligands were calculated using DFT. The HOMO distribution on cyclic-vs.-acyclic electron donors and the position of OMe in the ancillary ligands rationalized the fundamental science behind the photovoltaic performance and photostability of these dyes.IntroductionDye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on polypyridyl Ru(II) complexes have attracted strong attention from the academia and industry due to their unique photophysical and energy transfer properties including their broad spectral response, attractive excited state properties, multiple stable oxidation states1–18 and high efficiency electron injection.19,20 Although N719 is the most common dye for DSSCs, owing to its hydrophilic nature, the long-term device stability is not satisfactory.21,22 In this respect, efforts toward improving the long-term device stability had led to the development of an amphiphilic sensitizer Z-907. However, the molar extinction coefficient of Z-907 was lower than that of N719,23 owing to the presence of a long alkyl chain and the absence of strong electron donor auxochromes. To improve the molar extinction coefficient while maintaining the amphiphilic properties, another generation of sensitizers was developed containing electron donor auxochrome coded Z-910,24K-19,25 and K73.26 The molecular structures of Z-907, Z-910, K19, and K73 (Fig. 1) are based on extending the π-conjugation of bipyridyl to produce red shift in the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) absorption peaks and incorporating electron-donor auxochromes (alkoxy groups) to enhance the molar extinction coefficient. Fig. 1  Molecular structures of Z-907, Z-910, K19, and K73. However, no work was reported in the literature that addresses the interrelationship between the location and form of electron donors, cyclic-vs.-acyclic, of oxygen-containing electron-donor ancillary ligands, and the photocurrent and photovoltage of polypyridyl Ru(II) complexes for DSSCs.Here, we report a series of novel polypyridyl Ru(II) complexes (MH01, MH03, and MH05) that rationalize the fundamental science of the structure–performance relationship for DSSCs.Fig. 2 shows the molecular structures of MH01-TBA, MH01, MH03 and MH05. MH01-TBA was synthesized by reacting MH01 with tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBA). Fig. 2  Molecular structures of dyes N719, MH01-TBA, MH01, MH03 and MH05. Results and discussionProposed reaction mechanismFig. 3 shows the proposed reaction pathway for the condensation of aromatic aldehydes and 2,2′-dimethylbipyridyl in the presence of trimethylsilylchloride (SiMe3–Cl) to produce the target stilbazoles. The synthesis was carried out at 100 °C in a pressure tube. The bipyridyl methyl groups are activated by formation of an N–SiMe3 moiety (cf. 1 → 2). A second equivalent of SiMe3–Cl facilitates the reaction with the aldehydes (2 → 3) which is followed by the elimination of trimethylsilanol (3 → 4) and removal of the –SMe3 group (cf. 4 → AL01, AL03, AL05), giving the stilbazole group. Fig. 3  Proposed reaction pathway for the synthesis of bistilbazole ancillary ligands (AL01, AL03, AL-05) of M01, MH03 and MH05. UV-Visible absorptionFig. 4 shows a comparison between the absorption and emission spectra of N719versusMH01–05, measured in DMF (2 × 10−5 mol). The spectrophotometric properties are summarized in Table 1. MH01, MH03 and MH05 showed intense and broad bands at 367 nm (47250 M−1 cm−1), 404 nm (41250 M−1 cm−1) and 358 nm (66800 M−1 cm−1) and broad metal-to-ligand-charge-transfer (MLCT) peaks at 545 nm (21500 M−1 cm−1), 544 nm (21350 M−1 cm−1), and 542 nm (31400 M−1 cm−1), respectively, which are bathochromically shifted by 12–15 nm compared to that of N719. From the data presented in Table 1, it is evident that the lower energy MLCT peaks of these new dyes exhibited higher molar extinction coefficient and are more bathochromically shifted than that of N719. However, MH05 exhibited the lowest molar extinction coefficient among the new dyes. The enhanced bathochromic shift of the low energy MLCT of MH01, MH03 and MH05 rendered these sensitizers better light harvesting dyes for DSSCs in the NIR region. Additionally, owing to the cyclic nature of the electron donor moiety of the ancillary ligand of MH01, it showed the highest emission intensity compared to MH03 (steric effect of OMe) and MH05 (acyclic), which confirms that the concentration of the singlet excited state species of MH01 is the highest, and therefore it is likely to exhibit the highest short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC), which was confirmed from the JSC measurements.

The measured photoemission yield spectra on TiO2 are shown in the ESI.† The experimental ionization potential values for MH01, MH03, MH05 and N719 were −5.53, −5.50, 5.52, and 5.76 eV, respectively. These results confirmed that the energy difference between the Ru3+/2+ potential (IP) of these dyes and the I3−/I− redox couple (−5.20 eV)27 is large enough for efficient regeneration of the dye through reaction with iodide. Table 2 summarizes the experimental and calculated E0–0, the ground and excited state oxidation potentials of the aforementioned dyes. The excited state oxidation potential E* (Ru3+/*) values were estimated using eqn (1), where E (Ru3+/2+) is the oxidation potential of the ground state and E0–0 is the energy difference between the lowest excited singlet and ground states. The resulting E* (Ru3+/*) values are shown in Table 2. The experimental excited-state oxidation potential E* (Ru3+/*) values of dyes MH01, MH03 and MH05 were −3.61, −3.62 and −3.63 eV, respectively, which lay above the conduction band edge of nanocrystalline TiO2 (−4.2 eV).28 Hence, efficient excited-state electron injection from the excited state into the conduction band edge of TiO2 is thermodynamically favorable. E* (Ru3+/*) = E (Ru3+/2+) − E0–0(1)

Table 2 shows the calculated Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO), the excited state oxidation potential (Ru3+/*), and the lowest singlet–singlet electronic transitions (E0–0) for MH01, MH03 and MH05 compared to N719, which were in excellent agreement with the experimental results.The MO calculation analyses of MH01, MH03 and MH05 showed that the HOMO is delocalized not only on Ru and NCS but also on the ancillary ligands carrying meta–para-cyclic auxochromes (MH01 and MH03). However, in the case of MH05 (acyclic), the HOMO distribution on the electron ancillary ligands was negligible. This elucidated that the presence of meta–para-cyclic electron donor auxochromes linked to bipyridyl through the CHCH spacer forms a stilbazole linkage with an enhanced electron rich regime on the ancillary ligand, which contributed significantly to the ligand-to-ligand charge transfer (LLCT) and enhanced the MLCT as well. This is likely due to stronger p-orbital overlap between the electron donor oxygen in the cyclic form and aromatic stilbazole because the lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen atom are in better alignment with the p-orbitals of the aromatic system. In the case of MH05, it is clear from the DFT calculation that the distribution of the HOMO on the ancillary ligand is negligible, which suggests that the charge transfer from the ancillary ligand to the LUMO is not strong. In the case of MH03, the HOMO distribution on the ancillary ligand is strong due to the presence of OMe at the ortho position. However, in order for a strong electronic overlap between the electron donor synthon, the CHCH bridge and the stilbazole moiety to take place, a free rotation of the electron donors around the CHCH bridge is required. It is likely that the presence of OMe ortho to the CHCH bridging group precludes free rotation of the electron donor and locks the conformation, which would prevent the electronic overlap of similar HOMO lobes and that would weaken the electronic overlap with the stilbazole moiety. As shown in Fig. 5, the HOMO lobes on the electron moiety and the CHCH bridging group are opposite to each other (red-green not red-red) and a free rotation is required for a strong electronic overlap between similar HOMO lobes. The calculated LUMOs of MH01, MH03 and MH05 were delocalized on the acceptor bipyridyl ligand and extended to the carboxylic group (Fig. 5). Fig. 5  Calculated HOMO (left) and LUMO (right) isosurfaces (isodensity of 0.02) of MH01, MH03 and MH05. ATR-FTIR spectral dataATR-FIR spectra of MH01, MH03 and MH05 exhibited strong and intense absorption peaks at 2102–2104 cm−1, corresponding to the isothiocyanate (N-bonded isomer) group. The spectra also showed a strong absorption peak at 1720 cm−1 corresponding to the carbonyl of COOH in MH01, MH03 and MH05 and broad peaks at 3437 cm−1, corresponding to the OH of COOH.Photovoltaic propertiesThe photovoltaic performance of dyes MH01, MH03 and MH05 on the nanocrystalline TiO2 electrode was studied under standard AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2) using an electrolyte with a composition of 0.6 M dimethylpropyl-imidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI and 0.3–0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile. Fig. 6 shows the incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra for the cells fabricated with dyes MH01-TBA, MH01, MH03 and MH05 and N719, where the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) values are plotted as a function of wavelength. Dye MH01-TBA demonstrated the most efficient sensitization of nanocrystalline TiO2 over the whole visible range extending into the near IR region (ca. 860 nm) with a quantum efficiency of about 90% in the plateau region. Fig. 6  Photocurrent action spectra (IPCE) obtained with dyes MH01-TBA, MH03, MH01-05 and N719 anchored on a nanocrystalline TiO2 film. The short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factors (FF) and overall cell efficiencies (η) for each dye-TiO2 electrode are summarized in Table 3. The photovoltaic performance parameters of MH01-TBA, MH01, MH03 and MH05, and N719-sensitized cells were studied using an electrolyte containing 0.3TBP. N719 and MH01-TBA were also studied using 0.5TBP concentration. Under the same experimental device conditions, MH01-TBA showed higher photocurrent and greater total conversion efficiency than N719, and this improvement was attributed to the superior light harvesting efficiency (LHE) of MH01-TBA in the high and low energy photon regions compared to N719. The short-circuit photocurrent of N719 decreased as the TBP concentrations increased due to the upward shift in the conduction band and the decrease in the negative free energy.30 On the other hand, the open-circuit voltage increased significantly and the fill factor increased slightly as the TBP concentration increased. It is likely that TBP was adsorbed on the bare TiO2 surface and formed a thick layer that suppressed the recombination between the injected electron and I3− ions. Using 0.5TBP in the case of MH01, the JSC decreased as expected but the increase in the VOC was an infinitesimal.

As shown in Table 3, under the same experimental device conditions with the electrolyte containing 0.3 M TBP under standard AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2), the solar cell sensitized with MH01-TBA showed the best performance in terms of a short-circuit photocurrent density of 20.09 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage of 0.688 V, and a fill factor of 0.702, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 9.91% compared to 9.12% of N719. Hence, this class of electron donor cyclic auxochrome is considered as an attractive class of sensitizers for high efficiency DSSCs. Furthermore, through molecular modeling and tuning LHE and electron injection, more efficient sensitizers can be developed.

CEM and IMVS characterizationTo further understand the molecular structure dependent VOC for N719, MH01, MH01-TBA, MH03 and MH05, we first measured the relative conduction band position of TiO2 by means of a charge extraction method. Fig. 8 shows VOC as a function of electron density for all dyes. A linear increase in VOC as a function of electron density was observed for all DSSCs. Notably, the plots for all dyes overlapped with each other, indicating that all of the dyes have almost the same effect on the conduction band of TiO2 regardless of the substituents on the bpy. Therefore, the molecular structure dependent VOC for all DSSCs should be attributed to the extent of charge recombination that is related to the electron lifetime (τ) in TiO2. Intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy was used to measure τ, and Fig. 9 shows the relationship between τ and electron density for all DSSCs. At a certain electron density, τ follows the following order: N719 > MH01-TBA > MH01 > MH05 > MH03. MH01-TBA exhibited a much longer τ than MH03 and MH05 at the same electron density, implying that the recombination between electrons on the TiO2 surface and I3− ions in the electrolyte was considerably suppressed by the presence of TBA. Moreover, the effect of cyclic-vs.-acyclic electron donors and the steric effect of OMe on the ancillary ligands played an important role in controlling the charge life time in TiO2 as the life time decreased from MH01 to MH03 to MH05. It is becoming clear that the cyclic electron donor of the ancillary ligands produces better LLCT, MLCT, greater emission intensity, and longer charge life time in TiO2, which can be attributed to the electronic effect and the orientation of anchored dye on TiO2. It is likely that the cyclic electron donor of MH01 allows for better geometry orientation and a more compact layer of the anchored dye on the TiO2 film to take place, which increases the charge life time and suppresses the back electron transfer from TiO2 to I3− in the electrolytes. This hypothesis is supported by the JSC measurements presented in Fig. 6, where MH01 showed the highest JSC.

Fig. 9  Electron lifetime (τ) as a function of VOC for DSSCs sensitized with N719, MH01, MH01-TBA, MH03 and MH05. Electron lifetime was measured by means of intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy. EIS characterizationElectrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed to study electron lifetimes and photoinduced electron injection properties under open circuit and illuminated conditions. Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 show the EIS Nyquist and Bode plots, respectively, for the DSSCs based on N719, MH01-TBA, MH01, MH03 and MH05 dyes. As shown in Fig. 10, the Nyquist plots exhibited the radius of the second semicircle, indicating that the electron recombination resistance increased in the order of N719 > MH01-TBA > MH01 > MH05 > MH03. Fig. 10  EIS Nyquist plots for DSSCs sensitized with N719, MH01, MH01-TBA, MH03 and MH05.  Fig. 11  EIS Bode plots for DSSCs sensitized with N719, MH01, MH01-TBA, MH03 and MH05. In the Bode phase plot (as shown in Fig. 11), the middle frequency peak in the 1–100 Hz range is indicative of the electron recombination between the electrolyte and TiO2. The middle-frequency peaks of the DSSCs based on N719 and MH01-TBA shift to lower frequency relative to those of MH03 and MH05, indicating a shorter recombination lifetime for the latter case. This trend is in accordance with the τ vs. VOC results, which is in agreement with the fact that MH01-TBA exhibited higher VOC values (0.688 V) than MH03 (0.520 V) or MH05 (0.668 V).Long-term stability measurements of dyes and devicesStability is a key factor for evaluating the practical applications of DSSCs. Each component as well as a sealing technique of a device can impact its stability to different extents during long-term applications under severe environment. In DSSCs, the dye should be stable enough under light irradiation as a precondition for a long-term stable device. Katoh and coworkers have developed a simple and efficient method to evaluate the stability of sensitizer dyes in a short period of time.31 Since the most unstable state of the sensitizer is in its regeneration process, the corresponding sensitizers must remain stable in the cationic state for at least 10 s to be capable of realizing a 10-year operation cycle. To shorten the experimental period, we can accelerate the dye aging process under light irradiation on the dye-loaded TiO2 electrode. Without the electrolyte, dye regeneration could occur only by receiving injected electrons from TiO2, which takes 104–103 times longer than that in a complete solar cell device. After 45 min of light irradiation on sensitized TiO2 electrodes fabricated from MH01 and MH03, the absorbance of MH01 remained almost the same while that of MH03 decreased to some extent (Fig. 12a and b). Meanwhile, the color purple of the MH01 loaded TiO2 film did not change throughout the whole experiment while the MH03 based film faded quickly from purple to light red. Such a difference in response to light irradiation between MH01 and MH03 reveals that the photo-stability of the former is significantly higher, confirming the detrimental effect of the OMe group ortho to the CHCH bridge in MH03. It is likely that the presence of the OMe group at the ortho position with respect to the CHCH bridging group increases the electron density on the bridge, which increases its susceptibility to free radical attack, photo-oxidation, and photodegradation. For further evaluation of long-term stability of MH01-based DSSCs, a less volatile electrolyte (containing 0.6 M 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.15 M iodine, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate and 0.5 M NMBI in 3-methoxypropionitrile) was employed. Hence the photovoltaic performance of the device in this experiment is a little lower than the above-mentioned volatile electrolyte device. Fig. 13 shows the variations of photovoltaic parameters during a long-term accelerated aging on MH01 based solar cells. Values for VOC, JSC, FF, and η were recorded over a period of 1000 h. After continuously soaking in full sunlight at 60 °C, the overall efficiency of the MH01-based DSSC maintained 95% of the initial value. This demonstrates that the amount of dye on the TiO2 surface remained intact after long time light soaking confirming it superior photostability. These results suggest that MH01 holds great potential for the practical applications of DSSCs.

Fig. 13  Evolutions of photovoltaic performance parameters for MH01-based DSSCs under one sun soaking at 60 °C over a period of 1000 h. The TiO2 film thickness was 15 μm, and the cell was illuminated at room temperature through the conducting glass from the anode side with a solar simulator (WXS-155S-10) under AM 1.5 illumination (light intensity: 100 mW cm−2). ConclusionsCompared to N719 under the same experimental device conditions, it was demonstrated that the novel Ru(II) based complex MH01-TBA achieved 34% more in molar absorptivity, 18% more in photocurrent, and 8.6% more in total solar-to-electric conversion efficiency. The superior performance of MH01-TBA was attributed to the presence of cyclic oxygen containing ancillary antenna, which enhanced the LHE and the photocurrent of MH01. It was shown that the form of electron donors, cyclic versus acyclic, and the presence of OMe at the ortho position with respect to the bridge of stilbazole plays a key role in the molar extinction coefficient, life time of electrons in TiO2, photocurrent density (JSC), photostability and total solar-to-electric conversion efficiency. MH01, which contains meta–para-cyclic electron donors, exhibited the highest molar extinction coefficient, longest electron life time in TiO2, highest photocurrent and total conversion efficiency. It is likely that the conjugation between the lone pairs of electrons of the p-orbital of the two oxygen atoms in the cyclic ancillary ligands of MH01 forms stronger overlap and conjugation with the p-orbital of the aromatic stilbazole system than the acyclic form (MH05), which translated into enhanced light harvesting in MH01. Owing to the presence of OMe at the ortho position in MH03, it exhibited the shortest life time in TiO2 nanoparticles, lowest photostability and lowest solar-to-electron conversion efficiency. Although MH05 possesses three freely rotating OMe (acyclic), its %η was lower than that of MH01, which possesses two electron donors in the cyclic form. This is expected because electron donor substituents at the meta position are weaker electron donors compared to electron donors at the ortho and/or para positions. Hence, it can be concluded that the cyclic electron donor of the ancillary ligands produces better LLCT, MLCT, greater emission intensity, and longer charge life time in TiO2, which can be attributed to the electronic effect and favorable orientation of the anchored dye on the TiO2 film. It is likely that the cyclic electron donor of MH01 allows better geometry orientation of the dye on the TiO2 film forming a compact layer of the dye, which increases charge life time and suppresses charge recombinations. Owing to the high efficiency and superior long term stability of MH01 over 1000 h at 60 °C, as it retained 95% of its original photovoltaic performance, there is great potential for its use in the practical applications of DSSCs. These new findings confirm that the location and form of electron donors whether cyclic-or-acyclic have a significant impact on the photovoltaic performance of dyes for DSSCs.AcknowledgementsThe authors are grateful to Prof. H.
