    , Accepted 17th March 2014First published on 17th March 2014AbstractIndene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA) is used as an electron-cascade acceptor material in poly{4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-4,6-diyl} (PTB7):[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric-acid-methyl-ester (PC71BM) blend to fabricate ternary blend polymer solar cells (PSCs). Due to higher lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of ICBA relative to PC71BM, the open circuit voltage (VOC) increases with the addition of ICBA. ICBA plays a bridging role between PTB7 and PC71BM, thus providing more routes for charge transfer at the donor/acceptor (D/A) interface. When the ICBA content is much smaller than the PC71BM content, the morphology of the ternary blend active layer is similar to that of the PTB7:PC71BM blend, which guarantees suitable phase separation and efficient charge transport. Ternary blend devices with 15% ICBA content exhibit an average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.13%, higher than that (7.23%) of the PTB7:PC71BM binary blend. Without any further device work (such as interlayer, invert structure and tandem cells), the ternary blend PSCs exhibit PCEs as high as 8.24%, which is the highest reported for ternary blend PSCs and ICBA-related PSCs.

Broader context
Recently, indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA) was developed as a new fullerene acceptor, and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):ICBA based polymer solar cells (PSCs) exceeded 7%, which was much higher than that of the P3HT:PCBM counterpart. Unfortunately, PSCs based on low-bandgap polymer donors and ICBA acceptors yielded lower PCEs (2–4%) relative to their low-bandgap polymer:PCBM counterparts. In this work, we used ICBA as an electron-cascade acceptor material in PSCs based on the low-bandgap polymer PTB7:PC71BM blend. Due to higher LUMO energy levels of ICBA relative to PC71BM, the VOC increases with the addition of ICBA. ICBA can play a bridging role between PTB7 and PC71BM, thus providing efficient charge transfer at the D/A interface. Meanwhile, when the ICBA content is much smaller than the PC71BM content, the morphology of the ternary blend active layer is similar to that of PTB7:PC71BM, which guarantees suitable phase separation and efficient charge transport. Ternary blend devices with 15% ICBA content exhibit an average PCE of 8.13%, higher than that (7.23%) of the PTB7:PC71BM binary blend. Without any further device work (such as interlayer, invert structure and tandem cells), the ternary blend PSCs exhibit PCEs as high as 8.24%, which is the best reported for ternary blend PSCs and ICBA-related PSCs.

1. Introduction
Due to environmental pollution and traditional energy depletion, solar cells have attracted considerable attention. Especially, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been the focus of research in the past decade due to some advantages, such as simple preparation under ambient temperature and pressure conditions, light weight, low cost and flexibility.1–9 Nowadays, BHJ PSCs have shown power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 9% for single junction cells10–12 and 10% for tandem cells.13,14
BHJ PSCs consist of a blend layer of conjugated polymer donors and acceptors sandwiched between a transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) positive electrode and a low work function metal negative electrode.15 Ideal polymer donor materials should have a broad and strong absorption band in visible and near infrared regions to match the solar spectrum and high hole mobility to transport charges efficiently. Low-bandgap polymer donors with broad absorption and high hole mobility were developed to meet the requirements for ideal donor materials. Considerable efforts have been made towards the synthesis of low-bandgap polymer donors and PSC device optimization. To date, the PCEs of numerous low-bandgap polymer donor based PSCs exceed 8%.10–14,16–43
Ideal acceptor materials should have higher lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels to obtain higher open circuit voltage (VOC), high electron mobility and strong electron affinity to accept electrons. Recently, we developed indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA) as a new fullerene acceptor.15,44–47 The fullerene core has high electron mobility and strong electron affinity, while indene substitution upshifts the LUMO energy level to −3.74 eV.44 After optimization of morphology and device structure, the PCEs of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):ICBA based PSCs exceeded 7%.48–51 The best PCE for the P3HT:ICBA system was 7.5%,48 which was much higher than that of the P3HT:[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric-acid-methyl-ester (PCBM) counterpart.52
Unfortunately, PSCs based on low-bandgap polymer donors and ICBA acceptors yielded lower PCEs relative to their low-bandgap polymer:PCBM counterparts. McGehee and co-workers reported the PCE of 2.7% for PBDTTPD:ICBA, which was several times lower than that of its PBDTTPD:PCBM counterpart.53 The PCE of SiPCPDTBT:ICBA based PSCs was half of that of SiPCPDTBT:PCBM.54 PSCs based on PBDTTPD:ICBA and PBDTTT-C:ICBA exhibited PCEs of 2.20% and 3.92%, respectively, which were much lower than those of PCBM based PSCs (5.39% for PBDTTPD and 5.87% for PBDTTT-C).55
There are two main restrictions to obtain high efficiency of low-bandgap polymer:ICBA based PSCs: one is a loss in charge generation efficiency, which reduces the short circuit current density (JSC), the other is reduced charge carrier collection efficiency, which decreases the JSC and fill factor (FF).54 Charge generation is significantly influenced by the free energy driving force at the donor/acceptor (D/A) interface,56 the driving force for charge transfer in low-bandgap polymer:ICBA blends was generally less than 0.1 eV, which cannot guarantee efficient charge generation.55,57,58 Charge carrier collection is related to the morphology near the D/A interface59 and phase separation in blend.60 However, fine intermixing of low-bandgap polymer:ICBA blends disrupts molecular ordering, simultaneously blocking charge transport passways especially for electrons,54,60,61 which reduces the charge carrier collection efficiency.54,60,62–64
Recently, ternary blend PSCs have attracted considerable attention.61,65–75 For example, Thompson and co-workers reported ternary blend PSCs of P3HT:ICBA:PCBM.69,70 Introduction of ICBA into P3HT:PCBM led to improved VOC but decreased JSC. Brabec and coworkers fabricated ternary blend PSCs of P3HT:Si-PCPDTBT:ICBA, which consisted of two donors and one acceptor (ICBA).65
In this work, we used ICBA as an electron-cascade acceptor material in poly{4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl] thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-4,6-diyl} (PTB7):[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric-acid-methyl-ester (PC71BM) PSCs. Due to higher LUMO energy levels of ICBA relative to PC71BM, the VOC increases with the addition of ICBA. ICBA can play a bridging role61,76 between PTB7 and PC71BM, thus providing efficient charge transfer at the D/A interface.61,76 Meanwhile, when the ICBA content is much smaller than the PC71BM content, the morphology of the ternary blend active layer is similar to that of PTB7:PC71BM, which guarantees suitable phase separation and efficient charge transport. Ternary blend devices with 15% ICBA content exhibited an average PCE of 8.13%, higher than that (7.23%) of the PTB7:PC71BM binary blend. Without any further device work (such as interlayer, invert structure and tandem cells), the ternary blend PSCs exhibited PCEs as high as 8.24%, which is higher than the best PCE (7.02%) reported for ternary blend PSCs72 and the best PCE (7.5%) reported for ICBA-related PSCs.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Photovoltaic properties
PSCs with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:ICBA:PC71BM/Ca/Al were fabricated. The weight ratio of PTB7:fullerene acceptors was 1:1.5. The weight content of ICBA in fullerene acceptors changed from 0% to 100%. Fig. 1 shows the J–V and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of PTB7:ICBA:PC71BM devices with 0%, 15% and 30% of ICBA content under AM 1.5G illumination at an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Fig. 2 shows the average VOC, JSC, FF and PCE with different ICBA contents with error bars. Table 1 shows the average and best device characteristics at different ICBA contents. The average values of JSC, VOC, FF and PCE were calculated from 25 repetitive devices. We optimized the thickness of ternary active layers and found that 105–110 nm was the best thickness for all ternary devices. The thickness of all active layers is 105–110 nm. The ICBA content strongly affects the VOC, JSC, FF and PCE. The VOC increases with increasing ICBA content. The FF is slightly sensitive to the ICBA content when the ICBA content is less than 15%, and decreases significantly by further increasing the ICBA content from 15% to 100%. The JSC and PCE increase first and then decrease with increasing ICBA content. Compared with the binary blend of PTB7:PC71BM, the devices with 15% ICBA content exhibited enhanced performance: the average VOC increased from 0.701 to 0.720 V, the average JSC increased from 14.99 to 16.32 mA cm−2, the average FF slightly increased from 68.8% to 69.2%, and the average PCE increased from 7.23% to 8.13%. This ternary blend PSCs exhibited the best PCE as high as 8.24%, which is the highest reported for ternary blend PSCs and ICBA-related PSCs.

As shown in Fig. 1b, the trend of EQE is similar to that of JSC. The EQE is obviously enhanced when the weight ratio of ICBA in fullerene is 15%. However, this enhancement in spectral sensitivity is not due to absorption enhancement since ICBA addition did not cause any obvious change in absorption of the blend film. To evaluate the accuracy of the photovoltaic results, we calculated the JSC value from integration of the EQE spectra with the AM 1.5G reference spectrum. The calculated JSC value is similar to that obtained from J–V measurement (the average error is 2.8%, Table 1).
2.2. Effects of electron-cascade acceptor materials

Fig. 3 displays the energy levels of the materials (PTB7, ICBA and PC71BM) used in the ternary blend active layer, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and LUMO energy levels of ICBA and PC71BM were taken from the results we have measured before.44,46 The HOMO and LUMO of PTB7 were estimated from cyclic voltammetry (CV) under similar measurement conditions and similar calculation methods to those of ICBA and PC71BM.
 Fig. 3  Energy levels of PTB7, ICBA and PC71BM. 
The LUMO (HOMO) energy levels of PTB7, ICBA and PC71BM are −3.49 eV (−5.31 eV), −3.74 eV (−5.80 eV) and −3.91 eV (−5.87 eV), respectively. Both ICBA and PC71BM carry some of the electrons to the cathode. Due to higher LUMO energy levels of ICBA relative to PC71BM, the VOC increases with increasing weight ratio of ICBA in fullerene. This trend in VOC was also observed for other ternary blend PSCs in the literature.61,69,71,75 The cascade like energy levels of ternary blend PSCs can facilitate charge transfer at the D/A interface owing to the bridging effect.61,76 There are three routes for charge transfer (PTB7-ICBA, ICBA-PC71BM and PTB7-PC71BM) in ternary PSCs, more than that (one route) in the binary PTB7:PC71BM counterpart. Meanwhile, PC71BM can provide a driving force to transfer the electrons on the LUMO of ICBA to a lower energy orbital (the LUMO of PC71BM), which can facilitate charge transfer from PTB7 to ICBA. ICBA plays a role as an electron-cascade material in the ternary blend PSCs which can enhance the VOC and JSC.
2.3. Film morphologies

Fig. 4 shows the atomic force microscopy (AFM) height images and phase images of PTB7:ICBA:PC71BM blend films with different weight ratios of ICBA in fullerene. The films of binary blend (Fig. 4a) and 15% ICBA ternary blend (Fig. 4c) exhibit a typical cluster structure with many aggregated domains and a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.53 and 1.48 nm, respectively. The film becomes smoother and the RMS roughness significantly decreases from 1.48 to 0.339 nm when the ICBA weight content increases from 15% to 30% (Fig. 4e). For phase images, the phase separation sizes of the binary blend film (Fig. 4b) and 15% ICBA ternary blend film (Fig. 4d) are much larger than that of the 30% ICBA ternary blend film (Fig. 4f). The smaller scale phase separation in the 30% ICBA ternary blend is not favorable for efficient charge transport, leading to lower JSC, FF, EQE and PCE compared with binary blend and 15% ICBA ternary blend. The morphology of the PTB7:ICBA:PC71BM ternary blend is similar to that of the PTB7:PC71BM binary blend when the weight ratio of ICBA in fullerene is below 15%.

2.4. Charge carrier mobilities
The hole mobility and electron mobility of PTB7:ICBA:PC71BM blend films with different weight ratios of ICBA in fullerene were measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. 5 and Table 2).77 Hole-only and electron-only diodes were fabricated using the architectures: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:ICBA:PC71BM/Au for holes and Al/PTB7:ICBA:PC71BM/Al for electrons. The hole mobility and electron mobility were calculated from equations reported in the literature.68 The hole mobility and electron mobility of the binary blend and 15% ICBA ternary blend are similar (5.09 × 10−3vs. 5.11 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for hole; 1.59 × 10−4vs. 1.47 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for electron). The devices of the 30% ICBA ternary blend exhibit lower hole mobility (3.89 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) and lower electron mobility (7.66 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) compared with the binary blend devices. The lower mobilities of the devices based on the 30% ICBA ternary blend are due to uniform intermixing of polymer and fullerene (Fig. 4f), which is not favorable for charge transport. When the ICBA content was below 15%, the morphology of the ternary blend active layer was similar to that of PTB7:PC71BM, which guaranteed suitable phase separation and efficient charge transport passways.

3. Conclusion
We used ICBA as an electron-cascade acceptor material in PTB7:PC71BM blends to fabricate ternary blend PSCs. Due to higher LUMO energy levels of ICBA relative to PC71BM, the VOC increases with the addition of ICBA. ICBA plays a bridging role between PTB7 and PC71BM, thus providing more routes for charge transfer at the D/A interface. Meanwhile, when the ICBA content was much lower than PC71BM content (e.g. 15% in fullerene), the morphology of the ternary blend active layer was similar to that of PTB7:PC71BM, which guaranteed suitable phase separation and efficient charge transport. Compared with the binary blend of PTB7:PC71BM, the ternary blend devices with 15% ICBA content exhibited enhanced VOC, JSC, FF and PCE. Without any further device work (such as interlayer, invert structure and tandem cells), the ternary blend PSCs exhibited PCEs as high as 8.24%, which is the highest reported for ternary blend PSCs and ICBA-related PSCs. Our results demonstrate that the use of ICBA as an electron-cascade acceptor material in the binary blend is a promising way towards high-performance polymer solar cells based on low-bandgap polymer donors and fullerene acceptors.
4. Experimental section
Bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells were fabricated with the structure: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:ICBA:PC71BM/Ca/Al. PTB7 was purchased from One Material Inc, PC71BM (purity >99.0%) was purchased from American Dye Inc, and ICBA was synthesized according to our previously reported procedure.44 The patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass (sheet resistance = 15 Ω □−1) was pre-cleaned in an ultrasonic bath of acetone and isopropanol, and treated in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber (Jelight Company, USA) for 20 min. A thin layer (35 nm) of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Baytron PVP AI 4083, Germany) was spin-coated onto the ITO glass and baked at 150 °C for 20 min. A blend of PTB7:ICBA:PC71BM in dichlorobenzene (DCB) solvent (10 mg ml−1 for PTB7, 15 mg ml−1 for fullerene) with solvent additives (3% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO)) was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer to form a photosensitive layer. A calcium (ca. 20 nm) and aluminium layer (ca. 100 nm) was then evaporated onto the surface of the photosensitive layer under vacuum (ca. 10−5 Pa) to form the negative electrode. The devices were fabricated in a nitrogen-filled glove box (<0.1 ppm O2 and H2O). The thickness of films was measured using an Ambios Technology XP-2 profilometer. The active area of the device was 4 mm2. The J–V curve was measured with a computer-controlled Keithley 236 Source Measure Unit. A xenon lamp coupled with AM 1.5G solar spectrum filters was used as the light source, and the optical power at the sample was 100 mW cm−2. The EQE spectrum was measured by using a Stanford Research Systems model SR830 DSP lock-in amplifier coupled with a WDG3 monochromator and a 500 W xenon lamp. The nanoscale morphology of PTB7:ICBA:PC71BM films was observed by using an atomic force microscope (NanoMan VS, Veeco, USA) in contact mode. Hole-only or electron-only diodes were fabricated using the architectures: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au for holes and Al/active layer/Al for electrons. Mobilities were extracted by fitting the current density–voltage curves using the Mott–Gurney relationship (space charge limited current).

Broader context
Recently, indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA) was developed as a new fullerene acceptor, and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):ICBA based polymer solar cells (PSCs) exceeded 7%, which was much higher than that of the P3HT:PCBM counterpart. Unfortunately, PSCs based on low-bandgap polymer donors and ICBA acceptors yielded lower PCEs (2–4%) relative to their low-bandgap polymer:PCBM counterparts. In this work, we used ICBA as an electron-cascade acceptor material in PSCs based on the low-bandgap polymer PTB7:PC71BM blend. Due to higher LUMO energy levels of ICBA relative to PC71BM, the VOC increases with the addition of ICBA. ICBA can play a bridging role between PTB7 and PC71BM, thus providing efficient charge transfer at the D/A interface. Meanwhile, when the ICBA content is much smaller than the PC71BM content, the morphology of the ternary blend active layer is similar to that of PTB7:PC71BM, which guarantees suitable phase separation and efficient charge transport. Ternary blend devices with 15% ICBA content exhibit an average PCE of 8.13%, higher than that (7.23%) of the PTB7:PC71BM binary blend. Without any further device work (such as interlayer, invert structure and tandem cells), the ternary blend PSCs exhibit PCEs as high as 8.24%, which is the best reported for ternary blend PSCs and ICBA-related PSCs.
