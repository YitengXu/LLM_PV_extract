    , Accepted 1st November 2018First published on 2nd November 2018AbstractAnthracene-based conjugated materials have recently been developed as efficient sensitizers for applications in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Anthracene DSSCs have been reported to show an impressive high power conversion efficiency of 12.6%. This paper reports a density functional theory study on a series of metal-free fused thiophene modified anthracene dyes. The effects of fused thiophene units on the spectra and electrochemical properties of the anthracene dyes are computationally demonstrated. Our calculations show that with the sizes of the oligothienoacene units increasing from thienothiophene, dithienothiophene, to tetrathienoacene, the lowest-energy absorption peaks basically remain the same, however the oscillator strength gradually increases and the adsorption bands systematically broaden. When cyclopentadithiophene with a similar size to dithienothiophene is incorporated into the donor part, a remarkable 43 nm red-shift of the absorption peak and a broader absorption band are found, with a similar oscillator strength. The calculated ultra-fast injection time of electrons from the excited state of all anthracene dyes to the conduction band of TiO2 is ideal for DSSC applications. The newly designed anthracene dyes in this article show desirable energetic, electronic, and spectroscopic parameters for future DSSC applications.
1. Introduction
The current energy and environmental crises have stimulated more and more attention to explore renewable energy. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted significant interest in the past three decades. As an affordable renewable energy, DSSCs are low-cost substitutes to traditional semiconductor photovoltaic devices.1,2 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of DSSCs has steadily increased from 7% to 14.3% in the past two and a half decades under standard air mass 1.5 global conditions.1,3
DSSCs are typically composed of a nanoporous semiconductor thin film, dye sensitizer, redox electrolyte, counter electrode and conductive substrate. As one of the major components of DSSCs, the dye sensitizer absorbs sunlight and plays a significant role in solar energy conversion efficiency. The dyes are chemically bonded to the surface of TiO2 or other semiconductors. In recent years, metal-free organic dyes have attracted increasing interest as a substitute for metal organic complexes4,5 owing to their crucial advantages such as high molar extinction coefficient, low cost, good flexibility in molecular tailoring, and environmental compatibility.5
Donor–π bridge–anchor (D–π–A) structure dyes are commonly built in experiments. In the past three decades, novel organic dyes based on coumarin,6 triphenylamine (TPA),7 perylene,8 indoline,9 xanthene,10 squaraine,11 and merocyanine12 have been used in DSSCs. Structural modification of organic dyes has received increasing attention. Continuous development of organic dyes has brought forth new opportunities for efficient enhancement and optimization of DSSCs.13–15
Polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are composed of multiple aromatic rings with only carbon and hydrogen atoms. Organic molecules with PAH as core parts have been demonstrated to have a high molar absorption coefficient, large luminescence yield, and excellent carrier mobility.16
Researchers have synthesized novel D–π–A motif sensitizers with PAH based compounds as the central component.17 Better excited state properties and improved PEC in some PAH based dyes have been demonstrated, partially attributed to the extended π delocalization.17 Continuous innovation and development of PAH based dyes leads to new opportunities for future novel DSSCs with high efficiency.18 For example, phenanthrocarbazole-based organic dyes with complicated PAH segments as the central building blocks and high-power conversion efficiencies up to 13.0% have been reported recently.19 And in a recent paper, we studied the electronic structures, optical parameters and electron injection properties of a series of phenanthrocarbazole dyes and the dye–TiO2 interfaces.20
Anthracene-based PAH conjugated materials have been developed successfully for blue-emitting organic light-emitting diodes, and bulk-heterojunction solar cells, and etc.21–23 Recently, Wang and co-workers reported a series of efficient organic dyes with anthracene-based PAH (2H-dinaphthopentacene) as the donor core, which had PCE values larger than 10%.18,24 In a recent study by the Wang group, a blue dye R6, which features an anthracene-based PAH electron donor, was shown to display a brilliant sapphire colour in a sensitized TiO2 mesoporous film. And the R6 based DSSCs show an impressive PCE of 12.6% under standard air mass 1.5 global conditions (100 mW cm−2).24 In view of the excellent properties of the R6, the structure modification of R6 to build novel and smaller band gap anthracene dyes for the optimization of DSSCs is a meaningful and feasible method.
With structural ring planarity and extended molecular conjugation, thiophene-based conjugated compounds have moderate band gaps and show efficient electron transfer. They also possess chemical stability and good flexibility in versatile molecular tailoring.25 Recently, fused-thiophenes (thienoacenes) have been incorporated into donor–π bridge–anchor sensitizers for applications in DSSCs.26,27
In the past several decades, large-scale quantum mechanical calculations have been applied to the design and optimization of DSSCs. The high level calculations are able to accurately predict the electronic and spectroscopic properties of the dyes, not only for the interpretation of experimental data, but also for the beforehand design of novel and highly efficient sensitizers. The state-of-the-art computational methodologies based on density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) provide reliable results and reproduce the optical properties of various RuII complexes28 and metal-free organic dyes well.29–33
The aim of this paper is to conduct structural modification of the organic photosensitizer R6, as shown in Fig. 1. The PAH unit (serves as the electron donor) is composed of several parts: one diarylamine unit, two benzophenanthro units, and one fused thiophene group. 4-(7-Ethynylbenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)benzoic acid is the electron-acceptor for all the dyes considered in this paper. Specifically, we will modify the size of the oligothienoacene units connecting the two bibenzophenanthro units. In the dye R6, the connecting moiety is thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (coded as D2T here). We then enlarge the size of the oligothienoacene units to dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene (coded as D3T here) and thieno[3,2-b]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[2,3-d]thiophene (also called tetrathienoacene, coded as D4T here).
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures of the organic dyes considered in this article with different electron-donors. 
As thiophene derivatives, 4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT) and dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene show similar structures. As an effective building block, CPDT has been exploited for constructing the π-conjugated skeleton of organic sensitizers due to its excellent co-planarity and electron donating capability.34–37 We also built a novel dye with cyclopentadithiophene connecting two bibenzophenanthro units (coded as DCPDT here).
This paper will give theoretical insights into the effect of the oligothienoacene moiety on the electronic structure, optical properties and electron injection features of the anthracene-based organic dyes. We will focus on the organic dye monomer–TiO2 interface. The dyes considered in this article are named by the fused thiophene units, as shown in Fig. 1.
2. Computational details
For the ground-state geometric optimization of the pure dyes, B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) is selected due to the good performance of the geometry optimization of the organic dye derivatives. Traditional DFT methods are used to calculate the electronic properties of the dyes. For the calculation of the adsorption spectrum, we considered four commonly used functionals including B3LYP,38 MPW1K,39 BHandHLYP,40 and CAM-B3LYP41 functionals. The first three are hybrid functionals, and there is a 20%, 42.8%, and 50% Hartree–Fock (HF) exchange in B3LYP, MPW1K, and BHandHLYP, respectively. CAM-B3LYP is Handy and co-workers’ long-range-corrected version of B3LYP using the Coulomb-attenuating method. The basis set extension also affects the visible spectra, and the simultaneous addition of extra polarization, diffuse, and valence functions would lead to an obvious change of the spectra. However, extra d and f functions would result in negligible refinements.32 As a compromise between accuracy and basis set size, we chose 6-311G+(2d,2p) for the TDDFT calculations of the adsorption spectrum.
While for the prediction of the emission spectra, it has been reported that the B3LYP functional gives reliable fluorescence auxochromic shifts for some organic dye sensitizers.20,30 Since there are no experimental measurements of the fluorescence emission spectral properties of R6, we choose the B3LYP functional together with the 6-311+G(2d,2p) level of theory to simulate the fluorescence features.
The self-consistent-charge density-functional tight-binding (SCC-DFTB) theory is used to optimize the geometry of the organic dye/(TiO2)46 interacting systems. A comprehensive description of the DFTB method can be found in the literature.42–44 The full geometry optimizations were performed using the conjugate gradient algorithm until the residual forces were below 5 × 10−4 au, and the charge convergence criterion is 10−5 electrons. The carboxylic oxygen atoms of the anthracene dye were originally put almost perpendicular to the penta-coordinated surface TiV atoms, and then full geometric optimizations were performed. The DFTB method has been widely used recently to study the geometries of the dye–TiO2 interacting systems with desirable accuracies and computational efficiencies.20,30,33,45 After the geometry optimization by the DFTB method, the dye/(TiO2)46 nanoparticle systems were followed by single point electronic structure calculations as implemented in the Gaussian16 program package.46 The consistency of the results obtained from different codes is always kept under control.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Optimized structures
We first optimized the ground state structures of the four pure anthracene dyes using the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) method. The geometry optimizations show that all the four anthracene-based dyes demonstrate structural similarities, since they possess the same π-linker and acceptor moieties. The bridging benzophenanthro and anchoring groups are coplanar, which are desirable for efficient intra-molecular electron transfer. The difference in the sizes of the fused-thiophene units leads to different donor building blocks. Although the anthracene moiety and the fused thiophene units are planar, the nonplanar benzophenanthro moiety and diarylamine unit lead to nonplanar conformations of the electron donor part due to the steric hindrance. For the four anthracene based organic dyes, the dihedral angle between the fused thiophene plane and the anthracene plane is around 25–27°.
3.2. Energy level and molecular orbital patterns
The locations of the energy levels of dye sensitizers are very important. It is an important prerequisite that the locations of the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) orbitals of the dye sensitizer should match the iodine/iodide redox potential and the conduction band edge level of the TiO2 semiconductor. Here we considered the HOMO−1, HOMO, LUMO, and LUMO+1, which might be involved in the photoinduced electron transfer from the dye to the semiconductor, as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 2.

 Fig. 2  Selected energy levels and molecular orbital distribution of the anthracene dyes at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of calculations. 
The calculations demonstrated that all the HOMO levels of the four anthracene dyes are more negative than the I−/I3− redox couple (4.60 eV vs. vacuum7), which provides enough driving force for regenerating the dye cation radical efficiently. The negative HOMO of the dyes also avoids the geminate charge recombination between the oxidized dye molecules and the photo-injected electrons in the nanocrystalline titania film. Meanwhile, the LUMO levels of all the dyes lie above the TiO2 conduction band edge (4.00 eV vs. vacuum2), leading to enough thermodynamic driving force for favourable electron injection from the excited state dye to the TiO2 conduction band edge.
For the four dyes, Table 1 shows that increasing the size of the fused thiophene does not affect the HOMO and LUMO energy obviously. The HOMO and LUMO of D2T, D3T, and D4T are basically the same, and subsequently the H–L gaps for these three dyes are all around 1.71 eV. Table 1 also shows that the increase in the size of the isolated fused thiophene units has a remarkable influence on the energy levels and the HOMO–LUMO gaps. However, when incorporated into the two bibenzophenanthro units in the anthracene dyes, the variation of the thienoacene sizes does not affect the energy levels of the dyes obviously.
Meanwhile, for DCPDT with a similar size to D3T, we found that the HOMO and LUMO levels of DCPDT are 0.11 eV and 0.05 eV less negative than those of D3T, and therefore a 0.06 eV smaller band gap is found for DCPDT. The smaller band gap originates from the fused thiophene units, as listed in Table 1. The band gap of cyclopentadithiophene is 0.34 eV smaller than that of dithienothiophene, which is responsible for a smaller band gap for DCPDT.
We also considered the distribution patterns of the HOMO and LUMO of the four anthracene dyes, as depicted in Fig. 2. The HOMO is mainly populated over the diarylamine electron donor, the neighbouring bibenzophenanthro units, and the thienoacene groups. From D2T to D4T, as the size of the fused thiophene increases, the localization of the molecular pattern on the bibenzophenanthro units connecting to the ethynyl moiety decreases. The LUMO distribution is delocalized through the anchoring cyanoacrylic acid, the ethynylbenzothiadiazol group, and the neighboring bibenzophenanthro groups. The molecular orbital patterns for D3T and DCPDT are quite similar. Fig. 3 depicts the MO features of the pure fused-thiophene molecules, which reveals the extended π-conjugation as the size of fused-thiophene increases.

3.3 UV/visible and fluorescence spectral properties
Visible spectra are very sensitive to the functionals. The validity of the functionals to describe the spectral properties of the pure anthracene dyes was tested first. Table 2 shows the excitation energies of the lowest excited state λmax (nm), the oscillator strength f, and the main excitation configuration. The experimental measurement of λmax is also listed for reference. All the calculated oscillator strengths are larger than 1.1, demonstrating that the S0 → S1 transition is dipole-allowed. For all the functionals considered, the S0 → S1 transition mainly corresponds to the HOMO → LUMO excitation (larger than 60%).

Experiments24

Our calculations reveal that the excitation energies and oscillator strength are very sensitive to the functionals. The increase of the exchange HF proportion in the hybrid functionals will enhance the excitation energies of the lowest excited state λmax. Experimentally, the adsorption maximum is 631 nm (1.97 eV) in a tetrahydrofuran solution.24 The B3LYP functional predicts the lowest excitation energy to be 1.47 eV, and a large error of 0.5 eV relative to the experimental data is predicted. The B3LYP functional remarkably underestimates the lowest excitation energy for the anthracene dye.
The MPW1K function with 42.8% HF exchange shows a small deviation of 0.07 eV from the experimental data. For the long-range-corrected CAM-B3LYP functional, we show that it predicts an excitation energy very close to the experimental data, with an absolute deviation of 17 nm. Actually, the CAM-B3LYP functional has been used to simulate the excitation energies of different organic sensitizers with reliable adsorption band locations.30
Of all the functionals considered, the BHandHLYP functional with 50% HF exchange demonstrated the best performance in the prediction of the band locations of the low-lying excitations. The BHandHLYP functional almost reproduces the excitation energy of the lowest excited state from the experimental measurement, and the discrepancy is within 2 nm. Based on the agreement with the experimental data, BHandHLYP is the functional of choice for the UV/vis adsorption spectral calculation.

Table 3 lists the dipole-allowed lowest excited state, the oscillator strength, and the main excitation configuration for the four anthracene dyes considered. The adsorption properties were calculated in a tetrahydrofuran solution using a CPCM model at the TD-BHandHLYP/6-311+G(2d,2p) level of theory. Fig. 4 shows the absorption spectra for all the dyes. The unit of absorbance is cm−1 L mol−1, and the half-width at half height for the peak is set to be 0.33 eV.

 Fig. 4  Calculated absorption spectra for the anthracene dyes in a tetrahydrofuran solution. 
To produce a large photocurrent response, desirable overlapping of the dyes’ spectrum with the solar spectrum is required. And a broad UV-visible absorption covering the whole visible region and some of the near-infrared region is desirable. We found from Fig. 4 that there are two allowed excited states for the anthracene dyes: the first intense peak in the 600–700 nm region and the second peak around 350 nm. Compared to the triphenylamine45 and 4H-pyran-4-ylidene dyes47 we have studied previously, the anthracene dyes show an obvious red shift of the main adsorption peak.
In a previous work, we have studied the effects of acene units on the spectra and electrochemical properties of acene-modified triphenylamine organic dyes.30 We found that with increasing sizes of the acenes units, the absorption is systematically broadened and red-shifted, but the oscillator strength is reduced.
However, for the anthracene dyes considered in this paper, the increasing sizes of the fused thiophene units will not redshift the main adsorption peak. However the absorption is systematically broadened and the oscillator strength is enhanced, as shown in Table 3 and Fig. 4. The calculated dipole-allowed lowest excited states λmax for D2T, D3T, and D4T are 628.78 nm, 623.46 nm, and 620.32 nm, respectively. The enlargement of the fused thiophene units blue-shifted the main adsorption bands very slightly. Specifically, the incorporation of one additional thiophene ring leads to 3–5 nm blue-shift of the adsorption peak. However, the calculated oscillator strength, which is also an important parameter related to the molar absorption coefficient increased gradually. With respect to the D2T dye, the oscillator strength of D3T and D4T increases by 10% and 20%, respectively. In addition, Fig. 4 clearly shows that the absorption spectra gradually broadened as the size of the fused thiophene increased, which might also contribute to a wider spectral response.
For the second adsorption peak, a red-shift is found when the size of the fused thiophene units changed from 2T to 4T. The second peak is calculated to be 355.45 nm, 358.37 nm, 361.17 nm, for D2T, D3T, and D4T respectively.
By comparing D3T and DCPDT, we show that when cyclopentadithiophene with a similar size to dithienothiophene is incorporated to the donor part, a remarkable 43 nm red-shift of the absorption peak and a broader absorption band is found, with a similar oscillator strength.
To theoretically evaluate the possible photocurrent response properties, the light harvesting efficiency (LHE) parameter of a sensitizer is widely used. LHE is defined by Beer's law:32 LHE = 1 − 10−A = 1 − 10−f(1)where A (f) is the absorption (oscillator strength) associated with the lowest excited state. By the definition of LHE, the larger oscillator strength f contributes to a larger LHE. For the maximum photocurrent response, the LHE parameter should be as high as possible. Our calculations show that as the size of fused thiophene increases from thienothiophene, to the tetrathienoacene unit, the LHE increases from 0.991 to 0.997. The LHE of DCPDT is slightly smaller than that of D3T. The LHE values of all the four dyes are larger than 0.99, and these very large LHE parameters are favourable for a larger photocurrent response.
The fluorescence emission spectra of the dyes are also important properties to be considered in DSSC applications. It has been previously reported that the functional B3LYP predicts a reliable maximum photoluminescence wavelength.20,30 We performed TDDFT calculations with B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,2p), and the results are shown in Fig. 5. The half-width at half height for the fluorescence peak is 0.33 eV and the unit of the fluorescence is cm−1 L mol−1. We show that the vertical excitation wavelengths of the maximum photoluminescence are calculated to be 978.64 nm, 981.94 nm, 985.80 nm, and 1042.28 nm, for D2T, D3T, D4T, and DCPDT, respectively. As the size of fused thiophene increased from TT, DT, to the tetrathienoacene unit, the emission spectra did not change significantly with different donor moieties, and only a slight red-shift of the maximum photoluminescence together with an enhanced oscillator strength is found. Meanwhile, for DCPDT, a 60 nm red-shift of the photoluminescence band with a slightly increased emission intensity is revealed, compared to D3T.

3.4. Dye–TiO2 interface
The electron from the excited state organic dye injects into the semiconductor conduction band, which is a very important process in DSSCs. Therefore the microstructure and the electronic properties of the dye–semiconductor interface are of great significance towards the optimization of DSSCs. We then studied the electronic structures and the molecular features of the anthracene dye–TiO2 interface theoretically for the first time.
To reveal the TiO2 surface and the dye–TiO2 interface, the nanocluster (TiO2)46 model is in common usage.33,48 To build this cluster model, an anatase slab exposing the majority (1 0 1) surface was appropriately cut. Therefore there are 3 lines of 5-coordinated (TiV) or 6-coordinated (TiVI) titanium sites in the surface of the (TiO2)46 nanocluster. The 5-coordinated surface TiV atoms in the (TiO2)46 nanocluster will interact with the oxygen atoms on the carboxyl group of the organic dye, and therefore new Ti–O bonds will be formed at the dye–TiO2 interface. This article only studies the bidentate adsorption mode, which is energetically favourable to the monodentate counterparts. It has been reported that the dye–(TiO2)46 model and the DFTB method can be used to predict the dye–TiO2 interacting systems with desirable accuracies and computational efficiencies.30,45
The structural optimizations reveal the vertical adsorption of the anthracene dyes on the surface of titanium dioxide. Two new Ti–O bonds between the carboxylic oxygen atoms and the penta-coordinated surface Ti–IV atoms were formed. The Ti–O bond distances are in the range of 2.0–2.2 Å.
The frontier molecular orbitals patterns of the dye–(TiO2)46 systems are very important to reveal the electron-transfer features during light excitation in DSSCs. Fig. 6 shows the isosurfaces of the HOMO, LUMO, and the interacting orbitals for some anthracene dye–TiO2 systems. The isovalue is set to be 0.01 au. In Fig. 6 we show that for all the anthracene dyes considered in this paper, the MO features are quite similar: (1) the HOMO of the dye–TiO2 systems is solely located on the dye, and the molecular distributions are almost the same as the HOMO of the pure dyes. (2) The LUMO of the systems is only located on the (TiO2)46 nanoparticles. There is no molecular coupling between the dye and the TiO2. (3) The interacting LUMOs (contributions from both the free dye LUMO and the conduction band of TiO2) are situated higher up in the conduction band. Our calculations show that the interacting LUMOs are LUMO+33 for D2T–TiO2, LUMO+31 for D3T–TiO2, LUMO+31 for D4T–TiO2, and LUMO+32 for DCPDT–TiO2, respectively.
 Fig. 6  The isosurfaces for the HOMO, LUMO, and the interacting MOs for the anthracene dye–(TiO2)46 systems, respectively. The isovalue is set to be 0.01 au. 
To gain deeper insights into the optical properties of the anthracene dye–(TiO2)46 systems, we then performed TDDFT calculations on the interacting systems. Due to the complexity of the organic dye/TiO2 interacting systems under investigation and the large dimensions of the systems to be studied (more than 200 atoms), the possibility of using high-level TDDFT calculations is ruled out. In our previous paper it has been shown that the popularly used 6-31G(d) basis set predicts a reliable adsorption spectrum of organic dye–(TiO2)46 systems.45 Therefore we choose the BHandH functional and the 6-31G(d) basis set to calculate the optical properties of the dye/(TiO2)46 systems.
The calculated absorption spectra for the four anthracene dyes adsorbed on the TiO2 surface are reported in Fig. 7, where the calculated transitions have been broadened by a convolution of Gaussian functions with FWHM = 0.33 eV. Fig. 7 clearly shows that when the anthracene dyes are adsorbed on the TiO2 surface, the features of the absorption spectra basically remain the same, compared to the pure anthracene dyes (demonstrated in Fig. 4). From D2T–TiO2 to D4T–TiO2, the excitation energies for the lowest excited state blue-shifted very slightly, however, the calculated oscillator strength increased gradually. While for the DCPDT–TiO2 system, an obvious red-shift of 40 nm of the lowest excited energy is demonstrated, compared to the D3T–TiO2 system.

3.5. Electron injection time
In DSSCs there are many electron transfer processes, and the electron transfer from the excited state of dye to the conduction band of TiO2 is very important. We evaluated the electron injection time (τ, in fs) from the excited state of the anthracene dye to the conduction band of the (TiO2)46 nanocluster. A model derived from the Newns–Anderson approach38 has been considered. In this model, by measuring the full width at half maximum of the absorbate LUMO as the energetic broadening (Δ), the electron injection time (τinj) can be obtained through τinj (fs) = 658/Δ (meV)(2) (3)where pi is the adsorbate portion of every molecular orbital, εi is the orbital energy, and ELUMO(ads) is the energy of the adsorbate's LUMO. This calculation model has already been applied to study the electron injection time of some dye/TiO2 systems,49,50 and it is shown that this model provides injection time estimates, which are about one-half of the experimental ones.50
Based on the optimized dye–TiO2 geometries, we calculated the injection time of electrons from the excited state of the anthracene-based dye to the conduction band of TiO2. Our calculations showed that the injection time of electrons from the excited state of the DPP dye to the conduction band of TiO2 all fall in the femtosecond time range with the same order of magnitude. The calculated τinj parameters are 48, 34, 46, 18 fs for D2T, D3T, D4T, and DCPDT, respectively. These ultra-fast electron transfer rates are all ideal for DSSC applications.
4. Conclusions
DSSCs sensitized with anthracene dyes have recently been reported in experiments with an impressive high PCE of 12.6%. To unravel the influence of the sizes of the oligothienoacene units on the electronic and optical properties of the anthracene dyes, we report a density functional theory study of a series of fused thiophene-modified anthracene dyes. We show that with the sizes of the oligothienoacene units increasing from thienothiophene, dithienothiophene, to tetrathienoacene, the lowest-energy absorption peaks basically remain the same, however the oscillator strength gradually increases and the adsorption bands systematically broaden. When cyclopentadithiophene with a similar size to dithienothiophene is incorporated into the donor part, a remarkable 43 nm red-shift of the absorption peak and a broader absorption band is found. The calculated injection time of electrons from the excited state of all anthracene dyes to the conduction band of TiO2 is ideal for DSSC applications. The newly designed anthracene dyes D3T, D4T, and DCPDT show favourable electronic and spectroscopic parameters for future DSSC applications. Our results shed light on the design rules of anthracene based organic dyes for future DSSC optimizations.
