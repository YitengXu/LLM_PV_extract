    , Accepted 11th April 2023First published on 12th April 2023AbstractAll-polymer solar cells (APSCs) with outstanding mechanical and thermal stability are considered as having the most potential application in flexible power supply systems. However, the strong interchain entanglement between conjugated polymers generally produces active layers with poor nanoscale phase separation and low mixing entropy, thus making it difficult to control the crystallization and morphology, which severely restricts the advancement of the photovoltaic performance. Hereby, a polymer donor PBB2-H with feasible miscibility was used that could penetrate into the donor/acceptor (D/A) aggregation domains to optimize the molecular arrangement and phase-separation scale of the all-polymer active layer, so as to achieve efficient exciton and carrier utilization. The PM6:PBB2-H:PY-IT ternary APSC with a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure achieved a 17.64% efficiency and a high thickness tolerance. Interestingly, the penetration of PBB2-H could also effectively promote the formation of more mixed phases and independently optimize the D/A orderly stacking, showing a unique advantage in constructing an ideal morphology in a pseudo-planar heterojunction (PPHJ) active layer. As a consequence, the ternary APSC with the PPHJ structure obtained a champion efficiency of 17.94%, and also exhibited excellent shelf stability and photostability. Overall, this work reveals that the use of a well-miscible third component can induce orderly D/A stacking, and has great potential for helping create high-performance APSCs.

Broader context
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted wide attention due to their various advantages, such as light weight, good flexibility, and good light transmittance. With the continuous breakthrough of improved photovoltaic performance, their industrialization process is being accelerated. All-polymer solar cells (APSCs), characterized by outstanding mechanical and thermal stability, are considered as having the most potential application in flexible power supply systems. However, the strongly disordered entanglement between the polymer donors and polymer acceptors with a large conjugation length leads to unsatisfactory phase separation and molecular stacking, and is difficult to effectively regulate, resulting in a low photovoltaic performance. Herein, we employ a novel polymer donor PBB2-H with feasible miscibility to effectively penetrate into the donor/acceptor aggregation domain, and then effectively optimize the molecular arrangement and phase separation of the all-polymer active layer, so as to harvest a high PCE in BHJ- and PPHJ-based devices. These results and insights should stimulate further work on the use of well-miscible third components to induce orderly donor/acceptor stacking to aid the creation of high-performance APSCs.

Introduction
With the continuous advancements in the synthesis of photovoltaic materials and amelioration in device processing requirements, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have achieved remarkable achievements, and the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of single-junction PSCs have now exceeded 19%.1–4 Among various PSCs, all-PSCs (APSCs), in which the active layer is composed of both polymer donors and polymer acceptors have drawn extensive interest due to their exceptional flexibility, ductility, and stability.5–7 However, the performance of APSCs still lags behind their polymer/small molecule-based counterparts, which is mainly attributed to the unsatisfactory phase separation and molecular packing on account of the entanglement of the polymer chains and low mixing entropy.8–10 Accordingly, developing an effective strategy to solve the aforementioned challenges is essential for improving the performance of APSCs.
It is universally acknowledged that the properties of photoactive materials are directly related to their active morphology. The sluggish development of APSCs has mainly given rise to the absence of high-performance polymer acceptors. However, work has now accelerated with the development of the polymerized small-molecule acceptor (PSMA).11 PSMA not only inherits the merits of a narrow bandgap, strong absorption, and tunable energy level of small molecule acceptors (SMAs), but also exhibited good film-forming properties, adjustable photophysical properties, and better stability.12 With the development of high-performance Y-series SMAs, the performance of APSCs based on Y-series PSMA has rapidly exceeded 14%. In addition, the successful separation of the regio-isomeric halogenated terminals of SMA monomers has effectively solved the large divergence in the physicochemical and morphological properties, as well as allowed overcoming the former batch-to-batch performance repeatability issues,13,14 and promoted the efficiency of APSCs to now exceed 17%.15–17 Although the developed new materials have allowed significant optimization of molecular stacking and phase separation of the active layers, there is still a large gap from the ideal morphology of the active layers. In particular, the effects of the strong disorder interchain entanglement between the polymer donors and polymer acceptors with a large conjugated length on the molecular stacking and morphological regulation of the active layer have not been enlightened or resolved yet, and most APSCs still manifest a low short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF).18–20 Accordingly, there is an urgent and significant need to propose an effectual optimization scheme to break the inherent overly strong intermolecular aggregation and entanglement in all-polymer systems and to simultaneously enhance the orderly stacking of molecules in the active layer to achieve a higher PCE.
Normally, additive thermal annealing (TA) and solvent annealing (SVA) strategies are frequently used to regulate the molecular stacking and morphology of the active layer.21–23 However, the current situation of a low variety of additives and insufficient control of TA and SVA cannot significantly and effectively optimize the all-polymer active layer, which limits the promotion of the JSC and FF. Notably, a ternary strategy has been widely reported to improve the performance of PSCs owing to its simplicity and effectiveness.24–26 Here, the introduction of an ideal third component can not only act as a photon compensator and morphology modifier, but also enables different working mechanisms (charge transfer, energy transfer, parallel, or alloy-like models) with the host system, ultimately allowing delivering higher performance PSCs.27–29 However, in the vast majority of the reported ternary APSCs to date, the commonly used third components struggle to break the strong polymer pre-aggregation, resulting in a negligible improvement of the FF (Table S1, ESI†). Therefore, to achieve a breakthrough in APSC performance, effectively regulating the accumulation of donors/acceptors (Ds/As) and inducing the orderly stacking of molecules would be needed to guide the exploration of an appropriate third component and to clarify its mechanism of action.
In this work, a novel polymer donor PBB2-H as the third component was introduced in an efficient host system (PM6:PY-IT) to obtain a high-performance APSC. The benign compatibility of PBB2-H with PM6 and PY-IT could allow it to effectively penetrate into the pristine aggregation domains to regulate the phase-separation scale and morphology of the active layer. In addition, PBB2-H could also enhance the ordered molecular stacking of the active layer, which would be conducive to charge transfer and extraction. After adding 20 wt% PBB2-H, the efficiency of a PM6:PBB2-H:PY-IT ternary rigid APSC with the BHJ structure was improved to 17.64% (thin-film) and 16.56% (thick-film), and the corresponding flexible device also showed increased efficiency too to 15.46% (thin-film) and 14.98% (thick-film), respectively. More interestingly, the ternary rigid thin-film APSC with the PPHJ structure obtained a champion PCE of 17.94%, and also showed excellent shelf stability and photostability. These results confirmed that a well-miscible third component could induce orderly D/A stacking, manifesting great potential for the construction of high-performance APSCs.
Results and discussion
Chemical structures of the photoactive materials (PM6, PBB2-H, and PY-IT) are displayed in Fig. 1(a), and the detailed synthesis procedure and characterization of PBB2-H are given in the ESI.† The cyclic voltammetry (C–V) curve of PBB2-H is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), and the energy levels of all the photoactive materials are depicted in Fig. 1(b). It can be seen that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of PBB2-H was −5.45 eV, consistent with the host donor PM6 (−5.45 eV), which could allow maintaining the original high open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the related photovoltaic devices. Fig. 1(c) shows the normalized absorption spectra of PM6, PBB2-H, and PY-IT neat films, and the wide bandgap donor PBB2-H exhibited strong absorption in the range of 450–600 nm, and good absorption complementarity with PM6 and PY-IT. Moreover, the absorption spectra of PM6:PY-IT, PM6:PBB2-H:PY-IT and PBB2-H:PY-IT blend films were also obtained, as presented in Fig. S2 (ESI†). After adding 20 wt% PBB2-H in the donors, the absorption spectrum of the PM6:PBB2-H:PY-IT blend film was obviously enhanced in the range of less than 600 nm, which is beneficial to capture short-wavelength photons. To further research the working mechanism between PBB2-H and PM6, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the neat and blend donor films were measured, as depicted in Fig. 1(d). With the increased PBB2-H contents, the intensity of the PL peak located at the PM6 position gradually increased, indicating that PBB2-H transferred energy to PM6.30

For investigate the compatibility of PBB2-H with host materials, the contact angles of water (H2O) and diiodomethane (CH2I2) droplets on neat and blend films were measured, as presented in Fig. 2(a), and the surface energy (γs) and Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χ) are summarized in Table 1. It could be clearly observed that the contact angles and γs of PBB2-H were situated between PM6 and PY-IT, indicating their good miscibility with each other. The χ parameters of different materials can be calculated from the equation .31–33 The χ values between PBB2-H and PM6 or PY-IT were 0.15 k and 0.09 k, respectively, which were significantly smaller than that of χPM6:PY-IT (0.49 k). These results show that the introduction of PBB2-H was more likely to penetrate into the strongly original aggregation between the host donor and acceptor. To better evaluate the intermolecular interactions of different materials, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements of neat and blend materials were performed, as depicted in Fig. S3 (ESI†). There were no defined exothermic transitions observed in the PY-IT and PM6:PY-IT blend, while the PM6:PBB2-H:PY-IT blend showed an obvious exothermic peak at 251.2 °C, which was located between PM6 (265.1 °C) and PBB2-H (230.2 °C), further proving that PBB2-H was well miscible with the host materials and could optimize the molecular stacking.34–36

In order to gain insights into the effect of PBB2-H addition on the intermolecular interactions of the host materials, density functional theory (DFT) simulations were performed by the DFT B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2SVP algorithm.37 The optimized geometries of PBB2-H, PM6, and PY-IT are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), and the intermolecular stacking modes in the most stable equilibrium state are depicted in Fig. 2(b). It can be seen intuitively that PBB2-H, PM6, and PY-IT showed a favorable flatness, which is conducive to orderly intermolecular stacking. The stacking distance between PM6 and PY-IT was smaller than that between PM6 and PM6 (3.43 Å vs. 3.52 Å), and the complexation energy between PM6 and PY-IT was significantly greater than that between PM6 and PM6 (−48.27 kcal mol−1vs. −28.52 kcal mol−1). This result indicated that the host donor was prone to forming an overmixed active layer, which would have an adverse impact on the formation of phase separation with an appropriate domain size.38 It is worth noting that PBB2-H and PM6 exhibited a smaller stacking distance of 3.41 Å and larger complexation energy of −42.55 kcal mol−1. In addition, PBB2-H and PY-IT also exhibited a smaller stacking distance of 3.46 Å and stronger complexation energy of −57.07 kcal mol−1. The complexation energy between PBB2-H and PY-IT was closer to the maximum complexation energy between PY-IT and PY-IT (−58.21 kcal mol−1), which was more conducive to PBB2-H acting on PY-IT molecular stacking. The calculation results show that the introduction of PBB2-H could simultaneously penetrate into the D/A aggregation to regulate the intermolecular stacking and morphology of the active layer.
To further explore the effect of PBB2-H addition on the ordered stacking of the host PM6 and PY-IT, two-dimensional grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS) patterns were implemented as shown in Fig. 2(c), and the line-cut profiles are depicted in Fig. 2(d). Compared with the PBB2-H neat film with intense (010) diffraction peak in out-of-plane (OOP) diffraction, the weak diffraction peaks of the PM6 and PY-IT films indicated their inferior crystallinity. All the films presented typical face-on orientations with conspicuous π–π diffraction patterns in the OOP direction. After adding 20 wt% PBB2-H, the PM6:PBB2-H and PY-IT:PBB2-H blend films exhibited a significantly enhanced (010) diffraction peak in the OOP diffraction, indicating the enhancement of intermolecular π–π stacking. These results further confirmed that the introduction of PBB2-H could simultaneously optimize the orderly stacking of the host photoactive materials, which would be conducive to charge transfer and thus could realize an improved APSC performance.
To investigate the effect of PBB2-H addition on device performance, a series of APSCs were prepared with the BHJ structure, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The detailed optimization processes are listed in Table S2 (ESI†). The J–V curves of the optimized binary and ternary thin-film APSCs are presented in Fig. 3(a), and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. The PM6:PY-IT-based thin-film APSC exhibited a PCE of 16.27%, with a JSC of 23.56 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.935 V, and FF of 73.69%. The PBB2-H:PY-IT-based thin-film APSC exhibited a PCE of 13.55%, with a JSC of 19.89 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.937 V, and FF of 72.71%. Both PM6 and PBB2-H could work efficiently with PY-IT, ensuring that the performance of the corresponding ternary APSCs would not be too deteriorated. After adding 20 wt% PBB2-H in the donors, the PCE of the PM6:PBB2-H:PY-IT-based ternary thin-film APSC increased to 17.64%, with a JSC of 24.69 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.936 V, and FF of 76.34%. The increased JSC could be attributed to the enhanced photon capture of the active layer and optimized charge transfer with the addition of PBB2-H. Then external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were utilized to further explore the reason for the improved JSC values, and the EQE spectra of the binary and ternary thin-film APSCs are depicted in Fig. 3(c). Compared to the PM6:PY-IT-based binary APSC, the EQE spectrum of the PM6:PBB2-H:PY-IT-based ternary thin-film APSC was significantly improved, especially in the range of less than 550 nm. Moreover, the photon response of the ternary APSC also showed a significant enhancement around the wavelength of 800 nm, implying that the introduction of PBB2-H optimized the molecular stacking of the acceptors. The integrated JSC values calculated from the EQE spectra were consistent with the J–V measurements. What's more, the significantly improved FF could be ascribed to the optimized intermolecular stacking and morphology with the introduction of PBB2-H.

In order to better explore the influence of molecular stacking optimization on the thickness sensitivity of the active layer, rigid thick-film APSCs based on PM6:PY-IT and PM6:PBB2-H:PY-IT were fabricated, and the J–V curves and corresponding photovoltaic parameters are given in Fig. 3(d) and Table 2, respectively. The optimized ternary rigid thick-film APSC exhibited a PCE of 16.56%, with a JSC of 24.84 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.921 V, and FF of 72.33%, which were significantly higher than that of the binary thick-film APSC. Notably, the 16.56% efficiency is one of the highest values reported by APSCs to date. As can be seen in Fig. 3(e), statistical distribution histograms were applied to identify the performance difference between the binary and ternary thick-film devices. Given the above-mentioned experimental data, it could be inferred that the reason for retaining the high efficiency and low thickness sensitivity of the ternary thick-film APSC was due to the introduction of PBB2-H optimizing the charge transport and collection.39,40 A low thickness sensitivity of the active layer also plays a vital role in the preparation of high-performance flexible APSCs.41–43 Therefore, a series of flexible APSCs were prepared as depicted in Fig. S6 (ESI†), and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table S3 (ESI†). The PCE of the PM6:PBB2-H:PY-IT-based ternary flexible thin-film APSC was 15.46%, which was evidently higher than that of its PM6:PY-IT-based binary counterpart (13.30%). Furthermore, the PCE of the ternary flexible thick-film device increased from 13.12% to 14.98%. The photovoltaic performance was well maintained in the ternary flexible APSCs due to the improved JSC, without sacrificing more FF, which was basically consistent with the trend observed in the rigid devices. The above studies proved that the optimized intermolecular stacking and morphology caused by the introduction of PBB2-H played an important role in the improvement of device performance.
To investigate the effect of the introduced PBB2-H on the charge-transport dynamics, the mobility was measured by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method with hole-only and electron-only special device structures. The measured curves and corresponding values are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†) and Fig. 3(f). The hole mobility (μh) of the PM6:PY-IT-, PM6:PBB2-H:PY-IT-, and PBB2-H:PY-IT-based blend films were 7.6 × 10−4, 8.7 × 10−4, and 6.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1, and the corresponding electron mobilities (μe) were 5.8 × 10−4, 7.1 × 10−4, and 4.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S-1, respectively. The enhanced μh and μe of the ternary blend film could be mainly attributed to the addition of PBB2-H to enhance the orderly intermolecular stacking, which facilitates charge transfer and extraction. In addition, the more balanced charge transport of the ternary blend film was also one of the major reasons for the higher FF.44,45 These findings further explain the reduced thickness sensitivity in the ternary APSCs.
In order to evaluate the effect of PBB2-H introduction on exciton dissociation and charge collection, photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) curves of the binary and ternary APSCs are shown in Fig. 4(a), and the key parameters are listed in Table S4 (ESI†). All the characterizations were presented by rigid thin-film devices. The saturated photocurrent density (Jsat) of the PM6:PBB2-H:PY-IT ternary APSC (25.19 mA cm−2) was higher than that of the host binary APSC (24.72 mA cm−2), which could be mainly attributed to the fact that the introduction of PBB2-H enhanced photon capture. The exciton-dissociation efficiency (ηdiss) and charge–collection efficiency (ηcoll) of APSCs can be approximately calculated by Jph/Jsat under the short-circuit and maximum output power status.46 The ηdiss of the PM6:PY-IT-based binary APSC was 96.8%, and the ηdiss of the PM6:PBB2-H:PY-IT-based ternary APSC was improved to 98.0% after adding 20 wt% PBB2-H in the donors. The enhanced ηdiss could be attributed to the optimization of phase separation and the accelerated exciton-dissociation rate (Fig. S8, ESI†). In addition, the ηcoll was also enhanced from 82.9% for the PM6:PY-IT-based binary APSC to 89.0% for the PM6:PBB2-H:PY-IT-based ternary APSC, with the enhanced ηcoll indicating a more efficient charge extraction and suppressed charge recombination. Hence, the jointly increased ηdiss and ηcoll of the ternary APSC were in favor of improving the JSC and FF.

Charge-recombination properties can also be illustrated by the dependence of JSC and VOC on light intensity (Plight), as shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). The fitting s values of the PM6:PY-IT- and PM6:PBB2-H:PY-IT-based APSCs were 0.954 and 0.975, respectively, and the fitted n values were 1.29 and 1.18 kT q−1. The values of s and n of the ternary APSC were closer to unity, indicating that the charge trap-assisted recombination and bimolecular recombination could be effectively suppressed, further elucidating the improvement of the FF.47–49 In addition, the transient photocurrent (TPC) and transient photovoltage (TPV) were also measured to further investigate the charge-transport dynamics of the APSCs, as presented in Fig. 4(b) and (c). The fitted charge lifetimes (τrec) of the PM6:PY-IT- and PM6:PBB2-H:PY-IT-based APSCs were 18.90 and 22.19 μs, respectively. The longer charge lifetime of the ternary APSC further indicated that the charge recombination loss was effectively suppressed by introducing PBB2-H. The fitted charge-extraction time (τext) of the PM6:PBB2-H:PY-IT-based ternary APSC was 8.24 μs, which was distinctly shorter than that of the PM6:PY-IT-based binary APSC (22.42 μs). The faster charge extraction could be attributed to the optimization of orderly molecular stacking in the ternary active layer.
To further explore the effect of PBB2-H on the molecular arrangement of the active layer, 2D-GIWAXS diffraction patterns of the binary and ternary blend films were measured, as shown in Fig. 4(d)–(f), and the line-cut profiles are depicted in Fig. 4(g). For the PM6:PY-IT blend film, a distinct (010) diffraction peak at 1.71 Å−1 in the OOP direction and a (100) diffraction peak at 0.32 Å−1 in the in-plane (IP) direction could be observed from the line-cut profiles, indicating that the molecules in the active layer trended toward a face-on orientation. After adding 20 wt% PBB2-H in the donors, we could clearly observe that the (010) diffraction peak in the OOP direction and the (100) diffraction peak in the IP direction of the ternary blend film were significantly enhanced. This indicated that the intermolecular π–π stacking could be effectively enhanced, which would be conducive to charge transfer in the ternary active layer. In addition, the crystalline coherent length (CCL) values of the blend films were calculated from the (010) peak of the OOP direction, and the relevant data are summarized in Table S5 (ESI†). The CCL of the PM6:PBB2-H:PY-IT-based ternary blend film was 20.38 Å, which was higher than that of PM6:PY-IT (17.74 Å) and PBB2-H:PY-IT (19.50 Å). All these results further confirmed that the introduction of PBB2-H promoted the orderly stacking of polymers, which also corresponded to the increased mobility in the ternary active layer mentioned above.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were carried out to analyze the effect of PBB2-H addition on the morphology of the active layer, as presented in Fig. 4(h)–(j). The PM6:PY-IT blend film was quite smooth with a low root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.57 nm. After adding 20 wt% PBB2-H, the RMS roughness value of the PM6:PBB2-H:PY-IT blend film was almost unchanged (1.57 nm), which could be attributed to the excellent compatibility between PBB2-H and the host materials. Notably, the PM6:PBB2-H:PY-IT blend film showed a more pronounced nanofiber network structure and ideal phase separation scale than that of the binary blend film from the TEM images. The changes in the film morphologies stemmed from the fact that PBB2-H regulated the intrinsic molecular interactions, thereby affecting the aggregation of the ternary blend film. The optimized phase separation and morphology were also indispensable for the ternary APSC to obtain a high JSC and FF.
As mentioned in the above experimental results, the introduction of PBB2-H in the BHJ active layer synergistically optimized the orderly intermolecular stacking and morphology, thereby enhancing charge transport and extraction, and enabling achieving a high device efficiency. Recently, the reported results show that devices based on the PPHJ structure exhibit superior performance over devices based on the BHJ structure.50–53 The excellent miscibility between PBB2-H and the host materials can effectively control the surface energy, which is conducive to forming more mixed phases in the active layer of the PPHJ structure. In addition, the introduction of the guest donor PBB2-H has also been proved to enhance the ordered molecular stacking of PM6 and PY-IT, respectively (Fig. 2). Therefore, inspired by these dual positive effects of the guest donor PBB2-H, it could be possible to obtain better phase separation and molecular stacking in APSCs with the PPHJ structure, which could ensure avoiding excessive disordered stacking caused by overmixed donors and acceptors in the BHJ structure, and thus obtaining improved device efficiency. Schematic diagrams of PBB2-H as the guest donor to regulate microstructures in the host active layer (D/A) of BHJ and PPHJ structures are presented in Fig. 5(a).

To verify the effect of PBB2-H introduction on the morphology of the PPHJ active layer, AFM images of PPHJ-based binary and ternary blend films were obtained, as shown in Fig. 5(b). The RMS roughness value of the PPHJ-based ternary blend film was 1.35 nm, which was smaller than that of the PPHJ-based binary blend film (1.41 nm), and it also showed a more obvious nanofiber network structure. This result could be attributed to the excellent miscibility between PY-IT and PBB2-H, which was verified by the surface energy measurements, and permitted homogeneous molecular intermixing as a foundation for the molecular packing and vertical phase separation variations.54 In addition, from the 2D-GIWAXS images of the PPHJ-based blend films (Fig. 5(c)), the (010) diffraction peak in the OOP direction and (100) diffraction peak in the IP direction of the PPHJ-based ternary blend film were significantly enhanced compared to that of the PPHJ-based binary blend film, indicating that the introduction of PBB2-H effectively enhanced the intermolecular π–π stacking, which is beneficial to the charge transfer in the ternary active layer.
The J–V curves of the PPHJ-based optimal binary and ternary APSCs are shown in Fig. 6(a), and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters and the optimization process are listed in Table 3 and Table S6 (ESI†), respectively. The bottom (PM6) and top (PY-IT) based binary APSCs with the PPHJ structure exhibited a PCE of 16.62%, with a JSC of 24.24 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.924 V, and FF of 74.22%. With the increased PBB2-H content in the bottom and top of the PPHJ active layer, the efficiency of the ternary APSCs increased first and then decreased. The ordered stacking and morphology of the PPHJ active layer could be precisely modified by optimizing the PBB2-H content in the bottom layer (PM6) and top layer (PY-IT), respectively. As a result, when the ratio of the bottom PM6:PBB2-H and top layer PY-IT:PBB2-H was 10:1.5/7:0.5, the PPHJ-based ternary APSC obtained a champion PCE of 17.94%. In order to clarify the improvement of device performance, the mobilities of the PPHJ-based binary and ternary blend films were measured by the SCLC method, as shown in Fig. 6(b) and Fig. S10 (ESI†). The hole and electron mobilities of the PPHJ-based ternary blend film were 11.2 and 9.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1, respectively, which were significantly higher than that of the PPHJ-based binary blend film (10.5 and 8.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1). The improved mobility could be attributed to the introduction of PBB2-H optimizing the vertical phase separation and inducing orderly molecular stacking of the active layer. The more balanced charge mobility (1.14 vs. 1.26) further explained the improvement of the FF. Moreover, from the TPC and TPV curves in Fig. 6(c) and (d), the fitted charge lifetime and charge extraction times of the PPHJ-based ternary APSC were 24.71 and 5.29 μs, respectively, which indicated a faster charge extraction and less carrier recombination than for the PPHJ-based binary and BHJ-based APSCs. All these results support the potential of introducing a third component with good compatibility for independently optimizing orderly D/A stacking, and preparing high-performance PPHJ-based organic photovoltaics.

The stability of the APSC is also an extremely important requirement. The shelf stability and photostability were thus measured as shown in Fig. 6(e) and (f). The PPHJ-based ternary APSC could maintain 90% PCE for 30 days without encapsulation in a nitrogen-filled glove box, which was higher than that of the BHJ (85%)-based device. Moreover, after 24 h of simulated AM 1.5G sunlight with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2, the PPHJ-based ternary APSC could maintain 93% PCE, which was also higher than that of the BHJ (90%)-based device. The improved shelf stability and photostability of the PPHJ-based ternary APSC could be attributed to the high crystalline domain and suitable vertical phase separation, which could effectively inhibit the morphological change.55,56
Conclusions
In summary, we revealed an effective method to independently induce orderly D/A stacking, and reported high-efficiency and high-stability APSCs by incorporating PBB2-H to finely tune the regioregularity of the polymers. After adding 20 wt% PBB2-H, the efficiency of the PM6:PBB2-H:PY-IT-based ternary rigid APSC with the BHJ structure was improved to 17.64% (thin-film) and 16.56% (thick-film), and the corresponding flexible device also showed increased efficiencies to 15.46% (thin-film) and 14.98% (thick-film), respectively. Noteworthy, the good miscibility of PBB2-H supported it to independently optimize the orderly D/A stacking, such that when the ratio of the bottom PM6:PBB2-H and top layer PY-IT:PBB2-H was 10:1.5/7:0.5, the PPHJ-based ternary APSC reached a champion PCE of 17.94% with a high FF of 77.45%, and it also showed excellent shelf stability and photostability. These results demonstrate that the use of a well-miscible third component to induce orderly D/A stacking has great potential in the construction of high-performance and stable APSCs.

Broader context
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted wide attention due to their various advantages, such as light weight, good flexibility, and good light transmittance. With the continuous breakthrough of improved photovoltaic performance, their industrialization process is being accelerated. All-polymer solar cells (APSCs), characterized by outstanding mechanical and thermal stability, are considered as having the most potential application in flexible power supply systems. However, the strongly disordered entanglement between the polymer donors and polymer acceptors with a large conjugation length leads to unsatisfactory phase separation and molecular stacking, and is difficult to effectively regulate, resulting in a low photovoltaic performance. Herein, we employ a novel polymer donor PBB2-H with feasible miscibility to effectively penetrate into the donor/acceptor aggregation domain, and then effectively optimize the molecular arrangement and phase separation of the all-polymer active layer, so as to harvest a high PCE in BHJ- and PPHJ-based devices. These results and insights should stimulate further work on the use of well-miscible third components to induce orderly donor/acceptor stacking to aid the creation of high-performance APSCs.
