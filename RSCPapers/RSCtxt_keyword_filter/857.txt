1. Introduction
Niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5) is a metal oxide with great potential but to date this has yet to be fully realized. Interest in Nb2O5 can be dated back to the early 1940s when the polymorphs of Nb2O5 were first studied.1,2 Nb2O5 has many polymorphic forms which gives rise to an interesting series of structural phases. The phases are generally based on NbO6 octahedral groups, forming various configurations from the rectangular blocks or columns.3 Nb2O5 is relatively abundant in nature and has high corrosion resistance as well as being thermodynamically stable.4–6
In the very early stages of research on Nb2O5, this material was mostly studied in bulk or thin layer forms as well as in suspensions.7–9 The very first applications of Nb2O5, as a functional material, were investigated as catalysts, sensors and in electrochromism.10–17 The unique performance of Nb2O5 in such studies was due to an understanding of its energy band diagram and the identification of crystal phases, which created the initial interest among researchers to explore more of this metal oxide's capabilities. Nb2O5 has grown in popularity in recent years and a variety of morphologies ranging from large size bulk crystals to different nanostructures have been reported.18–25 In particular, nanostructured Nb2O5 offers high surface to volume ratios and quantum confinement effects that enable unique physical and chemical interactions to occur at the surface. As a result, such morphological manipulations significantly influence the optical and electronic properties of Nb2O5 leading to unique observations that are not seen in its bulk forms. Similarly, the chemical and physical properties of Nb2O5 can also be modified via other routes such as the incorporation of foreign ions, alteration of the crystal phase and post synthesis heat treatment.26–28
More recently, attention on Nb2O5 has gained more momentum due to applications other than electrochromism and catalysis. Especially, thin films and nanostructured Nb2O5 have been utilized in batteries, solar cells and other electronic devices such as memristors.20,29–31 However, most of these investigations are still in their infancy and much more research should be conducted to explore the true capabilities of Nb2O5 in these and other applications. Thus, more comprehensive studies on Nb2O5 should be conducted to provide further insight for researchers who intend to use this material for such applications.
In this review article, we present a broad review on Nb2O5 that includes its fundamental properties, synthesis methods and applications. Many of the common methods for synthesizing thin films and nanostructures of Nb2O5 are presented with a separate emphasis on liquid and vapour phase techniques. We summarize a selection of interesting applications that exploit Nb2O5 as the core material. In the final section, future outlooks on the possibilities to expand the areas of research and investigations using this material are elucidated.
2. Fundamental properties
In the following section, an overview of the basic properties of Nb2O5 including crystal structure, electronic band diagram and electrical properties are presented. The fundamentals of the optical, mechanical and thermal properties of Nb2O5 are also discussed.
2.1 Crystal structure
Nb2O5 is a transparent (due to its large band gap), air-stable and water-insoluble solid material with a relatively complicated structure that displays extensive polymorphism.32 There are almost 15 polymorphic forms of Nb2O5 that have so far been reported, however, the most common crystal phases are generally pseudohexagonal (TT-Nb2O5), orthorhombic (T-Nb2O5), and monoclinic (H-Nb2O5).3,27,32,33 As shown in Fig. 1, after any relatively low temperature synthesis route amorphous Nb2O5 is normally obtained and then crystallizes at ∼500 °C into TT or T phases, at medium-temperature (∼800 °C) transforms into the M phase (tetragonal), and above ∼1000 °C it forms the H phase.34 Despite this general temperature effect, the method of preparation, the nature of the starting material and the presence of impurities as well as interactions with other components also play decisive roles in the formation of the resulting Nb2O5 crystal.3,34 H-Nb2O5 is the most thermodynamically stable crystal phase and is always produced when heated to temperatures above 1000 °C, while the TT- and M-Nb2O5 forms are mostly metastable.3,35 It is important to mention that in some reports, Nb2O5 crystal phases have been re-designated as γ = T, β = M, and α = H.32 However, there are still many inconsistencies regarding the identification of Nb2O5 crystal phases. Some investigators suggested that the M is simply disordered H phases34 whereas M-Nb2O5 has been reported as a tetragonal Nb2O5 phase by Mertin et al.35

Some of the crystallographic properties of the different crystal phases of Nb2O5, with reference to their associated literature, are presented in Table 1. The unit cells of TT-, T- and H-Nb2O5 crystals are shown in Fig. 2. A unit cell of TT-Nb2O5 contains half of the formula equivalent with a constitutional defect of an oxygen atom per unit cell (Fig. 2a).36 Each niobium (Nb) atom is at the center of four, five or six oxygen atoms on the ab-plane and an Nb–O–Nb–O chain structure exists along the c-axis. As a result, the oxygen deficiency leads to the distortion of these polyhedra. Meanwhile, the T-Nb2O5 phase is constructed with the orthorhombic unit cell where each Nb atom is surrounded by six or seven oxygen atoms, creating distorted octahedra or pentagonal bipyramids (Fig. 2b and d).36,37 The polyhedra are connected by edge- or corner-sharing in the ab-plane and by corner-sharing along the c-axis.36 The TT and T phases of Nb2O5 have quite similar X-ray diffraction patterns where the main difference is that some reflections that are split in T-Nb2O5 occur as one peak in the XRD patterns of the TT-Nb2O5 phase.32,34 The broadening of peaks in TT (or the splitting of the corresponding peaks in T) is due to the occupancy of niobium atoms in separate, but closely-spaced, equivalent sites in the T form, giving rise to the split peaks observed from certain reflections, and the ability of Nb to occupy either of these sites or places between the TT form, resulting in broadening of the same peaks in XRD patterns of TT.34 These observations suggest that TT-Nb2O5 is a less crystalline form of T-Nb2O5, stabilized by impurities such as OH−, Cl−, or oxygen vacancies.34 The monoclinic lattice of H-Nb2O5 contains ReO3 type blocks of 3 × 4 and 3 × 5 groups containing NbO6 octahedra (Fig. 2c and e).36,38,39 These blocks are coupled by edge-sharing with a shift of half a unit cell dimension along the c-axis. NbO6 units are connected by corner-sharing with each other within a block.36 One of the 28 Nb atoms in each unit cell is present in a tetrahedral site, which occurs at some block junctions.32,40 M-Nb2O5 has similarity with the H-Nb2O5 crystal structure, which contains 4 × 4 of ReO3 type blocks.3,35 This was concluded from the close relationship of the X-ray powder diagram of the M- and H-forms, which agree in a large number of reflections.3

2.2 Band energy diagram and electrical properties
In electronic device development based on metal oxides, several properties of the incorporated materials are of utmost importance. These include the band energy diagram, electrical conductivity and dielectric permittivity. Nb2O5 is a wide band gap n-type semiconductor with a conduction band comprised of empty Nb5+ 4d orbitals and has a conduction band value that is 0.2–0.4 eV higher than titanium dioxide (TiO2).41 Its band gap energy (Eg) values have been reported to be in the order of 3.1 (semiconducting) to 5.3 eV (insulating with conductivity of σ = ∼3 × 10−6 S cm−1).42–44 The ability to tune the band gap of Nb2O5 is possible and factors such as stoichiometry, crystallinity, heat treatment and incorporated foreign ions can dramatically influence the band gap energy. Previous studies have also shown that decreasing the dimensions of Nb2O5 into the nanoscale results in a blue shift of the energy gap, which can be attributed to the quantum-size effect.45 Significantly, nanostructured Nb2O5 possesses grain dimensions that can critically influence the electronic structure of the material.46
Le Viet et al. experimentally determined the band gap of crystalline Nb2O5 nanofibers (hexagonal, orthorhombic and monoclinic) which had been sintered at three different temperatures (500, 800 and 1100 °C).27 Based on the Tauc plots derived from the absorption spectra in Fig. 3a, they found that the hexagonal (labelled as H-Nb2O5), orthorhombic (labelled as O-Nb2O5) and monoclinic (labelled as M-Nb2O5) forms of Nb2O5 exhibited band gaps of 3.85, 3.77 and 3.79 eV, respectively.27 Meanwhile, Abe reported that the powder-synthesized orthorhombic Nb2O5 had a band gap value of 3.4 eV, while that of monoclinic Nb2O5 gave a reported value of 3.1 eV.26 Moreover, the same author also investigated the effect of doping on the energy band gap of Nb2O5 by incorporating different concentrations of germanium (Ge) in the monoclinic Nb2O5 films. The optical absorption edge of the monoclinic Nb2O5 which is derived using the Kubelka–Munk function was observed at 3.1 eV without Ge doping which shifted up to 3.35 eV as the Ge concentration was increased.26 The incorporation of tungsten and molybdenum into Nb2O5 has also been reported as well as the treatment of Nb2O5 with hydrogen peroxide in order to manipulate the band gap of Nb2O5.47

Recently, Liu et al. fabricated single-crystalline nanoporous Nb2O5 nanotubes using a two-step solution route; the growth of uniform single-crystalline Nb2O5 nanorods and the following ion-assisted selective dissolution along the [001] direction.48 The band gap of Nb2O5 nanotubes and nanorods are 3.97 and 3.72 eV, respectively (Fig. 3b). As mentioned previously, the 0.25 eV difference was due to the blue shift of the absorption edge for the porous nanotubes compared to solid nanorods which is due to the quantum size effect in hollow Nb2O5 nanotubes.48 The same effect was also observed by Brayner et al. in the transmission spectrum of Nb2O5 particles: a significant blue shift of the absorption edge was observed and therefore the band gap increased from 3.4 eV to 4.2 eV, as the particle size of Nb2O5 decreased from about 40.0 nm to 4.5 nm.49 The effect of grain size on the band gap of Nb2O5 was also presented by Agarwal et al.,50 although they suggested that the energy of the absorption edge is influenced by both the size and local coordination of the grains.
In Nb2O5, like other semiconductors, the concentration of charge carriers is directly related to the defect structure of the metal oxide which is dependent on temperature and oxygen pressure.59 Greener et al. conducted a detailed analysis of the relation between conductivity of α-Nb2O5 (monoclinic) and temperature under ambient oxygen pressure.60 As presented in Fig. 4, they showed that an increase in temperature and decrease in oxygen partial pressure increased the conductivity of α-Nb2O5. These results are in excellent agreement with the measurements by Kofstad and Chen et al.61,62

To scale down the physical dimensions of integrated circuits, investigating of high-κ (high permittivity) materials is important for reducing the leakage current in integrated capacitors and gate insulators. Based on experimental measurements and first-principles calculations, Clima et al. reported that the relative dielectric permittivity of sol–gel deposited Nb2O5 to be 77 for the orthorhombic phase, 58 for the δA-hexagonal phase and 38 for the δB-hexagonal phase.63 They found that the dielectric constant of Nb2O5 strongly depended on the crystal structure and the inspection of the permittivity tensors revealed that the dielectric constants are anisotropic. More recently, Nb2O5 thin films were grown by atomic layer deposition using novel precursor chemistry for metal–insulator–metal (MIM) capacitors with a relative permittivity of 28.64 However, after annealing at 650 °C, the films' relative permittivity values increased to 45–50 due to the enhanced crystallinity of the films. In addition, Cavigliasso et al. reported that the dielectric constant of Nb2O5 films created electrochemically by electrooxidation depended on the electrolyte used, and resulted in dielectric constant values over the range of 49 to 120.65
Electronic mobility is another important parameter in semiconductor device development especially for field effect transistors (FETs). A mobility value of 7 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 for α-Nb2O5 at a temperature of 1200 °C was reported by Yahia.66 Further, it has been shown that the mobility is increased by increasing the temperature.
2.3 Optical properties
As mentioned in Section 2.2 the band gap of Nb2O5 ranges between 3.1 and 5.3 eV. As a result, Nb2O5, depending on its crystallinity and grain morphology can efficiently absorb light in the near UV and UV regions of the spectrum or it can be used as a transparent material to UV light. Nb2O5 has been identified as being capable of reversible and rapid coloration in the presence of intercalating ions such H+ and Li+ ions. It has been reported that this phenomenon can modulate the Nb2O5 optical transmission from a quasi-transparent state (T ∼ 85%) to less than T ∼ 10% in the ultraviolet (UV), visible or near infrared (IR) range, and can exhibit either a blue or brown colour depending on the crystallinity of the film.17,67–69
The optical properties of Nb2O5 have been experimentally studied via various techniques such as spectrophotometry and spectroscopic ellipsometry.70–73 The refractive index value of Nb2O5 films has been reported to be in the order of 2 to 2.3.71,73 Also the crystallinity of the film plays a significant contribution to the refractive index of the material as it decreases from 2.30 to 2.20 after being annealed from room temperature to 700 °C.70
2.4 Mechanical properties
Besides electronic and optical properties, an investigation of the mechanical properties of Nb2O5 is also of major importance for the fabrication of electronic devices especially for the development of flexible mechanical devices and actuators such as micro electro-mechanical system (MEMS) devices. Stress or strain commonly occurs in thin films depending on the deposition process and constraints imposed by the substrate. The average hardness (H) and Young's modulus (Er) values of as-sputtered Nb2O5 films have been reported to be in the order of 5.6 to 6.8 GPa and 117 to 268 GPa respectively, which is again influenced by the crystal phase.70,74
In flexible device applications, the bending test is essential to perform in order to monitor the effects of stretching on the device output and to make sure that all the component layers are stable even after several thousand flexes. Some of the appropriate flexibility tests and other related mechanical tests for electronic devices have been described in detail elsewhere.75–78 Hota et al. have demonstrated that sputtered Nb2O5 thin films (∼50 nm thickness) on flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates show high mechanical flexibility in a repetitive bending test.79 A collapsing radius test, which is one of the common bending test techniques, was applied to MIM capacitors based on sputtered Nb2O5 thin films, and the obtained results show endurance of up to 2500 flexes.
2.5 Thermal properties
In an electronic system, heat dissipation is an acute problem due to miniaturization and the increasing power of microelectronic circuits. Thus, thermal conductor materials with high thermal conductivity and a low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) are essential for the purpose of heating and cooling. For Nb2O5, a limited number of studies have been carried out on its thermal properties. An investigation of the high-temperature thermal expansion of monoclinic Nb2O5 was conducted using X-ray and dilatometric techniques by Manning et al.80 The results revealed that the lattice thermal expansion of Nb2O5 is anisotropic where the mean coefficients in the a, b, and c directions were 5.3 × 10−6, 0 and 5.9 × 10−6 per °C, respectively. Previous works also demonstrated the low thermal expansion behaviour of Nb2O5 over the temperature range of 20 to 1000 °C.81,82 In addition, another report demonstrated a negative thermal expansion of Nb2O5 at relatively high temperatures as large as 500 °C (ref. 83 and 84) which was attributed to the recombination of the microcrack network formed during cooling. There are just a few reports regarding the Seebeck coefficient of Nb2O5.85 It has been reported that its Seebeck coefficient changes from −0.5 to −1.2 mV per °C when the temperature changes from 500 to 1000 °C.
3. Synthesis of Nb2O5
Nb2O5 has been synthesized using many approaches and the key motivation in choosing the right synthesis method is its capability in tuning the properties of Nb2O5 (mostly crystal phase and morphology). In this section, we have chosen the most common synthesis methods and classified them into two major categories: liquid and vapour phase based. In addition, complementary methods are also presented.
3.1 Liquid phase deposition methods
Liquid phase techniques include methods such as hydrothermal, anodization, sol–gel and electrodeposition. These methods are chosen due to their low capital cost, relatively low operating temperatures and high control over Nb2O5's properties in comparison to vapour phase deposition techniques, which is crucial for the fabrication of cheap and low-heat-tolerant substrates.

3.1.1 Hydrothermal and solvothermal methods. 
Hydrothermal (in water) and solvothermal (in other solvents such as acetone and isopropyl alcohol) synthesis techniques are simple methods that have been utilized to produce metal oxide crystals. These methods involve an ionic source of metal in a solution which is heated at an elevated temperature for a certain period of time. For the deposition of Nb2O5, the solution of Nb5+ ions is sourced either via the interaction of niobium metal in an acid or base or the dissolution of a niobium salt such as niobium chloride, niobium ethoxide, or ammonium niobium oxalate (see Table 2). The solvents are then heated at a temperature in the range of 100–600 °C for duration of a few hours to several days (see Table 2). Normally, this process allows the nucleation and growth of naturally crystalline Nb2O5 to proceed. Nanostructured Nb2O5 such as nanorods, nanobelts, nanospheres and other configurations are also possible to be synthesized using these hydrothermal or solvothermal methods. A brief summary of the type of nanostructured Nb2O5 that can result from such methods is presented in Table 2. Fig. 5 presents a selection of the type of Nb2O5 nanostructures that have been achieved using a few selected hydrothermal or solvothermal methods. Due to the high-aspect-ratio properties and high surface area that can be obtained, these methods offer great potential for obtaining Nb2O5 that can be used in various specific applications including lithium-ion batteries, dye-sensitized solar cells and photocatalysis applications which will be explained in the later sections.38,86–89

3.1.2 Anodization method. 
Anodization is one of the most widespread nano-fabrication methods due to its capability of forming highly porous and ordered oxide morphologies.90,91 In a typical anodization experiment, a potential is applied between two electrodes; a working and counter electrode, which are both immersed in a liquid electrolyte. An electrical current or voltage is then applied, which results in electrochemical reactions occurring on the surface of the metal electrode (working electrode) and an oxide film is formed. The growth and morphology of the anodic oxide film strongly depends on the applied anodization potential, the composition of the electrolyte (aqueous, organic solvent with or without water and etching agent content), the electrolyte temperature, and the anodization duration. The as-anodized Nb2O5 films are mainly amorphous and require a post-annealing treatment to be converted into highly crystalline and stoichiometric Nb2O5.
Studies on anodic Nb2O5 films have been conducted as early as the 1960s. Draper et al. presented work that was undertaken to study the anomalies in published work on the structure of the anodic films formed on niobium (Nb) and how the physical nature of the film material might influence the growth rate.92 Later, a study on anodic Nb2O5 film properties (i.e., resistivity, dielectric constant) was presented by Wood et al.93 Other early studies on anodized Nb2O5 surface morphology and crystallization analysis using an electron microscope, electron-beam crystallization and reflection electron diffraction have been reported elsewhere.94,95
The anodization of Nb has been intensively studied in various electrolytes (sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, NaOH, Na2CO3, HF, glycerol, ethylene glycol, fluoride, and phosphorus based solutions). Most of the reported anodic Nb2O5 films consist of highly nanoporous structures on a Nb foil substrate.96–103 In one of the most important reports, conducted by Habazaki et al., the effect of water content on the formation of porous Nb2O5 anodized in a K2HPO4–glycerol electrolyte as well as at elevated temperature was discussed.96 They showed that by reducing the water content to 0.08 mass%, the porous film growth rate markedly increased (as thick as 28 μm) at 160 °C, which is associated with the increased field strength by a higher concentration of phosphorus species. Ou et al. later reported the creation of a three dimensional (3D) vein-like nanostructured network in an electrolyte consisting of ethylene glycol with NH4F and small content of water (∼4%) (Fig. 6a).23 In all of these processes, an elevated temperature was applied based on the hypothesis that it increases the ion diffusion rate during the anodization process.

Apart from a nanoporous structure, microcones were also obtained by Nb anodization in an electrolyte containing deionized water with a low concentration of HF or in a glycerol electrolyte containing K2HPO4.104–107 Wei et al. reported anodized nanotubes of Nb2O5 up to 4 μm thick by optimizing the anodization of Nb in an NH4F based glycerol electrolyte.108 Recently, Lee et al. reported the first anodization procedure to produce highly ordered nanochannels of Nb2O5 grown in glycerol containing K2HPO4 electrolyte also at 180 °C.109 They showed that the channel length could be adjusted from a few hundred nm to several tens of μm. Lee et al. were successful in growing films of thick nanochannels of Nb2O5 by pre-heating the electrolyte at 200 °C before conducting the anodization in order to reduce the water content.109 Other reports on anodic nanochannelled Nb2O5 films were also reported by Abdul Rani et al. (Fig. 6b).22 Moreover, reports on nanoporous Nb2O5 films and nanochannelled Nb2O5 films obtained from anodizing Nb films, which were RF sputtered on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates, have also been demonstrated recently (Fig. 6c and d).69,110,111


3.1.3 Sol–gel methods. 
The sol–gel process is a simple wet-chemical method that involves the conversion of selected monomers into a colloidal solution (sol). The sol acts as the precursor for the formation of an integrated network (or gel) which can be eventually used for creating discrete particles or connected networks.112 The deposition of the final oxide films using a sol–gel process is normally conducted by methods such as dip- or spin coating, electrospinning, or drop-casting. Despite its simplicity, there are some limitations as well. The bonding can be weak, resulting in inhomogeneity in subsequent films. There are also certain difficulties in controlling the reaction rate and porosity.113–115
The preparation of Nb2O5via sol–gel methods was first reported by Alquier et al. in 1986.112,116 The typical precursors used for Nb2O5 films synthesised via sol–gel processes are quite similar to the hydrothermal or solvothermal methods, containing a mixture of niobium salt and its solvent. The sol–gel Nb2O5 films generally require a post-annealing treatment in order to induce crystallinity. Schmitt et al. have reported a sol–gel based Nb2O5 thin film by dissolving NbCl5 powder in butanol and acetic acid.68 The Nb2O5 films were deposited by dip-coating and then annealed at 400–600 °C to obtain the TT crystal. Similar procedures have also been demonstrated by other researchers using different precursors such as niobium ethoxide and ammonium niobium oxalate.4,29,67,117–125 As can be seen from Fig. 7a–c, films consisting of nanoparticle structures are normally obtained by dip or spin coating deposition techniques.121,124 Different structural morphologies of Nb2O5 have been demonstrated by Le Viet et al. using electrospinning which resulted in Nb2O5 nanofibers as shown in Fig. 7d–f.27 These nanofibers were synthesized from a polymeric solution prepared from polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and niobium ethoxide in ethanol and hydrolyzed using acetic acid.

3.1.4 Electrodeposition. 
Electrodeposition can be considered as a common method for the fabrication of nanostructured materials in the form of thin films, powders and composites.126 This process often involves a two electrode configuration immersed in an electrolyte, where a metal oxide film forms at the cathode in contrast to the anodization method described in Section 3.1.2. The aqueous electrolyte used for Nb2O5 electrodeposition generally contains niobium ions and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).127,128
In one of the very first electrodeposition reports, Zhitomirsky performed electrodeposition by applying a constant current density of 20 mA cm−2 at 1 °C for 20 min in an electrolyte mixture of NbCl5 and H2O2.126,127 The produced Nb2O5 thin films exhibited microporosity with a thickness of 0.3 μm, were crack free and adhered well to the substrate. Non-aqueous electrolytes can also be used in electrodeposition but they need to have some supporting electrolyte to allow the conduction of current. Kamada et al. added 0.01 M iodine (I2) and bromine (Br2) into acetone as an electrodeposition electrolyte to obtain Nb2O5 films.25 Although the addition of I2 into acetone induced anodic oxidation of the metal anode, subsequent electrochemical dissolution and cathodic deposition did not take place. The addition of Br2 has been found to promote both anodic dissolution and electrodeposition of Nb species.

3.2 Vapour phase deposition
In general, vapour phase deposition is a process to fabricate layers of materials from the condensation of their vaporized sources under favourable environments. There are two major categories of vapour phase deposition: physical vapour deposition (PVD) and chemical vapour deposition (CVD).

3.2.1 Physical vapour deposition (PVD). 
PVD techniques are used for depositing a wide variety of films with thicknesses which vary from a few angstroms to several millimetres. The deposition of a film is through the evaporation of the precursors into a vapour phase by physical approaches such as ion bombardment, heat, electron beam or laser irradiation followed by the condensation of the vapour phase onto the required substrate.129,130
So far, sputtering has been the most reported PVD technique to deposit Nb2O5 films. Generally, Nb2O5 films can be obtained using direct current (DC)72,131–136 or radio frequency (RF)18,132,137–143 sputtering techniques with metallic niobium (Nb)72,131,133–135,138–142,144–146 or Nb2O5 (ref. 18, 137 and 143) targets in the presence of carrier gases such as argon (Ar) in oxygen (O2) environments. These techniques are capable of producing Nb2O5 films or nanostructured forms with preferred dimensions, crystallinity, nanoscale grain sizes and morphologies by controlling the deposition parameters (i.e.; pressure, distance between the target and the substrate, substrate temperature, discharge voltage, RF power) during the sputtering process.147 Post-annealing treatment in a controlled gas environment is usually used to enhance the crystallinity of the sputtered films. Even though sputtering can produce high-quality films, this technique is time consuming due to its low deposition rates (typically in the μm per hour range).148
In addition to sputtering, other PVD techniques have been established to fabricate Nb2O5 films such as ion-beam assisted deposition,70,71,149,150 thermal evaporation,151 pulsed magnetron sputtering145,152 and pulsed laser deposition (PLD).20,153–155 Pulsed magnetron sputtering and PLD have been found to increase the deposition rate of Nb2O5 films to the order of tens of microns per hour and are also able to conserve the original stoichiometry of a bulk target to the deposited film.148,153 It is also possible to obtain high aspect ratio nanostructures such as nanobundles that have been shown by Ghosh et al. using PLD process (Fig. 8).20

3.2.2 Chemical vapour deposition (CVD). 
CVD techniques are also commonly used in the formation of films (in particular conformal coatings) and nanostructures.156,157 Nb2O5 thin films (nanostructured and compact) have been successfully synthesized using CVD techniques such as metal–organic CVD (MOCVD),158,159 plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD),160 atmospheric pressure CVD (APCVD),161,162 and vapour–liquid–solid (VLS) growth mechanisms under vacuum or atmospheric conditions.163
Generally, to deposit the Nb2O5 films, precursors such as NbCl5 and pentaethoxy niobium [Nb(OC2H5)5] are transported using reactant/carrier gas species into the reaction chamber, and subsequently decomposed on the surface of a heated substrate.160
O'Neill et al. showed that the Nb2O5 film growth strongly depended on the substrate temperature when deposited by the CVD reaction of NbCl5 with ethyl acetate.161 At lower temperatures (400–500 °C), the resultant films tended to be uniform, forming layered growths. Deposition at temperatures higher than 500 °C produced hazy films with fairly uniform columnar nanostructure associated with Volmer–Webber growth throughout the films. At 600 °C a milky appearance was observed, which was attributed to the films being comprised of uniform inter-grown rods that were virtually all aligned perpendicular to the substrate surface. These results indicated that the changes in the morphology of the films with substrate temperature were related to the number of nucleation sites available and the delivery rate of the precursor.161 In another approach, the initial niobium pentaisopropoxide [Nb(OiPr)5]2 precursor was decomposed at 950 °C onto polycrystalline alumina substrates, which resulted in one-dimensional monoclinic Nb2O5 nanorods.163 Other studies using CVD methods offer excellent alternatives to produce layered Nb2O5 especially for fibre coating applications.158,162
Furthermore, spray pyrolysis which is a typical aerosol-assisted CVD is among one of the most well utilized methods to synthesis thin or thick Nb2O5 films.19,175–178 This method has the capability of forming large-scale thin films by using a simple apparatus with large productivity. With regard to the substrate temperature, a post annealing treatment is usually required to obtain highly crystalline Nb2O5 films if a low temperature is applied during the deposition.

3.3 Thermal oxidation
Thermal oxidation is a simple fabrication technique. The starting material to fabricate Nb2O5 is normally Nb metal/foil or powder, and then the thermal oxidation is performed by heating the sample in a furnace at a temperature as high as 1000 °C generally in a O2 or oxidizing rich environment.16,21,55,179–183 The technique forces the oxidizing reagent to diffuse into the substrate at a high temperature and react with it. The nanostructured Nb2O5 is directly grown onto the surface of a Nb substrate. The resultant structures can vary from compact films to nanowires and core–shell structures. It has been reported that nanowires as long as 20 μm can be produced by this approach.180,182 The growth of these nanostructures can be controlled by optimizing the temperature, time, metal-catalyst and gas atmosphere during the synthesis process.184
4. Applications
Applications of Nb2O5 normally involve the utilization of some unique properties of Nb2O5 such as its electronic and optical properties or biocompatibility which may be enhanced by the modification of Nb2O5 films such that they significantly enhance the performance of a device. In the following sections, some of the most common applications of Nb2O5 that have been reported in the literature are presented.
4.1 Solar cells and light emitting diodes
Nb2O5 films are promising candidates for developing different types of optical devices, including solar cells based on dye-sensitized and heterojunction architectures as well as light emitting diodes (LEDs).
Since their discovery by Grätzel in 1991, dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been extensively studied as they offer the potential for clean, reliable, cost effective and on-site energy generation.185 Increasing the efficiency of DSSCs depends on improving every single element in their structure, including: photoanode, dye, electrolyte and counter-electrode. However, the development of the most suitable photoanode will still have the most significant impact on the DSSCs's performance.185 Nb2O5 has recently drawn considerable attention as a promising photoanode in view of its wider band gap (due to its higher conduction band edge) as well as comparable electron injection efficiency and better chemical stability in comparison to titanium oxide (TiO2).23,41,186 These properties of Nb2O5 can potentially enhance the DSSCs' efficiency by increasing the open circuit voltage (Voc) and photoconversion efficiency (η).187
Several studies have been reported on the synthesis of Nb2O5 photoanodes which were obtained using hydrothermal, chemical anodization, sol–gel coating and PLD techniques.17,20,22,23,38,110,167,188–190 The details are summarized in Table 3. To date, the highest conversion efficiencies of more than 6% have been exhibited by devices with a hydrothermally grown Nb2O5 photoanode with the optimum thickness of ∼11 μm.38 Ou et al. and Rani et al. have established an anodization method to obtain Nb2O5 nanovein-network photoanodes with large surface areas and low number of impurity defects for DSSCs.23,110 The photoanodes with no detectable impurities exhibited longer electron lifetimes, indicating more suitability in preventing charge recombination and possible enhancement of the conversion efficiency (Fig. 9). However, the efficiency of the overall devices incorporating these photoanodes was still relatively low (∼3.5 to 4.1 %) which was attributed to the lack of the optimisation of the thickness of the Nb2O5 frameworks.

Additionally, several researchers have applied Nb2O5 films as a blocking layer in DSSCs. Thin Nb2O5 films fabricated by spray pyrolysis, sputtering, sol–gel and dip coating methods have been used as potential blocking layers between the contact electrode and the TiO2 layer, improving the Voc which created a better conversion efficiency for TiO2 based DSSCs.176,191–194 Furthermore, it has been shown that a Nb2O5 film could play an essential role in increasing the efficiency of the DSSCs as a layer between the TiO2 photoanode and electrolyte.195–197 This increase was attributed to the coating which either prevented the recombination of electrons and holes due to the barrier effect or the change in the energy level of the TiO2 conduction band.197 However, other investigations have disregarded those factors and claimed that the improvement in the performance of the cell could be attributed to an enhancement in the charge injection efficiency promoted by Nb2O5.195 Nb2O5 has also been incorporated as a counter electrode in DSSCs. Wu et al. and Lin et al. have reported a significant conversion efficiency between 4.65 to 5.82% in DSSCs using a Nb2O5 counter electrode with a TiO2 photoanode.198,199 In these studies, the types of gases used during the annealing treatment and changes in crystallinity of the Nb2O5 counter electrode were reported as a factor that influenced the DSSCs' efficiency.
For polymer based bulk heterojunction solar cells, Nb2O5 thin films commonly act as electron transport layers.200,201 It has been found that Nb2O5 films are compatible with and have good adhesion properties to many polymer layers.200
Wiranwetchayan et al. reported that very thin Nb2O5 films between the electron collecting electrodes and active layers were necessary to promote the formation of continuous uniform active layers and thus blocking the holes in those layers from being recombined with the electrons in the collecting electrode.201 However, further investigations of such polymeric solar cells should be considered in order to obtain higher conversion efficiencies.
The capability of Nb2O5 films have also been studied in LED applications.203,204 Su et al. applied Nb2O5 and SiO2 films as high and low refractive indices of omnidirectional high reflector (ODR) in white LEDs, respectively.204 The Nb2O5 and SiO2 pair was chosen due to their high transparencies in the visible and UV wavelength ranges.71,204 They observed that the leaked UV light escaping from the white LED is completely blocked and remarkably enhanced visible light extraction (400–750 nm) of the white LED which incorporated ODR packaging was enhanced with an average enhancement of 15% in luminous intensity.
4.2 Sensing devices
Like other metal oxides such as TiO2 and zinc oxide (ZnO), Nb2O5 has shown great potential to be used as a sensing material. Sensor devices based on Nb2O5 for gas, humidity, biological and chemical sensing as well as photodetection have been successfully demonstrated. Generally, the main parameters for good sensing device performance are the size, morphology, aspect ratio, intergranular connectivity, porosity, surface energy, stoichiometry and surface area to volume ratio of the incorporated sensing material.205,206
In 1983, Kondo et al. reported the first Nb2O5 gas sensors for O2.207 Before the nanostructured form of Nb2O5 had been introduced in a gas sensor, generally techniques such as RF magnetron sputtering was used to deposit dense Nb2O5 films.15,208–210 Several studies applied metal catalysts such as platinum (Pt) and palladium (Pd) onto the surface of Nb2O5, which could promote chemical reactions between the target gas and the oxide film and consequently, increase the sensing capability.55,211,212 The types of sensing methods or principles that have so far been reported were mainly based on conductometric, voltammetric, chronoamperometric and Schottky contact sensors15,55,208,209,211–220 Depending on the type of gas species, reducing or oxidizing, the interaction between the gas molecules and the Nb2O5 films changes the charge carrier concentration and the potential barrier of the Nb2O5 films. These affect the physico-chemical property of the films corresponding to the gas constituents exposed to the sensor. So far, the investigated gases that have been examined using Nb2O5 are O2, hydrogen (H2), dissolved O2, carbon monoxide (CO), ammonia (NH3) and a number of hydrocarbons (HCs).15,55,208,209,211–220 An example of a H2 Schottky based gas sensor based on a Nb2O5/Pt contact and the dynamic responses of this device is presented in Fig. 10. For humidity sensing, pellet type Nb2O5 sensors have been explored by Yadav et al.221 More recently, Fiz et al. have synthesized single-crystalline Nb2O5 nanorods and SnO2/Nb2O5 core–shell heterostructures by CVD method.163 The results have demonstrated that the growth of the nanoscopic Nb2O5 overlayer on SnO2 nanowires introduced defects in the structure, which influenced the electronic properties of the material and enabled the design of more efficient sensor.

Due to the chemical stability and corrosion resistance of Nb2O5, the material has also been explored for pH and ascorbic acid measurements.5,222 Furthermore, Nb2O5 has also been used as a working electrode in electrochemical based DNA biosensors.223,224
Beside gas, chemical and biological sensing, it has been demonstrated that Nb2O5 with its wide band gap and long electron life time, is a good candidate for making fast ultraviolet photodetection systems.225 Fang et al. have shown that a photodetector based on individual Nb2O5 nanobelts resulted in a high external quantum-efficiency (EQE) of >6000%.226
4.3 Batteries and supercapacitors
The development of energy storage devices based on lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and supercapacitors have created great interest among researchers and Nb2O5 is certainly a favorable material for creating such storage devices.227–230 Developing devices that can store sustainable energy with long term stability, very prolonged cycle life and meeting environmental constraints as well as safe operating potential windows (in the range of 1.0 ≤ V ≤ 3.0 V vs. Li+/Li) are the main goals of this field.
The study of Nb2O5 as an electrode material for lithium ion cells started in the early 1980s.231,232 The observations by Reichman et al. demonstrated that Nb2O5 can undergo intercalation with Li+, leading to the possibility of repeated charging and discharging.231 Subsequently, a LIB based on a Nb2O5 cathode was studied extensively by the Kumagai group.183,232–239 The structural changes of the Nb2O5 cathodes which are caused by discharging and recharging were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analysis methods.183,232 They suggested that tetragonal-Nb2O5 exhibited the best cycling performance with a large discharge capacity of 190 mA h g−1 for up to 30 cycles. XRD analysis suggested that the orthorhombic- and tetragonal-Nb2O5 maintain their original crystal lattices, accompanying a small change in the cell volume even after Li+ intercalation. However, the two-dimensional layered structure of tetragonal-Nb2O5 was suggested to be the best for accommodating a large concentration of the intercalating ions.183 Investigations of Nb2O5 LIBs using several electrolytes and different amounts of graphite in the electrodes have also been reported.239 It was observed that the discharge capacity decreased with a decrease in the graphite content, and declined to 20–120 mA h per gram oxide in the graphite content range 0–10 wt%. Furthermore, there are also reports on the application of sputtered Nb2O5 as a LIB electrode (Fig. 11a and b).236,238 Nakazawa et al. reported a battery with a sputtered Nb2O5 negative electrode of 100 nm thickness showed the most favourable charge–discharge properties with a capacity of 310–380 mA h cm−3 for 500 cycles.238

Obviously the incorporation of nanostructured Nb2O5 should enhance the performance of LIBs. Nb2O5 nanobelts were the first nanostructured Nb2O5 to be used as an electrode material in LIBs which reported a potential window of 3.0–1.2 V (vs. Li+/Li).240 LIBs made of Nb2O5 nanobelts demonstrated a high reversible charge–discharge capacity, high rate capability with excellent cycling stability as large as 180 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles which could work smoothly even at a high current density of 10 Ag−1. Le Viet et al. reported LIBs based on three different polymorphs of Nb2O5 nanofibers prepared by an electrospinning method and annealing treatment.31 Among pseudohexagonal-, orthorhombic- and monoclinic-Nb2O5 nanofibers, the monoclinic based LIB showed the highest capacity, lowest capacity fading and good cycling stability. In addition, Li et al. demonstrated that Nb2O5 nanocrystals coated with a thin layer of a homogeneous carbon shell as an electrode demonstrated a relatively long cycle life (130 mA h g−1 after over 300 cycles) by preventing the Nb2O5 volume change and pulverization during the charge–discharge process.87 A study on Ta-substituted Nb2O5 nanofibers and Nb2O5 nanocomposites with various vanadium oxide contents – based LIBs have also been discussed elsewhere.119,241 A report on a battery based on a Nb2O5 anode with a KS-6 graphite cathode showed it to be an inherently safe energy storage system due to no oxygen release from the cathode materials, no lithium dendrite formation and no possibility of overcharge from the electrode/electrolyte reaction.242 However, the cell capacity and cycling stability of such devices are still considered to be low.
Sasidharan et al. demonstrated a LIB based on Nb2O5 hollow nanospheres which can deliver a high capacity of 172 mA h g−1 after 250 cycles of charge–discharge that maintained electrode structural integrity with an excellent cycling stability even after exposing it to a high current density of 6.25 Ag−1.24 In this work, the enhanced LIB's performance was attributed to the hollow cavity coupled with the nanosized Nb2O5 shell domain that facilitated fast lithium intercalation/deintercalation kinetics. Meanwhile, anodic Nb2O5 electrodes for LIB applications have been reported by Yoo et al.102 The discharge capacity of 53 μA h cm−2 was obtained at 800 nm thick Nb2O5 without a surface dissolution layer at a potential window of 1.2–3.0 V. Experiments were also conducted by Rahman et al. using LIB electrodes based on vein-like nanoporous networks of anodic Nb2O5 mixed with acetylene carbon black.103 The device exhibited a reversible capacity of 175 mA h g−1 even after 300 cycles at a current density of 0.4 Ag−1 and a potential window of 1.2–3.0 V (Fig. 11c and d). This work also demonstrated an excellent reversible discharge capacity at a high current density of 2.6 Ag−1.
In comparison to batteries, supercapacitors (SCs) offer significantly higher power densities with longer cycling life and fast charging. However, the main shortcoming of SCs is their low energy density, due to the restricted storage capacity as a result of the limitation of the size of the electrodes. One possible strategy to address these challenges is to develop high energy density electrodes. The effect of Nb2O5 crystallinity on the capacitive response of SCs has been reported by Kim et al.243 Augustyn et al. have shown that thick electrodes of up to 40 μm offer the promise of exploiting intercalation pseudocapacitance to obtain high-rate charge-storage devices.244 Another study on understanding the origin of high-rate intercalation pseudocapacitance in Nb2O5 crystals was presented by Lubimtsev et al.245
So far, incorporation of carbon with Nb2O5 to fabricate a composite SC electrode has been considered as one of the most effective solutions in developing high energy density electrodes.246 Wang et al. developed a SC electrode that consisted of CNT networks intimately mixed with Nb2O5 nanocrystals to generate a SC with a high capacitance, excellent rate capability as well as cycling capability.247 The intimate contact between the nanocrystals and the CNTs enabled fast electron transport and increased current, while the small dimensions of the nanocrystals shortened the lithium-ion diffusion length.
4.4 Catalysts
Nb2O5 in its pure form has been used as a high temperature catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of organic materials in their gaseous form such as methane to formaldehyde and propane to propene.28,248 In addition, other reports have demonstrated that Nb2O5 could serve as an efficient catalyst for the transesterification of β-keto esters with several kinds of alcohols, leading to good conversion at acceptable yields.249 It has been suggested that the catalytic performance of each polymorphic form of Nb2O5 differs significantly from one another. However, Nb2O5 has commonly been used with other metal oxides/metals due to the following properties that it offers to the composite catalyst:250−252 (i) promotion and support properties: Nb2O5 enhances catalytic activity, selectivity and prolongs catalyst life when a small amount of this oxide is added to known catalysts, (ii) acidic property: the surface acid strength of hydrated Nb2O5 exhibits high catalytic activity, selectivity and stability for acid catalysed reactions in which water molecules participate, and (iii) redox properties and photosensitivity: Nb2O5 in mixed oxides is an oxidant and demonstrates photosensitivity.
Similar to its pure form, Nb2O5 has also been used together with other metal/metal oxide for the dehydrogenation of organic compounds in their gaseous forms.250,251,253–255 Cherian et al. investigated a Nb2O5 supported chromium oxide (Cr2O3) catalyst for the ODH of propane to propene which demonstrated more than 80% selectivity in a temperature range of 673–723 K.254 They also claimed the Nb2O5 support did not degrade the propene as much as Al2O3 and TiO2 supports. The ODH of propane was also investigated by the addition of 1 to 20 wt % of Nb2O5 in Pd/Al2O3 catalysts (Fig. 12).256 Similar catalytic properties have also been shown for other metal oxide compounds with Nb2O5 including Re2O7, CrO3, WO3, MoO3, and V2O5.257

Nb2O5 has also been utilised as a photocatalyst. Under illumination, Nb2O5 produces electron/hole pairs that can generate hydroxyl radicals (˙HO) from water, which are able to undergo further reactions in solution. Such photocatalytic applications have been successfully demonstrated for water splitting and degradation of harmful organic contaminants.47,89,258–263 Increased photocatalytic activity was achieved by forming Nb2O5 nanostructures such as mesoporous, electrospun nanofibers, nanorods and nanospheres as a result of their high surface area.258,262 The addition of metal particles (i.e., Pt, Au, Cu) and metal oxides (i.e., CuO, NiO) into a Nb2O5 photocatalysts can delay the electron and hole recombination rate which enhances reduction reactions and improves the hydrogen production rate.259,260 Furthermore, carbon incorporation is also an effective technique to enhance photocatalytic activity. This is due to the capability of the carbon to modify the surface chemical composition of Nb2O5 and extend its absorption into the visible light range.262
4.5 Electrochromic devices
Electrochromism is the ability of a material to change its transparency upon exposure to stimuli. Electrochromic (EC) materials are at the core of a variety of applications including smart windows for architectural and automotive industries as well as optical displays.264–266 An ideal EC material should have high initial transparency, large optical contrast between coloured and bleach states, short switching time, and long-term cyclic stability.267
Nb2O5 has an excellent potential for the development of EC systems. It has multicolour capabilities and it also shows long-term cyclic stability due to its relatively large band gap.268,269 To date, the best EC ever reported has been for elevated temperature anodized Nb2O5 showing values as large as 47.0 cm2 C−1 at an applied potential of −1.5 V for samples of 500 nm thickness (Fig. 13).69 Other studies of EC systems based on Nb2O5 films using other synthesis techniques including sol–gel, thermal oxidation, chemical vapour deposition and pulse-laser deposition have also been reported elsewhere but resulted in lower ECs.16,29,67,118,153,269–272

4.6 Other applications
Nb2O5 has also been reported for applications other than those presented in Sections 4.1 to 4.5. As highlights, Nb2O5 has been incorporated in electronic devices such as memristors, capacitors, and field-effect transistors (FETs).
Highly crystalline orthorhombic Nb2O5 nanofibers obtained by electrospinning have been used in the development of memristors.273 Reproducible bipolar resistive switching with an ON–OFF resistance ratio as high as 2 × 104 was observed in individual fibers. Hota et al. investigated the performance of Pd nano-dots (NDs) embedded in Nb2O5 memristors by scanning tunnelling microscopy.30 From the current–voltage measurements, the memristors showed non-volatile memory and bipolar resistive switching characteristics. They claimed that the inclusion of Pd NDs played a critical role by acting as oxygen ion reservoirs and/or by polarizing a large volume of oxygen vacancies.30 In addition, non-volatile resistive switching behaviour was also demonstrated at anodic Nb2O5 based memristors (in the configuration of Au/Nb2O5/Nb/Si sandwich memory cells).274 The devices exhibited reproducible performance with a resistance ON–OFF ratio of ∼103.
Meanwhile, an interesting report on a capacitor based on Nb2O5 was presented by Garcia et al., who investigated the influence of the growth and annealing temperatures on the electrical properties of Nb2O5 based MIM capacitors.64 The obtained results show that the permittivity values exceeded 50 for the films crystallized after annealing at temperatures higher than 500 °C. However, the leakage current values for the crystalline films were higher than those in the case of amorphous films.
It has also been shown recently that Nb2O5 can be used in FETs by Kao et. al.275 The gain of the device could be readily controlled via the gate voltage modulations. The same group also showed the incorporation of such a FET as transducers for pH and biosensing.
5. Conclusion and future outlook
In this comprehensive review, we have presented the fundamental physical and chemical properties of Nb2O5, focusing on crystal structure and its electrical, optical, mechanical and thermal properties. In addition, we also discussed the various techniques that have been used to synthesize various forms of Nb2O5, and the most commonly reported applications incorporating Nb2O5 were summarized.
It was highlighted that Nb2O5 is found in a variety of crystal phases. The most common phases that are observed include pseudohexagonal, orthorhombic and monoclinic. There are still many unsubstantiated statements regarding the crystal structures of Nb2O5, especially when sub stoichiometry is present, thus more rigorous crystal phase analysis should be conducted to shed light on such conflicting arguments. Tetragonal Nb2O5, which is an unstable crystal structure between the orthorhombic and monoclinic phases, is still not well understood and less explored, which may present an opportunity for future research.
The reports regarding band energy diagrams, and as a result, the electronic and optical properties of Nb2O5 were presented. The mechanical and thermal properties of Nb2O5 were also discussed. However, it was hinted that many fundamental topics such as the Seebeck coefficient, thermal conductivity and carrier mobility of Nb2O5 have been rarely studied opening great avenues for future investigations.
Numerous synthesis techniques of Nb2O5 were briefly discussed in this review. It was seen that there exists a wide range of nanostructured Nb2O5 that have been successfully synthesized including nanoporous, nanosheets, nanorods, nanochannels, and nanowires, among others. However, a variety of other Nb2O5 morphologies have yet to be explored and fully characterized. We also believe that simple synthesis methods and low cost production routes should be investigated in more detail.
We have described numerous applications of Nb2O5 in catalysis, electrochromic devices, batteries, sensors and solar cells. However, many of these studies are still in their infancy and require further exploration. For example, in solar cell applications, Nb2O5 has received relatively little attention compared to materials such as TiO2 and ZnO even though theoretically, Nb2O5 in both dye sensitized and heterostructure systems can offer enhanced efficiency. Furthermore, Nb2O5 in transistor, memristor and superconductor devices has been less studied compared to other metal oxides. There are certainly significant chances for further investigations of the capabilities of these devices through the exploitation of nanostructured Nb2O5.
Since Nb2O5 demonstrates excellent mechanical flexibility and durability as well as fantastic electronic and optical properties, one should consider the opportunity for its use in microelectro-mechanical systems (MEMS) and sensors, especially in combination with microfluidics and biomedical devices. There are many more applications that can be considered and comprehensive studies using Nb2O5 in many relevant fields should be encouraged, since its capability in many applications has not yet been examined.
