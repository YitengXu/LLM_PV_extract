    , Accepted 1st April 2019First published on 1st April 2019AbstractThree new π-conjugated semiconductors of the type D–π–D, A–π–A (symmetric), and D–π–A (asymmetric) were constructed on fluoreno-thiophene spacer by permutation of the lateral groups such as diphenylaminostyryl and dicyanovinyl as electron donor (D) and acceptor (A), respectively. The influence of the asymmetric push–pull effect (as in D–π–A) on the optical as well as the electrochemical properties has been evaluated and compared with the symmetrical D–π–D and A–π–A systems. Theoretical investigation of the molecular properties using DFT/TD-DFT calculations was found to be in good agreement with the experimental results. The chromophore with an asymmetric push–pull architecture emerged as a better candidate for organic solar cell fabrication in terms of its optical band gap, HOMO–LUMO energy level, surface morphology, crystallinity, and charge carrier mobility. The photovoltaic performance of the synthesized chromophores in the bulk heterojunction solar cells revealed a power conversion efficiency of 2.01% for the asymmetric chromophore (D–π–A), which is better than the symmetrical counterparts (D–π–D and A–π–A). Overall, this work demonstrates the impact of symmetric and asymmetric push–pull switch within the fluoreno-thiophene π-molecular backbone on the modulation of the optoelectronic properties.
1. Introduction
Small molecule organic semiconductors have received considerable attention owing to their unique physical properties that make them promising candidates in functional organic device applications.1 Particularly, push–pull molecules in the recent years have emerged as a sub-class of π-conjugated organic semiconductors for various optoelectronic applications.2 Among the different forms of push–pull configurations,3 the simplest is the linear arrangement of electron donor (D) and acceptor (A) fragments end-capped on a π-conjugated spacer (π).4 Compared to the symmetric systems (D–π–D and A–π–A), the asymmetric push–pull arrangement (D–π–A) accounts for divergent optoelectronic properties because of the facile intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the HOMO of donor to the LUMO of acceptor.5 Also, because of their non-centrosymmetric nature, they tend to exhibit electric dipole moment whereas the centrosymmetric A–π–A and D–π–D molecules typically show electric quadrupole moment (Fig. 1).6 For instance, Misra's group has explored the influence of symmetrical and unsymmetrical push–pull effect on the optoelectronic properties of various twisted ICT chromophores.7 Attias et al. compared the non-linear optical properties of symmetric and asymmetric conjugated 3,3′-bipyridine chromophores.8 The impact of asymmetric effect on the panchromatic absorbance in organic dyes was disclosed by Evans et al.9 The combined chiroptical properties and computational analysis of the symmetrical as well as the non-symmetrical chromophores was reported by Sergeyev et al.10 Bäuerle's team established the effect of structure–property relationship of symmetrically and unsymmetrically substituted S,N-heteropentacenes on the optoelectronic and photovoltaic performance.11 In a similar way to these literature precedents, the aim of our investigation is to glean the molecular structure–physical property relationship between the linear push–pull chromophore of the type D–π–D, A–π–A (symmetric), and D–π–A (asymmetric). Due to the advantage of good optoelectronic properties coupled with their photovoltaic application, we used fluoreno-thiophene template as π-spacer12 in conjunction with diphenylaminostyryl and dicyanovinyl as D and A sub-units, respectively.

As part of our research interest on molecular chemistry for materials and biological applications,13 we herein disclose the synthesis and optoelectronic investigation of three new push–pull chromophores (TPA-TPA, CN-CN, and TPA-CN). To gain insight on the effect of D and A units on the optical and electrochemical properties, we carried out systematic variation on the π-spacer core by incorporating (i) two D groups (D–π–D, TPA-TPA), (ii) two A groups (A–π–A, CN-CN), and (iii) one D and one A group (D–π–A, TPA-CN). The effect of such substituent alterations on the optoelectronic properties was assessed by photophysical/electrochemical studies and correlated with theoretical calculations. Finally, organic photovoltaic devices were constructed for each of the aforementioned chromophores to understand the impact of the symmetric as well as the asymmetric push–pull transition on the cell performance and all the results are discussed in this paper.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Chemical synthesis and structural characterization
As depicted in Scheme 1, our chemical synthesis commenced with the diformylation of commercially available 2,7-bis(thien-2-yl)-9,9-dioctylfluorene under Vilsmeier–Haack conditions to obtain the common dialdehyde precursor CHO-CHO. In fact, this preparative method slightly differs from the one devised by Chen et al. as there is a reduction in the stoichiometry of POCl3 (2.0 eq.) and DMF (3.5 eq.) in order to improvise the yield of CHO-CHO (96%).12a The obtained CHO-CHO intermediate upon Knoevenagel condensation with 1.0 and 2.2 equivalents of malononitrile using basic alumina affords CN-CHO and CN-CN, respectively, in good yields. Likewise, CHO-CHO and CN-CHO were subjected to Wittig olefination with 2.2 and 1.1 equivalents of triphenylamine phosphonium ylide13a to form the desired TPA-TPA and TPA-CN, respectively. All the chromophores displayed excellent solubility in most of the commonly used organic solvents such as CH2Cl2, CHCl3, EtOAc, THF, and o-dichlorobenzene, which signifies their likely use in solution-processed organic solar cell fabrication. The chemical structure of all the chromophores was established by spectral data (FTIR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, DEPT-135, MS) and elemental analyses. In the FT-IR spectra, the newly formed CC bond in TPA-TPA, CN-CN, and TPA-CN was confirmed by a characteristic stretching peak at 1589, 1559, and 1574 cm−1, respectively. In addition, a distinct peak at 2217 and 2218 cm−1 corresponds to the nitrile functionality in CN-CN and TPA-CN, respectively. In the 1H NMR spectrum of TPA-TPA, a doublet at 6.82 ppm with a coupling constant (J) of 15.0 Hz suggests the presence of olefinic hydrogens in the trans-configuration. For the same compound, two peaks appeared at 119.7 and 120.1 ppm in the 13C NMR, which indicates the presence of two olefinic carbon atoms. In the case of CN-CN, the appearance of a sharp singlet in the 1H NMR spectrum at 7.75 ppm reveals the presence of two CH(CN)2 protons. In the 13C NMR spectrum, a peak at 156.9 ppm suggests the presence of olefinic carbon (CH) and two peaks at 113.4 and 114.2 ppm correspond to the presence of nitrile carbons. Moreover, DEPT-135 spectra of all the compounds were recorded to confirm the number of carbons in different environments such as primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary. The HRMS data of TPA-TPA, CN-CN, and TPA-CN exhibited a molecular ion [M+] peak corresponding to m/z = 1092.5445, 706.3157, and 899.4301 [M+], which unambiguously confirm the product formation.

2.2 Photophysical studies
The optical properties of all the chromophores were assessed by UV-visible electronic and photoluminescence spectra. Before commencing our studies on the optical properties, we expected that the condensation of the aldehyde moiety of CHO-CHO with different auxochromic groups could contribute to a batho-/hypsochromic shift. Hence, we initially recorded the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the intermediate CHO-CHO in chloroform and compared the optical properties with all the synthesized chromophores (Fig. S1, ESI†).14 As provided in Table 1, an absorption peak (λmax) of 394 nm attributed to the π–π* transition was observed with molar absorptivity (ε) of 70300 M−1 cm−1 (c = 2.0 × 10−5 M). The optical absorption edge (λedge) located at 438 nm corresponds to an optical band gap (Eoptg) of 2.83 eV. Having collected the optical data for CHO-CHO, we then assessed similar properties for the synthesized chromophores. The absorption wavelengths of all the new chromophores (TPA-TPA, CN-CN, and TPA-CN) described herein are in the indigo to blue region and exhibit bathochromic shift compared to their parent CHO-CHO molecule (Fig. 2a). For instance, TPA-TPA displayed λmax of 438 nm with fairly high molar absorptivity (ε = 202500 M−1 cm−1). Understandably, this increased ε even at a very low concentration (c = 5.0 × 10−6 M) is due to the extensive π-delocalization offered by the two electron rich triphenylamine groups. Because of the red shift, a reduced band gap of 2.52 eV (λedge = 490 nm) was observed for TPA-TPA. Incorporation of two electron withdrawing dicyanovinyl (CH(CN)2) group, as in CN-CN, that effects a substantial red shift (λmax = 466 nm) with significantly increased ε (78000 M−1 cm−1 at c = 1.0 × 10−5 M) compared to CHO-CHO was perceived along with a reduced band gap (λedge = 522 nm, Eoptg = 2.37 eV). As expected for the asymmetric push–pull spectral transition, TPA-CN displayed two broad absorptions at 421 and 478 nm distinctive of π–π* and ICT band, respectively. Indeed, the ICT band showed large ε (166800 M−1 cm−1 at c = 3.0 × 10−5 M) with stretched λedge of 560 nm (Eoptg = 2.21 eV), which indicates an operative asymmetric push–pull effect leading to absorption at lower wavelength. The absorption spectra of all the compounds as spun-cast thin films on quartz plates were also recorded to collect the information regarding their aggregation properties in solid state (Fig. 2b and Fig. S2, ESI†). Compared to the solution spectra, the absorption profile of the compounds presented herein showed tiny red shift in λmax and λedge, which is an indication of these compounds to undergo negligible J-aggregation in the solid state.15 As a consequence, a slight reduction in Eoptg (2.44 to 2.08 eV) was observed for all the chromophores, which in turn could be an added advantage in improving the short circuit current (Jsc) in organic solar cells via enhanced spectral overlap with the solar spectrum.16 Prompted by the intense colour of all the chromophores as depicted in Fig. 2c, we also evaluated the fluorescence emission (Fig. S3 and Table S1, ESI†). A bathochromic shift in the emission band (λem) ranging from 493 to 584 nm, with the highest being for TPA-CN, could be attributed to the facile formation of excited species via enhanced π–π interactions, thus leading to low energy emissions. The gradual red shift in the PL emission peaks moving from TPA-TPA to CN-CN to TPA-CN are consistent with the results obtained from the UV-Vis absorption spectra of these compounds. Additionally, the symmetric molecules TPA-TPA and CN-CN displayed a low energy shoulder peak at 523 and 553 nm, respectively, which could be explained either as an unresolved vibronic transition or the second π–π* transition. For the tested chromophores, a fairly intense blue to yellow fluorescence with significantly large Stokes shift was observed. This indicates the molecular flexibility of these π-conjugated systems, so that the excited molecules rapidly relax to the lower frequency vibrational modes of the excited state (S1) by dissipating the excess energy. In particular, the much reduced Stokes shift for TPA-CN (94350 cm−1) compared to TPA-TPA (178600 cm−1) and CN-CN (169500 cm−1) indicates a rigid and better planarity originating from the asymmetric push–pull effect. The relative emission quantum yield (ϕ) for all the compounds at different concentration and calibrated using standard quinine sulphate (55%)17 was found to be in between 21.1 and 14.2%. As depicted in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the photoluminescence excitation (PLE) of all the chromophores was found to be complementary to their photoluminescence spectrum with excitation wavelength (λex) ranging between 337 and 353 nm.

2.3 Theoretical investigation
In order to get an insight into the electronic structure as well as the excitation energies of all the chromophores, the energy minimized structures were analyzed using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G**(d,p) level basis set.18 The resultant ground state geometry of all the chromophores is depicted in Fig. 3. The selected carbon–carbon bond length between the various sub-units obtained from the gas phase structures was denoted as D1, D2, D3, and D4. The resultant bond length in the range of 1.42 to 1.46 Å favoured the ICT character of all the chromophores. Since, co-planarity of the π-conjugated backbone is one of the critical parameters for optoelectronic behaviour, the dihedral angle (θ) between the donor/acceptor and π-spacer as well as that between the thienyl and fluorenyl units was also calculated.19 The minimum energy conformations of all the structures exhibit θ between 154.15° and −179.80°, thus revealing the anti-coplanar conformation at these linkers.20 The dihedral angle θ2 and θ3 (S–C–C–C1) between the two planes of thienyl and fluorenyl linkers was found to be in between 154.15° and 156.88°. Comparatively, θ1 and θ4, the dihedral angles between C3-thienyl and donor/acceptor, gain significant co-planarity by ∼25° with the dihedral angle varying between −179.05° to −179.80°. Overall, the estimated geometric factors of these molecules imply significant planarity between the various π-linkers and guarantee effective electron delocalization, which in turn is vital to improve the optoelectronic properties.

The images of frontier π-molecular orbitals as predicted by DFT calculations are depicted in Fig. 4, left panel. In the case of TPA-TPA, the HOMO is delocalized over the electron rich triphenylamine, thienyl, and fluorenyl portions, whilst the LUMO is concentrated more on the thienyl and fluorenyl units. In the chromophore CN-CN, the HOMO is contributed mostly by the electron rich aromatic units such as thienyl and fluorenyl. As anticipated, the LUMO is mainly distributed on the dicyanovinyl (CH(CN)2) group and the thienyl backbone. Finally, the HOMO of TPA-CN displays the typical topography of an asymmetric push–pull transition with electron delocalization predominantly at the donor part (triphenylamine) and conjugated spacer (thienyl group). The LUMO is localized on the acceptor part (dicyanovinyl) and conjugated spacer (thienyl group). The orbital energy obtained from DFT calculations (Fig. 4, right panel) reveals that among the three push–pull systems, CN-CN exhibits a deep HOMO (−5.99 eV) and LUMO (−3.19 eV) energy level. Indeed, this deep location of the HOMO–LUMO is attributed to the presence of two strong electron accepting CH(CN)2 groups, which result in the greater stabilization of the LUMO energy level. As expected for TPA-TPA, the HOMO (−4.62 eV) and LUMO (−1.85 eV) energy levels are significantly higher due to the electron-rich nature of the whole molecule. For an asymmetric D–π–A system such as TPA-CN, the HOMO–LUMO (−4.83 eV, −2.86 eV) energies were found to be in between those of the symmetric TPA-TPA and CN-CN. These observations signify the crucial role played by the symmetric and asymmetric push–pull transition in fine-tuning the HOMO–LUMO energy gap.

Information pertaining to the oscillator strength (f) and major electronic transitions along with the composition and light harvesting efficiency (LHE) were computed by TD-DFT studies. As disclosed in Table 2, TPA-TPA exhibits a single absorption band due to the π–π* electronic transition at λmax = 508 nm with a preferential contribution of 95% from the HOMO → LUMO transition. Similar to TPA-TPA, a single absorption peak (λmax) attributed to the π–π* transition at 487 nm was observed for CN-CN with 100% contribution of the HOMO → LUMO transition. For TPA-CN, because of the incorporation of an asymmetric push–pull switch, an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) band appears at the longer wavelength region (689 nm). This electronic redistribution corresponds to the HOMO → LUMO (99%) transition from the electron rich triphenylamine to electron deficient dicyanovinyl group. In all instances, the theoretical absorption wavelengths were found to be slightly higher than that of the experimental results. Nevertheless, the spectral pattern for all the chromophores was retained in good agreement with the same trend (Fig. S4, ESI†). It is also possible for the neighbouring orbitals to exhibit quasi-degenerate energy levels in the boundary region, which would lead to inaccurate description of the frontier orbitals. Therefore, the total density of states (TDOS) has been schemed in Fig. S4 (ESI†) using GaussSum, which illustrates the composition of the molecular orbitals and their contribution to chemical bonding.21 To compute the contributions of different structural variants to the frontier orbitals, we have compared the partial density of states (PDOS) with TDOS (Fig. 5). We represent the diphenylaminostyryl, fluorenothiophene, and dicyanovinyl moieties as TPA, spacer, and CN, respectively. The PDOS indicates that the composition of the TPA-TPA bands is dominated almost equally by TPA (47%) and the spacer (53%). In the case of CN-CN, the primary contributions are from the spacer (81%) and marginal contributions are from CN (19%). In TPA-CN, the major contributions are specifically from TPA (62%) and spacer (38%).

To compare the information relevant to molecular structure, chemical reactivity and stability, it becomes essential to calculate the global chemical reactivity descriptors (GCRD).22 Hence, quantum chemical parameters such as chemical potential (μ), chemical hardness (η), chemical softness (σ), electronegativity (χ), and dipole moment (ρ) were calculated with the help of molecular orbitals (Table 3).23 On the basis of μ values, it was found that the electron escaping tendency of the chromophores follows the order: TPA-TPA (−3.23 eV) > TPA-CN (−3.84 eV) > CN-CN (−4.59 eV). Nonetheless, the calculated μ values are quite higher than that of phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), a standard n-type material used in organic solar cell (μ = −4.92 eV).24 Hence, our chromophores could serve as donors by using PCBM as the acceptor in p/n heterojunction solar cells. The molecular stability in terms of its hardness (η) follow the order CN-CN (1.40 eV) > TPA-TPA (1.38 eV) > TPA-CN (0.98 eV). Because of the higher η values, CN-CN and TPA-TPA are relatively hard and stable, while TPA-CN is expected to be soft and reactive. In fact, the higher softness for TPA-CN (σ = 1.02 eV−1) further suggested the ease of electron redistribution during covalent bonding. Quite logically, the magnitude of electronegativity (χ) increases with every increase in the number of electron withdrawing nitrile group. Hence, the order of χ follows CN-CN (4.59 eV) > TPA-CN (3.84 eV) > TPA-TPA (3.23 eV). To our expectation, the computed molecular dipole moment (ρ) for TPA-CN was found to be high (11.65 D), thus indicating a strong intermolecular interaction in the unsymmetrical donor–acceptor configuration. On the other hand, the symmetrical TPA-TPA shows a very less ρ of 1.25 D. Despite being symmetric, the high ρ value of 10.65 D for CN-CN is probably due to the break in structural symmetry as observed with some of the quadrupolar and octupolar molecules.25 The understanding of the molecular shape, size, and charge of the electrostatic potential regions were obtained from the molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) map, as shown in Fig. 6. The blue and red coloured surfaces of the molecules are the preferred regions for nucleophilic and electrophilic attack, respectively. For CN-CN and TPA-CN, the red partitions are mainly concentrated on the electron deficient cyano group. For TPA-TPA, which is completely devoid of the cyano group, the largest negative (red) partitions are relatively concentrated on the fluoreno-thienyl spacer. As per these observations, the molecular interactions at these sites are favoured.

At this point of our investigation, we also included the solvent effects from chloroform using the integral equation formalism variant of the polarizable continuum model (IEFPCM). The TD-DFT calculations were carried out on the respective ground state structures using Coulomb-attenuating method (CAM) to sort out the inaccuracy of the non-Coulomb part of the exchange functionals at large distance (Fig. S5, ESI†). The observed λmax for TPA-TPA, CN-CN, and TPA-CN was found to be 522, 406, and 408 nm, respectively. Nevertheless, these values were found to be deviated from the experimental results. The calculated HOMO–LUMO energies were found to be −4.72/−1.97 eV (TPA-TPA), −6.99/−1.88 eV (CN-CN), and −6.05/−1.74 eV (TPA-CN), which slightly diverge from the corresponding electrochemical HOMO–LUMO levels. Hence, the calculated UV-Vis data and HOMO–LUMO gap from IEFPCM is somewhat underestimated and only the gas phase calculations have good correlation with the solid-state absorption spectra.
2.4 Redox properties
To evaluate the redox properties and orbital energy levels of the synthesized chromophores, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed in chloroform (2.0 × 10−3 M) by utilizing nBu4NPF6 (0.1 M) as the supporting electrolyte at room temperature (Fig. 7). Platinum foil, glassy carbon, and silver wire were used as the counter, working, and reference electrodes, respectively. A standard ferrocenium/ferrocene redox couple (Fc+/Fc) showing a half wave potential (E1/2) of 0.49 V vs. Ag wire was used for calibration. At the outset, analysis of the CV results indicates that the anodic potential (Eox) of all the compounds is irreversible. This observation suggests that the in situ formation of radical-cationic species is either unstable or the species might engage in subsequent complex reactions spurred by electron transfer. A quick glance at the CV data confirmed that the Eox value downshifts progressively with every increase in the number of triphenylamine moiety (TPA-TPAvs.TPA-CN). This can understandably be attributed to the easy oxidation of the systems containing a greater number of electron-rich triphenylamine groups (Table 4).26 For instance, TPA-TPA showed Eox and Ered at 0.65 and −0.92 V, respectively, whereas the redox potential was found to be at 0.68 and −0.82 V, respectively, for TPA-CN. In contrast, CN-CN displayed two oxidation waves (Eox) at 1.45 and 1.67 V, and one reduction wave (Ered) at −0.78 V. For CN-CN, the first oxidation potential is shifted more positively compared to other chromophores, which could be attributed to the deep location of the HOMO brought by the strong electron withdrawing effect of the two CH(CN)2 groups. It is also to be remembered that when the potential window was slightly extended, a second oxidation occurs immediately, which allows no reversibility of the redox process. Since, only the onset of the oxidation potential is required to calculate the HOMO, the first oxidation potential was immediately reversed. By applying the Pommerehne empirical relation,27 the frontier molecular orbital energies (EHOMO and ELUMO) were calculated from the respective Eox and Ered onset values. To this end, the HOMO/LUMO energies for TPA-TPA, CN-CN, and TPA-CN were estimated to be −4.96/−3.39 eV, −5.76/−3.53 eV, and −4.99/−3.48 eV, respectively. Although, the electrochemical energy level correlates with the theoretical calculations in merely a reasonable capacity (vide supra), the observed trend was found to be in good agreement. Likewise, the electrochemical band gap for CN-CN (ECVg = 2.23 eV) correlates well with its optical band gap (Eoptg = 2.37 eV). For TPA-TPA and TPA-CN, the ECVg (1.57 and 1.51 eV) is lesser compared to their Eoptg (2.52 and 2.21 eV). This discrepancy is probably attributed to the presence of poor electron carriers such as the triphenylamine group, hence, the value of the obtained reduction potential may not be reliable. Nonetheless, the orbital energies derived from the computational and electrochemical studies for asymmetric push–pull TPA-CN was found to be in between those of the symmetric TPA-TPA and CN-CN, as expected.

2.5 Thermal characteristics
Thermal stability as assessed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 specified different degradation modes for these compounds (Fig. 8 and Fig. S6, ESI†). The decomposition temperature (Td) corresponding to 5% weight loss for TPA-TPA, CN-CN, and TPA-CN was found to be 228, 197, and 217 °C, respectively. Moreover, six step degradations were detected for TPA-TPA (between 184 and 713 °C) and five steps of degradation were observed for CN-CN (between 212 and 670 °C). On the other hand, TPA-CN displayed four marked steps of degradation (between 298 and 599 °C) with a higher amount of residual mass (19.91%). The higher thermal stability shown by TPA-CN could probably be due to the tight molecular packing than other compounds. Nevertheless, all the compounds showed sufficient thermal stability by retaining a significant amount of mass at their first decomposition temperature (TPA-TPA = 98%; CN-CN = 93%; TPA-CN = 91%). Indeed, this reduced weight loss after thermal heating is beneficial during the chemical vapour deposition in solution processed solar cell fabrication. DSC thermograms of all the chromophores were found to have smooth flexion endotherms with a shape typical of a glass-transition (Tg). The Tg for CN-CN and TPA-CN was lower than 250 °C whereas for TPA-TPA it was around 300 °C, which indicates different structural changes under the thermal conditions (Fig. S7, ESI†).

2.6 Photovoltaic results
The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cell active layer fabricated in our study comprises of a blend of one of the chromophores, viz., TPA-TPA, CN-CN, or TPA-CN as the donor material and PCBM as the acceptor material. After few initial trials using various donor–acceptor ratios, we arrived at an optimum D:A blend ratio of 1:1 (wt/wt). Accordingly, the prepared thin films of the active layer were spin-coated on ITO plates using o-dichlorobenzene as the solvent and subjected to vacuum annealing at 120 °C for 5 min. An inverted device with a cell configuration of ITO/ZnO/BHJ/V2O5/Ag was fabricated. Cell performance in terms of power conversion efficiency (η) of the constructed devices was assessed by simulated solar illumination under AM 1.5 conditions at 100 mW cm−2. The average efficiency of each π-semiconductor in a batch of six identical devices is shown in Fig. 9. As depicted in Table 5, analysis of the results clearly revealed that all cells showed similar open circuit voltage (Voc = 0.52 to 0.58 V) and fill factor (FF = 0.51 to 0.55). However, significant improvement in the short circuit current density (Jsc) was perceived in the increasing order of TPA-TPA (3.7 mA cm−2), CN-CN (4.8 mA cm−2), and TPA-CN (6.8 mA cm−2). This trend directly correlates with the extended absorption wavelength moving from TPA-TPA to CN-CN to TPA-CN by facilitating an effective spectral overlap with the solar spectrum to enhance the Jsc. Indeed, this noteworthy variation considerably influences the overall efficiency of the cell, with the highest being 2.01% for TPA-CN (Jsc = 6.8 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.58 V, FF = 0.51). Whereas, a moderate efficiency of 1.47 and 1.01% was obtained for CN-CN (Jsc = 4.8 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.56 V, FF = 0.56) and TPA-TPA (Jsc = 3.7 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.52 V, FF = 0.53), respectively. This could probably be attributed to the relative position of the HOMO–LUMO energy levels of TPA-CN (−4.83/−2.86 eV) to ensure effectual charge separation at the D/A interface.28 The hole mobility (μh) of all the molecular semiconductors was determined from the J–V characteristics in dark by space-charge limited current (SCLC) method on hole-only device in the cell configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/chromophore:PCBM/Au. As shown in Table 5, both the symmetrical chromophores show poor mobility with μh = 1.1 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 8.6 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for TPA-TPA and CN-CN, respectively. However, the unsymmetrical chromophore TPA-CN displayed the highest mobility with μh = 1.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and correlates well with the highest Jsc value.

2.7 Surface morphology and crystallinity
It is noteworthy to mention that the cell performance got increased only after solvent vacuum annealing (SVA) treatment. To assess the role of SVA, the performance of pristine and SVA treated cells were compared for the blend TPA-CN:PCBM. As shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), an efficiency of only 0.66% was obtained for the as-cast blend, whereas annealing resulted in an improvement to 2.01%. Therefore, to glean information regarding the surface morphology before and after annealing, atomic force microscopy (AFM) on the pristine and SVA treated BHJ blend films was performed (Fig. 10a and b). The 3D-topographical and phase images revealed that the root mean square roughness (σRMS) of 2.77 nm for the as-cast blend reduced to 2.39 nm after annealing. Despite this slight reduction in the roughness, the thermally annealed films attained continuity compared to the as-cast blend, indicating a good inter-penetration network at the p/n heterojunction. This better-quality interface is likely to facilitate the exciton dissociation and to improve the efficiency of the device.29 Although, a substantial decrease in roughness was evidenced in annealed the TPA-TPA (σRMS = 4.8 nm) in comparison to the as-cast sample (σRMS = 10.1 nm), the thickness seems to be uneven (Fig. S9, ESI†). In the case of CN-CN, no noteworthy change in the coarsening was observed before and after annealing (σRMS = 9.1 nm). Instead, uneven accumulation of the heterojunction morphology was witnessed (Fig. S10, ESI†). The overall findings from the AFM analysis revealed that the annealing effect is more influential in TPA-CN than the other chromophores in enhancing the efficiency of the cell. This interpretation is also supported by thin film X-ray diffraction analysis (Fig. S10, ESI†), in which the thermally annealed films for TPA-TPA and TPA-CN showed more intense peaks compared to the pristine sample. This is indicative that annealing enhances the crystallization degree and phase purity. In the case of CN-CN, no significant change before and after annealing was observed.

3. Conclusions
In summary, three new chromophores (TPA-TPA, CN-CN, and TPA-CN) were constructed on the fluoreno-thiophene backbone. These chromophores were differentiated by varying the lateral groups such as diphenylaminostyryl and dicyanovinyl to form one asymmetric (TPA-CN) and two symmetric (TPA-TPA, CN-CN) structures. The influence of this structural variance on the physical properties was assessed by photo-absorption studies and correlated with theoretical investigation. These results revealed a reduced band gap for the dipolar chromophore TPA-CN compared to its quadrupolar counterparts. As far as the relative position of the frontier orbitals is concerned, both cyclic voltammetry and DFT calculations exposed a deep HOMO–LUMO location for CN-CN. TGA analysis showed a remarkable thermal stability for TPA-CN compared to the other compounds. The photovoltaic performance in the prototype devices revealed a power conversion efficiency of 2.01% for TPA-CN, which is better than the symmetric TPA-TPA (1.07%) and CN-CN (1.47%). The better efficiency for TPA-CN was supported by its smooth film forming ability and crystallinity, as confirmed by AFM and XRD respectively. On a whole, the present work unravels the impact of symmetric and asymmetric push–pull effect in modulating the molecular properties of π-conjugated semiconductors, which in turn is essential for the desired optoelectronic applications.

4.7 Experimental procedure for organic solar cell fabrication
An inverted device with a configuration of ITO/ZnO/BHJ/V2O5/Ag was constructed. A series of indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes in an area of 1.5 × 1.5 cm were readied and etched with Zn powder and 0.1 M HCl in a specified area of 0.5 × 1.5 cm. Subsequent cleaning with demineralized water under sonication, acetone, and isopropanol was finally followed by UV-ozone treatment. On the surface of the resulting ITO substrate, ZnO layer was deposited by spin-coating for 1 min at 3000 rpm. A bulk heterojunction (BHJ) layer was prepared from a 1:1 blend of the given chromophore (5 mg) and PCBM (5 mg) in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (1 mL) under stirring for 5 h. The obtained solution was spin-coated on the ZnO surface for 1 min at 1000 rpm and dried in air for 30 min. Afterwards, V2O5 at a thickness of ∼5–7 nm at 0.1 Å s−1 and silver at a thickness of ∼140–160 nm at 10 Å s−1, respectively, were coated over the BHJ surface by chemical vapour deposition (CVD). The as-prepared cells were encapsulated in air and the photocurrent of the fabricated devices was measured with a sweeping voltage using a source measurement unit controlled by a computer under simulated solar light (AM 1.5G; 100 mW cm−2) illumination. The incident light intensity was calibrated to 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) with a standard silicon photodiode. The current vs. voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured for an area (0.2 × 0.5 cm) of 0.1 cm2.
