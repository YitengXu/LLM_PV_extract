    , Accepted 7th March 2019First published on 9th March 2019AbstractHybrid nanostructures comprising conjugated polymers (CPs) and plasmonic metals show excellent performance in light harvesting. However, the energy transfer mechanism of the CP film to nearby metal nanoparticles, especially knowledge of the characteristic distance, is still unclear. Here, quenching of the emission of a CP film in proximity to a monolayer of graphene-nanodot-supported silver nanoparticles (GND-Ag NPs) is investigated. Uniform Ag NPs with D = 3.2 nm were grown on GNDs in situ under mild light irradiation, and a series of bilayer structures of GND-Ag NPs/CPs were constructed by spin-coating blue, green and red light-emitting poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene) (PFO), poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-alt-benzothiadiazole) (F8BT) and poly[2-methoxy-5-(2′-ethylhexyloxy)-p-phenylene vinylene] (MEH-PPV),respectively, on top of the GND-Ag NP plane. The spacer distance was controlled by the layers of assembled polyelectrolytes. Both steady and transient photoluminescence (PL) spectra showed emission quenching of the bilayer structures, providing the maximum efficiency of 99% for the F8BT films. The surface density of GND-Ag NPs and the spacer distance-dependent PL quenching data were analyzed within the plasmonic resonant energy transfer model, and the extracted characteristic distances are 6 nm, 3 nm and 10 nm for the PFO, F8BT and MEH-PPV systems, respectively. Current-sensing atomic force microscopy shows that the GND-Ag NPs/F8BT film exhibits enhanced electrical conductivity. These results are believed to be important for the development of plasmonic enhanced polymer photovoltaics and photocatalysis.
Introduction
Conjugated polymers (CPs) are growing in popularity for the design of nanoscale-based light-harvesting systems1–3 due to their favorable electronic properties, high photoabsorption coefficients and tunable emission spectra, which can be made to overlap with the absorption spectra of a large variety of energy acceptors. Various CP-based light-harvesting systems, such as CP/fullerene4 and CP/semiconductor5 hybrids, have been developed for energy conversion applications by taking advantage of the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between CP and fullerene or the semiconductors.2 As alternatives, many CP/metal nanostructures have been prepared for spontaneous emission enhancement,6,7 organic photovoltaics (OPV),8–12 photocatalysis,13 nanosensors14 and nanoantennas.15,16 Effective plasmon–exciton interactions are essential for those applications, where CP excitons couple with the surface plasmons of metals, promoting energy transfer or charge transfer.17,18
Surface plasmons are collective free electron oscillations in a noble metal (Au, Ag, Pt, etc.) nanoparticle (NP) at an interface with a dielectric material which can be excited by incident light at the resonance wavelength and wavevector and provide strong and confined electromagnetic fields to the nearby emitter.19 The plasmon–emitter coupling is frequently expected to lead to significant emission quenching through effective nonradiative energy transfer;20,21 this has been called nanometal surface energy transfer22,23 or plasmonic resonant energy transfer (PRET).24–26 Compared with dipole–dipole coupling-based FRET, PRET shows a very different distance trend27–30 and magnitude of interaction.31 Analysis has confirmed that the PRET process is capable of occurring at longer distances than the typical Förster distances because it is d−4 distance-dependent rather than d−6 distance-dependent, as in the FRET mechanism.26,27 On the other hand, emitter–plasmon coupling is most effective for small metal NPs, especially sub-10 nm plasmonic nanostructures. This feature offers a great opportunity to create high energy transfer rate systems that are far superior to those with several tens of nanometer-sized particles (30 to 100 nm).32–35 A growing number of researchers claim that the current density and power conversion efficiency of OPV devices can be effectively enhanced by incorporating sub-10 nm plasmonic NPs.36–39 Choi et al. prepared 3 nm Ag NPs using carbon dots (CDs) as templates; they realized a 10.3% enhancement of the OPV efficiency.10 Chen et al. demonstrated that a polymer fiber containing 5 nm Ag NPs could enhance the exciton generation of active materials through the plasmonic effect.40,41 Yao et al. confirmed that 3 nm-sized Ag–Au NPs contribute a 43.3% efficiency improvement by placing them in the hole-transport layer.42 Lim incorporated 5 nm-sized Au38 cores in inverted solar cells and thus produced a 20% increase in the efficiency.43 Mostly, the working principles have been addressed in terms of the combined effects of plasmon decay, scattering, near-field enhancement, and plasmonic energy transfer, including direct hot electron transfer44 and resonant energy transfer.26 However, the location of the plasmonic metal in these devices (e.g. in the hole transport layer) often places them too far away to effectively couple with the active material, finally leading to very low energy transfer efficiency. Thus, the rapid pace of publication has been accompanied by a host of critical issues and controversies associated with these emerging materials.45–47 A primary obstacle to progress is the inadequacy of estimation of the effective distance in plasmon-enhanced devices; this omission gives rise to misunderstandings about the distance-dependent nature and characteristics of PRET. In this work, we first synthesized 3.2 nm-sized Ag NPs using graphene nanodots (GNDs) as a template; then, we fabricated a series of GND-Ag NPs/CPs bilayer structures containing blue, green or red light-emitting PFO, F8BT or MEH-PPV (Fig. 1). In principle, for a CP molecule in proximity to a single GND-Ag NP, three possible channels of energy relaxation should be considered: direct emission into free-space, intrinsic non-radiative damping, and nonradiative energy transfer to a nearby metal. To determine the characteristic distance for energy transfer, the GND-Ag NP surface density and distance-dependences of the emission quenching were characterized using both steady and transient PL spectra, where the spacer thickness was controlled by the layers of assembled polyelectrolytes (poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride)/poly(styrenesulfonate))n ((PDDA/PSS)n) (Scheme 1).

Experimental section
Reagents
F8BT (MW ≤ 25000), PFO (MW ≥ 20000) and MEH-PPV (MW = 70000 to 100000) were purchased from Nanjing Organic Nano Electronics Inc. Silver nitrate (AgNO3), PDDA (MW = 100000 to 200000) and PSS (MW = 70000) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The other reagents and solvents were analytical-grade.
Preparation of GND-Ag NPs
GNDs were synthesized according to the literature using carbon fiber (CF) or graphene oxide (GO) as the carbon source.48,49 To load them with Ag NPs, 9 mL of GNDs aqueous solution (0.1 mg mL−1) and 3 mL of AgNO3 solution (1 mg mL−1) were mixed in a quartz tube. Under nitrogen protection, the mixture was irradiated by a 254 nm ultraviolet lamp (8 W) for 130 min. The solution color deepened with time and finally became brown.
Bilayer structure fabrication
350 μL of colloidal GND-Ag NPs were deposited first on a clean quartz slide (2.5 cm in diameter), where the concentration of the casting solution was varied between 0.02 and 0.4 mg mL−1 to achieve different GND-Ag NP surface densities. After a day of drying, a solution of CP in toluene was spun on top of the GND-Ag NP layer at 2000 rpm for 60 s. Then, the substrate was placed in a dryer overnight and further annealed at 120 °C for 80 min. The spacer distance between the GND-Ag NPs and the CP layer was controlled by a layer-by-layer assembly of positively charged PDDA and negatively charged PSS from solutions with concentrations of 0.02 mol L−1. Thus, the bilayer structures were composed of three main blocks: the monolayer of Ag NPs, followed by the spacer layer of (PDDA/PSS)n/PDDA, where the notation of (PDDA/PSS)n represents the n-bilayers of PDDA and PSS, and the spun thin film of CPs, represented as GND-Ag NPs/[(PDDA/PSS)n/PDDA]/CPs.
Characterization
High resolution microscopy measurements were performed using a JEM-1200EX transmission electron microscope (TEM) with an operating voltage of 120 kV. AFM images (Dimension Icon, Bruker Instruments Inc.) were acquired in tapping mode with samples deposited in air on freshly cleaved mica surfaces. Raman spectra were obtained using a Renishaw RW1000 (Renishaw, Wotton-under-Edge, UK) confocal microscope with a 514 nm argon-ion laser as the exciting light. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) characterization was carried out on a Bruker Vertex 70 FTIR spectrometer. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded with a Hitachi U4100 spectrometer. The PL spectra were recorded by a Hitachi F-7000 spectrophotometer equipped with a 450 W xenon lamp as a light source. The slit widths of the emission and excitation were both 5.0 nm, and the PMT voltage was 700 V. The absolute quantum yields (QYs) of all samples were measured via integrating spheres. The time-resolved PL spectra were performed with an F980 spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments, UK), equipped with a single photon photomultiplier detector (S900-R). The pulse width, wavelength, and repetition rate of the laser light source were chosen as 70.2 ps, 373.6 nm, and 10 MHz, respectively. Stop condition: time = 120 s. The beam spot sizes for steady and transient measurements were 1 mm × 1 cm and 1 mm2, respectively, and sample regions with uniform slide coverage were measured to ensure the repeatability of the total PL measurements. The ITO/GND-Ag/F8BT electrode was prepared by assembling the composites onto ITO glass. Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed on a CHI 760D electrochemical workstation (Shanghai) with a three-electrode configuration using Hg/HgCl2 (SCE) in sat. KCl as the reference electrode, Pt wire as the counter electrode and the prepared film with an active area ca. 0.12 cm2 as the working electrode. Conductive AFM measurements were conducted in ambient air using a contact mode current-sensing atomic force microscope (model PicoSPM, Molecular Imaging) equipped with a Nanosensor platinum-coated cantilever (with a 0.12 N m−1 spring constant). The microscope was set to measure currents up to 1.0 μA by the manufacturer. The load force was maintained below 10 nN to avoid damage to the cantilever tip and the polymer film. In these measurements, the bias voltage between the substrate (ITO electrode) and the conducting platinum (Pt) cantilever (which was grounded) was scanned in forward or backward mode to obtain the conductive AFM images.
Results and discussion
Structure of the GND-Ag NPs
GNDs were prepared using an acidic oxidation method by cutting graphene-based starting materials (including GO and carbon fiber) into nanosized fragments.48,49 Using the GNDs both as a template and a reducing agent, we irradiated the AgNO3 precursor with a mild ultraviolet lamp to obtain uniform sub-10 nm Ag NPs. Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) spectra were used to monitor the growth process of the nanoparticles, and various effects on the final NPs were considered, including the AgNO3 concentration and irradiation time (Fig. S1†). The obtained GND-Ag NPs were directly observed by TEM (Fig. 1a). It was found that the Ag NPs grew homogeneously on the GNDs, with each dot loading only a single NP due to the GND template confinement (∼5 nm for the GND size) (Fig. 1b). We also noted that there were many differences in the size and distribution of the loaded Ag NPs when different GND templates were used. The GO-based GNDs could load much smaller and more uniform Ag NPs than the carbon fiber-based GNDs (Fig. 1c and Fig. S2a†), as can be further confirmed by the narrower LSPR peak of the former (Fig. S2b†). Statistical analysis shows that the size of the Ag NPs supported by GO-based GNDs is 3.2 ± 0.8 nm, and the fringe spacing is 0.25 nm (Fig. 1d). The AFM average height of the GND-Ag NPs is 9.0 ± 2.4 nm, which nearly equals the sum of the diameter of the Ag NPs (3.2 ± 0.8 nm) and the height of the GNDs (4.4 ± 1.5 nm) (Fig. 1e). The AFM results also show that the GND-Ag NPs are uniformly dispersed on the quartz substrate without any aggregation, suggesting that the nanoparticles are able to form a homogeneous monolayer on quartz substrate. With increasing casting concentration of GND-Ag NP solution, the surface coverage of the as-deposited nanoparticle monolayer on quartz grew gradually (Fig. S3†), and the surface density (Γ, particles per nm2) was easily calculated by the measured mass concentration (γi, μg mL−1) of the casting solution, Γ = 8.893 × 1010γi (ESI†).
The interaction between the GNDs and the loaded Ag NPs is also interesting and worthy of examination. GNDs have been characterized as confined graphene fragments bound to rich oxygen-containing groups such as hydroxyl, carboxyl and epoxy. These features can be observed by FTIR, Raman and fluorescence spectra. By analyzing the changes in these signals for the GNDs before and after loading with Ag NPs, we can understand the interactions between them. As shown in Fig. 1f, the FTIR spectral signals show significant enhancement and shifting after Ag loading, e.g., the in-plane C–H bending vibration at 1432 cm−1 and C–O stretching vibration at 1128 cm−1 for GNDs strengthened greatly and redshifted to 1383 cm−1 and 1109 cm−1, respectively. Both the Raman D (1363 cm−1) and G (1589 cm−1) signals show dramatic enhancement due to the SERS effect (Fig. 1g).50 Also, the fluorescence of the GNDs shows stepwise quenching with increasing Ag loading, which can be explained by the nonradiative energy transfer of GNDs to the loaded Ag NPs (Fig. S4†).
PL quenching of CPs
To enable adaptation of the results to a wide range of polymer semiconductors, three typical light-emitting CPs were used, namely blue emissive PFO, green F8BT and red MEH-PPV. The thicknesses, PL emission peaks (λem) and QYs of the spin-coating films are given in Table 1. Reference CP films were prepared by spin-coating the polymer solution directly on a quartz substrate. The emission of the blue emitting PFO is close to the resonance of the LSPR peak of the GND-Ag NP layer, while both F8BT and MEH-PPV are red-shifted. Due to their lower molecular weights compared with MEH-PPV, the thin films of both PFO and F8BT feature discontinuity and even a number of bumps (Fig. S5†). By virtue of the small sizes of GND-Ag NPs with homogenous surface densities, the morphologies of the CP films changed little after they were deposited on the plasmonic substrates.

Through interaction with the LSPR, the PL spectra of the CP film on the GND-Ag NP substrate show strong emission quenching from the controlled film. Both steady-state and transient-state PL spectral methods were used to characterize the quenching process. The PL emission spectra of the bilayer structures at different GND-Ag NP surface densities, Γ, are shown in Fig. 2a–c and Fig. S6,† where Γ varies from approximately 0.2 × 10−2 nm−2 to 4.4 × 10−2 nm−2. With increasing GND-Ag NP surface coverage, the integrated fluorescence band intensity decreases sharply. When Γ is fixed at about 0.02 nm−2, the fluorescence intensities of PFO, F8BT and MEH-PPV show quenching 84%, 89% and 86% that of the pure polymer, respectively. This quenching phenomenon mainly results from the increase in the surface plasmon absorption of the GND-Ag NP monolayer, which is associated with increasing nanoparticle density. To investigate the quenching of fluorescence in more detail, we acquired time-resolved PL spectra (Fig. S7†). As can be seen, the decay curves for the CPs coupled to the GND-Ag NP layer differ significantly from those of the uncoupled CPs. The weakest PL signal stems from a bilayer structure with the highest GND-Ag NP surface coverage. To quantify the luminescence quenching efficiency from the time-resolved data, the PL decay curves for the samples with different GND-Ag NP surface coverages were normalized and the areas under the curves were determined, representing the time-integrated emission (Fig. 2d–f). In these cases, the PL of PFO, F8BT and MEH-PPV was suppressed by 84%, 99% and 65%, respectively. The average lifetimes were determined from biexponential fits of the time-resolved PL traces using a Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm to minimize the residuals about the form: , where y0 is a linear offset and Ai is the amplitude of the component at t = 0; τi is the lifetime, where 1/τi is the rate of decay (γT). The CP film thickness dependence of the PL lifetime was also taken into account (Fig. S8 and Table S1†). It was found that increased film thickness results in decreased PL lifetime and increased PL intensity; however, the slight variation in lifetime had no real influence on the transient PL quenching caused by the GND-Ag NPs. In line with the steady PL quenching, the lifetime of each CP clearly decreases with increasing surface density of the GND-Ag NP layer; that is, the LSPR-CP emission coupling leads to acceleration of the decay rates. On the GND-Ag NP substrate, the PL lifetimes of the PFO, F8BT and MEH-PPV films decreased from the original 0.58 ns (λem = 450 nm), 1.03 ns (λem = 530 nm) and 1.45 ns (λem = 550 nm) to 0.46 ns, 0.37 ns and 1.22 ns, respectively. The decreased lifetime indicates an accelerated decay rate of the CP molecules. In the case of zero-distance contact of GND-Ag NPs and CPs, the large PL quenching of the three CPs is mainly due to two effects of equal importance: first, the GND-Ag NPs increase the nonradiative rate γnrd of the CPs due to energy transfer, and second, the radiative rate γrad of the CPs is decreased because the molecular dipole and the dipole induced on the Ag NPs radiate out of phase if the molecules are oriented tangentially to the GND-Ag NP surface. Here, we neglect charge carrier transfer as an additional route of fluorescence quenching, and we further separate the radiative decay rate γrad and the nonradiative rate γnrd of the CPs from the total rate. The former can be deduced from the count rate Ifluo (t = 0) immediately after the excitation of the samples: γrad = γ0rad·Ifluo (t = 0)/I0fluo (t = 0)(1)where I0fluo (t = 0) is the count rate and γ0rad is the radiative rate of the uncoupled CP film. We can also determine γnrd from these two quantities by subtracting γrad from γT, while γnrd is the sum of the intrinsic nonradiative rate γnrd,0 and the energy transfer rate γET. We observe that when Γ increases from 0 to 1.6 × 10−2 nm−2, γrad of the PFO film decreases monotonically from 0.7 × 109 s−1 (intrinsic value γrad,0) to 0.09 × 109 s−1, while γnrd increases from 1.0 × 109 (intrinsic value γnrd,0) to 2.2 × 109 s−1. For the F8BT and MEH-PPV-based systems, similar results of decreased γrad accompanied with increased γnrd were obtained.

Development of the PRET model
Because γrad ≪ γnrd in all cases, we suggest that the decreased quantum efficiency is more related to resonant energy transfer from the CP molecules to the GND-Ag NPs than to a changing radiative rate for this system. Different formalisms to describe nonradiative energy transfer for a single metal–emitter pair have been established elsewhere; here, we will present details relevant to the energy transfer from the CP film to a plane of GND-Ag NPs. The Persson model51 states that the damping rate to the surface of a noble metal can be calculated by (2)where μ is the matrix element of the dipole moment operator, ℏ is the reduced Planck constant, ωCP is the CP molecule emission frequency, ωF = 1.6 × 1016 rad s−1 and kF = 1.2 × 108 cm−1 are the bulk silver angular frequency and Fermi wavevector, respectively, and r is the separation from the center of the CP molecule to the center of each Ag NP.52 This can be further expressed in more measurable parameters through the use of the Einstein A21 coefficient:23 (3)to give the following rate of energy transfer, in accordance with Coulomb's law (1/4πε0, ε0 is the bulk dielectric function): (4)where c is the speed of light and QY and τCP are the PL quantum yield and lifetime of the CP molecule, respectively. The d0 value is a convenient value to calculate for a CP–metal pair, yielding the characteristic distance at which a CP molecule will display equal probabilities of energy transfer and spontaneous emission. Then, the d0 value can be written as: (5)where n is the refractive index of the medium.
In the case of the bilayer structure, with each GND-Ag NP/CP system treated within the PRET formalism, the rate of energy transfer to the GND-Ag NP plane is expressed as (6)
By integration, the PRET efficiency can be expressed as (7)where ΓAg is the surface density of the GND-Ag NPs and d = rAg + hCP + hspacer is the separation between the CP film and GND-Ag NP layer, which includes the radii of the Ag NPs supported by GNDs, rAg, as well as the thicknesses of the CP film, hCP, and the spacer layer, hspacer. It can be seen that the PRET efficiency of a CP thin film interacting with a plane of GND-Ag NP acceptors shows d−4 dependence as opposed to the d−6 dependence observed in FRET for a single donor–acceptor pair.
Therefore, the efficient steady-state and transient-state PL quenching of Qsteady and Qtransient, respectively, are signatures of the nonradiative energy transfer mechanism from the CP film to the GND-Ag NP layer; also, the energy transfer efficiency, E = Qsteady = Qtransient = 1 − I′/I0, can be simply and respectively calculated from the steady-state and transient-state PL integrated spectral emissions of the CP reference film, I0, and that of the film deposited on top of the GND-Ag NP layers, I′. The GND-Ag NP density dependence of energy transfer efficiency can first be fitted using eqn (7) and analyzed within the PRET model. Because rAg = 2.5 nm, hspacer = 0, and the hCP values for PFO, F8BT and MEH-PPV films estimated by AFM analysis are 3 nm, 2 nm and 20 nm, respectively, the characteristic distance, d0, can be determined by the fit. The best fits of steady and transient PL quenching data are shown as solid and dashed lines on each of the graphs in Fig. 3, and the extracted d0 values are given on each graph. It can be noted that the trend of the experimental data can be well predicted by the form of eqn (7), although there are still deviations of the fitting results in the steady and transient quenching methods, especially for the MEH-PPV film. The determined d0 is in the range of 2 to 12 nm and in the increasing order of F8BT (2.5 to 3.2 nm), PFO (5.9 to 6.3 nm) and MEH-PPV (8.3 to 11.6 nm). Then, we can compare the obtained d0 values with the Förster radius (R0) of the conjugated polymer to a non-nanometal quencher, which is usually determined by PL quenching experiments based on FRET theory (Table S2†). The d0 is assumed to be in the same range as the reported R0, and some of them are even larger (e.g., for FRET from MEH-PPV to C60, the R0 value was 3.4 nm). These results can be understood by the reported observation that the use of a metal nanoparticle as a proximal quencher of a fluorophore by PRET has the ability to more than double the range of FRET quenching and exhibits d−4 distance dependence instead of d−6 distance dependence for PL quenching.53

The PL quenching efficiency was determined from the integrated steady PL spectra (solid black cube) and the integrated transient PL spectra (open blue circle) for the overall ensemble emission, respectively. The error bars represent the standard deviation of five measurements. The solid black and blue dashed lines represent the fits of the steady and transient PL quenching efficiency within a PRET model, respectively. The thicknesses of the CP films h and the fitted d0 values are shown in the insets. 
The separation dependence can be further analyzed within the PRET model. The distance between the GND-Ag NP layer and CP film was controlled by the spacer-layer thickness with nanometer accuracy using layer-by-layer assemblies consisting of oppositely charged PDDA/PSS polyelectrolytes. The average thickness of one bilayer of PDDA/PSS was estimated to be 0.99 nm from the UV-vis spectra and AFM investigation (Fig. S9 and S10†). The absorption spectra of the bilayer structures as a function of spacer thickness are shown in Fig. S11.† Unexpectedly, the optical densities of the composite films show a monotonic decrease with increasing thickness of the assembly layer of PDDA/PSS, especially at longer wavelength regions far from the intrinsic absorption of the polyelectrolytes (Fig. 4a). This indicates that when F8BT molecules are placed near the GND-Ag NPs, the optical absorption can be enhanced. Khurgin and Sun54 deduced that the absorption rate σ of a molecule located at distance d from a metal sphere can be expressed as σ ∝ d−6; this indicates that the strongest absorption enhancement is attainable for molecules placed close to the metal NPs, while for the absorbers spread out only several nanometers farther from the NPs, the absorption enhancement is far more modest, if it exists at all. For F8BTs, the PL emission quenching increases as the separation between the CP film and GND-Ag NP monolayer decreases, and the lifetime shortens as the CP film is located in closer proximity to the GND-Ag NP layer (Fig. S12†). The distance-dependent quenching as a function of the polyelectrolyte spacer layer thickness is shown in Fig. 4b. The characteristic radius d0 can be determined by fitting the experimental steady and transient PL quenching efficiencies within the PRET model, and the results show close agreement with the values determined from the surface density-dependent PL analysis.

(b) Separation dependence of the quenching efficiency of the bilayer structure. The PL quenching efficiency was determined from the integrated steady PL spectra (solid black cubes) and the integrated transient PL spectra (open blue circles) for the overall ensemble emission, respectively. The error bars represent the standard deviation of five measurements. The solid black and blue dashed lines represent the fits of the steady and transient PL quenching efficiencies within a PRET model, respectively. 
Conductivity
At this point, we assume that the GND-Ag NPs are also conducive to the separation of photo-generated excitons, thus improving the efficiency of light harvesting. Fig. S13† shows the photocurrent density versus time curves of F8BT and GND-Ag NPs/F8BT electrodes measured at a bias potential of 1.23 V vs. SCE under chopped light illumination. The photocurrent rapidly increases under illumination and decreases to nearly zero at a similarly rapid rate when the light is blocked over several on–off cycles. The photocurrent density of GND-Ag NPs/F8BT (14 μA cm−2) is about two times higher than that of F8BT, demonstrating the faster charge transfer in the GND-Ag NPs/F8BT electrodes. This enhancement reveals that the GND-Ag NP layer is effective to improve the electrical conductivity and enhance the charge transport in the F8BT film.55,56 Conductive AFM was used to gain insight into nanoscale variation in the dark currents across the GND-Ag NPs/F8BT active layer. In this imaging mode, a gold-coated silicon probe is used to simultaneously obtain surface topographic and current images in the absence of illumination. The current was measured between the underlying ITO electrode and Au-coated silicon tip with a 7 V bias applied to the substrate. The results of these studies, shown in Fig. 5, reveal that GND-Ag NPs/F8BT shows an enhanced net current of 200 to 1000 pA, compared with only 5 to 10 pA measured in the pristine F8BT film. It is noted that the macroscopic “dots” pattern of the current diagram of the GND-Ag NPs/F8BT films is more consistent with the AFM morphology of the GND-Ag NPs presented in Fig. 1e, which suggests that the current enhancement mainly results from the underlying GND-Ag NPs.

Conclusion
In summary, we observed the emission quenching of three typical conjugated polymers (PFO, F8BT and MEH-PPV) in proximity to a plane of sub-10 nm silver nanoparticles. D = 3.2 nm Ag NPs with highly uniform morphologies and narrow size distributions were prepared using GNDs as templates through photoreduction. The enhancement of the IR and Raman spectra of the GNDs illustrates the strong plasmonic near-field of the supported Ag NPs. Both the steady and transient PL spectra confirmed that the GND-Ag NPs plane shows over 80% quenching efficiency for all the spin-coated CP films, which can be controlled by the GND-Ag NPs surface density and spacer distance. The quenching data were analyzed within the PRET model, and the extracted characteristic distances are 6 nm, 3 nm and 10 nm for 3 nm thick PFO, 2 nm thick F8BT and 20 nm thick MEH-PPV films, respectively. The photocurrent densities of the F8BT films on top of the GND-Ag NPs substrate were found to be greatly enhanced, which suggests that the GND-Ag NPs are a promising material for organic photovoltaics and photocatalysis.
