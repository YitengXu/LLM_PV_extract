    , Accepted 19th January 2016First published on 19th January 2016AbstractTwo new Y-shaped D–π–(A)2 type phenothiazine-based dyes (ZJA2 and ZJA3) were designed and synthesized for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Compared to the single D–π–A analogue dye ZJA1, the Y-shaped dye with two carboxylic acid anchors was in favour of enhancing the performance of DSSCs. The FTIR spectra revealed that the dye ZJA2 molecules were anchored onto the TiO2 surface by two carboxylic acid anchors, which effectively increased the electron extraction channels. The steady-state emission spectra and time-resolved fluorescence experiments all indicated that the electron injection efficiency of dye ZJA2 was improved by the increased electron extraction channels, thus the Jsc of ZJA2 was greatly improved compared to dye ZJA1. In addition, benzene was used as the π-bridge for linking di-anchoring groups, combined with CDCA, thereby reducing the charge recombination. As a result, the PCE of the DSSC based on ZJA2 (4.55%) was 67% higher than the DSSC based on ZJA1 (2.72%). The Y-shaped D–π–(A)2 type phenothiazine-based dye ZJA3 containing two pyridine anchors was also investigated, and the DSSC based on ZJA3 showed a poor PCE (0.45%) due to the low dye loading.
Introduction
Fossil energy crisis and environment pollution are common issues to the whole world, developing renewable clean energy is one of the important means to solve this problem. Among the emerging photovoltaic technologies, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted significant attention due to their low cost and high power conversion efficiency (PCE).1–4 Up to now, DSSCs have made remarkable progress and the highest PCE has reached 13% under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight illumination.5 Efficient sensitizers can greatly improve the performance of DSSCs. Through years of research and development, many excellent sensitizers have been prepared, including ruthenium-complexes (N3 and N719),6–8 zinc porphyrin dyes (YD2-O-C8 and SM315) and organic dyes (C219 and Y123).9–14 Nevertheless, the performance of these sensitizers is greatly less than the ideal sensitizer. Thus, the improvement of sensitizers is still one of the most important researching directions to promote the development of DSSCs.15
It is well-known that most of the excellent sensitizers have the donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) structures.16,17 The special structure is associated with the efficient intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT) photoexcitation from the donor (D) to the acceptor (A), thus leading to efficient electron injection from the excited dye through anchoring groups into the conduction band of the semiconductor. For an efficient dye, choosing an appropriate anchoring group moiety is particularly important. The anchoring group determines the binding energy of the dye on TiO2 and the electron injection rate.18,19 Most of the D–π–A dyes use carboxylic acid as the electron acceptor as well as the anchoring group for attachment on the TiO2 surface. The carboxylic acid group can provide a high electron injection rate for its good electronic coupling between dye and TiO2 by forming a strong monodentate or bidentate linkage with Brønsted acid sites (surface bound hydroxyl groups, Ti–OH) on the TiO2 surface.20–24 On the other hand, with the development of DSSCs, several new anchoring groups have been developed, such as pyridine, phosphonic acid and silyl.25–29 But the single 1D–π–1A sensitizer often has a rod-shaped structure, which may cause undesirable dye aggregation and charge recombination. Because the 1D–π–1A type dye provides close π–π stacking of dye molecules which may lead to serious self-quenching of excited states and hence reduces the electron injection.30,31 One of the effective strategies to solve this problem is employing multi-anchors for DSSCs. The dyes with multi-anchors for DSSCs can increase electron extraction channels and enhance binding strength, thereby suppressing the charge recombination and improving the performance of DSSCs.32,33 In recent years, several efficient dyes containing double/multi anchoring groups have been reported and applied in DSSCs. Some literature studies reported that the dyes with two acceptors/anchors (D–π–(A)2) had better cell performance than those with a single acceptor/anchor (D–π–A) due to improved photocurrent and stability.34–39
In this study, two Y-shaped D–π–(A)2 type phenothiazine-based dyes (ZJA2 and ZJA3) were designed and synthesized. The single D–π–A phenothiazine-based dye (ZJA1) with a mono-anchoring group was also prepared for comparison (Fig. 1). Two 9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluorene groups were introduced into the phenothiazine moiety as the donors (D), this strategy can effectively extend the π-conjugation and improve the photoresponse. The results indicated that the short-circuit current density (Jsc) of ZJA2 was greatly improved compared to ZJA1, due to the increased electron extraction channels and higher electron injection efficiency. We knew that benzene and heterocycles (thiophene or furan) have been widely used as the π-bridge linkers in many excellent dyes. In general, the benzene bridge results in a high open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) compared to heterocycles. The main reason is that the benzene bridge can induce twist in the molecular planarity, thus reducing the charge recombination.40 So we used benzene as the π-bridge for linking di-anchoring groups, in addition, chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) was also used to suppress the dye aggregation. Thus, the Jsc and Voc of dye ZJA2 containing two carboxylic acid anchors were both improved compared to dye ZJA1 containing one carboxylic acid anchor. As a result, the PCE of the DSSC based on ZJA2 (4.55%) was superior to the DSSC based on ZJA1 (2.72%). We also investigated the difference between different anchoring groups (carboxylic acid and pyridine), the results indicated that the dye ZJA3 showed the poorest PCE (0.45%) due to the low dye loading.

Experimental
General information
All solvents used were purified by standard methods, and all chemicals were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification unless indicated otherwise. The 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX (500, 400 and 300 MHz) NMR spectrometer with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard. The mass spectra were measured using an ESI Mass Spectrometer (LCQ Fleet).
Synthesis and characterization of dyes
The synthetic routes of ZJA1, ZJA2 and ZJA3 are depicted in Scheme 1. The synthesis details and characterization data (including 1H NMR, 13C NMR and ESI) are shown in the ESI.†

Fabrication of DSSCs
The photoanode (0.16 cm2) was prepared by screen printing the TiO2 paste on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass plates (15 Ω sq−1). TiO2 films (12 μm) consist of a 8 μm transparent layer (particle size, 20 nm, pore size 32 nm) and a 4 μm scattering layer (200 nm particles). Before the screen printing process, the FTO glass plates were immersed in 40 mM TiCl4 (aqueous) at 70 °C for 30 min and washed with water and ethanol. Then the TiO2 films were treated using a programmed procedure: (1) heating at 80 °C for 15 min; (2) heating at 135 °C for 10 min; (3) heating at 325 °C for 30 min; (4) heating at 375 °C for 5 min; (5) heating at 450 °C for 15 min, and (6) heating at 500 °C for 15 min. Then the films were treated again with TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 min and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. After cooling, the films were immersed into a solution of dye (0.5 mM) and CDCA (5 mM) in CHCl3/EtOH (V/V, 1/1) for 18 h at room temperature. The photoanodes and the Pt counter electrode were sealed with a Surlyn film (25 μm) at 100 °C. The electrolyte was introduced to the cells via pre-drilled holes in the counter electrode, the hole was sealed with a Surlyn film and a thin glass (0.1 mm thickness) cover by heating. Al foil was taped at the back side of each counter electrode to reflect the unadsorbed light. The electrolyte was composed of 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII), 30 mM I2, 50 mM LiI, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GuNCS) in a solvent mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15, V/V).
Characterization
The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices were measured on a Keithley 2400 source meter under an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 at the surface of a testing cell by a xenon light source (Oriel). The incident photo-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the devices were measured using a DC method. The light source was a 300 W xenon lamp (Oriel 6258) coupled with a flux controller to improve the stability of irradiance. The single wavelength was selected by a monochromator (Cornerstone 260 Oriel74125). Light intensity was measured using a NREL traceable Si detector (Oriel 71030NS) and the short circuit currents of the devices were measured using an optical power meter (Oriel 70310).
The UV-vis absorption spectra of dyes in DMF and dye-loaded films were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometer. The fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer LS55 spectrophotometer. The FTIR spectra were recorded on a Vector22 spectrometer. The time-resolved fluorescence lifetimes of the dyes in DMF and dye-loaded films were measured on a FLS920 spectrometer. Quasi-reversible oxidation and reduction waves were recorded on a Chenhua CHI660D model Electrochemical Workstation (Shanghai). Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy was carried out using a Chenhua CHI660I model Electrochemical Workstation (Shanghai).
The dye loading was measured using a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometer. The sensitized 0.16 cm2 electrodes were immersed into a 0.1 M NaOH solution in a mixed solvent (water/DMF = 1/1), which resulted in the desorption of each dye.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
In this work, three new phenothiazine-based dyes (ZJA1, ZJA2 and ZJA3) were synthesized and applied in dye-sensitized solar cells. The structures of the three dyes and the synthetic route are shown in Fig. 1 and Scheme 1, respectively. The corresponding 1H NMR, 13C NMR and MS are also given in the ESI.† We further studied the optical properties, electrochemical properties, electron injection dynamic and charge transfer processes.
Optical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of ZJA1, ZJA2 and ZJA3 in DMF are shown in Fig. 2 and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. The three dyes all have two major absorption bands in the range of 350–550 nm. The absorption band below 400 nm can be attributed to the π–π* transition of the conjugated molecules, and the absorption band in the range of 400–550 nm can be attributed to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). They all exhibited high molar extinction coefficients (ε) in the visible absorption band, and the ε value of the three dyes reached 2.89 × 104 M−1 cm−1 (ZJA1), 3.42 × 104 M−1 cm−1 (ZJA2) and 2.64 × 104 M−1 cm−1 (ZJA3), respectively. Especially for dye ZJA2, though it was slightly blue-shifted (3 nm) compared to dye ZJA1 (due to non-planar structure between benzene and the two benzoic acid acceptors for ZJA2), the ε value of ZJA2 was about 1.2-fold higher than that of ZJA1. The absorption spectra of the three dyes anchored onto TiO2 films were also investigated (Fig. 2b). We used CDCA as a coadsorbent to prevent dye aggregation on the TiO2 surface. It was clear that the absorption peaks of the three dyes were all nearly not changed. The result indicated that the strategy successfully suppresses dye aggregation on the TiO2 surface, including two aspects of H-aggregation (blue-shift) and J-aggregation (red-shift) in adsorption. In addition, the spectral response of the three dyes anchored on the TiO2 surface was all broadened. Especially for ZJA2 in the visible absorption band range, it exhibited a significant enhancement compared to ZJA1. The result is in favour of improving the light-harvesting ability. The low absorption intensity of ZJA3 was mainly attributed to the low dye loading.

Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of dyes are very important for DSSCs, which can have an effect on the ability of electron injection from the excited dyes into the conduction band of TiO2 and the dye regeneration. The cyclic voltammograms of the dyes are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†) and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, the ground state oxidation potentials (Eox) of the dyes are 1.07 V (ZJA1), 1.03 V (ZJA2) and 1.09 V (ZJA3), respectively. They are all more positive than the redox potential of the I−/I3− redox couple (0.4 V vs. NHE), ensuring an efficient driving force to achieve regeneration from the oxidized dyes. The zero–zero excitation energy (E0–0) was estimated from the absorption onset. The E0–0 values of the dyes are 2.33 eV (ZJA1), 2.31 eV (ZJA2) and 2.36 eV (ZJA3), respectively. The excited oxidation potentials (Eox*) of the three dyes are −1.26 V (ZJA1), −1.28 V (ZJA2) and −1.27 V (ZJA3), respectively. They are all more negative than the Fermi level of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE), which suggests that the electron from the excited dyes can effectively inject into the conduction band of TiO2.42
The anchoring mode analysis
In order to investigate the adsorption states of the three dyes on TiO2 films, we measured the FTIR spectra of the dye powders and the dyes adsorbed on TiO2 films (Fig. S3, ESI†). For powder of dye ZJA1, the carbonyl peak was found at 1688 cm−1, and disappeared after anchoring on TiO2 film. And a new band appeared at 1624 cm−1, which represented the antisymmetric stretching ν(COOas−).43,44 This observation indicates that dye ZJA1 adsorbs at the TiO2 surface via dehydration reactions. For powder of D–π–(A)2 dye ZJA2, the carbonyl peak was found at 1692 cm−1. After being anchored on the TiO2 surface, the carbonyl peak disappeared completely. As well as for dye ZJA1, a new band appeared at 1627 cm−1, which also represented the antisymmetric stretching ν(COOas−). The result suggests that the D–π–(A)2 dye was chemically adsorbed on the TiO2 surface via di-anchoring mode. Dye ZJA3 containing two pyridine anchors was also measured. For powder of dye ZJA3, the characteristic stretching bands for CN or CC were observed at 1598 cm−1, 1476 cm−1 and 1446 cm−1. After being anchored on the TiO2 surface, a new band appeared at 1616 cm−1, which can be assigned to the pyridine anchor coordinated to the Lewis acid sites of the TiO2 surface.25,26
Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs
The DSSCs were measured under AM 1.5G irradiation, the effective area of all DSSCs was 0.16 cm2, and the photoanode was immersed in a solution of the dyes (0.5 mM) and CDCA (5 mM) in CHCl3/EtOH (V/V, 1/1) for 18 h at room temperature.
The photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs based on the three dyes under AM 1.5G irradiation has been investigated (Fig. 3), and the corresponding parameters are shown in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 3a, the current density–voltage (J–V) curve of DSSCs based on ZJA1 exhibited a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 6.45 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 656 mV and a fill factor (FF) of 64.3%, generating a PCE of 2.72%. It is worth noting that the performance of DSSCs based on ZJA2 was greatly improved compared to the DSSC based on ZJA1. Through introducing two carboxylic acid anchors by the benzene bridge for dye ZJA2, the PCE of DSSCs based on ZJA2 (4.55%) is about 67% higher than that of DSSCs based on ZJA1. The Jsc (9.62 mA cm−2) and Voc (704 mV) of DSSCs based on ZJA2 were both much higher than those of DSSCs based on ZJA1. The results suggest that it is an effective strategy to improve the performance of DSSCs by introducing di-anchoring groups through the benzene bridge. The DSSC based on ZJA3 exhibited a poor PCE of 0.45%, the Jsc, Voc and FF were all very low, and the main reason is attributed to the low dye loading. The values of dye loading for ZJA1 and ZJA2 are 2.13 × 10−7 mol cm−2 and 3.24 × 10−7 mol cm−2, respectively. In contrast, the value of dye loading for ZJA3 is only 0.38 × 10−7 mol cm−2. The incident photo-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of DSSCs based on the three dyes were also investigated, as shown in Fig. 3b. It is easy to find that ZJA2 shows a higher value than the other two dyes. The IPCE value of DSSCs based on ZJA2 is more than 50% in the region of 387–455 nm and with a maximum value of 60.7% at 423 nm, while the maximum values of ZJA1 and ZJA3 are 46.6% and 25.2%, respectively. The result is consistent with Jsc of the DSSCs. We also measured the light-harvesting efficiency (LHE) of the dyes on TiO2 films (Fig. S4, ESI†). The result is consistent with IPCE of the DSSCs.45–47

The electron injection dynamic studies
The time-resolved fluorescence experiments and steady-state fluorescence experiments on ZJA1, ZJA2 and ZJA3 were carried out to investigate the difference in the electron injection dynamic of the three dyes. Fig. 4 shows the time-resolved luminescence of the two dyes in DMF and adsorbed on TiO2, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 3.5,9,11 In DMF, the fluorescence lifetime values of ZJA1, ZJA2 and ZJA3 are 2.73 ns, 3.57 ns and 3.47 ns, respectively. It is clear that the excited-state lifetimes of ZJA2 and ZJA3 are both longer than those of ZJA1. When the three dyes are adsorbed on TiO2 films, the fluorescence of the three dyes decayed rapidly. On the TiO2 films, the fluorescence lifetime values of ZJA1, ZJA2 and ZJA3 are 670 ps, 410 ps and 490 ps, respectively. Compared to ZJA1, the emission decay of ZJA2 and ZJA3 was both further enhanced, especially for ZJA2. The results indicated that the excited charge transfer from ZJA2 to the conduction band of TiO2 may be more effective than that in the case of ZJA1. We further carried out the steady-state fluorescence experiments to confirm the inference (Fig. S5, ESI†). Because the excited-state injection cannot occur onto Al2O3, the excited-state properties of the three dyes were evaluated on Al2O3. When the three dyes were adsorbed on TiO2, fluorescence from ZJA1 and ZJA3 was quenched about 78% and 82%, respectively, while the fluorescence from ZJA2 was quenched about 92% relative to ZJA2–Al2O3. This suggests that the injection quantum yield of ZJA2 and ZJA3 is both higher than that of ZJA1.48 Thus, the electron injection efficiency of the dye containing di-anchoring groups was improved.

The charge recombination process studies
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a very useful tool for DSSCs. Many researchers often used it to investigate the interfacial charge recombination process under dark conditions.49,50 The EIS spectra of the DSSCs based on the three dyes were measured at an applied voltage of −0.6 V, and scanned from 105 to 1 Hz. The Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 5 and we can see two semicircles in the plots. We know that the large semicircle represents the charge recombination process at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, and the small semicircle represents the charge transport at the Pt/electrolyte interface. The radius of the large semicircle corresponds to the charge recombination resistance (Rrec). The larger charge recombination resistance value stands for the lower charge recombination rate. Obviously, with the same electrode materials and the same electrolyte, the DSSC based on ZJA2 showed the largest Rrec. The result indicated that dye ZJA2 with two carboxylic acid anchors can more effectively reduce charge recombination than dye ZJA1 with single carboxylic acid anchor. The Rrec result is also consistent with the Voc of the DSSCs. As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), we infer that the large twist angles between the benzene bridge and the two benzoic acid acceptors (about 37°) may block the penetration of the electrolyte through the dye forest. This is helpful to reduce the charge recombination, similar to the previous reports in the literature studies.37,40

Conclusions
In summary, two new Y-shaped phenothiazine-based dyes (ZJA2 and ZJA3) containing di-anchoring groups were synthesized and applied in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Compared to the single D–π–A analogue dye ZJA1, the PCE of the DSSC based on ZJA2 (4.55%) was about 67% higher than that of the DSSC based on ZJA1 (2.72%). The results indicated that introduced two carboxylic acid anchors by the benzene bridge in the design of sensitizers can effectively improve the performance of DSSCs. This work presents a new strategy to designing efficient dye with improved electron injection efficiency and reduced charge recombination toward high-performance DSSCs.
