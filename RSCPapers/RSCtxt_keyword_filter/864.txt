    , Accepted 28th January 2014First published on 5th February 2014AbstractNovel organic sensitizers comprising one or two fluorenylidene moieties in the donor part of triarylamine, cyanoacrylic acid as the acceptor/anchoring group and a fluorene and oligothiophene spacer in a D–π–A architecture have been synthesized and characterized as sensitizers for nanocrystalline TiO2-based dye-sensitized solar cells. Their optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties are compared with the electron accepting dicyanovinyl unit containing the organic sensitizer. Incorporation of the fluorenylidene moiety dominates the optical properties of the dyes in terms of relatively broad and high molar extinction coefficient absorption when compared to the dicyanovinyl derivatives. Theoretical investigations using TDDFT simulations indicate that the trends in the excitation energies are consistent with the solution spectral data for higher wavelength absorption and the lower wavelength absorptions attributed to the amine to auxiliary acceptor charge transfer. The electrochemical properties are influenced by the number of fluorenylidene chromophores and the electron richness of the linking segment. The dye-sensitized solar cells fabricated using fluorenylidene-based sensitizers showed higher power conversion efficiency than the dicyanovinyl derivatives attributed to their higher photocurrent density. A fluorenylidene-based dye exhibited a high power conversion efficiency of 6.13% under full sunlight (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2).
Introduction
Though several alternate energy technologies have been researched to overcome the global energy crisis, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)1 received immense attention due to their low-cost fabrication, transparency and flexibility in the scaling process relative to silicon solar cells.2 In DSSCs, light is absorbed by dye molecules adsorbed on the mesoporous nanocrystalline semiconductor metal oxide, generally TiO2. Light irradiation of dye molecules causes photo-induced charge separation followed by electron injection into the conduction band of the semiconductor. The regeneration of the oxidized dye was accomplished by a redox mediator. Efficiency of DSSCs depends on the Fermi level of the semiconductor, the redox potential of the redox mediator and particularly the light-harvesting property of the dye.3–5 Light-absorption and charge separation in the dyes can be efficiently tuned by structural engineering with appropriate chemical modifications. As the electronic structure of the organic dyes responds to slight structural modifications more drastically than the Ru-based organometallic dyes,6,7 the structure–property relationship in metal-free organic dyes was evaluated by several research groups actively. Organic dyes possessing several structural configurations and functional chromophores have been explored. Besides the basic donor–π bridge–acceptor (D–π–A)8 architecture, designs with auxiliary donors (D–π–D–π–A)9,22a–c and auxiliary acceptors (D–π–A–π–A)10 have been investigated. In general donor groups such as triphenylamine, substituted triphenylamine, triarylamine, indoline, tetrahydroquinoline, phenothiazine, phenoxazine, and carbazole11 with various linkers like biphenyl, terphenyl, fluorene, oligothiophene, anthracene, benzothiadizole, benzotriazole, diketo-pyrrolopyrrole, thienopyrazine, and thiazole12 and different acceptor/anchoring groups such as cyanoacrylic acid, rhodanine acetic acid, and pyridine13 have been used to construct organic sensitizers. However, the performances of DSSCs using organic sensitizers are slightly inferior to those employing organometallic light absorbers. The foremost reasons behind this are π-stacking interaction between the dye molecules that leads to aggregate formation on the semiconductor surface and recombination of conduction band electrons with the redox mediator in the electrolyte that decreases the open circuit voltage (VOC).5
Since most of the sensitizers have a rod-shaped configuration therefore they are prone to π–π stacking interactions that cause self-quenching and instability of organic dyes.14 In order to reduce these stacking interactions Hara and co-workers15 introduced long alkyl chains to the π-conjugated segment and obtained an increment in VOC. Later on Tian and co-workers16 employed starburst triphenylamine as a donor to the organic sensitizers and found retardation in the charge recombination process of injected electrons with triiodide. Besides these, some researchers have suggested that by modifying the periphery of sensitizers via introduction of bulky alkyl/alkoxy chains can also slow down the electron recombination.17 In a few reports, the tert-butyl moiety was introduced in the donor segment to prevent aggregation.18 Interestingly, in a recent report tetraphenylethylene (TPE)19 was used as an additional chromophore to decorate the triphenylamine donor. It was observed that the TPE moieties not only reduce the intermolecular π–π stacking interactions but also block the charge recombination to a certain degree.
Fluorene has been extensively used in several organic dyes for OLEDs20 and DSSCs,21 where it acts as an electron rich segment to enhance the charge transport characteristics. Moreover the rigidity present in the fluorene enhances the quantum efficiency of the molecule. To date, fluorene has been used in the sensitizers either as an aromatic π-linker21 or as an aryl segment in the triarylamine donor unit.22 In this work, D–π–A sensitizers (Fig. 1) containing one or two fluorenylidene moieties in the donor part of triarylamine, cyanoacrylic acid as the acceptor/anchoring group, and the thiophene or bithiophene group as the conjugate bridge were synthesized and applied to DSSCs. Tetraphenylethylene, triphenylethylene and diphenylethylene derivatives,19,23 particularly those containing fluorogenic chromophores have received immense attention in recent years owing to their potential to act as strong solid state emitters in electroluminescent devices. The pronounced emission of this class of compounds in the highly concentrated solutions or solid state is attributed to retardation of the rotation of phenyl groups in the closely packed configurations, which reduces the competing relaxation processes from the excited state. Reduction of emissive and vibrational relaxation of the excited state is essential for the light harvesting properties of the sensitizers applied in DSSCs as well.24 This will facilitate charge separation in the excited state and thereby increase the electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2. Radiative relaxation of donor–acceptor compounds is less favourable in polar medium and in particular in the presence of electron scavengers. But vibrational quenching is dormant in systems containing flexible alkyl chains and multiple phenyl rings.25 We felt that the introduction of the fluorenylidene unit over the diphenylethylene group will be attractive for two reasons: (1) free rotation of the phenyl groups is arrested due to the rigidification of the structure by the fusion of the phenyl rings in the fluorenylidene unit. (2) The fluorenylidene unit will help to delocalize the positive charge generated on the amine unit on removal of electrons and should help to reduce the back electron transfer from the conduction band to oxidized dye. The introduction of one fluorenylidene moiety to the donor part is found to be beneficial for enhancing the spectral response in the visible region and consequently better photovoltaic performance of DSSCs was obtained when compared to the control dyes D1 and D2. Furthermore, DSSCs based on two fluorenylidene units in the donor showed a comparatively low performance due to more pronounced influence on the electronic structure of the dye. Additionally, to corroborate this observation a sensitizer (5e) with a strong electron-accepting dicyanovinyl unit was also prepared. Dicyanovinyl being a strong electron-withdrawing group severely affected the electronic structure of the dye and reduced the sensitizer's performance due to the low-lying LUMO which diminishes the thermodynamic driving force for electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2.

Experimental
Materials and general methods
All the reactions and manipulations were carried out under an N2 atmosphere with the use of standard inert atmosphere techniques. Solvents were dried by standard procedures. All column chromatography purifications were performed with the use of 100–200 mesh silica gel or neutral alumina as the stationary phase in a column 30 cm long and 2.0 cm diameter. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured by using a Bruker 500 MHz spectrometer. Mass spectra were recorded in positive-ion mode on an ESI TOF high-resolution mass spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetric experiments were carried out at room temperature with a conventional three-electrode configuration consisting of a glassy carbon working electrode, a platinum wire auxiliary electrode, and a nonaqueous Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode. The E1/2 values were determined as 1/2(Eap + Ecp), where Eap and Ecp are the anodic and cathodic peak potentials, respectively. The potentials are quoted against the ferrocene internal standard. The solvent in all experiments was dichloromethane and the supporting electrolyte was 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate. Electronic absorption spectra were obtained on a UV-visible spectrophotometer using freshly prepared solutions.

Computational methods
All the computations were performed with the Gaussian 09 program package in a HP computer workstation. The ground-state geometries were fully optimized without any symmetry constraints at the DFT level with Becke's three parameter hybrid functional and Lee, Yang and Parr's correlational functional (B3LYP) using 6-31G(d, p) basis set on all atoms. The default parameters for the convergence criteria were used. Vibrational analyses on the optimized structures were performed to confirm the structure. The excitation energies and oscillatory strengths for the lowest 10 singlet transitions at the optimized geometry in the ground state were obtained by TD-DFT calculations using the same basis set as for the geometry minimization.
DSSC fabrication and characterization
A fluorine-doped SnO2 conducting glass (FTO, 7 Ω sq−1, transmittance ∼80%) was first cleaned with a neutral cleaner and then washed with deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol, sequentially. The conducting surface of the FTO was treated with a solution of titanium tetraisopropoxide (1 g) in 2-methoxyethanol (3 g) to obtain good mechanical contact between the conducting glass and TiO2 film, as well as to isolate the conducting glass surface from the electrolyte. TiO2 pastes were coated onto the treated conducting glass by using the doctor blade technique. To coat each TiO2 layer, the dried TiO2 film was gradually heated to 450 °C in an oxygen atmosphere and subsequently sintered at that temperature for 30 min. The TiO2 photoanodes of the DSSCs employed in the experiments were composed of a 12 μm thick transparent TiO2 (20 nm) layer with a scattering TiO2 (300 nm) layer of 4 μm thickness. After sintering at 450 °C and cooling to 80 °C, the TiO2 film was immersed in the dye solution (3 × 10−4 M) at room temperature for 24 h. The standard ruthenium complex, N719, was dissolved in acetonitrile (ACN) and tert-butyl alcohol (volume ratio of 1:1) to make a reference dye solution. Various organic dye solutions were prepared in a mixing solvent containing ACN, tert-butyl alcohol, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (volume ratio of 3.5:3.5:3). The thus prepared dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode was placed on a platinum-sputtered conducting glass electrode (ITO, 7 Ω sq−1), keeping the two electrodes separated by a 25 μm thick Surlyn® film. The two electrodes were then sealed by heating. The electrolyte was composed of 0.1 M LiI, 0.6 M 1-propyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.05 M I2 and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in a solvent mixture of acetonitrile(ACN)–3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN) with a volume ratio of 1:1. The electrolyte was injected into the gap between the electrodes by capillarity; the electrolyte-injecting hole was previously made in the counter electrode with a drilling machine, and the hole was sealed with hot-melt glue after the injection of the electrolyte.
The surface of the DSSCs was covered by a mask with a light-illuminated area of 0.16 cm2 and then illuminated by using a class A quality solar simulator (XES-301S, AM 1.5G, San-Ei Electric Co., Ltd.). Incident light intensity (100 mW cm−2) was calibrated with a standard silicon cell (PECSI01, Peccell Technologies, Inc.). Photocurrent–voltage curves of the DSSCs were obtained with a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT30, Autolab, Eco-Chemie, The Netherlands). The thickness of the TiO2 film was judged by scanning electron microscopy. For UV-visible absorption spectra, dye molecules were coated on the TiO2 films, and the corresponding spectra were recorded using a JASCO UV-vis spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere. The baseline was corrected with a bare TiO2 coated FTO substrate. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were obtained from the potentiostat/galvanostat, equipped with an FRA2module, under a constant light illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The frequency range explored was 10–65 kHz. The applied bias voltage was set at the open-circuit voltage of the DSSC between the ITO-Pt counter electrode and the FTO–TiO2–dye working electrode, starting from the short-circuit conditions; the corresponding AC amplitude was 10 mV. The impedance spectra were analyzed using an equivalent circuit model. Incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves were obtained under short-circuit conditions. The light source was a class A quality solar simulator (PEC-L11, AM 1.5G); light was focused through a monochromator onto the photovoltaic cell. The monochromator was incremented through the visible spectrum to generate the IPCE (λ) as defined by IPCE (λ) = 1240 (JSC/λφ), where λ is the wavelength, JSC is the short-circuit photocurrent density (mA cm−2) recorded using a potentiostat/galvanostat, and φ is the incident radiative flux (W m−2) measured with an optical detector and a power meter.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The syntheses of the sensitizers, 5a–5e, were achieved in four steps by a synthetic pathway displayed in Scheme 1. 7-Bromo-9,9-diethyl-N,N-diphenyl-9H-fluoren-2-amine (1) was synthesized by a stoichiometrically controlled C–N cross-coupling reaction between 2,7-dibromo-9,9-diethylfluorene and diphenylamine.21c Subsequent Vilsmeier–Haack formylation of 1 using DMF/POCl3 in suitable compositions produced the mono (2a) and di-aldehydes (2b) in reasonable yields. The aldehydes were condensed with 9H-fluorene in the presence of a strong base to obtain the fluorenylidene derivatives 3a and 3b, while the Knoevenagel reaction of 2a with malononitrile gave 3c. These precursors were treated with the appropriate stannylenes under the Stille reaction26 conditions followed by acid hydrolysis to obtain the required aldehydes 4a–4e. Finally, the fluorenylidene/dicyanovinyl functionalized organic dyes, 5a–5e, were obtained via Knoevenagel condensation of cyanoacetic acid with the aldehydes (4a–4e) in the presence of ammonium acetate.

Photophysical properties
The optical spectra of the dyes recorded in dichloromethane (DCM) are displayed in Fig. 2 and the pertinent data are compiled in Table 1. All the dyes exhibit an intense absorption between 430 and 470 nm attributable to the combination of electronic transitions originating from π–π* and intramolecular charge transfer (CT) excitations (vide supra). In general, the absorption spectra of the fluorenylidene dyes 5a–5d showed relatively broad and high molar extinction coefficient absorption when compared to the dicyanovinyl derivative 5e. Apparently, the presence of the fluorenylidene unit extends the conjugative delocalization within the amine segment and red-shifts the π–π* transition. The mono-fluorenylidene derivatives (5a and 5b) displayed broad and red-shifted absorption when compared to the bis-fluorenylidene analogues (5c and 5d). In the case of 5a and 5b probably the π–π* and CT transitions are partially resolved. But in the 5c and 5d dyes they are merged due to the red-shifted π–π* transition originating from the extended donor segment conjugation and blue-shift in the CT transition arising because of the diminished donor strength of the amine and consequent donor–acceptor interaction. The donor strength of the amine in 5c and 5d is probably reduced due to delocalization of lone pair of electrons on the amine into two fluorenylidene segments. Similarly, the dyes containing bithiophene (5b and 5d) in the conjugation exhibit intense and broad absorption when compared to the corresponding dyes with thiophene (5a and 5c). Introduction of additional thiophene increases the electron richness of the π-linker conjugation in the dyes which enhances the transition probability of the π–π* and CT transitions.27 It is interesting to compare the absorption spectra of fluorenylidene based sensitizers 5a and 5b with the reference dyes D1 and D2. The absorption profiles of the dyes 5a and 5b are significantly broader than those of the control dyes D1 and D2 respectively as understood from the full-width at the half maxima estimated for the CT transition (Table 1). At the same time, a blue shift observed in the peak maxima supports the weak electron withdrawing nature of the fluorenylidene unit (vide supra). Overall, the increment in the molar extinction coefficient of the fluorenylidene derivatives when compared to the control dyes and 5e may be beneficial for photocurrent generation in DSSCs.

The nature of donor–acceptor interactions in these dyes is further ascertained by the closer examination of the absorption spectra of the dye precursors (Fig. S1 & S2, ESI†). The absorption spectra of the aldehyde derivative 2a showed two absorption bands at 339 nm and 374 nm assignable respectively to the π–π* transition localized within the diphenylaminofluorene unit, and a weak charge transfer transition due to amine and aldehyde interactions. Replacement of aldehyde (2a) with the fluorenylidene unit (3a) causes a nearly 40 nm red-shift. This strongly suggests a more effective delocalization of the nitrogen lone pair into the fluorenylidene units. Besides this evolution of donor–acceptor interaction is also evident on comparing the absorption spectra of aryl bromides 3, aryl aldehydes 4 and the final dyes 5. There is a progressive red-shift in the absorption profile reflecting the electron-withdrawing nature of aldehyde and cyanoacrylic acid units.
The absorption spectra of the dyes anchored on the surface of TiO2 (Fig. 3) exhibited the same trend in the longer wavelength tailing: D2 > D1 > 5b > 5a > 5e > 5d ∼ 5c. However, they are red shifted when compared to the solution spectra. This may be attributed to the large thickness of the TiO2 film28 or due to J-aggregation of the dye molecules.29
 Fig. 3  Absorption spectra of the dyes anchored on nanocrystalline TiO2. 
Since the photo-physical behaviour of dipolar compounds in solution highly depends upon solvent–solute interactions and solvent nature,30 the donor–acceptor interactions present in these dyes were further studied by measuring the absorption spectra in solvents of different polarity (Fig. 4 and Table S1, ESI†). All the dyes showed negative solvatochromism for the longer wavelength absorption band originating from the charge transfer transition. This suggests that the dye molecules are efficiently solvated in the ground state by the polar solvents. An unusual red-shift in absorption for dichloromethane may originate from the “instant” stabilization due to a rapid rearrangement of polarizable electrons during excitation.31 In contrast, the significant blue-shift and narrowing displayed by the DMF solutions of the dyes are caused by the deprotonation of the carboxylic acid unit. This will reduce the donor–acceptor interaction and in turn the transition probability of the charge-transfer transition. Existence of acid–base equilibrium in these dyes has also been confirmed by the addition of TFA or TEA to the DCM solutions of the dyes. A representative illustration is shown in Fig. 5 for the dye 5a. In DCM, the monofluorenylidene dyes (5a and 5b) exhibited a broad envelope arising from the overlap of two closely lying electronic transitions. On addition of TFA two distinct peaks are visible. But with TEA the partially overlapping peaks completely merge and lead to an intense absorption. This is likely to arise from the merger of the blue-shifted amine to cyanoacrylic acid charge transfer transition with the localized π–π* transition and amine to fluorenylidene CT.

 Fig. 5  Changes in the absorption spectra for the dye 5a on addition of TFA and TEA to the DCM solution. 
However, for the bis-fluorenylidene derivatives (5c and 5d) the absorption changes on interaction with TFA/TEA were minimal. They produced a red-side shoulder on addition of TFA while TEA narrowed the absorption band. This further supports the presence of weaker donor–acceptor interaction in these dyes. This is probably due to the two fluorenylidene units which competitively delocalize the nitrogen lone pair electrons and make them less available for donation.
It is interesting to compare the absorption properties of the dyes with those of the parent dye, (E)-2-cyano-3-{5-[7-(diphenylamino)-9,9-dihexyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl]thiophen-2-yl} acrylic acid (D1)32 possessing the diphenylaminofluorene donor, thiophene linker and cyanoacrylic acid acceptor. The absorption spectrum of the later dye (D1) is blue-shifted when compared to the analogous dyes 5a and 5c which reveals the beneficial role of fluorenylidene chromophores on the light-harvesting properties. The bis(fluorenylidene) derivative 5c displayed nearly a 1.5 fold intense absorption than that of D1. It is hypothesized that these properties will be beneficial for their photovoltaic properties.
Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of the dyes (Fig. 6 and Table 1) were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) in dichloromethane solutions containing 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium perchlorate as the electrolyte. All the dyes with the exception of 5e displayed a quasi-reversible oxidation couple (Fig. 6(a)) more positive than the ferrocene oxidation potential. The dye 5e underwent an irreversible oxidation (Fig. 6(b)) at 0.58 V vs. Fc/Fc+. Among the dyes, the dye 5e possessing the dicyanovinyl chromophore displays a more positive oxidation potential. A stronger electron withdrawing dicyanovinyl group significantly reduces the electron density on the arylamine unit than the fluorenylidene unit. Consequently, the amine in 5e is difficult to oxidize. There is no noticeable change in the oxidation potentials between the mono-fluorenylidene and bis-fluorenylidene derivatives. However, the bithiophene containing dyes (5b and 5d) showed low oxidation potentials when compared to the corresponding thiophene-based dyes (5a and 5c). The fluorenylidene-substituted dyes (5a–5d) showed an additional irreversible oxidation at high positive potentials, probably arising from the fluorenylthiophene conjugation segment. This second oxidation potential for the dyes follows the order: 5b < D2 < 5d < 5a < 5c. The oxidation is mainly governed by the electron-richness of the conjugation pathway and the number of fluorenylidene chromophores in the dye. The dye 5b which possesses a relatively electron-rich conjugation pathway, fluorenylbithiophene, and one fluorenylidene unit exhibited the lowest second oxidation potential while the dye, 5c, containing two fluorenylidene units and a fluorenylthiophene segment gave a high oxidation potential in the series.
 Fig. 6  Cyclic voltammograms of 5a–5d, D1–D2 and (b) DPV of 5a–5e, D1–D2 recorded in dichloromethane solutions. 
The excited state oxidation potential (E*ox) of the sensitizer is estimated by subtracting the 0–0 transition energy (E0–0) derived from the absorption edge of the dyes from the first oxidation potential (Eox). The alignment of ground and excited state oxidation potentials for the dyes with the conduction band edge of TiO2 and redox potential of the electrolyte is depicted in Fig. 7. The ground state oxidation potentials of the dyes fall in the range 1.14–1.35 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE).33 These values are more positive than those of the I−/I3− redox couple (∼0.4 V vs. NHE) and suggest the thermodynamically allowed regeneration of the oxidized dye by the electrolyte. The excited state oxidation potentials of the dyes (−0.83 to −1.02 V vs. NHE) are more negative than the conduction band of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE).34 Such a condition is required for the effective injection of electron from the photo-excited dye into the conduction band of TiO2.

Theoretical calculations
To understand the electronic structure of the dyes and the origin of the broad absorptions realized for the dyes, the geometry of the dyes was optimized by density functional theory (DFT)35 calculations with 6-31+G(D,P) basis sets and correlation functional B3LYP.36 The optimized geometries were used for the computation of vertical excitation energies using the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and the same basis sets. The computed energies of the vertical excitations and their orbital contributions are listed in Table S2, ESI.† The electronic distribution in the frontier molecular orbitals HOMO − 1, HOMO, LUMO and LUMO + 1 is shown in Fig. 8. Since the theoretically computed absorption wavelength deviated (>125 nm) from the observed values, the vertical excitations appearing below 425 nm are not considered for discussion here. The monofluorenylidene derivatives (5a and 5b) gave two prominent vertical excitations while the bis(fluorenylidene) dyes (5c and 5d) showed three electronic transitions for the longer wavelength absorption. The trends in the excitation energies are consistent with the solution spectral data. The longer wavelength absorption corresponds to the HOMO to LUMO vertical excitation in all the dyes. Since the HOMO of the dyes is mainly contributed by the diphenylaminofluorene segment and the LUMO spreads over the thiophene and cyanoacrylic acid, it is safe to assign this absorption originating from the charge transfer from the amine donor to the cyanoacrylic acid acceptor. The next longest wavelength absorption for the thiophene-linked dyes (5a, 5c, 5e, and D1) is due to the HOMO to LUMO + 1 electronic transition. Interestingly, the LUMO + 1 is localized over the peripheral fluorenylidene or dicyanovinyl units in the dyes 5a, 5c and 5e while in D1 it is spread over the fluorenyl–thiophene linker and the cyanoacrylic acid unit (Fig. S15, ESI†). So, this absorption can be attributed to the charge transfer from the amine donor to the auxiliary acceptors such as fluorenylidene or dicyanovinyl groups in 5a, 5c and 5e and amine to the cyanoacrylic acid acceptor in D1. For the bithiophene derivatives (5b and 5d), this absorption is composed of two vertical excitations. The lower energy side has contribution from HOMO − 1 to LUMO vertical excitation while the higher energy side originates from the HOMO to LUMO + 1 electronic excitation. The HOMO − 1 in these dyes is prominently located on the fluorene and bithiophene units. So, the second absorption under consideration for the bithiophene derivatives may be assigned as a mixture of π–π* and amine donor to fluorenylidene (5b and 5d) or cyanoacrylic acid (D2) CT transitions. On the basis of the theoretical predictions, the absorption in the visible region is presumed to result in migration of charge from the triarylamine to cyanoacrylic acid segment and to the auxiliary acceptor unit fluorenylidene or dicyanovinyl albeit in low proportion.
 Fig. 8  Electronic distribution in the frontier molecular orbitals of the dyes. 
There are some other interesting outcomes from the computational studies also. The electronic overlap between the ground (HOMO) and excited (LUMO) states for the fluorenylidene dyes (5a–5d) is less when compared to that of the dicyanovinyl analogue (5e). This suggests a favourable charge separation and hindrance for electron–hole recombination for the former dyes. Finally, the oscillator strengths of the CT transition of the dyes are also noteworthy. They are insensitive to the nature of the π-conjugation pathway present in the dyes but drastically influenced by the nature of the auxiliary acceptor. The dicyanovinyl dyes show intense CT absorption when compared to the fluorenylidene derivatives. However, the secondary absorption attributed to the amine to auxiliary acceptor CT possesses low transition probability for the dicyanovinyl dye. On comparing the excitation parameters for the fluorenylidene derivatives (5a–5d) the role of the linker in the secondary absorption is also evident. There is increment in the oscillator strength on moving from thiophene derivatives (5a and 5c) to the bithiophene analogues (5b and 5d). This is in agreement with the observed molar extinction coefficients for the dyes. Since the secondary absorption originating from the amine to auxiliary acceptor CT appears in the higher energy side, the auxiliary acceptors may serve as an antenna to absorb the light energy and transfer to the cyanoacrylic acid segment by a suitable energy transfer pathway.
Photovoltaic performance of the dyes
All the dyes were used as sensitizers for the fabrication of DSSCs using the conventional liquid electrolyte system. The performance parameters of the DSSCs are listed in Table 2. The I–V characteristics of the DSSCs measured under standard global AM 1.5G solar irradiation are presented in Fig. 9. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) as a function of wavelength is displayed in Fig. 10. Interestingly, the fluorenylidene derivatives (5a–5d) led to higher photocurrent density when compared to the dicyanovinyl derivatives (5e). Since the bithiophene derivatives (5b and 5d) exhibited broad and intense absorptions than the thiophene congeners (5a and 5c), higher photocurrent was expected for them. But the observation of similar photocurrent density for 5a–5d is intriguing. Since all these dyes possessed closely lying LUMO energies (Fig. 7), their electron injection rate might be equal. In contrast, a slightly small JSC observed for the dye 5e is attributed to the low lying excited state, which comparatively reduces the thermodynamic driving force for the injection of electrons into the conduction band of TiO2.37 Similarly the low VOC of 5e probably originates from the high lying HOMO level.38 Since this dye possesses relatively high lying HOMO in the series (Fig. 7), it is expected to experience difficulty in the regeneration of the dye from its oxidized form. Generally, faster regeneration of the dye will suppress the back electron transfer from TiO2 to the oxidized dye. Since the regeneration of 5e is hampered, it will increase the chance for a back electron reaction with the oxidized dye. Consequent reduction in the electron density is the reason for low VOC. Similar correlations between the HOMO energies of the dyes and VOC are well documented in the literature.39 Overall, the dye 5b exhibited slightly superior efficiency in the series which mainly originates from its incremental light harvesting propensity. The efficiencies of the present dyes are better than those reported for the dyes having the 4-tert-butylphenyl group18 in place of the fluorenylidene segment which establishes the beneficial role of the weak auxiliary acceptor in adjusting the HOMO and LUMO energies suitable for electron injection and dye regeneration.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
To further understand the photovoltaic performance of the dyes, the electrochemical impedance spectra were measured under 1 sun illumination and under forward bias in the dark. Fig. 11 shows Nyquist plots of the DSSCs. A typical Nyquist plot of DSSCs in the dark (Fig. 11(a)), displays three semicircles. The middle semicircle corresponds to the electron recombination at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. The radius of this semicircle is a measure of the charge recombination resistance. Smaller semicircles observed at lower and higher frequencies to this semicircle correspond to the electron transport in the TiO2 electrode and charge-transfer processes at the Pt/electrolyte interface respectively. A larger radius of the semicircle indicates larger resistance for the related process. The radii of the middle semicircle decrease in the order: N719 > D1 > 5c > 5b > D2 > 5d > 5a > 5e which suggests the highest recombination rate for 5e in the series (N719 < D1 < 5c < 5b < D2 < 5d < 5a < 5e). This clearly indicates that the fluorenylidene units are helpful for the suppression of dark current over the dicyanovinyl segment. However, the slightly increased recombination rate observed for the fluorenylidene dyes over the control dyes (D1 and D2) respectively may be attributed to the aggregation40 induced by the fluorenylidene unit or the dye–iodide complex formation.41 Also the low VOC observed for the monofluorenylidene derivatives 5a and 5c when compared to the control dye D1 is consistent with this observation. But the high VOC exhibited by the difluorenylidene derivatives (5b and 5d) than the control dye D2 is intriguing. The high VOC may also arise due to the large amount of electrons available in the conduction band of TiO2. This could result due to the better charge collection efficiency. In order to probe the relative charge collection rate in the devices, electrochemical impedance spectra were measured under illumination conditions. The radii of the intermediate frequency semicircle in the Nyquist plot (Fig. 11(b)) measured at standard illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G) conditions display relatively large semicircles for the dye 5e and the control dyes (D2 and D1) which indicate a large electron-transport resistance for their devices in the series (D2 > 5e > D1 > 5d > 5c > 5b > 5a). Low electron transport resistance observed for the fluorenylidene derivatives (5a–5d) suggests better electron collection efficiency over the other dyes. There exists a clear correlation between the device efficiency and electron transport resistance (Fig. 12). Dyes exhibiting comparatively high device efficiencies possessed low electron transport resistance. Also, due to their better electron collection efficiency they led to enhanced photocurrent. Thus the better performance of the fluorenylidene derivatives when compared to 5e and the control dyes may be ascribed to the improved electron collection facilitated by the favourable electron injection in the former dyes.

 Fig. 12  Correlation between the device efficiency and charge transport resistance. 
The middle frequency peak in the Bode phase plot (Fig. 13) related to the charge recombination rate and electron lifetime can be calculated by using τe = 1/ωmin.42 The electron lifetime data are consistent with the VOC values. The recombination of the injected electrons on TiO2 with the oxidized dye and/or electrolyte and the dye aggregation are the two processes that can play a vital role in determining the efficiency of DSSCs. But these processes are also controlled by the energy difference between the excited state of the dye and the conduction band of TiO2, the bonding between the dye and the semiconductor and the regeneration of dye by the redox electrolyte. It is already reported that the magnitude of the conduction band shift largely depends on the TiO2/dye interfacial dipole which in turn is affected by the electronic coupling between the dye and TiO2.43 High VOC and JSC observed for the DSSC based on 5b could be due to better electronic interaction between the dye and TiO2.

Conclusions
We have synthesized organic D–π–A sensitizers containing one or two fluorenylidene moieties in the triarylamine donor unit, cyanoacrylic acid as the acceptor/anchoring group, thiophene or bithiophene group as the conjugate bridge and applied to DSSCs. Additionally a sensitizer with a strong electron-accepting dicyanovinyl unit is also prepared. The absorption spectra of the fluorenylidene dyes 5a–5d showed relatively broad and high molar extinction coefficient absorption when compared to the dicyanovinyl derivatives 5e and the reference dyes D1 and D2. All the dyes showed negative solvatochromism for the longer wavelength absorption band originating from the charge transfer transition. On the basis of the theoretical predictions, the absorption in the visible region is presumed to result in migration of charge from the triarylamine to cyanoacrylic acid segment and to the auxiliary acceptor unit fluorenylidene or dicyanovinyl albeit in low proportion. The absorption spectra of the dyes 5a and 5c are red shifted when compared to the dye 5e possessing the dicyanovinyl unit, which indicates the beneficial role of fluorenylidene chromophores on the light-harvesting properties. The electrochemical properties of the dyes 5a–5d are found to be regulated by the electron-richness of the conjugation pathway and the number of fluorenylidene chromophores in the dye. The dye 5e possessing the dicyanovinyl chromophore displays more positive oxidation potential due to stronger electron withdrawing nature. When employed to DSSCs the fluorenylidene derivatives (5a–5d) led to higher photocurrent density and higher open circuit voltage when compared to the dicyanovinyl derivatives (5e). This is attributed to their high lying LUMO and low lying HOMO energies which enhances the electron injection into the conduction band and regeneration of the oxidized dye respectively. Our results indicate that the use of the fluorenylidene unit as a peripheral chromophore helps to enhance the light-harvesting capability of the sensitizers.
