    , Accepted 16th April 2014First published on 18th April 2014AbstractWe present a facile method for producing anti-fogging (AF) and anti-reflection (AR) coating functionalized photoanodes via one-step SiO2 nanoparticle coating for high performance solid state dye-sensitized solar cells (ssDSSCs). The AF and AR coating functionalized photoanodes are prepared by spin-coating of partially aggregated SiO2 colloidal solution. Poly((1-(4-ethenylphenyl)methyl)-3-butyl-imidazolium iodide) (PEBII), prepared via free radical polymerization, is used as a solid electrolyte in I2-free ssDSSCs. We systematically investigate the enhanced light harvesting characteristics of AF and AR coating functionalized photoanode-based ssDSSCs by measuring UV-visible spectroscopy, incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves under fogging conditions. Compared with conventional photoanode based ssDSSCs, the AF and AR coating functionalized photoanodes substantially suppress fogging and reduce reflection, leading to significantly enhanced light harvesting, especially under fogging conditions. ssDSSCs made of AF and AR coating functionalized photoanodes exhibit an improved photovoltaic efficiency of 6.0% and 5.9% under non-fogging and fogging conditions, respectively, and retain their device efficiencies for at least 20 days, which is a significant improvement of ssDSSCs with conventional photoanodes (4.7% and 1.9% under non-fogging and fogging conditions, respectively). We believe that AF and AR functionalization via one-step SiO2 colloidal coating is a promising method for enhancing light harvesting properties in various solar energy conversion applications.
1. Introduction
Due to their low cost and ease of preparation as well as significant potential for large area device fabrication, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have emerged as one of the most promising alternatives to conventional silicon based p–n junction solar cells.1,2 DSSCs are typically made by depositing a dye-sensitized wide band gap semiconductor on the surface of a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) substrate as the photoanode, a redox iodide/triiodide redox electrolyte couple and a Pt coated TCO substrate as the counter electrode. Upon light absorption by the sensitizer, photogenerated electrons are injected from the excited dye into the conduction band of a wide band gap semiconductor, and subsequently the injected electron diffuses through the TCO substrate, while the oxide dye sensitizer is regenerated via reduction of the iodide/triiodide electrolyte. The oxidized redox electrolyte couple is reduced at the Pt-coated counter electrode, completing the circuit to generate electricity from solar illumination. Recently, the drawbacks related to the use of liquid electrolytes such as leakage and evaporation have been addressed by the introduction of solid-state electrolytes based on polymers.3–6 In addition, numerous investigations have been carried out to develop novel materials such as photonic structures and anti-reflection coatings to enhance the light harvesting performance of solid-state DSSCs (ssDSSCs).7–20
Although it has not been addressed extensively, one mechanism that can substantially reduce the performance of various solar cells including DSSCs is the formation of fog on the surface of the device. Fogging on transparent surfaces such as TCO substrates occurs due to the condensation of water vapor from warm and humid air onto cool surfaces, leading to the formation of micron scale water droplets on the surface. Such water droplets on the surface of solar cells (e.g., DSSCs) would induce light scattering and significantly reduce the amount of photon that could reach the light absorbing components of the devices (e.g., sensitizer in DSSCs). Fogging especially can pose a serious problem in humid areas, especially during morning hours after a long night of solar cell inactivity. Interestingly, few studies have addressed this adverse effect of fogging on the solar cell performance.21 Although the Zou group reported an effective preparation route for the self-cleaning and anti-fogging coated layer based on superhydrophilic silica nanoparticles using a dip-coating method, the integration of such a coating into a solar cell design was not demonstrated.22
In this work, we report the enhancement of the DSSC performance under fogging conditions using anti-fogging (AF) coating-functionalized photoanodes. Recent studies have shown that nanoporosity-driven superhydrophilicity in nanostructure oxide materials leads to superhydrophilicity, which in turn imparts excellent anti-fogging properties to the surface. By inducing complete wetting of water on the surface, condensed water forms a thin sheet of water, rather than individual sessile droplets, reducing random scattering of light. We fabricate such a nanoporous coating by spin coating aged colloidal SiO2 nanoparticle suspension23 and test the improved efficiency of the DSSC under fogging conditions.
2. Results and discussion
Nanoporous SiO2 nanoparticle coatings on the non-conducting side of DSSC photoanodes are fabricated by spin coating an aged SiO2 solution (Scheme 1). The aged 22 nm SiO2 nanoparticle suspension is prepared by controlled aggregation under pH 7.0 at 60 °C for 2 hours. Aging colloidal SiO2 suspensions under these conditions activates the condensation reaction of surface silanol groups, which induces aggregation of SiO2 nanoparticles.23 A recent study has shown that SiO2 nanoparticle films generated from such an aged suspension are highly porous and have anti-reflection properties, which, in itself, would be beneficial for DSSCs.23 We adjust the spin coating conditions to generate an ∼110 nm thick SiO2 nanoparticle film, which forms a quarter wavelength single layer anti-reflection coating (see ESI†). Consistent with the previous study we confirm that SiO2 nanoparticle films deposited from the aged solution are thicker and more porous than those deposited from un-aged fresh SiO2 suspension (Fig. 1).24 These changes in the structure of the SiO2 nanoparticle film are believed to be due to the formation of nanoparticle aggregates upon aging.23 Also, no macroscopic cracks or other major imperfections are seen in the SiO2 nanoparticle films.

We first evaluate the wetting properties of the non-conducting side of un-treated and SiO2 nanoparticle-coated fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glasses. We note that all of the SiO2 nanoparticle coatings below are generated from the aged SiO2 suspension. Fogging on the FTO glasses is induced by exposing them to high humid environments after cooling them at a low temperature (<0 °C). The contact angle of a water droplet on the non-conducting side of the conventional photoanode without any treatment is 50°, whereas that on the non-conducting side of the SiO2 nanoparticle coated photoanode is only 3° as shown in Fig. 2 and summarized in Table 1. The superhydrophilicity of the aged SiO2 nanoparticle coating is due to the nanowicking of water into the network of the capillaries in the nanoparticle assembly, which induces complete sheeting of water.25,26 Therefore, these results strongly indicate that this one-step SiO2 colloidal coating could serve as highly effective anti-fogging (AF) coatings.

We test the effect of the SiO2 nanoparticle on the transmission of visible light under the fogging conditions. SiO2 nanoparticle-functionalized FTO glass (top) gives a much higher transmittance as compared to the reference FTO glass (bottom) under the fogging conditions, as shown in Fig. 3(a). These results indicate that a large area anti-fogging coating can be readily prepared on transparent surfaces such as FTO glass with a high degree of uniformity by spin coating of aged SiO2 nanoparticle suspensions. The high transmissivity of the SiO2 nanoparticle functionalized FTO glass is also confirmed by UV-Vis spectroscopy (Fig. 3(b)). It can be seen that fogging on the SiO2 nanoparticle-functionalized FTO glass is considerably suppressed over the entire visible range when compared to that on the conventional photoanode outer surface. We also confirm that the anti-reflection property of the SiO2 colloidal coating enhances the light transmission through the FTO glass under non-fogging conditions as shown in Fig. 3(c and d), which again will be beneficial for increasing the light harvesting of DSSCs.

(c) Photograph of a untreated FTO glass (bottom) and a SiO2 nanoparticle-coated FTO glass (top) under non-fogging; (d) transmittance spectra in the visible region for untreated and SiO2 nanoparticle-coated FTO glasses under non-fogging conditions, respectively. 
We fabricate and compare the performance of DSSCs with and without SiO2 nanoparticle coating on the non-conducting side of the photoanodes under fogging conditions, which is induced by breathing on the surface of DSSCs under humid conditions (>80% relative humidity). We fabricate ssDSSCs by using poly(1-((4-ethenylphenyl)methyl)-3-butyl-imidazolium iodide) (PEBII) as the solid electrolyte. As a reference point, ssDSSCs with SiO2 nanoparticle coatings have a conversion efficiency of 6.0% under the non-fogging conditions (see Fig. 6). Fogging on the control devices that are made of untreated photoanodes causes a significant performance degradation as seen in Fig. 4(a) and summarized in Table 2. A power conversion efficiency (η) of 1.9% is attained for the conventional photoanode based ssDSSCs with a Voc of 0.85 V, a Jsc of 4.1 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.55 due to the loss of light via scattering on the foggy FTO surface. In contrast, the AF and AR-coating functionalized photoanode-based ssDSSCs achieve a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 14.1 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.54, which results in an η of 5.9%. These values represent close to 220% and 210% enhancements in Jsc, and η as compared to the ssDSSCs without AF- and AR-coatings characterized under the fogging conditions. Interestingly, the Voc and FF of the ssDSSC remain almost unchanged under the fogging conditions for the AF and AR-coating functionalized photoanode-based ssDSSCs when compared to the conventional photoanode based ssDSSCs. These results indicate that SiO2 nanoparticle coating on the non-conducting side of the photoanode does not affect the internal electrochemical processes in the ssDSSCs such as recombination or electron back reaction at the electrolyte/electrode interface.24 Similar results were also observed for DSSCs modified with highly reflective counter electrodes, which were prepared through the deposition of alternating layers of organized mesoporous TiO2 and colloidal SiO2 nanoparticles on the non-conducting side of the counter electrode.27

The IPCE efficiency of the ssDSSCs with the SiO2 nanoparticle-coating functionalized photoanode is also considerably greater than those with un-treated photoanodes in the entire visible region as seen in Fig. 4(b). These improved Jsc values as well as the IPCE efficiency result from the enhanced transmittance and higher light harvesting characteristics of the photoanode under the fogging conditions.
The long-term performance of SiO2 nanoparticle coating in preventing fogging on ssDSSCs is tested by keeping the device in a dark condition and then measuring the device performance under fogging conditions every 24 hours as shown in Fig. 5. The superhydrophilicity of the nanoparticle coating is maintained at least for 20 days, and the device efficiency shows negligible reduction during such a period when tested under the fogging conditions.
 Fig. 5  Normalized cell efficiency of the ssDSSCs with SiO2 nanoparticle-functionalized photoanodes (40–50% relative humidity). 
In addition, to examine the effects of the one-step SiO2 colloidal coating on the light harvesting properties of ssDSSCs under non-fogging conditions, we fabricate ssDSSCs with untreated photoanodes and aged SiO2 nanoparticle deposited photoanodes and compare the photovoltaic parameters, i.e., open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and light to electricity conversion efficiency (η), as shown in Fig. 6(a) and Table 2 lists the photovoltaic parameters of these two ssDSSCs. Here, we note that the anti-reflection property of the SiO2 nanoparticle coating is also extremely beneficial for DSSCs because the coating significantly enhances the device efficiency under non-fogging conditions by suppressing the reflection at the non-conducting side of the photoanode. The η of the SiO2 nanoparticle-functionalized photoanode based ssDSSCs reaches 6.0% at 100 mW cm−2, which is a relatively high value among N719 sensitizer-based ssDSSCs28–33 and is 1.3-fold higher than the device efficiency of ssDSSC without AR- and AF-coatings. In particular, it can be seen that the Jsc in the AF and AR functionalized photoanode based ssDSSCs (13.3 mA cm−2) is considerably higher than that for the untreated photoanode system (10.2 mA cm−2) under the non-fogging conditions, whereas the Voc and FF are not affected by the one-step SiO2 colloidal coating layer, indicating enhanced light harvesting. IPCE measurements as a function of wavelength from 400 to 800 nm are also carried out under non-fogging conditions for ssDSSCs with and without SiO2 nanoparticle coatings, as shown in Fig. 6(b). The IPCE spectra under non-fogging conditions show that the ssDSSCs with nanoparticle coated photoanodes show a higher ηIPCE compared to the ssDSSC based on untreated photoanodes over the entire visible spectrum region. The enhancement of the ηIPCE for the SiO2 nanoparticle-functionalized photoanode based ssDSSCs results from the suppression of reflection and in turn increased transmittance of light through the TCO glass.

We also observe similar enhancement effects under the fogging and non-fogging conditions when liquid electrolytes are used for DSSC fabrication as shown in Fig. 7(a and b) and summarized in Table 3; that is, the application of the SiO2 nanoparticle film on the non-conducting side of the photoanode minimizes the performance degradation under the fogging and non-fogging conditions.

3. Conclusions
In summary, we have shown that fogging can significantly degrade the performance of a DSSC and that such a detrimental effect can be significantly eliminated by depositing superhydrophilic SiO2 nanoparticle coating on the non-conducting side of the DSSC photoanode. While the conversion efficiencies of DSSCs with untreated photoanodes under the fogging conditions are reduced by 47 and 60% for liquid and solid electrolyte-containing devices, respectively, the losses in the efficiency for devices with the nanoparticle coatings were less than 2 and 6%, respectively. In addition, these nanoparticle coatings impart anti-reflection properties to the TCO glass, increasing the light transmission and, in turn, enhancing the performance of the DSSCs under non-fogging conditions. We believe this one-step SiO2 colloidal coating approach is a simple, rapid and inexpensive process that can be widely used in a variety of photoelectrochemical devices to enhance the solar energy conversion.
4. Experimental section
Material
LUDOX TM-40 (40 wt% SiO2 suspension in H2O, 22 nm), titanium(IV) bis(ethyl acetoacetato) diisopropoxide, 1-butylimidazole, 4-chloromethylstyrene, lithium iodide (LiI), magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), 2,2′-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN), iodine (I2), 3-methoxypropionitrile, butylmethylimidazolium iodide, guanidinium thiocyanate, 4-tertbutylpyridine, valeronitrile, and chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO). 2-Propanol, chloroform, butanol, ethanol, diethylether and ethyl acetate were purchased from J. T. Baker. Deionized water (>18 MΩ m) was obtained with a water purification system made by Millipore Corporation. Ruthenium dye (535-bisTBA, N719), TiO2 colloidal paste (Ti-Nanoxide, D20), and 60 μm thick Surlyn were purchased from Solaronix, Switzerland. The fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass substrate (TEC8, 8 ohms per sq, 2.3 mm thick) was purchased from Pilkington, France. All chemicals and solvents reagents used in our experiments were obtained from commercial sources as guaranteed grade reagents and used without further purification.
Preparation of SiO2 colloidal solution for anti-fogging and anti-reflection coating-functionalized photoanodes (AF and AR-functionalized photoanodes)
SiO2 colloidal solutions were prepared by slightly modifying a previously reported method.23 For solutions that were aged, LUDOX TM-40 (40 wt% SiO2 suspension in H2O, 22 nm in size) was adjusted to pH 7.0 by using HCl and the solution was aged for 3 h at 60 °C. This process was required to reduce the negative surface charge on the SiO2 nanoparticles and produce particle aggregation through the condensation process of silanol groups (–OH) on the SiO2 nanoparticle surface. This solution was subsequently diluted to 5 wt% for spin coating.
Preparation of AF and AR-functionalized photoanodes
The transparent fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass substrate was employed in order to prepare the AF and AR-coating functionalized photoanodes. Before fabricating AF and AR coating onto the non-conducting side of the photoanode, the FTO glass substrates were rinsed with 2-propanol and chloroform each for 30 min and dried under nitrogen, respectively. Subsequently, a dense TiO2 film as a blocking layer on the conducting side of the FTO substrate was prepared by spin coating a titanium(IV) bis(ethyl acetoacetato)diisopropoxide solution (2 wt% in butanol) at 1500 rpm for 10 s, followed by calcination at 50 °C for 30 min and subsequently calcined at 450 °C for 30 min. Next, to prepare nanocrystalline TiO2 layers, we blade-coated the commercial TiO2 paste (commercially known as Ti-Nanoxide, D20) on top of the blocking layer on the conducting side of the FTO substrate. The FTO glass was subsequently heated to 450 °C for 30 min. And then, the as-prepared photoanode was sensitized with a 0.5 mM ruthenium complex, cis-diisothiocyanato-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II)bis(tetrabutylammonium), (commercially known as N719) in ethanol for 24 hours. The aged SiO2 colloidal solution was spin coated onto the non-conducting side of the photoanode at 2000 rpm and was dried at 70 °C for 30 min.
Fabrication of ssDSSCs and DSSCs
For fabrication of solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (ssDSSCs) and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), the polymerized ionic liquid (PIL) and liquid state electrolyte solution was dropped onto the photoanode and covered with the counter electrode, according to a previously reported procedure, respectively.34,35 For the ssDSSC system, a PIL, i.e., poly(1-((4-ethenylphenyl)methyl)-3-butyl-imidazolium iodide) (PEBII) electrolyte, was prepared by dissolving in acetonitrile. And then, the PIL electrolyte solution was allowed to infiltrate the photoanode. The photoanode was subsequently placed on top of the counter electrode. In the case of DSSCs, a liquid electrolyte, i.e., 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, iodine (I2), guanidinium thiocyanate, and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) solution was prepared by dissolving in acetonitrile and valeronitrile (v/v, 85:15). And then, DSSCs were filled with a liquid electrolyte solution through a drilled hole on the counter electrode. The gap between the two electrodes was maintained at 60 μm using a thick Surlyn tape.
Characterization
The surface morphology of SiO2 nanoparticle coated photoanodes were observed using a field emission-scanning electron microscope (SUPRA 55VP, Carl Zeiss). A tapping mode atomic force microscope (TM-AFM) (Nanoscope IV, Digital Instruments) was used to examine the topology of nanoparticle-coated FTO glasses. The thickness and refractive index of nanoparticle coatings were determined using a spectroscopic ellipsometer, Alpha-SE, and the Complete EASE software package (J. A. Woollam). Transmittance spectroscopy was measured with a spectrophotometer (Hewlett Packard) in the range 300 to 800 nm. The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured as a function of wavelength from 400 to 800 nm using a specially designed IPCE system for dye-sensitized solar cells (K3100). The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were measured using a Keithley 2400 source under illumination by using an AM1.5G A class solar simulator (ABET Technologies, model 11000) at 100 mW cm−2, referenced to a standard silicon cell. The UV-Vis absorption spectra were measured by using a JASCO 550A spectrometer. During photocurrent density–voltage measurement, the DSSCs were covered with a black mask with an aperture to avoid additional light coming through lateral space. The photoelectrochemical performances were calculated by the following equations. FF = Vmax × Jmax/Voc × Jsc(1) η = Vmax × Jmax/Pin × 100 = Voc × Jsc × FF/Pin × 100(2)where Jsc is a short-circuit current density (mA cm−2), Voc is an open-circuit voltage (V), Pin is an incident light power, FF is the fill factor, η is an overall energy conversion efficiency and Jmax (mA cm−2) and Vmax (V) are the current density and voltage in the J–V curve, respectively, at the point of maximum power output. The wettability of nanoparticle-coated FTO glasses was characterized by the measurement of water contact angles on their surfaces (FM 40, KRUSS Gmblt Germany). The volume of the distilled water droplet used for the contact angle determination was 10 μl.
