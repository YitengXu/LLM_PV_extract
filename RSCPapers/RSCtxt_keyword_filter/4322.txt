    , Accepted 23rd August 2011First published on 13th September 2011AbstractWe, for the first time, employed aqueous colloidal CuInS2 in quantum dot sensitized solar cells. With heat treatment and introduction of CdS buffer layer, a power conversion efficiency of 1.47% was achieved. The CuInS2 quantum dot made without using organic solvents offers facile fabrication and potential for further photovoltaic application.
Chalcopyrite light adsorption material CuInS2, with long-term stability and low toxicity, shows excellent photovoltaic performance in thin film solar cells.1 However, fabrication by magnetron sputtering in vacuum or a hydrazine based solution process are costly or highly toxic, hindering scale-up of production.2 Efforts to apply CuInS2 in other low-cost and environment-friendly devices have been launched in recent years.3,4 Of particular interest is the quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs), in which quantum dots (QDs) are focused on CdSe, CdS, CdTe, PbS, PbSe etc.5,6 However most of them are toxic or air-sensitive. Free of these weaknesses, CuInS2 QD is a proper light adsorption material for QDSSCs, and moreover, its energy band gap can be tuned by replacing sulfur (S) with selenium (Se).7 However, up to now, reports on successful CuInS2 based QDSSCs are quite rare. Teng et al. used CuInS2 coated with CdS as sensitizers on TiO2 electrode to fabricate photoelectrochemical cells, and saturated photocurrent density of 7.7 mA cm−2 was obtained at a bias potential higher than 0.2 V.4 Zn-doped CuInS2 QDs with ZnS core-shell structure sensitized ZnO nanotube QDSSC devices yielded an efficiency of 0.7%.8 In their work, CuInS2 QDs with long fat chains were synthesized in an organic solvent system. To sensitize the oil phobic TiO2 or ZnO, the organic ligands with long fat chains have to be removed or replaced, which was a rather demanding process with poor reproducibility. Although researchers had tried to employ CuInS2 synthesized in hydrophilic solvent in solar cells, their photovoltaic performances were seldom reported.9,10
Here we utilized the CuInS2 QDs synthesized in aqueous solution as the sensitizer for a TiO2 photoanode, active carbon coated fluorine doped SnO2 (FTO) conductive glass11,12 as the counter electrode and polysulfide aqueous solution as the electrolyte to fabricate the QDSSCs. The CuInS2 QDs synthesized in water without long fat chains of organic ligand is significantly easier and more controllable route to assemble the QDSSCs.
The CuInS2 QD colloid was prepared according to the literature13 with slight modification. In detail, 145 ml deionized water was aerated by N2 for 30 min to dispel air. 2 ml Cu(Ac)2 (0.125 M), 2 mL InCl3 (0.125 M) aqueous solution were mixed with the deaired water while stirring. 1 mL fresh mercapto acetic acid (MAA) aqueous solution, with MAA and water volume ratio equalling 1:5, was added. As the mixture turned clear, 1 mL Na2S (0.5 M) was injected quickly to form an orange colloid, which was finally concentrated to 20 ml via rotary evaporation. XRD patterns clearly presented the existence of CuInS2 and particle size was estimated 2–3 nm, shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). A TiO2 film with transparent layer of 9 μm thickness and scattering layer of 5 μm thickness was fabricated on FTO conductive glass following the literature.14,15 The acquired film was immersed in concentrated CuInS2 colloid for 12 h, and then washed with distilled water to remove excess QDs. The assembly of CuInS2 QDs on semiconductor surface is supposed to be interaction between the minus charged colloid particle (caused by carboxylate group ionization) and the naked surface mental cation.16,17
To obtain efficient CuInS2 QDSSCs, the photoanodes were thermally treated on a 280 °C heating platform in air. To further improve the performance, a CdS buffer layer by chemical bath deposition18 was introduced between TiO2 and CuInS2 layer. Before clamping the photoanode and carbon coated FTO counter electrode as a sandwich type for current–voltage (J–V) measurements, a glue tape piece of 45 μm thickness was inserted as the spacer with a rectangular hole in the middle, where polysulfide (1 M Na2S and 1 M S in aqueous solution) electrolyte was filled. J–V curves were recorded by a potentiostat (Princeton Applied Research, Model 263A) with the device under one-solar AM 1.5 irradiation of a simulator (Oriel, 91192) calibrated with a Si-based reference. A mask with a window area of 0.15 cm2 was clipped on the photoanode side to define the active area of the cell during each test. Measurements of incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) were made on a homemade IPCE setup illuminated under 0.01–0.09 mW cm−2 monochromic light.19 The optical absorptions were characterized by UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2550 SHIMADZU Japan). Morphology images and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy were obtained using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEI XL30 S-FEG).

Fig. 1 shows the influence of heat treatment on the CuInS2 sensitized photoanodes. A short circuit current density (Jsc) of 2.4 mAcm−2 was yielded after 30 s heat treatment (Fig. 1(a)). With increasing heating time, Jsc, open circuit voltage (Voc) and efficiency (Eff) of the device would firstly rise to the highest value at 80 s heating and then decrease. In order to understand the influence of heat treatment on photoanodes, UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded. It was found that as the heating time was prolonged, the light absorption onset shifted to longer wavelengths, corresponding to the color change of the photoanodes from orange to black in Fig. 1(c). Meanwhile, results from XRD measurements (see Fig. S1†) indicated that QD size increased as a function of heating time. Generally, enlargement of CuInS2 QDs can lead to decreased bandgap, therefore, light absorption onset shifts to longer wavelength, in agreement with the light absorption spectra. The increased light absorption could contribute to the improved photocurrent.

SEM images in Fig. 2 show the morphologies of a bare TiO2 film and CuInS2 absorbed TiO2 without and with heat treatment. The TiO2 nanoparticles after CuInS2 adsorption show slightly enlarged size with near round shape and clear boundary. After 80 s heat treatment, the morphology of the CuInS2/TiO2 becomes rougher. Though the specific reason is unclear, it is highly possible that a small amount of MAA would be removed20 and the interspaces between CuInS2 and TiO2 as well as among CuInS2 QDs shrunk after heat treatment.21 Therefore an enforced interface connection between CuInS2 and TiO2 and a relatively dense CuInS2 layer was formed, which is beneficial to photogenerated electron transport in QDSSCs.

Table 1 shows the composition of CuInS2 layer examined by EDX. For film without heat treatment, the ratio of Cu:In:S was 1:1.1:2.4 (in Fig. 2(d)). The deviation of sulfur (S) from standard chemical stoichiometry was caused by the thiol group of MAA on the CuInS2 QD surface. As heating time was prolonged, the composition of S declined gradually, which is due to the oxidation of S during heating in air. This is a possible reason for the compromised efficiency and the high light absorption beyond 800 nm for 120 s heated photoanodes and work is underway to solve this problem.

 Fig. 3  
J–V characteristics of devices with different sensitizer layers. Photoanodes were heat treated for a period of 80 s, except for CdS, as this heat treatment did not influence the CdS sensitizer. 
Though J–V measurements show that CuInS2 sensitized TiO2 after heating for 80 s yielded a Jsc of 4.44 mA cm−2, the Voc is rather low (Fig.1 (a)). Previous studies22,23 have revealed that in thin film solar cells direct junction between p-type photo absorption layer and n-type TiO2 or ZnO window layer will lead to unmatched band alignments; furthermore, a high surface state density will form between the chalcopyrite structured CuInS2 and anatase TiO2 or wurtzite ZnO. Therefore a buffer layer, such as CdS, ZnS or In2S3, is indispensible to tune the band alignment and improve the interface property. Here we deposited CdS for the same reason, and evidently other materials can be used to substitute the toxic CdS. Since CdS is also a QD sensitizer material, a device with only CdS buffer layer was first assembled for the control experiment. The data in Table 2 show that after 80 s heat treatment, the efficiency of the device with TiO2/CdS/CuInS2 as the electrode is twice the sum efficiency of the devices with TiO2/CuInS2 and TiO2/CdS as electrodes separately. In particular, Voc has a remarkable boost, implying the buffer layer performed more than a sensitizer role in generating photocurrent. A possible explanation is that CdS restrained the interfacial recombination,4 thus leading to increased Voc and then Eff.

To further investigate the role of CdS, IPCE measurements (Fig. 4) were carried out on the devices with CdS, CuInS2 and CdS/CuInS2 layers separately. The curve of the CdS sensitized device ends at ∼500 nm, whereas the one with CuInS2 layer extends to ∼750 nm. After the introduction of CdS layer, the IPCE was raised integrally, rather than confined in CdS light responsive range. Meanwhile, the inset figure shows that beyond the CdS light absorption range, the introduction of CdS made little difference to the light absorption intensity of CuInS2. It means that during the fabrication process, CdS did not bring more CuInS2 QDs deposition on TiO2 after equal time immersion in CuInS2 colloid. Therefore, except the contribution of CdS light absorption, the improved efficiency is supposed to be from restrained electron-hole recombination by introduction of CdS buffer layer. A further study of the kinetic processes in this new kind of QDSSCs is being carried out.

Photoanodes with CuInS2 or CdS/CuInS2 were heat treated for 80 s. The inset image is UV-Vis adsorption spectra of accordant sensitizer, which was measured without heat treatment. 
Conclusions
For the first time CuInS2 QD synthesized without using organic solvent was assembled in QDSSCs. Heat treatment significantly affected the performance of the CuInS2 sensitized photoanodes. IPCE data showed this CuInS2 layer can effectively generate photo-electron injection, especially with the assistance of a CdS buffer layer. With optimal time of heat treatment and CdS buffer layer, an Eff of 1.47%, with Jsc = 8.21 mA cm−2 and Voc = 489 mV was achieved. The proposed CuInS2 QDSSCs fabrication approach offers low-cost and facileness and the results provide evidence that this device can reach better photovoltaic performance.
