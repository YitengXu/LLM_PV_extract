    , Accepted 13th June 2017First published on 13th June 2017AbstractIn the past few years, hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much attention due to their excellent photovoltaic performance and extremely low fabrication costs. The power conversion efficiency (PCEs) of these PSCs has lepts from 3.8% to a verified PCE of 22.1% within just 7 years. However, the limited long-term stability of PSCs still restricts them from industrial applications, and furthermore, chemical decomposition in humid environments has been recognized as a main degradation pathway of perovskite materials. Although encapsulation techniques are usually used in the field of organic photovoltaics to slow down the degradation of organic materials, the key to resolving the degradation issues related to PSCs is to find stable perovskite materials or device architectures capable of achieving long-term stability. This review discusses the current popular strategies for enhancing the stability of PSCs, which are mostly, in general, concerned with modifying the properties of either the perovskite material itself or the charge transport layers. The stability of perovskite materials is usually optimized by compositional engineering with halides and cations. Meanwhile, on the other hand, incorporating inorganic charge transport layers or an interfacial moisture-resistant agent into PSCs are also considered as effective routes to sustain the device stability as well as to retain the performance of PSCs. This review systemically summarizes the recent efficient strategies for improving the long-term stability of PSC devices and provides useful suggestions for further developments in PSC stability.Faming LiFaming Li is currently a postdoctoral fellow at the School of Microelectronics and Solid State Electronics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC).

1. Introduction
The development of renewable energy sources and technologies has attracted much attention due to the continuous growth in energy demand and as a result of environmental pollution. Solar energy has been recognized as the most abundant of all natural energy resources that can provide over 10000 times the power required by the entire planet.1 Photovoltaic (PV) cells have been shown to be the most promising way to harness this energy owing to their ability to convert electromagnetic energy (i.e., ultraviolet, visible, and infrared light) directly into electrical power in the form of current and voltage through the absorption of sunlight. PV technology therefore has been the focus of much institutional and industrial research in the past few decades. Traditional crystalline silicon and thin film solar cells with high efficiency (i.e., GaAs, CuInGaSe2, and CdTe) have been utilized to date.2,3 On the other hand, other novel solar cells have also emerged, such as dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)4 and organic solar cells.5 However, none of the aforementioned solar cells is able to satisfy the prerequisites of high efficiency, low cost, and long lifetime simultaneously as required for industrial applications. Recently, a new type of solar cells based on an organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite structure ABX3 (usually A = CH3NH3 (MA) or NH2CHNH2 (FA); B = Pb or Sn; X = Cl, Br, I, or mixed halides) has been regarded as one of the most promising PV technologies due to the rapid increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) achievable and its extremely low fabrication costs.6–8 Recently, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved a verified PCE of 22.1% based on a single junction structure.2 Furthermore, the perovskite material has been demonstrated to possess superior optical and electronic properties ideally suited for photovoltaic devices, such as tunable bandgap,9 high absorption coefficient,10,11 relatively low exciton binding energy,12–17 high carrier mobility,18 long carrier diffusion lengths,19–21 and ambipolar charge transport.22,23
Despite PSCs having attained a high efficiency in a short period, such cells still face many obstacles before they can be utilized in industrial use, such as hysteresis,24,25 light soaking,26 the heavy metal lead,27–30 ionic migration,31–33 and long-term stability.34–37 In particular, such hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite materials are very susceptible to humid environments because of their chemical degradation.38 The hydroscopic nature of the organic ammonium precursors and the solubility of Pb salts in humid conditions are considered as the essential reasons for their degradation under moisture.39–41 Other factors, such as phase transition,18,42,43 thermal decomposition,44,45 light-induced trap state formation,46 and bias-induced ion migration,47 are also considered as the possible reasons for the degradation of perovskite films. As a result, the stability of PSCs has become a major shortcoming compared to other PV technologies. A number of recent reviews have summarized the degradation mechanism of the intrinsic and extrinsic stability of PSCs within different structures and materials and have provided some strategies for improving device stability.48–51 However, limited efforts have been focused singly on the efficient strategies for improving the moisture stability of PSCs. In this review, the degradation mechanism of PSCs in a humid environment will be analyzed first, namely in Section 2. The main strategies to improve the long-term stability are then discussed afterwards in Section 3, focusing on three key aspects: (1) improvement in the self-stability of perovskite materials via mixed-halide and cation doping, (2) exploration of moisture-resistant inorganic charge transport materials, (3) modification at the interfaces of PSCs.
2. Degeneration mechanisms of perovskite solar cells
PSCs, inspired by the concept of DSSCs, were initially proposed to operate in a manner analogous to DSSCs, but substituting the dye with the perovskite materials in the structure of ABX3 as the light absorber. This structure consists of a three-dimensional (3D) network of corner-sharing octahedra BX64−, and an organic cation A at the interstices in a 12-fold cuboctahedral coordination. B is typically located in the center of the octahedron. Among various perovskite materials, MAPbI3 has been most popularly used as the light absorbing material in PSCs and has shown great potential because of its ideal optical and electrical properties for PV devices. However, studies have also pointed out that the degradation of MAPbI3 under the influence of moisture is one of the major concerns for its application.52–55 The color of the MAPbI3 perovskite layer becomes yellow as a consequence of the decomposition of MAPbI3 into PbI2, CH3NH2, and HI, see eqn (1),35 and this process is primarily connected to the humid environment. MAPbI3(s) ↔ PbI2(s) + MAI(aq.) ↔ PbI2(s) + CH3NH2(aq.) + HI(aq.)(1)
Moreover, intermediate hydrated crystal phases could be formed when MAPbI3 is exposed to water vapor. Note that this process is reversible (refer to [eqn (2)]).40 4MAPbI3 + 4H2O ↔ 4[MAPbI3·H2O] ↔ MA4Pb6·2H2O + 3PbI2 + 2H2O(2)
To study the effect of moisture quantitatively, the relative humidity (RH) condition (20%, 50%, 80%, 98%) in an environmental chamber was controlled to monitor the degradation process of the MAPbI3 film.39 The results showed that its degradation started with the hydration of MAPbI3 (refer to [eqn (3)]):39 4CH3NH3PbI3 + 2H2O ↔ (CH3NH3)4PbI6·2H2O + 3PbI2(3)
In addition, water vapor has been proven experimentally as another considerable factor that influences the stability of perovskite materials through a variety of in situ characterization techniques.34,39,56,57 Theoretical studies have implied that the high polarity in H2O from the environment can change the structure of hybrid organic–inorganic PSCs.58,59 Besides, the stability of perovskite films can be also affected by oxygen, UV irradiation, and thermal heating, etc.35,36 Several reports have revealed that the MAPbI3 decomposed directly to PbI2 in the presence of both UV irradiation and air (containing moisture and oxygen).35,36,56 The degradation process under light coupled with moisture and oxygen can be interpreted as follows (refer to [eqn (4)–(7)]): (4) MAI(aq.) ↔ CH3NH2(aq.) + HI(aq.)(5) 4HI(aq.) + O2 ↔ 2I2(s) + H2O(6) (7)
Peng's group calculated the effective activation energy for the degradation of MAPbI3 in N2 as 120 K J mol−1, while the synergistic effect between oxygen and heat reduces the effective active energy of degradation to ∼50 K J mol−1.56 In addition to moisture, thermal effects also significantly degrade the PSCs. It has been observed that the decomposition of MAPbI3 occurs by the annealing of MAPbI3 over 85 °C.45,60 Among these different possible threats to the stability of PSCs, the degradation caused by moisture is believed to be the most fundamental one. In this review, the discussion mainly focuses on the most recent strategies that are effective to suppress the degradation of PSC devices caused by moisture.
3. Strategies to improve the long-term stability of PSCs
3.1 Stability of perovskite materials
As a light absorber, MAPbI3 has shown great potential in application in solar cells due to its high PCE and low costs. However, the long-term stability of PSCs remains the most critical issue before industrial application. In PSCs, the perovskite material, the selective contact layer, the interface, and the electrode are all considered to influence the stability. Section 3.1 summarizes the recent progress in the stability of perovskite materials through halide engineering,9,61,62 cation substitution, and doping,64–66etc.

3.1.1 Mixed-halide engineering. 
Modification of the halide composition of perovskite materials was reported to be an effective way to improve the optical and electronic properties of the materials.9,67–69 The record PSCs achieved so far are always assisted through the compositional engineering of perovskite materials, and indeed devices based on pure halide perovskite (e.g., MAPbI3) have never exceeded 20% PCE despite many attempts.6,65,70 The mixture of multiple halogen elements in organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite materials brings many positive effects,71 including an improvement in carrier transport,19,21,72 open circuit voltage,73,74 and the stability of PSCs.9 In particular, the stability of PSCs has been improved with replacement of the mixed halide. As a result, researchers have tried to stabilize the material by halide exchanging or mixing. For example, breakthrough work by Lee et al. reported that the stability of air-processed MAPbI3−xClx was significantly improved compared with air-processed MAPbI3.70 Noh and Jeon et al. demonstrated that the incorporation of Br into MAPbI3 can effectively enhance its stability performance.9,76 Zhu et al. employed a facile halide exchange route (Fig. 1a) to incorporate Br into MAPbI3 to form MAPbI3−xBrx (refer to the XRD patterns in Fig. 1b).63 The PSCs based on MAPbI3−xBrx yielded maximum PCE values of 14.25% and 93% of the original efficiency value retained after exposure to ambient air for 14 days without encapsulation (Fig. 1c). Moreover, it has been also confirmed that pure halide perovskite is unstable under UV irradiation or thermal heating due to its low crystallization energy.45,53,60

3.1.2 Cation substitution and doping. 
The stability of the perovskite film has been improved with incorporating mixed halides, but halide segregation still remains a problem for the long-term stability of the PSCs.46 As a result, cation substitution in PSCs was proposed as a further enhancement for improved device stability. For example, FAPbI3 has shown its potential for PV solar cell applications because of its extended absorption in the spectrum in comparison with MAPbI3.77–80 However, the FAPbI3 crystal has a larger tolerance factor, leading to a less stable crystal structure. A number of studies therefore have investigated the appropriate composition of MA+ and FA+ cations in the ABX3 perovskite materials to successfully improve the performance of PSCs.60,63,77–80
On the other hand, cesium-based metal-trihalide perovskite (CsBX3, X = Cl, Br, I) has attracted much attention because of its good stability.81–85 However, the bandgap of CsPbI3 (∼1.73 eV) is not ideal for light absorption. Hence, Cs+ has been incorporated with other perovskite materials to achieve more stable PSCs with high efficiency. Studies in the literature have systematically investigated the various combinations of possible cations, such as Cs/MA, Cs/FA, and Cs/MA/FA.65,66,75,86 Li et al. theoretically showed the improvement in stability of the alloys FA1−xCsxPbI3 by using first-principles calculations.75 Further, the stability of FA0.85Cs0.15PbI3 was studied experimentally and the XRD patterns showed a negligible difference of FA0.85Cs0.15PbI3 in air after 30 days (Fig. 2a). Also no obvious color change was observed when the FA0.85Cs0.15PbI3 film was exposed at 90% relative humidity (RH) for 4 h (Fig. 2c). Under the same conditions to compare with the FAPbI3 film, the PbI2 peak was clearly observed in the XRD pattern (Fig. 2b), and the color of the FAPbI3 film changed to yellow (Fig. 2c). These results confirmed that Cs doping in the FA1−xCsxPbI3 perovskite material could significantly improve the humidity stability. Further, Saliba et al. expanded on the cations compositions from binary to ternary mixtures,65 and achieved a PCE of 21.17% based on the use of triple different cations (Cs/MA/FA) in the perovskite absorber (Fig. 2d). More importantly, this kind of perovskite was shown to be stable for at least 250 h under a nitrogen atmosphere (room temperature, constant illumination), as shown in Fig. 2e. The further incorporation of rubidium ions (Rb+) with the Cs/MA/FA cations generated a record stabilized output of up to 21.6%.64 Such a device maintained 95% of the initial PCE at 85 °C for 500 h under continuous full sun illumination (the maximum power point tracking in a nitrogen atmosphere).

3.2 Inorganic charge transport material
In general, PSCs are composed of a perovskite layer, charge transport layers, and electrodes107–109 (Fig. 3a). In addition to the stability of perovskite materials, investigations into the stability of the charge transport layers in the PSCs have also been necessary. There are two types of charge transport layers, i.e., the electron transport layer (ETL) and the hole transport layer (HTL) in PSCs. The configurations of PSCs in the literature mainly contain regular (n–i–p) and inverted (p–i–n) structures. The HTL and ETL used in PSCs are usually organic materials to achieve a high PCE. In a regular structure, for instance, the organic material 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) is widely used as the HTL in PSCs, and indeed was first used in DSSCs. On the other hand, in an inverted structure, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) are used as charge transport materials to extract the dissociated hole–electron pairs from the absorber layer.117,118 However, the organic layers are susceptible to degrade under moisture conditions due to their acidic and hydroscopic nature.88,110,112,119 Consequently, the degradation of organic layers accelerates the decomposition of the perovskite layer into PbX2, thus resulting in degradation of the PSC.42 Apart from that, organic transport layers such as PEDOT:PSS in fact can react with moisture and oxygen, resulting in altering of the microstructure and reduction of the conductivity in PEDOT:PSS.119 Inspired by inorganic materials for highly stable solar cells, the replacement of organic charge transport layers to inorganic materials is expected to improve stability in the PSCs. In Fig. 3c, a planar heterojunction structure of PSCs with an inorganic HTL and ETL is displayed.

3.2.1 PSCs with inverted structures. 
On the other hand, inorganic materials have also shown their capability as moisture-resistant materials.110–112,120 Compared with organic materials such as PEDOT:PSS, inorganic HTMs have been introduced in inverted PSCs due to their high hole mobility as well as excellent stability, including NiOx,87,88,117,121–123 CuI,90,124 graphene oxide(GO),91 reduced graphene oxide (RGO),92 CuOx,96 Cu2O,93,94 CoOx,97 CuSCN,95,125–127 NiOx/CuSCN complex,128 and CuO/Cu2O complex.129,130 The optimal PCE and their stability are shown in Table 1. On the other hand, inorganic ETLs also play an important role in the improvement of stability. For example, ZnO ETL was used to replace organic ETL (i.e., PCBM) in the inverted PSCs98 due to its good energy alignment with the perovskite absorbing layer. More importantly, it has a higher electron mobility compared with TiO2 ETL.105,106 Moreover, it is possible to synthesize high-quality ZnO nanoparticles at room temperature (RT), enabling the fabrication of thermal sensitive materials or flexible substrates.98 You et al. were the firsts to realize high-efficiency inverted PSCs employing inorganic ETL and HTL in the device simultaneously110 (Fig. 4a and a′). Such a PSC retained about 90% of the original PCE after keeping in air at RT for 60 days (Fig. 4a′′). Chen et al. reported a stable PSC using NiMgLiO HTL and Ti(Nb)Ox ETL with a high PCE, see Fig. 4b and b′.111 The results showed more than 90% remaining from the initial PCE after 1000 h of light soaking (Fig. 4b′′).111 It has been also shown that NiOx HTL combined with a SnO2 nanocrystal ETL yielded a PCE of 18.8% (Fig. 4c–c′). In Fig. 4c′′, the stability results showed that 90% of its initial PCE remained in ambient atmosphere with 75 ± 5% RH after 30 days.112 As a result, it was concluded that inorganic charge transport materials are able to significantly improve the moisture stability of PSCs while maintaining a high efficiency.

3.2.2 PSCs with a regular structure. 
In a regular structure, TiO2 and spiro-OMeTAD are the most common materials considered in PSCs as the ETL and HTL respectively.107,108,131 As a metal oxide semiconductor, TiO2 is frequently used as the ETL in PSCs because of its favorable energy level for electron extraction as well as for injection.132 However, the high trapping density below its conduction band of TiO2 brings many negative effects for perovskite devices, including their long-term stability. Under UV light irradiation, TiO2 becomes unstable due to its photocatalytic properties.133 Therefore, other inorganic metal oxide semiconductors have been widely explored to replace TiO2 ETL to sustain a good stability, while maintaining a good match of energy levels and a compatible charge mobility to TiO2. Such metal oxide semiconductors include ZnO,98,135–137 SnO2,99,138–140 In2O3,100 WOx,101,141,142 W(Nb)Ox,102 CeOx,103 Nb2O5,104 and Zn2SnO4.105 In particular, SnO2 has been shown as a promising candidate for the electron selective contact layer with a high PCE138,140,143 due to its impressive optoelectronic properties, such as high electron mobility, good conduction band alignment, and less charge carrier recombination centers.132,140,144 By replacing TiO2 with SnO2 in the PSCs, the hysteresis in the J–V measurements were significantly reduced (Fig. 5a, c and d).99 In terms of stability, SnO2 as the ETL showed better performance than TiO2. In Fig. 5b, the PSC with SnO2 ETL presents almost no difference in transient photocurrent under a continuous application of bias voltage (corresponding to the maximum power), while the transient photocurrent produced by the PSC with TiO2 ETL significantly drops. Meanwhile, the PCE of the PSC based on SnO2 ETL remained constant even after aging it for 30 days in dry air, see Fig. 5f.

Furthermore, novel inorganic materials for HTL have been also explored for PSCs in regular structures. Zhang et al. presented an improved stability for the PSCs using CuGaO2 and TiO2 as the HTL and ETL, respectively (refer to Fig. 6a).134 After 30 days in the ambient atmosphere (25 °C and 30–55% RH) without encapsulation, the PCEs of such devices retained more than 85% of the initial PCE value, see Fig. 6(a′). At the same time, Seok et al.114 demonstrated that the PSC with CuSCN and TiO2 layers maintained 60% of the initial PCE value after thermal annealing in air for 2 h at elevated temperature of 125 °C with 40% RH, whereas, the PCE of the spiro-OMeTAD device decreased lower than 25% after the same period, see Fig. 6b′. As a result, inorganic charge transport materials can effectively maintain the high PCE performance for PSCs, and they can also significantly enhance their long-term stability, see Table 2.

3.3 Moisture-resistant construction via interface engineering
Interface engineering has been recognized as another effective approach to realize the long-term stability of PSCs.1,37,155 For example, an additional layer was inserted between the perovskite layer and charge transport layers, preventing undesirable chemical reactions and meanwhile keeping the capacity of carrier transport at the interface.156

3.3.1 Waterproofing tunneling layer. 
In principle, the additional layers must be able to select to transport electrons for the ETL or holes for the HTL at the interface. As listed in Table 3, many inorganic materials are considered for interfacial engineering in PSCs. For example, Niu et al. added an ultrathin Al2O3 layer on top of the perovskite35 and successfully prolonged the lifetime of the PSCs,58 while a similar effect was observed by Dong et al. when the same layer was applied on top of the HTL.58 In both of the devices, the PCE remained at 90% of its initial value after storage in air for 24 days.58 Moreover, polymers were also selected as insulating tunneling materials, which was inspired from the applications of tunneling contacts in silicon solar cells. Wang et al. verified that cross-linking processed fluoro-silane as the tunneling layer on top of the perovskite film was able to reduce the carrier recombination at the interface, as well as protect the perovskite film from moisture.145 Furthermore, PSCs with a hydrophobic contact layer retained the same color after emerging the device in water for 3 min (Fig. 7b); whereas, it degraded to yellow immediately in water without the protection layer (Fig. 7c). Impressively, it still yielded a high Voc of 1.089 V even after 3 min in water (Fig. 7d), which was attributed to the waterproofing via Si–O–Si bonds from the fluoro-silane (Fig. 7a).

3.3.2 Interface insertion layer using low dimensional perovskite. 
A quasi-2D perovskite PEA2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (PEA = C6H5(CH2)2NH3+, MA = CH3NH3+) has been considered as another effective approach to improve stability of the device while keeping a high PCE (Fig. 8).157 By applying density function theory (DFT), strong van der Waals interactions were observed due to the incorporation of phenylethylammonium (PEA) into the perovskite layers, leading to an increase in formation energy. This theoretical analysis was consistent with the experimental results and explains the improvement in stability of the material.157 Later, 0D and 2D (or quasi-2D) perovskite materials were utilized as interfacial layers to improve the stability in PSCs.27,63,127,147,148 For example, Smith et al. found that the 2D hybrid (PEA)2(MA)2[Pb3I10] is a promising light absorbing material.27 Ma et al. demonstrated the 2D-CA2PbI4/MAPbIxCl3−x PSC, by depositing an ultrathin layer (2D perovskite CA2PbI4) on top of the MAPbIxCl3−x, which then remained stable for 40 days and retained 54% of the original PCE at 63% RH after 220 h.148 Yao et al. applied in situ polyethyleniminehydriodide (PEI·HI) during the deposition processing of the perovskite precursors to form the 2D perovskites ((PEI)2[PbI4]).147 This upgraded 2D perovskite material also helped protect the PEDOT:PSS against moisture. Most recently, 0D perovskite materials, such as MAPbBr3−xIx quantum dots, used at the interfaces of PSCs have attracted more attention.158 In short, perovskite materials in low dimensions provide an alternative route to resolve the stability issues of PSCs.

3.3.3 Cross-linking and surface passivation. 
In chemistry, cross-linking refers to linking molecular chains by chemical bonds under the effects of cross-linking media, such as light, heat, mechanical force, etc. In the field of organic photovoltaic (OPV) technologies, cross-linking can passivate the interfacial surfaces of devices and thus improve film morphology as well as the stability of these devices.159 Inspired by OPV technologies, the stability performance of the PSCs has been greatly improved via interfacial cross-linking.149–154,160 By applying alkylphosphonic acid ω-ammonium chlorides (ABPA) to cross-link the perovskite layer, it improved both the moisture tolerance and the thermal stability of perovskite films.150 Yang et al. also reported that cross-linking the hydrophobic tetra-ethyl ammonium (TEA) to the perovskite material surface formed an efficient moisture-resistant layer. The PSC based on such a cross-linked film yielded a PCE of over 15% and adapted to a humid environment (90% RH) for over 30 days.152 Another remarkable work achieved a PCE of more than 19% with good long-term stability by applying phenylalkylamine (PA) to passivate the perovskite layer.149 Zhao et al. compared three similar benzene-amine molecules, i.e., aniline (A), benzylamine (BA), and phenethylamine (PA), see Fig. 9a, to passivate the surface of FAPbI3 perovskite film. The results showed that the BA-treated FAPbI3 PSCs gave PCEs over 19% and more importantly retained the same performance for over 3000 h under about 50% RH, as shown in Fig. 9b and c.149

4. Conclusions and outlook
Over the past few years, scientists have been dedicated to satisfying the prerequisites of high efficiency, low costs, and long lifetime simultaneously of PSCs. In particular, it is more favorable to develop PSCs than other types of solar cells based on Si or III–V materials due to their lower production costs. However, the long-term stability still remains an important issue before they are ready for manufacturing on a large scale. In this review, we summarized the current main strategies in the field of PSCs to improve their stability regarding moisture, including mixed-halide engineering, cation substitution, doping, and the adoption of additional layers, such as inorganic charge transport layers or moisture-resistant interfacial materials. In addition, it has also been shown that the incorporation of inorganic perovskite materials and low dimensional perovskite into conventional perovskite-based devices can extensively enhance the overall stability of the PSCs, but their PCEs have to be further enhanced before application. Apart from considering the stability with moisture, other factors, such as UV irradiation or thermal heating, should also not be ignored in terms of their impact on the long-term stability of the PSCs. The failure through UV irradiation can be overcome by photon down-conversion using fluoropolymers materials for UV light filtering, while the thermal stability possibly can be improved by adding graphene oxide in the perovskite thin films or by inserting a graphene layer at the interface of the PSCs, because of the good thermal conductivity of graphene. Although there are some obstacles in stability to be addressed before commercial application, these effective strategies provide a fundamental understanding and some insights needed for stability enhancement. More effective strategies will be further explored and become more mature with a deeper understanding of perovskite material and device configuration. Therefore, PSCs with high efficiency and long-term stability are expected to be realized for practical application in the near future.
