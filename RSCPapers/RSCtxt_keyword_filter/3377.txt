The DSSC with CSG CE exhibits comparable efficiency to the cell with the Pt CE.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), as one of the most promising alternatives for traditional silicon solar cells, have inspired many fascinating studies in the past two decades.1–3 A typical DSSC includes a photoanode composed of a semiconductor oxide sensitized by dye molecules, an electrolyte with a I−/I3− redox couple, and a counter electrode (CE), which catalyzes the reduction of I3− to I−. As an important component in determining cell performance, an ideal CE should have a high electrocatalytic activity towards the reduction of I3−.4 Pt counter electrodes are commonly used for I−/I3− based DSSCs due to their high electrocatalytic activity. However, Pt is an expensive metal and is rare on the earth, so searching for alternative CEs for the reduction of I3− in DSSCs is highly desirable. To date, several functional materials have been applied as CEs in DSSCs, such as carbon materials,5,6 conductive polymers,7,8 as well as inorganic compounds.9–12
Graphene, composed of one-atom-thick planar sheets of sp2-bonded carbon atoms with a two-dimensional honeycomb structure,13 possesses a high surface area for the dispersion of nanoparticles and good electrical conductivity for electron transfer.14,15 Despite these advantages, the perfect graphene has been demonstrated to have low electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction.16–18 Recent research reveals that some oxygen-containing functional groups in the graphene skeleton may be responsible for improving its catalytic activity.19 In recent years, the cobalt sulfide has shown outstanding electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction when it was used as an alternative counter electrode material for DSSCs.9,20–22 However, its relatively low conductivity hinders the improvement of the photovoltaic performance. Therefore, combining high catalytic cobalt sulfide nanoparticles with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) that provides some oxygen-containing functional groups and possesses good conductivity is more advantageous for low cost CE applications in DSSC. Several routes have been developed for the fabrication of such composites, including the hydrothermal route,23,24 electrophoretic deposition,25 chemical vapor deposition.26 In a word, the main routes commonly used for the preparation of the above materials either involved complicated processes or often suffered from poor manipulation of the nanocomposite. Therefore, it is highly desired to develop a facile and general approach for the synthesis of graphene-based CEs with an excellent performance for DSSCs.
Herein, we combine the layer by layer assembly (LBL) method and thermal treatment to prepare the CoS2–RGO composite (CSG) films on the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate. The RGO and CoS2 nanoparticles can be obtained in one step via the thermal treatment process. This method not only affords thin and homogeneous graphene-based composite films but also avoids the agglomeration of CoS2 nanoparticle after thermal treatment. The obtained CSG CE is transparent and thin, and therefore, it is suitable for the application in plastic and tandem DSSCs.
In a typical synthetic route (see the ESI† for details), graphene oxide (GO) sheets were first deposited on the surface of FTO glass via a facile LBL method (Fig. 1(a)). The GO films were then coated with cobalt disulfide precursor solution and annealed in an Ar2 atmosphere at the temperature of 400 °C to obtain the CSG film (Fig. 1(b)). The CSG film exhibited excellent catalytic performance with the deposition cycle number of 6.
 Fig. 1  Preparation process of the CSG counter electrode. 
The XRD pattern of the CSG film is presented in Fig. 2(a). The phases were identified as CoS2 (JCPDS no. 65-3322) and RGO,27 respectively. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis of the CSG film (Fig. 2(b)) reveals the presence of Co and S elements, and the average atomic ratio of Co to S is estimated to be 1:2, which is close to the atomic ratio of the CoS2 phase. In order to elucidate the GO film characteristics, we carry out the UV-vis absorption measurement. As shown in Fig. 2(c), a stepwise increase in absorbance was observed, indicating a regular growth of the GO film using the LBL process. As evidenced in the AFM image (Fig. 2(d)), the thickness of a monolayer graphene oxide used in the LBL process is about 2.15 nm, indicating that the CE is thin.

The inset in (c) shows the plot of the absorbance at 382 nm vs. the number of deposition cycle. (d) AFM image of the monolayer GO film. 

Fig. 3(a) displays the surface morphology of pristine FTO. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the GO mantles the FTO surface where its morphology can be clearly observed, indicating that the GO film is thin and transparent, this is advantageous for providing a large actual surface to contact the electrolyte and indicating a promising application as window electrodes in solid-state DSSCs.28 As depicted in Fig. 3(c), the TEM image confirms that the CoS2 nanoparticles anchor on the surface of RGO with a particle size of 10–50 nm. This can be ascribed to the binding effect of the oxygen-containing functional groups of RGO. The agglomeration of CoS2 nanoparticles at high temperature was effectively inhibited by the binding effect of the oxygen-containing functional groups. The SEM image of the Pt electrode is shown in Fig. 3(d), tiny Pt nanoparticles were observed after thermal treatment, and a porous structure was formed, simultaneously.
 Fig. 3  (a), (b) and (d) is the SEM images of the FTO, FTO/GO and FTO/Pt, respectively. (c) is the TEM image of CSG. 
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were investigated by using symmetrical dummy cells to exclude the influence of the photoanode. Fig. 4(a) shows the Nyquist plots obtained for the CSG and Pt electrodes at room temperature in the I−/I3− electrolyte system. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the intercept of the semicircle on the real axis is assigned to the ohmic series resistance (Rs), which describes mainly the resistance of the substrates.29 The semicircle in the left of the Nyquist plot is attributed to the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) and the corresponding capacitance (C) at the electrode–electrolyte interface. The information regarding the Nernst diffusion impedance (Zn) of the redox couple in the electrolyte can be obtained from the semicircle on the right.30 The parameters obtained by fitting an equivalent circuit for the Nyquist plots are tabulated in Table S3 (see the ESI† for details). The Rs of the Pt film is 20.7 Ω which is closer to the Rs of the CSG film (22.5 Ω), suggesting that the adhesion between the CSG film and the FTO substrate is remarkable.31 The Rct of CSG CE is 4.8 Ω, which is a little higher than that of the Pt film (3.4 Ω), indicating a superior catalytic performance of CSG CE toward the reduction of I3−.32 It is attributed to the synergistic catalytic effect between CoS2 nanoparticles and RGO. The Zn value for Pt CE is 1.90 Ω, which is lower than that of the CSG CE (5.7 Ω). The different surface morphologies may be the reason for the different Zn values of CSG and Pt electrodes.33 As shown in Fig. 3(d), the porous structure of the Pt electrode is beneficial for the diffusion of the electrolyte.
 Fig. 4  (a) Nyquist plots and (b) Tafel polarization curves for the symmetric cells fabricated with Pt and CSG CEs. 
To further evaluate the properties of CEs, Tafel polarization curves were also measured for the symmetrical cells with Pt and CSG CEs. The information regarding the exchange current density (J0) and the limiting diffusion current density (Jlim) related to the electrocatalytic activity of the CEs can be obtained from the curves. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the J0 of CSG CE is slightly lower than that of the Pt CE, indicating that the CSG and Pt CEs have similar electrocatalytic activities. In theory, J0 varies inversely with Rct according to the equation: J0 = RT/nFRct,22 where R is the gas constant, T is the Kelvin temperature, F is Faraday’s constant, n is the electron number involved in the reaction, and Rct is the charge transfer resistance. The variation of J0 obtained from Tafel curves is in agreement with the change tendency of Rct derived from the EIS spectra. Furthermore, the Jlim can be obtained from the current density at low slope and high potential regions, which are determined by the diffusion of the ionic carriers from one electrode to the other electrode. We can deduce the relationship between the diffusion coefficient (D) and Jlim according to the equation: D = Jliml/2nFc where l is the spacer thickness, c is the concentration of I3−.9 As the value of Jlim increases in the order of Pt > CSG and is directly proportional to the value of D, the latter should vary in the order of Pt > CSG, which is consistent with the EIS analysis about Zn. Consequently, we conclude from the EIS and Tafel polarization measurements that the CSG CE has a Pt-like electrocatalytic activity to catalyze the I3− reduction.
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the cell are displayed in Fig. 5 and the corresponding photovoltaic performance parameters are summarized in Table 1. As depicted in Fig. 5, the DSSC using CSG CE (PCE = 5.43%) performs almost as well as the DSSC using the Pt counter electrode (PCE = 5.84%). This result is in agreement with the EIS and Tafel analysis results. Compared to the device with the Pt CE, the lower FF of the CSG based cell is the main reason for a lower PCE, this can be attributed to the low conductivity of CoS2 nanoparticles. According to the previous report,28 the excellent performance for CSG CE is attributed to both the improved catalytic activity by incorporation of CoS2 nanoparticles and the electronic coupling between CoS2 and RGO, which forms an additional conducting pathway and accelerates the electron transfer from the CE to the electrolyte.

The CoS2–RGO composite material is successfully synthesized via the LBL method combined with thermal decomposition process. The LBL method can not only control the thickness of GO film effectively, but also avoid using the organic binder in the preparation of the electrode. This process facilitates the in situ generation of CoS2 nanoparticles and the reduction of graphene oxide in one step, thus reducing the manufacturing cost and saving time. In the CSG composite system, the high surface area of the RGO scaffold can load more CoS2 nanoparticles and the synergetic effects between the CoS2 nanoparticle and RGO also contribute to the high electrocatalytic activity. When the CSG thin film is used as the counter electrode, the DSSC exhibits an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.43%, which is comparable to the PCE of the cell with the Pt electrode (5.84%). It is expected that this simple and low cost method can be extended for fabricating other composite thin films.
