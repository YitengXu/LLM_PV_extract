    , Accepted 22nd February 2017First published on 22nd February 2017AbstractAs the world economy grows and industrialization of the developing countries increases, the demand for energy continues to rise. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have been touted as having great potential for low-carbon, non-fossil fuel energy generation. Mechanical energies from, amongst others, body motion, vibration, wind and waves are captured and converted by TENGs to harvest electricity, thereby minimizing global fossil fuel consumption. However, only by ascertaining performance efficiency along with low material and manufacturing costs as well as a favorable environmental profile in comparison with other energy harvesting technologies, can the true potential of TENGs be established. This paper presents a detailed techno-economic lifecycle assessment of two representative examples of TENG modules, one with a high performance efficiency (Module A) and the other with a lower efficiency (Module B) both fabricated using low-cost materials. The results are discussed across a number of sustainability metrics in the context of other energy harvesting technologies, notably photovoltaics. Module A possesses a better environmental profile, lower cost of production, lower CO2 emissions and shorter energy payback period (EPBP) compared to Module B. However, the environmental profile of Module B is slightly degraded due to the higher content of acrylic in its architecture and higher electrical energy consumption during fabrication. The end of life scenario of acrylic is environmentally viable given its recyclability and reuse potential and it does not generate toxic gases that are harmful to humans and the environment during combustion processes due to its stability during exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Despite the adoption of a less optimum laboratory manufacturing route, TENG modules generally have a better environmental profile than commercialized Si based and organic solar cells, but Module B has a slightly higher energy payback period than PV technology based on perovskite-structured methyl ammonium lead iodide. Overall, we recommend that future research into TENGs should focus on improving system performance, material optimization and more importantly improving their lifespan to realize their full potential.

Broader context
The ability of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) to convert mechanical energy from various sources into useful electrical energy has drawn attention in recent years. Given their potential for low cost energy generation for self-powered applications, it is important to assess their environmental profile and cost viability by carrying out a detailed techno-economic lifecycle assessment. This will provide an indication as to whether they constitute new environmental challenges or not. In this paper, a robust environmental life cycle assessment within a techno-economic framework is carried out for two TENG modules in the context of other energy harvesting technologies. 11 lifecycle environmental metrics as well as the energy payback periods and carbon dioxide emission factors are determined. Although the environmental impact of both modules is lower compared to traditional PV technologies, the higher quantities of acrylic in one of the modules along with energy-intensive fabrication led to a slightly higher environmental burden. Material optimization focusing on reduced material utilization as well as better fabrication processes should, however, improve their environmental profile. Uncertainty sensitivity analysis is conducted to provide deeper insights into TENGs. The current work therefore lays the foundation for future investigations into the profile of TENGs for environmentally friendly innovation in the energy sector. To have a significant impact, technological solutions capable of harvesting electricity from mechanical energy must also be competitive within the marketplace.

1. Introduction
The burning of fossil fuels is responsible for >80% of primary energy demands and current profiles reveal that the world remains highly dependent on carbon-based power generation resulting in the emission of record levels of carbon dioxide (CO2).1 The growth of the world economy, coupled with industrialization of the developing world, has resulted in a demand for energy that continues to increase.2 Given the growing demand for energy and dwindling oil reserves, the development of alternative sustainable energy is of paramount importance. Energy from solar, wind and tidal waves has the potential to be integrated with electrical power grids to meet mega- to gigawatt power requirements.3 The overall requirements for harvesting these forms of energy are based on a number of factors including low-cost, high stability and high efficiency.3
An increasingly wide range of mobile electronic devices often connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) have not only modified our way of life but also have created the need for a highly diversified energy platform.3 For applications such as medical care,4 healthcare monitoring, infrastructure monitoring, environmental protection and security, many sensors, computer control circuits and antennas are required. Although the power for driving each miniature system is relatively small (from micro to milli-Watt range),3 the collective number of units is forecasted by Cisco (the worldwide leader in information technology) to be trillions by the year 2020.5 The use of batteries to power these units is currently the default solution but this is not sustainable given the large number required and their limited lifespan. Moreover, the concept of the IoT will be rendered meaningless without the inherent ability of devices to be self-powered. This challenge has prompted the development of nanogenerators that harvest mechanical energy from the surrounding environment. Nanogenerators were first developed based on two effects namely, piezoelectricity6–12 and triboelectricity,13–15 with the intention of harvesting energy from activities such as walking, talking, typing and breathing. A string of groundbreaking research advances have subsequently been reported since the landmark publications by Wang and Song.13
The concept of the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is based on the use of the electrostatic charges created on the surfaces of two dissimilar materials when they are brought into physical contact; the contact induces triboelectric charges and generates a potential drop when the two surfaces are separated by a mechanical force, causing electrons to flow between the two electrodes built on the two surfaces.3,16 Following the first publication on TENGs in 2012, huge progress has been recorded. For instance, by the year 2015, the areal power density had reached 500 W m−2,17 and the volume power density attained was 15 MW m−3, with an instantaneous conversion efficiency of around 70%.18 TENGs boast a wide range of applications, given their capability to harvest mechanical energy from a variety of sources, including body motions, vibrations, wind and waves.19 Additionally, the successful application of TENGs in self-powered chemical sensors has recently been demonstrated20–22 for driving electrochemical processes23–25 and commercial light-emitting diodes (LEDs).26–30
Several fabrication processes for TENGs have been described in the extant literature. Specifically, four modes of operation of TENGs, including vertical contact-separation mode, in-plane sliding mode, single-electrode mode and free-standing triboelectric-layer mode were extensively described by Wang et al.3 In this paper, attention is focused on two fabricated modules. The first is a thin-film-based micro-grating triboelectric nanogenerator (MG-TENG). The operation principle of the MG-TENG relies on the coupling between electrostatic induction and the triboelectric effect.17,31–34 Consisting of two sets of complementary micron sized electrode gratings on thin-film polymers, the MG-TENG harvests energy by sliding these surfaces.17 Based on previous research on this technology, a 0.6 g MG-TENG with an overall area of 60 cm2 and a total volume of 0.2 cm3 achieves an average output power of 3 W (50 mW cm−2 or 15 W cm−3) and an overall conversion efficiency of roughly 50%, which is sufficient to power regular electronics such as light bulbs.17 These performance parameters highlight that MG-TENGs are a promising and efficient solution for harvesting energy from mechanical energy under ambient conditions. The second module is a TENG based on two radially arrayed fine electrodes that generates periodically changing triboelectric potential and induces alternating currents between the two electrodes. As presented in previous work, at a rotation rate of 3000 rpm (rotation per minute), a TENG with a diameter of 10 cm achieves an output open-circuit voltage (Voc) of around 850 V and a short-circuit current (Isc) of around 3 mA at a frequency of 3 kHz. Additionally, with a load of 0.8 M, the TENG provides an average output power of 1.5 W (19 mW cm−2), and the efficiency to an external load reaches 24%.26 Here, we fabricated the same structure using a copper electrode on both the rotator and stator layers instead of a gold electrode, which was used as the stator electrode in the previous work.26 In addition, other devices with the same structure fabricated based on copper instead of gold are used,25,35 and the average output power density of the fabricated device used in this study is the same as the previous one. Moreover, the small volume, light weight, low cost, and high scalability characteristics make the TENG a suitable solution for harvesting mechanical energy for both small-scale self-powered electronics and potentially in future larger scale energy generation.
Given the potential of TENGs for low cost energy generation for self-powered applications, it is important to assess their environmental profile and carbon footprint by carrying out a detailed lifecycle assessment (LCA). This will provide an indication as to whether they constitute new environmental challenges or not. A great deal of work has been published on the LCA of energy harvesting technologies. However, to the best of our knowledge, other than the comparative LCA of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) vs. potassium sodium niobate (KNN), both potential materials for piezoelectric energy harvesters,36 no LCA work currently exists on mechanical energy harvesters such as the TENG. Given the limited environmental information on TENGs, LCA is undertaken within the context of other energy harvesting technologies. LCA involves the evaluation of the complete environmental impact of a material or product from the raw material extraction phase, through the processing as well as the usage phases, and the final disposal.37 It is an important technique that should be adopted to highlight the environmental hotspots in the production of consumer goods and their global environmental impact.38 The use of LCA, therefore, defines and addresses environmental sustainability issues that are essential for future development and upscaling. Significantly perhaps, it steers us clear of paths that will create new environmental problems while providing the necessary information with respect to the consequences of material or device substitution.
We live in a world dominated by networked product supply chains, complex production technologies, and nonlinear consumption patterns.39,40 It is essential therefore, for consumers, industries and policy makers, to have the right information in the course of evaluating the environmental consequences of substitute materials (from extraction, design and fabrication processes to usage).36 To date, a detailed cost estimation and techno-economic evaluation and analysis of TENG modules has not been carried out. Such an evaluation is vital regarding the future of TENG technology due to the urgent need to build a cost-efficient industry that can survive with minimal government intervention.41 Accordingly, the power conversion efficiencies and the ensuing financial costs of two TENG module designs were analyzed and compared with existing energy harvesting technologies.
In light of the above, the rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, a brief description of the fabrication processes of both TENG modules under consideration is presented. Details of the overall methodological LCA principles and the techno-economic framework for comparative cost-benefit analysis with existing energy harvesting technologies are presented in Section 3. In Section 4, the key findings from the LCA and techno-economic analysis are discussed leading to the summary and final conclusions in Section 5.
2. Fabrication route of a micro-grating triboelectric nanogenerator (MG-TENG)
To manufacture the TENG modules, roll-to-roll (R2R) processing is used. R2R processing is a cheap and fast substrate-based manufacturing process,42,43 which can build structures in a continuous manner and has become an important manufacturing technology for a wide range of new environmentally friendly and energy-efficient products. Roller-based R2R lines consist of a series of sequential processing steps which begin by feeding input materials and culminate in winding of the finished material. It is often chosen because it can make a sheet or roll at high volume and relatively low cost, a desired attribute for the concepts discussed in this paper. In addition, it is used globally to fabricate high volume commercial products such as flexible electronics, chemical separation membranes and multilayer capacitors.44

Fig. 1(A–C) shows the architectures of Modules A and B, which were assembled with series connections. Module A17 was developed using a new type of electricity-generation method that takes advantage of triboelectrification, a universal phenomenon created upon contact between two materials. Based on polymer thin films that have complementary linear electrode arrays, the MG-TENG (Module A) effectively produces electricity that is sufficient for powering regular electronics as the two contacting surfaces slide with respect to each other. The shape-adaptive design of Module A suggests that it may be ideal for harvesting energy from a wide variety of mechanical motions. Given its high electric output power and other significant advantages in terms of weight, volume, cost, scalability and adaptability, Module A is a practically promising approach in harvesting mechanical motions for self-powered electronics.
 Fig. 1  (A) Structural design of TENG Module A; (B) structural design of TENG Module B and (C) fabrication steps for both TENG modules. 
Module B was developed with a new type of planar-structured, electricity-generation method to convert mechanical energy using the triboelectrification effect. Based on a stator–rotator structure that has arrays of micron sized radial sectors, Module B produces output power sufficient for conventional consumer electronics. It also has the potential to harvest energy from a variety of types of ambient energy from motions such as air flow, water flow and even body motion. The fabrication of Module B requires a series of finely controlled processes and production of patterns with lasers, while DC sputtering is used to produce Cu electrodes. The high precision of the fabrication processes may result, however, in a prohibitively high manufacturing cost.
The main functional differences between Modules A and B are their mode of operation, performance efficiency and potential applications. Whereas Module A operates in a sliding free standing mode, Module B operates in a rotating free standing mode. The performance efficiency of A was experimentally determined to be 50% with a resulting power output of 500 W m−2 and an area of 60 cm2 (see Table 1). For Module B, the calculated conversion efficiency is 24% (78.95 cm2), with a corresponding power output of 190 W m−2 (see Table 1). In terms of their applications, Module B offers more robust and reliable applications regarding energy harvesting from water bodies, wind and body motion under ambient conditions. On the other hand, Module A boasts higher conversion efficiency compared to Module B, but offers less practical applications compared to TENG B.17,26

3. Materials and methods
In the preceding sections, the phenomenon of triboelectricity as a potential effect for energy harvesting is highlighted. Against this backdrop, a detailed environmental profile evaluation and techno-economic analysis of TENG modules are carried out based on the framework schematically illustrated in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 2  Schematic representation of the overall framework for life cycle assessment (LCA) and techno-economic analysis (TEA) of TENG modules. 
3.1 Life cycle analysis framework
LCA can be used as a decision-making tool for the systematic tracking of a wide spectrum of environmental impacts across the entire value chain of the development of a product,45 identifying baskets of interventions for reducing the environmental impact without burden shifting.38,46 LCA entails the gathering and evaluation of the inputs, outputs, and potential environmental impacts of a product system throughout its lifespan and involves four key steps namely: (i) goal and scope definitions, where questions such as what, how and why regarding the LCA work are asked and where the systems boundaries and functional unit are set; (ii) inventory analysis, where input and output data of each process in the life cycle are collated, adding them across the entire system; (iii) evaluation of the environmental effects, detailing LCA results through classification and characterization for comparative analysis; (iv) the interpretation of the inventory and impact assessment of results and the identification of issues that are of significant importance.37,47,48
The goal of this study is to assess the potential life cycle impacts of two TENG modules (A and B). The overall assessment includes five main steps: (i) gaining an understanding of the TENG technology in terms of raw material requirements, and production and fabrication processes of the modules; (ii) characterization of the system (i.e., establishing systems boundaries, the functional unit, modular components, material composition, operational efficiencies, etc.); (iii) construction of the system inventory (i.e., input requirements (physical units), process flow, energy flow, material flow, and reference flow); (iv) overall impact assessment and environmental profile evaluations across multiple sustainability metrics; and (v) performance evaluation and techno-economic analysis.
In this work, the functional unit is set as 1 m2 of the TENG module and all of the inventories generated are converted by aligning them to conform to the functional unit based on the defined system boundaries, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  System boundary considered in the LCA, showing the material composition and energy flows associated with the fabrication steps captured within the inventory. 
The TENG module is assembled by depositing the components onto the substrate. The manufacturing process consumes energy and produces emissions. After the TENG module is utilized and decommissioned, the waste modules are landfilled in the disposal stage. Disposal mechanisms including incineration and waste recycling are not taken into consideration within the system boundaries drawn due to the dearth of data regarding combustion processes or waste recycling for TENG modules. Modular use phases and transportation are also excluded from the system boundaries in line with assumptions made in a number of LCA studies for energy harvesting technologies such as photovoltaics.49–51 Although input–output data can be augmented with process-based data within a hybrid LCA framework36 to complete the system boundaries based on missing data, such an approach is not considered in the current work. The balance of system (BoS) is omitted as part of the overall system boundaries to ensure fair comparison with those of other energy harvesting technologies.

3.1.1 Life cycle inventory. 
The construction of the life cycle inventory (LCI) is central to any LCA work. Based on the system boundaries described in Fig. 3 we classified the LCI of each module into two categories, namely material inventory and energy inventory. A material inventory table consists of the mass of raw materials, direct emission during manufacturing, and disposal materials per functional unit of the module. In this analysis, the focus is on two TENG modules (i.e., Module A and Module B), used as representative solutions for TENG modules. The major differences between the two modules are listed in Table 1.
The material inventory of a 1 m2 functional unit of Module A is shown in Table 2. The active area ratio and the module efficiency are 90% and 50%, respectively.17 The masses of the cleaning solvents, PTFE, and acrylic are obtained from the literature.17,26 The masses of the electrode layer copper and titanium are derived based on the thickness of the corresponding layers, the active area ratio of the module, and the material utilization efficiency. Since the material utilization efficiencies are not reported for TENG modules, we assume that the material utilization efficiencies for laser cutting and sputtering are 30% and 75%, respectively. The mass of direct emission is determined as the mass of the cleaning solvents of ethanol, acetone and deionized water.

The energy inventory of 1 m2 of the TENG Module A is shown in Table 3. As shown, all the operations are performed using electric equipment. Therefore, energy consumption is evaluated by multiplying equipment power by corresponding operating time. We apply the same energy consumption as that evaluated by Espinosa et al.50 The total electricity consumption for manufacturing 1 m2 of the TENG module is 1.14 kW h. We translate the electricity consumption in manufacturing the TENG modules to the equivalent primary energy consumption assuming that the electricity applies to the average electricity mix in the US.52 The end-of-life primary energy consumption accounts for the energy usage involved in landfilling the waste modules.

3.1.2 Life cycle impact assessment modelling. 
The overall impact assessment based on the LCI above is performed following the guidelines provided in the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 1404053 and 14044.54 This allows for the appropriate data management of life cycle inventory and assessment of environmental impacts stemming from each of the materials used for the fabrication of the TENG modules over their life cycle. Each entry of life cycle inventory developed for this work is matched with an appropriate unit process in conformity with the functional unit. Using life cycle inventories, the environmental impacts are calculated as follows:36,55 (1) (2)where bj,i is the environmental burden j per unit activity i, with burdens constituting raw materials and energy consumed within the system and emissions to air, land and water. These parameters are obtained from LCA software and databases such as SimaPro and Ecoinvent.56xi is the mass or energy flow associated with unit activity i. ek,j is the relative contribution of the total burden Bj to impact Ek as defined by the CML 2001 method.57
The overall focus of the current work is on global warming potential (GWP). However, the need to consider multiple sustainability metrics when analyzing the environmental profile of a product or process was demonstrated by Ibn-Mohammed et al.36 This will, for environmental trade-off analysis, ensure that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are not minimized at the expense of other indicators including human toxicity, acidification, eutrophication, material use, fossil fuel and ozone layer depletion.

3.2 Techno-economic evaluation of TENG modules

3.2.1 Module cost estimation. 
To assess the cost of fabricating the modules, we assumed the production capacity of both routes to be 100 MW per year. As shown in Fig. 4, the module cost consists of the capital, the materials and the overhead cost. The capital cost is calculated based on the depreciation of capital investment (CI). Given that the complete process of Module A was based on the fabrication steps in Fig. 1, the CI is taken to be $7 million for a production capacity of 100 MW (see Tables S1 and S2 in the ESI†). Module B has an efficiency of 24% which is lower than that of Module A (50%), as such, the capital investment for Module B (CI Module B) for a 100 MW capacity per year is estimated to be $14 million per year (see Tables S1 and S3, ESI†). Details of how the cost estimates are carried out are presented in Tables S2 and S3 of the ESI.†
 Fig. 4  Cost parameters considered for the techno-economic analysis of TENG modules detailing the relevant materials, overhead costs, capital costs and levelized cost. 
The depreciation of the facility results in a decrease of the capital investment from year to year according to eqn (3):41 (CI)n = CI × βn(3)where n is the number of years after construction and β is the depreciation ratio, which is assumed to be 0.5 based on information from the nascent industry of TENG developers. Depreciation of an investment should cease when βn < 0.1. After four years, there was no further depreciation of the investment because (0.5)4 = 0.063. The capital costs of Modules A and B are based on the ratio of capital investment to the output power, which changed from US$ 0.07 per W to US$ 0.004375 per W and from US$ 0.14 per W to US$ 0.00875 per W, respectively, during the first five years (see Tables S4 and S5 in the ESI† for details). The module cost is calculated by summing the capital amortization, materials, and overhead costs. The capital amortization costs for Modules A and B are taken to be US$ 0.016 per W and US$ 0.032 per W, respectively, based on the annual worth of CI (1.6 million USD for Module A and 3.2 million USD for Module B); they were equated to: (4)where i is the annual interest and n is the 5-year equipment lifetime. An annual interest of 5% is assumed for 2020, based on current low global interest rates. The costs of materials for Modules A and B are estimated to be US$ per 0.617 W and US$ per 2.56 W, respectively, based on the ratio of investment in materials to the output power with a material usage of 80%. The overhead costs consist of labor, renting facilities and utilities. The labor cost of US$ 0.0304 per W was estimated based on the flexible electronics industry average (see Table S7, ESI† for details). Based on a similar industry of DSCs and thin-films, silicon solar cell manufacturing lines, the rents for Modules A and B are estimated to be US$ 0.00792 per W and US$ 0.022 per W, respectively. The costs of utilities for Modules A and B are estimated to be US$ 0.00792 per W and US$ 0.022 per W, respectively. After adding 1% of the capital costs for maintenance fees (US$ 0.0016 million per year and US$ 0.0016 million per year for Modules A and B (Table S8, ESI†)), the overhead costs of Modules A and B are calculated to be US$ 0.04784 per W and US$ 0.075 per W, respectively (Table S8, ESI†).
The resultant module costs, calculated based on our assumptions, are US$ 0.68084 per W and US$ 2.667 per W for Modules A and B, respectively (Table S9, ESI†). These are the baseline values used in the sensitivity analysis (Section 4.5.2). Estimations of the levelized cost of electricity are based on the total cost of a solar cell system, including the costs of the module, balance of systems (BoS), land, support structures, wiring, power conditioning and installation,41 and summed according to eqn (5):58,59 (5)where ICC is the Installed Capacity Cost ($ per W DC) = BoS cost + module cost; CRF is the Capital Recovery Factor, expressed as: (6)where i is the discount rate and n is the useful lifetime (i.e., lifetime of the system), CF is the alternating current capacity factor, calculated as 0.8 × the renewable energy source (i.e., wind energy/8760 hours). This factor is reduced by 37% due to the losses in the conversion process from direct current to alternating current. O&M is the operation and maintenance cost expressed in $ per kW h.
The following assumptions are made. BoS is US$ 75 per m2 based on the projected long term goal of silicon based solar cells in 2020.41 BoS costs at an efficiency of 50% and 40% for Module A are US$ 0.15 per W and US$ 0.1875 per W, respectively. For Module B, with efficiencies of 24% and 20%, the corresponding costs are US$ 0.394 per W and US$ 0.474 per W, respectively. By using BoS cost = 75 US$ per m2; O&M = $0.001 per kW h; i = 5%, and n = 20 (no tax credits and no accelerated depreciation), from these values, CRF (i = 5%, n = 15) = 0.1. In order to derive the energy produced per year due to 1 W of installed TENGs, a CF of 37% is assumed.

4. Results and discussion
4.1 Primary energy consumption and carbon footprint
Primary energy demand and, correspondingly, the carbon footprint due to the fabrication of both TENG modules is the focus of the current LCA work with a view to identify hotspots in the entire supply chain of these modules. Based on the constructed LCIs in Tables 2–5, the primary energy consumption and the corresponding carbon footprint distributions for TENG modules A and B are evaluated and depicted in Fig. 5 and 6, respectively. As indicated in Fig. 5, about 90% of primary energy consumed in both modules is attributed to raw material requirements. A disaggregation of the material embodied energy highlights the key differences between the TENG modules. For instance, in Module A, acrylic (78.18%) and polytetrafluoroethylene, PTFE (20.48%), are the major contributors to the material embodied energy. Similarly, the distribution of embodied material energy is dominated by acrylic, fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP film), and copper with each contributing shares of 96.88%, 2.87% and 0.25%, respectively. As indicated in Tables 2 and 4, the quantities of acrylic in the materials composition of both modules A and B are 1.18 kg and 2.27 kg, explaining their dominance in the total mass of the modules (78.18% for Module A and 96.88% for Module B).
 Fig. 5  Distributions of the primary energy consumption for fabricating two TENG modules. 
 Fig. 6  Distributions of the carbon footprint of TENG Modules A and B. 
In terms of electrical energy consumption (also expressed in MJ m−2 to conform to the unit of material embodied energy), electrode deposition of copper coating/sputtering consumed the largest amount of energy (∼73%) due to the length of time associated with carrying out such a process during the fabrication of Module A. Electrical energies consumed by sputtering for titanium coating deposition and the laser cutting machine constitute roughly 15% and 13%, respectively. Overall, electrode sputtering consumes ∼85% of the electrical energy for the fabrication of Module A. Adoption of alternative deposition techniques for the copper and titanium coating would go a long way in minimizing the overall electrical energy consumption. As for Module B, the increased number of operations involved in its fabrication results in higher electrical energy consumption compared to Module A. As with Module A, sputtering of titanium and copper consumes ∼62% of the electrical energy and the laser machining and associated drilling activities consume 38%. Sputtering as a means of depositing thin films of the metals in the modules guarantees high quality but comes at the expense of high cost.60 Overall, Module B consumes more electrical energy during fabrication compared to Module A.

Fig. 6 shows the distribution of carbon footprint from which the major contributors of the substrate, the copper electrode, sputtering and laser cutting can be established. The distribution of primary energy consumption during fabrication indicates similar patterns to the carbon footprint because different fabrication operations consume only electricity and their conversion to carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) is based on appropriate characterization factors in the evaluation process. Not only do the distributions of primary energy consumption and the carbon footprint exhibit similar patterns, but also the impact of other categories remains identical, provided that the steps involved in the fabrication process remain constant. A resemblance can be found between the distributions of the material embedded primary energy consumption and the carbon footprint, which suggests similar strategies for optimizing both modules for improved environmental performance should be adopted.
4.2 Environmental profile assessment of contributing components of TENG Modules A and B across multiple indicators

Fig. 7 and 8 show the environmental profiles of 1 m2 of TENG Module A and 1 m2 of TENG Module B, respectively. All 11 environmental impact metrics are normalized to 100% with the view that the sum of the impact of each of the contributing processes or materials is 100%. As indicated in Fig. 7, the acrylic is the most significant contributor for carcinogens (82%), respiratory organics (85%), respiratory inorganics (73%), climate change (74%), acidification/eutrophication (76%), fossil fuels (81%), and ecotoxicity (33%). Although the intensity of material embodied energy and CO2-eq of copper, lead and titanium are numerically higher than that of acrylic, given that the quantity of acrylic in the material composition is the largest, its overall impact across the aforementioned impact categories outweighs other materials. Sputtering due to electrical energy consumption also has a great influence on radiation (96%), the ozone layer (83%), and land use (83%). The use of acrylic, however, offers an advantage in the fabrication of the modules. For instance, acrylic has very good structural properties such as lightweight, ease of fabrication, impact resistance and ability to withstand poor weather conditions. Its high strength and durability are also important advantages. Furthermore, acrylic sheets are fabricated using fabrication processes in facilities that are certified by ISO-14001. More importantly, the scenario of their end of life is environmentally viable given their recyclability and reuse potential. Additionally, compared to other plastics that produce toxic gases that are harmful to humans and to the environment during combustion processes, acrylic does not pose such threats due to its stability during exposure to ultraviolet radiation.
 Fig. 7  Environmental profile of 1 m2 of TENG Module A. 
 Fig. 8  Environmental profile of 1 m2 of TENG Module B. 
As shown in Fig. 8, for TENG Module B, the presence of acrylic as in Module A also constitutes the major influence across a number of indicators. For instance, acrylic is the most significant contributor for carcinogens (83.1%), respiratory organics (∼92%), respiratory inorganics (80.8%), climate change (81%), acidification/eutrophication (79.5%) and fossil fuels (88%). The reason for this is similar to that of Module A (i.e., the quantity of acrylic used dominates those of other materials in the structure). Sputtering due to electrical energy consumption also has a great influence on radiation (88%), the ozone layer (70%), and land use (70%).
Comparative life cycle impact assessment results between the two TENG modules are depicted in Fig. 9–11. Module A is used as the standard for normalization. In Fig. 9, Module A performs better environmentally than Module B except in one impact category, minerals. This is attributed to the higher quantities and triple layer thickness of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) used in Module A compared to the single layer thickness of fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP film E) used in Module B. PTFE is generated through polymerization of tetrafluoroethylene using free radicals, and hence has high mineral resource requirements. The uniformity of its material structure (i.e., PTFE), its excellent chemical, electrical and physical properties, its tightly controlled thickness and its inherent capabilities to serve as a semi-permeable membrane render it applicable for TENG and biomedical applications.61 On the other hand, the compatibility of FEP with various chemicals, its reliable electrical properties, its mechanical toughness and its broad thermal range make it suitable for TENG applications.62

As shown, Module B results in more damage compared to Module A.

4.3 Comparison with existing energy harvesting technologies

4.3.1 Eco-indicator. 
Eco-indicator 99 results, across ecosystem quality, resources and human health for eight variants of energy harvesting technologies, notably PV modules, are compared with the TENG modules as depicted in Fig. 12. In all three damage categories, both TENG modules achieve the lowest points and are one order of magnitude lower than those of c-Si, a-Si, ribbon-Si, CdTe, CIS, OPV TiO2 and ZnO PV modules. This clearly demonstrates the overall environmental edge of the TENG modules when compared to PV technologies. Therefore, a more environmentally sustainable energy harvesting technology could potentially be developed based on TENG modules, although this requires switching to greener substrates and reducing the consumption of organic solvents as well as the use of efficient fabrication processes.
 Fig. 12  Eco-indicator 99 results for 1 m2 of each module. The data for c-Si, a-Si, ribbon-Si, CdTe, and CIS are extracted from the study of Laleman et al.63 The data for OPV are extracted from the study of Espinosa et al.50 The data for the TiO2 perovskite module and the ZnO perovskite module were based on the work of Gong et al.64 


4.3.2 Energy payback period. 
In this section, the energy payback periods (EPBPs) of Modules A and B are compared with existing PV technologies (i.e., silicon technologies, thin-film technologies, organic solar cells and perovskite solar cells). The EPBP is given by: (7)The result of the comparison is shown in Fig. 13. As shown, Module A has a shorter nominal EPBP than the other technologies at 0.05 years. Module B also has a shorter EPBP compared to traditional PV technologies but higher than those of organic and perovskite solar cells. The reason for TENGs outperforming silicon and CdTe based PV cells is because their fabrication does not have high energy intensity requirements associated with silicon or rare element purification and processing that causes a higher environmental impact.64 This is largely due to the efficient fabrication routes based on R2R processing. It is important to note that the EPBP of Module B is higher than those of OPV and perovskite solar cells, attributed to its lower output energy compared to the aforementioned technologies. Nevertheless, in the future, by leveraging optimal and efficient processing technologies, the EPBP of TENGs can be further reduced significantly. Overall, the favorable environmental profile and EPBP of the TENG modules compared to the traditional energy harvesting technologies suggest that in the future, they will challenge the existing technologies, whilst contributing immensely towards addressing global energy problems.

4.3.3 CO2 emission factor. 
The CO2 emissions factor (CEF) is given by: (8)
To apply eqn (8), the lifespan of the TENG system under consideration should be established. The lifespan of other existing PV technologies is already well-established. Likewise, assumptions have been made about the lifespan of perovskite solar cells. Given that TENGs are still in their infancy, no exact value in terms of lifespan has yet been reported for them. Fig. 14 shows the comparison of CO2 emission factors for existing energy harvesting technologies to TENG modules. As indicated, the CO2 emission factor for TENG Module B is higher, similar to that of CdTe, Ribbon-Si and P-Si (TENG Module A shows a significantly lower CEF). This suggests that currently the associated cost of CO2 is currently high due to their shorter lifespan (assumed to be 2 years). In the future, it is expected that the lifespan of TENGs will increase considerably due to advancement in material optimization, thereby lowering their CEF. These results deliver an important message for the development of other energy harvesting devices such as TENGs as potential environmentally viable energy harvesters. The TENG is the youngest among the energy harvester technologies with enormous potential for better manufacturing processes with improved efficiency, more stable performance, and a longer operational lifetime.

4.4 Sensitivity analysis
The probability distributions of the two forecasts for the TENG modules are shown in Fig. 15 and 16. Both distributions demonstrate a wide range, with the highest bars representing the values of the highest probabilities. The asymmetric profile of both distributions results from the nonlinear relationship between the input parameters and the sustainability indicators. The simulation results are shown in Fig. 15 and 16. The single cores in both cases are comparatively robust when the key specifications of the modules are subject to uncertainty. The low single core points for the entire 95% confidence regions demonstrate that TENGs are already environmentally competitive.
 Fig. 15  Probability distributions for the single core impact category of Module A. 
 Fig. 16  Probability distributions for the single core impact category of Module B. 
A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to estimate how the environmental performance of Modules A and B alter if the consumption of materials and energy during manufacturing is varied, given the dominating influence of some input parameters across all the considered impact categories. For each parameter, two scenarios were modeled and then compared with the baseline, i.e., a ±10% variations in the total consumption. As shown in Tables 6 and 7, the variation of the acrylic consumption has the highest influence on the Resp. organics. For instance, a ±10% variation of cement consumption leads to ±8.4% and ±9.1% changes in the Resp. organics impact in Modules A and B, respectively. As expected, the mineral impact is most sensitive to the variation of electrode deposition consumption, and a 10% decrease of electrode deposition leads to ±9.7% and ±4.8% corresponding decreases of this indicator for Modules A and B. The fluctuation of manufacturing during construction and operation leads to the largest value change of radiation and about ±9.7% and ±10% variation occurs for Modules A and B, respectively, if the former changes by 10%.

4.5 Techno-economic analysis

4.5.1 Estimation of costs of TENG modules. 

Fig. 17 shows the cost of Modules A and B in the 1st and 5th year and amortization capital cost over 5 years. The module cost can be divided into the materials, the overhead, and the capital cost. The capital costs for Modules A and B are calculated based on the capital costs of TENGs fabricated using the data in Tables S2 and S3 (ESI†), respectively. The cost of the materials is estimated based on the amount used. The overhead cost is estimated based on reasonable assumptions (see Table S8, ESI†). The details of the calculations are shown in the Methods section and the ESI.† The relatively high module cost in the first year is due to the high depreciation rate (50%) of the capital investment. The calculated capital costs in the first year are 0.07 and 0.14 US$ per W for Modules A and B, respectively. The initial capital cost of Module A is lower because the capital investment associated with the use of large efficiency is higher than that in Module B. However, the capital cost rapidly decreased because of depreciation and there is a monotonic decrease of the total module cost during the first 5 years (Tables S4 and S5, ESI†). After that time, the contribution of the capital cost to the total cost is lowered, so that the module cost is determined mainly by the overhead and the materials costs. Fig. 18 presents the distribution of the materials cost for TENG production routes. DSM layers represent device structural materials, D/EM represents electrode dielectric materials and LW represents electrode wire. Other materials costs in Fig. 17 include the expense of Ti/CU deposition. The total calculated cost of materials for Module A is 0.617 US$ per W which is lower than the cost for Module B that is 2.56 US$ per W (Table S6, ESI†). The higher cost of materials for Module B is because both the output power and efficiency are higher in Module A than in Module B.
 Fig. 17  Calculated module costs of TENGs for the first year, the fifth year and amortizing over 5 years by taking depreciation and amortizing capital cost into consideration. The depreciation rate was 50% per year and the capital cost was assumed to remain constant after the five-year period. 
 Fig. 18  Cost of material distribution for Module A (left) and Module B (right). The values of material costs are assumed by the real amount of material used in both structures and the wholesale price. The 80% material usage ratio has been considered. 
Based on thin film silicon solar cell production,65,66 Module A and Module B have total overhead costs of US$ 0.04784 per W and US$ 0.075 per W, respectively (see Table S8, ESI†). Therefore, the total production costs of Modules A and B are similar. In order to compare the costs between different energy harvesting technologies and to calculate the costs for electricity generation and amortization, module costs are also calculated by amortizing total capital cost by the lifetime of the devices. The results show that Module A's amortization cost is US$ 0.68084 whereas Module B's amortization cost is US$ 2.667, as shown in Fig. 18. These results are used in the sensitivity analysis and the estimation of the leveled cost of electricity to obtain an estimate of the cost of electricity generation.


4.5.2 Sensitivity analysis of module cost. 
It is noteworthy that these cost estimates are based on assumptions about the two kinds of TENG structures. However, the assumed parameters might vary when TENGs are commercialized. Hence, we performed further sensitivity analyses to consider the effect of TENGs on module costs. The module costs increase exponentially as their module efficiency decreases (Fig. 19). The solid line corresponds to the efficiency of the present research status. The efficiency of Module A is assumed to be 20–50% based on a current device efficiency of 40–50%. The corresponding estimated module cost is 0.8308–0.86834 US$ per W. And the efficiency is assumed to be 15–24% based on a current device efficiency of 20–24% for Module B. The calculated module cost is 4.731–4.811 US$ per W. If we further extend the solid line, the module costs of Module B decrease dramatically while Module A decreases only slightly. This result reveals that the module efficiency acts as an important factor for module cost no matter which route is used for the manufacturing process. Improvement of the TENG efficiency and active area, by upgrading the precision of deposition methods, will further increase the module efficiency and therefore it will be an effective way to reduce the cost of Module B.
 Fig. 19  Module cost of TENGs as a function of module efficiency. Except for the independent variables in these figures, the other parameters associated with Module A and Module B were fixed. The solid lines were calculated based on the range of reported efficiencies; the dashed lines are based on calculations assuming high module efficiencies that are expected but not yet achieved. 


4.5.3 Levelized cost of electricity produced with TENGs. 
The LCOE is typically used to compare system costs of electricity produced using different sources of energy. The LCOEs of traditional energy sources are 7.04–11.90 US cents per kW h, and the costs of solar PV technologies are 9.78–19.33 US cents per kW h as reported in Levelized Cost and Levelized Avoided Cost of New Generation Resources in the Annual Energy Outlook 2015.67 The LCOE is calculated according to eqn (5) (Section 3), and the output is affected mainly by the module cost, efficiency, and lifetime. In our module cost analysis, both Modules A and B are estimated to produce TENG energy harvesting modules at a cost in the range of 0.68084–2.667 US$ per W. We calculate the LCOE of a TENG energy harvesting module by assuming a module cost of 0.68084 US$ per W for Module A and 2.667 US$ per W for Module B and a lifetime of 15 years. The LCOEs are 2.569 US cents per kW h and 2.681 US cents per kW h corresponding to module efficiencies of 50% and 20%, respectively for Module A. On the other hand, the costs are 9.198 US cents per kW h and 9.43 US cents per kW h corresponding to module efficiencies of 24% and 20%, respectively for Module B, which are lower than those of the traditional energy sources (Fig. 19) for Module A and in the same range of wind power for Module B. Details of the calculations are shown in the Methods section and Table S10 (ESI†). This analysis indicates that the module efficiency has a significant influence on the LCOE.

Fig. 20 shows the effect of lifetime on the LCOE of TENGs for wave energy harvesting. The LCOEs estimate 50% and 40% efficiency for Module A, and 24% and 20% for Module B but each decreases exponentially with the extension of the system lifetime in the range of 10–30 years. For high efficiency (50%) modules, a lifetime of 10 years can lead to an LCOE of 3.42 US cents per kW h. The low-efficiency (40%) modules require a short lifetime (12 years) to achieve a similar LCOE. A conservative estimate of the discount rate of 5% is used above. Based on the above analysis, the module efficiency and lifetime are the most sensitive factors for the LCOE of TENGs. The ultra-low LCOE of TENGs is achieved to be 2.569–2.68 US cents per kW h with 15 years of lifetime, surpassing the United States “Sun Shot Initiative” target of 6.0 US cents per kW h. Hence, improvements of the efficiency and the lifetime of TENGs are urgent tasks from the perspective of cost, and more efforts should be devoted to this field.
 Fig. 20  The relationship between the LCOE and the lifetime. A system lifetime <10 years was not considered in our analysis. 
The LCOE is calculated according to eqn (5) (Method part), and it is affected mostly by the module cost, efficiency, and lifetime. In our cost analysis, the module cost is estimated to be in the range of 0.68–2.667 US$ per W corresponding to TENG Module A and TENG Module B, respectively. We calculate the LCOE of TENG Module A by assuming a module cost of 0.68 US$ per W and a lifetime of 15 years. While, TENG Module B is calculated by assuming a module cost of 2.667 US$ per W and a lifetime of 15 years. The TENG Module A LCOEs are 2.569 US cents per kW h and 2.681 US cents per kW h for efficiencies of 50% and 40%, respectively. On the other hand, the TENG Module B LCOEs are 9.198 US cents per kW h and 9.43 US cents per kW h corresponding to module efficiencies of 24% and 20%, respectively, which are lower than other energy sources (Fig. 21). Details of the calculation are shown in the Methods section and Table S10 (ESI†). Consequently, module efficiency has a significant influence on the LCOE.

5. Summary and concluding remarks
Mechanical energy is available in abundant quantities everywhere around us and is completely independent of weather, day/night or even season. This abundant source of energy remains largely untapped but with continuous and improved power conversion efficiencies reported in the past few years, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have been touted as highly promising sources of electricity generation from mechanical energy. In this paper, a cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment of two TENG modules is performed. The life cycle environmental impact assessment involves 11 midpoint impact categories, and an endpoint evaluation by following the Eco-indicator 99 methodology. We shed light on two important sustainability indicators and find that TENG modules have the shortest EPBT among existing PV technologies. In addition, we find that the environmental hotspots come from the use of acrylic (both Modules A and B), PTFE (Module A) and FEP (Module B). As such, for future development of this technology, material optimization should be advanced. Moreover, we evaluated the sustainable indicators considering the uncertainties of the major input parameters. The resulting probability distributions demonstrate that for TENGs at the current stage, EPBTs are stable and competitive, while CO2 emission factors are less stable. Lastly, through sensitivity analysis, we find that TENG modules are potentially one of the most environmentally sustainable energy harvesters if future development confirms a larger performance ratio and a longer lifetime. To this end, a comparative techno-economic analysis of the TENG modules has been performed based on an annual capacity of 100 MW. We find that the cost of Module A is much lower than other technologies when fully operational, while the cost of Module B is found to be comparable to the cost of hydropower technologies. The results of the sensitivity analysis show that improved performance efficiency reduces significantly the module cost. The fabrication of high-efficiency modules through the adoption of high precision fabrication processes is the most promising approach for further cost reduction. The results indicate an estimated levelized cost of Module A and Module B to be US 2.681 cents per kW h and US 9.43 cents per kW h, respectively. The LCOE of TENGs is also very sensitive to the module efficiency and is expected to be lower than that of other energy technologies if the module efficiency and lifetimes exceed 25% and 15 years, respectively. To achieve these targets, more efforts should be made to improve the lifetime and the efficiency of TENGs rather than to identify cheaper materials and fabrication processes.

Broader context
The ability of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) to convert mechanical energy from various sources into useful electrical energy has drawn attention in recent years. Given their potential for low cost energy generation for self-powered applications, it is important to assess their environmental profile and cost viability by carrying out a detailed techno-economic lifecycle assessment. This will provide an indication as to whether they constitute new environmental challenges or not. In this paper, a robust environmental life cycle assessment within a techno-economic framework is carried out for two TENG modules in the context of other energy harvesting technologies. 11 lifecycle environmental metrics as well as the energy payback periods and carbon dioxide emission factors are determined. Although the environmental impact of both modules is lower compared to traditional PV technologies, the higher quantities of acrylic in one of the modules along with energy-intensive fabrication led to a slightly higher environmental burden. Material optimization focusing on reduced material utilization as well as better fabrication processes should, however, improve their environmental profile. Uncertainty sensitivity analysis is conducted to provide deeper insights into TENGs. The current work therefore lays the foundation for future investigations into the profile of TENGs for environmentally friendly innovation in the energy sector. To have a significant impact, technological solutions capable of harvesting electricity from mechanical energy must also be competitive within the marketplace.
