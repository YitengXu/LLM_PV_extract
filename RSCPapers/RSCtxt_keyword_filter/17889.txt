    , Accepted 9th February 2020First published on 10th February 2020AbstractTitanium dioxide (TiO2) based planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs) suffer from poor long-term stability and show hysteretic behaviour in the device characteristic curve. In addition to the exceptional bulk properties of the perovskite, the performance and stability are also highly dependent on the conduction band energy, conductivity, and electronic trap states of the TiO2 compact layer (CL). In this work, single-phase brookite (BK) TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs), synthesized via a hydrothermal method using a water-soluble titanium complex, are incorporated as a bridge between the perovskite and TiO2 CL. This resulted in uniform large perovskite grain growth with enhanced crystallinity, significant reduction in trap/defect sites and interfacial recombination as revealed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), photoluminescence (PL), and impedance spectroscopy results, respectively. The resulting PSCs show highly reproducible power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to ∼18.2% (vs. ∼15%) with a stable performance of 18% under continuous light illumination (1 sun) at the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) in contrast to only TiO2 CL based planar devices. To the best of our knowledge, this is so far the best photo-stability data reported for brookite NP based PSCs. Based on our present study, at the end we provide further direction to enhance the stability of planar PSCs.
Introduction
Sourcing renewable energy is one of the most important problems of this century, and solar energy can be an important contributor to future energy production. Organometal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs), showing a rapid rise in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 3.8% (ref. 1) to a certified value of 25.2%,2 have emerged as the fastest growing technology in the history of photovoltaics. With the rapid development of perovskite-based optoelectronic devices, their lifetime (stability) has become a new goal besides high efficiency. The stability of PSCs is affected by many extrinsic (environmental) and intrinsic factors. Environmental factors such as moisture, oxygen, light and heat are responsible for the degradation of the photoactive perovskite component into its non-photoactive component.3 On the other hand, the intrinsic stability of a perovskite highly depends on the defects in the perovskite itself and at the interface between the perovskite and charge transport layers (CTLs).4 The hygroscopicity of organic cations, under-coordinated lead atoms, thermal instability, and ion migration are some of the vital intrinsic features that dominate perovskite instability. Hygroscopicity is related to environmental factors, which can be resolved by encapsulation.5 Thermal instability can be addressed by developing perovskite materials through compositional engineering and even by developing all-inorganic perovskite materials and inorganic HTMs.6–8 Recently, Miyasaka et al. reported the main issues in the design and preparation of high-quality photovoltaic films of all-inorganic lead-free perovskite and perovskite-like materials for efficiency enhancement.9 Ion migration which is caused by the illumination-induced electric field can be hindered or even stopped by passivating the grain boundary, that is, through interfacial modification.10 Moreover, it can also be reduced via engineering the packing density of the crystal lattice by ion substitution.11 Besides this, interfacial modification also reduces the recombination centers associated with under-coordinated lead atoms or organohalide defect sites, thus improving the overall performance of the cell.12 Hence, interface engineering is of foremost significance in fabricating long-term stable PSCs. Furthermore, interfacial modification layers not only improve the contact and efficient charge transfer between the perovskite and electron transport layer (ETL)/hole transport layer (HTL), that is, by suppressing the interfacial recombination, but also beneficially change the perovskite morphology, further enhancing the photovoltaic performance besides stability.13
Among the various device architectures explored, titanium dioxide (TiO2) compact layer (CL) based planar structured devices have attracted attention due to the simplicity in their fabrication process. However, perovskite devices with this device architecture suffer from poor long-term stability and show hysteretic behavior in the device current density (J)–voltage (V) characteristic curve. Hence, interface modification of the TiO2 CL has drawn attention for producing highly efficient PSCs. For instance, researchers have modified the TiO2 ETL through interface engineering with anatase TiO2 NPs,14 alkali-doping,15 Nb-doping,16 and solvent engineering.17,18 Yang et al.19 reported efficient PSCs with a PCE of 20.7% by utilizing a multifunctional fullerene derivative on the TiO2 layer (as an interfacial modifying layer) resulting in enhanced device stability under ambient conditions. Previously, we fabricated PSCs by modifying the interface between the perovskite and amorphous compact TiOx layer with fullerene and N-phenyl[60]fulleropyrrolidines (PNP), as a result of which the efficiency significantly improved.20,21 By replacing PCBM ([6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester) with perylene diimide glass as a TiOx modifier, Adhikari et al.22 improved the efficiency of PSCs by 39%. Li et al.23 presented that by using an amine based fullerene as an interfacial modifier, the performance and light stability of planar PSCs can be greatly improved. Zheng et al.24 demonstrated that introduction of a NH4I layer as a novel interfacial modifier between the TiO2 ETL and the perovskite layer not only enhances the PCE over 18% but also significantly reduces the hysteresis and enhances the perovskite device stability against moisture and UV-light. Yang et al.25 reported that using yttrium-doped tin-dioxide nanosheets as the ETL improved the device efficiency from 16.25% to 17.29% with hysteresis free performance. Tan et al.26 reported that using chlorine-capped TiO2 colloidal nanocrystal films as the ETL in PSCs improved their efficiency up to 19.5% along with long term stability. Therefore, the selection of appropriate materials to form stable contact with perovskites is highly desirable to gain high performance and stability.
On the other hand, incorporation of brookite (BK) TiO2 nanoparticles in PSCs has recently attracted attention because the TiO2 layer can be obtained at relatively low temperature, in contrast to the case of anatase TiO2. Additionally, anatase and BK TiO2 polymorphs significantly differ in several crucial parameters, such as the energy position of the conduction band, the distribution and density of the trap states, electron mobility, and the rate constant of the electron transfer rate.27,28 Kogo et al. fabricated compact TiOx/mesoporous BK TiO2-based PSCs with an initial efficiency of 14% for the first time.29 Recently, we compared the effectiveness of single-phase anatase or brookite and heterophase anatase–brookite or brookite–anatase as ETLs in PSCs.30 We found that single phase brookite NPs can solely act as an effective ETL (without the TiO2 CL) and they exhibited a PCE of 14.92% which was comparable to the first study reported by Kogo et al.29 but without any CL. This further suggests that single phase BK TiO2 can solely block the holes effectively due to its highly compact nature and internecking of particles. In addition to this, the large surface area of BK TiO2 NPs facilitates efficient electron injection and subsequent transport, which can balance the electron current density and hole current density in the resultant PSCs and, therefore, can beneficially influence the performance. Even though reports have shown the beneficial effect of BK TiO2 on the device performance, investigation of the effect of brookite TiO2 NPs on the perovskite thin film growth, and their influence on planar device performance compared to only TiO2 CL (without BK TiO2 NPs) based planar PSCs and their stability have not yet been demonstrated.
In this study, we employ synthesized single-phase BK TiO2 (deposited by a low-temperature process) that acts as a bridge between the perovskite and TiO2 CL for improving charge transport in planar PSCs. Pure-phase BK TiO2 NPs were obtained by adjusting the pH of the solution to 10 by addition of NH3 or ethylenediamine which uses a one-step hydrothermal route.31 The results revealed that a weakly basic environment was essential for the formation of BK TiO2 while ammonium ions did not play an important role. From an environmental viewpoint, water-soluble titanium complexes are favorable precursors of titanium-containing functional materials due to their ability to reduce the carbon content per titanium atom. The surface of highly crystalline BK TiO2 facilitates interparticle necking and the formation of compact scaffolds. Moreover, highly crystalline BK TiO2 facilitates high driving force with a more negative flat-band potential and efficient charge-transfer kinetics and resistance28 and exhibits higher conductivity and higher stability compared to the anatase TiO2 phase.30 The perovskite layer grown on BK-TiO2 NPs showed uniform grain growth with large grain size, and reduced bulk and interfacial defects, in contrast to the perovskite thin film grown on the only TiO2 CL. As a result, the BK-TiO2/perovskite planar devices exhibited an improved device performance of up to 18.2% with high reproducibility and enhanced stability under continuous light illumination, light soaking and ambient atmosphere in contrast to only TiO2 CL based devices. This can be credited to the high conductivity of BK TiO2 NPs which decreases the charge accumulation at the interface of BK TiO2/perovskite, resulting in enhanced performance.
Experimental methods
Materials
All the materials were purchased from commercial suppliers and used as received. Lead iodide (PbI2) and methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry (Tokyo, Japan). 0.15 and 0.30 M titanium diisopropoxide bis-(acetylacetonate), Ti(acac)2(OiPr)2 (75 wt% in isopropanol, Sigma-Aldrich), were dissolved in 2-propanol (purity 99.9%, Wako Pure Chemical). N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF; 99.5% purity) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; 99.5% purity) were bought from Wako Pure Chemical (Osaka, Japan). Pure BK TiO2 NPs were prepared by the hydrothermal method reported by Tomita et al.31
Synthesis of brookite TiO2 NPs
Fine powder (5 mmol) of titanium was dissolved in a mixed solution of 30% H2O2 (aq.) and 28% NH3 (aq.). After adding glycolic acid (7.5 mmol), the solution was dried at 50 °C in order to remove excess H2O2 and NH3, and the Ti–glycolate complex solution (0.25 M) was prepared by adding distilled water. Sodium acetate (45 mmol) was dissolved in the Ti complex solution, and the resultant solution mixture was heat-treated in an autoclave at 200 °C for 5 h. The formed TiO2 particles were separated by using centrifugation and washed twice with distilled water. The TiO2 NPs were re-dispersed in distilled water to make a colloidal suspension for the BK TiO2 NP thin film.
Fabrication of TiO2/BK TiO2 NP ETL films and devices
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-patterned glass substrates were cleaned thoroughly and sequentially with commercial detergent in water, deionized water, acetone, and ethanol in a sonication bath. The washed substrates were dried in N2 and then subjected to UV–ozone treatment for 10 min prior to use. Then, the TiO2 CL was deposited on the FTO-glass with an optimal thickness of 40 nm as follows. As reported by Miyasaka et al.,32 the TiO2 CL was deposited via spin coating of the 0.15 M Ti(acac)2(OiPr)2 precursor solution in a 2-propanol solution at 2000 rpm for 30 s, whereas the substrate was on a hot plate at 120 °C for 5 min then cooled down to room temperature. Additional two repeated coatings with higher concentration of the Ti(acac)2(OiPr)2 (0.3 M) solution were spincoated under the same spinning conditions (2000 rpm, 30 s) and dried at 120 °C for 5 min. After this, the substrate was baked at 450 °C for 30 min in a muffle furnace and then left to cool to room temperature. The as-synthesized, pure-phase BK TiO2 NP colloidal suspension was deposited on the TiO2 CL by spin-coating at 2000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 100 °C for 5 min, followed by baking at 180 °C for 60 min in a muffle furnace. The BK TiO2 NPs were reserved as a bridge between the perovskite and TiO2 CL. Perovskite precursor solutions were prepared from 1 M PbI2 and 1 M CH3NH3I in a mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO (4:1) and stirred at 70 °C for 60 min prior to spin-coating. The as-prepared precursor solution was spin-coated in three steps, with the first step at 0 rpm for 10 s, the second step at 1000 rpm for 10 s and the third step at 5000 rpm for 20 s. In the third step 500 μL of chlorobenzene solution was dripped just 12 s before the spin-coating stopped.33,34 The samples were directly transferred to a hot plate at 100 °C for 60 min and cooled to room temperature. For the hole-transport layer (HTL), a spiro-OMeTAD precursor solution was prepared by dissolving spiro-OMeTAD (72.3 mg; Merck, Germany), lithium salt (9.1 mg), cobalt (8.7 mg) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (28.8 μL; Sigma-Aldrich) in 1000 μL of chlorobenzene by vigorous stirring at 800 rpm at RT for 6 h. The as-prepared precursor solution was spin-coated onto the perovskite layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s and the obtained optimized thickness was 250 nm.35,36 To complete the device, a 100 nm thick gold (Au) electrode was thermally evaporated on top of the HTL layer. The optimized thicknesses of the TiO2 CL, BK TiO2 NPs (three-cycle coating), perovskite layer, HTL, and Au layers were measured to be approximately 40, 60, 300, 250, and 100 nm, respectively.
Characterization
The surface morphology was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (S-4800, Hitachi High-Tech, Tokyo, Japan). Ultraviolet-visible near-infrared absorption spectra were measured using a spectrophotometer (V-670, Jasco Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The particle surface areas of the BK TiO2 NPs were determined using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analyses (Bell sorp mini II, Microtrac BEL, Osaka, Japan). The TiO2 nanocrystals and perovskite films were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using an X-ray diffractometer (D8 Discover, Bruker AXS GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) with an X-ray tube (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5406 Å). Charge transport properties with and without BK TiO2 NP-based perovskite films were measured by photoluminescence (PL) (FP-8600, Jasco Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Agilent E4980A Precision LCR Meter, Tokyo, Japan). The current density versus voltage (J–V) curves of the resulting devices were obtained in the forward-scan (FS; −0.2 to 1.2 V) and reverse-scan (RS; 1.2 to −0.2 V) modes at a scan speed of 0.05 V s−1. The active scan area was 0.09 cm2 under 100 mW cm−2 light (AM1.5, 1 sun intensity) generated by using a solar simulator using a Keithley 2401 digital source meter. The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the resulting devices was determined using a monochromatic xenon arc light system (Bunkoukeiki, SMI-250JA).
Results and discussion
The surface area analysis of BK-TiO2 nanoparticles was carried out by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis which revealed that BK TiO2 NPs are uniform with a large specific surface area of 83.71 m2 g−1 as shown in Fig. S1a.† The device architecture was used to examine the performance and stability of the PSCs as shown in the schematic diagram (Fig. 1a). Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was performed to gain understanding of the nanoscale morphology and size of brookite TiO2 NPs (inset in Fig. 1a). Fig. 1b shows the XRD patterns of the perovskite films deposited on the TiO2 CL without and with the BK TiO2 layers. The diffraction peaks of the perovskite film with and without BK TiO2 NPs were observed at 2θ = 14.12°, 28.40°, and 31.91°. These peaks were assigned to the (110), (220), and (310) crystal planes, respectively, consistent with the major phases of the perovskite.37 It should be noted that the PbI2 peak at 12.65° was absent in both XRD patterns, indicating that all PbI2 has been consumed. Additionally, the intensity of the diffraction peak at 2θ = 14.12° was slightly stronger and sharper for BK TiO2 NPs than for the only TiO2 CL case, indicating improved perovskite crystallinity. The higher crystallinity of the perovskite can be attributed to the under-layer effect of BK TiO2 NPs (a mean crystal size of 10.85 nm).31 According to previous reports, the high crystallinity of the under-layer significantly influences the perovskite crystal growth which can be the reason for the improved crystallinity of the perovskite thin film grown on BK-TiO2 NPs.38 The average grain size estimated as the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) from whole-pattern fitting using the Scherrer equation39 was 351 nm in the perovskite film with the TiO2 CL only (which exhibited a polycrystalline morphology) and 670 nm in the film with the TiO2/BK TiO2 NP bilayer (see the ESI; Table S1†).

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to perform top-view and cross-sectional morphological analysis of the TiO2 CL, BK TiO2 NPs, and perovskite films and devices (with and without BK TiO2 NPs). From Fig. S2a† it can be seen that the TiO2 CL covers the entire FTO substrate and from Fig. S2b† it is evident that the BK TiO2 NPs are homogeneously distributed on the TiO2 CL. Fig. 1c and e show the perovskite surface morphology on the TiO2 CL and the TiO2 CL/BK TiO2 NPs, respectively. From Fig. 1e, it can be seen that the perovskite layer consists of large grains when deposited on BK TiO2 NPs in contrast to the case of the TiO2 CL (Fig. 1c). The domain size distribution of the perovskite without and with BK TiO2 NPs is shown in Fig. S3.† From Fig. S3,† it is clear that the perovskite shows small grain size when deposited on the TiO2 CL and the grain size improves with the incorporation of BK TiO2 NPs. This large-grained, uniform perovskite morphology (in the BK TiO2 NP case) caused few grain boundaries, reducing the number of traps and thereby the charge carrier losses at the grain boundaries.40 The average grain size values are consistent with the values estimated from the FWHM (Scherrer's plot) (Table S1†). The perovskite film crystallinity and quality directly relate to the efficiency of the photovoltaic performance and the properties of the cell.33,41 In addition, the cross-sectional SEM images of the perovskite device without and with BK TiO2 NPs are shown in Fig. 1d and f, respectively. From Fig. 1d, it can be seen that the perovskite layer (when deposited on the TiO2 CL) shows a non-uniform morphology with random crystal growth which hampers efficient light absorption. On the other hand, with the influence of BK-TiO2, perovskite crystallization occurred in the vertical direction, as can be seen from Fig. 1f. This vertical perovskite crystallization is beneficial for enhanced light absorption, reduced recombination, and efficient charge transport within the bulk and across the interfaces and hence can effectively enhance the performance of the PSCs.42
To get further insights into the role of BK TiO2 in enhancing the crystallinity of perovskite and its uniform crystal growth, water contact angle measurements were performed and the results are shown in Fig. 2. Surface wetting is an important characteristic for the solution coating procedure. Water contact angles were measured at three different points on each film surface, and the average value is reported. From Fig. 2b it can be seen that the water contact angle is lower for the TiO2 CL/BK TiO2 NP layer (4.1°) than for the only TiO2 CL (13.2°) (Fig. 2a). This can be attributed to the single phase and inter-necking of the BK TiO2 NPs. A low water contact angle indicates enhanced hydrophilicity of the surface which is favorable for perovskite crystallization and grain growth. These results are in line with XRD (Fig. 1b) and SEM (Fig. 1b–f) results, that is, high surface wettability (as in the case of BK-TiO2 NPs) can beneficially help the perovskite grain growth leading to enhanced grain size and crystallinity.

To check the effect of the BK TiO2 NP layer on the device performance, the devices were fabricated (with and without the BK-TiO2 interlayer) and photovoltaic properties were measured. Fig. 3a depicts the current density (J)–voltage (V) characteristic curves and the corresponding device parameters are summarized in Table 1. The comparison of the FS and RS results is summarized in Table S3.† For the TiO2 CL case, the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) were comparatively lower than those of BK-TiO2 NP based devices (Fig. S4†). Additionally, large hysteretic behavior was observed in the device J–V curve (Fig. S4†). This hysteretic behavior has also been observed previously for TiO2 CL based planar PSCs.43 The best TiO2 CL-based PSC exhibited (in the reverse scan) a considerably low Jsc of 21.18 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.05 V, FF of 0.69, and PCE of 15.36% (Table 1). Although solely TiO2 CL based PSCs have shown moderate efficiency, these devices demonstrate photo-induced degradation and also suffer from large hysteresis in the device characteristic J–V curve because of which the actual device performance is underestimated. From the IPCE spectra (Fig. 3b) it can be seen that the coverage is poor (for TiO2 CL-based devices) ranging from ∼500 nm to 780 nm. The IPCE spectrum in the longer wavelength region corresponds to perovskite bulk and interface quality. The lower coverage for the TiO2 CL based device indicates that the perovskite quality and its interfacial connection with charge transport layers are poor. To understand the effect of BK-TiO2 NPs on the perovskite crystal growth, and bulk and interfacial connection quality, initially the devices were prepared with only BK-TiO2 NPs (without the TiO2 CL). Fig. S5a† shows the J–V spectrum of the only BK-TiO2 NP based perovskite device. Interestingly, the IPCE coverage (Fig. S5b†) is significantly higher especially from ∼500 nm to ∼780 nm. However, the device performance is moderate (∼14%) which is almost comparable to that of only TiO2 CL based devices. According to a previous report, the TiO2 CL itself can undergo trap assisted recombination and this can also be the reason, in addition to poor perovskite crystallization and grain growth, for low device efficiency.44 Moreover, these results significantly suggest that BK-TiO2 NPs can enhance the perovskite quality and interfacial connection effectively.

Therefore, to enhance the quality of the perovskite on the TiO2 CL and simultaneously improve the efficiency, the devices were fabricated by incorporating BK-TiO2 NPs at the interface of the CL and perovskite and the results are shown in Fig. 3a. To obtain the optimized conditions and to verify the effect of the BK TiO2-layer thickness on the performance enhancement of PSCs, the number of BK TiO2 NP coating cycles on TiO2 was varied as one, three, and five cycles. Fig. 3c shows the J–V characteristics of the PSCs with BK-TiO2 NPs of varying thickness, and significant improvement in the device performance was observed with three-cycle coating (optimized conditions). The device performance considerably enhanced to 18.14% after incorporating BK-TiO2 NPs (18% higher than that of single TiO2 CL based PSCs). This improved performance was mainly due to enhancement in the Jsc (23.10 mA cm−2) and FF (0.73), which can be ascribed to vertical perovskite grain growth (Fig. 1f). Moreover, TiO2 CL/BK TiO2 NP based PSCs also showed a low hysteresis characteristic in the device J–V curve (Fig. S4†); however, the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) results (which will be discussed later) showed a stabilized efficiency of 18% further suggesting that the performance of the backward scan is more reliable. Such lower device performance (for the only TiO2 CL case) can be due to the contact barrier that prevented efficient electron injection at the compact TiO2–perovskite interface and due to the poor perovskite crystallinity and morphology, and is also influenced by high water contact angle (Fig. 2a). Consequently, there were a huge leakage current and recombination of charge carriers (which will be discussed further) due to smaller grain size and a large number of grain boundaries. On the other hand, the significant performance improvement for the TiO2/BK TiO2 NP-based PSCs over TiO2-based PSCs was attributed to their high crystallinity and conductivity, which may prevent the recombination of photogenerated carriers.45 Moreover, the synthesized highly crystalline BK TiO2 NPs are more beneficial than the TiO2 CL because they expose a large interface area for electron injection and subsequent transport which better balances the charge carriers. The PCE histograms (Fig. 3d) of twenty devices reveal the good reproducibility of TiO2 CL/BK TiO2 NP based PSCs compared to the TiO2 CL-based PSCs.
To verify the performance reproducibility of the PSCs based on the TiO2 and TiO2 CL/BK TiO2 NP layer films, we compared the average Jsc, Voc, FF, and PCE values of PSCs of each type which are shown in Fig. 4. The TiO2 CL/BK TiO2 NP layer ETL-based devices produced better reproducibility and superior PCEs of 16.82 ± 0.90% compared to the single TiO2 CL devices (PCEs of 13.16 ± 1.90%). The IPCE coverage also significantly improved, particularly in the range of ∼500 nm to ∼780 nm, with the incorporation of BK-TiO2 NPs as shown in Fig. 3b. This significantly evidences the enhanced perovskite film and interface (with the neighboring charge transport layer) quality and the reduced interfacial energy barrier for BK-TiO2 based perovskite devices. Moreover, the vertical perovskite grain growth is also responsible for enhanced light absorption and efficient charge carrier generation and transport and thus improved IPCE coverage. From the IPCE data, the integrated photocurrents in the devices based on the TiO2 CL and the TiO2 CL/BK TiO2 NP layer were 18.76 and 22.09 mA cm−2, respectively.

Recently, we reported that the anatase TiO2 NP layer promotes the growth of the perovskite film and significantly enhances its performance.14 Single-phase anatase TiO2 NPs enhance the interparticle adhesion to the perovskite across the interface, thus reducing the number of nucleation sites. The low nucleation energy boundary at the interface then effectively facilitates perovskite nucleation. Similarly, we assume that the large surface area of BK TiO2 NPs enhances the cohesion of the TiO2/perovskite interface, reducing the number of surface defect traps and improving the perovskite morphology.
To further get insights into perovskite bulk and interfacial properties, the charge transfer through the interface between the perovskite and the TiO2 layers was investigated by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 5a, the PL peak intensity of the perovskite film on BK-TiO2 NPs was significantly quenched compared to that of the only TiO2 CL. The strong PL quenching in the TiO2 CL/BK TiO2 NP/perovskite film reveals efficient charge transfer at the interface between the photoexcited perovskite and the TiO2 CL/BK TiO2 NP layer. The significant quenching (Fig. 5a) and the slightly enhanced absorption (Fig. S6†) and much enhanced quantum efficiency (Fig. 3b) encourage charge transport across the TiO2–perovskite interface. In addition to this, Fig. 5a also shows an additional blue-shift in the PL peak from 768 nm to 763 nm. From this it is evident that the perovskite thin film grown on BK-TiO2 NPs consists of lower trap states within the bulk, revealing efficient reduction in the non-radiative recombination centers and improved charge transfer within the perovskite films.46 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to further investigate the electrical properties of interfaces such as charge transfer, carrier recombination, and the inner series resistance within the devices. Fig. 5b shows the Nyquist plots of the resultant devices at a DC bias of 0 V under dark conditions. According to the equivalent circuit model (Fig. 5b (inset)), the detailed fitting parameters of series resistance (Rs) and recombination resistance (Rrec) are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). The TiO2/BK TiO2 structure-based device exhibits smaller Rs and much larger Rrec, indicating more efficient extraction and transport of electrons at the TiO2/BK TiO2/perovskite interface due to the type-II band alignment, thus resulting in larger Jsc, Voc, and FF compared to the only TiO2 layer.

A 1 V AC signal was applied with a frequency range of 20 Hz to 1 M Hz. The inset shows the equivalent circuit model of the resultant devices. 
Long-term stability is one of the most vital requirements for the future commercialization and market acceptance of PSCs. The perovskite device degrades when exposed to moisture, oxygen, light and heat.47 In spite of some good approaches such as encapsulation, PSC degradation cannot be basically eliminated, mostly due to the intrinsically irreconcilable contradictions of the electronic processes, which take place therein.48 In this work, we measured the device stability under continuous light illumination of 1 sun, light soaking and ambient atmosphere as shown in Fig. 6. The best performing devices (with and without BK-TiO2 NPs) are exposed to continuous light illumination, that is, at the maximum power point tracking (MPPT), and the results are shown in Fig. 6a. The only TiO2 CL based PSCs reached stabilized efficiency after a certain period of time (Fig. 6a) and degraded immediately within 100 s. This can be due to the presence of defect centers/trap states at the perovskite/TiO2 CL interface which is consistent with the SEM, PL, and impedance results. On the other hand, the TiO2 CL/BK-TiO2 based perovskite device showed a sharp stabilized efficiency of 18% (up to 300 s). As discussed above, the device characteristic J–V curves showed hysteresis in both cases which underestimates the actual performance of the PSCs. However, MPPT results reveal a stabilized efficiency of ∼18% and 10% for BK TiO2 NP layer-based and TiO2 CL-based devices, respectively. The obtained stabilized efficiencies are close to the backward scan in the case of BK-TiO2 NP-based devices and the forward scan in the case of the TiO2 CL based device. From this, it can be inferred that a significantly high efficiency (∼18%) can be obtained with the BK-TiO2 NP-based devices in contrast to the only TiO2 CL based devices.38,49 Furthermore, the stabilized efficiency significantly evidences that the traps at the perovskite/TiO2 CL interface50 are significantly reduced with the incorporation of BK TiO2 NPs. In addition, to support the MPPT (stability) results, a light soaking test was performed by exposing the non-encapsulated BK TiO2 NP based-device for ∼2 h under continuous light illumination (1 sun) in air with high humidity (in the range of 60–70%). As shown in Fig. 6b, the devices retained 88% of their initial efficiency after the light soaking test. This stabilized efficiency is attributed to the enhanced perovskite thin film quality, and reduced defect sites and recombination centers within the bulk and at the interface (as evidenced from PL and impedance measurements) which is influenced by the pure single phase nature of BK TiO2 NPs. This promotes fast interfacial transfer of charge carriers from the light absorber to the TiO2 CL. Moreover, the desired band alignment between the anatase and brookite phase can protect charges in the TiO2 from recombination, leading to a higher density of electrons in the brookite TiO2 phase than in common anatase. Although the conduction band edge of brookite is slightly higher than that of anatase, the favorable band alignment significantly blocks the extracted electrons from interfacial recombination with the holes during operation of the PSCs, leading to efficient charge transfer from BK TiO2 NPs to the TiO2 CL. Thus, the BK TiO2 NP phase bridges the perovskite–TiO2 CL interfacial charge transfer and promotes large perovskite grain growth, resulting in improved device performance.
 Fig. 6  (a) The efficiency at the maximum power point under continuous 1 sun illumination (100 mW cm−2), (b) normalized PCE vs. time (in seconds) of TiO2 CL/BK TiO2 NP based PSCs (non-encapsulated), after exposing to 2.12 h of continuous light illumination (1 sun) in air in the humidity range 60–70% and (c) normalized PCE versus time (in days) of PSCs (non-encapsulated) stored in the dark with dry N2. The resultant devices were measured under the ambient 60–70% relative humidity conditions. 
In addition, we further measured the moisture stability of the PSCs with and without a BK TiO2 NP layer. The J–V characteristics of the devices were measured in air (without sealing or encapsulation) before and after storing in the dark. It should be noted that all devices were measured in air (60–70% humidity) at 20 °C. The photovoltaic parameters (normalized PCE) versus degradation time (days) are plotted in Fig. 6c. The PSCs with the BK TiO2 NP over-layer degraded more slowly than those with the TiO2 layer alone. The PCEs of the BK TiO2 NP layer-based PSCs presented long-term stability against moisture, retaining 75% of their initial values even after 28 days. The stability is mainly improved by the high-quality perovskite film obtained on highly conductive crystalline BK TiO2 NPs. Therefore, the remarkable long-term stability of the TiO2 CL/BK-TiO2-based perovskite devices is probably conferred by the high potential of the BK TiO2 NPs. The PCE of the TiO2 CL/BK-TiO2 NP based perovskite device degraded by just 16% after dark storage for 47 days. Fig. S7† shows the PCE, Jsc, Voc, and FF changes in the device throughout the storage time (in days).
By benchmarking our results, we provide further direction towards enhancing the efficiency and stability of BK-TiO2 NP based PSCs. The efficiency can be further enhanced by selecting a suitable CL such as SnO2 in combination with single-phase synthesized BK-TiO2 NPs. This combination can not only provide low-temperature fabrication of perovskite devices but also can deliver enhanced efficiency beyond 22%. Investigating the effect of BK-TiO2 on the crystal growth of composition engineered perovskites can provide more significant insights into enhancing the stability of PSCs. The low temperature thin film deposition of BK-TiO2 NPs, as presented in this study, can also pave the way for large scale production of PSCs with high efficiency and stability.
Conclusions
Single-phase BK TiO2 NPs with a large specific surface area (∼83.71 m2 g−1) allow for the surface morphology tuning of the TiO2 films. This approach can efficiently improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs as well as their stability. After coating three layers of BK TiO2 NPs on TiO2 (thickness 60 nm), the PCE of the fabricated PSCs was maximized to 18.14%, suggesting that 60 nm is the optimal thickness of the BK TiO2 NP layer. The PSCs with the TiO2 CL/BK TiO2 NP layer exhibited excellent photovoltaic performance and photostability under continuous light illumination of 1 sun, that is, at the MPPT period, compared to standard PSCs, because the photogenerated electrons were quickly transported to their respective electrodes. These highly conductive NPs were assumed to mainly contribute to the device stability. The outstanding performance of the BK TiO2 NP layer ETL-based device was attributed to the increased number of photogenerated charge carrier sites and reduced agglomeration and trapping at the TiO2 interface, as evidenced in the PL and EIS analysis. This work will advance an alternative approach to anatase TiO2-based PSC applications, with the photovoltaic device performance and preservation stability being enhanced.
