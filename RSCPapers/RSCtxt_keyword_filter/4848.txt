    , Accepted 27th September 2021First published on 28th September 2021AbstractThe flexibility and stability of organic solar cells (OSCs) are becoming hotspot research due to their practical applications. Molecular arrangement and network morphology of the active layer are important factors affecting the flexibility and stability of OSCs. Here, two polymer donors (PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl) with different side chains were investigated as the third component to finely regulate morphology and molecular accumulation of the active layer to improve the performance of OSCs. Both third components show complementary absorption spectra and good compatibility. The good planarity of PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl significantly increases intermolecular overlap to promote the charge transfer in the active layer. In addition, the steric hindrance of the one-dimensional side chain of PBB1-Cl enhanced the intermolecular close packing and entanglement of the active layer. As a result, the tensile endurance of PM6:PBB1-Cl:Y6-BO-4Cl ternary blend film reached 4.6 times (26.86%) of the PM6:Y6-BO-4Cl binary blend film. Furthermore, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) increased from 15.83% for PM6:Y6-BO-4Cl based binary OSCs to 17.36% for PBB1-Cl based rigid ternary OSCs, and the flexible OSCs increased from 13.44% to 14.96%, respectively. 17.36% efficiency of PBB1-Cl based ternary OSCs is the highest value in OSCs with elongation at the break of active layer exceeding 25% so far. Further, the PCEs of PBB1-Cl-based flexible ternary OSCs still remain above 74% within 500 cycles of bending with a diameter of 10 mm or annealing at 100 °C for 24 hours, which is mainly attributed to the smaller surface energy difference between PBB1-Cl-based ternary blend film and transport layers, higher glass transition temperature and larger elongation at break of the active layer. All results suggest that enhancing intermolecular overlapping fasten packing in the active layer has great potential in improving the photovoltaic performance, mechanical and thermal stability of OSCs.

Broader context
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted extensive research on lightweight, low cost, good flexibility, translucency and other superiority. As the core of photoelectric conversion of OSCs, the active layer with good flexibility and stretchability is of great significance to realize flexible and wearable electronic devices. In this work, two polymer donors with good planarity and different sidechain substitutions were synthesized as the third component to optimize the molecular stacking of the active layer. The results show that intermolecular overlapping fastens packing has great potential for optimizing the morphology of the active layer to improve the photovoltaic performance, mechanical and thermal stability of OSCs.

Introduction
In recent years, organic solar cells (OSCs) have been continuously researched for their unique advantages such as lightweight, wide absorption range, simple preparation process and potential good flexibility.1–3 With the continuous development of photovoltaic materials and device engineering, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs have reached 17–18%.4–6 The improved efficiency stimulates the industrialization of OSCs, but the problem of device stability, including optical stability, air stability, thermal stability and mechanical stability, still needs to be solved. At present, optical and air stability can be solved by packing technology.7,8 However, how to effectively improve the thermal and mechanical stability of OSCs is of great significance to realize practical applications.
As the core of photoelectric conversion of OSCs, the material and morphology of the active layer have a significant impact on the thermal and mechanical stability of OSCs.9 In general, the morphology of the active layer is a metastable structure. With the passage of time, the molecules of active layers will twist and wriggle, especially at high temperatures.10 Molecular rearrangement can lead to delamination between materials, which could affect the exciton dissociation and charge extraction. Therefore, reducing the temperature sensitivity of active layers by improving the glass transition temperature (Tg) is particularly necessary for improving the thermal stability of the device.11 In addition, the interlayer interaction between the active layer and transport layers is also critical to the stability of devices. Reducing the difference in surface energy (γs) between transport layers and the active layer can weaken the possibility of interlayer separation, thereby improving the mechanical and thermal stability of the device. Comprehensive consideration of the optimization of internal and external characteristics of active layers is an important research direction to improve the mechanical and thermal stability of the device.
More interestingly, unlike inorganic solar cells, OSC can be applied to the field of flexible and wearable electronic devices, which also put forward more stringent requirements on the active layer. Molecular entanglement and twist in the active layer are important factors affecting the flexibility and stretchability of OSCs.12 The typical literature about the stretched property of active layers and related OSC performance reported in recent years are summarized in Table 1. It can be found that OSCs with both high efficiency and good tensile properties are very rare. Reasonable molecular design and fine morphology control can enhance the molecular entanglement in the active layer, which should be an important aspect to improve its tensile properties and obtain highly flexible and stable OSCs.13

The ternary strategy has been proved to be a simple and effective method to improve the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.14–16 The introduction of a third component can enhance the photon capture ability, optimize the molecular arrangement and morphology of the active layer, and adjust the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the device.17–19 The synergy of two donors or two acceptors can give full play to the advantages of active materials, thereby significantly improving the device performance. However, compared to the dual acceptor system, only a few polymer donors have been studied as the third component of efficient ternary OSCs (Table S1, ESI†), which should be attributed to the difficulty in controlling the morphology and molecular stacking between polymer materials. Therefore, if appropriate polymer can be selected as third component to enhance intermolecular ordered stacking and entanglement, so as to optimize the internal and surface characteristics of the active layer, which can not only improve the photovoltaic performance, but also the flexibility, stretchability and stability of the device.
In this work, two polymer donors PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl with different side chains were utilized as a third component to improve the performance of OSCs. The PCEs of PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl based rigid ternary OSCs are 17.36% and 17.09%, respectively, which are significantly higher than those of the PM6:Y6-BO-4Cl based binary OSCs (15.83%). The improved photovoltaic performance is mainly attributed to the enhanced photon capture and optimized morphology of the active layer with the third component, thus improving the charge generation and extraction of OSCs. What is more, the mechanical and thermal stabilities of PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl-based ternary OSCs are significantly improved compared to PM6:Y6-BO-4Cl-based binary OSCs. The PCEs of PBB1-Cl-based flexible ternary OSCs reached 14.96% and were still maintained above 74% within 500 cycles of bending with a diameter of 10 mm or annealing at 100 °C for 24 h. Interestingly, the better planarity and smaller steric hindrance of PBB1-Cl enhanced the intermolecular packing and entanglement in the active layer, resulting in a 4.6-fold (5.83% vs. 26.86%) increase in the tensile properties of PBB1-Cl-based ternary blend films. When elongation at the break of the active layer exceeds 25%, 17.36% efficiency of PBB1-Cl-based ternary OSCs is the highest value at present. In addition, the higher Tg and the weaker absorption temperature sensitivity of PBB1-Cl-based ternary blend films confirmed the improvement of thermal stability. Meanwhile, the smaller γs differences between the PBB1-Cl based ternary blend film and transport layers can reduce the possibility of interlayer separation, which can be beneficial to improve the mechanical and thermal stabilities of the device. All results show that intermolecular overlapping fasten packing in PBB1-Cl based ternary active layer can effectively improve the photovoltaic performance, mechanical and thermal stabilities.
Results and discussion
The chemical structures of the active materials PM6, Y6-BO-4Cl, PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl and the synthesis process of PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl are shown in Fig. 1(a) and Fig. S1 (ESI†), respectively. The polymer donors PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl with different side chains have great differences in film morphology and the stacking mode. In order to analyze the compatibility of different donor materials, the contact angles of PM6, PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl films based on water (H2O) and diiodomethane (CH2I2) were measured and the data is shown in Fig. 1(b). The calculated γss of PBB1-Cl, PBB2-Cl and PM6 films were 36.9, 34.3 and 35.6 mN m−1, respectively. Similar γss values between PM6 and PBB1-Cl or PBB2-Cl films indicate their good compatibility, which can facilitate the interaction between two donors in the ternary active layer.28 UV-Vis absorption spectra of PM6, PBB1-Cl, PBB2-Cl and Y6-BO-4Cl neat films were measured as shown in Fig. 1(c). The absorption spectra of PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl films are mainly in the range of 400-600 nm, but the absorption cut-off edge of PBB1-Cl is slightly blueshifted than that of the PBB2-Cl film. Both PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl films show good complementary absorption spectra with PM6 and Y6-BO-4Cl, which is beneficial to enhance the photon capture.29 The energy levels of PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), and energy levels were calculated and given in Table S2 (ESI†). The corresponding energy-level diagrams of all the used materials are shown in Fig. 1(d). PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl with lower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels are conducive to obtain higher VOCs in devices.

The absorption spectra of the binary and ternary blend films with different PBB1-Cl or PBB2-Cl content are shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b), respectively. With the increase of PBB1-Cl or PBB2-Cl contents, the absorption intensity of the ternary blend films is significantly enhanced before 550 nm. It is worth noting that the absorption of ternary blend films at the acceptor position is significantly enhanced, which should be attributed to the addition of the third component promoting the accumulation and arrangement of the molecular acceptor.30 By comparison, the addition of PBB1-Cl is more conducive to the formation of strong acceptor aggregation in blend films than that with PBB2-Cl. Interestingly, the absorption onset edge and the absorption peak at Y6-BO-4Cl of the blend film are slightly blue-shifted after the addition of PBB1-Cl, which should be attributed to the effect of PBB1-Cl on the molecular arrangement of Y6-BO-4Cl and the morphology of the active layer.

The OSCs were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINO/Al, as shown in Fig. 2(c). The J–V curves of PM6:Y6-BO-4Cl based OSCs with different PBB1-Cl or PBB2-Cl contents are given in Fig. 2(d) and (e) and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table S3 and S4 (ESI†), respectively. The photovoltaic parameters of the typical binary and ternary OSCs are listed in Table 2. The PM6:Y6-BO-4Cl-based binary OSC exhibits a PCE of 15.83% with a JSC of 25.68 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.845 V and an FF of 72.94%. After adding 20 wt% PBB1-Cl, the optimized ternary OSCs show a 17.36% PCE with a JSC of 26.84 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.866 V and an FF of 74.63%. The improved JSC should be mainly attributed to the optimization of photon capture and charge extraction ability in the active layer by adding an appropriate amount of PBB1-Cl. The increased VOC can be well explained by the lower HOMO level of PBB1-Cl than PM6. The enhanced FF could be attributed to the addition of the third component that can optimize the morphology of the active layer, and thus obtaining a more effective charge transfer and extraction of OSCs. The optimized ternary OSCs with 20 wt% PBB2-Cl in donors exhibit a PCE of 17.09% with a JSC of 26.77 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.850 V and an FF of 75.04%. The PBB2-Cl-based ternary OSCs show a similar variation of photovoltaic parameters with PBB1-Cl-based ternary OSCs. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of PM6:Y6-BO-4Cl-based binary and optimized ternary OSCs are shown in Fig. 2(f). It can be seen that the EQE spectra of PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl-based ternary OSCs are significantly higher than that of PM6:Y6-BO-4Cl-based binary OSCs, especially in the wavelength range before 600 nm. In addition, the EQE spectrum of PBB1-Cl-based ternary OSCs is blue shifted, which is consistent with the absorption spectra. Other slight differences between the absorption and EQE spectra are mainly due to the diffraction effect and the interference effect between the incident light and the reflected light from Ag electrode in the active layers.31 The calculated JSCs from EQE spectra are 24.83, 25.90 and 25.61 mA cm−2, which are consistent with the change of JSCs measured by J–V curves. The slightly lower calculated JSCs values are mainly attributed to the device's EQE spectrum tested in an air environment without any packaging. The shunt resistance (Rsh) and series resistance (Rs) of binary and ternary PSCs were calculated as shown in Table 2. We can clearly observe that the Rss of the ternary OSCs is reduced by adding the third components, especially PBB1-Cl based, which should be attributed to optimizing the surface energy and morphology of the active layer to reduce the contact resistance.32 In addition, Rshs of ternary OSCs are also increased by adding PBB1-Cl or PBB2-Cl. The increased Rshs and decreased Rss can be conducive to improving charge transport and reducing charge recombination to enhance the FF of the device.33

To study the effect of different sidechain-substituted polymer donors PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl on device performance, the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) curves of PM6:Y6-BO-4Cl based binary and optimized ternary OSCs were measured and are shown in Fig. 3(a); and the detailed parameters are listed in Table 3. The Jph is calculated by subtracting the dark current density (JD) from light current density (JL).34Veff is calculated by subtracting V from V0, where V0 is the voltage corresponding to Jph equal to 0, and V is the applied bias voltage.35 It is estimated that when Veff reaches 1 V, all devices are close to saturation current density (Jsat).36 Compared with the binary OSCs, PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl-based ternary OSCs show larger Jsats of 27.56 and 27.28 mA cm−2, respectively. The increased Jsats are mainly attributed to the incorporation of the third components to optimize photon capture in the active layer. The exciton dissociation efficiency (ηdiss) and charge collection efficiency (ηcoll) can be roughly estimated by Jph/Jsat under conditions of short circuit or maximal power output.37 The ηdisss of the PM6:Y6-BO-4Cl-based binary, PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl-based ternary OSCs are 96.0%, 97.3% and 98.1%, respectively. The ηcolls of PM6:Y6-BO-4Cl-based binary, PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl-based ternary OSCs are 83.3%, 86.4% and 87.2% respectively. The enhanced ηdisss and ηcolls indicate that the phase separation and morphology of the active layer are optimized by the addition of an appropriate amount of PBB1-Cl or PBB1-Cl.

The electron and hole mobilities were measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with special structures of ITO/ZnO/active layer/PDNO/Al and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag, respectively.38 The ln(JL3/V2)–(V/L)0.5 curves are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†) and the corresponding mobility values are exhibited in Fig. 3(b). After adding an appropriate amount of PBB1-Cl or PBB2-Cl in the active layer, the electron mobility (μe) is increased from 4.23 to 8.73 or 7.76 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the hole mobility (μh) is increased from 5.70 to 9.35 or 8.55 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The increase of μh and μe are beneficial to the charge extraction and transmission of optimized ternary OSCs. In addition, the μh/μe values of PM6:Y6-BO-4Cl binary, PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl-based optimized ternary blend films are 1.34, 1.12 and 1.10, respectively. The more balanced charge transfer is conducive to the improvement of FF in optimized ternary OSCs.
The J–V curves of OSCs under different light intensities were investigated to analyze the charge recombination with/without of PBB1-Cl or PBB2-Cl. The VOC–Plight and JSC–Plight curves are described in Fig. 3(c) and (d), respectively, the corresponding parameters are also listed in Table 3. The relationship between VOC and Plight can be expressed as VOC ∝ nkT/qln(Plight), where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the thermodynamic temperature, and q is the elementary charge.39 The n values of PM6:Y6-BO-4Cl based binary and PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl-based ternary OSCs are 1.19, 1.12 and 1.08, respectively. The n values of ternary OSCs are closer to 1, indicating that trap recombination is suppressed in OSCs. In addition, the relationship between JSC and Plight can be expressed as JSC α Plights.40 The s values of PM6:Y6-BO-4Cl-based binary, PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl-based ternary OSCs are 0.95, 0.97 and 0.98, respectively. The s values of ternary OSCs are closer to 1, indicating that bimolecular recombination is inhibited. The inhibition traps and bimolecular recombination of PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl-based OSCs can facilitate effective charge transfer to enhance JSCs and FFs, which should be mainly attributed to the influence of different sidechain donors on the morphology and transmission characteristics of the active layer.
The transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) were also measured to further investigate the charge recombination and extraction of OSCs with PBB1-Cl or PBB2-Cl as the third component. As shown in Fig. 3(e), the estimated photocarrier lifetime (τrec) of PM6:Y6-BO-4Cl-based binary, PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl-based ternary OSCs are 40.8, 47.9 and 50.5 μs, respectively. The longer τrecs of the optimized ternary OSCs indicate that charge recombination is effectively suppressed.41 The charge extraction time (τext) can be estimated from fittings TPC decays under short-circuit conditions. As shown in Fig. 3(f), the τexts of PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl-based optimized ternary OSCs are 4.1 and 5.8 μs, which are significantly faster than 15.5 μs of PM6:Y6-BO-4Cl-based binary OSCs. The result indicates that the charges in optimized ternary OSCs can be quickly swept out, which is consistent with the significantly increased mobility.42 The longer τrecs and faster τexts further verified that the addition of PBB1-Cl or PBB2-Cl as the third component can effectively reduce charge recombination and promote charge extraction ability of the device.43
The molecular packing and morphology of the active layer are crucial for the construction of efficient ternary OSCs. In order to investigate the effect of PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl addition, 2D-GIWAXS images and corresponding line-cut profiles were obtained and are shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b), respectively. 2D-GIWAXS images of pure films are placed in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The PM6:Y6-BO-4Cl-based binary and ternary blend films show obvious (100) peaks of in-plane (IP) diffraction and out-of-plane (OOP) diffraction, which indicates that the films are arranged on face-on and edge-on arrangement.44 After adding PBB1-Cl or PBB2-Cl, the (100) peaks appeared at 0.29 Å−1 in IP diffraction and (010) peaks appeared at 1.71 Å−1 in OOP diffraction of the ternary blend films are improved, and indicated that the enhanced π–π stacking in the ternary blend films can be beneficial to the charge transmission, especially in PBB1-Cl-based ternary films. In addition, new weak (200) peaks appeared at 0.54 Å−1 and new stronger (300) peaks appearing at 0.84 Å−1 in both IP and OOP directions can be observed in the ternary blend films. All results indicate that more ordered molecular aggregation in the ternary blend films by adding different sidechain donors PBB1-Cl or PBB2-Cl as the third component, which can well explain the improved charge transfer and extraction.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) images are shown in Fig. 4(c) and (d), respectively. The root mean square roughness (Rq) of PM6:Y6-BO-4Cl, PM6:PBB1-Cl:Y6-BO-4Cl and PM6:PBB2-Cl:Y6-BO-4Cl blend films are 1.45,1.63 and 1.36 nm, respectively. The slight changes in roughness could be attributed to the influence of the third component on molecular packing and phase separation of the active layer. Interestingly, there was obvious adhesion between ternary blend films and the probe during the test. The AFM mechanical model test of the blend films was carried out, and the adhesion between the active layer and the probe was approximately obtained through the force curve, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The adhesion of PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl-based blend films are 1.26 × 10−6 N and 1.12 × 10−6 N, respectively, which is significantly greater than that of PM6:Y6-BO-4Cl (0.65 × 10−6 N) blend films, The difference of adhesion should be related to the special structure and stacking mode of PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl. In addition, the obvious nanofibers and bicontinuous interpenetrating networks of ternary blend films can be observed from TEM images, especially in PBB1-Cl based ternary blend films, which can be beneficial for the generation and extraction of charges in the ternary OSCs with improved JSC and FF.45
The influence of the third components with different side chains on the morphology of the active layer was further studied by density functional theory (DFT) calculation wb97xd/def2tzvp algorithm to gain insight into intermolecular interaction in the active layer.46 The repetitive units in polymers are selected to simplify molecular optimization and intermolecular interaction calculation of polymer materials. The long alkyl chains of PM6, Y6-BO-4Cl, PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl are replaced by methyl to simplify the algorithm. Optimized stacking structures of all individual donors and between host, and guest donors at the lowest energy steady state are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†) and Fig. 5(a), respectively. It can be seen that the interaction between host and guest donor molecules mainly comes from the intermolecular π–π stacking. This aggregation can afford 3D networks for efficient charge transport. The π–π stacking distance between PM6 and PBB1-Cl is about 3.57 Å, which is significantly less than the stacking distance between PM6 and PM6 (3.71 Å) or between PM6 and PBB2-Cl (4.14 Å). This phenomenon is mainly attributed to the absence of aromatic rings in the side chains of the acceptor unit in PBB1-Cl, which reduces the intermolecular steric hindrance. The more closely ordered molecular packing of PBB1-Cl and PM6 is beneficial to the entanglement of side chains between molecules, thus improving the spatial stability of the active layer.47 Interestingly, although the stacking distance between PBB2-Cl and PM6 is larger than the self-stacking distance of PM6, the π-overlapping area of PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl with PM6 is significantly longer than that the self π-overlapping area of PM6 due to the better planarity of PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl main chains (Table S5, ESI†), which should be conducive to the rapid charge transfer and tensile properties of the active layer.48,49 In addition, PM6 and PBB1-Cl show a slightly stronger interaction than PM6 and PBB2-Cl (−12.71 kcal mol−1vs. −9.44 kcal mol−1), which is attributed to the smaller intermolecular stacking distance between PBB1-Cl and PM6. The interaction between PM6 and PM6 is slightly stronger than that between PBB1-Cl or PBB2-Cl and PM6, which can be conducive for the maintenance of the stacking structure of PM6 in the blend film so that the addition of PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl can enhance the intermolecular aggregation and entanglement in the active layer on the basis of not destroying the self-stacking of PM6. The active layer molecular arrangement diagram can be a more intuitive description, as shown in Fig. 5(b). As we all know, holes in the active layer are mainly transported along the donor transport channel. In order to study the effect of the addition of the third components on hole transport, the reorganization energy (RE) and effective transfer integrals (ETIs) between the two polymer units have been calculated, as shown in Table S6 (ESI†). The hole REs between PBB1-Cl or PBB2-Cl and PM6 are 0.262 eV and 0.203 eV, which is less than that between PM6 and PM6 (0.284 eV). The smaller hole RE can be conducive to the hole transport. In addition, the ETIs between PBB1-Cl or PBB2-Cl and PM6 are −6.559 meV and −3.459 meV, which is significantly greater than that between PM6 and PM6 (0.502 meV). The charge transition probability is proportional to the square of the transfer integral. Therefore, the addition of the third component (PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl) can be conducive to improve hole mobility. In order to more intuitively analyze the influence of the third component with different side chains on the mechanical properties of the active layer, the in situ stress–strain and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements of PM6:Y6-BO-4Cl based binary and ternary blend films were subsequently performed.

The stress–strain curves of PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl based ternary blend films during stretching were measured as shown in Fig. 5(c). The tensile strength and elongation of PM6:Y6-BO-4Cl-based OSCs are 2.05 N and 5.83%. After the addition of 20% PBB1-Cl, the tensile strength and elongation at the break of the ternary blend film increased to 9.12 N and 26.86%. When 20% PBB2-Cl was added, the tensile strength and elongation at the break of the ternary blend film increased to 5.76 N and 16.99%. The significant increase of tensile strength and elongation of ternary blend films are attributed to the formation of better intertwined and ordered intermolecular stacking with the addition of the third component. To visually analyze the flexibility of the active layer, SEM images of the blend films with bending cycles 1000 times under the bending diameter of 10 mm and 3 mm were measured, as shown in Fig. 5(d). The PM6:Y6-BO-4Cl blend films clearly show interphase cracks with a bending diameter of 10 mm. After adding third components PBB1-Cl or PBB2-Cl, the fracture in PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl-based ternary blend films decreased significantly, especially the PBB1-Cl-based ternary blend film had no visible cracks after bending. The results are consistent with stress–strain curves and the calculation results. It is further confirmed that the addition of one-dimensional sidechain PBB1-Cl greatly reduces the steric hindrance and increases the π-overlapping area between molecules in the active layer, thus increasing the intermolecular entanglement to improve the flexibility and stretchability of the active layer.
The effect of the third component on the active layer is not only on the internal molecular packing and morphology but also on the interface between the active layer and the transport layer. In order to study the effect of PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl on the surface properties of the active layer, the contact angles of PEDOT:PSS, PDINO, binary and ternary blend films were measured as shown in Fig. 5(e). It can be seen that the CH2I2 contact angles of PM6:Y6-BO-4Cl-based binary and ternary blend films are almost the same, but the H2O contact angles of the optimized ternary blend films are slightly higher than that on the PM6:Y6-BO-4Cl-based binary blend film, which can be conducive to the wet stability of the active layer. In addition, γss of PEDOT:PSS, PDINO, PM6:Y6-BO-4Cl based binary and ternary blend films are 43.3, 38.0, 29.89, 31.9 and 30.7 mN m−1, respectively. The γss of the optimized ternary blend films are closer to that of the transport layer, which can reduce the contact resistance between different layers, thus improving the charge extraction ability of devices.50 In addition, the closer surface properties of the active layer and the transport layer can effectively reduce the possibility of interlayer separation, thus improving the mechanical stability of the device.
Based on the above research on the internal and surface characteristics of the active layer with the addition of a third component, the flexible OSCs with the structure of PEN/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINO/Al were prepared as shown in Fig. 6(a). The J–V curves of the flexible OSCs are shown in Fig. 6(b), and the corresponding device parameters are listed in Table S7 (ESI†). The PM6:Y6-BO-4Cl-based binary, PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl-based ternary OSCs are 13.44%, 14.96% and 14.47%, respectively. The efficiency of flexible OSCs is lower than that of rigid devices due to the lower transmittance of flexible substrate (Fig. S7, ESI†) and the more difficult to control film morphology. The Rshs and Rss of flexible devices show similar laws compared with rigid devices, which are conducive to the improvement of device FF. In addition, bending stability, bending cycles stability and thermal stability of the OSCs were measured in a high-purity nitrogen glove box (water oxygen content less than 0.1). As shown in Fig. 6(c), the efficiency of flexible OSCs decreases with the decrease of bending diameter. In contrast, the bending tolerance of flexible ternary OSCs is better than that of PM6:Y6-BO-4Cl based binary OSCs, especially PBB1-Cl-based flexible ternary OSCs. The improvement of flexibility ternary OSCs based on PBB1-Cl should be attributed to its more compact molecular packing and longer packing length, which promotes intermolecular entanglement. When the bending diameter decreases to 3 mm, the performance of all OSCs decreases rapidly, which can be interpreted as obvious cracks on the film surface caused by deformation fracture of substrate PET/ITO, as shown in Fig. 5(d).

The bending cycle performances of different OSCs under 10 mm bending diameters are shown in Fig. 6(d). The PBB1-Cl-based flexible ternary OSCs possess a more obvious cyclic bending stability, and they can still maintain 74% efficiency after 500 times bending, which is much higher than that of PM6:Y6-BO-4Cl-based binary (31%) and PBB2-Cl-based ternary (53%) flexible OSCs. The reason is that the addition of one-dimensional sidechain PBB1-Cl can regulate the stacking mode of active material, and increases the interchain winding of the material, thus improving the flexibility and stretchability of OSCs. The thermal stability of all OSCs was also measured as shown in Fig. 6(e). After annealing at 100 °C for 24 h, the PM6:Y6-BO-4Cl-based binary, PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl-based ternary OSCs can be maintained at 54%, 77% and 64%, respectively. The enhanced thermal stability of PBB1-Cl-based ternary OSCs is attributed to the addition of PBB1-Cl to reduce the temperature sensitivity of the active layer and enhance Tg (Fig. S8, ESI†). The Tg of PM6:PBB1-Cl:Y6-BO-4Cl blend systems is 204.5 °C, which is significantly higher than that of PM6:Y6-BO-4Cl blend systems (199.2 °C) and PM6:PBB2-Cl:Y6-BO-4Cl blend systems (200.8 °C). The enhanced Tg can be conducive to improve the thermal stability of the active layer. In addition, the absorption spectra of the blend films with annealing times at 100 °C were measured as shown from the data in Fig. S9 (ESI†). With the prolongation of heating time, the change in the absorption intensity of ternary blend films was smaller than that of the binary system, especially the PBB1-Cl-based ternary blend film, which indicates that the addition of PBB1-Cl can reduce the temperature sensitivity of the blend film, and further improve the thermal stability of the device.51
Conclusions
In summary, two different sidechain polymer donors PBB1-Cl and PBB2-Cl were investigated as the third component to improve the performance of OSCs. The PBB1-Cl-based rigid ternary OSCs achieved a PCE of 17.36% and the flexible OSCs achieved a PCE of 14.96%, which is significantly higher than the efficiency of binary and PBB2-Cl-based ternary OSCs. The performance improvement is mainly due to the optimized photon capture and morphology in the active layer to improve the charge generation and extraction. Internally, the better planarity and smaller steric hindrance of PBB1-Cl promote the intermolecular packing and entanglement in the active layer, resulting in a 4.6-fold (26.86%) increase in the tensile properties of PBB1-Cl based ternary blend films. Externally, the closer γss between the PBB1-Cl based ternary blend films and transport layers can reduce the possibility of separation between different layers. Furthermore, the higher Tg and the weaker absorption temperature sensitivity of the PBB1-Cl-based ternary blend films can be beneficial to improve thermal stability. As a result, the PCEs of PBB1-Cl-based flexible ternary OSCs are still above 74% within 500 cycles of bending with a diameter of 10 mm or annealing at 100 °C for 24 hours. All results show that intermolecular overlapping fasten packing has great potential in optimizing the morphology of the active layer to improve the photovoltaic performance, mechanical and thermal stability of OSCs.
