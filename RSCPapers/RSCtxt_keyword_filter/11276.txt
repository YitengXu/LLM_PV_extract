    , Accepted 31st January 2015First published on 3rd February 2015AbstractHarvest of near infrared (NIR) radiation in photovoltaic devices is highly desirable as it is recognized as a potential pathway to break the Shockley–Queisser limit of solar conversion efficiency. Here, (Y2O3:Yb–Er)/Bi2S3 composite films with photoactive current generation under NIR light excitation were fabricated by electro-deposition and a simple successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. The composite films consist of homogeneous crystalline particles of Y2O3 with a lamellar morphology covered by Bi2S3 nanoparticles. Upon excitation by a 980 nm laser, the Y2O3:Yb–Er layer in the composite film converts NIR photons into visible emissions through upconversion, which is absorbed by the covered Bi2S3 nanoparticles and leads to the generation of photoelectrons. With the use of a standard electrochemical cell where the composite film serves as the photoanode, we demonstrate robust photocurrent generation in aqueous solution. This study suggests a promising strategy for the harvesting of NIR radiation in solar cells, photocatalysts, and infrared photo-detectors.
1 Introduction
In recent years, hybrid structures have attracted growing interest due to their flexibility and extendable properties.1,2 Multicomponent hybrid materials containing two or more components often exhibit multiple functionalities far beyond those of the individual component, thus providing a promising strategy for nanoscale engineering of optoelectronic devices, photocatalysts and photovoltaic (PV) devices.3–8 Since the 20th century, the direct conversion of solar radiation to electric energy has become reality by solar cells based on semiconductors of different characteristics, such as silicon and TiO2. However, the semiconductor itself only absorbs light photons with energy higher than the band gap. In other words, solar radiation of sub-band gap energy, mostly near infrared (NIR) light, cannot be used and therefore do not contribute to photocurrent generation in PV devices.9–15 This fact has long limited the power conversion efficiency of conventional solar cells. Breaking this limit could be possible if new hybrid materials allow the efficient utilization of NIR radiation.
Recently, it was reported that the conversion efficiency of solar cells can be improved by adding an up-conversion (UC) layer at the rear face of a PV device.16–18 In these semiconductor–UC hybrid structures, the UC layer generates visible emissions which are then absorbed by the semiconductor and finally produce additional photocurrent. Rare earth (RE) ion activated inorganic compounds, such as oxides and fluorides, are often used as UC materials due to their bright emission and chemical robustness.19–21 In the UC phosphors activated with RE ions, such as Tm3+, Er3+, Ho3+, Nd3+, and Pr3+, UC emission covering the whole visible spectrum can be produced, and the combination of a UC phosphor and a semiconductor with an appropriate band gap would lead to the response to NIR light.
In order to fully absorb the visible UC emission from the RE ions, semiconductors with absorption edges in the UV or visible light (such as TiO2, CdS or CdSe) are excluded. The ideal choice seems to be again silicon which has a suitable band gap and is in fact the most popular semiconductor working in solar cells. However, silicon with high quality is not amenable to the wet chemistry process under ambient conditions due to its strong covalent bonding. Among different types of semiconductors, bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3) is a p-type semiconductor that absorbs almost the whole spectrum of visible light due to its small band gap around 1.3–1.7 eV (729–953 nm). Besides, Bi2S3 as a binary semiconductor with a lamellar structure has broad applications in solar cells, switching devices and thermoelectrics.22–30 Herein, Bi2S3 nanoparticles were combined with a UC phosphor of Y2O3:Yb–Er for the harvesting of NIR light. The hybrid structure was fabricated by an electro-deposition process, followed by a simple successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method for the deposition of Bi2S3 nanoparticles. We show that the (Y2O3:Yb–Er)/Bi2S3 film shows strong UC emission from Er3+, which leads to the photocurrent generation under NIR irradiation. The UC phosphor/semiconductor junction as well as the fabrication methodology demonstrated here may have strong implications in the design of a NIR-light harvesting PV device and the detection of NIR light.
The experimental setup as well as the energy transfer mechanism is briefly sketched in Fig. 1. In the fabrication process, the Y2O3:Yb–Er film was first deposited on the photoelectrode (ITO), then annealed at 600 °C for 2 hours, and finally covered by the SILAR process with a layer of Bi2S3 nanoparticles which serve as the absorber for visible and UV light. For the photocurrent measurement, a conventional three-electrode set-up was used, where the (Y2O3:Yb–Er)/Bi2S3 film, platinum foil and Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the working electrode (photoanode), counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. When irradiated by NIR light at 980 nm, green and red emissions are produced by the Yb–Er ion pair doped in the Y2O3 layer. Yb–Er codoped compounds have been widely employed for the generation of UC emissions in both bulk and nanoscale systems,31–33 where the Yb3+ ion serves as the sensitizer for the 980 nm light. Due to efficient sensitization by Yb3+, strong visible emissions around 563 nm and 661 nm are generated from the transitions of Er3+ ions by 2H11/2 + 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2, respectively (Fig. 1b). The visible UC emissions are then fully absorbed by the Bi2S3 layer, resulting in the injection of electrons into the ITO photoanode. Based on a photoelectrochemical process, this hybrid film efficiently converts NIR light into electrical energy. The generation of photocurrent by NIR light irradiation originates from the efficient excitation of Bi2S3 by the visible UC emissions, as shown in Fig. 1b.

2 Experimental
2.1 Thin film synthesis by electro-deposition
Thin films of Y2O3:Yb–Er were grown on indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass by an electro-deposition process and successive annealing as reported in ref. 34. In a typical process, different amounts of 99.99% purity Y(NO3)3, Yb(NO3)3 and Er(NO3)3 were dissolved in deionized water, respectively, to obtain 0.1 M solutions. These solutions were mixed with a volume ratio of VY(NO3)3:VYb(NO3)3:VEr(NO3)3 = X:Y:Z and the mixed solution was used as the precursor solution for electro-deposition. All samples were electro-deposited in a standard three-electrode cell, in which the working electrode was an ITO coated glass (sheet resistance: 20 Ω □−1, purchased from Xiangcity Technology Ltd., China), and a platinum foil and Ag/AgCl/saturated KCl were used as a counter electrode and a reference electrode, respectively. Each sample was deposited at 60 °C for 20 min. The applied potential was −1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl/saturated KCl. After the deposition, all the samples were cleaned and dried in air at 60 °C for 2 h, and then annealed at various temperatures (300 °C, 400 °C, 500 °C, 550 °C, 600 °C, 650 °C, and 680 °C) for 2.5 h in air.
The Bi2S3 film was prepared using a simple successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. First, 0.005 M Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (purity: 99%) solution and 0.008 M Na2S (purity: 98%) solution were prepared in separate glass beakers with deionized water. Secondly, the ITO glass was immersed in the Bi(NO3)3 solution for 10 s to absorb a large number of Bi3+ and NO3− ions. The weakly bound ions were removed by rinsing the substrate in deionized water for 15 s again. The absorbed Bi3+ ions reacted with S2− when the substrate was immersed in the Na2S solution for 10 s. Finally, the substrate was rinsed with deionized water for 15 s to dissolve the unreacted ions, leaving only the Bi2S3 nanoparticles in the substrate. Finally, the Bi2S3 film was dried at 60 °C in an oven for 30 min.

Scheme 1 is the schematic for the preparation of the (Y2O3:Yb–Er)/Bi2S3 composite films; the Y2O3:Yb–Er film was first deposited on the ITO substrate as described above, and then a Bi2S3 layer of varying thickness was coated onto the Y2O3:Yb–Er film by several cycles of the SILAR process.

2.2 Characterization
The crystal structures of the thin film samples were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a RIGAKU D/MAX 2550/PC system with Cu Kα radiation. The microstructures of the samples were examined with a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope. TG and DTA measurements were performed with TGA7 and DTA7 (Perkin Elmer Co. Ltd., USA) systems at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the films were recorded at room temperature on a Hitachi-4100 spectrophotometer. The UC luminescence of the samples was measured using a FLS920 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Edinburgh Instrument Ltd., U.K.) using a 980 nm laser diode (1 W) as the excitation. The photocurrent density was measured with a CHI 600C electrochemical station using the same three-electrode cell as described previously. Na2SO4 solution (0.5 M) was used as the electrolyte solution and a 980 nm laser diode (1 W) was employed as the NIR light source.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Structural properties
In our experiment, the Y2O3:Yb–Er thin films were prepared using a two-step process: electro-deposition and post-annealing process. The films show a dominant red UC emission at 661 nm from the transition 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 of Er3+ excited by a 980 nm laser diode (Fig. 4b and S4†). The UC emission intensity of the Y2O3:Yb–Er thin films is closely related to the crystal structure of the host material, doping concentration, deposition time, solution concentration and annealing temperature. The film deposited at 0.1 M concentration (20 min, solution with a nominal ratio of Y:Yb:Er = 96:3:1) and annealed at 600 °C (2.5 h) exhibits the strongest red UC emission (Fig. S7†). Thereafter, this Y2O3:Yb–Er thin film (deposited from the solution with Y:Yb:Er = 96:3:1) was covered with a layer of Bi2S3 nanoparticles by the SILAR process.
To study the formation of the Y2O3 film, the samples before and after annealing are shown in Fig. S2.† For the as-formed film and the films annealed at 300 °C, all the diffraction peaks can be assigned to Y2(OH)5.14(NO3)0.86·H2O (JCPDS: 32-1435). After annealing at 400 °C, 500 °C and 600 °C, the diffraction peaks assigned to Y2(OH)5.14(NO3)0.86·H2O disappear steadily, while new diffraction peaks from Y2O3 emerge (JCPDS: 01-76-8044). Fig. 2a shows that the peaks in the XRD patterns of the Y2O3:Yb–Er film can be all indexed to the cubic phase of Y2O3 (JCPDS: 01-76-8044), and no other phase can be identified except for the substrate ITO (JCPDS card no. 89-4597). Fig. S2a† and 3a show the cross-section and surface images of the Y2O3:Yb–Er thin film without annealing. The film shows a flaky-like surface morphology, and the thickness of the film is about 13.6 μm. After annealing at 600 °C for 2.5 h, the film thickness remains constant and the similar flaky-like surface morphology is almost preserved in spite of phase transition to pure Y2O3. From a closer observation, we can see that the sheet-like structure evolves into a lamellar structure, which may be ascribed to the decomposition of Y2(OH)5.14(NO3)0.86 and the formation of Y2O3, accompanied by the release of gases of H2O, NO2 and O2. This decomposition process is also evident in the thermogravimetry (TG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) curves of the Y2(OH)5.14(NO3)0.86·H2O film (Fig. S1†). In the composite film where Bi2S3 is deposited later onto the Y2O3 crystals, the characteristic diffraction peaks of only Bi2S3 and Y2O3 are detected (Fig. 2c), and the Bi2S3 nanoparticles formed on the flaky-like surface of the Y2O3:Yb–Er thin film are easily observed by SEM images (Fig. 3c and d). The diffraction peaks of the composite film are strongly reduced as compared to those of pure Y2O3 and Bi2S3 probably because the layer of Bi2S3 particles on the surface has lower crystallinity.

3.2 Photoluminescence properties

Fig. 4a shows the reflectance spectra of the Y2O3:Yb–Er thin film, Bi2S3 thin film, and the (Y2O3:Yb–Er)/Bi2S3 composite film. Due to the small absorption cross-section, the f–f transitions of RE ions are not observed in the spectrum of the Y2O3:Yb–Er film (Fig. 4a). For the Bi2S3 film, the absorption edge is found at around 950 nm, in agreement with its band gap of 1.3 eV. In comparison, the absorption edge of the (Y2O3:Yb–Er)/Bi2S3 composite film cannot be clearly located possibly due to its increased scattering, while it is clear that the whole visible region can be covered by the (Y2O3:Yb–Er)/Bi2S3 composite film.

(c) Up-conversion emission spectra of the composite film with different thicknesses of Bi2S3 (accessed by changing the number of cycles in the SILAR process). 
We then compare the UC emissions of the Y2O3:Yb–Er thin film with those of the (Y2O3:Yb–Er)/Bi2S3 composite film under NIR excitation by a 980 nm laser diode (Fig. 4b). Green emission bands observed at 531 to 571 nm are associated with the 2H11/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+, while the red band centered around 661 nm is associated with the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition. These visible emissions are produced as a result of efficient energy transfer from Yb3+ to Er3+, as shown in Fig. 1b. Different from the fluoride host, e.g. NaYF4,35 the red emission is overwhelming as compared to the green emission, implying that the difference in the phonon energy of the host plays an important role in the UC process. Similarly, dominating red emission is observed in Y2O3:Yb–Er nanoparticles, suggesting that the probability of phonon-assisted nonradiative relaxation from 2H11/2, 4S3/2 to 4F9/2 is much higher in oxide than that in fluoride.36 For the composite film, sharp reduction of both emissions (green and red) is observed in the (Y2O3:Yb–Er)/Bi2S3 composite film as compared to the Y2O3:Yb–Er film. Furthermore, the red light (661 nm) is weakened further with the increase of the thickness of Bi2S3 (accessed by changing the number of cycles in the SILAR process). In our experiment, the optimal number of cycles in the SILAR process to deposit Bi2S3 onto the Y2O3:Yb–Er film was found to be about 80 (Fig. 4c). This evidence confirms efficient quenching of the UC emission by Bi2S3 as a result of energy transfer from Y2O3:Yb–Er to Bi2S3. The energy transfer between these two layers is dominated by a radiative reabsorption process rather than a Föster–Dexter type, as the separation between most particles is far larger than the critical distance.
3.3 Photoelectrochemical measurements
As described previously (Fig. 1), the conversion of NIR photons to photoelectrons involves the excitation by NIR light, visible UC emissions from the Y2O3:Yb–Er thin film, absorption of visible light by the Bi2S3 film, and finally electron injection into ITO. The performances of the photoelectrochemical cell based on the different films deposited on the ITO photoanodes were evaluated with a standard three-electrode setup under excitation with a 980 nm laser diode. The influence of applied potential on the photocurrent response was investigated by cyclic voltammetry measurements in the potential range of −0.3 V to 0.3 V. Fig. 5a shows the photoelectrochemical behaviors of the (Y2O3:Yb–Er)/Bi2S3 composite film. The (Y2O3:Yb–Er)/Bi2S3 composite film shows a notable photocurrent under the 980 nm NIR laser excitation compared to the composite film measured in darkness (Fig. 5c), indicating the generation of photoelectrons by the excitation at 980 nm. The photocurrent is produced by Bi2S3 as a result of band transition that promotes electrons to their conduction band and the followed charge separation in the electrochemical cell. In comparison, the pure Y2O3 film and the Bi2S3 film do not show a meaningful photocurrent under both 980 nm excitation and in darkness (Fig. S8a and b†). This result therefore verifies the proposed energy transfer from Y2O3:Yb–Er to Bi2S3 (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 5  (a) Cyclic voltammetry potentiodynamic behaviors (i.e., I–V curves) of the (Y2O3:Yb–Er)/Bi2S3 composite film measurement in darkness (0 W) and under excitation by a 980 nm laser diode at 1 W. (b and c) Photocurrent response of the composite film at bias potentials of −0.3 V (b) and 0.3 V (c). 
To examine the contribution of thermal and scattering effects which may have a positive effect on the photon-current conversion, we prepared another composite film Y2O3/Bi2S3 without rare earth doping. As shown in Fig. S8c,† the I–V curves measured in the dark or under 980 nm excitation are almost the same for the composite film Y2O3/Bi2S3, suggesting that the contribution of the laser induced heating effect on the photocurrent is negligibly small. Furthermore, by comparing the I–V curves of Y2O3/Bi2S3 and pure Bi2S3, it becomes clear that the contribution of the scattering by Y2O3 particles can also be excluded.
To further confirm the NIR light response, we measured the photocurrent density curves of the (Y2O3:Yb–Er)/Bi2S3 film (80 cycles for SILAR for Bi2S3) under pulsed laser diode excitation. A negligible current is observed in darkness at a bias of 0.3 V probably due to surface side reactions. Under laser excitation, the photocurrent jumps to 22 μA, and the rectangular shape of the current–time curve suggests a fast light response. In comparison, a negative current (about −1.75 μA) was observed at an applied potential of −0.3 V in darkness and this current increases to about −5.9 μA when the cell is irradiated by the 980 nm laser diode. The fast NIR light response observed here again excludes the contribution of the thermal effect on the photocurrent generation.
4 Conclusions
In summary, we designed a (Y2O3:Yb–Er)/Bi2S3 composite film and fabricated it by electro-deposition and a simple successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. In this composite film, Y2O3:Yb–Er converts NIR light into visible photons that excite Bi2S3 and produce photoelectrons. With the use of an electrochemical cell, we successfully demonstrated highly photoactive current generation in a photoelectrochemical process driven by NIR irradiation. Combined with the high sensitivity and robust photocurrent generation under NIR light irradiation, the composite film (Y2O3:Yb–Er)/Bi2S3 demonstrated here may have potential applications in NIR photo-detectors and PV devices.
