Cyclic voltammetry studies revealed that the designed fullerene derivatives exhibit reduced electron affinity compared to the conventional material [60]PCBM. Organic bulk heterojunction solar cells based on pyrrolidinofullerenes and P3HT revealed impressive open-circuit voltages of 700–780 mV and enhanced light power conversion efficiencies with respect to reference PCBM/P3HT devices. The designed materials demonstrated reasonably good compatibility and decent photovoltaic performances in combination with a carbazole–thiophene–benzothiadiazole copolymer PCDTBT.
Introduction
Organic solar cells have been intensively investigated during the last decade in many research laboratories all over the world. Conjugated polymers (p-type) and fullerene derivatives (n-type) are usually used as semiconductor materials in organic solar cells. Design of novel electron donor conjugated polymers resulted in an increase in the solar light power conversion efficiency up to 10% and beyond.1 In contrast to conjugated polymers, much less attention is paid to the design of fullerene-based materials with improved electronic properties. Theoretical calculations have shown that the application of fullerene derivatives with reduced electron affinity can increase the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and, consequently, the efficiency of organic solar cells based on P3HT and the vast majority of other existing conjugated polymers.2 The electron affinity of fullerene sphere can be reduced by opening two or several double bonds in the carbon cage and attaching an appropriate number of addends. Indeed, organic solar cells based on biscycloadducts (e.g. bis-PCBM, ICBA) show 150–200 mV higher VOC's as compared to the reference devices comprising the classical [60]PCBM as an electron acceptor component.3–5 The main disadvantage of fullerene derivatives with two attached cyclic organic addends is their complex isomeric composition. The formation of complicated mixtures of ∼20 regio- and stereoisomers of biscycloadducts based on C60 and C70 creates considerable disorder in their thin films, inhibiting charge transport and badly affecting the photovoltaic performance of these materials.6 It is notable that biscycloadducts work well only in combination with crystalline polymers such as P3HT and PBDTBDD.3–13 The crystallization of the polymer during film formation also induces ordering of the fullerene phase. Furthermore, different isomers of biscycloadducts have rather different LUMO energies which induce energetic disorder in the material represented by a complex isomer mixture.14,15
Therefore, it is not surprising that the vast majority of highly promising low band gap conjugated polymers give insufficient solar cell performances in combination with biscycloadducts.16
Another family of fullerene-based materials with reduced electron affinity is represented by endohedral compounds such as Lu3N@C80-PCBH. Application of such materials in P3HT-based organic solar cells improved their open-circuit voltages and light power conversion efficiencies.17 However, further development and practical implementation of functionalized endohedral fullerene derivatives is limited by their extremely poor availability.18–20
The most promising and, at the same time, the least explored approach to lowering the electron affinity of the fullerene core is the attachment of a single organic addend loaded with electron donating substituents. The preparation and investigation of functionalized derivatives of [60]PCBM comprising multiple RO- or RS-substituents in the phenyl ring was reported previously.21 The synthesized compounds demonstrated an increase in VOC by ∼50 mV, while the efficiency of the photovoltaic cells was not improved. Furthermore, some examples of diphenylmethanofullerenes showed improved VOC in organic solar cells as compared to the conventional [60]PCBM.22–24 A number of silicon-containing 1,4-adducts of C60 and Diels–Alder-type cycloadducts with reduced electron affinity were also reported.25–27 Pyrrolidinofullerenes represent another promising family of fullerene derivatives with reduced electron affinity, demonstrating enhanced open circuit voltages and power conversion efficiencies in organic solar cells.28,29
The presented examples strongly suggest that fullerene monocycloadducts with reduced electron affinity represent a promising group of n-type materials for organic solar cells. However, their potential has not been explored sufficiently until now. In particular, to the best of our knowledge, none of the reported fullerene derivatives with reduced electron affinity showed decent photovoltaic performances with low crystallinity or amorphous conjugated polymers, e.g. PCDTBT.30
In the present work we pursued the design and investigation of a novel group of fullerene derivatives the electron affinity of which is lowered considerably due to the electron donating nature of a single organic addend attached to the fullerene cage.
Results and discussion
Here we explored the potential of the pyrrolidinofullerene core structure in the design of promising n-type semiconductor materials with lowered electron affinity as compared to the conventional [60]PCBM. First of all, it is known that the nitrogen atom donates its electron density to the fullerene cage thereby increasing its LUMO energy.31 Moreover, there are indications in the literature that substituents in the 2- and 5-positions of the pyrrolidine ring can interact directly with the fullerene cage.32 Additionally, a successful application of pyrrolidine type fullerene derivatives in organic solar cells was reported.28,29
The synthesis of the target fullerene derivatives F1–F5 required the preparation of N-alkylamino acids 3–4 by treatment of appropriate bromoacetic acids 1 and 2 with 2-ethyl-1-hexylamine as shown in Scheme 1.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of the fullerene derivatives F1–F5. 
The precursor 2-bromo-2-(2-methoxyphenyl)acetic acid 2 was synthesized by the bromination of 2-(2-methoxyphenyl)acetic acid with NBS in the presence of a catalytic amount of AIBN.
Pyrrolidinofullerenes F1–F4 and also the reference compound F5 were synthesized using a standard reaction based on the [3+2] cycloaddition of azomethine ylides to the fullerene cage.33 Compounds F1–F5 were isolated and purified by column chromatography. The high purity of the obtained products was confirmed by HPLC.
The compositions and molecular structures of the synthesized fullerene derivatives were revealed using the 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (Fig. S1–S12, ESI†). The NMR spectra revealed the formation of two stereoisomers of pyrrolidinofullerenes F1 and F3–F5 due to hindered nitrogen inversion. Pyrrolidinofullerene F2 was isolated as a mixture of 5 stereoisomers formed due to the cis–trans isomerism of the addends in the 2- and 5-positions of the pyrrolidine ring, their restricted rotation being due to the proximity of the bulky fullerene cage and also the hindered nitrogen inversion. These stereoisomers showed very similar characteristics which did not allow their separation and spectroscopic characterization as individual species. We would like to emphasize that each of the synthesized pyrrolidinofullerene F1–F5 represented a single regioisomer with a 58 π-electron system in the carbon cage (one double bond is opened and functionalized on the C60 sphere). Therefore, these compounds are isoelectronic with conventional [60]PCBM and differ significantly from biscycloadducts such as bis[60]PCBM or [60]ICBA.3,11–13,34–36
Cyclic voltammetry measurements were used for the investigation of the electrochemical properties of the designed fullerene derivatives. The cyclic voltammograms of pyrrolidinofullerenes F1–F5 exhibited three reversible reduction waves similar to that of [60]PCBM (Fig. 1 and Fig. S13, ESI†). However, the first reduction (half-wave) potentials were cathodically shifted with respect to [60]PCBM. The magnitudes of this shift were different for 1,2-disubstituted pyrrolidinofullerenes F1, F3, F4, F5 (20–70 mV) and 1,2,5-trisubstituted pyrrolidinofullerene F2 (80 mV, Table 1).

It is seen from Table 1 that fullerene derivatives F1–F4 have considerably higher LUMO energies with respect to [60]PCBM. Comparing the energy levels of some representative conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives (Fig. 2) suggests that the solar cells comprising F1–F4 instead of [60]PCBM can show enhanced open circuit voltages and overall light power conversion efficiencies.
 Fig. 2  Energy level diagram for P3HT, PCDTBT, F2 and [60]PCBM showing the highest occupied (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied (LUMO) molecular orbitals of the materials. 
We believe that the observed decrease in the electron affinity of the designed fullerene derivatives F1–F4 is related to the through-space electronic interactions between the lone pair electrons of the pyrrolidine nitrogen atom and the fullerene cage and also to similar interactions involving the alkoxy groups (electron lone pairs of O) introduced to the phenyl substituents in close proximity to the fullerene cage. For instance, reference compound F5 comprising no methoxy groups demonstrates lower electron affinity as compared to PCBM (effect of the pyrrolidine nitrogen) but it is still higher in comparison with F1–F4 loaded with a different number of methoxy groups. It is notable that compounds F1 and F2 with the lowest electron affinity possess two and three methoxy groups at the 2′- and 6′-positions of the phenyl substituents in the pyrrolidine ring, respectively.
It is known that the charge transport properties of organic semiconductors significantly affect their photovoltaic performance in devices. In particular, a vast majority of fullerene bisadducts bearing two cyclic addends randomly distributed on the fullerene cage demonstrate inferior electron transport characteristics. In contrast, the fullerene derivatives designed in this work comprise a single pyrrolidine-type addend with a well-defined addition pattern to the fullerene cage. However, the existence of some stereoisomerism in the structures of F1–F4 might also affect their charge transport characteristics. SCLC mobility measurements were performed for the designed compounds and the reference fullerene derivatives [60]PCBM and bis[60]PCBM using electron-only diode devices ITO/Ca/fullerene derivative/Ca/Ag. The obtained results (Table 1) suggest that the fullerene derivatives F1–F4 have rather good electron mobilities which are similar (F2–F3) or even considerably higher (F1, F4) as compared to [60]PCBM. In contrast, fullerene biscycloadducts (e.g. bis[60]PCBM) represented by complicated mixtures of isomers demonstrate one order of magnitude lower mobility with respect to [60]PCBM. These results proved that it is possible to achieve the desired reduction in the electron affinity of the fullerene cage while maintaining good charge transport characteristics of the resulting materials.
The designed pyrrolidinofullerenes F1–F4 were investigated as n-type components of organic bulk heterojunction solar cells in combination with the conjugated polymers P3HT and PCDTBT (Fig. 3a). We would like to emphasize that we utilized the inverted device configuration (Fig. 3b) to exclude any possible unfavorable interactions between the pyrrolidinofullerenes and the acidic hole transport layer PEDOT:PSS. The inverted solar cell architecture comprised a semitransparent ITO electrode modified with a thin (3 nm) layer of ytterbium collecting the electrons, a photoactive fullerene-polymer blend (60–150 nm) and a MoO3 (3 nm)/Ag (100 nm) hole-collecting electrode. The photoactive composite films were deposited by spin-coating from chlorobenzene (in the case of P3HT) and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (when using PCDTBT) solutions at different spinning frequencies. The polymer:fullerene derivative ratios were also varied from 1:1 to 1:4 in order to find the optimal device fabrication conditions. The obtained results are presented in Table 2.

The light-on J–V characteristics of the fabricated solar cells based on different material combinations are shown in Fig. 4.

It is notable that organic solar cells comprising fullerene derivatives F1–F4 demonstrate strongly increased open circuit voltages as compared to the reference devices with [60]PCBM. We would like to emphasize that the open circuit voltage of 772 mV achieved for the F2/P3HT system is even higher than the value obtained for the bis[60]PCBM/P3HT devices (724 mV, see ref. 3). The solar cells comprising pyrrolidinofullerenes F1–F4 and P3HT as a donor polymer demonstrated enhanced power conversion efficiencies in comparison with the reference [60]PCBM/P3HT cells.
We have also shown that pyrrolidinofullerenes can be successfully used as electron acceptor components in solar cells with push–pull donor–acceptor copolymers such as PCDTBT. In particular, the devices comprising F3 and F4 in combination with PCDTBT showed high open circuit voltages of 960–980 mV and reasonable power conversion efficiencies exceeding 4% (Table 2). It should be emphasized that pyrrolidinofullerenes F3 and F4 represent virtually the first fullerene derivatives with reduced electron affinity showing decent photovoltaic performances in combination with amorphous conjugated copolymers such as PCDTBT. The data provided in Table 2 suggest that the dramatically reduced fill factor limits the photovoltaic performance of the F3/PCDTBT and F4/PCDTBT blends. It is possible that the unbalanced fullerene–polymer blend morphology is responsible for the observed low fill factors. The AFM images shown in Fig. 5 do not reveal a strong phase separation between the donor and the acceptor components of the blend. Moreover, the F3/PCDTBT and F4/PCDTBT composite films showed a rather featureless morphology, which is an indication of too strong intermixing between the donor and acceptor components. Therefore, it is very likely that insufficient phase separation between the fullerene derivatives and PCDTBT prevents the formation of efficient percolation pathways required for delivering photogenerated charges towards the respective electrodes. We believe that the morphology problems are even more severe in the case of F1/PCDTBT and F2/PCDTBT blends delivering worse photovoltaic performances (Table S1, ESI†).
 Fig. 5  AFM images of thin films of F1/P3HT (a), F2/P3HT (b), F3/PCDTBT (c) and F4/PCDTBT (d) blends. 
At the same time, we have shown that pyrrolidinofullerenes F1–F4 quench the photoluminescence of PCDTBT in thin films with virtually the same efficiency as [60]PCBM (Fig. S15 and S16, ESI†). This observation suggests that the lowered electron affinity of F1–F4 does not prevent efficient charge separation in their blends with PCDTBT. Therefore, inefficient charge collection due to an unbalanced active layer morphology seems to be the main factor limiting the performance of the pyrrolidinofullerene/PCDTBT solar cells.
Our future research efforts will be aimed at overcoming the morphology issues revealed here for pyrrolidinofullerenes F1–F4. In particular, designing novel compounds capable of efficient self-assembling in thin films and/or undergoing stronger segregation from the polymer will be pursued.
Conclusions
Four novel 1,2-disubstituted and 1,2,5-trisubstituted pyrrolidinofullerenes loaded with electron donor methoxy groups have been synthesized and systematically investigated. It has been shown that the introduction of methoxy groups in close proximity to the carbon cage results in a noticeable decrease in its electron affinity, presumably due to direct through-space electronic interactions between the lone pair electrons of the oxygen atoms and the fullerene π-system.
The application of the designed pyrrolidinofullerenes as electron acceptor components of organic solar cells resulted in a significant improvement of the device open circuit voltages as compared to the reference systems comprising conventional [60]PCBM. In particular, a VOC of 772 mV achieved for the F2/P3HT blends represents one of the highest values ever reported for fullerene monocycloadducts. These findings prove that pyrrolidinofullerenes undoubtedly are promising n-type materials with reduced electron affinity.
The light power conversion efficiencies of the solar cells comprising pyrrolidinofullerenes were somewhat higher or equal to the parameters of the reference [60]PCBM-based devices. Unfortunately, the enhanced VOC was counterbalanced by reduced fill factors, related, most probably, to the unbalanced active layer morphology. Overcoming this obstacle by modifying the molecular structures of the pyrrolidinofullerenes and tailoring their physical properties (e.g. solubility) might lead to the development of a novel generation of fullerene-based n-type materials for highly efficient organic photovoltaics.
Experimental
Synthesis
The synthetic procedures and spectral data are provided in the ESI.†
Cyclic voltammetry measurements
Cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed for ∼1 × 10−3 M solutions of the fullerene derivatives in a 1,2-dichlorobenzene/DMF (3:2) solvent mixture using a cell equipped with a glassy carbon working electrode (2 mm2), a platinum wire as a counter electrode and a standard Ag/Ag+ as a pseudo reference electrode. The scan rate was 50 mV s−1. A 0.1 M solution of Bu4NPF6 was used as a supporting electrolyte.
Fabrication of inverted photovoltaic devices
Cleaned and patterned ITO glass (see ref. 37) was modified with 3 nm of Yb deposited by thermal evaporation in a vacuum. P3HT (15 mg) or PCDTBT (6 mg) and the corresponding amount of the fullerene derivative (following the optimal weight ratios given in Table 2) were dissolved together in 1 mL of chlorobenzene (P3HT) or 1,2-dichlorobenzene (PCDTBT) with the addition of 11 mg of silica (ACROS Organics 40-60 A). The resulting polymer–fullerene blend solutions were filtered through a 0.45 μm PTFE syringe filter and spin-coated at 1200 rpm for 40 s (P3HT) or at 800 rpm for 140 s (PCDTBT) on the Yb-modified ITO slides. The deposited films were annealed in an argon glove box under the conditions specified in Table 2. The top electrode comprising 3 nm of MoO3 and 100 nm of Ag was deposited by thermal evaporation.
Characterization of photovoltaic devices
The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the devices were obtained in the dark and under simulated 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5 solar irradiation provided by a KHS Steuernagel solar simulator integrated in a MBraun glove box. The intensity of the illumination was checked every time before the measurements were taken using a calibrated silicon diode with a known spectral response. The I–V curves were recorded in an inert atmosphere using a Keithley 2400 source-measurement unit. The active areas of all devices were measured with good accuracy just after the J–V measurements to estimate the short circuit current densities.
SCLC mobility measurements
The electron-only diodes were fabricated using the following procedure. A thin film (15 nm) of Yb was evaporated on cleaned ITO glass. Then a solution of a fullerene derivative in PhCl–CHCl3 (1:4 v/v) was spin-coated at different spinning rates (from 100 to 1600 rpm) in order to provide a set of film thicknesses ranging typically from 80 to 700 nm. The diode structure was completed by evaporation of 100 nm of Ca and 100 nm of Al on top of the fullerene layer. The current–voltage characteristics of the fabricated diodes were recorded inside a nitrogen glove box (MBraun) using a Keithley 2400 source-measurement unit. The thicknesses of the films were determined by making scratches near the corresponding electrodes and profiling them using a NTEGRA PRIMA microscope (NT-MDT, Russia) operating in a contact mode. The obtained data were analysed according to the standard space charge limited current (SCLC) model. The SCLC mobility depended on the active layer thickness (due to interface effects, in particular) approached the maximal values at 200–400 nm. The highest reproducible values are provided in Table 1.
