    , Accepted 4th August 2016First published on 4th August 2016AbstractPhotosynthetic proteins, such as light-harvesting complex II (LHCII), possess an excellent ability to harvest solar energy by means of highly efficient energy conversion. Here, we have prepared novel nano-bio hybrids by employing Ag nanoparticles as surface plasmons to couple with LHCII for optical enhancement in organic photovoltaics for the first time. And we have demonstrated that the incorporation of suitable Ag nanoprisms into nano-bio hybrids not only expands the absorption region through light trapping, but also enhances the photon-absorbing activity of molecular photosensitizers through localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) from the nanoprisms. The increased light absorption that results in enhanced photocurrent enables universal optical enhancement for multiple bulk heterojunction systems with maximum PCE up to 10.88%. We expect that our strategy for the construction of nano-bio hybrids through integration of metal nanostructures and photosynthetic biomolecules can provide a powerful and general means to enhance broad-band light harvesting in solar energy conversion applications.
Introduction
All solar energy conversion processes begin with light absorption by photo-sensitizers and then the electronic excitation is transferred to a specific electron acceptor.1 In natural photosynthesis, photosynthetic membrane protein complexes ensure strong light absorption and effective energy transport to reaction centers with high efficiency within extremely fast equilibration times (femtosecond level).2 As the most abundant membrane protein on Earth, and because of its high efficiency in absorbing and transferring solar energy,3,4 the LHCII molecule is considered as a promising unit for applications in molecular optoelectronics.5 Currently there is enormous interest in trying to mimic photosynthetic systems to collect and utilize solar radiation by using LHCII molecules.6,7 However, issues that have to be considered when thinking of how to design such supramolecular building blocks concern the character of the materials, their mutual organization, their electronic coupling, their reorganization energies and the surrounding matrix.
An alternative strategy is to take advantage of existing functional photosynthetic proteins as building blocks for the development of novel, nano-bio light-harvesting units in photovoltaic devices,8,9 especially for cells limited by insufficient light absorption, such as organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs).10,11 Our previous studies12 showed that LHCII could act as an effective photosensitizer for photocurrent enhancement through energy transfer. However, to date, few studies have presented direct experimental demonstration of the absorption enhancement in devices using large biomolecular objects.13 LHCII complexes are bulky poor conductors and this might be attributed to the nonohmic contact with the electrode for a thicker LHCII modification layer14 (Fig. S1†), while a single protein monolayer absorbs a relatively small portion (∼1%) of the sunlight. Moreover, LHCII molecules are incapable of efficiently absorbing photons across the visible region (Fig. 1), which would prevent the realization of broad spectrum absorption enhancement.

Coupling such photocatalytic systems with metallic nanoparticles that exhibit strong LSPR is considered to be a promising strategy.15,16 Unlike these natural sensitizers, the optical spectra of metallic nanostructures are systematically tunable via changes in sizes, shapes and the dielectric environment of the metal nanoparticles.17,18 And the intense local electric fields induced by collective electron oscillation in metals upon resonant excitation can enhance the total number of excitons created in adjacent photoactive species.19,20 Previously, we have demonstrated that embedding various silver nanoprisms in interfacial layers can achieve a tailorable light absorption enhancement region associated with plasmon resonance bands.21,22 Moreover, the surface plasmon effect of metal nanoparticles offers advantages for acting as an optical antenna to enhance the photosynthetic protein light absorption over the entire absorption spectrum due to efficient electromagnetic coupling between the proteins and metal nanoparticles.23,24 Although the optical enhancement in the hybrid system has been observed in the theory model and even in the solution state, immobilizing the photosynthetic biomolecules in photovoltaic devices is more challenging for realistic device applications due to concerns of colloidal stability and precise fabrication management.25–27 The primary principle in achieving plasmon-enhanced light harvesting lies in the precise choice of metallic nanostructures and photosensitizers since different behavior of the energy transfer interaction is strongly dependent on the electronic structures of organic molecules and nanostructure geometries.28
Here, we present a simple and versatile approach for the construction of plasmonic metal/photosensitizer nano-bio hybrids for broad-band light harvesting by mixing silver nanoprisms (Ag NPs) with natural sensitizer LHCII. As illustrated in Scheme 1, the nano-bio hybrids are incorporated between the electron transporting layer (ZnO) and active layers, and display multiple advances: (1) confirmative broad-band optical absorption enhancement and a consequent photocurrent increase from the complementary contribution of Ag NPs and LHCII; (2) enhanced light harvesting from the protein complex induced by the plasmonic field of Ag NPs; (3) excellent compatibility of our strategy with multiple state-of-the-art organic absorber systems. These advances allow us to report an appreciable enhancement in light harvesting associated with the optical effects resulting in a significant improvement in PCE over 10%. We expect that a diverse range of metallic nanostructure and natural molecule combinations are possible to facilitate the design flexibility of nano-bio hybrids in solar energy conversion applications.

Results and discussion
The absorption spectra measured at room temperature are presented in Fig. 1, with an absorption maximum at 675 nm (Qy region) and a peak at 436 nm (Soret region).2 The silver nanoprisms used in this work were synthesized following a thermally induced synthesis method and denoted as Ag-λ,29 where λ indicates the corresponding LSPR peak position in solution. In this study, we focus on the incorporation of spectrally tunable silver nanoprisms (Fig. S2†) for complementary absorption. Therefore, nanoprism Ag-530 (∼40 nm edge length, Fig. S3†), featuring an extinction maximum at 530 nm in water, is chosen in this work. In addition to the size effects, the LSPR peaks of Ag nanoprisms are also strongly correlated with the surrounding dielectric environments.30 In this study, the hybridization of the blends is called Ag-530/LHCII for short unless further notice. Incorporation into LHCII causes a red shift to 575 nm due to its larger refractive index (naverage ∼ 1.5). The mutual complementary absorption feature results in broadband photon harvesting of Ag-530/LHCII hybrids even at wavelengths where the LHCII molecules have weak absorption activity.
To investigate the influence of nano-bio hybrid incorporation on the device performance, we chose our state-of-the-art ladder-type donor polymer poly(indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene-difluorobenzothiadiazole) (PIDTT-DFBT)31 (Scheme 1) and the [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) acceptor as a BHJ layer, and used ZnO as an electron-selective layer. The typical inverted device configuration ITO/ZnO/SAM/Interlayer/PIDTT-DFBT:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag is employed,32 in which a fullerene self assembly monolayer (C60-SAM)33 is used as a control and 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APS)7,9 is utilized to provide electrostatic interactions for the protein complex. Besides the optical changes, we further studied the surface morphology of the hybrid interlayers by AFM using a tapping mode in Fig. 2. In the case of a nanoprism-coated ZnO film, the Ag NPs exhibited obvious aggregation with large root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 4.97 nm (Table S1†); while the smooth surface morphology of the hybrid interlayer with a RMS roughness of 2.67 nm indicated that the plasmonic NPs were readily dispersed within LHCII (Fig. S4†). Combined with the invariable absorption spectrum in the solid state (Fig. 1B), we found that the modification of APS enables the better assembly of LHCII onto the ZnO/APS substrate without denaturation (Fig. S5†) through electrostatic interactions between the cationic surface of the electrode and the anionic stromal side of the LHCII polypeptide.7

To clarify the functions of nano-bio hybrids in OPV devices, we first optimized the solar cell performance with Ag NPs and LHCII separately, and then we investigated the cooperative effect of hybrids. The corresponding current density versus voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 3A, and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Table S2,† we used different concentrations of LHCII and Ag NP solutions to deposit on top of the ZnO cathode for investigating the influence of the interlayer film thickness. These reference ZnO devices show an average PCE of 6.26% (Table 1) and their relatively poor performance can mostly be attributed to the surface traps on the ZnO surface, which result in significant charge recombination on the interface. To eliminate the concern of defects associated with trap states, we used C60-SAM for post-processing modification/passivation of the ZnO.34 The C60-SAM control device shows reasonable device performance with short-circuit current density (JSC) of 12.37 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.97 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.62, and an average PCE value of 7.40%.

It was expectable to note that devices with incorporation of bare Ag NPs presented decreased performance (Fig. S6†) since the non-radiative exciton quenching and charge recombination would occur on the surface.35 In the meanwhile, the incorporation of a thin LHCII modification layer could slightly improve the JSC values from 12.37 to 13.05 mA cm−2 in inverted solar cells. After that, we studied the effect of nano-bio hybrids by mixing Ag NPs and LHCII together under optimized conditions. Very interestingly, devices with Ag-530/LHCII hybrids show much better solar cell performance and JSC further improved to 14.46 mA cm−2, resulting in a promising PCE of 8.94%, while the VOC and FF are almost fixed at 0.98 V and 0.63, respectively. It indicates that the presence of LHCII surfactants acting as shell coatings prevents the undesirable exciton quenching from happening in metal NPs. Moreover, the LSPR effect from the nanoprisms would enhance the photon-absorbing activity of molecular photosensitizers. The integrated JSC values from external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are consistent with the photocurrent enhancement. The small standard deviations indicate the good reliability and reproducibility of the results. More importantly, the relative enhancement of 20.8% of the hybrid system, even compared to that of the control device, with the maximum power conversion efficiency (9.39%) is unprecedented for an optical strategy in OPVs (Table S3†).36,37
For the illustration of JSC enhancement, we investigated the changes in absorption by performing reflectance measurements with different interlayers. Compared with the control devices using fullerene SAM, introducing a protein complex into devices restrain the reflectivity in the region where LHCII molecules have high absorption activity. And the nano-hybrid devices exhibit the lowest light reflectivity in the whole visible region. The absorption enhancements are also confirmed by the corresponding UV-vis absorption spectrum of active layer films (Fig. S8†). As shown in Fig. 3C, we calculated the device absorption (A) from diffuse reflection (R) and transmission (T), using A = 1 − R − T, assuming that the thick Ag back-electrode serves as a mirror fully reflecting all the incoming light (T = 0).38 To evaluate the light-trapping within the device, we compared the enhanced absorption (ΔA) and EQE (ΔEQE) of the Ag-530/LHCII devices in Fig. S9.† As can be seen, the ΔEQE spectrum has three peaks at wavelengths of 450, 580 and 670 nm, which are consistent with the peaks in the ΔA spectrum. Importantly, the presence of the additional peak of Ag NPs in the spectrum verifies that the plasmon resonances of the metallic nanostructures can be independently adjusted to the optical properties of the biocomponents for broad-band absorption enhancement.
The very small variations of VOC and FF for different types of devices suggest that the incorporation of an interlayer poses little influence on the electrical properties of these devices. The unchangeable rectification ratio obtained from the dark J–V characteristics (Fig. S10†), invariable electron mobility (Fig. S11†) and work function for the modified ZnO surface (Fig. S12†) further confirm the similar electrical properties in all the devices. Meanwhile, the invariable internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of all the devices suggests that the increase of absorbed photons is the main cause of photocurrent enhancement. We first performed optical simulations (Fig. S13†) based on the transfer matrix method (TMM)39 to elucidate the optical interference effect caused by the incorporation of a nano-bio hybrid interlayer. And the slight drop of Jph-100%IQE from 14.92 (control device) to 14.77 mA cm−2 (hybrid device) eliminates the concern of an optical spacer in our interlayer insertion. Then we calculated the saturation current density (Jsat) and maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax) of the devices to further quantify the optical effects on exciton generation.40Fig. 4A reveals the dependence of photocurrent density (Jph) on the effective voltage (Veff). The Gmax of the control device and Ag-530/LHCII device is 1.04 × 1028 m−3 s−1 (Jsat = 142 A m−2) and 1.22 × 1028 m−3 s−1 (Jsat = 166 A m−2), respectively. The enhancement of Gmax (17%) is consistent with our average JSC enhancements, which confirms the increasing absorption of incident photons in our devices incorporated with nano-bio hybrids. In addition, Fig. 4B displays the dependence of the incident light intensity on the photocurrent and yielded similar exponential factors (s) of around 0.96. The linear dependence of JSC on the incident light intensity suggests the absence of bimolecular recombination.41 Therefore, we have proved that embedding the nano-bio interfacial layers can significantly improve the photo-generation of excitons, but has a negligible impact on the charge recombination process.

In order to understand the optical effects of our nano-bio hybrids, we performed steady state photoluminescence (PL) measurements (Fig. 4C) by recording the fluorescence spectra of PIDTT-DFBT films deposited on different substrates. For the spectra of PIDTT-DFBT films on a pure LHCII layer, we have observed an enhancement of intensity by around 20% with the appearance of the LHCII emission peak (680 nm). The energy transfer between LHCII and PIDTT-DFBT is proved by the PL quenching of a pure LHCII film (Fig. S14A†). Upon the addition of PIDTT-DFBT, the emission maximum of the donor fluorescence at 680 nm drops by about 75%. And the integrated PL intensity of the plasmonic sample is enhanced by around 30% with respect to the pristine polymer film. We attribute the primary enhanced PL intensity to the fact that the LSPR effects, induced by the Ag NPs, enhanced light collection and thereby, enhance the light excitation rate through local field enhancement.42 Surprisingly, a more pronounced increasing PL intensity is found in the donor polymer film above nano-bio hybrids, displaying an enhancement factor over 70%. The additional enhancement factor implies efficient electromagnetic coupling between plasmonic nanoprisms and photosensitizers in the Ag-530/LHCII film, which would enhance the light harvesting adjacent to the surface of metal nanoparticles. To better understand the plasmon coupling in the hybrids, we compared the distributions of the fluorescence response from LHCII and Ag-530/LHCII films in Fig. 4D. The bare LHCII films yield a distribution of the relative intensities with a mean value of 1.0 (by definition of average intensity Iave, Fig. S14†); while the distribution of hybrid films shifts to higher intensities with a mean of 2.04. These results confirm that the plasmon-induced amplification of the electromagnetic fields is effective for nanoparticles that are embedded in a protein matrix. We further constructed a theoretical model of the electric fields by the FDTD method. As shown in Fig. 5A, the enhanced electric field is extended into the surrounding medium by tens of nanometers, which may greatly improve the light absorption of the LHCII and active layer. Our results demonstrate that the incorporation of Ag-530/LHCII nano-bio hybrids is an efficiently plasmon-enhanced light-trapping approach, as shown in the schematic representation of Fig. 5A.

Comparison of the J–V characteristics of the control device and the devices with LHCII or the Ag-530/LHCII hybrid layer for PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM (B) and PTB7-Th:PC71BM (C) systems. 
After validating that the enhancements are consistent with the optical effects, the incorporation of nano-bio hybrids might be considered as a universal light-absorption enhancement strategy. We employed the Ag-530/LHCII hybrids in other high-performance absorber materials, namely PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM43 and PTB7-Th:PC71BM44 systems. Compared with the irregular packing patterns of ladder-type polymer PIDTT-DFBT, both PBDT-DTNT and PTB7-Th have stronger intermolecular packing with crystalline aggregation in their corresponding morphologies. Fig. 5B and C show the J–V curves of devices incorporated with various interlayers, and Table 1 presents the photovoltaic parameters of the cells. Devices with fullerene SAM for surface modification are still used as the control structure. Benefiting from the Ag-530/LHCII hybrids, the average PCE of the PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM device is substantially improved from 7.32% to 8.92% (21.4% enhancement), and the average PCE of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM device is significantly improved from 9.03% to 10.57% (17.5% enhancement). Again, for both polymer systems, the increasing photocurrent is the primary reason for the performance improvement. Notably, we have achieved the highest PCE of 10.88% for the PTB7-Th:PC71BM device using the nano-bio hybrids, which compares favorably with or exceed champion solar cell PCEs as in previously reported work. The EQE spectra (Fig. S15†) show similar optical enhancements for both absorber systems, matching well with our results of the PIDTT-DFBT devices. Importantly, these results generalize the applicability of our nanohybrids as a powerful optical engineering technique to enhance the performance of a wide range of absorber material systems.
Conclusions
In summary, we have created original nano-bio hybrids by mixing extinction-tailorable silver nanoprisms (Ag-530) with natural photosensitizing LHCII, allowing the Ag-530/LHCII hybrids to harvest broad-band photons. Additionally, the plasmonic metal NPs incorporated into the light harvesting complex significantly enhance the activity of light absorption of LHCII molecule field enhancement by the LSPR of Ag NPs. We have showed that incorporation of hybrids as an interlayer provided efficient optical engineering generally compatible with a broad range of absorber materials. Both the results of device measurements and optical spectroscopy demonstrate that the resulting increases in photocurrent are consistent with enhanced optical absorption in the device, which are attributed to both the plasmonic light trapping from Ag NPs and the energy transfer from LHCII. Utilizing the remarkable absorption enhancements induced by nano-bio hybrids, we successfully improved the PCE to a very high value of 10.88%, with relative enhancement around 20%. The hybridization approach provides an effective and innovative platform to attain nanoscale architectures integrated with plasmonic metallic nanostructures and bio-sensitizers with desired light harvesting for optical management in solar cells.
