    , Accepted 13th February 2016First published on 15th February 2016AbstractDihybrid (GP) and trihybrid (GPPS) hydrogels constructed by 5,5′-(1,3,5,7-tetraoxopyrrolo[3,4-f]isoindole-2,6-diyl)diisophthalic acid (P), graphene oxide (GO) and P, GO, and PEDOT:PSS are studied. The gelation occurs through H-bonding and π–π stacking interactions. A magnificent improvement occurs in the mechanical properties of the hybrid gels compared to the P gel. The dc-conductivity of GPPS xerogels is 4–5 orders of magnitude higher compared to the GP and P xerogels. The current–voltage (I–V) characteristic curves of the GP and GPPS gels exhibit rectification properties with the highest rectification ratio of 61; however, the xerogels exhibit semiconducting nature. The GP and GPPS xerogels exhibit photoresponse behavior, and the on–off cycles display a stable photocurrent for the latter system. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are fabricated taking the GPPS gels as active materials and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) increases with the increase of PEDOT:PSS concentration showing a maximum PCE of 4.5%. The IPCE curve shows an absorption range of 360–700 nm with the maximum absorbance of ∼57%. Impedance spectroscopy indicates a considerable difference in the Nyquist plots between the xerogels and gels; the latter exhibit a semicircle with an additional spike corresponding to the Warburg impedance. The Cole–Cole plot of the DSSC consists of three semicircles and the equivalent resistance–capacitance circuits elucidate the PCE values.
1. Introduction
In the present century scientists are relentlessly trying to develop interesting smart materials which elicit the advancement of civilization. Hybrid soft materials (gels) play as protagonists in the family of functional materials as they are endowed with interesting material properties.1–7 These hybrid soft materials are engineered by integrating surfactants, polymers, nanoparticles, etc. with gelator molecules, thereby augmenting the physical and mechanical properties of the parent gels.8–13 Recently, conductive gels have risen as potential functional materials due to their versatile applications in fuel cells, supercapacitors and rechargeable lithium batteries.14–16 They are often engineered by polymerizing monomers of a conducting polymer within a non-conducting gel matrix.7,17–22 Other methods include, adding conductive particles to the gel matrix,23 producing gels from conducting polymers23–26 or mingling conducting polymers into the network structure of the gels.27,28 Hybrid gels derived from conducting polymers unite the gel properties with the optical and electronic properties of semiconductors creating a three-dimensional network which not only yields interesting optical properties but also facilitates the transport of charge carriers and molecules giving rise to various properties e.g. rectification, electronic memory, photovoltaic properties, supercapacitance, etc.18,19,29,30 Also the electronic properties are found to be different in the gel and xerogel states e.g. the latter exhibits the characteristics of a semiconductor–metal junction and the former exhibits negative differential resistance (NDR) combined with rectification properties in the hybrid gel of a naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride derivative and polyaniline.19
To meet the overwhelming demand of energy for the progress of civilization, new renewable and sustainable sources of energy are indispensable. Harvesting solar energy is a splendid solution to this problem as solar energy is the most convenient alternative resource of energy. Plenty of techniques are employed for effectively harvesting solar energy.31,32 A variety of materials are utilized to fabricate efficient solar cells including organic dyes, conducting polymers, semiconducting metal nanoparticles, nanodots, nanocarbon materials, etc.32–38 Conductive gels with fine electronic properties can be potential candidates in this context. The optoelectronic properties of the supramolecular gels are different in sol and gel phases and they can also be tuned by external stimuli. So the self-assembled π-gelators can be applicable as organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and in organic solar cells (OSCs), etc.39–44 A hybrid gel of the n-type semiconducting perylene bisimide organogelator with a p-type conducting polymer poly{N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-N-phenyl-N-4-vinylphenyl-[1,1-biphenyl]-4,4-diamin} has been reported by Wicklein et al. for the first time for solar cell applications.39 A bulk heterojunction solar cell with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.041% has been fabricated using this hybrid gel consisting of a donor acceptor interface capable of separating and transporting charges. From our laboratory, we have recently reported a conducting donor–acceptor hydrogel using polyaniline (PANI) as the donor and 5,5′-(1,3,5,7-tetraoxopyrrolo[3,4-f]isoindole-2,6-diyl)diisophthalic acid (P) as the acceptor as well as the gelator.45,46P intimately mixes with PANI in the gel state making PANI very well dispersed in the hydrogel matrix. A dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) has been fabricated using the hydrogel yielding a PCE of 0.1%.45
In the quest of improving the PCE in the present work, we have synthesized a trihybrid conducting hydrogel consisting of P, graphene oxide (GO) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) (Scheme 1). GO is an acceptor47 and both P and GO can, therefore, simultaneously play the role of a joint acceptor while PEDOT:PSS functions as the donor in the trihybrid gels. By varying the concentration of the donor PEDOT:PSS in the trihybrid gel, the PCE can be improved and we have successfully fabricated DSSCs showing a maximum PCE of 4.5%. A comparison from the additivity of the PCEs of binary systems indicates that the trihybrid network has an additional contribution to the PCE. It is interesting to note that it has the highest PCE value for using a hybrid gel matrix as a substitute of the active component TiO2 in DSSCs. GO remains dispersed in the P gel and helps in improving the mechanical properties of the gels. From the electrical characterization of the samples in the gel and xerogel phases it is observed that the gels and xerogels exhibit different electronic properties. The hybrid gels show a very high rectification ratio of 61, which may find application as a soft rectifier, however, the xerogels do not exhibit any rectification property. Impedance spectroscopy is used to understand this different behaviour and it is also used to understand the photoconduction process in DSSCs. Thus a magnificent improvement (45 times) in the PCE is achieved in the supramolecular gel of P by elegantly incorporating GO as a co-acceptor and changing the donor conducting polymer from PANI to PEDOT:PSS.
2. Experimental section
Materials
Graphite, benzene-1,2,4,5-tetracarboxylic dianhydrate, 5-aminoisophthalic acid, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and sodium bicarbonate were purchased from Aldrich Chemical. Co., USA and were used as received.

Synthesis
5,5′-(1,3,5,7-Tetraoxopyrrolo[3,4-f]isoindole-2,6-diyl)diisophthalic acid (P) was synthesised using a previously reported method.45 Graphene oxide (GO) was prepared according to Hummer's method by oxidizing graphene powder with a KMnO4/NaNO3 mixture in concentrated H2SO4.48
Preparation of P, GP and GPPS gels
5 mg of P, 3.75 mg of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and 1 ml of water were added into a glass tube making the final gelator (P) concentration of 0.5% (w/v). The mixture was sealed and sonicated to get a homogeneous solution and heated to 80 °C. A few drops of 1 (N) HCl were added to the hot solution to make the pH neutral (tested by pH paper) followed by cooling to room temperature (30 °C) yielding the P gel. To produce the P–GO (GP) hybrid gel the same procedure was extended by dissolving 5 mg P in 1 ml of the above NaHCO3 solution where 5 mg GO was added and the mixture was sonicated for an hour followed by heating to 80 °C. Formation of a black colored solution of the GP hybrid was observed and a few drops of 1 (N) HCl were added to the hybrid solution to make the pH neutral. Cooling the solution to room temperature (30 °C) yielded a black coloured GP gel. To make the trihybrid gel containing PEDOT:PSS; P (5 mg), GO (5 mg) and NaHCO3 (3.75 mg) were dissolved in a required quantity of water by mild heating. To this solution 0.80, 1.1 and 1.4 ml of the PEDOT:PSS (1.3%, w/v) solution were added to make the total volume of 2 ml and sonicated for one hour followed by heating at 80 °C. A few drops of 1 (N) HCL were added and afterwards cooled to room temperature, yielding deep blue gels. The gels were named as GPPS1, GPPS2 and GPPS3 according to the volumes 0.80, 1.1 and 1.4 ml of the PEDOT:PSS solution added, respectively. The compositions of the hybrid gels are presented in Table 1.

Microscopy
The morphologies of the gels were studied by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Small portions of the gels were placed on a glass coverslip and were dried in air at room temperature for a week and finally in a vacuum for two days. SEM images of the gels were observed through a FESEM instrument (JEOL, JSM 6700F) operating at 5 kV after platinum coating. Using the same procedure diluted gels were drop-cast onto a carbon coated copper grid (300 mesh) and the samples were dried in open air at 30 °C. The thickness of the active layer is determined from cross-sectional SEM microscopy.
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
A differential scanning calorimeter (Perkin-Elmer, Diamond DSC) was used for measuring the gel melting temperature. The instrument was calibrated with indium before each set of experiments. The gel samples were taken in a large-volume capsule (LVC) fitted with O-rings and were equilibrated at 10 °C for 10 min. They were then heated to 80 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere and the melting point was determined from the peak position of the endotherm.
Spectroscopy
The UV-vis spectra of the gels were recorded with a Hewlett-Packard UV-vis spectrophotometer (model 8453) in a cuvette of 0.1 cm path length. The FTIR spectra of the xerogels were recorded using KBr pellets in a Perkin-Elmer FTIR instrument (FT-IR-8400S). Also the Raman spectra of the xerogel samples were recorded from 1000 to 2000 cm−1 using 514 nm laser sources in a micro-Raman spectrometer (Agitron).
Diffraction study
Wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) experiments on all the xerogel samples were carried out in a Bruker AXS diffractometer (model D8 Advance) using a Lynx Eye detector. The instrument was operated at 40 kV voltage and 40 mA current. The xerogels were scanned in the range of 2θ = 5–50° at a scan rate of 0.3 s per step with a step width of 0.02.
Rheology
To understand the mechanical properties of the P, GP and GPPS gels, the rheological experiments were performed with an advanced rheometer (AR 2000, TA Instruments, New Castle, DE) using cone–plate geometry on a Peltier plate. The plate used has a diameter of 40 mm and a cone angle of 4° with a gap of 121 μm.
Conductivity
The dc-conductivity of the xerogels was measured by a two-probe method at 25 °C using sandwiched xerogels between two fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting strips of 1 mm width placed perpendicularly. The area of the samples was 0.01 cm2, and the thickness of the samples was measured using slide callipers. The conductivity of the xerogels was measured by using an electrometer (Keithley, model 617) at 25 °C using the equation: (1)where ‘R’ is the resistance, ‘a’ is the area of the sample and ‘d’ is the thickness of the xerogels. The I–V characteristic curves of the gels and xerogels were recorded at 25 °C by scanning from (i) 0 to +5 V and then (ii) +5 to −5 V followed by (iii) a reverse scan from −5 to 0 V. Also the I–V characteristic curves measured under the illumination of light intensity (100 mW cm−2) were obtained separately.
Dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) construction
A small portion of the gel samples was deposited on the FTO and completely dried in air to obtain a thin film. All the GPPS gels are sensitized by dipping into a 0.5 mM ethanolic solution of the N719 dye (a ruthenium complex dye) for around 12 h. The N719 dye became adsorbed in the xerogel matrix as the porous structure of the xerogels helps in easy diffusion of the dye molecules. It was then dried in air and the iodide-triiodide-based electrolyte solution, with 0.5 M KI and 0.05 M I2 in γ-butyrolactone, were added dropwise on the active electrode area. The average active electrode area was around 0.65 cm2. A graphite-coated FTO glass plate (2 × 2 cm2) was used as the counter electrode. Two electrodes were separated by a 60 μm parafilm and were sandwiched together with clips. A small space of bare FTO glass was uncovered for a wire connection on the anode. The solar cell construction was accomplished by placing the GPPS face of the FTO substrate on top of the counter electrode in a face-to-face fashion. The current between two electrodes was measured using a Keithley source meter (model 2401). The cell currents were measured by illumination with white light from a 150 W xenon lamp source (Newport Corp., Springfield, OH; model 67005). The illumination was 100 mW cm−2 for all the acquired data. We have made five devices and the best result is presented here. The reproducibility of the PCE values of the devices is within 5%. The controlled experiments of measuring PCE for (i) PEDOT:PSS and GO and (ii) PEDOT:PSS and P are made in a similar fashion as described above.
For the determination of dye adsorption in the GPPS DSSC the cell without the dye was dipped into a 0.5 mM ethanolic solution of the N719 dye for 12 h. After adsorption of the dye the residual concentration of the dye was measured with a UV-visible spectrophotometer using a calibration plot (Fig. S1†) taking the absorbance at the 530 nm wavelength and hence the net dye adsorbed on the GPPS surface is calculated to be 5.6 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for the GPPS3 sample.
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) as a function of wavelength was measured with a Newport 66902150 Watt Xe-lamp in combination with an Oriel Cornerstone 130 monochromator and a Keithley 236 source measure unit controlled by Visual Basic software.
Impedance spectroscopy
Electrochemical impedance spectra of all the gels and xerogels were measured using a Solartron SI 1260 impedance analyzer (Solarton, London, U.K.) at 25 °C over the frequency range from 1 Hz to 32 MHz with an ac perturbation of 100 mV at the 0 V dc level. In the Nyquist plot, the imaginary part of impedance (Z′′) was plotted on the +Y axis, and the real part of impedance (Z′) was plotted on the X axis, representing a typical Cole–Cole plot in the complex impedance plane. The resistance and capacitance of the systems were computed using the Z-view software of the instrument.
3. Results and discussion
Morphology and structure
In Fig. 1 FESEM images of P, GP and GPPS1 gels are presented and it is evident that the P gel has a good fibrillar network morphology which is retained in the GP gel. Here the fibrils assemble on the crumpled GO sheet, indicating the presence of noncovalent interactions between the outer surfaces of P fibrils and GO nanosheets. In Fig. 1c the FESEM micrograph of the trihybrid gel (GPPS1) is shown indicating that the fibrillar network morphology of GP gels is retained and in the interior of the network apart from the GO sheets some small spheroidal particles are observed. An enlarged image of the system (Fig. 1d) also indicates the presence of the spheroids, suggesting that only a part of PEDOT:PSS is used to produce the trihybrid gel.49 The selective energy-dispersive spectrum (EDS) (Fig. S2†) of the spheroidal spots shows a sulphur content of 7.15% and at the outside the sulphur amount is 0.47%. For the GPSS1 xerogel the added amount of sulphur from PEDOT:PSS is calculated to be 10% (w/w). So the above EDS results signify that a portion of PEDOT:PSS co-assembles with the P fibre and the rest of it produces the spheroidal structure where also some fibres pass over it. However, it is difficult to comment on the fraction of PEDOT:PSS used to produce the co-assembly with the GP system and similar results were also reported earlier for a polycarbonate nanocomposite containing PEDOT:PSS and MWCNTs.49 In Fig. 2a the TEM image of the GP gel is presented and it supports very well the homogeneous dispersion of the P fibres on the GO surface. The TEM image of the GPPS1 gel is shown in Fig. 2b which clearly indicates the sheathing of P fibres on the GO surface. Also the black spots inside the fibrillar network indicate the PEDOT:PSS spheres produced from the unused part after making the trihybrid gel.

To understand the thermal stability of the gels, the DSC thermograms of all gels are presented in Fig. 3. There is an interesting change in melting points; P, GP, GPPS1, GPPS2 and GPPS3 gels exhibit gel melting temperatures of 60, 69, 63, 62, and, 58 °C, respectively. In the GP gel the GO sheets act as a thermal barrier to the heat flow so it requires a higher temperature to disrupt the physical junctions of the gel. As PEDOT:PSS is added to the system it enters the GO gallery, making it a less effective thermal barrier, thus reducing the gel melting temperature.

To understand the nature of interactions present in the hybrid gels the FTIR spectra of P powder, P gel, GP gel and GPPS gels are presented in Fig. 4. The stretching frequency of the carboxylic hydroxyl groups of P appears at 3450 cm−1 and it shifts to 3437 cm−1 in the xerogel of P, indicating the presence of the intermolecular H-bonding interaction in the gel state. In GO there are –COOH, –OH, and epoxy groups characterized by the vibration peaks at 3411, 1723, 1383 (–OH deformation), 1229 (–OH stretching) and 1051 cm−1, respectively.50 In the GP gel the –OH stretching frequency of carboxylic acid has shifted from 3437 cm−1 to 3430 cm−1 and it may be attributed to the overlapping of the vibrational peaks of –OH and carboxylic –OH groups of GO with that of the carboxylic acid group of P and also due to the H-bonding interaction between the components. In the GPPS1 hybrid gel there is a shift of the benzenoid ring vibration from 1620 cm−1 in GO to 1632 and 1633 cm−1 in GPPS1 and GPPS3 samples and the intensity of this vibration peak also gets reduced significantly, suggesting the presence of π–π stacking interactions.51 It is also important to note that the intensity of the epoxy and hydroxyl groups of the GP gel becomes gradually reduced with the addition of PEDOT:PSS and it may be attributed to the reduction of GO during the GPPS gel formation from GP gels. A significant amount of reduction occurs in the GPPS3 gel as no characteristic peaks of epoxy and hydroxyl groups are observed.
 Fig. 4  FTIR spectra of P powder, GO and P, GP, GPPS1, GPPS3 xerogels. 
To understand the reduced state of GO in the hybrid gels the Raman spectra of the gels are recorded and are presented in Fig. 5. GO exhibits two peaks at 1360 and 1591 cm−1 corresponding to the disorder-induced phonon mode (D band) of sp3 carbons and Raman-allowed phonon mode (G band) of sp2 carbons, respectively.52 In the GP gels shifts of these peaks are observed and it may be attributed to the presence of π–π interactions. In the Raman spectra of PEDOT:PSS, a peak characterizing the skeleton vibration of the polymer is present and in the GPPS gel that skeleton vibration peak shifts to a lower frequency along with the shifts of the D and G band indicating the presence of π–π interactions between the components in the trihybrid gels. It is also important to note that the ratio of the intensities of the D and G bands (ID/IG) of GO (0.94) gradually increases to 0.98 and finally to 1.11 for the GP and GPPS3 xerogels, respectively. The increase of the ID/IG ratio of the GP xerogel may be attributed to the noncovalent interaction between GO and P causing an increase of the sp3 domain due to the formation of a truncated GO structure, thus increasing the ID/IG ratio from 0.94 to 0.98.52 But in the case of the GPPS3 trihybrid gel the increase of the ID/IG ratio is significantly large (1.11) which may be attributed to the reduction of GO during the trihybrid gel formation and this reduction causes an increase of the defect structure due to the formation of a large number of small graphitic domains in the reduced GO causing an increase of the ID/IG ratio.53 The effect of the noncovalent interaction of PEDOT:PSS with GO is also an additional cause as it may also develop a truncated GO structure. It is to be mentioned here that the FTIR spectra (Fig. 4) have also indicated a significant reduction of GO in GPPS hybrid gels supporting our explanation of the increase of the ID/IG ratio in GPPS hybrid gels. The shift of the Raman peak of PEDOT:PSS at 1444 cm−1 to 1436 cm−1 may also suggest its oxidation from benzenoid to a higher conducting quinonoid structure.49 In the GPPS gels as GO gets partially reduced, one component must be oxidised and hence the oxidation of PEDOT:PSS at least to some extent is inevitable.
 Fig. 5  Raman spectra of GO, PEDOT:PSS, and GP, GPPS3 xerogels. 
In order to get a deeper insight into the self-assembly process we have recorded UV-vis spectra of the P–Na salt solution (Fig. S3a†) that exhibits two peaks at 312 and 324 nm which may be attributed to the π–π* transition and π–π* transition coupled with the n–π* transition, respectively.45 The addition of a dilute acidic aqueous solution to the P–Na salt yields a P assembly which exhibits a hump at 289 nm and a broad peak around 318 nm. The 21 nm blue shift of the π–π* transition peak in the assembled state of P signifies π-stacking interactions producing the P assembly. In the inset of Fig. S3b† GO exhibits a peak at 240 nm (inset) ascribed to the π–π* transitions. In the GP gel the peak gets blue-shifted to 222 nm. The 18 nm blue shift of the π–π* transition peak of GO is the result of the π-stacking interaction between GO and P in the GP gel. PEDOT:PSS shows an absorption peak at 224 nm due to π–π* transitions. In the GPPS1 gel the nature of the peak is similar to that of the PEDOT:PSS peak with a small blue-shift to 222 nm and it may also be attributed to the π–π interactions of PEDOT:PSS with the GP system. Thus the absorption spectral results support the π-stacking that is also claimed from the Raman spectra indicating the presence of π–π interactions in the hybrid gels.
The structures of the gels are further investigated from WAXS patterns (Fig. 6) and it is apparent from the figure that GO has a peak at 2θ = 10.9° (d-spacing = 8.1 Å) which corresponds to the interlayer spacing between the GO sheets. In the GP gel this peak shifts to a lower angle (2θ = 10.1°) corresponding to a d-spacing of 8.8 Å. This increase of the d-spacing of the GP gel indicates that the gelator P enters the interlayer of GO sheets causing expansion of the interlayer gallery. It is also noticed that there is a peak at 2θ = 24.8° (d = 3.6 Å) which corresponds to the π–π stacking distance of the GP system. In the GPPS1 and GPPS3 gel the interlayer distance of GO sheets gradually increases from 8.8 Å in GP to 9.1 and 9.5 Å, respectively. This increase of the interlayer distance indicates the entry of PEDOT:PSS chains in the interlayer of GO sheets. From this result we may suggest that both P and PEDOT:PSS can enter the interstacking distance of GO probably due to the π–π interaction in the GPPS systems. So from the above analysis of morphology and structural results it may be surmised that GO sheets in the trihybrid gels are in the swollen state where apart from the solvent (water) molecules both the gelator P and the PEDOT:PSS chain enter the interlayer of GO sheets. The gelator fibres mix well with these swollen GO sheets and also with the polymer PEDOT:PSS (Scheme 2).

Mechanical properties
In Fig. 7a the variations of storage (G′) and loss (G′′) moduli with angular frequency are presented and it is evident that both the G′ and G′′ are almost invariant for all the systems in a long frequency range. Furthermore, in every system G′ > G′′ confirms the gel behaviour of the system. A comparison of G′ values at a particular frequency for P, GP, and GPPS3 gels indicates that the GP gel has the highest value (Table 2) and it exhibits a 4460% increase compared to that of the P gel. This large increase of G′ is due to the reinforcing action of GO nanosheets which facilitate the storage of energy due to their large surface area and aspect ratio.51,54

The G′′ value also exhibits a similar increase (3854%) to that of the P gel and it may be attributed to the same reason as for G′. It is noteworthy that after the inclusion of PEDOT:PSS in the GP gel both the G′ and G′′ increase compared to those of P but the increase (1352%) is much lower than that in the GP gel. Probably the PEDOT:PSS chains enter the GO gallery causing more swelling thus increasing the effective thickness of GO sheets hence decreasing the aspect ratio. Also the transfer of energy through the interface between GO and P fibres may be hampered for lowering of the interfacial interaction with the P gel fibers due to blocking by the PEDOT:PSS chains. These are the two possible reasons operating in the GPPS gels for decreasing the moduli values compared to those of the GP gel. The elasticity of the gels is measured from the G′ and G′′ data (Table 2) and it also indicates a maximum increase in the GP gel and the reason is the same as described above. We have also measured the stiffness (G′/G′′) of the gels and the values are 6.9, 8.1 and 6.0 for P, GP and GPPS3 gels. These results indicate that the G′ and G′′ values are enhanced almost to the same degree indicating the same reason for the increase of both G′ and G′′ in the hybrid gels.
In the stress sweep experiment (Fig. 7b) all the gels can withstand lower stresses but, as expected, they break at higher oscillatory stresses. The stress at break varies for P, GP and GPPS3 gels and it is highest for the GP gel (Table 2) with an increase of 1482% from that of the P gel. This result indicates that the GO sheets enhance the stability of the P gel but on the introduction of PEDOT:PSS the stability against the applied stress is much lower suggesting a lower degree of supramolecular interactions in the trihybrid gel. In the creep recovery experiment (Fig. 8) for an applied stress of 0.5 Pa there is a jump in the strain value and then a slow increase of strain occurs with time due to the viscoelastic nature of all the samples. After release of the stress all the gels exhibit an instant sharp strain recovery followed by a gradual strain recovery with time. The strain recovery after the release of stress at time t2 (300 s) is 36, 30 and 65% for P (Fig. 8a), GP (Fig. 8b) and GPPS3 (Fig. 8c) gels for a duration of 600 s. These strain recovery data may be explained by the stiffness values of the gels, e.g. in the GP gel stiffness is found to be highest and hence it exhibits the lowest strain recovery and the GPPS3 has the lowest stiffness showing the highest strain recovery in the creep recovery experiment.

Electronic and optoelectronic properties of the gels

dc-conductivity. 
The dc conductivities of the hybrid xerogels are presented in Table 3 and it is apparent that the P gel shows a conductivity of 2.34 × 10−7 s cm−1. This conductivity may arise from the π stacked electrons present in the gel fibre. On addition of GO to the P gel the dc-conductivity has increased by one order of magnitude and it may be attributed to the GO sheets which are in contact with the P fibres of the gel. The π clouds of GO sheets being in contact with the P fibres facilitate the mobility of the charge carriers passing through the fibres of the P gel due to the increased conjugation of the system as a whole. Now with the addition of PEDOT:PSS to the GP gel the conductivity has increased by three–four orders of magnitude depending on the concentration of PEDOT:PSS. The probable reason is that the PEDOT:PSS chains contribute to the additional conductivity via adsorption on the P fibers. The conjugated PEDOT:PSS chains along with the conjugated reduced graphene oxide (rGO)sheets, produced during the trihybrid gel formation, increase the mobility of charge carriers further. In addition, during the reduction of GO to rGO, PEDOT:PSS itself becomes oxidised to a higher conducting quinonoid structure contributing to higher conductivity.49

Current–voltage (I–V) properties. 
The I–V properties of the hybrid gels (Fig. 9a, b and S4†) exhibit an interesting behaviour. All the gels exhibit semiconducting behaviour with rectification properties. However, the degree of rectification (i.e. rectification ratio) varies with the composition of the hybrid gels. In the GP gel the rectification ratio is 6.3, but on gradual addition of PEDOT:PSS the rectification ratio gradually increases e.g. 49, 53, 61 for GPPS1, GPPS2 and GPPS3, respectively. The rectification properties usually arise from the p–n junction formation. P is a well-known acceptor,46 thus in the GP gel P acts as an n-type semiconductor and GO behaves as a p-type semiconductor due to their relative electron accepting properties. The intimate co-existence of P fibres with the GO sheets causes the formation of a large number of p–n junctions yielding rectification properties. On addition of the PEDOT:PSS and increasing its concentration the rectification ratio increases significantly. This is because the PEDOT:PSS is a very good donor and hence it would act as a p-type semiconductor and under these circumstances GO also acts as an acceptor, and hence it would act as an n-type semiconductor.47 Thus both the P and GO would together act as a joint acceptor with PEDOT:PSS as the donor, forming a very large number of p–n junctions probably with a lower diffusion length. This causes formation of effective p–n junctions with a large number density, thus increasing the rectification ratio significantly. It is important to note that in contrast to the gel state, in the xerogel state no such rectification property is observed (Fig. 9c, d and S4†), introducing the role of solvent (water) molecules in the effective p–n junction formation. It might be possible that in the gel state a good dispersion of PEDOT:PSS and GO exists in closer contact to the P fibres facilitating the p–n junction formation. But in the xerogel state the conducting polymer PEDOT:PSS and GO may become somewhat segregated causing difficulty in the effective p–n junction formation required for rectification. Also the presence of polar water molecules in the gel state helps the diffusion of charge carriers (electrons and holes) at the interface of the p–n junction which is not possible in the xerogel state.19

Optoelectronic properties. 

Fig. 10a, b and S5† exhibit the change of I–V curves of the hybrid xerogels in the presence of light compared to that in the absence of it. In the hybrid xerogel systems there is an increase of current at the same applied voltage for irradiation with a constant light intensity (100 mW cm−2). The semiconducting behaviour is retained in all the hybrid xerogels but the current is higher than that under dark conditions at each applied voltage. In Table 4 a quantitative presentation of the amount of current at 5 V under dark conditions and the percent increase of the current on illumination are presented for all the hybrid gels. It is apparent from the table that the magnitude of the current increase in the GP gel is lowest but the percent increase on illumination is very high. A probable reason may be the photo-excitons generated here do not decay but flow through the GO sheets producing a higher yield of photocurrent. In the GPPS gels both the dark current and the percent increase of photocurrent gradually increase with the increase of PEDOT:PSS concentration as with the increase of PEDOT:PSS a larger number of photo-excitons are produced contributing to the higher increment rate. However, compared to GP the lower increment of photocurrent in GPPS samples might be attributed to a higher rate of decay of photoexcitons in the trihybrid gels.

The increase of photocurrent compared to that of dark current under illumination is very interesting and it would be of great interest to fabricate solar cells and measure their efficiency. In a forward step we have measured the on–off current cycles to understand the reversibility of the process by exposing the hybrid xerogels to the light of 100 mW cm−2 intensity and the on–off cycles are presented in Fig. 10 and S5.† It is apparent from the figures that the reversibility of GPPS gels is better than that of the GP gel and it gradually increases with the increase of PEDOT:PSS concentration. There are a number of reports where GO becomes reduced in the presence of light55 and it is probable that the gradual formation of rGO reduces the number of photoelectrons, produced from the oxygenated groups, thereby reducing the photocurrent in the consecutive cycles. But in the GPPS systems PEDOT:PSS chains act as the source of photoelectrons and the GO and P act as a joint acceptor. On gradual irradiation of light more rGO is produced and as rGO is a better acceptor than GO, an increase of photocurrent, though small, is observed in the on–off cycle. These important optoelectronic properties therefore promote us to fabricate dye-sensitized solar cells from the GPPS trihybrid gels.

Dye-sensitized solar cells
We have fabricated dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) using GPPS hybrid hydrogels with an FTO/GPPS-gel/graphite device using the ruthenium N719 dye. The UV-vis spectra of the dry N719 dye, GPPS3 xerogel, and GPPS3 device are presented in Fig. 11. It is evident from Fig. 11 that the N719 dye exhibits two characteristic peaks at 385 and 536 nm, corresponding to metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transitions and the 385 nm peak contains some characteristics of the π–π* (ligand centred) transition.56 In this range GPPS3 does not exhibit any characteristic absorbance peak. So in the solid state there is a red shift of the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) peak of the dye from 385 to 395 nm and the lower energy band also shifts from 536 to 539 nm. These results indicate the presence of π–π interactions between the dye and the GPPS3 xerogel in the DSSC.
 Fig. 11  UV-vis spectra of the dry N719 dye, GPPS3 xerogel, and GPPS3 device after dye absorption. 
The device has been illuminated with a light of intensity 100 mW cm−2 and the cell current is measured using an electrometer. The current density is plotted against the cell voltage (Fig. 12) for all the hybrid gel samples. The short circuit current (JSC) is found to be highest for the GPPS3 hybrid gel, (Table 5) and it may be attributed to the highest amount of PEDOT:PSS present in the hybrid gel. The JSC increases gradually with the increase of the PEDOT:PSS concentration and it may be attributed to the increased mobility of charge carriers through the increased conducting paths. But the open circuit voltage (VOC) remains the same for all the GPPS samples. The VOC in DSSCs is a measure of the difference between the quasi-Fermi level on the electrode and the redox potential of the electrolyte and it depends on the nature of the semiconducting material indicating that the band gap of the trihybrid gel systems does not change with the concentration of PEDOT:PSS, particularly for the concentration range studied here. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) indicates that GPPS3 exhibits the highest PCE of 4.46%. This is really an interesting result amongst the gel samples where in the literature the highest PCE is reported to be 0.1%.45 Thus using the trihybrid GPPS hydrogels as an active material we have been able to fabricate DSSCs without using TiO2 with a moderate PCE value. The dark current of GPPS3 is also presented in Fig. 12 for comparison indicating the dark current is negligible compared to the photocurrent. Fig. 13 presents the IPCE curve of DSSCs of GPPS3 showing an absorption in the range of 360–700 nm. It exhibits a moderate IPCE of ∼57% at the absorption peak of 560 nm.

 Fig. 13  IPCE spectra of the DSSCs based on GPPS3. 
In order to understand the effect of the co-assembled gel structure on the PCE of the system we have made controlled experiments under similar conditions. The DSSC of PEDOT:PSS and GO (GPEDOT) shows a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.25% and the cell made of P and PEDOT:PSS xerogel yields a PCE value of 0.27% (Fig. S6, Table-S1†). If we take the additive contribution of PCE of both the acceptors then the PCE of the trihybrid system should be 3.52% so in the trihybrid gel (GPPS3) the PCE is higher by ∼1.0%, indicating the influence of the co-assembled gel structure on the PCE value.
The mechanism of photoconduction is presented in (Scheme 3) taking the LUMO energy levels of PEDOT:PSS (−2.4 eV),57 GO (−3.5 eV)58 and P (−4.25 eV).59 The N-719 dye absorbs light and electrons of the dye are promoted to their excited state. The excited electrons then enter the LUMO of PEDOT:PSS and pass through the LUMO (conduction band) of the GO and then enter the LUMO of P leading to their flow in the external circuit. The intimate mixing of the components (P, GO and PEDOT:PSS) assists the entire process of charge flow.

Impedance spectra
AC-impedance spectroscopy is an important non-destructive technique for characterization of conducting materials and in order to understand the electronic and optoelectronic properties more meticulously, analysis of the impedance spectra of gels and xerogels is made. The Nyquist plots, comprising the imaginary part vs. real part of impedance (Z) of the hybrid xerogels, are presented in Fig. 14a and in each case semicircular curves are obtained. A comparison of the Cole–Cole plots of GPPS xerogels indicates a decrease of the radius of semicircles with increasing PEDOT:PSS concentration in the hybrid xerogels. Of course, it is necessary to mention here that in the Nyquist plot the GP xerogel does not fit well in the scale of the figure and hence it is separately shown in the inset of Fig. 14a. In order to interpret the Cole–Cole plots equivalent R–C circuits are drawn by fitting the impedance data in the Z-view program (Solatron). The equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 14c and the respective resistance (R) and constant phase element (CPE) data are presented in Table 6. From the CPE data the capacitance (C) values are calculated using the equation:60 (2)where R is the parallel resistance, Q is the pre-factor of the CPE, and n is its exponent where CPE is related through the equation CPE−1 = Q(iω)n; i being an imaginary factor, and ω is the frequency.

It is apparent from the table that the resistance for both the ionic and the bulk (electronic) conductivity is lowest in the case of the GPPS3 gel. This is due to the highest concentration of PEDOT:PSS in this hybrid gel. It is also noteworthy that the electronic resistance (R2) of the GP gel is much larger than those of GPPS gels, indicating that the PEDOT:PSS facilities electronic conduction through its long conjugated chain. However, the GP and GPPS gels do not exhibit any definite trend of ionic resistance R1 with increasing PEDOT:PSS concentration suggesting ionic conductivity in all the systems, though present, is of negligible magnitude. It is very important to note that the C value sharply increases with the increase of PEDOT:PSS concentration and GPPS3 exhibits the highest value of 3.4 mF. This sharp increase of capacitance with PEDOT:PSS concentration might be related to the easier storage of charges along with the conjugated polymer chain in addition to the π-stacked structure between GO and the gelator P extending it to behave as a good capacitor.
The Debye plots of imaginary impedance with frequency of the hybrid xerogels (Fig. 15a) inform us about the bulk relaxation dynamics of the systems. In every system a single Debye peak is noticed suggesting a singular bulk relaxation time associated with the charge hopping process. It is interesting to note that the peak position of the Debye plots shifts gradually to a higher frequency with increasing PEDOT:PSS concentration suggesting faster relaxation dynamics due to the presence of more labile charge carriers in the conjugated paths of the conducting polymer.

(b) Plot of the imaginary part of impedance with logf of the GPPS1, GPPS2 and GPPS3 gels (inset: plot of the imaginary part of impedance with logf of the GP gel). 
In Fig. S7† the variation of dielectric constant (ε′) as a function of frequency for all the hybrid xerogels is presented and it progressively decreases with decrease in the PEDOT:PSS concentration limiting to a very small value (317) for the GP gels. The variation of ε′ with frequency is very sharp for the GPPS3 sample, it decreases from 76373 to 2014 with the increase of frequency. A possible reason is that the alignment of permanent and induced dipoles is not as fast as that in the change of direction of the field (e.g. frequency). This causes a decrease of polarization and reaches a constant minimum value at higher frequency.
Impedance spectra at the gel state
In Fig. 14b the Nyquist plots of GP and GPPS hybrid gels at their gel states are presented and it is evident from the figure that the nature of the Nyquist plots of the gels is different from that of the xerogels (cf.Fig. 14a). In addition to the semicircles observed in the xerogel state in each case a sloping line at lower frequencies are observed. The sloping line (spike) may be ascribed to occur from the Warburg impedance arising from the semi-infinite diffusion of the ions at the electrode.19 An analysis of the impedance data in an equivalent R–C circuit (Fig. 14c) suggests the presence of a complex circuit containing two resistances (R1, R2) one Warburg impedance (W) and a capacitance (C) parallel to R2 and W. The values of all the resistances, Warburg impedance and capacitance data (Table 7) indicate that with the increase of PEDOT:PSS concentration in the hybrid gel the C value increases from nano-Farad to micro-Farad suggesting that PEDOT:PSS helps to store the charges both in the gel and xerogel states. The resistance R1 however does not vary significantly but the bulk (electronic) resistance decreases with the increase of PEDOT:PSS concentration similar to that of the xerogels. The Warburg impedance however decreases with the increase of PEDOT:PSS concentration due to the same reason i.e. increasing the conducting path of charge carriers for the increase of the conjugated chain in the hybrid gel. It is interesting to note that the capacitance values of xerogels are approximately three orders of magnitude higher than that of the gels indicating that the xerogels can accumulate more charges for unit increase of voltage and it may be argued that the surface of the porous nanostructure has better capacity to store the charges. In the gel state the entrapped water molecules help the diffusion of charges causing the Warburg impedance supporting our explanation of rectification behaviour in the gel state. In the gel state a single Debye peak is also noticed for all the hybrid gels (Fig. 15b) suggesting a singular bulk relaxation time. The peaks of the Debye plots shift gradually to higher frequencies with increasing PEDOT:PSS concentration as in the xerogels. A comparison between the peak positions of the xerogel (Fig. 15a) and gel states indicates that the xerogels require an ∼3 orders of magnitude higher frequency for relaxation than in the gel state, suggesting faster relaxation dynamics in the gels than that in the xerogels. One possible reason may be the presence of solvent molecules accelerating the holes and electrons to relax easily.

Impedance spectra of the DSSCs
Impedance spectroscopy is a non-destructive technique to understand the electron transfer mechanism in DSSCs.61–63 Hence the impedance spectra of the solar cell devices fabricated from the three GPPS hybrid gels are presented in Fig. 16 and the Cole–Cole plots suggest the presence of three semicircles for each sample. The semicircle in the high frequency region (105 to 106 Hz) corresponds to the impedances (Z1) for the charge transport at the graphite counter electrode. The middle semicircle (frequency range of 102–105) is attributed to the impedance (Z2) arising at the GPPS/electrolyte interface. The semicircle in the low frequency region (1–102) may be attributed to the impedance (Z3) associated with the Nernstian diffusion of iodide ions within the electrolyte. The above Nyquist plots can be explained by a complex equivalent circuit diagram consisting of equivalent circuits of three units as presented in the inset of Fig. 16. From the semicircle Z1 the resistance (Rg) and capacitance (Cg) at the graphite/electrolyte interface, from the middle semicircle (Z2) the resistance (Rrc) and chemical capacitance (Cμ) between the GPPS samples and electrolyte and finally from the Z3 semicircle the iodine ion diffusion resistance (Rd) and its diffusion capacitance (Cd) are determined. All the above resistance and capacitance values of the DSSCs are presented in Table 8. The lifetime values (τ) of the injected photoelectrons to the active material (GPPS) may be calculated from eqn (3) and the τ values are also given in the table for comparison. τ = Rrc × Cμ(3)

Also the resistance (Rg) of the working electrode to the counter electrode occurring in the high frequency region (>106 Hz) is presented in Table 8. It is apparent from the table that in the samples there is a decreasing trend in all the resistances with the increase of PEDOT:PSS concentration from GPPS1 to GPPS3 but the respective capacitance values gradually increase. Of special interest are the Rrc and Cμ values because they are very important for governing the PCE value of the cell. The decrease of the resistance at the GPPS/electrolyte interface (Rrc) with the increase of PEDOT:PSS concentration may be attributed to the good conducting property of the PEDOT:PSS chains which may diffuse at the interface, thereby reducing the resistance. Also at the π-staked state of the PEDOT:PSS chain charges may get accumulated and its increasing concentration at the interface causes a gradual increase of Cμ. The lifetime values exhibit a gradual increase with increasing concentration and hence explains the highest PCE of 4.5% for the GPPS3 samples. However there are some systems where an increase of both Rrc and τ causes higher PCE values.61 But in this system a decrease of Rrc facilitates recombination of injected electrons with the I3− of the electrolyte which may cause a decrease in the PCE value, instead an increase of the PCE value is observed. This anomaly may be explained by the fact that though the photo-injected electrons tend to recombine with the electrolyte faster due to lower Rrc values, however, prior to it they become trapped into the thiophene rings of PEDOT:PSS due to its higher capacitance value. It results in an increase of the lifetime values of photo-injected electrons and hence causes the highest PCE. Thus we have been able to fabricate a DSSC with a conducting hybrid gel showing good power conversion efficiency without using TiO2 as an active material.
4. Conclusion
So P forms stable dihybrid and trihybrid hydrogels with GO and the GO–PEDOT:PSS mixture yielding highly improved mechanical properties. The dc conductivity of GPPS xerogels is 4–5 orders of magnitude higher than that of GP and P xerogels and the hybrid gels exhibit rectification properties, the rectification ratio increases with the increase of the PEDOT:PSS concentration with a highest value of 61 but GPPS xerogels do not exhibit any rectification property. The photo-current of GP and GPPS xerogels is higher than dark current and the on–off cycles exhibit a stable photocurrent of the latter system. DSSCs fabricated with the GPPS gels as active layers and the N719 dye exhibit an increase of power conversion efficiency (PCE) with the increase of the PEDOT:PSS concentration showing a maximum PCE of 4.5% for the GPPS3 sample. The IPCE curve of GPPS3 DSSCs shows an absorption range of 360–700 nm with the maximum absorbance of ∼57%. The Nyquist plots between the xerogels and gels exhibit a considerable difference, the latter exhibit a semicircle with an additional slopping line corresponding to the Warburg impedance. The appearance of Warburg impedance at the impedance spectra of the gel state suggests the diffusion of charge carriers through the polar water molecules in the gels, accounting for the rectification properties observed in the gel state. The Cole–Cole plot of the DSSC corresponds to a complex equivalent circuit comprising three R–C circuits explaining well the PCE values of the different GPPS gels. Thus, we have obtained a magnificent power conversion efficiency (4.5%) in the P gel by elegantly incorporating GO as a co-acceptor and a donor conducting polymer PEDOT:PSS. The DSSC of PEDOT:PSS and GO shows a PCE of 3.25% and that of P and PEDOT:PSS is 0.27%. Taking the additive contribution of PCE for both the acceptors the PCE of the trihybrid system should be 3.52%, but a higher PCE of ∼1.0% in the GPPS3 gel is observed. It may be attributed to the co-assembled fibrillar network structure of the three components. This is the first time that such a high PCE value using a supramolecular gel as an active material instead of TiO2 in DSSCs is reported.
