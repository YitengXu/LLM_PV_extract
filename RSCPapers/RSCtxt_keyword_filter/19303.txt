    , Accepted 20th August 2014First published on 20th August 2014AbstractThree dimensional cauliflower-fungus-like graphene (3D CFG), which possesses high conductivity and excellent catalytic activity, was directly synthesized from CO2. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) with 3D CFG as a counter electrode exhibited a high energy conversion efficiency of 8.1%, which is 10 times higher than that (0.7%) of a DSSC with a counter electrode based on the regular graphene synthesized via chemical exfoliation of graphite. The efficiency is even better than that (7.5%) of the DSSCs with an expensive Pt counter electrode. This would provide a novel approach not only to synthesize free-standing 3D graphene for solar cells, but also to control CO2 emission.
Carbon dioxide is a critical greenhouse gas responsible for global warming.1–3 While technology to capture CO2 is commercially available for large CO2 emitters such as power plants, CO2 storage is challenging due to issues such as leakage of CO2 from storage media and high sequestration costs.4–8 The conversion of CO2 into useful materials, which is very difficult due to its high stability and low reactivity, is being considered as a promising solution to solve CO2 issues, including synthesis of energy-rich C1 compounds,9–11 carboxylation and carbonation of organic substrates,12–14 electrochemical reduction,15,16 combustion reduction to carbon nanomaterials,17 and photochemical conversion.18–20 Furthermore, our previous work showed that CO2 can be converted into two useful solid materials, carbon nitride and lithium cyanamide, via an exothermic reaction between Li3N and CO2.21
Graphene has emerged as a material with unique properties, which are promising for its potential applications in electronic devices, sensors, composites, and energy storage devices.22–31 Numerous approaches, such as mechanical cleavage,22 chemical vapor deposition,32 and epitaxial growth,33 have been developed to synthesize the first generation graphene (namely, the supported flat graphene sheet) for fundamental research. However, for their practical applications, synthesis of free-standing graphene sheets (without substrate) with controllable shape as a three dimensional structure is necessary. Ruoff et al. pioneered the synthesis of a porous graphene paper by exfoliating graphene oxide for high-energy-density supercapacitors.34 Cheng and his co-workers made a breakthrough with the preparation of graphene foam.35 The interconnected network in the 3D graphene foam constitutes the fast transport channel of the charge carrier for high electrical conductivity. Several groups synthesized novel macro- and mesoporous graphene frameworks (GFs)36–38 and graphene tubes.39,40 Recently, we developed 3D honeycomb-like graphene sheets by performing the reaction between Li2O and CO and explored their applications for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).41 Actually, increasing effort on the exploration of 3D graphene is the indication that research on graphene is moving into its second generation.
Solar cells provide an efficient method to convert solar energy into electrical energy. However, the high cost of electricity produced from commercial silicon has motivated the exploration of new types of solar cells. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted much attention because of their easy fabrication and low cost.42,43 A typical DSSC consists of dye-sensitized titania as a photoanode, iodide/triiodide as a redox shuttle, and platinum as a counter electrode. The counter electrode (CE) is an essential component, which catalyzes the reduction of I3− to I− for iodine-based electrolytes. An ideal CE material must possess high catalytic activity, high conductivity, and low cost. Although platinum is a standard CE for DSSCs, its high cost would limit its applications. This has motivated the exploration of inexpensive carbon-based counter electrodes for DSSCs.44
In this communication, we report a unique type of 3D graphene sheet—cauliflower-fungus-like graphene (CFG) directly from CO2via a simple reaction between Li liquid and CO2 gas. This would constitute a novel approach not only to synthesize 3D graphene, but also to control CO2 emissions. Furthermore, these 3D graphene sheets exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performance as a counter electrode for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with an energy conversion efficiency as high as 8.1%, which is even better than that (7.5%) of a DSSC with an expensive platinum counter electrode.
Our approach is based on the reaction of the Li liquid with CO2 gas to form graphene-structured carbon and Li2CO3 as follows: 4Li(l) + 3CO2(g) = C(graphene)(s) + 2Li2CO3(s)(1)
The negative values of the reaction Gibbs free energy and enthalpy, which were obtained in our thermodynamic calculation (Fig. S1 in the ESI†), demonstrate its thermodynamic feasibility and exothermic features, respectively. Furthermore, graphite formation can be prevented by simultaneous generation of Li2CO3 with graphene via isolating the graphene sheets from each other during the synthesis. To prove the feasibility of this approach experimentally, 100 mg of lithium particles (from Aldrich) was loaded in a batch ceramic-tube reactor and then CO2 was introduced into the reactor (with an initial pressure of 50 psi), followed by heating to a selected temperature of 500 to 650 °C, leading to the reaction between the Li liquid and CO2 gas (for 48 hours, unless mentioned otherwise). The reaction was further confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of the products, in which the diffraction peaks of Li2CO3 with a small amount of Li2O were observed (Fig. 1A). After Li2O and Li2CO3 were removed from the products with hydrochloric acid (followed by H2O-washing and then drying at 80 °C), the carbon powder (identified by elemental analysis) was obtained (Table 1). Furthermore, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) observations with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) revealed that the produced carbon is three dimensional cauliflower-fungus-like graphene (CFG) with a sheet thickness of about 2 nm (Fig. 2A). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to evaluate their micro-structures. As shown in Fig. 2B, one can see the wrinkled and folded morphology of the graphene sheets. Furthermore, the local structure of cauliflower-fungus-like sheets was examined by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). For all three selected locations (Fig. 2C and D), the C-K near-edge spectrum confirms the typical graphitic network with sp2-hybridization where the sharp π* band arises at 285 eV, followed by a relatively broad σ* transition starting from 291 eV.45a However, K-edge peaks at 532 eV, which are associated with oxygen groups,45b are different at different locations. A small oxygen K-edge peak can be observed at 532 eV for location 2, a large one for location 3, and between for location 1. This indicates that graphene sheets contain heterogeneously distributed oxygen groups, leading to a defect structure. The defect structure of CFG was further evaluated by Raman spectroscopy. This is because the D band at 1350 cm−1 can be used to identify disordered sp2 carbon (induced by the linking with sp3 carbon atoms) and the G band at 1580 cm−1 employed to measure graphite-like sp2 carbon.46a As shown in Fig. 1B, one can see a G peak at around 1580 cm−1 and a D peak at 1350 cm−1, indicating the presence of both sp2 and sp3 bonded carbon atoms of CFG sheets. This is supported by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements (Table S1 in the ESI†). These demonstrated that the CFG sheets possess a highly defected structure, which would be caused by the curving of sheets and oxygen-functional groups.46 This is consistent with SEM, TEM, and EELS observations (Fig. 2). It should be noted that the highly curved shape and rich defects of the 3D graphene could break its long-range-order, resulting in the absence of observable diffraction patterns in its X-ray and electron diffraction measurements. Furthermore, the oxygen content of the cauliflower-fungus-like graphene was determined by EDS and elemental analysis. As shown in Table 1, one can see that the oxygen content (2–12%) of CFG decreased with increasing synthesis temperature from 500 to 650 °C (note: CFG samples prepared at 500, 550, 600, and 650 °C were denoted as CFG-500, CFG-550, CFG-600, and CFG-650, respectively). Because the oxygen groups created defects for graphene sheets, the conductivity of graphene would increase with decreasing oxygen content. Indeed, the sheet resistance of the 20 μm graphene film on bare glass decreased from 40.5 to 8.1 kΩ sq−1 with increasing synthesis temperature of CFG (Table 2). In contrast, graphene synthesized via the chemical exfoliation of graphite (CEG) followed by reduction has a large sheet resistance of 64 kΩ sq−1 (Table 2). This indicates that CFG sheets have a much higher conductivity than CEG graphene sheets. In addition, BET surface areas are 230, 462, 450, and 106 m2 g−1 for CFG-500, CFG-550, CFG-600, and CFG-650, respectively (Table 2). This indicates that the surface area of CFG increased and then decreased with increasing synthesis temperature. Furthermore, the surface area of CFG is much larger than that (13 m2 g−1) of CEG graphene. Therefore, the high conductivity and the large surface area of CFG would constitute its excellent candidate as an electrode material, which was explored as a DSSC counter electrode as follows.

DSSCs were fabricated using a N719 dye sensitized TiO2 film on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass plate as a photoelectrode, I3−/I− based liquid as an electrolyte, and CFG coated on a (FTO) glass plate as a counter electrode. The characteristic J–V curves of the DSSCs using CFG counter electrodes are shown in Fig. 3A and the photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 3. The CFG-600 counter electrode created the best DSSC that exhibited a short-circuit current density (Isc) of 19.04 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.79 V, fill factor (FF) of 0.54, and power conversion efficiency (η) of 8.07% under illumination of AM1.5 simulated sunlight with a power density of 100 mW cm−2. This efficiency is 10 times higher than that (0.7%) of the DSSC with the CEG graphene counter electrode. Furthermore, it is even better than that (7.5%) of a DSSC with a Pt counter electrode (Fig. S2 in the ESI†).

It is well-known that the energy conversion efficiency of a DSSC is proportional to both the conductivity and the catalytic activity of its counter electrode.44 When the CFG synthesis temperature increased from 500 to 600 °C, its conductivity increased (reflected by the decrease in its sheet resistance) (Table 2), leading to the increase in the energy conversion efficiency of the DSSCs (Table 3). However, when the synthesis temperature of CFG further increased to 650 °C (which enhanced its conductivity), the efficiency of CFG-based DSSCs decreased. This indicates that the decrease in the efficiency with increasing CFG synthesis temperature cannot be attributed to the change of CFG conductivity. In other words, it would be caused by the decrease of catalytic activity associated with the surface area. A large decrease of surface area with increasing synthesis temperature from 600 to 650 °C would be responsible for the decrease in the efficiency. This was supported by the evaluation of electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS). Two semicircles were observed in the frequency range of 0.1–100 kHz for all samples (Fig. 3B) and electrochemical parameters are summarized in Table 3. The intercept of the first semicircle represents the ohmic serial resistance (Rs) related to the intrinsic resistance of assembled cells. The first semicircle corresponds to the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the CE/electrolyte interface, which is inversely proportional to the catalytic ability of the CE for the reduction of I3− to I−, whereas the semicircle in the lower frequency region is associated with the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN) of the I3−/I− couple.47 Almost the same value of Rs for all CFG-based DSSCs indicates the negligible effect of Rs on the photovoltaic performance (Table 3). However, as the synthesis temperature of CFG increased, the values of Rct and ZN decreased to reach the minimum values at CFG-600 and then increased (Table 3). This can explain why CFG-600 exhibited the highest efficiency. Furthermore, the DSSC with the CEG graphene counter electrode has a very large Rct (2500 Ω) and ZN (104 Ω), explaining its negligible power conversion efficiency (Table 3). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were also exploited to evaluate CFG-based counter electrodes. As shown in Fig. 3C, one can see two pairs of oxidation and reduction peaks associated with the I3−/I− redox pair. It was demonstrated that the electro-catalytic activity is proportional to the peak current density and inversely proportional to the peak-to-peak separation (Epp) of Aox and Ared peaks.48 The CFG-600 counter electrode showed the highest current density (1.532 mA cm−2) and the smallest Epp (0.225 V) among four CFG graphene electrodes, indicating the best electrocatalytic activity. Furthermore, incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves show the best conversion efficiency of a DSSC with the CFG-600 counter electrode (Fig. 3D). The CV and IPCE evidence further supports the results of J–V and EIS measurements.
Conclusions
In conclusion, 3D cauliflower-fungus-like graphene (CFG) with high conductivity and excellent catalytic activity can be synthesized via a simple reaction between the Li liquid and CO2 gas. Furthermore, the CFG exhibited excellent performance as a counter electrode for a DSSC, leading to an energy conversion efficiency as high as 8.1%, which is 10 times higher than that (0.7%) of the DSSC with a counter electrode of regular graphene synthesized via chemical exfoliation of graphite followed by reduction. The efficiency is even better than that (7.5%) of a DSSC with an expensive Pt counter electrode. This would provide a novel approach not only to synthesize free-standing 3D graphene for solar cells, but also to control CO2 emission.
