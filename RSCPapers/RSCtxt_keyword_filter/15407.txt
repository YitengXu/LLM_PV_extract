    , Accepted 27th March 2012First published on 2nd April 2012AbstractA multilayer TiO2 nanorod-assembled cloth/nanorod array based electrode was fabricated by transferring different layers of TiO2 nanorod-assembled cloth (TNRC) onto nanorod array grown on the conducting FTO substrate (titania nanorod, TNR). Combining the superior electron transport characteristics of TNR and outstanding optical properties of TNRC, the nanostructured electrode composed of two layers of TNRC meets the optimized design for high quality dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) and self-powered UV detectors. The highest efficiency of 4.02% for DSC under AM 1.5 was achieved with a high short circuit current density of 9.81 mA cm−2, which was proved to be owing to the enhanced dye anchoring, light scattering and reduced charge recombination. For the photoelectrochemical (PEC) UV detector, the highest quantum efficiency of over 46% was obtained and a high photocurrent response of 0.271 mA cm−2 was observed, together with the excellent self-powered, fast response and “visible blind” characteristics. A perfect linear response to the changed low-power signal indicates great potential for practical applications.
Introduction
Multilayer nanostructured devices have attracted great interest in recent years for the great advantages in device performance optimization. Each nanostructure has its unique superiority, for example, 1D nanowire devices have been widely investigated due to its fast electron transport properties.1,2 Nanoparticles or quantum dots with large surface area and specific optical properties have been used to fabricate optoelectronic device.3,4 Research focusing on the hierarchical self-assembled nanomaterials also confirm their predominance in device applications.5 Developing multilayer hierarchical devices is an extremely effective way by combining all the advantages of each component together to meet the optimized design and achieve excellent performance. As plenty of work focusing on this point have already been reported and achieved exciting progress,6,7 it will provide great opportunities by making good use of our imagination to promote high quality device development.
As one of the new emerging photovoltaic family members, photoelectrochemical cells (PEC) have made great achievements in the world of incident photon to current conversion.8 Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSC), which are considered as third generation solar cells, are leading a huge revolution owing to their low-cost fabrication and high conversion efficiency.9,10 High response PEC photodetectors with excellent wavelength selective properties are also a hot issue that arouse more and more interest nowadays, especially self-powered devices which can function well without an external power source.11 Due to such great advantages, this kind of detector could be conveniently made into mini-devices and are facile for practical application. Therefore, a lost-cost process for developing high performance PEC solar cells and self-powered photodetectors is urgently needed.
In order to fabricate nanostructured devices, thin film techniques including chemical vapor deposition, magnetic sputtering technology, atomic layer deposition, arc discharge, sputtering, printing, etc.12–14 are developed. However, a high cost super-clean environment is needed or otherwise huge damage to the microstructure can often accompany these techniques, resulting in sacrifice of the device performances. As a new and efficient way to make high performance devices, the membrane transferring technique successfully avoids the above flaws and meets the demand of some special applications such as flexible devices.15,16
In this paper, we fabricated high performance DSC and self-powered UV detectors by introducing novel multilayer nanostructured electrodes, which are composed of transferred multilayered TiO2 nanorod-assembled cloths (TNRC) and TiO2 nanorod array (TNR) deposited FTO substrate. Such multilayer nanostructured electrodes combined the features of fast electron transport and good light capturing properties of each component. By adjusting the number of transferred TNRC layers, we achieved the optimized structure design for both DSC and self-powered UV detector applications. Based on the simple device fabrication process and the optimized structure design techniques, we believe that the current interesting multilayer nanostructures may lead to a great revolution in the optoelectronic field in the future.
Experimental section
Fabrication of photoanode with hierarchical nanostructure
In order to fabricate the composite photoanode of TNRC/TNR structures, we first prepared pure TiO2 cloths based on our previous work15 and TiO2 nanorods arrays grown on FTO substrates according to previous reports,17,18 respectively. Then we gently put a small piece of TiO2 cloth onto the prepared FTO glass with TNR grown on and lightly pressed them to form good contact between the two structures. Subsequently, a drop of Ti-isopropoxide (0.1 M in ethanol) was applied to this structure. After drying for several hours in air, the TiO2 electrodes were annealed at 500 °C for 2 h to induce crystallinity, which can be further enhanced by subsequent TiCl4 post treatment and annealing again. Finally, the composite TNRC/TNR photoanode was obtained and this treatment can also be used to prepare the photoanodes ready for the device application.
Materials characterization
The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images were obtained with a FEI Sirion 200 (10 kV) and JEOL JSM-6700F (5 kV). The transmittance and absorption were investigated by a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotometer.
Dye-sensitized solar cell characterization
The prepared TNRC/TNR photoanode was immersed into N719 (0.5 mM in ethanol) solution and sensitized overnight and then washed with absolute ethanol to remove the unanchored dye molecules. The counter electrode was platinized by coating with a drop of isopropanol solution of H2PtCl6 followed by annealing at 400 °C for 20 min and repeating the whole process again. Then the photoanode and cathode were sandwiched using thermoplastic ‘Surlyn’ as a spacer, followed by injecting electrolyte containing DMPII (1.0 M), LiI (0.1 M), I2 (0.12 M), and 4-TBP (0.5 M) in methoxypropionitrile via a vacuum filling method to finish the DSC fabrication. Photocurrent and electrochemical impedance measurements were done under AM1.5G (Newport) conditions and with an Autolab (model AUT84315), respectively, with automatic data acquisition, and IPCE was measured by an IPCE testing system (Newport).
UV photodetector characterization
The process for UV detector fabrication was almost the same as that for DSC, except for directly using the none-sensitized photoanode. All measurements were performed using an Autolab (model AUT84315) introducing an ultraviolet hand lamp with a power density of 1.55 mW cm−2 (λ = 365/254 nm switchable) and an Oriel 500W xenon lamp source equipped with a monochromator as light source.
Results and discussion
Properties of the multilayer TiO2 cloths/TiO2 nanorod arrays electrode
Rutile TiO2 nanorod arrays on the FTO substrates were synthesized by the previous reported method using toluene as solvent. Highly ordered arrays with relatively high density were obtained from the method and the cross section SEM image is shown in Fig. 1a. The length of the nanorods is measured to be around 2 μm with diameters ranging from 10–30 nm, which can be further confirmed from the top section view in Fig. 1b. Fig. 1c displays the texture structure of the rutile TiO2 cloth synthesized from our previously reported microwave-assisted hydrothermal method.15 The cloth-shaped microstructure is woven orderly by hollow fibers (Fig. 1d) which consist of a large amount of nanorods on the surface with a length of 1–2 μm and a diameter of approximately 200 nm (inset of Fig. 1d).

Because of the superior transferability of the TNRC, as can be seen from the inset image of Fig. 1e, the hierarchical TNRC/TNR structures can be conveniently fabricated through the process vividly described in Fig. 1e. First, a piece of the TNRC was transferred onto the surface of the TNR. Then a drop of Ti-isopropoxide solution is applied onto the hierarchical structure to function as glue. After annealing at high temperature and post treatment with TiCl4, an excellent adhesion layer formed between the two structures and can be directly applied into device applications. The optical properties of a device are quite important for optoelectronic device applications. The highly ordered TNR on FTO substrate have outstanding electron transport characteristics so that the generated photoelectrons can travel extremely fast to the contact.18 However, due to the relatively lower film thickness and nanorod density comparing to the traditional nanoparticle film, a large proportion of the photons will become transmission loss. The use of the hierarchical TNRC/TNR structures clearly avoids the above problem because the TNRC consists of a great number of woven hollow fibres with numerous nanorods on their surface. Strong light scattering properties were obtained as many diffuse reflection centers were formed inside the network and thus greatly reduce the transmittance loss.19 As revealed in Fig. 1f, the optoelectronic device with TNRC/TNR structures can achieve high light utilization and the increased amount of freshly generated photoelectrons are delivered quickly to the FTO contact and produce electricity. Such a simple fabrication process including low temperature hydrothermal method and easy film transfer technique is believed to open up new vistas for making lost-cost, large area, high performance optical electronic devices, and also creating great opportunities for further industrialization.
In order to prove the scattering properties of TNRC, we investigated the UV-Vis transmittance spectra of five different electrodes: TNR, one layer of TNRC directly transferred on FTO (TNRC), one layer of TNRC on TNR (TNRC/TNR), two layers of TNRC adhered to TNR one by one (2TNRC/TNR), three layers of TNRC on TNR (3TNRC/TNR). The corresponding results are shown in Fig. 1g. From these curves, it can be seen that TNR photoelectrode suffers from around 40–60% transmittance loss in the wavelength range of 400–750 nm which is a disaster for the device and limits the performance as we supposed formerly. When a layer of TNRC was transferred onto TNR, a huge decrease can be observed for the transmittance loss. In addition, a red shift of the curve compared to TNR indicates the increased diffuse reflection for the light in longer wavelength region of around 400 nm. Such phenomena have already been proved as typical functions for scattering layers in the previous research.19 At the same time, photons with wavelengths greater than 600 nm which escaped from the TNR electrode were also limited when changing the condition of TNRC/TNR. As a result, it provides the opportunities for devices to make good use of the near infrared light. Besides, the difference between TNRC and TNRC/TNR for the spectrum is negligible except for the UV region less than 400 nm, where TNRC/TNR shows less transmission loss. It indicates a better device performance in the short wavelength region. We conclude that this phenomenon is caused by the light diffuse reflection back to TNR, which leads to repetitious absorption when applied to the structure combination. When the film is made thicker by attaching another one or more pieces of TNRC, the transmission loss for 2TNRC/TNR and 3TNRC/TNR exhibited only slight decrease with the shapes of such curves remaining almost the same, indicating quite similar optical properties.
TiO2 nanorod cloth/nanorod array photoanodes for DSC application
Due to the superiority of excellent electron transport and light harvesting abilities, a hierarchical structure was used for the photoanode for DSC applications. In order to optimize the cell performance, we investigated the performances of five different photoanodes, TNR, TNRC, TNRC/TNR, 2TNRC/TNR, and 3TNRC/TNR, in detail. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured under standard AM 1.5 illumination. The corresponding results are shown in Fig. 2a and the corresponding parameters are displayed in Table 1. From the table, we found that although 3TNRC/TNR exhibited the least transmittance loss as shown above, we achieved best device performance by using 2TNRC/TNR as photoanode, with the highest efficiency of 4.02% with a relatively high short current density (Jsc) of 9.81 mA cm−2 and an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.73 V. From the obtained dye-loading ability by desorbing the anchored dye molecule in dilute NaOH (0.1 M) solution and measuring the absorption spectrum of each photoanode compared with the standard N719 solution, we conclude that the highest Jsc for 2TNRC/TNR is due to the larger amount of dye adsorption compared with the other photoanodes. Besides, although 3TNRC/TNR exhibited the best dye loading ability, it exhibited a relatively low device performance, which could be caused by the enlarged carrier transport distance as the film becomes thicker and a much more serious interface recombination between each layer.20 In fact, in our case, the third layer of TNRC is hard to achieve good adherence and easy to peel off during the dye sensitizing process. Thus, the poor mechanical strength between layers also limits the performance of the 3TNRC/TNR photoanode.

Incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) is an important measurement for photovoltaic testing, which can directly reflect cells' spectral response. Fig. 2b shows the IPCE curves for the above five photoanodes. The quantum efficiency dominates the Jsc under each wavelength of radiation known as:21 Jsc (λ) = qηIPCE (λ) I0(1)where q is the elementary charge, ηIPCE (λ) is the quantum efficiency under each light wavelength and I0 is the illuminated light intensity. The whole short circuit current can be easily obtained by integrating eqn (1). High short current density means high quantum efficiency, according to which quite a good match could be observed between the order of IPCE and J–V curves. The highest external quantum efficiency of 2TNRC/TNR is approximately 43.8% at the wavelength of 530 nm by measuring Jsc(λ) and calculating it according to the following equation: EQE = 1240SR(λ)/λ(2)
In this equation, SR(λ) describes the spectral response at each wavelength. Divided by the FTO transmittance rate of about 78.6%, the internal quantum efficiency achieved is as high as 55.7%. Therefore, the performance could be seriously limited unless highly transparent conducting oxide (TCO) glass is used. The whole quantum efficiency is governed by three factors: the light harvesting efficiency (ηlh), the charge injection efficiency (ηinj), and the charge collection efficiency (ηcc). The relation among them is expressed by:22 ηIPCE = ηlhηinjηcc(3)
As the light harvest efficiency ηlh is the most susceptible to wavelength among those factors, higher dye loading ability represents high photon–electron conversion efficiency. As all of the five photoanodes are sensitized by N719, the ηinj can be seen as a constant. So the factor limiting the performance of 3TNRC/TNR must be the low ηcc determined by the disadvantageous competition between recombination and charge collection. Compared to TNR photoanode, the enhanced IPCE value caused by the transferred TNRC layer for TNRC/TNR not only occurs at the maximum absorption wavelength of nearly 530 nm, but can also be clearly noticed at the long wavelength region over 600 nm, which is caused by the light scattering effect, improving the light harvesting for the photons with lower energy.6 The effect of scattering light can be further confirmed in Fig. 2c, which draws the curves of the total transmission loss for the encapsulated DSC. From these curves, we found that for the cell containing TNR photoelectrode, the highest optical loss occurs at nearly 650 nm, resulting in a wide spectral absorption range. It perfectly fits the IPCE result and confirms a superior light scattering ability for those hierarchical structure devices.
In order to undertake a deep investigation on the recombination properties, we introduced the electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) testing under AM 1.5 illumination with open circuit voltage bias to analyze the electron transport information between interfaces. Fig. 2d displays the Bode phase plots, from which we can get the characteristic peak frequency fpeak for the five DSCs, as shown in Table 2. The electron lifetime (τ) can be estimated according to the expression:23 τ ≈ 1/ωpeak = 1/(2πfpeak)(4)

The lowest characteristic peak frequency for TNR represents the highest electron lifetime. Therefore, it proves the outstanding electron collection property of the 1D nanorod arrays. However, as for the catastrophic poor dye absorption, the efficiency is rather low for the TNR cell. The short lifetime of the TNRC photoanode is caused by the bad contact between the TCO substrate, leading to enhanced recombination among the interfaces. Table 2 also shows that when the 2TNRC/TNR structure was used as photoanode, the superior light harvesting and good electron collection properties, combined together, contribute to the highest efficiency, which meets the global optimization for the hierarchical nanostructured DSC photoanode design.
The Nyquist curves for the EIS testing (inset of Fig. 2d) show a great difference between the serious resistance (Rs) values for the DSCs made of only transferred TNRC and the other photoanodes with TNR underlayer. For TNR, the Rs is measured to be as low as 20.6 Ω, which is almost the same as that of FTO glass, indicating the perfect contact of the photoelectrode. Good contacts were also formed between TNR and TNRC nanostructures by using the transferred method, derived from the fact that approximately the same Rs values are observed for TNRC/TNR, 2TNRC/TNR and 3TNRC/TNR. For TNRC, a much higher Rs value of over 31 Ω due to poor contact, leading to a very poor fill factor of only 41.8%.24 The lower fill factor for 3TNRC/TNR also confirmed the poor attachment existing between the third TNRC layer and the others.
The EIS analysis above has qualitatively described the electron transport characteristic and approximately estimated the electron lifetime. To further confirm the results, we introduced the open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) method by measuring the dynamic relaxation when changing the environment from AM 1.5 illumination to dark. The Voc during the decay process can be expressed as:25 (5)where EFn and EF0 stand for the quasi-equilibrium state under AM 1.5 condition and the dark equilibrium state, respectively. n is the free electron concentration in TiO2 nanostructure, n0 is the electron concentration in dark condition, KB is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10−23 J K−1), T is the absolute temperature, and e is the elementary charge. We can easily measure the logarithmic change of the free charge concentration which is defined as the modified recombination rate (Rk) according to the formula: (6)
The original testing plot obtained according to the OCVD method are shown in Fig. S1,† which can be transformed through eqn (6) to get the transient Rk in the dark (Fig. 3a). It reveals that the initial values of the five different DSCs are increasing by the order of TNR, 2TNRC/TNR, TNRC, TNRC/TNR and 3TNRC/TNR, corresponding to a reduction sequence of electron lifetime as the recombination rate equals the reciprocal of τ. It further confirms the excellent carrier transport ability of TNR and 2TNRC/TNR photoanodes.
 Fig. 3  (a) Modified charge recombination rate of different samples using OCVD method. Fitting results of (b) interfacial recombination resistance, (c) chemical capacitance and (d) electron lifetime of different samples under different bias applied in the dark condition. 
In order to make comparisons among the different samples, we investigated the EIS under dark condition at different bias ranges from −0.6 V to −0.85 V so that the interference caused by the electron injection from sensitizer to semiconductor can be ignored. The Nyquist plots of different photoanodes at each bias are shown in Fig. S2.† In these cells, electrons provided by the external circuit are transported through TiO2 network and react with I3−. The semicircle in the middle frequency range represents the interfacial charge recombination process between TiO2 and electrolyte. It becomes smaller for each sample as more negative potential is applied, which is caused by the increased electron concentration when the Fermi level in TiO2 gets closer to the lower edge of the conduction band and thus leads to a decreasing recombination resistance (Rrec).26 The simplified equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. S2† by introducing two constant phase elements (CPE) instead of the capacitance elements to better fit the non-ideal semicircle. The impedance value of CPE is defined by:27 (7)where T is the magnitude and the exponent p is a measure for the ideality of the capacitive part of the CPE. When p = 1, the CPE will be equal to a capacitance and display an ideal semicircle Nyquist plot, whilst a depressed semicircle is produced for 0 < p < 1. The equivalent chemical capacitance (Cμ) which indicates an equilibrium property that relates the variation of the carrier density to the displacement of the Fermi level can be defined as (8)where n = p and Q = T1/n, and according to the equivalent circuit and eqn (8) we conveniently obtained the Rrec and Cμ under different bias and made plots shown in Fig. 3b and c. The whole Rrec value for TNR is much higher than others which means the strongest ability to prevent interfacial recombination. Then the second lowest chance for recombination is believed to happen in the 2TNRC/TNR cell, which also confirms the best transport property among these hierarchical structural photoanodes. In Fig. 3c, all the values for Cμ are positive and therefore prove equilibrium property for all the devices.23 Finally we can calculate the time constant by eqn (9):28 τ = RrecCμ(9)
The result shown in Fig. 3d is perfectly consistent with the previous argument. Due to the excellent characteristics for reducing the charge recombination between semiconductor and electrolyte interface, TNR exhibits the best electron transport property. However, as for the poor dye anchoring ability, we introduced a novel method for structure design by transferring TNRC to break the light harvesting restriction to improve the DSC efficiency. The hierarchical photoanode structure of 2TNRC/TNR performed the best of all in the competition between the light harvesting and charge recombination.
TiO2 nanorod cloth/nanorod array photoanodes for self-powered photochemical UV detector application
Considering the superior optical performance and the advantage in electron transport of the TiO2 nanorod cloth/nanorods arrays, we brought up a new concept of self-powered photoelectrochemical (PEC) UV photodetector by using unsensitized TiO2 nanorod cloth/nanorods arrays with different cloth layers as the photoanodes. When the nanostructured photoanodes were irradiated by UV light, photons with energy higher than the band gap of TiO2 were transformed from the valence band to the conduction band and formed electron–hole pairs. It is generally accepted that there is no macroscopic electrical field for the nanostructure materials used in PEC. Charge separation takes place at the semiconductor and electrolyte interface by the different transfer rate between electrons and holes instead of the built in electrical field within the space charge layer.29 According to the quite large surface area of nanostructured materials, the electrolyte will establish an intimate contact with nanocrystallites, which will lead to a fast removal of holes in the surface and make the electrons travel more easily in the nanostructured network, thus causing the excellent performance for nanostructured PEC devices. During the light illumination, photocurrent can be continuously regenerated owing to the I−/I3− redox couples. As soon as the electron–hole pairs are created, the holes will be quickly removed by I− described as following: 3I− + 2h+ → I3−(10)
The separated electrons transport through the nanocrystalline network and are collected easily by the contact as the work function of FTO matches the conduction band of TiO2. These electrons form the external electricity and arrive at the counter electrode. The electrolyte will be recovered to I− by the electrons gathered at the cathode owing to the catalysis of Pt, which is ready to remove another hole from the surface of TiO2: I3− + 2e− → 3I−(11)
We first investigated the current response by introducing a continuous 365 nm UV light rectangle pulse with an on–off interval of 50 s at 0 V bias using a 1.55 mW cm−2 hand lamp as light source. A mask with a specific hole area of 0.283 cm2 was applied during measurement to get the photocurrent density value. The photocurrent response rectangle pulse with almost the same height for each sample can be clearly seen from Fig. 4a, indicating a great stability for all the PEC photodevices. From an enlarged time-resolved response pulse shown in Fig. S3,† we measured the peak photocurrent density value (Jpeak), the response (τr) and decay time (τd) of different devices, as can be seen in Table 3. It reveals the higher photoresponse of 0.278 mA cm−2 for 2TNRC/TNR than the other nanostructured devices, consistent with the above discussed DSC results. Thus we believe the optimized structure design of 2TNRC/TNR for highest DSC performance can also lead to a high quality PEC detector for its high light harvesting and charge transport properties. TNRC/TNR and 3TNRC/TNR showing relatively lower response amplitude is caused by the increasing recombination rate. According to the optical properties mentioned above, the reduced performance must be the result of the high transmission loss, which can be improved by introducing the TNRC scattering layers. Combining the good properties of carrier transport with the excellent light scattering, the multilayer nanostructured photoanodes open new vistas for fabricating high quality UV detectors with fast and high response. Besides, as there is no bias applied, this new type of photodetector successfully integrates a power source into a conventional detector known as the self-powered photodetector. This photovoltaic effect is vividly seen in Fig. 4b by measuring the open circuit voltage response under the light on–off rectangle pulse, confirming the self-powered properties of all the PEC detectors.

To get the optimal conditions, we need to know the wavelength selective abilities of the devices, thus IPCE testing was performed and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. 4c and the values were summarized in Table 3. The highest efficiency is achieved for the 2TNRC/TNR PEC detector with a value of 46%, which is much higher than other TiO2 PEC detectors and commercial silicon detectors30 at wavelength of around 360 nm. Although the spectral response range has been slightly widened, it is still narrow enough to meet the “visible blind” property even for the 2TNRC/TNR and the efficiency has been significantly increased.
Besides the strong response to high power light illumination, a high quality photodetector must be able to detect very weak optical signals. It is known that the light source for IPCE testing is a monochromator and the output signal power is only several microwatts (Fig. S4†) with a tiny spot area of around 7 × 1 mm2, which makes it very difficult to be detected. However, from our IPCE result shown in Fig. 4c, we can see that it can be easily detected by using our nanostructured detectors. Fig. 4d shows the corresponding testing curves, which perfectly proves the superior weak power detecting ability of the PEC detectors, especially for the 2TNRC/TNR detector. High stability and response amplitude can also be achieved together with fast on–off optical switch properties.

J–V curves at the dark condition were measured after the above testing (Fig. S5†), which show the conventional diode characteristics and can be expressed as: I = I0[exp(ev/nKBT) − 1](12)where I0 and n represent the saturation current and ideality factor, respectively. When the 1.55 mW cm−2 illumination light was irradiated on the photodetectors, obvious photovoltaic properties are observed (Fig. 5), which agree quite well with the former measurement displayed in Fig. 4a and b. The results further confirmed the self-powered ability and high photocurrent response of all five devices.

Until now, it has still been a great challenge for photodetectors to make quantitative measurement when facing an intensity changeable UV signal, especially in the case of very weak optical signals. In the following part, we demonstrate that, besides the features of high amplitude, fast response and decay, “visible-blind” and self-power properties, the current hierarchical TiO2 nanorod cloth/nanorod arrays also possess great quantitative detection of weak UV signal with changed intensities. Fig. 6 shows the dependence of the short-circuit photocurrent on incident UV-radiation intensity using the wavelength of each array's optimal efficiency under room temperature and low level radiation intensities. We fitted the experiment data plots to a linear dependence. By measuring the slope we can get the power sensitivity for each structured photodetector and find the best performance. The corresponding results were tabulated in Table 4. All the correlation coefficients (K) are over 0.99, indicating the high linear properties of all the PEC detectors, making them ideal candidates for UV radiation level measurement. A larger slope value represents enhanced sensitivity for detecting the changed UV radiation and makes it an important value for judging the device quality. When comparing this parameter with each other, it is clear that the devices with hierarchical photoanode structure combining TNR with TNRC achieved much higher sensitivity to the changing power of radiation. In the mean time, 2TNRC/TNR with its highest slope value among the three multilayer structures turns out to be the optimal structure design for the application of optoelectronic detecting devices.

Conclusions
A novel hierarchical nanostructure photoanode design was proposed for enhanced optoelectronic device performance by transferring different layers of TiO2 nanorod cloth onto TiO2 nanorod array deposited FTO substrate. Due to the outstanding electron transport ability of TNR and the excellent light harvesting of TNRC, the multilayer structured electrode was successfully applied for DSC applications. 2TNRC/TNR, consisting of two layers of TiO2 nanorod cloths, exhibited the best performance with an efficiency of 4.02%, owing to its high dye loading ability, good light scattering and less recombination. We believe that the efficiency should be further improved by either designing better quality TiO2 nanorod arrays, synthesizing more compact cloth structures, or introducing passivation layers. High quality, self-powered, “visible-blind” UV photodetector was also designed with the features of outstanding photovoltaic properties, good ultraviolet selectivity, high, fast (less than 0.3 s) and perfectly linear optical signal response. Considering the simple and cheap fabrication process, scale-up devices for multilayer TiO2 nanorod-assembled cloth/nanorod arrays could be easily realized, which can bring real breakthroughs, opening up new strategies toward flexible, economically cheap, and high performance optoelectronic applications.
