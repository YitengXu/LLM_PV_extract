, Accepted 21st June 2016First published on 22nd June 2016AbstractThe ground state properties of polymers BSeTT, QTT, BDT-DTBTBPz (Pz), BDT-DTBTBQx (Qx) and their derivatives D1, D2, D3, including frontier molecular orbital, energy gaps, ionization potentials (IPs), electron affinities (EAs) and electron or hole reorganization energies, have been investigated with DFT-B3LYP/6-31G(d) method. Based on optimized structures, the absorption and fluorescence spectra of the seven oligomers are simulated with TD-DFT-Cam-B3LYP/6-31G(d) method. The external electric field is taken into account in view of the practical application. Moreover, developed visualized charge difference density is applied to present the charge density redistribution for the fullerene/polymer complexes. More deeply, the electronic coupling matrix, reorganization and Gibbs free energy are estimated to calculate the rates of the charge transfer and recombination for the fullerene/polymer complexes. Results show that the lengths of conjugated chains obviously affect the energy levels of HOMO and LUMO, and the ionization potentials and electron affinities. By evaluating the rates of the charge transfer and recombination for the fullerene/polymer complexes, reorganization energy and spectrum nature, it is found that the molecule BDT-DTBTBPz and designed molecule (D2) have the best optical and electronic properties among the investigated system, indicating that introducing appropriate functional group can effectively improve the photoelectric characteristics.
1. Introduction
In view of the continuous depletion of fossil fuels and the serious environmental pollution, a great deal of attention has been focused on the renewable resources. Solar energy is an abundant, renewable and clean energy source that is one of the most promising energy sources and has recently become virtually practical.1–4 Although commercially available solar cells are currently based on inorganic silicon semiconductors, their large-scale application has been limited due to the expensive, heavy, and inflexible shortcomings. Among all the renewable energy technologies, the polymer solar cells (PSCs) with a mixture of electron donor polymers and electron acceptor fullerene derivatives, are promising cost-effective solar cells because of their potentially low fabrication costs, environmentally friendly components, relatively high conversion efficiencies and flexibility in their manufacture and employment.5–7
In polymer solar cells, the photocurrent are generated after five process:8 (1) the active layer absorbs photons to form excitons; (2) excitons are transported to the donor–acceptor (D–A) interface; (3) excitons are separated at the donor–acceptor interface and form free charges; (4) charges are transported under an electric field; (5) charges are collected by electrodes. There are several factors affecting the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of polymer solar cells: (a) unmatched spectra between the spectral response in polymers system and the sunlight radiation; (b) the lower carrier mobility; and (c) the lower collection efficiency of the carrier by electrode.9–14 The various approaches for the synthesis of highly efficient PSCs have been performed to enhance each process.15–19 You and co-works20 designed and synthesized the two polymers, PCPDT-DFBT and PDTP-DFBT based on PCPDT-BT, in which PDTP-DFBT presented a narrow band gap (1.38 eV), high mobility and deep highest occupied molecular orbital. Moreover, a single-junction device based on PDTP-DFBT showed spectral response extends to 900 nm, with a power conversion efficiency of 7.9% and a certified power conversion efficiency of 10.6% under standard reporting conditions. Chen et al.21 had designed a triple-junction tandem solar cell to improve power conversion efficiency up to 11.5%. Liu et al.22 synthesized a novel two-dimensional (2D) conjugated copolymer 2D PTB7-DT by introducing the conjugated 5-alkylthiophene-2-yl side chain to substitute non-conjugated alkoxy side chain in 1D PTB7, finding that the single-junction PSCs based on 2D PTB7-DT exhibited a PCE of 10.12%. Moreover, some progress has been made in theoretical research.23–31 Nora et al.25 investigated the electronic properties of fluorene-1,3,4-thiadiazole oligomers using DFT-B3LYP/6-31G(d) and demonstrated that the electronic properties were observed to be significantly enhanced as the number of monomeric units increased, which also lead to the decreasing gap energy from 3.51 eV in the oligomer with just one thiadiazole ring to 2.33 eV in the oligomer with 10 units. Ling and co-works27 studied the electronic structure of positive and negative radicals (polarons) of two functionalized DTTzTz materials using multi-frequency and multi-resonance electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) in combination with density functional theory (DFT), and this work gave in-depth information about the spread of the electron or hole in the DTTzTz molecules. Furthermore, Song and coworkers32 investigated the influence of the external electric field on the electronic coupling, the reorganization energy and free energy change of the electron transfer in bulk hetero-junction solar cells, which promoted a deeper understanding of the connection between the external electric field, chemical structure and optical and electronic properties of the donor–acceptor system. In order to improve the power conversion efficiency of polymer solar cells, it is very important to select the appropriate photoactive layer molecules, and they are expected to possess the optical response in visible and near infrared region and obvious charge transfer ability in solar cells.
In this paper, we designed three novel molecules D1, D2, D3 based on the experiment reports.33,34 And the various properties, such as the ground state structures, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), energy gaps (ΔH–L, the difference between the HOMO and LUMO), ionization potential (IP), electron affinity (EA), electron and hole reorganization energy are calculated by the density functional theory (DFT). Moreover, the absorption and emission characteristics are investigated by the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). In addition, the external electric field is taken into account in consideration of the practical application. It is noteworthy that the aforesaid parameters were estimated through a linear extrapolation method.35,36 Visualized charge difference density analysis is used to present the charge density redistribution for fullerene/polymer complexes; the electronic coupling matrix, reorganization and Gibbs free energy are estimated to calculate the rates of charge transfer and recombination. Simulated data show that among the objective molecules, BDT-DTBTBPz molecule exhibits the best properties of the ground and excited states, and the designed molecule (D2) is the second most efficient configuration next to BDT-DTBTBPz. Our results contribute to understanding the structures, photophysical and photochemical properties of photosensitive molecules, and provide a reliable strategy for the design of efficient solar cells.
2. Computational details
The ground state geometries of BSeTT, QTT, BDT-DTBTBPz (Pz), BDT-DTBTBQx (Qx) and their derivatives have been fully optimized by using DFT37,38 method with B3LYP39 functional at the 6-31G(d) basis set. On the basis of optimized ground state structures, we obtained the bond length, dihedral angle, HOMO and LUMO energies, HOMO–LUMO energy gaps, ionization potentials, and electron affinities. The ionization potential and electron affinity were calculated from the difference of neutral and cationic or anionic molecular energies. Furthermore, the absorption and emission spectra were calculated by using TD-DFT40,41 method with Cam-B3LYP42 functional at 6-31G(d) basis set on the basis of optimized ground state and excited state geometries, respectively. To calculate the charge transfer integral (electronic coupling matrix), the Generalized Mulliken–Hush (GMH) model and the finite field method were performed on the donor–acceptor hetero-junction.
Quantum chemical method has been used to study electro-optical and charge transport properties of organic molecules system.43,44 For clear understanding the charge density change, the three dimensional (3D) real-space representation was used to visualize charge transfer on the electronic transition. In the real-space representation, the oscillating collective electron oscillator coordinate and moments are written as,45

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Ground state properties
The structures of the seven oligomers (see Fig. 1) have been optimized by using DFT-B3LYP/6-31G(d) method, and the bond lengths and dihedral angles between each of the two connecting units of the optimized molecular structures at ground state were listed in Tables 1 and S1a–f (see ESI Table S1a–f†). The research showed that the alkyl group only has the solubility of polymers increased, but has no significant effect on their photoelectric properties.51,52 Therefore, in order to save the computational cost, the hydrogen atoms were used in place of alkyl groups in all the molecules in the present paper.

From Tables 1 and S1a–f,† it was found that the most bond lengths between each of the two connecting units are becoming smaller with the increase of conjugated degrees for all molecules. For instance, when the conjugated unit was increased from one unit to three units, for BSeTT the bond lengths between the thieno(3,2-b)thiophene (TT) and benzoselen-adiazole (BSe) units (TT-BSe) are 1.45582, 1.45510 and 1.45507, respectively. Moreover, the other molecules have similar phenomena. However, along with the increasing conjugated units, the distortion degree between each of the two connecting units has changed in various magnitudes. For instance, for TT-BSe units of BSeTT, the dihedral angles are 0.00347°, −0.00699° and 0.05908° for n = 1, 2, 3, respectively. Considering the similar structures of molecules (BSeTT, QTT and the designed molecules D1, D2, D3), we discussed these five molecules together to understand the relations between structure and performance. Compared with the bond lengths and dihedral angles of BSeTT, QTT, D1, D2, D3, it was found that the average bond lengths of D2 is the smallest, and D3 becomes the biggest. The distortion extent of BSeTT is found to be the smallest, and D3 is the biggest. As listed in Tables S1b and c,† for Pz and Qx the bond lengths at same position are decreased along with the increasing conjugated units. For instance, when n = 1, 2, 3, the bond lengths of BDT-T for Pz and Qx are 1.44559, 1.44514, 1.44431 (for Pz) and 1.44394, 1.44380, 1.44225 (Qx), respectively. Moreover, the optimized Pz tends to be planar structure in comparison with the Qx. Therefore, the different functional groups have different effects on the molecular structure and then affect the optical and electrical properties.
3.2. Frontier molecular orbital and energy gaps
To investigate the optical and electronic properties, it is interesting to evaluate the HOMO, LUMO energy level and energy gap of the molecules. The energy levels of HOMO, LUMO and energy gaps ΔH–L of all the oligomers (n = 1, 2, 3) have been calculated by using DFT-B3LYP/6-31G(d) method, and the results were listed in Table 2. Fig. 2a describes the tendency of HOMO, LUMO energy levels with increasing conjugated units. Fig. 2b presents the relationship between energy gaps and the reciprocal of conjugated units, in which energy gaps have a good linear relationship with the reciprocal of conjugated units. Therefore, the energy gaps of polymers (n = ∞) were obtained using extrapolation (see Table 2). The relative order of frontier molecular orbital of these oligomers can provide a reasonable guideline for the study of excitation properties and the hole and electron injection ability.53

 Fig. 2  (a) Energy levels of all oligomers (n = 1–3), where the black line and red line stand for HOMO and LUMO, respectively; (b) the energy gap have a good linear relationship with the reciprocal of conjugated units (1/n). 
From Table 2, it was seen that along with the increasing conjugated units, the HOMO energy levels of seven molecules are increased, and LUMO energy levels become decreased. The tendency can be intuitively displayed in Fig. 2a. Calculated data suggested that with the increase of conjugated units, the abilities of hole and electron injections of all the molecules are improved. When the conjugated unit n = 1, the HOMO energy levels of the seven molecules are in this order: Pz > D2 ≈ Qx > BSeTT ≈ QTT > D1 ≈ D3, and the LUMO energy levels are in this order: Pz < D2 < Qx < BSeTT < D1 < QTT < D3, indicating the ability of hole and electron injection of Pz is the best, and the properties of D2 is next to Pz. In addition, their energy gaps are in this order Pz < D2 < Qx < BSeTT < QTT < D1 < D3, wherein the energy gaps are 1.50 eV for Pz and 1.75 eV for D2, indicating that replacement of the other groups by the quinoxaline unit can effectively reduce the energy gap in the theory. When n = ∞, the energy gaps of seven molecules obtained by extrapolation were in this order: Pz = D2 < Qx < BSeTT < QTT < D1 < D3, and the results for Pz and D2 are 0.96 eV, and that of D3 is 2.55 eV, manifesting that the optical property of polymeric D2 can favorably in comparison with Pz.
3.3. Ionization potentials and electron affinities
The ionization potential and electron affinity can estimate well the injection ability of electrons and holes in molecules,54–57 which in theory can provide a reasonable index for selecting the excellent molecular system on the experiment.57 The calculated ionization potentials and electron affinities of all oligomers were listed in Table 3, and Fig. S1† presented the relationship between the ionization potentials and electron affinities of all oligomers and the reciprocal of conjugated units. As shown in Fig. S1,† the ionization potentials and electron affinities have a good linear relationship with the reciprocal of conjugated units.

From Table 3, it can be seen that with the increasing conjugated units, the ionization potentials of all molecules are decreased, and electron affinities are increased, which indicates that the injection ability of electron and hole for the all oligomers have been improved with the increasing conjugated units. At the same time, when N = 3 for the seven oligomers, the ionization potential of Pz becomes lower than that of the other six molecules, and D2 lies in the second place (4.95 eV, 4.98 eV, 5.04 eV, 5.33 eV, 5.49 eV, 5.49 eV, 5.56 eV for Pz, D2, Qx, QTT, BSeTT, D1, D3, respectively). In the meantime, the electron affinity of Pz is higher than that of the other six molecules, and D2 is second only to Pz (2.93 eV, 2.85 eV, 2.75 eV, 2.33 eV, 2.08 eV, 2.04 eV and 1.77 eV for Pz, D2, Qx, BSeTT, D1, QTT and D3, respectively). This suggested that in these seven molecules, the hole and electron injection ability of Pz were better than that of other molecules.
The ionization potentials and electron affinities of all polymers were obtained by the extrapolation method, and the results were listed in Table 3. As shown in Table 3, the ionization potentials of seven polymers are in this order: Pz < D2 < Qx < QTT < D1 < BSeTT < D3. The results of Pz and D2 are very closed (4.63 eV for Pz and 4.64 eV for D2), respectively, indicating the injection capability of hole for original molecule and D2 are stronger than the others. And the electron affinities in this order: Pz > D2 > Qx > BSeTT > QTT > D1 > D3, in which the results of Pz and D2 are 3.22 eV and 3.17 eV, respectively. The original molecule (BDT-DTBTBPz) has better hole and electron injection capability than the other molecules; among the designed molecules, D2 could be used as an excellent candidate in a mixture system with electron donor polymers and electron acceptor fullerene derivatives.
3.4. Absorption spectra
The electron transfer properties of the seven molecular systems have been calculated with the TD-DFT-Cam-B3LYP/6-31G(d), and the absorption peaks and corresponding oscillator strengths of each monomer were listed in Table 4. Moreover, the absorption peaks and corresponding oscillator strengths of S1 excited state for each oligomers were listed in Table 5.

From Table 4, it can be seen that for all monomers, the state S1 is formed by the electron transferring from HOMO to LUMO, and corresponding absorption peaks are found at 498.34 nm, 409.66 nm, 740.50 nm, 641.87 nm, 400.44 nm, 660.97 nm, 397.08 nm for BSeTT, QTT, Pz, Qx, D1, D2, D3, respectively, in which the maximum absorption peak corresponds to Pz (740.50 nm). It was also found that D3 has a minimum absorption peak at 397.08 nm. Fig. 3a showed the absorption spectra of all monomers. The absorption strengths corresponding to every maximum absorption peak have changed with different degree, and the result showed as follows: D1 > QTT > BSeTT > Qx > Pz > D2 > D3, in which the maximum absorption strength was 0.6706 for D1, and minimum absorption strength was 0.2421 for D3.
 Fig. 3  Absorption spectra of all the oligomers for (a) n = 1 and (b) n = 3. 
Table 5 listed the maximum absorption peaks and corresponding absorption strengths of S1 excited state for each oligomer (n = 1–3) for investigating the effect of conjugated lengths for absorption. Fig. 3b showed the absorption spectra of all tripolymers. In order to compare with the simulated values, the experimental absorption peaks of the original molecules were also listed in Table 5. As shown in Table 5, the simulated values were very close to the experimental values, indicating that the theoretical calculation was reasonable to explain the experimental results. For all oligomers, the maximum absorption peaks and corresponding absorption strengths are increased along with the increasing conjugated units. For instance, the peak values for BSeTT are 498.34 nm, 561.09 nm, 611.81 nm when n = 1, 2, 3, respectively; the corresponding strengths are 0.6012, 1.6299 and 2.6669, respectively. Comparing the maximum absorption peaks of monomers with that of tripolymers, the absorption peaks have the bathochromic shifted about 113.47 nm, 91.39 nm, 145.74 nm, 147.95 nm, 75.74 nm, 216.51 nm, 33.29 nm for BSeTT, QTT, Pz, Qx, D1, D2, D3, respectively. It was indicated that the conjugated units had an obvious influence on the absorption property of D2. For all tripolymers, the maximum absorption peaks are in this order: Pz > D2 > Qx > BSeTT > QTT > D1 > D3, and the corresponding absorption strengths are in this order: D1 > QTT > BSeTT > Qx > Pz > D2 > D3, in which Pz and D2 with quinoxaline unit had the best optical properties.
3.5. Reorganization energies
The reorganization energy can be used to estimate the charge transfer characteristic in organic material. According to the Marcus theory,58 the charge transfer rate can be expressed by the following equation: 
(6)where in the above equation, T is the temperature, Kb is the Boltzmann constant, λ is reorganization energy, ℏ is Plank's constant, and V is the charge transfer coupling constant. Among them, the reorganization energy is divided into two forms: one is the intermolecular reorganization energy, and another is the intramolecular reorganization energy.59,60 For the intermolecular reorganization energy, it originates from the electronic and nuclear polarization/relaxation of the surrounding medium, which is not easy to estimate quantitatively in the solid state.55 The intramolecular reorganization energy can be expressed by the following equation,61 
λe = (E−0 − E−) + (E0− − E0)
(7) 
λh = (E+0 − E+) + (E0+ − E0)
(8)where E+0 (E−0) is the energy of the cation (anion) calculated with the optimized structure of the neutral molecule; E+ (E−) is the energy of the cation (anion) calculated with the optimized cation (anion) structure; E0+ (E0−) is the energy of the neutral molecule calculated at the cationic (anionic) state; E0 is the energy of the neutral molecule at the ground state. The cation (anion) and neutral molecular energies of the seven oligomers (n = 1, 2, 3) were calculated by using DFT-B3LYP/6-31G(d) method, and their reorganization energies of hole and electron were obtained by using above equation (the calculated results were listed in Table 6). Because of the limited computing power, the hole reorganization energies of D3 (n = 1) and Pz (n = 3) could not be figured out. From Table 6, it can be seen that, along with the increase of conjugated units (n = 1, 2, 3), the electron reorganization energies of all oligomers are decreased gradually except for D2, in which the electron reorganization energies of D2 are increased gradually with the increasing conjugated units; the electron reorganization energies of all oligomers for n = 2 are in this order: Qx < Pz < BSeTT < D3 < D2 < D1 < QTT, indicating that different functional groups had discrepant effect on the electron transfer ability. For hole reorganization energies, that of D2 exhibits an extraordinary tendency, i.e., it is firstly increased and then decreased. While for the other six molecules, the hole reorganization energies are decreased along with increasing conjugated units; when n = 2, the order of hole reorganization energies are: Pz < Qx < BSeTT < QTT < D2 < D1 < D3. Noted that the low reorganization energies of hole and electron are helpful for charge transport in organic molecular layers.54,55 The Pz has lower hole reorganization energy of electron and hole in original molecules, indicating the characteristics of the bipolar charge transport; while for designed molecules, D2 with lower hole reorganization energy is suitable for hole transport.

3.6. Emission properties
The emission properties of the molecules were obtained based on the excited state structure optimizations by using TD-DFT-Cam-B3LYP/6-31G(d), and the calculation were summarized in Table 7. From Table 7, the fluorescence energies of each oligomer are decreased with growth of conjugated degree, and the emission spectra of all the monomers are formed by electrons transferring from HOMO to LUMO. When n = 1, the fluorescence energies of all molecules are in this order: Pz < D2 < Qx < BSeTT < D3 < QTT < D1, and that of all dipolymers have similar tendency.

Furthermore, the radiative lifetime was obtained by using the following equation,62 
(9)where c is the velocity of light, Eflu is the fluorescence transition energy, and f is oscillator strength. The calculated radiative lifetime of all oligomers and dipolymers were listed in Table 7, which shows that along with the increasing conjugated units, the radiative times are decreased in varying degrees. For all oligomers, the radiative lifetimes are in this order: Pz > D2 > Qx > D3 > BSeTT > QTT > D1, in which that of Pz is the longest (the value was 28.841 ns), and second value corresponding to D2 (the value was 26.390 ns), indicating Pz and D2 have higher emission efficiency.
3.7. Effect of external electric field
In the normal operation of solar cells, an electric field between two electrode plates will be produced since there is a current between the two electrode plates, which has an effect on the charge transfer characteristics of the active layer molecules. To get a rigorous research, the effect of external electric field on the photoelectric properties of the active layer molecules was investigated theoretically. The maximum absorption peaks and corresponding oscillator strengths for S1 excited state and the energy levels of the seven monomers under external electric field (F = 1 × 10−3, 2 × 10−3, 3 × 10−3 a.u.) were listed in Tables S2 and S3,† respectively. Due to the limited computing power, the transition properties and energy levels of BSeTT, Qx (n = 2, 3) and D1 (n = 3) were not obtained. From Table S2,† it can be seen that with the increasing electric field, the absorption peaks of QTT, Pz, D2 and D3 have a red-shift in vary degree. Comparing with the transition properties under no external electric field, the absorption peaks of the seven monomers under F = 1 × 10−3 a.u. have a red-shift about 2.15 nm, 2.61 nm, 33.82 nm, 19.72 nm, 4.63 nm, 1.31 nm and 3.36 nm for BSeTT, QTT, Pz, Qx, D1, D2 and D3, respectively, and the results imply that the electric field had a prominent effect on the photoelectric performance of Pz. It can be seen from Table S3† that the HOMO energy levels of the seven monomers are increased with the increasing external electric field. Moreover, except for D2, the LUMO energy levels of the other six monomers are decreased along with the increasing external electric field. The above results show that the external electric field has an effect on the optical and electrical properties of the active layer molecules.63–66
3.8. Optical absorption of PC60BM/polymers
The calculated transition energies and oscillator strengths of thirty excited states for PC60BM/polymers were listed in Tables S4–S10,† and the charge difference densities of PC60BM/polymers were shown in Fig. S2–S8.† It can be seen from Fig. S2† that for PC60BM/BSeTT, the excited states are divided into five kinds of excitation: (a) a typical local-excited state (S3), for which the intramolecular charge transfer takes place at the molecular skeleton of BSeTT; (b) the states S1, S2, S4–S13, S15, S17, S18, S20–S22, S25, S27–S29 are local-excited states by exciting PC60BM; (c) the electron–hole pairs are both distributed on BSeTT and PC60BM for S23 and S26 states, respectively; (d) the entire intermolecular charge transfer excited states (S14, S16, S19), which can be considered as a direct charge transfer from donor to acceptor, leading to the charge separation; (e) the electron and hole are entirely located on BSeTT and PC60BM for the state S30, respectively. The strongest absorption peak of PC60BM/BSeTT corresponds to S3 excited state with f = 0.5180, and the lowest intermolecular charge transfer excited state was S14 state, peaking at 404.54 nm (see Table S4†). For PC60BM/QTT, the charge difference density in Fig. S3† presented three kinds of excited state: (a) the entire intramolecular charge transfer states of QTT (S13, S23, S27) and (b) PC60BM (S1–S12, S14, S15, S17, S20–S22, S24–S26, S28, S29); (c) the entire intermolecular charge transfer states (S16, S18, S19, S30). The strongest absorption peak of PC60BM/QTT corresponded to the S13 excited state with f = 0.4922, and the lowest intermolecular charge transfer excited state was the S16 state, peaking at 393.49 nm (see Table S5†). For PC60BM/Pz, it can be seen from Fig. S4† that the charge difference density of PC60BM/Pz shown four different distributions: (a) a local-excited state of Pz (S1, S9, S17, S23, S26, S28, S29) and (b) PC60BM (S2–S5, S7, S10–S13, S15, S18, S19, S22); (c) an intermolecular charge transfer excited state (S6, S14, S24, S25, S27, S30); (d) the states which electron–hole pairs both located on PC60BM and Pz molecules (S8, S16, S20, S21). The strongest absorption peak of PC60BM/Pz corresponded to the S1 excited state with f = 0.4166, and the lowest intermolecular charge transfer excited state was the state S6, peaking at 466.77 nm (see Table S6†). For PC60BM/Qx, the charge difference density in Fig. S5† shown five different distribution: (a) a local-excited state of Qx (S1, S8, S18, S29) and (b) PC60BM (S2–S7, S13, S15, S19, S22, S25); (c) an intermolecular charge transfer excited state (S9, S10, S24); (d) the electron–hole pairs both distributed on PC60BM and Qx molecules (S11, S12, S14, S16, S17, S20, S21, S26–S28, S30); (e) electrons and holes were distributed on the Qx and PC60BM, respectively. The strongest absorption peak of PC60BM/Qx corresponded to the S29 excited state with f = 0.5663, and the lowest intermolecular transfer excited state was the state S9, peaking at 449.23 nm (see Table S7†). For PC60BM/D1, the charge difference density in Fig. S6† revealed four kinds of excited state: (a) a local-excited state of D1 (S20, S21) and (b) PC60BM (S1–S12, S15, S16, S19, S23, S24, S26, S27, S29, S30); (c) an intermolecular charge transfer excited state (S17, S18, S22, S25, S28); (d) the electron–hole pairs both distributed on PC60BM and D1 molecules (S13, S14). The lowest intermolecular transfer excited state was the state S17, peaking at 376.41 nm, and the strongest absorption peak of PC60BM/D1 corresponded to the excited state S13 with f = 0.3940 (see Table S8†). For PC60BM/D2, the charge difference density in Fig. S7† presented five kinds of charge distribution: (a) a local-excited state of D2 (S1, S18, S22, S23) and (b) PC60BM (S2–S5, S7, S10, S14–S17, S19–S21, S28, S30); (c) an intermolecular charge transfer excited state (S6, S8, S11); (d) the electron–hole pairs both distributed on PC60BM and D2 molecules (S9, S12, S13, S24–S26); (e) electrons and holes were distributed on the D2 and PC60BM, respectively. The strongest absorption peak of PC60BM/D2 corresponded to the S1 excited state with f = 0.3754, and the lowest intermolecular transfer excited state was the state S6, peaking at 473.70 nm (see Table S9†). For PC60BM/D3, the charge difference density in Fig. S8† presented four kinds of charge distribution: (a) a local-excited state of D3 (S14, S17, S27) and (b) PC60BM (S1–S13, S15, S24, S25, S28–S30); (c) an intermolecular charge transfer excited state (S18–S23, S26); (d) the electron–hole pairs both distributed on PC60BM and D3 molecules (S16). The strongest absorption peak of PC60BM/D2 corresponded to the S17 excited state with f = 0.3206, and the lowest intermolecular transfer excited state was the state S18, peaking at 379.10 nm (see Table S10†).
3.9. Rate of charge transfer
Basing on the PC60BM/polymer model, charge transfer integral, free energy change as well as the rate of charge transfer and recombination for electron transfer reaction were calculated by using TD-DFT method.
At first, the charge transfer integrals (electronic coupling matrix) of PC60BM/polymer systems were estimated by using the Generalized Mulliken–Hush (GMH) model.67 In the two-state (S0 and Sn states) equation: 
(10)where μtr is the calculated transition dipole moment, Δμ is the dipole moment difference between the initial and final electronic states, and ΔE is the vertical excitation energy. The μtr is calculated by adopting the following equation:  (a.u.), where x, y, z are the components of the transition electronic dipole moment corresponding to the fully charged separation state under the electric field intensity being zero. The Δμ in the above equation is obtained by using the Hellmanne Feynman theorem, as the analytical derivative of excited state energy under the applied electric field. According to the eqn (10), the charge transfer integral VDA is calculated. For the PC60BM/polymer system, the first charge transfer state for PC60BM/polymer corresponding to the pure intermolecular charge transfer excited state identified as the fully charged separation state, pointed to the final state in order to obtain the electronic coupling (CT state in Fig. 4). The transition energy dependent on the static field F can be expressed as,68 
(11)where Eexc(0) = ΔE is the excitation energy at zero field, Δα is the change in the polarizability. The calculated values of Δμ for the PC60BM/polymer systems are listed in Table 8, and the values of Δμ were −3.99 a.u., −2.485 a.u., −6.007 a.u., −32.08036 a.u., 6.13214 a.u., −2.79286 a.u. and −6.8 a.u. for PC60BM/BSeTT, PC60BM/QTT, PC60BM/Pz, PC60BM/Qx, PC60BM/D1, PC60BM/D2 and PC60BM/D3, respectively. According to eqn (10), the calculated charge transfer integrals are 0.2008 eV, 0.233 eV, 0.01045 eV, 0.008082 eV, 0.1181 eV, 0.2169 eV and 0.1832 eV for PC60BM/BSeTT, PC60BM/QTT, PC60BM/Pz, PC60BM/Qx, PC60BM/D1, PC60BM/D2 and PC60BM/D3, respectively.

For the exciton dissociation and charge recombination, ΔG = ΔGCT and ΔGCR, respectively. The ΔGCR can be calculated by using the following equation,69 
ΔGCR = EIP(D) − EEA(A)
(12)where EIP(D) is the ionization potential of the donor, EEA(A) is the electron affinity of the acceptor. These quantities were normally estimated from the energies of the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of the donor and acceptor, respectively.62 The calculated ΔGCR of the seven PC60BM/polymer systems were listed in Table 9, and the values were negative, indicating that the process of electron recovery was spontaneous thermodynamically for these seven systems. The ΔGCT was estimated by using the Rehm–Weller equation: ΔGCT = −ΔGCR − ΔE0–0, where ΔE0–0 is the energy of the lowest excited state of free-base donor. In addition to PC60BM/Pz complex, the calculated Gibbs free energy difference ΔGCT of other six complexes were negative, which means that the electron transfer is allowable from point of view of thermodynamics. In addition, the charge transfer and recombination rates were calculated by using the eqn (6) (see Table 9). As shown in Table 9, the charge transfer (CT) rates of the seven systems were in this order: PC60BM/QTT > PC60BM/BSeTT > PC60BM/D3 > PC60BM/D1 > PC60BM/D2 > PC60BM/Qx > PC60BM/Pz. The fast charge transfer rate reflects the higher possibilities of charge transfer from polymer to PC60BM, leading to enhanced electron injection efficiency. By comparing the charge transfer rates of BSeTT, QTT, D1, D2 and D3 (which had similar structures), it revealed that different acceptor units have different effects on the photoelectric properties of polymers. Similarly, the polymer with Qx acceptor unit has better charge transfer rates by comparing the charge transfer rates between PC60BM/Qx and PC60BM/Pz systems. The charge recombination rates (CR) of the seven systems have been calculated as follows: PC60BM/D2 > PC60BM/Pz > PC60BM/Qx > PC60BM/BSeTT > PC60BM/QTT > PC60BM/D3 > PC60BM/D1.

4. Conclusion
In this paper, three molecules D1, D2, D3 were theoretically designed based on the BSeTT, QTT, BDT-DTBTBPz (Pz), BDT-DTBTBQx (Qx). Their frontier molecular orbitals, energy gaps, ionization potentials, electron affinities and the hole or electron reorganization energies have been calculated by using DFT-B3LYP/6-31G(d) method. Moreover, their absorption spectra and fluorescence properties were obtained by using TD-DFT-Cam-B3LYP/6-31G(d) method. Considering the practical application, the effect of external electric field on the optical and electronic properties of molecules was also taken into account. In addition, visualized charge difference density (CDD) analysis was applied to present the charge density redistribution for fullerene/polymer complexes. The electronic coupling matrix, reorganization and Gibbs free energy were estimated to calculate the rates of the charge transfer and recombination of fullerene/polymer complexes. The results show that: (a) with the increasing conjugated lengths, their HOMO energy levels are elevated, and LUMO energy levels are reduced, resulting in the narrow energy gaps; (b) the ionization potentials are gradually decreased, and electron affinities rose with the increasing conjugated units, and the hole or electron reorganization energy decreased; (c) absorption spectra make red-shifted. Charge transfer process are identified by CDD method, showing the charge moves from polymer to PC60BM with the larger rate of CT than CR. Comparison of seven molecules demonstrated that for original and designed molecules, BDT-DTBTBPz and D2 possess narrower band gaps, deeper HOMO energy levels, broader optical absorption spectra, smaller ionization potentials, larger electron affinities and lower reorganization energy. The results indicated the configurations of BDT-DTBTBPz and D2 have the best optical and electronic properties, and the present molecular modeling provided the reasonable theory basis for the design and synthesis of new photoactive layer in solar cells.
