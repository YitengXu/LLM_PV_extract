    , Accepted 4th May 2020First published on 5th May 2020AbstractThe emergence of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites (OHPs) has revolutionised the potential performance of optoelectronic devices; most perovskites are opaque and hence incompatible with transparent optoelectronics and sensitive to environmental degradation. Here, we have reported a single-step fabrication of ultra-long MAPbI3 perovskite microwire arrays over a large area using stencil lithography based on sequential vacuum sublimation. The environmental stability of MAPbI3 is empowered with a newly designed and synthesized transparent supramolecular self-assembly based on a mixture of two tripodal L-Phe-C11H23/C7F15 molecules, which showed a contact angle of 105° and served as ultra-hydrophobic passivation layers for more than 45 days in an ambient atmosphere. The MAPbI3 microwire arrays passivated with the supramolecular self-assembly demonstrated for the first time both excellent transparency of ∼89% at 550 nm and a remarkable photoresponse with a photo-switching ratio of ∼104, responsivity of 789 A W−1, detectivity of 1014 Jones, linear dynamic range of ∼122 dB, and rise time of 432 μs. Furthermore, the photodetector fabricated on a flexible PET substrate demonstrated robust mechanical flexibility even beyond 1200 bending cycles. Therefore, the scalable stencil lithography and supramolecular passivation approaches have the potential to deliver next-generation transparent, flexible, and stable optoelectronic devices.
Introduction
Over the past decade, organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskites (OHPs) have attracted tremendous research interest in optoelectronics1,2 owing to their high absorption coefficient, long carrier diffusion length, high charge carrier mobility, tunable optical band gap, and low manufacturing cost.3,4 These exceptional properties postulate OHPs as an ideal candidate for optoelectronic devices, including light-emitting diodes (LEDs), solar cells and photodetectors.5–7 The conversion of optical energy into electrical energy in photodetectors has surged their applications in image sensing, optical communications, surveillance cameras and biological sensing.8–10 The OHP configuration and properties are tuned to meet the demands of photodetector applications. The bandgap tunability of OHPs makes them suitable for the fabrication of both broadband and narrowband photodetectors. The narrow band gap OHPs such as MAPbI3 and FA0.85Cs0.15PbI3 are implemented in broadband photodetectors and utilized in image sensors and optical communications.11,12 In contrast, the wide bandgap OHPs such as MAPbBr3, MAPbCl3, CH3NH3PbI2Br, and CH3NH3PbIBr2 are employed in narrowband photodetectors, which are useful in spectral/colour discrimination, security systems and artificial vision.13,14 Importantly, OHPs enable the realization of optically transparent and mechanically flexible photodetectors, which is crucial for the next-generation wearable and portable optoelectronic devices.15 Optically transparent photodetectors enable the integration of photodetectors in any device or surface for monitoring light without affecting its aesthetic view.16 Mechanical flexibility facilitates curved surface adaptability as well as lightweight compatibility and unfolds novel applications, including electronic eye and biomedical devices, which are not feasible with Si-based rigid photodetectors.17
Incorporating transparency and flexibility in OHP-based photodetectors along with the realization of a high photoresponse, however, remains a significant challenge due to the divergent nature of the required properties. Recently, Deng et al. fabricated a semi-transparent MAPbI3 nanowire network-based photodetector and demonstrated a moderate photoresponse of 0.1 A W−1 with a limited transparency of ∼30%.18 On the other hand, photodetectors based on a 2D perovskite [(C4H9NH3)2PbBr4] and inorganic perovskite (CsPbCl3) demonstrated high transparency (75–90%); nevertheless, the photoresponse is confined to the UV region (300 nm–410 nm).19–21 Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop novel photodetectors by overcoming the traditional trade-off between transparency and photoresponse in the visible region. The micro/nano-scale patterning of OHPs can not only render high sensitivity and low power consumption but also ascertain transparency and flexibility in photodetectors.22,23 However, the micro/nano-scale patterning of OHPs is constrained due to their sensitivity to polar solvents and high-temperature environments.24,25 The multiple steps involved in the pattering of OHPs lead to phase transformations and degradation of photoluminescence.24,25 Thus, there is a need to develop a simple and solution-free method for the patterning of OHPs without affecting their optoelectronic properties and realize transparent, flexible, and high-performance photodetectors.
In spite of attaining remarkable optoelectronic properties with OHPs, it is challenging to retain them for more than a few hours due to environmental stability issues.26 The surface passivation of OHPs with fluorinated small molecules has been proven to be an effective approach to improve environmental stability.27 Ideally, the surface passivation layer should be compact and hydrophobic to repel water or moisture in air and must be optically transparent simultaneously, so that the incident light reaches underneath OHPs. Both these issues can be addressed by designing a unique supramolecular self-assembly, which has been unexplored for this purpose to date. It is a common practice in supramolecular chemistry to optimize the aliphatic chain length and incorporate fluorinated molecules as well as aromaticity to realize optimal hydrophobicity.28 At the same time, one needs to balance between the length of the aliphatic chains and the aromatic moieties to obtain the requisite transparency.29,30 These comprehensions indicate the need for the development of unique supramolecular self-assemblies for improving the environmental stability of OHPs.
Herein, we have demonstrated single-step stencil lithography using a sequential vacuum sublimation process, which enables the fabrication of ultra-long MAPbI3 perovskite microwire (MW) arrays. The environmental stability of the MAPbI3 perovskite is addressed by cladding with a newly synthesized transparent and ultra-hydrophobic molecular chiral assembly based on a mixture of tripodal L-Phe-C11H23/C7F15 molecules. The resultant photodetector exhibited an excellent transparency of ∼89% and high-performance photodetection with a photo-switching ratio of ∼104, responsivity of 789 A W−1, detectivity of 1014 Jones, and linear dynamic range of ∼122 dB. Furthermore, the ultra-long MAPbI3 perovskite MW arrays enabled mechanical flexibility and ensured remarkable mechanical robustness. The environmental stability of the photodetector passivated with the supramolecular self-assembly based on the mixture of tripodal L-Phe-C11H23/C7F15 molecules demonstrated a stable photoresponse for at least 45 days in an ambient atmosphere.
Results and discussion
Sequential vacuum sublimation is a promising process for producing highly crystalline and superior-quality perovskite thin films over a large area.31 In this study, we have employed a simple and single-step stencil lithography process based on sequential vacuum sublimation, as demonstrated in Fig. 1. Initially, the metal stencil was conformally attached to the desired substrate (Fig. 1a). The substrate along with the metal stencil is loaded inside a vacuum chamber with a pressure of 2 × 106 mbar. The precursor materials lead iodide (PbI2) and methylammonium iodide (MAI) were sequentially sublimed, as shown in Fig. 1b and c, respectively (see experimental section for more details). Consequently, the metal stencil is detached from the substrate and annealed at 110 °C for 30 minutes in an inert atmosphere to obtain MAPbI3 MW arrays (see Fig. 1d and e). Importantly, the patterning process is completed in vacuum before the formation of MAPbI3 and validated high purity and defect-free edges. Stencil lithography is a completely solvent-free method as compared to conventional photolithography and e-beam lithography. Therefore, stencil lithography is a novel method for the scalable patterning of (MAPbI3) perovskites while being simple, rapid and uniform. In order to prevent the environmental degradation of the MAPbI3 MW arrays, a mixture of tripodal L-Phe-C11H23/C7F15 molecules is designed and synthesized, as described in the Experimental section of ESI† (Fig. 1g). The structural backbones of both the molecules were energy minimized using Gaussian DFT calculations, as illustrated in Fig. 1h. In the final step of device fabrication, the tripodal L-Phe-C11H23/C7F15 molecules (20% doping of tripodal L-Phe-C7F15 in tripodal L-Phe-C11H23) were spin-coated over the MAPbI3 MW array as a passivation layer (Fig. 1f) to form a unique supramolecular self-assembly, which was confirmed by UV-Vis spectroscopy (Fig. S1 in the ESI†).

To investigate the phase and crystallinity of the MAPbI3 MW array, we performed X-ray diffraction (XRD) for the as-prepared samples. The XRD peaks (Fig. 2a) demonstrate the existence of a tetragonal MAPbI3 perovskite structure with dominant reflections from the (110) and (220) planes.32,33 For sequential vacuum sublimation, the optimized molar ratio of the initial precursors MAI and PbI2 was 1:0.14, which resulted in a crystalline MAPbI3 phase without leaving any trace of the initial precursors (Fig. S2 in the ESI†). Thus, the sequential vacuum sublimation process is more suitable and tenable as we can easily arrive at our desired crystalline phase by changing the molar ratio of the initial precursors. The optical microscopy image shown in Fig. 2b demonstrates the aligned and uniform growth of the MAPbI3 perovskite MW array containing sharp boundaries at each microstructure. The MAPbI3 MW array comprises microwires of ∼13 μm width and ∼138 μm interval, which are consistent with the dimensions of the metal stencil. Importantly, the MAPbI3 MW array is witnessed throughout the 2 × 2 cm2 area continuously on the glass substrate, endorsing the large-area scalability of stencil lithography (Fig. S3 in the ESI†). Thus, the successful capitalization of stencil lithography is visualized as the uniform patterning of ultra-long MAPbI3 MW arrays over a large area. The conformal contact between the substrate and the metal stencil is crucial to obtain microstructures without any blurring effect and surface migration. The FESEM image (see Fig. 2c and details in ESI Fig. S4†) displays the nanocrystalline nature of the MAPbI3 microstructures and reveals compactness and a high degree of connectivity with a mean particle size of 162 nm, which is attributed to the sequential vacuum sublimation process. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images disclose a thickness of 160 nm with ∼20 nm roughness of the MAPbI3 microstructures (Fig. S5 in the ESI†). On the other hand, the UV-vis absorption spectrum (Fig. 2d) of the MAPbI3 MW array reveals the absorption onset from ∼800 nm that continues throughout the visible region and makes it apposite for broad spectral range photodetectors.34 The band gap estimated from the Tauc plot is found to be 1.50 eV, which is consistent with that previously reported for a pure MAPbI3 perovskite phase35 (Fig. S6 in the ESI,† section 1). The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurements exhibited an emission peak centered at 770 nm with a full width at half maximum of ∼40 nm (Fig. 2d).36 The corresponding PL mapping image (Fig. 2e) displays the uniform intensity of the MAPbI3 MW array owing to the high crystallinity and absence of any defect states. As depicted in Fig. 2f, the optical transparency of the pristine and supramolecular thin-film passivated MAPbI3 MW arrays demonstrates transmittance values of 92% and 89% at 550 nm, respectively. The photograph in the inset of Fig. 2f exhibits high and uniform transmittance of the MAPbI3 MW array passivated with the supramolecular self-assembly. The high transmittance is attributed to a 12% fill factor of the MAPbI3 perovskite, and the supramolecular passivation layer alone (thickness: 40 nm) exhibits a high transparency of ∼98% in a broad spectral range of 400–1000 nm (Fig. S7 in the ESI†). Importantly, the PL spectrum of the MAPbI3 MW array is consistent even after passivating with the supramolecular thin film, which is crucial for its utilization as a passivation layer (Fig. S8 in the ESI†).

The ultra-long MAPbI3 MW array-based photodetection performance is probed using pre-fabricated ITO electrodes containing 20 μm channel length and 2 mm width. The I–V characteristics (Fig. 3a) demonstrated a high photocurrent under the illumination of light with 14.04 mW cm−2 intensity. The photo-switching ratio is defined as (Ilight − Idark)/Idark; it was estimated to be 24691 (∼104 times) at 5 V and was consistent for the four devices (see Fig. S9 in the ESI†), signifying the superior photoresponse of the MAPbI3 MW array.37 The current–voltage characteristics varied significantly under the illumination of different wavelengths of light, i.e., 470, 565 and 660 nm (Fig. 3b). Thus, the photodetector displayed excellent wavelength selectivity throughout the entire visible region. Fig. 3c reveals the I–V characteristics of the MAPbI3 MW array as a function of white light intensities from 0.05 to 14.04 mW cm−2. The photocurrent gradually improved with the increase in light intensities as compared to the dark current, which is the typical characteristic of a photodetector. Linear dynamic range (LDR) is an important performance parameter of a photodetector, which determines the range of incident light intensities with linear responses.38 As displayed in Fig. 3d, the MAPbI3 MW array's photocurrent density discloses a linear response over a wide range of light intensities from 10.2 nW cm−2 to 14.04 mW cm−2, which is almost six (6) decades of light intensity (ESI,† section 2); moreover, the photocurrent does not saturate in a broad light intensity range. The estimated LDR value is 122.69 dB, indicating the excellent photoresponse characteristics of the MAPbI3 MW array. This LDR value of the MAPbI3 MW array is high as compared to that of the opaque perovskite-based photodetector owing to an enhanced surface area and high-quality perovskite microstructures fabricated using stencil lithography. The value of LDR governs the application of photodetectors in optical communications, image sensors, and low light surveillance cameras.

In order to explore the performance parameters of the photodetector, a single MAPbI3 microwire device is fabricated on Si/SiO2 substrate with 0.9 μm Au gap electrodes, as illustrated in the FESEM image in Fig. 4a. The performance parameters of the photodetector, such as spectral responsivity, detectivity, EQE, and noise equivalent power (NEP), were examined and demonstrated in Fig. 4b–d, respectively (ESI,† section 3 to 6).39–41 Spectral responsivity divulges the number of charge carriers generated per unit incident light and is expressed as follows: Rλ = Jph/Plight (ESI,† section 3).40 The photodetector demonstrated a substantial photoresponse in the entire visible region from 400 to 800 nm and the responsivity varied from 10 to 789 A W−1 with a peak value of ∼789 A W−1 at 630 nm (Fig. 4b). The remarkably high responsivity is attributed to vacuum sublimation, where the microstructures of the MAPbI3 perovskite were fabricated in vacuum with high purity and devoid of edge defects.42 Photoresponsivity and transmittance are complementary properties; however, for the first time, the MAPbI3 perovskite MW array demonstrated both properties together in the same device. Notably, the actual active area of the MAPbI3 microwire array is limited to 12% of the total area of the photodetector. The increase in the actual active area leads to an increase in the photoresponse of the photodetector at the cost of transmittance. Therefore, the cross-sectional area and thickness of the MAPbI3 microwire array are crucial to maximize the photoresponse of the transparent photodetector. The optimized thickness of the perovskite MW array is found to be 160 nm, which enabled efficient light absorption and maximized the photoresponse. In contrast, the perovskite MW array with a lower thickness of 90 nm reduced the responsivity of the photodetector by 10 times. Stencil lithography enables the fabrication of microstructures with higher thickness and validates a novel approach to realize a high photoresponse and transmittance together in the same photodetector. The significance of dark current (2.02 × 10−11 A) is analyzed by quantifying detectivity, which is defined as D = Rλ/(2qJd)1/2; the estimated value is ∼1014 Jones at 630 nm (Fig. 4b) (ESI,† section 4).43 As a consequence, the external quantum efficiency (ESI,† section 5), which is defined as EQE = (hcRλ)/eλ, reached a maximum value of ∼105% at 595 nm (Fig. 4c).40 The observed EQE value of the perovskite MW array is much higher than 100%, which is attributed to the photomultiplication phenomenon.44–46 Usually, the EQE values are directly proportional to the extraction of carriers under light illumination and are inversely proportional to the photon excited carrier injection to the trap states.47 As depicted in Fig. 4c, the EQE values are relatively low at lower wavelengths as compared to those at higher wavelengths. At lower wavelengths, light illumination (400 nm) as the photon energy is high, leading to excited carrier injection to the trap states. However, at higher wavelength illumination, as the incident energy is less, the trap state excited carrier injection is reduced, resulting in high EQE values. This phenomenon is also observed in perovskite-based photodetectors47 as well as in Si-based photodetectors.48 Noise equivalent power (NEP) is one of the key parameters to scrutinize the sensitivity of a photodetector. It determines the illuminated power at which the response is equal to the RMS dark noise spectral density, (ESI,† section 6).49 The RMS dark noise spectral density (ESI†) estimated by averaging the dark current over 0.5 s within a specified bandwidth (1 Hz) is found to be ∼723.57 pA Hz−0.5. The corresponding NEP = SI/Rλ as a function of wavelengths from 400 to 800 nm is displayed in Fig. 4d. The NEP value is estimated to be 0.9–68 pW Hz−0.5, which demonstrated the high sensitivity of the photodetector under visible light illumination.

Stable and fast photo-switching is another crucial prerequisite parameter of a photodetector to realize practical applications in optical communication systems. To investigate the switching speed of the ultra-long MW array, modulated light between ON and OFF states with frequency starting from 10 Hz to 8 kHz is illuminated on the photodetector. The transient photocurrent response is recorded and depicted in Fig. 5a for the frequencies of 20, 50, 100, 500 and 800 Hz. For each distinct frequency, the photocurrent is switched between low and high values as the light is modulated between OFF and ON states, respectively. Our photodetector exhibited an excellent frequency response, and the photocurrent cycles briskly elevated with the increase in frequency for a definite time interval. The photoresponse is measured for 800 ON and OFF cycles at 500 Hz frequency (Fig. S10 in the ESI†), which confirmed the consistency of photo-switching. To estimate the response time of the photodetector, we chose photocurrent characteristics at 20 Hz frequency, where the photocurrent reached saturation in both ON and OFF states (see Fig. 5b, ESI,† section 7).50 The rise and fall times evaluated by fitting exponential equations and values were found to be 432 μs and 556 μs, respectively. The fast photoresponse suggested the effective extraction and fast transfer of photo-carriers, which could be ascribed to the perfectly aligned microstructures with minimal cross junctions. The normalized photoresponse as a function of modulated light frequency from 10 Hz to 8 kHz, shown in Fig. 5c, demonstrated a gradual decrease in the photoresponse with frequency. The cut-off frequency (f−3dB) is defined as the frequency at which the photoresponse reduces to half of its original value, and f−3dB is estimated to be 1.8 kHz.40 The cut-off frequency is high as compared to that for conventional and opaque perovskite photodetectors. After comparing all the figures of merit for transparent perovskite photodetectors, it is concluded that our photodetector exhibited superior performance by overcoming the trade-off between transparency and photoresponse (see Table 1). The performance parameters of the MAPbI3 microwire array-based photodetector were very high as compared to those of the opaque perovskite micro/nanostructure-based photodetectors (ESI, Table S1†). The performance is attributed to the orderly aligned and highly crystalline MAPbI3 MW arrays fabricated using simple and single-step stencil lithography, which resulted in enhanced light interaction, efficient photo-carrier generation and transport through pin-hole-free compact microstructures.

A mechanically flexible photodetector provides an edge over rigid devices because of its lightweight compatibility and adaptability to curved surfaces, which can instigate the fabrication of wearable devices. The ultra-long MAPbI3 MW array fabrication is successfully employed on a flexible PET substrate. The photocurrent measurements are recorded while the device is bent with the bending curvatures of 10 mm, 8 mm, and 6 mm, as exemplified in the inset of Fig. 6a. Both photocurrent and dark current were nearly consistent in spite of various bending curvatures, as demonstrated in Fig. 6a. Nominal reduction in the current after restoring to a flat position is due to the generated mechanical strain in the active material. Fig. 6b demonstrates the photocurrent ON and OFF switching cycle flat position and continuous bending configurations of 10 mm, 8 mm, and 6 mm radii. The photodetector displayed excellent light sensitivity and repeatability in all bending configurations. Now, to explore the effect of numerous bending cycles, the device is flexed with a bending radius of 6 mm for 1200 bending cycles, and the photocurrent is measured after every 200 bending cycles. The photocurrent and dark current as a function of consecutive bending cycles are plotted in Fig. 6c. The plots exhibit steady-state currents even after 1200 bending cycles, signifying the mechanical stability of the device. Thus, our photodetector exhibits excellent mechanical robustness, as evident from the rigorous arching experiments.

The environmental stability of the MAPbI3 perovskites is one of the main hurdles for their practical applications despite their remarkable optoelectronic properties. Water and oxygen molecules present under an ambient atmosphere expedite the phase segregation of the MAPbI3 perovskite, leading to the degradation of its optoelectronic properties. Therefore, it is highly desirable to passivate the MAPbI3 perovskite from an ambient atmosphere without influencing its optoelectronic properties. To circumvent these obstacles, chiral, tripodal L-Phe-C11H23/C7F15 molecules were designed and synthesized, which enabled the formation of a unique supramolecular self-assembly (see Fig. 1g) consisting of nano-fibrous networks with a root mean square (RMS) roughness of ∼4 nm (see Fig. 7a). The intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions among the amide bonds, π-stacking interactions contributed by the phenylalanine and chiral, tripodal moieties and van der Waals interactions among the aliphatic long chains were primarily responsible for the unique supramolecular organization of tripodal L-Phe-C11H23, leading to the formation of the nano-fibrous network.58 To examine the water-repelling properties of the self-assembly, contact angle measurements are recorded, as illustrated in Fig. 7b. The contact angle between a water droplet and the supramolecular self-assembly coated over the MAPbI3 MW array is found to be ∼105°, which revealed its ultra-hydrophobic nature. Here, 20% doping of tripodal L-Phe-C7F15 in tripodal L-Phe-C11H23 is employed to achieve optimal transparency and hydrophobicity (ESI, Table S2†). It was envisaged that the tripodal L-Phe-C11H23/C7F15 molecules might provide an optimal balance among the aromatic, aliphatic, and fluorous long chains, which resulted in the ultra-hydrophobic nature and ensured the essential transparency required for the device. To investigate the environmental stability, the X-ray diffraction patterns of the pristine and supramolecular passivated MAPbI3 MW arrays are measured under ambient conditions over a period of 45 days (Fig. 7c and d). In the case of pristine MAPbI3 MW arrays, the perovskite phase diffraction peaks diminished within five days and several intermediate non-perovskite peaks (MAI/PbI2) appeared to increase for 15 days (Fig. 7c). However, the MAPbI3 MW array passivated with the above-mentioned supramolecular self-assembly retained the peaks related to the MAPbI3 perovskite phase even after exposure for 45 days to the ambient atmosphere (Fig. 7d). Furthermore, to examine the environmental stability of the device, photocurrent measurements were recorded for the MAPbI3 MW array passivated with the supramolecular self-assembly under dark and light illumination in an ambient atmosphere for 45 days. As presented in Fig. 7e, the photocurrent and dark current display almost steady-state behavior for over 400 seconds, indicating the light soaking stability of the devices. A similar steady-state photocurrent is observed for successive five days over a period of 45 days, which signified the environmental stability of the MAPbI3 perovskite. Therefore, the supramolecular self-assembly auspiciously serves as a passivation layer, preventing the MAPbI3 MW array from the ambient atmosphere. The supramolecular self-assembly not only deter the interaction with moisture but also prevent the exposure to oxygen, which indicates the strong molecular interactions of the self-assembly and led to the formation of a viscous organogel. These results emphasize the potential of the supramolecular self-assembly as a passivation layer for optoelectronic devices to enhance environmental stability.

Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully developed a single-step stencil lithography for the fabrication of ultra-long MAPbI3 perovskite MW arrays using a sequential vacuum sublimation process. The stencil lithography enabled the fabrication of high-quality and defect-free ultra-long MAPbI3 perovskite MW arrays over a large area of 2 × 2 cm2. The environmental stability of the MAPbI3 perovskite is addressed using a newly designed and synthesized tripodal-L-Phe-C11H23/C7F15-based supramolecular self-assembly as a passivation layer. The MAPbI3 perovskite MW array passivated with the supramolecular self-assembly imposed an excellent transparency of ∼89% at 550 nm for the first time to the best of our knowledge. The resulting photodetector demonstrated superior performance with a switching on/off ratio of 104, responsivity of 789 A W−1, detectivity of ∼1014, and ultra-fast response time of 432 μs. The photodetector also exhibited remarkable mechanical flexibility during 1200 bending cycles at 6 mm bending radius. To the best of our knowledge, the figures of merits of the present photodetector are the best reported values among all transparent perovskite-based photodetectors and are relatively high as compared to those of opaque perovskite-based photodetectors. The vacuum sublimation-based stencil lithography process enabled highly crystalline MAPbI3 perovskite microstructures with an enhanced surface area and efficient photo-carrier generation and transport of carriers to realize high-performance photodetectors. Furthermore, we have established the water repellent properties of the supramolecular self-assembly by demonstrating the obtuse contact angle of 105°. The MAPbI3 perovskite MW array passivated with the supramolecular self-assembly displayed superior light soaking stability and environmental stability over 45 days in ambient atmosphere. The synergy between the fluorinated supramolecular self-assembly and the MAPbI3 perovskite MW array is crucial to achieve enhanced environmental stability. Hence, the stencil lithography for micro-patterning and supramolecular passivation approaches can be extended to other organic and inorganic perovskites to accomplish high-performance optoelectronic devices.
