Herein, Cu12Sb4S13 quantum dots (QDs) are applied as inorganic HTMs in n–i–p planar PSCs, the bandgap aligned the QDs is achieved by the modulation of the QD size to accelerate hole transport from the perovskite layer to QDs, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.13% is achieved for 5.7 nm sized QDs.

The excellent hole transport behavior of Cu12Sb4S13 QDs proves that Cu12Sb4S13 QDs may be considered as an efficient and potential candidate of HTMs in PSCs. Moreover, the stability of the Cu12Sb4S13 QD based PSCs is significantly improved compared with that of the spiro-OMeTAD based one due to the high stability of Cu12Sb4S13 QDs and 91% of the initial PCE is retained after 30 days in ambient air.Yueli LiuYueli Liu is a professor in the State Key Laboratory of Silicate Materials for Architectures and School of Material Science and Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology (WUT).

Introduction
Energy and the environment are facing a huge crisis, and a great number of research studies on photocatalysts and solar cells have been carried out to solve the problems.1–4 Since 2009, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted tremendous attention from researchers, which leads to the rapid increase of the photoelectric conversion efficiency from 3.8% to 23.2%.5–10 Hole transport materials (HTMs) play a significant role in achieving high efficiency in PSCs. So far, the widely used organic HTMs are small-molecule and polymer ones, such as spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene), PTAA (poly-[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine]), etc. In particular, the most popular and traditional HTM is spiro-OMeTAD due to its high solubility in organic solvents, which makes it an ideal material for spin-coating with remarkable efficiency for use in PSCs.11,12 However, the above organic HTM is extremely expensive and has unsatisfactory long-term stability and carrier mobility. Some efforts have been made to improve the hole conductivity of spiro-OMeTAD by doping with LiTFSI and tBP.13 However, the dopants in organic HTMs are hydrophilic and may deteriorate the perovskite layer, which further induces poor long-term stability.14,15
To solve the above problems of organic HTMs, a number of inorganic HTMs have emerged to improve the chemical stability and charge mobility. As reported previously, CuI,16 CuSCN17,18 and NiO19 have been commonly used in PSCs with excellent long-term stability. Nevertheless, the photovoltaic efficiency of PSCs based on inorganic HTMs is still lower than that of PSCs based on organic HTMs. Therefore, it is necessary to explore novel inorganic HTMs to further promote the photovoltaic efficiency.
As typical inorganic HTMs, quantum dots (QDs) are potential materials to meet the requirements of low cost, splendid charge mobility and chemical stability simultaneously. Based on the above characteristic properties, QD materials have been widely used in the fields of solar cells and photodetectors.20–22 It is well known that QDs possess a lot of unique and distinctive advantages as HTMs in PSCs, such as tunable bandgap, hot electron transfer, high absorption coefficient, multiple exciton generation, etc.23–26 Li et al. have reported PbS QDs as HTMs, achieving a PCE of ∼8%.27 Lv et al. have applied colloidal CuInS2 QDs as inorganic HTMs in PSCs, leading to a PCE of 8.38%.28 Later on, Khanzada et al. have introduced an effective engineering of surface ligands for Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) QDs, and it is found that CZTS QDs with removed ligands exhibit excellent hole transporting properties as HTMs in PSCs.29 Till now, the emergence of new QDs as HTMs in PSCs is a current research hotspot. As typical p-type direct bandgap semiconductors, Cu12Sb4S13 QDs have two non-occupied states in the valence band, which induces their quite excellent hole mobility, and the appropriate position of their valence band matches well with that of the perovskite layer. On account of these advantages, Cu12Sb4S13 QDs will be recognized as extraordinary HTMs in PSCs.30–32 Recently, Tamilselvan et al. have used copper antimony sulfide (CAS, Cu12Sb4S13) tetrahedrite nanoparticles as inorganic HTMs in PSCs and obtained a PCE of 6.5%.33 However, the low photovoltaic efficiency with a low VOC value of 0.8 V may originate from the poor charge separation efficiency due to the band energy level of the used CAS HTMs in the PSCs. Therefore, the bandgap alignment of Cu12Sb4S13 QDs should be considered to favor charge transfer to further improve the photovoltaic efficiency of PSCs.
In the present work, we introduce Cu12Sb4S13 QDs as efficient HTMs in n–i–p planar PSCs. To modulate the charge transfer as well as the photovoltaic efficiency of QDs in PSCs, bandgap alignment is proposed by adjusting the QD size. Finally, the photovoltaic efficiency and stability of Cu12Sb4S13 QD based PSCs are effectively improved. This work may provide potential and efficient HTMs for PSCs.
Results and discussion
In this work, various sized Cu12Sb4S13 QDs have been synthesized by controlling the reaction temperature (110 °C, 130 °C and 150 °C) using a simple hot-injection method. The corresponding crystal structures are confirmed by the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 1a, which suggest the cubic structure of the Cu12Sb4S13 phase (JCPDS no. 42-0561). High-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) images show the microstructures of QDs (Fig. 1b–d). They demonstrate that the as-prepared Cu12Sb4S13 QDs are single crystals and monodisperse, and the sizes of QDs increase with the increase of the reaction temperature. The average diameters of QDs at the reaction temperatures of 110 °C, 130 °C and 150 °C are measured to be 4.5 nm, 5.7 nm and 7.9 nm, respectively.

Fig. 2a displays the UV-vis absorption spectra of Cu12Sb4S13 QDs with different sizes, and we can conclude that the absorption band of QDs is red-shifted from 650 nm to 750 nm when the sizes change from 4.5 nm to 7.9 nm. As shown in Fig. 2b, the bandgap of QDs decreases with the increase of the sizes, and the corresponding bandgaps fitted with Tauc plots are determined to be 1.95 eV, 1.84 eV and 1.80 eV, respectively, which are in good agreement with the quantum confinement effects.30

The scheme of the PSC with the structure FTO/c-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/Cu12Sb4S13/Au is shown in Fig. 3a, and Cu12Sb4S13 QDs are used as HTMs to substitute the traditional spiro-OMeTAD. The cross-sectional FESEM image of Cu12Sb4S13 QD based PSCs is shown in Fig. 3b, and that of the spiro-OMeTAD based PSCs is also shown in Fig. S1.† However, the layers of QDs and TiO2 are rather thin and it is difficult to exactly distinguish them from the cross-sectional FESEM image. The formations of QDs and TiO2 can be verified by the continuous change of the morphology and roughness, as proved by the top-view FESEM images shown in Fig. S2.† In particular, in Fig. S2d,† extremely thin and uniform dispersion of the QDs on the surface of the perovskite layer can be found, preventing direct contact between Au electrodes and the perovskite layer. From Fig. 3c, we can observe that the perovskite crystals are large and closely packed without apparent pinholes, which suggests the reduced possibility of charge recombination.

For the purpose of designing a compact hole transport film with high quality, a series of experiments are carried out to optimize QD films with a size of 5.7 nm, including the concentration of the QD solution and the thickness of the deposited QD layer. The J–V curves of the corresponding PSCs are illustrated in Fig. S3† and the detailed parameters are listed in Table S1.† To conclude, in our case the optimal conditions are single layer and a suitable concentration of 10 mg mL−1. Based on the optimal conditions of QD films, the thickness of the resulting QD film is approximately 10 nm as shown in Fig. S2d.† As the QD film is very thin, it may reduce the series resistance of the PSCs.
The photovoltaic performances of PSCs with the various sized Cu12Sb4S13 QDs as HTMs are compared with that of the spiro-OMeTAD based one as shown in Fig. 4a, and the detailed parameters are listed in Table 1. This shows that the PSCs using 5.7 nm sized QDs achieve the best PCE of 14.13% with a VOC of 1.05 V, a JSC of 21.85 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 61.60%, respectively, which is competitive with the PCE of the PSCs using spiro-OMeTAD (15.25%). Interestingly, the PCE in our case is higher than or comparable with those of the PSCs using QDs as HTMs, such as PbS (∼8%),27 CuInS2 (8.38%),28 CZTS (15.4%)29 and Cu12Sb4S13 nanoparticles (6.5%).33 Moreover, the Cu12Sb4S13 QD based PSCs possess a higher JSC compared with that of the PSCs using spiro-OMeTAD, which is further verified by the IPCE measurements in Fig. 4b. It is obvious that the IPCE value of Cu12Sb4S13 QD based PSCs with a size of 5.7 nm is slightly higher than that of the spiro-OMeTAD based one in the wavelength region of 300–670 nm. The integrated JSC values from IPCE spectra in Fig. 4b are 21.70 mA cm−2 and 20.67 mA cm−2 for the PSCs using 5.7 nm QDs and spiro-OMeTAD as HTMs, respectively, which are well-matched with the results of J–V measurements in Fig. 4a. From the UV-vis absorption spectra in Fig. 4c, it is found that the light absorption intensity of the QD based PSCs is slightly higher than that of the spiro-OMeTAD based one in the wavelength range of 300–800 nm. The result implies that the QD layer as the HTM not only performs the function of hole transport but also may favor light absorption in PSCs due to the high light absorption coefficient of Cu12Sb4S13 QDs (4 × 105 cm−1). Therefore, the extra light absorption behavior by using the QDs as HTMs enables the generation of more photo-induced electrons and holes and then induces the increase of JSC.

To investigate the stability of PSCs using Cu12Sb4S13 QDs or spiro-OMeTAD as HTMs, the photovoltaic performances of 20 sealed PSCs stored in ambient air are measured every 2–3 days for 30 days, and the average PCE values are obtained. The normalized PCE over time is shown in Fig. 4d. The PSCs using 5.7 nm sized Cu12Sb4S13 QDs as HTMs retain 91% of the initial PCE after 30 days, corresponding to a PCE of 12.86%. In contrast, the PCE of the PSCs using spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM shows an obvious drop of 39% after 30 days, which indicates that the PSCs using 5.7 nm sized Cu12Sb4S13 QDs as HTMs show an enhanced stability compared to that of the spiro-OMeTAD based PSCs.
To achieve the band alignment of various sized QDs and better comprehend the hole extraction and transport between the perovskite and HTMs, Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS) is carried out to exactly investigate the energy levels of various sized Cu12Sb4S13 QDs, as shown in Fig. 5. As the intercept for the secondary electron onset is 16.35 eV and the He energy is 21.20 eV, we can calculate that the Fermi energy (EF) position relative to the vacuum level for 4.5 nm sized Cu12Sb4S13 QDs is −4.85 eV as shown in Fig. 5a, b. The difference between the EF and the valence band maximum (EVBM) for Cu12Sb4S13 QDs is further determined to be 0.60 eV by linear extrapolation of the low binding energy region near the Fermi edge, which indicates a valance band (VB) value of −5.45 eV for 4.5 nm sized QDs (inset in Fig. 5a). Combined with the bandgap result in Fig. 2b, the conduction band (CB) is calculated to be −3.50 eV. Likewise, the energy band structure of QDs of 5.7 nm and 7.9 nm can be determined in Fig. 5c–f, and the detailed calculated UPS results are listed in Table 2. The bandgap alignment of different sized Cu12Sb4S13 QDs in PSCs is illustrated in Fig. 6. It is obvious that with the increase of the size, the VB and CB positions of Cu12Sb4S13 QDs shift upward and downward, respectively, which is consistent with the quantum confinement effects.30

 Fig. 6  The diagram of the energy levels for the PSCs with various HTMs. 
It is found that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of spiro-OMeTAD (−5.1 eV) is higher than that of the perovskite, which is favorable for hole transport from the perovskite layer to the spiro-OMeTAD layer. However, the valence band offset between spiro-OMeTAD and perovskite leads to a low hole transport rate and high voltage loss. Therefore, Cu12Sb4S13 QDs of 5.7 nm and 7.9 nm possess shallower HOMO levels and deeper HOMO levels than those of the perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD, respectively, which may facilitate hole transport from the perovskite layer to the HTM layer and reduce the carrier recombination at the interface between the perovskite and the HTM. At the same time, the HOMO level of 4.5 nm sized Cu12Sb4S13 QDs is too deep to favor for hole transport.
Due to the superb hole mobility of Cu12Sb4S13 QDs, their ability to extract holes from the perovskite layer is quite effective, which is proven using steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra. As illustrated in Fig. 7a, 7.9 nm Cu12Sb4S13 QD based PSCs have better carrier extraction ability than the spiro-OMeTAD based one; in contrast, 4.5 nm Cu12Sb4S13 QD based PSCs possess the poorest carrier extraction ability as their PL peak intensity is the strongest one, reflecting serious carrier recombination in the luminescence process. Interestingly, the 5.7 nm Cu12Sb4S13 QD based PSCs exhibit the best PL quenching behavior, indicating the markedly enhanced ability to extract holes from the perovskite layer. In our case, the above results mean that the low carrier recombination may significantly influence the photovoltaic efficiency of the PSCs as shown in Fig. 4a, as the 5.7 nm sized Cu12Sb4S13 QDs have a proper VB position with respect to that of the perovskite layer.
 Fig. 7  (a) Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra. (b) EIS curves and (c) transient absorption spectra of the PSCs with various HTMs. 
In addition, the hole transport capability of the PSCs is further validated using EIS measurements. Fig. 7b presents the Nyquist plots of the PSCs in the frequency range from 1 Hz to 1 MHz under a variable reverse potential from 0.5 V to 1.0 V in a dark environment. Moreover, AC 20 mV perturbation is applied from 1 Hz to 1 MHz. The equivalent circuit consists of a series resistance (Rs), a charge transfer resistance (Rct) and a constant phase element (CPE) as shown in the inset in Fig. 7b. The CPE is a non-ideal capacitor, typically including CPE-T and CPE-P, which are related to the interface capacitor and an ideal capacitor, respectively. The fitted parameters of EIS curves are summarized in Table 3. The fitted Rs values of Cu12Sb4S13 QD based PSCs with various sizes are 11.34 Ω, 24.58 Ω and 24.39 Ω, respectively, which are much larger than those of the spiro-OMeTAD based one (0.63 Ω). In addition, the 4.5 nm QD based PSCs show the largest Rct value of 8403 Ω. Nevertheless, the fitted Rct values of 5.7 nm (4908 Ω) and 7.9 nm (5717 Ω) for QD based PSCs are smaller than those of the spiro-OMeTAD based one (7356 Ω). As Rct is a reflection of carrier recombination during the carrier transport of PSCs, a small Rct suggests a well-combined interface between perovskite and carrier transport layers. That is to say, the 5.7 nm QD based PSCs possess the highest hole transport ability to reduce the carrier recombination rate, leading to the improvement of the PSC performance, which is consistent with the results of steady-state PL in Fig. 7a and the energy band alignment in Fig. 6.

Furthermore, femtosecond laser transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) is carried out to study the carrier kinetics in perovskite/HTM films under 520 nm light excitation, as shown in Fig. 7c. The time profiles of the transient absorption at a wavelength of 751 nm for perovskite/HTMs are well-fitted by a single-exponential function  and their lifetimes are summarized in Table 4. In detail, the time constants of the perovskite/HTMs with the various sized QDs and spiro-OMeTAD are calculated to be 44.29 ns, 21.45 ns, 39.76 ns and 41.40 ns, respectively. The transient absorption (TA) decays of perovskite/HTMs with 5.7 nm QDs are much faster than those of the others, which suggests that the electrons and holes generated in the perovskite film are effectively extracted and the holes in the perovskite layer are enabled to be effectively transported to HTMs, as 5.7 nm sized Cu12Sb4S13 QDs possess a proper valence band position with respect to that of the perovskite film as shown in Fig. 6.

Conclusions
In summary, various sized Cu12Sb4S13 QDs with various sizes are prepared using a simple hot-injection method and successfully applied as efficient HTMs in PSCs. The result reveals that the 5.7 nm sized Cu12Sb4S13 QDs achieve the best photovoltaic efficiency of 14.13%, which is comparable with that of the PSCs using spiro-OMeTAD HTMs. It is worth mentioning that an admirable JSC value of 21.85 mA cm−2 is obtained for the PSCs using 5.7 nm sized Cu12Sb4S13 QDs as HTMs, which is due to the extra light absorption contributions of Cu12Sb4S13 QDs as proven using UV-vis spectra. UPS measurements prove that the energy level of Cu12Sb4S13 QDs can be varied by varying their size, and 5.7 nm sized QDs have the most proper bandgap alignment for the PSCs in our case. In addition, EIS, steady-state PL and TAS measurements provide valid evidence that Cu12Sb4S13 QD based PSCs have more efficient hole injection behavior from the perovskite layer to HTMs, which is favorable for the reduced recombination possibility of the photo-excited electrons and holes, and the result also implies that Cu12Sb4S13 QDs possess superb hole transport properties compared to the traditional spiro-OMeTAD. Furthermore, the stability of the Cu12Sb4S13 QD based PSCs is markedly improved compared with that of the spiro-OMeTAD based one due to the higher stability of inorganic QDs,34 which proves that Cu12Sb4S13 QDs can be efficient HTMs in PSCs.

N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%), 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP, 96%), lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI, 99.95%) and chlorobenzene (C6H5Cl, anhydrous, 99.8%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Acetonitrile (CH3CN, 99.8+%, Argon), lead(II) iodide (PbI2, 99.9985%) and cuprous iodide (CuI, 99%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Spiro-OMeTAD was purchased from LumTec. Diphenyl ether (C12H10O, >99%), oleylamine (OLA, 80–90%), N,N′-diphenylthiourea (C13H12N2S, 98%), antimony trichloride (SbCl3, 99%) and 1-hexanethiol (C6H14S, 96%) were purchased from Aladdin. Hexane, methanol and TiCl4 were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd in China.
Synthesis of Cu12Sb4S13 QDs
A hot-injection method was applied to prepare the Cu12Sb4S13 QDs, and the detailed synthesis process was described in our previous work.31,32,35 The product was purified by a precipitation/dispersion cycle: the mother liquor (1 mL) was added into methanol (3 mL) and the precipitates were separated by centrifuging at 8000 rpm for 3 min. Hexane (5 mL) was used to re-disperse the QDs, and the dissolved solution was centrifuged again at 8000 rpm for 3 min to obtain the liquid supernatant for the follow-up work. The product was further purified by a precipitation/dispersion cycle and re-dispersed in hexanethiol before being employed as the precursor solution of HTMs. In our case, it was found that the metal salt could not coordinate well with oleylamine when the reaction temperature was below 110 °C, while the stability of the QD solution became worse when the reaction temperature was higher than 150 °C. Therefore, the reaction temperatures were controlled as 110 °C, 130 °C and 150 °C.
Device fabrication
The etched FTO glasses were cleaned by ultrasound for 15 min with detergent, deionized water and ethanol in sequence. Next, the cleaned FTO glasses were used as substrates to deposit an ultrathin TiO2 film, which was prepared by hydrolysis of 50 mM TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 1 h. After being washed with deionized water, the substrates were annealed on a hotplate at 450 °C for 10 min. The above fabrication process of the TiO2 film was repeated again to deposit a compact TiO2 film. To prepare the perovskite layer, 231.4 mg PbI2 and 80 mg CH3NH3I3 were dissolved in 0.5 mL DMF to form a 1 M perovskite precursor solution and shaken in a spiral mixer for 10 min to form a homogeneous and clear yellow solution. An anti-solvent method was used to prepare a smooth, pinhole-free and high quality perovskite film. The perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated on the TiO2 film at 5000 rpm for 30 s with chlorobenzene as an anti-solvent after plasma pre-treatment for 120 s. Then, the prepared perovskite layer was annealed at 100 °C for 10 min, and the film color turned from yellow to dark. In particular, to obtain a larger perovskite crystal, the traces of Pb(SCN)2 were added into the perovskite precursor solution.36 Thereafter, the QD solution dispersed in hexane was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 3 min again, and the precipitate was redispersed in hexanethiol to form the precursor solution of QDs. Then the precursor solution of QDs was spin-coated onto the perovskite layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s to form an ultrathin QD film. To optimize the thickness of the QD layer, the concentration of the QD solution and the thickness of the deposited QD layer were controlled in the ranges of 5–15 mg mL−1 and 1–3 layers, respectively. The formed QD layer was annealed at 110 °C for 3 min. For comparison, a spiro-OMeTAD precursor solution consisting of 41.6 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 7.81 μL LiTFSI, 16.88 μL tBP and 0.5 mL chlorobenzene was prepared after being shaken for 5 min. Subsequently, the spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin-coated on the perovskite layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, the counter electrode Au was thermally evaporated on HTLs with a thickness of 80 nm. The preparations of the perovskite, QDs and spiro-OMeTAD were conducted in a glovebox filled with high purity argon to prevent the deterioration of the perovskite.
Measurement and characterization
The crystal structures and microstructures of the as-prepared QDs were characterized using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Pert-Pro, PANalytical, Netherlands) and a High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope (HRTEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL, Japan). UV-vis absorption (UV-2550, Shimadzu, Japan) in the wavelength range from 300 nm to 800 nm was recorded to characterize the optical absorption properties of the samples. A Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM, JSEM-5610LV, Hitachi, Japan) was used to observe the morphology of the materials and PSCs. Electrochemical Impedance Spectra (EIS) (Autolab Potentiostat 30, PGSTAT100, Netherlands) and steady-state PL spectra (LabRam HR, HORIBA Jobin Yvon, France) were taken to evaluate the hole mobility of QDs in PSCs, and the films for steady-state PL measurements were deposited on glass substrates and measured from the glass side. Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS, ESCALAB 250Xi, Thermo Fisher, USA) measurements were made using He I radiation (21.2 eV) and the samples were drop-cast on copper sheets.
Besides, the power conversion efficiency was examined using current density–voltage (J–V) measurements to test the photovoltaic performances of the prepared devices. J–V curves were obtained with a voltage setting from −1.5 V to 0.5 V using a Keithley Model 2430 under AM 1.5G simulated irradiation with a standard solar simulator (Model 91160-1000, Newport, USA). The light intensity of the solar simulator was calibrated using a light irradiation meter (Model 91150V, Newport, USA). The PSCs were masked with a definite aperture to define an active area of 0.25 cm2. Incident Photo-to-current Conversion Efficiency (IPCE) spectra were collected with a solar simulator (74004-1, 300 W xenon lamp, Newport, USA) coupled with a power meter (Model 2396R, Newport, USA) and an aligned monochromator (Oriel Cornerstone 130 1/8 m, Newport, USA). The photo-generated current was evaluated after calibrating the lamp spectrum with an UV-enhanced Si photodetector (Newport). The femtosecond laser transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS, Spirit 1040-8-SHG, Spectra-Physics, USA) measurements were taken to investigate the carrier transport process at the interfaces between the perovskite film and HTMs.
