    , Accepted 15th February 2022First published on 15th February 2022AbstractWe herein design and synthesize two small organic molecules with hole transport properties, 4,4′-(5,11-dioctyl-5,11-dihydroindolo[3,2-b]carbazole-6,12-diyl)bis(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline) (TM5) and 4,4′-(5,11-dioctyl-5,11-dihydroindolo[3,2-b]carbazole-6,12-diyl)bis(N,N-bis(4-(methylthio)phenyl)aniline) (TM6), as interfacial layers between the perovskite and hole transport layer (HTL) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). There exist coordination interactions and hydrogen bonds between the TM molecules and perovskite, as revealed by X-ray photoelectron and infrared spectroscopy. For this reason, after the perovskite film is coated with the TM5 and TM6 layers, respectively, the defect density is reduced significantly from 2.78 × 1015 to 6.49 × 1014 and 4.99 × 1014 cm−3. In addition, a gradient energy level alignment is formed between the perovskite, interface layer, and HTL. As a consequence, hole extraction is significantly enhanced and charge recombination is notably slowed down. The TM5 and TM6 interfacial layers thus bring about significant enhancements of power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 17.42% to 19.53% and 20.18%, respectively. The TM coatings can also protect perovskite against humidity. The TM5 and TM6 coated PSCs demonstrate good stability after 1056 h aging at a relative humidity of 30–40% with decreases of PCE only by 5% and 3%, respectively, in contrast to the 43% decline of PCE for the control solar cell.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been quickly advanced with the rapid improvement of power conversion efficiency (PCE).1–4 The PCE of the top-notch PSC has already been comparable to that of commercial silicon-based solar cells.5 The rapid development of PSCs benefits from the long carrier diffusion length, excellent light absorption coefficient, and adjustable direct band gap (Eg) of the perovskite material.6 However, a large number of dangling bond defects are formed on the surface and grain boundaries of perovskite particles, due to the soft crystal lattice and low defect formation energy during the crystallization of polycrystalline perovskite films.7 These surface defects that are dominant in the polycrystalline perovskite films7,8 become non-radiative recombination centers and hence diminish the photovoltaic performance of PSCs.9 Moreover, defects can provide channels for water and oxygen invasion, thereby ruining the long-term stability of PSCs.10 Under light illumination, the defects can convert oxygen in air to superoxide (O2−) species, which accelerates the photodegradation of perovskite and thus destroys the photo-stability of PSCs.11–13
The decomposition of the perovskite film mainly starts from the surface and grain boundaries, because there are a lot of defects there.8 To improve the stability of perovskite films, different passivation methods and materials are used to passivate the defects of perovskite films.10,14–18 For comparison, reported passivation materials and the corresponding performance are summarized in Table S1.†
To passivate the surface defects of perovskite films, we herein design and synthesize two novel P-type organic molecules19–22 through the combination of indolocarbazole and triphenylamine: 4,4′-(5,11-dioctyl-5,11-dihydroindolo[3,2-b]carbazole-6,12-diyl)bis(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline) (TM5) and 4,4′-(5,11-dioctyl-5,11-dihydroindolo[3,2-b]carbazole-6,12-diyl)bis(N,N-bis(4-(methylthio)phenyl)aniline) (TM6) to coat onto the perovskite surface. The structures of TM5 and TM6 are shown in Scheme 1. The indolocarbazole has a large π conjugation plane and high electron cloud density, which is beneficial to hole transport and defect passivation.20,23 In addition, as triphenylamine has a suitable ionization potential and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level, the formed TM5 and TM6 molecules based on the combination of triphenylamine with indolocarbazole may possess energy levels well matching those of perovskite.24,25 The difference of TM5 and TM6 is the substituents on the triphenylamine unit; the former has a methoxy group and the latter has a methylthio group. The purpose of using the two substituents is to produce different interactions between TM5 and perovskite as well as between TM6 and perovskite. Different interactions are expected to bring about different passivation effects on perovskite.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic routes of TM5 and TM6. 
In addition, the dopant of Li salt in spiro-OMeTAD, which acts as a hole transport layer (HTL) of PSCs, has strong hygroscopicity, which can destroy the stability of perovskite when the doped spiro-OMeTAD is directly deposited on the perovskite film. To protect the perovskite from moisture, we cover the perovskite film with hydrophobic TM5 and TM6, respectively, which can avoid direct contact between the hygroscopic dopant and the perovskite and thus improve the humid stability.
In this work, the coordination interactions and hydrogen bonds formed between perovskite and TM5 (or TM6) are explored. Also, the effects of TM5 and TM6 coatings on the defect density, interfacial hole extraction, charge recombination, photovoltaic performance, and stability are systematically studied. When TM5 and TM6 are respectively used as the interfacial layer, the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) increases from 1.026 to 1.091 and 1.111 V, the short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) rises from 22.56 to 23.00 and 23.10 mA cm−2, and the fill factor (FF) goes up from 75.23% to 78.03% and 78.62%, resulting in PCE enhancements from 17.42% to 19.53% and 20.18%, respectively. Furthermore, the TM5 and TM6 coatings can well protect the perovskite layer against humidity, owing to their hydrophobic properties and the defect passivation effect, so that the long-term stability can be improved notably.
Experimental section
The synthetic routes of TM5 and TM6 are shown in Scheme 1. Compounds 3, 6 and 9 (Scheme 1) were synthesized according to the previously reported literature.26–28 The spectra and data of 1H NMR and 13C NMR of compounds 3 and 6 are displayed in Fig. S1–S4.† The syntheses of compound 10, TM5 and TM6 are described as follows.

Then 50 cm3 of 50% KOH aqueous solution was added dropwise slowly at room temperature to the above system. The reaction mixture was heated to 80 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere with continuous stirring for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was extracted with dichloromethane (DCM) twice (20 cm3 × 2).

The reaction mixture was heated to 135 °C under stirring for 24 h in a nitrogen atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (EA) twice (20 cm3 × 2). After the combined organic extracts were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, the solvent was removed under vacuum. Residual oil product was purified through column chromatography with EA:PE = 1/20 (v/v), generating 0.51 g of light yellow solid (yield: 61.8%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6) (Fig. S8†): 7.35–7.41 (m, 2H), 7.27 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 2H), 7.12–7.16 (t, J = 8.0 Hz, 6H), 7.04 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 4H), 6.97 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 4H), 6.80–6.91 (m, 10H), 6.64 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 4H), 3.75 (S, 4H), 3.67 (s, 12H), 1.18 (s, 24H), 0.79 (t, J = 8.0 Hz, 6H). 13C NMR (101 MHz, CDCl3) (Fig. S9†): 156.1, 155.7, 148.7, 147.2, 142.6, 141.4, 141.3, 137.5, 136.4, 132.8, 131.3, 130.8, 129.5, 126.8, 126.4, 126.2, 125.3, 123.4, 123.2, 122.8, 122.5, 121.3, 121.1, 121.0, 119.6, 118.8, 117.9, 115.0, 114.8, 111.8, 109.4, 108.4, 77.6, 77.3, 77.0, 55.9, 44.5, 39.7, 32.1, 30.0, 29.7, 29.4, 27.6, 22.9, 14.4.

The reaction mixture was heated to 135 °C under continuous stirring for 24 h in a nitrogen atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was extracted with EA twice (20 cm3 × 2). The combined organic extracts were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. The solvent was removed under vacuum and the residual oil product was purified through column chromatography with EA:PE = 1/20 (v/v), producing 0.58 g of off-white solid (yield: 62.6%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6) (Fig. S11†): 7.37 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 2H), 7.17–7.27 (m, 8H), 7.13 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 8H), 6.98–7.07 (m, 2H), 6.89–6.93 (m, 2H), 6.81–6.85 (m, 10H), 2.48 (s, 4H), 2.39 (s, 12H), 1.18 (s, 24H), 0.79 (t, J = 8.0 Hz, 6H). 13C NMR (101 MHz, CDCl3) (Fig. S12†): 146.0, 145.9, 145.5, 139.0, 138.6, 137.6, 136.2, 132.4, 131.8, 131.7, 129.9, 128.7, 126.2, 125.2, 124.8, 124.0, 123.9, 121.2, 119.5, 119.0, 118.0, 111.7, 109.5, 77.6, 77.2, 76.9, 44.5, 39.8, 32.1, 30.0, 29.7, 29.6, 29.4, 27.6, 27.3, 23.0, 18.1, 17.1, 14.4. ESI-HRMS (Fig. S13†) calculated for C74H78N4S4 (M+): 1150.5109, found: 1150.5499.
The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves of TM5 and TM6 are shown in Fig. S14a,† from which the melting points of TM5 and TM6 are determined to be 212.12 and 197.97 °C, respectively. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves of TM5 and TM6 are shown in Fig. S14b,† from which the decomposition temperatures (Td) of TM5 and TM6 are derived to be 369.97 and 323.84 °C, respectively.
Device fabrication
The device structures adopted in this work are ITO/SnO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au and ITO/SnO2/perovskite/TM5 (or TM6)/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. The fabrication details of perovskite films and PSC devices can be found in the ESI.†29 For the deposition of interfacial layers, the TM5 or TM6 solutions in chlorobenzene were spin-coated on the perovskite layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s.
The fabricated control perovskite film demonstrates a typical perovskite crystal structure, as shown in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. S15†). The TM5- and TM6-coated perovskite films show similar XRD spectra with almost the same peak positions and intensities, indicating that TM5 and TM6 coatings do not affect the crystal structure and crystallinity of the perovskite film. As the TM5 and TM6 organic molecules have the potential to affect the lattice orientation of the surface layer of perovskite, which may influence the interfacial carrier transfer, it is deserved to investigate this issue in the future.
An n–i–p device structure (Fig. S16†) was adopted for the PSCs studied in this work. The SnO2 film acts as an electron transport layer (ETL), the MAPbI3 active layer is the light-absorbing layer, the TM5 (or TM6) thin layer is the interface layer, the spiro-OMeTAD layer is the HTL, and the Au layer is the metal electrode. Fig. S17a and b† display the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the TM5- and TM6-coated PSCs. It can be seen that the thickness of SnO2, perovskite, spiro-OMeTAD and Au is 18, 300, 108 and 90 nm, respectively. However, the thickness of TM5 and TM6 layers is too thin to be detected.
The concentration of TM5 (or TM6) solution was first optimized by comparing the current–voltage (J–V) curves of PSCs based on the TM5- and TM6-coated perovskite films with various concentrations of TM5 (or TM6) solutions for spin-coating. It was found that the highest PCE could be achieved at a concentration of 0.5 mg cm−3 for both TM5 and TM6 (see Fig. S18a and b, Tables S2 and S3 in the ESI†). As a consequence, the best concentration of 0.5 mg cm−3 was adopted to fabricate the corresponding films and PSCs throughout this work.
Results and discussion
Energy levels of TM5 and TM6
Firstly, we test the energy levels of TM5 and TM6, as they determine whether the interfacial carrier transfer can occur. Fig. 1a shows the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of TM5 and TM6 solutions in DCM. The onsets of the first anodic waves are located at +0.27 and +0.30 V for TM5 and TM6, respectively, which are regarded as their HOMO levels. As a control, the recorded CV curve of spiro-OMeTAD under the same conditions is also plotted in Fig. 1a for direct comparison, where the first anodic wave onset is situated at +0.13 V. Considering the HOMO level of −5.22 eV (vacuum level) for spiro-OMeTAD, the HOMO levels of TM5 and TM6 are calculated to be −5.36 and −5.39 eV, respectively.

The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of TM5 and TM6 solutions in DCM are shown in Fig. 1b. The wavelength at the intersection point (λint) between the normalized UV-vis and PL curves is determined to be 426 nm for both molecules, corresponding to a band gap (Eg) of 2.91 eV for both TM5 and TM6. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of TM5 and TM6 are thus calculated to be −2.45 and −2.48 eV, respectively, based on the formula of LUMO = HOMO + Eg.
Based on the above measured energy levels, we draw an energy level diagram displayed in Fig. 1c. As the HOMO levels of TM5 and TM6 are higher than the valence band of perovskite but lower than the HOMO of the HTL (i.e. spiro-OMeTAD), a gradient band structure is formed among the three materials of the perovskite, interface layer (TM5 or TM6), and spiro-OMeTAD HTL (Fig. 1c). Such an energy level gradient is beneficial to enhance hole extraction.19
The Gaussian 09 package with B3LYP/6-31G+(d,p) was used to perform density functional theory (DFT) calculations, from which the surface electrostatic potential (ESP) diagrams for TM5 (Fig. 2a) and TM6 (Fig. 2b) can be obtained.30 The negative charge is concentrated mainly on the O atoms and the entire plane of indolocarbazole for TM5 (Fig. 2a). A similar distribution of negative charge is observed for TM6, in which the negative charge is also partially delocalized to the benzene rings of the triphenylamine unit (Fig. 2b). The main reason for this difference in the charge distribution is likely that the O atom has higher electronegativity than the S atom. The electron-rich O and S atoms and the indolocarbazole unit are predicted to coordinate with the surface Pb2+ ions of unsaturated coordination to passivate the iodide vacancy (VI) or lead iodide anti-site (PbI) defects.7 Moreover, the more electronegative O, N and S atoms may form N–H⋯O, N–H⋯N and/or N–H⋯S hydrogen bonds with the H atoms in the methylamine cation (MA+) so as to prevent the generation of MA vacancies (VMA) and thus improve the performance and long-term stability of PSCs.31 The dipole moments of TM5 and TM6 calculated from DFT are 0.1870 and 2.6419 D, respectively. Since TM6 has a much larger dipole moment than TM5, faster intramolecular charge transportation and higher carrier mobility are anticipated for the former with a methylthio group.32

As hole transport materials, it is necessary to measure the hole mobilities of TM5 and TM6 by means of the space charge limited current method (SCLC). The curves of the square root of current density as a function of bias potential for the devices [structure: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/HTL/MoO3/Ag, where the HTL is TM5, TM6, or spiro-OMeTAD (doped or undoped)] are presented in Fig. S19,† which are fitted according to the Mott–Gurney law (see eqn S1†). The hole mobilities of TM5, TM6 and spiro-OMeTAD are respectively determined to be 3.10 × 10−4, 3.31 × 10−4, and 1.27 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1; each is undoped. For the undoped case, TM5 and TM6 show much higher hole mobility than spiro-OMeTAD. The mobility values of undoped TM5 and undoped TM6 are even comparable to that of doped spiro-OMeTAD (3.41 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). The high hole mobility of TM5 and TM6 is attributed to the large π-conjugated plane of indolocarbazole that is beneficial to the intramolecular charge transport. As the TM6 molecule has a larger dipole moment than the TM5 molecule (Fig. 2), TM6 shows higher mobility than TM5, verifying the previous DFT calculation prediction.
Owing to the high hole mobility values for TM5 and TM6 without any doping, our initial idea is to employ the two new materials as the dopant-free hole transport materials of PSCs. We tried to fabricate PSCs with a device structure of ITO/SnO2/MAPbI3/TM5 (or TM6)/Au, where TM5 or TM6 acts as an HTL whose thickness is 50 nm, as revealed by cross-sectional SEM (Fig. S20†). Fig. S21† displays the J–V curves for the PSCs with the undoped HTLs. The PCEs of 13.74%, 15.29%, and 6.48% are obtained for the PSCs respectively based on TM5, TM6, and spiro-OMeTAD HTLs that are all undoped (Fig. S21, Table S4†). In the undoped case, both TM5 and TM6 are much better than spiro-OMeTAD as the HTL for n–i–p PSCs. By comparison, the TM6 based PSC generates higher PCE than the TM5 based PSC due to the higher hole mobility for the former. We also doped TM5 and TM6 with LiTFSI and TBP like doped spiro-OMeTAD, but the doping is not so effective for TM5 and TM6 as for spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. S22 and Table S4†). The photovoltaic performances of undoped and doped devices with TM5 or TM6 HTLs are similar (Table S4†). This indicates that the dopants of LiTFSI and TBP typically used for spiro-OMeTAD are not suitable for TM5 and TM6 HTLs. In view of the unsatisfactory photovoltaic performance, we did not continue the study on the PSCs with TM5 and TM6 as the HTLs, respectively.
Interactions between the interface layer and perovskite
The electron-rich atoms in TM5 and TM6, such as the N, O and S atoms, may form coordination bonds with the surface Pb2+ ions as well as hydrogen bonds with the hydrogen atoms in MA+. These interactions may induce some positive effects that can enhance the solar cell performance and improve the stability of perovskite as well. We thus employ TM5 and TM6 as the interface layer between the perovskite and the spiro-OMeTAD HTL, with which we hope to improve the solar cell performance and the device stability. Let us first characterize the interactions between the interface layer and perovskite.
Formation of coordination bonds
In general, the 6p empty electron orbital of the Pb2+ ion of unsaturated-coordination in the perovskite has a strong ability to form covalent bonds with Lewis bases. This can be verified by the evolution of the binding energy for the Pb 4f peak in the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum. Fig. S23† shows the XPS spectra of the pristine perovskite and TM5- and TM6-coated perovskite films, respectively. The Pb 4f5/2 and Pb 4f7/2 peaks are respectively located at 143.4 and 138.5 eV for the pristine perovskite film. The above two peaks respectively shift to 143.2 and 138.3 eV for the TM5-coated perovskite, and move to 143.1 and 138.2 eV for the TM6-coated perovskite. The lowering of Pb 4f binding energies upon the insertion of the TM5 and TM6 interface layers between perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD is ascribable to the electron donation from TM5 (or TM6) to Pb2+, which reduces the bondage to electrons. This indicates that coordination bonds are formed between TM5 (or TM6) molecules and perovskite.
It is noted that two small peaks at 141.6 and 136.7 eV, which are assignable to metallic Pb, appear in the spectrum for the pristine perovskite film (Fig. S23†). The metallic Pb is formed due to the reduction of Pb2+ by VI.19 This suggests that there are a lot of surface defects existing in the perovskite film, which will decrease the efficiency and ruin the stability of PSCs. However, the XPS peaks for metallic Pb disappear in the XPS spectra of the TM5- and TM6-coated perovskite films. This clearly indicates that the coordination of TM5 (or TM6) to Pb2+ can effectively passivate the defects (e.g. VI) of the perovskite film.19
To understand which atoms or groups in TM5 (or TM6) coordinate with the Pb2+ ions in perovskite, we recorded the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra to observe whether the FTIR peaks move, when TM5 (or TM6) and PbI2 (or MAI) are mixed together. Fig. 3a shows the FTIR spectra of TM5, PbI2, and the (PbI2 + TM5) mixture. The FTIR spectrum of the PbI2 sample is featureless, while the FTIR spectra of the TM5 and the (PbI2 + TM5) mixture show several characteristic FTIR peaks in the tested wavenumber range. The C–N and C–O FTIR peaks for the TM5 powder are located at 1242 and 1037 cm−1, respectively. Mixing PbI2 with TM5 shifts the C–N peak from 1242 to 1238 cm−1 and the C–O peak from 1037 to 1032 cm−1. The red shift of the FTIR peak means that the C–N and C–O bonds are weakened in the (PbI2 + TM5) mixture as compared to TM5 alone. This indicates that both the N and O atoms in TM5 can coordinate with the Pb2+ ions in PbI2, which is the cause of red shift for the C–N and C–O FTIR peaks.

(d) FTIR spectra of MAI, TM6, and their mixture. The mixture samples are prepared by dissolving TM5 (or TM6) and PbI2 (or MAI) in DMF under stirring at 30 °C for 2 h, of which the solvent is rotary evaporated out followed by vacuum drying at 85 °C overnight. 
The FTIR spectra of TM6, PbI2, and the (PbI2 + TM6) mixture are shown in Fig. 3b. The C–N and C–S stretching vibration peaks for the TM6 powder appear at 1279 and 1015 cm−1 respectively. After PbI2 is mixed with TM6, the C–N IR peak shifts from 1279 to 1275 cm−1, and the C–S IR peak moves from 1015 to 1010 cm−1. The movement of the IR peak to a lower wavenumber is caused by the formation of coordination bonds (C–N→Pb; C–S→Pb). The force constants of the C–N and C–S bonds are reduced by the decreased electron cloud density due to the coordination, which thus redshifts the IR peak positions.
Formation of hydrogen bonds
Because the O, N and S atoms in TM5 and TM6 have high electronegativity, they are likely to form hydrogen bonds with the H atoms in MA+. Therefore, we tested FTIR to confirm whether there are hydrogen bonds between TM5 (or TM6) and MA+. The FTIR spectra of TM5 and the (TM5 + MAI) mixture are shown in Fig. 3c. The stretching vibrations related to the C–N and C–O groups are respectively located at 1242 and 1037 cm−1 for TM5. After mixing TM5 with MAI, the C–N IR peak does not shift, but the C–O IR peak shifts from 1037 to 1032 cm−1. We thus conclude that the O atoms in the methoxy group of TM5 can form hydrogen bonds with the H atoms in MA+ of perovskite, but the N atoms do not. The red shift of the C–O FTIR peak means a decreased force constant of the C–O bond, which is attributed to the formation of hydrogen bonds.

Fig. 3d shows the IR spectra of TM6 and the (TM6 + MAI) mixture. One can see from Fig. 3d that the C–N stretching vibration peak does not shift, while the C–S stretching vibration peak shifts from 1015 to 1011 cm−1 after TM6 is mixed with MAI. This verifies that the N atoms in TM6 do not form hydrogen bonds with the H atoms of MA+, but the S atoms in TM6 can generate hydrogen bonds with the H atoms of MA+. The formation of hydrogen bonds reduces the force constant of the C–S bond, and therefore the FTIR peak of the C–S bond shifts to a lower wavenumber.
To sum up briefly, the N and O atoms in TM5 as well as the N and S atoms in TM6 can form coordination bonds with the Pb2+ ions of perovskite. However, the N atoms in both TM5 and TM6 do not produce hydrogen bonds with the H atoms of MA+, while the O atoms in TM5 as well as the S atoms in TM6 can form hydrogen bonds with the H atoms of MA+. Since the C–O and C–S groups have a small steric hindrance, the O and S atoms can not only form coordination bonds but also generate hydrogen bonds. Although the N atom has stronger electronegativity than the S atom, the former one does not participate in the formation of hydrogen bonds. The large steric hindrance of the N atoms only allows them to form coordination bonds without enough space to form hydrogen bonds.
Effect on the film morphology
The TM5 (or TM6) coatings may influence the perovskite film morphology, which also plays an important role in solar cell performance. Fig. S24† displays the top-view SEM images of the pristine perovskite (Fig. S24a†), the TM5-coated perovskite (Fig. S24b†), and the TM6-coated perovskite film (Fig. S24c†). Compared with the pristine perovskite film (Fig. S24a†), the SEM images of TM5- (Fig. S24b†) and TM6-coated (Fig. S24c†) perovskite films become blurred, just showing that TM5 (or TM6) are successfully coated on the surface of perovskite films. It can also be seen from the SEM images that the TM5 (or TM6) coating does not change the grain size of perovskite, and the grain size of the three perovskite films is in the range of 150–520 nm.
The atomic force microscope (AFM) images of the above films are shown in Fig. S24d–f,† which can help to study the influence of the interface layer on the surface roughness of the perovskite film. The root-mean square (RMS) surface roughness of the TM5- and TM6-coated perovskite films is determined to be 9.5 and 9.4 nm, respectively, while the RMS surface roughness of the pristine perovskite film is 11.9 nm. The AFM result indicates that the TM5 (or TM6) interface layer can make the perovskite film become smoother.
Effect on the defect passivation
The interaction between the TM molecules and perovskite, together with the improved film morphology, is expected to reduce the defects existing on the perovskite surface. Thus, the defect density of the devices with structures of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/PCBM/Ag and ITO/SnO2/perovskite/TM5 (or TM6)/PCBM/Ag is measured with the SCLC method. As shown in Fig. 4a, the defect-fill limit voltage (VTFL) of the pristine perovskite film, the TM5-coated one, and the TM6-coated one is determined to be 0.708, 0.165 and 0.127 V, respectively. The densities of defects (Nt) calculated by using eqn S2† (ref. 33) are 2.78 × 1015, 6.49 × 1014 and 4.99 × 1014 cm−3, respectively. Apparently, after using TM5 and TM6 as the interfacial layers, the defect density is reduced by nearly an order of magnitude. The significantly reduced defect density is anticipated to improve the hole extraction at the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface, which will be discussed next. We chose TM6 to investigate the thickness effect of the interfacial layer on the Nt of perovskite films. Fig. S25a† shows the SCLC curves of the corresponding devices treated with TM6 of different concentrations. It can be seen that VTFL gradually decreases with increasing the TM6 concentration from 0 to 0.5 mg cm−3 and then remains almost constant with further increasing the concentration of TM6. The relationship between Nt and the TM6 concentration is shown in Fig. S25b.†Nt dwindles by 55% and 82% when the TM6 concentration increases from 0 to 0.3 mg cm−3 and 0.5 mg cm−3, respectively. However, when the TM6 concentration further increases, Nt almost remains unchangeable. It is likely because the TM6 interfacial layer obtained at a concentration of less than 0.5 mg cm−3 cannot completely cover the surface of the perovskite film, but can completely cover the surface at a concentration of greater than or equal to 0.5 mg cm−3. Therefore, further increasing the thickness of the TM6 interfacial layer will no longer affect the Nt of the perovskite film. The SCLC parameters of the devices based on different concentrations of TM6 are listed in Table S5.†

Effect on the hole extraction
The reduced defect density can in principle enhance the hole extraction, which is an important step of photocurrent generation. To verify this point, it is of necessity to perform PL spectroscopy measurements. The steady-state PL spectra of the control, TM5- and TM6-coated perovskite films are shown in Fig. 4b. After spin-coating the TM5 and TM6 interface layers, there is no significant shift in the PL peak position. It is worth noting that the TM5 and TM6 interface layers can reduce the PL intensity of the perovskite film, suggesting the hole transfer from perovskite to the TM5 (or TM6) interface layer that is a sort of HTL and can extract the holes from the perovskite film. To verify the hole extraction by the interface layer, the PL spectra of the TM6-coated perovskite films obtained by spin-coating TM6 chlorobenzene solutions with various concentrations on the perovskite film are recorded (Fig. S26a†). One can find that the PL intensity gradually decreases with increasing the TM6 concentration. The evolution of normalized PL intensity derived from Fig. S26a† with the concentration of TM6 is shown in Fig. S26b.† The PL intensity decreases sharply in the concentration range of 0–2 mg cm−3 of TM6, but the decreasing rate of PL intensity becomes smaller with further increasing the concentration of TM6. This clearly indicates that the hole extraction ability of TM6 increases with the increase of the TM6 layer thickness. The concentration-dependent PL measurement result shows that the interface layer is capable of extracting holes from the perovskite active layer.
Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra are also recorded to further evaluate the influence of the interface layer on the photo-generated carriers. The PL decay curves of the control, TM5- and TM6-coated perovskite films are shown in Fig. S27.† A bi-exponential model (eqn S3†) is used to fit the decay curves and calculate the average carrier lifetime (τave) based on eqn S4.†34 The detailed data are shown in Table S6.† The τave decreases from 269 (control) to 176 (TM5 coating) and to 152 ns (TM6 coating), indicating that the photo-generated holes are transferred from the perovskite to the interface layer, which is consistent with the steady state PL result (Fig. 4b).
To explore the influence of the interface layers on hole transfer between the perovskite and HTL (i.e. spiro-OMeTAD), the PL spectra of ITO/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD and ITO/perovskite/TM5 (or TM6)/spiro-OMeTAD films are recorded and shown in Fig. 4c. The PL results show that the PL intensity is significantly reduced upon the TM5 and TM6 coating on the perovskite film, respectively. The reduction of PL intensity indicates that both TM5 and TM6 can promote the interfacial charge extraction. We conclude that the combination of the TM interface layer and HTL is more conductive to hole extraction than a single HTL. The energy level gradient formed between the three materials (perovskite, TM5 or TM6, and spiro-OMeTAD) accounts for the enhanced hole extraction.35
The TRPL spectra of ITO/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD and ITO/perovskite/TM5 (or TM6)/spiro-OMeTAD films are displayed in Fig. 4d. It is found that the PL decays faster after the TM coating on top of perovskite, and the TM6 coating gives the fastest decay among the three films. The τave of ITO/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD (56 ns), ITO/perovskite/TM5/spiro-OMeTAD (22 ns) and ITO/perovskite/TM6/spiro-OMeTAD (17 ns) is obtained through a similar fitting of Fig. S27.† The detailed fitting data are also shown in Table S6.† After spin-coating the interface layer on the perovskite film, the lower τave further verifies the conclusion drawn from Fig. 4c, namely, the TM5 (or TM6) interface layer markedly improves the hole extraction from perovskite to the HTL.
Effect on solar cell performance
Owing to the defect passivation effect and enhanced hole extraction by TM5 and TM6, the interface layer is bound to positively affect the solar cell performance. Fig. 5a shows the J–V curves of the PSCs based on the pristine perovskite, the TM5-coated perovskite and the TM6-coated one. Compared with the control PSC, Jsc is slightly increased from 22.56 to 23.00 and 23.10 mA cm−2, Voc increased from 1.026 to 1.091 and 1.111 V, and FF increased from 75.23% to 78.03% and 78.62%, after the insertion of TM5 and TM6 interface layers, respectively. The PCE is thus enhanced from 17.42% of the control device to 19.53% and 20.18% for the PSCs with TM5 and TM6 interface layers, respectively. We therefore conclude that both TM5 and TM6 interfacial layers can improve the photovoltaic performance significantly. By comparison, the TM6-coated device produces higher PCE than the TM5-coated one, indicating that TM6 is a better interface layer than TM5.
 Fig. 5  (a) J–V curves and (b) EQE curves of the control, TM5-coated and TM6-coated PSCs. The device structures: ITO/SnO2/MAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au and ITO/SnO2/MAPbI3/TM5 (or TM6)/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. 

Fig. 5b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) action spectra of the three PSCs. In the spectral region of 400–750 nm, the EQE values are obviously enhanced by the interface layer, and TM6 gives more notable improvement than TM5. The calculated integrated photocurrent density (Jcal) of the control, TM5- and TM6-coated PSCs is 21.64, 22.45 and 23.05 mA cm−2, respectively. The changing trend of the integrated photocurrent is consistent with that of the corresponding Jsc measured under AM 1.5G simulated light (100 mW cm−2).
15 parallel devices for each type of PSC were fabricated in the same batch to investigate the device reproducibility. As shown in Fig. S28,† after using TM5 and TM6 as interfacial layers, the device parameters have smaller deviations than those of the control device. This indicates that the TM5 (or TM6) interfacial layer can improve the performance reproducibility. The detailed performance parameters of relevant devices are displayed in Table 1.

The above results clearly indicate that the TM5 (or TM6) interface layer is able to enhance the photovoltaic performance. Next we explore the reasons behind the performance increase. First, we discuss the reasons why the Jsc is increased upon the coating of TM5 and TM6 on the perovskite film, respectively. Light absorption is the source of photocurrent, so we first analyze whether the TM5 (or TM6) coating can cause changes in light absorption. Fig. S29† displays the UV-vis absorption spectra for the control, TM5- and TM6-coated perovskite films. They show similar absorbance in the visible spectral region, indicating that the TM5 and TM6 coatings do not change the light absorption of perovskite. The influence of light absorption can thus be excluded. Effective charge transfer at the interfaces in PSCs is one of the important factors for obtaining high photocurrent.35 After inserting the TM5 (or TM6) interface layer, the hole extraction between the perovskite and HTL is significantly enhanced, which is attributed to the reduced defect density on the perovskite surface passivated by TM5 and TM6, respectively. The enhanced hole extraction helps to increase the Jsc of the device.
Effect on charge recombination
To explore the essential reasons behind the Voc enhancement, the relationship of Voc with light intensity (I) was evaluated. It is well known that Voc is a linear function with the natural logarithm of I [ln(I)], as described in eqn S5.†36Fig. 6a shows that after coating the TM5 and TM6 interface layers on the perovskite film, the slope decreases from 1.98KT/e for the control device to 1.59KT/e and 1.37KT/e, respectively. The TM5- and TM6-coated PSCs have slopes closer to the ideal slope (i.e. KT/e) as compared to the control device, indicating that the TM5 and TM6 interface layers can weaken the defect-assisted charge recombination in the devices.37 The slope of the TM6-coated PSC is closer to KT/e than that of the TM5-coated PSC, reflecting that the TM6 interface layer has higher ability to suppress charge recombination than the TM5 interface layer.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out to further explore the effect of the interface layer on charge recombination. Fig. 6b shows the EIS Nyquist curves of TM5- and TM6-coated PSCs with the uncoated device as a control. The control cell shows two semicircles in the EIS spectrum, where the larger semicircle (left) in the high frequency region represents the charge recombination behavior, and the smaller one (right) in the low frequency region is assigned to the charge transfer process. By contrast, the TM5- and TM6-coated devices only show one big semicircle in the high frequency region, while the arc in the low frequency region is too small to be covered up. After fitting the Nyquist plots with the equivalent circuit (inset in Fig. 6b), the charge recombination resistance (Rrec) and charge transfer resistance (Rct) are derived. The fitted Rrec of the control, TM5- and TM6-coated devices is 2177, 2687 and 2856 Ω, respectively. The larger Rrec for the TM5- and TM6-coated devices than the control PSC indicates that the TM5- and TM6-coating can suppress charge recombination, which is attributed to the lower defect density for the TM-coated PSCs. The retarded charge recombination is the main reason for the Voc improvement. The fitted Rct of the control, TM5- and TM6-coated devices is 226, 20 and 11 Ω, respectively. The reduction in Rct upon the TM5- and TM6-coating means that the interfacial charge extraction becomes more efficient, which is responsible for the enhanced FF and Jsc.
To further explain the improvement of Voc, we tested the Mott–Schottky curves of the control, TM5- and TM6-coated PSCs, as shown in Fig. 6c and the relationship between capacitance (C) and potential is represented by eqn S6.†38 The built-in potential (Vbi) can be extracted from the linear part of the Mott–Schottky plots. The Vbi of TM5- and TM6-coated PSCs is 0.96 and 1.00 V, respectively, which are significantly higher than that of the control (Vbi = 0.87 V). Higher Vbi means that the interface layer increases the driving force to separate photo-generated charge carriers. This inhibits charge recombination and hence contributes to achieving higher Voc.39 We also calculated the interface carrier concentration from Fig. 6c based on eqn S6.†38 The interface carrier concentration of the control PSC is 7.19 × 1018 cm−3, while the interface carrier concentrations of the TM5- and TM6-coated PSCs are 6.13 × 1018 and 5.96 × 1018 cm−3 respectively (Table S7†). The interface layers can approximately reduce the carrier concentration at the interface by 20%, indicating that the TM5 and TM6 coating can efficiently promote hole transfer from perovskite to the HTL. By comparison, the TM6-coated PSC has higher Vbi and lower interface carrier concentration than the TM5-coated PSC. As a consequence, the TM6 interface layer achieves higher Voc than the TM5 interface layer.
Open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) analysis was also conducted to further decipher the effect of the interface layer on the charge recombination dynamics of PSCs. Simulated AM 1.5G solar light (100 mW cm−2) is used to illuminate the PSCs for 6 s followed by turning off the light. The transient Voc values of the control, TM5- and TM6-coated PSCs are recorded with time and plotted in Fig. 6d. By comparison, the control PSC shows a fastest voltage decay, the TM5-coated PSC is in the middle, and the TM6-coated PSC gives the slowest decay. We thus conclude that the TM coating can inhibit charge recombination and TM6 is superior to TM5 in this respect.
Protective effect on perovskite
The dopant of Li salt in spiro-OMeTAD has strong hygroscopicity, which is detrimental to the stability of perovskite when the doped spiro-OMeTAD is directly deposited on the perovskite film. Based on this consideration, we try to cover the perovskite film with a hydrophobic material so that the coated perovskite can be kept from water. The water contact angles of ITO/TM5 and ITO/TM6 films are measured to be 96.6° (Fig. S30a†) and 99.2° (Fig. S30b†) respectively, suggesting the strong hydrophobicity of TM5 and TM6 materials. When the hydrophobic TM5 (or TM6) interface layer is inserted between the perovskite film and spiro-OMeTAD HTL, the latter two layers are physically separated, thus minimizing the influence of hygroscopic dopants in spiro-OMeTAD on perovskite. This is favorable for improving the humid stability of PSCs. Importantly, TM5 and TM6 do not decrease the hole transfer from perovskite to spiro-OMeTAD but promote hole extraction because both of them are high-performance hole transport materials.
The changes of the water contact angle of the perovskite films after being coated with TM5 and TM6 respectively are shown in Fig. S30c–e.† It is found that the water contact angle increases significantly from 57.6° for the pristine perovskite film (Fig. S30c†) to 96.2° for the TM5-coated perovskite (Fig. S30d†) and 97.9° for the TM6-coated perovskite (Fig. S30e†). As expected, the hydrophobicity of the perovskite layer can be increased markedly using the TM5 (or TM6) coating. We therefore think of the TM coating as the protective layer for the perovskite film against water, which can prevent the decomposition of perovskite caused by water.
The evolution of XRD patterns with time at 20–30 °C and 85–90% relative humidity (RH) was recorded (Fig. 7a–c). Fig. 7a shows the XRD spectra of the pristine perovskite film over time. It can be seen from Fig. 7a that the pristine MAPbI3 gradually transforms into the hydrates of perovskite (MAPbI3·H2O and MAPbI3·2H2O).40 This is bound to cause a decrease in light absorption with time, as displayed in Fig. S31a.† Owing to the strong hydrophobic properties of TM5 and TM6, no XRD peaks for the hydrates of perovskite were observed for the TM5- (Fig. 7b) and TM6-coated (Fig. 7c) perovskite films under the same conditions. The evolution of the XRD pattern proves that the TM5 (or TM6) coating can protect the perovskite film from water. As a consequence, the light absorption in the visible spectral region is only slightly reduced within 60 h for the TM5- (Fig. S31b†) and TM6-coated (Fig. S31c†) perovskite films.
 Fig. 7  Evolution of XRD spectra with time at 20–30 °C and 85–90% RH for perovskite films with the structures of (a) ITO/SnO2/perovskite, (b) ITO/SnO2/perovskite/TM5, and (c) ITO/SnO2/perovskite/TM6. (d) Evolution of PCE with time for the unencapsulated PSCs at 20–30 °C with 30–40% RH. 
Owing to the presence of water in the film, the perovskite will decompose with time. It can be seen from the photos (Fig. S32a†) that the color of the pristine perovskite film starts to turn yellow at 12 h, suggesting that the perovskite begins to decompose at this time. The film turns completely yellow at 60 h, signifying complete conversion of perovskite to PbI2. However, the films respectively coated with TM5 (Fig. S32b†) and TM6 (Fig. S32c†), under the same conditions, remain black within 60 h, indicating improved stability by the TM5 (or TM6) coating.
The long-term stability of the devices is a key parameter to realize the commercial fabrication of PSCs. Therefore, we investigate the effect of interface layers on the stability of PSCs. Fig. 7d shows the PCE evolution of PSCs at 20–30 °C and 30–40% RH. The TM5- and TM6-coated devices respectively maintain 95% and 97% of the initial PCE after 1056 h storage in the dark, while the PCE of the control decreases to 57% of the initial efficiency under the same conditions. The stability of PSCs under constant illumination and at the maximum power point is also studied. Fig. S33† shows the PCE–time curves for the unencapsulated PSCs under continuous 1 sun (AM 1.5G) illumination (20–30 °C and 85–90% RH). It is found that after 675 s of operation the PCE of the control PSC rapidly decays to 73.1% of the initial PCE, while the TM5- and TM6-coated PSCs maintain 93.1% and 93.8% of their starting PCE values, respectively.
Obviously, the stability is significantly improved after using TM5 and TM6 as interfacial layers, which can be attributed to the reduced defect density,41 strong hydrophobicity and the physical separation between perovskite and the dopants in the HTL. Additionally, the hydrogen bonds formed between the O (or S) atoms in TM5 (or TM6) and H atoms in MA+ are helpful to stabilize MA+ in the perovskite film, and hence the device stability is enhanced.42
Conclusions
We design and synthesize two novel organic hole transport materials: TM5 and TM6 based on indolocarbazole combined with triphenylamine, and successfully employ them as the interfacial layers in n–i–p PSCs. The two materials have three functions: hole transport, defect passivation and waterproofing. The coordination and hydrogen bonds can be formed between TM5 (or TM6) and perovskite, which reduces the defect density by about an order of magnitude and results in increased hole extraction. As compared with TM5, TM6 can more efficiently passivate the defects in the perovskite film, thereby better improving the performance of PSCs. After inserting TM5 and TM6 interface layers, the PCE of the devices increases from pristine 17.42% to 19.53% and 20.18%, respectively. A gradient band structure is formed between the perovskite, TM layer and HTL, which further enhances the interfacial charge extraction and boosts the Jsc of PSCs. The TM coating can also suppress charge recombination and increase the built-in potential, contributing to Voc gain. Additionally, the interfacial layer enhances the hydrophobic properties of the perovskite film, thereby improving the stability of the perovskite films under high humidity conditions. The TM coating can hence enhance the stability of PSCs. The TM5- and TM6-coated PSCs can respectively retain 95% and 97% of the initial PCE after 1056 h aging under 20–30 °C and 30–40% RH conditions, in contrast to 57% for the control cell. This study provides new avenues for designing efficient interface materials.
