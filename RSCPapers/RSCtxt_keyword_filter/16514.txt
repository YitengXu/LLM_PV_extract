    , Accepted 29th March 2012First published on 16th May 2012AbstractPorous polyaniline–camphorsulfonic acid (PANI–CSA) counter-electrodes (CEs) for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were fabricated by secondary doping-based polymerization with different porogen decomposition. The average pore diameter was ca. 50 and 150 nm for BPO and AIBN, respectively. The increased Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of porous PANI–CSA CEs facilitated facile electron exchange between the CEs and the redox electrolyte, resulting in higher electro-catalytic performance than that of Pt-coated indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) CE. The porous PANI–CSA nanostructures with increased BET surface area exhibited an equivalent incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) of 68.86% and a power-conversion efficiency (PCE, η) of 6.23% compared to DSSCs containing Pt-coated ITO CE (IPCE of 68.70% and η = 6.17%). It is noteworthy that the performance of DSSCs with porous PANI–CSA CEs represented a 101.0% relative efficiency compared to Pt-coated CEs.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted interest over the past two decades due to their low cost, simple fabrication, and eco-friendliness.1,2 In a conventional DSSC system, the device includes a nanocrystalline semiconductor (NCS) electrode, dye-sensitizer, redox electrolyte, and counter-electrode (CE). Various efforts have been made to enhance the overall performance of DSSCs, such as modifying the morphology of NCS3–10 and the molecular structures of organic sensitizers11–17 as well as using low-volatility electrolytes18–20 and new CE materials.21–57
The role of the CE is to facilitate the reduction of triiodide ions (I3−) from iodide ions (I−) in the redox electrolytes. Platinum (Pt)-coated transparent conductive oxides (TCOs), such as indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) or fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), have generally been used as CEs in DSSCs due to the high electro-catalytic activity for triiodide reduction of Pt and high conductivity of TCOs. However, Pt-coated TCOs are expensive to produce and are incompatible with the I−/I3− redox electrolyte.20,21
Various CEs based on carbon materials,22–32 metals,33–35 conductive polymers,21,36–44 and hybrid-structured materials have been made to substitute the Pt and TCO. Recently, Grätzel et al. reported an approximately 9% maximum performance with carbon black.23,24 Another approach involved applying metal sulfides including selenized copper zinc tin sulfide (CZTSSe)33 and cobalt sulfide (CoS)34 to the CEs, resulting in a power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.37 and 6.52%, respectively. Conductive polymers, such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiphene) (PEDOT),36–40 polyaniline (PANI),41,42 and polypyrrole (PPy),43,44 have been investigated as alternative materials for Pt CEs. Furthermore, new types of hybrid structured materials such as carbon-modified Pt,45–47 graphene-modified Pt,48,49 metal-modified Pt,50 graphene–carbon nanotube (CNT) composites,51,52 graphene–metal nitride composites,53 carbon–polymer composites,54–56 and metal–polymer composites57 have been developed as CEs to obtain high PCE of the DSSCs. However, most candidates have relatively low conversion efficiency compared to Pt CEs, and many depend heavily on mechanically brittle TCO glass substrates. Therefore, it is desirable to develop a simple and cost-effective method for fabricating CEs in DSSCs.
In addition to the intrinsic advantages of PANI, such as environmental stability, low cost, unique redox characteristics, and high conductivity,58–64 polyaniline–camphorsulfonic acid (PANI–CSA) systems have strong polar and hydrogen bonding between m-cresol and PANI–CSA, leading to higher conductivity than one-dimensional conductive polymer nanomaterials such as fibers, rods, and particles.65–68 However, the lower surface area of film-type conductive polymers, including PANI–CSA, compared to their carbon and inorganic counterparts has limited the performance of DSSCs. Germain et al. reported that porous structures have the ability to increase the surface area of polymers.69 In addition, the electro-catalytic activity of CEs can be promoted increasing the BET surface area of CEs.30,31 Thus, porous conductive polymers offer a new pathway to enhance the PCE for DSSCs. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports of using porous PANI–CSA as CEs for DSSCs.
Herein, we report a novel method for the fabrication of porous PANI–CSA nanostructured CEs for high-performance DSSCs. Porous nanostructures of PANI–CSA CEs were readily obtained via decomposition of embedded porogens. In the case of BPO, porous PANI–CSA CEs fabricated by the new method exhibited an increased Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of 36.98 m2 g−1 and enhanced electro-catalytic activity compared to both pristine PANI–CSA and Pt-coated ITO. Furthermore, they were successfully used as Pt- and TCO-free CEs in DSSCs, resulting in a power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of η = 6.23% and excellent efficiency of 101.0% compared to a DSSC with a conventional Pt-coated ITO CE (ηpt = 6.17%).
Experimental section
Materials
Aniline (99.0%), ammonium persulfate (APS, 98.0%), camphorsulfonic acid (CSA, 98.0%), benzoyl peroxide (BPO), azoisobutyronitrile (AIBN), titanium(IV) tetraisopropoxide (TTIP, 98.0%), acetronitrile (ACN, 99.9%), ethanol (EtOH, 99.5%), terpineol, ethyl cellulose (5% in toluene–ethanol 80:20), lauric acid (98.0%), lithium perchlorate (LiClO4, 98.0%) and chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, USA). Hydrogen chloride (HCl, 35.0%), chloroform (CHCl3), and ammonia solution (NH3) were purchased from Samchun (Seoul, Korea). m-Cresol was acquired from Tokyo Chemical Industry (Tokyo, Japan). TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) (Ti-nanoxide D), cis-diisothiocyanato-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II) bis(tetrabutylammonium) (N719), and an iodide-based redox electrolyte (AN50) were purchased from Solaronix (Aubonne, Switzerland). FTO glass (7 Ω cm−2, thickness of 2.2 mm) was obtained from Pilkington (Toledo, USA).
Fabrication of porous PANI–CSA nanostructured CEs
PANI emeraldine salt (ES) was synthesized according to the procedure described by Lee et al.65 Hydrogen chloride, a primary dopant for the aniline monomer, was introduced into distilled water (30 mL). Then, aniline (21 mmol) was added drop-wise into the solution and vigorously stirred for 10 min at 25 °C. The aqueous anilinium ion solution was mixed with 60 mL CHCl3. APS (2.4 g) was used as an oxidizing agent to initiate polymerization of aniline at −30 °C for 8 h. The overall reaction progressed at the interface between the aqueous phase and chloroform. A greenish PANI ES powder was obtained after washing with water, ethanol, and acetone. PANI ES was reduced to a PANI emeraldine base (EB) by adding 0.5 M NH3 solution, and brownish PANI EB powder was obtained after washing with ethanol and acetone. The secondary doping process of the de-doped PANI EB powder was conducted using CSA. Porogens, including BPO (0.025–0.10 g) and AIBN (0.025–0.10 g), were added to 0.2 g of CSA-doped PANI powders, respectively. Each PANI–CSA powder and porogen was dissolved in 5.0 mL m-cresol. The PANI–CSA solutions were sonicated for 24 h to remove insoluble dispersions within the solutions. The resulting PANI–CSA solutions were fabricated as 10 μm thin films onto an area (1.5 cm2) of non-conducting glass substrate using a spin-coater (PWM32, Headway Research Inc., USA) at 500 rpm for 10 s. PANI–CSA was dried in two steps on the substrates. First, m-cresol was evaporated for 12 h at 40 °C. Then, to induce porogen decomposition of BPO and AIBN within the PANI–CSA films, an additional drying step was performed for 3 h at 100 °C. To compare the overall performance to conventional DSSCs, a Pt-coated ITO was prepared by adding 0.25 mL of 5 mM chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate to an area (1.5 cm2) of the ITO substrate followed by heating treatment at 400 °C for 30 min.
Assembly of DSSCs with CEs
Two steps of preparing TiO2 paste were conducted to obtain highly viscous TiO2 paste. Firstly, terpineol (2.25 mL), ethyl cellulose (0.1 g), and lauric acid (0.18 g) were mixed followed by sonication for 24 h. Then, the as-prepared solution was mixed with the TiO2 NPs by vigorous stirring. FTO glasses were immersed into an aqueous TTIP solution at 60 °C for 30 min before depositing the TiO2 paste onto the FTO glasses. TiO2 thin films were deposited onto active areas (0.25 cm2) of FTO glasses. Sintering of the TiO2-coated FTO glasses were conducted at 450 °C for 30 min. The FTO glasses with TiO2 thin films were immersed in the dye solution (0.5 mM N719 dye in acetonitrile and t-butanol (volume ratio of 1:1)) for 36 h at 25 °C. As-prepared working electrodes were assembled with CEs into sandwich-type cells using thermal adhesive films (Surlyn: 60 μm, Dupont). A drop of the redox electrolyte (50 mM triiodide, 0.1 M LiI, and 0.5 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide in acetonitrile) was injected into the cell.
Instrumentation
Morphological images of the PANI–CSA nanostructures were acquired using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JSM-6701F, JEOL, Japan) and atomic force microscopy (AFM, Innova SPM, Vecco, USA). The conductivities of PANI–CSA CEs were measured using a four-line probe system (Mode Systems Co., Korea) equipped with a current-source meter (Keithley 2400, Keithley Co., USA). BET surface areas and total pore volumes of the PANI–CSA were acquired using a Micromeritic analyzer (ASAP 2000, Micromeritic Co., USA). The electro-catalytic activities of the PANI–CSA CEs were evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV, WBCS 3000, Korea) with 10 mM acetonitrile, 1 mM I2, and 0.1 M LiClO4 as an electrolyte. The photocurrent–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the assembled DSSCs were evaluated using a 500 W xenon lamp (XIL model 05A50KS source units). Incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a Solar Cell Spectral Response QE/IPCE Measurement System (QEX7, PV Measurements, Inc. Boulder, USA) from 300 nm to 800 nm under the global AM 1.5 solar emission spectrum.
Results and discussion
Outline for the experimental procedures
The overall procedure for the fabrication of porous PANI–CSA nanostructured CEs is illustrated in Scheme 1. The prepared PANI–CSA solution was added to non-conducting glass substrates as a thin film by spin-coating. To produce high-PCE DSSCs, it is necessary to control the thickness of PANI–CSA. Catalytic material that is too thick has low connectivity between domains of the conductive area. The optimized thickness of porous PANI–CSA for CEs was chosen as ca. 10 μm. Fig. 1 shows the reactions of pore-formation within PANI–CSA. Gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) from BPO and nitrogen (N2) were emitted from the surface of the PANI–CSA by porogen decomposition via thermal treatment, generating pores with different diameters and shapes on the PANI–CSA CEs (Fig. 1a and b, respectively).

Characterization of porous PANI–CSA CEs
The atomic force micrographs (AFMs) in Fig. 2 and 3 show the PANI–CSA CEs formed by the decomposition of different porogens. The average grain size of the PANI–CSA CEs was between 40 and 80 nm in the pristine CE and in the CEs that had been made porous by BPO and AIBN (Fig. 2a, b, and 2c, respectively). In contrast to pristine PANI–CSA, pores with diameters of around ca. 50 and 150 nm were observed on the surfaces of BPO– and AIBN–PANI–CSA CEs, respectively (Fig. 2b and c). These porous PANI–CSA CEs were compared by comparing their heights using cross-sectional analysis. As the amount of porogen increased, the surface roughness of the PANI–CSA CEs increased, indicating that porogen decomposition within PANI–CSA causes incremental increases in surface roughness as well as solvent evaporation (Fig. 3).

Fig. 4 displays the dependence of conductivity versus surface roughness for varying amounts of porogens. Conductivities of PANI–CSA CEs were measured using the four-line probe method.70,71 According to eqn (1), (1)where ρ is the static resistivity, R is the sheet resistivity and t is the thickness of the PANI–CSA on CE. Conductivity indicates the ability to conduct electric current at the CEs. For this reason, reasonably high conductivity of the PANI–CSA CE is required for facile electron transfer from CEs to redox electrolyte. Conductivity of PANI–CSA CE is susceptible to surface roughness, which involves the morphological information of PANI–CSA CE (Fig. 4). Although rougher surfaces of BPO- and AIBN-PANI–CSA CEs result in larger specific surface areas than that of pristine PANI–CSA CE, the increase of surface roughness is a reason for reduced connectivity between conductive areas within PANI–CSA CEs. Therefore, surface roughness of PANI–CSA CEs should be controlled properly to obtain well-retained conductivity of PANI–CSA CEs. More retained conductivity of BPO-PANI–CSA than that of AIBN-PANI–CSA is attributed to better connectivity between grains within BPO-PANI–CSA CE, resulting in lower sheet resistance for the facile electron transfer and higher electro-catalytic activity at the CEs.72,73 In the present study, BPO (Fig. 3a) resulted in not only a porous structure, but also less surface roughness and thus a better connection between grains than AIBN (Fig. 3a and b, respectively). Therefore, our results suggest that BPO is a more desirable porogen than AIBN. Importantly, favorable morphology of surface was achieved by optimizing the amount of porogen; this is a crucial factor for obtaining high-performance CEs in DSSCs, as discussed below.
 Fig. 4  Conductivity and surface roughness of PANI–CSA CEs fabricated by varying amounts of porogens. 
To clarify the effects of pores on PANI–CSA CEs, surface areas of powdered PANI–CSA were calculated using the BET method (Table 1). When pores were generated on PANI–CSA, the BET surface area of BPO-PANI–CSA increased to more than four times that of pristine PANI–CSA. AIBN-PANI–CSA exhibited approximately three times larger BET surface areas and pore volumes than pristine PANI–CSA. Thus, pores generated on PANI–CSA highly contributed to the increased BET surface area.

The performances of DSSCs with porous PANI–CSA CEs
CV, IPCE, and photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) tests were performed (Fig. 5, 6, 7, and Table 2) to compare the overall performances of DSSCs with porous PANI–CSA nanostructures to that of Pt-coated ITO. To understand the influence of the porous structure on the electrochemical activity, cyclic voltammograms of PANI–CSA CEs and the Pt-coated ITO CE for the triiodide–iodide (I3−/I−) redox couple were measured (Fig. 5). The Pt-coated ITO CE had cathodic and anodic peaks at −0.086 V and 0.46 V, respectively. The cathodic peak of Pt was assigned to the reaction of eqn (2), and the anodic peak of Pt was assigned to the reaction of eqn (3): 3I2 + 2e− ⇆ 2I3−(2) I3− + 2e− ⇆ 3I−(3)

The cathodic peaks of the PANI–CSA CEs ranged from −0.14 to 0.04 V and corresponded to the reaction of eqn (2), and the anodic peaks of PANI–CSA CEs ranged from 0.68 to 0.92 V and corresponded to the reaction of eqn (3). Moreover, every PANI–CSA CE showed a different CV curve with different current density. The shapes of the CV curves were attributed to the redox-sensitive characteristic of PANI.64 BPO-PANI–CSA CEs showed a strong anodic peak current in the range of 3.89 to 5.89 mA cm−2 and a cathodic peak current in the range of −3.04 to −4.26 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5a). The Pt-coated ITO CE and pristine PANI/CSA CE had anodic peak currents of −0.81 and 2.44 mA cm−2 and cathodic peak currents of −2.19 and −2.38 mA cm−2, respectively. The increased photocurrent density for the anodic and cathodic peaks of porous PANI–CSA CEs indicates not only increased ability for transitions between leucomeraldine, emeraldine, and pernigraniline within the PANI structure64 but also reflects rapid reduction of I3− to I− at the porous PANI–CSA CEs. Although AIBN-PANI–CSA CEs had weaker current densities than BPO-PANI–CSA CEs, the anodic peak values (2.59 to 3.43 mA cm−2) and the cathodic peak values (−2.78 to −3.45 mA cm−2) were higher than those of Pt-coated ITO and pristine PANI–CSA CE (Fig. 5b). Importantly, the higher electro-catalytic activities at BPO- and AIBN-PANI–CSA CEs than Pt-coated ITO and pristine PANI–CSA CEs are likely due to favorable roughness and porous structures resulting from the addition of optimal amounts of porogens. Consequently, porous PANI–CSA CEs with favorable surface morphologies offered larger surface area, resulting in higher electro-catalytic activity for diffusion of I3− and I− ions in the CEs than do pristine PANI–CSA and Pt-coated CEs.30,31
The IPCE spectra of DSSCs with PANI–CSA CEs and the Pt-coated ITO CE are shown in Fig. 6. The IPCE curves of the CEs were measured by using the reported method.12 The IPCE curve (λ) could be defined as eqn (4), IPCE(λ) = 1240(Jsc/λ∅)(4)where λ is the wavelength, Jsc is the current at short circuit (mA cm−2), and ∅ is the incident radiative flux. BPO-PANI–CSA CEs had higher IPCEs than AIBN-PANI–CSA CEs (Fig. 6a). Every DSSC with a porous PANI–CSA CE had a higher IPCE than those containing pristine PANI–CSA (Fig. 6a and b). The optimized DSSC with the BPO-PANI–CSA CE exhibited an equivalent IPCE, 68.86%, compared to the Pt-coated ITO cell (68.70%). The IPCE results indicate that the increased active surface area of porous PANI–CSA enhanced the ability of CEs to harvest light in the broad spectral region with increased emission of electrons per induced photons. Moreover, the photo-catalytic performances of PANI–CSA CEs were consistent with the results of surface roughness and electro-catalytic activity of PANI–CSA CEs.
The J–V characteristics of DSSCs with PANI–CSA CEs and the Pt-coated ITO CE are shown in Fig. 7. Table 2 summarizes the photovoltaic parameters such as short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), IPCE (%), and overall PCE (η). As mentioned above, the DSSCs containing PANI–CSA CEs with appropriate surface roughness showed optimal DSSC performance. The DSSC containing the BPO-PANI–CSA CE showed the best performance with η = 6.23%, Jsc = 12.4 mA cm−2, and Voc = 0.80 V (Fig. 7a). The DSSC with the pristine PANI–CSA CE had η = 4.02%, Jsc = 9.16 mA cm−2, and Voc = 0.67 V. DSSCs containing AIBN-PANI–CSA CEs also exhibited enhanced PCEs of 5.24% compared to the DSSC with the pristine PANI–CSA CE (Fig. 7b). As aforementioned, higher Jsc of BPO- and AIBN-PANI–CSA than that of pristine PANI–CSA CE is due to enhanced electro-catalytic activity for facile reduction of I3− ions at the CEs, resulting from favorable surface morphologies of BPO- and AIBN-PANI–CSA CEs.45 In addition, higher Jsc of BPO-PANI–CSA CE compared to AIBN-PANI–CSA CE could be attributed to small loss of conductivity, indicating better electron transfer at the BPO-PANI–CSA CE. Moreover, the increased electro-catalytic ability for fast reduction of I3− ions at the BPO- and AIBN-PANI–CSA CEs results in the reduced availability of I3− ions for recombination with photoinjected electrons, resulting in higher Voc of BPO- and AIBN-PANI–CSA CEs than the pristine PANI–CSA CE.56 However, pristine PANI–CSA CE has insufficient pores for diffusion of I3− and I− ions compared to BPO- and AIBN-PANI–CSA CEs. Therefore, the structure of pristine PANI–CSA CE reduces the number of effective sites for I3− reduction, resulting in the increased availability of recombination between I3− ions and the photoinjected electrons at the CE. According to eqn (5), Voc is the difference between the Fermi level of a TiO2 semiconductor (EF,TiO2) and the formal potential of the I3−/I− couple in the redox electrolyte.32 (5)
Assuming that the TiO2 semiconductor in the DSSCs remains unchanged, Voc depends on the  of the CE. Because of enhanced diffusion and adsorption of I3− ions at the porous PANI–CSA CEs,  of the porous PANI–CSA CEs shifts more positively than the pristine PANI–CSA CE. Thus, the higher Voc of the BPO- and AIBN-PANI–CSA CEs than the pristine PANI–CSA CE is attributed to the positive shift of formal potential of I3−/I− redox reaction at the CEs.30–32 Accordingly, porous PANI–CSA CEs had much higher electro-catalytic abilities than the pristine PANI–CSA CE. The maximum PCE of the Pt-coated ITO cell was η = 6.17%, and the value was almost the same as the maximum PCE of the porous PANI–CSA CE-based cell. In addition, the porous PANI–CSA CE-based cell had a higher Voc of 0.80 V and the same Jsc of 12.4 mA cm−2 compared to the Pt-coated ITO cell (Voc = 0.73 V and Jsc = 12.4 mA cm−2). Although no significant trends in FF were observed, the overall FF of porous PANI–CSA CE-based cells was slightly higher than that of the pristine PANI–CSA CE-based cell. Notably, the relative efficiency of the porous PANI–CSA CE-based cell was 101.0% compared to the Pt-coated ITO CE-based cell. Thus, porous PANI–CSA CEs offered significantly enhanced DSSC performance, and thus offer new possibilities for obtaining high-performance DSSCs without using TCO or Pt.
Conclusions
A facile strategy for enhanced DSSC performance was demonstrated by fabricating porous PANI–CSA as CEs in DSSCs. Pores of different shapes and sizes were readily formed on PANI–CSA CEs by introducing BPO and AIBN. The generated pores increased the BET surface area of the CEs, resulting in facile electron transfer and high electro-catalytic activity between the CE and the electrolyte in the DSSCs. Furthermore, the best DSSC performance was achieved by adding optimal amounts of porogens to the PANI–CSA. By controlling the surface roughness of porous PANI–CSA CEs, a PCE of η = 6.23% was obtained. This is the highest efficiency to date using solution-processable conductive polymers with Pt- and TCO-free CEs. Our work achieved an efficiency of 101.0% compared to the Pt-coated cell. Furthermore, enhanced light harvesting ability with an IPCE of 68.86% could be obtained by containing porous PANI–CSA nanostructured CEs in the DSSCs. Thus, the performance of porous PANI–CSA nanostructured CEs with optimized surface roughness was comparable to that of conventional DSSCs with Pt CEs. In addition, the porous PANI–CSA can be utilized as a CE material for practical applications in large-scale DSSCs due to its excellent solution processability and wettability on various substrates.
