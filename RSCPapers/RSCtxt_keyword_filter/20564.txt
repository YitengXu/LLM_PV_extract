Nevertheless, the recovery of near-room-temperature waste heat remains challenging because the slight temperature difference with the surroundings leads to extremely low thermoelectric power generation. In this study, we combined a daytime radiative cooling (DRC) technology with a thermoelectric generator (TEG) to efficiently recover near-room-temperature waste heat. We investigated the effects of the thermal radiation and thermal conduction properties of DRC materials on near-room-temperature waste heat recovery (WHR). We designed a hierarchical micro–nano h-BN/ZnO composite (MNHZC) that possessed an outstanding daytime radiative cooling ability and moderate thermal conductivity. With this hierarchical h-BN/ZnO composite, we achieved record-high levels of thermoelectric power generation of 225.3 and 412.3 mW m−2 during the daytime and nighttime, respectively, with enhancements in thermoelectric power of 1030 and 190%, respectively. The attractive power generation ability of the MNHZC/TEG system suggests its great potential in low-grade waste heat recovery and environmental energy harvesting by consistently generating power in both the daytime and nighttime.
Introduction
The rapid growth of global industry is resulting in increased energy demands. The emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) and waste heat has the potential to lead to severe global warming. Energy recovery techniques and energy harvesting from non-fossil fuels will likely become important processes for slowing down the effects of global warming. In recent years, many countries have begun to focus on the issue of waste heat generation from energy-intensive industries. The US Department of Energy reported that energy-intensive industries consume approximately 8400 TBtu per year (9% of the total energy consumed in the US), with approximately 1500 TBtu per year being lost as waste heat in exhaust gases.1 Moreover, most of the waste heat, accounting for 660 TBtu per year, is in the temperature range below 150 °C. In addition, energy-intensive industries, including cement, glass, and iron/steel in China, contribute approximately 40, 1.8, and 2.9 GWth, respectively, to the waste heat capacity, with over 40% of the waste heat potential being at temperatures below 150 °C.2 A recent report describing waste heat in the EU revealed that over one third of this waste heat from energy-extensive industries has temperatures below 200 °C.3 Nevertheless, the low temperature of LWH leads to low conversion efficiencies, making it challenging to generate significant amounts of energy. Many efforts have been reported to enhance the efficiency of low-grade waste, including thermogalvanic cells4,5 and thermoelectric generator (TEG) hybrids with hydrogels.6 The potential of recovering low-grade waste heat (LWH) is crucial to harvest energy.
A TEG is a powerful tool for recovering medium- and low-grade waste heat. Because of their compact size, long life spans, high reliability, silent operation, and moderate output power performance,7 TEGs have been applied to recover waste heat from various waste heat resources, both industrially8–11 and in personal devices.12–16 The ZT value of a thermoelectric material is the most crucial figure of merit of a TEG device; it can be defined asZT = (S2ρ/κ)Twhere S is the Seebeck coefficient, ρ is the electrical conductivity, κ is the thermal conductivity, and T is the average temperature of the hot and cold sides. Nevertheless, few materials have high ZT values suitable for low-temperature WHR. To achieve higher ZT values, many efforts have been made to improve the performance of thermoelectric materials, including enhancing Seebeck coefficients, band structure engineering,17 and lowering the lattice thermal conductance18 (e.g., forming nanostructured materials). Improvements in the ZT values for the low-temperature range (30–250 °C) have, however, slowed in recent years.19 Materials having moderate ZT values (0.5–1.5), and that are commercially available at low cost, are rare in the low-temperature range. (Bi, Sb)2Te3 is the most common TEG material displaying outstanding performance, at a reasonable price, in the low-temperature range. According to the level of doping, the ZT values of (Bi, Sb)2Te3 range from 0.5 to 1.5.20 The development of Bi2Te3 dates back to 1954,21 yet its ZT value of 0.51 has not improved much since then. Although nanostructured versions of (Bi, Sb)2Te3 can potentially enhance ZT to greater than 1, by decreasing lattice thermal conductivity,22–24 such nanostructured TEG materials are expensive. Therefore, we are interested in finding alternative routes for increasing the efficiency of TEG materials in the low temperature range, rather than focusing on increasing ZT values.
Research into radiative cooling has attracted much attention in recent years.25–30 Thanks to the infrared (IR) atmosphere window (λ = 8–13 μm) in the sky, thermal radiation from the Earth can be transmitted directly into outer space. By directly exchanging heat with the cold outer space (T = 4 K), radiative cooling materials can have net cooling power, and an equilibrium temperature below the ambient temperature.31 The superior properties of radiative cooling are desirable for cooling the environment without spending extra energy. The applications of radiative cooling include building cooling,25,32,33 human textiles,28,34–37 and solar cells.38–41 Raman et al. demonstrated that outer space could be used as a cold source to generate electrical power at near ambient temperature at nighttime.42 Using a broadband black thermal absorber having an area of 100 cm2 to cool down the cold side of a TEG having an area of 9 cm2, they were able to power a light-emitting diode (LED) to 10% of its maximum brightness at nighttime, generating an output power of 25 mW m−2. Nevertheless, the large area ratio between the cooler and the TEG made the whole device bulky, and the broadband black thermal absorber, with a high solar absorption, made the TEG device difficult to operate during the daytime.
Daytime radiative cooling (DRC) is an attractive concept, but more difficult to develop than radiative cooling alone. DRC requires extremely low solar absorption under direct sunlight and an optimized IR emission within the atmosphere window.30 Materials with DRC ability can reject sunlight while maintaining high emissivity in the IR range, thereby exchanging heat with cold outer space. Mu et al. used cold outer space as the cold source to fabricate an all-day self-powering wafer-scale TEG device.43 They fabricated multilayered SiO2/Si3N4 on an Ag substrate as the thermal absorber, with an emissivity of approximately 80% at wavelengths of 8–13 μm, to generate the open-circuit voltage of the TEG during both daytime and nighttime. Although the device displayed an open-circuit voltage of 418.8 mV m−2 in the nighttime, the open-circuit voltage in the daytime was almost negligible. Zhilin et al. used a porous SiO2 film as a DRC surface to cool the cold side of a TEG and generate power throughout the day.44 Nevertheless, when the experiment was run on a cloudy day with a solar intensity of approximately 150 W m−2, the open-circuit voltage was nearly negligible during the daytime.
In this study, we applied a DRC on a TEG to lower the cold-side temperature and, thereby, generate near-room-temperature WHR. By using a DRC on a commercial TEG, the output power of the TEG could be enhanced by cooling the cold side of the TEG through the use of radiative cooling materials. High thermal conductivity of a DRC material is crucial for transferring the cooling power from the surface to the cold side of the TEG. Nevertheless, the thermal conductivities of advanced DRC materials developed in recent years have generally been very low (e.g., silica–polymer composite films,29 silica–polymer composite fibers,26 polymer-coated metals,27 polymer-coated silica,45 porous polymer coatings,46 and wood25). Although polymer-based DRC materials have high thermal emittances in the mid-infrared (MIR; λ = 4–25 μm), the low thermal conductivity of such DRC materials can lead to a significant thermal resistance between the cold side of the TEG and the surface of the DRC materials. To efficiently exchange energy between a TEG and outer space, it will be necessary to discover materials having both great DRC ability and good thermal conductivity. Ceramic-based materials appear to have the greatest potential for constructing highly thermally conductive DRC materials. Some ceramic-based DRC materials, including SiO2, Al2O3, and BaSO4, have sufficiently wide band gaps (Eg > 4 eV) and feature Reststrahlen bands in the MIR, leading to high thermal emissivity.47 Nevertheless, the thermal conductivities of most studied ceramic DRC materials are generally less than 102 W m−1 K−1. For this present study, we chose hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as a potential candidate to develop a DRC structure having high thermal conductivity. h-BN is a wide-band-gap material (Eg = ca. 6 eV) that possesses outstanding thermal conductivity (ca. 400 W m−1 K−1) in the basal plane;48 it is one of the most thermally conductive ceramic materials.49 Furthermore, the strong optical phonon modes of h-BN provide high thermal emittance in the MIR regime.
We developed an h-BN-based DRC material to significantly enhance the performance of the TEG. While most studies in recent years have focused on improving the performance of thermoelectric materials, here we aimed to provide an efficient alternative route for a TEG to recover near-ambient waste heat. We constructed efficient near-ambient thermoelectric devices, combining a DRC and a commercial TEG, for energy harvesting—during both the daytime and nighttime—of near-room-temperature waste heat at temperatures in the range of 35–60 °C. Without using polymer-based DRC materials, we obtained highly thermally conductive ceramic DRC materials possessing extremely low solar absorption (ca. 5%) and approximately 90% broadband thermal IR emittance. By combining the daytime radiative cooler with a commercial TEG, we achieved great thermoelectric power enhancements in both the daytime and nighttime.
Results and discussion
Characterization of radiative cooling ability in near-room-temperature WHR
The principle of near-room-temperature WHR requires an efficient means of draining heat energy from the waste heat source when only a small temperature difference exists with the surroundings. A TEG is a potential candidate for near-room-temperature WHR because of its compact size and good reliability. In this study, DRC had great potential to decrease the temperature of the cold side and increase the temperature difference between the cold and hot sides of the TEG. Fig. 1(a) displays a schematic representation of the TEG cooperating with DRC. Common near-room-temperature waste heat sources, including air conditioners, heat engines, and the human body, operate at temperatures between 30 and 60 °C.1 In this temperature range, radiative heat exchange between the cold side and the surroundings is crucial. Nevertheless, the optical properties of commercial TEG chips are characterized by high solar absorption and middle emissivity in the sky window (λ = 8–13 μm). The optical properties of the TEG chips could not, therefore, achieve the conditions of DRC, which requires high solar reflectance and high emissivity in the sky window. Fig. 1(b) presents the emittance and absorptance spectra of the commercial TEG. To verify the importance of radiative heat exchange on the cold side of the TEG in near-room-temperature WHR, we calculated the net heat exchange (Pnet) of the TEG, a broadband absorber, and a narrowband absorber. An ideal broadband absorber would display zero solar absorption and unity emissivity for wavelengths greater than 4 μm. An ideal narrowband absorber would display unity emissivity in the sky window (8–13 μm) and no absorption from the solar spectrum. Fig. 1(b) provides the spectra of two kinds of IR absorbers. We define the net heat exchange (Pnet) with the ambient in the system as follows:Pnet = Prad − Patm + Pcon − Psunwhere Prad is the thermal radiation from the system, Patm is the thermal radiation absorbed from the atmosphere, Pcon [equal to h(Tsurf − Tamb)] is the heat exchange through conduction/convection, h is the conductive/convective heat exchange coefficient, Tamb is the temperature of the ambient, Tsurf is the temperature on the surface between the ambient and the system, and Psun is the absorbed solar power. Details of the calculation are provided in ESI S1.†Fig. 1(c) presents the calculated values of Pnet. We assumed values of Tamb and h of 27 °C and 20 W m−2 K−1, respectively. The values of Pnet of the broadband absorber were higher than those of the narrowband absorber for values of Tsurf greater than Tamb. Furthermore, the difference between the values of Pnet of the broadband and narrowband absorbers increased as the value of Tsurf increased. A broadband absorber can generate more cooling power at the surface. On the other hand, the value of Pnet of the bare TEG was negative for values of Tsurf of less than 44.3 °C (i.e., Tsurf − Tamb < 17.3 °C). A negative value of Pnet for the TEG would indicate that a net energy flux entered the system (i.e., heating the system), with the absorption of solar light mainly contributing to the negative value. To further characterize the radiative heat dissipation ability of the broadband absorber close to room temperature, we calculated the radiative heat exchange (Pradiative = Prad − Patm) and the value of Pcon at the surface of the broadband absorber. Fig. 1(d) reveals that the value of Pradiative was positive (125 W m−2) when Tsurface was equal to Tamb at 27 °C—a situation usually defined as the radiative cooling power (Pcooling). In addition, when the values of Tsurface and Tamb were equal, the value of Pcon became zero. The conductive/convective heat transfer could not provide efficient heat dissipation if the value of Tsurface was close to that of Tamb (i.e., at close to room temperature). Radiative cooling is the only way to induce heat dissipation under near-room-temperature conditions. To verify the importance of radiative heat dissipation, we calculated the ratio between Pradiative and Pnet, defined as ηrad. In Fig. 1(e), we calculated ηrad under various values of h from 5 to 20 W m−2 K−1. This range of h can stand for various situations outdoors.50–54Fig. 1(e) reveals that the value of ηrad was equal to 1 when the temperature difference (Tsurf − Tamb) was zero, meaning that all of the dissipated heat was contributed by Pradiative. The value of ηrad decreased upon increasing the temperature difference for each value of h. The value of ηrad became much higher upon decreasing the value of h. When h was equal to 5 W m−2 K−1, the value of ηrad was greater than 0.69 for temperature differences ranging from 0 to 30 °C. In addition, even in an open environment with significant conductive/convective heat exchange (h = 20 W m−2 K−1), the value of ηrad was greater than 0.361 for temperature differences ranging from 0 to 30 °C. Furthermore, when h was equal to 20 W m−1 K−1, the value of ηrad was 0.7054 when the temperature difference was 3 °C. The contribution of Pradiative accounted for most of the dissipated heat on the cold side of the TEG and had a crucial impact on the performance of the TEG when harvesting energy from near-room-temperature waste heat sources.

Dependence of near-ambient WHR on the heat conductivity of cooling materials
In past studies of DRC, the thermal conductivity (κ) of DRC materials has generally been ignored when calculating the equilibrium temperature and cooling power. Nevertheless, the heat transfer coefficients have crucial effects on near-ambient WHR. A low thermal conductivity can hinder DRC materials from lowering the temperature of the cold side of the TEG. To further characterize the system of the TEG cooperating with DRC, we used a one-dimensional (1D) heat transfer model to calculate the temperature distribution in this system.65 Fig. S3† provides a schematic representation of the heat transfer model. We assumed a constant temperature of the waste heat source (Tw) as the boundary condition; Th is the temperature of the hot side of the TEG, Tc is the temperature of its cold side, and Tcooler is the surface temperature of the cooler. Details of the calculation are provided in ESI S2.† To visualize this 1D heat transfer model, we assumed that the thermal conductivity of the cooler (κcooler) was 10 W−1 K−1 and that the heat waste source had a constant temperature of 40 °C. We then calculated the temperature differences between the hot and cold sides (ΔT = Thot − Tcold) for broadband and narrowband absorbers at various values of Tw. Fig. 2(b) reveals that the value of ΔT of the broadband absorber was higher than that of the narrowband absorber for values of Tw greater than 24.5 °C. At a value of Tw of 40 °C, the broadband and narrowband absorbers provided values of ΔT of 3.36 and 3.01 °C, respectively. Thus, the broadband absorber could emit more thermal radiation to the atmosphere and generate a higher temperature difference. Furthermore, the value of ΔT of the bare TEG was positive (Thot > Tcold) only if the value of Tw was greater than 44.4 °C. The solar absorptance of the bare TEG during the daytime resulted in the value of Tcold being higher than that of Thot when the value of Tw was near ambient temperature (27 °C). Hence, the TEG without DRC ability could not recover waste heat efficiently from the waste heat source at close to room temperature. In addition, the broadband absorber provided a value of ΔT of 0.88 °C even when the values of Tw and Tamb were equal (27 °C). The calculations indicate the potential of a broadband absorber for generating thermoelectric energy under sub-ambient-temperature conditions. As stated above, we conclude that the DRC ability of the TEG system would play a key role, and that an optical spectrum with broadband thermal emission would be more suitable than a narrowband emission for near-room-temperature WHR. To verify the importance of the thermal conductivity of DRC materials, we further calculated the values of ΔT of the TEG cooperating with DRC for various values of κcooler [Fig. 2(c)]. The value of ΔT increased upon increasing the value of κcooler, but reached a saturated value when κcooler was greater than 3 W m−1 K−1. Nevertheless, common materials displaying outstanding DRC ability, including porous polymers, wood, and silica–polymer composite films,29,66,67 usually have very low thermal conductivities (<1 W m−1 K−1), thereby hindering the possible cooling power from thermal radiation and convective/conduction.

(d) Calculated thermoelectric power generated by the TEG with the broadband absorber, while assuming different values of κbulk; solid lines: thermoelectric power calculated for various porosities; scatter points: thermoelectric power calculated by assuming the values of κcooler to be those listed in Table 1; the absorptance spectrum was considered to be that of the broadband absorber. 
In this study we attempted to develop DRC materials possessing good heat transfer properties to increase the heat exchange efficiency. Nanometer- to micrometer-sized pores have usually been added to polymer matrices to increase their solar reflection and, thereby, increase their DRC ability; their porosity has generally been in the range 50–99.5%.46,64,67 With the low thermal conductivity of polymer-based materials (κ < 1 W m−1 K−1), the air pores further decrease the thermal conductivity to less than 0.25 W m−1 K−1. We can, however, decreased the thermal resistance effect of porosity by using highly thermally conductive matrix materials. To verify that a trade-off exists between porosity and thermal conductivity, we calculated the thermoelectric power of DRC cooperating with a TEG for matrices of various thermal conductivities (κbulk) and porosities. We used the effective medium approximation developed by Sahimi66 to estimate the effective thermal conductivities of a binary system under varied porosity:  where κair and κbulk are the thermal conductivities of air (κair = 0.0259 W m−1 K−1) and the DRC material, respectively; κe is the effective thermal conductivity; f1 is the porosity. The different shaded solid lines in Fig. 2(d) represent the calculated amounts of thermoelectric power for the various porosities. At the same value of κbulk, the thermoelectric power gradually decreased upon increasing the porosity. For values of κbulk greater than 50 W m−1 K−1, however, a porosity of approximately 60% did not affect the thermoelectric power significantly (loss of only ca. 1% of thermoelectric power when compared with the case of extremely high thermal conductivity). Moreover, for values of κbulk of less than 1 W m−1 K−1, a porosity of approximately 60% would decrease the thermoelectric power significantly, with a loss of approximately 45% of the thermoelectric power in the case of extremely high thermal conductivity. Hence, high thermal conductivity of the matrix material was key to obtaining superior thermoelectric power output. We also calculated the thermoelectric power of common porous DRC materials [Fig. 2(d)]; Table 1 lists the thermal conductivities used in the calculations. To increase the thermoelectric power of the TEG cooperating with DRC, matrix materials of high thermal conductivity and a small degree of porosity would be preferred. In this study we chose ZnO and h-BN as candidate materials, because of their high thermal conductivities and great DRC abilities. The thermal conductivities of bulk ZnO and h-BN are approximately 135 and 400 (in-plane) W m−1 K−1, respectively. With their high values of κ relative to polymer-based materials, the calculated thermoelectric powers of ZnO and h-BN were nearly 10 times greater than the calculated thermoelectric power of SiO2 aerosol (k = 0.028 W m−1 K−1). High thermal conductivities are essential when designing TEG-assisted DRC techniques for near-room-temperature WHR.

Optical characterization of the micro–nano h-BN/ZnO composite
In the previous section, we noted that a broadband absorber could emit more cooling power and generate more thermoelectric power when a TEG is designed with DRC materials. To achieve a broadband absorber capable of maintaining high thermal conductivity, we selected h-BN as a suitable candidate possessing high thermal conductivity and strong phonon resonance in the MIR range. The anisotropic Reststrahlen bands of h-BN are located in the ranges of λ of 6–7.2 μm (in-plane direction) and 11.8–13.2 μm (out-of-plane direction), values that would be beneficial for achieving high thermal emissivity [Fig. S4(b)].† Nevertheless, the IR absorption properties of h-BN cannot fulfill the requirements of a broadband thermal emitter. Another material that could compensate for the absorption band of h-BN would be necessary. ZnO possesses high thermal emissivity in the MIR region, low solar absorption, and moderate thermal conductivity (k = ca. 135 W m−1 K−1). The highly damped photon–phonon interaction in the Reststrahlen band of ZnO (λ = 16.8–24.5 μm) results in its broadband absorption in the MIR region.68
For this study, we used a hierarchical micro-nano h-BN/ZnO composite (MNHZC) to realize highly thermally conductive materials displaying superior DRC ability. Fig. 3(a) provides a schematic representation of the hierarchical MNHZC, which we fabricated through powder pressing and calcination in an atmospheric environment (see the ESI Methods).† Although the phonon resonances of h-BN and ZnO are in the MIR, their Fresnel reflection losses are high at the Reststrahlen bands for planar surfaces [Fig. S4(c)].† To obtain a broadband absorber, three-dimensional (3D) sub-wavelength structures would be essential for activating the localized surface phonon polaritons (LSPhPs). Therefore, to achieve a broadband absorber in the MIR range, we combined h-BN flakes of micrometer lateral size (d50 = 6 μm) with nano-ZnO powder (d50 = 126 nm). Fig. 3(b) displays the size distributions of the micro h-BN and nano-ZnO materials. Because of their graphitic structure, the micro h-BN flakes had large lateral sizes (1–10 μm) and relatively small thickness (0.1–0.3 μm) (ESI S5).† After mixing the micro h-BN and nano-ZnO materials, the micro h-BN flakes formed a 3D hierarchical structure to activate the LSPhPs of the nano-ZnO powder. ESI S5† reveals that the nano-ZnO powder formed a thin layer on the h-BN flake during the sintering process at 900 °C. The micrometer-sized h-BN provided a 3D structure to excite the LSPhPs of the nano-ZnO. To elucidate the optical properties of the MNHZC, we performed finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations to verify that interactions occurred between the micro-h-BN and nano-ZnO, using a total-field scattered-field source (ESI S6).† We assumed a ZnO-coated h-BN plate to simulate the behavior of the MNHZC. We used the simulated absorption (Cabs) and scattering (Csca) cross-sections to calculate the single scattering albedo [σ = Csca/(Cabs + Csca)]. With the hierarchical structure of the MNHZC, the single scattering albedo at wavelengths ranging from 17 to 25 μm could be decreased greatly, as indicated by the light transportation in the MNHZC being dominated by the absorption. Hence, the MNHZC exhibited high absorption and thermal emission ability in the wavelength regime of 17–25 μm. Fig. 3(c) presents the measured reflectance and absorptance of the sintered ZnO, sintered h-BN, and MNZHC. The reflectance of the sintered ZnO showed was high (40–60%) at wavelengths of 17–25 μm, due to the strong Reststrahlen bands of ZnO (ESI S3).† To overcome the reflection loss, the MNHZC provided a 3D hierarchical structure to excite the LSPhPs of ZnO at wavelengths in the range 17–25 μm. With the assistance of the micro–nano hybrid structures, the absorptance and thermal emission at these wavelengths were enhanced to greater than 90%. On the other hand, the sintered h-BN exhibited a small reflection peak at 6.6 μm and a small reflection shoulder at 9.7 μm. These reflection losses were caused by the planar structure of the micro-sized h-BN flakes. We used the FDTD to simulate the scattering cross-sections of micro h-BN flakes (ESI S7).† The scattering cross-sections of micro h-BN flakes of various sizes revealed that the scattering losses at 8–12 μm were due to no absorption of the h-BN flakes in this wavelength range (ESI S3).† With the assistance of nano-ZnO, however, the MNHZC exhibited lower reflectance at wavelengths of 8–12 μm. Because of the highly damped Reststrahlen bands of ZnO, the extinction coefficient of ZnO remained at approximately 0.04–0.05 in this wavelength range and it could eliminate the reflection losses caused by h-BN. This behavior was also observed from the simulated single scattering albedo (ESI S6).† Therefore, the average absorptance of the MNHZC could be enhanced to approximately 90% at wavelengths ranging from 8 to 25 μm.

(f) Values of Psun (UV), Psun (Vis), and Psun (NIR), calculated for the wavelength regimes 250–400, 400–800, and 800–2500 nm, respectively. 
To verify the radiative cooling ability of the MNHZC, we calculated the radiative heat exchange (Pradiative = Prad − Patm) of the MNHZC, ZnO, h-BN, and TEG from their experimentally measured absorptances. Fig. 3(d) reveals that the MHNZC provided the highest values of Pradiative, with the difference in the values of Pradiative increasing upon increasing the temperature. The higher value of Pradiative indicates that the MHNZC could dissipate more heat while cooperating with the TEG to perform near-room-temperature WHR. The inset to Fig. 3(d) displays the differences in the values of Pradiative between the MNHZC and bare TEG; for example, at 70 °C, the difference was 50 W m−2. In addition to its better absorption in the MIR range, the MNHZC also displayed very low solar absorption. To further verify the impact on the cooling performance, we also calculated the Pnet of the MNHZC and compared with the broadband absorber with various degrees of solar absorption in ESI S4.†Fig. 3(e) presents the solar reflectances of the sintered ZnO, sintered h-BN, and MNHZC. Because of the high melting point of h-BN, its sintering should be performed at a higher temperature than those of the other two samples. We conducted the sintering of h-BN at a temperature of 1050 °C for 2 hours to increase the degree of densification between the powders in the atmospheric environment. The sintered h-BN exhibited high solar reflectance and very low UV absorption, due to the high band gap of h-BN. Nevertheless, the higher sintering temperature would induce the oxidation of h-BN and lead to the formation of B2O3. Indeed, ATR-FTIR and solar reflectance spectra revealed the existence of B2O3 after sintering (ESI S8).† The presence of B2O3 induced a strong absorption band in the NIR region [Fig. 3(e)]. On the other hand, the sintered ZnO exhibited strong reflectance from the visible to the NIR (average reflectance: ca. 96%). Nevertheless, the UV absorption of ZnO was strong, due to its low band gap (Eg = ca. 3.4 eV). Compared with the other two samples, the MNHZC exhibited comprehensively better solar reflectance. In the NIR range, the reflectance of the MNZHC was much higher than that of h-BN, due to the lower sintering temperature of the MNHZC (900 °C) decreasing the degree of oxidation of h-BN. During the sintering of the MNHZC, the nano-ZnO powder acted as a sintering additive that helped the densification of the MNZHC; hence, the temperature of the sintering process was lower than that of pure h-BN. The oxidation of h-BN was strongly inhibited when sintering at 900 °C, such that the absorption from B2O3 in the NIR regime had decreased. Furthermore, because of the high refractive index of h-BN (n = ca. 2.5 at a wavelength of 350 nm) and the hierarchical structure of the MNHZC, the UV absorptance was much lower than that of the sintered ZnO. Fig. 3(f) displays the absorbed solar intensity (Psun) under 1-sun illumination. We classified the amounts of absorbed solar power according to the wavelength ranges: PUV,sun (λ = 260–400 nm), PVis,sun (λ = 400–800 nm), and PNIR,sun (λ = 800–2500 nm). The sintered ZnO exhibited the highest value of PUV,sun, while the sintered h-BN had the highest value of PNIR,sun. Among these materials, the MNHZC had the lowest value of Psun (47.8 W m−2). The significant decrease in the value of PUV,sun was due to the high refraction index of the interface provided by the micro h-BN in the UV range. The hierarchical structure of the MNHZC resulted in its best performance over the whole solar regime.
Measurement of the cooling power of the MNHZC
To verify the radiative cooling ability of the MNHZC, we measured its radiative cooling power in both the daytime and nighttime. Fig. 4(a) provides a schematic representation of the experimental setup. We used an acrylic box filled with Styrofoam to minimize heat transfer through conduction and convection; radiation shields positioned at an angle of 45° to prevent incoming ground thermal radiation; a polyethylene (PE) windshield to minimize conduction and convection effects while maintaining transparency between the MNHZC and the sky; a polyimide (PI) heater to provide the power flux to maintain the temperature of the MNHZC (Tsample) equal to the temperature of the surrounding (Tsurrounding) inside the acrylic box. The ambient temperature (Tamb) was recorded by a thermocouple positioned in a well-shaded outdoor place to prevent direct heating from the sun. Details of the experimental setup are provided in the ESI Methods section.†Fig. 4(b) and (d) present the measured data—including the cooling power, solar irradiance, wind speed, and ambient temperature—recorded in the daytime and nighttime, respectively. The wind speeds during the daytime and nighttime were less than 1 m s−1, guaranteeing low heat transfer through conduction and convection. The solar irradiance was approximately 900 W m−2 during the daytime and zero in the nighttime. Fig. 4(c) and (e) display the measured values of Tsample and Tsurrounding, respectively. The temperature difference between Tsample and Tsurrounding (ΔT) was minimized to eliminate the effect of conduction and convection between the sample and its surroundings. Hence, the measured cooling power was contributed primarily by thermal radiation heat exchange between the MNHZC and the sky. Fig. 4(b) reveals that the average radiative cooling power during the daytime was 160.2 W m−2, comparable with the theoretical value (160.9 W m−2). The radiative cooling power provided by the MNHZC resulted in efficient heat dissipation. Moreover, the average radiative cooling power at nighttime was 74.2 W m−2. This decrease in radiative cooling power was due to increased humidity and the lower surrounding temperature. A detailed explanation of the calculation of the radiative cooling power is provided in ESI S9.† The stable and consistent radiative cooling power of the MNHZC suggests its potential to facilitate efficient heat dissipation and to cool down the cold side while cooperating with TEG devices.

(b and d) Environmental parameters and cooling power measured in the (b) daytime and (d) nighttime; measured averaged cooling power: 160.2 W m−2 in the daytime, 74.2 W m−2 in the nighttime. (c and e) Values of Tsample and Tsurrounding measured in the (c) daytime and (e) nighttime; the temperature difference was less than 0.1 °C during these measurements. 
Characterization of the DRC-assisted TEG for near-ambient WHR
Having characterized the radiative cooling power of the MNHZC, we measured the thermoelectric power of a TEG cooperating with the MNHZC during the daytime and nighttime. Fig. 5(a) displays the experimental setup. We used a copper plate attached to a PI heater to play the role of a near-room-temperature waste heat source. The temperature of the PI heater was maintained at 40 °C (ESI Methods).† We tested the cooling ability of the radiative cooler by measuring the thermoelectric power generated by a TEG placed on the PI heater. To verify the importance of the DRC ability and thermal conductivity in such a scenario, we employed two controls: (1) a TEG cooperating with a powder-sintered PVDF radiative cooler (PVDF/TEG) and (2) a bare TEG. Powder-sintered PVDF is an efficient radiative cooler, but its low thermal conductivity would hinder the radiative cooling from cooling the cold side of the TEG. The absorptance/emittance spectra and calculated cooling performance of the powder-sintered PVDF are provided in ESI S10.†Fig. 5(c) and (d) present the environmental data recorded in the daytime and nighttime, respectively. The solar irradiance in the daytime was approximately 750 W m−2; the ambient temperature was approximately 28 °C and the wind speed was less than 2 m s−1. To simulate an outdoor near-room-temperature waste heat source, we removed the PE windshield. Fig. 5(e) displays the thermoelectric power measured in the daytime. The MNHZC/TEG system delivered the highest thermoelectric power; the average from 12:30 to 14:00 was 225.3 mW m−2. The average amounts of thermoelectric power for the PVDF/TEG and bare TEG systems were 80.0 and 20.0 mW m−2, respectively. Although it featured the good DRC ability of PVDF, the PVDF/TEG system provided only moderate thermoelectric power, due to the low thermal conductivity. The superior thermoelectric power generated by the MNHZC/TEG system arose from both the DRC ability and high thermal conductivity of the MNHZC. The measured thermal conductivity of the MNHZC was much higher (κ = 3.5 W m−1 K−1) than that of the powder-sintered PVDF (κ = 0.18 W m−1 K−1) (ESI S11).† The high thermal conductivity of the MNHZC greatly enhanced the amount of thermoelectric power. In the daytime, the DRC ability and high thermal conductivity of the MNHZC enhanced the amount of thermoelectric power by approximately 1030% relative to that of the bare TEG, whereas the powder-sintered PVDF improved it by only approximately 300% [Fig. 5(b)]. Furthermore, the MNHZC also enhanced the amount of thermoelectric power in the nighttime [Fig. 5(f)], with the MNHZC/TEG system again providing the highest amount. The average amounts of thermoelectric power provided by the MNHZC/TEG, PVDF/TEG, and bare TEG were 412.3, 189.0, and 143.2 mW m−2, respectively. Because of the absence of light from the sun and the lower ambient temperature [Fig. 5(d)], the amount of thermoelectric power generated in the nighttime was greater than that generated in the daytime. Nevertheless, the MNHZC/TEG system again provided an enhancement of approximately 190% relative to that of the bare TEG, whereas the PVDG/TEG system exhibited an enhancement of only approximately 30% [Fig. 5(b)]. Although PVDF had great DRC ability, its thermal resistance significantly hindered the radiative cooling power, thereby generating thermoelectric power only to a degree comparable with that of the bare TEG.

Near-room temperature waste heat recovery
To demonstrate the ability of the MNHZC to generate thermoelectric power in the presence of various types of heat sources, we measured the amounts of thermoelectric power generated at temperatures of the waste heat source (Tw) ranging from 35 to 60 °C in the daytime. Fig. 6(a) reveals that the thermoelectric power increased upon increasing the value of Tw, with the power generation ability of the MNHZC/TEG system being superior to those of the PVDF/TEG and bare TEG systems. The amount of generated thermoelectric power reached 1842.3 mW m−2 at a value of Tw of 60 °C; this amount was approximately six times greater than that generated using the bare TEG. Thus, the MNHZC has considerable potential to recover waste heat in different temperature ranges.

(b) Comparison of the thermoelectric power generated by recently developed TEG systems cooperating with DRC, in the (top) daytime and (bottom) nighttime; the measured thermoelectric powers are presented at values of Th of 35 and 40 °C. 
Having demonstrated the waste heat recovery ability of the MNHZC, we compared its performance with that of other recently developed radiative coolers cooperating with a TEG. A detailed comparison is provided in Table 2. The amount of thermoelectric power generated by the thermally conductive MNHZC was superior to that of the polymer-based DRC coolers when the value of Tw was 35 °C, the typical temperature of human skin [Fig. 6(b)].42,69–72 Furthermore, the thermoelectric power generated by the MNHZC/TEG system was 116.4 W m−2 at a value of Tw of 35 °C. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate amounts of generated thermoelectric power of greater than 100 W m−2 in the daytime and greater than 200 W m−2 in the nighttime when the temperature of the waste heat source was the same as the temperature of human skin.

Conclusion
We have elucidated the importance of thermal conductivity in TEG systems cooperating with DRC materials. A highly thermally conductive DRC material is essential for ensuring near-room-temperature WHR. Highly thermally conductive ceramics are suitable for increasing the temperature difference between the hot and cold sides of the TEG. For this study, we chose ionic ceramics h-BN and ZnO because of their high thermal conductivities and Reststrahlen bands in the MIR range. The low degrees of solar absorption of h-BN and ZnO were also essential for achieving DRC requirements. Furthermore, we fabricated daytime radiative materials having hierarchical structures composed of micro h-BN and nano-ZnO. The compensative absorption properties of h-BN and ZnO allowed us to fabricate an ideal broadband absorber. The microstructure provided by the micro h-BN activated the LSPhPs of the nano-ZnO and increased the absorption of the MNZHC in the MIR region. The MNHZC offered excellent solar reflectivity (95.2%) and a thermal emittance of 90% in the MIR region. We tested the cooling ability of the MNHZC by measuring the cooling power and thermoelectric power when the MNHZC cooperated with the TEG during both the daytime and nighttime. The MNHZC provided outstanding cooling power (160.2 W m−2). Furthermore, the thermoelectric power generated by our MNHZC/TEG system is the highest among those of other recently developed systems. The MNHZC/TEG system provided a thermoelectric power of 225.3 mW m−2 in the daytime and 412.3 mW m−2 at night—enhancements of 1030 and 190% when compared with those provided by the bare TEG in the daytime and nighttime, respectively. The MNHZC/TEG system provides a new means of consistently generating power in both the daytime and nighttime. We verified that the low thermal conductivity of porous polymers would hinder the radiative cooling ability to cool the cold side of the TEG. The conventional design of a polymer-based DRC cooler could not achieve high thermal conductivity. Although the MNHZC could achieve near-room-temperature WHR, our strategy would not be limited to using only a near-room-temperature source. The MNHZC/TEG system also displayed great ability to generate electricity at higher temperatures. At a heat source temperature of 60 °C, the amounts of thermoelectric power generated by the MNHZC/TEG system were 2352 and 1842 mW m−2 in the nighttime and daytime, respectively. The attractive power generation ability of the MNHZC/TEG system suggests its great potential for low-grade waste heat recovery and environmental energy harvesting, consistently generating power during both the daytime and the nighttime.
