    , Accepted 16th December 2019First published on 18th December 2019AbstractLuminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) are a promising solution to reduce the cost of integrated photovoltaic (PV) cells. Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) have been shown to be excellent candidates as a new type of absorber/emitter in LSCs, due to their size-tunable absorption and emission, high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and structure-engineered large Stokes shift. However, to date, the majority of QD-based LSCs employ QDs containing heavy-metal (e.g. Cd or Pb) elements, which limits the potential commercialization of LSCs. Herein, we propose the synthesis of green transition metal ion-doped semiconductor QDs such as Cu-doped ZnInSe QDs and their use as luminophores in LSCs. By tailoring the amount of Cu doping, it was possible to tune the photoluminescent (PL) emissions over the whole visible spectral window and simultaneously enlarge the Stokes shift, reaching a PLQY of 63%. Furthermore, a comparative study between polymer and liquid solar concentrators showed that, under optimal conditions, it is possible to obtain a green, heavy metal free liquid QD-based LSC with a high optical efficiency of over 3.5%. This result is more than two times higher than that of a polymer LSC (ηopt = 1.75%, G = 10), which could be ascribed to the reduced reabsorption losses and avoided energy loss by surface and internal defects resulting from polymerization. The waveguides for liquid LSCs could be recycled for tuning the concentrations and changing various luminophores which makes the liquid LSCs cost-effective and environmentally friendly. The success of eco-friendly Cu doped Zn–In–Se QDs for liquid LSCs provides a platform of more efficient and environmentally friendly solar energy harvest systems. In addition, the comparative study between liquid and polymer waveguides provides an opportunity to optimize LSC performance.
1. Introduction
Solar technologies are being increasingly explored due to their potential for low cost power generation.1–6 Among various emerging technologies, luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) are promising for reducing the cost of integrated photovoltaic (PV) systems by using a smaller solar cell module. In general, a LSC is made of a transparent matrix (polymer, glass, etc.) containing the luminophores, such as organic dyes or inorganic quantum dots (QDs), which absorb the sunlight and reemit it at longer wavelengths. The re-emitted photons are confined within the matrix due to total internal reflection (TIR) and are concentrated on the edges of the LSC and harvested by an integrated PV cell.7 However, different energy losses during the concentration process hinder the performance of LSCs, including reflection and scattering losses of the waveguides,8 narrow absorption bands,9 low PLQYs,10 and reabsorption of reemitted light (due to the small Stokes shift of the luminophore).11,12 Thus, to realize a highly efficient LSC, the selection of optically active luminophores and host matrices plays a substantial role.
In the early research stages of LSCs, the common and widely used optically active centers were organic fluorescent dyes (such as coumarin) which possess a very high PLQY but a narrow absorption spectrum and small Stokes shift, leading to low efficiency LSCs.9 Over the past decade, inorganic QDs used in LSCs have shown great promises due to their relatively high PLQY, broad absorption and tunable emission spectrum (from UV to the near infrared band (NIR)), adjustable Stokes shift and good chemical/photo-stability. Semiconductor nanoparticles, in particular the ones made of metal chalcogenide (such as CdS,13 CdSe,14 PbS,15 and PbSe16) QDs and their composite heterostructures, including core/shell CdSe/CdS QDs or PbS/CdS QDs, have been used to fabricate LSCs in polymer matrices, yielding excellent optical performance.11,17,18 However, there is a main drawback: such highly efficient QDs contain highly toxic elements (Cd, Pb), which are harmful to the environment and human health and could hinder their use in commercial applications. As alternatives, heavy metal free QDs including non-metal QDs (carbon dots,19,20 silicon dots21,22), and heavy-metal free binary (Ag2S/Se,23 ZnS/Se24) and ternary QDs (CuInS2/Se2,25 AgInS2 (ref. 26)) have been reported for application in LSCs. Among various promising candidates, cadmium-free metal ion doped nanocrystals (NCs) have shown significant potential in LSCs due to their large Stokes shifts and tunability of absorption and emission spectra.27,28 Erickson et al. reported Mn2− doped ZnSe/ZnS QDs with no overlap between absorption and emission spectra, which prevented LSCs’ energy loss from luminescence reabsorption.24 Zhu et al. reported the successful synthesis of Zn and Al co-doped CuInS2 QDs.29 Compared to pure CuInSe QDs, the doped CuInSe QDs exhibited a significantly improved PL intensity, and showed excellent optical properties and performance when they were employed to fabricate LSCs. Among these ternary QDs, eco-friendly Cu doped Zn–In–Se QDs are of particular interest. In fact they possess excellent optical properties, including large Stokes shifts, tunable absorption and emission properties, and a moderate QY (25–30%), which could make them a versatile luminophore for LSCs.30
Besides the optical properties of the embedded luminophores, the waveguide material also plays a significant role in determining the efficiency of an LSC. In general, the host material should satisfy some selection criteria, such as (1) high optical transparency in visible and NIR regions, (2) chemical compatibility with the luminophores, (3) no harm/reduced harm to the optical properties of the luminophores, and (4) high processability for fabricating LSCs.31 So far, the widely used host materials for LSCs are polymers, such as poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA),2,10,32 poly(lauryl methacrylate) (PLMA)33 and so on. For inorganic QD based LSCs, the incorporation of inorganic nanoparticles with organic polymers usually cause phase transfer inducing nanoparticle agglomeration, luminescence quenching and transparency loss of polymer waveguides. For instance, Bomm et al. reported that high concentration of a UV initiator (Darocure® 4265) could reduce the PLQY of QDs in polymer composites of lauryl methacrylate (LMA) and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDM) (P(LMA-co-EGDM)).34 Such a QY drop was also found in PMMA polymer matrices, in which the initiator azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) was used to drive thermal polymerization leading to luminescence quenching in the luminophores.35 In a few studies the use of liquid LSCs based on luminophores dispersed in a liquid medium has been reported.15,36,37 The latter can present some advantages over polymer LSCs, such as no changes in the PLQY of the embedded luminophores, tunable concentration of solutions and easy replacement with various luminophores. The waveguide materials used in liquid LSCs are mainly cheap glass/quartz,37–39 which could be easily recycled for embedding different new luminophores in the liquid medium, thereby reducing the cost of the LSC and increasing its processability. However, in the literature there are only a few papers on QD-based liquid LSCs and there are no studies on how they perform compared to polymer-based LSCs under the same conditions.
Here we report the synthesis of eco-friendly Cu-doped Zn–In–Se (CZISe) QDs and their integration in liquid LSCs. ZISe QDs with different Cu dopant amounts are synthesized by hot injection. By appropriately tuning the amount of the Cu dopant, the formed CZISe QDs manifested red-shifted absorption and emission spectra, with a slightly enhanced QY. By coating the surface of CZISe QDs with a shell of ZnSe, we obtained an improved QY and high photostability. The as-prepared QDs were dispersed in toluene and employed to realize liquid LSCs by using a quartz cell as the waveguide. A comparative study with QD based polymer LSCs was carried out. Benefiting from the polymerization-free fabrication, the QDs in liquid LSCs were protected from possible nanoparticle agglomeration and reduced optical properties. Optical measurements for LSCs were performed by an integrated Si PV cell, and an excellent optical efficiency (ηopt) of 3.67% was obtained for the core–shell CZISe/ZSe QD based liquid LSC (G = 10), a value 2 times higher than that of polymer LSCs (ηopt = 1.75%). The use of Cu-doped green QDs and liquid LSCs are strategies not yet explored and we showed that by optimization of their optical features they can be promising candidates for green LSCs. In particular, our approach allows easy tunability of the performance and transparency/color of the LSC for building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs) and also increases the processability, thanks to the easiness of replacing the luminophore.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Selenium powder (Se, 99.99%), zinc acetate (Zn(Ac)2, 99.99%), indium(III)acetate (In(Ac)3, 99.99% trace metals basis), copper(II) acetate (Cu(Ac)2, 98%), 1-octadecene (ODE), 1-dodecanethiol (DDT), oleylamine (OLA) (technical grade, 70%), lauryl methacrylate, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate and diphenyl(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)phosphine oxide were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Canada. All the reagents were used without further purification.
2.2 Synthesis of Cu doped Zn–In–Se QDs and core–shell QDs
The synthesis of ZISe and CZISe QDs was carried out following modified procedures reported elsewhere.40,41 Briefly, the Se stock solution was prepared by mixing Se powder (55 mg, 0.7 mmol) with OLA (0.5 mL), DDT (0.5 mL) and ODE (6.0 mL) under sonication at room temperature. In a typical synthetic reaction, Cu(Ac)3 (8 mg, 0.04 mmol), Zn(Ac)2 (49 mg, 0.266 mmol), In(Ac)3 (156 mg, 0.534 mmol), DDT (1.0 mL), OLA (1.0 mL) and ODE (5.0 mL) were first added into a 100 mL three-neck flask. After degassing for 20 min by bubbling nitrogen at 100 °C, a clear solution was obtained. The temperature was further raised to 200 °C, and the Se stock solution was injected quickly into the solution. After maintaining the reaction for 25 min at 200 °C, CIZSe QDs were obtained. After high-speed centrifugation, the obtained precipitate was redispersed in toluene for characterization. In the present procedure, ZISe QDs with different Cu dopant amounts (ratio Cu/Zn–In = 0, 5%, 10%, and 15% corresponding to Cu precursors: 0, 0.04 mmol/8 mg, 0.08 mmol/16 mg, 0.12 mmol/24 mg, respectively) in raw materials were prepared by tuning the amount of Cu(Ac)3.
For the synthesis of CZISe with ZnSe shell QDs, Zn(OAc)2 (73 mg, 0.4 mmol) was dissolved in a mixed solution of OLA (1.0 mL), DDT (1.0 mL) and ODE (5.0 mL) at 50 °C, and the mixture was added to the obtained raw solution of CZISe (7 mL) under a nitrogen atmosphere. Subsequently, the Se stock solution with Se powder (0.35 mol, 28 mg) in the mixture of OLA (0.5 mL) and DDT (0.5 mL) was added to the above solution. After heating to 220 °C for 1 min, the final core–shell QDs were collected and purified for further use.
2.3 Fabrication of LSCs
Both liquid waveguide and a polymer matrix were used to embed QDs for LSC measurements. The liquid waveguide apparatus is based on rectangular parallelepiped quartz waveguides (Haoming Quartz Co., Ltd. China) with a width of 20 mm and an inner height of 2 mm but different lengths for various geometry factors (G factor). The QDs with different concentrations up to 1.04 mg mL−1 were injected into quartz waveguides through a small aperture using a syringe, and the liquid LSCs were obtained. For polymer matrix based LSCs, the fabrication followed our previous work.20,42 In a typical procedure, under inert atmosphere conditions, the toluene from a QD solution in a 50 mL flask was pumped away, and a QD slurry was obtained. The monomer lauryl methacrylate (LMA) with 20 wt% cross-linking agent ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDM) and a 0.1 wt% UV initiator (diphenyl(2,4,6-trimethyl benzoyl)phosphine oxide) were mixed by ultrasonic treatment to obtain a clear solution. The obtained mixture (6 mL, LMA:EGDM = 0.8:0.2) was injected into the flask containing the QD slurry. After ultrasound treatment, a homogeneous solution was obtained which was then injected into a mold of two glass slides separated with a 2 mm-thick rubber spacer. The mold was under UV radiation (360 nm) for 2 h.
2.4 Characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was utilized to reveal the morphology of the samples (JEOL 2100F). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was conducted using a Panalytical X-Pert PRO MRD operated at 40 kV and 40 mA with a Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.541 Å) source. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a VG Escalab 220i-XL equipped with an Al Kα source. Elemental analysis was conducted by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) (Thermo Scientific iCAP 6000). XRD spectra were recorded in a 2θ range of 20°–70°. Absorption spectra were acquired on a Cary 5000 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Varian). Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded with a Fluorolog-3 system (Horiba Jobin Yvon). The PL lifetime of the QDs in solution or the polymer was measured using a pulsed laser diode of 636 nm under fast multichannel scaler mode (fast MCS) in the Fluorolog-3 system. The relative PLQY of QDs was calculated using rhodamine 6G as a reference according to the equation:43 (1)where ØQ and Ør are the QYs of QDs in toluene and rhodamine 6G in ethanol (Ør = 97%), respectively. mQ and mr are the gradient values from the linear fitting plot of integrated fluorescence intensity vs. absorption of QDs and the reference, respectively. nQ and nr refer to the refractive indexes of the solvents used for the QDs (nQ = 1.49) and rhodamine 6G (nr = 1.36), respectively.
2.5 Optical evaluation of LSCs
To measure the optical efficiency of the fabricated LSCs, an ABET2000 solar simulator at AM 1.5G was used to provide the incident light with a power density of 100 mW cm−2. Commercial mirrors were pressed on the edge and bottom of the two different LSCs for reflecting the light, just as shown in Fig. 1. Moreover, a Si PV cell (module KXOB22 from IXYS) was laterally coupled to one edge side of the LSC, and the current–voltage curves of the PV cell were measured using a Keysight 2900A SourceMeter when the LSC was under simulated solar light.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of Cu doped Zn–In–Se QDs
ZISe and CZISe QDs were formed by a simultaneous nucleation and growth strategy via hot injection method.44 In this study, the initial ratio of Zn, In and Se precursors was fixed at 1:2:3, while the ratio of Cu to Zn–In precursors was variable. As visible in Fig. 2, the Cu dopant ions play a significant role in tuning the absorption and emission properties of ZISe QDs. Pure ZISe QDs show a limited absorption up to 550 nm and extremely low photoluminescence properties (Fig. S1†). In general, ternary and quaternary alloyed QDs show poorly resolved excitonic absorption and emission features.45,46

Each CZISe sample exhibits a relatively distinct excitonic absorption peak, which may indicate a homogeneous composition and size distribution of the obtained crystals.44,46 Specifically, with the increase of the Cu dopant ratio from 5% to 15%, the absorption onset manifests a red-shift from 620 nm to 680 nm, while the PL emission peak of the samples shifted from 677 nm to 718 nm. As previously reported, the Cu (Cu+ formed in Zn-based nanocrystals) acts as a dopant, which is responsible for the emission from these alloy nanocrystals, while the ratio of the other elements, Zn, In and Se, has a major effect on the absorption band tuning.30 The large full width at half maximum (FWHM) (Table S1†), around 115–123 nm, in CZISe QDs supports the hypothesis that the PL signal originates from the dopant emission, which can be attributed to the recombination of the generated excitons from the ternary host material in the Cu T2 state.9 A similar phenomenon was reported in Cu-doped ZnSe/S.47,48 Moreover, from the spectra in Fig. 2b, a large Stokes shift can be observed, which is possibly due to the multi-excitation recombination behavior in I–III–VI group nanocrystals.26 In general, the Stokes shift is an important parameter to estimate the reabsorption of fabricated LSC devices. However, a more significant parameter, based also on recent studies,49,50 is the integrated overlap (IO) between absorption and PL curves. This parameter is more critical than Stokes shift for correlating the reabsorption losses. Considering that the excitonic absorption peak in such CZISe QDs is not well resolved, three assumed absorption peaks were chosen as the maximum intensity for normalization, as shown in Fig. S2 and Table S2.† From the results, 5% CZISe exhibited the smallest spectral overlap (IO = 1.34) compared to other samples, meaning possibly the lowest reabsorption in LSC application. The PLQY of CZISe QDs with 5%, 10%, and 15% Cu dopant is 22 ± 5%, 25 ± 5%, and 27 ± 5%, respectively (shown in Table S1†). The slight improvement of the PLQY with the Cu dopant further confirms the Cu center originated emission.30,51
Surface passivation by using suitable inorganic materials is an effective strategy to enhance the PLQY and stability of QDs.51 With the perspective of using these QDs as luminophore centers for LSCs, based on the overlap area results and PLQY for all as-prepared samples, 5% CZISe is chosen as the primary core structure to construct core–shell QDs. Due to its relatively wide band gap (Eg = 2.7 eV) and chemical stability, ZnSe was selected as the shell structure.52 After coating the ZnSe shell around the CZISe nanostructure, the PLQY of the obtained 5% CZISe/ZSe reached as high as 63 ± 5% due to the reduced surface defect states for the efficient exciton separation (Table S1†).
To develop a better understanding of the effects of the ZnSe shell on the optical properties of QDs, Fig. 3 reports a comparison of both absorption spectra and PL emission spectra between 5% CZISe and 5% CZISe/ZSe. From the absorption spectra, it is observed that by coating with a ZnSe shell, the band gap of the as-prepared samples increased, which can be attributed to a reduced core diameter, due to the exchange of Cu2+ or In3+ ions with excess Zn2+ during the surface passivation process.53,54 Furthermore, such an ion exchange in ZnSe coated QDs would also lead to a blue shift (Δλ = 33 nm) of the PL emission peak.
 Fig. 3  Absorption and PL spectra of 5% CZISe QDs and 5% CZISe/ZSe QDs. 
TEM and XRD were carried out for structural characterization of the as-prepared QDs, as shown in Fig. S3 and S4.† Fig. S3† illustrates that the resultant NCs are tetrahedral in shape, with the typical 2D-projection shapes of the tetrahedron (triangles and quadrilaterals) marked in red circles. The obtained NCs possess high size uniformity as confirmed by the size distributions reported in the insets of Fig. 4a–d, where the size is defined as the diameter of the circumscribed circle of the projected triangle. The average diameter sizes of the samples are 3.2 ± 0.3 nm, 3.2 ± 0.4 nm, 3.0 ± 0.4 nm, and 3.3 ± 0.2 nm, corresponding to ZISe QDs with Cu dopant ratios of 0, 5%, 10%, and 15%, respectively. The ICP-OES results (Table S3†) reveal that the Cu:Zn–In ratio for all as-prepared samples is close to the one in the initial precursors, indicating successful doping with Cu. In addition, the ratio of Zn and In is very close to the nominal 1:2 (less than 6% changes), and thus the main reason for the PL emission red shift could be assign to the change in the amount of the Cu dopant. After surface passivation on 5% CZISe (Fig. 4e), the obtained NCs maintain a tetrahedral shape, with a size distribution around 3.3 ± 0.4 nm, which does not show an apparent contrast compared to the uncoated NCs due to the ultrasmall size, suggesting that the core shrinks during surface passivation.

Fig. 4f shows the typical XRD patterns of ZISe, CZISe and 5% CZISe/ZSe QDs. The XRD patterns for all samples can be indexed as a tetragonal ZnIn2Se4 crystal (JCPDS no. 39-0458), while no diffraction peaks for Cu impurities can be found in the XRD spectra. Specifically, there is no obvious shift for all the diffraction peaks with the increase of the Cu/(Zn + In) ratio, which can be ascribed to the similar ionic radius of Cu2+ (r = 0.72 Å), Zn2+ ions (r = 0.74 Å) and In3+ (r = 0.81 Å).27,51 In addition, due to the epitaxial growth of ZnSe on CZISe QDs, the final NCs maintain the tetragonal phase, as shown in the XRD pattern in Fig. 4f. To better understand the chemical states of elemental Cu, Zn, and In of the prepared QDs, we performed XPS measurement. No Cu component is detected for the ZISe sample (Fig. S4a†); while for Cu-doped QDs, Cu peaks were found. In particular, the Cu 2p3/2 component around 932.5 eV can be assigned to Cu+, and no Cu2+ signal was detected, indicating that Cu2+ was completely converted into Cu+ during the synthesis process.55 Moreover, the binding energies around 1021.8 eV and 445 eV corresponding to Zn 2p3/2 (Fig. S4b†) and In 3d5/2 (Fig. S4c†) indicate that the chemical states of Zn and In are +2 and +3, respectively. In general, the Cu dopant emission is closely related to the concentration of Cu+ in Zn-based nanocrystals. An increase of the Cu+ dopant concentration can result in a higher excited state leading to a red shift of the PL spectra.56 It has been shown that with the increase of Cu+ concentration, more midgap Cu 3d orbitals are introduced, but the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) remains localized within small clusters of Cu+ ions instead of resembling delocalized Bloch-like bands, which leads to the red-shift of PL emission, just as illustrated in Fig. S5.†57
3.2 Optical evaluations of LSCs
The liquid LSCs were fabricated by using a quartz cell equipped with a small hole (ϕ = 2 mm) for injecting QDs in solution, the details are reported in the Experimental section. In this comparative study, a quartz cell was chosen as the liquid waveguide for a better optical performance. For large-scale applications, quartz can be replaced with common glass due to their low cost and good optical properties for use in LSCs.39,58 However, for real applications, the polymer LSC should be laminated between glass to avoid exposure to weather agents.59,60 The end-costs of polymer and liquid LSCs in mass production, given in Table S4,† show that liquid LSCs cost are slightly higher than polymer LSCs. The estimation of the polymer cost is based on PMMA as it is more commonly used than PLMA in industry. LSCs using inorganic QDs in a liquid medium present different advantages compared to polymer waveguides. For example, while a shift in the emission peak and a drop in the PLQY can be observed when a polymer waveguide is used, these properties are fully preserved in the liquid medium due to the absence of a phase transfer. In liquid LSCs, the optimization of the concentration or changing/comparing different luminophores is more efficient as it avoids the complicated polymerization process for a solid phase. Moreover, possible light scattering sources in polymer materials, such as air bubbles, polymer aggregates, and a rough waveguide surface, can act as defects and reduce the efficiency of large area polymer solar concentrators.
The concentration of QDs has a significant effect on the efficiency of LSCs and on its appearance. In general, higher concentrations will lead to higher absorption but will increase the energy losses due to self-absorption, intermolecular quenching and the possibility of luminophore aggregation.61 On the other hand, too low concentrations will result in insufficient light absorption and emission as well as a low efficiency LSC. Thus, it is important to find the right balance between absorption of light and final performance. For high performance of the liquid LSCs, the concentrations of the as-prepared 5% CZISe and 5% CZISe/ZSe QDs were optimized for the best optical efficiency (see Fig. 5). In general, the optical efficiency (ηopt) of an LSC can be defined as:9 (2)where ILSC refers to the short circuit current from the Si-based PV cell coupled with the LSC, ISC is the short circuit current from the Si-based PV cell under direct illumination, and G is the geometric factor defined as the ratio of the area of the top surface of the LSC (Atop) and the surface area of the edge coupled with a solar cell (Aedge). The liquid LSC was placed under AM 1.5G simulated solar light (100 mW cm−2), and a commercial Si solar cell was attached at one edge of the LSC. The G factor was fixed at 15. As shown in Fig. 5a, it can be seen that the highest optical efficiency (G = 15) of 5% CZISe and 5% CZISe/ZSe QD based liquid LSCs is 2.98% and 3.13%, respectively, corresponding to the optimized concentration of 0.92 mg mL−1 and 0.67 mg mL−1, respectively. With the optimal amount of QDs, the solar-to-electrical power conversion efficiency (PCE) was calculated based on the results of photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of PV and LSC-PV systems, as shown in Fig. 5b. The 5% CZISe and 5% CZISe/ZSe based liquid LSCs deliver the PCEs of 0.79% and 0.83%, respectively. The improved performance of LSCs with surface passivated QDs can be ascribed to the improved PLQY and a reduced self-absorption due to smaller IO.

To illustrate the possible potential of liquid LSCs, a comparison with polymer LSCs was carried out. In general, in literature, polymer based LSCs are the most studied, while there is a lack of research on liquid LSCs and comparison of performances between these two different waveguides. In this study, poly(lauryl methacrylate) (PLMA) was selected as the host polymer matrix due to its high transparency and desirable compatibility with QDs in conventional and large production-scale polymers. Compared to the widely used PMMA, PLMA has the ability to flex and bend, good compatibility with QDs as well as relatively good outdoor stability and rigidity.62 However, the optical properties of QDs might be affected by nanocrystal agglomeration, and the surface irregularities and density variations caused by the complicated polymerization process.31 To decrease the possibility of nanoparticle agglomeration during the polymerization process, we selected the concentratios of C ∼ 0.9 mg mL−1 and 0.6 mg mL−1 for 5% CZISe and 5% CZISe/ZSe, respectively for both quartz and polymer matrices for conducting PL spectral measurement. The PL of QDs is very sensitive to their aggregation, which leads to a red-shift of the PL peak due to the energy transfer between neighbouring nanocrystals. As shown in Fig. 6a and S6,† there is no significant change during the LSC fabrication process, indicating that no obvious QD aggregation occurs at such concentrations in our system. The corresponding PL lifetime decay curves in solution and polymer were obtained to clarify the origin of PL emissions (Fig. 6b). A triple-exponential decay function was used to fit the PL lifetimes; the fitting details are reported in Table S5.† The average lifetime value is of the order of hundreds of nanoseconds (157.7 ns) for 5% CZISe QDs and it is in agreement with literature data, which are associated with dopant center emission in Cu doped nanocrystals.46 After surface passivation, the lifetime of QDs increased from 157.7 ns to 170.6 ns, which could be explained by a lower amount of surface defects deriving from Zn replacing Cu and In vacancies resulting in the suppressed exciton leakage and less non-radiative decay.51 There is no obvious variation in the lifetimes of QDs in solution and those dispersed in the polymer matrix, which is in agreement with the result of unchanged PL emission. PL spectroscopy by considering the variations in lifetime can be used to estimate the relative QYs of QDs in solution and in a polymer matrix according to the consolidated methodology proposed by Klimov et al.2,63
 Fig. 6  Optical measurement of 5% CZISe QDs and 5% CZISe/ZSe QDs in solution and in polymer: (a) PL emission spectra and (b) PL decay curves. 
The QY can be expressed as: (3)where ket and knet are the radiative and the non-radiative decay rate, respectively.
The measured lifetime is equal to: (4)
The polymerization process only affects the knet of QDs.17 The PL dynamics of QDs before (in solution) and after embedding into the polymer exhibit almost no variation in lifetimes (Fig. 6b), indicating that the preparation process (exposure to UV light and initiator radicals for polymerization) does not lead to formation of a significant density of surface-defects/traps, which can highly affect the non-radiative decay rate knet.17 As the measured lifetime (τ) of the investigated QDs does not change after embedding them in the polymer, we can deduce that also the factor (ket + knet) did not change. This is a clear indication that the QDs embedded in the polymer have almost the same QY as in solution.
Eventually, the optical performance of polymer LSCs was measured using the Si PV cell attached at the edge of the LSC, similar to the optical test for liquid LSCs. It has been proved that there is no obvious aggregation of QDs in the polymer matrices with a concentration of C ∼ 0.9 mg mL−1 and 0.6 mg mL−1 for 5% CZISe and 5% CZISe/ZSe, respectively, which were considered to be used in both liquid and polymer LSCs. For a fair comparison of the LSCs, the liquid LSCs and polymer LSCs have the same thickness and lateral size, as illustrated in Fig. 7a. Fig. 7b reports the digital image of the as-fabricated LSCs using 5% CZISe QDs as the optically active center. As it can be seen, when the top surface of LSCs is irradiated with the simulated solar light, a concentrated red light is generated at the edge. From the optical results of LSCs (Fig. 7c and d), the ηopt for all the types of LSCs demonstrates an exponential decrease with the increase of the geometry factor due to the increased scattering loss, a phenomenon commonly reported also in the literature.18 The liquid LSCs always exhibit higher ηopt than polymer LSCs at parity with the G value. In particular, at G = 15, the ηopt of the 5% CZISe based liquid LSC is almost 4 times higher than that of the polymer LSC using the same QDs (ηopt,liquid LSC = 2.63%, ηopt,polymer LSC = 0.70%) (see the detailed photovoltaic parameters in Table S6†). The ηopt of the 5% CZISe/ZSe based liquid LSC reaches up to 3.67% (G = 10), which is over 2 times higher than that of the same-QD based polymer LSC (ηopt = 1.75%, G = 10).

To investigate the effect of different waveguides on the optical efficiency of the LSCs, the surface reflection and energy trapping in the waveguides were taken into consideration. In general, for host waveguides, the refractive index (n) is an important parameter in terms of the surface energy loss, which will affect the surface reflection (R) and energy trapping efficiency (ηtrap). In general, R could be calculated using Fresnel eqn (5):31 (5)where n refers to the refractive index of the waveguides. While the ηtrap can be obtained from eqn (6) based on Snell's law:64 (6)where θc is the critical angle. To optimize the surface energy reflection and energy trapping in the waveguide, the value of (1 − R)ηtrap should be maximized. For liquid LSCs and polymer LSCs in this work, the refractive indexes of quartz and PLMA material are 1.46 and 1.49, respectively.31 The calculated (1 − R)ηtrap under ideal conditions (without local defects) for quartz and PLMA is 0.70 and 0.71, respectively. As these values are comparable, the energy trapping and surface reflection are not the reasons for the improved performance of liquid LSCs. The higher optical performance of the liquid LSC than the polymer waveguide can be mainly attributed to the lower presence of defects and higher uniform compositions in quartz waveguides compared to the polymer in which the presence of local defects, such as air bubbles, polymer agglomeration and rough surface, can cause possible energy losses. To investigate the effect of the polymerization process on the waveguides, PL measurements for liquid and polymer LSCs from different optical paths were conducted. When the laser light (515 nm) was perpendicularly shined at the top surface of the LSC, the PL intensity can be collected at a fixed distance from the edge. The presence of defects in waveguides, and self-absorption of the QDs, will cause a weakening of the emission. The ratio between the integral of the intensities (where I0 is the emission at the furthest distance, in this case at 2 cm) can be used to compare the quality of different waveguides, and the compatibility of the QDs and host material. From the PL results of LSCs obtained at different optical paths (Fig. 7e), the liquid LSCs exhibited better optical performance than polymer LSCs. At a 3.5 cm optical path, the PL integral of liquid LSCs maintained values as high as 0.85 (5% CZISe) and 0.93 (5% CZISe/ZSe) compared to the initial intensity values, which is much higher than that of polymer based LSCs (corresponding to 0.43 and 0.55). The energy losses in the LSC can be due to both reabsorption losses and photon escape cone losses. In the presence of the reabsorption phenomenon, the emitted photons can be absorbed by other QDs. Some of these photons will be lost due to the escape cone. In this case, with the contribution of reabsorption, photon escape losses can also lead to a red-shift and PL spectral distortion.21,63 Without the reabsorption effect, the photon escape cone losses do not lead to any red-shift or PL spectral distortion. The QDs used in this work have a large Stokes shift (small IO), which has led to a very weak resorption effect as proved by the slight PL red-shift and spectral distortion shown in Fig. S7.† Such rapidly decreased PL properties in polymer LSCs can be ascribed to the excess energy loss caused by surface and internal defects from phase transfer. Furthermore, the benefit of the ZnSe shell is visible: the core/shell QD-based waveguides present reduced losses compared to the core QDs, confirming the increased Stokes shift and QY. Polymer LSCs possess a single-layered structure, while liquid LSCs in quartz waveguides exhibit a sandwich-like structure. The difference between such architectures possibly has a great effect on the escape cone loss during total internal reflection. The schematic diagram of energy propagation in liquid and polymer LSCs (Fig. 7f) shows that the QDs in both LSCs absorb the incident light and emit photons. Some of the re-emitted photons were concentrated through total internal reflection to the edge of the LSC and harvested by the PV cell, while a fraction of the re-emitted light is lost through the escape cone. Unlike single-layered polymer LSCs, liquid LSCs possess a sandwich-like structure which would lead to a different total internal reflection. In this case, a fraction of light could be trapped in solution/QDs through total internal reflection and reaches the coupled PV cell due to the different refractive index of the quartz waveguide (1.46) and liquid medium (1.49). In addition, the quartz can slightly increase the absorption of liquid LSCs and reduce the reabsorption loss due to the total internal reflection occurring in pure quartz waveguides, which is similar to reports in the literature.65
The photostability of the luminophores is also another important parameter for LSCs. In particular, the photostability of both polymer and liquid LSCs was also tested under UV radiation with high intensity. The PL emission intensities of LSCs under dark and under UV radiation for 7 h were recorded (see Fig. 8). The 5% CZISe based liquid LSC exhibited poor photostability with a dramatic drop of PL emission intensity (remaining at 19%), while the 5% CZISe/ZSe based LSC performed much better, with a drop of only 47% of the PL emission after 7 h. The improved photostability could be ascribed to the successful ZnSe passivation on the surface of 5% CZISe which reduces the photobleaching of the QDs. In this case the polymer LSCs showed higher photostability than liquid LSCs, which is probably due to the added protection from polymer matrices that protect from the environment. A promising future research direction is to search for highly efficient and photostable QDs for enhanced liquid LSCs.
 Fig. 8  Photostability of the LSCs, PL0 is the initial peak emission integral and PL is the peak emission integral after 7 h of UV irradiation. 
Solvent evaporation is also an important parameter which affects the photostability of liquid LSCs. To test the rate of solvent evaporation, we designed an experiment by placing the liquid LSC device (20 mm × 20 mm × 2 mm) at 50 °C for 4 hours. After 4 hours of heating, the mass loss was 40 mg, which is around 5% (40 mg/715 mg) of the original mass. This loss is due to the small hole with a diameter of 1 mm used for injecting and removing the solvent. We also used tape to seal the small hole and kept the LSC device at 50 °C for 4 hours. In this case the result showed no obvious mass loss. The well-sealed liquid LSCs show good solvent stability under temperature fluctuations.
During the LSC optical test, the mirror and Si solar cell were pressed against the LSC edges. In order to reduce the energy loss, toluene was chosen as the solvent, not only because it is perfectly compatible with QDs, but also because it has a very similar refractive index (1.49) to quartz (1.46) thus reducing energy loss during internal light propagation. In addition, the mirrors were applied at the edge and bottom to allow the incoming light to enter the waveguide and be absorbed, but to be reflective for wavelengths emitted by the luminophore. In this process, optical loss at the boundaries is inevitable due to the existence of air gaps between the interfaces of the LSC and Si solar cell, and the reflector. In this case, a matching fluid test was conducted by adding the toluene between the glass and the solar cell. The results (reported in Table S7†) show that adding the refractive index matching fluid can improve the optical efficiency by 8% in average. The larger variation in the LSC with the matching liquid can be attributed to the difficulty in coupling the toluene on the waveguide. In general, applying matching fluids or glues on the interface of the LSC and Si solar cell, and the reflector on the edge and bottom could be a potential way to reduce the energy losses, which can also be a promising future research direction for highly efficient LSCs.
4. Conclusions and perspectives
In summary, heavy metal free Cu doped Zn–In–Se colloidal QDs were synthesized via the hot injection method. By increasing the amount of Cu doping, the obtained QDs exhibited red-shifted absorption and PL emission spectra, as well as a slightly increased PLQY. After surface passivation treatment, the core–shell QDs (5% CZISe) reached a remarkable value of 63% PLQY. The as-prepared green QDs were applied into a liquid LSC in a quartz waveguide for the first time. At G = 15, the best performance of the liquid LSC filled with 5% CZISe/ZSe core–shell QDs was found with an ηopt of 3.13%, which is higher than that (ηopt = 2.98%) of LSCs with 5% CZISe QDs due to the improved PLQY of core shell QDs. Polymer LSCs were also assembled using 5% CZISe and 5% CZISe/ZSe QDs for comparison. The ηopt (G = 10) of the 5% CZISe/ZSe based liquid LSC reached a remarkable value of 3.67%, and is over two times higher than that of the same-QD based polymer LSC (ηopt = 1.75%). The liquid LSCs with 5% CZISe/ZSe exhibited the best performance in this work, attributed to the increased PLQY with shell passivation, avoided energy loss from phase transfer to the solid state and low reabsorption resulting from the light propagation in the quartz waveguide. In addition, easily variable concentration and replaceable luminophores in the same waveguides make the liquid LSCs recyclable, which could offer a promising pathway to develop sustainable and efficient LSCs for more economical and environmentally friendly PV energy conversion.
