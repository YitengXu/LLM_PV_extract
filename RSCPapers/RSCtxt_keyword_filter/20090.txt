In this study, we present an integrated approach to achieve highly efficient and long-term stable methyl ammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite NW solar cells by combining a 4-(1,3-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)-N,N-diphenylaniline (N-DPBI)-doped poly{[N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalene diimide-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)} (P(NDI2OD-T2)) polymeric film as the electron transport layer (ETL) with an atomic-layer-deposited Al2O3-based film as the encapsulation layer. Our results indicate that N-DPBI doping can not only improve the electron extraction capability by minimizing resistive losses, but also improve the surface coverage of the P(NDI2OD-T2) ETL on the MAPbI3 NW layer. With this n-doped ETL, a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 18.83% is achieved, which represents the highest PCE ever reported for perovskite NW solar cells. Importantly, taking advantage of the high charge carrier mobility of MAPbI3 NWs (0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1), the large-area NW devices with an active area of 5.04 cm2 also deliver a high PCE up to 15.25%. More encouragingly, the encapsulated NW devices exhibit excellent long-term stability, retaining ∼92% of their initial efficiency after being exposed to the ambient atmosphere for more than 6000 hours. The encapsulated NW devices still remain fairly stable (∼20% loss in PCE) even after ∼1500 hours of continuous operation under AM1.5G sunlight irradiation in the ambient atmosphere. The approaches demonstrated herein can not only offer a very promising strategy for realizing high-performance and long-term stable perovskite NW solar cells, but also pave the way for future developments of perovskite NW-based optoelectronic devices.
Introduction
Organometal halide perovskites have emerged as a new and promising class of materials in solar cells.1–7 The rapid increase in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PeSCs) has triggered intensive research to advance the fundamental understanding of the properties of these materials, especially the relationship between the structures and the optoelectronic behaviors.1,3,5,6 It is well known that the charge carrier mobility of the perovskites is an important parameter in determining the efficiency of PeSCs, as it affects the charge recombination dynamics and charge extraction properties.8 However, the perovskite films are shown to suffer from energy losses due, in part, to the undesired charge recombination at the grain boundaries,9,10 which can limit the ultimate photovoltaic performance. One strategy to address this dilemma is to reduce the dimensionality of perovskites. In particular, inspired by the remarkable optoelectronic properties of bulk perovskites, one-dimensional perovskite nanostructures, such as nanowires (NWs) or nanorods, are of particular interest in photovoltaic applications. Owing to their low dimensionality and high surface-to-volume ratio, these nanostructures can potentially have optical and electrical properties superior to their bulk counterparts.11–14 Importantly, these one-dimensional nanostructures are capable of providing more direct charge transport pathways, which can facilitate the efficient transport of photogenerated charge carriers to their respective electrodes without significant recombination losses. However, the obtained device performances based on these one-dimensional nanostructures remain lagging behind those of their thin-film counterparts (with PCE typically in a range of 15–17%),15,16 probably due to inferior contact properties between nanostructured perovskites and adjacent interfacial layers. In addition, the scalability of these nanostructured devices remains highly challenging due, in part, to the lack of a reliable approach for the fabrication of uniform nanostructures over large areas.
Engineering and optimization of the interface between the active layer and the electrode also play an essential role in determining the overall device performance.17–26 An ideal interfacial layer should fulfill the following requirements:17,21 (i) appropriate energy levels to facilitate efficient charge selectivity for corresponding electrodes; (ii) sufficient electrical conductivities to minimize the resistive losses; (iii) excellent film-forming properties to ensure intimate contact with the perovskite layer; (iv) good stability to prevent undesirable reactions. Among the various device architectures, p–i–n type planar heterojunction PeSCs have gained much attention recently due to their low-temperature processability and hysteresis-free characteristics.1,17 Typically, p–i–n type planar heterojunction PeSCs consist of multi-layered hole transport layer (HTL)/perovskite layer/electron transport layer (ETL) thin films sandwiched between an indium-tin-oxide (ITO) substrate and a low-work-function (WF) metal (e.g., Al or Ca). In this type of architecture, materials such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) are generally used as the HTL and ETL, respectively.1,17 Although encouraging device performance is attained in p–i–n type planar heterojunction PeSCs, such devices still suffer from severe stability issues, partly due to insufficient coverage of the perovskite layer by the PC61BM ETL, together with the use of air-sensitive low WF metals.21,24–28 The voids and pinholes present in the PC61BM film act as the pathway for water vapor permeation, which can accelerate the decomposition of the perovskite films. This problem can become more pronounced when employing perovskite nanostructures as the active layer. It is thus highly desirable to develop a new ETL with improved properties to replace fullerenes for achieving high-performance and long-term stable nanostructured PeSCs. Among various non-fullerene acceptors, n-type semiconducting polymers have received significant attention recently owing to their high electron mobility, good stability, and widely tunable optoelectronic properties.29–31 In particular, these polymers generally afford superior film-forming quality, which would be beneficial for applications in nanostructured PeSCs. Despite these advantages, the application of n-type polymeric ETLs in nanostructured PeSCs has not been reported so far. In addition to the development of promising ETL materials, it is generally accepted that PeSCs require reliable thin-film encapsulation to prevent oxygen and moisture ingress into the devices.25–28 However, considerably less effort has been dedicated to developing reliable thin-film encapsulation for PeSCs.
In this work, high-performance and long-term stable methyl ammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite NW solar cells are demonstrated by adopting an integrated approach, which involves: (i) the development of an n-doped polymeric ETL based on a commercially available n-type polymer poly{[N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalene diimide-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)} (P(NDI2OD-T2)); (ii) application of an atomic-layer-deposited (ALD) Al2O3 film (thickness = 50 nm) as the encapsulation layer. We choose an ALD Al2O3 film as the encapsulation layer because it has been proven to provide excellent gas barrier performance, as we have reported previously.25,26 The device structure investigated herein is an ITO-coated glass substrate/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3 NWs/ETL/polyethylenimine (PEI)/Ag cathode/ALD Al2O3 encapsulation layer, as illustrated in Fig. 1a. Our results indicate that the ETL based on P(NDI2OD-T2) shows advantages over the widely used PC61BM in several aspects, such as improved coverage over the perovskite NW surface, superb electron transport properties, and enhanced stability. The perovskite NW solar cells based on P(NDI2OD-T2) deliver a PCE of 13.80%, which is much superior to those of the devices with the PC61BM ETL (PCE = 0.11%). Encouragingly, the performance of the NW devices can be further improved by doping the P(NDI2OD-T2) ETL with air-stable dopant 4-(1,3-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)-N,N-diphenylaniline (N-DPBI; see Fig. 1a for the chemical structure). This n-type doping can not only enhance the electron extraction properties by minimizing resistive losses, but also improve the surface coverage of the P(NDI2OD-T2) ETL on the MAPbI3 NW layer. With these desired properties, the resulting NW devices deliver a remarkable PCE up to 18.83% (with a stabilized PCE of 18.20%), which is higher than those of commonly used devices based on planar MAPbI3 perovskite films. To the best of our knowledge, 18.83% represents the highest PCE value ever reported for perovskite NW solar cells. More importantly, with 50 nm ALD Al2O3 thin-film encapsulation, the NW devices based on the n-doped P(NDI2OD-T2) ETL can exhibit excellent ambient stability, maintaining ∼92% of their initial performance after being stored in ambient air (30 °C, 65% relative humidity (RH)) for more than 6000 hours. The results highlight the importance of employing n-doped interfacial layers and appropriate encapsulation layers in achieving high-performance long-term stable perovskite NW solar cells.

Results and discussion
MAPbI3 NWs are prepared according to literature procedures with slight modification,13,15,16 and more details on the preparation and synthesis of MAPbI3 NWs can be found in the Experimental section. The surface morphology of the MAPbI3 NWs was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), as shown in Fig. 1b–d. These images clearly show an interpenetrating NW morphology. In addition, the large-scale growth of highly uniform MAPbI3 NWs was also demonstrated (Fig. 1e), suggesting their high potential for large scale production. The resulting MAPbI3 NWs were uniform in diameter along the NW length, with average diameters of 170 ± 10 nm and length up to several tens of micrometers (Fig. 1e). The absorption spectra of the MAPbI3 planar film and NWs were then investigated, and the results are depicted in Fig. 2a. Compared to the planar film, NWs exhibited broader light absorption (Fig. 2a), which could be attributed to the reduced light reflection via optical impedance matching and/or increased optical path length of NWs.13,16 The enhanced light absorption properties of the active layer are beneficial for improving the photocurrent generation of photovoltaic devices, as will be discussed below. The charge transport properties of the MAPbI3 planar film and NWs were also examined by measuring the field-effect hole mobility (see the Experimental section for further details). Importantly, NWs afforded a high mobility of 0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. 2c), which was ∼2 orders of magnitude higher than that of the planar film (9.2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1; see Fig. 2b). It should be noted that our value of the hole mobility in the planar MAPbI3 film is comparable to the values reported in the literature (∼10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1).32,33 The higher charge carrier mobility observed in NWs is consistent with previous studies and can be ascribed to the reduction of grain boundaries.15 The crystal structures of the MAPbI3 perovskite compact film and NWs were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI),† both samples exhibited strong diffraction peaks at 2θ = 14.1°, 28.4°, and 31.8°, corresponding to the (110), (220), and (310) planes, respectively. The main differences between these two samples were primarily reflected in the narrowing of diffraction peaks of perovskite NWs, which can be attributed to the increase in the average crystallite size or the decrease in the number of grain boundaries within the NWs.34,35 These results elucidate that the light absorption and carrier transport properties of NWs are superior to those of the planar film, which is beneficial for improving the photocurrent generation and charge extraction within the devices, as will be discussed below.

The photovoltaic performance of the devices based on MAPbI3 perovskite was then studied. The device structure was glass substrate/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3 planar film or NWs/PC61BM/PEI/Ag, as shown in Fig. 1a. The devices were measured under AM1.5G solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2). For the devices based on the MAPbI3 planar film (device A), a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 15.97% was observed, with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.01 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 20.78 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 76.09% (Table 1 and Fig. 3a). These values are in accordance with literature results for MAPbI3-based planar heterojunction devices.1 Substitution of the MAPbI3 planar film with MAPbI3 NWs (device B), however, yielded much inferior device performance (the best PCE = 0.11%), as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 3a. To elucidate the reasons behind such poor device performance, we investigated the surface coverage of the PC61BM film (thickness = 80 nm) on the MAPbI3 NW layer. As shown in Fig. 4a, the voids between the NWs could not be filled with the PC61BM layer. This problem still remained even when the thickness of the PC61BM layer was increased to 180 nm (Fig. 4b). These results are consistent with the fact that the small molecular weight PC61BM solution has a low viscosity, making it difficult to form intimate contact with organometal halide perovskite films, especially with rough surfaces. The poor contact between the perovskite NWs and PC61BM layer can lower the probability of free charge carrier generation, leading to exciton recombination losses. To gain more insight into the photoinduced charge transfer at the interface between perovskite NWs and PC61BM, the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) of MAPbI3 NWs in contact with different interfaces were studied. The pristine MAPbI3 NW sample (i.e., glass substrate/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3 NWs) exhibited a strong PL emission centered at ∼760 nm (Fig. 5a). When MAPbI3 NWs formed a contact with the PC61BM layer (i.e., glass substrate/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3 NWs/PC61BM), moderate PL quenching was observed, implying ineffective charge transfer at the MAPbI3 NWs/PC61BM interface. TRPL measurements were also performed to study the charge-transfer dynamics at the MAPbI3 NWs/PC61BM interface. The TRPL decays were acquired at the emission wavelength of 760 nm, and the obtained decays were fit with a double exponential function to yield the exciton lifetimes. The pristine MAPbI3 NW sample had an exciton lifetime of 28.4 ns, which slightly reduced to 18.2 ns for the PC61BM-coated sample (Fig. 5b). It should be noted that the exciton lifetime of the planar MAPbI3/PC61BM sample was much shorter than that observed in the MAPbI3 NWs/PC61BM sample (∼1 ns),24,26 confirming that the degree of charge transfer is inferior at the MAPbI3 NWs/PC61BM interface.

To ensure good contact properties between the MAPbI3 NWs and ETL, P(NDI2OD-T2) was adopted as an alternative ETL to replace PC61BM. P(NDI2OD-T2) possesses several advantages for use as an ETL in PeSCs such as an appropriate energy level, high electron mobility, and good stability.29,30 In addition, the high viscosity nature of the P(NDI2OD-T2) polymer is beneficial for the deposition of high quality films onto the perovskite layer, which is of great importance for the development of high-performance perovskite NW solar cells. As expected, when applying the P(NDI2OD-T2) film (160 nm) on the surface of the MAPbI3 NW layer, a uniform and pinhole-free morphology was observed (Fig. 4c). The intimate contact between the MAPbI3 NWs and P(NDI2OD-T2) ETL layer can facilitate efficient exciton dissociation via ultrafast charge transfer at the interface. To confirm this, the steady-state PL and TRPL studies of P(NDI2OD-T2)-coated MAPbI3 NWs were carried out. Encouragingly, significant PL quenching with a short exciton lifetime of 1.38 ns was observed (Fig. 5a and b). MAPbI3 NWs with the P(NDI2OD-T2) ETL exhibited a much shorter exciton lifetime than the PC61BM-based sample (Fig. 5b), suggesting more efficient charge transfer from MAPbI3 NWs to the P(NDI2OD-T2) ETL than in the case of the PC61BM ETL. The efficient exciton dissociation can favor the generation of photocurrent in the devices, as will be discussed later. These results clearly elucidate good electronic coupling at the interface between the MAPbI3 NWs and P(NDI2OD-T2) ETL.
A perovskite NW device employing P(NDI2OD-T2) as the ETL (device C) was fabricated and characterized (device structure: ITO-coated glass substrate/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3 NWs/P(NDI2OD-T2)/PEI/Ag). The best performing device showed a Voc of 1.01 V, a Jsc of 21.73 mA cm−2, a FF of 62.87%, and an overall PCE of 13.80% (Table 1 and Fig. 3a). Obviously, compared to PC61BM-based perovskite NW devices (device B), P(NDI2OD-T2)-based devices (device C) exhibited a much higher PCE (Table 1 and Fig. 3a), which could be ascribed to the improved contact properties at the P(NDI2OD-T2)/MAPbI3 NW interface as discussed previously. Although the photovoltaic performance of the perovskite NW device was significantly enhanced by employing P(NDI2OD-T2) as the ETL, the obtained PCE was still inferior to those of the devices based on the MAPbI3 planar film (Table 1 and Fig. 3a). To gain insight into the performance losses of the devices, dark current–voltage measurements were carried out. Compared to the devices based on the planar perovskite film (device A), perovskite NW-based devices (device C) exhibited higher series resistance and nearly comparable shunt resistance, leading to a lower rectification ratio (see Fig. 3b and ESI Table S1†). It is generally accepted that main contributions to the series resistance include the bulk resistance of the perovskite layer as well as the contact resistance between the electrodes and the perovskite layer.17,21 Since the bulk resistance of MAPbI3 NWs was even lower than that of the MAPbI3 planar film (Fig. 2b), we suggested that the increase in series resistance might result from the higher contact resistance at the cathode interface.
To address the above-mentioned issue, N-DPBI was introduced as the dopant into P(NDI2OD-T2) to form a highly conductive ETL material (see Fig. 1a for the chemical structure). Previous studies have shown that the N-DPBI dopant can undergo efficient electron transfer with n-type organic semiconductors, leading to a significant increase in electrical conductivity.36,37 Here, the influence of N-DPBI doping on the conductivity of the P(NDI2OD-T2) film was studied. For the undoped P(NDI2OD-T2) film, a low conductivity of ∼1.2 × 10−8 S cm−1 was observed (Fig. 5c), which is close to the literature values (∼10−8 S cm−1).37,38 The conductivity increased considerably to 7.4 × 10−5 S cm−1 at a low doping concentration of 5% (Fig. 5c). At an optimal doping concentration of 10 mol%, the electrical conductivity of the P(NDI2OD-T2) film reached a maximum value of 4.2 × 10−3 S cm−1 (Fig. 5c), being nearly 5 orders of magnitude higher than that of the undoped P(NDI2OD-T2) film. Beyond this optimal doping concentration, however, the film conductivity began to decrease (Fig. 5c). To gain a better understanding of the influence of the N-DPBI doping on the film conductivity, we performed AFM measurements on our samples (i.e., glass substrate/MAPbI3 NWs/P(NDI2OD-T2)) with different doping concentrations. The electrical conductivity data were found to correlate well with the morphological observation. For the sample with an optimal doping concentration of 10 mol%, a smooth and homogeneous morphology was observed (Fig. 4d), with a rms roughness of ∼2.28 nm (Fig. 5d). The uniform coverage of the 10 mol% N-DPBI-doped P(NDI2OD-T2) layer onto MAPbI3 NWs was confirmed by the cross-sectional SEM image (ESI Fig. S2†). Further increase in the doping concentration led to rougher surface morphologies (rms roughness = 4.37–5.23 nm) with more pronounced phase-separated domains (Fig. 5d). It should be noted that the surface roughness of the sample with an optimal doping concentration of 10 mol% was even lower than that of the sample with the pristine P(NDI2OD-T2) film (2.28 nm vs. 4.20 nm; see Fig. 5d), suggesting more favorable interfacial exciton dissociation for doped samples. This result was further confirmed by more pronounced reduction of the exciton lifetime measured in the N-DPBI-doped P(NDI2OD-T2) sample (0.78 ns) as compared with that of the pristine P(NDI2OD-T2) sample (1.38 ns; see Fig. 5b).
Encouragingly, the best-performing perovskite NW device employing 10 mol% N-DPBI-doped P(NDI2OD-T2) as the ETL (device D) exhibited a remarkable PCE up to 18.83% (with an exceptionally high FF of ∼80%), which is superior to those of NW devices with the undoped P(NDI2OD-T2) ETL (device C; see Table 1 and Fig. 3a). The performance improvement via N-DPBI doping could be rationalized in terms of the reduced series resistance (Table S1† and Fig. 3b). A comparison between our results and the characteristics of state-of-the-art perovskite NW solar cells is also depicted in ESI Table S2.† Notably, the PCE demonstrated herein represents the highest value ever reported for perovskite NW solar cells. It should be noted that the highest achievable PCE for NW devices with the doped P(NDI2OD-T2) ETL (device D) was even higher than that of the conventional planar device (device A; see Table 1 and Fig. 3a), suggesting the viability of using MAPbI3 NWs as the active layer for highly efficient PeSCs. The maximum incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) value of the conventional planar device (device A) and NW devices (device D) reached ∼84% and ∼91%, respectively (Fig. 3c). These results are consistent with the results obtained from UV-Vis absorption spectra (Fig. 2a). It should be noted that the measured Jsc of device D agreed well (within 10% error) with the Jsc value integrated from its corresponding IPCE spectrum (21.39 mA cm−2; see Fig. 3c), which confirmed the accuracy of our reported PCE value. Importantly, our NW devices with the doped P(NDI2OD-T2) ETL (device D) exhibited hysteresis-less J–V characteristics (ESI Fig. S3†), and the stabilized power output reached 18.20% (Fig. 3d). The histogram of the PCE values of 50 devices for device D revealed that more than 60% of the integrated devices afforded PCE above 17% (Fig. 3e), confirming the good reproducibility of our devices. Taking advantage of the high charge carrier mobility of MAPbI3 NWs (shown in Fig. 2c), the losses of photovoltaic efficiency in large-area devices were modest. As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 3f, the PCE remains high (∼17%) for the NW devices with a larger active area of 1.2 cm2 (device E). When scaling up to a larger active area of 5.04 cm2, the NW devices still showed a remarkable PCE up to 15.23% (device F; Table 1 and Fig. 3f), clearly demonstrating the scalability of our NW PeSCs. These results highlight the importance of interfacial engineering in achieving high-performance perovskite NW devices.
The long-term stability is an essential consideration for the commercialization of PeSCs. Considering that PeSCs are generally vulnerable to moisture, the implementation of hydrophobic interfacial capping layers and/or high-performance encapsulation layers has become increasingly important.25–28 The ambient stability of the MAPbI3 NW devices (device D) was then investigated by measuring their PCE periodically during storage in the ambient atmosphere (30 °C, 65% RH). As shown in Fig. 6a, the NW devices without encapsulation showed an obvious decline in the performance within 100 hours of aging, suggesting that the N-DPBI-doped P(NDI2OD-T2) ETL was insufficient to protect the underlying perovskite NW layer against degradation from moisture, even though this doped P(NDI2OD-T2) layer was hydrophobic (water contact angle = 103°; see ESI Fig. S4†). It should be noted that this degradation was much faster than that of MAPbI3 planar devices (device A; see Fig. 6a), suggesting that the NW devices might be more prone to degradation than the commonly used planar devices. This may be related to the fact that MAPbI3 NWs have a larger surface area exposed to the atmosphere than the MAPbI3 film, which is currently undergoing further investigation. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 6a, the degradation rate of the NW devices (without encapsulation) became much slower under low relative humidity conditions (∼30% RH), implying that the moisture effect was likely to be the major cause of device degradation. To address this stability issue, we employ low-temperature (100 °C) atomic-layer-deposited (ALD) Al2O3 film-coated polyethylene terephthalate (PET) as the encapsulation layer. The effectiveness of this ALD Al2O3-based film in preventing the ingression of moisture has been demonstrated in our previous studies, and an extremely low water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) value of 9.0 × 10−4 g per m2 per day is achieved.25,26 By adopting the ALD Al2O3-based film as the encapsulation layer for the NW devices (device D), negligible degradation (within 10% loss in PCE) was observed after ∼6000 hours of storage at room temperature (∼30 °C) in the ambient atmosphere (65% RH), as shown in Fig. 6b. The performance evolution of the encapsulated NWs devices (device E) upon long-term accelerated aging under thermal stress (85 °C, 85% RH) was also studied, and remarkable long-term stability could also be secured (Fig. 6b). More encouragingly, when the encapsulated NWs devices (device E) were aged at their maximum power point continuously for ∼1500 hours in the ambient atmosphere (30 °C, 65% RH) under AM1.5G sunlight irradiation (light intensity = 100 mW cm−2), the devices still remained fairly stable (∼20% loss in PCE; see Fig. 6b), clearly indicating the necessity of the encapsulation layer for perovskite NW solar cells.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated highly efficient and long-term stable p–i–n type perovskite NW solar cells by incorporation of the N-DPBI-doped P(NDI2OD-T2) ETL and ALD Al2O3 encapsulation layer into the devices. The resulting perovskite NW devices deliver a record high PCE of ∼19% (with a stabilized PCE of 18.2%), which is superior to those of the devices using the planar perovskite film as the active layer. Importantly, the large-area perovskite NW devices (active area = 5.04 cm2) also generate a promising PCE up to ∼15.3%. More encouragingly, the encapsulated NW devices exhibit excellent ambient stability, maintaining ∼92% of their initial efficiency over 6000 hours under ambient conditions. This work presents an important advance towards the realization of high-performance and long-term stable perovskite NW solar cells. The strategies demonstrated herein are expected to incite further development of perovskite NW-based optoelectronic devices.
Experimental
Materials
Patterned ITO-coated glass substrates (sheet resistance = 15 ohm sq−1) were purchased from Ruilong Tech. PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution (CLEVIOS P VP Al 4083) was purchased from Heraeus. Methylammonium iodide (MAI; >99.5%) was purchased from Lumtec. PC61BM (>99.5%) was purchased from Solenne. P(NDI2OD-T2) was purchased from 1-Material Inc. N-DMBI (98%) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.
Fabrication of MAPbI3 NWs
MAPbI3 NWs were prepared according to the literature procedures with slight modification.13,15,16 A layer of MAPbI3 perovskite planar film was first formed through a standard two-step sequential deposition method.25 Briefly, PbI2 and MAI were dissolved into anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF) and anhydrous 2-propanol with concentrations of 450 mg mL−1 for PbI2 and 40 mg mL−1 for MAI, respectively. Both solutions and substrates were heated at 100 °C for 10 min before being used. The PbI2 solution was spun on the preheated substrate (5000 rpm for 40 s) and then annealed at 70 °C for 10 min. The MAI solution was then spun on top of the dried PbI2 film (6000 rpm for 30 s), followed by annealing at 100 °C for 2 hours. A mixed solvent (70 μL DMF in 1 mL IPA) was then spin coated onto the perovskite thin film (4000 rpm for 30 s) and then annealed at 100 °C for 5 min. The thickness of MAPbI3 NWs was ∼420 nm.
Solar cell fabrication
ITO-coated glass substrates were first ultrasonicated in detergent, deionized water, acetone and 2-propanol in turn, followed by UV-ozone treatment for 60 min. After filtration through a 0.45 μm filter, the PEDOT:PSS layer (30 nm) was spin-coated on the cleaned ITO substrate at 4000 rpm for 60 s and then annealed at 120 °C for 15 min. The substrates were then transferred to a nitrogen-filled glovebox. For the devices based on the planar film, the MAPbI3 perovskite layer (∼350 nm) was prepared following two-step solution deposition, as described in our previous work.18–20,24–26 After the deposition of the perovskite layer, the solution of PC61BM (20 mg mL−1 in chloroform) or P(NDI2OD-T2) solution (15 mg mL−1 in 1,2-dichlorobenzene) with different doping ratios of N-DPBI was then spin-coated on top of the formed perovskite layers. The thickness of P(NDI2OD-T2) was 160 nm. Afterward, opaque Ag (150 nm) was deposited using a thermal evaporator under high vacuum (<10−6 torr). The ALD Al2O3 film (50 nm) was prepared following our previous procedures.25,26 To eliminate the Jsc from regions outside the active area, illumination masks with aperture sizes of 0.12, 1.2, or 5.04 cm2 were used.
Field-effect transistor fabrication
A 100 nm thick Al2O3 gate dielectric was deposited by ALD at 200 °C on a heavily doped p-type Si wafer that served as a back gate electrode. Afterward, the perovskite layer was deposited. Au metal contacts were subsequently deposited as the source/drain electrodes by thermal evaporation through a shadow mask. The channel length (L) and the channel width (W) were 60 μm and 3500 μm, respectively. Electrical characterization was carried out under vacuum using an Agilent 4156C semiconductor parameter analyzer. The field-effect mobility was extracted from the following equation in the saturation regime, ID = μCi(W/2L)(VG − VT),39 where ID is the drain current, μ is the field-effect mobility, W and L are the channel width and length, respectively, Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric, and VG is the gate voltage.
Characterization
The device characteristics were evaluated under ambient conditions under an AM1.5G AAA class solar simulator (XES-100S1, SAN-EI Electric. Co. Ltd.) with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. A Hamamatsu silicon solar cell (S1133) with a KG5 color filter, which is traced to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), was used as the reference cell. To calibrate the light intensity of the solar simulator, the power of the xenon lamp was adjusted to make the Jsc of the reference cell under simulated sunlight as high as it was under the calibration condition. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured by using a Keithley digital source meter (Model 2400). Unless otherwise stated, the scan rate was set at 0.15 V s−1. After initial measurements, the devices were kept under a controlled atmosphere using an indigenously made environmental control chamber. IPCE spectra were measured in DC mode using a lock-in amplifier with a current preamplifier under short-circuit conditions with illumination of monochromatic light from a 250 W quartz-halogen lamp (Osram) passing through a monochromator. Steady-state PL spectra were measured at room temperature by using a fluorescent spectrophotometer (Hitachi F-4600) with a 150W Xe lamp as an excitation source at 600 nm. Time-resolved PL decay spectra were recorded by using a time-correlated single-photon counting system (Edinburgh Instruments FL920), and the excitation light pulse was provided using a picosecond diode laser at a wavelength of 450 nm, and the signal was monitored at ∼760 nm. The PL lifetimes of the samples were calculated by fitting the experimental decay transient data to the double-exponential decay model. The surface morphology of the films was studied using tapping mode AFM using a Digital Instrument D3100CL. The electrical conductivities of the thin films were measured by using a four point probe setup with a source measurement unit (Keithley 2400). SEM was conducted with a field-emission SEM (S-4800, Hitachi) operated at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV with the samples coated with ∼3 nm of platinum. The XRD patterns were recorded using a multi-function high power X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8 DISCOVER SSS) as the CuK source (wavelength = 1.541 Å). The film thicknesses were measured by using a Tencor Alpha-step surface profiler.
