    , Accepted 30th October 2017First published on 30th October 2017AbstractIt is well known that bimetallic nanomaterials usually exhibit unique catalytic, optical, electric and magnetic properties due to the synergistic effect between different metals. In this work, we reported on a scalable method to fabricate an AuPt bimetallic core–shell nanoparticles loaded hematite (α-Fe2O3) photoanode for solar-driven photoelectrochemical water oxidation. Compared to single metal-modified α-Fe2O3 photoanodes, the AuPt bimetallic core–shell nanoparticles loaded α-Fe2O3 photoanodes exhibited a synergistic effect for photoelectrochemical water oxidation. The photocurrent density of AuPt0.2/α-Fe2O3 was boosted to 0.83 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode in a neutral electrolyte (0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution) under 45 W xenon lamp irradiation. The incident photon-to-photocurrent efficiency value of optimum AuPt0.2/α-Fe2O3 was estimated to be 58%, which was significantly higher than the single metal-modified α-Fe2O3 and pristine α-Fe2O3 photoanodes (<10%). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Mott–Schottky analysis confirmed that the Schottky junction formed by the AuPt bimetallic nanoparticles and α-Fe2O3 led to enhanced charge separation and band bending, resulting in a negative shift of onset potential. Based on the experimental and characterized results, a possible mechanism was proposed. This work provides an important reference for the design of other bimetallic-modified photoanodes for application in energy conversion.
1. Introduction
Photoelectrochemical water splitting, which converts unstable natural energy into storable chemical energy, is one of the most promising avenues to solving energy shortages and environmental pollution. For the photoelectrode, an ideal semiconductor material should meet the following conditions: (a) the semiconductor material should be cheap and easy to obtain, stable in aqueous solutions, environmentally friendly, and nontoxic. (b) It should have an appropriate band gap position (1.6 < Eg < 2.2 eV), namely, ensuring sufficient range of light absorption. (c) For n-type semiconductors, the valence band position should be higher than the water oxidation potential. (d) Energy conversion efficiency should not be less than 10% and the overall system cost should not exceed $150 m−2.1
Hematite (α-Fe2O3) is one of only a few promising semiconductors for photoelectrochemical water splitting applications due to its favourable band gap, enormous reserves in the lithosphere, non-toxicity, as well as excellent photocorrosion resistance and structural stability in alkaline solution.2–4 α-Fe2O3 has been theoretically expected to accomplish a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 16.8%.5 Unfortunately, extremely low conductivity and high electron–hole (e−–h+) recombination are the major challenges to be overcome before this material can be used for practical applications.6,7
Recently, bimetallic nanoparticles have shown great application value in various fields such as energy, catalysis and sensing detection, due to their higher activity, selectivity and durability in a number of different reactions in comparison to monometallic nanoparticles formed by either of the elements in the bimetallic system.8 Among the bimetallic compounds, noble bimetallic core–shell architectures consisting of two different metallic elements exhibited modified physicochemical properties deriving from the integration of two different chemical compositions at the nanoscale, which are particularly attractive due to the precise controllability of their structures and properties. It is generally agreed that bimetallic core–shell architectures possess many distinct advantages, including enhancement of chemical and thermal stability, tuning of optical properties, improvement in catalytic activity through the strain effect and/or electronic coupling, amplifying magnetic anisotropy, and serving as a critical intermediate in the formation of other types of structures.9–19 Compared with the monometallic counterpart, the enhanced catalytic activity of metallic core–shell structures is usually attributed to the synergistic interactions of the different metallic elements. These changes in the electronic structure influence the electronic and optical properties. Interestingly, the physicochemical properties of the bimetallic core–shell structure are greatly affected by the shell thickness. For example, Dai et al. reported that tuning Ag shells led to anisotropic bimetallic Au–Ag core–shell superstructures, displaying two distinctive plasmonic resonances in the near-infrared region.14 Zhang et al. demonstrated that an optimum shell thickness of Ag–Ag3Cu core–shell nanoparticles showed excellent oxygen reduction reaction.19 Optimizing the Pt layer thickness, Bao et al. reported that Pd–Pt3–4L core–shell octahedral nanocrystals exhibited greatly enhanced activity in the oxygen reduction reaction.12 Through the optimization of the Pt shell thicknesses, Ataee-Esfahani et al. showed that the optimal AuPt core–shell nano colloids exhibited enhanced activity as an electro-catalyst for a methanol oxidation reaction.20 As the Pt element exhibits high electro-catalytic activities for many reactions, the electro-catalytic activities can be adjusted by changing the thickness of Pt shell in the core–shell nanoparticles.21–23 Simultaneously, Au nanoparticles with different morphologies and sizes show different degrees of light absorption. Therefore, tailoring the thickness of the shell is critical for obtaining excellent optical and electrical properties in AuPt bimetallic core–shell nanostructures.
Inspired by these findings and the literature, we propose that optimizing the shell thickness of the bimetal catalyst is of great significance for AuPt core–shell/α-Fe2O3 composite photoanodes. In this work, we prepared diverse shell thickness AuPt bimetallic core–shell structures by the successive reduction method. The shell thickness could be simply controlled by the amount of precursor added. AuPt core–shell/α-Fe2O3 composite photoanodes were synthesized by simple spin coating strategies followed by roasting to enhance the adhesion between the bimetal and α-Fe2O3 photoanodes. Compared to single metal modified α-Fe2O3 photoanodes, bimetallic AuPt core–shell/α-Fe2O3 composite photoanodes showed a synergistic effect in enhancing the photoelectrochemical performance. Furthermore, the influences of the shell thickness on the photoelectrochemical performances of the AuPt/α-Fe2O3 photoanodes were investigated.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Ferric chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O), sodium nitrate (NaNO3), hydrochloric acid, chloroauric acid (HAuCl4), chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6), trisodium citrate dihydrate (C6H5Na3O7·2H2O), and L-ascorbic acid (C6H8O6) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical. All reagents were of analytical grade and were used as received without further purification.
2.2 Preparation

2.2.1 Preparation of the α-Fe2O3 photoanodes. 
α-Fe2O3 photoanodes were prepared on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) by a modified procedure based on the work by Ling et al.24 A Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave was filled with 20 ml aqueous solution containing 0.15 M FeCl3·6H2O and 1 M NaNO3 at pH 1.5 (adjusted by hydrochloric acid). A piece of FTO glass slide, washed with acetone, ethanol, and then deionized water, was put into the autoclave and heated at 95 °C for 4 h. A uniform layer of iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) film (yellowish colour) was formed on the FTO substrate. The FeOOH coated substrate was then washed with ethanol and deionized water to remove any residual salt, and subsequently sintered in air at 550 °C for 2 h at a heating rate of 2 °C min−1. During the sintering process, the FeOOH were converted into α-Fe2O3 photoanodes.


2.2.2 Preparation of the AuPt core–shell nanoparticles. 
The preparation of AuPt bimetallic core–shell nanoparticles was carried out in two steps. Au colloid (or seeds) was prepared firstly and then Pt was formed by chemical reduction on an Au sol surface. The Au sol was prepared by the sodium citrate reduction method based on modified version of the work by Yang et al.25 Typically, 50 mL of aqueous solution containing 4.65 mL 9.7 mM HAuCl4 was heated to boiling and 3 mL of 1% sodium citrate solution was quickly added. The solution was then kept boiling for another 40 min and was then cooled to room temperature, then stored in the refrigerator. The AuPt bimetallic core–shell nanoparticles were prepared by chemically reducing the Pt layer on the surface of the Au colloid. Typically, a calculated volume of 9.7 mM H2PtCl6 solution was added to the 5 mL Au colloid. The same volume of 0.1 M ascorbic acid solution with Pt chloride was added drop by drop at room temperature. After 12 h, H2PtCl6 was completely reduced on the Au colloid surface. The calculated deionized water was added to the mixture to maintain the total bulk volume of 10 mL. The bimetallic samples were labelled as AuPtx, where x stands for the volume ratio of H2PtCl6 to Au sol. For example, AuPt0.3 core–shell hydrosol was fabricated by 5 mL Au sol, 1.5 mL 9.7 mM H2PtCl6, 1.5 mL 0.1 M ascorbic acid aqueous solution and 2 mL deionized water.


2.2.3 Preparation of the AuPt/α-Fe2O3 photoanodes. 
A simple spin-coating process was utilized to integrate the AuPt core–shell nanoparticles with α-Fe2O3 photoanodes. Briefly, 0.2 mL of AuPt core–shell hydrosol was dripped onto the α-Fe2O3 photoanodes (1.2 cm × 2.4 cm), and spin coated at 3000 rpm for 10 s, followed by drying at 60 °C to evaporate water. The spin-coating and drying process were duplicated 25 times, followed by roasting for 20 min in a 120 °C oven to increase the adhesion between the bimetal and α-Fe2O3 photoanodes. The brief preparation process diagram is shown in Fig. 1.

2.3 Characterization
The as-prepared samples were carefully scraped off from the FTO. The crystalline phases of the as-prepared samples were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis using a D8 ADVANCE instrument (BRUKER, Germany) with Cu-Kα radiation over the 2θ range of 10–80° at a scanning rate of 7.0° min−1. Surface morphology analysis of the as-prepared samples was observed by field emission scanning electronic microscopy (FESEM) using a JSM 7001F (JEOL, Japan). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy TEM (HRTEM) was also employed to characterize the structure using a Tecnai G2 F30 S-TWIN 300 kV/FEG Transmission Electron Microscope equipped with a scanning and transmission electron microscope (STEM) mode (FEI, US). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed with an ESCALAB 250 XPS system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, US). All of the binding energies were referenced to the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV of the surface adventitious carbon. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were performed using a Quanta Master™ 40 Spectro fluorimeter (Photon Technology International, US) equipped with a 75 W lamp and dual excitation monochromators.
2.4 Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements
Photoelectrochemical measurements were investigated in a three-electrode cell. The obtained samples were employed as working electrodes, while Ag/AgCl (soaked in saturated KCl), Pt wire and 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution (pH = 7) were utilized as the reference electrode, counter electrode and electrolyte, respectively. The irradiation area is 1 cm2 under a 150 W xenon lamp (radiation intensity: 45 mW cm−2). The potential and other parameters were measured through an electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, CHI852C). Incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured by external quantum efficiency measurement system (Newport/Oriel, QE-PV-SI) connected to the electrochemical workstation. Unless otherwise noted, all the tests were performed under front-side illumination and the electrochemical potentials reported herein are calculated relative to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to the Nernst equation (ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 pH + 0.197), where ERHE is the potential versus a reversible hydrogen potential, EAg/AgCl is the potential versus the Ag/AgCl electrode, and pH is the pH value of the electrolyte. The IPCE values at special wavelengths were calculated at 300 to 650 nm at a potential of 0.62 V vs. Ag/AgCl by using a solar simulator (Newport 69920, 300 W xenon lamp, radiation intensity: 100 mW cm−2) equipped with a monochromator. The IPCE values were calculated using the following equation:  where λ is the wavelength of the incident light, i is the measured photocurrent density, and P is the power intensity of the incident monochromatic light. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured using a CHI 760E electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, China), and the frequency spectrum ranged from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz under the open circuit voltage. The EIS data was fitted using ZSimpWin software. Mott–Schottky measurements were performed with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 using a CHI 760E electrochemical workstation, in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte (pH = 7), in the dark at a frequency of 1 kHz.
3. Results and discussion
XRD analysis was employed to detect crystalline phases of the as-prepared samples. As shown in Fig. S1,† the diffraction peaks for the hematite are sharp and intense, indicating their highly crystalline nature. The diffraction pattern has five sharp peaks at 24.1°, 33.2°, 35.6°, 49.5° and 54.1°, corresponding to (012), (104), (110), (024) and (116) of α-Fe2O3 (JCPDS No. 79-1741) respectively. No characteristic diffraction peaks of Au and Pt are observed due to their extremely low loading content.
To examine the detailed size, morphology, and microstructure of the AuPt/α-Fe2O3 photoanodes, FESEM, HRTEM, selected area electron diffraction (SAED), and STEM mapping were carried out. As shown in Fig. 2(a), top-view FESEM images of α-Fe2O3 show smooth and regular nanorods with a nanoscale length. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the AuPt bimetallic nanoparticles with a similar average are distributed on the α-Fe2O3 surface after spin-coating and showed a slight agglomeration. The reason for this result is that the colloidal solution is an unstable thermodynamic system and possesses an intrinsic tendency to agglomerate automatically. The HRTEM and STEM mapping offer direct evidence of core–shell structures. As illustrated in Fig. 2(c), (f), (g) and Fig. S2,† it can be clearly seen that AuPt core–shell structural nanoparticles are loaded on the α-Fe2O3 nanorods and a wider distribution of Pt elements shows the Au seeds are completely wrapped up in the Pt shell. Simultaneously, the results of HRTEM and the corresponding SAED confirm that the Pt shell is typically polycrystalline in nature. As illustrated in Fig. 2(d), the visible lattice fringes with a spacing of about 0.23 nm clearly correspond to the spacing of the (111) planes of Pt. Meanwhile, the visible lattice fringes with a spacing of about 0.36 nm are consistent with an α-Fe2O3 (311) crystal face. As illustrated in Fig. 2(e), it can be clearly seen that a group of bright and regular concentric diffraction rings correspond to Pt (111), (200), (220) and (311). The above results show that the as-prepared samples have favourable crystalline structure.

XPS analysis was used to detect the compositional and chemical states of AuPt0.1/α-Fe2O3. As depicted in Fig. 3(a), obvious Fe, O, Pt, and carbon signals can be observed. Carbon is ubiquitous and is present on all surfaces for the XPS analysis. The carbon C 1s peak at 284.8 eV was used as a reference for the charge correction. As illustrated in Fig. 3(a) and (d), not surprisingly, no Au signal corresponding to an Au seed is detected. The reason for this result is that the XPS technique is detectable in a surface depth of 2–10 nm.26,27 Therefore, the Au core inside the Pt shell cannot be detected directly by the XPS technique, which is further confirmation for our claim that the AuPt bimetallic nanoparticles as core–shell structures have been successfully fabricated in the present work.28 As shown in Fig. 3(b), the presence of two peaks of Fe2p at a binding energy equal to 710.4 and 724.2 eV confirms the presence of a Fe3+ ion.29 The middle peak belongs to the satellite peaks associated with the Fe 2p3/2 peak.30 As exhibited in Fig. 3(c), the two peaks located at 529.8 and 531.4 eV are ascribed to O1s, confirming the presence of an O2− ion and hydroxyl groups (Fe–OH), respectively.31 In Fig. 3(e), the peak at 71.0 and 74.4 eV can be ascribed to Pt 4f7/2 and 4f5/2, indicating the presence of Pt (0).32 Compared to the standard data of pure atomic Pt4f (70.9 and 74.2 eV),33 the binding energies Pt4f are shifted to higher values suggesting that the presence of charge flows between the Au and Pt atoms, which is consistent with previous research.34,35 This result can be attributed to the fact that a descending Fermi level occurred in the inside of Au–Pt core–shell nanostructure, which constructed an extra electric field to facilitate the charge transportation within the metal co-catalyst and the migration toward the electrolyte for the chemical reaction.34

Linear-sweep-voltammetry (LSV) with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 was used to detect photoelectrochemical properties of as-prepared samples. As shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. S3,† the pristine α-Fe2O3 photoanodes display a relatively low photoresponse with a photocurrent density of 0.003 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V versus RHE. The reason for this result is poor charge separation efficiency. In contrast, Au/α-Fe2O3 and Pt/α-Fe2O3 exhibited an enhanced photocurrent after modifying the Au or Pt. However, it is worth noting that all bimetal-modified photoanodes exhibit a higher photocurrent than that of the single metal-modified. This result illustrates that the AuPt bimetallic nanoparticles could synergistically enhance the photoelectrochemical performance for application in photoelectrochemical water splitting. Prominently, AuPt0.2/α-Fe2O3 photoanodes exhibit a remarkable cathodic shift to the onset potential and an increase in the photocurrent density (0.83 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V versus RHE) compared with the pristine α-Fe2O3 photoanodes. The aforementioned distinct enhancement of photocurrent densities and the negative shift of onset potential can be attributed to the presence of bimetal, which can greatly suppress the interfacial charge recombination, that eventually boost the hole injecting into the electrolyte to conduct the water oxidation reaction.36–38

To investigate the charge transport behavior in these photoanodes, EIS studies were carried out. The largest semi-circle in the high-frequency range is usually regarded as the charge transfer resistance inside the semiconductor bulk phase. As shown in Fig. 5, pristine α-Fe2O3 photoanode exhibits a maximum radius of arc, indicating the worst charge transfer efficiency. Msd represents the measured values, and cal stands for calculational values. Significantly, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of hematite is considerably reduced from 1021 to 276 Ω after introduction of the AuPt0.2 bimetallic nanoparticles. The reduced Rct can be attributed to the improved charge separation efficiency of hematite.39 Compared to the pristine α-Fe2O3, in Fig. S4,† the all bimetal-modified photoanodes exhibit a relatively small radius of arc, indicating that loading AuPt core–shell nanoparticles can increase the charge transport efficiency of α-Fe2O3 photoanodes. More precisely, the photogenerated hole can transfer into the electrolyte more easily than the same process on the bare α-Fe2O3 photoanodes, hence resulting in a drastically decreased radius of the semi-circle. This is highly consistent with the LSV results. Moreover, it is worth noting that the enhancement of the charge transfer efficiency with shell thickness does not increase linearly, but has the optimal value.

The IPCE was employed to understand the relationship between the photoelectrochemical activity and light absorption. As shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. S5,† the IPCE of pristine α-Fe2O3 photoanodes is no larger than 10% in the whole test wavelength range (300–650 nm). Theoretically, the light response range of the α-Fe2O3 photoanode can reach 610 nm. Poor charge separation, unsatisfactory electrical conductivity and lower photon energy in the long wavelength region reduce the IPCE value of the α-Fe2O3 photoanode. A similar phenomenon has also been reported by Yang et al.40 Au/α-Fe2O3 and Pt/α-Fe2O3 exhibited enhanced IPCE. It is worth noting that all bimetal-modified photoanodes exhibit higher IPCE than that of the single metal-modified. This result further confirms that the AuPt bimetallic nanoparticles can effectively enhance the photoelectrochemical properties of α-Fe2O3 photoanodes. Notably, the AuPt0.2/α-Fe2O3 is found to achieve as high as 58% at λ = 300 nm and exhibits a significant enhancement over the pristine α-Fe2O3 in 300–460 nm.

To investigate the flat band potential (EFB) and the charge transfer processes between the semiconductor and electrolyte interfaces of the as-prepared samples, we performed Mott–Schottky testing in the dark to extrapolate each plot to the x-axis to obtain the intercept value. The slope of these plots is based on the Mott–Schottky equation:  where CSC is the capacitance of the space charge layer, ε the dielectric constant of the semiconductor, ε0 the vacuum permittivity, N the carrier density, E the applied potential, EFB the flat-band potentials, q the elementary charge, k the Boltzmann constant, and T the temperature. The intercept of the line in the abscissa is a flat band potential. As shown in Fig. 7, the pristine and bimetal-modified α-Fe2O3 photoanodes electrodes showed a positive slope in the dark, which is a typical feature for an n-type semiconductor with electrons as the majority carriers. It is worth noting that the flat band potential exhibit a partially positive shift with the change of shell thickness. According to the Mott–Schottky equation, the equation of carrier density is available:

For photoanodes, the charge at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface is mainly the h+. All bimetal-modified photoanodes exhibit a smaller slope value than that of pristine α-Fe2O3 photoanodes, namely a higher charge density. This result is attributed to the Schottky barrier built by semiconductors and metals that promotes charge separation, which ensured more charge moved to the surface of the semiconductor.41,42 The aforementioned results also confirm that the process of hole transfer can be improved effectively after modifications of the bimetal and the thickness of the shell has a maxima to the band bending. This formula intuitively illustrates the reason that the bimetal-modified photoanodes have better photoelectrochemical performances than pristine α-Fe2O3 photoanodes. This increase of band edge bending can be attributed to the increased charge density at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface, which is similar to previous reports.43,44
To further investigate the charge separation efficiency, photoluminescence (PL) analysis was employed to investigate charge separation. The lower the fluorescence intensity, the more efficient the charge separation.45 As illustrated in Fig. 8, all bimetallic modified composite photoanodes show lower fluorescence intensity compared with the pristine α-Fe2O3 photoanode, suggesting a better charge separation efficiency. In view of statistical thermodynamics, high charge separation efficiency ensures that the charge can effectively migrate to the semiconductor surface, resulting in a higher charge density.46–48

The long-term stability of a product is a non-negligible factor to consider for industrial applications. The chronoamperometry was employed to test the durability of the pristine α-Fe2O3 and AuPt0.2/α-Fe2O3 photoanodes at 1.23 V versus RHE. As shown in Fig. 9, the pristine α-Fe2O3 photoanodes exhibit excellent durability, which is consistent with existing literatures.49–51 However, the photocurrent density of the α-Fe2O3 photoanode is not ideal. Simultaneously, the photocurrent decay of AuPt0.2/α-Fe2O3 is negligible, suggesting the AuPt0.2/α-Fe2O3 is of excellent durability for photoelectrochemical water oxidation. All above results demonstrate that the AuPt0.2/α-Fe2O3 composite photoanodes possess excellent photoelectrochemical performance as well as durability, making it a promising photoanode for future applications.

Based on the above results, a possible reaction mechanism is proposed. As shown in Fig. 10, when the n-type semiconductors and bimetal come in close contact to each other, electrons continue to flow from the semiconductor to the bimetal because of the different work functions of the semiconductor and metal, until the Fermi level of the two materials are equal.52 In the space charge layer formed at the interface of the two materials, the metal surface will obtain the excess negative charge, while the semiconductor surface has an excess positive charge.53,54 The space charge layer (or barrier), formed on the interface between the semiconductor and metal, is called the Schottky junction.55 In this way, the band edge in a semiconductor will be curved upward.56 The conjecture was proved by Mott–Schottky tests. In pristine α-Fe2O3 photoanodes, photogenerated electrons rapidly recombine with holes in the bulk phase or interface of the semiconductor, resulting in poor photoelectrochemical performance. When bimetallic AuPt nanoparticles are loaded onto the surface of the α-Fe2O3 photoanodes, photogenerated holes are extracted into by the space charge layer, which promotes the transfer of photogenerated holes from α-Fe2O3 photoanodes to the bimetal and consequently to implant Pt shell on the Au core. This could effectively be a benefit for the metal/electrolyte interface reaction through both the Fermi energy bending and the excellent proton reduction nature.8,34 Then, the separated holes participate in the water oxidation reaction.

Conclusions
In summary, we have established a simple method to synthesize AuPt core–shell structure loaded α-Fe2O3 composite photoanodes. As compared to the pristine and single metal-modified α-Fe2O3 photoanodes, the AuPt/Fe2O3 composite photoanode exhibited an obvious synergistic effect which could greatly improve photoelectrochemical performance. In addition, the shell thickness had a significant influence on the photoelectrochemical performance. The EIS, Mott–Schottky and PL analysis confirmed that the enhanced photoelectrochemical performance that can be attributed to the bimetal can effectively promote the charge separation of α-Fe2O3 photoanodes.
