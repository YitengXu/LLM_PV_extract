    , Accepted 10th June 2016First published on 13th June 2016AbstractBecause of their ultimate thickness, layered structure and high flexibility, pn junctions based on layered two-dimensional semiconductors have been attracting increasing attention recently. In this study, for the first time, we fabricated lateral pn junctions (LPNJs) based on ultrathin MoTe2 by introducing two separated electrostatic back gates, and investigated their electronic and photovoltaic performance. Pn, np, nn, and pp junctions can be easily realized by modulating the conductive channel type using gate voltages with different polarities. Strong rectification effects were observed in the pn and np junctions and the rectification ratio reached ∼5 × 104. Importantly, we find a unique phenomenon that the parameters for MoTe2 LPNJs experience abrupt changes during the transition from p to n or n to p. Furthermore, a high performance photovoltaic device with a filling factor of above 51% and electrical conversion efficiency (η) of around 0.5% is achieved. Our findings are of importance to comprehensively understand the electronic and optoelectronic properties of MoTe2 and may further open up novel electronic and optoelectronic device applications.
Introduction
Semiconductor p–n junctions (PNJs) are the basic building blocks for application in electronics and optoelectronics. Recently, PNJs constructed from atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) layered semiconducting materials have attracted considerable attention.1–3 In contrast to traditional PNJs, these kinds of PNJs are predicted to exhibit novel physics and high device performances in optoelectronics because of their ideal thickness, layer structure and high flexibility. To explore the native physics and open up new applications, wide varieties of PNJs have been initially studied, such as MoS2/WSe2, MoSe2/WSe2, WS2/WSe2, MoS2/GaTe, MoS2/BP (BP: black phosphorous) and so forth.4–12 Prototype devices like photodetectors, solar cells and light emission diodes have also been demonstrated. Based on the device configurations, PNJs can be categorized into vertical and lateral PNJs (VPNJs and LPNJs). The former are stacks of different ultrathin 2D layered materials held together by relatively weak van der Waals (vdWs) forces and the latter are formed by the seamless ultrathin 2D layered “p” parts and “n” counterparts being interconnected by strong in-plane covalent bonding. Since a VPNJ is held together by weak vdWs forces, there is a vdWs gap between its “p” and “n” parts. This structural feature may cause some problems for carrier transport. In comparison with VPNJs, there is a more tight connection between the “p” and “n” parts in LPNJs where these connections are chemical bonds.
Generally, three methods have been developed to fabricate LPNJs. The first one is in situ chemical vapor deposition, which involves epitaxial growth at the edge of another pre-grown 2D monolayer material. For example, Duan et al., Huang et al. and Gong et al. reported the growth of lateral heterostructures: MoS2/MoSe2, WS2/WSe2 and WS2/MoS2, and MoSe2/WSe2, respectively.8,11,13 This method usually requires high lattice matching and similar chemical compositions between the two materials. The second method is patterned chemical doping in one individual material. For instance, Choi et al. established a LPNJ on an ultrathin MoS2 nanosheet via chemical doping in a selected area.14 This process requires complex chemical reactions and may introduce possible contamination. Electrostatically tuning LPNJs via two separated local gates is another efficient approach, in which ambipolar materials are highly desired. With the discovery of ambipolar 2D layered materials, such as WSe2, BP and MoSe2, LPNJs based on them have been realized in succession.15–19
Recently, 2H-MoTe2 has been found to be another important ambipolar material among the family of 2D layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs).20–27 Its monolayer is composed of hexagonal Mo sheets that are sandwiched between two hexagonal Te sheets and the monolayer thickness is around 0.7 nm, as shown in Fig. 1a. MoTe2 has two typical phases, i.e. semiconducting 2H and metallic 1T′ phases. MoTe2 can be switched from the 2H to the 1T′ phase using laser illumination or by changing the temperature.28,29 Its phase change is much easier to perform than that of other TMDCs such as WS2, which needs dangerous lithium intercalation chemistry.30 Utilizing this property, ohmic homojunction contacts can be obtained for high performance devices.29 In addition, 2H-MoTe2 has an indirect band gap of around 1 eV in the bulk form and a direct band gap of about 1.1 eV in the monolayer form at room temperature, which is the smallest among all semiconducting TMDCs.31 Lezama et al. have even reported that bilayer and trilayer MoTe2 are direct band gap semiconductors.32 This means that MoTe2 can absorb more sunlight and longer wavelengths for high performance optoelectronic devices and we do not have to synthesize monolayer MoTe2 to achieve a direct band gap. Importantly, previous research indicates that the mobility of ultrathin 2H-MoTe2 can surpass 10 cm2 V−1 s−1 without any optimization process, which is comparable to figures previously reported for MoS2.25 However, so far the optoelectronic properties, like the photoresponse and photovoltaic (PV) effects, of 2H-MoTe2 have not been reported yet and PNJs based on MoTe2 have not been investigated.

Here, we constructed a LPNJ based on an ultrathin 2H-MoTe2 nanosheet by introducing two separated back gates and, for the first time, investigated its photovoltaic performance. By tuning the two back gate voltages, we can efficiently obtain pn, np, nn, and pp I–V characteristics. Clear rectification effects were observed in the pn and np junctions. The ideality factor of m ≈ 2 for both pn and np configurations indicates that the current is mostly dominated by recombination rather than diffusion.19 Further, by carefully investigating the rectification I–V characteristics at various back gate voltages, we find that all of the parameters have an abrupt change, when the conductive type changes from n to p or p to n. This possibly arises from the joint effects of carrier densities, channel resistance, and pn junction barrier height when tuning the gate voltages. Under the illumination of a 473 nm laser, ultrathin 2H-MoTe2 LPNJs display unique PV properties, such as an open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, high photogenerated power and high PV efficiency as well.
Results and discussion
Raman spectroscopy measurements were performed using a 532 nm laser, and are shown in Fig. 1b. The MoTe2 ultrathin flake shows several obvious Raman active modes between 100 cm−1 and 300 cm−1: the out-of-plane A1g at 171 cm−1, the in-plane E2g1 at 232 cm−1 and the out-of-plane B2g1 at 289 cm−1. These Raman features match those observed in 2H-MoTe2 very well, thus confirming that the MoTe2 crystal belongs to the 2H phase.25 The peak intensity ratio of B2g1/E2g1 is calculated to be around 0.15. According to the relationship between the Raman intensity ratio and the number of layers reported by Nakaharai et al.,22 the MoTe2 thickness shown in the inset of Fig. 1b is estimated to be ∼8 layers.
To investigate the electrical properties of 2H-MoTe2, a simple back-gated two-terminal device has been fabricated. The inset in Fig. 1c shows an AFM image of the MoTe2 device. The channel length (L) is 1.2 μm, the width (W) is 2.4 μm and the thickness is 7.3 nm. The electrical measurements are conducted in ambient conditions at room temperature. A drain voltage, Vds, of 500 mV was applied and the source electrode was grounded. From the transfer curve shown in Fig. 1c, it can be clearly seen that MoTe2 exhibits a remarkable ambipolar characteristic when scanning gate voltages (Vgs) from −80 to 80 V.
This should benefit from its small band gap and absence of Fermi level pinning. In contrast, it is difficult to obtain ambipolar behavior from MoS2 because of its strong Fermi level pinning and larger band gap. The on/off ratio is 2.1 × 104 for its electron channel and 8.4 × 103 for its hole channel, which are both higher than those observed in ambipolar BP and WSe2.33,34 The field effect mobility (μFE) can be estimated by the equation:  where d is the gate oxide thickness (300 nm), ε0 is the vacuum permittivity (8.854 × 10−12 F m−1), and εr is 3.9 for SiO2. Based on the device configuration, the μFE of 7 nm thick MoTe2 is calculated to be 7.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for electrons and 4.3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for holes. The strong ambipolar characteristics accompanied with high mobility for both electrons and holes provides the possibility to realize high performance MoTe2 LPNJs via electrostatic gating. As shown in Fig. 1d, the I–V curves at different Vgs (−50, 0, 50 V) present good linearity, which indicates that the device has good ohmic contacts. All of the above device performance parameters, such as a high on/off ratio, high mobility for both electrons and holes, and good electrical contacts, help to obtain high performance MoTe2 LPNJs.
Note that the adsorbates in ambient conditions pronouncedly affect the I–V characteristics. After 4 h of being held under vacuum to remove the surface adsorbates, the “n” part is obviously enhanced, conversely, the “p” part is remarkably weakened (see Fig. S1 in ESI†). This may originate from the removal of the surface p-dopant adsorbates. When exposing the device to air overnight, the I–V characteristics can almost be restored (see Fig. S1c in ESI†). To eliminate the effects of surface adsorbates, all of the following electrical measurements are taken under vacuum.

Fig. 2a and b represent a schematic of a MoTe2 LPNJ device and the corresponding optical micrograph, respectively, where three independent voltages are applied to the devices: Vg1 for the left back-gate, Vg2 for the right back-gate, and the bias voltage Vds through the drain (D) and source (S) contacts. Compared with the configurations of previous two separated top gate devices,22,35 our two splitting back gate configuration shows significant advantages for developing optoelectronic devices since the upper surface of the device can be fully exposed to the light. Conversely, top gate electrodes would block light illumination of the devices. As seen from Fig. 2c, the gap between Vg1 and Vg2, the channel length and the layer thickness are measured to be around 213 nm, 4.5 μm and 5 nm, respectively. The thickness corresponds to 6–7 layers. In addition, a 20 nm thick HfO2 dielectric layer is used to separate the back-gates and the channel materials. After device preparation, first we investigated the transfer characteristics by scanning Vg2 from −5 to 5 V, leaving Vg1 electrically floating. As depicted in Fig. 2d, clear ambipolar behavior was observed, namely, the device is p-type at Vg2 < 0 and n-type at Vg2 > 0, which indicates that both electrons and holes can be injected into the channel by adjusting the gate voltage. Note that Ids just approaches the level of nA and this appears to be a saturated trend, which is because Vg2 is only half gating to the whole MoTe2 channel and the other half of the channel which is undoped limits the currents. In addition, when leaving Vg2 electrically floating and scanning Vg1 from −5 to 5 V, similar transfer curves were obtained (see Fig. S2 in ESI†). We note that there is little difference in the drain currents between these two scanning methods. This should arise from the asymmetric device structure.

(d) Variation of drain current (Ids) with Vg2 when a drain voltage (Vds) of 500 mV is applied and Vg1 is set free. The black curve is on a linear scale and the blue curve is on a logarithmic scale.

(f) The I–V curves of pn and np in panel (e) shown on a natural logarithmic scale. 
The bias applied on the two separated gates can independently control the carrier density and type. Fig. 2e displays I–V curves under different gate biasing conditions. The device shows highly conductive nn or pp characteristics when Vg1 = Vg2 = 5 V or Vg1 = Vg2 = −5 V. The pp junction demonstrates lower currents than the nn junction, which agrees with those shown in Fig. 2d. This is associated with a lower p-doping charge density and the Schottky barriers between pp channel and contacts. In contrast, when applying opposite voltages on Vg1 and Vg2, strong rectification behaviors or diode-like responses were observed. The black and green curves in Fig. 2e respectively represent np and pn junctions, where Vg1 = 5, and Vg2 = −5 for the np junction; and Vg1 = −5, and Vg2 = 5 for the pn junction. The rectification ratios (RFs) respectively approach 5.2 × 104 and 4.9 × 104, which are comparable to some vertical heterostructures.10,36 RF is defined as Iforward/Ibackward at Vds = ±1 V. Fig. 2f shows the pn and np rectification curves on a natural logarithmic scale. From Fig. 2f, we deduce the ideality factor m = 2.1 for pn and 2.2 for np based on the following functional relationship:  where q is the electron charge, m is the ideality factor, k0 is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. The value of the ideality factor implies that recombination rather than diffusion currents dominates forward currents in the MoTe2 LPNJ, indicating that lots of recombination centers exist in MoTe2. It should be noted that the small difference in RF and ideality factor in NPJ and PNJ is attributed to the asymmetric device structure.
To gain deep insight into the processes of how the channel switches between p type and n type, we carefully investigated the I–V characteristics of MoTe2 devices at various gate voltages, as shown in Fig. 3. Initially, we fixed the left Vg1 = 5 V and increased the right Vg2 from −5 V to 5 V with steps of 1 V. The I–V curves on a logarithmic scale are recorded in Fig. 3a. It's obvious that the device manifests remarkable rectification effects from Vg2 = −5 to −1 V like a pn diode, circled in Fig. 3a. The backward currents approach the pA (10−12 A) level and the forward currents are up to the μA level. In contrast, from Vg2 = 0 to 5 V, the backward currents gradually increase up to the same level as the forward currents. To deeply understand the transition process from “np” to “nn”, Ids at Vds = ±1 V, RF, and Vth are extracted from Fig. 3a, and displayed in Fig. 3b–d, respectively. Here, Vth is the intercept in the “Vds” axis by fitting the rectification I–V curves on a normal scale (see Fig. S3 in ESI†), representing the threshold voltage of “on” state and reflecting the height of the barrier (pn or nn). In Fig. 3b, the green curve is Ids at Vds = −1 V (forward currents) and the dark yellow curve is Ids at Vds = 1 V (backward currents). After calculation of Iforward/Ibackward at Vds = ±1 V in Fig. 3b, the relationship of RF with Vg2 is plotted in Fig. 3c. It can be seen that RF experiences three stages: decreasing with Vg2 from −5 to −2 V; abruptly increasing with Vg2 from −2 to −1 V; and gradually decreasing with Vg2 from −1 to 5 V. Surprisingly, Vth shows the same trend, as illustrated in Fig. 3d. Similarly, when fixing the left Vg1 = −5 V and changing Vg2 from −5 to 5 in steps of 1 V, analogous results are obtained, as shown in Fig. 3e–h. In addition, another different device also shows very similar results (see Fig. S4 in ESI†). We conclude that these phenomena are typical behaviors of the pn junctions based on electrostatic modulation. That is, the performance parameters (such as Vth, RF and others) have an abrupt change during the transition of p to n or n to p. In the case shown in Fig. 3a, the junction is np when Vg2 is set from −5 to −2 V, it undergoes an np to nn transition when Vg2 is from −2 to −1 V and it is nn when Vg2 is set from −1 to 5 V. However, this kind of pn junction is very different to conventional pn junctions, composed of a typical p part and n part. The transition process is very complex, because when changing the gate voltages, accompanying changes take place in the channel resistance, contact resistance and the pn barrier height. A tentative explanation is proposed in ESI, as shown in Fig. S7.† To clearly state the mechanism of the p to n transition, further research is needed.

Variation of (c) and (g) RF, and (d) and (h) threshold voltage (Vth) with Vg2. RF is defined as Iforward/Ireverse at Vds = ±1 V. Vth is the intercept in the “Vds” axis by fitting the rectification I–V curves. Biasing conditions: for (a)–(d) Vg1 is fixed as 5 V. Conversely, for (e)–(h), Vg1 is fixed as −5 V. 
The PV effects of the device are studied using a 473 nm laser with a maximum power density of 248 mW cm−2. Fig. 4a presents the representative I–V curves based on the np (Vg1 = 5 V) junction at various Vg2 under 473 nm laser illumination. In Fig. 4a, the PV effects can be evidently observed when Vg2 is applied from −5 to −2 V. Otherwise, when Vg2 is above −1 V, no obvious PV effects are observed. This result is in good agreement with that shown in Fig. 3c and d, which confirms that the np junction exists only when Vg2 is below −2 V. In particular, both the open circuit voltage (Voc) and short circuit current (Isc) reach their maximum of 0.28 V and 28 pA at Vg2 = −5 V. When considering the cross sectional area of the device shown in Fig. 2c, the maximal short circuit density (Jsc) approaches 124 mA cm−2, which is a huge value compared to vertical pn junctions.4 These results may be attributed to the fact that a larger Vg2 creates a higher pn barrier and generates lower channel resistance by electrostatic doping.

(d) Short circuit current (Isc, red) and open circuit voltage (Voc, green), (e) Pmaxel and FF, and (f) photovoltaic efficiency (η), are all shown as functions of the laser power density (P) on a logarithmic scale. Pmaxel is marked by green dots in panel (c). For (b)–(f), Vg1 = 5 V and Vg2 = −5 V. 
We next explore the PV effects under laser illumination with various power densities (P) from 284.0 to 15.8 mW cm−2. Fig. 4b presents the I–V curves of the np junction (Vg1 = 5 V and Vg1 = −5 V) under various light power densities. Fig. 4c shows the extracted electrical powers (Pel) as a function of Vds. Pel is defined as Ids × Vds. Isc, Voc, Pmaxel, filling factor (FF), and the photovoltaic efficiency (η) as functions of the light power density (P), are shown in Fig. 4d–f, respectively. As we can see, Isc follows a power-law dependence with P, namely, Isc = Pα.19,37,38 Here, α is an indicator of what kind of recombination mechanism dominates the carrier loss in photovoltaic devices. When α = 0.5 and 1, the carrier losses in the device are controlled by pure bimolecular recombination processes and pure monomolecular recombination mechanisms, respectively.37 Our results show that α = 1.23, which is close to one. So the carrier losses in MoTe2 photovoltaic devices are dominated by monomolecular recombination (i.e. SRH recombination). Meanwhile, the relatively large deviation from one indicates that there is more complex recombination in the device. Another device shows α = 1.15 (see Fig. S5 in ESI†). According to the planar model proposed by D. Cheyns et al.,39 the Voc follows a power-law dependence (dVoc/dlog(P) = 2.3nvoc(kBT/e)), where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the Kelvin temperature and e is the electron charge. nvoc is the factor determining the recombination processes for the electrons and holes at the interface. By fitting Voc with log(P) as shown in Fig. 4d, we obtain nvoc is 2.8. Generally, nvoc = 2 is considered as an indicator that Shockley–Read–Hall recombination dominates the carrier loss during transport.10 So in electrostatically tuned MoTe2 pn junctions, there are possibly more complex recombination processes. Pmaxel approaches its maximum at around 7.6 pW. FF is nearly independent of the light power density and reaches its maximum at about 51%. Based on the device configuration, described in Fig. 2b and c, the electrical conversion efficiency (η) can be obtained as being ∼0.5% at the laser intensity of 132.3 mW cm−2. This value is comparable to most of the others based on this kind of device structure.19 In addition, the gap distance between the two separated back gates may significantly affect the device performance. When we increase the gap distance up to 2 μm, a better PV performance can be obtained (see Fig. S6 in ESI†).
Conclusions
In summary, for the first time we have constructed ultrathin MoTe2 LPNJs by fabricating two separated electrostatic back gates and we have systematically investigated their electrical and PV performances. The channel conductive type can be efficiently modulated by applying different polarity gate voltages, which is a benefit of the ambipolar properties of MoTe2. Strong rectification effects were observed in the pn and np junctions and the RF approaches ∼5 × 104. The ideality factor of the pn diode is calculated to be ∼2, which indicates that the forward current is mostly dominated by recombination processes. Importantly, we find that the parameters for electrostatically tuned MoTe2 LPNJs experience abrupt changes during the transition from p to n or n to p. The ultrathin MoTe2 LPNJs display unique PV properties. FF approaches 51% and the electrical conversion efficiency reaches 0.5%, which are both comparable to most reported values based on this kind of device configuration. Our findings are of importance to comprehensively understand the electronic and optoelectronic properties of MoTe2 and further may open up a new pathway to novel electronic and optoelectronic device applications.
Experimental
To fabricate a back-gated FET device
MoTe2 ultrathin flakes were mechanically exfoliated from bulk MoTe2 (99.995%, HQ Graphene) using a standard Scotch tape method and transferred to a heavily doped p-type substrate covering a 300 nm thick thermal oxidation layer. The electrical contacts were defined using e-beam lithography (EBL) and then Cr/Au (8 nm/60 nm) was deposited using a thermal evaporation machine.
To fabricate the MoTe2 device with two separated local back gates

Fig. 2a illustrates the scheme of the device. Firstly, the EBL is used to prepattern a pair of local back gates separated by 200 nm and then a 3 nm/10 nm thick Cr/Au thin film is deposited. Secondly, a pair of 8 nm/80 nm thick Cr/Au electrodes respectively connected one of the prepatterned local back gates to the other as the Vg1 and Vg2 electrodes. Thirdly, the above Cr/Au patterns were covered by 20 nm HfO2 as the dielectric layer using an Atomic Layer Deposition machine (ALD, KMT-100O3, KE-Micro). Fourthly, the ultrathin MoTe2 flake is transferred onto the prepatterned separated local back gates using a wet transfer method.40 Finally, source and drain contacts (Cr/Au, 8 nm/80 nm) were finished using e-beam lithography and thermal metal evaporation.
Characterization and measurements
Confocal Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw Invia, 532 nm excitation laser) was used to collect the Raman signals of MoTe2. The morphology of MoTe2 was examined using atomic force microscopy (AFM, Veeco Multimode), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800). All of the electrical transport measurements were conducted on a probe station (Lakeshore, TTPX) equipped with a semiconductor characterization system (Keithley 4200) under vacuum (∼6.0 × 10−5 torr) at room temperature, if not particularly indicated. The photovoltaic experiments were measured using a 473 nm laser (RGBLase).

 	Fig. 1  (a) Three-dimensional schematic structures of α-MoTe2. Mo, blue balls; Te, yellow balls. (b) Raman spectrum of a 2H-MoTe2 flake taken under a 532 nm excitation laser. The optical graph of the sample is shown in the inset. (c) Typical transfer curve of a back-gated MoTe2 FET. The drain voltage was set as 500 mV and the source was grounded. 300 nm thick SiO2 was used as the dielectric layer. Inset is an optical image of a MoTe2 FET. (d) Output characteristics of the MoTe2 FET. (c) and (d) are measured in ambient conditions.	 

 		 

 	Fig. 2  Cartoon (a), optical micrograph (b) and AFM image (c) of an ultrathin MoTe2 p–n junction device with two separated Au back gates (Vg1 and Vg2, ∼200 nm gap), with source (S) and drain (D) contacts. (d) Variation of drain current (Ids) with Vg2 when a drain voltage (Vds) of 500 mV is applied and Vg1 is set free. The black curve is on a linear scale and the blue curve is on a logarithmic scale. (e) I–V curves of the device in the dark. The biasing conditions: p–n junction (green curve, Vg1 = 5 V, and Vg2 = −5 V); n–p (black, Vg1 = −5 V, and Vg2 = 5 V); n–n (red, Vg1 = 5 V, and Vg2 = 5 V); p–p (blue, Vg1 = −5 V, and Vg2 = −5 V). (f) The I–V curves of pn and np in panel (e) shown on a natural logarithmic scale.	 

 		 

 	Fig. 3  (a) and (e) I–V curves of the MoTe2 p–n junction device with variation of Vg2 from −5 V to 5 V. (b) and (f) Variation of Ids with Vg2 at Vds = −1 V (green) and 1 V (dark yellow). Variation of (c) and (g) RF, and (d) and (h) threshold voltage (Vth) with Vg2. RF is defined as Iforward/Ireverse at Vds = ±1 V. Vth is the intercept in the “Vds” axis by fitting the rectification I–V curves. Biasing conditions: for (a)–(d) Vg1 is fixed as 5 V. Conversely, for (e)–(h), Vg1 is fixed as −5 V.
