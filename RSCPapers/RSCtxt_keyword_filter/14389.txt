However, under environmental conditions, it will undergo the phase transition from the α phase to the γ phase and finally to the non-perovskite phase (δ), especially in a humid environment. Considering the important role of surface intrinsic defects in the phase transition process, we investigated the intrinsic defects on α, γ and δ-CsPbI3 (001) surfaces by first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). The formation energy of most defects on the surface is similar to that in the bulk in all three phases except for VPb and VI. The formation energy of VPb and VI on the α-CsPbI3 (001) surface is significantly increased, and the formation energy of VPb on the γ-CsPbI3 (001) surface is also increased, due to the relaxation and distortion of the surface Cs and the Pb–I octahedron. The formation energy of interstitial defects on the α-CsPbI3 (001) surface is the lowest due to the remaining large dodecahedral void, even though the Pb–I octahedron distortion has largely enhanced the stability of the α-CsPbI3 (001) surface. The formation energy of VCs is the lowest in all three phases, indicating that Cs ions in CsPbI3 are indeed flexible in CsPbI3. The results are expected to provide a theoretical basis and guidance for the stability improvement of all-inorganic halide perovskites especially in a humid environment.
1. Introduction
Perovskite structural materials have been applied in the photovoltaic field, and achieved unprecedented success, so they are considered as competitive candidate materials.1–5 In the past few years, the organic–inorganic halide hybrid perovskites (HHPs) with the formula ABX3 (where A is an organic cation, B is Pb or Sn, and X is a halogen) have attracted great attention in solar cell applications, photovoltaic modules of which with low cost and high power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 20% have become a reality.6–9 However, the thermal instability of HHPs and their instability under other external stimuli such as oxygen, radiation etc. seriously hinder their further development and commercialization.10–12 In order to overcome the problems of HHPs, all-inorganic perovskite halides (IHPs) such as CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) have been paid more and more attention,13–22 among which CsPbI3 shows stronger thermal stability and better photoelectric properties. However, CsPbI3 has a variety of crystal structures, including three kinds of photoactive perovskite black phases (α, β, γ) and a non-photoactive non-perovskite yellow phase (δ).23–25 CsPbI3 can easily transform from the α, β, γ phase to the δ phase, and the transformation can be affected by the environment and specifically accelerated in a humid environment.23–25 In the past few years, a large amount of research work has been devoted to improve the stability of CsPbI3 solar cells, and the strategies developed includes reducing the size to make them low-dimensional or nanocrystalline, substitution doping and also surface modification, etc.25–30
Researchers have paid significant attention to the phase transition mechanism of CsPbI3. First, it has been elaborated that the intrinsic vacancy could further lower the formation enthalpy of the δ phase and facilitate the phase transformation.18 On the other hand, Kye et al. pointed out that cation vacancies can weaken the interaction between Cs and PbI6, thus lowering the nucleation barrier.31 Straus et al. further studied the microscopic origin of the phase transition adopting the single crystal X-ray diffraction and X-ray pair distribution function (PDF) measurement characterization, and suggested that the rattling of Cs, low number of Cs–I contacts, and high degree of octahedral distortion cause the instability of perovskite-phase CsPbI3. As far as the effect of H2O is concerned, it is elaborated that H2O acts as a catalyst during the phase transformation of CsPbI3; thus in a humid environment, CsPbI3 tends to nucleate from the surface or interface and further undergo phase transformation.18,32 Lin et al. pointed out that H2O adsorbs on the surface of α-CsPbI3 film, introduces I− vacancies VI in the crystal lattice and lowers the nucleation energy barrier, thus effectively catalysing the transformation of the α phase to the δ phase at room temperature.33 As can be seen, intrinsic defects, on the surface in specific, which could be related to the Cs and PbI6 octahedron distortion, are expected to play an important role in the stability of perovskite solar cells.
There have been several literature reports on the bulk defects of α, γ and δ-CsPbI3;34,35 however, research on the surface defects is still lacking. Considering that the surface is crucial to the phase transformation of CsPbI3 as has been elaborated,18,32 understanding the surface defects would be important. In this work, we systematically studied the intrinsic defects on the (001) surface of the α, γ and δ phase of CsPbI3 by using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. The formation energy of defects on the surfaces of CsPbI3 (001) under different chemical potentials (Pb-rich and Pb-poor) was discussed. We also compared the calculated formation energy with the defects in the corresponding bulk phases to clarify the characteristics of surface defect distribution different from the bulk phases of CsPbI3. Based on the calculation result, we intend to provide a theoretical view from the defect aspect for the phase transition mechanism of CsPbI3-based perovskite materials.
2. Calculation methods
Our calculation is based on first-principles calculations of density functional theory (DFT),36 and we used Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) software for research.37,38 The interaction between ions and electrons is described by projection augmented wave potential (PAW).37 In this paper, Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA)39 is used for the exchange correlation functional.40 The plane wave cut-off energy is 450 eV, and the energy convergence criterion is 10−6 eV. All structures are fully optimized until the Hellmann–Feynman force on each atom was less than 0.01 eV Å−1. The surfaces were modeled by atomic slabs separated by vacuum regions of approximately 18 Å. As shown in Fig. 1, nine atomic layers and four octahedral layers were constructed for the α, γ-CsPbI3 (001) surface, and three octahedral layers were constructed for the δ-CsPbI3 (001) surface. The thickness of the slab was chosen to give the surface energy of −2.01, 3.96 (Pb-rich)/2.57 (Pb-poor), 6.1 meV Å−2 for α, γ and δ-CsPbI3 in respective, which are converged around 0.2 meV Å−2, and the reason why we chose the thickness of 18 Å will be addressed in the following paragraph. Considering that the CsI-termination of CsPbI3 (001) surface is the most stable surface with the lowest energy,41 we calculated the CsI-terminated (001) surfaces of α, γ and δ-CsPbI3 (001) films respectively. As for the surface defect calculations, we expanded the crystal matrix into a 2 × 2 supercell in the ab plane on the basis of the surface unit cell, as can be seen in Fig. 1. For α, γ and δ-CsPbI3 surface systems, 3 × 3 × 1, 2 × 2 × 1 and 4 × 2 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack K-meshes were used respectively, and the K-meshes were chosen to correspond to 6 × 6 × 6, 4 × 4 × 3 and 9 × 4 × 4 for the bulk phases. The lattice constants obtained for α-CsPbI3 are a = b = c = 6.414 Å, for γ-CsPbI3a = 8.853 Å, b = 8.931 Å, c = 12.758 Å, and for δ-CsPbI3, a = 4.879 Å, b = 10.812 Å, c = 18.213 Å, which are consistent with previous calculations.34,35 The intrinsic defects studied in this work includes vacancies VCs, VPb, and VI, interstitials Csi, Pbi, and Ii and substitutions CsI, ICs, PbI, IPb, CsPb, and PbCs. The interstitial defects are in the surface layer or the interlayer between the surface and subsurface layer. As the surface is CsI-terminated, vacancy VCs, VI and substitution CsI, ICs, PbI, PbCs were in the surface Cs–I layer, and vacancy VPb and substitution IPb, CsPb were in the subsurface Pb–I layer.

3. Calculation results and discussion
In order to analyse the stability of defects, we calculated the formation energy of different surface defects, and to clarify the charge localized on defects, which may be crucial to the defect properties, we considered the different charged states of each defect. For a defect α with a charged state q, the formation energy ΔHf (α, q) is a function of the Fermi level EF and the chemical potential μi of the constituent elements contained in the defect,42–44 (1)where E(α, q) is the energy of the defect α with the charged state q. E(host) is the energy without any defects. εVBM(host) is the energy of the valence band maximum (VBM). EF is the energy of Fermi level measured from the VBM and varies within the band gap. When EF = 0, it means that the Fermi level falls at VBM. q is the number of electrons exchanged when defects are formed, and ni is the number of atoms i increased (ni < 0) or decreased (ni > 0) from the surface. E(i) is the chemical potential of the related element solid, and μi is the chemical potential of the related element relative to E(i). Analogous to the determination of chemical potential in the bulk phase,34,35 we have determined the range of chemical potentials in our calculations, as can be seen in Fig. 2, and as in the bulk, two representative chemical potential points A (Pb-rich) and C (Pb-poor) were also selected to study on the surface. The final term Ecorr accounts for the alignment of the finite-size effects resulting from the long-range Coulomb interaction of charged defects in a homogeneous neutralizing background.

When isolated charged defects are modelled in the supercell model, spuriously repeated charges due to the supercell periodicity add to physical image charges; thus the real electrostatic energy (Eiso) of the charged defect system needs to be obtained by extrapolating from the finite supercell size (Eperiod). The correction term Ecorr should be obtained as, Ecorr = Eiso − Eperiod. Eiso and Eperiod can be obtained following ref. 45. On the other hand, as has been addressed,46 when the vacuum thickness is given at a certain value, the required correction is smaller and can be neglected; thus we checked the appropriate thickness for this system. As can be seen in Fig. 3(a), the extrapolated isolated electrostatic energy Eiso has been obtained for different vacuum thicknesses, where Eiso is the same, while Eperiod is different for different vacuum thicknesses, and Ecorr is smallest when the thickness is 18 Å, indicating that the appropriate thickness for this system is probably 18 Å. Moreover, we have checked the effect of the charge distribution and defect position (within Pb–I or Cs–I layer) on the correction (Fig. 3(b)). It can be seen that the deviation is rarely violated between the charge distribution with half width σ of 0.96 Å and 1.6 Å, which is consistent with the previous estimation that the correction values for different defects in the same system of charge q are comparable.46 The correction is usually proportional to its charge ∼q2, and thus the correction value is only smaller than 0.1 eV even for the +2/−2 charged defect in CsPbI3. As for the different defect position, it can be seen that the deviation is also small. Thus, we choose the vacuum thickness of 18 Å in this paper and the long-range Coulomb interaction correction Ecorr can be safely neglected.

(a) Intrinsic defects on α-CsPbI3 (001) surface
The calculated formation energy of intrinsic defects on the cubic α-CsPbI3 (001) surface under two chemical potentials is shown in Fig. 4. The formation energy of interstitial defects on α-CsPbI3 (001) surface is relatively low. The donor defect with the lowest formation energy on α-CsPbI3 (001) surface is Csi, and the acceptor defects with the lowest formation energy are Ii and VCs. This is also the case for the bulk phase except for VPb and VI.35 The lower formation energy of Csi, Ii and VCs could be understood from the instability of α-CsPbI3, as the small size of Cs could not anchor the large Pb–I octahedron due to the small tolerance factor t18 – Cs, I find it easy to fill in the relatively large dodecahedral void in between the Pb–I octahedra (Csi, Ii), and Cs is also easily removed from the large dodecahedral void (VCs). According to Li et al.'s calculation in the α-CsPbI3 bulk phase,35 the formation energy of VPb and VI in the bulk phase is lowest, and even negative in almost the entire Fermi level range. Moreover, VPb is the only lowest formation energy defect under Pb-rich conditions. The negative formation energy of VPb and VI could also be characteristic of the instability of α-CsPbI3 bulk phase, in the sense that the constraint on Pb–I octahedra originating from the small size of Cs could be released and the dodecahedral void in between Pb–I octahedra could be reduced to fit the size of Cs. On the α-CsPbI3 (001) surface, the formation energy of VPb and VI increased significantly, and the negative formation energy no longer existed, which could be attributed to the surface Cs and Pb–I octahedron relaxation and distortion upon surface formation and bond breaking. Cs moves close to I and the average surface Cs–I bond length is reduced from 4.54 to 4.32 Å, and corresponding to the Cs–I bonding, the Pb–I octahedron accordingly undergoes large structural distortion with Pb off from the centre by 0.12 Å and the average Pb–I bond length increased from 3.21 Å to 3.25 Å. The reduced surface Cs–I bond length and the Pb–I octahedron distortion, stabilized the surface structure and especially enhanced the Pb–I binding, and thus increased the formation energy of VPb and VI. The increase of the formation energy of VPb and VI on α-CsPbI3 (001) reflects the relative stability of the α-CsPbI3 (001) surface, consistent with the experimental results that α-CsPbI3 nanoparticles are relatively stable,47 and in accordance with the surface phonon spectrum of α-CsPbI3 (001) reported by Yang et al.48 with phonon modes limited in the surface area and some Cs and Pb–I involved phonon modes enhanced stabilizing the structure. To verify the enhanced surface stability of α-CsPbI3 (001), we have also calculated the surface energy of α-CsPbI3 (001), which is slightly negative at −2.01 meV Å−2, and the negative surface energy indicates that the formation of α-CsPbI3 (001) surface indeed improves the phase stability of α-CsPbI3. We have also conducted the calculation for VPb and VI in α-CsPbI3 (taking neutral state as an example) with the HSE functional, and even though the formation energy with HSE is increased by around 0.5 eV, the formation energy of neutral VPb and VI on the surface is still larger than in the bulk, verifying the robustness against the functional employed. However, even though surface Cs–I bond length has been significantly reduced, the dodecahedral voids between the Pb–I octahedra remain large, and the formation energy of Csi, Ii and VCs on the α-CsPbI3 (001) surface is still low.

The slope of each segment indicates the charge on the defect. Kinks in the curves indicate thermodynamic transition levels between different charged states. The Fermi level range spans the bulk gap. 
(b) Intrinsic defects on γ-CsPbI3 (001) surface
The calculated formation energy of intrinsic defects on the orthorhombic γ-CsPbI3 (001) surface under two chemical potentials is shown in Fig. 5. On the surface of γ-CsPbI3 (001), interstitials Csi and Ii are no longer the defects with the lowest formation energy. The twisting of the octahedron in γ-CsPbI3 reduces the Cs–I bond length and the volume of the octahedral void, and the formation energy of interstitial defects are thus increased. Among all donor defects, the formation energy of substitution defect PbCs and vacancy VI is the lowest, and PbCs is easier to form and its formation energy is slightly lower than that of VI under Pb-rich condition, while the formation energy of PbCs is slightly higher than that of VI under Pb-poor conditions. Among all the acceptor defects, the formation energy of VCs is the lowest, and the formation energy of CsPb is comparatively low under Pb-poor conditions. The intrinsic defects are almost the same as those in the bulk phase, and the defects with the lowest formation energy in bulk phase are PbCs, VI (donor) and VPb, CsPb (acceptor). As can be seen, the only difference is that the formation energy of VPb on the γ-CsPbI3 (001) surface is slightly increased, and VCs turns out to be the acceptor defect with the lowest formation energy on the γ-CsPbI3 (001) surface. The increase of the formation energy of VPb on γ-CsPbI3 (001) could also be attributed to the distortion of the Pb–I octahedron. However, the magnitude of the distortion is smaller due to the already existing octahedron twisting in γ-CsPbI3, with Pb off center 0.1 Å, Pb–I bond length 3.22 to 3.24 Å, and Cs–I bond length 4.50 to 4.37 Å, and the increase of the formation energy of VPb is thus relatively small.

(c) Intrinsic defects on δ-CsPbI3 (001) surface
The calculated formation energy of intrinsic defects on the orthorhombic δ-CsPbI3 (001) surface under two chemical potentials are shown in Fig. 6. As can be seen, the formation energy of interstitial defects Csi and Ii is not always the lowest as in δ-CsPbI3, which could be attributed to the chainlike rearrangement of the Pb–I octahedron in δ-CsPbI3 which greatly reduces the Cs–I bond length (4.07 Å). However, as the coordination number for Cs has been simultaneously reduced from 12 to 9, the formation energy of Csi on δ-CsPbI3 (001) surface is actually relatively low, and even lowest under Pb-poor conditions, as the low coordination number leaves the interstitial Cs a large space to relax. VCs is also the lowest formation energy acceptor on the δ-CsPbI3 (001) surface. Actually, the formation energy of VCs is the lowest in all three phases, indicating that Cs ions in CsPbI3 are indeed flexible due to the small radius. The dominant effect of the Pb–I octahedron rearrangement is actually that it enhances the Pb–I binding, and the formation energy of VPb and VI is obviously increased. Another effect is that the surface defects of δ-CsPbI3 (001) are almost entirely the same as in the bulk, and this could be because the I–Pb bond is stable in the chainlike Pb–I octahedron and thus the octahedron on the δ-CsPbI3 (001) surface does not change much compared with the bulk phase. This is also the reason for the highest surface energy of δ-CsPbI3 (001) as aforementioned.

(d) Discussion of defect formation in the three phases under different conditions
As the chemical potential is lower for Pb/Cs and higher for I under Pb-poor conditions, the formation energy of defects rich in Pb/Cs or poor in I is relatively high under Pb-poor conditions, and vice versa for Pb/Cs-rich or I-poor defects. Furthermore, defects rich in Pb/Cs or poor in I tend to lose electrons due to the excess unpaired electrons, while defects rich in I or poor in Pb/Cs tend to gain electrons due to the unfilled I orbitals. Thus, the combined effect would be that formation energy for positively (negatively) charged defects tend to increase (decrease) under Pb-poor conditions. To be specific, CsPb (PbCs) are simultaneously Cs-rich and Pb-poor (Cs-poor and Pb-rich) defects. However, the chemical potential drop for Pb from A to C is larger than for Cs (in Section 3(a)), so the formation energy of CsPb decreases from point A to point C while the formation energy of PbCs increases. In addition, PbCs (CsPb) tends to form positively (negatively) charged defects, as Pb is of +2 valency and Cs is of +1 valency. Thus, the rule that formation energy for positively (negatively) charged defects tend to increase (decrease) under Pb-poor conditions apply for PbCs (CsPb) as well. As of this rule, the pinned Fermi level is closer to the VBM under Pb-poor conditions while closer to the CBM under Pb-rich conditions, leaving the intrinsic conductivity of CsPbI3 induced from the intrinsic defects tend to be p-type under Pb-poor conditions, while n-type under Pb-rich conditions. The pinned Fermi levels referenced to CBM/VBM are close to the case in the bulk; thus there's no significant band bending expected to contribute to the intrinsic defect formation. The calculated band gaps of the α-CsPbI3 (001), γ-CsPbI3 (001), and δ-CsPbI3 (001) films are 1.65, 1.92, and 2.56 eV, respectively, which are close to the band gaps of 1.46, 1.82, and 2.54 eV in the bulk phases as reported in the literature.34,35 Moreover, the corresponding work functions of the α-CsPbI3 (001), γ-CsPbI3 (001), and δ-CsPbI3 (001) films are 4.87, 4.75, and 5.68 eV respectively, which are converged within 0.1 eV as the thickness is further increased. Thus, the Fermi energy range spanned in Fig. 4–6 could be compared with that spanned in the bulk phase in ref. 34 and 35 within 0.1 eV up and down.
Summarizing the formation energy of three phases, the formation energy of Pb/I substitution defects (PbI, IPb), Cs/I substitution defects (CsI and ICs) and Pb interstitial defect Pbi is relatively high in three phases, while the formation energy of VCs is lowest in all three phases, and the sequence of Pb/Cs substitution defects PbCs, CsPb, interstitial defects Csi, Ii and vacancies VPb, VI is slightly different in different phases. The formation energy of most defects on the surface is similar to that in the bulk in all three phases except for VPb and VI. The formation energy of VPb and VI on α-CsPbI3 (001) surface is significantly increased due to the large relaxation and distortion of surface Cs and the Pb–I octahedron, thus the negative formation energy of VPb and VI is largely reduced. The formation energy of VPb on the γ-CsPbI3 (001) surface is also increased, and no longer the lowest. Indeed, this is in accordance with the experimental results that the stability of α-CsPbI3 and γ-CsPbI3 nanoparticles has been increased32,47,49 while the formation energy of Csi, Ii is correlated with the volumes of the interstitial void which are sensitive to the Pb–I octahedron twisting or rearrangement; thus, the formation energy of Csi, Ii is relatively high in γ-CsPbI3 and δ-CsPbI3 due to the reduced interstitial void by Pb–I octahedron twisting (γ-CsPbI3) and rearrangement (δ-CsPbI3). However, the formation energy of interstitial defects on α-CsPbI3 (001) surface is relatively low due to the remaining large dodecahedral void, even though the Pb–I octahedron distortion has largely enhanced the stability of the α-CsPbI3 (001) surface. The lower formation energy of the interstitial defects on the α-CsPbI3 (001) surface could be characteristic of the residual instability of α-CsPbI3 nanoparticles, which would still tend to transform to the δ-CsPbI3 phase after a certain time especially in a humid environment.42 Moreover, due to the reduced coordination number of Cs in δ-CsPbI3, the formation energy of Csi, Ii is higher in γ-CsPbI3 than in δ-CsPbI3, indicating that binding between Cs and Pb–I octahedron is stronger in γ-CsPbI3 than in δ-CsPbI3. Indeed, combined with the surface Cs and Pb–I octahedron relaxation, the stability of nanosized γ-CsPbI3 may be largely enhanced, and even higher than the stability of δ-CsPbI3, corresponding to the experimental results that nanosized γ-CsPbI3 could present endurable stability in an ambient atmosphere for several months.32,49 Moreover, the lowest formation energy of VCs due to the small radius of Cs indicates that Cs ions in CsPbI3 are indeed flexible in CsPbI3 and thus the mobile Cs ions in CsPbI3 are expected to play a role in the phase transformation of CsPbI3.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have systematically investigated twelve intrinsic defects on CsI-terminated α-CsPbI3, γ-CsPbI3, and δ-CsPbI3 (001) surfaces under both Pb-rich (point A) and Pb-poor (point C) conditions using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. The formation energy of most defects on the surface is similar to that in the bulk in all three phases except for VPb and VI. The formation energy of VPb and VI on α-CsPbI3 (001) surface is significantly increased and the negative formation energy of VPb and VI as in α-CsPbI3 bulk no longer exists, and the formation energy of VPb on the γ-CsPbI3 (001) surface is also increased, which could be attributed to the relaxation and distortion of surface Cs and the Pb–I octahedron, and in accordance with the experimental results that the stability of α-CsPbI3 and γ-CsPbI3 nanoparticles has been increased.32,47,49 However, the formation energy of interstitial defects on the α-CsPbI3 (001) surface is still lowest due to the remaining large dodecahedral void, which could be characteristic of the residual instability of α-CsPbI3 nanoparticles, as it has been found that α-CsPbI3 nanoparticles would still tend to transform to δ-CsPbI3 phase after a certain time especially in a humid environment.42 On the other hand, the formation energy of VCs is lowest in all three phases, indicating that Cs in CsPbI3 are indeed flexible in CsPbI3 due to the small radius and the mobile Cs ions in CsPbI3 are expected to play a role in the phase transformation of CsPbI3. Moreover, as the pinned Fermi level is closer to the VBM under Pb-poor conditions while closer to the CBM under Pb-rich conditions, the intrinsic conductivity of CsPbI3 induced from the intrinsic defects tends to be p-type under Pb-poor conditions, and n-type under Pb-rich conditions. Our research results are expected to provide support for the phase transition mechanism of CsPbI3 and provide a theoretical basis and guidance for improving the stability of the CsPbI3 all-inorganic halide perovskite.
