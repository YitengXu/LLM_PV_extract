    , Accepted 12th April 2013First published on 17th April 2013AbstractIn recent years, the electron-accepting diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) moiety has been receiving considerable attention for constructing donor–acceptor (D–A) type organic semiconductors for a variety of applications, particularly for organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Through association of the DPP unit with appropriate electron donating building blocks, the resulting D–A molecules interact strongly in the solid state through intermolecular D–A and π–π interactions, leading to highly ordered structures at the molecular and microscopic levels. The closely packed molecules and crystalline domains are beneficial for intermolecular and interdomain (or intergranular) charge transport. Furthermore, the energy levels can be readily adjusted, affording p-type, n-type, or ambipolar organic semiconductors with highly efficient charge transport properties in OTFTs. In the past few years, a number of DPP-based small molecular and polymeric semiconductors have been reported to show mobility close to or greater than 1 cm2 V−1 s−1. DPP-based polymer semiconductors have achieved record high mobility values for p-type (hole mobility: 10.5 cm2 V−1 s−1), n-type (electron mobility: 3 cm2 V−1 s−1), and ambipolar (hole/electron mobilities: 1.18/1.86 cm2 V−1 s−1) OTFTs among the known polymer semiconductors. Many DPP-based organic semiconductors have favourable energy levels and band gaps along with high hole mobility, which enable them as promising donor materials for OPVs. Power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of up to 6.05% were achieved for OPVs using DPP-based polymers, demonstrating their potential usefulness for the organic solar cell technology. This article provides an overview of the recent exciting progress made in DPP-containing polymers and small molecules that have shown high charge carrier mobility, around 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 or greater. It focuses on the structural design, optoelectronic properties, molecular organization, morphology, as well as performances in OTFTs and OPVs of these high mobility DPP-based materials.Yuning LiProf. Yuning Li is an associate professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering with affiliation to the Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology (WIN) at the University of Waterloo, Canada.

Broader context
Organic electronics, which include organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs), are expected to partly replace traditional silicon-based electronics and generate new applications in the near future. The biggest driving force behind the research into organic electronics is the notion that their manufacturing consumes much less energy and emits little or no harmful substances to the environment. Charge transport of organic semiconductors, the key components of organic electronics, is one of the most fundamental and critical parameters that determine the device performance. For years, low charge carrier mobility has been the hurdle that impedes commercialization of OTFTs. On the other hand, insufficient charge mobilities of donor and acceptor materials in OPVs can lead to charge recombination, resulting in poor power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells. Recently, a large number of new organic semiconductors containing the diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) building block, which show mobility similar to or higher than that of amorphous silicon, have been developed. In this paper, we discuss the structural design, optoelectronic properties, molecular organization, morphology, as well as performances of these promising materials for OTFTs and OPVs.

1 Introduction
Charge carrier transport in organic semiconductors is an important phenomenon in organic electronic devices such as organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs),1–3 organic thin film transistors (OTFTs),4–10 and organic photovoltaics (OPVs).11–15 It is considered that a mobility value comparable to or greater than that of amorphous silicon, which is ∼0.1 to 1 cm2 V−1 s−1, is needed for certain important applications such as displays and radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags. On the other hand, charge carrier mobilities in OPV devices need not be very high, but they have to be adequate so that the holes and electrons generated in the active layer can traverse to the anode and the cathode, respectively, before their recombination with opposite charge carriers. In addition, the hole and electron mobilities in the active layer of an OPV device are required to be well balanced in order to achieve high performance.11
Based on the charge carriers, organic semiconductors can be categorized into p-type, n-type, and ambipolar semiconductors, which are capable of transporting holes, electrons, and both holes and electrons, respectively. The type of an organic semiconductor in an OTFT device is primarily determined by its highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels with respect to the work function of the contact electrode material such as gold, silver, and aluminium. For a p-type organic semiconductor, a higher HOMO level than ∼−5.5 eV (relative to the vacuum level, which is 0 eV) is normally preferred for injecting and transporting the positively charged holes, but a HOMO level higher than −5.0 eV would result in susceptibility to oxidation of the semiconductor in air.8,16 On the other hand, a LUMO level of about −4.0 eV or lower is required for stable electron transport under ambient conditions.17,18 Organic semiconductors possessing a HOMO level higher than about −5.5 eV and a LUMO level lower than about −4.0 eV often exhibit pronounced ambipolar charge transport behaviour when a single source/drain contact material with a work function positioned between the HOMO and LUMO levels of the semiconductor is used. This is due to the relatively small and balanced injection barriers for both holes and electrons with respect to the source/drain contacts. Therefore, the band gap (ELUMO–EHOMO) of most ambipolar semiconductors is smaller than ∼1.5 eV. Electron donating building blocks (such as thiophene, furan, and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene) and functional groups (such as alkyl and alkoxy substituents) can raise the HOMO level, making the molecule a better hole transport material. On the other hand, electron accepting building blocks (such as benzothiadiazole and benzobisthiadiazole) and functional groups (such as cyano, dicyanomalonyl, and fluoro) can lower the LUMO level, making the molecule a more efficient electron transport material. When electron donating and electron accepting units are alternately arranged in a π-conjugated molecule, the HOMO level will be mainly determined by the electron donor unit and the LUMO level by the electron acceptor unit through molecular orbital hybridization. Therefore the organic molecules comprising donor and acceptor units, i.e., donor–acceptor (D–A) molecules, often have small band gaps,19 and thus are widely used as light harvesting materials or sensitizers for OPVs.12
In recent years, a number of electron acceptor building blocks have been explored to combine with common donor building blocks to form a library of D–A molecules for high efficiency OPVs12 and high mobility OTFTs.10 The high efficiency observed for OPVs using D–A molecules is ascribed, in large part, to their optimal band gaps (1.2–1.7 eV) and favourable HOMO/LUMO levels to match with the LUMO level of the acceptor materials (often fullerene derivatives).12 On the other hand, the highly efficient charge transport capability achieved for the D–A molecules in OTFTs is primarily due to the strong intermolecular interactions attained through the interchain D–A interaction. The strengthened intermolecular interactions can reduce the π–π stacking distance and increase the molecular self-assembly capability.10 Among electron acceptor building blocks, 1,4-diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole or diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) has attracted considerable attention in the past few years for the construction of a large number of high performance organic semiconductors for OLEDs, OTFTs, and OPVs (Fig. 1).10,20–23 The DPP unit can be readily prepared by association of two aromatic substituents at the 3 and 6 positions of DPP by using an aryl or heteroaryl carbonitrile (Ar-CN) and a succinic acid ester through the methodology established by Rochat, et al. in 1986 (Scheme 1).24 Some of the small molecular DPP-containing compounds such as Pigment 254 are well-known pigments or dyes. Substitution of the nitrogen atoms in the DPP unit with suitable groups such as alkyls can improve the solubility of the DPP molecules. When the aromatic substituents at the 3 and 6 positions are six-membered phenyl groups (DBP, Scheme 1), the DPP core has steric interactions with the adjacent phenyl groups, resulting in a twisted molecular geometry. While DBP-based small molecules and polymers have been studied as emitters for OLEDs,20 they are not very suitable as semiconductors for OTFTs due to their low charge carrier mobility. Instead, DPP building blocks with the DPP core sandwiched between two five-membered aromatic groups, or fused aromatic groups with a five-membered ring moiety adjacent to the DPP core, are more desirable since the steric hindrance can be alleviated to realize a highly coplanar molecular backbone. A coplanar molecular backbone is crucial for the extended delocalization of π-electrons along the backbone and for the formation of closely packed π–π stacks, which are attributed to the effective intramolecular charge transport (particularly important for polymers) and charge hopping through π-stacks, respectively. The five-membered ring-containing aromatic groups used to flank the DPP unit include thiophene, furan, selenophene, and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene, which form the DBT, DBF, DBS, and DBTT building blocks, respectively (Scheme 1).

There are several recent review articles on DPP materials with emphasis on various aspects.20–23 This article will focus on recent progress made in the development of DPP-containing polymers and small molecules that have shown high charge carrier mobility, around 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 and greater, as semiconductors in OTFTs and OPVs. A few DPP molecules with slightly lower mobility values are also included for the convenience of discussion. The optoelectronic properties and OTFT and OPV performances of the high mobility DPP-based compounds discussed in this article are summarized in Table 1.

2 DBT-based polymers
2.1 DBT homopolymers
DBT has the electron-accepting DPP core and two electron-donating thiophene units. Polymers with DBT as the repeat unit (i.e., DBT homopolymers) are the simplest DPP-based D–A polymers, which can be directly synthesized through the Yamamoto coupling reaction of dibromo functionalized DBT monomers (Scheme 2).25,26 When the substituents on the DPP core are straight alkyl chains, the resulting polymers are poorly soluble in any solvent because of the very strong intermolecular interactions.26 When substituted with long branched alkyl side chains such as 2-hexyldecyl or 2-octyldodecyl, polymers 1a and 1b showed moderate to good solubility in some solvents.261a and 1b exhibited very long wavelength absorption maxima (λmax’s) at 944 nm and 930 nm (both in the solid state) in their UV-Vis-NIR spectra, respectively, indicating their extended effective π-conjugation as well as the strong intramolecular donor–acceptor charge transfer effect. The optical band gaps for 1a and 1b are as small as ∼1.20 eV. The cyclic voltammetric (CV) measurements of 1a and 1b showed reversible and balanced oxidation reduction peaks. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of 1 were determined to be −5.4 eV and −4.2 eV, respectively. The rather low HOMO and LUMO energy levels are the result of the strong electron withdrawing effect of the DPP unit. Such HOMO and LUMO levels would facilitate ambipolar charge transport when a conductor with a suitable work function (ϕ) such as gold (ϕ = ∼4.5 to 5.1 eV)27,28 is used as the source/drain electrodes. When used as a channel semiconductor, ambipolar charge transport behaviour was indeed observed for both 1a and 1b. Well-balanced hole/electron mobilities of up to 0.024/0.056 cm2 V−1 s−1 were achieved for 1a. 1b showed slightly lower performance with hole/electron mobilities of 0.006/0.025 cm2 V−1 s−1. Both 1a and 1b showed poor crystallinity and random chain orientation, probably due to the steric interactions of the bulky side chains between adjacent repeat units.
 Scheme 2  Synthesis and structures of DBT homopolymers. 
Recently, Kanimozhi et al. reported a DBT–DBT type polymer 1c,29 which contains alternating straight and branched side chains, via Suzuki coupling polymerization. The straight triethylene glycol side chains were used to induce spontaneous chain crystallization. Grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) results show that the as-spun 1c film adopted a lamellar structure with a d-spacing of ∼2 nm (Fig. 2), whereby the π–π stacks of polymer main chains are spaced by the alkyl side chains.30 It was found that the polymer chains took an edge-on orientation, which is the most favoured packing motif for efficient charge transport in OTFTs.31 In bottom-gate–bottom-contact (gold) transistors, 1c exhibited ambipolar transport with balanced electron and hole mobilities of ∼0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1, similar to the values observed for 1a and 1b.26 Surprisingly, when used in top-gate–bottom-contact transistors with aluminium as the source and drain electrodes, 1c showed unipolar electron transport with mobility as high as ∼3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The observed high electron mobility in this device structure was attributed to the formation of a high-quality interface between the organic semiconductor and the fluoropolymer (CYTOP) dielectric layer. The use of low work function Al contacts would also help electron injection and suppress hole injection.

2.2 DBT copolymers with a non-fused electron donor moiety (Scheme 3)
To tune the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, band gap, crystallinity, and thin film morphology of the DBT-based polymers, a large number of π-conjugated moieties with ditin or diboronic acid (or ester) functionalities were used as monomers to make various copolymers with dibrominated DBT monomers via Stille or Suzuki coupling polymerizations. Scheme 3 shows the DBT-based copolymers with a non-fused conjugated electron donor moiety, which showed high mobilities.
 Scheme 3  Synthesis and structures of DBT-based copolymers with an additional non-fused donor moiety. 
The copolymer of DBT and thiophene, 2a, was first reported by Bijleveld et al., which exhibited ambipolar charge transport behaviour with hole/electron mobilities of 0.04/0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1.32 Recently Zhang et al. carried out a further detailed study on 2a.33 GIXRD patterns of the as-cast 2a film showed that the face-on backbone orientation31 was dominant. After thermal annealing, an increase in the edge-on population was observed. 2a showed unipolar p-type transport behaviour with a high hole mobility of up to 0.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 in top-gate–bottom-contact OTFTs with Au source and drain electrodes. The authors explained the significantly improved mobility values by the higher molecular weight (Mn = 104 kDa) of their polymer compared with the polymer (Mn = 54 kDa) reported by Bijleveld et al.32 When 2a was tested in bottom-gate–top-contact devices with low work function Ca as source/drain electrodes, an electron mobility of up to 1.2 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained. Based on the OTFT results obtained for 2a with 1b, it seems that incorporation of an additional electron-donating thiophene to the polymer backbone could somehow suppress the electron transport.
Lee et al. investigated the influence of the solubilising substituents of the DPP moiety on the OTFT performance by comparing 2a with 2b.342a having 2-octyldodecyl side chains showed ambipolar performance with a hole mobility of 0.14 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility of 0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the non-annealed thin films. When the polymer films were annealed at 150 °C, both hole and electron mobilities were increased significantly to 1.57 and 0.18 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (Fig. 3). On the other hand, hole/electron mobilities of 2b, having smaller 2-hexyldecyl side chains, improved to a lesser degree, from 0.11/0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the non-annealed thin films to 0.30/0.12 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the 150 °C annealed sample. The XRD results suggested that the longer branched alkyl side chains in 2a greatly helped to improve the crystallinity during thermal annealing (Fig. 3).

The inset shows the change in electron mobility. (b) The magnified (100) Bragg peaks of the XRD pattern. (c) The 2D GIXD patterns of 2a and 2b.34 
The HOMO and LUMO levels of 2a are −5.17 and −3.61 eV, respectively, which match well with those of the commonly used electron acceptor material, [6,6]-phenyl-C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), for bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer OPVs.32 The cell with a blend of 2a:PC71BM at a weight ratio of 1:2 provided an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.65 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 11.8 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.60, resulting in a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.7%.32
The first DPP-containing polymer for the OTFT application, 3a, was reported by Bürgi et al. in 2008.353a contains a branched chain substituted DBT and a straight chain substituted head-to-head bithiophene in the repeat unit. OTFT devices based on 3a displayed typical ambipolar charge transport performance. In bottom-gate–top-contact devices with Au source/drain electrodes, a hole mobility of up to 0.11 and an electron mobility of up to 0.05 cm2 V−1 s−1 were achieved. When a low work function metal, Ba, was used as source/drain contacts, more balanced hole/electron mobilities of up to 0.1/0.09 cm2 V−1 s−1 were reached. The multiple-chain substitution pattern and the presence of the head-to-head substituted bithiophene units provided good solubility to the polymer, but they also reduced the backbone coplanarity and crystallinity of the polymer.

3b with smaller 2-ethylhexyl substituents on DPP was used as a donor to blend with an electron acceptor, [6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) or PC71BM, to form an active layer for OPVs.36 It was found that when chloroform was used as a solvent, the 3b:PC61BM (1:2) blend film showed a very coarse surface morphology. The cells exhibited a high Voc of 0.78 eV, but a very low Jsc of 2.5 mA cm−2, resulting in a PCE of only 1.1%. However, the Jsc significantly improved to 9.4 mA cm−2 when a mixture solvent of chloroform and o-dichlorobenzene (DCB) was used, leading to a largely increased PCE of 3.2%. The presence of the high boiling point solvent, DCB, helped to improve the thin film morphology. The slow evaporation of DCB might allow for more ordered packing of polymer chains, resulting in the formation of the desirable nanophase separation of the donor and acceptor phases. The best cell performance with a PCE of 4% was achieved using PC71BM as an acceptor (Fig. 4). The improvement in PCE is mainly due to an increase in Jsc, which originated from the higher absorption-coefficient of PC71BM in the visible region than that of PC61BM.

Tsai et al. reported another DBT-bithiophene copolymer 4, which has 5-(2-ethyhexyl)thienyl on the bithiophene unit with an intention to extend the π-conjugation to the side chains.37 As a result, the band gap of 4 (1.29 eV) is slightly smaller than those of 3a and 3b (1.4–1.5 eV). The best hole mobility achieved was 0.115 cm2 V−1 s−1 in OTFT devices. Electron transport was observed, but the electron mobility (3.08 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) was two orders of magnitude lower than the hole mobility. The stronger electron-donating effect of the thienyl side chains raised the LUMO level, which would lead to poorer electron injection and transport properties. 4 was also evaluated as a donor material for OPVs. The best PCE was 2.43% achieved at a ratio of 4:PC71BM = 1:2. While the Voc (0.65 V) is similar to that of the cells with 3b, the lower Jsc (8.05 mA cm−2) and especially the rather low FF (0.46) caused the lower efficiency.
Copolymer 5, comprising a DBT and a non-substituted bithiophene in the repeat unit, was developed by Li et al.385 showed λmax’s at 777 and 790 nm in chloroform and in thin film, respectively. The optical band gap of 5 was estimated to be 1.2 eV. The longer λmax and smaller band gap of 5 compared with 3 and 4 indicated that 5 has a more coplanar backbone, which was attributed to the non-substitution of the bithiophene unit in 5. XRD results suggested that the non-annealed 5 thin films were highly crystalline with a preferential edge-on chain orientation (Fig. 5).

(e) and (f) 2D XRD pattern intensity graph and image obtained with the incident X-ray perpendicular to the thin film stack.38 
It was found that the molecular weight of 5 significantly influenced the thin film morphology. The AFM analysis clearly showed that the thin film of high molecular weight (HMW) 5 with Mn = 106 kDa comprised closely connected nanograins, while small pinholes were present in the thin film of the low molecular weight (LMW) polymer (Mn = 45.2 kDa) (Fig. 6). HMW 5 exhibited a high hole mobility of up to 0.89 cm2 V−1 s−1 in OTFTs without thermal annealing, which is very close to the maximum mobility of 0.97 cm2 V−1 s−1 achieved for the 100 °C annealed polymer thin films (Fig. 7). On the other hand, LMW 5 gave a much lower mobility of 0.35–0.39 cm2 V−1 s−1. It was found that the Mn of 5, measured using high-temperature gel-permeation chromatography (HT GPC) at 160 °C using 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB), is about 2–4 times lower than that measured at 40 °C using THF, suggesting 5 formed aggregates containing a few polymer chains at 40 °C. This might account for the spontaneous molecular organization of 5 after spin coating, leading to its high mobility without thermal annealing. The significantly improved charge transport property of 5 compared with 3a and 4 is likely due to the reduction or elimination of the steric interactions of the side chains on the neighbouring repeat units, which resulted in the high backbone coplanarity of 5.

OPVs with 5 as a donor and PC71BM as an acceptor were reported by Liu et al.39 Similar to the work reported by Wienk et al. on 3b, they found that increasing the amount of DCB in the DCB–chloroform mixture improved Jsc, but had little effect on Voc or FF. At an optimized solvent ratio of DCB:chloroform = 1:4, a very high PCE of 5.6% (Jsc = 14.84 mA cm−2; Voc = 0.63 V; FF = 0.60) was achieved.
The dramatic differences in mobility observed among 3, 4, and 5, which have the same conjugated backbone, indicate that the side chains have a profound impact on the charge transport properties. Since the side chains are electrically insulating, a native conjugated polymer without side chains would be, in theory, more desirable for highly efficient three-dimensional charge transport. Sun et al. designed and synthesized polymer 6, which has 2-octyldecanoyl substituents on the DPP units, differing from polymer 5 only in side chains. The side chains of 6 could be readily removed at 200 °C to form polymer 7, which was supported by the TGA and FT-IR data.40 The absence of insulating side chains in 7 was expected to allow the formation of three-dimensional conjugated polymer networks (Fig. 8). The as-spun and 150 °C annealed thin films showed a primary diffraction peak at θ = 4.4°, suggesting that the polymer chains in 6 adopted a lamellar crystalline structure with a d-spacing of 2.01 nm separated by the side chains. When the annealing temperature was increased to 200 °C, the primary peak disappeared due to the loss of the side chains. The featureless XRD pattern and the increased hump in the 2θ range of 20–30° indicate that the 200 °C annealed thin film was rather amorphous. Polymer 6 showed a hole mobility of 0.096 cm2 V−1 s−1 in OTFT devices, while the side chain-free polymer 7 exhibited a slightly lower hole mobility of 0.078 cm2 V−1 s−1. The lower mobility values observed for 6 and 7 than that of 5 could be attributed to the poorer crystallinity and morphology of these two polymers (Fig. 8).

Since selenium generally has a stronger heteroaromatic interaction than sulphur does, it would be interesting to investigate the effect of selenium on the electron distribution and charge transport of DPP-containing polymers. Lin et al. reported 8, a structural analogue of 2a, using selenophene instead of thiophene to link the DBT units.41 The absorption peaks for 8 in solution and thin film are 798 and 849 nm, respectively, which appear to be similar to those of 2a. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of 8 are −5.09 eV/−3.46 eV, which are higher than the respective values of 2a, resulting from the stronger electron-donating effect of selenophene than thiophene. OTFT devices based on 8 exhibited ambipolar charge transport features. The best hole/electron mobilities are up to 1.62/0.14 cm2 V−1 s−1, similar to the performance of 2a obtained by Lee et al.34
Ha et al. synthesized and studied polymer 9, consisting of DBT and biselenophene, in comparison with its bithiophene analogue polymer 5.42 The UV-Vis-NIR spectra of 9 red-shifted compared with 5 in both solution and solid state, which is due to the longer effective conjugation length and the electron-rich nature of selenophene. Similar to 5, 9 also formed a lamellar crystalline structure with a predominant edge-on chain orientation. 9 showed a hole mobility of up to 1.5 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is better than the highest mobility of 1.04 cm2 V−1 s−1 obtained for 5. The improved mobility of 9 was explained by its better solubility and the slightly denser chain packing compared with 5. However, the more electron-donating nature and the large size of selenophene might extend the main chain conjugation and increase the intermolecular π–π overlap, resulting in the improved charge transport performance of 9.
A simple copolymer of DBT with phenylene, 10, was reported by Bijleveld et al.4310 has a lower HOMO (−5.35 eV) and a higher LUMO (−3.53 eV) than those (HOMO: −5.2 to −5.3 eV and LUMO: −3.6 to −4.0 eV) of DBT-thiophene copolymers 2a and 2b. The shifts in the HOMO and LUMO levels of 10 compared to 2 are due to the weaker electron donating nature of phenylene than thiophene, which leads to less effective intramolecular charge transfer. Similar to 2, 10 showed ambipolar charge transport characteristics, but its hole/electron mobilities of 0.04 ± 0.01/0.02 ± 0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1 are much lower than those of 2. The blend of 10 with PC71BM in OPV devices showed an impressive PCE of 5.5% (Jsc = 10.8 mA cm−2; Voc = 0.80 V; FF = 0.65). The higher Voc of the OPV devices based on 10 compared with that (0.65 V) of the devices based on 2a (ref. 32) is mainly due to the lower HOMO level of 10.
Yuen et al. placed two additional 3-dodecylthiophene units to the two sides of the phenylene unit.44 The resulting copolymer 11a has an optical band gap of 1.5 eV with a HOMO of −4.7 eV and a LUMO of −3.2 eV. Differing from 10, polymer 11a exhibited unipolar OTFT performance with hole mobility as high as 0.27 cm2 V−1 s−1. The electron donating effects of 3-dodecylthiophene units are likely to be responsible for the absence of the electron transport behaviour of 11a. Similar to 11a, 11b–d45 also bear two additional 3-dodecylthiophene units to flank the central unsubstituted aromatic units, but the positions of the dodecyl substituents are different from that in 11a. The steric interactions of the dodecyl side chains with the central phenylene would cause the twisting of the polymer main chain of 11b, resulting in a larger band gap (1.74 eV) than that of 11a (1.5 eV). OTFTs with 11b, 11c, and 11d showed ambipolar charge-transport characteristics with low hole mobility of ∼10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 and electron mobility of ∼10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. On the other hand, OPVs based on the blends of 11b, 11c, and 11d with PC71BM at a 1:2 ratio showed high PCEs of 5.5%, 5.8%, and 5.2%, respectively. The Jsc of 16.4 mA cm−2 reached by 11c is the highest value reported so far for DPP-based polymers. This high Jsc was attributed to the high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices based on 11c, which originates from the higher LUMO offset energy (0.65 eV) between 11c and PC71BM compared with other DPP-based donor polymers such as 2b (0.42 eV), 10 (0.50 eV), 11b (0.63 eV), and 11d (0.61 eV). The higher offset energy of 11c increases the driving force for charge generation to improve photocurrent. Compared with 11b and 11d, 11c has a smaller band gap and is able to harvest more photons, leading to a further increase in the photocurrent. The differences in the LUMO levels and band gaps among these DPP polymers are mainly caused by their different contents of the electron-donating thiophene units.
Wu et al. introduced a vinylene unit in 12 to link the DBT units.46 XRD patterns of thin films of 12 showed a sharp diffraction peak at 4.78°, corresponding to an inter-lamellar layer distance of 1.847 nm. The broad band centred at 22.67° is related to the π–π stacking distance of 0.392 nm. Ambipolar transport performance with a hole mobility of 0.17 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility of 0.017 cm2 V−1 s−1 was achieved in bottom-gate–bottom-contact OTFTs. Complementary inverters with integrated OTFTs with 12 demonstrated sharp switching characteristics with an output voltage gain up to 27. When four electron-donating thiophene units, along with a vinylene unit in the centre were incorporated, the resulting polymer 13 showed unipolar p-type semiconductor performance with a hole mobility of up to 0.05 cm2 V−1 s−1.47 OPV devices using a blend of 13:PC71BM (1:2) exhibited a PCE of 1.94%. The poor OTFT and OPV performances might be due to the low molecular weight (Mn = 8300) of 13.
Interestingly, copolymers 14a and 14b48 having DBT and non-substituted thiophene-vinylene-thiophene (TVT) exhibited dramatically different performance in OTFTs in comparison with 12 and 13. The HOMO energy levels of 14a and 14b are −5.28 eV and −5.30 eV, respectively, which are lower than that of 13 (−4.80 eV) due to the absence of two 3-dodecylthiophene units in 14. Interestingly, their HOMO levels are also lower than that of 12 (−5.14 eV), which might be the result of their broadened band gaps. In OTFTs, 14a and 14b exhibited exceptionally high hole mobilities of 2.0–4.5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.0–8.2 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (Fig. 9).

The interlayer and π–π stacking distances calculated from the XRD results for polymer 14a are 1.944 nm and 0.372 nm, respectively, whereas for polymer 14b, the π–π stacking distance is reduced to 0.366 nm and the interlayer distance is slightly larger at ∼2.111 nm. The fact that 14b exhibited a higher hole mobility than polymer 14a was correlated with the shorter π–π stacking distance of the former. Similar to the observations for 2a and 2b, it is proven again that a longer side chain helps to improve molecular ordering probably due to the easier polymer chain motion. AFM images of these two polymers showed highly uniform and intertwined polymer fibres (Fig. 10). Such morphology was considered to be favourable for efficient charge transport.

2.3 DBT copolymers with a fused electron donor moiety (Scheme 4)
Incorporation of a fused-ring donor moiety into the backbone of a DBT-based polymer was envisioned to increase the π–π overlap area and to further strengthen the intermolecular interactions. Based on this consideration, Li et al. designed a copolymer 15a comprising a DBT and a thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) in the repeat unit.4915a showed the λmax at 810 nm in chloroform and 825 nm in the solid state slightly red-shifted compared with polymer 5, which has a bithiophene instead of a thieno[3,2-b]thiophene. The HOMO level of 15a (−5.25 eV) is very close to that of 5.

2D XRD measurements revealed that 15a formed a lamellar crystalline structure in the thin film with an interlayer distance of ∼2.04 nm and a small π–π stacking distance of 0.371 nm (Fig. 11), marginally shorter than that (0.375 nm) of 5. By comparing the 2D XRD and thin film XRD results, it is apparent that the polymer chains took a preferential edge-on lamellar packing pattern in the spin-coated thin films (Fig. 12). A hole mobility of 0.94 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the films annealed at 200 °C was achieved (Fig. 13), which is similar to the performance obtained for 5. AFM images showed that the thin films consisted of large intertwined bundles of polymer fibres of ∼400 nm in width (Fig. 12). In addition to the short π–π stacking distance, which facilitated the charge interchain hopping, the tightly packed polymer chain network might establish efficient pathways for the intergranular charge transport.

A later study by Chen et al. found that 15a could exhibit ambipolar transport performance under certain device fabrication conditions.50 Much higher electron mobility was achieved at a high annealing temperature of 320 °C due to the effective removal of electron-traps from the polymer. They also found that OTFT devices with O2-plasma treated gold source/drain electrodes showed much lower electron mobility than the ones without an O2-plasma treatment. It was likely due to the fact that O2-plasma treated gold has a higher work function (∼5.0 to 5.5 eV) than non-treated gold (∼4.7 to 4.9 eV). The increased work function of the O2-plasma treated gold would build up an energy barrier for electron injection from gold to the semiconductor. The best ambipolar performance with hole/electron mobilities of 1.18/1.86 cm2 V−1 s−1 was achieved for devices using polymer films annealed at 320 °C and gold electrodes without an O2-plasma treatment.
Recently Lee et al. studied the influence of side chain substitution on the properties of 15a and 15b.34 It was found that 15a with longer side chains (2-octyldodecyl groups) has higher crystallinity and a more homogeneous surface morphology in thin films compared with 15b, which has shorter side chains (2-hexyldecyl groups). Both polymers showed ambipolar charge transport performance in OTFTs. 15b showed hole/electron mobilities of 0.79/0.04 cm2 V−1 s−1, while 15a showed much higher average hole/electron mobilities of 1.93/0.06 cm2 V−1 s−1. The results obtained for polymers 2, 14, as well as 15 clearly indicate that longer side chains are beneficial for achieving improved molecular organization and charge transport. This opposing trend to that observed for polymer 1 is probably due to the existence of a spacer between two DBT units in these polymers that can accommodate bulkier side chains to maintain the backbone coplanarity. Interestingly, 15a has slightly lower HOMO/LUMO levels (−5.5 eV/−4.3 eV) than those (−5.3 eV/−4.0 eV) of 15b, which was explained by the better crystallinity of the former.
By optimizing the type of catalyst, reaction temperature, and work-up procedure, Li et al. obtained 15a with a very high Mn value of ∼110 kDa measured using high-temperature GPC at 160 °C.51 With such a high molecular weight, the π–π stacking distance was found to be reduced to 0.343 nm, which is much shorter than the previously reported value of 0.371 nm.45 The polymer was tested in bottom-gate–top-contact and bottom-gate–bottom-contact OTFTs on silicon wafer or PET substrates. All devices showed unipolar p-channel charge transport performance. Hole mobility as high as 10.5 cm2 V−1 s−1 was achieved, which is the record mobility value reported for polymer based OTFTs so far (Fig. 14). Similar to the previous observation for polymer 5,3415a showed a strong tendency to form aggregates in solvents, which was also proven by comparing the Mn values obtained with GPC at 40 and 160 °C. In addition, the mobility of 15a exhibited a strong dependence on molecular weight, similar to the phenomenon observed for 5.38 The improvements in mobility were up to one order of magnitude for the higher molecular weight polymer compared to the lower molecular weight one. The much higher mobility achieved by this group compared with the values reported previously by other groups34,49,50 might be ascribed to the combined effects of the higher molecular weight of the polymer and the improved device fabrication process (e.g., the different dielectric surface passivation method and the higher boiling solvent used for dissolving the polymer). OTFTs based on 15a showed good environmental stability with only slight changes in mobility and current on/off ratio after the devices were stored for over one year. PMOS inverters fabricated using 15a achieved a high voltage gain up to 92.

Zhang et al. evaluated 15a as a donor for OPVs using PC71BM as an electron acceptor.52 At a 15a:PC71BM ratio of 1:2, and with 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as a solvent additive, the best PCE was only 1.6%. 15b also showed poor OPV performance with a PCE of 1.2%.53 The poor OPV performance of 15a and 15b was mainly due to their low Jsc’s. An offset energy of 0.3–0.4 eV between the LUMO levels of the donor and acceptor is considered the minimum for optimal exciton dissociation.54–56 However, the LUMO–LUMO offset energy between 15 and PC71BM (and PC61BM) is only 0.24 eV, which might be responsible for the poor charge separation and thus low Jsc’s.
Bijleveld et al. reported another DBT–TT copolymer 16 with side chain substitution on both DBT and TT, and compared this polymer with 15b, which has no substitution on the TT unit.5316 has an optical band gap of 1.33 eV, which is close to that (1.31 eV) of 15b. 16 showed ambipolar characteristics with lower hole/electron mobilities (0.01/0.002 cm2 V−1 s−1) than those (0.03/0.009 cm2 V−1 s−1) of 15b. It should be noted that the mobilities obtained for 15b by this group are about one order of magnitude lower than the values reported by Lee et al.34 OPV devices with 16 and PC61BM at a ratio of 1:2 showed a moderate PCE of 2.3% (Jsc = 6.0 mA cm−2; Voc = 0.68 V; FF = 0.59), better than that of the devices based on 15b (PCE = 1.2%). The alkyl substituted TT is more electron-donating than the non-substituted TT, which slightly raised the LUMO level of 16 and consequently increased the LUMO–LUMO offset between 16 and PC61BM. As discussed with regard to 11c, this enlarged offset energy would facilitate the charge separation, leading to notably enhanced EQE and Jsc of the 16-based devices.
Polymer 17 composed of a DBT and a larger fused ring moiety, dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene (DTT),57 was expected to exhibit even stronger intermolecular interactions due to the larger π-orbital overlapping between the polymer chains. 17 showed a λmax at 802 nm in both solution and thin film, which is slightly shorter than those of DBT-TT copolymer 15a. The XRD data of 17 indicated that the thin films were highly crystalline and the polymer chains also formed a lamellar structure with an edge-on stacking motif on the substrate. A high hole mobility of up to 0.75 cm2 V−1 s−1 was achieved for 17 in bottom-gate–top-contact OTFT devices. OPV devices with 17:PC71BM (1:1.5) deposited using a mixture solvent of chloroform and DCB showed a PCE of 4.42% (Jsc = 13.4 mA cm−2; Voc = 0.62 V; FF = 0.555). Compared with the DBT-TT based polymer 15a, OPV devices using 17 gave a much higher Jsc. This is probably due to the slightly larger LUMO level difference (0.3 eV) between 17 and PC71BM, which is just sufficient for charge separation. When a small amount (2.5 vol%) of DIO was added to the mixture solvent, the PCE improved up to 6.05% (Jsc = 13.7 mA cm−2; Voc = 0.66 V; FF = 0.661) (Fig. 15). It was found that the space charge limited current (SCLC) hole mobility was 5.33 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the active layer cast from the mixture of chloroform–DCB–DIO, higher than those (1.68 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.39 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) of the active layers cast from chloroform and chloroform–DCB. These results indicated that the active layer was able to form an interconnected network more effectively when DIO was added to the solvent.

An independent study on polymer 17 by Shahid et al. demonstrated that 17 functioned as an ambipolar semiconductor in top-gate–bottom-contact OTFT devices.58 The observed electron transport could be due to the better protection of the active layer in the top-gate devices than in the bottom-gate ones. The highest hole and electron mobilities are 0.23 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.015 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The hole mobility is lower than the value (∼0.75 cm2 V−1 s−1) reported by Jung et al.,57 which might be related to the different surface passivation treatments and the different processing solvents used. They also used 17 as the donor and PC71BM as the acceptor in OPV devices. The best PCE achieved was 5.10% for a device with a 17:PC71BM ratio of 1:2 using a mixture solvent of chloroform and DCB (4:1). The PCE is better than the one (PCE = 4.42%) obtained by Jung et al. without adding DIO to the solvent.57
Sonar et al. used a simple fused ring aromatic structure, naphthalene, to form polymer 18 with DBT.5918 has a wider band gap of 1.50 eV than that of 15a,45 which is due to the weaker electron-donating effect of naphthalene than thieno[3,2-b]thiophene. The π–π stacking distance in 18 (0.382 nm) is also larger than that (0.371 nm) of 15a, indicating the weaker intermolecular interactions of 18. The highest hole mobility of 0.98 cm2 V−1 s−1 was achieved in a dual gate (Fig. 16)59 and in a top-gate OTFT configuration.60 When 18:PC71BM (1:2) was used as the active layer in OPV devices, a high PCE of 4.7% (Jsc = 11.8 mA cm−2; Voc = 0.76 V; FF = 0.52) was achieved.59 Compared to 15a, 18 has a higher LUMO level (−3.79 eV), which can promote efficient charge separation in the 18:PC71BM blend layer to yield a much higher Jsc.

Polymer 19a comprising DBT and carbazole showed a notable blue-shift in absorption (λmax = 680 nm) compared to 15a and 18, indicating its less effective conjugation.61 The HOMO and LUMO levels obtained from the CV measurements were −5.44 eV and −3.92 eV, respectively. In OTFT devices, 19a showed low hole mobility of ∼0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1. OPV devices using a blend of 19a:PC61BM (1:2) gave a high Voc of 0.85 V, which is due to the low lying HOMO level of 19a, while Jsc (= 5.2 mA cm−2) and FF (= 0.37) were low, which was believed to be a result of the poor morphology of the active layer. The overall PCE of 1.6% is therefore quite low. A subsequent investigation of 19a by the same group improved the PCE to 3.2% (Jsc = 8.6 mA cm−2; Voc = 0.80 V; FF = 0.47) by using PC71BM, instead of PC61BM, as the acceptor.62
A later study of 19a by Jo et al. showed a similar PCE of 3.28% using 19a:PC71BM (1:3) with a solvent additive, 1-chloronaphthalene.63 They also evaluated a similar polymer 19b with longer 2-octyldodecyl side chains, which showed a slightly better PCE of 3.64% without a solvent additive. It seems that longer side chains helped the formation of more interconnected thin film networks. The highest performance for the devices based on 19b was obtained by using a TiOx interlayer between the photoactive layer and the Al cathode, reaching a PCE of 3.80%.
Polymer 20a, having an electron-rich dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP), showed the λmax at 860 nm, much red-shifted compared with the carbozole-derived 19, which is due to the stronger electron donating capability of dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole than that of carbazole.64 The optical band gap of 20a is 1.15 eV, markedly narrower than that (1.57 eV) of 19a.61 The HOMO level obtained from the thin film CV measurements is −5.20 eV. The π–π stacking distance of the crystalline 20a thin films is quite short at 0.37 nm, which was determined using the grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) technique. OTFT devices based on 20a showed a moderate mobility of up to 0.41 cm2 V−1 s−1.
Zhou et al. reported a similar polymer 20b that has hyperbranched side chains on DTP.65 The hole mobility of 20b was measured to be 0.05 cm2 V−1 s−1. The much lower mobility of 20b than that of 20a is likely caused by its less ordered molecular packing due to the bulkier side chains. OPV devices with a 20b:PC71BM (1:2) active layer showed a very high Jsc of 14.87 mA cm−2. However the overall PCE (2.71%) was not high, resulting from the low Voc (0.38 V) and FF (0.48). The relatively high HOMO level (−4.90 eV) of 20b might be responsible for the low Voc. It should be noted that the HOMO level reported in this study has a large discrepancy from the value (−5.20 eV) reported for 20a,64 which has the same backbone structure. It is unclear whether this difference originates from the influence of side chains or is due to different conditions for the CV measurements by the two groups.
Ashraf et al. used silaindacenodithiophene (SiIDT) as a novel fused coplanar block to synthesize polymer 21.66 The long Si–C bond was believed to increase the separation between antibonding lobes of the aryl units on the silaindacenodithiophene, which would result in a lower HOMO level. Additionally, the presence of a silole group in the conjugated backbone would cause in-phase mixing of the σ* orbital of the silylene and the π* orbital of the conjugated units. Therefore a more stable (or lower) LUMO level would be expected to facilitate electron transport. The HOMO level of 21 measured with photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA) is −5.1 eV, whereas the LUMO level calculated from the HOMO level and the optical band gap is −3.7 eV. The 180 °C annealed thin film exhibited ambipolar behaviour in OTFTs with the highest hole/electron mobilities of 0.65/0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1, while OPV devices with a blend of 21:PC71BM (1:2 w/w) showed a PCE of only 1.4% (Jsc = 3.53 mA cm−2; Voc = 0.63 V; FF = 0.65). The rather low PCE is mainly due to the poor Jsc, which was attributed to the low LUMO–LUMO offset energy of 21 with PC71BM (<0.3 eV). It seems that the use of SiIDT brought the LUMO of the polymer to a level that is too low for matching with that of PC71BM.
A similar polymer 22a containing indacenodithiophene (IDT) was reported by Wang et al.67 Its HOMO level (−5.32 eV) is lower than that of 21, while its LUMO level (−3.73 eV) is very close to that of 21. 22a showed a rather low hole mobility of 0.065 cm2 V−1 s−1 in OTFT devices. OPV devices with 22a:PC71BM (1:1 w/w) showed a PCE of 1.76% (Jsc = 3.66 mA cm−2; Voc = 0.88 V; FF = 0.54). The low Jsc was also attributed to the low LUMO–LUMO offset (0.18 eV) between 22a and PC71BM.
Two other DBT-IDT polymers 22b and 22c, which have different substituents on DPP and IDT, showed even lower hole mobilities of 0.015 and 0.011 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.68 The lower mobility values than that of 22a are probably due to the poorer molecular ordering caused by the 4-hexylphenyl substituents on the IDT units in 22b and 22c. A low PCE of 0.95% (Jsc = 2.63 mA cm−2; Voc = 0.77 V; FF = 0.47) was obtained for the devices based on 22b:PC71BM (1:3), while a much higher PCE of 3.67% (Jsc = 9.80 mA cm−2; Voc = 0.76 V; FF = 0.49) was achieved for 22c:PC71BM (1:3). The much higher Jsc of 22c based devices was interpreted as the higher surface energy (34.8 mN m−1) of 22c than that (30.2 mN m−1) of 22b, which is most likely due to the presence of the CN groups in 22c. A relatively smooth 22c:PC71BM thin film was obtained due to the similar surface energy of 22c to that (34.3 mN m−1) of PC71BM, providing improved D–A interfaces for better charge separation.

23, containing DBT and anthracene, which are linked by ethynylene, was synthesized by Lee et al. via the Sonogashira coupling reaction.69 The optical band gap of 23 is 1.4 eV, while the HOMO and LUMO levels determined from the CV data are −5.46 eV and −3.65 eV, respectively. The GIWAXS measurements indicated the amorphous structure of both the as-spun and annealed 23 films. 23 exhibited a mobility of up to 0.12 cm2 V−1 s−1 in OTFTs. Incorporation of a larger anthradithiophene unit into polymer 24 could improve the crystallinity of the polymer thin films.70 However, the hole mobility achieved for 24 (0.12 cm2 V−1 s−1) remained similar to that of 23.
2.4 DBT copolymers containing an additional electron acceptor moiety (Scheme 5)
The DBT unit comprises a DPP acceptor core sandwiched between two thiophene donor units. Since polymer 1, which is a homopolymer of DBT, exhibited ambipolar charge transport characteristics, improved electron transport performance might be obtained if an additional acceptor unit is incorporated.
 Scheme 5  Structures of DBT-based copolymers with an additional electron acceptor moiety (A). 
Sonar et al. used the well-known electron accepting benzothiadiazole and DBT to form polymer 25a.71 This polymer has a low optical band gap of ∼1.2 eV. The HOMO and LUMO levels of 25a are −5.2 eV and −4.0 eV, respectively, which are higher than those of polymer 1 (−5.4 eV and −4.2 eV). Therefore, it seems that benzothiadiazole is a weaker electron acceptor than DPP (see following discussions on 26). After thermal annealing, the polymer films showed improved crystallinity and formed a lamellar structure with an interlayer distance of 2.13 nm (Fig. 17). 2D XRD results revealed that the polymer chains adopted an edge-on orientation on SiO2/Si substrates. The highest hole/electron mobilities of 0.35/0.40 cm2 V−1 s−1 were obtained for a bottom-gate–top-contact device using a 200 °C annealed polymer thin film (Fig. 18). AFM images showed that the 200 °C annealed film was composed of tightly packed nanofibers, while in the non-annealed film amorphous regions were seen (Fig. 17), which agrees well with the observed crystallinity trend. When used in top-gate–bottom-contact devices, 25a showed improved hole/electron mobilities of up to 0.53/0.58 cm2 V−1 s−1.72

25b, which has a longer side chain (2-dodecyltetradecyl), was later reported by Cho et al.73 OTFT devices with 25 showed hole/electron mobilities of 0.097/0.089 cm2 V−1 s−1 using gold as the source contact and aluminium as the drain contact for easy injection of holes and electrons, respectively. AFM and XRD showed that the thin films of 25b were amorphous, which might explain the lower mobilities of this polymer than that of 25a. The benzothiadiazole spacer is probably unable to accommodate the very bulky side chains in 25b, resulting in the twisted backbone structure and the disordered chain packing.
Yuen et al. synthesized a series of polymers 11a, 26 and 27 to systematically study the effects of benzene, benzothiadiazole, and benzobisthiadiazole on the optoelectronic properties of these polymers.44 The band gap decreased from 1.5 eV for 11a, to 1.35 eV for 26 and 0.65 eV for 27 with increasing electron-accepting strength in the order of benzene, benzothiadiazole, and benzobisthiadiazole. The HOMO/LUMO levels of 26 are −4.75 eV/−3.4 eV, slightly lower than those (−4.70 eV/−3.2 eV) of 11a. On the other hand, 27 has a much higher HOMO of −4.55 eV and a much lower LUMO of −3.9 eV. The authors explained the observed energy levels by the roles of benzothiadiazole and benzobisthiadiazole in 26 and 27. Since benzothiadiazole is weakly electron-accepting with respect to the DPP unit, the role of acceptor is played by DPP in 26. In contrast, in polymer 27, the strongly electron-accepting benzobisthiadiazole is the acceptor. XRD results showed that 11a took a face-on chain orientation whereas 26 and 27 preferred an edge-on orientation. In bottom-gate–bottom-contact OTFT devices, 26 exhibited unipolar p-type characteristics with a hole mobility of up to 0.23 cm2 V−1 s−1 despite incorporation of the electron withdrawing benzothiadiazole. The benzobisthiadiazole-based polymer 27a that has 3-hexylthiophene units exhibited ambipolar transport performance with high hole/electron mobilities of 0.83/1.36 cm2 V−1 s−1, whereas 27b that has 3-dodecylthiophene units showed similar electron mobility (1.32 cm2 V−1 s−1), but a higher hole mobility (1.17 cm2 V−1 s−1). The high mobilities observed for 27 were considered to be due to the stronger interchain interactions between the donor and acceptor blocks and the sulphur–nitrogen (S–N) intermolecular contact effects of benzobisthiadiazole.
Hong et al. synthesized 28 with an azine linkage in the repeat unit through the very simple catalyst-free condensation reaction of a dialdehyde functionalized DBT monomer with hydrazine.7428 showed the λmax at 789 nm in thin film with an optical band gap of 1.43 eV. The HOMO and LUMO levels of 28 are −5.67 eV and −4.24 eV, respectively, indicating that the azine moiety is a very strong electron acceptor. This polymer exhibited ambipolar charge transfer properties with well-balanced hole/electron mobilities of 0.36/0.41 cm2 V−1 s−1.
Mohebbi et al. chose emeraldicene (EMD) as an additional fused-ring acceptor unit to synthesize polymer 29.75 Interestingly, the HOMO and LUMO levels of 29 determined by CV are −4.65/−3.50 eV, which are very high. The role of EMD in this polymer is probably a donor with respect to DPP, similar to benzothiadiazole in 26. Therefore EMD and DPP may have strong intra- and intermolecular D–A interactions, leading to a very narrow band gap (<1 eV). The large EMD units made the polymer chain motion difficult and high crystallinity could only be achieved at a very high annealing temperature of 320 °C. OTFTs using 320 °C annealed thin films of 29 showed ambipolar transport performance with hole/electron mobilities of 0.29/0.25 cm2 V−1 s−1.
3 DBF, DBS, and DBTT-based polymers (Scheme 6)
DBT is the most widely investigated moiety in DPP-based polymers so far. Several research groups have also been investigating other DPP building blocks, which have the DPP core flanked by furan (DBF), selenophene (DBS), and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene units (DBTT) (Scheme 6). Incorporation of these building blocks was expected to bring about new optoelectronic properties due to their different electronic structures and geometries compared with DBT.
 Scheme 6  Structures of DBF, DBS, and DBTT-based polymers. 
DBF based polymer 30,76 a structural analogue of DBT based polymer 5, showed a larger band gap (1.41 eV), a lower HOMO level (−5.32 eV), and a higher LUMO level (−3.91 eV) than those of 5. This is probably due to the reduced aromaticity of furan compared with thiophene.77 XRD measurements indicated that the as-spun thin film of 30 was almost amorphous (Fig. 19). The crystallinity of the thin film improved after thermal annealing (100–220 °C), but the polymer chains in the crystalline phase seemed to be randomly oriented. This assumption was made based on the close similarity of the 2D XRD patterns obtained on polymer thin films with incident X-ray parallel (Fig. 19b) and normal (Fig. 19c) to the substrate, since the films with preferential chain orientation would show significantly different diffraction patterns using parallel and normal X-rays (see Fig. 5 and 11). Hole mobility as high as 1.54 cm2 V−1 s−1 was unexpectedly achieved for the OTFT device with the 200 °C annealed polymer films (Fig. 20). This mobility value is very high considering the poor crystallinity and the random chain orientation of the crystalline domain of the polymer thin films. The results demonstrated that DBF is a promising building block for high performance polymers for OTFTs.

Subsequently, Li et al. reported another DBF polymer 31 containing thieno[3,2-b]thiophene,78 which is similar to the DBT polymer 15a. 31 has a band gap of 1.39 eV, which is larger than that (1.23 eV) of 15a. XRD data indicated that the polymer chains in the spin-coated thin films predominantly adopted an edge-on chain orientation. OTFTs based on 31 without thermal annealing exhibited a hole mobility of 0.34 cm2 V−1 s−1. When the polymer thin films were annealed at 200 °C, the devices showed the highest hole mobility of 0.53 cm2 V−1 s−1. The mobility values of 31 are lower than the values (up to ∼0.94 cm2 V−1 s−1) achieved by its DBT counterpart 15a. OPV devices with a 31:PC71BM ratio of 1:2 gave a PCE of 4.38% (Jsc = 10.8 mA cm−2; Voc = 0.687 V; FF = 0.592). The overall OPV performance of 31 is much better than that of 15a, which might be due to its lower HOMO level (a higher Voc), higher LUMO level (a higher Jsc), as well as improved solubility (resulting in improved morphology).
A series of DBF copolymers containing benzene (32), naphthalene (33), and anthracene (34) were synthesized by Sonar et al. in order to study the effects of the spacer ring size on the optoelectronic properties of these polymers.79 Thin film XRD patterns of 32, 33, and 34 showed sharp primary (100) peaks at 2θ = 4.96, 5.02, and 4.48°, and broad peaks centred at 2θ = 20.74, 21.18, and 20.08°, respectively. The primary peaks represent the respective interlayer distance to be 1.779 nm, 1.758 nm, and 1.970 nm, while the broad peaks were considered to reflect the π–π distance and the amorphous phase. In OTFT devices, hole mobilities of 0.04, 0.11, and 0.07 cm2 V−1 s−1 were achieved for 32, 33, and 34, respectively. The higher mobility of 33 than those of the other two polymers might be due to its more coplanar backbone structure, which is supported by computer simulations. When these polymers were used as donors in OPVs, PCEs of 2.6% (Jsc = 8.6 mA cm−2; Voc = 0.71 V; FF = 0.42) and 2.5% (Jsc = 7.8 mA cm−2; Voc = 0.69 V; FF = 0.45) were achieved for 33 and 34, respectively, while the devices based on 32 showed a much lower PCE of 0.78% (Jsc = 3.6 mA cm−2; Voc = 0.56 V; FF = 0.37). The lower mobility of 32 might result in unbalanced carrier mobility and electron–hole recombination, leading to lower Voc and Jsc.
Polymer 35,80 which corresponds to DBT-based polymer 14a, was recently reported by Sonar et al.48 The optical band gap and energy levels of this polymer are all very close to those of 14a. The 2D XRD diffraction pattern of 35 exhibited a strong peak at 2θ = 4.51 Å, corresponding to an interlayer d-spacing of 1.996 nm. The π–π stacking distance for the 200 °C annealed film was determined to be 0.36 nm, also similar to that of 14a. However, 35 exhibited a significantly lower hole mobility of 0.13 cm2 V−1 s−1compared to 14a. The unexpected poor charge transport performance of 35 might be due to its much lower molecular weight.
Polymer 36, based on DBF and benzothiadiazole,81 displayed a blue-shift in λmax (878 nm in thin film) compared to the DBT-benzothiadiazole polymer 25a (λmax = 915 nm in thin film).71 The 2D XRD diagram showed a primary diffraction peak at 2θ = 5.27°, corresponding to a d-spacing of 0.1678 nm. The existence of a broad peak in the region from 18° to 28° (2θ) suggested that this polymer is not very crystalline. OTFT devices based on 36 exhibited balanced hole and electron mobilities of 0.18 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.16 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, at an annealing temperature of 120 °C. When the annealing temperature was increased to 200 °C, the hole/electron mobilities improved to 0.61/0.67 cm2 V−1 s−1, which are better than the values achieved for DBT based polymer 25a.
Recently Shahid et al. reported two DBS based polymers 37 and 38 with the comonomer units of selenophene and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene, respectively.82 The lower LUMO level of selenophene in DBS compared to thiophene in DBT was expected to enhance the mixing of its LUMO with that of the DPP unit, resulting in a lowered LUMO level of the polymer. The optical band gaps of 1.18 eV and 1.20 eV were determined for polymers 37 and 38, which are smaller than those of their respective thiophene analogues 15a (1.30 eV) and 8 (1.23 eV). The LUMO level of 37 is much lower than that of 8, but those of 38 and 15a are similar. Polymer 37 exhibited ambipolar characteristics with balanced hole (0.11 cm2 V−1 s−1) and electron (0.11 cm2 V−1 s−1) mobilities. On the other hand, 38 exhibited a much higher hole mobility of 1.1 cm2 V−1 s−1, and a slightly higher electron mobility of 0.15 cm2 V−1 s−1.
Shahid et al. also reported a DBS and dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene based polymer 39,58 an analogue of polymer 17. The HOMO and LUMO levels of 39 are −5.09 and −3.59 eV, respectively. Compared with 17, these results implied that the replacement of thiophene with selenophene caused a reduction in band gap (1.64 eV for 17vs. 1.50 eV for 39) and a slight decrease in the LUMO level (−3.53 eV for 17vs. −3.59 eV for 39). An XRD study of the 39 thin films indicated that a slight distortion occurred to the polymer backbone due to the incorporation of selenophene, which has longer C–Se bonds. OTFTs based on 39 showed ambipolar performance with the highest hole/electron mobilities of 0.13/0.010 cm2 V−1 s−1, lower than the mobilities (0.23/0.015 cm2 V−1 s−1) of 17 reported by the same group. The OPV devices based on 39:PC71BM (1:2) gave a PCE of 4.05%. The lower PCE than that of 17 (5.1%) is mainly caused by the reduction in Voc arising from its higher HOMO level.
DBS-based polymer 40 was synthesized to compare with its counterpart, DBT-based 25a.83 The presence of selenophene in 40 led to a much smaller band gap (1.05 eV) than that of 25a (1.20 eV). The HOMO level of −5.16 eV obtained for 40 is higher than that of 25a. The 2D GIXRD analysis of 40 indicated that the films were semicrystalline. By increasing the annealing temperature from 100 °C to 200 °C, the π–π stacking distance of 40 reduced from 0.370 nm to 0.364 nm. OTFTs with 100 °C annealed 40 showed ambipolar transport characteristics with average hole/electron mobilities of 0.48/0.62 cm2 V−1 s−1. Annealing at 200 °C further enhanced the electron mobility to 0.84 cm2 V−1 s−1, while the hole mobility remained the same. Increasing the molecular weight Mn from 30k to 130k, the electron mobility improved further to 0.97 cm2 V−1 s−1, while the hole mobility dropped to 0.2 cm2 V−1 s−1. The enhanced electron transport compared to its DBT analogue 25a was explained by the lower LUMO level of 40 (−3.84 eV for 40vs. −3.77 eV for 25a). These results suggest that the larger and more polarisable selenium atom in selenophene might help improve the electron transport.
Bronstein et al. developed a new building block, DBTT, by replacing thiophenes in DBT with the larger thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) units.84 The TT units would promote a more delocalized HOMO distribution along the backbone, which was expected to enhance intermolecular charge transport. Due to the strong interchain interactions, the two DBTT-based polymers reported, 41 and 42, showed poor solubility and only low molecular weight polymers were obtained (Mn = 14 kDa for 41 and 16 kDa for 42). These two polymers have the same HOMO levels of −5.05 eV, whereas their LUMO levels are slightly different at −3.68 eV (41) and −3.76 eV (42). Both polymers showed ambipolar transport behaviour in OTFT devices. 41 gave average hole/electron mobilities of 1.42/0.063 cm2 V−1 s−1. The best device showed hole/electron mobilities of 1.95/0.03 cm2 V−1 s−1. On the other hand, 42 showed a lower hole mobility of 0.037 cm2 V−1 s−1, but a higher electron mobility of 0.30 cm2 V−1 s−1. The lower LUMO level of 42 might facilitate its electron transport. OPV devices based on 41:PC71BM at a ratio of 1:2 achieved a PCE of 5.4% (Jsc = 15.0 mA cm−2; Voc = 0.58 V; FF = 0.61), while the 42:PC71BM based devices showed a lower PCE of 3.0% (Jsc = 8.9 mA cm−2; Voc = 0.57 V; FF = 0.59). The difference in PCE between 41 and 42 is mainly a result of their different Jsc. This was explained by the authors to be a result of the larger distance between the DPP moieties in 41, which would allow for intercalation of the acceptor molecules. This might also be due to the smaller offset energy between the LUMO levels of 42 and PC71BM, which leads to less efficient charge separation, as observed for 15a. The much lower EQE of the 42-based devices might support this hypothesis.
4 DPP-containing small molecular semiconductors (Scheme 7)
Solution processable π-conjugated small molecules are alternatives to polymeric semiconductors for printed organic electronics. Their advantages over polymers include monodispersity, ease of synthesis and purification, and less variation between batches.85–87 Unlike polymers, however, the lack of interconnectivity of small molecules is believed to cause poor charge transport in many cases.
 Scheme 7  DPP-containing small molecule semiconductors for OTFTs. 
Suraru et al. reported a small molecule DBT compound 43 that is substituted with two electron withdrawing CN groups.88 The HOMO and LUMO levels of 43 obtained by the CV measurements were −5.66 eV and −3.56 eV, respectively. The vacuum deposited thin films of 43 at different substrate temperatures were investigated as the channel semiconductor in bottom-gate–top-contact OTFT devices. The highest hole mobility of 0.7 cm2 V−1 s−1 was achieved for the device with a 43 thin film deposited at a substrate temperature of 70 °C. Uniform thin films comprising large crystalline grains (as large as ∼0.5 μm × 1 μm) were observed under an AFM. The large grain size would minimize the number of grain boundaries, which is favourable for charge transport.
Two DBT based quinoidal small molecular compounds 44a and 44b, which have four strong electron withdrawing CN groups, were reported recently by Qiao et al.89 The optical band gaps calculated for 44a and 44b from their absorption onsets are 1.73 and 1.72 eV, respectively. The LUMO levels of these two compounds obtained from the CV data are the same at −4.51 eV. The very low lying LUMO levels are favourable for the injection and transport of electrons in OTFTs. Single crystal XRD analysis of 44a showed that this compound is highly planar due to the π-conjugated quinoidal backbone and that the molecules are packed in a columnar π-stacking structure with a short π–π distance of only 0.340 nm. Additionally, side-by-side intramolecular hydrogen bonds were observed. Both compounds showed n-type semiconductor performance in OTFTs (Fig. 21). The highest electron mobilities achieved were 0.55 and 0.35 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 44a and 44b, respectively, both thermally evaporated at a substrate temperature of 120 °C. The devices based on 44a exhibited good air stability over a period of two weeks. 44b based devices were also fabricated using spin coating. The optimized devices showed electron mobilities of up to 0.35 cm2 V−1 s−1, suggesting that 44b is a promising n-type semiconductor for solution processed OTFTs.

Another DBT quinoidal compound 44c, which has straight hexadecyl side chains, was later reported by Zhong et al.9044c was mixed with poly(α-methyl styrene) at a 1:1 weight ratio in tetrahydronaphthalene, for fabricating OTFT devices by spin coating the hot blend solution on a hot substrate at 125–160 °C. Devices showed high electron mobilities of ∼0.5 cm2 V−1 s−1, both in the linear and saturation regimes under nitrogen. The transistor characteristics remained almost unchanged after exposure to ambient air for 1300 min, indicating the good ambient stability of this material.
5 Conclusions
Since the first DPP-based polymer semiconductor for OTFTs was reported in 2008,35 over 30 DPP-based polymers have been reported to show a charge carrier mobility greater than 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1, more than any other type of polymer semiconductors.10 With a suitable combination of the electron-accepting DPP unit and other electron donating building blocks, polymer semiconductors with mobility values of around 1 cm2 V−1 s−1 or greater can be obtained. As the length of the electron donating segment increases, the DPP polymers can transform from ambipolar (or n-type) to unipolar p-type semiconductors. On the other hand, incorporation of an additional electron acceptor unit can enhance the electron transport. The highly efficient charge transport observed for the DPP based D–A polymers can be interpreted by the strong intermolecular interactions enhanced by the D–A interaction between the DPP units in one polymer chain and the electron donating units in another. The strong intermolecular interactions result in a shorter π–π stacking distance that is favourable for interchain charge hopping. The substituents are not only crucial for solubilising the DPP polymers but also have profound effects on the coplanarity of the polymer backbone, the molecular organization, and the thin film morphology. It seems that long branched side chains are required to substitute the DPP units to provide sufficient solubility, while unnecessarily bulky or excessive substituents would cause twisting of the polymer backbone, which is detrimental to molecular ordering and charge transport. In addition, the crystallinity, chain orientation in crystalline domains, thin film morphology, etc. are all influenced strongly by the type and regiochemical arrangement of the side chains. For many DPP polymers, a lamellar crystal structure with an edge-on orientation can be established during solution processing with or without thermal annealing, which assures highly efficient charge transport in an OTFT device. Interestingly, in some rare cases, high mobility values were also achieved for DPP polymers having a face-on orientation and even in an amorphous state. Further understanding of the relationship between the chain packing and charge transport for the DPP polymers is needed.
All DPP-based polymers have rather low band gaps originating from the intramolecular D–A charge transfer. By using appropriate electron donating groups, the HOMO/LUMO energy levels, as well as the optical band gap of the DPP polymers, could be finely tuned for optimum light harvesting in OPV applications. Several high mobility DPP polymers showed excellent photovoltaic performance with PCE exceeding 6%. The correlation between the mobility of the DPP polymer donor and the power conversion efficiency of the OPVs, however, remains unclear since the number of high mobility DPP polymers that have been investigated in OPV devices is still limited. Interestingly, a recent study found that using the high hole mobility polymer 5 allows the fabrication of OPVs with a wide range of active layer thickness (~100 nm to ~800 nm) without undermining the photovoltaic performance, which is favored for the manufacture of large area OPV devices through a high throughput printing process.91
In comparison to the DPP polymers, small molecule DPP compounds have been studied to a far lesser extent. Nonetheless, certain small molecule DPP semiconductors showed very promising performance in OTFT devices. Compounds 44a–c, in particular, are excellent air-stable n-type semiconductors. 44c, which could be solution processed by blending with a polymer binder, is a very promising n-type semiconductor for printed CMOS-like circuits.
In summary, DPP-based small molecules and polymers have been demonstrated to be an important class of organic semiconductor materials for OTFTs and OPVs. The charge carrier mobility of many DPP molecules has reached or exceeded the mobility of amorphous silicon. The current best mobility achieved by the DPP polymers is ∼10.5 cm2 V−1 s−1,51 which is approaching the mobility range of polycrystalline silicon and some other inorganic semiconductors. The OTFT devices, and their integrated circuits using these high mobility DPP materials, would be sufficient for many applications in which amorphous or even polycrystalline silicon TFTs are currently being used, such as the backplane drivers for the liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and OLED displays. In view of their excellent mechanical properties and ease of fabrication by using conventional solution processing technologies, OTFTs based on DPP polymers will be particularly suitable for flexible electronics. On the other hand, high mobility DPP polymers have also shown promising performance in OPV devices, with the highest PCE of 6.05%.57 Further improvements in efficiency are possible for OPVs using DPP polymers if additional efforts are directed toward refining the structure, energy levels, and processing conditions of the DPP polymers and their blends with acceptor materials.

Broader context
Organic electronics, which include organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs), are expected to partly replace traditional silicon-based electronics and generate new applications in the near future. The biggest driving force behind the research into organic electronics is the notion that their manufacturing consumes much less energy and emits little or no harmful substances to the environment. Charge transport of organic semiconductors, the key components of organic electronics, is one of the most fundamental and critical parameters that determine the device performance. For years, low charge carrier mobility has been the hurdle that impedes commercialization of OTFTs. On the other hand, insufficient charge mobilities of donor and acceptor materials in OPVs can lead to charge recombination, resulting in poor power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells. Recently, a large number of new organic semiconductors containing the diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) building block, which show mobility similar to or higher than that of amorphous silicon, have been developed. In this paper, we discuss the structural design, optoelectronic properties, molecular organization, morphology, as well as performances of these promising materials for OTFTs and OPVs.


 	Fig. 1  The general structure of a DPP-based D–A molecule and its applications as a channel semiconductor in a bottom-gate–top-contact OTFT device (where S, D, and G are source, drain, and gate electrodes, respectively) and as a donor and light absorber in an OPV device.	 

 	Scheme 1  A typical synthetic route for DPP compounds and several DPP-containing building blocks for DPP-based conjugated polymers (R is a suitable substituent, which is mostly an alkyl).
