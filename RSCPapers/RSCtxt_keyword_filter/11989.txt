    , Accepted 15th February 2015First published on 16th February 2015AbstractThe synthesis and characterization of a series of dumbbell-shaped molecules constructed from paraffin-free central dyes linked to two triazatruxene (TAT) units are described. The photovoltaic properties of these new glassy electron-donating molecules in a bulk heterojunction with fullerene derivatives have been studied. For this series of molecules, the local-range molecular packing in the amorphous solid state is mainly influenced by the TAT units bearing bulky side-chains, while the optical properties and energy levels are tuned by the choice of the central core. Therefore, TAT acts as a structuration platform in thin films for pure or blended active layers and independently, the optoelectronic properties are driven by the choice of the central dye. Photovoltaic cells based on these materials exhibited power conversion efficiencies of up to 3.5%, among the top values reported so far for soluble amorphous small molecule based organic photovoltaic devices. These TAT-based derivatives are a promising platform to reach high solar cell efficiencies as well as to understand in detail the impact of the chemical structure on the optoelectronic properties.
Introduction
The field of soluble semiconducting small molecules for organic photovoltaic (OPV) applications has blossomed over the last decade. An intensive effort in the design and synthesis of advanced molecules together with the device optimization has allowed the power conversion efficiency of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells processed from soluble molecules to rapidly expand from 4.4% (ref. 1) in 2009 to more than 9% nowadays.2
Optimization of their performances requires a convergent effort from chemists and physicists, as it usually requires a compromise between optoelectronic and physico-chemical properties. Small molecules used as an electron donor in a BHJ solar cell should meet several prerequisites, in particular (i) a broad absorption spectrum in the visible wavelength range along with a high extinction coefficient, (ii) suitable frontier energy levels (HOMO and LUMO levels) to promote exciton dissociation and a high open circuit voltage, (iii) a sufficient solubility for wet processing and (iv) an appropriate solid state structuration to sustain charge transport and collection.3
The fine-tuning of the optoelectronic properties of electron-donor polymers or small molecules has been performed frequently by using the alternating donor–acceptor (D–A) approach.4 The strength of the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) resulting from this D–A alternation can be easily modulated by the nature of electron-rich and electron-deficient units constituting the D and A building blocks. However, it has been shown recently that an accurate prediction of the structure–optoelectronic property relationship is difficult, as a small change in chemical structure might influence these properties strongly.5 For instance, alkyl side chains, which are necessary to promote solubility in organic solvents, have been found to impact the electronic properties as well. Indeed, their nature or grafting position affected markedly both, the intra-chain delocalization and the inter-molecular packing by steric hindrance, influencing in turn the charge carrier transport properties.6 Alkyl side chains could also act on the electron-donor/electron-acceptor miscibility and therefore impact on the optimum electron-donor/-acceptor ratio.7
Recently, we introduced the triazatruxene (TAT) unit as a chemical moiety for OPV applications that combine both a planar shape, influencing favorably the active layer morphology, and a good solubility due to the three nitrogen-carried alkyl side chains.8 The good performances showed that the TAT core can be used as an effective electron-donating building block for molecular materials in BHJ solar cells. We aimed at developing a soluble TAT core as an electron-rich platform that allows the combination with a wide choice of side-chain-free electron-deficient units. The TAT core is expected to provide by its own enough solubility for the solution processing and to act as a structuring agent in the solid state. Note that the TAT fragment has also been used by other groups as building blocks for efficient star-shaped electroluminescent9 and OPV10 materials. In this paper, we report on the synthesis, material characterization and photovoltaic properties of a new series of dumbbell-shaped solution-processable conjugated molecules using TAT as the end-capper and various “naked” central electro-deficient units A (Scheme 1). This approach is expected to bring high chemical design flexibility as it allows us to handle almost separately the morphological (driven by the TAT) and optoelectronic issues. We anticipate, by changing the naked central group, to tune quasi-independently the optoelectronic properties of the electron donor molecule without changing significantly its morphological behavior in the BHJ solar cell active layer. Herein, we used three classical electron-deficient units A with increasing electron affinity: benzo[2,1,3]thiadiazole (Btz) < pyridal[2,1,3]thiadiazole (Pytz) < thieno[1,2,5]thiadiazole (Ttz).4 These units were sandwiched between two TATs including one thiophene unit to form the central core of the dumbbell-shaped molecule, as shown in Scheme 1. All new molecules were blended with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) to form BHJ solar cells, and gave rise to efficient power conversion efficiencies, with a maximum value of 3.5%.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The general synthetic protocol for the preparation of TAT-based compounds is sketched in Scheme 2.
TAT being a carbazole analogue, two isomers of the boronate derivative, the 2-boronate-5,10,15-triazatruxene (1, meta-isomer) and the 3-bromo-5,10,15-triazatruxene (2, para-isomer), are accessible. In a previous study, we observed almost no difference in the optoelectronic properties between the meta- and para-isomers when substituted with a diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) core.8a
However, a slight improvement in the final power conversion efficiency (PCE) measured with the meta-isomer was established. Because of the invariance of properties measured by UV-visible and cyclic-voltammetry and confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we suggest that this increase in the PCE was most probably due to a slight morphological difference at the nanometer scale. In order to help clarifying this result, we decided to synthesize the two TAT-isomers in the case of the benzothiadiazole-based dye.
Hence, the two boronated-TAT isomers were synthesized following a previously reported protocol.8a The synthesis of the three central chromophores was undertaken according to the procedure described in the ESI section.†
The dumbbell-shaped molecules were obtained using a final Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction between the boronated-TAT derivative and the dibrominated central dye, in the presence of Pd2dba3 catalyst, P(o-tolyl)3 ligand and K2CO3 in a refluxing toluene/1,4-dioxane solvent mixture for 48 hours (Scheme 2). All compounds were isolated in good purity and with moderate yields (ranging from 19 to 45%), after purification steps including column chromatography and precipitation. Novel compounds were characterized by NMR and MALDI-TOF (see ESI†), and unambiguously correspond to the drawn structures.

Material properties
The TAT-derivatives 6m and 6p–8p have been intensively investigated by a number of techniques in order to characterize their thermal and optical properties, as well as to determine their energy levels and hole mobility values. The results are gathered in Table 1.

UV-vis absorption spectra of the molecules in chloroform solutions and in thin films are given in Fig. 1, and the peak maximum of the low energy transitions is reported in Table 1.
All absorption spectra of the TAT compounds in the solution and in thin-film exhibit three maxima. Two of which are located below 500 nm and the third one appears between 500 and 900 nm. The latter is dependent on the electron affinity of the central acceptor unit and is therefore likely to originate from an internal charge transfer (ICT).11 This ICT band is more red-shifted when the strength of the electron acceptor increases from 6p to 7p and then to 8p. It is interesting to note that almost no difference could be observed between the spectrum of TAT-meta (6m) and TAT-para (6p) regioisomers having the benzothiadiazole (BTz) unit as an electron acceptor unit. This result is in agreement with previous observations on similar architectures using DPP as the central chromophore.8a All thin-film spectra are broadened and red-shifted compared to their solution counterparts (from 20 to 40 nm) indicating higher inter-molecular interactions within the solid state. One can note that the bathochromic shift between the solution and solid-state is smaller for compound 8p (Δλ = 20 nm) compared to the other compounds (Δλ = 40 nm).
 Fig. 1  UV-visible absorption spectra of the TAT-based molecules recorded in chloroform (a) and in thin film (b). 
The solid-state energy bandgaps (Eg opt) estimated from the low energy band edges of the thin-film absorption spectra range from 1.8 eV to 1.4 eV (see Table 1). As expected, the energy bandgap of compound 8p is the lowest and makes it a good candidate for near-infrared optoelectronic devices. Moreover, the energy bandgap of compound 8p is close to the optimal value predicted by Queisser et al. for homojunction solar cells.12 As anticipated, changing the central core electron withdrawing strength (from Btz to Pytz and to Ttz) broadens the absorption spectra distribution and therefore allows covering a wider range of the UV-visible spectrum.
Cyclic voltammetry characterizations of all compounds have been performed in solution (dichloromethane) with a platinum electrode to determine the HOMO and LUMO levels of the molecules. PC71BM and ferrocene were used as internal references, enabling the determination of the frontier molecular orbital energies. Each central dye (3, 4 and 5) with its respective electron acceptor unit (Btz, Pytz and Ttz) has been also characterized individually (see Fig. S4 in the ESI†). The cyclic voltammograms corresponding to the novel compounds (6m and 6p–8p) are reported in Fig. 2. The HOMO and LUMO levels and the electrochemical gap calculated from the electrochemical data are given in Table 1. The TAT fragment is not electroactive in reduction in the potential ranges explored (down to −2.1 V). For all compounds, only the central sub-units exhibit reduction potentials with two reduction waves. In contrast, the positive potential region of the voltammograms presents more features since both, the central unit and the TAT fragments, show oxidation waves. Indeed, the TAT fragment presents three reversible mono-electronic oxidations in the range of 0.4 to 1.4 V, while all central units present two mono-electronic reversible and/or quasi-reversible oxidation waves in a similar range of 0.3 to 1.4 V.
 Fig. 2  Cyclic voltammograms of the TAT-based molecules in dichloromethane solution using TBAPF6 as the supporting electrolyte. 
In practice for compounds 6m and 6p–7p, the HOMO energy levels are mainly governed by the first oxidation potential of the TAT fragment. This leads to a similar HOMO level for all these TAT-compounds in the order of −5.25 eV.
Compound 8p presents a particular behavior as the higher HOMO level value of −5.11 eV is due to the oxidation of the Ttz-based central unit. Unlike HOMO levels, the LUMO levels are strongly dependent on the nature of the central withdrawing unit. Thus, as the electron withdrawing strength increases, the LUMO values decreases from −3.60 to −3.84 and to −3.92 eV for compounds 6p, 7p and 8p, respectively. Altogether, the electrochemical bandgap of the TAT compounds is found to increase from 8p (1.2 eV), 7p (1.42 eV) to 6p–6m (1.64 eV), in agreement with UV-vis absorption measurements (see Fig. 3).

Finally, it is interesting to note similar electrochemical data obtained for 6p and 6m, showing the invariance of redox properties on the functionalization position (meta or para) to the TAT fragment. This observation is in agreement again with previous studies on similar compounds.8a
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been performed on different compounds at the B3LYP/6-311+G* level of theory in a vacuum using the Spartan 10 software.13 To maintain the calculation time reasonable, the alkyl chains were replaced by methyl groups. The resulting HOMO and LUMO level positions along the conjugated backbone for compound 7p are exemplified in Fig. 4. The HOMO frontier orbitals for all molecules extend slightly onto the TAT units, while the LUMO frontier orbitals remain essentially on the central part of the molecule, similarly to what has been observed also previously.8a All molecules presented similar energy level features (see Fig. S5–S7 in the ESI†).
 Fig. 4  Calculated LUMO (above) and HOMO (below) levels for compound 7p. 
Despite the usual offset between the calculated and measured HOMO and LUMO levels (0.6 ± 0.1 eV for the HOMO level and 1.10 ± 0.04 eV for the LUMO level), the trend observed for the measured and calculated levels of compounds 6m and 6p–8p is the same (compare values in Tables 1 and 2). In order to understand how the central unit affects the HOMO and LUMO levels, calculations using the same formalism were performed on intermediate compounds 1–5.

The energy offset between the TAT LUMO and all the central cores' LUMO is too high (more than 2.1 eV) to promote hybridization between LUMOs of different constituents. Therefore, the LUMO of the dumbbell-shaped molecules (6m and 6–8p) is driven by the chemical fragment with the deepest LUMO, i.e. by the central unit. The situation is different for the HOMO levels as the offset between the TAT HOMO and the central dye HOMO ranges from 0.11 eV (1 and 5) to 0.69 eV (1 and 4). Hybridization between HOMOs of different constituents can therefore be very efficient, especially between dyes 1 (or 2) and 5. The consequence is a high lying HOMO level in the dumbbell-shaped molecules with thieno[1,2,5]thiadiazole (Ttz) as a central unit (8p). This is consistent with a previous experimental observation highlighting the role of the lowering oxidation potential effect when using the Ttz moiety.14
These data draw an interesting scenario, in which it appears that the optical properties and energy levels are mainly governed by the nature of the central core. Moreover, the HOMO level of compounds 6m, 6p and 7p is theoretically well positioned to reach a high open circuit voltage (Voc) in organic solar cells since the offset between the LUMO level of PC71BM and the HOMO level of aforementioned compounds is above 1 V.15
Thermal properties have been characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, see Fig. S1 in the ESI section†). The only thermal event observed in the thermograms is a glass transition, thus revealing that all molecules are amorphous. The three TAT para-isomers 6p–8p exhibit the same glass transition temperature around Tg = 85 °C, while the meta-isomer 6m exhibit a slightly lower value at Tg = 69 °C (see Table 1).
The amorphous character of the TAT-based molecules has been confirmed by (powder) small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments at room temperature. As seen in Fig. 5, all molecules exhibit quite similar patterns.
 Fig. 5  Powder SAXS patterns recorded for the TAT-based molecules 6m and 6p–8p at room temperature after annealing at 100 °C for 2 hours. 
Obviously, the four SAXS patterns show the same local-range correlated organization, as they contain no sharp reflections, but several broad scattering signals with nearly identical locations and widths. In particular a unique maximum at ca. 4.4 Å (2θ ≈ 20°) is observed in the wide-region that characterizes the lateral packing of neighboring segments. This signal mainly comes from lateral distances between alkyl chains and the notable absence of a second maximum at 3.8 Å confirms the absence of π-stacked assemblies. Such molecular assemblies are indeed hindered by the sterically demanding aliphatic chains (especially large for ramified chains), whose overall cross-section would far exceed the available area for face-to-face stacked TAT units.16
The small-angle scattering maxima (at ca. 11–12 and 20–22 Å) nevertheless prove the persistence of the rigid core/soft chain segregation, the high area requirement of the aliphatic periphery being then fulfilled by shifts and tilts apart of the rigid moieties. This disordered arrangement of conjugated segments then results in irregular interfaces with aliphatic domains, which explains the broad shape of scattering signals and the macroscopic amorphous state. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the two bands systematically observed in the SAXS patterns at ca. 11–12 and 20–22 Å (correlation length of 2 to 3 molecules) should correspond to irregular piling up of chain-substituted elemental TAT fragments and TAT dumbbell-shaped molecules, respectively. A deeper understanding of the segregated structure would require additional information, such as systematic variations in the aliphatic periphery, going however beyond the scope of this contribution that deals with the variation of the electro-deficient unit in a TAT dumbbell-shaped molecule for OPV applications. The important result to keep in mind here is that the aliphatic chains nano-segregate in the periphery of domains formed by semiconducting segments. Even though these segments are not π-stacked, the local order is sufficient to preserve semiconducting pathways and preserve decent charge transport properties in pure materials (see below).
Charge transport properties have been determined in organic field effect transistors (OFET) devices with a bottom contact–bottom gate configuration. Hole-mobility values (Table 1) were estimated from the transfer characteristics in the linear as well as the saturation regime. Details on the OFET devices fabrication can be found in the ESI.† For all TAT-based molecules, mobility values ranging from 10−5 to 8 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 have been obtained on as-cast devices, confirming the weak impact of the central chromophore on the morphological issues. In addition, both meta- and para-isomers (6m, 6p) show the same mobility values confirming the negligible effect of the TAT connecting position on the material optoelectronic properties, as evidenced above from the optical and electrochemical characterization results.
Photovoltaic properties
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices were prepared in an inverted device configuration using the recently developed 80% ethoxylated polyethyleneimine (PEIE) interface layer.17 The thin layer of this polymer having pendant alkylamine groups is known to reduce the work function of ITO and can be processed in air from non-toxic alcoholic solutions. It is a highly interesting alternative to standard low-work function metal-oxide films. A reflective MoO3/Ag electrode has been used to collect holes on the top surface of the device. The active layers made up of TAT-based molecular compounds:PC71BM blends have been deposited by spin-coating from chlorobenzene solutions, with and without 1,8-diiodoctane (DIO) as the additive. A thermal annealing step of the active layer has been performed before MoO3/Ag evaporation. The optimal thermal annealing temperatures and times result from experimental adjustments. Although our molecules are amorphous, annealing above the glass transition temperature softens the thin film and somehow improves the device performances. Each OPV device had an active area of 12 mm2. Details on the OPV device fabrication can be found in the ESI.† Electrical parameters of OPV devices are summarized in Table 3. The (J–V) curves for the best devices with 0.6% DIO are reported in Fig. 6.

For each TAT-based compounds (6m and 6–8p), the optimum molecule:PC71BM ratio was found around 1:5, indicating that a high PC71BM loading is required to extract electrons efficiently. Such a low donor molecule:PCBM ratio might probably point out an intercalation of the fullerene derivative into the molecular structure, as already reported in a number of polymer:fullerene systems.18 In these reference materials, intercalation occurred only with conjugated segments devoid of alkyl chains, which is actually the case with the naked central core between the two TAT units in our materials. In these chain-free zones, a fraction of PCBM could come in contact with the aromatic core of the dumbbell-shaped molecules to modify the material's morphology and finally the device performances. Moreover, the incorporation of PCBM would favorably compensate the overcrowded chains in the TAT fragments in order to obtain better-defined aromatic and aliphatic domains with a sharper interface. This assumption is supported by previous results obtained on TAT-based similar molecules (see ref. 8a and Fig. 7), in which the use of the central DPP core sterically hindered by two ramified alkyl chains led to a more balanced optimum molecule:PCBM ratio of about 1:0.75.
 Fig. 7  TAT–DPP molecule studied in ref. 8a. 
The influence of the nature and grafting position of alkyl side-chains on the morphology of TAT-based dumbbell-shaped molecules as pure materials or in PCBM blends deserves an extensive study that will be published in a forthcoming paper.
Although presenting similar XRD patterns and optoelectronic properties, the two benzothiadiazole-based isomers 6m and 6p show significant differences in OPV performances. The origin of the difference is still unclear, but as already noticed in a former study (ref. 8a), we found again a higher PCE for the TAT para-isomer (2.9% for 6p against 2.1% for the meta-isomer 6m) under similar optimized conditions. In agreement with energy levels measured by cyclic voltammetry, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) shows high and constant values around 0.8 V for compounds 6m, 6p and 7p. The fill-factors are also similar to values ranging from 40 to 45%. The highest PCE value of 3.5% has been achieved with dye 7p in blend with PC71BM using 0.6% v/v of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as the high boiling point processing additive.19 As shown by AFM, adding DIO improves the film morphology by reducing the number of aggregates (see Fig. S8 and S9 in the ESI†). This leads to a better mixing between the donor and acceptor phases and is likely to be at the origin of the increase in photocurrent. The increase of PCE between 6p (2.9%) and 7p (3.5%) (relative increase of 20%) is mainly attributed to the increase of short-circuit current density (Jsc) from 8.1 to 9.4 mA cm−2 (relative increase of 16%). This Jsc increase could be attributed to the lower energy bandgap of compound 7p implying a red shift in the absorption spectrum, all other parameters (molecule:fullerene ratio and hole mobility) being almost identical.
Unlike other donor molecules, compound 8p behaves differently and finally exhibits rather poor OPV performances.
As expected from its lower HOMO level, its Voc is significantly lower than the one obtained for other molecules. The measured Jsc value for 8p was also found to be rather low despite its low bandgap. Moreover, a low FF of 29% suggests a poor charge extraction that could be indicative of a significant charge recombination. It has to be noted that for this compound 8p in combination with PC71BM as the electron acceptor, the LUMO offset calculated from cyclic voltammetry is close to 0.3 eV, that is considered to be the lowest acceptable offset value for efficient exciton dissociation.20 This low LUMO offset could be an explanation for a significant charge recombination in compound 8p. On the other hand, a lower hole mobility for dye 8p can also explain the low Jsc and FF values measured on OPV devices using this compound.
Finally, a combination of the electron donors 6p and 7p has been used in blend with PC71BM in order to broaden the absorption spectra of the donor compounds. Indeed, ternary blend-based devices are quite promising systems under the conditions of a good compatibility of molecules. From the similarity of chemical structures and of the amorphous nature, these two molecules 6p and 7p appear to be good candidates for elaborating the ternary blend with enough compatibility. A ratio of 1:1 between both molecules has been used while the global donor:acceptor ratio has been kept constant to the optimized 1:5 ratio. Thereof devices lead to a rather good PCE of 3.1% with a Voc of almost 0.8 V. Interestingly, the Jsc increases significantly as expected from the addition of two absorption spectra complementing each other. This is also highlighted by the External Quantum Efficiency (EQE) measurements displayed in Fig. 8. Indeed, as expected from the superposition of UV-visible spectra in thin films (Fig. 1b), the EQE of the OPV device with the mixture 6p + 7p is slightly higher than the one with 7p. Unfortunately, the FF is slightly decreasing in regard to the best 7p cell, leading to a PCE that does not exceed the one for 7p.

Altogether, the results of the mixture show that both molecules are well miscible and open up the possibility to optimize device performances by mixing complementary amorphous TAT-based dumbbell-shaped molecules.
Overall observations and results tend to confirm the envisioned scenario, i.e. OPV properties of these TAT-based dumbbell-shaped molecules are essentially governed by the nature of the central side-chain-free dye segment. Direct relationships could be established between the OPV and optoelectronic properties of compounds 6p–8p without any significant input of the morphology aspects, as all systems exhibit the same structural behavior and show the optimal performances for similar high molecule:PC71BM ratios in the range of 1:5.
Conclusions
We have designed and synthesized a series of amorphous dumbbell-shaped molecules made of central dyes of different nature in between two triazatruxene (TAT) platforms, to be used as electron donor small molecules for photovoltaic applications. Alkyl chains (2-ethylhexyl) have been inserted, only on the TAT fragments giving amorphous states, to ensure good solubility and processability of the molecules. These sterically demanding branched alkyl chains were found to hinder the face-to-face stacking of the TAT fragments. Nevertheless, segregation of conjugated segments and aliphatic chains takes place, ultimately leading to local segregation of TAT-rich and dye-rich domains. Whatever be the chemical modifications of the central units, all compounds exhibit the same structural features with the formation of an amorphous character, as evidenced by SAXS and DSC analyses. In particular, the absence of molecular π-stacking was not detrimental for charge transport as the hole mobility could be clearly extracted from OFET measurements on the pure compounds.
The very similar thermal, structural and charge-transport properties observed for all TAT-based dumbbell-shaped molecules therefore confirm that these properties are essentially driven by the general molecular architecture, without a significant influence of the nature of the central dye and the inherent optoelectronic properties.
Regarding photovoltaic property studies, the devices fabricated from blends between the dumbbell-shaped donor molecules and the electron acceptor PC71BM showed optimal performances when the PC71BM ratios were of about 5 to 1. These high PC71BM contents presumably result from the general donor molecule architecture, for which a tentative explanation was proposed.
In the series, the best performances were obtained for the molecule with the pyridal[2,1,3]thiadiazole central electro-deficient unit (maximum PCE of 3.5%). The improvement with respect to the molecules containing the benzo[2,1,3]thiadiazole core is mainly due to a higher Jsc value, in relation to a lower energy bandgap.
Amorphous nature engineered by molecular design was found to promote a good compatibility between molecules, allowing elaborating a ternary blend with broader UV-visible absorption.
On the whole, it is demonstrated that by using a well-designed electron donor molecule, the morphological issues can be identified and distinguished separately from optoelectronic aspects. This is of particular importance to understand in depth the impact of the chemical structure on the optoelectronic properties as, for most of the systems, a slight change of the molecular structure strongly affects both the morphology and optoelectronic properties.
