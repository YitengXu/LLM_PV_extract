Here we studied the critical parameters that can affect the formation of vertically stratified bulk heterojunction organic solar cells based on various polymers with different side chains, and investigated the effect of the miscibility of the polymer–fullerene blend and the crystallinity of the polymer on vertical morphology. The major factor that affected the vertical phase separation was the interaction parameter χ between the polymer and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). Polymer–PCBM blends with high values of χ tended to trigger surface-directed vertical phase separation during rapid solvent evaporation. However, strong aggregation of polymers with low solubility counteracted this surface-directed vertical stratification. Moreover, solvent additives strongly affected the vertical phase separation processes, and caused the composition of the active layer to fluctuate dramatically. We also found the photovoltaic characteristics, including charge recombination time, to be strongly affected by the vertical distribution of the composition. The modulation of the composition in the vertical direction should therefore be optimized to increase the efficiency of charge collection and hence achieve high-efficiency organic solar cells.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are one of the most promising energy-harvesting devices for cost-effective energy technologies based on roll-to-roll processing on flexible substrates.1 Currently available OSCs have achieved high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 10–12%.2–4 A better understanding of organic semiconductor material design, processing, and device fabrication has contributed to these performance advancements.5,6 In particular, the use of novel semiconducting donor polymers have recently boosted the PCE; these materials absorb a wide range of wavelengths of light and have shown high quantum efficiencies for charge transfer and charge collection.7–10
Controlling the morphology of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) in donor and acceptor blend films is critical for attaining high PCEs. The BHJ morphology should be optimized to provide sufficient interfaces for efficient charge separation, and bicontinuous percolating networks for the transport of the charge carriers.6 The miscibility of the donor and acceptor materials, the size and composition of the phase-separated domains, their crystalline character, the presence of percolating charge transport networks, and the vertical concentration gradient are all important factors that must be considered when optimizing the photoactive layer of photovoltaic blends.11–14 Because the BHJ morphology is kinetically frozen during the rapid solvent evaporation of solution processing, the final morphology developed from the blend solution is not easily predicted.15 The molecular structure and properties of the donor and acceptor materials have an especially significant effect on the blend morphology. For example, the crystallinity of a donor material can affect the miscibility of fullerenes into the donor material, and strongly affects the degree of phase separation.16–19 Moreover, the difference between the surface energy of the polymer material and that of acceptor material affects both the intimacy of mixing and the vertical composition gradient.20–22
One of the challenging issues in BHJ OSCs is their high tendency to undergo charge recombination due to the random mixing of their donor and acceptor materials. In particular, charge recombination originates from the mismatch between the photocurrent distribution and the width of the charge transport channel in the vertical direction.13,23–25 When photogenerated charges cannot be efficiently extracted from the active layer due to low carrier mobility or undesirable surface wetting at the interface between the organic layer and metal electrode, photogenerated charges can accumulate; this phenomenon leads to bimolecular recombination.23,26–30 The use of BHJ films with compositional gradient in the vertical direction, specifically donor-enriched at the anode and acceptor-enriched at cathode have been proposed as an effective approach to facilitate charge extraction and to reduce charge recombination in photoactive layer.23,31,32 To establish charge selectivity at the electrode, the composition of the blend film at the air-exposed surface and the buried interface must be controlled.33 Although various studies have focused on the processing method, and on the analysis of vertical composition profiles,31,32,34,35 the mechanism underlying the evolution of morphology and the design of materials for vertical phase separation (VPS) in donor and acceptor blend films have not been studied thoroughly.
Phase separation processes of multi-component solutions during solvent evaporation are too complex to be explained by a simple mechanism.36,37 In the case of a solution that contains two components (e.g., a semiconductor polymer and fullerene derivative), various phase separation processes, such as liquid–liquid (L–L) phase separation and solid–liquid (S–L) phase separation, may occur simultaneously as the solvent dries. These processes and the processing conditions determine the final morphology of the blend thin films.36,38 The establishment of VPS in binary polymer blends at the early stage of film formation has been explained by the occurrence of surface-directed spinodal decomposition that induces one of the blend components to migrate toward the film surface.39–41 Such surface-induced L–L phase demixing in blends of conjugated polymers with fullerene has also been reported; here, fluctuations in the vertical composition due to surface-directed driving forces were shown.41,42 This L–L phase demixing can also cause characteristic drop-shaped domain structures as a result of spinodal-decomposition-initiated development of phase separation caused by capillary forces induced by fluid–fluid interactions.43 However, in the context of liquid phase separation processes including L–L and S–L demixing, the parameters that have critical influence on VPS have not been investigated systematically.
In this study, we investigated the process of VPS in blend films of various polymers with phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). Our goal was to identify the factors that critically affect the development of VPS in these blends. We systematically selected polymers with functional side chains for comparative study. In the ternary phase diagram, the interaction parameter, χ, between each polymer and PCBM, and the solubility of each polymer were the major features of the material that were compared, and they were found to be highly correlated with the development of VPS in polymer:PCBM blend films. We demonstrated the χ value between the polymer and PCBM to be the main factor affecting the VPS; in contrast, the crystallinity of polymers interrupted the development of VPS. Moreover, inclusion of additives in the solvent strongly affected the phase separation processes, increased the fluctuation of the composition of the active layer in the vertical direction. Finally, the dependence of the photovoltaic properties of devices containing these films on the vertically modulated morphologies was investigated. We believe that this study will contribute to optimizing the morphology of blend systems of conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives for organic optoelectronic applications.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Material properties
A ternary phase diagram can be used to describe phase separation processes in blend solutions of polymers with small molecules (Fig. 1). The Flory–Huggins equation for a ternary blend, i.e., (1)is an effective tool to predict phase separation processes.44 In this equation, G is Gibbs free energy, R is the ideal gas constant, T is absolute temperature, ϕi is the volume fraction of component i (1 = solvent, 2 = PCBM, 3 = polymer), and N2 and N3 are the effective molecular size of the components in the lattice sites. The ternary phase diagram shows the division of composition space by the bimodal line into single-phase and multiple-phase region. The compatibility between the polymer and PCBM can be also quantified as the parameter χ23, which describes the interaction between these two components.41,45 The χ23 parameter is correlated with the onset of phase separation when the solvent evaporates, because phase separation is triggered at the time of the solution crossing the coexistence region in the phase diagram. The phase diagram for a polymer–PCBM pair with a low χ23 value (i.e., relatively high compatibility) displays a large single-phase region, developing a small scale of phase separation with a low repulsive interaction between polymer and PCBM. However, the area of the unstable region in the ternary phase diagram has been found to become large for moderately large values of the interaction parameter χ23, with the blend solution quenching with a large penetration depth into the unstable region, and decomposing spinodically during evaporation of the solvent.46,47

When a polymer–PCBM blend thin film is processed by spin coating, the blend film morphology can develop by spinodal decomposition.39,48 Here, the phases of the polymer blend have been found to decompose through a vertically stratified structure as a consequence of strong attraction of one component for the surface, followed by a breakup of the vertical structure into large droplet-shaped domains due to interfacial instability between the different phases.39 However, surface-induced spinodal decomposition can lead to a vertically stratified lamellar structure before development of a large droplet-shaped morphology if the χ23 value is moderate.38,42 These ‘kinetically frozen’ lamellar profiles could be obtained experimentally because vitrification prevented breakup and lateral coarsening. In contrast, in polymer–fullerene blends that have very large values of χ23, the critical points in phase diagram have been shown to correspond to a high solvent fraction, thus allowing sufficient molecular mobility for breakup and coarsening to occur; as a result, a subsequent lateral phase separation into a drop-like shape was observed.41,43 Otherwise, a solidification of the polymer phase resulting from low polymer solubility was found to also induce S–L phase demixing during solvent evaporation.49 Therefore, the effects of L–L phase and S–L phase demixing on VPS should be studied.
First, we compared blends of PCBM with four different thiophene-based polymers, specifically with alkyl side chains of various geometries. These polymers included poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) with high regioregularity (91%) (P3HT-RR91), P3HT with random regioregularity (P3HT-RA), poly[3-(ethyl-5-pentanoate)thiophene] (P3EPT), and polybenzodithiophene-difluoro-benzothiadiazole (PBDT2FBT) (Fig. 2). Thiophene-based polymers have been widely used in investigations of morphology development.50 The miscibility of P3HT with PCBM is moderate, but is strongly dependent on the crystallinity of P3HT; although the completely amorphous characteristic of RA-P3HT can show mixed blend morphology with PCBM over a wide composition range, crystalline regioregular P3HT has limited miscibility with PCBM compared to regiorandom P3HT.16

The interaction parameters for the polymers and PCBM system were calculated using the surface energy method,38,41 in which the contact angle θ was used to determine the surface energies γ of thin films of the pure polymer and PCBM. The harmonic mean method was used to convert θ to γ.51 For apolar materials the Hildebrand solubility parameter δ is proportional to the square root of γ:52 (2)where K is the proportionality constant. Note that in general, once the value of K is established using known data on δ and γ of compounds of similar polarity, the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter can be evaluated according to the expression44 (3)where υseg is the volume of one lattice segment, kT is the thermal energy, and χs is the entropic contribution to the interaction parameter, which for a nonpolar polymer in a nonpolar solvent is typically between 0.3 and 0.4, with a value of 0.34 often used. The exact value did not significantly affect the outcome of the calculations performed in this work. γ was measured for layers of pure polymers and PCBM (Table 1) using K ∼ 116 × 103 m−1/2, which was determined from the measured data of γ values and referred data of δ values for compounds, polymers and PCBM, with similar polarity values and chemical integrity as for our compounds.38,41

The difference between the regioregularity of P3HT affected the γ values (27.1 mN m−1 for P3HT-RR91 and 31.5 mN m−1 for P3HT-RA) even though the two polymers have otherwise identical chemical structures. Loose packing of alkyl chains in amorphous P3HT phase might have affected γ and eventually χ.53 This hypothesis is consistent with the observed high miscibility of PCBM molecules with the amorphous phase of P3HT;54 note that such miscibility strongly affects phase separation processes during solvent evaporation. In addition, it was corroborated by the observation that the rate of diffusion of PCBM into P3HT upon thermal annealing at 150 °C was decreased in a pre-annealed crystalline P3HT layer.16 The P3EPT polymer was found to have a higher surface energy (39.0 mN m−1) than were observed for the P3HT polymers, due to oxygen atoms in its ester group.55 The PBDT2FBT-Th polymer was observed to have a low γ of 26.5 mN m−1, and relatively high χ, similar to that of P3HT-RR. However, the calculation of these χ values from the surface energy measurements used an approximation; therefore, in this study, a comparison of the relative χ values of the various polymers was considered to be more meaningful than the calculated values.
2.2. Vertical composition profiles
The ratios of the intensity of the sulfur peak to that of the carbon peak in dynamic secondary ion mass spectrometry (DSIMS) were measured to determine the vertical composition profiles of the four polymer:PCBM blend films (P3HT-RR:PCBM, P3HT-RA:PCBM, P3EPT:PCBM, and PBDT2FBT-Th:PCBM) (Fig. 3). To identify the polymers, the S− signals (m/q = 34) were detected and normalized to C− signals (m/q = 12) as a function of depth.
 Fig. 3  Normalized S− intensity to C− intensity versus depth profiles from the P3HT-RR91:PCBM, P3HT-RA:PCBM, P3EPT:PCBM, and PBDT2FBT-Th:PCBM blend films processed on silicon oxide substrate. 
The regioregular P3HT-PCBM film showed vertically stratified phase separation having a strongly air-segregated P3HT layer with a thickness of ∼20 nm, whereas the regiorandom P3HT-PCBM blend film showed a homogenous vertical profile. This difference between their vertical profiles was mainly attributed to the difference between the miscibility of P3HT-RA with PCBM (χ = 0.39) and that of regioregular P3HT-RR with PCBM (χ = 0.63); the immiscibility for P3HT-RR:PCBM induced a VPS in which P3HT segregated to the air surface because of the lower γ of P3HT than that of PCBM. The P3EPT:PCBM blend showed a homogeneous vertical composition profile due to its low χ of 0.44 and due to the high miscibility of the P3EPT with PCBM. The PBDT2FBT-Th:PCBM blend, with its large χ of 0.65, showed a surface-directed stratified morphology with the two P3HT-rich layers separated by ∼40 nm, similar to that of the P3HT-RR:PCBM film. These results suggest that the large difference in γ between this polymer and PCBM may have been responsible for inducing a stratified fluctuation in the composition that can be related to the surface-directed spinodal decomposition.42,56
Crystallization may not have been the major driving force for the development of the vertical composition fluctuation. While both the P3EPT:PCBM and P3HT-RA:PCBM blend films showed vertically homogeneous morphologies, only P3EPT showed distinct diffraction peaks from lamellar-stacked crystalline structure (Fig. S1†). The vertical phase fluctuation with a stratified structure was instead likely due to a high χ and resulting from surface-directed spinodal decomposition. Therefore, the occurrence of such decomposition in these systems may have been correlated with χ. The spinodal decomposition did not generally occur with low χ, so a homogenous vertical composition profiles in these cases could form. On the other hand, blends with moderately high χ values undergo surface-directed phase separation, leading to a vertically stratified morphology. However, in blends with very high values of χ (e.g., poly(9,9′-dioctylfluorene) (PF) with PCBM, χ = 0.9; poly(diketopyrrolopyrrolequinquethiophene) (PDPP6T) with PCBM, χ = 1, which are calculated based on surface energy method), the L–L phase separation has been found to occur strongly, according to the produced ternary phase diagrams, thus resulting in drop-shaped lateral phase morphologies.38,41
2.3. Polymer aggregation effect
During solvent evaporation, solid–liquid phase demixing also occurs by polymer phase aggregation if the concentration of the polymer becomes higher than its solubility limit in the solvent. Certain polymers can form a crystalline structure in aggregated solid phases during solid–liquid phase separation. The solubility of a polymer in a solvent is highly correlated with its structure features such as backbone rigidity and side-chain conformation.57,58 To explore how polymer aggregation affects the vertical composition profile, we compared polymers having the same backbone structure but having different side chains that we showed to have different effects on the solubility and crystallinity of the polymer.58
One factor that determines the crystallinity of conjugated polymers is the degree to which their backbones are planar. Variations in the bulkiness and mobility of side groups can alter the structural distortions of conjugated backbones; therefore the conformation and bulkiness of the side chains of polymers strongly influence the molecular packing and crystalline properties of their solid states.59,60 We synthesized benzodithiophene-difluorobenzothiadiazole (BDT-2FBT) polymers that included either alkylthienyl (BDT2FBT-Th) or alkoxy (BDT2FBT-O) side chains on the same backbone structure (Fig. 4a).

(c) Circularly-integrated XRD patterns from the neat PBDT2FBT-Th and PBDT2FBT-O polymer films. (d) Optical absorption spectra of pure P3HT-RR91 and P3HT-RR98 films. (e) Circularly-integrated XRD patterns from the neat P3HT-RR91 and P3HT-RR98 polymer films. 
Based on UV-vis absorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses, and theoretical calculations, we determined PBDT2FBT-Th to have higher steric hindrance among the bulky thienyl units of the side chains, a more-twisted polymer backbone, and a more disturbed intermolecular packing than PBDT2FBT-O. The flexibility of the alkoxy side group of PBDT2FBT-O apparently minimized the steric hindrance of the alkyl chain, so the backbone rigidity and crystallinity of this polymer were expected to have been increased.58 Both of these BDT-based copolymers exhibited vibronic bands at a wavelength of 640 nm in their solid-state spectra (Fig. 4b); such bands are typically attributed to intermolecular interactions of the polymer backbones. The PBDT2FBT-Th spectrum showed a weaker feature in the shoulder peak than did PBDT2FBT-O, with this weakness was attributed to conformational distortion enhanced by intramolecular repulsion between the sulfur atoms in the side chains and in the neighboring BDT units in PBDT2FBT-Th.
The integrated XRD profiles showed a big difference between the crystallinities of the two polymers (Fig. 4c). PBDT2FBT-Th exhibited only weak alkyl chain stacking diffraction peaks, located at q = 0.28 Å−1, and did not show π-stacking peaks. PBDT2FBT-O showed distinct alkyl chain stacking diffraction peaks (h00) at q = 0.35 Å−1 with a high degree of order, and also exhibited an obvious π–π stacking diffraction peak (010) at q = 1.67 Å−1. These results demonstrated that the bulky thienyl side chain disturbed the compact crystalline packing, whereas the flexible alkoxy side chain allowed the polymer backbone to stack with a high degree of order. The integrated area of the (100) alkyl-stacking peak resulting from the PBDT2FBT-O film was 100 times higher than that from the PBDT2FBT-Th film; this difference confirmed PBDT2FBT-O to be more strongly crystalline than PBDT2FBT-Th.
The crystallinity of P3HT polymers can be significantly affected by the geometrical distribution (e.g., regioregularity) of the side chains.61 The optical and crystalline properties of P3HT-RR91 and P3HT-RR98 were studied to quantify the differences between their molecular structures. The absorption spectra (Fig. 4d) of P3HT-RR98 exhibited three obvious vibronic bands at 530, 565, and 610 nm, which originated from its intermolecular electronic structure.62,63 These vibrational bands are attributed to well-ordered regions of P3HT polymer chains with pi–pi stacked structure. The vibronic bands were weaker in the P3HT-RR91 spectra than in the P3HT-RR98 spectra. The less regularly distributed side chains in P3HT-RR91 compared to P3HT-RR98 may have suppressed intermolecular packing.
To compare crystalline order of P3HT chains with different regioregularities in thin films, grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) was measured (Fig. 4e). The (100) peak, related to lamellar packing, was more intense in the P3HT-RR98 film than in the P3HT-RR91 film, indicating higher degree of crystal packing in the former. To quantitatively analyze the crystallinity in the P3HT films, the circularly integrated XRD profiles of the RA-, RR91-, and RR98-P3HT films were compared. The integrated area of the (100) peak resulting from the P3HT-RR98 film was three times higher than that from the P3HT-RR91 film after background subtraction. Although the integrated peak area does not quantitatively evaluate the crystallinity of a polymer film, the calculation suggested the P3HT-RR98 film to be more crystalline than the P3HT-RR91 film.
The vertical composition profiles of PBDT2FBT-O:PCBM and PBDT2FBT-Th:PCBM blend films were measured by using DSIMS (Fig. 5a). The film containing PBDT2FBT-Th showed a large wave-shaped fluctuation in the vertical composition profile (Fig. 5a); this type of fluctuation is the distinguishing feature of surface-directed spinodal phase separation.42 The vertical compositional waves were measured to have a wavelength of 37 nm, a normalized peak-to-valley ratio of 1.82 through three maxima, and a total thickness of 80 nm. The vertically stratified four-layer structure resulted from surface-directed phase separation driven by the difference in the γ values of the components. In contrast to the PBDT2FBT-Th:PCBM film, the PBDT2FBT-O:PCBM film displayed much weaker vertical stratification, with a wavelength of 25 nm and a normalized peak-to-valley ratio of 1.04 despite the similar surface energy levels of the PBDT2FBT-O and PBDT2FBT-Th polymers. This result showed polymer crystallization to compete with liquid–liquid phase separation and to significantly affect vertical phase separation.

These crystallinity-related effects were also confirmed in the P3HT films. The depth profiles indicated weaker vertical composition modulations in the P3HT-RR98:PCBM film than in the P3HT-RR91:PCBM blends. The weakly crystalline P3HT-RR91:PCBM blend film showed a large fluctuation in the vertical composition profile (Fig. 5b) with a strong segregation of P3HT at the air-exposed surface. In contrast, the vertical composition profile of the highly crystalline P3HT-RR98:PCBM blend film fluctuated less strongly and with smaller amplitudes than did the composition profile of the P3HT-RR91:PCBM film. We also confirmed the composition distribution at the air-exposed surface of the blend films using X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS); the XPS spectra of the P3HT-RR98:PCBM blend film showed oxygen intensity comparable to that of the neat PCBM film. However, the P3HT-RR91:PCBM blend film exhibited no oxygen peak, which indicated that P3HT aggregates segregated to a greater extent in the P3HT-RR91:PCBM films than in the P3HT-RR98:PCBM film (Fig. S2†).
The measured surface energies of the four polymers did not differ considerably (PBDT2FBT-Th, 25 mN m−1; PBDT2FBT-O, 26 mN m−1; P3HT-RR91, 25 mN m−1; P3HT-RR98, 26 mN m−1) (Table 2), so there should be another parameter, except interaction parameter, related to the interruption of surface-directed phase separation. We speculate that the high crystallinities of the PBDT2FBT-O and P3HT-RR98 polymers contributed to the interruption of surface-directed vertical phase separation. Solid–liquid demixing during film formation, induced by low solubility of the polymer, inhibited liquid–liquid phase separation that would have otherwise occurred as a result of surface-directed spinodal decomposition. We also confirmed that the lateral morphologies of the four polymer:PCBM blend films showed the nanophase-separated morphologies containing fibrillar polymer crystallites by using TEM measurements (Fig. S3†). We conclude that a large difference between the surface energy of polymer and that of fullerene can induce spinodal decomposition as a form of vertical phase separation, but that such phase separation can be inhibited by solid aggregation if polymer is poorly soluble.

2.4. Solvent additive effect
In OPVs, solvent additives have been widely used to control the BHJ morphology.64 The use of solvent additives affects the modulation of the vertical composition distribution.32 We investigated the effect of the solvent additives, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN), on the vertical composition profiles of the polymer:PCBM blend films. All the depth profiles were normalized to the average S− signals calculated in the range from the air-exposed surface to the buried interface for clear comparison of the depth profiles.
For the PBDT2FBT-Th:PCBM blend film, addition of DIO or CN in solution strongly affected the resulting vertical composition profiles (Fig. 6a and b). In the PBDT2FBT-Th:PCBM film supplemented with DIO, the amplitude of the vertical composition fluctuation increased from 0.13 to 0.45, and the wavelength from 45 nm to 55 nm. The PBDT2FBT-Th:PCBM film with CN showed a strongly composition-graded profile with continuously decreasing polymer concentration from the air-exposed surface to the buried interface. These results indicated that solvent additives helped VPS to develop strongly over a large scale. However, when the PBDT2FBT-O:PCBM film was used, addition of DIO or CN had negligible effects on their vertical composition profiles.

We also observed the effect of DIO and CN on the vertical composition profiles of the P3HT:PCBM blend films. Processing the P3HT-RR91:PCBM films with DIO or CN strongly affected the vertical composition gradient, and resulted in a stronger aggregation of P3HT near the air-exposed surface, relative to the same films processed without the additives (Fig. 6c). In particular, the P3HT-RR91:PCBM film processed with DIO showed a strong gradient in the composition, with a continuously decreasing concentration of P3HT from P3HT-segregated at the air-exposed surface to P3HT-depleted at the buried interface. The addition of CN also induced strong P3HT aggregation with the increased vertical fluctuation. However, the highly crystalline P3HT-RR98:PCBM film displayed a weaker vertical composition gradient than did the P3HT-RR91:PCBM film (Fig. 6d) even with the addition of DIO or CN. On the other hand, the well-mixed P3HT-RA:PCBM and P3EPT:PCBM blend films did not display vertically fluctuating profiles when DIO or CN was added (Fig. 6e and f).
These results for the PBDT2FBT:PCBM and P3HT:PCBM blends suggested that the phase separation occurred by the following mechanism. First, DIO or CN may have increased the vertical range over which liquid–liquid phase separation of the blend solution developed, resulting in an increase in the extent of vertical phase separation. The low volatility of DIO and CN may have been a critical factor affecting the vertical phase separation by decreasing the rate of solvent evaporation and guaranteeing that the solution developed more liquid-phase separation. Moreover, the addition of DIO or CN, which dissolve polymers less than does the host solvent (DCB), expanded the border line of the phase separation region in the ternary phase diagram. This change may have led to the increase in the extent of liquid–liquid phase separation during solvent evaporation. However, the blends with high miscibility between the polymer and PCBM (i.e., low χ) did not develop vertical composition fluctuations even when a solvent additive was used. Also, in the highly regioregular P3HT and PBDT2FBT-O polymer blend films, vertical segregation seemed to be strongly hindered by polymer aggregation and crystallization and not to be promoted by the use of additive. Therefore, we infer that the effect of surface-directed liquid–liquid phase separation might compete with phase aggregation induced by low solubility.
2.5. Degree of vertical phase separation
For a quantitative comparison of the vertical composition modulation, we defined the degree of VPS as (4)where N is the number of components, Ii is the SIMS intensity of each component, and IAVG is the average intensity calculated from the air-exposed surface to the bottom of the film.
The DoVs of the blend films successfully quantified the development of vertical composition modulation over a certain range of lengths (Fig. 7a). The DoVs of the blends clearly distinguished the vertically stratified profiles from the homogeneous profiles. The vertically modulated PBDT2FBT-Th:PCBM (DoV = 0.050) and P3HT-RR91:PCBM blends (DoV = 0.130) were determined to have large DoVs, whereas the vertically homogeneous P3HT-RA:PCBM (DoV = 0.009) and P3EPT:PCBM (DoV = 0.013) films showed lower DoVs (Fig. 7b). Moreover, the DoVs of PBDT2FBT-Th:PCBM and P3HT-RR91:PCBM films exhibited greater DoVs as DIO or CN was added, while P3HT-RA:PCBM and P3EPT:PCBM films showed negligible changes with the use of solvent additives. Therefore, we assert that χ, when determined using the surface-energy method, can be considered to be a measure of the strength of vertical stratification in the blend films. However, the value of χ can only be used for comparison in this study because it can be measured in various ways.
 Fig. 7  (a) The calculated degree of vertical composition fluctuation, . The DoV values are organized to represent (b) DoV vs. χ for PBDT2FBT-Th:PCBM (χ ∼ 0.65), P3HT-RR91:PCBM (χ ∼ 0.63), P3HT-RA:PCBM (χ ∼ 0.39), and P3EPT:PCBM (χ ∼ 0.44) and (c) DoV vs. solubility of polymers in 1,2-dichlorobenzene solvent for PBDT2FBT-O (12.8 g L−1), P3HT-RR98 (22.6 g L−1), PBDT2FBT-Th (33.1 g L−1), and P3HT-RR91 (50.5 g L−1) which have similar χ ∼ 0.65. 
Interestingly, for the polymers, PBDT2FBT-Th, PBDT2FBT-O, P3HT-RR91, and P3HT-RR98, which all have similar χ values of ∼0.7, the solubilities were inversely related to the DoV of the blend films (Fig. 7c). This relationship supports the hypothesis that aggregation of polymer resulting from its low solubility hindered the development of VPS induced by formation of the L–L phase separation. Moreover, VPS developed over a large scale when the blend was processed with a low-volatility solvent additive such as DIO and CN only when the solubility of polymer was sufficiently high.
2.6. Vertical phase separation scheme
Based on the characterizations of vertical composition profiles, a schematic morphological model is proposed to explain the phase separation in the polymer–fullerene blend systems (Fig. 8). In the ternary phase diagram, L–L demixing and S–L demixing can occur.
 Fig. 8  Schematic presentation of the morphology-forming process. The BHJ solution is well dissolved in the beginning liquid state forming a homogenous phase; quick removal of solvent leads to spinodal-decomposition-initiated liquid–liquid phase demixing (I) or ‘aggregation of polymer content’-induced solid–liquid phase demixing (II); the use of solvent additive affect vertical phase separation more developed or make aggregations to form fibrils with further solvent removal. 
In the proposed model, L–L demixing is initiated by spinodal decomposition, which is driven by the instability of the association of the two immiscible components that have a high interaction parameter χ. A negative second derivative of the chemical potential versus concentration in the spinodal decomposition region yields spontaneous diffusion processes that drive the phase separation at a very early stage of solvent evaporation. In this study, we measured the difference between the surface energy values of the components to determine χ; this difference can be correlated with the immiscibility of the components. Moreover, at the substrate, this surface energy difference can induce a surface-directed phase redistribution because the drive to minimize the thermodynamic stability forces the component with lower surface energy to move to wet the interface with air. For this reason, the interaction parameter in this study was well correlated with surface-directed vertical phase separation. It should be noted that the quite high χ of polymer and fullerene resulted in a drop-shaped strongly phase-separated morphology; therefore, a moderate χ value was found for the development of surface-directed spinodal-decomposition.
S–L demixing in this model is induced by nucleation and aggregation. Aggregation is triggered if the concentration of the solution reaches its solubility limit, and nucleation requires a minimum size of the aggregate in order for the crystalline phase to grow. Polymers with low solubility in the given solvent tend to aggregate easily during rapid solvent evaporation. When a polymer aggregates strongly during solvent drying, the L–L demixing process is inhibited by the occurrence of the dominant S–L demixing, and in this way surface-directed spinodal decomposition can be interrupted. Because, through the nucleation and growth mechanism, phase separation does not propagate in any specific direction, the resulting film morphology in this model does not show development of a vertical composition gradient.
Interestingly, when DIO or CN was used, the VPS developed on a large scale only if the VPS was initiated by surface-directed spinodal decomposition. Solvent additives had a complicated effect on phase separation: they strengthened polymer aggregation at an early stage of solvent evaporation even in the solution state;43 they also prolonged phase demixing, and thereby allowed the blend to develop phase separation on a large scale. In this study, in particular when the film was processed with solvent additives, the VPS resulting from surface-directed spinodal decomposition achieved a bilayer-like structure with the vertical composition gradient widespread throughout the inside of blend film.
2.7. Electrical properties
To assess the influence of the vertically phase-separated morphologies of the photoactive layers on device performance, we compared the photovoltaic properties of the standard and inverted devices, which have photoactive layers with similar morphologies. OPVs with a standard architecture (ITO/MoO3/active layer/LiF/Al) and inverted architecture (ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag) were fabricated. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the photovoltaic devices were measured under 100 mW cm−2 illumination.
Additive processing and device structure both affected the photovoltaic properties of the PBDT2FBT-O:PCBM- and PBDT2FBT-Th:PCBM-based devices (Fig. 9 and Table 3). The PBDT2FBT-O:PCBM devices processed with and without CN showed similar PCE values, close to 4.7% for the standard structure and 4.3% for the inverted structure. Processing with CN increased the short-circuit current density Jsc and the PCE values of both the standard and inverted-type PBDT2FBT-O devices. This improvement may have been a result of the increased crystallinity of the polymer due to the addition of CN. The similar photovoltaic properties of the standard and inverted-type devices can be explained by the vertically homogeneous profiles characterized above.

In contrast to the case of PBDT2FBT-O, the PCE of the PBDT2FBT-Th device was strongly affected by the device architecture. The electrical properties of the PBDT2FBT-Th devices with the standard and inverted structures were fairly similar when CN was not included. However, when processed with CN, the standard-type PBDT2FBT-Th device showed an obvious decrease in Jsc and fill factor (FF) compared to the device processed without CN. In contrast, the inverted-type PBDT2FBT-Th device processed with CN showed a large increase in Jsc and FF compared to the devices processed without CN. These results corresponded well with the characterized vertical composition profiles described above and shown in Fig. 6a and b. The PBDT2FBT-Th:PCBM film developed a large vertical composition gradient when processed with CN, and this gradient had a strong effect on the photovoltaic properties. These results revealed the correlation between the vertical composition gradient and the photovoltaic properties. The architecture of the device with a vertical composition gradient critically affected its photovoltaic properties, due to the direction in which photogenerated charge carriers were transported. Device architectures chosen for transporting charge carriers toward opposite charges would likely experience high levels of bimolecular recombination.
To investigate the charge recombination characteristics, the relationship between current density J and voltage V was measured as a function of the intensity of the illumination (Fig. S4†). Jsc typically follows a power-law dependence on light intensity Pin; i.e., Jsc ∝ PinS. In general, a linear dependence of J on Pin (S ≈ 1) suggests negligible second-order recombination, whereas a sublinear dependence (S < 1) indicates that charge-transport behavior is limited by second-order recombination.15,65 In the PBDT2FBT-O:PCBM device, the standard structure yielded an S value of 0.986, and the inverted structure produced an S value of 0.987; i.e., the charge recombination characteristics were unaffected by the device structure. In contrast, in the PBDT2FBT-Th:PCBM device, the standard structure produced an S value of 0.955, and the inverted structure showed an S of 0.982. The reduced S value of the standard device was attributed to inefficient charge collection, which in turn was due to unfavorable component wetting near the target electrode (e.g., polymer segregation at cathode), which affects charge recombinations.26 Consequently, bimolecular recombination losses seemed to affect charge transport in the structures with a vertical gradient of components; this hypothesis is consistent with the reduced FF in this standard-structured device compared to the highly-efficient inverted structure in PBDT2FBT-Th:PCBM devices.
To investigate changes of photogenerated charge transients, the recombination dynamics was experimentally determined by using transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements; specifically, photovoltage decays following a laser perturbation under open circuit were monitored.66 The small perturbation of charge carrier lifetime τΔn was extracted by fitting the exponential voltage decay at various illumination conditions. To investigate the effect of vertical composition gradient on the charge recombination dynamics, we focused only on comparing the TPVs of photovoltaic devices fabricated with the solvent additive CN. For the PBDT2FBT-Th films, which showed a vertical composition gradient, the charge carrier lifetime of the PBDT2FBT-T devices with the standard structure was measured to be 0.049 μs, 1/14th that of the 0.73 μs lifetime measured for the device with the inverted structure. This difference originated from the considerable accumulation of polymer at the air-exposed surface. This short charge carrier lifetime in the standard device indicated that the nongeminate recombination rate increased due to the inefficient charge transport direction (holes toward the buried interface and electrons toward the air-exposed surface). In contrast, similar charge carrier lifetimes of 0.70 μs and 1.3 μs were measured, respectively, for the standard and inverted-type devices containing the vertically homogeneous PBDT2FBT-O films.
These results indicated that the strong dependence of charge collection property of PBDT2FBT-Th devices on the device structure can be correlated with the vertical gradient of the composition, i.e., in which the composition differs between the regions at the air-exposed surface and the buried interface. We also obtained the similar results from P3HT-based devices. The photovoltaic properties of the P3HT-RR91:PCBM device which has the strong vertical gradient of the composition exhibited strong dependency of PCE on the device structure, while the P3HT-RR98:PCBM device showed similar photovoltaic properties between the standard and inverted structures (Fig. S5†). Therefore, the vertical composition profile should be considered carefully to optimize photovoltaic device processing and structures for efficient charge collection.
3. Conclusion
We demonstrated that the development of a vertical composition gradient in a polymer–PCBM blend film was strongly affected by the miscibility of the components, the polymer crystallinity, and the processing condition, and can hence be predicted by these three features. The main factor triggering a vertical phase separation was the interaction parameter χ between the polymer and PCBM, yet polymer crystallization hindered the formation of vertical stratification in the polymer–fullerene blend film. In addition, the use of a DIO or CN solvent additive strongly affected the vertical fluctuation of the composition of the active layer and produced a morphology with a strong vertical gradient of the composition. The vertical gradient was strongly correlated with photovoltaic properties including especially the bimolecular recombination rate. Therefore, suitable electrode architectures are required to increase the efficiency of the charge collection in devices using vertically segregated morphologies. This study has provided information essential for guiding the optimization of photogenerated charge carrier extraction and hence achieving highly efficient OSCs.
4. Experimental
4.1. Material preparation
We purchased poly[3-(ethyl-5-pentanoate)thiophene-2,5-diyl] (P3EPT) (4023, Mn = 29.8 kg mol−1, PDI = 2.11, RR = 92%) and poly-3-hexyl-thiophene (P3HT) samples having three levels of regioregularities from BASF and Rieke Metals: P3HT-RR98 (Sepiolid TM P200, Mn = 18.3 kg mol−1, PDI = 1.89, RR > 98%); P3HT-RR91 (Sepiolid TM P100, Mn = 23.8 kg mol−1, PDI = 1.95, RR = 91%); and P3HT-RA (4007, Mn = 23.1 kg mol−1, PDI = 3.36, RR = 59%) where MW is the weight average molecular weight, PDI is the polydispersity index, and RR is the regioregularity. PBDT2FBT-O (Mn = 24.4 kg mol−1, PDI = 1.83) and PBDT2FBT-Th (Mn = 21.2 kg mol−1, PDI = 1.27) were synthesized following a procedure described previously.52 The regioregularity was measured using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The molecular weights and polydispersities (PDI) of the polymers were estimated with gel permeation chromatography (GPC) by using monodisperse polystyrene as the standard and chlorobenzene (CB) as the eluent. Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) (99.5% pure; Nano-C) was used as received. 1,8-Octanedithiol, 1-chloronaphthalene, and 1,2-dichlorobenzene were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
4.2. Sample preparation
P3HT:PCBM was dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (1:1 weight ratio, 40 mg mL−1 in total) and stirred at 55 °C for 14 h, and then a volume of 20 μL of solvent additive, 1,8-octanedithiol or 1-chloronaphthalene was added to 1 mL of the solution, which was stirred for 30 min. P3EPT:PCBM (1:1 weight ratio, 40 mg mL−1 in total) and PBDT2FBT:PCBM (1:1.5 weight ratio, 25 mg mL−1 in total) were dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene. The solutions were spin-coated onto piranha-cleaned silicon wafers.
4.3. Device fabrication
Indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates were cleaned sequentially with detergent, distilled water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol. After UV-ozone treatment, for the standard structure (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PCBM/LiF/Al) poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Baytron P VP AI4083, Clevios) was spin-coated onto the substrates and then baked at 120 °C for 30 min in a convection oven. The thicknesses were measured to be the thickness of ∼40 nm using a surface profiler (Alpha-Step 500, Tencor). The polymer and PCBM blend solution was spin-coated onto the PEDOT-PSS-coated substrates at 800 rpm for 90 s, then soft-baked at 70 °C for 10 min. To deposit the electrodes on the active layer, the samples were transferred into a vacuum chamber (pressure < 1 × 10−6 Torr), and then LiF (0.6 nm)/Al (100 nm) was deposited sequentially on top of the thin films by thermal evaporation.
For the inverted structure (ITO/ZnO/polymer:PCBM/MoO3/Ag), ZnO nanoparticle solution, synthesized following a procedure described previously,67 was spin coated onto the substrates after being filtered through a 0.2 μm polytetrafluoroethylene filter, and was then thermally annealed at 200 °C for 1 h. The polymer and PCBM blend solution was spin coated onto the ZnO-coated substrates. After transfering the active layer-coated films into a vacuum chamber, MoO3 (3 nm)/Ag (100 nm) was deposited sequentially on top of the thin films by thermal evaporation.
The electrical characteristics were measured with a source/measure unit (Keithley 4200) in the dark and under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 solar illumination in a N2-filled glove box. Light was generated with an Oriel 1 kW solar simulator referenced by using Reference Cell PVM 132 calibrated at the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
4.4. Film characterization
Dynamic secondary ion mass spectrometry (DSIMS) measurements were taken performed by using an SIMS system (IMS 6F, CAMECA, France) at the National Center for Nanomaterials Technology (Pohang, Korea). The impact energy was 15 keV and Cs+ ions were used as the primary ions; the analysis area was 30 μm, and the raster size was 200 μm × 200 μm, accepting negatively charged secondary ions from the central 20% of the crater area. 1H, 12(C−), 18(O−), 30(Si−), 18(F−), and 34(S−), ions were detected. The samples were sufficiently thin so that no charge compensation was required. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction was performed at the 5A and 9C beamlines at Pohang Accelerator Laboratory. UV-vis spectra were recorded on a Varian CARY-5000 UV-vis spectrophotometer.
4.5. TPV measurements
The transient photovoltage (TPV) decays of the devices were measured under open-circuit conditions and under illumination from the solar simulator with adjustable intensities. A small perturbation generated by a nitrogen dye laser (OL-4300, Optical Building Blocks Corporation, λ = 536 nm, energy per pulse at 5 Hz = 1.45 mJ, pulse width ∼ 1 ns) was used. The transient decay signals were recorded by using a digital oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS3054C). The samples were mounted in ambient atmosphere during the measurements.
