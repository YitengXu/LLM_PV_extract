    , Accepted 1st May 2020First published on 4th May 2020AbstractOn account of their superior thermal stability and applicable band gap (∼1.7 eV), the inorganic halide CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have aroused intense interest in recent years. Nevertheless, the CsPbI3 PSCs still face a problem of high energy loss (Eloss) which leads to low open-circuit voltage (VOC). Herein, we developed efficient CsPbI3 PSCs through guanidine hydrobromide (GABr) post-treatment on the surface of CsPbI3 films. After optimizing, a supreme power conversion-efficiency (PCE) of 18.02% was obtained, which was higher than the original one (16.58%). By further studying, the characterization of passivation was found, which led to a reduced nonradiative recombination rate. Besides, the band alignment between CsPbI3 and the interface layer was also optimized, leading to the decreased electron transport barrier for electron collection, and superb hole contact for furnishing a driving force in the hole transfer and preventing electrons from flowing in the opposite direction.
Introduction
As a new generation of solar cells, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted lots of attention in recent years.1–4 It turns out that the supreme power conversion-efficiency (PCE) of hybrid PSCs has been raised to an extra-high level beyond 25%.5–8 Nevertheless, these hybrid PSCs have been troubled by poor thermal and photochemical stability which mainly caused by unstable organic cations.9–12 As a consequence, using inorganic Cs+ substitutes for the organic cations has been testified to be a splendid method to stabilize the PSCs.13–16
Among all inorganic Pb-halide perovskites, CsPbBr3 (ref. 17–20) and CsPbI2Br21–25 exhibited extraordinary thermal stability, but they showed an inappropriate band gap (Eg). Although the cubic phase CsPbI3 with an ideal Eg of about 1.72 eV is suitable for photovoltaic application, its unendurable phase instability brings other problems.26–29 In the initial stage, lots of literature studies had been reported about promoting the stability and performance of CsPbI3 based PSCs. For instance, by adding sulfobetaine zwitterions to the CsPbI3 precursor solution, Wang and co-workers improved the phase stability of CsPbI3 in air and realized a stabilized PCE of 11.4%.30 Ling and co-workers used a variety of inorganic cesium salts as surface passivation agents for CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dot solar cells and exhibited a PCE as high as 14.1%.31 Later, Wang et al. fabricated high quality and stable α-phase CsPbI3 films with 15.7% PCE through solvent-controlled growth of the precursor films.32 Most recently, the metastable distorted black phase (lower symmetry orthorhombic) based CsPbI3 has aroused much enthusiasms for its excellent photoelectric properties and stability.33–36 Our group fabricated a distorted black phase CsPbI3 film with an Eg of 1.69 eV. By optimizing the material composition and annealing process, the corresponding PSCs achieved a PCE of 15.1% with much enhanced stability.37,38
Later, researchers found that decreasing the device energy loss and optimizing the device band alignment through the components and interface engineering could further enhance the device performance. For example, Wang et al. incorporated Br− ions into the CsPbI3 film to suppress bulk trap-assisted nonradiative recombination and lattice strain relaxation. In consequence, the fabricated PSC shows a champion PCE of 17.17%.39 Zhao et al. reported that phenyltrimethylammonium bromide and chlorine treated CsPbI3 PSCs achieved a high PCE of about 19%.40,41 Besides, the guanidinium cation (GA+) has also been widely used as a passivator to suppress the trap state, because it has hydrogen bonds and can combine with under-coordinated iodine.42,43 Therefore, Wang et al. introduced guanidinium thiocyanate to induce a micron-sized MAPbI3 film and effectively passivate its grain boundaries to reduce non-radiative recombination. Finally, a MAPbI3-based PSC with a champion PCE 16.37% was obtained.44 Even though great progress has been achieved, the highest PCE of all inorganic CsPbI3 PSCs remains much lower than the organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs.
Here, a post-treatment process via guanidine hydrobromide (GABr) is applied to the CsPbI3 absorbing film. We discover that the GABr treatment on the surface of CsPbI3 film is an efficient method to achieve an admirable PCE by reducing the nonradiative recombination rate and optimizing the band alignment.
Results and discussion
In our work, an original film and optimized films disposed with different concentration gradients of GABr were fabricated and labelled as follows: original (film without GABr), GABr-1 (1 mg mL−1 GABr), GABr-2 (2 mg mL−1 GABr), GABr-3 (3 mg mL−1 GABr), and GABr-4 (4 mg mL−1 GABr). The device structure is exhibited in Fig. 1a which consists of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass/TiO2/GABr disposed CsPbI3/poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA)/Au, and the cross-section scanning electron microscope (SEM) image is presented in Fig. 1b. Here, the flat TiO2 film was deposited on the FTO glass serving as the electron-transport layer (ETL). After that the CsPbI3 film was fabricated upon the flat TiO2 film by using a one step-coating process as the light absorber layer. Then the PTAA film was employed as the hole-transport layer (HTL), and the gold cathode was evaporated upon the HTL.

The typical J–V curves and photovoltaic parameters are given in Fig. 1c and Table 1. As shown in Table 1, owing to the increased open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF), the PCEs of the films were improved to 17.39% and 18.02% when treated with GABr-1 and GABr-2 while the original one was 16.58%. But conversely, when the GABr concentration was increased to 3 mg mL−1 and 4 mg mL−1, the PCEs started to decrease rapidly. Although high concentration of GABr (GABr-3 and GABr-4) could hoist the VOC continuously, the FF and short-circuit current density (JSC) were brought to a rather low level because of the accumulation of GA+ on the surface of the CsPbI3 film that hindered the carrier transport and influenced the contact with the PTAA film (so the GABr-4 treated film was not investigated in the following discussion).

For the purpose of verifying whether there was a direct change in the crystal structure after surface treatment, we conducted the X-ray diffraction (XRD) of different CsPbI3 films, and the results were presented in Fig. 1d. It showed that there was no structural change in general, and the GABr applied CsPbI3 film could still form a perovskite structure. This demonstrated that large GA+ (2.78 Å) mainly stayed on the CsPbI3 surface and did not bring any change to the lattice,45 even though the CsPbI3 film was annealed after coating with the GABr solution. And we also noticed that the XRD peak slightly shifted to a higher 2θ (from 29.02° to 29.06°), indicating that a small amount of smaller Br− (1.96 Å) was substituted for bigger I− (2.2 Å) in the lattice sites,46,47 resulting in the contraction of the crystalline lattice. According to early reported studies,48,49 the shrunk lattice could improve the stability of CsPbI3 and suppress bulk trap-assisted nonradiative recombination, which is also consistent with the experimental results in this work.
SEM images (Fig. 2a–h) were obtained to study the morphology evolution of CsPbI3 films after being treated with different kinds of GABr concentration. Obviously, when GABr was applied, some small size crystal grains appeared on the surface of CsPbI3 films. The appearance of small size grains was caused by the ion exchange between Br− and I− on the top layer of the CsPbI3 film after GABr post-treatment, which led to the formation of the ultra-thin GA-CsPbIxBry two-dimensional perovskite film,50 that could optimize the surface defects of the film and reduce the nonradiation recombination, so as to improve the device performance. Additionally, it has been confirmed that the moderately doped Br− can also passivate the film, which leads to the reduced nonradiative recombination rate.39 At first, when the GABr doping concentration is low, the ion exchange occurs only at the concentration of the grain boundaries. When the concentration increases, the generated GA-CsPbIxBry two-dimensional perovskite film can cover the surface of the CsPbI3 film uniformly. However, when the concentration of GABr is too high, the ion exchange on the surface layer is already saturated, and there will be excess GABr accumulated on the surface of the film, affecting the carrier transport and resulting in performance degradation. Notably, the sharpness of SEM images tended to worsen, which may be caused by the GABr-CsPbI3 films exhibiting some surface charging as a result of the insulator effect of the GA+ cation.9 Besides, a low rate of de-nucleation/dissolution of unstable small CsPbI3 during the Ostwald ripening process might be another reason of the formation of the small-sized grains.44
 Fig. 2  SEM and AFM images of the CsPbI3 films treated with different GABr concentrations: (a, e, and i) original; (b, f, and j) GABr-1; (c, g, and k) GABr-2; (d, h, and l) GABr-3. 
Atomic force microscope (AFM) images (Fig. 2i–l) were used to study the roughness of the obtained films. As we can see, the surface roughness of the films decreased (from 21.6 nm to 12.1 nm) when the GABr concentration increased from 1 mg mL−1 to 4 mg mL−1. It was clear that the GABr modified CsPbI3 film had a smoother surface than the original one. Although the perovskite layer could probably be dissolved partially while using GABr treatment, which was induced by the weak polarity of IPA,51 in our work the films treated with a small amount of IPA in a short period of time were smoother, and the adverse effect on performance was negligible. The decreased surface roughness possibly led to better contact between the HTL and perovskite layer and further reduced the nonradiative current losses.52,53
In order to further ascertain the impact of the GABr post-treatment on the cells we fabricated, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were acquired, as is shown in Fig. 3a. After treatment with GABr, the elements N and Br were distinctly observed on the surface. Fig. 3b shows the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of the original and optimized CsPbI3 films. The peaks at 3136 cm−2 and 3421 cm−2 are the out-of-plane deformation vibration absorption peaks of N–H; 1654 cm−2 are CN stretching vibration absorption peaks in guanidine CNH; 1567 cm−2 are bending vibration absorption peaks of N–H; 1456 cm−2 and 1375 cm−2 are C–N stretching vibration absorption peaks,54 and the above peaks are attributed to the characteristic absorption peaks of the GA+ functional group. Notably, all samples were briefly exposed to air during preparation before the FTIR spectroscopy test; therefore, the original sample showed two hydroxyl absorption peaks at 1639 cm−2 and 3352 cm−2 while they were absent in other samples treated with GABr. This also indicated that GABr post-treatment improved the water resistance of CsPbI3.
 Fig. 3  Characterization and optical properties of the original and GABr treated CsPbI3 films: (a) XPS survey spectra; (b) FTIR spectra; (c) absorption spectra; (d) PL spectra. 
To investigate the photo-physical characteristics of different concentration gradient GABr treated CsPbI3 films, optical absorption (Fig. 3c) and photoluminescence (PL, Fig. 3d) were carried out as well. With the rising GABr concentration, the positions of the perovskite film absorption edge and PL peak have a small blue shift that could be observed clearly. This blue shift could happen when the smaller Br− was doped into the CsPbI3 lattice during post-annealing, which was in accord with the results of XRD.55,56 More than that, the PL spectra of GABr-1 and GABr-2 came out with two peaks after the GABr post-treatment which was caused by the formation of GA-CsPbIxBry, and the intensity of this peak rose as GA-CsPbIxBry increased.50,57 When the ultra-thin GA-CsPbIxBry film was completed and the excess GABr accumulated on the surface of the film, we observed a distinct shifted peak at 675 nm. Besides, it might also be attributed to the decrease of spontaneous radiative recombination between trap states, which might cause enhanced VOC, so we consider it as a secondary reason.58 As shown in Fig. S1,† the time-resolved PL (TRPL) decay profiles were obtained for the FTO/TiO2/perovskite films treated with GABr with different concentration gradients. It was clear that the treated films had a shorter charge carrier lifetime in general. The average recombination lifetime (τave) is estimated using the following equation:59 (1)
And the τave for the original, GABr-1, GABr-2 and GABr-3 are 11.3 ns, 1.5 ns, 0.78 ns and 2.3 ns, respectively. The smallest τave of the GABr-2 treated CsPbI3 film indicated a more effective electron extraction from CsPbI3 to TiO2 than the original CsPbI3 film.
Furthermore, in order to make the photo-excited carrier dynamics clearer, we used femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fs-TA) to characterize the original and optimized films (FTO/TiO2/CsPbI3). As shown in Fig. 4a–d, the induced absorption change (ΔA) intensity of the ground-state bleaching (GSB) signal increased first, and then decreased with prolonging delay time, indicating that the photo-excited carriers were extracted out in a short time.60 And the optimized film (GABr-2) also showed a slight blue-shift in agreement with the XRD patterns and PL spectra mentioned above for small Br− doping.61 Then we analyzed the decay kinetics of GSB, as shown in Fig. 4e, and the result is consistent with TRPL analysis, indicating that the GABr treated CsPbI3 film can effectively expedite charge extraction and collection from the absorber layer to ETL.62 This phenomenon should be ascribed to the suppressed bulk trap-assisted nonradiative recombination after GABr post-treatment. As told by Leijtens et al., the optimized film showed slow trap mediated recombination compared with the original one, which allowed more charge carrier collection, far greater Fermi level splitting and larger VOC.63

Fig. S2a and d† show us the band gaps of the two samples (1.72 eV for the original and 1.74 eV for the optimized, respectively) derived from the optical absorption spectra. The feasible reasons for the enlarged band gaps from 1.72 eV to 1.74 eV can be ascribed to the little amount of Br− in GABr partly replacing I− in CsPbI3,49,64 which was also proved by XRD analysis and PL spectra. For the purpose of investigating how the bands change between the original film and the optimized film, the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were carried out. The UPS results revealed the work functions (φ = VO − EF, VO is the vacuum energy level and EF is the Fermi level) of both films, which can be derived from the low kinetic energy cut-offs in the secondary emission features,65 as shown in Fig. S2b, c, e and f.† The energy band results are presented in Table S1.† Finally, the schematic of energy levels of the original and optimized devices are shown in Fig. 5a.

As we all know, the performance of the PSCs is mainly affected by the band gap of the perovskite absorber layer and the energy levels of other interfacial layers. Clearly, the magnified Eg is one of the reasons that lead the VOC to increase after the GABr treatment.66 Besides, the band alignment was optimized by decreasing the electron transport barrier between the CsPbI3 layer (from −4.15 eV to −3.99 eV) and TiO2 ETL (−4.01 eV), leading to more efficient electron collection. Meanwhile, such reasonable interfacial band alignment also showed a superb hole contact on CsPbI3 layer (from −5.87 eV to −5.73 eV) and PTAA HTL (−5.14 eV), which will furnish a driving force in the hole transferring and prevent electrons from flowing in the opposite direction (prevent the generation of a reverse photocurrent).50,67
The typical J–V curves of the optimized device (treated with GABr-2) were measured in both the forward and reverse scan directions demonstrating the highest PCE of 18.02% with little hysteresis (exhibited in Fig. 5b, with the key parameters summarized in Table 2). The small hysteresis could arise from the effective passivation of grain boundaries, and then suppress carrier aggregation in the boundaries.68–70 The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was also measured in the optimized device in the range from 325 to 800 nm, and the integrated JSC (19.62 mA cm−2) is shown in Fig. 5c. It should be noted that JSC calculated using the EQE curves is consistent with the J–V measurements (errors less than 5%), indicating that the latter is well calibrated. Fig. 5d shows the PCE distribution histogram of 20 individual optimized CsPbI3 PSCs as we fabricated, and their narrow distribution suggests an excellent reproducibility. For the device stability, the related PSCs still hold to 92% of their initial value after the devices were stored under ambient conditions (20–30% relative humidity) for 1 month (shown in Fig. S3†). The results suggest that the fabricated inorganic PSCs are suitable for practical applications.

Conclusion
In summary, we have successfully used GABr post-treatment on the surface of CsPbI3 films to fabricate inorganic PSCs with enhanced performance. Compared with the original device, the VOC and the FF of the GABr-2 optimized device rose up to 1.125 V (1.086 V) and 78.9% (75.3%), respectively, resulting in a high PCE of 18.02% (16.58%). Finally, the enhancing mechanism is clearly studied, and we believe such an approach could also efficiently promote the performance of other types of PSCs.
