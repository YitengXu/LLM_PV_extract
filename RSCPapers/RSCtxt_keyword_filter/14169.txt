    , Accepted 27th September 2018First published on 27th September 2018AbstractThe interface between perovskites and charge transport layers is crucial for the power conversion efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). We report for the first time the exploration of three novel fullerene derivatives, N-ethyl-2-arylvinyl-5-methyl fulleropyrrolidine (NAMF) with H, Cl or Br substitutions on the pyrrolidine side-chain (namely NAMF-H, NAMF-Cl and NAMF-Br), via a low cost and one-step reaction from C60, as the interlayer to enhance the efficiency and eliminate hysteresis in planar heterojunction PSCs. The crystallinity of MAPbI3 perovskite cast on these interlayer materials was found to be similar, but the grain size increased and the grain boundaries reduced. All three fullerene derivatives have well-aligned LUMO levels that facilitate electron transport from the perovskite to TiO2, and reduce trap density and charge recombination in PSCs, leading to enhanced device efficiency and reduced hysteresis. Notably, the NAMF-Cl interlayer was found to chlorinate the TiO2 electron transport layer, leading to an enhanced PCE of 19.2% in the reverse scan and 17.7% in the forward scan, which were greater than those of PCBM-based PSC devices. Our work adds a new direction to the design of new fullerene derivatives with favorable physical and electrical properties as interlayer materials to improve the performance of PSCs.
Introduction
Organometal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted widespread attention due to the rapid development of their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) with low material cost.1–4 Since the first employment of perovskite as a dye molecule in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) achieving an unstable efficiency of 3.8% in 2009,2 the record PCE of PSCs has increased to 23.3% in 2018.5
PSCs employing a mesoporous TiO2 electron-transport layer (ETL) usually require preparation at a high-temperature over 500 °C. In comparison, planar structured PSCs can be fabricated via a low-temperature route on a flexible substrate, and are therefore a promising device architecture.6–9 To this end, low-temperature processed TiO2 is one of the commonly used ETL materials.10 However, there are two critical drawbacks of low-temperature processed TiO2: the undesirable energy barrier for charge injection11 and the intrinsic low charge mobility, which result in a low charge transfer rate and high charge recombination in the device.12 This leads to inefficient electron injection from the perovskite layer to TiO2, causing charge accumulation at the relevant interface and therefore notorious hysteresis behavior when measuring PSCs at different scan rates and scan directions.13 To resolve these issues, interface engineering has been applied to planar heterojunction PSCs to reduce charge accumulation at the electrode interface and facilitate electron transport and extraction.14,15 For example, Lin et al. applied PCBM as the interlayer and reported a device efficiency increase from 8.4% to 15.4%16 and Zhou et al. applied C60 as the interlayer to increase the device efficiency from 15.9% to 18.2%.17 PCBM enhanced the device efficiency owing to its higher electron mobility, conductivity and more suitable lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level.18,19 However, since PbI2 was poorly wetted on PCBM, the perovskite film coverage is not sufficient.20 PCBM derivatives such as PCBB-2CN-2C8,21 PCBA22 and PCBB-OEG23 have also been successfully applied as the interlayer to enhance charge transport at the interface. For example, Li et al. used electron-withdrawing cyano groups on PCBB-2CN-2C8 to pacify the oxygen vacancy.21 Dong et al. used the carboxyl group on PCBA to form a chemical bond with TiO2, with the low solubility of PCBA in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) ensuring the stability of the PCBA layer during the subsequent solution deposition of the perovskite.22 Xu et al. proposed that the -OEG group of PCBB-OEG can form a hydrogen bond with the –NH3 group of MAPbI3 to anchor it on the surface of perovskite grains, therefore enhancing the quality of the perovskite crystal.23 Despite the promising properties of PCBM and its derivatives, the complex synthesis process, low yield and high cost limit their large volume applications.24 To address these issues, it is imperative to explore low-cost fullerene derivatives to replace high-cost PCBM and PCBM derivatives and prepare PSCs with high efficiency and stability.25–27
Here we designed three novel fullerene derivatives via a one-step reaction from C60, each having a different substituent element (hydrogen, chlorine or bromine, named NAMF-H, NAMF-Cl and NAMF-Br, respectively) on the pyrrolidine side-chain of N-ethyl-2-arylvinyl-5-methyl fulleropyrrolidines (NAMFs). We incorporated NAMF-H, NAMF-Cl or NAMF-Br as the interlayer between TiO2 and the perovskite in planar PSC devices. The reduced LUMO level of these fullerene derivatives facilitates electron transfer from the perovskite to TiO2. NAMF-Cl was found to have electrical conductivity and mobility values close to those of PCBM, and was able to chlorinate the underlying TiO2 layer. A generally increased grain size from ca. 260 nm to over 310 nm was observed in the perovskite films cast on all our fullerene derivative interlayers. All our fullerene derivatives can reduce hysteresis in planar PSCs, with the NAMF-Cl interlayer leading to a maximum PCE of 19.2% in the reverse scan, with minor hysteresis that outperforms the PCBM interlayer. The increased PCE and reduced hysteresis were found to be associated with the reduced interfacial resistance and trap density, and increased charge recombination resistance.
Results and discussion
We herein designed three new fullerene derivatives based on N-ethyl-2-arylvinyl-5-methyl fulleropyrrolidines with attached pyrrolidine side-chains, named NAMF-H, NAMF-Cl and NAMF-Br where H, Cl and Br, respectively were the substituent elements of the phenyl group. The one-step synthetic procedures are detailed in the experimental section, and the chemical structures of the three fullerene derivatives are shown in Fig. 1. The pyrrolidine side-chains with phenyl units are selected to improve the solubility and the film-forming ability, whilst providing good resistance against moisture. The nitrogen atom, carbon–carbon double bond and phenyl unit ensure the electron-donating ability, which can enhance the LUMO energy level of the fullerene derivatives compared to C60. The halogen element can potentially interact with both the perovskite and TiO2 layers, and the effects will be demonstrated below. Whenever possible, we have compared the properties and effects of NAMF-H, NAMF-Cl and NAMF-Br with those of PCBM.

Quantitative values of ESP are in arbitrary units. (e–g) XPS spectra of TiO2 and TiO2/fullerene derivative bilayers. 
The LUMO and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of these three fullerene derivatives were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. S1†), and the corresponding values are listed in Table 1. The LUMO levels of NAMF-H, NAMF-Cl and NAMF-Br are −4.05, −4.08 and −4.13 eV, and their HOMO levels are −5.95, −5.91 and −5.91 eV, respectively. Compared to those of PCBM and NAMF-Br, the LUMO levels of NAMF-H and NAMF-Cl are higher and can therefore potentially increase the Voc of PSCs due to the more favorable band alignment with the perovskite.28–31 The optical band gap (Egopt) of a fullerene can be estimated using Eoptg = 1240/λpeak, where λpeak is the peak wavelength from the PL spectrum of fullerene derivative thin films (see Fig. S2†). The Eoptg values of the PL spectrum of PCBM, NAMF-H, NAMF-Cl and NAMF-Br are 1.68, 1.73, 1.71, and 1.70 eV, respectively. These values are slightly lower than the electronic band gap (Eg) obtained by CV measurements; however these changes due to different substitutions follow the same trend and verify the reliability of our CV measurements.

To gain further insight into the electrochemical properties of these fullerene derivatives, the density functional theory (DFT) method was used to compute the molecular orbitals, electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution and dihedral angles. Based on the optimized geometries of the fullerene derivatives at the DFT B3LYP/DND//M06-L/DND level,32 the LUMO levels of NAMF-H and NAMF-Cl were calculated to be −3.29 and −3.43 eV (Fig. S3†), which are higher than those of PCBM (−3.84 eV) and NAMF-Br (−3.61 eV). Again, the changes of LUMO levels from DFT calculations are consistent with those from the CV measurements. The pyrrolidine side-chains can reduce π-conjugation in the C60 cage, and effectively increase the LUMO energy level.15,33,34 ESP distributions of these fullerene derivatives are illustrated in Fig. 1d. It was found that the negative ESP distributes in the nitrogen atom, π-conjugated phenyl group and halogen atoms. Compared to that of NAMF-H, the negative ESP distribution of NAMF-Cl and NAMF-Br moved from the phenyl unit to the halogen atom. Because of the higher electronegativity of the chlorine atom than the bromine atom, the negative ESP distribution of NAMF-Cl is more concentrated than that of NAMF-Br. A recent study has showed that a bulky substituent will result in weak intermolecular interaction due to the steric hindrance effect, which will also lead to the reduction of Voc.35 To compare the steric hindrance effect of different halogen atoms and the co-planarity of pyrrolidine side chains in these fullerene derivatives, we have calculated the dihedral angles of the CC bond of the fullerene derivatives (shown in Fig. S3† and Table 1). The CC dihedral angle of NAMF-H is 1.53°, a value that is smaller than that of NAMF-Br but larger than that of NAMF-Cl, which indicates that the introduction of chlorine atom enhances the co-planarity of the pyrrolidine side chain but the bromine atom will reduce it. The steric hindrance and co-planarity will affect the charge transport and Voc, which is evidenced by our results discussed in the following section.
Electron mobilities of these fullerene derivatives were obtained by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method using electron-only devices (ITO/TiO2/fullerene derivatives/Ca/Ag) (Fig. S1(f)†).36 PCBM, NAMF-H, NAMF-Cl and NAMF-Br have an electron mobility (μe) of 3.36 × 10−3, 3.73 × 10−4, 1.44 × 10−3 and 3.61 × 10−4 cm2 v−1 s−1, respectively. The electron mobility of NAMF-Cl is comparable to that of PCBM, and is much higher than those of NAMF-H and NAMF-Br, presumably because the better co-planarity of the pyrrolidine side-chain and the concentrated electronegativity of chlorine atoms both favor electron transport.37 Lower mobility will cause space-charge buildup and recombination losses,38 and has a negative impact on the enhancement in Jsc and FF.39 The trend of electron conductivity of PCBM (4.72 × 10−3 ms cm−1), NAMF-H (1.61 × 10−3 ms cm−1), NAMF-Cl (2.80 × 10−3 ms cm−1) and NAMF-Br (2.43 × 10−3 ms cm−1) is the same as that of electron mobility, with a higher conductivity also contributing to efficient charge transport and extraction and leading to superior photovoltaic performance of these PSCs.
To study the interaction between TiO2 and fullerene derivatives, high-resolution XPS spectra of Ti 2p, Cl 2p and Br 3d peaks from the TiO2/fullerene derivative bilayer and pure fullerene derivative thin films were obtained and are shown in Fig. 1(e–g) and S4(a–c).† The binding energies of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 are ca. 458.7 and 464.4 eV, respectively, which are consistent with the literature report.40 XPS investigation has confirmed that titanium exists in the Ti(IV) oxidation state. The Ti 2p peak shifts towards a higher core-level binding energy after the deposition of the fullerene derivatives (NAMF-H, NAMF-Cl and NAMF-Br) on the TiO2 surface (see Fig. 1e), suggesting that more negative charges are around the Ti4+ ions after putting halogens in contact with TiO2. Notably, there is a significant peak shift of Cl 2p from 201.8 (200.2) eV to 200.2 (198.4) eV, which suggests that the anionic Cl was incorporated into TiO2 to chlorinate it.41 The Cl 2p peaks can be resolved into two peaks. The main contribution at 198.4 eV is attributed to the anionic Cl via OTi–Cl linkages, formed by the substitution of oxygen in the TiO2 lattice.42 The minor contribution may be attributed to the chemisorbed chlorine. This NAMF-Cl interlayer can passivate the trap states on TiO2, leading to an enhanced device efficiency, and the results will be presented in a later section.
We then characterized the morphology of TiO2 capped with different fullerene interfacial layers with perovskite films grown on top, as shown in Fig. 2, S5 and S6.† The surface roughness of TiO2 can be reduced slightly after capping with a fullerene layer. The perovskites grown on fullerene derivatives have significantly reduced root-mean-square (RMS) roughness from 17.3 nm to below 10 nm (see Fig. S5†), an effect that will contribute to reducing the current leakage of devices and charge recombination at the perovskite interface.43,44 The introduction of a fullerene derivative interlayer can facilitate the growth of high-quality perovskite films with larger grain sizes, consequently reducing grain boundaries (see images in Fig. 2 and S6,† and the statistical size distributions of grains plotted in Fig. 2g, S6 and S7†). Taking NAMF-Cl as an example, without its presence, the average grain size ranges from 100 to 600 nm with the peak grain size around 260 nm. In the presence of NAMF-Cl, the grain size ranges from 100 to 500 nm, with the peak grain size around 320 nm (see Fig. 2g). It is therefore evident that the crystal grain size increased and became more uniform in comparison to the perovskite film cast on TiO2, a morphology that plays a favorable role in determining the device efficiency of planar heterojunction PSCs.16,45 X-ray diffraction peaks at 2θ of 14.0, 28.4 and 31.9° were observed for MAPbI3 films, and are assigned to the (110), (220) and (310) crystal planes, respectively (Fig. 2h), in accordance with the literature report of MAPbI3.46 The weak diffraction characteristic peak at 2θ of 12.6° has been assigned to PbI2 residues, which are commonly observed in perovskite films prepared by a two-step preparation process.47 The intensity differences of MAPbI3 and PbI2 peaks in films cast on TiO2 with or without the fullerene derivatives were insignificant, which suggests that there was no obvious difference in terms of the perovskite crystallinity.

We found that the device performance with a planar n–i–p architecture of ITO/TiO2/fullerene derivative/MAPbI3/spiro-MeOTAD/Ag depended on the molecular structure of the fullerene derivatives. The best-performing J–V curves of devices with different fullerene interlayers and their device metrics are shown in Fig. 3, and the average photovoltaic parameters with standard deviations (s.d.) were obtained based on 20 cells for each set and are shown in Table 2. For those devices incorporating fullerene derivatives, s.d. values around 0.5% were obtained which illustrates good reproducibility of these devices. Without any fullerene interlayer, the PSC device has a PCEmax of 18.6% in the reverse scan and 13.8% in the forward scan, exhibiting a notable hysteresis of ΔPCE ∼ 5%. When a fullerene interlayer was applied, the PCE in the reverse scan increased slightly toward and beyond 19%, but the PCE in the forward scan increased more via the enhancements of Voc and FF, leading to reduced hysteresis (see Fig. 3). In particular, when NAMF-Cl was employed as the interlayer, the champion device efficiency was substantially improved to 17.7% in the forward scan and ΔPCE of just ∼1%, with the values of Jsc, Voc and FF achieved being 22.7 mA cm−2, 1.08 V and 78.6%, respectively. This performance is greater than the devices incorporating a PCBM interlayer. The Voc of NAMF-H, NAMF-Cl and NAMF-Br based PSCs is much higher than that of pristine TiO2 based PSCs, which can be explained by their higher LUMO energy levels. The higher FF obtained for NAMF-Cl could be related to the higher electron mobility and conductivity of NAMF-Cl than those of NAMF-H and NAMF-Br. The steady state photocurrent output at a voltage close to the maximum power point was also measured, with the corresponding PCE and current density monitored as a function of time up to 100 seconds. As shown in Fig. 3, the PCEs for devices based on PCBM, NAMF-H, NAMF-Cl and NAMF-Br interlayers are 17.8%, 17.7%, 18.7%, and 17.1%, respectively, all higher than 16.2% for the device without any fullerene interlayer, in accordance with the PCE changes from the J–V curves, supporting that NAMF-Cl is an efficient interlayer for planar PSCs.

Device stability remains as a big challenge for PSCs, and hinders their outdoor applications. The storage and operational lifetimes of our unencapsulated PSCs were also evaluated briefly. For the storage lifetime test, four sets of devices were stored under ambient conditions at a relative humidity of 50 ± 10% and an average temperature of 25 °C and then tested every day for a period of two weeks. As shown in Fig. S8,† the NAMF-Cl and PCBM based devices demonstrated good stability over a period of 14 days and retained ca. 90% of their initial efficiencies, while the conventional TiO2 based device exhibited a rapid degradation of PCE (a drop of ca. 50% after storage for 14 days), and the NAMF-Br and NAMF-H based devices retained 75% and 65% of their initial efficiencies. The operational lifetimes of these PSCs under MPP, 1 sun illumination and exposure to ambient environment were plotted in Fig. S9.† For the TiO2 based PSC without any interfacial modifications, the PCE dropped to zero after continuous operation over 10 min only. Interfacial modifications employing fullerene derivatives can substantially improve the operational lifetime, with the NAMF-Cl based device out-performing the NAMF-Br, NAMF-H and PCBM based devices. These results demonstrate that introducing a fullerene derivative interlayer can effectively enhance the stability of PSCs. TiO2 has been reported to reduce device stability under UV or full-spectrum light illumination.48,49 The poor coverage of the perovskite layer on TiO2 will lead to a large amount of trap states, and also accounts for the poor stability of PSCs.50,51 Rather than a gradual decrease of the device efficiency, the efficiency of our MAPbI3 PSCs in this work dropped abruptly to zero for a period up to 2 hours only (see Fig. S9†). We tentatively relate this behavior to the voltage induced ion migration under the MPP testing conditions, which will degrade the MAPbI3 crystals and lead to the failure of PSCs.52 For MPP testing under 1 sun, an operational lifetime around 2 hours was also observed when the devices were operated in air at a high RH of 100%.53 Note that the perovskite in the above work is Cs5(FA83MA17)95Pb(I83Br17)3, whilst the composition of our MAPbI3 perovskite is much simpler with a higher rate of ion migration. Although the testing protocols can vary in different reports, our results demonstrate that a fullerene derivative interlayer enhances the storage and operational stabilities of PSCs through the formation of a high quality perovskite layer, as well as the modification at the interface to reduce light and bias induced degradations.
We continue to evaluate the charge transport properties of these PSCs using steady state photoluminescence (PL) measurements of perovskite films cast on different fullerene derivative surfaces, as shown in Fig. 4a. Whilst the PL intensity of the perovskite film cast on TiO2 is high, this PL peak is quenched significantly in the presence of the fullerene derivative interlayer. The quenching of the PL peak intensity can originate from the morphology of the perovskite layer, and the efficient charge transfer at the perovskite/TiO2 interface. Whilst the enlarged grain size in the perovskite layer cast on fullerene surfaces will in principle increase the PL intensity, the experimentally observed PL quenching is an indication of efficient charge transfer from the perovskite to the fullerene interlayer. Fig. 4a shows that the PL quenching efficiency is much higher in TiO2/NAMF-Cl, NAMF-Br and NAMF-H/perovskite films than in the TiO2/PCBM/perovskite film, illustrating that they offer efficient charge transfer at the interface.

Dark current measurements were conducted to study the current leakage in these PSCs (Fig. 4b). In the presence of fullerene derivatives, the dark current-density is much lower than that without an interlayer, indicating that the current leakage is reduced and more photocurrent will flow through the device.54Fig. 4c shows the capacitance–voltage (C–V) curves, the slope of which is a straight line that is inversely proportional to the interfacial charge density, and the intercept with the x-axis is related to Voc.55 The slope of the NAMF-Cl-based device (−1.5 × 10−17) is larger than that of NAMF-Br (−1.2 × 10−17) and NAMF-H (−1.3 × 10−17)-based devices, suggesting a lower interfacial charge density, and thus less charge accumulation and recombination at the perovskite/TiO2 interface. The intercept with the x-axis of the NAMF-H, NAMF-Cl and NAMF-Br-based devices is 1.04, 1.06, and 1.03 V, respectively, values that are all higher than 0.92 V of the device without an interlayer, therefore verifying the reliability of Voc from our J–V measurements. The electron-only devices were fabricated with PCBM/Ag as the counter-electrode. The dark current data were obtained as a function of applied voltage to extract the trap density. The dark J–V curves in Fig. 4d can be divided into three parts: the ohmic region, the space-charge limited current region and the trap-filling limited region.56,57 The trap density can be determined from the trap-filled limited voltage (VTFL) using the equation: VTFL = entL2/2εε0, where L is the perovskite film thickness, ε is the relative dielectric constant of MAPbI3 (taken as 32), and ε0 is the vacuum permittivity (8.854 × 10−12 F m−1).58 The trap density nt of NAMF-H, NAMF-Cl, NAMF-Br-based devices was calculated to be 1.77 × 1016, 1.60 × 1016 and 1.83 × 1016 cm−3, values that are all lower than 3.38 × 1016 cm−3 of the device without an interlayer, which again confirms the lowest interfacial charge recombination in the NAMF-Cl-based PSC.
Fig. S10† shows the impedance spectroscopy characteristics. The data were fitted to a relatively simple equivalent circuit model (see the insets of Fig. 4e and f), which consists of a series resistance (Rs) and a recombination resistance (Rrec) at the fullerene/perovskite interface. The fitting data of Rs and Rrec for the fullerene derivative-based devices in the range of 0.2–0.8 V are plotted in Fig. 4e and f. We found that the Rs values of fullerene derivative-based devices are smaller than those of the device without an interlayer. The NAMF-H based device showed the lowest Rs, consistent with its best PL quenching effect. The Rrec values of PCBM- and NAMF-Cl-based devices are larger than those of the NAMF-Br- and NAMF-H-based devices, independent of the voltage applied in our measurements, which indicates the most reduced recombination rate in their PSC devices, and is consistent with our device efficiency results. Hence, NAMF-Cl is most effective at reducing charge traps at the TiO2/perovskite interface and suppresses charge accumulation more efficiently than NAMF-Br and NAMF-H.59
The charge recombination and trapping properties of our PSCs can be further evaluated through open-circuit voltage decay and dark current extraction measurements. The plot in Fig. 5a can be divided into two parts: the illumination conditions, where the device is illuminated to reach the open circuit voltage and hence establish a photostationary state; and the dark conditions, where the light is then switched off and the decay in Voc is monitored as a function of time. The fast voltage decay process is a result of bimolecular recombination of electrons and holes, and the slow decay process is dominated by trap-assisted recombination within the device. The fast voltage decay rates of all devices are similar, while the difference in the second stage suggests different levels of traps in these devices. The second-stage voltage decay rate of the NAMF-Cl based device is the lowest, suggesting the least amount of traps in the device that leads to the slowest voltage decay. Intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) measurements (Fig. S11†) were carried out to provide dynamic electrical information on our PSCs at open-circuit voltage under modulated small-amplitude illumination. In the Bode plots (Fig. S10†) of relevant PSCs, the peak at high frequency is ascribed to the dominant charge recombination process inside the perovskite active layer. The carrier lifetime (τn) can be determined using τn = 1/ωmin,60 where ωmin corresponds to the peak frequency in the Bode plot. Therefore τn of PCBM, NAMF-H, NAMF-Cl and NAMF-Br-based devices is 1.6 × 10−5, 8 × 10−6, 1.0 × 10−5 and 6.4 × 10−6 s, respectively, and that of the device without an interlayer is 3.2 × 10−6 s. In this context, the trap reduction effect of the PCBM or NAMF-Cl interlayer is considered to be the predominant cause of long-lived charge carrier lifetimes. In Fig. 5b, the dark charge extraction plot can be divided into four steps: conditioning (to release residual charges in the device), charge injection (with an applied bias of 0.2 V), fast charge extraction (of free charges), and slow charge extraction (of trapped charges). During the fourth step, a higher level of charges has been extracted from the device indicating that more charges were trapped in the device. The charges extracted from PCBM, NAMF-H, NAMF-Cl, NAMF-Br and pure TiO2 -based devices are ca. 5 × 10−7, 4 × 10−7, 2 × 10−7, 6 × 10−7 and 9 × 10−7 C cm−2, respectively. The dark charge extraction measurements again support that the NAMF-Cl-based device traps the least amount of charges due to its efficient charge transport at interfaces.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have designed novel fulleropyrrolidine-based fullerene derivatives NAMF-H, NAMF-Cl and NAMF-Br as interlayers between TiO2 and perovskite in order to prepare planar PSC devices with high efficiency and low hysteresis. The reduced LUMO level of these fullerene derivatives facilitates electron transfer from the perovskite to TiO2, and therefore reduces charge accumulation at the ETL interface which otherwise results in serious hysteresis. We demonstrate that NAMF-Cl possesses favorable physical and electrical properties, which can facilitate charge carrier transport and reduce trap-mediated recombination in PSC devices. A superior performance of 19.2% in the reverse scan and 17.7% in the forward scan was achieved using NAMF-Cl as the interlayer, and this was greater than that of the PCBM-based device. Our study offers a new strategy to design novel fullerene derivatives with an easy synthetic route and low cost, while modifying both the TiO2 and perovskite layers towards reduced charge accumulation at the interface and increased grain size in the bulk of the perovskite layer, properties that favor efficient charge transport and suppress charge recombination towards high device performance.
Experimental section
Materials
The synthetic details of methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I or MAI) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) solution can be found in a previous study.14 Lead(II) iodide (PbI2, 99.9%) was purchased from You Xuan Ltd. Phenyl-C60-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis (N,N-di-pmethoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) were purchased from Luminescence Technology. Bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide lithium salt(Li-TFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
The synthetic details of fullerene derivatives (NAMF-H, NAMF-Cl, and NAMF-Br) can be found in a previous study.61 A brief synthetic procedure for fulleropyrrolidines is as follows: 3 from diethylamine 2a. C60 (36.0 mg, 0.05 mmol), aromatic aldehyde 1 (0.50 mmol), diethylamine 2a (52 μL, 0.50 mmol), and Mn(OAc)3·2H2O (40.2 mg, 0.15 mmol) were added to a 50 mL round-bottom flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a magnetic stirrer. After they were completely dissolved in 10 mL of chlorobenzene by sonication, the resulting solution was placed in an oil bath preset at 120 °C and stirred under ambient conditions. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was employed to carefully monitor the reaction and to stop the reaction at the designated time. The reaction mixture was filtered through a silica gel plug to remove any insoluble material. After the solvent evaporation in vacuo was completed, the residue was separated via a silica gel column with carbon disulfide/dichloromethane as the eluent to afford first unreacted C60, and then the fulleropyrrolidine (Table 3).

Device fabrication
Patterned ITO glass (resistance ca. 15 Ω sq−1) was cleaned by ultrasonication sequentially in water, ethanol, and isopropyl alcohol for 10 min each, and then further treated with ultraviolet–ozone for 10 min to remove organic contaminants. The details of spiro-OMeTAD based devices, including TiO2 film, PCBM film, MAPbI3 film and spiro-OMeTAD film fabrication and deposition are detailed in our previous report.14 Finally, 100 nm-thick silver electrodes were deposited on the top of the devices through a metal shadow mask by thermal evaporation at a pressure of 10−7 torr. The active area of all solar cells was 0.04 cm2. For the NAMF-H, NAMF-Cl and NAMF-Br based devices, the interlayers were formed by spin coating their solutions (3 mg mL−1 in a mixed solution of CS2:CB = 1:1 for NAMF-H and NAMF-Br, 10 mg mL−1 in CB) at 4000 rpm for 30 s.
Characterization
The density functional theory (DFT) method was used to compute electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution and dihedral angles in these fullerene derivatives. X-ray diffraction spectra were measured with an X-ray diffractometer (D8 Advance, Bruker, Germany) using Cu Ka radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. The surface morphology was characterized using a SPM (NT-MDT, Russia). The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using a PL microscopic spectrometer (Flex One, Zolix, China); the excitation source of PL utilizes a 532 nm CW laser. Impedance measurements were obtained using a ModuLab XM electrochemical workstation (AMETEK, UK) at a series of voltages with an amplitude of 10 mV from 1 MHz to 100 Hz under one AM 1.5 G illumination conditions. Equivalent circuit simulations were conducted using the software package ZView (Scribner Associate, Inc., Country). Capacitance–voltage, open-circuit photovoltage decay, IMVS and dark charge extraction measurements were also carried out using a ModuLab XM electrochemical workstation (AMETEK, UK). The CV measurements were carried out using a platinum–carbon electrode in acetonitrile solution containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate as the electrolyte and Pt wire as the reference electrode. The measurements were calibrated using ferrocene (Fc). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed under vacuum by using a Thermo Fisher Scientific PHI Quantera II system with a monochromatic Al Kα source. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices were measured under simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2) using a Newport 3A solar simulator, with light intensity calibrated using a silicon solar cell certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL, USA). J–V characteristics were recorded using J–V sweep software developed by Ossila Ltd. (Sheffield, UK) and a Keithley 2612B source meter unit (Company, Country). The devices were masked with a metal aperture mask to accurately define the test area on each pixel and to eliminate the influence of any edge effects. The stabilized power output versus time of the devices was measured by applying a bias near the maximum power output point.
