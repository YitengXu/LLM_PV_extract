    , Accepted 2nd December 2021First published on 3rd December 2021AbstractWith the aim to enhance the photovoltages and efficiencies of dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on porphyrin dyes, a dialkoxy-substituted highly twisted tetraphenylethylene (TPE) moiety has been introduced into the donor unit of a porphyrin dye to suppress dye aggregation and charge recombination. Thus, based on our previously reported porphyrin dye XW43, a dialkoxy-TPE moiety has been introduced into the phenothiazine donor to afford XW71. Compared with the diethyleneglycol substituent in XW43, the bulkier dialkoxy-TPE unit in XW71 is more beneficial for suppressing charge recombination. The alkoxy chains on the TPE moieties in XW71 are extended outward from the molecule and folded toward the porphyrin macrocycle, respectively, favorable for suppressing dye aggregation and charge recombination. As a result, the VOC was dramatically improved from 0.750 V (XW43) to 0.765 V (XW71). On this basis, the substituents surrounding the porphyrin macrocycle have been optimized to further improve the VOC and the efficiencies. Thus, XW72 and XW73 have been synthesized by replacing the dodecyloxy moieties on the meso-phenyl substituents of XW71 with two diethyleneglycol (DEG) chains and double straps, respectively. As a result, XW72 and XW73 exhibit a gradually improved VOC of 0.772 V and 0.777 V, respectively, and a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.0% has been achieved for XW73. Upon coadsorption and cosensitization, the efficiency can be further enhanced to an outstanding value of 12.3% for the XW73 + CDCA + XC3 system.
Introduction
Photovoltaic technology has been developed as the most promising solution for the energy crisis. In this respect, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) featured with the advantages of eco-friendliness, low cost, and high efficiency, have attracted significant attention.1–5 Among the components of a typical DSSC device, the dye plays a key role in harvesting sunlight. In the past few decades, numerous dyes, including ruthenium complexes,6–10 metal-free organic sensitizers11–18 and porphyrin dyes,19–29 have been systematically developed. Among them, as the imitators of chlorophylls, porphyrins exhibit strong absorption and become crucial candidates for the construction of efficient DSSCs.
For designing efficient dyes, the typical D–π–A framework composed of an electron donor (D), a conjugated bridge (π) and an electron acceptor (A), has been shown to be effective for extending the absorption and enhancing the photovoltaic performance,30–36 and introduction of bulky substituents (e.g. alkyl and alkoxy chains) can suppress the charge recombination between the oxidized electrolytes and injected electrons.37–41 In this respect, the propeller-shaped tetraphenylethylene (TPE) moiety42–45 has been used as the substituent by Li and co-workers to afford a series of metal-free organic sensitizers, exhibiting excellent photovoltaic performance under room light illumination (27.5%).46 Based on this background, we herein report the introduction of alkoxy modified TPE into the phenothiazine donor of our previously reported porphyrin dye XW43 (ref. 47) (Fig. 1) with the purpose to further enhance its VOC and efficiency.
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures of XW43 (ref. 47) and XW71–XW73. 
Compared with the two diethyleneglycol (DEG)-substituted phenyl groups in XW43, the alkoxy chains on the TPE moieties in XW71 are extended outward from the molecule and folded toward the porphyrin macrocycle, respectively, favorable for suppressing dye aggregation and charge recombination, resulting in the obvious improvement in VOC from 0.750 to 0.765 V and an obviously enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.9%. On this basis, the substituents surrounding the porphyrin macrocycle have been optimized to further improve the VOC and the efficiencies. Thus, XW72 was synthesized by replacing the two dodecyloxy chains in XW71 with two diethylene glycol (DEG) chains with the aim to trap the Li+ cation and thus electrostatically attract the oxidized electrolyte to reduce charge recombination on the TiO2 surface.47,48 Furthermore, XW73 was synthesized by replacing the two dodecyloxy chains in XW71 with double straps to better protect the Zn core and thus suppress the charge recombination (Fig. 1).49 As a result, XW72 and XW73 exhibit an improved VOC of 0.772 V and 0.777 V, respectively, higher than the 0.765 V obtained for XW71, and the highest PCE of 11.0% has been achieved for XW73. Upon coadsorption with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and cosensitization with the reported organic dye XC3 (ref. 50) (see Fig. S1† for the chemical structure), an outstanding efficiency of 12.3% has been obtained for the solar cell based on XW73 + 2 mM CDCA + 0.3 mM XC3. These results provide a new approach for constructing efficient porphyrin sensitizers based on the bulky and highly twisted TPE entity.
Results and discussion
Synthetic procedures
The Sonogashira coupling reactions of the porphyrin acetylenes 1a–1c with the alkoxy-TPE modified phenothiazine bromide D-Br,46,51 followed by hydrolysis of the ester groups, afforded the target sensitizers XW71–XW73. All the new intermediates and target products have been characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, IR and high-resolution mass spectroscopies (Fig. S9–S35†).
Optical and electrochemical properties
The absorption spectra of the porphyrin dyes XW71–XW73 and the co-sensitizer XC3 in THF are shown in Fig. 2, with the data listed in Table 1. Each porphyrin dye shows a typical intense Soret band around 450 nm and moderate Q bands with the maximum absorption near 670 nm. Compared with the reference XW43,47 the new porphyrin dyes XW71–XW73 exhibit broader Soret and Q bands with higher molecular absorption coefficients (ε), which will be favorable for improving the light-harvesting ability. With respect to the absorption spectra of XW71–XW73 in THF, the corresponding ones of the TiO2 films are slightly broadened (Fig. S2†) with negligible blue-shifts, in contrast to the more obvious blue-shifts observed for most porphyrin dyes.39,52 This observation may result from the well-defined anti-aggregation character of the bulky and highly twisted alkoxy-TPE moieties introduced into the donors of the porphyrin sensitizers.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to evaluate the energy levels of XW71–XW73 to assess the driving forces for electron-injection and dye regeneration (Fig. S4†). As a result, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of XW71–XW73 are found to lie in the range of 0.81–0.85 V (Fig. 3 and Table S1†) vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), which are higher than the redox potential of the I−/I3− redox couple (0.4 V), demonstrating the feasibility of dye regeneration. In addition, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels are located around −1.09 to −1.05 V (Fig. 3 and Table S1†), obviously lower than that of the conduction band edge (ECB) of TiO2 (−0.5 V), which indicates the workable electron-injection from the excited sensitizers to the conduction band of TiO2.33

Theoretical calculations
To better understand the spatial distribution of the dialkoxy-TPE moiety, density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been carried out to reveal the optimized geometries of the dyes XW43 and XW71 (Fig. 4), with XW71 being used as the model compound for XW71–XW73 considering that they contain the identical donors. According to the optimized structures, the alkoxy chains attached at the propeller-like TPE entity are aligned in different directions, with one extended in a direction similar to that of the DEG chain in XW43 (Fig. 4), which is favorable for forming a compact dye layer on the TiO2 film to block I3−. Meanwhile, the other one is folded toward the porphyrin macrocycle, which may improve the anti-aggregation around the porphyrin core. This alignment characteristic of the alkoxy chains on the TPE entities is expected to afford high VOC values, which is consistent with the photovoltaic behavior (vide infra). Besides, the distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals displays the overlapped HOMO and LUMO (Fig. 4) favorable for efficient charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor.

Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs
The photovoltaic parameters of the DSSCs based on XW71–XW73 are listed in Table 2, with the J–V curves and the IPCE action spectra shown in Fig. 5. All the dialkoxy-TPE based dyes XW71–XW73 afford improved VOC values relative to that of XW43, which further confirms that the dialkoxy-TPE donor is favorable for suppressing dye aggregation and charge recombination, as expected from the theoretical calculations (vide supra).

Among these dyes, XW72 affords a VOC of 0.772 V, higher than the 0.765 V obtained for XW71. The elevated VOC may be ascribed to the capture of Li+ by the DEG chains surrounding the porphyrin core.47,48 However, XW72 exhibits a JSC of 19.23 mA cm−2, obviously lower than that of XW71 (20.67 mA cm−2), consistent with the lower plateau of the IPCE spectrum of XW72 (Fig. 5b). As a result, a lower efficiency of 10.3% has been obtained for XW72 owing to the offset of the high VOC by the much lower JSC. The lower JSC may result from the potential problem of Li+ over-trapping53,54 by the three DEG chains in XW72. To check this postulation, more LiI has been added into the electrolyte. Meanwhile, the concentration of another additive PMII was adjusted accordingly to maintain the constant total concentration of I− at 0.7 M. After employing more LiI, the resulting DSSCs based on XW72 exhibit a slightly enhanced JSC. However, the VOC is slightly lowered. As a result, the final PCE shows no significant change (Table S6†). Probably, the Li+ over-trapping is not a crucial factor accounting for the relatively low photovoltaic performance of XW72. Notably, benefiting from the cooperative effect of the dialkoxy-TPE donor and perfect protection of the porphyrin core by the strapped chains,46,49 a highest VOC of 0.777 V has been achieved for XW73. Consistent with the sequence of increasing VOC, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements reveal a decreasing chemical capacitance (Cμ) sequence of XW71 > XW72 > XW73 at a given bias voltage (e.g. 750 mV), with a reverse sequence of electron lifetimes (τ) (Fig. 6). These observations indicate the highest Fermi level and the lowest charge recombination rate for XW73, consistent with the highest VOC of XW73.55 Meanwhile, XW73 exhibits a relatively high JSC of 19.90 mA cm−2. Finally, a high PCE of 11.0% is achieved for XW73, which is obviously higher the 10.3% obtained for XW43.47
 Fig. 6  Plots of (a) Cμ and (b) τ versus the potential bias for the DSSCs based on XW71–XW73. 
In general, the IPCE value is determined by the light-harvesting efficiency (LHE), charge injection efficiency (ηinj), dye regeneration efficiency (ηreg) and charge collection efficiency (ηcc).52 Among them, similar UV-vis spectra of XW71–XW73 may result in similar LHE values.
Therefore, the other three parameters are crucial and they have been obtained by recording the photoluminescence (PL) decay using the time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) method.56 The PL decays for XW71–XW73 are measured on TiO2 and ZrO2 with the iodine electrolyte for estimating the ηinj and on TiO2 with the iodine and inert electrolytes for assessing the ηreg (Fig. S5†).57,58 As a result, the ηinj and ηreg of XW71–XW73 exhibit similar values in the small range of 90–93% (Table S3†), which may be rationalized by similar driving forces for electron injection and dye regeneration because of their similar energy levels. Accordingly, the differences in the JSC values of XW71–XW73 may be mainly related to ηcc. Thus, the Nyquist plots for the XW71–XW73 based DSSCs at a bias voltage of 0.75 V are analyzed (Fig. S6a†). The small and large semicircles correspond to the resistance for the electrolyte regeneration at the counter electrode (Rtr) and charge recombination between the injected electrons and oxidized electrolytes (Rrec), respectively. As listed in Table S4,† the Rtr values of XW71–XW73 are found to be 15.5, 8.2 and 9.7 Ω cm−2 and the corresponding Rrec values are 387.1 43.7 and 119.5 Ω cm−2, respectively. On this basis, the ηcc values are estimated to be 96%, 84% and 92% for XW71, XW72 and XW73, respectively, by using eqn (1) (ref. 56) (1)
The ηcc values agree well with the rank of the JSC values in the sequence of XW71 > XW73 > XW72.
Coadsorption and cosensitization
To further improve the PCEs, the coadsorption with CDCA has been systematically screened for suppressing dye-aggregation and charge recombination. Indeed, the presence of CDCA (Table S7†) leads to an improved VOC (10–15 mV) for XW71–XW73. However, a slight decrease in JSC is observed as a consequence of the reduced dye loading owing to the competitive adsorption effect (Table S7†). As a result, enhanced PCEs of 11.4%, 10.5% and 11.2% are achieved for XW71 + 2 mM CDCA, XW72 + 1 mM CDCA and XW73 + 2 mM CDCA, respectively.
Although CDCA can afford an enhanced VOC, it exhibits a negative impact on JSC. In addition, the weak absorption of the porphyrin dyes at around 400 and 550 nm results in the inferior IPCE in the corresponding wavelength ranges. To address this problem, it is necessary to further improve the JSC by co-sensitization.59 Based on our previous work, XC3 (Fig. S1†) has been used as the co-sensitizer together with the use of CDCA as the coadsorbent.50 Expectedly, the valleys in the IPCE action spectra at around 400 and 550 nm of XW71–XW73 are filled up (Fig. 7). As a result, the JSC has been significantly improved accompanied with the elevated VOC (Table 2), leading to an enhanced PCE of 11.3–12.3%. It should be noted that the relative deviations between the integral JSC values calculated from the IPCE curves and those obtained from the J–V tests lie within the range of 12–18% (Table 2 and Fig. S7†), comparable with the errors in earlier reports.60,61 This observation can be rationalized by different testing conditions between J–V and IPCE measurements. The full irradiation applied in the J–V test may generate more electrons and even heat in the device, leading to higher JSC, while the similar effects are much weaker for the wavelength-dependent irradiation in the IPCE test.52

Photostability
Long-term photostability is a crucial factor for practical applications of DSSCs. Considering the outstanding photovoltaic behavior of the XW73 + CDCA + XC3 system, the long-term photostability has been recorded, which reveals that the DSSCs show nice durability and afford ca. 89% of the initial efficiency (from 12.3% to 11.0%) after soaking under one sun conditions for 500 h at 25 °C (Fig. 8).

Conclusions
In summary, a dialkoxy-substituted TPE moiety has been introduced into the phenothiazine donor of our previously reported porphyrin dye XW43 to afford a novel porphyrin dye XW71. On this basis, XW72 and XW73 have been synthesized by replacing the dodecyloxy moieties on the meso-phenyl substituents of XW71 with two diethyleneglycol (DEG) chains and double straps, respectively. DFT calculations reveal that the alkoxy chains on the TPE moieties are extended outward from the molecule and folded toward the porphyrin macrocycle, respectively, favorable for suppressing dye aggregation and charge recombination, resulting in high VOC values for XW71–XW73 (0.765 V–0.777 V). According to the Nyquist plots, charge collection efficiencies are estimated to be 96%, 84% and 92% for XW71, XW72 and XW73, respectively, lying in the same sequence as that of the JSC values (20.67, 19.23 and 19.90 mA cm−2, respectively). As a result, the highest PCE of 11.0% has been achieved for XW73. Upon simultaneous coadsorption with CDCA and cosensitization with XC3, the VOC and JSC are dramatically improved owing to the enhanced anti-aggregation and the compensation for the absorption defects at ca. 400 and 550 nm. Thus, the XW73 + CDCA + XC3 system affords the highest efficiency of 12.3%. Overall, this work presents a promising way for developing efficient DSSCs by introducing an alkoxy-substituted TPE entity into porphyrin sensitizers and optimizing wrapping and strapping moieties, in combination with coadsorption and cosensitization approaches. However, the porphyrin sensitizers in this work still require additives like co-sensitizers and co-adsorbents to enhance PCEs, which may lead to complex cell fabrication processes. One promising method for addressing this issue is to develop a novel class of sensitizers named “concerted companion (CC) dyes” by covalently linking a porphyrin moiety and an organic dye moiety with complementary absorption through a flexible chain.62,63 This class of sensitizers show the “intramolecular co-sensitization” effect, which would overcome the disadvantages of the commonly used “intermolecular co-sensitization” approach. On this basis, systematic modification of CC dyes to suppress the charge-recombination may give high PCEs based on an individual sensitizer without resorting to a co-adsorbent such as CDCA. Further work in this respect for developing more efficient sensitizer molecules is underway in our group.
