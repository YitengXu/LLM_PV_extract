    , Accepted 18th April 2023First published on 19th April 2023AbstractSurface passivation by organic dyes has been an effective strategy for simultaneous enhancement of the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells. However, lack of in-depth understanding of how subtle structural changes in dyes leads to distinctly different passivation effects is a challenge for screening effective passivation molecules (PMs). In an experiment done by Han et al. (Adv. Energy Mater., 2019, 9, 1803766), three donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) dyes (SP1, SP2, and SP3) with distinct electron donors have been applied to passivate the perovskite surface, where the efficiency and stability of PSCs are quite different. Herein, we carried out first-principles calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations on the structures and electronic properties of SP1, SP2, SP3, and their passivated perovskite surfaces. Our results showed that SP3 enhances the carrier transfer rate, electric field, and absorption region compared to SP1 and SP2. Moreover, AIMD simulations reveal that the cooperative multiple interactions of O–Pb, S–Pb, and H–I between SP3 and the perovskite surface result in a stronger passivation effect in a humid environment than that of SP1 and SP2. This work is expected to pave the way for screening dye passivation molecules to endow perovskite solar cells with high efficiency and stability.
1. Introduction
Halide perovskite materials (e.g. MAPbI3) have received widespread attention due to their exceptional photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications.1,2 The most prominent advancement is that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has exceeded 25.7%3 since perovskites were first employed as absorbers in 2009.4 However, perovskite materials are prone to substantial degradation5 when exposed to environmental oxygen,6 moisture,7 heating,8 and light illumination.9 In particular, water molecules easily penetrate into the surfaces of the perovskite, making the performance of the perovskite-based device significantly worse.10 The industrialization of perovskite-based devices is constrained by the unsatisfactory stability of perovskite materials.11 The defects on the surface and grain boundaries of perovskite materials are mainly represented by insufficient coordination of cations or halide anions, which causes non-radiative charge recombination.12 Choosing suitable passivation molecules plays a key role in reducing the defect density of perovskite materials.13 Lewis bases with lone pairs of electrons, such as oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms, have been demonstrated to effectively passivate the surface of undercoordinated Pb2+ ions in perovskite films.14 A Lewis acid–base interaction originates from the electron donating or accepting process between a perovskite surface and PMs.15
D–π–A type metal-free organic dyes, which are composed of an electron donor, a π-bridge, and an electron acceptor, have attracted significant attention in dye-sensitized solar cells16 due to their remarkable advantages such as large absorption wavelength, high efficiency, tunable molecules with optoelectronic properties, lower cost of large-scale production, good chemical stability, and flexible electron density distribution.13,17 Researchers have designed and synthesized a large number of D–π–A dye sensitizers, through the continuous exploration and improvement of the structures of the three parts (D, π, and A).18 Modification of the D–π–A dye on the surface of the perovskite materials is an effective strategy to improve the optoelectronic performance and stability of PSCs.19 D–π–A dyes can be used as electron transport materials,20 hole transporting materials,21 and passivators22 of PSCs due to the following unique features: the D–π–A molecule has a conjugated backbone structure for efficient charge carrier transport;19 the incorporation of the dye molecule can improve the light harvesting performance of the photoactive layer; and the electron density distribution of the anchoring groups can be modulated to passivate perovskite surface defects.22 D–π–A dyes have been used as PMs for PSCs.23,24 D–π–A type porphyrin derivatives (CS0–CS2) improved the film crystallinity, reduced the defect density, and increased the PCE. In addition, long alkyl chains of porphyrin dyes inhibited the invasion of moisture, which improved the stability of the device.25 Xin et al. used p-phenylenediamine, terephthalonitrile, and 4-aminobenzonitrile to reveal the effect of different electron densities on defect passivation in perovskite thin films.26 The results showed that compared with p-phenylenediamine and terephthalonitrile with symmetrical substitution, the D–π–A structure of 4-aminobenzonitrile with noteworthy electronic polarity provided better binding with the undercoordinated Pb2+ defects and boosted the PCE from 20.22% to 21.02% and improved the stability in humid air.26 In 2018, Han et al. passivated the halide perovskite film with the D–π–A dyes AQ310, which reduced the trap states of under-coordinated Pb2+ ions by forming coordination with the –COOH group. At the same time, the PSCs showed good moisture stability due to AQ310 with multiple hydrophobic alkyl chains.27 Then, three other D–π–A molecules with different electron donating abilities (CTA-F, CTA-OMe, and CDTA) were selected by Han's group to passivate the tin-base perovskite solar cells.28 Compared to CTA-F and CTA-OMe with moderate electron-donating units, the strong electron-donating triphenylamine unit in CDTA significantly increased the electron density of Lewis base groups, resulting in the formation of a more stable Lewis adduct.28 Consequently, the CDTA-treated device showed a compact and uniform perovskite film and retarded the permeation of moisture into perovskite crystals.28
In 2013, Han et al. employed two small and simple organic dyes SP2 and SP3 with the D–π–A configuration as co-sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells.29 By adjusting the electron donor and side alkyl chain lengths, the spectral photoresponse of the dye was greatly enhanced from the UV to the whole visible region. In 2019, the same group used the D–π–A configuration organic dyes SP2 and SP3 to passivate defects in perovskites, and added SP1 for comparison to explain the influence of different electron donors on the passivation effect of MAPbI3.30 The three D–π–A dyes have the same π-spacer (thiophene) and acceptor parts (cyanoacetic acid), but different donor parts (phenyl for SP1, butoxyphenyl for SP2, and N,N-dibutylaminophenyl for SP3) as shown in Fig. 1. Compared with the reference device, the PCEs of SP1, SP2, and SP3 passivated PSCs were increased from 18.52% to 18.75%, 19.72%, and 20.43%, respectively. After 30 days of aging, the PCE of control, SP1-passivated, SP2-passivated, and SP3-passivated devices respectively retained 63%, 71%, 76%, and 86%. Although these D–π–A molecules can be successfully introduced into perovskite systems to enhance the device performance, the micro-mechanism is not fully understood. The reason why the three D–π–A molecules with similar structures exhibit different passivation effects is expected to be explored. In order to select and design the compatible D–π–A molecules as PMs of perovskite systems, it is necessary to reveal the relationship between the structure of PMs and the passivation effect, which is conducive to further enhancing the optoelectronic performance and stability of PSCs.

In this manuscript, the structure and electronic properties of the three D–π–A passivation molecules, SP1, SP2, and SP3, together with the interfacial properties between the passivation molecule and the perovskite surface have been analyzed and compared based on DFT calculations. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were performed to examine the MAPbI3 stability in the presence of the three different passivators (SP1, SP2, and SP3) under humid conditions. It was discovered that cooperative multiple interactions were the main reason for the passivation effect and stability. Our work provides ideas for the selection of D–π–A dye passivation molecules with enhanced stability in humid environments.
2. Computational details
We optimized the geometry of isolated PMs at the B3LYP/6-31G(d, p)31–33 level. All optimized geometries show no imaginary frequency, which ensures they are energetic minima. The solvent effects were taken into account by using the polarized continuum model34 in chlorobenzene solvent. The calculations were implemented using the Gaussian16 soft package.35 The TD-MN1536 functional was selected to study the absorption spectra for the three PMs by comparing many popular functionals. The adsorption of PMs on MAPbI3 was denoted by PM@MAPbI3. The interfacial structure, optical and electronic properties of PM@MAPbI3 systems were carried out by the Vienna ab initio simulation (VASP)37–39 package with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)40 together with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)41 exchange–correlation functional. The van der Waals interactions were taken into account with the supplemented DFT-D3 calculations.42 The (001) halide perovskite surface orientation43 with the PbI2 termination44 was the focus of the study because the surface is stable. The simulations were performed on a 192-atom MAPbI3 (4 × 2) (001) surface. A vacuum buffer space of 20 Å was added along the surface normal to avoid unnecessary inter-slab interactions, and the simulation cell is 25.0 Å × 12.5 Å × 41 Å. A Γ-centered 2 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh was employed. The convergence criteria for the geometry optimization was 500 eV for the cutoff energy, 10−4 eV for the convergence threshold for self-consistent-field iteration, and 0.05 eV Å−1 for atomic forces. During the geometry optimization step, the atoms in the bottom layer were fixed and the other atoms were relaxed.
AIMD calculations for these systems were investigated using the CP2K program45–47 in the NVT ensemble to understand the humidity stability of the PM@MAPbI3 system. A humid environment was considered by placing four water molecules at the same location in the PM@MAPbI3 system as the starting geometry. Each trajectory was simulated at a target temperature of 300 K for 30 ps with an atomic time step of 1 fs. The snapshots of AIMD trajectories were plotted using the Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) program.48
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structures and electronic properties of PMs
Investigation of the structural and electronic properties of PMs at the atomic level is a prerequisite for understanding their passivation effects. The optimized ground-state structures of the three passivation molecules SP1, SP2, and SP3 are in Fig. 1(a), which belong to the D–π–A type with the same π-spacer and electron acceptor, and different electron donors. The dihedral angles (DSCCC) between thiophene and the benzene ring are 25.7°, 21.1°, and 16.4° for SP1, SP2, and SP3, respectively. This shows that the coplanarity between the electron donor and π-spacer increases gradually from SP1 to SP3. The good coplanarity of the D–π–A molecule is beneficial for electron delocalization.49
The electrostatic potential (ESP) is of great significance for investigating intermolecular electrostatic interactions and predicting reaction sites and molecular properties.50,51 The ESP pictures of the three passivation molecules are shown in Fig. 1(b), where red, white, and blue colors represent negative, neutral, and positive charge regions, respectively. The positive charges are distributed on the hydrogen atoms in thiophene, benzene, and alkyl chains. The maximum value is mainly distributed over the hydrogen atom in the carboxylic acid. The negative charges are located on nitrogen and oxygen atoms in cyanoacetic acid. Depending on the distribution of electrostatic potential, cyanoacetic acid of the electron acceptor part is expected to act as the anchor, providing lone-pair electrons to coordinate with Pb2+ cations on the perovskite surface. In addition, the three PMs have high dipole moments up to 4.69, 5.16, and 8.68 Debye for SP1, SP2, and SP3, respectively due to the different donor parts. The increased dipole moment leads to the strong polarity of PMs, which provides a dipole field for the charge separation in the perovskite film.52
Reorganization energy (λ) is an important parameter reflecting the charge transfer rate. The λ is defined by the following formula:53–56 λ =[E±0 − E±±] + [E± − E0](1)where E±0 is the energy of the cation or anion calculated on the basis of the optimized neutral molecule; E±± is the energy of the cation or anion calculated based on the respective optimized cation or anion; E± is the energy of the neutral molecule calculated based on the respective optimized cation or anion, and E0 is the energy of the neutral molecule in its ground state. It is generally believed that the lower reorganization energy leads to a higher charge transfer rate.57 As shown in Fig. 1(c), the hole reorganization energy (λh) and electron reorganization energy (λe) for SP3 are lower than those of SP1 and SP2, which means that the carriers of SP3 are transported more quickly.
The light absorption of the perovskite materials is not enough to cover the full solar spectrum.19 In dye-sensitized solar cells, dyes serve as light absorbers to capture solar energy and convert photons to electrons.58 Therefore, some dyes are introduced to the perovskite system to enhance the light harvesting properties of the device.59 On the basis of ground-state geometry, the absorption spectra of the three PMs are plotted in Fig. 1(d). The maximum absorption peak shifts from 379 nm to 462 nm and the oscillator strength increases according to the order of SP1, SP2, and SP3.
The hydrophobic property of passivation molecules is evaluated from the following formula: ,60 in which logPchlorobenzene/water is the log10 of partition coefficient, Echlorobenzene is the single point of energy under chlorobenzene, and Ewater is the single point of energy in water. The logPchlorobenzene/water values of SP1, SP2, and SP3 are 4.07, 5.67, and 7.95, respectively. Thus, SP3 presents the most outstanding hydrophobic property among the three passivation molecules, which facilitates SP3-based devices to be more stable under the humidity conditions. This is consistent with the experimental results.30
3.2 Structures and binding energies of PM@MAPbI3
It is necessary to study the interfacial properties of the PM@MAPbI3 systems, which are closer to the real environment than the isolated PMs. The passivation effect of molecules depends on the interaction between passivation molecules and the perovskite surface. The electrostatic potential analysis shows that the three passivation molecules have multiple functional groups and therefore contain multiple adsorption sites of oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and hydrogen. To select the most stable adsorption model of PMs onto the perovskite surface, PM molecules are located horizontally, vertically, and laterally on the surface of MAPbI3. The optimized stable structures and the corresponding adsorption energies (Eads) of the three adsorption modes are displayed in Fig. 2 and Fig. S1 (ESI†). The negative adsorption energy value implies that the passivation molecules spontaneously attach to the MAPbI3 surface. It can be found that the D–π–A molecules in the horizontal direction on the perovskite surface are the most stable.
 Fig. 2  Interfacial structures of SP1@MAPbI3, SP2@MAPbI3, and SP3@MAPbI3. Representative O–Pb lengths in Å are marked on the chart. The H–I (blue), S–Pb (yellow), N–Pb (dark red), and Od–Pb (red) bonds are indicated with dashed lines, and the bond lengths are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Colour code: red, O; blue, N; bright yellow, S; brown, C; white, H; purple, I; and leaden, Pb. 
Hence only the cases of horizontal adsorption are considered and further analyzed. The absolute values of the adsorption energies are 1.62, 2.10, and 2.61 eV for SP1@MAPbI3, SP2@MAPbI3, and SP3@MAPbI3. From the top view in Fig. 2, the three passivation molecules spread over the perovskite surface. The oxygen of the carboxyl group is on one lead atom, while the sulfur atom in thiophene interacts with the adjacent lead atoms. Lewis acid–base interactions are mainly located between the oxygen (electron rich) atom of carboxylic acid and the Pb (electron deficient) atom on the perovskite surface. The O–Pb distances between the carbonyl oxygen atom and the perovskite lead atom are 2.54, 2.51, and 2.48 Å in SP1@MAPbI3, SP2@MAPbI3, and SP3@MAPbI3, respectively. Compared with the SP1 molecule, SP2 has a butoxy group with one alkyl side chain. The Od indicates the oxygen atom in the butoxyphenyl donor, thus adding one Od–Pb interaction in SP2@MAPbI3. The N,N-dibutylamine group of the two alkyl side chains is introduced into SP3, which adds one N–Pb interaction in SP3@MAPbI3. Simultaneously, multiple hydrogen atoms in thiophene, benzene ring, or alkyl chains are close to multiple iodine atoms. The H–I, S–Pb, N–Pb, and Od–Pb interactions are marked with blue, yellow, dark red, and red dashed lines in Fig. 2, and the corresponding distances are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). They provide additional interactions between perovskite and the passivation molecules. The H–I distances between the H atoms of passivation molecules and the I atoms on the perovskite surfaces range from 3.03 Å to 3.61 Å. The numbers of possible H–I interactions are three, five, and seven for SP1@MAPbI3, SP2@MAPbI3, and SP3@MAPbI3, respectively. The H–I interactions are non-negligible when molecules are adsorbed on the perovskite surface in a horizontal adsorption manner.10 The S–Pb distances are 3.86, 3.88, and 3.84 Å in SP1@MAPbI3, SP2@MAPbI3, and SP3@MAPbI3, respectively. More additional interactions bring the PMs closer to the perovskite surface. Long et al. demonstrated that bidentate D-4-tert-butylphenylalanine (D4TBP) with two spatially separated binding sites is preferred, with a good match to the MAPbI3 crystal structure.61 Lattice matching between the passivating molecule and perovskite can lead to a benign passivation effect. Therefore, the strongest adsorption energy, the shortest O–Pb distance, and more additional interactions are expected to have the most lasting passivation effect of SP3@MAPbI3 among the three systems.
3.3 Electronic property of PM@MAPbI3
Understanding the interfacial charge transfer is crucial for the design and development of high-performance perovskite devices. The electron density difference lobes represent the change of the electron density in Fig. 3. Bader charge analysis suggests that 0.015, 0.026, and 0.017 electrons are transferred from the perovskite to SP1, SP2, and SP3, respectively, which facilitates the further transfer of electrons to the nearby electron transfer layer.10 A built-in electric field is induced at the interface, which can be seen in the z-direction planar-averaged charge difference in Fig. 3(d). The interface of SP3@MAPbI3 produces a prominent high electric field distribution relative to those of SP1@MAPbI3 and SP2@MAPbI3, resulting in a larger electric field, which indicates a better separation of electrons and holes.62

The isosurface level for charge density difference was set to be 0.001 e bohr−3. The yellow and cyan colors indicate charge accumulation and depletion, respectively.

Fig. 4 shows the projected density of states (PDOS), band structures, and the charge densities of the valence band maximum (VBM), the trap state, and the conduction band minimum (CBM) of pristine and passivated systems. The VBM of MAPbI3 is mainly contributed by the 5p orbitals of I atoms, while the CBM mainly consists of the 6p orbitals of Pb atoms. It can be seen that the band gap of MAPbI3 is 1.42 eV, which is consistent with previous studies.63–65 Compared to the pristine system, a straight band line is present near the CBM at 1.11 eV in SP1@MAPbI3, which is contributed by the SP1 molecule. In SP2@MAPbI3, a trap state introduced by SP2 at 1.21 eV is closer to the CBM than that of SP1. In addition, SP1 or SP2 introduces occupied states close to the conduction band, providing additional states for the holes and favoring the overall photocurrents.10 In SP3@MAPbI3, a different scenario emerges. A trap state introduced by the SP3 molecule occurs near the valence band at −0.24 eV, which reduces the band gap of the system. Depending on the charge density of the VBM, the trap states, and the CBM, SP3 reduces the overlap between the trap states and the CBM. It can be inferred that the reduced energy level of the non-radiation coupling between these states inhibits the recombination between electrons and holes.66

3.4 Optical properties of PM@MAPbI3
The optical properties of MAPbI3, SP1@MAPbI3, SP2@MAPbI3, and SP3@MAPbI3 systems are simulated to understand the effect of the three different D–π–A molecules on light absorption. The UV-vis absorption spectrum of the pristine PbI2-terminated MAPbI3 surface in Fig. 5 shows efficient light absorption, which is consistent with the literature.30 The simulated absorption spectra show that passivation of the D–π–A dye does not affect the light absorption of perovskite at 300–500 nm. Small absorption peaks around 600, 710, and 900 nm are observed in SP1@MAPbI3, SP2@MAPbI3, and SP3@MAPbI3, respectively. The UV region corresponds to the characteristic light absorption of MAPbI3 while the visible region from 600 nm to 900 nm corresponds to the absorption of the D–π–A dye molecules. This phenomenon indicates that PMs extend the absorption region. The spectral response range and absorption intensity of the MAPbI3, SP1@MAPbI3, SP2@MAPbI3, and SP3@MAPbI3 systems are consistent with the variation trend of JSC in the experiment.30 The SP3 molecule significantly improved the light harvesting property of the PSC device. Therefore, the D–π–A organic dye molecules act as passivators and provide additional light absorption bands in the visible region, which is important for the halide perovskite light absorbers. It is worth noting that the obtained spectrum shows a band at 600–900 nm for the dye molecules in Fig. 5, which has somewhat redshifted compared to the experiment. This phenomenon may be caused by the underestimated HOMO–LUMO gap without consideration of the SOC effects.67

3.5 Molecular dynamics of PM@MAPbI3 with H2O
To comprehensively understand the stability of the perovskite surface before and after passivation in a humid environment, we performed AIMD simulations on the systems of PM@MAPbI3 with four water molecules. Fig. S3 (ESI†) displays the selected snapshots of the studied PM@MAPbI3/H2O systems during 30 ps simulations. In the case of the MAPbI3/H2O system, water molecules tend to move toward the perovskite surface and penetrate into the perovskite system at 6 ps, suggesting the water-susceptibility nature of the bare perovskite surface and the deformation of the inorganic scaffold afterward.68–70 In PM@MAPbI3/H2O systems, water molecules possessing nucleophilic oxygen atoms and electrophilic hydrogen atoms vibrate and gradually aggregate near the carboxyl group and form hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl group. Fig. 6 shows the variations in the O–Pb distance between the O atom in the anchoring group and the Pb atom on the perovskite surface and the S–Pb distance between the S atom in thiophene and the adjacent Pb atom. In the SP1@MAPbI3/H2O system, water molecules tend to weaken the Pb–O bond between the carboxyl group and MAPbI3 surface, resulting in dramatic fluctuation of the Pb–O and Pb–S distances. The Pb–O and Pb–S bond distances exceed 6 Å at 5 ps, and the water drives the passivator to drift across the perovskite surface. This indicates that the water molecules gradually weaken the passivation effect of SP1, which can be attributed to the weak interaction between SP1 and MAPbI3. In the SP2@MAPbI3/H2O system, the Pb–O distance changes significantly, while the Pb–S distance changes slightly. It could be inferred that the passivation effect of the SP2 molecule is better than that of SP1. The well-maintained Pb–O and Pb–S bond interactions indicate that SP3 can steadily adsorb on the perovskite surface in the SP3@MAPbI3/H2O system. It is known that electrons and holes are located on the inorganic lattice and constitute the creation of the majority of nonadiabatic electron–phonon coupling.71 The inorganic scaffold of the SP3@MAPbI3/H2O system is stable, and MAPbI3 maintains its integrity, which can reduce electron–phonon coupling.
 Fig. 6  Variation of the (a) Pb–O and (b) Pb–S distances for SP1@MAPbI3/H2O, SP2@MAPbI3/H2O, and SP3@MAPbI3/H2O systems. 
These three PMs act as protective layers but their effects are different. The height of the O atoms in water molecules changes along the AIMD trajectories as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). In SP1@MAPbI3, one water molecule penetrates into the perovskite cavity at 16 ps due to the large interspace on the MAPbI3 surface, but the deformation of the inorganic scaffold reduces compared to the unpassivated MAPbI3 system. Introducing a butoxy group with one alkyl side chain in SP2 leads to a smaller interspace on the MAPbI3 surface than that in SP1@MAPbI3. This causes water to enter into the MAPbI3 lattice until approximately 19 ps since it has a more rigid inorganic frame than SP1@MAPbI3. Contrary to the SP1 and SP2 passivated surfaces, the penetration of the water molecule into the perovskite underlayer is not observed in the rigid inorganic framework for SP3@MAPbI3, because the largest volume of SP3 covers more Pb and I atoms on the perovskite surface. There are more interactions between SP3 and MAPbI3, which effectively inhibits the water-induced deterioration in the perovskite surface. The AIMD simulations reveal that the multiple interactions cause a synergistic passivation effect of PM@MAPbI3 systems. It is worth noting that the SP3 molecule not only presents the best passivation effect on the perovskite surface but also significantly inhibits the penetration of moisture into the perovskite surface. This agrees well with the experimental observations that the three D–π–A passivation molecules show different effects on the stability of the perovskite surface.30
4. Discussion
In this study, we investigated the structure of a series of D–π–A dyes, the interface properties of the PM@MAPbI3 systems, and the interaction between water and the passivated perovskite surfaces, which are key aspects affecting the performance and stability of PSCs. PMs with an optimal binding configuration can generate outstanding passivation effectiveness. Some efforts have been devoted to the spatial configuration of PMs and have provided valuable guidance for designing and screening PMs. For example, theophylline, caffeine, and theobromine were shown by Wang et al. to share identical functional groups as the passivation molecules. However, theophylline presents the best passivation effect due to its ideal N–H and CO configuration.72 A bidentate molecule can increase the anchoring strength on perovskite surfaces. Zhu et al. showed that compared to the monodentate pyridine and p-toluenethiol, the passivation of bidentate molecule 2-MP on the MAPbI3 film remarkably enhanced tolerance toward chlorobenzene washing and vacuum heating, which significantly improved the passivation stability of PSCs.73 Based on 2-MP, we designed and investigated a series of passivation molecules, 2-MEP, 2-MDEP, 2-MTEP, and 2-MQEP with different lengths of alkyl chains. Because adequate alkyl chain extension helps to improve interface interaction, 2-MDEP is the most promising surface passivators.74,75 The experiment of Wu et al. demonstrated that a slight modification in D–π–A passivation molecules, like the electron donor, might produce noticeable variations in the photovoltaic properties and stability of perovskite.30 When cyanoacetic acid acts as the acceptor part of D–π–A dyes, the strong electronegative oxygen atom passivates the perovskite surface through coordination with uncoordinated Pb2+. The sulfur in thiophene as the π-spacer can produce the S–Pb interaction. Because of different electron-donors, the three D–π–A dyes produce different additional O(N)–Pb and I–H interactions. The presence of hydrogen bonds can fix the iodine atom, prevent the formation of iodine-vacancy defects and reduce the hysteresis effect.76 The multiple interactions can effectively block water from approaching the perovskite surface and give the perovskite considerable moisture stability. Different degrees of multiple interactions synergize to produce different passivation effects. The strong O–Pb bond and additional multiple N–Pb and H–I interactions in SP3@MAPbI3 make SP3 better anchored on the perovskite lattice. Multiple interactions between the D–π–A dye and the perovskite surface can be formed due to the good match between the molecular configuration of the passivator and the lattice structure of the perovskite.
According to our theoretical analysis, when selecting and designing a perovskite passivator, the molecular configuration of the passivator should be considered first. If the molecule contains multiple heteroatoms, such as O, N, and S, and the distance between them is consistent with the two adjacent Pb on the perovskite surface, and multiple Lewis acid–base interactions can be formed. If H atoms on the aromatic ring or branch chain can form multiple additional interactions with I atoms of the perovskite, a stable passivation effect will be produced. Different D–π–A molecules produce varying numbers of interaction sites, which in turn results in different adsorption energies and ultimately variable passivation effects on the perovskite surface. Apart from the interactions between dyes and perovskites, there might also be cooperative interactions between dye adsorbates. The configurations and functions of dyes at high coverage may be very different,77 so H- or J-aggregates of dyes on the MAPbI3 surface need to be considered in the future.
5. Conclusions
In this computational work we have investigated the structure of three similar D–π–A molecules (SP1, SP2, and SP3) and elucidated the different passivation effects of the three passivators and the moisture resistance of PM@MAPbI3 systems. We discover that among the three D–π–A molecules, SP3 has the best coplanarity and the smallest recombination energy, suggesting that it facilitates charge separation and charge transport. The D–π–A passivation molecules with multiple interaction sites can passivate Pb and I atoms simultaneously on the perovskite surface. For the PM@MAPbI3 interfaces, SP3 with N,N-dibutylaminophenyl as the donor moiety exhibits a superior adsorption ability and light absorption. Moreover, SP3@MAPbI3 possesses favorable built-in electric field distribution compared with SP1@MAPbI3 and SP2@MAPbI3. The AIMD simulation reveals that the PMs enhance the stability of perovskite when exposed to moisture. The steady multiple interactions of O/S–Pb prevent H2O from entering the perovskite surface, which is consistent with the experimental results. The synergistic multiple interactions of SP3 significantly improve the stability of perovskite. A tiny modification of the molecules can lead to significantly different electronic and optical properties of the halide perovskite materials. We demonstrate that factors such as lattice matching, multiple interaction sites, and the large adsorption energy, are of vital importance for choosing passivation agents.
